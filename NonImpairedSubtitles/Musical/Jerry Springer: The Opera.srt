We had some fun.

237
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,320
We lived on dreams.

Now. why would you cheat
on your best friend?

264
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:04,280
He'd come round. Know what

265
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,480

Your partner has cheated on you.
Your best friend has betrayed you.

271
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,840
You don't have to put up with this.
You're the innocent one here.

272
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,200
A weird thing happened last night
when l went to take a leak.

273
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,800
l ended up pissing on a man
with a glorious physique.

274
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:54,520
l said ''What on earth are you doing
on the restroom floor?''

275
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,200
He said. ''Don't ask stupid questions.

276
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:03,600
just piss on me some more.''

277
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,840
''Piss on me. you whore.''

278
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:15,680
l pissed some more.

279
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,640
l guess we all got our flaws. Jerry.

280
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,920
Well. l'm confused here. Peaches.

281
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,880

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,720
Well. l guess you got away with it
this time. Dwight.

284
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:42,960
Jerry.

285
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,840
Jerry.

286
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,440
lt's OK. it's my inner Valkyrie.

287
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,320
How can l help you today?

288
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,160
Jerry makes the morons fight.

289
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,800
but how does Jerry sleep at night?

290
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,600
How do l sleep? l sleep on my back.
Thank you.

291
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,800
You know. it's easy to occupy
the moral high ground.

292
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,000
What's more diflicult
is to confidently occupy

293
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:15,520
the moral low ground. Go away.

294
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,680
So. Dwight. you told our producers
before the show

295

299
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,160
What the fuck? What the fuck?

300
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,400
- Bring 'em on.

00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,080
Tacky. tack-tack. tack-tacky queen.

309
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,240
Hush all your shouting.
You can hush all your bitching.

310
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:27,440
You can talk to the hand
cos the face ain't listening.

311
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,880
Loser.

317
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,520
Look at little piggy.
See how she squeals.

318
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,600
My advice to you. bitch.
get a face peel.

319
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,560
- Loser. loser. butt boy.
- To the hand.

320
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,680
Loser. loser. butt boy.

321
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,320
Hush your dirty mouth.
my tubby lady chimp.

322
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,480
Lose the facial hair
and you might find a pimp.

323
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,120

Now get.

507
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,640
Some people like to relax in casinos.

508
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,880
others get their kicks
shoving powder up their nose.

509
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,480
That's how it is.

510
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,480
That's how it is.

511
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,200
That's how it is.
That's how it is.

512
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:10,800
Some people chill with a pill
or a reefer.

513
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,800
others like to eat their lunch
off a whore's beaver.

514
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,280
That's how it is.

515
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:19,000
That's how it is.

516
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:23,080
For some. morning mass.
for others. hairy ass.

517
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,480
l got a need. a special desire.

518
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:31,720
a little thing. a harmless thing
which sets my soul on fire.

519
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:35,840
which sends me spinning into space
and puts me in a trance.

520
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,320
A little thing. a harmless thing.

521
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,440
A little thing. a harmless thing.

522
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,920

00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,760
lt might seem pathetic.
might show a lack of class.

526
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,240
l only feel the real me

527
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,360

528
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,240

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,360
Andrea is your partner of two years.

569
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,800
Surely you must have something
to say to her.

570
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:11,520

593
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,240
Diaper pooping. Diaper pooping.

594
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,040
- Diaper.
- Baby. please.

595

Dia-Dia-Dia-Diaper.

601
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,920
More guilt after the break.
Don't go away.

602
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:03,480
l want to sing something beautiful.

603
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:05,080

l want to sing something positive.

605
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:14,280
Why don't we carry this on
in the greenroom?

606
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:20,160
l want to learn how to dream again.

607
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:24,880
To feel again.

608
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,560

00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:50,320
bathed in the light

613
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,680
of rainbows.

614
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,000
With spring in my heart

615
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:03,200
and love by my side.

616
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,800
Oh. stay with me. Stay with me.

617
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,040
Stay with me. baby.

618
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:14,600
Stay with me. Stay with me.

619
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:21,080
Stay with me. baby.

620
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:33,400
No motivation.

621
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:38,600
No idea. No aim.

622
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,720
No problem.

623
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,520
No worries.

624
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:52,200
Novocaine.

625
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:57,240
Buy a gun. Buy a big gun.

626
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,240
Have some fun with a big gun.

627
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,440
Ooh. look at my gun.
Look at my big gun.

628
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:05,360
Ooh. look at my gun. Look at my
big gun. You could have a gun. too.

629
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,800
Yes. you could have a gun. too.
but you gotta buy it first.

630
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,960
Bounce back.

631
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:15,040
Bounce back.

632
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:20,480
Bounce back with Prozac.

633
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,200
Give in to Jesus.

634
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:32,400
Give in to Jesus
or alternatively die.

635
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:39,400
Die a ho-o-o-o-o-o-orrible.

636
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,440
die a horrible death. Jesus.

637
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,880
The first time l saw Jerry on TV.

638
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,440
l knew that there was hope for me.

639
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:05,120
When l saw how he worked the crowd.

640
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:10,800
l knew that he could help me out.

641
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,000
Before that. l was empty inside.

642
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,680
l had considered suicide.

643
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:29,200
But now l'm a vital member
of Jerry's team.

644
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:37,240
But sometimes l wonder
how much he values me.

645
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,040
What the fuck is that
idiot warm-up man doing out there?

646
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,520
He's turning my people
into a mob.

647
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:46,840
You're right. Steve. he's got to go.

648
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,160
Hey. Jerry. what can l say. man?
Tough crowd.

649
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:52,600
Nice to see you. Jonathan.

650
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:57,200
Sorry if l let those assholes
get a little too loud.

651
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,320
Those assholes are my audience.

652
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,200
Jerry. don't bullshit me.

653
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:07,240
You and me both.
we know they are scum.

654
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,040
Filthy cocksucking scum.

655
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:11,800
Your job is to control those scum

656
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,080
and keep them from
upstaging my guests.

657
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:16,440
Pimps and perverts. teenage whores.

658
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:20,400
people so fat they get
stuck in revolving doors.

659
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,600
And we get them through those doors
and onto a plane to Chicago.

660
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:27,520
Sluts and faggots.

661
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,000
gimps eating maggots.

662
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:33,720
We never had a maggot-eating gimp
on this show.

663
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,760
- Jerry. you could do anything.
- What are you talking about?

664
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,480
You could run for Senate
or even president.

665
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:42,760
lf l want my dick sucked.
l'll call my agent.

666
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,880
Looks like you're cruising.
playing it safe.

667
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,880
You're way out of line. pal.

668
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,880
You need a challenge
and l got just the thing.

669
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,480
Gonna make you sweat
when you're in the ring.

670
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:59,280
Jonathan. let's cut this short.

671
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:04,080
You need help. Help and a new job.

672
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:06,160
No! You...

673
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:09,200
So thanks for this little chat.

674
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,960
Oh. and good luck
in the warm-up industry.

675
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,520
Sorry. faggots. if l'm outta line.

676
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,280
Sorry if l'm taking
too much of your time.

677
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,400
Mister Fucking Big Shot.
sun shines out his ass.

678
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,160
take your job and shove it.
It's been such a blast.

679
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,320
That's the last we'll see of him.

680
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,480
Fuck you. Fuck you.
Fuck you. Fuck you.

681
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,400
l'm so lonely.

682
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,760
That went well.

683
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,760
You know. when l was a younger man.

684
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,480
l was passionate about civil rights.

685
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,520
education. the antiwar movement.

686
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:01,160
l was even elected
to the city council.

687
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:08,880
And then one day.
l. er. l went to a prostitute.

688
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,120
and l paid her with a cheque.

689
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:15,560
Next day it was all over.
But l faced up to it.

690
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:19,200
And later l was elected mayor
of Cincinnati.

691
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,800
That's the third largest city...
in Ohio.

692
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:28,120
There are only two things you need
to know about politics. One.

693
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:31,720
you'll never get anywhere unless
you have the courage to speak up

694
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,600
about what you know to be the truth.
And two.

695
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,680
some things
should always be paid for in cash.

696
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,760
My cards? Where are my cards?

697
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,720
- Jerry. Jerry.
- Go. Jerry. go.

698
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,240
Jerry. Jerry.

699
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:50,720
Jerry. Jerry. Jerry. Jerry.
Jerry. Jerry. Jerry. Jerry. Jerry.

700
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,720
- Hello.
- Oh. Jerry.

701
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,360
- How are you?
- Oh. Jerry.

702
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,520
- Jerry.
- Thank you and welcome back.

703
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,120
Thank you. And now our final guest.
Please say hello to Shawntel.

704
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,440
Fat bitch. Fat bitch.

705
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:16,640
- Shut up. Shut up. Sit down.
- Dumb ho.

706
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,320
- Shut up. Shut up. Sit down.
- Dumb ho.

707
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,520
Shawntel. it says here
that you want to be a pole dancer.

708
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,280
All my life

709
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:30,200
All my life.
l've been running after other people.

710
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,400
looking after them.
cleaning up their shit.

711
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:40,200
now l wanna find my dreams again.

712
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,600
- What? In a strip club?
- Good one.

713
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:44,920
Bug-eyed loser. strip slut.

714
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,840
Bug-eyed loser. strip slut.

715
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,000
- Talk to the ass.
- Strip slut.

716
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:54,000
- Talk to the ass.
- Strip slut.

717
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,000
- You fucking bitch.
- What did...?

718
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,480
Shawntel. l can see you have
a lot of natural talent.

719
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:04,080
l also see here that you're married.
So. what does your husband think?

720
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,640
l don't know. We don't talk.

721
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:12,880
Well. let's bring him on
and find out. Please welcome Chucky.

722
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:17,560
Hillbilly. Hillbilly.
Squeal like a piggy.

723
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:24,000
Hillbilly. Hillbilly.
Squeal like a piggy. Eeeeee!

724
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,600
Put your fucking clothes on.
you stupid bitch.

725
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:29,080
- Don't you touch me...
- You stupid bitch!

726
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:31,880
- ..or l'll kill you in your sleep.
- You stupid bitch.

727
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,480
- Cocksucker. Talk to the ass.
- You look ridiculous.

728
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:38,640
- Talk to the ass.
- You look ridiculous.

729
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:42,960
So, Chucky. l take it you're not too thrilled
with Shawntel's pole-dancing dreams?

730
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,520
She looks like a clown.

731
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:49,440
She looks like a slut.

732
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:54,000
He don't know shit.
He never saw me dance.

733
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,760
But he watches other women dance
every night

734
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,560
- with his buddies.
- Yeah. right.

735
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:01,360
Well. let's see her dance.
We have a pole.

736
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,880
We have some music. Let's go.

737
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,920
Dance. dance. dance. dance. dance.

738
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,920
dance. dance. dance. strip slut.

739
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,920
Shake that booty. strip slut.

740
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:17,000
- Shake that booty. strip slut.
- Bullshit!

741
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:26,400
l don't give a fuck no more

742
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:33,000

743

Things are going bad for me.

So. l just wanna dance.

748
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,800
Oh. l just wanna dance.

She's tired of laughing.
she's tired of crying.

757
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:52,920
She's tired of failing
and she's tired of all this trying.

758
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,920
She wants to do some living
cos she's done enough dying.

759
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,480
She just wants to dance.

00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,720

765
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:31,520
But we've got another guest

766
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,400
who's none too happy
with your choice of career.

767
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,360
Your mother Irene.

768
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,000
lt has no name.

769
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,800
lt is a whore.

770
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,360
- It has no name.
- Momma.

771
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,560
- It is a whore.
- Momma.

772
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:57,160
- It will burn.
- Momma.

773
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:00,160
- It will fry.
- Momma.

774
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:05,880
You're just a sack of misery.

775
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:10,920
Everything you touch turns to cancer.

776
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,040
Hope you die

777
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:19,080
slow with pain swimming
round your ugly ass.

778
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,640
your skanky sorry ass.

779
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:35,400
Welcome to the show. Irene.

780
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,680
l. erm. sense some hostility
towards your daughter.

781
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:49,840
Some are descended from angels.

782
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:57,120
Others are descended from apes.

783
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:03,200
Some are the result of romantic love.

784
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:09,800
Others the result of rapes.

785
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:15,600
Well. l wish she'd died at birth.

786
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:20,680
And l wish you'd died at birth. too.

787
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,320
Well. at least you agree
on one thing.

788
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,120
So. Chucky.
how do you fit into all of this?

789
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,280
lf she don't stop.
l'll find me another woman.

790
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,280
What you gonna do?
Buy her or drug her?

791
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:41,240
Gonna find me something to replace
her tainted. sagging old skin.

792
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:45,240
Good. Good.
l'm tired of your little dick flesh.

793
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,240
lt's so small l get more pleasure

794
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:53,560
from fucking myself
with my own clitoris.

795
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:56,960
All women are whores.

796
00:52:57,039 --> 00:52:59,480
Whores or sluts or prostitutes.

797
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:01,320
You don't know shit.

798
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,920
You don't know shit.

799
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:09,320
He's just an inbred
three-nippled cousin-fucker.

800
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,320
lnbreed three-nippled cousin-fucker.
Three-nippled cousin-fuck...

801
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,320
lnbreed three-nippled cousin-fucker.
Three-nippled cousin-fuck...

802
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,640
Three-nippled cousin-fuck...
Three-nippled cousin-fucker.

803
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,080
You're the innocent one here. Chucky.

804
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,360
l ain't easy. but l'm honest.

805
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,200
So. no secrets. then?

806
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,600
l like flowers more than people.

807
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:38,440
No. Jerry.

808
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:40,120
Well. that's strange. Chucky.

809
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:43,800
because we followed you around
with our secret camera. the Jerrycam.

810
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:48,280
And to be honest. we were
a little surprised by what we saw.

811
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:55,440
He came. he saw. he Jerrycam.

812
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:00,280
He came. he saw. he Jerrycam.

813
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,000
Vení, vídí, Jerrycam.

814
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:05,400
Vení, vídí, Jerrycam.

815
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,800
Adoremus Jerrycam.

816
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,320
Benedictus Jerry fucking...

817
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:17,520
Bring on the Klan.

818
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,760
No. not the fucking Klan.

819
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:26,880
Bring on the Klan.

820
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,040
No. not the fucking Klan.

821
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:33,600
No. not the fucking Klan.

822
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:40,320
Well. l guess it would be rude not
to. Please welcome the Ku Klux Klan.

823
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,120
Come on. boys.

824
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,400
Come on.

825
00:54:56,679 --> 00:54:59,440
Get your fuckin' hands off of me.
You fucked-up...

826
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:18,600
This is our Jerry Springer moment.

827
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:24,760
We don't want this moment to die.

828
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,640
So dip us in chocolate

829
00:55:29,719 --> 00:55:33,000
and throw us to the lesbians.

830
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:36,600
We don't want this moment to die.

831
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,200
Jews and blacks will go to hell.

832
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,320
New York Democrats as well.

833
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,080
We don't want this moment to

834
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,520
die.

835
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:06,080
Die.

836
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:07,760
Die.

837
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,680
Die.

838
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,320
Die.

839
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,760
Die.

840
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,040
Die.

841
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:16,560
Die.

842
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,200
Die.

843
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,320
Die.

844
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:27,520
Die.

845
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:31,040
We're running out of time.
My final thought.

846
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:38,840
Die.

847
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,000
l've been shot.

848
00:56:48,199 --> 00:56:52,000
l'm confused. Why would l get shot?

849
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:36,840
Wow! That's some medication
they got me on.

850
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,160
Jerry. Jerry.

851
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,520
Jerry. Jerry.

852
00:58:44,599 --> 00:58:47,760
Jerry. Jerry. Jerry. Jerry.

853
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:51,280
Jerry. Jerry. Jerry. Jerry.

854
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:54,680
- Jerry.
- Oh. Jerry.

855
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:59,240
Jerry.

856
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:05,400
Are you sure that's mine?
l never eat sweet corn.

857
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:14,320
Steve!

858
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,040
lt's good to see you.

859
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:20,480
Oh. you never let me down.
But you didn't take that bullet.

860
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:22,640
Just kidding.

861
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,280
Jerry. Jerry.

862
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,840
Jerry. Jerry.

863
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,120
Jerry. Jerry. Jerry. Jerry.

864
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:36,200
Jerry. Jerry. Jerry. Jerry.

865
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:39,920
- Jerry.
- Oh. Jerry.

866
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,640
Jerry.

867
00:59:43,719 --> 00:59:46,880
Steve. how cool is this?
Singing nurses.

868
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:52,120
a giant cigar
and. look. my own moving chair.

869
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,360
ls there a problem here?

870
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,280
Visitors.

871
01:00:11,559 --> 01:00:14,320
l hope they brought me some grapes.

872
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:25,440
We eat. excrete and watch TV.

873
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:30,800
And you are there for us. Jerry.

874
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:36,520
Jerry. can you understand?

875
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:42,520
We sit out in nowhereland.

876
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:47,160
wanting and yearning.

877
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:52,400
our bloated stomachs churning.

878
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,920
Eat. excrete and watch TV.

879
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,640
You are there for us. Jerry.

880
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:03,120
Steve. let me get this straight.

881
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:08,600
- You eat. excrete...
- And watch TV.

882
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:14,080
- But l am there for you?
- Jerry.

883
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:16,800
Steve. what exactly
are they saying here?

884
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,240
Jerry. you're so diflicult.

885
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:21,040
They're exactly saying
that they eat. excrete and watch TV

886
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,600
but you are there for them. Jerry.

887
01:01:24,679 --> 01:01:28,640
Oh. well. it's so nice of you guys to
take time out of your day to drop by.

888
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:32,040
l never knew l had so many friends.

889
01:01:32,119 --> 01:01:34,080
So. how's it going with you guys?

890
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:37,440
To be frank. pretty fucked.

891
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,720
Well. l can sympathise.

892
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,040
Ratings are low.
l've got a class-action suit pending.

893
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:47,480
Not to mention
this bullet-wound-in-the-chest thing.

894
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:49,480
Come and see.

895
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,640
Come and see what you have done

896
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:57,800
to me.

897
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:03,560
Steve. this sounds like lawyer talk.

898
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:05,960
Don't say anything.

899
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:10,160
One day you're 17.

900
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:12,400
17, 17.

901
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,560
Then just before you're 18. 18.

902
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:19,240
suddenly. suddenly.

903
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,920
you realise you're 56.

904
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:28,400
56? Well. you've got your whole life
ahead of you.

905
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,800
You're one good-looking woman.

906
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,520
He was handsome.

907
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,200
He was smart.

908
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:44,320
He betrayed every friend.

909
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,840
He broke every heart.

910
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,560
But one day he awoke

911
01:03:03,639 --> 01:03:07,920
to a scene that made him heave.

912
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,880
He'd been drugged up and fucked

913
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:15,280
by some sailors on leave.

914
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:19,680
Sailors on leave.

915
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,160
Hired and paid for by me.

916
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:30,080
You hired him a sailor. Shawntel?
Jeez. Chucky. you're a lucky guy.

917
01:03:30,159 --> 01:03:33,560
All my wife ever got me
was a reflexologist.

918
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,640
l came home from a titty bar.

919
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:42,720
where l'd spent all night.

920
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,560
She covers me in kerosene

921
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:49,720
and sets me fucking alight.

922
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,640
Fry!

923
01:03:51,719 --> 01:03:54,720
You set him on fire.
your husband of 15 years?

924
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,200
What was it. your anniversay?

925
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,600
Light of my life.

926
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:03,560
fire of my loins.

927
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:06,000
lover and laugher

928
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:09,440
and drinker and friend.

929
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:12,400
You stole my dreams.

930
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,680
You broke my jaw.

931
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,760
But you said you were Sorry

932
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:21,040
so l came back for more.

933
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:24,120
Stupid whore.

934
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:29,760
Came back for more.

935
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,960
Stupid whore.

936
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,880
Came back for more.

937
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,640
More. more.

938
01:04:41,719 --> 01:04:44,560
More. more.

939
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:47,640
More.

940
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:51,800
You know. if there's one thing that
really sickens me. it's violence.

941
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:57,520
Unless it's on TV. in
a carefully controlled environment.

942
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,120
When you fall in love.

943
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:04,560
it could last forever.

944
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:07,760
But usually it lasts about a month.

945
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,840
So l shot myself in the head

946
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,520
but l missed and ended up half dead.

947
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:17,200
Now there's a hole
where my brain used to be.

948
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,280
l'm hooked to a monitor.
l find it hard to pee.

949
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:23,280
l slur and l dribble
and l live off my drip feed

950
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:28,960
but l still can get a hard-on
if l jerk till l bleed.

951
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,280
Jerk

952
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,880
till l bleed.

953
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,080
Jerk till l bleed.

954
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:39,440
Jerk till l bleed.

955
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:41,400
At least something good
came out of it.

956
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
l made love

957
01:05:47,079 --> 01:05:50,840
to a dying man.

958
01:05:51,639 --> 01:05:55,280
l knew he was dying

959
01:05:55,360 --> 01:06:01,600
cos l was holding the pillow

960
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:04,160
over his face.

961
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:06,360
Steve. l think we'd better
get out of here.

962
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,320
There is only one cure

963
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,880
for unrequited love.

964
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:15,440
Chocolate and howling at the moon.

965
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:31,320
Eat. excrete and watch TV.

966
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:36,600
Eat. excrete and watch TV.

967
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:40,440
You know what? It's been great
catching up with you guys.

968
01:06:40,519 --> 01:06:43,240
And you've taken some knocks.

969
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:46,080
but you've gotta pick yourselves up.

970
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:49,960
Dust yourselves off
and have a magical day.

971
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,600
Behind you. Behind you.

972
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:55,840
Behind you.

973
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,080
Díes Irae.

974
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:01,880
Díes Irae.

975
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,120
What now?

976
01:07:04,599 --> 01:07:09,160
Dead woman walking.

977
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:16,640
Dead woman walking.

978
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:20,960
Baby Jane. you look like shit.
What happened to you?

979
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:25,080
Momma gave me smack on the asshole.

980
01:07:25,719 --> 01:07:28,920
Momma gave me smack on the head.

981
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,960
But Momma gave me smack
with a monkey wrench

982
01:07:34,039 --> 01:07:38,480
and now l am dead.

983
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:54,120
You know. Steve.

984
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:58,320
a person with less broadcasting
experience might feel responsible.

985
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:05,480
Your dreams take place in Manhattan.

986
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:12,720
Ours take place in Minnesota.

987
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:18,920
Your dreams are driven in a Bentley.

988
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:25,400
Ours in a rusty Skoda.

989
01:08:26,199 --> 01:08:28,440
Big dreams

990
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,120
and small dreams.

991
01:08:32,199 --> 01:08:35,240
like all dreams

992
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:38,840
just stay dreams.

993
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,960
l guess this must be
what guilt feels like.

994
01:08:52,039 --> 01:08:58,960
That was my Jerry Springer moment.

995
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:04,560
l didn't want that moment

996
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:09,520
to die.

997
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:14,120
Seen all over the planet

998
01:09:14,199 --> 01:09:18,560
on worldwide TV.

999
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,880
except developing countries

1000
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:24,160
and Germany.

1001
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,400
You know, l'll never understand why they
didn't pick the show up in Germany.

1002
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:29,920
But don't get me started.

1003
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:33,480
Oh. how my heart

1004
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,920
aches for love.

1005
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,400
Aches for love.

1006
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:40,840
Oh. how my heart

1007
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,120
aches for love.

1008
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:45,840
Aches for love.

1009
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:50,680
- Oh. how my heart
- Oh. how my heart

1010
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:55,480
- Oh. how my heart
- Oh. how my heart

1011
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,640
Aches.

1012
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:00,000
Aches.

1013
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:05,840
Aches.

1014
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:14,200
Alright. let's clear up
a basic misunderstanding right now.

1015
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:17,560
You all wanted to come on the show.

1016
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:21,800
You all had your 15 seconds of fame.

1017
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:26,160
You all got to stay
in a three-star hotel.

1018
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:29,520
You all got an expenses-paid trip.

1019
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,720
Minus minibar bills, Chucky,
to Chicago.

1020
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,880
And. remember. that's Chicago.
the Windy City.

1021
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,120
The city of. of...

1022
01:10:40,279 --> 01:10:41,480
wind.

1023
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:46,200
You all knew the risks.
You signed the disclaimer.

1024
01:10:46,279 --> 01:10:49,920
So stop breaking my balls
and get out of my...

1025
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,120
Steve. where the fuck are we?

1026
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,720
Jerry. Jerry.

1027
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,720
You have been chosen.

1028
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,720
Chosen?

1029
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,960
ls that a good thing?
Could you be a little more specific?

1030
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,640
Chosen.

1031
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:13,920
- Chosen.
- Chosen for what?

1032
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,160
Will you people stop fucking with me?

1033
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:20,720
Lo! He comes.

1034
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,200
Lo! He comes.

1035
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:38,120
Oh. great! It's that loser
warm-up guy. Jonathan Wierus.

1036
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:40,720
Wrong. Him am the devil.

1037
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,040
- Ooh. yes. l'm evil.
- Him am not good.

1038
01:11:44,119 --> 01:11:45,760
The opposite. in fact.

1039
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,920
ln fact. him a total cunt.

1040
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,800
One way of putting it.

1041
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:54,720
Him act as total cunt should.
What a cunt.

1042
01:11:55,359 --> 01:11:56,880
What a cunt.

1043
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:02,560
What a cunting. cunting.
cunting. cunting cunt.

1044
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,240
- You're telling me you're the devil?
- Yes.

1045
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:19,160
lt takes more than a little red suit
to be the devil.

1046
01:12:19,239 --> 01:12:21,680
Steve. throw this psycho out of here.

1047
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:24,120
l don't think so.

1048
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:27,800
N-N-N-N-N...

1049
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,040
- Steve !
- Naughty.

1050
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:34,320
- N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Naughty.
- Steve. Steve!

1051
01:12:36,439 --> 01:12:37,920
OK. OK. hang on. hang on.

1052
01:12:40,119 --> 01:12:43,680
So maybe l was a little hasty
with that firing thing.

1053
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:49,560
That is of no concern.

1054
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:54,680
Though it was not what l deserved.

1055
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:59,400
l simply come to take you down

1056
01:12:59,479 --> 01:13:02,000
to hell where you will...

1057
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:04,000
Serve.

1058
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:07,640
Whoa. whoa. whoa! Time out!
Let's rewind this a little.

1059
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:09,720
Now. l don't want to serve in hell.

1060
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:12,920
At this stage in my career.
that would be a sideways move.

1061
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:19,680
Come. Jerry. gird your loins.
for we must journey south of heaven.

1062
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:24,160
Step into this elevator and set
a course for the basement level.

1063
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:28,760
Fall with me.

1064
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:33,120
- Fall with him.
- l've got a table booked at The Ivy.

1065
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:35,120
lf you're proud and you walk tall.

1066
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:37,560
you only got further to fall.

1067
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:42,000
Like the apple on the tree.
you'll soon succumb to gravity.

1068
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:45,880
Fall with me.

1069
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:49,760
Fall with him.

1070
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,720
Fall. fall. fall. fall. fall. fall.

1071
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,680
Fall. fall. fall. fall. fall. fall.

1072
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:57,640
Doesn't matter what you are.
prince or pauper. king or clown.

1073
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,360
there is no greater act of love

1074
01:14:00,439 --> 01:14:02,440
than going down.

1075
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:06,200
- Going down with me.
- Steve!

1076
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:11,320
- Going down with him.
- l can't go to hell. l'm Jewish.

1077
01:14:11,399 --> 01:14:13,400
Surrender your mortal soul.

1078
01:14:13,479 --> 01:14:15,480
Let life swallow you up whole.

1079
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:17,920
Wipe off that suspicious frown.

1080
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,280
cos. baby. we all gotta go down.

1081
01:14:22,359 --> 01:14:24,280
- The white man.
- Gotta go down.

1082
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:26,600
- The black man.
- Gotta go down.

1083
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,960
The red man. green man.
pink man. beige man.

1084
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:30,640
Gotta go. gotta go d-d-down.
d-d-down.

1085
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:31,760
- The tax man.
- Down.

1086
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:32,960
- The gas man.
- Down.

1087
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:34,000
- The VAT man.
- Down.

1088
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:35,320
- The weatherman.
- Down.

1089
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:36,520
- The snowman.
- Down.

1090
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:37,680
- The doorman.
- Down.

1091
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:38,920
- The woman man.
- Down.

1092
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,320
Down. down.

1093
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:41,920
Down. down.

1094
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,720
Down. down.

1095
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,480
Down. down.

1096
01:14:48,199 --> 01:14:51,200
Wait.

1097
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:57,080
Prince of Darkness.

1098
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:01,720
punish him not.

1099
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:08,840
Jerry is not to blame.

1100
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:14,400
With or without Jerry's show.

1101
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:21,000
we'd all end up the same.

1102
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,400
Men and women. black and white.

1103
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:30,440
transsexual girls and boys.

1104
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:34,680
the burned and crippled.

1105
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:38,720
blind. the maimed.

1106
01:15:40,039 --> 01:15:43,080
distorted.

1107
01:15:43,159 --> 01:15:45,600
destroyed.

1108
01:15:46,319 --> 01:15:49,320
For society

1109
01:15:49,399 --> 01:15:59,280
has an ugly face.

1110
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,920
Contorted.

1111
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,280
smeared with shit.

1112
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,240
Jerry did not make it so.

1113
01:16:15,319 --> 01:16:22,280
He merely holds a mirror to it.

1114
01:16:23,039 --> 01:16:25,720
That's right. what she said there.

1115
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,000
l do the mirror thing.

1116
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:29,600
Tell him again. Tell him again.

1117
01:16:31,159 --> 01:16:33,440
- The Wicker Man.
- Gotta go down.

1118
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,600
- Elephant Man.
- Gotta go down.

1119
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,720
- The Piltdown Man.
- Gotta go down.

1120
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:39,920
- The blah-blah man.
- Gotta go down.

1121
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,720
Blah. blah. blah. blah.

1122
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,680
- Blah.
- Blah. blah-blah. blah-blah. blah.

1123
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:48,040
- Blah. blah-blah. blah-blah. blah.
- Blah. blah.

1124
01:16:48,119 --> 01:16:50,320
The man with hair
and the man with none.

1125
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:52,560
the man with the knife
and the man with the gun.

1126
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,520
the man on the moon
and the man on the farm.

1127
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,960
the man with a needle
stuck in his arm.

1128
01:16:57,039 --> 01:16:59,120
the man on the crapper
with voices in his head.

1129
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:01,320
the man who wishes
evey other man was dead.

1130
01:17:01,399 --> 01:17:03,440
the man with ten kids
and a loving wife.

1131
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,480
the man who has nothing
to show for his life.

1132
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:08,440
Every last motherfucker
should go down.

1133
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,520
Every last motherfucker
should go down.

1134
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,800
Every last motherfucker
should go down.

1135
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,080
- Down.
- Wait a minute.

1136
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,160
l'm confused here.

1137
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:25,320
Why are you dragging me down to hell?
l don't deserve this.

1138
01:17:25,399 --> 01:17:28,120
l'm not a bad guy.
l just got lucky. that's all.

1139
01:17:28,199 --> 01:17:31,800
l mean. Jesus. is that a sin?

1140
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,800
- No.
- You see? They agree.

1141
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,920
l take you to hell

1142
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,560
to solve a problem

1143
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,960
that's been chapping my ass

1144
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:48,360
since the dawn of time.

1145
01:17:48,439 --> 01:17:52,400
Since the dawn of time.

1146
01:17:52,479 --> 01:17:54,640
You've got the wrong guy.

1147
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,360
l don't solve problems.

1148
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:01,120
l just televise them.
Now. what do you want from me?

1149
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:04,960
l want you to do a show for me.

1150
01:18:06,359 --> 01:18:09,640
Wait, let me get this straight.
You want me to do a show for you.

1151
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:12,040
the devil. in hell?

1152
01:18:14,199 --> 01:18:18,800
Look. l'm under exclusive contract
to USA Studios.

1153
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,800
They've got a whole
building full of lawyers.

1154
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,640
You'd have to talk to the head of
the company and he's not here right now.

1155
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:27,320
Yes. he is. Yes. he is.

1156
01:18:27,399 --> 01:18:28,880
Show business.

1157
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,840
Razzle-dazzle. Razzle-dazzle.
Show business.

1158
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,920
Do your greatest show for me.
Turn chaos into harmony.

1159
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:43,080
- And if l refuse?
- For all eternity.

1160
01:18:44,439 --> 01:18:46,200
you will be. you will be...

1161
01:18:46,279 --> 01:18:48,360
Fried and flambéed.

1162
01:18:48,439 --> 01:18:50,560
Baked and sautéed.

1163
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,800
- Steamed and stewed.
- Then.

1164
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,800
- Barbecued
- Then.

1165
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,600
- Grilled and roasted.
- Then.

1166
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,320
Lightly toasted.

1167
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:01,120
- Then. then. then. then.
- Then. what?

1168
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:03,440
Fucked up the ass

1169
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:06,280
with barbed wire.

1170
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,960
OK. so that's the downside.

1171
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:17,480
So. what's the upside if l succeed
in this? What's in it for me?

1172
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:20,440
Not getting ass-fucked

1173
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,840
with barbed wire.

1174
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,440
So. what are the hours?

1175
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:35,320
Jerry is going to hell.

1176
01:19:35,399 --> 01:19:37,200
- No. no. no. no. no.
- Hot enough for ya?

1177
01:19:37,279 --> 01:19:38,960
Hot enough for ya?

1178
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:41,440
- Jerry's going...
- No!

1179
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,760
..to hell.

1180
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,400
Hell.

1181
01:19:45,479 --> 01:19:52,080
Hell.

1182
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:58,480
Hell.

1183
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,080
Hot enough for ya?

1184
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:01,800
Hot enough for ya?

1185
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,280
Hot enough for ya?

1186
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:05,360
Hot enough for ya?

1187
01:20:39,079 --> 01:20:42,520
Demons and devils.

1188
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:45,720
incubi and succubi

1189
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:50,800
and princes and princesses of hell.

1190
01:20:52,199 --> 01:20:57,160
welcome for one night only

1191
01:20:57,239 --> 01:21:03,800
or perhaps for all eternity.

1192
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:08,560
He's bigger than the planet earth.

1193
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,960
Bigger than the biggest big.

1194
01:21:12,039 --> 01:21:14,960
Biggie. biggie. biggie. big.

1195
01:21:15,039 --> 01:21:17,640
Biggie. biggie. biggie. biggie. big.

1196
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:23,320
- Lo! He comes.
- Jerry. Jerry. Jerry. Jerry.

1197
01:21:23,399 --> 01:21:28,600
- Lo! He comes.
- Jerry. Jerry. Jerry. Jerry.

1198
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,720
Laudamus Jerry.

1199
01:21:35,319 --> 01:21:37,520
- Te adoremus.
- Biggie. biggie. big.

1200
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,320
Laudamus Jerry.

1201
01:21:41,399 --> 01:21:44,680
- Te adoremus.
- Biggie. biggie. big.

1202
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:52,960
Big.

1203
01:22:01,399 --> 01:22:05,600
Steve. this all seems
strangely familiar.

1204
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,120
Baby Jane.

1205
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:18,640
- So. what am l supposed to do?
- Just say the cards.

1206
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:32,080
Hello and welcome to a very special
edition of The Jerry Sprínger Show.

1207
01:22:33,319 --> 01:22:36,240
That's me. That's my show.

1208
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:44,200
You know. from time immemorial.
heaven and hell have been at war.

1209
01:22:47,399 --> 01:22:51,200
But is there a way of reconciling
the irreconcilable

1210
01:22:51,279 --> 01:22:55,200
and giving both parties some sense
of closure and a chance to move on?

1211
01:22:55,279 --> 01:22:58,000
Hey. wait a minute.
Look. l don't do. never have done

1212
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:01,040
and never will do
conflict resolution.

1213
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:04,120
- Then you will fy.
- Please welcome my first guest.

1214
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:10,160
the Prince of Darkness. Satan.

1215
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:13,360
- Satan. Satan.
- Go. Satan. go.

1216
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:14,800
Satan. Satan.

1217
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,120
Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan.

1218
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:18,800
Satan. Satan. Sa...

1219
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:25,880
Once in happy realms of light.

1220
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:30,920
l was transcendental.

1221
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,120
golden

1222
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:38,240
and bright.

1223
01:23:40,399 --> 01:23:42,640
Bright.

1224
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:49,960
But l rebelled and was cast down.

1225
01:23:50,039 --> 01:23:54,880
forced to surrender

1226
01:23:54,960 --> 01:24:01,720
my celestial crown.

1227
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,680
Oh.

1228
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,120
My Crown.

1229
01:24:06,199 --> 01:24:08,320
Oh.

1230
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:12,920
Then God hurled me from the skies.

1231
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,720
not merciful enough

1232
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,640
to let

1233
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:25,840
me die.

1234
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:30,240
Let me die.

1235
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,440
Confounded.

1236
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,440
immortal l.

1237
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:39,560
Paradise

1238
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:45,480
lost

1239
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:50,000
and pain eternal.

1240
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:53,680
Pain eternal.

1241
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:56,240
You seem upset.

1242
01:24:56,319 --> 01:24:59,000
So. what exactly do you want?

1243
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:01,920
l want it to be just like old times.

1244
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,120
with Baby Jesus by my side.

1245
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:06,600
l want my old wings back. as well.

1246
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:08,840
Wanna get out of this dump
called hell.

1247
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:11,480
But first and most importantly.

1248
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:15,080
l want a fucking apology.

1249
01:25:15,159 --> 01:25:17,520
- Apology.
- An apology?

1250
01:25:18,359 --> 01:25:21,280
You instigated a coup d'état
against God in heaven.

1251
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:27,000
You went down to earth and you led
mankind into a whole world of shit.

1252
01:25:27,079 --> 01:25:30,760
And you want me to get
the good guys to apologise to you?

1253
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:32,560
Are you out of your mind?

1254
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:35,080
How in hell am l supposed to do that?

1255
01:25:35,159 --> 01:25:36,680
Just read the cards.

1256
01:25:41,319 --> 01:25:43,560
This is your handwriting. l suppose.

1257
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:48,920
Let's see if we can get an apology
from my next guest.

1258
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,720
the hypocrite son
of the fascist tyrant on high.

1259
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,560
Jesus of Nazareth.

1260
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:56,920
Jesus. Jesus. what the fuck?

1261
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,240
Coming here. pushing his luck.

1262
01:25:59,319 --> 01:26:01,520
Make him wear a thorny crown.

1263
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:05,880
Grab his pants and pull them down.

1264
01:26:06,399 --> 01:26:09,400
Old friend.

1265
01:26:09,479 --> 01:26:12,720
old foe.

1266
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:20,600
l missed you.

1267
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:25,880
Jesus. what a beautiful moment.

1268
01:26:27,399 --> 01:26:29,160
Jesus.

1269
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,800
Satan has something
he wants to say to you.

1270
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:36,840
Go ahead. Satan.

1271
01:26:40,119 --> 01:26:49,120
Fu...

1272
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:50,720

you.

1315
01:28:54,039 --> 01:28:56,920
Talk to the

1316
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,600
stigmata.

1317
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:07,840
Always has to have the last word.

1318
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,680
That's right.

1319
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,640
- Apologise.
- Son of Man.

1320
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:16,280
- Apologise.
- Son of Man.

1321
01:29:16,359 --> 01:29:18,400
lt ain't gonna happen.
Sit down on your ass.

1322
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:20,680
lt ain't gonna happen.
Sit down on your ass.

1323
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:24,560
Jesus. Jesus. Jesus!
Give me a second.

1324
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:30,000
Satan. what are you doing here?
You're making the situation worse.

1325
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,160
Jesus has flown a long way
to be here today.

1326
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:37,160
This is not his neighbourhood.

1327
01:29:37,239 --> 01:29:39,800
Show him a little courtesy.

1328
01:29:42,399 --> 01:29:44,800
So he turned some water into wine.

1329
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:45,800
Ooh!

1330
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,320
So he walked across
the frickin' seas.

1331
01:29:48,399 --> 01:29:49,400
Ooh!

1332
01:29:49,479 --> 01:29:52,240
So you got yourself crucified.

1333
01:29:52,319 --> 01:29:55,000
Here's a little biscuit from me.

1334
01:29:55,079 --> 01:29:59,600
l am Jesus.

1335
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:02,240
Son of Man.

1336
01:30:02,319 --> 01:30:04,920
son of Mary.

1337
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,280
son of God.

1338
01:30:10,279 --> 01:30:12,240
So do not.

1339
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:14,040
do not.

1340
01:30:14,119 --> 01:30:17,120
do not fuck with me!

1341
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,520
Ooh. scared.

1342
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:26,480
l do not want your biscuit.

1343
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:29,080
l want your love

1344
01:30:29,159 --> 01:30:32,080
and your respect.

1345
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,960
For l am love

1346
01:30:38,039 --> 01:30:41,760
and l love all mankind.

1347
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:45,280
- Jesus is gay.
- Pathetic!

1348
01:30:45,359 --> 01:30:47,120
- Jesus is gay.
- Gimme a break!

1349
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:49,200
G-A-Y. gay! G-A-Y. gay!

1350
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,600
Actually.

1351
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,480
l am a bit gay.

1352
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:01,640
G-A-Y. gay! G-A-Y. gay!

1353
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:04,600
- G-A-Y. gay! G-A-Y. gay!
- Satan.

1354
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:07,440
Satan.

1355
01:31:08,439 --> 01:31:11,840
between you and me.
if you want to achieve anything here.

1356
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:15,480
you and your people are going
to have to work with me on this.

1357
01:31:16,119 --> 01:31:17,720
Just read the cards.

1358
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,480
Oh. Jesus!

1359
01:31:23,159 --> 01:31:26,360
You call yourself Jesus
but you are not worthy of the name.

1360
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:28,840
- Who wrote this shit?
- The cards.

1361
01:31:31,399 --> 01:31:35,400
Let's meet two other guests who are
also after an apology from Jesus.

1362
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:39,040
He was fashioned
from a lump of clay.

1363
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:42,800
And she showed kindness to a snake.

1364
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:46,760
The mother and father of humanity.
Adam and Eve.

1365
01:31:56,079 --> 01:31:58,840
Put your fucking clothes on.
you stupid bitch.

1366
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:01,280
- Don't you touch me...
- You stupid bitch!

1367
01:32:01,359 --> 01:32:04,360
- ..or l'll kill you in your sleep.
- You stupid bitch.

1368
01:32:04,439 --> 01:32:07,680
- Cocksucker. Talk to the ass.
- You look ridiculous.

1369
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:10,880
- Talk to the ass.
- She looks ridiculous.

1370
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,360
Welcome to the show.

1371
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:17,000
How's the relationship going?

1372
01:32:17,079 --> 01:32:20,160
All women are whores.

1373
01:32:20,239 --> 01:32:23,200
Whores or sluts or prostitutes.

1374
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:24,640
He don't know shit.

1375
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:26,120
He don't know shit.

1376
01:32:26,199 --> 01:32:28,920
He's just a piece of...

1377
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,640
- Shut it. Slut!
- Shut it. Gimp!

1378
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:32,280
Whatever.

1379
01:32:32,359 --> 01:32:35,720
Putting aside your domestic
grievances for just a moment.

1380
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:39,440
Eve. what is it
you want to say to Jesus?

1381
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:44,760
- For one little apple...
- Don't talk to me. Talk to Jesus.

1382
01:32:46,319 --> 01:32:52,040
For one little apple
on a little tree.

1383
01:32:52,119 --> 01:32:55,520
we get a life of grief and misey.

1384
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:59,560
She made me do it.
made me do it.

1385
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:02,960
You had your chance and you blew it.

1386
01:33:03,039 --> 01:33:05,400
Forbidden fruit.

1387
01:33:05,479 --> 01:33:07,440
Forbidden fruit.

1388
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:10,040
But vegetables allowed.

1389
01:33:10,119 --> 01:33:12,640
- God's plan.
- One little apple.

1390
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:15,240
- God's plan.
- Just a little apple.

1391
01:33:15,319 --> 01:33:18,760
- She made me do it. made me do it.
- God's plan. God's plan.

1392
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:22,320
Just a little apple.
One little apple.

1393
01:33:22,399 --> 01:33:24,720
- Just a little apple.
- Blame it on the snake. man.

1394
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,160
One little apple.

1395
01:33:27,239 --> 01:33:29,920
- Just a little apple.
- God's plan.

1396
01:33:38,319 --> 01:33:39,840
What the fuck? What the fuck?

1397
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:42,320
What the fucking. fucking fuck?

1398
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:47,000
That's just great. Jesus.
You hit a woman.

1399
01:33:47,079 --> 01:33:49,920
l think you should
apologise to her.

1400
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:55,640
You followed the way

1401
01:33:55,720 --> 01:34:00,640
of ambition and vanity.

1402
01:34:01,159 --> 01:34:04,040
But it was me

1403
01:34:04,119 --> 01:34:09,360
who had to redeem humanity.

1404
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,280
You're weeping now

1405
01:34:13,359 --> 01:34:19,040
but you didn't give a toss

1406
01:34:19,119 --> 01:34:23,000
when l was crying out.

1407
01:34:23,079 --> 01:34:25,320
crying out.

1408
01:34:25,399 --> 01:34:31,240
crying out on the cross.

1409
01:34:31,319 --> 01:34:35,760
On the cross.

1410
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:40,680
- On the cross.
- Always with the crucifixion.

1411
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:42,680
Whatever!

1412
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:46,680
That was 2,000 years ago.

1413
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:51,480
lnstead of banging on about it.

1414
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:55,560
why don't you get over it

1415
01:34:55,640 --> 01:35:00,040
and give us all a fucking break?

1416
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,960
Enough of this shit. Get on with it.

1417
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:06,560
l'm trying to get on with it.
l'm trying to get you your apology.

1418
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:09,840
but this is an impossible situation.

1419
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,640
Fucked up the ass

1420
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:13,880
with barbed wire.

1421
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,320
l'm not going to read this.
There's no point.

1422
01:35:17,399 --> 01:35:19,720
Barbed wire.

1423
01:35:21,399 --> 01:35:23,600
Well. Satan.
we've got a surprise guest

1424
01:35:26,399 --> 01:35:28,720
who wants to give
her version of events.

1425
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:32,920
Please welcome the teenage mother
of Jesus. Mary.

1426
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,960
Raped by an angel.

1427
01:35:36,039 --> 01:35:38,000
Raped by an angel.

1428
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:40,160
Raped by an angel.

1429
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:42,440
Raped by God.

1430
01:36:34,399 --> 01:36:36,680
What exactly are you saying here?

1431
01:36:38,199 --> 01:36:40,520
Where were you when l was on my own?

1432
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:43,120
Where were you
when they rolled the stone?

1433
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:45,280
Where were you
when l was getting old?

1434
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:49,560
Where were you
when l was sick and bald?

1435
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:52,800
Where? Where?

1436
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:56,000
Where were you?

1437
01:36:56,079 --> 01:36:59,200
Where? Where?

1438
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:03,400
- Where were you?
- Jesus wasn't there. He didn't care.

1439
01:37:03,479 --> 01:37:05,880
Where were you
when the children cried?

1440
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:08,240
Where were you
when the children died?

1441
01:37:08,319 --> 01:37:10,640
Where were you when l was crucified?

1442
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:14,680
Where were you
when they pierced my side?

1443
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:16,400
Where?

1444
01:37:16,479 --> 01:37:18,160
Where?

1445
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:21,720
- Where were you?
- Wasn't there. Didn't care.

1446
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,960
Where? Where?

1447
01:37:24,039 --> 01:37:29,560
Where were you?

1448
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:33,360
Doesn't know. Didn't show.
Never there. Doesn't care!

1449
01:37:33,439 --> 01:37:36,320
Where were you when he got fleas?

1450
01:37:36,399 --> 01:37:39,400
Where were you when he lost his keys?

1451
01:37:39,479 --> 01:37:42,200
Where were you
when her pants don't fit?

1452
01:37:42,279 --> 01:37:45,800
Where were you when the condom split?

1453
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:52,200
- Is it me?
- When the condom split.

1454
01:37:54,039 --> 01:37:57,200
- Somebody help me out here.
- When the condom split.

1455
01:37:57,279 --> 01:37:59,880
You really gotta help me out.
l don't know what to do.

1456
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:02,880
We're tired of laughing

1457
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:05,480
and we're tired of crying.

1458
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:07,480
We're tired of failing.

1459
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:10,400
- We're tired of all this trying.
- l don't know what to do.

1460
01:38:10,479 --> 01:38:12,560
We wanna do some living

1461
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:15,040
cos we've done enough dying.

1462
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:18,120
So come on. Jerry Springer.

1463
01:38:18,199 --> 01:38:22,000
- and just read the fucking cards.
- l don't have any cards.

1464
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:27,480
Cards.

1465
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:30,200
Just read the fucking cards.

1466
01:38:30,279 --> 01:38:32,680
Just read the fucking cards.

1467
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:36,720
- l don't have any more cards!
- Well. neither do l.

1468
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,480
l can't get you your apologies.

1469
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:44,920
This isn't fair. It's a set-up!

1470
01:38:46,399 --> 01:38:49,960
There's no way of solving this.
short of a miracle.

1471
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:00,440
Behold God!

1472
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:03,160
We are beholding him.

1473
01:39:03,239 --> 01:39:05,360
Behold God!

1474
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:07,360
We are beholding him.

1475
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:09,840
- Then. behold him more!
- What?

1476
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:12,720
- Behold him more!
- God?

1477
01:39:13,479 --> 01:39:16,880
Oh. thank God.
Thank God. you're here.

1478
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:30,800
lt ain't easy being me.

1479
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:37,880
lt so ain't easy being me.

1480
01:39:39,239 --> 01:39:45,480
Billions of voices
making all the wrong choices.

1481
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:50,360
then turning round and blaming me.

1482
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,920
l tell ya.

1483
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:58,840
it ain't easy being me.

1484
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:05,720
- It ain't easy being him.
- It ain't.

1485
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:11,400
- It so ain't easy being him.
- It ain't.

1486
01:40:12,399 --> 01:40:20,720
Billions of voices
making all the wrong choices.

1487
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:27,880
lt...

1488
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:37,320
lt ain't easy being me.

1489
01:40:46,159 --> 01:40:48,440
God.

1490
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:52,000
You weren't on Satan's list
of guests. What are you doing here?

1491
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:53,440
What do you want?

1492
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,520
Sit in heaven beside me.

1493
01:40:57,239 --> 01:41:00,040
Hold my hand and guide me.

1494
01:41:00,119 --> 01:41:05,000
Cos it ain't easy being me.

1495
01:41:05,079 --> 01:41:09,040
ln fact. it's diflicult.

1496
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:14,000
Sit in heaven beside you.
hold your hand and guide you?

1497
01:41:14,079 --> 01:41:16,640
Well. that's a no-brainer!

1498
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:19,360
l'm your man. And. Satan.

1499
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:25,240
You can take that barbed wire
and stick it up your own ass.

1500
01:41:25,319 --> 01:41:28,440
Back into your sky.

1501
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:31,560
- Jerry stays here to fry.
- No. no. no. no.

1502
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:34,520
- Fry!
- He's mine.

1503
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:37,240
- l don't think so. l don't think so.
- He's mine.

1504
01:41:37,319 --> 01:41:39,000
He's mine. l don't think so.

1505
01:41:39,079 --> 01:41:40,240
- He's mine. He's mine.
- He's mine. He's mine.

1506
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:42,120
- l don't think so. l don't think so.
- l don't think so. l don't think so.

1507
01:41:42,199 --> 01:41:44,920
l don't think so.

1508
01:41:57,079 --> 01:41:58,320
What the fuck?

1509
01:42:04,079 --> 01:42:06,400
- Fry!
- Save us. Jerry. Save us. Jerry.

1510
01:42:06,479 --> 01:42:09,040
- Fry!
- Steve. do something.

1511
01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:14,320
Seize the day and act. Jerry.

1512
01:42:14,399 --> 01:42:17,040
Burn. Jerry. Burn. Jerry.
Jerry. burn.

1513
01:42:17,119 --> 01:42:20,080
Anybody. help!

1514
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:23,400
Burn. Jerry. Burn. Jerry.

1515
01:42:23,479 --> 01:42:26,720
Burn. Jerry. Burn. Jerry.

1516
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:29,800
Burn. Jerry. Burn. Jerry.

1517
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:32,600
Jerry's gonna fry. Jerry's gonna fry.

1518
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:33,840
Wait! Wait!

1519
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:37,640
At least give me one chance
to sort this out.

1520
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:43,880
l have a dream.

1521
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,320
l have a dream where eveyone here
turns to their neighbour

1522
01:42:54,479 --> 01:42:57,560
and shakes them by the hand and says.

1523
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,800
''You know.
you're not such a bad guy.''

1524
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:05,720
''Why don't you come on over?
My wife's making meat loaf.''

1525
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:09,000
- Seize the day.
- Burn. Jerry. Burn. Jerry.

1526
01:43:09,079 --> 01:43:13,200
Wait. wait! At least give me
a second chance to sort this out.

1527
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:20,760
Four score and seven years ago.

1528
01:43:24,399 --> 01:43:27,320
our forefathers brought forth
on this continent

1529
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:33,280
a new nation conceived in liberty.

1530
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:37,560
conceived in freedom

1531
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,280
and in...

1532
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:46,800
other abstract concepts.

1533
01:43:47,399 --> 01:43:49,320
like smell. l-l...

1534
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:54,040
- Burn. Jerry.
- Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.

1535
01:43:54,119 --> 01:43:56,760
At least give me a third chance
to sort this out.

1536
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:03,200
There's just one thing l want to say
to eveyone here today.

1537
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:09,360
Please.

1538
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,920
Please don't kill me. Please.

1539
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,880
- Seize the day.
- Burn. Jerry. Burn. Jerry.

1540
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:23,800
What the heck! Go ahead and burn me
if it makes you happy. See if l care.

1541
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:28,240
You're never gonna agree
on eveything.

1542
01:44:29,079 --> 01:44:30,720
And what's so bad about that?

1543
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:34,800
Satan. you're never gonna get
your apologies.

1544
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:39,600
And. God. you just don't get
a shoulder to cry on.

1545
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,200
And. Jesus.

1546
01:44:43,239 --> 01:44:46,840
Grow up. for Christ's sake.
and put some fucking clothes on.

1547
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:54,400
Haven't you people
heard of yin and yang.

1548
01:44:56,079 --> 01:44:57,880
love and hate.

1549
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:00,360
attraction and repulsion?

1550
01:45:00,439 --> 01:45:03,880
lt's the human condition
we're talking about here.

1551
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:06,520
Energy is pure delight.

1552
01:45:07,319 --> 01:45:10,600
Nothing is wrong
and nothing is right.

1553
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:13,680
And everything that lives is holy.

1554
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,400
And. in conclusion.

1555
01:45:20,319 --> 01:45:21,800
fuck you.

1556
01:45:23,199 --> 01:45:24,800
Fuck you all!

1557
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:33,240
Eveything that lives

1558
01:45:33,319 --> 01:45:37,600
is holy.

1559
01:45:38,199 --> 01:45:41,200
Energy

1560
01:45:41,279 --> 01:45:46,040
is delight.

1561
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:50,400
We stand together.

1562
01:45:50,479 --> 01:45:53,480
joined.

1563
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:58,000
joined in might.

1564
01:45:58,079 --> 01:46:01,760
Energy is pure delight.

1565
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:05,400
Nothing is wrong
and nothing is right.

1566
01:46:05,479 --> 01:46:08,960
Energy is pure delight.

1567
01:46:09,039 --> 01:46:12,560
Nothing is wrong
and nothing is right.

1568
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:18,760
Let poets through the ages tell

1569
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:23,080
how Springer united

1570
01:46:23,159 --> 01:46:28,840
heaven and hell.

1571
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:30,640
What did l say?

1572
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:36,840
This is his Jerry Springer moment.

1573
01:46:38,319 --> 01:46:43,120
Him don't want him moment to die.

1574
01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:44,680
Die. die. die. die.

1575
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:48,080
So dip him in chocolate

1576
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:51,240
and throw him to the lesbians.

1577
01:46:51,319 --> 01:46:58,200
Him don't want him moment to die.

1578
01:46:58,279 --> 01:47:03,920
This is his Jerry Springer moment.

1579
01:47:06,119 --> 01:47:12,840
Him don't want him moment to die.

1580
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:16,400
So dip him in chocolate

1581
01:47:16,479 --> 01:47:20,800
and throw him to the lesbians.

1582
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:24,160
Him don't want him moment

1583
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:26,800
Him don't want him moment

1584
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,120
Him don't want him

1585
01:47:28,199 --> 01:47:29,400
Him don't want him

1586
01:47:29,479 --> 01:47:32,000
Him don't. him don't.
him don't. him don't...

1587
01:47:45,399 --> 01:47:47,120
Jerry.

1588
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:49,400
it is finished.

1589
01:47:50,039 --> 01:47:51,360
Excuse me?

1590
01:47:51,439 --> 01:47:55,520
You're free.

1591
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:58,120
Say what?

1592
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:06,800
Free.

1593
01:48:10,319 --> 01:48:11,720
You know what. Baby Jane?

1594
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:17,680
l like it here in hell.
l think l'm gonna stay.

1595
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:19,680
l'm not confused here.

1596
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:23,560
For the first time. l'm not confused
about anything any more.

1597
01:48:24,399 --> 01:48:27,000
Goodbye.

1598
01:48:27,079 --> 01:48:30,320
Jerry.

1599
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:51,080
Jerry eleíson.

1600
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:58,960
Jerry eleíson.

1601
01:48:59,399 --> 01:49:03,280
Jerry eleíson.

1602
01:49:03,359 --> 01:49:06,720
Jerry eleíson.

1603
01:49:07,279 --> 01:49:13,880
Eleíson.

1604
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:24,920
Eleíson.

1605
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:31,560
l've been shot.

1606
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:35,200
l'm confused.

1607
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:38,800
Why would l get shot?

1608
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:42,920
Please don't die.

1609
01:49:44,119 --> 01:49:48,280
Jerry.

1610
01:49:48,359 --> 01:49:50,520
You shot me in the chest.

1611
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:57,360
Why would you shoot me in the chest
after eveything l've achieved?

1612
01:49:58,199 --> 01:50:01,200
Please don't die.

1613
01:50:02,239 --> 01:50:05,720
Jerry.

1614
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:08,920
Accidentally shot
by a man in a diaper

1615
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,240
trying to kill a member of 
the Ku Klux Klan.

1616
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:17,400
Not exactly the epitaph
l was hoping for.

1617
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:22,120
Still. it might look good in Latin.

1618
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:26,160
Who will speak for us?

1619
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:32,640
- What do you mean?
- When you are gone.

1620
01:50:34,199 --> 01:50:36,680
You've got lots of people out there.

1621
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:40,960
You got Oprah Winfrey.

1622
01:50:41,039 --> 01:50:43,120
She's too tame.

1623
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:47,240
Sally Jesse Raphael.

1624
01:50:47,319 --> 01:50:49,880
She's too old.

1625
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,880
Dr. Phil.

1626
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:55,960
He's too shit.

1627
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,680
Ricki Lake.

1628
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:08,720
l guess she's OK.

1629
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:11,600
Now. if you don't mind.

1630
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:16,080
l think l'll ty to get
to a hospital.

1631
01:51:16,159 --> 01:51:20,160
Wait. Jerry.

1632
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:25,760
Final thoughts.

1633
01:51:30,319 --> 01:51:32,520
Well. firstly.

1634
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:35,200
l'd like to add my name
to the list of celebrities

1635
01:51:35,279 --> 01:51:37,680
calling for tighter gun control.

1636
01:51:42,199 --> 01:51:45,680
Secondly. it's been a helluva day.

1637
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:51,320
l've learned that there
are no absolutes of good and evil

1638
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:58,000
and that we all live
in a glorious state of flux.

1639
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
What can l say?

1640
01:52:02,399 --> 01:52:05,200
You're not looking
at a dying man here.

1641
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:09,200
You're looking at yourselves

1642
01:52:10,199 --> 01:52:13,800
in a matter of months or years
or whatever.

1643
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:18,000
And. for better or for worse.

1644
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,200
history defines us by what we do

1645
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:26,120
and what we choose not to do.

1646
01:52:28,279 --> 01:52:30,520
Hopefully.

1647
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:33,720
what will survive of us is love.

1648
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:38,200
So. until the next time.

1649
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:41,920
take care of yourselves

1650
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,600
and each other.

1651
01:52:53,319 --> 01:53:04,920
Ta...

1652
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:11,080
Take care of yourselves

1653
01:53:11,159 --> 01:53:12,960

01:53:13,039 --> 01:53:14,680
and each other.

1655

Take care

1656
01:53:17,359 --> 01:53:20,800
Take care of yourselves

1657
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:22,600

Take care of yourselves.

and each other.

1663
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:37,680
and each other.

1664
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:43,680
Take. take care of yourselves

1665
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:45,440
and each other.

1666
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:49,160
Take care of each other.

1667
01:53:49,239 --> 01:53:53,120
Take care of each other.

1668
01:53:53,199 --> 01:53:56,880
Take care of yourselves.

1669
01:53:56,960 --> 01:54:00,800
Take care of yourselves.

Each other.

1673
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:17,480
Each other.

1674
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:20,880
Each other.

1675
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:24,680
Each other.

1676
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:28,440
Each other.

1677
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:32,200
Take care of yourselves
and each other.

1678

Take care of yourselves

lt so ain't easy being me.

1682
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:05,040
Billions of voices
making all the wrong choices.

1683
01:55:05,119 --> 01:55:09,720
then turning round and blaming me.

making all the wrong choices.

1699
01:56:29,319 --> 01:56:31,320

Momma gimme smack on the asshole.

Everything will be alright.
