Writing on the gateway:
"Close the gate when you walk in"

26
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:00,984
Re-lieved by joyfull song

She never lest sadden

28

Cities and countrysides admire the song

And admire the song bigger towns

30

Song helps us to live and to love

31
00:03:18,697 --> 00:03:22,785
She like a friend calls and leads

We are able to sing and laugh, like children

45
00:05:15,876 --> 00:05:18,129
Among obdurate fight and work

46
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:24,165
So we were born like this

47
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,787
That we never give up, nowhere and never

48

Here's the list!

Stand at ease!

69
00:08:01,453 --> 00:08:05,124
Oh how you played walking through the countryside

70
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:10,073
For a music like this
they should rip hands off.

71
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:13,556
You, Germans are
a hot nation.

72
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:16,265
Can this be called "playing"?

73
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,786
You should play like Sapojnik!

74
00:08:18,821 --> 00:08:22,074
Mister, please don't
compare me to him.

75
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:24,600
I can't play likeSapojnik.

76
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:28,056
Sapojnik has been doing it
for seven years,

77
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,528
And I only for two!

78
00:08:29,563 --> 00:08:30,892
Shut up!

79
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,056
Take your violin and play!

80
00:08:34,753 --> 00:08:36,709
What should I play?

81
00:08:36,744 --> 00:08:38,665
Oh... play this!

82
00:09:10,202 --> 00:09:11,958
Well!

83
00:09:11,993 --> 00:09:15,121
The scores came to bits.

84
00:10:14,764 --> 00:10:17,642
Costa Frascini!

85
00:10:23,326 --> 00:10:25,524
Frascini, composer?

86
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,729
Conductor. He arrived today.

87
00:10:28,946 --> 00:10:31,616
Mom, mom!

88
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,145
I'm coming, I'm coming.

89
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,301
Where he is?

90
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:55,203
Here!

91
00:10:55,432 --> 00:10:58,811
In foreign bathrobe.

92
00:11:02,044 --> 00:11:05,422
I'm going to meet him.

93
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:08,473
But it's not quite the thing.

94
00:11:09,332 --> 00:11:13,377
Stay calm.
I'll do it subtly.

95
00:11:34,745 --> 00:11:38,915
...will never and nowhere be lost.

96
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:14,884
Allright.

97
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:19,972
Enough for today.

98
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:29,208
Auf viedersehen.

99
00:12:29,243 --> 00:12:31,863
Goodbye.

100
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:55,223
Please tell me,
do we have hot water today?

101
00:14:55,258 --> 00:14:56,804
Yes.

102
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,592
Let's get to know ourselves.

103
00:15:30,536 --> 00:15:33,192
Look. a fish!

104
00:15:33,227 --> 00:15:35,848
Fish, fish, fish.

105
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:40,431
My mum is delighted
with your music.

106
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:45,754
You are such a young man,
and yet a genius.

107
00:15:47,026 --> 00:15:48,987
But... how it is possible?

108
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:51,212
Habit.

109
00:15:51,247 --> 00:15:55,210
Pplease tell me,
what are you playing now?

110
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:58,266
I'm working on Beethoven.

111
00:15:58,301 --> 00:16:00,475
-Who?
-Beethoven.

112
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:05,255
How I envy you.

113
00:16:05,426 --> 00:16:07,860
And where are you living?

114
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:10,172
In "Transparent sources".

115
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:13,543
Oh, there!
Nearly on the top.

116
00:16:13,578 --> 00:16:14,314
You made a life, mister.

117
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:17,019
And you're alone there?
Aren't you sad?

118
00:16:17,054 --> 00:16:18,297
Why alone?

119
00:16:18,332 --> 00:16:20,605
There is a lot of us.

120
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,435
He's got a professor here...

121
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,029
...secretaries.

122
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:28,150
And... dutchwomen...

123
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,005
...swisswomen.

124
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,419
Walking by road
we play wonderfull concerts.

125
00:16:33,454 --> 00:16:34,311
Are they pretty?

126
00:16:34,346 --> 00:16:35,464
Who?

127
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:36,381
Dutchwomen.

128
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:39,252
Oh, dutchwomen are elegant...

129
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:41,054
Shapes they have...

130
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:42,821
...o, shapes like this.

131
00:16:42,856 --> 00:16:45,143
Eyes...

132
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:48,010
...o, eyes like this.

133
00:16:48,045 --> 00:16:50,360
Are you taking care of them?

134
00:16:50,395 --> 00:16:53,524
How could I not?
From morning 'till evening.

135
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:57,052
I'd like to be on their place.

136
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,223
And what are you doing?

137
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:02,030
Me?

138
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:03,815
I'm a singer.

139
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,496
A singer!

140
00:17:05,531 --> 00:17:07,074
Sing something, lady.

141
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,620
Now?
Here?

142
00:17:08,655 --> 00:17:10,036
Well... yes.

143
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:13,366
In costume it's not quite a thing.

144
00:17:13,695 --> 00:17:16,072
But if you'd agree...

145
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:16,808
What?

146
00:17:16,843 --> 00:17:19,197
...to come to us.

147
00:17:19,232 --> 00:17:23,111
I? To you?
And where do you live?

148
00:17:23,146 --> 00:17:25,084
In "Black Swan".

149
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,884
Oh, you made a life.

150
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:30,548
I'll get you to know with my mother.
Please come.

151
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,140
And she won't be angry?

152
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:36,180
What you..?
My mum will die from joy!.

153
00:17:36,996 --> 00:17:40,708
Well.
If she dies, I'll come.

154
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:45,524
So, everything is established,
I'll be waiting for you.

155
00:17:58,264 --> 00:18:01,226
Ay, what a woman?

156
00:18:07,107 --> 00:18:10,026
You could die for her!

157
00:18:12,364 --> 00:18:16,827
In this frock-coat I played
in 1893 in Stuttgart.

158
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:27,738
Oh God, I was the same
about 40 years ago.

159
00:18:36,503 --> 00:18:40,507
Today you're playing in front of the audience.

160
00:18:42,953 --> 00:18:46,665
Bring dignity out of you.

161
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:53,473
Guest house for
disorganized patients,
earlier "Black Swan"

162
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:57,021
He's not here yet?

163
00:18:57,056 --> 00:18:58,690
He's not!

164
00:18:58,725 --> 00:19:02,187
Someone should go for him.

165
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,849
And whou would do it?

166
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:09,066
I.
And only for you, madam.

167
00:19:18,202 --> 00:19:21,914
We'll start when he arrives.

168
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:34,268
He'll arrive for me,

169
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:37,534
I'll wait for him.

170
00:19:38,396 --> 00:19:41,775
No,no,no
no one's better than him

171
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,705
I'll approach and start.

172
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,061
I'm all burning and I don't know why

173
00:19:48,913 --> 00:19:51,332
Dear heart! How should I live now?

174
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:55,211
Ah, why from all the men, the only one

175
00:19:57,755 --> 00:20:01,216
Can we love in our life!

176
00:20:04,565 --> 00:20:07,401
Heart in chest!

177
00:20:10,698 --> 00:20:13,784
Is falpping like a bird

178
00:20:15,838 --> 00:20:19,801
And you want to know,
what's waiting for you

179
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,836
And you want to gain happiness.

180
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,639
Joy is singing like
spring skylark

181
00:20:38,897 --> 00:20:41,900
Life if warm and bright

182
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:48,061
If I had ten hearts

183
00:20:52,957 --> 00:20:56,169
I'd give every single one to him

184
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:03,021
Heart in chest

185
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:09,493
Is flipping like a bird

186
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:17,267
And you want to know,
what's waiting for you

187
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,563
And you want to gain happiness.

188
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,145
No,no,no
no one's better than him

189
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:45,547
I'll approach and get to know!

190
00:21:53,581 --> 00:21:57,084
How many times have I told you,
not to make draughts!

191
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:59,383
Don't forget that I have a voice!

192
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,569
I also have a voice!

193
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:02,110
Yes. voice...

194
00:22:02,145 --> 00:22:03,646
..which should be silent...

195
00:22:03,681 --> 00:22:06,786
...when I talk to you!

196
00:22:06,883 --> 00:22:09,719
Why aren't you
dressed up yet?

197
00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:11,987
I didn't made it.

198
00:22:12,022 --> 00:22:14,095
Why I made it?

199
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,842
Immediately go and dress up.

200
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:32,656
Maestro!

201
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,488
Why aren't you coming up?

202
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:37,915
Me?

203
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,303
I'm not alone...

204
00:22:40,338 --> 00:22:44,092
It's about they're waiting for me.

205
00:22:44,522 --> 00:22:48,067
That's silly,
come together.

206
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:50,327
Togehter?

207
00:22:53,604 --> 00:22:56,037
No.. maybe next time.

208
00:22:56,072 --> 00:22:59,909
But absolutely, you have to come.
You promised.

209
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:02,291
One minute.

210
00:23:02,326 --> 00:23:05,871
I'll talk it with
my band.

211
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:08,672
Then maybe I'll come.

212
00:24:24,454 --> 00:24:26,718
Good morning.

213
00:24:26,753 --> 00:24:28,982
Ach, master came.

214
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,093
Please meet my mother.

215
00:24:45,128 --> 00:24:48,840
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

216
00:24:50,821 --> 00:24:54,116
What's with you?
What could it be?

217
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,038
Nice to meet you.

218
00:25:00,073 --> 00:25:01,966
What's happeinng?

219
00:25:05,561 --> 00:25:07,897
What's up with you?

220
00:25:07,932 --> 00:25:08,749
Nothing.

221
00:25:08,784 --> 00:25:10,663
I'm just thinking...

222
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:14,494
What will woman like this one do on 8th march?
Simply slaughter.

223
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,555
And what?

224
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,510
She has no hands,
she has no vote.

225
00:25:23,682 --> 00:25:26,769
We invite to dance

226
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,269
Well, let's dance.

227
00:26:16,025 --> 00:26:19,820
Maestro, so far
you ran from me?

228
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,948
Why are you so
devoted to this place?

229
00:26:26,983 --> 00:26:28,274
- You can see it?
- What?

230
00:26:28,309 --> 00:26:29,531
That I'm devoted.

231
00:26:29,566 --> 00:26:32,819
Of course, on this place
you're visible for everyone.

232
00:26:32,854 --> 00:26:34,771
About what place are you talking?

233
00:26:34,806 --> 00:26:36,688
- About a window.
- Oh, a window.

234
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:40,198
I thought that about a place
I'm deovted to.

235
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,238
I mean you
haven't noticed nothing?

236
00:26:42,273 --> 00:26:42,995
No.

237
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,907
And that I'm devoted,
haven't you noticed?

238
00:26:44,942 --> 00:26:46,662
It seemed to me...

239
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:48,950
Oh, it seemed to me.

240
00:26:48,985 --> 00:26:51,079
Please don't scare me.

241
00:26:51,114 --> 00:26:53,742
You're joking and I,
thought you noticed.

242
00:26:53,777 --> 00:26:56,248
How strange you are.

243
00:26:56,969 --> 00:26:59,045
Well. let's dance.

244
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,292
All right, go without me
I'll come later.

245
00:27:03,327 --> 00:27:05,563
Good.

246
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:08,926
We'll drink a cup of kruszon (vodka)

247
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,869
What?

248
00:27:10,904 --> 00:27:12,778
Kruszon.

249
00:27:33,214 --> 00:27:35,841
And where are you going?

250
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:45,526
So?

251
00:27:45,561 --> 00:27:46,959
Och, strong!

252
00:27:46,994 --> 00:27:50,289
It can sweep a bull off his feet.

253
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,994
When I'll see you again?

254
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:10,908
Tomorrow I can't, I have a hairdresser.

255
00:28:10,943 --> 00:28:14,231
Maybe... tomorrow evening?

256
00:28:14,557 --> 00:28:17,477
You'll come to the oak.

257
00:28:18,302 --> 00:28:21,013
Will you?

258
00:28:22,004 --> 00:28:24,715
Will you?

259
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:27,416
Yes.

260
00:28:35,427 --> 00:28:37,705
I feel...

261
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,661
...that my heart is goning to rip apart!

262
00:28:52,076 --> 00:28:56,581
Maestro, maybe play something for us?

263
00:28:56,616 --> 00:28:58,880
Please.

264
00:29:05,817 --> 00:29:07,941
I don't have my violin...

265
00:29:07,976 --> 00:29:10,065
... I'll play on this.

266
00:33:00,617 --> 00:33:03,287
Out of here!

267
00:33:05,953 --> 00:33:08,372
Bravo.

268
00:33:24,195 --> 00:33:27,698
Without glasses I can't see a thing.

269
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:54,702
Time to eat something!

270
00:33:54,737 --> 00:33:58,006
Maestro, to the table.

271
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:15,875
Aniuta, Aniuta!

272
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:18,406
Where's Aniuta?

273
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:23,862
In a minute, a minute.

274
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:28,604
In a minute, a minute.

275
00:34:50,187 --> 00:34:52,064
Please fetch spirit of camphor.

276
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:53,732
Where it is?

277
00:34:53,767 --> 00:34:55,366
In bedroom.

278
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,369
My God, who's this?

279
00:35:51,404 --> 00:35:53,156
First time in my life..!

280
00:35:56,462 --> 00:35:59,047
Good toy, well made.

281
00:35:59,082 --> 00:36:01,740
Looks like it's living.

282
00:36:01,775 --> 00:36:04,236
Better are made abroad.

283
00:36:04,271 --> 00:36:08,483
Please look at the head.
Is this a sheep?

284
00:36:09,129 --> 00:36:12,549
Head indeed... it's not the best part.

285
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:15,689
But the chopper is very similar.

286
00:36:18,808 --> 00:36:24,022
By the way,
I'd like to keep the memory
about today evening.

287
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,592
Do you have a photograph?

288
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:31,816
I have, but it's really small.

289
00:36:39,641 --> 00:36:42,143
Here it is.

290
00:36:45,016 --> 00:36:51,606
If you are so kind, please
give it to me with your autograph.

291
00:36:52,822 --> 00:36:53,783
With what?

292
00:36:53,818 --> 00:36:55,775
With autograph.

293
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:59,231
Miss Helena,
I wouldn't scant you anything...

294
00:36:59,266 --> 00:37:02,577
...but I don't have what I don't have.

295
00:37:50,337 --> 00:37:53,841
Where you came, run away.

296
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:11,196
Carefully, hang tough lady.

297
00:38:11,231 --> 00:38:14,689
Carefully, hang tough lady.

298
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:17,521
Carefully....

299
00:38:23,276 --> 00:38:26,182
Hang tough lady!

300
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:29,089
Carefully...

301
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:03,558
A tiger!

302
00:39:04,699 --> 00:39:06,367
Tiger.

303
00:39:21,786 --> 00:39:24,538
God... who's this?

304
00:39:25,451 --> 00:39:27,870
It's me.

305
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,036
How you came here?

306
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:33,616
I went to the composer, Frascini.

307
00:39:34,811 --> 00:39:36,605
But he'a already here.

308
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,400
No, he's there.

309
00:39:38,435 --> 00:39:42,564
How he could be there, if it's him?

310
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,848
No.
It's not him.

311
00:39:50,783 --> 00:39:53,536
Who are you?

312
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:56,362
Me?
Kolka Patiechin.

313
00:39:56,397 --> 00:40:00,151
- What Patiechin?
- Herdsman.

314
00:40:00,501 --> 00:40:01,703
How herdsman?

315
00:40:01,738 --> 00:40:02,989
As per usual, herdsman.

316
00:40:03,024 --> 00:40:04,847
Usual herdsman?

317
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:08,427
No, not usual, but main!

318
00:40:10,777 --> 00:40:13,689
- Young man...
- Please call Lena...

319
00:40:13,724 --> 00:40:16,519
Herdsman has nothing to talk
to my daughter.

320
00:40:16,554 --> 00:40:22,601
I hope that this misunderstanding
will remain between us.

321
00:40:23,283 --> 00:40:26,745
Please take this and go away.

322
00:40:27,187 --> 00:40:29,820
But you invited
me yourself...

323
00:40:29,855 --> 00:40:33,567
Yes, but the thought that
you are a musician...

324
00:40:33,602 --> 00:40:35,517
... and you are a herdsman.

325
00:40:35,552 --> 00:40:39,639
Today herdsman...
and... and tomorrow musician.

326
00:40:39,972 --> 00:40:43,768
So please come "tomorrow".

327
00:40:44,313 --> 00:40:47,483
Now get along!
Away!

328
00:42:09,948 --> 00:42:13,744
There are lots of pretty girls

329
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:17,703
There are lots of pretty names

330
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:21,624
But only one bothers

331
00:42:21,659 --> 00:42:24,828
Taking calm and sleep away

332
00:42:24,863 --> 00:42:27,728
When you are in love.

333
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:31,858
Love will stun you unexpected

334
00:42:32,611 --> 00:42:36,449
When you don't bide it

335
00:42:37,271 --> 00:42:40,274
And suddenly every evening becames

336
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:43,183
Suprisingly beautiful

337
00:42:43,218 --> 00:42:45,882
And you sing

338
00:42:46,074 --> 00:42:50,620
Heart, you don't want to be calm

339
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:59,045
Heart, how good is to live

340
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:08,135
Heart, how good you are like this

341
00:43:10,928 --> 00:43:15,140
Thank you heart that you can love like this.

342
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,666
Heart, you don't want to be calm

343
00:43:31,122 --> 00:43:35,209
Heart, how good is to live

344
00:43:40,123 --> 00:43:44,419
Heart, how good you
are like thid

345
00:43:47,174 --> 00:43:51,136
Thank you heart that you can...

346
00:43:56,095 --> 00:43:58,723
...love like this.

347
00:44:03,065 --> 00:44:05,943
Hours have passed..

348
00:44:19,036 --> 00:44:21,622
Konstant Iwanowicz.

349
00:44:21,657 --> 00:44:24,258
To me?

350
00:44:25,528 --> 00:44:28,239
I'm here for Helena Siergiejewna.

351
00:44:31,662 --> 00:44:34,414
Lena sent you here?

352
00:44:34,449 --> 00:44:39,037
Wait, wait...
I've seen you before.

353
00:44:39,709 --> 00:44:42,920
I've seen you
many times.

354
00:44:42,955 --> 00:44:43,774
By morning.

355
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:46,323
When I buy milk...

356
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:50,904
...you always pass by
with your herd.

357
00:44:56,875 --> 00:44:59,545
Is she mad?

358
00:44:59,743 --> 00:45:03,372
A mosquito was sitting on you,
Konstanty Iwanowicz

359
00:45:03,407 --> 00:45:05,203
There are lots of mosquitos.

360
00:45:05,238 --> 00:45:07,991
But why she didn't came
be herself?

361
00:45:08,026 --> 00:45:09,063
Who?

362
00:45:09,098 --> 00:45:09,983
Lena.

363
00:45:10,018 --> 00:45:13,605
You live here permanently?

364
00:45:13,641 --> 00:45:15,082
She's mad at me.

365
00:45:15,117 --> 00:45:18,203
Who taught you to play like this?

366
00:45:18,238 --> 00:45:19,742
Where is Lena?

367
00:45:19,777 --> 00:45:21,361
I'm going away tomorrow.

368
00:45:21,396 --> 00:45:22,701
And Lena?

369
00:45:22,736 --> 00:45:23,925
Today.

370
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,504
Is going away?

371
00:45:26,627 --> 00:45:29,380
Oh, she went away!

372
00:45:31,527 --> 00:45:32,926
She sailed by steamboat.

373
00:45:32,961 --> 00:45:36,506
And I'm going by train, tomorrow.

374
00:45:38,178 --> 00:45:40,805
She went away.

375
00:45:43,316 --> 00:45:46,695
It was a big mosquito,
Konstanty Iwanowicz.

376
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:48,460
Mosquito, mosquito...

377
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:52,040
...and she, unfortunately, went away.

378
00:45:52,075 --> 00:45:53,198
I thought...

379
00:45:53,233 --> 00:45:57,820
... thought, thought.
Too late.

380
00:45:59,409 --> 00:46:01,536
Konstantynie Iwanowiczu.

381
00:46:01,571 --> 00:46:03,554
Kostia!

382
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:06,300
Kostiaaaaaa!

383
00:46:35,373 --> 00:46:39,085
I'm all burning and I don't know why

384
00:46:40,472 --> 00:46:43,933
Dear heart! How should I live now?

385
00:46:45,967 --> 00:46:49,930
Ah, why from all the men, the only one

386
00:46:53,418 --> 00:46:56,671
Can we love in our life!

387
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,904
Heart in chest!

388
00:47:06,521 --> 00:47:09,649
Is flapping like a bird

389
00:47:12,613 --> 00:47:16,617
And you want to know, what's waiting for you

390
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:23,816
And you want to gain happiness.

391
00:47:37,985 --> 00:47:41,947
And you want to know,
what's waiting for you

392
00:47:41,982 --> 00:47:45,482
And you want to gain happiness.

393
00:47:52,206 --> 00:47:55,460
Joy is singing like
spring skylark

394
00:47:55,495 --> 00:47:58,910
Life is warm and bright

395
00:47:58,945 --> 00:48:02,325
If I had ten hearts

396
00:48:06,703 --> 00:48:09,998
I'd give every single one to him.

397
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:17,467
Heart in chest

398
00:48:20,406 --> 00:48:23,909
Is flipping like a bird

399
00:48:26,938 --> 00:48:31,943
And you want to know,
what's waiting for you

400
00:48:39,522 --> 00:48:44,485
And you want to gain happiness.

401
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:09,616
Month's up.

402
00:49:14,253 --> 00:49:19,258
The minute hand
runs throught clock face

403
00:49:19,395 --> 00:49:24,233
Quickly as mad
are running cogwheels.

404
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:28,527
Minutes are jumping
throught troubles and cases

405
00:49:29,511 --> 00:49:32,556
Jumpin, jumping, jumping...

406
00:49:32,591 --> 00:49:35,671
...and so month's up.

407
00:50:23,001 --> 00:50:25,396
Yes.
But the conductor is still not here!

408
00:50:25,431 --> 00:50:28,767
How will he conduct,
if the orchestra had never seen him?

409
00:50:28,802 --> 00:50:29,538
- It a scandal.
- What to do!

410
00:50:29,573 --> 00:50:30,773
- The audience is making you mad?
Yes.

411
00:50:30,808 --> 00:50:33,853
So why are you staying here?
Go and calm them!

412
00:50:38,894 --> 00:50:43,107
You, why are you staying?

413
00:50:43,142 --> 00:50:45,627
Come here!

414
00:50:49,011 --> 00:50:51,513
Hold!

415
00:51:02,832 --> 00:51:07,128
Strange.
We only have 5 minutes
and he's not here!

416
00:51:07,163 --> 00:51:08,770
How will we play?

417
00:51:08,805 --> 00:51:10,892
The worst is that without any rehearsal.

418
00:51:10,927 --> 00:51:12,834
And also they say,
that he's a freak.

419
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:16,748
We need to follow
his every move and gesture.

420
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:20,493
"Passing on the backstage prohibited"

421
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:21,839
Haven't you seen the one
in jacket...

422
00:52:21,874 --> 00:52:24,308
... and white hat?

423
00:52:24,343 --> 00:52:26,742
To hell with it all!

424
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:28,959
Could be worse.

425
00:52:28,994 --> 00:52:31,141
We lost him.

426
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,207
- Here, please.
- Gracias.

427
00:53:32,989 --> 00:53:36,159
Please don't aggrevate.
Everything will be allright.

428
00:55:17,144 --> 00:55:18,328
Understand me!

429
00:55:18,363 --> 00:55:20,243
Understand me!

430
00:55:20,278 --> 00:55:22,124
Oh, stupid.

431
00:55:30,687 --> 00:55:33,982
Original conduction.

432
00:55:35,267 --> 00:55:36,746
Mom!

433
00:55:36,781 --> 00:55:39,283
We threw away the real one!

434
00:55:39,318 --> 00:55:41,799
Guve me binocular!

435
00:56:04,582 --> 00:56:09,129
Emma, for these tears
I love you even more.

436
00:57:33,404 --> 00:57:37,491
Maestro, you're mad at me.
But it wasn't me.

437
00:57:37,526 --> 00:57:41,476
It was my mum.
I'm so rancorous.

438
00:57:41,728 --> 00:57:44,689
Forgive the elderly lady.

439
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:48,887
Let's bow... bow.

440
00:58:14,149 --> 00:58:18,570
It was nice to meet you.
Let's go for a dinner.

441
00:58:22,552 --> 00:58:26,514
The races begin again.

442
00:59:02,901 --> 00:59:05,820
Now that's a man!

443
00:59:06,365 --> 00:59:09,076
Amazing.

444
00:59:09,313 --> 00:59:13,317
We need one like this
to the orchestra.

445
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,659
Hold him!
Hold!

446
00:59:44,694 --> 00:59:47,238
We do, we do!

447
00:59:50,324 --> 00:59:53,578
Hold him.
Harder.

448
01:00:10,599 --> 01:00:13,477
And so, are you
joining our orchestra?

449
01:00:13,512 --> 01:00:15,229
Orchestra?

450
01:00:15,264 --> 01:00:16,947
Do you agree?

451
01:00:16,982 --> 01:00:19,270
Agree!

452
01:00:20,396 --> 01:00:23,733
Months have passed.

453
01:00:42,183 --> 01:00:45,937
"Friendship"
music band

454
01:01:06,279 --> 01:01:08,465
How you play?

455
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,509
It's not me.

456
01:01:10,544 --> 01:01:14,715
I can't exercise
in those conditions!

457
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,560
It unnerves...

458
01:01:19,186 --> 01:01:21,939
Behind a wall.

459
01:01:24,125 --> 01:01:28,296
Hey, you!
Couldn.t you be quiet?

460
01:01:30,936 --> 01:01:33,010
I can't work!

461
01:01:33,045 --> 01:01:36,257
Do your best, I'll go
and make a complaint to commandant.

462
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:39,701
Well, come on, let's try.

463
01:01:57,025 --> 01:01:59,360
This phrase should be played differently!

464
01:02:00,847 --> 01:02:03,391
No, like this!

465
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:05,319
He's right.

466
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:06,248
No, he's not!

467
01:02:06,283 --> 01:02:07,068
No, he is right!

468
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:10,481
This phrase should be played like this!

469
01:02:10,806 --> 01:02:13,350
No, this!

470
01:02:15,467 --> 01:02:17,928
And so?

471
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:25,370
Okay, play,
but hands close to yourself!

472
01:02:31,716 --> 01:02:33,353
Comrade commandant.

473
01:02:33,388 --> 01:02:34,866
We are
artists.

474
01:02:34,901 --> 01:02:37,417
We need
dead silence.

475
01:02:37,452 --> 01:02:40,955
And devil knows,
what's going on from the morning.

476
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:41,878
Szum, tararam.

477
01:02:41,913 --> 01:02:44,516
Please embark
something, comrade commandant.

478
01:02:44,551 --> 01:02:47,119
Please pay attention,
to what's happening there.

479
01:02:47,154 --> 01:02:49,261
Devil knows what
comrade commandant.

480
01:02:49,296 --> 01:02:51,121
Please do your best.

481
01:03:04,098 --> 01:03:07,184
O, that's how it sholud be played!

482
01:04:14,679 --> 01:04:18,558
Please pay attention,
comrade commandant,
it's a mess!

483
01:04:22,283 --> 01:04:25,578
To my mind, it's not there.

484
01:04:26,107 --> 01:04:28,064
To my mind, it's nearby.

485
01:04:28,099 --> 01:04:31,527
It's not you,
comrade Patiechin?

486
01:04:31,562 --> 01:04:35,233
Comrade commandant.
We are artists...

487
01:05:37,124 --> 01:05:38,721
Of course it's you!

488
01:05:38,756 --> 01:05:43,261
But what are you, comrade,
but...

489
01:05:48,755 --> 01:05:51,125
...artists...!

490
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,496
We're in silence!

491
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:59,670
Dead silence.

492
01:06:02,177 --> 01:06:04,554
What was happening here?

493
01:06:05,801 --> 01:06:09,889
We ha.. had..
ha... had rehearsal!

494
01:06:12,415 --> 01:06:15,334
You had a rehearsaland I'll kick you out!

495
01:06:37,666 --> 01:06:40,181
Everything fizzled out.

496
01:06:40,216 --> 01:06:42,529
First time in our life...

497
01:06:42,564 --> 01:06:45,901
...we go into Great Theather...

498
01:06:45,936 --> 01:06:49,213
...and so... very well.

499
01:06:51,805 --> 01:06:54,266
And where are
we going to do rehearsal now?

500
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:56,390
Rehearsals?
We have no place for it!

501
01:06:56,425 --> 01:07:00,846
Me must serve notice,
that we won't play.

502
01:07:03,913 --> 01:07:07,083
I know where're going to do rehearsal.

503
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:08,340
Where?

504
01:07:08,375 --> 01:07:11,837
Boys, follow me, we're going.

505
01:07:11,872 --> 01:07:14,804
We're going, boys.

506
01:07:28,927 --> 01:07:31,012
Lena is working.

507
01:10:14,406 --> 01:10:19,160
Lenoczka!
Eggs worked?

508
01:10:21,375 --> 01:10:25,463
Now you'll be accepted for Great Theater!

509
01:10:26,117 --> 01:10:28,744
Lenoczka.

510
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:35,037
What's up with you?

511
01:10:36,672 --> 01:10:40,425
Comrades.
Concert in fifteen minutes.

512
01:10:42,526 --> 01:10:44,787
Twenty roubles
to the Great Theater.

513
01:10:44,822 --> 01:10:47,552
What's with you
are you joking?.

514
01:10:47,587 --> 01:10:49,987
I'm going to the garage.
Alone.

515
01:10:50,022 --> 01:10:52,387
Go, I wont't do you any harm.

516
01:10:52,422 --> 01:10:55,455
Boys, get in.

517
01:11:03,955 --> 01:11:07,027
Citizens, beware.

518
01:11:07,062 --> 01:11:09,252
The hearse is not made of rubber.

519
01:11:09,287 --> 01:11:11,443
No more will fit in.
Whereinto?

520
01:11:16,342 --> 01:11:18,594
We're off.

521
01:12:22,857 --> 01:12:25,318
Did anything happen to you?

522
01:12:25,353 --> 01:12:27,669
Aniuta!

523
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:31,480
Where are you going?

524
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:33,614
I don't know.

525
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:35,106
Going with us?

526
01:12:35,141 --> 01:12:36,352
I don't know.

527
01:12:36,387 --> 01:12:38,578
So, we're off.

528
01:12:38,613 --> 01:12:40,769
Boys, take her.

529
01:12:59,904 --> 01:13:03,407
Hey, and who will pay?
Puszkin?

530
01:13:04,248 --> 01:13:07,001
Pay for what?

531
01:13:07,074 --> 01:13:09,947
We rode?
We rode!

532
01:13:09,982 --> 01:13:14,278
You decided 30 roubles extra?
Decided!

533
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:17,201
No doubt!

534
01:13:18,187 --> 01:13:20,819
You'll sit here, lady.

535
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:25,400
Unless they pay,
I won't let you.

536
01:13:38,619 --> 01:13:43,124
Let's continue our concert.

537
01:13:44,354 --> 01:13:48,837
And now...
Liszt's music band

538
01:13:48,872 --> 01:13:53,320
from mill operators' guild

539
01:14:33,505 --> 01:14:34,923
Whereinto?

540
01:14:34,958 --> 01:14:37,321
Sit!

541
01:14:37,766 --> 01:14:38,684
What. isn't it working?

542
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,363
No.

543
01:14:39,398 --> 01:14:42,651
Give it to me, I'll try.

544
01:14:55,051 --> 01:14:55,973
Play!

545
01:14:56,008 --> 01:14:58,052
- On what?
- With your lips.

546
01:14:58,087 --> 01:14:59,958
But how?

547
01:15:03,137 --> 01:15:06,129
She's shaking.

548
01:15:06,164 --> 01:15:09,501
She will catch cold.

549
01:15:09,991 --> 01:15:13,370
Shroud yourself.

550
01:15:15,487 --> 01:15:18,949
Filemon, Filemon, wake up!

551
01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:22,835
Take out half a liter.

552
01:15:27,315 --> 01:15:29,109
Stay, stay...!

553
01:15:30,023 --> 01:15:32,151
Leave something for the lady.

554
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:36,721
Drink.

555
01:15:36,756 --> 01:15:39,884
What you.. I don't drink.

556
01:15:40,499 --> 01:15:43,961
Please drink,
or you'll catch a cold.

557
01:15:44,681 --> 01:15:46,358
I don't want.

558
01:15:46,393 --> 01:15:49,270
Don't talk, drink!

559
01:16:40,242 --> 01:16:44,663
Go on, squarely,
to be happy!

560
01:17:08,602 --> 01:17:11,271
Pot...

561
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:16,594
Get together, lady.

562
01:17:16,687 --> 01:17:18,325
Whereto?

563
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,388
You'll go with me.

564
01:17:20,423 --> 01:17:22,416
We're going to them.

565
01:17:22,451 --> 01:17:24,498
I'll wait here.

566
01:17:24,533 --> 01:17:27,411
We're going, as I say!

567
01:17:57,751 --> 01:18:00,545
Where are ours?

568
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:14,331
Wait here.

569
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:57,053
Don take offences, comrades,
but I have a witness..

570
01:18:58,531 --> 01:19:02,034
Forgive me comrades,
the ride is made?

571
01:19:02,069 --> 01:19:03,158
Made!

572
01:19:03,193 --> 01:19:05,828
We decided 30 roubles?

573
01:19:05,863 --> 01:19:08,294
Decided.
And no talking!

574
01:19:08,329 --> 01:19:10,844
I need to drive
the deceased back.

575
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:13,549
Wait, we'll finish our work
and go back.

576
01:19:13,584 --> 01:19:14,828
Deceased, comrade.

577
01:19:14,863 --> 01:19:18,325
Deceased will wait,
he's got no hurry.

578
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:19,669
Give me the money!

579
01:19:42,743 --> 01:19:46,330
Aniuta, Aniuta, Aniuta, Aniuta,
what you... what you?

580
01:19:59,155 --> 01:20:02,700
Sing!
Sing!

581
01:20:11,023 --> 01:20:15,110
Aniuta, sing!
sing, Aniuta.

582
01:20:32,769 --> 01:20:36,022
Sing as they please you.

583
01:20:51,371 --> 01:20:54,832
Heart in chest

584
01:20:57,983 --> 01:21:01,987
Is flipping like a bird

585
01:21:04,832 --> 01:21:08,836
And you want to know,
what's waiting for you

586
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:16,732
And you want to gain happiness.

587
01:21:23,832 --> 01:21:27,502
Love will stun you unexpected

588
01:21:28,849 --> 01:21:32,728
When you don't bide it

589
01:21:34,666 --> 01:21:38,586
And suddenly every evening becomes

590
01:21:38,621 --> 01:21:41,656
Suprisingly beautiful

591
01:21:44,384 --> 01:21:47,179
And you sing

592
01:21:52,867 --> 01:21:56,454
Heart, you don't want calm

593
01:22:03,104 --> 01:22:07,150
Heart, how good is
to live

594
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:16,957
Heart, how good you
are just like this

595
01:22:20,786 --> 01:22:24,998
Thank you heart,
that you can love like this.

596
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:33,535
...thant you can love like this.

597
01:23:33,844 --> 01:23:37,155
Ciuch, ciuch, ciuch, ciuch,

598
01:23:37,190 --> 01:23:40,467
Our iron has already warmed up.

599
01:23:40,502 --> 01:23:42,039
You fell in love, realized

600
01:23:42,074 --> 01:23:43,612
You met a wrong womam.

601
01:23:43,647 --> 01:23:45,150
You got mad, looked behind

602
01:23:45,185 --> 01:23:46,514
And saw a beauty one.

603
01:23:46,549 --> 01:23:49,008
Tiuch, tiuch, tiuch, tiuch,

604
01:23:49,043 --> 01:23:51,468
Our iron has already warmed up.

605
01:23:52,562 --> 01:23:54,272
Everyone can make a mistake,

606
01:23:54,307 --> 01:23:55,595
Love is really tiring,

607
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:57,215
Cause not in vain they say:

608
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:58,741
We learn the hard way.

609
01:23:58,776 --> 01:24:02,038
Tiuch, tiuch, tiuch, tiuch,

610
01:24:02,073 --> 01:24:04,424
Our iron has already warmed up.

611
01:24:04,459 --> 01:24:06,776
I'm nothing in comparision to her,

612
01:24:06,811 --> 01:24:08,387
But it'll change.

613
01:24:08,422 --> 01:24:09,926
He'll be mine -

614
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:11,431
And never go away.

615
01:24:48,165 --> 01:24:50,876
Aniuta, I always wanted
to say to you...

616
01:24:53,502 --> 01:24:54,712
Leave her!

617
01:24:54,858 --> 01:24:57,077
Aniuta, I always

618
01:24:57,112 --> 01:24:59,165
Let me speak!

619
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:03,537
Aniuta, I always wanted
to say to you...

620
01:25:30,684 --> 01:25:34,458
Song helps us
to live and to love

621
01:25:34,493 --> 01:25:38,198
Like a friend
calls and leads

622
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:42,237
And who with song
strides through life

623
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:46,158
Will never and nowhere
be lost

624
01:26:09,765 --> 01:26:13,518
Song helps us
to live and to love

625
01:26:13,810 --> 01:26:17,863
Like a friend
calls and leads

626
01:26:17,898 --> 01:26:21,777
And who with song
strides through life

627
01:26:21,812 --> 01:26:25,697
Will never and nowhere be lost

628
01:26:49,763 --> 01:26:53,517
Song helps us
to live and to love

629
01:26:53,767 --> 01:26:57,694
Like a friend
calls and leads

630
01:26:57,729 --> 01:27:01,566
And who with song
strides through life

631
01:27:01,601 --> 01:27:05,410
Will never and nowhere be lost

632
01:27:05,445 --> 01:27:09,533
And who with song
strides through life

633
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:13,453
Will never and nowhere be lost

634
01:27:14,121 --> 01:27:17,707
We are able to sing and laugh,
like children

635
01:27:17,742 --> 01:27:21,253
Among obdurate fight and work

636
01:27:21,795 --> 01:27:25,472
So we were
born like this

637
01:27:25,507 --> 01:27:29,511
That we never give up
nowhere and never

638
01:27:37,644 --> 01:27:41,481
And who with song
strides through life

639
01:27:41,516 --> 01:27:45,318
And who with song
strides through life

640
01:27:45,353 --> 01:27:48,797
Will never and nowhere
be lost

641
01:27:48,832 --> 01:27:52,242
Never and nowhere
be lost!

642
01:28:58,350 --> 01:29:02,062
THE END

643
