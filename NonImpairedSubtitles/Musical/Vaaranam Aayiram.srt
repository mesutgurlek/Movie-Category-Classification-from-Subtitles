1
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:46,832
What a beautiful feeling, man!

2
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,938
Surya, gueSs how many girls you
can get with your talent!

3
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:52,401
You're wasting that chance!

4
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:08,282
Let'S go by car.

5
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:09,679
It iS near only.
Never mind.

6
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,602
Why you never had this Shaved?

7
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,405
It iS just nice.

8
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,340
When they will be back?

9
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,511
They will be back Soon.

10
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,914
I'll go and take bath.

11
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:46,115
Eat your medicine..

12
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:48,991
Letchumi!

13
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,321
I'll bring him up to my room.
- No, let him Sleep here.

14
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:07,600
I'm going to die!
- Don't talk like that!

15
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,802
We will call the doctor.
Everything will be fine.

16
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:10,806
Come!

17
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,480
Shreya!

18
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,249
Leave it!

19
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,181
What had happen?

20
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,049
ASk the doctor to come.
- Careful!

21
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,226
Surya, Surya.

22
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,602
We need to call Surya.

23
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,644
Don't go anywhere!
Be with me.

24
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:34,957
No, it's impoSsible!

25
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,686
HiS blood cells are burSt in
the main artery.

26
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:37,761
His pressure will increase then.

27
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,554
He will face more blood loss.

28
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:41,827
We can't do anything after this.

29
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,129
I've told you earlier that
this will happen, Mrs. Krishnan.

30
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,836
I've gave him medicine.

31
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,630
You can start to inform everyone.

32
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,274
Let him sleep.

33
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,364
What he's looking at?

34
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,044
There's no pulse.

35
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,316
Doctor, please check him!

36
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,622
I thought you'll be fine.

37
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,256
I thought nothing bad will happen to you.
That's why I came to this mission.

38
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,308
I want to see you.
I want to see you now.

39
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,207
Where are you, dad?
Are you with me?

40
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:23,874
Can you see me?

41
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,944
You are with me now, dad.

42
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,212
How is mum now?

43
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,184
Are you staying brave, mom?

44
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,096
That day, we were sitting and
talking all our past stories.

45
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,592
You were telling about
your love story.

46
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:21,004
About how dad and you met
in the first place.

47
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,074
I don't know, mom.
Why?

48
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,312
Your dad is from Uttampalam
and I'm from Madurai.

49
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,140
We met in Madras Christian College.

50
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,016
When we came to study.

51
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,857
He loved me madly.

52
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,598
Our life begun because of that love.

53
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:53,536
Because of that love,
you, Shreya and everything happen.

54
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,051
Krishnan, what are you doing here?

55
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,887
You won't come to library, what!
- One minute, please!

56
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,429
Malini, Malini.

57
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,260
I came behind that girl.

58
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,066
I like that girl very much.

59
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,529
Will you please tell her that?

60
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:28,537
Later.

61
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:29,834
What are you saying, Krishnan?

62
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,076
This is love.
You understand, right?

63
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,278
Do you know, Krishnan?
He's doing BSc. in Chemistry.

64
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,452
I don't knoW.

65
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,821
He asked me to tell you that
he likes you very much.

66
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,455
Don't get me wrong.

67
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,351
One minute, Malini.

68
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,830
Krishnan from BSc. Chemistry
doing final year said he likes you.

69
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,234
What is this, Malini?

70
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,965
Krishnan said he likes you.

71
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,132
Guess how angry I should be!

72
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:06,403
Where ever I go,
people will tell me that.

73
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:07,803
For the whole week.

74
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,739
I've never seen him before that time.

75
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,615
Dad, whenever we talks about you,

76
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,577
I have seen the love in mum's eyes.

77
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,552
Who is Krishnan?
BSc. Chemistry doing final year.

78
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,217
Krishnan, right?
You wait here. Don't go anywhere.

79
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,594
But when the first time I met him,
my anger flew away.

80
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,795
Your dad was so handsome.

81
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,433
He's still handsome.
I will tell.

82
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,780
In one second.

83
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:41,836
In one second.

84
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,880
I need to tell you this.

85
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:50,752
You are so beautiful!

86
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,785
No one here must have seen..

87
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,494
A beauty like this before.

88
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:04,469
Your love is my inspiration in life.

89
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,370
Your love is my inspiration in life.

90
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,098
Inspiration to everything.

91
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,009
He's like you.
Exactly.

92
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,908
I don't have a single cent
with me.

93
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,077
But I'm the most happiest man
on earth.

94
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,980
Are you happy?

95
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,616
Now onwards,
everything is for him.

96
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,950
Everything surround him
must be beautiful.

97
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,128
He must always be happy.

98
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,525
I don't know what is written
for him in life.

99
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,463
But if anything is written wrongly,
I'll rewrite it.

100
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,976
Do you remember when
Shreya was born?

101
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,046
Do you remember our home
in Calicut?

102
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,053
Now, I can remember everything.

103
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,316
Feel like want to be younger again.

104
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,583
Our small bedroom.

105
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:08,359
We did not have money.

106
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,184
It's nothing.

107
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:34,619
Never leave dad's hand, ok.

108
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,624
That day,

109
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,828
I told to myself that I'll never
leave your hand.

110
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,543
When we shifted from
Kerala to Madras,

111
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,177
You didn't follow me by train
but followed your dad by lorry.

112
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,186
I remember.

113
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:06,750
Dad is everything to you.

114
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:09,685
Are you ok, Mani?

115
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,587
I'm ok, sir.
- You take rest.

116
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,858
My son is in this lorry.

117
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:17,435
I'm not taking the risk.
You stop the lorry.

118
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,062
No problem, sir.
- Stop, Mani.

119
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,950
You are my hero, dad.

120
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,698
You have taught me a lot.

121
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,300
If you hold it like this,
you'll get the out pick.

122
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,702
I remember everything now.

123
00:22:58,744 --> 00:22:59,836
Your nice face.

124
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,213
Your body, your voice.
You are my everything.

125
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:08,817
You gave me so much of freedom.

126
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:11,579
You gave everything that I need.

127
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,181
I can't never forget that, dad.

128
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:26,034
The music inside me is
also because of you.

129
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,847
Sing one Tamil song with
this same feel.

130
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,006
Really?
- Yes.

131
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,820
You'll always be with mum.

132
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,186
You loved her madly.

133
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:00,393
Mum too.

134
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,234
I too wanted to love a girl
like that.

135
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:06,667
I still remember.

136
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:20,411
You are saying you'll pass.

137
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:22,475
We will see.

138
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,985
You don't Smoke, right?

139
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,761
No, dad.
I've never touched it.

140
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,967
Why are you smoking then?

141
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,832
This has become a habit since
college time.

142
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,199
I can't let it go.
Go.

143
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:44,639
What exam?

144
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,570
I saw you talking to some girls
on the street.

145
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:52,916
Don't do it!
- I asked for question paper..

146
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,417
Your house may be small
but it's nice.

147
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,385
Bring them home and talk.

148
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,318
Looks like you have brought
them all!

149
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,620
Ya, you are the one told, right?

150
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,164
Your dad is very cool.

151
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,366
It's friendship.
Aarthi is just my friend.

152
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:17,972
But I'll ask her to tie
'Rakhi' for you.

153
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:19,138
Stop!

154
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,010
If you are Aarthi's friend,
does that mean you are a big shot?

155
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,513
Are you walking around proudly?

156
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,046
Will she only talks to you?

157
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,051
I don't want to see you
talking to her anymore.

158
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:33,789
Go from here.
Go.

159
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,561
I want to beat him at Ieast once.

160
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,394
You saw his body, right?
He's taller than you some more.

161
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:45,628
You will be gone then!

162
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,900
We can even escape after
we beat him.

163
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,802
We only have bicycle.
He has Yamaha bike.

164
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,184
I should have hit his left hand and
punched him.

165
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:06,585
Punch his face and get down.

166
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,957
Block him and...

167
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,500
What is this?

168
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:23,706
What happened?

169
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,636
Your girlfriend didn't do this, right?

170
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:29,839
No, dad.

171
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:31,979
What is the problem?

172
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:33,943
I talked to a girl.

173
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:36,577
She is his, it seems.
He hit me.

174
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:37,981
Did you hit him back?

175
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:40,517
He's elder than me, dad.
- so?

176
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,960
You have worked out this, right!

177
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:44,359
For what?

178
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,733
You are my hero, dad.

179
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,633
Please don't do it, buddy!

180
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,071
Just one hit.
- Surya!

181
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,236
Don't know what is going
to happen!

182
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,378
What?

183
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,187
He hit me the other day.
That's why I hit him back.

184
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:11,948
It's between me and him.
- Move aside!

185
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:14,621
How dare you!

186
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,959
Come and hit me!
What are you looking there?

187
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,236
Enough!

188
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:40,712
Hit him!
Hit him!

189
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,724
You are such an useless
small boy!

190
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:57,960
I will kill you.

191
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,727
I will talk to Aarthi.

192
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:02,832
I will talk till I die.

193
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:04,764
Don't think I will stop talking to her
cause I'm scared of you.

194
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,143
Now also,
I will go to her house.

195
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,179
She'll put medicine for all
this wounds.

196
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:09,973
Get on the bicycle!

197
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,106
Sympathy will worked out!
Thanks a lot.

198
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,628
Take care of your health.

199
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,564
Hostel life will be different.

200
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,866
Be a good boy!
Don't change a lot.

201
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:30,564
I didn't have money. That's why
I had to borrow them for your admission.

202
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:33,002
I'm telling you this because l
didn't want you to worry.

203
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,009
Take this.
I'll send you money every month.

204
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,613
Write letter to me.
Write daily.

205
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,585
It will be nice to read them
after 10 years.

206
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,453
I'm saying that you are no more
under my shadow.

207
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:06,070
I still remember you left me
at college and walked away.

208
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,045
I remembered everything
as if it happened yesterday.

209
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,315
Sir, Sir.
I don't want, sir.

210
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:16,515
It's either you smoke or
shave your moustache.

211
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:17,416
Which one is convenient?

212
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,022
Be like this.
You don't need moustache.

213
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:22,390
You are still ok.
I was asked to bald my hair.

214
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,026
The letters that you wrote for me
when I was in college.

215
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,427
Your words..

216
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,956
Things that you told me.

217
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:43,809
Surya!

218
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:46,146
You are sitting at the
last bench in 2nd year.

219
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,649
What else I can expect from you?

220
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,462
What?
What you will do?

221
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,768
It doesn't mean you can do
anything if you're a Senior!

222
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:11,937
Get lost!

223
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:29,391
I enjoyed my college life.

224
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,089
I didn't study properly, dad.

225
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:34,829
But I tried for the both of you.

226
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,827
Hei, Sathish!
You don't leave Mala.

227
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,505
Make sure you all collect
Rs500 from Bai.

228
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:05,923
Sathish, don't miss your last paper!

229
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:07,496
Try to pass that paper.

230
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:08,792
If not, you must retake it
in September.

231
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,126
I will come for sure.

232
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,407
On my way to Madras
after college is over,

233
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:27,782
On that night,

234
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,943
I realised What Was Iove.

235
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,288
When you met mum for
the first time,

236
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,584
I realised how was your feeling.

237
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,609
The moment I saw her,
I thought of mum, dad.

238
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:11,184
Mom, I thought you were the
most beautiful lady in the world.

239
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:13,793
But now, there is another girl
who are more beautiful than you.

240
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:37,186
What time we will reach, sir?
- 6.30pm.

241
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:48,543
I studied in RAC Trichi.

242
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,480
I've completed my final year.
Going home now.

243
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,217
We have been in the same place for 4 years
but I've never seen her once also.

244
00:39:58,362 --> 00:39:59,397
What were you doing, Surya?

245
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,194
I studied in Moogambikai College.

246
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,028
I've written my final year's exam.

247
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:06,461
I think I'II complete it.

248
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:08,028
I will only know that once
my results are out.

249
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,573
That's why I'm still keeping my books.

250
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,066
I'm going home too.

251
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,234
I've seen you before.

252
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:17,607
You came to my college for
cultural competition.

253
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:28,651
But I've never seen before.

254
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,002
What is this?

255
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:40,731
Nothing.

256
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:43,106
You are doing like this.
You are doing like that.

257
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:45,640
Are you breathing heavily?

258
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:48,839
Yes, I am.

259
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,415
It's because of you.

260
00:40:58,589 --> 00:40:59,851
Are you trying to flirt with me?

261
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:04,255
No, I'm telling the truth.

262
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,268
I can't sit.

263
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:28,340
Did you get it?

264
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:31,922
You are smoking, right?

265
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,622
I don't know whether it's right or wrong
when come to think about it now.

266
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,628
You expressed your love to mum
when you met her, right!

267
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,861
That was the only thing was
running in my heart.

268
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:49,463
Tell her you like her.

269
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,403
Ya, I told.

270
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,103
That's how I felt when I saw your mum.

271
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:57,779
I tell her the truth.

272
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,508
After that only,

273
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,038
Don't look down upon me!

274
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,245
I'm telling the truth.

275
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,310
The moment I saw you,

276
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,315
Girls in white dress.

277
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,153
How you read 'Godfather' before?

278
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:43,951
Like the thunder bolt in that story.

279
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:46,391
Like when my dad met my mum.

280
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,428
Everything in one second.

281
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,732
It Was nice.

282
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:13,911
I've never behave Iike this before.

283
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,043
I never had this much of guts.

284
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:17,278
Didn't even know I had it.

285
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:21,622
I've never seen a woman
like you before.

286
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,395
That's why I need to tell this.

287
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:36,236
What you expect me to say now?

288
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:42,240
I don't believe in love at 1st sight.

289
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:45,541
You look good.

290
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,483
I liked what ever things that you did.

291
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:52,320
I've seen you before so
I talked to you.

292
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:56,690
But there is no love.

293
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,328
I think we must get to know
each other well for that.

294
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,263
We must understand each other.

295
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,028
I don't know..
- Let's do it then.

296
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:08,530
Let's get to know each other.

297
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:10,967
It's not that easy.

298
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,214
I understand.
I don't need anything.

299
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,280
Just answer to three questions.

300
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:29,114
Are you married?

301
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:33,852
Would be?
Engaged to someone?

302
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:39,296
Do you love anyone?
- No.

303
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:40,929
That's enough.

304
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,431
No matter where you are,
I'll come looking for you.

305
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:53,313
Go and sleep.

306
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,940
I've made you to stay awake
for a long time.

307
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:00,753
I didn't know what else
I expected her to say!

308
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:02,620
But I told.

309
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:19,105
Normally, some old songs will be
playing in my heart.

310
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,443
But the moment I saw her,
first time in life,

311
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:26,216
A new song,
my first own composition, dad.

312
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:26,580
A new song,
my first own composition, dad.

313
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,004
You are the raindrops that
rains in my heart.

314
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,815
Lotus that sinks in water.

315
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:36,576
The sudden changes in the sky.

316
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,984
Girl, it's your responsible.

317
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:50,922
A dream on that day,

318
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:52,862
I still remember it till today, dad.

319
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:09,983
I don't have anything.

320
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:11,188
I will give you some how.

321
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:12,761
End of the month,
I will come and give.

322
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:14,389
It has been 3 months, Krishnan.

323
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,190
Please don't talk loud.
My son is inside.

324
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:18,631
You know about me, right?
- so, you are asking me to leave?

325
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,436
Please don't borrow money
from the Seth anymore.

326
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:26,209
We will handle it.

327
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:27,969
How much you borrowed from him?

328
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,848
First, we settle his money.

329
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,683
Mum, the balance LlC
housing loan is a lot, right?

330
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:41,180
That want also we will start
to pay monthly.

331
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:45,517
Then, we must redeem
mum's jewellary.

332
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,097
Our house project is stopped
half way, right?

333
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,165
We must start the project again.

334
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:55,801
That's all, right?

335
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,440
You have said it easily.

336
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:00,770
But I've spent 15 years in these.

337
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,047
How come you are saying it
so easily?

338
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,979
How we can pay all
our debt so fast?

339
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,842
It will happen.
You will see.

340
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,218
You have worked very hard
all this while, dad.

341
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,222
That is enough.

342
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,196
You have never sit on the chair
with your leg crossed.

343
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:22,622
And you have taught us that it is wrong.

344
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,000
But I tell you now.

345
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:25,567
The time has come for all that.

346
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:29,363
sit relax on the chair
with your leg crossed.

347
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:33,242
Get your retirement, dad.

348
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:37,574
The money that you'll get, transfer them
into both of your accounts.

349
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,443
That money is only for both of you.

350
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:49,014
I don't like to see dad working
so hard like this.

351
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:53,291
What, mum?

352
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:55,758
I've told him this many times.

353
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:57,432
But this is your dad's decision.

354
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:00,226
Your children have grown up.

355
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:04,374
Yesterday, we talked about
the honeymoon.

356
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:05,739
I think we must go for it.

357
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:09,602
I wanted to fix everything
after my studies.

358
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:11,976
I decided that you should not
suffer anymore, dad.

359
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:18,749
I wanted to bring Meghna
too to our home.

360
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,356
What are you doing here?

361
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:30,359
I told you I'll come, right?

362
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:33,099
This one.

363
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:34,828
Don't worry.
I won't sing all.

364
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,629
Just in case if you have
forgotten me.

365
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,365
That's why for you to
remember me,

366
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,772
I brought the same guitar,
wearing the same t-shirt and jean.

367
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:42,677
Does it look like a bit over?

368
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,408
What if someone else opened
the door means?

369
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:47,777
My dad dislikes all this.

370
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:51,210
That's right.
A dad should be like that.

371
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:54,113
But I know he's not at home now.

372
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:56,481
I saw your parents going out.

373
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:00,419
No one else is at home, right?

374
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:02,588
What about brother?
Don't have, right?

375
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:08,836
Don't laugh like that, Meghna.

376
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,438
I thought you have forgotten me.

377
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:15,777
I didn't thought you'll come again.

378
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:17,602
What you want?

379
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:23,784
Want to get to know you.

380
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:25,819
So, I tried to get into that effort.

381
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:40,193
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow?

382
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:44,164
Now, I can't.
Tomorrow is also impossible.

383
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:46,671
Definitely, I can't.
I've a lots of work to do.

384
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:48,274
In one Week time,

385
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:52,513
It's not easy to meet outside easily.

386
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:54,511
My dad is very strict.

387
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:01,785
You said you're going out of town.
To Trichi?

388
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,797
For holiday, isn't it?

389
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:10,763
No, to study.

390
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:19,198
The one that they will
teach you for 2 years.

391
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:27,245
You have just sat for your
final year's exam.

392
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,817
So fast you are going abroad?

393
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:30,783
What if you fail in any of
the subject?

394
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,620
Don't tell me you will
come back from there?

395
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:35,020
They won't take you there
without your mark sheet.

396
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:36,750
My course is starting in
August only.

397
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,987
But I'm going to do a project
before that.

398
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:47,064
There's no chance for me to fail.

399
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:01,649
One week means?

400
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:07,956
Do you really have to go?

401
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:11,984
This is my ambition,
my dad's dream.

402
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,727
Not only that.
I plan to settle there after my studies.

403
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:22,162
How if all the intelligence
study and work there means?

404
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:25,574
You will study, work and
pay tax there.

405
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:26,640
That country will be good.

406
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:29,472
Why don't you study, work
and pay tax here?

407
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:30,806
Our country will be better.

408
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:33,448
I will live happily too, right!

409
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,585
You should have told me
about this that day itself.

410
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:41,388
I wouldn't have wasted these 5 days.

411
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:44,421
I would have come the next day
itself with my guitar.

412
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:47,996
That's why!
We shouldn't be decent at all.

413
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:01,042
I want to spend my life with you.

414
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:12,214
How you could love someone
at first sight?

415
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:13,847
I don't understand.

416
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:19,927
So, it's just lust.

417
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:30,433
After that, my parents must
like you.

418
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:35,475
He will ask.

419
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:37,947
What is his job?
What he have studied?

420
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:39,370
Is he a good guy?

421
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:42,275
Does he earns a lot?

422
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:46,380
Will he take care of you?
Will he die for you?

423
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:50,324
He must say that you are
the right guy.

424
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,187
Same goes in your house, right?

425
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:55,826
Your mum must also say that
I'm the right girl, right?

426
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:12,880
Which university in America?

427
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,213
I will come.

428
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,453
Meghna.
That is a nice name.

429
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,082
Is it a tragedy?

430
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,995
You are my son, what!

431
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:30,521
No, dad.

432
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,831
She's going, dad.

433
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:34,335
You go too.

434
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:36,798
America is just here.

435
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,434
Go and bring her back.

436
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:40,468
What's wrong with this?

437
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:43,943
I used your room when
you are not around.

438
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:44,944
Let me take my book.

439
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,942
You were my inspiration in every
important situation in my life.

440
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:53,822
You are the one taught me that
America is very nearby.

441
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:56,981
I must solve all the problem at home.

442
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,893
When I thought of getting to know Meghna
in that one week time,

443
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:02,825
I still remember that.

444
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:04,030
The next day,

445
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:05,495
You had a heart attack.

446
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,205
What happened?
- Mum!

447
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:12,205
Nothing.

448
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:14,999
All because of this cigarette.

449
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:17,806
I told him in the morning also
not to smoke a lot.

450
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:20,505
He should have stopped smoking.
- Where were both of you that time?

451
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:22,248
We were in Uncle Morris's house.

452
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:25,115
He hold his head and sat.
Suddenly, he fell down.

453
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:26,653
What did the doctor said?
How is he now?

454
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:27,653
He's ok now.

455
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:52,413
I couldn't see you lying
on the hospital bed, dad.

456
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:55,908
I still remember.

457
01:00:56,919 --> 01:00:58,443
I was with you for one whole week.

458
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:00,181
I have forgotten Meghna.

459
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:02,348
But I know that she must
have left already.

460
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:05,217
Nothing was important to me
except you, dad.

461
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:18,539
Come, Sir.

462
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:20,802
It Iooks neat.

463
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:25,638
How much is the rent?
- Rs7,000, Sir.

464
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,180
Water supply is ok.

465
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:31,877
What is the plan?

466
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:39,651
We have done that project in college.

467
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:42,264
I did that project.
- Okay!

468
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:45,393
I was the one who typed it.
I'm the one who know the people in that
company.

469
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:48,103
We must start again our
house project.

470
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:51,536
I want you and mum to stay
in your own home.

471
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:53,432
That was the only thing was
in my heart.

472
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:55,304
I've gained my responsibility.

473
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:57,143
It started to work.

474
01:01:57,513 --> 01:01:59,037
It's all because of you, dad.

475
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:00,616
For you.

476
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,420
Why are you giving me
the businessman feel?

477
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:16,823
Don't ask that!

478
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:27,174
I'm going to sing a Song from
my own composition.

479
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:37,377
Will the loan get Sanctioned?

480
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:38,880
Yes, it will.

481
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:41,851
Take it.

482
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:44,417
Looks like a lot of work
need to be done.

483
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,494
Ya, it has been stopped

484
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:57,934
If we take this hall out,
we will get the space.

485
01:02:58,074 --> 01:02:58,938
Everything is ok.

486
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:02,010
I want a bar, a mini one
in a corner.

487
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:02,975
Darling, you come.

488
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:04,602
Tell where shall we put it.
- Very important now.

489
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:08,709
Only painting work is balance.

490
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:10,011
Will take another week, right?
- It's nice.

491
01:03:10,653 --> 01:03:11,642
It looks nice right, mum!

492
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:27,967
Dad, wait.

493
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:31,535
We always share one pillow.

494
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:41,813
After that,
once again Meghna.

495
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:45,682
Don't you think this is too much?

496
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:47,612
They are going to hold your passport.

497
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:50,223
Because you are candidate
without any eligibility.

498
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:54,923
You never thought about this
all this while?

499
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:57,166
You never even say a word
about that girl.

500
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,933
Why now suddenly?

501
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:02,335
What, buddy?

502
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:04,236
Buddy!

503
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:08,705
Ya, right.
- I couldn't forget her, buddy.

504
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:10,645
Let's see first whether I'm
getting visa or not.

505
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:55,648
What sing is this?

506
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:57,190
It's nice.
From which movie?

507
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:59,226
What?
This is my own composition.

508
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:00,620
Has not released in any movie.

509
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:02,788
It will take another 10 to 15 years
for this kind of tune to come.

510
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:05,129
Don't talk in ghetto just
because you got the visa.

511
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:08,726
Before they realise their mistake,
you better go and come back soon from
America.

512
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:10,998
Mum, you tell me.
Shall I go to America?

513
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,102
Go and come.
Stay happy.

514
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:21,411
Go.
Go and bring her back.

515
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:30,423
I didn't go there neither to
work nor to study.

516
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:33,158
You sent me there for my love.

517
01:05:53,749 --> 01:05:55,046
No matter where you are,
I will come looking for you.

518
01:08:37,813 --> 01:08:39,440
Who are you?
Surya?

519
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:41,174
Why did you came?
Have I seen you before?

520
01:08:41,317 --> 01:08:42,181
I don't Iike all this.

521
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,834
Are you studying in Berkeley University?

522
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:41,568
When did you joined?

523
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:43,577
No chance.

524
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:48,207
I haven't pass one paper
in my final year.

525
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,041
I just retake that paper.

526
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,989
This time also,
it won't exceed 1 0 marks.

527
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:57,416
Must retake again.
Maybe in April or September.

528
01:09:57,826 --> 01:10:01,694
Even if I get 1st class,
I won't be studying here.

529
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:02,694
Then,

530
01:10:06,635 --> 01:10:07,624
I came to see you.

531
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:16,009
Come.

532
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,145
Is this your house?
- Ya, I live here.

533
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:32,618
For students stay outside
the university.

534
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:36,927
Are you staying in hotel?

535
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,398
Ya, at University Avenue.

536
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:43,004
After checked in there,
I was searching for you the whole university.

537
01:10:43,138 --> 01:10:44,605
Then, I found you.

538
01:10:49,778 --> 01:10:51,643
Bring your bag.
Come and stay here.

539
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,647
It's only US$40.
- I'll be in college the whole day..

540
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:03,013
You can stay here.

541
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:05,983
In your room.
It won't be nice.

542
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:09,655
I still remember talking to you
in the phone from there.

543
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:11,626
I will feel like telling you
everything.

544
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:13,299
And I will tell.

545
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:14,868
I stayed in a motel last night.

546
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:19,474
She asked me to stay
with her in her room.

547
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:21,832
Then, you better talk to your mom.

548
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:24,036
What he's saying?
- He's staying with the girl, it seems.

549
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:26,241
Give it to me.

550
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,879
Surya, what daddy is saying?

551
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,971
Next state like Bombay
or Kerala is still ok.

552
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:55,102
Will anyone come this far?

553
01:11:56,545 --> 01:12:00,413
I didn't come neither to impress you
nor to give impact to you.

554
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:01,950
It's very selfish.

555
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:04,052
I came to see you and
to be with you.

556
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:09,784
Do you know, dad?
I lived with her for 90 days.

557
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:14,194
It was like an llayaraja's song, dad.

558
01:18:06,915 --> 01:18:08,507
I want to live my life with you.

559
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:13,616
I like you and my dad
will like you a lot too.

560
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:20,124
Job, education.
He won't ask anything.

561
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,393
He knows that you are
a good guy.

562
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:30,796
He knows that you will
take care of me well.

563
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:34,398
He knows that you will die for me.

564
01:18:36,845 --> 01:18:40,542
He will say that you are
the right guy.

565
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:47,147
Will your mum say that
I'm the right girl for you?

566
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:25,090
There's nothing beautiful here
except for you and this bridge.

567
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:30,457
This is for you.

568
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:41,865
What?

569
01:20:42,437 --> 01:20:45,668
I want to stay at the motel
beside this.

570
01:20:45,974 --> 01:20:48,670
I'll stay there tonight.
That will be right.

571
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:51,267
After your class over.

572
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:58,741
What?
No, you can stay here.

573
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:09,687
What's the problem?

574
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:13,933
You are the problem.

575
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:17,237
You made me stand upside down.

576
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:21,934
Not because it's cold.

577
01:21:23,478 --> 01:21:24,809
I feel so confused.

578
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:27,879
Since when?

579
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:33,587
Since I kissed you.

580
01:21:40,528 --> 01:21:41,517
Don't torture me!

581
01:21:42,697 --> 01:21:45,495
You stay there and
I will sleep in this corner.

582
01:22:27,642 --> 01:22:30,475
She told she'll marry me.

583
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:32,110
She got the girl.

584
01:22:33,048 --> 01:22:34,913
She told me yesterday evening.

585
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:38,016
I told her that we can get
married in 4 years time.

586
01:22:38,153 --> 01:22:39,381
Yes, yes.

587
01:22:39,521 --> 01:22:40,385
Must be like that.

588
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:42,787
Be happy.

589
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:43,982
Your mum is here.
I'll give the phone to her.

590
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:48,589
You are getting married here, right?

591
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:51,689
When are you coming back?

592
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:54,267
Got an Oklahoma trip in 3 days.

593
01:22:54,402 --> 01:22:56,632
She's going there for a
project matter.

594
01:22:57,172 --> 01:22:59,231
I will go there too and then
I will come back.

595
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:00,398
You come with me.

596
01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:02,973
My friends are there.

597
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:07,176
You will have lots of work there.
You'll be busy for 2 days.

598
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:10,542
If I sit in the bus,
I'll think about you and come.

599
01:23:10,885 --> 01:23:12,284
I can at least visit all the
places here.

600
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:13,910
It is just 2 days.
I will come.

601
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:19,583
I've told lot about you and mum
to Meghna.

602
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:21,688
I Ioved her.

603
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:53,114
There is one thing that l
didn't tell you, dad.

604
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:56,786
When the Federal Building blasted
in Oklahoma,

605
01:24:57,258 --> 01:24:59,158
I was just walking 200m away.

606
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:02,958
If I reached there 1 0 minutes earlier,
I would have died on that day.

607
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,181
Yes, I saw the news in BBC.

608
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:03,042
She was in that building.

609
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:09,216
Nothing happened, right?
What happened?

610
01:27:15,964 --> 01:27:16,794
How do you know that?

611
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:18,460
Were you there that time?

612
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,761
Did you saw her, Surya?

613
01:27:21,169 --> 01:27:26,038
She died on the way
to the hospital.

614
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:29,169
I don't knoWwhat to do, dad.

615
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:36,907
We were like you and mum.

616
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:39,516
What happened?

617
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:56,970
I can't take it, dad.

618
01:28:02,510 --> 01:28:05,775
Surya, were you there at that time?

619
01:28:06,347 --> 01:28:07,541
Are you ok?

620
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:09,208
Let me talk.

621
01:28:09,584 --> 01:28:11,142
Surya, talk to me.

622
01:28:11,986 --> 01:28:14,454
You come back to me immediately.

623
01:28:15,323 --> 01:28:16,153
He's crying.

624
01:28:16,591 --> 01:28:17,922
Why he's not talking to me?
- I can't hear.

625
01:28:22,597 --> 01:28:24,326
I didn't want you to know
my pain, dad.

626
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:26,596
But to whom else I can cry to?

627
01:28:27,268 --> 01:28:28,667
On whose shoulder I can lean?

628
01:29:22,423 --> 01:29:26,257
I like you and my dad
will like you too.

629
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:28,954
He knows that you are
a good guy.

630
01:29:30,231 --> 01:29:31,994
He knows that you will
take care of me well.

631
01:29:33,835 --> 01:29:35,530
He knows that you'll die
for me.

632
01:30:27,855 --> 01:30:29,322
I didn't tell you this too, dad.

633
01:30:29,891 --> 01:30:32,382
I went to all the place that
Meghna and I went.

634
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:37,095
Suddenly, I thought of just go
and look for her.

635
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:39,560
I couldn't believe that she is
no more alive.

636
01:30:40,668 --> 01:30:42,431
I thought of not returning to you.

637
01:30:43,137 --> 01:30:44,832
Thought of going somewhere else.

638
01:31:01,923 --> 01:31:03,220
Why did you left us and go?

639
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:09,755
Everything that happened in my life
is in front of my eyes now.

640
01:31:10,598 --> 01:31:12,122
Once I returned from America,

641
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:16,596
I wanted to tell about Meghna and cry
to you, mum and Shreya.

642
01:31:17,505 --> 01:31:20,406
I thought everything will be fine
if I hug you means, dad.

643
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:22,633
I came back.

644
01:32:04,986 --> 01:32:05,975
Shankar Menon.

645
01:32:08,122 --> 01:32:10,920
When talking to him,
it reminds me of you, dad.

646
01:32:11,893 --> 01:32:14,555
He has a style like you.

647
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:17,254
I felt like talking to him.

648
01:32:17,865 --> 01:32:18,923
I told him everything.

649
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:23,993
Must be a lot.

650
01:32:26,073 --> 01:32:28,064
Keep all the memories inside.

651
01:32:28,276 --> 01:32:29,174
It Will be difficult.

652
01:32:30,878 --> 01:32:33,972
But only those memories will bring
your strength out.

653
01:32:34,415 --> 01:32:35,382
Get hold of it.

654
01:32:46,327 --> 01:32:47,487
No, Surya.
It's ok.

655
01:32:49,363 --> 01:32:50,431
Don't get me wrong.

656
01:32:50,431 --> 01:32:51,830
If you want to be free,
I'll go back there.

657
01:32:58,005 --> 01:32:59,973
My father passed away
a year ago.

658
01:33:00,141 --> 01:33:01,342
I was broken.

659
01:33:01,342 --> 01:33:03,276
But I have a son.

660
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:05,376
He is 5 years old.

661
01:33:05,813 --> 01:33:09,146
The way he talked and all the
little things that he does,

662
01:33:09,283 --> 01:33:11,808
Made me to came through that.

663
01:33:11,953 --> 01:33:13,784
You must have anything
like that, Surya.

664
01:33:17,992 --> 01:33:19,289
I've told you before.

665
01:33:21,662 --> 01:33:23,527
Surya, come.

666
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:34,298
It was very sad.

667
01:33:35,476 --> 01:33:36,408
Never mind, dad.

668
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:47,210
Come.
Sit down.

669
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:52,859
You don't worry.
We are here for you.

670
01:33:54,061 --> 01:33:55,995
The days I was silent.

671
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:57,825
You were with me, dad.

672
01:34:00,201 --> 01:34:01,133
How are you?

673
01:34:03,504 --> 01:34:05,404
Why are you just sitting
at home?

674
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,731
You know that your office is
going well, right?

675
01:34:09,143 --> 01:34:10,132
Go and visit everyone and come.

676
01:34:20,388 --> 01:34:22,754
The days I was only with my bike.

677
01:34:48,282 --> 01:34:49,271
Priya!

678
01:34:50,184 --> 01:34:51,811
The days I started to get to
know her.

679
01:35:17,845 --> 01:35:18,812
Why now?

680
01:35:18,946 --> 01:35:20,208
Why you stopped half way?

681
01:35:32,793 --> 01:35:34,090
I'm having a small party at home.

682
01:35:38,199 --> 01:35:39,894
Shreya is coming.
I want you to come too.

683
01:35:41,869 --> 01:35:42,801
I will see hoW.

684
01:36:10,264 --> 01:36:11,196
What are you laughing at?

685
01:36:12,867 --> 01:36:15,392
The days I tried to forget Meghna.

686
01:36:17,304 --> 01:36:19,101
I bought a book for you.

687
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:20,372
I want you to read.

688
01:36:22,309 --> 01:36:24,709
But, I paid for that.
- I'll return your money.

689
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:34,819
She told me goodbye and
walked away.

690
01:36:35,589 --> 01:36:36,783
She didn't turn and looked.

691
01:36:38,025 --> 01:36:39,583
I felt one kind.

692
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:43,161
Disturbed feeling for 10 minutes.

693
01:36:43,497 --> 01:36:44,429
Inside me.

694
01:36:48,502 --> 01:36:50,333
I thought I'll never see her
after that.

695
01:36:54,108 --> 01:36:56,770
The pain came again.
Suddenly.

696
01:36:57,711 --> 01:36:58,837
I couldn't take it.

697
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:01,841
I couldn't forget Meghna.

698
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:04,250
The pain did not go.

699
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,039
The alcohol bottle that
you hid, dad.

700
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:07,272
Horrible days that I want to forget
in my life.

701
01:38:08,649 --> 01:38:09,911
She came, buddy.

702
01:38:10,751 --> 01:38:12,742
Into my life by a train.

703
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:13,751
Ok, buddy.

704
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:20,318
They carried her in a stretcher.

705
01:38:22,596 --> 01:38:24,689
It was like they carried my
dream away.

706
01:38:31,205 --> 01:38:32,137
What he thinks?
- You keep quiet!

707
01:38:32,273 --> 01:38:33,399
If he does like this, we don't sit
with him anymore.

708
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:35,132
Let's go from here.
What do you think you're doing?

709
01:38:35,276 --> 01:38:36,140
Leave it.
Sit down.

710
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:38,810
She's Anjalai, buddy.

711
01:38:45,352 --> 01:38:47,445
She's my Anjalai.
- Ok, buddy.

712
01:38:51,492 --> 01:38:52,584
She's my Megalai.

713
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:56,919
She's my Aandal, buddy.

714
01:39:01,068 --> 01:39:03,127
What, Surya?

715
01:39:09,209 --> 01:39:11,268
This is called as the death music.

716
01:39:12,613 --> 01:39:13,739
He has gone crazy.

717
01:39:14,014 --> 01:39:16,141
I think we must carry him home.

718
01:39:17,251 --> 01:39:19,014
You get ready.
- He's dancing steadily.

719
01:40:31,825 --> 01:40:33,417
Surya, get up!

720
01:44:37,037 --> 01:44:38,971
Dad, you told me not to smoke.

721
01:44:39,172 --> 01:44:42,664
But I went beyond that.

722
01:44:53,220 --> 01:44:54,380
Come after 10 minutes.

723
01:44:55,122 --> 01:44:56,111
What's in your hand, Surya?

724
01:44:59,226 --> 01:45:00,784
I want to talk to you some more.

725
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:05,330
Take your hand off!

726
01:45:10,537 --> 01:45:12,004
I wanted to talk to you.

727
01:45:12,673 --> 01:45:14,231
It's my fault for not talking
to you earlier.

728
01:45:22,349 --> 01:45:23,577
What's all this, Surya?

729
01:45:24,751 --> 01:45:26,218
What happen to you?
- I can't be without all that.

730
01:45:26,353 --> 01:45:27,217
I want that.

731
01:45:27,888 --> 01:45:28,786
You won't understand.

732
01:45:31,325 --> 01:45:32,257
I am here for you.

733
01:45:35,529 --> 01:45:37,588
I won't let you do all this.
- Do you know how hard to get this?

734
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:40,960
Let's sit and talk, Surya.

735
01:45:41,101 --> 01:45:41,829
You don't need all this.

736
01:45:41,968 --> 01:45:43,799
I asked you to go out...
I went to hit you.

737
01:45:44,304 --> 01:45:45,430
I still remember.

738
01:45:48,875 --> 01:45:49,842
It's nothing.

739
01:45:54,581 --> 01:45:58,039
I can't live without this...
You know how hard for me to get it?

740
01:45:58,185 --> 01:46:01,518
He split it.
- It's gone now.

741
01:46:03,390 --> 01:46:05,153
I can't do anything without this.

742
01:46:06,526 --> 01:46:07,754
I can't talk, I can't laugh.

743
01:46:07,894 --> 01:46:08,758
I can't sit, I can't stand.

744
01:46:08,895 --> 01:46:09,759
I can't sing, I can't forget.

745
01:46:09,896 --> 01:46:11,386
I can't do anything, mum.

746
01:46:13,767 --> 01:46:16,065
I've been doing drugs
for 3 months, mum.

747
01:46:16,203 --> 01:46:18,535
I'm still alive because of this or
I'm already dead by now.

748
01:46:24,578 --> 01:46:26,102
I want this!

749
01:46:30,450 --> 01:46:31,781
Both of you are living happily, right?

750
01:46:32,119 --> 01:46:33,518
Both of you won't understand this!

751
01:46:35,389 --> 01:46:36,413
Get out!

752
01:46:38,959 --> 01:46:40,187
I'm going out.

753
01:46:40,527 --> 01:46:42,722
I won't be back tonight.
- No, I won't let you go anywhere.

754
01:46:45,766 --> 01:46:46,960
Listen to us!

755
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:48,633
Let me go.

756
01:46:50,470 --> 01:46:51,835
You don't need this!

757
01:46:53,540 --> 01:46:56,008
Let me go!
Let me go, mum!

758
01:46:56,143 --> 01:46:57,201
Or I will die.

759
01:46:57,344 --> 01:46:59,312
You don't need this.

760
01:46:59,446 --> 01:47:01,038
I'm here for you.
Your dad is here for you too.

761
01:47:19,599 --> 01:47:21,362
Don't think I'm comparing
you badly.

762
01:47:22,636 --> 01:47:25,196
Do you still remember cricket
match on your tenth standard?

763
01:47:26,606 --> 01:47:29,404
You got scolded.

764
01:47:30,343 --> 01:47:32,971
You came out so
angrily and cried.

765
01:47:33,713 --> 01:47:34,702
shouted.

766
01:47:37,884 --> 01:47:39,476
Then, came your turn to ball.

767
01:47:40,086 --> 01:47:41,178
You threw the ball fiercely.

768
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:47,992
You changed your
angriness into a positive energy.

769
01:47:48,395 --> 01:47:50,260
As now, you should do that too.

770
01:47:50,397 --> 01:47:54,094
Everything like your anger, disappointments
should be changed into a positive energy.

771
01:47:55,535 --> 01:47:57,025
Get your guitar and go out.

772
01:47:58,271 --> 01:47:59,238
Make everyone happy.

773
01:47:59,372 --> 01:48:00,464
Whatever happens..

774
01:48:06,580 --> 01:48:11,017
I still remember all the
things you said to me, dad.

775
01:48:12,152 --> 01:48:16,054
Daddy, you are the one who
rescued me from that dilemma.

776
01:48:43,917 --> 01:48:44,885
Shreya, where to?

777
01:48:44,885 --> 01:48:46,045
Mum, I'll go and see him.

778
01:49:00,467 --> 01:49:01,627
It's hurting!

779
01:49:17,584 --> 01:49:19,848
I'll pack your pants
and shirts in a bag.

780
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:21,914
Why don't you go
and visit anywhere?

781
01:49:23,924 --> 01:49:25,448
But you must come back to me!

782
01:49:26,259 --> 01:49:27,487
Leave everything behind
and come.

783
01:49:27,928 --> 01:49:28,952
Will you go?

784
01:49:34,768 --> 01:49:36,531
Both of you trusted me that much.

785
01:49:37,504 --> 01:49:39,062
And know I'll be back to
both of you!

786
01:49:39,973 --> 01:49:41,167
Both of you send me.

787
01:49:54,421 --> 01:49:56,719
Kashmir.
Srinagar.

788
01:49:58,224 --> 01:50:00,522
The days I seek my inner self.

789
01:51:19,506 --> 01:51:21,872
Shankar Menon, once
again appears in my life.

790
01:51:22,575 --> 01:51:26,011
I got to know that his son was kidnapped
when I was in Srinagar.

791
01:51:26,613 --> 01:51:29,173
I left Srinagar and came to Delhi.

792
01:52:04,584 --> 01:52:06,779
Even you asked me, dad
why I went there.

793
01:52:07,020 --> 01:52:08,078
But I don't know why.

794
01:52:08,221 --> 01:52:11,281
I felt like to accompany
him when he's in trouble.

795
01:52:16,629 --> 01:52:18,927
No, I think for sure that
I am disturbing you.

796
01:52:19,065 --> 01:52:20,794
I just came to talk for a
few minutes.

797
01:52:22,869 --> 01:52:23,836
He will be fine.

798
01:52:25,405 --> 01:52:26,838
I should have been more careful.

799
01:52:28,742 --> 01:52:31,302
He asked me to stay
with him in his house.

800
01:52:33,012 --> 01:52:34,741
Aditya, 5 years old.

801
01:52:35,815 --> 01:52:37,248
I realised hoW scared he Will be.

802
01:52:38,218 --> 01:52:40,118
I wondered why this kind of unhearted ppl
exist in this world.

803
01:52:41,154 --> 01:52:43,588
I remembered what had happen
to Meghna.

804
01:52:48,862 --> 01:52:52,059
I saw both of them were
suffering.

805
01:52:53,867 --> 01:52:56,392
The first call came
when I was around.

806
01:52:58,505 --> 01:53:00,063
They threatened for Rs2 Crores.

807
01:53:25,965 --> 01:53:27,694
I found out that the police did not
bothered about this matter.

808
01:53:28,201 --> 01:53:30,260
They didn't involved in this case seriously.

809
01:53:30,503 --> 01:53:33,961
I felt like wanted to do something.
I went into this matter.

810
01:53:38,878 --> 01:53:40,368
There is no place that l
didn't go in Delhi.

811
01:53:41,014 --> 01:53:43,380
I walked all over.
Went to every street.

812
01:53:44,184 --> 01:53:45,310
Talked to everyone.

813
01:53:45,652 --> 01:53:47,313
I talked to a thousand ppl.

814
01:53:49,656 --> 01:53:52,022
I went looking for Aditya.
An anger in me.

815
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:56,324
We can get anything if we
get on the street.

816
01:53:56,996 --> 01:53:58,122
Whatever we wants.

817
01:53:58,731 --> 01:54:01,256
I found out that we can get
all kind of information.

818
01:54:01,768 --> 01:54:03,167
I was Iike a mad man.

819
01:54:03,636 --> 01:54:05,069
A braveness built in me.

820
01:54:05,405 --> 01:54:08,238
That's the time I changed to
someone else, dad.

821
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:50,581
The only name that everyone
mentioned was 'Dabbu Malik'.

822
01:55:22,148 --> 01:55:25,447
I went into the effort.
Even pretended to sell girls.

823
01:56:48,201 --> 01:56:50,260
The only name that 'Dabbu Malik'
said was 'Ashat'.

824
01:57:30,443 --> 01:57:32,843
I wanted to know what
kind of life he's living.

825
01:57:33,646 --> 01:57:34,908
I followed him.

826
01:59:12,712 --> 01:59:15,943
The fierce brought me to Aditya.

827
02:00:36,095 --> 02:00:38,859
One will get the thing he wants
if he dares to get it.

828
02:00:39,465 --> 02:00:40,762
I learned that today, daddy.

829
02:01:52,138 --> 02:01:55,630
I didn't care about death that day.
But I saw it in front of my eyes.

830
02:07:21,233 --> 02:07:24,134
After that, happiness were everywhere.

831
02:07:24,637 --> 02:07:27,606
Till you fall sick, dad.

832
02:07:54,233 --> 02:07:55,757
Do it properly, Letchumi.

833
02:07:55,901 --> 02:07:57,562
Don't know how many evil eyes
had fall on him.

834
02:08:12,651 --> 02:08:14,846
After that, it was again Priya.

835
02:08:16,588 --> 02:08:17,577
I still remember.

836
02:08:18,691 --> 02:08:20,955
I stood one day and thought
about it.

837
02:08:22,161 --> 02:08:23,856
I know her since she Was

838
02:08:24,596 --> 02:08:26,120
She's Shreya's best friend.

839
02:08:26,899 --> 02:08:28,560
She will always be in our
house, dad.

840
02:08:30,035 --> 02:08:32,595
Both you and mum likes
her very much.

841
02:08:33,672 --> 02:08:36,140
You always tell me that she's
a nice girl.

842
02:09:09,274 --> 02:09:11,071
Do you watch lots of
MGR's movies?

843
02:09:13,912 --> 02:09:14,742
Why?

844
02:09:15,380 --> 02:09:17,109
You did sword fighting all.
How was that?

845
02:09:19,651 --> 02:09:21,312
What?
I'm seriously asking.

846
02:09:21,453 --> 02:09:22,317
Did you took training for that?

847
02:09:33,665 --> 02:09:36,065
I Iiked to be with her.

848
02:10:10,402 --> 02:10:12,632
I want to get down here.
Bugger!

849
02:10:19,178 --> 02:10:21,009
What?
What?

850
02:10:22,648 --> 02:10:23,478
Touch her.

851
02:10:23,682 --> 02:10:24,410
Let's go.

852
02:10:27,686 --> 02:10:28,414
Touch her now.

853
02:10:34,193 --> 02:10:35,558
Who do you think you are hitting?
- Surya, leave him.

854
02:10:35,861 --> 02:10:37,328
I'm Saying no, right?

855
02:10:38,363 --> 02:10:40,490
Have you gone mad?
I'm Saying no, right?

856
02:10:42,634 --> 02:10:44,795
This hit will remind you next time
before you touch any girls.

857
02:10:46,505 --> 02:10:48,564
If anything happen to him, means?
Everyone is looking at us.

858
02:10:49,408 --> 02:10:50,306
I'm going.

859
02:11:14,266 --> 02:11:17,235
I wanted her to be my
best friend only.

860
02:11:18,370 --> 02:11:20,133
Priya, shall we go?

861
02:11:27,646 --> 02:11:28,840
For a long time.

862
02:11:30,215 --> 02:11:32,479
When you were 17 and
I was 15,

863
02:11:33,051 --> 02:11:34,211
since that time.

864
02:11:38,457 --> 02:11:41,824
I met you first when I was

865
02:11:42,427 --> 02:11:43,985
May be since then also.

866
02:11:46,865 --> 02:11:48,298
No, it's ok.
You can go.

867
02:11:58,343 --> 02:11:59,935
One day, I came to tell you
about my love.

868
02:12:00,178 --> 02:12:03,705
But that was the day you told
about Meghna to everyone.

869
02:12:04,549 --> 02:12:05,811
so, I just kept quiet.

870
02:12:08,420 --> 02:12:10,911
I tried to forget you.

871
02:12:11,890 --> 02:12:12,754
I can't.

872
02:12:16,228 --> 02:12:18,492
Today, Meghna is not alive.

873
02:12:19,231 --> 02:12:20,789
I know you can't forget her.

874
02:12:23,869 --> 02:12:26,064
I'm not expecting anything from you.

875
02:12:29,041 --> 02:12:31,635
But there are such thing like
this in my heart,

876
02:12:32,110 --> 02:12:35,568
You must know that I love you.

877
02:12:36,481 --> 02:12:39,075
You must know that this is
not only friendship.

878
02:12:45,290 --> 02:12:48,817
My friends will ask me about us.

879
02:12:49,161 --> 02:12:50,560
I will tell them that we are
just friends.

880
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:58,566
I boy and a girl can never be
always friends, right?

881
02:13:01,239 --> 02:13:02,763
I didn't tell anything to Priya, dad.

882
02:13:03,675 --> 02:13:05,108
I couldn't say yes to her.

883
02:13:06,878 --> 02:13:08,038
It's so obvious.

884
02:13:08,380 --> 02:13:09,904
Both of you not talking to
each and other.

885
02:13:10,048 --> 02:13:10,742
No, daddy.

886
02:13:12,117 --> 02:13:15,416
She is a good girl.
say yes to her one day.

887
02:13:16,021 --> 02:13:17,545
Don't make her wait for
a long time.

888
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:37,365
They called me Surya s/O Krishnan
that day.

889
02:13:38,310 --> 02:13:40,870
I still had the pain of losing
Meghna.

890
02:13:41,346 --> 02:13:43,780
To get rid of that,
I went into the gym.

891
02:13:44,282 --> 02:13:46,273
Till now, I tell my juniors.

892
02:13:46,685 --> 02:13:48,084
Get your body ready.

893
02:13:48,453 --> 02:13:49,977
All the pain will go.

894
02:14:15,547 --> 02:14:17,071
I want to restart my life.

895
02:14:17,482 --> 02:14:20,474
I wanted to achieve something.

896
02:14:27,225 --> 02:14:28,249
Why?

897
02:14:29,428 --> 02:14:30,793
You don't need to join army all.

898
02:14:32,130 --> 02:14:33,461
There are havocs everywhere.

899
02:14:33,865 --> 02:14:35,389
There is no peace anywhere.

900
02:14:36,268 --> 02:14:39,829
You know how deep I was thinking just
to send you to study for 4 years?

901
02:14:42,841 --> 02:14:44,638
And that boy, Venkat.

902
02:14:46,845 --> 02:14:47,834
He went from here.

903
02:14:50,916 --> 02:14:52,349
Do you know how they cried
in his funeral?

904
02:14:52,651 --> 02:14:54,050
He scarified his life for nation,
it seems.

905
02:14:55,487 --> 02:14:57,284
Was anyone sad after that?

906
02:14:57,622 --> 02:14:59,590
It was only a small news in paper.

907
02:15:02,861 --> 02:15:04,158
I'II be safe, mum.

908
02:15:04,996 --> 02:15:05,985
I want to do something.

909
02:15:07,299 --> 02:15:08,789
I'm not happy.

910
02:15:08,934 --> 02:15:10,902
I can't just sit in office.

911
02:15:12,170 --> 02:15:14,502
I always had the armed force
fascination in me.

912
02:15:16,074 --> 02:15:18,099
I didn't showed it out and I didn't
tell both of you before.

913
02:15:19,444 --> 02:15:20,433
This is what I want.

914
02:15:22,447 --> 02:15:23,641
I know for sure.

915
02:15:25,817 --> 02:15:26,647
He touched his heart.

916
02:15:27,018 --> 02:15:29,179
He touched his heart ready so
don't stop him.

917
02:15:34,092 --> 02:15:36,526
The day I saw your mum,
I touched my heart.

918
02:15:37,529 --> 02:15:39,497
My only desire is your mum.

919
02:15:42,634 --> 02:15:45,626
But it was tougher than your
army life.

920
02:15:46,638 --> 02:15:47,764
Even I myself won it.

921
02:15:48,406 --> 02:15:49,964
I'm talking seriously here.

922
02:15:54,112 --> 02:15:55,204
Let him do what he wants.

923
02:15:59,417 --> 02:16:00,577
Darling, listen to me.

924
02:18:45,583 --> 02:18:46,914
After 6 years,

925
02:18:47,686 --> 02:18:49,916
For one week, I was thinking of
talking to Priya.

926
02:18:50,188 --> 02:18:52,588
Wanted to know whether she stills
loves me or not.

927
02:18:55,627 --> 02:18:58,721
suddenly, she was walking
in front of me.

928
02:18:59,497 --> 02:19:01,192
she came for me from that far.

929
02:19:30,862 --> 02:19:32,227
I've joined the army.

930
02:19:32,397 --> 02:19:33,659
My posting is here.

931
02:19:34,666 --> 02:19:36,793
I'm going to Pakistan tomorrow
by helicopter.

932
02:19:51,916 --> 02:19:52,814
That much only?

933
02:19:53,685 --> 02:19:55,016
I can afford that much only.

934
02:19:56,955 --> 02:20:00,447
You can't stay with me here.

935
02:20:01,025 --> 02:20:02,219
Need to get higher authority's
permission.

936
02:20:05,296 --> 02:20:06,490
I will stay in hotel.

937
02:20:06,631 --> 02:20:08,098
I've already made the
arrangements.

938
02:20:09,768 --> 02:20:12,134
At times, don't behave like
a man, Priya.

939
02:20:12,737 --> 02:20:13,635
It does not suit you.

940
02:20:14,406 --> 02:20:17,307
You are a beautiful girl.
so, be like that.

941
02:20:52,076 --> 02:20:54,601
I need an answer from you.

942
02:20:55,346 --> 02:20:58,804
My mum is forcing me to
get married.

943
02:21:00,552 --> 02:21:03,385
I told her that I'll only get married
to you.

944
02:21:05,190 --> 02:21:06,714
She said cannot.

945
02:21:10,628 --> 02:21:15,725
Before I convince her, I came here to know
whether I'm in your heart or not.

946
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:49,898
If you need anything,

947
02:22:27,438 --> 02:22:30,032
Yes, I want to lean on
your shoulder.

948
02:22:30,508 --> 02:22:31,532
I want to hug you.

949
02:22:35,713 --> 02:22:36,805
I want everything.

950
02:22:38,049 --> 02:22:39,243
But leave love aside.

951
02:22:40,985 --> 02:22:42,418
You must like me.

952
02:22:42,987 --> 02:22:44,579
But you didn't tell me
anything, Surya.

953
02:22:45,957 --> 02:22:47,481
I've been waiting for you
for 5 years.

954
02:22:48,226 --> 02:22:49,523
You didn't tell me anything.

955
02:22:50,461 --> 02:22:51,689
How can you touch me?

956
02:22:52,730 --> 02:22:54,288
Are you going to say that
you like me now?

957
02:22:55,466 --> 02:22:56,899
I don't need your sympathy.

958
02:22:57,068 --> 02:22:58,695
I can live alone throughout
my life.

959
02:22:59,203 --> 02:23:00,761
What I care if you don't love
me means?

960
02:23:04,576 --> 02:23:06,840
When today you walked into
the Academy,

961
02:23:07,478 --> 02:23:11,608
I realised a thing the moment
I saw you.

962
02:23:12,183 --> 02:23:14,549
That I really missed you a lot.

963
02:23:16,854 --> 02:23:19,482
I didn't say this just because you
tied saree today.

964
02:23:20,091 --> 02:23:21,023
I mean it.

965
02:23:30,735 --> 02:23:33,363
Meghna is no more, Priya.

966
02:23:34,072 --> 02:23:36,472
But I still have her memories.

967
02:23:37,475 --> 02:23:38,533
I want that.

968
02:23:39,243 --> 02:23:41,302
I know you won't have any
problem with that.

969
02:23:42,447 --> 02:23:45,177
For one year,
it was only you.

970
02:23:48,119 --> 02:23:51,350
I always want to talk to you,
to hear your voice.

971
02:23:52,090 --> 02:23:53,216
But something will stop me.

972
02:23:53,658 --> 02:23:56,593
I thought you won't believe me.
So, I'll just leave it.

973
02:23:59,063 --> 02:24:00,087
I tell you now.

974
02:24:04,068 --> 02:24:06,662
I want to lean on
your shoulder.

975
02:24:10,008 --> 02:24:11,100
Let's get married.

976
02:24:36,768 --> 02:24:37,894
I thought you will say no to me.

977
02:24:38,102 --> 02:24:40,593
And I wanted to go somewhere
else from here.

978
02:24:41,706 --> 02:24:45,073
I never thought you'll say yes to me
and ask me to marry you.

979
02:30:35,092 --> 02:30:37,026
Mr. Krishnan, open your mouth wide.

980
02:30:38,696 --> 02:30:39,788
Tell me where is the pain.

981
02:30:41,665 --> 02:30:43,257
It's in an advanced stage.

982
02:30:47,004 --> 02:30:48,369
It's difficult to Iive after that.

983
02:30:50,941 --> 02:30:52,806
All the happiness came to an end.

984
02:30:52,943 --> 02:30:54,308
He has a surgery option.

985
02:30:54,945 --> 02:30:57,311
We can get another 2 to 3 months
with that.

986
02:31:04,889 --> 02:31:07,449
I thought he'll face a heart problem.

987
02:31:07,725 --> 02:31:09,283
I never thought he'll get cancer.

988
02:31:11,295 --> 02:31:13,627
We can handle all that.
You all don't worry.

989
02:31:13,898 --> 02:31:15,024
Because of this.

990
02:31:15,800 --> 02:31:18,792
How many times I asked you
to stop smoking?

991
02:31:28,779 --> 02:31:30,713
Where are you going?
The key is with me.

992
02:31:32,883 --> 02:31:36,375
You changed so much within
one year.

993
02:31:37,388 --> 02:31:39,652
You will hold your head because
of pain.

994
02:31:40,024 --> 02:31:41,321
Without telling us anything.

995
02:31:42,426 --> 02:31:45,520
I think you shouldn't have done
this surgery, dad.

996
02:31:46,564 --> 02:31:48,031
You lost your voice.

997
02:31:48,466 --> 02:31:50,457
Like your neck was tied tightly.

998
02:31:51,602 --> 02:31:54,070
I couldn't see you like that, dad.

999
02:31:54,505 --> 02:31:55,995
I stayed away from you.

1000
02:31:56,273 --> 02:31:57,297
It's my fault.

1001
02:31:57,741 --> 02:31:59,174
I should have been with you.

1002
02:31:59,577 --> 02:32:01,306
I should have hold your hands
and sit with you.

1003
02:32:01,679 --> 02:32:03,738
I think I should have hug
you a lot.

1004
02:32:10,387 --> 02:32:11,877
This won't happen again, right?

1005
02:32:13,023 --> 02:32:14,957
I can never hug you again.

1006
02:32:29,473 --> 02:32:31,041
He's asking me to tell him story.

1007
02:32:31,041 --> 02:32:33,475
I could not.

1008
02:32:34,311 --> 02:32:35,972
I feel very difficult.

1009
02:32:39,049 --> 02:32:42,507
He's asking my dad to tell
him stories.

1010
02:32:43,220 --> 02:32:47,782
He feels sad that he can't talk
and tell him stories.

1011
02:32:49,426 --> 02:32:52,361
He asked me whether our son will forget
him or not when he grew up.

1012
02:32:53,464 --> 02:32:56,160
He asked us to tell about him
often to our son.

1013
02:32:57,968 --> 02:33:01,028
You tell often to our son
about him...

1014
02:33:05,743 --> 02:33:07,904
He will leave us and go, right?

1015
02:33:16,820 --> 02:33:17,946
I kept your sandals.

1016
02:33:18,789 --> 02:33:20,279
Dad, you can come with
your dhoti.

1017
02:33:24,461 --> 02:33:25,655
Dad, what happened?

1018
02:33:34,838 --> 02:33:36,305
I'm so afraid.

1019
02:33:37,508 --> 02:33:38,634
Do you really have to go?

1020
02:33:39,743 --> 02:33:41,677
Is there no one else to go
except you?

1021
02:33:46,750 --> 02:33:47,910
You must stay here.

1022
02:33:55,125 --> 02:33:56,353
Nothing will happen to him.

1023
02:33:57,261 --> 02:33:58,660
Doctor have told, right?

1024
02:33:59,230 --> 02:34:00,754
He will be fine for another 3 months.

1025
02:34:02,933 --> 02:34:04,127
I have to go.

1026
02:34:14,245 --> 02:34:16,179
The last I saw you dad was the day
before yesterday.

1027
02:34:16,413 --> 02:34:17,402
I still remember.

1028
02:34:20,017 --> 02:34:21,348
It's nothing.
You come, dad.

1029
02:34:22,253 --> 02:34:23,277
Have you packed?

1030
02:34:23,420 --> 02:34:25,115
I'II Ieave in an hour time.

1031
02:34:27,691 --> 02:34:29,886
I'll be back in 3 days.
You go and sleep.

1032
02:34:30,027 --> 02:34:31,460
I was about to come downstairs.

1033
02:34:31,595 --> 02:34:32,619
I came to say goodbye.

1034
02:34:40,471 --> 02:34:41,563
Come back fast.

1035
02:34:43,207 --> 02:34:46,108
Nothing else.
We will talk once you are back.

1036
02:34:58,355 --> 02:35:00,619
I'll come with you.
- No, you stay here.

1037
02:35:26,817 --> 02:35:28,478
I can never forget you, dad.

1038
02:35:39,229 --> 02:35:41,527
It's like I've lived my life again.

1039
02:35:42,066 --> 02:35:44,261
All this while, I never think
about all this.

1040
02:35:45,436 --> 02:35:47,267
I know you are the reason
for this.

1041
02:35:49,840 --> 02:35:51,102
Where are you, dad?

1042
02:35:52,509 --> 02:35:53,874
Don't leave me and go.

1043
02:36:49,333 --> 02:36:52,461
Journalist Namratha was kidnapped
in Jammu.

1044
02:36:53,070 --> 02:36:54,628
We are going to rescue her.

1045
02:36:55,005 --> 02:36:56,996
I didn't want to tell you that
before I left, dad.

1046
02:36:57,408 --> 02:36:58,898
Please be with me now.

1047
02:43:58,695 --> 02:43:59,957
They are going to bring
him away.

1048
02:44:11,274 --> 02:44:12,263
Careful!

1049
02:45:04,060 --> 02:45:06,585
Shreya, don't cry!

1050
02:45:11,234 --> 02:45:13,168
Surya, don't cry!

1051
02:45:14,204 --> 02:45:16,798
You must live happily after this
for your children.

1052
02:45:17,507 --> 02:45:19,031
Your dad always will say,

1053
02:45:24,281 --> 02:45:27,216
Even now, he wants you all to
laugh and be happy.

1054
02:45:29,419 --> 02:45:31,785
With the power of 1 000 elephants,

1055
02:45:31,922 --> 02:45:34,186
Naranan lived with that belief.

1056
02:45:35,659 --> 02:45:37,354
This was Aandal's dream.

1057
02:45:38,395 --> 02:45:40,795
Dad was a person who came to
beat that 1000 elephants.

1058
02:45:42,766 --> 02:45:46,065
As for me, he came and
married me.

1059
02:45:47,804 --> 02:45:50,671
But you are the one really who came
to beat 1 000 elephants.

1060
02:45:50,807 --> 02:45:52,104
Priya, did you heard that?

1061
02:45:52,242 --> 02:45:53,869
If you ask your wife,
she will tell you.

1062
02:46:00,784 --> 02:46:02,376
You are with us, dad.

1063
02:46:03,186 --> 02:46:04,517
I know, daddy.

1064
02:46:31,414 --> 02:46:35,748
- THE END -
