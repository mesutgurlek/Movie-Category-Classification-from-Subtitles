1
00:00:34,647 --> 00:00:39,084
You need to wake up early,

2
00:00:39,887 --> 00:00:44,119
I hid the alarm clock.

3
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:49,765
You filled the tub with water,

4
00:00:50,887 --> 00:00:54,766
I'll make it overflow.

5
00:00:56,287 --> 00:01:00,838
You have the cigarettes,

6
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:05,680
I have the lighter.

7
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:10,883
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BED

8
00:01:12,487 --> 00:01:16,162
...I break your heart.

9
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:21,320
Oh, what a honeymoon...

10
00:01:21,487 --> 00:01:24,763
Hotels and long swims

11
00:01:24,927 --> 00:01:27,236
at sunset.

12
00:01:28,247 --> 00:01:32,320
Wait till you hear the wonderful

13
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:35,479
songs they'll sing to us

14
00:01:35,647 --> 00:01:38,400
at dawn.

15
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:54,798
You've got the live bait,

16
00:01:55,847 --> 00:01:59,726
I've got the fishing pole.

17
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:05,559
You interrupt me when I speak,

18
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:10,766
I'm all you ever talk about.

19
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:16,359
You take me to England,

20
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:21,281
I take you to Gibraltar.

21
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:27,638
You wear the pants,

22
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:32,519
I don't wear a nightdress.

23
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:36,165
Oh, what a honeymoon...

24
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:40,605
Hotels and long swims

25
00:02:40,847 --> 00:02:42,997
at sunset.

26
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:48,398
Wait till you hear the wonderful

27
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:51,445
songs they'll sing to us

28
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:54,519
at dawn.

29
00:03:13,407 --> 00:03:14,601
Are you sure?

30
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:20,360
Maybe it's your period,

31
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:21,880
for example.

32
00:03:22,527 --> 00:03:26,486
Right, my period's coming
and I've got sinusitis.

33
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,035
But that's irrelevant.

34
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:31,882
-Of course it's relevant.
-No, it's not.

35
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:34,844
I'm in love, Pedro.

36
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:36,921
I'm positive.

37
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:38,924
Don't be so sure.

38
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:43,038
It's just sexual attraction.
It happens to me

39
00:03:43,207 --> 00:03:45,516
sometimes, very rarely,

40
00:03:46,607 --> 00:03:47,801
almost never.

41
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:52,239
I just don't think
it's reason enough

42
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:54,716
to dump me. It's just a phase.

43
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,596
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:09,237
We can still be friends.

45
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:16,318
It was full of lint
and it was ugly anyway.

46
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:19,286
Your mother makes you
such ugly sweaters.

47
00:04:19,847 --> 00:04:22,315
I gave it to them for the play.

48
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:24,285
You don't mind, do you?

49
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:26,964
Of course I mind!

50
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:29,365
Where is it? Give it back.

51
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:31,399
You're always helping them.

52
00:04:31,727 --> 00:04:34,844
Last week it was money
and now my clothes?

53
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:39,642
Honey, I wear this tie
all the time.

54
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:42,795
-Here.
-Just cool it.

55
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:47,720
Sonia, we're not a charity.
We'll never buy that apartment.

56
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,238
-What happened?
-What?

57
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:52,961
What have you done?

58
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,643
What have you done to my sweater?

59
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:58,998
This isn't funny!
What is this?

60
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:02,523
-You can't wear that in public.
-Not any more.

61
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:06,599
Not even in a circus.

62
00:05:10,327 --> 00:05:12,124
Look what she did to it.

63
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:16,958
Always helping her friends
from Lucia's theater group.

64
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,435
My love...

65
00:05:19,847 --> 00:05:20,962
My love...

66
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:22,526
-My love!
-What?

67
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:27,477
Go ahead and paint their faces.
But don't give them my clothes.

68
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:31,715
No, not ''oy''.
We're not the Medici family.

69
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:34,519
Paula dumped me.

70
00:05:35,647 --> 00:05:36,796
What?

71
00:05:37,927 --> 00:05:39,360
What happened?

72
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,079
She's in love with someone else.
Didn't say who.

73
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:49,437
Hey, she probably went back
to an old boyfriend.

74
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:52,161
Pedro, Pedro.

75
00:05:52,327 --> 00:05:55,319
Don't worry about it.
It's all right.

76
00:05:55,807 --> 00:05:59,402
Paula leaves me to go fuck
some big hard stud

77
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,558
and you say it's all right?

78
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,639
Okay, maybe not.
But it could be good for you.

79
00:06:04,807 --> 00:06:06,240
Don't tell him that.

80
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:09,478
Everything will be fine.

81
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:11,683
Don't tell him that, either.

82
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:16,243
This isn't a washing machine,
you can't just fix it.

83
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:19,236
The relationship failed,
that's all.

84
00:06:19,407 --> 00:06:20,556
Just like giving

85
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:23,195
money to the theater group.
Another failure.

86
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:26,365
Paula's only had two boyfriends.
One's in Mexico,

87
00:06:26,527 --> 00:06:30,520
so it must be the other one.
Daniel. You're right,

88
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:32,962
-they still see each other.
-Who cares

89
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:34,355
who Paula's with?

90
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:38,076
That's what I'm saying,
it doesn't matter. Definitely

91
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:39,999
that Daniel guy. Who cares?

92
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:43,515
Sorry, Pedro,
but I have to go to work.

93
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,960
Come on, cheer up.
Take the sweater and give me a kiss.

94
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:51,285
I'll call you later.

95
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:02,044
It's nothing, you'll see.

96
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:04,366
Of course it's nothing.

97
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:06,404
Daniel's gay.

98
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:10,316
He moved in with a guy
after he and Paula broke up.

99
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:36,484
-Looks expensive, doesn't it?
-We'll go Dutch.

100
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:37,636
-No.
-Sure.

101
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:39,644
-No, Paula.
-Why should you pay?

102
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:42,401
No, it doesn't feel right.
How much?

103
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:43,841
1 4,500.

104
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:47,527
Wait, wait, let's do this.

105
00:07:47,727 --> 00:07:50,116
I'll pay 8,500...

106
00:07:50,287 --> 00:07:52,482
-Seven.
-You pay 6,000.

107
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:56,563
-We're 500 short.
-Right.

108
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,278
-I'll pay you back later.
-No.

109
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:04,759
One thing's for sure.

110
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:08,645
You jumped the gun
telling him so soon.

111
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:10,965
I jumped the gun?

112
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:14,077
I thought you would wait longer.

113
00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:18,483
But don't worry about Pedro.
He'll be fine in a couple days.

114
00:08:18,647 --> 00:08:20,285
I don't want him to suffer.

115
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,199
Don't get all sad on me.

116
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:25,756
That's forbidden.

117
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:27,919
Let me see that smile.

118
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:30,686
You remember?

119
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:34,039
A little stretch here,
another over there,

120
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,797
and just pull the string
right here...

121
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:40,882
Nice, isn't it?

122
00:08:42,327 --> 00:08:46,366
When will you tell Sonia?
You promised to tell her first.

123
00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:49,720
Right, that was the idea.

124
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:53,281
I'll just have to wait
a bit longer.

125
00:08:53,727 --> 00:08:54,682
Why?

126
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:58,086
Because if I tell her now,
they'll know.

127
00:08:58,607 --> 00:09:01,360
Javier, that's the point.
They have to know.

128
00:09:02,047 --> 00:09:03,321
Oh, right.

129
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:05,685
Of course they do!

130
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:08,726
-Silly!
-Hey!

131
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:10,516
Watch it.

132
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:12,801
Seriously...

133
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:16,680
I still haven't exactly told her,

134
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:19,477
but I've sent her signals.

135
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:22,161
-Signals?
-To prepare her.

136
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:26,199
I've been very busy lately.

137
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:29,837
-Why?
-Well, because... I've got

138
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:32,123
-a surprise for you.
-For me?

139
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:33,402
What surprise?

140
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:35,036
Well...

141
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:41,285
We're going away
just you and me

142
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:44,002
for a whole weekend
in an incredible

143
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,522
house in the mountains.

144
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:49,561
Careful with that little smile.

145
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:53,923
-What's wrong with it?
-It's turning me on.

146
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,957
Well, what's turning me off,

147
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:01,761
driving me completely insane,

148
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:05,681
are these pretty little panties.

149
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:08,799
Then why take them off?

150
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:13,397
To check the size.
I want to buy myself a pair.

151
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:15,762
Yeah? Know what I want to buy?

152
00:10:16,287 --> 00:10:19,882
Some underwear like yours.
They remind me of my grandfather.

153
00:10:20,407 --> 00:10:21,635
No shit.

154
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:24,846
You and grandpa, eh?

155
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:28,566
You little tramp.

156
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:35,325
I have something to say.

157
00:10:41,727 --> 00:10:43,160
Was that clear?

158
00:10:43,487 --> 00:10:45,603
-No.
-I'll say it again.

159
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,843
-What about now?
-Better.

160
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:54,641
-Now let's put some life into it.
-Oh, yeah.

161
00:10:54,927 --> 00:10:56,679
-Would you like that?
-Yeah.

162
00:11:01,887 --> 00:11:04,959
How's Pedro? Is he any better?

163
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:06,162
Not at all.

164
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:08,922
He realized it can't be Daniel

165
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:11,157
and spent all day listing every

166
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:13,761
-single guy Paula knows.
-Why not Daniel?

167
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:16,005
Because he's gay.

168
00:11:17,607 --> 00:11:19,677
Why are you in bed already?

169
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:22,882
I'm exhausted. What a day...

170
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:24,362
Too bad.

171
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:26,603
I thought you might be
in the mood.

172
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:35,326
No, Sonia, I can't.

173
00:11:36,207 --> 00:11:37,526
I'm physically

174
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,757
-destroyed.
-And I'm hot all over.

175
00:11:46,727 --> 00:11:48,001
Wait, wait.

176
00:11:48,647 --> 00:11:50,319
-Wait.
-What?

177
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:53,040
I need to talk to you.

178
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:56,961
I have something to say.

179
00:11:58,207 --> 00:11:59,925
What is it?

180
00:12:01,527 --> 00:12:02,596
Well...

181
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:11,802
I have to go to Avila

182
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:16,357
for the weekend
for a work meeting.

183
00:12:18,247 --> 00:12:19,396
Fine.

184
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:22,043
Don't worry, it's all right.

185
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:27,322
And...

186
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:29,081
What, my love?

187
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:33,440
I love you so much.

188
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:36,916
Me, too.

189
00:12:44,287 --> 00:12:47,996
And Daniel can't be gay,
if he went out with Paula...

190
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:51,520
Not everything in life
is black or white.

191
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,440
Many people think
we're all bisexuals.

192
00:12:54,727 --> 00:12:57,321
That's right. There you go.

193
00:12:57,487 --> 00:12:59,762
Daniel could be with Paula
because

194
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:01,326
first he was white,

195
00:13:01,487 --> 00:13:03,842
then black, then white again.

196
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:05,326
-Then grey.
-What?

197
00:13:05,807 --> 00:13:07,001
He likes it all.

198
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:10,876
Like you said. We're all
bisexual, not me though.

199
00:13:11,247 --> 00:13:13,920
But Daniel could be with Paula
because he is

200
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:16,639
bisexual, right?

201
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:18,960
What's wrong with you?

202
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:22,240
What have you been doing?

203
00:13:22,407 --> 00:13:24,477
Nothing, nothing.

204
00:13:24,647 --> 00:13:26,444
I was working, of course.

205
00:13:27,087 --> 00:13:28,645
Take off my bra.

206
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:32,322
Being gay isn't like smoking.
You can't just quit.

207
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:34,916
I don't know.

208
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:46,965
Hey, hey, don't do that.
You're too tired.

209
00:13:50,607 --> 00:13:52,882
Although if you want

210
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:56,323
you can just lie there
and I'll do the rest.

211
00:13:57,527 --> 00:13:58,721
Sure.

212
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:01,403
-You know what?
-What?

213
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:05,005
-Who cares who Paula's with?
-Exactly.

214
00:14:35,727 --> 00:14:38,480
Don't know what to do.
Four hands, four arms,

215
00:14:38,647 --> 00:14:41,161
two doors and one key.

216
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:44,838
Sounds fun, a real mess,
lots of noise,

217
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:46,804
too much lipstick.

218
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,247
-Four legs...
-And one friend.

219
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:53,365
-What will you do?
-Don't know what to do.

220
00:14:54,007 --> 00:14:57,124
-What will you do?
-Don't know what to do.

221
00:14:57,607 --> 00:14:59,120
What will you do?

222
00:14:59,287 --> 00:15:00,800
Don't know what to do.

223
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,798
What will you do?

224
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:04,559
Don't know what to do.

225
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:06,803
I sing you to sleep.

226
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:09,003
Feed you when you're hungry.

227
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:11,761
Can't keep you warm enough.

228
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:13,121
Give me more, my love.

229
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,676
Sorry, I just...

230
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:17,485
A real mess, four hands,

231
00:15:17,647 --> 00:15:18,966
-four arms...
-And one friend.

232
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,719
What will you do?

233
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:22,525
Don't know what to do.

234
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:26,197
-What will you do?
-Don't know what to do.

235
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:29,837
-What will you do?
-Don't know what to do.

236
00:15:30,007 --> 00:15:31,838
What will you do?

237
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:34,475
Poor baby,
doesn't know what to do.

238
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,600
Four hands, four arms,

239
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:52,156
too much lipstick.
A real mess,

240
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,646
lots of noise.

241
00:15:53,807 --> 00:15:56,401
Don't know what to do.
Let's run away.

242
00:15:57,487 --> 00:15:59,523
You're too cold for me.

243
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:02,121
Can't keep you warm enough.

244
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:05,677
-What will you do?
-But I just put on

245
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:07,644
my pants!

246
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:13,000
Sounds fun.
Four arms, four hands,

247
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:16,637
-four legs, two doors, one key.
-And one friend.

248
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,122
Hey, champ.

249
00:16:32,087 --> 00:16:34,965
You're looking
much better already.

250
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:37,199
You're almost over it.

251
00:16:39,247 --> 00:16:41,283
I didn't sleep a wink.

252
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:45,996
Of course,
that's a symptom of recovery.

253
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:50,516
Otherwise you'd be lying around
depressed all day. Not you.

254
00:16:51,447 --> 00:16:54,120
Your mind is staying active.

255
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:57,039
That's why you couldn't sleep.

256
00:16:57,207 --> 00:17:00,244
I couldn't sleep because
when I closed my eyes

257
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:02,045
I saw her fucking another guy.

258
00:17:03,007 --> 00:17:05,567
Even worse,
the bitch's face lit up

259
00:17:06,247 --> 00:17:07,726
like I've never seen.

260
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:12,079
Did you imagine her with...
What's his name?

261
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:15,037
-David?
-No, Daniel.

262
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:17,641
-Right, Daniel.
-But Daniel's gay.

263
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,436
Good afternoon.

264
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:20,642
Hello.

265
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:24,956
What do you mean, gay?
He went out with Paula.

266
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,446
No, he's gay.

267
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,081
You're misinformed.

268
00:17:29,247 --> 00:17:32,000
Did you know that
new research says

269
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:33,965
we're all bisexual?

270
00:17:35,327 --> 00:17:36,999
I could fall in love with you.

271
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:38,998
You fall in love with me?
How?

272
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:41,558
I just could. It happens.

273
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,287
For who you are. We go way back.

274
00:17:44,767 --> 00:17:46,962
Lots of friends fall in love.

275
00:17:48,127 --> 00:17:52,166
-Just focus on Paula and Daniel.
-It's not him.

276
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:56,404
Daniel and his boyfriend
are a registered couple.

277
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:58,444
That means nothing, Pedro.

278
00:17:58,607 --> 00:18:01,838
You know how promiscuous
homosexuals are.

279
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:06,399
-With men, not women!
-Aren't you listening to me?

280
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:10,602
That's secondary. Besides, I'm not
making this up. It's science.

281
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:12,446
Excuse us.
Play for service.

282
00:18:13,447 --> 00:18:14,402
Yes.

283
00:18:15,807 --> 00:18:17,365
Believe me, Pedro.

284
00:18:17,687 --> 00:18:20,326
I don't know who it is,
but I'll kill him.

285
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:24,283
Out!

286
00:18:26,247 --> 00:18:27,236
What?

287
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:30,439
What do you mean, out?

288
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:34,043
This guy's cheating at a
singles / couples tournament.

289
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:35,606
Damnit, Pedro.

290
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:38,759
-It was three feet long!
-Bullshit!

291
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:41,077
-Calm down.
-You think I'm stupid?

292
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:43,239
Go ahead, say it.

293
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:44,522
It was way long.

294
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:47,804
-Besides, it didn't count.
-That's right.

295
00:18:49,847 --> 00:18:53,157
All right, all right.
You serve.

296
00:18:55,447 --> 00:18:58,837
Forgive him,
he's going through rough times.

297
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:01,517
His girlfriend dumped him
for a homo.

298
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:03,803
How could she dump him
for a homo?

299
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:07,600
The guy used to be one.
He isn't any more.

300
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:10,156
Sure. Everything isn't
always black or white.

301
00:19:10,687 --> 00:19:13,042
Besides,
we're all bisexual anyway.

302
00:19:17,247 --> 00:19:20,523
It was obvious, Pedro.
I saw it coming. You know why?

303
00:19:20,887 --> 00:19:23,720
You were too nice to her.
Women hate that.

304
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:26,640
The worse you treat them,
the hornier they get.

305
00:19:26,807 --> 00:19:30,846
You're too soft, Pedro.
You're lucky to be rid of her.

306
00:19:31,007 --> 00:19:34,920
-That's right, Pedro.
-Girlfriends are the worst.

307
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:36,839
-Right, Carlos?
-Yeah, but...

308
00:19:37,007 --> 00:19:39,282
No buts. Look at Carlos.

309
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:42,041
Happily single.
Now it's your turn.

310
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,643
You can do whatever you want
without answering to anybody.

311
00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:47,001
And consider this:

312
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:50,601
girlfriends never last.

313
00:19:51,127 --> 00:19:55,564
But an ex-girlfriend lasts forever.
You can fuck her whenever you want.

314
00:19:56,047 --> 00:19:58,561
-It's been proven.
-Actually...

315
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:03,284
But you and victoria
have been going out since...

316
00:20:03,447 --> 00:20:08,237
So what? Sure, I live with victoria.
But I screw all the women I can.

317
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,726
That's the trick.

318
00:20:10,327 --> 00:20:13,683
Know what's wrong with this country?
People don't fuck enough.

319
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:16,162
Forget what the sociologists say.

320
00:20:16,447 --> 00:20:19,837
I've learned what I know
from life itself.

321
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:21,725
-People...
-What's your point?

322
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,843
-What's your point?
-Shit, Pedro.

323
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:25,725
Don't interrupt me.

324
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:27,675
People go crazy.

325
00:20:27,847 --> 00:20:29,485
Why? Lack of sex.

326
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:32,640
When you become a couple
you screw less.

327
00:20:33,327 --> 00:20:36,125
-Nobody knows why, but it's true.
-Not me.

328
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:38,997
So people end up unhappy.

329
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:41,283
What about me?
I fuck like a champ.

330
00:20:41,527 --> 00:20:43,802
I have a girlfriend
but I screw around,

331
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:48,563
which is what keeps us happy
and together. Like in Cuba.

332
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:51,241
Cubans are living on food rations,

333
00:20:51,407 --> 00:20:53,125
practically starving to death,

334
00:20:53,327 --> 00:20:56,319
but they're happy. Why?
Because they're always fucking.

335
00:20:56,967 --> 00:21:00,039
You always see them dancing
and screwing around.

336
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:03,201
-It's the Latin character.
-Yeah, but Cuba...

337
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:06,245
You see, Pedro? That should be
your motto. Forget Paula.

338
00:21:06,407 --> 00:21:09,285
To hell with her.
I know plenty of choice girls.

339
00:21:09,447 --> 00:21:11,085
They don't need to be choice.

340
00:21:12,927 --> 00:21:15,839
The other day this total babe
got in my taxi.

341
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:18,997
I came on to her, but nothing.

342
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:21,597
Was I upset?
Not at all. Her loss.

343
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:24,645
Then later I picked up
some ugly ass bitch.

344
00:21:24,807 --> 00:21:26,684
Of course I tried again.

345
00:21:26,927 --> 00:21:28,042
I'm mature enough

346
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:30,357
to see beyond a woman's physique.

347
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:35,199
1 5 minutes later I'm fucking
her doggie-style in a field,

348
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:38,439
yanking her by the hair
as she screams for more.

349
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:40,440
And you know what?

350
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:43,605
Even charged her full fare.

351
00:21:50,287 --> 00:21:53,199
There's something special
about girls.

352
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:56,401
Girls are warriors!

353
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:59,925
From their perfume
to their pearls.

354
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:02,598
Girls are warriors!

355
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,961
College girls with their hair
in curls.

356
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:09,283
Girls are warriors!

357
00:22:10,127 --> 00:22:13,164
In magazines or in person...

358
00:22:13,727 --> 00:22:16,002
Girls are warriors!

359
00:22:20,247 --> 00:22:22,602
Girls are warriors!

360
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:29,241
Girls are warriors!

361
00:22:30,247 --> 00:22:33,045
Playing with them
is like handling...

362
00:22:33,607 --> 00:22:35,677
nitroglycerine.

363
00:22:36,407 --> 00:22:39,638
More voltage than
a nuclear power plant...

364
00:22:40,087 --> 00:22:41,805
And less radiation.

365
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:45,845
They're in charge from the start,

366
00:22:46,287 --> 00:22:49,279
driving a stake
through your heart.

367
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:52,206
If the world's in a whirl,

368
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:56,879
some doll must have her hips
in a twirl.

369
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:12,278
They're in charge from the start,

370
00:23:12,727 --> 00:23:15,639
driving a stake
through your heart.

371
00:23:15,847 --> 00:23:18,759
If the world's in a whirl,

372
00:23:19,007 --> 00:23:22,397
some doll must have her hips
in a twirl.

373
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,365
There's something special
about girls.

374
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:28,362
Girls are warriors!

375
00:23:29,087 --> 00:23:32,284
From their perfume
to their pearls.

376
00:23:32,887 --> 00:23:35,481
Girls are warriors!

377
00:23:39,287 --> 00:23:41,482
Girls are warriors!

378
00:23:45,807 --> 00:23:48,116
Girls are warriors!

379
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:51,800
There's something special
about girls.

380
00:23:52,127 --> 00:23:55,199
I just can't handle it.

381
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,479
They're warriors!

382
00:24:05,447 --> 00:24:06,926
My love.

383
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:10,877
Why don't we introduce Pedro
to your friend Nuria?

384
00:24:12,287 --> 00:24:16,075
She has a boyfriend, and Pedro's
still in love with Paula.

385
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:18,686
You know what?

386
00:24:19,847 --> 00:24:22,281
I think it's really touching.

387
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:28,318
-What about Lucia?
-What?

388
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:32,562
She's sweet, pretty
and no boyfriend.

389
00:24:32,727 --> 00:24:35,605
Of course not.
She's a lesbian.

390
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:41,402
-Lucia from the theater group?
-Yes.

391
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:46,203
No shit!
She doesn't look like one.

392
00:24:48,527 --> 00:24:49,562
Well?

393
00:24:51,287 --> 00:24:54,245
In your opinion,
what do lesbians look like?

394
00:24:55,647 --> 00:24:58,559
Like lesbians. Short hair,

395
00:24:59,087 --> 00:25:00,679
checkered shirt, glasses...

396
00:25:03,487 --> 00:25:07,321
very nice. You might as well say it
while scratching your balls.

397
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:15,119
So that makes me a lesbian.

398
00:25:15,407 --> 00:25:18,160
Sonia, I have nothing
against lesbians.

399
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:21,476
Though that shirt
isn't very feminine.

400
00:25:22,127 --> 00:25:24,595
So Lucia and Pedro...?

401
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:27,122
-Lucia's a lesbian!
-Okay, okay!

402
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:31,285
-You said we're all bisexuals.
-Just drop it.

403
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:36,122
Lucia's happy as it is. She doesn't
need guidance from a stud like you.

404
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:38,437
I was only trying to help Pedro.

405
00:25:39,327 --> 00:25:41,045
Don't get upset.

406
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:43,524
So sensitive.

407
00:25:46,607 --> 00:25:50,486
-Sonia, that smells awful.
-It'll go away.

408
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:57,156
It's going to stink forever.

409
00:25:57,327 --> 00:25:59,204
No, please!

410
00:26:02,927 --> 00:26:03,837
I'll kill you.

411
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,442
Son of a bitch!

412
00:26:34,847 --> 00:26:37,680
Will you fill out a survey
on drugs?

413
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:40,725
Get away. Always the same crap
about drugs.

414
00:26:40,887 --> 00:26:42,320
What a schmuck.

415
00:26:46,127 --> 00:26:47,196
Scumbag.

416
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:51,286
-I'll kick your ass.
-Curly!

417
00:27:13,927 --> 00:27:18,318
Hello? Hi, Pedro. What's up?

418
00:27:18,487 --> 00:27:19,886
I'm spying on Paula.

419
00:27:21,447 --> 00:27:22,846
You're doing what?

420
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:24,645
Spying on Paula.

421
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:26,919
You're spying on her?

422
00:27:27,287 --> 00:27:30,165
Forget it. But I just saw
Sonia enter her office.

423
00:27:30,487 --> 00:27:31,840
Why is she here?

424
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:35,236
Hello?

425
00:27:36,127 --> 00:27:37,242
Javier?

426
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:47,517
-Where are they?
-Still inside.

427
00:27:48,327 --> 00:27:50,841
Thanks, but you didn't
have to come.

428
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:54,443
Pedro, why the hell are you
spying on Paula?

429
00:27:54,687 --> 00:27:57,326
-What?
-It's absurd, don't you see?

430
00:27:57,607 --> 00:27:59,563
Come on, I'll take you home.

431
00:28:00,207 --> 00:28:02,004
Promise not to do it again.

432
00:28:18,527 --> 00:28:21,280
-Hi.
-Hi. What are you doing here?

433
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:24,837
-What a coincidence. And you?
-I came to talk to Paula.

434
00:28:25,047 --> 00:28:26,400
-Great.
-What about you?

435
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:28,963
I have a client nearby.

436
00:28:31,607 --> 00:28:33,484
-Paula, how are you?
-Hi.

437
00:28:38,407 --> 00:28:39,965
It's been so long.

438
00:28:41,527 --> 00:28:44,997
-What are you two up to?
-Going for coffee. Come with us.

439
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:46,316
Okay.

440
00:28:49,607 --> 00:28:51,598
-What a coincidence.
-Yeah.

441
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,558
Do you think it's permanent?

442
00:29:25,207 --> 00:29:28,324
All couples have problems,
right?

443
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,521
Yeah, but don't push your luck.

444
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:36,396
-I'm seeing someone else anyway.
-Right, someone else.

445
00:29:37,447 --> 00:29:40,803
End of story.
Let's just drop it.

446
00:29:40,967 --> 00:29:43,959
It's too bad they broke up,
but that's life.

447
00:29:44,327 --> 00:29:45,555
Pedro's over her

448
00:29:45,727 --> 00:29:47,797
anyway. He's doing great.

449
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:50,760
And how are you two?
I mean as a couple.

450
00:29:52,127 --> 00:29:55,199
Fine. Actually, great.

451
00:29:55,847 --> 00:29:57,405
We're going to buy a place.

452
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,196
R eally?

453
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:01,403
Just an investment, really.

454
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:04,640
No, not just as an investment.

455
00:30:06,287 --> 00:30:08,198
How about you and the new guy?

456
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:09,762
Not too well.

457
00:30:09,927 --> 00:30:11,155
Actually, he still

458
00:30:11,327 --> 00:30:13,443
hasn't even dumped
his girlfriend.

459
00:30:14,327 --> 00:30:18,878
Well, give him time.
Maybe he hasn't told her yet,

460
00:30:19,047 --> 00:30:20,799
but he's sending her signals.

461
00:30:20,967 --> 00:30:22,878
I don't see him sending many
''signals''.

462
00:30:23,047 --> 00:30:25,322
I'll just tell her myself.

463
00:30:27,487 --> 00:30:29,205
No, don't do that.

464
00:30:29,487 --> 00:30:32,763
That would be a big mistake.
Totally.

465
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:34,599
Don't go there.

466
00:30:40,247 --> 00:30:41,077
Hey!

467
00:30:41,247 --> 00:30:43,681
-What a surprise!
-Hi.

468
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:45,764
We were in the neighborhood...

469
00:30:46,727 --> 00:30:48,877
-How are you, Paula?
-Fine. You?

470
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:52,835
Let me introduce you all.
Paula, Javier, Sonia, this is...

471
00:30:53,007 --> 00:30:54,520
-my girlfriend, Jessica.
-Jennifer.

472
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:57,645
Jennifer, my girlfriend.
Why are you all here?

473
00:30:57,807 --> 00:31:00,958
We ran into each other.
We're having coffee.

474
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:02,196
Oh, great.

475
00:31:02,367 --> 00:31:05,245
We're just refueling a bit,
right Jennifer?

476
00:31:05,607 --> 00:31:07,199
We've been fucking all day.

477
00:31:08,807 --> 00:31:10,126
We'll join you.

478
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:11,515
I'm off to work.

479
00:31:12,727 --> 00:31:16,402
That's too bad. Anyway, Paula...

480
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:19,401
Give me a call sometime.
Actually, no.

481
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:20,682
I'll call you.

482
00:31:21,207 --> 00:31:23,004
I'm always with Jennifer.

483
00:31:23,247 --> 00:31:25,715
-Can I order something?
-Sure, honey.

484
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:28,957
A pitcher of sangría
and some donuts.

485
00:31:47,047 --> 00:31:51,404
Right. I have my own, unique method
of investigation: T.I.S.

486
00:31:51,567 --> 00:31:52,761
T.I.S.

487
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:56,840
''Total Investigation System''.
It's 1 00º/º reliable.

488
00:31:57,527 --> 00:32:00,280
-Does it work?
-Does it work?

489
00:32:00,887 --> 00:32:02,479
Name any famous case.

490
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:06,004
The most famous case
ever resolved.

491
00:32:07,407 --> 00:32:08,999
Who killed JFK, right?

492
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:14,242
-Well, I'm here because...
-You don't know, do you?

493
00:32:18,207 --> 00:32:19,435
Oswald, right?

494
00:32:20,847 --> 00:32:22,439
Please, Mr. Campillo.

495
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:26,120
Come with me.

496
00:32:27,127 --> 00:32:30,881
You can't possibly believe the lies
in the Warren Commission R eport.

497
00:32:31,847 --> 00:32:33,599
Right, it was a conspiracy.

498
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:38,726
Organized by the aforementioned.
Kennedy killed himself.

499
00:32:41,087 --> 00:32:42,361
Oswald was what I call

500
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,563
an ''imaginary guilty''.

501
00:32:44,727 --> 00:32:46,843
There were many in this case.

502
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:50,484
I found all this out
with my T.I.S. method.

503
00:32:50,647 --> 00:32:53,764
So how about following
my girlfriend?

504
00:32:53,927 --> 00:32:57,966
Right now I'm free. I've finished
investigating Marilyn's death,

505
00:32:58,127 --> 00:33:00,004
so I can take your case.

506
00:33:00,207 --> 00:33:03,483
I need photos and personal info.
Right away.

507
00:33:04,647 --> 00:33:07,719
What about the slides?
They're excellent.

508
00:33:07,887 --> 00:33:10,481
-The boss will love them.
-What do I care?

509
00:33:11,927 --> 00:33:14,566
TOD AY IS THE FIRST D AY
OF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

510
00:33:16,047 --> 00:33:17,002
Hi.

511
00:33:18,687 --> 00:33:19,802
How are you?

512
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:21,886
Hi, Paula.

513
00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:25,081
You look great.
I brought you flowers.

514
00:33:25,527 --> 00:33:27,245
Want to see a movie later?

515
00:33:27,407 --> 00:33:30,285
No, I don't want to do
anything with you.

516
00:33:31,447 --> 00:33:35,156
-Tell me when the meeting's set.
-Where's the copy machine?

517
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:36,806
Right over there.

518
00:33:38,087 --> 00:33:41,966
''Sending her signals''. Now I see
the signals you're sending.

519
00:33:42,127 --> 00:33:45,199
Of course they're signals.
They're subtle, that's all.

520
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:49,246
Sure, like buying a place together.
You can't fool me.

521
00:33:49,407 --> 00:33:51,637
-You won't leave her.
-Yes I will.

522
00:33:54,127 --> 00:33:55,480
I'm going to leave her.

523
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:58,803
And there's no new apartment
because...

524
00:33:58,967 --> 00:34:00,241
Just because.

525
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:04,277
Besides, would we go away
for the weekend if I weren't sure?

526
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:06,759
That's a pretty big signal.

527
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:09,236
Paula.

528
00:34:12,487 --> 00:34:17,003
Don't be upset. You know
I'm dying to spend time with you.

529
00:34:18,447 --> 00:34:22,725
-We're going away this weekend?
-Sure, it's all planned.

530
00:34:23,047 --> 00:34:26,756
This weekend or next.
Two incredible days, you'll see.

531
00:34:31,567 --> 00:34:33,558
Don't give me that smile again.

532
00:34:35,087 --> 00:34:37,521
-We could do it right here.
-No.

533
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,120
-I'm off. I'll call you later.
-Okay.

534
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,766
We'll see a movie.

535
00:34:43,767 --> 00:34:45,041
Don't be angry.

536
00:34:45,847 --> 00:34:49,078
Javi, wait.
I want to tell you something.

537
00:34:49,527 --> 00:34:50,755
Come on.

538
00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:10,399
There's something
I want to tell you.

539
00:35:11,247 --> 00:35:15,798
It's important,
at least to me.

540
00:35:16,287 --> 00:35:19,836
I haven't slept all night

541
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:23,524
because there's something

542
00:35:23,687 --> 00:35:26,042
I need to hear you say...

543
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:36,804
Tell me that you love me.

544
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:47,323
Tell me that you love me.

545
00:35:57,487 --> 00:35:59,876
I'm sad and I need

546
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:01,036
to know...

547
00:36:02,487 --> 00:36:06,605
if you really love me
like yesterday.

548
00:36:07,527 --> 00:36:09,802
It might seem silly

549
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,435
but I'm going to ask you

550
00:36:12,727 --> 00:36:17,437
to say it again and again
and again.

551
00:36:24,927 --> 00:36:27,999
Tell me that you love me.

552
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:38,324
Tell me that you love me.

553
00:36:45,447 --> 00:36:49,725
Tell me that you love me.

554
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:02,036
Monica, you're looking fantastic.

555
00:37:03,047 --> 00:37:04,321
-What do you want?
-Me?

556
00:37:04,487 --> 00:37:06,239
Nothing. Nothing at all.

557
00:37:06,927 --> 00:37:09,600
Well, there is one thing.

558
00:37:09,887 --> 00:37:12,959
I was wondering if
you're still single.

559
00:37:13,127 --> 00:37:15,925
Javier, I think you've
hurt me enough.

560
00:37:16,087 --> 00:37:19,523
That's why I want you to meet
a friend of mine.

561
00:37:20,047 --> 00:37:21,878
You two are made for each other.

562
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:24,925
That's what you said about us.
Until you dumped me.

563
00:37:25,127 --> 00:37:27,880
Fine, you don't have to meet him.

564
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:32,280
One more thing. That house
of yours in the mountains...

565
00:37:33,847 --> 00:37:37,522
Could I rent it?
Or maybe use it for free?

566
00:37:38,287 --> 00:37:39,561
That would be great.

567
00:37:40,247 --> 00:37:42,238
Yeah, it sure would.

568
00:37:44,447 --> 00:37:48,884
You've got some nerve!
I know what you want it for.

569
00:37:49,687 --> 00:37:52,838
-Fine, rent it to me.
-I love the mountains.

570
00:37:53,007 --> 00:37:56,966
Strolling through the country,
by the river, along paths,

571
00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:59,886
through the fields.
I love walking.

572
00:38:00,287 --> 00:38:01,845
Not just in the mountains,

573
00:38:02,007 --> 00:38:05,317
also in the city, in the park,
through the streets,

574
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:07,205
down the big avenues...

575
00:38:07,447 --> 00:38:09,642
Excuse me, I'm sort of busy.

576
00:38:13,287 --> 00:38:14,925
Wait a moment, Javier.

577
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:17,558
I was unfair to you.

578
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:21,323
You're trying to be nice
and I was nasty to you.

579
00:38:21,487 --> 00:38:23,364
-It's okay.
-Look.

580
00:38:23,727 --> 00:38:27,163
You can use the house.
I want us to stay friends.

581
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:30,319
I can use the house?

582
00:38:30,807 --> 00:38:34,197
Thank you so much, Monica.
That's a huge favor.

583
00:38:34,807 --> 00:38:38,038
-You're welcome.
-Do you want to meet my friend?

584
00:38:38,207 --> 00:38:41,882
Friends are the most
important thing in the world.

585
00:38:42,047 --> 00:38:45,005
Though true friends
are hard to come by.

586
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:47,323
True friends are people

587
00:38:47,487 --> 00:38:50,524
you can count on
through good times and bad.

588
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:53,042
I love going out with friends.
Movies,

589
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:57,564
strolls, riding bikes,
the flea market, out for dinner...

590
00:38:58,087 --> 00:39:01,204
Javier, could we watch this here?
My vCR is broken.

591
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:03,562
Don't worry, Pedro.
She's a sweetheart.

592
00:39:03,727 --> 00:39:07,561
You have lots in common.
Leave the conversation to me.

593
00:39:07,727 --> 00:39:10,560
-Yeah, but I need to watch this.
-I'll go change.

594
00:39:10,727 --> 00:39:13,195
-You really want to watch this?
-R eal quick.

595
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:15,797
-Is it long?
-I don't think so.

596
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:17,958
Antonio Sagaz? Who's that?

597
00:39:18,127 --> 00:39:19,879
The detective I hired
to follow Paula.

598
00:39:20,327 --> 00:39:23,956
That tape must be of her
and her new stud boyfriend.

599
00:39:24,927 --> 00:39:29,523
Enough already! You're sick.
How could you do such a thing?

600
00:39:29,687 --> 00:39:31,803
-Well...
-That tape goes in the trash.

601
00:39:31,967 --> 00:39:34,959
-It cost me a fortune!
-And then what'll you do?

602
00:39:35,127 --> 00:39:37,516
Pay some thug
to kick the guy's ass?

603
00:39:38,527 --> 00:39:39,562
Hold still!

604
00:39:42,127 --> 00:39:43,276
Get off me!

605
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:46,246
-Sonia!
-Give it.

606
00:39:46,407 --> 00:39:47,522
Sonia!

607
00:39:48,087 --> 00:39:49,998
Hey! What's going on here?

608
00:39:53,847 --> 00:39:57,396
Stop that! You're like children.
What's the problem?

609
00:39:57,647 --> 00:39:58,875
-Know what he did?
-What?

610
00:39:59,047 --> 00:40:02,039
He hired a detective
to follow Paula around.

611
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,886
You really did that?

612
00:40:05,727 --> 00:40:07,797
-What's so funny?
-That's enough.

613
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:11,960
He made a mistake, so what?
Look what you did to his shirt.

614
00:40:13,487 --> 00:40:15,205
She's here. You're ready.
Pedro!

615
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:18,282
-Calm down.
-Whatever you do,

616
00:40:18,447 --> 00:40:21,200
-forget Paula.
-I'll get one of Javier's shirts.

617
00:40:21,687 --> 00:40:23,439
This girl's perfect for you.

618
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:27,123
She could be the one.
Don't give him my green shirt.

619
00:40:27,647 --> 00:40:29,080
I'll throw this away.

620
00:40:34,087 --> 00:40:35,281
Hi.

621
00:40:36,127 --> 00:40:37,879
Right on time!

622
00:40:38,207 --> 00:40:39,640
Come on up.

623
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,685
You're right.

624
00:41:04,847 --> 00:41:08,044
This can't go on.
Paula can see whoever she wants.

625
00:41:08,527 --> 00:41:09,516
Right.

626
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:12,521
And you could fall in love again
at any time.

627
00:41:13,927 --> 00:41:15,076
Come here.

628
00:41:16,567 --> 00:41:17,682
-Come here.
-What?

629
00:41:17,847 --> 00:41:19,678
You put your shirt on wrong.

630
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:25,245
I've put on weight anyway.
I'm too chubby.

631
00:41:26,407 --> 00:41:28,523
Maybe I should leave it untucked.

632
00:41:29,407 --> 00:41:32,444
Even if you tucked
your shirt in,

633
00:41:33,047 --> 00:41:36,403
I'm sure she'd love you.
You'll see.

634
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:47,241
You like it, Pedro?

635
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:53,116
-Yeah, it's good.
-What a coincidence! I think so too.

636
00:41:53,647 --> 00:41:56,639
Pasta is my favorite food.

637
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,077
Macaroni, spaghetti,

638
00:41:59,247 --> 00:42:01,920
-cannelloni, ravioli, lasagna...
-Pilar.

639
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:03,964
Pedro adores pasta.

640
00:42:04,127 --> 00:42:05,640
R eally?

641
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,643
-Yeah, I like it.
-More than that.

642
00:42:08,807 --> 00:42:10,081
It drives him crazy.

643
00:42:10,247 --> 00:42:12,238
As a kid that's all he ate.

644
00:42:12,967 --> 00:42:17,085
Fettuccini, tortellini,
and those little ties...

645
00:42:17,807 --> 00:42:19,877
-Bow-tie.
-Right.

646
00:42:20,087 --> 00:42:22,203
The best thing
about Italian food

647
00:42:22,367 --> 00:42:27,361
is you can do so much with it:
with tomato, salads, with cheese...

648
00:42:27,527 --> 00:42:28,880
With garlic.

649
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,446
Like in a Chinese soup.

650
00:42:30,607 --> 00:42:33,804
With shrimp, mushrooms...

651
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:37,042
Pilar, tell us about yourself.

652
00:42:37,367 --> 00:42:40,325
-How long have you worked there?
-Two months and 1 1 days.

653
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:43,927
You know what Pedro loves to do?

654
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:46,444
-To stroll.
-No!

655
00:42:47,207 --> 00:42:48,606
So do I!

656
00:42:49,207 --> 00:42:52,882
In the street, the park,
the weekend, in the rain...

657
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:57,727
-Yeah, it's okay.
-Well.

658
00:42:57,887 --> 00:43:00,606
Javier's the one
who loves to stroll.

659
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:04,079
I remember he used to walk
all the time.

660
00:43:04,247 --> 00:43:06,841
In the morning, on the sidewalk,

661
00:43:07,007 --> 00:43:09,282
-across bridges...
-Down the street...

662
00:43:09,447 --> 00:43:10,960
You never told me.

663
00:43:13,447 --> 00:43:15,517
I used to like it much more.

664
00:43:15,687 --> 00:43:20,078
But Pedro absolutely loves it.
Pedro walks everywhere.

665
00:43:20,247 --> 00:43:22,477
Normally he'd be walking around
as we speak.

666
00:43:22,647 --> 00:43:24,717
Exactly like me. Exactly.

667
00:43:25,207 --> 00:43:27,437
You two can go for a stroll later.

668
00:43:27,887 --> 00:43:30,037
Yeah, and we'll talk some more.

669
00:43:30,247 --> 00:43:31,521
Get to know each other.

670
00:43:31,687 --> 00:43:33,279
It's so hard to find someone

671
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:35,722
who you have so much
in common with.

672
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:37,875
This is great, Pedro.

673
00:43:38,047 --> 00:43:42,404
I'm so happy. I'm really counting
on the success of our relationship.

674
00:43:42,967 --> 00:43:46,846
That's everything.
Now if you compare these monkeys

675
00:43:47,007 --> 00:43:50,317
to the people around you,
you'll find many similarities.

676
00:43:50,927 --> 00:43:52,565
Any questions?

677
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:54,679
Don't be shy. You've got

678
00:43:54,847 --> 00:43:56,041
plenty of questions.

679
00:43:57,127 --> 00:43:58,355
He's a good speaker.

680
00:43:59,207 --> 00:44:00,925
And so handsome, too.

681
00:44:01,087 --> 00:44:02,156
He's my boyfriend.

682
00:44:02,327 --> 00:44:04,921
-Together long?
-No, actually we met

683
00:44:05,087 --> 00:44:07,681
last night,
but it was love at first sight.

684
00:44:08,047 --> 00:44:10,436
Did someone introduce you to him?

685
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:13,644
A colleague of mine from work.
Javier.

686
00:44:13,967 --> 00:44:17,357
-At a party?
-No, at his house.

687
00:44:17,527 --> 00:44:20,837
-Then we went to dinner.
-What kind of restaurant?

688
00:44:21,007 --> 00:44:24,283
An Italian place.
We both adore Italian food.

689
00:44:25,047 --> 00:44:26,036
So do I.

690
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:29,802
Did you meet him here today
or did you come to surprise him?

691
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:32,800
The truth is,
I came to tell him something.

692
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:37,326
There's something
I want to tell you.

693
00:44:37,487 --> 00:44:39,478
It's important,
at least to me.

694
00:44:40,247 --> 00:44:42,556
I haven't slept all night,
because

695
00:44:42,727 --> 00:44:45,799
there's something
I need to hear you say...

696
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,564
Tell me that you love me.

697
00:44:55,207 --> 00:44:57,675
Tell me that you love me.

698
00:44:59,887 --> 00:45:02,481
I'm sad and I need to know...

699
00:45:02,647 --> 00:45:05,320
if you really love me
like yesterday.

700
00:45:05,487 --> 00:45:07,876
It might seem silly
but I'm going to ask you

701
00:45:08,047 --> 00:45:10,959
to say it again and again
and again.

702
00:45:15,047 --> 00:45:16,526
Tell me that you love me.

703
00:45:20,487 --> 00:45:22,682
Tell me that you love me.

704
00:45:40,207 --> 00:45:42,163
Tell me that you love me.

705
00:45:45,887 --> 00:45:47,798
Tell her that you love her.

706
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,920
Tell me that you love me.

707
00:46:07,127 --> 00:46:09,595
I found him a girlfriend,
you know.

708
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,405
-R eally?
-Yes.

709
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:14,286
-Did they hit it off?
-Not quite.

710
00:46:15,167 --> 00:46:17,123
You know how hard it is
for Pedro.

711
00:46:17,287 --> 00:46:21,724
He's a tough nut to crack.
She's cute, very talkative...

712
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:25,158
He probably can't forget you.

713
00:46:26,207 --> 00:46:28,880
You're unforgettable.

714
00:46:29,327 --> 00:46:32,080
-You're so full of shit.
-I'm serious.

715
00:46:33,927 --> 00:46:35,280
What's that?

716
00:46:35,527 --> 00:46:37,404
-What?
-Something strange...

717
00:46:38,047 --> 00:46:39,480
-Where?
-Here.

718
00:46:40,927 --> 00:46:44,522
-We're going to crash.
-Have you always had this?

719
00:46:45,287 --> 00:46:48,324
You must have,
it really stands out.

720
00:46:55,407 --> 00:46:57,398
What a disaster. Nobody came.

721
00:46:57,607 --> 00:47:00,963
Not at all.
Look, seventeen people came.

722
00:47:01,927 --> 00:47:05,237
And seventeen's a good number.

723
00:47:05,407 --> 00:47:07,841
There are more actors here
than spectators.

724
00:47:08,007 --> 00:47:10,760
-The word of mouth will kick in.
-I hope so.

725
00:47:10,927 --> 00:47:12,519
Everything must be perfect.

726
00:47:13,047 --> 00:47:14,719
-Hi, Pedro.
-Hi.

727
00:47:15,527 --> 00:47:18,360
-How are you, Lucia?
-Here's your ticket.

728
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,165
Take one of our flyers.

729
00:47:21,567 --> 00:47:23,125
No, I'm not into that.

730
00:47:23,847 --> 00:47:25,803
Well, you never know for sure.

731
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,602
Pedro!

732
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:30,075
You didn't see me!

733
00:48:29,567 --> 00:48:34,402
Fertility is a gift from the gods

734
00:48:35,047 --> 00:48:39,325
which we mortals,
playthings of the skies above,

735
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:41,725
cannot control.

736
00:48:43,407 --> 00:48:45,716
But I want children.

737
00:48:46,367 --> 00:48:48,358
I want children!

738
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:51,360
I want children.

739
00:48:52,407 --> 00:48:55,399
Children are like the seeds
of a sunflower,

740
00:48:55,567 --> 00:48:58,240
or the cries of lost kittens.

741
00:48:58,807 --> 00:49:01,560
Here we bring
the fertility machine.

742
00:49:01,727 --> 00:49:03,957
Finally I'll know
if I can have children.

743
00:49:10,687 --> 00:49:14,316
What a surprise.
I will not have a child,

744
00:49:15,767 --> 00:49:18,042
I will have a melon.

745
00:49:19,927 --> 00:49:21,155
Say something!

746
00:49:21,327 --> 00:49:22,555
And get up!

747
00:49:26,447 --> 00:49:29,917
I'm the melon boy!

748
00:49:30,527 --> 00:49:32,483
Melon boy!

749
00:49:33,007 --> 00:49:35,521
I'm the melon boy!

750
00:49:41,607 --> 00:49:42,756
Paula.

751
00:49:43,927 --> 00:49:44,837
Paula.

752
00:49:45,927 --> 00:49:46,916
What's in here?

753
00:49:47,167 --> 00:49:48,282
Clothes.

754
00:49:49,927 --> 00:49:51,360
A whole closet full?

755
00:49:54,447 --> 00:49:57,723
This will be the best weekend
of your life.

756
00:50:01,647 --> 00:50:03,842
I can't see. Can I open them?

757
00:50:05,887 --> 00:50:07,115
-Can I...?
-No.

758
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,436
-Wait.
-What is it?

759
00:50:10,847 --> 00:50:11,563
What?

760
00:50:13,127 --> 00:50:14,799
It's a little messy.

761
00:50:15,567 --> 00:50:17,364
You're such a freak!

762
00:50:18,607 --> 00:50:21,167
Well, it's not so bad.
It looks bad.

763
00:50:21,647 --> 00:50:24,081
I can clean this up in 5 minutes.

764
00:50:24,727 --> 00:50:26,957
Listen, this is what we'll do.

765
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:31,285
You go and take a nice,
hot bubble bath...

766
00:50:31,447 --> 00:50:33,802
And this'll be ready in 5 minutes.

767
00:50:33,967 --> 00:50:36,003
What? It's freezing in here.

768
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:38,721
I'll light the chimney.

769
00:50:38,927 --> 00:50:43,000
It's a great chimney. We'll be
warm in no time, you'll see.

770
00:50:44,727 --> 00:50:46,922
Javier, are you going to tell her?

771
00:50:47,807 --> 00:50:50,879
We need to get wood.

772
00:50:51,447 --> 00:50:52,402
Javier.

773
00:50:52,567 --> 00:50:55,479
-What?
-Are you going to tell her?

774
00:50:57,887 --> 00:50:59,639
Of course I'll tell her.

775
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,844
Try to understand,
Sonia's depressed

776
00:51:04,007 --> 00:51:06,475
because she can't find
a job in the paper.

777
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:10,523
She spends all day
lying around pouting.

778
00:51:11,727 --> 00:51:15,242
I told her we won't buy
an apartment. I told her.

779
00:51:16,127 --> 00:51:18,083
Just relax,
let me send my signals.

780
00:51:18,247 --> 00:51:21,523
I'm sick of you and your lies

781
00:51:21,687 --> 00:51:25,316
and your signals. Why do you
make promises you can't keep?

782
00:51:26,087 --> 00:51:27,361
I'm leaving.

783
00:51:27,967 --> 00:51:31,516
Let's go. We can't stay here.
How about a hotel?

784
00:51:32,607 --> 00:51:35,804
-Five star, I'll pay.
-It's too late to find a hotel.

785
00:51:36,807 --> 00:51:39,037
There are tons of hotels
around here.

786
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:46,566
What's that?

787
00:51:49,327 --> 00:51:52,000
Those are pictures of my brother.

788
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,240
What are they doing here?

789
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:12,845
-Should I get it?
-No, I got it.

790
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:17,999
-Hello?
-Hi, Pedro. It's Pilar. I saw you

791
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:22,479
earlier but you disappeared.
Too bad, you'd have loved the play.

792
00:52:22,647 --> 00:52:24,046
It was wonderful.

793
00:52:24,247 --> 00:52:27,717
I was also calling to talk about
something you might like.

794
00:52:27,887 --> 00:52:29,878
It's something I really enjoy.

795
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:32,003
That is, going to the movies.

796
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:34,476
Would you like to go
to the movies?

797
00:52:44,007 --> 00:52:45,360
Honestly.

798
00:52:45,927 --> 00:52:48,680
I don't see why
he's forcing women on you.

799
00:52:49,007 --> 00:52:50,998
You can get any woman you want.

800
00:52:51,207 --> 00:52:52,196
Right.

801
00:52:53,207 --> 00:52:55,641
Excluding the theater group.
They were

802
00:52:55,807 --> 00:52:57,604
pretty upset.
And excluding Paula.

803
00:52:57,767 --> 00:53:01,043
And we'll just exclude
the entire female gender.

804
00:53:01,727 --> 00:53:02,955
Except Pilar...

805
00:53:04,007 --> 00:53:04,837
Okay.

806
00:53:05,087 --> 00:53:08,875
And me. Don't exclude me.

807
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:16,680
Or Paula, because whoever
she's with, she isn't happy.

808
00:53:18,247 --> 00:53:19,999
Pretend I'm Paula.

809
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:23,920
And you come to see me.

810
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:26,115
What would you say?

811
00:53:28,767 --> 00:53:31,281
-Say something.
-Right.

812
00:53:31,887 --> 00:53:32,763
Hi, Paula.

813
00:53:32,967 --> 00:53:35,686
I've come to see you
because you don't seem happy.

814
00:53:36,687 --> 00:53:38,518
Come on, not like that!

815
00:53:39,847 --> 00:53:41,963
You're wrong, Pedro.
I'm in love,

816
00:53:42,127 --> 00:53:44,402
and I hope you get over me, too.

817
00:53:44,567 --> 00:53:45,795
-You see?
-Yeah.

818
00:53:45,967 --> 00:53:47,195
Tell her the truth.

819
00:53:47,847 --> 00:53:51,840
Paula, I can't live without you,
I'm up all night, sleep all day,

820
00:53:52,007 --> 00:53:54,441
this is a total disaster.
Please come back.

821
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:57,641
Sounds like a bolero.

822
00:53:59,407 --> 00:54:01,796
Why do you act like
women are doing you a favor?

823
00:54:01,967 --> 00:54:04,037
-Because I'm a fool.
-Come here.

824
00:54:05,687 --> 00:54:07,405
Now I'm you and you're Paula.

825
00:54:07,807 --> 00:54:09,001
Okay.

826
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:13,086
Hi, Paula. You look gorgeous.

827
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,680
Thank you.

828
00:54:15,207 --> 00:54:16,322
You're fantastic.

829
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:19,316
And you say...

830
00:54:19,487 --> 00:54:21,682
-How are you, Pedro?
-Fine.

831
00:54:22,727 --> 00:54:24,445
But seeing you makes me feel...

832
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:26,916
Give me your hand.

833
00:54:29,247 --> 00:54:30,441
What do you feel?

834
00:54:31,847 --> 00:54:33,166
Two wonderful tits.

835
00:54:34,087 --> 00:54:36,078
No, pretend I'm you.

836
00:54:37,847 --> 00:54:40,236
When I saw you,

837
00:54:41,927 --> 00:54:43,838
my heart just started pounding.

838
00:54:46,287 --> 00:54:48,881
Well, my back's been hurting...

839
00:54:49,647 --> 00:54:51,478
I can't say that!

840
00:54:51,807 --> 00:54:55,197
Yes, you can. It'll work.

841
00:54:55,527 --> 00:54:58,200
-You'll see.
-I could never say that.

842
00:54:58,407 --> 00:55:02,036
I'd just end up whimpering
and begging her not to leave me.

843
00:55:02,207 --> 00:55:03,481
This is a contest.

844
00:55:03,647 --> 00:55:05,683
You have other things to offer.

845
00:55:05,847 --> 00:55:08,281
Yeah? Like what, for example?

846
00:55:09,167 --> 00:55:11,078
I bet he's more handsome.

847
00:55:11,647 --> 00:55:12,841
Well.

848
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,760
I bet you're taller.

849
00:55:15,207 --> 00:55:17,437
Yeah, but she has more fun
with him.

850
00:55:18,927 --> 00:55:20,155
That won't last.

851
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:23,157
I'll bet he never shuts up.

852
00:55:24,047 --> 00:55:25,924
No, because he's filthy rich.

853
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:29,404
Huge car, dinner at the Ritz
every night

854
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:32,003
in a suit and tie...

855
00:55:33,447 --> 00:55:37,281
-I'll bet they go Dutch.
-No, he's a man of the world.

856
00:55:37,447 --> 00:55:40,598
With experience and
a receding hairline.

857
00:55:41,367 --> 00:55:43,722
R eceding fast, like his car!

858
00:55:45,087 --> 00:55:48,523
You, on the other hand,
have beautiful curly hair.

859
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,318
But he's a better lay.

860
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:01,566
I doubt it.

861
00:56:02,127 --> 00:56:04,118
He isn't half as sweet as you.

862
00:56:09,127 --> 00:56:10,685
You want a glass of milk?

863
00:56:12,007 --> 00:56:13,201
A glass of milk?

864
00:56:13,367 --> 00:56:18,236
Yeah, it settles my stomach
at night.

865
00:56:18,767 --> 00:56:20,485
But if you want something else...

866
00:56:21,727 --> 00:56:24,161
Okay, a nice glass of milk.

867
00:56:24,487 --> 00:56:27,001
-But heat it up.
-Right.

868
00:56:32,687 --> 00:56:34,564
-The milk.
-What?

869
00:56:37,247 --> 00:56:41,638
I can bring it with donuts or
with cookies. I prefer donuts.

870
00:56:42,927 --> 00:56:44,121
Why?

871
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,119
Well, because...

872
00:56:48,007 --> 00:56:49,963
I really love

873
00:56:50,967 --> 00:56:52,764
soaking them in the milk

874
00:56:53,807 --> 00:56:56,367
and they get all soft

875
00:56:56,527 --> 00:56:58,518
and melt in your mouth.

876
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:06,206
-Yeah.
-Milk again.

877
00:57:08,727 --> 00:57:10,957
I could bring chocolate milk.

878
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:13,243
Or coffee-flavored.

879
00:57:15,407 --> 00:57:16,556
Coffee-flavored.

880
00:57:27,367 --> 00:57:28,482
Rafa.

881
00:57:31,607 --> 00:57:32,926
We have to talk.

882
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:35,198
Wait a sec.

883
00:57:37,367 --> 00:57:38,595
It's important.

884
00:57:39,167 --> 00:57:40,919
Just wait, victoria.

885
00:57:43,367 --> 00:57:44,766
There we go!

886
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:46,042
Go ahead.

887
00:57:47,687 --> 00:57:51,475
First of all,
I want you to know that I love you.

888
00:57:52,607 --> 00:57:53,835
And I'm sorry.

889
00:57:54,487 --> 00:57:55,886
But I'm in love.

890
00:57:56,727 --> 00:57:59,036
I've been seeing someone else.

891
00:57:59,967 --> 00:58:04,324
I didn't want to tell you
until I was completely sure.

892
00:58:05,687 --> 00:58:08,281
I think we should break up.

893
00:58:15,847 --> 00:58:17,519
Can I ask you a question?

894
00:58:19,367 --> 00:58:20,561
Yes.

895
00:58:21,607 --> 00:58:23,484
Could you please explain

896
00:58:24,927 --> 00:58:27,680
how could you be such a bitch?

897
00:58:28,407 --> 00:58:30,523
Because you're a real bitch.

898
00:58:32,087 --> 00:58:33,315
And you know what?

899
00:58:33,727 --> 00:58:35,877
While you were out with
that fool

900
00:58:36,047 --> 00:58:39,323
I've fucked 1 5, 20,
maybe 30 chicks,

901
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:43,400
all hotter than you.
Which isn't difficult, you're ugly.

902
00:58:45,407 --> 00:58:47,238
You are ugly as fuck.

903
00:58:48,127 --> 00:58:49,480
And you know what else?

904
00:58:49,847 --> 00:58:53,283
These have been the worst years
of my life. I can't stand you.

905
00:58:53,687 --> 00:58:55,803
You don't know how happy
this makes me.

906
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:59,439
You say the stupidest things.
You're a fucking idiot.

907
00:58:59,807 --> 00:59:02,196
And you stink. And...

908
00:59:03,887 --> 00:59:06,720
I faked every orgasm
I ever had with you!

909
00:59:12,687 --> 00:59:15,155
Go find yourself a brain
on sale somewhere!

910
00:59:37,007 --> 00:59:38,156
Hey.

911
00:59:38,487 --> 00:59:40,239
Don't worry about anything.

912
00:59:40,967 --> 00:59:45,085
Yeah, but that first time
wasn't typical for me.

913
00:59:46,687 --> 00:59:50,600
That's never happened to me before.
The second time was better.

914
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,406
That's not what I mean.

915
00:59:52,567 --> 00:59:54,159
-It's not?
-No.

916
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:56,600
I mean about Javier.

917
01:00:10,207 --> 01:00:14,120
What matters most
is he'll never find out.

918
01:00:15,167 --> 01:00:17,158
These things happen, right?

919
01:00:18,367 --> 01:00:20,597
So the first time
was no big deal.

920
01:00:20,767 --> 01:00:22,325
No, silly.

921
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:40,965
I'll give you a 7.5.

922
01:00:41,127 --> 01:00:42,526
-Okay?
-Okay.

923
01:00:48,087 --> 01:00:52,126
-Happy?
-7.5 isn't bad.

924
01:00:54,647 --> 01:00:57,081
Left home with a smile
on my face.

925
01:00:57,247 --> 01:01:00,080
Today I got up with ease.

926
01:01:00,327 --> 01:01:02,966
The morning sun shines
on my face.

927
01:01:03,287 --> 01:01:06,324
Woken by a cool breeze.
Hey...

928
01:01:11,727 --> 01:01:14,446
The city's my friend.

929
01:01:14,607 --> 01:01:17,075
Today's my day,
nobody gets in my way.

930
01:01:17,327 --> 01:01:20,080
The girls on the corner
are giggling.

931
01:01:20,247 --> 01:01:22,442
I know what they want,
and that's okay.

932
01:01:22,607 --> 01:01:23,881
Jump, I say.

933
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:25,844
Jump with me.

934
01:01:26,007 --> 01:01:28,680
-Jump!
-Jump with me.

935
01:01:28,967 --> 01:01:31,686
-Jump!
-Jump with me.

936
01:01:31,847 --> 01:01:34,486
-Jump!
-Jump with me.

937
01:01:46,047 --> 01:01:48,686
Walking down the street,
not a worry in sight.

938
01:01:49,127 --> 01:01:51,687
People walk by,
their gazes may bite...

939
01:01:51,847 --> 01:01:54,645
But I don't mind,
I don't care at all.

940
01:01:54,807 --> 01:01:58,516
Today's my day and I want to jump.
Jump, I say.

941
01:01:58,927 --> 01:02:01,316
-Jump with me.
-Jump!

942
01:02:01,767 --> 01:02:04,201
-Jump with me.
-Jump!

943
01:02:04,367 --> 01:02:06,927
-Jump with me.
-Jump!

944
01:02:09,327 --> 01:02:11,682
Left home with a smile
on my face.

945
01:02:11,847 --> 01:02:14,361
Today I got up with ease.

946
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:17,445
The morning sun shines
on my face.

947
01:02:17,687 --> 01:02:20,360
Woken by a cool breeze.
Hey...

948
01:02:20,527 --> 01:02:23,121
-Jump!
-Jump with me.

949
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:25,636
-Jump!
-Jump with me.

950
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:28,806
-Jump!
-Jump with me.

951
01:02:29,087 --> 01:02:31,317
-Jump!
-Jump with me.

952
01:02:34,047 --> 01:02:35,560
Jump with me.

953
01:02:36,887 --> 01:02:38,320
Jump with me.

954
01:02:40,447 --> 01:02:41,800
Jump with me.

955
01:02:41,967 --> 01:02:43,286
Jump with me.

956
01:02:58,607 --> 01:02:59,676
Javier?

957
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:03,636
-Hi.
-Hi.

958
01:03:04,087 --> 01:03:09,036
-Weren't you coming back tomorrow?
-The company president died.

959
01:03:09,847 --> 01:03:13,237
Right, I mean his wife.
Poor thing.

960
01:03:13,887 --> 01:03:15,559
They cancelled the meeting.

961
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:17,559
You didn't sleep here?

962
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:20,602
No, I slept at Pedro's.

963
01:03:21,247 --> 01:03:23,397
We went back to his place
after dinner.

964
01:03:24,407 --> 01:03:27,365
It was late so
I just spent the night there.

965
01:03:35,807 --> 01:03:36,762
Pedro.

966
01:03:37,327 --> 01:03:38,442
What?

967
01:03:39,847 --> 01:03:41,724
Did Sonia sleep at your place?

968
01:03:47,927 --> 01:03:48,996
No.

969
01:03:51,007 --> 01:03:52,759
Why would she do that?

970
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,516
Are you sure?

971
01:03:55,687 --> 01:03:57,643
Of course I'm sure.

972
01:03:58,527 --> 01:03:59,755
I knew it.

973
01:04:00,847 --> 01:04:02,280
She cheated on me.

974
01:04:02,447 --> 01:04:04,597
She didn't sleep at my place!

975
01:04:04,767 --> 01:04:08,077
I know, she said she slept there
after the play.

976
01:04:08,527 --> 01:04:10,040
What a liar!

977
01:04:10,567 --> 01:04:11,841
The bitch.

978
01:04:13,967 --> 01:04:15,241
Who was she with?

979
01:04:17,847 --> 01:04:20,600
Probably some ex-boyfriend.

980
01:04:20,767 --> 01:04:23,486
No, she couldn't have been.

981
01:04:26,647 --> 01:04:30,196
That's it!
The other day at the theater

982
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,198
she was talking to...

983
01:04:34,327 --> 01:04:35,521
Lucia.

984
01:04:36,167 --> 01:04:37,236
So what?

985
01:04:37,647 --> 01:04:40,445
They were whispering
in each other's ear

986
01:04:40,607 --> 01:04:42,040
the whole time.

987
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:45,999
And... well, forget it.

988
01:04:46,167 --> 01:04:47,680
And what, Pedro?

989
01:04:47,847 --> 01:04:48,962
It's just that...

990
01:04:49,127 --> 01:04:51,595
Sonia's been seeing
a lot of Lucia lately.

991
01:04:52,967 --> 01:04:55,242
Always hugging and kissing,

992
01:04:56,527 --> 01:04:58,165
and Lucia's a...

993
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,319
You know what I mean.

994
01:05:02,087 --> 01:05:04,043
No. What do you mean?

995
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:07,565
She might be involved with Lucia.

996
01:05:07,727 --> 01:05:10,195
How the hell
could they be involved?

997
01:05:13,087 --> 01:05:14,964
Because we're all bisexual.

998
01:05:15,407 --> 01:05:18,763
Friends fall in love
with each other all the time.

999
01:05:19,607 --> 01:05:20,960
Please.

1000
01:05:27,927 --> 01:05:31,840
The other day I said something
about lesbians

1001
01:05:32,007 --> 01:05:36,125
and she freaked out.
And she doesn't dress very feminine.

1002
01:05:37,047 --> 01:05:38,924
Checkered shirts, right?

1003
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:43,757
-And her hair.
-What about it?

1004
01:05:45,487 --> 01:05:46,602
She wants to cut it.

1005
01:05:47,407 --> 01:05:48,635
There you have it.

1006
01:05:49,767 --> 01:05:52,235
Short hair, checkered shirts.
She's a dyke.

1007
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:54,398
You're lucky to be rid of her.

1008
01:06:00,367 --> 01:06:01,846
My girlfriend's a lesbian.

1009
01:06:16,887 --> 01:06:19,242
-How are you?
-Fine.

1010
01:06:23,607 --> 01:06:25,643
-It's cold out.
-Yeah.

1011
01:06:30,727 --> 01:06:32,843
Do you want to do this?

1012
01:06:33,007 --> 01:06:34,201
Not really.

1013
01:06:35,767 --> 01:06:37,564
-Should we forget it?
-Yeah.

1014
01:06:38,967 --> 01:06:41,276
-Do you mind?
-I prefer it this way.

1015
01:06:54,887 --> 01:06:56,240
What do I tell him?

1016
01:06:57,607 --> 01:06:58,960
I don't know.

1017
01:06:59,847 --> 01:07:02,441
Say you slept...

1018
01:07:03,087 --> 01:07:05,601
I don't know, at Lucia's.

1019
01:07:06,447 --> 01:07:08,358
That you went there
after the play.

1020
01:07:10,687 --> 01:07:12,006
All right.

1021
01:07:12,567 --> 01:07:15,525
Yeah, I'll tell him
I slept at Lucia's and

1022
01:07:15,727 --> 01:07:19,959
didn't tell him because he always
knocks my theater friends.

1023
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:22,039
-Right?
-Fine.

1024
01:07:33,327 --> 01:07:36,763
You're such a brute!

1025
01:07:37,927 --> 01:07:40,441
-You tore them. Look.
-Yeah.

1026
01:07:41,647 --> 01:07:44,115
What's my score?

1027
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:49,727
I'll give you...

1028
01:07:50,007 --> 01:07:52,885
-an 8.25.
-An 8.25!

1029
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:55,876
-And improving.
-Almost perfect.

1030
01:08:02,007 --> 01:08:03,235
-I have to go.
-No.

1031
01:08:03,407 --> 01:08:04,635
-Yes, I do.
-No.

1032
01:08:04,807 --> 01:08:06,126
Get off!

1033
01:08:06,287 --> 01:08:07,766
I'll get caught.

1034
01:08:07,967 --> 01:08:10,117
Look what time it is.

1035
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:12,840
And with no panties.

1036
01:09:24,967 --> 01:09:26,525
Melon boy!

1037
01:09:28,567 --> 01:09:30,319
Melon boy!

1038
01:09:34,527 --> 01:09:36,279
I'm the melon boy!

1039
01:09:38,087 --> 01:09:39,839
Melon boy!

1040
01:10:13,847 --> 01:10:15,121
Javier.

1041
01:10:26,527 --> 01:10:27,880
What are you doing here?

1042
01:10:30,847 --> 01:10:32,405
Why are you naked?

1043
01:10:46,127 --> 01:10:47,560
I missed you.

1044
01:10:55,927 --> 01:10:57,485
Do you still like me?

1045
01:11:00,327 --> 01:11:01,680
Do I still like you?

1046
01:11:03,727 --> 01:11:05,319
Of course I do.

1047
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:19,235
And your boyfriend?

1048
01:11:19,847 --> 01:11:20,996
Forget him.

1049
01:11:22,847 --> 01:11:24,041
Isn't he more fun?

1050
01:11:24,967 --> 01:11:26,559
He talks too much.

1051
01:11:28,047 --> 01:11:30,880
Won't you miss all the restaurants

1052
01:11:31,127 --> 01:11:33,038
and cars and fancy places?

1053
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:36,685
What? We always went Dutch.

1054
01:11:39,927 --> 01:11:42,487
But physically...
He must be more handsome.

1055
01:11:42,767 --> 01:11:44,678
Well, he isn't. No.

1056
01:11:47,047 --> 01:11:50,483
I prefer you and your curly hair.

1057
01:12:02,807 --> 01:12:04,035
But he's a better lay...

1058
01:12:06,287 --> 01:12:08,926
-We'll soon find out!
-No, no.

1059
01:12:09,887 --> 01:12:11,525
I can't right now because

1060
01:12:11,767 --> 01:12:13,200
I won't be able to.

1061
01:12:13,607 --> 01:12:14,676
Why not?

1062
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:16,519
Because I was...

1063
01:12:17,527 --> 01:12:19,245
I was bored and alone

1064
01:12:19,407 --> 01:12:20,601
in bed and I...

1065
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:22,839
I jerked off a bit.

1066
01:12:23,007 --> 01:12:24,406
We'll have to wait.

1067
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:26,206
-You jerked off?
-Yes.

1068
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:29,359
-Let's check it out.
-No, don't bother.

1069
01:12:29,527 --> 01:12:33,202
It's no use,
it's a question of nature.

1070
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:37,282
We all have glands and
other wonderful mechanisms

1071
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:41,243
that need time to rehabilitate.

1072
01:12:43,647 --> 01:12:46,923
You never know how long,
but when it says no...

1073
01:12:47,847 --> 01:12:51,123
It's saying: ''Wait a bit
while I reload the chamber''.

1074
01:12:52,767 --> 01:12:54,086
Shit.

1075
01:12:55,727 --> 01:12:57,319
It's nature's way.

1076
01:12:58,167 --> 01:13:00,397
Like it or not...

1077
01:13:01,367 --> 01:13:04,677
You see?
That only took 30 seconds.

1078
01:13:08,047 --> 01:13:11,164
Fucking bitch!

1079
01:13:23,447 --> 01:13:25,563
-Hi, honey.
-Hi.

1080
01:13:35,727 --> 01:13:37,001
Where were you?

1081
01:13:38,807 --> 01:13:40,035
At Lucia's.

1082
01:13:42,487 --> 01:13:43,636
And you?

1083
01:13:44,047 --> 01:13:45,400
Why are you reading that?

1084
01:13:46,487 --> 01:13:47,556
You know.

1085
01:13:48,927 --> 01:13:50,758
Men like this stuff.

1086
01:13:52,647 --> 01:13:54,763
-What about you?
-Me?

1087
01:13:56,527 --> 01:13:59,360
I guess she does have
a great body.

1088
01:14:01,367 --> 01:14:04,200
But I don't like those
macho magazines.

1089
01:14:05,167 --> 01:14:06,441
They're not macho.

1090
01:14:07,647 --> 01:14:09,603
They're directed at men

1091
01:14:10,407 --> 01:14:11,726
and also lesbians.

1092
01:14:17,607 --> 01:14:19,006
I bet Lucia reads them.

1093
01:14:19,687 --> 01:14:22,599
-Don't start with that.
-Fine, sorry.

1094
01:14:23,407 --> 01:14:26,797
Forgive me. You always get
so upset when I mention Lucia.

1095
01:14:28,207 --> 01:14:30,482
You're so sensitive
about her.

1096
01:14:35,767 --> 01:14:37,325
Why were you at her place?

1097
01:14:39,087 --> 01:14:41,317
Why were you over there?

1098
01:14:48,407 --> 01:14:49,396
Well...

1099
01:14:52,407 --> 01:14:55,638
Look, I have a confession to make.

1100
01:15:00,847 --> 01:15:02,246
Good, fine.

1101
01:15:04,367 --> 01:15:05,322
Go ahead.

1102
01:15:06,687 --> 01:15:10,236
I didn't sleep at Pedro's,
I slept at Lucia's.

1103
01:15:12,327 --> 01:15:16,400
I lied because you always knock
my theater friends.

1104
01:15:16,567 --> 01:15:18,842
I thought you'd be upset.

1105
01:15:20,487 --> 01:15:24,924
So I had to go back because
I lost an earring there.

1106
01:15:25,767 --> 01:15:27,837
But I couldn't find it, and...

1107
01:15:31,047 --> 01:15:32,196
And?

1108
01:15:35,207 --> 01:15:36,481
And that's it.

1109
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:48,277
If I tell Javier
I slept with Paula,

1110
01:15:48,447 --> 01:15:50,199
he'll tell Sonia.

1111
01:15:50,447 --> 01:15:52,597
-I don't want...
-...Javier to know because

1112
01:15:52,767 --> 01:15:55,122
I'm still not sure what I want.

1113
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,556
I love them...

1114
01:15:58,727 --> 01:16:01,560
...both and I don't want
to mess things up.

1115
01:16:02,447 --> 01:16:04,756
This was the best night
of my life.

1116
01:16:06,207 --> 01:16:08,596
But I don't know if things
with Paula...

1117
01:16:08,767 --> 01:16:11,042
...will be better than they were.

1118
01:16:21,047 --> 01:16:24,926
I love Pedro, but I also love
Javier, and our problems...

1119
01:16:25,087 --> 01:16:27,681
...might be fixable
or they might be too serious...

1120
01:16:27,847 --> 01:16:31,203
Pedro, I think we need
to take things slowly.

1121
01:16:31,367 --> 01:16:32,561
Right?

1122
01:16:34,047 --> 01:16:36,197
-Yeah, sounds good.
-It's for the best.

1123
01:16:38,607 --> 01:16:39,926
No way.

1124
01:16:40,087 --> 01:16:41,759
No fucking way.

1125
01:16:42,287 --> 01:16:44,482
-You know who it is?
-Not yet.

1126
01:16:45,887 --> 01:16:47,002
That's nothing.

1127
01:16:47,847 --> 01:16:51,806
Sonia's cheating on me
with a lesbian.

1128
01:16:52,167 --> 01:16:55,364
-I'll find you a nice girl.
-Even if she's not...

1129
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:56,846
Sonia with a chick?

1130
01:16:58,927 --> 01:17:02,124
-Yeah, lesbians are...
-They're all bitches.

1131
01:17:04,247 --> 01:17:06,238
Would you cheat on her
with a guy?

1132
01:17:06,567 --> 01:17:09,639
No, because you're a gentleman,
you have class.

1133
01:17:10,087 --> 01:17:12,965
But not her.
She finds herself a chick.

1134
01:17:13,127 --> 01:17:15,004
A dyke from her theater group.

1135
01:17:15,167 --> 01:17:16,885
A fucking dyke!

1136
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:21,357
-They're evil, all of them.
-They screw you!

1137
01:17:21,527 --> 01:17:24,803
And you know why?
Because they don't fuck for real.

1138
01:17:26,487 --> 01:17:27,806
Here's the plan.

1139
01:17:28,287 --> 01:17:29,800
Know what we'll do?

1140
01:17:31,967 --> 01:17:33,366
We'll get revenge.

1141
01:17:40,407 --> 01:17:41,601
Good morning.

1142
01:17:45,847 --> 01:17:48,486
LUCIA COBOS IS A LESBIAN

1143
01:17:54,647 --> 01:17:58,640
LUCIA FR OM THE SIXTH FLOOR
IS A TOTAL LESBIAN

1144
01:18:06,407 --> 01:18:07,522
Hi.

1145
01:18:09,967 --> 01:18:11,036
Andres.

1146
01:18:11,207 --> 01:18:12,765
You won't believe it.

1147
01:18:19,727 --> 01:18:22,525
LUCIA IS HETER O, DON'T BE FOOLED

1148
01:18:22,687 --> 01:18:25,042
-How do I look?
-Fine.

1149
01:18:25,207 --> 01:18:27,084
You have to be careful.

1150
01:18:27,447 --> 01:18:29,165
Make sure he's a pro.

1151
01:18:29,327 --> 01:18:31,363
-Okay.
-And don't tell anyone.

1152
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:36,764
Not Carlos, not Javier, no one.
They'll tell everybody.

1153
01:18:36,967 --> 01:18:37,922
This is it.

1154
01:18:40,047 --> 01:18:43,483
So Kennedy placed rifles
in the street

1155
01:18:44,047 --> 01:18:46,402
and fired them
with a remote control?

1156
01:18:46,567 --> 01:18:48,000
-Exactly.
-Crazy bastard!

1157
01:18:48,167 --> 01:18:49,646
I see you like my work.

1158
01:18:49,967 --> 01:18:52,003
Did you know Marilyn Monroe's
still alive?

1159
01:18:54,407 --> 01:18:58,082
This guy's amazing.
T.I.S. is some badass shit.

1160
01:19:02,087 --> 01:19:05,363
Actually, Kennedy killed himself
after Marilyn faked her death

1161
01:19:05,527 --> 01:19:09,440
and fled to Spain, invited
by Franco, a big movie buff.

1162
01:19:10,887 --> 01:19:15,642
Franco and Marilyn were lovers.
He even built her a palace.

1163
01:19:15,807 --> 01:19:17,479
That crazy Franco!

1164
01:19:18,607 --> 01:19:20,086
So Kennedy killed himself

1165
01:19:20,247 --> 01:19:22,124
-for love.
-Excuse me.

1166
01:19:22,607 --> 01:19:24,245
Could I have my case file?

1167
01:19:24,407 --> 01:19:25,840
I lost my copy.

1168
01:19:26,047 --> 01:19:30,040
I'll need a couple days.
Take a copy of the videotape.

1169
01:19:30,487 --> 01:19:34,162
''Marilyn lived with Elvis Presley
in the mid-eighties

1170
01:19:34,327 --> 01:19:37,637
until she decided to move
to Matalascañas''.

1171
01:19:40,647 --> 01:19:41,796
Elvis is alive?

1172
01:19:44,967 --> 01:19:46,195
The king!

1173
01:19:47,247 --> 01:19:49,715
You're going to sleep together?

1174
01:19:49,887 --> 01:19:51,400
In the same bed?

1175
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:55,159
Would you mind sleeping
on the sofa?

1176
01:19:56,087 --> 01:19:57,839
Lucia's back is hurt.

1177
01:19:58,047 --> 01:20:01,801
I could go to my mother's.
But all the graffiti

1178
01:20:01,967 --> 01:20:04,959
-at my place scared me.
-It's no big deal.

1179
01:20:05,287 --> 01:20:07,482
Just some scribbling
on the wall.

1180
01:20:07,647 --> 01:20:09,524
-No offense.
-No way.

1181
01:20:09,687 --> 01:20:11,086
You're sleeping here.

1182
01:20:11,247 --> 01:20:13,477
If he doesn't like it,
he can sleep at Pedro's.

1183
01:20:13,647 --> 01:20:15,239
Like you did the other night?

1184
01:20:16,647 --> 01:20:19,684
You know what I think?
Your back is just fine.

1185
01:20:19,927 --> 01:20:21,485
You take the sofa

1186
01:20:22,647 --> 01:20:24,478
and Lucia and I get the bed.

1187
01:20:24,647 --> 01:20:27,719
Javier, you and Lucia
can't sleep together!

1188
01:20:29,087 --> 01:20:31,965
Why not? She's a lesbian, right?

1189
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:35,881
-I'm going to bed.
-Me, too.

1190
01:20:36,167 --> 01:20:39,045
Wait! So soon? It's so early.

1191
01:20:40,087 --> 01:20:41,884
We can go have a drink.

1192
01:20:42,047 --> 01:20:44,845
-It's Tuesday.
-Who cares if it's Tuesday?

1193
01:20:45,127 --> 01:20:49,279
Society shouldn't bind us
to only going out on weekends.

1194
01:20:49,527 --> 01:20:51,518
Marcuse said it way back.

1195
01:20:52,207 --> 01:20:54,437
Marcuse, the thinker.

1196
01:20:55,207 --> 01:20:58,995
''To change the world,
go out on weeknights''.

1197
01:20:59,927 --> 01:21:03,840
-Come on.
-Can I use the bathroom first?

1198
01:21:04,407 --> 01:21:05,442
No.

1199
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:09,240
Pay no attention to me.

1200
01:21:14,287 --> 01:21:15,436
There's a movie on.

1201
01:21:16,887 --> 01:21:18,115
It's a good one.

1202
01:21:20,047 --> 01:21:21,241
''Just R evenge''.

1203
01:21:23,447 --> 01:21:24,880
I haven't seen it.

1204
01:21:25,127 --> 01:21:27,561
You haven't? It's really good.

1205
01:21:27,887 --> 01:21:30,606
It's about a very gentle man
who finds his wife

1206
01:21:31,567 --> 01:21:33,080
in bed with someone else

1207
01:21:34,447 --> 01:21:35,562
and kills them both.

1208
01:21:35,967 --> 01:21:37,366
Blew their brains out.

1209
01:21:37,767 --> 01:21:41,442
''Just R evenge''.
Don't you just love the title?

1210
01:21:44,247 --> 01:21:47,842
Later they're showing a documentary
about O.J. Simpson.

1211
01:21:49,047 --> 01:21:50,366
R eally?

1212
01:21:51,567 --> 01:21:54,400
Life sure is dangerous,
don't you think?

1213
01:22:16,647 --> 01:22:18,763
What's going on here?

1214
01:22:20,407 --> 01:22:21,999
What are you doing?

1215
01:22:24,607 --> 01:22:26,802
The sofa sucks!

1216
01:22:28,247 --> 01:22:29,760
My back's killing me.

1217
01:22:31,287 --> 01:22:33,278
I can't sleep.

1218
01:22:33,887 --> 01:22:36,037
And you two here in bed...

1219
01:23:29,927 --> 01:23:34,318
I miss the unmade bed,

1220
01:23:34,567 --> 01:23:37,684
your orange juice,

1221
01:23:38,127 --> 01:23:40,595
magazines left open...

1222
01:23:40,767 --> 01:23:45,477
I can't find your gaze
in the mirror,

1223
01:23:46,087 --> 01:23:48,840
no kisses in the shower,

1224
01:23:49,567 --> 01:23:51,398
no hair clogging the drain.

1225
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:56,723
There's a wall between us,

1226
01:23:57,647 --> 01:23:59,956
we can't see each other

1227
01:24:00,607 --> 01:24:03,041
or grope each other.

1228
01:24:03,207 --> 01:24:07,917
I twist and turn all night.

1229
01:24:08,447 --> 01:24:11,359
I find cobwebs

1230
01:24:11,527 --> 01:24:14,121
between the sheets.

1231
01:24:15,367 --> 01:24:18,404
As much as I miss you now,

1232
01:24:18,607 --> 01:24:20,598
you were once too much for me.

1233
01:24:21,167 --> 01:24:24,842
Don't take yourself for granted,
without you

1234
01:24:25,007 --> 01:24:27,521
life is such a bore.

1235
01:24:27,687 --> 01:24:30,076
Don't just sit and watch as

1236
01:24:30,247 --> 01:24:33,398
your true love walks out the door.

1237
01:24:33,567 --> 01:24:37,560
Don't take yourself for granted,
without you

1238
01:24:37,727 --> 01:24:40,195
life is such a bore.

1239
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:42,722
Don't just sit and watch as

1240
01:24:42,887 --> 01:24:46,163
your true love walks out the door.

1241
01:24:50,047 --> 01:24:51,878
I miss...

1242
01:24:52,047 --> 01:24:54,242
the crunch of your toast.

1243
01:24:54,407 --> 01:24:57,683
Hearing your cat in the hall

1244
01:24:57,847 --> 01:25:00,361
scratching at the wall.

1245
01:25:00,527 --> 01:25:02,961
In my shirt

1246
01:25:03,327 --> 01:25:05,283
I smell your fresh scent.

1247
01:25:05,447 --> 01:25:08,837
The red from your lips

1248
01:25:09,687 --> 01:25:11,962
spread across my neck.

1249
01:25:12,127 --> 01:25:16,882
There's a wall between us,

1250
01:25:17,287 --> 01:25:20,438
we can't smell each other

1251
01:25:20,607 --> 01:25:22,996
or taste each other.

1252
01:25:23,167 --> 01:25:28,036
I twist and turn all night.

1253
01:25:28,527 --> 01:25:31,166
I find cobwebs

1254
01:25:31,887 --> 01:25:34,082
between the sheets.

1255
01:25:35,447 --> 01:25:38,644
As much as I miss you now,

1256
01:25:38,807 --> 01:25:40,559
you were once too much for me.

1257
01:25:40,727 --> 01:25:44,959
Don't take yourself for granted,
without you

1258
01:25:45,127 --> 01:25:47,595
life is such a bore.

1259
01:25:48,127 --> 01:25:50,163
Don't just sit and watch as

1260
01:25:50,327 --> 01:25:53,478
your true love walks out the door.

1261
01:25:53,687 --> 01:25:57,600
Don't take yourself for granted,
without you

1262
01:25:57,807 --> 01:26:00,446
life is such a bore.

1263
01:26:00,647 --> 01:26:03,036
Don't just sit and watch as

1264
01:26:03,207 --> 01:26:06,005
your true love walks out the door.

1265
01:26:43,087 --> 01:26:44,406
What's up?

1266
01:26:45,167 --> 01:26:46,316
What's up?

1267
01:26:47,567 --> 01:26:50,320
Guess who slept in my bed
with Sonia last night.

1268
01:26:52,527 --> 01:26:53,642
Lucia.

1269
01:26:53,887 --> 01:26:55,286
Rafa's great idea.

1270
01:26:55,447 --> 01:26:57,039
I told him to stop all

1271
01:26:57,207 --> 01:26:58,481
that graffiti crap.

1272
01:26:58,647 --> 01:27:01,684
She was terrified
and came to my place!

1273
01:27:02,167 --> 01:27:05,716
And since her back is hurt,
I ended up on the sofa.

1274
01:27:06,567 --> 01:27:08,717
I spied on them all night.

1275
01:27:09,287 --> 01:27:10,766
But I heard nothing.

1276
01:27:10,927 --> 01:27:13,157
-Maybe they broke up.
-No.

1277
01:27:13,367 --> 01:27:16,165
Lucia just can't please her
like I do.

1278
01:27:16,447 --> 01:27:19,041
When she's with me
she screams a lot.

1279
01:27:19,247 --> 01:27:22,205
Not quite.
She's not much of a screamer.

1280
01:27:22,367 --> 01:27:23,880
Yes, she is!

1281
01:27:24,047 --> 01:27:27,198
She screams her head off.
She goes beserk.

1282
01:27:27,407 --> 01:27:28,681
It even scares me.

1283
01:27:29,047 --> 01:27:33,245
Then you must have had problems
with the neighbors. Paula screams

1284
01:27:33,407 --> 01:27:35,682
and the neighbors...

1285
01:27:36,967 --> 01:27:38,446
Paula's a screamer?

1286
01:27:38,607 --> 01:27:41,440
Paula not only screams,
she howls.

1287
01:27:41,607 --> 01:27:43,199
The neighbors go nuts.

1288
01:27:43,367 --> 01:27:44,959
We've never had any trouble.

1289
01:27:45,167 --> 01:27:46,885
Then she's not a screamer.

1290
01:27:47,047 --> 01:27:51,120
Yes, she is! It's just that
in my place the walls are thick.

1291
01:27:51,287 --> 01:27:53,118
Not like in your shithole.

1292
01:27:53,287 --> 01:27:55,881
Well, how does she scream?
Like...

1293
01:27:56,727 --> 01:27:59,161
''Oh, that feels nice''?
Or does she get

1294
01:27:59,327 --> 01:28:01,363
-biblical?
-Beyond biblical.

1295
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:03,757
No way, stop fucking with me.

1296
01:28:21,127 --> 01:28:22,446
This isn't what you think.

1297
01:28:22,607 --> 01:28:26,839
I broke up with Rafa.
We didn't tell him because

1298
01:28:27,007 --> 01:28:28,520
we didn't want to hurt him.

1299
01:28:30,047 --> 01:28:31,321
Carlos and I are in love.

1300
01:28:32,287 --> 01:28:33,720
We've fallen in love.

1301
01:28:33,887 --> 01:28:35,878
It's normal,
we've lots in common

1302
01:28:36,047 --> 01:28:38,925
and we see each other
all the time.

1303
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:43,326
It happens often between friends.

1304
01:28:44,647 --> 01:28:46,160
Yeah, actually...

1305
01:28:59,447 --> 01:29:01,881
I'm going to the bar
for a snack.

1306
01:29:08,647 --> 01:29:10,524
I've got a call to make.

1307
01:29:14,887 --> 01:29:18,323
-I need to see this tape.
-That's against policy.

1308
01:29:26,927 --> 01:29:30,363
I need a phone number for the
''GuiriGay Association''.

1309
01:29:50,167 --> 01:29:51,919
Hi, I'm calling because

1310
01:29:52,207 --> 01:29:55,961
when Sonia slept at your place
on opening night

1311
01:29:57,127 --> 01:29:58,958
she left an earring there.

1312
01:30:02,367 --> 01:30:04,198
She didn't sleep there?

1313
01:30:07,727 --> 01:30:10,321
Oh, she slept at Pedro's,
right?

1314
01:30:22,847 --> 01:30:24,280
Shit. Sorry.

1315
01:30:36,247 --> 01:30:37,475
Will you serve?

1316
01:30:38,727 --> 01:30:40,206
Serve already!

1317
01:30:50,447 --> 01:30:51,323
Shit!

1318
01:30:53,367 --> 01:30:54,277
A little more...

1319
01:30:56,047 --> 01:30:57,639
You're invading my zone.

1320
01:30:58,407 --> 01:30:59,726
You spoiled my serve.

1321
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:17,718
Damn, sorry.

1322
01:31:19,727 --> 01:31:20,955
Did that hurt?

1323
01:31:23,527 --> 01:31:25,279
Stay out of that area.

1324
01:31:31,927 --> 01:31:33,440
Know what your problem is?

1325
01:31:34,687 --> 01:31:36,962
You think every volley is yours.

1326
01:31:56,687 --> 01:31:58,120
Sorry. It slipped.

1327
01:32:49,487 --> 01:32:52,081
It was definitely my volley.

1328
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:54,523
He came out of nowhere and...

1329
01:32:56,447 --> 01:32:57,846
clobbered me.

1330
01:32:59,687 --> 01:33:02,679
Well, I'm sure you go after
his volleys, too.

1331
01:33:09,887 --> 01:33:12,447
-Pedro.
-What?

1332
01:33:13,887 --> 01:33:16,606
I know I treated you horribly.

1333
01:33:16,767 --> 01:33:19,565
I was thinking maybe
we could try again.

1334
01:33:20,087 --> 01:33:22,999
But not like before.
Much better.

1335
01:33:25,567 --> 01:33:28,604
Hi, Pedro. It's Pilar.
I'm calling to say

1336
01:33:28,767 --> 01:33:33,045
that my parents reserved a table
tomorrow at an Italian restaurant.

1337
01:33:33,287 --> 01:33:34,959
They can't wait to meet you.

1338
01:33:35,127 --> 01:33:37,038
Call me to confirm, okay?

1339
01:33:40,967 --> 01:33:43,322
You'll break up with her, right?

1340
01:33:51,927 --> 01:33:54,122
Hi, Rafa. It's me, Javier.

1341
01:33:54,287 --> 01:33:57,597
We're having a party
next week to celebrate

1342
01:33:57,767 --> 01:34:00,122
Paula and Pedro
getting back together.

1343
01:34:00,727 --> 01:34:03,446
Well, we'll each try to celebrate
whatever we can.

1344
01:34:03,847 --> 01:34:07,556
Call me and I'll tell you what time.

1345
01:34:07,727 --> 01:34:08,842
See you later.

1346
01:34:11,567 --> 01:34:13,797
-Paula.
-Betty!

1347
01:34:20,967 --> 01:34:22,764
-Hi, Rafa.
-What's up?

1348
01:34:25,847 --> 01:34:26,996
What's up?

1349
01:34:30,287 --> 01:34:32,323
Nothing. I brought you a gift.

1350
01:34:33,727 --> 01:34:35,524
-For me?
-Yes.

1351
01:34:36,447 --> 01:34:38,358
What is it?

1352
01:34:41,087 --> 01:34:43,555
-There's a tournament next week.
-Yeah?

1353
01:34:44,207 --> 01:34:45,686
We could sign up.

1354
01:34:46,607 --> 01:34:49,599
-We're a pretty good team.
-Let's do it.

1355
01:34:50,287 --> 01:34:51,879
We're a great team.

1356
01:34:53,247 --> 01:34:54,839
-Careful.
-Sorry.

1357
01:34:55,567 --> 01:34:58,525
What's up?
What are you two doing?

1358
01:34:58,687 --> 01:35:00,803
Who's the guy with Paula?

1359
01:35:02,687 --> 01:35:03,961
Hi, Pedro!

1360
01:35:07,127 --> 01:35:08,640
Pilar. What a surprise.

1361
01:35:09,447 --> 01:35:10,402
Excuse me.

1362
01:35:14,727 --> 01:35:16,445
-Hello.
-Hi.

1363
01:35:17,967 --> 01:35:19,639
-Have we met?
-No.

1364
01:35:19,807 --> 01:35:21,763
Javier, this is Daniel.

1365
01:35:23,607 --> 01:35:26,167
Shit! You're Daniel?

1366
01:35:27,207 --> 01:35:28,879
So glad to meet you.

1367
01:35:29,447 --> 01:35:32,086
I've heard so much about you.
Welcome.

1368
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:34,524
It's a small party, but...

1369
01:35:35,287 --> 01:35:36,845
Size doesn't matter.

1370
01:35:37,407 --> 01:35:39,125
That's what women say.

1371
01:35:46,287 --> 01:35:49,199
-Hi, Rafa.
-How are things, Pedro?

1372
01:35:53,447 --> 01:35:55,085
-Hey, dude.
-Jennifer!

1373
01:35:55,247 --> 01:35:57,044
How are you, gorgeous?

1374
01:35:57,327 --> 01:35:59,318
-Fine, you?
-I'm doing great.

1375
01:35:59,647 --> 01:36:01,763
I want you to meet Lucia.

1376
01:36:01,967 --> 01:36:03,480
Lucia, Jennifer.
Jennifer, Lucia.

1377
01:36:03,767 --> 01:36:05,041
Sonia, you met Jennifer.

1378
01:36:07,687 --> 01:36:09,803
I love your outfit.

1379
01:36:10,047 --> 01:36:11,685
I like yours, too.

1380
01:36:11,847 --> 01:36:12,916
Yeah?

1381
01:36:13,487 --> 01:36:15,205
This is my brother's.

1382
01:36:15,567 --> 01:36:17,444
A friend lent me the shirt.

1383
01:36:21,167 --> 01:36:22,998
You look fantastic.

1384
01:36:25,647 --> 01:36:27,444
You're not so bad yourself.

1385
01:36:28,087 --> 01:36:29,998
Did you make it home all right?

1386
01:36:30,767 --> 01:36:33,361
Yeah, without panties.

1387
01:36:33,527 --> 01:36:35,916
-Yeah?
-But fine.

1388
01:36:36,727 --> 01:36:40,276
-What about Javier?
-Nothing.

1389
01:36:41,567 --> 01:36:44,320
I may have been right
about the ex-boyfriend.

1390
01:36:44,767 --> 01:36:46,246
He's so handsome.

1391
01:36:50,207 --> 01:36:53,597
Look, with Pedro is one thing.
He's family.

1392
01:36:54,727 --> 01:36:56,001
But no one else.

1393
01:36:56,287 --> 01:36:58,118
You're jealous of Daniel?

1394
01:36:58,287 --> 01:36:59,640
He's totally gay.

1395
01:37:01,007 --> 01:37:03,646
Some people say that
we're all bisexual.

1396
01:37:03,807 --> 01:37:05,160
Oh, yeah?

1397
01:37:08,567 --> 01:37:11,525
-Don't give me that smile.
-What's wrong with it?

1398
01:37:13,207 --> 01:37:14,242
Everything.

1399
01:37:22,047 --> 01:37:25,244
You can feel lonely
in a crowd of people.

1400
01:37:29,167 --> 01:37:31,283
It isn't loneliness
if you choose it.

1401
01:37:31,607 --> 01:37:34,997
Miles don't create distance,
people do.

1402
01:37:36,087 --> 01:37:37,361
That's right.

1403
01:37:37,727 --> 01:37:40,321
You can be happy outside
but sad inside.

1404
01:37:40,807 --> 01:37:42,081
Like clowns.

1405
01:37:42,487 --> 01:37:46,196
Some people are very rich
but actually very poor.

1406
01:37:48,687 --> 01:37:51,360
Money can't buy
the important things in life.

1407
01:37:52,647 --> 01:37:56,526
There are young people over 70
and old people under 1 8.

1408
01:37:58,127 --> 01:38:01,039
We Latinos are more passionate
and confident.

1409
01:38:01,207 --> 01:38:04,836
People in the north are colder.
That's obvious.

1410
01:38:05,047 --> 01:38:09,677
Envy might be our national sport,
but Spanish food is the most varied:

1411
01:38:10,287 --> 01:38:12,960
fabada, paella...

1412
01:38:13,407 --> 01:38:17,002
-Gazpacho.
-And Italian food. Especially pasta.

1413
01:38:18,087 --> 01:38:20,282
-Spaghetti.
-Spaghetti.

1414
01:38:20,447 --> 01:38:22,244
-Ravioli.
-Ravioli.

1415
01:38:22,407 --> 01:38:24,284
-Tortellini.
-Tortellini.

1416
01:38:24,647 --> 01:38:26,524
-Bow-tie.
-Bow-tie.

1417
01:38:50,527 --> 01:38:53,360
It's hot, it's hot.

1418
01:38:53,567 --> 01:38:57,845
-Stop making such a fuss.
-Open up that bottle.

1419
01:38:58,007 --> 01:39:02,000
-We'll toast.
-And make love on the balcony.

1420
01:39:02,407 --> 01:39:05,126
My heart, my heart.

1421
01:39:05,287 --> 01:39:08,120
It's a healthy muscle
but it needs some action.

1422
01:39:08,287 --> 01:39:11,006
Give me peace, give me war,
a sweet high,

1423
01:39:11,167 --> 01:39:13,681
and I'll give you the sky.

1424
01:39:16,927 --> 01:39:19,885
You're sweet as wine,
salty as the sea.

1425
01:39:20,087 --> 01:39:24,956
Open up that deep throat of yours
and set me free.

1426
01:39:49,607 --> 01:39:51,996
It's hot, it's hot.

1427
01:39:52,167 --> 01:39:55,079
She's got a recipe
for feeling right.

1428
01:39:55,327 --> 01:40:00,162
-No hurry, no free smile.
-You must be ready for love.

1429
01:40:01,127 --> 01:40:03,846
Honeymoon, paper moon.

1430
01:40:04,007 --> 01:40:07,761
Full moon, cinnamon skin,
lust-filled nights. Maybe I'm ill,

1431
01:40:07,927 --> 01:40:09,645
maybe I'm fine.

1432
01:40:09,807 --> 01:40:12,799
Take my heart, play a tune.

1433
01:40:15,807 --> 01:40:18,275
She's underage,
I could go to jail.

1434
01:40:18,447 --> 01:40:21,325
Get a hotel,
let's go to dinner.

1435
01:40:21,487 --> 01:40:24,320
Just keep me away from that altar.
