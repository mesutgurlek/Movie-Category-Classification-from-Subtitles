1
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,388
 Gypsy vagabonds are we

2
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,234
 As free as anyone can be

3
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,236
 Wandering on without a care today

4
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,029
 l'm so free! Without a care

5
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,148
 Anywhere that we may roam
is where we make our home

6
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,630
 Be it on the road or sky

7
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,190
 On high! ln the sky!

8
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,236
 Gypsies all

9
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,437
 Never tire

10
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,798
 For we make our home away from home

11
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,792
 We stand, we settle where we roam

12
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,429
 There our gypsy hearts must be content

13
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,512
 With a song, and a fire, and a tent

14
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,434
 With just a song...

15
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,869
 We gypsies like to ride along

16
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,032
 The road

17
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,872
 Along the road

18
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,712
 As we swing

19
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,552
 And we sing

20
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,950
 Our song! 

21
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,711
Good morning, my queen.

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,078
- What news, Salinas?
- Do you realise where we are?

23
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,469
Perfectly well.

24
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,072
So once more, we are encamped
on the domain of the good Count Arnheim.

25
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,833
Count Arnheim! Pah!

26
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,514
What we pick up here
we must pick up quickly.

27
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,433
For he'll never allow us to stay here long.

28
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,272
One of these days, l'll...

29
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,750
 You'll find that we're on the march again

30
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,435
 With our hearts beating time
to a stout fighting song

31
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,671
 We'll do what we can to march along... 

32
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,038
- Arline, look!
- Sweetheart!

33
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,634
How is my little princess this morning?

34
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,110
- Tell me, have you had your lesson?
- Yes.

35
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,113
Count Arnheim, there is a band
of gypsies in the woods below the castle.

36
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,077
Gypsies, eh?

37
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,549
See that they are gone by noon tomorrow.

38
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,509
lf they are caught on my estate, have
them flogged within an inch of their lives.

39
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,071
Tell me, sweetheart,
what did you learn at your lesson?

40
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,391
 That lovely gypsy music

41
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,995
 How gypsy fiddles fly... 

42
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,632
That, my son,
is the true song of the gypsies.

43
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,548
Come and listen
how she sings of life and love.

44
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,757
 ..fade away...

45
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:19,677
 When love calls the heart of a gypsy

46
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:29,316
 lt calls to the heart that is free

47
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,520
 The will of a gypsy

48
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,310
 Caresses her

49
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:47,432
 Only to die with the dawn

50
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,354
 Oh, the road

51
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,319
 That a gypsy must travel

52
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:05,030
 ls planned by the fortunes of time

53
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,678
 So it's one hour of bliss

54
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,228
 And a passionate kiss

55
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,108
 Then farewell to
gypsy romance and melody

56
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,794
 That's what the fiddles are playing

57
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,952
 And sing and be gay as you swing

58
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,713
 For it's one hour of bliss
and a passionate kiss

59
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,349
 And farewell
to gypsy romance and melody

60
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,273
 Gypsy romance!

61
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,354
 Gypsy romance!

62
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,238
 Then farewell to
gypsy romance and melody

63
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,550
 And sing and be gay as you swing

64
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,518
 For it's one hour of bliss
and a passionate kiss

65
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,993
 And farewell...
to gypsy romance and melody!

66
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,469
 Hey! Hey! Hey! 

67
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,758
Ha, ha, ha!

68
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,996
Turn around.

69
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,676
Hello, honey!

70
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,590
Don't honey me, you big bag of suet!

71
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,117
l told you five minutes ago not to talk to me.
And an hour ago! And a week ago!

72
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,351
You told him a year ago too, didn't you?

73
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,318
You shut up
when l'm talking to my husband!

74
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,198
You think you can contradict
everything l say.

75
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,555
Well, you can't and you never will!

76
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,394
You think you're a big man, don't ya?
Don't ya? Don't ya? Don't ya?

77
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,471
Tell her yes.

78
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,869
You keep out of this, woodpecker!

79
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,320
Oh, my love!

80
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,552
Are you going to let her talk to you like that?

81
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,269
Never! A thousand times, never!

82
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,512
Oh, my love! l am so content and happy
when l'm with you.

83
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,909
Just like a nestling dove.

84
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,719
You're so big and strong and brave...

85
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,439
Pardon the intrusion but l don't like you
talking to me like that in front of my friend.

86
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,670
lt's most embarrassing.

87
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,751
Ooh!

88
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,070
What'd she say?

89
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,750
What do you mean, ''talking to me like that''?

90
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,196
l didn't mean anything, honey.
lt was his fault.

91
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,477
Oh... So, it was your idea?

92
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,191
Control yourself! l understand perfectly...

93
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,955
Ooohhh!

94
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,673
l'm not gonna say anything
until l get positive proof

95
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,320
but l saw Devilshoof kissing your wife.

96
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,231
Ridiculous!

97
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,675
Do you believe me or believe what l see?

98
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,799
- Nothing of the kind!
- Go look for yourself.

99
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,391
Well?

100
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,156
There was nothing to it.
They were just having a little innocent fun.

101
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,835
Don't you understand that a man
to be married nowadays

102
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,639
must be broad-minded?

103
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,799
- Did you see him chuck her under the chin?
- Well, what of it?

104
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,510
lf she was my wife, l'd chuck her
under the wagon! l wouldn't stand...

105
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,833
What are you trying to do?
Cause a rift in my matrimonial bonds?

106
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,512
 ..valleys and hills

107
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,831
 Where the sweetest buds grow

108
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,310
 And the waters are real

109
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,756
 And the purest that flow

110
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:18,153
 Come we, come we, come we...

111
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,473
 Come we...

112
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,676
 Here

113
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,070
 From the valleys and hills

114
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,675
 Where the sweetest buds grow

115
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,797
 And the water are real

116
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,031
 And the purest that flow

117
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,510
 Come we, come we

118
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,798
 Come we, come we

119
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,636
 Come we, come we

120
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,030
 Come we

121
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,998
 Come...

122
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,950
 Come...

123
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,838
 Gypsy vagabonds are we

124
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,151
 Free as anyone can be

125
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,198
 lt's the gypsy life for me

126
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,432
 The life that gives us life to lead! 

127
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,628
The moon is very good to us tonight.

128
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,316
The village will be in darkness
and the pickings will be easy.

129
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,838
Splendid! Off with the rogues,
that they may fill their purses

130
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,151
and replenish our coffers!

131
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,394
What l wouldn't give to go with them!

132
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,836
 So black as we work
and believe we'll be

133
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,754
 Finding darkness shortly

134
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,833
 Meanwhile, until the moon goes

135
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,913
 Walk on down, on we go...

136
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,993
 Don't make a sound... 

137
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:14,359
Nine o'clock and all is well!

138
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,796
Nine o'clock and all is well!

139
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,712
Nine o'clock and all is well!

140
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:45,476
Nine o'clock and all is well!

141
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,953
Nine o'clock and all is well!

142
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,719
Nine o'clock and all is well!

143
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,237
Nine o'clock and all is well!

144
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,199
- Could you tell us the time?
- Well, certainly. Hold my bell.

145
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,836
Should be...just exactly...nine o'clo...

146
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,755
Say, what did you ask me the time for?
l've been yelling it all over the village.

147
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,513
lt's nine o'clock and all is well.

148
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,759
Nine o'clock and all is well!

149
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,749
And has this been a happy day for you?

150
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,958
Yes, my father.
Please tell me what is this.

151
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,512
That, my darling, is a medallion that
belonged to your great-great-grandfather

152
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,956
who founded the House of Arnheim.

153
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,429
Please, may l wear the medallion?

154
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,671
Why, of course you can, sweetheart.

155
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,036
But you must be careful not to lose it

156
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,193
because it's very, very precious to me.

157
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,755
Throw up your hands!

158
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,913
- You cursed gypsy!
- You swine!

159
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,355
Hello, strangers!
What are you doing in the village?

160
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,512
We're gypsies
trying to make an honest living.

161
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,355
- Gypsies, eh? Can you tell fortunes?
- He can't but l can.

162
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,750
Good! There's a couple of things
l'd like to know.

163
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,196
And if you could tell me, l'll pay you well.

164
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,471
All right. Your eyes
are the windows of your soul.

165
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,315
And to know all, l must touch your eyes.
Watch closely.

166
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,114
Close your eyes slowly.

167
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,671
Slowly... Slowly... Slowly...

168
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,716
Shut!

169
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,995
Well, what do you see?

170
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,958
l see a long woman and a dark journey.

171
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,349
That's all l see.

172
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,592
Ah, piffle!
''A long woman and a dark journey''!

173
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,434
l wouldn't give you one ducat
for a fortune like that!

174
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,718
What you mean is a long woman
with a tall journey.

175
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,076
Splendid! l shall try that.

176
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,551
Good evening, sir.

177
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,519
We're gypsies earning
an honest living by telling fortunes.

178
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,628
- May we tell yours?
- You may. My motto is ''live and let live''.

179
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,236
Thank you, sir. Now, you see,
your eyes are the windows to your soul.

180
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,118
And to know all, l must touch them.

181
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,270
Now, watch closely!

182
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,993
- Well, what do you see?
- Er, l see... Er...

183
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,992
Ooh!

184
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,229
- You better show me that again.
- Well, it's simple.

185
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,471
You do like this, then you do like that,

186
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,279
then you take his purse like that

187
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,316
and that's the way it's done.

188
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,439
l see. lnstead of doing that, l do this.

189
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:48,072
- Then l take his purse and l...
- lnstead of that, you do this. And...

190
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,272
Why, you little thief! Come on, get along!

191
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,636
Good evening.

192
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,756
Ah. Good evening.

193
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,594
We're gypsies earning an honest living
by telling fortunes.

194
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,319
- May we tell yours?
- l should be delighted.

195
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,871
You know, those of us who are more
fortunate should help those in distress,

196
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,838
- don't you think?
- Yes, madam.

197
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,309
Your eyes are the windows to your soul.

198
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,757
- ln order to know all, l must touch them.
- Oh! What a novelty!

199
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,718
Watch closely! Close your eyes slowly.

200
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,634
Slowly... Slowly...

201
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,678
Slowly... Shut!

202
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,997
What is my fortune?

203
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,198
Once upon a time, there was a little girl
by the name of Red Riding Hood...

204
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,956
who had a very, very sick grandmother.

205
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,077
So Red Riding Hood's mother sent her

206
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,153
with a great big basket
to take to the grandmother.

207
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,118
So the wolf knew it
and ate the grandmother up

208
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,990
and she went to the house
and knocked on the door

209
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,436
and this voice...told her...

210
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,916
Said, ''Come in!'' And you know
what they said? He said that...

211
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,475
Now, you scurvy knave,
give back everything that you've taken.

212
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,676
Come, come.

213
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,157
- This belongs to me!
- Regardless of that.

214
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,196
Now, then, hurry.

215
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,236
- Give the gentleman back his valuables.
- l can explain!

216
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,550
l saw the whole thing with my own eyes.

217
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,313
- You don't realise...
- Quiet! Do as l say!

218
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,555
- There!
- ls that all?

219
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,108
No, sir. That's my watch!

220
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,997
- His watch?
- Quiet!

221
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,389
- And my diamond studded case.
- lt's a...

222
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,596
- Silence!
- And this!

223
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,990
- None of these belongs to...
- Anything else?

224
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,072
- Yes, my rings!
- Come on, hand them over!

225
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,913
- l've never been so embarrassed!
- Anything else?

226
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,276
Oh, yes! l almost forgot my lorgnette!

227
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,511
Oh, and my cane!

228
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,477
His...?

229
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,949
- Come on.
- Just a moment, Officer.

230
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,431
Just a little...offering a gift, here.
A small stipend.

231
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,193
- Thank you!
- One more little detail.

232
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,999
- My pistol. Can't do without that!
- Pardon me.

233
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,392
- lt's quite all right.
- My solicitor shall hear of this!

234
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,029
Well, Stanley, a very profitable evening!

235
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,839
- A little refreshment?
- That's a good idea.

236
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,876
Come, Stanley.

237
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,595
- Good night... Oh!
- Good night.

238
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,319
l-l beg your pardon.

239
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,630
Why don't you be careful?

240
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,676
Oh, well, that's different!

241
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,750
Thank you, Stanley.

242
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,435
- Yes, sir?
- Two tankards of your rarest vintage.

243
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,273
- And put a wallop in it.
- Yes, sir.

244
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,749
Come, come, my man! Hurry!

245
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,756
Look!

246
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,355
lt's a good thing we got his cane.

247
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,874
Come on, hurry up, hurry up!

248
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,637
- Two tankards of our rarest vintage.
- Right away!

249
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,956
Thank you.

250
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,996
Give it to me.

251
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,596
Give me all of it!

252
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,717
Why should l? lt's as much yours as mine.

253
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,519
All right, l'll play you for it.

254
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,273
- What?
- l'll play you fingers.

255
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,999
- What's ''fingers''?
- lt's very simple.

256
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,471
You put your fist up like that.
Then you put out some fingers.

257
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:42,510
lf you put out the same amount
of fingers that l do, you win.

258
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,230
And if you don't put out
the same amount of fingers, you lose.

259
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,154
- All right.
- May the best man win.

260
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,272
Ready?

261
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,272
Oh, no! l'll tell you what we'll do.

262
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,273
- We'll play this time ''winner take all''.
- All right.

263
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,110
A gentlemen's agreement.

264
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,953
Ready?

265
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,076
Aha!

266
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,631
Aha!

267
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,553
Oh-ho...

268
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,391
Count Arnheim orders you and your cursed
gypsies to be on your way by noon.

269
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,430
Tell Count Arnheim the cursed gypsies'll
be away from here long before that! Pah!

270
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,031
Ahem!

271
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,990
Curse you, Count Arnheim!

272
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,311
For every whip stroke
you have bestowed upon my beloved,

273
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,391
may you suffer a year of woe.

274
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,759
Look!

275
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,716
Count Arnheim's only child!

276
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,916
Only child...?

277
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,474
- Give me a part of that banana.
- Huh?

278
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,790
Give me a part of the banana.

279
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,112
Arline!

280
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,958
Arline?

281
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,396
Arline!

282
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,036
Oop! Oh! Oh! Oh!

283
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,839
There, run and play.

284
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,310
Hmm. Nobody will ever recognise her now.

285
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,154
Good. But how will you account
for her to your husband?

286
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,630
Have no fear.
He'll believe anything l tell him.

287
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,995
He must never know who she really is.

288
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,039
lf he suspected anything,
he and that nitwit henchman of his

289
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,315
would tell it to the whole world!

290
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,029
Don't worry, my precious. l can handle them.

291
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,790
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

292
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,440
Hurry up and get that fire going!

293
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,272
All right, dear.

294
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,631
- Hello!
- Hello.

295
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,471
- Where do you live?
- ln there.

296
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,951
lsn't it that nice?

297
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,351
Hey!

298
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,192
What?

299
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,239
- Er... Whose kid is that?
- lt's none of your business.

300
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,356
What do you mean?

301
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,113
l demand to know who she is.

302
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,351
Well, if you must know, she's yours.

303
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,952
Mine?

304
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,876
Why didn't you tell me before?

305
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,589
Because l didn't want her
to know who her father was

306
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,717
till she was old enough to stand the shock.

307
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,079
Come here, dear.

308
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,116
Come up.

309
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,998
That is your father.

310
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,640
Stanley...congratulate me!

311
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,314
- What for?
- l have just become a father.

312
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,516
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

313
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,070
- When did this happen?
- Just a minute ago.

314
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,118
Well, blow me down with an anchovy!

315
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,274
- Darling, meet your uncle Stanley.
- How do you do, Uncle Stanley?

316
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,191
l'm pleased to meet you.

317
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:22,274
Well, Oliver, l hope you grow up to be
as good a mother as your father.

318
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,033
- Thank you, Stanley.
- Have a cigar.

319
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,111
Thank you again.

320
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,634
Have a cigar?

321
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,996
- What's this for?
- Oliver's just had a baby.

322
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,548
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

323
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,910
Come, Stanley, we will spread
the glad tidings to the world!

324
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:59,119
- My love, what has happened?
- l'm leaving this camp forever.

325
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,112
- You mean...?
- l shall never see you again.

326
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,192
- But where will you go?
- What does it matter?

327
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,398
Since l was a boy,
l've had no other roof but the stars.

328
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,278
l've been free to come and free to go.

329
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,911
- And l give my love to whom l fancy.
- But what will happen to me?

330
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,633
 Well, other lips

331
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,952
 And other hearts

332
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:33,515
 Their tales of love shall tell

333
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:41,792
 ln language which itself imparts

334
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:49,355
 Just how they feel so well

335
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:56,278
 There may, perhaps, in such a scene

336
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:03,869
 Some recollection be

337
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:12,117
 Of days that have more happy been

338
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:19,356
 And you'll remember me

339
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,273
 That you'll remember

340
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:31,393
 You'll remember

341
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,596
 Me 

342
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:46,315
Oh, Devilshoof, l couldn't possibly go on
here without you! Take me with you!

343
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,197
That is impossible!

344
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:53,559
l have nothing.
My horse, the clothes l stand in...

345
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,555
lf we only had a little money.

346
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,756
Some jewels, perhaps...

347
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,596
Then, it would be different.

348
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,719
- You mean you would take me with you?
- Gladly, my love.

349
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,836
Him!

350
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,354
He shall be the one to get me everything!
Everything!

351
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,273
Wait and see, my Devilshoof!

352
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,272
Hello, Stanley, dear!

353
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,316
What are you doing?

354
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,188
- l'm making myself a malted milk.
- Oh!

355
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,876
How long does it take?

356
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,270
- About 15 minutes to a quarter of an hour.
- Really?

357
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,592
And l can do it much faster
if l'm not interrupted.

358
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,395
Oh! That's all right, Stanley dear!

359
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,233
You know, accidents will happen.

360
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,871
- You're not mad at me?
- Why, certainly not!

361
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,190
Why should l get mad at you? You know,
l like you a lot better than l used to.

362
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,236
Can't you tell?

363
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:44,549
Stanley, darling, from now on,
everything is going to be different.

364
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,235
l'm going to be very, very nice to you.

365
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,638
- Are you going to be nice to Oliver too?
- l'm going to be more than nice to Oliver.

366
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,280
l'm planning a big surprise for him.

367
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:02,150
And if you will help me,
l know it would please him very much.

368
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,391
- What do l have to do?
- Shh. Listen...

369
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,675
Now, listen. You go into the wagon
and get my clothes

370
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,197
and all the money and jewels that Oliver has
and hand them to me.

371
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,068
- What do you want them for?
- Ah, that's the big surprise.

372
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,118
- Do you think you can do it?
- Why, that's easy.

373
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,751
Oh, but be careful that he doesn't see
or know what you are doing.

374
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:37,914
Don't worry about me.
l could gyp that gypsy anytime!

375
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,434
He's so dumb, he's thicker than mud.

376
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,270
Oh, Stanley, you're a darling!

377
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,032
- He's fast asleep.
- How do you know?

378
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,554
He's got his mouth open.

379
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,471
Where does he keep his money bag?

380
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,755
Usually under his pillow!

381
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,555
- Just what are you looking for?
- Have you got a match?

382
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,790
Have l got a...? Get outta there!

383
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,033
So you were looking for a match, huh?

384
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:08,114
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
After all l've done for you!

385
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,158
l took you out of the gutter
and gave you a career.

386
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:16,394
Made a first-class pickpocket out of you.
And this is your gratitude!

387
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,473
lt hurts, Stanley. l tell you, it hurts.

388
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,869
We were only trying to surprise you!

389
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,235
You surprised me, all right.

390
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,596
But thank Heaven l saved you from yourself.

391
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:33,231
l not only hid my valuables
but l hid yours as well.

392
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,993
And l hid them right here!

393
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,438
- Well, what news?
- The men we sent out have returned.

394
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,195
l regret to report
the search has proved futile.

395
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,840
Then there is nothing more you can do.

396
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,393
Now...

397
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,392
What are we going to use for a nightie?

398
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,716
Hold your arm out.

399
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,036
That's it.

400
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,112
Now, we'll just slip this right over your head.

401
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,516
Put your hands in there.

402
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,239
That's it. Just a minute, now.

403
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,430
Down like that. Then we'll button this up
to protect your little neck.

404
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,476
So you won't get cold.

405
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,358
That's it. Now, let's see how that looks.

406
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,476
Oh! Ha ha!

407
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,073
Come on!

408
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,518
- Come in!

409
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:18,038

 La, la la la la la la, la-la-la

410
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,476
 La, la la la la la... 

411
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,152
Hello, Ollie.

412
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,640
Do you know that you've got a nice voice?

413
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,951
l had a much nicer voice
till l ran a nail through it...

414
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,157
You ran a nail through it!

415
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,356
Let me hear you sing that again.

416
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,079
 Da, da, daaaa!

417
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,833
 Da, da, daaaa!

418
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,152
 Da da da da da da da...!

419
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,072
- Now l've torn it.
- Say good night to Uncle Stanley.

420
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,879
- Good night, Uncle Stanley.
- Good night.

421
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,157
Er... What's her name?

422
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,152
That's right, we haven't got a name for her.

423
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,549
What can we call her?

424
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,756
Why don't you call me Arline?

425
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,718
There's a good idea,
why don't we call her Arline?

426
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,839
lf l don't want to,
why should l call her Arline?

427
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,593
Because that's my name.

428
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,513
ls that so? Well, that's a pretty name.

429
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,114
- lsn't that funny?
- Let's go to bed.

430
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,475
Not before l say my prayers.

431
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,312
All right.

432
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:38,952
Now l lay me down to sleep,
l pray the Lord my soul to keep.

433
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,272
lf... lf... lf...

434
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,237
What's next?

435
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,878
lf at first you don't succeed, try, try...

436
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,518
try again.

437
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:03,038
lf at first you don't succeed,
try, try, try again.

438
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,839
- Amen.
- That's right. That's fine.

439
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,388
''Try, try again''! Oh!

440
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,431
Gonna give me a big kiss? That's the way!

441
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,715
We get right down in there.

442
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,998
We put the cover right around there.
Now, good night!

443
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,389
{Deep voice}
 La, la la la la la la, la la la...

444
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,519
 La, la la la la la la, la la la...

445
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,229
 La, la la la la la la, la la

446
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,197
 La la la, la la la,

447
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,236
 La laaaa! 

448
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,797
 Da, da, daaaaa, da, da...! 

449
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,072
Shh!

450
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,958
Yoo-hoo!

451
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,472
Yoo-hoo!

452
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,234
- Good morning, Arline, dear!
- Get up, lazybones!

453
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,073
- Breakfast is ready!
- We're coming.

454
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:07,039
- You should've been up hours ago!
- Well, l didn't know...

455
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,109
- Morning, Arline.
- Morning, Uncle Stanley.

456
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,192
- Good morning, dear.
- Good morning, Daddy dear.

457
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,150
How did you sleep, Daddy dear?

458
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,550
l slept like a top.
And how did you sleep, Stanley?

459
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,870
l slept like a top, too.

460
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,311
- How did you sleep, dear?
- Marvellously, Daddy.

461
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,630
l had such a wonderful dream.

462
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,759
There were castles and palaces and l...

463
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,115
l was a princess.

464
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,509
A princess?

465
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,798
 l dreamt l dwelled

466
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,759
 ln a marble hall

467
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:57,951
 With vassals and serfs at my side

468
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,829
 And of all who assembled

469
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:07,038
 Within those walls

470
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:13,798
 That l was the hope and the pride

471
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,198
 l had riches

472
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,398
 All too great to count

473
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:30,831
 And a high ancestral name

474
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:37,314
 But l also dreamt

475
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,552
 Which pleased me most

476
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:46,714
 That you loved me still the same

477
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,430
 That you loved me, you loved me

478
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,671
 Still the same

479
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,797
 That you loved me

480
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,952
 You loved me

481
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,670
 Still

482
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,117
 The same

483
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:31,275
 l dreamt that suitors sought my hand

484
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:38,516
 That knights upon bended knee

485
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,750
 And with vows

486
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:47,995
 No maiden heart could withstand

487
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:54,872
 They pledged their faith to me

488
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:03,992
 And l dreamt that one of that noble host

489
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:12,078
 Came forth my hand to claim

490
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:18,793
 But l also dreamt

491
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,078
 Which charmed me most

492
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:28,188
 That you loved me still the same

493
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,479
 That you loved me, you loved me

494
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,552
 Still the same

495
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,871
 That you loved me

496
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,270
 You loved me

497
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:49,515
 Still

498
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:54,993
 The

499
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:59,995
 Same 

500
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,078
l have never heard
of such a beautiful dream.

501
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:15,073
- Sit down and have your breakfast.
- l've had mine hours ago.

502
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,230
Wasn't that lovely?

503
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,920
Of all the greedy things! What did you
want to eat all the breakfast for?

504
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,468
- l didn't want it to go cold.
- Didn't want...!

505
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:46,348
l didn't know how long
she was going to dream and....

506
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,079
Daddy, l'm going to the village.

507
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,513
All right.

508
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:54,479
- Goodbye.
- Arline! Haven't you forgotten something?

509
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,312
What?

510
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:02,150
- Of course. Goodbye, Daddy dear.
- Goodbye, sweetheart.

511
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,754
You too, Uncle Stan.

512
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,398
Goodbye.

513
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,074
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

514
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,951
Get some hot water
and help me clean these dishes.

515
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,989
- Haven't you forgotten something?
- Huh?

516
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,514
Haven't you forgotten something?

517
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,556
Get me the dish pan!

518
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,635
You clean up the wagon, l'll do this!

519
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,992
- Ollie...
- What?

520
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,038
- What about this wine?
- What about it?

521
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,395
lt's fuzzling. Look.

522
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,878
So it is. lt needs bottling.
You get some bottles and bottle it.

523
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:16,192
- Where are the bottles?
- You'll find some under the wagon.

524
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,712
- Where are you going?
- l'm going to take my zipper lessons.

525
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,678
- Oh.
- l won't be back until late this afternoon.

526
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:46,036
While l'm gone,
please don't get into any mischief.

527
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,758
Uh-uh.

528
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,400
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

529
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:06,629
 The heart bowed down by weight of woe

530
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:15,594
 To weakest hope will cling

531
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:24,870
 Will seize the happy face of a child

532
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:32,310
 And by its charm is beguiled

533
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,518
 Oh, destiny's tide

534
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:44,598
 Has long since taken her from my side

535
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:53,272
 The dream as it flows tenderly by

536
00:58:54,800 --> 00:59:03,913
 May bring a tear to the eye

537
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:14,394
 But memory is the only friend

538
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:23,073
 That grief can call its own

539
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:29,393
 That grief can call

540
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:35,191
 lts own

541
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:43,993
 That grief

542
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,834
 Can call

543
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:52,798
 lts own 

544
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,079
Well! What are you doing here?

545
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:09,397
- You're a thieving gypsy!
- Let me go!

546
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,835
Let me go! Let me go!

547
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,993
- Throw her in the dungeon! Away with her!
- l'm not a thief, sir!

548
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,076
l'll show you what we do
with thieving gypsies here.

549
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,108
- Enter.

550
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:32,709
l have captured a gypsy in the grounds
whom l have thrown in the dungeon.

551
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:37,237
Let him remain there
until l find time to witness the lashing.

552
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:41,359
- But, Your Highness, it is a woman.
- Nevertheless, she shall be lashed.

553
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,955
Stan! Stan!

554
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,235
Stan! Stan!

555
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,754
Stan! Arline's in terrible danger!

556
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:55,072
She's been captured and thrown
in the dungeon! We gotta rescue her!

557
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,475
- You're guzzled!
- Oh...

558
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,757
Nothing of the kind. l...

559
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,638
You would do this
just when l need you most!

560
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,396
Pull yourself together. We've got to go
and help her. Go on, get out!

561
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,835
 ..when the call of the bugle we hear

562
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,595
 And once we have started,
we never get through

563
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,070
 Till we turn to present the platoon

564
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,675
 At the drop of a hat
from our master and lord

565
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:50,230
 We are off to defend him with the sword

566
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:53,915
 With a song on our lips
as we tramp, tramp along...

567
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,950
- Shh! Quiet!

568
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:16,470
lf they catch us here, it'll cost us our lives!

569
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,996
- Psst! Arline!

570
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,197
- What are you doing here?
- We'll get you out.

571
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:49,636
- Please be careful!
- Uncle Stanley's going to help

572
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:52,075
and we'll have you out in a jiffy.

573
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,913
Good!

574
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,715
Would you keep quiet?!

575
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,274
Ooh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

576
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,160
Get out of the light. l can't see!

577
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,836
That's better.

578
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,719
Why don't you try the door?

579
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:49,190
That's a good idea.
lt won't be long now, dear.

580
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,840
- Shh!

581
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,476
- Shh!

582
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:18,390
That's wonderful!
Where'd you get the keys?

583
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,391
Ohh!

584
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,518
Oh, please!

585
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:33,149
- You cursed gypsy!
- Please!

586
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,996
Now, me proud and hearty beauty,
your time has come!

587
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,640
Come on!

588
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:54,868
So! You tried to make me look
a bigger fool than l am, huh?

589
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,199
Oh! My good eye!

590
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,555
Seize him! Seize him!

591
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,432
Stan! Stan!

592
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,875
Stan, come over here!

593
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,638
Stan! Stan!

594
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:34,276
Stan! Stan, get us out of here!

595
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,238
Surround the castle! They must be taken!

596
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:51,234
Take those two raggamuffians
to the torture chamber!

597
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:55,598
- No, they didn't do anything...!
- And as for you, my fair lady,

598
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,636
you come with me!

599
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,594
- l didn't do anything!
- You will be lashed!

600
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,830
Give me this!

601
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,478
Take it away!

602
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,677
Tie her to the post!
Prepare her for the lashing!

603
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,194
l haven't done anything! Let me go!

604
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,635
You're a gypsy! Lash her!

605
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,711
Stop!

606
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:25,036
Arline! My child!

607
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,476
Get in there!

608
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,038
Oh!

609
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,073
Get...! Oh! Hey! Ohh!

610
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:10,875
Stanley, do something
to help me! Stanley!

611
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,476
Those are the people who befriended me
and loved me. You must save them!

612
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,710
Release the prisoners!

613
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,753
D'oh! Oh!

614
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,753
