1
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:28,162
<i>Sailing along</i>

2
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:33,832
<i>With the moon</i>

3
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:38,804
<i>In our eyes</i>

4
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:44,176
<i>Sailing on</i>

5
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:46,975
<i>To a paradise</i>

6
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:54,614
<i>On an island with you</i>

7
00:02:58,494 --> 00:03:05,832
<i>See how the sea</i>

8
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,068
<i>Throws a kiss</i>

9
00:03:12,842 --> 00:03:16,243
<i>To the shore</i>

10
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:20,847
<i>How I long</i>

11
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:25,147
<i>To belong</i>

12
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:32,487
<i>In your arms ever more</i>

13
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:43,362
<i>On an island with you</i>

14
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:50,144
<i>On an island</i>

15
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:56,912
<i>With you</i>

16
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:21,074
- Like it?
- Love it.

17
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,926
- Like it?
- Love it.

18
00:04:42,332 --> 00:04:44,994
Get away from him, <i>malo.</i>

19
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:46,965
I will not get away from him.

20
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,930
Oh, yes, you will. He belongs to me.

21
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:53,037
If he belongs to you,
let's see you take him away from me.

22
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,643
I don't have to take him away from you.

23
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:58,303
I already have.

24
00:05:02,485 --> 00:05:06,148
- I'm sorry, I forgot my next line.
- All right. Cut it.

25
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:08,085
- Print the last two takes, Jane.
- Okay.

26
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:10,691
I'm sorry, George.
I just couldn't seem to remember.

27
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,760
Don't worry, Roz. We'll pick it up later.

28
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:16,126
You were supposed to say that
when you love a man, you fight for him.

29
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:19,427
I shouldn't like to have you
forget that line. Ever.

30
00:05:19,602 --> 00:05:23,003
You know I wouldn't forget, Rick. Ever.

31
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:30,036
Where's Buckley?

32
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:32,738
Probably on the phone,
trying to explain to Mr. Fitz...

33
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:36,316
...why we only got three scenes yesterday
instead of six.

34
00:05:37,286 --> 00:05:39,220
Yes, Mr. Fitz.

35
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:41,050
I know, Mr. Fitz.

36
00:05:41,224 --> 00:05:43,317
But we couldn't get
any more scenes yesterday.

37
00:05:43,493 --> 00:05:45,461
We ran out of sun.

38
00:05:46,295 --> 00:05:49,162
Maybe it was shining in Hollywood,
but it wasn't shining here.

39
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:52,495
It came out for a little while,
then disappeared.

40
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:55,136
But, Mr. Fitz,
I'm only the assistant director.

41
00:05:55,304 --> 00:05:58,535
What do you want me to do,
tell it to go out and come in again?

42
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,506
All right, Mr. Fitz, I'll try.

43
00:06:02,011 --> 00:06:04,411
But we couldn't get any more scenes.

44
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:06,705
All right, Mr. Fitz.

45
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:08,908
Goodbye, Mr. Fitz.

46
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:12,111
How do you like that? Now I'm responsible
for the sun going down.

47
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,653
Yes, sir.

48
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,954
Get me Lieutenant Kingslee.

49
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,991
Lieutenant Kingslee's
in the barbershop.

50
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:21,153
Barbershop? That's ridiculous.

51
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,820
They got barbers in the Navy.

52
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:25,160
He'd better not put that
on his expense account.

53
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:27,461
Oh, Mr. Buckley, we're ready.

54
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,435
Mrs. Peabody, we don't shoot
the wedding scene for two weeks.

55
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:31,937
Go ahead, Penelope.

56
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:36,545
<i>Something old, something new</i>
<i>Something borrowed, something blue.</i>

57
00:06:36,712 --> 00:06:38,509
<i>That's what every bride should do.</i>

58
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:42,946
Too British.
She's supposed to be an American kid.

59
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:51,190
But, Grandmother,
how can one possibly be too British?

60
00:06:58,434 --> 00:07:01,403
Lieutenant. Lieutenant, we're waiting.

61
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,641
Looks like you're in dry dock for repairs.

62
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:09,335
Oh, just getting shipshape. Gotta uphold
the honor of the Navy, you know.

63
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,571
That's not the Navy I know.

64
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:14,841
- Besides, you're holding up production.
- Oh, how is Miss Rennolds?

65
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,212
- Fine, fine.
- Is she expecting me?

66
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:22,449
Lieutenant, Miss Rennolds is expecting
a technical advisor, not a leading man.

67
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:25,222
Well, how is she feeling?

68
00:07:25,394 --> 00:07:28,659
Fine. Hey, wait a minute,
I just answered that.

69
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:32,597
Listen, admiral, you're here to check
on uniforms, not the leading lady.

70
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:35,703
That's right, uniforms.
But she is beautiful, isn't she?

71
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:39,103
Sure, she's beautiful,
so stop wasting time and come on.

72
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:41,266
Wait a minute.
Have you got some change?

73
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:44,504
- Sure.
- Take care of them, will you, for me?

74
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,205
Use a little discretion, son.

75
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:03,398
If you must go, Bill,
please take me with you.

76
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,693
Sorry, Tanya, not this time.

77
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:07,335
Maybe when I come back.

78
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:09,528
All right, cut it.

79
00:08:09,805 --> 00:08:13,366
- Where's Buckley? Isn't he back yet?
- I'm right behind you, George.

80
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:16,671
And here's your Navy. Lieutenant Kingslee,
Mr. Blaine, our director.

81
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:18,143
How do you do?

82
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:21,408
- Well, how do you do, lieutenant?
- How do you do, sir?

83
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,552
- This is Jane.
- Hello.

84
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:26,916
- Eddie. Martha.
- Hello.

85
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,557
- This is Yvonne.
- Hello.

86
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,424
Miss Rennolds, Mr. Montez.
Lieutenant Kingslee.

87
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,857
How do you do, lieutenant?

88
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,156
Hello, Miss Rennolds.

89
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:37,629
- I thought I'd never get here.
- Hello, lieutenant.

90
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,360
- Oh, you haven't changed a bit.
- Haven't I?

91
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:44,131
- It seems like only yesterday.
- Yesterday?

92
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,733
Yes, yes, of course.

93
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:48,740
- You don't know how much...
- Lieutenant.

94
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:50,310
Never mind the tête-à-tête.

95
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:52,913
Just tell us if the ribbons are right.

96
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:55,175
The ribbons, lieutenant, are over here.

97
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:56,340
Over here.

98
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:59,581
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

99
00:09:00,423 --> 00:09:02,220
They're authentic, but upside down.

100
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:04,382
- Do you mind if I fix them?
- No, not at all.

101
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,495
I am grateful you're here
to see that everything is authentic.

102
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:09,597
So am I, Mr. Montez.

103
00:09:09,765 --> 00:09:12,734
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

104
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,633
An American Naval lieutenant
with that accent?

105
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,209
So he was born in South America
and joined the Navy.

106
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:24,005
Don't worry about it.

107
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,013
- What does Miss Rennolds think?
- She picked him.

108
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:29,276
Places, everybody.

109
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:32,017
All right, Martha, she's pretty enough.

110
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:34,622
I'll let you know when I'm ready.

111
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:41,619
- I'm ready.
- Places.

112
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:52,464
Are you ready, boss?

113
00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:55,110
- Roll them.
- Action, please.

114
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,335
I love you, Bill.

115
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,037
I'll always love you.

116
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:01,513
You can't leave me. I won't let you.

117
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,447
You're beautiful, Tanya.

118
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:07,817
Beautiful and dangerous,
which makes it all the harder to leave.

119
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,457
Then take me with you.

120
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:13,026
No, Tanya.
Maybe sometime in the future.

121
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,925
But for the present,
I'm going to have to forget you.

122
00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:17,793
- Oh, no.
- Cut it.

123
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:20,091
Something wrong, lieutenant?

124
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:22,294
- Wrong? I'm sorry, sir...
- Lieutenant, please.

125
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:25,599
You're here to worry about ribbons,
uniforms, the plane, that's all.

126
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:29,267
Just a minute. If something's wrong
with the scene, I wanna know what it is.

127
00:10:29,445 --> 00:10:31,470
What's bothering you, lieutenant?

128
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,244
Well, sir, so long as you asked me.

129
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:36,578
She's a beautiful girl...

130
00:10:36,752 --> 00:10:40,119
...and, well, if she were mine,
I'd kiss her and take her with me.

131
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:43,053
- Oh, you would?
- Yes, sir.

132
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,193
Tell you what you do,
you play this scene.

133
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:47,420
After all, Rick's playing a Navy pilot.

134
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:49,564
We'd like to be authentic.

135
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,257
- Do you mind, Roz?
- Of course not. Come on, lieutenant.

136
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,736
Stand right over here, lieutenant.
Jane, come here.

137
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,810
Give him your line, Roz.

138
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:05,644
I love you, Bill. I'll always love you.

139
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:08,306
Give the lieutenant his line, Jane.

140
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:10,348
"You're beautiful, Tanya.

141
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:13,955
Beautiful and dangerous,
which makes it all the harder to leave."

142
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,916
You're beautiful, Tanya.

143
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,653
Beautiful and dangerous,
which makes it all the harder to leave.

144
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:21,490
Well, then, take me with you.

145
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:24,424
"No, Tanya.
Maybe sometime in the future."

146
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,465
You're the most wonderful girl
in the world.

147
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:29,729
I've never stopped thinking about you
from the first time we met.

148
00:11:29,905 --> 00:11:34,569
I've wondered if you felt the same way.
Hoped that you did.

149
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:43,215
All right, lieutenant, that'll do.

150
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,618
Thanks for showing us
how it's done in the Navy.

151
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,385
Oh, you're welcome, sir.

152
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:54,654
I'd be glad to do it the rest of my life.

153
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,697
He must have been at sea a long time.

154
00:11:57,867 --> 00:12:00,893
All right, boys and girls,
let's try another take.

155
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,971
Well, come on, Buckley.
What are we waiting for?

156
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:06,901
Martha, any time. Any time.

157
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,768
I'll let you know.

158
00:12:08,944 --> 00:12:12,402
There's a million lieutenants in the Navy,
and I had to pick you.

159
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:14,674
You don't know how grateful I am, sir.

160
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,215
You've won yourself a friend.

161
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:19,081
That ought to teach me not to gamble.

162
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:41,035
<i>Don't be afraid of my little Chihuahua</i>

163
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,043
<i>He's only a little wow-wow-wa</i>

164
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:46,647
<i>He never will fight</i>
<i>And he never will bite</i>

165
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:49,785
<i>Till you give him tequila and</i> agua

166
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:55,952
<i>He's not as long as your shoe or huarache</i>

167
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,992
<i>But one look from him and he's gotcha</i>

168
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:01,891
<i>And I'll feel morose</i>
<i>When he tells me adiós</i>

169
00:13:02,064 --> 00:13:05,591
<i>On the day that he meets his muchacha</i>

170
00:13:06,235 --> 00:13:09,136
<i>Why, he's smarter than a rabbit</i>

171
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:12,399
<i>And wiser than an old owl</i>

172
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,534
<i>And when he's not held close</i>
<i>In someone's arms, he'll howl</i>

173
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:21,373
<i>Though he's as strong as a big caballero</i>

174
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,212
<i>And wilder than any bolero</i>

175
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,355
<i>He's scared of the dark</i>
<i>And I know that he'll bark</i>

176
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:30,617
<i>At the drop of your newest sombrero</i>

177
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:02,552
<i>He's not as long as your shoe or huarache</i>

178
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:05,285
<i>One look from him and he's gotcha</i>

179
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:09,295
<i>Oh, I'll feel morose</i>
<i>When he tells me adiós</i>

180
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:14,164
<i>Why, that's the dog song</i>

181
00:14:21,176 --> 00:14:23,110
Thank you. Thank you very much.

182
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,238
Tonight we have with us
some of Hollywood's finest personalities.

183
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,351
They're here making the motion picture
<i>On an Island with You.</i>

184
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:33,682
First, I want you to meet
that very lovely lady of the screen...

185
00:14:33,856 --> 00:14:36,586
...Miss Rosalind Rennolds.

186
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:43,026
And sitting close to her,
and I don't blame him...

187
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:49,262
...is her costar and soon-to-be-husband,
Señor Don Ricardo Montez.

188
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:58,075
And sitting at the same table
is a man who works behind the scenes.

189
00:14:58,247 --> 00:15:01,114
The guiding handle of the picture.

190
00:15:01,283 --> 00:15:04,616
He's a man that works very hard,
but we never see him.

191
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:10,020
One of our finest directors,
Mr. George Blaine.

192
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:19,023
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
we invite you to dance.

193
00:15:22,204 --> 00:15:25,037
Don't you worry, Yvonne,
he didn't introduce me either.

194
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:26,936
Would you like your entrée now?

195
00:15:27,109 --> 00:15:31,307
If it comes with the dinner,
just bring it on, à la carte.

196
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:36,448
Excuse me.

197
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,318
- Hello, Mr. Buckley.
- I know what you're up to. It's no good.

198
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,323
Look, you joined the Navy to see the world,
not Miss Rennolds.

199
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:45,983
I just wanna ask for a dance.

200
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:51,299
She's got someone to dance with.

201
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:55,528
Now, come on, before you manugle around
and get us both into trouble.

202
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,400
This is a nice, cozy table for two.

203
00:15:58,574 --> 00:16:00,599
You and me.

204
00:16:05,614 --> 00:16:08,742
If you wanna dance with someone,
why don't you ask Yvonne?

205
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:10,782
Because I wanna dance
with Miss Rennolds.

206
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:13,922
Why not Yvonne?
She's a wonderful terpsichorean.

207
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:17,354
And besides, she's a wonderful dancer.

208
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,426
You know what?

209
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:22,996
I think she's kind of lonesome.

210
00:16:29,538 --> 00:16:31,005
Hello.

211
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:32,697
Hello.

212
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:36,473
They're very much in love, aren't they?

213
00:16:36,645 --> 00:16:38,044
Yes, I'm sure they are.

214
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:47,153
They're gonna be married soon.
Very soon.

215
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:50,550
He's very lucky to have someone
as wonderful as Roz.

216
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:52,455
They're both very lucky.

217
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:55,893
You know, the word "lucky"
is misused so often, Yvonne.

218
00:16:56,065 --> 00:17:00,968
You see, we waste a lot of life
wanting something that somebody else has.

219
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:03,400
Life isn't quite that long.

220
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:04,800
Yes.

221
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:07,635
That's what my grandmother
used to tell me.

222
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:14,038
- Oh, that was wonderful, Rick.
- Thank you.

223
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,310
- Would you like to dance, Yvonne?
- Do you mind, Roz?

224
00:17:19,488 --> 00:17:21,854
- Of course not.
- I'd love to.

225
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,497
You got everything straight?

226
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:35,068
You're gonna forget Roz
and concentrate on Yvonne.

227
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:36,864
Oh, waiter.

228
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,506
Bring us two double maraschino specials.

229
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:43,907
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna dance with Miss Rennolds.

230
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:45,976
Oh, son.

231
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:51,947
Never mind. Make it one bromo.

232
00:17:52,221 --> 00:17:54,314
- Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
- Hello, lieutenant.

233
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,357
- Miss Rennolds, may I have this dance?
- No, thank you.

234
00:17:57,526 --> 00:17:59,016
No?

235
00:17:59,294 --> 00:18:03,731
- Well, you do dance, don't you?
- Well, of course I dance, but not tonight.

236
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:07,733
It'd mean a great deal to me,
and I've waited such a long time.

237
00:18:07,903 --> 00:18:10,303
I'm afraid you're gonna have to wait
a little longer.

238
00:18:10,472 --> 00:18:11,700
Good night, lieutenant.

239
00:18:11,874 --> 00:18:14,866
Miss Rennolds, the music's wonderful
and everybody's dancing...

240
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:20,344
Look, lieutenant,
I just don't care to dance.

241
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,541
Maybe some other time, huh?

242
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:25,152
Lady said good night, lieutenant.

243
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,987
Thank you, Miss Rennolds.
Maybe some other time.

244
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:33,552
Why didn't you dance with him, Roz?

245
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:36,630
I don't know. After what happened
this afternoon on the set...

246
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,960
...I thought it was better
not to encourage him.

247
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:41,398
- Was I rude?
- Let's just say you were firm.

248
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,231
You know, he does look familiar to me.

249
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:49,775
I wish I could remember
where I've seen him before.

250
00:18:57,653 --> 00:18:59,848
Rick's a wonderful dancer, isn't he?

251
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:02,086
Yes, he is.

252
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,316
Don't feel so bad, kid.
You made a mistake.

253
00:21:12,487 --> 00:21:15,718
We all have a foolish five minutes
when we make mistakes.

254
00:21:15,891 --> 00:21:17,654
I haven't made any mistakes.

255
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:19,293
Just give me a little time.

256
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:21,019
Time for what?

257
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,857
I'll dance with her yet.

258
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,430
Lieutenant, look...

259
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:27,659
...if it'll make you happy,
I'll dance with you.

260
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:33,207
What's the matter, lose a customer?

261
00:21:33,842 --> 00:21:37,107
No. Mr. Cugat lost his little dog, Chita.

262
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,769
She always runs away.

263
00:21:38,947 --> 00:21:42,644
You mean to say he's upset
over losing that cockroach?

264
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,247
Lieutenant, did you just kick me?

265
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:51,119
Of course not.

266
00:21:52,494 --> 00:21:54,428
Now, wait a minute.

267
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:02,862
You'd better get back to Mr. Cugat.

268
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,166
You know, you could be mistaken
for an hors d'oeuvre.

269
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:15,510
Oh, there you are.

270
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:18,812
You shouldn't let this mouse
run around the floor frightening women.

271
00:22:18,987 --> 00:22:20,579
A mouse? You call my Chita mouse?

272
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:27,357
I want you to know that my Chita
is a full-blooded, pedigreed canine...

273
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:29,156
...fathered by Canary Fluff.

274
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:30,628
Fathered by Canary Fluff?

275
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,994
And you're mad at me
for calling it names?

276
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:36,001
I think you should apologize.
You hurt my feelings.

277
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,795
I hurt your feelings?

278
00:22:37,973 --> 00:22:39,099
What about mine?

279
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,243
I was sitting at the table too
when you made those introductions.

280
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,372
Well, when you are a famous man,
I'll introduce you too.

281
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,181
I admit, I'm nobody now...

282
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,615
...but years ago, the name of Buckley
meant something in show business.

283
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,654
Used to be a trio:
Clayton, Jackson and Buckley.

284
00:22:54,823 --> 00:22:56,222
Ask any booking agent.

285
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:59,087
We headlined every theater
from coast to coast.

286
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:01,161
And we played Europe too.

287
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:03,695
Mr. Cugat, we did all right in vaudeville.

288
00:23:03,865 --> 00:23:05,856
Mr. Buckley, vaudeville is dead.

289
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:09,760
Don't say that.
Vaudeville isn't dead, it's just resting.

290
00:23:09,938 --> 00:23:13,203
Why, in little towns all over the country,
before radio and pictures...

291
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,536
...it was their only source
of entertainment.

292
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,840
Mr. Cugat, maybe vaudeville
didn't shape the destiny of our country...

293
00:23:20,015 --> 00:23:22,711
...but it certainly gave it
a sense of humor.

294
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,530
Ladies and gentlemen...

295
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,067
...a while ago I introduced to you
some very charming people.

296
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:43,864
But Cugat is very sorry...

297
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:47,873
...because he forgot to introduce to you
a great personality...

298
00:23:48,043 --> 00:23:51,501
...a member of once-very-famous
vaudeville team:

299
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,171
Buckley of Clayton, Jackson and Buckley.

300
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,681
Let's give him a big hand.

301
00:24:05,227 --> 00:24:08,958
- Let's go with a tango, boys.
- Thank you, Mr. Cugat. I'm very flattered.

302
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:12,157
Yes, I'm very flattered.

303
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:13,733
Ladies and gentlemen...

304
00:24:13,902 --> 00:24:16,598
...l'm gonna sing a song
I sang many years ago.

305
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:22,038
Yes, it was many years ago
that I had an argument with Ziegfeld.

306
00:24:22,477 --> 00:24:25,605
Corner Broadway and 43rd.

307
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:28,082
Ziegfeld said, "Do you know who I am?"

308
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,047
I said, "Do you know who I am?"

309
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,344
He said, "Who are you?"

310
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,988
I said nothing. I was trapped.

311
00:24:34,156 --> 00:24:37,751
<i>But it makes no difference</i>
<i>What I started out to say</i>

312
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,790
<i>This is what I wish to convey</i>

313
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:45,831
<i>Now, I know darn well</i>
<i>I could do without Broadway</i>

314
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:48,526
<i>But could Broadway do without me?</i>

315
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:49,965
No! No!

316
00:24:50,138 --> 00:24:51,799
Herald Square. Times Square.

317
00:24:51,973 --> 00:24:54,100
Columbus Circle. 96th.

318
00:24:54,276 --> 00:24:57,177
What happened?
I must have passed my station.

319
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,671
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

320
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:04,216
You're supposed to follow the music,
not chase it all over the joint.

321
00:25:04,386 --> 00:25:05,978
Herald Square. Times Square.

322
00:25:06,154 --> 00:25:07,985
Columbus Circle.

323
00:25:08,156 --> 00:25:09,783
Columbus Circle.

324
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:12,449
It brings back memories
of the mustache cup...

325
00:25:12,627 --> 00:25:14,185
...the barbershop quartet...

326
00:25:14,362 --> 00:25:18,264
...and lest we forget, the bustle,
the secret of that era.

327
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,594
One night,
after finishing my performance...

328
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,330
...I was leaving the stage door
with a beautiful gal on my arm.

329
00:25:24,506 --> 00:25:27,634
It's possible.
My nose was much younger in those days.

330
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:30,107
I stepped into my hansom cab.

331
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,712
The lady preceded me, of course.

332
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:35,611
And as my trusty steed
turned his head for instructions...

333
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:39,550
...I grabbed the reins,
and this is what I said:

334
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,893
<i>Jog along, Mr. Dobbin</i>

335
00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:49,962
<i>And keep this carriage a-bobbin'</i>

336
00:25:50,565 --> 00:25:54,001
<i>We can't be late</i>
<i>For we have a date</i>

337
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:58,098
<i>I'm taking Miss Mary to the ball</i>

338
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:03,673
<i>My, oh, my, but she's pretty</i>

339
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:07,611
<i>The sweetest gal in the city</i>

340
00:26:08,216 --> 00:26:11,982
<i>How grand she'll look</i>
<i>When her picture's took</i>

341
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:16,214
<i>I'm taking Miss Mary to the ball</i>

342
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,455
- Gee, romantic, isn't it?
- Sure is.

343
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:25,327
See those two lovebirds
sitting on that branch over there?

344
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,697
- I sure do.
- Well, doesn't that give you any ideas?

345
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:33,432
Yes, but do you think that branch
is strong enough to hold the both of us?

346
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:37,269
<i>Jog along, Mr. Dobbin</i>

347
00:26:37,912 --> 00:26:41,348
<i>And keep this carriage a-bobbin'</i>

348
00:26:41,883 --> 00:26:45,614
<i>We can't be late</i>
<i>For it's her first date</i>

349
00:26:45,787 --> 00:26:48,278
<i>I'm taking Miss Mary to the ball</i>

350
00:26:48,456 --> 00:26:49,787
Everybody!

351
00:26:53,928 --> 00:26:56,192
<i>Jog along, Mr. Dobbin</i>

352
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,592
Let me hear you.

353
00:26:57,766 --> 00:27:00,360
<i>And keep this carriage a-bobbin'</i>

354
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,559
More melody.

355
00:27:01,736 --> 00:27:05,604
<i>We can't be late</i>
<i>For it's her first date</i>

356
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:08,675
<i>We're taking Miss Mary to the ball</i>

357
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:12,245
<i>Jog along, Mr. Dobbin</i>

358
00:27:12,414 --> 00:27:13,438
It's very melodious.

359
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:16,812
<i>And keep this carriage a-bobbin'</i>

360
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:21,014
<i>We can't be late</i>
<i>For it's her first date</i>

361
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:23,187
<i>We're taking Miss Mary</i>

362
00:27:23,358 --> 00:27:24,950
<i>A very merry Mary</i>

363
00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:32,794
<i>We're taking Miss Mary to the ball</i>

364
00:27:38,506 --> 00:27:40,770
Mr. Buckley, I can call on you again, no?

365
00:27:40,942 --> 00:27:44,207
Mr. Cugat,
you can call on me again, yes.

366
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:47,177
But I still say it's a mouse.

367
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:53,110
- I can't believe it.
- What do you mean?

368
00:27:53,288 --> 00:27:56,985
I used to get twice as much applause
when I played the Palace.

369
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,888
Oh, so that's it.

370
00:28:02,063 --> 00:28:05,362
Come on, lieutenant.
What you need is a change of scenery.

371
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,562
- What's that?
- Courtesy of the house.

372
00:28:43,738 --> 00:28:45,467
- Is that a drink?
- Sure.

373
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,267
Never touch the stuff.

374
00:28:47,442 --> 00:28:50,878
Drink is the greatest wrecker of men
since women was invented.

375
00:28:51,045 --> 00:28:53,605
Oh, come, now, Buckley,
what have you got against women?

376
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:55,079
Their feminine sex.

377
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,649
You can't trust them.

378
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,786
It's the same in the animal kingdom...

379
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:02,081
...from the biggest elephant
right down to the littlest spider.

380
00:29:02,257 --> 00:29:04,054
Now, take the spider family.

381
00:29:04,225 --> 00:29:08,753
You've heard of a black widow,
but did you ever hear of a black widower?

382
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:11,455
- No, but...
- And consider the busy bee.

383
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:14,124
Who's busy? Not the queen.

384
00:29:14,302 --> 00:29:16,896
She's sitting on her throne all day,
sipping honey.

385
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:18,663
And what's the male bee doing?

386
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,367
He's out knocking himself silly,
crash-diving at the petunias.

387
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:29,508
Women.

388
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:31,818
I just can't believe it.

389
00:29:31,986 --> 00:29:34,580
I can't believe
that she doesn't remember me.

390
00:29:34,756 --> 00:29:37,088
How could she forget someone
who loves her so much?

391
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:39,658
Wait a minute.
Who are you talking about?

392
00:29:39,828 --> 00:29:41,056
- Rosalind.
- Sure.

393
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:43,925
Who else would you be talking about?

394
00:29:44,566 --> 00:29:46,932
Buckley, I know what you're thinking.
You're wrong.

395
00:29:47,101 --> 00:29:49,729
This isn't just a flirtation or a whim.

396
00:29:49,904 --> 00:29:51,235
This is the real thing.

397
00:29:51,906 --> 00:29:53,965
I'll never forget the first time I saw her.

398
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:58,075
Just three years,
two months and four days ago.

399
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,843
She came down to our base
with an entertainment troupe.

400
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:03,141
She looked wonderful.

401
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,550
And tonight,
she wouldn't even dance with me.

402
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,656
She didn't remember.

403
00:30:09,824 --> 00:30:11,849
Look, son, let me tell you something.

404
00:30:12,026 --> 00:30:14,119
You were just one of a thousand
homesick guys.

405
00:30:14,295 --> 00:30:15,626
How could she remember?

406
00:30:15,797 --> 00:30:19,494
Besides, she's got somebody
to remember: Ricardo.

407
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:20,895
They're gonna be married.

408
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,833
- Now, forget it, will you?
- I won't forget it.

409
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:26,371
I'm in love with her,
don't you understand that?

410
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:28,566
Besides, I'm stubborn.

411
00:30:29,177 --> 00:30:31,907
I won't give up
until she's walking down that aisle.

412
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,547
I understand, kid.

413
00:30:33,715 --> 00:30:35,979
When I was your age, I was in love too.

414
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:39,278
- Yeah? What happened?
- She married someone else.

415
00:30:39,454 --> 00:30:41,888
But the Buckleys are stubborn too.

416
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:45,583
I didn't give up
till she was walking back up the aisle.

417
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,024
Buckley,
you and I have got a lot in common.

418
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:49,663
Yeah, we even look alike.

419
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,233
Oh, now, wait a minute.

420
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,698
We've both got classic profiles.

421
00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:57,531
Of course, yours is a little classier.

422
00:30:57,705 --> 00:31:00,640
Say, maybe we're cousins.

423
00:31:00,808 --> 00:31:02,105
Maybe we are.

424
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,075
What'd your family do?
Mine's been at sea for generations.

425
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,539
Mine never knew
what was going on either.

426
00:31:07,715 --> 00:31:10,149
They were strolling actors.
They trod the boards.

427
00:31:10,418 --> 00:31:12,181
A toast to you, Cousin Buckley.

428
00:31:12,353 --> 00:31:14,287
- One for all.
- All for one.

429
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,979
- You for me.
- Me for you.

430
00:31:16,157 --> 00:31:17,681
- Inseparable.
- Inseparable.

431
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:20,157
- Like ham and eggs.
- Like brandy and soda.

432
00:31:20,328 --> 00:31:21,556
And as the French say:

433
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:28,229
And a charlotte russe to you too,
Cousin Larry.

434
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:33,771
Oh, what a night
to be with someone you love.

435
00:31:33,942 --> 00:31:37,139
- Did you notice the moon, Buckley?
- No, what's it doing?

436
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,177
It'll keep me awake all night.

437
00:31:39,347 --> 00:31:42,748
Me too.
I got no curtains on my windows.

438
00:31:53,294 --> 00:31:55,353
Come on, Roz. Come on.

439
00:32:02,103 --> 00:32:04,435
A thing like this
could lead to pneumonia.

440
00:32:04,606 --> 00:32:05,834
She's beautiful, isn't she?

441
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:09,306
You've said that before.
Your vocabulary is very limited.

442
00:32:09,477 --> 00:32:11,877
Least she could have done
was to have danced with me.

443
00:32:12,046 --> 00:32:14,981
Cousin, you're trying my patience.
Forget it, will you?

444
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:17,276
I already told you, I can't forget it.

445
00:32:17,452 --> 00:32:20,853
- I'm still gonna dance with her.
- Sure. Sure, you're gonna dance with her.

446
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,183
But now you'd better turn in
and get some sleep.

447
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,383
You gotta fly that plane tomorrow.

448
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,187
That's right.

449
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:31,362
- I've gotta fly that plane tomorrow.
- Well, let's get going.

450
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:42,964
- Roz, I've got an idea.
- What is it, Rick?

451
00:33:43,137 --> 00:33:45,901
We're going to have three days off
after tomorrow.

452
00:33:46,074 --> 00:33:48,440
Let's not wait until we get home.

453
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,702
Let's get married here. Now.

454
00:33:50,878 --> 00:33:53,608
- Will you, Roz?
- Oh, Rick, you know I would...

455
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:57,342
...but Mr. Fitz promised us a big wedding
right after we finish the picture.

456
00:33:57,518 --> 00:33:59,486
We can't disappoint him, can we?

457
00:33:59,887 --> 00:34:01,218
No, I guess we can't.

458
00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:03,289
He's been pretty swell.

459
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:41,860
- Everything's all set for the pagan number.
- All right, get your people in position.

460
00:34:42,029 --> 00:34:44,361
- Rick, Roz.
- Everybody on the set.

461
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:45,760
Dancers, take your places.

462
00:34:45,933 --> 00:34:49,198
Now, this is the dance given in honor
of your leaving the island, Rick.

463
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:52,032
Roz, you're still hoping
that Rick's gonna take you along.

464
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:54,231
You watch the dance.
You're interested in it.

465
00:34:54,408 --> 00:34:56,399
And, Roz, you're more
interested in Ricardo.

466
00:34:56,577 --> 00:34:58,875
- All right, George.
- Okay. Take your places.

467
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,670
Everything ready?

468
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,942
- Okay.
- Roll them.

469
00:35:04,418 --> 00:35:06,215
Don't forget what he said.

470
00:35:06,387 --> 00:35:08,412
You're interested in me.

471
00:35:10,091 --> 00:35:11,115
Drums.

472
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:56,754
All right, cut it.

473
00:37:56,924 --> 00:37:58,152
- Print it, Jane.
- Okay.

474
00:37:58,326 --> 00:38:01,193
All right, everybody.
Next setup at the airplane.

475
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,058
Lieutenant, in this next scene,
you double for Ricardo...

476
00:38:04,231 --> 00:38:05,357
...so listen carefully.

477
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,262
I want you to get in the airplane.

478
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:09,630
Tanya, that's Miss Rennolds,
unknown to you...

479
00:38:09,804 --> 00:38:12,364
...will crawl in the gunner's compartment
and stow away.

480
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,531
I want you to take off, circle the field...

481
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,644
...wave to the natives below,
then head due north.

482
00:38:17,812 --> 00:38:19,973
- Do you follow me?
- Yes, sir.

483
00:38:20,147 --> 00:38:23,173
Miss Rennolds stows away in my airplane,
I don't know she's there.

484
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:25,615
I circle the field,
wave and head due north.

485
00:38:25,786 --> 00:38:28,983
Keep your radio on. We'll give you a call
the minute the shot is over.

486
00:38:29,156 --> 00:38:31,954
I want you to come back in and land.
Got everything straight?

487
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:33,650
Yes, sir.

488
00:38:33,828 --> 00:38:35,090
I certainly have.

489
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:42,869
You'll enter from there
as soon as the officer's back is to you.

490
00:38:43,037 --> 00:38:45,835
Lieutenant, I want you
to start from here on "action."

491
00:38:46,007 --> 00:38:47,497
- Be careful, will you?
- Yes, sir.

492
00:38:47,675 --> 00:38:49,643
- Buckley, is that other camera ready?
- Yes.

493
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,244
Okay. Places, everybody.

494
00:38:54,382 --> 00:38:55,906
- Are you ready, boss?
- All ready.

495
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,880
- Roll them.
- Speed.

496
00:38:58,052 --> 00:39:00,043
Action, please.

497
00:39:37,558 --> 00:39:39,753
Cut it. Fine. Wonderful.

498
00:39:39,927 --> 00:39:42,054
Okay, get them down, Buckley.

499
00:39:42,229 --> 00:39:43,696
Next setup at the pool.

500
00:39:43,864 --> 00:39:46,765
This'll be the jealousy scene
between you, Yvonne and Rosalind.

501
00:39:46,934 --> 00:39:48,265
Right.

502
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:53,033
Calling Lieutenant Kingslee.
Calling Lieutenant Kingslee.

503
00:39:53,207 --> 00:39:56,176
All right, lieutenant, come back now.

504
00:40:01,582 --> 00:40:03,880
<i>Larry, come back.</i>

505
00:40:04,518 --> 00:40:05,780
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

506
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,750
<i>Larry. Coz!</i>

507
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,689
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

508
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:12,723
<i>Larry. Coz...</i>

509
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:21,531
Give that a little twist, will you?

510
00:40:21,702 --> 00:40:24,865
- Lieutenant.
- He must've misunderstood our directions.

511
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:27,269
- Larry, coz.
- Why doesn't he come back?

512
00:40:27,441 --> 00:40:29,932
- Where is he going?
- Maybe he's taking her for a ride.

513
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:32,477
Sure, that's it.
He's taking her for a little ride.

514
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,613
Taking her for a ride?
Maybe she doesn't want to take a ride.

515
00:40:35,783 --> 00:40:37,216
Can't you get him to come back?

516
00:40:37,384 --> 00:40:39,409
- Buckley, get him back.
- Better get him back.

517
00:40:39,587 --> 00:40:42,715
- Tell him to cut out the kidding.
- "Yeah, Buckley, get him back."

518
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:45,188
Who do you think I am, Superman?

519
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,123
What do you suppose we should...?
Look who I'm talking to.

520
00:40:48,295 --> 00:40:49,819
Yes, sir.

521
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:51,562
Lieutenant.

522
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:54,858
Hello, Navy 2011. Go ahead.

523
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:57,094
<i>This is Navy 2011 reporting.</i>

524
00:40:57,271 --> 00:40:59,205
<i>No plane sighted. Over.</i>

525
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:02,809
Roger. Hello, Navy 5001.

526
00:41:02,977 --> 00:41:05,070
What could have happened?
Where could they be?

527
00:41:05,246 --> 00:41:08,079
- Why can't we do something?
- Everything possible's being done.

528
00:41:08,249 --> 00:41:10,581
They couldn't disappear.
They have to be someplace.

529
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:13,345
We have search planes
covering every possible territory.

530
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:17,082
<i>Hello, Navy Tower.</i>
<i>This is Navy 5001 reporting.</i>

531
00:41:17,258 --> 00:41:19,158
- What is it?
<i>- Nothing on Kingslee's plane.</i>

532
00:41:19,326 --> 00:41:21,351
<i>We're continuing the search</i>
<i>to the northeast.</i>

533
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:23,656
- Roger.
- Nothing to report.

534
00:41:23,831 --> 00:41:27,597
All I ask is that they find one plane,
and he has nothing to report.

535
00:41:27,768 --> 00:41:30,293
Ricardo, you can't help matters any
by getting excited.

536
00:41:30,471 --> 00:41:31,938
Now, sit down, relax.

537
00:41:32,106 --> 00:41:34,131
All we can do
is wait and hope for the best.

538
00:41:34,308 --> 00:41:38,574
My future wife has disappeared in the air
and you ask me to sit down and relax?

539
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,407
Relax.

540
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,141
Buckley, you know
this Lieutenant Kingslee.

541
00:41:43,317 --> 00:41:45,581
- You don't think he would harm her?
- Harm her?

542
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,415
Of course not.
He wouldn't harm a kitten.

543
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,020
What do we know about him?
Where did he come from?

544
00:41:51,192 --> 00:41:52,989
- Who picked him?
- I picked him.

545
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,388
- You picked him?
- Sure.

546
00:41:54,562 --> 00:41:57,929
They said they wanted a clean-cut,
nice-looking lieutenant who could fly.

547
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:01,556
- But what about his character?
- In uniforms, their characters didn't show.

548
00:42:01,735 --> 00:42:04,067
So I picked the one
that wanted the job the most.

549
00:42:04,238 --> 00:42:07,173
How did I know he had a crush on Roz?

550
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:09,740
He had a crush on Roz?

551
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,674
What's wrong with that?
She's a gorgeous girl.

552
00:42:12,846 --> 00:42:14,541
Lots of guys got a crush on her.

553
00:42:14,715 --> 00:42:15,943
I got a crush on her.

554
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,607
Even he's got a crush on her.

555
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,744
Yes, sir.

556
00:42:48,782 --> 00:42:50,374
I'm not getting out of this plane.

557
00:42:50,551 --> 00:42:53,952
You turn right around and take me back
this minute. This minute, you hear?

558
00:42:54,388 --> 00:42:57,414
I'll take you back, Miss Rennolds.
I'll take you back in one hour.

559
00:42:57,591 --> 00:42:59,559
If you're good
and get out of the airplane.

560
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:02,191
Give me one good reason why I should.

561
00:43:02,863 --> 00:43:05,525
Because I won't take you back
unless you do.

562
00:43:07,401 --> 00:43:09,460
Do you promise to take me back
in an hour?

563
00:43:09,637 --> 00:43:11,002
Promise.

564
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,399
All right.

565
00:43:12,606 --> 00:43:16,042
Never mind. I'll get out the way I got in.

566
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:29,919
I don't need your help, thank you.

567
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:31,751
Follow me.

568
00:43:38,732 --> 00:43:39,960
Oh, no.

569
00:43:40,668 --> 00:43:42,363
You're wasting time, Miss Rennolds.

570
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:45,164
It'll be an hour and 10 minutes.

571
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:58,441
Won't you sit down, please?

572
00:44:14,668 --> 00:44:18,035
Miss Rennolds, may I have the pleasure
of the next dance, please?

573
00:44:27,381 --> 00:44:30,612
Did you fly all the way out here
just to dance with me?

574
00:44:30,784 --> 00:44:32,274
That's right.

575
00:44:32,453 --> 00:44:35,388
I promised someone very close to me
that I'd dance with you.

576
00:44:35,556 --> 00:44:37,922
- Who?
- Me.

577
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,851
Lieutenant Kingslee, are you crazy?

578
00:44:41,028 --> 00:44:43,929
Yes. About you.

579
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:07,583
Did you really fly me clear out here
just to dance with me?

580
00:45:07,755 --> 00:45:09,313
That's right.

581
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:11,424
I like to dance.

582
00:45:11,592 --> 00:45:13,526
Especially with you.

583
00:45:22,403 --> 00:45:24,997
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

584
00:45:25,172 --> 00:45:26,935
Now, will you please take me back?

585
00:45:27,574 --> 00:45:30,839
All right, Miss Rennolds.
I'll take you back.

586
00:45:31,011 --> 00:45:32,342
Okay.

587
00:45:47,027 --> 00:45:50,758
- This isn't the way we came.
- No, it's a shortcut.

588
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:04,201
Lieutenant, are you sure
you know where you're going?

589
00:46:04,378 --> 00:46:05,402
Of course I know.

590
00:46:19,793 --> 00:46:21,761
Does this look familiar?

591
00:46:21,929 --> 00:46:25,160
- What's the name of this island, lieutenant?
- Kulowama.

592
00:46:25,332 --> 00:46:26,492
Kulowama.

593
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:29,500
Three years, five months,
two days and about six hours ago...

594
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,605
...you flew in here with an
accordion player and a bathing suit.

595
00:46:32,773 --> 00:46:35,435
When you put the bathing suit on,
nothing else mattered.

596
00:46:35,609 --> 00:46:38,305
Well, wasn't there a diving board
fastened to a tree?

597
00:46:38,946 --> 00:46:40,345
Yeah, that one.

598
00:46:40,514 --> 00:46:43,711
You dove off and swam around
to the accordion, you sang a little song.

599
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,681
- "If I Were You."
- Now I remember.

600
00:46:45,853 --> 00:46:48,720
I called for a volunteer to come up
and play in a little skit.

601
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,356
That's right, 500 hands went up.

602
00:46:50,524 --> 00:46:54,051
I know. Didn't make any difference.
I had him all picked out beforehand.

603
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,196
The commandant used to tip me off.

604
00:46:56,363 --> 00:46:58,593
It was always the shyest,
the most bashful or...

605
00:46:58,765 --> 00:47:01,029
Or the one who was craziest about you.

606
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:03,965
- That was me.
- It was?

607
00:47:04,838 --> 00:47:06,305
It still is.

608
00:47:06,473 --> 00:47:09,965
- Do you remember how it ended?
- The skit? Of course. You kissed me.

609
00:47:10,277 --> 00:47:11,505
You kissed me back.

610
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:15,807
Well, that was all part of the act.
It didn't mean a thing.

611
00:47:15,983 --> 00:47:19,282
It did to me. What about that night
when I walked you to your quarters?

612
00:47:19,453 --> 00:47:22,388
- What about all those nice things you said?
- Larry...

613
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:25,457
Lieutenant, I don't remember what I said.

614
00:47:25,626 --> 00:47:28,652
There were so many islands,
so many boys.

615
00:47:28,829 --> 00:47:32,321
It was all part of the war effort,
keeping up their morale.

616
00:47:32,499 --> 00:47:34,558
Well, it sure shot mine full of holes.

617
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:41,098
Lieutenant, I'm sorry. Really, I am.

618
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,606
And what about yesterday?

619
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,767
You did the same thing.
You kissed me again.

620
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:48,005
Well, in the first place, I didn't kiss you,
you kissed me.

621
00:47:48,181 --> 00:47:50,115
And secondly, I was acting.

622
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:53,947
Why, it was just exactly
like kissing cardboard.

623
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,884
Thanks a lot.

624
00:47:56,056 --> 00:47:57,887
You don't understand.

625
00:47:58,058 --> 00:48:02,927
Look, when I'm playing a scene,
my head controls my emotions perfectly.

626
00:48:03,096 --> 00:48:07,396
Why, I could kiss you right now
exactly the same way.

627
00:48:10,003 --> 00:48:11,493
All right, go ahead.

628
00:48:11,672 --> 00:48:13,697
- What?
- I said, go ahead.

629
00:48:14,841 --> 00:48:16,809
What's the matter, you afraid?

630
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:20,469
Well, certainly not. That's ridiculous.

631
00:48:37,731 --> 00:48:39,028
See what I mean?

632
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:41,565
It's nothing.

633
00:48:43,937 --> 00:48:45,802
Let's go home.

634
00:48:49,543 --> 00:48:53,912
- Well, you don't have to walk so fast.
- Sorry, I thought you were in a hurry.

635
00:48:54,414 --> 00:48:57,281
- What's the matter?
- Plenty.

636
00:48:58,752 --> 00:49:01,220
The wheel's gone.

637
00:49:07,227 --> 00:49:08,819
They certainly helped themselves.

638
00:49:09,596 --> 00:49:11,655
Do you mean we're trapped here?

639
00:49:11,832 --> 00:49:14,767
I'm afraid so, until I can find the stuff.

640
00:49:19,606 --> 00:49:21,506
How dared you bring me here?

641
00:49:21,675 --> 00:49:23,802
This whole thing is your fault
and you know it.

642
00:49:23,977 --> 00:49:27,708
- Of all the stupid, meddlesome, blundering...
- It was a mistake bringing you here.

643
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:31,282
A big mistake, and I'm very sorry,
but that isn't gonna start the airplane.

644
00:49:31,451 --> 00:49:33,419
This is just another trick
to keep me here.

645
00:49:33,587 --> 00:49:36,784
I wouldn't be a bit surprised
if you didn't hide that wheel yourself.

646
00:49:36,957 --> 00:49:40,085
You seem to forget I haven't been
out of your sight since we landed.

647
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,228
Then what happened to it?
Where did it go?

648
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:46,355
- It didn't just get up and walk off by itself.
- My guess is the inhabitants took it.

649
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:48,891
Inhabitants?

650
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,627
You mean people live here?

651
00:49:51,004 --> 00:49:53,598
Yes, a native settlement
on the other side of the jungle.

652
00:49:53,774 --> 00:49:57,301
They're probably headhunters
and I'll never leave this island alive.

653
00:49:57,477 --> 00:49:58,739
I just know it.

654
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,573
Oh, please, Miss Rennolds.

655
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:03,307
Please don't worry,
I'll get you home safely. I promise.

656
00:50:03,483 --> 00:50:05,576
Won't you climb into the ship
till I get back?

657
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,721
- Back? Where are you going?
- To the village.

658
00:50:08,889 --> 00:50:12,086
- You're not gonna leave me here alone?
- I can hardly take you with me.

659
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,523
It's a long, hard trek
straight through the jungle.

660
00:50:14,695 --> 00:50:16,287
Now, please, get into the airplane.

661
00:50:16,463 --> 00:50:19,523
First you want me to get out of it,
now you want me to get back in.

662
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,497
Well, I won't. I'm going with you.

663
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:24,961
Look, a tropical jungle
is not like a movie jungle, Miss Rennolds.

664
00:50:25,138 --> 00:50:27,606
They have all kinds
of strange things like leeches...

665
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,572
You meet those everywhere.
Come on, let's go.

666
00:50:30,744 --> 00:50:32,803
Very well, but remember,
this isn't my idea.

667
00:50:32,979 --> 00:50:35,243
Keep up with me.
We gotta get there before dark.

668
00:50:35,415 --> 00:50:37,679
By all means.

669
00:50:41,822 --> 00:50:43,153
Oh, what's that?

670
00:50:43,323 --> 00:50:45,757
Just a kiamishi bird calling to his mate.

671
00:50:45,926 --> 00:50:47,894
Don't tell me he ever gets an answer.

672
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:52,921
Miss Rennolds, for every male kiamishi,
there's a female kiamishi.

673
00:51:01,074 --> 00:51:02,063
See what I mean?

674
00:51:03,043 --> 00:51:04,635
Miss Rennolds?

675
00:51:05,245 --> 00:51:06,803
Rosalind?

676
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,375
Rosalind, where are you?

677
00:51:10,584 --> 00:51:12,609
Rosalind? Answer me.

678
00:51:12,786 --> 00:51:14,879
Over here.

679
00:51:15,055 --> 00:51:16,784
Lieutenant.

680
00:51:16,957 --> 00:51:20,393
- Miss Rennolds, are you all right?
- Oh, of course I'm all right.

681
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,552
- I'll be right down and help you up.
- No. No, you won't.

682
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:25,357
Give me your coat.

683
00:51:25,532 --> 00:51:29,798
Oh, believe me,
if I ever get out of this place alive, I'll...

684
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:31,961
- Oh, I'll...
- Here, you got it?

685
00:51:32,139 --> 00:51:34,130
- Yes.
- Okay, tell me when you're ready.

686
00:51:34,307 --> 00:51:36,332
I'll let you know when I'm ready.

687
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,206
And when I do, there'll be
one less lieutenant in the Navy.

688
00:51:39,379 --> 00:51:41,279
All right, now, give me both hands.

689
00:51:43,984 --> 00:51:45,474
Easy.

690
00:51:45,652 --> 00:51:47,279
Easy.

691
00:51:49,222 --> 00:51:50,849
You all right?

692
00:51:51,124 --> 00:51:53,558
Oh, I'm fine. Wonderful.

693
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,092
Couldn't be better.

694
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,887
Lieutenant Kingslee,
if you had to join the Navy...

695
00:51:58,064 --> 00:52:00,191
...couldn't you have been happy
in a submarine?

696
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,130
Did you have to take up flying?

697
00:52:02,302 --> 00:52:04,702
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Miss Rennolds.
I really am.

698
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:07,465
- Do you hurt anyplace?
- Oh, I hurt everyplace.

699
00:52:07,641 --> 00:52:09,404
Don't you touch me.

700
00:52:09,576 --> 00:52:12,340
- Miss Rennolds, you're hysterical.
- I'm not hysterical!

701
00:52:12,512 --> 00:52:16,107
I loathe hysterics.
I've never been hysterical in my whole life.

702
00:52:16,283 --> 00:52:17,841
Then why are you crying?

703
00:52:18,018 --> 00:52:21,215
Because I hate you, that's why.
I hate you.

704
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:24,846
If you'll put your arms around my neck,
I'll carry you back to the shack.

705
00:52:25,025 --> 00:52:29,394
If I put my arms around your neck,
I would choke you.

706
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,900
Don't you touch me.

707
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,507
Miss Rennolds,
is there anything I can do for you?

708
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:49,206
You may as well know it right now,
there's nothing you can do for me.

709
00:52:49,616 --> 00:52:51,948
You've done everything
you could possibly do.

710
00:52:53,653 --> 00:52:55,280
Yes, Miss Rennolds.

711
00:52:59,693 --> 00:53:03,459
- Are you hungry?
- Yes. But I'm not speaking to you.

712
00:53:04,064 --> 00:53:05,759
Excuse me.

713
00:53:28,221 --> 00:53:30,416
Larry!

714
00:53:33,093 --> 00:53:34,993
Larry!

715
00:53:35,161 --> 00:53:37,425
- What's the matter?
- Get him out! Take him away!

716
00:53:37,597 --> 00:53:39,827
- Who?
- That!

717
00:53:40,033 --> 00:53:44,060
Oh, Miss Rennolds, that's only a land crab.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

718
00:53:55,247 --> 00:53:58,080
What's the matter? Did she frighten you?

719
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:00,013
Oh, get him away from me.

720
00:54:00,553 --> 00:54:03,351
Oh, Miss Rennolds, you're a big girl now.

721
00:54:08,394 --> 00:54:10,487
I brought you something to eat.

722
00:54:10,663 --> 00:54:12,028
I hate bananas.

723
00:54:12,198 --> 00:54:14,792
I hate coconuts too.
I hate you most of all.

724
00:54:14,967 --> 00:54:18,198
As far as I'm concerned,
you can take those out and bury them.

725
00:54:18,371 --> 00:54:20,931
Bury them. Wait a minute.
That reminds me of something.

726
00:54:21,107 --> 00:54:23,598
Spam. We used to bury it.

727
00:54:26,178 --> 00:54:31,741
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

728
00:54:31,917 --> 00:54:33,441
...eight...

729
00:54:36,088 --> 00:54:37,749
...nine...

730
00:54:40,593 --> 00:54:42,458
Eleven.

731
00:55:30,042 --> 00:55:33,637
- Will you have your dinners now?
- Just bring us coffee, please.

732
00:55:33,813 --> 00:55:37,112
- Again?
- Yes, again.

733
00:56:45,017 --> 00:56:46,780
Is there any news? You heard anything?

734
00:56:46,952 --> 00:56:49,352
No, nothing.
All we can do now is wait till morning.

735
00:56:49,522 --> 00:56:52,491
Why? Why can't we continue
searching tonight? Why must we wait?

736
00:56:52,658 --> 00:56:55,991
There's so many islands, Rick.
They couldn't possibly find them tonight.

737
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,390
They'll find them.

738
00:56:57,563 --> 00:57:00,691
People are beginning to ask questions,
and I ain't got the answers.

739
00:57:00,866 --> 00:57:02,333
Now may I serve your dinners?

740
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:05,334
Just keep the coffee cups filled, Tommy.
That's all.

741
00:57:05,504 --> 00:57:08,962
- Oh, you're waiting for Miss Rennolds?
- Coffee, boy.

742
00:57:11,644 --> 00:57:13,669
See what I mean?

743
00:57:14,146 --> 00:57:17,206
Buckley, give everybody
a 9:00 shooting call for tomorrow morning.

744
00:57:17,383 --> 00:57:19,112
Shoot Rick and Yvonne's love scene.

745
00:57:19,285 --> 00:57:21,276
- You mean we work tomorrow?
- Yes.

746
00:57:21,453 --> 00:57:22,943
Oh, I couldn't work, George.

747
00:57:23,122 --> 00:57:26,853
Look, Rick, if we could help matters any
by not working, we wouldn't...

748
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,550
...but there's nothing we can do.

749
00:57:28,727 --> 00:57:30,718
I tell you, I can't. I'm sorry.

750
00:57:30,896 --> 00:57:34,423
Rick, in show business,
you work whether you feel like it or not.

751
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,194
Nobody cares
about your personal troubles.

752
00:57:37,369 --> 00:57:40,065
There are times when you feel like crying,
you gotta laugh.

753
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:44,642
And when you feel like laughing,
you gotta cry. That's show business.

754
00:57:46,512 --> 00:57:49,174
Okay, George, I'll have everybody
on the set at 9 sharp.

755
00:57:49,448 --> 00:57:52,940
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Buckley said
we can call on him anytime.

756
00:57:53,118 --> 00:57:57,487
How about it? Would you like
to have him sing a song for you?

757
00:57:58,324 --> 00:58:01,191
You see, Mr. Buckley,
everybody, they want you back.

758
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,157
Maybe you have another song for us, no?

759
00:58:03,896 --> 00:58:05,989
Go on, Buckley.

760
00:58:06,432 --> 00:58:10,596
- No, not tonight.
- That's show business, remember?

761
00:58:11,604 --> 00:58:12,628
Yeah.

762
00:58:23,148 --> 00:58:25,116
I don't see how he can do it.

763
00:58:25,284 --> 00:58:28,549
When you've been in this business
as long as he has, you'll understand.

764
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:38,257
<i>I just got back from Washington today</i>

765
00:58:39,198 --> 00:58:41,996
<i>And really, folks, I've got a lot to say</i>

766
00:58:43,168 --> 00:58:46,501
<i>While I was there</i>
<i>I met the adjutant general</i>

767
00:58:46,672 --> 00:58:49,766
<i>And what he told me put me in a daze</i>

768
00:58:49,942 --> 00:58:53,901
<i>Why, for days and days</i>
<i>And days and days</i>

769
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,377
<i>And days and days</i>
<i>For a week</i>

770
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:01,180
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

771
00:59:01,353 --> 00:59:03,321
I'm working here too.

772
00:59:03,489 --> 00:59:04,717
The adjutant general said:

773
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:08,257
"Jimmy, you've been invited
to entertain at the White House."

774
00:59:08,427 --> 00:59:11,396
He said, "lt'll be a gathering
of the intelligentsia...

775
00:59:11,563 --> 00:59:16,330
...the hoi polloi, the 400, the 500,
the 600, the 700, the 800."

776
00:59:17,903 --> 00:59:21,703
How do you like that?
Everywhere you go, critics.

777
00:59:21,874 --> 00:59:26,311
Then he said, "Jimmy, what'll you do
when you're called upon to entertain?"

778
00:59:26,478 --> 00:59:30,209
I said, "Mr. Adjutant General,
what'll I do? I'll tell you."

779
00:59:30,382 --> 00:59:33,874
Why, in the midst of festivities,
I'll get up, I'll get up.

780
00:59:34,053 --> 00:59:35,520
<i>And do my strutaway</i>

781
00:59:36,121 --> 00:59:37,588
<i>In my cutaway</i>

782
00:59:37,756 --> 00:59:41,214
<i>It's just a hop-away</i>
<i>A slide-away and a scram-away</i>

783
00:59:41,393 --> 00:59:44,794
<i>And then you skitter right down</i>
<i>Then you go to town with a twist-away</i>

784
00:59:44,963 --> 00:59:48,922
<i>Now, when you strutaway thisaway</i>
<i>It's a holiday</i>

785
00:59:49,101 --> 00:59:52,400
You know, I was dancing the strutaway
with a girl named Suzette...

786
00:59:52,571 --> 00:59:55,734
...when she accidentally backed
into a hot radiator.

787
00:59:55,908 --> 00:59:57,432
Crêpe suzette.

788
01:00:00,412 --> 01:00:03,870
<i>It's a dance that's gonna gain</i>
<i>Great renown</i>

789
01:00:04,049 --> 01:00:07,883
You know, a beautiful girl invited me up
to her apartment to teach her this dance.

790
01:00:08,053 --> 01:00:12,046
I wasn't in the apartment 10 minutes,
when who walks in? Her husband.

791
01:00:12,224 --> 01:00:15,455
Kind of perturbed. He said,
"What are you doing here?"

792
01:00:15,627 --> 01:00:18,460
<i>I said, "I'm puttin' on my white tie</i>

793
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:20,359
<i>I'm puttin' on my top hat</i>

794
01:00:20,532 --> 01:00:22,227
<i>I'm puttin' on my topcoat</i>

795
01:00:22,401 --> 01:00:24,335
<i>To make my getaway"</i>

796
01:00:24,503 --> 01:00:25,731
<i>Doin' the strutaway</i>

797
01:00:26,572 --> 01:00:30,201
<i>Did you ever have the feelin'</i>
<i>That you wanted to do the strutaway?</i>

798
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:31,809
<i>The hop-away</i>

799
01:00:31,977 --> 01:00:33,467
<i>The scram-away</i>

800
01:00:33,645 --> 01:00:35,909
<i>And then you skitter right down</i>
<i>And you go to town</i>

801
01:00:36,081 --> 01:00:37,776
<i>Doin' the strutaway</i>

802
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:39,508
<i>The hop-away</i>

803
01:00:39,685 --> 01:00:42,620
<i>The scram-away once more</i>

804
01:00:49,595 --> 01:00:51,358
Señor Buckley, you are <i>magnífico.</i>

805
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:55,261
And in appreciation, Cugie likes
to give you something very dear to him.

806
01:00:55,434 --> 01:00:57,163
- Take Chita.
- Oh, no.

807
01:00:57,336 --> 01:00:59,896
I wouldn't take him away from you.

808
01:01:00,072 --> 01:01:01,699
I'm not his type.

809
01:01:01,874 --> 01:01:05,503
Thanks, Mr. Cugat. Thanks a million.

810
01:01:09,681 --> 01:01:12,582
- Any news, commander?
- No news.

811
01:01:12,751 --> 01:01:15,777
Did you know that Lieutenant Kingslee
had met Rosalind before?

812
01:01:15,954 --> 01:01:17,182
He did?

813
01:01:17,356 --> 01:01:21,850
According to the boys at the base, he met
her on one of those entertainment tours.

814
01:01:22,027 --> 01:01:24,359
- Yeah?
- And another thing:

815
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:26,293
You didn't pick him, he picked you.

816
01:01:27,032 --> 01:01:28,624
He bribed his entire squadron...

817
01:01:28,801 --> 01:01:31,565
...so that when you asked for a volunteer,
he'd be selected.

818
01:01:31,737 --> 01:01:33,398
- No.
- Yes.

819
01:01:35,207 --> 01:01:39,405
I should have stayed in vaudeville.
Then this never would have happened.

820
01:01:46,785 --> 01:01:49,049
Lieutenant, I'm sorry
about this afternoon.

821
01:01:49,221 --> 01:01:50,882
I was hysterical.

822
01:01:51,056 --> 01:01:53,251
I know. I don't blame you.

823
01:01:53,425 --> 01:01:56,087
I shouldn't have brought you here
in the first place.

824
01:01:56,695 --> 01:01:59,858
Well, at least the hole I fell into
wasn't your fault.

825
01:02:00,032 --> 01:02:01,966
You didn't dig that.

826
01:02:02,134 --> 01:02:05,831
Miss Rennolds,
it's quite possible that I did.

827
01:02:06,004 --> 01:02:09,064
I used to dig foxholes out here
all day long.

828
01:02:10,042 --> 01:02:12,510
And at night,
I used to lay out under the stars...

829
01:02:12,678 --> 01:02:14,839
...and pretend you were with me.

830
01:02:15,347 --> 01:02:18,316
Every morning at dawn,
we'd go swimming together.

831
01:02:18,951 --> 01:02:22,114
Dawn's the most beautiful time of all
on the island.

832
01:02:22,888 --> 01:02:26,051
Then we'd just stretch out
in the sun and talk for hours.

833
01:02:27,593 --> 01:02:29,618
How about some more food?

834
01:02:33,198 --> 01:02:34,893
Oh, couldn't eat another mouthful.

835
01:02:35,067 --> 01:02:38,036
Oh, come on.
One more bite, like a good girl.

836
01:02:41,206 --> 01:02:44,198
You know, lieutenant,
you'd make a wonderful mother.

837
01:02:44,877 --> 01:02:47,471
I've always thought the same about you.

838
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:53,981
Good night.

839
01:02:56,788 --> 01:02:59,621
- Miss Rennolds.
- Yes?

840
01:03:00,259 --> 01:03:03,490
You can use this cap as a pillow.
Might be a little more comfortable.

841
01:03:05,264 --> 01:03:07,994
Thank you. Good night.

842
01:03:20,879 --> 01:03:22,710
Larry?

843
01:03:23,115 --> 01:03:24,343
Yes?

844
01:03:24,516 --> 01:03:27,314
When we used to stretch out
in the sun and talk for hours...

845
01:03:27,486 --> 01:03:29,716
...what did we talk about?

846
01:03:29,888 --> 01:03:30,912
Our future.

847
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:35,419
I'm spending my future
with Ricardo, Larry.

848
01:03:35,594 --> 01:03:38,961
I know. But you spent
an awful lot of your past with me.

849
01:03:40,465 --> 01:03:42,365
Good night.

850
01:04:18,470 --> 01:04:21,371
<i>Larry. Lieutenant.</i>

851
01:04:22,307 --> 01:04:23,865
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

852
01:04:24,042 --> 01:04:28,308
<i>Oh, Larry. Come on, Larry.</i>

853
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,504
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

854
01:04:35,854 --> 01:04:38,414
Hurry up, Larry.

855
01:05:02,948 --> 01:05:05,576
Admiral, attention.

856
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:09,014
Lieutenant, at ease.

857
01:05:12,758 --> 01:05:14,988
Fleet, attention.

858
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,754
Maneuver to the right.

859
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:21,796
Throw out your anchors.

860
01:06:09,948 --> 01:06:13,440
- He can't do that. She's my girl.
- Oh, yes, he can. She's his girl.

861
01:06:13,618 --> 01:06:15,950
There's the girl for you.

862
01:06:23,695 --> 01:06:25,492
Wonderful, isn't she?

863
01:06:25,664 --> 01:06:28,258
I know she's wonderful.
But that's the girl for me.

864
01:06:28,433 --> 01:06:31,459
- Look, coz, it won't work.
- Why not? I'm in love with her.

865
01:06:31,636 --> 01:06:34,867
- Are you?
- Am I?

866
01:06:42,447 --> 01:06:44,574
Come on, lieutenant.

867
01:08:14,873 --> 01:08:19,207
I'm sorry, Larry.
I met you too late in my life.

868
01:08:24,015 --> 01:08:26,279
Lieutenant.

869
01:08:27,152 --> 01:08:28,949
Wake up.

870
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,883
It's late.

871
01:08:31,756 --> 01:08:33,951
Please, Roz, don't say that.

872
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:37,458
It can't be too late.
It'll never be too late.

873
01:08:37,896 --> 01:08:39,363
What?

874
01:08:41,233 --> 01:08:43,360
Oh, Miss Rennolds.
I must have been dreaming.

875
01:08:43,535 --> 01:08:47,027
Well, you'd better stop dreaming.
It's time we went after those plane parts.

876
01:08:47,205 --> 01:08:49,867
"We"? Oh, no.
I think you better stay in the shack.

877
01:08:50,041 --> 01:08:53,772
- Well, how long will you be gone?
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.

878
01:08:54,212 --> 01:08:58,615
Promise me you'll stay here till I get back?
There's nothing to be afraid of.

879
01:08:58,783 --> 01:09:00,808
All right.

880
01:09:07,158 --> 01:09:09,683
- Miss Rennolds?
- Yes?

881
01:09:10,061 --> 01:09:14,020
Miss Rennolds, if I'd met you
before Ricardo, would I have had a chance?

882
01:09:15,133 --> 01:09:20,036
I did meet you before I met Ricardo,
Larry, a long time before.

883
01:09:34,052 --> 01:09:35,986
Did you ever do any flying before?

884
01:09:36,154 --> 01:09:41,387
No, and if I had my way, I'd have had
the stork that brought me walk.

885
01:09:58,076 --> 01:09:59,634
Looks like this is it.

886
01:09:59,811 --> 01:10:01,802
Keep your fingers crossed.
We're going down.

887
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:05,643
I ain't had them uncrossed
since I got into this eggbeater.

888
01:10:28,606 --> 01:10:31,040
Oh, darling, are you all right?
I was so worried.

889
01:10:31,209 --> 01:10:34,872
- You're not hurt, are you?
- No, dear, I'm fine, really.

890
01:10:36,648 --> 01:10:40,414
Oh, Buckley, are you here too?
You used to be afraid of airplanes.

891
01:10:40,585 --> 01:10:43,986
I still am, Roz.
Where's that crazy lieutenant?

892
01:10:44,155 --> 01:10:47,613
He went through the jungle looking
for some native village he talked about.

893
01:10:47,792 --> 01:10:50,625
- Pardon me, I'm Commander Harrisen.
- How do you do, commander?

894
01:10:50,795 --> 01:10:53,992
Would you mind telling me exactly
what happened? Were you forced down?

895
01:10:54,799 --> 01:10:57,199
Commander,
I know it's gonna sound a little silly...

896
01:10:57,369 --> 01:11:00,861
...but that lieutenant flew me
all the way out here just to dance with me.

897
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:03,473
You mean he flew you 500 miles
just for a dance?

898
01:11:03,641 --> 01:11:04,699
That's right.

899
01:11:04,876 --> 01:11:06,776
You have any idea
where he was taking you?

900
01:11:06,945 --> 01:11:10,244
No, it was a complete surprise.
I was furious at first.

901
01:11:10,415 --> 01:11:12,007
Then it struck me as rather funny.

902
01:11:12,183 --> 01:11:14,743
When we went back to the plane
and saw it was damaged...

903
01:11:14,919 --> 01:11:17,353
...and realized we couldn't get back,
I was frantic.

904
01:11:17,522 --> 01:11:19,183
Thank you very much. That'll be all.

905
01:11:19,357 --> 01:11:21,848
- Well, what about Larry?
- We'll take care of him.

906
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:25,861
- May I take her back to the plane now?
- Yes. I'll join you in a moment.

907
01:11:27,132 --> 01:11:30,158
You men know this island.
Find Lieutenant Kingslee and arrest him.

908
01:11:30,335 --> 01:11:32,428
- I'll send another plane to pick you up.
- Aye.

909
01:11:32,604 --> 01:11:33,832
Come on, Mr. Buckley.

910
01:11:34,005 --> 01:11:37,133
If you don't mind,
could I go along with the boys?

911
01:11:37,308 --> 01:11:38,605
It's all right with me.

912
01:11:38,777 --> 01:11:42,178
All right, but be sure to keep up with us.
This jungle's pretty tricky.

913
01:11:42,347 --> 01:11:45,475
If we should get separated,
just bear north.

914
01:12:06,838 --> 01:12:10,274
I bet I could trace you
back to my family tree.

915
01:12:14,979 --> 01:12:16,276
Navy.

916
01:12:18,183 --> 01:12:19,912
Navy!

917
01:12:20,251 --> 01:12:22,185
Navy!

918
01:12:22,587 --> 01:12:25,055
Navy! Navy!

919
01:12:25,223 --> 01:12:26,690
"Bear north," they said.

920
01:12:26,858 --> 01:12:29,691
North. Of course,
they didn't tell me where north is.

921
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:35,193
Wait a minute.
When you got trees, you got moss.

922
01:12:35,366 --> 01:12:39,029
And moss always grows
on the north side of a tree.

923
01:12:39,204 --> 01:12:42,139
How do you like that? No moss.

924
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,040
Maybe it's the altitude.

925
01:13:22,347 --> 01:13:26,511
Oh, no. Larry, coz.

926
01:13:26,684 --> 01:13:29,118
I'm too late. Poor coz.

927
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,928
- Hi.
- You hungry?

928
01:13:38,096 --> 01:13:40,291
Not me. I just lost my appetite.

929
01:13:40,465 --> 01:13:42,228
We hungry.

930
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,891
You wouldn't like me. I'm all muscle.

931
01:13:45,069 --> 01:13:47,629
When we hungry, we eat.

932
01:13:47,805 --> 01:13:50,273
That's what's worrying me.

933
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:04,318
Larry! Coz!

934
01:14:04,489 --> 01:14:06,116
Buckley!

935
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:10,389
- Coz.
- Gosh, it's good to see you. How are you?

936
01:14:10,562 --> 01:14:12,860
Chief, friend. Friend.

937
01:14:15,466 --> 01:14:18,435
Coz, am I glad to see you.
I didn't know what happened to you.

938
01:14:18,603 --> 01:14:21,197
Thought they cut you up
and was serving you under glass.

939
01:14:21,372 --> 01:14:24,136
- How did you get here?
- Never mind. What are you doing here?

940
01:14:24,309 --> 01:14:28,040
Trying to get parts back. Chief wouldn't
give my compass till I feasted with him.

941
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:31,011
Oh, they're killing me with kindness.
How'd you ever find me?

942
01:14:31,182 --> 01:14:33,980
I flew in with the Navy.
From there on, I followed my nose.

943
01:14:34,152 --> 01:14:36,677
That took me halfway.

944
01:14:36,854 --> 01:14:38,446
Did you see Roz? Is she all right?

945
01:14:38,623 --> 01:14:41,183
Of course she's all right.
She flew back with the Navy.

946
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:42,792
Did she leave a message for me?

947
01:14:42,961 --> 01:14:45,589
Anything she had to say,
she said to the commander.

948
01:14:45,763 --> 01:14:47,321
The commander?

949
01:14:47,498 --> 01:14:51,025
- Well, she wouldn't just leave without...
- No. She wouldn't just leave.

950
01:14:51,202 --> 01:14:52,499
She loves it here.

951
01:14:52,670 --> 01:14:55,537
She just went back to the hotel
to get her pressure cooker.

952
01:14:56,975 --> 01:14:59,808
Give us a little smile, folks.
Let's make it look good.

953
01:14:59,978 --> 01:15:02,640
- Okay, hold it. Thank you.
- Thank you.

954
01:15:02,814 --> 01:15:06,648
- Had you known this flying Romeo before?
- Yes, I met him once.

955
01:15:06,818 --> 01:15:09,480
Did you have any idea
why he was taking you to the island?

956
01:15:09,654 --> 01:15:11,121
No, it was a complete surprise.

957
01:15:11,289 --> 01:15:13,314
Are you still planning on getting married?

958
01:15:13,491 --> 01:15:14,788
- Of course.
- Of course.

959
01:15:14,959 --> 01:15:18,087
Will Lieutenant Kingslee
still be technical advisor on your picture?

960
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:19,890
Certainly not.

961
01:15:20,064 --> 01:15:23,522
How about another pose?
Something schmaltzy.

962
01:15:24,302 --> 01:15:25,929
Thank you.

963
01:15:26,638 --> 01:15:28,765
- Just one more, folks.
- Oh, no, please.

964
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:30,601
No more now. I'm a little tired.

965
01:15:30,775 --> 01:15:32,743
She's all worn out.
You come back tomorrow.

966
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:34,571
All right. Thank you, Miss Rennolds.

967
01:15:34,746 --> 01:15:35,735
- Thank you.
- Bye.

968
01:15:35,913 --> 01:15:38,108
- You've been swell.
- Bye.

969
01:15:40,385 --> 01:15:42,512
Better get some rest, Roz.

970
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:46,378
- Rick, we need you at rehearsal.
- I'll only be a minute.

971
01:15:54,232 --> 01:15:57,099
Darling, how long have you known
this lieutenant?

972
01:15:57,268 --> 01:15:59,532
I met him several years ago
on one of my tours.

973
01:15:59,704 --> 01:16:03,037
- I didn't even remember.
- Evidently, he did.

974
01:16:03,207 --> 01:16:06,040
Well, that's probably because
I picked him out of the crowd...

975
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:08,405
...to do one of my little routines with me.

976
01:16:08,579 --> 01:16:12,174
Was that the little routine
that wound up with a kiss?

977
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:15,751
- Yes, that's the one.
- I see.

978
01:16:17,188 --> 01:16:20,988
Rick, I assure you that Larry
was a perfect gentleman all of the...

979
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:23,059
So now it's Larry, huh?

980
01:16:23,227 --> 01:16:26,025
Well, after all, there were just
the two of us on the island.

981
01:16:26,197 --> 01:16:29,530
It seemed a little ridiculous
to be so formal.

982
01:16:29,701 --> 01:16:33,000
Please believe me, darling.
I've done nothing that need worry you.

983
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:36,231
I can't say anything more than that, Rick.

984
01:16:42,613 --> 01:16:44,638
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

985
01:16:44,816 --> 01:16:49,116
It's just that American women
are different from the women in my family.

986
01:16:49,287 --> 01:16:51,983
They have more freedom.
They think differently.

987
01:16:52,423 --> 01:16:56,883
Please don't be impatient if sometimes
it's a little difficult for me to accept.

988
01:16:57,695 --> 01:17:01,187
- Am I forgiven?
- Of course, darling.

989
01:17:02,767 --> 01:17:04,860
See you later, darling.

990
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,331
Rosalind,
will you promise me something?

991
01:17:11,509 --> 01:17:12,942
Yes, I'll promise. What is it?

992
01:17:13,344 --> 01:17:16,245
I don't want you ever to see
this lieutenant again.

993
01:17:20,084 --> 01:17:21,108
All right, Rick.

994
01:17:36,134 --> 01:17:37,965
Did my great, big, beautiful Larry...

995
01:17:38,136 --> 01:17:41,333
...really bring little old me out here
for just a teensy dance?

996
01:17:41,506 --> 01:17:44,964
Yes, I did, sweetums,
but I'd like a little kiss too.

997
01:17:45,143 --> 01:17:47,134
Oh, you naughty, naughty boy.

998
01:17:47,311 --> 01:17:50,872
<i>Oh, they spent one whole night</i>
<i>On the island alone</i>

999
01:17:51,048 --> 01:17:54,313
<i>But all they could think of</i>
<i>Was getting back home</i>

1000
01:17:54,485 --> 01:17:57,454
If you guys don't get out of here quick,
I'm gonna murder you.

1001
01:17:57,622 --> 01:17:59,522
Attention.

1002
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:04,293
- Lieutenant Kingslee?
- Yes, sir.

1003
01:18:04,462 --> 01:18:06,896
- Report to Commander Harrisen immediately.
- Aye, sir.

1004
01:18:14,405 --> 01:18:17,897
Now, Larry. Larry.
Take it easy, Larry. Larry.

1005
01:18:24,415 --> 01:18:25,643
Come in.

1006
01:18:32,356 --> 01:18:34,221
Lieutenant Kingslee reporting, sir.

1007
01:18:34,392 --> 01:18:37,190
- I believe you know this lady.
- Hello, Larry.

1008
01:18:40,264 --> 01:18:43,631
- Sit down, Kingslee.
- If you don't mind, sir, I prefer to stand.

1009
01:18:43,801 --> 01:18:46,634
- I said, sit down.
- Yes, sir.

1010
01:18:47,505 --> 01:18:50,269
Miss Rennolds has volunteered
some additional information...

1011
01:18:50,441 --> 01:18:54,377
...which might help your case
and possibly save you from court-martial.

1012
01:18:54,545 --> 01:18:56,911
I take it the lady needs more publicity.

1013
01:18:57,081 --> 01:19:01,484
- I'm surprised to see reporters aren't here.
- Your remarks are out of order.

1014
01:19:02,553 --> 01:19:06,148
Apparently, you're not aware
of the serious charges against you.

1015
01:19:06,324 --> 01:19:08,451
I beg your pardon, sir.

1016
01:19:09,193 --> 01:19:12,458
Miss Rennolds claims that she asked you
to fly her to this island.

1017
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:14,530
- Is that true?
- Of course not.

1018
01:19:14,699 --> 01:19:17,361
I took her entirely against her own will.

1019
01:19:17,702 --> 01:19:19,966
- Miss Rennolds likes her name in print.
- Kingslee.

1020
01:19:20,805 --> 01:19:22,432
I'm sorry, sir.

1021
01:19:22,607 --> 01:19:24,302
You may go on.

1022
01:19:24,475 --> 01:19:25,772
As I told you, commander...

1023
01:19:25,943 --> 01:19:28,707
...I encouraged Lieutenant Kingslee
to fly me to the island.

1024
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,440
I'd been there before
and I wanted to see it again.

1025
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:33,914
I wanted to refresh old memories.

1026
01:19:34,752 --> 01:19:35,741
Is that correct?

1027
01:19:38,322 --> 01:19:41,553
With permission, I'd like to leave.
I don't need Miss Rennolds to lie.

1028
01:19:41,993 --> 01:19:45,087
If it won't inconvenience you too much,
I should like you to stay.

1029
01:19:45,263 --> 01:19:47,788
Won't you please sit down?

1030
01:19:50,434 --> 01:19:53,028
Would you please go on, Miss Rennolds?

1031
01:19:53,471 --> 01:19:57,464
The lieutenant's conduct on the island
was at all times that of a gentleman...

1032
01:19:57,642 --> 01:20:00,440
...although it certainly isn't right now.

1033
01:20:00,611 --> 01:20:04,513
And you say you kissed him
of your own free will?

1034
01:20:06,217 --> 01:20:08,344
Yes, commander, I really kissed him.

1035
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:11,552
- May I leave now, sir?
- You may not.

1036
01:20:14,292 --> 01:20:16,157
What happened after the kiss?

1037
01:20:17,962 --> 01:20:20,897
Larry suggested
we leave the island immediately.

1038
01:20:21,065 --> 01:20:23,795
He did?

1039
01:20:24,201 --> 01:20:26,294
Is that true, lieutenant?

1040
01:20:26,804 --> 01:20:29,967
- Well, I...
- Just answer the question, yes or no.

1041
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:33,673
- Yes, sir, I did.
- I see.

1042
01:20:38,182 --> 01:20:40,616
Miss Rennolds,
when you arrived, you told me...

1043
01:20:40,785 --> 01:20:44,277
...that you were willing to reimburse
the Navy for any damages to the plane.

1044
01:20:44,455 --> 01:20:47,947
- Are you still willing to do that?
- Yes, sir, I am.

1045
01:20:49,193 --> 01:20:52,060
- I see. That's all, Kingslee. You may go.
- Yes, sir.

1046
01:20:56,934 --> 01:21:00,768
Believe me, your performance today was
one of the most magnificent exhibitions...

1047
01:21:00,938 --> 01:21:03,372
...of overwhelming generosity
I have ever witnessed.

1048
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:05,441
It's too bad the cameras weren't turning.

1049
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:09,341
Why, you pigheaded,
obstinate, opinionated hothead.

1050
01:21:09,513 --> 01:21:11,504
If you had as much sense
as you have pride...

1051
01:21:11,682 --> 01:21:16,176
- Go on. You're getting better all the time.
- Obviously, I'm boring you, lieutenant.

1052
01:21:16,354 --> 01:21:19,983
Oh, I hope I never see you again,
because if I do...

1053
01:21:20,157 --> 01:21:22,352
If I do, I'll drown you.

1054
01:21:26,998 --> 01:21:28,226
- Kingslee.
- Yes, sir?

1055
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:30,390
All right, Edward, that's all. You can go.

1056
01:21:30,568 --> 01:21:33,059
- Omit those last speeches from the record.
- Yes, sir.

1057
01:21:33,237 --> 01:21:35,705
Just between you and me,
if I were 20 years younger...

1058
01:21:35,873 --> 01:21:39,001
...l'd plant one healthy punch
right on that stubborn chin of yours.

1059
01:21:39,176 --> 01:21:42,475
- That's all, lieutenant. Shove off.
- Thank you, sir.

1060
01:21:48,219 --> 01:21:50,813
How about a picture, Miss Rennolds?
Smile, please.

1061
01:21:50,988 --> 01:21:52,615
Thank you.

1062
01:21:57,762 --> 01:22:00,094
I've been waiting for you, Roz.

1063
01:22:04,201 --> 01:22:07,170
- I went to see the lieutenant.
- What about your promise?

1064
01:22:07,338 --> 01:22:08,771
It was only right to go down...

1065
01:22:08,939 --> 01:22:11,499
...and try to straighten things out
with his commander.

1066
01:22:11,676 --> 01:22:14,975
- And did you?
- No, the stubborn idiot didn't want my help.

1067
01:22:15,146 --> 01:22:17,580
He insisted on pleading guilty.

1068
01:22:17,748 --> 01:22:19,773
- Well, isn't he?
- Well, in a way he is, but...

1069
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:23,317
And just what did you tell the commander
to convince him otherwise?

1070
01:22:23,487 --> 01:22:24,954
Well, I tried to take the blame.

1071
01:22:25,122 --> 01:22:28,387
I told him that it was my fault,
that I had encouraged Larry.

1072
01:22:28,559 --> 01:22:31,187
In other words, you deliberately lied to...?

1073
01:22:31,962 --> 01:22:33,725
Or perhaps you were telling the truth.

1074
01:22:33,898 --> 01:22:37,595
Of course I wasn't.
I just thought it would help, that's all.

1075
01:22:38,536 --> 01:22:40,697
If you don't mind,
I'd rather not talk about it.

1076
01:22:40,871 --> 01:22:43,169
But I want to talk about it.

1077
01:22:48,212 --> 01:22:50,407
We've known each other
for a long time, Roz.

1078
01:22:50,581 --> 01:22:52,310
Let's be honest.

1079
01:22:53,851 --> 01:22:56,081
- Are you in love with him?
- In love with him?

1080
01:22:56,253 --> 01:22:59,313
I never wanna see him again
as long as I live.

1081
01:22:59,490 --> 01:23:02,118
I see. You never want to see him again.

1082
01:23:02,293 --> 01:23:04,625
And yet you make a fool
and a liar of yourself...

1083
01:23:04,795 --> 01:23:07,491
...over a man who endangered
both your life and reputation.

1084
01:23:07,665 --> 01:23:09,565
He didn't endanger my life.

1085
01:23:09,734 --> 01:23:12,066
Besides, what difference
does my reputation make...

1086
01:23:12,236 --> 01:23:13,931
...when a man's career is at stake?

1087
01:23:14,105 --> 01:23:16,471
Why, the Navy's his whole world.

1088
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:19,541
Haven't you any understanding?

1089
01:23:20,211 --> 01:23:23,874
I think I have.
Perhaps more than you know.

1090
01:23:33,924 --> 01:23:37,360
Yvonne, tell me one thing.

1091
01:23:38,229 --> 01:23:41,687
Is it possible for a woman
to love two men at the same time?

1092
01:23:41,866 --> 01:23:45,131
Well, I don't know, Ricardo.
It all depends.

1093
01:23:45,970 --> 01:23:47,267
On what?

1094
01:23:47,438 --> 01:23:49,133
Well, on...

1095
01:23:49,306 --> 01:23:52,036
- On the woman.
- Could you?

1096
01:23:53,144 --> 01:23:54,611
Of course not.

1097
01:23:54,779 --> 01:23:57,145
There's only one way to love:

1098
01:23:57,314 --> 01:23:58,838
With your whole heart.

1099
01:23:59,016 --> 01:24:01,507
That's the way you would love, isn't it?

1100
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:04,515
Yvonne...

1101
01:24:04,688 --> 01:24:06,883
...isn't it your grandmother Spanish?

1102
01:24:07,057 --> 01:24:08,649
Why, yes, Rick, she is.

1103
01:24:08,826 --> 01:24:10,259
Oh, I knew it.

1104
01:24:10,427 --> 01:24:13,419
I could tell by the way
you feel about things.

1105
01:24:13,864 --> 01:24:15,991
Somehow I sensed it
from the very first moment.

1106
01:24:16,167 --> 01:24:18,931
Come on, Yvonne. Come on, Rick.
We're ready for rehearsal.

1107
01:24:19,103 --> 01:24:22,163
Ricardo, this is after you've been
thrown out of the Navy.

1108
01:24:22,339 --> 01:24:25,399
You're not a lieutenant now,
you're a bum.

1109
01:24:25,576 --> 01:24:28,204
Places, everybody.
Take these out of here.

1110
01:24:28,379 --> 01:24:31,712
- Oh, Mr. Buckley...
- I haven't got the time now. Later. Later.

1111
01:24:31,882 --> 01:24:33,281
Amigo, my friend.

1112
01:24:33,450 --> 01:24:36,112
A million thanks for suggesting Cugat
and his orchestra...

1113
01:24:36,287 --> 01:24:38,084
...to be in your magnificent picture.

1114
01:24:38,255 --> 01:24:39,415
Oh, it was nothing.

1115
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:42,559
All I said was,
"Why not? There ain't nobody else."

1116
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:47,556
To show my gratitude,
I insist you take this gift.

1117
01:24:47,731 --> 01:24:51,258
It's like giving you one of my own family.

1118
01:24:51,435 --> 01:24:57,431
Her name is Francisca Jimenes
Maria Gonzales Conchita. Chita for short.

1119
01:24:57,608 --> 01:25:00,805
I hope you'll be very happy together.

1120
01:25:00,978 --> 01:25:04,436
I don't know about you,
but I'm gonna be miserable.

1121
01:25:04,615 --> 01:25:07,311
Besides, it's gonna complicate
my home life.

1122
01:25:07,484 --> 01:25:09,782
I've got a very vicious canary.

1123
01:28:43,767 --> 01:28:45,928
All right, lights.

1124
01:28:58,182 --> 01:29:01,310
I've never seen them dance
so beautifully together before, have you?

1125
01:29:01,485 --> 01:29:04,682
No, George, I haven't,
and I don't think that I like it.

1126
01:29:08,192 --> 01:29:09,989
Oh, Mr. Buckley.

1127
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:13,687
Not now, honey,
I got business to attend to.

1128
01:29:13,864 --> 01:29:17,265
Wait a minute.
Penelope, how would you like a present?

1129
01:29:17,434 --> 01:29:21,165
A present? But why, sir?
There's no occasion.

1130
01:29:21,338 --> 01:29:25,399
There will be if you accept it.
Look, a bow-wow just for you.

1131
01:29:26,643 --> 01:29:29,669
Oh, he's beautiful.

1132
01:29:29,847 --> 01:29:31,144
So diminutive.

1133
01:29:31,315 --> 01:29:33,306
And he's small too.

1134
01:29:33,484 --> 01:29:38,012
I'd love to take him, Mr. Buckley,
but I couldn't.

1135
01:29:38,188 --> 01:29:39,246
You couldn't?

1136
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:44,093
No, you see, I have a dog at home,
actually, a very faithful dog.

1137
01:29:44,261 --> 01:29:48,027
- I wouldn't dream of hurting his feelings.
- Do you have to tell him?

1138
01:29:48,699 --> 01:29:51,964
Oh, I wouldn't have to tell him,
he'd know.

1139
01:29:52,136 --> 01:29:54,400
Dogs are much smarter than people.

1140
01:29:54,571 --> 01:29:58,029
They sense things.
They're more loyal too.

1141
01:29:58,208 --> 01:30:01,075
You see, dogs love you
when no one else loves you.

1142
01:30:01,245 --> 01:30:05,477
They don't care if you're rich
or smart or pretty or anything.

1143
01:30:05,649 --> 01:30:07,913
Looks like I was designed for dogs.

1144
01:30:08,085 --> 01:30:10,076
Dog is man's best friend.

1145
01:30:10,254 --> 01:30:13,587
And when you have a problem,
he's always there to help.

1146
01:30:13,757 --> 01:30:16,749
I wouldn't dream of taking him
from you, Mr. Buckley.

1147
01:30:16,927 --> 01:30:19,896
But thank you kindly just the same.

1148
01:30:23,467 --> 01:30:25,833
Come on, friend.

1149
01:30:31,875 --> 01:30:35,106
- Anybody home?
- I'll be out in a minute.

1150
01:30:37,915 --> 01:30:41,851
Now, there's a girl who's got a problem,
but can I look to you for help?

1151
01:30:42,019 --> 01:30:45,682
No. Go ahead. Turn your back on me.

1152
01:30:45,856 --> 01:30:48,347
I tried to find a good home
for you, didn't I?

1153
01:30:48,525 --> 01:30:51,551
You see? We don't belong together.

1154
01:30:51,728 --> 01:30:53,787
You're pedigreed and I ain't.

1155
01:30:53,964 --> 01:30:56,956
Besides, I'm not
the proper guardian for you.

1156
01:30:57,134 --> 01:31:00,900
Another thing, first thing I know,
you'll be staying out all hours of the night...

1157
01:31:01,071 --> 01:31:03,767
...and running around
with the wrong kind of dogs.

1158
01:31:03,941 --> 01:31:06,273
And before I know it,
some blond cocker spaniel...

1159
01:31:06,443 --> 01:31:09,435
...will come along and take you
for every bone you got.

1160
01:31:09,613 --> 01:31:11,240
We gotta be big about this.

1161
01:31:11,848 --> 01:31:17,309
You gotta go, so let's just turn our backs
and walk out of each other's lives.

1162
01:31:17,487 --> 01:31:19,387
We won't look back.

1163
01:31:19,556 --> 01:31:21,786
It'll be easier that way.

1164
01:31:27,698 --> 01:31:28,960
Chita.

1165
01:31:31,868 --> 01:31:33,836
<i>Chiquita,</i> I'm sorry.

1166
01:31:34,004 --> 01:31:36,268
I lost my head.

1167
01:31:37,741 --> 01:31:39,641
Hello, Buckley.

1168
01:31:40,310 --> 01:31:42,710
- Cugie gave it to me.
- He's very cute.

1169
01:31:42,879 --> 01:31:45,541
He's not a he. He's a lady.

1170
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:47,675
You've been crying.

1171
01:31:47,851 --> 01:31:49,079
No, I haven't, Buckley.

1172
01:31:49,253 --> 01:31:51,949
Oh, yes, you have,
and I think I know why.

1173
01:31:52,122 --> 01:31:55,250
But don't let it upset you.
Men are always getting crazy notions.

1174
01:31:55,425 --> 01:31:58,292
- It'll all blow over.
- I don't care whether it does or not.

1175
01:31:58,462 --> 01:32:01,158
He's a pigheaded mule
and I hope I never see him again.

1176
01:32:01,331 --> 01:32:03,162
That's gonna be a little hard to work.

1177
01:32:03,333 --> 01:32:05,801
You're doing a swimming scene
with him in the morning.

1178
01:32:05,969 --> 01:32:09,166
Scene? Oh, I'm talking about Larry.

1179
01:32:09,339 --> 01:32:10,772
You are?

1180
01:32:10,941 --> 01:32:12,966
You know, my mother used to say...

1181
01:32:13,143 --> 01:32:16,408
...when a woman runs around hollering
how much she can't stand a guy...

1182
01:32:16,580 --> 01:32:19,014
...it's a sure tip-off she feels
just the opposite.

1183
01:32:20,617 --> 01:32:22,312
What'll I do, Buckley?

1184
01:32:22,486 --> 01:32:24,420
Put on your best hat,
powder your nose...

1185
01:32:24,588 --> 01:32:27,489
...and run straight down
and tell Larry how you feel about him.

1186
01:32:27,658 --> 01:32:31,424
I did go down. I even tried to help him with
the commander and he wouldn't let me.

1187
01:32:31,595 --> 01:32:35,827
You just don't know how mean he was.
He didn't care so much after all.

1188
01:32:35,999 --> 01:32:37,398
Men are funny people, honey.

1189
01:32:37,567 --> 01:32:39,797
Sometimes they want something
till they get it...

1190
01:32:39,970 --> 01:32:43,337
...then they don't want it anymore.
The big heels.

1191
01:32:43,507 --> 01:32:45,031
Where does that leave me?

1192
01:32:45,208 --> 01:32:48,735
Right back where you started,
and that's a pretty good neighborhood.

1193
01:32:48,912 --> 01:32:53,076
Now, you just listen to Buckley,
because he's got information for you.

1194
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:55,946
Did you ever stop to think
it puts 10 lines in your face...

1195
01:32:56,119 --> 01:32:58,610
...when you frown
and only two when you smile?

1196
01:32:58,789 --> 01:33:01,553
When you run into trouble,
there's one thing you gotta do.

1197
01:33:02,025 --> 01:33:05,722
<i>You've gotta start off each day</i>
<i>With a song</i>

1198
01:33:06,797 --> 01:33:09,595
<i>Even when things go wrong</i>

1199
01:33:10,534 --> 01:33:13,526
<i>You'll feel better</i>
<i>You'll even look better</i>

1200
01:33:14,304 --> 01:33:17,705
Oh, Roz, everyone has problems.

1201
01:33:17,874 --> 01:33:20,365
Why, even Chita and I
had a misunderstanding.

1202
01:33:20,544 --> 01:33:25,072
But we made up.
And it's gonna work out to my advantage.

1203
01:33:25,248 --> 01:33:29,412
Now when I make out my income tax,
I'm gonna list Chita as a dependent.

1204
01:33:29,586 --> 01:33:31,554
That will take me out
of the upper bracket.

1205
01:33:32,255 --> 01:33:33,950
That's right, smile.

1206
01:33:34,124 --> 01:33:37,958
<i>Now, isn't it better to go through life</i>
<i>With a smile and a song</i>

1207
01:33:38,128 --> 01:33:41,586
<i>Than walkin' around with a face</i>
<i>Eleven miles long?</i>

1208
01:33:41,765 --> 01:33:45,428
<i>Now, you know that you can't go wrong</i>

1209
01:33:45,602 --> 01:33:48,503
<i>If you start off each day with a song</i>

1210
01:33:50,574 --> 01:33:52,542
That's right, smile.

1211
01:37:57,787 --> 01:38:00,085
Cut it. Print that one, Jane.

1212
01:38:00,523 --> 01:38:02,548
That was wonderful.
Couldn't have been nicer.

1213
01:38:02,726 --> 01:38:03,920
- Thank you.
- Buckley.

1214
01:38:04,094 --> 01:38:07,689
Get the lieutenant and have him check
Rick's uniform before we make this shot.

1215
01:38:07,864 --> 01:38:09,923
Okay, lieutenant.

1216
01:38:18,708 --> 01:38:21,040
- Everything in order, lieutenant?
- Yes, Mr. Montez.

1217
01:38:21,211 --> 01:38:23,406
- Everything's in order. Everything's fine.
- Good.

1218
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:26,879
This is a new experience to me,
working the moving-picture set.

1219
01:38:27,050 --> 01:38:30,178
It's a real pleasure.
And anything I can do, please call on me.

1220
01:38:30,353 --> 01:38:32,719
Thanks, lieutenant.

1221
01:38:33,556 --> 01:38:37,549
Now, Yvonne, when you see Roz
kiss Ricardo in this scene, you're jealous...

1222
01:38:37,727 --> 01:38:41,629
...so you finally decide to go back
to the island. Then, Roz...

1223
01:38:42,365 --> 01:38:43,764
Roz!

1224
01:38:44,801 --> 01:38:46,268
Where's she going?

1225
01:38:47,771 --> 01:38:50,604
She's going in to fix her makeup.
She'll be right back.

1226
01:38:50,774 --> 01:38:53,208
All right, boys, make the setup
for the close shot.

1227
01:38:53,376 --> 01:38:57,540
- Let me know when she's ready.
- Yeah, I'll let you know.

1228
01:39:01,051 --> 01:39:02,848
Come in.

1229
01:39:04,621 --> 01:39:06,851
I wouldn't do that, Roz.
Better get back to work.

1230
01:39:07,023 --> 01:39:08,422
They're waiting for you.

1231
01:39:08,591 --> 01:39:11,389
- Tell them that I... Well, that I just...
- Just what?

1232
01:39:11,561 --> 01:39:13,153
Well, that I just can't work today.

1233
01:39:13,329 --> 01:39:17,595
Oh, come on, Roz. You don't want
someone that don't want you, do you?

1234
01:39:18,468 --> 01:39:21,130
You don't understand, Buckley.
You've never been in love.

1235
01:39:21,638 --> 01:39:24,232
Maybe I have, honey.
But that's all behind me.

1236
01:39:24,407 --> 01:39:26,136
You're just starting your life.

1237
01:39:26,309 --> 01:39:29,335
Believe me, Roz, right now
you think you'll never get over this...

1238
01:39:29,512 --> 01:39:32,675
...and that you can't live
without him, but you will.

1239
01:39:32,849 --> 01:39:36,478
Why, there'll be lots of guys that'll
come into your life, hundreds of them.

1240
01:39:36,653 --> 01:39:39,053
And one of these days,
it's gonna be the right one...

1241
01:39:39,222 --> 01:39:41,190
...and then you'll be glad you waited.

1242
01:39:41,357 --> 01:39:42,915
Are you glad you waited, Buckley?

1243
01:39:43,493 --> 01:39:46,462
Oh, I'm a different case.

1244
01:39:46,629 --> 01:39:50,030
Come on, Roz. Life's too short for tears.

1245
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:52,634
Besides, honey, you've always got me.

1246
01:39:55,972 --> 01:39:59,965
- Tell George I'll be right there.
- That's the girl.

1247
01:40:06,182 --> 01:40:09,811
- Please, Mrs. Peabody, I've got problems.
- Go right ahead, Penelope.

1248
01:40:09,986 --> 01:40:13,547
<i>Something old, something new</i>
<i>Something borrowed, something blue.</i>

1249
01:40:13,723 --> 01:40:15,850
<i>That's what every bride should do.</i>

1250
01:40:16,359 --> 01:40:19,226
How do you like that? Plagiarism.

1251
01:40:19,395 --> 01:40:23,195
Look, honey, go back to the old way.
This way, nobody'll understand you.

1252
01:40:23,366 --> 01:40:27,268
We'll shoot it next Tuesday,
if we're still here.

1253
01:40:27,437 --> 01:40:29,428
Okay, everybody, let's get going.

1254
01:40:29,606 --> 01:40:31,938
Martha, this is the moment
you've been waiting for.

1255
01:40:32,108 --> 01:40:34,542
She's got a curl out of place.

1256
01:40:34,711 --> 01:40:36,008
Roz'll be out in a minute.

1257
01:40:36,179 --> 01:40:37,441
- How is she?
- She's fine.

1258
01:40:37,614 --> 01:40:40,549
Think we ought to stop shooting?
We can get her scenes tomorrow.

1259
01:40:40,717 --> 01:40:44,244
- No, I think it's better if you keep her busy.
- Okay.

1260
01:40:49,492 --> 01:40:50,891
That'll be all for today.

1261
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:54,996
- Very well. Will you want me tomorrow?
- I don't know yet. I'll get in touch with you.

1262
01:40:55,165 --> 01:40:58,100
- Thank you, sir.
- Buckley.

1263
01:40:58,268 --> 01:41:00,395
- Is Larry coming back?
- No, honey, he's not.

1264
01:41:02,172 --> 01:41:04,037
Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I thought that...

1265
01:41:04,207 --> 01:41:07,870
Now, you just go right back to work
and let nature take its course.

1266
01:41:08,044 --> 01:41:10,740
Buckley, I think I should talk with Roz.

1267
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:13,446
Don't worry, honey. Roz understands.

1268
01:41:14,984 --> 01:41:17,885
Just the same,
I wish Larry were coming back.

1269
01:41:25,829 --> 01:41:29,287
I've gotta be gone for a little while
and I want you to take over for me.

1270
01:41:29,465 --> 01:41:33,595
All you gotta do is stay out of the way,
keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.

1271
01:41:34,070 --> 01:41:37,506
If you have to say anything,
just say, "Yes, sir."

1272
01:41:37,674 --> 01:41:38,902
Yes, sir.

1273
01:41:39,075 --> 01:41:41,202
Not that I've ever heard him
say anything else.

1274
01:41:41,377 --> 01:41:44,403
All right, everybody, on your toes.
Light those arcs, men.

1275
01:41:44,581 --> 01:41:47,311
Miss Rennolds, come a-running.
We haven't got all day.

1276
01:41:47,483 --> 01:41:50,975
Yvonne, check your makeup.
Martha! Martha, get Roz out here.

1277
01:41:51,154 --> 01:41:54,817
Janie, vacation's over. Get out your script.
It's about time we got work done.

1278
01:41:55,725 --> 01:41:58,387
You're not gonna get around me
like you do Buckley.

1279
01:41:58,561 --> 01:42:00,893
That's my boy.

1280
01:42:13,309 --> 01:42:16,642
- Nice to have you back, Miss Rennolds.
- Thank you. It's nice to be back.

1281
01:42:16,813 --> 01:42:18,576
I'll bet you won't eat coconuts again.

1282
01:42:18,748 --> 01:42:22,946
All right, shorty, forget the sociabilities.
The soup's in the kitchen.

1283
01:42:23,119 --> 01:42:24,677
Yes, sir.

1284
01:42:25,188 --> 01:42:28,453
Nevertheless, it's nice
to have you back, Miss Rennolds.

1285
01:42:32,695 --> 01:42:35,129
<i>Is a Cuban playboy without much</i> dinero

1286
01:42:35,298 --> 01:42:37,994
<i>He says, "I wanna be good</i>
<i>And I would if I could</i>

1287
01:42:38,167 --> 01:42:39,464
<i>But what can I do?</i>

1288
01:42:39,636 --> 01:42:41,228
<i>I'm just a bad boy"</i>

1289
01:42:41,404 --> 01:42:42,462
<i>Yeah</i>

1290
01:43:13,069 --> 01:43:16,004
- Would you like to dance, George?
- Of course.

1291
01:43:16,572 --> 01:43:19,541
Well, maybe the next one
after the next one, Roz.

1292
01:43:19,709 --> 01:43:21,233
Well, how about you, Buckley?

1293
01:43:21,544 --> 01:43:23,842
Who, me? I can't dance like that.

1294
01:43:24,013 --> 01:43:26,140
My feet don't seem to know
what I got in mind.

1295
01:43:26,316 --> 01:43:29,080
Besides, it makes me seasick.

1296
01:43:29,252 --> 01:43:31,447
But I still loves you.

1297
01:43:34,390 --> 01:43:37,689
Well, what do you know?
I wonder what the Navy's doing here.

1298
01:43:38,294 --> 01:43:40,854
Good evening, commander.
Are you all here?

1299
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:55,607
Looks like the fleet's in.

1300
01:44:08,825 --> 01:44:11,123
Sure a nice-looking bunch of boys.

1301
01:44:11,294 --> 01:44:13,728
Buckley, I was supposed
to forget the Navy, remember?

1302
01:44:13,896 --> 01:44:16,364
The Navy wouldn't forget you,
Miss Rennolds.

1303
01:44:16,532 --> 01:44:20,161
- Good evening, commander.
- Good evening. May I have this dance?

1304
01:44:20,336 --> 01:44:23,396
Remember what happened last time
you refused the Navy.

1305
01:44:23,573 --> 01:44:28,533
I'd love to dance, commander.
Excuse me. I'll see you later.

1306
01:44:36,386 --> 01:44:39,583
Yvonne, do you think your grandmother
will approve of me?

1307
01:45:34,877 --> 01:45:38,313
How do you like that?
I turn my back and he grows up.

1308
01:45:38,481 --> 01:45:41,211
Maybe he needs an assistant.

1309
01:45:45,188 --> 01:45:48,521
- Join us?
- I'd be glad to, if I'm not extruding.

1310
01:45:52,161 --> 01:45:54,857
- May I?
- Certainly.

1311
01:45:55,031 --> 01:45:59,058
- Do you still wanna drown me?
- Yes, I most certainly do.

1312
01:46:01,070 --> 01:46:02,537
Roz.

1313
01:46:02,705 --> 01:46:04,570
Miss Rennolds.

1314
01:46:05,641 --> 01:46:08,041
You're gonna hate me for this,
but I gotta leave you.

1315
01:46:08,211 --> 01:46:09,906
Things don't look so good.

1316
01:46:12,582 --> 01:46:15,642
Roz? Please listen me. I'm sorry.

1317
01:46:15,818 --> 01:46:17,012
I know I made a mistake...

1318
01:46:17,186 --> 01:46:20,383
...but it's so easy to make mistakes
when you love someone so much.

1319
01:46:20,890 --> 01:46:24,553
Oh, now who's being pigheaded
and stubborn and obstinate and a hothead?

1320
01:46:24,727 --> 01:46:28,493
Don't you think it's time you stopped being
an actress and started being a woman?

1321
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,205
Oh, lieutenant.

1322
01:46:42,011 --> 01:46:43,342
Lieutenant?

1323
01:46:44,747 --> 01:46:46,578
Larry?

1324
01:46:47,483 --> 01:46:49,383
