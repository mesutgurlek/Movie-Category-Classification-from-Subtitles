<i>Impressive ceremonies...</i>

Secretary of War Stimson
is blindfolded...

00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:35,866
draws the first number
from 9,000 sealed capsules.

9
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:39,167
Roosevelt:
The first number drawn

- That's no way to drive, Martin.
- Sorry, sir.

16
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,900
The line forms
on the left.

17
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,266
You play
soldier.

18
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,869
Everything seems to be running
smoothly, Captain Johnson.

19
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,879
Yes, sir, we're getting
a fine group of men.

20
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,347
- More teeth and less flat feet.
- That's splendid.

21
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,907
I'll see you later.

22
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,543
<i>- Captain Johnson.
- Yes?</i>

23
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,180
I'm Randolph Parker.
Dad's in Washington now

24
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,689
heading some kind
of defense board.

25
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,386
- I suppose you've heard from him?
- No.

26
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,792
Oh, well I'm sure
you will.

27
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,922
Dad's bound to want
me working with him.

28
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,831
So, about this order
to report for training...

29
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,597
Why of course, Mr. Parker, I understand.

30
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,366
If you'll just
step in here,

31
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,134
we'll be delighted
to take care of you.

32
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,801
Thanks.

33
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,210
You're sure this
won't take long?

34
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,907
Oh no. You'll hang
your hat there please.

35
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,711
Yes.

36
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,446
- And your coat, too.
- My coat?

37
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,454
And the rest of your
clothes please.

38
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,252
<i>- Doctor: Tonsils okay. Open please.

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,460
Tonsils okay.
Next.

<i>- Wide please.
- 175. Next.</i>

42
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:22,425
- Name?
- I'm Robert Martin.

43
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,993
Number 158.

44
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,496
158? Say, that's
a nice number.

45
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,009
Imagine me being
first prize in a raffle.

46
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:35,107
Give a boy a break, Officer.
He's reporting for service.

47
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:38,083
<i>Man: That's the stuff.
That's fine and dandy.</i>

48
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,448
I don't want
to give you any sales talk,

49
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,953
but in my time,
I've advertised tooth powder

50
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,478
face powder, foot powder
and flea powder.

51
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,286
<i>I've lived on the bounty
of the county</i>

52
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,020
<i>and done my boardin'
with the warden.</i>

53
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,426
Never have I ever
had the opportunity

54
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,555
of presenting such
merchandise to the public.

55
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,327
Feel that material. That's
enough. Now, friends,

56
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,824
ordinarily this tie would sell in any
haberdashery for a dollar and a half.

57
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,429
But am I asking you for
a dollar and a half? No.

58
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,531
Am I asking you
for a dollar? No.

59
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,371
Am I asking you
for 50c? No.

60
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,242
All I'm asking for
is 10c.

61
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,747
Now wait a minute. Let me
get a word in... or two.

62
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,045
Go on, go ahead. I'll
listen to you for a while.

63
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,484
Thanks kindly. Neighbor,
how much money have you got?

64
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,646
- I've got in the vicinity of $28.
- You've got $28?

65
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,588
In the vicinity. In the
neighborhood I've got three bucks.

66
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,388
- Then, you've got $3?
- Roughly speaking.

67
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,122
- Roughly speaking?
- When you smooth it out I've got a buck.

68
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,096
Then you have a dollar?
You have a dollar.

69
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,565
That's all I want to know.
The gentleman buys 10 ties.

70
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,500
How can he sell
ties that cheap?

71
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,902
We ain't got no overhead. We haven't
even got a license to sell these ties.

72
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,533
- Feel that material.
- It won't wrinkle or fade.

73
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,976
Fade, Smitty,
fade...

74
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,536
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

75
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,605
The "oper-cay"
is here

76
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,480
The "oper-cay"...

77
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,282
Come here!

78
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,288
Get in the cab.

79
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,451
Hey, cabbie,
step on it.

80
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,926
<i>We're trying
to get away from a cop.</i>

81
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,987
- Cops: Oh yeah?
- Ooh-ooh!

82
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,298
Herbie! Quick,
get in line.

83
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,900
<i>- We'll hide in the movies.
- Yeah, and when we get in we'll stay a long time.</i>

84
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,206
- Get a couple tickets.
- Okay.

85
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,645
- Whoop.
- What are you, a wise guy?

86
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,308
You want to fight?
Take your coat off.

87
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,874
It's much cooler
this way, ain't it?

88
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,647
Go ahead, get a couple of tickets.

89
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,655
What's your hurry? We
got rid of that dumb cop.

90
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,915
- How much to get in?
- Nothing.

91
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,586
We're going
to give you $21.

92
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,290
Oh, bank night.
Giving any dishes away?

93
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,027
- No, tin plates.
- Tin plates, what a novelty.

94
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,364
Now we can start
our new set.

95
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,029
- Step inside.
- Come on or we won't get a seat.

96
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,062
Hey, usher.
Hey, you,

97
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,199
what picture's
playing in here?

98
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,039
- You're in the army now.
- Good, I never saw that picture.

99
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:50,009
<i>Calling Dr. Coldwater.</i>

100
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,017
What's this
"Calling Dr. Coldwater?"

101
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:54,076
- It must be a double feature.
- Ah, yes.

102
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,883
- Draftee?
- Not a bit.

103
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:56,889
- Do you feel it?
- No.

104
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,824
I feel very
comfortable in here.

105
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,326
Right over there.

106
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,057
Let's register before
the drawing starts.

107
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,621
Think you're
gonna win, huh?

108
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,099
Step right up, boys.
Sign right here, please.

109
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,364
- "Please"? What polite ushers.
- Quiet!

110
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,065
And let me have your
signature right there, please.

111
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,631
I'd be delighted.
And I hope I win.

112
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,540
Congratulations, men.

113
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:21,673
- We're glad to have you in the army.
- Both: Thanks. What?!

114
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,739
- Smitty: The army?
- You won.

115
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,546
Gangway!
Mutiny!

116
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:30,179
- Whoop-whoop!
- Going someplace, boys?

117
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,059
Yeah, yes,
we're going someplace.

118
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,028
We're going in the army
and you can't touch us.

119
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,623
Oh, so you're
going in the army, eh?

120
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,566
Well, I'll be
seeing you.

121
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,402
What am I
laughing at?

122
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,849
What are you putting
your tie on for?

123
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,476
Somebody might
come in.

124
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,044
239. You just
made it.

125
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,421
If you'd been over 240, we'd
have had to turn you down. Next.

126
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,289
- Hey, Smitty, did you hear that?
- Yes.

127
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,191
- If you're over 240 Ibs. they don't take you.
- That's right.

128
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:13,460
Boy, am I lucky. Get a
load of this. 241, hm-hmm!

129
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:15,296
Oh, sit down before
you get in trouble.

130
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,801
Get away.

131

136
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,484
Set still. You act as
though you've got a hot foot.

137
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,621
Hot foot? Brother, you've got
a very poor sense of direction.

138

<i>158 and 1/2.

That's you,
Herbie.

142
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,612
Whew.
Okay, Smitty,

143
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,878
have a good time
in the army.

144

241.

145
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,012
It's going
to be okay.

146
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,921
Congratulations, my boy. You're
in the army by two ounces.

147
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,692
Two ounces?!

148
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,824
Double crosser!

and articles of war.</i>

154
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,643
All: And the orders of the officers

155
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,347
appointed over me

156
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,856
according the the rules
and articles of war.

157
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,655
<i>You men will report at the
High Street Armory at 7:00.</i>

158
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,025
<i>We will leave from the
railway station at 9:00.</i>

159
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,654
<i>Until then, dismissed.</i>

160
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,461
I'm gonna go home
to my mama.

161
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,968
Will you get my hat, Martin?
I left it in the other room.

162
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,130
<i>- Mr. Parker.
- Yes?</i>

163
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,298
I've worked for you
for two years, haven't I?

164
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,865
- Yeah, that's right.
- Quite an experience.

165
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,606
I've carried you upstairs and put
you to bed any number of times.

166
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,705
- Why bring that up?
- I got you out of fights

167
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,978
with nightclub waiters and
gambling house bouncers.

168
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,578
- So?
- Remember that night I froze both my ears waiting for you?

169
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,612
And that little accident you had
where I took the rap and went to jail?

170
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,488
Look, Martin,
let's not reminisce.

171
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,015
But we're
in the army now

172
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,119
and I think it's time
I tendered my resignation.

173
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,790
- Very well, tender it.
- Yes, sir.

174
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,498
- What do you think of that?
- That gives me an idea.

175
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,336
- Turn on the heat and get me in the army, will you?
- So what?

176
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,966
- Why...
- No!

177
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,544
Well, what are you
waiting for?

178
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,235
<i>- Detail!
- Detail!</i>

179
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,110
<i>- Halt!
- Halt!</i>

180
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,783
Let the men fall out
until train time.

181
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,309
Yes, sir.

182
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,083
You men can fall out, but
don't go out of this area.

183
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,718
Say your goodbyes and when
I say, "fall in," be here.

184
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,887
Dismissed.

185
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,929
All right, girls,
you can go into action.

186
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,933
Cigarettes,
soldier?

187
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,403
Compliments
of the army.

188
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,407
Everything
all right here?

189
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:45,205
Oh, you look lonesome.
Won't you have an apple?

190
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,212
Cigarettes,
soldier?

191
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,340
Judy Gray, what are
you doing here?

192
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,044
- I joined the army.
- Go on.

193
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,711
Um-hmm. I'm a camp
hostess now.

194
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:54,981
It's something new.
We're going to try

195
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:58,047
to give the boys the feeling
that the camp is their home.

196
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,253
- Add the feminine touch.
- That'll make being drafted a lot more popular.

197
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,056
I think it's pretty popular right now.

198
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,687
- Your cigarettes, sir.
- Thanks.

199
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,062
See you later, Bob. Apples,
compliments of the army.

200
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,795
I'm sorry, sir,
but your mother's in sight.

201
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,598
- Go away. My mother?!
- Yes, sir.

202
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,333
Oh, that's all I need.
Scram, you beautiful things.

203
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,871
Come on, come on.
What is this?

204
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,640
She's coming
this way, sir.

205
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,238
Very good work,
Edmonds.

206
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,273
Fix your face, sir.
Fix your face.

207
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,308
<i>Have an apple, boys?
Cigarettes?</i>

208
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,855
Cigarettes?

209
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,586
<i>Mrs. Parker:
Randolph, my boy.</i>

210
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,256
- Hello, Mother.
- I phoned your father.

211
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,423
- Yeah?
- He'll have you out of this in no time.

212
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,366
<i>- Did he say exactly when?
- Oh, a week at the most.</i>

213
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:45,063
I suppose you'll just have to
make the best of the ordeal.

214
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,833
Pardon my saying so,
Mrs. Parker,

215
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,863
but it won't be an ordeal.
As a matter of fact,

216
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,001
a year in the army can do
a great deal for any man.

217
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,635
Just heaps.

218
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,976
Oh, I can understand how
it may benefit some men...

219
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,107
those who have
no advantages in their homes.

220
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,549
- I know, but...
- But his education and background

221
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,315
should certainly entitle him to
more than these other young men.

222
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:05,152
How can they make
a Yale man a private?

223
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,825
Would you care
for some chewing gum?

224
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,422
Yes, thanks.

225
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,457
- Have you got a lollypop?
- Um-hmm.

226
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,594
You like lollypops?

227
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,103
I'm a sucker
for these things.

228
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:26,439
Gee, she's a nice-looking
messenger boy-girl.

229
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,208
Oh, stop looking
at her.

230
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,979
I was only looking at her to
see if she was looking at me

231
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,574
to see if I was
looking at her.

232
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,381
Remember our
vaudeville days?

233
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,149
You remember
those three little girls

234
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,678
worked with us
on the same bill?

235
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,157
Oh, look over there.

236
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,753
Oh, the Andrews Sisters.
Oh, boy.

237
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:47,163
You're a lucky fellow,
Mr. Smith

238
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,293
To be able to live
as you do

239
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,703
And to have that swell
Miss Liberty Gal

240
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,503
Carrying the torch
for you

241
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,978
You're a lucky fellow,
Mr. Smith

242
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:03,175
Do you know
just how highly you rate

243
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:06,582
You should thank
your lucky stars and I mean

244
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,816
You should thank all 48

245
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:13,120
Man, you've really
got a family tree

246
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,287
With Washington, Jefferson,
Lincoln and Lee

247
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,456
You're lucky to have
ancestors like that

248
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,797
Don't you know you were born
with a feather in your hat?

249
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,497
You're a very,
very wealthy gent

250
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:29,235
I don't care
if you haven't a cent

251
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:32,301
You've got your
American way

252
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,438
And, brother,
that ain't hay

253
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,381
If some poor suckers
could choose

254
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,145
They'd love to be
in your shoes

255
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,120
That proves that your
good fortune's no myth

256
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,715
You're a lucky fellow,
Mr. Smith...

257
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,293
K Company,
fall in!

258
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:55,358
Troops: You're a lucky fellow, Mr. Smith

259
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,666
To be able to live
as you do

260
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:02,765
And to have that swell
Miss Liberty Gal

261
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,368
Carrying the torch
for you

262
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:08,903
You're a lucky fellow,
Mr. Smith

263
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:12,440
Do you know
just how highly you rate?

264
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:15,920
You should thank
your lucky stars and I mean...

265
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:19,516
You should
thank all 48

266
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,992
Man you've really
got a family tree...

267
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,585
Those bags are
too much for you.

268
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,893
- Why don't you get a redcap?
- Why should I get a redcap?

269
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,831
What's the matter with
the hat I've got on?

270
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,767
...ancestors like that

271
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,828
Don't you know you were born
with a feather in your hat...

272
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,320
You're a lucky fellow,
Mr. Smith

273
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,954
You can say that again, yes, ma'am

274
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,089
Can you use
some smokes?

275
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,894
Don't mind
if I do

276
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,663
Charge it
to your Uncle Sam

277
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,637
You're a lucky fellow,
Mr. Smith

278
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:10,403
You should really be
shouting with joy

279
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,842
Yes'm, that's just
what I'm doing

280
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:16,370
'Cause I'm Uncle Sammy's
fair-haired boy

281
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,619
Boys, you're rolling in
a lot of wealth

282
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,450
- Your speech is free
- Yes siree

283
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,423
- And you've got your health
- Sure we've got our health

284
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,254
And tell me why not?

285
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:30,490
Take a look at the great
constitution we've got

286
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,430
Say, this fella
we've been talking to

287
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,491
Might be our president
before he's through

288
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,935
And I mean that all...

289
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,871
All on the square

290
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,374
Well, say now,
I declare

291
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,400
You're blushing
red, white and blue

292
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,036
But, buddy,
that's all right, too

293
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,105
Because those colors
look good on you

294
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,550
You're a lucky fellow,
Mr. Smith

295
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:57,351
You're a lucky fellow
and if suckers could choose

296
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:00,881
They would love to be
in your little shoozies

297
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,588
That proves that
your good fortune's no myth

298
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,622
You're a lucky fellow,
Mr. Smith.

299
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:12,863
Oh, hello.

300
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,032
Hello.

301
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,505
Oh, you need
a light, soldier?

302
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:22,412
Yeah, thanks.
I didn't catch your name.

303
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,507
I didn't throw it.

304
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,912
- Don't go away.
- But I have to, I'm on duty.

305
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,686
A hostess' first duty is
to keep the soldiers happy.

306
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,422
And I will not be happy unless
we get better acquainted.

307
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,327
We have a full year
to become acquainted.

308
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,355
Yeah, but I'll be
out of the army in a week.

309
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,605
What's the matter,
Judy?

310
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,079
Just a fresh recruit

311
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,379
trying out
the manual of arms.

312
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,210
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, Bob, please.

313
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,983
It wasn't anything,
really.

314
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,083
Oh, Judy, we're running out of chewing gum.

315
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,787
Do you have
any to spare?

316
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,488
Yes, Patty.

317
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,429
I'm just telling you
to stay away from her.

318
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,261
I'll pick my own
company, Martin.

319
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,496
Maybe on Park Avenue, but not
in the army. Keep away from Judy!

320
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,367
Judy, eh?
Private stock?

321
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,566
- Why you...
- Mmmm-mmmm.

322
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,734
It's no good, huh?
Excuse me.

323
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,074
- You guys see my pal?
- No, I haven't.

324
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,136
You haven't seen him, huh?

325
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,942
I always did prefer
cinders to cigar smoke.

326
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,851
Do you boys mind if we
share this platform with you?

327
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,321
- No, not at all.
- Come right in.

328
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,682
We'll finish
our dance later?

329
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,523
You've got a date.

330
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,756
Come on and do
your duty.

331
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,031
Wham! There it is,
boys. Seven is a natural.

332
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,799
<i>- Cleaned me.
- Talk about hot dice.</i>

333
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,738
<i>There goes my lesson
for today.</i>

334
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,264
- What are you doing, boys?
- He just gave us a lesson in dice.

335
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:58,867
Dice?
What's dice?

336
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,845
It's a game.
Don't you play games?

337
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,710
Yeah, I play jacks.

338
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,807
<i>- He plays jacks.
- I'm up to my foursies.</i>

339
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,715
Oh, behave.
There's the game.

340
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,652
Will you teach me
how to play that?

341
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,655
Will I teach you
how to play it?

342
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,157
I should say
I will.

343
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,355
Will I teach him? There's
numbers on there from one to six.

344
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,296
Now, you roll 'em out and if
you should roll a one and a six,

345
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,231
that's a seven, that's a natural, you win.

346
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,030
Your roll a five and a two, that's
seven, that's a natural, you win.

347
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,469
You roll a four and a three, that's
seven, that's a natural, you win.

348
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,871
- That's all you do is win?
- Well, no.

349
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:31,341
- Oh, you can lose, too.
- Well, not often.

350
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,436
If you roll a one and a two,
that's craps, you lose.

351
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,880
If your roll two sixes,
that's craps, you lose.

352
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,382
You can win
and you can lose.

353
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,406
- That's it.
- That's fair.

354
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,783
See, seven you win
and craps you lose.

355
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,721
- Let's play.
- You want to play? You roll the dice.

356
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,781
- We play for money?
- Yes. Now how much do you want to bet?

357
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,157
- I'll bet $10.
- That's a good bet.

358
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,094
There you are.
Now good luck to you.

359
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,064
- Seven you win, craps you lose.
- Here I go.

360
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,827
- Go ahead.
- Whee!

361
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,665
Seven.
I win.

362
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,898
Wait, I forgot. Don't pick
up the money right away.

363
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,406
- I do get to pick it up.
- Yeah, sure, it's your money.

364
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,432
- Yeah.
- Yes, yes, yes. You roll 'em again.

365
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,943
How much you
want to bet?

366
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,412
- Fade that.
- "Fade that"?

367
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,915
Wait a minute.
Just a minute.

368
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,076
- Don't get so rough.
- Wait a minute.

369
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,484
- Where did you get that "fade that"?
- Did I say something wrong?

370
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,081
- No, you said it too darn right.
- I'm sorry.

371
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,853
You're sorry? You're sure you
never played this game before?

372
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,561
All right. There you are. Go ahead.

373
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,894
- Same thing?
- Same thing.

374
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,297
- Here I go again.
- Go ahead.

375
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,494
Wheee.

376
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,694
Seven again.
I win.

377
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,572
- Yes, you win again. I guess it's beginner's luck.
- Yeah.

378
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:37,632
What do you
want to bet now?

379
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,076
- Let it ride.
- "Let it ride"? Wait a minute.

380
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,977
- Just a minute.
- Hmmm!

381
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,982
Now, don't tell me you
got that out of thin air!

382
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,984
I heard it
at the clubhouse.

383
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,645
- That's what I thought.
- I must confess.

384
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,745
- Come on!
- Well, there was a bunch of boys in the clubhouse

385
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:53,918
and they had lumps of sugar and they was
throwing them out. I heard the boys say that.

386
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,427
- But you didn't play?
- They wouldn't let me, I was too young.

387
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:59,658
- Oh, that's different.
- Starting Tuesday I'm going out with girls.

388
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,893
I don't blame you.
That's all right.

389
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,060
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

390
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,626
I though you'd
played the game.

391
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,366
- Same thing?
- Same thing.

392
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,532
<i>- Wheew!
- There you are, four.</i>

393
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,906
- A little Joe.
- "Little Joe"?! Now wait a minute!

394
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,911
- Just a minute!
- Clubhouse! Clubhouse!

395
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:16,005
<i>"Clubhouse," yes. You learned a
lot at that clubhouse, didn't you?</i>

396
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,142
Four is your number.
But don't forget,

397
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,516
if you throw a seven before
you make that four you lose.

398
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,282
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

399
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,313
- I start?
- You start.

400
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,724
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

401
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,224
<i>Uh-uh-uh.</i>

402
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:39,527
- I'll be legitimate.
- Yeah, you'd better be.

403
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,129
Wham!

404
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,631
- Clubhouse.
- Um-hmm, clubhouse, eh?

405
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,234
- Three, you lose.
- How come?

406
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,143
- What'd you roll the first time?
- Four.

407
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,704
- What did you just roll?
- Three.

408
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,443
- Four and three is what?
- Seven.

409
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:54,213
Oh, you add 'em up? He didn't
say anything about adding them up.

410
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,847
- Go down to the clubhouse and learn that.
- That's not fair.

411
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,015
- We play my way now.
- I gotta use my money now?

412
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,719
For a change, yes. You've
used mine long enough.

413
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,092
Put it all down.
You don't care, do you?

414
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,222
All right, watch 'em.
Here they go.

415
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,290
- Six
- Six is the point.

416
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,131
Well, boys,
watch this one.

417
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,160
Six again,
you lose.

418
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,604
- No, I win.
- What'd you roll the first time?

419
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,868
- Six.
- What'd you just roll?

420
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:19,968
- Six. - Six and six is 12. Craps,
boxcars, big bennies, hh-hhhh.

421
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,673
Whistle toots:
I'm a bad boy.

422
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,548
Detail, halt!

423
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,641
Take it easy
for a few minutes, boys.

424
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,949
You'll be inoculated
as soon as the jam's over.

425
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,782
Hey, what are we waiting for? Let's go.

426
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,554
- Go ahead.
- Step up, boys, pick yourself a tie.

427
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,390
Hey, get a load
of them, fellas.

428
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,659
10c each, real silk.
Won't rip or tear.

429
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,292
See... Uh-oh. It must be
one of the cheap nickel ones.

430
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,268
- Put that grip away!
- Yes, sir.

431
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,395
- And don't sell any more ties out of that case!
- Yes, sir.

432
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,998
You heard what he said. Don't
sell no more ties out of that case.

433
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,167
- How does he expect us to make a living?
- That's easy.

434
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,871
Come on fellas. I've got ties. 10c each.

435
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,071
Next.

436
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,947
<i>- I don't like this.
- Next.</i>

437
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:35,111
Don't be scared.
The doctor takes a needle.

438
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,018
Like this, it's all over.
Be brave.

439
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,181
<i>Next.</i>

440
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,783
Don't push,
brother.

441
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,919
Hi, shorty.

442
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:47,456
- Next.
- Don't be scared, I'm right behind you.

443
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,295
<i>Ouch!</i>

444
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,699
I hope they're not out
of style when I get out.

445
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:02,510
Here, clean 'em, press 'em, give 'em a
double dose of moth balls and throw them away.

446
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,619
Detail, halt!

447
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:15,558
Right face!

448
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,290
At ease, men.
You may rest your equipment.

449
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,265
I'm Captain Williams, Commanding
Officer of this company

450
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,859
and, men, I'm just as new
to you as you are to me.

451
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,393
But we all have
the same job ahead of us.

452
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,906
And I believe we'll find it
an interesting one.

453
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,273
A great many people are
counting on our success...

454
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,210
people from all
the walks of life

455
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,010
who are contributing to this
great national defense program

456
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,073
just as much
as you or I.

457
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:41,642
I refer
to the factory workers,

458
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:44,314
the farmers,
the citizens

459
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,790
whose taxes are paying
for this training...

460
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:49,316
the people of America.

461
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,989
No one expects you to be
seasoned soldiers overnight,

462
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,157
but we're going to do
everything we can

463
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,928
to help you
in every possible way.

464
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:59,061
And I believe
if we all work together

465
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,596
that we'll make
K company a unit

466
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,666
of which any regiment
can be proud.

467
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,508
- Sergeant Callahan.
- Yes, sir?

468
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,344
- Appoint acting corporals and assign the men to tents.
- Yes, sir.

469
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,543
Sergeant, first seven men...
last tent on your left.

470
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,415
First seven men,
right face!

471
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,354
Next seven men... second
to last tent on your left.

472
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,822
I never knew you made your own bed at home.

473
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,986
I must have forgotten
to tell you.

474
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,890
<i>Man:
Men, the new sarge!</i>

475
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,400
- 21 bucks a month to be a chambermaid.
- Oh, fix it up.

476
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,493
<i>Hello, boys,
I'm Collins, your Sergeant.</i>

477
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:33,868
- Smitty, that voice is very familiar.
- Too familiar.

478
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:37,534
<i>- Who's acting corporal here?
- I am, Sergeant.</i>

479
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,707
Well...

480
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,615
this is going to be
more fun than I expected.

481
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,675
So you gentlemen are
in my section?

482
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,550
Not any more,
we're resigning.

483
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,419
- Herbie, pick up your things.
- Right.

484
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,253
Where are you going?

485
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,758
To collect
my social security.

486
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:58,194
You can't collect your social
security until you're 65.

487
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,061
Seeing you
I aged 35 years.

488
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,623
- Oh, put that down.
Put it... - Uh-oh.

489
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,658
- Well.
- It's a put up job. It's a frame up.

490
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,898
Never saw the stuff
before in all my life.

491
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:10,169
In that case, you'll
never miss this, will you?

492
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,073
- That'll cost you a dollar and a half.
- What?!

493
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,511
- Who said that? Not me.
- Awww.

494
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:17,481
Smitty,

495
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,507
I don't think
he likes me.

496
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,042
Not bad.
Not at all bad.

497
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,612
- Where did you learn to make up a bunk?
- Military school.

498
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,419
Why didn't you tell
the first sergeant?

499
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,255
You might have been made acting corporal.

500
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,989
You can have the whole army. By
Monday I'll be through with it.

501
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,395
Oh, so you're the one
they've been talking about.

502
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,958
- The dude with all the drag, huh?
- That's me, Sarge.

503
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,975
Only singing.

504
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,950
Hey, you with all the drag,
drag yourself over here

505
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,650
and see if you can show these
monkeys how to make up a bunk.

506
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,283
And you two
pay attention.

507
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,123
If you can't stand up
like a soldier,

508
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,992
let's see if you can
learn to sleep like one.

509
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,793
Sergeant, will you
tuck me in bed?

510
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,389
Ahhh!

511
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,295
Get rid
of that thing!

512
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,931
Throw it out!
Understand?!

513
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,534
Well, you heard what the
sergeant said. Throw it out.

514
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,715
Oooh!

515
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,999
Hello, Bob.
Having a little trouble?

516
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,900
Yeah, sort of.

517
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,497
You know, when you want
to write a letter to a girl

518
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,132
how would you
start a love letter?

519
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,268
There's only one way
to write a love letter.

520
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:56,474
Sweetheart,
my own

521
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:59,677
You don't know how

522
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,687
<i>I miss you</i>

523
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,485
Just thought I'd
drop a line

524
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:08,492
And let you know
I'm fine

525
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:11,757
Except I wish
you were here

526
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:17,357
I've been so blue

527
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,302
What I'd give

528
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:22,932
Just to kiss you

529
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,205
It rained
a bit tonight

530
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:29,543
But now the stars
are bright

531
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:33,073
Gee, but I wish
you were here

532
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,421
Each night
when lights are out

533
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:42,222
I make up dreams
about you and me

534
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,690
And like the fairy tales

535
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:50,792
I used to read

536
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:55,329
They all end happily

537
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:59,104
Sweetheart

538
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,339
My own

539
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:04,405
All:
How I long

540
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:09,216
To be with...

541
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:12,121
You

542
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:17,060
I miss you more
each day

543
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:22,499
All:
There's not much else...

544
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:26,061
To say

545
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:29,039
Except

546
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:32,237
I wish you

547
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:35,246
Were here.

548
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,147
Wonderful service.

549
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,384
I got an answer to my letter
before I even wrote it.

550
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:47,914
Army service.

551
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,956
Oh, I get it.

552
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,485
Nothing personal, huh?

553
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,691
I'll let you know
about that one later.

554
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,701
There's one thing you
could tell me right now.

555
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,034
Have you seen any more of my
ex-boss, if you know what I mean?

556
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,733
Uh-huh, I know what you
mean. I haven't seen him.

557
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,674
And I don't
intend to.

558
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,074
You don't know
that man like I do.

559
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,136
He'll be around.

560
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,340
But so will I.

561
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,144
<i>Woman:
Oh, Judy.</i>

562
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,714
You certainly get
the cute ones.

563
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,550
Miss Durling
wants to see you.

564
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,419
Thanks, honey.

565
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,556
Miss Gray, this is
Private Randolph Parker.

566
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,587
How do you do,
Miss Gray?

567
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:29,327
- I'm very anxious to meet you.
- How do you do?

568
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,767
<i>Mr. Parker saw you in
the recreation hall tonight</i>

569
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,703
<i>and asked for
a formal introduction.</i>

570
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,171
Yes, you see
I'm new around here

571
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:37,401
and I don't make friends
very easily.

572
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,138
So I thought if Miss
Durling could spare you,

573
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,169
you might
show me around.

574
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:43,942
You don't know
your way around?

575
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,075
Not in
this neighborhood.

576
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,017
Now run along,
you two.

577
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,576
- Take good care of her, Randolph.
- I'll do my best.

578
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,885
And thank you,
more than you know.

579
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,357
- I had to see you...
- This is the main recreation hall.

580
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:57,225
Soda, soft drinks and ice cream
may be purchased at the fountain

581
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,698
as well as candy, cigarettes,
cigars and razor blades.

582
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,859
- Look, Judy...
- In the reading room you'll find

583
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,300
the latest copies
of all magazines

584
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,895
as well as a carefully
selected library.

585
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,429
The post office is the
first building to the west.

586
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,772
- Which way is west?
- That way.

587
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,540
You go out
this door and turn...

588
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,342
Oh, I'd never
find that.

589
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,474
A Yale man.

590
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,450
There's the post office.
You can see it from here.

591
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,987
How about forgetting what
happened on the train?

592
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,584
What happened
on the train?

593
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,390
It's all your own
fault you know.

594
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:32,919
- My fault?
- Certainly.

595
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,556
Five double malts.

596
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,227
Why don't you order another and
make it and even half a dozen.

597
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:40,101
- I don't want to make a pig out of myself.
- Herbie.

598
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:42,129
Yes, Corporal?

599
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,177
Whoever touches the heads
of those double malts

600
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,011
dies like a dog... unquote.

601
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,775
Ask any man if he'd pass
up a chance to kiss you?

602
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,287
Nonsense.

603
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,586
I'll prove it to you.
Hey, soldier.

604
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,182
- Private Parker?
- Yes?

605
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,285
Captain Williams wants
to see you right away.

606
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,091
- Oh, excuse me.
- That's fine.

607
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:07,222
Maybe he's heard from the
old man. I'd better go.

608
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,199
- Of course.
- Wait here. I'll be right back.

609
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,365
Okay, Corp,
she's all yours.

610
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:13,836
Thanks, pal.

611
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,534
I think you'll find it
on the first shelf.

612
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:19,236
You may not know it,
but you've just been rescued.

613
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:20,710
What do you mean?

614
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:23,236
Captain doesn't want to see
Parker, but I want to see you.

615
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,545
Oh, I get it.
The old army game.

616
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,842
Hiya, neighbor.
How you feeling?

617
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,650
- Not a penny.
- Aw, now come on.

618
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,280
Herbie, did I ask you
for any money?

619
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:33,517
You've got that
look in your eye.

620
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,492
You cleaned me out in
that crap game, didn't you?

621
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:38,461
- You gave me a lesson, that's all I know.
- Do me a favor, loan me $50.

622
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,862
- Smitty, I can't. I can't lend you $50.
- Yes you can.

623
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,733
- No I can't. All I've got is $40.
- Give me the $40 and you owe me 10.

624
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,760
- Okay, I owe you 10.
- That's right.

625
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:48,465
How come
I owe you 10?

626
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,269
- What did I ask you for?
- 50.

627
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,332
- And how much did you give me?
- 40.

628
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:54,072
- So you owe me $10.
- That's right.

629
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,512
- You owe me 40.
- Don't change the subject.

630
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:59,641
I'm not changing the subject.
You're trying to change my finances.

631
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:01,083
Come on.
Give me my $40.

632
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,087
All right,
there's your $40.

633
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,089
- Now give me the $10 you owe me.
- I'm paying you on account.

634
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:07,318
- On account?
- On account I don't know how I owe it to you.

635
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:10,589
If that's the way you feel, it's the
last time I'll ever ask you for $50.

636
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:14,595
Wait a minute, Smitty.
How can I owe you $50 now?

637
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:17,726
- All I have is 30.
- Give me the 30 and you owe me 20.

638
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,896
This is getting worse
all the time.

639
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,530
First I owe him 10,
now I owe him 20.

640
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:23,437
Why do you run yourself into debt?

641
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,374
I'm not running in.
You're pushing me.

642
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,605
I can't help it if you
can't handle your finances.

643
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:30,205
- I do all right with my money.
- And you're doing all right with mine, too.

644
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,580
Wait a minute, I asked you
for $50, you gave me 30.

645
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,142
So you owe me $20 dollars.
20 and 30 is 50.

646
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:37,416
No, no, no.

647
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,923
25 and 25 is 50.

648
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,823
All right,
here's your $30.

649
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,419
Give me back
the 20 you owe me.

650
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,522
Fine guy...
won't loan a pal $50.

651
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:50,090
How can I loan you 50?
All I've got now is 10.

652
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,694
To show you that I'm your
pal, you want to double that?

653
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,637
Go ahead.
See you later.

654
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:57,072
I don't want that kind of
money. On the up and up, hold it.

655
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:59,269
Now take a number. Any
number at all from one to 10.

656
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,834
- Don't tell me.
- I got it.

657
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,641
- Is the number odd or even?
- Even.

658
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,547
- Is the number between one and three?
- No.

659
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,574
- Between three and five?
- No.

660
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,245
I think I got him.

661
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,754
- Between five and seven?
- Yeah.

662
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,779
- Number six.
- Right.

663
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,253
How did he do that?

664
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,195
Mmmmmm!

665
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,012
- See how I rolled that pack?
- Very neatly.

666
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,251
Some of you men have been
getting away with murder.

667
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,191
Brown...

668
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,819
let me see
you do it.

669
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,956
- Ain't this a fine thing for the army to give anybody?
- What's the matter?

670
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:57,195
By the time you get this thing rolled
and packed, you'd be too tired to fight.

671
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,430
- Snap into it, Brown.
- It's mutiny.

672
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:03,031
- How can you be so stupid?
- Oh, that just comes to me natural.

673
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,835
Goodbye, boys,
It's been nice knowing you.

674
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,711
Parker, where do you
think you're going?

675
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:13,046
I just saw my father
drive in, I thought I'd...

676
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,075
Never mind about that.
You stay here

677
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,314
until the instruction
period's over.

678
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,557
All right, Brown,
on his back now.

679
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:22,855
On his back.

680
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,260
No, not you,
you idiot!

681
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:26,854
The pack. Put the pack on his back.

682
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,356
I thought we were going to play piggy-back.
I haven't played since I was a kid.

683
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,164
- You're still a kid.
- I'm playing now.

684
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,034
Come on,
get it on.

685
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,132
You've got more left hands
than an entire company.

686
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,040
- That's good, huh?
- Quiet.

687
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,240
I'll pick it up later, kid.
I'll put it in my own pocket.

688
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,441
- Get up there.
- Give him a hand, Smith.

689
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,143
You know what he said.
Give me a hand.

690
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:47,981
Give him
a hand!

691
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,481
Oh, hello. What are you doing tonight?

692
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:56,323
You imbecile. Get your
silly carcass off of me.

693
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,624
Sergeant Collins.

694
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,654
I'll attend
to you later.

695
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:06,594
- What's cookin', Sarge?
- Get out of here!

696
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,662
Private Parker!

697
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:11,038
Report to brigade
headquarters, immediately.

698
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:13,043
Thanks, Sergeant.

699
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:15,773
Well, boys,
looks like this is it.

700
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,912
All right, Mr. Parker. We'll
try to see things your way.

701
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,182
Private Parker
reporting, sir.

702
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:29,625
- Captain Williams ordered me to report to you.
- At ease.

703
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,184
- Hello, Dad.
- Hello, son.

704
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,720
You're looking better
than your letters intimated.

705
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:36,927
I feel fine, but I thought
you'd forgotten about me.

706
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,765
Your mother didn't
give me a chance.

707
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,703
I came down here
as soon as I could.

708
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,104
Did you fix
everything up?

709
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,110
I had a little difficulty,
but everything's arranged.

710
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,237
That's fine.

711
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:52,443
<i>- Why don't you take a look around while I get out of my uniform?
- I can't.</i>

712
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,110
Why not?

713
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,712
'Cause I have to return
to Washington at once.

714
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:58,949
Because you're not
getting out of that uniform.

715
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,787
Dad, you just said...

716
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,885
That I'd just fixed
everything up. Well, I have.

717
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:06,021
It seems that your father
has a little more respect

718
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:08,725
for army life and army
institutions than you have, Parker.

719
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,633
We were quite ready to cooperate
with the Washington authorities...

720
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,159
But I talked them
out of it.

721
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:16,173
This camp may be short of sport
roadsters and chorus girls,

722
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:19,199
<i>but it's excellently equipped
to make a man out of a playboy.</i>

723
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:21,177
<i>You're going to stay here
the full year...</i>

724
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,407
<i>and like it.</i>

725
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:29,677
I'll be with you

726
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,487
In apple blossom time

727
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,083
Mmm-mmmm

728
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:40,393
I'll be with you

729
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:45,801
To change your name
to mine

730
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:48,532
Maybe one day

731
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:51,337
In May

732
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:56,745
I'll come and say

733
00:36:56,781 --> 00:37:01,115
Happy the bride

734
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:06,249
That the sun
shines on today

735
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:14,596
<i>Andrews Sisters:
What a wonderful wedding</i>

736
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:18,261
There will be

737
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:24,730
What a wonderful day

738
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:27,642
For you and me

739
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:34,044
Church bells will chime

740
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:38,351
You will be mine

741
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:42,155
<i>In apple...</i>

742
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:46,653
<i>Blossom time</i>

743
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,598
I'll be with you

744
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:52,364
In apple blossom time

745
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:55,031
<i>Chorus:
Then what will you do?</i>

746
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:59,839
Then I'll be with you

747
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:03,438
To change your name
to mine

748
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:06,177
Men and women:
When will that be?

749
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:10,381
One day,
maybe in May

750
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,821
Men and women:
Then what will you do?

751
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:18,591
I'll come and say
to you, dear

752
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,597
Happy the bride

753
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:25,933
That the sun
shines on today

754
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,872
Andrews Sisters:
Then what...

755
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:34,071
A wonderful wedding

756
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,011
There will be

757
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:40,143
One day in May

758
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:44,746
What a very very
wonderful day

759
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:49,317
For you and me, dear

760
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,957
Church bells will chime

761
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:58,435
You will be mine

762
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,096
Maxene, LaVerne:
When?

763
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:03,334
In apple...

764
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:09,006
In apple blossom time.

765
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,945
Did I remember to say
thanks for keeping this date?

766
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:19,455
Mere curiosity.

767
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,822
- Curiosity?
- Uh-huh.

768
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,521
Why a certain soldier
decided to stay in the army...

769
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,894
that's gossip item
number one in camp.

770
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:29,263
Maybe he wanted
to be near you.

771
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,927
Of course.
It couldn't be

772
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,528
because the army
might do him some good.

773
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,505
What good?

774
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,099
My dad had some pretty
fair ideas about that.

775
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:40,201
He was a captain
in the fighting 69th.

776
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:42,144
I remember mother
telling me

777
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:44,704
how he always believed that
army life changed boys into men.

778
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,944
He always said it was the great leveler.

779
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,509
It doesn't care how much a man
has in the bank or how little.

780
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:53,216
All the army cares about is
how much of a man a man can be.

781
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,248
You're wasting your breath on him, Judy.

782
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:56,884
The captain wants
to see you at once.

783
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,191
Very funny. Tell him I
can't make it right now.

784
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,527
And on your way,
soldier.

785
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,589
Oh, no, this is as far as I go.

786
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,157
I said on your way!

787
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:06,101
I said this is
as far as I go.

788
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,970
All right, we'll just have to
pretend that you're not here.

789
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:12,134
Now then, Judy, about Sunday. How
do you think we should start our day?

790
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,406
Judy's promised to spend
her day off with me.

791
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:16,310
Why don't we let Judy
decide about that?

792
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:19,214
Martin, did you tell Parker
the captain wanted to see him?

793
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,447
- I did, Sergeant.
- What are you waiting for, an engraved invitation?

794
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:24,147
- I thought he was kidding.
- You get on over there.

795
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,554
Captain's been waiting so long
he's got corns on his hips.

796
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,956
Okay, Sarge.
Goodbye, Judy.

797
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:31,325
- And you, Martin.
- Yes, Sergeant?

798
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:34,422
That bed of yours looks like a
goat's nest. And your pillow...

799
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,797
What have you been doing,
picking a chicken?

800
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:39,803
- I left it in order.
- I suppose somebody else messed it up.

801
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,670
- Somebody did...
- You'll straighten it out. Now get going.

802
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:45,231
- Judy, I'll...
- Get going, soldier.

803
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:50,373
Don't tell me he needs a valet
to keep his things in order.

804
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,848
As a matter of fact,
he's rather neat about it.

805
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:56,046
It took me every bit of 10
minutes to scramble it up.

806
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,981
Say...

807
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,855
by the way,

808
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:03,792
isn't Sunday
your day off?

809
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:06,319
Oh, why, Sergeant?

810
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:11,531
One, two,
three, four.

811
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,696
Detail,
halt!

812
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:16,839
Get back there.

813
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,739
You first four men,

814
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,006
right face!

815
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:23,240
Forward, march!

816
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,550
Detail, halt!

817
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:30,543
Left face!

818
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:33,056
Order arms!

819
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,081
Ohh.

820
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,525
You four men are undoubtedly
the dumbest numbskulls

821
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:40,121
I've ever had the misfortune
of drilling. Private Smith,

822
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:43,565
fall out. Smith, you seem to
know what this is all about.

823
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:44,761
I want you
to take over these men,

824
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,702
drill them for half an
hour and see if you can

825
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:49,331
sweat some sense into them.
I'm exhausted.

826
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,273
The rest of you men,
follow me.

827
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:52,707
Forward, march!

828
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:56,235
Dick, put my gun
in the rack.

829
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,180
Attention!

830
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,043
- Never mind that.
- That's my pal.

831
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:04,748
- Big man, he's a captain.
- Wipe that smile off your face.

832
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:07,382
Wipe it off!

833
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:09,289
- Uhh...
- Quiet!

834
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,351
Quiet!

835
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,192
What are you doing?

836
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,289
- Talking to myself.
- Well, don't talk so loud!

837
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:17,493
- I've got to hear what I've got to say.
- Quiet!

838
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,297
<i>- Count off.
- One...</i>

839
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:19,893
<i>- Two...
- Three, four...</i>

840
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,599
- Bingo!
- You behave yourself! Do you understand?!

841
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,733
I won't warn you again.
Get your chins up!

842
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:27,243
Get your chest out!
Throw out your chest!

843
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:30,008
Get your chest out!
Throw it out!

844
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,641
- I'm not through with it yet.
- Quiet.

845
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,708
Right shoulder,
arms!

846
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,379
- Whoop!
- Come on.

847
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,887
- Pick it up.
- I thought I had it.

848
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:39,219
- Pick it up!
- All right!

849
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:42,191
- Come on, snap into it.
- What's the matter, big man now?

850
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,319
- Quiet!
- Okay, okay.

851
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:47,524
- Order, arms!
- I'll have a cap pistol.

852
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,534
You keep quiet!
I won't warn you again!

853
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,058
- All right.
- All right.

854
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:53,467
- Pick on somebody else.
- Quiet!

855
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,904
Right shoulder,
arms!

856
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,841
I said right shoulder, arms.
That's your left shoulder.

857
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:01,071
- I'm left handed.
- Get it over!

858
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:04,076
It feels better
over here.

859
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:07,982
Get it over there!
Get it over there!

860
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:12,479
Left shoulder, arms.
Right shoulder, arms.

861
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,548
Why don't you
make up your mind?

862
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,059
Get back there.
Come on!

863
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,926
<i>- Right shoulder, arms. Left shoulder, arms...
- Quiet!</i>

864
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:21,227
<i>Do as you're told!
Order arms.</i>

865
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:24,063
<i>- Left shoulder, arms. Left shoulder, arms.
- Quiet!</i>

866
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,729
Present, arms!

867
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,635
Come on,
I don't want it.

868
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:30,230
I don't want it!

869
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,935
- You want it?
- Put it up there?

870
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:35,102
Get it up!

871
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:36,908
<i>Right face!</i>

872
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,676
Come on,
come on.

873
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:40,650
Left face.
Turn with the rest of 'em!

874
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:42,743
That guy hit me!

875
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:46,119
Turn with the rest of them! Pick it up!

876
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:49,784
Right face!

877
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:52,193
Oh, come on!

878
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:54,129
Left face.
Pick up that gun.

879
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,758
Do as you're told. Turn
with the rest of them.

880
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,961
Pick it up!

881
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:04,597
Right face!
Right face!

882
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,543
Forward, march!

883
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,045
Halt! Halt!
Halt!

884
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,445
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

885
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,541
You don't know?
Well, find out.

886
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:15,381
- Now get with it!
- What time?

887
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:18,911
None of your business.
About face!

888
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:21,254
Forward, march!

889
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:24,351
- Hi, fellas.
- Halt! Halt!

890
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:25,987
You guys are going
the wrong way.

891
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,361
Will you get
in line here!

892
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:29,457
I don't know. You got
me in this mess, brother.

893
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,958
Right face.
Forward, march.

894
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,595
Halt!

895
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:36,902
Right face.

896
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,532
Forward, march.

897
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:40,236
Halt!

898
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:42,643
Right face.

899
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,170
Forward march.

900
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,205
Halt!

901
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,150
Get a load of this.

902
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,085
Left, face!

903
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,081
Ah, gently.

904
00:44:57,394 --> 00:45:00,022
Right face!
Right face!

905
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:03,056
Whew! What a time we had with them three.

906
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,534
Forward, march.

907
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:14,210
Herbie: My feet are killing me.

908
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:17,611
Mmmm, and do
these shoes hurt.

909
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:20,549
Well, no wonder. Look
what you've got in them.

910
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:23,109
How do you like that. And I
thought I had fallen arches.

911
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:25,314
- Boy, am I dumb.
- You are dumb.

912
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:27,653
And to prove to you
how dumb you really are,

913
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:29,682
suppose you had $5
in this pants pocket

914
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,059
and $10 in this pants
pocket. What would you have?

915
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:34,291
- The captain's pants on.
- There you are, you see...

916
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:36,561
What are you asking me
those kind of questions for?

917
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,227
- Why don't you ask me a nice easy one?
- All right.

918
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:41,101
- Ask me something about that big.
- Will you answer it?

919
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:43,470
All right,
say you're 40 years old...

920
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:45,532
- Who's 40?
- I mean just suppose...

921
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,874
If I was 40 years old, I wouldn't
be bathing my feet here in the water.

922
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:51,312
I wouldn't be in the army.
After all, I took my uncle's advice.

923
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,839
My uncle told me,
"Herbie, you go in the army. "

924
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:55,374
- What uncle?
- Uncle Sam.

925
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,887
- All right...
- He's my uncle, your uncle.

926
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,889
He's everybody's uncle
in the army.

927
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,050
- I understand.
- He's the only relative I've got.

928
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,060
- I like my Uncle Sam.
- We all do.

929
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,187
Answer this question.
You're 40 years old

930
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,721
and you're in love with a
little girl say 10 years old.

931
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:09,926
This one's going
to be a pip.

932
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,629
- Wait till I finish. - Now I'm
going around with a 10-year-old girl.

933
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:16,730
- Wait a minute.
- You've got a good idea where I'm going to wind up.

934
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:20,039
You're 40 and in love with this
little girl that's 10 years old.

935
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:21,339
Now, you're four times
as old as that girl.

936
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:24,211
- You couldn't marry her.
- Not unless I come from the mountains.

937
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:26,716
- There you go...
- Why don't you ask me...?

938
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,980
Wait till I finish this.
You're 40, she's 10.

939
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:30,953
You're four times
as old as that girl.

940
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:33,047
You couldn't marry her,
so you wait five years.

941
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,615
Now the little girl
is 15, you're 45.

942
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:37,923
You're only three times
as old as that little girl.

943
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,588
So you wait
15 years more.

944
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,461
Now the little girl
is 30, you're 60.

945
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:43,432
You're only twice as old
as that little girl.

946
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,264
- She's catching up.
- Well, yes, yes.

947
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,736
Now here's the question,
how long do you have to wait

948
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:50,001
before you and that little
girl are the same age?

949
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,769
Well?

950
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,800
What kind of question
is that?

951
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:55,778
- Answer the question.
- That's ridiculous.

952
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,611
- What's ridiculous?
- If I keep waiting she'll pass me up.

953
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,584
- What are you talking about?
- She'll wind up older than I am.

954
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:04,178
- Then she'll have to wait for me.
- Why should she wait for you?

955
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:07,850
- I was nice enough to wait for her.
- Aw, go to bed.

956
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:10,485
Girl don't want to marry me,
she don't have to marry me.

957
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:13,018
- That's silliness.
- I like her, I'll marry her.

958
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:15,327
Wait a minute, where are you
putting that water?!

959
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,925
<i>- Throw it out.
- Brown, Smitty...</i>

960
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:29,177
You! You,
I'll strangle you!

961
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:33,206
I'm a bad boy.

962
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:38,020
<i>Man:
Ready, aim...</i>

963
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:41,854
fire.

964
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,926
- Nice shooting.
- Nice shooting, fellas.

965
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,793
Soldier:
Boy, that's swell.

966
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,094
Great shooting, Parker.
Great shooting.

967
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:50,895
Here, keep this
and have it framed.

968
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:53,630
What for? It isn't half as
tough as a round of skeet.

969
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:58,573
It's a shame. He's just
as good as he thinks he is.

970
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:00,600
He's plenty good
with a gun all right.

971
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:02,407
You're not
so bad yourself.

972
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:04,243
<i>Man: Fire!</i>

973
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,909
- How're the men doing, Sergeant?
- First in the regiment.

974
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:09,817
Oh yeah, I've got some
Tennessee boys in my company

975
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:13,152
that can shoot the spots out of
the five of spades at 300 yards.

976
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,817
You call
that shooting?

977
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,587
Why, our boys
at 500 yards

978
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:18,356
can shuffle
a deck of cards

979
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,693
Maybe we can cook up
a five-man match.

980
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,722
<i>Any day.</i>

981
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:25,098
Well, boys,
our fortunes are made.

982
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:27,865
Every dime of this company's money
is on that rifle match tomorrow.

983
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:28,803
Over $500.

984
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:31,273
- Including my buck and a half.
- Including the works.

985
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:34,243
- We're all in but Parker.
- Won't he bet on himself?

986
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:36,508
- Collins said not to tell him.
- Why not?

987
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,537
Well, the sarge figures

988
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,777
that there's not enough
L company money

989
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:42,910
to cover that millionaire's
idea of a small bet.

990
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:45,444
- What odds did you get?
- Herbie's placing the money.

991
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:47,389
- All: Herbie?!
- Don't get excited boys.

992
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,858
With his baby-face,
they'll feel sorry for him.

993
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:52,453
They're apt to give him
five to four or seven to five.

994
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:55,056
Five to four or seven to five?
I got us a real bet.

995
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,157
- You did?
- 10 to one.

996
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,431
10 to one. Certainly, that's the boy...

997
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:04,064
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

998
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,166
Who put up the 10?

999
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:08,109
I did. 10 of ours to one of theirs.

1000
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:09,806
- 10 to one.
- You did?!

1001
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:12,781
Mm-hmm.
What's the matter?

1002
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:14,750
Did I do
something wrong again?

1003
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:27,128
<i>Sergeant: Parker.</i>

1004
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:29,257
How's your trigger finger, my boy?

1005
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,200
I... I haven't made up
my mind yet.

1006
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:37,871
Good afternoon,
ma'am.

1007
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:39,375
You're going
my way?

1008
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:40,842
<i>Hello.</i>

1009
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:42,606
If you're
waiting for Martin,

1010
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,807
he won't be able
to keep his date.

1011
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:46,543
<i>Oh.</i>

1012
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:49,313
- Oh, I see. The captain wanted to see him.
- No.

1013
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:52,151
He's shooting with the
company rifle team. Hear him?

1014
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:53,520
I thought you were
the star of the team.

1015
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:57,425
I was until this morning. Then the
strangest thing happened to my wrist.

1016
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:59,258
I could hardly move it.

1017
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,196
<i>So when I told
Captain Williams about it,</i>

1018
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:03,324
<i>he replaced me with the
sixth man on the score-sheet.</i>

1019
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:06,598
- And Bob was the sixth man, of course.
- Of course.

1020
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:10,573
- How does your wrist feel now?
- What do you think?

1021
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,541
And you walked out
on your rifle team

1022
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:14,567
just to chisel a date
with me, is that it?

1023
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:17,409
You're a lot more attractive
than any target in this camp.

1024
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:18,880
The men you sold out
in your company

1025
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:21,509
bet every cent they had
on the team, on you.

1026
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:23,416
<i>They did?</i>

1027
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:27,523
I didn't know that.
I'll make their losses good.

1028
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:29,889
- With what, money?
- What else?

1029
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:32,019
It's just that easy
for you, isn't it?

1030
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:35,498
I'll tell you one thing, there's no
price tag on loyalty or friendship.

1031
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:38,126
I didn't ask for this uniform.
Why should I take it seriously?

1032
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:40,602
After what you did today,
the only friend you'll have

1033
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:42,662
is the guy who looks
at you out of the mirror.

1034
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,367
And if he had any sense,
he'd stay as far away

1035
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,273
from you
as I'm going to.

1036
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,145
Wait a minute!

1037
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,953
Hello, boys. I'm sorry
we lost the rifle match.

1038
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,156
What do you
mean "we"?

1039
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:10,098
I'll make your losses good if
you'll tell me how much you dropped.

1040
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:13,330
I think I'll take a walk. There's
a strange smell around here.

1041
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:17,362
Wait a minute, boys,
I said I was sorry.

1042
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,704
What do you want me to do,
back flips?

1043
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,006
Yeah, wise guy, and we're
the boys that can flip you.

1044
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:23,808
- Now listen, you...
- Don't you sock him, Henry.

1045
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:29,043
Come on, boy.
Give it to him, Bob.

1046
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,586
Ooh, it's the sergeant.

1047
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:35,318
Move... move it.

1048
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:37,451
It's the sergeant.
Ooh!

1049
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:40,493
- We'll finish this later.
- You mean I will.

1050
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:42,396
Herbie, the light.
The light.

1051
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,162
No, no, no, turn it out.

1052
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:50,132
What kind of a brawl
is going on in here?

1053
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:52,698
Don't you recruits
dummy up on me.

1054
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:57,703
Oh, so it's you, eh?

1055
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:00,614
Yeah, it's me. I wasn't doing
anything. I wasn't doing any fighting.

1056
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,618
I guess that's how
you got that black eye, huh?

1057
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:05,052
Yeah...
I got a black eye?

1058
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:06,555
- Ooh.
- Dry up.

1059
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,854
Keep quiet or you'll
find yourself on KP.

1060
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:11,122
I don't want to hear
another peep out of this tent.

1061
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:13,652
- Douse that light.
- Okay.

1062
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:15,631
It won't go out.
What a life.

1063
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:18,862
What an army and what a
sergeant to have in the army.

1064
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:21,996
Give me liberty or give
me death. That's me.

1065
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:30,837
Who's playing
that radio?!

1066
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:33,509
- Nobody, it's playing by itself.
- Turn it off!

1067
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,040
Be quiet in here.

1068
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:37,781
The men have to get up
at 5:45 in the morning.

1069
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,952
- Go on and play it.
- You heard what the guy said.

1070
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,485
What are you worrying about
him? He's only the sergeant.

1071
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,998
What, are you scared of him?
Play the radio loud.

1072
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:55,200
What did I tell you?!

1073
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:57,900
Didn't I tell you
the men were sleeping?

1074
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:00,603
Didn't I tell you they have to
get up at 5:45 in the morning?!

1075
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:02,612
Well now don't play it!

1076
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:11,485
Go on and play it.

1077
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:14,081
- You're an American citizen, aren't you?
- Hmm.

1078
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:17,685
This is a free country, isn't
it? Go on and play the radio.

1079
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:19,786
If he come in here again,
I'll tell him off.

1080
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:21,990
- You'll tell him?
- You leave it to me.

1081
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,865
Play it.

1082
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,634
<i>- Didn't I say not to play that thing?!
- Yeah.</i>

1083
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:35,543
- Didn't I say the men were sleeping?
- When are you gonna tell him?

1084
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:38,013
- What are you going
to do about it?

1085
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:41,484
- Look here, Brown, I don't like wise guys.
- Sorry.

1086
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:44,783
Next wisecrack out of you, somebody's
going to punch you right in the nose.

1087
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:46,812
I'd like to see
you do it.

1088
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,687
I'll do it all right.

1089
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,489
Why don't you be quiet
like your buddy here?

1090
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:54,759
Now remember, the next
wisecrack out of you,

1091
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:57,164
I'll punch you
right in the nose.

1092
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,191
Yes you will.

1093
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,069
Yes I will!
Yes I will!

1094
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:04,596
When are you
gonna tell him?

1095
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:08,235
Nobody loves me.

1096
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,872
Who's got
a pencil and paper?

1097
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,973
I'm going
to write the President

1098
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:15,041
of the United States
a letter.

1099
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:19,552
- What the matter now, Herbie?
- I'm going to hand in my notice.

1100
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,923
Don't look now,
brother,

1101
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:28,123
but you're
missing a leg.

1102
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:29,859
What are you,
a wise guy or a salesman?

1103
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:31,389
I've been around.

1104
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:40,033
Did I hear a radio
playing in here?

1105
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:43,011
- There's no radio in here.
- Don't let me hear any carousing.

1106
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:43,944
- Yes, ma'am
- What?

1107
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,811
- Yes, sir.
- That's better.

1108
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:49,979
- You've got to be
one or the other.

1109
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:55,080
- Go ahead and play it.
- You heard what the sergeant said.

1110
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,786
Never mind him.
I'll take care of him.

1111
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:57,815
- It's a free country, ain't' it?
- Yes.

1112
00:54:57,861 --> 00:54:59,351
- You an American citizen?
- Yes.

1113
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:02,194
Go ahead and play it.
And loud.

1114
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:04,359
You know...
Wait a minute.

1115
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:06,801
<i>- Take it easy,
I'm on your side.</i>

1116
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:08,667
Please be my friend.

1117
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:10,764
That sergeant
always makes me boil

1118
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,297
I'd like to fry
that guy in oil

1119
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:15,004
No matter what you do
he's always squawkin'

1120
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:16,740
But you just wait
and don't forget

1121
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,270
I'll get to be
a captain yet

1122
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,647
And that's the day
that I'll do all the talkin'

1123
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:24,245
Men: Three cheers for the
red, white, and Captain Brown

1124
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:27,188
Hip, hip, hip, hooray...

1125
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:29,282
My buddies!

1126
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,624
- What did you do?
- I'll scramble it later.

1127
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:36,165
When I become
a captain

1128
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:38,599
The title will be
strictly unofficial

1129
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:40,466
I won't be
highfalutin

1130
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:41,970
Forget about salutin'

1131
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,599
Just step up and call me
by my first initial

1132
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:47,906
Men: Three cheers for the
red, white and Captain B

1133
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:51,436
Hip, hip, hip, hooray!

1134
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:53,676
My buddy!

1135
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:57,148
Snow this time
of the year?

1136
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,018
It's marvelous.
Well, I'll see you later.

1137
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:04,193
When I become
a captain

1138
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:06,661
They'll be no bugle calls
to spoil your slumber

1139
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:09,722
There'll be no KP duties and
we'll draft a bunch of cuties

1140
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:12,735
And instead of doing drills
we'll do the rumba...

1141
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:22,206
What are you doing?!

1142
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:25,544
Men: Three cheers for the
red, white and Captain Brown

1143
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:28,449
Hip, hip, hip,
hooray!

1144
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:30,510
What do you think
is wrong with this army?

1145
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:35,350
I'm glad you asked me
that, my friend,

1146
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,656
and I can tell you
in just two words:

1147
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:39,184
Pa-lenty!

1148
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,288
Get the rest of the boys
down here, I'll tell you.

1149
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,731
Come on,
fellas.

1150
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,100
Now, the way I see it,

1151
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,037
There's too much cold
and too much heat

1152
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,404
Too many MPs walking a beat too
many hikes and too many marches

1153
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:53,306
Too many feet
with fallen arches

1154
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:55,811
Too much water in the soup, too
many pairs of pants that droop

1155
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:58,507
Too many orders, too many drills,
iodine and quinine pills

1156
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:01,415
Too much mud and too much rain
too many aches and too much pain

1157
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:05,649
Too many blisters, too many corns too
many drums and too many horns, whhaaaaa

1158
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:07,155
Too much working
like a slave

1159
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:08,714
Too many spots
that need a shave

1160
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,419
Too many rules
and too much law

1161
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:14,590
Well it's the darndest mess
I ever saw

1162
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:18,067
Three cheers for the red,
white and Captain Brown

1163
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,728
Hip, hip,
hip, hip

1164
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,236
Hooray.

1165
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,068
So you want to be
a captain, huh?

1166
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,404
Well, I've had a talk
with the general about you

1167
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,467
and we've decided
to make you an admiral.

1168
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,910
Admiral?
Ooh, ooh.

1169
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,675
Do they have admirals
in the army?

1170
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:35,172
Sure, we're going to put you
in charge of all the vessels.

1171
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:38,813
Oh, goody.

1172
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:42,154
<i>Three cheers for the red,
white and Captain Brown...</i>

1173
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:42,988
Vessels!

1174
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:45,756
<i>Hip, hip, hip,
hooray!</i>

1175
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:59,770
Hiya, boys.
Good fight, huh?

1176
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,674
There's a couple
of seats over there.

1177
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:03,804
Excuse me.

1178
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:09,184
All: Oh!

1179
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,745
Hello, Judy,
can I see you a minute?

1180
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:14,552
Excuse me.

1181
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,167
Next bout
four rounds!

1182
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:30,604
Private Bill McGuire

1183
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,904
of L Company...

1184
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:37,041
...challenges any man...

1185
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,947
particularly any man
from K company!

1186
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:52,590
Men, are we going to backwater
and let them get away with that?

1187
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:53,960
- Men: No!
- Are we?

1188
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:56,295
- What are you looking at me for?
- Certainly not.

1189
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:58,823
Not after the way those L men
clipped us in that rifle match.

1190
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:02,062
Yeah, that rifle match.
Remember that, boys?

1191
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:05,506
Who's going to stand up and
volunteer for the honor of K Company?

1192
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,908
Somebody over here
should volunteer over there.

1193
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:10,674
Well, who's going
to stand up and volunteer?

1194
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:13,181
Wow!

1195
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:16,079
That's the proper
company spirit!

1196
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,644
Come on, I've got some trunks
that will fit you perfectly.

1197
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:20,178
I don't want
to fight that guy.

1198
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,747
I ain't even
mad at him.

1199
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:24,385
You mean to say you're scared
of that little guy over there?

1200
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:26,452
I mean to tell you
that I'm...

1201
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:30,496
- Is that the guy I'm going to fight?
- Yeah.

1202
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:32,160
Tell that fella
to stay in the ring.

1203
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:33,259
- He's a pushover.
- Sure.

1204
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:36,500
Boy, I can picture myself now. The place
is crowded, I'm coming down the aisle,

1205
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:38,131
I jump in the ring,
I throw off my robe,

1206
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:39,903
and the whole crowd
lets out a terrific roar.

1207
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:42,070
- What happened?
- I forgot to put on my pants.

1208
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:46,911
Come on.
Come on.

1209
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,277
Okay, boys, okay.

1210
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:53,380
Relax, entertain yourselves

1211
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,391
till Private Brown
gets into his fighting togs.

1212
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:15,134
He was a famous trumpet man
from out Chicago way

1213
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:18,045
He has a boogie style
that no one else could play

1214
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:20,413
He was the top man
at his craft

1215
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,248
But then his number came up
and he was gone with the draft

1216
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:26,221
He's in the army now
a blowin' reveille

1217
01:00:26,255 --> 01:00:29,247
He's the boogie woogie
bugle boy of Company B!

1218
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:32,022
They made him blow a bugle
for his Uncle Sam

1219
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:34,928
It really brought him down
because he couldn't jam

1220
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:37,296
The captain seemed
to understand

1221
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:40,325
Because the next day the cap
went out and drafted a band

1222
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:43,100
And now the company jumps
when he plays reveille

1223
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:46,074
He's the boogie woogie
bugle boy of Company B

1224
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:48,737
A-toot, a-toot-
a-toot-diddelyada-toot

1225
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:51,838
He blows it eight to the bar,
in boogie rhythm

1226
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:54,441
He can't blow a note
unless the bass and guitar

1227
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,679
Is playing with him

1228
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:59,813
He makes the company jump
when he play reveille

1229
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:03,292
He's the boogie woogie
bugle boy of Company B

1230
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:07,353
<i>He was the boogie woogie
bugle boy of Company B</i>

1231
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:11,833
And when he played
boogie woogie bugle

1232
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:14,268
He was busy
as a "bzzz" bee

1233
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:17,329
And when he plays he makes the
company jump eight to the bar

1234
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:20,137
He's the boogie woogie
bugle boy of Company B

1235
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:21,905
Toot-toot-toot,
toot-diddelyada

1236
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:24,674
Toot-toot,
he blows it eight to the bar

1237
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:28,507
He can't blow a note
if the bass and guitar

1238
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:31,247
Isn't with himmmmmm

1239
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:34,279
A-a-a-and the company jumps
when he plays reveille

1240
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:37,383
He's the boogie woogie
bugle boy of Company B

1241
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:40,328
He puts the boys to sleep
with boogie every night

1242
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:43,196
And wakes them up the same
way in the early bright

1243
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:45,666
They clap their hands
and stamp their feet

1244
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,796
Because they know how he plays
when someone gives him a beat

1245
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:51,602
He really breaks it up
when he plays reveille

1246
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:55,372
He's the boogie woogie
bugle boy of Company B

1247
01:01:55,411 --> 01:02:01,111
Da-da-da-da-da

1248
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:04,142
Da-da-da-da-da-da

1249
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:06,451
Da-da-da-da-da

1250
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:08,821
And the company jumps
when he plays reveille

1251
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:12,419
He's the boogie woogie
bugle boy of Company B.

1252
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,416
Take it easy.

1253
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:46,322
Funny how some people never
get wise to themselves.

1254
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:48,830
Hey, what am I,
a yardbird?

1255
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:52,699
Presenting the human buzzsaw
of K Company, Herbie Brown!

1256
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:04,238
I'll take it easy with you, kid,
I won't hurt you.

1257
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:17,090
Thattaboy,
champ.

1258
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:19,828
Oh, ain't it cute?

1259
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:22,990
My heart that belongs
to Herbie.

1260
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:24,829
Now listen, kid,
when you get out there,

1261
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:26,801
give him that old one-three...
one-three.

1262
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:28,428
- What happened to two?
- Two you get.

1263
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,530
Right.
Huh?

1264
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,906
You're too light for him,
so they sent me in.

1265
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:38,209
Gee, thanks.

1266
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:44,377
Thattaboy, champ.

1267
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:46,320
<i>And as referee of this
special event...</i>

1268
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:48,448
Sergeant Collins
of K company!

1269
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,793
All right, boys,
instructions,

1270
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,829
Come back here!

1271
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:08,240
Come on.
What's the matter with you?

1272
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:10,336
Come on.

1273
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:13,740
All right,
you boys know the rules:

1274
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:16,718
no fighting in the clinches, break
clean, and no hitting below the belt.

1275
01:04:16,752 --> 01:04:19,084
- You mean I can't do that?
- No, you can't do that.

1276
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:21,453
- You can't do this with your thumb.
- I can do that?

1277
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,515
That's all right
but you can't do that.

1278
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:26,153
- Back to your corners
and commence fighting.

1279
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,662
I don't want to fight.

1280
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:49,608
Get in there
and fight.

1281
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:51,916
Mix it up.
Where is he?

1282
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:55,548
<i>You can't find me.</i>

1283
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:57,889
Oh! It didn't hurt.

1284
01:04:57,927 --> 01:05:00,395
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine...

1285
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:01,896
Count, count,
count!

1286
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:03,899
All right, mix it up.

1287
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:06,697
Herbie, give him the one-three.
The one-three.

1288
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,931
- Herbie: Huh?
- Okay, break...

1289
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:10,768
One, three,
one, three.

1290
01:05:10,806 --> 01:05:12,501
Two!

1291
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:23,010
- All right, break...
- Ooh, what a pretty picture.

1292
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:25,543
- Oh, you like it?
- Yeah.

1293
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:29,924
- One!
- Come on, count!

1294
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:31,449
- Two.
- I think I can get up.

1295
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:33,758
Three. Shall I get you some water?

1296
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:35,787
- Come on!
- Three and a half.

1297
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:37,526
Three and three
quarters.

1298
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:39,761
Give him a chance.
Give him a chance.

1299
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,429
<i>Come on, now,
mix it, boys.</i>

1300
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:46,737
<i>Herbie, give him
the old shoestring gag.</i>

1301
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,471
Hey, your shoelace
is untied.

1302
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:50,502
Which one?

1303
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:53,972
- Two, four, six...
- Wait a minute!

1304
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:55,745
What's this "two, four,
six, eight, 10"?

1305
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,309
What happened to one,
three, five, seven and nine?

1306
01:05:57,353 --> 01:06:00,754
- I don't like them numbers. They're odd.
- Put 'em in, I like 'em.

1307
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:13,158
Break it up.

1308
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:17,799
You feel all right? You've got
the best of him, haven't ya?

1309
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,899
You'd like to go
20 rounds, wouldn't you?

1310
01:06:19,942 --> 01:06:21,967
I know.

1311
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:23,478
What a lucky guy
that guy is.

1312
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:25,537
The bell
just saved him.

1313
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:28,573
I want you to go out there this
round and just keep wearing him down.

1314
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:31,950
What are you trying to do, make me
look bad in there? Aw, you're a...

1315
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,951
Come here a minute. Look
at him, he's all worn out.

1316
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,963
<i>You're fresh as a daisy.</i>

1317
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:03,848
Shut off
that alarm clock.

1318
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:06,286
All right, you guys.
Come on.

1319
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,390
- Full marching order in 15 minutes.
- Yes, sir.

1320
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:17,831
K Company, full marching
order in 15 minutes!

1321
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,698
K Company present
and accounted for, sir.

1322
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:21,600
- March your company off.
- Yes, sir.

1323
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:24,504
Right shoulder,
ho!

1324
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,008
Right face!

1325
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,341
Forward, ho!

1326
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:41,746
- I'm going to write my congressman about this.
- Yeah, what's the idea?

1327
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:44,123
Quiet, no talking
in the ranks!

1328
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:50,493
Cover!

1329
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:02,308
What'd I have
to join the army for?

1330
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:05,871
- Defend your native soil.
- Well, they don't have to feed it to me.

1331
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:08,543
- What is this all about?
- Looks like a sham battle to me.

1332
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:10,279
- Sham battle?
- Yeah.

1333
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:12,753
I should have
stayed home in bed.

1334
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:14,756
Good morning, ladies and
gentlemen of the radio audience.

1335
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:16,815
This is Mike Frankovitch
speaking to you directly

1336
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:18,451
from the central
observation point

1337
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:20,291
for the most extensive
army maneuvers ever

1338
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:22,729
attempted by the United States
in peacetime.

1339
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,063
Just remember
you're being watched

1340
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,661
by umpires, by staff officers
whose duty it will be

1341
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:29,728
to report on the conduct
of every company.

1342
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,569
Unofficially,
I can tell you

1343
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,734
that the company
receiving the best report

1344
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,869
will be named top company
of this regiment.

1345
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:39,438
How can the umpire figure out the right
answer if we don't really shoot the other guy?

1346
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:41,609
That's easy.
Everybody knows that.

1347
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:43,515
All you do is...
you tell him.

1348
01:08:43,552 --> 01:08:45,315
With a book of rules.

1349
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:47,788
For example, if 10 of
our men of the white army

1350
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:49,620
catch up with 8 men
of the blue army,

1351
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:51,592
we outnumber them,
so we've captured them.

1352
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:53,254
They cut loose
five of their tanks

1353
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:56,196
against one of ours,
our tank is destroyed.

1354
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:59,133
We have a plane that drops a flour
sack... that is supposed to be a bomb.

1355
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:01,193
If it lights on a battery
of field artillery,

1356
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:03,171
the battery is wiped out.
You understand?

1357
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:05,105
Yeah, but how do I know
if I get killed?

1358
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:08,133
The umpire hangs
a sign on you reading,

1359
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:10,407
"This mug is as dead
as he looks. "

1360
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:12,277
You see, that's
the only way they could...

1361
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:16,850
All the latest developments in
mechanized air and land equipment

1362
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:19,013
are being employed
in this extensive maneuver.

1363
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:21,420
<i>Present here to observe
these maneuvers</i>

1364
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:24,255
<i>in addition to commanding
officers of the two opposing armies</i>

1365
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:26,557
<i>are high ranking officials
of the War Department</i>

1366
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:29,894
<i>as well as military observers
from Central and South America.</i>

1367
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:22,483
Take cover over here
on signal, men.

1368
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:24,383
All right, up.

1369
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:36,992
Wait a minute.
Where's Herbie?

1370
01:10:37,032 --> 01:10:39,557
Where's...?

1371
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:41,695
Herbie, how did you
get up in that tree?

1372
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:44,433
How did I get
up in the tree?

1373
01:10:44,473 --> 01:10:47,135
I sat on it
when it was an acorn!

1374
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:48,939
Mmm-mmmm-mmmm.

1375
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:50,570
<i>Mike: Latest reports
from the front indicate</i>

1376
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:53,514
<i>that the blue army is rapidly
approaching the Schuylerton Reservoir</i>

1377
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:56,712
<i>and it appears certain that they
will gain control of that vital spot</i>

1378
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:58,913
<i>and be declared the winner
of these maneuvers.</i>

1379
01:10:58,954 --> 01:11:02,446
Men, three miles
west of here is a blockhouse.

1380
01:11:02,491 --> 01:11:04,755
That's a marker
for the Schuylerton Reservoir.

1381
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:06,624
Our section has been
given the vital job

1382
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:08,653
of getting to that blockhouse
and blowing it up

1383
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:10,995
before it can be surrounded
by the blue army.

1384
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:14,127
We've got orders here to split
up into three patrols of four men.

1385
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:15,761
Each patrol will attempt

1386
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:18,034
to gain the objective
from a different approach.

1387
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:20,200
One must get through
and blow up that blockhouse

1388
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:22,005
before it's captured
by the blue army.

1389
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:24,274
Now the first patrol,
Corporal Martin in charge,

1390
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:26,178
Parker, Smith
and Brown.

1391
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:46,899
Toss up your rifles.

1392
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:51,139
No, come on.
Me, me.

1393
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:53,368
<i>- Stand still.
- Bob: Shake a leg, Smitty.</i>

1394
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:57,778
Wait a minute.
Hold still now.

1395
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:01,305
Lift me up.

1396
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,351
Come here...
nobody.

1397
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:11,825
<i>- Come on.
- Wait for me, will you?</i>

1398
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,365
All right,
come on, fellas.

1399
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:30,170
Martin!

1400
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:32,646
Look out, Smitty.
That's loose rock.

1401
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,171
Climb on up
to the next ledge.

1402
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:48,219
Grab my ankle.

1403
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:51,891
Climb up over me.

1404
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:11,477
Work your way around that
next ledge and go back.

1405
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:14,512
Thanks, fella,
you saved my life.

1406
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,353
You owe me a nickel.

1407
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,485
<i>- You all right?
- Yeah.</i>

1408
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:20,620
Let's go.

1409
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:27,565
Your inexperienced soldiers
have done a fine job

1410
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:29,332
holding out
as long as they did.

1411
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:31,999
They have done splendidly, but
the maneuver isn't lost yet.

1412
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,338
One of our patrols
hasn't been captured

1413
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:38,176
and it's just possible that those
men might reach their objective.

1414
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:46,113
<i>Bob: It looks like we got
here ahead of the blue army.</i>

1415
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:48,020
Yep.

1416
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:51,719
<i>Go on, get down there
and blow up the blockhouse.</i>

1417
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,524
So you can tell Judy how you gave
me a chance to be a hero? Oh no.

1418
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:57,555
It's better than her thinking I
grabbed the glory by outranking you.

1419
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:59,396
Go on, get going.

1420
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:03,371
Look, blue army patrol
heading for the blockhouse.

1421
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:08,066
Give me your pistol,
quick.

1422
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:10,635
- What are you going to do?
- Surround the blues with a whole company.

1423
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:13,079
- What?
- You blow up the blockhouse.

1424
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:15,709
I'll attract their attention
and draw them away.

1425
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:25,985
Why those kid soldiers.

1426
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:28,428
I'll bet not one of them comes
within a mile of that blockhouse.

1427
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,125
Not a chance
with every road covered.

1428
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:32,690
Let's get over there
and hoist blue flags.

1429
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:34,361
<i>What the?</i>

1430
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:38,762
There might be more
of them than us,

1431
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,798
but we've got to get over
there and head them off.

1432
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:42,834
Come on,
up and at 'em.

1433
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:12,333
Well, hello, boys.
Looking for me?

1434
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:39,266
Well, there you are,
Parker.

1435
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:41,269
I've been looking
all over camp for you.

1436
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:43,567
Why aren't you over
with the other fellas?

1437
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:46,631
They seem a bit allergic
to me or hadn't you noticed?

1438
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:49,968
Report to brigade
headquarters, immediately.

1439
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:52,037
Thanks, Sergeant.

1440
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:01,447
Private Parker, sir. Captain
Williams ordered me to report to you.

1441
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:03,651
<i>- At ease.
- Hello, son.</i>

1442
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:05,887
Hello, Dad,
nice seeing you.

1443
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:07,919
General Emerson has
some news for you.

1444
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:10,193
A transfer to the
Officers' Training School.

1445
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,827
- No thank you, sir.
- Don't you want a commission?

1446
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:15,359
I want one
very much, sir,

1447
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:18,498
but I've heard that it's possible
to get an appointment from the ranks.

1448
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,167
Thanks for
the string-pulling, Dad.

1449
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:21,800
I had nothing to do
with this transfer.

1450
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:24,141
That's right. You were
recommended by your colonel

1451
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:26,704
along with other men
who've shown exception ability.

1452
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,640
Thank you, sir.

1453
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:33,951
Hello, Randy,
how're you feeling?

1454
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:36,184
You sure put it
over, pal.

1455
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,592
<i>- Howdy, Randy.
- Hello, Randy Boy.</i>

1456
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:52,469
Nice going,
soldier.

1457
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:53,974
Save me
a dance later.

1458
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:56,000
And remind me to give you my phone number.

1459
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:57,909
Thattaboy,
soldier.

1460
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:49,696
Say, what kind
of beat is that?

1461
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:52,393
Man, that really
spins my hat

1462
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:54,925
Doesn't sound like
boogie woogie

1463
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:57,131
But it's really
got a beat

1464
01:17:57,172 --> 01:18:00,039
Maxene, LaVerne: Seems
to us that it's in four

1465
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:02,669
Let us hear it
just once more

1466
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:05,236
Come on and latch
onto that rhythm

1467
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:08,738
All: 'Cause a solid boy's my meat

1468
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:10,877
Some folks like to hear
eight-beat rhythm

1469
01:18:10,919 --> 01:18:13,319
I don't go
for that stuff no more

1470
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:16,119
Anytime you really want
to send me

1471
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:18,752
Bounce me, brother,
with a solid four

1472
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:21,354
Come on in,
the whole place is jumpin'

1473
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:23,956
Everybody's out
on the floor

1474
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,194
If you want
to keep the rhythm pumpin'

1475
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:28,828
Bounce me, brother,
with a solid four

1476
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:31,771
The boogie woogie
was never like this

1477
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:34,002
We've got a new beat
that no one can miss

1478
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:36,533
If boogie woogie
sent you like I think it did

1479
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:39,342
Four to the bar
will flip your lid

1480
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:42,316
<i>Move the tables
and roll the rug up</i>

1481
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:44,716
<i>Shut the windows
and lock the door</i>

1482
01:18:44,753 --> 01:18:47,347
While I try to dig
the little brown jug up

1483
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:50,017
Bounce me, brother,
with a solid four

1484
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:54,757
Da-da-da-da-
da-da-da-da-da

1485
01:18:54,796 --> 01:18:57,321
Clank, clank,
clank, clank

1486
01:18:57,365 --> 01:19:00,334
The joint is jumping
as it never did before

1487
01:19:00,368 --> 01:19:02,461
Clank, clank, clank

1488
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:05,064
They're saying bounce me,
brother, with a solid four.

1489
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:08,372
<i>The boogie woogie
was never like this</i>

1490
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,571
We've got a new beat
that no one can miss

1491
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:13,445
If boogie woogie sent you
like I think it did

1492
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:16,110
Four to the bar
will flip your lid

1493
01:19:16,151 --> 01:19:18,779
Move the tables
and roll the rug up

1494
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:21,118
Shut the windows
and lock the door

1495
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:23,989
While I try to dig
the little brown jug up

1496
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:26,960
Bounce me, brother,
with a solid four.

1497
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:23,848
- Randy!
- Hello, Randy.

1498
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:26,877
- I'll buy you a soda.
- I'll buy you a man's drink... a double malted.

1499
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:30,016
- I thought you guys were broke.
- Broke? Does this look like we were broke?

1500
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:32,652
We just about busted the blue
army at 10 to one, thanks to you.

1501
01:20:32,694 --> 01:20:34,787
- To me?
- Yes, Bob's told us

1502
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,094
and everybody else
how you won the sham battle.

1503
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:39,157
- Bob told you.
- Yeah.

1504
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:41,692
It's really something, overcoming
the handicap of being a millionaire.

1505
01:20:41,736 --> 01:20:44,170
Gee, I wish I was
handicapped like that.

1506
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:47,198
May I have this dance,
soldier?

1507
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:49,970
What are we waiting for?

1508
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,740
Make way, boys.

1509
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,748
Another handicap.

1510
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:55,113
- Excuse me.
- Hello, boys.

1511
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:56,708
Did I clean out
the blue army?

1512
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:58,651
Did you? What about us? Show him, Herbie.

1513
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,712
Look what I won.

1514
01:21:00,755 --> 01:21:03,451
- Did you ever shoot dice?
- Dice, no.

1515
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:05,254
Shall we
step in here?

1516
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:08,194
I would be glad to accept
your most cordial invitation.

1517
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:10,198
- Come along.
- Clubhouse.

1518
01:21:16,104 --> 01:21:18,004
- No cutting, I'm sorry.
- Who wants to cut?

1519
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:20,633
- The captain wants to see you.
- Oh, not that old gag.

1520
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:23,610
Look, pal, this is my last night in
camp and last dance with our girl.

1521
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:25,738
Now isn't that a coincidence. Mine, too?

1522
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:29,045
- You, too?
- Officers' Training School in the morning.

1523
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:31,848
Oh, that's swell, Bob.
Congratulations.

1524
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,752
And thanks for everything.

1525
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:35,983
- What for?
- Never mind.

1526
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:38,549
- We're going...
- Both: to miss you a lot, Judy

1527
01:21:38,593 --> 01:21:40,527
Oh, no you're not.

1528
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:42,359
Both:
Oh, yes we are.

1529
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:45,423
- All right, you take it.
- I'm going to miss you, Judy.

1530
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:47,332
I don't think so,
because it so happens

1531
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:49,997
that I've been
transferred, too.

1532
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:53,303
Don't tell me that they have hostesses
at the Officers' Training School.

1533
01:21:53,341 --> 01:21:55,366
Now isn't that
a coincidence?

1534
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,344
- We're lucky fellas.
- Mr. Smith.

1535
01:22:32,814 --> 01:22:36,409
You're a lucky fellow,
Mr. Smith

1536
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:39,784
Look around you
and get a good view

1537
01:22:39,821 --> 01:22:43,757
In the shops and stores
and down in the mines

1538
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:46,522
Everybody works
for you

1539
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:50,122
There are farmers
plowing in the soil

1540
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:53,726
And the factories
are running full speed

1541
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:57,295
Just to back you up 100%

1542
01:22:57,339 --> 01:23:01,469
And to follow
where you lead

1543
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:04,376
Wheels are turning
and they're hard at work

1544
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:07,813
The wealthy man,
little man, banker and clerk

1545
01:23:07,849 --> 01:23:11,307
They're punching for you
so you do your part

1546
01:23:11,353 --> 01:23:14,618
All the power they need
is the beat of your heart

1547
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:17,955
We're 130 million strong

1548
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:21,724
And we're sticking with you
right along

1549
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:24,926
This is really
your lucky day

1550
01:23:24,966 --> 01:23:28,333
So, buddy,
what do you say?

1551
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:30,304
All: Just throw your hats to the sky

1552
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:32,101
Up where the stars
and stripes fly

1553
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:35,337
And keep your country
rolling it high

1554
01:23:35,377 --> 01:23:38,972
You're a lucky fellow,
Mr. Smith.
