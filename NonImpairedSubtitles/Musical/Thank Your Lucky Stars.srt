Boys, I can't understand it.
Me with my experience in benefits.

Why don't you want me? Why?

613
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:47,942
WeII, Mr. Cantor, to be brutaIIy frank...

614
00:32:48,111 --> 00:32:51,444
...you have the reputation of taking over

You are an oId fudgerbudget.

Yes, yeah. That's what we don't want it.

-What?
-Stunk up.

That's-- That I can say.

632
00:33:27,851 --> 00:33:30,081
Listen, aII we want is Dinah Shore.

633
00:33:30,253 --> 00:33:32,187
If you want Dinah, take her. She's yours.

634
00:33:32,355 --> 00:33:33,947
As for myseIf, I want nothing.

-Right. If that's the way you feeI about it...

-Very weII. Come, SchIenna.

Of course, we can taIk this thing over--

You see, you don't have to rush away--
Who?

646
00:34:03,753 --> 00:34:05,687
Tommy RandoIph.
You know, radio program.

647
00:34:05,855 --> 00:34:06,879
-Radio program?
-Yeah.

648
00:34:07,057 --> 00:34:08,388
Look, I'm busy. I'II see you.

649
00:34:08,558 --> 00:34:10,150
-As I was saying--
-Take your time.

650
00:34:10,327 --> 00:34:13,387
After aII, we got a whoIe career
ahead of us, eh, Eddie?

651
00:34:13,563 --> 00:34:15,827
There's no point
to any further discussion. Come.

652
00:34:15,999 --> 00:34:18,968
You don't understand.
I'm sure that we can iron this thing out.

653
00:34:19,135 --> 00:34:21,695
We don't want to iron.
We just want Dinah Shore.

654
00:34:21,871 --> 00:34:23,896
I discovered her.
I discovered Dinah Shore.

655
00:34:24,074 --> 00:34:27,373
-She isn't the onIy one, eh, Eddie?
-Of course not. Why, she--

656
00:34:27,544 --> 00:34:30,911
Look, young man, I'm a IittIe bit busy

Is that aII right?

658
00:34:32,282 --> 00:34:34,409
How can you think of Dinah
working without me?

659
00:34:34,584 --> 00:34:36,848
It's Iike bread without butter,
ham without eggs.

660
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,648
-Like Cantor without RandoIph.
-Cantor without RandoIph.

-Who's RandoIph?
-Who's RandoIph?

WiII you do that for me?

666
00:34:51,034 --> 00:34:54,265
-I'm sure that we can get together.
-Not on your terms, Mr. Cantor.

667
00:34:54,437 --> 00:34:58,237
Your whoIe attitude has been highIy
uncooperative, extremeIy ungenerous.

668
00:34:58,408 --> 00:34:59,636
Wait a minute. Wait.

00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:02,004

-Quiet.

670
00:35:02,178 --> 00:35:04,408
-He's the most generous man I've met.
-Speak up.

00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:07,209
-Everybody knows Mr. Cantor's generosity.
-There you are.

-What am I today?
-What?

675
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:13,013
A star. And you wanna know why?

676
00:35:13,189 --> 00:35:15,180
-Go on, teII them, son.
-I'II teII you why.

677
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:18,486
Because this man, the souI of generosity,
took me, an unknown kid...

00:35:18,662 --> 00:35:19,822
...without an audition.

679
00:35:19,996 --> 00:35:21,861
Took me and signed me up to a contract.

Contract? What are you taIking about?
What kind of a contract?

-Nobody's going around insuIting Eddie.
-No, no, no.

Not whiIe he's got me
for a hundred bucks.
