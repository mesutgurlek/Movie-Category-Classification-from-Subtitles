This trifle of a story happened
not very long ago -

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,490
at the beginning of XX century,
in Tanner Street of Kiev.

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,540
So let us make a trip to the past.

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,500
Let the old recall what they might,
and let the young get it right.

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,729
The road to Tanners' goes
across a market

13
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,099
Exactly where the hero
of our story,

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,921
Svirid Petrovich Golokhvosty,
is heading together with his friends.

Here are other characters
of the story:

32
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,650
Sekleta Lemerikha, an apple-seller
and not a least character in the plot.

33
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:04,390
Her helper, her daughter Galia.

34
00:04:04,508 --> 00:04:07,480
And this is Stepan.

35
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:13,490
Here's Martha, a friend of Sekleta's,
an unsurpassed master of bagels.

36
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:19,230
The godmother of Galia's, Ustia,
a faithful servant to folk medicine.

37
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:24,450
Nun Mironia is also
a friend of Sekleta's.

38
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,700
And here's Mr. and Mrs. Serkov
[a twisted dog name]

39
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,999
They are Sekleta's kin and
parents of our female hero.

40
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,390
Their daughter, Pronia,
is now at finishing school.

41
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,309
Before going there, we'll meet
our hero once again.

42
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,430
He's in the middle
of his business day.

43
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:34,629
And this stout officer's going
to lead us right into the school.

44
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:41,950

Here's our Pronia at last.

47
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,782
One, two, three, four.
This is the way to greet your Pa.

48
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:23,550
This is how you bow to bosses
who are high above your husband.

49
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,019
A husband you're yet to get.

50
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:43,280
If a man is under you,
greet him like this.

51
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,990
And feel free with your chambermaid,
to make her afraid of you.

52
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,090
Phimka, here! Phimka, there!
[disparaging Euphemia]

53
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,510
Phimka, shut up! Phimka, get out!

Now you go delicately

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,180
to your dance partner.

57
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,630
Curtsy.

58
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,790
Curtsy.

59
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,530
Curtsy.

60
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,090
- Oaf!
- You are!

61
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,460
- This is our daughter's voice.
- Voice?

62
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,530
- Frog-pecker!
- And you're a frog!

63
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,960
- Viper!
- Pest!

64
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,310
Bitch, bitch!

65
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,350
Here you are!

66
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,790
- What's going on?
- Pick it up!

67
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,770
Quick! Oaf!

68
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,250
- Drive, let's go!
- Frog-pecker!

69
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,590
Have it!

70
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,850
- What, finished?
- Finished!

71
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,110
How come? I've paid for one year,
you should've sat the money out!

72
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:54,630
Not enough for ya that our baby's been
tortured by studies for three months?

73
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,770
- Be silent.
- Shut up, please!

74
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,590
The Serkovs are taking their
precious Pronia from the school.

75
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:17,370
And this Pronia goes with 10,000
of Serkov's roubles. Wow!

76
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:35,770
- Center of gravity of a shape of a body...
- Whose body?

77
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,470
Center of gravity of a shape of a body...

78
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,400
A shape of a body...

79
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,110
You will need this no longer,
anyway.

80
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,550
Funny, sir!

81
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,520
Listen here, Golokhvosty.
[the surname means Naked-Tail]

82
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,870
Golokhvastov, that's my name.
[now it means Vain-Boaster]

83
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,179
- The passport says Golokhvosty.
- Pardonnez, the passport mistakes.

84
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,060
Silence and attention! For your
debts, for your unpaid bills

85
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:05,790
your shop goes sealed up, and
your property goes distrained.

86
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,049
You're rogue! You come not
this bill to pay!

87
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,941
You come 'give again'! Give money!
[heavy German accent]

88
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,320
- U-uh, Schweinerei!
- What, please?

89
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:42,410
Rascal! Robber, thief, bankrupt!
Will I get you to jail!

90
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,810
- No, will I kill you!
- Don't kill me, listen here!

91
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,519
Mr. Serkov gives 20,000 of dowry
with his Pronia.

92
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,259
- Ten.
- So I wanna marry her ladyship.

93
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,319
- Will she want to?
- She will.

94
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,850
Will she like you?

95
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,850
Can anyone not like me? Look here!

96
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:06,220
Having the honour to introduce meself,
Svirid Petrovich Golokhvastov, bodily.

97
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:10,039
Mademoiselle, bon jour!
[then pseudo-French mumbling]

98
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,730
Pardonnez moi! Don't you tear
my heart like oakum or what!

99
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,670
My bosom is a walloping Vesuvius!

100
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,910
Decide on my unfortunate destiny!
I beg your hand on my knees!

101
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:27,569
But this enterprise cannot work
without money, to change the models.
Dressing a new style.

102
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:32,499
Taking the damsel somewhere, and
candies, and a cab, that's a must!

103
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,920
- Serkov's money are as good as
ours... As yours!    - Klugler! [clever]

104
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,560
- Eh?
- Clever boy!

105
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,800
Write a promissory note.
One hundred percent.

[girls are singing a folk song]

107
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,330

- Bon jour.

108
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,239
- Hello!
- My greetings.

109
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,590
Oh, what a suit you have here!

110
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,550
- Made of a foreign fabric.
- Must be expensive!

111
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,190
One hundred. No skimping.
Dress best to be met best.

112
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,910
- Right, best bib and tucker.
- That's right!

113
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,180
Take the trousers.
Must stand firm as a chimney.

114
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,970
Let'em stand a wrong way, and what?
You lose your physiognomy at once.

115
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,760
Now the waistcoat.
Gotta be careful about it, too.

116
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,020
A wrong color, and you're down.
No affinity.

117
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,240
- No af... what?
- A bad parade of complexion.

118
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,840
Your ja-ket is your main model.

119
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,720
No model, no man.

120
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,729
- And the buttons!
- The buttons are German.

121
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,930
- And the fabric!
- The fabric is Scottish.

122
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,720
Great Scott-ish, eh?

123
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,240
Why am I talking to you? Ignorance!

I believe in love at first sight.

So good a girl is not
for so vain a peacock!

Keep your hands off the girl, stranger,

No wonder, all Kiev knows me
all right.

140

And I have seen you, too!

A drama in 2 parts."

152
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,200
I am dying watching romances
like this.

153
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,889
About love that boils like tar!

154
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:55,380
Miss Pronia, isn't it better to
have a romance than watch one?

155
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:01,280
Dare I ask you what idea do you
get about me, if any?

156
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,370
- I am asking you!
- Why would you need to know that?

157
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:08,468
"Another victim..."

158
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:26,110
Again I ask you, Pronia Prokopovna,
what is that idea you hold about me?

159
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,530
Need you ask me such things?

160
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,370
Makes me so confused.

161
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,029
- Mind you, maid I am.
- So you're a maid, and what?

162
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,290
That's nothing,
that's a mere trifle.

163
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,950
- I don't get any ideas at all.
- Don't worry, I get all the ideas.

164
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,339
Don't you know what a shame it is
for an innocent young lady?

165
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,109
But it can be no otherwise.

166
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,579
You have to, all the same.

167
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,220
- Don't speak of love,
it's a shkandalle!
- Miss Pronia...

168
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,520
No, I have to speak of love. 'Cause
I am... like... in love with you!

169
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,490
- So what d'you say?
- Merci for that.

170
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,520
Just here, at night, under the moon...

171
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,050
Don't say, don't say!

172
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,080
It scares me so much to hear that.

173
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:19,770
- My heart is jumping.
- Let it be.

174
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:24,210
Jumpin' is good. My lil' dolly-bird!

175
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,320
Oh no!

176
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:30,950
First you have to propose me.
Come to our place.

177
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,900
- Afraid of your old folks at home.
- What ho! My old folks!

178
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,970
They'll do as I say.

179
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:45,220
"Mommy is a golden-hearted woman"

180
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:49,740
"Daddy is a merchant, quite well-off"

181
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,330
"Their only son is posh like no one"

182
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,330
"Having everything I can dream of"

183
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,160
So, friends.

184
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:06,860
That's when our real life begins!
That's where I have that Pronka!

185
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,420
Let me just jog that old Serkov,
and see easy money

186
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,549
jingle all round! A beautiful life!

187
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:18,330
My razors and my clippers will wing
their way right into the river!

188
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,630
- Colossal!
- World class!

189
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,450
- Sviry, how filthy that Pronka is!
- A toad indeed!

190
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:30,500
I'll get me some good soap,
to wash my lips after her!

191
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:36,380
And I'll have such a sweet candy aside,
one look - and you're in love!

192
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,459
- Hush, my dolly, I won't eat you up!
- Let me go.

193
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,009
Or I'll shout for a constable!

194
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:48,029
Shout! One complain of mine,
and you'll be in the watchhouse!

195
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,199
- What?! Why?
- Because, my chick-chuck,

196
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,729
when I saw you first time up there,
I just...

197
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:56,019
...just been dying since then.
Right in love! You don't believe?

198
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,029
- Let me go!
- Then kill me right here!

199
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,759
- Come on, shoot through my chest!
- Let others shoot if they like.

200
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,179
- I don't need those others.
- Let me go, or I shout, by God!

201
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,599
I don't need those others.

202
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,539
- I'll gild you all over. I'm rich!
- I don't care about gold.

203
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,799
- How's that? Everybody cares.
- Let go of me!

204
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,190
Am I so ugly? Just look!

205
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,470
- A finest model.
- Scarecrow!

206
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,919
- Chick-chuck, give me luck!
- Let me go!

207
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,139
- I'm gonna shout!
- Just love me!

208
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,069
- I'll call people!
- Love me, or I'll strangle myself!

209
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:23,970
Please do.

210
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,249
- What're you doing?
- Chick-chuck!

211
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,410
What are you doing?

212
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,230
Let me go again! Let go!

213
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,710
- Mom!
- You, with a man of worth?

214
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:35,959
Ending up like that!

215
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,359
I don't know him, I swear by God,
he was picking on me, mom!

216
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,270
She doesn't know! As if!
Stand where you are!

217
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,870
Going somewhere, good sir?
You'll have your eyes scratched!

218
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:46,721
Mom, people may hear!

219
00:23:46,722 --> 00:23:48,742
A defender! Go home, quick!

220
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,210
Ah, leaving?

221
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,790
- Leaving, eh? Escaping, eh?
- Pardonnez, madam.

222
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:59,659
- Don't twitch.
- Damned if I can't check this cocky boy!

223
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,299
- Madam, make no scandal, people may see.
- Let them see.

224
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,440
Let them all know and see!

225
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,269
I'm rich, I'll pay money!

226
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:09,239
Look at him! Wanting me to sell
my own daughter for money!

227
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,659
- People!
- Madam, quiet!

228
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,139
- Why were you tempting her?
- Damned if I was.

229
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,379
- You were!
- Damned if I was!

230
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:18,040
You were tempting her,
damned soul, you were!

231
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,029
I saw you huggin' and kissin'.
So you were tempting her!

232
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,590
You were, you were!

233
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:34,950
You can't escape!

234
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,389
- You can't, I won't let you!
- Just don't shout!

235
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,500
I have the right, I will shout!
Help! Murder!..

236
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,369
- Listen here. I have love with your
daughter.     - Get outta here!

237
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:48,179
- I know those tricks of yours, noble rogue.
- I am not noble, I'm a commoner.

238
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,289
- I just have a bit of education on me.
- Not just on.

239
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,469
- Just on, by God!
- Not just on.

240
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,089
- On, just a little!
- You're lying, rascal, not just on! Liar!

241
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:54,839
- No I'm not.
- You are.

242
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,279
I'm not. I'm in love with Galia.

243
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,459
- In love?
- Right.

244
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,769
- Then propose.
- I will.

245
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,400
- Do propose.
- I will.

246
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:03,200
Just... just let me go.

247
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:10,060
Oh no! I'll let you go when you
give an oath. Eat the holy ground.

248
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:13,499
Yeah, but a dog might've made...
So how then?..

249
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,290
- Then let's go make a church oath.
- A church oath?

250
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,620
Swear by Holy Church.

251
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,069
- Speak...
- Ready.

252
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:36,789
- May all the Cave Saints scourge me.
- May all the Cave Saints scourge me.

253
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,399
May I be pinned to the ground by the
great bell of the Cave Monastery.

254
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,249
May I be pinned by the
bell of the Monastery.

255
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,019
- If I lie.
- If I lie.

256
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,330
- Now I believe you.
- Do please.

257
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,479
But, my dear boy, there's nothing
of dowry with my daughter.

258
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,199
What for? I have enough of mine.

259
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,479
- A house in the city, a villa, and
people working. - Then come please.

260
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,750
My cabin is over there,
behind the gully.

261
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,220
- You ask for Lemerikha, and anyone
will show you. Bye then. - Bon jour.

262
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,660
And don't think of escaping.

263
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,990
- No parish's far enough to hide ya.
- Why would I?

264
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,820
Oh my God! A nice scrape.

265
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:19,220
Daddy, mammy, close the shop
and go to the living-room.

266
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,990
- Khimka! Khimka!
- Wha'?

267
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,309
- Don't 'wha' me!
- I'm not whaming, I'm asking.

268
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,339
- Shut up!
- Done.

269
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,279
- Shut up!
- Done.

270
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,119
- Shut up, you fool.
- Khimka's a fool!

271
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,729
- Finish your cleaning quick,
then help me change. - A minute.

272
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:36,880
- Daughter!
- Daughter.

273
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,169
- What is it you called us for?
- Did you?

274
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,070
Here you are.

275
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,059
You my mom, take off this philistine
kerchief and put this cap on.

276
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,829
And you my dad, put on this tie.

277
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,009
- How can we wear those?
- How?..

278
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,140
- That's modern style.
- So...

279
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,880
- My ma and grandma wore such.
- Oh my...

280
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,700
What are you doing to me?

281
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,729
You can't speak like
good people do.

282
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,890
You can't walk either,
and the house's so simple!

283
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,210
- Simple is no sin.
- No sin.

284
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,689
Why then did you have me
taught the noble way?

285
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,380
- We just wanted...
- Silence, then!

286
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,389
I am seeing a noble cavalier today.

287
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,605
- He may even propose.
- Who?

288
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,540
- Mr. Golokhvastov.
- A shaver from behind the ditch?

289
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,259
Not a shaver but a barberian.
An educated man, a learned scholar!

290
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,349
- Is he rich, too?
- You bet he is!

291
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,690
Our girl knows what's good for her.

292
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,399
So you see that everything
is in order.

293
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,670
- Phimka!
- Phimka!

294
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:30,959
- Wha'?
- Run for vodka!

295
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,560
Vodka? Are ye crazy?..
How about onions with it?

296
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,719
- What then, daughter?
- Champaign!

297
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,819
- That expensive thing?
- Stingy, eh? Nothing for your daughter...

298
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,720
Phimka!

299
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,219
- Phimka!
- Wha'?

300
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,340
Run to that vintner.
Damned school...

301
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,089
And you - sit in your room
until I command you to come out.

302
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:54,520
Lest you utter something rustic
in the presence of the cavalier.

303
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:00,020
And pray that boor aunt of mine
doesn't show up!

304
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,450
Good day to you and your home!

305
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:12,689
Wow, been running all day long
to sell all the apples up,
like a hound after a rabbit.

306
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,980
And then I think what if I come
round to see the Serkovs and have
a drink or two.

307
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,420
Giving you the present of a cat,
and some apples to Sirko.

308
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,430
How come you callin' me Sirko?
['grizzly dog']

309
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:31,609
I had a dog named Sirko, then
I kicked it out lest I be called
that filthy name.

310
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,100
I'm no Sirko, I'm Mr.Serkov.

311
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,617
Choose whatever dog name you like.

312
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:43,620
Have a quick drink, sister,
because we're leaving for vespers.

313
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,910
- Yeah, we're in a real hurry.
- Time permits. Good, thank God!

314
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,000
I knew it!

315
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:00,260
- So here's a guest for us, hah?
- That's right.

316
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:04,569
- You've said it, baby darling.
- It is not a visiting day.

317
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:07,030
As good for visits as a day can be.

318
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,630
I've sold all my apples. Let's have
a drink, Prokop Sviridovich!

319
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,570
- This idea makes me...
- Hah!

320
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,630
My God, she's got a follower!

321
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,631
Nice drinking privilege you have
at your own house!

322
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,840
Pa, put it down!

323
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,510
Cheers!

324
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,481
There's no pothouse for ya here.

325
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,909
You know what, Priska. Go to kitchen
and make some tea for your aunt!

326
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,830
You wish, hah!

327
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:47,300
You dare? You dare! Mom! Dad!

328
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,770
My daughter making tea
after her school education?!

329
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,830
Speaking of education...

330
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,099
A couple of days at school as a
gofer is not yet an education.

331
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,379
- What? - Go pamper your Priska,
if you don't yet have enough!

332
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,409
Don't you dare call me that name!
Drill your Galia if you like!

333
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,980
If my daughter camped around
like that, that viper

334
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:08,779
would catch her scolding
all right!       - What?

335
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,349
Then go drill your sprout,
and I've done my drill!

336
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,590
Too little of that.
Got to do a lo-o-ot more.

337
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,030
This is not, dear sister,
the business of yours!

338
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,090
U-uh. Don't you think you fuss
over her a bit too much?

339
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,790
Dad, ask her to leave!
Unwanted guest...

340
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,519
- We, Sekleta Philipovna,
are this way, and you...

341
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,970
- ...are that way.
- Yeah!

342
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:32,910
What way? You think I don't
know the noble family of Serkovs?

343
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,799
Your father was a tanner,
that's how he made his bread.

344
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,279
And I sell apples to make mine,
fearing no one!

345
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,409
- Even your great scholar Priska.
- We don't fear you that much either!

346
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:47,029
- Too short a hand! - Long enough
to catch a nose like yours.

347
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,999
- Mom!
- What about her nose, eh?

348
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,980
Good to peck frogs!

349
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,749
- Your man had a nose like... like...
- Like what?

350
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,840
Oh! Like an open haycock!

351
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:59,299
Hands off my man, you!
He was under no one's thumb.

352
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,179
And he wasn't a boor like yours!

353
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,880
- Dad!
- Who, me a boor?!

354
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,010
- Get her outta here!
- Who?

355
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,079
- Me, Sekleta Lemerikha, outta here?
- Go sell your apples, you!

356
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,800
- And you, protecting that devil!
- Out!

357
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:21,520
Mom! Mom!

358
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:25,270
- Look at these ass-headed!
- Sister!

359
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,920
- I'll patch you up, noble asses!
- Phimka!

360
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,580
- Phimka's a fool!
- Outta here!

361
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,259
- You rag-doll, dare you shout
at your aunt!     - Oh my God.

362
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:42,200
What's wrong with you? This silly doll
has you on the leash like puppies,
and you just clap your lips!

363
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:46,140
- Oh my dear God!
- Out, dirty rustic!

364
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,250
Have it!

365
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,290
To ya!

366
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,380
See, that's your kins.

367
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,640
You shouldn't have.
It's your aunt.

368
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,720
- A sister to your mother.
- Then kiss her... cheeks!

369
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:19,820
I just met Aunt Sekleta, so she
asked me to tell you, Miss Pronia,

370
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:23,420
that you're a bitch.
- Stupid wench!

371
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:28,550
- And there's a mister at the gate,
asking for ya. - It's him!

372
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,710
Stop fooling around, you slowpokes!

373
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:43,590
Finish cleaning, quick! Mom,
put the cap on. Dad, your tie!

374
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,570
- Khimka! Khimka!
- Wha'?

375
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:52,949
Cense in the house to kill the
vodka smell, and heat up champaign!

376
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:53,899
- Dad!
- Ha?

377
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,980
There's a head under the table!

378
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,030
Damned school!

379
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,110
Khimka!

380
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,910
- Khimka!
- Wha'?

381
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,009
Chimeon, lace me in!
[a stupid pretence of a name]

382
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,350
Come on!

383
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,440
Faster! Pull tighter!

384
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,940
The book! Where's my book?!

385
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,420
Where's the book?

386
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,140
- Why are you sitting here?
- Feelin' weary.

387
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,150
Put the chair here
and fetch the sofa!

388
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,769
The book? Where is it?

389
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:42,010
- You gave it for kitchen needs.
- You're killing me!

390
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,170
Khimka! Khimka! Khimka!

391
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,819
- Wha'?
- Don't "wha", I told you to hide!

392
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,650
- Wha'?
- Don't "wha" me!

393
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,799
- I'm not.
- Shut up!

394
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,809
- Shut up!
- Done.

395
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,539
- Go bring the hide.
- The hide of what?

396
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,760
Father's hide. Stop!
Fetch the shipskin.

397
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,100
How to pose for the cavalier?

398
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,440
Standing.

399
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:10,550
Sitting.

400
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,800
Lying.

401
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,671
Make a bear!

402
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:27,440
- Chimeon, be so kind!
- What kind?

403
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,970
- Call that man, viper!
- So speak like a Christian!

404
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,967
My miss is on the bed
begging you to enter.

405
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,430
My veneration to this house's
population.

406
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:00,990
But before all the others

407
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,800
to you, my Pronia Prokopovna.
- Phimka's a fool!

408
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:18,640
I'm burning! Flaming with happiness...

409
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:23,510
...and things like that,
that I can see you on your own sofa!

410
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:30,840
Ah! Is it you? Bonjour.

411
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,480
I hardly saw you, the book's so
exciting. Merci for coming.

412
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,955
Dear mom! Dear dad! Come in,
Mr.Golokhvastov is so kind to visit.

413
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,098
Let me introduce,
these are my parents.

414
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:57,050
Having the honour of introducing meself,
Svirid Petrovich Golokhvastov, bodily.

415
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,350
May I have your hand.

416
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,359
Again having the honour of introducing
meself, Svirid Petrovich Golokhvastov,

417
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,680
- Bodily.
- Very glad to see a man of wits.

418
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:14,330
- Please be seated.
- Please, monsieur.

419
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:20,810
Sit down, too.

420
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,240
If I dare ask.

421
00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:00,710
Are you a son of the late Petro
Golokhvosty [Naked-Tail]

422
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:05,070
who was a shaver behind the ditch?
- Daddy!

423
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:11,490
Their surname is Golokhvastov [Vain-Boaster],
you speaking of a tail or something!

424
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,130
My natural surname is surely
Goloklhvastov.

425
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:20,470
- But ignorant boors like twisting.
- So it means you are not...

426
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:27,620
of that... of who... are not

427
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,960
not... the shaver's son?

428
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:39,070
That is, naturally...
a-formally...

429
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,730
Bodily, so as to say - I am.

430
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,920
But mindedly, by education,
we are a totally different model.

431
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,470
Not the same center. Of gravity.

432
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:54,660
So you are, like,

433
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,820
not a shaver anymore?
- Daddy!

434
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,420
I told you: the barberian!

435
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,100
- I forgot.
- That's nothing, that's simplicity.

436
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,809
You see, I do a lot of various commerce.

437
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:15,339
I have this delicate merchandise...
like powder, oh-deh-kolon, brilliantine

438
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,100
I'm just stinking with it.

439
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,250
Such a merchandise takes
a real bunch of cash.

440
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:26,720
Of cash I have a plenty and a bit.
I hold all Kiev merchants indebted.

441
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:32,730
My friends: ohvicers, cathedral
chorus basses, billiard markers

442
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:38,480
Told me: why don't you buy all
shops in the center of the city?

443
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:44,029
So I say: down with that headache!

444
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,029
When I had my villa built
in a good quiet place

445
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:52,670
It was a two... three...
like, storeyed house

446
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,479
I confess - it was so much troubel,
so much warries!

447
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,080
- Thatta rich!
- Money is not the man's worth.

448
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:03,200
But his good style is!

449
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,510
How educated he is.

450
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,260
Because when a man is letter'd

451
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:12,360
his world is now upside down.

452
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,180
Pardonnez, topsy-curvy.

453
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:21,380
And then where that one which one
is not letter'd sees white,

454
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:28,730
that's where he, which is the letter'd
one, he sees, like...

455
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,620
- Green?
- No! Speckled!

456
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,010
Phimka's a fool!

457
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,379
- Are you following me, Miss Pronia?
- Very much!

458
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:42,270
After being at finishing school
I see all in other color, too.

459
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,289
- She is right. We didn't scrimp
on that school. - No we didn't!

460
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:50,020
She knows all the fashions.
Come and see.

461
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:55,369
- Shall I serve that wine? I've
heated it up. - Get lost, stupid!

462
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,810
- Please, please.
- Yeah.

463
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,150
Here.

464
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:05,080
Look at her dresses.

465
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,770
- Shawls!        - Ah, mammy,
isn't that mauvais ton! Pardonnez.

466
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,280
- Merci.
- And here... Look.

467
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,980
Look here. Five pairs of shoes.
See the high heels like this.

468
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,370
Phimka's a fool!

469
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,280
- This one is foreign.
- A Dutch thing.

470
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,529
- That's nothing.
- Phimka's a fool!

471
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:28,960
Let's go see her room,
there's more than that in there!

472
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:33,550
- Mammy, it's not too clean!
- That's nothing.

473
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,190
This is the room of
the young lady.

474
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,250
The bed of the young lady.

475
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,630
A noble one indeed.

476
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:50,020
A blanket. Silk one.
Quilted at the monastery.

477
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:55,990
I'm sure your gifts to your daughter
have been more generous than just...

478
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,150
Oh, you don't say! Take a look.

479
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,800
That's how much gold we've bought.

480
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:09,560
- A bracelet 75 rubles worth, earrings...
- Maman!

481
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:13,130
And here, here!

482
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:20,920
- Yeah, Miss Pronia's got a taste.
- Merci for your compli-mun.

483
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,970
When a man is not like a common one,
because one is this and another is that,

484
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:31,210
and when the man's mind is not for
dancing but for self-cultivating,

485
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:35,440
for resolving why he exists,
for making his ways right,

486
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,560
and when such a man,
being learned,

487
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:44,540
uses his learning to fly above
the clouds, and there his mind

488
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,940
gets higher than the highest
belfry in Kiev

489
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:52,920
and when he takes a look from there
down here at the people

490
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:58,420
they'll seem to him... seem like
smallest of things...

491
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:01,180
...like mice, I think.

492
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,760
Pardonnez, like rats.

493
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:09,800
Because thatta man all right!

494
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:15,250
And that who is... like... him...
also a man though ignorant, but...

495
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,800
But why? This is but much and much!

496
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,460
Yeah! Yeah!

497
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,000
But... no!

498
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,330
- Isn't he intelligent!
- Scarily.

499
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,200
- May I smoke here?
- To your heart's comfort.

500
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:46,580
Is there some fire here?
For I left mine at my home fireplace.

501
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:51,370
- Chimeon, fire!
- Khimka! Bring fire!

502
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,980
- Phimka, fire!
- Phimka, fire!

503
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,250
Bring fire!

504
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,900
- Will you? - Thanks, off smoking.
I like sniffing up much better.

505
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:06,849
- Our deacon has a finest snuff...
- Down with your snuffy deacon!

506
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:09,279
- May I have a cigarette, please.
- Here you are.

507
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,750
They smoke!

508
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,459
- What's that thing?
- Fire.

509
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,980
- What fire?
- Cinder from the stove.

510
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,319
- What for?
- You shouted for that.

511
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,510
- Out, get out.
- A simpleton!

512
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,620
There's matches in the shop.
I'll fetch some.

513
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:31,000
Pretty Polly!

514
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:37,610
Let me be that particular person
who accompanies you to the place.

515
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,300
Please be, moo-sieur.

516
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,130
And you sit here.

517
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,540
This is our shop.
Please, moo-sieur.

518
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:15,780
- Your cigarette is crackling.
- That's my heart on fire.

519
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:17,780
- Why is that?
- Because of love.

520
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,730
Pardonnez.

521
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:30,060
There's something about you,
Pronia Prokopovna, that excites me

522
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:34,640
- ...like a quick carambole!
- Ah, that's a gallant flout.

523
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,880
You must've so many ladies around!

524
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,989
Pronia Prokopovna, I'm not a man
to leave my soul just there.

525
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:44,870
- Only where your soul is.
- Ah, I wish I could read your soul.

526
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,310
If you could, you would see there

527
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:55,900
golden scriptural letters saying:
Pronia... Prokopovna... Serkova.

528
00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:01,099
If the golden key of your heart
were in my pocket,

529
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:06,649
in the pocket of my heart's soul,
I would open it every minute to look

530
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:09,920
at that!
- Oh, how I wish it were true!

531
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,920
My bosom is a walloping Vesuvius!

532
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:22,239
Decide on my unfortunate destiny,
I beg your hand on my knees!

533
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,400
Oh my mom! I am so anxious!

534
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,609
Do you love me, you do? No cheating?

535
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:30,929
- We've known each other so little...
- Then you should know

536
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:33,129
that I have neved loved anyone
and never will!

537
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,960
- How's that?
- Except for you.

538
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,240
- D'you love me so much?
- I tell you: I just boil!

539
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:42,180
- How scary!
- Don't worry, I know the debonair.

540
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,450
Oh, I fell in love with you, too.

541
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,210
I agree to be your missus.

542
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,279
We just have to be blessed.
Maman!

543
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,640
No, don't move. Daddy! Will you!

544
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:11,560
Svirid Petrovich Golokhvastov
is proposing me.

545
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:18,440
Prokop Sviridovich and you,
Eudocia Philipovna.

546
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:23,210
I've had a conversation with your
sapient daughter about one

547
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:25,580
secret thing.

548
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:29,340
I want to have a sudden marriage
with her ladyship!

549
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:31,630
And her ladyship agrees.

550
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:38,090
Will you then bless this here...
desperate enterprise?

551
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:42,610
- We do as our daughter wants!
- Ditto.

552
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,440
Well, if so, then...

553
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,510
- What about your welfare?
- Wha'?

554
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:54,649
- Maybe you don't like me, so I...
- Daddy!

555
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:57,129
- We wish no better!
- This is best!

556
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:00,560
- We wish no better man!
- I agree!

557
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,450
Then take my lowest bow. Merci.

558
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:12,760
And the wedding, the quicker
the better. As for other things...

559
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,840
will you please meet my go-betweens.
- That's right.

560
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,600
"Now I'm a wealthy merchant,"

561
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,360
"That's what I think
in this bright day:"

562
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,890
"I should be really trenchant"

563
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,650
"And spend all money in my way."

564
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:41,710
"A country house, a house in city,"

565
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:46,040
"And so much more, the list is long"

566
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:50,340
"Whatever girl is smart and pretty"

567
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:53,020
"Will never fail to come along"

568
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,960
"Now I'm a wealthy merchant,"

569
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:59,860
"That's what I think
in this bright day:"

570
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,540
"I should be really trenchant"

571
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,210
"To waste all money in my way."

572
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:12,720
"With much relief and celebration"

573
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:16,460
"I'll go and close my barbershop"

574
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:20,670
"My soul is full of admiration"

575
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:23,330
"Begone, my razor and my swab!"

576
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:27,970
Aha! That's where we encounter.

577
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,429
- Bonjour.
- Imagine I wanted to search for ya.

578
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:34,819
- Eh? What's that for?
- I thought I had let you slip.

579
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,300
By no means, absolutely not!

580
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,075
I... I wanted to make a visit.

581
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:44,370
- To take a look at my passion.
- Then it's God sent you. Help with it!

582
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:49,419
Or maybe you amuse your mom-in-law
by taking me for a ride?

583
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,130
That's what I just thought.

584
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:07,090
"I'm in love and in great agitation"

585
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:12,020
"He will enter
in trump and in chime,"

586
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,850
"Hug my body with determination,"

587
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:22,030
"And announce I'll be his
for all time"

588
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:26,730
"We will ride in a bright
golden carriage"

589
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:31,530
"Smiles around will be
equally bright"

590
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,920
"You'll be mine in a
life-lasting marriage,"

591
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:40,630
"Hair of raven and bosom of white"

592
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,990
Phew, thank God, here we are.
Pay money.

593
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,730
Hoosh! Hoosh! Pest on you!

594
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,709
- Please come in.
- Bon jour to you in your home.

595
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,410
Be so kind to sit down.

596
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,029
Where's our dashing beauty?

597
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:15,350
She didn't come yet,
still on the market.

598
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:20,130
Oh, such a pity. Great pity.
My excuses, then.

599
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:25,459
I have a business to run.
Building a big barbershop,
the workers are waiting.

600
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:28,330
Let them wait. They can wait more.

601
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,950
You can't just leave my
saint's day party, can you!

602
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:37,640
Your saint's day? Oh! Then
my congrats on that holy event!

603
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:41,180
Take my innocent kiss
from my innocent lips.

604
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,990
God give health! God give wealth!

605
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:51,999
How do you do, my beauty! What a
stirring in my soul when I see you!

606
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,919
- Stop that ridiculing!
- No ridiculing on my mind.

607
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,179
- I have honourable intentions.
- I don't know what's going on.

608
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,130
Drop that pretention!

609
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,750
Treat the guest well.

610
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,960
- Mom!
- I'm going to the closet.

611
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,390
Leaving you for sweet nothings.

612
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:14,560
- Avoiding me, sweetie pie?
- I'm scared.

613
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,749
- What's on your mind?
- Get you, my chick, I'm in love!

614
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,279
- What's up? Can't you keep your
hands off me?       - How can I?

615
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,049
I got hot like a crimper! There's
such a vaudeville in my head, oh mercy!

616
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:31,299
- Oh my!
- I'm in love, first time!

617
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,390
What a pest! Let go! Don't touch me!

618
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:36,050
A bad fortune on me!

619
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:41,249
- Let-me-go!
- Ah! Full accord, then.

620
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,019
- God help you!
- Mammy, mom!

621
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,770
- He's stalking me.
- Enough of that!

622
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:47,590
Stop fooling me.

623
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:51,859
Let's sit down to table
and have the first drink.

624
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:56,880
Galka, fetch the glasses, lay
the table, our people are coming.

625
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:00,680
We'd better get going,
to avoid those rustic gossips.

626
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:08,590
That diamond in this heap of muck!

627
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,310
Let's stay. I'm feeling lucky.
Pronka will know nothing.

628
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,900
Hey, see your apple sister
boozing up!

629
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:25,209
Don't say so, daughter. Today's
her saint's day. We should greet her.

630
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:29,179
OK, run there to have the rustics
spit in your eyes! Drive on!

631
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,310
To the living and to the dead!

632
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:36,330
May the living never die,
and may the dead quietly lie!

633
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:39,399
- Galia!
- Same way next day!

634
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,480
- Same way next day!
- God help us!

635
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,070
Bonjour my sweety pie,
taste a bit of rye!

636
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:47,460
That's a great sin.

637
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:50,540
A sin's there to work on,
a sin's there to atone!

638
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:53,719
Have a drink, sister,
to wash away the sins!

639
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,800
You're a tempter, I'm a sinner!

640
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:00,850
- The saints of the Cave will know!
- Let them, they're our kin!

641
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:03,750
I can't stand it!
I'm a sinner, people!

[folk dancing song]

643
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:24,120
Come on! Cheer up!

644
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:19,110
My black beauty, my sweet cutie,
you make me whirl, let us swirl!

645
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,330
I love outrages!

646
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:18,860
Ladies, aren't they a couple!

647
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:22,770
Congratulate the engaged!

648
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,569
- Mom!
- Golokhvosty has proposed.

649
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:26,960
Pardonnez, madam,
do we really have to?..

650
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,130
- Don't ruin my life, mom!
- Shut up!

651
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:34,730
The daughter does not have to live
poor and wretched like her mom!

652
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:38,500
You'll marry a rich guy and
become a good dame yourself!

653
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,920
Who can hurt us then? Snooks!

654
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:45,790
Good women! Let's witness their
engagement and drink to it lawfully.

655
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:48,950
Pardonnez, madam! She's nuts!

- Stop here! I'm greeting my sister.
- Mammy, come back!

663
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:30,929
Mammy, what're you doing? Sit here.

664
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:31,909
- Let me go.
- Sit still.

Let me go, Pronia darling, let me!

Oh, people, you've got me anxious!

670
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,580
Woe me, a poor orphan!

671
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:00,810
My kinsfolk are shy of me!

672
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,550
Nobody of the Serkovs did as much
as set foot in my house.

673
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,270
- All because of that pecker Pronka!
- Are the Serkovs akin to you?

674
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:12,610
She's my sibling, and that
frog-pecker is my niece.

675

Silly head.
Cursed me and pushed me out.

Wish that viper!..
Ah, down with her.

677
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:24,550
- No foot of mine shall be in that
house while I'm alive.
- So you're at loggerheads?

678
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:43,010
Hey, snub nose! Look here!
It's a wedding veil!

Oh, Stepan!

- Woe me, Stepan darling!
- What's up?

681
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:07,699
- My mom made me engage!
- How's that? Who to?

682
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:10,120
This popinjay Golokhvosty!

683

- Golokhvosty?
- You see, he's rich.

684
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:14,979
What, he's rich?
He's a rascal, a sham!

685
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:16,490
How's that? Not rich?

686
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,109
- He's a bankrupt. My boss even
wanted him jailed! - Is it true?

687
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:22,960
I'll let no man have you!

688
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:24,950
I'll break anyone!..

689
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:31,549
Tie it well, or it will bite
the whole ceremony!

690
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,620
Pull it! Bring it here!

you should look here!

- The shaver, Golokhvosty.

- Dare you lie?
- You lie!

- You're a liar!  - It's your mother
had too much lying on her back.

- Heard of Golokhvostov?
- She lies, that's what she does!

01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:38,890
- She lies!
- Cross my heart she doesn't!

in the house and in the yard, too.

- Then I'll fix me a new house,

- Don't dawdle, the priest's waiting!

750
01:03:59,810 --> 01:04:01,440
- Right!
- True!

751
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,520
Oh my dear daughter!

752
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:39,900
Stop!

753
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:43,339
Eh... Aunt Sekleta may hinder
the wedding!

754
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:47,329
- Got to do something. Let's go, pals.
- Come on, let's go.

755
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:48,710
Hold it!

756
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,060
A vile wedding.

757
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:53,310
- Stop it!
- Sister?

758
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:56,609
- Sekleta Philipovna!
- Ah! Stealing my son-in-law?

759
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:58,579
- What son?
- My son-in-law.

760
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:00,340
- What?
- What son-in-law?

761
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:05,150
- What shkandalle are we having?
- People, yesterday he got engaged
to my daughter!

762
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:09,389
- Gentlemen, she's from the asylum!
- She's drunk!

763
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:12,409
- Don't stand! Get her off! Off!
- Madam!

764
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:14,999
- Get her off!
- Madam, madam, please!

765
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,170
Please, gentlemen!

766
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,529
Faster, faster, or
say goodbye to your money!

767
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:24,439
Golokhvosty is down to his last bob,
and her mother thinks he's rich!

768
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,490
Schweinerei!

769
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:30,290
- Sekleta Philipovna, what're you doing?
- Sister!

770
01:05:32,826 --> 01:05:34,572
Boor!

771
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:38,260
- What's the matter?
- Sister, wake up!

772
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:41,329
- Sekleta Philipovna!
- Peace, parish, peace!

773
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:44,259
Why did you string my baby along,
if you didn't want her?

774
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:46,499
- Svirid, what is she saying?
- That's a lie!

775
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,619
- Lie.
- Lie!

776
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:50,169
I won't allow very much
of such a publicity.

777
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:50,819
It's a lie!

778
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:54,389
This "shkandalle" can't be tolerated!
I'm Svirid Petrovich Golokhvastov!

779
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:56,989
I'm not something this way, I'm
this way something! A lie!

780
01:05:56,990 --> 01:06:02,199
- All police's in my pocket! I'll
have you arrested, jailed, scoured!
- Who, me?

781
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:06,839
- For the truth? For your engaging
my daughter? - You're an old liar!

782
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,759
- Liar!
- Sister, calm down.

783
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,069
- Let's handle this.
- No handling! I don't know her,

784
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:13,579
let alone her daughter. Absolutely.
- You don't know?

785
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:15,559
Never would've dreamt of
such a thing.

786
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:19,479
She's mad! Mr. Serkov, will this
old liar scold keep us here?

787
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,019
- Never ever!
- People, I am not a liar.

788
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:22,879
- People, I'm no liar!
- Prove, please!

789
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,250
- Prove it!
- Sisters!

790
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:29,980
My dears, testify that yesterday
he got engaged to my daughter.

791
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:35,950
- With my eyes and with these ears,
I witness they did.      - Yeah.

792
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,610
And here's my oath.

793
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:44,790
Strike me dead if I didn't
sing them engagement songs.

794
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:50,240
He was dancing with his garb off,
leading me into temptation...

795
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:55,870
Hell! Help! Water!

796
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,960
- Water!
- Water.

797
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:00,269
- Bring water!
- People, don't trust her.

798
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:04,530
She bribed her witnesses!
There's a court, there's newspapers!

799
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:07,789
- I have such acquaintances, real much!
- Damned liar!

800
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:09,830
Please, aunt, leave me.

801
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,150
- Please leave.
- What a fool you are.

802
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,580
- He was taking you for your money.
- Wrong, for love!

803
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,490
Ladies, will you please
tell her.

804
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:22,599
- He called her an owl.
- A sore-eyed toad, he did.

805
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,100
- A frog-pecker.
- Spat at 'er as if she were Satan.

806
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:29,309
That's a slander! Evil slander!
Pronia, listen, it's a slander!

807
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:31,730
Daughter! Water!

808
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:33,899
- Water!
- Phimka, water!

809
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:36,680
My child's murdered! People, help!

810
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:40,470
Water!

811
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:43,410
Water! Bring water!

812
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,900
Pronia, listen. My dear!

813
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:58,430
Why all your visits?

814
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:01,930
Why did you swear by God?
You swore...

815
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,270
And knelt before me.

816
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:08,180
You told me your heart was on fire.

817
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:11,810
But that was just a crackle
of your cigarette.

818
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:14,349
Dearest Pronia, look you,
this is but much and much.

819
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:16,890
It's not your shops
I was marrying.

820
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:20,620
- It was you I loved.
- My girl!

821
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,750
And you bring shame on me,
before the whole Kiev.

822
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:27,340
- Before the whole street.
- Daughter!

823
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:29,839
- My girl!
- But I... Miss Pronia,

824
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,560
this is but much and much.
- Away!

825
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,710
- Shaver!
- From behind the ditch.

826
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:37,180
Away!

827
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:41,820
I'll go.
You don't have to ask twice.

828
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:48,360
No, now I'm not letting you go.

829
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:50,699
- Back off.
- Let me talk to him now.

830
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:54,539
What's the use of talking?
Make him marry Galia and
tie him up in knots!

831
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:57,309
D'you think the rich are allowed
every dishonesty?

832
01:08:57,310 --> 01:08:58,819
- Let's bring Galia!
- Let's go.

833
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:01,100
- Stop it.
- Hold it!

834
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:04,740
Stop it! Don't let him marry Galia!

835
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:09,219
He's not rich, he owes me...
Stop it, don't wed them!

836
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:12,209
- Hold it! He's no rich.
- He's stripped. Show them.

837
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:14,890
- Show his bills!
- He's a bankrupt!

838
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:16,960
- Bankrupt.
- Bankrupt.

839
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:18,580
Bankrupt, bankrupt!

840
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:24,570
What are you staring at? OK, bankrupt.

841
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,980
Yes I am. A bankrupt.

842
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:34,009
And all that I needed was your money.

843
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:38,200
If I were rich, what would
I've done here in your garbage heap?

844
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,000
Pigs uneducated, that's what you are.

845
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:45,479
If I were rich, I'd have found
demoiselles in the city

846
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:48,970
wearing all foreign, head to foot,
their hair dressed like that.

847
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:51,949
Rather than wooed your filthy Pronka.

848
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:55,050
Let me hold him by his throat!

849
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:58,480
Bon jour, the aristocracy
of Tanner Street!

850
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:13,290
Hey, step aside!

851
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:15,430
- Come on.
- Come on, come on.

852
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:11,720
Bon jour! Let's go, friends.

853
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:17,410
"High above my head
a bird is singing"

854
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:22,350
"Flying to and fro, as does its kind"

855
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:27,090
"There's no reason why
we shouldn't go drinking"

856
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:31,350
"Having fun is all we have in mind"
