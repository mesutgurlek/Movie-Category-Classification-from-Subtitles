1
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,694
''Flash! The freighter,
Star of Capetown,

2
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:22,104
''was sunk today off
the north coast of Africa...

3
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,302
''by a mysterious explosion.

4
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:27,346
''All hands accounted for
with the exception of...

5
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,881
two unidentified
stowaways.''

6
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:40,053
Look at us.
Two on a raft,
sunny side up.

7
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:43,254
''I'll tell you how to get home.
We'll stow away,'' you said.

8
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,321
''No, sir,'' I said.
''Don't be a sap,'' you said.

9
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,833
''We're stowing away,
and that's that,'' you said.

10
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,961
''No, sir.''
Yak-yak-yak.

11
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,403
What a brilliant
conversationalist you are!

12
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:57,068
I took one look at that
crate and knew it would
blow up in our faces.

13
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,543
Wait till they find out who
was smokin' in the powder room.

14
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:02,046
Never mind that.
Look at us--

15
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,049
Food gone,
water gone.

16
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,211
What's that bulge
in your pocket?

17
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,988
Oh, that's--
Yeah, that.

18
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:14,424
That's an old
tobacco pouch.
When did you
start smokin' a pipe?

19
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,587
Ever since this morning,
cigarettes make me nervous.

20
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,894
You went to the store
and got tobacco?
You notice--

21
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,696
That's clever.
Come on, dig.

22
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,499
Hand it over here.
Let's see, reach.

23
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,040
Ohhh!
I forgot.
Surprised?

24
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,235
I figure two of'em for
one of us is better...

25
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,506
than one of'em
for two of us.

26
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,515
You can spit
your teeth in there.

27
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,143
Just dunk it lightly.

28
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,053
Well,Junior,
we gotta face it.

29
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:46,558
We may be days and days
without seeing a ship or land.

30
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,060
We're gonna get
mighty hungry.

31
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:53,497
- What do you mean, get hungry?
- We'll toss a coin.

32
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,468
What's the date?
Hea--

33
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,471
1910!

34
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,734
Pretty close...
1911 .

35
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,936
That's the way it goes--
somebody loses, somebody wins.

36
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:09,038
So you win the nickel!
See if you can find any
white meat on that buffalo.

37
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:13,745
I got a T.L. for you.
We tossed for something
much deeper than that.

38
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,620
I remember a story
about two fellows like us,

39
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,558
castaways.
They tossed a coin, too.
Uh-huh.

40
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,029
They figured there's no use
both of them starving.
Naturally.

41
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,932
The fellow who survived used
to tell his grandchildren
about his pal's sacrifice.

42
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,698
That's very--
Wait a minute.

43
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,207
What pal's sacrifice?
I don't know, though.

44
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,369
You should've
eaten more oatmeal.
You're kind of scrawny.

45
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:42,778
I don't think you'd
do me more than a week,
and there's no icebox aboard.

46
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,477
Jeff, you're losing
your buttons.

47
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,042
You mean, you'd eat me,
without vegetables?

48
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,454
Calm down,Junior.
I'm not gonna do
anything right away.

49
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,857
I might not do
anything for a week.
Not until I get desperate.

50
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:58,954
You wouldn't like me.
Once I bit my tongue
and I tasted awful.

51
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,364
Help!
Jeff, don't--
Turkey, look!

52
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,966
Am I seeing things?
What?

53
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:10,066
What is that
over there?
Land! Land!

54
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,202
We're saved!
We're saved!
Yo-ho!
Yo-ho!

55
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,906
Hey! Hey!
A submarine!

56
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,949
Man the pumps!
Man the pumps!

57
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,650
Last stop!

58
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,322
Got a stone
in my shoe.

59
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:34,127
Wait a minute!

60
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,967
I hope Aunt Lucy's
lookin' down...

61
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,029
and seein' the way
you're treating me.

62
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,837
You gonna stuff
Aunt Lucy down
my throat again?

63
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:48,404
Never mind. She saw you tossin'
the coin and lickin' your chops.

64
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,382
You're certainly sloughing off
your promise to her.

65
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:55,820
Aunt Lucy... I can see her now
lying on her dying bed...

66
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:58,914
lookin' at you with those
big, trusting eyes.

67
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:02,256
''Before I go,Jeff, promise me
one thing,'' she said.

68
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:06,788
''Promise me you'll always be
a friend to little Orville.

69
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,768
''No matter what happens, you'll
never leave the little jerk.

70
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,635
Promise me,Jeff.
Promise me,'' she said.

71
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:17,540
Then she up and died before
I had a chance to say no.
Shh!

72
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,044
Who you shushing?
What's the matter?

73
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:23,549
I hope she didn't hear.
The dead have a way
of comin' back.

74
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,880
When they're dead,
they're dead.

75
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,183
Not Aunt Lucy.
She was a Republican.

76
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,088
Okay,Junior,
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,126
I guess I shouldn't
have said that.

78
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,855
You know how
I feel about ya.

79
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:40,490
I guess in my own way
I sorta love you.

80
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,202
All right, but you don't
have to slobber all over me.

81
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,797
I guess I kinda
love you, too.

82
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,143
Now wait a minute.
Stop kissing me.

83
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,909
What are you talkin' about?
I didn't--
You did too!

84
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,747
Are you crazy?
I don't mind being kissed...

85
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,946
but this
is ridiculous.

86
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,290
You did it again.
I did not.

87
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,292
You didn't?
No.

88
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,820
I felt something...
like a wet paint brush.

89
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:15,629
You did? I did too.
I thought it was you.

90
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,101
And I thought
it was you.

91
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,806
You see!
Aunt Lucy's come back.

92
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:25,173
You did it with all that
disrespectful talk. Aunt Lucy!

93
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,676
What's that?

94
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,980
What's the matter?
You yellow?

95
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:36,852
It's only a kangaroo.
What're you gettin' scared for?
Yeah.

96
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,289
Let's take a ride.

97
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,349
This is probably--

98
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,590
Good girl.
Good girl.

99
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,202
We got enough gas?
I got her carburetor
cut down to nothin'.

100
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,364
Where do you
suppose we are?

101
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,876
This must be the place
where they empty all
the old hourglasses.

102
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:01,107
I think this is what's left
after I clean my spinach.

103
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,239
Hey, look!

104
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,247
They could've thought
of another way to get us here.

105
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,480
Here we go again.

106
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,821
Beats the bus, huh?
Beats me.

107
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,228
# How can we be sure #

108
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:29,070
# I'll lay you 8 to 5
that we meet Dorothy Lamour #

109
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:34,909
# Off on the road
to Morocco #

110
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,348
# Hang on till
the end of the line #

111
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,015
# I hear this country's
where they do #

112
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,523
#The dance
of the seven veils #

113
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,219
#We'd tell you more
but we would have #

114
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,455
#The censor
on our tails #

115
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:55,763
#We certainly do
get around-ound-ound #

116
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,065
# Like Webster's dictionary #

117
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:01,402
#We're Morocco bound #

118
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:08,880
#We're off on the road
to Morocco #

119
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,041
Look out!
Clear the way!

120
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,142
'Cause here we come.

121
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,848
#The men eat fire
sleep on nails #

122
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,255
#And saw their wives
in half #

123
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:24,160
# It seems to me there should be
easier ways to get a laugh #

124
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,634
#We're off on the road
to Morocco #

125
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:33,604
#And somewhere
I feel kind of numb #

126
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:40,101
# For any villains we may meet
we haven't any fear #

127
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:44,946
# Paramount will protect us
'cause we're signed for
five more years #

128
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:49,283
#We certainly do get around #

129
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:53,314
Like a set of Shakespeare
you buy in the drugstore
for $1 .98.

130
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,519
#We're Morocco bound #

131
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,122
Or like a volume of
Omar Khayyam that you
buy at Christmastime...

132
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,132
for your cousin Julia.

133
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,432
#We're Morocco bound ##

134
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,735
##

135
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,844
Wonder if you can get a handout
in this burg? I'm starved.

136
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,380
If that guy wasn't lookin',
I'd eat a rug.
Plain?

137
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,068
Orville,
where are you?

138
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,006
Over here behind
these goose pimples.

139
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:19,602
Reckon there's been some
sort of shootin' ruckus
at the Buckeye Saloon.

140
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,874
I ain't a-lookin' for trouble,
partner, but if trouble...

141
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,415
comes a-lookin' for me, I'm
gonna be mighty hard to find.

142
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,386
Say, fuzzy, who is that
headstrong, impetuous boy?

143
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,582
He is Mullay Kassim,
the desert sheik.

144
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,625
What'd he come to town for?
A manicure?

145
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,491
He loves the Princess Shalmar
of Karameesh.

146
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,553
He has come to ask her
to marry him.

147
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:42,067
I'd hate to be around when
he comes for a divorce!

148
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,364
You short of blades?

149
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:48,396
It's a strange country,
Buster.
Yeah.

150
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,173
Well, not too strange.
It's food

450
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:04,590
I want you to stay.
I think I could be
happy here.

451
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:08,655
Come on. Daddy's tired and I
have to catch up on my reading.

452
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:12,134
Good night, Geoffrey.
Good night.

453
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,917
Do it some more.
Do it some more.

454
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:40,590
Come on, bub, rub.
Why is the princess
going to marry you?

455
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:43,634
She was to have married
Mullay Kassim, the desert sheik.

456
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:47,296
Why has she
changed her mind?
Sheiks have gone out of style.

457
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,068
The modern girl wants
a nice, reliable wolf.

458
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:53,042
Do it some more.
I'll get you time and
a half for overtime.

459
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,909
There's something
very strange about it all.

460
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:01,179
Something very,
very strange.
It's a strange country.

461
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:05,313
Orville,
listen.
Huh?

462
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,757
If this were known,
it would mean my death.

463
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:11,659
But in my heart,
there is a great love for you.

464
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:16,098
You too? If this keeps up,
I'll have to buy a scooter.

465
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:21,264
Is my love hopeless,
or do you have some
crumbs of affection for me?

466
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:26,276
You know how a prince is.
I may set you up with a
little hat shop or something.

467
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:29,711
What a racket!

468
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,080
We're trying a new shade,
nightingale's blush.

469
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,346
Nightingale's blush...
that's sweet.

470
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,186
You get a complete
recondition and you'll
still look like a warthog.

471
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:42,488
Gals, get a breath of
fresh air. Beat it. Scat.

472
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,653
Just a second. I'm giving
the orders around here.

473
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:47,789
She's only done 9 toes.
She can do
the other 3 later.

474
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:50,129
I want to put him
under the dryer. Beat it.

475
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:53,034
Don't be too rash.
You'll spoil him.
Don't go far, girls.

476
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:56,938
Go on.
I may need you.

477
00:32:57,008 --> 00:33:00,671
Who are these Christmas tigers?
Who are they yessin'?

478
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:03,714
The princess' old man used to
use this for a courtroom.

479
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:06,011
He never lost a case.

480
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,143
That's very nice.
That's nifty.

481
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:11,086
Look, puffy, I want to have
a talk with you, man to man.

482
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,851
Who's gonna hold up your end?
I'll see you in a couple weeks.

483
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,189
I have no time
for riffraff.
Think you're
cute, don't you,

484
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,251
sending me that note:
they're torturing you.

485
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,388
Get out of town. There's
nothin' I can do for you.

486
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,831
There is nothing.
I can handle it myself.

487
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,391
I want you to leave.
I know how you operate.

488
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,995
I don't want a best man.
Figure you'll move in, huh?

489
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:31,166
You figure you'll
wind up the prince.
Could be.

490
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:35,576
You're takin' a powder...
right now.
That's gratitude!

491
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,410
You seem to be forgettin'
I sold you into all this.

492
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,610
Now you want
to toss me out.
Don't give me that!

493
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:44,246
You thought you were selling me
into pickin' cotton with whips.

494
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:49,724
Wait a minute!

495
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,785
Where do you think
you're going?

496
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:55,026
What's in there?
Nothing...just
milady's boudoir.

497
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:58,796
What are you doin' goin'
in there?
It's a strange
country, chum.

498
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,271
Find my friend a little corner
to sleep in at the snake house.

499
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,309
You big phony.
Get yourself a rattle
to play with.

500
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,901
Nice parlay...
from you to the snake.
Cuddle with a cobra.

501
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,947
Happy fangs!

502
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:14,781
You can't do this to me!
Bye, fellows.

503
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:42,209
#Moonlight becomes you #

504
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,580
#It goes with your hair #

505
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:50,644
# You certainly know
the right thing #

506
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:53,155
# To wear #

507
00:34:55,226 --> 00:35:00,289
# Moonlight becomes you #

508
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:04,824
# I'm thrilled
at the sight #

509
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:08,963
#And I could get
so romantic #

510
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,339
#Tonight #

511
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:17,347
#You're all dressed up
to go dreaming #

512
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,646
# Now don't tell me
I'm wrong #

513
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:25,712
#And what a night
to go dreaming #

514
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:30,386
# Mind if I tag along #

515
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:36,627
#If I say
I love you #

516
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:40,899
# I want you to know #

517
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:45,773
# It's not just because
there's moonlight #

518
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:48,835
#Although #

519
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:53,748
# Moonlight
becomes you so #

520
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:02,319
## [ Whistling ]

521
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:09,765
##

522
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:14,965
# Moonlight becomes you #

523
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:21,673
## [ Whistling ]

524
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,577
#What a beautiful you #

525
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,552
##

526
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:34,751
# Moonlight and you #

527
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:39,228
#You're all dressed up
to go dreaming #

528
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:43,028
# Now don't tell me
I'm wrong #

529
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,434
#And what a night
to go dreaming #

530
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:52,374

#Although #

535
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:21,160
# Moonlight
becomes you so ##

536
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:36,445
Orville, wake up!

537
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,512
Wake up.
Okay, Mom, I'll get
a job tomorrow.

538
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,581
No, no, no.
Wake up!

539
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:45,060
What's the matter?
The princess is unfaithful.
She cares nothing for you.

540
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,893
I'll see you in
the hat shop later.
Listen!

541
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:51,298
At this moment, she and
your friend are in
each other's arms.

542
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:55,931
Yeah, well--
What?
Yes. Look.

543
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:59,101
The lowdown,
double-crossing centipede!

544
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:02,805
Trying to climb into my shoes
and pull the roof over his head.

545
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,939
The crawling lizard!

546
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,950
I'll show him what a salami
has gotta go through.

547
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:09,680
Don't waste your anger
upon them.
Ahhh!

548
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:14,418
Let us fly together.
Okay, but let go
of my landing gear.

549
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,619
You and I, thus,

550
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:20,562
and thus, and thus
will my love consume you.

551
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:28,736
From manufacturer
direct to consumer.

552
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,434
I go!

553
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,636
Excuse me.
Beloved.

554
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:36,839
Beloved!
Thus.

555
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,910
I g--

556
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:45,751
Let me ask you something,
Princess.

557
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:50,283
Suppose you put off
this wedding a little,
and I hung around a little,

558
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:53,387
and you grew to like me.
Wouldn't that change things?

559
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,398
No, Geoffrey,
it would not.

560
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:58,435
I like you now.
The more I get to like you,

561
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,096
the more reason I will have
to marry Orville.

562
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,232
You like me so you're
gonna marry Orville.

563
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,572
That's a new
kind of brush.

564
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:11,013
That is the way it must be.
There are many things
you don't understand.

565
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:15,143
Later you will know.
Before you get hooked up
to that character,

566
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:17,380
there's a few things
you ought to know.

567
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:21,050
What do you mean?
Sit down.

568
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:27,694
To give an idea of what kind of
double-crossin' hoodlum he is--

569
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:31,166
Oh, no. It's too fantastic.
You'd never believe it.

570
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:33,169
Go on, what happened?

571
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:37,196
We're broke and he sells me,
his best friend, for 200 bucks.!

572
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:40,607
- Practically gives me away.
- I thought you sold him?

573
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,442
That's the way he tells it.
There's two sides to everything.

574
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:46,642
That's impossible.
The men brought Orville to me.

575
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,413
They come to pick me up
and get him by mistake.

576
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:52,513
I don't under--
By rights, I should
be in his spot.

577
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:56,549
You should be marrying me
instead of him. There's
two sides to everything.

578
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:58,561
Ow! Hey!

579
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:02,360
What's the big idea?
There's two sides
to everything.

580
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:18,547
Princess, he's here.
Mullay Kassim!

581
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,328
Mullay Kassim,
my lord.

582
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,591
Where is this--
this dog?

583
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:37,691
Hold your anger.
Wait until you've he--
I've already heard.

584
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,498
It's whispered that on
the day set for our wedding,

585
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:43,734
you're planning to marry
this... American!

586
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:46,971
Is it true?
Tell me.

587
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,205
Yes, Kassim,
it is true.

588
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,441
But it is only--
Enough!

589
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:53,847
Come, Ahmed Caspa.
Let us find this man.

590
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:58,651
Let us see the color of his
liver... hang his carcass
for the jackals to nibble.

591
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:00,690
No, wait.

592
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,659
First you must hear the words
of Hyder Khan, the wise one.

593
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:07,629
Hyder Khan?
Very well, Shalmar.

594
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:10,633
Five minutes does not matter
in the life of a cockroach.

595
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:12,635
Come.

596
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:18,807
And it is here, written in
the stars, O Lion of the Desert,

597
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:21,902
that the first husband of
the Princess Shalmar...

598
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,779
will die a violent death
within the week of the marriage.

599
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:29,183
What is that
you say?
It is also written...

600
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:34,589
that her second husband
will be blessed with
long life and happiness.

601
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,650
Now do you understand?

602
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:40,925
The American,
as my first husband,
will die within the week.

603
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,263
Then, as the wise one said,
I will be free to marry
the man I love.

604
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:49,204
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
This is a great joke.

605
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:52,902
It'll be retold as long
as men live in Karameesh.

606
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:09,056
First time I ever saw
steam heat in print.

607
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:13,956
Orville.
Orville?

608
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,295
Just when it was
getting interesting.

609
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:20,201
Hello, Hon.
Did you tell Geoffrey he's
not to stay for the wedding?

610
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,035
That we didn't want
him here at all?
I hinted at it.

611
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,405
I gave him a map and
provisions for 3 months.

612
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,637
I can't understand why
you don't like him.

613
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:31,044
He's one of the
nicest men I've ever met.
He's a nice fellow,

614
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:33,379
as nice fellows go:
and, why don't he?

615
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,611
There's something
I must tell you.

616
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:39,247
This is a very
strange country.
Yeah.

617
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:42,690
Like you running into me
and buying me like I was
a potato.

618
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,025
And me baked ever since.
Ho-hum.

619
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:49,293
No, I mean we have
very strange customs,

620
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,391
very strange laws.

621
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:54,562
For the first week of a marriage
a man and wife live separately.

622
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:58,438
Yeah, well, every--
Huh?

623
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,477
It is a custom
thousands of years old.

624
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:03,411
Customs... you make 'em,
you break 'em, they come and go.

625
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,539
Did I tell you
about Prohibition?

626
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:08,210
It has been so
for thousands of years.

627
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:10,378
There can be
no other way.

628
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:14,652
Honey, don't take on so.
It's only a week.
Yes, only a week.

629
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:18,388
Orville, when I look at you
and think of our marriage,

630
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:21,226
I can't help crying.

631
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:25,496
You're so young...
much, much too young.

632
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:28,197
You don't have to worry
about me, baby.

633
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,797
I just read a book.

634
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,444
Oso Bucco,
come here!

635
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:49,219
When was
this American born?

636
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:53,491
I can't finish his tomb
until I have the date.
I don't know, Ahmed.

637
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,691
We don't know
what we're doing.

638
00:43:55,766 --> 00:44:00,794
Another thing... we're making
his coffin too small.

639
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:03,362
I tried my wife
in it this morning.

640
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,705
Her feet were
hanging out.
What are we
going to do?

641
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:11,908
We're just guessing.
We're going to do a sloppy job.

642
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:15,440
While the American is alive
why don't we measure him?

643
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:18,352
We couldn't do that!
He would find out.

644
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,686
There are ways.

645
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:24,717
There are ways!
Come on.

646
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:37,102
Right now I could use
a hole in my head.

647
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:49,245
Could we disturb you,
Master?
What do you want?

648
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:53,756
If it is not too much trouble,
we would like to measure you.
What for?

649
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:59,221
We are making something for you.
It's a surprise.

650
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,196
Something for
the wedding.

651
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:05,258
This is for
after the wedding.

652
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:10,238
- Sort of a male trousseau?
- Yes, Master, sort of.

653
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:13,140
All right, go ahead.
Measure away.
Thank you, Master.

654
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:17,237
It will be brief.
Waist,
thirty-four.

655
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:20,010
The princess has an eye for
beauty, so pretty me up.

656
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:22,177
Sew in plenty of muscles.
Make it zooty.

657
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:26,313
We will make you look
even better than you do now.
Oh, thanks.

658
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:30,190
Chest normal,
forty-one.
Normal, forty-one.

659
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:34,320
Chest expanded,
forty-one.
Ches--

660
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,491
Give me room.
I like to spread out.

661
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,628
Perhaps the master
would lie down.
Certainly.

662
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:47,675
5' 1 1 '' overall.
5' 1 1 '' overall.

663
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:51,909
Put a lot of padding in it.
I don't want anything stiff.

664
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:57,284
I assure you, it will be
no stiffer than yourself.

665
00:45:57,354 --> 00:46:01,188
- Good day.
- Good day, Master.

666
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,089
Good day.

667
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:07,426
One question, Master.
What is the date of your birth?

668
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:11,161
Birth?
What do you want that for?

669
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:15,331
- It is for the record.
- September 1 3th, 1 91 3.

670
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:17,305
On a Friday.

671
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:22,038
Thank you, Master. We must go.
We have to carve--

672
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:30,485
Carve it?
And what was that... business?

673
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:32,522
Orville?

674
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:35,649
Orville, those two men--
What were they doing here?

675
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:38,524
They were measuring me
for some outfit.
Measuring you!

676
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:40,927
Do you know
who they are?
The royal dressmakers.

677
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:44,729
No, my beloved.
They're undertakers.
Well, that--

678
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:48,033
Huh? They were measuring me
for a graveyard gabardine?
Yes.

679
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:52,902
Jeff.Jeff.

680
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,240
There you are. I gotta
have a talk with you.

681
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,576
Orvie, I've been doin'
a lot of thinkin'.

682
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,617
There's no use you and I
arguing anymore. I'm
gonna beat it out of here.

683
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:02,675
That's it... you're not.
You don't have to.

684
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:05,153
I admit I tried
to cut in on you.

685
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:07,452
Whatever you've got,
Shalmar's goin' through with it.

686
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:09,754
That's all been changed.
Huh?

687
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,761
I'm the guy
that's shoving off.

688
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,593
I've been watching you two
and you're made for each other.

689
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,190
You look good together...
just the right size.

690
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:19,258
You're takin' her.
I'm givin' her to you.

691
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,429
What are you
cookin' up?

692
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:25,134
The last gal you gave me
was that lady wrestler.

693
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:28,667
What's behind all this?
I got to thinking
about the burying--

694
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:31,441
I mean the marrying.
It wouldn't last.

695
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:35,144
In a week, I'd be cold.
Besides, I got a girl.

696
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:38,711
I got her at the harem,
right off the assembly line.
Nice model.

697
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:41,280
He's gonna fly with me.
My love will consume him thus...

698
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,258
and thus,
and thus...

699
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:47,195
Aunt Lucy?
A girl can eat
too much yeast.

700
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:49,459
But, my very own--
Yeah, later.

701
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,467
You gotta catch me
when I'm in the mood.

702
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,469
You ain't been out of it
for twenty years.

703
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,869
This is a whole new
shuffle... you two!

704
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:59,238
Wait till Shalmar
hears about this.
It's not gonna be easy.

705
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:02,369
It's gonna be a tough assignment
to get Shalmar to give me up.
A struggle.

706
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:05,074
But you can handle it.
You've got everything I've got,

707
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:08,743
and you've had it
many years longer.
I got rid of mine.

708
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:13,279
It's gonna tear the heart
out of her but I'll catch
her on the rebound.

709
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:15,416
She might settle
for me.
That's the spirit.

710
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:19,826
I'll be right behind you...
see you through to the end,
leave no stone unturned.

711
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:24,061
Why don't we fly away?
Why don't you fly around
and warm your motor?

712
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:27,262
I'll join you later.
Orville?

713
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,449
Orville.
Orville!

714
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:44,078
This is disgraceful!
Tsk, tsk.
Shh!

715
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:47,749
I'm not gonna let you do this
dreadful thing to Geoffrey.

716
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:49,018
Shh.!

717
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,754
You'll be the
death of me yet.

718
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:56,424
Please, Aunt Lucy.
You've got to talk to him,
tell him the truth.

719
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,934
I ain't doin' nothin'.
Look what he did to me!

720
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:02,301
I insist. If you
don't tell him, I will.

721
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:04,966
You can't talk to him.
You're in my dream.

722
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:07,772
Goodness, gracious me!
That's right.

723
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:10,244
We're only allowed to be
in one dream a week.

724
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:12,839
Mr.Jordan doesn't like us
pestering people.

725
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:15,612
- I can understand that.
- I've got to make him hear me.

726
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:17,153
Geoffrey!

727
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:21,714
Geoffrey.!
Geoffrey.!
Shh.!

728
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,727
Shh!
Geoffrey!

729
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,888
Oh, oh.!

730
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,933
Take your hands
off me.! Stop it.!

731
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,628
Oh, oh.! Ahhh.!

732
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:35,536
Guess that'll show her.
[ Moaning ]

733
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:37,732
Your feet are cold.

734
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:41,734
You see, Master.
Wings!

735
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,576
And more than that,
they have legs.

736
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,741
Insects! Fireflies!

737
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:50,753
What are they doing
in my telescope?

738
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,119
I don't know. I haven't
cleaned the lenses for a week.

739
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:57,024
Dear, oh, dear!

740
00:49:57,094 --> 00:50:01,724
I must have mistaken these
fireflies forJupiter and Venus.

741
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:04,494
Yes, Master, you've certainly
gummed up the works.

742
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:06,763
Indeed, I have.

743
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,828
My prophesies for
the American's death...

744
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:12,363
were based on the fixed
positions ofJupiter and Venus.

745
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:15,206
This doesn't add up.
I want you.

746
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:19,078
You say you want me,
Orville says it's okay,
and you're gonna marry him.

747
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:23,108
It's something I can't explain.
We're going to be married.

748
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:26,849
That's all I have to say.
I've something
to say too!

749
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:30,290
I'm not in love
with you anymore.
I got another girl.

750
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,057
No more talk.
Go to your room and
prepare for the wedding.

751
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:37,066
I just got one thing
to tell you, Princess--

752
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:40,262
I'm going to my room
and prepare for the wedding.

753
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:43,738
Okay, fellas,
who's got the dice?

754
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:46,799
He's a pip, brushing off
a dream like you.

755
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:50,313
Instead of a wedding,
you'd think he was
going to his own funeral.

756
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,076
Yes... wouldn't you?

757
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,243
Princess,
Princess!

758
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:58,185
Mistress of my life,
listen and be merciful.

759
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:00,155
I have made
a calamitous error.

760
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,418
You must not
marry that American.

761
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:05,325
You must marry
Mullay Kassim!
Mullay Kassim?

762
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,659
I must hear
everything.

763
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,962
Your life is influenced
byJupiter and Venus,

764
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:15,095
so it is my painful
duty to tell you
what I've learned.

765
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:27,316
You are indeed the favored
one of Allah, O Master.

766
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:31,047
To marry the princess,
most men in Karameesh
would gladly die.

767
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:34,318
Yes.
That's what's
worrying me.

768
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:37,485
So you see, they turned
out to be fireflies.

769
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:40,462
I was wrong
about everything.

770
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,832
Geoffrey!

771
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:48,735
Don't you see?
Isn't it wonderful?

772
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:51,239
Yes, it's pretty good.
What's wonderful about it?

773
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:53,708
It just means Turkey's
back in circulation...

774
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,712
and you get tied up
to Mullay Kassim.
Mullay Kassim.

775
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,045
Geoffrey, you may
feel strange about
marrying a princess,

776
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:03,052
but I'll spend the rest
of my life trying
to live it down.

777
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:07,716
You mean, you and me?
Is that what you mean?

778
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,282
Mistress!

779
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,351
You see,
Hyder Khan?

780
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:16,525
You see what your
fireflies have done?
How about this!

781
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,228
Wait'll I break
the news to doodlebug.

782
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:22,931
That's why Orville
was so anxious to
hand you over to me!

783
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:25,839
I think he got wind
of this whole thing.

784
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:28,605
Don't say anything to him,
not just yet.

785
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:31,238
Don't worry about me.
I'll handle him!

786
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:34,112
Shalmar and I
had a little talk,

787
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:36,982
and we've decided to accept
your generous offer.

788
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:39,487
What generous offer?
You giving me to her.

789
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:41,990
She's decided
to accept me.

790
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:44,458
The guys are working on
the nuptial knots.

791
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:47,258
No kidding!
I knew you'd see it.

792
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,026
You two, what a pair!
Hand-in-hand!

793
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,694
Brother, you're gonna
have the happiest week.

794
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:56,261
You're gonna be in clover!
Yes, sir, deep in clover.

795
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:58,998
[ Speaking Arabic ]

796
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:01,703
Have you
told me all?
Oh, Sheik.

797
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:03,905
I have told you
what has befallen,

798
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,005
trusting in your
generosity to reward me.

799
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,075
Here.

800
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:11,950
You must hurry,
O Mighty One!

801
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:15,924
When I left, the princess and
her consort were preparing
to leave the country.

802
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:38,940
Hurry!
There isn't much time.

803
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:41,848
Get some sense
into your noggin,
and you and me blow.

804
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:44,853
We're going to
the United States
to get hooked up.

805
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:49,381
Hyder Khan's got that jinx
spread all over the world.

806
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:53,088
Yeah? Let's see him
mess around in Brooklyn.

807
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:04,167
Here comes Murder,
Incorporated.
Call me later.

808
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:17,709
So, that is your plan!
Running away with this dog.

809
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:21,416
I could show a dog
a few things about
running right now.

810
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:24,983
I'm not mixed-up in this.
I'm tending the gardens.

811
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:28,121
These tulips need
pruning... have one?

812
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:31,531
You lie to Kassim?
No, but it's
a big switch now.

813
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,933
I gave her up.
I'm on your side.

814
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:36,871
They're ducking out on you,
the dirty double-crossers!

815
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,704
What do you think we
ought to do with them?

816
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:42,802
What is this?

817
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,212
So, there's
another one!
Nice going,Junior.

818
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:51,049
Remind me to throw you
a piece of cheese
in the morning.

819
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,146
Kassim--
Silence!

820
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:56,659
Who is this goat?
This moon-faced son
of a one-eyed donkey?

821
00:54:56,726 --> 00:55:00,162
I wouldn't let him call
me that, even if there
is a resemblance.

822
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,562
Where do you come off
cutting in here?

823
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,998
Go play cops and robbers
someplace else!

824
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:08,367
Beat it, scat, shoo!
Slap his teeth out.
I'll hold your coat.

825
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:10,702
I'll hold
your coat too.

826
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,833
Kassim, please.
Please!

827
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:16,072
Quiet! You dare oppose
the will of Kassim?
Oppose your will?

828
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,047
I'll have you writing one
if you mess with me!

829
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:23,176
Take a poke at him.
We're not afraid
of him... are ya?

830
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:25,380
Enough!
You are coming with me.

831
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:27,548
Caspa, take one of
the girls for yourself.

832
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:29,649
Just a minute.
Okay, pal,
I'm with ya.

833
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:31,887
He says she's
going with him.

834
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:34,794
She's going
with him?
He says she's
going with him.

835
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:37,196
He make joke.
Funny boy.

836
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:40,202
Patty cake, patty cake,
baker's man!

837
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:43,103
Bake a cake as--

838
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,942
Yes, sir,Junior!

839
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:51,242
That thing
sure got around.
Yeah, and back to us.

840
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:53,908
Run for your lives.!

841
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:17,406
This way!

842
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:19,601
Come on, nipper.
Shake a slipper!

843
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:21,906
Okay, lover.
Head for cover!

844
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:23,138
Hurry!

845
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:27,411
You two girls hide
in there, quick!

846
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,850
No, not you!

847
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:32,444
We'll stay here
and hold them off.
Yeah, we'll--

848
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:36,583
Who, us?
Who are you kidding?
Let's spread out.

849
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:40,754
Two of you that way.
Search the tower!

850
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:43,799
Search the palace!

851
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:50,862
Two of you
in there.

852
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,377
Search,you dogs.!

853
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:59,006
My white stallion to the man
who brings me their heads.

854
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:02,518
They must learn what it means to
incur the wrath of Mullay Kassim.

855
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,019
They're not in here.
There's no
trace of them.

856
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,420
Highness,
we cannot find them.

857
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:11,358
We must find them and
slit their throats.
Yes, Your Highness.!

858
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:14,363
They shall die slowly.
Their tongues shall
be ripped out.!

859
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:17,525
Their ears shall be sliced off
and dried on sticks.

860
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:24,362
Search the corridors!

861
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:28,673
We'll find them if we have
to tear down the palace!
Yes, Your Highness.

862
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:01,027
Ah... ah...

863
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:05,032
ah, ah, ah...

864
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,169
ah-choo!

865
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,316
Call the men!

866
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,149
Stand up,
you dog.!

867
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:21,679
You thought you'd slip
through my fingers, huh?

868
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:25,216
After him!
Get the horses ready!

869
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:28,696
I was just going for
a broom to sweep
this stuff up.

870
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:32,496
Mullay Kassim will
take care of you
in the desert!

871
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,662
Aunt Lucy!

872
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:10,702
I never thought I'd wind up
in a camel's snood!

873
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:16,606
A fine pal you are,
letting me give her up!

874
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:19,307
And all the time you knew
you weren't gonna die!

875
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:22,180
That's what's killing me.
You weren't gonna die!

876
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:23,980
Give me credit.

877
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:26,453
That's pretty hard to do,
beatin' you and the embalmer.

878
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:42,868
I feel like the
morning mail.
R.F.D.

879
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:45,931
Look, they're leaving us!
All alone in the desert.

880
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,876
No food, no water,
no nothing!

881
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:58,449
Come on. Let's start
the sack race.

882
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:01,957
Where do we go?
Let's hop over the hill
and see what's doin'.

883
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:04,858
Must be a gas station
somewhere around here.

884
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:16,503
What are you still
hoppin' for?

885
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:20,474
We've been out of
those nets all day.
I want to keep my watch going.

886
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:25,139
How did we get loose with
our hands and feet tied
and everything?

887
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:29,116
If we told anybody,
they'd never believe it.
Oh.

888
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:32,677
Let's not
tell 'em, huh?
Shh... proceed.

889
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:39,557
See anything?
Nothing.

890
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,790
Come on.
Courage, boy!

891
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,799
Courage, he says.
Look at that!

892
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:48,200
You know what they are?
They're buzzards.!

893
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:50,796
They're carrying
finger bowls too.

894

I placed my rifle like this.

1043
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:03,979
Hello.
Oh, interesting.
And then what happened?

1044
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:06,954
One of the fellows
grabbed the rifle
and pointed it at me.

1045
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:09,422
You mean,
like this?

1046
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:12,858
Except that he put it
right up against my head.
Like this!

1047
01:12:12,928 --> 01:12:14,657
Yes!

1048
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:17,358
What's wrong?
Put 'em up!

1049
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:20,231
Give us
those keys!
Or we'll spread you!

1050
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:22,566
Ahmed, we have
done it again!

1051
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:33,032
I don't get this setup.
What's frying?

1052
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:35,042
I'm cooking up
some small sabotage.

1053
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:37,874
We'll have 'em at one
another's throats!
Internal dissension.

1054
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:40,380
Divide and conquer.
Brother against brother.

1055
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:42,610
Sort of an
Arabian Gestapo?

1056
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:44,982
You've got it, Tyrone.
Hasn't missed yet.

1057
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:47,715
Then we grab
the gals and cut out.

1058
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:51,021
Hold this a minute,
will ya?
Allez!

1059
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:04,503
What are you gonna
do with that?
Look and learn.

1060
01:14:10,546 --> 01:14:14,038
What're you doing?
Making reefers?

1061
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:17,051
This'll give 'em
that lift.

1062
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,349
I got a pip.

1063

1064
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,421
Brilliant! Good boy.
Where's the dribble-glass?

Neb-Jolla, so great
is my joy that I wish
to share it with you.

1068
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:22,807
May our tribes live
together in peace
for a thousand years!

1069
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:25,149
My hand on that,
Kassim.

1070
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:28,451
You are fortunate indeed
to win the love of so
beautiful a princess.

1071
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:31,584
She cannot wait for
my kisses upon her lips.

Can you,
my dove?

1073
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:37,559
Kassim, you shall soon know
how I feel about you.

1074

There,
you hear?
Yeah.

1075

I drink to my friend
who was my enemy,

and to the eternal peace
that has come between us.

1077

I drink to that,

and also to the beauty
of my bride-to-be.

My apologies,
O Great Sheik.

1080
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:19,707
There must be a hole
in the goblet.
Yes, I see there is!

1081
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:22,243
I trust you do not
do this as a joke?

1082
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:25,007
No, my friend,
my very dear friend!

1083

Happy Fourth of July.

My friend, I give
you my assurances.

Eat, drink, music!

1087
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:02,606
Let us all be
like brothers.

1088
01:17:10,759 --> 01:17:13,694
Do you bring us here
to make fools of us?

1089
01:17:13,762 --> 01:17:16,060
This is no
doing of mine.

1090
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:19,157
Be of good faith.
There will be no more.

1091
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:25,606
Kassim, when will
these outrages cease?

1092
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:28,040
Neb-Jolla,
please, patience.

1093
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:31,170
I humble myself
at your feet in apology.

Come, sit down.

1095
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:38,080
This is the screwiest
picture I was ever in!

1096
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:08,781
At the word from our master,
we would tear you to shreds!

1097
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,250
We are as
mystified as you.

1098
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:14,686
We came here to eat,
not to be mystified!

1099
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:20,258
Do not trust him.

1100
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:22,796
His is an empty
gesture of friendship.

1101

01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:39,710
Why do you persist on
playing these pranks?

[ Aide ]
It's just as much
a surprise to us.

Please forget about
the whole thing.

I give you
my assurance--

1108
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:49,117
I am trying to
control myself,

but my patience
cannot last!

When I see how
silly people behave,

I'm glad I'm a camel.

You got another one?
Yeah.

It won't be long
before we're seeing
little old New York.

Three years we've been
waiting to get back.

1129

I'm gonna grab a piece
of the U.S.A. and eat it--
something around New Orleans.

Looks like
I trapped you again.

This time I'm bringing
home the bacon too.
And what a slab!

Then the answer's yes?
Yes, but don't think I'm
marrying you for her money.

1134

Why are you
marrying me?
I'll think of something.

1135
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:02,117
I want the Statue of Liberty
to be proud of me,
