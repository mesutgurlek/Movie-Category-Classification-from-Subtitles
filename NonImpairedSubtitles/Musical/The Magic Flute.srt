1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,700
THE MAGIC FLUTE

2
00:07:03,927 --> 00:07:05,918
Help me, help me, Lord!

3
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:08,237
Christ, protect me!

4
00:07:08,237 --> 00:07:11,683
Help me, help me, Lord!
Can not protect anyone?

5
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:15,520
They sent the Angel of Death
to kill me

6
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,645
Did not anyone hear me?

7
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,801
I feel his warm breath,

8
00:07:23,087 --> 00:07:25,885
the smell of death,

9
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:28,960
Redeem me, help me,

10
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,038
someone help me

11
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:34,404
Nobody can help me?

12
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:37,525
Death haunts me,

13
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:39,723
Angel of Death

14
00:07:39,723 --> 00:07:43,357
back to hell

15
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:47,326
Believe us,

16
00:07:49,407 --> 00:07:53,195
trust us, everything goes well,

17
00:07:53,195 --> 00:07:56,120
The snake is dead

18
00:07:57,607 --> 00:08:00,075
The beast has failed

19
00:08:00,927 --> 00:08:03,122
the boy was saved,

20
00:08:03,527 --> 00:08:07,202
Our female power

21
00:08:07,202 --> 00:08:10,006
have prevailed,

22
00:08:10,287 --> 00:08:13,802
Our female power

23
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:16,880
have succeeded,

24
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:31,440
How sweet youth
so tender and strong,

25
00:08:34,407 --> 00:08:38,400
Such innocence
can do no wrong

26
00:08:40,647 --> 00:08:44,640
Such beauty does not last long

27
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:49,920
My heart rejoices

28
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:55,040
to see this guy so handsome

29
00:08:56,127 --> 00:09:00,120
looking at this guy so sweet

30
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:06,604
Fast, small,
let's tell our lady

31
00:09:06,604 --> 00:09:10,237
we have seen
extraordinary,

32
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:14,760
Perhaps this good-looking man

33
00:09:15,647 --> 00:09:18,445
will make her laugh

34
00:09:18,445 --> 00:09:21,997
and smile again

35
00:09:21,997 --> 00:09:25,045
will make her laugh

36
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:28,165
and smile again

37
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:34,199
Tell her this finding as
splendid, I think I stay,

38
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:37,837
Id you, I'm me

39
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:40,237
No, no, run ye
I already took care of him,

40
00:09:40,237 --> 00:09:41,806
I think I stay,

41
00:09:41,806 --> 00:09:43,116
I'll stay longer,

42
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,879
Let him in my hands,

43
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,241
I remain,

44
00:09:46,241 --> 00:09:47,840
I watch him,

45
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,122
We care,

46
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:49,372
I

47
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:50,617
I

48
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:51,457
I

49
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:56,643
They think I'm going to go,

50
00:09:56,643 --> 00:09:57,762
They think I'm going to go,

51
00:09:57,762 --> 00:09:59,280
They think I'm going to go,

52
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:02,603
They think I'm going to go,

53
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:03,483
They think I'm going to go,

54
00:10:03,483 --> 00:10:05,285
They think I'm going to go,

55
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:11,604
We'll see,

56
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:12,483
We'll see,

57
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:14,797
We'll see,

58
00:10:15,607 --> 00:10:18,201
I want to be alone with this guy,

59
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,959
Alone with him,

60
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:20,843
No, no,

61
00:10:20,843 --> 00:10:21,644
No, no,

62
00:10:21,644 --> 00:10:22,444
No, no,

63
00:10:22,444 --> 00:10:26,395
No, no, it can be

64
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:29,998
I want to be alone with this guy,

65
00:10:29,998 --> 00:10:32,806
Alone with him,

66
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:34,477
No, no,

67
00:10:34,477 --> 00:10:35,397
No, no,

68
00:10:35,397 --> 00:10:36,204
No, no,

69
00:10:36,204 --> 00:10:39,325
No, no, it can be

70
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:50,046
I would give my fortune,

71
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:51,526
I would give my fortune,

72
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:52,676
I would give my fortune,

73
00:10:52,676 --> 00:10:54,246
To be alone with him

74
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:55,965
To be alone with him

75
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:57,276
To be alone with him

76
00:10:57,276 --> 00:10:58,357
To have this beauty to me

77
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,721
To have this beauty to me

78
00:10:59,721 --> 00:11:01,559
To have this beauty to me

79
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,796
Yes, for me,

80
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:05,845
But here we are,

81
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:08,362
here we are and can not be

82
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:09,801
I say goodbye, king of men,

83
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:11,002
I say goodbye, king of men,

84
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:14,000
I say goodbye, king of men,
I say goodbye, king of men,

85
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,847
King of men,

86
00:11:20,007 --> 00:11:22,999
My dream of happiness, I say goodbye,

87
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:26,557
Dear boy, stay there

88
00:11:26,557 --> 00:11:29,799
until we meet again,

89
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,480
Goodbye,

90
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,126
until then

91
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:33,958
love,

92
00:11:34,287 --> 00:11:38,075
Until we meet again,

93
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:42,440
until we meet again,

94
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:50,484
My eyes fill with tears,

95
00:11:50,484 --> 00:11:54,037
what grace so tender,
makes me mourn,

96
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:57,597
Adieu, AufWiedersehen,

97
00:11:57,597 --> 00:11:59,086
Goodbye,

98
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:00,885
Until then

99
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:06,240
Until we meet again,

100
00:12:06,447 --> 00:12:10,440
we meet again,

101
00:12:10,727 --> 00:12:13,878
Until we meet again,

102
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:17,767
We meet again,

103
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,285
Until we meet again,

104
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,396
Adieu, AufWiedersehen,

105
00:12:25,247 --> 00:12:25,963
Adieu,

106
00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:28,083
AufWiedersehen,

107
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:30,563
Adieu, AufWiedersehen,

108
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:52,925
Where am I?

109
00:13:04,647 --> 00:13:07,639
The birds are fine.
The trench is clear.

110
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:32,926
The work of the fowler
not completed

111
00:13:32,926 --> 00:13:35,806
edge of dawn
until the sun sets,

112
00:13:35,806 --> 00:13:38,686
In slavery ungrateful

113
00:13:38,686 --> 00:13:41,566
works to protect the young,

114
00:13:44,247 --> 00:13:46,966
Food and dome these copier,

115
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:51,120
amount put traps and nets,

116
00:13:54,527 --> 00:13:57,246
I speak perfect pigeon

117
00:13:57,246 --> 00:14:00,126
and I come down
birds in the trees,

118
00:14:05,687 --> 00:14:08,406
The birder must love
their birds

119
00:14:08,406 --> 00:14:11,286
and soothe
with sweet words,

120
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:14,166
Escape from the cage
wander,

121
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:17,046
but they always return home

122
00:14:19,687 --> 00:14:22,406
I see a couple of birds

123
00:14:22,406 --> 00:14:26,560
and fills my heart
thoughts of love,

124
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:32,846
If the girls were more
like birds

125
00:14:32,846 --> 00:14:35,726
would all be friends of mine,

126
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,166
If a girl to be my love

127
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,046
would leave the ground
and fly through the heights

128
00:14:47,046 --> 00:14:50,199
'd Fly over
tired of this world

129
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:52,757
and graze the sky with wings

130
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,406
'd Fly and trinary
everywhere

131
00:14:58,406 --> 00:15:02,560
and then would land
gently

132
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:09,679
Ylenta and sweetly
my dove sing

133
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,566
well suited
under the wing of the fowler,

134
00:15:18,847 --> 00:15:20,166
My God!

135
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,124
Where did you saIido?

136
00:15:22,124 --> 00:15:23,640
Where are we?

137
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,126
Here, I guess. Work here.

138
00:15:25,126 --> 00:15:26,037
Do you work?

139
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:28,198
Bucket Queen birds to Ia.

140
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:30,518
"The queen? What queen?

141
00:15:30,518 --> 00:15:33,406
What queen?
As the Queen of the Night.

142
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:36,724
Is this a dream?

143
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:41,484
Do not get weird.
Do not approach. I have my tactics.

144
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:45,395
Do I have redeemed you?

145
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:47,885
Is it still peIigroso?

146
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:49,844
How I can make it up?

147
00:15:50,327 --> 00:15:51,885
It was nothing.

148
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:55,557
When I see someone in trouble
helped him. Nothing happens.

149
00:15:55,557 --> 00:15:59,037
"PeIigro? Io I do not know what it means.

150
00:15:59,037 --> 00:16:00,276
Papageno!

151
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,157
No. .. I did not want ... Really ...

152
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:07,041
So learn
to lie to strangers.

153
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,596
Well, learn
not to lie to strangers.

154
00:16:09,596 --> 00:16:11,837
Have you Saiva you?

155
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,838
No. Who was it?

156
00:16:17,047 --> 00:16:18,924
Exact us.

157
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:22,117
You have saved us, young man.

158
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:25,006
And we bring you a message
queen.

159
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:26,236
In person.

160
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,363
You gotta see this.

161
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:29,722
Mirai well.

162
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:36,966
Goodbye, Tamino.

163
00:16:38,327 --> 00:16:39,919
Return.

164
00:16:51,607 --> 00:16:55,600
This picture breaks my heart

165
00:16:57,807 --> 00:17:01,595
Who is this girl?
Who is it? Who?

166
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,737
Never

167
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:10,520
I had thought

168
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,757
that love could cry

169
00:17:12,757 --> 00:17:14,077
the wounded

170
00:17:17,647 --> 00:17:21,037
on the battlefield

171
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,927
the wounded

172
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:30,475
on the battlefield

173
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:41,126
This feeling is

174
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,879
as dying,

175
00:17:43,287 --> 00:17:46,643
I notice that my senses

176
00:17:46,643 --> 00:17:47,393
fly

177
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:53,076
and this feeling

178
00:17:53,076 --> 00:17:55,807
my heart,

179
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:59,476
but this feeling

180
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:03,166
it elevates my heart

181
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:07,839
Those eyes

182
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:10,207
I tear,

183
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:17,357
It tears me apart

184
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:20,875
and looks at me

185
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:25,246
It tears me apart

186
00:18:28,887 --> 00:18:29,607
heart,

187
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:38,123
While this vision

188
00:18:38,123 --> 00:18:39,373
is me

189
00:18:42,327 --> 00:18:43,442
love

190
00:18:43,442 --> 00:18:47,600
I broke out inside

191
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,884
ever

192
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:55,164
never

193
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:56,767
find exit

194
00:18:59,407 --> 00:19:01,716
never cease,

195
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:09,040
But when we meet,

196
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:12,644
this happy sadness

197
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:14,839
encegadora this darkness,

198
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:17,805
this lucid insanity

199
00:19:21,087 --> 00:19:21,807
become

200
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:28,000
in perfect peace,

201
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:31,607
become

202
00:19:35,887 --> 00:19:38,959
in perfect peace,

203
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:42,167
become

204
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:49,440
in perfect peace,

205
00:19:50,407 --> 00:19:50,657
a

206
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:56,520
perfect peace

207
00:19:56,887 --> 00:19:57,137
a

208
00:19:59,607 --> 00:20:02,997
perfect peace

209
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,237
Pamina.

210
00:20:16,237 --> 00:20:18,875
Pamina. Pamina. Pamina.

211
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,196
Pamina.

212
00:20:20,196 --> 00:20:22,961
"The queen has heard you.
"I have become your words.

213
00:20:22,961 --> 00:20:25,766
It was fantastic.
A beautiful song.

214
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,522
''If this young man,''said the queen,
''Is brave and passionate,

215
00:20:29,522 --> 00:20:32,201
saive perhaps a poor Ia Pamina.''

216
00:20:32,201 --> 00:20:34,005
- Saving?
-Save.

217
00:20:34,005 --> 00:20:35,236
Where?

218
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:39,315
Sarastro has kidnapped.
It is powerful and evil.

219
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:40,716
It idler.

220
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:42,958
"Get ready.
"He comes the queen.

221
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:05,006
Do not be afraid

222
00:21:05,527 --> 00:21:06,777
dear,

223
00:21:12,247 --> 00:21:15,000
Are pure,

224
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,922
loyal and strong,

225
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:29,364
You have to believe

226
00:21:29,364 --> 00:21:32,599
in your purity and tufuerza

227
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:36,836
to save the pain

228
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:39,999
the heart of this poor mother

229
00:21:49,087 --> 00:21:53,080
The Queen of Pain

230
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:57,004
kneel before you

231
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:02,960
without her daughter

232
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,210
next,

233
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:09,158
Free her now

234
00:22:09,158 --> 00:22:12,637
I begged my heart

235
00:22:12,637 --> 00:22:14,923
free her now

236
00:22:14,923 --> 00:22:17,555
I begged my heart

237
00:22:18,767 --> 00:22:20,962
An evil,

238
00:22:24,607 --> 00:22:25,447
an evil

239
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:32,437
stolen from her daughter,

240
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:37,160
The beast has caught infamous

241
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:43,000
my innocent daughter,

242
00:22:44,647 --> 00:22:45,966
What tears

243
00:22:45,966 --> 00:22:50,120
great pain and shock,

244
00:22:50,447 --> 00:22:53,359
What a shame, what shouts

245
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:56,246
and what tremors,

246
00:22:57,207 --> 00:22:59,846
Before my eyes

247
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:02,646
she has been taken,

248
00:23:02,646 --> 00:23:03,896
Help!

249
00:23:06,087 --> 00:23:07,337
Help!

250
00:23:11,087 --> 00:23:14,397
Terrified screaming:

251
00:23:15,087 --> 00:23:16,839
Mother'',

252
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,440
save me,''

253
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,640
cry again,

254
00:23:23,807 --> 00:23:24,527
Wanted

255
00:23:25,927 --> 00:23:27,177
help,

256
00:23:30,847 --> 00:23:34,840
but to no avail,

257
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:41,807
Wanted

258
00:23:43,407 --> 00:23:44,657
help,

259
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,997
I wanted to help,

260
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:53,637
but has been

261
00:23:53,637 --> 00:23:54,477
in vain

262
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:04,279
You, you, you,

263
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:08,326
you go, this crazy Liberal,

264
00:24:08,527 --> 00:24:12,520
pull it out from between his claws,

265
00:24:13,927 --> 00:24:17,920
and if saved from their clutches

266
00:24:20,247 --> 00:24:21,327
see it as

267
00:24:23,887 --> 00:24:27,197
command him to be yours

268
00:24:27,607 --> 00:24:29,757
it will command,

269
00:24:53,007 --> 00:24:53,847
Forever

270
00:24:55,767 --> 00:24:56,727
be yours

271
00:24:59,087 --> 00:24:59,927
forever

272
00:25:22,727 --> 00:25:24,319
Wherever you are,

273
00:25:25,647 --> 00:25:27,365
I will find you.

274
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,562
Be still and fix,

275
00:25:37,562 --> 00:25:39,957
Seem to carry a lock,

276
00:25:44,247 --> 00:25:46,397
Is very strong, I can not let go,

277
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:48,762
seems to have stuck,

278
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:51,763
The lock is jammed,

279
00:25:52,007 --> 00:25:53,725
I can not open,

280
00:25:54,247 --> 00:25:57,842
It appears that you have to live silent

281
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,286
Would help,

282
00:26:01,087 --> 00:26:04,762
but the lock is jammed
You seem to have bad luck

283
00:26:06,007 --> 00:26:08,157
The Queen has sent three

284
00:26:08,157 --> 00:26:10,602
to take off the mask
and freeing,

285
00:26:12,807 --> 00:26:14,604
Hear, Papageno speech

286
00:26:15,047 --> 00:26:17,117
Remember, do not forget
what it means,

287
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,517
Liars, fools
and those who boast

288
00:26:19,517 --> 00:26:21,757
spend their days
with the mouth closed

289
00:26:21,757 --> 00:26:23,565
Spend their days
with the mouth closed

290
00:26:23,565 --> 00:26:26,799
Spend their days
with the mouth closed

291
00:26:28,247 --> 00:26:29,839
If the wicked

292
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:32,120
who boast and lie

293
00:26:32,687 --> 00:26:36,316
they could be close
mouth forever

294
00:26:36,687 --> 00:26:40,202
hatred and war would disappear

295
00:26:41,847 --> 00:26:45,237
and men would live in harmony,

296
00:26:46,047 --> 00:26:48,880
Hatred and war will disappear

297
00:26:51,327 --> 00:26:55,036
and men would live in harmony,

298
00:26:59,047 --> 00:27:01,641
Dear, for you

299
00:27:01,641 --> 00:27:04,082
with all our love

300
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:07,796
we bring a gift
of our queen,

301
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:12,439
This flute will give you strength
and weapons

302
00:27:14,207 --> 00:27:16,846
if you attack
evil or misfortune,

303
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:20,598
His music has the power magic

304
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:23,998
to flourish
a barren desert

305
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:28,925
becomes king,

306
00:27:29,807 --> 00:27:33,800
and the world
he sings,

307
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:39,277
This magical treasure

308
00:27:39,277 --> 00:27:41,278
is better than fame

309
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:43,119
or gold mundane

310
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,721
its magic cure

311
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:48,321
healing human wounds

312
00:27:48,321 --> 00:27:52,480
and gives love to the world,

313
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:57,040
Gives love to the world

314
00:27:57,807 --> 00:28:01,800
Gives love to the world

315
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:06,722
Gosh, how time flies,

316
00:28:07,327 --> 00:28:08,760
I think

317
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,201
I have to dismiss,

318
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:12,756
Do not even think,

319
00:28:13,007 --> 00:28:15,157
The two, without further delay

320
00:28:15,157 --> 00:28:17,318
Go to the home of Sarastro,

321
00:28:17,607 --> 00:28:19,325
are actual orders,

322
00:28:19,325 --> 00:28:22,160
Thanks, but no,
I think I stay,

323
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,636
I will live to fight another day

324
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,763
Sarastro is a barbarian,

325
00:28:26,763 --> 00:28:29,077
will my brains for dinner
will cook my kidneys,

326
00:28:29,077 --> 00:28:30,965
fry my guts
my blood boil,

327
00:28:30,965 --> 00:28:33,800
roast my crop,
Grilled Papageno!

328
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,162
Tamino will protect,

329
00:28:36,162 --> 00:28:38,921
obey him and serve him in return,

330
00:28:38,921 --> 00:28:41,237
May this hero
I had not known

331
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:43,962
Love my life

332
00:28:43,962 --> 00:28:46,243
I will not die until you are ready,

333
00:28:46,243 --> 00:28:49,126
let me live another year

334
00:28:51,447 --> 00:28:53,802
Here, take this, you'll like,

335
00:28:54,127 --> 00:28:56,561
For me?
What will be in hiding?

336
00:28:56,561 --> 00:28:58,797
Inside you'll hear tinkling silver,

337
00:28:58,797 --> 00:29:01,356
I do not sound,

338
00:29:02,047 --> 00:29:04,083
And you get the hang of,
Learn to make it sound,

339
00:29:04,287 --> 00:29:06,596
The silver bells,

340
00:29:06,887 --> 00:29:09,037
mystical music,

341
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:10,087
Safely

342
00:29:11,887 --> 00:29:14,082
armed struggle,

343
00:29:14,447 --> 00:29:16,403
See you soon,

344
00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:18,757
We'll meet again,

345
00:29:19,447 --> 00:29:21,438
We're leaving,

346
00:29:21,438 --> 00:29:23,837
Until then,

347
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:26,357
See you soon,

348
00:29:26,357 --> 00:29:28,483
AufWiedersehen,

349
00:29:28,483 --> 00:29:31,002
Now we know who,
but do not know where,

350
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:33,283
How do I find
the monster's lair?

351
00:29:34,887 --> 00:29:38,482
How do I find
Sarastro's lair?

352
00:29:57,767 --> 00:29:59,917
Come three children

353
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:03,204
beautiful and smart,

354
00:30:03,204 --> 00:30:05,722

355
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:08,526
in this dark mission

356
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,077
We will show the way

357
00:30:11,077 --> 00:30:14,205
where to go,

358
00:30:17,207 --> 00:30:19,596
where you lead,

359
00:30:19,596 --> 00:30:21,758
Come three children

360
00:30:21,758 --> 00:30:24,521
beautiful and smart,

361
00:30:24,521 --> 00:30:26,996
that will guide you

362
00:30:26,996 --> 00:30:29,362
in this dark mission

363
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:32,316
We will show the way

364
00:30:32,527 --> 00:30:34,836
where to go,

365
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:37,881
Keep children

366
00:30:37,881 --> 00:30:39,958
where you lead,

367
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:42,756
For until then,

368
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:45,245
Meet again,

369
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:47,079
Goodbye,

370
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:50,239
until then, aufWiedersehen,

371
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:53,161
Until then, boys,

372
00:30:53,967 --> 00:30:55,446
meet again,

373
00:30:55,446 --> 00:30:57,996
Bye, bye,

374
00:30:57,996 --> 00:31:00,806
aufWiedersehen.

375
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:03,595
AufWiedersehen.

376
00:31:03,927 --> 00:31:06,395
Meet again,

377
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:08,956
Meet again,

378
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,006
AufWiedersehen.

379
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,721
Dear child, come with me

380
00:31:21,721 --> 00:31:24,560
Can not save anyone?
Nobody sees me?

381
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,036
Fly your last hours

382
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:29,927
Do not fear death,

383
00:31:30,207 --> 00:31:33,836
But the sweet heart of my mother

384
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:36,841
be broken

385
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:39,521
If I die,

386
00:31:39,521 --> 00:31:42,520
You, idiot, tie and go,

387
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,076
My passion will overcome them

388
00:31:45,076 --> 00:31:48,080
Death set me free,

389
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,040
not live

390
00:31:51,687 --> 00:31:53,757
save me,

391
00:31:54,127 --> 00:31:56,243
lmbéciles, come out,

392
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:59,317
leave me alone with her,

393
00:32:06,567 --> 00:32:08,205
Where am I?

394
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:10,919
Where I can be?,

395
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,405
It seems that there are people

396
00:32:15,647 --> 00:32:18,115
Be brave, come to see,

397
00:32:23,847 --> 00:32:26,077
As a princess, so sleepy,

398
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:29,406
with skin
as white as paper,

399
00:32:33,527 --> 00:32:34,027
Is

400
00:32:35,047 --> 00:32:38,676
the devil, no doubt,

401
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:41,722
It is no angel

402
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:44,277
I want to leave,

403
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:46,395
Have mercy,

404
00:32:46,395 --> 00:32:47,886
Have mercy,

405
00:32:47,886 --> 00:32:49,036
Let me out,

406
00:32:49,407 --> 00:32:50,965
Let me out,

407
00:33:08,127 --> 00:33:09,116
Sorry.

408
00:33:14,807 --> 00:33:15,956
Who are you?

409
00:33:17,207 --> 00:33:19,357
CáImate and pushes that.

410
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:22,561
Is to open messages,
no messengers.

411
00:33:22,561 --> 00:33:24,638
- Are you a messenger?
"From the queen herself.

412
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:25,637
My mother?

413
00:33:26,527 --> 00:33:28,324
- Who are you?
"Papageno.

414
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:30,925
What more beautiful place.

415
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:34,804
Well?

416
00:33:35,127 --> 00:33:35,923
I'm fine.

417
00:33:35,923 --> 00:33:37,600
- Your message!
"Oh, yes.

418
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,282
He was with the pigeons, as always,
and suddenly a man.

419
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:45,164
These three ladies who your mother
sent to spy on the poor people

420
00:33:45,164 --> 00:33:47,682
Tamino see
and show him a picture of you.

421
00:33:47,682 --> 00:33:49,997
He looks y. ..

422
00:33:53,287 --> 00:33:57,246
Shock. Thunder and lightning.
You know what I mean?

423
00:33:57,767 --> 00:34:00,281
Tamino "I want?

424
00:34:02,487 --> 00:34:03,886
Why not come?

425
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:05,436
Well ...

426
00:34:05,887 --> 00:34:08,037
I am the vanguard.

427
00:34:08,037 --> 00:34:10,243
Paved the way, if you want.

428
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:13,486
You say that an unknown

429
00:34:13,486 --> 00:34:16,445
is in love with me for a portrait?

430
00:34:16,445 --> 00:34:18,086
As sure as I'm here.

431
00:34:18,086 --> 00:34:20,203
"It's nonsense.
"I've seen worse.

432
00:34:20,203 --> 00:34:24,246
Once I saw a girl back
and I fell in love.

433
00:34:24,847 --> 00:34:26,326
Will be five years.

434
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,797
Love at first sight.
Really.

435
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,646
- Yes?
"Yes, Ciara. Yes

436
00:34:30,646 --> 00:34:32,798
If I did I saw was beautiful.

437
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:35,556
I heard his voice and saw how he was.

438
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:39,197
I have not think of another.
Five years ago.

439
00:34:39,887 --> 00:34:41,286
Poor thing.

440
00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:43,603
Well.

441
00:34:44,927 --> 00:34:47,566
In life there are other things
apart from love.

442
00:34:48,207 --> 00:34:49,003
No.

443
00:34:49,727 --> 00:34:51,445
No, you're wrong.

444
00:34:56,967 --> 00:35:00,039
If you, my friend

445
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:03,517
feel such a longing

446
00:35:03,517 --> 00:35:07,157
thou shalt not fear

447
00:35:07,157 --> 00:35:10,205
Living alone

448
00:35:10,205 --> 00:35:13,439
But feeling

449
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:16,963
how to return the love

450
00:35:16,963 --> 00:35:18,043
find love

451
00:35:20,607 --> 00:35:23,599
that is mine,

452
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:27,397
We hope you love

453
00:35:27,397 --> 00:35:30,843
We heal the soul

454
00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:33,916
because only love

455
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:37,318
we can complete,

456
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:40,806
Only love

457
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:44,243
we can complete,

458
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:54,476
True love can heal

459
00:35:54,476 --> 00:35:57,719
our misfortunes,

460
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:58,679
and calm

461
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:04,962
a fevered forehead,

462
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:08,517
Or yesterday

463
00:36:08,517 --> 00:36:09,837
or tomorrow

464
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:13,925
in love

465
00:36:13,925 --> 00:36:17,602
there is only

466
00:36:17,602 --> 00:36:19,246
today,

467
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:22,798
Poets teach

468
00:36:22,798 --> 00:36:26,482
that hope, in life,

469
00:36:27,207 --> 00:36:29,596
is on the other,

470
00:36:30,047 --> 00:36:33,164
husband and wife,

471
00:36:34,087 --> 00:36:36,885
is on the other,

472
00:36:36,885 --> 00:36:40,357
husband and wife,

473
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:47,006
husband and wife,

474
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:53,598
husband and wife,

475
00:36:54,287 --> 00:36:56,562
Husband and wife

476
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:59,924
husband and wife,

477
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:01,617
Going

478
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:06,244
Right hand of God,

479
00:37:06,927 --> 00:37:09,282
Husband and wife

480
00:37:09,282 --> 00:37:12,120
husband and wife,

481
00:37:13,087 --> 00:37:14,337
Going

482
00:37:16,047 --> 00:37:20,040
Right hand of God,

483
00:37:21,927 --> 00:37:23,155
Going

484
00:37:23,155 --> 00:37:26,717
Right hand of God,

485
00:37:29,287 --> 00:37:30,083
Going

486
00:37:30,567 --> 00:37:34,446
Right hand of God,

487
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:04,881
This road leads

488
00:38:04,881 --> 00:38:07,277
where to go,

489
00:38:07,487 --> 00:38:11,480
but listen and obey
our advice,

490
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:16,200
You have to show three virtues:

491
00:38:16,767 --> 00:38:18,644
decision

492
00:38:19,807 --> 00:38:21,286
courage

493
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:23,678
and patience

494
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:27,880
But children, say, give me a sign

495
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:32,760
Pamina "will soon be mine?

496
00:38:34,207 --> 00:38:38,200
We can not
reveal the future

497
00:38:38,727 --> 00:38:40,683
Decision

498
00:38:41,727 --> 00:38:43,046
courage

499
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:45,597
and patience

500
00:38:46,207 --> 00:38:50,200
Heed these words, wrestling,

501
00:38:50,407 --> 00:38:51,407
Know

502
00:38:52,847 --> 00:38:55,315
if the penalty

503
00:38:55,315 --> 00:38:57,955
expected to joy,

504
00:38:58,607 --> 00:38:59,567
to tears

505
00:39:01,607 --> 00:39:04,405
or celebration

506
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,400
Wisdom
of these young angels

507
00:39:18,407 --> 00:39:22,400
guide me
by the dangers ahead,

508
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:24,846
Where am I now?

509
00:39:25,687 --> 00:39:27,166
What is this place?,

510
00:39:27,647 --> 00:39:31,606
Is this where the evil
hide his face?

511
00:39:32,407 --> 00:39:36,195
I imagined a dungeon
dominated by death,

512
00:39:37,047 --> 00:39:39,436
I could not imagine

513
00:39:39,436 --> 00:39:43,566
these signs of wisdom,

514
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:47,119
Neither monsters and ghosts

515
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,676
could scare therefore

516
00:39:49,676 --> 00:39:53,556
A very clever man
and powerful live here

517
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:02,444
My reasons are noble,

518
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:03,244
honest and true,

519
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:11,876
Corre, wild dog,
You can not hide,

520
00:40:12,087 --> 00:40:15,159
Pamina needs me

521
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:18,839
Pamina needs me

522
00:40:19,687 --> 00:40:21,564
at his side,

523
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:29,523
Back!

524
00:40:29,767 --> 00:40:31,120
"Back?

525
00:40:31,607 --> 00:40:32,483
"Back?

526
00:40:33,967 --> 00:40:36,606
We tried the other door

527
00:40:42,087 --> 00:40:43,156
Back!

528
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,996
Back''''say again

529
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:49,036
Return to where it was before

530
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,200
You may find another way

531
00:41:04,207 --> 00:41:06,767
What brings you here

532
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:09,646
young bleeding?

533
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,597
What brings you

534
00:41:12,597 --> 00:41:15,042
to this sacred place?

535
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:19,200
I've come to rescue

536
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,360
the love and grace

537
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:27,560
What words so splendid
how well they sound,

538
00:41:28,647 --> 00:41:30,638
I do not know

539
00:41:30,638 --> 00:41:34,436
How dare you say them,

540
00:41:35,047 --> 00:41:37,607
Neither love nor grace

541
00:41:37,607 --> 00:41:40,361
shine on you,

542
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,926
Revenge and murder

543
00:41:43,926 --> 00:41:46,555
burn within you,

544
00:41:46,555 --> 00:41:48,877
I am angry with a beast!

545
00:41:48,877 --> 00:41:50,799
You will not find animals

546
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:54,642
in this house

547
00:41:54,642 --> 00:41:57,879
Do you live Sarastro in this fortress?

548
00:41:58,247 --> 00:41:58,997
Yes

549
00:42:00,207 --> 00:42:04,200
Sarastro lives here

550
00:42:04,487 --> 00:42:07,877
Between these walls mystics?

551
00:42:08,607 --> 00:42:12,395
This is the realm of Sarastro.

552
00:42:12,887 --> 00:42:13,967
Then, all

553
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,086
is a big lie

554
00:42:20,727 --> 00:42:24,515
"Once you go?

555
00:42:26,887 --> 00:42:28,878
Yes, I have to go,

556
00:42:29,127 --> 00:42:31,357
Separate,

557
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,604
Air!

558
00:42:33,604 --> 00:42:35,962
Give me the fresh air of God

559
00:42:38,887 --> 00:42:41,879
What do you mean?,

560
00:42:42,967 --> 00:42:45,401
Explain to me

561
00:42:45,401 --> 00:42:47,558
Sarastro is the king of this place

562
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:50,606
There is nothing more to say

563
00:42:51,767 --> 00:42:54,281
Do not go so fast

564
00:42:54,281 --> 00:42:56,324
A moment

565
00:42:56,727 --> 00:42:58,604
Answer me,

566
00:42:59,207 --> 00:43:02,438
"Sarastro you care?

567
00:43:02,438 --> 00:43:04,677
I will hate you forever

568
00:43:04,677 --> 00:43:08,078
Andof "why?

569
00:43:08,807 --> 00:43:12,277
It is a poison, a disgrace,

570
00:43:13,287 --> 00:43:14,925
What sockets

571
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:19,080
such accusations?

572
00:43:20,527 --> 00:43:22,916
In this war

573
00:43:22,916 --> 00:43:25,043
and the devastation

574
00:43:25,607 --> 00:43:29,077
a mother cries

575
00:43:29,077 --> 00:43:31,238
by her daughter,

576
00:43:31,847 --> 00:43:33,405
Poor thing,

577
00:43:33,405 --> 00:43:36,923
you have deceived your senses,

578
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:41,160
The Queen has poisoned you

579
00:43:41,487 --> 00:43:43,079
mind,

580
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:45,597
I have become deaf,

581
00:43:45,597 --> 00:43:48,486
you have been blinded

582
00:43:49,767 --> 00:43:51,758
Sarastro,

583
00:43:52,127 --> 00:43:55,403
if you were here

584
00:43:55,847 --> 00:43:59,840
could explain their reasons

585
00:44:00,607 --> 00:44:03,838
The reasons are
lighter than water,

586
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:06,567
Will the wily snake

587
00:44:06,567 --> 00:44:10,356
Pamina not caught and locked?

588
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:12,166
Yes, soldier,

589
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:14,397
what you say is true,

590
00:44:15,367 --> 00:44:16,846
Where?

591
00:44:17,247 --> 00:44:19,477
Do not accept evasive

592
00:44:20,007 --> 00:44:21,679
By God,

593
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:25,840
Do not tell me
it's too late,

594
00:44:28,487 --> 00:44:30,443
Is prohibited,

595
00:44:30,443 --> 00:44:33,246
Estimated Young

596
00:44:33,927 --> 00:44:37,920
I can not tell yet,

597
00:44:39,047 --> 00:44:41,880
Das many turns, tell me now,

598
00:44:42,607 --> 00:44:45,167
I can not help,

599
00:44:45,167 --> 00:44:48,956
wait and see,

600
00:44:49,727 --> 00:44:53,083
When will I get

601
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:54,043
Answers?

602
00:44:57,607 --> 00:45:01,566
At the time, friend

603
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:04,685
I understand,

604
00:45:04,685 --> 00:45:08,078
at the time you join

605
00:45:08,078 --> 00:45:08,878
our sacred side,

606
00:45:27,967 --> 00:45:31,960
Endless night

607
00:45:32,447 --> 00:45:36,042
devastation,

608
00:45:36,647 --> 00:45:39,798
When will the light

609
00:45:39,798 --> 00:45:43,960
of revelation?

610
00:45:45,927 --> 00:45:47,565
Soon

611
00:45:49,367 --> 00:45:50,641
soon

612
00:45:52,527 --> 00:45:54,518
soldier

613
00:45:57,847 --> 00:46:01,078
at the time,

614
00:46:01,487 --> 00:46:02,556
Will it soon?

615
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:03,757
Will it soon?

616
00:46:04,007 --> 00:46:06,316
"At the time, you say?

617
00:46:06,727 --> 00:46:10,720
But otherwise, answer me,

618
00:46:11,767 --> 00:46:15,760
"The sweet Pamina is alive?

619
00:46:18,047 --> 00:46:18,767
Pamina

620
00:46:24,647 --> 00:46:25,367
Pamina

621
00:46:30,207 --> 00:46:31,167
is alive

622
00:46:33,767 --> 00:46:34,961
It's alive!

623
00:46:35,287 --> 00:46:36,436
It's alive!

624
00:46:36,436 --> 00:46:39,167
I thank you from the heart,

625
00:46:39,447 --> 00:46:42,200
I wish I could show you wealth

626
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,165
they paid the debt
I have with you,

627
00:46:45,165 --> 00:46:49,320
But more than dollars
pounds or francs

628
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,275
it's music, listen

629
00:46:53,847 --> 00:46:55,097
Take,

630
00:46:56,607 --> 00:46:58,563
very grateful

631
00:47:23,447 --> 00:47:26,086
How strong and how pure

632
00:47:26,086 --> 00:47:28,636
your music sounds,

633
00:47:29,687 --> 00:47:33,680
All of nature,

all nature

635
00:47:36,044 --> 00:47:39,324
mesmerized by the flute,

all living beings

637
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,439
dance of joy,

638
00:47:50,687 --> 00:47:52,882
How strong and how pure

639
00:47:52,882 --> 00:47:56,357
your music sounds,

640
00:48:00,807 --> 00:48:03,037
All nature

641
00:48:03,037 --> 00:48:06,961

all living things,,,

But

646
00:48:22,047 --> 00:48:24,356
but Pamina

647
00:48:24,727 --> 00:48:26,797
my Pamina,

648
00:48:26,797 --> 00:48:27,877
still far

649
00:48:30,367 --> 00:48:32,198
My Pamina

650
00:48:32,198 --> 00:48:34,881
still far

651
00:48:38,447 --> 00:48:39,287
Pamina!

652
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,717
Pamina!

653
00:48:46,127 --> 00:48:48,277
Listen!

654
00:48:48,277 --> 00:48:50,563
Where are you?

655
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:58,645
It is useless, it's useless

656
00:49:01,687 --> 00:49:02,278
Where?

657
00:49:04,087 --> 00:49:04,883
Where?

658
00:49:06,647 --> 00:49:10,640
Where do you find then?

659
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:18,437
Is the sound of Papageno

660
00:49:22,407 --> 00:49:24,762
God willing
you've found Pamina

661
00:49:25,487 --> 00:49:28,285
God wants you to know where you are,

662
00:49:28,647 --> 00:49:31,605
God willing,

663
00:49:31,605 --> 00:49:33,045
God willing,

664
00:49:35,687 --> 00:49:37,882
come directly to me,

665
00:49:38,727 --> 00:49:41,560
come directly to me,

666
00:49:41,967 --> 00:49:43,844
God willing

667
00:49:43,844 --> 00:49:46,237
come directly to me,

668
00:49:46,237 --> 00:49:46,957
to me,

669
00:49:51,407 --> 00:49:53,875
Softly, softly,
advanced

670
00:49:54,487 --> 00:49:57,206
fast as fire
fled from the enemy,

671
00:49:57,567 --> 00:50:00,445
Let us quickly
Tamino's feet

672
00:50:00,445 --> 00:50:03,326
or we will kill
kill us in a moment

673
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:06,525
Let us quickly
Tamino's feet

674
00:50:06,525 --> 00:50:09,485
or we will kill
kill us in battle

675
00:50:11,487 --> 00:50:12,715
Tamino!

676
00:50:12,715 --> 00:50:15,685
Listen, listen, listen,
Listen, I call it

677
00:50:22,127 --> 00:50:25,119
Thank heaven
I think we have heard,

678
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,120
Yes, Tamino has heard us play,

679
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,359
I swear, thence

680
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,599
Stop the Pain
and concerns,

681
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:37,565
We must hurry,
We must hurry,

682
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:40,042
Stop the Pain
and concerns,

683
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:42,721
We must hurry,
We must hurry,

684
00:50:42,721 --> 00:50:45,765
We must hurry,
We must hurry,

685
00:50:45,765 --> 00:50:47,406
Come on, move, Come, quick,

686
00:50:47,406 --> 00:50:49,637
Why the rush?
Why the rush?

687
00:50:51,527 --> 00:50:53,802
Why do not you stay a while?

688
00:50:54,287 --> 00:50:56,642
Bring fire
knives and tools

689
00:50:56,642 --> 00:50:59,526
and will teach good manners

690
00:50:59,767 --> 00:51:02,281
You have been caught Monostatos

691
00:51:02,281 --> 00:51:04,677
and soportaréis
a week of torture

692
00:51:04,677 --> 00:51:06,917
Supplicate a simple death,

693
00:51:06,917 --> 00:51:09,362
Is it my last breath?

694
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:12,161
Supplicate a simple death,

695
00:51:12,887 --> 00:51:14,286
My God, I forgot,

696
00:51:14,887 --> 00:51:17,355
I forgot about the bells,

697
00:51:17,355 --> 00:51:19,518
Spread your magic spell,

698
00:51:19,518 --> 00:51:21,643
Your music to sound,
it may sound,

699
00:51:22,007 --> 00:51:24,362
it rolls jingling,
tinkling,

700
00:51:34,287 --> 00:51:36,755
What beautiful music,

701
00:51:37,247 --> 00:51:39,044
so pure and so sweet

702
00:51:44,047 --> 00:51:46,197
I filled the senses

703
00:51:46,197 --> 00:51:48,244
peace magic

704
00:51:53,567 --> 00:51:55,558
I filled the senses

705
00:51:55,967 --> 00:51:57,844
peace magic

706
00:52:05,847 --> 00:52:09,362
If we all had
These bells

707
00:52:09,362 --> 00:52:12,883
enemies disperse

708
00:52:13,207 --> 00:52:16,836
living in a time like this

709
00:52:17,127 --> 00:52:20,722
seems that the power
is important,

710
00:52:20,927 --> 00:52:24,522
But there might be a better world

711
00:52:24,522 --> 00:52:27,679
Made of peace and harmony

712
00:52:27,927 --> 00:52:31,044
Made peace

713
00:52:31,044 --> 00:52:32,484
and harmony,

714
00:52:35,887 --> 00:52:39,482
Made for all
boys and girls

715
00:52:39,687 --> 00:52:43,202
love is its base,

716
00:52:43,487 --> 00:52:47,480
Joy creates this magical world

717
00:52:48,927 --> 00:52:52,920
and the music starts,

718
00:52:58,847 --> 00:53:00,838
Our guide, Sarastro!

719
00:53:00,838 --> 00:53:02,804
Sarastro comes!

720
00:53:03,167 --> 00:53:07,160
God, we are lost!
Sarastro comes!

721
00:53:07,647 --> 00:53:11,640
My God, we are about death,

722
00:53:12,407 --> 00:53:14,637
Sarastro arrives terrible,

723
00:53:14,637 --> 00:53:16,798
I wish it were a mouse,

724
00:53:17,167 --> 00:53:19,237
and run under the floor,

725
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,637
Wish I was a turtle

726
00:53:21,637 --> 00:53:24,196
and I hide in the shell,

727
00:53:24,196 --> 00:53:25,516
Help!

728
00:53:26,727 --> 00:53:30,686
I see no where to hide,

729
00:53:33,327 --> 00:53:35,682
Tell the truth,

730
00:53:36,607 --> 00:53:39,917
Tell the truth,

731
00:53:40,887 --> 00:53:43,447
What sense does it lie?,

732
00:53:53,127 --> 00:53:55,277
Our guide, Sarastro!

733
00:53:55,277 --> 00:53:57,324
The wise Sarastro!

734
00:53:59,247 --> 00:54:01,283
The Flame of Purity

735
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:03,517
and the shield of reason

736
00:54:05,607 --> 00:54:08,326
His wisdom and foresight

737
00:54:08,326 --> 00:54:09,681
save humanity,

738
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:13,840
His wisdom and foresight
save humanity,

739
00:54:14,047 --> 00:54:17,926
Stay with us
and be open

740
00:54:18,767 --> 00:54:21,725
Stay with us
and be open

741
00:54:22,087 --> 00:54:23,406
Be open

742
00:54:24,167 --> 00:54:26,237
Be open

743
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,287
Lord

744
00:54:54,047 --> 00:54:58,040
I kneel in shame,

745
00:54:59,687 --> 00:55:03,236
I wanted to escape from your house

746
00:55:06,047 --> 00:55:07,958
But believe me,

747
00:55:07,958 --> 00:55:11,199
had an excuse,

748
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:13,597
This twisted

749
00:55:14,007 --> 00:55:16,475
wanted to rape me

750
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:18,998
Hui, sir,

751
00:55:18,998 --> 00:55:21,158
their abuse,

752
00:55:21,158 --> 00:55:24,558
The reason he has done

753
00:55:24,558 --> 00:55:25,878
escapes you

754
00:55:29,247 --> 00:55:30,885
I already know,

755
00:55:30,885 --> 00:55:34,244
you need not mourn,

756
00:55:35,247 --> 00:55:35,497
I

757
00:55:37,407 --> 00:55:40,524
the light inside of you

758
00:55:41,767 --> 00:55:42,767
Eyes

759
00:55:44,767 --> 00:55:47,600
you shine with love

760
00:55:50,127 --> 00:55:53,915
You shine with love

761
00:55:54,647 --> 00:55:56,797
Although you can

762
00:55:56,797 --> 00:55:59,162
the heart of love

763
00:55:59,162 --> 00:55:59,912
yet

764
00:56:01,927 --> 00:56:05,397
not set you free,

765
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:08,560
Although you can

766
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:12,242
the heart of love

767
00:56:12,567 --> 00:56:15,127
Moreover,

768
00:56:15,647 --> 00:56:16,397
yet

769
00:56:19,607 --> 00:56:22,405
not set you free,

770
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:25,878
But no

771
00:56:26,727 --> 00:56:28,683
let me see

772
00:56:29,567 --> 00:56:32,035
my sad mother?

773
00:56:32,035 --> 00:56:34,880
Never in life!

774
00:56:35,127 --> 00:56:38,119
Not let you go with it

775
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:42,121
are not safe in their claws,

776
00:56:43,727 --> 00:56:46,605
I miss his touch

777
00:56:46,605 --> 00:56:49,645
loving and tender,

778
00:56:50,247 --> 00:56:52,886
The need,

779
00:56:53,287 --> 00:56:54,007
I need

780
00:56:56,167 --> 00:56:58,965
Never in life!

781
00:57:00,367 --> 00:57:03,086
I beg you to forget

782
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,203
your mother

783
00:57:06,207 --> 00:57:09,279
see your site

784
00:57:09,687 --> 00:57:13,441
is adjacent to this brave young man,

785
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:19,402
I assure you,

786
00:57:23,887 --> 00:57:25,764
Proud soldier, you're dead,

787
00:57:25,764 --> 00:57:28,566
Sarastro has arrived,
lowers his head,

788
00:57:28,927 --> 00:57:29,996
It is well!

789
00:57:29,996 --> 00:57:31,043
It is well!

790
00:57:31,367 --> 00:57:34,200
Can not be true!

791
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,277
You are here!

792
00:57:35,277 --> 00:57:36,675
You are here!

793
00:57:37,607 --> 00:57:38,801
Is that you?

794
00:57:38,801 --> 00:57:41,640
Come, my love, my arms,

795
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,843
Run, my love, my arms,

796
00:57:43,843 --> 00:57:46,475
Now you're here
I have no fear,

797
00:57:46,475 --> 00:57:47,682
How dare they?

798
00:57:47,682 --> 00:57:49,917
Do you dare to profane
this place?,

799
00:57:49,917 --> 00:57:51,486
Show a little respect,

800
00:57:52,407 --> 00:57:54,045
What a shame, what a lewd

801
00:57:56,487 --> 00:57:58,876
The server greets his master,

802
00:57:58,876 --> 00:58:01,607
I saved this girl
disaster,

803
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:03,917
This soldier cheated
with that weirdo,

804
00:58:03,917 --> 00:58:06,317
She has a pure heart,
but weak in spirit,

805
00:58:06,317 --> 00:58:09,559
used black magic
to enslave,

806
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:11,877
But I followed them and saved,

807
00:58:13,527 --> 00:58:16,644
You know me,
I love to serve

808
00:58:16,644 --> 00:58:19,605
Yte deserve a special payment,

809
00:58:21,807 --> 00:58:24,685
You pay
everything you owe,

810
00:58:24,685 --> 00:58:26,917
My reward is to serve,

811
00:58:27,127 --> 00:58:31,120
Degrade you out
that's enough,

812
00:58:32,687 --> 00:58:36,077
But sir, sir,
if I followed all laws,

813
00:58:36,077 --> 00:58:39,319
No, my friend
just follow yours,

814
00:58:39,319 --> 00:58:41,796
Praise Sarastro,

815
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:44,481
All-knowing, all-knowing,

816
00:58:44,727 --> 00:58:48,561
overflows justice, mercy and love,

817
00:58:52,927 --> 00:58:56,715
Pass out there
destiny awaits you,

818
00:58:56,967 --> 00:59:00,960
started when
test,

819
00:59:03,527 --> 00:59:06,439
Raise your head

820
00:59:06,439 --> 00:59:10,600
and walk with pride

821
00:59:11,327 --> 00:59:13,636
your search

822
00:59:13,636 --> 00:59:14,716
is beyond

823
00:59:19,207 --> 00:59:20,207
sun,

824
00:59:23,167 --> 00:59:26,125
When virtue
force meets

825
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:29,685
the golden path
to love and truth

826
00:59:29,685 --> 00:59:31,803
the golden path
to love and truth

827
00:59:31,803 --> 00:59:32,956
love and truth

828
00:59:32,956 --> 00:59:36,358
brings man to greater heights,

829
00:59:36,358 --> 00:59:39,724
brings man to greater heights,

830
00:59:39,724 --> 00:59:41,559
and turns the Earth into a paradise,

831
00:59:42,487 --> 00:59:45,126
and turns the Earth into a paradise,

832
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:49,165
brings man to greater heights

833
00:59:49,165 --> 00:59:51,124
and turns the Earth into a paradise,

834
00:59:51,124 --> 00:59:53,164
brings man to greater heights,

835
00:59:53,164 --> 00:59:55,966
and turns the Earth into a paradise,

836
00:59:55,966 --> 00:59:58,960
and turns the Earth into a paradise,

837
00:59:59,967 --> 01:00:02,765
and turns the Earth into a paradise,

838
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:06,237
Eden, Eden,

839
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:07,937
Eden,

840
01:00:52,807 --> 01:00:55,480
Are you willing to spend
all the tests?

841
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,558
I do it for love.

842
01:00:57,927 --> 01:00:59,565
The reward is peace.

843
01:01:07,287 --> 01:01:08,720
I do it for love.

844
01:01:16,687 --> 01:01:18,564
He does it for her.

845
01:01:18,927 --> 01:01:22,044
"We're using.
"I ask you to risk your life.

846
01:01:22,847 --> 01:01:24,758
We have no other option.

847
01:01:27,807 --> 01:01:29,798
Do you know tell you what you doing?

848
01:01:33,527 --> 01:01:35,085
I hope so.

849
01:01:36,447 --> 01:01:39,519
Tamino has achieved.

850
01:01:40,687 --> 01:01:43,326
This slaughter must end.

851
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,927
We can not wait.

852
01:03:26,847 --> 01:03:27,687
Spirits

853
01:03:30,127 --> 01:03:34,006
