00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:25,535
SANTA:
This is Christmastown in the North Pole.

2
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,430
One of the things you need to know
is that everyone who lives here...

3
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,406
is happy all the time. Really happy.

4
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:35,808
I mean, really, really happy.

5
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,609
Honestly, sometimes it's a bit much.

6
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,979
But happiest of all was Buddy the Elf.

7
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:46,284
Well, he wasn't really an elf,
but we'll get to that later.

8
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:50,023
(SINGING) Christmas elves enjoy themselves
By donning gay apparel

9
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,322
Or by singing songs in Santa's shop

10
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:53,759
Fa-la-la, la-la, la-la-la

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,477
Of course, I always like it
When they sing a Christmas carol

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,671
I like it even better when they stop

13
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:05,374
Night and day, they dance and play
They never sleep much either

14
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,307
Would some peace and quiet be a crime?

15
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,810
Fa-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la

16
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:12,438
Of course, I love each one of them
But Santa needs a breather

17
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:15,711
Because they're just so happy
all the time

18
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,548
- They're oddly
- Happy all the time

19
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,781
- Ungodly
- Happy all the time

20
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:23,519
When they sing until they're bluish
Santa wishes he were Jewish

21
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,219
- 'Cause they're
- Happy all the time

22
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,387
- I swear they're
- Happy all the time

23
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:31,525
- Bizarrely happy
- All the time

24
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:35,138
SANTA: But there's an elf called Buddy
Who makes them look apathetic

25
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:39,004
ALL: If he were any sweeter
We might end up diabetic

26
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:42,476
SANTA: He's everybody's buddy
But he'll leave your eardrums ringing

27
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:46,014
ALL: 'Cause everywhere he goes
He has to tell the world he's singing

28
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,675
I'm singing

29
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:52,221
It's almost Christmas and I'm singing

30
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:56,224
And I love Santa, so I'm singing

31
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,362
Buddy, you're standing on an elf again.

32
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,395
I thought the floor felt squishy.

33
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,191
Sorry, Ming Ming.

34
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,390
That's okay, Buddy.

35
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:07,168
(SINGING) My spine will heal
Because I'm happy all the time

36
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,567
Okay, elves, you've got toys to make.

37
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,641
Yay! Time to go to work.

38
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,506
ALL (SINGING): Happy all the time

39
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,078
Happy all the time

40
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,877
Making toys is so appealing
That I spend each morning squealing

41
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,518
True, he's happy all the time

42
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:24,052
- Who knew? I'm happy all the time
- Happy all the time

43
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,850
He's unnaturally happy

44
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:32,395
All the time

45
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,691
Happy all the time

47
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:40,397
Oh, no. I made a big mess again.

48
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,372
It's okay, Buddy.

49
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:47,670
Why don't you just say it?
I'm a cotton-headed ninny-muggins.

00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,085

I keep stepping on Ming Ming.

And yesterday,
I only made 400 rocking horses.

56

Sometimes I don't feel
like I'm an elf at all.

(SIGHS)

58
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:13,201
Well, Buddy, let me tell you a story
I should have told years ago.

59
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,394
A story.

60
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,563
Whoo-hoo! I love story time.

61
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,676
Holy moly! My legs! My legs!

62
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,812
- Aah!
- A story about your legs?

63
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,311
I love it already.

64
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,279
No, Buddy. Just listen.

65
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:31,717
Once upon a time, on a Christmas night,
I slid down the chimney of an orphanage.

66
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,620
While I was putting presents
under the tree...

67
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:38,126
a baby crawled, unseen,
into my toy sack...

68
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,730
and I brought him back here by mistake.

69
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:45,029
Never having stolen a baby before,
I didn't know what to do.

70
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:48,536
So the elves took him in
and raised him as one of their own.

71
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:54,737
And as the years went on,
he grew bigger and bigger and bigger.

72
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:58,775
Oh. So I'm a giant elf.

73
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,179
- No. Buddy, you're...
- Wait.

74
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,787
I thought this was a story
about your legs.

75
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,617
No, this is your story.

76
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,816
The story of Buddy the Elf.

77
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:12,555
- Well, actually, Buddy the Human.
- Human?

78
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,359
Your mother's name was Susan Wells.

Now all you have left is your father,
who never knew you were born.

His name is Walter Hobbs...

81

and he lives in a strange land
called New York City.

82

And he works right here
in the Empire State Building.

Well, of course.

I bet he's the world's greatest dad.

Yeah, about that...

91
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,900
So, what's the world's
greatest dad like?

92
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:55,164
I mean, does he prefer candy canes
or peppermint sticks?

93
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,569
Uh, he doesn't like either.

94
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,338
Well, the world's greatest dad must have
a top-of-the-line, one-horse open sleigh.

95
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,383
Well, then how does he dash
through the snow?

96
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:12,182
You see, like a lot of people these days,
he's just lost the Christmas spirit.

97
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:16,020
But Christmas spirit
is what makes your sleigh fly.

98
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:20,130
And every year, it's tougher
to get this old girl off the ground.

a Naughty Lister?

and their naughty little hands...

I go through the Cotton Candy Caverns,
brave the Gumdrop Ocean...

00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,916
trek through the Candy forest,
then straight on to New York.

- Bye-bye.
- Good luck.

Till the snow begins to blow

Then we'll run inside
and start a tickle fight

127
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:48,110
And if it's too cold to sled
We'll eat gingerbread instead

And then cuddle
till he tucks me in at night

00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,745
You are on the Naughty List.

313
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,042
(NAUGHTY LISTERS WHISPERING)

314
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:19,121
Look, I don't believe in Santa Claus
and I don't believe you're my son.

315
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,781
Now, leave me alone! You got that?

316
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:25,085
But Susan Wells was my mother.

317
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,924
Susan Wells?

318
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:32,267
Wha...? Uh, you have
another son, Walter?

319
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,768
He may or may not be my son.

320
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:39,541
Unfortunately,
the facts are pointing towards "may."

321
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:43,077
Then, until we get this sorted out,
he needs to stay with us.

322
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,407
Yay!

323
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,050
But he thinks he's an elf.

324
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,379
No, I was just raised by them.

325
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:54,015
It's almost Christmas
and there's no decorations in this house.

326
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,284
Oh, do you wanna decorate the apartment?

327
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,826
WALTER: No way. No decorations.

328
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,624
All that Christmas-spirit stuff
is a scam.

329
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:06,961
Dad says, "The holidays are a time for us
to make money, not spend it."

330
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,128
No wonder he's on the Naughty List.

331
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:10,637
Yes, that's right, Michael.

332
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:14,903
And if I don't come up with a new book idea,
I'm not gonna be making any money.

333
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:19,478
Come on, Dad. For once, can you
please let us put up some decorations?

334
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:22,744
- Yeah, please. Please, please, please.
- Please, please, please.

335
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,320
Fine. Just don't go overboard.

336
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,583
- Oh, thank you! Yes!
- Yes! All right!

337
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,720
(SINGING)
There's a saying we have up north

338
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,126
That helps us put our best foot forth

339
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,767
If you wanna deck the halls for Mr. C

340
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:42,235
Make sure
they're sparkle-jolly-twinkle-jingley

341
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,203
What's that supposed to mean?

342
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,841
When a room is gloomy
And its atmosphere has called it quits

343
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:53,609
Then you must remember
That December is a time for glitz

344
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,219
Never stop until each limb
On your Christmas tree

345
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:01,290
Is sparkle-jolly-twinkle-jingley

346
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:06,625
Pick up every ornament
That's sitting, waiting on a shelf

347
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:11,029
While you're busy decorating
Why not decorate yourself?

348
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,535
Soon you'll bring a smile
To every person you see

349
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:19,008
- I'm sparkle-twinkle-jolly... What?
- Close enough.

350
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,405
(SINGING) And if you're at a loss

351
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:26,641
Remember the phrase that says
To thine own elf be true

352
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,307
To thine own elf be true

353
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:32,980
For when it comes to Christmas displays

354
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,557
Look inside and you'll know what to do

355
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,990
MICHAEL: You'll know just what to do

356
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:42,030
ALL: Put some cheery folderol
On every wall and every nook

357
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:46,533
Tinsel up each corner
Till it's Christmas everywhere you look

358
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:50,504
Give the world a holiday
That's bright as can be

359
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:58,312
Make it sparkle-jolly-twinkle-jingle
Shiny-showy-cheery-Kringle

360
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,711
Razzle-dazzle, ring-a-lingle

361
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,910
I can't lie, it makes me tingle

362
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:08,460
ALL: Sparkle-jolly-twinkle-jingley

363
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,556
- Wow.
- Cool.

364
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:19,527
SANTA: So Buddy did his best
to spread Christmas cheer.

365
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:24,970
But it would take more than some tinsel and
lights to get Walter off the Naughty List.

366
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,871
Can you please pass the maple syrup?

367
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,808
I'm sorry. I didn't set out any syrup.

368
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,538
It's spaghetti.

369
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,877
That's okay. I think I have some.

370
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,051
Cool. Hey, me next.

371
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,553
Ugh. I think I'm gonna
stick with coffee.

372
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:43,049
- BUDDY: I knew it.
- Knew what, Buddy?

373
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,128
I have the world's greatest dad.

374
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:49,922
Aw, look up, honey. Mistletoe.

375
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,431
Oh.

376
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:56,970
We've been tinkering with the story
of a snowman that comes to life...

377
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,200
named Freezy the Snowman.

378
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,139
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We even have a song.

379
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,506
(SINGING) Freezy the Snowman

380
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,944
He was made from balls
of snow, and then...

381
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,514
Okay, okay. I've heard enough.

382
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:07,707
(KAZOO HONKING)

383
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:11,318
Psst. Dad, Dad,
do you wanna hear me play the kazoo?

384
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,013
Buddy, enough with the kazoo!

385
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:21,197
I'm sorry. But my boss, Mr. Greenway,
gets really cranky when he's upset.

386
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,957
GREENWAY:
What kind of an office is this?

387
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,226
Doesn't anyone do any work around here?

388
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,996
- I ought to fire the whole lot of you.
- Shh.

389
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,505
GREENWAY: I've never seen an office
as poorly run as this one.

390
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:35,178
- WORKER 1: Good morning, Mr. Greenway.
- WORKER 2: Good morning, Mr. Greenway.

391
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,143
Zip it. You're fired!

392
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:40,181
- Buy some cookies?
- You're fired!

393
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,644
You're fired!

394
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,519
Fired! Fired! Fired!

395
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,281
Fired!

396
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:51,460
What am I paying you for?
Get back to work!

397
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,860
Oh. When my boss is having a tough day,
we bring him milk and cookies...

398
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,592
and sing Christmas carols
so he forgets his troubles.

399
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,896
Buddy, you're a genius.

400
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:05,107
We distract Greenway with tinsel and eggnog,
and all that other holiday nonsense...

401
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,437
make him feel that Christmas spirit...

402
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,136
and he won't notice
how lame our ideas are.

403
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:15,749
Oh. I can help decorate. And we can all
dress up like gingerbread men and sing.

404
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:18,615
Uh, that's okay, Buddy.
We can handle it from here.

405
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,779
Why don't you take
the rest of the day off?

406
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,755
Thanks, Pop. You're the greatest.

Uh, where's Rockefeller Center?

00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,828
- BUDDY: Hey, Jovie!
- Huh?

410
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:42,004
You weren't kidding. That is a big tree.

411
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,410
Yeah, my mom used to take me here
over the holidays as a kid.

412
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,915
It's kind of fun watching skaters
fall on their butts.

413
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,451
(BOTH LAUGHING)

414
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,850
- Let's go skating.
- Mm...

415
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:54,785
I'm not very good.

416
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:58,086
Well, neither am I.
I was the worst skater in the North Pole.

417
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,957
They called me the triple klutz.

418
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,120
Now, please, don't laugh.

419
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,767
Okay. Do you need to hold onto me?

420
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,163
Huh?

421
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,884
- Uh, oh, yeah, Buddy. You're terrible.
- I know.

422
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:31,892
The final rotation of my octuple salchow
wasn't very clean. Oh.

423
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,927
Anyway, so who's your favorite reindeer?

424
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:37,295
Mine's Dasher, followed by Comet,
but he can be a little messy.

425
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:40,596
I wish I could still get as excited
about the holidays as you.

426
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,865
I always say the best way
to spread Christmas cheer...

427
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,566
is singing loud for all to hear.

428
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,905
I don't sing, remember?

429
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:52,947
(SINGING)
Come on, Jovie, singing can be easy

430
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,140
Please, stop.

431
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:57,310
It's fun, it's free,
and best of all it's...

432
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,820
- Totally cheesy?
- Come on.

433
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:04,620
(SINGING) All you have to do
Is move your voice much higher

434
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:07,821
High, low, high, low

435
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,021
High

436
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:12,794
It's just like talking only you sustain it
And make it sound pretty

437
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:14,894
No.

438
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,803
Just sing a Christmas song

439
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:22,810
It's like magic if things go wrong

440
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:26,541
Just spread some Christmas cheer

441
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:32,053
By singing loud for all to hear

442
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,123
- But when I sing, people stare.
- That's the point.

443
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,626
(SINGING) And if you're short on cheer
Think about that year

444
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:43,961
You woke up to find
A brand-new snow had fallen

445
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:48,628
The ornaments you made
Way back in second grade

446
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:52,799
Untangling the Christmas lights
Took your father several nights

447
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:57,071
Your mother claimed that she had proof
There were reindeer on the roof

448
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:02,514
Remember who you were back then
Let those moments live again

449
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,450
Come on, Jovie. Try it for me.

450
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,819
(SINGING) Just sing a Christmas song

451
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,015
That's it.

452
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,924
It's like magic if things go wrong

453
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,154
Keep going.

454
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,732
Think of the joy you'll bring

455
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:21,928
- If you just close your eyes
- If you just close your eyes

456
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:25,802
- If you just close your eyes
- If you just close your eyes

457
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,070
- If you just close your eyes
- If you just close your eyes

458
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:34,707
- And sing
- And sing

459
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,360
Aw, shucks.

460
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:49,859
- CHADWICK: And so...
- Freezy, the green grouchy snowman...

461
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,968
with the light-up antlers
flew through the terrible storm...

462
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:56,401
and delivered the presents
to the Whys of Whyville.

463
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:59,007
Merry Christmas, everyone.

You know, maybe it's the eggnog talking,

but this is the best idea
I've heard all year.

Heh-heh.

Oh, no. Did you leave your uniform
at Santa's workshop?

That's okay, I have a spare.

you'd better bring me an original idea!

00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:39,828
So guess who's about to have...

623
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:41,463
- an emergency landing.
- Aah!

624
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,257
EMILY: Buddy?

625
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,560
- Buddy?
- Buddy?

626
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,760
There's no way Buddy's out here.

627
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:48,995
Buddy.

628
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,231
- MICHAEL: Hi, Buddy.
- Hi.

629
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:54,639
- Buddy. Oh, we were so worried.
- I knew we'd find you.

630
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,870
Buddy, I'm glad you're okay.

631
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,946
I have something I need to say to you.

632
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:00,741
And I have something to say to you.

633
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,576
It can wait. This is important.

634
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:06,130
But mine's really, really,
really important.

635
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:09,550
- Then go ahead.
- Santa's sleigh is about to crash...

636
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,820
- because there's not enough Christmas spirit.
- Okay, that can wait. Listen.

637
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,327
Ever since you showed up...

638
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:17,329
you've brought this family closer
than it's ever been.

639
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,100
You've filled my heart
with Christmas spirit.

640
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:23,705
This whole elf thing is a little weird,
but I know you're my son, Buddy...

641
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:24,931
and I love you.

642
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,000
I love you too, Dad.

643
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,805
Okay, that's enough.

644
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,613
Whoa, cool.

645
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,918
Ho, ho. That was a close one.

646
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,556
Hello, Buddy.

647
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:41,746
Who's this?

648
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:46,259
Everyone, I'd like you to meet
my really good friend, Santa Claus.

649
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,795
Walter, I'm very proud of you.

650
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:52,127
You've rediscovered
the true meaning of Christmas:

651
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,792
Your family.

652
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,232
Congratulations.

653
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:59,341
You, sir, are officially
off the Naughty List.

654
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:00,976
Yes!

655
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,236
Santa Claus!

656
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,874
Nice to meet you, Michael.

657
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,572
I can't believe this.

658
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:10,184
Now that you're off the Naughty List,
Walter...

659
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,449
But this is crazy. How is this possible?

660
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,988
Just open it, Dad.

661
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,126
Is this what I think it is?

662
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:20,592
The skateboard I asked for
when I was 5 years old?

663
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:24,062
Of course not. What are you going to do
with a skateboard?

664
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,326
It's a shirt.

665
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:30,203
Ha-ha-ha. It's a skateboard.

666
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,199
You're real.

667
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,843
Santa Claus is real.

668
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,069
Wow!

669
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,111
(SLEIGH WHIRRING)

670
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:39,942
MICHAEL: Whoa, what just happened?

671
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:43,517
Your dad's Christmas spirit
just made my sleigh fly.

672
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:47,212
But we're gonna need a whole lot more
to get it back in the air.

673
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:48,982
(NAUGHTY LISTERS WHISPERING)

674
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,424
Oh, no. I was worried about this.

675
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:57,725
- What is it?
- Is it who I think it is?

676
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:01,698
SANTA: Yep. Naughty Listers.

677
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:05,432
Yeah, and we're here
for the presents, jerk.

678
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,968
Mr. Greenway?

679
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:10,112
Don't be so surprised, Hobbs.

680
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:12,441
Of course, I'm on the Naughty List.

681
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:16,210
Time to give up those presents, fatso!

682
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,376
No way, José.

683
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:22,719
Go spread as much Christmas cheer as you can
and we'll get that sleigh off the ground.

684
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,382
Go, go, go.

685
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:29,330
Get those presents!

686
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,228
All right, Buddy.

687
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:32,732
Lock and load.

688
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,560
Let's do this.

689
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,105
There's too many, Buddy. Hang on.

690
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,636
Hyah! Hyah!

691
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,982
MICHAEL:
Okay, let's spread some Christmas cheer.

692
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,176
We can't let Buddy down.

693
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,287
Buddy? Buddy the Elf?

694
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:53,851
How do you know Buddy?

695
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,422
He's the one who told me...

696
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:00,359
the best way to spread Christmas cheer
is singing loud for all to hear.

697
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,623
A song. That's a great idea.

698
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,289
We should go out there and sing.

699
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:07,163
Uh, I don't like singing
in front of people.

700
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:10,306
Oh, where's your Christmas spirit?
Buddy needs us to do this.

701
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:11,906
Walter, if she doesn't wanna sing...

702
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,272
If Buddy's in trouble,
then I wanna help. Let's go.

703
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,555
Come on, Jovie, you can do this.

704
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,452
It's for Buddy.

705
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,586
(SINGING) All you have to do

706
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,628
Is move your voice much higher

707
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:38,494
High, low, high, low

708

High

709
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:47,501
Just sing a Christmas song

710
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:52,478
It's like magic if things go wrong

711
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:56,744
Just spread some Christmas cheer

Just sing a Christmas song

And keep on singing all season long

715

Think of the joy you'll bring

716
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:19,599
If you just close your eyes and sing

717
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,604
Give me those presents!

a little more Christmas spirit.

Show some Christmas spirit.

Think about that year

727

You woke up to find
A brand-new snow had fallen

728
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:08,816
The ornaments you made
Way back in second grade

Untangling the Christmas lights
Took your father several nights

730

Your mother claimed that she had proof
There were reindeer on the roof

Remember who you were back then

You want a ride back to the North Pole,

No, thanks, Santa. I'm happy here.

Yeah. I don't even care
that I quit my job.

I quit my job.

Fresh out of toys
Santa makes his way back

763
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:12,876
When he hears a small noise
From inside of his pack

764
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,643
A sound that's not unlike a baby's cry

765
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:20,846
It's enough to leave
the jolly guy perplexed

766
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,046
And?

767
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,625

Back from his ride
Santa gathers his elves

They'll raise the baby themselves

The North Pole
Isn't made for humans, though

00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:45,442
And soon the phony elf
Begins to grow so tall

will fly right off the shelf

And maybe Buddy helps his dad

781
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,662

A son is something he can't dismiss
