1
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,926
Breakfast for me,
breakfast for Ranjit...

2
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,327
...and what about
breakfast for the kids?

3
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,931
No breakfast for them, no lunch.

4
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:47,266
- Yes, why? - Have you
seen their school grades?

5
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:53,546
Six out of ten, four out of ten
and a zero in mathematics! Zero.

6
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:58,344
- Imps! Why have you scored so low?
- That's just why.

7
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,516
No breakfast, no lunch for them.

8
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,018
You'll keep the tiger hungry?

9
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,522
Tiger? Oh you mean your daddy?

10
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,923
Why should he go hungry?

11
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,528
Because that scorecard is his.

12
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,865
- Jassi's? From his schooldays?
- Yes Grandpa

13
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:20,700
Such were the fruits Daddy reaped
with his labours. He hid it away

14
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:26,042
- Kids, what about your grades?
- Here. I scored 80 percent.

15
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,046
Ravi scored 85 percent.

16
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:31,945
The rascal!
All these 27 years he hid it!

17
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:38,989
I'll shave his head or,
I'm no head of the family

18
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,593
There he is.

19
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:48,098
Well Daddy, whom are
you tonsuring today?

20
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,002
- Tell him!
- Remember that perfect portrait?

21
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,401
The time when I shaved your
head when you were a kid

22
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:00,009
You know?
Nitu has scored 80 percent...

23
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,138
...and Ravi scored 85 percent

24
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,341
Is that any reason to rejoice?

25
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:09,850
I used to score between
95 and 97 percent

26
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,384
Grandpa... junk

27
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,252
- Junk?
- That's about the junk we trashed.

28
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:21,392
In mathematics,
I scored 99 percent.

29
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,864
Grandpa... trash.

30
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:29,900
- Trash?
- We trashed the junk.

31
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:35,614
Make sure you put in
the effort, score more.

32
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:42,814
Oh Lord! What's happening to me?
Jesus...

33
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:51,062
- What's happening?
- What happened?

34
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:57,465
- Does anyone even care for me?
- Why what's wrong, Steven?

35
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:02,403
I was fine, I was asleep and
something happened when I got up

36
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,609
My waist is feeling like...

37
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:11,617
...a lamp-post
run-into by a truck!

38
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,653
I'll get you milk and turmeric.

39
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,212
Bless turmeric!
Turmeric is healthy

40
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,880
Turmeric is no use, Mummy

41
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:23,926
- I'm calling the doctor.
- No injections! Hurts.

42
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:29,930
- Do something!
- Yes, right away.

43
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:41,009
- It's gone!
- It never was.

44
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:46,341
But it was! And as soon as you
said one-two-three, it was gone.

45
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,282
At your age, you're the one
who's a genius at kidding.

46
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:58,526
Just like the acts you put in
when you wanted chocolates...

47
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:06,330
...that's my waist-ache, I crave
for the attention you know.

48
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:31,025
- May I come in?
- Yes?

49
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:35,734
Can you tell where this address is?
I got to deliver flowers.

50
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:54,412
Son of a mad dog! How dare you
ask me about Steven D'souza?

51
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,791
- So you went to him asking for me?
- I did

52
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,891
- And he gave you an answer?
- A slap.

53
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,722
- On which cheek?
- This one

54
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,034
How dare you ask my
address from that Chaddha?

55
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:52,404
Saw? The vibes of rivalry!
Can even set flowers afire.

56
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:56,811
Think! You come to deliver
flowers and you get slapped

57
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,451
Had you come delivering
cooking gas...

58
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,383
...you'd be blown to smithereens.

59
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:05,013
- What kind of a rivalry is this?
- That's just the trailer.

60
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:09,388
See the sons and you'll get to
see a whole movie. Action-packed

61
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,790
Goodness

62
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:46,020
No, we don't trail him.

63
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,201
He mustn't overtake us.

64
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,272
Overtake, quick.

65
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,368
Faster.

66
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:15,258
- No losing! We must race ahead.
- Just watch

67
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:19,863
Speed up

68
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:21,865
Overtake.

69
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:27,871
See?

70
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,474
Well done!
Now what does he do?

71
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,933
Son of a gun!
You let the rogue win.

72
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:04,875
I'm fed up of their spats.
Forever up to one-upmanship.

73
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:11,872
Warring countries can become
friends, but not them.

74
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,675
God help

75
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:19,381
Why do they squabble?
Is it a Hindu-Christian clash?

76
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:23,720
My Daddy told me that they
were once the best of friends

77
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:32,266
They wined, dined and
socialised with each other.

78
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,599
Among the Christians,
there were Anthony...

79
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,335
...and his elder brother, Moses

80
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,273
And there were Anjali
and her brother Jassi

81
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,207
The families were close friends.

82
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,544
Anjali and Anthony were friends too

83
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,519
- With time, the friendship changed.
- Meaning?

84
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,749
- They fell in love.
- And then?

85
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,493
That which always happens.

86
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,186
Their families got
wind of the affair.

87
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,397
Anjali was already betrothed.

88
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,797
The Hindu family
refused to consent.

89
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,800
The families raked up
a mighty quarrel...

90
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:10,203
...but Anjali and
Anthony were unscathed

91
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,170
They were in love and...

92
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:18,007
they went away from their families.
Eloped. Married

93
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,011
It's been 27 years without even
a single letter from the couple.

94
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:29,493
It's said they live in Delhi.
But over here...

95
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,725
...the loving ties that the two
families shared was shattered.

96
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,657
Shattered forever?

97
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,396
And their conspiracies
fuel their hatred.

98
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:44,802
- Can they never friends again?
- It can only be a miracle.

99
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,748
- How are you, Tulsiram?
- I'm fine, thank you.

100
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,852
- For us?
- Yes madam

101
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,688
- Where from?
- One Raja from New Delhi.

102
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:09,860
- Whose letter, Daddy?
- Anjali's son.

103
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:16,075
- Anjali... who's Anjali?
- Jassi! Your sister.

104
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,476
Anjali's letter? After 27 years?

105
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,743
Ranjit! Papa's sister's letter.

106
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:29,918
- Read it. What does she write?
- Not Anjali, her son

107
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,124
- Read it!
- "Respected Grandfather..."

108
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:36,456
"Grandmother, Uncle,
Aunt, my obeisances"

109
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:38,927
Who cares for his obeisances?

110
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:44,131
"For long, I have
wanted to meet you"

111
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,133
"I crave for your affections"

112
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,138
Craves?

113
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,472
"My wish is about to be given.

114
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,313
I am arriving tomorrow.
Yours, Raja"

115
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,740
Let him come.
I'll put him in his place.

116
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:03,415
- Mummy, who's Raja to us?
- Your cousin.

117
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:04,881
Shut up!

118
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:12,130
- Stop telling them nonsense!
- But he is their cousin.

119
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,927
...And you and I are uncle and aunt.
- Enough! Stop it!

120
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:21,139
What relationship?
The relationship was over...

121
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,734
...the day she eloped
with that Christian boy

122
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:32,477
Daddy, you tell everyone!
Anyone who tries to be friendly...

123
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,187
...anyone who welcomes the
son of that runaway girl...

124
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,352
...will leave this house.

125
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,195
He is no relation of ours.

126
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,460
Not even his shadow must
fall upon this house.

127
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,702
Mother of Moses, what's this I see?

128
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,535
Over there.

129
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,003
Here's grandma.

130
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,146
Rosie, I ask you. In this house
who's the elder? Me or Moses?

131
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,141
- You.
- Then I decide...

132
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,185
...who is welcome and who isn't.

133
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:19,864
This is my decision.
That boy won't step into my house.

134
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,863
If he does, I'll break his bones.

135
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,475
Whose photo is that?

136
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:17,815
"The feather in your turban..."

137
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:26,659
"is made resplendent by a gem..."

138
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:44,282
"...reflecting the colours of joy"

139
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,821
"Let's celebrate"

140
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:30,590
"Thank your mother,
she gives you luck"

141
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,330
"And here comes
your luckiest day..."

142
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,334
"when you will wed"

143
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:43,665
"Bedecked in flowers...

144
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:50,508
...you have come to wed"

145
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,821
"Fragrant...

146
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,923
...is the day..."

147
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,530
"come, let's celebrate"

148
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:22,344
"Let's celebrate"

149
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:50,006
"His sisters await
their sister-in-law..."

150
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:56,574
"for they want her for a friend"

151
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:03,011
"Their brother is lovable
his wife must be lovable"

152
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:09,655
"And they will make
a lovely couple"

153
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,060
"Like the Sun and the Moon..."

154
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:27,401
"like the Sun wedding the Moon"

155
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,450
"Let's celebrate"

156
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,459
"Oh come, let's celebrate"

157
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,058
So, boarding the wrong bus
was a wonderful mistake!

158
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,468
Unbelievable!

159
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,470
You came among us a stranger,
now you're part of the family.

160
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:57,264
Raja, won't you stay?
Won't you cheer up the bride?

161
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:01,206
But an untrodden path
beckons me. Farewell.

162
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:06,681
Lucky, we got a lift.
Else, we were stranded here for 3 days

163
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,470
Grandmother, Raja is here.

164
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:35,879
Grandfather

165
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,785
Greetings, Uncle.

166
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:56,125
- Uncle...
- Raja, it's curtains. No use.

167
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:35,838
- Both gates shut. Now what?
- A third gate is still open

168
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:39,536
- Which one?
- Brains, you fool. The mind

169
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,547
Any houses on
hire on this street?

170
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,883
Not one in the entire village.

171
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,345
- Why? - I told you.
No houses on rent.

172
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:06,931
The rest are like part players.

173
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,263
That one looks like an
important character.

174
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:15,613
- Hi Mr Smokes! How are you?
- Who are you?

175
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,281
- You're Mr Smokes, aren't you?
- Who says?

176
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:24,622
A man is know by his habits.
You smoke, so you're Mr Smokes

177
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,259
- My name is Balli.
- Any other name makes a difference?

178
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,454
Come, let's go to the hotel.
Remember?

179
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,460
We met at the Vaishno
Devi shrine...

180
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:38,866
and we sang glories to the goddess.

181
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,471
But I've never been
to Vaishno Devi.

182
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,172
What difference?
Let's sit.

183
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,673
Remember?
We shared the sweet "laddoos"

184
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,074
- Hey, sweets for us.
- Not sweets. I have blood sugar.

185
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,842
- Blood sugar?
- Yes, and spices give me ulcers.

186
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,476
And sours give me a cough.
Salt pumps up blood pressure.

187
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:59,523
Ice cream gives me a cold and
cold drink gives me asthma.

188
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:02,993
So many diseases?
Despite, you smoke?

189
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:10,158
What to do? For me, smoke is
breakfast, lunch and dinner

190
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:14,832
- I smoke, despite the asthma.
- Raja, we got ourselves a house

191
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,865
- How come?
- He has every disease.

192
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,411
He'll die soon.
As soon as he dies, we'll move in

193
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,345
Why are you laughing?
What's the topic?

194
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:32,386
Topic is why won't anyone
let us rent a house?

195
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,123
You don't know!
Your uncles...

196
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:40,722
They won't spare the man who
puts you up. So best for you...

197
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:45,132
...go back the way
you came. Goodbye

198
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:04,278
If you are stubborn, so am I.
It's your blood in my veins

199
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,181
If you don't accept me...

200
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,729
I'm picketing...

201
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,731
- right here, in this lane.
- That's my challenge

202
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,531
- Sorry, I got emotional.
- Get it?

203
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:33,275
Grandma, Raja is
sitting right outside.

204
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,784
Outside?

205
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:39,053
So what, so what?
Go, don't disturb me

206
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,052
Come here

207
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:44,126
Take care of the wafers.
I'm going upstairs.

208
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:14,121
- What's taking you?
- Just came up to see the lovely...

209
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:18,987
- The lovely...
- I mean I came to see the Moon

210
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:24,600
The Moon rises at night.
Are you mad?

211
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,132
What are you looking at?
Go inside

212
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:35,534
Went out to check
whether the gate is shut.

213
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:39,869
- The gate is shut.
- The gate to your heart...

214
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:44,541
...that's what you must shut

215
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:53,187
- Great one-line from your son.
- Left you at a loss for words

216
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,571
It's nearly eight!
And you're still sitting here? Go inside

217
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:13,273
Shut your shops!
It's nearly eight

218
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:19,474
Get out of here!
It's nearly eight

219
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,925
One minute... why is
everyone running scared?

220
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:32,261
Ghuman Singh Rathore starts
singing at eight o'clock.

221
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:33,591
It's a catastrophe

222
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,593
Let me go! My wife and
children are all alone at home

223
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,202
Guns and knives are
used for threatening

224
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,943
For the first time someone's
using music for threatening

225
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,341
Who might it be?

226
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,062
- Wonderful!
- Rise, children

227
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,059
- What a voice!
- Rise

228
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:51,330
- What a song!
- Was that a song?

229
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,736
Master, why are you in tears?

230
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:03,637
For the first time in my life...

231
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:06,615
...I find patrons of
my music at my doorstep

232
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:10,849
My cup floweth over in my tears

233
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:15,024
- You are great, Master!
Great! - Forget me

234
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:22,327
Tell me about yourselves.
Who are you? What do you want?

235
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:27,068
My name is Lucky lyer.
I'm India's first lucky lyer.

236
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:31,871
Lucky lyer? You look like a Punjabi
and you talk like a Tamil

237
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:33,735
What are you?
North Indian? South Indian?

238
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:37,346
My mother is North Indian.
My Dad is South Indian.

239
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:38,744
I'm complete Indian

240
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:42,347
Your friend is quite a bore.
- Mr Ghuman Singh...

241
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:45,517
all day we have been
looking for a place on rent

242
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:51,125
- Have you been refused?
- Yes Master

243
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,931
Who has refused you?
Tell me his name

244
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:58,461
I'll sing the song of thunder!
I'll send him shockwaves

245
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:02,731
Who dares?
I ask who dares?

246
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,076
Tell me who you are

247
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:10,742
Who refuses to
accommodate my disciples?

248
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,677
Get one thing clear!

249
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,784
My disciples are
going to live with me

250
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,454
And they will hear
my songs everyday

251
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:24,126
Boys...

252
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:28,529
Where are those boys?

253
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,732
Close up

254
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,585
Wait, let it dry

255
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,928
Don't you dare try to get too close

256
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:46,276
Not blessings, we can
only wish ill of you

257
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,265
Daddy, you're repairing
that junk forever.

258
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,530
Why won't you sell it?

259
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,536
The constant companion of my youth!
Don't call it junk.

260
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,275
But who'll buy it?

261
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,308
Uncle Jassi.

262
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:24,044
It's my birthday.

263
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:27,318
I thought I'd bring some sweets
and ask for your blessings.

264
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,719
- Balli...
- Yes sir?

265
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,117
- Go and get it.
- What, sir?

266
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,925
- Sir!
- Do what I told you.

267
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,331
- Please... have some.
- Wait, what's the hurry?

268
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,999
He's bringing my blessings.

269
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,838
- So today's your birthday?
- Yes Uncle

270
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,841
- What's your sun sign?
- Gemini

271
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,505
Two faces, no?

272
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:06,880
- What's that? Sanctified water?
- Poison

273
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:12,329
- Uncle?
- Son of a gun!

274
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:21,464
Your parents disgraced us!
Your sweets are like poison to us.

275
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,687
He wasn't asking for our property!

276
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,059
All he wanted were blessings.

277
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:50,662
- Nothing's nice in this house!
- What is the matter?

278
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,733
You take care of your house.
I'm going

279
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:57,007
- Where to?
- To the temple. I'll pray for Raja

280
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,501
If my husband asks say I've
gone to the beauty parlour.

281
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:08,384
Offerings

282
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:12,345
What's the old man doing here?

283
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,922
Today's my grandson's birthday.

284
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,191
Say a nice prayer
for his long life.

285
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,804
Where did this old
woman transpire from?

286
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,746
- Whom did you call "old woman"?
- No! I said...

287
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:39,415
"Where did this doll
transpire from?"

288
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,213
And what's my doll doing here?

289
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,453
I'm just praying to
The Lord our Father

290
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:50,450
In the temple of
The Mother Goddess?

291
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:54,998
No! Not The Lord!
I'm praying to The Mother Goddess

292
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,866
Praying to The Mother Goddess?
For Raja?

293
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:05,704
Yes, I'm praying for Raja

294
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,705
Then come, let's pray together.

295
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,069
Here, the holy fire.

296
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:27,987
Brothers, today is my
grandson's birthday

297
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,863
Eat your fill and give him
your heartfelt blessings.

298
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:37,735
Won't you give me some, Grandpa?

299
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,521
Won't you?

300
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,528
Yes, son.

301
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,135
- Come son, sit.
- Sit

302
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,808
It's bodes well to sit on
the steps of the temple.

303
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,271
He has taken after our Anjali.

304
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:19,812
Eyes, especially.
Ditto Anjali

305
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:24,316
When she smiled, her eyes narrowed.

306
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,524
Look, just like hers.

307
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:31,120
Does your mother think of us?

308
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:35,123
All day, she talks only about you.

309
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:43,532
We miss her too.
But this Jassi makes life hell for us.

310
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:45,532
He won't even let us speak of her!

311
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,337
No matter.
Now you're here, son.

312
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:53,141
We will overcome.
In you, we see our Anjali.

313
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,814
Won't you give him
something to eat?

314
00:35:58,055 --> 00:35:58,987
No Grannie, please

315
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:02,317
- So much sweet! I'll put on weight.
- You must

316
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:05,926
If you become fat, you'll
become even more cuddly.

317
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,538
Just a little soup.
Come on Grandma...

318
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:19,132
I should be the one
cooking for you.

319
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,875
The joy is in watching you eat.

320
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:31,387
See? The joy and the blessing,
it's all mine. Double profit

321
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:37,088
You talk just like your father.
I want his address.

322
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,596
- What for?
- The Johnsons in Delhi...

323
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:43,189
are related to us.
They have a daughter. Young, beautiful

324
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:45,397
- I want her to marry...
- To marry?

325
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,932
You... no, not you.
I want her to marry you

326
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,108
- Marry me?
- That's the only way...

327
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,871
...you can come into my family.

328
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:02,551
Your father married a Hindu girl.
Everyone in the family hates him.

329
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,386
If you marry a Christian girl...

330
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:08,591
...slowly people will
take a liking to you

331
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:14,389
Even Moses will accept you.
Shall I talk to Johnson?

332
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,591
- Grandma... I?
- Any problem?

333
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,097
- No, no problem.
- Then?

334
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:24,936
She isn't for you.

335
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:32,614
Grandpa's outside!

336
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,652
If he sees me here, he'll kill me.

337
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,451
Do I get out of the window?

338
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,214
I'll take the backdoor

339
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:49,063
Grandpa, you? I knew you'd come.
Come inside

340
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:55,934
This dog was after me.
That's why I came here

341
00:37:56,741 --> 00:38:00,199
- What dog? I don't see any dog.
- You can't. It was a black dog.

342
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,614
If you bark like a dog,
I'll kill you like a dog.

343
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:08,013
Come inside Grandpa, please

344
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,989
I'm not going in there.
What are you, some king?

345
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,253
Or is this some palace
I've come to see?

346
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:20,663
- I'm not going inside.
- Grandpa, what are you carrying?

347
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:31,465
I brought it for you. Sweets.
Today's your birthday

348
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:46,948
Grandpa, was it the dog, or was
it your love that drew you here?

349
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,389
You beware of him.

350
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:56,564
Welcome

351
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:05,470
Make yourselves comfortable.
Over there. I'll call Raja

352
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:12,478
Raja... get up son.
Lots of fruits have arrived.

353
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:16,719
And lots of sweets.

354
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,518
Why are you dragging
me out so early?

355
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,281
- They are here to see you.
- To see me?

356
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,190
- Not you. They're here to see you.
- Yes son.

357
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:30,529
Before that Rosie talks you into
marrying Johnson's daughter...

358
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:33,235
...I want you to marry
into our community.

359
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:34,336
- Me?
- Yes

360
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:38,001
- The other hand.
- You've had it

361
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,003
I heard

362
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:45,339
- So how do you like our Raja?
- As handsome as a slice of Moon.

363
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:49,081
Slice of Moon?
Oh, he's just out of bed.

364
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:51,184
After a bath, he's
"Moon in full bloom"

365
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:55,792
- Who's that beside him?
- The crater on the Moon.

366
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:00,389
Some for my ears too?

367
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,425
If you insult me again...

368
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:07,402
I'll tape your song and
I'll play it till you die.

369
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:10,598
I never heard that.
- He got it.

370
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:16,803
Grandma and Grannie!
Must do something.

371
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:33,862
I'm dead

372
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,665
Is that stupid lady here with
a marriage proposal for you?

373
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:43,873
That old hag has gone senile.
She has been blabbering all day

374
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:48,537
Don't you fall for what she says
I've finalised the match for you

375
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,282
- Yes Grannie?
- You'll marry the girl I choose.

376
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:56,919
- She's one in a million.
- Sure

377
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:58,920
One minute

378
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,517
You'll marry the girl I choose!
She's one in a billion.

379
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:25,474
I'm in a soup!

380
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,277
And you're behaving as if
you're here on a tourist visa?

381
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,678
- What can I do?
- At least say something.

382
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,556
- What are you doing?
- You just said, say something.

383
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:40,521
- I asked for advise! Help me!
- Take that, get off my back.

384
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:42,729
- What's this?
- Coin. Toss.

385
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,332
You say yes to one,
I'll say yes to the other.

386
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,528
- I can't say yes to either of them!
- Why?

387
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:52,542
- In that case, just say it...
- Should I?

388
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:59,949
Grandma and Grannie,
I am married.

389
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:09,050
Son, how could you get married
without even informing us?

390
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:13,321
- And why break the news so suddenly?
- I met her suddenly

391
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,522
I fell in love suddenly,
we got married suddenly.

392
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:18,726
- So I had to say it suddenly.
- She's a Hindu, no?

393
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:23,337
- Must be Christian, no?
- Neither Hindu, nor Christian.

394
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:26,940
- She's Hindustani.
- Hindustan music I heard of.

395
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:31,080
- What's this Hindustani creed?
- There's no greater religion.

396
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:33,610
Like Raja's parents...

397
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,946
...her mother is Hindu,
her father is a Christian.

398
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:40,122
- Therefore Hindustani, no?
- Forget it, what's her name?

399
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:41,590
- Name?
- Yes

400
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,651
- What's her name?
- Banto

401
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,495
- Banto?
- Betty

402
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:54,094
- She's Hindu, she's Christian too.
- Lovely name.

403
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:17,348
"Love flows forth from music,
making me hum this tune"

404
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:36,070
"Why not sing along?
Sing along, o'heart"

405
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:45,546
"Dreams turn to melody.
Sing along, o'heart"

406
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:55,387
"To my song, my
heart beats a rhythm"

407
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:25,348
Bless you.

408
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,524
He sings like me, no?

409
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:33,923
Wait... where are you going?
He's my disciple. I taught him.

410
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:40,796
But son, the crescendo was far
from perfect. But never mind.

411
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:42,137
Get lost.

412
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:48,738
Tomorrow morning, I'll teach you
how to flit though the scales.

413
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:58,685
Your voice is as ugly
as your looks are good.

414
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:00,255
Follow me.

415
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:07,129
That's the chord, now sing.

416
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,928
- Raja, a letter for you.
- What are you doing?

417
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,803
I'm teaching you!
How can you leave?

418
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,331
- End of the practice!
- Why?

419
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:22,676
Olden custom. If a letter arrives
in the middle of a session...

420
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,940
...that's the end of the practice.

421
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:32,984
- Whose letter is it?
- His wife. Banto Betty's

422
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:35,691
Banto Betty?
How come?

423
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:40,458
What will you do when she comes?

424
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:46,528
- Lucky, what the hell is this?
- I wrote it and I posted it.

425
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,534
To convince them that you
are cent percent married.

426
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:53,206
What are you doing out there?
Read the letter, what's in it?

427
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:54,740
Reading uncle, reading

428
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,874
"Please accept your
wife's loving greetings"

429
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:01,809
"I'm fine and I suspect
you must be fine too"

430
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:06,746
"I'm not worried one bit for
you. Because I'm sure..."

431
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:10,986
"the wonderful Lucky is
taking wonderful care of you"

432
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:14,826
"I'm lucky that you
have a friend like him"

433
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:19,198
You are Raja's friend. Why does
his wife consider herself lucky?

434
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:22,471
- Affection Uncle, affection.
- Some infection.

435
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:26,538
"I know how unhappy you must
be staying away from me"

436
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:30,008
"I'm unhappy too,
because Lucky is so far away"

437
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:35,477
What's going on?
Whose wife wrote that? Yours or his?

438
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,050
As between us,
we don't differentiate.

439
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:41,518
His wife or mine, she's all ours.

440
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:46,660
I'll read the rest.

441
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:52,595
"Darling, our Pinky
has littered again"

442
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:55,931
"Let me know what you
want the pup named"

443
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,776
Ghuman Uncle means so much for us.

444
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,941
Why don't we name him Ghuman?

445
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:09,812
See? People proudly name their
sons after me. Son, who's Pinky?

446
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:14,521
- His wife's pet bitch.
- I never heard that.

447
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:17,790
- I'll read the rest.
- No! You can't.

448
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:20,658
- Why not?
- The rest is private.

449
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:26,268
- As between man and wife.
- You mean, it's like that?

450
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:38,939
Lucky, how long will we keep
posting letters full of lies?

451
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:41,082
We ought to get out of here...

452
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:43,945
...before we get
into worse problems

453
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:47,121
Here we are.
Hey, brake!

454
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:52,589
Will you please help
me with my luggage?

455
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:54,659
Keep the tip.

456
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,604
Where does Ghuman
Singh Rathore live?

457
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:09,277
One minute...

458
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,547
I'm Ghuman Singh Rathore.
Who are you?

459
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,875
Uncle! My obeisances.

460
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,949
- Raja! Your wife is here!
- Wife?

461
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:23,291
- Banto Betty is your wife, isn't she?
- Banto Betty?

462
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:28,988
- Hurry! She's waiting for you.
- Where did she transpire from?

463
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:32,334
- My hand is stuck!
- Come unstuck.

464
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:35,003
- But it won't come unstuck!
- Then leave it behind.

465
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:37,873
- Leave my right hand behind?
- Will you come along?

466
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:43,345
But how do I go?
Raja... listen...

467
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:46,609
Where are you taking the letter box?

468
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:51,345
My job is at stake!
I've two wives to feed.

469
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:18,410
Didn't I tell you he'd come
running to me like Milkha Singh?

470
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:20,677
How are you dear?

471
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:28,423
Why are you staring me down?
Oh I see! You are wondering...

472
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:30,458
...how I landed
up all of a sudden!

473
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:33,054
I wanted to give you a surprise.

474
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:36,063
So I didn't write
that I'm coming.

475
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,061
Nor did I write that.

476
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:43,063
What's wrong with you?
You're as thin as a reed.

477
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:47,643
- Lucky, doesn't he look feeble?
- No, he was fine.

478
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:52,271
- Your arrival has changed him.
- Strange! Won't you even react?

479
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:58,647
Raja! Will you talk to your
wife in public view? Go in.

480
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:00,954
Coming Uncle.
Come on dear.

481
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:04,459
Wait.

482
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,964
Who are you?
How are we related?

483
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:12,465
It doesn't befit a husband
to ask such questions...

484
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,469
...to his wife in public.

485
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:17,863
- Wife? Whose wife?
- No, son.

486
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:19,633
You don't talk to
your wife like that.

487
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:23,274
Who's she? I don't know
her Never seen her before!

488
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:24,479
What?

489
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:26,982
My child, you say something...

490
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:29,278
...he says quite something
else... what's up?

491
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,521
Because we've been
apart for a month...

492
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,852
...we aren't husband
and wife anymore?

493
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:40,122
- What justice is this?
- She says she is my wife?

494
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:45,866
- Does she have any proof?
- Yes, do you have any proof?

495
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:50,198
The vows I took with him,
are they any less proof?

496
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:53,542
The food I cooked for him,
is that any less proof?

497
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:57,740
- Did you videotape all that?
- Tape?

498
00:51:58,014 --> 00:52:01,472
- Yes, videotapes are in vogue.
- To hell with tapes.

499
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:03,850
Proof number one, is before you.
Live

500
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:05,984
Proof number two, is before me.
Live

501
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:09,818
You expect me to prove?
Like in old Hindi movies?

502
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:12,723
That his ring and
mine are the same?

503
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:14,327
That he has a black mole
on his back? No Uncle.

504
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:19,160
I'm modern, I'm confident!
And I've seen new age movies.

505
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:22,936
- So tell me. Am I your wife?
- You aren't.

506
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:29,343
- Uncle, where's the well?
- Are you thirsty?

507
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:31,342
No, I feel like drowning myself.

508
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:34,349
No, confident girls like
you don't drown themselves.

509
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,209
You drown others!
Drown him.

510
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:39,945
No my confidence is shattered!
I'll drown myself.

511
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:44,082
- No, at your age you have fun.
- No, I got to drown.

512
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:48,392
Stop! I know your problem.
And I've made him out.

513
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:53,932
Pick up her luggage and come in.
Come my child.

514
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:06,139
Beautiful room! Picture windows!
And hills! And creepers.

515
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,946
There's still time.
Tell me, who are you?

516
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:14,383
What remains to be told?
I'm your wife, you're my husband.

517
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:18,560
Stop talking nonsense! I know
how to shake off girls like you.

518
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:24,259
You want to get rid of me?
I know! In my absence...

519
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:29,100
...you took a mistress into my bedroom!
- You mustn't cry.

520
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:32,107
- Lucky, my brother...
- Brother?

521
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:36,211
Lucky, aren't you his friend?
At least, you can help me.

522
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:39,406
- Ask him why he's doing this!
- Why are you doing this?

523
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,014
Sometimes in life...

524
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:45,610
...you got to accept wife as
wife even if wife isn't wife.

525
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:51,894
- Why should I accept?
- One hand stuck in the mailbox.

526
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:53,655
If the other hand gets
stuck somewhere between...

527
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:56,459
...husband and wife, how do I eat?

528
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,667
Whom did you call husband-and-wife?

529
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:01,931
See, this is my problem.
She's yours.

530
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:06,108
I'll go out and solve mine,
in here you solve your problem.

531
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:09,275
Lucky's gone.

532
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:11,609
Why not shut the door?
Out of windows...

533
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:13,012
...watch brown-brown trees.
And talk romantic-type things?

534
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:14,606
How about?

535
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,652
My foot.

536
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:24,159
I bloody lost myself long ago.

537
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:32,066
- Pull.
- I'm pulling.

538
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:37,669
"Love flows forth from music...

539
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:41,676
...making me hum this tune"

540
00:54:52,389 --> 00:55:00,660
"Why not sing along?
Sing along, o'heart"

541
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:10,063
"Dreams turn to melody.
Sing along, o'heart"

542
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:13,673
Hey! How come you know this song?

543
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,169
How strange!
How can I not know?

544
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:21,682
When you were courting me
that was the song you sang.

545
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:24,682
Brother Lucky, tell us...

546
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,948
...can a wife not know
her husband's preferences?

547
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:31,387
- Glory to the lady!
- Shut up.

548
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:36,024
Came off!
It came off!

549
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:38,995
Raja... he's off too?

550
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:46,539
"Love flows forth from music...

551
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:51,008
...making me hum this tune"

552
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:04,792
"Why not sing along?...

553
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:09,731
...Sing along, o'heart"

554
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:19,131
"Dreams turn to melody.
Sing along, o'heart"

555
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:28,751
"To my song, my
heart beats a rhythm"

556
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:10,789
"Sometimes, when you
and I are together..."

557
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:15,591
"let there be music in our words"

558
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,804
"Sometimes, let there
be glorious days..."

559
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:29,810
"of colourful evenings
and glittering nights"

560
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:38,814
"Sometimes, let a waft
carry new colours of love"

561
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:43,654
"Sometimes, let's
forget this world"

562
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:48,190
"Sometimes, let's live our dreams"

563
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:53,059
"Let's reach for the skies"

564
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:57,870
"Come unto me, my love"

565
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:02,801
"Love beckons us"

566
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:07,816

00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,860
"Why not sing along?"

569
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:31,365
"Sing along, o'heart"

570
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:36,673

"Sometimes in passion...

574
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:36,939

in these rains"

575
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:46,345
"Sometimes in emotions...

576
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:51,453
...let's drown ourselves"

577
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:55,988
"I don't care...

578
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,995

01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:05,000
"I don't care if they wonder"

"Why you and I are like this"

581
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:14,339
"Why we're lost"

582
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:19,005
"Why we're so silent"

583
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:24,008
"I don't care if they
can't understand"

584
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:29,023
"Love flows forth from music...

01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:38,659
"Why not sing along?"

587
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:42,864

591
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:02,319
...my heart beats a rhythm"

592
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:06,060
Don't touch it!

593
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,563
All this trouble is
all because of you.

594
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:15,070
If I could, wouldn't I find
such pretty trouble for myself?

595
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,071
Soon I'm going to be
called an uncle...

596
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,073
...and I haven't
found an aunt yet.

597
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:23,077
I like all of them, not
one of them likes me.

598
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:29,118
Who's she looking for?

599
01:01:29,218 --> 01:01:30,150
Look!

600
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:34,121
Whom are they looking for?

601
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,626
Will someone tell me
what's so lovely upstairs?

602
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:59,648
Lucky, you understand?

603
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:03,617
Both the families are
eager to see your wife.

604
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,620
- Both families. Anything else?
- Next...

605
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:13,629
...folks in the neighbourhood.
We ought to sell tickets.

606
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:20,636
We can bring the families close...

607
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:23,137
...on the pretext of
introducing the bride.

608
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:26,140
Bride?

609
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:35,651
One other thing, Lucky.
We won't use the ploy.

610
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:39,687
- Why Raja?
- Because she's brainless.

611
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,188
Indecorous.

612
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:42,690
Insolent.

613
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:46,194
She's a mischief-maker.
Given that sanction...

614
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:51,198
...she will become my wife.
I'm not going to tolerate her.

615
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:59,208
Besides, she isn't even educated.
She's no match for Raja!

616
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:16,191
Are you dancing in the rain?

617
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:20,695
You got to be mad enough to do it.

618
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:25,200
Where are my certificates?

619
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:31,707
- Uncle, who took my certificates?
- Shut up!

620
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:37,713
I know of nothing outside music.

621
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:41,716
Banto cleaned the drawers.
She might know.

622
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:46,720
Where have you kept
my certificates?

623
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:51,259
- You mean those pieces of paper?
- Pieces of paper?

624
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:55,262
Strange! And I thought you're
intelligent enough to know...

625
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:58,765
...that trash goes
in the garbage can.

626
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:03,202
Trash? Oh, you'd never know...

627
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:05,206
...what labours went
into those certificates.

628
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:09,711
You're right. I'm a brainless,
indecorous, stupid thing.

629
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:13,213
How would I know
certificates from trash.

630
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:14,715
- So...
- So?

631
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:18,751
I wanted to make a fire for
tanning Ghuman's percussions.

632
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:23,725
- No, you never did that!
- No I thought...

633
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,760
I'd put the certificates on fire.

634
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,261
But you never did that?

635
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:33,268
- Why should I tell you?
- Tell me or I'll strangle you!

636
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:35,269
I'll tell you!

637
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:40,275
Oh there comes Ghuman Uncle.

638
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:47,783
- Help!
- I'm not going to spare you!

639
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:52,320
I'm no Raja unless I strangle you!

640
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:05,767
- Are you Banto Betty's husband?
- Who said?

641
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:09,269
She said that the guy standing
like a servant at the door...

642
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:10,771
...is her husband
- Did she say that?

643
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:14,275
Get these medicines.

644
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:20,781
It's just a sprain, nothing else.

645
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:23,818
Will I recover by tonight?

646
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,321
By tonight, you'll be
dancing like Madhuri Dixit.

647
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:31,291
No, I'm a Sridevi fan.

648
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:05,327
Heartless savages!
She danced like a doe!

649
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:08,829
She has lost her
leg because of you!

650
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:11,832
Can you replace that leg?

651
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:15,335
How? Had it been a chicken leg...

652
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:16,370
What did you say?

653
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:20,841
- I would've sacrificed an extra.
- Shut up!

654
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:24,845
I can have you jailed!

655
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:29,884
No! Don't!
I won't be able to pay for bail.

656
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,386
Besides, my life's
philosophy is to love...

657
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:38,393
"Give him love even if he is cruel"

658
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:40,895
Even I feel like singing.

659
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:53,909
Despite your antics,
she's on your side.

660
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:57,411
That's the ideal woman.
Wonderful, my child.

661
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:00,346
Such a lofty ideal,
such simple words.

662
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:03,384
No ideal.
That was a song in a movie.

663
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:05,886
- Don't jump out of your pants.
- He's wearing shorts.

664
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:10,857
Incorrigible, are you?
What do I do with these guys?

665
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:13,894
Don't worry, my child.
I won't have them sent to jail.

666
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:17,898
I'll have them thrown out.
Out of this house.

667
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:23,404
You'll render us homeless?
Now who's cruel? You or I?

668
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:25,406
I... no you.

669
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:36,407
Listen... if they ever play
dirty again... just sing Uncle.

670
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:40,454
And I'll do what I
can possibly never do.

671
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:47,963
Excuse me, it's time
for my singing practice.

672
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:55,469
Listen...

673
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,472
Will you come over here, please?

674
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:06,414
- Yes, what is it?
- One... two... three...

675
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:10,451
- Cut it out.
- First, will you tell me whether...

676
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:13,454
...they ought to be
washed separately.

677
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:15,956
Looks like polyester.

678
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:17,958
- A detergent wash will do, right?
- Yes

679
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:19,459
Then do that.

680
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:24,966
I mean, buy some detergent,
wash them, put them out to dry.

681
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:27,468
- Your clothes?
- We wash them?

682
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:36,477
Is someone's absence
not being felt?

683
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:38,979
- Not at all
- Uncle's absence?

684
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:44,985
Before I call out to him, think.

685
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:48,022
How would it be if you're homeless?

686
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:52,026
- No one else will put us up.
- Yes, uncles' orders.

687
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,528
Then we're banished!

688
01:08:55,097 --> 01:08:58,533
Madam, let's have the clothes,
let's not waste time.

689
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,474
My veil...

690
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:10,979
- Came away with the laundry.
- No problem.

691
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:14,482
Look at this lovely design.

692
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:20,988
- I like this one.
- Sorry, she's taken it already.

693
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:34,034
Raja! How come you're here?

694
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:38,039
Must've walked into a
boutique looking for a shave?

695
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:40,540
She too?

696
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:42,543
Grannie! You're here?

697
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:45,045
- My respects.
- What are you doing here?

698
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:48,049
Select a dress.
I'll pay for it.

699
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:58,092
- How much is this?
- 635 Rupees.

700
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:04,099
- Less how much discount?
- It doesn't qualify for discount

701
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,600
25 percent discount on
purchases of 1000 and above.

702
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:10,103
- Shopping done?
- Yes, this is worth 800.

703
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,606
Just 800?
You won't get a discount.

704
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:15,610
No problem, put it on my bill.

705
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:18,111
- What for?
- Just do it.

706
01:10:20,182 --> 01:10:22,150
Grandma, put that on my bill.

707
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:28,155
Will you bill all these together?

708
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:30,157
Why together?

709
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:34,162
- What are you upto?
- Have patience. Hurry, please.

710
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:40,168
Here's your dress.
And this is yours.

711
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:46,174
Your dress is worth 800.
Here's your discount. 200 Rupees.

712
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:52,681
Yours is worth 635.
Discount, 158.75. Here you are.

713
01:10:53,749 --> 01:11:00,621
Wonderful! You've saved
358.75 out of two dresses.

714
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:04,659
Grandma-Grannie, that was peanuts.

715
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:08,161
If you can go through
life together...

716
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:11,665
...there will be big gains.
Think about it.

717
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:35,689
- Raja, is tea ready?
- Boiling.

718
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:42,731
- Have you given her medicine?
- I'll do it right away.

719
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:49,738
Raja, you're looking frustrated.
Why don't you take something?

720
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:51,738
- Take what?
- Poison.

721
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:58,246
Raja, I feel like crying for you.

722
01:11:58,347 --> 01:12:01,680
Here you are, holed
up with a crackpot.

723
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:05,220
And a girl comes out of nowhere
and latches on to you...

724
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:09,223
...and you end up washing,
cooking for her.

725
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:11,725
In life you got to struggle a bit.

726
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:14,227
Until such time
that she recovers...

727
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:18,232
...till she begins walking,
I'd rather say jumping...

728
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:21,735
- I go to do this, no?
- She is jumping.

729
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:28,743
- God! Am I dreaming?
- Reality.

730
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:54,302
Aren't you ashamed?
You faked that limp.

731
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:57,799
And here you are,
on the terrace, skipping.

732
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:05,245
- Because you work miracles.
- What did you say?

733
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:17,791
"Maverick"

734
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:01,300
"You're maverick, I'm maverick..."

735
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:02,802
"Maverick because of you"

736
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:04,805
"I've given myself to you"

737
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:09,310
"Let me walk with you"

738
01:14:09,878 --> 01:14:13,314
"Colour me in your hues"

739
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:20,821
"Maverick-maverick"

740
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:24,357
"You're king, I'm queen.
I'm as fun-loving as you are"

741
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,860
"You're my paramour,
you drive me crazy..."

742
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:30,363
"I know who you are,
you're my heartbeat"

743
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:36,871
"You're my beloved,
I pine for you"

744
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:40,373
"Colour me in your hues"

745
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:47,882
"Maverick-maverick"

746
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:31,392
"Come home to me, my love.
An easterly wind is scorching me"

747
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:40,936
"Hear my love, the chime in
my anklets, in my bangles..."

748
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,936
"...call out to you"

749
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:50,445
"For your sake I'm a maverick"

750
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:53,447
"Maverick-maverick"

751
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:58,453
"For your sake I suffer"

752
01:15:58,587 --> 01:16:01,420
"Maverick-maverick"

753
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:09,930
"What craze drives me to
passion even after I'm sated?"

754
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:13,934
"Now that you've taken
me in your arms..."

755
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:19,941
"...set me afire.
Colour me in your hues"

756
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:27,448
"Maverick-maverick"

757
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:58,002
"Don't love me so much,
you crazy girl..."

758
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:03,950
"...lest our romance..."

759
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:07,988
"...becomes the legend..."

760
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:19,490
"...of the girl who
gave up everything..."

761
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:25,005
"...and she left her home..."

762
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:29,009
"...to become a maverick"

763
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:39,009
"Now she's so lost in love..."

764
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:46,026
"...she has created..."

765
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:51,064
"...a legend anew"

766
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:57,071
"You're maverick, I'm maverick..."

767
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:58,571
"Maverick because of you"

768
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,505
"I've given myself to you"

769
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:04,011
"Let me walk with you"

770
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:08,516
"Colour me in your hues"

771
01:18:20,128 --> 01:18:24,064
"Maverick-maverick"

772
01:19:00,202 --> 01:19:03,069
After accidents, people
end up in hospitals.

773
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:05,071
You end up dreaming?

774
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:09,577
Lucky for me, I might've
ended up in jail.

775
01:19:10,145 --> 01:19:13,581
Rise, madam.
That dance must've been tiring.

776
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:15,582
Go home, rest yourself.

777
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:17,617
No, I'm not tired at all.

778
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:22,417
Lucky, I'm in a strange dilemma.
She started out playing wife.

779
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:31,130
What's this woman getting me into?

780
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:32,632
You deserve it.

781
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:37,137
- Hit me once more... idea!
- What?

782
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:41,642
If she insists she's your wife,
what's holding you back?

783
01:19:41,743 --> 01:19:43,142
I don't get it.

784
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:50,184
For the first time,
you've given me a great idea!

785
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:53,186
If you weren't smelly,
I would've hugged you.

786
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:04,198
Why are they carrying in flowers?

787
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:08,201
Will you please
plait my hair first?

788
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:16,711
"Let it rain flowers,
my beloved has come to me"

789
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:22,216
Looks like a bed
for a nuptial night!

790
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:25,252
It's meant for the nuptial night.

791
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:29,255
- Nuptial night? Whose?
- Ours. Yours and mine.

792
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:30,757
Really?

793
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:35,763
- What? Ours?
- Who else? Ghuman Uncle's?

794
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:39,266
Aunt, it's been 3 months
since we got married.

795
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:44,271
But we haven't had
our nuptial night

796
01:20:44,372 --> 01:20:46,772
- Actually, they forgot.
- Unbelievable, no?

797
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,274
Come on Lucky, we've work to do.

798
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:50,778
Never had the nuptial night?

799
01:20:50,879 --> 01:20:53,780
No wonder the two of you
fight like cats and dogs.

800
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:57,318
- Actually...
- This is no good, my child.

801
01:20:57,419 --> 01:21:01,753
You're right. Will you help her
get dressed for our first night?

802
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,757
- Yes, come on.
- You don't know a thing.

803
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:14,268
I sent them away to watch a movie.

804
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:18,772
The movie is nearly over,
and my movie is still to begin.

805
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:22,275
- How right!
- Then ask her to get dressed.

806
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:25,779
Here's the bride's trousseau
and a make-up pack. For her.

807
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:27,781
- Lucky, flowers done?
- Done.

808
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:29,282
Oh no...
- One minute!

809
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:32,319
- Don't forget the lipstick!
- I won't.

810
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:35,821
- Come on.
- How do I explain this?

811
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:49,336
- Stop it!
- Oh come on.

812
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:52,339
Now look at her.

813
01:21:57,412 --> 01:21:59,346
- Ready?
- Aunt...

814
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:00,311
Not a word.

815
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:02,282
What are you doing here?
Come on, out.

816
01:22:07,389 --> 01:22:08,321
Aunt!

817
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:26,340
- What do you intend doing?
- Whatever husband does to wife.

818
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:33,347
You fancy being wife?
Come, let's make a wife out of you.

819
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:38,385
Please! Don't touch me!
I beg of you.

820
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:40,386
I lied about being your wife!

821
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:43,891
If you want,
I'll say it to everyone.

822
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:49,896
May I know why you did all this?

823
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:54,401
Miss Universe crown
or a gold medal...

824
01:22:54,502 --> 01:22:59,405
...a girl will wear anything,
but not the wedding necklace...

825
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:02,840
...not unless she is married,
in observance of the rituals.

826
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:07,347
Tell me the truth.
Who are you, why this melodrama?

827
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:12,352
- Why are you fooling everyone?
- If I'm fooling people...

828
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:16,389
...what are you upto?
Have you not deceived them?

829
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:19,892
You claim to be Anjali's
son, their grandson?

830
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:22,896
What nonsense are you talking?

831
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:34,908
Do you know the others in
this photograph with me?

832
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:37,410
- No.
- Have you ever seen them before?

833
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:41,415
- No.
- They are Anjali and Anthony.

834
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:43,416
The ones whose son
you are impersonating

835
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:48,421
Anjali and Anthony never had a son.

836
01:23:48,556 --> 01:23:51,957
They have an only daughter.
That's me!

837
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:01,900
My real name isn't Banto.
I'm Tina.

838
01:24:02,971 --> 01:24:04,905
Now tell me who you are.

839
01:24:40,442 --> 01:24:46,381
Even my grandparents
haven't kept track...

840
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:50,383
...of my parents for
the last 27 years.

841
01:24:50,518 --> 01:24:54,921
But we were always aware of
whatever was happening to them.

842
01:24:57,492 --> 01:25:01,360
Do you know how?
Only one man rose to their support...

843
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:04,364
...while everyone in the village
was against their marriage.

844
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:05,398
Ghuman Uncle.

845
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:12,873
Never did we miss one
letter from Ghuman Uncle.

846
01:25:13,441 --> 01:25:14,874
No one in the village...

847
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:18,377
...not even his wife knew
that he was writing to us.

848
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:23,383
He was the one who told us all
about you, including that song.

849
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:29,388
Now explain one thing.
Despite being a granddaughter...

850
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:33,426
...I never thought of bringing
the families together.

851
01:25:33,528 --> 01:25:38,431
How come you?
Someone who is unrelated?

852
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:39,932
Why are you so anxious?

853
01:25:45,507 --> 01:25:46,439
I mean...

854
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:49,442
...what makes someone with
such a grand personality...

855
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:52,445
...give up whatever he was doing?
Why're you here in this village?

856
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:55,448
Why so far removed from the city?
What's the truth?

857
01:25:56,017 --> 01:25:58,485
- Truth?
- Yes, truth.

858
01:25:59,053 --> 01:26:01,920
- The truth is somewhat strange.
- Strange?

859
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:04,924
Somewhat strange, somewhat bizarre.

860
01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:07,426
Why not lay it straight? It's fat.

861
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:09,929
What do you mean?

862
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:15,435
This persona wasn't always grand.

863
01:26:15,537 --> 01:26:20,941
He was somewhat of a comedian,
sweet, romantic, innocent, musical.

864
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:27,447
Yes Tina, like the flower,
I have a colourful past...

865
01:26:27,549 --> 01:26:29,949
...I never knew a family.

866
01:26:30,084 --> 01:26:35,488
Until a few months ago,
Raja was a different man.

867
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:41,996
Shapeless, heavy, gargantuan.
I knew I was nothing of a hero.

868
01:26:42,564 --> 01:26:46,500
But in my heart, I had carved
out a place for a heroine.

869
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:53,997
At first sight, I felt,
here's life's quintessence.

870
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:58,011
She was the one I was
always looking for.

871
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:02,448
She was so frivolous, so innocent.

872
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:03,949
She didn't even know that a
sweet romantic hulk has a heart.

873
01:27:07,589 --> 01:27:08,681
And there was that
only song I sang.

874
01:27:09,591 --> 01:27:17,498
"If you got love in your life,
you got everything"

875
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:22,502
"If you got no love..."

876
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:27,507
"...you got nothing"

877
01:27:28,576 --> 01:27:37,507
"If you got love in your eyes..."

878
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:42,522
"...you got everything"

879
01:27:42,657 --> 01:27:47,560
"If you got no love..."

880
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:52,566
"...you've got nothing"

881
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:57,570
"Love... love... love...
go on sharing love"

882
01:28:55,196 --> 01:28:58,131
"Just give it a try"

883
01:28:59,701 --> 01:29:02,568
"Even dreams come true"

884
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:07,073
"The world isn't a bad place"

885
01:29:09,644 --> 01:29:12,579
"There are nice souls on earth"

886
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:40,641
"If you got the desire..."

887
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:44,644
"you got everything"

888
01:29:44,746 --> 01:29:49,649
"If not the desire..."

889
01:29:50,752 --> 01:29:53,687
"...you got nothing"

890
01:29:54,756 --> 01:29:59,659
"If you got love in your life..."

891
01:29:59,794 --> 01:30:03,696
"...you got everything"

892
01:30:04,766 --> 01:30:08,702
"If you got no love..."

893
01:30:09,771 --> 01:30:13,707
"...you got nothing"

894
01:30:14,776 --> 01:30:18,712
"Love... love... love...
go on sharing love"

895
01:30:34,829 --> 01:30:37,764
- Where are you going?
- Inside the hostel...

896
01:30:37,865 --> 01:30:40,265
- There's a girl singing!
- So?

897
01:30:40,368 --> 01:30:41,767
I got to see her!

898
01:30:41,869 --> 01:30:45,771
Boys can't enter a girls'
hostel without permission.

899
01:30:45,873 --> 01:30:49,775
I live in the neighbourhood
and she's singing my song.

900
01:30:49,877 --> 01:30:52,277
- I'll be right back.
- Out... out!

901
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:57,284
God, You are my father,
my godfather.

902
01:30:57,885 --> 01:31:00,752
I majored in the arts and sciences.

903
01:31:00,855 --> 01:31:02,254
And then I mastered music.

904
01:31:02,356 --> 01:31:04,756
But You have not provided
me with a job yet.

905
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:11,765
I'm going for an interview again
God, please let me have the job.

906
01:31:13,835 --> 01:31:14,767
Oblations.

907
01:31:33,888 --> 01:31:37,790
Help! I'm about to score
a big zero in maths.

908
01:31:44,899 --> 01:31:47,834
- Your paper!
- Don't worry, I have more

909
01:31:50,404 --> 01:31:52,338
This is the answer
according to my notes.

910
01:32:07,889 --> 01:32:10,323
But my answer is
quite something else.

911
01:32:11,893 --> 01:32:18,321
- Maybe the book is wrong?
- Do something! Help me.

912
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:22,836
I'm about to fail my term!
Don't do like this.

913
01:32:24,906 --> 01:32:28,842
What's the answer?
Why isn't my mind working?

914
01:32:31,913 --> 01:32:33,847
It came back?

915
01:32:47,962 --> 01:32:48,894
Who solved it?

916
01:32:50,965 --> 01:32:53,900
- You?
- Not I, the guy in blue.

917
01:32:54,001 --> 01:33:00,338
The one in the blue?
Listen... Mr Blue.

918
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:09,850
Aren't you the one in the
neighbourhood who writes songs?

919
01:33:12,954 --> 01:33:15,889
But my problem is something
else, I need your help

920
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:18,390
But I'm getting late...

921
01:33:18,492 --> 01:33:21,893
I got an exam!
I'm about to fail.

922
01:33:40,982 --> 01:33:45,419
- Your books...
- Sorry, you fell because of me.

923
01:33:45,553 --> 01:33:51,924
- No, you fell because of me.
- Wonderful! We both fell.

924
01:34:01,969 --> 01:34:04,904
I'm Florence. I live in the
hostel in front of your house.

925
01:34:05,006 --> 01:34:07,907
I'm Raja, I live in the house
in front of your hostel.

926
01:34:08,976 --> 01:34:12,412
Wonderful!
We live in front of each other.

927
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:14,413
Here's my stop.

928
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:39,973
The interviews are over.

929
01:34:42,043 --> 01:34:43,977
I got delayed trying
to help someone.

930
01:34:44,078 --> 01:34:48,981
If you try to help others rather
of helping yourself, you lose.

931
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:53,019
No, helping others is better
than helping yourself.

932
01:34:57,091 --> 01:35:00,424
- Will you see my certificates?
- What for? Get lost.

933
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:03,962
Very well.

934
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:19,979
Think! If we can't win the music
contest, we're in disgrace.

935
01:35:24,085 --> 01:35:26,019
You maxed the maths paper.

936
01:35:27,588 --> 01:35:32,491
- We got a new problem now.
- Why not get Raja to solve this?

937
01:35:44,105 --> 01:35:48,542
- Raja! Give up praying!
- What's your problem Lucky?

938
01:35:48,642 --> 01:35:52,043
- The moneylender is calling his loan.
- Now what?

939
01:35:52,146 --> 01:35:54,546
You got the brains, you think.

940
01:35:54,648 --> 01:35:57,048
What about my money?

941
01:35:57,184 --> 01:36:00,517
Not up in the morning,
have a heart.

942
01:36:00,621 --> 01:36:01,553
My heart goes out to you!

943
01:36:01,655 --> 01:36:03,020
But there's something I got to say.

944
01:36:03,124 --> 01:36:09,529
Not a word!
Everytime you send me packing.

945
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:14,533
- This time, I'll go packing.
- After you've returned my money.

946
01:36:15,102 --> 01:36:18,538
Look, I'm going for an interview.
As soon as I land a job...

947
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:22,040
...I'll return your money.
- We'll even lend to you

948
01:36:22,143 --> 01:36:24,043
- At two percent!
- Very good rate.

949
01:36:25,112 --> 01:36:27,546
What guarantee you'll bag a job?

950
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:29,548
Here's guarantee.

951
01:36:29,683 --> 01:36:31,583
He has majored in arts,
sciences and music.

952
01:36:31,685 --> 01:36:34,586
Few have as many merit
certificates as he has.

953
01:36:34,688 --> 01:36:37,088
Will the certificates
ensure the job?

954
01:36:37,191 --> 01:36:39,591
Hundred percent!

955
01:36:41,162 --> 01:36:46,099
You can take the file back
after you return my money.

956
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:53,106
- Stop! Please! Don't do this!
- If you don't pay me in 2 days...

957
01:36:53,207 --> 01:36:57,109
- I'll burn this file!
- This is a matter of my career.

958
01:36:57,211 --> 01:37:01,045
My certificates!
My life's work... please.

959
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:06,085
Lucky, we're going
through a bad patch.

960
01:37:06,654 --> 01:37:08,588
Looks like bad stars.

961
01:37:08,689 --> 01:37:14,594
I can't find a job and I got to
pay the moneylender & milkman.

962
01:37:14,695 --> 01:37:16,595
- You're forgetting one thing.
- Which?

963
01:37:16,697 --> 01:37:18,096
House rent.

964
01:37:28,175 --> 01:37:35,104
This is worse than the worst
introduction in Hindi movies.

965
01:37:35,216 --> 01:37:36,615
Get lost!

966
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:40,151
This is no way to
get rid of people.

967
01:37:40,254 --> 01:37:44,156
- Looks like he hasn't paid rent.
- Poor guy.

968
01:37:44,258 --> 01:37:47,159
Nothing of the sort.
I pay 5,000 every month.

969
01:37:47,261 --> 01:37:49,661
- Shut up!
- But what's his mistake?

970
01:37:50,231 --> 01:37:52,165
Not mistake, call it crime.

971
01:37:52,266 --> 01:37:55,167
All day he bores us
with his sick stories.

972
01:37:55,269 --> 01:37:57,669
Wants to go to Bombay, write films.

973
01:37:57,771 --> 01:38:00,171
And all night, he snores.

974
01:38:00,241 --> 01:38:04,610
Are you throwing him out over
something so trivial? Too bad!

975
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:09,615
I'd rather sell my house
than let him live with me.

976
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:12,150
Get lost! Yours isn't
the only house in town.

977
01:38:12,253 --> 01:38:15,654
- Cash finds me another place.
- Go on, do it.

978
01:38:22,229 --> 01:38:25,164
- Sir, you want a house?
- You got one?

979
01:38:25,266 --> 01:38:27,666
Yes, but I didn't bring the
house along. Will a cottage do?

980
01:38:27,768 --> 01:38:30,669
Anything will do, this is
a matter of my prestige.

981
01:38:30,771 --> 01:38:35,674
- We're already living there.
- No problem, I'll adjust.

982
01:38:35,776 --> 01:38:36,708
Do you have a fan?

983
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:39,677
- Not fan, fans.
- Separate bathrooms?

984
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:42,681
- The room is in the bathroom.
- One minute...

985
01:38:42,783 --> 01:38:44,182
Excuse me.

986
01:38:44,318 --> 01:38:47,719
Lucky, are you out of your mind?
You'll let him live with us?

987
01:38:47,821 --> 01:38:51,723
Only as long as he's worth it.

988
01:38:51,825 --> 01:38:54,726
First, we take a 5,000 advance
And we pay Khan off.

989
01:38:54,828 --> 01:38:56,728
And we make him foot the rent.

990
01:38:56,830 --> 01:38:59,731
He pays rent, we keep the place.

991
01:39:07,241 --> 01:39:11,678
Welcome to our heaven!

992
01:39:15,249 --> 01:39:18,685
Where are the fans?

993
01:39:18,819 --> 01:39:23,722
He's an Abhishek Bachchan fan &
the landlord is the maid's fan

994
01:39:23,824 --> 01:39:29,228
Damn! This ruin costs 1,500 a month
and 5,000 advance? Goodbye!

995
01:39:29,330 --> 01:39:30,729
- Hey film star...
- Yes?

996
01:39:30,831 --> 01:39:34,733
This was where the greatest
of directors sat down...

997
01:39:34,835 --> 01:39:37,736
...to write their greatest stories.
- They came here?

998
01:39:38,305 --> 01:39:41,240
- Then you surely know them?
- Of course I do.

999
01:39:41,342 --> 01:39:43,242
They won't know us but
that's besides the point.

1000
01:39:43,344 --> 01:39:44,743
What kind of an
acquaintance is that?

1001
01:39:44,845 --> 01:39:47,746
He means someday you'll
become a big film writer.

1002
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:53,253
You got me a bit emotional.
Here's your advance.

1003
01:39:53,387 --> 01:39:54,786
Thank you very much.

1004
01:39:54,888 --> 01:39:57,789
- Come on Lucky, we made it.
- What was that he said?

1005
01:39:58,359 --> 01:40:00,793
Let's get the certificates back.

1006
01:40:00,894 --> 01:40:02,521
- Raja, here's your file
- Where did you find this file?

1007
01:40:05,899 --> 01:40:08,732
Florence gave it to me.

1008
01:40:27,421 --> 01:40:32,324
"If you got love in your life..."

1009
01:40:32,459 --> 01:40:36,361
"...you got everything"

1010
01:40:37,431 --> 01:40:41,367
"If you got no love..."

1011
01:40:42,436 --> 01:40:46,372
"...you got nothing"

1012
01:40:46,940 --> 01:40:56,372
"If you got love in your eyes..."

1013
01:40:56,950 --> 01:41:00,317
"...you got everything"

1014
01:41:01,422 --> 01:41:05,324
"If you have no love..."

1015
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:10,363
"...you've got nothing"

1016
01:41:11,432 --> 01:41:16,369
"Love... love... love...
go on sharing love"

1017
01:41:20,941 --> 01:41:27,369
She was rehearsing here a while
ago. Maybe in her college.

1018
01:41:27,481 --> 01:41:28,880
- In college?
- Yes.

1019
01:41:34,488 --> 01:41:37,889
"Some fragrance on my breath..."

1020
01:41:39,493 --> 01:41:42,428
"some restlessness this season..."

1021
01:41:44,498 --> 01:41:52,428
"some flower will blossom in
my heart, whispers someone"

1022
01:42:15,496 --> 01:42:23,426
"If spring has come to your
Eden you got everything"

1023
01:42:24,505 --> 01:42:33,937
"If the Spring hasn't come,
you got nothing"

1024
01:42:34,515 --> 01:42:39,452
"If you got love in your life..."

1025
01:42:40,554 --> 01:42:43,489
"...you got everything"

1026
01:42:54,568 --> 01:42:55,500
"Love... love... love...

1027
01:42:55,602 --> 01:42:57,502
- There is no one here.
- Where must they be?

1028
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:05,945
- 3 tickets.
- Three? For whom?

1029
01:43:06,046 --> 01:43:07,946
One for you, two for him.

1030
01:43:08,515 --> 01:43:11,484
"Some dream stirs within me..."

1031
01:43:13,554 --> 01:43:16,489
"some passion is aroused..."

1032
01:43:18,559 --> 01:43:20,993
"loneliness is no more..."

1033
01:43:22,563 --> 01:43:26,499
"the season of love beckons"

1034
01:43:48,622 --> 01:43:57,553
"If spring makes the bud
blossom you got everything"

1035
01:43:58,632 --> 01:44:07,506
"If there's no blossom,
you got nothing"

1036
01:44:08,575 --> 01:44:13,512
"Love... love... love...
go on sharing love"

1037
01:44:25,626 --> 01:44:27,059
Now I talk to Florence.

1038
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:33,566
- May I talk to Florence?
- One minute.

1039
01:44:33,667 --> 01:44:34,599
Get lost.

1040
01:44:36,637 --> 01:44:40,073
Florence, I'm Raja from
across your hostel.

1041
01:44:44,144 --> 01:44:46,078
You know I was feted
at the college.

1042
01:44:48,649 --> 01:44:53,086
I ought to be thankful to you
for retrieving my certificates.

1043
01:44:53,220 --> 01:44:55,154
No! I ought to be thankful!

1044
01:44:55,255 --> 01:44:58,122
Thanks to your song,
I got the first prize.

1045
01:44:58,225 --> 01:45:00,125
I sang it at home.

1046
01:45:00,227 --> 01:45:03,060
You took it to TV, you've
taken it all over the country.

1047
01:45:06,633 --> 01:45:10,569
Florence, can I meet you?
Outside the hostel gates?

1048
01:45:14,641 --> 01:45:17,075
I'll be right over.

1049
01:45:30,691 --> 01:45:34,092
- Yes?
- About my certificates...

1050
01:45:34,227 --> 01:45:36,627
Here's the money you paid for them.

1051
01:45:37,698 --> 01:45:39,131
Why are you returning this?

1052
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:43,636
Borrowing makes a
stranger, it's said.

1053
01:45:43,737 --> 01:45:47,639
With Khan it's different I
don't want us to be estranged.

1054
01:45:47,741 --> 01:45:52,644
Nor do I wish it.
I'll accept it.

1055
01:45:57,751 --> 01:45:58,683
One minute...

1056
01:46:03,690 --> 01:46:11,119
Thanks to you,
I passed maths But...

1057
01:46:11,231 --> 01:46:14,632
Other weak subjects? Which?

1058
01:46:15,702 --> 01:46:19,638
- All of them
- All? Oh God!

1059
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:25,645
Actually, the lectures are boring.

1060
01:46:25,746 --> 01:46:27,145
By the time I'm
attentive again...

1061
01:46:27,247 --> 01:46:28,646
...it's time for the exams.

1062
01:46:28,749 --> 01:46:32,685
There's very little time left &
the nervousness makes me dumb.

1063
01:46:35,756 --> 01:46:38,190
Oh what might you
be thinking of me?

1064
01:46:38,291 --> 01:46:40,691
I'm so utterly worthless.

1065
01:46:40,794 --> 01:46:45,697
No you aren't, because that's
the critique of the self.

1066
01:46:46,767 --> 01:46:49,702
That means you'll help me
with the rest of my subjects?

1067
01:46:51,271 --> 01:46:52,203
Sure.

1068
01:48:17,824 --> 01:48:20,759
- What are you discussing?
- Dream girls.

1069
01:48:20,861 --> 01:48:23,261
Tell us, what kind of
a guy would you like?

1070
01:48:26,333 --> 01:48:30,770
I don't go for looks. Whatever
the looks, whatever the size...

1071
01:48:30,871 --> 01:48:33,772
...he must be good at heart.
And most importantly...

1072
01:48:33,874 --> 01:48:36,775
...he must be brilliant!

1073
01:48:36,877 --> 01:48:39,778
Intelligent enough to
leave me dumbfounded.

1074
01:48:46,887 --> 01:48:48,821
Hey fatso, can't you watch it?

1075
01:48:50,891 --> 01:48:54,292
- Whom did you call fatso?
- He's fat. So I called fatso.

1076
01:48:56,897 --> 01:49:02,767
Remember, if you laugh at someone
who's fat, you're a fathead.

1077
01:49:02,869 --> 01:49:05,770
Someone who's fat can slim down.

1078
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:10,776
But what do you do about
your brains, fathead?

1079
01:49:53,954 --> 01:49:55,888
Whom did you call a fatso?

1080
01:50:05,966 --> 01:50:09,402
My Raja is fat and that's
what he did to you.

1081
01:50:09,502 --> 01:50:11,902
What'd happen to you
if he was in shape?

1082
01:50:54,047 --> 01:50:57,983
My Raja is fat and that's
what he did to you.

1083
01:50:58,118 --> 01:51:00,018
What'd happen to you
if he was in shape?

1084
01:51:15,035 --> 01:51:19,472
Raja, what are you upto? Breaking
coconuts or breaking the temple?

1085
01:51:19,572 --> 01:51:21,972
- Coconuts.
- What gives?

1086
01:51:22,075 --> 01:51:25,977
No more going to bed hungry,
no more borrowing.

1087
01:51:26,079 --> 01:51:29,480
No more tramping,
I've found a job.

1088
01:51:29,582 --> 01:51:31,482
- Job?
- Yes, a job!

1089
01:51:34,087 --> 01:51:40,492
Now find a nice girl
and get married, fast.

1090
01:51:40,627 --> 01:51:43,528
- Why go looking, there's a girl.
- Who?

1091
01:51:44,597 --> 01:51:48,533
Look Raja, you like Florence.
Florence likes you.

1092
01:51:48,635 --> 01:51:52,537
Before she leaves for vacations,
proposition her.

1093
01:51:52,639 --> 01:51:56,541
My intentions are quite different.

1094
01:51:57,110 --> 01:51:59,544
Before she returns
after holidays...

1095
01:51:59,646 --> 01:52:02,979
...I want to make
myself worthy of her.

1096
01:52:07,087 --> 01:52:10,989
Just pray to God that
she is given to me.

1097
01:53:11,151 --> 01:53:15,554
"Tell me o'heart
you surely know..."

1098
01:53:25,165 --> 01:53:30,603
"...how do I get my girl?"

1099
01:53:35,175 --> 01:53:37,609
"Oh how do I get her?"

1100
01:54:17,183 --> 01:54:20,619
"I'm in love with a girl"

1101
01:54:21,221 --> 01:54:25,624
"Will she love me?"

1102
01:54:26,726 --> 01:54:30,162
"In the images in my dreams..."

1103
01:54:31,231 --> 01:54:35,167
"will she add a touch of colour?"

1104
01:54:36,236 --> 01:54:40,172
"Will it ever come to be?"

1105
01:54:46,246 --> 01:54:50,182
"What will be the outcome?"

1106
01:54:51,284 --> 01:54:54,685
"Good or bad?"

1107
01:54:55,288 --> 01:55:00,191
"Tell me o'heart you surely know"

1108
01:55:44,304 --> 01:55:47,740
"My heart's desire..."

1109
01:55:49,309 --> 01:55:52,244
"...will it be fulfilled?"

1110
01:55:53,313 --> 01:55:57,249
"I'm crazy about someone"

1111
01:55:58,351 --> 01:56:02,185
"...will she be mine?"

1112
01:56:03,289 --> 01:56:12,220
"Will we walk together
hand in hand?"

1113
01:56:13,299 --> 01:56:15,733
"What will happen in the end?"

1114
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:22,240
"O'heart, don't hide it from me"

1115
01:56:22,809 --> 01:56:27,246
"Tell me o'heart you surely know"

1116
01:57:36,382 --> 01:57:41,820
- Hi Mr Writer!
- Back from the holidays?

1117
01:57:46,426 --> 01:57:51,363
- Where's Raja?
- Nowadays he vanishes early.

1118
01:57:51,464 --> 01:57:52,863
- Vanishes?
- Yes.

1119
01:57:56,436 --> 01:58:00,805
I'm throwing a party tomorrow.
All of you are invited.

1120
01:58:02,375 --> 01:58:06,812
Florence, can't you stay
back to look up Raja?

1121
01:58:06,913 --> 01:58:09,814
To look up Raja?
But I've looked him up already.

1122
01:58:11,918 --> 01:58:18,323
No Florence, I mean, maybe
you could talk face-to-face.

1123
01:58:19,425 --> 01:58:21,359
We'll do that.
Tomorrow.

1124
01:58:25,431 --> 01:58:27,865
What was that about
looking him up?

1125
01:58:32,438 --> 01:58:35,373
Raja, why didn't you come up?
You could've proposed today.

1126
01:58:35,475 --> 01:58:37,875
No, Florence is right.
Tomorrow.

1127
01:58:37,977 --> 01:58:40,878
For such occasions... you
need the right costume...

1128
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:43,881
...right lighting, right location.

1129
01:59:09,442 --> 01:59:12,377
- Where's Raja?
- You know, in Hindi movies...

1130
01:59:12,478 --> 01:59:14,378
...the hero makes a grand entry.

1131
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:17,881
Cut out the jokes, where is Raja?

1132
01:59:46,512 --> 01:59:50,448
You... how did you manage this?

1133
02:00:04,063 --> 02:00:06,497
This calls for a
double celebration!

1134
02:00:06,599 --> 02:00:08,499
I'll be back... one minute

1135
02:00:13,072 --> 02:00:16,508
Are you ready?
Say it, as soon as she comes.

1136
02:00:19,579 --> 02:00:22,013
- Who's here?
- Raja! I told you, no?

1137
02:00:28,621 --> 02:00:32,523
This is Raja, the one
who used to teach me.

1138
02:00:32,658 --> 02:00:36,560
You can't describe him as
anything less than brilliant.

1139
02:00:36,662 --> 02:00:40,564
And here's the guy whose
birthday we're celebrating.

1140
02:00:40,666 --> 02:00:43,567
Ranjit, my fiance.

1141
02:01:07,627 --> 02:01:09,561
Florence made her grades
because of you. Else...

1142
02:01:09,662 --> 02:01:11,562
...we wouldn't have been
married for another two years.

1143
02:01:14,133 --> 02:01:18,069
So Raja, how's my choice?
Aren't we made for each other?

1144
02:01:21,641 --> 02:01:24,576
Isn't he tall,
dashing and handsome.

1145
02:01:24,677 --> 02:01:27,077
Just like you said
Mr Right should be?

1146
02:01:27,179 --> 02:01:29,079
But in reply, you said
quite something else.

1147
02:01:29,181 --> 02:01:33,117
And that's why Raja...

1148
02:01:33,219 --> 02:01:37,121
My compliments.

1149
02:01:41,694 --> 02:01:45,130
Sorry Florence, I got
nothing to give you.

1150
02:01:46,699 --> 02:01:48,633
I wish you told me
about the occasion...

1151
02:01:52,705 --> 02:01:56,141
- My best wishes...
- I know I have your best wishes.

1152
02:01:58,711 --> 02:02:00,576
She knows nothing.

1153
02:03:10,716 --> 02:03:14,152
- Do you think Raja will agree?
- I'll bring him around.

1154
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:22,193
It's me, Florence.

1155
02:03:23,262 --> 02:03:27,198
- Why is she here so early?
- Raja teach her a lesson.

1156
02:03:27,299 --> 02:03:31,201
- Shut up and get dressed.
- Ruined my sleep.

1157
02:03:33,773 --> 02:03:39,211
- What brings you here so early?
- Raja, I need your help.

1158
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:45,216
We're getting married tomorrow,
without our parents consent.

1159
02:03:45,351 --> 02:03:50,254
I have no one else but you.
I want you to be a witness.

1160
02:03:52,324 --> 02:03:57,261
If you sign as witness, it'll be
your best gift for my wedding.

1161
02:03:59,331 --> 02:04:03,199
If my signature is what makes
you happy, I'll surely do it.

1162
02:04:03,769 --> 02:04:06,704
Ranjit didn't I tell you
that Raja will concede?

1163
02:04:12,778 --> 02:04:13,710
Florence, one minute.

1164
02:04:16,782 --> 02:04:21,719
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure, ask.

1165
02:04:21,854 --> 02:04:26,257
You have a family.
Then why this registered marriage?

1166
02:04:26,826 --> 02:04:29,260
Because our families
will never give consent.

1167
02:04:29,829 --> 02:04:30,761
But why?

1168
02:04:31,831 --> 02:04:36,268
27 years ago, my aunt eloped
with Florence's uncle.

1169
02:04:36,836 --> 02:04:39,270
Ever since, our families
have been at loggerheads.

1170
02:04:43,843 --> 02:04:48,280
It's your responsibility
to patch those differences.

1171
02:04:48,848 --> 02:04:50,782
You must not make the chasm wider.

1172
02:04:51,884 --> 02:04:53,317
I don't think it is nice...

1173
02:04:53,419 --> 02:04:58,823
...to hurt your parents who
reared you for 20 years...

1174
02:04:58,924 --> 02:05:01,256
...for the sake of
a 20-month affair.

1175
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:02,759
We don't want a bit of that.

1176
02:05:02,862 --> 02:05:05,262
But reasoning with our
families is impossible.

1177
02:05:05,364 --> 02:05:08,765
I'll make it possible,
I'll bring the families together.

1178
02:05:08,868 --> 02:05:11,268
I'll make sure that you're
married in their presence.

1179
02:05:13,839 --> 02:05:16,774
Don't you trust me?

1180
02:05:16,876 --> 02:05:18,275
Absolutely.

1181
02:05:18,377 --> 02:05:22,780
Florence insists that only Raja
can help failures succeed.

1182
02:05:23,849 --> 02:05:27,785
I say, only Raja can
turn hatred into love.

1183
02:05:29,889 --> 02:05:30,821
We'll be going.

1184
02:05:38,898 --> 02:05:41,332
Are you out of your mind?

1185
02:05:41,433 --> 02:05:43,333
You know she isn't
going to be yours.

1186
02:05:43,435 --> 02:05:45,335
Why must you do all this for her?

1187
02:05:50,409 --> 02:05:53,845
Lucky, loving is about giving.

1188
02:05:54,413 --> 02:06:02,286
Loving only someone who
belongs to me is narcissus.

1189
02:06:16,402 --> 02:06:22,830
In grief for the woman he loved,
an emperor built the Taj Mahal.

1190
02:06:22,942 --> 02:06:27,845
Men have died for love,
legends galore.

1191
02:06:28,914 --> 02:06:31,348
But this example of
so unique a gift...

1192
02:06:31,483 --> 02:06:36,386
...for the girl you
are losing is rare.

1193
02:06:37,957 --> 02:06:40,892
I thought of love
as only an emotion.

1194
02:06:41,961 --> 02:06:43,895
But now that I know
your intentions...

1195
02:06:43,996 --> 02:06:48,899
...I find a new respect for love.

1196
02:06:50,970 --> 02:06:57,899
All I will say is, from now on
your purpose is my purpose too.

1197
02:06:58,010 --> 02:07:03,846
Till such time that you succeed,
I will stand beside you.

1198
02:07:10,956 --> 02:07:15,359
Only one request.
For a while keep to yourself the fact...

1199
02:07:15,494 --> 02:07:18,895
...that I'm no grandson to
the Chaddhas and D'souzas.

1200
02:07:19,465 --> 02:07:21,399
I know everything.

1201
02:07:23,969 --> 02:07:27,405
You're a fraud playing grandson.

1202
02:07:27,973 --> 02:07:30,407
He heard story-screenplay
dialogues, the works.

1203
02:07:30,509 --> 02:07:33,410
Yes! Now I'll tell my
boss all about it and...

1204
02:07:33,512 --> 02:07:34,911
...I'm going to make
a film out of it.

1205
02:07:35,014 --> 02:07:36,413
Like someone who...

1206
02:07:36,515 --> 02:07:39,951
...watches movies for free & then
threatens to leak the suspense?

1207
02:07:40,052 --> 02:07:41,451
- Wait!
- Boss...

1208
02:07:41,553 --> 02:07:43,953
Lucky! Make sure he doesn't say!
Everything could be in a mess!

1209
02:07:44,056 --> 02:07:44,988
Get him!

1210
02:07:47,526 --> 02:07:48,458
Stop!

1211
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:49,959
No, if I stop, you'll catch me.

1212
02:07:50,062 --> 02:07:51,461
That's why I'm asking you to stop.

1213
02:07:51,563 --> 02:07:54,464
- What happened?
- He molested a girl.

1214
02:07:55,034 --> 02:07:55,966
Molestation?

1215
02:07:59,038 --> 02:08:00,403
Raped a girl!
Now he's getting away.

1216
02:08:02,975 --> 02:08:07,912
He raped and murdered a girl.
Now he's getting away.

1217
02:08:08,981 --> 02:08:09,913
Murder?

1218
02:08:12,017 --> 02:08:16,920
I molested a girl, I raped
her and I murdered her.

1219
02:08:17,056 --> 02:08:19,456
But how could I
have done all three?

1220
02:08:21,026 --> 02:08:23,460
Must tell the boss all about it.

1221
02:08:36,041 --> 02:08:39,477
No need for worry, he'll be
speechless for only 3 months.

1222
02:08:40,546 --> 02:08:43,481
Worrisome would've been
his ability to speak.

1223
02:08:43,582 --> 02:08:45,982
If he can't, no worries.

1224
02:08:46,118 --> 02:08:48,518
But he will start speaking, slowly.

1225
02:08:48,620 --> 02:08:50,520
For me, that's enough.

1226
02:08:54,093 --> 02:08:57,028
In this state is
drinking permissible?

1227
02:08:57,129 --> 02:08:58,061
Drinking? No.

1228
02:09:01,033 --> 02:09:01,965
You want a drink?

1229
02:09:03,035 --> 02:09:04,468
One drink is not enough?

1230
02:09:07,039 --> 02:09:08,973
You need a full bottle?

1231
02:09:10,042 --> 02:09:13,478
No, if this is the
way you behave...

1232
02:09:13,579 --> 02:09:16,480
...you won't even get
water for 3 months.

1233
02:09:24,089 --> 02:09:27,991
That was a wonderful thing to do
Now the road lies clear ahead.

1234
02:09:28,127 --> 02:09:30,027
And the target is in sight.

1235
02:09:31,096 --> 02:09:35,533
No cakes? Then I got to go to
town for the birthday cake.

1236
02:10:00,159 --> 02:10:02,093
The accident happened here.

1237
02:10:02,194 --> 02:10:03,593
How come the sound
is coming from there?

1238
02:10:06,165 --> 02:10:07,097
Grandpa.

1239
02:10:08,167 --> 02:10:11,102
You take care of that.
I'll take care of this.

1240
02:10:12,171 --> 02:10:13,103
Where are you headed?

1241
02:10:14,173 --> 02:10:20,112
Hi Grandpa! All dressed and
pushing the scooter? Where to?

1242
02:10:20,212 --> 02:10:23,113
You expect me to strip and
carry the scooter on my head?

1243
02:10:23,215 --> 02:10:25,115
- What happened to it?
- Tuberculosis.

1244
02:10:25,217 --> 02:10:27,151
- Tuberculosis?
- Out of gas.

1245
02:10:27,252 --> 02:10:29,152
- I know.
- What?

1246
02:10:29,254 --> 02:10:34,157
I mean, you should've checked
the gas before setting out.

1247
02:10:34,259 --> 02:10:36,659
- Give that to me.
- No...

1248
02:10:36,762 --> 02:10:39,663
You're old, Grandpa.

1249
02:10:39,765 --> 02:10:43,166
- The gas station is 5 kms away.
- What?

1250
02:10:43,735 --> 02:10:44,667
Five.

1251
02:10:45,737 --> 02:10:48,171
- Grandpa, are you all right?
- Perfectly.

1252
02:10:49,741 --> 02:10:52,175
- What happened?
- Grandpa D'souza's car.

1253
02:10:53,245 --> 02:10:56,180
Looks like a bad accident.

1254
02:10:57,749 --> 02:10:59,182
Must be dead.
Hundred percent.

1255
02:10:59,785 --> 02:11:02,652
- Careful.
- The old fool is alive.

1256
02:11:02,754 --> 02:11:05,154
- Grandpa, how do we go home?
- Walking.

1257
02:11:05,257 --> 02:11:11,162
You're old, Grandpa.
Home is 5 kilometers away.

1258
02:11:11,263 --> 02:11:13,163
- What?
- Five.

1259
02:11:13,265 --> 02:11:17,167
Goodness! I've had two
heart attacks already.

1260
02:11:17,269 --> 02:11:21,171
- What are you saying?
- Five kilometers on foot...

1261
02:11:21,273 --> 02:11:24,674
...won't take me home.
I'll end up there.

1262
02:11:24,776 --> 02:11:28,177
Grandpa! Idea!
You won't have to walk.

1263
02:11:30,749 --> 02:11:35,686
- What's wrong with the scooter?
- Just run out of gas.

1264
02:11:35,821 --> 02:11:41,225
What's the problem?
The car is full of gas. Just fill up.

1265
02:11:41,326 --> 02:11:46,229
- Why should I give him my gas?
- Alms.

1266
02:11:46,331 --> 02:11:51,234
- Alms?
- We don't need your alms.

1267
02:11:51,336 --> 02:11:57,241
We don't even take alms for free.
If you give us gas...

1268
02:11:57,342 --> 02:12:00,675
...we'll give you
a free lift home.

1269
02:12:00,779 --> 02:12:02,679
Yes, a lift... oh no, no.

1270
02:12:03,248 --> 02:12:06,684
Am I to give this old fool a lift?
Never.

1271
02:12:08,287 --> 02:12:10,221
Don't put on airs.

1272
02:12:10,322 --> 02:12:14,725
No matter how hungry he is,
the tiger never eats grass.

1273
02:12:14,826 --> 02:12:19,729
If he's tiger, this is lion!
He'll even kill his kin.

1274
02:12:19,831 --> 02:12:22,231
But he will never accept defeat!

1275
02:12:22,334 --> 02:12:24,234
Not even if it's a
matter of life and death.

1276
02:12:25,304 --> 02:12:28,239
I'm man enough.

1277
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:34,245
You're only man.
I got an additional qualification.

1278
02:12:34,346 --> 02:12:39,249
I'm a son of Punjab.
I'm resolute. I stand my ground.

1279
02:12:39,851 --> 02:12:43,252
Raja, I'm short of breath.
You tell him the rest.

1280
02:12:43,388 --> 02:12:50,294
Be man enough, be resolute.
27 years ago, his daughter eloped.

1281
02:12:50,395 --> 02:12:54,798
Ever since, he hasn't kept track
of her. Can you be more resolute

1282
02:12:56,868 --> 02:13:00,736
So what? He too hasn't
contacted his son ever since.

1283
02:13:00,839 --> 02:13:03,239
He doesn't even know
whether he's dead or alive.

1284
02:13:03,342 --> 02:13:05,742
Is that any less resolute?
Yes Grandpa?

1285
02:13:07,312 --> 02:13:13,251
He won't even help a dying
friend who's turned against him.

1286
02:13:13,385 --> 02:13:16,786
He will let him die thirsting
for a drop of water.

1287
02:13:16,888 --> 02:13:19,288
But he won't care
for the friendship.

1288
02:13:20,359 --> 02:13:22,293
In the name of religion
he will fight...

1289
02:13:22,394 --> 02:13:24,294
...he'll kill a friend.

1290
02:13:24,863 --> 02:13:27,798
He is slave to his resolution.

1291
02:13:32,371 --> 02:13:36,808
Shut up! I'm no slave
to intransigence.

1292
02:13:39,378 --> 02:13:41,312
The ones who enslave us...

1293
02:13:41,413 --> 02:13:45,816
...the one who deny us
our freedom are our sons.

1294
02:13:47,419 --> 02:13:55,326
Despite all my wishes,
I cannot meet her.

1295
02:13:57,429 --> 02:14:01,297
D'souza, I got no
complaints against you.

1296
02:14:26,425 --> 02:14:30,361
Scooter recharged.
Recharge your friendship.

1297
02:14:32,431 --> 02:14:37,368
The two of you make a
wonderful pair of friends.

1298
02:14:37,936 --> 02:14:39,870
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

1299
02:14:52,484 --> 02:14:58,389
What happened?

1300
02:15:00,425 --> 02:15:05,362
Why are you getting off midway?

1301
02:15:05,464 --> 02:15:09,867
In movies, there's
only one villain.

1302
02:15:09,968 --> 02:15:12,869
In real life, we
have 2 villains, no?

1303
02:15:13,438 --> 02:15:17,374
Right! If they see us together...

1304
02:15:17,476 --> 02:15:19,876
...they'll kill us
with a single bullet.

1305
02:15:19,978 --> 02:15:21,878
Don't say such ominous things!

1306
02:15:22,447 --> 02:15:26,884
We rode a scooter
together after 27 years.

1307
02:15:27,018 --> 02:15:29,919
And it was great fun.

1308
02:15:57,516 --> 02:16:00,883
Why are you so impatient?
What is the matter?

1309
02:16:09,494 --> 02:16:12,429
"Mr Chaddha,
Raja isn't your grandson"

1310
02:16:13,498 --> 02:16:17,434
- What's written in that?
- You can't read?

1311
02:16:17,536 --> 02:16:22,439
I left my reading glasses at home.

1312
02:16:26,511 --> 02:16:29,446
Rascal! A love letter for the nurse?
She's like your sister.

1313
02:16:32,017 --> 02:16:33,450
Not only love letter.

1314
02:16:33,585 --> 02:16:38,989
He even wants you to kill your
husband and elope with him.

1315
02:16:39,558 --> 02:16:44,495
Damn you! I'll show you.
No sparing you.

1316
02:16:49,568 --> 02:16:55,507
I egged the nurse on.
He won't ever talk again.

1317
02:16:58,577 --> 02:17:01,944
- Where are they running to?
- Looks like a film shooting.

1318
02:17:03,014 --> 02:17:04,447
Come on, let's take a look.

1319
02:17:10,555 --> 02:17:12,489
The Writer.

1320
02:17:21,566 --> 02:17:26,003
Wonderful! After so long!
How have you been?

1321
02:17:26,104 --> 02:17:29,005
We're fine.
But what are you doing?

1322
02:17:29,107 --> 02:17:30,506
Is your story being
made into a film?

1323
02:17:30,609 --> 02:17:35,012
Why not? The producer liked my
story immensely. He signed me...

1324
02:17:35,113 --> 02:17:37,013
...for story, screenplay,
dialogues, direction...

1325
02:17:37,115 --> 02:17:39,015
...music, lyrics, everything.

1326
02:17:41,620 --> 02:17:45,522
- You must be the hero too?
- Are you ridiculing me?

1327
02:17:45,657 --> 02:17:49,058
- What's your story?
- It's like this...

1328
02:17:52,631 --> 02:17:57,568
Forgive me, this isn't my story.
It is your story.

1329
02:18:00,572 --> 02:18:04,008
It's the story of the hero
who gives his heart...

1330
02:18:04,109 --> 02:18:08,011
...his whole life for
the sake of his girl.

1331
02:18:10,582 --> 02:18:14,518
But I'm not getting to
the end of this story.

1332
02:18:15,620 --> 02:18:18,589
Will the girl ever
appreciate her real hero?

1333
02:18:21,159 --> 02:18:26,062
Will the hero succeed in helping
her marry the man she loves?

1334
02:18:41,646 --> 02:18:45,082
- Are you telling the truth?
- I saw it with my own eyes.

1335
02:18:48,687 --> 02:18:51,622
You'll see, my words are true.

1336
02:18:53,692 --> 02:18:56,126
- Mine are.
- Let's see.

1337
02:19:02,634 --> 02:19:04,568
- We need your help.
- Why, what happened?

1338
02:19:05,136 --> 02:19:07,570
Ranjit wants us to
marry in a church.

1339
02:19:07,672 --> 02:19:10,072
And she wants to go to a temple.

1340
02:19:10,642 --> 02:19:16,080
Why don't you decide?
Draw the lot.

1341
02:19:26,691 --> 02:19:31,128
I have a third option for you.
The graveyard.

1342
02:19:33,698 --> 02:19:38,135
- Please, listen to me...
- I told you not to get too close

1343
02:19:56,254 --> 02:19:57,687
She refuses to understand.
You take care of her.

1344
02:20:01,259 --> 02:20:05,696
That slap on your face is
the slap on my prestige...

1345
02:20:05,797 --> 02:20:08,698
...for you have borne an
irresponsible daughter.

1346
02:20:09,768 --> 02:20:12,202
She is trying to add
fuel to the fire...

1347
02:20:12,303 --> 02:20:14,203
...that was started 27 years ago.

1348
02:20:14,305 --> 02:20:17,706
None but my enemy's son
you fall in love with?

1349
02:20:17,809 --> 02:20:19,709
Enemy's son? Ranjit?

1350
02:20:22,781 --> 02:20:26,217
This family will accept
only a Christian son-in-law.

1351
02:20:26,818 --> 02:20:29,753
Else, I cannot imagine, how many
will lie dead on either side.

1352
02:20:32,824 --> 02:20:36,225
Ranjit, this is etched in stone.

1353
02:20:36,361 --> 02:20:40,764
Only a Hindu girl may
enter this family.

1354
02:20:40,865 --> 02:20:46,269
That's my final decision. Not
even God can change my decision.

1355
02:20:47,839 --> 02:20:52,276
Whatever the uncles might say,
I will make sure they're married

1356
02:20:54,846 --> 02:20:56,780
- What happened?
- Florence has run away from home

1357
02:21:47,899 --> 02:21:49,332
Overtake that bus.

1358
02:21:57,408 --> 02:21:58,841
Drag them out.

1359
02:22:06,384 --> 02:22:08,318
They're driving me crazy.

1360
02:22:08,887 --> 02:22:11,321
They aren't in that bus.

1361
02:22:12,390 --> 02:22:13,823
The marriage registrar's office...

1362
02:22:20,899 --> 02:22:22,833
They aren't inside.

1363
02:22:23,902 --> 02:22:25,335
The railway station, hurry.

1364
02:22:41,953 --> 02:22:43,386
Any news?

1365
02:22:43,488 --> 02:22:45,888
We've combed the entire area.
Couldn't find them anywhere.

1366
02:22:45,990 --> 02:22:48,891
If my daughter isn't
home by nightfall...

1367
02:22:50,461 --> 02:22:54,397
...no one will be left
alive in their family.

1368
02:22:54,966 --> 02:22:57,901
This is Holy War!
He has tainted my prestige.

1369
02:22:58,002 --> 02:23:02,837
If I am disgraced, I will
burn everything to ashes.

1370
02:23:25,964 --> 02:23:30,401
Stop, please. Stop.

1371
02:23:31,970 --> 02:23:33,403
What are you about to do?

1372
02:23:33,504 --> 02:23:35,904
It's all happening because of you.

1373
02:23:37,976 --> 02:23:42,413
Where are you hiding them? Tell me!

1374
02:23:43,481 --> 02:23:46,416
Speak!
Or I'll bury you alive right here.

1375
02:23:47,018 --> 02:23:50,419
Where are they?
Talk or you're dead.

1376
02:24:01,966 --> 02:24:06,403
Florence and Ranjit never went
anywhere. They're right here.

1377
02:24:06,971 --> 02:24:10,907
They will never marry unless
they have your blessings.

1378
02:24:13,978 --> 02:24:16,913
You wanted a Christian
son-in-law, no?

1379
02:24:17,015 --> 02:24:19,916
Congratulations.
He is a Christian.

1380
02:24:20,051 --> 02:24:22,451
But your daughter is
Christian no more.

1381
02:24:38,036 --> 02:24:43,474
And you wanted a Hindu bride
for your son, didn't you?

1382
02:24:43,574 --> 02:24:47,476
She is Hindu.
But your son is Hindu no more.

1383
02:25:01,025 --> 02:25:03,459
Now your son-in-law
and daughter-in-law follow...

1384
02:25:03,561 --> 02:25:05,961
...the creeds of your choosing.

1385
02:25:06,064 --> 02:25:08,464
But your son and daughter
do not follow your credo.

1386
02:25:19,043 --> 02:25:22,979
Now what?
What will you do?

1387
02:25:23,081 --> 02:25:26,983
Who is warring against whom?
Which religion is at war?

1388
02:25:27,118 --> 02:25:28,517
And how to start the fires?

1389
02:25:29,087 --> 02:25:31,521
Because someone or the other
must be taught a lesson.

1390
02:25:31,622 --> 02:25:34,022
We can't allow anyone else to win.

1391
02:25:35,093 --> 02:25:38,028
Impossible!
Victory to our religion!

1392
02:25:38,129 --> 02:25:41,530
Victory to me!

1393
02:25:43,101 --> 02:25:50,030
Isn't that the secret behind the
crusades, the holy wars, jihads?

1394
02:25:51,109 --> 02:25:52,041
Selfish ends.

1395
02:25:53,111 --> 02:25:54,043
Egos.

1396
02:25:55,113 --> 02:25:56,546
Power. Victory.

1397
02:25:57,115 --> 02:26:01,984
The two of you should join hands
You used the quarrel to prove...

1398
02:26:02,120 --> 02:26:05,021
...that you swear by
the same creed...

1399
02:26:05,123 --> 02:26:07,523
...you speak the same language.
Of hatred.

1400
02:26:10,094 --> 02:26:14,531
Whereas religion can
mean nothing but love.

1401
02:26:17,101 --> 02:26:22,539
Do not tear the lovers apart.
Enough of this attrition.

1402
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:28,545
Enough of these killings.
Give life a chance.

1403
02:26:30,114 --> 02:26:33,049
Let them find happiness
for themselves.

1404
02:26:33,184 --> 02:26:37,086
For all you can set
apart are bodies.

1405
02:26:39,157 --> 02:26:42,558
Can anyone erase love from hearts?

1406
02:26:44,162 --> 02:26:46,096
No matter how much you plead...

1407
02:26:46,197 --> 02:26:48,597
...these crooked fellows
won't straighten out.

1408
02:26:51,169 --> 02:26:54,605
D'souza, give me your cross.

1409
02:26:55,173 --> 02:26:57,107
Give me your rosary.

1410
02:27:08,152 --> 02:27:11,553
From today, I'm Shivshanker.

1411
02:27:12,156 --> 02:27:14,590
And I'm Peter Pereira.

1412
02:27:16,160 --> 02:27:19,596
Jassi, when you were
born you didn't know...

1413
02:27:19,697 --> 02:27:22,598
...whether you were
Hindu or Christian.

1414
02:27:22,700 --> 02:27:26,602
I'm the one who told
you, you're Hindu.

1415
02:27:27,171 --> 02:27:30,106
Your father is Hindu,
your daughter is Hindu.

1416
02:27:30,208 --> 02:27:32,108
How can you be Christian?

1417
02:27:33,177 --> 02:27:37,113
27 years ago, we
behaved just like you...

1418
02:27:37,215 --> 02:27:40,116
...and we have suffered.

1419
02:27:40,251 --> 02:27:44,153
You mustn't suffer
like us all over again.

1420
02:27:46,224 --> 02:27:48,158
Give your consent to the marriage.

1421
02:27:49,227 --> 02:27:54,665
Your father is begging of you, son.
Give your consent.

1422
02:28:25,229 --> 02:28:27,663
"I have seen, I know"

1423
02:28:30,234 --> 02:28:33,169
"I know it, in my heart"

1424
02:28:34,238 --> 02:28:37,674
"In the victory of
two loving hearts..."

1425
02:28:39,243 --> 02:28:42,679
"I rejoice"

1426
02:29:05,736 --> 02:29:14,166
"If you got faith in your heart,
you got everything"

1427
02:29:15,246 --> 02:29:24,177
"If there's no faith,
you got nothing"

1428
02:29:25,289 --> 02:29:29,191
"Love... love... love...
go on sharing love"

1429
02:30:22,380 --> 02:30:27,818
Lucky, our roles are over.
Time to wipe off the make-up.

1430
02:30:27,952 --> 02:30:32,355
Return the dresses and find out
the timing of the bus back home.

1431
02:30:32,456 --> 02:30:33,855
In the meantime, I'll pack.

1432
02:30:44,435 --> 02:30:46,369
Can't even smile?

1433
02:30:59,450 --> 02:31:01,350
Actually, Raja isn't our son.

1434
02:31:05,423 --> 02:31:09,826
Yes Grandpa. Raja is a friend
of Florence and Ranjit.

1435
02:31:10,428 --> 02:31:13,363
He staged this melodrama
to help them get married.

1436
02:31:14,432 --> 02:31:15,865
Were it not for him...

1437
02:31:15,966 --> 02:31:17,866
...our families would never
have come together again.

1438
02:31:20,438 --> 02:31:25,375
- Will you come over here, please?
- I know what's on your mind.

1439
02:31:25,476 --> 02:31:28,377
Why don't we take
Raja for a grandson?

1440
02:31:29,447 --> 02:31:32,883
Let me announce this.
From this day...

1441
02:31:33,017 --> 02:31:36,418
...Raja is our grandson and
we are his grandparents!

1442
02:31:36,520 --> 02:31:37,452
Applause, please.

1443
02:31:37,555 --> 02:31:40,422
Chaddha, words don't
make a relative.

1444
02:31:40,524 --> 02:31:41,456
Then?

1445
02:31:41,559 --> 02:31:47,930
It will come to be once our
Tina is married to Raja.

1446
02:31:48,499 --> 02:31:52,435
First, you must ask Raja whether
he is willing to accept.

1447
02:31:53,003 --> 02:31:56,439
- I'll talk to Raja.
- Right, he's your friend.

1448
02:31:56,540 --> 02:32:00,874
- He will surely agree if you say.
- No Ghuman Uncle.

1449
02:32:01,445 --> 02:32:05,882
- I can't marry her.
- But why?

1450
02:32:06,984 --> 02:32:09,316
Raja, tell me.

1451
02:32:10,488 --> 02:32:11,420
For my sake.

1452
02:32:16,494 --> 02:32:18,928
Because I'm in love
with another girl.

1453
02:32:19,497 --> 02:32:23,934
You're in love with a girl
and I know nothing about it?

1454
02:32:24,034 --> 02:32:26,935
Raja, you turn out to
be quite a revelation.

1455
02:32:27,037 --> 02:32:29,437
Come on, quick.
Who's the lucky girl?

1456
02:32:30,508 --> 02:32:34,945
- Tell me. Raja, please...
- Florence, what use knowing?

1457
02:32:35,045 --> 02:32:37,946
I'll talk to Grandpa right away.
I'll see to it you marry her.

1458
02:32:38,048 --> 02:32:40,448
- That isn't possible.
- But why?

1459
02:32:40,584 --> 02:32:42,484
Because she's married.

1460
02:32:43,554 --> 02:32:47,957
Besides, she never loved me.
She was in love with someone else.

1461
02:32:48,092 --> 02:32:49,992
And now she's married to him.

1462
02:32:51,562 --> 02:32:53,996
She ditched you for someone else?

1463
02:32:55,566 --> 02:33:01,436
- Don't call her names.
- But what use pining for her?

1464
02:33:01,539 --> 02:33:04,440
Better, get married.
Start life anew.

1465
02:33:04,542 --> 02:33:06,442
Love just happens...

1466
02:33:06,544 --> 02:33:10,947
...without any consideration
for gains or betterment.

1467
02:33:11,515 --> 02:33:15,451
Love is so overwhelming
an emotion...

1468
02:33:15,586 --> 02:33:18,987
...it leaves space
for no one else.

1469
02:33:20,558 --> 02:33:25,996
- Is that your last word?
- No. It's my final decision.

1470
02:33:27,565 --> 02:33:32,502
Florence, I know my decision
is going to hurt you.

1471
02:33:32,603 --> 02:33:35,504
But I'm happy for myself.
Farewell.
