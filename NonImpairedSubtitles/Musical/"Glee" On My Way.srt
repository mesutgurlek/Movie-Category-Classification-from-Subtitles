1
00:00:00,712 --> 00:00:02,878
- Oh, this is good.
- Oh, this... look at this one.

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,269
Oh, it's so timeless.
It's perfect.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,488
Yeah, timeless, meaning you can wait
two or five years to wear it.

4
00:00:07,489 --> 00:00:08,805
Don't be jealous.

5
00:00:08,806 --> 00:00:10,102
Well, well, well.

6
00:00:10,103 --> 00:00:13,160
If it isn't a young Barbra Streisand
and an old Betty White.

7
00:00:13,161 --> 00:00:15,245
Where is Gay Cyclops?

8
00:00:15,246 --> 00:00:16,858
Still trying
to stumble his way in?

9
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,402
We can't come here anymore.

10
00:00:18,403 --> 00:00:21,668
Rachel, I, uh, brought
an engagement gift for you.

11
00:00:21,669 --> 00:00:22,864
Hmm.

12
00:00:25,575 --> 00:00:27,577
Whoa. Oh, whoa, whoa!
Oh, my God!

13
00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:29,259
Oh, no, that is...
that is Photoshopped.

14
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,540
His thing is not that small
or... or brown.

15
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,291
And he could never fit
into those pumps.

16
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:35,085
Just think, from
now until eternity,

17
00:00:35,086 --> 00:00:37,935
every time someone
Googles Finn Hudson,

18
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:41,385
they'll be treated to that
and dozens just like it.

19
00:00:41,386 --> 00:00:44,011
That's the beauty of the Internet.
It stays with us forever.

20
00:00:44,012 --> 00:00:45,679
What do you want, Sebastian?

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,598
I want a guaranteed Regionals win,
so I want you to drop out.

22
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:50,809
McKinley gets home-court
advantage this year.

23
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,534
You're going to come
down with Asian bird flu

24
00:00:53,535 --> 00:00:55,397
or whatever Tina
Blowing-Wang just had.

25
00:00:55,398 --> 00:00:57,149
But that is show choir
terrorism.

26
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,110
You give a bad name
to the entire gay community.

27
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:02,192
And you give the gay community
cutting-edge fashion

28
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:04,912
that's usually only seen
on Puerto Rican pride floats.

29
00:01:04,913 --> 00:01:06,575
I'm sorry... I didn't hear you.

30
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:08,702
I was distracted
by your giant horse teeth.

31
00:01:08,703 --> 00:01:10,746
You have 24 hours
to drop out, Rachel,

32
00:01:10,747 --> 00:01:12,886
or I press the
upload button.

33
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:20,511
That's it. I'm done.
I'm leaving this classroom,

34
00:01:20,512 --> 00:01:22,215
and I'm going to beat
that Sebastian kid's ass!

35
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:24,148
- Finn, chill.
- No, I'm not going to chill.

36
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:25,969
- I... I'm done chilling.
- The official show choir rule book

37
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,388
states that "any real
or perceived threat of violence,

38
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:30,474
"vandalism or humiliation
will be met with a swift

39
00:01:30,475 --> 00:01:32,156
"and unquestioned
disqualification

40
00:01:32,157 --> 00:01:33,690
of the threatening party's team
with extreme prejudice."

41
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:34,728
It's right here.

42
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:37,981
Page 72, by-law 15,
section six, article 44.

43
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:39,896
Guys, I contacted
the headmaster of Dalton.

44
00:01:39,897 --> 00:01:40,984
Like you did when Sebastian

45
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:43,195
almost blinded me?
What did they do then?

46
00:01:43,196 --> 00:01:44,821
Same thing as they're
going to do now... nothing.

47
00:01:44,822 --> 00:01:46,420
Look, none of this
matters now anyways, okay?

48
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:48,205
We're not going to let him
beat us like this.

49
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:50,757
- I'm going to perform at Regionals.
- Even if he's going to post

50
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:52,704
a photo like this
of me if you do?

51
00:01:52,705 --> 00:01:54,289
Finn, I'm not going to negotiate
with terrorists.

52
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,916
If someone posted a picture

53
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:59,216
like that of me online,
I'd probably kill myself.

54
00:01:59,217 --> 00:02:00,587
Twice to be sure
I was dead.

55
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:03,136
Look, you guys are just going to have
to deal with things like this.

56
00:02:03,137 --> 00:02:05,467
The more successful you get,
the more garbage

57
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:06,718
people are going to
make up about you.

58
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,192
They're going to love
to tear you down.

59
00:02:08,193 --> 00:02:09,471
I can't believe
you would do that to me.

60
00:02:09,472 --> 00:02:11,478
I'm going to be
married to you.

61
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,266
Don't you think I'm going to
suffer the consequences as well?

62
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:15,685
I mean, I just... I don't care
about stuff like that.

63
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:17,868
I love you, and we'll...
we'll manage this together.

64
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:20,273
Okay, the important thing
right now is that we win.

65
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:21,955
So you wouldn't care
if I Photoshopped a photo

66
00:02:21,956 --> 00:02:23,443
of you like this
and put it on the Internet?

67
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:25,792
Look, our future depends
on us winning Regionals.

68
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:28,031
It'll help me
towards my NYADA application.

69
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:29,213
Hmm.

70
00:02:29,214 --> 00:02:30,367
Hope you get in.

71
00:02:30,368 --> 00:02:31,701
Finn.

72
00:02:36,588 --> 00:02:39,751
- You wanted to see me?
- Q, have a seat.

73
00:02:39,752 --> 00:02:42,087
Prepare yourself.

74
00:02:42,088 --> 00:02:44,678
I'm about to drop a bomb on you.

75
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:51,602
I, Sue Sylvester...

76
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:53,770
am with child.

77
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,143
Are you serious?

78
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,147
Wow.

79
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:04,693
Um, that's amazing
and confusing.

80
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,446
- Who's the father?
- Oh, I can't tell you that yet.

81
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:11,588
But here's the deal.
In order for this zygote

82
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:13,674
to stay firmly ensconced
in my uterine wall,

83
00:03:13,675 --> 00:03:15,745
my doctor has put me
on bovine hormones

84
00:03:15,746 --> 00:03:18,164
that are making me
extremely nauseous.

85
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,709
They've also given me a
near-superhuman sense of smell.

86
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,266
For instance,
I can tell

87
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:23,767
that within the last week,
you either enjoyed

88
00:03:23,768 --> 00:03:25,636
a delicious curry
or a hug from Principal Figgins.

89
00:03:25,637 --> 00:03:29,222
Well, you know,
morning sickness is a good sign.

90
00:03:29,223 --> 00:03:31,720
It means that the baby
is developing properly.

91
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:34,097
Well, it's good for the baby,
not so good for me.

92
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:37,809
Well, you know, there really
is no cure for morning sickness.

93
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,400
I mean, I ate saltines,

94
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:43,440
drank herbal tea
and sucked on lollipops.

95
00:03:43,441 --> 00:03:44,955
That helps.

96
00:03:44,956 --> 00:03:46,943
Lollipops?
Yeah.

97
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:50,460
Weird, but it works.

98
00:03:50,461 --> 00:03:52,162
Well, thank you, Q,

99
00:03:52,163 --> 00:03:54,464
for that condescending tone
and barely helpful advice.

100
00:03:58,136 --> 00:04:00,921
I wanted to ask you a favor,
actually, Coach.

101
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,668
I would love
to rejoin the Cheerios!

102
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:05,676
I beg your pardon?
It's my senior year,

103
00:04:05,677 --> 00:04:07,210
and I want to finish high school

104
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:08,673
in a Cheerios! uniform
with a national championship.

105
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:10,759
I mean,
other than Glee,

106
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,886
this was the rest
of my high school experience.

107
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:16,403
Well, I'm sorry, Q,
but that wouldn't be fair

108
00:04:16,404 --> 00:04:19,434
to the girls who've been practicing
all year long, who didn't quit.

109
00:04:19,435 --> 00:04:22,909
And if you'll now please
get the hell out of my office.

110
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,661
I just caught a whiff
of hot dog water

111
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:26,563
wafting in from the cafeteria,

112
00:04:26,564 --> 00:04:29,194
and I think I'm going to blow
some serious chunks.

113
00:04:29,195 --> 00:04:31,118
Excuse me.

114
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:40,877
You okay?
You seemed upset.

115
00:04:42,123 --> 00:04:44,584
- And if Sebastian thinks...
- Forget about Sebastian!

116
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,717
I'm not mad at
you. I just...

117
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:48,802
don't want to waste
any more time on him.

118
00:04:48,803 --> 00:04:51,254
I-I want to focus on winning.

119
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:54,424
I've got a new song
I want to try out.

120
00:04:54,425 --> 00:04:55,776
The theme for Regionals
is "Inspiration,"

121
00:04:55,777 --> 00:04:57,973
and I think this fits the bill.
You want to hear it?

122
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:08,984
Hey, Karofsky.

123
00:05:08,985 --> 00:05:10,941
What's up, Nick?

124
00:05:36,093 --> 00:05:39,014
â™ª Life's too short
to even care at all â™ª

125
00:05:39,015 --> 00:05:40,193
â™ª Whoa â™ª

126
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:41,433
That's terrible.

127
00:05:43,397 --> 00:05:45,915
â™ª I'm losing my mind,
losing my mind â™ª

128
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:49,669
â™ª Losing control â™ª

129
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,985
- You want to go? Huh?
- â™ª These fishes in the sea â™ª

130
00:05:51,986 --> 00:05:54,779
- â™ª They're staring at me, whoa â™ª
- Homo.

131
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,991
â™ª Whoa â™ª

132
00:05:57,992 --> 00:06:00,744
â™ª Wet world aches
for a beat of a drum â™ª

133
00:06:00,745 --> 00:06:03,249
â™ª Whoa, whoa â™ª

134
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:08,585
â™ª If I could find a way
to see this straight â™ª

135
00:06:08,586 --> 00:06:10,573
â™ª I'd run away â™ª

136
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:13,840
â™ª To some fortune that I â™ª

137
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:19,315
â™ª Should have found by now â™ª

138
00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:23,516
â™ª I'm waiting
for this cough syrup â™ª

139
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:27,812
â™ª To come down â™ª
â™ª Come down â™ª

140
00:06:42,993 --> 00:06:46,498
â™ª Life's too short
to even care at all â™ª

141
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:47,894
â™ª Whoa â™ª

142
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:53,016
â™ª I'm coming up now,
coming up now â™ª

143
00:06:53,017 --> 00:06:54,589
â™ª Out of the blue â™ª

144
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,674
â™ª Oh â™ª

145
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:59,761
â™ª These zombies in the park â™ª

146
00:06:59,762 --> 00:07:01,407
â™ª They're looking
for my heart â™ª

147
00:07:01,408 --> 00:07:04,099
â™ª Whoa, whoa â™ª

148
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,811
â™ª A dark world aches
for a splash of the sun â™ª

149
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:11,189
â™ª Whoa, whoa â™ª

150
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,151
â™ª If I could find a way
to see this straight â™ª

151
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:17,362
â™ª I'd run away â™ª

152
00:07:17,363 --> 00:07:20,115
â™ª To some fortune that I â™ª

153
00:07:20,116 --> 00:07:24,786
â™ª Should have found by now â™ª

154
00:07:24,787 --> 00:07:29,352
â™ª And so I run now to the things
they said could restore me â™ª

155
00:07:29,353 --> 00:07:33,139
â™ª Restore life
the way it should be â™ª

156
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,298
â™ª I'm waiting
for this cough syrup â™ª

157
00:07:37,299 --> 00:07:42,804
â™ª To come down â™ª

158
00:07:42,805 --> 00:07:45,618
â™ª One more spoon
of cough syrup now â™ª

159
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:47,403
â™ª Whoa â™ª

160
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,858
â™ª One more spoon
of cough syrup now â™ª

161
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:55,078
â™ª Whoa â™ª

162
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,318
â™ª Oh. â™ª

163
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:06,494
We have to be
very careful about how

164
00:08:06,495 --> 00:08:08,496
we deliver the news of this
to the student body.

165
00:08:08,497 --> 00:08:10,066
David was part
of this community,

166
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:12,208
and he still has
many friends here.

167
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:15,795
And my understanding
is that these teen suicides...

168
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:20,175
or even attempts like David's...
can induce a string of copycats.

169
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:21,342
It's just so senseless.

170
00:08:21,343 --> 00:08:23,303
Facebook,
Twitter, Tumblr.

171
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:25,096
The pressure to protect
your reputation

172
00:08:25,097 --> 00:08:26,639
is so much worse
than when we were kids.

173
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,267
Yeah, and these people
can sling their hatred

174
00:08:29,268 --> 00:08:30,477
and their mud
anonymously.

175
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:33,640
Sue, are you crying?

176
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:37,734
- Hormones.
- No, it's not hormones.

177
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,764
I could have done more.

178
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:43,198
I was principal when Dave
was having his trouble

179
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:44,949
with Porcelain, and...

180
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,404
I knew there was something
up with that kid. I knew it.

181
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:51,748
All I can think of
is his dad finding him.

182
00:08:51,749 --> 00:08:54,494
Get some help! David, no!
Buddy, come on.

183
00:08:54,495 --> 00:08:55,919
David!

184
00:08:57,332 --> 00:08:59,339
And that feeling.

185
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,301
Guys, we were all hard on Dave.

186
00:09:01,302 --> 00:09:03,551
We thought he
was going to hurt Kurt.

187
00:09:03,552 --> 00:09:06,971
I just never thought
he'd hurt himself.

188
00:09:06,972 --> 00:09:10,266
- It wasn't our job to know.
- Then whose job was it?

189
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:15,315
We should start today's meeting

190
00:09:15,316 --> 00:09:17,565
by praying for Karofsky.

191
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:20,485
That he finds peace and
that he feels better.

192
00:09:20,486 --> 00:09:22,028
I think we should
start today's meeting

193
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,279
by praying for his family.

194
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,615
They could use comfort
more than he could.

195
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:26,950
I just don't understand how

196
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:29,160
he could get to such
a horrible, dark place.

197
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:30,411
It's all over Facebook.

198
00:09:30,412 --> 00:09:33,867
A couple of kids from
Karofsky's new school

199
00:09:33,868 --> 00:09:36,626
saw him at Breadstix with
Kurt on Valentine's Day.

200
00:09:36,627 --> 00:09:38,503
They posted mean
stuff on his page

201
00:09:38,504 --> 00:09:40,290
and texted everyone
that he was gay.

202
00:09:41,492 --> 00:09:44,259
- He couldn't take it.
- How is he?

203
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,496
- Is he going to live?
- Well, he's in the hospital,

204
00:09:46,497 --> 00:09:48,471
but thank God his dad
found him in time.

205
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:50,932
I feel sorry for Karofsky,

206
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:53,393
but what he did
was selfish.

207
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:55,395
He didn't just want to hurt
himself; he wanted to hurt

208
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:56,604
everyone around him.

209
00:09:56,605 --> 00:09:59,009
I went through the wringer,
but I never

210
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,566
- got to that place.
- Quinn, please.

211
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:03,447
Sure, you had a baby
when you were 16

212
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:06,072
and you had a bad dye job
for two weeks,

213
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:08,950
but seriously? The world never
stopped loving you.

214
00:10:08,951 --> 00:10:10,994
And you're
going to Yale.

215
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:13,037
You have no idea what Karofsky
was struggling with.

216
00:10:13,038 --> 00:10:15,039
You really want to try
to compare...

217
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,500
The despair, the
self-loathing.

218
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:18,918
It doesn't matter.

219
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,548
I just can't imagine things
getting so messed-up

220
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:23,631
that you would consider
taking your own life.

221
00:10:23,632 --> 00:10:26,136
That is so harsh and reductive.

222
00:10:26,137 --> 00:10:27,552
Have some compassion.

223
00:10:27,553 --> 00:10:30,179
Do you know what they're still
writing on his Facebook?

224
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,765
"Better luck next time"
and "Try, try again."

225
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:33,933
Why are you even
here, Kurt?

226
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,762
Thought you didn't
believe in God.

227
00:10:37,682 --> 00:10:40,231
He asked me if he could come,
and I invited him.

228
00:10:40,232 --> 00:10:45,155
I heard you guys were praying
for Karofsky, and...

229
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:47,223
after everything
that we've been through,

230
00:10:47,224 --> 00:10:49,392
I didn't have
anywhere else to go.

231
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:57,868
I feel responsible.

232
00:10:59,921 --> 00:11:03,757
He asked me out, and...

233
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:05,048
I said no.

234
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,052
And he kept calling me...

235
00:11:12,262 --> 00:11:14,807
<i>If I'd just answered one
of those stupid calls...</i>

236
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:21,147
We're taking a edible
arrangement to the hospital.

237
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,528
Do you want to come with us?

238
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:32,825
I'm so sorry.

239
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,938
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

240
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:40,124
Look, I've been thinking
about what Dave did,

241
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,918
and I just want you to know
that there's nothing

242
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,499
that anybody could do and there's
nothing that anybody could say about me

243
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,173
that would make me
want to do that.

244
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,753
Good, 'cause I don't ever want
to be without you.

245
00:11:51,593 --> 00:11:54,931
So, I'm not gonna
perform at Regionals.

246
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:57,511
You have to. Look, I don't care
about these pictures.

247
00:11:57,512 --> 00:11:59,312
I don't care about what anybody
says about me...

248
00:11:59,313 --> 00:12:00,463
except for you.

249
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:09,987
Life's too short.

250
00:12:09,988 --> 00:12:11,906
- What?
- Look, I don't want to wait

251
00:12:11,907 --> 00:12:14,411
for some arbitrary date
to start living it, I...

252
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:16,863
I want to get married.

253
00:12:16,864 --> 00:12:18,121
Now.

254
00:12:18,122 --> 00:12:19,622
I have gym.
No, it's Saturday.

255
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:22,041
After we win Regionals.

256
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,584
Seriously?

257
00:12:23,585 --> 00:12:25,294
Yeah.
Awesome!

258
00:12:27,324 --> 00:12:28,756
But wait, what...

259
00:12:28,757 --> 00:12:30,127
what if we lose?

260
00:12:30,128 --> 00:12:32,295
Well, I thought we agreed
that I was singing.

261
00:12:40,638 --> 00:12:44,605
Let me break it down for you,
from one bitch to another.

262
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:46,107
All this vicious,
underhanded crap

263
00:12:46,108 --> 00:12:47,900
has got to stop.
Exactly.

264
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,110
That's why
I called you here.

265
00:12:49,111 --> 00:12:50,697
First of all...

266
00:12:50,698 --> 00:12:52,649
Blaine,
I am sorry about your eye.

267
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,656
That means
nothing to me.

268
00:12:53,657 --> 00:12:55,908
Just give me a chance.
I have no excuses,

269
00:12:55,909 --> 00:13:00,371
other than a lame prank got
completely out of control.

270
00:13:00,372 --> 00:13:02,790
Second, the Finn photos have
all been destroyed.

271
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,084
I want the Warblers
to win fair and square.

272
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:07,030
And we're gonna take donations

273
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:08,504
for Lady Gaga's Born This Way
Foundation.

274
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:10,083
Win, lose or draw,

275
00:13:10,084 --> 00:13:13,092
we're gonna dedicate our
performance to Dave Karofsky.

276
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,678
I thought you might
want to join us.

277
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,847
Wait for the punch,
you know it's coming.

278
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:19,926
No, not this time.

279
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:25,855
For too long I have treated
everything like a big joke.

280
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:28,735
So, how do you get
a guy to like you?

281
00:13:28,736 --> 00:13:31,404
You, get a guy? Please.

282
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:34,057
Why, what's wrong with me?

283
00:13:34,058 --> 00:13:36,824
First off, you're about
100 pounds overweight.

284
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:40,244
Quit waxing your eyebrows.
You look like Liberace.

285
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:43,915
In fact, just stay in
the closet, buddy.

286
00:13:46,037 --> 00:13:48,255
It's all fun and games...

287
00:13:48,256 --> 00:13:49,295
until it's not.

288
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:55,468
Mr. Shue, why do you have a jar
of peanut butter with one spoon?

289
00:13:55,469 --> 00:13:56,886
Yeah, there are 15 of us here,

290
00:13:56,887 --> 00:13:58,748
and I'm only comfortable

291
00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:01,098
sharing a spoon
with about half of you.

292
00:14:01,099 --> 00:14:02,519
Well, it's come to my attention

293
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,685
that our good friend Rory Flanagan
has never tasted peanut butter.

294
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:06,979
- What?!
- Are you serious?

295
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,189
- No way.
- It's not possible.

296
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,926
Rory, if you don't mind.

297
00:14:13,114 --> 00:14:14,597
Oh, God...

298
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:20,070
Oh, my God...

299
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:21,452
That's the best thing
I've ever had.

300
00:14:22,704 --> 00:14:28,584
Mr. Shuester, wow, that's
incredibly moving,

301
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:30,294
Yeah, Mr. Shue,
what's the point of all this?

302
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:32,004
The point is

303
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,416
Rory just had
a brand-new experience,

304
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:35,091
something as simple
as peanut butter.

305
00:14:35,092 --> 00:14:36,259
You guys are young.

306
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,172
I want you to promise me

307
00:14:39,173 --> 00:14:41,430
that, no matter
how depressed you get,

308
00:14:41,431 --> 00:14:44,811
no matter how hopeless or alone
you feel,

309
00:14:44,812 --> 00:14:49,099
you'll try your best to imagine
all of the amazing experiences

310
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,398
you have ahead of you.

311
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,968
Mr. Shue, look,
I know we're

312
00:14:51,969 --> 00:14:55,778
a little dramatic sometimes,
but I don't think

313
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:58,114
anyone will ever consider taking
their own life.

314
00:14:58,115 --> 00:15:00,777
I did.

315
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,744
Junior year.

316
00:15:03,745 --> 00:15:06,866
That was a tough year.

317
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:09,166
I, uh, I cheated on
my math midterm.

318
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:11,821
Peeked at the answers
of the guy next to me and...

319
00:15:11,822 --> 00:15:13,796
the teacher saw me do it.

320
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:15,125
Just 'cause you got caught
cheating?

321
00:15:15,126 --> 00:15:16,632
I get caught cheating
all the time.

322
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:20,930
They called my dad
at his office,

323
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:23,366
and he was coming
to pick me up.

324
00:15:24,602 --> 00:15:26,601
How was I supposed
to look him in the eye?

325
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:32,565
I just kept...
cturing my dad

326
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:36,746
so disappointed in me.

327
00:15:38,515 --> 00:15:41,368
So... I walked up to the roof.

328
00:15:43,283 --> 00:15:44,537
I went right to the edge.

329
00:15:47,287 --> 00:15:50,794
One step and all the pain and
humiliation would be over.

330
00:15:52,876 --> 00:15:54,045
Is that true?

331
00:15:54,046 --> 00:15:57,500
That day, I promise you,

332
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:59,425
it felt like it was
the end of the world.

333
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:02,470
But you know what?

334
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:04,597
It wasn't.

335
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:07,977
You know, for some of you,
getting caught cheating

336
00:16:07,978 --> 00:16:09,312
isn't a big deal.

337
00:16:09,313 --> 00:16:14,517
But there's something...

338
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:17,737
everyone has something

339
00:16:17,738 --> 00:16:20,446
that might take them up
to that edge.

340
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:23,726
And look at all the things
I would've missed out on.

341
00:16:23,727 --> 00:16:26,229
I would've never met you guys
or Emma.

342
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,955
I would've missed out
on everything.

343
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:34,293
So, right now, I want you all
to think of something that

344
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,711
you're looking
forward to.

345
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:38,172
Big things.

346
00:16:38,173 --> 00:16:39,674
Someday, I want to earn

347
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:41,258
enough money to buy
my folks a new place,

348
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:42,512
so they don't ever
have to go through

349
00:16:42,513 --> 00:16:43,719
losing their home again.

350
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,887
I'm most looking forward

351
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:46,889
to meeting Rachel
Berry's children.

352
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:51,978
I want to be there to see
my kid's first steps.

353
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:54,021
I want to be there to see
<i>Sex and the City Part III.</i>

354
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:56,190
Wow.

355
00:16:56,191 --> 00:16:57,760
I'm sort of
embarrassed to admit it,

356
00:16:57,761 --> 00:16:59,485
but I really do want
to graduate high school.

357
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,696
I'm gonna petition
the Army to change

358
00:17:01,697 --> 00:17:04,407
my dad's dishonorable discharge
status to an honorable one.

359
00:17:04,408 --> 00:17:05,618
I'm looking forward
to graduating

360
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,159
from Yale
at the top of my class.

361
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,037
I'm looking forward to the day
when my grandmother loves me again.

362
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:12,123
I want Lord Tubbington to kick
his Ecstasy addiction.

363
00:17:12,124 --> 00:17:15,668
I am looking forward to marriage
equality in all 50 states.

364
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:18,254
I'm looking forward to the first
time I dance at Carnegie Hall.

365
00:17:18,255 --> 00:17:19,505
I just want a song.

366
00:17:21,216 --> 00:17:23,753
I'm looking forward to
watching my dad make

367
00:17:23,754 --> 00:17:25,052
a difference in Congress.

368
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:26,679
I'm looking forward to being
friends with all of you

369
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,723
for the rest of my life.

370
00:17:28,724 --> 00:17:30,293
I know this sounds silly,

371
00:17:30,294 --> 00:17:31,561
and the peanut butter really
is amazing, Mr. Shue,

372
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:32,768
but do you know what
I'm looking forward to?

373
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:35,062
Winning at Regionals.

374
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:42,445
And now,
let's meet our judges

375
00:17:42,446 --> 00:17:44,155
for the 2012 Midwest Regionals!

376
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:47,067
Deputy Zoning Commissioner
Melba Jackson-Wright!

377
00:17:47,068 --> 00:17:50,161
President of the Ohio Plumbers
Union Local 109,

378
00:17:50,162 --> 00:17:52,205
Mr. Harl Beindorf!

379
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:54,524
And Central Ohio's number one
late-night horror movie host...

380
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:56,692
- No...
- Svengoobles!

381
00:18:03,423 --> 00:18:06,135
And now, from Westerville, Ohio,
the Dalton Academy Warblers!

382
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:12,542
â™ª Come on and stand â™ª
â™ª <i>Come on, stand</i> â™ª

383
00:18:12,543 --> 00:18:16,395
â™ª Up again â™ª
â™ª <i>Why don't you stand?</i> â™ª

384
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,442
â™ª Stand,
you're gonna run again â™ª

385
00:18:21,718 --> 00:18:24,528
â™ª Don't give up,
you're gonna see tomorrow â™ª

386
00:18:24,822 --> 00:18:27,607
â™ª That you'll be on
your feet again â™ª

387
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:33,037
â™ª Sometimes the world's gonna
knock you over â™ª

388
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:35,998
â™ª But you will see
who are your friends â™ª

389
00:18:36,873 --> 00:18:39,752
â™ª Come on and stand â™ª
â™ª <i>Come on, stand</i> â™ª

390
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:44,048

00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:47,802
â™ª Come on and stand â™ª

00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,473
â™ª Stand,
you're gonna run again â™ª

393
00:18:52,749 --> 00:18:57,103
â™ª You have the power
to face your demons â™ª

394
00:18:57,104 --> 00:18:59,647
â™ª No matter how
they go on time â™ª

395
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:03,560
Why are you cheering
your competition?

396
00:19:03,561 --> 00:19:04,927
Life's too short.

397
00:19:04,928 --> 00:19:06,062
You should try it.

398
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:07,730
Come on.

399
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:08,656
Get up!

400
00:19:08,657 --> 00:19:10,733
â™ª Come on, stand â™ª

401

â™ª Come on, stand â™ª

405

â™ª You can make it â™ª

00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:25,832
â™ª Come on, stand,
you're gonna run again â™ª

407
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,843
â™ª Pick up your will
and put on your face â™ª

408
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,006
â™ª If you need to,
just take my hand â™ª

409
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:36,643
â™ª It's time to demonstrate,
don't hesitate â™ª

410
00:19:36,644 --> 00:19:41,897
â™ª Just get up and say,
"Yes, I can" â™ª

411
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,900
â™ª <i>You just stand</i> â™ª

â™ª Come on, stand
you're gonna run again. â™ª

416
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,503
Thank you.

417
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:05,371
Just a reminder
to please make a donation

418
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,373
to one of our charity baskets.

419
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,125
We're set up all around
the auditorium.

420
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:10,826
Just look for the Dalton blazer.

421
00:20:10,827 --> 00:20:13,296
Please... give what you can.

422
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:16,299
â™ª Ooh... â™ª

423
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,101
â™ª The sun goes down,
the stars come out â™ª

â™ª And all that counts
is here and now â™ª

425
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:28,235
â™ª My universe
will never be the same â™ª

â™ª I'm glad you came... â™ª

â™ª Da-da-da, la, la-la â™ª

434
00:20:48,423 --> 00:20:50,507
â™ª You cast a spell on me,
spell on me â™ª

435
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:54,504
â™ª You hit me like the sky
fell on me, fell on me â™ª

436
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:58,098
â™ª And I decided you look
well on me, well on me â™ª

437
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:01,094
â™ª So let's go somewhere
no one else can see â™ª

438
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:02,102
â™ª You and me â™ª

439

â™ª Turn the lights out now â™ª

440
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:06,516
â™ª Now I'll take you
by the hand â™ª

441
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:10,277
â™ª Hand you another drink,
drink it if you can â™ª

442
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:12,571
â™ª Can you spend a little time? â™ª

443
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,024
â™ª Time is slipping away,
away from us â™ª

444
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:19,536
â™ª So stay, stay with me I can
make, make you glad you came â™ª

445
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,540
â™ª The sun goes down,
the stars come out â™ª

00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:26,585
â™ª And all that counts
is here and now â™ª

00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,923
â™ª My universe will never be
the same â™ª

00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:34,627
â™ª I'm glad you came,
I'm glad you came â™ª

449
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:38,305
â™ª Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh â™ª

450
00:21:38,306 --> 00:21:39,848
â™ª Oh-oh-oh â™ª

451
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:41,558
â™ª Turn the lights out now â™ª

452
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:44,687
â™ª Now I'll take you
by the hand â™ª

453
00:21:44,688 --> 00:21:46,255
â™ª And you will never drink â™ª

454
00:21:46,256 --> 00:21:48,257
â™ª Drink â™ª
â™ª Drink it if you can â™ª

455
00:21:48,258 --> 00:21:49,984
â™ª Can â™ª
â™ª Spend a little time â™ª

456
00:21:49,985 --> 00:21:52,111
â™ª Time is slipping away â™ª

457
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:55,698
â™ª Away from us, so stay â™ª
â™ª Stay with me, I can make â™ª

458
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:57,199

â™ª The sunoes down â™ª

460
00:21:59,787 --> 00:22:01,996
â™ª The stars come out â™ª

461
00:22:01,997 --> 00:22:03,323
â™ª And all that counts â™ª

462
00:22:03,324 --> 00:22:04,957
â™ª Is here and now â™ª

463
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,542
â™ª My universe â™ª

464
00:22:06,543 --> 00:22:08,836
â™ª Will never be the same â™ª

465
00:22:08,837 --> 00:22:10,946
â™ª I'm glad you came â™ª

466
00:22:10,947 --> 00:22:12,881
â™ª I'm glad you came... â™ª

467
00:22:12,882 --> 00:22:14,717
â™ª <i>Whoa-oa-oa...</i> â™ª

00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:20,640
â™ª I'm glad you came â™ª

471
00:22:20,641 --> 00:22:22,291
â™ª <i>Whoa-oa-a â™ª</i>

â™ª Oh, oh, oh â™ª

474
00:22:27,022 --> 00:22:29,815
â™ª The sun goes down â™ª

475
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:31,967

00:22:35,773 --> 00:22:38,032
â™ª My universe â™ª

â™ª I'm glad you came. â™ª

482
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:57,301
And now, from Our Lady
of Perpetual Sorrow High School,

483
00:22:57,795 --> 00:22:59,862
the Golden Goblets!

484
00:22:59,863 --> 00:23:03,549
â™ª Where thoughts â™ª

485
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:09,549
â™ª Serenely sweet express â™ª

486
00:23:11,648 --> 00:23:15,819
â™ª She walks in beauty... â™ª

487
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,405
â™ª <i>Beauty...</i> â™ª

488
00:23:18,406 --> 00:23:20,516
Those Golden Goblet madrigal
singers were way better

489
00:23:20,517 --> 00:23:22,068
than I thought they'd be.

490
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:23,519
Are you high? I couldn't hear
their instruments at all.

491
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,787
All right, guys, listen up.

492
00:23:24,788 --> 00:23:26,322
Don't let them get
into your heads, okay?

493
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:27,957
Stay focused on what we do best.

494
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,525
Show circle time,
come on, let's huddle up!

495
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:34,129
Okay, uh...

496
00:23:34,415 --> 00:23:35,923
- Oh, Finn, you wanted to start us off?
- Yeah.

497
00:23:35,924 --> 00:23:37,508
I know it's kind of
short notice, but...

498
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:40,002
after the competition,

499
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:41,845
Rachel and I are going
to get married.

500
00:23:41,846 --> 00:23:43,806
At the Justice of the Peace,
at the Lima Municipal Center.

501
00:23:43,807 --> 00:23:45,591
There will be some light
refreshments afterwards,

502
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:46,893
My dads and I were

503
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:48,018
rolling finger sandwiches
all night long.

504
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:50,596
With everything
that's happened lately,

505
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:53,023
we thought a lot about
what Mr. Shue said.

506
00:23:53,024 --> 00:23:55,067
We didn't want
to wait anymore.

507
00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:58,320
We just want to live
every day like it's our last.

508
00:23:58,321 --> 00:24:00,440
So we wanted to thank a lot of
you guys that were supportive

509
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:02,574
of our decision to get married.
And-and for those of you

510
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:04,894
who maybe weren't the biggest
fans of our impending nuptials,

511
00:24:04,895 --> 00:24:06,299
we thank you also.

512
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,081
So after we win,
we would really love it

513
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:11,291
if all of you would
come to our wedding.

514
00:24:13,336 --> 00:24:14,503
Come on, bring it in!

515
00:24:14,504 --> 00:24:17,089
A... mazing!

516
00:24:19,116 --> 00:24:22,136
â™ª I came to win â™ª

517
00:24:22,137 --> 00:24:23,762
â™ª To fight â™ª

518
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:25,722
â™ª To conquer â™ª

519
00:24:25,723 --> 00:24:27,049
â™ª To thrive â™ª

520
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,835
â™ª I came to win â™ª

521
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,837
â™ª To survive â™ª

522
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:33,522
â™ª To prosper â™ª

523
00:24:33,523 --> 00:24:35,774
â™ª To rise â™ª

524
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:41,630
â™ª To fly... â™ª

525
00:24:43,906 --> 00:24:47,936
â™ª To fly... â™ª

526
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,498
â™ª Uh... Yo... Yo... â™ª

527
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:55,043
â™ª I used to think
that I could not â™ª

528
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:57,813
â™ª Go on... â™ª
â™ª I wish today, it would rain all day â™ª

529
00:24:57,814 --> 00:25:00,007
â™ª Maybe that would kind of
make the pain go away â™ª

530
00:25:00,008 --> 00:25:03,635
â™ª And life was nothing
but an awful song... â™ª

531
00:25:03,636 --> 00:25:05,179
â™ª They got they guns out,
aimin' at me â™ª

532
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,556
â™ª But I become near
when they aimin' at me â™ª

533
00:25:07,557 --> 00:25:09,516
â™ª Me, me, me against them â™ª

534
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:11,560
â™ª Me against enemies,
me against friends â™ª

535
00:25:11,561 --> 00:25:13,562
â™ª Somehow they both
seem to become one â™ª

536
00:25:13,563 --> 00:25:15,355
â™ª A sea full of sharks,
and they all smell blood â™ª

537
00:25:15,356 --> 00:25:17,516
â™ª They start coming
and I start rising â™ª

538
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:19,318
â™ª Must be surprising,
I'm just surmising â™ª

539
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:21,278
â™ª I win, thrive, soar, higher â™ª

540
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,363
â™ª Higher, higher, more fire â™ª

â™ª Was just my beginning â™ª

608
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:31,051
â™ª In the end... â™ª

609
00:28:31,052 --> 00:28:34,046
â™ª What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger â™ª

610
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:35,972
â™ª Stand a little taller â™ª

611
00:28:35,973 --> 00:28:39,184
â™ª Doesn't mean I'm lonely
when I'm alone â™ª

612
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,770
â™ª What doesn't kill you
makes a fighter â™ª

613
00:28:41,771 --> 00:28:43,522
â™ª Footsteps even lighter â™ª

614
00:28:44,146 --> 00:28:46,258
â™ª Doesn't mean I'm over â™ª

615
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:48,393
â™ª 'Cause you're gone â™ª

616
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:49,728
â™ª What doesn't kill you
makes you... â™ª

617
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:52,864
â™ª Stronger, stronger â™ª

618
00:28:53,573 --> 00:28:56,410
â™ª Just me, myself, and I â™ª

619
00:28:56,411 --> 00:28:58,036
â™ª What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger â™ª

620
00:28:58,037 --> 00:29:00,889
â™ª Stronger â™ª
â™ª Stand a little taller â™ª

621
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,708
â™ª Stronger â™ª
â™ª Doesn't mean I'm lonely â™ª

622
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:05,360
â™ª When I'm alone â™ª

623
00:29:05,361 --> 00:29:07,228
â™ª Not alone. â™ª

624
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:28,934
â™ª We could just
go home right now â™ª

625
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:31,770
â™ª Or maybe we could
stick around â™ª

626
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:34,689
â™ª For just one more drink â™ª

627
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,891
â™ª Oh, yeah â™ª

628
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:40,620
â™ª Get another bottle out â™ª

629
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:42,205
â™ª Let's shoot the breeze â™ª

630
00:29:42,206 --> 00:29:43,815
â™ª Sit back down â™ª

631
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:46,618
â™ª For just one more drink â™ª

632
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:47,986
â™ª Oh, yeah â™ª

633
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:52,132
â™ª Here's to us,
here's to love â™ª

634
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:55,218
â™ª All the times
that we messed up â™ª

635
00:29:55,219 --> 00:29:56,761
â™ª Here's to you â™ª

636
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:58,630
â™ª Fill the glass â™ª

637
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:01,099
â™ª 'Cause the last few days
have gone too fast â™ª

638
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,419
â™ª So let's give 'em hell â™ª

639
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,147
â™ª Wish everybody well â™ª

640
00:30:07,148 --> 00:30:08,590
â™ª Here's to us â™ª

641
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:11,626
â™ª Here's to us â™ª

642
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:16,823
â™ª We stuck it out
this far together â™ª

643
00:30:16,824 --> 00:30:20,185
â™ª Put our dreams
through the shredder â™ª

644
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:23,939
â™ª Let's toast,
'cause things got better â™ª

645
00:30:26,308 --> 00:30:28,493
â™ª And everything
could change like that â™ª

646
00:30:29,543 --> 00:30:31,588
â™ª And all these years
go by so fast â™ª

647
00:30:31,589 --> 00:30:35,917
â™ª But nothing lasts forever â™ª

648
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:39,930
â™ª Here's to us,
here's to love â™ª

649
00:30:39,931 --> 00:30:43,592
â™ª All the times
that we messed up â™ª

650
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:46,353
â™ª Here's to you,
fill the glass â™ª

651
00:30:46,354 --> 00:30:49,481
â™ª 'Cause the last few nights
have gone too fast â™ª

652
00:30:49,482 --> 00:30:52,192
â™ª If they give you hell â™ª

653
00:30:52,193 --> 00:30:55,195
â™ª Tell them forget themselves â™ª

654
00:30:55,196 --> 00:30:57,105
â™ª Here's to us â™ª

655
00:30:58,224 --> 00:31:01,193
â™ª Here's to us â™ª

656
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:02,894
â™ª Here's to all that we kissed â™ª

657
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:04,454
â™ª And to all that we missed â™ª

658
00:31:04,455 --> 00:31:07,832
â™ª To the biggest mistakes that
we just just wouldn't trade â™ª

659
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:10,735
â™ª To us breakin' out,
without us breakin' down â™ª

660
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:12,988
â™ª To whatever's comin' our way â™ª

661
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:14,990
â™ª Here's to us â™ª

662
00:31:14,991 --> 00:31:19,578
â™ª Here's to us... â™ª
â™ª <i>Here's to us, here's to love</i> â™ª

663
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:21,555
â™ª <i>All the times that
we messed up â™ª</i>

664
00:31:21,556 --> 00:31:23,098
â™ª Here's to you â™ª

665
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:25,550
â™ª Fill the glass â™ª

666
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:28,753
â™ª 'Cause the last few days
have gone too fast â™ª

667
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:31,481
â™ª If they give you hell â™ª

668
00:31:31,482 --> 00:31:33,900
â™ª You tell 'em
forget themselves â™ª

669
00:31:33,901 --> 00:31:36,027
â™ª Here's to us â™ª

670
00:31:36,028 --> 00:31:37,195
â™ª <i>Here's to us</i> â™ª

671
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:38,613
â™ª Oh, here's to us â™ª

672
00:31:38,614 --> 00:31:40,115
â™ª <i>Here's to us</i> â™ª

673
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:41,816
â™ª Here's to us â™ª

674
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,368
â™ª Here's to love â™ª

675
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:46,288
â™ª Wish everybody well â™ª

676
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:47,622
â™ª Here's to us â™ª

677
00:31:47,623 --> 00:31:49,875
â™ª Here's to love â™ª

678
00:31:49,876 --> 00:31:51,543
â™ª Here's to us â™ª

679
00:31:51,544 --> 00:31:53,920
â™ª Here's to us. â™ª

680
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:28,872
I've crossed oceans of time
to bring the results of this

681
00:32:28,873 --> 00:32:32,417
show choir competition.

682
00:32:34,712 --> 00:32:37,923
In third place,

683
00:32:37,924 --> 00:32:40,008
from Our Lady
of Perpetual Sorrow,

684
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:43,720
the Golden Goblets!

685
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:50,435
And now... the moment
you've all been waiting for.

686
00:32:57,525 --> 00:32:59,778
The 2012 Midwest

687
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:00,945
Regional Champion

688
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:02,739
from McKinley High...

689
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:06,072
...the New Directions!

690
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:28,431
Coach Sylvester?

691
00:33:28,432 --> 00:33:30,513
Quinn, thank you for coming.

692
00:33:30,514 --> 00:33:33,645
I know you must be exhausted
from singing all those "oohs"

693
00:33:33,646 --> 00:33:34,984
and background "ahs."

694
00:33:34,985 --> 00:33:36,318
Have a seat.

695
00:33:37,525 --> 00:33:39,955
I've been doing a lot
of thinking this week,

696
00:33:39,956 --> 00:33:43,029
and, um, I don't know if
it's this Karofsky thing

697
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,077
or even seeing you perform,

698
00:33:45,078 --> 00:33:47,117
but I realized something.

699
00:33:47,118 --> 00:33:49,703
I always admired you, Quinn.

700
00:33:51,518 --> 00:33:52,835
At first, I thought
it was because

701
00:33:52,836 --> 00:33:54,207
you reminded me
of a younger,

702
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:56,672
somewhat less striking
Sue Sylvester,

703
00:33:56,673 --> 00:33:59,508
but then I realized
that I admire you

704
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:02,757
for all the ways
you're not like me.

705
00:34:02,758 --> 00:34:06,094
You proved that it's never too
late to turn your life around.

706
00:34:06,095 --> 00:34:07,767
And with that in mind,

707
00:34:07,768 --> 00:34:09,347
I'm giving you this.

708
00:34:16,604 --> 00:34:18,811
You're not gonna regret this.

709
00:34:18,812 --> 00:34:21,526
I'm gonna win us a national
championship in this uniform.

710
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:23,365
Hey, Fabray, looking good.

711
00:34:23,366 --> 00:34:25,363
Thanks, boys.
Catch you later.

712
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:26,865
Hey.

713
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:28,404
How do I look?

714
00:34:28,405 --> 00:34:29,705
Coach Sylvester gave it
to me earlier,

715
00:34:29,706 --> 00:34:30,827
and I couldn't resist.

716
00:34:30,828 --> 00:34:33,075
Well, I'm glad you're happy.

717
00:34:33,076 --> 00:34:34,664
Everyone deserves to be happy.

718
00:34:34,665 --> 00:34:36,862
When you were singing that song,

719
00:34:36,863 --> 00:34:39,419
you were singing it to Finn
and only Finn.

720
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,383
Right?

721
00:34:41,384 --> 00:34:43,798
He really does
make you so happy.

722
00:34:43,799 --> 00:34:46,092
I want to support you,
Rachel, and Finn,

723
00:34:46,093 --> 00:34:48,540
and come to the wedding,

724
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:49,888
if it's not too late.

725
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,827
Can I come in?

726
00:35:14,536 --> 00:35:15,538
The doctors took me off

727
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:17,624
72-hour watch.

728
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:19,459
I get to go home tomorrow.

729
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,085
That's great.

730
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,757
I'm really happy
that you're alive, David.

731
00:35:26,913 --> 00:35:28,426
Me, too.

732
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:40,730
I should have returned
your calls.

733
00:35:40,731 --> 00:35:43,066
Why would you, after the way
I've treated you?

734
00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:44,901
It's okay.
No, it's not

735
00:35:44,902 --> 00:35:47,032
okay.

736
00:35:47,033 --> 00:35:49,151
It's like you said
on Valentine's Day,

737
00:35:49,152 --> 00:35:53,739
I made your life a
living hell for months.

738
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,743
But when the same
thing happened to me,

739
00:35:57,744 --> 00:35:59,624
I couldn't even take
it for a week.

740
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,132
I suppose a best friend
telling me

741
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:05,130
he never wants
to talk to me again,

742
00:36:05,131 --> 00:36:06,422
my mom

743
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,787
telling me
that I have a disease...

744
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,641
...and maybe I can be cured...

745
00:36:16,813 --> 00:36:18,685
I don't know what to do.

746
00:36:21,687 --> 00:36:24,190
I can't go back to that school.

747
00:36:24,191 --> 00:36:26,484
Then go to another school.

748
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:27,986
I'm not gonna
lie to you, it...

749
00:36:27,987 --> 00:36:31,277
it isn't gonna be easy.

750
00:36:31,278 --> 00:36:34,697
And there'll be
some days when...

751
00:36:34,698 --> 00:36:37,833
life just sucks.

752
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,623
But you're gonna get
through this.

753
00:36:40,624 --> 00:36:43,001
'Cause I'm gonna help you.

754
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:45,753
And so is everyone else
who loves you

755
00:36:45,754 --> 00:36:47,839
and accepts you for who you are.

756
00:36:49,546 --> 00:36:52,047
And if they can't
accept that, then...

757
00:36:52,048 --> 00:36:53,928
screw 'em.

758
00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:56,168
Right?

759
00:36:56,169 --> 00:36:58,003
Yeah.

760
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:02,474
This week, um,

761
00:37:02,475 --> 00:37:05,510
Mr. Shue had us think
about something

762
00:37:05,511 --> 00:37:07,317
we're looking forward to
in the future.

763
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:08,568
You want to give it a go?

764
00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:10,028
I don't know.

765
00:37:10,029 --> 00:37:11,617
Come on.

766
00:37:11,618 --> 00:37:12,906
I'll help you.

767
00:37:12,907 --> 00:37:15,120
Close your eyes,

768
00:37:15,121 --> 00:37:19,370
and imagine what life
could be like

769
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:21,377
in ten years.

770
00:37:22,862 --> 00:37:24,375
You're sitting

771
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:27,216
<i>in a fantastic office.</i>

772
00:37:27,217 --> 00:37:29,214
<i>You're some kind
of successful professional.</i>

773
00:37:29,215 --> 00:37:31,299
A lawyer, maybe.

774
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,592
Could I be a sports agent?

775
00:37:32,593 --> 00:37:35,345
Sure.

776
00:37:35,346 --> 00:37:37,593
You're a big sports agent

777
00:37:37,594 --> 00:37:39,599
living in the city
of your dreams

778
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,852
because you left Lima
and never looked back.

779
00:37:43,216 --> 00:37:45,021
<i>Your handsome partner comes
to visit you in your office</i>

780
00:37:45,022 --> 00:37:47,398
<i>and brings along your son.</i>

781
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:49,150
<i>You're taking the rest
of the day off work</i>

782
00:37:49,151 --> 00:37:52,191
<i>because you're taking your son
to his first football game.</i>

783
00:37:53,862 --> 00:37:57,075
You lean over to your partner,
and you say,

784
00:37:57,076 --> 00:37:59,619
"I'm so happy right now."

785
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:07,956
You, uh...

786
00:38:07,957 --> 00:38:10,129
you said last week you wanted
to be friends?

787
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,591
I'd like that.

788
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:16,094
Me, too.

789
00:38:24,478 --> 00:38:26,729
I believe congratulations
are in order.

790
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,975
What do you mean?

791
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:30,643
You've never congratulated me
about anything.

792
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:31,651
Oh, I was

793
00:38:31,652 --> 00:38:33,563
in the audience
at Regionals today,

794
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:36,114
and I thought the Glee Club

795
00:38:36,115 --> 00:38:38,157
was just fantastic.

796
00:38:38,158 --> 00:38:40,159
Now you congratulate me.

797
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,787
Why?
I'm pregnant.

798
00:38:44,474 --> 00:38:46,457
Sue, that's incredible.

799
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:49,168
Wow.
Thank you.

800
00:38:49,169 --> 00:38:51,129
Wait, what are you doing here?

801
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,506
Oh, I wouldn't miss Finn
and Rachel getting married.

802
00:38:53,507 --> 00:38:55,133
I'm crashing.

803
00:38:57,176 --> 00:38:58,671
I think you can win
at Nationals,

804
00:38:58,672 --> 00:38:59,971
and I want to help you.

805
00:38:59,972 --> 00:39:01,431
Are you serious?

806
00:39:01,432 --> 00:39:02,658
I'm a proven champion.

807
00:39:02,659 --> 00:39:03,891
I got some tricks up my sleeve.

808
00:39:03,892 --> 00:39:05,226
What's the catch?

809
00:39:05,227 --> 00:39:08,438
You know, I don't think
there is a catch.

810
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:12,101
I think I really
just want to help you.

811
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:14,193
- Isn't that weird?
- Mm-hmm.

812
00:39:14,194 --> 00:39:16,154
Damn hormones.

813
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:22,111
Okay, could we just have
a show of hands

814
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,679
that we all still think
this is a crazy idea?

815
00:39:24,661 --> 00:39:25,865
Okay, good, that settles it.

816
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:26,873
I'm pulling the plug.

817
00:39:26,874 --> 00:39:29,083
Burt, calm down.
Calm down? Carol, our kids

818
00:39:29,084 --> 00:39:31,169
are getting hitched...
we screwed up big-time.

819
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,378
We started playing
these crazy

820
00:39:32,379 --> 00:39:34,657
reverse psychology games
with them,

821
00:39:34,658 --> 00:39:35,858
look where we are.
The blame game?

822
00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:38,211
- This'll be fun. Bring it, Burt.
- How did we screw up?

823
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:40,178
By raising two kind,

824
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:42,548
wonderful,
independently-minded children?

825
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:43,716
I agree with Burt.

826
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:46,202
They're in love, wunderbar,
but nowhere near ready

827
00:39:46,203 --> 00:39:47,685
for this kind of commitment.

828
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:49,187
At least we're here.

829
00:39:49,188 --> 00:39:50,980
The truth is, if we'd
come down hard on them,

830
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:53,042
they would have gone
behind our back and eloped.

831
00:39:53,043 --> 00:39:54,275
Trust me, I know my son.

832
00:39:54,276 --> 00:39:57,180
Okay? And once he puts
his mind to something,

833
00:39:57,181 --> 00:39:58,731
there is no getting him
off of it.

834
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:01,934
Same with Rachel. At this point,
even Patti LuPone herself

835
00:40:01,935 --> 00:40:03,701
couldn't talk her
out of marrying Finn.

836
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:05,620
- Barbara could.
- Maybe Barbara.

837
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:06,788
- Who's Barbara?
- Streisand.

838
00:40:06,789 --> 00:40:09,075
But, since Babs
is probably shopping

839
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:10,443
in her private
underground mall right now...

840
00:40:10,444 --> 00:40:11,828
you know she has her own mall?

841
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:13,146
Here's what we're gonna do:

842
00:40:13,147 --> 00:40:14,504
When the Justice of the Peace

843
00:40:14,505 --> 00:40:17,399
- says does anybody here object...
- Hell, yeah, I do.

844
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,717
We will all say, "We do."

845
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:21,386
â™ª With feeling. â™ª

846
00:40:21,387 --> 00:40:25,264
Burt, you will run
interference with Finn.

847
00:40:25,265 --> 00:40:28,726
Carol, you will distract
the Justice of the Peace

848
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:30,520
with your feminine wiles.

849
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:33,582
I will hustle Rachel
out the side door

850
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:36,359
and into our waiting car,
where you, LeRoy, will drive...

851
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,903
I don't drive...
straight to Broadway.

852
00:40:38,904 --> 00:40:41,090
And if that doesn't
start to get our baby girl

853
00:40:41,091 --> 00:40:42,198
back on her career track,

854
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:44,200
I don't know what will.
Are we agreed?

855
00:40:44,201 --> 00:40:45,743
Sounds like a plan.

856
00:41:02,175 --> 00:41:03,795
Wow, Rachel, you...

857
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:04,971
You just...

858
00:41:04,972 --> 00:41:07,098
You look...
You do, too.

859
00:41:07,389 --> 00:41:08,750
Ready to go in there?

860
00:41:08,751 --> 00:41:10,602
Just-just-just hold on
just a second.

861
00:41:10,603 --> 00:41:11,686
I-I just want to...

862
00:41:11,687 --> 00:41:15,590
take a second just to...
remember this. Us.

863
00:41:17,234 --> 00:41:19,068
Oh, it's Quinn.
Sorry.

864
00:41:19,069 --> 00:41:21,112
"Ran home to get
my bridesmaids dress.

865
00:41:21,403 --> 00:41:22,781
Be there soon."

866
00:41:22,782 --> 00:41:23,990
Great.

867
00:41:23,991 --> 00:41:26,576
Well, Miss Hudson-Berry,

868
00:41:26,577 --> 00:41:28,786
everybody's waiting.

869
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:30,789
â™ª Goin' to the chapel
and we're â™ª

870
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:36,277
â™ª Gonna get married â™ª

871
00:41:36,278 --> 00:41:38,379
â™ª Goin' to the chapel â™ª

872
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,964
â™ª And we're â™ª

873
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:43,843
â™ª Gonna get married â™ª

874
00:41:43,844 --> 00:41:46,804
â™ª Gee, I really love you â™ª

875
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:50,057
â™ª And we're gonna get married â™ª

876
00:41:51,727 --> 00:41:54,020
â™ª Goin' to the chapel â™ª

877
00:41:54,021 --> 00:41:55,680
â™ª Of love... â™ª

878
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:57,816
Face it, Quinn's not coming.

879
00:41:57,817 --> 00:41:59,017
She said she'd be here, okay?

880
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:00,301
I don't want to start
without her.

881
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:02,070
Is everything okay?

882
00:42:02,071 --> 00:42:03,471
Yeah, we've got
five minutes.

883
00:42:03,472 --> 00:42:05,364
Come on, let's go.
Whew!

884
00:42:05,365 --> 00:42:07,575
â™ª Sky is blue, whoa-oh-oh â™ª

885
00:42:07,576 --> 00:42:09,778
â™ª Birds all sing â™ª

886
00:42:09,779 --> 00:42:13,748
â™ª As if they knew â™ª

887
00:42:13,749 --> 00:42:16,451
â™ª Today's our day â™ª

888
00:42:16,452 --> 00:42:18,502
Looking sharp.
Thanks.

889
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:21,840
- â™ª We'll say I do â™ª
- All right, come on.

890
00:42:21,841 --> 00:42:23,507
â™ª And we'll never
be lonely... â™ª

891
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:25,051
Finn, out.

892
00:42:25,052 --> 00:42:26,711
You can't see the bride
before the wedding.

893
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:28,137
I've already seen her.

894
00:42:28,138 --> 00:42:29,680
But that's bad luck.
No, it's fine.

895
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:31,599
Rachel, we got to go right now,
or we're gonna lose our slot.

896
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,434
Could we please just wait
a couple more minutes

897
00:42:33,435 --> 00:42:35,019
- for Quinn, please?
- It's now or never.

898
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,854
â™ª Gonna get married â™ª

899
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:39,858
â™ª Goin' to the chapel â™ª

900
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:44,111
â™ª And we're gonna get married â™ª

901
00:42:44,112 --> 00:42:45,655
â™ª Gee, I really love you â™ª

902
00:42:45,656 --> 00:42:47,849
If we're gonna do
something, do it now.

903
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:50,952
I'm gonna fake
an epileptic seizure.

904
00:42:50,953 --> 00:42:53,040
You're not an epileptic.

905
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:55,039
- That's why I'm gonna fake it.
- Hurry up.

906
00:42:57,082 --> 00:42:58,543
