1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,600
So that's, you know,
coming along.

2
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,900
I'm working with a vocal coach.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,100
Strengthening the... ah.

4
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:31,100
Lot of guys ignore the laugh and
that's about standards. If you want to

5
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,400
get into the evil league of evil,
you have to have a memorable laugh.

6
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,600
What ? Did you think Bad Horse
didn't work on his neigh ?

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,500
His terrible death weenie.

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,000
No response BTW from
the league yet.

9
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,500
But my application
is strong this year.

10
00:00:51,805 --> 00:00:54,700
A letter of condamnation
from the deputy mayor.

11
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,100
That's gotta have
some weight so...

12
00:00:58,202 --> 00:00:59,709
Fingers crossed !

13
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:02,108
E-mails !

14
00:01:06,309 --> 00:01:10,200
Too-sly-for-you writes "hey,
genius !"

15
00:01:10,508 --> 00:01:13,901
Whoa !
Sarcasm, that's original !

16
00:01:16,606 --> 00:01:19,302
"Where are the gold bars you
were supposed to pull out

17
00:01:19,407 --> 00:01:21,901
of that bank vault with
your transmatter ray ?"

18
00:01:22,105 --> 00:01:25,300
"Obviously it failed or it
would be in the papers."

19
00:01:25,316 --> 00:01:29,200
Well, no, they're not gonna say
anything in the press but...

20
00:01:29,308 --> 00:01:30,800
behold !

21
00:01:31,608 --> 00:01:36,703
Transported from
there to here !

22
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:43,303
The molecules tend to
shift during the...

23
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:46,901
transmatter.... uh... advance.

24
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:52,502
But they were
transported in bar form.

25
00:01:52,906 --> 00:01:55,201
And they clearly were...

26
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:57,103
And by the way it's
not about making money,

27
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:58,703
it's about taking money.

28
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:01,102
Destroying the status quo

29
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:05,203
because the status is not quo.

30
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:08,800
The world is a
mess and I just...

31
00:02:08,907 --> 00:02:11,003
need to rule it.

32
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:12,803
I'm gonna...

33
00:02:13,308 --> 00:02:15,002
Smells like cuman.

34
00:02:16,108 --> 00:02:19,202
So transmatter is 75%.

35
00:02:19,508 --> 00:02:23,201
And more importantly the
freeze ray is almost up.

36
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:25,800
This is the one.

37
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:27,302
It stops time.

38
00:02:27,406 --> 00:02:29,800
Freeze ray. Tell your friends.

39
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:39,602
We have... Oh, here's one from
our good friend Johnny Snow.

40
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:46,103
"Dr. Horrible, I see you are once again
afraid to do battle with your nemesis.

41
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:51,001
I waited at Dully Park for
45 minutes." Okay, dude.

42
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:53,801
You're not my nemesis.

43
00:02:54,405 --> 00:02:58,901
My nemesis is Captain Hammer.

44
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:03,003
Captain Hammer corporate tool.

45
00:03:04,005 --> 00:03:06,401
He dislocasted my shoulder.

46
00:03:06,415 --> 00:03:09,803
Again. Last week.

47
00:03:10,405 --> 00:03:13,201
Look, I'm just trying to
change the world, okay ?

48
00:03:13,506 --> 00:03:17,900
I don't have time for a grudge
match with every poser in a park.

49
00:03:18,508 --> 00:03:21,401
Besides there's kids
in that park so...

50
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:27,100
Here's one
from dead-not-sleeping.

51
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:31,603
Long time watcher, first time writing.
Blah blah blah blah.

52
00:03:31,617 --> 00:03:34,203
"You always say in your blog
that you will show her the way,

53
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:38,001
show her you're a true villain.
Who is her ?

54
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:43,300
And does she even
know that you're...

55
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:55,102
Laundry day... See you there.

56
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:58,303
Under things... tumbelling.

57
00:03:58,707 --> 00:04:01,901
Wanna say... "Love your hair"

58
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:05,101
Here I go... mumbling.

59
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:09,102
With my freeze
ray I will stop...

60
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:11,203
the world.

61
00:04:12,106 --> 00:04:18,000
With my freeze ray I will find
the time to find the words to...

62
00:04:18,705 --> 00:04:20,201
tell you how...

63
00:04:20,505 --> 00:04:23,303
how you make... make me feel.

64
00:04:23,705 --> 00:04:25,201
What's the phrase ?

65
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:27,003
Like a fool.

66
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:28,601
Kinda sick.

67
00:04:28,805 --> 00:04:30,003
Special needs.

68
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:35,700
Anyways... with my freeze
ray I will stop...

69
00:04:35,905 --> 00:04:37,403
the pain.

70
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:44,600
It's not a death ray or an ice beam,
that's right Johnny Snow.

71
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,700
I just think that
you need time to know

72
00:04:47,905 --> 00:04:51,203
that I'm the guy
to make it real.

73
00:04:51,308 --> 00:04:54,601
The feelings you
don't dare to feel.

74
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:57,802
I'll bend the
world to our will.

75
00:04:58,008 --> 00:05:04,901
And we'll make
time stand still.

76
00:05:12,407 --> 00:05:13,702
That's the plan.

77
00:05:13,905 --> 00:05:15,400
Rule the world.

78
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,803
You and me. Any day.

79
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:20,903
- Love your hair.
- What ?

80
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:23,401
No, I love the air.

81
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:29,100
Anyway, with my freeze
ray I will stop...

82
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:33,600
- Hey, doc.
- Moist, my heroe.

83
00:05:33,808 --> 00:05:36,002
Moisture, buddy,
what's going on ?

84
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:38,200
Life of crime. Got your mail.

85
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,400
Hey, didn't you go on
a date last night ?

86
00:05:44,607 --> 00:05:47,503
Conflict Diamond told me you were
doubling with Bait And Switch.

87
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:48,400
Yeah.

88
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:50,301
Yeah ?

89
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:54,801
It was alright. I kinda thought I was
supposed to end up with Bait but...

90
00:05:54,908 --> 00:05:55,803
I hear you.

91
00:05:57,308 --> 00:05:58,803
I saw Penny today.

92
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,500
You talked to her ?

93
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:01,302
So close.

94
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:07,403
Just a few weeks from a
real audible connection.

95
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:10,401
I'm gonna ask...

96
00:06:12,007 --> 00:06:14,100
Oh my God !

97
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:15,303
Is that from the league ?

98
00:06:15,506 --> 00:06:17,400
It's from him,
that's his seal, isn't it ?

99
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:19,800
The leader ? Oh my God !

100
00:06:20,108 --> 00:06:22,001
I got a letter from Bad Horse !

101
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:24,602
That's so hardcore.
Bad Horse is legend,

102
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:27,102
he rules the league with an iron hoof.
Are you sure...

103
00:06:27,308 --> 00:06:29,800
Bad Horse !

104
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:31,201
He rides across the nation

105
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,803
the thorough bread of sin.

106
00:06:33,006 --> 00:06:35,702
He got the application
that you just sent in.

107
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:38,900
It needs evaluation so
let the games begin.

108
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:40,701
A heinous crime to
show of course.

109
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:42,500
A murder would be
nice of course.

110
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:44,802
Bad Horse... is bad !

111
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,801
The evil league of evil
is watching so beware !

112
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,800
The grade that you receive
will be the last we swear.

113
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:54,603
so make the Bad Horse proud
or he'll make you his mare.

114
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:56,101
You saddled up,
there's no recourse.

115
00:06:56,306 --> 00:06:58,703
It high ho silver,
side that horse.

116
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:02,201
- I don't know.
- Are you kidding ?

117
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,402
This is great !

118
00:07:04,506 --> 00:07:05,902
I'm about to pull
a major heist !

119
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:08,701
You know, the Wonderflonium that
I need for the freeze ray ?

120
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:10,501
It's being
transported tomorrow !

121
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:11,800
Armored car ?

122
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:14,402
Carrier van. Candy for a baby.

123
00:07:14,415 --> 00:07:18,500
Do you need anything
dampened or made soggy ?

124
00:07:18,707 --> 00:07:22,103
Thanks but...
the league is watching.

125
00:07:23,605 --> 00:07:25,801
I gotta do this alone.

126
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,600
Will you lend a caring hand

127
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,700
to shelter those who need it ?

128
00:07:39,407 --> 00:07:42,201
You only have to
sign your name.

129
00:07:42,408 --> 00:07:45,400
Don't even have to read it.

130
00:07:45,806 --> 00:07:49,402
Would you help...
No ? How about you ?

131
00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:36,702
- Will you lend a caring hand...
- Ah !

132
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:41,803
What ?

133
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,800
I was wondering if
I could just...

134
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:47,501
Hey !

135
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:49,302
I know you.

136
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:51,003
Hello. You know me. Cool !

137
00:08:51,107 --> 00:08:54,701
I mean...
yeah, you do. Do you ?

138
00:08:55,006 --> 00:08:56,001
From the laundromat.

139
00:08:56,105 --> 00:08:59,301
Wednesdays and Saturdays except twice
last month you skipped a weekend.

140
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:02,201
Or... if that was you.
Could have been someone else.

141
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:03,901
I mean, I've seen you.

142
00:09:04,507 --> 00:09:05,902
Billy is my name.

143
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:07,500
I'm Penny.

144
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,700
What are you doing ?

145
00:09:10,902 --> 00:09:12,409
Hmmm texting.

146
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:14,508
It's very important
or I would stop.

147
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:15,903
What are you doing ?

148
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:19,903
Actually, I'm out here volunteering
for the Caring Hands homeless shelter.

149
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:21,103
Can you spare a minute ?

150
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:25,102
Hum...

151
00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:27,502
Okay, go.

152
00:09:28,605 --> 00:09:32,003
We're hoping to open a new
location soon. Expand our efforts.

153
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:33,602
There's this great
building nearby

154
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,702
that the city is just gonna demolish
and turn into a parking lot.

155
00:09:36,907 --> 00:09:39,803
- But if we get enough signatures...
- Signatures ?

156
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:42,003
Yeah.

157
00:09:42,606 --> 00:09:44,100
I'm sorry. Go on.

158
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:45,401
I was saying...

159
00:09:45,705 --> 00:09:48,601
Maybe we could get the city to
donate the building to our cause.

160
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:51,103
We would be able to
pry 250 new beds,

161
00:09:51,116 --> 00:09:54,802
get people off the streets and
into job training so they could

162
00:09:55,006 --> 00:09:59,102
buy rocket packs and go to
the Moon and become florists.

163
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:01,603
You're not really interested
in the homeless, are you ?

164
00:10:02,106 --> 00:10:05,600
No, I am.
But they're a symptom.

165
00:10:05,808 --> 00:10:08,900
You're treating a symptom
and the disease rages on,

166
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:12,601
consumes the human race.
The fish rots from the head as they say.

167
00:10:12,807 --> 00:10:14,702
So my thinking is why
not cut off the head.

168
00:10:15,308 --> 00:10:17,102
Of the human race ?

169
00:10:18,405 --> 00:10:20,601
It's not a perfect metaphor

170
00:10:20,617 --> 00:10:23,501
but I'm talking about an
overall of the system.

171
00:10:23,605 --> 00:10:28,101
Putting the power
in different hands.

172
00:10:28,116 --> 00:10:30,300
I'm all for that !

173
00:10:32,106 --> 00:10:34,603
- This petition is about the building.
- I'd love to sign it.

174
00:10:34,706 --> 00:10:35,902
Thank you !

175
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:42,203
Sorry, I come on strong.

176
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,603
But you signed !

177
00:10:43,806 --> 00:10:47,901
I don't wanna turn my back on
a fellow laundering person.

178
00:10:48,205 --> 00:10:50,603
Well, if we can't stick together,
I don't...

179
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:56,901
I'll probably see you there.

180
00:10:59,606 --> 00:11:01,501
No, I will. I...

181
00:11:08,606 --> 00:11:10,703
She talked to me.

182
00:11:12,307 --> 00:11:14,801
Why did she talk to me now ?

183
00:11:17,606 --> 00:11:19,501
Maybe I should...

184
00:11:21,408 --> 00:11:27,302
A man's gotta do what
a man's gotta do.

185
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:34,900
Don't plan the plan if
you can't follow through.

186
00:11:35,107 --> 00:11:41,902
All that matters is taking
matters into your own hands.

187
00:11:42,006 --> 00:11:45,601
Soon I'll control everything.

188
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:47,202
Hey ! Hey !

189
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:50,000
My wish is your command !

190
00:11:50,206 --> 00:11:52,801
Stand back everyone !
Nothing here to see !

191
00:11:52,906 --> 00:11:56,300
Just imminent danger and
in the middle of it : me !

192
00:11:56,318 --> 00:11:59,902
Captain Hammer's here !
Hair bowing in the breeze !

193
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:03,501
The day needs my
saving expertise !

194
00:12:03,707 --> 00:12:10,003
A man's gotta do what
a man's gotta do.

195
00:12:10,905 --> 00:12:17,703
His destiny ends
with me saving you.

196
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:24,803
The only doom that's glooming
is you loving me to tears.

197
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:30,003
I'll give you a second
to catch your breath.

198
00:12:34,107 --> 00:12:35,702
You idiot !

199
00:12:35,906 --> 00:12:38,102
Dr. Horrible, I should have
known you were behind this !

200
00:12:38,206 --> 00:12:40,323
- You almost killed her !
- I remember it differently.

201
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:41,303
If she...

202
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:43,602
It's curtains for you,
Dr. Horrible.

203
00:12:43,706 --> 00:12:46,400
Lacey gently wafting curtains.

204
00:12:47,905 --> 00:12:51,601
Thank you, Hammer man,
I don't think I can

205
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:55,303
explain how important it was
that you stopped the van.

206
00:12:55,605 --> 00:12:59,202
I'd be splattered,
I'd be crushed in the debris.

207
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:02,601
Thank you, sir, for saving me !

208
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:03,602
Don't worry about it !

209
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:08,002
A man's gotta do what
a man's gotta do.

210
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:11,601
- You came from above.
- Are you kidding ?

211
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:15,803
What heist were you watching ?

212
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:18,402
Stop looking at her like that.

213
00:13:20,905 --> 00:13:24,203
Did you notice that he
threw you in the garbage ?

214
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:27,401
- My heart is beating...
- When ass needs kicking,

215
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,602
- when bombs are ticking...
- I stopped the van !

216
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:33,502
The remote control
was in my hand !

217
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:38,602
Whatever !

218
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:44,501
So please give me a second
to catch my breath.

219
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:47,101
Balls !

220
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,502
Any dope with half a brain

221
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:06,302
can see the human
kind has gone insane

222
00:14:07,008 --> 00:14:10,700
to the point where I don't know
if I'll upset the status quo

223
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,900
if I throw poison
in the water main.

224
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:18,400
Listen close to
everybody's heart

225
00:14:18,418 --> 00:14:22,102
and hear that breaking sound.

226
00:14:22,306 --> 00:14:25,702
Hopes and dreams
are shattering apart

227
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:29,501
and crashing to the ground.

228
00:14:29,707 --> 00:14:33,200
I can not believe my eyes

229
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:37,000
how the world is filled
with filth and lies.

230
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:43,300
But it's plain to see
evil inside of me...

231
00:14:43,608 --> 00:14:50,602
is on the rise.

232
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:55,003
Look around

233
00:14:55,105 --> 00:14:58,702
we're living with
the lost and found.

234
00:14:58,805 --> 00:15:02,503
Just when you feel
you've almost drown,

235
00:15:02,516 --> 00:15:06,103
you find yourself
on solid ground.

236
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:10,802
And you believe there's
good in everybody's heart.

237
00:15:11,007 --> 00:15:14,601
Keep it safe and sound.

238
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:18,301
With hope you can do your part

239
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:22,102
to turn a life around.

240
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:25,603
I can not believe my eyes.

241
00:15:25,706 --> 00:15:29,403
Is the world finally
growing wise ?

242
00:15:29,507 --> 00:15:32,502
'Cause it seems to me

243
00:15:32,706 --> 00:15:35,902
some kind of harmony

244
00:15:36,006 --> 00:15:41,403
is on the rise.

245
00:15:44,906 --> 00:15:47,602
Make it slow.

246
00:15:47,617 --> 00:15:51,103
He looks at me
and seems to know

247
00:15:51,306 --> 00:15:55,003
the things that
I'm afraid to show

248
00:15:55,107 --> 00:15:58,601
and suddenly I feel this glow.

249
00:15:58,808 --> 00:16:03,502
And I believe there's good
in everybody's heart.

250
00:16:03,608 --> 00:16:07,401
And keep that safe and sound.

251
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:11,002
Hopes and dreams
are shattering apart

252
00:16:11,106 --> 00:16:14,603
and crashing to the ground.

253
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:18,201
I can not believe my eyes.

254
00:16:18,306 --> 00:16:22,103
Is the world finally
growing wise ?

255
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:25,400
But it's plain to see

256
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:28,602
- evil inside of me
- rapture inside of me

257
00:16:28,706 --> 00:16:35,000
is on the rise.

258
00:16:41,506 --> 00:16:44,700
It is so dumb that we're been coming
here so long and never spoke.

259
00:16:44,807 --> 00:16:48,601
I know, all those months doing
this stunningly boring choir.

260
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:51,203
I'm a fan of laundering.

261
00:16:51,408 --> 00:16:53,102
I love it !

262
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:54,903
To smell the fabric softener...

263
00:16:55,006 --> 00:16:56,901
the warm clothes
in your hands...

264
00:16:57,107 --> 00:16:58,103
So good !

265
00:16:58,408 --> 00:16:59,801
Hey, this is weird.

266
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:03,300
I ordered one frozen yogurt
and they gave me two.

267
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:05,401
You don't happen to like frozen yogurt,
do you ?

268
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:06,502
I love it !

269
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:08,703
You're kidding !
What a crazy random happenstance.

270
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:10,403
- Here.
- Thank you.

271
00:17:17,605 --> 00:17:19,303
So how was your weekend ?

272
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:22,502
Did you spend the whole time
hunting wild signatures ?

273
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,703
Actually, I went on a date.

274
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:29,402
Get right out of town.
How was that ?

275
00:17:29,806 --> 00:17:31,402
Unexpected.

276
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:34,403
He's a really
good-looking guy and

277
00:17:34,606 --> 00:17:36,301
I thought he was
kinda cheesy at first.

278
00:17:36,406 --> 00:17:37,501
Trust your instinct.

279
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:39,300
But he turned out to
be totally sweet.

280
00:17:40,806 --> 00:17:42,703
Sometimes people are
layered like that.

281
00:17:42,907 --> 00:17:44,800
There's something totally
different underneath

282
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:46,901
than what's on the surface.

283
00:17:47,005 --> 00:17:50,203
And sometimes there's
a 3rd even deeper level

284
00:17:50,508 --> 00:17:53,403
and that one is the same
as the top surface one.

285
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:57,301
- Huh ?
- Like with pie.

286
00:17:57,405 --> 00:17:59,602
So are you gonna
see him again ?

287
00:18:00,206 --> 00:18:01,703
I think I will.

288
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,002
- Billy ?
- Yeah.

289
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:07,900
You're driving this
fork in your leg.

290
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:11,802
So I am. Hilarious !

291
00:18:17,408 --> 00:18:20,000
Alright, the wait is over.

292
00:18:20,205 --> 00:18:22,603
This, my friends,
is my freeze ray

293
00:18:22,705 --> 00:18:25,700
which with the addition of
the Wonderflonium I obtained

294
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:28,400
at my famously successful
heist last week.

295
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:31,603
I say successful in that
I achieved my objective.

296
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:33,403
It was less successful in that

297
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:37,003
I inadvertantly introduced my
archnemesis to the girl of my dreams.

298
00:18:37,206 --> 00:18:39,003
And now he's taking
her out on dates

299
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:42,500
and they're probably going
to french kiss or something.

300
00:18:43,605 --> 00:18:47,500
She called him "sweet".
How is he "sweet" ?

301
00:18:49,207 --> 00:18:51,300
Right! Freeze ray !

302
00:18:51,705 --> 00:18:56,502
So, as of tonight,
I am in the evil league of evil

303
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:59,300
if all goes according to plan,
which it will,

304
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:02,800
'cause I hold a PhD
in horribleness.

305
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:05,202
See you at the aftermath.
Peace !

306
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:07,803
But not literally.

307
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:13,903
Well... the freeze
ray needs work.

308
00:19:14,706 --> 00:19:18,102
I also need to be a little bit more
careful about what I say on this blog.

309
00:19:18,206 --> 00:19:22,602
Apparently the LAPD and Captain
Hammer are among our viewers.

310
00:19:23,508 --> 00:19:26,603
They were waiting for me
at the Mayor's dedication

311
00:19:26,805 --> 00:19:29,200
of the Superhero
Memorial Bridge.

312
00:19:29,306 --> 00:19:33,402
The freeze ray takes a few
seconds to warm up and I wasn't...

313
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:37,901
Captain Hammer threw
a car at my head.

314
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:42,002
Not to worry though
'cause I'm...

315
00:19:42,205 --> 00:19:43,701
One sec.

316
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:47,002
He saw the operation
you tried to pull today.

317
00:19:47,106 --> 00:19:49,802
Your humiliation means
he still votes nay.

318
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:53,702
And now assassination
is just the only way.

319
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:55,501
There will be blood,
it might be yours

320
00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:57,803
so go kill someone.
Signed Bad Horse.

321
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,303
Kill someone ?

322
00:20:01,606 --> 00:20:02,700
Would you do it ?

323
00:20:02,907 --> 00:20:04,601
To get into the evil
league of evil ?

324
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:06,801
Look at me, man ! I'm moist !

325
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:10,501
At my most badass, I make people feel
like they want to take a shower.

326
00:20:10,515 --> 00:20:12,300
I'm not ELE material.

327
00:20:12,505 --> 00:20:16,001
Killing is not elegant or creative.
It's not my style.

328
00:20:16,206 --> 00:20:20,001
You got more than enough evil hours
to get into the henchman's union.

329
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,603
I'm not a henchman.

330
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:23,600
I'm Dr. Horrible.

331
00:20:23,706 --> 00:20:26,600
I've got a PhD in horribleness.

332
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:29,401
Is that the new catchphrase ?

333
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:32,100
I deserve to get in.
You know I do.

334
00:20:32,207 --> 00:20:34,203
But killing ? Really ?

335
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:38,400
Hourglass says she knows a kid in Iowa
who grows up to become president.

336
00:20:38,607 --> 00:20:40,400
That'd be big.

337
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:43,003
I'm not gonna kill
a little kid.

338
00:20:43,206 --> 00:20:45,700
- Smother an old lady ?
- Do I even know you ?

339
00:20:45,806 --> 00:20:47,702
I just, you know,
really think I'm...

340
00:20:47,906 --> 00:20:50,102
qualified for this job.

341
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,403
And... I just can't get
my foot in the door.

342
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,801
I'm sure you will.

343
00:20:53,908 --> 00:20:55,702
I wanna do great things,
you know.

344
00:20:55,905 --> 00:20:59,400
I wanna be an achiever
like Bad Horse.

345
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:01,503
The 3rd bread of sin ?

346
00:21:02,806 --> 00:21:04,901
I meant Ghandi.

347
00:21:06,506 --> 00:21:10,000
Well, I've been turned
down from plenty of jobs.

348
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:11,703
Even fired a few times.

349
00:21:12,007 --> 00:21:13,803
I can't imagine
anybody firing you.

350
00:21:14,008 --> 00:21:15,503
Neither could I.

351
00:21:15,805 --> 00:21:18,200
Now I can visualize
it really well.

352
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:23,002
- But you know everything happens...
- Don't say for a reason.

353
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:27,703
No, I'm just saying that...
everything happens.

354
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:29,502
Not to me.

355
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:37,903
Here's the story of a girl
who grew up lost and lonely.

356
00:21:38,305 --> 00:21:41,100
Thinking love was fairy tale

357
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:46,402
and trouble was
made only for me.

358
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,900
Even in the darkness

359
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:54,403
every color can be found.

360
00:21:54,706 --> 00:21:58,901
And everyday your
rain brings water

361
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:04,902
flowing to things
growing in the ground.

362
00:22:06,705 --> 00:22:09,403
Grief replaced with pity

363
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:12,901
for a city barely copping.

364
00:22:13,305 --> 00:22:16,600
Dreams are easy to achieve

365
00:22:16,707 --> 00:22:21,203
if hope is all
I'm hoping to be.

366
00:22:22,206 --> 00:22:29,301
Anytime you hurt there's
one who has it worse around.

367
00:22:29,908 --> 00:22:35,101
And every drop of rain
will keep you growing,

368
00:22:35,306 --> 00:22:40,601
feeds your soul
within the ground.

369
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:44,300
So keep your head
up Billy buddy.

370
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,603
It's like Captain Hammer
is always saying.

371
00:22:49,805 --> 00:22:51,000
Right !

372
00:22:51,408 --> 00:22:54,501
How are things with
Cheesy on the outside ?

373
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:56,200
Good. They're good.

374
00:22:56,405 --> 00:22:57,600
He's nice.

375
00:22:58,306 --> 00:23:00,301
I'll be interested to know
what you think of him.

376
00:23:00,316 --> 00:23:01,803
He said he might stop by.

377
00:23:02,108 --> 00:23:04,203
- Stop by here ?
- Yeah.

378
00:23:05,607 --> 00:23:08,102
Oh, goodness !
Look at my wrist ! I gotta go !

379
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:10,502
But what about your clothes ?

380
00:23:12,305 --> 00:23:14,100
I don't want these. See you !

381
00:23:14,306 --> 00:23:16,101
- Oh, pardon.
- Pardon !

382
00:23:17,108 --> 00:23:18,703
Billy, this is Captain Hammer.

383
00:23:18,905 --> 00:23:21,602
Oh, Billy, the laundry buddy.
It's very nice to meet you.

384
00:23:21,707 --> 00:23:23,303
We're meeting now
for the first time.

385
00:23:23,508 --> 00:23:24,902
You look horrobly familiar.

386
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:26,502
One of those faces I guess.

387
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:28,203
Have I seen you at the gym ?

388
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:29,500
At the gym, yeah.

389
00:23:29,706 --> 00:23:32,501
I don't go to the gym,
I'm just naturally like this.

390
00:23:32,806 --> 00:23:34,002
Oh, well.

391
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:37,903
Who wants to know what the Mayor
is doing behind closed doors ?

392
00:23:38,205 --> 00:23:43,300
He is signing over a certain
building to a Caring Hands group

393
00:23:43,317 --> 00:23:45,101
as a new homeless shelter.

394
00:23:45,205 --> 00:23:46,803
- Oh my God !
- Yep !

395
00:23:47,006 --> 00:23:48,801
Apparently the only
signature he needed

396
00:23:49,008 --> 00:23:50,902
was my fist.

397
00:23:51,506 --> 00:23:53,202
But with a pen in it.

398
00:23:53,305 --> 00:23:55,000
That I was signing with.

399
00:23:55,405 --> 00:23:56,903
I can't believe it.

400
00:23:57,407 --> 00:23:59,903
- Congratulations.
- Thank you ! Thank you !

401
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:02,801
Oh !

402
00:24:04,206 --> 00:24:06,401
Well, this is great.
I wish I could stay and chitchat.

403
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,601
It sure was nice to meet you...

404
00:24:09,617 --> 00:24:11,001
Doctor.

405
00:24:12,506 --> 00:24:15,000
You've got a little crush,
don't you doc ?

406
00:24:15,108 --> 00:24:17,302
Well, that's gonna make
this hard to hear.

407
00:24:17,808 --> 00:24:20,602
See, later I'm gonna take
little Penny back to my place.

408
00:24:21,105 --> 00:24:22,901
Show her the command center.

409
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:25,700
The Hammer-cycle.
Maybe even the Ham-jet.

410
00:24:25,806 --> 00:24:27,703
You think she likes me now ?

411
00:24:27,906 --> 00:24:31,801
I'm gonna give Penny
the night of her life.

412
00:24:31,906 --> 00:24:34,301
Just because you want her.

413
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:36,303
And I get

414
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:38,200
what you want.

415
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:42,700
See, Penny's giving it up.
She's giving it up hard.

416
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:45,003
'Cause she's with
Captain Hammer.

417
00:24:45,407 --> 00:24:46,602
And these...

418
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:49,100
are not the hammer.

419
00:24:55,308 --> 00:24:57,600
The hammer is my penis.

420
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:15,201
This appeared as a moral dilemma
'cause at first it was weird

421
00:25:15,216 --> 00:25:18,300
though I swore to eliminate the worst
of the plague that devoured humanity

422
00:25:18,506 --> 00:25:21,301
it's true I was vague on the
how so can it be that you

423
00:25:21,317 --> 00:25:23,901
have shown me the light.

424
00:25:24,006 --> 00:25:27,600
It's a brand new day
and the sun is high.

425
00:25:27,706 --> 00:25:31,502
All the birds are singing
that you're gonna die.

426
00:25:31,707 --> 00:25:35,903
How I hesitated
now I wonder why.

427
00:25:35,918 --> 00:25:38,602
It's a brand new day.

428
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:42,600
All the time that you beat
me unconscious I forget.

429
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,581
All the crimes incomplete,
listen, honestly I'll live.

430
00:25:44,618 --> 00:25:46,801
Mr. Coup. Mr. right. Mr.
Know-it-all is through.

431
00:25:46,816 --> 00:25:49,402
Now the future's so bright
and I owe it all to you.

432
00:25:49,607 --> 00:25:51,801
You've shown me the light.

433
00:25:51,907 --> 00:25:55,702
It's a brand new me.
I've got no remorse.

434
00:25:55,808 --> 00:25:59,500
Now the water's rising
but I know the course.

435
00:25:59,515 --> 00:26:03,801
I'm gonna shock the world,
I'm gonna show Bad Horse.

436
00:26:03,905 --> 00:26:06,200
It's a brand new day.

437
00:26:06,306 --> 00:26:09,700
And Penny will see the evil me.

438
00:26:09,715 --> 00:26:13,902
Not a joke, not a dork,
not a failure.

439
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:17,501
And she may cry but
her tears will dry

440
00:26:17,705 --> 00:26:24,201
when I hand her the keys
to a shiny new Australia.

441
00:26:24,218 --> 00:26:28,000
It's a brand new day.
Yeah, the sun is high.

442
00:26:28,108 --> 00:26:31,602
All the angels sing
because you're gonna die.

443
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:37,702
Go ahead and laugh.
Yeah, I'm a funny guy.

444
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:42,001
Tell everyone goodbye !

445
00:26:44,006 --> 00:26:46,502
It's a brand new day.

446
00:26:50,657 --> 00:26:53,221
Looks like we're finding
out what a true hero is.

447
00:26:53,776 --> 00:26:57,362
The Mayor himself will be on hand to
dedicate the new homeless shelter

448
00:26:57,597 --> 00:27:00,180
and unveil the statue
of Captain Hammer.

449
00:27:01,098 --> 00:27:02,930
It's a good day to be homeless.

450
00:27:04,198 --> 00:27:05,651
It certainly is.

451
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:18,962
So they say Captain
Hammer's become a crusader,

452
00:27:19,165 --> 00:27:22,372
political, he's cleaning
off the streets.

453
00:27:22,525 --> 00:27:23,482
About time.

454
00:27:24,088 --> 00:27:26,392
So they say that
it's real love.

455
00:27:26,556 --> 00:27:28,111
So romantic.

456
00:27:28,878 --> 00:27:30,253
He signed this.

457
00:27:30,457 --> 00:27:33,051
So they say we'll have
blankets and beds

458
00:27:33,196 --> 00:27:36,622
we can open by Monday
thanks to you.

459
00:27:36,796 --> 00:27:38,230
Thanks to me.

460
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:42,152
It's the perfect story.

461
00:27:42,508 --> 00:27:45,742
- So they say.
- A heroe leading the way.

462
00:27:46,075 --> 00:27:48,823
Hammer's call to glory.

463
00:27:48,998 --> 00:27:51,171
Let's all be our best.

464
00:27:51,288 --> 00:27:53,062
Next up : who's gay ?!

465
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:57,612
So they say he saved her life.

466
00:27:58,127 --> 00:28:00,631
They say she works
with the homeless

467
00:28:00,757 --> 00:28:05,032
and doesn't even meet.
We have a problem with her.

468
00:28:05,436 --> 00:28:07,062
This is his hair.

469
00:28:07,965 --> 00:28:09,983
This is so nice.

470
00:28:10,268 --> 00:28:13,372
I just might sleep at
the same girl twice.

471
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:15,741
They say it's better
the 2nd time.

472
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:18,861
They say you get to
do the weird stuff.

473
00:28:19,226 --> 00:28:21,352
We do the weird stuff.

474
00:28:22,106 --> 00:28:24,993
This is perfect for me.

475
00:28:25,566 --> 00:28:28,952
So they say.
I guess he's pretty okay.

476
00:28:29,197 --> 00:28:31,653
After years of storm,

477
00:28:31,838 --> 00:28:36,960
they say that I've
finally found the way.

478
00:28:41,567 --> 00:28:43,233
He's still not picking up.

479
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,720
There's no happy ending.

480
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,523
So they say.

481
00:28:48,678 --> 00:28:50,393
Not for me anyway.

482
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:53,361
Shoud I stop pretending ?

483
00:28:53,527 --> 00:28:59,451
Take the chance to
build a brand new day ?

484
00:29:00,068 --> 00:29:02,472
This is his dry-cleaning bill

485
00:29:02,627 --> 00:29:04,742
for his sweater vest.

486
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:09,710
And in just a few minutes,

487
00:29:09,867 --> 00:29:13,310
we'll unveil the statue
of the man himself.

488
00:29:14,975 --> 00:29:16,062
Thank you.

489
00:29:16,608 --> 00:29:17,693
Thank you !

490
00:29:18,308 --> 00:29:19,581
Justice has a name.

491
00:29:19,747 --> 00:29:22,271
And the name that it has,
besides justice,

492
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:24,533
is Captain Hammer.

493
00:29:24,717 --> 00:29:26,142
Ladies and gentlemen,

494
00:29:26,276 --> 00:29:28,002
your heroe.

495
00:29:37,296 --> 00:29:38,360
Thank you.

496
00:29:39,356 --> 00:29:41,080
Thank you, Mayor,
for those kind words.

497
00:29:43,165 --> 00:29:44,901
I hate the homeless.

498
00:29:45,426 --> 00:29:47,643
This problem that
plagues our city.

499
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:50,472
Everyone should
have the basic...

500
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,282
You know what?
I don't need tiny cue cards.

501
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,773
When I fell deeply in love

502
00:29:57,966 --> 00:30:01,753
with my serious long-term girlfriend
Penny. Wave your hand, Penny.

503
00:30:03,556 --> 00:30:06,513
There she is. Cute, huh ?

504
00:30:06,668 --> 00:30:11,193
Sort of a quiet nerdy thing.
Not my usual but nice.

505
00:30:11,348 --> 00:30:12,431
Anyway...

506
00:30:13,137 --> 00:30:19,172
She turned me on to this whole
homeless thing which is terrible.

507
00:30:19,335 --> 00:30:20,922
And I realised

508
00:30:21,077 --> 00:30:24,291
I'm not the only hero
in the room tonight.

509
00:30:24,705 --> 00:30:27,553
I'm not the only
one who's fighting.

510
00:30:28,806 --> 00:30:31,271
It may not be too classy

511
00:30:31,516 --> 00:30:33,732
begging just to eat.

512
00:30:33,888 --> 00:30:36,340
You know who does
that ? Lassie.

513
00:30:36,485 --> 00:30:38,920
And she always gets a treat.

514
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,513
So you wonder what your part is

515
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:44,113
'cause you're homeless
and depressed.

516
00:30:44,297 --> 00:30:46,723
But home is where the heart is.

517
00:30:46,876 --> 00:30:51,512
So your real home's
in your chest.

518
00:30:52,397 --> 00:30:57,021
Everyone's a hero
in their own way.

519
00:30:57,626 --> 00:31:02,040
Everyone's got villains
they must face.

520
00:31:02,716 --> 00:31:04,703
They're not as cool as mine

521
00:31:05,136 --> 00:31:10,232
but folks you know it's
fine to know your place.

522
00:31:10,526 --> 00:31:15,393
Everyone's a hero
in their own way.

523
00:31:15,758 --> 00:31:20,512
In their own not
that heroic way.

524
00:31:20,805 --> 00:31:23,102
So I thank my
girlfriend, Penny.

525
00:31:23,397 --> 00:31:25,581
Yeah, we totally had sex.

526
00:31:26,056 --> 00:31:28,372
She showed me there's so many

527
00:31:28,578 --> 00:31:31,171
different muscles I can flex.

528
00:31:31,305 --> 00:31:33,781
There's the dontoids
of compassion.

529
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:36,393
There's the abs of being kind.

530
00:31:36,567 --> 00:31:39,043
It's not enough
to bash in heads

531
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:44,181
you've got to bash in minds.

532
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:48,992
Everyone's a hero
in their own way.

533
00:31:49,715 --> 00:31:54,502
Everyone's got
something they can do.

534
00:31:54,927 --> 00:31:57,053
Get up, go out and fly

535
00:31:57,468 --> 00:32:01,941
especially that guy,
he smells like pooh.

536
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:07,103
Everyone's a hero
in their own way.

537
00:32:07,878 --> 00:32:11,922
You and you and
mostly me and you.

538
00:32:13,127 --> 00:32:15,133
I'm poverty's new sheriff

539
00:32:15,608 --> 00:32:18,221
and I'm bashing in the slums.

540
00:32:19,847 --> 00:32:28,833
A hero doesn't care if you're a
bunch of scary alcoholics bums.

541
00:32:28,986 --> 00:32:30,203
Everybody !

542
00:32:30,397 --> 00:32:34,580
Everyone's a hero
in their own way.

543
00:32:35,378 --> 00:32:39,713
Everyone can blaze
a hero's drill.

544
00:32:40,635 --> 00:32:42,751
Don't worry if it's hard.

545
00:32:43,018 --> 00:32:48,163
If you're not afraid and
tard you will prevail.

546
00:32:48,436 --> 00:32:53,433
Everyone's a hero
in their own way.

547
00:32:53,798 --> 00:32:57,380
Everyone's a hero in their...

548
00:33:07,648 --> 00:33:08,830
Look at these people.

549
00:33:08,968 --> 00:33:13,092
Amazing how sheep will
show up for the slaughter.

550
00:33:13,716 --> 00:33:19,152
No one condemming you, lined up
like lemmings you led to the water.

551
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:22,263
Why can't they see what I see ?

552
00:33:22,438 --> 00:33:25,471
Why can't they hear the lies ?

553
00:33:25,826 --> 00:33:30,480
Maybe the fee's too pricy
for them to realize,

554
00:33:30,665 --> 00:33:33,893
your disguise is slippy.

555
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:37,092
I think you're slipping.

556
00:33:38,377 --> 00:33:41,132
Now that your saviour
is still as the grave

557
00:33:41,256 --> 00:33:44,053
you're beginning to fear me

558
00:33:44,376 --> 00:33:47,092
like cavemen fear thunder
I still have to wonder

559
00:33:47,297 --> 00:33:49,851
can you really hear me ?

560
00:33:50,608 --> 00:33:56,112
I bring you pain,
the kind you can't suffer quietly.

561
00:33:56,565 --> 00:33:58,043
Fire up your brain,

562
00:33:58,218 --> 00:34:05,030
remind you inside your
rioting society is slipping.

563
00:34:05,325 --> 00:34:09,541
Everything's slipping
away so...

564
00:34:09,868 --> 00:34:12,561
go ahead, run away,
say it was horrible,

565
00:34:12,726 --> 00:34:15,560
spread the word, tell your friends,
tell 'em the tale,

566
00:34:15,717 --> 00:34:18,463
get a picture, do a blog.
Heroes are over with.

567
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:21,332
Look at him ! Not a word !
Hammer me nail.

568
00:34:21,598 --> 00:34:24,271
Then I win,
then I get everything I ever...

569
00:34:24,415 --> 00:34:27,100
All the cash,
all the fame and social change.

570
00:34:27,258 --> 00:34:31,081
Anarchy... that I run.
It's Dr. Horrible's turn.

571
00:34:31,568 --> 00:34:34,273
You people all have to learn.

572
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:37,031
This world is going to burn.

573
00:34:37,246 --> 00:34:42,742
Burn ! Yeah, it's 2 "r".
H-O-R-R... Burn !

574
00:34:45,328 --> 00:34:51,161
No sign of Penny. Good, I would
give anything not to have her see.

575
00:34:52,347 --> 00:34:55,570
It's gonna be bloody.
Head up, Billy buddy.

576
00:34:55,768 --> 00:34:57,952
There's no time for mercy.

577
00:34:58,937 --> 00:35:02,490
Here goes no mercy.

578
00:35:07,575 --> 00:35:10,651
That's not a good sound.

579
00:35:21,136 --> 00:35:24,970
Why ?

580
00:35:26,378 --> 00:35:27,780
A death ray !

581
00:35:28,385 --> 00:35:30,603
Looks like Dr.
Horrible's moving up !

582
00:35:31,257 --> 00:35:33,973
Let's see if this one works
any better than your others.

583
00:35:34,557 --> 00:35:35,353
Don't !

584
00:35:35,537 --> 00:35:36,972
I don't have time
for your warnings.

585
00:35:37,045 --> 00:35:38,603
You give my regards
to Saint Peter

586
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,681
or whoever has his
job but in hell.

587
00:35:53,966 --> 00:35:55,812
Oh, I'm in pain !

588
00:35:56,505 --> 00:35:59,012
I think this is what
pain feels like.

589
00:35:59,776 --> 00:36:03,852
Oh, mother !
Someone make it stop !

590
00:36:04,046 --> 00:36:05,240
Get out of my way !

591
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:07,293
I gotta get out.

592
00:36:23,235 --> 00:36:24,733
Penny ! Penny !

593
00:36:25,545 --> 00:36:26,520
Penny !

594
00:36:28,796 --> 00:36:29,703
Billy ?

595
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:31,773
Is that you ?

596
00:36:31,966 --> 00:36:34,713
Penny, hold on. Oh no.
No, no, no, no !

597
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:36,891
- Are you alright ?
- Hold on.

598
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:39,360
It's okay. It's okay.

599
00:36:42,766 --> 00:36:45,683
Captain Hammer would say that.

600
00:36:50,998 --> 00:36:51,791
Penny !

601
00:36:53,758 --> 00:36:54,982
Penny...

602
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:05,700
Dr. Horrible !

603
00:37:05,936 --> 00:37:07,590
Why did you kill her ?
Dr. Horrible !

604
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:19,960
Here lies everything,

605
00:37:20,718 --> 00:37:26,390
the world I wanted at my feet.

606
00:37:26,546 --> 00:37:30,121
My victory's complete.

607
00:37:30,637 --> 00:37:34,470
So hail to the king.

608
00:37:40,137 --> 00:37:44,872
Arise and see.

609
00:37:47,085 --> 00:37:50,623
So your world's benine.

610
00:37:50,866 --> 00:37:56,400
So you think
justice has a voice

611
00:37:56,678 --> 00:38:00,460
and we all have a choice.

612
00:38:01,137 --> 00:38:05,551
Now your world is mine.

613
00:38:10,437 --> 00:38:15,631
And I am fine.

614
00:38:34,386 --> 00:38:38,402
...in my heart and it hurts...

615
00:39:18,176 --> 00:39:21,540
Now the nightmare's real.

616
00:39:21,848 --> 00:39:27,500
Now Dr. Horrible is here.

617
00:39:27,647 --> 00:39:31,640
To make you quake with fear.

618
00:39:31,868 --> 00:39:36,372
To make the whole world kneel.

619
00:39:41,425 --> 00:39:45,132
And I won't feel...

620
00:39:45,255 --> 00:39:47,651
a thing.

621
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:53,652
