1
00:01:32,482 --> 00:01:37,903
We begin on Christmas Eve with me,
Mark, and my roommate, Roger.

2
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:42,074
We live in an industrial loft on the
corner of 11th Street and Avenue B.

3
00:01:42,242 --> 00:01:46,787
It's the top floor of what was once
a music-publishing factory.

4
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:49,706
Old rock 'n' roll posters
hang on the walls.

5
00:01:49,874 --> 00:01:52,501
They have Roger's picture
advertising gigs...

6
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:56,088
...at CBGB's and the Pyramid Club.

7
00:01:56,256 --> 00:01:59,883
We have an illegal
wood-burning stove.

8
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:02,886
Its exhaust pipe crawls up
to a skylight.

9
00:02:03,054 --> 00:02:05,347
All of our electrical appliances
are plugged...

10
00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:10,978
...into one thick extension cord
which snakes its way out a window.

11
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:16,608
Outside, a small tent city has sprung
up in the lot next to our building.

12
00:02:16,776 --> 00:02:20,946
Inside, it's freezing
because we have no heat.

13
00:02:21,614 --> 00:02:23,282
Smile!

14
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:27,911
December 24th, 9 p. m.
Eastern Standard Time

15
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:31,665
From here on in,
I shoot without a script

16
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:35,878
See if anything comes of it
Instead of my old shit

17
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:37,296
First shot Roger

18
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:40,090
Tuning the Fender guitar
He hasn't played in a year

19
00:02:40,258 --> 00:02:42,926
- This won't tune
- So we hear

20
00:02:43,094 --> 00:02:46,471
He's just coming back
From half a year of withdrawal

21
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,017
- You talking to me?
- Not at all

22
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:54,229
Are you ready?
Hold that focus steady

23
00:02:54,397 --> 00:02:57,816
Tell the folks at home
What you're doing, Roger

24
00:02:57,984 --> 00:02:59,109
I'm writing one great-

25
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:00,944
- The phone rings
- Saved

26
00:03:01,112 --> 00:03:05,782
Re-screen
Zoom in on the answering machine

27
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,826
- Speak.
- Speak.

28
00:03:07,994 --> 00:03:11,538
That was a very loud beep
I don't even know if this is working

29
00:03:11,706 --> 00:03:12,956
Mark? Mark? Are you there?

30
00:03:13,124 --> 00:03:15,959
Are you screening your calls?
It's Mom

31
00:03:16,127 --> 00:03:18,337
We wanted to call
And say we love you

32
00:03:18,504 --> 00:03:20,339
And we'll miss you tomorrow

33
00:03:20,506 --> 00:03:22,966
Cindy and the kids are here
Send their love

34
00:03:23,134 --> 00:03:25,135
Oh, I hope you like the hot plate

35
00:03:25,303 --> 00:03:28,513
Just don't leave it on, dear
When you leave the house

36
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:29,723
Oh, and Mark

37
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:32,142
We're sorry to hear
That Maureen dumped you

38
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,564
I say c'est la vie
So let her be a lesbian

39
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:42,903
There are other fishies in the sea
Love, Mom

40
00:03:43,071 --> 00:03:46,114
Tell the folks at home
What you're doing, Roger

41
00:03:46,282 --> 00:03:49,660
- I'm writing one great song
- The phone rings

42
00:03:49,827 --> 00:03:51,119
We screen

43
00:03:51,287 --> 00:03:52,496
- Speak.
- Speak.

44
00:03:52,997 --> 00:03:55,165
- Chestnuts roasting
- Collins

45
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,000
- I'm downstairs
- Hey

46
00:03:57,168 --> 00:03:58,335
Roger picked up the phone?

47
00:03:58,503 --> 00:04:01,046
- No, it's me
- Throw down the key

48
00:04:01,214 --> 00:04:04,716
A wild night is now preordained

49
00:04:04,884 --> 00:04:06,176
I may be detained

50
00:04:08,012 --> 00:04:09,596
What does he mean?

51
00:04:09,764 --> 00:04:11,348
What do you mean, detained?

52
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,433
- Benny. Shit.
- Shit.

53
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:15,352
- Dudes, I'm on my way
- Great, fuck

54
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,229
- I need the rent
- What rent?

55
00:04:17,397 --> 00:04:19,189
- This past year's rent, which I let slide.
- Let slide?

56
00:04:19,357 --> 00:04:21,066
You said we were golden.

57
00:04:21,234 --> 00:04:23,694
- When you bought the building
- When we were roommates

58
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:27,155
- Remember, you lived here?
- How could I forget?

59
00:04:27,323 --> 00:04:29,199
You, me, Collins and Maureen.

60
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:30,701
How is the drama queen?

61
00:04:30,868 --> 00:04:32,077
She's performing tonight.

62
00:04:32,245 --> 00:04:34,788
I know.
Still a production manager?

63
00:04:34,956 --> 00:04:36,957
Two days ago, I was bumped.

64
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,377
- You still dating her?
- Last month, I was dumped

65
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:42,796
- She's in love
- Oh, she's got a new man?

66
00:04:42,964 --> 00:04:44,589
- Well, no-
- What's his name?

67
00:04:44,757 --> 00:04:46,383
- Joanne.
- Joanne.

68
00:04:47,427 --> 00:04:52,055
Rent, my amigos, is due,
or I will have to evict you.

69
00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:53,974
Be there in a few.

70
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:06,570
The power blows.

71
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,418
How do you document real life

72
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:25,922
When real life's getting more
Like fiction each day?

73
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,675
Headlines, bread lines
Blow my mind

74
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:32,929
And now this deadline
Eviction or pay

75
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:35,724
Rent

76
00:05:35,892 --> 00:05:39,144
How do you write a song
When the chords sound wrong?

77
00:05:39,312 --> 00:05:43,106
Though they once sounded
Right and rare

78
00:05:43,274 --> 00:05:46,109
When the notes are sour
Where is the power

79
00:05:46,277 --> 00:05:49,821
You once had to ignite the air?

80
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:52,491
- We're hungry and frozen
- Some life we've chosen

81
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:55,160
- How we gonna pay?
- How we gonna pay?

82
00:05:55,328 --> 00:05:58,121
- How we gonna pay?
- How we gonna pay?

83
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:00,499
- How we gonna pay
- How we gonna pay

84
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:04,795
- Last year's rent?
- Last year's rent?

85
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:06,713
We light candles.

86
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:14,763
How do you start a fire
When there's nothing to burn

87
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:18,850
And it feels like something's stuck
In your flue?

88
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:22,854
How can you generate heat
When you can't feel your feet

89
00:06:23,022 --> 00:06:25,357
- And they're turning blue?
- And they're turning blue?

90
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:26,942
You light up a mean blaze

91
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,527
- With posters
- And screenplays

92
00:06:28,694 --> 00:06:31,196
- How we gonna pay?
- How we gonna pay?

93
00:06:31,364 --> 00:06:33,657
- How we gonna pay?
- How we gonna pay?

94
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:36,243
- How we gonna pay
- How we gonna pay

95
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:40,205
- Last year's rent?
- Last year's rent?

96
00:06:40,373 --> 00:06:41,832
Don't screen, Maureen, it's me.

97
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:44,084
Joanne, your substitute
production manager.

98
00:06:44,252 --> 00:06:46,169
Hey, hey, hey. Did you eat?

99
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:47,879
Don't change the subject, Maureen

100
00:06:48,047 --> 00:06:50,757
But, darling,
You haven't eaten all day

101
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:53,176
You won't throw up
You won't throw up

102
00:06:53,344 --> 00:06:56,096
The digital delay
didn't blow up, exactly.

103
00:06:56,264 --> 00:06:59,015
There may have been one teeny,
tiny spark.

104
00:06:59,183 --> 00:07:01,351
You're not calling Mark.

105
00:07:01,811 --> 00:07:03,895
How do you stay on your feet

106
00:07:04,063 --> 00:07:06,148
When on every street
It's trick or treat

107
00:07:06,315 --> 00:07:09,401
And tonight it's trick?

108
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,945
Welcome back to town
I should lie down

109
00:07:12,113 --> 00:07:15,866
Everything's brown
And, uh-oh, I feel sick

110
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:18,743
- Where is he?
- Getting dizzy

111
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:21,037
- How we gonna pay?
- How we gonna pay?

112
00:07:21,205 --> 00:07:23,748
How we gonna pay?

113
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,626
How we gonna pay

114
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:30,589
Last year's rent?

115
00:07:41,434 --> 00:07:43,727
Allison, baby
You sound sad

116
00:07:43,895 --> 00:07:46,563
I can't believe those two
After everything I've done

117
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:48,815
Ever since our wedding, I'm dirt
They'll see

118
00:07:48,983 --> 00:07:51,735
I can help them all out
In the long run

119
00:07:52,528 --> 00:07:54,404
The music ignites the night

120
00:07:54,572 --> 00:07:57,407
- With passionate fire
- Maureen, I'm not a theater person.

121
00:07:57,575 --> 00:08:01,411
The narration crackles and pops
With incendiary wit

122
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:03,079
Could never be a theater person.

123
00:08:03,247 --> 00:08:05,582
Zoom in as they burn the past
To the ground

124
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,293
And feel the heat
Of the future's glow

125
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:10,420
Hello. Maureen.

126
00:08:10,588 --> 00:08:13,465
Your equipment won't work?
Okay, all right, I'll go.

127
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:16,593
How do you leave the past behind

128
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:21,181
When it keeps finding ways
To get to your heart?

129
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:24,768
It reaches way down deep
And tears you inside out

130
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:27,854
Till you're torn apart
Rent

131
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,400
How can you connect in an age
Where strangers, landlords, lovers

132
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:35,820
Your own blood cells betray?

133
00:08:35,988 --> 00:08:37,781
What binds the fabric together

134
00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:43,370
When the raging, shifting winds
Of change keep ripping away?

135
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:46,122
Draw a line in the sand
And then make a stand

136
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,792
- Use your camera to spar
- Use your guitar

137
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,670
When they act tough
You call their bluff

138
00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:54,339
We're not gonna pay

139
00:08:54,507 --> 00:08:56,800
We're not gonna pay

140
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:59,636
We're not gonna pay

141
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:02,347
Last year's rent

142
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:04,849
This year's rent

143
00:09:05,017 --> 00:09:07,394
Next year's rent

144
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:10,355
Rent, rent, rent, rent, rent

145
00:09:10,523 --> 00:09:12,899
We're not gonna pay rent

146
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:20,073
'Cause everything is rent

147
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:52,689
Christmas bells are ringing
Christmas bells are ringing

148
00:09:53,232 --> 00:09:56,234
Christmas bells are ringing

149
00:09:56,402 --> 00:10:00,739
Somewhere else, not here

150
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,585
You okay, honey?

151
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:16,254
I'm afraid so

152
00:10:16,422 --> 00:10:18,715
They get any money?

153
00:10:18,883 --> 00:10:22,677
No, had none to get

154
00:10:22,845 --> 00:10:25,889
But they purloined my coat

155
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:30,727
Well, you missed a sleeve

156
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:35,899
- Thanks
- Hell, it's Christmas Eve

157
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:38,610
I'm Angel

158
00:10:38,778 --> 00:10:42,405
Angel

159
00:10:43,115 --> 00:10:45,450
Indeed.

160
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:50,163
An angel of the first degree

161
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:51,539
Friends call me Collins.

162
00:10:51,707 --> 00:10:53,750
Tom Collins.

163
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:56,670
Nice tree

164
00:10:56,837 --> 00:10:59,631
Let's get a Band-Aid for your knee
I'll change it

165
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,883
There's a Life Support meeting
At 9:30

166
00:11:02,051 --> 00:11:05,428
Yes, this body
Provides a comfortable home

167
00:11:05,596 --> 00:11:08,431
For the Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome

168
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:11,518
- As does mine
- Oh, well, you look fine

169
00:11:11,686 --> 00:11:14,270
Get you a coat
Have a bite and make a night

170
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:16,398
- I'm flush
- My friends are waiting

171
00:11:16,565 --> 00:11:18,858
You're cute when you blush

172
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,696
The more, the merry
Ho, ho, ho

173
00:11:22,863 --> 00:11:25,865
And I do not take no

174
00:11:30,162 --> 00:11:33,039
- Where are you going?
- Maureen calls.

175
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:35,625
You're such a sucker.

176
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:39,295
I don't suppose you'd like to see
her show in the lot tonight...

177
00:11:39,463 --> 00:11:40,839
...or come to dinner?

178
00:11:41,006 --> 00:11:43,174
Zoom in on my empty wallet.

179
00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:44,884
Touché.

180
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:47,387
Take your AZT.

181
00:11:47,555 --> 00:11:48,930
Close on Roger

182
00:11:49,098 --> 00:11:53,601
His girlfriend April left a note
Saying, "We've got AIDS"

183
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:57,564
Before slitting her wrists
In the bathroom

184
00:11:58,482 --> 00:11:59,941
I'll check up on you later.

185
00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:03,695
If you change your mind...
You have to get out of the house.

186
00:12:08,617 --> 00:12:15,623
I'm writing one great song
Before I...

187
00:12:26,594 --> 00:12:28,344
God.

188
00:12:43,027 --> 00:12:46,488
One song
Glory

189
00:12:46,655 --> 00:12:49,908
One song before I go

190
00:12:50,075 --> 00:12:55,455
Glory
One song to leave behind

191
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:58,458
Find one song

192
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:00,543
One last refrain

193
00:13:00,711 --> 00:13:05,882
Glory
From the pretty-boy front man

194
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:11,304
Who wasted opportunity

195
00:13:11,472 --> 00:13:14,641
One song
He had the world at his feet

196
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:19,854
Glory
In the eyes of a young girl

197
00:13:20,606 --> 00:13:23,566
A young girl

198
00:13:24,235 --> 00:13:26,361
Find glory

199
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:28,571
Beyond the cheap colored lights

200
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:32,158
One song
Before the sun sets

201
00:13:32,326 --> 00:13:33,868
Glory

202
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:39,582
On another empty life

203
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,044
Time flies

204
00:13:43,212 --> 00:13:48,758
Time dies

205
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:52,345
Glory

206
00:13:54,849 --> 00:14:01,604
One blaze of glory

207
00:14:01,772 --> 00:14:08,778
One blaze of glory

208
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:15,326
Glory

209
00:14:16,495 --> 00:14:19,122
Find glory

210
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:25,128
In a song that rings true
Truth like a blazing fire

211
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:28,715
An eternal flame

212
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:33,303
Find one song

213
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,389
A song about love
Glory

214
00:14:36,557 --> 00:14:40,643
From the soul of a young man

215
00:14:41,478 --> 00:14:44,355
A young man

216
00:14:44,523 --> 00:14:49,444
Find the one song
Before the virus takes hold

217
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:52,655
Glory
Like a sunset

218
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:59,829
One song
To redeem this empty life

219
00:14:59,997 --> 00:15:03,499
Time flies

220
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:07,587
And then no need
To endure anymore

221
00:15:07,755 --> 00:15:11,591
Time dies

222
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,180
The door.

223
00:15:21,143 --> 00:15:24,187
- What'd you forget?
- Got a light?

224
00:15:24,355 --> 00:15:27,231
I know you, you're-

225
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,816
You're shivering

226
00:15:28,984 --> 00:15:32,153
It's nothing
They turned off my heat

227
00:15:32,321 --> 00:15:39,327
And I'm just a little weak on my feet
Would you light my candle?

228
00:15:41,747 --> 00:15:44,415
- What are you staring at?
- Nothing

229
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:48,169
Your hair in the moonlight

230
00:15:48,504 --> 00:15:51,506
You look familiar

231
00:15:52,758 --> 00:15:56,886
- Can you make it?
- Just haven't eaten much today

232
00:15:57,054 --> 00:16:00,723
At least the room
Stopped spinning anyway

233
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:02,809
- What?
- Nothing

234
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:07,313
- Your smile reminded me of-
- I always "remind people of"

235
00:16:07,481 --> 00:16:09,440
- Who is she?
- She died

236
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:13,569
- Her name was April
- It's out again

237
00:16:14,363 --> 00:16:21,369
Sorry 'bout your friend
Would you light my candle?

238
00:16:22,663 --> 00:16:24,247
- Well?
- Yeah?

239
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:28,584
Oh, the wax

240
00:16:28,752 --> 00:16:30,712
- It's-
- Dripping

241
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:33,715
- I like it between my-
- Fingers

242
00:16:33,882 --> 00:16:35,258
I figured

243
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:38,261
Oh, well, good night

244
00:16:45,936 --> 00:16:50,440
- It blew out again?
- No, I think that I dropped my stash

245
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:53,568
I know I've seen you out and about

246
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:55,987
When I used to go out

247
00:16:56,155 --> 00:16:57,780
Your candle's out

248
00:16:58,282 --> 00:17:01,784
I'm illin'
I had it when I walked in the door

249
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:05,830
It was pure
Is it on the floor?

250
00:17:05,998 --> 00:17:07,040
The floor?

251
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:11,627
They say that I have the best ass
Below 14th Street

252
00:17:11,795 --> 00:17:13,504
- Is it true?
- What?

253
00:17:14,173 --> 00:17:16,883
- You're staring again
- Oh, no

254
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:19,260
I mean, you do have a nice-

255
00:17:19,553 --> 00:17:21,679
I mean, you look familiar

256
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:24,974
- Like your dead girlfriend
- Only when you smile

257
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:27,769
But I'm sure I've seen you
Somewhere else

258
00:17:27,936 --> 00:17:32,148
Do you go to the Cat Scratch Club?
That's where I work

259
00:17:32,316 --> 00:17:34,025
I dance
Help me look

260
00:17:34,193 --> 00:17:37,070
Yes
They used to tie you up

261
00:17:37,237 --> 00:17:38,738
It's a living

262
00:17:38,906 --> 00:17:42,200
I didn't recognize you
Without the handcuffs

263
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:48,414
We could light the candle

264
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:55,838
Oh, won't you light the candle?

265
00:17:57,508 --> 00:18:00,134
Why don't you forget that stuff?

266
00:18:00,302 --> 00:18:04,097
- You look like you're 16
- I'm 19

267
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:08,392
But I'm old for my age
I'm just born to be bad

268
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,815
I once was born to be bad
I used to shiver like that

269
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:16,567
- I have no heat, I told you
- I used to sweat

270
00:18:16,735 --> 00:18:19,779
- I got a cold
- Uh-huh, I used to be a junkie

271
00:18:19,947 --> 00:18:22,865
- But now and then I like to feel good
- Uh-huh

272
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:24,325
- Oh, here
- What's that?

273
00:18:24,493 --> 00:18:26,494
Candy-bar wrapper.

274
00:18:26,662 --> 00:18:33,042
We could light the candle

275
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:40,133
Oh, what'd you do to my candle?

276
00:18:42,803 --> 00:18:46,722
- That was my last match
- Our eyes'll adjust

277
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:51,894
- Thank God for the moon
- Maybe it's not the moon at all

278
00:18:52,062 --> 00:18:54,939
I hear Spike Lee's shootin'
Down the street

279
00:18:55,107 --> 00:18:57,608
Bah humbug

280
00:18:58,902 --> 00:19:01,195
Bah humbug

281
00:19:01,363 --> 00:19:04,574
- Cold hands
- Yours too

282
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:08,286
Big
Like my father's

283
00:19:08,912 --> 00:19:10,371
Do you wanna dance?

284
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:11,998
With you?

285
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:17,753
- No, with my father
- I'm Roger

286
00:19:17,921 --> 00:19:19,422
They call me

287
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:24,802
They call me Mimi

288
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:40,776
Hi, you've reached Maureen
and Joanne. Leave a message.

289
00:19:40,944 --> 00:19:43,112
Don't forget "Over the Moon,"
my performance...

290
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,364
...protesting the eviction of the
homeless and artists...

291
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:48,534
...from the 11th Street lot tonight
at midnight, between A and B.

292
00:19:48,702 --> 00:19:51,287
Party at Life Cafe to follow.

293
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:54,624
Well, Joanne, we're off
I tried you at the office

294
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:58,252
And they said you were
Stage managing or something

295
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,339
Remind her that those unwed
mothers in Harlem need her help too.

296
00:20:01,506 --> 00:20:04,508
Call Daisy for our itinerary
Or Alfred at Pound Ridge

297
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:06,802
Or Eileen at the State Department
In a pinch

298
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,599
We'll be at the spa for New Year's
Unless the senator changes his mind

299
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:13,142
- The hearings
- Oh, yes, kitten

300
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,811
Mommy's confirmation hearings
Begin on the 10th

301
00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:18,105
We'll need you alone
By the 6th

302
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:19,398
- Harold!
- You hear that?

303
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:21,817
Just three weeks away
And she's already nervous

304
00:20:21,985 --> 00:20:24,320
- I am not
- For Mommy's sake, kitten

305
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:29,575
No Doc Martens this time
And wear a dress, oh, and Kitten

306
00:20:29,743 --> 00:20:35,248
- Have a merry
- And a bra

307
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,500
Enter Tom Collins.

308
00:20:37,668 --> 00:20:41,170
Computer genius, teacher,
vagabond anarchist...

309
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:44,715
...who ran naked
through the Parthenon.

310
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:51,681
Bustelo, Marlboro
Banana by the bunch

311
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:55,518
A box of Cap'n Crunch
Will taste so good

312
00:20:55,686 --> 00:20:59,397
- And firewood
- Look, it's Santa Claus

313
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,191
- Hold your applause
- Oh, hi

314
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,819
- "Oh, hi," after seven months?
- Sorry

315
00:21:04,987 --> 00:21:07,196
This boy could use some Stoli

316
00:21:07,364 --> 00:21:10,074
Oh, holy night

317
00:21:10,242 --> 00:21:13,744
You struck gold at MIT

318
00:21:13,912 --> 00:21:17,373
They expelled me for my theory
of actual reality...

319
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:21,711
...which I'll soon impart to the couch
potatoes at New York University.

320
00:21:21,878 --> 00:21:25,256
- Still haven't left the house?
- I was waiting for you, don't you know?

321
00:21:25,424 --> 00:21:28,676
Well, tonight's the night. Come to
the Life Cafe after Maureen's show.

322
00:21:28,844 --> 00:21:29,885
No flow.

323
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:33,306
Gentlemen, our benefactor
On this Christmas Eve

324
00:21:33,473 --> 00:21:38,144
Whose charity is only matched
By talent, I believe

325
00:21:38,312 --> 00:21:42,898
A new member of the Alphabet City
Avant-garde

326
00:21:43,275 --> 00:21:50,239
Angel Dumott Schunard

327
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,501
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

328
00:22:06,173 --> 00:22:09,008
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

329
00:22:09,176 --> 00:22:12,678
- And you should hear her beat
- You earned this on the street?

330
00:22:12,846 --> 00:22:16,265
It was my lucky day today
On Avenue A

331
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:20,102
When a lady in a limousine
Drove my way

332
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:23,606
She said, "Darling, be a dear
Haven't slept in a year

333
00:22:23,815 --> 00:22:27,443
I need your help to make my
Neighbor's yappy dog disappear

334
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:33,699
This Akita, Evita, just won't shut up
I believe if you play nonstop

335
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:38,454
That pup will breathe its very last
High-strung breath

336
00:22:38,622 --> 00:22:42,333
I'm certain that cur
Will bark itself to death"

337
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:45,711
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

338
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:49,340
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

339
00:22:49,508 --> 00:22:53,719
We agreed on a fee
$1000 guarantee, tax free

340
00:22:53,887 --> 00:22:56,180
And a bonus if I trim her tree

341
00:22:56,765 --> 00:23:00,309
Now, who could foretell
That it would go so well?

342
00:23:00,477 --> 00:23:03,813
But sure as I am here
That dog is now in doggy hell

343
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,525
After an hour, Evita, in all her glory

344
00:23:07,692 --> 00:23:11,529
From a window ledge
Of that 23rd story

345
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:14,740
Like Thelma and Louise did
When they got the blues

346
00:23:14,908 --> 00:23:18,327
Swan-dove into the courtyard
Of the Gracie Mews

347
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:22,206
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

348
00:23:22,374 --> 00:23:26,043
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

349
00:23:30,674 --> 00:23:32,508
You go, girl.

350
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,519
Back on the street
Where I met my sweet

351
00:23:43,687 --> 00:23:47,690
Where he was moaning and groaning
On the cold concrete

352
00:23:47,858 --> 00:23:51,235
The nurse took him home
For some Mercurochrome

353
00:23:51,403 --> 00:23:54,363
Then I dressed his wounds
And got him back on his feet

354
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:56,407
Sing it
Today for you

355
00:23:56,575 --> 00:23:58,534
Tomorrow for me

356
00:23:58,702 --> 00:24:01,620
Today for you
Tomorrow for me

357
00:24:01,788 --> 00:24:04,290
I said
Today for you

358
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:07,209
Tomorrow for me
Today for you

359
00:24:07,544 --> 00:24:12,214
Tomorrow

360
00:24:12,757 --> 00:24:14,508
For me

361
00:24:21,057 --> 00:24:23,642
Joy to the world

362
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,145
Hey. You bum. Yeah, you.
Move over.

363
00:24:26,313 --> 00:24:28,314
Get your ass off that Range Rover.

364
00:24:28,482 --> 00:24:30,191
That attitude toward the homeless...

365
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:32,902
...is exactly what Maureen
is protesting tonight.

366
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,572
Close-up: Our ex-roommate,
Benjamin Coffin III...

367
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,575
...who married Allison Grey
of the Westport Greys...

368
00:24:39,743 --> 00:24:41,535
...then bought our building
and the lot next door...

369
00:24:41,703 --> 00:24:45,247
...from his father-in-law,
in hopes of starting a cyber-studio.

370
00:24:45,415 --> 00:24:49,585
Maureen is protesting
Losing her performance space

371
00:24:49,753 --> 00:24:52,296
Not my attitude

372
00:24:54,132 --> 00:24:56,258
What happened to Benny?

373
00:24:56,426 --> 00:25:01,972
What happened to his heart
And the ideals he once pursued?

374
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:04,600
Any owner of that lot next door

375
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:09,271
Has the right to do with it
As he pleases

376
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:11,357
Happy birthday, Jesus

377
00:25:11,525 --> 00:25:13,108
- The rent
- You're wasting your time

378
00:25:13,276 --> 00:25:15,778
- We're broke
- You broke your word, this is absurd

379
00:25:15,946 --> 00:25:18,781
There is one way
You won't have to pay

380
00:25:18,949 --> 00:25:19,949
I knew it.

381
00:25:20,116 --> 00:25:21,575
Next door, the home of CyberArts

382
00:25:21,743 --> 00:25:27,414
And now that the block is rezoned
Our dream can become a reality

383
00:25:27,582 --> 00:25:31,585
You'll see, boys

384
00:25:31,753 --> 00:25:35,130
You'll see, boys

385
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:40,344
A state-of-the-art, digital
Virtual interactive studio

386
00:25:40,512 --> 00:25:44,306
I'll forgo your rent
And on paper guarantee

387
00:25:44,474 --> 00:25:47,017
That you can stay here for free

388
00:25:47,185 --> 00:25:49,019
- If you do me one small favor.
- What?

389
00:25:49,187 --> 00:25:51,313
Convince Maureen
to cancel her protest.

390
00:25:51,481 --> 00:25:54,149
Why not just get an injunction
or call the cops?

391
00:25:54,317 --> 00:25:56,443
I did, and they're on standby.

392
00:25:56,611 --> 00:26:01,365
But my investors would rather
I handle this quietly

393
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:03,492
You can't wipe out
an entire tent city...

394
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,536
...then watch It's a Wonderful Life
on TV.

395
00:26:05,704 --> 00:26:07,705
You wanna produce films
and write songs?

396
00:26:07,872 --> 00:26:09,373
You need somewhere to do it

397
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:13,168
It's what we used to dream about
Think twice before you pooh-pooh it

398
00:26:13,336 --> 00:26:17,381
You'll see, boys

399
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:21,427
You'll see, boys

400
00:26:21,595 --> 00:26:25,931
You'll see the beauty of a studio

401
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:30,144
That lets us do our work
And get paid

402
00:26:30,312 --> 00:26:34,273
With condos on the top
Whose rent keeps open our shop

403
00:26:34,441 --> 00:26:38,152
Just stop the protest
And you'll have it made

404
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,529
You'll see

405
00:26:40,697 --> 00:26:41,864
Or you'll pack.

406
00:26:42,032 --> 00:26:44,033
That boy could use some Prozac.

407
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,868
- Or heavy drugs.
- Or group hugs.

408
00:26:46,036 --> 00:26:48,662
Which reminds me,
we have a detour to make tonight.

409
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,206
Anyone who wants to
can come along.

410
00:26:51,374 --> 00:26:53,792
Life Support's a group for people
coping with life.

411
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,419
We don't have to stay too long.

412
00:26:55,587 --> 00:26:57,421
First I've got a protest to save

413
00:26:57,589 --> 00:26:59,465
- Pleasure.
- I'm not much company.

414
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:01,050
- Behave.
- He'll catch up later.

415
00:27:01,217 --> 00:27:03,218
He's just got other things
on his mind.

416
00:27:03,386 --> 00:27:07,348
We'll see, boys

417
00:27:07,515 --> 00:27:11,727
We'll see, boys

418
00:27:11,895 --> 00:27:15,648
Let it be, boys

419
00:27:15,815 --> 00:27:19,735
- I like boys
- Boys like me

420
00:27:19,903 --> 00:27:24,782
We'll see

421
00:27:28,078 --> 00:27:30,079
And so, into the abyss

422
00:27:30,246 --> 00:27:33,624
The lot, where a small stage
is partially set up.

423
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:36,377
Line in.
I went to Harvard for this?

424
00:27:36,544 --> 00:27:38,462
- Close on Mark's nose dive.
- Line out.

425
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,632
Will he get out of here alive?

426
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,676
- Mark?
- Hi.

427
00:27:43,843 --> 00:27:46,178
I told her not to call you

428
00:27:46,346 --> 00:27:49,431
That's Maureen, but can I help
Since I'm here?

429
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:53,435
I've hired an engineer.

430
00:27:55,146 --> 00:27:56,605
Great.

431
00:27:56,773 --> 00:27:58,524
So nice to have met you.

432
00:27:58,692 --> 00:28:00,442
Wait.

433
00:28:02,237 --> 00:28:04,154
She's three hours late.

434
00:28:07,575 --> 00:28:10,536
The samples won't delay
But the cable-

435
00:28:10,704 --> 00:28:13,288
There's another way
Say something, anything

436
00:28:13,456 --> 00:28:15,624
Test, one, two, three

437
00:28:16,292 --> 00:28:18,544
Anything but that

438
00:28:20,547 --> 00:28:22,172
- This is weird
- It's weird

439
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,091
- Very weird
- Fuckin' weird

440
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:27,386
I'm so mad that
I don't know what to do

441
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:31,640
Fighting with microphones
Freezing down to my bones

442
00:28:31,808 --> 00:28:34,977
And to top it all off
I'm with you

443
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,148
Feel like going insane?
Got a fire in your brain?

444
00:28:39,315 --> 00:28:42,359
And you're thinking
Of drinking gasoline?

445
00:28:42,861 --> 00:28:46,780
- As a matter of fact
- Honey, I know this act

446
00:28:46,948 --> 00:28:50,159
It's called the Tango: Maureen

447
00:28:50,535 --> 00:28:54,121
The Tango: Maureen

448
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:57,708
It's a dark, dizzy merry-go-round

449
00:28:58,251 --> 00:29:01,628
- As she keeps you dangling
- You're wrong

450
00:29:01,796 --> 00:29:05,382
- Your heart she is mangling
- It's different with me

451
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,259
And you toss and you turn

452
00:29:07,427 --> 00:29:09,136
'Cause her cold eyes can burn

453
00:29:09,304 --> 00:29:12,431
Yet you yearn, and you churn
And rebound

454
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:15,851
I think I know what you mean

455
00:29:16,102 --> 00:29:20,355
- The Tango: Maureen
- The Tango: Maureen

456
00:29:20,774 --> 00:29:26,528
Has she ever pouted her lips
And called you "pookie"?

457
00:29:26,696 --> 00:29:27,946
Never.

458
00:29:28,114 --> 00:29:32,034
Have you ever
Doubted a kiss or two?

459
00:29:32,243 --> 00:29:34,369
This is spooky

460
00:29:35,705 --> 00:29:38,290
Did you swoon
When she walked through the door?

461
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,794
Every time, so be cautious

462
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:45,714
Did she moon over other boys?

463
00:29:45,882 --> 00:29:49,384
- More than moon
- I'm getting nauseous

464
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,582
Where'd you learn how to tango?

465
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:24,336
With the French ambassador's
daughter in her room at Miss Porter's.

466
00:30:24,504 --> 00:30:25,629
And you?

467
00:30:25,797 --> 00:30:28,006
With Nanette Himmelfarb,
the rabbi's daughter...

468
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:30,759
...at the Scarsdale Jewish
Community Center.

469
00:30:32,637 --> 00:30:34,805
It's hard to do this backwards.

470
00:30:34,973 --> 00:30:37,432
You should try it in heels.

471
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,976
- She cheated
- She cheated

472
00:30:39,143 --> 00:30:40,978
- Maureen cheated
- Fuckin' cheated

473
00:30:41,145 --> 00:30:44,690
I'm defeated
I should give up right now

474
00:30:44,858 --> 00:30:48,443
Gotta look on the bright side
With all of your might

475
00:30:48,611 --> 00:30:52,114
I'd fall for her still, anyhow

476
00:30:52,282 --> 00:30:56,243
When you're dancing her dance
You don't stand a chance

477
00:30:56,411 --> 00:30:59,746
Her grip of romance makes you fall

478
00:30:59,914 --> 00:31:03,542
- So you think, "Might as well"
- "Dance a tango to hell"

479
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:06,795
"At least I'll have tangoed at all"

480
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:10,632
The Tango: Maureen

481
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,678
Gotta dance till your diva is through

482
00:31:14,846 --> 00:31:18,140
You pretend to believe her

483
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:22,185
'Cause in the end
You can't leave her

484
00:31:22,353 --> 00:31:25,898
But the end, it will come
Still you have to play dumb

485
00:31:26,065 --> 00:31:28,984
Till you're glum and you bum
And turn blue

486
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:32,988
Why do we love when she's mean?

487
00:31:33,156 --> 00:31:36,658
And she can be so obscene

488
00:31:36,826 --> 00:31:38,118
Try the mike.

489
00:31:38,286 --> 00:31:40,746
My Maureen

490
00:31:40,914 --> 00:31:43,165
- Patched.
- Thanks.

491
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:46,501
You know, I feel great now.

492
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:49,838
I feel lousy.

493
00:31:54,886 --> 00:31:57,679
Hey, honey. We're- "Pookie"?

494
00:31:58,514 --> 00:32:00,724
You never called me "Pookie. "

495
00:32:04,687 --> 00:32:08,023
Forget it. We're patched.

496
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:15,656
The Tango: Maureen

497
00:32:27,585 --> 00:32:29,378
Steve.

498
00:32:29,796 --> 00:32:30,837
Gordon.

499
00:32:31,005 --> 00:32:32,047
Ali.

500
00:32:32,215 --> 00:32:33,966
- Pam.
- Lisa.

501
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:36,051
Hi. I'm Angel.

502
00:32:36,219 --> 00:32:38,095
Tom. Collins.

503
00:32:38,262 --> 00:32:40,514
I'm Paul. Let's begin.

504
00:32:41,891 --> 00:32:45,978
There's only us

505
00:32:46,145 --> 00:32:50,065
There's only this

506
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:51,775
Sorry. Excuse me.

507
00:32:51,943 --> 00:32:53,360
And you are...?

508
00:32:53,528 --> 00:32:57,781
Oh, I'm not- I'm just here-
I don't have- I'm here with...

509
00:32:57,949 --> 00:32:59,449
Mark

510
00:32:59,617 --> 00:33:02,452
Mark
I'm Mark.

511
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:06,081
Well, this is quite an operation

512
00:33:06,249 --> 00:33:07,249
Sit down, Mark.

513
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:09,835
We'll continue the affirmation.

514
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,755
Forget regret

515
00:33:13,965 --> 00:33:16,717
Or life is yours to miss

516
00:33:16,884 --> 00:33:19,469
Excuse me, Paul
I'm having a problem with this

517
00:33:19,637 --> 00:33:21,263
This credo

518
00:33:21,431 --> 00:33:24,599
My T-cells are low.
I regret that news, okay?

519
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:27,853
All right, but, Gordon
How do you feel today?

520
00:33:28,021 --> 00:33:30,605
- What do you mean?
- How do you feel today?

521
00:33:30,773 --> 00:33:32,315
- Okay.
- Is that all?

522
00:33:32,483 --> 00:33:35,944
- Best I've felt all year
- Then why choose fear?

523
00:33:36,112 --> 00:33:39,448
I'm a New Yorker
Fear's my life

524
00:33:42,285 --> 00:33:46,038
Look, I find
Some of what you teach suspect

525
00:33:46,205 --> 00:33:49,666
Because I'm used to
Relying on intellect

526
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:53,295
But I try to open up
To what I don't know

527
00:33:53,463 --> 00:33:58,050
Because reason says
I should have died

528
00:33:58,217 --> 00:34:02,679
Three years ago

529
00:34:02,847 --> 00:34:05,307
No other road

530
00:34:05,475 --> 00:34:08,810
No other way

531
00:34:09,228 --> 00:34:13,273
No day but today

532
00:34:26,496 --> 00:34:29,164
What's the time?

533
00:34:29,332 --> 00:34:32,375
Well, it's gotta be close to midnight

534
00:34:32,877 --> 00:34:38,215
My body's talking to me
It says, "Time for danger"

535
00:34:39,008 --> 00:34:42,260
It says, "I wanna commit a crime

536
00:34:42,428 --> 00:34:45,639
Wanna be the cause of a fight

537
00:34:45,807 --> 00:34:48,767
I wanna put on a tight skirt

538
00:34:48,935 --> 00:34:51,770
And flirt with a stranger"

539
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:56,399
I've had a knack from way back

540
00:34:56,609 --> 00:34:59,277
At breaking the rules
Once I learn the game

541
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:02,864
Get up, life's too quick
I know someplace sick

542
00:35:03,032 --> 00:35:06,827
Where this chick'll
Dance in the flames

543
00:35:06,994 --> 00:35:10,205
We don't need any money

544
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:13,375
I always get in for free

545
00:35:13,543 --> 00:35:15,710
You can get in too

546
00:35:15,878 --> 00:35:19,089
If you get in with me

547
00:35:19,257 --> 00:35:21,049
Let's go

548
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:25,262
Out tonight

549
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,014
I have to go

550
00:35:28,182 --> 00:35:32,102
Out tonight

551
00:35:34,355 --> 00:35:36,940
You wanna play?
Let's run away

552
00:35:37,108 --> 00:35:41,736
We won't be back
Before it's Christmas Day

553
00:35:41,904 --> 00:35:45,574
Take me out tonight

554
00:35:46,617 --> 00:35:47,993
Meow.

555
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,833
Yeah

556
00:35:55,001 --> 00:35:58,170
When I get a wink
From the doorman

557
00:35:58,337 --> 00:36:00,964
Do you know how lucky you'll be?

558
00:36:01,132 --> 00:36:03,091
That you're on the line

559
00:36:03,259 --> 00:36:07,304
With the feline of Avenue B

560
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:09,097
Let's go

561
00:36:09,265 --> 00:36:12,934
Out tonight

562
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,979
I have to go

563
00:36:16,147 --> 00:36:19,774
Out tonight

564
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,864
You wanna prowl?
Be my night owl?

565
00:36:26,032 --> 00:36:28,033
Well, take my hand, we're gonna

566
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:30,452
Howl

567
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:34,915
Out tonight

568
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:39,628
In the evening I gotta roam

569
00:36:39,795 --> 00:36:43,048
Can't sleep in the city
Of neon and chrome

570
00:36:43,216 --> 00:36:46,134
Feels too damn much like home

571
00:36:46,302 --> 00:36:50,013
When the Spanish babies cry

572
00:36:51,015 --> 00:36:53,058
So let's find a bar

573
00:36:53,226 --> 00:36:57,020
So dark we forget who we are

574
00:36:57,188 --> 00:37:03,068
Where all the scars
From the nevers and maybes die

575
00:37:03,236 --> 00:37:04,986
Let's go

576
00:37:05,154 --> 00:37:09,407
Out tonight

577
00:37:10,076 --> 00:37:11,952
I have to go

578
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:15,622
Out tonight

579
00:37:18,459 --> 00:37:21,002
You're sweet
Wanna hit the street?

580
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:24,422
Wanna wail at the moon
Like a cat in heat?

581
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,091
Just take me

582
00:37:26,634 --> 00:37:29,344
Out tonight

583
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,472
Please take me

584
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,309
Out tonight

585
00:37:37,353 --> 00:37:39,187
Don't forsake me

586
00:37:39,897 --> 00:37:43,942
Out tonight

587
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:47,362
I'll let you make me

588
00:37:47,613 --> 00:37:51,032
Out tonight

589
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,617
Tonight

590
00:37:52,785 --> 00:37:56,371
Tonight
Tonight

591
00:38:06,757 --> 00:38:09,759
Who do you think you are?

592
00:38:09,927 --> 00:38:13,013
Barging in on me and my guitar

593
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,765
Little girl, hey, the door is that way

594
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,893
You better go
You know the fire's out anyway

595
00:38:19,478 --> 00:38:22,063
Take your powder
Take your candle

596
00:38:22,231 --> 00:38:25,275
Your sweet whisper
I just can't handle

597
00:38:25,735 --> 00:38:28,111
Well, take your hair
In the moonlight

598
00:38:28,279 --> 00:38:34,242
Your brown eyes
Goodbye, good night

599
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:36,786
I should tell you
I should tell you

600
00:38:36,954 --> 00:38:39,080
I should tell you, I should-
No

601
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,916
Another time, another place

602
00:38:42,376 --> 00:38:45,754
Our temperature would climb
There'd be a long embrace

603
00:38:45,921 --> 00:38:49,132
We'd do another dance
It'd be another play

604
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,592
Looking for romance?

605
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,471
Come back another day

606
00:38:54,638 --> 00:38:58,933
Another day

607
00:38:59,101 --> 00:39:02,103
The heart may freeze

608
00:39:02,271 --> 00:39:05,690
Or it can burn

609
00:39:05,858 --> 00:39:08,651
The pain will ease

610
00:39:08,819 --> 00:39:11,988
If I can learn

611
00:39:12,156 --> 00:39:15,116
There is no future

612
00:39:15,284 --> 00:39:17,827
There is no past

613
00:39:17,995 --> 00:39:20,997
I live this moment as

614
00:39:21,165 --> 00:39:24,626
My last

615
00:39:24,794 --> 00:39:28,129
There's only us

616
00:39:28,297 --> 00:39:31,132
There's only this

617
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,344
Forget regret

618
00:39:34,512 --> 00:39:37,555
Or life is yours to miss

619
00:39:37,723 --> 00:39:41,059
No other road

620
00:39:41,227 --> 00:39:44,354
No other way

621
00:39:44,522 --> 00:39:49,484
No day but today

622
00:39:49,652 --> 00:39:52,237
Excuse me if I'm off track

623
00:39:52,405 --> 00:39:54,239
But if you're so wise
Then tell me

624
00:39:54,407 --> 00:39:55,990
Why do you need smack?

625
00:39:56,158 --> 00:39:57,534
Take your needle

626
00:39:57,701 --> 00:39:59,119
Take your fancy prayer

627
00:39:59,286 --> 00:40:02,414
Don't forget
Get the moonlight out of your hair

628
00:40:02,581 --> 00:40:04,999
Long ago you might have
Lit up my heart

629
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:10,672
But the fire's dead
Ain't never ever gonna start

630
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,716
Another time
Another place

631
00:40:13,884 --> 00:40:17,512
The words would only rhyme
We'd be in outer space

632
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,057
It'd be another song
We'd sing another way

633
00:40:21,225 --> 00:40:25,228
You wanna prove me wrong?
Come back another day

634
00:40:26,397 --> 00:40:30,942
Another day

635
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:34,487
There's only yes

636
00:40:34,655 --> 00:40:37,740
Only tonight

637
00:40:37,908 --> 00:40:41,035
We must let go

638
00:40:41,203 --> 00:40:43,705
To know what's right

639
00:40:43,873 --> 00:40:47,375
No other course

640
00:40:47,543 --> 00:40:50,545
No other way

641
00:40:50,713 --> 00:40:56,551
No day but today

642
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:00,054
I can't control

643
00:41:00,222 --> 00:41:02,891
Control your temper

644
00:41:03,058 --> 00:41:06,853
My destiny

645
00:41:07,021 --> 00:41:09,397
She doesn't see

646
00:41:09,565 --> 00:41:12,192
I trust my soul

647
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:16,029
- Who says that there's a soul?
- My only goal

648
00:41:16,197 --> 00:41:20,158
Is just to be

649
00:41:20,326 --> 00:41:21,910
Just let me be

650
00:41:22,077 --> 00:41:27,999
- Who do you think you are?
- There's only now, there's only here

651
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:34,255
- Barging in on me and my guitar
- Give in to love, or live in fear

652
00:41:34,423 --> 00:41:37,175
- Little girl, hey
- No other path

653
00:41:37,343 --> 00:41:41,179
- The door is that way
- No other way

654
00:41:41,347 --> 00:41:44,766
No day but today

655
00:41:44,934 --> 00:41:47,185
The fire's out anyway

656
00:41:47,353 --> 00:41:49,604
No day but today

657
00:41:49,772 --> 00:41:53,191
Take your powder
Take your candle

658
00:41:53,692 --> 00:41:56,152
No day but today

659
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,864
Take your brown eyes
Your pretty smile, your silhouette

660
00:42:00,032 --> 00:42:02,367
No day but today

661
00:42:02,535 --> 00:42:06,454
Another time, another place
Another rhyme, a warm embrace

662
00:42:06,622 --> 00:42:08,623
No day but today

663
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:11,751
Another dance
Another way, another chance

664
00:42:11,919 --> 00:42:14,546
Another day

665
00:42:14,713 --> 00:42:21,636
No day but today

666
00:42:34,024 --> 00:42:37,068
I'm writing one great song

667
00:42:38,612 --> 00:42:43,408
Before I...

668
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:55,336
Will I lose my dignity?

669
00:42:55,713 --> 00:43:01,426
Will someone care?

670
00:43:01,594 --> 00:43:05,096
Will I wake tomorrow

671
00:43:05,264 --> 00:43:11,853
From this nightmare?

672
00:43:12,021 --> 00:43:15,565
Will I lose my dignity?

673
00:43:16,233 --> 00:43:21,863
Will someone care?

674
00:43:22,364 --> 00:43:25,700
Will I wake tomorrow

675
00:43:25,868 --> 00:43:32,373
From this nightmare?

676
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:37,420
- Will I lose my dignity?
- Will I lose my dignity?

677
00:43:37,588 --> 00:43:40,089
Will someone care?

678
00:43:40,257 --> 00:43:42,967
Will someone care?

679
00:43:43,135 --> 00:43:47,430
- Will I wake tomorrow
- Will I wake tomorrow

680
00:43:47,598 --> 00:43:53,394
- From this nightmare?
- From this nightmare?

681
00:43:53,562 --> 00:43:57,440
- Will I lose my dignity?
- Will I lose my dignity?

682
00:43:57,608 --> 00:44:03,237
- Will someone care?
- Will I lose my dignity?

683
00:44:03,405 --> 00:44:07,575
- Will I wake tomorrow
- Will someone care?

684
00:44:07,743 --> 00:44:14,123
- From this nightmare?
- Will I wake tomorrow

685
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:18,169
- Will I lose my dignity?
- From this nightmare?

686
00:44:18,337 --> 00:44:20,004
Will I lose my dignity?

687
00:44:20,172 --> 00:44:24,258
- Will someone care?
- Will I lose my dignity?

688
00:44:24,426 --> 00:44:30,139
- Will I wake tomorrow
- Will someone care?

689
00:44:30,307 --> 00:44:37,313
- From this nightmare?
- Will I wake tomorrow?

690
00:44:52,538 --> 00:44:56,874
Christmas bells are ringing

691
00:44:57,042 --> 00:45:01,546
- Christmas bells are ringing
- Christmas bells are ringing

692
00:45:01,714 --> 00:45:06,134
Christmas bells are ringing

693
00:45:06,301 --> 00:45:11,222
Out of town
Santa Fe

694
00:45:14,518 --> 00:45:16,602
Honest living, man.

695
00:45:28,282 --> 00:45:30,158
Evening, officer.

696
00:45:30,325 --> 00:45:34,662
Smile for Ted Koppel,
Officer Martin.

697
00:45:35,914 --> 00:45:39,917
And a merry Christmas
To your family

698
00:45:40,085 --> 00:45:41,753
Right.

699
00:45:47,176 --> 00:45:52,972
Who the fuck do you think you are?
I don't need no goddamn help

700
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,974
From some
Bleeding heart cameraman

701
00:45:55,142 --> 00:46:00,354
My life's not for you
To make a name for yourself on

702
00:46:00,522 --> 00:46:04,650
Easy, sugar, easy
He was just trying to-

703
00:46:04,818 --> 00:46:07,737
Just trying to use me
To kill his guilt

704
00:46:07,905 --> 00:46:10,198
It's not that kind of movie, honey.

705
00:46:10,365 --> 00:46:15,369
Let's go. This line is full
of motherfucking artists.

706
00:46:17,623 --> 00:46:22,251
Hey. Artist. You got a dollar?

707
00:46:24,296 --> 00:46:26,547
Yeah, I thought not.

708
00:46:31,845 --> 00:46:34,013
New York City.

709
00:46:34,181 --> 00:46:35,264
Center of the universe

710
00:46:35,432 --> 00:46:36,641
Sing it, girl.

711
00:46:36,809 --> 00:46:39,727
Times are shitty, but I'm pretty sure
they can't get worse.

712
00:46:39,895 --> 00:46:41,103
I hear you.

713
00:46:41,271 --> 00:46:42,313
It's a comfort to know

714
00:46:42,481 --> 00:46:44,732
When you're singing
The hit-the-road blues

715
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:49,821
That anywhere else you could
Possibly go after New York would be

716
00:46:50,781 --> 00:46:52,240
A pleasure cruise

717
00:46:53,283 --> 00:46:55,993
Now you're talking.

718
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:59,539
Well, I'm thwarted by a
Metaphysic puzzle

719
00:47:00,624 --> 00:47:04,669
And I'm sick of grading papers
That I know

720
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:09,048
I'm shouting in my sleep
I need a muzzle

721
00:47:10,175 --> 00:47:13,302
All this misery pays no salary
So

722
00:47:14,304 --> 00:47:18,933
Let's open up a restaurant
In Santa Fe

723
00:47:19,101 --> 00:47:23,271
Sunny Santa Fe would be nice

724
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,984
We'll open up a restaurant
In Santa Fe

725
00:47:28,151 --> 00:47:32,947
And leave this
To the roaches and mice

726
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:50,464
- You teach?
- I teach.

727
00:47:50,632 --> 00:47:52,592
Computer Age Philosophy.

728
00:47:52,759 --> 00:47:55,344
But my students
would rather watch TV.

729
00:47:55,512 --> 00:47:57,805
- America.
- America.

730
00:47:57,973 --> 00:47:59,432
You're a sensitive aesthete

731
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,893
Brush the sauce onto the meat

732
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:06,314
You can make the menu
Sparkle with a rhyme

733
00:48:06,481 --> 00:48:08,399
You can drum a gentle drum

734
00:48:08,567 --> 00:48:10,818
And I can seat guests as they come

735
00:48:10,986 --> 00:48:15,823
Chatting not about Heidegger
But wine

736
00:48:15,991 --> 00:48:19,493
Let's open up a restaurant
In Santa Fe

737
00:48:19,661 --> 00:48:23,664
- Santa Fe
- Our labors would reap financial gain

738
00:48:23,832 --> 00:48:24,957
- Gain
- Gain

739
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:28,502
We'll open up a restaurant
In Santa Fe

740
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:31,881
- Santa Fe
- And save from devastation our brains

741
00:48:32,049 --> 00:48:33,215
Save our brains

742
00:48:33,383 --> 00:48:37,845
We'll pack up all our junk
And fly so far away

743
00:48:38,013 --> 00:48:42,558
Devote ourselves to projects
That sell

744
00:48:42,726 --> 00:48:47,188
We'll open up a restaurant
In Santa Fe

745
00:48:47,356 --> 00:48:52,401
Forget this cold bohemian hell

746
00:49:17,135 --> 00:49:21,889
Do you know the way
To Santa Fe?

747
00:49:22,057 --> 00:49:24,892
You know, tumbleweeds

748
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:27,687
Prairie dogs

749
00:49:28,647 --> 00:49:30,773
Yeah

750
00:49:38,407 --> 00:49:43,786
I'll see you at the show
I'll try and convince Roger to go

751
00:49:45,539 --> 00:49:49,125
- Alone at last
- He'll be back. I guarantee.

752
00:49:49,292 --> 00:49:54,922
- I've been hearing violins all night.
- Anything to do with me?

753
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:57,591
Are we a thing?

754
00:49:57,926 --> 00:50:00,136
Darling, we're everything.

755
00:50:00,303 --> 00:50:02,304
Live in my house

756
00:50:02,472 --> 00:50:04,473
I'll be your shelter

757
00:50:04,641 --> 00:50:09,186
Just pay me back
With 1000 kisses

758
00:50:09,354 --> 00:50:11,397
Be my lover

759
00:50:11,565 --> 00:50:17,319
And I'll cover you

760
00:50:17,487 --> 00:50:21,699
Open your door
I'll be your tenant

761
00:50:21,867 --> 00:50:25,828
Don't got much baggage
To lay at your feet

762
00:50:25,996 --> 00:50:29,623
But sweet kisses I've got to spare

763
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:35,004
I'll be there and I'll cover you

764
00:50:35,172 --> 00:50:37,256
- I think they meant it
- I think they meant it

765
00:50:37,424 --> 00:50:39,175
When they said you can't buy love

766
00:50:39,342 --> 00:50:40,801
Now I know you can rent it

767
00:50:40,969 --> 00:50:44,597
- A new lease you are, my love
- A new lease you are, my love

768
00:50:44,765 --> 00:50:47,892
- On life
- On life

769
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:51,479
- Be my life
- Be my life

770
00:50:56,318 --> 00:50:58,235
- Girl, where you taking me?
- Wherever you wanna go.

771
00:50:58,403 --> 00:51:01,489
- All right.
- My wig, hold on.

772
00:51:01,656 --> 00:51:03,657
Just slip me on

773
00:51:03,825 --> 00:51:05,951
I'll be your blanket

774
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:07,995
Wherever, whatever

775
00:51:08,163 --> 00:51:10,039
I'll be your coat

776
00:51:10,457 --> 00:51:14,251
You'll be my king
And I'll be your castle

777
00:51:14,419 --> 00:51:19,090
No, you'll be my queen
And I'll be your moat

778
00:51:19,257 --> 00:51:20,925
I think they meant it

779
00:51:21,093 --> 00:51:23,177
When they said you can't buy love

780
00:51:23,345 --> 00:51:25,679
Now I know you can rent it

781
00:51:25,847 --> 00:51:28,516
A new lease you are, my love

782
00:51:28,683 --> 00:51:32,061
- On life
- On life

783
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:36,190
- All my life
- All my life

784
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:38,692
- I've longed to discover
- I've longed to discover

785
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:44,657
- Something as true as this is
- Something as true as this is

786
00:51:44,825 --> 00:51:49,245
- So with a thousand sweet kisses
- If you're cold and you're lonely

787
00:51:49,412 --> 00:51:51,705
I'll cover you
With a thousand sweet kisses

788
00:51:51,873 --> 00:51:53,833
- You've got one nickel only
- I'll cover you

789
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,043
With a thousand sweet kisses

790
00:51:56,211 --> 00:51:58,587
- When you're worn-out and tired
- I'll cover you

791
00:51:58,755 --> 00:52:00,297
With a thousand sweet kisses

792
00:52:00,465 --> 00:52:03,050
- When your heart has expired
- I'll cover you

793
00:52:03,218 --> 00:52:06,387
- Oh, lover
- Oh, lover

794
00:52:06,555 --> 00:52:07,930
- I'll cover you
- I'll cover you

795
00:52:08,431 --> 00:52:11,725
- Yeah, yeah, yeah
- Yeah, yeah, yeah

796
00:52:11,893 --> 00:52:15,396
- Oh, lover
- Oh, lover

797
00:52:15,564 --> 00:52:21,485
- I'll cover you
- I'll cover you

798
00:52:32,664 --> 00:52:37,543
Steve, Joanne. The Murget case?
A dismissal. Good work, counselor.

799
00:52:37,711 --> 00:52:40,129
We're okay

800
00:52:40,297 --> 00:52:42,590
Honey bear, wait
I'm on the other phone

801
00:52:42,757 --> 00:52:47,595
Yes, I have the cowbell
We're okay

802
00:52:47,762 --> 00:52:50,014
So tell them we'll sue
But a settlement will do

803
00:52:50,182 --> 00:52:52,433
Sexual harassment
And civil rights too

804
00:52:52,601 --> 00:52:55,186
Oh, Steve, you're great
No, you cut the paper plate

805
00:52:55,353 --> 00:52:58,105
Did you cheat on Mark
A lot would you say?

806
00:52:58,273 --> 00:53:00,608
We're okay

807
00:53:00,775 --> 00:53:04,612
Honey, hold on.
Steve, I need- Hold on.

808
00:53:04,779 --> 00:53:05,946
Hello?

809
00:53:06,114 --> 00:53:08,324
Dad, yes, I beeped you

810
00:53:08,491 --> 00:53:10,993
Maureen is coming
To Mother's hearing

811
00:53:11,161 --> 00:53:13,454
We're okay

812
00:53:13,622 --> 00:53:16,832
Honey bear, what?
Newt's lesbian sister? I'll tell them.

813
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,334
You heard? They heard.

814
00:53:18,501 --> 00:53:21,212
We're okay

815
00:53:21,379 --> 00:53:23,797
And you, Dad
Yep, Jill is there

816
00:53:23,965 --> 00:53:26,133
Steve, got-
Jill with the short, black hair

817
00:53:26,301 --> 00:53:28,135
The Calvin Klein model?
Steve, gotta go

818
00:53:28,303 --> 00:53:32,056
The model who lives
In Penthouse A?

819
00:53:34,184 --> 00:53:35,726
We're

820
00:53:36,937 --> 00:53:42,316
We're okay

821
00:53:42,484 --> 00:53:45,444
I'm on my way

822
00:53:54,454 --> 00:54:00,584
Christmas bells are ringing
Christmas bells are ringing

823
00:54:00,752 --> 00:54:06,924
Christmas bells are singing
On TV at Saks

824
00:54:07,092 --> 00:54:10,219
Honest living, honest living
Honest living, honest living

825
00:54:10,387 --> 00:54:16,267
Can't you spare a dime or two
Here but for the grace of God go you

826
00:54:16,434 --> 00:54:18,686
You'll be merry
I'll be merry

827
00:54:18,853 --> 00:54:22,022
Though merry
Ain't in my vocabulary

828
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:25,526
No sleigh bells
No Santa Claus

829
00:54:25,694 --> 00:54:28,028
No yule log
No tinsel

830
00:54:28,196 --> 00:54:30,447
No holly
No hearth

831
00:54:30,615 --> 00:54:33,867
- No
- Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

832
00:54:34,035 --> 00:54:40,082
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
No room at the Holiday Inn

833
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:42,960
Oh, no

834
00:54:43,128 --> 00:54:48,716
And it's beginning to snow

835
00:54:48,925 --> 00:54:51,927
Hats, bats, shoes, booze
Mountain bikes, potpourri

836
00:54:52,095 --> 00:54:55,306
Leather bags, girlie mags
Forty-fives, AZT

837
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,276
No one's buying
Feel like crying

838
00:55:13,658 --> 00:55:19,580
No room at the Holiday Inn
Oh, no

839
00:55:19,748 --> 00:55:25,294
And it's beginning to snow

840
00:55:25,462 --> 00:55:28,380
How about a fur
In perfect shape

841
00:55:28,548 --> 00:55:31,717
Owned by an MBA from uptown?

842
00:55:31,885 --> 00:55:34,595
I got a tweed
Broken in by a greedy

843
00:55:34,763 --> 00:55:37,639
Broker who went broke
And then broke down

844
00:55:38,224 --> 00:55:43,896
- You don't have to do this
- Hush your mouth, it's Christmas

845
00:55:44,064 --> 00:55:49,651
I do not deserve you, Angel

846
00:55:49,819 --> 00:55:52,905
- Give, give
- Wait

847
00:55:53,073 --> 00:55:57,743
- All you do is give
- What's on the floor?

848
00:55:57,911 --> 00:56:01,663
- Give me some way
- Let's see some more

849
00:56:01,831 --> 00:56:05,501
- To show
- No, no, no

850
00:56:05,668 --> 00:56:11,382
How you've touched me so

851
00:56:11,549 --> 00:56:16,678
Kiss me
It's beginning to snow

852
00:56:16,846 --> 00:56:19,890
She said
"Would you light my candle?"

853
00:56:20,058 --> 00:56:21,392
And she put on a pout

854
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:24,228
And she wanted you
To take her out tonight?

855
00:56:24,396 --> 00:56:25,729
- Right
- She got you out

856
00:56:25,897 --> 00:56:28,774
She was more than okay
But I pushed her away

857
00:56:28,942 --> 00:56:32,152
It was bad, I got mad
And I had to get her

858
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,987
Out of my sight

859
00:56:34,155 --> 00:56:36,281
Wait, wait, wait
You said she was sweet

860
00:56:36,449 --> 00:56:39,118
Let's go eat
I'll just get fat

861
00:56:39,285 --> 00:56:44,331
It's the one vice left
When you're dead meat

862
00:56:44,499 --> 00:56:47,209
- There, that's her
- Maureen?

863
00:56:47,377 --> 00:56:48,836
Mimi!

864
00:56:49,671 --> 00:56:53,882
I should go
Hey, it's beginning to snow

865
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:58,846
I'm dreaming of a white
Right Christmas

866
00:56:59,013 --> 00:57:05,227
Follow the man, follow the man
With his pockets full of the jam

867
00:57:05,395 --> 00:57:08,230
Follow the man, follow the man

868
00:57:08,398 --> 00:57:13,485
Help me out, Daddy, if you can

869
00:57:13,653 --> 00:57:16,613
- Got any D, man?
- I'm cool

870
00:57:16,781 --> 00:57:19,867
- Got any C, man?
- I'm cool

871
00:57:20,034 --> 00:57:21,452
Got any X? Any smack?

872
00:57:21,619 --> 00:57:26,582
Any horse? Any jugie boogie boy?
Any blow?

873
00:57:27,459 --> 00:57:31,044
- Hey
- Hey

874
00:57:31,212 --> 00:57:35,299
I just want to say
I'm sorry for the way

875
00:57:35,467 --> 00:57:39,386
- Forget it
- I blew up

876
00:57:39,554 --> 00:57:41,763
- Can I make it up to you?
- How?

877
00:57:41,931 --> 00:57:43,765
- Dinner party?
- That'll do

878
00:57:43,933 --> 00:57:48,228
Hey, lover boy, cutie pie
You steal my client, you die

879
00:57:48,396 --> 00:57:50,481
You didn't miss me
You won't miss her

880
00:57:50,648 --> 00:57:52,941
You'll never lack for customers

881
00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:58,238
I'm willin', I'm illin'
I gotta get my sickness off

882
00:57:58,406 --> 00:58:05,120
Gotta run, gotta ride
Gotta gun, gotta hide, gotta go

883
00:58:05,288 --> 00:58:07,748
And it's beginning to snow

884
00:58:07,957 --> 00:58:10,292
We're out of luck, Allison
The protest is on

885
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:13,921
L.L.Bean, Geoffrey Beene
Burberry zip out lining

886
00:58:14,088 --> 00:58:17,132
Mark, this is Mimi.
She'll be dining with us.

887
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,092
- Here's a new arrival
- That is an ounce

888
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,595
- Hats, bats, rats
- That's my coat

889
00:58:21,763 --> 00:58:24,014
- We give discounts
- I think we've met

890
00:58:24,182 --> 00:58:25,807
- Let's get a better one
- It's a sham

891
00:58:25,975 --> 00:58:28,310
- That's what he said
- I said it's a gram

892
00:58:28,478 --> 00:58:30,479
- She's a thief
- But she brought us together

893
00:58:30,647 --> 00:58:33,106
- Which investor is coming?
- I'll take the leather

894
00:58:33,274 --> 00:58:34,650
Your father? Damn.

895
00:58:34,817 --> 00:58:41,031
Let's go to the lot

896
00:58:41,324 --> 00:58:44,826
Maureen's performing

897
00:58:44,994 --> 00:58:46,787
- Who's Maureen?
- His ex.

898
00:58:47,413 --> 00:58:52,793
But I am over her

899
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:58,507
I should tell you
I have to tell you

900
00:58:59,467 --> 00:59:04,972
- Let's not hold hands yet
- Is that a warning?

901
00:59:06,975 --> 00:59:13,981
I need to take it slow

902
00:59:14,148 --> 00:59:18,652
I should tell you, I should tell you
I should tell you, I should tell you

903
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:20,153
I should tell you
I-

904
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:25,158
And it's beginning to
And it's beginning to

905
00:59:25,326 --> 00:59:31,456
And it's beginning to

906
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:39,214
Joanne? Which way to the stage?

907
00:59:39,382 --> 00:59:45,304
Snow

908
00:59:53,563 --> 00:59:55,355
Maureen's performance.

909
00:59:58,067 --> 01:00:00,777
Last night I had a dream.

910
01:00:01,154 --> 01:00:05,449
I found myself in a desert
called Cyberland.

911
01:00:05,617 --> 01:00:06,658
It was hot.

912
01:00:06,826 --> 01:00:09,536
My canteen had sprung a leak,
and I was...

913
01:00:09,704 --> 01:00:11,496
...thirsty.

914
01:00:11,706 --> 01:00:13,999
Out of the abyss walked a cow.

915
01:00:14,167 --> 01:00:15,542
Elsie.

916
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:19,463
I asked if she had anything to drink.
She said:

917
01:00:20,048 --> 01:00:25,719
"I'm forbidden to produce milk

918
01:00:26,179 --> 01:00:29,222
In Cyberland we only drink

919
01:00:30,016 --> 01:00:31,892
Diet Coke"

920
01:00:32,602 --> 01:00:33,852
Yes.

921
01:00:35,313 --> 01:00:36,605
She said:

922
01:00:37,398 --> 01:00:39,399
"Only thing to do

923
01:00:39,567 --> 01:00:44,112
Is jump over the moon

924
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:49,242
They've closed everything real down
Like barns and troughs

925
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:56,208
And performance spaces

926
01:00:57,001 --> 01:01:03,548
And replaced it all with lies
And rules and virtual life"

927
01:01:06,552 --> 01:01:08,303
But there is a way out.

928
01:01:09,514 --> 01:01:14,935
Leap of faith, leap of faith
Leap of faith, leap of faith

929
01:01:15,103 --> 01:01:21,733
Only thing to do
Is jump over the moon

930
01:01:22,527 --> 01:01:27,155
I gotta get out of here

931
01:01:27,323 --> 01:01:30,951
It's like I'm being tied to the hood
Of a yellow rental truck

932
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:33,912
Packed in
With fertilizer and fuel oil

933
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:38,458
Pushed over a cliff
By a suicidal Mickey Mouse

934
01:01:38,626 --> 01:01:40,335
I've

935
01:01:40,503 --> 01:01:43,588
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta

936
01:01:43,756 --> 01:01:46,550
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta

937
01:01:48,177 --> 01:01:51,054
Gotta, gotta find a way

938
01:01:51,222 --> 01:01:54,349
To jump over the moon

939
01:01:55,143 --> 01:02:01,857
Only thing to do
Is jump over the moon

940
01:02:02,024 --> 01:02:04,317
Then a little bulldog entered.

941
01:02:04,485 --> 01:02:06,319
His name, we have learned,
was Benny.

942
01:02:07,155 --> 01:02:09,156
And although he once
had principles...

943
01:02:09,365 --> 01:02:11,324
...he abandoned them
to live as a lapdog...

944
01:02:11,492 --> 01:02:13,452
...to a wealthy daughter
of the revolution.

945
01:02:13,661 --> 01:02:18,373
A one, two, three
"That's bull," Benny said

946
01:02:18,541 --> 01:02:23,503
"Ever since the cat took up the fiddle
That cow's been jumpy

947
01:02:23,671 --> 01:02:26,631
The dish and the spoon were evicted
From the table and eloped

948
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:30,177
She's had trouble with her milk
And the moon ever since

949
01:02:30,344 --> 01:02:34,514
Maybe it's a female thing

950
01:02:34,682 --> 01:02:38,769
'Cause who'd wanna leave
Cyberland anyway?

951
01:02:38,936 --> 01:02:40,520
Walls ain't so bad

952
01:02:40,688 --> 01:02:43,607
The dish and the spoon, for instance
They're down on their luck

953
01:02:43,775 --> 01:02:45,525
They come knockin'
On my doghouse door

954
01:02:45,693 --> 01:02:50,697
And I said
'Not in my backyard, utensils.

955
01:02:50,865 --> 01:02:53,366
Go back to China"'

956
01:02:55,203 --> 01:03:00,207
"The only way out is up"
Elsie whispered to me

957
01:03:01,417 --> 01:03:04,169
"A leap

958
01:03:04,337 --> 01:03:11,343
Of faith"

959
01:03:12,053 --> 01:03:13,887
"Still thirsty?"

960
01:03:14,055 --> 01:03:16,014
"Parched. "

961
01:03:17,642 --> 01:03:20,393
"Have some milk. "

962
01:03:20,603 --> 01:03:23,605
And I lowered myself
beneath her swollen udder...

963
01:03:23,773 --> 01:03:28,443
...and sucked the sweetest milk
I had ever tasted.

964
01:03:30,238 --> 01:03:33,073
"Climb onboard," she said

965
01:03:33,241 --> 01:03:36,535
And as a harvest moon
rose over Cyberland...

966
01:03:36,911 --> 01:03:38,954
...we reared back,
we sprang into a gallop...

967
01:03:39,121 --> 01:03:40,580
...leaping out of orbit.

968
01:03:40,748 --> 01:03:43,166
I awoke, singing...

969
01:03:44,836 --> 01:03:46,795
Singing.

970
01:03:47,713 --> 01:03:49,714
Shit.

971
01:03:50,842 --> 01:03:53,677
Leap of faith
Leap of faith

972
01:03:53,845 --> 01:03:56,429
Leap of faith
Leap of faith

973
01:03:56,597 --> 01:03:59,432
Only thing to do

974
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:02,435
Only thing to do is jump

975
01:04:02,603 --> 01:04:07,941
Only thing to do is
Jump over the moon

976
01:04:08,568 --> 01:04:14,281
Only thing to do is
Jump over the moon

977
01:04:14,574 --> 01:04:17,450
Over the moon

978
01:04:17,618 --> 01:04:21,454
Over the...

979
01:04:33,634 --> 01:04:35,468
Moo with me.

980
01:04:35,636 --> 01:04:39,806
Moo, yes. Oh, it's so great.
Yeah. Up there, let me hear you.

981
01:04:42,143 --> 01:04:44,144
Yes!

982
01:04:48,316 --> 01:04:50,233
Thank you.

983
01:05:15,259 --> 01:05:17,510
No, please, no, not tonight
Mister, can't you go?

984
01:05:17,678 --> 01:05:19,387
- Can't have a scene
- What?

985
01:05:19,555 --> 01:05:22,223
Please go. You- Hello sir.
I said no. Important customer.

986
01:05:22,391 --> 01:05:23,475
What am I, just a blur?

987
01:05:23,643 --> 01:05:26,728
- You sit all night, you never buy
- That's a lie, that's a lie

988
01:05:26,896 --> 01:05:30,065
- I had a tea the other day
- You couldn't pay

989
01:05:30,232 --> 01:05:32,067
Oh, yeah.

990
01:05:32,234 --> 01:05:35,362
Benjamin Coffin III, here?

991
01:05:35,529 --> 01:05:37,197
Oh, no

992
01:05:37,406 --> 01:05:38,949
Wine and beer

993
01:05:39,325 --> 01:05:42,077
The enemy of Avenue A

994
01:05:42,244 --> 01:05:44,746
And Mr. Grey.

995
01:05:44,914 --> 01:05:49,876
What brings the mogul in his own
mind to the Life Cafe?

996
01:05:50,044 --> 01:05:55,632
I would like to propose a toast
to Maureen's noble try.

997
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,425
- It went well.
- Go to hell.

998
01:05:57,593 --> 01:05:59,177
Was the yuppie scum stomped?

999
01:05:59,345 --> 01:06:01,972
Not counting the homeless,
how many tickets weren't comped?

1000
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:04,391
- Why did Muffy-
- Allison.

1001
01:06:04,558 --> 01:06:05,558
Miss the show?

1002
01:06:05,726 --> 01:06:07,811
There was a death in the family
if you must know.

1003
01:06:08,437 --> 01:06:10,230
- Sorry.
- Who died?

1004
01:06:10,398 --> 01:06:11,773
Our Akita.

1005
01:06:11,941 --> 01:06:13,066
- Evita.
- Evita.

1006
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:16,236
Mimi. I'm surprised.

1007
01:06:16,404 --> 01:06:19,322
A bright and charming girl like you

1008
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:25,578
Hangs out with these slackers
Who don't adhere to deals

1009
01:06:25,746 --> 01:06:26,788
They make fun

1010
01:06:26,956 --> 01:06:30,375
Yet I'm the one
Attempting to do some good

1011
01:06:30,543 --> 01:06:33,211
Or do you really want
A neighborhood

1012
01:06:33,379 --> 01:06:36,297
Where people piss
On your stoop every night?

1013
01:06:37,091 --> 01:06:42,178
Bohemia
Bohemia's a fallacy in your head

1014
01:06:42,596 --> 01:06:45,598
This is Calcutta

1015
01:06:46,183 --> 01:06:49,310
Bohemia is dead

1016
01:06:50,646 --> 01:06:52,397
Dearly beloved

1017
01:06:52,606 --> 01:06:58,611
We gather here
To say our goodbyes

1018
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:05,618
Here she lies

1019
01:07:05,786 --> 01:07:09,289
No one knew her worth

1020
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:14,836
The late, great daughter
Of Mother Earth

1021
01:07:15,004 --> 01:07:20,008
On this night
When we celebrate the birth

1022
01:07:23,971 --> 01:07:27,432
In that little town of Bethlehem

1023
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:32,228
We raise our glass
You bet your ass

1024
01:07:32,396 --> 01:07:34,064
To

1025
01:07:34,523 --> 01:07:39,319
La vie

1026
01:07:39,487 --> 01:07:44,491
Bohème

1027
01:07:45,993 --> 01:07:47,535
La vie bohème

1028
01:07:49,997 --> 01:07:51,372
La vie bohème

1029
01:07:53,709 --> 01:07:55,126
La vie bohème

1030
01:07:57,254 --> 01:07:59,506
- La vie bohème
- To days of inspiration

1031
01:07:59,673 --> 01:08:02,467
Playing hooky
Makin' something out of nothing

1032
01:08:02,676 --> 01:08:04,677
The need to express
To communicate

1033
01:08:05,262 --> 01:08:08,431
To going against the grain
Going insane

1034
01:08:08,599 --> 01:08:11,643
- La vie bohème
- Going mad

1035
01:08:11,811 --> 01:08:13,394
- La vie bohème
- To loving tension

1036
01:08:13,562 --> 01:08:15,897
No pension
To more than one dimension

1037
01:08:16,065 --> 01:08:19,692
To starving for attention,
Hating convention, hating pretension

1038
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:25,698
Not to mention, of course
Hating dear old Mom and Dad

1039
01:08:26,534 --> 01:08:31,412
To riding your bike midday
Past the three-piece suits

1040
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:33,873
To fruits
To no absolutes

1041
01:08:34,041 --> 01:08:35,500
To Absolut
To choice

1042
01:08:35,668 --> 01:08:37,335
To the Village Voice

1043
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:41,631
To any passing fad

1044
01:08:41,799 --> 01:08:48,179
To being an us for once
Instead of a them

1045
01:08:48,347 --> 01:08:51,850
La vie bohème

1046
01:08:52,017 --> 01:08:53,059
La vie bohème

1047
01:08:53,227 --> 01:08:56,604
- Is the equipment in a pyramid?
- It is, Maureen

1048
01:08:56,772 --> 01:09:01,234
The mixer doesn't have a case
Don't give me that face

1049
01:09:02,111 --> 01:09:05,405
Hey, mister
She's my sister

1050
01:09:05,573 --> 01:09:08,074
So that's five miso soup
Four seaweed salad

1051
01:09:08,242 --> 01:09:10,618
Three soy-burger dinner
Two tofu-dog platter

1052
01:09:10,786 --> 01:09:12,787
And one pasta with meatless balls

1053
01:09:15,082 --> 01:09:16,291
It tastes the same

1054
01:09:16,834 --> 01:09:18,209
If you close your eyes

1055
01:09:18,377 --> 01:09:23,006
- And 13 orders of fries, is that it here?
- Wine and beer

1056
01:09:23,174 --> 01:09:26,551
To handcrafted beers
Made in local breweries

1057
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:28,261
To yoga
To yogurt

1058
01:09:28,429 --> 01:09:30,430
To rice and beans and cheese

1059
01:09:30,598 --> 01:09:32,348
To leather
To dildos

1060
01:09:32,516 --> 01:09:36,102
To curry vindaloo
To huevos rancheros

1061
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:38,021
And Maya Angelou

1062
01:09:38,189 --> 01:09:41,441
Emotion, devotion
To causing a commotion

1063
01:09:41,650 --> 01:09:43,151
Creation
Vacation

1064
01:09:43,944 --> 01:09:45,445
Mucho masturbation

1065
01:09:45,613 --> 01:09:47,155
Compassion
To fashion

1066
01:09:47,323 --> 01:09:48,990
To passion when it's new

1067
01:09:49,158 --> 01:09:50,783
- To Sontag
- To Sondheim

1068
01:09:50,951 --> 01:09:52,785
To anything taboo

1069
01:09:52,953 --> 01:09:56,331
Ginsberg, Dylan, Cunningham
And Cage

1070
01:09:56,874 --> 01:09:58,082
Lenny Bruce

1071
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:00,585
- Langston Hughes
- To the stage

1072
01:10:00,753 --> 01:10:02,462
- To Uta
- To Buddha

1073
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:06,716
Pablo Neruda too

1074
01:10:07,218 --> 01:10:10,637
Why Dorothy and Toto
Went over the rainbow

1075
01:10:10,804 --> 01:10:13,640
To blow off Auntie Em

1076
01:10:13,807 --> 01:10:17,560
La vie bohème

1077
01:10:18,187 --> 01:10:20,730
And wipe the speakers off
Before you pack

1078
01:10:20,898 --> 01:10:24,525
- Yes, Maureen
- Well, hurry back

1079
01:10:24,693 --> 01:10:28,154
- Sisters?
- We're close.

1080
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:31,866
Brothers

1081
01:10:32,368 --> 01:10:35,078
Bisexuals, trisexuals
Homo sapiens

1082
01:10:35,246 --> 01:10:39,082
Carcinogens, hallucinogens, men

8BC
To no shame

1090
01:10:54,848 --> 01:10:57,225
Never playin' the fame game

1091
01:10:58,352 --> 01:11:01,062
- To marijuana
- To sodomy

1092
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:03,523
It's between God and me

1093
01:11:04,024 --> 01:11:05,400
To S & M

1094
01:11:05,567 --> 01:11:06,651
Waiter, waiter, waiter.

1095
01:11:06,819 --> 01:11:10,321
La vie bohème

1096
01:11:10,489 --> 01:11:12,115
In honor of the death of bohemia...

1097
01:11:12,283 --> 01:11:15,285
...an impromptu salon will commence
immediately following dinner.

1098
01:11:15,452 --> 01:11:17,704
Mimi Marquez,
clad only in bubblewrap...

1099
01:11:17,871 --> 01:11:20,665
...will perform her famous
lawn-chair handcuff dance...

1100
01:11:20,833 --> 01:11:23,710
...to the sounds of iced tea
being stirred.

1101
01:11:23,877 --> 01:11:27,213
And Mark Cohen will preview
his new documentary...

1102
01:11:27,756 --> 01:11:31,551
...about his inability to hold an erection
on the High Holy Days.

1103
01:11:31,719 --> 01:11:34,262
Maureen Johnson,
back from her spectacular...

1104
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:36,723
...one-night engagement
at the 11th Street lot...

1105
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:39,392
...will sing native American
tribal chants backwards...

1106
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:42,478
...through her vocoder, accompanying
herself on electric cello.

1107
01:11:42,646 --> 01:11:45,064
Which she has never studied.

1108
01:11:45,232 --> 01:11:47,817
Your new boyfriend
Doesn't know about us

1109
01:11:47,985 --> 01:11:51,446
- There's nothing to know
- Don't you think we should discuss?

1110
01:11:51,613 --> 01:11:54,824
- It was three months ago
- He doesn't act like he's with you

1111
01:11:54,992 --> 01:11:57,118
- We're taking it slow
- Where is he now?

1112
01:11:57,286 --> 01:11:59,912
He's right-
Where'd he go?

1113
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:03,082
And Roger will attempt to write
a bittersweet, evocative song...

1114
01:12:06,462 --> 01:12:08,838
...that doesn't remind us
of "Musetta's Waltz. "

1115
01:12:10,132 --> 01:12:13,426
Angel Dumott Schunard will model
the latest fall fashions from Paris...

1116
01:12:13,594 --> 01:12:16,679
...while accompanying herself
on the 10-gallon plastic pickle tub.

1117
01:12:16,847 --> 01:12:19,599
And Collins will recount
his exploits as anarchist...

1118
01:12:19,767 --> 01:12:22,060
...including his successful
reprogramming...

1119
01:12:22,227 --> 01:12:25,938
...of the MIT virtual-reality
equipment to self-destruct...

1120
01:12:26,106 --> 01:12:27,607
...as it broadcasts the words:

1121
01:12:28,442 --> 01:12:32,612
Actual reality. ACT UP. Fight AIDS.

1122
01:12:32,946 --> 01:12:36,657
Excuse me
Did I do somethin' wrong?

1123
01:12:36,825 --> 01:12:40,453
I get invited, then ignored
All night long

1124
01:12:40,621 --> 01:12:42,872
I've been tryin'
I'm not lyin'

1125
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,501
No one's perfect
I've got baggage

1126
01:12:46,668 --> 01:12:49,629
Life's too short, babe
Time is flyin'

1127
01:12:49,797 --> 01:12:53,674
I'm lookin' for baggage
That goes with mine

1128
01:12:54,468 --> 01:12:57,053
- I should tell you
- I've got baggage too

1129
01:12:57,221 --> 01:12:58,638
- Should tell you-
- Baggage

1130
01:12:58,806 --> 01:13:00,765
Wine and beer

1131
01:13:03,977 --> 01:13:06,270
AZT break.

1132
01:13:10,359 --> 01:13:12,151
You?

1133
01:13:13,821 --> 01:13:15,321
Me

1134
01:13:15,489 --> 01:13:16,656
You?

1135
01:13:18,534 --> 01:13:21,953
Mimi

1136
01:13:30,295 --> 01:13:34,340
I should tell you
I'm disaster

1137
01:13:34,842 --> 01:13:38,010
I forget how to begin it

1138
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:42,765
Let's just make this part go faster

1139
01:13:42,933 --> 01:13:47,979
I have yet to be in it
I should tell you

1140
01:13:48,188 --> 01:13:50,189
I should tell you

1141
01:13:50,357 --> 01:13:51,899
I should tell you

1142
01:13:52,192 --> 01:13:53,860
I should tell you

1143
01:13:54,027 --> 01:13:59,240
I should tell I blew the candle out

1144
01:13:59,408 --> 01:14:01,868
Just to get back in

1145
01:14:02,244 --> 01:14:06,372
I'd forgotten how to smile

1146
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:10,168
Until your candle burned my skin

1147
01:14:10,335 --> 01:14:12,211
I should tell you

1148
01:14:12,379 --> 01:14:14,046
I should tell you

1149
01:14:14,214 --> 01:14:16,007
I should tell you

1150
01:14:16,175 --> 01:14:20,386
- I should tell
- I should tell

1151
01:14:20,554 --> 01:14:25,391
- Well, here we go
- Well, here we go

1152
01:14:27,227 --> 01:14:30,771
- Now we
- Now we

1153
01:14:31,607 --> 01:14:33,649
Oh, no

1154
01:14:33,817 --> 01:14:38,237
I know this something is

1155
01:14:38,405 --> 01:14:41,115
- Here goes
- Here goes

1156
01:14:41,283 --> 01:14:44,744
Guess so, it's starting to

1157
01:14:45,412 --> 01:14:47,663
- Who knows?
- Who knows?

1158
01:14:47,831 --> 01:14:51,000
- Who knows where?
- Who knows where?

1159
01:14:51,168 --> 01:14:54,670
- Who goes there?
- Who goes there?

1160
01:14:54,838 --> 01:14:57,673
- Who knows?
- Who knows?

1161
01:14:57,841 --> 01:15:00,760
- Here goes
- Here goes

1162
01:15:00,928 --> 01:15:03,554
- Trusting desire
- Trusting desire

1163
01:15:03,722 --> 01:15:07,600
- Starting to learn
- Starting to learn

1164
01:15:07,768 --> 01:15:10,186
- Walking through fire
- Walking through fire

1165
01:15:10,354 --> 01:15:14,273
- Without a burn
- Without a burn

1166
01:15:14,441 --> 01:15:17,068
- Clinging a shoulder
- Clinging a shoulder

1167
01:15:17,236 --> 01:15:20,279
- A leap begins
- A leap begins

1168
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:23,491
- Stinging and older
- Stinging and older

1169
01:15:23,659 --> 01:15:26,953
- Asleep on pins
- Asleep on pins

1170
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:33,876
- So here we go
- So here we go

1171
01:15:34,294 --> 01:15:35,753
- Now we
- Now we

1172
01:15:36,004 --> 01:15:37,630
Oh, no

1173
01:15:37,798 --> 01:15:41,050
- I know
- Oh, no

1174
01:15:41,218 --> 01:15:44,303
- Who knows where?
- Who knows where?

1175
01:15:44,471 --> 01:15:48,558
- Who goes there?
- Who goes there?

1176
01:15:48,725 --> 01:15:52,520
- Here goes
- Here goes

1177
01:15:52,688 --> 01:15:56,023
- Here goes
- Here goes

1178
01:15:56,191 --> 01:15:59,318
- Here goes
- Here goes

1179
01:15:59,486 --> 01:16:02,738
- Here goes
- Here goes

1180
01:16:02,906 --> 01:16:06,409
- Here goes
- Here goes

1181
01:16:06,577 --> 01:16:11,664
- Here goes
- Here goes

1182
01:16:12,332 --> 01:16:13,457
Are we packed?

1183
01:16:13,625 --> 01:16:16,711
Yes, and by next week,
I want you to be.

1184
01:16:16,878 --> 01:16:18,296
Pookie-

1185
01:16:18,463 --> 01:16:20,339
And you should see

1186
01:16:20,507 --> 01:16:24,093
They've padlocked your building
And they're rioting on Avenue B

1187
01:16:24,261 --> 01:16:26,345
- Benny called the cops.
- That fuck.

1188
01:16:27,681 --> 01:16:30,516
They don't know what they're doing

1189
01:16:30,684 --> 01:16:33,352
The cops are sweeping the lot

1190
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:38,190
But no one's leaving.
They're just sitting there mooing.

1191
01:16:38,358 --> 01:16:40,067
- To dance
- No way to make a living

1192
01:16:40,235 --> 01:16:41,652
Masochism, pain, perfection

1193
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:44,864
Muscle spasms, chiropractors
Short careers, eating disorders

1194
01:16:45,032 --> 01:16:46,157
- Film
- Adventure, tedium

1195
01:16:46,325 --> 01:16:48,576
No family, boring locations
Darkrooms

1196
01:16:48,744 --> 01:16:51,203
Perfect faces, egos, money
Hollywood and sleaze

1197
01:16:51,371 --> 01:16:53,039
- Music
- Food of love, emotion

1198
01:16:53,206 --> 01:16:55,416
Mathematics, isolation
Rhythm, power

1199
01:16:55,584 --> 01:16:57,918
Feeling, harmony
And heavy competition

1200
01:16:58,086 --> 01:16:59,879
- Anarchy
- Revolution, justice

1201
01:17:00,047 --> 01:17:02,632
Screaming for solutions
Forcing changes, risk and danger

1202
01:17:02,799 --> 01:17:04,133
Making noise and making pleas

1203
01:17:04,301 --> 01:17:07,595
To faggots, lezzies, dykes
Cross-dressers too

1204
01:17:07,763 --> 01:17:09,013
- To me
- To me

1205
01:17:09,181 --> 01:17:11,515
To you and you and you
You and you

1206
01:17:11,683 --> 01:17:13,976
To people living with
Living with, living with

1207
01:17:14,144 --> 01:17:16,562
Not dying from disease

1208
01:17:16,897 --> 01:17:20,066
Let he among us without sin

1209
01:17:20,233 --> 01:17:22,818
Be the first to condemn

1210
01:17:23,236 --> 01:17:26,155
La vie bohème

1211
01:17:26,615 --> 01:17:29,492
La vie bohème

1212
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:33,079
- La vie bohème
- Anyone out of the mainstream

1213
01:17:33,246 --> 01:17:36,290
- La vie bohème
- Is anyone in the mainstream?

1214
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:40,127
- La vie bohème
- Anyone alive with a sex drive

1215
01:17:40,295 --> 01:17:41,754
- La vie bohème
- Tear down the wall

1216
01:17:41,922 --> 01:17:43,464
Aren't we all?

1217
01:17:43,632 --> 01:17:46,300
The opposite of war isn't peace

1218
01:17:46,468 --> 01:17:47,802
It's creation

1219
01:17:49,805 --> 01:17:51,806
La vie bohème

1220
01:17:51,973 --> 01:17:56,894
The riot continues.
The Christmas tree goes up in flames.

1221
01:17:57,062 --> 01:17:58,771
The snow dances.

1222
01:17:59,398 --> 01:18:04,610
Oblivious, Mimi and Roger
share a small, lovely kiss.

1223
01:18:12,327 --> 01:18:16,288
Viva la vie bohème!

1224
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:44,333
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

1225
01:28:44,959 --> 01:28:50,255
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Moments so dear

1226
01:28:50,423 --> 01:28:55,594
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

1227
01:28:55,762 --> 01:29:00,599
How do you measure
Measure a year?

1228
01:29:00,767 --> 01:29:06,480
In daylights, in sunsets
In midnights, in cups of coffee

1229
01:29:06,647 --> 01:29:12,027
In inches, in miles
In laughter, in strife

1230
01:29:12,195 --> 01:29:17,115
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

1231
01:29:17,283 --> 01:29:22,120
How do you measure
A year in the life?

1232
01:29:22,288 --> 01:29:27,459
How about love?

1233
01:29:27,627 --> 01:29:32,506
How about love?

1234
01:29:32,673 --> 01:29:38,136
How about love?

1235
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:42,015
Measure in love

1236
01:29:42,183 --> 01:29:48,480
Seasons of love

1237
01:29:48,648 --> 01:29:54,986
Seasons of love

1238
01:29:55,154 --> 01:30:00,158
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

1239
01:30:00,326 --> 01:30:05,705
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Journeys to plan

1240
01:30:05,873 --> 01:30:10,127
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

1241
01:30:10,294 --> 01:30:15,674
How do you measure the life
Of a woman or man?

1242
01:30:15,842 --> 01:30:21,346
In truths that she learned
Or in times that he cried

1243
01:30:21,514 --> 01:30:26,309
In bridges he burned
Or the way that she died

1244
01:30:26,477 --> 01:30:31,440
It's time now to sing out
The story never ends

1245
01:30:31,607 --> 01:30:36,570
Let's celebrate
Remember a year in the life of friends

1246
01:30:36,737 --> 01:30:39,030
Remember the love

1247
01:30:39,198 --> 01:30:43,869
You got to
You got to remember the love

1248
01:30:44,036 --> 01:30:48,623
Don't you know
Got to give love

1249
01:30:48,791 --> 01:30:54,463
Give love
Give love

1250
01:30:54,630 --> 01:30:59,718
Measure, measure your life
In love

1251
01:30:59,886 --> 01:31:05,265
Seasons of love

1252
01:31:05,433 --> 01:31:09,394
Seasons of love

1253
01:31:09,562 --> 01:31:15,901
Gonna be loved
Loved

1254
01:31:23,451 --> 01:31:25,243
Pan to the padlocked door.

1255
01:31:25,411 --> 01:31:26,578
New Year's Rockin' Eve.

1256
01:31:26,746 --> 01:31:29,164
The breaking back
into the building party.

1257
01:31:29,332 --> 01:31:31,750
- How long till next year?
- Three and a half minutes.

1258
01:31:31,918 --> 01:31:35,670
I'm giving up my vices
I'm going back

1259
01:31:35,838 --> 01:31:38,465
Back to school

1260
01:31:38,633 --> 01:31:42,177
Eviction or not
This week's been so hot

1261
01:31:42,345 --> 01:31:47,140
That as long as I got you
I know I'll be cool

1262
01:31:47,308 --> 01:31:50,101
I couldn't crack the love code, dear

1263
01:31:50,269 --> 01:31:52,562
Till you made the lock
On my heart explode

1264
01:31:52,730 --> 01:31:55,273
It's gonna be a happy New Year

1265
01:31:56,984 --> 01:32:01,821
A Happy New Year

1266
01:32:02,532 --> 01:32:04,115
Coast is clear

1267
01:32:04,283 --> 01:32:06,660
You're supposed to be working
That's for midnight

1268
01:32:06,827 --> 01:32:09,204
Where are they?
There isn't much time

1269
01:32:09,372 --> 01:32:10,830
Maybe they're dressing

1270
01:32:10,998 --> 01:32:14,251
I mean, what does one wear
That's apropos for a party

1271
01:32:14,418 --> 01:32:15,919
That's also a crime?

1272
01:32:16,087 --> 01:32:17,212
Chips anyone?

1273
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:19,297
You can take the girl
Out of Hicksville

1274
01:32:19,465 --> 01:32:21,758
But you can't take the Hicksville
Out of the girl

1275
01:32:21,926 --> 01:32:25,554
My riot got you on TV
I deserve a royalty

1276
01:32:25,721 --> 01:32:27,889
Be nice, you two
Or no God-awful champagne

1277
01:32:28,266 --> 01:32:29,891
Don't mind if I do
No luck?

1278
01:32:30,059 --> 01:32:32,310
Bolted plywood
Padlocked with a chain

1279
01:32:32,478 --> 01:32:37,774
- A total dead end
- Just like my ex-girlfriend

1280
01:32:39,151 --> 01:32:41,111
Honey, I know you're there

1281
01:32:41,279 --> 01:32:45,740
Please pick up the phone
Are you okay?

1282
01:32:45,908 --> 01:32:48,660
It's not funny
It's not fair

1283
01:32:48,828 --> 01:32:53,999
How can I atone?
Are you okay?

1284
01:32:54,166 --> 01:32:56,084
I lose control
But I can learn to behave

1285
01:32:56,252 --> 01:32:59,212
Give me one more chance
Let me be your slave

1286
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:01,923
I'll kiss your Doc Martens
Let me kiss your Doc Martens

1287
01:33:02,091 --> 01:33:04,551
Your every wish I will obey

1288
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:09,931
That might be okay.
Down, girl. Heel, stay.

1289
01:33:10,099 --> 01:33:14,853
I did a bit of research
With my friends at Legal Aid

1290
01:33:15,021 --> 01:33:17,856
Technically, you're squatters
There's hope

1291
01:33:18,024 --> 01:33:19,941
- But just in case
- Rope!

1292
01:33:20,192 --> 01:33:23,028
- We can hoist a line
- To the fire escape

1293
01:33:23,195 --> 01:33:25,989
- And tie off at that bench
- That bench

1294
01:33:26,157 --> 01:33:32,162
- I can't take them as chums
- Start hoisting, wench

1295
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:35,624
I think I should be laughing
Yet I forget

1296
01:33:35,791 --> 01:33:38,084
Forget how to begin

1297
01:33:38,252 --> 01:33:41,963
I'm feeling something inside
And yet I still can't decide

1298
01:33:42,131 --> 01:33:46,134
If I should hide
Or make a wide-open grin

1299
01:33:46,969 --> 01:33:51,848
Last week I wanted just to disappear
My life was dust

1300
01:33:52,016 --> 01:33:56,853
But now it just may be
A happy new year

1301
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:00,148
A happy new year

1302
01:34:02,568 --> 01:34:06,237
- Bond. James Bond.
- And Pussy Galore, in person.

1303
01:34:06,405 --> 01:34:07,906
Pussy, you came prepared.

1304
01:34:08,074 --> 01:34:10,241
I was a Boy Scout once,
and a Brownie...

1305
01:34:10,409 --> 01:34:11,743
...till some brat got scared.

1306
01:34:11,911 --> 01:34:15,955
- Moneypenny, my martini
- Will bad champagne do?

1307
01:34:16,123 --> 01:34:18,750
- That's shaken, not stirred
- Pussy, the bolts

1308
01:34:18,918 --> 01:34:20,168
Just say the word

1309
01:34:20,336 --> 01:34:22,128
Two minutes left to execute our plan

1310
01:34:22,296 --> 01:34:24,255
- Where's everyone else?
- Playing Spider-Man

1311
01:34:24,423 --> 01:34:28,259
Ironic close-up tight
On the phone machine's red light

1312
01:34:28,427 --> 01:34:34,933
Once the boho boys are gone
The power mysteriously comes on

1313
01:34:36,477 --> 01:34:38,770
Mark, it's the Wicked Witch
Of the West

1314
01:34:38,938 --> 01:34:43,274
Your mother
Happy New Year from Scarsdale

1315
01:34:43,442 --> 01:34:47,153
We're all impressed that the riot
Footage made the nightly news

1316
01:34:47,321 --> 01:34:52,367
Even your father says mazel tov
Honey, call him

1317
01:34:52,535 --> 01:34:54,953
Love, Mom

1318
01:34:55,955 --> 01:34:59,958
Mark Cohen, Alexi Darling
From Buzzline

1319
01:35:00,126 --> 01:35:01,668
Oh, that show's so sleazy.

1320
01:35:01,836 --> 01:35:06,673
Your footage of the riots, A-one
Feature segment, network, deal time

1321
01:35:06,841 --> 01:35:09,259
I'm sending you a contract

1322
01:35:09,427 --> 01:35:12,220
Ker-ching, ker-ching

1323
01:35:12,388 --> 01:35:16,808
Marky, give us a call
970-4301

1324
01:35:16,976 --> 01:35:21,479
Or at home try 863-6754
Or my cell phone at 919-555-0090

1325
01:35:21,647 --> 01:35:23,982
Or you can e-mail me
At Darling Alexi Newscom. net

1326
01:35:24,150 --> 01:35:26,776
Or you can page me at-

1327
01:35:28,612 --> 01:35:30,822
- I think we need an agent
- We?

1328
01:35:30,990 --> 01:35:34,325
- That's selling out
- But it's nice to dream

1329
01:35:34,493 --> 01:35:38,705
Yeah! It's network TV
And it's all thanks to me

1330
01:35:38,873 --> 01:35:41,666
Somehow I think I smell the whiff
Of a scheme

1331
01:35:41,834 --> 01:35:43,334
Me too.

1332
01:35:43,502 --> 01:35:46,713
- We can plan another protest
- We?

1333
01:35:46,881 --> 01:35:50,508
This time you can shoot from the start
And you'll direct, starring me!

1334
01:35:50,676 --> 01:35:56,848
Five, four, three, open sesame
Happy New Year

1335
01:35:57,516 --> 01:36:01,311
Happy New Year

1336
01:36:01,479 --> 01:36:05,398
Happy New...

1337
01:36:06,817 --> 01:36:08,777
I see that you've beaten me
To the punch

1338
01:36:08,944 --> 01:36:11,279
- How did you know we'd be here?
- I had a hunch

1339
01:36:11,447 --> 01:36:13,406
- You're not mad?
- I'm here to end this war

1340
01:36:13,574 --> 01:36:15,575
It's a shame you went
And destroyed the door

1341
01:36:16,035 --> 01:36:17,786
Why all of a sudden
The big about-face?

1342
01:36:17,953 --> 01:36:19,704
The credit's yours
You made a good case

1343
01:36:19,872 --> 01:36:21,748
Mimi came to see me
She had much to say

1344
01:36:21,916 --> 01:36:24,209
That's not how you put it
At all yesterday

1345
01:36:24,376 --> 01:36:26,419
I couldn't stop thinking
About the whole mess

1346
01:36:26,587 --> 01:36:28,713
- Mark, you'd wanna get this on film.
- I guess.

1347
01:36:28,881 --> 01:36:32,884
I regret the unlucky circumstances
Of the past seven days

1348
01:36:33,052 --> 01:36:37,013
Circumstance?
You padlocked our door

1349
01:36:37,181 --> 01:36:39,724
And it's with great pleasure
On behalf of CyberArts

1350
01:36:39,892 --> 01:36:41,601
- That I hand you this key
- Golf claps

1351
01:36:41,769 --> 01:36:43,895
- I had no juice in my battery
- Reshoot

1352
01:36:44,063 --> 01:36:46,397
Oh, I see
This is a photo opportunity

1353
01:36:46,565 --> 01:36:50,944
The benevolent god ushers
the poor artists back to their flat.

1354
01:36:51,111 --> 01:36:53,446
Planning on taking
the barbed wire from the lot?

1355
01:36:53,614 --> 01:36:56,407
- Anything but that
- Clearing the lot was a safety concern

1356
01:36:56,575 --> 01:36:58,660
We break ground this month
But you can return

1357
01:36:58,828 --> 01:37:00,787
That's why you're here
With people you hate

1358
01:37:00,955 --> 01:37:02,997
Instead of with Muffy
At Muffy's estate

1359
01:37:03,165 --> 01:37:05,750
I'd honestly rather be with you tonight
Than in Westport

1360
01:37:05,918 --> 01:37:08,920
- Spare us, sport, the sound bite.
- Mimi, since you're so seductive

1361
01:37:09,088 --> 01:37:11,464
Persuade him not to be
So counterproductive

1362
01:37:11,632 --> 01:37:14,467
- Tell them what you wore to my place
- I was on my way to work

1363
01:37:14,635 --> 01:37:17,595
Black leather and lace
My desk was a mess, I'm still sore

1364
01:37:17,763 --> 01:37:19,764
I kicked him
And told him I wasn't his whore

1365
01:37:19,932 --> 01:37:21,975
Your boyfriend know
Who your last boyfriend was?

1366
01:37:22,142 --> 01:37:24,435
I'm not her boyfriend.
I don't care what she does.

1367
01:37:24,603 --> 01:37:29,232
People, is this any way to start
A new year? Have compassion

1368
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:32,569
- Benny just lost his cat
- My dog, but I appreciate that

1369
01:37:33,153 --> 01:37:34,863
My cat had a fall
I went through hell

1370
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:36,990
Like losing-
How'd you know that she fell?

1371
01:37:37,283 --> 01:37:38,908
- Champagne?
- Don't mind if I do

1372
01:37:39,076 --> 01:37:40,952
- To dogs
- No, Benny, to you!

1373
01:37:42,162 --> 01:37:46,124
- Let's make a resolution
- I'll drink to that

1374
01:37:46,292 --> 01:37:48,376
Let's always stay friends

1375
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:52,547
- Though we may have our disputes
- This family tree's got deep roots

1376
01:37:52,715 --> 01:37:56,342
- Friendship is thicker than blood
- That depends

1377
01:37:56,969 --> 01:38:00,638
- Depends on trust
- It depends on true devotion

1378
01:38:00,806 --> 01:38:04,726
- Depends on love
- Depends on not denying emotion

1379
01:38:05,394 --> 01:38:06,978
Perhaps.

1380
01:38:07,146 --> 01:38:10,857
- It's gonna be a happy new year
- I guess

1381
01:38:11,025 --> 01:38:14,068
It's gonna be a happy new year

1382
01:38:14,236 --> 01:38:20,325
- You're right
- It's gonna be a happy new year

1383
01:38:23,704 --> 01:38:25,830
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

1384
01:38:25,998 --> 01:38:32,378
- Coming?
- In a minute, I'm fine, go

1385
01:38:37,176 --> 01:38:40,678
Well, well, well.
What have we here?

1386
01:38:40,846 --> 01:38:46,851
It's gonna be a happy New Year

1387
01:38:47,019 --> 01:38:50,104
There, there. There, there.

1388
01:38:51,482 --> 01:38:56,194
Valentine's Day.
Pan across the empty lot.

1389
01:38:56,362 --> 01:38:59,864
Roger's down at Mimi's, where he's
been for almost two months now.

1390
01:39:00,032 --> 01:39:02,533
Although, he keeps talking
about selling his guitar...

1391
01:39:02,701 --> 01:39:06,579
...and heading out of town.
Still jealous of Benny.

1392
01:39:06,747 --> 01:39:08,498
God knows where Collins
and Angel are.

1393
01:39:08,666 --> 01:39:13,503
Could be that new shantytown
near the river or a suite at the Plaza.

1394
01:39:13,671 --> 01:39:15,213
Maureen and Joanne
are rehearsing.

1395
01:39:15,381 --> 01:39:18,591
- I said, once more from the top!
- I said, no!

1396
01:39:18,759 --> 01:39:21,344
That is, if they're speaking
this week.

1397
01:39:21,512 --> 01:39:23,888
Me? I'm here.

1398
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:26,015
Nowhere.

1399
01:39:26,183 --> 01:39:28,643
The line is, "CyberArts
and its corporate sponsor...

1400
01:39:28,811 --> 01:39:32,271
...Grey Communications, wish
to mitigate the Christmas Eve riots. "

1401
01:39:32,439 --> 01:39:35,692
- What is so difficult about that?
- It just doesn't roll off my tongue.

1402
01:39:35,859 --> 01:39:37,276
I like my version.

1403
01:39:37,444 --> 01:39:41,114
You, dressed as a groundhog
to protest the groundbreaking?

1404
01:39:41,281 --> 01:39:44,242
- It's a metaphor.
- It's less than brilliant.

1405
01:39:44,952 --> 01:39:47,120
- That's it, Miss Ivy League.
- What?

1406
01:39:47,287 --> 01:39:49,205
Ever since New Year's,
I haven't said boo.

1407
01:39:49,373 --> 01:39:50,665
I let you direct.

1408
01:39:50,833 --> 01:39:53,251
Didn't pierce my nipples
because it grossed you out.

1409
01:39:53,419 --> 01:39:56,087
I didn't dance that night
because you wanted to go home.

1410
01:39:56,255 --> 01:39:59,257
You were flirting with the woman
in rubber!

1411
01:40:01,427 --> 01:40:03,428
That's what this is about?

1412
01:40:03,595 --> 01:40:06,097
There will always be women
in rubber flirting with me.

1413
01:40:06,265 --> 01:40:07,807
Give me a break.

1414
01:40:07,975 --> 01:40:12,103
Every single day
I walk down the street

1415
01:40:12,271 --> 01:40:15,648
I hear people say, "Baby"
It's so sweet

1416
01:40:15,816 --> 01:40:19,402
Ever since puberty
Everybody stares at me

1417
01:40:19,570 --> 01:40:23,114
Boys, girls, I can't help it, baby

1418
01:40:23,282 --> 01:40:27,201
So be kind
And don't lose your mind

1419
01:40:27,369 --> 01:40:31,998
Just remember that I'm your baby

1420
01:40:32,166 --> 01:40:35,960
Take me for what I am

1421
01:40:36,128 --> 01:40:39,797
Who I was meant to be

1422
01:40:39,965 --> 01:40:44,135
And if you give a damn

1423
01:40:44,303 --> 01:40:47,472
Take me, baby, or leave me

1424
01:40:50,476 --> 01:40:54,228
Take me, baby, or leave me

1425
01:40:54,646 --> 01:40:58,649
A tiger in a cage
Can never see the sun

1426
01:40:58,817 --> 01:41:02,862
This diva needs her stage
Baby, let's have fun

1427
01:41:03,030 --> 01:41:06,741
You are the one I choose
Folks would kill to fill your shoes

1428
01:41:06,909 --> 01:41:10,328
You love
The limelight too, baby

1429
01:41:10,496 --> 01:41:14,707
So be mine
Or don't waste my time

1430
01:41:14,875 --> 01:41:19,712
Crying, "Oh, honey bear
Are you still my baby?"

1431
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:23,299
Take me for what I am

1432
01:41:23,467 --> 01:41:27,220
Who I was meant to be

1433
01:41:27,387 --> 01:41:31,224
And if you give a damn

1434
01:41:31,391 --> 01:41:34,727
Take me, baby, or leave me

1435
01:41:35,687 --> 01:41:39,857
No way can I be what I'm not

1436
01:41:40,025 --> 01:41:43,486
But, hey, don't you want
Your girl hot?

1437
01:41:43,654 --> 01:41:47,365
Don't fight
Don't lose your head

1438
01:41:47,533 --> 01:41:48,699
'Cause every night

1439
01:41:48,867 --> 01:41:54,247
Who's in your bed?
Who?

1440
01:41:55,833 --> 01:41:59,585
Who's in your bed?

1441
01:41:59,753 --> 01:42:02,046
- Kiss, Pookie.
- It won't work.

1442
01:42:02,214 --> 01:42:03,631
I look before I leap

1443
01:42:03,799 --> 01:42:05,299
I love margins and discipline

1444
01:42:05,467 --> 01:42:09,720
I make lists in my sleep, baby
What's my sin?

1445
01:42:09,888 --> 01:42:11,764
Never quit
I follow through

1446
01:42:11,932 --> 01:42:13,808
I hate mess
But I love you

1447
01:42:13,976 --> 01:42:17,311
What to do
With my impromptu baby?

1448
01:42:17,479 --> 01:42:21,315
So be wise
'Cause this girl satisfies

1449
01:42:21,483 --> 01:42:23,234
You got a prize
So don't compromise

1450
01:42:23,402 --> 01:42:26,279
You're one lucky baby

1451
01:42:26,446 --> 01:42:28,406
Take me for what I am

1452
01:42:28,574 --> 01:42:30,074
A control freak.

1453
01:42:30,242 --> 01:42:32,535
Who I was meant to be

1454
01:42:32,744 --> 01:42:34,203
A snob, yet overattentive.

1455
01:42:34,371 --> 01:42:36,581
And if you give a damn

1456
01:42:36,748 --> 01:42:38,249
A lovable, droll geek.

1457
01:42:38,417 --> 01:42:40,835
Take me, baby, or leave me

1458
01:42:41,003 --> 01:42:42,753
An anal-retentive.

1459
01:42:42,921 --> 01:42:44,422
- That's it
- That's it

1460
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:46,924
The straw that breaks my back

1461
01:42:47,092 --> 01:42:48,426
- I quit
- I quit

1462
01:42:48,594 --> 01:42:50,761
Unless you take it back

1463
01:42:50,929 --> 01:42:52,138
- Women
- Women

1464
01:42:52,306 --> 01:42:54,807
What is it about them?

1465
01:42:54,975 --> 01:43:00,521
- Can't live with them or without them
- Can't live with them or without them

1466
01:43:00,689 --> 01:43:04,275
- Take me for what I am
- Take me for what I am

1467
01:43:04,443 --> 01:43:08,487
- Who I was meant to be
- Who I was meant to be

1468
01:43:08,655 --> 01:43:11,282
- And if you give a damn
- And if you give a damn

1469
01:43:11,450 --> 01:43:13,784
You better take me, baby

1470
01:43:13,952 --> 01:43:16,120
- Oh, take me, baby
- Or leave me

1471
01:43:16,288 --> 01:43:18,664
Take me or leave me

1472
01:43:18,832 --> 01:43:25,046
- Take me, baby
- Take me, baby

1473
01:43:25,214 --> 01:43:30,635
- Or leave me
- Or leave me

1474
01:43:30,802 --> 01:43:32,970
- Guess I'm leaving
- Guess I'm leaving

1475
01:43:33,138 --> 01:43:35,848
- I'm gone
- I'm gone

1476
01:43:52,950 --> 01:43:59,121
In diapers, report cards
In spoked wheels, in speeding tickets

1477
01:43:59,289 --> 01:44:03,834
In contracts, dollars
In funerals, in births

1478
01:44:04,002 --> 01:44:09,090
In 525,600 minutes

1479
01:44:09,258 --> 01:44:14,262
How do you figure
A last year on Earth?

1480
01:44:14,429 --> 01:44:19,600
Figure in love

1481
01:44:19,768 --> 01:44:24,939
Figure in love

1482
01:44:25,107 --> 01:44:30,361
Figure in love

1483
01:44:30,529 --> 01:44:34,031
Measure in love

1484
01:44:34,199 --> 01:44:40,496
Seasons of love

1485
01:44:40,664 --> 01:44:47,461
Seasons of love

1486
01:44:50,757 --> 01:44:51,924
- Where were you?
- Sorry.

1487
01:44:52,092 --> 01:44:55,886
No, you lost your keys.
No, you went for a walk.

1488
01:44:56,054 --> 01:44:58,639
Had to help your mother.

1489
01:44:59,057 --> 01:45:00,891
- How's Benny?
- Baby-

1490
01:45:01,059 --> 01:45:03,144
- I'm working upstairs tonight.
- Wait.

1491
01:45:03,312 --> 01:45:06,355
I should tell you
I should-

1492
01:45:08,358 --> 01:45:10,234
Never mind.

1493
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:14,739
Happy Spring.

1494
01:45:30,422 --> 01:45:33,049
Without you

1495
01:45:34,301 --> 01:45:36,927
The ground thaws

1496
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:41,599
The rain falls

1497
01:45:42,059 --> 01:45:44,852
The grass grows

1498
01:45:45,937 --> 01:45:49,940
Without you

1499
01:45:50,108 --> 01:45:53,444
The seeds root

1500
01:45:53,612 --> 01:45:56,781
The flowers bloom

1501
01:45:57,949 --> 01:46:01,494
The children play

1502
01:46:01,661 --> 01:46:05,748
The stars gleam

1503
01:46:05,916 --> 01:46:09,543
The poets dream

1504
01:46:09,711 --> 01:46:14,632
The eagles fly

1505
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,801
Without you

1506
01:46:16,968 --> 01:46:21,430
The Earth turns

1507
01:46:21,598 --> 01:46:25,267
The sun burns

1508
01:46:25,435 --> 01:46:32,441
But I die without you

1509
01:46:37,489 --> 01:46:40,825
Without you

1510
01:46:40,992 --> 01:46:44,995
The breeze warms

1511
01:46:45,163 --> 01:46:48,707
The girl smiles

1512
01:46:48,875 --> 01:46:52,837
The cloud moves

1513
01:46:53,004 --> 01:46:56,924
Without you

1514
01:46:57,092 --> 01:47:00,678
The tides change

1515
01:47:00,846 --> 01:47:04,682
The boys run

1516
01:47:04,850 --> 01:47:08,561
The oceans crash

1517
01:47:08,728 --> 01:47:12,565
The crowds roar

1518
01:47:12,732 --> 01:47:16,527
The days soar

1519
01:47:16,695 --> 01:47:21,407
The babies cry

1520
01:47:21,575 --> 01:47:23,826
Without you

1521
01:47:23,994 --> 01:47:28,372
The moon glows

1522
01:47:28,582 --> 01:47:32,209
The river flows

1523
01:47:32,377 --> 01:47:39,383
But I die without you

1524
01:47:41,178 --> 01:47:44,722
The world revives

1525
01:47:44,890 --> 01:47:48,726
Colors renew

1526
01:47:48,894 --> 01:47:52,104
- But I know blue
- But I know blue

1527
01:47:52,272 --> 01:47:55,900
- Only blue
- Only blue

1528
01:47:56,067 --> 01:48:00,738
- Lonely blue
- Lonely blue

1529
01:48:00,906 --> 01:48:07,912
Within me, blue

1530
01:48:08,788 --> 01:48:12,583
Without you

1531
01:48:14,961 --> 01:48:17,922
Without you

1532
01:48:18,757 --> 01:48:22,051
The hand gropes

1533
01:48:22,802 --> 01:48:26,597
The ear hears

1534
01:48:26,765 --> 01:48:30,309
The pulse beats

1535
01:48:30,477 --> 01:48:34,313
Without you

1536
01:48:34,481 --> 01:48:38,526
The eyes gaze

1537
01:48:38,693 --> 01:48:42,530
The legs walk

1538
01:48:42,697 --> 01:48:46,033
The lungs breathe

1539
01:48:46,785 --> 01:48:50,246
- The mind churns
- The mind churns

1540
01:48:50,413 --> 01:48:54,124
- The heart yearns
- The heart yearns

1541
01:48:54,292 --> 01:48:58,337
- The tears dry
- The tears dry

1542
01:48:58,505 --> 01:49:01,549
- Without you
- Without you

1543
01:49:01,716 --> 01:49:05,636
- Life goes on
- Life goes on

1544
01:49:05,804 --> 01:49:10,015
- But I'm gone
- But I'm gone

1545
01:49:10,183 --> 01:49:17,189
- 'Cause I die without you
- 'Cause I die

1546
01:49:17,941 --> 01:49:21,902
Without you

1547
01:49:22,070 --> 01:49:24,989
Without you

1548
01:49:25,156 --> 01:49:30,995
- Without you
- Without you

1549
01:49:40,338 --> 01:49:42,172
- Speak.
- Speak.

1550
01:49:42,340 --> 01:49:47,011
Mark Cohen, Alexi Darling
Labor Day weekend in East Hampton

1551
01:49:47,178 --> 01:49:49,013
On the beach

1552
01:49:49,306 --> 01:49:54,101
Just saw Alec Baldwin
Told him you said hi

1553
01:49:54,269 --> 01:49:55,894
Just kidding

1554
01:49:56,062 --> 01:49:57,813
We need directors
You still need money

1555
01:49:57,981 --> 01:49:59,857
You know you need money
Pick up the phone

1556
01:50:00,025 --> 01:50:04,028
Don't be afraid of ker-ching, ker-ching

1557
01:50:04,195 --> 01:50:10,200
Marky, sell us your soul

1558
01:50:10,619 --> 01:50:14,913
Just kidding
We're waiting

1559
01:50:19,419 --> 01:50:22,254
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1560
01:50:22,422 --> 01:50:24,256
Yeah, right there.

1561
01:50:24,424 --> 01:50:28,302
- You got it.
- Oh, you're gonna make me come.

1562
01:50:28,470 --> 01:50:31,430
Yeah, right there. Keep doing that.

1563
01:50:32,557 --> 01:50:34,558
Oh, yeah.

1564
01:50:34,726 --> 01:50:38,228
Hot, hot, hot, sweat, sweet

1565
01:50:38,396 --> 01:50:42,232
Wet, wet, wet, red heat

1566
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:45,736
Hot, hot, hot, sweat, sweet

1567
01:50:45,904 --> 01:50:49,948
Wet, wet, wet, red heat

1568
01:50:50,116 --> 01:50:53,452
Please, don't stop, please
Please, don't stop, stop

1569
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:56,580
Stop, stop, stop
Please, please

1570
01:50:56,748 --> 01:50:57,915
- Please
- Harder

1571
01:50:58,083 --> 01:50:59,583
- Faster
- Wetter

1572
01:51:00,752 --> 01:51:02,586
- Bastard
- You whore

1573
01:51:02,754 --> 01:51:05,255
- More
- You animal

1574
01:51:05,423 --> 01:51:09,259
- Sticky, licky, trickle, tickle
- Fluid, no fluid, no contact, yes

1575
01:51:09,427 --> 01:51:12,763
- Steamy, creamy, stroking, soaking
- Fire, fire, burn, burn

1576
01:51:13,515 --> 01:51:16,767
No latex rubber, rubber

1577
01:51:16,935 --> 01:51:21,146
Fire, latex rubber, latex bummer
Lover bummer

1578
01:51:27,779 --> 01:51:34,785
Take me, take me, take me

1579
01:51:39,999 --> 01:51:44,962
Take me, take me
Today for you

1580
01:51:45,130 --> 01:51:48,757
Tomorrow for me
Today me

1581
01:51:48,925 --> 01:51:52,261
Tomorrow you
Tomorrow you

1582
01:51:52,429 --> 01:51:59,435
Love you, love, love you
Love you, I love you

1583
01:51:59,811 --> 01:52:04,064
I love you
Take me, take me, take me

1584
01:52:04,482 --> 01:52:07,401
Take me, yeah

1585
01:52:07,569 --> 01:52:08,610
- Wait
- Slipped

1586
01:52:08,778 --> 01:52:10,279
- Shit
- Where'd it go?

1587
01:52:10,447 --> 01:52:11,822
- Safe
- Damn

1588
01:52:11,990 --> 01:52:15,242
I think I missed
Don't get pissed

1589
01:52:15,410 --> 01:52:18,495
It was bad for me
Was it bad for you?

1590
01:52:18,663 --> 01:52:20,497
- It's over
- It's over

1591
01:52:20,665 --> 01:52:22,249
- It's over
- It's over

1592
01:52:24,961 --> 01:52:26,754
It's over.

1593
01:52:41,978 --> 01:52:45,063
Angel was one of my closest friends.

1594
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:50,027
It's right that it's Halloween
because it was her favorite holiday.

1595
01:52:50,403 --> 01:52:52,696
I knew we'd hit it off
the moment we met.

1596
01:52:52,864 --> 01:52:55,032
That skinhead was bothering her...

1597
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:58,285
...and she said she was more of a man
than he'd ever be...

1598
01:52:58,453 --> 01:53:01,705
...and more of a woman
than he'd ever get.

1599
01:53:02,707 --> 01:53:04,208
And then there was a time...

1600
01:53:04,375 --> 01:53:07,377
...he walked up
to this group of tourists...

1601
01:53:07,545 --> 01:53:09,922
...and they were petrified...

1602
01:53:10,089 --> 01:53:12,633
...because, A, they were
obviously lost...

1603
01:53:12,801 --> 01:53:17,846
...and, B, had probably never spoken
to a drag queen before in their lives.

1604
01:53:18,014 --> 01:53:19,723
And he...

1605
01:53:20,892 --> 01:53:22,059
She...

1606
01:53:22,227 --> 01:53:26,063
...just offered to escort them
out of Alphabet City...

1607
01:53:26,231 --> 01:53:28,899
...and then she let them
take a picture with her...

1608
01:53:29,067 --> 01:53:32,402
...and then she said she'd help them
find the Circle Line.

1609
01:53:33,905 --> 01:53:37,074
So much more original
than any of us.

1610
01:53:37,909 --> 01:53:41,370
You'd find an old tablecloth
on the street and make a dress...

1611
01:53:41,538 --> 01:53:42,996
...and next year,
sure enough...

1612
01:53:43,164 --> 01:53:45,582
...they'd be mass-producing
them at the Gap.

1613
01:53:48,711 --> 01:53:52,172
You always said how lucky
you were that we were all friends...

1614
01:53:54,217 --> 01:53:55,509
...but it was us, baby...

1615
01:53:55,677 --> 01:53:58,220
...who were the lucky ones.

1616
01:54:04,853 --> 01:54:09,398
Live in my house

1617
01:54:11,109 --> 01:54:14,194
I'll be your shelter

1618
01:54:15,780 --> 01:54:20,242
Just pay me back

1619
01:54:21,828 --> 01:54:27,833
With 1000 kisses

1620
01:54:29,210 --> 01:54:35,007
Be my lover

1621
01:54:37,468 --> 01:54:44,474
And I'll cover you

1622
01:54:48,855 --> 01:54:51,815
Open your door

1623
01:54:51,983 --> 01:54:54,818
I'll be your tenant

1624
01:54:54,986 --> 01:55:00,991
Don't got much baggage
To lay at your feet

1625
01:55:01,159 --> 01:55:05,579
But sweet kisses I've got to spare

1626
01:55:05,747 --> 01:55:12,753
I'll be there and I'll cover you

1627
01:55:14,422 --> 01:55:19,676
I think they meant it
When they said you can't buy love

1628
01:55:19,844 --> 01:55:26,475
Now I know you can rent it
A new lease you are, my love

1629
01:55:26,643 --> 01:55:29,144
On life

1630
01:55:29,729 --> 01:55:36,735
All my life

1631
01:55:37,528 --> 01:55:41,531
I've longed to discover

1632
01:55:41,699 --> 01:55:48,497
Something as true as this is

1633
01:55:48,665 --> 01:55:52,709
So with a thousand sweet kisses

1634
01:55:52,877 --> 01:55:57,130
If you're cold and you're lonely

1635
01:55:57,298 --> 01:55:59,216
With a thousand sweet kisses

1636
01:55:59,384 --> 01:56:02,052
- You've got one nickel only
- I'll cover you

1637
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:04,721
With a thousand sweet kisses

1638
01:56:04,889 --> 01:56:08,475
- When you're worn-out and tired
- I'll cover you

1639
01:56:08,643 --> 01:56:10,894
With a thousand sweet kisses

1640
01:56:11,062 --> 01:56:15,315
When your heart has expired

1641
01:56:15,483 --> 01:56:20,028
Oh, lover

1642
01:56:20,196 --> 01:56:22,698
- I'll cover you
- Yes, I will

1643
01:56:22,865 --> 01:56:24,241
- Yes, I will
- Yes, I will

1644
01:56:24,409 --> 01:56:27,327
Oh, yes, I will

1645
01:56:27,495 --> 01:56:32,290
Oh, lover

1646
01:56:32,458 --> 01:56:39,464
I'll cover you

1647
01:56:40,091 --> 01:56:42,551
Five hundred twenty-five thousand

1648
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:49,725
Seasons of

1649
01:56:51,811 --> 01:56:58,817
- Love
- I will cover you

1650
01:57:17,253 --> 01:57:20,964
Hi, it's Mark Cohen.
Is Alexi there?

1651
01:57:21,716 --> 01:57:22,758
No need to bother her.

1652
01:57:22,925 --> 01:57:25,844
Just let her know I'm running
a little late for my appointment.

1653
01:57:26,012 --> 01:57:28,180
I'm at my...

1654
01:57:28,973 --> 01:57:31,975
Yes, I'll still be there.

1655
01:57:32,143 --> 01:57:35,645
Yes, I signed the contract.

1656
01:57:35,813 --> 01:57:37,355
Thanks.

1657
01:57:40,860 --> 01:57:44,488
How did we get here?
How the hell?

1658
01:57:44,655 --> 01:57:50,410
Pan left
Close on the steeple of the church

1659
01:57:52,330 --> 01:57:56,708
How did I get here?
How the hell?

1660
01:57:56,876 --> 01:58:02,172
Christmas
Christmas Eve last year

1661
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:07,844
How could a night so frozen
Be so scalding hot?

1662
01:58:08,262 --> 01:58:12,390
How can a morning this mild
Be so raw?

1663
01:58:14,268 --> 01:58:19,523
Why are entire years strewn
On the cutting-room floor of memory

1664
01:58:19,690 --> 01:58:22,526
When single frames
From one magic night

1665
01:58:22,693 --> 01:58:24,861
Forever flicker in close-up

1666
01:58:25,029 --> 01:58:29,699
On the 3-D Imax of my mind?

1667
01:58:29,867 --> 01:58:33,620
That's poetic
That's pathetic

1668
01:58:33,788 --> 01:58:38,834
Why did Mimi knock on Roger's door
And Collins choose that phone booth

1669
01:58:39,001 --> 01:58:41,670
Back where Angel set up his drums?

1670
01:58:41,838 --> 01:58:44,381
Why did Maureen's equipment
Break down?

1671
01:58:44,549 --> 01:58:47,551
Why am I the witness?

1672
01:58:47,718 --> 01:58:52,556
And when I capture it on film
Will it mean that it's the end

1673
01:58:52,723 --> 01:58:57,853
And I'm alone?

1674
01:59:02,859 --> 01:59:07,654
It's true you sold your guitar
And bought a car?

1675
01:59:07,822 --> 01:59:11,700
It's true
I'm leaving now for Santa Fe

1676
01:59:11,868 --> 01:59:14,578
It's true you're with
This yuppie scum?

1677
01:59:14,745 --> 01:59:19,166
You said you'd never
Speak to him again

1678
01:59:19,333 --> 01:59:23,211
- Not now
- Who said that you have any say

1679
01:59:23,379 --> 01:59:26,256
- In who she says things to at all?
- Yeah.

1680
01:59:26,424 --> 01:59:30,260
Who said that you should stick
Your nose in other people-?

1681
01:59:30,428 --> 01:59:31,970
Who said I was talking to you?

1682
01:59:32,138 --> 01:59:34,931
- We used to have this fight each night
- Calm down

1683
01:59:35,099 --> 01:59:37,642
- She'd never admit I existed
- Everyone, please

1684
01:59:37,810 --> 01:59:39,686
He was the same way
He was always

1685
01:59:39,854 --> 01:59:42,439
Run away, hit the road, don't commit
You're full of shit

1686
01:59:42,607 --> 01:59:45,358
- She's in denial
- He's in denial

1687
01:59:45,526 --> 01:59:48,778
Didn't give an inch
When I gave a mile

1688
01:59:48,946 --> 01:59:51,615
- I gave a mile
- Gave a mile to who?

1689
01:59:51,782 --> 01:59:54,117
- Don't you dare come at me.
- Come on, guys, chill.

1690
01:59:54,285 --> 01:59:58,955
I'd be happy to die
For a taste of what Angel had

1691
01:59:59,123 --> 02:00:00,999
- Someone to live for
- Someone to live for

1692
02:00:01,167 --> 02:00:04,961
- Unafraid to say, "I love you"
- Unafraid to say, "I love you"

1693
02:00:05,129 --> 02:00:08,882
All your words are nice, Mimi

1694
02:00:09,050 --> 02:00:10,800
But love's not a three-way street

1695
02:00:10,968 --> 02:00:12,928
You'll never share real love

1696
02:00:13,095 --> 02:00:15,972
Until you love yourself
I should know

1697
02:00:16,140 --> 02:00:18,975
You all said you'd be cool today

1698
02:00:19,143 --> 02:00:23,563
So please, for my sake

1699
02:00:24,565 --> 02:00:27,275
I can't believe he's gone

1700
02:00:27,443 --> 02:00:30,237
I can't believe you're going

1701
02:00:30,404 --> 02:00:34,866
I can't believe this family must die

1702
02:00:35,034 --> 02:00:38,161
Angel helped us believe in love

1703
02:00:38,329 --> 02:00:40,497
I can't believe you disagree

1704
02:00:43,084 --> 02:00:48,672
I can't believe this is

1705
02:00:48,839 --> 02:00:54,552
Goodbye

1706
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:56,513
- Pookie.
- Honey bear.

1707
02:00:56,681 --> 02:00:58,390
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you.

1708
02:00:58,557 --> 02:01:01,351
- I missed your smell.
- I missed your mouth.

1709
02:01:03,688 --> 02:01:05,021
- What?
- Nothing, Pookie.

1710
02:01:05,189 --> 02:01:07,607
No. No, baby, you said, "Ow. "
What is it?

1711
02:01:07,775 --> 02:01:09,276
You bit my tongue.

1712
02:01:09,443 --> 02:01:11,027
- No, I didn't.
- Yes. It's bleeding.

1713
02:01:11,195 --> 02:01:12,279
I think I should know.

1714
02:01:12,446 --> 02:01:15,031
- Let me see. I was just try-
- She doesn't believe me.

1715
02:01:22,665 --> 02:01:24,624
Thomas B. Collins?

1716
02:01:25,251 --> 02:01:26,876
Coming.

1717
02:01:41,892 --> 02:01:45,061
I hear there are great restaurants
Out West

1718
02:01:45,229 --> 02:01:47,480
Some of the best
How could she?

1719
02:01:47,648 --> 02:01:50,066
How could you let her go?

1720
02:01:50,234 --> 02:01:54,654
You just don't know
How could we lose Angel?

1721
02:01:54,822 --> 02:01:59,409
Maybe you'll see why
When you stop escaping your pain

1722
02:01:59,577 --> 02:02:04,956
At least now if you try
Angel's death won't be in vain

1723
02:02:05,458 --> 02:02:09,169
His death is in vain

1724
02:02:10,588 --> 02:02:12,213
Are you insane?

1725
02:02:12,757 --> 02:02:16,426
There's so much to care about
There's me, there's Mimi

1726
02:02:16,594 --> 02:02:18,428
Mimi's got her baggage too

1727
02:02:18,596 --> 02:02:20,597
So do you

1728
02:02:21,015 --> 02:02:24,100
Who are you to tell me
What I know and what to do?

1729
02:02:24,268 --> 02:02:29,773
- A friend
- But who, Mark, are you?

1730
02:02:30,441 --> 02:02:32,567
"Mark has got his work"

1731
02:02:32,777 --> 02:02:37,614
They say, "Mark lives for his work"
And, "Mark's in love with his work"

1732
02:02:37,782 --> 02:02:40,658
- Mark hides in his work
- From what?

1733
02:02:40,826 --> 02:02:45,997
From facing your failure
Facing your loneliness

1734
02:02:46,165 --> 02:02:50,960
Facing the fact you live a lie

1735
02:02:51,712 --> 02:02:56,174
Yes, you live a lie
Tell you why

1736
02:02:56,342 --> 02:02:58,760
You're always preaching
Not to be numb

1737
02:02:58,928 --> 02:03:00,804
When that's how you thrive

1738
02:03:00,971 --> 02:03:03,223
You pretend to create and observe

1739
02:03:03,391 --> 02:03:06,434
When you really detach
From feeling alive

1740
02:03:06,602 --> 02:03:11,898
Perhaps it's because
I'm the one of us to survive

1741
02:03:12,066 --> 02:03:14,109
Poor baby!

1742
02:03:18,114 --> 02:03:20,490
Mimi still loves Roger

1743
02:03:20,658 --> 02:03:25,328
Is Roger really jealous
Or afraid that Mimi's weak?

1744
02:03:26,038 --> 02:03:27,705
Mimi did look pale

1745
02:03:27,873 --> 02:03:29,833
Mimi's gotten thin

1746
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,837
Mimi's running out of time
Roger's running out the door

1747
02:03:34,004 --> 02:03:39,300
No more
Oh, no, I gotta go

1748
02:03:39,468 --> 02:03:43,054
Hey, for someone
Who's always been let down

1749
02:03:43,222 --> 02:03:45,432
Who's heading out of town?

1750
02:03:45,683 --> 02:03:48,351
For someone who longs
For a community of his own

1751
02:03:48,519 --> 02:03:50,311
Who's with his camera, alone?

1752
02:03:54,733 --> 02:03:56,443
I'll call

1753
02:03:58,529 --> 02:04:00,530
I hate the fall

1754
02:04:03,826 --> 02:04:05,618
You heard?

1755
02:04:06,912 --> 02:04:09,622
Every word

1756
02:04:15,796 --> 02:04:21,050
You don't want baggage
Without lifetime guarantees

1757
02:04:21,218 --> 02:04:26,556
You don't want to watch me die
I just came to say

1758
02:04:26,724 --> 02:04:31,227
Goodbye, love
Goodbye, love

1759
02:04:31,395 --> 02:04:37,066
Came to say goodbye, love
Goodbye

1760
02:04:37,234 --> 02:04:38,818
Just came to say

1761
02:04:38,986 --> 02:04:40,904
- Goodbye, love
- Glory

1762
02:04:41,071 --> 02:04:43,740
- Goodbye, love
- One blaze of glory

1763
02:04:43,908 --> 02:04:47,243
Came to say goodbye, love

1764
02:04:47,495 --> 02:04:51,080
- Goodbye
- I have to find

1765
02:04:55,294 --> 02:04:57,837
Please don't touch me
Understand

1766
02:04:58,005 --> 02:05:00,590
I'm scared
I need to go away

1767
02:05:00,758 --> 02:05:02,759
- I know a place, a clinic
- A rehab?

1768
02:05:02,927 --> 02:05:04,260
Maybe
Could you?

1769
02:05:04,428 --> 02:05:06,095
I'll pay

1770
02:05:06,263 --> 02:05:11,267
Goodbye, love
Goodbye, love

1771
02:05:11,435 --> 02:05:16,731
Came to say goodbye, love
Goodbye

1772
02:05:16,899 --> 02:05:20,568
Just came to say
Goodbye, love

1773
02:05:20,736 --> 02:05:27,283
Goodbye, love
Goodbye, love

1774
02:05:28,118 --> 02:05:32,288
Hello, disease

1775
02:05:36,835 --> 02:05:39,837
Off the premises now
We give no handouts here

1776
02:05:40,005 --> 02:05:43,800
- What happened to "rest in peace"?
- Off the premises, queer

1777
02:05:43,968 --> 02:05:46,636
That's no way to send a boy
To meet his maker

1778
02:05:46,804 --> 02:05:49,305
They had to know
We couldn't pay the undertaker

1779
02:05:50,307 --> 02:05:52,809
Don't you worry about him
Hey, I'll take care of it

1780
02:05:53,811 --> 02:05:56,813
- Must be nice to have money.
- No shit.

1781
02:05:56,981 --> 02:05:58,648
I think it only fair to tell you...

1782
02:05:58,816 --> 02:06:01,859
...you just paid for the funeral
of the person who killed your dog.

1783
02:06:02,027 --> 02:06:07,073
I know. I always hated that dog.
Let's pay him off and then get drunk.

1784
02:06:07,241 --> 02:06:08,950
I can't. I have a meeting.

1785
02:06:09,118 --> 02:06:11,578
- Punk. Let's go.
- Punk. Let's go.

1786
02:06:13,664 --> 02:06:18,334
Hi. Mark Cohen here for Buzzline.
Back to you, Alexi.

1787
02:06:19,003 --> 02:06:22,088
Coming up next, vampire
welfare queens...

1788
02:06:22,256 --> 02:06:25,675
...who are compulsive bowlers.

1789
02:06:26,719 --> 02:06:30,888
Oh, my God. What am I doing?

1790
02:06:31,515 --> 02:06:34,267
Don't breathe too deep

1791
02:06:35,019 --> 02:06:38,062
Don't think all day

1792
02:06:38,230 --> 02:06:40,815
Dive into work

1793
02:06:41,692 --> 02:06:45,236
Drive the other way

1794
02:06:45,404 --> 02:06:48,323
That drip of hurt

1795
02:06:48,490 --> 02:06:51,826
That pint of shame

1796
02:06:51,994 --> 02:06:57,540
Goes away
Just play the game

1797
02:06:57,750 --> 02:07:00,835
You're living in America

1798
02:07:01,045 --> 02:07:04,547
At the end of the millennium

1799
02:07:04,715 --> 02:07:07,800
You're living in America

1800
02:07:07,968 --> 02:07:10,970
Leave your conscience at the tone

1801
02:07:11,138 --> 02:07:14,682
And when you're living in America

1802
02:07:14,850 --> 02:07:19,562
At the end of the millennium

1803
02:07:22,149 --> 02:07:26,444
You're what you own

1804
02:07:26,612 --> 02:07:29,113
The filmmaker cannot see

1805
02:07:29,281 --> 02:07:32,909
And the songwriter cannot hear

1806
02:07:33,077 --> 02:07:36,245
Yet I see Mimi everywhere

1807
02:07:36,413 --> 02:07:40,083
Angel's voice is in my ear

1808
02:07:40,250 --> 02:07:42,585
Just tighten those shoulders

1809
02:07:42,753 --> 02:07:46,422
Just clench your jaw till you frown

1810
02:07:46,590 --> 02:07:47,924
Just don't let go

1811
02:07:48,092 --> 02:07:52,428
- Or you may drown
- Or you may drown

1812
02:07:52,596 --> 02:07:55,640
- You're living in America
- You're living in America

1813
02:07:55,808 --> 02:07:59,227
- At the end of the millennium
- At the end of the millennium

1814
02:07:59,395 --> 02:08:02,271
- You're living in America
- You're living in America

1815
02:08:02,439 --> 02:08:05,650
- Where it's like The Twilight Zone
- Where it's like The Twilight Zone

1816
02:08:05,859 --> 02:08:09,445
- And when you're living in America
- And when you're living in America

1817
02:08:09,613 --> 02:08:14,784
- At the end of the millennium
- At the end of the millennium

1818
02:08:16,787 --> 02:08:20,707
- You're what you own
- You're what you own

1819
02:08:20,874 --> 02:08:23,835
- So I own not a notion
- So I own not a notion

1820
02:08:24,002 --> 02:08:27,755
- I escape and ape content
- I escape and ape content

1821
02:08:27,923 --> 02:08:30,800
- I don't own emotion
- I don't own emotion

1822
02:08:30,968 --> 02:08:34,679
- I rent
- I rent

1823
02:08:34,847 --> 02:08:41,310
- What was it about that night?
- What was it about that night?

1824
02:08:41,478 --> 02:08:48,192
- Connection in an isolating age
- Connection in an isolating age

1825
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:51,988
- For once the shadows
- For once the shadows

1826
02:08:52,156 --> 02:08:55,074
- Gave way to light
- Gave way to light

1827
02:08:55,242 --> 02:09:01,831
- For once I didn't disengage
- For once I didn't disengage

1828
02:09:02,249 --> 02:09:05,460
- Angel, I hear you, I hear it, I see it
- Mimi, I see you

1829
02:09:05,627 --> 02:09:09,172
- I see it, my film
- I see it, I hear it, I hear it, my song

1830
02:09:09,339 --> 02:09:12,383
- Alexi, Mark. Call me a hypocrite...
- One song, glory

1831
02:09:12,551 --> 02:09:15,261
- ... I need to finish my own film. I quit.
- Mimi, your eyes

1832
02:09:15,429 --> 02:09:18,014
- Dying in America
- Dying in America

1833
02:09:18,182 --> 02:09:21,726
- At the end of the millennium
- At the end of the millennium

1834
02:09:21,935 --> 02:09:25,021
- We're dying in America
- We're dying in America

1835
02:09:25,189 --> 02:09:28,065
- To come into our own
- To come into our own

1836
02:09:28,233 --> 02:09:31,861
- And when you're dying in America
- And when you're dying in America

1837
02:09:32,029 --> 02:09:36,866
- At the end of the millennium
- At the end of the millennium

1838
02:09:39,036 --> 02:09:45,583
- You're not alone
- You're not alone

1839
02:09:45,959 --> 02:09:52,381
- I'm not alone
- I'm not alone

1840
02:09:52,549 --> 02:09:59,555
- I'm not alone
- I'm not alone

1841
02:10:11,902 --> 02:10:13,778
- Speak.
- Speak.

1842
02:10:13,946 --> 02:10:17,782
Roger, this is your mother

1843
02:10:17,950 --> 02:10:21,577
Roger, honey
I don't get these postcards

1844
02:10:21,745 --> 02:10:24,080
"Moving to Santa Fe"
"Back in New York

1845
02:10:24,248 --> 02:10:26,082
Starting a rock band"

1846
02:10:26,250 --> 02:10:29,794
Roger, where are you?
Roger, where are you?

1847
02:10:29,962 --> 02:10:34,298
Roger, where are you?
Roger, where are you?

1848
02:10:35,259 --> 02:10:39,387
Kitten, wherever are you?

1849
02:10:39,555 --> 02:10:43,933
Kitten, wherever are you?

1850
02:10:44,101 --> 02:10:47,770
Kitten, wherever are you?

1851
02:10:47,938 --> 02:10:51,023
Mark, are you there? Are you there?
I don't know if-

1852
02:10:51,191 --> 02:10:54,277
Please

1853
02:10:54,444 --> 02:10:56,445
Call

1854
02:10:56,613 --> 02:11:01,909
Your mother

1855
02:11:10,460 --> 02:11:17,008
- Christmas bells are ringing
- Christmas bells are ringing

1856
02:11:17,175 --> 02:11:23,139
Christmas bells are ringing
How time flies

1857
02:11:23,307 --> 02:11:26,350
When compassion dies

1858
02:11:27,144 --> 02:11:33,357
No stockings, no candy canes
No gingerbread, no safety net

1859
02:11:33,525 --> 02:11:35,902
No loose change
No change, no

1860
02:11:36,069 --> 02:11:42,533
- Santy Claus is coming
- 'Cause Santy Claus ain't coming

1861
02:11:42,701 --> 02:11:48,706
No room at the Holiday Inn again

1862
02:11:48,874 --> 02:11:53,961
Well, maybe next year
Or when

1863
02:11:56,256 --> 02:12:00,217
December 24th, 10 p. m.
Eastern Standard Time

1864
02:12:00,385 --> 02:12:04,513
I can't believe a year
Went by so fast

1865
02:12:04,681 --> 02:12:07,516
Time to see
What we have time to see

1866
02:12:09,061 --> 02:12:10,728
Turn the projector on.

1867
02:12:10,896 --> 02:12:12,355
First shot, Roger

1868
02:12:12,522 --> 02:12:15,691
With the Fender guitar
He just got out of hock

1869
02:12:15,859 --> 02:12:19,695
When he sold the car
That took him away and back

1870
02:12:19,863 --> 02:12:21,030
I found my song

1871
02:12:21,198 --> 02:12:23,866
He found his song
If he could just find Mimi

1872
02:12:24,034 --> 02:12:26,953
I tried. You know I tried.

1873
02:12:27,120 --> 02:12:30,539
Fade in on Mark
Who's still in the dark

1874
02:12:30,707 --> 02:12:33,542
- But he's got great footage
- Which he's cut together

1875
02:12:33,710 --> 02:12:35,211
To screen tonight.

1876
02:12:35,379 --> 02:12:37,380
- In honor of Benny's wife
- Muffy

1877
02:12:37,965 --> 02:12:39,006
Allison

1878
02:12:39,174 --> 02:12:43,511
Pulling Benny
Out of the East Village location

1879
02:12:43,679 --> 02:12:47,181
Then again,
maybe we won't screen it tonight.

1880
02:12:47,349 --> 02:12:50,393
I wonder how Allison
found out about Mimi?

1881
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:52,061
Maybe a little bird told her.

1882
02:12:52,229 --> 02:12:54,271
Or an angel.

1883
02:12:54,439 --> 02:12:58,859
I had a little hunch
That you could use a little flow

1884
02:12:59,027 --> 02:13:01,195
- Tutoring again?
- Negative

1885
02:13:01,363 --> 02:13:03,239
- Back at NYU?
- No, no, no

1886
02:13:03,407 --> 02:13:07,284
I rewired the ATM
At The Food Emporium

1887
02:13:07,452 --> 02:13:11,956
To provide an honorarium
To anyone with the code

1888
02:13:12,124 --> 02:13:16,752
The code

1889
02:13:18,422 --> 02:13:19,463
- Well?
- Well?

1890
02:13:19,631 --> 02:13:23,259
A- N-G-E-L.

1891
02:13:23,427 --> 02:13:25,928
Yet Robin Hooding
Isn't the solution

1892
02:13:27,764 --> 02:13:31,726
The powers that be
Must be undermined where they dwell

1893
02:13:31,893 --> 02:13:36,480
In a small, exclusive
Gourmet institution

1894
02:13:36,648 --> 02:13:40,985
Where we overcharge
The wealthy clientele

1895
02:13:41,153 --> 02:13:45,614
Let's open up a restaurant
In Santa Fe

1896
02:13:45,782 --> 02:13:50,077
With a private corner banquette
In the back

1897
02:13:50,245 --> 02:13:54,582
We'll make it yet
We'll somehow get to Santa Fe

1898
02:13:54,791 --> 02:13:59,628
But you'd miss New York
Before you could unpack

1899
02:14:15,645 --> 02:14:20,941
Mark! Roger! Anyone, help!

1900
02:14:21,151 --> 02:14:23,486
- Maureen?
- It's Mimi!

1901
02:14:23,653 --> 02:14:26,155
We can't get her up the stairs!

1902
02:14:26,323 --> 02:14:28,491
No!

1903
02:14:32,954 --> 02:14:36,499
She was huddled in the park
In the dark

1904
02:14:37,417 --> 02:14:41,337
And she was freezing
And begged to come here

1905
02:14:41,505 --> 02:14:43,506
- Over here? Oh, God.
- Yeah.

1906
02:14:43,673 --> 02:14:48,928
Got a light? I know you
You're shivering

1907
02:14:49,096 --> 02:14:52,848
- She's been living on the street
- We need some heat

1908
02:14:53,016 --> 02:14:54,308
- I'm shivering.
- Okay.

1909
02:14:54,518 --> 02:14:58,771
We can buy some wood
And something to eat

1910
02:14:58,939 --> 02:15:02,775
I'm afraid she needs more than heat

1911
02:15:02,943 --> 02:15:04,860
I heard that

1912
02:15:05,028 --> 02:15:09,198
Collins will call for a doctor, honey

1913
02:15:09,366 --> 02:15:12,910
Don't waste your money on me

1914
02:15:13,078 --> 02:15:16,539
Hello, 911? I'm on hold.

1915
02:15:16,706 --> 02:15:21,877
Cold, cold
Would you light my candle?

1916
02:15:22,921 --> 02:15:26,882
Yes- Oh, God
Find a candle

1917
02:15:32,097 --> 02:15:35,766
I should tell you
I should tell you

1918
02:15:35,934 --> 02:15:39,395
I should tell you
I should tell you

1919
02:15:39,563 --> 02:15:45,109
I should tell you
Benny wasn't anything-

1920
02:15:45,277 --> 02:15:47,403
I know

1921
02:15:47,571 --> 02:15:51,740
I should tell you why I left

1922
02:15:51,908 --> 02:15:55,077
- It wasn't 'cause I didn't-
- I know

1923
02:15:55,245 --> 02:15:59,081
- I should tell you
- I should tell you

1924
02:15:59,249 --> 02:16:05,421
I should tell you, I love you

1925
02:16:16,391 --> 02:16:19,476
Who do you think you are?

1926
02:16:20,562 --> 02:16:23,606
Leaving me alone with my guitar

1927
02:16:24,482 --> 02:16:27,818
Hold on, there's something
You should hear

1928
02:16:28,987 --> 02:16:33,824
It isn't much, but it took all year

1929
02:16:42,125 --> 02:16:44,418
Your eyes

1930
02:16:45,795 --> 02:16:50,466
As we said our goodbyes

1931
02:16:50,634 --> 02:16:54,637
Can't get them out of my mind

1932
02:16:54,804 --> 02:16:56,972
And I find

1933
02:16:57,140 --> 02:17:01,393
I can't hide

1934
02:17:02,145 --> 02:17:06,315
From your eyes

1935
02:17:06,483 --> 02:17:11,153
The ones that took me by surprise

1936
02:17:11,321 --> 02:17:15,157
The night you came into my life

1937
02:17:15,325 --> 02:17:17,451
Where there's moonlight

1938
02:17:17,619 --> 02:17:20,162
I see your eyes

1939
02:17:23,291 --> 02:17:27,169
How'd I let you slip away

1940
02:17:27,337 --> 02:17:32,675
When I'm longing so to hold you?

1941
02:17:32,842 --> 02:17:36,595
Now I'd die for one more day

1942
02:17:36,763 --> 02:17:41,016
'Cause there's something
I should have told you

1943
02:17:41,559 --> 02:17:46,897
Yes, there's something
I should have told you

1944
02:17:47,857 --> 02:17:52,361
When I looked into your eyes

1945
02:17:52,529 --> 02:17:56,699
Why does distance make us wise?

1946
02:17:56,866 --> 02:18:00,536
You were the song all along

1947
02:18:00,704 --> 02:18:07,710
And before this song dies

1948
02:18:08,545 --> 02:18:12,965
I should tell you
I should tell you

1949
02:18:13,508 --> 02:18:16,802
I have always loved you

1950
02:18:18,346 --> 02:18:25,060
You can see it in my eyes

1951
02:18:39,075 --> 02:18:46,081
Mimi

1952
02:19:06,936 --> 02:19:08,771
- I jumped over the moon.
- What?

1953
02:19:08,938 --> 02:19:11,774
A leap of:

1954
02:19:11,941 --> 02:19:13,817
She's back.

1955
02:19:14,569 --> 02:19:16,362
I was in a tunnel...

1956
02:19:16,529 --> 02:19:18,781
...headed for this warm, white light.

1957
02:19:18,948 --> 02:19:20,199
Oh, my God.

1958
02:19:20,367 --> 02:19:22,451
And I swear...

1959
02:19:22,619 --> 02:19:24,661
...Angel was there.

1960
02:19:24,829 --> 02:19:28,123
And she looked good.

1961
02:19:28,291 --> 02:19:30,459
And she said:

1962
02:19:30,627 --> 02:19:32,461
"Turn around, girlfriend...

1963
02:19:32,629 --> 02:19:36,173
...and listen to that boy's song. "

1964
02:19:36,341 --> 02:19:37,674
She's drenched.

1965
02:19:37,842 --> 02:19:41,929
Her fever's breaking

1966
02:19:42,097 --> 02:19:46,433
There is no future

1967
02:19:46,601 --> 02:19:50,646
There is no past

1968
02:19:50,814 --> 02:19:56,819
Thank God this moment's
Not the last

1969
02:19:58,196 --> 02:20:01,198
- There's only us
- There's only us

1970
02:20:01,366 --> 02:20:04,660
- There's only this
- There's only this

1971
02:20:04,828 --> 02:20:07,830
- Forget regret
- Forget regret

1972
02:20:07,997 --> 02:20:10,707
Or life is yours to miss

1973
02:20:10,875 --> 02:20:13,877
No other road

1974
02:20:14,045 --> 02:20:17,506
No other way

1975
02:20:17,674 --> 02:20:23,178
No day but today

1976
02:20:23,346 --> 02:20:28,684
- I can't control
- Will I lose my dignity?

1977
02:20:28,852 --> 02:20:35,774
- My destiny
- Will someone care?

1978
02:20:35,942 --> 02:20:39,361
- I trust my soul
- Will I wake tomorrow

1979
02:20:39,529 --> 02:20:41,363
My only goal

1980
02:20:41,531 --> 02:20:47,369
- Is just to be
- From this nightmare?

1981
02:20:47,537 --> 02:20:50,914
- Without you
- There's only now

1982
02:20:51,082 --> 02:20:53,292
- The hand gropes
- There's only here

1983
02:20:53,460 --> 02:20:56,712
- The ear hears
- Give in to love

1984
02:20:56,880 --> 02:20:59,923
- The pulse beats
- Or live in fear

1985
02:21:00,091 --> 02:21:02,426
- Life goes on
- No other path

1986
02:21:02,594 --> 02:21:06,054
- But I'm gone
- No other way

1987
02:21:06,222 --> 02:21:12,519
- 'Cause I die without you
- No day but today

1988
02:21:12,729 --> 02:21:18,859
- I die without you
- No day but today

1989
02:21:19,027 --> 02:21:25,199
- I die without you
- No day but today

1990
02:21:25,366 --> 02:21:31,538
- I die without you
- No day but today

1991
02:21:31,706 --> 02:21:38,170
- I die without you
- No day but today

1992
02:21:38,338 --> 02:21:43,926
- I die without you
- No day but today

1993
02:21:46,888 --> 02:21:53,477
No day but today

1994
02:23:07,510 --> 02:23:12,014
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

1995
02:23:12,932 --> 02:23:18,061
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Moments so dear

1996
02:23:18,229 --> 02:23:23,025
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

1997
02:23:23,484 --> 02:23:28,697
How do you measure
Measure a year?

1998
02:23:28,865 --> 02:23:31,074
In daylights, in sunsets

1999
02:23:31,242 --> 02:23:34,453
In midnights, in cups of coffee

2000
02:23:34,621 --> 02:23:36,872
In inches, in miles

2001
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:39,458
In laughter, in strife

2002
02:23:39,626 --> 02:23:44,546
In 525,600 minutes

2003
02:23:44,714 --> 02:23:50,052
How do you measure
A year in the life?

2004
02:23:50,219 --> 02:23:55,307
How about love?

2005
02:23:55,475 --> 02:24:00,646
How about love?

2006
02:24:00,813 --> 02:24:06,234
How about love?

2007
02:24:06,402 --> 02:24:09,905
Measure in love

2008
02:24:10,073 --> 02:24:16,411
Seasons of love

2009
02:24:16,579 --> 02:24:22,417
Seasons of love

2010
02:24:23,002 --> 02:24:28,340
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

2011
02:24:28,508 --> 02:24:33,595
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Journeys to plan

2012
02:24:33,763 --> 02:24:38,100
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes

2013
02:24:38,267 --> 02:24:43,772
How do you measure
The life of a woman or a man?

2014
02:24:43,940 --> 02:24:49,778
In truths that she learned?
Or in times that he cried?

2015
02:24:49,946 --> 02:24:51,488
In bridges he burned?

2016
02:24:51,656 --> 02:24:57,119
- Or the way that she died?
- It's time now to sing out

2017
02:24:57,286 --> 02:24:59,871
Though the story never ends

2018
02:25:00,039 --> 02:25:05,127
Let's celebrate
Remember a year in the life of friends

2019
02:25:05,294 --> 02:25:08,463
Remember the love

2020
02:25:08,631 --> 02:25:12,801
Oh, you got to
You got to remember the love

2021
02:25:12,969 --> 02:25:17,139
You know that love is a gift
From up above

2022
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:22,561
Give love, give love, spread love

2023
02:25:22,729 --> 02:25:27,816
Measure, measure your life in love

2024
02:25:27,984 --> 02:25:33,155
Seasons of love

2025
02:25:33,656 --> 02:25:39,995
- Seasons of love
- Measure your life in love

2026
02:25:40,163 --> 02:25:44,708
With a thousand sweet kisses

2027
02:25:44,876 --> 02:25:50,172
With a thousand sweet kisses

2028
02:25:50,339 --> 02:25:54,509
With a thousand sweet kisses

2029
02:25:54,677 --> 02:25:59,514
With a thousand sweet kisses

2030
02:26:00,016 --> 02:26:02,350
How about

2031
02:26:02,852 --> 02:26:06,188
Love?

2032
02:26:06,355 --> 02:26:07,773
How about

2033
02:26:07,940 --> 02:26:11,443
Love?

2034
02:26:11,611 --> 02:26:12,736
How about

2035
02:26:12,904 --> 02:26:16,698
Love?

2036
02:26:16,866 --> 02:26:21,036
Measure in love

2037
02:26:21,204 --> 02:26:26,708
Seasons of love
