1
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,060
( Announcer ) And now, the Burtain
Phonograph Company brings you...

2
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:29,004
led Potter and his
"Off-The-Record"program.

3
00:01:29,106 --> 00:01:31,075
"Good evening.
This is Jed Potter...

4
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:34,009
"once more in his anecdotage,
so pull up a chair.

5
00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:37,480
"As I promised, we're going to
turn back some of the pages...

6
00:01:37,582 --> 00:01:40,016
"of Irving Berlin's
Album of Songs,

7
00:01:40,153 --> 00:01:45,056
"songs, that like footnotes to history,
reflect an epoch in American life.

8
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:48,720
"To most of us they bring back
a multitude of memories.

9
00:01:48,828 --> 00:01:52,492
"To me they bring back a story
which I'm going to relate tonight.

10
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,692
"And for a
very special reason.

11
00:01:54,803 --> 00:01:58,329
"It's an unfinished story
because the people in it are real,

12
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,274
"and real people have a way of
leaving their stories unfinished.

13
00:02:02,376 --> 00:02:04,311
"However, somewhere tonight...

14
00:02:04,412 --> 00:02:08,349
"there is one person who may be able
to give this story its proper ending.

15
00:02:08,483 --> 00:02:10,384
"I hope she's listening.

16
00:02:10,486 --> 00:02:15,014
"It all began early in that period
of peace between two world wars.

17
00:02:15,124 --> 00:02:17,957
"In one of the big shows on Broadway,
there was an Irving Berlin song...

18
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:21,656
"called, A Pretty Girl
Is Like A Melody.

19
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:25,462
"Incidentally, this is the
story of a pretty girl...

20
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:27,662
a very pretty girl. "

21
00:02:31,809 --> 00:02:36,678
Is like a melody

22
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:44,245
That haunts you
night and day

23
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:50,528
Just like the strain

24
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:55,192
Of a haunting refrain

25
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:59,705
She"ll start upon
a marathon

26
00:02:59,807 --> 00:03:03,072
And run around
your brain

27
00:03:03,177 --> 00:03:05,202
Don't worry!
Don't worry!

28
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:08,043
Sorry,Joe.

29
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:11,551
Last night, girls!
Anything goes.

30
00:03:11,653 --> 00:03:15,316
Last night or no last night, those
people paid for their tickets.

31
00:03:15,457 --> 00:03:18,426
Oh, c'mon, Mack.

32
00:03:19,294 --> 00:03:22,458
Mary!
Mary!

33
00:03:22,564 --> 00:03:24,590
She will leave you
( Mouthing words )

34
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,397
And then come back-

35
00:03:27,503 --> 00:03:29,404
That's a gorgeous thing,
Mack.

36
00:03:29,505 --> 00:03:33,602
No monkey business. No monkey
business. That's what I said.

37
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,610
Anybody that would-

38
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:38,408
Gosh, you're clumsy.
Oh, I'm on!

39
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:20,725
Hello. Don't forget.
we're going out tonight.

40
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,451
She will leave you
again

41
00:05:18,558 --> 00:05:20,719
Say, you're good.
You're crazy!

42
00:05:20,827 --> 00:05:24,491
Come back again

43
00:05:24,598 --> 00:05:30,129
Apretty girl is just
like a pretty tune

44
00:05:34,977 --> 00:05:37,344
( Applause )

45
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:39,641
Hear that?
C'mon.

46
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:48,455
Now you've arrived.
Oh, I'm scared to death.

47
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:51,323
Mary, you play your cards right
- C'mon, take a bow.

48
00:05:51,428 --> 00:05:53,328
Mary?
Yes, Mack.

49
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:56,923
why didn't you tell me you're leaving
the show, not going on the road?

50
00:05:57,034 --> 00:05:59,003
Did Jed Potter
tell you that?

51
00:05:59,136 --> 00:06:01,366
He says you're going with him
into the new Dillingham show.

52
00:06:01,505 --> 00:06:04,736
I'm sticking with this show. Comin' up.

53
00:06:04,843 --> 00:06:07,607
Mr. Potter! Ah, please call meJed.

54
00:06:07,713 --> 00:06:11,080
who gave you the right to
say I'm leaving the show?

55
00:06:11,183 --> 00:06:13,583
well, aren't you?
Jed.

56
00:06:13,686 --> 00:06:16,519
Don't you ever give up?
Not where you're concerned.

57
00:06:16,622 --> 00:06:20,581
I want to get you out of the chorus.
You could be a lead in a Broadway show.

58
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:22,992
You have talent.
Talent, hmm?

59
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:25,395
You've got great possibilities.
with a little coaching-

60
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:29,799
In your apartment? what?
well, Mary, what do you mean?

61
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:32,873
I've heard all about it.
Girls do talk, you know.

62
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:36,068
Are you gonna believe them or me? Them.

63
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,511
Thanks for the offer,
but I'm going on the road.

64
00:06:39,614 --> 00:06:41,514
Now, wait a minute!

65
00:06:44,953 --> 00:06:46,944
Mary, you're crazy!
I'd give my right arm...

66
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:50,220
to get an offer like that from
Jed. An arm wouldn't interest him.

67
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,761
Bubbles? Junior, what a surprise!

68
00:06:52,863 --> 00:06:54,762
It's all arranged.
what?

69
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:58,266
My man'll do your packing. You and
I are going to Dillingham's party.

70
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:00,267
No,Jed.
Good night.

71
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,270
I'll just have to
drive you home then.

72
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:04,341
Thanks. I can
walk there faster.

73
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:07,605
If you're in a hurry, we'll walk. Jed.

74
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:11,273
On my word of honor, I swear
I'll take you straight home...

75
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:13,316
after one little drink.

76
00:07:13,418 --> 00:07:16,251
All right, one drink.
where?

77
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:18,687
Oh,just
any old place.

78
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:24,755
Then you won't
want me, Mr. Potter?

79
00:07:24,864 --> 00:07:28,197
That's a difficult choice,
Jeffrey. Good night.

80
00:07:35,608 --> 00:07:38,009
Good evening, Mr. Potter. Hello,Jim.

81
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:42,815
Hello.
How are you?

82
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:47,112
Hi,Jed.
Hello,Johnny.

83
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:50,019
I got your message and I
held you a nice table for two.

84
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:52,685
Oh,just any old place, hmm? well-

85
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:56,196
Have I dropped somebody's hot potato
in somebody else's lap? You have.

86
00:07:56,299 --> 00:07:59,291
My first wrong move this
evening. I hasten to rectify it.

87
00:07:59,402 --> 00:08:03,339
Jed, dear boy, what a delightful
surprise having you drop in!

88
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,739
So unexpected! Oh, what
luck! Here's a table for two.

89
00:08:07,845 --> 00:08:10,177
Come along,
will you please?

90
00:08:12,382 --> 00:08:14,475
How you making out?
Oh, great!

91
00:08:16,254 --> 00:08:18,518
Happy hangover, kiddies. Thank you.

92
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,523
Here we are.

93
00:08:22,026 --> 00:08:24,655
Johnny, this is
- Waiter.!

94
00:08:24,763 --> 00:08:27,960
- where's the waiter?
- It's novelty night.

95
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:31,093
we're putting liquor in
the drinks. I'll be back.

96
00:08:31,203 --> 00:08:33,899
Is he an old friend?

97
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:36,736
we did a hitch
in the army together.

98
00:08:36,843 --> 00:08:38,834
Charming, isn't he?

99
00:08:38,946 --> 00:08:41,880
Let's have a little service.
I want a drink.

100
00:08:41,982 --> 00:08:44,645
Don't you think you've had
enough? If I think I had enough,

101
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:48,347
would I ask for more? You've
got a good point. Hey, Tony!

102
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:50,957
This gentleman
would like a drink.

103
00:08:51,092 --> 00:08:54,460
- Number 12.
- Number 12.

104
00:08:54,562 --> 00:08:57,054
The Frankenstein Special!

105
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:03,868
well, come on, make
it snappy! Shh. Quiet.

106
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:06,532
You want to wake up the waiters? lohnny?

107
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,690
Ooh!

108
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:26,663
Now, what was it
you wanted?

109
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:29,790
Oh! I wanted-
( Stuttering )

110
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:32,870
I wanna
get out of here!

111
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,367
Here, stay on your feet.
You'll get a draw.

112
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,307
AmaZing, isn"t it? That boy must
be a relative of the bartender.

113
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,216
Johnny, take a look at
this girl. Thank you.

114
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,220
I like looking
at her.

115
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:54,625
wouldn't you say there's a brain
in that head? I'll check. May I?

116
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,061
I'd say in the back of those pretty
blue eyes is an attractive brain.

117
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,794
Thank you, sir. I had
the same impression.

118
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:04,566
But we're wrong. She
- Do you mind if I speak for myself?

119
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:08,574
Not just now, dear. I've offered to
get her a spot in Dillingham's new show.

120
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:11,737
She turned it down. Ask him
why he wants me in the show.

121
00:10:11,847 --> 00:10:15,682
I shall do that just for you. why do
you want this young lady in the show?

122
00:10:15,784 --> 00:10:18,185
It's a chance to get her
out of the chorus-

123
00:10:18,288 --> 00:10:22,054
Oh, I see...
an interest in her career.

124
00:10:22,158 --> 00:10:25,821
That's nice. why are you
rejecting Potter's offer?

125
00:10:25,962 --> 00:10:28,830
My mother told me never to
take presents from strange men.

126
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:31,868
Ah, her mother.

127
00:10:32,003 --> 00:10:35,302
Mary,Johnny's
known me for years.

128
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:38,569
Ask him if there's anything about
me a girl could possibly distrust.

129
00:10:38,677 --> 00:10:41,168
Can I speak freely?

130
00:10:43,548 --> 00:10:47,747
I forgot to tell you. He has a
fine, infantile sense of humor.

131
00:10:47,853 --> 00:10:49,754
Seriously,
am I right?

132
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:52,347
Of course you are.
The customer always is.

133
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,086
If you had one ounce
of ambition-

134
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:57,128
There's more than one kind
of ambition.

135
00:10:57,231 --> 00:11:00,598
A woman can be ambitious to be famous
or ambitious just to be a woman.

136
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:04,603
Listen to who's talking
about ambition!

137
00:11:04,738 --> 00:11:07,730
I, uh, don't ordinarily
admit it,

138
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,673
but this hillbilly and I were
once in Vaudeville together.

139
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:12,974
Shh. Not so loud.

140
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:15,174
when we got a chance
to play the Palace,

141
00:11:15,284 --> 00:11:18,275
he went to Louisville and
played a honky-tonk instead.

142
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:22,118
Do you know why he went?
Because he wanted to see a horse.

143
00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:26,891
I'll thank you to speak
more respectfully of Rosebud.

144
00:11:26,996 --> 00:11:30,194
Did he not win the Kentucky Derby
and buy me my first nightclub?

145
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,791
And at Belmont Park
did he not take it away?

146
00:11:32,936 --> 00:11:34,335
That he did.

147
00:11:34,438 --> 00:11:37,168
( Band ) I appear to be on.

148
00:11:37,307 --> 00:11:40,470
Couldn't sell you flapjacks,
southern-fried chicken? No, thanks, friend.

149
00:11:40,578 --> 00:11:42,705
we dropped in for a
drink. I'd like some.

150
00:11:42,814 --> 00:11:45,715
You shall have some after I
annoy the customers with a song.

151
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:48,082
will you stand by?

152
00:11:48,187 --> 00:11:51,645
I, uh, thought you were in a hurry. Hmm?

153
00:11:51,757 --> 00:11:55,090
Oh, I wasn't
hungry then.

154
00:11:58,164 --> 00:12:02,100
JohnnyJones was
a first-class private

155
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:05,502
In the army last year

156
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:09,200
Now he's back to business
in his father's place

157
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:13,143
Sunday night I saw him
with a smiling face

158
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:17,149
when I asked him
why he felt so happy

159
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:20,345
Johnny chuckled
with glee

160
00:12:20,455 --> 00:12:23,652
He winked his eye
and made this reply

161
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,126
Something wonderful's
happened to me

162
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:32,065
I got the guy
who used to be my captain

163
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:35,399
workin' for me

164
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,633
He wanted work
so I made him a clerk

165
00:12:38,742 --> 00:12:41,575
In my father's beanery

166
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:43,872
And by and by

167
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:49,543
I'm gonna have him wrapped
in work up to his brow

168
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:53,249
I make him open the office
every morning at 8:00

169
00:12:53,358 --> 00:12:56,919
He comes around
about four hours late

170
00:12:57,028 --> 00:13:00,589
It's great! Everything
comes to those who wait

171
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:05,136
I've got my captain
working for me now

172
00:13:05,237 --> 00:13:09,139
He's not worth
what I have to pay him

173
00:13:09,242 --> 00:13:12,335
Oh, I'll never complain

174
00:13:12,446 --> 00:13:16,007
I agreed to give him
fifty dollars per

175
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:19,085
It's worth twice as much
to hear him call me sir

176
00:13:19,187 --> 00:13:20,347
Hit it!
Sir!

177
00:13:20,454 --> 00:13:23,856
while I sit
in my cozy office

178
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,256
He's outside
working hard

179
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:30,819
Out in the hall
at my beck and call

180
00:13:30,932 --> 00:13:34,631
with a feather duster
standing on guard

181
00:13:38,341 --> 00:13:42,208
One, two, three, four.
Hep, two, three, four.

182
00:13:42,312 --> 00:13:44,576
'Tention!

183
00:13:45,882 --> 00:13:47,782
At ease.

184
00:13:47,885 --> 00:13:49,784
Squad right!

185
00:13:49,886 --> 00:13:52,821
Forward... march!

186
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,160
Halt.

187
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,294
Attack!

188
00:14:06,404 --> 00:14:11,365
I've got the guy
who used to be my captain

189
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,741
working for me

190
00:14:14,847 --> 00:14:17,975
He made me stay
in the kitchen all day

191
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:21,248
Now he's doing
my K.P.

192
00:14:21,388 --> 00:14:23,253
And by and by

193
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:28,818
I'm gonna have him wrapped
in work up to his brow

194
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:33,422
when he comes into the
office I must get on my feet

195
00:14:33,535 --> 00:14:37,301
'Tention!
Make a retreat

196
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:40,239
who was it said
revenge is sweet

197
00:14:40,341 --> 00:14:43,903
I've got my captain
working for me now

198
00:14:44,012 --> 00:14:48,416
I've got my captain working
for me Captain working for me

199
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:51,782
Captain working
for me now

200
00:14:56,293 --> 00:15:00,731
I've always said you have a great
future. If you'd just let me-

201
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:05,334
Anybody hurt?

202
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:08,667
I like hearing you sing. I
like hearing you say that.

203
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,241
we've seen what passes for
the floor show. Let's go, Mary.

204
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:16,042
You can't make chumps out of my flapjacks.
I wouldn't do that at your house!

205
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:19,208
Johnny, you and I are dear
friends. will you go away?

206
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:22,345
Jed! I thought we were having such fun.

207
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:26,221
we'll letJed have his way. we'll
all go to the party. I accept.

208
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,259
what party?
At the woodside Inn.

209
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,420
Mr. Dillingham is looking
at his singers. Oh?

210
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:33,032
I could ask you to come, but
I know you can't get away.

211
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,760
I have a place like this so I
can get away. You joining us?

212
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:37,962
Naturally.
Strike up the band!

213
00:15:38,072 --> 00:15:40,200
would you mind turning
off the gas? Right-o!

214
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:42,208
Thank you.

215
00:15:55,024 --> 00:15:59,357
He's not so good in a crowd
but when you get him alone

216
00:15:59,462 --> 00:16:01,896
You'd be surprised

217
00:16:01,998 --> 00:16:06,663
He isn't much at a dance
but when he's taking you home

218
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:09,398
You'd be surprised

219
00:16:09,506 --> 00:16:13,568
He doesn't look
like much of a lover

220
00:16:13,678 --> 00:16:17,808
But don't judge a book
by its cover

221
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:20,680
He's got
the face of an angel

222
00:16:20,785 --> 00:16:24,380
But there's a devil
in his eye

223
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:28,221
He's such a delicate thing but
when he starts in to squeeze

224
00:16:28,327 --> 00:16:31,888
Uh-mmm
You'd be surprised

225
00:16:31,998 --> 00:16:36,697
He doesn't look very strong
but when you sit on his knees

226
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:40,067
You'd be surprised

227
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:43,803
At a party
or at a ball

228
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,142
I've got to admit
he's nothing at all

229
00:16:47,248 --> 00:16:50,046
But in a morris chair

230
00:16:50,151 --> 00:16:54,282
You"d be surprised

231
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:00,259
wonderful party.
Yes...

232
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:03,991
if there weren't
quite so many people.

233
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,332
- Oh,Jed?
- Yes, Mr. Dillingham.

234
00:17:08,471 --> 00:17:10,962
Couple of things I want
to talk to you about.

235
00:17:14,844 --> 00:17:18,212
First, what'll you
have to drink?

236
00:17:18,315 --> 00:17:22,149
Oh,just
a small arsenic.

237
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,752
You dance very well,
Johnny.

238
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,421
You've heard of Maurice, the
international dancing star? Yes.

239
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,555
Sold him his first pair of pumps. No!

240
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:36,567
Yes!

241
00:17:38,437 --> 00:17:42,533
Nita, I happen to be
in show business myself.

242
00:17:42,675 --> 00:17:44,576
( Man ) Waiter.! Yes, sir.

243
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:48,778
He looked
a little familiar.

244
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:51,715
A little familiar
I don't mind.

245
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:07,465
These high-class places!

246
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:10,163
Don't you think we're gettin' off
our course? we'd better head back.

247
00:18:10,272 --> 00:18:12,206
why?
why?

248
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:15,743
I had a reason, but
it slipped my mind.

249
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:24,377
what do you think we'll find
in here? Us, you suppose?

250
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:27,082
Let's go in and see. All right.

251
00:18:28,391 --> 00:18:31,725
Very private in here,
hmm? Isn't it nice?

252
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:33,729
Do you thinkJed's
gonna like this?

253
00:18:33,831 --> 00:18:37,096
How could he? He isn't
here? I noticed that.

254
00:18:37,202 --> 00:18:40,296
Fellas can get punched in
the nose for things like this.

255
00:18:40,405 --> 00:18:43,772
I don't believe you're
worried. Oh, these dancers...

256
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,776
they're quick on
their feet, shifty.

257
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:48,346
He might cut me to pieces
before I could tag you.

258
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,610
How long you going to keep
this thing going? what thing?

259
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,549
This burn on Jed. That's
what I'm here for, isn't it?

260
00:18:54,654 --> 00:18:56,349
Oh, no!
No?

261
00:18:56,456 --> 00:19:00,119
No!
I like you,Johnny.

262
00:19:00,227 --> 00:19:04,027
well, that's
a strange coincidence.

263
00:19:04,131 --> 00:19:07,067
I like you, too,
Mary.

264
00:19:07,168 --> 00:19:10,137
( Clears Throat )

265
00:19:10,238 --> 00:19:15,073
when I first saw you, it was like
meeting someone from home. Yeah?

266
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:18,634
This is only my second year
away from Duluth...

267
00:19:18,747 --> 00:19:23,309
and the people I've met here, around
the theater mostly, seem irresponsible...

268
00:19:23,452 --> 00:19:26,388
and not like you.
Irresponsible, huh?

269
00:19:26,488 --> 00:19:30,084
You know, you remind me
a lot of George. George?

270
00:19:30,193 --> 00:19:33,526
My brother-in-law:
his charm, sincerity...

271
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,623
and the word Dad
always uses... stability.

272
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:38,634
Stability, huh?

273
00:19:38,736 --> 00:19:40,327
Hmph.

274
00:19:40,438 --> 00:19:42,906
You know what I like about George? what?

275
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:46,135
His sister-in-law. I'm sorry
she's going on the road.

276
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:52,448
Johnny, I'll miss your place,
the Flapjack.

277
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:54,746
I'll miss it too.
You?

278
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:57,321
Yeah, I sold it today.
I have other plans.

279
00:19:57,422 --> 00:19:59,618
A bigger place? A smaller
place, more intimate.

280
00:19:59,726 --> 00:20:01,627
Gonna call it the
Hole In The wall.

281
00:20:01,728 --> 00:20:05,664
won't a smaller place make less
money? If I'm on my toes, it will.

282
00:20:05,765 --> 00:20:07,699
I don't understand.

283
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,601
Did you ever have a good, new
hat that you grew tired of?

284
00:20:11,705 --> 00:20:14,732
Of course, but aren't
nightclubs more expensive?

285
00:20:14,842 --> 00:20:16,810
More fun too.

286
00:20:16,912 --> 00:20:20,904
I guess Jed wasn't joking about
your betting on that horse.

287
00:20:21,016 --> 00:20:24,747
No, I don't think Dad would
say you have stability. No.

288
00:20:24,853 --> 00:20:26,754
I still like
the way you sing.

289
00:20:26,888 --> 00:20:28,789
I still like to
hear you say it.

290
00:20:28,891 --> 00:20:32,793
But I think you sing the
wrong kind of songs. You do?

291
00:20:32,894 --> 00:20:36,296
Not that comic songs aren't all right,
but take the one they're playing now.

292
00:20:36,432 --> 00:20:38,333
Do you know it?

293
00:20:38,434 --> 00:20:41,232
( Romantic )

294
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:45,866
( Humming )

295
00:20:45,976 --> 00:20:49,537
No, the words... sing it. All right.

296
00:20:49,647 --> 00:20:51,512
So it won't be a total loss,
let's dance.

297
00:20:56,455 --> 00:21:01,324
All by myself

298
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:06,627
In the morning

299
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:11,397
All by myself

300
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:14,632
In the night

301
00:21:16,977 --> 00:21:21,812
I sit alone

302
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:27,718
In a cozy
morris chair

303
00:21:27,823 --> 00:21:32,658
So unhappy there

304
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,892
Playing solitaire

305
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:42,334
All by myself

306
00:21:42,438 --> 00:21:46,340
I get lonely

307
00:21:48,379 --> 00:21:56,048
watching the clock

Oh, hello. why,Jed, how are you?

315
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:37,256
Mary, may I remind you that
since the beginning of time,

316
00:22:37,365 --> 00:22:41,063
women have been attracted to shiftless,
unreliable, no-good vagabonds.

The wise woman runs from this
sort as she would from the plague.

00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:48,301
Nothing personal, dear fellow.
Of course not, dear friend.

319
00:22:48,444 --> 00:22:51,345
what he told you
is very true.

320
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:55,384
I've changed my mind, if you still
want me in the Dillingham show.

That's great!

00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:14,688
He did? Yeah! Throw him out.

463
00:36:14,795 --> 00:36:17,491
That might not be necessary,
if you behave yourself.

464
00:36:17,598 --> 00:36:20,294
If he behaves himself! And If I don't?

465
00:36:20,401 --> 00:36:23,633
He'll break every bone in
your body. You're so right.

466
00:36:23,738 --> 00:36:27,004
Maybe you don't know it, but I
happen to be the bouncer here.

467
00:36:27,108 --> 00:36:30,510
Okay, start bouncing.

468
00:36:30,612 --> 00:36:33,707
Nita, I'd rather you
didn't watch this.

469
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,842
Messy, you know.
Please.

470
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:40,514
we'd better step outside.
A pleasure! Come on!

471
00:36:47,698 --> 00:36:50,189
Oh!

472
00:36:51,802 --> 00:36:53,702
Coward!

473
00:37:02,447 --> 00:37:04,348
You wanna buy
a nightclub?

474
00:37:07,086 --> 00:37:10,647
How 'bout
some champagne?

475
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,054
No champagne?

476
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:15,856
Tsk! It's
absolutely incredible.

477
00:37:15,963 --> 00:37:18,830
No one gal
could be that pretty.

478
00:37:20,434 --> 00:37:22,494
How's Jed?

479
00:37:22,603 --> 00:37:25,334
Fine.

480
00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:30,139
You know, I really intended
to go to that opening.

481
00:37:30,246 --> 00:37:33,646
This the next place? No, that's
a little spot I had in Cleveland.

482
00:37:33,748 --> 00:37:37,548
The next place is gonna be something!
I'm gonna call it the Song Book.

483
00:37:37,652 --> 00:37:40,554
And when do you sell the Song
Book? Not selling, keeping.

484
00:37:40,656 --> 00:37:43,717
That's the place I've always dreamed
about, but never could quite figure it out.

485
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:47,956
Near the park, outdoors with fresh
air and music, lights and scenery!

486
00:37:48,097 --> 00:37:51,761
No drunks.

487
00:37:51,868 --> 00:37:54,838
C'mon, this has been a big
evening for you and me, hasn't it?

488
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,736
I sell the place and you
walk off with a big hit.

489
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:01,107
It didn't mean a lot to me,Johnny. No?

490
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,203
Other things mean
ever so much more.

491
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:05,545
Like what?

492
00:38:05,651 --> 00:38:09,178
want me to answer that?
Yes, if you'd like.

493
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:12,519
You're more important
to me,Johnny.

494
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,956
See here, lady.
You're a Broadway star.

495
00:38:15,094 --> 00:38:17,586
You better keep
your sense of values.

496
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:21,393
I'm in love with you,
Johnny.

497
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:24,595
You in love with me? Yeah.

498
00:38:24,704 --> 00:38:27,195
I guess I am...
plenty.

499
00:38:27,308 --> 00:38:31,711
well, haven't I done more than my
share? Do I have to propose too?

500
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:33,780
Oh, Mary!

501
00:38:33,881 --> 00:38:38,147
Oh,Johnny! I'd have
died if you'd said no.

502
00:38:41,223 --> 00:38:44,715
Mary, this is a very
difficult thing to say.

503
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:47,387
There's a lot of fellas
cut out to be husbands,

504
00:38:47,496 --> 00:38:50,295
but I'm just not
one of them.

505
00:38:50,432 --> 00:38:55,337
You like stability, and stability
and I just don't get along.

506
00:38:55,471 --> 00:38:58,908
I might marry you and I'd be
hurting you. That would hurt me too.

507
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:03,036
I guess I'm just selfish.
That's the way I am though.

508
00:39:03,147 --> 00:39:05,547
I didn't want this
to happen, Mary.

509
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:34,179
I just happened to be
in the neighborhood.

510
00:39:37,184 --> 00:39:40,244
Something up?
Something's over.

511
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,977
I guess a girl should know
better than to propose.

512
00:40:08,452 --> 00:40:11,216
Mary, you know,

513
00:40:11,322 --> 00:40:14,450
sometimes a place horse
pays more than the winner.

514
00:40:14,558 --> 00:40:19,052
Now, if you'd like to try
that proposal a second time-

515
00:40:24,035 --> 00:40:26,834
"During the months that followed
Mary tried to forgetJohnny.

516
00:40:26,938 --> 00:40:30,670
"And Jed was usually there
to make forgetting easier.

517
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:34,371
"They danced together, dined together
and went to the movies together.

518
00:40:34,514 --> 00:40:37,881
"Those were the days when the nation
was keeping cool with Coolidge...

519
00:40:41,888 --> 00:40:45,984
"and discovering fabulous gold
in Wall Street"s ticker tape.

520
00:40:46,093 --> 00:40:49,689
"The younger people were keeping a little
less cool with the screen"s great love legend,

521
00:40:49,796 --> 00:40:52,823
"Rudolph Valentino.

522
00:40:59,108 --> 00:41:02,544
"Another year brought another
Broadway show forJed and Mary.

523
00:41:02,678 --> 00:41:06,205
The day after the opening,
as the company was rehearsing-"

524
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:09,215
Keep it up, girls.

525
00:41:09,318 --> 00:41:12,584
Oh, no! The right foot, not the left.

526
00:41:12,688 --> 00:41:15,282
How are you?
Oh, hello.

527
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:17,622
I'd like to see
Mary O'Dare, please.

528
00:41:17,727 --> 00:41:21,458
Angie, show her which
is her right foot, please.

529
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:23,499
well, look who's here!

530
00:41:23,601 --> 00:41:27,662
lohnny,
come on in.!

531
00:41:27,773 --> 00:41:30,264
Twinkle-toes, how are
you? Sure glad to see you.

532
00:41:30,374 --> 00:41:32,275
Tony. How are you, Jed?

533
00:41:32,377 --> 00:41:34,402
Been almost a year, hasn't
it? A wonderful year.

534
00:41:34,546 --> 00:41:38,710
Angie, give them all ten
minutes. Okay, kids, take ten.

535
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,311
See you later.

536
00:41:43,456 --> 00:41:45,549
I caught your opening
last night. Good opening.

537
00:41:45,658 --> 00:41:48,822
I thought you were on a little
bit too long. Thanks very much.

538
00:41:48,928 --> 00:41:50,863
You haven't changed.
Not a bit.

539
00:41:50,964 --> 00:41:54,661
There must be an audience for your kind
of dancing, but I never could go for it.

540
00:41:54,768 --> 00:41:57,134
You needn't apologize
for your lack of taste.

541
00:41:57,237 --> 00:41:59,069
Anybody can have
a blind spot.

542
00:41:59,173 --> 00:42:01,266
There was a girl in
the show. She was grand.

543
00:42:01,376 --> 00:42:02,809
Mary?
Yes.

544
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:06,312
Isn't that funny. we were
talking about you just a year ago,

545
00:42:06,414 --> 00:42:08,314
you and your quaint
little nightclubs.

546
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:11,385
Charming, but you won't
take offense? Not at all.

547
00:42:11,486 --> 00:42:13,716
I know the atmosphere
your customers like.

548
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:17,884
But would it be too daring if you
occasionally had the joint swept out?

549
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,554
You still have the heart
of a janitor. where is Mary?

550
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,824
Um, uh
- ( Man ) Say,Johnny.!

551
00:42:22,933 --> 00:42:25,993
Don't you remember?
Passaic, New Jersey?

552
00:42:26,103 --> 00:42:29,665
Cliff was at the piano when we
played the Bijou. Old Cliff, huh?

553
00:42:29,773 --> 00:42:32,504
How are you? You guys
had a sweet little act.

554
00:42:32,609 --> 00:42:34,908
I remember it very well.
That's more than he ever did.

555
00:42:35,313 --> 00:42:38,111
Is that so? Johnny,
do you remember this?

556
00:42:38,216 --> 00:42:39,844
( Piano )

557
00:42:39,951 --> 00:42:42,512
"Song and Dance Man. " "Song
and Dance Man. " That's right.

558
00:42:42,654 --> 00:42:45,556
He didn't remember it then,
how can he know it now? Get out!

559
00:42:45,657 --> 00:42:48,091
I bet I could do it now.
You wanna try it? what?

560
00:42:48,227 --> 00:42:50,127
Can you play it? Play it. Sure.

561
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,097
Go ahead.

562
00:42:56,669 --> 00:43:00,036
In us you see a couple
of song and dance men

563
00:43:00,141 --> 00:43:04,271
I'm the song
I'm the dance

564
00:43:04,378 --> 00:43:07,836
For laughter joy and
happiness we're advance men

565
00:43:07,948 --> 00:43:11,817
with a song
And a dance

566
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,686
I sing for my supper
I dance for my lunch

567
00:43:15,824 --> 00:43:19,760
I croon when
the landlord comes around

568
00:43:19,895 --> 00:43:23,457
For miles around the women
and children pass out cold

569
00:43:23,566 --> 00:43:27,263
when my voice hits the air
And my feet hit the ground

570
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:34,870
Last night Out in the moonlight

571
00:43:34,978 --> 00:43:39,141
I came to serenade
A very pretty maid

572
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:43,414
I sang her to sleep with
"Asleep In The Deep"

573
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,922
That always makes
them collapse

574
00:43:47,025 --> 00:43:50,984
I saw her eyes close
then she started to doze

575
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:54,621
But she arose
when I sounded taps

576
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:58,294
which goes to show what women
will do when we're around

577
00:43:58,405 --> 00:44:02,465
And my voice hits the air
And my feet hit the ground

578
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,888
Ladies and gentlemen, my partner
will now give you his impression...

579
00:45:19,993 --> 00:45:23,485
of a young man on the way to visit
his best girl on a Sunday afternoon.

580
00:45:23,598 --> 00:45:25,498
My partner.

581
00:45:35,244 --> 00:45:38,372
Ayoung lady crossing the street
on a rainy afternoon.

582
00:45:42,718 --> 00:45:44,710
Skip the gutter.!
whoo!

583
00:45:48,491 --> 00:45:50,958
Ayoung man on his way to the
saloon to get a scuttle of suds,

584
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:54,623
otherwise known as
"rushing the growler. "

585
00:46:00,104 --> 00:46:03,438
My, he's been in
that saloon a long time!

586
00:46:14,419 --> 00:46:18,254
A porter helping you rush
to catch the 5:15 train.

587
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:37,102
we will now do two lumberjacks
meeting on the street.

588
00:46:44,753 --> 00:46:45,982
Hiya!

589
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:52,418
Timber!

590
00:46:52,528 --> 00:46:57,592
Our next impression will be two local
politicians meeting on the street.

591
00:47:01,738 --> 00:47:04,764
My friend!
Hello!

592
00:47:04,876 --> 00:47:08,675
Here, here, here!
I've been layin' off, friend.

593
00:47:08,813 --> 00:47:13,614
Our next impression will be two farmers,
Hy and Sy, meeting on the street.

594
00:47:17,723 --> 00:47:19,622
Hi, Sy!
Morning, Hy!

595
00:47:19,724 --> 00:47:22,216
well, what're we waiting
fer? Let's get at it.

596
00:47:25,598 --> 00:47:27,622
How 'bout
a little cream?

597
00:47:33,573 --> 00:47:35,474
Hey!

598
00:47:46,954 --> 00:47:49,787
whoo!

599
00:47:49,891 --> 00:47:51,824
Johnny, you sure
surprise me.

600
00:47:51,927 --> 00:47:54,794
with a couple more
rehearsals, I can use you. Oh!

601
00:47:54,896 --> 00:47:58,388
All right, girls, places. Say,Jed,
I didn't come here to reminisce.

602
00:47:59,569 --> 00:48:02,629
where's Mary?
Mary?

603
00:48:02,739 --> 00:48:04,673
Oh, I'm glad
you mentioned her.

604
00:48:04,774 --> 00:48:07,903
Got something
to show you.

605
00:48:09,145 --> 00:48:11,137
Is it for Mary?

606
00:48:11,247 --> 00:48:14,012
Yeah.

607
00:48:17,721 --> 00:48:19,622
You're a lucky guy.

608
00:48:21,792 --> 00:48:23,693
Hello,Johnny.

609
00:48:23,795 --> 00:48:26,355
Hello, Mary.

610
00:48:26,464 --> 00:48:29,992
Congratulations. Thank
you. Saw the show?

611
00:48:30,101 --> 00:48:32,400
Oh, yeah the show!
Yeah.

612
00:48:32,505 --> 00:48:34,405
You were great.

613
00:48:34,507 --> 00:48:39,411
I, uh, sort of thought you
might drop over to my place,

614
00:48:39,513 --> 00:48:41,709
the two of you.

615
00:48:41,815 --> 00:48:45,182
we might do that sometime.
what place you got now?

616
00:48:45,285 --> 00:48:47,049
Still the Song Book.

617
00:48:47,154 --> 00:48:50,420
I'm keeping that.

618
00:48:50,558 --> 00:48:54,016
well, I just wanted you to know
how much I liked you in the show.

619
00:48:54,162 --> 00:48:56,357
That's very nice
of you,Johnny.

620
00:48:56,465 --> 00:48:59,161
You, too,Jed.
Thanks,Johnny.

621
00:48:59,267 --> 00:49:01,793
So long.

622
00:49:06,742 --> 00:49:09,268
Still over it?

623
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:12,007
Completely.

624
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,752
Call me at the bank,
uh, Federal Reserve,

625
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:18,754
anytime between
10:00 and 3:00.

626
00:49:18,856 --> 00:49:22,451
I've always wanted to go
out with a banker. How sweet.

627
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:26,654
Tony. Don't forget,just
ask for the vice president.

628
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:30,199
Good day.

629
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,917
Good thing he showed up. why?

630
00:49:46,018 --> 00:49:49,113
I kind of had a feeling
he was still on your mind,

631
00:49:49,222 --> 00:49:52,886
without realizing it, I mean. Oh,Jed!

632
00:49:58,398 --> 00:50:00,491
I've got something
to show you.

633
00:50:00,634 --> 00:50:02,626
I've seen it.
It's beautiful.

634
00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:06,502
I thought maybe the second look
- It's the fifth look,Jed.

635
00:50:06,608 --> 00:50:09,806
That's even better.
You know what you're getting.

636
00:50:12,281 --> 00:50:15,683
No more nonsense. we're driving
toJersey to get married right now.

637
00:50:15,784 --> 00:50:20,950
Darling, you're sweet
and considerate.

638
00:50:21,056 --> 00:50:25,221
I'm sure there's no other man
in the world quite like you.

639
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:27,923
But-
But!

640
00:50:28,031 --> 00:50:30,022
what an
unpleasant word!

641
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:33,967
Please let me think about it
a little longer.

642
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:36,437
Pretty sure
it isn'tJohnny?

643
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:39,476
Quite sure.
Certain?

644
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:42,137
why do you keep saying
it's Johnny? It isn'tJohnny.

645
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:47,208
That's over.
I told you that.

646
00:50:47,319 --> 00:50:50,187
Mary, one way
or another,

647
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:52,884
you're getting
engaged tonight.

648
00:51:11,146 --> 00:51:13,205
That's Johnny's place.

649
00:51:13,315 --> 00:51:16,251
Let's not go in.
I don't want to see him.

650
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:19,047
But I want you to, Mary.
Go and talk to him.

651
00:51:19,154 --> 00:51:24,023
Get things straightened
out in your mind. No,Jed.

652
00:51:24,126 --> 00:51:27,960
I made that mistake
once before.

653
00:51:28,064 --> 00:51:32,968
Darling, I don"t think lohnny will
ever care very deeply for anybody.

654
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:36,529
I am a little worried
about your feeling for him.

655
00:51:36,673 --> 00:51:39,370
Anyway, it's time
we found out.

656
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:40,441
Come on.

657
00:51:45,917 --> 00:51:51,787
(Johnny ) You keep coming
back I'll wait here.

658
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:55,347
Like a song

659
00:51:56,862 --> 00:52:02,562
A song
that keeps saying

660
00:52:02,669 --> 00:52:05,365
Remember

661
00:52:07,273 --> 00:52:12,678
The sweet
used-to-be

662
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:18,082
That was once
you and me

663
00:52:19,653 --> 00:52:23,681
Keeps coming back

664
00:52:23,791 --> 00:52:28,253
Like an old melody

665
00:52:29,732 --> 00:52:37,639
The perfume of roses
in May

666
00:52:39,342 --> 00:52:49,446
Returns to my room
in December

667
00:52:50,988 --> 00:52:54,686
From out of the past

668
00:52:54,793 --> 00:53:01,859
where forgotten things
belong

669
00:53:02,802 --> 00:53:09,708
You keep coming back

670
00:53:09,809 --> 00:53:14,213
Like a song

671
00:53:18,051 --> 00:53:21,021
From out of the past

672
00:53:21,154 --> 00:53:27,526
( Chorus ) Where forgotten things belong

673
00:53:27,628 --> 00:53:32,293
You keep coming back

674
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:41,106
Like a song

675
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:49,917
I"ll be loving you
always

676
00:53:50,053 --> 00:53:56,584
With a love that"s true
always

677
00:53:56,727 --> 00:54:01,289
When the things we planned
need a helping hand

678
00:54:01,398 --> 00:54:03,390
Hey, buddy?

679
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:08,639
wanna buy
a hot ring?

680
00:54:10,443 --> 00:54:14,742
Days may not be fair
always

681
00:54:36,437 --> 00:54:39,600
That's lovely. Let's
stop here. whoa. Giddap.

682
00:54:39,707 --> 00:54:42,938
AttendeZ.!
Oh, a French horse.

683
00:54:43,044 --> 00:54:45,512
No, he's French Canadian,
I think.

684
00:54:52,855 --> 00:54:55,848
Lunch. Yeah. Packin' the kitchen.

685
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:58,825
The master
is famished.

686
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,697
Happy,Johnny?
Mm-hmm.

687
00:55:07,338 --> 00:55:10,774
There was something I wanted
to tell you. About lunch?

688
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:13,070
No, about me.
what was it?

689
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:18,081
Oh! It was about me being in
love with my wife. You better be.

690
00:55:18,183 --> 00:55:21,642
That's quite a face you
have. I'm glad you think so.

691
00:55:21,753 --> 00:55:24,552
I think
I'll keep it.

692
00:55:24,657 --> 00:55:27,421
Oh,Johnny!

693
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:30,587
Three weeks is such
a short honeymoon.

694
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:33,255
I was countin' on
about 60 years.

695
00:55:33,399 --> 00:55:36,266
That's all right
with me.

696
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:39,100
Johnny,
when we get back,

697
00:55:39,207 --> 00:55:42,768
would you mind if I helped out at
the Song Book? I want to be with you.

698
00:55:42,876 --> 00:55:46,472
Sure. You're always with
me. It'll be such fun.

699
00:55:46,581 --> 00:55:50,574
If anyone comes in, I'll say, "See
that fascinating fellow over there?

700
00:55:50,684 --> 00:55:54,485
That's my husband.
He owns the Song Book. "

701
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:58,025
That might not be entirely
accurate, honey. Hmm?

702
00:55:58,127 --> 00:56:02,325
That fascinating fellow's not
your husband. It's Mr. Rakopolis.

703
00:56:02,466 --> 00:56:05,798
Rakopolis? Amazing little
guy. Loves to buy nightclubs.

704
00:56:05,902 --> 00:56:08,837
You sold him the Song
Book? A very small loss!

705
00:56:08,939 --> 00:56:13,001
It was doing so well. wait'll you
see the new place I have in mind.

706
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:18,139
Johnny, didn't you say we
were partners? I was wrong.

707
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:21,308
You are the boss!

708
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:26,049
No. Junior partner, that's me.
Uh-uh. That position's filled.

709
00:56:26,158 --> 00:56:29,058
Honey, from now on
I'm gonna be Mr. Stability.

710
00:56:29,161 --> 00:56:32,494
I don't make a move
without checking with the boss.

711
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:36,091
Okay?
Okay.

712
00:56:36,236 --> 00:56:42,038
( whistling "Blue Skies" )

713
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:51,307
You like kids, don't you?
Sure... even better than horses.

714
00:56:51,419 --> 00:56:53,546
I think we oughta have
about five kids.

715
00:56:53,655 --> 00:56:58,354
First four oughta be girls, and the
rest can be anything else you want.

716
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:02,191
( Humming )

717
00:57:02,297 --> 00:57:05,529
we're gonna think about the
future, aren't we? Right.

718
00:57:05,634 --> 00:57:08,763
Right.

719
00:57:08,871 --> 00:57:12,102
Johnny, look at that sky!
It's gonna storm.

720
00:57:12,241 --> 00:57:12,605
No, not for us, honey.

721
00:57:15,878 --> 00:57:21,112
Never saw the sun
shinin' so bright

722
00:57:21,217 --> 00:57:26,555
Never saw things
goin' so right

723
00:57:26,657 --> 00:57:31,595
Noticing the days
hurrying by

724
00:57:31,696 --> 00:57:35,598
when you're in love

725
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:39,762
My, how they fly

726
00:57:39,872 --> 00:57:43,774
( Thundering )

727
00:58:00,495 --> 00:58:04,795
Blue skies

728
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:07,663
Smilin' at me

729
00:58:09,504 --> 00:58:14,739
Nothin' but blue skies

730
00:58:14,843 --> 00:58:17,812
Do I see

731
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:24,814
Blue birds

732
00:58:24,921 --> 00:58:29,221
Singin' a song

733
00:58:29,326 --> 00:58:34,525
Nothin' but blue birds

734
00:58:34,633 --> 00:58:37,430
All day long

735
00:58:40,138 --> 00:58:45,303
Never saw the sun
shinin' so bright

736
00:58:45,411 --> 00:58:50,541
Never saw things
goin' so right

737
00:58:50,683 --> 00:58:55,620
Noticing the days
hurrying by

when you're in love

739
00:58:58,425 --> 00:59:00,620
My, how they fly

740
00:59:00,727 --> 00:59:05,528
Blue days

741
00:59:05,632 --> 00:59:10,626
All of them gone

742
00:59:10,738 --> 00:59:16,735
Nothing but blue skies

743
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:22,182
From now on

744
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:30,983
Nothing but blue skies

745
00:59:45,743 --> 00:59:50,112
"And for quite a while the skies
remained blue forJohnny and Mary.

"He opened another nightclub,
this time in Cleveland,

747
00:59:52,885 --> 00:59:55,319
a charming spot which
he said he'd never sell. "

748
00:59:55,419 --> 00:59:59,322
(Johnny ) Just a little room or two

749

Can more than do

750

A little man
and wife

That"s if they"re contented ( Coughing )

With the little things

butJohnny had a better idea.

That meant moving
to St. Louis. "

755
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:23,540
(Johnny ) Not for all the rice in China

756
01:00:23,652 --> 01:00:27,713
Not for all the knobs
on doors

757
01:00:27,822 --> 01:00:32,191
Would I agree to part with all
thejoy you fill my heart with

758

When you said
I"m yours

Every night

You"ll hear her croon

Her Russian lullaby

Rock-a-bye my baby

01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:37,924
Oh, Tony, look!

772
01:01:39,935 --> 01:01:42,961
Doesn't that make you sort
of yearn for something?

773
01:01:43,105 --> 01:01:46,507
Yeah. Dinner.
I'm starving.

774
01:01:46,609 --> 01:01:50,511
will you stop that pacing?
You're making me nervous.

775
01:01:50,613 --> 01:01:53,515
Sit down.

776
01:01:53,617 --> 01:01:56,450
I'll take over.

777
01:02:03,794 --> 01:02:06,321
Is Mary all right? Yes, she's fine.

778
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:09,559
Not too close.

779
01:02:13,639 --> 01:02:15,401
Tiny, isn"t he?

780
01:02:15,508 --> 01:02:17,305
She!
Yes, she.

781
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:20,140
The little lady weighs six
pounds, three ounces. Is that good?

782
01:02:20,246 --> 01:02:23,340
Perfect. Not too close!
what's the matter with you?

783
01:02:25,285 --> 01:02:27,684
well, they always look
like that. when my cousin-

784
01:02:27,788 --> 01:02:30,484
She's beautiful!
You think so?

785
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:34,321
Yes. Doctor, can I go
in and see Mary now?

786
01:02:34,429 --> 01:02:38,160
She's still half asleep, but
you may see her. Thank you.

787
01:02:38,266 --> 01:02:40,131
I'm sorry.
Only the father.

788
01:02:49,545 --> 01:02:52,309
Hello, paleface.

789
01:02:52,414 --> 01:02:55,680
Johnny, where were you?
I needed you.

790
01:02:55,785 --> 01:02:58,482
Believe me, I was so nervous
I needed you too.

791
01:02:58,588 --> 01:03:01,455
Oh, you should've told me.

792
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:08,792
See her? Yeah, she's beautiful.

793
01:03:08,899 --> 01:03:11,390
Like me?
Like you.

794
01:03:13,438 --> 01:03:16,805
My child.
what else would you expect?

795
01:03:16,942 --> 01:03:19,433
You're pretty pleased with
yourself today, aren't you?

796
01:03:19,578 --> 01:03:23,606
Mm-hmm. You pleased with me?

797
01:03:25,118 --> 01:03:27,746
Mm-hmm.

01:03:27,854 --> 01:03:31,051
Pleased with
the baby too.

799
01:03:31,157 --> 01:03:35,185
She's lucky, isn't she,Johnny,
being our child?

800
01:03:35,294 --> 01:03:38,458
we're lucky too,
honey.

801
01:03:41,135 --> 01:03:44,902
She's going to college,
isn't she? Not right away.

802
01:03:45,006 --> 01:03:48,407
She'll have all the things
we didn't have. You betcha.

803
01:03:52,414 --> 01:03:54,575
You feeling all right?

804
01:03:57,486 --> 01:04:01,115
I had a baby today,
a beautiful baby girl.

805
01:04:01,223 --> 01:04:03,623
I know.
I had one too.

806
01:04:03,727 --> 01:04:06,924
Oh, don't be silly. Men don't
have babies. You wanna bet?

807
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:09,965
Name one.
Me!

808
01:04:10,066 --> 01:04:13,331
That's right.

809
01:04:15,272 --> 01:04:17,468
Honey, I wanna
tell you something.

810
01:04:17,574 --> 01:04:20,875
From now on my feet are
gonna be on the ground, solid.

811
01:04:20,978 --> 01:04:23,674
No more shifting around
from place to place,

812
01:04:23,816 --> 01:04:27,582
traveling around.
Thank you,Johnny.

813
01:04:27,686 --> 01:04:29,586
I got something
I wanna show you.

814
01:04:29,688 --> 01:04:31,622
Don't go away.

815
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:36,685
I made arrangements
at the bank.

816
01:04:38,731 --> 01:04:42,690

elaborate and best nightclub in all New York.

diapers trimmed in platina.

818
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:49,771
There it is, honey,
our gold mine.

819
01:04:50,978 --> 01:04:54,277
Bonsoir.!

Mesdames, Monsieur,

821
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,882
Are we too late
for the show?

822
01:05:00,989 --> 01:05:03,686
No, it will start
in about 15 minutes.

823
01:05:03,792 --> 01:05:05,783
I'm so glad.
I know you'll enjoy it.

824

Danke schoen.

828
01:05:31,389 --> 01:05:33,483
Auf Wiedersehen.

829
01:05:37,595 --> 01:05:40,997
Ah, the reservations!

830
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:43,762
we have enough to fill
this place for a month!

831
01:05:43,869 --> 01:05:44,393
Hear that,Jed?

832
01:05:58,486 --> 01:06:02,183
( Orchestra )

833
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:51,967
Everybody, step
to the syncopated rhythm

834
01:06:52,078 --> 01:06:56,105
Let's be goin' with 'em
when they begin

835
01:06:56,216 --> 01:06:59,379
You'll be sayin'
Yes sir, the band is grand

836
01:06:59,486 --> 01:07:03,013
He's the best professor
in all the land

837
01:07:03,123 --> 01:07:06,024
Listen to the pep
that emerges from the middle

838
01:07:06,127 --> 01:07:10,427
Of the jazzy fiddle
under his chin

839
01:07:10,565 --> 01:07:13,966
Oh, what music

840
01:07:14,068 --> 01:07:17,232
The clarineter
could not be better

841
01:07:17,338 --> 01:07:19,272
Hear that strain

842
01:07:19,408 --> 01:07:21,808
I don't know
just what it is

843
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:24,572
But it's great

844
01:07:24,681 --> 01:07:28,138
They simply ruin it
Look at 'em doin' it

845
01:07:28,251 --> 01:07:31,345
Come, come
don't hesitate

846
01:07:31,454 --> 01:07:34,582
Everybody, step in
if you wanna see a glutton

847
01:07:34,691 --> 01:07:38,388
when it comes to struttin'
over the crowd

848
01:07:38,496 --> 01:07:41,431
wait 'til you see
my little sweetie and me

849
01:07:41,532 --> 01:07:45,230
Step, step, step
stepping around

850
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:57,305
[ Skipped item nr. 850 ]

851
01:08:35,891 --> 01:08:37,791
The Top Hat
was a great success.

852
01:08:37,894 --> 01:08:39,885
It meant security,
roots in the ground.

853
01:08:39,995 --> 01:08:44,195
The things Mary wanted, but
not whatJohnny wanted. So...

854
01:08:44,301 --> 01:08:50,001
( Phone Ringing )

855
01:08:52,343 --> 01:08:54,436
Yes?

856
01:08:54,579 --> 01:08:56,604
No, but he is
back in town.

857
01:08:56,747 --> 01:08:58,772
He just phoned
from the station.

858
01:08:58,916 --> 01:09:01,477
Mr. Cuyler?

859
01:09:03,122 --> 01:09:06,455
Did he say
he wanted to sell?

860
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,550
Oh.

861
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:10,594
Could you call
in about 15 minutes?

862
01:09:10,697 --> 01:09:12,722
(Johnny ) I"ll be loving you always

863
01:09:12,832 --> 01:09:16,495
Mr. Cuyler?
Mary?

864
01:09:16,603 --> 01:09:19,163
The fisherman's home.

865
01:09:19,273 --> 01:09:21,570
How are you, lohnny? I'm a little tired.

866
01:09:21,675 --> 01:09:24,075
working all day
over a hot brook.

867
01:09:24,211 --> 01:09:26,145
It's good
to be back.

868
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:30,216
They were really bitin' up there this
year, Mary. Everybody caught their limit.

869
01:09:30,352 --> 01:09:32,411
Tony caught cold.

870
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,785
Baby awake?
No.

871
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:38,657
She's all right, isn't she? Fine.

872
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,820
Johnny, a
Mr. Cuyler phoned.

873
01:09:40,929 --> 01:09:43,694
Oh, Cuyler, hmm?

874
01:09:43,799 --> 01:09:46,666
That's a little business matter. I'm
gonna see him in the morning about it.

875
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:49,170
He said he was
going to buy the Top Hat.

876
01:09:49,273 --> 01:09:51,969
Did he say that?

877
01:09:52,075 --> 01:09:54,407
You're not going to sell,
are you,Johnny?

878
01:09:54,511 --> 01:09:58,607
well, I was kinda...
thinking about it.

879
01:09:58,749 --> 01:10:03,346
Sure you haven't made up your
mind? Yeah, I guess I have.

880
01:10:03,488 --> 01:10:05,421
without
consulting me?

881
01:10:05,523 --> 01:10:08,151
I didn't consult you
because I knew what you'd say.

882
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:12,491
In other words, you want my
opinion when it agrees with yours.

883
01:10:12,598 --> 01:10:15,157
Oh, Mary,
that's not being fair.

884
01:10:15,267 --> 01:10:17,258
wait'll you hear the
things I got planned.

885
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:19,929
A little nightclub in
Albuquerque? No, Louisville.

886
01:10:20,039 --> 01:10:23,237
You know how I feel about the
Top Hat, why I take these trips.

887
01:10:23,342 --> 01:10:25,504
The joint's too big.
There's no fun there.

888
01:10:25,612 --> 01:10:28,445
It's the most successful
place you've ever had,Johnny.

889
01:10:28,548 --> 01:10:31,676
And we have a child.
A wonderful child.

890
01:10:31,819 --> 01:10:34,379
I don't want you to
sell. I promised Cuyler.

891
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:37,980
You promised me too!

892
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:41,583
Johnny, in the three years we've been
married, I've done the things you wanted,

893
01:10:41,697 --> 01:10:44,426
whether it was go to St.
Louis, Cleveland or the movies.

894
01:10:44,533 --> 01:10:48,196
I've been selfish. Maybe...
without realizing it.

895
01:10:48,303 --> 01:10:50,204
But this time,
I want my way.

896
01:10:50,305 --> 01:10:53,969
I insist you don't sell. You
insist? That's a strong word.

897
01:10:54,077 --> 01:10:56,602
It's the way I feel. If our marriage
- Our marriage?

898
01:10:56,713 --> 01:10:59,238
You mean this can make a
difference? Yes, it can.

899
01:10:59,349 --> 01:11:01,978
well, it can't be much of
a marriage. well, is it?

900
01:11:02,085 --> 01:11:05,078
what kind of a question is
that? I'm not blaming you.

901
01:11:05,222 --> 01:11:09,283
I haven't forgotten about not wanting
to be tied down. I'm not tied down.

902
01:11:09,426 --> 01:11:11,622
If you're not,
it isn't a marriage!

903
01:11:11,729 --> 01:11:16,063
I'm tied down and you've got to
decide whether you want to be.

904
01:11:16,167 --> 01:11:18,965
I don't get it. If I sell the
Top Hat, you and I are washed up?

905
01:11:20,873 --> 01:11:23,067
That's exactly
what I mean.

906
01:11:25,378 --> 01:11:28,837
I don't like threats,
Mary. ( Phone Ringing )

907

Probably Cuyler.
Probably.

01:11:34,821 --> 01:11:37,051
Hello.

909
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:39,352
Hiya, Cuyler.

910
01:11:39,493 --> 01:11:42,326
Mm-hmm.
Certainly.

911
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:45,160
Draw up the papers. I'll have
my lawyer see you in the morning.

912
01:11:45,266 --> 01:11:46,927
Right.

913
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:58,069
"That's the way
it happened.

914
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:02,378
"Johnny and Mary parted, each convinced
that the other was no longer in love.

915
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:07,218
"The separation was painful, but
being proud, neither would back down.

916
01:12:07,324 --> 01:12:11,021
"Ayear went by, then another.
Mary never heard from Johnny.

917
01:12:11,162 --> 01:12:13,960
"And when Johnny heard from her,
it was through her lawyer.

had been granted.

in another show... with Jed.

aimlessly opening and selling nightclubs,

had a new place in Chicago:
the Cracker Barrel. "

Now, ladies and gentlemen, I want
you to meet dear Mrs. Murgatroyd.

an occasion of some significance.

01:12:36,823 --> 01:12:41,227
She thought she'd like to see what the
inside of a cocktail lounge looks like.

925
01:12:41,328 --> 01:12:45,821
Dear Mrs. Murgatroyd.
She's a grand girl, grand girl!

926
01:13:01,316 --> 01:13:03,284
( Sighs )

927
01:13:03,385 --> 01:13:07,254
My feet are killing me!

928
01:13:12,061 --> 01:13:14,155
( Sighs )

929
01:13:19,703 --> 01:13:22,638
Young man?
Young man!

930
01:13:22,739 --> 01:13:27,301
would you mind just
watching this bag please?

931
01:13:27,412 --> 01:13:29,903
Thank you very much.

932
01:13:39,858 --> 01:13:44,387
Young man... that bag.
Hmph!

933
01:13:44,496 --> 01:13:48,524
Oh! Oh, well, waiter, I don't
know exactly what to order.

934
01:13:48,635 --> 01:13:52,264
I, uh...
I am not a drinking woman.

935
01:13:52,406 --> 01:13:56,398
I'm celebrating my wedding anniversary
and I thought that you might-

936
01:13:56,543 --> 01:14:00,310
Thank you. Eighteenth anniversary.
Thank you. You're very kind.

937
01:14:00,414 --> 01:14:02,849
I thought that you might have
some drink that is sort of...

938
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:06,113
oh, I don't know,
sort of anniversary-ish like.

939
01:14:06,221 --> 01:14:08,519
Hmm?
No, I've never had a-

940
01:14:08,623 --> 01:14:12,889
waiter, I've never had
a drink in my life!

941
01:14:12,995 --> 01:14:17,591
well, once in a while a little
slug of gin, just a very little bit.

942
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,895
Hmm? You would
suggest what?

943
01:14:20,002 --> 01:14:23,097
Oh, no, no.
Something very mild.

944
01:14:23,206 --> 01:14:27,735
Something like a, um...
like a zombie.

945
01:14:27,878 --> 01:14:29,846
why do you stare?

946
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:32,175
Oh, never mind.
Just bring me a scotch and soda.

947
01:14:32,283 --> 01:14:34,217
Thank you.

948
01:15:05,485 --> 01:15:09,650
Oh, waiter, no,just leave it. I'll mix it mysel
- waiter,just leave it, please.

949
01:15:09,758 --> 01:15:14,524
I'll mix it. I'd rather
mix it myself. Thank you.

950
01:15:24,806 --> 01:15:27,275
( Sighs )

951
01:15:28,278 --> 01:15:31,042
Lucy!
LucyJamison!

952
01:15:32,850 --> 01:15:38,618
Imagine finding you in here!
The president of our lodge.

953
01:15:38,722 --> 01:15:40,622
Oh, no.
Oh, no you haven't.

954
01:15:40,724 --> 01:15:43,522
Lucy, I have never been in here
before in my life!

955
01:15:43,628 --> 01:15:46,825
Tell me, are you still living
on the top of Highland Avenue?

956
01:15:46,932 --> 01:15:52,700
Oh, that steep hill? Oh, Lucy,
what a hill for you to climb!

957
01:15:52,804 --> 01:15:55,898
And in your condition, too,
you know.

958
01:15:56,008 --> 01:16:00,104
Oh, you just come in here nightly
for one shot to send you up the hill!

959
01:16:00,212 --> 01:16:01,736
Oh, I see.
Mm-hmm.

960
01:16:01,847 --> 01:16:04,146
Oh, I must be getting home
and get those potatoes on.

961
01:16:04,283 --> 01:16:09,119
I want to have a wonderful meal for
Chesley when he comes home from the office.

962
01:16:09,221 --> 01:16:11,383
I have celery for him.

963
01:16:11,491 --> 01:16:14,392
I have fresh vegetables
for him.

964
01:16:14,494 --> 01:16:17,463
I have a big goose
for him.

965
01:16:17,564 --> 01:16:21,295
I- Lucy, what did you do,
order another one?

966
01:16:21,402 --> 01:16:23,893
But you know
I never touch-

967
01:16:24,005 --> 01:16:25,939
Lucy, I never-

968
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,703
Oh, I guess it being a special
occasion it wouldn't hurt.

969
01:16:28,811 --> 01:16:31,905
well, down the hatch.

970
01:16:39,655 --> 01:16:43,491
You know, that wasn't
as strong as the first one.

971
01:16:43,593 --> 01:16:45,959
( Sighs )
Eighteen years.

972
01:16:46,063 --> 01:16:50,432
Eighteen wonderful years
with Chesley.

973
01:16:50,534 --> 01:16:54,562
( whistling )
So you can see just-

974
01:16:54,672 --> 01:16:56,937
( whistling )
So you can see just-

975
01:16:57,041 --> 01:16:59,636
Excuse me, Lucy.

976
01:17:02,648 --> 01:17:04,617
( whistling )
So you can see just-

977
01:17:04,717 --> 01:17:08,153
That makes me so mad.
I just paid €17.50!

978
01:17:08,254 --> 01:17:11,781
They shouldn't whistle
back at me like that.

979
01:17:11,924 --> 01:17:14,621
whee!

980
01:17:20,634 --> 01:17:24,126
Lucy, do you find it
kind of warm in here?

981
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:26,729
I don't think this place
is air-conditioned.

982
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,546
Lucy, I think I-

983
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:39,553
I think I'm gonna be
all right.

984
01:17:44,794 --> 01:17:47,820
No, it's nothing you've said. Lucy,
it's nothing you've said, dear.

985
01:17:47,964 --> 01:17:51,296
I'll be all right
in just a minute.

986
01:17:51,401 --> 01:17:56,498
I was just thinking.
Eighteen years!

987
01:17:56,607 --> 01:18:00,064
Eighteen years
with Chesley.

988
01:18:00,178 --> 01:18:03,341
Now I can speak
the truth.

989
01:18:03,448 --> 01:18:07,942
It's been 18
horrible years!

990
01:18:08,052 --> 01:18:13,514
I work and slave over
that hot stove all day long...

991
01:18:13,625 --> 01:18:17,686
while he works down
in that nice, cool sewer.

992
01:18:20,967 --> 01:18:25,301
The only thing he's bought me
in the last year,

993
01:18:25,405 --> 01:18:28,340
in the last year,

994
01:18:28,442 --> 01:18:31,502
is this stinking hat!

995
01:18:32,846 --> 01:18:37,181
Oh, dear, I must get home
and get those potatoes on.

996
01:18:37,285 --> 01:18:40,879
Lucy, let's you and I go somewhere
where it's peaceful and quiet.

997
01:18:40,989 --> 01:18:44,788
No noise, no music,
just peace and quiet.

998
01:18:44,893 --> 01:18:48,829
I'd like to tell you
the story of my life.

999
01:18:48,930 --> 01:18:52,094
Let's go to
the Three Deuces.

1000
01:18:52,235 --> 01:18:54,829
what, dear?
The what?

1001
01:18:54,971 --> 01:19:00,773
The potatoes? Oh, to heck with the
potatoes! I'm getting out of here.

1002
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:04,346
Come on, dear.

1003
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:06,211
( whistles )

1004
01:19:10,088 --> 01:19:13,352
Nita!
Oh, Tony.

1005
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:17,360
Am I glad
to see you.

1006
01:19:17,462 --> 01:19:20,364
what's the matter with you? with me?

1007
01:19:20,466 --> 01:19:21,899
Oh!

1008
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,902
Oh, darling.

1009
01:19:27,273 --> 01:19:30,072
where's Johnny?
In the office.

1010
01:19:30,177 --> 01:19:32,873
How's Mary?
Oh, she-

1011
01:19:32,979 --> 01:19:36,608
Tony, I have so much to
tell you. Order me a drink.

1012
01:19:36,716 --> 01:19:39,550
Yeah.

1013
01:19:41,988 --> 01:19:44,650
( Knocking )

1014
01:19:47,161 --> 01:19:49,357
Nita!

1015
01:19:49,463 --> 01:19:53,366
what are you doin' in Chicago?
what am I doin' in Chicago?

1016
01:19:53,468 --> 01:19:56,335
Don't you read the papers? Just the
racing form. You running at Arlington?

1017
01:19:56,438 --> 01:20:00,000
Oh,Johnny. I'm in the show,
Heat Wave, with Mary and Jed.

1018
01:20:02,579 --> 01:20:06,413
Oh. Didn"t you know we open here Monday?

1019
01:20:06,516 --> 01:20:09,611
I read about it somewhere.

1020
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:12,119
You're sure lookin' swell.
Things been goin' all right?

1021
01:20:12,222 --> 01:20:15,920
Fine,Johnny. And you?
All right.

1022
01:20:16,026 --> 01:20:18,494
Are you coming
to the opening?

1023
01:20:18,596 --> 01:20:23,829
I'd like to catch it,
but, uh-

1024
01:20:23,935 --> 01:20:28,031
New cafe and new help, I really
oughta stand by here and help out.

1025
01:20:31,077 --> 01:20:32,635
Johnny?
Hmm?

1026
01:20:32,778 --> 01:20:35,804
The baby's here.
Yeah?

1027
01:20:35,948 --> 01:20:39,851
Gee, she must be gettin' to be a big
girl now. Oh, you wouldn't know her.

1028
01:20:39,986 --> 01:20:42,649
I suppose I wouldn't.

1029
01:20:42,756 --> 01:20:44,917
Mary all right?

1030
01:20:45,025 --> 01:20:48,860
You're still in love with her,
aren't you?

1031
01:20:53,033 --> 01:20:55,002
we're divorced.

1032
01:20:58,506 --> 01:21:00,998
She's in love with you,
Johnny.

1033
01:21:01,109 --> 01:21:03,943
Did she say so?

1034
01:21:04,045 --> 01:21:07,538
She doesn't have to.
Go and see her.

1035
01:21:07,683 --> 01:21:11,245
Oh, Nita, I-

1036
01:21:11,388 --> 01:21:15,790
You'll have to excuse me.
we're really busy here.

1037
01:21:15,891 --> 01:21:18,657
why don't you come in and see us
again sometime? How much do I love you

1038
01:21:18,762 --> 01:21:21,822
Soon, huh?
I'll tell you no lies

1039
01:21:21,933 --> 01:21:24,629
She's staying at
the Sir Francis.

1040
01:21:24,734 --> 01:21:29,934
How deep
is the ocean

1041
01:21:30,042 --> 01:21:35,207
How high
is the sky

1042
01:21:35,314 --> 01:21:39,808
How many times a day
How many times a day

1043
01:21:39,953 --> 01:21:46,552
Do I think of you Do I think of you

1044
01:21:46,658 --> 01:21:49,651
How many roses

1045
01:21:49,762 --> 01:21:56,565
Are sprinkled with dew

1046
01:21:56,670 --> 01:22:02,040
How far
would I travel

1047
01:22:02,143 --> 01:22:06,944
To be where
you are

1048
01:22:07,048 --> 01:22:12,248
How far
is thejourney

1049
01:22:12,387 --> 01:22:17,450
From here
to a star

1050
01:22:17,593 --> 01:22:23,226
And if I ever
lost you

1051
01:22:23,332 --> 01:22:28,635
How much
would I cry

1052
01:22:28,738 --> 01:22:33,643
How deep
is the ocean

1053
01:22:33,745 --> 01:22:38,682
How high
is the sky

1054
01:22:38,783 --> 01:22:44,188
How deep
is the ocean

1055
01:22:44,288 --> 01:22:50,717
How high
is the sky

1056
01:22:50,864 --> 01:22:53,799
( Doorbell Buzzes )

1057
01:22:55,067 --> 01:22:56,899
Hello, Martha.

1058
01:22:57,003 --> 01:22:59,699
when I heard your voice over
the phone, I couldn't believe it.

1059
01:22:59,807 --> 01:23:04,004
It's so nice to see
you. Thank you, Martha.

1060
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:07,672
Did Mary say what time she's
likely to be back? No, she didn't.

1061
01:23:07,782 --> 01:23:10,615
I suppose the baby's asleep.
Not that one. She's a night owl.

1062
01:23:10,718 --> 01:23:13,186
Could I see her?
Of course.

1063
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:27,527
I think I'd better leave
you two alone. All right.

1064
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:35,834
Hello, Mary Elizabeth. Hello.

1065
01:23:35,945 --> 01:23:38,938
who are you? I'm an old
friend of your mother's.

1066
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:42,985
Good friend?
I hope so.

1067
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:51,219
Now I know who you are.
You do?

1068
01:23:51,363 --> 01:23:54,093
Uh-huh. Mommy showed me
your picture.

1069
01:23:54,232 --> 01:23:57,396
You're my old daddy,
aren't you?

1070
01:23:57,502 --> 01:24:00,063
That's right. I'm pleased to meet you.

1071
01:24:00,173 --> 01:24:02,403
The feeling
is mutual.

1072
01:24:02,508 --> 01:24:04,840
Do I rate a kiss?
Oh, no!

1073
01:24:04,944 --> 01:24:08,574
why not? Mommy says I
mustn't kiss strangers.

1074
01:24:08,682 --> 01:24:11,446
I'm not exactly a stranger. I
knew you when you were that big.

1075
01:24:11,551 --> 01:24:16,387
I must've been very young.
Yes, you were very young.

1076
01:24:16,491 --> 01:24:19,153
Okay,
you can kiss me.

1077
01:24:24,432 --> 01:24:26,663
How 'bout
going to bed now?

1078
01:24:26,802 --> 01:24:29,635
will you tell me a story
first? what kind of a story?

1079
01:24:29,738 --> 01:24:32,901
Do you know the story about
"Running Around in Circles"?

1080
01:24:33,008 --> 01:24:34,999
It's a very good story.

1081
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:37,079
I'm sorry,
I don't know that one.

1082
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:41,640
It's on my piano. Mommy sings
it for me. will you sing it?

1083
01:24:41,751 --> 01:24:45,118
Then will you go to bed? You
got yourself a song. Uh-huh.

1084
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:53,055
It's my piano. UncleJed
gave it to me. UncleJed, huh?

1085
01:24:53,164 --> 01:24:56,293
Your UncleJed's
a pretty nice man.

1086
01:24:57,302 --> 01:25:00,032
This the song here?

1087
01:25:02,508 --> 01:25:05,840
( Humming )

1088
01:25:05,944 --> 01:25:07,378
It's quite a thing.

1089
01:25:07,513 --> 01:25:11,973
( Piano )

1090
01:25:13,352 --> 01:25:16,719
A greyhound
who had lots of speed

1091
01:25:16,822 --> 01:25:19,951
was surely bound
to fail

1092
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:22,621
For morning, noon
and evening

1093
01:25:22,729 --> 01:25:25,893
He'd be chasing
his own tail

1094
01:25:25,999 --> 01:25:30,061
He was running around
in circles

1095
01:25:30,170 --> 01:25:35,302
Running around in circles
getting nowhere

1096
01:25:39,113 --> 01:25:42,311
A squirrel in
a treadmill cage

1097
01:25:42,418 --> 01:25:45,819
Around and 'round
he'd go

1098
01:25:45,922 --> 01:25:48,789
You'd think that
he'd be in a rage

1099
01:25:48,892 --> 01:25:52,055
But seems
he didn't know

1100
01:25:52,162 --> 01:25:56,064
He was running
around in circles

1101
01:25:56,166 --> 01:26:01,799
Running around in circles
getting nowhere

1102
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:08,771
The man who runs
a carrousel

1103
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:12,111
Is often
heavy-hearted

1104
01:26:12,217 --> 01:26:15,482
He rides all day
but sad to say

1105
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:22,551
He winds up
where he started

1106
01:26:22,662 --> 01:26:27,862
So... concentrate
and clear your mind

1107
01:26:27,967 --> 01:26:31,368
Of schemes
that never last

1108
01:26:31,472 --> 01:26:34,532
Or you'll wake up
someday and find

1109
01:26:34,643 --> 01:26:38,044
Your chances
all have passed

1110
01:26:38,179 --> 01:26:42,206
You've been running
around in circles

1111
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:48,152
Running around in circles
getting nowhere

1112
01:26:48,257 --> 01:26:51,714
Getting nowhere

1113
01:26:51,827 --> 01:26:58,757
Very fast

1114
01:27:01,872 --> 01:27:06,742
You're right, honey. That's a very
pretty story. It has a message too.

1115
01:27:06,844 --> 01:27:09,142
You sing nice.
Thank you.

1116
01:27:09,247 --> 01:27:12,945
Can you kick your heels up in
the air? Oh, no, not lately.

1117
01:27:13,084 --> 01:27:15,814
UncleJed can.
I should say he can!

1118
01:27:20,459 --> 01:27:22,586
Do you like
your UncleJed?

1119
01:27:22,695 --> 01:27:26,132
Oh, yes! I was going
to marry him. You were?

1120
01:27:26,231 --> 01:27:28,927
But Mommy is.

1121
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:33,138
She is? Uh-huh. Next week.

1122
01:27:33,239 --> 01:27:37,505
I'm invited to the wedding.
want to see my invitation?

1123
01:27:39,979 --> 01:27:43,074
Isn't that
an invitation?

1124
01:27:44,852 --> 01:27:49,346
That's what it is.
Did you get one?

1125
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:52,015
You better go
to sleep.

1126
01:28:08,011 --> 01:28:11,845
Good-bye, Daddy.
Bye, Mary Elizabeth.

1127
01:28:13,050 --> 01:28:15,746
You mean, right away?

1128
01:28:15,853 --> 01:28:19,551
But... Johnny,
we're doing so well!

1129
01:28:21,059 --> 01:28:24,586
Okay.
I just mentioned it.

1130
01:28:24,730 --> 01:28:26,697
well...

1131
01:28:26,831 --> 01:28:29,129
good luck.

1132
01:28:34,607 --> 01:28:36,940
Tony!
Mary.!

1133
01:28:37,043 --> 01:28:40,569
Darling. Hello,Jed. Hello, Tony.

1134
01:28:41,915 --> 01:28:43,815
Is Johnny here?

1135
01:28:43,917 --> 01:28:46,477
No, he, um-
He isn't?

1136
01:28:46,586 --> 01:28:51,217
He just phoned.
Said he was leaving town.

1137
01:28:53,227 --> 01:28:56,663
As usual, I don't suppose
he said where he was going.

1138
01:28:56,798 --> 01:29:01,361
No, he just said he'd get in touch
with me in a couple of months.

1139
01:29:03,038 --> 01:29:06,566
Too bad. we wanted to ask him
to our wedding. Jed, please.

1140
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:09,668
I'd invite you, Tony, but
it's gonna be a small affair.

1141
01:29:09,778 --> 01:29:13,510
I'm not even sure
the bride will be there.

1142
01:29:13,616 --> 01:29:17,178
Uh... could I get you
a drink? No, thanks.

1143
01:29:17,287 --> 01:29:19,346
well, uh...
I need one.

1144
01:29:19,457 --> 01:29:21,924
Come on, sugar.

1145
01:29:25,229 --> 01:29:27,493
Darling
- I know. I know.

1146
01:29:27,631 --> 01:29:31,432
That two dollars I spent for the
marriage license, shot to pieces.

1147
01:29:31,535 --> 01:29:34,130
Oh, I wish
I didn't love him.

1148
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:36,901
But I guess
I always will.

1149
01:29:38,510 --> 01:29:40,910
I know how it is.

1150
01:29:41,012 --> 01:29:42,913
Oh,Jed!

1151
01:30:00,801 --> 01:30:04,033
( Knocking )
Mary.

1152
01:30:05,673 --> 01:30:07,072
Yes, Dan?

1153
01:30:07,175 --> 01:30:10,168
Maybe you can talk toJed.
He's hittin' the bottle.

1154
01:30:10,278 --> 01:30:13,680
If he ain't steady, that "Heat
wave" dance can be pretty dangerous.

1155
01:30:13,782 --> 01:30:16,444
I have talked to him
and it doesn't help.

1156
01:30:16,552 --> 01:30:19,112
Can't you cut out the
number? I suggested that.

1157
01:30:19,222 --> 01:30:24,716
He just laughed. (Jed ) Is like a melody

1158
01:30:24,828 --> 01:30:26,887
That haunts me

1159
01:30:26,998 --> 01:30:31,264
Come in!
Night and day

1160
01:30:31,401 --> 01:30:35,566
Oh, if it isn't Miss Melody
herself! I was thinking about you.

1161
01:30:35,706 --> 01:30:40,735
A pretty girl is like a melody Jed.

1162
01:30:40,845 --> 01:30:44,304
Remember that night back in
New York? The show was closing?

1163
01:30:44,415 --> 01:30:48,352
Darling, I'm worried about you. Me? why?

1164
01:30:48,453 --> 01:30:50,751
That.
That?

1165
01:30:50,856 --> 01:30:55,021
Oh, that! That's very good.
It's 20 years old.

1166
01:30:55,128 --> 01:30:57,619
Don't you think you oughta cut
out the "Heat wave" number tonight?

1167
01:30:57,730 --> 01:31:02,225
At least the part on top of the
bridge. Silliest thing I ever heard.

1168
01:31:02,336 --> 01:31:04,964
You see that straight line?
You watch.

1169
01:31:05,104 --> 01:31:07,801
( Humming )

1170
01:31:09,243 --> 01:31:10,938
whoops.

1171
01:31:11,046 --> 01:31:13,981
Steady as the
well-known rock.

1172
01:31:16,051 --> 01:31:19,920
Here's to the most beautiful girl
- Please,Jed.

1173
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:28,992
I hear you're leaving
the show. Saturday.

1174
01:31:29,098 --> 01:31:32,660
Saturday.

1175
01:31:32,768 --> 01:31:35,965
well, what do you
think of that?

1176
01:31:37,407 --> 01:31:40,673
That calls for a final drink. No,Jed.

1177
01:31:40,811 --> 01:31:44,713
Oh, yes,Jed.
And oh, yes, Mary.

1178
01:31:44,816 --> 01:31:46,716
Gotta have
a final drink.

1179
01:31:46,818 --> 01:31:50,083
In fact, it's the final,
final, final drink.

1180
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:00,557
Please be careful.

1181
01:32:02,168 --> 01:32:03,998
Of course
I'll be careful.

1182
01:32:04,104 --> 01:32:06,766
I'll be
very careful.

1183
01:32:21,088 --> 01:32:23,387
( Knocking ) Five minutes, Mr. Potter.

1184
01:32:23,491 --> 01:32:25,119
Right.

1185
01:32:46,149 --> 01:32:50,246
( Man ) A heat wave blew
right into town last week

1186
01:32:54,191 --> 01:32:57,821
She came from the
island of Martinique

1187
01:33:02,434 --> 01:33:07,065
( Nita ) The cancan she
dances will make you fry

1188
01:33:15,582 --> 01:33:20,418
The cancan is really
the reason why

1189
01:33:21,755 --> 01:33:24,986
we're having
a heat wave

1190
01:33:25,093 --> 01:33:28,290
A tropical heat wave

1191
01:33:28,396 --> 01:33:31,559
The temperature's rising
It isn't surprising

1192
01:33:31,666 --> 01:33:34,897
She certainly can...
cancan

1193
01:33:35,003 --> 01:33:38,200
She started
the heat wave

1194
01:33:38,307 --> 01:33:41,539
By letting
her feet wave

1195
01:33:41,643 --> 01:33:44,772
And in such a way that
the customers say that

1196
01:33:44,881 --> 01:33:48,248
She certainly can...
cancan

1197
01:33:48,351 --> 01:33:54,018
Gee, her anatomy

1198
01:33:54,157 --> 01:33:57,491
Made the mercury

Jump to 93

1200
01:33:59,764 --> 01:34:04,758
Yes, sir
We"re having a heat wave

1201
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:08,135
A tropical heat wave

1202
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:11,334
The way that she moves that
thermometer proves that

1203
01:34:11,443 --> 01:34:15,038
She certainly can...
cancan

1204
01:34:15,148 --> 01:34:18,208
( Chorus ) It's so hot the
weatherman will tell you

1205
01:34:18,317 --> 01:34:21,684
A record's been made

1206
01:34:21,788 --> 01:34:24,087
It's so hot
a coat of tan

1207
01:34:24,190 --> 01:34:28,456
will cover your face
in the shade

Lost 20 pounds
from each side

1210
01:34:35,303 --> 01:34:39,296
It's so hot a chicken
laid an egg in the street

1211
01:34:39,407 --> 01:34:41,841
And it fried

1212
01:34:41,943 --> 01:34:45,209
we're having
a heat wave

1213
01:34:45,313 --> 01:34:48,544
A tropical
heat wave

1214

The temperature's rising
It isn't surprising

She certainly can...
cancan

01:40:09,736 --> 01:40:11,762
Here comes
the freedom man

1230
01:40:11,871 --> 01:40:16,866
Asking you to buy a share
of freedom today

1231
01:40:19,047 --> 01:40:22,914
This is the army
Mr. Jones

1232
01:40:23,017 --> 01:40:26,886
No private rooms
or telephones

1233
01:40:26,988 --> 01:40:30,116
You had your breakfast
in bed before

1234
01:40:30,225 --> 01:40:34,754
But you won't have it
there anymore

1235
01:40:34,897 --> 01:40:38,765
This is the army
Mr. Green

1236
01:40:38,869 --> 01:40:42,669
we likes the barracks
nice and clean

1237
01:40:42,773 --> 01:40:46,038
You had a housemaid
to clean your floor

1238
01:40:46,143 --> 01:40:49,408
But she won't
help you out anymore

1239
01:40:52,217 --> 01:41:01,649
I'm dreaming
of a white Christmas

1240
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:08,962
with every Christmas card
I write

1241
01:41:09,102 --> 01:41:20,741
May your days
be merry and bright

1242
01:41:20,848 --> 01:41:29,881
And my all your Christmases
be white

1243
01:41:32,660 --> 01:41:35,494
well, that's our story
as far as it goes.

1244
01:41:35,597 --> 01:41:39,158
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I have a little surprise.

1245
01:41:39,301 --> 01:41:43,761
It just so happens that that certain
Johnny Adams is in the studio with me.

1246
01:41:43,905 --> 01:41:46,669
I wonder, um-
Johnny?

1247
01:41:46,776 --> 01:41:50,338
Yes,Jed? How"d you like to put
a nice finish to this story?

1248
01:41:50,446 --> 01:41:53,472
I'll try.

1249
01:41:53,584 --> 01:41:59,113
You keep coming back

1250
01:41:59,223 --> 01:42:01,350
Like a song

1251
01:42:04,061 --> 01:42:09,864
A song
that keeps saying

1252
01:42:09,968 --> 01:42:12,164
Remember

1253
01:42:14,506 --> 01:42:20,139
The sweet
used-to-be

1254
01:42:20,246 --> 01:42:26,082
That was once
you and me

1255
01:42:26,185 --> 01:42:30,350
Keeps coming back

1256
01:42:30,457 --> 01:42:35,691
Like an old melody

1257
01:42:35,797 --> 01:42:44,001
The perfume of roses in
May Blue skies smiling at me

1258
01:42:44,105 --> 01:42:51,103
Nothing but blue skies
Returns to my room

1259
01:42:55,919 --> 01:42:58,979
From out of the past

1260
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:05,358
Where forgotten things
belong

1261
01:43:05,463 --> 01:43:09,900
You keep coming back

1262
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,595
Like a song
