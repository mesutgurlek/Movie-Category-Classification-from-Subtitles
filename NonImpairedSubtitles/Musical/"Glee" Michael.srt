1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:02,590
Admit it, Wonder twins,
the only reason why the New Direction

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,547
beat the Trouble Tones at Sectionals

3
00:00:04,667 --> 00:00:06,480
is because that pervy clown judge

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,816
was freaking high as a kite.

5
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:10,831
And we did Michael Jackson.
You guys didn't.

6
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:13,404
That was weeks ago.
Why are you still obssessing?

7
00:00:13,524 --> 00:00:16,725
- One word, Kurt. Michael.
- Guys, fear not.

8
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:19,727
The world tour of the Cirque du Soleil
tribute show, Immortal, to Michael Jackson

9
00:00:19,847 --> 00:00:21,986
is coming to Columbus in June.
We should all go.

10
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:25,339
You don't get it. I don't want to see
the spectacle that is Michael.

11
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,438
I want to be the spectacle.

12
00:00:27,558 --> 00:00:30,649
- Everything okay? - Look, we love being
back in New Direction, but...

13
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:34,019
- We hate that we missed our chance
this year to do Michael. - Yeah, I get it.

14
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:35,824
And I've been thinking a lot about
Regionals and...

15
00:00:35,944 --> 00:00:37,446
maybe we can do Michael again.

16
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:40,247
I for one know exactly what song
we should start Michael with.

17

18
00:03:11,353 --> 00:03:14,571
Okay, it's been exactly 3 days to
the minute since I proposed to you

19
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:16,241
which is the amount of
time you said you needed

20
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:17,258
before you'd give me an answer.

21
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:18,464
Look, this isn't the kind of decision

22
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,582
you can make on a deadline.

23
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,250
Look, I understand,
you said you needed

24
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:22,868
some time, but...
not hearing a decision's

25
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,086
kind of bumming me out.

26
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:25,555
No. Look...

27
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,039
I love you, okay?

28
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,842
And... I want to
marry you <i>someday,</i>

29
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:32,211
and... I, really,
I'm open to anything.

30
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:34,213
This is all just happening so fast,

31
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:35,898
and I don't understand it.

32
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:38,351
I mean, I... I need you
to help me understand.

33
00:03:38,402 --> 00:03:39,552
Okay, well,

34
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:41,103
even if you don't get into NYADA,

35
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,655
you're still gonna go to New York.

36
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,723
Yes, and I want you to come with me.
And I will,

37
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:47,160
but... we're crazy if we think
that it's gonna be easier

38
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,028
to be a couple there than it is here.

39
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,563
My point is that

40
00:03:50,614 --> 00:03:52,582
those rings are-are...

41
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,500
will always be a reminder

42
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,452
of exactly how we feel right now.

43
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:58,671
They're gonna let us take a piece of
our little world into the big city.

44
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,623
Look, that's really romantic,

45
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,793
but I have to be honest-- this all
just sounds really crazy to me, okay?

46
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:07,597
I don't need to marry you to keep from
straying-- you're the only guy for me.

47
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,802
Okay, I guess...
my answer for now is...

48
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,804
No, no, don't...
don't say anything.

49
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:17,106
You're right, we shouldn't make this
kind of a decision on a deadline.

50
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:18,774
Just, uh...

51
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,092
take a couple more days, okay?

52
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:29,452
(piano playing "I Just Can't
Stop Loving You")

53
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:30,953
(bell rings)

54
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:33,206
Okay, favorite
Michael Jackson memory. Go.

55
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,125
When I was one, my mom showed me the
VHS tape of his Motown special,

56
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,160
and when he did the
moonwalk across the stage

57
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:41,297
for the first time in history,
I uttered my first words:

58
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,217
"Hot damn." I owe the King of
Pop a deep debt of gratitude.

59
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,785
He was the first one to pull off
the sequined military jacket,

60
00:04:46,837 --> 00:04:49,088
long before one Kurt Hummel
made it iconic.

61
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,724
I have to be honest--
I never really got him.

62
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,309
And we are no longer
on speaking terms.

63
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,960
No, I think he's
an amazing performer, but I've

64
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:56,629
never really
just got what he was about.

65
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,631
Rachel, he was best friends with
Liza Minnelli and Liz Taylor.

66
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:01,234
No, all I'm saying is that
I-I just... I haven't connected

67
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,568
with him the way that
I have with the likes of Barbra

68
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,569
or either of the Stephens.

69
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,571
Sondheim. Schwartz.

70
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,906
I'd throw this mocha in your face,

71
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,474
but it's not nearly scalding enough.

72
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:11,143
Okay, but just, since you guys
are so jazzed about him,

73
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:12,411
I think it's a good idea.

74
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,248
Well, that might not be the best idea.

75
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,333
Hey, Blaine.
Hello, everyone else.

76
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,502
Does he live here or something?
Seriously, you are always here.

77
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:20,920
Why don't you think
that's a good idea?

78
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,538
Because we're doing MJ for Regionals.

79
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:23,822
You see, Warblers drew first position,

80
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:25,625
so as soon as I heard what

81
00:05:25,676 --> 00:05:27,660
your plan was, I changed
our set list accordingly.

82
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:29,345
I'm sorry, how...
how did you hear?

83
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,996
Uh, Blaine told me this morning.

84
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:33,432
I just called for a tip on how to get

85
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,051
red wine out
of my blazer piping, and he

86
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,169
would not stop going on about it.

87
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,721
I may have mentioned it.

88
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,389
How often do you talk?
Oh, my God, hey, Kurt.

89
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:41,557
I didn't recognize you.

90
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:42,858
You are wearing boy clothes for once.

91
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,009
All right, twink,

92
00:05:44,061 --> 00:05:45,861
I think it's time that I show you

93
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,229
a little Lima Heights hospitality.

94
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,515
Unless you want to join
your relatives in prison,

95
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:51,367
that's probably not the best idea.

96
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,370
You see, my dad is sort of what
you'd call a state's attorney.

97
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,405
But if you had a piñata
you wanted delivered,

98
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,741
I bet he could make
sure that got to them.

99
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,359
All right, so here's
what you guys should know.

100
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,027
I am captain of the Warblers now,

101
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,479
and I'm tired of playing nice.

102
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,383
There has to be some kind

103
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,502
of show choir competition
committee we can complain to.

104
00:06:09,553 --> 00:06:12,088
I know it sucks, guys, but
it's not the end of the world.

105
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,473
Heck, you had your set list
stolen the day of the competition

106
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,143
at Sectionals, and you
pulled that one off, right?

107
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,145
Well, they can have our
<i>Journey</i> and our <i>Dreamgirls,</i>

108
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,214
but pilfering my Michael, mm-mm,
that's another level, not okay.

109
00:06:22,265 --> 00:06:25,318
I'm not exactly comfortable having this
conversation with Blaine in the room.

110
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,386
Clearly, once a Warbler,
always a Warbler.

111
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:29,989
Uh, wh-what? Dude, you told
them what we were gonna do.

112
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,774
You're like a modern-day
Eggs Benedict. He's on notice

113
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,025
as far as I'm concerned.

114
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:35,328
FINN: We should all
be on notice. I mean,

115
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,445
next to Vocal Adrenaline, the Warblers

116
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,997
are the best Glee Club in the state,

117
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,282
and for a lot of us, this is
our last shot at a championship,

118
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:41,867
so we should stop complaining

119
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:44,203
about the Warblers
and figure out how to beat them.

120
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:45,504
I couldn't have said it
better myself, Finn.

121
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,289
I'm less worried about
our set list right now

122
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:49,425
and more interested in getting
us in the right mindset

123
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,843
to crush those guys.

124
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,262
Which is why our
lesson for the week is...

125
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:59,719
What Would Michael Jackson Do?

126
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,137
He'd fight back.

127
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,356
He'd say Regionals is ours,
MJ is ours,

128
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,775
and if they want it, they can pry it

129
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,093
from o sequin-gloved hand.
Mm-hmm. Straight up.

130
00:07:08,145 --> 00:07:10,780
In 1983, MTV said they wouldn't
air his "Billie Jean" video.

131
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,398
What'd he do?
He fought back.

132
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:14,316
They aired it, and the <i>Thriller</i> album

133
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,152
sold an additional ten million copies.

134
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,604
That's right.
I know what Michael would do.

135
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:21,407
I think he would take it
to the streets.

136
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,459
(intro to "Billie Jean" plays)

137
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,049
Well... we're here.

138
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,300
We got something to settle.

139
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:33,252
Both of us want to use MJ,

140
00:07:33,303 --> 00:07:34,754
but only one can.
We're having

141
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:35,988
a Jackson-off,
Nick at Nite.

142
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,339
Winner gets
the King of Pop for Regionals.

143
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,642
What, us against...
the two of you?

144
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:40,893
You really think you're that bad?

145
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,061
Is that what they teach you

146
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,396
at that little public school of yours?

147
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,897
It's time to see who's bad.

148
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:45,631
(snaps fingers)

149
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:50,736

into intro to "Bad")

Is he okay?

Uh, it's his right eye.

214
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,869
Uh, the doctor says that
his cornea is deeply scratched

215
00:10:20,937 --> 00:10:23,239
and he has to have surgery.

216
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,152
In all my years as
a teacher and a student,

217
00:10:25,272 --> 00:10:26,942
I have never known a slushee

218
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,577
to do <i>that</i> kind of damage.

219
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,746
That's 'cause it wasn't
a normal slushee, Mr. Shue.

220
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,249
There was... stuff in it,
rocks or something.

221
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,117
He <i>wanted</i> to do that damage.

222
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,670
Well, unless you have proof that
he tampered with the slushee

223
00:10:37,754 --> 00:10:39,454
the police aren't interested
in getting involved.

224
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:40,889
Sebastian is evil.

225
00:10:40,957 --> 00:10:42,925
He needs to be expelled.

226
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,227
Look, Figgins and I spoke
to Dalton's headmaster.

227
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:46,729
They're opening up an investigation.

228
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:48,147
So, guys, I'm telling you,

229
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,132
please let the system handle this one.

230
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:53,736
No. Dalton's old-school, Mr.
Shue-- they're not gonna turn their backs

231
00:10:53,803 --> 00:10:55,637
on one of their own-- we need payback.
An eye for an eye.

232
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,973
No. I have a zero-tolerance
policy for violence,

233
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,141
of any kind.

234
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,843
That's not how we do things.

235
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,811
No, we sing, and
that's all we ever do.

236
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,479
Do you want to get
disqualified from Regionals?

237
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,665
I don't give a damn about Regionals.

238
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,317
What do you expect
from us? We're people.

239
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,918
I know the rest of the world

240
00:11:09,986 --> 00:11:11,954
may not see us like that,
but when they tease us

241
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,005
and throw stuff at us

242
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,290
and toss us in Dumpsters

243
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,591
and tell us that we're
nothing but losers

244
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:17,543
with stupid dreams, it freaking hurts.

245
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:19,511
And we're supposed to
turn the other cheek

246
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,163
and be the bigger man
by telling ourselves

247
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,998
that those dreams and how hard we work

248
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,266
make us better than them,

249
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:25,567
but it gets pretty damn hard to feel

250
00:11:25,635 --> 00:11:27,002
that way when they always get to win.

251
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,771
I get how upsetting this is for you.

252
00:11:28,838 --> 00:11:30,189
No, you don't,

253
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,007
and don't give me any of
that "it gets better" crap

254
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,525
because I'm not interested
in it getting any better.

255
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,527
I want it to be better,
like, right now.

256
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,147
I want to hurt them
the way they hurt us.

No, worse.

258
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:41,116
I want them to feel my pain

259
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:44,186

Artie? Artie.

313
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,141
I think I better roll away.

314
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,567
(school bell ringing)

315
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:30,235
Hey.

316
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,737
Look, I need your advice,

317
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:35,290
all right, about,
about an adult problem.

318
00:14:35,358 --> 00:14:36,658
Holy crap, are you pregnant? No.

319
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,693
Look, I'm, I'm coming
to you as a friend

320
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:39,995
and, oddly, because I also think

321
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,380
that you're the only
person that'll give me

322
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,298
just a, a straightforward

323
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:44,666
and a thoughtful answer about this.

324
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,884
You're right, I'm sorry.

325
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,136
Yes, I can keep a secret.

326
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:52,307
Okay... well, um...

327
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,761
Finn asked me to marry him.

328
00:14:55,845 --> 00:14:57,879
(gasps)

329
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,314
What did you say?

330
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:01,650
I said I-I needed
to think about it.

331
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,820
Well, you can't.

332
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:05,904
Why?

333
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,322
I mean, plenty of people

334
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,241
get married at our age,
and, I mean, I know that

335
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,776
he and I haven't lived together
or anything,

336
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,080
but, you know, I love him
and he's the one, I know it.

337
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,901
What's this?

338
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:21,503
My ticket out of here.

339
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:23,422
I got into Yale, early admissions.

340
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,542
Turns out my essay
about overcoming adversity

341
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,877
while maintaining
a straight-A average

342
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,245
during a teen pregnancy
really turned on

343
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,763
the admissions boards.

344
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,966
Quinn, that's amazing.

345
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,418
That's so great.

346
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,936
That's great.

347
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,688
I'm sure you'll get
your NYADA one soon.

348
00:15:39,755 --> 00:15:41,139
Oh, yeah, I mean, New York mail

349
00:15:41,224 --> 00:15:43,725
is notoriously slow, so it's...

350
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,894
My point being is that

351
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,281
I've dated Finn, Puck, Sam.

352
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,732
Even thought I loved some of them,

353
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,484
but by the time

354
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:56,771
the snow falls in New Haven
next winter, I won't know why.

355
00:15:56,823 --> 00:16:00,459
So are, are you saying that
Finn and I should break up?

356
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,378
I'm all for making the most
of the next few months,

357
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:04,580
but I'd hate the idea

358
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,615
o-of dragging
an anchor from my past

359
00:16:06,683 --> 00:16:08,584
into the bright lights of my future.

360
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:12,504
Rachel, you have
an amazing life ahead of you.

361
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:14,089
As hard as it may be,

362
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,892
if you want everything
that you've ever dreamed of,

363
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,461
you're going to have
to break up with him.

364
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,179
That's an awful thing to say. Look,

365
00:16:21,264 --> 00:16:23,015
you wanted straight and thoughtful.

366
00:16:23,099 --> 00:16:24,516
I guess at one point

367
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:26,268
it made sense to love somebody
for your whole life,

368
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,486
but it doesn't anymore.

369
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,638
Women are finding themselves
in their 30s now.

370
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,640
Every magazine says it.
We hardly know

371
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,742
what we're going to want in 15 years.

372
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:35,494
I mean, Finn and I--
we can grow together.

373
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:40,315
Look, Rachel... you and Finn
are a lovely couple.

374
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,419
But if you really want to be happy,

375
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:47,122
you're going to have
to say good-bye.

Even more incredible is her big news.

432

Tell them.

433
00:19:14,771 --> 00:19:16,488
I got into Yale.

00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,639
(laughs)

435
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,824
Yale.

436
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,108
Whoo!

437
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,330
It's just--
it-it's amazing.

438
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,481
After everything you've been through,

439
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:27,532
you really deserve this, Quinn.

440
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:28,950
MERCEDES:
We are so proud

441
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,035
of you, Quinn.

442
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:33,154
I want to thank you guys...

443
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,340
because without each
and every one of you,

444
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,875
this would have never happened.

445
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:39,294
You supported me and loved me

446
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:43,164
through all the drama, and
that's why I'm standing here.

447
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,684
I wasted so much time hating myself

448
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,135
for the stupid mistakes that I made,

449
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,939
but the truth is, is that

450
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:53,141
without all of those,

451
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,477
I never would have dreamed this
to be my future.

452
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,181
I was the only one standing
in the way of myself.

453
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:05,120
You can't change your past...

454
00:20:05,187 --> 00:20:09,624
but you can let go
and start your future.

455
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:11,626
Yale, yeah.

456
00:20:11,694 --> 00:20:13,528
(excited chatter)

457
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,632
Yale!
Oh, my God!

458
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:23,312
(school bell ringing)

459
00:20:29,468 --> 00:20:31,970
Hey, what are you doing?

460
00:20:32,021 --> 00:20:33,138
Trying to keep the flames

461
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:34,939
from shooting
out of the side of my face.

462
00:20:35,007 --> 00:20:36,638
Well, that outfit isn't helping.

463
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:39,227
I agree with Artie.

464
00:20:39,581 --> 00:20:41,382
I'm tired of being
stepped on all the time.

465
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,002
I take a lot of crap from
a lot of people, but I refuse

466
00:20:44,086 --> 00:20:46,587
to take it from Sebastian
the Criminal Chipmunk,

467
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:48,756
so I've been sitting here
for the last hour,

468
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:50,675
making a list of ways
to get back at him.

469
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:53,177
Well, today is your lucky
day, because Auntie Snixx

470
00:20:53,262 --> 00:20:55,129
just arrived on the Bitchtown Express.

471
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,181
Now, my suggestion is that we drag him

472
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:58,650
bound and gagged to a tattoo parlor

473
00:20:58,734 --> 00:21:01,853
for a tramp stamp that
reads "Tips Appreciated" or

474
00:21:01,937 --> 00:21:04,022
"Congratulations, You're
My 1,000th Customer!"

475
00:21:04,106 --> 00:21:07,542
After what he did to Blaine,
I really wanted

476
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:10,028
to hurt him.

477
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:11,446
But I can't.

478
00:21:11,497 --> 00:21:13,364
I've fought against violence
at this school for too long.

479
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:16,150
I, I have to take the high road.

480
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:17,168
You know what, Prancy Smurf?

481
00:21:17,252 --> 00:21:18,652
I respect that.

482
00:21:18,704 --> 00:21:20,538
You're probably right.
I want to go to a college

483
00:21:20,622 --> 00:21:22,656
that isn't a FEMA trailer
in a prison yard,

484
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,342
so let's take the high road.

485
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:26,928
We're not going to beat
Sebastian by playing dirty...

486
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:29,347
but we are going to beat him.

487
00:21:29,431 --> 00:21:31,883
(school bell ringing)

488
00:21:36,805 --> 00:21:38,940
You know why I like this
week's assignment so much?

489
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,559
Hands down, without a doubt,
one of my favorite singers

490
00:21:41,643 --> 00:21:42,643
of all time is Michael Jackson.

491
00:21:42,695 --> 00:21:43,811
Listen, if I have to hawk

492
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:45,346
my weave on eBay, I'm going to see

493
00:21:45,397 --> 00:21:46,514
the <i>Immortal</i> tour
when it comes to Ohio.

494
00:21:46,565 --> 00:21:48,349
Speaking of immortal...

495
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:52,120
Since we're gonna be seeing
your name up in lights

496
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,705
for the rest of our lives, I thought

497
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:55,039
we might as well start today.

498
00:21:55,124 --> 00:21:56,624
Sam Evans,

499
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,292
you are crazy.

500
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,194
Crazy about you.

501
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:03,864
You know, we've never
sang a duet together.

502
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,500
I thought we could do
"Human Nature."

503
00:22:06,668 --> 00:22:07,552
Would you sing with me?

504
00:22:07,636 --> 00:22:09,721
After that you can

505
00:22:09,805 --> 00:22:11,055
go back to Shane;
I won't stop you.

506
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,008
Sam, I can't.

507
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:14,892
Let's...

508
00:22:14,977 --> 00:22:16,144
Let's talk later.

509
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:19,981

So...
Will?

557
00:24:49,298 --> 00:24:50,164
(whispering)

558
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:53,751
Kurt?

559
00:24:53,835 --> 00:24:55,720
Your dad wants to talk to you.

560
00:24:55,804 --> 00:24:57,004
What's wrong?
Is Blaine okay?

561
00:24:57,055 --> 00:24:58,038
He's fine.

562
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:01,208
The mail came.

563
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,710
NYADA.

564
00:25:02,778 --> 00:25:05,212
(school bell ringing)
Dude, come on.

565
00:25:05,264 --> 00:25:07,064
This is like the fifth
room we've been to.

566
00:25:07,149 --> 00:25:09,200
What's wrong with the
library or the lunchroom?

567
00:25:09,268 --> 00:25:10,401
None of those felt right.

568
00:25:10,485 --> 00:25:12,219
This is it, Dad.

569
00:25:12,271 --> 00:25:14,438
This is one of those
crossroad moments in life.

570
00:25:14,523 --> 00:25:16,107
I mean, whatever's in this
envelope is going to determine

571
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:17,825
whether I go right or left.

572
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:20,060
I'm here, no matter what it says.

573
00:25:20,112 --> 00:25:21,946
Okay?

574
00:25:29,087 --> 00:25:30,705
(whispering)
"Dear Mr. Hummel..."

575
00:25:33,008 --> 00:25:34,842
(sighs)

576
00:25:36,762 --> 00:25:38,679
What? What?

577
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:40,932
I'm a finalist.

578
00:25:41,016 --> 00:25:42,883
(laughs)

579
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:46,804
Oh, Dad, Dad, your heart.

580
00:25:46,888 --> 00:25:48,589
Oh, screw my heart!
You did it!

581
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,107
You did it, Kurt!

582
00:25:50,192 --> 00:25:51,475
Oh, man, oh!

583
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,861
Who's gonna tell Blaine?
You got to let me do it.

584
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:54,895
Dad, are you crying?

585
00:25:54,947 --> 00:25:56,113
You beat them all.

586
00:25:56,198 --> 00:25:58,449
They threw everything at you.

587
00:25:58,533 --> 00:26:00,234
They tried to beat you down.

588
00:26:00,285 --> 00:26:02,286
But you know what?
You're unstoppable, Kurt.

589
00:26:02,371 --> 00:26:04,372
I am so proud to be your dad.

590
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:07,959
They can never
take this away from you.

591
00:26:08,043 --> 00:26:11,212
Right now, in this moment,

592
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,298
on this day, you won.

593
00:26:14,383 --> 00:26:16,250
(laughs)

594
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:19,503
Oh, way to go, dude.

595
00:26:19,588 --> 00:26:20,888
(school bell rings)

596
00:26:24,343 --> 00:26:25,776
KURT:
Rachel! Rachel!

597
00:26:25,844 --> 00:26:27,311
I got it; I got my NYADA letter.

598
00:26:27,396 --> 00:26:28,813
I got in the finals.
You did?

599
00:26:28,897 --> 00:26:31,232
I'm a finalist.
You did? That's so great.

600
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,584
Wh-What did yours say?

601
00:26:33,652 --> 00:26:35,486
I didn't get one.

602
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:38,856
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.

603
00:26:38,924 --> 00:26:41,459
That just means they
haven't sent it yet.

604
00:26:41,526 --> 00:26:43,294
I didn't even make it to the finals.

605
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,531
(voice breaking):
I knew it, I...

606
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:52,069
(sighs) I had this weird feeling
in my stomach all week long.

607
00:26:52,137 --> 00:26:54,455
Rachel, don't be stupid.

608
00:26:54,506 --> 00:26:55,322
"Stupid"?

609
00:26:57,376 --> 00:26:59,326
Stupid is watching all of your friends

610
00:26:59,378 --> 00:27:01,045
make plans for their future

611
00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:03,997
and realizing that
you have none at all.

612
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:06,150
No plans, no college,

613
00:27:06,218 --> 00:27:08,436
nowhere to go.

614
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:11,972
All I have here is
my boyfriend, and...

615
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:15,342
And I have no idea what I'm doing.

616
00:27:16,812 --> 00:27:18,446
(sighs)

617
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:19,730
Come here.

618
00:27:19,815 --> 00:27:21,532
(sobs)

619
00:27:21,616 --> 00:27:24,452
It's all right.

620
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,287
(school bell ringing)

621
00:27:28,138 --> 00:27:30,708
"Miss Jolier,
a dramatic directorial debut,"

622
00:27:30,828 --> 00:27:33,729
"she expects her second feature to
have far more honey than blood."

623
00:27:34,358 --> 00:27:35,858
BLAINE:
Hey.

624
00:27:35,943 --> 00:27:36,880
Hey, guys.

625
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,530
We brought you, um,
chicken noodle soup.

626
00:27:38,605 --> 00:27:41,089
I know it's not used to
typically help eye injuries,

627
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,224
but we figured it

628
00:27:42,275 --> 00:27:43,725
couldn't hurt.
And I brought you

629
00:27:43,776 --> 00:27:46,812
a couple of eye-patch-featuring

630
00:27:46,896 --> 00:27:50,449
I got, uh, <i>Pirates of the</i>
<i>Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,</i>

631
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:52,934
<i>Valkyrie,</i> and <i>Sky Captain</i>
<i>and the World of Tomorrow.</i>

632
00:27:52,986 --> 00:27:54,036
Aw, thank you guys.

633
00:27:54,103 --> 00:27:56,104
It's so amazing;
It really means

634
00:27:56,155 --> 00:27:58,206
a lot to me that you'd come
by to check up on me.

635
00:27:58,274 --> 00:27:59,241
However,

636
00:27:59,292 --> 00:28:00,959
I cannot let a single moment pass

637
00:28:01,044 --> 00:28:03,495
without first...

638
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,131
raising a zero-calorie toast

639
00:28:06,215 --> 00:28:07,799
(can pops)
to one Mr. Kurt Hummel, aka...

640
00:28:07,884 --> 00:28:08,667
NYADA finalist.

641
00:28:08,751 --> 00:28:10,586
Yay.

642
00:28:12,088 --> 00:28:13,355
Cheers.

643
00:28:14,657 --> 00:28:16,425
So, Blaine, uh, when's the surgery?

644
00:28:16,492 --> 00:28:18,994
(sighs)
This week.

645
00:28:19,062 --> 00:28:21,229
Honestly, I'm terrified.

646
00:28:21,297 --> 00:28:22,631
Don't sweat it, dude.

647
00:28:22,699 --> 00:28:23,999
You'll heal up good as new.

648
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:26,568
Yeah, and there are tons
of legendary performers

649
00:28:26,636 --> 00:28:29,504
who've only had one eye:
Sammy Davis, Jr., Columbo.

650
00:28:29,572 --> 00:28:32,174
And Stevie Wonder, he did
pretty good with no eyes at all.

651
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:34,643
You guys, I'm really upset
that I'm missing Michael Week.

652
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:37,012
It just totally sucks.

653
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,879
Well, that's why

654
00:28:37,947 --> 00:28:39,181
we figured we'd bring

655
00:28:39,248 --> 00:28:40,983
a little bit of Michael to you.
Yup.

656
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,184
Okay.

657

SANTANA:
Hey, Andrew McCarthy.

690
00:30:50,246 --> 00:30:52,848
Don't know if you heard,
but Blaine may lose an eye.

691
00:30:52,915 --> 00:30:55,050
The same Blaine who was just
besties with most of you

692
00:30:55,118 --> 00:30:56,918
not four months ago.

693

Wait, are you serious?

694
00:30:58,321 --> 00:30:59,421
Is he gonna be okay?

695
00:30:59,489 --> 00:31:00,989
Well, sure, if he doesn't care

696
00:31:01,057 --> 00:31:01,857
about seeing in three dimensions.

697
00:31:01,924 --> 00:31:03,125
Trent, I got this.

698
00:31:03,192 --> 00:31:05,127
Bummer about Blaine, he was pretty.

699
00:31:05,194 --> 00:31:06,128
He shouldn't have gotten
in the way, though.

700
00:31:06,195 --> 00:31:07,829
That slushee was meant for Kurt.

701
00:31:07,897 --> 00:31:10,899

703

but you should know that
I am fully prepared

704
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,904
to go all Danny LaRusso on your ass.

705
00:31:15,972 --> 00:31:17,706
Admit you put something
in that slushee.

706
00:31:17,774 --> 00:31:19,407
What was it, huh?

707
00:31:19,475 --> 00:31:20,709

right where we want them.

790
00:34:10,292 --> 00:34:12,543
And because he's the smoothest
criminal I know,

791
00:34:12,611 --> 00:34:14,295
Artie was able to find a spy store

792
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:16,163
that sells top-secret
surveillance equipment.

793
00:34:16,248 --> 00:34:17,615
Not top-secret.

794
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:19,283
I just got a tape recorder
from OfficeMax.

795
00:34:19,334 --> 00:34:20,418
Okay, okay, whatever.

796
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:22,420
In any case, I taped it
to my underboob

797
00:34:22,471 --> 00:34:24,455
when we went to Dalton, and I got

798
00:34:24,506 --> 00:34:26,123
Sebastian on tape admitting
that there was rock-salt

799
00:34:26,174 --> 00:34:27,475
in that slushee that blinded Blaine.

800
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:30,177
Now, all we have to do is send
this tape to the po-po,

801
00:34:30,262 --> 00:34:31,962
and that little bitchlet
is headed to juvie.

802
00:34:32,014 --> 00:34:33,631
SANTANA:
Admit it. Tell me the truth.

803
00:34:33,682 --> 00:34:35,399
What did you put in that slushee?

804
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:36,601
SEBASTIAN:
Rock salt.

805
00:34:36,652 --> 00:34:38,402
No. No, we're not doing that.

806
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,354
Why? Kurt, this isn't violent.
This is clever.

807
00:34:40,439 --> 00:34:42,106
I taped it to my underboob.

808
00:34:42,157 --> 00:34:43,691
So he gets kicked out of school.

809
00:34:43,775 --> 00:34:46,444
The Warblers still do Michael,
and they still beat us.

810
00:34:46,495 --> 00:34:49,163
Look, I want to see Sebastian's
head turning on a spit,

811
00:34:49,248 --> 00:34:51,582
but I've realized that you
can't go looking for payback

812
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,000
every time the world wrongs you.

813
00:34:53,085 --> 00:34:54,652
If Michael went after all the haters,

814
00:34:54,703 --> 00:34:56,320
he would have never had any time

815
00:34:56,371 --> 00:34:57,455
to do all that amazing music.

816
00:34:57,506 --> 00:34:59,173
So, we're not gonna
punish the Warblers.

817
00:34:59,258 --> 00:35:01,175
We're gonna teach them a lesson,

818
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,844
and I think I know how.

819
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:07,014
I've reserved the auditorium,
so if you all just follow me.

820
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:07,965
SANTANA:
Oh, wait.

821
00:35:08,016 --> 00:35:09,517
If Kurt would have taped this

822
00:35:09,601 --> 00:35:11,185
to his junk, I would have
never heard the end of it.

823
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,386
We would have had
a whole week of songs

824
00:35:12,471 --> 00:35:13,837
about it.

825
00:35:13,889 --> 00:35:15,640
Rachel, can I borrow you for a second?

826
00:35:15,691 --> 00:35:17,558
Yeah.

827
00:35:19,194 --> 00:35:21,395
So, are we gonna
practice or something?

828
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,781
Look, I know that
you're waiting for an answer,

829
00:35:23,848 --> 00:35:25,650
and-and trust me,
you deserve it...

830
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:27,868
No, no, I get it.
It's a big decision.

831
00:35:27,953 --> 00:35:31,238
It's just, the way I asked
you, I kind of left out

832
00:35:31,323 --> 00:35:32,790
the most important part.

833
00:35:32,857 --> 00:35:35,192
About how much rent we would
save if we went twosies?

834
00:35:37,412 --> 00:35:39,246
Just listen, okay?

835
00:35:39,331 --> 00:35:42,333
I always feel like you hear me
better when I'm not talking.

(song ends, applause)

962
00:41:56,173 --> 00:41:57,506
Very moving.

963
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:59,175
Come on, Sebastian.
Give it up.

964
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:00,559
That is the kind of attitude

965
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:01,894
that lost us Regionals last year.

966
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:04,096
I could call the cops
or your headmaster

967
00:42:04,181 --> 00:42:06,816
and get you kicked out
of school or even arrested

968
00:42:06,883 --> 00:42:08,851
for assaulting Blaine
with that slushee.

969
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:11,520
All of this would be
just awfully terrifying

970
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:14,156
if you had any proof whatsoever.

971
00:42:14,224 --> 00:42:16,909
You mean like you on tape
admitting to it?

972
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:19,445
(gasps)

973
00:42:19,529 --> 00:42:20,996
But you know what?

974
00:42:21,064 --> 00:42:23,082
It just wouldn't be
as much fun winning Regionals

975
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:26,235
if you weren't there to suffer
through all the agony of defeat.

976
00:42:26,286 --> 00:42:28,504
SANTANA: At least now, all
your teammates get to know

977
00:42:28,571 --> 00:42:29,789
exactly what kind of guy you are.

978
00:42:31,792 --> 00:42:32,758
ARTIE:
Now get the hell

979
00:42:32,843 --> 00:42:34,009
out of my auditorium.

980
00:42:36,096 --> 00:42:37,763
School's out!

981
00:42:37,848 --> 00:42:39,748
(school bell ringing)

982
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,684
(crowd chatter)

983
00:42:50,143 --> 00:42:53,195
Is... Is-Is that the...?

984
00:42:53,263 --> 00:42:56,399
My NYADA letter finally
came in the mail, and, uh...

985
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,317
and I'm a finalist.

986
00:42:59,602 --> 00:43:01,070
I'm a finalist!

987
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:02,455
I'm a finalist!
(laughing)

988
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:03,739
I'm so happy.
Oh, congrats.

989
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,107
Thank you.

990
00:43:05,158 --> 00:43:06,876
Oh, have you told Finn yet?

991
00:43:06,943 --> 00:43:17,777
