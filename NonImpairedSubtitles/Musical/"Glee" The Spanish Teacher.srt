00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:40,848
William...

20
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:42,267
What do you mean,
you received complaints?

21
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,435
Who complained?
I can't tell you that.

22
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,171
But I can tell you that
your teaching skills

23
00:00:47,222 --> 00:00:49,557
have been seriously
brought into question.

24
00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:51,726
Look, I-I know I'm not
a native Spanish speaker.

25
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,811
Sometimes I get a little
tripped up with the...
William.

26
00:00:53,862 --> 00:00:55,813
Will you please remove
that enormous sombrero

27
00:00:55,864 --> 00:00:57,615
so I can break
it down for you.

28
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,817
As you may have heard,

29
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:01,319
our history teacher,
Mrs. Hagberg,

30
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,488
has been forced into retirement

31
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,239
due to some memory problems.

32
00:01:05,324 --> 00:01:09,661
And that's how Germany
won the Second World War.

33
00:01:09,712 --> 00:01:11,996
Hagberg was a tenured
teacher at this school

34
00:01:12,047 --> 00:01:13,548
for over 40 years.

35
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:17,168
Her departure means there's
an open tenured position

36
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,336
here at McKinley.

37
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:20,505
Oh, Principal Figgins...

38
00:01:20,556 --> 00:01:21,973
Emma and I just got engaged.

39
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,258
We'll be starting a family soon.
I need that tenure.

40
00:01:24,343 --> 00:01:26,561
And I would love
to give it to you, William.

41
00:01:26,645 --> 00:01:28,596
But you're only one
of several teachers

42
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:30,815
I'm considering
for this position.

43
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,318
And to be frank, you have
a public relations problem.

44
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,069
If you want the tenure,

45
00:01:35,154 --> 00:01:36,387
you've got to turn it
around in the class.

46
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:38,222
O-Okay.
How do I do that?

47
00:01:38,273 --> 00:01:39,490
You're a Spanish teacher.

48
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,275
Maybe you should try
learning Spanish.

49
00:01:45,597 --> 00:01:46,564
(school bell ringing)

50
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:47,832
Señor Martinez?

51
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,235
You can call me David.

52
00:01:51,286 --> 00:01:52,587
David, I am thrilled

53
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:54,905
that Spanish has so many
different ways to say

54
00:01:54,957 --> 00:01:58,075
"to be," but right now
what I need to do

55
00:01:58,127 --> 00:02:00,178
is to learn how to say,

56
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,047
"Stop using my toilet,"
to my maid.

57
00:02:03,098 --> 00:02:05,967
I was hoping you could tell me
what the word "gordita" means.

58
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:08,419
I know we're all here
for different reasons.

59
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,087
Most of you need your GEDs,

60
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,023
some of you want to
go to Cabo San Lucas

61
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,608
and order like a local.

62
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:16,694
But did you know that the U.S.
census believe that by 2030

63
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:19,030
the majority of Americans
will use Spanish

64
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,598
as their first language?

65
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:22,533
You're not here
learning a language.

66
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,703
You're here 'cause you're smart.
And you're forward thinkers.

67
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,121
I'm sorry. I'm trying to listen,

68
00:02:27,206 --> 00:02:28,373
but you got some
beautiful teeth.

69
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,273
(chuckles)

70
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,168
<i>Asi que repiten conmigo.</i>

71
00:02:40,252 --> 00:02:41,085
Come on, repeat with me.

72
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,680
(school bell rings)

73
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:54,148
DAVID:
Very good. Thank you so much.

74
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:56,100
Remember, roll those "R"s.
(rolling "R"s)

75
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:57,968
(rolling "R"s)
Exactly.

76
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,070
Hey, I'm Will Schuester.

77
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,355
I teach Spanish here
during the day.

78
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,641
<i>Can I buy you a cup of café?</i>

79
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:04,975
(laughing):
Sure.

80
00:03:05,027 --> 00:03:06,611
There's something kind of
fun and rebellious

81
00:03:06,662 --> 00:03:07,745
about being here at night.

82
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,714
It's depressing.

83
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:11,649
No offense.
No. No, um...

84
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,818
Why don't you get a job
teaching regular high school?

85
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:15,720
Have you seen the news?
Budgets are being cut,

86
00:03:15,788 --> 00:03:17,355
there's a hiring freeze...

87
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:24,729
You know, could you maybe
say that a little slower?

88
00:03:24,797 --> 00:03:26,380
I think your accent's
throwing me off.

89
00:03:26,465 --> 00:03:27,765
W-Where you from?
Ohio.

90
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,667
But my parents are from Chile,

91
00:03:29,718 --> 00:03:31,469
and we only spoke Spanish
in the house, growing up.

92
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,937
Oh.

93
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,005
How-how long have you been,
uh, working here?

94
00:03:35,057 --> 00:03:36,858
Just a few months.
This is...

95
00:03:36,942 --> 00:03:38,976
actually the beginning
of my career change.

96
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:41,679
For the last six years,
I was a tooth model.

97
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,364
It's like a hand model,
but with your teeth.

98
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,684
Man, your teeth
are really white.

99
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:49,570
Yeah, no coffee,
no cigarettes, no beets.

100
00:03:49,655 --> 00:03:51,038
I was the top tooth model
in the country.

101
00:03:51,123 --> 00:03:53,574
Colgate, Crest Whitestrips,
Sensodyne...

102
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:54,826
Whenever they needed a smile
for their advertisement,

103
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:56,577
they would call on
Dave Martinez.

104
00:03:56,662 --> 00:03:58,496
Wow, that sounds like
a great gig.

105
00:03:58,547 --> 00:04:00,364
What... why'd you stop?

106
00:04:00,415 --> 00:04:01,716
Well, one day I...

107
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,368
I realized I was spending
so much time flossing, I...

108
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:06,704
I was missing my life.
I want to make a difference

109
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:08,089
that lasts longer
than a grin, you know?

110
00:04:08,173 --> 00:04:10,641
I-I want to teach kids.

111
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,344
I want to give them
something useful.

112
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:15,813
Something they can...
they can take with them

113
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,214
their whole lives.

114
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:18,683
<i>I want to help them
find their duende.</i>

115
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,984
<i>You know duende, right?</i>

116
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,051
Of course.

117
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:22,753
<i>Duende, yeah.</i>

118
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:24,655
Now, you also teach
Glee Club, right?

119
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,908
I do.
You see, that's...
that's inspiring.

120
00:04:26,992 --> 00:04:29,861
I actually wanted to try forming
the night school Glee Club,

121
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:32,029
but meeting after school
means 2:00 in the morning.

122
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,998
Ah, right.
(laughs)
I love to sing.

123
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,735
<i>I actually learned English
watching reruns of Solid Gold.</i>

124
00:04:37,786 --> 00:04:38,870
Wait. You're serious?

125
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:40,505
Yeah. They-they've done
studies on it.

126
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,207
The brain takes in information,
like a new language,

127
00:04:43,258 --> 00:04:45,843
or a math equation,
much more quickly

128
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,745
and retains it better,
when that information

129
00:04:47,813 --> 00:04:49,347
is delivered through music.

130
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,583
<i>Well, there's a lot of
duende involved, too.</i>

131
00:04:54,052 --> 00:04:55,753
You know what I would do
if I was teaching Glee Club?

132
00:04:55,804 --> 00:04:57,638
Latin music. Think about it.

133
00:04:57,723 --> 00:04:59,390
You get those kids
singing in Spanish,

134
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,625
and they'll be
learning the language

135
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:02,627
without even realizing it.

136
00:05:02,694 --> 00:05:05,246
<i>WILL:
If I could have some of my
Glee kids speaking Spanish</i>

137
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:07,932
<i>by the end of the week, it'd be
a hell of an accomplishment.</i>

138
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,184
<i>That's Teacher of the Year
stuff.</i>

139
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:12,470
Twice a day, you boys stain

140
00:05:12,538 --> 00:05:15,156
your mother's drapes,
or befoul a gym sock

141
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,158
that has to jump from the hamper
straight into therapy.

142
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:18,993
SUE:
Why not head on down
to the clinic,

143
00:05:19,077 --> 00:05:21,495
and put your virile
teen years to good use?

144
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,381
You'll have five bucks more
than when you walked in,

145
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,250
and the gratitude of
lonely ovaries everywhere.

146
00:05:26,301 --> 00:05:28,219
But not you. You can
keep tossing your tissues

147
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,304
into the trash.
I was in an accident.

148
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,740
Still. Same goes for you,
Porcelain.

149
00:05:32,808 --> 00:05:34,792
Let the strangeness
end with you.

150
00:05:34,843 --> 00:05:37,011
What's going on, Sue?

151
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:40,014
Well, William, I'm just
trying to instill

152
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:41,799
the spirit of giving
in your students.

153
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,435
No, honestly, I, uh...

154
00:05:44,486 --> 00:05:47,605
was a little bit dismayed
by the quality of men

155
00:05:47,656 --> 00:05:49,740
holding Dixie cups
down at the sperm bank

156
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,125
this morning.

157
00:05:51,193 --> 00:05:52,526
Zero viable options.

158
00:05:52,611 --> 00:05:54,996
<i>Looked like the cast from
Ice Road Truckers.</i>

159
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,915
So I thought it'd be best
if I found a sperm donor here.

160
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,200
H-Hold on a second.

161
00:05:59,284 --> 00:06:00,251
You're serious?

162
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,953
Yes, William.

163
00:06:02,004 --> 00:06:04,005
I have decided to have a child.

164
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:05,673
(laughs)

165
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,542
Um, wow.

166
00:06:08,627 --> 00:06:10,761
I guess I just never saw you
as the mothering type.

167
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,513
Well, I resent that, William.

168
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:14,615
I have a very strong
mothering instinct.

169
00:06:14,683 --> 00:06:16,350
I had it with my sister.

170
00:06:16,435 --> 00:06:17,885
I have it with Becky Jackson.

171
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,222
I like to think I play
a parenting role in her life.

172
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:25,059
And like so many women who
chose career over family,

173
00:06:25,143 --> 00:06:27,878
I've decided to take my life
in a different direction

174
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:30,848
while there's still time.

175
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,149
Are you sure
that's even possible?

176
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,402
Yes, William, I am sure.

177
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:38,072
You see, I had my eggs
frozen in the late '70s.

178
00:06:38,156 --> 00:06:40,741
They didn't even have that
technology in the late '70s.

179
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:43,327
I know.
I did it myself.

180
00:06:43,378 --> 00:06:46,497
Oh...
The good people at Kroger
have been keeping a box

181
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:48,332
of my championship ova

182
00:06:48,383 --> 00:06:49,834
cooling in their meat locker.

183
00:06:49,885 --> 00:06:51,252
And what with
the financial security

184
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:53,721
that will be afforded me
by the end of the week...

185
00:06:53,805 --> 00:06:56,040
I am finally ready

186
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:58,426
to start a family.

187
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,061
Now, I don't know if
you've heard, William,

188
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:01,228
but there's a tenured position

189
00:07:01,313 --> 00:07:02,980
opening up at our school.

190
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,349
And I'm a shoe-in.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

191
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,052
What makes you so sure you're
the one who's gonna get tenure?

192
00:07:08,103 --> 00:07:09,553
Seniority, William.

193
00:07:09,604 --> 00:07:11,939
I'm first in line, and also,
I'm a proven champion.

194
00:07:12,024 --> 00:07:15,910
And now seeing as how I find
bald infants terrifying,

195
00:07:15,994 --> 00:07:17,995
I'm going to need a few
ounces of your baby gravy

196
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,865
to ensure Sue Sylvester Jr. is
born with a full head of hair.

197
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,616
Coach?

198
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:26,170
Principal Figgins wants to
see you in his office.

199
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:29,040
Looks like I got my tenure.

200
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:31,509
Cheerleading magazines
are right here.

201
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,410
Have fun.

202
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,717
Complaints?

203
00:07:39,768 --> 00:07:42,219
Who's complaining about
my teaching style?

204
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,355
I can't tell you that, Sue.

205
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,223
A student who shall
remain anonymous.

206
00:07:46,274 --> 00:07:47,274
Well, then, who's this?

207
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:50,778
Sue, this is the talented
and enchanting

208
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:52,947
Olympian Roz Washington.

209
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:54,165
Coach of the McKinley

210
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:56,200
synchronized swimming team.

211
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,486
Roz approached me with
some constructive criticism

212
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,071
about your lagging Cheerios!

213
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:01,539
Why should I listen
to this woman

214
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,773
give me notes

215
00:08:02,824 --> 00:08:04,158
about my Cheerios?

216
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:06,410
Because Cheerios! didn't
win Nationals last year, Sue.

217
00:08:06,461 --> 00:08:09,613
And remember, you're on my short
list for the tenured position.

218
00:08:09,664 --> 00:08:11,549
And tenured teachers
are team players.

219
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,135
Well, let me tell you
why ticket sales are down

220
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:16,504
at sporting events.
This school got cheerleaders

221
00:08:16,588 --> 00:08:18,973
doing broke-ass moves
from the 1950s.

222
00:08:19,057 --> 00:08:20,891
Hm.
Why don't you just admit

223
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,460
that you're past your
competitive edge, Sue Sylvester,

224
00:08:23,512 --> 00:08:24,562
and let this young

225
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,482
bronze-medal winner
add some crunk

226
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:30,401
to the ba-dunk-a-dunk?

227
00:08:32,687 --> 00:08:34,655
(school bell ringing)

228
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,656
WILL:
All right, guys!

229
00:08:35,741 --> 00:08:37,108
Let me ask you something.

230
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,244
Where do you think you'll
be in the year 2030?

231
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,996
RACHEL & KURT:
Broadway. Twinsies!

232
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,614
Walking.

233
00:08:43,665 --> 00:08:44,999
In jail, or dead. Or both.

234
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,500
WILL:
Wherever you are,

235
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:48,786
whatever you're doing, you're
going to need to be able

236
00:08:48,837 --> 00:08:51,288
to speak Spanish.
The reality is, by 2030,

237
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:52,673
more people on this planet

238
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:55,059
will be speaking Spanish
than any other language.

239
00:08:55,127 --> 00:08:57,094
The world is changing.
Our culture is changing.

240
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,963
And that needs to be
reflected in here.

241
00:08:59,014 --> 00:09:00,664
So for our next assignment,
we're only doing songs

242
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:04,501
written or performed by someone
Latin, or of Latin descent.

243
00:09:04,553 --> 00:09:06,353
Or English songs
performed bilingually.

244
00:09:06,438 --> 00:09:07,938
Ooh, I'm bilingual.

245
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,340
, Mr. Shue, though I love
that we're finally getting

246
00:09:10,392 --> 00:09:13,227
all Lima Sound Machine
in here, why now?

247
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:15,279
Oh, Santana,
because it's long overdue.

248
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,065
The truth is,
I love all things Latin.

249
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:20,484
I mean, I love Latin food,

250
00:09:20,535 --> 00:09:21,902
Latin art, Latin people...

251
00:09:21,987 --> 00:09:23,988
You don't know any Latin people.
(knocking)

252
00:09:30,212 --> 00:09:32,129
I know. Um...
Guys, this is David Martinez.

253
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,197
David Martinez,
this is the Glee Club.

254
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:34,248
RACHEL:
Oh, my God.

255
00:09:34,332 --> 00:09:35,699
Cutest...
...smile...

256
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,201
...ever.

257
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:39,587
Hello, everyone.

258
00:09:39,671 --> 00:09:40,671
It's a pleasure.

259
00:09:40,722 --> 00:09:42,089
WILL:
David here is one of my

260
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:44,374
many Latin friends.

261
00:09:44,426 --> 00:09:46,710
And, uh, he's interested
in starting his own

262
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:48,813
night school Glee Club,
after hours.

263
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,516
<i>So, uh, I invited him to come
watch us get our duende on.</i>

264
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:53,717
<i>Duende?</i>

265
00:09:53,768 --> 00:09:56,153
Ugh, it means "dwarf," you ass.

266
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,988
Now I'm completely confused.
So what's the assignment?

267
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,391
<i>To sing, in Spanish,
with duende.</i>

268
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:03,393
Which, yes,
literally means "dwarf,"

269
00:10:03,445 --> 00:10:04,895
but metaphorically, it means

270
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:07,248
to have Spanish soul.

271
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:10,117
To be filled with
Spanish passion.

272
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:11,502
Will, can I...

273
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,787
<i>ÿhablar con ellos?
That's... right.</i>

274
00:10:13,872 --> 00:10:17,124
<i>A performance with duende
transforms you.</i>

275
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:21,011
Makes you sing, makes you cry,
makes you laugh.

276
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,796
Makes you want to
kiss a person you love.

277
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:25,516
<i>A song sung in Spanish
must have duende,</i>

278
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,184
or else...

279
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,303
Would you mind showing us?
Oh dear God, please, yes.

280
00:10:30,472 --> 00:10:32,056
Be my guest.

281
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:34,892
Okay. Well, I'm-I'm not a
professional like you guys,

282
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:36,610
but I'll give it a go.
All right.

283
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:38,028
Now, guys, uh...

284
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,397
remember, Mr. Martinez
is here as our guest, okay?

285
00:10:40,448 --> 00:10:42,950
Let's create a safe and

+

357
00:13:23,995 --> 00:13:26,663
- Here is the problem: Sam and I used to date.
- Then I moved away, and now

358
00:13:26,748 --> 00:13:28,549
I'm bunking at Finn and Kurt's.
And I started dating

359
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:30,033
another guy who I really like.

360
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,952
But then she and I kissed.

361
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:33,487
And I feel really weird
about it.

362
00:13:33,555 --> 00:13:34,955
Just trying to
figure out a way

363
00:13:35,006 --> 00:13:36,940
to work this out without
anyone's feelings getting hurt.

364
00:13:37,008 --> 00:13:38,291
Actually, you're in luck

365
00:13:38,343 --> 00:13:40,561
because I just got
my new series of pamphlets

366
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:42,346
back from the printer,
which uniquely address

367
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,398
the modern-day issues
of today's 21st century teen.

368
00:13:44,465 --> 00:13:46,767
Yes. Okay.

369
00:13:46,818 --> 00:13:48,519
Mm-hmm.

370
00:13:50,488 --> 00:13:51,822
"So You're a Two-Timin' Ho"?

371
00:13:51,906 --> 00:13:53,107
"So You're Dating
a Two-Timin' Ho."

372
00:13:53,174 --> 00:13:54,775
Right? They get
your attention, don't they?

373
00:13:54,826 --> 00:13:57,327
I mean, that... that really
makes you want to read on.

374
00:13:57,412 --> 00:13:58,912
Miss Pillsbury,
I don't sleep around.

375
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,397
That's not me.

376
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,533
Okay.
I'm just trying to
listen to my heart,

377
00:14:02,617 --> 00:14:05,502
and it's like I can't hear
what it's trying to tell me.

378
00:14:05,587 --> 00:14:07,371
Well, if you really want
to listen,

379
00:14:07,455 --> 00:14:09,089
then you need to stop talking.

380
00:14:09,157 --> 00:14:10,824
I'm serious.

381
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,659
You know, there's a lot
of communication

382
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,961
in your lives these days.

383
00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:15,712
With texting and IM'ing
and Facebooking,

384
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:17,381
I mean, you don't have
any quiet time

385
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:19,433
with yourselves
to make informed decisions

386
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,385
on... on your true feelings.

387
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:22,519
(cell phone chiming)

388
00:14:22,604 --> 00:14:23,687
For instance.

389
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:24,888
(chirping)

390
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:26,673
Sam just tweeted
that I smell good.

391
00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:28,425
I won't stop
till it's trending.

392
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,927
This is my point.

393
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,012
I think that you and Sam
should spend a week

394
00:14:32,063 --> 00:14:33,346
not speaking to each other.

395
00:14:33,398 --> 00:14:35,115
No e-mails, no texts, nothing.

396
00:14:35,183 --> 00:14:36,950
And I think,
at the end of that week,

397
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:38,452
you'll have
a much better idea of what

398
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,653
your true feelings are.

399
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:41,021
Shh, shh. No. No.

400
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:43,657
Starting... starting...

401
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,242
now.
(school bell ringing)

402
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,694
Hooray.

403
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:49,362
Not speaking.

booties need to cool off.

418
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:33,540
Now, I ain't no mind reader,
Sue Sylvester,

419
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:36,960
and I came from
a very superstitious household

420
00:15:37,045 --> 00:15:39,463
where such things
are not allowed,

421
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:42,382
but I got a feeling
that those Cheerios!

422
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:45,686
like my modern dance moves
a little bit better

423
00:15:45,753 --> 00:15:47,420
than them old stale
white-bread routines

424
00:15:47,472 --> 00:15:48,889
you've been making them do.

425
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:51,024
You know, Roz,

426
00:15:51,092 --> 00:15:53,927
the English language
lacks the requisite words

427
00:15:53,978 --> 00:15:57,364
to express just how much
I dislike you.

428
00:15:57,431 --> 00:15:58,765
And I'm onto you.

429
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:00,400
<i>Yeah, I've seen All About Eve.</i>

430
00:16:00,451 --> 00:16:02,169
I know what you're planning.

431
00:16:02,237 --> 00:16:04,655
You're waiting for me to
take maternity leave,

432
00:16:04,739 --> 00:16:07,491
and then you're going to swoop
in and try to steal my job.

433
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:09,543
Hold up. Hold up.
Hold up. Wait.

434
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,961
Oh, my God. Hold up.

435
00:16:11,045 --> 00:16:12,629
Maternity leave?

436
00:16:12,714 --> 00:16:14,281
Are you pulling my leg?

437
00:16:14,332 --> 00:16:15,749
No, I am not.

438
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,136
I am getting pregnant,
and then I am having a baby.

439
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,470
With whose vagina?

440
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:22,756
Sue, you can't
have no baby.

441
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:24,474
You are old as a hill.

442
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,793
You ain't gonna
give birth to no child.

443
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:28,729
You gonna give birth
to a grandchild.

444
00:16:28,796 --> 00:16:30,647
You gonna get in them stirrups,

445
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:33,267
and you gonna push and push,

446
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:35,068
and a full-grown adult
gonna pop out

447
00:16:35,136 --> 00:16:37,637
with a briefcase and a job
talking on a cell phone.

448
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:38,905
And by the way,
I don't need

449
00:16:38,973 --> 00:16:42,442
to steal your job,
Sue Sylvester.

450
00:16:42,493 --> 00:16:43,660
You know why?

451
00:16:43,745 --> 00:16:46,113
Principal Figgins
is gonna give it to me.

452
00:16:46,164 --> 00:16:47,698
He wouldn't.

453
00:16:47,782 --> 00:16:50,334
Oh, he would.

454
00:16:50,418 --> 00:16:52,286
You see,
a long time ago,

455
00:16:52,337 --> 00:16:54,154
you won some trophies.

456
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:56,123
And that was
real impressive.

457
00:16:56,174 --> 00:16:59,126
I, however, am an Olympian.

458
00:16:59,177 --> 00:17:01,895
I won this bronze
damn Olympic medal

459
00:17:01,963 --> 00:17:03,547
in Beijing, China.

460
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:05,098
I had noodles with the president

461
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,833
and a threesome
with Michael Phelps.

462
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:08,185
What you need to do

463
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:10,187
is wake up
and smell the menopause.

464
00:17:10,271 --> 00:17:11,805
You are...

467
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,811
can't change the fact
that you are done as a woman.

468
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:20,063
What you need to do
is start praying

469
00:17:20,148 --> 00:17:21,748
that you give birth
to a child

470
00:17:21,816 --> 00:17:23,516
that likes to eat sand,

471
00:17:23,568 --> 00:17:26,370

out those old, wrinkly boobs.

472
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,875
I can do this.

473
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:34,044

supposed to choose

476
00:17:45,923 --> 00:17:49,059
between the juiced-up wolf
and the depressed vampire?

477

She's into both of them.

Oh, come on, Mercedes.
She just knows.

But what if they both
make her feel amazing

in different ways?

481

Well, you don't
get to choose

to true love.

And you better be certain
when it comes to marriage

485
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:01,938

is promise,

497
00:18:28,182 --> 00:18:30,133
And what did you say?
I said yes.

00:18:30,218 --> 00:18:31,468
Rachel, have you lost

there he is.

Finn.

Look, I know that I
am going to be with Finn

511
00:18:54,242 --> 00:18:56,126
for the rest of my life,
just as much as I know

512
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,794
that I am going to be
a huge star one day.

513
00:18:59,714 --> 00:19:01,415
So you promise
not to tell anyone?

514

Okay, I'm going home right now

because this is insane.

That is not fair, Kurt.
I mean, what would

517

you do if Blaine proposed
to you today?

to start a family.

00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:12,263
Well, In case you haven't
noticed, Deena,

611
00:24:12,314 --> 00:24:13,848
I have a little bit
of a mean streak.

612
00:24:13,932 --> 00:24:17,235
I'm cunning, I'm vindictive,
I spend a large portion

613
00:24:17,302 --> 00:24:20,154
of every day vibrating
with a palpable sense

614
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:22,073
of wild, irrational rage.

615
00:24:24,026 --> 00:24:28,246
And I don't ever want my kid
to feel that.

616
00:24:28,313 --> 00:24:31,616
And every time I've
insulted Will

617
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:33,501
or tried to stop him
in his crusade

618
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:36,287
to ruin pop culture
by wiping his woolly behind

619

with the American songbook,

620
00:24:38,457 --> 00:24:44,328
he's always risen up
and met me with kindness.

621
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:48,099
If goodness
and optimism are
somehow genetic,

622
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:51,102
that's what I want
for my child.

623
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:59,610
He isn't gonna do it, is he?

624
00:24:59,678 --> 00:25:01,329
I prefer to let him
tell you that.

a child.

of my own bedroom.

635
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:39,717
Hmm.

636
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,389
Why don't you pick up these?

637
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,241
They're from
Mrs. Pillsbury.

638
00:25:47,326 --> 00:25:48,576
College brochures.
What do you got?

639
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,894
Fordham, NYU, Adelphi.

640
00:25:50,946 --> 00:25:52,330
That one's in Long Island.

641
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:54,165
Yeah, there's a train
station right next to the campus

642
00:25:54,232 --> 00:25:55,232
right into Manhattan.

643
00:25:55,283 --> 00:25:57,752
I think they have
a football team.

644
00:25:57,836 --> 00:25:59,870
I think they all have musical
theater programs, too.

645
00:25:59,921 --> 00:26:01,205
That's sweet, dude,
but you know,

646
00:26:01,256 --> 00:26:02,289
college isn't for everyone.

647
00:26:02,374 --> 00:26:03,457
Neither is marriage.

648
00:26:04,976 --> 00:26:06,794
I can't believe she told you.

649
00:26:06,878 --> 00:26:09,463
I can't believe you didn't.
We're supposed to be brothers.

650
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:11,015
Look, I didn't want
to put you in

651
00:26:11,082 --> 00:26:12,083
an awkward position
with Burt, okay?

652
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,467
I don't want him to know yet.

653
00:26:13,552 --> 00:26:14,635
Hey, you think something

654
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,253
you have to keep
from everyone you love

655
00:26:16,304 --> 00:26:18,356
might not be the best idea in
the first place?

656
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:20,274
Don't get down on me
about this, dude.

657
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:22,193
Rachel's, like, the only good
thing I've got going

658
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,361
in my life right now.

659
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:25,229
No, she isn't, Finn.

660
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,815
Look, I get you've had a rough
year with finding out

661
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:30,117
who your dad really is and-and
losing the scholarship,

662
00:26:30,202 --> 00:26:33,821
but you're a star, Finn,
just as bright as Rachel.

663
00:26:33,905 --> 00:26:35,439
You just don't
believe in yourself.

664
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,158
Yeah, well, the proof's in
the pudding, okay?

665
00:26:37,242 --> 00:26:39,577
And my pudding
pretty much sucks.

666
00:26:39,628 --> 00:26:42,413
Look, I'm not telling you that
you shouldn't marry Rachel.

667
00:26:42,464 --> 00:26:44,165
I love her despite
all of her crazy,

668
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:47,301
and I think that you'd be
lucky to marry her... one day.

669
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:49,136
But I don't want you just to
turn yourself into nothing

670
00:26:49,221 --> 00:26:51,088
but the guy who holds her purse
on the red carpet.

671
00:26:51,139 --> 00:26:52,506
Look, I'm getting to the
point in my life where

672
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:54,592
I kind of need to be honest with
myself about who I am.

673
00:26:54,643 --> 00:26:55,943
And who is that?

674
00:26:56,011 --> 00:26:57,962
Not you.

675
00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:00,564
Not Rachel.

676
00:27:00,632 --> 00:27:02,850
That's the point, Finn.

677
00:27:02,934 --> 00:27:05,569
There are plenty
of us, trust me.

678
00:27:05,637 --> 00:27:09,240
The one thing that Glee Clubs
and theater programs don't have

679
00:27:09,307 --> 00:27:12,142
is the hot, straight football
player who can sing

680
00:27:12,194 --> 00:27:15,145
and sort of dance.
You're unique, Finn.

681
00:27:15,197 --> 00:27:18,148
And I can't see this proposal
thing as anything else

682
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,150
but you giving up
on yourself.

683
00:27:20,202 --> 00:27:22,620
No, no, it's not.

684
00:27:25,207 --> 00:27:27,157
At least I don't...
I don't think it is.

685
00:27:27,209 --> 00:27:30,928
Your time isn't up, Finn.

686
00:27:30,996 --> 00:27:32,663
It's just beginning.

687
00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:38,001
Hey, Kurt.

688
00:27:40,338 --> 00:27:42,523
Thanks.

689
00:27:45,076 --> 00:27:47,478
(bell ringing)

690
00:27:49,515 --> 00:27:49,515
+

691
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,586
Hold it right there,
Sandbacks.

692
00:27:55,756 --> 00:27:57,706
You and I need to
have a serious chat.

693
00:27:57,758 --> 00:27:59,541
Now I realize
when I chose Becky

694
00:27:59,593 --> 00:28:00,760
as co-captain for
the Cheerios!

695
00:28:00,844 --> 00:28:02,377
it might have rubbed
you the wrong way.

696
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:03,712
Wanky.

697
00:28:03,764 --> 00:28:05,481
And I've often admired
the craven heartlessness

698
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:08,067
of your pointless,
vindictive back-stabbing.

699
00:28:08,151 --> 00:28:10,236
Kind of takes me back
to the old salad days.

700
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,354
But you crossed the Maginot Line

701
00:28:12,405 --> 00:28:14,323
when you started messing with
Sue Sylvester's family.

702
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,408
What are you talking about?
What family?

703
00:28:16,493 --> 00:28:18,694
You lodged a complaint
about my teaching tactics

704
00:28:18,745 --> 00:28:20,830
with Principal Figgins,
possibly derailing my bid

705
00:28:20,897 --> 00:28:23,783
for tenure just when I'm trying
to have a baby!

706
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:26,702
A baby? With whose vagina?

707
00:28:26,753 --> 00:28:28,403
Hey, what is going on here?

708
00:28:28,455 --> 00:28:30,873
Coach Sylvester is accusing me
of something I didn't do.

709
00:28:30,924 --> 00:28:33,292
Oh, stop with the lies, sweater
meat, or you will be hawking

710
00:28:33,376 --> 00:28:35,127
nude glossies of yourself behind
the Dumpster of Hooters

711
00:28:35,212 --> 00:28:36,462
by the weekend.

712
00:28:36,546 --> 00:28:37,596
I know you did this!

713
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:39,414
Sue, enough!

714
00:28:39,466 --> 00:28:42,935
No one messes with my family.
No one.

715
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:45,137
Oh, and you can rest your fetid,
woolly head, William.

716
00:28:45,222 --> 00:28:47,022
I don't need
your baby spunk anymore.

717
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,892
Got myself another donor.
And a much better one.

718
00:28:49,943 --> 00:28:51,393
Who?

719
00:28:58,935 --> 00:29:01,654
(bell ringing)

720
00:29:01,738 --> 00:29:03,706
(foops approach)

721
00:29:05,441 --> 00:29:07,743
I just got my new pamphlets
back from the printer.

722
00:29:07,794 --> 00:29:11,446
I am feeling so
Stephen King with
these things lately.

723
00:29:11,498 --> 00:29:13,465
You know, just
so prolific.

724
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,134
That's great, Em,
but I really need

725
00:29:15,218 --> 00:29:17,119
to translate this song
for my big number tomorrow.

726
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,505
It's my last chance to wow
the kids with my español.

727
00:29:19,589 --> 00:29:21,223
By the end of
the week, I need

728
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:22,842
every single one of those kids
begging Figgins

729
00:29:22,926 --> 00:29:25,127
to give me that tenure spot.

730
00:29:25,178 --> 00:29:27,346
<i>Conversación.
Of course.</i>

731
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,849
<i>"Conversation" in Spanish is
conversación.</i>

732
00:29:29,933 --> 00:29:31,650
(sighs)

733
00:29:35,856 --> 00:29:37,940
Do you realize how important
this tenure is for us,

734
00:29:37,991 --> 00:29:39,275
if we want to start a family?

735
00:29:39,326 --> 00:29:41,277
It means we will
always be able to feed our kids,

736
00:29:41,328 --> 00:29:43,495
get them health insurance.

737
00:29:46,199 --> 00:29:47,783
Emma, enough!

738
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:51,153
Can't you see I'm doing
this to take care of you?

739
00:29:52,822 --> 00:29:56,008
Okay, I think I can
take care of myself.

740
00:29:56,092 --> 00:29:58,260
You know what, I'm sorry.

741
00:29:58,328 --> 00:30:00,045
I just wanted to show
you my new pamphlets.

742
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,463
I'm really proud of them.

743
00:30:01,514 --> 00:30:04,600
They're silly, Emma.
I'm sorry, I love you,

744
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,685
but do you really think
the kids take them seriously?

745
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:09,805
Okay, you know what?
I know that the titles are
silly; that's the point.

746
00:30:09,856 --> 00:30:12,174
Sometimes you have to
be a little provocative

747
00:30:12,225 --> 00:30:14,193
if you want to get
teenagers' attention.

748
00:30:14,277 --> 00:30:16,028
<i>They're
conversación starters.</i>

749
00:30:16,112 --> 00:30:17,813
And you're being really mean.

750
00:30:17,864 --> 00:30:18,847
You got a pamphlet for that?

751
00:30:20,734 --> 00:30:22,568
Emma, I'm sorry.

752
00:30:22,652 --> 00:30:23,903
Emma, wait.

753
00:30:28,658 --> 00:30:30,859

David Martinez.

814
00:33:04,347 --> 00:33:05,680

your participation here.

815
00:33:10,036 --> 00:33:11,620
And, hey, wasn't
that number fantastic

816
00:33:11,687 --> 00:33:13,322

817
00:33:13,373 --> 00:33:15,207
(cheering, applause)

818
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:16,959
DAVID: Thank you
very much, everyone.

819
00:33:17,026 --> 00:33:19,128
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a stack of

Well, Mr. Shue,
the floor is all yours.

825
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:30,722
I'm excited.
Yay, Mr. Shue.

(cheering, applause)

860
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:11,342
(chuckles)

861
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:14,429
It was you.

862
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:16,414
You're the one who complained
to Principal Figgins about me.

863
00:35:16,465 --> 00:35:18,933
Yeah, and I'd do it all over
again after that performance.

864
00:35:19,018 --> 00:35:20,685
You're messing with
adult things here, Santana.

865
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:23,021
This is my job.
This is my life.

866
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:25,690
And this is my education,
and it's not a joke to me,

867
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:27,475
although it seems
to be one to you.

868
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,727
What are you talking about?
They all loved my performance.

869
00:35:29,778 --> 00:35:31,229
Because they don't know
any better.

870
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,230
It's your fault.

871
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:33,314
You're their teacher.

872
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:34,949
You went from
"La Cucaracha"

873
00:35:35,034 --> 00:35:36,317
to a bullfighting mariachi.

874
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:37,485
Why don't you just

875
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,104
dress up as
the Taco Bell Chihuahua

876
00:35:40,155 --> 00:35:42,206
<i>and bark the theme song
to Dora the Explorer?</i>

877
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:44,442
You don't even know enough
to be embarrassed

878
00:35:44,493 --> 00:35:46,911
about these stereotypes
that you're perpetuating.

879
00:35:46,962 --> 00:35:48,379
That's not fair.
Isn't it?

880
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:51,382
What did you want to be
when you grew up?

881
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,668
Why did you become
a Spanish teacher, Mr. Shue?

882
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:57,788
Because...

883
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:06,481
...it was the only teaching
position open at the time.

884
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,686
I want to remind you
of something that

885
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,005
an amazing teacher
once taught me:

886
00:36:14,073 --> 00:36:16,691
without passion,
you can't succeed.

887
00:36:18,694 --> 00:36:19,994
Who taught you that?

888
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,046
You did.

889
00:36:22,114 --> 00:36:23,514
And you do.

890
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:24,732
When you teach Glee.

891
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:31,873
I'm telling you,
there's no word but "genius."

892
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:33,658
I wouldn't
call it that.

893
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:35,293
What's genius?
My plan for Regionals?

894
00:36:35,344 --> 00:36:38,129
No. Your lil'
punkin's pamphlets.

895
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:40,632
"Taint Misbehavin'."

896
00:36:40,683 --> 00:36:41,633
Mm-hmm.

897
00:36:41,684 --> 00:36:42,934
It's all about the importance

898
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,552
of thoroughly washing
your jockstrap.

899
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:46,070
(chuckles)
Hey, bub,

900
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:48,272
MRSA bacteria infection
is no laughing matter.

901
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,474
No matter how
much I talked

902
00:36:49,525 --> 00:36:52,626
to my guys about
the steamy lurking dangers,

903
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:53,811
nobody cared

904
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:55,846
Until Emma found a way
to get through to them.

905
00:36:55,898 --> 00:36:57,848
Come on, guys!

906
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,018
Why, just last week,
three Fort Wayne gymnasts

907
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,454
had to have
their junk amputated!

908
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:06,074
I stopped washing down there
'cause it seemed kind of gay.

909
00:37:06,158 --> 00:37:08,826
I thought that's what the hair
was for: catching the dirt.

910
00:37:08,877 --> 00:37:10,578
Huh. Lift and scrub.

911
00:37:10,663 --> 00:37:12,213
Who knew it was so easy?

912
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:14,215
BEISTE:
And now their kibbles
and bits are

913
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,883
as clean as a little
angel's tear.

914
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:17,969
And when I showed that
to my Cooter,

915
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:21,872
not only did he order
10,000 copies for Ohio State,

916
00:37:21,924 --> 00:37:25,259
he got every team in the Big Ten
to order copies, too.

917
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:27,478
Wow, that's...
It's genius!

918
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:29,847
I have never met a
teacher whose passion

919
00:37:29,898 --> 00:37:31,683
literally saves lives.

920
00:37:31,734 --> 00:37:33,101
Aren't you proud of her, Will?

921
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:36,187
Yes.

922
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:37,071
Absolutely.

923
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:40,358
Genius! You!

924
00:37:40,409 --> 00:37:41,275
EMMA:
Stop.

925
00:37:42,252 --> 00:37:42,252
+

926
00:37:45,047 --> 00:37:47,232
And the award for
Best Conjugator goes to

927
00:37:47,317 --> 00:37:48,434
Señora Stephanie.

928
00:37:48,518 --> 00:37:49,601
(laughs)

929
00:37:50,887 --> 00:37:53,572
Thank you,
Señor Martinez.

930
00:37:53,656 --> 00:37:55,774
And thanks to you,
Claudia knows now

931
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:57,993
to go before she
comes to work.

932
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,561
(laughs)

933
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:02,063
Now finally, Most Improved:

934
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:04,583
Will Schuester.

935
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:06,084
Wow.
Come on, man!

936
00:38:06,169 --> 00:38:07,753
(chuckles)
Thanks.

937
00:38:07,837 --> 00:38:09,288
Wow, I...

938
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:10,622
(school bell ringing)
Oh.

939
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:11,740
<i>Fue un año
maravilloso.</i>

940
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,208
It was a beautiful
year, everyone.

941
00:38:13,259 --> 00:38:14,593
<i>Gracias.
Hey, de nada.</i>

942
00:38:14,677 --> 00:38:16,595
<i>Gracias.
(chuckles)</i>

943
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:18,914
Your teeth are like
fresh-driven snow white.

944
00:38:18,965 --> 00:38:20,516
Like Larry Bird white.

945
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:22,468
(Will and David laugh)

946
00:38:22,552 --> 00:38:24,186
Most Improved.

947
00:38:24,253 --> 00:38:27,055
I don't think that's the award
a Spanish teacher wants to get

948
00:38:27,106 --> 00:38:28,524
in Spanish class.

949
00:38:28,591 --> 00:38:31,560
Will, man, you work hard,
you take care of your kids.

950
00:38:31,611 --> 00:38:33,094
They're very lucky
to have you, man.

951
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:34,980
They deserve better.

952
00:38:35,064 --> 00:38:36,264
They deserve you.

953
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:38,667
Oh, so when do I
start? (laughs)

954
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:40,602
How about Monday?

955
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:42,037
I spoke to Figgins.

956
00:38:42,104 --> 00:38:44,373
I had all the kids go in
and talk to him, as well.

957
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,109
They all want to take Spanish
if you're the teacher.

958
00:38:47,177 --> 00:38:49,011
What, he's offering me a job?

959
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,347
Teaching?

960
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:53,749
During the day?

961
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,300
(chuckles):
I hope you're not a vampire.

962
00:38:56,886 --> 00:38:58,453
Oh, man.

963
00:38:58,505 --> 00:38:59,388
(laughs)

964
00:38:59,455 --> 00:39:01,390
Okay.

965
00:39:01,457 --> 00:39:03,926
Oh, man, you don...
you don't understand.

966
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:05,594
My-My parents,

967
00:39:05,645 --> 00:39:07,479
my parents were immigrants.

968
00:39:07,564 --> 00:39:10,315
And they had to lie
about their citizenship

969
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,300
to go to high school.

970
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:14,603
And now I'm teaching it.

971
00:39:14,654 --> 00:39:16,321
It's the American Dream, right?

972
00:39:16,406 --> 00:39:17,689
Yeah.
(chuckles)

973
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:19,491
But what about you?

974
00:39:19,576 --> 00:39:22,811
Oh, there's-there's an opening
in the History department.

975
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:24,329
I've always loved history.

976
00:39:24,397 --> 00:39:26,331
Well, the History Channel,
at least.

977
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:28,650
<i>Right.
Maybe I'll find
my duende there.</i>

978
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:31,537
No, I've seen you, I've seen you
teach Glee Club, man.

979
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:33,705
<i>u have duende
coming out of your orejas.</i>

980
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,491
Ears.
Ears, right.

981
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:37,759
I got you.
(laughs)

982
00:39:37,827 --> 00:39:38,927
Thank you so much.

983
00:39:38,995 --> 00:39:41,430
Thank you.

984
00:39:41,497 --> 00:39:44,383
So, wait a minute, who ended up
getting the tenure position?

985
00:39:48,738 --> 00:39:50,772
Thank you, Becky.

986
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,026
My online pharmacist
has recommended these

987
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,511
fertility injections every day,
twice a day,

988
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:59,364
until Little Susie
or Little Sylvester catches.

989
00:39:59,449 --> 00:40:00,449
You down with that?

990
00:40:00,516 --> 00:40:01,817
No problem, Coach.

991
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,320
What's wrong?

992
00:40:05,371 --> 00:40:07,506
Coach, I have
a confession to make.

993
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:09,190
Take a seat.

994
00:40:09,242 --> 00:40:10,692
Now, if this is about

995
00:40:10,743 --> 00:40:14,029
the complaint you lodged against
me with Principal Figgins,

996
00:40:14,097 --> 00:40:15,363
I already know.

997
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:16,498
You do, Coach?

998
00:40:16,549 --> 00:40:17,749
Oh, Becky, I've known

999
00:40:17,817 --> 00:40:19,351
ever since
I tinker-tailor-soldier-spied

1000
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:21,470
my way into Figgins's
file cabinet and read

1001
00:40:21,537 --> 00:40:22,504
the evaluation cards.

1002
00:40:22,555 --> 00:40:23,722
And when I saw one

1003
00:40:23,806 --> 00:40:25,207
written in crayon,
I knew it was either

1004
00:40:25,275 --> 00:40:27,476
you or Brittany,
and you're the better speller.

1005
00:40:27,543 --> 00:40:28,594
Coach, I'm sorry.

1006
00:40:28,678 --> 00:40:30,145
I was just looking out
for the team.

1007
00:40:30,212 --> 00:40:33,749
Did you mean what you wrote?

1008
00:40:33,816 --> 00:40:36,218
That you're worried I'm not
as focused on the Cheerios!

1009
00:40:36,286 --> 00:40:37,886
as I used to be?

1010
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:39,438
Well, then you don't
need be sorry.

1011
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:41,773
And thank you for the feedback.

1012
00:40:41,858 --> 00:40:43,224
You're not mad?

1013
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:44,693
No, Becky.

1014
00:40:44,744 --> 00:40:46,111
(sighs)

1015
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:49,915
But impending motherhood
doth given me perspective.

1016
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:53,735
Oh, Becky, I'm reminded
of all my passions: winning,

1017
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:55,003
my girls,

1018
00:40:55,071 --> 00:40:56,872
destroying my enemies.

1019
00:40:56,923 --> 00:40:58,540
Motherhood's not gonna
change that.

1020
00:40:58,591 --> 00:41:01,343
If anything, it makes me
want them far more.

1021
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,962
You're an excellent
co-captain, Becky.

1022
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:05,847
You're like me.

1023
00:41:05,915 --> 00:41:07,582
Not afraid to make
the tough calls.

1024
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:08,900
Coach?

1025
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:10,218
You're gonna be a great mom.

1026
00:41:22,264 --> 00:41:24,950
(school bell ringing)

1027
00:41:37,947 --> 00:41:39,948
There you are, baby.
You ready?

1028
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:41,967
For lunch.

1029
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:43,301
We're going
off-campus, right?

1030
00:41:43,386 --> 00:41:44,836
Hey, Sam.

1031
00:41:57,567 --> 00:41:59,901
(school bell ringing faintly)

1032
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:06,525
What's all this?

1033
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:15,617
"So You Were A Jerk
To Your Fiance."

1034
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:20,672
Not particularly clever,
but I appreciate your pith.

1035
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:25,794
(laughs):
"Congratulations--
I Love You."

1036
00:42:25,845 --> 00:42:27,262
These are wonderful.

1037
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:28,663
They're wonderful.

1038
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:30,098
(both chuckle)

1039
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:33,168
A little myopic maybe,
but a great first effort.

1040
00:42:37,056 --> 00:42:38,607
I'm so proud of you.

1041
00:42:38,674 --> 00:42:41,560
So do I call you Professor
or Madam or what?

1042
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:43,311
I'm not sure of
the protocol here.

1043
00:42:43,362 --> 00:42:44,563
No, no, no,
it's just tenure.

1044
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:45,847
You can call me Emma.

1045
00:42:45,898 --> 00:42:48,349
Or sweetheart
or cutie pie or doll-face.

1046
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:49,451
Or Professor Doll-Face.
Ooh.

1047
00:42:49,518 --> 00:42:50,535
I like Professor Doll-Face.

1048
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,704
(laughs)

1049
00:42:52,789 --> 00:42:54,122
(clears throat)

1050
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,191
My first marriage didn't
work out because my wife

1051
00:42:56,242 --> 00:42:57,459
didn't believe in me.

1052
00:42:57,526 --> 00:43:01,413
And then I go and pull
the same crap on you.

1053
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:05,333
All I know is that right now,
in this moment,

1054
00:43:05,384 --> 00:43:08,920
I just want it to stop.

1055
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:13,225
I want to sit here, eat
some chicken and look back on

1056
00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:15,343
everything you've done
to get to this moment

1057
00:43:15,394 --> 00:43:19,314
and everything I'm going to do
from this moment on

1058
00:43:19,381 --> 00:43:23,885
to make sure you feel...
as special... and amazing

1059
00:43:23,936 --> 00:43:26,655
as I know you are.

1060
00:43:29,454 --> 00:43:34,942
