00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,851
Good evening, Mr. Van Cleve.
Welcome home from your trip.

2
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,419
Hello, Parker. What's going on here?
Mrs. Van Cleve is giving a costume ball.

3
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,057
She has a costume laid out for you...
Napoleon, I believe.

4
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,068
Don't tell her I've arrived.
I haven't slept in two days.

5
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,104
I'm tired.
I'm going upstairs to bed.

6
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:48,868
I don't want to be disturbed by all
these gibbering idiots in monkey suits.

7
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,622
Parker, call
a plumber immediately!

8
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,526
There's a leaky faucet in my
bathroom that'll drive me crazy!

9
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,759
I've got to get some sleep!
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.

10
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,649
Albert, answer the phone!

11
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,219
What are you trying to do,
crack the cement?

12
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,917
<i>Why don't you use your head?
I did, but it hurts that way.</i>

13
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:43,190
I'm gonna have to go back to the
old way. Answer the phone. Go ahead.

14
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,458
Hurry up.
Okay, okay, okay.

15
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:48,330
Hello! Hello! I can't hear
a thing you're sayin', brother.

16
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:51,666
Hello! Hello! Put that
down! There's the phone.

17
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,806
Hello, Ajax Plumbing Company.

18
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,309
We stand behind
every bathtub we sell.

19
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,903
Indeed we do. What?

20
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,845
Eddie.
What?

21
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,408
It's some butler on the phone.
This is gonna be a high-class job.

22
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,512
Oh, yes! That's right,
Ajax Plumbing!

23
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:12,717
We charge six dollars an hour.

24
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,623
That's too much?

25
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,458
Well, then why don't you try
the Atlas Plumbing Company?

26
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,796
They're very cheap.
Thank you. Good-bye.

27
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,639
Atlas Plumbing Company.

28
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,144
Four dollars an hour. What?

29
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,942
They wanted to charge you six,
the Ajax did?

30
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,982
They're nothin'
but a bunch of crooks.

31
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,247
I'm glad you're doin' business with us.
We'll be right over. Thank you.

32
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,584
Ow! Did I hurt you? I'm sorry.

33
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,091
You should be sorry. Now
listen. Put 'em up! Put 'em up!

34
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,561
Put those down. Stop that. I'm
sick and tired of the whole...

35
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,498
Never mind that. You just behave yourself, you
understand? No more monkey business from you.

36
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,794
Oooh, oooh.

37
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,933
Elsie must be around here someplace.
That's her cab. Blow the horn.

38
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,910
Huh? Blow the horn? Blow the
horn! I want to get Elsie.

39
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:11,406
Elsie! Elsie!

40
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:14,282
Listen to me. There's a city
ordinance against blowing horns,

41
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,584
and besides, people
around here want to sleep.

42
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,250
Stop blowing that horn.
Okay.

43
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,259
Go on, blow the horn.
You heard what the cop said.

44
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,386
I said, blow the horn, didn't I?
He said there's a lot of people sleepin'.

45
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,227
So what? Did you put 'em to sleep? Is
it your fault they're in bed? No. No.

46
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,926
Blow the horn!
You sure?

47
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,491
I said blow the horn,
didn't I?

48
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:33,164
<i>Elsie.! Elsie.!</i>

49
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,935
Listen! Didn't I tell you
there was a city ordinance?

50
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,477
Yes, sir. Just a minute,
Officer. You're a public servant.

51
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,478
What of it?
Get me a glass of water.

52
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,709
Why, you little rat! Didn't I tell
you that people are trying to sleep?

53
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,809
Now stop blowing that horn!
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

54
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,946
Go on, blow the horn!
What's wrong with you?

55
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:53,186
I said, blow the horn, didn't I?
Who are you listening to, him or me?

56
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,159
You're a taxpayer, am I right? Yeah.

57
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:58,720
Don't you know that your taxes
help pay that man his salary?

58
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,891
Does he know that?
He will know it.

59
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,026
In other words, he's workin'
for you. Oh, that's different.

60
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,627
So, blow the horn.
Hmm, hmm.

61
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,401
<i>Elsie.!</i>

62
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,840
Elsie! Elsie!

63
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,004
What's the matter with you?
Get that thing off!

64
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,742
You little... I'll break
every bone in your body!

65
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,445
Take it easy. Take it easy. Take it easy.
Watch your blood pressure, kid.

66
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,647
I'm watchin' it.
Take it easy.

67
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,986
I mean, after all, you're workin'
for me. How do you like that?

68
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,686
You're fired.
Okay! Why, you little rat!

69
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,424
Listen, you little squirt! I'm the boss
around here and you're nothin', see?

70
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,763
Boy, you got a nice job.
You bet your sweet life I have.

71
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:40,431
Boss over nothing. Boss over
nothing! How do you like that?

72
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,770
Stop. Stop the noise.
Go away.

73
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:47,006
Take it easy. Take it easy. After all,
let's be nice about the whole thing.

74
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,981
You should pay a little respect to
the man. After all, he's got a badge.

75
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,517
You bet your life. It took me
20 years to earn that badge.

76
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,985
You're gonna show a little
respect for it. Certainly.

77
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:58,114
I'm the limb of the law.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

78
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,557
You're a rotten limb.
Oh!

79
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,787
So, I'm a rotten limb, am I?

80
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,389
Listen, the next crack you make,
I'll break every bone in your body!

81
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,958
<i>Yes, sir. Yes, sir. And he'll do it
too. He's the type guy could do it.</i>

82
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,869
You're not kiddin'!
Okay, okay. See ya later.

83
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,407
Why don't you keep your mouth
shut like your pal? Yeah.

84
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,740
Then you wouldn't get in trouble. He's
always lookin' for fights all the time.

85
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,904
I can see that. What's the
matter? You wanna fight?

86
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,278
Yes, I wanna fight.
I'll fight you.

87
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,010
And I'll fight you.
I'll fight you!

88
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,711
And I'll fight you!
I'll fight you!

89
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,812
And I'll fight you!
No, you won't!

90
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,323
We'd better call it a draw.
I don't want to fight a policeman...

91
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,326
around here where
all the people are lookin'.

92
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,419
You're wearin' a uniform.

93
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,964
I'll fight you over there
in that alley in 15 minutes.

94
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:42,489
I'll be there! Don't forget to
be in the alley in 15 minutes!

95
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:46,402
Don't worry. I'll be there! Don't
have any other cops around to help you!

96
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:50,272
I won't have any cops around. I don't
need 'em! I'll be there all alone!

97
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,312
You're darn right because
I ain't gonna be there! Oh!

98
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,313
Duh!
All right, all right.

99
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,042
Come on. Let's get Elsie.
You caused enough trouble.

100
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,778
Hey! Here comes Elsie now.

101
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,446
Elsie?
Elsie!

102
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,786
What's the matter?

103
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,164
Stop that!
That's my girl.

104
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:17,168
Albert, you've been fighting again.
Mm-hmm.

105
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:20,364
Oh, turn around here.
Look at yourself.

106
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,932
Why don't you try and be a little
more neat? I will from now on, Elsie.

107
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,739
I'll try my best.

108
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,975
If you give me a gold star, I'll
do my best. Now you look sweet.

109
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:33,985
Say, Elsie, we've got a big society
job up at the Van Cleve mansion.

110
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,180
Will you drive us up there?
Sure. Hop in.

111
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:39,190
Swell. Come on.
Come on.

112
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,159
Come here! Where ya going?
Get in there!

113
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,565
Hey, hey, hey.
This cab is taken.

114
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,076
Here you go. Catch.
Would you hold that?

115
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,079
Excuse me. Oh.

116
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,091
Get a load of this!

117
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,356
Elsie, you sit down here, honey.
We'll be back in a minute. All right.

118
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,592
Go ahead, honey.
You listen to the music.

119
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,656
Mm-hmm!

120
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,168
So glad you could come.
Oh, thank you.

121
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,172
Where is it?
Where do we go?

122
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,367
Oh, right in here.

123
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,269
Excuse me.

124
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,375
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

125
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:45,457
A beautiful affair, Mrs. Van
Cleve. Thank you, Mrs. Winthrop.

126
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,493
My dance, Queen Elizabeth!
Oh, my!

127
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,586
I suppose there were wolves,
even in her time.

128
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:56,695
Gloria, where is Peter Evans? He's
coming as a taxi driver, Mother.

129
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,602
He said he'd wear a meter
and charge me to dance with him.

130
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,800
Only the richest bachelor in the world
could afford to be that whimsical.

131
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,571
You'll have to reach an understanding
with him this weekend.

132
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,943
That's the whole point of
our giving a weekend party, isn't it,

133
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,039
to throw us together again
in fond hope?

134
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,813
My dear, I am only suggesting a
merger of the family treasures.

135
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,878
And you, darling, happen
to be the Winthrop treasure.

136
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:24,926
I beg your pardon? Are you
the plumbers from Atlas?

137
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,625
I'm the plumber.
He's my helper, but no help.

138
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,134
Where's the trouble?
Walk this way.

139
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,296
Walk this way.

140
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,749
Good evening, sir.
How are you?

141
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,948
Wait a minute. You can't go in
there. That's a private party.

142
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,357
What about it?
Well, they'll throw you out.

143
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,455
They didn't throw you out. No, they've
been very nice about letting me sit here.

144
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,228
They should. You add a lot of
glamour to this little clambake.

145
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,462
That's a fine way
for a cabbie to talk.

146
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:08,735
- When you get in costume, you really work at it.
- Of course.

147
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,276
Say, I thought I knew
all the cab drivers around here.

148
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,005
<i>Who are you?
Peter Evans.</i>

149
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,344
The Peter Evans? Are you kidding?

150
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:19,782
No, come on in.
I'll get you a couple of affidavits.

151
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,547
Come on.

152
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,455
I go to all these society column
outings. You're a new face.

153
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,890
As a matter of fact,
you're a novelty all over.

154
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,462
<i>Shh. You must be quiet.</i>

155
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,630
Mr. Van Cleve is a very nervous man
and he's trying to sleep.

156
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,574
Shh!

157
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,838
<i>What was that?</i>

158
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,004
It's me, sweetheart.

159
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,742
Well, stop fooling around
and come to bed.

160
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:50,203
Hey, Eddie, what are you doin' in the
bathtub? This ain't Saturday night.

161
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,574
I know it, Albert.

162
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,546
Look out. I don't wanna hurt your
foot. You don't wanna hurt my foot?

163
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:58,447
Yes, you're my friend.

164
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,484
Why, thank you.
Help me out of here, Albert.

165
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,956
Okay, kid.
Take it easy now, Albert.

166
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,391
Be quiet. There's...
Don't strain yourself, Albert.

167
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,395
There's a guy sleeping in
the next room. Yeah, I know.

168
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:14,365
Okay, kid.
That's swell.

169
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,766
Shh! Shh!

170
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,737
Come here! Come here!
Shh.

171
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,672
Don't tell me to shush!
Get over here!

172
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,405
Stand still when I talk to ya. There's
the drip over there. Do ya see it?

173
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,947
Do ya see it? There. That's the
thing that's gotta be fixed. See it?

174
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,505
What do you want me to do,
fix it or drink it? Fix it up!

175
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,916
All right!

176
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,454
Now, shut up!
The man's sleepin'.

177
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,082
Fix that drip!
Okay.

178
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:42,150
I'll give you the "okay. "

179
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,958
<i>Same old Eddie.
Rough-and-tough Eddie.</i>

180
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:49,091
Go on! Fix that drip!

181
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,868
What are you stalling about?
Get with it!

182
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,810
<i>All set?
Pick your tools up.!</i>

183
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:10,049
Keep quiet!
There's a man asleep in there.

184
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,558
All fixed.
All fixed?

185
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:20,562
Look! There's another drip.
Now we've gotta fix that.

186
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,965
You take it easy, Eddie.
Don't work too hard. All right.

187
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,265
Go ahead over and fix it!

188
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,300
Hey, Eddie, there's some
water comin' in here now. What?

189
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:33,743
It's comin' in from this other
thing in the bottom.

190
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,772
Afraid of wetting your feet, eh?
Use your plunger and clean it out.

191
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,841
Okay.
Do I have to tell you everything?

192
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,945
No, no, that's all right.

193
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,889
What are you doin'? What are
you doin'? The plunger, I said.

194
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,721
That's not the plunger!
Give me another chance.

195
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,729
Well, go ahead!

196
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,231
<i>That's it.
I knew it had a handle to it.</i>

197
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,292
<i>Go ahead.</i>

198
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,402
It's stuck!

199
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:07,368
<i>It's stuck. What are you
takin' your shoe off for?</i>

200
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,040
<i>I don't wanna get my shoes wet. Oh.</i>

201
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,124
Eddie, what's the matter?
What's the matter?

202
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,533
Pull on it.
You're always...

203
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,039
Get it off!

204
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,166
Look, Eddie, leave it that way
and I'll take you through the house.

205
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,609
I'll tell 'em I got you at
an auction. Do something!

206
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:42,146
Hold it. Hold it.
Do something. Do something.

207
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,375
Get your hand away.

208
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:49,514
What are you... Get up
there! Give me that hat!

209
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,886
Get up there and fix that!
Get in there!

210
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,152
Don't get mad.
Get up there and fix that leak!

211
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,786
You looked like a rhinoceros.
Over here! Over here!

212
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,695
There's the leak.
Get up there.

213
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:03,326
Now, look. I'll turn the water off
with this valve down here.

214
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,371
Yeah.
There ya are.

215
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,872
Now when ya get it fixed,
whistle. Ya understand?

216
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,875
Soon as I get it fixed, I whistle?
Whistle.

217
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,468
And then you'll turn it on.
Okay. Then I'll turn it on.

218
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:27,325
Turn it off! Turn it off!

219
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,327
Turn it off!

220
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:32,023
Shh! Quiet!
Turn it off!

221
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:36,090
<i>Quiet! Quiet!
Shh! There's a man...</i>

222
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:40,730
Shh! There's a man
sleeping in there.

223
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:43,707
Look, please,
will ya stand still a minute?

224
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,869
What'd ya tell me to do?

225
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,175
I told you if you whistle,
I'd turn it on.

226
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,613
You whistled, didn't ya? I
had something else on my mind.

227
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,584
What'd you have on your mind?

228
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,745
This washed it off.

229
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:59,416
Look, it's still leaking.
Here, take this here.

230
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:04,292
Take this! Don't stand there.
Blow! Blow! Blow!

231
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,422
Quiet! Quiet!
Blow! Blow! Blow!

232
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,058
Shh. Quiet! Shh. The man's asleep.

233
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,035
Look, the trouble lies in
this wall. In here. Yeah.

234
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,572
Try and locate it, will you
please? I'll locate it, Eddie.

235
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,631
Okay.

236
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:22,543
Shh! Not so much noise!
The man's in there asleep. Shh.

237
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:30,754
Hold on to it! Hold on to it!
Hold on to it!

238
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,087
Put your hand on it!

239
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,149
Hey!

240
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:40,094
Go on. Get that one over there!
Excuse me! Excuse me!

241
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,232
Get that one over there!
Hurry up!

242
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,295
That one over there!

243
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,173
<i>Come on. Give me a hand.!
Here!</i>

244
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,905
Push!

245
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,174
Here! Put it... Put it...
Come along!

246
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:09,449
<i>Come here. Come here.!
Come here.!</i>

247
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,462
<i>Get in here.!
Yeah, be right over there.</i>

248
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,125
<i>Come here.!
Come here a minute.! Get in here.!</i>

249
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,169
Get in here! Get in here!

250
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,740
Hold your head there. Hold your
head there! Hold it in there!

251
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,800
Hold that!

252
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,586
Everyone is so nice to me.

253
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,589
I'm afraid my pumpkin shell is
going to change back into mice.

254
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,591
But please don't disappear
at midnight.

255
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,992
I'd have to go all through that glass
slipper routine to find you again.

256
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,657
Of course, if I knew your name, I could
save a lot of time looking for you.

257
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:51,499
I'm Elsie Hammerdingle. Look, I'm
serious. I'd like to see you again.

258
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,734
I'm not kidding. My name is Elsie
Hammerdingle and I drive a taxicab.

259
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,641
Okay, okay, so you're
Elsie Hammerdingle.

260
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,008
I'll see you at the Winthrop
weekend party, won't I?

261
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,014
Well, I...
You've gotta be there.

262
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:07,246
We'll drive out together. I'll pick you
up. But I tell you, I'm a taxi driver.

263
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,913
Sure, sure,
you're a taxi driver.

264
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:13,321
Who is that new girl dancing
with Peter Evans?

265
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,917
They're both dressed
as taxi drivers. Hmm?

266
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:19,589
Looks like competition.
Well, what do I do now?

267
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,099
Didn't you learn anything
in that finishing school?

268
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,479
I feel I'll never walk straight

269
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:39,540
You got me so
I just can't talk straight

270
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,984
No bout adout it
I mean, no doubt about it

271
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:47,287
I'm in love with you

272
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,827
I used to be most capable

273
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,364
Of keeping a conversation

274
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,697
I never ever faltered

275
00:18:56,768 --> 00:19:00,829
In my pronunciation

276
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:07,038
My speech was quite
as flawless as could be

277
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,570
But what did ya do

278
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:14,881
Yes, what did ya do to me

279
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,553
<i>No bout adout it
I mean, no doubt about it</i>

280
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,218
<i>I'm in love with you</i>

281
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,592
No bout adout it
I mean, no doubt about it

282
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,064
What I say is true

283
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:31,466
You're driving me insane
My talk's affected

284
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:35,598
I jumble every line
'cause something in my brain

285
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:40,611
Got disconnected when your lips
connected with mine

286
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,113
No fool, I'm feelin'
I mean, no feel, I'm foolin'

287
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,379
Like a kid of two

288
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,352
I suv you lo much
I mean, I love you so much

289
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:52,652
What am I to do

290
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:55,887
I feel I'll never walk straight

291
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,930
You got me so
I just can't talk straight

292
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,227
No bout adout it
I mean, no doubt about it

293
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,201
I'm in love with you

294
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,568
My train of thought
won't clickity-clack

295
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,608
It's had a terrific smack up

296
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,474
You've gone and knocked it
off of the track

297
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,070
And I just can't get it back up

298
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:19,811
I put my shoes on the pillow

299
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,718
Go to sleep on the floor

300
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,780
I wind up the cat
Put out the clock

301
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,485
And do things I never did before

302
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,529
And ever since we met I prattle

303
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:35,431
Like an itsy-bitsy baby
with a rattle

304
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,798
No fool I'm feelin'
I mean, no feel, I'm foolin'

305
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,962
Like a kid of two

306
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:44,033
I suv you lo much
I mean, I love you so much

307
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,545
What am I to do

308
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,979
I feel I'll never walk straight

309
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:53,506
You got me so
I just can't talk straight

310
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,917
No bout adout it
I mean, no doubt about it

311
00:20:55,988 --> 00:21:00,015
'Cause you're lavermous... marvelous
Funderwul... wonderful

312
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,686
I meely rean it
I really mean it

313
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,991
No bout adout it
I mean, no doubt about it

314
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:08,430
I'm in love

315
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,435
With

316
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:15,803
You

317
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,753
What in the world
are they doing in there?

318
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,160
Run for the hills!
The whole town is flooded!

319
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:53,703
<i>Help.! Help.!</i>

320
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,748
Come on! Come on!
Help! Help!

321
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,992
I wouldn't write 'em any note.
I'd punch 'em in the nose.

322
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,291
I think this letter will do it.
"To the Atlas Plumbing Company.

323
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:15,459
"Sirs, your behavior last night
was an outrageous exhibition.

324
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:19,994
"If you dare send us a bill, we will sue you
for the damages you inflicted upon our home.

325
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:23,838
"Should we ever have plumbing trouble
again and you appear upon our premises,

326
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:27,538
we shall have you assaulted
physically by our servants. "

327
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,376
I'd still punch 'em in the
nose. A letter, Mrs. Van Cleve.

328
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,576
Thank you, Parker.

329
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,350
Oh, Henry, listen to this.

330
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,987
"Dear friends, I would be
delighted to have you...

331
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:48,032
"as my guests at Briarwood
during the coming weekend.

332
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,797
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.
Your friend, Mrs. Roger Winthrop. "

333
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,270
I'd still punch 'em
in the nose.

334
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:57,399
Makes me furious when I think of
what they did to our costume party.

335
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,740
Especially that little fat scoundrel.

336
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,609
<i>This letter should be written
in blood. Their blood.!</i>

337
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,876
Parker, get this off to
those plumbers immediately.

338
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,941
Very well.

339
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,824
Hey, Eddie!
What?

340
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,792
Oh, stop it.

341
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:19,126
What are you doing?
Take it easy! Take it easy!

342
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,461
You all right?

343
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,125
What is this?
That's an invite.

344
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,635
"Dear friends, I would be delighted
to have you as my guests...

345
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,638
"at Briarwood
during the coming weekend.

346
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,435
"I am looking forward
to seeing you again.

347
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:34,036
Your friend, Mrs. Roger Winthrop.
" Hey, this is our big chance.

348
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:37,275
Do you know those big estates up there
have four and five bathrooms each?

349
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,476
Four and five bathrooms?
In one house? Certainly!

350
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,145
Eddie, that's a lot of plumbing.
That's what I'm thinking of.

351
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,054
If we go up there and act as though we belong
in society, we can get all that business.

352
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,058
We'd make a fortune.

353
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,253
You sure we'd make a fortune?
Certainly!

354
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:52,455
Then I can marry Elsie Hammerdingle. Oh!

355
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,625
Oh yes, Eddie!
We made an agreement.

356
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:00,694
Ever since the day I made her a
ring outta the gum wrapper and I...

357
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,706
put it on her thumb.

358
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:08,178
Can you imagine me,
Mr. Elsie Hammerdingle,

359
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,441
the society plumber?

360
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,483
We're really goin' places!

361
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:16,317
Hello, boys. Goin' somewhere? Yeah, we
got an invitation to go to Mrs. Winthrop's.

362
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,049
But it's only for two,
him and I.

363
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,956
How's the plumbing business? We
manage to keep our head above water.

364
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:24,985
That's fine. I dropped in to see you
about that little loan I gave you.

365
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,827
Let me see. It's $1,000, isn't it? Yes.

366
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,197
You just loaned it to us. You'll have
to give us a little time to pay it back.

367
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:34,329
Oh, that's all right. I'm in no hurry. I
know it takes time to get a business going.

368
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,000
Meanwhile, I'd like you to do
me a little favor. Why, sure.

369
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,202
You boys don't wanna be
plumbers all your lives.

370
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,871
Oh, no. We hope someday
to be electricians.

371
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:45,781
Your business takes you
into some pretty rich homes.

372
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:49,287
There's a lot of valuable properties
there worth a lot of money.

373
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:52,118
<i>Wait a minute. You wouldn't
commit a crime, would you? Sure.!</i>

374
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:57,025
No thanks, Mr. Drexel. We'll just
keep on being plain, everyday plumbers.

375
00:24:57,095 --> 00:25:00,929
I never told you fellows this,
but I'm quite a fortune-teller.

376
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,933
I can see into the future.

377
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,266
I see two plumbers.
They're doing pretty good.

378
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,602
More competition.
Shh.

379
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,608
But they're double-crossing a friend
of theirs who gave them their start.

380
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,806
That's what I call beyond grateful.
I have no use for those kind of people.

381
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,281
This friend of theirs
is getting mad.

382
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,810
Now, he wants them to cooperate with
him, or pay back the money he gave them.

383
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,448
He's giving them
till 6:00 tonight to get it.

384
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,220
Suppose they can't get it
by 6:00 tonight?

385
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:31,558
Then I see two plumbers
floating down the river,

386
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,428
and one of them's
a little fat guy.

387
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,969
What's the matter?
The joke is on him.

388
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,698
Why?
I can't swim.

389
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,831
Wait a minute. There's only
two things left to do.

390
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,536
Number one: we've gotta
get $1,000 by 6:00.

391
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,170
Number two: if we don't,
we've gotta get out of town.

392
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,612
We're in serious trouble.
No, we're not. Wait a minute.

393
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,913
It's a lucky thing Mrs. Winthrop
invited us to that weekend affair.

394
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,920
Drexel will never expect
to find us there. Come on.

395
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,252
Hey, Eddie. Wait a minute, Eddie. What?

396
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:03,727
We just can't walk out on the shop like
this. Let's give it a thought for a second.

397
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:05,695
That's long enough.
Come on. Let's go!

398
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,129
Hello, Dan. Oh, hello, Eddie. How are you?

399
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,792
Swell.
Where you bound for?

400
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:13,133
We're gonna spend the weekend
up at Briarwood. Briarwood?

401
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:15,138
Say, you can do me a favor.
Sure, Dan.

402
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,231
You've gotta pass Bagel Street,
see? Where's Bagel Street?

403
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,334
All you have to do is ask
anybody. It's on our way?

404
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:23,142
It's on your way. I want you to deliver
these hats to the Susquehanna Hat Company.

405
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,842
They sent me straws instead of
derbies. That's simple enough.

406
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,908
<i>Hey, Eddie.!
It's about time you got here.</i>

407
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:30,216
Why didn't ya wait for me? We're goin'
up to Briarwood to spend the weekend.

408
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:33,121
And this guy... Does he
go without me? Put your...

409
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:35,455
Okay, Dan. We'll take care
of it. Thank you ever so much.

410
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,961
How have you been? Good. Keep an
eye on the shop while we're gone.

411
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,997
I'll be glad to.
Hold those hats.

412
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:43,466
What are you doing with hats? You've gotta
deliver these to the Susquehanna Hat Shop.

413
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,196
It's on Bagel Street.
Where's Bagel Street?

414
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,932
I don't know. We'll ask. It's on our
way there. How much you say they are?

415
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:51,134
$7.50 a piece. How do I look with
a seven-and-a-half-dollar hat on?

416
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,973
Let me see. Kind of spiffy.
Okay?

417
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,605
Carry those. But don't
get it dirty. Let's go.

418
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:59,013
Bagel Street, eh? We'll
ask somebody. Bagel Street.

419
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,848
Ask this fellow
where Bagel Street is.

420
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,320
Can you tell me where Bagel Street
is? Sorry, haven't got a dime.

421
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,357
Who's asking for money?
I'm only asking where Bagel Street is.

422
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:09,825
Do I know where Bagel Street is? Of course
I know! What do I look like, a dummy?

423
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:13,591
Is there a tag on my lapel saying
"I just came from Ellis Island?"

424
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,566
Of course I know where Bagel Street is.
I was born and raised on Bagel Street.

425
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,728
My brother was born on Bagel
Street. Do you know my brother?

426
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,431
<i>I'm askin' you... Why should you
go around talkin'about my brother?</i>

427
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:24,339
<i>My brother was one of the finest
boys that ever walked in shoe leather.</i>

428
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:27,378
My brother was an honor student.
Say something nasty about my brother.

429
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:29,242
Say something like,
he shouldn't get a parole.

430
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:33,546
I'm asking you where Bagel Street is, a common
ordinary citizen asking where Bagel Street is.

431
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:38,112
I gotta deliver these hats to the Susquehanna
Hat Company. Susquehanna Hat Company!

432
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:40,783
Leave go of me!

433
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:44,226
Is that a Susquehanna hat?
Yeah!

434
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:47,492
You know who makes these?
Child labor! I don't know...

435
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:51,092
Little girls, 13, 14 years old
with curls down to here!

436
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,832
They work 13, 14 hours
a day in a sweatshop!

437
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:58,433
Here's what I think of a Susquehanna
hat, and look at that band!

438
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,479
Imitation leather, just
like paper! And look at that!

439
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:05,710
Seven-and-a-half dollars! Ow! So you put
a wire in there for me to cut my finger!

440
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,718
That's the worst thing
I ever saw!

441
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:11,950
Boy, the Susquehanna Hat Company!
That's what I think of them!

442
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:15,424
You know what that's gonna cost
you, don't you? Give 'em back to Dan.

443
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:18,121
$7.50!
You broke one of Dan's hats!

444
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,893
All I did was put a hat on my head.
Did I ask the guy to take it off?

445
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:25,265
That's enough. It's the way you
ask him. You ask the next guy.

446
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:27,395
Come on. Never mind.
Let's find Bagel Street.

447
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:30,930
Here, ask this lady
where Bagel Street is.

448
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,739
Excuse me, lady. Could you tell me
where Bagel Street is? Bagel Street!

449
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:37,304
Why did you have to remind me
of Bagel Street?

450
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,680
My husband was killed
on Bagel Street! You hear?

451
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:42,948
My husband was killed
on Bagel Street!

452
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:47,424
I don't understand this. I wanna go
to the Susquehanna Hat Company and...

453
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:51,451
Susquehanna Hat Company?
Is that a Susquehanna hat?

454
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,157
That's the same kind of hat my
husband was wearing when he was killed.

455
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,530
He wouldn't have lost his life if
he'd have been wearing a good hat...

456
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:59,297
when that safe fell out
that 15-story building!

457
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,635
But no! He was wearing a hat like this one!

458
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:07,201
That's the cheapest grade
of straw I ever saw!

459
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,337
Oh! My husband's dead!

460
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,678
<i>He's dead.! He's dead.!</i>

461
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,550
He ain't dead, lady. He's hiding!
Now, listen! Just a minute.

462
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,953
That's two hats you've broken.
You know how much you owe Derby Dan?

463
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:21,321
How much I owe Derby Dan now?
Fifteen dollars.

464
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,792
Fifteen dollars.
And stop insulting women.

465
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:27,093
All I asked her is
where was Bagel Street?

466
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,963
Bagel Street!

467
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:34,630
Bagel Street! Don't ever mention
that name! It drives me crazy!

468
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:38,164
Bagel Street! Oh!

469
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:41,110
Wait a minute. Hold that
still! Give him back the hats!

470
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:45,639
Take that box! Go down there and
find out where Bagel Street is.

471
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:49,847
Hey, Eddie, how much do
I owe Dan now? $22.50!

472
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:53,015
I'm gonna try just one more. Be
careful with that one, will you, please?

473
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:56,083
Wait, I've got an idea.
I'm gonna run back to our shop...

474
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,992
and get some of those
little business cards of ours.

475
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:00,292
We can give them away to those
society people up in Briarwood.

476
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:04,062
Very good business idea. But find
out where Bagel Street is, please!

477
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,968
Okay, I'll ask anybody.
I don't care.

478
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:09,404
Excuse me, mister. Could you please
tell me where Bagel Street is?

479
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:13,740
Bagel Street? Don't ask
me where Bagel Street is.

480
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,043
A terrible thing happened to me
on Bagel Street.

481
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,951
I was walking along,
minding my own business.

482
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,886
A safe fell from a 15-story
building on my head...

483
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,947
and killed me!

484
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:30,654
A safe fell 15 floors, fell on
your head and killed ya? Yes.

485
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:34,220
Then as long as you're dead, there's no use
asking you where the Susquehanna Hat Company is.

486
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:38,998
Susquehanna hat! That's the hat I
was wearing the day I was killed!

487
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:43,734
And you ask me about... That's
the kind of hat I was wearing!

488
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:46,208
Oh, no! Eddie!
And you asked me!

489
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,977
You're asking me about...
I'm so sorry.

490
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,986
I... I think I've
broken your hat.

491
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,784
<i>You think you've broken it?
Yeah.</i>

492
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:02,953
This is the fourth Susquehanna
hat... Susquehanna hat...

493
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:06,463
Hey! What's the matter here?
What are you doing to my place?

494
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,091
Hey, police! Help! Help!

495
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:13,365
What's going on here? This big fellow
is trying to kick the little fellow.

496
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,702
My friend!
A tough guy? Come on!

497
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:18,003
You can't take me to jail.
Oh, no?

498
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:21,273
I'm dead. You can't take me to jail!
Oh, yes, we can. Come on, my boy.

499
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,115
He's crazy!
He's crazy.

500
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,117
What can I do for you, Albert?

501
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,745
Luigi, how can I get
to the Susquehanna Hat Company?

502
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:33,086
Susquehanna! Susquehanna!

503
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:35,148
Luigi, what's the matter?
Susquehanna!

504
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:38,286
Luigi! Luigi!

505
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:41,059
Luigi! Luigi! No!

506
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:45,501
<i>Luigi.! No.! Luigi.! Luigi.!</i>

507
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,471
Luigi! What are you doin'?

508
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:53,203
- Luigi!
- Susquehanna! Oh! Oh. Oh.

509
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:00,881
Beautiful out here, isn't it?
Wonderful.

510
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:04,285
It would be heavenly if I could
only get used to you driving.

511
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:07,085
Oh, I get it.
In the taxi business, you drive.

512
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:11,254
What is all this mystery about
you? It's no mystery to me.

513
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:14,856
Here we go again. You're Elsie
Hammerdingle, queen of the cabbies.

514
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:19,165
Yet I met you at the Van Cleve
costume ball. It doesn't make sense.

515
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,933
Peter, how about
letting it go at that?

516
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:25,339
Just for this weekend.
That's all right with me.

517
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:31,579
Oh, you men are all alike, Eddie. Oh!

518
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:35,517
I clean and slave here eight hours a
day and you guys bring in all the dust.

519
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,520
Oh, you men!
Shush. Shush.

520
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:41,319
My goodness, I never seen anything
like this. Take it easy now.

521
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:44,122
Eddie, this is the nicest thing
you did for me today.

522
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,129
What's that? When you
saved these hats for me.

523
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:48,688
Ah, sure. Sure. I think
there's only one left in there.

524
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,495
Hey, Eddie.
Nice job.

525
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:54,561
I think I'll just try just one
more on. You can try one more.

526
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,541
But what excuse are we going to
give to the Susquehanna Hat Shop?

527
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:02,568
Susquehanna!

528
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,207
Take it easy!

529
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:07,478
This is a fine time to lay down!
I wasn't laying down!

530
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,884
Clean the place up.
Clean the place up!

531
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:13,515
Sit down, Eddie. Rest.
Sit down. Rest. Take it easy.

532
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,821
Susquehanna!
I mean, I...

533
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,864
Get it! Get it! Get it!
I got it! I got it!

534
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,632
Come on.
Get out of there.

535
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:36,669
Get out. Get out. Down this way. Hey!

536
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,931
Stop it!

537
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,544
Oh, no!

538
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:25,852
How are you, Pipps? Fine.
Thank you, sir. And you?

539
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,591
Fine.

540
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,004
Peter, I'm delighted.

541
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,064
The weekend wouldn't have been the same
without you. Now, run right to the pool.

542
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:40,406
Gloria is putting together a musical
number for the lawn party this afternoon.

543
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,412
That's fine. We'll go right over.
"We"?

544
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,175
You know Elsie.

545
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,716
How do you do, my dear?
I don't believe we've ever met.

546
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:52,449
Of course you met Elsie,
at the Van Cleve costume ball.

547
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:56,789
Oh, one of their horsey set. Well, any
friend of Peter's is welcome to Briarwood.

548
00:34:56,861 --> 00:35:01,662
<i>Will you be quite comfortable? Oh, yes,
your butler showed me to a lovely guest room.</i>

549
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:05,463
How charming. I do hope you'll
enjoy your weekend. Thank you.

550
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,470
Come on.
Let's find Gloria.

Now the weekend is a success.
Thanks for those kind words.

584
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,360
Elsie and I drove up together.
Elsie?

585
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:22,668
You know Miss... Oh, of course.
You sang at the Van Cleve ball.

586
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,833
That's right.
You wore a cab driver's outfit.

587
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:28,436
It's certainly a relief
to get out of that uniform.

588
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:31,242
I can't get over this place.
It's so beautiful.

589
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,715
I'm sure your estate
is just as large.

590
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:38,949
No, we live over the grocery
store. Am I hearing things?

591
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:42,959
Hallucinations. She thinks she's a lady
taxicab driver named Elsie Hammerdingle.

592
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:45,860
Not even a hyphen between
the Hammer and the dingle.

593
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,797
What, no hyphen?
That's just too, too whimsical.

594
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:52,996
But, if you care for that kind of humor, from
now on I'll be Gussey Pumpernickel, lady janitor.

595
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:38,539
This way, gentlemen. Uh, are you quite
sure you've come to the right place?

596
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,982
Oh, yes. We have
an invitation, mister.

597
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:44,419
Oh, you needn't call me mister.
I'm the butler.

598
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,855
Okay, Mr. Butler. Here's the invitation.
She give it to us right there.

599
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,916
Yes.
Thank you.

600
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:56,723
Here's your room, gentlemen.
I hope you like it.

601
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:59,770
Like it? Who in the world
wouldn't like this room?

602
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,829
You mean this one room
for the two of us?

603
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:06,001
And another thing, who cut this
bed in half? What's the matter?

604
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,875
They're twin beds. Will you keep
quiet. Do we look like twins?

605
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,914
You have a very rigorous
schedule here.

606
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:14,576
You bath at 10:00,
brunch at 11:00, tea at 2:00.

607
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:18,452
I always have a very, very
"ridgerous" schedule. I always do.

608
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:22,424
I washbasin at 8:00. And then I doughnut
at 9:00. I pinball machine at 10:00.

609
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:25,894
I hamburger and onions at 11:00
and then I bicarbonate of soda at 12:00.

610
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:28,090
That settles everything.

611
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:30,326
It sure does.

612
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:34,235
Pay no attention to my friend here.
He's very eccentric, but very wealthy.

613
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,536
If you'll pardon me, gentlemen,
I'll be back in a moment. Yeah, sure.

614
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,636
Say.
What's the matter?

615
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,203
The Winthrop's, they're
very fine people. Why?

616
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:46,977
Look at all the nice clothes
they're lending us.

617
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,214
Well, let 'em think
that we're used to it, you know.

618
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:53,552
Don't act surprised.
And remember your etiquette.

619
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,251
Etiquette?
Etiquette.

620
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:57,385
You tryin' to tell me? You
can't learn me nothin' like that.

621
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:00,089
You don't even know how
to say the word. Etiquette?

622
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,325
No, "ah-tick-it-tee. "
Etiquette!

623
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,334
Ah-tick-it-tee!
I said, etiquette!

624
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,869
<i>You don't have to tell me
about all that stuff...</i>

625
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:08,131
<i>because my mother told me
the right road from the wrong road.</i>

626
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,799
If my mother thought I was gonna do
something wrong, she would always tell me.

627
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,809
Because I had the right kind
of bringing up.

628
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,869
Gentlemen, your bath is drawn. Erase it.

629
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:17,436
What?
Rub it out!

630
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:21,645
Shh, not so loud.
My friend is very humorous too.

631
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,586
You've got to take a bath!
Quiet. Not so loud!

632
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,589
Right?
Quite.

633
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,591
Right.

634
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:31,651
Sir, if I may start
undressing you now.

635
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:34,596
You're gonna undress me?
Yes, sir.

636
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:37,327
The last person that ever
undressed me was my mother,

637
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:39,335
and that was a year ago.

638
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:41,394
Ayear ago?

639
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,439
You gotta start to learn
to undress yourself...

640
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,807
sometime or other by yourself,
don't you?

641
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:49,470
Right.
Quite.

642
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:51,538
Right.
Oh.

643
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,641
If you'll allow me, I'll take
your coat. Thank you. Shall I?

644
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:58,279
Give the man your coat.
Okay. Okay.

645
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:00,346
No arguments needed.

646
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:02,392
Your tie, sir.

647
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,655
Handle this stuff very nicely.

648
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:07,288
Your tie, sir.
Don't fight. Take it easy.

649
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:08,956
Give the man...
Please, please, please!

650
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,967
Don't fight me.
I'm not fighting, sir.

651
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:13,936
Give the man your tie!
Take it off!

652
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:16,370
All right, I'll give the
guy... All right... Shh!

653
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,601
Put 'em down!
Shh, quiet!

654
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:21,201
Will you tell him to put his
hands down? Let me have your tie.

655
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:24,179
All right!
Put your hands down!

656
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:28,412
You don't have to fight
about it. Here.

657
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,420
Thank you.
There's nothing to it.

658
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,480
Thank you very much.
Now your shirt, sir.

659
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,491
My shirt?
Yes.

660
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:38,027
I don't get it...
Take it off!

661
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:41,258
I know how to undress myself. Nobody has
to tell me. Show the man you can do it.

662
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,267
I mean, I know...
I know how to do this.

663
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,269
I'm sure you do.
Oh, take it off!

664
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,862
All right, all right.
Take yours off too.

665
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:51,601
Your pants, sir.
Think they'll fit you?

666
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:56,078
Take the pants off! Okay. All
right. I mean, after all...

667
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,410
Put your leg up,
sir, will you?

668
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,848
No, no. Please, sir.

669
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,545
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Just a minute.

670
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,986
All right, all right.
Take it easy.

671
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:07,523
There you are.
Get up on your feet. Get up.

672
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,388
Okay. Now...

673
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,588
I think you're ready now, sir.
My "bawth" is ready?

674
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:15,598
Yes, sir.
Um, I will go.

675
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,827
And I think I will return in a jiffy.

676
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,029
I dare say, a "fortnit. "

677
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,263
Toodle-loo.

678
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:27,041
Oh, yes.

679
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,979
<i>Mrs. Winthrop.
Yes?</i>

680
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,043
Something terrible has
happened. What's the matter?

681
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:40,784
Our luggage has disappeared.
Vanished into the thin air.

682
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:43,691
I think it was misappropriated
by one of your servants.

683
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:46,992
Impossible! I trust them all implicitly.
Why, they've been with me for years.

684
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:51,330
It couldn't be one of the
guests. No, out of the question.

685
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,963
That's absurd. I'm sure your luggage
was just misplaced. I'll speak to Pipps.

686
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,701
Perhaps he can find some clothes
for you for the time being.

687
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,800
Baron! Look!

688
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:15,655
Look at that person. He's
wearing a blazer just like mine.

689
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:18,126
Who in the world is he?

690
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,759
How do you do?
How do you do?

691
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,823
A "ridgerous" schedule, isn't it?

692
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,562
Quite.
Quite.

693
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,900
Allow me to present Baron
Sergei. How do you do?

694
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:31,567
<i>No, not me.
There. Baron Sergei.</i>

695
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:34,042
And Count Alexis.

696
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:40,207
I don't believe
I got your name.

697
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,616
Oh, of course not. If you had
my name, you would be my sister.

698
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:46,315
Good-bye. Good-bye.

699
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:50,952
When I see Mrs. Winthrop, I will tell
her about you. But I'm Mrs. Winthrop.

700
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:55,021
All right. When you see her, you tell
her about me. Thank you. Toodle-loo.

701
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,530
Remarkable.

702
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:08,435
I wanna go to sleep

703
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:16,043
I wanna go to sleep

704
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,486
And dream

705
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:23,424
That dream I had last night

706
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:28,454
Well, what do you know He smiled
at me in my dreams last night

707
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:32,935
My dreams are gettin' better
all the time

708
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:37,372
And what do you know
He looked at me in a different light

709
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:41,810
My dreams are gettin' better
all the time

710
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:43,972
To think that we were strangers

711
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:46,073
A couple of nights ago

712
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:50,450
And though it's a dream
I never dreamed he'd ever say hello

713
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,546
Well, maybe tonight
he'll hold me tight

714
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,887
When the moonbeams shine

715
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:59,224
My dreams are gettin' better
all the time

716
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:04,063
Music's playin'
while we're swayin'

717
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:07,968
To a lovely strain

718
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,029
Lights are low

719
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:12,735
And now I know

720
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:16,007
Soon we'll meet again

721
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:21,245
Well, what do you know He smiled
at me in my dreams last night

722
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:25,186
My dreams are gettin' better
all the time

723
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:29,316
And what do you know
He looked at me in a different light

724
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:33,693
My dreams are gettin' better
all the time

725
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:35,994
To think that we were strangers

726
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,159
A couple of nights ago

727
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,864
And though it's a dream
I never dreamed he'd ever say hello

728
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:44,499
Well, maybe tonight
he'll hold me tight

729
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,668
When the moonbeams shine

730
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:51,238
My dreams are gettin' better
better all the time

731
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:55,342
Better and better and better
all the time

732
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:04,283
I wanna go to sleep

733
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:10,795
I wanna sleep

734
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:17,831
And dream

735
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,957
There you are, Albert.
You know, you look swell.

736
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:46,764
What do ya think?
Too much tie.

737
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:49,169
No, no, no, no. That's swell.
Now let's go downstairs.

738
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:52,265
And be careful how you act at all
times. Never mind! Put that down!

739
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:58,513
Albert! Eddie!

740
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,948
Hello, Elsie.
What are you doing here?

741
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:05,387
We were invited. We got an
invitation. We're society plumbers.

742
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:08,583
How did you get here?
It's all such a crazy thing.

743
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,991
I met Peter Evans
at the Van Cleve party.

744
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:14,189
He thought I was one of the guests
and offered to drive me out here.

745
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:17,791
But you're not one of the guests.
You must have told him a big fib.

746
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:21,895
I told him I was Elsie Hammerdingle,
but he wouldn't believe me.

747
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:25,601
And I let him go on thinking
that I belonged with these people.

748
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:29,271
<i>But why?
Because I wanted to come here.</i>

749
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,280
I wanted this weekend
to remember.

750
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,714
I know how you feel, Elsie.

751
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:36,116
I felt the same way when
you and I went on those picnics.

752
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:39,280
I know as soon as they find out
who I am, they'll throw me out,

753
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:44,123
but in the meantime, I have this one memory
to dream about for the rest of my life.

754
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,128
You love Peter Evans,
don't you?

755
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:49,859
He's spoiled me for every man
I'll ever meet after this.

756
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:51,867
He's wonderful, ain't he?

757
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:54,768
I guess you thought you were gonna
get stuck with a little fat plumber.

758
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:58,535
Oh, come, come, come. Look, Elsie,
we'll do everything to help you out.

759
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:01,840
Yes. I'm gonna try hard, Elsie.
We'll make these people think...

760
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:04,881
we were the best brought-up
society people they ever saw.

761
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:06,779
I'll put on the dog
just for you, Elsie.

762
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:10,183
That a boy. It's breaking my heart,
but I'm gonna do it for Elsie.

763
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:12,188
That's swell.
Thanks, Albert.

764
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:14,918
You're the second-nicest boy
I know.

765
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:18,928
Hmm.

766
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:22,756
Oh.
What's the matter?

767
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:25,028
Eddie.
What?

768
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:27,662
I'll never wash my face
as long as I live.

769
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,571
Oh... Oh, come on. Go ahead.

770
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,575
Oh, Eddie... Put your
hat on. Never mind that.

771
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:34,838
Don't rub it off! Don't
rub it off! All right.

772
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,073
Pick your hat up.
Pick your hat up.

773
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:40,048
I'm sorry, gentlemen, that our
clothes are not an exact fit.

774
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:44,315
I did my best, of course.
Look! Those men again.

775
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:49,792
Again their clothes look
familiar. Remarkable!

776
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,124
Hey, Eddie.
Now what's wrong?

777
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:55,255
I don't know what's wrong with this coat,
but it seems like there's some starch up here.

778
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,698
Look it here. Look at this!

779
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:01,101
What's the matter? Now sit
down and behave yourself!

780
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:06,267
How do you do?
How do you do?

781
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:08,868
This is the first opportunity I've had
to welcome you to Briarwood.

782
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:12,211
How do you do, Mrs. Briarwood? I'm
not Mrs. Briarwood. I'm Mrs. Winthrop.

783
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,773
This is Mrs. Winthrop.
Then you two have met before.

784
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:17,547
No, not him. You, I have
met. You met me before?

785
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,555
Yes.
Then we're old friends.

786
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,557
Of course, you know
this party is for charity.

787
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,253
<i>I'm selling tickets to view our rare,
old family treasure, The Plunger.</i>

788
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:26,819
I think that's a very good idea,
don't you, Edward?

789
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:28,888
Yes, yes.
What did you say?

790
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,992
<i>To view our rare, old family
treasure, The Plunger. The plunger?</i>

791
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:34,299
It's gonna cost money
to look at a plunger?

792
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:36,669
Why, of course.
Five dollars apiece.

793
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,073
Lady, are you gonna charge
everybody here for that? Yes.

794
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,077
Get 'em all together
in one group,

795
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,204
and I got a plunger you
can look at for nothin'.

796
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:47,341
Ah, but yours must be an
imitation. No, it's the real thing.

797
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:50,250
<i>But my Plunger has been
in the family 150 years.</i>

798
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,912
150 years?
Yes.

799
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,923
Don't you think it's about time
you threw it out?

800
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:58,257
Its exquisite coloring has never
been surpassed. It's worth $150,000.

801
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,626
Oh, it must be a beaut.

802
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:03,632
How many tickets will you have?
It's worth its weight in gold.

803
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,691
This I gotta see, Eddie.

804
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,703
I wanna see this.
Yeah.

805
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:09,705
How much are the tickets?
Five dollars apiece.

806
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:13,937
Very cheap. Very cheap. Say no
more. Pay the lady for the tickets.

807
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,912
<i>Pay the lady.!</i>

808
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,710
You just put your hand in your pocket,
but you never come out with nothin'.

809
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:22,752
Very eccentric.
Is that so?

810
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:26,084
Pay the lady! All right! All
right! Two tickets to see a plunger.

811
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:28,556
Thank you so much. Just this
way, gentlemen. Yes, surely.

812
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,957
Oh, I don't seem
to recall your names.

813
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,997
I'm Mr. Harrington.
This is, uh, Mr. Mansfield.

814
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:37,158
Of the Little Rock Mansfields.
Oh! How do you do?

815
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,259
Take an arm?
Right this way. Of course.

816
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:41,702
I know you'll enjoy it immensely.

817
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:43,740
Get away from the tree!
Pay no attention to him.

818
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:48,107
Peter, I've been looking all over
for you. Well, Miss Dinglehammer.

819
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:50,237
That's Hammerdingle.

820
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:54,215
Oh, of course, the lady cab driver. Don't
you think you ought to call your stand?

821
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:57,583
<i>You may have some fares.
I'm not working this weekend.</i>

822
00:50:57,654 --> 00:51:00,748
It seems to me
you're working overtime.

823
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:04,487
Will you walk me to the
unveiling, Peter? Certainly.

824
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,961
Come on, Elsie.

825
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:24,446
<i>Pardon me, Mrs. Winthrop.</i>

826
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:27,847
May I take your photograph with these
two gentlemen for our society page?

827
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,045
Why, of course, it's okay. Go right ahead.

828
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,920
Don't forget to mention that next week
we're having a sale on secondhand washers.

829
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:40,123
Thank you. If they come out good,
I'd like about a dozen. Thank you.

830
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:42,961
Well, now, about to see the
plunger. The plunger, yes.

831
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,524
Let's see it.
I'm just about to unveil it.

832
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,934
A plunger with a veil?
I don't know.

833
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:50,632
If you please.
The plunger.

834
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:58,737
What kind of plunger is that? That must be
the bathroom door. The plunger must be inside.

835
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:01,875
Don't you understand?
That's the plunger there.

836
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,886
That's the plunger?
That big guy standing up.

837
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,888
That's a painting or something.
That's a gambler.

838
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,890
Any man that gambles
is a plunger.

839
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,052
Any man that gambles they call
a plunger? If he gambles heavy.

840
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:14,222
<i>Then it's just a painting. That's
all. Expensive painting too.</i>

841
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:17,130
How much that cost?
$150,000.

842
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,134
You was cheated, Mrs. Winthrop.
What?

843
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:21,693
I don't even see $100,000
worth of chips on the table.

844
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,898
Unless they got it
in their pockets.

845
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,587
This is the place
I'm looking for, isn't it?

846
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:46,294
To be sure, sir.
My name is Drexel.

847
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:48,558
I'm a friend of Mr. Harrington
and Mr. Mansfield.

848
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:53,126
What you mean is that Mrs. Winthrop
invited Mr. Peter Evans for the weekend,

849
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:54,966
he invited Miss Hammerdingle,

850
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:57,199
she invited Mr. Harrington
and Mr. Mansfield,

851
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:59,708
and they in turn invited you.

852
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:02,006
Yes, we are
a very hospitable group.

853
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:06,772
Drexel!
Marlow!

854
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,909
What are you doing here?

855
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:10,919
I'm something
of an art collector.

856
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:13,319
I understand there's
a valuable painting here.

857
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,915
<i>Oh, yeah, The Plunger.</i>

858
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:19,928
The last time we met you were doing a stretch for
collecting paintings without the owner's permission.

859
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:22,794
This time my work
is purely as supervisor.

860
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,391
I've got two stooges
on the inside.

861
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:27,595
All of a sudden,
I'm an art collector too.

862
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:30,731
Count me in.
I'm your partner.

863
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:38,110
<i>Save me.! Help.!
Help.! Help.! Save me.!</i>

864
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:44,717
<i>Save me.! Help.! Help.!</i>

865
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:51,253
Help!
Hold on me, boy!

866
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,963
Get up here.
Go ahead, kid.

867
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,409
I'm gonna sue you
in every court in this world!

868
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:11,447
What's the matter?
Didn't I just save your life?

869
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:14,642
Yeah, but where's my hat?

870
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:19,087
What in the world is this? How do you
like this guy? I just saved his life!

871
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:20,747
You saved whose life?
His.

872
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:22,849
Do you know this guy?
No.

873
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,224
You had no license
to go out after that man.

874
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:28,162
You gotta have a license
to go save a guy?

875
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:30,597
You want me to run
downtown to the "brureau"...

876
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,794
and say, "Gimme a license.
I want to save a man"?

877
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:35,531
There's lifeguards.
They've got families.

878
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:39,598
Those families depend on the
salaries those lifeguards earn...

879
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:42,941
to jump in swimming pools
and oceans and save people.

880
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:45,311
And you... As soon
as their back is turned,

881
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:48,613
you deliberately sneak into the
pool and do the work for nothing!

882
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,984
Don't ever do a thing like
that! I'm sorry I saved you.

883
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:53,886
You should be sorry!

884
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:57,484
Do you mind very much
if I settle this argument?

885
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,462
I wish you would. You tell Eddie
everything. Thank you very much.

886
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:07,060
Well, that's better.
Wait! Wait!

887
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,731
I'm gonna run down and get a
license! I'll be right back!

888
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:13,071
<i>Wait there.!
Keep out of people's business.</i>

889
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,805
Mr. Drexel. Eddie and Al,
how are you? Glad to see ya.

890
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:18,370
You're not mad at us?
Of course not. I'm your pal.

891
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:20,939
What about the $1,000?
Let's not talk about that now.

892
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:23,952
What are you doing here? I'm here
on business. Maybe you can help me.

893
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,955
Certainly. There's a package I'd
like you to carry home for me.

894
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:30,424
Sure. He's the greatest package
carrier. I'd be glad to help.

895
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,984
What's in it?
It might be a painting.

896
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:34,997
<i>The Plunger?
It could be.</i>

897
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:38,398
Well, we won't help. If you do
anything like that, we'll expose you!

898
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:41,904
You heard that, didn't you? You do anything
like that and we'll turn the hose on you!

899
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:45,099
I was just trying to test your
honesty. I'm glad you stand the test.

900
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,336
Run along and
enjoy yourselves.

901
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:51,369
We stand all kind of tests. Just
keep testing us. Test us. Come on!

902
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:54,212
What did they say?

903
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:58,220
They said they'd expose me
to Mrs. Winthrop if I try anything.

904
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:02,349
How are your knives these days?
I still keep them sharp and handy.

905
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:08,260
Just this way, please.

906
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:10,959
Mrs. Winthrop asked me to bring
you two gentlemen down here...

907
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,161
so you could choose your mounts
for the fox hunt.

908
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:15,170
Fox hunt?
Oh, certainly.

909
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:17,934
What would a weekend be
without a fox hunt?

910
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:20,066
You know, last season
all we shot was grouse.

911
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,008
Oh, and I bagged three
of the "greese" myself.

912
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:23,602
Greese?
Greese.

913
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,013
Greese is not plural.
It ain't "sinjular. "

914
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,017
I mean, after all...
Yes, indeed...

915
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:31,280
Well, my good man,
get me my mount.

916
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:33,584
And get me the biggest mount
that you got.

917
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:36,716
What's a mount?
A mount's a horse.

918
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:44,091
Hey! Don't...

919
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:48,661
You... You can kill somebody with those.
Now, cut it out. Hey, Eddie, are you gonna...

920
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:52,572
What did ya do to Eddie?
What did ya do to Eddie?

921
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:10,121
Now, are you gonna help
Drexel with the job?

922
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:13,788
I won't give in, Eddie.
I won't give in.

923
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:17,765
<i>With this last knife I'm
gonna hit ya right in the head.</i>

924
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:22,828
<i>Wait a minute. Every condemned man
has a last request to make.</i>

925
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:25,534
<i>What's yours?</i>

926
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:30,602
<i>Before you throw that last knife,
will you please take your hat off?</i>

927
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,376
<i>All right.
Thank you.</i>

928
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,010
I don't want to see this.

929
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:43,689
<i>Hey, did he get you?
Yeah.</i>

930
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,126
<i>Where?
In the belt.</i>

931
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:50,132
<i>Well, come on. Pull up your pants,
and let's get out ofhere. Okay.</i>

932
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,174
So sorry about
your clothes, gentlemen.

933
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:02,803
Oh, it is nothing, madame.
Your butler did the best he could.

934
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:06,212
I'm afraid the fox will be ashamed
to be pursued by us.

935
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,114
Good hunting, Peter.
Thank you, Gloria.

936
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:13,212
If we'd had more advance notice we could
have arranged for a horse with a meter.

937
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:17,123
Take care of the plumbers?
Don't worry about them.

938
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:19,957
I fixed it so they get the wildest
animals in the stable. Fine.

939
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:23,487
The little fat guy's horse
is a killer.

940
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:28,164
Come on, Buck.

941
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:33,505
<i>Giddyap, boy.
Come on, come on, come on.</i>

942
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:35,510
Come on!
Whoa! Whoa, boy! Whoa!

943
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,108
Albert, I wonder why
that groom...

944
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,447
wanted us to ride
those four-legged killers.

945
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:46,046
I don't know. The 20 bucks
certainly changed his mind.

946
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:48,886
It was my 20.
I know. It's...

947
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:51,222
What are you doing with
the rope? That's my lasso.

948
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:53,455
When I see the fox, I'm gonna lasso
him, and then I'll bulldoze him,

949
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,964
and then I'll hog-tie him,
and then I'm gonna brand him.

950
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:59,695
And if I like the fox real well,
I'll make a watch fox of him.

951
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,909
Yoicks and away!

952
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:11,845
Yoicks, Mr. Mansfield!
Yoicks to you too!

953
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:30,090
Albert! Albert!

954
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:38,002
Oh, fox! Here, fox!

955
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:40,736
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Here, fox!

956
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,239
Here, fox!

957
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:50,616
Fox!

958
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,416
<i>Here, fox.</i>

959
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:54,888
Here, fox!

960
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:57,358
Here, fox.

961
01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:03,192
Here, fox...

962
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,757
Uh-oh, the fox.

963
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:01,320
Uh-oh, another bridge.

964
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:08,825
Take it easy!

965
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:11,492
Eddie! Eddie!

966
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:13,626
Hey, Eddie!

967
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:20,173
Fox!

968
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:28,016
Albert!
Where are you, Albert?

969
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:33,522
Whoa, Harry! Whoa!

970
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:40,025
Get outta the way!
Get outta the way!

971
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:46,160
Get outta the way!
Get outta the way!

972
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:48,328
Hey, hey, come on! Come on!

973
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:54,704
<i>Outta the way.! Look out.!
Look out.! Scatter.!</i>

974
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:57,803
Get outta the way!
Get outta the way!

975
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,839
<i>Get outta the way.!
Outta the way.!</i>

976
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:15,897
Hey.

977
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:17,933
Oh. Kitten.

978
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,491
Remarkable.

979
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:31,806
<i>Whenever I look at you</i>

980
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:37,343
The cloudiest sky is blue

981
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:43,926
From nowhere
the sun breaks through

982
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:48,623
What a change in the weather

983
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:54,636
<i>Whenever your lips

Flowers bloom in the wintertime

986
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:11,812
What a change in the weather

987
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:15,119
You merely smile at me

988
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:19,560
And robins sing

989
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,995
A humdrum world

990
01:03:22,064 --> 01:03:24,532
Becomes

991
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:29,970

992
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:39,749

Excuse me.
Sure.

1020
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:23,269
Please, Mr. Osborne.

1021
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:26,873
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my painful duty to announce...

1022
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:29,747
<i>that my famous painting,
The Plunger, has been stolen.</i>

1023
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:32,913
<i>I know none of my guests
could possibly be involved,</i>

1024
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:37,585
<i>but I must request you all to remain in
this room until the police investigate.</i>

1025
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,857
Mother, I don't think any
investigation will be necessary.

1026
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:43,865
There's several suspicious strangers
among us whom we accepted as guests...

1027
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:46,299
<i>because they were
Peter Evans's friends.</i>

1028
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:49,668
<i>Those two men are a couple of plumbers,
and that girl is a taxi driver.</i>

1029
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:52,173
They're here under false pretenses.
They're the criminals.

1030
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:56,302
- I don't believe it.
- You're right. But we know who the criminal is.

1031
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:58,939
Mr. Drexel told us he was coming
up here to steal your painting.

1032
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,949
If I may interrupt, madame.

1033
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:04,111
Mr. Drexel is a friend
of these gentlemen.

1034
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:07,622
<i>Then they're all in it together.
Pipps, call the police.</i>

1035
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,351
Hey!
Hey, look!

1036
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:17,190
It's Drexel and the chauffeur.
They're trying to escape!

1037
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:19,234
We gotta get 'em so we
can clear Elsie! Right!

1038
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:21,496
Come on!

1039
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:23,970
Stop them!

1040
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:29,738
We can catch them
with this fire truck.

1041
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:35,682
Where's the fire? Come on,
come on, come on, come on!

1042
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:37,343
Oh, boy!

1043
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:48,891
Follow that car!

1044
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:10,183
Hey, take it easy, chief.
This is my first ride in a fire truck.

1045
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:13,710
Mine too, buddy! Whoopee!

1046
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:23,360
Step on it, Marlow.
I think that fire truck's following us.

1047
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:35,974
Take it easy, chief.
Take it easy.

1048
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:46,116
Get outta the way, everybody!
Get outta the way! Get outta the way!

1049
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:16,881
Crowd 'em into the curb.

1050
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:48,349
Turn around.
Let's head for Briarwood.

1051
01:10:29,124 --> 01:10:31,092
Keep your mind on the wheel!
But I'm hungry.

1052
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:44,098
He's crazy.

1053
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:14,100
Get him!
Come on! Get him!

1054
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:21,332
Throw him over!

1055
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:27,081
I took care of him.

1056
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:32,280
Hey, he's over here!
Wait! He's on the running board.

1057
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:34,822
Don't do that!

1058
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:55,067
Finger! My finger!
My finger! My...

1059
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,761
<i>What was that? What was that?</i>

1060
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:35,683
Here's your painting, Mrs. Winthrop. You'll
never know the time I had getting it back.

1061
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:38,845
<i>The time you had? It was me, Eddie. Albert.</i>

1062
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:42,823
<i>- You and Eddie are heroes.
I want to apologize for accusing you.</i>

1063
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:45,519
You may be plumbers,
but you're wonderful plumbers.

1064
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:47,528
<i>Thank goodness my Plunger is safe.</i>

1065
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:49,530
You still are a couple of thieves.

1066
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:51,793
The clothes you have been
wearing belongs to us.

1067
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:54,165
<i>They've wrecked The Plunger.</i>

1068
01:12:54,236 --> 01:12:57,728
Hey, the guy on the left
is cheating. He is.
