1
00:01:03,932 --> 00:01:08,338
<i>Shibuyama - In front of Hacchiko Plaza</i>

2
00:01:17,723 --> 00:01:19,337
<i>Daidokoron
Wait right there!</i>

3
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:38,834
As long as Yatterman is here,

4
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:42,431
evil will not prosper in this world!

5
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:48,689
We will summon light into this world of darkness! We are Yatterman...

6
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:49,409
Number 1!

7
00:01:50,452 --> 00:01:51,599
Number 2!

8
00:01:53,357 --> 00:01:55,100
At your service!

9
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:57,820
At your service, koron!

10
00:01:59,343 --> 00:02:00,322
Omochama!

11
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:03,574
You're totally blocking our shot.

12
00:02:03,574 --> 00:02:06,409
Ah! S-s-sorry, koron!

13
00:02:08,267 --> 00:02:10,394
Yatterwan!

14
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:12,532
Come out of there, Doronbo!

15
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:29,496
- Okay!
- Here you go!

16
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:34,351
Dun dugudun dugudun dugudun!

17
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:54,103
So it was you guys after all.

18
00:02:54,103 --> 00:02:55,468
You won't get away with this!

19
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,883
Boyacky, Tonzra, get them!

20
00:03:00,716 --> 00:03:02,552
Yes, Mistress!

21
00:03:08,227 --> 00:03:09,534
Take that!

22
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,766
And that!

23
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:27,184
Oh snap!

24
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,457
I missed!

25
00:03:33,457 --> 00:03:34,541
Kendamagic!

26
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:45,788
Ow ow ow ow!
That's hot!

27
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:01,615
Huh?

28
00:04:47,637 --> 00:04:48,989
Kendamagic!

29
00:04:54,183 --> 00:04:55,414
Whoa! Whoa!
Shocking!

30
00:04:56,361 --> 00:04:58,321
Oh! Ah! Shock!!

31
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,894
Electric stick.

32
00:05:17,357 --> 00:05:18,669
Mistress Doronjo!

33
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:20,920
We lose every week!

34
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:25,847
Boyayan!

35
00:05:46,938 --> 00:05:49,625
Isn't that great, Boyayan?

36
00:05:56,341 --> 00:05:57,795
Perv!

37
00:05:59,178 --> 00:06:00,675
Oh, Boyayan!

38
00:06:00,675 --> 00:06:02,293
Boyayan!

39
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:10,599
Get them with this Daidokoron!

40
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:12,128
Yes, Mistress!

41
00:06:14,552 --> 00:06:15,900
Starting with the right foot!

42
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:27,285
Hot pot! Tea kettle! Knife! Chopsticks!

43
00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:30,037
Teacup! Frying pan! Pan!

44
00:06:30,134 --> 00:06:31,167
Ow ow ow!

45
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,109
Hang in there! Hang in there!

46
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,857
Yatterwan!

47
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:44,813
Ladle!

48
00:06:48,065 --> 00:06:49,387
Alright!

49
00:06:49,387 --> 00:06:50,582
Boyacky!

50
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:53,867
You showed them! You sure are a genius!

51
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:56,551
Not at all, Mistress Doronjo!

52
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:59,519
Carrot Missile Attack!

53
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,554
Everyone, say it with me:

54
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,299
Ready, here we go!

55
00:07:17,846 --> 00:07:18,705
Fire!

56
00:07:31,565 --> 00:07:33,828
You can do it, Yatterwan!

57
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,027
He's in trouble, koron!

58
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,339
They got me, woof.

59
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:39,939
- Are you okay?
- Don't worry.

60
00:07:40,484 --> 00:07:43,308
Yatterwan! I've got a Mecha Bone!

61
00:07:46,826 --> 00:07:48,535
A Mecha Bone, koron!

62
00:07:51,248 --> 00:07:53,704
I don't think so!

63
00:07:58,771 --> 00:07:59,782
Nice catch!

64
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,868
Chef Kandagawa Toshiro Attack!

65
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:04,729
Alright!

66
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:23,940
Hurray!

67
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,321
Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!

68
00:08:27,321 --> 00:08:31,348
We've... we've won!

69
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:43,952
Er, Mistress Doronjo, that's...

70
00:08:43,952 --> 00:08:46,000
The self-destruct button.

71
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:55,048
No way!

72
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,243
Are you alright?

73
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,203
Ah, geez! That Yatterman!

74
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:48,251
They never give up!

75
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:50,977
Maybe we should make a simpler, stronger mecha...

76
00:09:50,977 --> 00:09:53,944
We can't let this get us down!

77
00:09:53,944 --> 00:09:56,222
How frustrating!

78
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:02,473
<i>So you failed again.</i>

79
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:07,956
<i>I am Dokurobe, the god of thieves!</i>

80
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:12,714
<i>How long will it take for you to get the Skull Stone?</i>

81
00:10:12,714 --> 00:10:13,590
About that...

82
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:16,501
It's all Boyacky's fault!

83
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:17,805
Not me, Boyacky!

84
00:10:17,805 --> 00:10:20,026
What are you saying, Mistress Doronjo?!

85
00:10:20,026 --> 00:10:22,859
It's a queen's nature to push the blame to someone else.

86
00:10:22,859 --> 00:10:25,841
Just take it. Just take it, Boyayan!

87
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:28,247
<i>I don't want to hear excuses.</i>

88
00:10:28,247 --> 00:10:30,842
<i>You will be punished!</i>

89
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:46,383
<i>Allow me to explain!</i>

90
00:10:46,383 --> 00:10:48,408
<i>The Skull Stone</i>

91
00:10:48,408 --> 00:10:51,158
<i>is a legendary stone that has appeared in a number of writings</i>

92
00:10:51,158 --> 00:10:52,847
<i>since ancient times.</i>

93
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:56,643
<i>It was broken into four pieces,</i>

94
00:10:56,643 --> 00:10:58,503
<i>which were scattered throughout the world.</i>

95
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:02,145
<i>However, if those four stones should come together again,</i>

96
00:11:02,145 --> 00:11:04,589
<i>it is said that a miracle will occur.</i>

97
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:08,039
<i>A forest in Narway</i>

98
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,530
<i>And recently,</i>

99
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,817
<i>an archaeologist that has been devoted to researching the Skull Stones,</i>

100
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:18,242
<i>Doctor Kaieda, has discovered two of the pieces.</i>

101
00:11:19,027 --> 00:11:20,744
This makes two.

102
00:11:30,182 --> 00:11:31,482
Who's there?

103
00:11:35,187 --> 00:11:37,698
I'm not a bad guy.

104
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:43,445
I'm a Japanese archaeologist.

105
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:47,924
That stone is not meant for human hands.

106
00:11:50,588 --> 00:11:51,580
Who are you?

107
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:55,440
I am a god.

108
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:59,068
Where is the first stone?

109
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:00,471
I'll never tell you!

110
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:05,377
I'll take them both!

111
00:12:30,036 --> 00:12:31,871
<i>And so, Dokurobe,</i>

112
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,629
<i>who kind of cunningly called himself "the god of thieves",</i>

113
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:38,383
<i>somehow or other was able to obtain one of the four stones.</i>

114
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:42,451
<i>And, using Doronjo and her Doronbo gang,</i>

115
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:47,104
<i>he searches for the remaining Skull Stones.</i>

116
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:08,124
<i>This is the Takada Toy Store.</i>

117
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:13,805
<i>And underground lies Yatterman's secret headquarters.</i>

118
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:40,688
<i>He is Yatterman #1, Takada Gan.</i>

119
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,177
<i>Yatterman #1</i>

120
00:13:44,612 --> 00:13:46,759
<i>He specializes in tinkering with mecha.</i>

121
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:51,996
<i>She is Yatterman #2, Kaminari Ai.</i>

122
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,653
<i>Yatterman #2</i>

123
00:13:56,097 --> 00:13:59,351
<i>This little guy is Omochama, one of Gan's creations.</i>

124
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:02,315
<i>He only takes two AA batteries!</i>

125
00:14:08,128 --> 00:14:11,465
<i>Gan is the only son of this toy store.</i>

126
00:14:11,465 --> 00:14:16,718
<i>His father is busy with toy sales overseas, and is away for a long business trip.</i>

127
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:23,450
<i>Gan took up his father's unfinished project, Yatterwan, and completed it.</i>

128
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:29,303
<i>Ai is Gan's girlfriend and the only daughter of Kaminari Electronics.</i>

129
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:31,805
<i>To defeat the Doronbo gang,</i>

130
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:35,735
<i>these two transform into Yatterman and fight once a week.</i>

131
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:41,519
<i>And this girl is Kaieda Shoko.</i>

132
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:47,539
<i>She is the only daughter of the archaeologist, Dr. Kaieda, who was attacked by Dokurobe.</i>

133
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:53,324
So that's the Skull Stone?

134
00:14:55,564 --> 00:14:57,755
My father told me to keep it.

135
00:14:58,969 --> 00:15:03,133
He said he thought he was close to finding the second one, and that he was going to look for it.

136
00:15:03,773 --> 00:15:05,725
But he hasn't come home.

137
00:15:07,271 --> 00:15:11,280
So Doronjo and the others targeted you because of that stone.

138
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,282
What about your mother?

139
00:15:14,611 --> 00:15:15,710
I don't have one.

140
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,862
My mother died right after I was born.

141
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:26,076
Since then, it's just been my father and me.

142
00:15:38,307 --> 00:15:39,655
By the way,

143
00:15:42,147 --> 00:15:43,546
what's a Skull Stone?

144
00:15:47,982 --> 00:15:49,206
You don't know?

145
00:15:49,206 --> 00:15:52,168
You fought with them even though you didn't know, koron?

146
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:52,958
What is it?

147
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:53,454
How embarrassing.

148
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:54,381
Hey!

149
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:58,758
Huh?! Everyone knew about it?!

150
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,496
I want to see him!

151
00:16:01,884 --> 00:16:03,284
My father.

152
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:09,706
I'm all alone...

153
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:18,061
I'm so lonely.

154
00:16:20,357 --> 00:16:25,435
Will you help me look for my father?

155
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:39,808
Let's go, woof!

156
00:16:45,777 --> 00:16:46,724
Hey.

157
00:16:47,284 --> 00:16:49,850
When's the next Pikopiko Runrun meeting?

158
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,503
The Pikopiko Runrun meeting is on Tuesday.

159
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:54,418
- Tuesday?
- Yeah.

160
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:56,564
Eh? Hey.

161
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:58,765
It's not here! It disappeared.

162
00:17:00,924 --> 00:17:02,614
Seriously, Tuesday's gone.

163
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:05,390
Mine's gone, too.

164
00:17:07,202 --> 00:17:08,618
Lucky...

165
00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:09,988
<i>Breaking news.</i>

166
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:14,783
<i>Now, all across the country, we are receiving reports that various things are disappearing.</i>

167
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:18,426
<i>For example, money from banks has vanished, or-</i>

168
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:32,960
Ladies and gentlemen,

169
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,103
welcome to Merry Doro!

170
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:38,776
Everybody, do you want to be happy?

171
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:41,790
Yeah!

172
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:47,699
Now, in Merry Doro, we have the world's most expensive wedding dress

173
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:52,442
that would normally go for well above 1,000,000 yen for only

174
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,924
100,000 yen!

175
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,204
Only

176
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:02,090
100,000 yen!

177
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,870
ONLY

178
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,299
100,000 yen!

179
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:10,697
Happiness is

180
00:18:10,697 --> 00:18:13,010
100,000 yen!

181
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,906
How inexpensive!

182
00:18:14,906 --> 00:18:17,535
Excuse me, is it really only 100,000 yen?

183
00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:18,676
It really is.

184
00:18:18,676 --> 00:18:22,609
Um, we've both been divorced
once.

185
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:24,522
Are there age restrictions?

186
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:27,053
No.

187
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:27,977
Really?

188
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:29,764
Is it really true?

189
00:18:29,764 --> 00:18:31,378
You're persistent.

190
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:35,505
So, you,

191
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:38,236
and you, and you

192
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,803
can become this beautiful for just 100,000 yen!

193
00:18:54,465 --> 00:18:59,381
Everyone, you can have a beautiful dress like this for only 100,000 yen!

194
00:18:59,381 --> 00:19:01,820
You can have your pick!

195
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:06,990
How beautiful...

196
00:19:07,686 --> 00:19:10,219
Boyayan, this is work, got it? Work!

197
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:14,155
What do you think?

198
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:16,752
We're gonna be rolling in cash!

199
00:19:16,752 --> 00:19:18,668
Okay!

200
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:23,454
- I'll take one!
- Me, too!

201
00:19:23,802 --> 00:19:24,947
Please!

202
00:19:24,947 --> 00:19:27,234
I'll buy! Please!

203
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:28,954
Thank you, come again!

204
00:19:29,465 --> 00:19:32,865
Alright alright!

205
00:19:33,818 --> 00:19:36,627
Merry Doro, huh?

206
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:43,510
Could it possibly be possible, koron?

207
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,774
Alright, congratulations! Congratulations!

208
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,104

We used all the money we got to build this new mecha.

244
00:23:03,123 --> 00:23:07,103
We call it Virgin Roader.

245
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:13,186
A creation inspired by the image of Mistress Doronjo as a bride.

246
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:16,829
Love comes before marriage, you know.

Love...

Yes. Then I, though unworthy, shall take my partner in glorious love...

Come, Boyacky.

I won't let you get away for free.

But of course, Mistress Doronjo!

00:24:00,756 --> 00:24:04,575
It will definitely, well, maybe be okay, I think.

Yes.

255

Yes.

Yes, master!

259
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:41,902
Have you discovered the locations of the Skull Stones?

Mistress Doronjo.

261

If all the Skull Stones are collected, a miracle occurs.

262
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,528
If we get them, our dreams can come true.

263
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:56,713
Dreams come true?

264
00:24:56,713 --> 00:24:57,704
Dreams?

265
00:25:03,046 --> 00:25:06,094
All the high school girls in the country.

Dream?

274
00:26:20,132 --> 00:26:21,959
It's almost time, isn't it?

275
00:26:23,051 --> 00:26:25,423
It'd be great if it's a boy.

276
00:26:25,736 --> 00:26:26,920
Yes.

277

278
00:26:41,189 --> 00:26:43,496
I want it!

279
00:26:43,496 --> 00:26:45,596
Now's not the time for fantasizing!

280
00:26:45,596 --> 00:26:46,954
Yes, master!

281
00:26:46,954 --> 00:26:52,500
The girl you let get away is the daughter of the archaeologist.

282
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,077
She definitely has the first piece.

283
00:26:56,077 --> 00:27:03,180
But for now, for your next mission, you need to hurry to Ogypt.

284

The third Skull Stone is in Ogypt?

285
00:27:06,857 --> 00:27:09,368
Doronjo.

286

00:31:07,896 --> 00:31:11,721
<i>He's at your service (oh)
Yatterman</i>

334
00:31:11,721 --> 00:31:18,605
<i>With his tiny robots at his side</i>

335
00:31:18,605 --> 00:31:25,653
<i>He'll kick the Doronbo gang</i>

336
00:31:25,653 --> 00:31:27,302
<i>He digs right in</i>

337
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,179
<i>His legs jingle</i>

338
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,025
<i>In a pose of victory</i>

339
00:31:30,025 --> 00:31:31,843
Father!

340
00:31:31,843 --> 00:31:32,921
<i>Yeah! Acho!</i>

341
00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:39,744
<i>He's mysteriously strong</i>

342
00:31:39,744 --> 00:31:41,824
<i>Yatta! Yatta! Yatta! Yatta!</i>

343
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,387
<i>Ogypt</i>

344
00:31:43,387 --> 00:31:46,262
<i>Yatterman</i>

345
00:32:02,157 --> 00:32:03,905
Spooky, koron.

346
00:32:13,263 --> 00:32:15,374
- Shoko?
- What's wrong?

347
00:32:15,374 --> 00:32:16,779
Is she okay, koron?

348
00:32:16,984 --> 00:32:18,411
Something bit me!

349
00:32:18,411 --> 00:32:19,334
What?

350
00:32:22,976 --> 00:32:24,135
A scorpion.

351
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,690
You jerk!

352
00:32:31,347 --> 00:32:32,640
Where did it sting you?

353
00:32:33,093 --> 00:32:34,160
Here.

354
00:32:38,227 --> 00:32:39,438
Out of the way!

355
00:32:46,747 --> 00:32:48,380
Wait a sec, #1!

356
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,810
Get off!

357
00:33:07,562 --> 00:33:08,694
Okay.

358
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:13,578
I sucked out all the poison, so you should be fine.

359
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:15,713
Thank you.

360
00:33:19,227 --> 00:33:22,969
What if my father was stung by a scorpion, and the poison...

361
00:33:24,575 --> 00:33:26,445
Dr. Kaieda isn't dead.

362
00:33:28,098 --> 00:33:30,063
You don't know that!

363
00:33:31,404 --> 00:33:33,018
Why are you so sure?

364
00:33:33,018 --> 00:33:36,850
He can't be dead! Dr. Kaieda is alive.

365
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,262
That's what I believe.

366
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:59,191
Wow, this is amazing, koron!

367
00:34:13,142 --> 00:34:14,524
Could it be...

368
00:34:14,524 --> 00:34:16,382
A Skull Stone?

369
00:34:21,499 --> 00:34:24,272
We actually found it pretty easily, koron.

370
00:34:40,786 --> 00:34:42,140
What is that?

371
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,060
<i>Virgin Roader!</i>

372
00:34:54,778 --> 00:34:57,088
Thanks for finding it for us.

373
00:34:57,088 --> 00:34:58,313
Doronbo!

374
00:34:58,802 --> 00:35:00,837
We'll take that Skull Stone.

375
00:35:01,669 --> 00:35:05,437
Boyacky! Tonzra! Get them!

376
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,988
Yes, Mistress!

377
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:12,414
Check this out.

378
00:35:28,722 --> 00:35:29,908
Let me guess.

379
00:35:29,908 --> 00:35:31,070
Kendamagic!

380
00:35:37,807 --> 00:35:39,706
No!

381
00:35:41,018 --> 00:35:43,673
What did you do to Boyayan?!

382
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:47,815
Take my bouquet bomb!

383
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:50,745
Amen.

384
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:22,099
Uncle! Uncle uncle uncle!

385
00:36:31,712 --> 00:36:32,945
We've got it!

386
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,962
You thief!

387
00:36:35,962 --> 00:36:36,963
Yatterwan!

388
00:36:40,758 --> 00:36:41,946
Catch, woof!

389
00:36:43,503 --> 00:36:46,361
Leave this to me, Mistress Doronjo!

390
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,505
I've got something special today!

391
00:36:50,171 --> 00:36:51,851
<i>Ooh!</i>

392
00:37:17,749 --> 00:37:19,314
What is that?

393
00:37:19,314 --> 00:37:22,196
Mistress Doronjo.

394
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,211
I present to you the Virgin Road.

395
00:37:27,459 --> 00:37:32,017
Hoping for your happiness, I made this for you, Mistress Doronjo.

396
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,445
You did?

397
00:38:05,234 --> 00:38:07,106
Wh-who is it?

398
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:27,111
This took three months of my salary.

399
00:38:27,111 --> 00:38:29,364
You perv!

400
00:38:30,486 --> 00:38:32,594
Now's not the time for that!

401
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,077
Virgin Roader, attack!

402
00:38:35,077 --> 00:38:36,959
Yes, Mistress!

403
00:38:43,796 --> 00:38:50,101
I'm coming!

404
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,508
Yatterwan, we're counting on you!

405
00:38:56,478 --> 00:38:59,434
Let's start off with the Boob Machine Guns!

406
00:38:59,434 --> 00:39:01,546
Ready, here we go!

407
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:06,331
Yes!

408
00:39:14,704 --> 00:39:15,770
Oh crap!

409
00:39:31,523 --> 00:39:32,650
Look out, koron!

410
00:39:44,025 --> 00:39:45,475
Yatterwan!

411
00:39:53,301 --> 00:39:56,682
Next, it's the Boob Missiles!

412
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,768
Do it!

413
00:40:16,197 --> 00:40:17,520
Mr. Yatterwan!

414
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,321
Yatterwan!

415
00:40:26,505 --> 00:40:29,388
Yatterwan! A Mecha Bone!

416
00:40:45,172 --> 00:40:46,589
<i>Allow me to explain!</i>

417
00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:48,593
<i>A Mecha Bone is like a battery</i>

418
00:40:48,593 --> 00:40:52,843
<i>that gives Yatterwan energy to produce mini-mechas!</i>

419
00:40:59,259 --> 00:41:00,975
It worked!

420
00:41:13,657 --> 00:41:17,519
Here comes this week's surprise mini-mecha!

421
00:41:30,272 --> 00:41:31,844
Oh no.

422
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:39,613
Ant, ant, ant, ant...

423
00:41:39,613 --> 00:41:42,684
Huh? What are those?

424
00:41:42,684 --> 00:41:48,793
Ant, ant, ant, ant...

425
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,080
Ant!

426
00:42:13,186 --> 00:42:15,536
Ant, ant!

427
00:42:23,379 --> 00:42:25,158
Ant!

428
00:42:37,813 --> 00:42:39,063
Yes!

429
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:45,692
Yatterwan?

430
00:42:48,074 --> 00:42:49,920
That's hot, that's hot...

431
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,135
Yes!

432
00:42:56,527 --> 00:43:00,756
Boyacky, we're in trouble!
Run away! Escape!

433
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,434
Escape button!

434
00:43:05,434 --> 00:43:07,701
Ready, here we go!

435
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,728
Aahh! I can't push it!

436
00:43:12,906 --> 00:43:17,039
Oh, oh, yes! Yes!

437
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:19,803
I can't stand it any longer, woof!

438
00:43:20,778 --> 00:43:25,625
Oh, yes!
I'm coming!

439
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,488
Love!

440
00:43:44,522 --> 00:43:46,529
Calm down, Yatterwan!

441
00:43:55,439 --> 00:43:57,392
What do you two think you're doing?!

442
00:44:07,042 --> 00:44:11,305
Mr. Yatterwan!

443
00:44:17,418 --> 00:44:20,105
I'm coming!

444
00:44:56,266 --> 00:44:57,859
Yatterwan...

445
00:45:02,921 --> 00:45:04,474
It's not safe, let's get outta here!

446
00:45:04,474 --> 00:45:05,580
This way, koron!

447
00:45:06,735 --> 00:45:07,862
Wait right there!

448
00:45:11,362 --> 00:45:13,505
Give me the Skull Stone!

449
00:45:13,505 --> 00:45:15,694
This belongs to her.

450
00:45:15,694 --> 00:45:17,633
We won't give it to you!

451
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:25,727
Mistress Doronjo!

452
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,195
Boyacky!

453
00:45:33,883 --> 00:45:37,496
Boyayan! Hang in there!

454
00:45:37,496 --> 00:45:39,151
Hol- I don't think it's gonna...

455
00:45:39,151 --> 00:45:41,385
I don't think this will work, wait, I don't...

456
00:45:51,028 --> 00:45:53,363
Mistress Doronjo, are you hurt?

457
00:46:01,012 --> 00:46:02,296
What?

458
00:46:05,077 --> 00:46:06,539
He's naked, koron.

459
00:46:15,237 --> 00:46:20,063
Mistress Doronjo, I can't escape like this!

460
00:46:20,063 --> 00:46:22,975
Leave me and save yourself!

461
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,816
What are you saying?!

462
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,911
Boyayan, we can forget about your shame!

463
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:34,407
We don't care how much we see of you!

464
00:46:37,937 --> 00:46:39,807
You can live.

465
00:46:40,395 --> 00:46:43,272
You can live, Boyayan!

466
00:46:56,149 --> 00:46:57,667
Oh no, oink!

467
00:47:02,214 --> 00:47:03,666
Boyayan!

468
00:47:06,633 --> 00:47:08,825
Live!

469
00:47:12,694 --> 00:47:15,311
How touching, oink!
How touching, oink!

470
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:16,918
Oink!

471
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:18,190
Perv!

472
00:47:18,658 --> 00:47:19,739
Oink!

473
00:47:25,881 --> 00:47:26,767
Kendamagic!

474
00:47:59,302 --> 00:48:01,277
<i>This doesn't mean I saved you.</i>

475
00:48:02,058 --> 00:48:04,618
<i>I just don't want</i>

476
00:48:04,977 --> 00:48:06,539
<i>to win this way.</i>

477
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:04,266
Let's go.

478
00:49:29,514 --> 00:49:35,561
My throat is so dry...

479
00:49:43,401 --> 00:49:45,251
<i>You idiots!</i>

480
00:49:46,374 --> 00:49:50,487
<i>Why didn't you leave the girl</i>

481
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:55,002
<i>and steal the Skull Stone?! You stupidfaces!</i>

482
00:49:55,002 --> 00:49:56,201
Yes, master!

483
00:49:56,727 --> 00:50:00,045
<i>You're so thirsty that you can't talk?</i>

484
00:50:00,045 --> 00:50:03,533
<i>Drink this.</i>

485
00:50:18,068 --> 00:50:19,439
It's water.

486
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:25,801
What was that sound?

487
00:50:28,773 --> 00:50:30,050
What's this?

488
00:50:33,466 --> 00:50:34,907
What?

489
00:50:43,531 --> 00:50:47,029
<i>I'm not that naive!</i>

490
00:50:47,029 --> 00:50:51,046
<i>That cap is the switch for your punishment!</i>

491
00:51:00,108 --> 00:51:04,433
<i>It's your punishment!</i>

492
00:51:40,172 --> 00:51:41,461
Um...

493
00:51:44,146 --> 00:51:47,464
What does a kiss feel like?

494
00:51:50,144 --> 00:51:52,115
It's nothing special.

495
00:51:52,115 --> 00:51:54,901
You only get excited the first time.

496
00:51:54,901 --> 00:51:56,865
Is that so?

497
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:01,540
You'd know if you did it once.

498
00:52:07,011 --> 00:52:09,479
It's nothing for Taka to kiss someone.

499
00:53:03,286 --> 00:53:04,558
Those jerks...

500
00:53:05,336 --> 00:53:07,285
Yatterman!

501
00:53:08,884 --> 00:53:12,885
Especially #1!

502
00:53:22,837 --> 00:53:24,173
Boyayan.

503
00:53:25,818 --> 00:53:27,356
Hang in there.

504
00:54:57,832 --> 00:54:58,993
Boyayan!

505
00:55:02,501 --> 00:55:03,716
Mistress Doronjo!

506
00:55:06,592 --> 00:55:09,181
Don't just barge in here, you per...

507
00:55:09,984 --> 00:55:15,467
I am Dokurobe!

508
00:55:15,467 --> 00:55:20,998
Heed my words!

509
00:55:20,998 --> 00:55:31,821
I've got more orders for you.

510
00:55:31,821 --> 00:55:34,438
Thank you, Master!

511
00:55:34,438 --> 00:55:38,731
It's almost time for our final battle.

512
00:55:38,731 --> 00:55:41,392
I have information that the final Skull Stone

513
00:55:41,392 --> 00:55:45,651
lies deep within the mountains of the Southern Halps.

514
00:55:46,139 --> 00:55:48,816
You must get it!

515
00:55:48,816 --> 00:55:51,272
And also, Doronjo.

516
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:56,927
Don't mix love and work.

517
00:55:59,083 --> 00:56:00,175
Love?

518
00:56:02,247 --> 00:56:03,984
It's for your own good.

519
00:56:03,984 --> 00:56:07,558
You have to forget about that man.

520
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:10,721
Thieves aren't allowed to fall in love?

521
00:56:16,365 --> 00:56:17,099
Boyayan!

522
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:19,758
Are you going against me, Doronjo?

523
00:56:20,359 --> 00:56:21,433
No.

524
00:56:22,923 --> 00:56:24,333
But...

525
00:56:27,116 --> 00:56:29,290
It's my first love.

526
00:56:31,331 --> 00:56:35,778
Then your punishment will be small.

527
00:56:53,469 --> 00:57:00,266
Doronjo. You belong to me.

528
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:08,029
You belong to me.

529
00:57:08,029 --> 00:57:12,919
You belong to me.
