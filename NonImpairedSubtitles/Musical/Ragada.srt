1
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,948
Do you believe in God?
- l do.

2
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:31,686
When faced with death,
anyone would develop belief in God.

3
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:40,862
Do you know all humans have
a small dent on the upper lip?

4
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:42,528
Touch and feel it.

5
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:47,700
Have it?
Do you know why do we've it?

6
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:49,709
There's a small story behind it.

7
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:55,915
Brahma, the creator,
when he first created man,

8
00:03:56,086 --> 00:03:57,883
it seems man knew everything,

9
00:03:58,055 --> 00:04:00,489
he knew what the other man's
thoughts in his mind,

10
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:03,057
he knew what would happen in future,

11
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:07,322
he knew when one would die and
when one would take birth,

12
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:11,491
he knew everything, why would man
who knows everything keep quiet?

13
00:04:11,702 --> 00:04:17,402
He thought he's equal to God
and started to fight God.

14
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:21,738
Man lost peace of mind and God too!

15
00:04:21,912 --> 00:04:28,249
God came to know then that man who
knows everything will be in trouble,

16
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:32,411
Then God placed his finger
on the mouth of man.

17
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:37,422
To keep shut!
That's this dent!

18
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:39,494
There's a moral in it!

19
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:44,924
Too much of knowledge is useless!

20
00:04:45,102 --> 00:04:47,093
You've gained too much knowledge.

21
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:53,140
l killed someone.
l did it right before your office.

22
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,710
Your bad luck you saw it happen.

23
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,541
lmmediately called police
and informed it's me.

24
00:04:58,749 --> 00:05:00,444
How could you recognize me?

25
00:05:00,617 --> 00:05:04,246
You'd have seen my photo
in newspaper or on TV.

26
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:06,446
lmmediately you put your
knowledge on display.

27
00:05:06,623 --> 00:05:10,491
Sir, l made a mistake sir,
please spare me.

28
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:15,724
When man had too much knowledge,
because he's God, he stopped with a seal,

29
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,801
but the seal is done here with this.

30
00:05:37,888 --> 00:05:43,087
Devudanna! Do you know with
whom you picked up fight? peddanna!

31
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,026
You know peddanna is searching for Nanda,

32
00:05:48,198 --> 00:05:50,189
but still you gave him shelter,

33
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:52,767
and helped him to escape,

34
00:05:53,003 --> 00:05:55,164
and made peddanna furious.

35
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:02,276
Who is your favourite God?
- Sai Baba!

36
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:05,347
But peddanna saved your life today.

37
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:08,211
Say hail peddanna and go away.

38
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:12,845
Hail peddanna! Hail peddanna!

39
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:46,882
Where are you from brother?

40
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:48,882
Where are you heading brother?

41
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:51,926
What for brother?

42
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:09,411
Didn't it burn your finger, brother?
- lt did.

43
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:11,137
What's the trick then?

44
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:14,083
Enduring pain is the trick.

45
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:17,414
Man who knows that trick
can achieve anything.

46
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:35,434
Hey clear out!

47
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:36,864
Greetings brother!

48
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,265
How are you Naik? Fine?

49
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:41,569
l'm fine, please sit down brother.
l was waiting for you.

50
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,771
Boys, look after brother very well.
Go boys!

51
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:56,451
Come on boys!

52
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,135
Cover him!

53
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:13,873
Stop the lorry.
- There's a clash going on, brother.

54
00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:15,011
That's why l told you to stop.

55
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:17,078
l don't like to stay in
peaceful surroundings.

56
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,340
l think he's a dangerous man, brother.

57
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,056
Tell me Goverdhan.

58
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:05,956
Madam, GK brother has been attacked.
- But still he survived, right?

59
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:06,959
How do you know it madam?

60
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,792
lf anything had happened to GK,
you would've started with cry.

61
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,697
Madam, you've great brain.
- No use of having just brain.

62
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,771
No man would marry a brainy girl.
You come to the matter.

63
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,304
Tomorrow is GK brother's
birthday, right madam?

64
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,069
We went to Srisailam and on the way back
we stopped at a roadside dhaba,

65
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:23,735
they attacked us there,
all of us would be dead by now,

66
00:09:23,914 --> 00:09:29,045
a man from nowhere came and
started the counter attack...

67
00:09:56,813 --> 00:10:00,613
Kadapa! lf things are fine,
it's sugarcane,

68
00:10:00,784 --> 00:10:02,445
if you go against, it's fight!

69
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,598
Someone is hitting our boys.

70
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:41,947
One tea please!
- Now?

71
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,468
The man had a different style.

72
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,967
He had inbuilt heroism in him, madam.

73
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:56,969
ls he handsome?
- Why are you asking that madam?

74
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,233
lt's rare to get handsome heroes nowadays.

75
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,845
Handsome, he's like Adonis with mass image,

76
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:05,481
infact girls swoon on his moustache, madam,.

77
00:11:05,648 --> 00:11:07,411
Where is he now?
- He's gone, madam.

78
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:09,618
You cut the line.

79
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:21,492
Greetings madam...

80
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:23,165
Greetings.

81
00:11:28,038 --> 00:11:29,005
Greetings madam.

82
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:34,241
You're fine, aren't you?

83
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:37,869
Do you know how tensed l was
hearing about the attack on you, GK?

84
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:41,016
l'm not bothered about the
attack on me, Shirisha.

85
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:44,551
l'm happy today for seeing a real Don.

86
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:01,533
Run out of bullets!
- Yes.

87
00:12:37,574 --> 00:12:41,135
Not his fight but the way
beat impressed me a lot.

88
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:43,905
Coolness is in his blood.

89
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,608
When someone is so good,
anyone would be so cool.

90
00:12:48,785 --> 00:12:52,084
Man's real character comes out
only in dangerous situations.

91
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:53,620
Who attacked you?

92
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,917
Who else other than Bhagawan's gang?

93
00:12:56,092 --> 00:12:58,720
l thought we got a good chance
of eliminating GK,

94
00:12:58,895 --> 00:12:59,884
how could you miss him?

95
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,257
A stranger saved him, brother.

96
00:13:01,431 --> 00:13:03,661
Who is he?
- We don't know.

97
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,269
We started it but he finished it.

98
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,276
Hey, where's my tea?
- lt's there, take it yourself.

99
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,269
Bloody!

100
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:22,943
Won't you let me have tea?

101
00:13:58,021 --> 00:13:59,921
What? Are you the gang leader?

102
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:07,821
Great!

103
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,325
Got beaten up by him and
yet singing his paeans.

104
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,665
What am l to tell brother Bhagawan?

105
00:14:16,573 --> 00:14:17,562
Brother...
- Go ahead.

106
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,642
l finished peddanna's job
but GK managed to escape.

107
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:23,278
How is father?

108
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,083
Sir...
- What sir?

109
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,055
Didn't l get it? What's there
in it not to understand?

110
00:14:38,261 --> 00:14:42,197
Reports...cancer...confirmed.

111
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,199
Have you come son?

112
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:48,632
This English doctor too has confirmed it.
lt's cancer.

113
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,069
That's okay, have you eliminated GK?

114
00:14:51,241 --> 00:14:53,471
Tell him cost doesn't matter
but he must get well.

115
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:58,080
What can he do?
Cancer means death.

116
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:01,648
That's okay, did you kill GK or not?

117
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,251
No, we missed him.

118
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:08,755
We need such skillful man in our side
to confront Bhagawan.

119
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:12,224
Skillful men aren't humble.
Be careful.

120
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:14,886
He isn't humble,

121
00:15:15,598 --> 00:15:18,999
l invited him to the party tomorrow,
do you know his reply?

122
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:22,229
l'll come if l've mood.

123
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,831
l want him at any cost.

124
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,409
Find him!

125
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:47,263
Adonis! Real man!

126
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,514
Adonis with moustache...
dashing debonair...

127
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:15,624
Let you rock the world, suave man...

128
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:28,964
You're rocking my heart to move...

129
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:33,199
You're ravaging my world of beauty...

130
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,969
This young girl is seeking you
to rock her...

131
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:39,979
Have a blast with me...

132
00:16:40,183 --> 00:16:45,086
Hey listen! My name is rock...

133
00:16:48,658 --> 00:16:51,650
Challenge is my style...

134
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:57,830
lf anyone dares stop me,
it's a war...

135
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:02,496
lf anyone challenges me,
it's a fight...

136
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:15,349
Your daring attitude is playing
games with thunders...

137
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:49,608
lf you think it's impossible,
you can't achieve anything...

138
00:17:49,786 --> 00:17:55,383
Make dare your attitude and
take head on any challenge...

139
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:00,627
lf you're scared,
you'll remain always behind...

140
00:18:00,797 --> 00:18:06,599
lf you dare to swim against the tide,
victory will be yours always...

141
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:10,899
Your manliness has taken possession
over my body and mind...

142
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:15,203
You've taken over me like the
fragrant smell of spices...

143
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,778
Your fiery eyes have lit
fire of passion in my heart...

144
00:18:17,947 --> 00:18:20,745
lt's pushing my lips to fight
with your lips...

145
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:14,496
You're the worker and
you're the boss always...

146
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:20,302
Always be on top of the world
like Sun in the sky...

147
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:25,577
lf dark clouds hover,
chase it out like a wind storm...

148
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:30,481
lf you've brain and sharpness,
even will fate will bow to you...

149
00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:35,655
You're the awakening in sleep,
you're rocking lightning while awake...

150
00:19:35,825 --> 00:19:40,091
You're the hot passion
that's instigating my youth...

151
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:42,823
A bat of your eye is enough
to give me chill of love...

152
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:45,661
When will you take me...

153
00:20:15,831 --> 00:20:17,526
Why is the egg like this?

154
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,563
l didn't lay the egg, hen laid it.
Eat!

155
00:20:19,735 --> 00:20:21,259
Who the hell is he?

156
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:21,995
l had ordered fried rice an hour ago,
what happened to it?

157
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:25,004
My cook has gone to watch matinee show,
he'll come back and cook.

158
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:26,937
Sit here till then.
- My fate.

159
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:28,667
Why this table is so dirty?

160
00:20:28,844 --> 00:20:31,870
Are you here to eat table?
Why are you bothered about it? Drink!

161
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,142
The voice seems familiar.

162
00:20:46,228 --> 00:20:49,755
Brother, there's a hole in the heart.

163
00:20:49,932 --> 00:20:54,062
Need lakhs for operation,
this rich man wants to help.

164
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:59,902
lf you stand surety for me,
heart's hole will be filled.

165
00:21:00,977 --> 00:21:04,572
The more you delay,
the fiercer you'll get beaten up.

166
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:06,571
l'm here, brother!

167
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,748
l want to beat you black and
blue with this hand.

168
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,344
To do that l need to touch you.
l don't like it.

169
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:14,751
Thanks brother.

170
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:20,989
Didn't you beat me now, brother?

171
00:21:21,163 --> 00:21:25,156
Why are you rushing? Now that l'm here,
you'll get beaten up regularly.

172
00:21:25,334 --> 00:21:26,062
Where's the money?

173
00:21:26,235 --> 00:21:28,760
Money? Brother, what had happened was...

174
00:21:28,938 --> 00:21:33,705
l came to Hyderabad to business with
all the money swindled from there,

175
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,037
real estate is down and
lpL betting is hot business now,

176
00:21:37,246 --> 00:21:41,205
so, we bought a house and few
rogues like me joined to do business,

177
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:47,687
but they beat and threw me out for
cheating them just Rs.50000 only, brother.

178
00:21:47,857 --> 00:21:49,324
l lost everything and
ended up as server.

179
00:21:49,492 --> 00:21:52,825
Show me the house.
- lf l show you, will you beat them?

180
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:56,624
They're not ordinary goons but
real bad guys, toughies.

181
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:19,053
This house is mine, if anyone dares
to enter without my appointment...

182
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:20,313
...you'll get knocked-out!

183
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:21,547
You too!

184
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,157
l had added myself too, brother.

185
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,651
Have you understood useless donkeys?

186
00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:29,525
Your force can't withstand
before his horsepower,

187
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:32,167
come back with some real men.

188
00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:55,183
You'll be out tomorrow,
unnecessarily tried to escape today.

189
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,342
Tomorrow? l didn't know that.

190
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,044
Okay, come.
- Come.

191
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:01,485
Don't tell anyone about this,

192
00:24:01,624 --> 00:24:04,889
may get suspended for
getting scared of a soap.

193
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,461
You must do one thing to
keep this a secret.- What?

194
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:10,656
Get me a new bar of soap,
l need to take a bath.

195
00:24:22,111 --> 00:24:24,272
Hey, brother is coming.

196
00:24:33,255 --> 00:24:34,381
Greetings brother.

197
00:24:36,158 --> 00:24:38,388
Garland is small and greeting too.

198
00:24:38,594 --> 00:24:40,960
l demand respect.
- You need money for it.

199
00:24:42,331 --> 00:24:45,459
l must meet GK.
- There's a party in brother GK's place.

200
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:48,797
Do you know why did l slap you?

201
00:24:49,205 --> 00:24:52,197
You addressed GK as brother.
- But he said that, brother.

202
00:24:52,374 --> 00:24:54,137
Shouldn't l beat you for it?

203
00:24:54,844 --> 00:24:57,904
GK is just a little kid.

204
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,810
l taught him to be a don
and extortionist.

205
00:25:00,983 --> 00:25:02,814
Do l've invitation for the party?

206
00:25:03,285 --> 00:25:05,048
You know l don't attend parties
without invitations.

207
00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:07,314
Yes brother.
- Take out a paper and pen.

208
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,150
To brother Brahmam,
invitation from GK,

209
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:14,555
brother, you must attend the
party today evening without fail,

210
00:25:14,697 --> 00:25:15,994
l beg you,

211
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:17,421
did you write it?

212
00:25:19,134 --> 00:25:20,829
l must attend when he says
l beg you, right?

213
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:34,345
Hey, tell GK that brother is here, go.

214
00:25:34,884 --> 00:25:37,182
Move away man! Go!

215
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,848
Hey Goverdhan!
Are your wife and kids fine?

216
00:25:42,024 --> 00:25:44,015
l mean your wife and my kids.

217
00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:47,292
What a parting shot!

218
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:50,694
He's GK's relative.
That's why tolerated his nonsense.

219
00:25:58,707 --> 00:26:01,198
l got the mood and so here l am!

220
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:05,237
Even if you didn't get the mood,
l wouldn't have left you.- ls it so?

221
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:11,181
l came here first but
GK didn't see me.

222
00:26:11,353 --> 00:26:12,479
But he saw him.

223
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,089
Brother, you're little short,
so he might've missed seeing you.

224
00:26:15,257 --> 00:26:20,251
lf you call me Shorty,
l'll lynch and pack you in basket.

225
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:26,897
You needn't work under me,
you can work with me, brother.

226
00:26:27,136 --> 00:26:28,262
Listen to me.

227
00:26:29,905 --> 00:26:32,396
l'll listen to money only.

228
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:37,039
You'll get your percentage
in every deal we do.

229
00:26:37,212 --> 00:26:39,908
The more riskier the deal,
the percent will go up.

230
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:43,643
lf you're with me, we'll be
second to peddanna in this city.

231
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:46,619
We'll be kings.
- There will be only one king.

232
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:48,984
There's no second king after him.

233
00:26:49,158 --> 00:26:50,352
Everyone is subject, that's all.

234
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:56,431
You're right brother, nobody can take
on peddanna and live in this city.

235
00:26:57,466 --> 00:27:02,597
l'm lenient on Bhagawan because
peddanna is behind him.

236
00:27:02,771 --> 00:27:06,400
lf we take on Bhagawan, it means
inviting trouble from peddanna.

237
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,169
peddanna has 20 year history,

238
00:27:09,345 --> 00:27:12,280
he came into limelight
with Sanathnagar murders,

239
00:27:16,318 --> 00:27:19,116
later on he developed a large
of army of henchmen,

240
00:27:20,823 --> 00:27:24,281
among them Nanda, Bhagawan
and Jairam are famous,

241
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:28,288
after real estate hit low,
peddanna turned to politics,

242
00:27:32,034 --> 00:27:35,197
for public image of
shunning violent life,

243
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:37,464
he distanced himself from
those three men,

244
00:27:40,376 --> 00:27:43,743
but he uses them to kill anyone
he wants to eliminate,

245
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:49,182
recently he came to know about
Nanda doing deals independently,

246
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:52,286
he tried to kill him
without any warning,

247
00:27:52,454 --> 00:27:55,981
Nanda is on run now,
what l'm trying to tell you finally is..

248
00:27:56,158 --> 00:27:57,147
Not yet over?

249
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:03,425
You invited me to party and narrated me
tales about peddanna and Nanda,

250
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,830
and raising your tension,
and trying to raise my tension,

251
00:28:07,002 --> 00:28:11,666
earning with tension like this and
shelling out everything for doctors,

252
00:28:12,374 --> 00:28:13,033
do we need this?

253
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:16,473
Not that brother,
to keep my face in this city,

254
00:28:16,645 --> 00:28:20,911
l must atleast kill Jairam,
but see peddanna doesn't react to it.

255
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,482
What should l do?
- Give me Rs.50 lakhs, l'll tell you.

256
00:28:23,652 --> 00:28:26,883
l'll give Rs.50 lakhs, okay l've given,
tell me what should i do?

257
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:28,683
First enjoy the party.

258
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:36,197
Why am l so handsome?
l'm jealous of my beauty.

259
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:39,026
lf they add Men's beauty
contest in Olympics,

260
00:28:40,035 --> 00:28:42,128
l'll surely win gold medal for lndia.

261
00:28:45,174 --> 00:28:46,573
Why are you so shocked?

262
00:28:46,742 --> 00:28:48,107
ls there anyone more handsome
than me in this party?

263
00:28:48,277 --> 00:28:49,710
Brother, look there!

264
00:28:53,615 --> 00:28:58,143
Of course he may be handsome,
is he more handsome than me?

265
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,413
Oh brother Brahmanna! Are you coming now?

266
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:02,181
Looks like jail food has
worked out well for you.

267
00:29:02,357 --> 00:29:04,052
Hey, serve a drink to brother.

268
00:29:04,226 --> 00:29:05,420
l demand respect.

269
00:29:05,594 --> 00:29:08,427
Brother is asking a new brand,
get him that.

270
00:29:08,597 --> 00:29:09,689
Come brother.

271
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:12,497
Stop!

272
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,893
My name is Brahmam.

273
00:29:15,204 --> 00:29:16,967
Why are you telling me this?

274
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,665
Anyone would tell his name
while introducing himself.

275
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:22,777
l don't want new friends,
already l've too many.

276
00:29:22,945 --> 00:29:24,845
l'll make you a friend
if anyone of them dies.

277
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,245
What? Should a man die to
become your friend?

278
00:29:33,555 --> 00:29:35,682
He laughed aloud, brother.
- You slap him then.

279
00:29:35,891 --> 00:29:38,724
Brother, madam is calling you.
She's upstairs.

280
00:29:38,894 --> 00:29:40,384
Who is this upstairs madam?

281
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:41,460
Lower your voice brother,

282
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:44,497
madam is brother GK's partner
parthasarathy's daughter,

283
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:46,930
he's no more, he up there.

284
00:29:47,336 --> 00:29:48,428
Up into the sky, brother.

285
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:52,205
Brother, GK wants to marry madam.

286
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,205
That's why he cares her with respect.

287
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,037
lt's better you too respect her, brother.

288
00:29:56,245 --> 00:29:57,974
This is just an advice,
you don't have to follow it.

289
00:29:58,147 --> 00:30:00,445
You go brother...go.

290
00:30:15,964 --> 00:30:18,762
You're not so handsome
as l had expected.

291
00:30:18,934 --> 00:30:22,199
That's why girls are after me.
- Why is that so?

292
00:30:22,371 --> 00:30:25,397
lf more handsome,
lesser chances of approachability.

293
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:32,537
l hate cigarettes and smokers.
- Then stay away from me.

294
00:30:32,714 --> 00:30:33,806
l don't like your manners.

295
00:30:33,982 --> 00:30:36,507
You don't like?
l myself don't like my manners.

296
00:30:36,685 --> 00:30:39,654
That's why l get drunk every night
and feel bad about it.

297
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,322
Where are you from?
- Kadapa.

298
00:30:47,696 --> 00:30:49,596
You don't appear like a man from Seema.

299
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:54,759
Every man from Seema isn't country
and every city man isn't smart.

300
00:30:55,037 --> 00:30:56,436
Why didn't you come to the city then?

301
00:30:56,605 --> 00:31:00,507
Why would anyone come to the city?
To make money.

302
00:31:02,044 --> 00:31:03,409
Will you do anything to make money?

303
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:06,013
l'll do anything if l feel
it's right.

304
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:13,181
You've a head and
you're headstrong.

305
00:31:15,257 --> 00:31:16,349
l like you.

306
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,192
Just a while ago you said didn't like me.

307
00:31:19,895 --> 00:31:23,023
l'm like that,
l change my opinions easily.

308
00:31:23,232 --> 00:31:24,699
Do you like me?

309
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:28,725
Girls are two types.
One is chocolate and other is bullet.

310
00:31:28,904 --> 00:31:31,566
l like chocolate.
- You mean am l a bullet then?

311
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,708
You're not a chocolate.

312
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:39,037
l said for fun that you're not handsome.

313
00:31:39,248 --> 00:31:40,715
You're indeed handsome.

314
00:31:41,717 --> 00:31:45,813
My weekly prediction for this week
says l'll meet a beautiful girl.

315
00:31:46,888 --> 00:31:49,550
lf you leave me, l'll go and meet her.

316
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,727
l haven't yet given you the
permission to leave.

317
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:57,727
l didn't come here on your call,
l came here to know about you.

318
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,562
What did you know about me?

319
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:15,047
You see only a test batsman in me,

320
00:32:15,284 --> 00:32:17,684
but there's a fast pacer like
Zaheer Khan in me, you know that?

321
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,411
What's your problem, boy?

322
00:32:20,155 --> 00:32:22,851
Boy? You mean me?

323
00:32:23,592 --> 00:32:25,617
l'm sparing you because it's first time.

324
00:32:25,794 --> 00:32:27,853
Okay second time,
what's your problem boy?

325
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,759
Second time too, boy?

326
00:32:32,734 --> 00:32:35,635
l don't want to fight with you.
l want a clarification.

327
00:32:35,804 --> 00:32:38,466
When l asked who is handsome
than me in this party,

328
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,665
this idiot said you,

329
00:32:40,842 --> 00:32:43,504
tell me yourself,
who is more handsome you or me?

330
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,113
Hey idiot! lt's you!

331
00:32:47,482 --> 00:32:50,940
He said idiot,
did he call me handsome or idiot?

332
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:53,952
lf you get that doubt, brother,
it means he called you an idiot.

333
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:57,457
This is for laughing at me a while ago.

334
00:33:02,297 --> 00:33:05,130
Brother! Look there!

335
00:33:12,474 --> 00:33:19,812
Don't go away melting my heart...

336
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:30,648
My another heart will not leave you...

337
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:38,823
Remember me?

338
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:41,332
Only if l ever forget you, right?

339
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:47,336
At times your handsome face
appears in my dreams.

340
00:33:51,012 --> 00:33:53,674
But why do these fools say
he's more handsome.

341
00:33:54,349 --> 00:33:55,680
What would you like to have?

342
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:57,680
He's not worth comparing
with you, darling.

343
00:33:57,853 --> 00:33:59,878
He doesn't even know to respect women.

344
00:34:00,055 --> 00:34:02,023
Didn't he respect you?

345
00:34:02,557 --> 00:34:03,683
He didn't respect me too.

346
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:08,191
The real fight between me
and him starts now.

347
00:34:10,198 --> 00:34:12,689
Brother, Rs.50 lakhs you had
asked, take it.

348
00:34:12,868 --> 00:34:15,496
This money is not for me,
send it to peddanna.

349
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,194
Say election fund.

350
00:34:18,874 --> 00:34:23,368
peddanna will be happy and
you'll get a chance to finish Jairam.

351
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:27,374
Hey, send one more bag
just like that to me also.

352
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,112
Tell me GK!

353
00:34:33,255 --> 00:34:36,053
The money is for peddanna's
election campaign.

354
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:40,186
Tell him my support to him
will always be there for him.

355
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:44,924
GK is apple polishing you,
l suspect his motive.

356
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,831
What ever may be the motive,
he's well within our range.

357
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,063
That's his life!

358
00:34:55,277 --> 00:34:57,245
Sir, money is ready.

359
00:34:59,581 --> 00:35:01,742
Greetings sir, your offering is ready.

360
00:35:04,553 --> 00:35:07,044
Offering?! lt's Rs.180 crores!

361
00:35:07,222 --> 00:35:10,350
Tell him, l must get the ticket.

362
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:13,551
l must be made a Minister after l win.
Tell him!

363
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,757
l heard him.

364
00:35:15,931 --> 00:35:17,922
Tell him everything will
go on as he wishes.

365
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:19,961
You take it.

366
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,269
Be careful with money.

367
00:35:23,438 --> 00:35:25,269
Who will dare steal our money?

368
00:35:26,174 --> 00:35:27,664
Did you like Hyderabad?

369
00:35:27,843 --> 00:35:32,337
l like but didn't expect so
many guns and bullets here.

370
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,640
There are bullet like girls
too here, brother.

371
00:35:34,816 --> 00:35:36,943
l said about girls only.

372
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:46,658
By the way what type of girls do you like?

373
00:35:46,828 --> 00:35:48,796
Beautiful girl needn't have brain,

374
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,554
smart girl needn't have
to be beautiful.

375
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,462
lf she has both?
- She doesn't need me.

376
00:35:54,636 --> 00:35:59,130
You're right brother.
But Shirisha is different.

377
00:35:59,608 --> 00:36:04,011
She's beautiful, intelligent
and moreover good girl.

378
00:36:04,179 --> 00:36:05,646
She's humble too.

379
00:36:14,623 --> 00:36:16,648
l can see it.

380
00:36:21,563 --> 00:36:27,058
l know you were talking
about Shirisha till now.

381
00:36:27,235 --> 00:36:28,429
l'm intelligent.

382
00:36:28,637 --> 00:36:31,128
l think your brain is in Vijayawada
and liver in Lingampalli.

383
00:36:31,306 --> 00:36:32,671
Arguing with me,

384
00:36:33,008 --> 00:36:35,841
we both may be equal in handsomeness,

385
00:36:36,011 --> 00:36:37,842
but very different in intelligence,

386
00:36:38,013 --> 00:36:39,344
just one film runs in your brain,

387
00:36:39,514 --> 00:36:43,746
my brain is multiplex brain,
4 films run at the same time, you know?

388
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:46,683
Why are you staring at me?
You want to beat me?

389
00:36:48,657 --> 00:36:50,352
l don't beat women.

390
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:52,421
Did he say about you or me?

391
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,118
lf you get that doubt,
it means you darling.

392
00:36:57,232 --> 00:36:59,666
Why are you shocked to hear darling?

393
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,377
By the way who among you is
Aishwarya and who is Abishekh?

394
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:16,214
Countering my word with word,
you don't know about me,

395
00:37:16,384 --> 00:37:19,751
l'm a very very very dangerous man.
Did you hear that?

396
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:22,321
Not just one very but three times.

397
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:26,723
l think you've piles problem
not just one but all through.

398
00:37:33,368 --> 00:37:34,562
Shall we go brother?

399
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,400
Come on boys.

400
00:37:40,609 --> 00:37:42,577
What were we talking about just now?

401
00:37:42,944 --> 00:37:44,571
About girls!

402
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,377
l think you stay away from girls.

403
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:52,748
Anyone drunk or falls for girls
are same, brain stops working.

404
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:58,418
Why everyone turned serious suddenly?

405
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:30,615
Shirisha, don't worry,
l'm behind you, stand before me.

406
00:39:00,388 --> 00:39:01,980
Boys, kill him!

407
00:39:02,157 --> 00:39:05,490
You'll die.
- Not only me, you too.

408
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,390
We'll all die along with her.

409
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,092
GK, is he Jairam?

410
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:15,434
Did you plan this for him?

411
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:18,004
He's hiding behind woman
like a eunuch.

412
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:34,012
l thought lunch but
didn't expect this punch.

413
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:10,954
Just one and only handsome...

414
00:40:11,126 --> 00:40:13,117
His iron body is awesome...

415
00:40:13,294 --> 00:40:15,489
He's mine always...

416
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,598
His eyes are devastating
like nuclear attack...

417
00:40:17,766 --> 00:40:19,893
His breath is hot like sun...

418
00:40:20,068 --> 00:40:22,229
No man can take on him...

419
00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:24,564
The power of this king...

420
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:26,673
His touch can break nerves...

421
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:28,934
Any girl would fall for his smile...

422
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,135
His name is melody to lips...

423
00:40:31,312 --> 00:40:34,247
He is the right partner to me...

424
00:41:01,476 --> 00:41:03,467
He makes me search
everywhere for him...

425
00:41:03,645 --> 00:41:05,772
He tempts me from the other side...

426
00:41:05,947 --> 00:41:07,972
He makes me go crazy...

427
00:41:09,818 --> 00:41:12,013
He has shaken me specially
with mischievousness...

428
00:41:12,187 --> 00:41:16,556
Without seeking to be my partner...

429
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:18,716
lf he lends me his surname...

430
00:41:18,927 --> 00:41:20,986
l'll add it before my maiden name...

431
00:41:21,162 --> 00:41:23,289
lf he gives me little place
in his heart...

432
00:41:23,464 --> 00:41:25,329
l'll put bed and pillow there...

433
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,798
Don't know how many girls
are after him...

434
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:30,028
l'll cover him with my eyes...

435
00:41:30,205 --> 00:41:32,332
Don't know how many girls
have desired him...

436
00:41:32,507 --> 00:41:35,305
l'll ward off the evil eye cast
on him with my kisses...

437
00:42:04,906 --> 00:42:06,897
He's vaccine yearned by my youth...

438
00:42:07,075 --> 00:42:09,134
He's the monsoon my heart wants...

439
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:11,369
He's the Cupid of my dreams...

440
00:42:11,546 --> 00:42:13,104
He has raised passions in me...

441
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:17,684
He's teasing me with manliness
that he's my man in life...

442
00:42:17,852 --> 00:42:22,186
He has made me go mad...

443
00:42:22,357 --> 00:42:24,416
ln short next him is great kick...

444
00:42:24,592 --> 00:42:28,961
lf l get this handsome man,
l don't want anything else...

445
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:33,396
l'll shed my arrogance and
give myself to him...

446
00:42:33,568 --> 00:42:38,505
l'll give myself wholeheartedly
to consummate love...

447
00:42:56,624 --> 00:43:00,082
Take the vehicles, not one of
those bastards must be alive.

448
00:43:00,261 --> 00:43:03,162
Stop, don't rush boy!

449
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:06,562
He was like my brother, father.
- Brother like only.

450
00:43:07,302 --> 00:43:12,433
All these men are here to die for us,
we are not here to die for them.

451
00:43:12,607 --> 00:43:17,442
Real esatate is down; politics is
the only source to make money.

452
00:43:17,612 --> 00:43:20,342
To become a politician,
become like peddanna.

453
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:23,814
Not like a street goon, listen to me.

454
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,578
Son, learn from peddanna.

455
00:43:27,221 --> 00:43:30,816
He has hundreds of men but
uses us to kill his opponents.

456
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:34,859
l want to see you a great leader
before l die,

457
00:43:35,063 --> 00:43:37,930
but you want to go the
streets killing people.

458
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:42,696
l can understand your anger but
please try to understand me also.

459
00:43:42,837 --> 00:43:46,364
l know everything,
a new man is in town,

460
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:48,600
G K is after him to make him his man,

461
00:43:48,776 --> 00:43:51,472
it means the man is really worth,

462
00:43:51,646 --> 00:43:55,377
it's not difficult to kill
a powerful man,

463
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,781
but you need intelligence
to kill a brave man.

464
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,546
Let's wait for the time,
plan and finish him off.

465
00:44:03,257 --> 00:44:04,281
lt's not big deal.

466
00:44:10,965 --> 00:44:13,297
Stop...stop...shut up!

467
00:44:15,136 --> 00:44:15,966
peddanna's call.

468
00:44:16,971 --> 00:44:19,405
Hello brother!
- GK, peddanna is very angry.

469
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,371
l didn't do it wantonly, brother.

470
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:23,874
He attacked me first and
l had no other choice.

471
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,136
Hold on the line.

472
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:29,982
This is the last warning,
he says no second chance.

473
00:44:35,023 --> 00:44:36,991
l know that!

474
00:44:38,493 --> 00:44:42,259
Hey Kadapa! l didn't care
when people said about you.

475
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:46,025
l'm impressed seeing you
in person, l like you.

476
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,000
l'm like that anyone who
knows me little would sure like me.

477
00:45:00,681 --> 00:45:04,310
l didn't thank you for
saving my life, right?- No.

478
00:45:04,485 --> 00:45:06,146
Why?

479
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:11,622
lf anyone helps me,
l'll help them not just say thanks.

480
00:45:11,859 --> 00:45:14,657
lf you need any help from me, ask me.

481
00:45:15,229 --> 00:45:17,697
No need to ask, just blow a whistle.

482
00:45:19,033 --> 00:45:20,625
You know to whistle, right?

483
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:25,033
Blowing wind through lips making a pout.

484
00:45:38,753 --> 00:45:42,314
l was trying if l can whistle, l can.

485
00:45:43,091 --> 00:45:46,390
You'll get only bullets in this city,
you can't get chocolates.

486
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,400
Hey stop!

487
00:46:05,713 --> 00:46:06,407
Stop!

488
00:46:14,755 --> 00:46:18,088
Did anyone see a girl in half sari?
Did anyone see?

489
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:26,096
Lord Hanuman!
Why are we in so much trouble?

490
00:46:26,267 --> 00:46:28,758
Why are those rogues after me?

491
00:46:28,936 --> 00:46:30,597
Hey half sari!

492
00:46:31,939 --> 00:46:34,237
please don't tell them that l'm here.

493
00:46:34,408 --> 00:46:35,375
lf you don't tell them,

494
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:38,979
l'll ask my father to offer special
prayers for a year on your name.

495
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,239
lf l tell them?
- l'll curse you.

496
00:46:41,415 --> 00:46:43,440
My curse is very powerful.

497
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:46,646
Hey goons, she's here.

498
00:46:49,991 --> 00:46:50,787
Take her away.

499
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:53,426
This is gross injustice.

500
00:46:53,594 --> 00:46:54,561
What is she blabbering?

501
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:56,560
Not you, this man.

502
00:46:56,731 --> 00:47:01,134
That stain will not go,
God given stain, my curse.

503
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:03,129
Take her away.

504
00:47:03,538 --> 00:47:04,835
Take her.
- Come dear.

505
00:47:05,006 --> 00:47:08,533
Small problem, l'll not take easy
if anyone touches girls.

506
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:09,676
Take her without touching her.

507
00:47:09,844 --> 00:47:11,778
We'll kill you and take her.

508
00:47:54,188 --> 00:47:55,018
Come on boys!

509
00:47:55,189 --> 00:47:58,681
Just now l got into the mood,
why are you running away boys?

510
00:47:58,993 --> 00:48:01,188
Order a tea for me.
- Okay brother.

511
00:48:04,432 --> 00:48:07,492
Thanks for saving me.
- You cursed me for saving you.

512
00:48:07,668 --> 00:48:09,727
l'm worried if this stain
will go or not.

513
00:48:09,904 --> 00:48:13,135
The stain will go,
l sincerely wish it to go.

514
00:48:13,341 --> 00:48:14,205
Okay go.

515
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:16,809
l want to tell you the
problems l'm facing.

516
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:19,412
Why the demons of Ravana after us?

517
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:23,038
My father is a priest in
Lord Venkateshwara's temple.

518
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:26,044
lf we are in so much trouble
people who are close to God,

519
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,313
how can ordinary souls be secure?

520
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:34,257
Someone known as peddanna is after us,
we don't know why?

521
00:48:34,428 --> 00:48:35,827
What had actually happened was...

522
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:39,160
No need, you've something
which they want,

523
00:48:39,367 --> 00:48:41,767
you don't want to give it,
so run and chase is inevitable.

524
00:48:41,936 --> 00:48:43,597
That's all?
- That's it.

525
00:48:43,771 --> 00:48:47,571
But l wanted to answer it
like 5 mark question,

526
00:48:47,742 --> 00:48:49,437
and you said it like bit question.

527
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:51,771
Okay go and meet your parents.

528
00:48:51,946 --> 00:48:55,848
lf you give me your cell,
l'll call them.

529
00:49:00,121 --> 00:49:00,917
Take it.

530
00:49:04,725 --> 00:49:05,749
Father...

531
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,521
l don't want even a pakistani
to face such difficulties.

532
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:11,961
We are priests and peace loving citizens,
why are they torturing us?

533
00:49:12,133 --> 00:49:15,261
Are you safe my dear Ashtalakshmi?

534
00:49:15,436 --> 00:49:17,597
l'm safe father, are you safe mother?

535
00:49:17,772 --> 00:49:20,036
l'm safe dear. Are you safe?
- l'm safe mother.

536
00:49:20,174 --> 00:49:22,938
Are you safe brother?
- l'm safe, are you safe?

537
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:25,476
All are safe.

538
00:49:25,646 --> 00:49:27,273
Oh my God!

539
00:49:27,782 --> 00:49:30,945
He saved my life, father.
- ls it dear?

540
00:49:31,752 --> 00:49:35,813
You came at right time and saved
my daughter like Lord Vishnu.

541
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:41,292
Lord Vishnu! Liberation of Elephant!

542
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,298
He's not Lord Vishnu, he's Lord Shiva.

543
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:48,628
He's the God who punishes.

544
00:49:54,308 --> 00:49:57,141
Will you all clear off from here?

545
00:49:57,645 --> 00:50:01,706
Whatever you may say,
we can't go from here.

546
00:50:01,882 --> 00:50:06,012
You're handsome man with a golden heart,

547
00:50:06,187 --> 00:50:08,155
we must tell you about our problems.

548
00:50:08,322 --> 00:50:13,316
l'm just a temple priest,
why are they showing their power on us?

549
00:50:15,229 --> 00:50:19,666
Shut up! Won't you go?- No!
- Then, l'll go.

550
00:50:29,477 --> 00:50:32,537
You're the Lord to protect
in this city of sin.

551
00:50:32,713 --> 00:50:35,273
Like Lord Vishnu who saved Gajendra...

552
00:50:35,483 --> 00:50:36,780
Like Lord Krishna who saved Kuchela...

553
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:39,215
l hate praises.

554
00:50:39,687 --> 00:50:42,679
lt's your greatness to hate praise.

555
00:50:43,557 --> 00:50:45,457
You don't need to help us much,

556
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:53,692
just give us shelter in
your home for 2 days.

557
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:55,892
ls it any shelter home?

558
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:58,868
please don't criticize us.

559
00:50:59,073 --> 00:51:03,407
We know a Minister here,
we came to meet him.

560
00:51:03,577 --> 00:51:07,013
He's abroad and
would return in 2 days.

561
00:51:07,181 --> 00:51:09,376
Till then show mercy on us, sir.

562
00:51:10,785 --> 00:51:14,380
We are tired running
around since morning.

563
00:51:15,923 --> 00:51:21,225
l'm tired and exhausted, O omnipresent...

564
00:51:21,395 --> 00:51:26,389
l've come seeking final
rest place in you...

565
00:51:29,203 --> 00:51:32,661
Don't cry...l hate crying people.

566
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:36,841
We are not crying, it's spontaneous.

567
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:39,002
According to the situation.

568
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,738
Okay, come.

569
00:51:43,651 --> 00:51:46,745
l mean you can stay here.

570
00:51:49,156 --> 00:51:51,249
ln colloquial terms, it means stay.

571
00:51:51,425 --> 00:51:53,086
Really great!

572
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,854
He may change his mind,
get in quickly, father.

573
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,588
Tell me GK.

574
00:51:57,765 --> 00:52:03,761
We've got a Dubai contract.
l'm leaving to Dubai tonight.

575
00:52:04,438 --> 00:52:09,137
l'll be back in a week.
You must do me a favour, brother.

576
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:10,368
Tell me, what's it?

577
00:52:10,578 --> 00:52:12,637
You must look after Shirisha
for a week.

578
00:52:12,813 --> 00:52:14,781
Bhagawan is itching for revenge.

579
00:52:14,949 --> 00:52:16,541
She'll not listen if
l tell her not to go out.

580
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:21,620
l had promised Shirisha's father
that l'll protect her.

581
00:52:29,129 --> 00:52:34,157
When l'm here to look after you,
why do you need another man?

582
00:52:37,505 --> 00:52:39,632
Stop! l want to buy fruits.

583
00:52:45,312 --> 00:52:46,643
What's the price of apples?

584
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,472
Rs.15 an apple.

585
00:52:53,487 --> 00:52:55,352
That one?
- Rs.15 only, madam.

586
00:52:55,523 --> 00:52:57,320
That apple?
- Rs.15 only, madam.

587
00:52:57,525 --> 00:52:59,356
That apple?
- Rs.15 only, madam.

588
00:52:59,527 --> 00:53:01,495
Any apple here is Rs.15 only.

589
00:53:01,729 --> 00:53:04,698
l got it yesterday for Rs.14 each,

590
00:53:04,865 --> 00:53:08,494
if you increase price by a rupee
overnight, how can we live?

591
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:10,666
Go!

592
00:53:11,805 --> 00:53:13,363
Apples are on that side also, right?

593
00:53:13,541 --> 00:53:16,339
l must feel if she buys from
that side, why are you feeling?

594
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:18,535
Won't l feel irritated
if she falls on me?

595
00:53:18,712 --> 00:53:20,509
how can anyone feel irritated
if girls fall men?

596
00:53:20,681 --> 00:53:22,512
Where are girls here?

597
00:53:24,285 --> 00:53:30,246
Brahmam, one punch for both of us.
- l got it. Don't explain.

598
00:53:30,391 --> 00:53:35,021
l've been watching you,
you're not respecting me at al.

599
00:53:35,996 --> 00:53:38,123
You want respect?
Die!

600
00:53:38,999 --> 00:53:41,399
l respect the dead very much.

601
00:53:41,569 --> 00:53:43,730
They put new clothes and
decorate the body.

602
00:53:43,904 --> 00:53:46,805
They take carefully in a coffin.

603
00:53:47,207 --> 00:53:49,675
They sprinkle scented water
and flowers on the way.

604
00:53:49,843 --> 00:53:52,812
They arrange a condolence meeting
later and praise the dead.

605
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,038
Die!

606
00:53:56,884 --> 00:54:00,547
He's asking me to die, why?
- Don't involve me in it, darling.

607
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,922
This is known as pub,
you wouldn't have seen it.

608
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:46,998
pub or club anything is same
to get drunk and shell out money.

609
00:54:47,167 --> 00:54:49,897
You speak like a goon but
always say the right thing,

610
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:52,436
what did you study?
- Humans!

611
00:55:00,314 --> 00:55:02,612
ls he the handsome you said about?
- Yes.

612
00:55:03,684 --> 00:55:05,151
Very speed.

613
00:55:05,319 --> 00:55:08,117
Not just speed but good mileage too.

614
00:55:09,523 --> 00:55:12,788
You carry on talking.
- You go, we'll carry on.

615
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:16,458
l think Shirisha likes you,
but l feel you're not interested.

616
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:17,927
My interest is elsewhere.

617
00:55:18,098 --> 00:55:19,963
Shirisha is good girl, brother-in-law.

618
00:55:20,134 --> 00:55:21,624
Good girl but...

619
00:55:23,704 --> 00:55:26,138
She has one bad quality.
- What's it?

620
00:55:27,307 --> 00:55:28,171
lntelligence.

621
00:55:30,177 --> 00:55:32,338
l've a doubt now.
- What's it?

622
00:55:32,513 --> 00:55:34,640
You too have fallen for Shirisha.

623
00:55:35,282 --> 00:55:36,977
How did you find it?

624
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,825
party is over, come.
- poor Brahmam.

625
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,329
Deposit the money carefully.

626
00:56:18,025 --> 00:56:19,856
You don't know me.

627
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,194
Bhagawan's father Gangaiah.

628
00:56:26,233 --> 00:56:28,599
Don't trust GK,
you can never come good.

629
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:33,364
When we enter Hyderabad, there's a
board saying Welcome to Hyderabad.

630
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,030
You know the meaning of it?

631
00:56:35,576 --> 00:56:37,043
lt means don't trust anyone.

632
00:56:37,211 --> 00:56:41,705
You're a good speaker.
But please listen carefully.

633
00:56:42,182 --> 00:56:47,882
Ever since you killed Jairam,
my son is furious on you.

634
00:56:48,222 --> 00:56:51,714
l'm stopping him,
that's why you're still alive.

635
00:56:52,426 --> 00:56:58,558
Before he beheads you,
listen to my words and join my gang.

636
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:00,896
l'll ensure that he doesn't harm you.

637
00:57:01,068 --> 00:57:04,799
lf you'd told me convincingly,
l would've thought about it,

638
00:57:04,972 --> 00:57:07,839
l'm not a kid to get
scared for threats,

639
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:09,566
l'm a man from Kadapa.

640
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:14,741
Don't cross swords with me,
you can't bear it.

641
00:57:27,127 --> 00:57:32,155
l trust your holy feet...
your divine holy feet...

642
00:57:32,332 --> 00:57:34,357
What happened priest?

643
00:57:39,573 --> 00:57:40,096
What happened to him?

644
00:57:40,274 --> 00:57:43,937
He hasn't eaten anything
for 2 days now.

645
00:57:44,111 --> 00:57:47,103
He won't eat outside food.

646
00:57:47,281 --> 00:57:51,012
Don't excited, you've asthma
and blood pressure.

647
00:57:51,185 --> 00:57:53,847
We need provisions to cook here,

648
00:57:54,021 --> 00:57:56,114
we need to go out to get it,

649
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:58,952
we need courage to go out,

650
00:57:59,193 --> 00:58:01,423
and it's not in our entire clan.

651
00:58:01,595 --> 00:58:07,795
Today is my son's birthday,
look how he has grown thin in 2 days.

652
00:58:08,168 --> 00:58:11,262
He's getting punished for
taking birth as my son.

653
00:58:11,438 --> 00:58:15,966
Don't worry about my birthday, father.

654
00:58:16,143 --> 00:58:19,237
See that my father eats something.

655
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:20,641
Shut up!

656
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:24,045
people may mistake a TV soap
shooting is going here.

657
00:58:24,218 --> 00:58:25,708
Ashtalakshmi, come with me.

658
00:58:26,019 --> 00:58:28,886
He's calling me, mother.
Can l go?- Go dear.

659
00:58:29,056 --> 00:58:33,254
Get some offering from some temple,

660
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:36,487
your father will eat till
l finish cooking.

661
00:58:42,302 --> 00:58:46,466
Hello, he's not some municipal
officer but God.

662
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,868
please pray.

663
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:50,839
l'll not irritate him, you carry on.

664
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,545
May you get married at the earliest!

665
00:58:56,717 --> 00:59:01,518
We are not lovers!
Anyway, how can l love him.

666
00:59:01,688 --> 00:59:04,350
l didn't bless you, but this couple.

667
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,052
Not to me, say sorry to him.

668
00:59:11,265 --> 00:59:15,531
Hello...when l said l don't love you,

669
00:59:15,702 --> 00:59:17,636
l didn't mean you don't
deserve to be loved.

670
00:59:17,771 --> 00:59:21,036
l'm not in love with you now,
it doesn't mean l'll love later,

671
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:23,369
and l don't l'll never love you,

672
00:59:23,543 --> 00:59:25,773
anyway we are Brahmins
and you're non-Brahmins,

673
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,413
l didn't mean we are high
and you're low,

674
00:59:28,582 --> 00:59:31,710
community elders will get anger
if l marry out of community.

675
00:59:31,885 --> 00:59:35,252
lf you visit Kasi once,
you'll be purified.

676
00:59:35,422 --> 00:59:37,253
l don't mean to say you impure now.

677
00:59:37,424 --> 00:59:40,052
l don't know how to stop this...

678
00:59:45,565 --> 00:59:48,728
l forgot to take offering.
- Get it.

679
01:00:09,923 --> 01:00:12,118
Do you know what l'm feeling now?

680
01:00:12,292 --> 01:00:13,725
What do you feel?

681
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,454
l feel it'll be good if
another speeding car comes.

682
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:18,291
Why do you feel so?

683
01:00:18,465 --> 01:00:20,797
You'll hug me again, right?

684
01:00:20,968 --> 01:00:22,936
Why do you need a car for that?

685
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:31,173
lf you don't mind,
l'll tell you one thing.

686
01:00:31,345 --> 01:00:33,643
You'll tell even if l mind or don't.
Go ahead.

687
01:00:33,814 --> 01:00:37,306
l fell for you at the first sight.

688
01:00:37,584 --> 01:00:42,715
l feel you too have fallen for me.

689
01:00:42,856 --> 01:00:44,016
How did you find it?

690
01:00:44,191 --> 01:00:47,024
Girls are smart in such things.

691
01:00:47,194 --> 01:00:51,130
l don't know abut other girls
but you're damn sharp.

692
01:00:51,465 --> 01:00:54,662
Enchanted girl priyamani...

693
01:00:54,835 --> 01:00:57,599
Stepped outside in dream...

694
01:00:57,771 --> 01:01:00,968
Will she jump the fence?

695
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:05,401
Will it make her break the rules?

696
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:22,123
You've taken over me, O handsome...

697
01:01:22,295 --> 01:01:26,163
Allow me to have little
of you in my arms...

698
01:01:28,068 --> 01:01:33,335
You weren't rushing till now,
why this sudden change?

699
01:01:33,507 --> 01:01:38,274
The handsome man in you
has spread magic on me...

700
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:41,744
l'm right before you seeking,
will you become my partner?

701
01:01:41,882 --> 01:01:45,318
Has your passionate youth
seeking pleasures?

702
01:01:45,485 --> 01:01:49,353
l swear l'll give whatever you seek...

703
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:56,357
l'll solve your problem...

704
01:02:42,075 --> 01:02:49,072
l'll vanish it with my magic wand...

705
01:02:55,689 --> 01:03:02,458
My cheeks are angry for not getting
smooched or pinched, want to pinch it?

706
01:03:02,629 --> 01:03:07,726
lf you throw an open invitation,
l'll have a blast...

707
01:03:07,901 --> 01:03:14,568
Though there are many bonds,
l wish you take me with both hands...

708
01:03:14,741 --> 01:03:21,112
Can't l protect you always giving
more than what you seek...

709
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:14,162
l'm waiting for you saving this
tender body with secret moles...

710
01:04:14,334 --> 01:04:19,499
l'm coming leaving everything
else for you...

711
01:04:19,673 --> 01:04:26,511
l'm welcoming you with flower balls
and spreading feast of youth on platter...

712
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:32,676
Taking you gracefully in my arms,
l've become yours...

713
01:05:09,789 --> 01:05:11,984
What are you doing?
- l'm with chocolate.

714
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:14,218
You mean am l a chocolate?

715
01:05:15,595 --> 01:05:19,725
You'll not get chocolates in this city,
come and take me out for lunch.

716
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:24,561
Just we two.
No one else should be there.

717
01:05:31,044 --> 01:05:33,012
So, this is your chocolate.

718
01:05:33,146 --> 01:05:35,774
My name is Ashtalakshmi,
nickname is Ammulu.

719
01:05:36,483 --> 01:05:38,246
My brother Adinarayana.

720
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:39,811
Do you like her?

721
01:05:39,986 --> 01:05:42,079
Anyone would like chocolate.

722
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:45,889
Tell him to take off his hands

723
01:05:46,059 --> 01:05:49,119
Don't know why, l don't want
him to take his hands off me.

724
01:05:49,296 --> 01:05:51,526
Ever since he put his
hands on my waist.

725
01:05:53,433 --> 01:05:56,095
put hands on waist?
When?

726
01:05:56,836 --> 01:05:58,929
He hugged me too later.

727
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,608
Hugged too?

728
01:06:04,311 --> 01:06:09,146
l can't hear this disaster anymore.
l'll complain to father.

729
01:06:09,316 --> 01:06:13,184
Tell him, l'll also tell him.
- What?

730
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:16,947
That you eat egg from your
classmate prasad's lunch box.

731
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:22,957
Okay, you forget about my mistake
and l'll forget your mistake.

732
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:26,127
Don't tell anyone, l beg you.

733
01:06:26,766 --> 01:06:28,199
You can talk without putting
hands on her too.

734
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,562
Yes indeed.

735
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:31,396
You're sweet boy!

736
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:35,473
Why did you come out without telling me?

737
01:06:37,177 --> 01:06:39,805
Do you know how much l was
bothered about your safety?

738
01:06:47,954 --> 01:06:49,319
Who is this boy?

739
01:06:49,489 --> 01:06:52,617
l'll blow up your head
if you call me a boy.

740
01:06:52,792 --> 01:06:54,191
Who is he like a mini conference?

741
01:06:54,394 --> 01:06:56,521
Who is he? Comic relief for us?

742
01:06:56,696 --> 01:06:59,631
Hey curd rice! one punch and
your stomach will blow up.

743

l don't want to talk to you,

744
01:07:03,837 --> 01:07:06,101
l'll curse him.
- Will you curse me?

745
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:08,503
No...please don't give him permission.

746
01:07:08,675 --> 01:07:11,166
His curse is very powerful.
- ls it really so powerful?

747
01:07:11,344 --> 01:07:13,539
Yes, indeed.- l want permission.
-please no.

748
01:07:13,713 --> 01:07:17,513

749
01:07:17,684 --> 01:07:18,981
come on give him permission.

01:07:22,355 --> 01:07:24,516

754
01:07:55,722 --> 01:07:56,711
Tell me manager.

755
01:07:56,890 --> 01:07:58,881
That Kadapa man is in our restaurant.

756

Just do as l say.
- Okay sir.

and take the crore.

764
01:08:34,127 --> 01:08:36,254
Do you've to hire men to kill him?

01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:40,022
Eat without any hesitation.

766

Does my body look like
l'll hesitate to eat?

767
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:46,070
Why are you sending us out

Where are you now?

Gangaiah has offered Rs.1 crore
for brother's head.

771
01:09:03,256 --> 01:09:06,350
They are coming, inform brother
and leave the place immediately.

772
01:09:10,864 --> 01:09:13,628
Restaurant is empty.

773
01:09:15,335 --> 01:09:18,463
You call Gangaiah.
- Why?- Just do it.

774
01:09:20,707 --> 01:09:25,269
Hey Ganga, your offering of 1 crore

779
01:09:37,524 --> 01:09:40,652
You'll save time and
matter will be settled.

780
01:09:41,194 --> 01:09:42,491
What happened?

781
01:09:43,129 --> 01:09:44,391
Change in program.

782
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,326
Are you going to Bhagawan's home?

783
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:51,563
l want to earn money, l'll get
a crore, why are you stopping me?

784
01:09:51,738 --> 01:09:53,865
Why do you want to take
such risk for money?

785
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,507
l'll do anything for money.

786
01:10:00,213 --> 01:10:03,011
Where ever l may be, you'll be here!

787
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:07,510
l'll take care of money.

788
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:23,697
Stop!

789
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:30,367
You got beaten up once,
you'll die now.

790
01:10:52,098 --> 01:10:55,067
Hey! Kill him and come up
and take the money.

791
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:03,073
What man?

792
01:11:55,828 --> 01:11:58,626
Were you ready to pay a crore
for these filthy men?

793
01:11:58,798 --> 01:12:00,459
You said they are the best.

794
01:12:23,856 --> 01:12:27,485
Wait...listen to me...come son...

795
01:12:29,362 --> 01:12:31,421
Stop...stop l say...
- l'll kill him.

796
01:12:31,564 --> 01:12:34,533
The crore is mine, l'll take it
if you don't have any objections.

797
01:12:34,701 --> 01:12:35,895
Take it.

798
01:12:36,069 --> 01:12:37,730
Father.
- Wait son.

799
01:12:37,904 --> 01:12:41,305
He reached the top beating
every man on the way,

800
01:12:41,474 --> 01:12:44,500
it's not wrong to accept defeat,
you take it.

801
01:12:46,813 --> 01:12:49,179
Stay away from him son
else you'll die.

802
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,030
Did you see? Were you telling me
to surrender to him?

803
01:13:11,237 --> 01:13:12,204
Did you see?

804
01:14:06,559 --> 01:14:11,656
Hey Kadapa man! l'm a dying old man!

805
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:15,262
please fulfill my last wish.
- Tell me what's it?

806
01:14:15,501 --> 01:14:19,301
l'll tell a phone number,
dial and give me.

807
01:14:23,776 --> 01:14:24,367
Tell me Ganganna.

808
01:14:24,544 --> 01:14:29,106
Kadapa man has destroyed me
and my empire.

809
01:14:29,582 --> 01:14:31,777
He has killed my son too.

810
01:14:32,585 --> 01:14:33,950
l'm also dying.

811
01:14:35,121 --> 01:14:39,114
Tell peddanna, don't spare Kadapa man,

812
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:44,158
Hey, give the phone to peddanna.

813
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:45,422
Who are you man?

814
01:14:45,598 --> 01:14:47,532
l'm the Kadapa man he told you about.

815
01:14:48,367 --> 01:14:52,463
l don't know who you are,
but start counting,

816
01:14:52,638 --> 01:14:55,436
not days but hours,

817
01:14:55,608 --> 01:14:58,873
tomorrow your body will have post mortem.

818
01:14:59,045 --> 01:15:04,108
Doctors will remove 25 bullets
from your boy.

819
01:15:04,283 --> 01:15:08,276
Man without courage will try
to find new words to threaten.

820
01:15:08,454 --> 01:15:10,888
Your end is nearing.

821
01:15:11,057 --> 01:15:13,890
Your time is good because
you're not here.

822
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:16,290
You'r head would've got blown up

823
01:15:16,462 --> 01:15:17,827
and your post mortem
would've happened tomorrow.

824
01:15:18,598 --> 01:15:22,830
Anyone who challenged me died.

825
01:15:23,002 --> 01:15:26,335
You too dared, you too would die.

826
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:29,263
This is not my warning but ultimatum.

827
01:15:53,165 --> 01:15:56,692
Drinks break is over,
wicket will fall in this over.

828
01:15:56,869 --> 01:15:58,530
Score will crash down.

829
01:15:58,704 --> 01:16:00,296
My bet is Rs.10000.

830
01:16:00,473 --> 01:16:02,498
What's this man?
A cockroach in biryani.

831
01:16:02,675 --> 01:16:04,768
Cockroach in my hotel? No way,
it'll be grasshopper, check it.

832
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:05,773
lt'll be good.

833
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:09,971
We can anticipate in which over wicket
will fall and when they'll hit 6.

834
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:11,207
That's my sixth sense.

835
01:16:11,384 --> 01:16:14,353
Don't worry about money,
it's always in my back pocket.

836
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:19,389
l'm always ready to bet.
Yes, l'm telling you, right?

837
01:16:19,759 --> 01:16:21,226
ls this your purse, brother?

838
01:16:24,597 --> 01:16:25,894
Who are you guys?

839
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:31,159
Heard that Kadapa man will
be here only, where is he?

840
01:16:33,806 --> 01:16:36,434
Why do you want to risk
so much for money?

841
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:52,013
By elections to Kadapa
have been announced,

842
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:55,126
let's get more details
from our reporter Sai.

843
01:16:55,294 --> 01:17:01,255
Tell us about the challenges faced
from rebel candidate Devender Reddy?

844
01:17:01,434 --> 01:17:06,394
Former MLA who lost the nomination
facing many corruption charges,

845
01:17:06,572 --> 01:17:08,403
but he's contesting as
a rebel candidate,

846
01:17:08,574 --> 01:17:13,034
but it's doubtful that he can win
back the voters to his side.

847
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:19,981
Dr.Nirmala Devi who runs free
hospital for poor is supporting him.

848
01:17:20,152 --> 01:17:23,588
ls it true?
- lf that is true, she's sure to win.

849
01:17:23,756 --> 01:17:27,487
Because poor people here consider
her as Mother Theresa.

850
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:30,254
lf she appeals people to vote
for any particular candidate,

851
01:17:30,429 --> 01:17:32,624
people would vote enmasse.

852
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:35,867
Nirmala madam, you will support me.

853
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:37,057
Greetings madam.

854
01:17:42,441 --> 01:17:46,468
Brother, l'm hungry,
please give me something to eat.

855
01:17:46,779 --> 01:17:47,803
True...

856
01:17:48,014 --> 01:17:49,106
Where are your parents?

857
01:17:49,281 --> 01:17:51,511
My mother died and
my father is in jail.

858
01:17:51,684 --> 01:17:54,312
Come with me.

859
01:18:02,361 --> 01:18:06,422
He'll be with us hereafter.
- Okay madam.

860
01:18:07,666 --> 01:18:09,497
Greetings madam.
- Greetings madam.

861
01:18:14,774 --> 01:18:17,538
Hello doctor!
- Who is this?

862
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:20,439
Tell me, what do you want?

863
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:23,446
l want your support in this by-election.

864
01:18:23,716 --> 01:18:28,176
l don't want politics,
l'm just an ordinary doctor.

865
01:18:28,354 --> 01:18:33,451
l know you don't have a penny
other than that stethoscope.

866
01:18:33,626 --> 01:18:38,188
people too know it.
That's why they praise you to hilt.

867
01:18:38,364 --> 01:18:40,855
That's why l'm seeking your support.

868
01:18:41,033 --> 01:18:44,730
You know the reason for
seeking your support.

869
01:18:44,904 --> 01:18:49,204
You owe your fame to that hospital.

870
01:18:49,408 --> 01:18:53,367
That building was donated
to you by Drupada Reddy.

871
01:18:53,913 --> 01:18:55,210
My father!

872
01:18:56,749 --> 01:18:59,081
l'm asking you with that right.

873
01:18:59,251 --> 01:19:01,879
lf you're a good man,
you don't need anyone's support.

874
01:19:02,054 --> 01:19:06,548
l know you'll not listen to pleas,
so l got your daughter kidnapped.

875
01:19:08,694 --> 01:19:12,721
Media will come to you in an hour,
announce your support to me,

876
01:19:12,898 --> 01:19:16,231
if not your daughter's body
will reach your home.

877
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:20,237
pull it up!

878
01:19:23,909 --> 01:19:25,900
Are you supporting Devender Reddy?

879
01:19:26,078 --> 01:19:30,412
l'm not supporting any candidate.
l'm allergic to politics.

880
01:19:37,656 --> 01:19:39,624
Kill her boys!
- Okay brother-in-law.

881
01:19:39,925 --> 01:19:41,688
Brother-in-law has ordered to kill her.

882
01:19:42,094 --> 01:19:44,460
How is the sari? l like the colour.

883
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:46,962
Broader border would've been better.
What do you say?

884
01:19:47,133 --> 01:19:51,001
We've kidnapped you
and about to kill you,

885
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:54,639
your mother says like that
and you're talking about sari,

886
01:19:54,807 --> 01:19:55,569
what makes you so brave?

887
01:19:55,741 --> 01:19:58,232
Ask not what makes me brave,
ask who makes me brave.

888
01:19:58,410 --> 01:20:02,107
Do you know who is he?
Sathya! My brother!

889
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:20,794
Kadapa! lf things are fine,
it's sugarcane,

890
01:20:20,966 --> 01:20:22,558
if you go against, it's fight!

891
01:20:24,336 --> 01:20:27,032
After speaking to him for sometime,
you know what's their reaction.

892
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:29,036
You mustn't be here, brother.

893
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:32,142
Greetings brother...
- Farmers too must make profits, right?

894
01:20:32,311 --> 01:20:34,006
You're great brother.
- Brother mustn't be here!

895
01:20:34,213 --> 01:20:37,046
But he's here only, do you know why?
For us!

896
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:39,911
He was an orphan and
my mother adopted him.

897
01:20:40,052 --> 01:20:41,986
He loves me so much.

898
01:20:42,221 --> 01:20:44,018
l've got a good proposal for sister.

899
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:46,420
He's not one who studied here
and working in America,

900
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,685
he studied there and
wants to serve people here,

901
01:20:48,861 --> 01:20:50,453
moreover he's a doctor
and a good man too.

902
01:20:50,629 --> 01:20:53,063
Forget about her marriage,
when are you going to marry?

903
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:55,460
Yes brother, l'll marry along
with your marriage, brother.

904
01:20:55,634 --> 01:20:57,625
Then find a bride,
l'll marry, it's done.

905
01:20:57,803 --> 01:20:59,236
Marry me!

906
01:20:59,405 --> 01:21:01,339
Doctors! Leave me alone.

907
01:21:01,507 --> 01:21:02,667
Sister, shall we?

908
01:21:02,841 --> 01:21:05,674
You don't stay with us
but find proposals for me.

909
01:21:05,844 --> 01:21:09,007
Why don't you also stay with me, son?

910
01:21:09,181 --> 01:21:11,911
Mother, l'm mass and
my friends are mass.

911
01:21:12,051 --> 01:21:14,178
lf l stay with you,
you'll be embarrassed.

912
01:21:14,353 --> 01:21:17,186
Where ever l may be, you'll be here!

913
01:21:18,257 --> 01:21:19,281
What are you trying to tell now?

914
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:21,892
He won't keep quiet if any
injustice happens to innocents,

915
01:21:22,061 --> 01:21:24,552
would he keep quiet if anything
happens to mother's family?

916
01:21:24,730 --> 01:21:27,198
He'll not keep quiet,
he'll do something.

917
01:21:27,833 --> 01:21:31,269
Whatever he does,
you're in for a real shock.

918
01:21:33,205 --> 01:21:35,469
Brother-in-law, drop the girl
safely in her home.

919
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:37,700
Brother-in-law!
- Do as l said.

920
01:21:39,245 --> 01:21:41,907
What's this man? Brother-in-law wants
me to drop her at home.

921
01:21:42,081 --> 01:21:43,343
Got the shock?

922
01:21:43,515 --> 01:21:45,073
Shall l tell what would've happened?

923
01:21:45,251 --> 01:21:47,219
Hubby, please come and see there.

924
01:21:47,386 --> 01:21:49,013
Come!
- What's your problem?

925
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:50,246
Come fast.

926
01:21:50,422 --> 01:21:52,253
l'm attending an important call,
why are you disturbing me?

927
01:21:52,424 --> 01:21:53,550
Look there!

928
01:21:57,596 --> 01:22:00,224
Come brother Devendra, let's have meal.

929
01:22:09,008 --> 01:22:11,704
They all had it, except you.

930
01:22:11,877 --> 01:22:14,903
You too have it, please sit down.

931
01:22:15,247 --> 01:22:16,236
l said sit!

932
01:22:17,616 --> 01:22:20,551
Curries are great,
did you prepare it, sister-in-law?- Yes.

933
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:23,153
Good wife, great father,

934
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:26,756
how could you become like this though
born to a great father like him?

935
01:22:27,026 --> 01:22:28,323
l must beat you.

936
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:34,856
For what you'd done today, people
would've put garlands to your photo.

937
01:22:35,034 --> 01:22:36,592
do you know why l stopped
from doing it?

938
01:22:36,769 --> 01:22:38,430
Because you're son of that great man.

939
01:22:38,971 --> 01:22:40,336
Call your man.

940
01:22:44,343 --> 01:22:47,437
Make a note in your brain
not to cross swords with me.

941
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:52,343
lf you fight with me,
you'll forget that you're a man.

942
01:23:17,810 --> 01:23:21,576
Madam, this building and
land surrounding it,

943
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:24,910
Devender Reddy's father late Drupada Reddy,

944
01:23:25,084 --> 01:23:28,212
just on the word of mouth
without any written documents,

945
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,513
donated this to run an hospital,

946
01:23:30,689 --> 01:23:35,626
as his son and heir Devender has
all the rights over this property.

947
01:23:35,794 --> 01:23:38,092
So according to the court's order,

948
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:41,427
you've to vacate this place in 3 months,

949
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:45,832
if not you've to pay Rs.87 crores
according to today's land value,

950
01:23:46,171 --> 01:23:49,334
if not court will forcibly
vacate you from this place.

951
01:23:52,745 --> 01:23:56,511
lf you shut down this hospital
that serves so many poor,

952
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:58,773
what will become of them?

953
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:01,181
You and them go to the streets.

954
01:24:01,353 --> 01:24:03,514
Bloody street woman!
- Bloody bastard!

955
01:24:04,256 --> 01:24:05,518
What's this?

956
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:20,366
Stop son!

957
01:24:33,252 --> 01:24:37,382
Stop son!

958
01:24:40,959 --> 01:24:43,154
l've stopped because mother stopped me.

959
01:24:43,295 --> 01:24:47,061
lf not l would've beaten through
Kadapa streets to your home.

960
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:49,496
For next three months,

961
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:51,397
if l see you around this
hospital or in Kadapa,

962
01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:55,563
l'll not beat you this time,
l'll bury you alive. Get lost!

963
01:25:00,245 --> 01:25:03,180
Mother, l'll take care of money.

964
01:25:03,949 --> 01:25:08,579
This hospital will not be closed,
it'll run as usual. l promise.

965
01:25:17,062 --> 01:25:19,758
Look brother, here goes the hero.

966
01:25:21,733 --> 01:25:25,225
Don't call him a hero, it hurts my ego.

967
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:29,534
l demanded respect and
he wants me to die.

968
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:32,643
When a crore is offered for his head,
he goes to his home to take it.

969
01:25:32,811 --> 01:25:35,712
l don't mind if it's anywhere
but he says it before Shirisha,

970
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:39,977
he may say it but l'm worried
Shirisha will fall for him.

971
01:25:40,152 --> 01:25:42,143
You know this flash news, brother.
- What's it?

972
01:25:42,321 --> 01:25:45,347
Shirisha has fallen for him long back.

973
01:25:46,592 --> 01:25:49,755
Brother, can l tell you scrolling news?
- What's it, tell me?

974
01:25:49,928 --> 01:25:54,297
That girl in the temple too loves him.

975
01:25:54,466 --> 01:25:57,299
Don't know who among the two
would be lucky to get him.

976
01:25:57,469 --> 01:25:59,937
Why are you seeing up?
- You too see up, brother.

977
01:26:00,105 --> 01:26:02,471
See how he's raising passionate fires!

978
01:26:30,569 --> 01:26:33,402
Fight...fight...

979
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:38,007
This is a fight of plaits...

980
01:26:46,018 --> 01:26:47,986
My dear, l like your cut out...

981
01:26:48,153 --> 01:26:50,178
lt has brightened my stars of luck...

982
01:26:50,355 --> 01:26:52,516
lt has raced up my pulse rate...

983
01:26:52,691 --> 01:26:55,592
lt has made me fall into
a maze of intoxication...

984
01:26:55,761 --> 01:26:59,288
l'm steady on you and
l've sworn to be yours...

985
01:26:59,431 --> 01:27:01,558
l'm getting engulfed in fire of
passion because of you...

986
01:27:01,733 --> 01:27:04,793
lf you say yes,
me and my beauty is all yours...

987
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:07,871
Oh my God, bullet babe's heat...

988
01:27:09,441 --> 01:27:12,376
Chocolate babe's fire is killing...

989
01:27:13,612 --> 01:27:17,070
l'm hit with force from both sides...

990
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:07,188
When high love fever struck me
and makes me yearn for you...

991
01:28:07,366 --> 01:28:09,459
Will you keep watching the fun?

992
01:28:09,668 --> 01:28:12,796
Can't you become my partner
showing sympathy?

993
01:28:12,971 --> 01:28:14,461
Great wish!

994
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:18,474
l'll get into your lap and
sing lullabies...

995
01:28:18,677 --> 01:28:21,145
Will you give me your hand
to hold on?

996
01:28:21,313 --> 01:28:25,773
Mass on side and class on side...
Who will get the lucky chance?

997
01:28:25,951 --> 01:28:30,615
Heads or tails...whoever wins
will race up the pulse?

998
01:28:30,789 --> 01:28:34,486
My lips are chanting
your name only, boss...

999
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:39,893
Half saris are getting ready for you...
and are welcoming you wholeheartedly...

1000
01:29:20,105 --> 01:29:26,510
Whether you say yes or no,
you're tempting before me, l'm coming...

1001
01:29:26,678 --> 01:29:31,843
l'll give anything to you
in moments, my dear...

1002
01:29:32,017 --> 01:29:33,780
Come on...

1003
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:37,854
l've opened the locker of my beauty
and giving you the keys...

1004
01:29:38,023 --> 01:29:40,457
l wish you to rob me of everything...

1005
01:29:40,592 --> 01:29:44,858
Come on dear...l felt pity and
opened the doors of my heart...

1006
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:47,225
Come into my arms...

1007
01:29:47,399 --> 01:29:49,867
l've opened the fort of youth for you...

1008
01:29:50,035 --> 01:29:53,732
Counting from one,
shall l kiss you a crore times?

1009
01:29:53,905 --> 01:29:55,896
Shed shyness on my own...

1010
01:29:56,074 --> 01:29:58,872
Open up the treasure for you...

1011
01:30:24,102 --> 01:30:26,229
Hero must be like that!

1012
01:30:28,106 --> 01:30:31,564
ls he a hero? l'll show you
how a hero should be.

1013
01:30:31,743 --> 01:30:32,732
How can you show?

1014
01:30:34,746 --> 01:30:37,180
l'll rob jewels in broad day light,

1015
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:40,341
and escape without getting caught,

1016
01:30:40,619 --> 01:30:42,086
and show my true power!

1017
01:30:53,932 --> 01:30:55,365
Show them that design.

1018
01:30:59,671 --> 01:31:01,434
Tell me what can l do for you sir?

1019
01:31:01,606 --> 01:31:04,370
lnfact l'm here to help you.

1020
01:31:04,543 --> 01:31:07,103
Charles Basavaraj,
an international jewel thief.

1021
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:08,644
l mean international jewel thief.

1022
01:31:09,414 --> 01:31:12,110
He's going to rob yourjewellary shop.

1023
01:31:13,451 --> 01:31:14,611
Really? oh God!

1024
01:31:14,786 --> 01:31:17,550
Why are you searching elsewhere?
He's right before you.

1025
01:31:17,689 --> 01:31:20,157
Just follow my orders and
you can catch him easily.

1026
01:31:20,325 --> 01:31:22,293
Tell me, what should l do sir?

1027
01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:25,224
He'll ask you to pack all the jewels
in a bag, do it without protest,

1028
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:29,356
we'll wait outside to round him up,

1029
01:31:29,534 --> 01:31:31,559
we'll catch him red handedly.

1030
01:31:31,703 --> 01:31:35,696
After that he'll cool heels in the jail.

1031
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:38,432
And you can sell gold happily in shop.

1032
01:31:42,314 --> 01:31:44,282
See that there's no security outside,

1033
01:31:44,449 --> 01:31:46,815
he's afraid of security
and may not come.

1034
01:31:59,865 --> 01:32:01,457
pack it.
- Okay sir.

1035
01:32:01,633 --> 01:32:03,464
You get it.
- Why are you watching?

1036
01:32:11,209 --> 01:32:12,471
Turn back.
- Okay sir.

1037
01:32:12,644 --> 01:32:13,668
Count to 30.

1038
01:32:13,845 --> 01:32:20,842
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

1039
01:32:33,932 --> 01:32:37,368
Brother! You're a real hero!

1040
01:32:37,535 --> 01:32:40,197
Tell that to people who don't know.
Come.

1041
01:32:44,276 --> 01:32:46,369
Brother, show hand to the left.

1042
01:32:50,882 --> 01:32:53,715
Hey, stop the vehicle.

1043
01:32:56,521 --> 01:32:58,386
My chain!

1044
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:01,425
What happened brother?

1045
01:33:01,593 --> 01:33:03,891
One took my bracelet and
another took my chain.

1046
01:33:06,031 --> 01:33:07,055
Vehicle too!

1047
01:33:13,371 --> 01:33:16,704
Krishna prasad aka Basavaraj,

l'll get insurance also,

1051
01:33:24,916 --> 01:33:29,410

chain and vehicle too.

1052
01:33:29,587 --> 01:33:33,079

and take you to jail.

1053
01:33:33,258 --> 01:33:36,921
lt's loss to you all the way!
You go.

1054
01:33:40,432 --> 01:33:41,922
police!

1055
01:33:43,268 --> 01:33:44,098
Where are they?

1056
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:52,467
Saviour of Gokula....

1057
01:33:52,644 --> 01:33:54,009
What's again priest?

1058
01:33:54,179 --> 01:33:58,275
protector of the good...

1059
01:33:59,985 --> 01:34:03,079
Why are we in for this test of fire, God?

1060
01:34:03,254 --> 01:34:08,624
We walk to your abode and
tonsure my son's head too.

1061
01:34:11,496 --> 01:34:13,430
please don't cry, you've low Bp.

1062
01:34:13,598 --> 01:34:16,965
We'll do your crying part too.

1063
01:34:19,337 --> 01:34:20,804
Stop it!

1064
01:34:21,673 --> 01:34:23,971
Tell me now, what's your real story?

1065
01:34:24,442 --> 01:34:27,172
We are from a village near Vijayanagaram.

1066
01:34:27,345 --> 01:34:31,304
My brother got ajob in
a Hyderabad software company.

1067
01:34:33,184 --> 01:34:39,817
My father bought a flat for brother
spending his lifelong savings,

1068
01:34:40,725 --> 01:34:45,992
after few days near our flat,
what's that?

1069
01:34:46,698 --> 01:34:48,825
Cricket betting.

1070
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,331
They opened a cricket betting centre.

1071
01:34:51,269 --> 01:34:56,935
Not only opened it but threatened
to give his flat for money,

1072
01:34:57,142 --> 01:35:01,841
my brother didn't agree,
he complained to the police,

1073
01:35:02,013 --> 01:35:05,676
that's all, they bashed up
and took away my brother.

1074
01:35:07,819 --> 01:35:13,485
They called us to come with flat
documents if we want him alive.

1075
01:35:13,658 --> 01:35:19,358
They threatened to kill brother
if we go to police.

1076
01:35:19,898 --> 01:35:21,024
Shut up!

1077
01:35:21,299 --> 01:35:24,029
You cried for that already, right?
Why are you crying again for it?

1078
01:35:24,202 --> 01:35:28,195
l said about a Minister we know,
he came back today only,

1079
01:35:28,373 --> 01:35:31,433
to meet him,
l told him about this problem,

1080
01:35:31,609 --> 01:35:36,569
he said you've crossed swords with
big guns and said he can't help us.

1081
01:35:37,048 --> 01:35:41,883
Venkateshwara means my brother.

1082
01:35:43,588 --> 01:35:46,056
Do you've a photo of your brother?
- l do.

1083
01:35:49,961 --> 01:35:53,124
Where's peddanna's den in the city?

1084
01:35:53,298 --> 01:35:55,766
peddanna has many not just one, brother.

1085
01:35:55,934 --> 01:35:59,335
Where are those dens and where
do they keep kidnapped people,

1086
01:35:59,737 --> 01:36:01,227
l want all the details.

1087
01:36:11,916 --> 01:36:12,746
Who are you? What do you want?

1088
01:36:12,917 --> 01:36:14,350
Just 10 minute job, l'll be back.

1089
01:36:14,519 --> 01:36:16,578
Stop there!

1090
01:36:19,491 --> 01:36:22,358
l told you it's just a 10 minute job.

1091
01:36:22,994 --> 01:36:25,428
The tiger has come up from down.

1092
01:36:28,733 --> 01:36:30,758
Who are you?
What do you want?

1093
01:36:30,935 --> 01:36:32,368
Hey shut up! My man is inside.

1094
01:36:32,537 --> 01:36:33,367
l'm here to take him.

1095
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:35,267
l'm telling you, stop there l say.

1096
01:36:47,352 --> 01:36:48,785
Move away, bloody!

1097
01:36:54,859 --> 01:36:57,453
What are you seeing?
The king is here, show!

1098
01:36:57,629 --> 01:36:58,459
Yes brother.

1099
01:36:58,796 --> 01:37:00,127
Who are you?

1100
01:37:07,472 --> 01:37:09,463
Where is he?

1101
01:37:13,478 --> 01:37:15,309
What a grand entry!

1102
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:20,012
Who are you?

1103
01:37:20,185 --> 01:37:22,312
Why bothered about it to get beaten up?

1104
01:37:22,487 --> 01:37:25,479
Hey come, go away.

1105
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:37,768
l beat him, won't l beat you?

1106
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:58,181
You stay little away.
Come on guys!

1107
01:38:09,133 --> 01:38:10,964
You too come.

1108
01:38:11,102 --> 01:38:12,228
You're inviting trouble from peddanna.

1109
01:38:12,403 --> 01:38:13,267
You're finished.

1110
01:38:13,438 --> 01:38:17,340
Who is peddanna? How can he be great
one who kidnaps innocents?

1111
01:38:17,508 --> 01:38:18,941
Who is innocent?

1112
01:38:19,077 --> 01:38:24,709
Kanth was with peddanna and stole
his money Rs.180 crores, bloody thief.

1113
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:13,891
Half of the money is mine,
l'll come back for it in 10 days.

1114
01:39:14,065 --> 01:39:15,259
Tell Nanda.

1115
01:39:15,433 --> 01:39:17,025
Why are you still here after
getting so much money?

1116
01:39:17,168 --> 01:39:18,260
Come to Nanda.

1117
01:39:19,070 --> 01:39:22,130
l know l can't live after
cheating peddanna.

1118
01:39:23,474 --> 01:39:26,102
Nanda attacked us and
took away the money, brother.

1119
01:39:26,277 --> 01:39:30,270
Keep him in our den.
Find Nanda.

1120
01:39:30,448 --> 01:39:44,454
lf what he says is lie, kill him.

1121
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:50,895
Thanks sister.
- No mention.

1122
01:39:51,069 --> 01:39:55,199
Can't l do this for you?
- For me or for money?

1123
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:58,634
But we did it for money only.

1124
01:39:59,310 --> 01:40:01,801
Still not out of the character.

1125
01:40:02,947 --> 01:40:07,816
l managed dialogues well but
had trying times with the hymns.

1126
01:40:07,985 --> 01:40:10,317
l want extra payment for the hymns.

1127
01:40:10,488 --> 01:40:13,218
l too want extra payment.

1128
01:40:13,424 --> 01:40:14,356
Why do you want extra payment?

1129
01:40:14,525 --> 01:40:17,790
paying you is waste,
and you want extra payment too?

1130
01:40:17,962 --> 01:40:20,362
Hey fat boy!
- Calling you only.

1131
01:40:20,531 --> 01:40:23,796
Don't talk about structure
as if you're slim like lleana.

1132
01:40:23,968 --> 01:40:27,233
What did you do?
Just cried all long.

1133
01:40:27,438 --> 01:40:28,837
We did it for you most of the time.

1134
01:40:29,006 --> 01:40:32,669
No need to talk to her, stop the car,
we'll dump her here only.

1135
01:40:32,844 --> 01:40:35,335
What?
- l'll not get down.

1136
01:40:37,782 --> 01:40:38,908
All of you get down.

1137
01:40:39,083 --> 01:40:41,347
What about our payment?
- payment?

1138
01:40:42,019 --> 01:40:44,010
Get down.
- They are crooks.

1139
01:40:44,188 --> 01:40:45,780
We are small time crooks
but they're big time crooks.

1140
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:48,255
She left us on pavement
for asking payment.

1141
01:40:58,536 --> 01:41:02,370
Why feel sorry? l would've done
the same thing in your place.

1142
01:41:03,007 --> 01:41:04,269
Aren't you angry on me?

1143
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:08,502
Why should l? l was looking
around for big money.

1144
01:41:08,679 --> 01:41:10,977
You and your brother
showed me big money.

1145
01:41:11,149 --> 01:41:12,275
lnfact l must thank you.

1146
01:41:12,483 --> 01:41:14,713
You must find us first to get money.

1147
01:41:14,886 --> 01:41:17,446
l'll find.
- lt's impossible.

1148
01:41:17,622 --> 01:41:20,523
The real hard work is in
achieving the impossible.

1149
01:41:20,691 --> 01:41:25,025
The real fun is in having
it the hard way.

1150
01:41:33,037 --> 01:41:37,497
Brother, just came back,
l've a good news for you.

1151
01:41:37,675 --> 01:41:38,733
Where are you?

1152
01:41:39,043 --> 01:41:39,975
How are you doing, brother?

1153
01:41:40,144 --> 01:41:42,476
Nothing to worry, l'm always king.

1154
01:41:42,647 --> 01:41:44,012
Tell me the good news now.

1155
01:41:44,182 --> 01:41:48,414
l'm marrying Shirisha,
we are getting engaged tomorrow.

1156
01:41:52,356 --> 01:41:55,519
Just a wish won't do,
you must personally conduct it.

1157
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:59,424
What's that dress they wear
in North lndian marriages?

1158
01:42:00,331 --> 01:42:04,358
Sherwani! You must wear it and dance.
Have a blast!

1159
01:42:04,569 --> 01:42:07,697
l know you're here to
betray me to peddanna.

1160
01:42:08,105 --> 01:42:09,436
Stop that nonsense.

1161
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:16,810
peddanna called you and
threatened to hand me over to him,

1162
01:42:16,981 --> 01:42:18,312
that's why you're here.

1163
01:42:18,516 --> 01:42:20,450
That's why l like you.

1164
01:42:21,886 --> 01:42:24,320
You brain is very sharp.

1165
01:42:24,489 --> 01:42:28,892
After Bhagawan's death,
peddanna needs me.

1166
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:33,053
l weighed the options who is
more important you or peddanna,

1167
01:42:33,231 --> 01:42:34,664
l favoured peddanna,

1168
01:42:34,832 --> 01:42:36,356
he's coming here now,

1169
01:42:40,037 --> 01:42:43,302
aren't you feeling giddy
on hearing this?

1170
01:42:43,674 --> 01:42:46,575
l'll go out for a haircut GK,
tomorrow is Tuesday.

1171
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:48,473
Sit down brother.

1172
01:42:50,248 --> 01:42:54,981
There's a proverb in English,
the weapon you hold will kill you.

1173
01:43:00,858 --> 01:43:03,292
Gun is in your hand and
in my hand too.

1174
01:43:03,394 --> 01:43:05,487
We both are living.

1175
01:43:05,863 --> 01:43:08,331
l don't care about life.
You do care.

1176
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:12,000
Stop boys!

1177
01:43:15,873 --> 01:43:17,033
Shirisha, come with me.

1178
01:43:19,577 --> 01:43:23,013
Should l be the one to feel giddy?
Shouldn't you feel it? Come.

1179
01:43:40,998 --> 01:43:42,022
Where is he?

1180
01:43:55,112 --> 01:44:00,106
l'm giving you 24 hours, find him,
we'll also try to find him,

1181
01:44:00,284 --> 01:44:02,479
if we don't find him, you'll die

1182
01:44:02,687 --> 01:44:05,212
and if you fail to find him
again you'll die.

1183
01:44:10,027 --> 01:44:11,756
Why is he after us, brother?

1184
01:44:11,929 --> 01:44:16,195
Forget about him, he took away Shirisha.

1185
01:44:16,367 --> 01:44:18,301
He took away Shirisha.

1186
01:44:18,436 --> 01:44:22,839
l don't feel he took her,
l feel she went with him on her own.

1187
01:44:23,608 --> 01:44:25,075
Didn't get it brother?

1188
01:44:25,242 --> 01:44:28,507
Shirisha madam never loved you
and will never do so in life,

1189
01:44:30,181 --> 01:44:32,081
think logically,

1190
01:44:32,249 --> 01:44:34,444
you and her father were
business partners,

1191
01:44:34,619 --> 01:44:36,678
her father didn't like you
and walked out,

1192
01:44:36,854 --> 01:44:42,121
you used intelligence to make
a pauper and left him on streets,

1193
01:44:42,293 --> 01:44:46,423
with an eye on Shirisha, you brought
him back and made a partner again,

1194
01:44:46,597 --> 01:44:49,760
Shirisha isn't so dumb
to overlook this,

1195
01:44:49,934 --> 01:44:54,462
she was with you because of the
heavy loans left by her father,

1196
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:57,870
she was waiting for a man
who could save her,

1197
01:44:58,042 --> 01:45:00,943
she found the man and
walked out with him.

1198
01:45:01,445 --> 01:45:05,279
Next time you tell the truth,
l'll kill you.

1199
01:45:08,919 --> 01:45:10,284
You're over smart in everything,
l'm surprised,

1200
01:45:10,454 --> 01:45:13,389
how could you get cheated
so easily by that girl?

1201
01:45:13,524 --> 01:45:15,458
What's there to get surprised?

1202
01:45:15,626 --> 01:45:18,493
Man uses brain to understand anything,

1203
01:45:18,663 --> 01:45:22,292
but uses eyes to understand a girl.

1204
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,561
Because of that girl, every gang
in the city is after you.

1205
01:45:26,771 --> 01:45:30,571
l'm not angry on her, infact her
smartness is attracting me.

1206
01:45:30,775 --> 01:45:32,834
You're not angry on the girl
who cheated you,

1207
01:45:33,010 --> 01:45:35,308
and you don't like me
who loves you so much.

1208
01:45:35,479 --> 01:45:39,142
Who said l don't like you,
l asked you to come with love only.

1209
01:45:40,017 --> 01:45:42,042
l know why you are with GK,

1210
01:45:42,219 --> 01:45:45,985
you want money and
for that you need Ashtalakshmi.

1211
01:45:46,257 --> 01:45:49,658
When did you start thinking about me?

1212
01:45:51,128 --> 01:45:54,564
Ever since l came to know you're
a chocolate and not a bullet.

1213
01:46:04,475 --> 01:46:08,673
Mesmerizing...

1214
01:46:18,522 --> 01:46:24,324
What have you done to me, Shirisha?

1215
01:46:25,529 --> 01:46:31,468
You've made me fall in love, Shirisha...

1216
01:46:32,136 --> 01:46:36,698
Have you jolted out suddenly
with this mischievous thought...

1217
01:46:36,874 --> 01:46:45,043
Have you come to know slowly now
my wish to be your partner...

1218
01:47:36,767 --> 01:47:38,928
You've made fall with
your chocolate looks...

1219
01:47:39,103 --> 01:47:41,230
You've made me go crazy
left and right...

1220
01:47:41,405 --> 01:47:43,600
You've folded me into your body shape...

1221
01:47:43,774 --> 01:47:46,038
You've shown how crazy
you're on me...

1222
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:48,371
You've put me to sleep
in your heart...

1223
01:47:48,546 --> 01:47:51,014
Oh God, this girl is magical...

1224
01:47:51,182 --> 01:47:55,778
Though l love you and trying to
get attention, you never looked at me...

1225
01:47:55,953 --> 01:48:00,356
But accepted to love
without much fuss today...

1226
01:48:00,524 --> 01:48:05,018
past is different but
the mood is different today...

1227
01:48:05,196 --> 01:48:09,860
l must see the lovely thin
waist up for the grabs...

1228
01:48:10,034 --> 01:48:13,663
My Shirisha, l'm your King...

1229
01:48:13,871 --> 01:48:18,808
Shall l offer myself at
anytime you make a wish?

1230
01:48:18,976 --> 01:48:26,815
Shall l give all my treasured
beauty to you?

1231
01:49:09,693 --> 01:49:14,255
The same eyes are watching me
differently today...

1232
01:49:14,431 --> 01:49:18,765
Do that with me
which it desires...

1233
01:49:18,969 --> 01:49:23,531
Once l like l'll not spare,
l'll fulfill all your wishes...

1234
01:49:23,707 --> 01:49:28,167
l'll not leave it midway,
l'll take it to its logical end...

1235
01:49:28,345 --> 01:49:32,304
My Shirisha, l love you always...

1236
01:49:32,483 --> 01:49:37,284
You're a man of words and action...

1237
01:49:37,454 --> 01:49:45,054
Take me, l'm all yours
now and forever...

1238
01:50:03,580 --> 01:50:04,911
Jewel loot in film style!

1239
01:50:17,661 --> 01:50:19,788
Why are you huffing and puffing on road?

1240
01:50:19,964 --> 01:50:23,525
l'm not, l'm jogging.
My girth has grown.

1241
01:50:23,701 --> 01:50:26,693
Had police caught, they would've reduced it.

1242
01:50:26,837 --> 01:50:28,828
Do you also know the matter?

1243
01:50:29,106 --> 01:50:31,836
Not only me entire state knows it.

1244
01:50:32,977 --> 01:50:35,946
Why are you asking me
though you know it?

1245
01:50:36,413 --> 01:50:39,940
Anyway we all are on road.
How will you catch her?

1246
01:50:40,117 --> 01:50:42,585
lf we use brain we can catch anyone.

1247
01:50:42,753 --> 01:50:43,947
lf Ashtalakshmi was acting,

1248
01:50:44,121 --> 01:50:46,589
then l'm sure her parents
would also be actors.

1249
01:50:46,757 --> 01:50:49,157
lf we can catch them,
we can catch Ashtalakshmi.

1250
01:50:54,331 --> 01:50:56,231
That fat boy...that Narayana...

1251
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,459
l saw him playing drama
in Ravindra Bharathi.

1252
01:50:59,470 --> 01:51:01,495
l'll give the number, you take down.

1253
01:51:01,972 --> 01:51:03,963
They're acting in films now.

1254
01:51:04,842 --> 01:51:06,139
The boy is giving a shot.

1255
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:07,971
Where's the film shoot going on?

1256
01:51:11,982 --> 01:51:16,146
There are lots of week end
players in this world.

1257
01:51:18,255 --> 01:51:21,486
And they changed colours
like chameleons.

1258
01:51:24,428 --> 01:51:26,988
And they eat grass to earn money.

1259
01:51:27,164 --> 01:51:28,825
Green grass people!

1260
01:51:30,534 --> 01:51:32,502
And they are sinners!

1261
01:51:34,371 --> 01:51:36,430
God forgive them.

1262
01:51:37,708 --> 01:51:39,505
Don't punish them.

1263
01:51:41,845 --> 01:51:44,006
And they don't know
what they are doing.

1264
01:51:46,417 --> 01:51:48,248
l don't know anything....
l don't know anything...

1265
01:51:48,419 --> 01:51:49,716
They don't know anything.

1266
01:51:49,887 --> 01:51:51,616
l don't know anything sir.

1267
01:51:51,889 --> 01:51:53,379
lt's they don't know anything.

1268
01:51:53,557 --> 01:51:56,151
please see them and say that.

1269
01:51:56,326 --> 01:51:58,521
Who?
- They!

1270
01:52:01,065 --> 01:52:02,293
l too don't know anything.

1271
01:52:02,466 --> 01:52:04,195
l too don't know anything,
l'm innocent.

1272
01:52:04,368 --> 01:52:06,859
l too don't know anything.

1273
01:52:11,442 --> 01:52:14,411
l'm coming father...coming...coming.

1274
01:52:19,083 --> 01:52:21,051
Why did you stop?

1275
01:52:22,753 --> 01:52:24,687
We can't run anymore.

1276
01:52:27,357 --> 01:52:30,053
We get tired and will be easily caught.

1277
01:52:31,328 --> 01:52:32,920
So we stopped here.

1278
01:52:33,097 --> 01:52:34,894
That's okay, where's Ashtalakshmi?

1279
01:52:35,933 --> 01:52:36,900
We don't know.

1280
01:52:37,067 --> 01:52:39,729
Will you hit with jug in the
name of curse? My head got cracked.

1281
01:52:39,903 --> 01:52:41,734
You shut up.
- You keep shut.

1282
01:52:43,907 --> 01:52:45,465
You said you'll not beat women, right?

1283
01:52:45,642 --> 01:52:47,735
lf anyone irritates me,
l'll beat even women.

1284
01:52:48,912 --> 01:52:50,311
Did you hear that? He'll beat even
women if they irritate him.

1285
01:52:50,481 --> 01:52:51,971
Don't get me involved in it.

1286
01:52:52,282 --> 01:52:53,749
You tell me.

1287
01:52:55,519 --> 01:52:57,919
We really don't know.

1288
01:53:02,526 --> 01:53:03,686
Why did you beat me now?

1289
01:53:03,961 --> 01:53:06,088
l remembered about you
irritating me earlier.

1290
01:53:06,263 --> 01:53:07,287
How many times will you
beat me for that?

1291
01:53:07,464 --> 01:53:09,591
How many times you'd irritated me?

1292
01:53:12,970 --> 01:53:15,996
Many times.
- Then l'll beat you many times.

1293
01:53:21,445 --> 01:53:24,005
We know her flat address.

1294
01:53:40,364 --> 01:53:42,958
l found it.
- Got her address?

1295
01:53:48,305 --> 01:53:49,567
Tell me how can l help you?

1296
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:52,402
Don't do anything, stay like that
l'll watch you for sometime.

1297
01:53:52,576 --> 01:53:53,338
Why do you want to watch me?

1298
01:53:53,510 --> 01:53:56,138
Why do we admire a beautiful Bapu drawing?

1299
01:53:57,181 --> 01:53:58,307
For happiness.

1300
01:53:59,516 --> 01:54:00,642
Who is that girl?

1301
01:54:00,851 --> 01:54:01,545
Why did you ask me that?

1302
01:54:01,718 --> 01:54:04,812
She was looking at you angrily
when you praised me.

1303
01:54:05,155 --> 01:54:08,647
Girls are like that they can't stand
anyone more beautiful than themselves.

1304
01:54:11,728 --> 01:54:15,755
You're praising me so much means
you want me to do something out of way.

1305
01:54:15,999 --> 01:54:17,023
You can do it easily.

1306
01:54:17,234 --> 01:54:19,429
This is credit card account number.

1307
01:54:19,603 --> 01:54:21,332
l want to know where was
it's last transaction?

1308
01:54:21,705 --> 01:54:23,172
Whose account is that?

1309
01:54:23,574 --> 01:54:24,768
His daughter's!

1310
01:54:25,175 --> 01:54:26,836
ls that cheat my daughter?

1311
01:54:28,045 --> 01:54:30,172
How can you deny she's your daughter
just because she had eloped?

1312
01:54:30,347 --> 01:54:33,009
Correct, she's my daughter.

1313
01:54:36,019 --> 01:54:37,043
What's her name?

1314
01:54:37,221 --> 01:54:38,449
What's in the details?

1315
01:54:39,189 --> 01:54:42,215
l've studied MBA not elementary school.

1316
01:54:42,392 --> 01:54:44,883
Small correction,
she's not his daughter.

1317
01:54:45,062 --> 01:54:45,687
Daughter-in-law!

1318
01:54:46,196 --> 01:54:48,528
Earlier daughter now daughter-in-law.

1319
01:54:48,699 --> 01:54:52,191
That girl eloped with his son,

1320
01:54:52,369 --> 01:54:55,304
he had an heart attack recently
and got sense,

1321
01:54:55,472 --> 01:54:58,441
and thought of bringing back son
and daughter-in-law to home, right?

1322
01:54:58,609 --> 01:55:01,373
You're perfectly right,
he's absolutely right.

1323
01:55:01,545 --> 01:55:05,379
ls it true?
- Would l dare lie to you?

1324
01:55:10,387 --> 01:55:13,550
Last transaction was in
Bangkok Hotel Royal Cliff.

1325
01:55:20,097 --> 01:55:23,828
Failed to catch a lone
outsider in our city.

1326
01:55:25,569 --> 01:55:28,231
GK, the time l gave you is over.

1327
01:55:28,939 --> 01:55:31,806
That's why l'm here.
Not only you, l too want him.

1328
01:55:31,975 --> 01:55:35,467
l desired her since my early youth days,

1329
01:55:35,646 --> 01:55:38,240
that bastard took her away.

1330
01:55:40,117 --> 01:55:47,080
Who wants your silly love story?
l want him!

1331
01:55:47,257 --> 01:55:50,420
lf we want him, we mustn't go
in search of him,

1332
01:55:50,594 --> 01:55:53,085
let's do something to make
him come to us.

1333
01:55:53,263 --> 01:55:54,321
Why would he come to us?

1334
01:55:54,498 --> 01:56:00,095
Let's find his family and kidnap them,
he'll come to us on his own.

1335
01:56:00,270 --> 01:56:02,932
Go boys.

1336
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:09,044
Anyone related him must
be here by tomorrow.

1337
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:12,440
Bangkok

1338
01:56:13,183 --> 01:56:16,949
Brahmam, use your English knowledge
and take us to the hotel.

1339
01:56:20,424 --> 01:56:22,517
What's this man?
You've changed the style.

1340
01:56:22,693 --> 01:56:24,320
place changed,
so l changed my style.

1341
01:56:24,494 --> 01:56:25,859
That was lndia,
l was wanted criminal,

1342
01:56:26,029 --> 01:56:28,190
this is Bangkok,
nobody can dare touch me here.

1343
01:56:28,398 --> 01:56:29,797
ls that your courage?

1344
01:56:35,138 --> 01:56:36,127
Not him!

1345
01:56:41,845 --> 01:56:44,746
Though l said it's not you,
he beat you.

1346
01:56:44,915 --> 01:56:46,883
His punch is also not hurting me

1347
01:56:47,050 --> 01:56:50,679
but your Rayalaseema accent
is hurting me more.

1348
01:56:50,854 --> 01:56:53,152
Where is it hurting? Here?

1349
01:57:01,264 --> 01:57:03,596
He's speaking English very well.
- Don't involve me in it.

1350
01:57:03,767 --> 01:57:05,325
Won't you get involved in this too?

1351
01:57:48,111 --> 01:57:50,443
You can't run with those
high heels, come here.

1352
01:57:59,990 --> 01:58:01,981
Are you saying sorry
after doing everything?

1353
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:03,387
Bloody cheat.

1354
01:58:05,128 --> 01:58:07,926
You should be getting angry me,
why is she furious?

1355
01:58:08,098 --> 01:58:09,497
Why are you getting infuriated?

1356
01:58:09,766 --> 01:58:11,495
Aren't you angry on her?

1357
01:58:11,668 --> 01:58:12,965
She said sorry, right?

1358
01:58:13,136 --> 01:58:14,467
Will you forgive her for a sorry?

1359
01:58:14,638 --> 01:58:16,230
Tell me what do you want me to do?

1360
01:58:18,175 --> 01:58:19,574
She's your friend, right?

1361
01:58:25,348 --> 01:58:27,407
You're the one who directs her
from behind the screen, right?

1362
01:58:28,351 --> 01:58:29,750
How can she be my friend?

1363
01:58:30,153 --> 01:58:31,586
How can she be my friend?

1364
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:38,591
We are caught, leave it.

1365
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:44,326
Are you both friends?

1366
01:58:44,534 --> 01:58:46,832
You keep quiet, how did you find it?

1367
01:58:47,437 --> 01:58:49,769
Your elder brother stole money
and got caught,

1368
01:58:49,940 --> 01:58:51,464
and told about this to Shirisha,

1369
01:58:51,641 --> 01:58:53,268
Shirisha told you about me,

1370
01:58:53,443 --> 01:58:55,502
and introduced you as
chocolate in the scene,

1371
01:58:55,679 --> 01:58:59,046
and got your brother freed by me,
am l right?

1372
01:59:00,050 --> 01:59:03,952
l wanted to ask you straight but
got confused seeing your smartness.

1373
01:59:04,120 --> 01:59:06,680
But you haven't told us
how you found us out?

1374
01:59:06,857 --> 01:59:10,793
By seeing the tattoo on your back
in our first meeting.

1375
01:59:17,267 --> 01:59:19,326
Later on l saw you both
talking to each other in pub.

1376
01:59:19,503 --> 01:59:22,472
Why are you here?
- lf he sees. we'll be in trouble.

1377
01:59:24,274 --> 01:59:25,969
Don't worry.

1378
01:59:29,513 --> 01:59:32,482
Before all this l saw the photo
of you both together in your room.

1379
01:59:43,426 --> 01:59:46,589
Why did you keep quiet knowing all this?
- l wanted to know the truth.

1380
01:59:46,763 --> 01:59:50,722
The moment you showed me your brother,
l knew it's about Rs.180 crores.

1381
01:59:50,901 --> 01:59:52,698
That's why l got him out.

1382
01:59:52,869 --> 01:59:55,429
We got you out with great difficulty
and yet you cheated me.

1383
01:59:55,639 --> 01:59:57,231
Without giving my share.

1384
01:59:57,374 --> 02:00:00,639
Nanda didn't give us our share
to give you your share.

1385
02:00:00,810 --> 02:00:01,970
l told you but you didn't listen to me.

1386
02:00:02,145 --> 02:00:03,840
We came here to meet Nanda.

1387
02:00:04,014 --> 02:00:06,141
Nanda? Who is he?

1388
02:00:06,316 --> 02:00:08,614
Your fight gave me an opportunity.

1389
02:00:08,785 --> 02:00:11,413
l knew you'd give me a clue
to find them.

1390
02:00:11,621 --> 02:00:13,145
That's why l got you to
come out with truth.

1391
02:00:13,323 --> 02:00:15,052
That fat boy...that Narayana...

1392
02:00:15,225 --> 02:00:17,386
l saw him playing drama
in Ravindra Bharathi.

1393
02:00:20,230 --> 02:00:23,688
We thought it was our plan,
but no it was yours.

1394
02:00:24,334 --> 02:00:27,030
How many plans l may have drawn,
one thing is true,

1395
02:00:27,971 --> 02:00:29,370
l love you.

1396
02:00:30,674 --> 02:00:33,404
Shut up! Darling?

1397
02:00:33,577 --> 02:00:35,044
What's your age and her age?

1398
02:00:36,012 --> 02:00:39,140
Stomach is protruding outside,
head has tuned bald,

1399
02:00:39,916 --> 02:00:42,612
you need to use a ladder
to catch up with her.

1400
02:00:46,256 --> 02:00:51,387
l thought you planned everything,
she had planned it behind you,

1401
02:00:51,561 --> 02:00:55,361
l thought you both had planned it
but he had planned it before you both,

1402
02:00:55,498 --> 02:00:58,092
she loves him from the beginning,

1403
02:00:58,268 --> 02:01:01,169
l was the joker in between,
my damn fate.

1404
02:01:02,238 --> 02:01:04,604
Darling? please don't call me like that.

1405
02:01:04,774 --> 02:01:07,106
l don't want to hear the
word darling in my life.

1406
02:01:07,277 --> 02:01:09,575
You keep quiet.

1407
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:11,742
Where is your brother?

1408
02:01:21,591 --> 02:01:22,580
Life!

1409
02:01:22,892 --> 02:01:24,860
Everybody is beating like
ringing bell in temple.

1410
02:01:25,028 --> 02:01:26,427
Where is that Kadapa man's family?

1411
02:01:26,596 --> 02:01:28,359
Who has hired you as goons?

1412
02:01:28,498 --> 02:01:31,092
Where will be Kadapa man's family?
ln Kadapa only.

1413
02:01:31,835 --> 02:01:33,268
Where in Kadapa?

1414
02:01:35,071 --> 02:01:36,095
Look there!

1415
02:01:41,945 --> 02:01:44,778
Nanda has cheated me,
he's not giving me my share too.

1416
02:01:44,948 --> 02:01:48,111
He doesn't have the money to give you.

1417
02:01:52,155 --> 02:01:54,350
Never expected we'll get
so much money so easily.

1418
02:01:55,525 --> 02:01:57,117
l too didn't expect this.

1419
02:02:02,232 --> 02:02:03,631
Where is Nanda?

1420
02:02:06,670 --> 02:02:08,069
This is another twist.

1421
02:02:08,972 --> 02:02:11,634
Aren't you here for money?
- No!

1422
02:02:11,875 --> 02:02:13,172
l'm here for Nanda.

1423
02:02:14,244 --> 02:02:16,474
Only he knows Nanda's place.

1424
02:02:17,113 --> 02:02:19,809
That's why l got him out
from peddanna's den.

1425
02:02:20,517 --> 02:02:24,715
Oh God! He's no ordinary man!

1426
02:02:24,888 --> 02:02:26,253
Tell me, where is he?

1427
02:02:28,692 --> 02:02:30,489
Why are you after Nanda?

1428
02:02:40,704 --> 02:02:43,502
Where's Dr.Nirmala?

1429
02:02:56,286 --> 02:02:58,846
Sir!
- What? Found his mother?

1430
02:02:59,022 --> 02:03:01,582
His mother died recently sir.

1431
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:03,019
lt seems you got her killed.

1432
02:03:03,693 --> 02:03:04,853
Did l got her killed?

1433
02:03:25,248 --> 02:03:27,842
Uncle pothi Reddy is here to meet you.

1434
02:03:28,017 --> 02:03:30,212
Devendra, tomorrow my daughter
is getting engaged.

1435
02:03:30,386 --> 02:03:31,751
l'm here to invite you.

1436
02:03:31,921 --> 02:03:33,354
l know you'll not come out of home.

1437
02:03:33,523 --> 02:03:34,956
But l've to invite you
for courtesy, right?

1438
02:03:35,125 --> 02:03:36,649
That's why l'm here.

1439
02:03:38,161 --> 02:03:40,721
What's that dirty shirt?
Change it.

1440
02:03:40,797 --> 02:03:42,822
Aren't you satisfied with
the lost honour?

1441
02:03:46,002 --> 02:03:46,559
Go!

1442
02:03:47,203 --> 02:03:49,330
l'll go, would l stay here only?

1443
02:03:49,506 --> 02:03:50,905
Come, what are you watching?

1444
02:03:54,210 --> 02:03:56,610
Can't wait anymore,
make a call to Hyderabad.

1445
02:03:56,780 --> 02:03:58,247
Call peddanna.

1446
02:04:02,585 --> 02:04:03,415
No!

1447
02:04:05,388 --> 02:04:09,256
Brother will get angry for calling him
for such a trivial thing.

1448
02:04:09,425 --> 02:04:11,620
This is not trivial
but really very big.

1449
02:04:11,795 --> 02:04:13,660
Only peddanna can do it.

1450
02:04:16,065 --> 02:04:16,929
Hold on the line.

1451
02:04:17,233 --> 02:04:18,257
Devendra's phone.

1452
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:22,929
What man? How are you?

1453
02:04:23,106 --> 02:04:24,437
We are not fine, brother-in-law.

1454
02:04:31,981 --> 02:04:34,677
Unable to tackle one man,
are you complaining to me?

1455
02:04:39,689 --> 02:04:42,954
Brother, don't underestimate him,

1456
02:04:43,793 --> 02:04:45,226
you don't know his power, brother.

1457
02:04:45,395 --> 02:04:47,727
Bloody cowards!

1458
02:04:48,798 --> 02:04:51,323
He'll not be alive
tomorrow by this time.

1459
02:04:51,501 --> 02:04:53,799
l don't know if he lives or not,
but l'll not be there.

1460
02:04:53,970 --> 02:04:56,461
l'm going to our Bangalore
guest house...

1461
02:04:57,640 --> 02:05:00,473
For daring to touch his mother,

1462
02:05:00,643 --> 02:05:05,637
it seems he tore my brother's
clothes in public and beat him.

1463
02:05:06,516 --> 02:05:11,818
l'll not kill him,
l'll kill his mother in public.

1464
02:05:12,956 --> 02:05:15,982
l'll see what can he do.

1465
02:05:37,113 --> 02:05:39,843
Where's Dr.Nirmala?
- She's in Op.

1466
02:05:50,393 --> 02:05:51,189
Mother!

1467
02:05:58,635 --> 02:06:01,866
Somebody is trying to kill mother,
let's save her life.

1468
02:06:08,978 --> 02:06:12,209
Come mother, you go inside.
Don't come out.

1469
02:06:54,724 --> 02:06:57,352
lnnocent people are dying for me.

1470
02:06:57,527 --> 02:07:00,428
please listen to me, mother,
please don't go out.

1471
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:05,929
please mother, don't go out.

1472
02:07:06,469 --> 02:07:07,436
Mother!

1473
02:07:16,946 --> 02:07:27,686
Mother!

1474
02:07:34,030 --> 02:07:34,860
Mother!

1475
02:08:11,034 --> 02:08:12,262
Brother!

1476
02:08:33,456 --> 02:08:36,857
Mother, l'll run the hospital
as you were running it.

1477
02:08:37,026 --> 02:08:40,359
But l'll kill the people who killed you.

1478
02:08:54,043 --> 02:08:56,034
He entered the city coolly.

1479
02:09:02,952 --> 02:09:04,886
Killed Jairam and Bhagawan.

1480
02:09:09,525 --> 02:09:13,985
lf my guess is right,
he'd be on the way to kill Nanda now.

1481
02:09:17,266 --> 02:09:18,062
Stop!

1482
02:09:18,501 --> 02:09:19,900
l'm telling you with
my past experience.

1483
02:09:20,069 --> 02:09:21,661
it's not safe for us
to get out of car.

1484
02:09:55,338 --> 02:09:58,432
Nanda! Come out!

1485
02:09:59,008 --> 02:10:01,101
Your death has come searching you.

1486
02:10:05,014 --> 02:10:08,211
Did peddanna send you?
- No, God sent me here.

1487
02:10:08,384 --> 02:10:10,784
To avenge killing of Dr.Nirmala.

1488
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:20,128
l enjoyed so much that day,
today l'll enjoy killing you.

1489
02:11:25,895 --> 02:11:29,194
l think you're his next target.

1490
02:11:30,900 --> 02:11:34,700
Am l his target? He's my target.

1491
02:11:49,218 --> 02:11:53,211
All this will to go anyone
who suggests an idea to kill him.

1492
02:11:53,889 --> 02:11:56,221
Let's get Dawood's gang
from Bombay, brother.

1493
02:11:56,859 --> 02:11:59,054
There's a sharp shooter
in Chennai, brother.

1494
02:11:59,862 --> 02:12:01,591
Leave everything and
escape to Dubai.

1495
02:12:03,232 --> 02:12:06,395
Even peddanna couldn't find Nanda,
but he traced and killed him.

1496
02:12:06,936 --> 02:12:08,233
You're nothing to him, brother.

1497
02:12:08,804 --> 02:12:09,736
Come closer.

1498
02:12:25,855 --> 02:12:27,516
lf l had hurt you...

1499
02:12:30,426 --> 02:12:31,916
You're an intelligent girl,

1500
02:12:32,161 --> 02:12:34,994
though you don't do good,
please don't do anything bad.

1501
02:12:39,635 --> 02:12:41,034
lsn't there anything for me?

1502
02:12:41,404 --> 02:12:43,872
please tell something to her also.

1503
02:12:44,140 --> 02:12:46,005
l'm telling you also the
same that l told her.

1504
02:12:46,842 --> 02:12:51,438
l'd to do this to settle
my father's debts.

1505
02:12:51,647 --> 02:12:52,614
Right sir.

1506
02:12:54,150 --> 02:12:57,586
l'm accepting shamelessly,
l can't live without you.

1507
02:12:57,753 --> 02:13:01,450
Right sir.
Look at her tears sir.

1508
02:13:01,991 --> 02:13:04,892
You can't come along with me,
you'll find it very difficult.

1509
02:13:05,761 --> 02:13:07,626
l'm ready to face any difficulty.

1510
02:13:07,797 --> 02:13:10,789
Look at the desperation in her voice.

1511
02:13:11,701 --> 02:13:14,135
But l'm not ready to
put your life in difficulties.

1512
02:13:20,509 --> 02:13:22,374
l'll definitely come back for you.

1513
02:13:45,701 --> 02:13:48,363
Hey girl...apple..

1514
02:13:48,537 --> 02:13:51,768
Who is the dream boy who came
into your dream to shake up?

1515
02:13:51,941 --> 02:13:54,535
That we're a new couple...couple...

1516
02:13:54,710 --> 02:13:57,178
That we're on a honeymoon...
- ls it so?

1517
02:13:57,346 --> 02:14:03,285
Hey girl! What else had happened
in that dream?

1518
02:14:03,486 --> 02:14:05,613
That we've had a baby boy...

1519
02:14:06,222 --> 02:14:08,520
That he went around in shorts...

1520
02:14:08,924 --> 02:14:11,449
You're a modern girl in jeans and
ferocious like Queen of Jhansi...

1521
02:14:11,627 --> 02:14:14,391
How come you've taken
the path of romance?

1522
02:14:14,563 --> 02:14:20,195
Handsome man like you with glamour
is attracting me like magnet...

1523
02:14:20,369 --> 02:14:26,069
Now that you're here, l'll spread
red carpet direct into my arms...

1524
02:14:26,242 --> 02:14:32,203
Now that you're so close, l'll put
green signal to enter my heart...

1525
02:15:27,436 --> 02:15:30,166
When we both become one
before fate...

1526
02:15:30,306 --> 02:15:33,104
Why to delay it further our union?

1527
02:15:33,275 --> 02:15:36,005
put a dot on my cheek and
tie the knot with me...

1528
02:15:36,178 --> 02:15:38,544
l'll serve you with
betel leaf and nuts...

1529
02:15:38,714 --> 02:15:44,482
Okay right, come with me,
l'll marry you at the earliest...

1530
02:15:44,653 --> 02:15:51,115
Engagement or whatever it is,
let's have it right now here...

1531
02:16:31,433 --> 02:16:37,065
Though expensive, l'll book
a flat for us in Gachibowli...

1532
02:16:37,239 --> 02:16:42,677
l'll set up a place for you where
light can't reach in day time also...

1533
02:16:42,845 --> 02:16:48,340
Your kisses are breakfast, meals,
drinks, juices, fruits and nuts to me...

1534
02:16:48,517 --> 02:16:55,013
What a chance! Lovely dose!
This is the day to seek pleasures...

1535
02:17:31,894 --> 02:17:37,764
peddanna, l killed everyone who was
involved in killing my mother,

1536
02:17:37,933 --> 02:17:39,730
the only one remaining is you,

1537
02:17:40,569 --> 02:17:44,403
where ever you may be,
you'll meet a dog's death.

1538
02:17:44,573 --> 02:17:45,733
Brother!

1539
02:17:46,575 --> 02:17:51,911
Hey Sathya Reddy! l'm waiting
near your mother's grave.

1540
02:17:52,615 --> 02:17:54,242
Do you know why l'm here?

1541
02:17:54,950 --> 02:18:00,115
To bury you and your sister
near that grave.

1542
02:18:01,757 --> 02:18:04,021
What a great horoscope you have!

1543
02:18:04,193 --> 02:18:07,219
You weren't there
when your mother was killed,

1544
02:18:07,396 --> 02:18:12,333
now when l'm killing your sister,
you're not here.

1545
02:18:12,468 --> 02:18:17,462
Kill and bury her
before he comes here.

1546
02:18:18,540 --> 02:18:19,598
Brother!

1547

He came to know l'm in Bangalore.

1549
02:18:27,383 --> 02:18:31,217
Before we make a move,
he'll make 10 counter moves.

1550
02:18:31,820 --> 02:18:36,257
What a great horoscope you have!

1551
02:18:36,425 --> 02:18:38,450
l was waiting to kill you,

1552
02:18:38,627 --> 02:18:41,118
but you booked a good place
and time for your death.

1553
02:18:41,296 --> 02:18:43,787
Who are you man?

1554
02:18:43,966 --> 02:18:48,164
l'm the most feared and
you're scaring me.

1555
02:18:48,337 --> 02:18:49,395
Who are you l say?

1556
02:18:49,538 --> 02:18:54,407
Did you ever get the thought
why did l pick up trouble from him?

1557
02:18:54,543 --> 02:18:55,475
l'm that man!

1558
02:18:55,644 --> 02:19:02,743
Come, l want to see the man
who has disturbed me so much.

1559
02:19:02,918 --> 02:19:07,014
l'm coming,
l'll save my sister like man,

1560
02:19:07,189 --> 02:19:10,181

and your brother.

1561
02:19:10,359 --> 02:19:14,489
Come...come...come...

1563
02:19:44,226 --> 02:19:46,956
Sister, you don't get tensed.

1564
02:19:47,129 --> 02:19:49,120
Let's have lunch together
in 30 minutes after killing him.

1565
02:19:49,298 --> 02:19:52,062
Were you the man who played with me?

1566
02:19:52,234 --> 02:19:55,328
Brother, don't underestimate him.

1567
02:19:55,504 --> 02:20:01,704
He appears handsome like a hero
but his punches are rock hard.

1568
02:20:01,877 --> 02:20:05,142
He's alone, what the hell can he do?

1569
02:20:05,314 --> 02:20:10,843
lfjustice is on his side,
even one man is equal to 100 men.

1570
02:20:11,019 --> 02:20:13,817
Look at the people behind me.

1571
02:20:13,989 --> 02:20:15,616
My power!

1572

lf you've power, l've pride.

1573
02:20:20,229 --> 02:20:23,824
lf you've weapon, l've courage.

1574
02:20:23,999 --> 02:20:26,832
You're coming forward,
what makes you dare so much?

1575
02:20:27,002 --> 02:20:29,630
Courage to a man who wants
to avenge mother's murder,

1576
02:20:29,838 --> 02:20:33,831
taking risk to save a sister's life,
it'll come naturally to any man.

1577
02:20:34,009 --> 02:20:39,072
Boys go, kill him and bring my brother.

1578
02:21:14,416 --> 02:21:19,046
l'll meet you in few minutes
and show you hell.

1579
02:21:19,221 --> 02:21:24,784
When you see hell after death,
you'll feel you'd seen worse on earth.

1580
02:21:52,421 --> 02:21:54,480
Brother...brother...

1581
02:22:41,937 --> 02:22:43,029

as he watches.

1585
02:23:16,104 --> 02:23:18,504
l'll bring back your lost courage.

1586
02:23:18,740 --> 02:23:21,903
Come...come...come...

1587
02:23:30,619 --> 02:23:35,079
To kill my sister,
you must first kill me.

1588
02:23:35,757 --> 02:23:36,416
Come!
