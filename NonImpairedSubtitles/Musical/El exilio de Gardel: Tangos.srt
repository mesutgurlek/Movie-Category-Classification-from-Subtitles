THE EXILE OF GARDEL - TANGOS

2
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,555
For my parents

3
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,110
<i>We're going to present</i>

4
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,710
<i>Quite simply</i>

5
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,876
<i>Quite simply</i>

6
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:33,633
<i>The tangos of the exile of Gardel</i>

7
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,033
<i>Just as they are</i>

8
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,313
<i>We're going to tell you</i>

9
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,031
<i>Quite simply</i>

10
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,756
<i>As a start</i>

11
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:55,798
<i>The tangos of our little dramas</i>

12
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,077
<i>The tangos of the exile of Gardel</i>

13
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,034
<i>Are tangos written with our flesh</i>

14
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,073
<i>A topical "Tango-dy" still up to date</i>

15
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,876
<i>I'm Maria.</i>
<i>I've just turned 20.</i>

16
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,077
<i>I arrived from Buenos Aires</i>
<i>with my mother 8 years ago.</i>

17
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,670
<i>And I'm still here.</i>

18
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,559
<i>That's probably why I need to tell you</i>

19
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,752
<i>what we and her friends</i>
<i>have lived through in Paris.</i>

20
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,239
<i>The capital of all exiles,</i>
<i>miracles and misery.</i>

21
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,635
<i>The story of the "Exile of Gardel"</i>

22
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,037
<i>began in a suburban home</i>
<i>for refugees and immigrants.</i>

23
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,635
<i>It was called "Río de la Plata" as many</i>
<i>Argentines and Uruguayans lived there.</i>

24
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,275
<i>There was Gerardo.</i>

25
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,150
<i>A writer-professor friend</i>
<i>of Papa's who helped us a lot.</i>

26
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,278
<i>Poor man! When he renewed his passport,</i>
<i>the consulate made him</i>

27
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,311
<i>shave his beard off.</i>

28
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,317
I asked for refugee status.

29
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,958
I didn't want to cause trouble.
But this is too much!

30
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,636
They can go to hell!
I'll have a beard!

31
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,311
Down to here! Like Valle Inclán
or Martín Fierro!

32
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,393
<i>El Negro and Susana also lived there.</i>

33
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,158
<i>He was a lawyer and bass player.</i>

34
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,715
<i>They were expecting their first child.</i>

35
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,195
<i>Miseria was a Uruguayan musician.</i>

36
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,198
<i>Everyone adored him.</i>

37
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,437
<i>He knew how to use</i>
<i>a public phone for free.</i>

38
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,637
Who screws up the phones?
It's impossible to call from here!

39
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,588
<i>Alicia was the ex-wife of Juan Dos.</i>

40
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,390
<i>She'd just arrived with their children</i>
<i>Manuela and Carlitos.</i>

41
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,994
<i>Juan Dos...</i>

42
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,312
<i>... a composer</i>
<i>and Mama's lover.</i>

43
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,433
<i>He'd formed a quintet</i>
<i>and convinced his pianist Angel,</i>

44
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,877
<i>also a choreographer,</i>
<i>to help stage the Tango-Dy,</i>

45
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,831
<i>which, said he, was the greatest</i>
<i>tango opus ever written.</i>

46
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,112
I don't now how,
but I'll do it.

47
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,993
Pardon me, Maestro.

48
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,916
Joker!

49
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,834
<i>We'll continue our story</i>

50
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,156
<i>Our song</i>

51
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,752
<i>By entering the Exile of Gardel...</i>

52
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,911
<i>Thus, without realising it</i>

53
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:26,189
<i>they had begun to live a real dog's life</i>
<i>in the City of Lights.</i>

54
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,956
<i>And there was Mariana,</i>
<i>the Tango-dy's star...</i>

55
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,674
<i>Divine...</i>

56
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,029
<i>Unbearable...</i>
<i>my mother.</i>

57
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,029
Are you there?

58
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,153
No one came for the kids?

59
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,229
I don't like to see them
all over the flat.

60
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,472
Turn the music down
when I talk to you!

61
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,911
Leave me alone!

62
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,671
Seen my briefcase?

63
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,157
I'm fed up!

64
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,794
- You must've mislaid it.
- Don't be sassy!

65
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,070
The bank rang:
You're overdrawn.

66
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,591
My account?
What did you tell them?

67
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,155
Nothing. They want you to phone.

68
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,997
Come on, kids...

69
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,994
Still phoning that boy, Cool?

70
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,070
A 1,800 franc phone bill!

71
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,479
- Cool lives in Lille.
- You call Buenos Aires!

72
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,153
Don't talk nonsense!

73
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,989
I'm taking 20 francs.
I'll sleep at Teresa's.

74
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,428
We're rehearsing late.
They're waiting for me...

75
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,355
- Skipping school again?
- It's the last time, I promise!

76
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,475
Grandma sends you money
for your schooling and you don't study!

77
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,477
Please don't exaggerate!
That's enough!

78
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,551
Enough? I make sacrifices
like a fool and you do nothing,

79
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,469
absolutely nothing about your diploma!

80
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,908
What good it'll do me?

81
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,390
I'll phone later.
Have a nice evening!

82
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,154
MISERIA IN PARIS

83
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:48,869
<i>At the station we'll find</i>

84
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,315
<i>The heroes of the Exile of Gardel.</i>

85
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,868
Form a line, or we'll get caught!

86
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,832
Now dial long distance.

87
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,196
No, I need change!

88
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,430
- Where'd you call?
- Montevideo, last night.

89
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,119
Who told you how to do it?

90
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,675
An English girl, a model.

91
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,872
A model! I need change!
Fix it!

92
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,109
10 people are freezing to death.
Miseria, hurry up!

93
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,553
Fix it!

94
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,477
- How long will it take?
- No idea!

95
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,751
Why not simply use coins?

96
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,310
Miseria! Miserable!

97
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,112
Never mind, Gerardo,
we'll have our pizzeria.

98
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,511
Sure, Juan's mama is bringing
the dollars in cash.

99
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,717
A Lebanese...

100
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,233
from Goteborg taught me this trick.
It's simple.

101
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,953
Pick up the receiver.

102
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,070
I make contact and cut the dial tone.

103
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,549
You didn't cut a thing!

104
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,111
It's the same dial tone!

105
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,316
Careful... the line...

106
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,194
If you keep smoking,
you'll burn up your lungs.

107
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,231
Yes, everything'll burn.

108
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,672
All my books...
everything I have.

109
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,951
He's not allowed to smoke!

110
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,872
What's wrong, Gerardo?

111
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,913
Everything, my dear.

112
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,399
We've lost my house, my daughter,
my books, my archives. 20 years of work.

113
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,032
Don't exaggerate!
They haven't burnt anything yet.

114
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,590
2,000 books.
What'll they do with them?

115
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,633
Bury them? Destroy them?
They'll burn them!

116
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,511
You'll talk to them
on the phone.

117
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,877
The brother-in-law is to sell the house
and empty it out.

118
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,672
Can't they be stored elsewhere?

119
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,270
2,000 books? Where?

120
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,635
No one'll dare touch them.
They're afraid. They'll burn them.

121
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,512
I'll go get them.

122
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,389
We've already discussed it.

123
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,716
- I said I'll go!
- Don't be stubborn!

124
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,957
Don't yell.
Besides, the mothers expect me.

125
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,630
<i>I'd hoped to enjoy my old age</i>
<i>by doing nothing,</i>

126
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,753
<i>not caring about obligations</i>

127
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,635
<i>and devoting myself to creativity.</i>

128
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,108
<i>But no...</i>

129
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,918
<i>I had to accept this job</i>
<i>as a guard at the Trade Center.</i>

130
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,319
<i>Since they locked up my daughter Marta</i>
<i>and her family,</i>

131
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,148
<i>my wife and I have endured</i>
<i>the worst ordeals,</i>

132
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,794
<i>dangers and misfortunes.</i>

133
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,950
<i>These notes are also meant</i>
<i>to evoke the memory of San Martín</i>

134
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,632
<i>and the exile of the great</i>
<i>unfinished nation.</i>

135
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:34,398
<i>Latin American people have lived</i>
<i>in exile inside as well as outside,</i>

136
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,798
<i>always under the hold</i>
<i>of neo-colonial power.</i>

137
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,154
Yes, Mama.

138
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,639
My best wishes!

139
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,153
From the kids too!

140
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,078
Is Juan Uno there?
Did you get the dollars?

141
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,078
Did you see El Negro's mother?

142
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:00,072
I told you, I didn't want you
to rent the flat, Mama!

143
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,669
<i>When they pay,</i>
<i>I'll send you the money.</i>

144
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,348
I can't bear living here!
I want to leave!

145
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,639
I can't bear it anymore, Mama!

146
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,354
Did you go to El Negro's mother?
Hide them well. Don't get robbed!

147
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,549
Then buy a plane ticket and come.

148
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,274
They checked on it?
Can I come back?

149
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,994
<i>Fernando saw the lawyer.</i>

150
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,589
You must wait 2 months more.

151
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,917
How's Papa?
Did he get the ECG done?

152
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,989
Tell him to stop smoking.
I want to see him alive.

153
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,993
Hello? Goddamn exile!

154
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,314
We were cut off!
At least we got to talk.

155
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,198
You! You talked!

156
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,478
I'll get more change.

157
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,079
What a phone!

158
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,229
Let us talk!

159
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,637
What a glutton!

160
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,155
Wonderful!

161
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,477
ANGEL'S TANGO-DY

162
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,715
They're coming!

163
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,398
It's starting any minute!

164
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,797
What a beautiful set!

165
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,475
Here they are.

166
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,513
What are they dancing? Tango?

167
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,113
Marvellous!

168
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,673
I thought you might not come.

169
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,749
Miss your Argentines?

170
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,075
Are you crazy?

171
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,116
This is Juan Dos.

172
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,748
Not Gardel?

173
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,191
Is that Florence Millet,
the actress?

174
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,560
- Is the Tango-dy on then?
- Sure, dummy!

175
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,279
Here's Mariana.

176
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,272
Argentina's greatest actress.

177
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,118
And the most beautiful!

178
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,628
She did "The Respectful Prostitute".

179
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,071
Yes, she fits the part!

180
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,555
Coming...

181
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,795
Are you the writer?

182
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,639
Only of the music.
The author is Juan Uno.

183
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,111
I see - Juan Uno and Juan Dos.

184
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,277
That's how they call us.

185
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,311
But we're practically one.

186
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,039
Juan Uno lives in Buenos Aires.

187
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,719
He'll never leave.

188
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,754
Loaded with talent, but raving mad!

189
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,156
I love Argentine authors:

190
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,351
Borges, Cortázar...

191
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,790
And that famous one... with Solitude.

192
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,473
García Márquez?

193
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,635
Wonderful!

194
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,193
He's Colombian!

195
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,839
Doesn't matter.
What's worse:

196
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,473
They're not translated enough.

197
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,235
Ready?

198
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,839
Off we go into exile...

199
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,950
You're going to see a Tango-dy.

200
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,471
Tango-dy: Tango plus tragedy

201
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,511
plus comedy.

202
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,915
That Mariana's splendid!

203
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,154
Is the musician her husband?

204
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,593
Very interesting...

205
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,751
You're kidding? It's more than that.

206
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,475
It's loaded with talent,
but... hard to understand.

207
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,351
Like everything you love, darling.

208
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,869
I'd have to see a finished version.

209
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,959
But it's great. I love this Tango-dy.

210
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,516
Can you help us out?

211
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,994
Of course!

212
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,432
When it's ready, call me

213
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,312
and we'll show it to Jean-Marie.

214
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,752
But it must be complete!

215
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,118
- We didn't agree to that!
- What do you mean?

216
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,949
- It needs 2 more months of rehearsal!
- Don't get excited?

217
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,550
You said you had a theater,
backing and...

218
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,274
...that Florence would sign
her contract today.

219
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,799
That's almost true.

220
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,953
Almost? You're crazy!
You got nothing that's real!

221
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,755
The Angel is finished, finished!

222
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,518
Angel, don't go!

223
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,592
- The Angel's taking off...
- You'll break your wings!

224
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,911
For me, Tango-dy is over.

225
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,556
We've rehearsed for three months
and I dream of finishing it.

226
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,716
I can't help you anymore.

227
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,758
Do you think I'm not hurt?

228
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,676
I've been in Paris for nine years!

229
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,957
It's another flop.
I'm a professional!

230
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,272
Nine years!
I've taken all the courses...

231
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,950
With Béjart and Peter Brook...
Do you think I'm not hurt?

232
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,911
You're leaving us just like that?

233
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,997
What are we going to do?

234
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,193
Can you replace him?

235
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,594
Me?

236
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,309
Sure!

237
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,238
We'll all help you!

238
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,595
There's not much more to do...

239
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,115
THE POETICS OF JUAN UNO

240
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,272
How did you think of the Tango-dy?

241
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,910
Back home, I was really
in a shitty mess.

242
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,670
Separated from my wife, no job,

243
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,110
and banned on the radio.

244
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,436
Juan Uno said: "If you played sax,

245
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,596
you could stay here,

246
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,955
but with the bandoneon:

247
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,195
Go to Paris!"

248
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,470
"And what'll I do in Paris?"

249
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,675
I asked him.

250
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,159
"The Tango-dy, Juan!"

251
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,438
"The Exile of Gardel".

252
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,991
"What's that,

253
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,713
what's the Tango-dy?"

254
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,076
"It tells of what's happening

255
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,430
here in Buenos Aires".

256
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,837
I said: "It's a terrible risk!

257
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,917
They'll tear you apart!"

258
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,758
What did he say to that?

259
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,757
He said: "Deciding to be

260
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,791
is always a risk."

261
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,238
Juan, we are both in danger,

262
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,391
Living here is a risk,

263
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,717
but leaving is also a risk.

264
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,391
Success lies in resisting,

265
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,434
and in staying united...
here and over there."

266
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,630
That's how he began to develop

267
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,990
his strategy of risk:

268
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,960
"We must invent a culture,

269
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,720
a risk of poetics."

270
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,396
The full power of desire!

271
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,111
Gardel... the Angel...

272
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,236
Some are gone, others have disappeared.

273
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,356
We are buried in Corrientes
and Talcahuano.

274
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,834
That's Juan Uno?

275
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,991
No, that's Discépolo.

276
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,111
Here's Troilo, my master.

277
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,635
Here's Arlt.

278
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,953
Macedonio Fernández...

279
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,119
Marechal... Homero Manzi...

280
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,474
An anthology of Buenos Aires...
a mythology...

281
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,273
A cosmogony.

282
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,993
A poem of love...

283
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,399
But with blood.

284
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,313
Listen: Juan Uno's exile...

285
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,869
<i>Alone like a zero</i>

286
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,958
<i>Far away like a stray dog</i>

287
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,875
Do you like mate?

288
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,117
<i>Pulling my old bones together</i>

289
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:32,308
<i>Alone, as for a suicide</i>

290
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,556
Nothing's too bitter for you.

291
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,678
French wine?

292
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,076
That's the truth.

293
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,395
The poetics of Juan Uno, his exile.

294
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,354
That's our Tango-dy.

295
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,789
That's the show?

296
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,797
That's it...

297
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,553
Uno writes with no logic...

298
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,993
In bars and restaurants.

299
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,310
Oppose intellectual speculation
with life's fantasy.

300
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,148
Down with imitation,

301
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,828
creativity's bureaucracy
and dependency.

302
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,234
Dare to decide.

303
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,551
Decision is already success.

304
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,918
Drawings too...

305
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,599
We must find the overall logic.

306
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,757
Beware of comfort and vanity.

307
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:27,839
Throw esthetic rules out of the window.
Mix styles.

308
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,791
Smash ready-made formulas
and invent our own.

309
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,473
Creation means whim and disorder:

310
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,955
It must be organised!

311
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,392
We must risk ugliness to attain beauty.

312
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,151
That's a Tango-dy's principle.

313
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,357
Achieving perfection is death.
Long live imperfection and life.

314
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,713
It's Uno's hermeneutics.
Understand, Pierre?

315
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:16,473
<i>We'll begin Act 2

316
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:23,270
<i>With letters from exile</i>
<i>and the homeland</i>

317
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:30,679
<i>We'll tell you</i>

318
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:37,071
<i>What they lived through in Paris</i>

319
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:44,235
<i>Letters from those in exile</i>
<i>come and go</i>

320
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:51,069
<i>Loaded with love</i>

321
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,391
<i>With news and demands</i>

322
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,758
<i>They prove everyone is back there</i>

323
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,957
<i>Letters come and go</i>

324
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,357
<i>Letters, more letters</i>

325
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,279
<i>Letters come and go</i>

326
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,632
LETTERS FROM EXILE

327
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,833
<i>After what happened to Papa,</i>
<i>we were to go to Europe</i>

328
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,429
<i>and to come back after vacation.</i>

329
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,598
<i>But Grandma wrote, telling Mama</i>
<i>to wait a few months.</i>

330
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,470
<i>It's been that way for several years.</i>

331
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,671
<i>I lost a year at school,</i>
<i>my pals</i>

332
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,273
<i>and Diego, the boy I dated.</i>

333
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,839
<i>Mama tries to help,</i>
<i>but when I tell her what's happened,</i>

334
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,996
<i>she doesn't know</i>
<i>what to say.</i>

335
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,710
<i>When I lost Papa,</i>

336
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,200
<i>I felt like I'd lost Mama too.</i>

337
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:32,591
<i>Every Saturday we go</i>
<i>to a solidarity meeting</i>

338
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,309
<i>in a theatre near Paris.</i>

339
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,632
<i>What a bore!</i>
<i>But for me it is</i>

340
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,512
<i>as if I had a date with Papa.</i>

341
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,908
People are fed up with messages.

342
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,434
People want to hear

343
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,868
something positive:

344
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,955
We have to win their attention.

345
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,555
How many of us are here?

346
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,519
Thank you for coming,

347
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,233
Jean-Marie and Florence.

348
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,235
We must make an united effort!

349
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,556
To speak to people in a new language!

350
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,556
Will it work with mannequins?

351
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,352
It'll work better with them
if there's music

352
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,152
and a show, right?

353
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,517
Yes, something positive!

354
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,756
We're constantly torn between feelings

355
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,636
of weariness and duty and pity,
but we feel

356
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,396
that things aren't coherent.

357
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,679
What we need to know first of all is

358
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,229
why the public isn't concerned anymore,

359
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,590
why they're out of touch,

360
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,313
why they've lost that curiosity

361
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,078
and that passion...

362
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,192
Why have we become amorphic?

363
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,870
Why don't we ask any questions anymore?

364
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,389
Why have we taken refuge

365
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,909
in an egocentricity

366
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,831
that's leading us to death...

367
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,716
<i>When I heard that France</i>
<i>has over 400 committees</i>

368
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,514
<i>of support for the Argentines,</i>
<i>I was deeply moved.</i>

369
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,633
<i>One group is called</i>
<i>"Marta and Martita".</i>

370
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,513
<i>I remember the day</i>

371
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,156
<i>when Arlette and Céline arrived</i>
<i>from the Alps in their 2CV,</i>

372
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,597
<i>to organise Alcira's trip</i>
<i>to Buenos Aires.</i>

373
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,319
"Dearest Martita,

374
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,472
Soon you'll be 3 years old,

375
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,398
far from your loved ones.

376
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,596
It's been already three years,

377
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,433
since you and your parents

378
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,153
were snatched away.

379
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,669
You, a baby full of life.

380
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,836
For three years, we've done nothing
but think of you,

381
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,278
and try to find you.

382
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:51,358
For three years, I've done nothing
but dream of you.

383
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,072
Where can you be?

384
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,312
What are your eyes like?

385
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,078
Like those of Marta?

386
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,998
Or those of RaúI?

387
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,678
What do the people

388
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,518
you are with call you?

389
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,113
Are you happy? Do you need anything?

390
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,437
Do you know your Grandma

391
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,517
would smash down all doors to find you?

392
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,279
That we're going to Buenos Aires

393
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,799
to find you?

394
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,079
Don't be afraid:

395
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,759
I'll recognise you.

396
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,037
You're my daughter's daughter,

397
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,071
the blood of my own blood.

398
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,636
Trust me: I'll find you!

399
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,835
See you soon, grand-daughter!"

400
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,074
What can we do?

401
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,995
A campaign of support

402
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,155
for our trip:

403
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,753
We'll send 10,000 letters

404
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,439
to the Argentine government

405
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,909
demanding that Martita

406
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,189
be returned.

407
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,313
But the trip...

408
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,149
Is it already arranged?

409
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,600
We've collected enough money

410
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,360
to go with Alcira.

411
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,756
I don't know what to say!

412
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,474
I can't keep my wife

413
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,954
from going...

414
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,193
But to land like that in Buenos Aires:

415
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,913
Totally crazy!

416
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,477
It's not our first trip

417
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,591
to defend human rights.

418
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,276
We've always obtained a result.

419
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,078
We have the support

420
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,872
of many world organisations.

421
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,832
UNO IN BUENOS AIRES

422
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,595
Ok, hold on!

423
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,395
Good, good, good...

424
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,475
Come here, Inés!

425
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,514
This is very important.

426
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,513
Your hands like this...

427
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,714
This is the transition.

428
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,033
Let's try it again! Come on!

429
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,275
We don't have 7, 8 and 9 and the finale.

430
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,549
Not number 8!

431
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,157
It's beyond me!

432
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,271
I can't imagine how!

433
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,149
Don't worry. Listen:

434
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,793
Juan Uno changes the Tango-dy daily

435
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:19,678
because he's discovering
the fullness of exile.

436
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,518
His exile. Understand?

437
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,271
There are terrible things:

438
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,435
Massacres...

439
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,035
I can't do a show

440
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,515
without a finale!

441
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,551
Ok, I'll call him...

442
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,234
Either you connect me with Buenos Aires
or I'll kill you!

443
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,552
I have no dial tone! I must talk
with Juan Uno in Buenos Aires!

444
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,670
This is Juan.

445
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,472
We need grounding!
Pass me the wires!

446
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,319
You're so dumb, Miseria!

447
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,074
It's an "antimatic" phone booth.

448
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,953
"Antimatics" require a ground line.

449
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,589
It's the sole secret.
50 francs each.

450
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,349
- 50 francs...
- 50 francs to talk to Juan Uno.

451
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,475
50 francs, that's cheap!

452
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,908
I'm doing it only for you.

453
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,834
We mustn't be seen!

454
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,391
Come here. I'll give you some juice!

455
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,316
Stand there.
As soon as you got some juice...

456
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,875
connect the wires.

457
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,950
I got the dial tone!

458
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,229
Hand me the pliers.
Ok, see you later...

459
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,354
What's going on here?

460
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,718
You know, the ending... Juan Uno...

461
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,797
You're under arrest.

462
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,749
Ana!

463
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,354
It's been three years!

464
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:12,636
You're divine!
You haven't changed at all!

465
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,195
Neither have you!

466
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,237
- How's my Buenos Aires?
- Worse than ever!

467
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,871
Everything's too expensive to buy!
A disaster!

468
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,436
- What're you doing? Any theatre?
- On TV, as always.

469
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,790
- Look at that, darling!
- What a country!

470
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,596
And you want to leave?
Look where you are!

471
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,109
Close your eyes and look!

472
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,637
How odd people are here!

473
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,717
Mariana, you don't meet
with the refugees, I hope?

474
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,718
I'm serious?
You'd be done for.

475
00:46:54,920 --> 00:47:00,199
Upon your return,
you'd be finished. Be careful!

476
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,955
Picasso!

477
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,479
No, Picabia.

478
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,677
What a resemblance!

479
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:21,353
Such a flat! It's divine!

480
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,318
What is it?

481
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,678
They're fucking.

482
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,799
Fucking? Incredible!

483
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,395
Get dressed!

484
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,039
I'm with Cool, Mama!

485
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,949
Exactly!

486
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,680
Don't push!
Where'll I do it?

487
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,598
I don't know... in school...

488
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,955
- In my own home!
- They fuck here?

489
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,033
Marvellous! That's Europe for you!

490
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,515
Where else should they fuck?
In the street?

491
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,713
I'm sick of living here!

492
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,673
So go home.
Nothing happens there anymore.

493
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,752
Nothing?
What about Adela's boy?

494
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,830
Who knows what he'd been up to.

495
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:33,676
People here exaggerate so.
There's no torture like before.

496
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,877
It's awful, but you get used to it.

497
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,753
- I doubt it.
- You want to go back or not?

498
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,154
- Sure!
- Then go!

499
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,510
- What do you mean by "go"?
- Susana went back.

500
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,989
She's delighted.

501
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,317
Sure! She talked to a general.

502
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,199
You should see Ricardito.

503
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,113
Explain to him.

504
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:10,316
Why should I explain myself to him?
They're the ones with explaining to do!

505
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,115
You exaggerate so!
You dramatise everything.

506
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,629
I have to run.

507
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,114
I'll call you...

508
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,068
- For your phone bill.
- I don't want it.

509
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,749
I know, but I pay it anyway.
So I can phone you tomorrow.

510
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,595
Juan...

511
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,599
I'm leaving.

512
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,072
I'm quitting the Tango-dy,
the "Exile"...

513
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:14,989
What?

514
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:20,960
- I'm going back to Buenos Aires.
- You can't.

515
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,428
I miss my family, home,

516
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,154
friends, the theatre,
everything...

517
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:34,595
Yes, darling, but you're here with me.
We'll do "The Exile" together.

518
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,719
- We'll find an ending.
- Never!

519
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:43,037
I swear we'll put the show on!

520
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:48,351
Don't tell me no tales!
Go sing that one to Gardel!

521
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,991
And you'll marry me, Mariana.

522
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,832
The day I'll love you!

523
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,398
The day you'll love me,

524
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,316
we'll go back together.

525
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:16,276
<i>Don't tell me no tales</i>
<i>Go sing it to Gardel</i>

526
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,199
<i>- I say I'll take you away</i>
<i>- I love you and it scares me</i>

527
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,279
<i>- I can't go on anymore</i>
<i>- I love you and I'm not playing</i>

528
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,990
<i>- I'll take you away</i>
<i>- I believe you and it scares me</i>

529
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:33,353
<i>- I love you</i>
<i>- I believe you and I'm scared</i>

530
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:39,638
<i>Exile adds to your natural madness</i>

531
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:47,829
<i>Like a drizzling rain</i>
<i>that goes on, never ending</i>

532
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:55,636
<i>Exile goes on</i>
<i>like a carnival of sadness</i>

533
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:05,435
DAILY-DRAMA TANGOS

534
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,397
<i>Winter vacation arrived...</i>

535
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,555
<i>With Christmas trees... visits...</i>

536
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,274
<i>Grotesque as it was, I'll never forget</i>
<i>Christmas 1979.</i>

537
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,593
<i>As if the dying year meant to end</i>
<i>Mama's dream of returning...</i>

538
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,075
<i>Or Juan and El Negro's pizzeria.</i>

539
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:38,911
<i>It all began the night of the arrival of</i>
<i>Pepa, the mother of Juan Dos.</i>

540
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,349
<i>She came loaded with letters and gifts</i>

541
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,636
<i>and the savings of El Negro and Juan.</i>

542
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,590
<i>Afraid of being searched or losing them,</i>

543
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,394
<i>she'd put the 6,000 dollars</i>
<i>in a handkerchief,</i>

544
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,594
<i>which she hid in her bloomers.</i>

545
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,558
<i>They got away from her.</i>

546
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,030
My God!

547
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,114
The money...

548
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,836
Gone
with the handkerchief!

549
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,158
She flushed the toilet, Juan!

550
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,990
The dollars are up shit creek!

551
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,513
Look how the French dance!

552
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,149
Thank you!

553
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,669
Now I'd like to introduce the quintet

554
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,235
of Juan Dos.

555
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,876
They're going to premiere for you

556
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,436
some numbers from "The Exile of Gardel".

557
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:52,636
In homage to Gardel and Discépolo,

558
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,990
two great tango composers

559
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,350
whose work was banned
by the dictatorship.

560
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,759
No need to introduce you:
Eduardo, my husband, Hector Lobotrico,

561
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,076
Norma Lobotrico
from the embassy.

562
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,669
Ernesto Figueroa
and his wife.

563
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,553
He works at the Ministry of Economy.

564
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,113
It's best we left.

565
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,035
We've no reason to be here, Ana.

566
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,476
Is something wrong?

567
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:29,990
Wrong?
Are you joking?

568
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,953
I don't understand...

569
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,113
The Exile of Gardel?
As if he'd been exiled!

570
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,031
It's just the title of the play...

571
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,310
Like slandering our nation!

572
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,750
What did you say?

573
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,394
You heard me.
I'm notjoking.

574
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,239
It's your fault
the country is in such a state!

575
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,436
It's your fault!

576
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,068
Shut up!

577
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,157
- Never!
- Subversive!

578
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,998
- Fascist!
- Terrorist!

579
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,352
Throw him out!

580
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,029
I love you...

581
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,952
...and you know it.

582
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,756
TWO EXILES

583
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:16,069
Pierre! The show needs to end,

584
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,793
but not the play!

585
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,275
Cause exile continues here and at home!

586
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,239
That feeling'll go on with the public.

587
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,118
We must give them an ending...

588
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,552
I'm a director!

589
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,638
You don't understand.
It must be left open...

590
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:37,353
It's the South, like our lives,
our encounters...

591
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,672
It's the pampas, see?

592
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,438
Enormous... infinite... unending...

593
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,115
Brilliant! A pampas show!

594
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,673
I never heard such nonsense!

595
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,154
I want an ending!

596
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,516
No adventures for me!

597
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,438
That's not true!

598
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,756
You won't take any risks!

599
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,509
It's not disorder but a different order.

600
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:02,030
Not a lack of style,
but a different style and form.

601
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,793
No creation without risks. Bureaucrat!

602
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,629
And the creativity and talent
you mentioned? Joker!

603
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,995
You're scared, that's all.

604
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:19,192
Scared to break the shell
you're wrapped in!

605
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,319
Me? Afraid?

606
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,029
Scared! Scared to death!

607
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,470
I've been here ten years...

608
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,671
When did you get here?

609
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,440
I quit and walked out on everything.

610
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,478
I'm the exile, not you!

611
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,233
Think you must take a ship

612
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,998
to be in exile?

613
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,072
I left everything, my work, the theatre,

614
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:47,352
so that I could be free!

615
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,229
That's my exile...

616
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:00,271
Any story has an end.

617
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:26,039
<i>Tango, tango</i>
<i>to dance together</i>

618
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,550
<i>Two more...</i>
<i>complicity tango</i>

621
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:57,595
<i>A land</i>

<i>And above all respects you</i>

<i>Even at the age of lollipops</i>

624

<i>A land</i>

<i>even if you're only a little mouse</i>

627
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,511
<i>A land</i>

628
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,719
<i>Where I can be myself</i>

629

<i>Without letting myself be stepped on</i>

630
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,068
<i>Or having to drop my pants</i>

631
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:46,434
<i>Where will this country be</i>

632
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:53,751
<i>Where you can work</i>
<i>without having to beg?</i>

633

ABSENCES

636
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,674
The land we left exists no more.

637
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,315
It's changed,

638
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,999
theatre... the people... everything.

639
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:33,669
We must accept that
in order to go on living.

640
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,711
That's what counts.

641
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,432
I know.

642
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,471
But I can't forget...

643
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,150
I miss him...

644
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,788
I see him...

645
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,032
I see Hernán.

646
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,799
I see the house...

647
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,750
Angela... the plants...

648
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,830
I can't accept the thought

649
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,830
of having lost it all.

650
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:30,754
We have all lost

651
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,509
something very dear and valuable.

652
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,112
But we must admit that.
It's the only way to go on living.

653
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,392
It's all that counts.

654
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:55,392
I don't feel like it. Understand?

655
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,194
I don't feel like it anymore.

656
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:03,196
You think I feel like writing?

657
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,199
What a chore it is to get up each day.

658
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,557
At times I'd like to die... but no...

659
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:18,150
Cortázar was right:
We must find ourselves a goal...

660
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:21,750
A project... we must invent
things to do...

661
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,717
What is it to be old, Gerardo?

662
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:30,595
To have no more desires.

663
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,436
Simply to have no more desires.

664
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:41,871
When I think of old San Martín.
25 years here.

665
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:46,869
25 years alone.

666
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,552
Such ingratitude!

667
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,797
The man who
liberated half a continent.

668
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,039
<i>The house of General San Martín</i>
<i>Boulogne-sur-Mer</i>

669
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,188
"You will acknowledge

670
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,868
as the nation's sole
legitimate government

671
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:21,636
only that which has been elected by the
spontaneous free will of the people."

672
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,318
He died in this room.

673
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,076
Exile is absence.

674
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:51,592
And what is death,
if not a prolonged absence?

675
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,075
Who among us hasn't died a bit
these past years?

676
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,834
Who hasn't lost his dreams...

677
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,518
...and his hopes?

678
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:29,310
I know I'll never see
the land of my dreams.

679
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,798
The same as San Martín and Vallejo.

680
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,957
"There are so many
hard times in life..."

681
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,438
Why didn't Papa go into exile?

682
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,917
He thought nothing could happen to him.

683
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,792
But he's been threatened!

684
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,918
Like everyone else.

685
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:17,630
When Hernán took on Martita's case,
there were six more.

686
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,910
No lawyers would take them.

687
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:30,678
Twenty lawyers had already
been killed or imprisoned.

688
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:35,437
They were killed or they had to flee.

689
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:38,909
But why?

690
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:43,635
Why?

691
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,435
We've decided to do a performance

692
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,949
of the Tango-dy here.

693
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,635
Tango-dy?

694
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,315
Yes, in 10 days. Is it possible?

695
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,389
Pierre agrees,

696
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,233
if the group regroups

697
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,277
and you get an ending.

698
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,469
The ending?

699
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,832
Every story has an end...

700
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,109
What'd Florence say?

701
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:24,351
People from the Cultural Centers are
coming, critics, producers. They'II...

702
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:27,958
Please! There are kids
all over the place!

703
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,918
It's not my fault. Come...

704
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:32,151
We've got to finish it...

705
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,511
- We'll do it together.
- We need an ending!

706
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,553
So let's do it!

707
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:41,069
No, the Tango-dy! Idiot!

708
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:46,157
- Pierre wants...
- All he wants is to see me dead.

709
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,396
What are you doing?
Please, no!

710
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,119
Get out!

711
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,792
Seen Frédéric?

712
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:58,436
No, close the door.

713
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,113
I'm going in the bath.

714
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:24,276
I love you, I love you!

715
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,838
What's the kid doing here?

716
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,719
Hello, madam!

717
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,990
Who's better?
King Juan Carlos or Giscard?

718
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,315
Stop it, Manuela!

719
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:59,556
The last one: Which is easier?
French or Spanish?

720
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,554
Spanish.

721
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,599
How lucky!

722
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,912
We're going to Barcelona.

723
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,389
On foot?

724
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,073
In a week.

725
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:20,235
We're going to Barcelona.

726
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,391
Are you crazy? No one told me!

727
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,677
I don't know. Ask Mama.

728
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,519
Why didn't you tell me?

729
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,198
I couldn't, Juan.

730
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,992
Couldn't you have asked for my opinion?

731
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:47,074
Ask you if I can leave Paris?

732
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:53,435
We separated seven years ago.

733
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:54,993
I know, Alicia.

734
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:01,590
It's my firstjob offer
since I came to Europe.

735
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:02,994
It's not in France.

736
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,031
I know it's not.

737
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:09,115
But France won't give me a work permit.

738
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,636
So why stay in Paris?

739
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:14,549
The kids shouldn't be hauled
from town to town anymore.

740
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,194
Buenos Aires, Paris, and now where?

741
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,515
You're the one who sent for us.

742
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:25,994
You'd been thrown out of the school,
right? You felt persecuted.

743
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,599
You're right...

744
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,594
But you said that I'd have a job.

745
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,279
No, that I'd help you.

746
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,718
Please don't go, I beg you.

747
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:46,115
I'm not being selfish.
I want us to stay together.

748
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:50,836
I cannot bear the thought of being
separated from the kids again.

749
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:57,193
I must seize this opportunity.

750
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,311
A kiss, my love.

751
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,398
CRAZY MILONGA

752
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,396
Seen the group Juan Uno sent?

753
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,995
You can't imagine what
life's like back there.

754
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,952
Someone disappears daily.

755
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,834
But our first strike was a success.

756
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,834
The beat us up,
but the struggle goes on.

757
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,313
Nothing from Uno?

758
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,275
A little something.

759
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,713
What is it?
A bass drum?

760
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:42,389
He's crazy!

761
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:43,715
No letter?

762
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,999
"United we shall win."

763
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,633
What about the ending?

764
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,988
But who is it? Who is Juan Uno?

765
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,553
The guy'll kill me.

766
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,509
Snapped.

767
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,432
Totally snapped. Nothing to do.

768
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,039
I don't want to!

769
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:46,114
THE SINGER'S GHOST

770
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,878
Juan... someone's coming.

771
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:05,959
A man!

772
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,237
He's watching us. Let's go!

773
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,439
He looks like a cop.

774
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:25,438
He's laughing, Juan,
he's laughing at us!

775
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:29,588
He's coming over!

776
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,592
You're not doing it right...

777
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:44,388
Wait...

778
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,075
There!

779
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:03,670
What a guy! Brilliant!

780
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,399
What a character!

781
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,637
If I talk about this,
no one'll believe me!

782
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,673
The Café "Universal"?

783
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,473
Is Juan Uno there?

784
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,714
Is this "Los Angelitos"?

785
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,194
Is Juan Uno there?

786
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,557
Juan Dos from Paris.

787
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,037
You old beanpole!

788
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:37,597
Mariana's with me. I'll put her on!

789
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:57,154
Send me the ending!

790
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,955
I'm serious. We're staging "Gardel".

791
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,353
He's crazy. He hung up!

792
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,110
Impossible. Call him back!

793
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:26,229
May I?

794
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:29,678
Don't insist.

795
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:33,278
He's scared. That's normal.

796
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:38,235
Aren't you Discépolo,
our deceased poet?

797
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:40,717
Discépolo... himself.

798
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,469
Come on.

799
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:47,632
Uno wants the play on stage. It's his
greatest dream, but...

800
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:53,239
It's easy here to talk about it.
But he's back there.

801
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:56,000
That's a bad thing... terrible!

802
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:01,431
If his name's on the Tango-dy,
he'll be in trouble.

803
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,275
It's best he stay there.

804
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,755
We never meant to mention his name.

805
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:09,394
You must understand. Fear is terrifying:

806
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:13,272
It follows us everywhere
like our own shadow.

807
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:16,278
Like a mad dog before it bites!

808
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:20,236
What would become of us
if Uno disappeared?

809
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:23,637
But he can't abandon us
before the ending.

810
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:25,512
We'll find one.

811
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:29,277
The Tango-dy will be our revenge!

812
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:55,315
<i>Bandied about by life,</i>
<i>a wandering bohemian</i>

813
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,997
<i>I am Buenos Aires,</i>
<i>anchored in Paris</i>

814
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:02,277
<i>O distant Buenos Aires,</i>
<i>keep your splendor</i>

815
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,513
<i>It's already been 10 years</i>
<i>since you saw me go away</i>

816
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,515
<i>If you only knew my desire</i>
<i>to see you again!</i>

817
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:12,792
<i>Here a penniless prisoner</i>
<i>without hope</i>

818
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,549
<i>Perhaps one night</i>
<i>Death will take me by surprise</i>

819
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:20,914
<i>And, farewell, Buenos Aires,</i>
<i>I'll never see you anymore.</i>

820
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:10,030
THE FINAL TANGO-DY

821
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:30,992
It was great!

822
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,839
Especially the music!

823
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,393
Well done, Pierre!

824
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,829
And the tangos!

825
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,033
"The Exile of Gardel" is beautiful!

826
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:40,798
I always knew it was!

827
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:45,359
And Gardel was such a great character!

828
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:50,270
It's a pity. Why don't we get
to see Gardel, Pierre?

829
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,716
But he's present all the time.

830
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:58,031
A pity! A great idea!

831
01:27:58,240 --> 01:27:59,958
An entire era.

832
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:01,878
A great man.

833
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,956
I met him one day at the studio.

834
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:07,276
I was a young film extra.

835
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:09,198
He'd arrive each morning,

836
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,152
with a hideous broad,

837
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:12,998
a filthy rich American,

838
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,872
the widow of Chesterfield.

839
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,072
So he'd arrive in a huge car

840
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,952
and said to us:

841
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,988
Muchachos - with his Toulouse accent -

842
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,711
Get rid of this big cow for me,

843
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:26,831
and I'll take you to dinner."

844
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:28,559
Know where he took us?

845
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:30,273
Us, the cinema hobos?

846
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,913
To the Plaza!

847
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:34,515
Fabulous Gardel! What a pity...

848
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:35,869
Interested?

849
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,991
Yes, it's very good.

850
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,840
It's wonderful, a very beautiful show!

851
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,676
I don't see

852
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:51,030
how it could interest our audiences.

853
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:53,639
It's a bit local.

854
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,797
Yes, the music, the characters,

855
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,877
even the tangos...

856
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,911
...it's too Argentine for us!

857
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:01,959
Would people understand?

858
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:03,718
Are you serious?

859
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:04,875
Yes, why?

860
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:09,471
What did you expect? An Eskimo tango?

861
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:12,511
Don't be upset!

862
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:20,115
What?

863
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,076
The Tango-dy is really southern,

864
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,396
from Río de la Plata.

865
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,554
That doesn't mean much to us...

866
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,268
We're not used

867
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:35,754
to this theatrical form.

868
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:38,520
That's no reason to reject it.

869
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:41,720
Pierre, explain what it is.

870
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,399
It's a Tango-dy.

871
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,315
A work the author conceived

872
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,875
without consulting you.

873
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:52,312
Why'd you invite us?

874
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,635
If we judge this by what we usually

875
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:58,115
see here, we won't understand it.

876
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:00,590
I liked it, but the ending...

877
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:03,193
I didn't quite grasp it.

878
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:05,153
The ending... is a risk

879
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:06,793
that we must take.

880
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,028
In France we tend to want

881
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:12,708
people to do what we expect of them.

882
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:14,793
You believe in it, Nathalie?

883
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,509
I'm interested.

884
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:20,351
I'd like to have the show

885
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,596
for our festival in Amiens.

886
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:40,119
They don't know what we feel.

887
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,033
Don't exaggerate.

888
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:43,719
The public's the public!

889
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,709
Aren't we running a risk

890
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,111
of finding no finale at all,

891
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:55,993
if there's no return home?

892
01:30:58,360 --> 01:30:59,839
We must fight back!

893
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:07,675
The Tango-dy has found its conclusion...

894
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:14,838
...and we, the 2 Juans,
have become of no use.

895
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:18,350
Don't be depressed, my love.

896
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:22,829
Juan... don't fall apart...

897
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:46,796
<i>Let's continue the exile and song</i>

898
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:52,595
<i>Looking for an outcome, a finale</i>

899
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:59,797
<i>Tales transformed into fiction</i>

900
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:06,030
<i>In all their painful humanness</i>

901
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:13,194
<i>Europe has offered solidarity</i>

902
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:19,556
<i>In all sincerity or out of guilt</i>

903
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:25,832
<i>The North has provided its complicity</i>

904
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:32,712
<i>Loneliness from East to West</i>

905
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:35,790
<i>Nothing new to announce.</i>

906
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:39,792
<i>It was incredible</i>
<i>to see the courts again,</i>

907
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,230
<i>the police stations, the barracks.</i>

908
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:45,190
<i>And think every moment</i>

909
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:50,471
<i>that Marta and Martita</i>
<i>might have been hauled through them.</i>

910
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:02,593
<i>We were afraid we'd find ourselves</i>
<i>alone in Buenos Aires.</i>

911
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:08,038
<i>But the mothers and grandmothers</i>
<i>awaited us.</i>

912
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:12,916
<i>I realised so many people have been</i>
<i>fighting for the same cause.</i>

913
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:15,750
<i>And that gave me new hope.</i>

914
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:39,472
Ladies and gents!

915
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:40,829
El Negro and Susana

916
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,189
have something to show you!

917
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:44,590
An act for the life

918
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,950
we've dreamed of, we've invented!

919
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:51,159
Unique! Little Victoria!

920
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:34,679
ALONE

921
01:35:58,440 --> 01:35:59,429
Hello, Mama?

922
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:07,355
Papa? What'd you say?
How are you? Better?

923
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,555
Who?

924
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:21,109
Who, Papa?

925
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:24,395
Mama?

926
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:05,317
Wait for me! Don't go!

927
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:09,511
Mama, I'd want...

928
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:14,559
Wait! I want to say things
I never told you before!

929
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:19,276
Don't go, Mama...

930
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:33,469
I love you, Mama!

931
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:12,389
<i>Alone and on the fringe like a zero</i>

932
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:17,398
<i>Like those thrust aside</i>
<i>I struggle on, alone</i>

933
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:23,871
<i>Lost in the distance, like a stray dog</i>
<i>I fight against oblivion</i>

934
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:28,070
<i>Pulling my old bones together</i>

935
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:32,390
<i>Alone and penniless, as for a suicide</i>

936
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:36,309
<i>All I have left is the tango</i>
<i>to tell of my exile</i>

937
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:51,474
<i>Alone and haunted in my Buenos Aires</i>

938
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:56,239
<i>I wander aimlessly</i>
<i>like a shot in the air</i>

939
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:10,513
<i>Alone and hidden</i>
<i>with the saga of my people</i>

940
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:15,592
<i>That they have banned, living on,</i>
<i>engraved in my memory</i>

941
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:43,835
<i>I hang up my heart in the closet</i>

942
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:48,876
<i>My poor heart</i>
<i>shot full of holes</i>

943
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,797
The clock... so beautiful!

944
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:21,552
Hands off, María.

945
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:25,593
Papa's pictures!

946
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:27,995
Please don't touch them!

947
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:30,111
Let me see. Don't be selfish.

948
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,152
Look! Papa, when he was young!

949
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:37,875
Please, María, close that!

950
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:45,751
Don't you understand that's all mine?

951
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:49,074
You're such a pain!

952
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:52,110
How long are you going to keep this up?

953
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:55,396
I don't like you
pawning through my things!

954
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,592
I know... but what are you going to do
with your life?

955
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,630
Leave!

956
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:05,515
Then go! Once and for all!

957
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:07,995
Because I want to live my life too!

958
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:11,476
I'm going and you're going with me.

959
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:15,912
No, you go! I'm renting
a studio with Teresa.

960
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:20,479
What'd you say?

961
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:23,592
You heard me. I want to live alone.

962
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:27,078
I want to have something of my own!

963
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:29,155
Shut up!

964
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,439
Don't talk to me that way!

965
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:34,239
I talk to you however I can.

966
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,319
If your papa had lived...

967
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:39,034
He'd have opposed your whims!

968
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:41,231
And I'd never have lived
through years of shit!

969
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:42,668
Shut up!

970
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:49,952
You're so selfish you're unable
to enter my room.

971
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:52,996
Because you know I'd be crying!

972
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:06,509
My darling...

973
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:14,516
Forgive me, sweetheart,
you're all I have,

974
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:16,278
the only one I love.

975
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:21,390
But your father is always here,

976
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:26,110
he's present and waiting for me.

977
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,595
I wish he'd disappear
once and for all, understand?

978
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,119
Yes, Mama.

979
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:42,274
But how long'll I understand you?

980
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:45,316
You never spoke to me like this.

981
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:49,873
You never told me
how you felt about Papa.

982
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,637
I can't forget him either.

983
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:22,872
<i>After all you've been through, you're</i>
<i>still causing trouble?</i>

984
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,956
- Who are you?
<i>- A friend.</i>

985
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:31,159
<i>Keep it up and you'll never see your</i>
<i>daughter or grand-daughter again.</i>

986
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:32,873
Don't dare give me your name?

987
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:35,071
<i>- Understand?</i>
- Hoodlum!

988
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:38,352
<i>You'll never see your daughter</i>
<i>and grand-daughter again.</i>

989
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:15,433
<i>For you who remained</i>

990
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:22,872
<i>For Gaby, Tito and Diego</i>

991
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:30,189
<i>For you who went into exile</i>
<i>in your neighbourhood</i>

992
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:35,349
<i>or in your hovel</i>

993
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:42,199
<i>For you who underwent</i>

994
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:47,795
<i>the general's interrogations</i>

995
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:53,870
<i>For you who endured</i>

996
01:45:54,840 --> 01:46:01,234
<i>the cops and manhunts</i>

997
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:06,156
<i>For you that they dragged</i>

998
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:12,788
<i>by the hair, poor suspect</i>

999
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:18,435
<i>For you that they humiliated</i>

1000
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:23,950
<i>and abandoned naked</i>

1001
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:30,429
<i>My song flies out to you</i>

1002
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:36,710
<i>In search for its roots</i>

1003
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:41,956
<i>We are children of exile</i>

1004
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:48,193
<i>In this land or anywhere else</i>

1005
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:59,030
GOING HOME

1006
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:17,715
Who's there?

1007
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:02,395
- San Martín?
- It's me.

1008
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:05,156
Not going to give us a scare, are you?

1009
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:09,599
I'm not very well... at all.

1010
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,594
Don't you think it's time to go home?

1011
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:17,233
But how, General?

1012
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,833
I'm very weary and very poor.

1013
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:26,716
I understand, Gerardo.
I don't have a peso either.

1014
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:29,793
They've even forgotten my pension.

1015
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:35,399
But we must go back...
even if we don't feel like it.

1016
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:39,236
For a century and a half
I've been waiting...

1017
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:43,269
to see the fatherland
we've dreamt about.

1018
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:47,791
Great... united...

1019
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:51,028
To go back...

1020
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:54,676
Yes... with a furrowed brow.

1021
01:48:58,800 --> 01:48:59,949
Gardel!

1022
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:05,469
Of course... to go back.

1023
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:07,679
Have no doubts.

1024
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:12,229
It'll soon be time...
The country's decaying.

1025
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:14,235
You think so?

1026
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:21,633
It saddens me to see
they're not very patriotic.

1027
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:29,475
And you, Carlos?

1028
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:32,712
As you see, I'd like to go back.

1029
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:36,752
Will you sing us something?

1030
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:40,032
I don't sing anymore, General.
I'm old.

1031
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:52,914
<i>Going back...</i>
<i>with a furrowed brow</i>

1032
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:56,874
<i>My temples are silvered</i>
<i>by the snows of time</i>

1033
01:49:57,680 --> 01:50:03,516
<i>To feel...</i>
<i>that life is but a gust of wind</i>

1034
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:06,954
<i>That 20 years last</i>
<i>but a flash of lightning</i>

1035
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:14,158
I wasn't bad, was I...

1036
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:27,829
<i>I fear to meet the past</i>
<i>that is returning</i>

1037
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:30,759
<i>To confront my life.</i>

1038
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:35,753
<i>I fear the nights</i>
<i>peopled with memories</i>

1039
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:38,998
<i>That enchain my dreams</i>

1040
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:41,989
<i>But the voyager who flees</i>

1041
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:45,114
<i>Sooner or later ends his run</i>

1042
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:49,795
<i>Though oblivion which destroys all</i>

1043
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:53,710
<i>May shatter my old illusions</i>

1044
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,276
<i>I keep deep within me a humble hope</i>

1045
01:50:57,640 --> 01:51:01,519
<i>That is my heart's entire fortune...</i>

1046
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:08,479
<i>Years have slipped by</i>
<i>since those events.</i>

1047
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:14,349
<i>But so many things have happened</i>
<i>that the time seems very short.</i>

1048
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:21,394
<i>I've saved the memory of one night</i>
<i>before the cabin.</i>

1049
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:25,470
<i>When they all swore together</i>
<i>to return to Argentina.</i>

1050
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:29,354
<i>With songs and other magic</i>

1051
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:35,118
<i>and their longing to return, thus went</i>
<i>the nostalgia of the exile of Gardel.</i>

1052
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:56,276
<i>Almost all have returned</i>
<i>with their tangos and daily dramas.</i>

1053
01:51:57,040 --> 01:52:01,033
<i>Carrying away to their land</i>
<i>their exile in their flesh.</i>

1054
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:08,638
I barely know what I'll do.

1055
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,958
I come and go. I'm still here.

1056
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:17,119
One day I'll leave,
when I know who I am.

1057
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:22,275
But I've learnt this
from exile and suffering:

1058
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:25,510
We have so many years to live...

1059
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:29,915
No tragedy ever lasts... very long!
