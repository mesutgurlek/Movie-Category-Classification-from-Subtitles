Track 1
Dancing

16
00:02:10,327 --> 00:02:13,205
Have you heard the Bible:
'Thou shalt not kill.

17
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,164
'He who kills shall be judged'?

18
00:02:17,687 --> 00:02:20,679
I knew a guy with bad hearing.

19
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:24,077
He didn't hear
'thou shalt not kill. '

20
00:02:24,967 --> 00:02:27,162
Maybe because
he had headphones on.

21
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,678
He didn't hear
'thou shalt not kill. '

22
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:31,486
He took a spade,

23
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:34,042
went into his yard
and killed someone.

24
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:48,484
He came back, turned up the music
and danced.

25
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:53,077
The music was so funny
his dancing turned funny.

26
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:56,884
His shoulders went funny
and his feet,

27
00:02:57,207 --> 00:02:58,845
and his hair, and his eyes.

28
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:03,486
The dancing lured him
into a new land.

29
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:06,924
That land had nothing but movement,

30
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:11,677
only dancing and more dancing.

31
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:14,676
He decided to stay there for good.

32
00:03:15,287 --> 00:03:18,279
He decided not to spend
another minute

33
00:03:18,607 --> 00:03:20,598
without dancing.

34
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:22,679
Every person has two inner dancers:

35
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:24,799
One left and one right.

36
00:03:26,087 --> 00:03:27,918
Two lunging dancers. Two lungs.

37
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:29,720
The right lung and the left.

38
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:33,079
Every person has two dancers -
his right and left lung.

39
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,236
The lungs dance
and the person gets oxygen.

40
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:41,079
If you take a spade
and hit the chest area,

41
00:03:41,407 --> 00:03:44,922
the lungs stop dancing;
the oxygen stops.

42
00:04:43,687 --> 00:04:47,362
This guy knew all about dancing
but he had bad hearing.

43
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:51,921
He was dancing
when his friends came by.

44
00:04:53,847 --> 00:04:57,283
He did not hear them screaming,

45
00:04:58,127 --> 00:05:01,324
'Sanyok, you butchered your wife.

46
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:04,002
Have you lost it, shithead? '

47
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:06,520
But Sanyok didn't hear his friend

48
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:08,678
through the headphones.

49
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:11,362
Then his friend punched him
in the face,

50
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,439
in the stomach and the chest.

51
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:15,439
The chest dancers stopped

52
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:18,281
and Sanyok fell down,
gasping for oxygen.

53
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:21,841
Every person has two dancers:

54
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:23,879
One left and one right.

55
00:05:24,287 --> 00:05:25,686
Two lunging dancers.

56
00:05:26,007 --> 00:05:27,440
The right lung and the left.

57
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:31,282
Every person has two dancers -
his right and left lung.

58
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:34,077
The lungs dance
and the person gets oxygen.

59
00:05:34,407 --> 00:05:38,286
If you take a spade
and hit the chest area,

60
00:05:38,927 --> 00:05:42,283
the lungs stop dancing;
the oxygen stops.

61
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:57,486
Sanyok gasped for oxygen

62
00:05:58,087 --> 00:06:01,523
until he felt his chest dancers
move again.

63
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:05,836
He asked his friends,
'What do you want? '

64
00:06:06,287 --> 00:06:08,118
Then his friend who punched him

65
00:06:08,447 --> 00:06:11,280
asked again about the butchered wife
in the yard.

66
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:14,920
And when Sanyok understood,

67
00:06:18,447 --> 00:06:20,244
he said he whacked her with a spade

68
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:22,757
because he fell in love
with another woman.

69
00:06:23,087 --> 00:06:26,284
His wife had black hair.
The other was a redhead.

70
00:06:28,007 --> 00:06:29,645
The girl with black hair

71
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:32,686
and fat fingers had no oxygen.

72
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:35,679
The girl with red hair, thin fingers

73
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:39,363
and the man's name Sasha, did.

74
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:42,315
When Sanyok realized
his wife was not oxygen,

75
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:44,679
and the girl named Sasha was,

76
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:47,681
and when he realized
no one can live without it,

77
00:06:48,247 --> 00:06:49,726
he took the spade

78
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:52,686
and cut off the dancers legs
in his wife's chest.

79
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:57,246
Every person has two dancers:

80
00:06:57,687 --> 00:06:59,279
One left and one right.

81
00:06:59,607 --> 00:07:02,075
Two lunging dancers.
The right lung and the left.

82
00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:05,319
Every person has two dancers -
his right and left lung.

83
00:07:05,647 --> 00:07:08,036
The lungs dance
and the person gets oxygen.

84
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:12,077
If you take a spade
and hit the chest area,

85
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:15,965
the lungs stop dancing;
the oxygen stops.

86
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:20,164
Every woman contains two dancers

87
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:22,364
and every woman consumes oxygen,

88
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:24,962
but not every woman
is oxygen herself.

89
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:28,360
When mankind was told
'thou shalt not kill,'

90
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:30,838
there wasn't enough oxygen
for everyone.

91
00:07:31,287 --> 00:07:33,721
Some small-town Sanyok will always

92
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:39,599
want to dance, and will take a spade

93
00:07:40,007 --> 00:07:42,237
and kill his non-oxygen wife

94
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:44,804
so his lungs can breathe freely.

95
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:48,005
Because when it was said
'thou shalt not kill,'

96
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:49,965
he had his headphones on

97
00:07:50,287 --> 00:07:53,563
and dancers lured him into the land
of dancing and oxygen.

98
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:58,680
Whosoever sayeth unto his brother
'Raca-you're dead meat,'

99
00:07:59,007 --> 00:08:01,760
he shall be judged.
But whosoever sayeth 'You fool,'

100
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:03,964
shall be in danger of hell fire.

101
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:40,919
Track 2
Sasha loves Sasha

102
00:09:32,087 --> 00:09:35,204
Have you heard this?:
'Thou shalt not commit adultery';

103
00:09:35,527 --> 00:09:37,643
and 'Whosoever lusteth after a wife

104
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:39,878
hath committed adultery
in his heart. '

105
00:09:40,207 --> 00:09:42,357
Imagine how big
a man's heart must be

106
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:46,123
to embrace all the wives
he has lusted after.

107
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:48,246
That's no heart,

108
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:51,281
but a double bed
with sheets soaked in semen.

109
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:55,602
My small-town friend Sasha committed
adultery in his heart

110
00:09:56,007 --> 00:09:57,679
with the city girl Sasha,

111
00:09:58,007 --> 00:10:00,726
whom he first saw by a statue
on the square

112
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,239
as she smoked dope with her friends.

113
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:13,284
It is said, 'Thou shalt not look
at a woman with lust. '

114
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:16,281
This means: Do not commit adultery
in your heart.

115
00:10:16,687 --> 00:10:18,564
Those gazing at women with lust

116
00:10:18,927 --> 00:10:20,918
have their hearts locked
with a padlock.

117
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:25,280
He who lusts strives
not to fulfill a woman

118
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:27,285
but to empty himself.

119
00:10:28,287 --> 00:10:30,357
When my small-town friend, Sanyok,

120
00:10:30,687 --> 00:10:32,678
with the oxygen dancers
in his chest,

121
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,679
saw redheaded Sasha,

122
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:37,521
he wanted her so badly

123
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:42,444
his heart turned into a double bed
with white linen.

124
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:47,599
When he saw Sasha barefoot,

125
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:50,357
he experienced an oxygen overdose,

126
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,919
for an oxygen overdose
happens to those

127
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,278
suffering from oxygen famine.

128
00:10:57,527 --> 00:11:00,405
It is said, 'Thou shalt not look
at a woman with lust. '

129
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,321
This means do not commit adultery
in your heart.

130
00:11:03,687 --> 00:11:05,564
Those looking at women with lust

131
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:08,836
have their hearts locked
with a padlock.

132
00:11:10,447 --> 00:11:14,281
He who lusts strives
not to fulfill a woman

133
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:16,996
but to empty himself.

134
00:11:19,687 --> 00:11:21,405
Oxygen famine strikes those

135
00:11:21,927 --> 00:11:25,522
who breathe oxygen-poor air
for years,

136
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:28,517
who breathe women smelling of sweat

137
00:11:28,847 --> 00:11:30,280
and cheap perfume.

138
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,279
If you don't have money
for perfume,

139
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:36,283
you can always afford soap
and organic shampoo.

140
00:11:37,007 --> 00:11:38,486
If you don't have a fancy outfit,

141
00:11:38,807 --> 00:11:40,957
you can make a sundress yourself.

142
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:42,686
If you follow fashion magazines

143
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:46,677
and don't realize that fashion
reflects your inner world,

144
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:49,077
then perfume and soap and sundresses

145
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:51,398
will not fill the air with oxygen.

146
00:11:51,727 --> 00:11:53,365
Every man standing next to you

147
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:56,278
will experience oxygen famine.

148
00:11:57,527 --> 00:11:59,597
Sasha was entirely made of oxygen.

149
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,755
She wore a linen dress,
carried a bag

150
00:12:04,087 --> 00:12:06,282
wore string-sandals
and had big green eyes.

151
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:10,682
She had expensive
sunglasses and red hair.

152
00:12:11,527 --> 00:12:13,324
When you see a girl like that,

153
00:12:13,687 --> 00:12:15,359
you know this is 'oxygen. '

154
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:17,359
When you stand beside her,

155
00:12:17,847 --> 00:12:19,360
you smell expensive perfume,

156
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:21,678
soap and organic shampoo.

157
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,284
It is said, 'Thou shalt not look
at a woman with lust. '

158
00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:29,201
This means do not commit adultery
in your heart.

159
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,444
Those looking at women with lust

160
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:34,076
have their hearts locked
with a padlock.

161
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,679
He who lusts strives
not to fulfill a woman

162
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:41,079
but to empty himself.

163
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:43,245
'Lf thy right eye offend thee,

164
00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:45,757
pluck it out, and cast it from thee.

165
00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:49,681
Better that one
of thy members perish,

166
00:12:50,087 --> 00:12:51,964
than all thy body be cast to hell.

167
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,683
If thy right hand offend thee,

168
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,396
cut it off and cast it from thee. '

169
00:12:59,247 --> 00:13:02,683
For this reason,
when small-town Sanyok

170
00:13:03,447 --> 00:13:07,679
looked at his wife
not with love but with lust,

171
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,918
he hit her on the chest
with a spade

172
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:12,118
and stopped the dancing
in her lungs.

173
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:16,156
He cut out her eye
and cut off her hand,

174
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:18,955
for better that her
'members should perish'

175
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:24,077
than subject her
Body to fiery hell.

176
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:50,285
Track 3
Yeah and Nay

177
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:58,677
Have you heard:
'Swear not by heaven,

178
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:01,645
for it is God's seat;

179
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:04,402
nor by earth,
for it is his footstool;

180
00:14:04,807 --> 00:14:08,277
neither by Jerusalem,
for it is the city of the King. '

181
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:11,402
I do not know
the King ofJerusalem today.

182
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:14,157
Maybe there is no such person,

183
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,205
no one to bring order.

184
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,996
But I know I shall not swear
upon the city

185
00:14:20,447 --> 00:14:24,281
where people explode
like watermelons in buses

186
00:14:25,687 --> 00:14:27,518
and on squares
under the blazing sun.

187
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:33,078
But yea, this girl
with the man's name of Sasha,

188
00:14:33,687 --> 00:14:38,317
she swore by heaven twice
and once by earth.

189
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:42,679
First she swore
when a stranger kissed her

190
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:45,038
right in the middle of the street -

191
00:14:45,407 --> 00:14:46,726
not on the cheek,

192
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,566
nor the lips, nor the forehead,

193
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,240
nor the ear, nor the neck,

194
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:52,000
nor the shoulders, the chest,

195
00:14:52,327 --> 00:14:53,601
the back, the hips,

196
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:55,201
the ass, a leg -

197
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,199
none of these places I named,

198
00:14:57,607 --> 00:15:01,236
but he kissed her right
on the street in the middle of day.

199
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:04,326
She swore by heaven

200
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:06,205
not even a good joint

201
00:15:06,527 --> 00:15:08,404
could hit her as hard

202
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:10,365
as this scandalous kiss.

203
00:15:12,007 --> 00:15:14,123
The second time she swore by heaven

204
00:15:14,607 --> 00:15:17,838
when her strikingly handsome
husband asked:

205
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,520
'Are you cheating on me

206
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:21,360
with a small-town shithead? '

207
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:24,804
And she said: 'I swear to God, no. '

208
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,640
She swore by earth

209
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:31,045
when she vomited
for the first time in her life

210
00:15:31,407 --> 00:15:33,159
from the vodka and dumplings

211
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:35,318
she ate with friends of the guy

212
00:15:35,647 --> 00:15:37,797
with whom she cheated on
her husband.

213
00:15:38,127 --> 00:15:40,322
Never had she eaten
anything like that.

214
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:42,644
Right then she swore by the earth

215
00:15:43,007 --> 00:15:44,884
upon which she vomited,

216
00:15:45,207 --> 00:15:48,563
never again to eat such
deadly Russian food,

217
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:50,161
lacking all oxygen,

218
00:15:50,487 --> 00:15:53,604
filled with the nausea and pompous
pride of great empires.

219
00:15:58,527 --> 00:16:01,997
Better to smoke a joint,
eat apples and drink juice

220
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:04,204
than fall over drunk
next to a TV set,

221
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:06,597
swearing by heaven,
earth and Jerusalem

222
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:09,600
that you were seduced
by TV commercials,

223
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,963
instilling in your mind
what you must buy

224
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,006
in order to gain the right
to live on this earth.

225
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,839
And so, to have the right
to live on this earth...

226
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:22,563
one must learn to breathe air
and have money to buy that air

227
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:25,003
since once you get hooked on oxygen,

228
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:28,326
no money or drugs or even death

229
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:32,197
will replace the hunger
for beauty and freedom

230
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:34,995
you gain through it.

231
00:16:37,927 --> 00:16:39,246
My big-city friend Sasha

232
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:42,599
only twice swore by heaven
and once by the earth

233
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,202
but she swore her love
many times.

234
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:51,080
She had a big heart
like a double bed

235
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:54,922
with a fancy fruit and flower print.

236
00:16:56,687 --> 00:16:59,679
And every time she slept
with a new guy,

237
00:17:00,007 --> 00:17:01,281
not counting her husband,

238
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:03,837
,

239
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:07,204
these extra-marital encounters
were not random for her.

240
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,597
She experienced love in every one.

241
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:13,165
Every time she was alone with a man

242
00:17:13,927 --> 00:17:15,918
and listened to
his thoughts on love,

243
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:18,078
her head filled with words like his.

244
00:17:18,407 --> 00:17:22,685
The city-girl Sasha
never spoke them aloud,

245
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:25,282
but expressed her feelings
through a smile,

246
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:29,282
a turn of the head
or a mischievous wink.

247
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:31,040
My friend Sasha

248
00:17:31,607 --> 00:17:35,122
always acted like an actress
in a movie about love.

249
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:38,486
Only these relationships
between a man and a woman

250
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,081
contain oxygen.

251
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:43,601
If you swear love and allegiance
and feel nothing,

252
00:17:43,927 --> 00:17:45,599
that's no oxygen film,
that's dog shit.

253
00:17:45,927 --> 00:17:49,556
If you love but don't swear by it,
that's like German porno.

254
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:52,999
If you sleep with many men
but only love one,

255
00:17:53,327 --> 00:17:55,204
that's like true Russian cinema

256
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:57,563
with birch trees
and rolling fields.

257
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:02,836
Better smoke a joint,
eat apples and drink juice

258
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,402
than fall over drunk
next to a TV set,

259
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:07,922
swearing by heaven,
earth and Jerusalem

260
00:18:08,247 --> 00:18:10,715
that your heart belongs
to one person

261
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:14,278
and your body to another.

262
00:18:14,687 --> 00:18:16,917
What then is left to swear by?

263
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:19,917
Not by God's seat,
nor his footstool,

264
00:18:20,247 --> 00:18:21,999
and definitely not Jerusalem,

265
00:18:22,607 --> 00:18:24,996
where people have gone mad
from stupidity,

266
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:27,279
but only by your own love.

267
00:18:27,687 --> 00:18:29,882
'May your words be, yea, yea:
Nay, nay.

268
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:31,640
For anything more than that

269
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:34,601
cometh of evil. '

270
00:18:57,687 --> 00:18:59,996
Track 4
Moscow Rum

271
00:19:30,407 --> 00:19:32,477
Have you heard, 'Resist not wrong.

272
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,598
But whosoever strike thee
on thy cheek,

273
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,241
turn him the other.

274
00:19:37,767 --> 00:19:40,804
And if a man sue thee and
take thy coat,

275
00:19:41,207 --> 00:19:42,879
give him thy cloak also. '

276
00:19:43,207 --> 00:19:44,879
With no regard to the law,

277
00:19:45,207 --> 00:19:48,119
the girl I'm talking about
threw her clothes off

278
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,599
when a man she liked gave her
Moscow Rum and Coke,

279
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:54,839
and offered him a big,
fancy double bed.

280
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:59,201
But when one man struck her
on the cheek,

281
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:02,764
she refused to offer the left.

282
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:05,767
She went to his kitchen

283
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:08,675
where she took a knife

284
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,840
and returned to the bedroom

285
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:15,000
to stab him in the face.

286
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,838
The man caught her arm

287
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:20,323
and slapped her on the other cheek.

288
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:22,325
He smacked her so hard

289
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:24,200
that her nose bled

290
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:26,359
as if a fresh stream ran,

291
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,726
a red spring stream

292
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:33,000
in the middle of winter.

293
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,997
In the dead of winter
they took the train to Serpukhov.

294
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:38,760
Peddlers were selling papers,

295
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:43,080
batteries and pens.

296
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:45,967
They went to Serpukhov,
the hometown of Sanyok,

297
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:50,203
where people fall down drunk
in the middle of the day.

298
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:54,199
Where streets and houses
are full of youths

299
00:20:54,527 --> 00:20:56,643
sticking needles in their veins.

300
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:59,037
They wanted to dance
where this guy danced

301
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:02,200
before he butchered his wife
with a spade.

302
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,085
None spoke of this to the police.

303
00:21:04,607 --> 00:21:07,599
No one had any idea,

304
00:21:08,007 --> 00:21:10,441
especially our girl Sasha,

305
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:12,605
who had inspired this deed.

306
00:21:12,927 --> 00:21:15,077
His wife, the woman with black hair,

307
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,763
now slept in the Serpukhov earth.

308
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:22,325
Oxygen was of no use to her now.

309
00:21:23,607 --> 00:21:25,677
When this girl Sasha
stepped off the train,

310
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:28,757
she immediately sized the town up.

311
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:32,204
Later she made a snowman
in the yard

312
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:34,995
and listened to music
with headphones on.

313
00:21:35,847 --> 00:21:38,236
When Sanyok from Serpukhov
visited Moscow,

314
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:42,997
he saw snobs
and heard accents,

315
00:21:43,327 --> 00:21:45,522
and knew
there were not enough spades

316
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:48,361
or earth to handle
this swarming mass,

317
00:21:48,687 --> 00:21:52,839
suffocating without oxygen
under the ozone-aerosol void.

318
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:56,280
No fancy glasses will help you see

319
00:21:57,527 --> 00:22:00,883
self-respect in a drunken girl

320
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:02,925
wearing black shoes and white socks.

321
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:05,841
Those punks squatting
near the liquor store

322
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:08,601
will never make a worthy
generation of young men.

323
00:22:11,407 --> 00:22:13,796
When she walked in her
European dress

324
00:22:14,127 --> 00:22:15,845
down the town streets

325
00:22:16,207 --> 00:22:17,879
where movies are made
about the Revolution

326
00:22:18,047 --> 00:22:19,924
because this place
is frozen in time,

327
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:23,124
even the dogs are ashamed
of their small-town coats.

328
00:22:23,327 --> 00:22:26,763
Fleas on dogs
from Moscow and Serpukhov

329
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:29,163
have different ancestors.

330
00:22:29,287 --> 00:22:32,199
Moscow fleas bit the dog
of Stanislavsky.

331
00:22:32,287 --> 00:22:34,039
But Serpukhov fleas

332
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:37,437
bit Uncle Sergei's bitch.

333
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:40,599
Sergei ate those fleas

334
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:44,476
as a homeopathic remedy

335
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:46,320
for tuberculosis.

336
00:22:48,607 --> 00:22:50,677
If you want to say
which is best,

337
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:52,405
then you must solve
the issue

338
00:22:52,487 --> 00:22:55,285
of the greatest city on earth -
Jerusalem.

339
00:22:56,487 --> 00:22:58,318
Then you go back to the trivial,

340
00:22:58,647 --> 00:23:01,241
like which country you prefer,
Moscow or Russia.

341
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,520
For if a single Jew drives a tank
across the river

342
00:23:04,847 --> 00:23:06,405
where John did his baptizing,

343
00:23:06,727 --> 00:23:08,877
then anyone, even those
lacking superstition,

344
00:23:09,207 --> 00:23:12,358
know explosions will follow
in otherJewish towns.

345
00:23:12,687 --> 00:23:14,086
That is as true as
martins flying

346
00:23:14,407 --> 00:23:17,205
low to the ground
before rainstorms.

347
00:23:17,527 --> 00:23:19,722
That is as true
as town dwellers

348
00:23:20,207 --> 00:23:22,038
believing themselves inferior

349
00:23:22,447 --> 00:23:25,883
because the Moscow flea
gives him no peace,

350
00:23:28,087 --> 00:23:32,285
and an unknown power makes him
tuck his sweater in his pants.

351
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:36,836
I think your Sasha
should go fuck herself.

352
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:40,756
I think your Sasha
should go fuck himself.

353
00:23:58,087 --> 00:24:00,999
'May ye be the children
of your heavenly Father:

354
00:24:01,327 --> 00:24:03,682
For he maketh the sun rise
on evil and good. '

355
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:06,043
'And sendeth rain
on the just and unjust.

356
00:24:06,367 --> 00:24:09,757
For if ye love them which love you:
What reward shall ye have? '

357
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:11,998
None.

358
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:15,683
Absolutely none.

359
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:22,439
How do I feel about drugs?

360
00:26:24,007 --> 00:26:25,281
I have a great story...

361
00:26:25,607 --> 00:26:27,677
I was with a friend
in the United Emirates.

362
00:26:28,207 --> 00:26:29,959
Snorting heroin, so to speak...

363
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:33,402
I snorted heroin,
ripped up my passport

364
00:26:34,847 --> 00:26:36,724
and went to the Arab market.

365
00:26:39,447 --> 00:26:42,325
I don't speak Arabic,
so there was no way back.

366
00:26:57,727 --> 00:26:59,319
You have heard it said:

367
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:04,721
'Take heed that ye do not
your alms before men,

368
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,402
to be seen of them.

369
00:27:08,407 --> 00:27:10,238
When thou doest thine alms,

370
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:13,198
sound not a trumpet before thee,

371
00:27:13,527 --> 00:27:16,519
as hypocrites do
in the synagogues and streets

372
00:27:17,207 --> 00:27:18,765
that they may have glory of men. '

373
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:24,925
When the city girl Sasha gave alms

374
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:29,361
to small-town Sanyok
from Serpukhov,

375
00:27:31,287 --> 00:27:33,323
this happened not on the street

376
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:36,084
and certainly in no synagogue,

377
00:27:37,527 --> 00:27:39,597
but under the sheets

378
00:27:41,207 --> 00:27:42,845
in a dark room

379
00:27:44,207 --> 00:27:45,925
behind closed doors.

380
00:27:49,607 --> 00:27:51,279
And when, in return,

381
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:53,325
Sanyok from Serpukhov

382
00:27:54,527 --> 00:27:56,836
gave his alms to Sasha from Moscow,

383
00:27:59,007 --> 00:28:01,202
these were the best moments
of her life

384
00:28:03,327 --> 00:28:06,364
for when she received
such alms from her husband,

385
00:28:07,407 --> 00:28:10,604
the handsome brunet
from a theater school,

386
00:28:11,207 --> 00:28:13,516
he did it with an expression
on his face

387
00:28:14,407 --> 00:28:17,843
as if it all was transpiring
on a busy street

388
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:22,084
or in a synagogue at Passover

389
00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:26,405
rather than under the colorful
sheets of a bed.

390
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:31,722
When Alexander gave alms
to Alexandra for the first time,

391
00:28:33,887 --> 00:28:36,720
only then did he see in her eyes

392
00:28:37,207 --> 00:28:40,438
that she visited him
just for such alms.

393
00:28:41,607 --> 00:28:44,201
For the receiving of alms

394
00:28:45,927 --> 00:28:49,203
from men was her favorite hobby.

395
00:28:58,847 --> 00:29:02,760
Track 5
Arab World

396
00:29:58,207 --> 00:30:01,358
'Love' and 'insanity'
are as different

397
00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:04,440
as the religious consciousness

398
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:07,156
of an Iraqi Muslim

399
00:30:07,607 --> 00:30:09,199
and an American Jew.

400
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:23,120
The sight of a fat woman in pants

401
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:26,206
stuffing her face with hotdogs

402
00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:29,487
is as revolting to a Muslim

403
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:41,120
as it was for David Hoffermann

404
00:30:41,487 --> 00:30:42,761
to find a woman's hair

405
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:44,759
on his windowsill on September 11,

406
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:47,840
after the owner of this hair,

407
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:00,998
a blonde fat woman

408
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:02,601
who wore pants,

409
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,201
was sent to Muslim hell

410
00:31:04,607 --> 00:31:06,199
because she had undigested pork

411
00:31:06,527 --> 00:31:08,199
in her stomach.

412
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,600
If we follow this logic

413
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:25,005
and compare 'insanity' with pork,
and 'love' with Jihad,

414
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:31,001
then the spade

415
00:31:31,607 --> 00:31:34,201
which sliced open the head
of an ugly woman

416
00:31:34,687 --> 00:31:36,757
equals the sword of Allah,

417
00:31:37,247 --> 00:31:38,760
punishing wrongdoers

418
00:31:39,087 --> 00:31:40,566
for consuming pork,

419
00:31:41,047 --> 00:31:42,799
and is not a garden tool

420
00:31:43,127 --> 00:31:44,640
for digging potatoes

421
00:31:44,967 --> 00:31:47,037
or eliminating unwanted wives.

422
00:32:12,727 --> 00:32:14,001
In fact,

423
00:32:14,327 --> 00:32:15,919
everything in the world

424
00:32:16,287 --> 00:32:17,845
stems from two things:

425
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:24,481
Insane love,

426
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:27,204
that is, a love of such power

427
00:32:27,687 --> 00:32:29,359
it makes a person insane;

428
00:32:36,007 --> 00:32:37,281
From two things:

429
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:39,566
Insane love

430
00:32:40,847 --> 00:32:42,599
and a hunger for air.

431
00:32:46,287 --> 00:32:48,039
In fact love and suffocation

432
00:32:50,287 --> 00:32:52,005
are one and the same thing.

433
00:32:52,567 --> 00:32:54,319
If you don't understand that

434
00:32:55,127 --> 00:32:56,685
then don't utter words

435
00:32:58,087 --> 00:32:59,361
like

436
00:33:02,087 --> 00:33:03,361
'Islam'

437
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:05,681
and 'New York. '

438
00:33:09,767 --> 00:33:11,325
For only 'insane love'

439
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:13,439
can justify 'insane hatred'

440
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:15,361
and vice versa.

441
00:33:28,287 --> 00:33:30,755
There is just one step
between love and hate.

442
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:33,237
For love of God
Islamic extremists

443
00:33:33,687 --> 00:33:35,359
fly planes into buildings,

444
00:33:35,687 --> 00:33:37,245
take children hostage

445
00:33:37,607 --> 00:33:39,120
and kill the unholy.

446
00:33:39,607 --> 00:33:41,484
They do it for the love of Allah.

447
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:43,639
And only for the love of God

448
00:33:44,007 --> 00:33:46,396
do Jews bomb
peaceful Arab settlements

449
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:48,365
and do Christians hang

450
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:50,883
the leaders of non-Christian states

451
00:33:51,207 --> 00:33:52,481
who are infamy

452
00:33:52,887 --> 00:33:54,366
to Christ Almighty.

453
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:09,839
'We only kill the ones we love' -

454
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:20,846
that should be inscribed

455
00:34:21,967 --> 00:34:23,605
in ornate Arabic letters

456
00:34:24,287 --> 00:34:25,766
on the Shahid belts

457
00:34:26,087 --> 00:34:27,520
ofJihad warriors.

458
00:34:42,687 --> 00:34:45,281
In order to say something
that grabs you...

459
00:34:46,607 --> 00:34:49,679
I'll tell you the truth.

460
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:52,806
The problem is not that

461
00:34:53,207 --> 00:34:56,279
the poor Arabs are locked
in a no-win situation

462
00:34:56,767 --> 00:34:59,281
and that Jewish children
are not to blame for this.

463
00:34:59,727 --> 00:35:03,083
And it's not because

464
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:07,276
you can be thrown
in a Russian prison

465
00:35:07,687 --> 00:35:10,963
for five years for possessing
a handful of weed,

466
00:35:11,287 --> 00:35:14,643
when for vodka,
which has destroyed a nation

467
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:18,084
and makes men hit their
pregnant wives in the stomach,

468
00:35:18,487 --> 00:35:21,285
you spend the night in detox
and go home a hero.

469
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:24,918
The real problem is

470
00:35:25,287 --> 00:35:28,677
that you do not know how
to love people.

471
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:31,885
The true lie is that
you know nothing

472
00:35:32,367 --> 00:35:34,676
about some Sanyok from Serpukhov.

473
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,965
You couldn't care less how he lives
and who he might kill,

474
00:35:38,287 --> 00:35:41,438
but you will cry your eyes out,

475
00:35:41,847 --> 00:35:44,884
telling the story
of someone else's life.

476
00:35:45,207 --> 00:35:47,846
You'll suffer over something
that just doesn't exist.

477
00:35:48,287 --> 00:35:51,279
That is the problem.

478
00:35:51,927 --> 00:35:55,283
And that is truly your problem.

479
00:35:55,607 --> 00:35:57,677
Artistically-minded people

480
00:35:58,847 --> 00:36:00,963
only contemplate their own problems.

481
00:36:02,087 --> 00:36:04,203
I would never believe you if you say

482
00:36:05,287 --> 00:36:07,642
you can't sleep at night

483
00:36:08,687 --> 00:36:11,565
because a Moscow bum
is freezing to death.

484
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:15,284
That's a lie!

485
00:36:15,687 --> 00:36:18,485
It's a lie that you snorted heroin

486
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,680
and wandered around a market
in the Arab Emirates.

487
00:36:22,087 --> 00:36:25,443
It's a lie. You never were there.

488
00:36:25,927 --> 00:36:28,157
You would never snort heroin,

489
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:31,927
because your friends
know how rational you are.

490
00:36:32,287 --> 00:36:34,676
You're only good for staying

491
00:36:37,087 --> 00:36:39,282
in your room with the lights off,

492
00:36:39,927 --> 00:36:42,839
listening to Radiohead
for the thousandth time,

493
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:46,079
jerking off and imagining yourself

494
00:36:46,407 --> 00:36:49,240
in white robes at an Arab market.

495
00:40:43,687 --> 00:40:44,961
Track 7 Amnesia

496
00:40:53,807 --> 00:40:56,799
It was said:
'Judge not, lest ye be judged. '

497
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:59,886
That was said to justify
memory loss.

498
00:41:00,527 --> 00:41:01,846
In other words,

499
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:05,682
if someone loses a loved one
to a gunshot to the head,

500
00:41:06,087 --> 00:41:08,965
they can only 'judge not' him
who did the shooting

501
00:41:09,287 --> 00:41:10,845
if they forget the killer exists.

502
00:41:11,287 --> 00:41:15,678
Forget guns, killers and loved ones.

503
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:19,317
Don't pretend you forgot -
forget for real,

504
00:41:20,127 --> 00:41:22,004
induce clinical amnesia
in your brain.

505
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:25,078
Transform your brain into:

506
00:41:25,407 --> 00:41:28,922
'I remember nothing. '
And that's that.

507
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:44,080
'Judge not, lest ye be judged. '

508
00:41:44,927 --> 00:41:47,646
Forget those who murdered you

509
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:50,197
and those you murdered.

510
00:41:50,527 --> 00:41:53,166
I remember nothing and no one.

511
00:41:53,487 --> 00:41:55,205
Who murdered me?
I don't remember.

512
00:41:55,527 --> 00:41:56,960
Did I kill? I don't remember.

513
00:41:58,007 --> 00:42:02,125
I remember nothing and no one.
And that's that.

514
00:42:02,447 --> 00:42:05,166
In some ancient tongue,

515
00:42:05,487 --> 00:42:07,682
'to judge' means to 'forget'

516
00:42:08,087 --> 00:42:11,318
but I don't recall
what tongue that is.

517
00:42:11,967 --> 00:42:14,322
'Judge not' means 'see not. '

518
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:17,918
But I don't recall
which translation that is.

519
00:42:18,447 --> 00:42:23,282
If I am asked, 'What did you try
so hard to say? '

520
00:42:23,927 --> 00:42:26,600
I shall answer, 'I don't recall -
I have amnesia. '

521
00:42:27,327 --> 00:42:31,081
If I am asked, 'What did you
wish to say? '

522
00:42:32,567 --> 00:42:35,286
I shall answer,
'I don't know what you ask. '

523
00:42:35,607 --> 00:42:37,677
'I don't know what you ask. '

524
00:42:49,087 --> 00:42:51,203
If I hear,

525
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,280
'Who is this redhead with thin,
pale fingers?

526
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:56,804
Did you say she was 'Oxygen'?

527
00:42:57,127 --> 00:42:59,880
I shall answer, 'I don't know
her or what she wants.

528
00:43:00,207 --> 00:43:02,846
That girl died two years ago

529
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:06,365
after riding the smallest
Ferris Wheel in the world. '

530
00:43:06,687 --> 00:43:10,282
If you want my opinion
of Sasha from Moscow,

531
00:43:10,607 --> 00:43:12,359
I will quote one of the gods:

532
00:43:12,687 --> 00:43:14,564
'Let the dead bury their dead. '

533
00:43:14,887 --> 00:43:16,161
If I am asked,

534
00:43:16,487 --> 00:43:19,957
'Who butchered his wife
in the yard? '

535
00:43:20,287 --> 00:43:21,640
And what happened to him? '

536
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:26,643
I won't answer. I couldn't care less.

537
00:43:27,487 --> 00:43:30,843
That guy died two years ago

538
00:43:31,367 --> 00:43:33,005
for it was August,

539
00:43:34,087 --> 00:43:36,157
and August is
the deadliest month.

540
00:43:36,767 --> 00:43:38,280
When I asked my friend,

541
00:43:38,687 --> 00:43:42,282
'Where is the greatest
Ferris Wheel on earth? '

542
00:43:42,607 --> 00:43:43,926
She said 'I don't know. '

543
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:45,521
I said it must be in London

544
00:43:45,847 --> 00:43:47,326
and that's as true as the fact

545
00:43:47,647 --> 00:43:49,444
that I rode one myself with friends.

546
00:43:49,767 --> 00:43:51,598
When I asked my friend,

547
00:43:51,927 --> 00:43:54,521
'Where on earth
is the Valley of Death? '

548
00:43:55,047 --> 00:43:56,321
He said 'I don't know. '

549
00:43:56,647 --> 00:43:58,683
I said, it's in Kazakhstan

550
00:43:59,007 --> 00:44:00,759
and that is as true as the fact

551
00:44:01,087 --> 00:44:03,476
that I flew over that country
in a chopper myself.

552
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,081
When my friend asked,

553
00:44:05,407 --> 00:44:06,965
'Where is

554
00:44:07,287 --> 00:44:09,437
the smallest Ferris Wheel on earth? '

555
00:44:09,767 --> 00:44:11,041
I answered, 'I don't know. '

556
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:13,278
She said it was in her hand

557
00:44:13,607 --> 00:44:15,962
and showed me
a tiny pill in her palm.

558
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:18,084
Then she swallowed it.

559
00:44:18,487 --> 00:44:20,842
When my friend asked,

560
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:24,284
'Where on earth
is another Valley of Death? '

561
00:44:25,207 --> 00:44:26,606
I answered, 'I don't know. '

562
00:44:26,927 --> 00:44:29,521
He said 'It's here
in a field of wormwood'

563
00:44:29,847 --> 00:44:31,200
and he ran into the field.

564
00:44:31,527 --> 00:44:33,722
But he was allergic to wormwood,

565
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:37,437
and he had asthma,

566
00:44:38,247 --> 00:44:40,886
so he didn't make it
halfway through the field.

567
00:44:41,207 --> 00:44:43,357
He fell,
the dancers fell still in his chest,

568
00:44:43,687 --> 00:44:45,803
and he fell into
an eternal allergic sleep.

569
00:44:46,327 --> 00:44:50,081
Because the pill had a high content
of psychotropic drugs,

570
00:44:50,447 --> 00:44:52,677
and because my friend's health

571
00:44:53,007 --> 00:44:56,556
wouldn't let her play
with such things,

572
00:44:57,287 --> 00:44:58,561
she fell on the ground,

573
00:44:59,047 --> 00:45:01,277
her chest dancers fell still

574
00:45:02,127 --> 00:45:05,278
and she fell
into eternal psychotropic sleep,

575
00:45:05,847 --> 00:45:12,286
as if she fell off the smallest
Ferris Wheel.

576
00:45:26,127 --> 00:45:29,278
When everyone wants to talk
about friends

577
00:45:29,607 --> 00:45:31,040
who died in a wormwood field,

578
00:45:31,367 --> 00:45:34,677
they talk about their love
of small-town Sanyok.

579
00:45:35,647 --> 00:45:39,686
When they want to talk
about a girl who overdosed,

580
00:45:40,727 --> 00:45:43,195
they talk
about the big-city girl Sasha.

581
00:45:43,567 --> 00:45:47,276
When people ask,
'Who is he to you? '

582
00:45:47,927 --> 00:45:50,282
You say, 'I forget,'
so as not to judge.

583
00:45:50,687 --> 00:45:54,680
When they ask,
'Why did you forget everything? '

584
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:57,237
You tell them the truth
for the first time.

585
00:45:58,127 --> 00:45:59,640
Because I have -

586
00:46:00,887 --> 00:46:02,957
Amnesia.

587
00:46:21,247 --> 00:46:22,805
Track 8
Fourth Day

588
00:46:23,967 --> 00:46:28,677
'There are six days
when you may work,

589
00:46:29,007 --> 00:46:32,397
but the seventh day
is a Sabbath of rest to the LORD.'

590
00:46:33,247 --> 00:46:36,284
Today my Lord
will be left with nothing.

591
00:46:36,807 --> 00:46:39,480
No one will think of the Lord today

592
00:46:40,287 --> 00:46:43,279
for today is Thursday,
not Saturday.

593
00:47:05,087 --> 00:47:07,237
Let God wait a few more days,

594
00:47:07,567 --> 00:47:10,127
today is Thursday,
tomorrow - Friday.

595
00:47:10,607 --> 00:47:13,075
The day after tomorrow
will be God's day.

596
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,080
The day after tomorrow is God's day

597
00:47:16,527 --> 00:47:18,279
but today is a regular day -
Thursday.

598
00:47:18,607 --> 00:47:21,838
There's no room for God
in the middle of the week.

599
00:47:22,527 --> 00:47:23,846
Today is Thursday,

600
00:47:24,167 --> 00:47:25,680
there are two days left to God.

601
00:47:26,407 --> 00:47:28,079
We'll have to wait a little longer.

602
00:47:28,407 --> 00:47:32,525
For tomorrow is Friday
and God is only for Saturdays.

603
00:47:33,367 --> 00:47:36,439
God is only for weekends,
for days off.

604
00:47:37,127 --> 00:47:39,083
During the week
we don't worship him.

605
00:47:39,407 --> 00:47:40,965
On Thursdays we don't turn to God.

606
00:47:41,287 --> 00:47:42,959
We learned that long ago.

607
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:45,160
All week long we work without God.

608
00:47:45,567 --> 00:47:48,365
On Saturday we rest
and God rests among us.

609
00:47:49,607 --> 00:47:50,960
Only Saturday has meaning

610
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:53,164
and there is no meaning
outside Saturday.

611
00:47:53,487 --> 00:47:55,682
Only Saturday in relation
to Thursday has meaning.

612
00:47:56,007 --> 00:47:58,282
Without this, meaning
makes no sense.

613
00:47:58,607 --> 00:48:01,280
Meaning loses meaning
when you say

614
00:48:01,607 --> 00:48:04,075
aloud what you really mean to say.

615
00:48:04,407 --> 00:48:06,443
Meaning loses meaning
if you write

616
00:48:06,847 --> 00:48:08,838
what you truly want to write.

617
00:48:09,167 --> 00:48:12,842
Meaning loses meaning
when you evaluate a situation.

618
00:48:13,287 --> 00:48:14,800
Looking for meaning in meaning

619
00:48:15,127 --> 00:48:16,719
is rude and uncultured.

620
00:48:17,047 --> 00:48:19,845
- Culture lacks any meaning.
- As does art.

621
00:48:20,287 --> 00:48:23,006
- Only the vulgar don't get that.
- Or criminals.

622
00:48:23,327 --> 00:48:25,887
- Or both.
- Only Saturday has meaning.

623
00:48:26,207 --> 00:48:28,243
There is no meaning
outside of Saturday.

624
00:48:28,727 --> 00:48:30,285
Saturday in relation to Thursday.

625
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:32,479
Only Saturday has meaning

626
00:48:32,967 --> 00:48:35,401
There is no meaning
outside of Saturday.

627
00:48:35,727 --> 00:48:37,126
Saturday in relation to Thursday?

628
00:50:37,887 --> 00:50:39,684
Track 9
The Essence ofThings

629
00:50:45,527 --> 00:50:47,677
'Gather ye no treasure
upon the earth

630
00:50:48,007 --> 00:50:49,565
where rust and moths corrupt,

631
00:50:49,887 --> 00:50:51,718
and thieves break in and steal. '

632
00:50:52,567 --> 00:50:54,398
'But gather ye treasure in heaven

633
00:50:54,727 --> 00:50:56,604
where neither rust
nor moths corrupt,

634
00:50:56,927 --> 00:50:59,043
and thieves neither break in
nor steal. '

635
00:51:19,287 --> 00:51:20,720
The heavens are the essence,

636
00:51:21,047 --> 00:51:22,878
for people
cross heavens on airplanes

637
00:51:23,207 --> 00:51:24,526
from country to country.

638
00:51:24,887 --> 00:51:26,240
Airplanes are essential,

639
00:51:26,687 --> 00:51:28,166
for when they fall from the sky

640
00:51:28,487 --> 00:51:30,159
they fulfill ancient prophecies.

641
00:51:30,727 --> 00:51:32,001
People are essential

642
00:51:32,327 --> 00:51:35,797
for their deeds bring
the end of the earth nearer.

643
00:51:36,127 --> 00:51:37,446
The earth is essential,

644
00:51:37,767 --> 00:51:40,076
for the bodies of war victims
are buried in it.

645
00:51:40,407 --> 00:51:41,681
War is essential,

646
00:51:42,087 --> 00:51:44,681
for without it,
men would not be fit.

647
00:51:45,087 --> 00:51:47,078
Women would not make themselves
look pretty,

648
00:51:47,407 --> 00:51:50,365
to make men shatter
each other's skulls with guns.

649
00:51:50,727 --> 00:51:52,001
Guns are essential for

650
00:51:52,767 --> 00:51:55,281
for they keep the death toll steady.

651
00:51:55,607 --> 00:51:58,280
The dead, especially, are essential

652
00:51:58,687 --> 00:52:01,042
for the construction
of new war memorials

653
00:52:01,927 --> 00:52:04,680
and other works of art
made in their honor.

654
00:52:05,007 --> 00:52:06,281
Honor is essential,

655
00:52:06,607 --> 00:52:08,438
it makes men
throw themselves on knives

656
00:52:08,767 --> 00:52:12,157
and women terminate sons
in their wombs.

657
00:52:12,487 --> 00:52:15,684
Sons are essential.
And daughters too, of course.

658
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:17,839
Children serve
the essence of things.

659
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:19,486
That's why they enter this world.

660
00:52:19,927 --> 00:52:21,724
Kindergarten
and the lessons they skip -

661
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,161
it's all essential.

662
00:52:23,487 --> 00:52:25,284
The money they steal
from their parents,

663
00:52:25,607 --> 00:52:27,802
their first cigarettes,

664
00:52:28,127 --> 00:52:30,880
and breaking into someone's
house for the first time

665
00:52:31,207 --> 00:52:32,845
it is all in the essence of things.

666
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:36,284
The essence of things
is scientists making discoveries

667
00:52:36,607 --> 00:52:38,279
and criminals robbing a store.

668
00:52:38,607 --> 00:52:41,679
Essence is in the hands
of musicians playing Mozart

669
00:52:42,007 --> 00:52:43,804
and philatelists collecting stamps.

670
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:45,401
The essence of things

671
00:52:45,727 --> 00:52:47,763
is in Michelangelo
and graffiti on walls.

672
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:49,959
For it you hate your parents

673
00:52:50,287 --> 00:52:51,766
and slap your child on the face.

674
00:52:52,087 --> 00:52:53,361
For essences

675
00:52:53,687 --> 00:52:55,325
you throw cigarette butts
into flower pots

676
00:52:55,647 --> 00:52:58,684
and drink up the money
for your son's new bike.

677
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,998
You don't have children
for that reason.

678
00:53:01,327 --> 00:53:04,125
- You shoot a cat.
- You love, you hate, you kill

679
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:06,403
only for the essence of things.

680
00:53:06,727 --> 00:53:08,524
You accuse,
you gossip and torture

681
00:53:08,847 --> 00:53:10,121
for the same great thing.

682
00:53:10,447 --> 00:53:12,403
- Why else would you do it?
- You shoot heroin

683
00:53:12,727 --> 00:53:14,285
and buy tickets to concerts of Bach

684
00:53:14,607 --> 00:53:16,279
and help a blind man
cross the street.

685
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:18,279
All for that
main essential thing.

686
00:53:18,607 --> 00:53:21,201
You give alms to the poor,
you follow politics

687
00:53:21,567 --> 00:53:23,125
and you slit your wrists for it.

688
00:53:23,847 --> 00:53:25,678
You speak on behalf
of the essence of things

689
00:53:26,007 --> 00:53:28,885
- and you can't stop talking.
- For the essence of things

690
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:31,084
you stop
and ask the essential question.

691
00:55:01,927 --> 00:55:03,201
Stop.

692
00:55:20,287 --> 00:55:22,596
What is most important for you?

693
00:55:25,487 --> 00:55:26,761
You go first.

694
00:55:27,807 --> 00:55:30,241
It sounds crass, you go first.

695
00:55:31,767 --> 00:55:34,520
Same for me. You start, I'll finish.

696
00:55:35,367 --> 00:55:39,280
In school you probably played doctor
with a girl.

697
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,561
Yes, and you?

698
00:55:54,287 --> 00:55:55,561
'Advertisement'

699
00:55:55,927 --> 00:55:57,326
My girl was good all week.

700
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,678
She was doing big things.

701
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:01,839
Now comes her reward.

702
00:56:02,807 --> 00:56:04,479
Mushrooms from Leningrad -

703
00:56:05,287 --> 00:56:06,720
My favorite thing.

704
00:56:07,607 --> 00:56:09,802
Mushrooms from Leningrad,
yeah, yeah...

705
00:56:10,007 --> 00:56:11,599
The express train comes in Monday.

706
00:56:12,167 --> 00:56:13,919
My friend won't bring us booze,

707
00:56:14,047 --> 00:56:15,560
he doesn't smoke or drink

708
00:56:15,847 --> 00:56:17,166
but is a computer nerd.

709
00:56:17,247 --> 00:56:19,124
His mushrooms
will blow your mind.

710
00:56:21,567 --> 00:56:23,364
You missed a good film Tuesday.

711
00:56:24,007 --> 00:56:25,679
The film was pretty shitty,

712
00:56:26,607 --> 00:56:28,165
but I was flying high.

713
00:56:29,127 --> 00:56:30,640
Oh man, how I love mushrooms!

714
00:56:31,767 --> 00:56:36,443
'Dried Mushrooms
from St. Petersburg. '

715
00:56:37,007 --> 00:56:39,521
- So what's essential for you?
- Same as for you.

716
00:56:40,087 --> 00:56:42,521
I'm leaving if you say 'Oxygen. '

717
00:56:43,087 --> 00:56:44,884
Don't think I'm dumber than you.

718
00:56:45,207 --> 00:56:47,198
- Then what is it?
- You first.

719
00:56:47,527 --> 00:56:50,360
It's crass and embarrassing.

720
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,518
- You go first.
- Same for me.

721
00:56:52,847 --> 00:56:54,280
You start and I'll finish.

722
00:56:54,607 --> 00:56:56,120
In school you probably played doctor

723
00:56:56,447 --> 00:56:58,722
- with a girl.
- Yes, and you?

724
00:56:59,047 --> 00:57:00,605
- Conscience.
- It's the same for me.

725
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,599
- Conscience.
- Same for me.

726
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:05,237
- Conscience.
- Same for me.

727
00:57:10,767 --> 00:57:12,405
Track 10
Where Would I Be

728
00:57:14,687 --> 00:57:16,723
Where would I be

729
00:57:17,047 --> 00:57:19,720
if a nurse didn't smack me
when I was born,

730
00:57:20,287 --> 00:57:22,517
and make me gasp oxygen

731
00:57:22,847 --> 00:57:24,405
from pain and surprise?

732
00:57:24,927 --> 00:57:26,201
Where would I be?

733
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:30,520
Where would I be
if they didn't pull me

734
00:57:31,127 --> 00:57:33,880
from my mother's sliced womb?
Where would I be?

735
00:57:35,087 --> 00:57:39,285
Where would I be if my mother
didn't sleep with my father

736
00:57:40,087 --> 00:57:43,523
on the hospital bed
where he lay with pneumonia

737
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:46,283
and she worked as a nurse.
Where would I be?

738
00:57:47,567 --> 00:57:49,398
Where I would be

739
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:51,638
if my mom didn't work as a nurse
and my father

740
00:57:51,967 --> 00:57:54,276
didn't wear a scarf in the spring.

741
00:57:54,527 --> 00:57:55,801
Where would I be?

742
00:57:56,127 --> 00:57:58,516
How strange if mother
and father didn't exist.

743
00:57:58,927 --> 00:58:00,280
Where would I be?

744
00:58:00,687 --> 00:58:01,961
How strange...

745
00:58:02,287 --> 00:58:04,084
Where would I be
if I did not exist?

746
00:58:06,047 --> 00:58:08,083
Very strange...

747
00:58:08,927 --> 00:58:11,043
I don't know. I really don't know.

748
00:58:11,567 --> 00:58:14,286
But without my mother and father

749
00:58:15,007 --> 00:58:18,283
I would have been
in prison by thirty.

750
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,406
That's right,

751
00:58:21,367 --> 00:58:23,756
I am sure of that!

752
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:29,241
It's very strange.

753
00:58:29,567 --> 00:58:32,286
If I weren't here,
where would I be?

754
00:58:32,607 --> 00:58:35,280
What would it be like?
That better place?

755
00:58:36,367 --> 00:58:39,279
Maybe with those
who were not here before?

756
00:58:39,967 --> 00:58:42,276
Maybe among those
who aren't here yet?

757
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:45,043
Those who haven't breathed
oxygen yet,

758
00:58:45,367 --> 00:58:49,201
who have not hated their parents,
never had an abortion,

759
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:52,280
never went on strike,
or blasphemed?

760
00:58:53,087 --> 00:58:54,839
Maybe I would've been happy there,

761
00:58:56,447 --> 00:58:58,677
in a place without oxygen famine,

762
00:58:59,487 --> 00:59:02,957
where water is not sold
in plastic bottles?

763
00:59:05,287 --> 00:59:08,279
Where no aerosol cloud
hangs over the sky.

764
00:59:09,127 --> 00:59:10,845
Where ice does not melt on end

765
00:59:11,167 --> 00:59:13,681
and turf bogs do not burn

766
00:59:14,007 --> 00:59:16,237
and choke our lungs,

767
00:59:17,007 --> 00:59:19,475
lungs created by God

768
00:59:20,127 --> 00:59:21,446
to take in oxygen.

769
00:59:24,567 --> 00:59:27,923
It has been said: 'By their fruits
shall ye know the trees. '

770
00:59:28,447 --> 00:59:31,086
Then what can I say
about the tree called 'God? '

771
00:59:31,407 --> 00:59:34,797
If it were written, 'A corrupt tree
bringeth forth evil fruit' -

772
00:59:35,127 --> 00:59:37,687
- what does this mean?
- I am a fruit of this tree,

773
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:40,726
and by me people shall know
if the tree is corrupt.

774
00:59:41,047 --> 00:59:44,084
This fruit shall be judged
by the tree.

775
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:49,922
Look at me;
I am the fruit of a heavenly tree.

776
00:59:50,967 --> 00:59:53,276
A heavenly tree
brings forth heavenly fruit.

777
00:59:53,607 --> 00:59:56,565
Yesterday I was
at a party with a girl

778
00:59:56,887 --> 00:59:58,525
and you know what I did to her?

779
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:01,122
The tree called 'God' is heavenly.

780
01:00:01,447 --> 01:00:04,086
I am the fruit. People
shall know the tree by me.

781
01:00:04,407 --> 01:00:06,284
A corrupt tree
bringeth forth evil fruit.

782
01:00:06,607 --> 01:00:10,282
The fruit it will bring
shall be heavenly too.

783
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:13,275
Fruit such as I
comes from a tree such as I

784
01:00:13,607 --> 01:00:15,279
'Ye shall know
them by their fruits. '

785
01:00:15,607 --> 01:00:17,757
Fruit contains 'oxygen':

786
01:00:18,127 --> 01:00:21,676
Not the O2
that fills the tanks of sea divers

787
01:00:22,207 --> 01:00:25,279
but the oxygen
we have talked about here.

788
01:00:25,687 --> 01:00:29,282
My God is terrible
if I am the fruit of the tree

789
01:00:29,687 --> 01:00:32,247
and people will know it by me.

790
01:00:32,567 --> 01:00:35,684
Oxygen, without which
angels and saints

791
01:00:36,247 --> 01:00:38,761
never take a step.

792
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:42,682
That is why I say to Him:
'For the love of God,

793
01:00:43,007 --> 01:00:44,884
forgive me
and don't take my breath.

794
01:00:45,207 --> 01:00:47,641
I have asthma,
but to hell with that! '

795
01:00:47,967 --> 01:00:51,357
All of creation
breathes oxygen...

796
01:00:52,447 --> 01:00:55,678
I only ask
that the oxygen flow not be cut.

797
01:00:57,207 --> 01:01:00,244
Earth's intricate,
controversial life

798
01:01:00,687 --> 01:01:02,279
was created for oxygen.

799
01:01:02,607 --> 01:01:05,997
It would be good to breath oxygen
after death

800
01:01:06,527 --> 01:01:10,679
and not the stale shit
you inhale at the visa office.

801
01:01:11,087 --> 01:01:13,237
'Ye shall know
them by their fruits. '

802
01:02:48,647 --> 01:02:51,684
