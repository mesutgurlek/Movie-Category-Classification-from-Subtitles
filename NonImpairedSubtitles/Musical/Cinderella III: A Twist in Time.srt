I danced with the Prince.
That was my slipper.

00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,871
[screams]

486
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,032
I'm sorry.

487
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:41,906
Oh, dear. [whimpers]

488
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,779
Um... Are you OK?

489
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:53,922
Oh! Oh, sorry, these aren't my shoes.

490
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:57,359
I mean, what am I saying?
Of course they're my shoes.

491
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:00,886
Oh, I just don't know
what's wrong with me today.

492
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,126
Oh, no, no, it was my fault.

493
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:06,500
I'm afraid I'm just not up-to-date
on the latest dance steps.

494
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:10,667
[clears throat]
Sire, if I may, um, your fitting.

495
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:15,145
Oh. Oh, yes.
This was fun. Thank you.

496
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,875
Well, if you'll please excuse me.

497
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,882
[chuckles] Um, come along, sire.

498
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:25,252
And after the fitting,
we must approve the butter sculpture.

499
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,416
I think it's a stunning likeness.

500
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,154
# <i>La-la-la-la-la-la...</i>

501
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,992
Well, no grace, no poise.

502
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,794
Other than that, it was lovely.

503
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:38,597
He was nice to me.

504
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,605
[snickering] That's because
he's under a spell.

505
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,836
He'd have to be, to fall for you.

506
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:47,941
It's more than that.

507
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,377
[King] Ladies!

508
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,774
[Stepmother] Your Majesty!

509
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:58,812
[King] I need to speak with my future
daughter-in-law immediately.

510
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,620
Alone!

511
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,360
Let's make a run for it while we can.

512
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:15,839
No, sire, sire, I'll have a dozen
dance instructors sent in immediately.

513
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,238
Something's wrong.

514
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:19,606
[gasping] An army of dance instructors.

515
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:20,939
No, no.

516
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:24,641
I thought... Why, I was sure
it was Anastasia last night.

517
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,877
But...

518
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,511
...well, just now when
I touched her hand...

519
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,550
...I felt...

520
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,392
...nothing.

521
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,861
Oh, I can explain everything,
Your Majesty.

522
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,364
I have this,
this inner ear thing and, and...

523
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:45,129
You, my dear, are a dreadful dancer.

524
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:48,834
Yes, I know, Your Majesty.

525
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,068
Reminds me of my queen.

526
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:53,702
She trod on my feet too.

527
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:58,738
But she took very good care of my heart.

528
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,915
[chuckling] Come here, my dear.

529
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,649
I want to show you something.

530
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:11,393
A princess is bestowed with many riches.

531
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,894
Land, jewels, horses.

532
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:21,601
But today I wish to give you
something much more valuable.

533
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,232
Oh.

534
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,972
Isn't it lovely?

535
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,676
A seashell?

536
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:35,208
This shell was the queen's
most treasured possession.

537
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:39,985
We found it while
walking by the water the day we met.

538
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,822
You see, we reached
for it at the same moment,

539
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:46,421
and when our hands touched... [chuckles]

540
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:50,297
...that's when I knew
I had found true love.

541
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,800
You knew that just by touching her hand?

542
00:32:54,872 --> 00:33:00,811
There's no more powerful
force in the world than true love.

543
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:10,080
[clears throat]
Well, that's all. Run along, now.

544
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,646
- Run along.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

545
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,422
I do.

546
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,984
Oh, I do.

547
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,927
I do. I do.

548
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,196
I really do.

549
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,066
[giggles]

550
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,663
[gasps] Oh!

551
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,772
[giggles]

552
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,004
Oh, I do.

553
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:42,279
# <i>Now there is finally</i>
<i>someone to love me</i>

554
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:46,847
# <i>He'll show me a world</i>
<i>that I never knew</i>

555
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:52,055
# <i>With two simple words,</i>
<i>all my dreams will come true</i>

556
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,961
# <i>I do</i>

557
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:58,799
# <i>I do</i> #

558
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,282
[chirping]

559
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,548
You go get the Prince.

560
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,783
[Drizella cackling] Bigger!

561
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,825
Ooh, let's try this!

562
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:24,856
Oh, that's gorgeous.

563
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,500
[laughs]

564
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,057
Lovely.

565
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:34,161
Drizella, stop that this instant!

566
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,671
[groans]

567
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,436
This wand is not a toy.

568
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,444
It's in the dresser.
Key's in her pocket.

569
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,573
[grunts]

570
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,015
I've got to get in there.

571
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,712
Cinderelly! They'll see you!

572
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,515
- Yeah, too dangerous.
- But I...

573
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,112
We'll take care of it!

574
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,555
[Anastasia] I do.

575
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,990
I do.

576
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,391
I do.

577
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,896
I do. Oh, I do.

578
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:13,571
Alright, but whatever you do,
stay clear of Lucifer.

579
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:16,010
Zug-zug. No Lucifee.

580
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,744
What happened?
What'd the King say?

581
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:20,078
[groans]

582
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,210
He's really very nice.

583
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:25,050
He gave me his most prized possession.

584
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,591
[scoffs] A seashell?

585
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:29,387
It's a symbol of true love.

586
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,620
[yelps]

587
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,061
Oh, please.

588
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:38,159
- [scoffs] How special.
- [Anastasia] He said that his heart...

589
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,865
[Stepmother] What's love compared
to the power we hold with the wand?

590
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:44,066
You will learn that soon enough.

591
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,473
[snoring]

592
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,773
[Anastasia]
I want the Prince to love me.

593
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,813
I think he could.

594
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:53,146
[Drizella cackling] Oh, you're serious.

595
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,742
[Anastasia] Well, the King likes me too.

596
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,620
He treated me like his own daughter.
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this.

597
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:02,957
[Drizella] Maybe I should
have put on the slipper.

598
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,016
[sniffing]

599
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,529
[Anastasia] Maybe we don't
even need the wand.

600
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:08,189
[meows]

601
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,327
[yelps]

602
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,395
Oh!

603
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:18,033
[Drizella] Oh! Somebody put out the cat!

604
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:24,273
[Anastasia] Lucifer!
Oh, hold still! Stop!

605
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,224
- Lucifer!
- [meows]

606
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,696
[Stepmother sighs]
Someone fetch the housekeeper.

607
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:44,000
[knocking]

608
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:45,865
[Cinderella] Housekeeping.

609
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,039
Well, you certainly came quickly.

610
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:54,907
[clears throat] We're very good.

611
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:03,848
Clean this up. My daughter needs her
beauty sleep before tonight's wedding.

612
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,515
[scoffs] Think that'll be enough time?

613
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,065
Keep out of the maid's way, girls.

614
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:28,077
There's a lot to do before the wedding.

615
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,846
Hmm?

616
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,212
[straining]

617
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,679
Isn't that right, Cinderella?

618
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:41,587
[gasps] I didn't know you worked here.

619
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:46,060
You're far more persistent
than I thought.

620
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,030
I won't let you get away with this.

621
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,091
- We already have.
- I don't think so.

622
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:52,760
Jaq! Gus!

623
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,769
[both shout]

624
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,807
- The wand!

[snarling]

626
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,102
[Gus] Us coming, Cinderelly!

00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,105

[Jaq] Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

629
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,454
That servant girl is a thief! Get her!

630
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:13,921
Zug-zug.

631
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,588
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

[guard] Stop! Thief!

634
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,670
- Seize her at once!
- Don't move! Hold it!

635
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:35,234
Halt in the name of the King!

636
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,247
[both] Whoa!

637
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,022
You incompetent fools!

638
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,022

Oh, don't trouble yourself,
Your Highness.

I'll see to it, personally,

Personally, Your Highness.

687
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,851
Put her on the next ship
leaving the kingdom.

688
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:31,285
I want her banished forever.

No. No, I mean something's wrong.

Oh, nonsense, my boy. You wanted
the girl who fit the glass slipper.

Hello? Uh... little mice?

Well, it's official. I've lost my mind.

711

Cinderella.

[priest groans]

974

Spoiled little ingrate.

01:01:13,935 --> 01:01:17,029
I've given you everything
you ever wanted, Anastasia!

976
01:01:17,105 --> 01:01:19,767
But I want someone to love me, for me.

Guards! Guards! Seize that woman!

983
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:49,330
- And now for you!
- Turn her into a toad, Mother.

984
01:01:49,404 --> 01:01:51,668
Stop! No more!

No!

This is the real Cinderella,
your true love.

991

994
01:02:54,402 --> 01:02:57,371
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

995
01:03:04,212 --> 01:03:07,045
I can't take much more of this.

996
01:03:09,818 --> 01:03:11,149
Anastasia.

997
01:03:18,393 --> 01:03:20,156
Thank you.

Boo.

1000

Oh, goodness! I certainly am stiff.

1001
01:03:36,444 --> 01:03:38,002
Your Majesty...

1002
01:03:38,747 --> 01:03:40,681
...I don't deserve this.

1003
01:03:46,254 --> 01:03:49,917
Everyone deserves true love.

1004
01:03:54,696 --> 01:03:56,391
Oh!

1005
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:01,591

Thank you.

1008

Would you like me
to return you to your former lives?

1009
01:04:14,649 --> 01:04:15,980
Former lives?

1010

Why, yes. You see, you two...

1011
01:04:18,887 --> 01:04:21,219
Well, you were already...

1012

Oh, never mind.

1013
01:04:24,025 --> 01:04:27,324
Well?
Does anyone want to marry my son?

1014
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:32,460
I do.

1015
01:04:32,534 --> 01:04:34,001
[gasps]

1016
01:04:34,069 --> 01:04:37,038
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
