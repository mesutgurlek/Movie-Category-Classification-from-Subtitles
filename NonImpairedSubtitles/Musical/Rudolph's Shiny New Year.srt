1
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,345
<i>"You know Rudolph,
who guided and pulled Santa's sleigh</i>

2
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,916
<i>"And who saved Christmas
by lighting the way</i>

3
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,344
<i>"But there's more to tell</i>

4
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:25,648
<i>"Rudolph saved the New Year as well"</i>

5
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:32,121
<i>And it all began
on that very same foggy night.</i>

6
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,398
<i>Santa received a strange message.</i>

7
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,303
What's this?

8
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,698
Why, it's from Father Time.

9
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:42,931
My old friend.

10
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,103
"Dear Santa, I am in terrible trouble!

11
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,542
"You must help me!

12
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,311
"The old year ends in a week.

13
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:56,584
"But this time there may not be
another year to follow!

14
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:01,385
"Happy, the Baby New Year, is...

15
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:02,860
"...missing!"

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,760
Why, that's terrible!
If the Baby New Year isn't found...

17
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,330
...the old year will just keep going on...

18
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:14,238
...and on, and it will be
December 31 forever!

19
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:18,678
I'll send out a search party at once!
But wait!

20
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:23,342
Nobody could find their way anywhere
in all this dark fog and snow!

21
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,915
Nobody, that is, except...

22
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,385
...Rudolph!

23
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:34,921
Once more, the happiness
of all the world's children depends on you!

24
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,961
You must find the Baby New Year!

25
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,966
And you've less than a week
in which to do it!

26
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,562
You mean...

27
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:45,531
Rudolph, with your nose so bright...

28
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:49,465
...you've six days left to set things right!

29
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,380
I'll do my best, Santa!

30
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,816
<i>Yes, Happy, the Baby New Year
was missing.</i>

31
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:50,623
<i>And Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
was on his way to see me...</i>

32
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:54,365
<i>...before starting on his journey
to find the Baby New Year.</i>

33
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,439
<i>"How do I know?" you ask. "Who am I?"</i>

34
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,703
I'm Father Time.

35
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:10,149
"What do I do?" you ask.
I do what all fathers do.

36
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,213
I take care of things.

37
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,216
The time, mostly.

38
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,583
All the time in the universe.

39
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,751
I keep everything in tip-top,
tick-tock shape.

40
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,394
Slowpoke.

41
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:28,066
But most of all,
I make certain that every January 1...

42
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,127
...we have a bright and happy New Year!

43
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,707
That's why I was so upset
to find little Happy missing.

44
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,368
But Rudolph...

45
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,843
...well, he just...

46
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:42,041
Hold on. I'm getting ahead of myself.

47
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,814
Running a little fast, as it were.

48
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,180
Back please, back.

49
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:51,223
To the night Rudolph set out alone...

50
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,056
...and was soon joined by General Ticker...

51
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:58,695
<i>...one of my most trustworthy officers.
A real clockwork soldier.</i>

52
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:05,667
Come on, General Ticker. You can make it.

53
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,207
Father Time's castle can't be too far ahead.

54
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,008
You're bold, sir!

55
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,238
I'm cold, sir!

56
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,206
This dashed snow!

57
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,743
I'm pretty cold, too.

58
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,577
Don't weaken!

59
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,710
Your beacon...

60
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,379
...must cast its glow!

61
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,216
Don't worry! I won't weaken!

62
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:40,206
<i>And finally, with great effort,
they reached the edge of a great desert:</i>

63
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,197
<i>The Sands of Time!</i>

64
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,846
A desert! What do we do now?

65
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,681
We cross, sir.

66
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,512
The boss, sir, is still quite far.

67
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,846
Father Time's castle is
on the other side of the desert?

68
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,125
Oh, quite, sir! 'Tis right, sir...

69
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,887
...beneath that star!

70
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,998
That's still a long way to go!

71
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,430
<i>Perhaps I might be of some assistance?</i>

72
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,498
Who are you?

73
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:15,904
<i>A friend.</i>

74
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:22,006
How do you do?
I am the Great Quarter-Past-Five.

75
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:26,085
Father Time sent me to help you
in your journey.

76
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,382
The Great Quarter-Past-Five?

77
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,684
May I call you Quart for short?

78
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,990
I'd rather you didn't,
if it's all the same to you.

79
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,963
Hop on, please.

80
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:48,900
<i>They were halfway
across the Sands of Time when suddenly...</i>

81
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:56,582
What is it?

82
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,711
I'm seein' old Aeon!

83
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,647
We've got to flee!

84
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,553
Run! Run! Run!

85
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,054
All fear Aeon the Terrible!

86
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,594
<i>It was the horrible monster-bird...</i>

87
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,866
<i>...who had terrorized the Sands of Time
for countless ages:</i>

88
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:20,967
<i>Aeon the Terrible!</i>

89
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,943
There's better pickings!

90
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,582
It's not us he's looking for.

91
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,390
Who does he want?

92
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,256
I do fear the New Year!

93
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:45,926
Do you agree?

94
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,637
I certainly do.
He's out looking for Happy, too!

95
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:54,602
You see, Aeon can only live...

96
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:58,072
...until he is one aeon old.

97
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:02,411
Then he will turn into ice and snow.

98
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,375
How long is an aeon?

99
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,848
Immeasurably long.

100
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:14,258
But his aeon is finally up this December 31.

101
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,461
He has only six days left.

102
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,729
That's why he wants to capture
the Baby New Year!

103
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,661
To stop time!

104
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:29,336
If December 31 goes on forever,
so will he!

105
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,969
He'll never change to snow!

106
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,344
He'll never stop scaring people!

107
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:41,318
Not if we find Happy first!
Come on, Great Quarter-Past-Five!

108
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,218
Get us to Father Time's castle, quick!

109
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:49,620
Well, since we're being quick
about things...

110
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,990
...you may call me Quart!

111
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,392
Let's go, Quart!

112
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,564
<i>In no time they arrived at my castle.</i>

113
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,444
<i>The Palace of Happy New Years!</i>

114
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,974
<i>"Have a happy, have a happy</i>

115
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,775
<i>"Have a happy New Year</i>

116
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,846
<i>"As the bell rings out
Everyone one will shout</i>

117
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,980
<i>"Happy New Year</i>

118
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,753
<i>"Have a happy, have a happy</i>

119
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,724
<i>"May each day be filled with good cheer</i>

120
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,956
<i>"And with nothing less
Than much happiness</i>

121
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,895
<i>"All through the year"</i>

122
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,162
Why, it's true.

123
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,572
That nose of yours
is as red as my hair used to be.

124
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,511
They used to call me Old Red Head.

125
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,077
It's a pleasure to serve you, sir.

126
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,578
Rudolph, do you know what really happens
every New Year's Eve?

127
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:49,316
Do you know how we make the change
from one year to the next?

128
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,647
No, sir.

129
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:55,024
All I know is that everyone says,
"Happy New Year."

130
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,054
It is a happy occasion,
and a solemn one, too.

131
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,569
For the passing of time is awe-inspiring.

132
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:06,464
It's the one certain thing
in all the universe.

133
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,439
<i>In a way it is like an old king
stepping down...</i>

134
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,509
<i>...and a new one taking his place.</i>

135
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,883
<i>A Baby New Year starts out
every January 1...</i>

136
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,115
<i>“innocent and young as springtime.</i>

00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,070
<i>And as midnight nears,
the old year waits...</i>

154
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:53,974
<i>...as all the clocks count down
his last moments.</i>

155
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,082
<i>Midnight!</i>

156
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,479
<i>And the magic diamond...</i>

157
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:04,613
<i>...is lowered to signify the end...</i>

158
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,750
<i>...and the beginning!</i>

<i>"Have a happy, happy New Year"</i>

160
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:19,499
This year, the diamond
may not come down.

161
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,904
But what happened to the Baby New Year?

162
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:23,972
He ran away.

163
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:27,909
You see, little Happy was
anything but happy here.

164
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,275
And I didn't know a thing about it.

165
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,686
<i>Happy was different
from all the other little New Years.</i>

166
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,315
<i>You see, he had... rather unusual...</i>

167
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,155
<i>...big ears.</i>

168
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:48,328
Gaw-blimey! I can't help it!
Those bloomin' ears.

169
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:56,173
Oh, do forgive me, but...

170
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,653
<i>No one meant to be cruel...</i>

171
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,520
<i>...but that night,
poor little Happy ran away...</i>

172
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:15,353
<i>...and we haven't seen
hide nor hair of him since!</i>

173
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:20,895
I wish he would have come to me.

174
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,563
I know just how he felt.

175
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,802
I bet they called him names...

176
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:29,843
...and wouldn't let him join
in any New Year games.

177
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,741
Do you have any idea where he went?

178
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:38,607
His nurse, Nanny Nine-O'clock,
said that he always wanted to see...

179
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:41,312
...the Archipelago of Last Years.

180
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:45,346
"Archipelago"?
What does that word mean, sir?

181
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,518
It's a group of islands.

182
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:52,659
The Archipelago of Last Years is
the most fantastic archipelago of all.

183
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:58,203
Far north, in the most northern
of all the northern seas...

184
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,908
<i>...hidden from the rest of the world
by an everlasting icy fog.</i>

185
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:06,103
<i>Each island is an old year.</i>

186
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,147
<i>I don't understand, sir.</i>

187
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:13,484
<i>You see, when the old year's time is done,
he retires to the Archipelago...</i>

188
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,512
<i>...and selects an island.</i>

189
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:20,118
<i>And the island becomes his alone.
Time stands still...</i>

190
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:24,854
<i>...and remains just the same
as it was during the year he reigned.</i>

191
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,167
<i>The Archipelago of Last Years.</i>

192
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,300
Happy may be hiding
on one of those islands...

193
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,236
...on one of those long-ago years.

194
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,969
I'll search every island if I have to.
Where do I find them?

195
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,738
<i>Go to where the Sands of Time meet
the Sea of Auld Lang Syne.</i>

196
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,751
<i>There you will find a giant sundial.</i>

197
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:50,518
A sundial in all this fog?

198
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:55,221
<i>The arm points through the icy fog
to the Archipelago of Last Years.</i>

199
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,622
<i>Point your gleaming nose in that direction.</i>

200
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,160
<i>Rudolph, do not veer from your course...</i>

201
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:07,232
<i>...and you will find yourself
going back, back, into time.</i>

202
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,917
<i>"Turn back the years</i>

203
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,383
<i>"Live the simple life once again</i>

204
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,019
<i>"Live the days of 'remember when'</i>

205
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:28,753
<i>"Turn back the years</i>

206
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,757
<i>"Turn back the years</i>

207
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,666
<i>"Walk along any sunny lane</i>

208
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,133
<i>"Walking's better than any plane</i>

209
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,437
<i>"Turn back the years</i>

210
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:48,010
<i>"Just remember the good times
that you knew</i>

211
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:55,150
<i>"Don't remember the bad times
you've been through</i>

212
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:59,325
<i>"Life disappears</i>

213
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,994
<i>"Sooner than you would think it would</i>

214
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:04,527
<i>"Fool yourself, everybody should</i>

215
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:09,633
<i>"Turn back the years</i>

216
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:15,975
<i>"Turn back the years"</i>

217
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:34,758
Oh, no! It's Aeon!

218
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,085
<i>Aeon the Terrible!</i>

219
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,928
<i>He was determined
that Rudolph would not find Happy.</i>

220
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,429
<i>He intended to do everything
in his power...</i>

221
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,234
<i>...to stop the little red-nosed reindeer!</i>

222
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,208
It looked pretty bad for Rudolph.

223
00:16:56,582 --> 00:17:00,678
He was on his way through the icy fog
to the Archipelago of Last Years...

224
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,347
...searching for Happy,
the Baby New Year...

225
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:07,020
<i>...when Aeon the Terrible swooped down
out of the sky.</i>

226
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,794
Got to go faster!

227
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,636
<i>Aeon was just about to swoop down,
when...</i>

228
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,578
Oh, my gosh!

229
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:33,584
Now, Rudy, don't you fret any
about that overgrown chicken.

230
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,820
Who are you?

231
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,787
Folks call me Big Ben.

232
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,220
Look what can I do.

233
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,490
Climb inside. It's safe in there.

234
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,097
What did you say?

235
00:17:57,343 --> 00:18:01,507
I asked if you were comfortable.
Kind of hard to talk with your mouth full.

236
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:07,112
Oh sure, Big Ben.
But maybe I'd better ride on top.

237
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,444
Okay, suit yourself!

238
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,660
I won't let you find Happy...

239
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,365
...before I do!

240
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,370
You are a bad birdie.

241
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:42,116
<i>Yes, even Aeon the Terrible
was no match for Big Ben!</i>

242
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:51,187
<i>By the next morning,
Big Ben had taken Rudolph...</i>

243
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,824
<i>...to just about the oldest island
in the whole Archipelago of Last Years.</i>

244
00:18:56,535 --> 00:19:00,597
<i>It was the island where
old One Million BC had gone to retire.</i>

245
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,772
<i>While Big Ben waited for him
in the harbor...</i>

246
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:08,537
<i>...the little reindeer went ashore
to find old One Million himself.</i>

247
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,316
Anybody home?

248
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:17,250
But certainly! Always there's anybody!
No? Yes?

249
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,053
Hi! You must be...

250
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,618
Who? Me? O.M.!

251
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,119
O.M.?

252
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:25,894
Short for One Million.

253
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:30,027
Too much work, all the time saying
"One Million." Yes? No? Yes!

254
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:34,567
I suppose so.

255
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,339
Why for the edges on your mouth go down,
not up?

256
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,106
I'm looking for Happy, the Baby New Year.

257
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:45,383
What if I don't find him in time?

258
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:49,745
Don't? Stop with the "don't" thoughts!
Start with the "do" thoughts!

259
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:56,022
"When things go wrong
and dark clouds fill your sky

260
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:59,194

Sounds wonderful, O.M.

278
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:15,035
I'll take your advice,
and I know I'll find Happy!

279
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:16,502
Who's happy?

280
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:19,201
Everybody's happy!

281
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,715
O.M., please!

282
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,347
Happy is the new Baby New Year!

283
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:31,389
He's missing! I thought
he might have come here.

284
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:35,686
A little baby? Oh, yeah. Yeah! Yeah!

285
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:37,628
He's here?

286
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:38,696
No.

287
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,323
But he was!

288
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,426
<i>O.M. told Rudolph that little Happy
did visit the island.</i>

289
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,240
<i>He made lots of friends, too. Why, once...</i>

290
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,704
<i>...he saved a baby Pterodactyl's life.</i>

291
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,550
<i>But unfortunately...</i>

292
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:11,454
<i>Heartbroken...</i>

293
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,531
<i>...and misunderstanding the laughter
of his new friends...</i>

294
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,195
<i>...little Happy made himself a boat
out of a giant conch shell...</i>

295
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,732
<i>...and sailed off, running away once more.</i>

296
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,137
And that is the last time I have
ever seen him.

297
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,046
But look, let's both look!

298
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:33,649
He has positively got to be
on one of these islands, maybe.

299
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,386
Yes?

300
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:36,513
Okay, come on!

301
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,321
Big Ben is waiting!

302
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:43,684
<i>At first, they had no luck at all.
For two days they searched...</i>

303
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:46,094
1893 never heard of him!

304
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:51,493
1492 was too busy discovering things
to even talk to us.

305
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:55,430
1965 was too noisy.

306
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:59,839
And all 4000 BC could think about
was building pyramids!

307
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:03,245
Lots more islands! Lots more! Lots more!

308
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:07,217
But it's only three days until December 31.

309
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:08,887
Time's running short.

310
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,120
Maybe that island up there
will know something.

311
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,659
Certainly looks impressive!

312
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:17,495
<i>It was the island belonging to old 1023.</i>

313
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,625
<i>Just about the most fantastic island
in the whole Archipelago!</i>

314
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:26,536
<i>Full of castles and princesses
and knights in shining armor.</i>

315
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:30,570
<i>And as soon as they landed
they met the proprietor of the island...</i>

316
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,470
<i>...old Sir 1023 himself.</i>

317
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,614
Thou look'st for the wee babe, Happy?

318
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,279
Is he here, Sir 1023?

319
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:40,443
Aye?

320
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:41,719
Where?

321
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:44,923
I've not the slightest notion in me noggin!

322
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:48,493
But come'st thou with me!
Come'st. We searcheth!

323
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:52,597
"Come'st thou with me! We searcheth!"
Clank! Clank! Clank!

324
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:58,194
<i>And so they began to search the island,
asking everybody about Happy...</i>

325
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:00,734
...and all the people they met.

326
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,705
You see 1023 was the year when
all those fairy tales we know...

327
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,209
...actually took place!

328
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,874
"What a wonderful world we live in

329
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:17,255
<i>"When we live in the world of make believe</i>

330
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:21,683
<i>"Fairy tales can come true</i>

331
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,454
<i>"If you just wish them to</i>

332
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:30,067
<i>"And there's nothing you can't achieve</i>

333
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:38,544
<i>"What a wonderful world we live in</i>

334
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:43,371
<i>"Just recall Cinderella and her shoe</i>

335
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:46,246
<i>"You can live like a king</i>

336
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,685
<i>"You can be anything</i>

337
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:53,423
<i>"As long as you believe it's true</i>

338
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:58,028
<i>"And what a wonderful world...</i>

339
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:01,223
<i>"...if you do"</i>

340
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,268
No, I'm sorry. I haven't seen Happy.

341
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,467
Have you, my dear?

342
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:17,609
I saw him! Made me laugh so hard
I fell off the wall!

343
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,509
- But where is he?
- Dunno.

344
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:25,515
When all the king's horses
and all the king's men started to laugh...

345
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,188
...he ran off.

346
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,396
<i>Nope! Ain't seen him!</i>

347
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,799
<i>- Not hide nor hair!
- No baby around</i> here!

348
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:39,235
<i>Sorry!</i>

349
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:40,794
<i>Better look someplace else!</i>

350
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:43,168
All seven say no!

351
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,605
<i>Aye! I saw him!</i>

352
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,113
But he ran away from me!

353
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:52,784
No baby ever wants to stay with me!

354
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:02,060
So neareth and yet so fareth!

355
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:07,454
<i>Little did they know, but Baby Happy
was nearer than anyone suspected.</i>

356
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:14,064
<i>Happy looked clown and saw just about
the friendliest little house that ever was.</i>

357
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:19,572
<i>Nobody was home inside,
but everything was as neat as a pin.</i>

358
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:24,146
<i>He was very hungry.
And there on the table he spied...</i>

359
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,548
<i>...three bowls of porridge.</i>

360
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:29,454
<i>The first was too hot!</i>

361
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,146
<i>The second too cold!</i>

362
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,689
<i>The third was just right!</i>

363
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,654
<i>So he decided to sit down
and enjoy breakfast.</i>

364
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,728
<i>But the first chair was too hard.</i>

365
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,934
<i>The second too soft.</i>

366
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,504
<i>But the third was just right.</i>

367
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:55,679
<i>He broke it! Whoever owns this house
is not going to like that!</i>

368
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:59,648
<i>But Happy was too tired
to care about anything...</i>

369
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:04,356
<i>...and so he went upstairs,
where he was sure there were some beds.</i>

370
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:09,618
<i>But meanwhile, the owners of the cottage
were coming home!</i>

371
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:23,164
Yes, little Happy, the New Year,
had gone to sleep...

372
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:26,109
...in the cottage of a family of bears.
Three bears.

373
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:30,771
There <i>was the Papa Bear,
the Momma Bear, and the Baby Bear.</i>

374
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,681
Someone's been sitting in my chair!

375
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:37,084
Someone's been sitting in my chair!

376
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:40,619
Someone's been sitting in my chair.
And it got broke!

377
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:42,691
Somebody broke my chair!

378
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,296
Someone's been tasting my porridge!

379
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:49,864
Someone's been tasting my porridge!

380
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,697
Someone ate mine all up!

381
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:56,636
Someone's been sleeping in our beds!

382
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,203
In mine too!

383
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,203
And there he is!

384
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,680
Well, what do you know?

385
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,146
He's sweet.

386
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:10,622
He'd make a nice friend!

387
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,815
You want to be my little friend?

388
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:19,288
We could play make up games! All kinds.

389
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,662
Knights and Dragons.
You can be the knight!

390
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,100
And Crusaders! That's a great game!

391
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:25,598
Okay, friend?

392
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:31,602
<i>Happy had found a true friend at last.</i>

393
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:35,207
<i>I guess that's the most important thing
in the world, isn't it?</i>

394
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:37,241
<i>Making friends, I mean.</i>

395
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,514
Another mouth to feed?

396
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:43,180
Junior needs a friend.

397
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:47,788
Well, I don't imagine he eats much.

398
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,525
At least he likes porridge!

399
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:54,093
Now, I must be the dragon.

400
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:57,765
Now, you slay me.

401
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,328
Go ahead. Hit me, not too hard,
but you hit me.

402
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:05,241
Go ahead, it's only a game, you know.

403
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:12,307
Oh, you got me! I'm all slayed!

404
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,715
Now you must doff your helmet
in triumph!

405
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:19,150
You know, take off your hat.

406
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:24,492
But you've got to!
That's the way the game goes!

407
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,860
Goodness, you got to play the game right.

408
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:29,123
Fine friend you are!

409
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:35,236
<i>Well, Happy didn't want to lose his friend.
And he realized that...</i>

410
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,332
<i>...when you play a game,
you have to follow the rules.</i>

411
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:39,577
<i>So...</i>

412
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,445
Goodness, look at that!

413
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:50,954
Boy, I've never seen nothing
like that before!

414
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:58,596
<i>It was just like always.
Those bears didn't mean to be cruel...</i>

415
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:02,333
<i>...but they just couldn't stop laughing
at those ears.</i>

416
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:06,305
Hey! Where you going? Come back!

417
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,605
Come back! You're my friend!

418
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:10,768
It's dangerous in those woods all alone!

419
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:18,410
Happy! Where are you?

420
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:21,051
Come on, Happy, don't hide!

421
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,382
Happy!

422
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:24,189
Happy!

423
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,316
Happy, where are you?

424
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:32,387
Happy, don't hide!

425
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:34,597
We're here to help you!

426
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:37,828
He's got to be somewhere.

427
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,235
Look ye! Up yonder!

428
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,716
Aeon says not to worry!

429
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,211
I'll be your friend!

430
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,988
You'll like living with me!

431
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,355
Oh, no!

432
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:07,321
Come on!
We can't let them out of our sight!

433
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,563
I hope Big Ben can swim fast!

434
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:15,439
<i>Good old Big Ben. He could swim
almost as fast as Aeon could fly.</i>

435
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:16,607
<i>Almost.</i>

436
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:18,767
They're getting away from us!

437
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:22,169
Ben! Do something!

438
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,915
You bet your boots I will!

439
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:26,550
Watch out now! Watch your heads!

440
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,228
He fell off!

441
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,971
<i>But suddenly, a vagrant wind blew him
out of sight.</i>

442
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,707
He's lost again!

443
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,639
And we only have two days left!

444
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:04,950
<i>That old wind held the Baby New Year
aloft for more than a day.</i>

445
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,685
<i>But than, just as suddenly as it blew up...</i>

446
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,822
<i>...it blew away again.</i>

447
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,505
<i>And Happy came down
on still another island.</i>

448
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:25,837
<i>The one belonging to...</i>

449
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:30,878
Well, hello there, little fellow. I'm 1776!

450
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,307
But my friends call me Sev.

451
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,280
Would you be my friend?

452
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:41,052
Don't know who you are
or where you come from...

453
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:45,062
...but you're welcome to join
our big Fourth of July celebration.

454
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:51,395
I know you think it's December 30,
but not on this island.

455
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,669
No, sirree!

456
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:58,841
On this island,
every day is the Fourth of July.

457
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:09,544
Come on! You're just in time

Hey, little fella. Your hat!
Got to show respect for the flag.

477
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,346
The parade's over on that next block!

478
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:51,178
Gadzooks!
I'm certain it was Happy we saw.

479
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:55,189
Those ears!

480
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,422
Oh, no!

481
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:01,963
We're too late!

482
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,467
It happened again!

483
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,835
I feel terrible. We didn't mean to be cruel.

484
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:12,073
Those ears! Those ears!

But, you can count on me
to help you look for him.

Methinks that sounds like...

487
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:27,549
Methinks, too! Sounds like! Looks like!
Smells like! It is...

488
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:39,933
There, there. I'll take you home with me.

489
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:41,839
With me!

490
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,140
Aeon's tricked him again!

491
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:49,076
Poor little Happy thinks Aeon is
the only friend he has in the world!

492
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,211
We must pursue them!

493
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,808
Yes, we must after them
to the ends of the Earth!

494
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:59,851
Here, victory's ours!
For each dawn we die!

495
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:02,755
We must after them!

496
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:06,931
But how? It's night? We can't see a thing!

497
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:08,991
That's where I come in!

498
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:13,369
Come on, men!
We've got one day till New Years!

499
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:16,197
This is our last chance!

500
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:27,475
And so Aeon the Terrible flew off
with Happy, the Baby New Year...

501
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:31,886
...taking him back to his dismal home
on the Island of No Name.

502
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:33,886
<i>It was a terrible place...</i>

503
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,890
<i>...more like a haunted iceberg
than an island...</i>

504
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,861
<i>...far from the Archipelago of Last Years...</i>

505
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:44,396
<i>...due north of the North Po! E,
where the sun never shines.</i>

506
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:51,733
You'll never be found here,
and I will live forever.

507
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,520
<i>But Rudolph and his friends
hadn't ended the search.</i>

508
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,886
<i>No sir, not by a long shot.</i>

509
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,252
<i>Big Ben knew the way
to the Island of No Name...</i>

510
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:13,058
<i>...and Rudolph's red nose
lit up that foggy, rainy night...</i>

511
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:17,159
<i>...like a magic beacon
in an ocean of gloom and despair.</i>

512
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:21,938
We will rescue him in time? Yes? No?

513
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:23,599
No!

514
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,070
It looks bad for Happy.

515
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,438
'Tis...

516

Come on! Nothing is ever hopeless.

518

The Island of No Name.

539
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:02,739
Now, Rudy...

540
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:06,438
...so as old Aeon don't see us coming,
you'd better douse your nose!

But keep that hope burning bright inside!

542
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,774
Okay, Big Ben.

00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,022
What's that for?

544
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:22,387
Look at my clock.

546

New Years Eve.

547
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:31,098
Zounds, gadzooks, and odd bodkins.

548
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:32,694
We have but one half-hour!

549
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:34,728
We've got to be quick, then!

550

You!

554
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:11,643

caused an avalanche...</i>

555
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:14,474
<i>...which tumbled down onto Rudolph
and the others...</i>

556
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:17,081
<i>...turning them into helpless snowballs.</i>

They're all buried alive!

558

Your last hope is gone!

559
00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:28,088
And you'll live here with me as my slave!

560
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,127
And all time will stop!

561
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:36,461
And I will never turn into ice and snow!

562
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:40,964
Safe at last!

into a contented sleep...</i>

<i>And, indeed it did look as if
everything was over for Rudolph...</i>

567

<i>...and his friends. But, no!</i>

568
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,721
<i>Wait a moment. It's Rudolph!</i>

569
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,720
<i>He's trying to melt the snow with his nose!</i>

570
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:11,125
<i>Come on, Rudolph! You can do it!
Make that nose really glow!</i>

571
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:12,995
<i>Make it really shine!</i>

572
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,248
Now, to find Happy!

573
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:45,802
Hi.

574
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,438
My name is Rudolph.

575
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:52,637
Wait a minute. Don't be afraid.
I want to be your friend.

576
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,875
You think you can't have any friends?

577
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,044
Why not?

578
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:03,319
Come on. You can tell me.

579
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,950
Is it because of your ears?

580
00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:11,826
Heck, they couldn't be that bad.

581
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,499
Do you want to see something?

582
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:18,068
Look.

583
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:22,968
Go ahead. Laugh right out.

584
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,206
Doesn't bother me any more.

585
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:30,346
But when I was little,
it sure gave me one heck of a time.

586
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:33,412
You mean, you never heard about me?

587
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:37,580
Well, Rudolph was too modest
to tell his own story.

588
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:41,859
And so all the trees on the old mountain,
and the snowflakes...

589
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,191

631
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:42,005
Those ears!

632
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:44,802
Those ears!

633
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:52,847
<i>It was the first time that monstrosity
ever laughed in his life.</i>

634
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:56,748
<i>He laughed so hard that he laughed himself
right out of his nest.</i>

635
00:45:57,822 --> 00:46:00,553
<i>He laughed himself right down the side
of that mountain.</i>

636
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:04,084
<i>And then he laughed O.M., 1023 and Sev...</i>

637
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,328
<i>...free from their snowballs!</i>

638
00:46:06,831 --> 00:46:10,563
<i>To put it bluntly, he laughed himself silly!</i>

639
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:15,429
Old Aeon won't give us any trouble now.
He's cured for good.

640
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:21,879
Nobody can turn to snow and ice when
he's all warmed up inside with laughing.

641
00:46:24,749 --> 00:46:25,807
True!

642
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:30,311
That's true!

643
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,468
Midnight!

644
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:48,563
Even though we found Happy,
we're too late!

645
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:53,002
Don't give up hope! There must be
some way to get back...

646
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:56,444
...to Father Time's castle
before the twelfth bong!

647
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,679
There sure is, Rudolph!

648
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,650
It's Santa Claus!

649
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:10,283
If I can travel all over the world
in one night...

650
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:15,356
...I ought to be able to get you
to Father Time in a few bongs!

651
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:35,051
<i>They traveled faster than joy itself,
over the Sands of Time...</i>

652
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:37,448
<i>...right up to the gates of my castle!</i>

653
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,786
<i>And we lost no time getting Happy inside.</i>

654
00:47:42,126 --> 00:47:45,585
<i>We just made it! Without a bong to spare!</i>

655
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:51,364
<i>And outside...</i>

656
00:47:51,836 --> 00:47:52,997
<i>...the New Year...</i>

657
00:47:53,404 --> 00:47:55,839
<i>... "Nineteen Wonderful"  had arrived!</i>

658
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:06,742
<i>"Have a happy, have a happy</i>

659
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:09,850
<i>"Have a happy New Year</i>

660
00:48:09,954 --> 00:48:12,787

Everyone will shout

661
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:15,526

00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:18,424

664
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:24,198
"And with nothing less
Than much happiness

665
00:48:24,535 --> 00:48:27,004
"All through the year

666
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:30,072
"Should auld acquaintance be forgot

667
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:32,974
<i>"In the days of auld lang syne</i>

668
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,974
<i>"Then take a cup of kindness</i>

669
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:40,005
<i>"And you will always feel just fine</i>

670

00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:49,855
"Here's my wish for you
Hope my wish comes true

673
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,392
"Happy New Year

00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:54,131

"Happy New Year"

Happy New Year!

677
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:04,498
And may it be shiny, too!
