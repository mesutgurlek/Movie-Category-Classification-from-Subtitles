00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:12,485
It can't be done.
He's doing it.

305
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,373
You ought to see
some of those rehearsals.

306
00:19:16,295 --> 00:19:17,648
Don't go to pieces, Tony.

307
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:19,732
Broadway is full of eager
and talented people.

308
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,448
You created one Fay Lawrence,
you'll create another.

309
00:19:21,655 --> 00:19:22,644
Oh, sure.

310
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,728
Oh, I'd better go back
to my band, Tony.

311
00:19:25,935 --> 00:19:28,369
I must hold onto the boys
I still have.

312
00:19:28,575 --> 00:19:32,534
You know, most of them are already tooting
reveille in Green River, North Carolina.

313
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,327
Goodbye, Tony.

314
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:37,487
Stanton, that cheap,
double-crossing crook.

315
00:19:37,695 --> 00:19:39,208
Bringing out a new
Fay Lawrence.

316
00:19:39,415 --> 00:19:40,609
What does he know
about her anyway?

317
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:42,885
Mouse, have I ever
lied to you?

318
00:19:43,095 --> 00:19:45,086
Well, not unless
you had to, no.

319
00:19:45,295 --> 00:19:46,284
Then listen to me.

320
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:48,167
Fay Lawrence is part of me.
She's me.

321
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,367
Do you think I'm gonna let anybody
twist her around and ruin my life's work?

322
00:19:51,575 --> 00:19:52,928
Sounds like
he's doing it, boss.

323
00:19:53,135 --> 00:19:56,047
I don't believe it. I've gotta
see that with my own eyes.

324
00:19:56,255 --> 00:19:57,768
And I'm going to tomorrow.

325
00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:05,929
Well, boss, it was no lie.

326

They haven't opened yet.

327
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,364
Yeah, they gotta
rehearse first.

328
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,214

<i>And I'm overboard again</i>

335
00:21:27,455 --> 00:21:30,492
<i>Is it that song?</i>

336
00:21:30,695 --> 00:21:34,529
<i>Or is it love?</i>

337
00:21:34,735 --> 00:21:38,091
<i>I know that you're near to me</i>

338

339

How do you like
the number, Fay?

352
00:24:31,975 --> 00:24:33,886
I don't want to okay anything
unless you're enthusiastic about it.

353
00:24:34,135 --> 00:24:36,171
Oh, I always say yes
to a good number.

354
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:39,851
You know, Fay, I'm convinced that this show is going
to give you the greatest scope for your talents.

355
00:24:40,055 --> 00:24:41,488
I told you I'd surround you
with the best.

356
00:24:41,735 --> 00:24:45,808
Anyway, I'm so glad to be with someone
who can keep his word... I hope.

357
00:24:47,015 --> 00:24:49,165
That's appreciation for you.

358
00:24:49,775 --> 00:24:51,333
Pardon me, Miss Lawrence,
your number's on next.

359
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:54,408
Uh, did you decide to drive in on
the gaucho carriage for this number?

360
00:24:54,615 --> 00:24:57,573
No, dear, I'm coming in
on my own momentum.

361
00:24:58,695 --> 00:25:00,845
I can't let her
get away with this.

362
00:25:01,055 --> 00:25:03,125
I've gotta talk to her.

363
00:25:06,055 --> 00:25:07,374
FAY: Be sure you don't
wear that tonight.

364

Oh, no, madame.

365
00:25:11,775 --> 00:25:13,652
Get out.
But monsieur Ferris...

366
00:25:13,855 --> 00:25:16,050
Get out and stay out.

367
00:25:19,575 --> 00:25:21,213
The late Mr Ferris, I presume.

368
00:25:21,415 --> 00:25:23,804
Fay, I heard every word you said
to that cheap four-flusher Stanton.

369
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:25,647
I was sitting in the balcony,
right over your head.

370
00:25:25,855 --> 00:25:27,732
As an aerial umbrella,
you're a perfect drip.

371
00:25:27,935 --> 00:25:29,448
You've gotta listen, Fay,
this doesn't make sense.

372
00:25:29,655 --> 00:25:31,725
You can't work for Stanton after
all the shows we've done together.

373
00:25:31,935 --> 00:25:34,051
Think of my reputation.
Don't be tiresome.

What do you want
to do, ruin me?

375

Put me in bankruptcy?
Send me to jail?

376
00:25:38,095 --> 00:25:40,609
You know I've been mad about you
from the first time I laid eyes on you.

377
00:25:40,815 --> 00:25:43,170
You're my whole world. What do you
want to do, drive me to a madhouse?

378
00:25:43,455 --> 00:25:44,854
No, I'll call you a taxi.

379
00:25:45,055 --> 00:25:47,410
Listen, honey, you can't cast me
aside like an old shoe.

380
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:49,651
Don't be silly. Who's throwing
away old shoes nowadays?

381
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:52,534
Fay, if you come back to me,
we'll get right back on top again.

382
00:25:52,735 --> 00:25:53,963
I've got some great plans.

383
00:25:54,175 --> 00:25:56,973
Why, only this morning, I got you the
greatest proposition you've ever seen.

384
00:25:57,175 --> 00:25:59,484
What is it? Why, we'll sweep
right over Broadway again.

385
00:25:59,695 --> 00:26:01,606
We'll have lines ten blocks long
in front of our box office.

386
00:26:01,815 --> 00:26:03,168
We'll have them hanging
from the rafters.

387
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:04,933
And another thing: if you give
Stanton your notice today,

388
00:26:05,135 --> 00:26:06,363
I'll double your salary
in my next show.

389
00:26:06,575 --> 00:26:07,530
What do you think of that?

390
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,333
Oh, don't be mercenary.

00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:11,844
Money isn't everything,
if you can get it.

392
00:26:12,095 --> 00:26:14,325
Doesn't your conscience
ever bother you?

393
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:15,974
No, it amuses me.

Have you ever thanked me once
for everything I've done for you?

00:26:19,215 --> 00:26:21,570
I only answer $64 questions.

396
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:24,528
All right, Fay, you asked for it.

397

When I start fighting, I get mad,
and when I get mad, I bite nails in two.

All right, I'll get you
a priority on them.

Well, what can I investigate
for you today?

Any burlesque show
I ought to peep at?

No, darling,
no investigations.

I'll get you out of here.

myself just what my chances are for a stage career.

to be a famous star?

Oh, Andy, it's not
the fame I'm after.

00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:41,047
Hello, Fay.
Hello, Forrest.

605
00:36:41,255 --> 00:36:42,529
How are you, boys?

606
00:36:42,775 --> 00:36:46,211
We've been going through those new
choruses of "Can't be bothered" all evening.

607
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:49,094
Look, gentlemen, I wonder
if you'd please excuse us.

608
00:36:49,295 --> 00:36:51,650
Miss Lawrence and I have some
very important business to discuss.

609
00:36:51,855 --> 00:36:53,413
Thanks for the number, boys.

610
00:36:53,615 --> 00:36:56,766
and we'll wrap it up as a gift
before we give it to our public.

611
00:36:56,975 --> 00:36:58,328
Good night.

612
00:36:58,535 --> 00:37:01,129
Well, I'm glad to see you
in such a happy frame of mind.

613
00:37:01,335 --> 00:37:02,927
Won't you have a drink?
Thanks.

614
00:37:03,135 --> 00:37:04,887
I may need it.

615
00:37:07,495 --> 00:37:09,963
Fay, I have some news for you
that may be a shock.

616
00:37:10,175 --> 00:37:13,963
What is it?
I can't go on with the show.

617
00:37:14,175 --> 00:37:16,370
Oh, is that so?
You what?

618
00:37:16,615 --> 00:37:18,970
As a matter of fact, my backer,
who was to back me, has backed out.

619
00:37:19,175 --> 00:37:20,130
I haven't the money.

620
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:22,889
However, the show will go on and
I assume that you'll be the star.

621
00:37:23,095 --> 00:37:24,244
But I had to sell the production.

622
00:37:24,455 --> 00:37:26,366
Well, one man's money's
as good as another's.

623
00:37:26,615 --> 00:37:27,684
You may not like your producer.

624
00:37:27,935 --> 00:37:30,449
Oh, I like any producer
who produces.

625
00:37:30,655 --> 00:37:32,008
Who is he?
Tony Ferris.

626
00:37:32,255 --> 00:37:35,167
Tony Ferris.
Why, this is a catastrophe.

627
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:37,366
I'm sorry, Fay,
I had no other choice.

628
00:37:37,575 --> 00:37:39,054
After all, you two
have had hits before.

629
00:37:39,255 --> 00:37:40,893
Why, you don't know that guy.

630
00:37:41,095 --> 00:37:42,369
Why, this is terrible.

631
00:37:42,575 --> 00:37:45,294
Why, if he'd have been with Washington,
he'd have double-crossed the Delaware.

632
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:51,574
Hello, may I speak to
the district attorney, please?

633
00:37:51,775 --> 00:37:53,572
Hello, Hubert.

634
00:37:55,615 --> 00:37:57,526
Oh, uh, cancel it.

635
00:37:57,735 --> 00:37:59,453
Oh, I'm so glad
you gentlemen are here.

636
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:00,610
Glad to see you, Hubert.

637
00:38:00,815 --> 00:38:01,964
How is every little wrinkle?

638
00:38:02,175 --> 00:38:05,087
Thank you. I was just
calling up the district attorney.

639
00:38:05,295 --> 00:38:07,331
District attorney?
What for?

640
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:12,211
Well, I wanted to confess about
myself and you and Mr Mouse.

641
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,564
Confess what?

642
00:38:13,775 --> 00:38:17,324
About that telephone call
I made to Mr Stanton.

643
00:38:17,535 --> 00:38:19,730
I've felt terrible
about it ever since.

644
00:38:19,935 --> 00:38:21,448
I haven't slept a wink.

645
00:38:21,695 --> 00:38:24,493
I'm a sick man, Mr Ferris.

646
00:38:24,695 --> 00:38:26,572
I never lied in my life.

647
00:38:26,815 --> 00:38:28,646
Hubert, you can forget
about that call.

648
00:38:28,855 --> 00:38:29,810
Forget about it?

649
00:38:30,015 --> 00:38:31,448
Yeah, you never
made it, understand?

650
00:38:31,655 --> 00:38:33,532
Oh, but I did, Mr Ferris.
You remember, you were...

651
00:38:33,735 --> 00:38:34,850
I tell you,
you never made it.

652
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:36,972
But I did!
You don't remember.

653
00:38:37,175 --> 00:38:39,291
You've got two witnesses
to back you up.

654
00:38:39,495 --> 00:38:42,248
Who's the other witness, boss?
You, you dope.

655
00:38:42,455 --> 00:38:45,731
Do you mean you gentlemen
would really lie for me?

656
00:38:45,935 --> 00:38:47,084
Hubert, we'd die for you.

657
00:38:47,335 --> 00:38:52,125
Oh, you don't know what you've done for
me and for the Bainbridge Foundation.

658
00:38:52,335 --> 00:38:55,771
Why, Mr Stanton could have
sued us for every penny we have.

659
00:38:55,975 --> 00:38:57,533
So what?
Well, how much money can you have?

660
00:38:57,775 --> 00:39:08,925
Well, as of today,
there's $409,000.26

661
00:39:09,175 --> 00:39:11,689
Well, who's rationing
all that sugar?

662
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:13,527
Pardon me?

663
00:39:13,735 --> 00:39:15,691
I say, who's in charge
of the money?

664
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:16,930
Oh, I don't know.

665
00:39:17,135 --> 00:39:19,490
I guess I am, as long as
sister Hannah's away.

666
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:21,845
They couldn't have placed it
in better hands.

667
00:39:22,055 --> 00:39:24,853
I don't know why you men
are so good to me.

668
00:39:25,055 --> 00:39:26,204
You really wanna know?
Yes.

669
00:39:26,415 --> 00:39:30,408
I'll tell you, Hubert, anyone who cares as much about
his niece as you do must be the sweetest guy in the world.

670
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:32,287
And I'm a pushover for sweet guys.

671
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:35,527
This is no place for Janey
with her wonderful talent.

672
00:39:35,775 --> 00:39:37,766
Sure, we gotta get her out of here.

673
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,488
You mean it?
Sure.

674
00:39:39,695 --> 00:39:41,287
Why, that's our sacred duty.

675
00:39:41,495 --> 00:39:44,805
You really mean that you'll give
Janey a chance, Mr Ferris?

676
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:46,084
Hubert, you leave it to me.

677
00:39:46,295 --> 00:39:49,970
I'll fix you, you and Janey, like you've
never been fixed up before in all your life.

678
00:39:50,175 --> 00:39:52,052
Oh, Mr Ferris.

679
00:40:07,135 --> 00:40:09,126
Now you're gonna hear
something terrific.

680
00:40:09,335 --> 00:40:10,006
Yes.
Frank.

681
00:40:10,255 --> 00:40:12,132
Yes, sir.
Is Hazel Scott ready?

682
00:40:12,335 --> 00:40:13,404
It'll take a couple of minutes, boss.

683
00:40:13,615 --> 00:40:14,730
They're still putting
the pianos in place.

684
00:40:14,975 --> 00:40:16,328
I don't want any waits
between numbers.

685
00:40:16,535 --> 00:40:17,604
Get the next one
to follow immediately.

686
00:40:17,855 --> 00:40:20,005
The next will be the "Wabash" number.
We'll need Miss Adair.

687
00:40:21,935 --> 00:40:25,166
Honey, will you get dressed, please?
Right away, Mr Ferris.

688
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:27,013
Keep your fingers crossed.
Be good.

689
00:40:27,255 --> 00:40:30,850
Good luck, darling.
Thank you, Uncle.

690
00:40:31,335 --> 00:40:33,007
Will you look at this model, please?

691
00:40:33,215 --> 00:40:34,568
Let's see.

692
00:40:34,775 --> 00:40:37,209
No, that won't do, Rennie.
That's not massive enough.

693
00:40:37,415 --> 00:40:38,894
Don't forget, this is
a Tony Ferris production.

694
00:40:39,095 --> 00:40:41,051
I'm only trying to cut
corners a little, Mr Ferris.

695
00:40:41,255 --> 00:40:42,244
Who asked you to cut corners?

696
00:40:42,455 --> 00:40:45,015
What's 15 to 20,000 dollars
to a big musical like this?

697
00:40:45,215 --> 00:40:46,648
All right, Mr Ferris.
It is your money.

698
00:40:46,855 --> 00:40:47,810
Don't bother about my money.

699
00:40:48,015 --> 00:40:49,414
There's plenty more
where that came from.

700
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:54,009
Mr Ferris.
Yes?

701
00:40:54,215 --> 00:40:55,204
I'm worried.

702
00:40:55,415 --> 00:40:56,734
About my money?
No.

703
00:40:56,935 --> 00:40:58,846
Oh.
About the foundation's money.

704
00:40:59,055 --> 00:41:02,809
The way we're spending it,
I'm practically an embezzler.

705
00:41:03,015 --> 00:41:04,243
You're still vice-president,
aren't you?

706
00:41:04,455 --> 00:41:08,528
Only till Hannah gets back. After all, we're
supposed to close shows, not finance them.

707
00:41:08,735 --> 00:41:09,645
Oh, don't worry.

708
00:41:09,855 --> 00:41:14,371
By the time Hannah returns, you'll have all
your money back and maybe a $50,000 profit.

709
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:15,530
Maybe...

710
00:41:21,055 --> 00:41:25,970
<i>When the black keys meet
The white keys on Piano Avenue</i>

711
00:41:26,215 --> 00:41:32,006
<i>Do they music? They do</i>

712
00:41:32,215 --> 00:41:37,243
<i>They swing it in G
Corner of keyboard street</i>

713
00:41:37,455 --> 00:41:41,448
<i>The black and the white

Keep that boogie-vard awake</i>

715

<i>Make they music?
They make</i>

716
00:41:53,815 --> 00:41:59,173
<i>Like pepper and salt
Chocolate and malt, they zoot</i>

717
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:02,731
<i>The black and the white
Do it all right, all root</i>

718
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:08,531
<i>Oh, Mary Jane
Get off the beat</i>

719
00:42:09,135 --> 00:42:14,971
<i>Dig that refrain
It's sweeter than 8-point meat</i>

720
00:42:15,175 --> 00:42:17,564
<i>When the black keys
Join the white keys</i>

721

<i>In that barrel-house parade</i>

722
00:42:20,175 --> 00:42:25,203
<i>Plays it music?
It's played</i>

723
00:42:25,455 --> 00:42:30,575
<i>I'm telling you, jack
Stick to the black and white</i>

724
00:42:30,775 --> 00:42:35,530
<i>All reet, all root, all right</i>

725
00:45:21,495 --> 00:45:24,692
That was wonderful.
Didn't that make you tingle all over?

726
00:45:26,215 --> 00:45:28,649
Here's the "Wabash"
number, Mr Ferris.

727
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:35,085
MAN: Gee, it's been a wonderful leave.
WOMAN: Wonderful for me too.

728
00:45:35,295 --> 00:45:37,934
MAN: Gosh, I'm gonna miss
you, and the folks, and...

729
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,933
WOMAN: And who?
Well, you'd only laugh, if I told you.

730
00:45:41,135 --> 00:45:42,409
WOMAN:
No, I wouldn't.

731
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,810
MAN: Well, next to you,
I'm gonna miss the river.

732
00:45:45,015 --> 00:45:48,371
WOMAN: Oh, you had me
worried for a minute.

733
00:45:48,575 --> 00:45:51,043
<i>WOMAN:

<i>Thinking about the Wabash

738

A-rolling along in the moonlight</i>

739
00:46:14,895 --> 00:46:16,123
<i>Thinking</i>

740
00:46:16,335 --> 00:46:18,849
<i>Nothing to do but keep thinking</i>

741
00:46:19,055 --> 00:46:24,652

00:46:25,335 --> 00:46:30,568

00:58:03,735 --> 00:58:06,249
Look, operator, I want you
to get me Hannah Bainbridge.

907
00:58:06,455 --> 00:58:08,207
Seattle, Washington.

908
00:58:08,415 --> 00:58:12,124
She's the chairlady of the
Bainbridge convention there.

909
00:58:18,575 --> 00:58:21,772
<i>Over hill, over dale
We have hit the dusty trail</i>

910
00:58:21,975 --> 00:58:24,728
<i>And those caissons go rolling along</i>

911
00:58:24,975 --> 00:58:28,604
<i>Counter march, right about
Hear those wagon soldiers shout</i>

912
00:58:28,815 --> 00:58:31,454
<i>As those caissons
Go rolling along</i>

913
00:58:31,695 --> 00:58:35,210
<i>For it's hi-hi-hee
In the field artillery</i>

914
00:58:35,415 --> 00:58:38,612
<i>Call out your numbers
Loud and strong</i>

915
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:41,807
<i>And wherever we go
You will always know</i>

916
00:58:42,015 --> 00:58:44,324
<i>That those caissons
Are rolling along</i>

917
00:58:44,535 --> 00:58:49,086
<i>Keep 'em rolling
Those caissons are rolling along</i>

918
00:58:49,295 --> 00:58:51,855
<i>Attention!</i>

919
00:58:52,055 --> 00:58:55,127
<i>Let's boogie woogie</i>

920
01:00:23,335 --> 01:00:24,973
<i>Attention!</i>

921
01:00:27,535 --> 01:00:30,732
<i>Right face</i>

922
01:00:30,935 --> 01:00:34,211
<i>Column left, march!</i>

923
01:00:51,975 --> 01:00:53,328
What's on your mind, Harry?

924
01:00:53,535 --> 01:00:54,650
The bank just called, Mr Ferris.

925
01:00:54,855 --> 01:00:55,844
We're overdrawn again.

926
01:00:56,055 --> 01:00:58,728
Well, what did you do with the 10,000 Hubert
gave you Monday? Didn't you deposit it?

927
01:00:58,935 --> 01:00:59,924
Yes, but it's all gone.

928
01:01:00,135 --> 01:01:01,693
Well, we gotta watch ourselves.

929
01:01:01,895 --> 01:01:03,726
Another $20,000 ought to
see us through all right.

930
01:01:03,935 --> 01:01:05,163
All right, I'll get it
from Hubert tomorrow.

931
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:07,093
I guess you'll want to hold up
all these checks then.

932
01:01:07,295 --> 01:01:08,364
Oh, no, no.
Give them to me.

933
01:01:10,415 --> 01:01:12,610
You never put off until tomorrow
what you can do today.

934
01:01:12,815 --> 01:01:14,726
That's my motto.

935
01:01:14,935 --> 01:01:16,163
Go ahead, give them out.

936
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:17,330
Give them out?

937
01:01:17,535 --> 01:01:20,493
Yes, it's after 3.
All the banks are closed.

938
01:01:20,695 --> 01:01:22,287
Oh.

939
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:24,524
Hey, boss.
Yes?

940
01:01:24,735 --> 01:01:25,963
Are you in the mood
for a surprise?

941
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:27,728
I guess I can stand another one.

942
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:30,535
Okay, then. Wait'll you get
a load of this.

943
01:01:30,735 --> 01:01:35,445
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you now
Ezra Simpkins in "A Little Bit of Corn".

944
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:47,811
Shoo. Shoo.
Get out of here. Go on.

945
01:01:48,015 --> 01:01:49,243
You never lay any eggs here.

946
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:50,683
Go on home where you belong.

947
01:01:50,895 --> 01:01:52,487
Get out of here.

948
01:02:11,655 --> 01:02:15,773
Uncle, the postman just came and
brought you some more seed envelopes.

949
01:02:15,975 --> 01:02:19,854
Oh, dear, I've got more seeds
now than I know what to do with.

950
01:02:20,055 --> 01:02:21,454
How did you ever
get yourself into this?

951
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:25,085
I've always tried to be
a good American.

952
01:02:25,295 --> 01:02:28,093
And when this country went to war,

953
01:02:28,295 --> 01:02:30,763
the corner grocer told me,

954
01:02:30,975 --> 01:02:36,368
I ought to be a farmer
in my own backyard.

955
01:02:36,575 --> 01:02:42,172
And as I struggled from the store
with all the seeds he'd sold me,

956
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:48,894
he said, " Don't worry, pard,
it really isn't hard."

957
01:02:49,095 --> 01:02:53,213
<i>So I went and planted cabbages</i>

958
01:02:53,415 --> 01:02:57,124
<i>I figured I knew just how</i>

959
01:02:57,335 --> 01:03:02,409
<i>They looked so pretty
On the envelope</i>

960
01:03:02,615 --> 01:03:05,766
<i>But just take a look at them now</i>

961
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:15,048
<i>Then I planted beets and broccoli
Till my back began to bow</i>

962
01:03:15,255 --> 01:03:20,409
<i>For they looked so pretty
On the envelope</i>

963
01:03:20,615 --> 01:03:24,927
<i>But look at that broccoli now</i>

964
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:29,530
<i>The way my peas grow littler</i>

965
01:03:29,735 --> 01:03:33,171
<i>You'd think I worked for Hitler</i>

966
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:38,165
<i>The neighbours are reporting me
To Uncle Sam</i>

967
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:40,843
<i>That's the kind of a farmer I am</i>

968
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:44,491
<i>Oh, I pledged a crop for victory</i>

969
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:48,404
<i>And I'd like to keep that vow</i>

970
01:03:48,615 --> 01:03:53,052
<i>But alas, my vegetables
Look like rope</i>

971
01:03:53,255 --> 01:03:58,727
<i>They feel like Jell-O
And they taste like soap</i>

972
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:03,850
<i>Oh, they looked so pretty
On the envelope</i>

973
01:04:04,055 --> 01:04:08,048
<i>But look, look, look at them now</i>

974
01:04:11,375 --> 01:04:12,967
Hubert, you're dynamite.

975
01:04:14,255 --> 01:04:16,485
Well, thanks.
I'm glad you liked it.

976
01:04:16,695 --> 01:04:18,845
I thought we needed something
to follow Hazel Scott.

977
01:04:19,095 --> 01:04:22,007
Well, I don't think it quite fits into the show.
As you know, it's mostly a Latin background.

978
01:04:22,255 --> 01:04:24,530
Oh, I thought of that too, Mr Ferris.

979
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:27,886
I've got a special verse about
a Mexican jumping bean.

980
01:04:28,495 --> 01:04:30,372
Now, you run right along
and change your clothes.

981
01:04:30,615 --> 01:04:32,173
We'll talk about that later.

982
01:04:32,375 --> 01:04:33,933
I'm glad you liked it, though.

983
01:04:36,815 --> 01:04:39,204
HANNAH:
Hubert!

984
01:04:39,415 --> 01:04:40,609
Is this Seattle?

985
01:04:40,855 --> 01:04:44,086
So it's true. You have dragged
our name in the muck and mire.

986
01:04:44,335 --> 01:04:45,973
TONY: Madam, you're
interrupting my rehearsals.

987
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,285
Now, will you leave quietly, or
shall I have you thrown out bodily?

988
01:04:48,495 --> 01:04:49,564
If you lay one finger on me...

989
01:04:49,775 --> 01:04:51,174
Madam, will you kindly
take it on the lam?

990
01:04:51,415 --> 01:04:53,883
Aunt Hannah,
what are you doing here?

991
01:04:54,135 --> 01:04:56,490
Jane, your... Your legs!

992
01:04:56,735 --> 01:04:58,088
What's wrong with my legs?

993
01:04:58,335 --> 01:04:59,927
Have you no modesty?

994
01:05:00,135 --> 01:05:02,490
Do you think I'd let
any man see my legs?

995
01:05:02,695 --> 01:05:04,253
Do you think he'd want to?

996
01:05:04,455 --> 01:05:05,365
Sir. Who are you?

997
01:05:05,575 --> 01:05:07,054
Just the producer of the show.

998
01:05:07,255 --> 01:05:10,372
So you're the scoundrel who
hoodwinked my poor brother.

999
01:05:10,575 --> 01:05:11,974
Hubert and Jane,
come down here at once.

1000
01:05:12,215 --> 01:05:13,773
This little escapade is over.

1001
01:05:13,975 --> 01:05:14,930
Just a minute.

1002
01:05:15,135 --> 01:05:16,090
We have signed contracts.

1003
01:05:16,295 --> 01:05:17,694
You can't take that girl
out of my show.

1004
01:05:17,895 --> 01:05:22,013
Indeed I can. You're not dealing with my
weak-kneed brother and my guileless niece now.

1005
01:05:22,215 --> 01:05:23,694
You're dealing with
Hannah Bainbridge.

1006
01:05:23,895 --> 01:05:26,932
And that's a horse of another
colour. Horse is right.

1007
01:05:27,135 --> 01:05:29,126
Janey, come put this on.
this is disgraceful.

1008
01:05:29,375 --> 01:05:31,411
If you take them away, I won't
be able to produce this show.

1009
01:05:31,655 --> 01:05:35,091
Exactly. I have already notified my bank
to stop payments on any and all checks

1010
01:05:35,295 --> 01:05:37,047
my brother has drawn
to your benefit.

1011
01:05:37,255 --> 01:05:38,244
Your accounts are closed.

1012
01:05:38,495 --> 01:05:40,372
You will never see another cent
of the foundation's money.

1013
01:05:40,575 --> 01:05:42,850
But if I'm held responsible
for these claims, I go to jail.

1014
01:05:43,095 --> 01:05:44,847
Good. That's just
where you belong.

1015
01:05:45,095 --> 01:05:48,053
Come along now, come along.
And you too.

1016
01:05:48,255 --> 01:05:50,166
How were things in Seattle?
Never mind Seattle.

1017
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:51,330
I'll take care of that.

1018
01:05:51,575 --> 01:05:53,531
But I can't go out like this.

1019
01:05:53,735 --> 01:05:56,090
You get back to the supply room
where you belong.

1020
01:05:56,295 --> 01:05:58,934
But I want my clothes.
Never mind about your clothes!

1021
01:06:02,655 --> 01:06:05,123
I can't understand a thing
any more. My mind's a blank.

1022
01:06:05,335 --> 01:06:06,484
Mine too, boss.

1023
01:06:06,695 --> 01:06:11,166
We've got to get Fay back.
That's the only thing I know.

1024
01:06:11,375 --> 01:06:12,774
Mouse.
What?

1025
01:06:12,975 --> 01:06:15,648
If she was to hear that I was dead,
do you think she'd feel sorry for me?

1026
01:06:15,895 --> 01:06:17,328
She might.

1027
01:06:17,535 --> 01:06:19,014
Folks are awfully good
to dead people, you know.

1028
01:06:19,215 --> 01:06:20,694
You're right. I've got it.

1029
01:06:20,895 --> 01:06:21,884
Wait a minute, boss.

1030
01:06:22,095 --> 01:06:24,131
You ain't gonna bump yourself off
just to satisfy that dame, are you?

1031
01:06:24,335 --> 01:06:26,166
No. Fay's too smart
for anything like that.

1032
01:06:26,375 --> 01:06:29,447
But I've got a terrific idea
that'll work like a charm.

1033
01:06:30,775 --> 01:06:32,254
Who are you?
What are you talking about?

1034
01:06:32,495 --> 01:06:35,532
I'm Doctor Snyder,
of the Snyder Private Sanatorium.

1035
01:06:35,735 --> 01:06:38,169
Mr Tony Ferris has just
been brought in.

1036
01:06:38,375 --> 01:06:42,846
There's every symptom of an acute manic
depressive case, with complications.

1037
01:06:43,055 --> 01:06:44,886
He's been calling for you
all the time.

1038
01:06:45,095 --> 01:06:47,290
Your presence here
would be highly desirable.

1039
01:06:48,895 --> 01:06:50,851
All right, I'll be right over.

1040
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:55,286
A very complex case,
Miss Lawrence.

1041
01:06:55,495 --> 01:06:57,963
You can diagnose it
in ten different ways.

1042
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:01,326
In fact, you may take your pick
of paranoia, paranomia,

1043
01:07:01,535 --> 01:07:05,210
schizophrenia, mania grandiose
or dementia praecox.

1044
01:07:05,415 --> 01:07:07,485
Sounds like
a French menu to me.

1045
01:07:07,695 --> 01:07:09,014
I suggest that you would
see the patient.

1046
01:07:09,215 --> 01:07:10,568
I believe it may help him.

1047
01:07:10,775 --> 01:07:12,527
I'll be glad to take a look.

1048
01:07:12,735 --> 01:07:14,930
I must warn you, this may
prove to be a shock.

1049
01:07:15,135 --> 01:07:17,649
Well, that's all right too.

1050
01:07:20,135 --> 01:07:22,603
This way, Miss Lawrence.

1051
01:07:22,815 --> 01:07:26,205
This is one of the most complicated
cases I have ever encountered.

1052
01:07:26,415 --> 01:07:28,053
Hello, Miss Lawrence.

1053
01:07:32,495 --> 01:07:35,328
What's that, lady?
You want a ticket for the show?

1054
01:07:35,535 --> 01:07:37,014
We're sold out for ten years.

1055
01:07:37,215 --> 01:07:38,250
But just a minute.

1056
01:07:38,455 --> 01:07:39,649
I have one seat left.

1057
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:42,130
A wonderful seat

1058
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:44,206
Hey, boss, Miss Lawrence is here.

1059
01:07:44,455 --> 01:07:48,130
Bravo! Bravo!
What a wonderful show.

1060
01:07:48,335 --> 01:07:50,166
What a great success.

1061
01:07:52,135 --> 01:07:53,090
That guy's nuts.

1062
01:07:53,295 --> 01:07:55,809
He won't recognise anybody
anymore, not even you.

1063
01:07:56,015 --> 01:07:57,767
When did this happen?
This morning, Miss Lawrence.

1064
01:07:57,975 --> 01:08:00,489
When that dame from Seattle
took all the dough out of the show.

1065
01:08:00,695 --> 01:08:03,004
At first he was sort of all right,
then all of a sudden, zing!

1066
01:08:03,215 --> 01:08:05,410
His mind snapped.
It was awful.

1067
01:08:05,615 --> 01:08:08,083
Even I cried a little.

1068
01:08:08,335 --> 01:08:13,170
To be, or not to be:
that is the question...

1069
01:08:14,775 --> 01:08:19,166
<i>Poor Tony. Who would've thought he'd switch to
Shakespeare after reading Police Gazette all these years.</i>

1070
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:20,569
Yeah, it is tough, isn't it?

1071
01:08:20,775 --> 01:08:22,288
Uh-huh. What's happening
to the play meanwhile?

1072
01:08:22,535 --> 01:08:24,605
Nothing. It's going
to pieces, I guess.

1073
01:08:24,815 --> 01:08:26,487
I think I'll take it over.
You'll what?

1074
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:28,805
Take over the show.
You know, the play's the thing.

1075
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,044
Not this one, it ain't.

1076
01:08:30,255 --> 01:08:32,849
No dough at all, and his checks
are bouncing all over the town too.

1077
01:08:33,095 --> 01:08:34,608
Well, maybe I can
promote someone.

1078
01:08:34,855 --> 01:08:37,892
MOUSE: Oh, he's been to all the places
already and couldn't get a penny.

1079
01:08:38,135 --> 01:08:40,091
I think I know a spot
he hasn't touched.

1080
01:08:40,295 --> 01:08:42,490
<i>You know, I always did like
Tropicana and I want to be in it.</i>

1081
01:08:42,735 --> 01:08:44,453
Fay, wait a minute!

1082
01:08:44,655 --> 01:08:46,134
Wait a minute!

1083
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:48,525
With you back in the show,
I can promote it myself.

1084
01:08:48,735 --> 01:08:49,770
Take it easy, Mr Ferris, please.

1085
01:08:49,975 --> 01:08:50,964
Take your hands off me.

1086
01:08:51,175 --> 01:08:52,494
You don't really think
I'm crazy, do you?

1087
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:54,572
Of course, not. You're just
a little nervous. Herbie!

1088
01:08:56,975 --> 01:08:58,727
The gentleman's upset.
You'd better take care of him.

1089
01:08:58,935 --> 01:09:00,163
This is an outrage.
I'll sue you!

1090
01:09:00,375 --> 01:09:01,444
Why don't you let him relax?

1091
01:09:01,655 --> 01:09:02,883
Take your paws off me,
you big gorilla.

1092
01:09:03,135 --> 01:09:05,808
Acute paranoia, and
a very dangerous case.

1093
01:09:06,015 --> 01:09:08,290
Then you'll keep him here a while?
Oh, yes.

1094
01:09:08,495 --> 01:09:10,213
But someone must sign
the commitment papers.

1095
01:09:10,415 --> 01:09:13,293
I will. That's the least
I can do for poor Tony.

1096
01:09:13,535 --> 01:09:15,765
Fay. You're not gonna
leave me here.

1097
01:09:15,975 --> 01:09:17,931
I'm perfectly normal, I swear.

1098
01:09:18,175 --> 01:09:22,726
A tale told by an idiot, full of
sound and fury, signifying nothing.

1099
01:09:22,935 --> 01:09:25,574
Incidentally, that's Shakespeare
too. Let's go, doctor.

1100
01:09:25,815 --> 01:09:27,931
Cut it out, will you? Listen
to me, will you, please?

1101
01:09:28,135 --> 01:09:29,568
Miss Lawrence, please.

1102
01:09:29,775 --> 01:09:31,731
You ain't gonna leave the
boss in this nut farm, are you?

1103
01:09:31,935 --> 01:09:34,495
Why not? With him staying here
and not mixing things up,

1104
01:09:34,695 --> 01:09:37,129
I may be able to pull him out
of the hole he dug himself into.

1105
01:09:37,375 --> 01:09:39,445
Fay, it was just a gag
to get you back.

1106
01:09:39,655 --> 01:09:40,690
There's nothing wrong with me.

1107
01:09:40,935 --> 01:09:43,495
Just listen to the way he's
fighting back there. It's awful.

1108
01:09:43,695 --> 01:09:45,413
Miss Lawrence, please,
do something.

1109
01:09:45,615 --> 01:09:46,604
I will.

1110
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:50,046
In fact, I'm off to open
a second front of my own.

1111
01:09:55,695 --> 01:09:59,210
Hubert.
Fay, er, Miss Lawrence.

1112
01:09:59,415 --> 01:10:01,770
Oh, am I glad to see you.

1113
01:10:01,975 --> 01:10:07,254
<i>Hannah found out about my advancing money
for Tropicana and she's awful mad at me.</i>

1114
01:10:07,455 --> 01:10:11,494
I'm supposed to be in the supply room,
right now, with my face to the wall.

1115
01:10:11,735 --> 01:10:15,045
Well, I'm here to get you out,
and I've got an idea that's a lily.

1116
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,887
Oh, I love lilies.

1117
01:10:17,095 --> 01:10:19,086
This is my niece, Janey,
Miss Lawrence.

1118
01:10:19,295 --> 01:10:22,128
Oh, this is the little girl with the career
and doesn't know what to do with it, huh?

1119
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:25,492
Well, I'm afraid, Miss Lawrence, I won't
get a chance to do anything with it now.

1120
01:10:25,735 --> 01:10:27,566
Well, anyone can
have a career.

1121
01:10:27,775 --> 01:10:29,094
Why not be different?
Don't have one.

1122
01:10:29,295 --> 01:10:31,490
Oh, but she has
true natural talent.

1123
01:10:31,695 --> 01:10:34,050
Well, haven't we all?
Where's your sister, Hannah?

1124
01:10:34,295 --> 01:10:36,172
She's in there.

1125
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:37,933
Oh, I wanna get to the bottom
of this foundation.

1126
01:10:38,135 --> 01:10:40,490
Oh, but you mustn't go in now.
She's terribly angry.

1127
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:43,255
And she won't see anybody.
Not anybody.

1128
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:46,333
She's having tea.
Oh. She's having tea.

1129
01:10:46,535 --> 01:10:49,254
Well, I'm gonna give her
a little TNT.

1130
01:10:57,015 --> 01:10:58,494
Miss Bainbridge, am I right?

1131
01:10:58,695 --> 01:11:02,574
Who are you?
My card.

1132
01:11:02,775 --> 01:11:04,128
The Queen of Hearts?

1133
01:11:04,335 --> 01:11:06,212
Pardon me, the other side.

1134
01:11:15,295 --> 01:11:16,967
Fay Lawrence. Hmm.

1135
01:11:17,175 --> 01:11:18,893
That strikes a familiar chord.

1136
01:11:19,135 --> 01:11:21,490
Well, I'm a familiar figure
around town.

1137

<i>I know. You were the star
of Indiscretions.</i>

You're the Fay Lawrence
that does this.

1139
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:28,973
[HUMMING "LITTLE EGYPT"]

1140
01:11:29,175 --> 01:11:32,724
Great. Only don't let
the clutch out so fast.

1141
01:11:32,975 --> 01:11:34,124
Is that what I did?

1142
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:35,728
Oh, but good.

1143
01:11:35,975 --> 01:11:39,126
I... I don't think I care to prolong
this interview, Miss Lawrence.

1144
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:40,490
Just a minute.

1145
01:11:40,695 --> 01:11:43,732
I happen to know that the Bainbridge
Foundation has feet of clay,

1146
01:11:43,935 --> 01:11:45,573
and brother Hubert has
a little mud on his shoes.

1147
01:11:45,815 --> 01:11:46,770
What do you mean?

1148
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:48,528
You know what I mean.

1149
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:52,853
<i>Hubert did a little job of embezzling
to back Tropicana with your funds.</i>

1150
01:11:53,055 --> 01:11:54,966
Oh, I guess he didn't realise
what he was doing,

1151
01:11:55,175 --> 01:11:57,166
but I'm afraid if it got
into the newspapers...

1152
01:11:57,415 --> 01:11:59,770
No, no, please. You
wouldn't. Not the newspapers.

1153
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:02,210
That's why I'm here,
to keep it out of the papers.

1154
01:12:02,455 --> 01:12:03,854
It must be kept out.

1155
01:12:04,055 --> 01:12:07,013
It would be a fatal blow
to our name and tradition.

1156
01:12:07,215 --> 01:12:09,285
Why, my ancestors
came over on the mayflower.

1157
01:12:09,535 --> 01:12:12,129
Oh, you're lucky.
Now we have immigration laws.

1158
01:12:12,375 --> 01:12:14,411
I only acted upon
the reports given me.

1159
01:12:14,615 --> 01:12:16,173
I must speak to my brother.

1160
01:12:19,015 --> 01:12:22,564
Hubert. Come in here.

1161
01:12:22,775 --> 01:12:24,413
Yes, Hannah, did you call me?

1162
01:12:24,615 --> 01:12:26,845
Come here.

1163
01:12:27,055 --> 01:12:30,206
Hubert, how much did this
adventuress take you for?

1164
01:12:30,415 --> 01:12:33,134
He's so cute, I only
took him for granted.

1165
01:12:33,335 --> 01:12:35,451
Well, you don't
understand, Hannah.

1166
01:12:35,655 --> 01:12:39,125
It was Mr Ferris to whom
I advanced the $40,000.

1167
01:12:39,335 --> 01:12:45,012
40,000! We will pay it all back to the foundation
if I have to mortgage my entire holdings.

1168
01:12:45,255 --> 01:12:46,483
Now, don't be hasty.

1169
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:49,687
<i>Another 20,000 will open Tropicana
and keep your name out of the papers.</i>

1170
01:12:49,935 --> 01:12:53,814
You're not suggesting I become a Broadway
producer and finance a theatrical venture?

1171
01:12:54,055 --> 01:12:56,615
Well, you're holding the bag. You
may as well have something in it.

1172
01:12:56,855 --> 01:12:58,811
No, no, I can't do it.

1173
01:12:59,015 --> 01:13:00,528
I can't bring myself to do it.

1174
01:13:00,775 --> 01:13:02,970
Oh, come, come, Hannah,
you're in a rut.

1175
01:13:03,215 --> 01:13:06,890
You'd better. If you don't,
I may go to jail.

1176
01:13:07,095 --> 01:13:09,404
Oh, you wouldn't want everyone
calling you hard-hearted Hannah.

1177
01:13:09,615 --> 01:13:11,094
And it only takes
one cheque, Hannah.

1178
01:13:11,295 --> 01:13:12,887
You'll have lots of them left
in that book.

1179
01:13:13,135 --> 01:13:17,606
I don't know. It's against
all my finer instincts.

1180
01:13:17,855 --> 01:13:21,484
Come on. Sit down and put your autograph
on a cheque and let's get out of here.

1181
01:13:28,655 --> 01:13:30,134
Make it out to Tony Ferris.

1182
01:13:30,335 --> 01:13:33,964
Very well, but on the strict understanding
that Jane does not set one foot on that stage.

1183
01:13:34,175 --> 01:13:35,847
Is that understood?

1184
01:13:36,055 --> 01:13:38,205
All right, you've got
my word for it.

1185
01:13:39,455 --> 01:13:42,253
Golly. Now I can come
and watch you rehearse.
