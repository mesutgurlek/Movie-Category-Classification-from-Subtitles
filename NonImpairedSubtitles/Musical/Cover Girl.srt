00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:23,685
<i>The show must go on</i>

3
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:27,808
<i>To answer all the clamour</i>
<i>For oomph and glamour and so on</i>

4
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:32,406
<i>To captivate Tom, Dick and Harry</i>
<i>Each Matilda, Kay and Carrie</i>

5
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:36,278
<i>Cleopatra and DuBarry</i>
<i>Puts her show on</i>

6
00:01:36,449 --> 00:01:40,442
<i>Way back in history</i>
<i>Old Adam didn't give a care</i>

7
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:44,761
<i>There was no mystery</i>
<i>A rag, a bone, a hank of hair</i>

8
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:48,888
<i>But since humanity</i>
<i>Discovered vanity</i>

9
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,837
<i>We only know the show must go on</i>

10
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:02,403
<i>We only know the show must go on</i>

11
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:07,962
<i>This clever lyrical endeav our</i>
<i>Could probably go on forever</i>

12
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:11,724
<i>But all we're saying is what you know</i>

13
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:15,723
<i>That glamour is a woman's show</i>

14
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:18,608
<i>The show most people lik e to view</i>

15
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:22,808
<i>Is evident in burlesque</i>

16
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:25,164
<i>That show must go on</i>

17
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:26,762
<i>The show must go on</i>

18
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:28,328
<i>The show must go on</i>

19
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:31,367
<i>To answer all the clamour</i>
<i>For oomph and glamour and so on</i>

20
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:34,407
<i>But since humanity</i>

21
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:38,642
<i>We only know the show must go on</i>

22
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:42,848
<i>But the show we show</i>
<i>Is different because</i>

23
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:47,207
<i>We don't depend on this</i>
<i>Nor this for applause</i>

24
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:52,519
<i>That sort of thing</i>
<i>We scornfully dismiss</i>

25
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:55,408
<i>For</i>

26
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:57,287
<i>This</i>

27
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:37,202
<i>We only know the show must go on!</i>

28
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:41,287
Hey, Genius!

29
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:43,081
Coming.

30
00:03:46,649 --> 00:03:49,721
Oh, those poor people.

31
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:52,997
The entertainment can start.
The Genius is here.

32
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:57,845
Don't let the customers hear. The house
can be emptied in three minutes.

33
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,167
Listen, kids.

34
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:05,288
That number's still ragged. On your
entrance, keep your heads down.

35
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:09,442
- Our mothers told us not to do it.
- You can't teach old daughters new tricks.

36
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:12,442
We'll see if I can
at 9:00 tomorrow morning.

37
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:14,043
Rehearsals are at 10.

38
00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:17,844
Go on, you got five minutes
to make your change.

39
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:20,366
Those little dames can sure gripe.

40
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:22,759
The bigger the gripe,
the better the army, Jim.

41
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,523
- And there is a great army.
- You're not kidding.

42
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:27,242
Well, I just won't show up.

43
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:29,877
I have an appointment at 9:00,
and I'll keep it.

44
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:33,041
It's my chance to get out of here
and into the big time.

45
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:36,884
- What big time?
- The big time has nothing to do with 9:00.

46
00:04:37,049 --> 00:04:39,847
- You got a line on a job, Maurine?
- You bet I have.

47
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:42,477
It has nothing to do with 9:00 either,
or 10:00.

48
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,162
You can sleep all day.

49
00:04:44,369 --> 00:04:49,079
- I've never heard of a job like that.
- No? Here, look for yourself.

50
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:52,480
Not that I think I'm the most
beautiful girl in the world...

51
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:54,446
...but I think I can at least try.

52
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:57,880
"<i>Vanity</i>'s Golden Wedding Girl.
Fame and fortune await the girl...

53
00:04:58,049 --> 00:05:00,961
...on the cover
of <i>Vanity</i>'s 50th anniversary number.

54
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:04,360
Who will she be? She could be you."

55
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:08,078
How could getting your face on
a magazine get you into the big time?

56
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:10,484
A cover girl's face can unlock
any door.

57
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:13,288
- I've got a face. I'll use it.
- I don't understand.

58
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:16,282
If you can do better,
why should Mr. McGuire object?

59
00:05:16,489 --> 00:05:19,640
The McGuire slogan is to get there
on your feet, not your face.

60
00:05:20,049 --> 00:05:23,325
Can you imagine me asking him?

61
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:03,637
My name is Rusty Parker.

62
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:08,001
Parker.

63
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:11,878
Could I see Mr. Coudair
about th<i>e Vanity</i> cover?

64
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:16,361
Miss Jackson, Mr. Coudair's assistant,
does interviews. She'll try to see you.

65
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:18,406
Thank you.

66
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:37,040
What on earth are you doing here?

67
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:39,882
Oh, same thing you are, I guess.

68
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:41,960
You shouldn't be
such a good salesman.

69
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:44,563
Does Danny know you came?

70
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:47,482
Well, I didn't tell him,
if that's what you mean.

71
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:50,163
He's gonna be sore at me. But you...

72
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:52,559
...egads, he'll cut you up
in little pieces.

73
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:54,765
Well, he doesn't have to know.

74
00:06:54,929 --> 00:06:56,487
Does he, Maurine?

75
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:58,241
No, of course not.

76
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:03,007
Save it, kitties. Don't waste it on me.

77
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:06,282
That redhead isn't bad.

78
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:07,564
No, she isn't.

79
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:09,685
All right, Marion, let the bars down.

80
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:12,317
Carry on, Colby.

81
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:14,957
Maurine Martin, please.

82
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,844
Egads, wish me luck.

83
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:25,045
That girl has a really lovely figure...

84
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:26,642
...if she knew how to walk.

85
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:28,123
Ever done any modelling?

86
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:31,087
No, but all you have to do is keep still,
isn't it?

87
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:32,364
That always helps.

88
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:34,840
Does it matter I've never modelled?

89
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:36,960
No, in this case, we prefer it.

90
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:41,327
Now sit down and stand up
again several times.

91
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:50,448
I mean stand.

92
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:57,559
You're a very pretty girl,
little on the brash side, however.

93
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:01,722
Our girl has to be quiet and demure.
After all, the cover is a bride.

94
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:07,682
Who's the girl with you,
the one with the red hair?

95
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:10,158
Oh, she works in the same joint...

96
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:12,559
I mean, the same nightclub
in Brooklyn I do.

97
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:15,402
Danny McGuire's. Why?

98
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:16,798
She's pretty.

99
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:20,200
Now smile directly at me.

100
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:21,768
And she looks relaxed.

101
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:27,242
If only you gals could realise how
important it is to be quiet and relaxed.

102
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:33,877
Nice teeth.

103
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:37,485
Keep your nightlife down and
your hopes up. You may hear from us.

104
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:40,038
Thank you.

105
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:44,842
Goodbye.

106
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:49,327
B.J. Graham.

107
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,762
Are my seams straight?

108
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:54,727
They're all right, darling.

109
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:58,280
Don't make the mistakes I made.

110
00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:02,158
Keep talking and move around a lot.
Be animated.

111
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:05,560
That's what they're after. Even if you
overdo it, be animated.

112
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:08,687
Don't relax for a minute.
Don't let her know you're new.

113
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:12,159
Say anything, but impress it on her
you've modelled before.

114
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:15,446
- But I haven't.
- Rusty Parker.

115
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:20,237
Don't forget. Be animated.

116
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:40,204
Hello! How do you do?

117
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,209
My name is Rusty Parker.
And you're Miss Jackson.

118
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:46,961
I've heard so much about you.

119
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,962
I suppose you've noticed
I'm so full of animation...

120
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:52,199
...it's impossible for me to sit still.

121
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:55,645
My grandmother said it's because
my glands worked right.

122
00:09:55,849 --> 00:09:58,409
I suppose you'd like to know
about my experience.

123
00:09:58,569 --> 00:10:00,719
I've done so much,
all kinds of things.

124
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:03,767
I've been on more bottles...
Cold cures are my specialty.

125
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:07,086
You know, sneezes and animated stuff,
things like that.

126
00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:09,046
I have some photographs here...

127
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,200
I'd rather you wouldn't take them out.

128
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:13,883
I don't feel up to capturing them
if they get loose.

129
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:17,405
I think there's something you can take.
I'd find out about it.

130
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:19,088
Take? For what?

131
00:10:19,249 --> 00:10:23,527
Those glands. They're going to turn
on you one of these days.

132
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:30,160
But why can't I be
the Golden Wedding Girl, Mr. Coudair?

133
00:10:30,369 --> 00:10:33,486
Your face is familiar to everyone
who picks up a magazine.

134
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:36,686
- I want a new face.
- I don't blame you. So do I.

135
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:41,161
What is a new face anyway? I hear
about them, but I've never seen one.

136
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:42,882
All right, Mr. Coudair.

137
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:48,567
But I don't know how a bride can be
new and experienced at the same time.

138
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,768
- May I come in?
- It won't do you any good.

139
00:10:51,969 --> 00:10:55,041
Your face isn't new enough.

140
00:10:55,249 --> 00:10:56,364
Fine thing!

141
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:00,678
I saw the Golden Wedding Dress.
It's a dream. Don't you love it?

142
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:04,478
For now, there's nothing
about this contest I love. It's beautiful.

143
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:07,561
If you got me a dress like that,
I'd marry anybody.

144
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:11,688
Then I'll be very careful not to, Jinx.
We need you in our business.

145
00:11:11,849 --> 00:11:13,680
Stonewall, there's the layout.

146
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:16,886
The dress is ready. There's
the deadline. Where's the face?

147
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:20,359
I have brought you 10,000 batches
of photographs by slow count.

148
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:23,760
Colby and I have been looking too.
You're very hard to please.

149
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:27,365
- You don't know what you want.
- I know exactly what I want.

150
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:31,886
- I want a girl with a story in her eyes.
- Drawing room or smoking room?

151
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:36,958
What does a young girl think about
when she's going down the aisle?

152
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,085
That's the look I want...

153
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:41,160
...that young, wondering, misty look.

154
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:44,127
Well, now we have a clue, Jinx.
She must be misty.

155
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,365
I can find you a lot of foggy ones.

156
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:48,042
Thanks for helping us, Jinx.

157
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:52,398
Somebody helped me to get started,
didn't they? Bye.

158
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:54,367
John, I'm desperate.

159
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:57,965
There isn't a thing that Harry Conover
hasn't made well-known...

160
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:02,964
...except this one. She's at least new.
We've got to choose somebody.

161
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:06,804
Very pretty girl.
Let me go take a look at her.

162
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:11,287
This mania you have for peering at
these creatures in their native haunts...

163
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:14,361
I should know after all these
years I can't change you.

164
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:16,884
Is this one worth going to Brooklyn
to see?

165
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:19,085
Where on earth is that?

166
00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:22,446
I think you take a bridge to get there.

167
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:28,279
- Evening, Pop.
- Oh, hello, girls.

168
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:29,768
Hello, Danny.

169
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:35,003
If you'd had a horse under you in North
Africa instead of one of them tanks...

170
00:12:35,169 --> 00:12:38,445
...you wouldn't have got shot up
the way you was and sent home.

171
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:40,281
Where'd it get you, Danny?

172
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:42,167
In Libya.

173
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:45,127
Well, it don't show a bit.

174
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:48,279
- Evening, Pop.
- Cold out, ain't it, Rusty?

175
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:50,167
Sure is.

176
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:52,160
Hi, chicken.

177
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:54,638
Hello, Danny.

178
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:59,158
Missed you for breakfast, lunch
and dinner. Don't you eat anymore?

179
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:02,366
- I wasn't hungry tonight.
- Weren't you hungry this morning?

180
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:06,363
Who stole my nylons? Egads, a very...

181
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:09,362
- Not very.
- Too much rehearsal last night, huh?

182
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:12,282
- It was kind of a workout.
- That why you slept late?

183
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:14,758
Oh, I didn't sleep late. I went uptown.

184
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:15,918
Shopping?

185
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:20,281
No, I went to see a man...

186
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:21,484
...about a face.

187
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:24,083
I thought you went to buy me
a wedding present.

188
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:26,080
Why? You getting married?

189
00:13:26,249 --> 00:13:27,568
Didn't you hear?

190
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:29,367
Why, no, Mr. McGuire.

191
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:31,087
And who is the lucky girl?

192
00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:36,528
She's kind of a funny kid. She's sore
because she's got diamonds in her feet.

193
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:38,884
Can you imagine that?

194
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:43,002
Rusty, not many people have
diamonds in their feet.

195
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:47,478
They threw me out, Danny.
They didn't want me up there.

196
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:49,446
They didn't like my face.

197
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:54,481
You've got a beautiful face. Is it your
worry they don't know their business?

198
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:56,162
Well, I get so tired, Danny.

199
00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:59,685
This way, it takes so long
before you get anywhere.

200
00:13:59,849 --> 00:14:02,204
If you can get there quicker,
why shouldn't you?

201
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:04,758
When you get there quick,
you're out quick.

202
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:07,284
Easy get, easy lose.
I've never seen it fail.

203
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:09,280
You gotta work for what you get.

204
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:15,524
You're gonna be a star, but you gotta
get there on your feet, not your face.

205
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:18,560
Old shortcut Susie.

206
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:22,085
Old hard way McGuire.

207
00:14:22,249 --> 00:14:24,080
We're a fine pair.

208
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:26,683
We're a wonderful pair.

209
00:14:26,849 --> 00:14:30,046
Aren't we though?

210
00:14:33,729 --> 00:14:37,165
Dally, dally, dally. Nothing around here
all day but dilly-dally.

211
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:38,444
I better get dressed.

212
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:41,487
I said it 100 times.
You don't get there on the steps.

213
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:44,766
You get there on your...
But it depends on what you're after.

214
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:47,966
Day and night, night and day,
all I do is work and slave...

215
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:50,689
...to keep this place
with its head underwater.

216
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,965
My number comes up,
it goes to pieces.

217
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:58,362
People sitting on the steps, chef quitting,
noisy kitchen, girls always gabbing.

218
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:00,201
- I'm not complaining.
- You're on.

219
00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:02,519
Coming!

220
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:07,720
<i>My butcher shop</i>
<i>My grocery</i>

221
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:09,925
<i>Can k eep on saying no, sirree</i>

222
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:12,045
<i>But lack of this</i>
<i>Or that</i>

223
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:14,165
<i>Doesn't knock me flat</i>

224
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:15,921
<i>Foreign times lik e these</i>

225
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:18,080
<i>Life's no life of these</i>

226
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:20,160
<i>Although I'm no saint</i>

227
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:22,320
<i>I have no complaint</i>

228
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,207
<i>We must do that task</i>

229
00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:26,166
<i>And it's little enough</i>

230
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:28,638
<i>They ask:</i>

231
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:30,686
<i>"Who's Complaining?"</i>

232
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:32,646
<i>I'm not complaining</i>

233
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:36,597
<i>You'll see</i>
<i>We'll see this thing through</i>

234
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,762
<i>Because of Axis' trick ery</i>
<i>My coffee now is chicory</i>

235
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:45,161
<i>And I can rarely purloin</i>
<i>A sirloin</i>

236
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:47,081
<i>No complaining</i>

237
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:48,967
<i>Through the campaigning</i>

238
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:52,883
<i>Who cares if carrots are few</i>

239
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:55,609
<i>I'll feed myself on artichok es</i>

240
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:58,966
<i>Until that Nazi Party chok es</i>

241
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:01,120
<i>So long as they don't ration</i>

242
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:04,361
<i>My passion</i>
<i>For you</i>

243
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:10,687
<i>You know if things go on</i>
<i>At the rate they're going</i>

244
00:16:10,849 --> 00:16:13,602
<i>And goods flow out</i>
<i>At the rate they're flowing</i>

245
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:19,446
<i>The time isn't very far away</i>
<i>When this will be my typical day</i>

246
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:25,002
<i>At breakfast time just after I get up</i>
<i>If there's little on the breakfast setup</i>

247
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:28,047
<i>For the little I'm served</i>
<i>I'm well repaid</i>

248
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:31,963
<i>By the little that's on the serving maid</i>

249
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:40,768
<i>The trip downtown</i>
<i>Which once was boring</i>

250
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:43,568
<i>Now's a journey I k eep adoring</i>

251
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:47,404
<i>A man is a dope who yells and storms</i>

252
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:51,039
<i>At the lack of the drivers' uniforms</i>

253
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:57,768
<i>And at the office during the duration</i>

254
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:00,318
<i>What a pleasure giving dictation</i>

255
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:03,128
<i>It ain't so bad in the land of the free</i>

256
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,564
<i>Being a dictator lik e me</i>

257
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:13,407
<i>And when my lady and I go dining</i>

258
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:15,525
<i>Though the menu's cloudy</i>
<i>There's a silver lining</i>

259
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:17,078
That's the one.

260
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:19,558
<i>A fellow just looks around the floor</i>

261
00:17:19,729 --> 00:17:22,163
<i>Who could ask for anything more?</i>

262
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,081
<i>Who could ask for anything more?</i>

263
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:27,760
<i>Who's complaining?</i>
<i>I'm not complaining</i>

264
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:31,968
<i>The sacrifices are few</i>

265
00:17:32,129 --> 00:17:35,087
<i>- My shoes may not be leathery</i>
<i>- My pillow not so feathery</i>

266
00:17:35,249 --> 00:17:36,967
<i>My legs may be forgotten</i>

267
00:17:37,129 --> 00:17:39,006
<i>In cotton</i>

268
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:40,847
<i>No complaining</i>

269
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:42,567
<i>Through the campaigning</i>

270
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:46,244
<i>I'll raise no hullabaloo</i>

271
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:48,127
<i>My nails may lose their brilliancy</i>

272
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:50,245
<i>But who cares what civilians see</i>

273
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:52,843
<i>So long as they don't ration</i>
<i>My passion</i>

274
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:54,965
<i>For you</i>

275
00:17:57,649 --> 00:18:00,721
Good night. Happy kitchen.

276
00:18:01,729 --> 00:18:04,880
Good night. Happy office.

277
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:07,247
Good ni...

278
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:13,248
Good night. Happy taxi.

279
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:23,961
Good night. Happy smoking.

280
00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:29,399
Have that girl come
and see me tomorrow.

281
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:33,562
I'm glad you liked her. I thought she
was quite unusual-looking for a blond.

282
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:35,560
No, the one with the red hair.

283
00:18:35,729 --> 00:18:39,438
Oh, the red hair. Oh, the red hair!

284
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:45,567
I'll be in the study for calls.

285
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:50,484
I don't know why you pay me if you
ignore my judgment. Stop whistling!

286
00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:54,801
I wear myself out, wading through
10,000 girls, and out of the 10,000...

287
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:58,803
...you choose a redheaded nervous
breakdown who specializes in sneezes.

288
00:18:58,969 --> 00:19:00,482
She told me so.

289
00:19:00,649 --> 00:19:04,085
That one isn't a girl, John.
She's a leaping thyroid.

290
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:08,888
I don't believe I've been in a honky-tonk
place like McGuire's for 40 years.

291
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:13,839
I don't know why I've saved this. Take a
look at it. You're interested in antiques.

292
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:17,686
If we got her for our cover...

293
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:20,642
- But, John, this is her.
- Who?

294
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:22,999
The... The girl, the gland case.

295
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,048
This program is dated 40 years ago.
How could it be?

296
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,967
Well, it couldn't be, but it is.

297
00:19:29,729 --> 00:19:32,527
Forty years ago.

298
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:38,683
The night I got this, I was sitting
in a box with Tony Pastor.

299
00:19:42,729 --> 00:19:45,562
<i>She was the most beautiful thing</i>
<i>I'd ever seen.</i>

300
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:49,041
<i>I fell in love with her</i>
<i>the minute I saw her.</i>

301
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:57,762
<i>The fav ourite doesn't always win</i>
<i>No matter what the odds</i>

302
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:00,602
<i>Since nobody knows</i>
<i>How they'll come in</i>

303
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:03,567
<i>I leave it to the gods</i>

304
00:20:03,729 --> 00:20:09,725
<i>So wish me luck</i>
<i>Because I'm going to bet on</i>

305
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:12,722
<i>A sentimental hunch</i>

306
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:19,283
<i>My heart is suddenly set on</i>

307
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:24,046
<i>Somehow, I'm sure I've found</i>

308
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:28,122
<i>The sure thing in you</i>

309
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:30,849
<i>Something within</i>

310
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:35,284
<i>Tells me we'll win</i>

311
00:20:35,449 --> 00:20:37,485
<i>Somewhere, my heart</i>

312
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:42,120
<i>Has pick ed you out of the blue</i>

313
00:20:42,369 --> 00:20:45,122
<i>And since I'm only a beginner</i>

314
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:49,123
<i>A winner I'll be</i>

315
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:52,167
<i>But win or lose</i>
<i>Whatever comes up</i>

316
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:55,924
<i>You're thumbs up</i>
<i>With me</i>

317
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,684
<i>One thing I'm sure I'm sure of</i>

318
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:02,363
<i>All my life through</i>

319
00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:07,477
<i>If love can figure out a sure thing</i>

320
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:13,963
<i>That sure thing is you</i>

321
00:21:14,449 --> 00:21:17,725
<i>After the races are over</i>

322
00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:21,199
<i>After the races are run</i>

323
00:21:21,369 --> 00:21:24,839
<i>Loser or winner</i>
<i>Let's go out to dinner</i>

324
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:28,206
<i>And let's have a little</i>
<i>Let's have a little fun</i>

325
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:31,486
<i>Let's go to Rector's or Shanley's</i>

326
00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:35,119
<i>Champagne and duck are divine</i>

327
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:38,247
<i>Let's lose our troubles</i>
<i>Imbibing some bubbles</i>

328
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:42,038
<i>Oh, let's have a little</i>
<i>Let's have a little wine</i>

329
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:45,519
<i>Then when we're mellow</i>
<i>And feeling alive</i>

330
00:21:45,689 --> 00:21:51,286
<i>Let's tak e a drive along Riverside Drive</i>

331
00:21:51,449 --> 00:21:55,283
<i>No drive in the country for me after dark</i>

332
00:21:55,449 --> 00:21:59,283
<i>My limit is just once around</i>

333
00:21:59,449 --> 00:22:02,486
<i>Central Park</i>

334
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:06,119
<i>After the races are over</i>

335
00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:10,077
<i>Being with you will be bliss</i>

336
00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:13,639
<i>Perhaps you'll surrender</i>
<i>When gentlemen tender</i>

337
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:17,848
<i>Say, "Let's have a little</i>
<i>Let's have a little kiss!"</i>

338
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:22,205
<i>Though you are tender</i>
<i>I cannot surrender</i>

339
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:26,408
<i>To "Let's have a little</i>
<i>Let's have a little kiss!"</i>

340
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:53,560
<i>Somehow I'm sure I've found</i>

341
00:22:53,729 --> 00:22:57,324
<i>The sure thing in you</i>

342
00:22:57,489 --> 00:23:00,925
<i>Taking romance</i>

343
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:04,638
<i>I tak e no chance</i>

344
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:08,085
<i>Somewhere my heart has pick ed you</i>

345
00:23:08,249 --> 00:23:11,764
<i>Out of the blue</i>

346
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:16,127
<i>But if it turns out that my long shot's</i>
<i>A wrong shot</i>

347
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:18,120
<i>Should be</i>

348
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:21,167
<i>And all my castles come a' tumbling</i>

349
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:25,004
<i>No grumbling from me</i>

350
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:28,366
<i>Long shot</i>
<i>One thing I'm sure of</i>

351
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:31,839
<i>All my life through</i>

352
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:36,048
<i>If love can figure out a sure thing</i>

353
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:40,043
<i>That sure thing</i>

354
00:23:40,209 --> 00:23:45,920
<i>Is you</i>

355
00:23:51,249 --> 00:23:53,763
- I've got to meet her, Mr. Pastor.
- Now, John...

356
00:23:53,929 --> 00:23:57,888
...last time, your mother had the
Decency League investigate my place.

357
00:23:58,049 --> 00:24:00,358
Mother's quite a girl.
Shall we go backstage?

358
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:03,760
No. Now, in the first place,
Maribelle's already spoken for.

359
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:06,648
See that boy at the piano?

360
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:09,639
- Don't bother me with trifles.
- And, John...

361
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:12,926
...I promised your mother I wouldn't
introduce you to girls.

362
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:17,048
Maribelle isn't just another girl,
Mr. Pastor.

363
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:20,440
I'm going to marry her.

364
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:22,440
John. John!

365
00:24:24,849 --> 00:24:26,919
- I'm ready, darling.
- Wonderful, so am I.

366
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:30,638
John, have you lost your mind?

367
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:33,363
At your most beautiful service,
mademoiselle.

368
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:34,803
Well.

369
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:37,165
- Miss Hicks, how are you?
- Who is this?

370
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:40,366
- I never saw him before in my life.
- I'm John Coudair.

371
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:43,566
The only thing in your life,
so make the best of it.

372
00:24:43,729 --> 00:24:48,439
If anyone should enquire for us, we've
gone to Rector's to discuss our future.

373
00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:51,363
Unless it's my mother.
Then you haven't seen me.

374
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:53,485
Now just a minute.

375
00:24:53,649 --> 00:24:56,368
You're a perfectly enchanting person,
Mr. Coudair.

376
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:59,362
Not even bad-looking,
in a strange sort of way.

377
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:02,885
But I have an engagement, and it's
not with you or at Rector.

378
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:04,562
- But...
- I don't even know you.

379
00:25:04,729 --> 00:25:07,766
What's the difference?
This was meant to be. Can't you see?

380
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:09,760
You don't belong in a dingy hole.

381
00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:12,682
You should be surrounded
by luxury, beauty, elegance.

382
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:15,283
I can give you these things, Maribelle.

383
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:20,648
Just climb aboard my magic carpet,
and away we'll go.

384
00:25:21,329 --> 00:25:24,480
From Rector's we went on to...

385
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:27,641
Pardon me.

386
00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:30,844
Yes.

387
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,282
Oh, dear, I forgot all about it.

388
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,565
Yes, I'll look it over immediately.

389
00:25:36,729 --> 00:25:38,765
Thanks for reminding me.

390
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:42,166
That advertising prospectus...

391
00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:45,168
That advertising prospectus
the lender sent over.

392
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:46,887
Completely slipped my mind.

393
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:48,767
- Good night.
- Hey, wait a minute.

394
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:52,285
What does Maribelle got to do
with this kid? Are they related?

395
00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:54,565
I haven't the faintest idea.

396
00:25:54,729 --> 00:26:00,042
By the way, don't wait until tomorrow.
Send that child a wire tonight, will you?

397
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:02,607
<i>- Hello, Joe</i>
<i>- What do you know?</i>

398
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,158
<i>- I just came back from a bing-bang show</i>
<i>- A sing and a dance</i>

399
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:06,967
<i>- I'll tak e a chance</i>
<i>- Well, flippity-jippity</i>

400
00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:09,120
<i>- Let's go!</i>
- Okay.

401
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:16,638
Come on, pearl.

402
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:21,082
- Oh, how I hate oysters.
- Ain't they repulsive?

403
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:23,238
I don't get it.

404
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:26,879
Every Friday night for the last
six months, they order oysters.

405
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:28,482
Then they don't eat them.

406
00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:31,887
- We don't like oysters.
- Joe, we're looking for a pearl.

407
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:35,359
The night we find that pearl,
that'll be it. It'll be an omen.

408
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:38,362
That'll be the time
when things break for all three of us.

409
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:39,644
- You know what?
- What?

410
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:43,006
I think it's a fake. I don't think
pearls comes from oysters.

411
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:46,605
- Pearls don't come from oysters.
- How long since you left Harvard?

412
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:48,686
Never heard of it. Be reasonable.

413
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:51,044
How could a oyster give birth
to a pearl?

414
00:26:51,249 --> 00:26:53,285
How could an oyster give birth
to an oyster?

415
00:26:53,449 --> 00:26:55,360
Hey, that's something to think about.

416
00:26:55,529 --> 00:26:58,362
Let them live their lives,
and I'll live mine.

417
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:00,485
- When? I wanna see that.
- I don't.

418
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:02,685
Oh, you fools, you.

419
00:27:02,849 --> 00:27:06,364
Rusty, did you find a pearl?

420
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:08,440
- No pearls.
- No pearls.

421
00:27:08,649 --> 00:27:10,162
Well, better luck tomorrow.

422
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,081
Tomorrow!

423
00:27:12,249 --> 00:27:14,717
Here we go again.

424

<i>Let's k eep on singing,</i>

428

<i>Don't give in!</i>
<i>Let's give out!</i>

429
00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:33,525
<i>To the blues</i>
<i>Just refuse to surrender</i>

430
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:37,125
<i>One smile</i>
<i>And you are a true, solid sender</i>

431
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:39,359

432
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:41,042
<i>It only rains out of doors!</i>

433
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:43,200
<i>Let every frown disappear</i>

434
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:47,203
<i>And you'll find that tomorrow's here</i>

435
00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:54,286
<i>Listen, all</i>
<i>This is Genius calling</i>

436

<i>- Hear ye!</i>
<i>- Hear ye!</i>

437
00:27:56,329 --> 00:27:59,958
<i>- Why not gather rainbows while ye may?</i>
<i>- While ye may?</i>

438
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:03,007
<i>You can lose the gremlins</i>
<i>The goblins, the glooms</i>

439
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:06,161
<i>Laugh and they're back in their tombs</i>

That's pretty. That's very, very pretty.

451
00:30:20,729 --> 00:30:23,323
Glad to see you.

452
00:30:24,249 --> 00:30:25,568
Hi, Mac.

453
00:30:25,729 --> 00:30:28,846
Hello, Harry.

454
00:30:36,129 --> 00:30:38,927
Maybe it's a draft notice.

455
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,358
Danny, it's from John Coudair.

456
00:30:44,529 --> 00:30:45,518
Who's he?

457
00:30:45,689 --> 00:30:48,567
He publishes that magazine
that wants a...

458
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:51,482
He wants me to come
to the office tomorrow.

459
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,480
What do you suppose happened?

460
00:30:53,649 --> 00:30:55,958
How did he ever...?

461
00:30:56,129 --> 00:30:59,087
One hour rehearsal at 10, honey.
I'll see you then.

462
00:30:59,249 --> 00:31:02,844
Yeah, I'll try to make it, Danny.
Good night.

463
00:31:17,729 --> 00:31:18,957
I don't feel good.

464
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:21,563
Oh, you don't? Where?

465
00:31:21,729 --> 00:31:23,879
In the hall.

466
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:27,359
I felt sick the minute you got
the telegram. Didn't you, Danny?

467
00:31:27,569 --> 00:31:30,845
I think Rusty knows what she wants
to do with her own life.

468
00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:34,285
- Lf she wants to go it alone...
- I don't wanna go it alone.

469
00:31:34,449 --> 00:31:37,759
I wanna go it with you, Danny, but...

470
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,965
Well, the man sent for me, Genius.

471
00:31:40,129 --> 00:31:43,280
It just doesn't seem polite not to...

472
00:31:43,449 --> 00:31:45,280
Well, he might not even like me.

473
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:46,882
Ever see a man that didn't?

474
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:49,358
- Skip it, will you?
- No, I won't skip it.

475
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:53,681
I've got some stock in this corporation,
and I'm certainly going to protect it.

476
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:57,159
I like Danny McGuire's Place
and you two there every night.

477
00:31:57,369 --> 00:31:58,768
I like oysters and...

478
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:01,762
- You hate oysters.
- Ain't they repulsive?

479
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:06,161
Then I like opening oysters, and I like
the clowning around in Joe's Place...

480
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:09,366
...and the laughs and the music
and everything.

481
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:13,283
I like that pearl we're gonna find.

482
00:32:15,649 --> 00:32:18,117
You don't want this.

483
00:32:20,249 --> 00:32:22,319
Do you?

484
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:37,325
Now you two say good night
like you mean it.

485
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:50,243
Good night, chicken.

486
00:32:53,729 --> 00:32:56,243
Night, Danny.

487
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:08,040
You're a genius at everything but
minding your own business, aren't you?

488
00:33:08,969 --> 00:33:12,086
A girl's got a right to make up
her mind about her own life.

489
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:14,888
Why didn't you let her tear up
her own telegram?

490
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:18,166
It's things like this that make me
a genius. Ain't they?

491
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,719
Wait until the landlady sees the hall.

492
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:26,279
All right, I'll clean it up.

493
00:33:26,449 --> 00:33:28,724
Big thing.

494
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:47,488
<i>- Rusty Park er to see you.</i>
- Send her right in please.

495
00:33:50,449 --> 00:33:52,519
All right, I'm trying not to be excited.

496
00:33:52,689 --> 00:33:55,328
What would you do if your youth
walked in the door?

497
00:33:55,489 --> 00:33:58,640
I'd put braces on its teeth.

498
00:34:00,209 --> 00:34:02,404
- Hello.
- Hello.

499
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:04,844
Come in.

500
00:34:09,689 --> 00:34:11,884
This is Mr. Coudair, Miss Parker.

501
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:20,038
- How do you do, Miss Parker?
- How do you do?

502
00:34:21,249 --> 00:34:24,605
Well, you have ambitions
to be a cover girl?

503
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:28,045
Well... I did have.

504
00:34:30,209 --> 00:34:32,848
I find Miss Parker exceptionally reposed.

505
00:34:33,009 --> 00:34:35,728
- I thought you told me that she leaped.
- She did leap.

506
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:40,644
What happened to that lovely, gay,
rose- in-the- teeth personality you had?

507
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:42,766
- Did I look like that?
- Exactly.

508
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:46,080
No wonder you threw me out.
I'm not a very good actress, am I?

509
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:47,603
That was acting?

510
00:34:48,569 --> 00:34:50,161
That was acting.

511
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:52,286
Sit down, won't you?

512
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:56,203
We saw you, quite by accident,
at Danny McGuire's Place last night.

513
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:58,917
- You dance beautifully.
- I've had good training.

514
00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:02,001
Apparently.
It seems to come to you so naturally...

515
00:35:02,169 --> 00:35:06,208
...I was wondering if someone
in your family were a dancer.

516
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:07,961
Your mother, perhaps?

517
00:35:08,129 --> 00:35:10,689
Oh, no.
My mother couldn't dance a note.

518
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:13,568
- She raised cattle.
- Cattle?

519
00:35:15,969 --> 00:35:19,678
My grandmother was a dancer.
I don't suppose you ever heard of her.

520
00:35:19,849 --> 00:35:23,364
- Maribelle Hicks?
- Your grandmother?

521
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:26,760
Oh, my goodness,
how time flies, doesn't it?

522
00:35:28,049 --> 00:35:29,607
She was kind of a star.

523
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:33,478
Well, it seems I've mislaid
a few years somewhere.

524
00:35:33,649 --> 00:35:37,528
Is she living, Miss Parker?
Your grandmother?

525
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:43,037
- No, she died about six months ago.
- I see.

526
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:48,318
- All right, let's get to work.
- When I think what I've gone through...

527
00:35:48,489 --> 00:35:53,244
...trying to find a girl who all the time was
in your desk drawer, I could scream.

528
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:56,761
- I suppose you're finished with me.
- Finished with you?

529
00:35:56,929 --> 00:35:59,489
My dear child,
we're just beginning with you.

530
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:03,728
Just climb aboard my magic carpet
and away we'll go.

531
00:37:45,249 --> 00:37:47,558
Did you know Rusty
won this contest, Maurine?

532
00:37:47,729 --> 00:37:51,517
Not until this came out today.
That double- crossing little so-and-so.

533
00:37:51,689 --> 00:37:55,887
- I don't think Danny knows it either.
- She takes a swell picture, doesn't she?

534
00:37:56,129 --> 00:37:58,040
Anyone would with
the trouble they go to.

535
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,723
Your grapes are so sour
I can smell them from here.

536
00:38:00,889 --> 00:38:02,720
Be with you in a minute, kids.

537
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:04,083
Pretty.

538
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:05,841
Oh!

539
00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:07,601
What are you...?

540
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:10,488
- In the mood to be great again tonight?
- Yeah, I'm...

541
00:38:10,649 --> 00:38:12,924
Singing and dancing
all the time, that's me.

542
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:15,649
Oh, you're such a joy
and comfort to us all.

543
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:18,642
Yeah, I'm a joy and a...

544
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:24,925
- Oh, by the way, Genius...
- By the what?

545
00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:27,125
Oh. The way.

546
00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:32,885
- What's the matter with you?
- Just trying out a new step. Like it?

547
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:35,279
- Cut the clowning, will you?
- Who's clowning?

548
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:38,088
You're sitting on a piece of paper.

549
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:41,924
Isn't he silly? Have I got time to sit
on paper? I'm not even sitting.

550
00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:43,841
- Go bake a cake.
- Genius, you're on.

551
00:38:44,009 --> 00:38:46,079
Coming!

552
00:38:56,449 --> 00:38:59,009
Danny, didn't you say
she could live her own life?

553
00:38:59,169 --> 00:39:00,966
Genius!

554
00:39:01,129 --> 00:39:04,041
Go ahead, let them have the face.
You got what's left.

555
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:06,677
- Genius, you're on!
- Yes.

556
00:39:15,129 --> 00:39:17,245
Hi.

557
00:39:17,569 --> 00:39:19,958
Hi, yourself.

558
00:39:20,729 --> 00:39:24,324
- I think it's swell. Congratulations.
- Well, thank you, Danny.

559
00:39:24,569 --> 00:39:28,881
I think it's swell. Like you said, if you can
get there quicker, why shouldn't you?

560
00:39:29,049 --> 00:39:32,405
- Danny, you wanna know something?
- What?

561
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:35,766
You were right that
you don't get there on your face.

562
00:39:35,929 --> 00:39:38,807
That magazine's been out all day
and nothing's happened.

563
00:39:38,969 --> 00:39:40,766
Nothing.

564
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:44,205
I guess I thought the sky
would fall in or something.

565
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:47,998
Well, it didn't.

566
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:53,802
This puts me in a great spot, chicken.
If I'm sorry nothing came of it, I'm a liar.

567
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:56,722
If I'm glad, I'm a heel.

568
00:39:56,889 --> 00:39:59,687
Where do we go from here?

569
00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:02,882
Dancing around the world, Danny.

570
00:40:03,049 --> 00:40:04,687
On my feet.

571
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:12,922
Sure, I'll marry you. Who is this?
Who?

572
00:40:13,089 --> 00:40:15,762
Th<i>e New York News</i>?

573
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,757
Yeah, she works here.

574
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:46,402
- This it?
- This is it. We covered the waterfront.

575
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,799
You have to dig to find a precious stone.

576
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:51,358
It's up to you to put her
in her proper place.

577
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:54,441
Brooklyn to Broadway in one cover,
that's quite a jump.

578
00:40:54,609 --> 00:40:57,407
She has an old magic carpet
that came in mighty handy.

579
00:40:57,889 --> 00:41:00,449
- I have a reservation. John Coudair.
- Your hat, sir?

580
00:41:00,609 --> 00:41:03,407
Oh, yes, Mr. Coudair. This way, sir.

581
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,198
- Hello, children.
- Hello.

582
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:11,041
- Hello, Colby.
- Hello, Jinx.

583
00:41:11,209 --> 00:41:14,918
- Hello. Good hunting, son.
- Thanks, pal.

584
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:49,803
<i>The days of the good old knights are gone</i>

585
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:53,882
<i>But chivalry still carries on</i>

586
00:41:54,049 --> 00:41:56,279

00:42:07,049 --> 00:42:09,005

00:42:09,169 --> 00:42:13,640

592

00:42:48,089 --> 00:42:51,047
<i>Put me to the test</i>

602
00:44:57,929 --> 00:45:01,080
- Oh, stop looking like an old mother cat.
- What do you think?

603
00:45:01,249 --> 00:45:04,719
Why didn't you tell me she had talent,
besides being exciting, beautiful...

604
00:45:04,889 --> 00:45:07,039
What do I think?

605
00:45:10,769 --> 00:45:13,920
- Is this what you want?
- Yeah!

606
00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:18,566
Ladies and gentleman,
your favourite cover girl...

607
00:45:18,729 --> 00:45:22,688
...and my favourite dancer, Rusty Parker.

608
00:45:27,009 --> 00:45:29,762
- You didn't bring a trumpet, did you?
- Why a trumpet?

609
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:31,965
I want to make an impressive entrance.

610
00:45:32,209 --> 00:45:34,803
- Nice going, Rusty.
- Gee, you really...

611
00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:38,120
- Remember what he used to...?
- Knew what she was talking about.

612
00:45:38,289 --> 00:45:41,042
- It was a wonderful feeling.
- What are you crying about?

613
00:45:41,209 --> 00:45:43,564
I don't know.

614
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:47,006
Kids, imagine a star being born to
parents like me and Danny?

615
00:45:47,169 --> 00:45:49,637
More like someone
giving birth to an earthquake.

616
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:51,367
Break it up, break it up.

617
00:45:51,529 --> 00:45:54,726
Rusty's skipping the next number.
Take the girls on, will you?

618
00:45:54,889 --> 00:46:00,202
Thanks. I'm the act that follows the act.
Give me some lights. I'll murder them.

619
00:46:00,449 --> 00:46:04,567
Rusty, this happens to very few people.
Take care of it and treat it right.

620
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:06,560
I beg your pardon.
Oh, here you are.

621
00:46:06,729 --> 00:46:09,846
I've been in the theatre many years,
and I've never seen...

622
00:46:10,009 --> 00:46:11,328
Excuse me, please.

623
00:46:11,489 --> 00:46:14,799
As I was saying, I've been in the
theatre a number of years and...

624
00:46:14,969 --> 00:46:19,281
- As I was saying, I've been in the theatre...
- I'm beginning to believe that.

625
00:46:19,529 --> 00:46:21,201
- Hello, Rusty.
- Hello, Mr. Coudair.

626
00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:23,644
Hello, Miss Jackson.
Danny, these are...

627
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:26,369
- Well, this is Mr. McGuire.
- How do you do, sir?

628
00:46:26,529 --> 00:46:27,848
I was saying that I've...

629
00:46:28,009 --> 00:46:30,728
This gentleman has been in theatre
a good many years.

630
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:34,086
You've been in my theatre many
years too. Why don't you scram?

631
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,479
- Of course we'll go. We...
- That's all right.

632
00:46:36,649 --> 00:46:39,038
You're perfectly welcome
to stay, but this guy...

633
00:46:39,209 --> 00:46:42,246
This guy is with us, Mr. McGuire.
We brung him.

634
00:46:42,409 --> 00:46:44,969
- I'm sorry.
- That's my one virtue: Nice friends.

635
00:46:45,129 --> 00:46:48,804
Rusty, this is Noel Wheaton of
Wheaton's Theatre. This is Mr. McGuire.

636
00:46:48,969 --> 00:46:51,005
- Hello. How are you?
- One side, please.

637
00:46:51,169 --> 00:46:54,047
We're a little crowded here.
Would you mind moving?

638
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:56,723
- Forgive us.
- Make yourselves at home, will you?

639
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:59,403
Look, people with clothes on.

640
00:46:59,569 --> 00:47:02,129
I have to get on next.
Would you excuse me? Maurine.

641
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:04,325
- Coming.
- Miss Parker...

642
00:47:04,609 --> 00:47:07,407
- Oh, hello, Miss Jackson.
- Hello.

643
00:47:07,569 --> 00:47:10,561
Why didn't you tell me
you wanted somebody animated?

644
00:47:10,729 --> 00:47:13,163
I was just holding myself in
when I was in your...

645
00:47:13,329 --> 00:47:16,685
- Have you gone batty or something?
- Is it something in me...

646
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:19,443
...that brings that out in people?
- Sorry.

647
00:47:19,729 --> 00:47:21,959
Can't we go to your
dressing room and talk?

648
00:47:22,129 --> 00:47:25,963
- Well, I dress with seven other girls.
- You dress with seven other girls?

649
00:47:26,129 --> 00:47:30,327
Yes, and they talk a lot
and get dressed and undressed...

650
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:35,644
Wouldn't it be simpler if we just lay down
and let them walk over us?

651
00:47:35,809 --> 00:47:39,563
- I don't know why we're here anyway.
- We're offering Miss Parker a job.

652
00:47:39,729 --> 00:47:43,039
- Oh, but I have a job.
- Rusty, you gotta make that change.

653
00:47:43,209 --> 00:47:44,847
- Mr. McGuire.
- Excuse me.

654
00:47:45,009 --> 00:47:47,682
We are definitely in the man's way here.
Let's find...

655
00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:50,568
How do you feel about
selling Miss Parker's contract?

656
00:47:50,729 --> 00:47:52,321
Miss Parker has no contract.

657
00:47:52,489 --> 00:47:56,402
- No... Oh, what are we waiting for?
- I don't know. What are you waiting for?

658
00:47:56,569 --> 00:47:59,083
Miss Parker's free to
work for me if she wants?

659
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:02,162
Miss Parker'd be free to work for you
if she wanted to...

660
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:04,923
...whether she'd signed a paper or not.

661
00:48:05,089 --> 00:48:08,445
You don't understand people
working together that way, do you?

662
00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:11,885
- No, I don't.
- No, you wouldn't.

663
00:48:12,129 --> 00:48:14,484
- Make your change, Rusty.
- Okay.

664
00:48:14,649 --> 00:48:19,962
- Well, I hope I see you again sometime.
- You'll see nothing but me, beautiful.

665
00:48:20,129 --> 00:48:24,805
That sounds very exciting,
coming from the great Noel Wheaton.

666
00:48:26,129 --> 00:48:29,565
You know, he said you were free to
come work for me if you wanted.

667
00:48:29,729 --> 00:48:34,245
- I know he did. Good night.
- Good night.

668
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:39,808
- I guess my trumpet was out of tune.
- I thought I heard a sour note.

669
00:48:39,969 --> 00:48:42,437
Baby! You were wonderful tonight.

670
00:48:42,609 --> 00:48:46,158
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I mistook you for somebody else.

671
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:49,321
- Glad to see you.
- So sorry.

672
00:48:49,489 --> 00:48:51,605
Excuse me.

673
00:48:53,769 --> 00:48:56,567
- Oh, wait!
- Gangway.

674
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:14,527
- Busy little place tonight, wasn't it?
- Yeah, wasn't it?

675
00:49:14,689 --> 00:49:17,886
One had to chop one's way through
the upper crust, didn't one?

676
00:49:18,049 --> 00:49:20,358
Yeah, one did.

677
00:49:20,529 --> 00:49:22,281
Shortcuts are no good, huh?

678
00:49:22,449 --> 00:49:26,078
They only make you famous overnight.
That's all. No work, no nothing.

679
00:49:26,249 --> 00:49:29,400
Just smile at the birdie,
and boom! You're in.

680
00:49:30,249 --> 00:49:36,358
Name in all the papers. Big stars
sending you pretty dresses for nothing.

681
00:49:36,529 --> 00:49:38,281
That was terrific tonight.

682
00:49:38,649 --> 00:49:40,879
You bet it was terrific.

683
00:49:41,049 --> 00:49:43,517
Best goodbye music
I ever danced to.

684
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:49,488
Yeah, tonight was really terrific.

685
00:49:49,649 --> 00:49:53,358
See a thing like that happen
right under your eyes.

686
00:49:53,529 --> 00:49:56,760
Something you wanted for someone
all their life.

687
00:49:56,929 --> 00:49:59,682
You haven't known me all my life.

688
00:49:59,849 --> 00:50:02,488
Six months then.

689
00:50:03,449 --> 00:50:04,802
Seven.

690
00:50:06,449 --> 00:50:08,565
Seven then.

691
00:50:09,449 --> 00:50:15,763
Seven months, three days,
four hours, 23 minutes.

692
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:18,523
It was Tuesday.

693
00:50:19,609 --> 00:50:24,524
<i>Long ago and far away</i>

694
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:28,238
<i>I dreamed a dream one day</i>

695
00:50:28,409 --> 00:50:33,847
<i>And now that dream is here beside me</i>

696
00:50:34,009 --> 00:50:38,844
<i>Long the skies were overcast</i>

697
00:50:39,009 --> 00:50:42,399
<i>But now the clouds have passed</i>

698
00:50:42,569 --> 00:50:48,565
<i>You're here at last</i>

699
00:50:48,729 --> 00:50:53,883
<i>Chills run up and down my spine</i>

700
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:57,598
<i>Aladdin's lamp is mine</i>

701
00:50:57,769 --> 00:51:03,162
<i>The dream I dreamed was not denied me</i>

702
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:05,684
<i>Just one look</i>

703
00:51:05,849 --> 00:51:09,637
<i>And then I knew</i>

704
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:15,041
<i>That all I longed for</i>

705
00:51:15,209 --> 00:51:20,647
<i>Long ago was you</i>

706
00:51:28,689 --> 00:51:32,079
<i>I dreamed a dream one day</i>

707
00:51:32,249 --> 00:51:37,198
<i>And now that dream is here beside me</i>

708
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:41,408
<i>Long the skies were overcast</i>

709
00:51:41,569 --> 00:51:45,357
<i>But now the clouds have passed</i>

710
00:51:45,529 --> 00:51:50,478
<i>You're here at last</i>

711
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:55,882
<i>Chills run up and down my spine</i>

712
00:51:56,049 --> 00:51:59,405
<i>Aladdin's lamp is mine</i>

713
00:51:59,569 --> 00:52:04,484
<i>The dream I dreamed was not denied me</i>

714
00:52:04,649 --> 00:52:07,243
<i>Just one look</i>

715
00:52:07,409 --> 00:52:11,243
<i>And then I knew</i>

716
00:52:12,809 --> 00:52:17,644
<i>That all I longed for</i>

717
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:24,123
<i>Long ago was you</i>

718
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:22,558
Egad, this place looks
like a funeral parlour.

719
00:53:22,729 --> 00:53:24,799
Nobody cares if roses give
me hay fever.

720
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:27,278
- Where are your shoes?
- In the dressing room!

721
00:53:27,449 --> 00:53:29,360
- Get them!
- I can't! The dressing room...

722
00:53:29,529 --> 00:53:32,043
...is full of photographers taking
pictures of the mirror!

723
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,278
For Pete's sake, why?

724
00:53:33,449 --> 00:53:38,603
It's gonna be in the Sunday paper. The
mirror where Rusty first saw her face.

725
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,724
- Mr. McGuire.
- I know. Do the best you can.

726
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:44,562
That newspaperwoman is eating
my precious food.

727
00:53:44,729 --> 00:53:47,960
She is doing a story on what food
makes the figure of Rusty Parker.

728
00:53:48,129 --> 00:53:50,085
- I said, do the best you can.
- I quit.

729
00:53:50,249 --> 00:53:52,240
All right, then quit!

730
00:53:52,449 --> 00:53:53,438
- Genius.
- Yes.

731
00:53:53,609 --> 00:53:55,486
- Where is Rusty? Find her.
- Relax.

732
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:58,641
She's all right. She's on the stage
being interviewed.

733
00:54:00,729 --> 00:54:03,482
- I'm 10 minutes slow.
- Are the flowers from Mr. Wheaton?

734
00:54:03,649 --> 00:54:05,879
Yes, every hour, on the hour,
for a week.

735
00:54:06,049 --> 00:54:08,085
Can you tell us about their romance?

736
00:54:08,249 --> 00:54:10,285
Which of you did she love
before Mr. Wheaton?

737
00:54:10,449 --> 00:54:12,167
It was I, but I beat her.

738
00:54:12,329 --> 00:54:15,321
Mr. McGuire. Smile.

739
00:54:20,249 --> 00:54:22,365
- Where's Rusty?
- We want her autograph.

740
00:54:22,529 --> 00:54:24,679
Wait outside. We're trying to rehearse.

741
00:54:24,849 --> 00:54:27,886
- Give me your autograph.
- You don't even know who I am.

742
00:54:28,049 --> 00:54:29,038
Yes, I do.

743
00:54:29,209 --> 00:54:32,599
- You're Rusty Parker's boyfriend.
- I'll tell him when he comes.

744
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:36,085
You can have my autograph.
Single file. I'll take you first.

745
00:54:36,249 --> 00:54:37,284
You ain't nobody.

746
00:54:37,449 --> 00:54:40,919
Maybe we can catch her
out in the alley. Come on!

747
00:54:42,649 --> 00:54:45,288
Just a minute. The girls
are too busy to see you.

748
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:48,327
- Glad to see you.
- Glad to see you.

749
00:54:58,129 --> 00:55:01,519
That's fine, John. Play billiards
while my theatre falls apart.

750
00:55:01,689 --> 00:55:03,680
- Good afternoon.
- What's good about it?

751
00:55:03,849 --> 00:55:07,046
It's another day for me to worry about
how I'll open my show.

752
00:55:07,209 --> 00:55:10,167
Now I'm sending roses
every 15 minutes.

753
00:55:10,369 --> 00:55:14,885
You got me this way. Do something.
I tried everything this side of kidnapping.

754
00:55:15,089 --> 00:55:16,841
What is this side of kidnapping?

755
00:55:17,049 --> 00:55:18,960
Please don't be humorous.

756
00:55:19,169 --> 00:55:21,046
You're humorous, both of you.

757
00:55:21,209 --> 00:55:23,040
You're attempting the impossible:

758
00:55:23,209 --> 00:55:26,281
Lure a girl away from a guy
she loves with things.

759
00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:31,603
It won't work, and I'm dame enough to
be glad of it. What do you think of that?

760
00:55:31,769 --> 00:55:35,125
I had the same problem with her
grandmother. I mean, her mother.

761
00:55:35,409 --> 00:55:37,639
Whose mother?

762
00:55:39,529 --> 00:55:41,679
Nobody's, believe me.

763
00:55:41,849 --> 00:55:44,841
But it can be done.
I want that child on Broadway.

764
00:55:45,129 --> 00:55:46,881
Everything's set and ready to go.

765
00:55:47,049 --> 00:55:51,042
- Frame's built, and no face to go in it.
- You'll have the face. Let me work on it.

766
00:55:51,209 --> 00:55:53,165
Gladly, only work fast, will you? L...

767
00:55:53,329 --> 00:55:56,878
Immediately. Tomorrow night, in fact.
Keep the evening open.

768
00:55:57,049 --> 00:56:00,724
Enter the mastermind.

769
00:56:02,449 --> 00:56:05,247
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

770
00:56:11,329 --> 00:56:15,641
All is clear, master.
You may bring forth the treasure.

771
00:56:18,049 --> 00:56:22,088
No photographers, no adoring public.
Zounds, princess, you are slipping.

772
00:56:22,249 --> 00:56:26,083
- Listen to what I'm saying.
- You said Mr. Coudair was sentimental.

773
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:29,161
I said he can be sentimental
on his own time. Then what?

774
00:56:29,329 --> 00:56:31,445
Look.

775
00:56:32,449 --> 00:56:34,599
- Genius, explain it to him.
- Mr. McGuire...

776
00:56:34,769 --> 00:56:39,604
You don't need to explain. You want
to skip the show and go to a party.

777
00:56:39,769 --> 00:56:40,758
The second show.

778
00:56:40,929 --> 00:56:43,602
It's an anniversary dinner
at Mr. Coudair's house.

779
00:56:43,769 --> 00:56:46,966
- Imagine, eating in a house.
- It's <i>Vanity</i>'s 50th birthday.

780
00:56:47,129 --> 00:56:49,563
Why waste good food
on an old hag like that?

781
00:56:49,729 --> 00:56:51,606
Will you please stop clowning?

782
00:56:51,769 --> 00:56:54,363
I'm the Golden Wedding Girl,
so he wants me there.

783
00:56:54,529 --> 00:56:58,158
And because you work
at Danny McGuire's, I want you there.

784
00:56:58,329 --> 00:57:00,285
Do you only think of what you want?

785
00:57:00,449 --> 00:57:02,758
Mr. Coudair has the right
to want something.

786
00:57:02,929 --> 00:57:06,922
Once won't hurt. The guy's sentimental.
It can't happen again for 50 years.

787
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:10,286
You think he'd be sentimental
if she worked in Wheaton's show?

788
00:57:10,449 --> 00:57:12,883
He wouldn't. Why should he
kick our show around...

789
00:57:13,049 --> 00:57:16,166
...because it's Brooklyn?
- It's not kicking your show around...

790
00:57:16,329 --> 00:57:20,641
...that he's brought you more business
because of me than you've had before!

791
00:57:22,249 --> 00:57:24,205
I wondered when that was coming.

792
00:57:24,369 --> 00:57:28,647
That's what the ads read. " Come to
Danny McGuire's to see Rusty Parker."

793
00:57:28,809 --> 00:57:31,687
All the more reason you should
be there when they come.

794
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:36,684
I'll be there, Danny, for the first show.
But after the first show, I'm leaving.

795
00:57:36,849 --> 00:57:39,841
And you can get mad if you want to.

796
00:57:42,529 --> 00:57:44,884
Oh, she's a great kid, always clowning.

797
00:57:45,049 --> 00:57:47,358
You don't think she'd really do that,
do you?

798
00:57:47,529 --> 00:57:49,247
Great sense of humour, that kid.

799
00:58:00,249 --> 00:58:04,367
Peace, it's wonderful.
What quieted all of you down?

800
00:58:07,249 --> 00:58:09,843
- Where's Rusty?
- She went to a party.

801
00:58:10,129 --> 00:58:12,245
You should've seen how swell
she looked.

802
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:16,920
Just one word from you, and she does
what she likes, doesn't she, boss?

803
00:58:17,089 --> 00:58:18,966
- On stage.
- Just the six of us?

804
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:21,040
Space it a little. You can cover it.

805
00:58:21,209 --> 00:58:23,165
We will, Danny.

806
00:58:26,529 --> 00:58:28,565
Yeah, great sense of humour, that kid.

807
00:58:28,729 --> 00:58:31,448
You know, Danny, the funniest thing
just happened.

808
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:35,284
Coudair's more sentimental than
anybody I heard of. Did you know that?

809
00:58:35,449 --> 00:58:37,963
- Touching.
- He's even sentimental about us.

810
00:58:38,129 --> 00:58:41,963
Yeah, he just phoned. He wants you
to come to the party to pick Rusty up.

811
00:58:42,129 --> 00:58:45,678
Imagine that. A guy like him who's
got a barrelful of rubies...

812
00:58:45,849 --> 00:58:47,885
...and he's sentimental about a pearl.

813
00:58:48,049 --> 00:58:50,768
I guess he thinks it'd be nice
if we were friends.

814
00:58:50,929 --> 00:58:54,888
You have a great brain. Sometimes
it almost frightens me, you're so bright.

815
00:58:55,049 --> 00:58:57,882
You know, sometimes
it almost frightens me too.

816
00:58:58,049 --> 00:59:00,768
But you're going to the party,
aren't you, Danny?

817
00:59:00,929 --> 00:59:02,920
Sure.

818
00:59:03,449 --> 00:59:05,917
Sure, I'm going.

819
00:59:06,329 --> 00:59:08,638
I love parties.

820
00:59:18,649 --> 00:59:22,483
Here's the church, there's the steeple.
Open the door, and where's the people?

821
00:59:22,649 --> 00:59:23,684
I beg your pardon.

822
00:59:23,849 --> 00:59:26,488
Oh, a nursery rhyme.
I beg your pardon.

823
00:59:26,649 --> 00:59:28,765
Yes, sir. Will you come into the study?

824
00:59:28,929 --> 00:59:31,921
Mr. Coudair asked
that you be brought right in.

825
00:59:34,849 --> 00:59:38,524
- Nice to see you, Mr. McGuire.
- Nice to see you too, Mr. Coudair.

826
00:59:38,729 --> 00:59:40,367
I guess I'm a little mixed- up.

827
00:59:40,529 --> 00:59:42,679
Your message said Rusty'd be here.

828
00:59:42,849 --> 00:59:46,478
Yes, well, we changed plans
at the last minute, and we've...

829
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:48,560
Won't you sit down and have a drink?

830
00:59:48,729 --> 00:59:50,720
Thanks.

831
00:59:51,929 --> 00:59:55,239
Where is Rusty, Mr. Coudair?

832
00:59:56,329 --> 00:59:58,365
I don't really know.

833
00:59:58,529 --> 01:00:02,841
She and Mr. Wheaton had some sort of
an evening figured out, I understand.

834
01:00:03,929 --> 01:00:06,887
This isn't the right direction
for Mr. Coudair's house.

835
01:00:07,049 --> 01:00:10,564
You're being kidnapped. You like it?

836
01:00:10,729 --> 01:00:13,368
You're not very complimentary.
You're not scared.

837
01:00:13,529 --> 01:00:16,680
What are you talking about?
Aren't we going to a party?

838
01:00:16,849 --> 01:00:21,161
Sure we are. But I just want to stop by
my theatre first for a couple of minutes.

839
01:00:21,329 --> 01:00:25,117
I have kind of a problem that I thought
maybe you could help me with.

840
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:26,688
All right?

841
01:00:26,849 --> 01:00:30,683
Why, I suppose so.

842
01:00:30,849 --> 01:00:34,364
But won't Mr. Coudair wonder
where we are?

843
01:00:34,529 --> 01:00:37,601
I don't think so. No.

844
01:00:38,329 --> 01:00:40,684
Beauty like hers demands things,
Mr. McGuire:

845
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:43,568
Luxury, gentle living, money.

846
01:00:43,729 --> 01:00:46,004
- I have these.
- Are you sure she wants them?

847
01:00:46,169 --> 01:00:48,080
What beautiful young girl doesn't?

848
01:00:48,249 --> 01:00:51,161
Have you given her the chance
to make up her own mind?

849
01:00:51,329 --> 01:00:53,524
Have you?

850
01:00:54,929 --> 01:00:58,478
That's fair enough.
Why don't we leave it up to her?

851
01:00:58,649 --> 01:01:00,879
She won't leave you.
She's in love with you.

852
01:01:01,049 --> 01:01:03,165
- I'm in love with her.
- I doubt that.

853
01:01:03,329 --> 01:01:06,366
If you were, you wouldn't let her
remain in obscurity.

854
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:10,647
Don't you think I'd make her go
if I thought she'd be happier with...?

855
01:01:11,329 --> 01:01:13,889
No, Mr. Coudair, I don't believe
she would be.

856
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:16,882
I don't believe it for a minute. L...

857
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,157
Beautiful, isn't she?

858
01:01:24,369 --> 01:01:25,643
Yes.

859
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:29,043
I've never seen that picture before.
Is it new?

860
01:01:29,529 --> 01:01:32,487
That is a picture of Rusty's
grandmother, Mr. McGuire.

861
01:01:32,649 --> 01:01:35,686
- I was very much in love with her.
- Well, I'll be darned.

862
01:01:35,849 --> 01:01:39,080
That's exactly what I said to myself
when I first saw Rusty.

863
01:01:39,249 --> 01:01:41,683
Amazing resemblance, isn't there?

864
01:01:41,849 --> 01:01:44,761
She was a dancer too,
worked at Tony Pastor's.

865
01:01:44,929 --> 01:01:46,408
Tony Pastor's, huh?

866
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:48,161
It was wrong for her...

867
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:51,082
...as Danny McGuire's is wrong
for her granddaughter.

868
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,080
You decided that right away, huh?

869
01:01:53,249 --> 01:01:55,285
Yes, so I asked her to marry me.

870
01:01:55,449 --> 01:01:57,565
Did she?

871
01:01:57,729 --> 01:02:00,038
Sit down, won't you?

872
01:02:00,729 --> 01:02:04,244
I'll never forget the day I asked her up
here to meet my mother.

873
01:02:04,529 --> 01:02:08,078
My mother was society,
and Maribelle a girl from the stage.

874
01:02:08,249 --> 01:02:11,685
Maribelle stood there with her chin up
and her knees shaking...

875
01:02:11,849 --> 01:02:15,080
...and Mother was looking
her over very thoroughly.

876
01:02:15,249 --> 01:02:20,118
Mother just shook her head
and said, "Poor John."

877
01:02:20,849 --> 01:02:24,205
I don't suppose you remember
a song called "Poor John."

878
01:02:24,369 --> 01:02:25,882
That's how she punished me...

879
01:02:26,049 --> 01:02:30,486
...by singing it until everyone
in New York knew that I was "Poor John."

880
01:02:30,649 --> 01:02:32,002
Let me tell you about one night.

881
01:02:51,009 --> 01:02:54,046
<i>I ought to think myself a lucky girl</i>

882
01:02:54,209 --> 01:02:55,847
<i>I know</i>

883
01:02:56,009 --> 01:02:58,887
<i>'Cause I'm engaged</i>
<i>But still somehow</i>

884
01:02:59,049 --> 01:03:01,961
<i>I don't think so</i>

885
01:03:02,129 --> 01:03:06,566
<i>John, that's the name of my finance</i>
<i>You see</i>

886
01:03:06,729 --> 01:03:08,720
<i>There's no mistak e</i>

887
01:03:08,889 --> 01:03:12,325
<i>He's very fond of me</i>

888
01:03:12,969 --> 01:03:17,884
<i>He took me out for walks</i>
<i>And, oh, he was so nice</i>

889
01:03:18,049 --> 01:03:21,007
<i>He always used to kiss me</i>

890
01:03:21,169 --> 01:03:24,844
<i>On the same place twice</i>

891
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:30,481
<i>Often in the park</i>
<i>We would sit and spoon</i>

892
01:03:30,649 --> 01:03:33,561
<i>And I was, oh, so happy</i>

893
01:03:33,729 --> 01:03:39,326
<i>Till the other afternoon</i>

894
01:03:40,609 --> 01:03:45,364
<i>John took me round to see his mother</i>

895
01:03:45,529 --> 01:03:50,284
<i>His mother</i>
<i>His mother</i>

896
01:03:50,449 --> 01:03:54,522
<i>And when he introduced us</i>
<i>To each other</i>

897
01:03:54,689 --> 01:03:59,046
<i>She weighed up everything that I had on</i>

898
01:03:59,209 --> 01:04:04,078
<i>She put me through a cross-examination</i>

899
01:04:04,249 --> 01:04:08,879
<i>I fairly boiled with aggravation</i>

900
01:04:09,049 --> 01:04:11,324
<i>Then she shook her head</i>

901
01:04:11,489 --> 01:04:14,128
<i>Look ed at me and said:</i>

902
01:04:14,289 --> 01:04:19,886
<i>"Poor John, poor John"</i>

903
01:04:27,289 --> 01:04:30,565
<i>His mother</i>

904
01:04:39,089 --> 01:04:43,719
<i>She put me through a cross-examination</i>

905
01:04:43,889 --> 01:04:48,326
<i>I fairly boiled with aggravation</i>

906
01:04:48,489 --> 01:04:50,605
<i>Then she shook her head</i>

907
01:04:50,769 --> 01:04:52,487
<i>Look ed at me and said:</i>

908
01:04:52,649 --> 01:04:57,484
<i>"Poor John, poor John"</i>

909
01:04:57,649 --> 01:05:00,721
<i>John took you around to see his mother</i>

910
01:05:00,889 --> 01:05:04,325
<i>His mother</i>
<i>His mother</i>

911
01:05:04,489 --> 01:05:07,686
<i>And when he introduced them</i>
<i>To each other</i>

912
01:05:07,849 --> 01:05:11,159
<i>She weighed up everything that I had on</i>

913
01:05:11,329 --> 01:05:14,719
<i>She put her through a cross-examination</i>

914
01:05:14,889 --> 01:05:18,245
<i>I fairly boiled with aggravation</i>

915
01:05:18,409 --> 01:05:19,842
<i>Then she shook her head</i>

916
01:05:20,009 --> 01:05:21,328
<i>And look ed at her and said:</i>

917
01:05:21,489 --> 01:05:25,448
<i>"Poor John, poor John"</i>

918
01:05:35,689 --> 01:05:39,045
<i>She weighed up everything that I had on</i>

919
01:05:39,209 --> 01:05:42,645
<i>She put her through a cross-examination</i>

920
01:05:42,809 --> 01:05:47,280
<i>I fairly boiled with aggravation</i>

921
01:05:53,889 --> 01:05:56,039
<i>Then she shook her head</i>

922
01:05:56,209 --> 01:05:57,437
<i>Look ed at me and said:</i>

923
01:05:57,609 --> 01:06:01,921
<i>"Poor John, poor John"</i>

924
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:08,562
Hello, Maribelle.

925
01:06:08,729 --> 01:06:10,720
Hello.

926
01:06:13,649 --> 01:06:16,083
I wish you weren't upset
about the way Mother...

927
01:06:16,249 --> 01:06:19,082
- She's lived a sort of conventional life.
- Upset?

928
01:06:19,249 --> 01:06:21,888
Why, I'm delighted.
Mr. Pastor's delighted.

929
01:06:22,049 --> 01:06:24,882
The piano player's delighted.
Everybody's delighted.

930
01:06:25,049 --> 01:06:27,165
We think your mother's very intelligent.

931
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:28,644
Listen, Maribelle, l...

932
01:06:29,009 --> 01:06:32,763
A very intelligent woman. Why, she
knows I don't belong on Fifth Avenue.

933
01:06:32,929 --> 01:06:37,525
She knows I belong right here. And now
I do too, not that I didn't know it before.

934
01:06:37,729 --> 01:06:40,562
I don't believe it.
I didn't before and still don't.

935
01:06:41,049 --> 01:06:44,485
Oh, John, dear, we've been through
all this before.

936
01:06:44,649 --> 01:06:47,880
But I didn't quite know
how right I was until...

937
01:06:48,049 --> 01:06:51,564
I was very uncomfortable
in that pile of rock you call a house.

938
01:06:51,849 --> 01:06:53,487
That was because of Mother.

939
01:06:53,649 --> 01:06:55,605
From now on, Mother doesn't exist.

940
01:06:55,769 --> 01:06:59,444
Nothing exists that can come
between you and me, do you hear? I...

941
01:07:01,529 --> 01:07:03,645
What's that?

942
01:07:03,849 --> 01:07:05,521
That's him.

943
01:07:11,729 --> 01:07:13,959
He's hard to keep out, isn't he?

944
01:07:14,129 --> 01:07:15,482
Maribelle, listen to me.

945
01:07:15,649 --> 01:07:18,641
I know what he has to offer.
I know what this has to offer.

946
01:07:18,809 --> 01:07:21,687
It's nothing to what I can give you.
He loves you.

947
01:07:21,849 --> 01:07:26,479
But not the way I do. Forty years from
now I'll love you more then I do now.

948
01:07:26,689 --> 01:07:28,964
What you have now,
you can have a million times.

949
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:32,565
All the things you tell me
are important: Love, fun, music.

950
01:07:32,729 --> 01:07:35,482
If you marry me, you'll have
all of them. I promise.

951
01:07:35,649 --> 01:07:38,038
The very best that money can buy.

952
01:07:38,529 --> 01:07:40,963
Now do you understand
my interest in Rusty?

953
01:07:41,129 --> 01:07:47,159
It's like my youth has come back after
having been away a long, long time.

954
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:49,684
Who was playing the piano?

955
01:07:49,849 --> 01:07:52,682
A very ordinary, young fellow
who worked there.

956
01:07:52,849 --> 01:07:53,964
In love with her.

957
01:07:54,129 --> 01:07:57,360
What difference does that make?
He had nothing to offer her.

958
01:07:57,529 --> 01:07:58,678
Like me.

959
01:07:58,849 --> 01:08:01,044
If you like.

960
01:08:02,249 --> 01:08:05,480
Thanks for a very interesting evening,
Mr. Coudair.

961
01:08:05,649 --> 01:08:09,688
But it's after 1:00, and Rusty'll
be waiting at a place we know.

962
01:08:09,849 --> 01:08:12,317
I wouldn't be too sure about that,
Mr. McGuire.

963
01:08:12,529 --> 01:08:16,681
At the risk of repeating myself,
Rusty wants what we have to give her.

964
01:08:16,849 --> 01:08:20,398
Good night, Mr. Coudair.

965
01:08:30,529 --> 01:08:32,918
It certainly is big, isn't it?

966
01:08:33,089 --> 01:08:35,887
You ought to see it when it's filled
with 2000 people.

967
01:08:36,089 --> 01:08:38,478
Two thousand?

968
01:08:38,649 --> 01:08:42,278
And look at the orchestra.
We only have six in ours.

969
01:08:42,449 --> 01:08:44,360
What do you do with so much room?

970
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:48,488
Watching you at McGuire's, I'm amazed
how well you handle the space.

971
01:08:48,649 --> 01:08:50,958
I'd think you'd be knocking
each other down.

972
01:08:51,129 --> 01:08:54,405
Sometimes we do wish we had
a stage as big as this one.

973
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:57,720
This stage is yours
for the asking, Rusty.

974
01:08:59,849 --> 01:09:03,159
My goodness, it must be at least
a half a mile wide.

975
01:09:03,929 --> 01:09:06,284
Did you ever dance on a stage
as big as this?

976
01:09:06,449 --> 01:09:10,886
It's more like flying than dancing,
the freedom of it.

977
01:09:11,049 --> 01:09:16,726
Close your eyes. Go on, close
your eyes just to get the feel of it.

978
01:10:00,449 --> 01:10:03,521
Looks like she's not coming,
huh, Danny?

979
01:10:04,049 --> 01:10:06,847
Maybe she forgot it was Friday.

980
01:10:16,649 --> 01:10:20,528
Hey, don't be a schlemoil.

981
01:10:22,729 --> 01:10:25,323
Schlemiel.

982
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:39,085
<i>Beauty lik e Rusty's demands</i>
<i>things, huh?</i>

983
01:10:39,249 --> 01:10:43,527
<i>She loves me. I love her,</i>
<i>and that's all two people need.</i>

984
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:48,647
<i>Then why didn't she meet you</i>
<i>at the oyster bar tonight?</i>

985
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:54,163
<i>Something happened.</i>
<i>She'll explain it tomorrow.</i>

986
01:10:54,329 --> 01:10:57,719
<i>Wait a minute, Danny McGuire!</i>

987
01:10:58,129 --> 01:11:00,563
<i>She stood you up, and you know it.</i>

988
01:11:00,729 --> 01:11:03,289
<i>She's out with Wheaton,</i>
<i>and you know that too.</i>

989
01:11:03,449 --> 01:11:06,566
<i>So she's out with Wheaton.</i>
<i>What difference does it mak e?</i>

990
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:08,765
<i>Danny!</i>

991
01:11:11,129 --> 01:11:14,360
Don't be such a hardheaded Irishman
for once.

992
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:17,118
If you really loved Rusty,
you'd let her go.

993
01:11:19,369 --> 01:11:23,362
Coudair's right. You have nothing
to give her. Wheaton has everything.

994
01:11:23,729 --> 01:11:25,879
Hey!

995
01:11:26,049 --> 01:11:28,438
Danny!

996
01:11:28,689 --> 01:11:31,362
You can't run away from yourself.

997
01:11:31,529 --> 01:11:36,045
You gotta make up your mind,
and I'm gonna see that you do it now.

998
01:11:37,249 --> 01:11:39,922
Wait a minute! Stop!

999
01:14:17,929 --> 01:14:19,157
Hi, Lucy! Am I late?

1000
01:14:19,329 --> 01:14:22,048
Can't you see for yourself?

1001
01:14:22,529 --> 01:14:25,521
<i>I dreamed a dream one day</i>

1002
01:14:25,689 --> 01:14:32,162
<i>And now that dream is here beside me</i>
<i>Long...</i>

1003
01:14:32,329 --> 01:14:33,762
Danny!

1004
01:14:33,929 --> 01:14:35,760
Hello, Rusty!

1005
01:14:35,929 --> 01:14:36,964
Yeah?

1006
01:14:38,129 --> 01:14:40,165
What's Maurine doing
singing my number?

1007
01:14:40,529 --> 01:14:45,284
She was here. Maurine, go to the piano
and get up on the second A. You're flat.

1008
01:14:45,449 --> 01:14:47,326
Okay, Danny.

1009
01:14:48,249 --> 01:14:50,001
But you knew I was coming.

1010
01:14:50,449 --> 01:14:54,727
Did I? It's a quarter of 11.
Rehearsals are called for 10.

1011
01:14:56,449 --> 01:14:59,919
Is 45 minutes something
to make a crisis about?

1012
01:15:00,129 --> 01:15:03,758
Kind of an amazing thing
happened last night, Danny.

1013
01:15:03,929 --> 01:15:07,080
It's no use my trying
to explain it to you...

1014
01:15:07,249 --> 01:15:10,924
...because I can't explain it to me.

1015
01:15:11,329 --> 01:15:14,082
I don't suppose you understand
what I mean, do you?

1016
01:15:14,569 --> 01:15:16,878
Sure we do. It's very clear,
isn't it, Danny?

1017
01:15:17,089 --> 01:15:19,967
Do you mind if I take care of this
my way for a change?

1018
01:15:20,129 --> 01:15:22,359
I don't know why
you're making a big deal...

1019
01:15:22,529 --> 01:15:25,566
You've met so many people,
you forgot what I look like.

1020
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:27,481
I'm the man with the whip.

1021
01:15:27,649 --> 01:15:32,564
I'm the guy who's got a swell place
that means more to me than anything...

1022
01:15:32,729 --> 01:15:34,287
...or anybody.

1023
01:15:34,449 --> 01:15:37,486
If you're late, Maurine goes in.
She should get up in it...

1024
01:15:37,649 --> 01:15:40,686
...because it looks like
she'll end up doing it.

1025
01:15:40,849 --> 01:15:44,285
You see, to Maurine,
this place comes first.

1026
01:15:44,449 --> 01:15:47,441
You've hated it ever since
I got to be a cover girl.

1027
01:15:47,649 --> 01:15:49,002
You want to be the big shot.

1028
01:15:49,169 --> 01:15:53,162
There isn't any room
in Danny McGuire's for any big shot.

1029
01:15:53,329 --> 01:15:56,878
Well, if you don't want me here,
why don't you say so?

1030
01:15:57,049 --> 01:16:01,406
If I'm messing up your precious
little place, why don't you say so?

1031
01:16:01,569 --> 01:16:04,037
I've got someplace to go.
I'm not dependent on...

1032
01:16:04,329 --> 01:16:05,557
Why don't you go then?

1033
01:16:14,449 --> 01:16:16,724
Okay.

1034
01:16:24,049 --> 01:16:29,328
I'm certainly glad I found out you felt
this way, Danny, before it was too late.

1035
01:16:29,489 --> 01:16:32,049
- You bet I'll go. I've got...
- I know. You told me.

1036
01:16:33,249 --> 01:16:35,888
So if you wanna see me again,
Danny McGuire...

1037
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:38,563
...you can just come to Broadway...

1038
01:16:38,729 --> 01:16:41,846
...to a big show!

1039
01:16:42,649 --> 01:16:46,722
Why don't you cut off your arms
and legs and do a good job of it?

1040
01:17:01,489 --> 01:17:04,561
<i>Soldiers and civilians</i>
<i>People by the millions</i>

1041
01:17:04,729 --> 01:17:07,766
<i>Want to see the perfect cover girl</i>

1042
01:17:07,929 --> 01:17:10,682
<i>So I've tak en</i>
<i>Lots of candid-camera shots</i>

<i>Of beauty</i>
<i>My duty</i>

1044
01:17:13,849 --> 01:17:17,159
<i>There's nothing lik e perfection</i>
<i>So in that connection</i>

1045
01:17:17,329 --> 01:17:20,321
<i>I present my perfect cover girl</i>

1046
01:17:20,489 --> 01:17:21,717
<i>Number one I list her</i>

1047
01:17:21,889 --> 01:17:27,919
<i>How can I resist her?</i>

1048
01:17:28,089 --> 01:17:30,922
<i>I've seen the one I go for</i>

1049
01:17:31,089 --> 01:17:34,081
<i>One I've look ed high and low for</i>

1050
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:36,843

1051

<i>She k eeps electrifying me</i>

1054
01:17:48,449 --> 01:17:52,362
<i>But is she fancy-free?</i>

1055
01:17:53,689 --> 01:17:54,804
<i>We'd mak e a team</i>

1056
01:17:54,969 --> 01:17:56,687

1057
01:17:56,849 --> 01:17:59,727
<i>With love that's everlasting</i>

1058
01:18:01,049 --> 01:18:02,926
<i>It wouldn't be extreme</i>

01:18:03,129 --> 01:18:06,405
<i>To call us perfect casting</i>

1060
01:18:06,569 --> 01:18:09,845
<i>Love, help a helpless lover</i>

1061
01:18:11,169 --> 01:18:14,241
<i>Love, come and help uncover that girl</i>

1062
01:18:14,409 --> 01:18:17,321
<i>On the cover for me</i>

1063
01:20:51,769 --> 01:20:54,647
<i>I've seen the one I go for</i>

1064
01:20:54,809 --> 01:20:57,607
<i>One I've look ed high and low for</i>

1065
01:20:57,769 --> 01:21:00,442
<i>Life's not complete</i>

1066
01:21:00,609 --> 01:21:03,999
<i>Till I meet that girl on the cover</i>

1067
01:21:04,169 --> 01:21:07,320
<i>My problem has me sighing</i>

1068
01:21:07,489 --> 01:21:11,767
<i>She k eeps electrifying me</i>

1069
01:21:11,929 --> 01:21:15,604
<i>But is she fancy-free?</i>

1070
01:21:15,769 --> 01:21:19,842
<i>We'd mak e a team</i>
<i>That could be supreme</i>

1071
01:21:20,009 --> 01:21:23,126
<i>With love that's everlasting</i>

1072
01:21:23,489 --> 01:21:26,481
<i>It wouldn't be extreme</i>

1073
01:21:26,649 --> 01:21:29,686
<i>To call us perfect casting</i>

1074
01:21:29,849 --> 01:21:32,602
<i>Love, help a helpless lover</i>

1075
01:21:32,769 --> 01:21:36,728
<i>Love, come and help uncover that girl</i>

1076
01:21:36,889 --> 01:21:41,519
<i>On the cover for me</i>

1077
01:22:18,569 --> 01:22:21,686
<i>I've seen the one I go for</i>

1078
01:22:21,849 --> 01:22:25,285
<i>One I've look ed high and low for</i>

1079
01:22:25,449 --> 01:22:28,282
<i>Life's not complete</i>

1080
01:22:28,449 --> 01:22:37,562
<i>Till I meet that girl on the cover</i>

1081
01:22:44,969 --> 01:22:48,166
- Fun tonight, beautiful?
- Lots of fun. It always is.

1082
01:22:48,329 --> 01:22:50,399
Glad we ditched
Jackson and Mr. Coudair?

1083
01:22:50,569 --> 01:22:51,558
I like them.

1084
01:22:51,729 --> 01:22:54,004
You can like somebody
and not want to live with them.

1085
01:22:54,209 --> 01:22:55,688
- Yes.
- You can't love someone...

1086
01:22:55,849 --> 01:22:58,568
...and not want to.
- No.

1087
01:22:58,729 --> 01:23:00,845
Can you?

1088
01:23:04,449 --> 01:23:06,644
No.

1089
01:23:07,329 --> 01:23:10,685
Do you know I've never asked
anybody to marry me?

1090
01:23:10,849 --> 01:23:12,362
You've missed half your life.

1091
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:14,679
The first half.

1092
01:23:14,849 --> 01:23:18,239
I wouldn't like to miss
the second half too, Rusty.

1093
01:23:18,849 --> 01:23:22,888
Oh, I'm home! I'm always so surprised
when I get home so quick.

1094
01:23:23,049 --> 01:23:26,519
When I lived in Brooklyn it took...

1095
01:23:28,449 --> 01:23:30,280
Okay.

1096
01:23:30,449 --> 01:23:32,883
I'm in love with you, Rusty.

1097
01:23:33,049 --> 01:23:35,961
But that's no surprise to you, is it?

1098
01:23:36,129 --> 01:23:37,960
Not exactly.

1099
01:23:38,129 --> 01:23:40,359
I want to marry you.

1100
01:23:40,729 --> 01:23:42,685
That's a surprise, isn't it?

1101
01:23:43,329 --> 01:23:46,480
I never thought of you
as a family man, exactly.

1102
01:23:46,649 --> 01:23:48,241
Oh, good heavens, I'm not.

1103
01:23:48,409 --> 01:23:49,762
But...

1104
01:23:50,849 --> 01:23:54,125
...I don't suppose you're in love
with me at all, are you?

1105
01:23:54,409 --> 01:23:58,607
I think you're one of the swellest persons
I've ever known.

1106
01:24:02,489 --> 01:24:05,765
There's no emotional hangover,
is there, Rusty?

1107
01:24:06,289 --> 01:24:09,520
I mean, from Brooklyn?

1108
01:24:11,689 --> 01:24:13,327
Well, then?

1109
01:24:13,729 --> 01:24:16,527
Can I tell you tomorrow?

1110
01:24:17,689 --> 01:24:20,362
Okay, beautiful.

1111
01:24:20,849 --> 01:24:24,046
If you don't care
that I'll age 10 years tonight.

1112
01:24:24,209 --> 01:24:27,645
You should be a very distinguished- 
looking man 10 years from now.

1113
01:24:27,809 --> 01:24:29,845
I might even like you better.

1114
01:24:31,289 --> 01:24:33,200
I'll tell you tomorrow.

1115
01:24:33,769 --> 01:24:35,600
That's all, brother.

1116
01:24:41,649 --> 01:24:44,243
This is where you live, beautiful.
Not me.

1117
01:24:46,329 --> 01:24:49,639
Lend me your car for a while?
I'll send it back.

1118
01:24:50,289 --> 01:24:51,688
Where are you going?

1119
01:24:54,609 --> 01:24:55,883
Brooklyn, James.

1120
01:24:56,289 --> 01:24:59,565
Cinderella wants to take
another peek at the ashes.

1121
01:25:50,049 --> 01:25:51,038
Hello, Pop.

1122
01:25:51,809 --> 01:25:53,606
Well, Rusty.

1123
01:25:54,049 --> 01:25:55,960
Thought I heard a noise down here...

1124
01:25:56,129 --> 01:26:00,008
...but I didn't know it was
that big noise, Rusty Parker.

1125
01:26:02,809 --> 01:26:04,686
How are things, Pop?

1126
01:26:06,129 --> 01:26:09,963
I imagine Danny's gotten along
all right without me, hasn't he?

1127
01:26:10,529 --> 01:26:12,201
He said he could.

1128
01:26:13,969 --> 01:26:17,120
- Has he?
- I wouldn't know.

1129
01:26:17,289 --> 01:26:19,849
He closed the place up
and went away...

1130
01:26:20,009 --> 01:26:22,159
...right after you left.

1131
01:26:24,329 --> 01:26:25,318
Where is he?

1132
01:26:25,769 --> 01:26:28,761
Him and Genius is entertaining
at Army camps.

1133
01:26:31,169 --> 01:26:32,887
I see.

1134
01:26:36,329 --> 01:26:39,526
Well, you needn't look at me
like I'd done something.

1135
01:26:39,689 --> 01:26:42,203
He closed the place down,
I didn't.

1136
01:26:42,609 --> 01:26:43,803
Didn't you?

1137
01:27:08,289 --> 01:27:10,086
Give me a drink.

1138
01:27:10,489 --> 01:27:13,287
- You've had too many now.
- So I've had too many.

1139
01:27:13,449 --> 01:27:16,247
- Give me another one.
- Lf you say so.

1140
01:27:16,409 --> 01:27:18,604
Certainly I say so.

1141
01:27:20,529 --> 01:27:24,078
And I'm a very big noise,
don't you know that?

1142
01:27:24,249 --> 01:27:26,319
You've got to run when I say so.

1143
01:27:26,929 --> 01:27:30,968
- The toast of the town, huh, Rusty?
- That's right.

1144
01:27:33,969 --> 01:27:37,245
But to you, I'm only a crumb,
is that it, Joe?

1145
01:27:37,409 --> 01:27:40,048
Go ahead, say it.

1146
01:27:40,449 --> 01:27:43,885
You're thinking it.
What's the difference?

1147
01:27:48,129 --> 01:27:49,528
You're thinking it.

1148
01:27:53,369 --> 01:27:56,042
You're a friend of Danny's, aren't you?

1149
01:27:56,929 --> 01:28:01,207
Then he told you why
he went away, didn't he?

1150
01:28:02,209 --> 01:28:05,087
To entertain at Army camps.

1151
01:28:06,289 --> 01:28:08,166
Don't let that fool you.

1152
01:28:08,329 --> 01:28:10,559
He was sick of Brooklyn.

1153
01:28:12,369 --> 01:28:15,008
Well, who isn't?

1154
01:28:15,169 --> 01:28:18,047
Rusty! Darling, we've looked
all over the place for you.

1155
01:28:18,209 --> 01:28:20,359
Oh, hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

1156
01:28:20,529 --> 01:28:23,487
Sit down. Sit down. Right here.

1157
01:28:23,729 --> 01:28:26,880
These stools are res<i>erve</i>d
for my friends.

1158
01:28:27,049 --> 01:28:29,483
- Joe, these are my friends.
- Hello, Joe.

1159
01:28:29,649 --> 01:28:32,368
My friends are sick of Brooklyn too.

1160
01:28:32,729 --> 01:28:34,640
Aren't you sick of Brooklyn?

1161
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:37,243
Noel got worried
when you didn't send the car back.

1162
01:28:37,409 --> 01:28:38,762
I was scared to death.

1163
01:28:38,929 --> 01:28:42,604
I asked John to help me find you.
I didn't know my way around.

1164
01:28:42,769 --> 01:28:46,159
Joe, give my friends a drink.
Have a drink.

1165
01:28:47,329 --> 01:28:49,889
I was afraid something
might have happened to you.

1166
01:28:50,049 --> 01:28:52,768
Or that you had decided
to stay in Brooklyn.

1167
01:28:54,769 --> 01:28:56,088
Me?

1168
01:28:56,249 --> 01:28:58,001
Stay in Brooklyn?

1169
01:29:01,809 --> 01:29:04,687
Why do you think I'd stay in Brooklyn?

1170
01:29:04,849 --> 01:29:07,238
After all I went through
to get out of it.

1171
01:29:07,409 --> 01:29:11,766
For heaven's sakes, what do you
think I am, a vicious circle?

1172
01:29:11,929 --> 01:29:13,806
Where's your drink?

1173
01:29:13,969 --> 01:29:17,678
Joe, did you know
I was going to get married?

1174
01:29:18,209 --> 01:29:19,483
Did you?

1175
01:29:19,649 --> 01:29:21,207
Did you?

1176
01:29:22,049 --> 01:29:24,279
Well, I am.

1177
01:29:25,969 --> 01:29:27,288
- To you.
- Rusty...

1178
01:29:27,449 --> 01:29:28,723
Certainly.

1179
01:29:28,889 --> 01:29:32,120
This is what I've wanted for me
all my life.

1180
01:29:33,129 --> 01:29:34,960
Isn't it?

1181
01:29:36,609 --> 01:29:38,361
Well...

1182
01:29:39,889 --> 01:29:41,766
...l've got it.

1183
01:29:49,449 --> 01:29:52,725
- Pay the man.
- Wait a minute, beautiful.

1184
01:29:53,849 --> 01:29:57,000
That's the first drink
I ever seen that kid take.

1185
01:29:57,169 --> 01:30:00,878
You must have made her
awfully happy up there, mister.

1186
01:30:10,609 --> 01:30:12,679
That's why I say,
do you need money?

1187
01:30:12,849 --> 01:30:15,966
See your local finance company.
No questions. No call-makers.

1188
01:30:16,129 --> 01:30:18,927
Just leave your eyeball for security.

1189
01:30:19,089 --> 01:30:22,126
Now, radio station GI presents
a truck-to-truck hookup...

1190
01:30:22,289 --> 01:30:26,441
...featuring Red Herring and his
gee- but-they're- grand glee club.

1197
01:31:13,449 --> 01:31:15,405

- Jazz.

1198

<i>I'll climb the highest mountain</i>
<i>I'll swim the smallest fountain for you</i>

1214
01:32:25,049 --> 01:32:27,927
<i>To the test</i>

1215
01:32:28,089 --> 01:32:31,206
<i>- Boy</i>
<i>- Mak e your request</i>

1216
01:32:31,369 --> 01:32:34,725
<i>- Hawaiian poi, boy</i>
<i>- I'll go to the Sahara</i>

1217
01:32:34,889 --> 01:32:36,766
<i>I'll get a queen's tiara</i>

1218
01:32:39,289 --> 01:32:43,168
<i>Oh, murder!</i>
<i>Solid! Jackson! Zoot!</i>

1219
01:32:46,249 --> 01:32:48,638
<i>First I promise you</i>
<i>I'll climb the highest mountain</i>

1220
01:32:48,809 --> 01:32:51,164
<i>Then for you I'll swim</i>
<i>The Radio City fountain</i>

1221
01:32:51,329 --> 01:32:53,718
<i>Though I'm scared of height</i>
<i>And I can't even float</i>

1222
01:32:53,889 --> 01:32:56,164
<i>Just put me to the test</i>
<i>And here's what else I'll do quote</i>

1223
01:32:56,329 --> 01:32:59,002
<i>Get a snowball right from Popocatpetl</i>

1224
01:32:59,169 --> 01:33:01,478
<i>I'll be Hansel if you'll be my Gretel</i>

1225
01:33:01,649 --> 01:33:05,722
<i>If we can't please you</i>
<i>Then perhaps my clarinet'll</i>

1226
01:33:05,889 --> 01:33:09,006
<i>- Why don't you put me</i>
<i>- Why don't you put me to the test, babe</i>

1227
01:33:09,169 --> 01:33:11,808
<i>I'll do the rest, babe</i>
<i>Mak e your request, babe</i>

1228
01:33:11,969 --> 01:33:14,403
<i>Anything your heart desires</i>

1229
01:33:14,609 --> 01:33:16,884
<i>- An orange from Pomona</i>
<i>- A bronc from Arizona</i>

1230
01:33:17,049 --> 01:33:19,358
<i>- Or a Hansel and a Gretel</i>
<i>- Snow from Popocatpetl</i>

1231
01:33:19,529 --> 01:33:22,282
<i>- All of this?</i>
<i>- All of this is...</i>

1232
01:33:22,489 --> 01:33:25,208
<i>A mountain or a fountain</i>
<i>Or a solid murder, Jackson, or a...</i>

1233
01:33:27,209 --> 01:33:31,361
<i>Is yours</i>

1234
01:33:45,489 --> 01:33:48,003
Pardon me, may I have the next dance?

1235
01:33:48,169 --> 01:33:50,080
No, thanks.
I'm sitting this one out.

1236
01:33:50,249 --> 01:33:52,604
- Glad to see you.
- Glad to see you.

1237
01:33:53,369 --> 01:33:55,041
What are you trying to do, you...?

1238
01:33:55,209 --> 01:33:56,961
- Lady present.
- Lady?

1239
01:33:57,529 --> 01:33:59,281
- Ladies?
- Where?

1240
01:33:59,449 --> 01:34:02,088
- Where's the lady?
- There she is. Over there.

1241
01:34:03,129 --> 01:34:05,006
Oh, there she is again.

1242
01:34:05,169 --> 01:34:08,047
Relax. You ain't even
in her world, sad sack.

1243
01:34:08,209 --> 01:34:10,882
- I can dream, can't I?
- Wake up. She's getting married.

1244
01:34:11,049 --> 01:34:12,960
I read it in the paper.

1245
01:34:20,169 --> 01:34:21,488
Enter, my lord. Enter.

1246
01:34:21,649 --> 01:34:23,560
What have we here?
A tavern?

1247
01:34:23,729 --> 01:34:25,640
A likely place, my lord.
A likely place.

1248
01:34:25,809 --> 01:34:29,802
- I'll wager the coffee is rancid.
- True, my lord. True.

1249
01:34:29,969 --> 01:34:30,958
Joe, how are you?

1250
01:34:31,129 --> 01:34:33,927
Am I glad to see you birds.
Where you been anyway?

1251
01:34:34,089 --> 01:34:36,080
Military secret.

1252
01:34:37,289 --> 01:34:39,519
- The boys look pretty good?
- Plenty good.

1253
01:34:39,689 --> 01:34:43,238
Look at them, and you won't worry about
who'll be boss over there.

1254
01:34:43,409 --> 01:34:45,286
- Well, give out.
- What'll you have?

1255
01:34:45,449 --> 01:34:48,282
Oysters!
What do we generally have?

1256
01:34:48,449 --> 01:34:50,121
Just the two of you?

1257
01:34:51,809 --> 01:34:54,164
Did you bring anyone with you, Genius?

1258
01:34:55,089 --> 01:34:56,363
No.

1259
01:34:56,849 --> 01:34:58,567
Oysters!

1260
01:34:58,769 --> 01:34:59,758
Good old Joe.

1261
01:34:59,929 --> 01:35:03,524
He's bald. He's fat. He says "pearls."
He says "oysters." I love him.

1262
01:35:03,689 --> 01:35:05,247
You know? I love him too.

1263
01:35:05,409 --> 01:35:06,398
- You know why?
- Why?

1264
01:35:06,569 --> 01:35:08,207
Because he's dumber than me.

1265
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:11,361
- Dumber than I.
- Okay. He's dumber than both of us.

1266
01:35:11,529 --> 01:35:13,042
Here we are.

1267
01:35:13,289 --> 01:35:15,405
Well, Joe, here we go again.

1268
01:35:18,689 --> 01:35:20,759
You wanna kill the magic?

1269
01:35:22,409 --> 01:35:25,048
Come on, pearl.

1270
01:35:28,089 --> 01:35:30,649
Well, Joe, what do you hear
about anybody?

1271
01:35:30,809 --> 01:35:32,800
Rusty, Danny?

1272
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:37,197
Okay, what do you hear
about the little redhead?

1273
01:35:37,369 --> 01:35:40,884
- She's moved. You know where?
- And if I did...

1274
01:35:41,089 --> 01:35:42,488
...she's moving again.

1275
01:35:42,649 --> 01:35:45,641
She's getting married.
Tonight, Danny.

1276
01:35:49,489 --> 01:35:51,366
Tonight?

1277
01:35:53,329 --> 01:35:54,762
Hey, Danny, you found it.

1278
01:35:54,929 --> 01:35:58,604
- Found what?
- The pearl, Danny. You found the pearl!

1279
01:36:08,409 --> 01:36:10,764
- Nice timing.
- I told you it was a fake.

1280
01:36:12,649 --> 01:36:14,128
Sure you did.

1281
01:36:15,329 --> 01:36:18,719
- Give me a cup of coffee, will you, Joe?
- Right, Danny.

1282
01:36:30,209 --> 01:36:33,565
You see, I'm a genius at everything
but minding my own business.

1283
01:36:33,729 --> 01:36:37,278
Rusty ought to have that pearl
after looking for it for six months.

1284
01:36:37,449 --> 01:36:40,646
If she's gonna marry anybody but Danny,
she'll need all the luck she can get.

1285
01:36:40,809 --> 01:36:43,039
- McGuire know you came here?
- Oh, no.

1286
01:36:43,209 --> 01:36:45,643
He'd kick my teeth in
if he knew I came here.

1287
01:36:45,809 --> 01:36:49,358
Danny's got it figured out
that Rusty's happy with what she's got.

1288
01:36:49,529 --> 01:36:51,485
He don't wanna mess it up.

1289
01:36:51,649 --> 01:36:54,561
- Is she happy?
- Oh, she's very happy.

1290
01:36:54,729 --> 01:36:58,039
She lost 10 pounds,
but, of course, it's very becoming.

1291
01:36:58,209 --> 01:37:02,088
If she thinks about it too much,
she can go out and get a little tight...

1292
01:37:02,249 --> 01:37:04,479
...which she's doing quite often lately.

1293
01:37:05,529 --> 01:37:09,602
You probably know what you're doing.
That was a swell thing those kids had.

1294
01:37:09,769 --> 01:37:12,966
I'm glad I'm not the one that broke it up.
I couldn't sleep nights.

1295
01:37:13,129 --> 01:37:15,040
Danny will be wondering where I went.

1296
01:37:15,209 --> 01:37:18,997
If Pearl there is on her toes,
she'll take care of this some way.

1297
01:37:19,169 --> 01:37:22,798
How can I get out without passing
those people? I'm a back-door character.

1298
01:37:22,969 --> 01:37:26,644
Take the door on the left, Genius,
and thanks for coming.

1299
01:37:27,769 --> 01:37:30,761
Oh, sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.

1300
01:37:35,849 --> 01:37:38,238
Well, mastermind?

1301
01:37:38,409 --> 01:37:41,162
- What can I do now?
- Don't be so stubborn!

1302
01:37:41,329 --> 01:37:44,321
You've made a mistake. Admit it.
You've still got time.

1303
01:37:58,009 --> 01:37:59,601
Aren't you even superstitious?

1304
01:37:59,769 --> 01:38:03,887
That pearl's magic. You're liable
to be struck dead or something.

1305
01:38:04,209 --> 01:38:06,279
What pearl's magic?

1306
01:38:07,769 --> 01:38:09,248
This one.

1307
01:38:10,209 --> 01:38:11,642
Where did you get this?

1308
01:38:11,809 --> 01:38:14,004
A person by the name of Genius
brought it.

1309
01:38:14,169 --> 01:38:17,639
Said a person by the name of Danny
found it tonight.

1310
01:38:17,889 --> 01:38:19,880
Danny's at Joe's.

1311
01:38:22,609 --> 01:38:26,727
I've never seen such a
silly-looking pearl in all my life.

1312
01:38:28,129 --> 01:38:31,007
- It's all lopsided.
- Lf it's silly, why are you crying?

1313
01:38:31,169 --> 01:38:33,205
I'm not crying.

1314
01:38:33,769 --> 01:38:38,479
I'm crying because I always cry
when people are getting married.

1315
01:38:38,649 --> 01:38:40,640
Getting married's awful.

1316
01:38:40,809 --> 01:38:43,039
Who ever thought of it
in the first place?

1317
01:38:43,649 --> 01:38:46,243
Well, we're almost there.

1318
01:38:46,409 --> 01:38:48,718
Danny's leaving again tonight.

1319
01:38:49,729 --> 01:38:53,927
Oh, but I can't run away now.

1320
01:38:54,089 --> 01:38:55,602
Not at the last minute.

1321
01:38:56,089 --> 01:38:58,364
Your grandmother could, and did.

1322
01:38:58,529 --> 01:39:01,521
What's the matter,
your family getting soft?

1323
01:39:01,729 --> 01:39:04,641
- My grandmother?
- Go on. Tell her.

1324
01:39:04,809 --> 01:39:08,324
Her grandmother got her into this.
It's up to her to get her out.

1325
01:39:08,489 --> 01:39:10,445
She ran away from me, Rusty.

1326
01:39:10,609 --> 01:39:13,043
At the very last minute.

1327
01:39:13,289 --> 01:39:15,280
In this same room.

1328
01:39:15,449 --> 01:39:17,440
To this same music.

1329
01:39:20,969 --> 01:39:23,005
<i>But she didn't belong with me.</i>

1330
01:39:23,169 --> 01:39:26,923
<i>She belonged to her piano-playing boy</i>
<i>who had the right things to give her.</i>

1331
01:39:27,089 --> 01:39:29,603
<i>Just as you belong to Danny.</i>

1332
01:39:29,769 --> 01:39:32,283
<i>I managed to k eep him away</i>
<i>from the wedding...</i>

1333
01:39:32,449 --> 01:39:37,284
<i>... but just closing the door didn't shut</i>
<i>him out, because I made a mistak e.</i>

1334
01:39:37,449 --> 01:39:39,599
<i>I forgot to hide the piano.</i>

1335
01:39:39,769 --> 01:39:41,680
<i>When she saw that...</i>

1336
01:39:42,009 --> 01:39:45,046
<i>... well, she didn't hear</i>
<i>the "Wedding March" anymore.</i>

1337
01:39:46,089 --> 01:39:47,761
<i>She only heard their music...</i>

1338
01:39:48,529 --> 01:39:51,407
<i>... that I could never learn to play.</i>

1339
01:39:53,129 --> 01:39:56,804
Dearly beloved, we have gathered
together here in the sight of God...

1340
01:39:56,969 --> 01:39:58,721
...and in the presence of this company...

1341
01:39:58,889 --> 01:40:03,440
...to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony.

1342
01:40:03,729 --> 01:40:06,562
Wilt thou, Noel, have this woman
to thy wedded wife...

1343
01:40:06,729 --> 01:40:09,448
...so long as ye both shall live?

1344
01:40:09,729 --> 01:40:10,718
I will.

1345
01:40:10,889 --> 01:40:14,120
And wilt thou, Rusty,
have this man to...?

1346
01:40:14,289 --> 01:40:15,438
L...

1347
01:40:15,889 --> 01:40:18,039
I'm afraid not.

1348
01:40:18,289 --> 01:40:20,723
Thank you very much, but...

1349
01:40:21,329 --> 01:40:24,639
...my grandmother had the happiest life
of any woman ever...

1350
01:40:24,809 --> 01:40:26,925
...because she went back
to Danny. See?

1351
01:40:27,089 --> 01:40:31,082
I mean, she went back
where I belong and...

1352
01:40:31,249 --> 01:40:36,118
It wouldn't even be nice if I got married
to you with this pearl in my hand.

1353
01:40:36,289 --> 01:40:40,441
It's got a silly shape,
but it's very magic, Noel.

1354
01:40:40,609 --> 01:40:43,760
And we'd probably be struck dead, and...

1355
01:40:44,369 --> 01:40:46,599
My grandmother was so happy.

1356
01:40:49,689 --> 01:40:50,883
Well...

1357
01:40:51,049 --> 01:40:54,724
I can't risk getting struck dead,
can I?

1358
01:40:55,729 --> 01:40:59,847
I think you'd better take that thing
and get out of here before it goes off.

1359
01:41:00,009 --> 01:41:01,237
It looks loaded to me.

1360
01:41:02,889 --> 01:41:06,040
- Goodbye, beautiful.
