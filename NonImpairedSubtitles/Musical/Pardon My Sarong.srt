1
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,324
<i>That bus only goes
ten blocks this way,</i>

2
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,729
<i>ten blocks this way
and ten blocks this way.</i>

3
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,994
<i>Why, it doesn't even
have to make a left-hand turn.</i>

4
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,901
Gone! Completely
disappeared! No trace of it!

5
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:48,771
How in heaven's name does
anybody steal a crosstown bus?

6
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,776
What are the drivers' names?

7
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:53,540
Algernon Shaw Harring
and Wellington Phlug.

8
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,638
Ah, this is no time to make jokes!

9
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,808
They're new employees.
Shall I call the police?

10
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:02,150
And have us made the laughingstock of
the country? Get a private detective.

11
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,655
Yes, sir.

12
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:07,853
Crosstown bus disappears
right under our noses!

13
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:11,795
Wait 'til I get my hands
on bus number 5111.

14
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,376
Of all the bus drivers in
Chicago, I had to pick those two.

15
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,645
I should never have let you talk us
into leaving our crosstown bus route.

16
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,414
What are you worrying about?
We'll get a promotion. Yeah.

17
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,682
We'll have our pictures
in the papers.

18
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,190
I know what it's gonna say.
"Wanted by the police."

19
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,693
Nothing of the kind.
Get a load of that.

20
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,059
<i>"Tommy Layton
enters yacht race. "</i>

21
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,861
You mean he's gonna enter this bus in
the boat race? Ye... No, certainly not!

22
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,459
<i>After all...</i>

23
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:57,708
Oh, will you keep your eyes
open? I can't. I'm sleepy.

24
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,938
I didn't get no sleep
in that motel. Why?

25
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,675
Some dummy put the bed in the closet.

26
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,309
It's a Murphy bed. Murphy
should have slept in it.

27
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,785
<i>What are you...</i>

28
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,755
Hold on to that.
Okay, I'll take it.

29
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,984
Drive straight.
We're running out of gas.

30
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,220
Running out of gas? Oh. Yes.

31
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,763
What are you driving so fast for?

32
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:22,323
I got to get to a station
before we run out of gas. No, no.

33
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,337
How you gonna pay for gas? What
are you gonna use for dough?

34
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:35,006
Don't worry about the dough. I'll see
if I can get away with a baseball story.

35
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:38,414
- Hey, you like baseball?
- Do I? I never miss a game.

36
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,779
The last half of the 9th,
the score is tied.

37
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:47,292
Three men on base. Up comes
DiMagg. Three balls, two strikes.

38
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,091
The pitcher winds up,
throws... Zowie, a home run!

39
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,361
The Yanks win five to one. We
sure put it over, didn't we?

40
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,403
Yep, we sure put it over!
We certainly did!

41
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:02,237
Hey!
Hey, come back here!

42
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:05,004
How do you like that!
What happened?

43
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,376
I just got gypped by a
couple wise guys. Yeah?

44
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,554
Where's the nearest gas station?

45
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,056
Never mind him. Fill it up. Fill it up.

46
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:21,025
Come on, girls, relax.
There we are.

47
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,562
How'd you enjoy the
trip? The next one's mine.

48
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,155
What are you doing?

49
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,393
<i>- How'd you enjoy the trip?
- Fine, Tommy.</i>

50
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,004
<i>Come along, girls.</i>

51
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:37,236
Hey, pardon me, but aren't
you Tommy Layton? Yeah.

52
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,369
And we're his nurses. Lucky patient.

53
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,107
<i>I'm from the Oakmont Herald.
How's for a picture?</i>

54
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,115
Sure.
Good.

55
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,514
Thanks, girls.

56
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,281
Come on. Let's get back.
I've had enough air.

57
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:51,983
That'll be $12.50 for the
gas. $12.50 for the gas.

58
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,138
Tell him to put it on the
cuff. Put it on the cuff.

59
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:56,357
What do you mean,
"Put it on the cuff"?

60
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,363
What...

61
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:02,231
Come on. We'll get it off
Mr. Layton. No fighting.

62
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,066
Mr. Layton, the man wants
$12.50 for the gas.

63
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,436
I'll settle everything
at the end of the trip.

64
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,499
Right now, money is
secondary. Just a minute.

65
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:14,239
How 'bout giving me a
little secondary? All right.

66
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,147
Here's $20.00. Keep the
change. $20.00. Keep the change.

67
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:20,515
Thanks.
You're welcome.

68
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,577
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong?

69
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,589
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

70
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,421
Pay the man. How? The
girl took the money.

71
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,826
What girl? The one with the
long red stuff and head too.

72
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,956
Oh, how are we going
to pay for this gas?

73
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:36,195
Wait, I've got it!
Go tell him the baseball story.

74
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,203
The baseball story? The old one?
You know.

75
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,296
They don't know it out
here. They don't know it?

76
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,739
Certainly not. The one
about the guy on...

77
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:47,246
Yes, yes, yes,
you know it. Go ahead.

78
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:50,407
That was $12.50, wasn't it?
That's right.

79
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,043
$12.50,
ha-ha, $12.50.

80
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:58,489
You like baseball? Yeah, I'm
just crazy about baseball.

81
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,152
I think we got 'em.
That's all there is to it.

82
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:05,994
In fact, I'm just dying to have
somebody tell me a baseball story.

83
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,999
Algy, you better tell him. Why?

84
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,467
He's just dying to have somebody
tell him a baseball story.

85
00:06:10,468 --> 00:06:12,308
Aren't you dying to
tell him? I'm just dyin'.

86
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:15,707
Go find out if he heard
the game yesterday. Okay.

87
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:19,142
Did you hear the game yesterday? No.

88
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,646
<i>He didn't hear it.
So?</i>

89
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:26,651
It was some game. It was the last
of the 9th and the score was tied.

90
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,815
Are you sure you didn't
hear the game? No.

91
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,858
You read it in the papers? No.

92
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,894
Hear it on the radio? No!

93
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,898
Okay.

94
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,161
What's the matter? I don't
think it's gonna work.

95
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,635
Is he askin' too many questions?
He knows too many answers.

96
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:48,028
Go over and tell him
the story. Go on, go on.

97
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,369
Okay.
Hurry up.

98
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,740
Joe DiMaggio... Was at bat,
three balls, two strikes.

99
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:56,510
The pitcher winds up, throws.
DiMaggio swings... Zowie, a home run!

100
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,550
The Yanks win five to one!

101
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,711
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

102
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:05,053
Come here, smart guy. Two fellows put
that gag over on me a few minutes ago.

103
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,592
I said the next guy that
did it, I'd break his leg!

104
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,060
What's that got to do with
my change? What change?

105
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,929
My change from the $20 bill
I gave you. You gave me... Oh!

106
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,729
<i>I beg your pardon, sir. That's okay.</i>

107
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,275
After all, you must
trust everybody. Yes, sir.

108
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,640
Here's a tip for you. That's
very generous of you, sir.

109
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,111
That's okay. Thank you. Thank you, sir.

110
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,784
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

111
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:37,289
Ha-ha!
Ooo-ooo-ooo!

112
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,070
Ah, boy, that was swell.

113
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,410
One more?
No, one's enough.

114
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,507
I gotta go for another one.
Wait a minute.

115
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,178
One's enough. If you're
a sissy, I can't help it.

116
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,118
I like the stuff.
What do you mean?

117
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,122
Scotch and soda.
Cuba libra.

118
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,124
Make mine a brandy.
Can't handle it, huh?

119
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:17,424
Getting old. Not me, I got a
hollow leg. Fill it up again!

120
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,795
My friend, Algy, don't think
I can handle this stuff.

121
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:23,302
<i>Thank you. Oh boy.! Whoo-whoo.!</i>

122
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,303
I tell ya,

123
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,703
when I go for this stuff,
I really go for it.

124
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:30,037
I know, but one of those is enough. Nah!

125
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,771
Come on, let's...
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

126
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,678
Take it easy.
Get it out.

127
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,683
That would have cost fifty
cents if you had swallowed that.

128
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,480
Do I worry

129
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,493
'Cause you're stepping out

130
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,257
Do I worry

131
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,822
'Cause you've got me in doubt

132
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,768
Though your kisses aren't right

133
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:01,000
Do I give a bag of beans

134
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,371
Do I stay home every night

135
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:07,105
And read my magazines

136
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,579
Am I frantic

137
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:13,415
'Cause we've lost the spark

138
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,920
Is there panic

139
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:19,549
When it starts turning dark

140
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,185
And when evening shadows creep

141
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:28,359
Do I lose any sleep over you

142
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,335
Do I worry

143
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:39,404
You can bet your life I do

144
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,316
Do I worry

145
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:48,547
When the ice man calls

146
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,749
Do I worry

147
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,884
If Niagara falls

148
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:58,158
Though you treat me just like dirt

149
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,290
Think I give a snap

150
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,835
Are my feelin's really hurt

151
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,497
When you're sittin'
in somebody else's lap

152
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,775
Am I curious

153
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:14,210
When the gossip flies

154
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,340
Am I furious

155
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,647
'Bout your little white lies

156
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,086
<i>When all our evenings end</i>

157
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:26,522
'Cause you got a sick friend

158
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,924
That needs you

159
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:32,089
Do I worry

160
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:36,931
Honey, you know doggone well I do

161
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,273
Now am I frantic

162
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:49,280
'Cause we've lost the spark

163
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,976
Is there panic

164
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,817
When it starts turning dark

165
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,482
<i>And when evening shadows creep</i>

166
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:04,723
<i>Do I lose any sleep over you</i>

167
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:08,233
Do I worry

168
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:13,328
You can bet your life

169
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,006
I do

170
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,981
Think you can walk?
Oh, I'll make it.

171
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,024
Right.
Right.

172
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,025
What's the matter?

173
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,027
I should've never mixed them.
Mixed what?

174
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,757
The chocolate with the
vanilla. Let's go to bed.

175
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:43,768
Hello! Whoo! Come on.

176
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,476
I'm sorry, very sorry. Sorry.

177
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,705
Oh, pictures.
Are they your children?

178
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,247
<i>Hey, looks like somebody I know.
That's us.</i>

179
00:11:56,315 --> 00:12:00,251
You admit it? Whoever took that
picture didn't do a good job on me.

180
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:04,415
Here's a nice invitation for
ya. That's very nice of ya.

181
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,788
Get this: The state of
Illinois sends us greetings.

182
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:10,022
I send greetings right back to
Illinois. I'll send them a postcard.

183
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,121
Do you know what that is? An invitation.

184
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,996
The state of Illinois would
like you to be their guest.

185
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,558
Over the weekend? I'd
say for quite a few years.

186
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:20,161
No, I couldn't sponge
on anybody that long.

187
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,355
We work for a bus
concern in Chicago and

188
00:12:22,356 --> 00:12:24,471
they wouldn't give us
that much time off.

189
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:28,445
It was the bus company that
wants you sent away for a rest.

190
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,813
I don't wanna go. No!
Algy, you don't wanna go?

191
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:35,285
That's being ungrateful. They're
gonna try to give us a vacation.

192
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,687
What's the name of the hotel?
A place called "the pen."

193
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,852
I never heard of that
hotel. That's not a hotel.

194
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,522
It's a place with big walls
around it. Oh, a private place.

195
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,532
Yes, plenty private! Good.

196
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,693
They've got men
walking around the walls.

197
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,101
They're picketing the
place? They're not picketing.

198
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:55,629
They're up there to make sure
that you don't get out.

199
00:12:55,708 --> 00:13:00,839
If you try to, they...
Brr-brr-brr! I understand now!

200
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:04,849
You mean prison guards.
Those guys are tough.

201
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:09,013
<i>When you get inside those
pens... Pens? Uh-huh.</i>

202
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,114
<i>Hotel pen?
Certainly.</i>

203
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,785
Do... do...
A cop!

204
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,385
Certainly!

205
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,793
I beg your pardon.

206
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,807
Are you looking for
someone? I'm looking for...

207
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,809
Oh, I beg your pardon.

208
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,643
How do you do?
Hey, look!

209
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,377
Maybe he can make us
disappear. Let's find out.

210
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,784
Oh, archery.

211
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,916
Oh, come on.
Come on.

212
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,792
Hey, look!
Oh, Marco the Magician.

213
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,798
What are you...
Wait!

214
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,960
Why don't you knock on the
door? I don't give a rap anymore.

215
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:00,870
<i>Ah, bon soir, monsieur.</i>

216
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,465
Oh, come on.
Hey!

217
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,577
Come on.

218
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:15,109
<i>Pardon me. Did you see bus drivers come
in here? Je suis Marco, le Magicien.</i>

219
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,156
Yeah, they stole a bus.

220
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,744
I've got a warrant for these
guys and now they've disappeared.

221
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:23,786
<i>Ah, disappeared!
Oui, oui, oui.</i>

222
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,991
<i>Une fois, deux fois, trois fois.</i>

223
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:30,194
<i>Maintenant, je vais
le faire échapper...</i>

224
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,067
<i>avec un mouchoir...
What are you doing?</i>

225
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:36,073
<i>This guy must be crazy.
Bruler, commencer par...</i>

226
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,575
Wait a minute!
You can't do that!

227
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,578
Disappeared.

228
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,809
What do you mean setting my warrant
on fire? I'll arrest you for arson.

229
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,910
<i>Un instant.</i>

230
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,921
<i>Voila.</i>

231
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,048
<i>C'est un truc tres simple.</i>

232
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,854
<i>Au revoir.</i>

233
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,930
That guy is all right.

234
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,597
You magicians certainly get around.

235
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,606
You go out there and pop up here.

236
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:12,269
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Do me a favor.

237
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,745
<i>Oui, oui. Do that trick
over for me, will ya?</i>

238
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,374
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

239
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,817
<i>You know, where you make
it disappear? Oh, oui, oui.</i>

240
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:25,220
<i>Where you burn it up?
Oui, oui.!</i>

241
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:29,022
<i>Oui, oui.! No, no. Do
it like you did before.</i>

242
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,530
<i>I want to learn it all; fold
it up... Oh, viva la sardines.</i>

243
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,123
Yes, yes.

244
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,998
<i>Oui, oui. No, wrap the
handkerchief around it.</i>

245
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,471
Take my handkerchief.
Now burn it up.

246
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:47,340
<i>Burn it up. Come on. Oui, oui, oui.</i>

247
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:52,043
<i>Yes, sir.
Oui, of course.</i>

248
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,245
Now pull it out of my collar.

249
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,984
Wha... Wha...? The collar!
Pull it outta the collar.

250
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:02,027
Come on!
The collar!

251
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,562
Pull it outta the collar!

252
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,531
No, the collar. Pull it outta
there. Don't you understand?

253
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,830
I'm sorry, I don't speak
English. That's different then.

254
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:14,066
Hey, what are you pullin'?

255
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,537
Another one. How do you do? How are ya?

256
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,580
I suppose you're
Marco the Magician too.

257
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,742
No, I'm his twin brother. Twin brother?

258
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:30,755
Then how come you speak English
and he don't? He was born in France.

259
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,486
If you're twins, why weren't
you born in France with him?

260
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,427
I was traveling with
my aunt at the time.

261
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,589
I'm tired of this
hocus-pocus.

262
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,465
Let me see a trick. If it lays an
egg, you've got explainin' to do.

263
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,867
If it lays an egg?
Yeah.

264
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,872
I'm glad you mentioned eggs.

265
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,068
Take your hat off, please.
Hold your hat in your hand.

266
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,475
Here I have a common, ordinary egg.

267
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:57,140
I am going to break the egg in
your hat and do a trick. In my hat?

268
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:00,242
In your hat and over your ears.

269
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,254
Now, I'm gonna break the egg.

270
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:06,519
There you are. See that? I'll
put that in too. I don't care.

271
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:10,221
Now, I get my ma...

272
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:15,362
Oh, hold it over there.

273
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:19,165
Is something wrong? Plenty,
yeah. Hold it over there.

274
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:24,801
Hocus-pocus,
diddly-okus. And now...

275
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,970
The egg is still in your hat.

276
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,344
Is something wrong?
Uh-huh.

277
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,475
I gotta use more eggs.
Hold the cigar, please.

278
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,213
Now, I take it...

279
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,756
You didn't see nothing wrong?
No, the egg is still there.

280
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,761
I'm glad you saw it.

281
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,662
I crack it again like this.

282
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,031
I put another egg in there.
Then I put in a little salt.

283
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,036
A little salt and pepper.

284
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,038
I get the outboard motor.

285
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,108
There you are.
And now...

286
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,476
we got an omelet.
Hmm, all right.

287
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,607
What do you know? Get them
out. Make them disappear.

288
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,151
You don't have toast
with you, do you? No.

289
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,346
Make them disappear?
Yeah, make 'em disappear.

290
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:13,118
I got a card trick...
Never mind the card trick!

291
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,786
Get those eggs outta my hat!

292
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,920
I got a cute trick...
Never mind!

293
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,294
Come on, listen.

294
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:23,232
Get those eggs outta my hat!

295
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,169
Me and my brother, Marco,
used to do this trick.

296
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:31,335
Then why can't you get 'em out?
That's the part Marco knows.

297
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,810
Somethin' wrong?
Oh, ah-hah!

298
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:37,747
Ah-ho! Ah-ho!
Ah-hah! Ah-hah!

299
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,444
Ah-ho!
Ooo-ooo-ooo!

300
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:48,117
Hey, Wellington!
Hurry up.

301
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,161
Turn around.
Get down!

302
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,331
Ah!

303
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:03,065
Hey, fellas, give me a hand, will ya?

304
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,940
Help me get this box on that truck.

305
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:10,414
<i>Now, wise guys, I've got
you where I want you.</i>

306
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,315
I'm gonna ship you by fast freight.

307
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:16,320
You didn't think I'd catch you, did ya?

308
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,086
Ho-ho. Come on! At least I got you!

309
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,493
You think you can
get away from me, huh?

310
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,622
Come on. Get in there.

311
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:30,156
That'll hold you 'til
I catch your pal. Yeah?

312
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,703
You got outta that box
but you won't get outta there!

313
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,398
<i>I'll guarantee that.!</i>

314
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,611
Thanks.
You're welcome.

315
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,493
Algy, come on, I got him!

316
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,864
You got who? The cop.
I got him in the trunk.

317
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,665
Swell! All by myself, I
put him right in the trunk.

318
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,706
Behind, in the back. Not
in the back, in the trunk.

319
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,436
Behind ya. Not behind me. He's under me.

320
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,469
I'll give you a peek.
Come here. Look.

321
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,481
Look!

322
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,047
All good things must come to an end.

323
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,681
I think while I can
still recognize you,

324
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,725
I'll kiss you all
good-bye.

325
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,260
Tommy!
Tommy!

326
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,262
Why do I always have to be last?

327
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:42,240
Is that as hard as you can slap?

328
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,707
<i>- That's hard enough.!
- What's the matter, Sis?</i>

329
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,749
Just a kissing Tom. Slight
case of mistaken identity.

330
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,718
Not on my part.
Roger, this is Tommy Layton,

331
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,050
the sportsmanlike yachtsman
who stole your crew.

332
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,488
Wait a minute. I don't know
what my agent did, but...

333
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,220
You are Tom Layton? Yeah. So what?

334
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,455
Allow me to introduce myself. Roger!

335
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,249
I don't think he can take it. This
is hardly the place to find out.

336
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,462
He's right. Besides, I have a much
better idea on the crew situation.

337
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:14,801
A much better idea!

338
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,604
<i>Yes, yes</i>

339
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:23,011
Now brothers and sisters Yes, hallelujah

340
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:26,312
We all give the jazz a stride Yes, Elmer

341
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,047
To have one of them good,
old jam sessions Uh-hum

342
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,521
Dishin' out some solid jive Hallelujah

343
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,889
I want all you hepcats
and jitterbugs Yes, yes

344
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,656
<i>Come on up here and get
in the groove Glory, glory</i>

345
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,220
'Cause when that rhythm
hits ya What do we do

346
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,324
Son, that's the time to move

347
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:46,428
Stand up and shout brother, shout

348
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,565
Shout, brother, shout

349
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,371
When that rhythm hits you

350
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:55,504
Shout, brother, shout

351
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:00,381
Don't be afraid Don't hang your heads

352
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,785
Stand up and shout brother, shout

353
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:07,188
Brother, shout Hallelujah

354
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:10,626
Hey, when you get that feeling

355
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,597
<i>Runnin'down your spine</i>

356
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,566
That's that good ol' rhythm

357
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,661
It'll drive you outta your mind

358
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,571
Shout, brother, shout

359
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:26,441
You'll soon find out
you will be happy

360
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,446
<i>If you shout brother, shout</i>

361
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,448
<i>Hallelujah</i>

362
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,521
Shout, brother, shout

363
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:58,586
Shout brother, shout

364
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,689
<i>When that rhythm hits you</i>

365
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,997
<i>Shout, brother, shout</i>

366
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:10,098
Don't be afraid Don't hang your head

367
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,508
Stand up and shout brother, shout

368
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:18,948
Brother, shout

369
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,985
Yes, yes

370
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:28,055
This don't look like the right
road to Chicago. Just keep going.

371
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:33,255
Oooh!

372
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,395
What's the matter now?
Dead end.

373
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,403
All right.
Back up.

374
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,968
I gotta back up.
Go ahead.

375
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,173
Don't you hear me?
Back up!

376
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:53,547
I gotta back up.
Go ahead.

377
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,688
What's the matter
with ya? Back up!

378
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:00,725
I'm gonna back up! Do
as the man tells ya.

379
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,851
Go ahead.

380
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,862
Will you go ahead and back up?

381
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,125
How can you go ahead
and then back up?

382
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:09,166
Back up.
Go ahead.

383
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:13,933
I gotta back up then go... What
kind of bus do you think this is?

384
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:17,441
I'll satisfy the both of
yous. I'll go sideways.

385
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,943
Back up!
Back up!

386
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,930
Hello, Sven.
Hello, Mr. Layton.

387
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:52,374
When I wired you to get me a
crew, I didn't expect you to...

388
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,969
I know, I make mistake.

389
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:57,310
<i>I steal the crew from the Shamrock,</i>

390
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,316
but everything's straightened out.

391
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:02,683
Crew go back to old job.
What did you do, lay them off?

392
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:05,587
Your sister told me you
couldn't get here for the race.

393
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:08,626
My sister! I haven't got any sister.

394
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:10,661
Why, Brother, how you do talk!

395
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,924
Hey.

396
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:16,627
What are you doing on my
boat? Just a little sabotage.

397
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,999
You stole my brother's crew
and I stole it back.

398
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,062
There seems to be some misunderstanding.
I didn't get into town...

399
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,166
That's your story! You
don't want to listen, huh?

400
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:28,804
All right. You asked for
it. Hey, that's my dinghy!

401
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,348
You won't need it. You're
going for a little joyride.

402
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,078
Leave me alone!
Take your hands off me!

403
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,712
How do you dare
manhandle me like this!

404
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,722
Sven, up anchor and
let's get underway.

405
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,315
Oh, no, I don't go on no cruise.

406
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:44,658
Why not? I get seasick every
time I leave the harbor.

407
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:48,187
How do you like that?
Ha-ha-ha. Now where's your crew?

408
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:51,326
Where's my crew?
Right there!

409
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:57,532
If your brother wins, we'll be the
first on hand to congratulate him.

410
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:12,818
<i>I thought I said good-bye to you
guys. What are you doing down there?</i>

411
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:16,019
Hello, Mr. Layton. How are ya?
We're hitchhiking to Chicago.

412
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:19,996
<i>Hey, Chicago!</i>

413
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:24,297
Mr. Layton, could you use a
couple fugitives from justice?

414
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,338
- I could use able-bodied seamen.
- You could?

415
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:29,373
If any pass by, I'll let you know.

416
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,432
We got a job! Get up there! Okay.

417
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:34,535
Chicago! All right! Give me a hand.

418
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:37,445
Take it easy!

419
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:41,178
How've you been?
Fine.

420
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:44,983
<i>Wait for me.! All right. Come on.</i>

421
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,524
<i>Give me your hand.</i>

422
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,328
You're all right.
It's only water.

423
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,366
<i>Look at that.!
What is that thing?</i>

424
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:58,368
That's a seal. Sure. A seal?

425
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:01,064
They make fur coats.
They make fur coats?

426
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,903
How do they teach them
that kind of work?

427
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:06,034
That's Sharkey. He's
the pet of the harbor.

428
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:10,343
He is? Can we bring him on the boat.
Sure.

429
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,441
<i>Sharkey.!
Sharkey.!</i>

430
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,486
<i>Come on.!</i>

431
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,028
Lunchtime!

432
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,224
Lunch? Oh, sardines. Now, now, now.

433
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:31,200
<i>- You can't eat that.
- Oh, little sardines.</i>

434
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,567
You put a hole in the can.

435
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:36,039
Mr. Layton promised to
pay for the bus, and

436
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,439
he promised a bonus
if we win this race.

437
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,478
<i>Oh, good.</i>

438
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:43,571
What's the idea?
What's the matter?

439
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,912
Keep your hands to yourself.

440
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,918
Keep your hands to yourself.

441
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:51,478
I'm keepin' them on the wheel. Don't
hit me. Keep your hands on the wheel.

442
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,547
You know I'm brittle.
Don't hit me there.

443
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,093
Never mind that.
It's no time to clown.

444
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,161
What'd I tell ya! What are
ya hittin' me in the face for?

445
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,896
Keep your hands on the
wheel. Oh, piffle-diffle!

446
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,598
Here, here! You made me say a bad word.

447
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:11,733
Keep your remarks to yourself
and keep your hands on the wheel.

448
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,778
Keep your course
northeast by southeast.

449
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:17,212
You don't know anything
about this sailor stuff.

450
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:19,216
There's a compass.
Read it.

451
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,253
There's north, northeast;
South, southeast.

452
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,756
What's the matter?
You nervous?

453
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,917
Only around southeast.
Oh, go ahead.

454
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:31,120
All right, Wellington,
I'll take the wheel.

455
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:34,791
Give him the wheel. Not
that way. Put that back!

456
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:38,302
Come on. What kind of
a sailor are you?

457
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:40,667
Watch out!
Watch yourself.

458
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:44,037
Am I glad you were there, or else...

459
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:46,133
We can stand more canvas, boys.

460
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:49,738
Ease the main, douse the jib,
and break out the spinnaker.

461
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:53,545
What are you doing?
Come on, come on.

462
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:56,052
What are you going down
there for? Gonna eat.

463
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,054
Didn't you hear what
the skipper said? Yeah.

464
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:01,819
He says peas and giblets and break out a
can of spinach. No, this stuff up here.

465
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,225
How you gonna eat that? Come up here!

466
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:07,787
You've got to give me something I
can eat. I can't digest that canvas.

467
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,927
Get up here.
Don't fall overboard.

468
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,174
Hold on.
There's too many ropes.

469
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,573
Jibe-o!

470
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,873
Jibe-o! What kind of
double-talk is that?

471
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:22,572
Jibe-o!
Jibe-o!

472
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:26,208
Oh, jibe-o!
That's it!

473
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:32,379
Algy, Algy!

474
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,925
<i>Wellington, are you all right?</i>

475
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:37,826
Algy, look at the big sardine!

476
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:41,822
Pull me in!

477
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,892
Always playin' around.

478
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,768
Come on.
There you are.

479
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,241
What are you tryin' to do,
rip the man's canvas?

480
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,778
Get in the corner
and behave yourself.

481
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:58,009
What are you so mean for? He's
always getting into trouble.

482
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,415
<i>Algy.! Algy.! What's he doing now?</i>

483
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:04,250
Get me up!
Get me up!

484
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:08,786
<i>Come on, get up. What are you
trying to do, commit suicide?</i>

485
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,455
Oh, always in a mess.
Get up on your feet.

486
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,464
You all right?
Oh, boy!

487
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:18,229
Behave yourself.
I was standing with sharks!

488
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,601
My other foot!
My other foot!

489
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,436
What's the matter?
The shark got it!

490
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:26,204
My other foot! There's your other foot.

491
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,871
Who put that there?
Oh, come on.

492
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,178
Snap into it.
Okay, sorry.

493
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,753
There's a little slack in the canvas.

494
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:41,383
Don't bother.
I'll get it.

495
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:45,987
You're quite a sailor, Miss Marshall.

496
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:48,555
You've been doing three
men's work on this cruise.

497
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,158
I want you to get
everything you deserve.

498
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:54,898
I'm sure you'll see that I get it.

499
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,636
They sure hate each other.
Well enough to get married.

500
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,804
Wouldn't you marry a
pretty girl like that? No.

501
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:04,040
I'd marry a homely girl. Why?

502
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,310
If you marry a pretty girl,
she's liable to run away.

503
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:10,480
A homely girl is apt to run
away too. Yeah, but who cares?

504
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:15,720
Why should we fight? Even the
worst enemies declare a truce.

505
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:17,727
Then we're certainly eligible.

506
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:21,959
Armistice?
Armistice.

507
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:25,799
Those stars would look
lovely in your hair,

508
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,633
especially Polaris.

509
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:32,005
Polaris! What's it doing up
there? It should be over here!

510
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:36,179
I told you to follow that star!

511
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:40,775
I passed that one. You better
pick me out another one.

512
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,786
We're way off our course.

513
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,721
Who jimmied that compass?
I can't imagine.

514
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,724
The barometer's falling.

515
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:50,090
You better pick it up
before somebody steps on it.

516
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:54,825
Did you fix that too? No, I forgot
that one! What does it read now?

517
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:58,096
A bad storm. We're miles
off the sea lanes.

518
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:01,866
You mean, I'm blazing a new
trail? Right into a typhoon.

519
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:06,569
That's okay. I can't catch it.
Vaccinated! Never mind that!

520
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:25,390
How do you like that?
I cut my head off!

521
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,757
All hands on deck!

522
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,027
<i>What'd you say?
All hands on deck.!</i>

523
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,091
<i>All hands on deck?
Yeah.</i>

524
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,897
<i>Okay, here's mine.</i>

525
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:13,075
Come up here. We've
lost control of the boat.

526
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:16,944
The finance company's gonna
take it? Come on up here! Hurry!

527
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,021
Boy, what a storm!

528
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,624
Come on, get up there ahead.

529
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,720
Huh?
Get up there.

530
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:36,824
Whoo-hoo!

531
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,495
What are you doing? I
said up there! I slipped!

532
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,267
Well, slip back.
Go on, get up there!

533
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,275
Oh, water!

534
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:50,107
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Whee!

535
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:54,311
What did I just get through
telling you? Go up there!

536
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:57,752
I slid!
Now get up there!

537
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,382
<i>Algy.!</i>

538
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:03,791
- How'd you get out there?
- Get me off!

539
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:07,194
<i>Man overboard.!
Get me off!</i>

540
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:23,377
Well, sip it slowly. That's
the last of the water.

541
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:26,280
Here you are; breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.

542
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:30,309
What's different? That's
all we've had for ten days.

543
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:34,518
The only difference is, after
this is gone, there isn't any more.

544
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:42,623
Just a minute. We're
partners, aren't we? Yeah.

545
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,692
We split everything fifty-fifty,
don't we? I know, but...

546
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,568
Never mind "you know."
I know.

547
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,971
Whether on land or sea,
makes no difference.

548
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:55,308
Partners are partners. You've
got two beans, I haven't got any.

549
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:59,076
How come? You wouldn't
want to share that way. No.

550
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,675
Here.
Wait a minute.

551
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:05,711
What's the matter? It's the small
one. I wanna give you the big one.

552
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,816
My mother always told me to treat
my friends like that. That's nice.

553
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,123
Give the biggest of
everything. That's swell.

554
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:14,460
Mmm.

555
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,066
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

556
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,069
I'm gonna eat this half. Why?

557
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:22,264
You've got two halves.
I haven't got any.

558
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,674
You shouldn't eat so fast.
What kind of partner are you?

559
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,679
I'm entitled to half of that bean.

560
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,910
Come on. That's better. There.

561
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,849
You ought to be ashamed.

562
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:39,322
He's always trying to
make a hog out of himself.

563
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,450
Sorry. Go ahead and eat it.

564
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:45,154
This is mine?
Go ahead!

565
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,561
You're gonna let me
eat this whole half?

566
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:51,295
I've always got to
give you the best of it.

567
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:54,532
Take it easy and chew it up good.

568
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,869
Chew it good. I'm gonna make it last.

569
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,068
I'm gonna put it from here
to here and here to here.

570
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:03,011
And sometimes up here.
It's up there now.

571
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,140
Where's it now?
It's gone.

572
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:13,815
Sharkey, boy, am I hungry!

573
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,492
<i>This program is coming to you
from Pete's Bar and Grill.</i>

574
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:22,964
<i>Stop in for one of our
famous chicken dinners:</i>

575
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,264
<i>Delicious chicken, mashed potatoes,</i>

576
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:27,429
<i>corn on the cob, new green peas,</i>

577
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:30,941
<i>combination salad, pie and coffee.</i>

578
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:34,273
<i>Today's blue-plate special
is spaghetti.</i>

579
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:37,371
<i>With meatballs? Yes, with meatballs.</i>

580
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,678
Thanks.

581
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,189
I guess we might as well
wash these dishes.

582
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:50,853
What'll you use for water?
There's an ocean full of it.

583
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:54,386
Throw them overboard.
We won't need 'em anymore.

584
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:02,672
Wellington?
What?

585
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,436
I can't stand to see you
starve to death.

586
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:09,172
I just sneaked Mr. Layton's
gun. I can't eat that!

587
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:11,737
Who wants you to eat it?
It's the only way out.

588
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,750
You want me to demolish myself?

589
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,412
<i>It's the only honorable thing
I could do.</i>

590
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,422
I don't think Sharkey likes
the idea. He's tellin' ya off.

591
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,789
There's one less
we'll have to worry about.

592
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,794
What do you mean?
You'll find out.

593
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,989
Are you ashamed to see me do it?

594
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:31,935
Don't cry.
You make me feel sad.

595
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:35,995
Here, blow your nose.

596
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:38,541
That's enough. It's the
only handkerchief I got.

597
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:42,739
I know, but it's clean,
I'm tellin' ya.

598
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:48,279
Good-bye, Sharkey.

599
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:53,680
<i>Aw, Sharkey.!</i>

600
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:56,420
<i>Poor Wellington.</i>

601
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,428
Wellington!

602
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:03,229
Wellington! Are you all
right? What happened?

603
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,030
I missed.
I'm awfully sorry.

604
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:09,436
You missed. You... Land!

605
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:13,136
<i>Land.!
Land, everybody.!</i>

606
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,201
We're saved! Oh, boy! Put the gun down!

607
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,338
Land! How do you like that? Put it away!

608
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,906
Right over there we got land!

609
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,111
Don't point at me!
Don't point at me!

610
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:26,855
Maybe we better separate and see
if we can find any signs of life.

611
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,620
If you see anything,
blow this whistle.

612
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:33,356
<i>Be careful. Some of these islands
are inhabited by cannibals.</i>

613
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,764
Cannibals! Oh! Ooo-ooo.
What's the matter?

614
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:40,463
They're not gonna make
no shore dinner outta me.

615
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:43,564
Are you sure there're cannibals? Yep.

616
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,271
You were kidding about
those cannibals, weren't you?

617
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,870
You never can tell.

618
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:54,111
Maybe we'd better
kind of stick together.

619
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:58,144
That won't be necessary.
You wanna go on alone?

620
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:01,919
I suppose you think
I'm afraid. Huh!

621
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,206
Oh, Tommy!

622
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,208
<i>Tommy, where are you? Wait a minute.</i>

623
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:24,111
Oh, Tommy! I guess it would
be foolish if we got separated.

624
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,274
What's the matter?
You're not afraid, are you?

625
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:30,286
No, but there are animals
around here, wild animals.

626
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:33,380
Really?
I haven't seen any.

627
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:37,450
I heard 'em, just as plain...
You did, huh?

628
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:40,361
Come on.
Oh.

629
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:43,958
All that stuff about cannibals on
the island, that's all bunk. Sure.

630
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:47,492
Layton's liable to tell you
there's headhunters here.

631
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:52,634
That's only in storybooks. I've been
around. Certainly. That's ridiculous.

632
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,611
Ooo-ooo-ooo!

633
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,673
Algy.
Algy!

634
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:03,151
Algy, what did they do to you?

635
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:07,123
What's the matter with you?

636
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:10,126
Algy! Oh! Here I am.

637
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:14,358
Don't you ever play jokes
on me! Shh, not so loud.

638
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:17,958
If there's any cannibals,
you'll attract them to us.

639
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:21,232
We've gotta do something
to protect ourselves.

640
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:24,797
Take that shield. That's a shield.
A what?

641
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,605
That's a protector.
Get a club.

642
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:30,670
Get a club! Let me look at it. I got it.

643
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,683
Now you're set...
What are you doing?

644
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,981
That's not for that.

645
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,113
Now if a cannibal comes around,
you're ready to protect me.

646
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:41,589
Sure.
Sure.

647
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,786
<i>I'm all ready to protect you? Certainly!</i>

648
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:46,421
I don't want to get inquisitive,

649
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:49,489
but who is going to protect me?

650
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,501
Don't worry about a thing.

651
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:56,029
See that whistle?
That'll protect you. Okay.

652
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:58,097
Everything all right?

653
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:01,269
That whistle is going
to protect me. Certainly.

654
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,643
How?
I blow the whistle,

655
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:06,410
he turns to find out
where the noise is.

656
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:09,350
You hit him over the
head with the club. Oh!

657
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,389
You got it? When you blow the whistle,

658
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,515
and the cannibal turns
around... Turns around.

659
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,083
When he does...
bop on the head!

660
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:19,857
Now you've got it!
Let's find something to eat.

661
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,955
Wait! Don't you forget
to blow the whistle.

662
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:24,330
I'll blow the whistle
if it's the last thing I do.

663
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:28,303
If you don't, it'll be
the last thing I do.

664
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:32,274
You! I ain't a-scared
of you guys!

665
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:35,676
Whoo! What's the matter?
Can't you take a joke?

666
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,839
This is all right!

667
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,155
Looks like it's been made
from the hull of an old ship.

668
00:43:40,156 --> 00:43:42,775
At least somebody
lives on this island.

669
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:45,686
Hello in there!

670
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:48,156
Whoo-hoo!
Hello?

671
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:56,496
Judging by these books, whoever
lives here must understand English.

672
00:43:56,567 --> 00:44:01,368
<i>We might be in luck. Maybe the
natives are civilized. Unfortunately,</i>

673
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,429
that is not the case.

674
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,843
My name's Varnoff.
Hello.

675
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:11,403
I'm sorry you find us snooping,
but... We feel kinda silly.

676
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:15,748
How did you get here? We met with a
storm, lost our sails and here we are.

677
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:19,949
Yeah, um, what island
is this? It's uncharted.

678
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:24,654
<i>Don't tell me you were shipwrecked
too? I came quite intentionally.</i>

679
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:27,253
You see, I'm something
of an archaeologist.

680
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,164
The ancient treasure of
this island fascinates me.

681
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:32,930
Do you think you could
help us rig some sails?

682
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:36,666
That shouldn't be impossible. The
natives speak a little English.

683
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,106
But they are an unpredictable
lot, as you'll learn.

684
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:43,340
I'll take you to the village and
see what can be done. Wonderful!

685
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,772
<i>Come on, Wellington.
Okay.</i>

686
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,409
What's the matter with you? Hey, Algy?

687
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,476
<i>Look at the chicken.
Where?</i>

688
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,249
<i>Chicken?
What a chicken!</i>

689
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:54,916
Algy, blow the whistle!

690
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:57,358
What'd I do with it?
What do you want me to do?

691
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,362
Wait!
Where'd I put it?

692
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,625
<i>Blow the whistle.!
All right.</i>

693
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,532
Blow the whistle!

694
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:12,272
<i>Now, don't get excited. Why
didn't you blow that whistle?</i>

695
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:14,674
I forgot where I put it.
You forgot where you put it?

696
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:17,385
Keep it in your mouth. Give me
the whistle. All right, all right.

697
00:45:17,386 --> 00:45:19,374
<i>All right, take it.
Take it easy.</i>

698
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:22,544
Here he comes!

699
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:26,521
<i>Blow the whistle. Not
that.! Nothing comes out!</i>

700
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:30,720
Not that! The whistle. Blow
the whistle! It won't work!

701
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:33,991
<i>Blow that whistle.!</i>

702
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,726
<i>Ow.! Ow.!
Not that.!</i>

703
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,734
Blow the whistle.
All right!

704
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,938
How do you like that?
Algy?

705
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:50,878
Hey, Algy, what happened?
You must be tired.

706
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:53,143
I think I will scout
the island alone.

707
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:01,681
Algy, move over.

708
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,900
<i>Stop it.!</i>

709
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,936
<i>All right.!</i>

710
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:16,837
Stop that. Get your hands
off me! Take it easy.

711
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:20,399
Miss Joan, Mr. Layton,
won't you help us?

712
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:22,411
They're gonna make
beef stew out of us.

713
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:30,080
What'd he say?

714
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:31,914
You dared to disturb
the shrine of departed

715
00:46:31,915 --> 00:46:33,646
warriors and must pay the penalty.

716
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:38,320
Oh! Look, mister,
tell the head man...

717
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:41,023
Tell him I'd like to die my own way.

718
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:42,463
How do you want to die?

719
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,524
Of old age.

720
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:48,002
If not that, Chief,

721
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:50,232
I'll die of starvation.

722
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,867
Starvation takes a long time.

723
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:55,070
That's all right, I'll wait!
I'm willing!

724
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:00,375
You people are fortunate.

725
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:04,181
The chief likes your little
fat friend. He thinks he's cute.

726
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:07,883
He invites you to become his
friends over a cup of native wine.

727
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:16,593
Hey, Algy, come here.

728
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,101
What's that funny-looking
thing? That's a bell.

729
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:22,400
That ain't no bell! I say that's a bell.

730
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:26,203
It's too big. You see
that? That's a clapper.

731
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:28,437
That's a clapper? That's
what makes the sound.

732
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:32,278
Are you trying to tell me this
is a bell? Don't holler at me!

733
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,520
<i>Moolah, Moolah.!</i>

734
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:41,820
Quiet!

735
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:44,656
Moolah! Moolah!

736
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:48,528
What's this "Moolah"
business. Moolah means hero.

737
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,931
There's a legend that
every time that bell rings,

738
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:53,299
the hero of Mantua will appear
and reconquer for them...

739
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,305
their haunted temple
in the mountains.

740
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,475
Oh, hello.
Thank you, girls.

741
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:11,249
What a beautiful violet.
That luana, love flower.

742
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:13,721
Me Luana, love flower too!

743
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:17,590
You love flower? All girls
on island named after flower.

744
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:21,927
How do you like that? These giggling
kids are all named after flowers.

745
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:24,763
Me Amo, passion flower.

746
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:27,668
Me Ferna, beauty flower.

747
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:32,538
You Algy, wallflower.

748
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:35,305
Moolah, Moolah.
What's this Moolah?

749
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:38,576
You are big hero!
Me a big hero?

750
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:42,710
And you shall marry Luana,
daughter of chief. That's me.

751
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:46,085
No, no, Whaba, no!

752
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:48,420
Hey, hey, just a minute!

753
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,460
Kid, do you need help? Yes.

754
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:54,896
All right. Listen, you.
I was talking to the young lady.

755
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:59,664
You're big enough to help
yourself. Luana no marry Moolah!

756
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:01,363
Marry me!

757
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:05,602
Why should I marry you?
You don't appeal to me. Bah!

758
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:07,166
Bah!
Bah!

759
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:09,371
Bah!

760
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:18,252
Ha-ha!
Didn't even hurt.

761
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:28,020
<i>Lovely Luana</i>

762
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:33,866
<i>Ooo-ahh-ooo</i>

763
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:38,101
Flower of love

764
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:43,272
<i>Lovely Luana</i>

765
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:45,440
Ooo-ahh-ooo

766
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:51,750
Pretty South Sea flower

767
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:56,759
Lovely Luana

768
00:49:56,827 --> 00:50:03,995
You haunt the tropic night

769
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:09,835
Oh, but you're lovely

770
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:16,141
When the moonbeams shower

771
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:21,742
Angelic blossom

772
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:28,519
You bloom in pale moonlight

773
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:36,694
If you should see Luana bloom

774
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:43,070
The night a full moon glows

775
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:49,340
It means you'll find your loved one

776
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:54,680
<i>That's how the legend goes</i>

777
00:50:54,751 --> 00:51:00,383
<i>Lovely Luana</i>

778
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:07,090
In your starlit hour

779
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:12,659
Lovely Luana

780
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:20,736
Please bloom for me tonight

781
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:50,422
Love your Luana

782
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:58,500
<i>Love your South Sea flower</i>

783
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:03,136
Kiss your Luana

784
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:13,115
She blooms for you tonight

785
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:18,393
Ohhh!

786
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:25,027
Moolah!

787
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:27,729
Hello! Hello!
How are ya?

788
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:30,364
Ooo, Moolah!

789
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,738
What are you doing? See
you girls later tonight.

790
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,277
Algy and I was playin'
under the tree.

791
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:37,745
This is a very old tree. She
says it's a very old tree.

792
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:41,011
Lovers have met under
this tree for years.

793
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:44,952
Ooo-ooo-ooo!
Well?

794
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:46,454
Why don't you go home? I will not.

795
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:48,582
After all, you know... Never mind!

796
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:51,126
But me and... All right, keep quiet.

797
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:53,321
I know, but...
What's the matter?

798
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,387
Go on home! Somebody's
calling you. I will not.

799
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:57,592
There's nobody calling.
There is not. There is too.

800
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:01,330
Algy? That's you, I heard you. Sit down.

801
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:06,103
Algy, do me a favor,
please? Go home. I will not!

802
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:08,616
Look, two's company and three's
a crowd. All right, go home.

803
00:54:08,617 --> 00:54:12,309
Okay. No!
You go!

804
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:15,078
I will not. After all,
she's my Latin beauty.

805
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:17,676
So? Aren't ya? I hope.

806
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:21,019
Luana, what was you saying
about this old tree?

807
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,993
This tree is called the
tree of truth. Tree of truth?

808
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:27,894
Yes. If you tell a lie
under this tree,

809
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:30,432
something will happen to you. Yeah?

810
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:34,766
I got nothing to worry about
'cause I never tell lies. Ohh!

811
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:39,172
See? You told a lie. I was only kiddin'.

812
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:41,233
What goes on here?

813
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:44,109
Take it easy. I ain't
gonna tell more lies!

814
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,148
Come here.
What's the matter?

815
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:49,049
Every time I talk, I
get hit. What can I do?

816
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,952
Tell her a story. They love
stories. Tell her a story?

817
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:54,422
I got a pip!
Go ahead.

818
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,516
Luana, I gotta tell you a story.

819
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:59,619
Once upon a time,
there was a merchandising agent.

820
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:02,096
He saw a farmhouse.
He knocked on the door and...

821
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:07,102
Wait a minute. Just a minute!
Get your hand off my head!

822
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,661
Just a minute.
You can't tell that story.

823
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:12,606
I'll tell the one about my father,
the engineer on the railroad.

824
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:15,406
Why didn't you tell that one in
the first place? I don't know.

825
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:18,174
Go ahead. No one likes to
talk about their own parentage.

826
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:21,581
Go ahead. I got to tell another
story 'cause he didn't like the first.

827
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,710
This story's about my father.

828
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:26,312
Once upon a time, my father
was an engineer on the railroad.

829
00:55:26,343 --> 00:55:28,223
He was going 70 miles per hour
down the track.

830
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:30,344
The train stopped and
he didn't know what was wrong.

831
00:55:30,345 --> 00:55:32,625
He went into the tool box
and he couldn't find no tools.

832
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:35,824
What did he do?
He went to the farmhouse...

833
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:40,666
Just a minute! Enough is
enough. I didn't finish yet.

834
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:43,171
That's the same story. Is it?

835
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:45,298
Same story and you know
it. What do you know?

836
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:48,215
Can I tell the story if I put a
whistle with the train? Certainly not!

837
00:55:48,216 --> 00:55:51,180
Okay. Why don't you tell
her something interesting,

838
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:53,374
something about our country
and some great people?

839
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,509
You mean history?
History! There's the idea.

840
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:59,316
Now you're talking sense.
Honey, I gotta change my story.

841
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:02,688
He didn't like number one and number
two. I'm gonna like number three.

842
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:05,421
I'm gonna tell you about the
history of our great country.

843
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:08,953
That's swell.
One time many years ago,

844
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,808
somebody threw some tea in the ocean,

845
00:56:10,809 --> 00:56:12,529
and there was a lot of confusion
about it.

846
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:16,265
Paul Revere, he was a big man at
that time. He had a wonderful horse.

847
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:18,899
He got on his horse and he
said, "The Redcoats are coming!"

848
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:22,308
He was going down a road.
He came to a door...

849
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:26,281
No you don't! I didn't even
get the guy off the horse.

850
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:28,817
Never mind that! Let me
get the guy off the horse!

851
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,479
That's the same story.
Please, wait a minute.

852
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,148
Moolah, what did the man want?

853
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,590
Well, you see, he... Now!

854
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:41,562
Oh, he...
he, he...

855
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:44,896
Moolah, what did he want?

856
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:47,766
He wanted a glass of milk.

857
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,080
I realize these visitors
may disrupt our plans,

858
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:03,415
but I have a way
of making use of them.

859
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:06,404
We got plenty out of the
last guys we kidded

860
00:57:06,405 --> 00:57:09,322
the natives into sending
up to the temple.

861
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,326
Why don't we call it quits?

862
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:14,227
Not until we get the
sacred ruby of Mantua.

863
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:16,731
Do you realize what it's worth?

864
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,234
Okay.

865
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:23,636
<i>But who's gonna be the next
sacrifice? Leave that to me.</i>

866
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:28,666
Tabor, tomorrow night there's to be a
feast in honor of these new arrivals.

867
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:31,213
When the festivities
are at their height,

868
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:34,273
I want the volcano to erupt.

869
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:37,148
Make it very effective.

870
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,381
Use plenty of fireworks.

871
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:03,041
Moolah!

872
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:08,546
<i>Kneel.</i>

873
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,153
Moolah.
Moolah.

874
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:16,386
My son.

875
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:18,393
My daddy.

876
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:20,622
<i>Moolah.</i>

877
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:22,494
Moolah.

878
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:26,394
Moolah, Wellington.

879
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:32,769
Remember,

880
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:37,541
you marry Luana, you be dead husband.

881
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:40,208
Get your hand off me!

882
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:43,844
I am a hero.
You are a stinker.

883
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,014
What you mean?
What you call stinker?

884
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,354
Well, that's...
No!

885
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:54,192
You see a stinker...
a stinker's a great man!

886
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:57,097
You bet your life me stinker.

887
00:58:57,166 --> 00:59:01,466
My father was stinker.
My brother stinker.

888
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,836
My whole family stinkers!

889
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:07,172
Yeah, but you're the biggest
stinker of'em all. Thank you.

890
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:08,870
Thank you.

891
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:13,507
You're the biggest stinker on the
whole island. Thank you, thank you.

892
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:15,107
Thank you.

893
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:17,118
Him no stinker.

894
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:19,711
No, no!
Ah, no!

895
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:23,122
<i>You no stinker.
Too small.</i>

896
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:25,422
Only me stinker.

897
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:28,464
Yeah. Biggest stinker
I ever saw!

898
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:31,500
Thank you.
Thank you.

899
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:37,539
You marry Luana...

900
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:39,541
Yeah.

901
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:43,477
I don't think he means a shave.
He don't.

902
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:53,281
Wellington seems to be doing all
right. Luana's a very pretty girl.

903
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:57,554
Second prettiest girl on the
island. You're too complimentary.

904
00:59:57,627 --> 01:00:02,428
You haven't been dipping in that cava
bowl, have you? Oh, no, not a drop.

905
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:06,332
This is your wedding feast. I warn you.

906
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,264
Go ahead and eat. I
can't. I lost my appetite.

907
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,831
Take a drink.
Maybe it'll bring it back.

908
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:17,608
Yes, you will take a drink with me!

909
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,614
Your last drink!

910
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:24,415
Oh. Algy, let's you and I
get out of here. Oh, behave.

911
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:28,048
I'm scared. I can feel
chills running up my spine.

912
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,115
Up and down your spine. No, up my spine!

913
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:32,184
They got no strength
for a return trip.

914
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:40,667
I'm gettin' a Mickey.

915
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:42,671
Oh.

916
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:46,107
Drink.

917
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,337
Look over there.
Who's that?

918
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:05,118

He is to marry the daughter
of the chief.

But only after he has proved
himself the hero of Mantua.

I'm not a good man.
No, I'm not.

plays hooky four days a week, good? No.

Would you call a kid that tells
tattletales, good? No.

You wouldn't call that
a good boy, would ya?

994
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:26,574
I'm a bad boy!
Wait a minute.

995
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:29,133
You can't run yourself down
like this. Shut up, will ya?

996
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:32,009
Quiet! Keep out of this. Chief,
I've known this boy all my life.

997
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:34,015
Shut up. He's starting
to believe me. Quiet!

I've never met a finer,
more upright and honest a boy.

Will you keep your mouth shut?
Keep quiet!

1000
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:43,653
This boy is an honorary member
of the Camp Fire Girls.

1001
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:46,718
Troop 35. Now shut up. Keep quiet!

1002
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:50,732
You know what this means? My
life is in danger. Your life?

1003
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,792
Certainly! If I go up
there, think of me!

1004
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:57,327
Think of the rest of the people
on the island!

I'm a killjoy.
I'll say you are.

1008

All right.
If that's what it means,

1009
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:09,784
I'll go into that temple.

1010
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:12,184
I'll face danger!
I knew you would.

boogeyman's in there. Atta boy.

thing I want you to do.

1013
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:20,858
What's that?
Talk me out of it.

1014
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,727
You like that speech?

1015
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:25,892
Hey, Father! Father!
They're taking your son!

1016
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:31,931
What makes you think
Varnoff's in on this?

1017
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:34,127
It's just a hunch, but
I want to protect Wellington.

1018
01:08:34,128 --> 01:08:35,608
I think Varnoff's responsible for the

1019
01:08:35,609 --> 01:08:37,489
disappearance of those
five men in the temple.

1020

You have to prove it to me.
That's what I intend to do.

You and your melodramatic plots.

Let's hear it again
just to make sure.

1031
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:20,917
The idea is to get the jewels and
hold the little fat guy as hostage...

1032
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,015
until we're ready
to leave the island.

1033
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:26,653
You're going to capture him
when he goes into the temple?

1034
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:29,129
<i>That was the understanding,
wasn't it?</i>

1035
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,962
It was, but we may
have to change things.

<i>Oh, will we?</i>

1037
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:35,970
Tie them up.

1038
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:39,633
Let me go!
Stop it! Stop it!

1039
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:43,838
I'll see you people later. I have
to make an appearance at the temple.

Me and my melodramatic plots, huh?

1041
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:10,862
If Moolah go, I go too.

1042
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:12,703
<i>That ain't a bad idea.
No.!</i>

1043
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:15,801
<i>Moolah go alone.
Oh no.</i>

1044
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:22,383
Chief, what is this?

1045
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:25,511
<i>Sacredjewel of Mantua.</i>

1046

That's the best news I ever
heard. That's wonderful!

1048
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:36,464
Oh, boy! The chief says as long as I
wear this, nothing can happen to me.

1049
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:38,363
<i>That's a wonderful jewel.</i>

1050
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:41,892
Ain't that gorgeous?
Ooo-ooo!

1051
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:43,836
All right.

1052
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,898
That's enough! You told
me that thing was tame.

1053
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:49,240
Shh.
Go ahead up there.

1054
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:51,711
Luana, good-bye.

1055
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:57,079
All right, that's enough.
That's enough!

1056
01:10:57,152 --> 01:11:00,019
If that don't make a man
out of me, nothing else will.

1057
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:03,024
Forward... march!

1058
01:11:21,543 --> 01:11:25,309
Algy? Algy! Yes, yes. I'm still here.

1059
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:28,248

Here.
What's this for?

1063
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:41,191
That's the dollar I owe
you. The dollar you owe me?

1064
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:44,255
You pick out a fine time to pay me!

1065
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:47,461
Where am I gonna spend
a dollar up there?

1066
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:50,232
He gives me the dollar now
that he owes me six months ago.

1067
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:54,299
Go on up those stairs.
Be brave!

1068
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:57,368
You want these people
to think I'm a coward?

1069
01:11:57,446 --> 01:12:01,348
No, sir. I'm sorry. It
won't happen again. Atta boy.

01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:33,672
Nobody home.

1072
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:38,685
Now I'm all alone.

1073
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:43,582
Algy always told me
when I was alone to sing.

1074
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:53,093
Deep in the heart ofTexas

1075
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:01,506
Give me that jewel.

1076
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:04,603
I can't give that to you. It's my
life protection. Give me that jewel!

1077
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:08,377
I got to take my hat off
to give it to you.

1078
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:11,283
I can't get it over my head
unless I do.

1079
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:15,153
Would you mind... holding...
my hat?

1080
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:19,221
Algy, don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

1081
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:23,487
Go get him!

1082
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:25,556
Ooh! Ooh!

1083
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:36,836
<i>Ooooh.!</i>

1084
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:41,408
Ooo! Ooo!

1085
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:49,455
Get him! Get him now!

1086
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:53,217
Algy, hello!

1087
01:13:53,295 --> 01:13:55,229
Nothing happened to you? Not yet.

1088
01:13:55,297 --> 01:13:59,028
- Boss, there he is!
- Over to the statue!

1089
01:14:06,308 --> 01:14:10,005
He's somewhere in here.
They certainly disappeared.

1090
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:12,478
<i>Let's go.!</i>

1091
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:16,780
They're around here.
Scatter and look for 'em.

1092
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,015
Ooo-ooo!

1093
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:26,527
<i>Gotta get that little guy before
he gets out of this temple.</i>

1094
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:34,064
I think I better stop drinking
Varnoff's whiskey.

1095
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:43,201
Don't you ever do that again!

1096
01:14:43,278 --> 01:14:45,906
What's the idea?
Shut up!

1097
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:49,611
Did you look behind those statues?

1098
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:52,711
<i>No. The boys
will take care of that.</i>

1099
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:08,764
<i>Did you hear something?</i>

1100
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:11,772
<i>No, did you?</i>

1101
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,037
The place must be haunted.
Let's take a look around.

1102
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,317
Whoo!

1103
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:43,237
So there you are!

1104
01:15:46,808 --> 01:15:50,073
Get him!
Don't let him get away!

1105
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:52,579
Wait a minute.
I'm out of breath.

1106
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:54,980
Yeah, me too.

1107
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:57,280
I get like this
every time I run up stairs.

1108
01:15:57,352 --> 01:16:01,015
I'm a little too fat.
Okay, let's go!

1109
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:03,421
<i>Don't let him get away.
Get him, boss.</i>

1110
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:09,220
He landed on top of the tree!

1111
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:14,731
Tommy.

1112
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:21,265
Shh.

1113
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:23,538
Everything all right?
They're tied up.

1114
01:16:23,612 --> 01:16:27,639
<i>Get the small boat ready for
a getaway. I'll be right down.</i>

1115
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:29,650
<i>Keep an eye out for Tabor.</i>

1116
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:31,948
Wha...

1117
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:46,492
Oh! Oh!
Tommy!

1118
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:50,129
Tommy, are you... You
come with me, young lady.

1119
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:52,673
<i>- Come on.!
- Let me go.!</i>

1120
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:56,576
He landed in that tree? Yeah!

1121
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:58,875
Is that the tree? I don't
know. They all look alike.

1122
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:02,474
Got to find him. Yeah.
Scatter out and look for him.

1123
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:05,384
This is just about
the spot he would've...

1124
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:08,651
Bull's-eye!
Get it, Wellington.

1125
01:17:08,724 --> 01:17:10,885
Come on, Algy.
More ammunition.

1126
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:15,320
<i>Another bull's-eye.</i>

1127
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:19,527
Algy, pick me out a big heavy one.
I wanna hit him right on the head.

1128
01:17:19,601 --> 01:17:24,038
Oh, boy, Algy!
You hit him right on the head!

1129
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:27,701
What are you hitting me for?
Give me another one.

1130
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:30,506
Give it to 'em, Wellington!

1131
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:39,317
Well, I guess that's that!

1132
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:41,686
Algy, get down off the tree.

1133
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:46,827
Ow! Ow!

1134
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:49,363
Ooo-ooo-ooo!

1135
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:56,063
Algy! Algy?

1136
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:59,005
There he is.
Come on!

1137
01:17:59,074 --> 01:18:01,804
Hang on, Wellington.
I'll get you in a minute.

1138
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:12,286
Whaba!
Pretty Whaba!

1139
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:15,452
Ha-ha!
I fix you.

1140
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:26,700
<i>Algy.! Get me off
this jail horse.!</i>

1141
01:18:26,768 --> 01:18:29,862
Get me off!

1142
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:34,965
Come on, let's find him.

1143
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:37,477
He fell off right here.

1144
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:40,242
Come back!

1145
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:48,121
I can't go no further.
I gotta make a stand for it.

1146
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:51,819
Put 'em up! Come on, I'll
fight the whole five of yous.

1147
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:57,031
What's the matter?
You scared of me? Fight!

1148
01:18:57,099 --> 01:19:00,591
<i>Moolah, the hero.!
I'll fight you southpaw.</i>

1149
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:04,105
<i>Boo!</i>

1150
01:19:04,172 --> 01:19:08,006
Moolah, the hero.

1151
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:09,703
Hmm!

1152
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:21,681
Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo-whoo!

1153
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:26,957
He went the other way.
Come on, fellas!

1154
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:33,461
Wellington?
He went that way.

1155
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,294
Come on!

1156
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:39,829
It's water! How are we gonna
get across? Wait a minute.

1157
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:42,206
The river. Uh-oh.
Come here.

1158
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:45,144
What are you gonna do?
Grab a vine and follow me.

1159
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:46,942
Come on, come on!

1160
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:53,344
Wait on the other side for me!

1161
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:56,618
Here I come!

1162
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:02,655
What kind of vine is that?
What kind of...

1163
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:04,392
Okay!

1164
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:16,003
Whoo!

1165
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:21,147
<i>Stop it.!
Leave me alone.</i>

1166
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:23,275
Keep quiet!
Get this boat going.

1167
01:20:23,351 --> 01:20:26,081
Will you let Miss Joan
out of that boat?

1168
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:28,213
<i>Hey.! Hey, you.!</i>

1169
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:33,049
Preserve yourself, Miss Joan.
I'll help you.

1170
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:44,005
<i>Sharkey.!</i>

1171
01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:45,767
Closer, Sharkey, closer.

1172
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:49,072
Good boy, Sharkey.
Wait a minute.

1173
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:51,271
I gotcha. Go ahead.

1174
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:03,423
Let her go, you nasty villain!

1175
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:06,517
<i>Whaa!
Wellington?</i>

1176
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:09,257
Wellington, you'll drown!

1177
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:14,228
I don't know what I'm doing here!

1178
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:19,734
Wellington, there's
a swordfish behind you!

1179
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:22,368
<i>Look out.!</i>

1180
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:31,211
Whaa! Whaa!

1181
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:33,982
Put the boards together.

1182
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:36,285
Put 'em together!

1183
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:40,852
Whoa-oh!

1184
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:50,065
<i>Give him a short uppercut to thejaw.!</i>

1185
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:53,999
Whoo! Whoo!

1186
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:57,238
<i>Look out, Wellington.!</i>

1187
01:21:57,312 --> 01:22:00,110
Don't!
No, no, don't!

1188
01:22:00,181 --> 01:22:02,706
Oh, whoo, whoo!

1189
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:05,184
No, no!

1190
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:13,952
Go on, sock him!

1191
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:16,259
Come on, Wellington!

1192
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:18,598
Look out!

1193
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:21,369
Get this thing off me!

1194
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:32,939
Look out!
You're going the wrong way!

1195
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:42,648
Joan, you stay. I'll get you
with this eggbeater.

1196
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:45,386
I'll putt-putt-putt you
all the way in.

1197
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:47,428
Putt-putt-putt.
Putt-putt-putt.

1198
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:53,267
Moolah, you are wonderful hero.

1199
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:56,395
You saved all my people on
the island. It was nothing.

1200
01:22:56,471 --> 01:23:00,498
Here's the boat ready to
sail and where are the boys?

1201
01:23:00,575 --> 01:23:03,806
You can't expect a hero like
Wellington to run out on his public.

1202
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:06,711
He saved my life. He mopped
up Varnoff and his gang.

1203
01:23:06,781 --> 01:23:08,612
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

1204
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:13,780
Wellington, come on.
We'll miss the boat!

1205
01:23:13,855 --> 01:23:17,291
Get out of here.
Luana, cut it out!

1206
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:19,452
This is no time
for that sort of thing!

1207
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:23,019
<i>Come on.!</i>

1208
01:23:23,098 --> 01:23:27,228
Whoo-whoo!
Whoo-whoo-whoo!
