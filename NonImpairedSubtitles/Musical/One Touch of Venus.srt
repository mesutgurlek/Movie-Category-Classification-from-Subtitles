1
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,663
Hatch! Mr. Hatch!

2
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,309
Oh, yes, sir, Mr. Crest?

3
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,711
Mr. Savory wants to see you.

4
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,303
Mr. Savory?

5
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,783
Ooh, boy.

6
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,618
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Crest.

7
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,420
You will be.
Now, come on. Get going.

8
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,722
- Yes, sir.
- Don't keep Mr. Savory waiting.

9
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,257
- No, sir, I--
- He wants you to do

10
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,992
- some special work in the art gallery.
- Yes, sir.

11
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:33,745
Well, I'll just be a minute.
I'll get this right done right now.

12
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,053
There we are.

13
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,281
Excuse me, I--

14
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,473
Hatch, get a move on!

15
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,309
There we are. Now, see?

16
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,612
It's all finished now, Mr. Crest.

17
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,615
- Ow!
- Oh! I'm awfully sorry.

18
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,383
- Did I hurt you?
- Get going, Mr. Hatch.

19
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,475
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

20
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:03,258
Eddie! Eddie?

21
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,459
Oh, hi, Gloria.

22
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,661
I was just up to the model home exhibit.

23
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,163
They have the darlingest kitchen.

24
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,597
All electric.

25
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,900
Push a button and you can cook
without knowing how to cook.

26
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,568
No. Well, I'll see you later, honey.

27
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,736
Where are you going?

28
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,204
I'm going up to the Fine Arts Department.

29
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,106
Mr. Savory wants me to do
a special background

30
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,175
- on some new artwork.
- Mr. Savory?

31
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,077
Oh, gee, Eddie, did he pick you to do it?

32
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,878
Well, it's special work, Gloria.

33
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,613
Not everybody can do it.

34
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,982
Oh, Eddie, if you make
a good impression on Mr. Savory,

35
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,351
why, he might give you a raise
or a better job, and then--

36
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:31,252
Uh, yeah.

37
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,721
Well, let's talk about it
some other time, shall we?

38
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,391
Oh, Eddie. You do want
to get married, don't you?

39
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,726
Oh, of course, Gloria.
Of course. But--

40
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,546
l-I'll see you later.

41
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,585
- Oh, Mr. Hatch?
- Yes, sir?

42
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,453
Oh. Hello, Joe.

43
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,388
Hello, Eddie.
Say, Gloria was just up here.

44
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,557
- Did you meet her on the way down?
- Yeah, I saw her.

45
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,726
Hey, come on in and take a look
at the model home.

46
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,394
Gloria was crazy about it.

47
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,696
Oh, well, she would be.

48
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,498
She's practically in her
wedding veil every minute.

49
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,867
One false move from me,
and I'm going to be on my honeymoon.

50
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,802
Aw, Gloria's a wonderful girl, Eddie.

51
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,404
Oh, well, I know she is,
but she's so terribly one-track-minded.

52
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,140
Why, even when we have dinner together,

53
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,698
the only thing she ever eats is rice.

54
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,011
Holy mackerel, it's closing time.

55
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,880
Look, Joe, I'm going to
have to work late tonight,

56
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,315
so will you pick up Gloria for me
and take her to Tony's?

57
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,383
- Sure, I will.
- All right.

58
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,018
And I'll get there as soon as I can.

59
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,134
- Oh, and save me some spumoni.
- Sure.

60
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,860
Closing time, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:49,631
You've been after this Venus statue
a long time, haven't you, Mr. Savory?

62
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,300
Ever since I opened
the art gallery here in the store,

63
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,637
it's been my dream to add
the Anatolian Venus to my collection.

64
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,138
What did this dream set you back?

65
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,706
Well, let's put it this way:

66
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,009
the store will not declare
a dividend this year.

67
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:05,313
Please! Must we talk dollars and cents
about this priceless piece?

68
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,615
The last "priceless" on it was 200,000.

69
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,217
- 200,000?
- Wow!

70
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,219
Did you get someone to fix those drapes?

71
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,388
Yes. Eddie Hatch.
He'll be here any minute.

72
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,823
He's a good boy.
He's been with us for eight years.

73
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,492
There he is.

74
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,228
Is the statue for sale, Mr. Savory?

75
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,063
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Miss Grant.

76
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,532
Mr. Savory sent for me.
Must be pretty important.

77
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,901
Yes, he wants you to fix the drapes
in front of the statue.

78
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,903
It jams when you pull the cord.

79
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,306
- You fix, huh?
- Is that all?

80
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,007
Well, that's all for now, Eddie.

81
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,576
- Hurry it up, will you?
- Yes, Miss Grant.

82
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:35,710
- Good boy.
- Oh, Miss Grant.

83
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,912
- May I have one, please?
- Oh, certainly.

84
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,505
Oh, wait a minute.
The good side.

85
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,684
To Venus, the goddess of love.

86
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,554
May she stay on the job
and take care of all of us.

87
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,755
- To Venus.
- To Venus.

88
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,848
Whitfield, darling!

89
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,526
Hello, Barbara.

90
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,329
What is all this about a certain
most eligible bachelor

91
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:31,032
falling in love with a statue?

92
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,785
Perhaps, my dear,
she reminds me of you.

93
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,705
Yeah. They both have large pedestals.

94
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,743
Whitfield. You remember
my daughter Brenda?

95
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,811
Not little Brenda?

96
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,281
You've, um, grown, Brenda.

97
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,149
Hatch is waiting, chief.
He finished the drapes.

98
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:51,586
Oh, excuse me.

99
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,988
Whitfield hasn't seen Brenda
since she was a child.

100
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,657
He used to bounce her on his knee.

101
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,425
Well, bully for Brenda.

102
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,314
I've been his secretary for 10 years
and I haven't made it yet.

103
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,253
Pardon me.

104
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,919
Now, we'll see if it works easily.

105
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,013
You see? It jams there.

106
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,282
Yes, sir.

107
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,284
I don't know what could
have happened to it, I--

108
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,787
I want that material to go up smoothly

109
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,722
so that the statue
will be revealed dramatically.

110
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,157
- Yes, sir.
- Now, use your head, Hatch.

111
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,660
I don't want to have to fumble with that rope
like a fool in front of all my friends.

112
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,395
No, sir. I'll take care of it, sir.

113
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,264
Hurry up.

114
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,788
Yes, sir.

115
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,629
Oh, Mr. Savory.
You forgot your--

116
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,927
Golly, you're beautiful.

117
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:50,084
Please! How can I fix this
if you don't stand still?

118
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:04,318
I'm all right. I'm all right.

119
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:07,810
Just a little overworked,
maybe, but I'm all right.

120
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,849
You're moving!

121
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,331
Was it you who kissed me?

122
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,468
You're talking! You're alive!

123
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,069
Well, of course I'm alive.

124
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,438
What did you think I was?

125
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,794
Well, I'm not very bright,
I... thought you were a statue.

126
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,744
Excuse um-- Brandy!

127
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,280
Smelling salts!
Spirits of ammonia!

128
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,049
Poor mortal. Are you frightened?

129
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,471
Frightened?

130
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,654
I don't know the meaning of the word.

131
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,824
Why, you darling.
You are frightened.

132
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,884
Well, just from the toes up.

133
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,512
Come here.

134
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:53,016
Come here to me.
Close to me.

135
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,666
Oh, he's wonderful.

136
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,531
Thank you, Jupiter.

137
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,690
There, that's better.

138
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,059
What? How did I get out here?

139
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,061
I brought you out. Fresh air.

140
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,086
Oh, thanks.

141
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,434
I guess I fainted, didn't I?

142
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,304
I-- I was working on the draperies
around the statue,

143
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,406
and all of a sudden
I had the strangest feeling,

144
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,141
some kind of a delirium.

145
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,677
I dreamed that the statue came to life.

146
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,246
It spoke to me.

147
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,381
- Isn't that silly?
- How do you feel now?

148
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,750
Oh, I feel much better, thank you.

149
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,137
Just rest.

150
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,254
There, isn't that nice?

151
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,279
Oh, that's wonderful.

152
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,225
Oh, I--

153
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:55,411
Excuse me, but I...
get back to my dr--

154
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,166
It was you! The statue!

155
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,369
- Well, of course.
- You came to life!

156
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,038
Now, don't ask a lot of questions.
You'll only get confused.

157
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,374
Get confused?

158
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,477
I'm spinning like a merry-go-round.

159
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:10,745
Look--

160
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,613
Look, let's get this straight.

161
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,116
Just a few minutes ago,
you were cold marble.

162
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,617
Yes, you were!
I could feel you!

163
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:17,885
Please!

164
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,120
And now you're--

165
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,788
And now?

166
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,557
Don't come near me.
I'll scream.

167
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,525
Oh, aren't you ashamed?

168
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,861
A big boy like you
scared to death of a girl.

169
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,330
Yeah, but you're not a girl.
You're a statue.

170
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,198
Are you a betting man?

171
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:34,969
Well... you were a statue.

172
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,771
Oh, look, I don't understand any of this.

173
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:37,972
Who are you?

174
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,565
I am Venus, daughter of Jupiter,
goddess of love.

175
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,842
Oh, I'm very glad to know you.

176
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:45,112
My name is Hatch,
Eddie Hatch, Display De--

177
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,481
- Goddess of what?
- Love.

178
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,584
The word seems to displease you.

179
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,985
Oh, no, Your Majesty, it's just that--

180
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,387
Call me Venus.

181
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,289
Venus.

182
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:56,847
Could I go now?

183
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,859
You don't want to stay here with me

184
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,128
in the moonlight... alone?

185
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:05,066
Well, if you won't think
it's impertinent, frankly, no.

186
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,767
See, uh-- Excuse me.

187
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,437
It's just that some friends of mine
are waiting for me for dinner.

188
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,539
The little Italian place, Tony's.

189
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,074
They might be worried about me.

190
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,543
Sounds charming.
I will go with you.

191
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,602
Oh, no, no.
You wouldn't like it.

192
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,247
They don't cater very much to goddesses.

193
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,749
Well, see you around.

194
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:25,071
...Venus who started the Trojan War
with "I love you."

195
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:31,772
Some of you may recall the myth
that Jupiter once breathed life

196
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,828
into the chiseled perfection
of this masterpiece.

197
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:37,832
But in the 20th century,
that's not worthwhile discussing.

198
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:42,637
In fact, the beauty of face and form
which I'm about to reveal is such

199
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,806
that the 20th century
would seem a little unworthy.

200
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,141
Oh, what a nice man.

201
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,477
Yeah. That's Mr. Savory.

202
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:53,314
He's my boss.
He owns the store.

203
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,516
As some of you may know...

204
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,632
There isn't gonna be any statue there!

205
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,153
- That's right.
- You're the statue!

206
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,388
Yeah, but what about Mr. Savory?

207
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,422
He left me in charge!

208
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,091
He's gonna think I'm responsible!

209
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,184
But no words of mine can do justice

210
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,696
to what I want you now to behold.

211
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,232
My good friends, lovers of art,

212
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,291
the matchless Anatolian Venus.

213
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,296
Well, you're just full of surprises.

214
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,684
It's gone! My statue, it's not here!

215
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,486
- This isn't a gag?
- Gag? It's been stolen!

216
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,045
- Hatch! Hatch!
- That's me.

217
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,242
Where's that idiot window trimmer!

218
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,763
Don't be afraid.

219
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,482
You're above mere mortals
like this department store owner.

220
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,035
You're now under the protection
of the Olympian gods.

221
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,685
Yeah? Well, supposing he fires me.

222
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,888
What are you gonna do?

223
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,874
Make a patron saint
of the window trimmers?

224
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,933
They'll hear you.

225
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,860
Mr. Savory's timing is a little off today.

226
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,682
The cart before the horse, so to speak.

227
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,150
He kills me!

228
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,902
I'll let you know
when the horse gets back.

229
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,102
- We'll have another unveiling.
- Molly!

230
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,837
I'm sorry you made this trip for nothing.

231
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,623
Molly!

232
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,181
Coming, sire.

233
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,249
- Bye, Shirley.
- Good-bye.

234
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:14,862
Call the Kerrigan Detective Agency.

235
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,579
- Tell them I want their best men.
- All right.

236
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,999
- No! Mr. Kerrigan personally!
- It shall be done.

237
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,217
Years of work, endless patient search,

238
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,294
fabulous expense, and then just gone.

239
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,740
Do you want me to advertise
a reward for Eddie Hatch, too?

240
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,923
Not for him.

241
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,476
Just for his head on a pikestaff.

242
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,777
Now, be reasonable, chief.

243
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,747
You don't think Eddie walked out of here
with that statue under his arm, do you?

244
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,583
When I left him there, there was
a great work of art on that pedestal.

245
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,335
I hold him responsible.

246
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,740
Hallelujah.

247
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:43,824
Well, that's that.

248
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,660
Oh, you think so?

249
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,195
Didn't you hear Mr. Savory?

250
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,311
He holds me responsible.

251
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,084
What if he takes the price
of the statue out of my pay?

252
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,671
$200,000, and I make $43.75 a week?

253
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,040
Why, that's-- Let's see, that's--

254
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,475
87 years.

255
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,192
The twinkling of an eye.

256
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:06,647
Besides, I shall wait a hundred,
a thousand if necessary.

257
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:07,796
Oh, no, you won't.

258
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,216
You've got me into enough trouble.

259
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:10,684
The only thing you can do for me

260
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,334
is to get back up on your pedestal
and leave me alone.

261
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,071
You do not want me?

262
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,841
You're turning me away?

263
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:19,473
Very well. Go.
Go to your friends.

264
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:22,878
Oh, I will!

265
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,398
But what about you?

266
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,267
You can't stay out here on the balcony.

267
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,360
You'll freeze in that...

268
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,654
in what you're wearing.

269
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,490
I'll be all right.

270
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,508
Why don't you go inside and get up
on your nice warm pedestal--

271
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,101
I'll stay here.

272
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,262
Well... all right.
If that's what you want.

273
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,338
Good night.

274
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,463
Say, Gloria, Eddie may be a long time.
You better eat something.

275
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:12,947
Oh, I can't, I'm too nervous.

276
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,983
I just can't wait to find out
what's happened.

277
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,871
You know, I bet Mr. Savory
put Eddie in charge

278
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,274
of window dressing in the entire store.

279
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,190
Eddie has wonderful ideas
about dressing windows.

280
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,093
He didn't get his diploma
from correspondence school for nothing.

281
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,446
Eddie's a pretty smart fellow, all right.

282
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,496
You know, Joe, you ought
to be a success, too.

283
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:30,815
You work hard.

284
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,583
Someday Mr. Savory will notice you,

285
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,989
and you'll get a promotion, too.

286
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:39,029
But remember: stay in there pitching,
and you'll get ahead.

287
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,791
I don't know, Gloria.

288
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,843
You do want to be a success, don't you?

289
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,378
Yeah, but...

290
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,199
Hey, Eddie. Over here.

291
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,306
What happened?

292
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,702
We thought you'd gotten
lost or something.

293
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,776
- How was the unveiling?
- Oh, it was awful.

294
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,220
The statue disappeared.

295
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,336
I mean, Mr. Savory thinks it disappeared.

296
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,642
But you didn't have
anything to do with it, did you?

297
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:58,772
Who, me?

298
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,413
What's wrong, Eddie?

299
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:02,611
What's my name?

300
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,222
Come on, tell me!
What's my name?

301
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,266
Eddie Hatch.

302
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,882
Oh, that's right.
Eddie Hatch.

303
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,460
My name is Eddie Hatch.

304
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,689
I work in the Display Department
at Savory's Department Store.

305
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,061
You see? I know my name
and I know where I work.

306
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,292
I'm sane!

307
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:17,561
I'm as sane as anybody!

308
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,965
Well, of you course you're sane, Eddie.

309
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,662
Naturally you're sane.
Isn't he, Gloria?

310
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,000
I don't know.

311
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,551
What's all this about a statue?
And what happened to it?

312
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,200
And how did you get mixed up in it?

313
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,643
I don't know, Gloria.
I mean, I'm not sure.

314
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,215
Anyway, Mr. Savory holds me responsible.

315
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,339
I heard him say so.

316
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:33,951
But how did it disappear?

317
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,497
Yeah, a statue just doesn't get up
and walk away, Eddie.

318
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,385
That's right.

319
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,151
That's ridiculous.

320
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,556
I've got nothing to worry about.

321
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,389
I'm in good shape.

322
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,020
Eddie!

323
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,325
You're in great shape.

324
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,335
Your name Hatch?

325
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,769
That's me. Why?

326
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,317
Gotta ask you a lot of questions, Hatch.

327
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,706
- Come on.
- Say, what's all this?

328
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,539
- Police.
- Where are you taking him?

329
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,271
- What's he done?
- Taking him back to the store.

330
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,781
Mr. Savory wants to see him
about a little $200,000 statue

331
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,011
that climbed down and walked away.

332
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,212
That's right!
How did you know?

333
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,913
Aw, come on!

334
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,490
See you later, Gloria.

335
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,559
- See you later, Joe.
- So long, Eddie.

336
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,398
Come here to me.
Come close to me.

337
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,085
Okay, okay, go on.

338
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,973
But I've already done it a hundred times.

339
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,670
Go on! Go on!
Show me from the start.

340
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,838
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

341
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,186
I was here.

342
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,117
Show me again.

343
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:49,370
How can I fix this if you don't stand still?

344
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:52,206
Then all of a sudden I was down here.

345
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,822
You're talking! You're alive!

346
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,636
Of course I'm alive.

347
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,487
Then I was here.

348
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,522
He's still sticking to that story.

349
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,723
He'll crack.

350
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,525
I've dealt with these
clever shoplifters before.

351
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,526
Pretty clever.

352
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:16,797
He pretended a thousand-pound statue
was an elk's tooth and just wore it out.

353
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,166
- I know he had help.
- Probably a couple of elks.

354
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,467
Oh, very funny.

355
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,703
But I've got one of his accomplices
lined up right now.

356
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,238
But this guy had access to the store.

357
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,407
- He's the ringleader.
- Oh, lay off!

358
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,776
Hatch couldn't be leader
in Ring Around the Rosie.

359
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,211
I'm paying Kerrigan
to be the detective, Molly.

360
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,614
Well, buy him some badge polish
and send him home.

361
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,116
Anyone can tell this boy isn't a thief.

362
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,018
Come on, Eddie.

363
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:41,188
I'll catch you a couple of flies
and you can pull their wings off.

364
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,123
Now you go on home and get some rest.

365
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,926
Come here to me.
Come close to me.

366
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,428
Take it easy, Eddie.

367
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:50,064
I might take you up on that later.

368
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,886
He's plenty smart,
but I'll keep my eye on him.

369
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,275
Pulse is okay.

370
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,799
Let's see now.

371
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,613
Temperature's normal.

372
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,582
See, Eddie? You're all right.

373
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,884
Don't pay any attention
to that crooked thermometer!

374
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,019
I must have a fever!

375
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,887
Oh, nonsense.
You're just upset.

376
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,156
With that Savory and that
dopey detective and--

377
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,491
Oh, I'm so sick!

378
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,260
Look-- Look, Eddie,
I'll run a bath for you.

379
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,996
We'll got to Tony's and get Eddie
some nourishing soup.

380
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,832
Minestrone, your favorite.

381
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,133
You didn't have any dinner.

382
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,569
Oh, yeah.
I must be weak from hunger.

383
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,719
We'll be right back.
Come on, Gloria.

384
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,699
Don't-- Don't let the water run over.

385
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:50,023
You're-- You're talking.
You're alive.

386
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:52,082
Come to me.
Come close to me.

387
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,101
Oh, no!

388
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:14,648
What are you doing here?

389
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,216
You can't come in! Please!

390
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:17,317
Why not?

391
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,854
Well, because my girl's coming right back!

392
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:22,823
She's very jealous, you know?

393
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,425
She's like a wildcat when she gets angry.

394
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,860
She's 8 feet tall,

395
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,695
and she's got very sharp fingernails.

396
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,297
Silly boy.
What can she do to me?

397
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,966
Well, I don't know,
but she can do plenty to me!

398
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,268
Please go away.

399
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,969
You sound henpecked.
Poor boy.

400
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:38,372
I'll bet she runs your life
like an assembly line.

401
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,175
And how. Why, even--

402
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,476
Nothing of the sort!

403
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,611
She's sweet!
She's a very nice girl!

404
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,380
Well, I'm a very nice girl.

405
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,783
Oh, please, please, be reasonable,
Miss-- Miss Venus.

406
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,818
I'm not worth bothering about.

407
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:53,687
I'm not famous. I'm not rich.

408
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,622
I'm not even very bright.

409
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:56,890
I'm not bright!

410
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:00,627
In fact, there's insanity in my family,
starting with me tonight!

411
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:01,719
I'm crazy!

412
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,235
You-- You must have me mixed up
with somebody else.

413
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,938
I'm just a little old good-for-nothing
window trimmer.

414
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:13,173
You can be anything you want to be.

415
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:14,474
Can I be alone?

416
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,510
I'll leave, if you'll go with me.

417
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,445
Oh, no.
No, please go away.

418
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,647
My-- My landlady, you know,
she wouldn't understand.

419
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,049
She's-- She's got a rule.

420
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,183
Against me?

421
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:26,286
No! About girls being with boys.

422
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,276
Why, there's even a law against it!

423
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,893
Is this your landlady?

424
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,494
Oh, no, no, no!

425
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:35,862
Hello?

426
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,398
Hello, Gloria.
I was just talking about you.

427
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:42,536
That is... to myself.

428
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:43,804
I had quite a little chat.

429
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,973
Me and-- and me.

430
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,641
He's talking to himself.

431
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:48,809
That's bad.

432
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,644
Look, darling, keep calm.

433
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,446
Listen, they're all out of minestrone.

434
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,414
You could have either noodle or spinach.

435
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,950
Noodle or spinach?

436
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,952
- Noodle.
- Spinach.

437
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,254
- Noodle!
- Spinach!

438
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,745
- Noodle!
- Don't bother me!

439
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:06,159
Who's bothering you?
I'm only trying to help!

440
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:07,828
What?

441
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,181
What do you mean?

442
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,533
I'd be glad to leave you alone!

443
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,535
- Gloria.
- I heard a woman!

444
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,638
- Not in our room!
- Well, it wasn't the zoo!

445
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,573
Wait a minute.
Wait till I get the package.

446
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,097
Come on, I've had enough of this.

447
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,844
Who-- Who is it?

448
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,445
It's me. I want to come in.

449
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,648
It's my landlady. This way.

450
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,173
Over here.

451
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:35,055
Oh, that's no good!
Over here!

452
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,724
Mr. Hatch! Mr. Hatch!

453
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,059
One moment, Mrs. Gogarty.

454
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:42,296
Mr. Hatch!

455
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,930
Open up this very instant!

456
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,546
Coming, Mrs. Gogarty, coming!

457
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,103
Miss Venus? Miss--
Where are you?

458
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:52,321
Here I am.
She'll never find me here.

459
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,679
Not in here! Quick!
Get out, please!

460
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,681
Hurry! Get behind the screen!

461
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:03,150
I'm coming in, Mr. Hatch!

462
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,786
Oh, of course,
Mrs. Gogarty, of course!

463
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,354
You've got a woman in this room.

464
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,556
Why, Mrs. Gogarty, what an idea!

465
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:10,824
Whatever the idea, you know the rules.

466
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,192
You've got to both get out!

467
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,260
What's behind that screen?

468
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,095
Dirty dishes.

469
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,396
Kindly remove it.

470
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,700
Oh, Mrs. Gogarty,
I had to give her a square meal.

471
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:23,158
I said to myself, "Well, Mrs. Gogarty,
with her kind heart--"

472
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,809
There. You see?
There's nobody here.

473
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,378
Oh, Mrs. Gogarty, there's nothing
in there but a sink and a tub

474
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,595
and things like that.

475
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,884
So you take them, too!

476
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,319
- What?
- I adore bubble baths.

477
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:40,520
I take them all the time,

478
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,170
especially those ones
with the lovely jasmine smell.

479
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,026
Odor of Pine Tar.

480
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,928
- My husband uses that.
- He does?

481
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,229
Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Hatch,

482
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,098
but you know one can't be
too careful these days.

483
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,532
No, no. Well, good night, Mrs. Gogarty.

484
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,334
- Good night.
- Good night.

485
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:57,189
- Love that smell.
- Yes. Good night.

486
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,212
Miss Venus!

487
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,313
Your Majesty!

488
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:08,815
- Miss Venus!
- Here I am! Is she gone?

489
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,951
Oh, my gosh!
Get out of there, quick!

490
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,520
Oh, no! No! Wait a minute!

491
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,408
And get dressed in a hurry!

492
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:23,930
Open the door, Eddie Hatch!

493
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:26,433
Oh, honest, Gloria, Eddie wouldn't
do anything like that to you.

494
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:27,434
And get away with it.

495
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:30,084
Hurry! Hurry!

496
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,006
Come and get your soup!

497
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:34,189
It's hot!

498
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,743
- Hur--
- Did I help?

499
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,345
Yes, yes. You were wonderful.

500
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,994
Come on.

501
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,308
Eddie! Open the door!

502
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,592
See, Gloria?
There's no woman here.

503
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,127
There's no Eddie, either.

504
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,262
That phony!

505
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,597
Pretending he's sick just to get rid of me!

506
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,233
Boy, wait till the next time I see him.

507
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:02,758
He won't have to pretend.

508
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,603
Gloria, there wouldn't be anybody in there.

509
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,160
Moonlight Madness?

510
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:29,763
$40 an ounce! Smell!

511
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,165
- It's worth it.
- Worth it?

512
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,882
Now wait a minute!

513
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,619
Oh, Gloria.

514
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:42,108
Now take it easy.

515
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,377
I chase around worrying
about his health,

516
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:47,080
and he just chases around!

517
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,332
You don't understand.
A lot of things could've happened.

518
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:05,832
Eddie--

519
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,134
Quiet. You want
the watchman to hear us?

520
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,637
- He won't bother us.
- He certainly will.

521
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,039
Don't you realize I'm breaking
into the store?

522
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,342
I'll turn him into an owl.

523
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,743
- A what?
- An owl.

524
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:17,777
It's very easy.

525
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:20,113
I just go like that, and he's an owl.

526
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:21,728
Oh, come on!

527
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,544
Excuse me.

528
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,552
It's locked.

529
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,807
Now what am I gonna do?

530
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,366
Well, haven't you got any ideas?

531
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:52,979
Look, it's late.

532
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:55,849
You've got to have someplace to stay.

533
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:58,135
Don't you ever want to go to sleep?

534
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,174
Come on.

535
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,286
You see, I trust you, Eddie.

536
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,757
Come on.

537
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,546
What's wrong now?

538
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:02,449
Aren't you gonna carry me
over the threshold?

539
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,634
Why do you keep acting
as if we were on our honeymoon?

540
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,823
Oh, all right!

541
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:10,824
You stay here tonight.

542
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,025
You'll be nice and comfortable.

543
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,913
I'll get you out in the morning.

544
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,636
Oh, it's lovely.

545
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,205
Oh, well, this is the very latest thing.

546
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,308
Now, everything is operated
through this master control.

547
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,910
Now, there's the radio and the bed

548
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,646
and the air conditioning and the kitchen.

549
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,180
Show me how it works.

550
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:37,150
Well, I'll turn on the radio.

551
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:41,211
We'll have to wait a little while,
you know, for it to warm up.

552
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,675
The beds!

553
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,545
I must have pushed the wrong button.

554
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:59,239
Well, I did! It was marked "radio."

555
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,107
Here, we'll try this one.

556
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,476
Now it should work.

557
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,125
Oh! I--

558
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:21,479
There must be a short circuit someplace.

559
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:24,631
You know what?

560
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,533
It's getting late, and you better
be getting some sleep.

561
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,734
But I'm wide awake.

562
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,936
Oh, no, you're not.
You're sleepy.

563
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:32,372
You're-- You're very sleepy.

564
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,674
Close your eyes.

565
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,710
You want to sleep.

566
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,531
Sleep. Sleep.

567
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,124
That's no good.
I'm hypnotizing myself.

568
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,959
Oh, Eddie, you're so cute.

569
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,728
I'm not cute.

570
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,496
Why, I'm a beast!

571
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,298
I'm terrible when you get to know me.

572
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,666
Ask Gloria.

573
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,669
No, no, no, don't ask Gloria.

574
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,637
Oh, why are you messing up my life?

575
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,674
I was a dependable,
respectable citizen until tonight.

576
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,733
Were you having any fun?

577
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,646
That's all you think about is fun.

578
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,082
That's all right for you
flying around on Mount Olympus

579
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,885
or wherever you come from
without a care in the world,

580
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,620
but down here it's different.

581
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:22,440
We're practical and efficient.

582
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,212
Why, we've perfected a machine here--

583
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,596
What have I done?

584
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,197
You kissed me.

585
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:32,532
You made me do that.

586
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:34,134
That's not fair.
You tricked me.

587
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,835
You used some kind of a spell on me.

588
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,605
No, Eddie, I wouldn't do that.

589
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,740
You mean I wanted to?

590
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,594
I hope so.

591
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,747
Well, as I was saying, the...

592
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:51,117
There's another button here that...

593
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,020
turns on the automatic stove.

594
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:58,525
You can cook a whole meal
by remote control just by...

595
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,593
by pushing that button.

596
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,896
How do you fall in love?

597
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:04,898
In love?

598
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,734
To the music of harps and flutes?

599
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,918
Flutes?

600
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:23,183
So that's how you fall in love.

601
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,419
Speak low

602
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:29,945
When you speak love

603
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:34,294
Our summer day withers away

604
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:38,464
Too soon, too soon

605
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:41,334
Speak low

606
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,838
When you speak love

607
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,808
Our moment is swift like ships adrift

608
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:52,745
We're swept apart too soon

609
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,216
Speak low

610
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:59,919
Darling, speak low

611
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:04,090
Love is a spark lost in the dark

612
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:08,174
Too soon, too soon

613
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,964
I fear

614
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:14,547
Wherever I go

615
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:18,771
That tomorrow is near,
tomorrow is here

616
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:23,443
And always too soon

617
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:26,613
Time is so old

618
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:30,316
And love so brief

619
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,842
Love is pure gold

620
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:38,057
And time a thief

621
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,674
We're late

622
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:45,465
Darling, we're late

623
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,969
The curtain descends, everything ends

624
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:54,053
Too soon, too soon

625
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,910
I wait

626
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:01,972
Darling, I wait

627
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:09,535
Will you speak low to me?

628
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:22,392
Speak low

629
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:25,872
When you speak love

630
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:30,024
Our summer day withers away

631
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:33,780
Too soon, too soon

632
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,840
Speak low

633
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:40,586
When you speak love

634
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:44,670
Our moment is swift like ships adrift

635
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:48,494
We're swept apart too soon

636
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:51,679
Speak low

637
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:55,568
Darling, speak low

638
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:59,872
Love is a spark lost in the dark

639
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:04,696
Too soon, too soon

640
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:24,178
Time is so old

641
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:27,758
And love so brief

642
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,918
Love is pure gold

643
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:35,274
And time a thief

644
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,926
We're late

645
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,528
Darling, we're late

646
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,984
The curtain descends

647
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:48,545
Everything ends

648
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:53,139
Too soon, too soon

649
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:56,879
I wait

650
00:35:57,021 --> 00:36:04,621
Darling, I wait

651
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:08,041
Will you speak low

652
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:12,262
Will you speak low

653
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:19,900
To me?

654
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:24,146
Sunday papers here!

655
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,648
Get your Sunday morning papers!

656
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,245
Get your Sunday papers here!

657
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:32,913
Papers!

658
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,969
Hello, Stammers.
Where's the great white father?

659
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:48,481
He's with the detective.
In the bedroom, miss.

660
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:50,767
He'll find plenty of clues in there.

661
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:51,966
Hi, gumshoe.

662
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:53,667
Your handcuffs are showing.

663
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,807
- Open up, sire.
- Come on in, Molly.

664
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:03,729
Try every school and university in Europe.

665
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:06,448
The guy I want is an old professor
named Ludavicci Fassoli.

666
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,354
I met him once in Prague.

667
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,803
He must be 90 if he's alive.

668
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,738
He's the author of a famous volume called

669
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:17,061
<i>The Strange Legends and Myths</i>
<i>Surrounding the Anatolian Venus.</i>

670
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:19,512
What do I care what it costs?
I want some action on this!

671
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,696
Right. Well, keep in touch.

672
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,568
Had a chat with Kerrigan.

673
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,301
He's been looking into Hatch's background.

674
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,036
How'd you sleep last night?

675
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,056
- Not a wink.
- I didn't think so.

676
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:33,241
At least it took your mind
off cold marble for a while.

677
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:35,579
Just what is that supposed to mean?

678
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,598
The little bundle tucked away
in the model home.

679
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:42,022
She should be a sensation
during January clearance sales.

680
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,626
What on Earth are you talking about?

681
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,753
I've got to hand it to you.
She's an eyeful.

682
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,330
You mean there's a girl downstairs?

683
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,400
Look, this is Molly.

684
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,779
Who is she?
Somebody I know?

685
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,098
Yeah, Goldilocks.

686
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,150
She ate the porridge
and now she snoozes

687
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,903
under the model sheets
on the model bed in the model home.

688
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,272
We'll see about that!

689
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,007
I'm not running a motel
for homeless girls.

690
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,913
Hey, boss, wait for me!

691
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,998
It's no fire, boss,

692
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,114
just a simple, old-fashioned eviction.

693
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:15,247
She'll still be there.

694
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,303
Only long enough for me
to throw her out bodily.

695
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:19,521
The idea of a woman
breaking into Savory's.

696
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,291
So unnecessary.

697
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:11,737
Don't you want to wake--

698
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,435
Molly...

699
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,221
That girl, she...

700
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,829
she reminds me of someone.

701
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:28,674
Yeah? I wish she reminded me of me.

702
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:32,778
She's the most beautiful creature
I've ever seen.

703
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:35,281
Molly, I've always been
able to count on you.

704
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:36,882
This time you must not fail me.

705
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,736
On your honor?

706
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:39,919
Don't wake her.

707
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:44,757
When she does get up,
her dreams must come true.

708
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:48,327
Get flowers, clothes, jewelry, everything.

709
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:50,930
Promise me?

710
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,079
I'll be right back.

711
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,721
Good morning.

712
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,656
Oh, hello, Joe.

713
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,125
- Where are you going so early?
- Out.

714
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,294
Hey, Eddie, what happened last night?

715
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:56,929
When Gloria and I came back,
you were gone.

716
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,964
Where'd you go?

717
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,734
Look, Joe, there's something
I got to talk to you about.

718
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:04,885
You're my best friend, aren't you?

719
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:07,707
Well, I'm not so sure, Eddie.

720
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,675
Well, I can trust you, can't I, Joe?

721
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,811
Look, Eddie...

722
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,346
there's something you've just got to know.

723
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,648
It's Gloria.

724
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,450
Yeah, it's Gloria.

725
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,085
But it was the music or something--

726
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,553
Yeah, the music.

727
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,022
It-- It did something to you.

728
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,292
All of a sudden, for no reason,
you found yourself kissing her.

729
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,060
Yeah, that's right.

730
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:29,662
But remember, it wasn't her fault.

731
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:30,963
Oh, yes, it was, Joe.

732
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:33,132
She-- She does something to you.

733
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:36,035
- She sure does.
- Oh, thanks, Joe.

734
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,570
You're a pal. You understand.

735
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,705
You won't tell Gloria
anything about it, will you?

736
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,742
Me? Gloria? Understand what?

737
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:46,245
About my kissing the statue.
She wouldn't understand.

738
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,880
Eddie, you kissed a statue?

739
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,483
Well, she wasn't a statue then.

740
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:51,684
Who wasn't a statue?

741
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,285
Venus, of course!

742
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,388
She was here last night.
She took a bubble bath.

743
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,189
You gave a statue a bubble bath?

744
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:59,692
Oh, no, Joe, she took it herself.
I didn't give it to her.

745
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,794
Look, Eddie, I think your fever's
coming back or something.

746
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:04,597
I've got to get back to the model home
and get her out of bed!

747
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,986
Look, Eddie--
Wait for me.

748
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:12,238
Don't worry about having me
come down today, Miss Grant.

749
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,372
I don't mind.

750
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,808
He'd get the sultan out of bed.

751
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:19,178
Well, I guess these rags are the gladdest.

752
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:22,114
I hope you won't get into any trouble
doing all these things for me.

753
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,717
He told me to give you anything you need.

754
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:27,675
From where I stand,
you don't need a thing.

755
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,124
You know, the funniest thing
happened to me last night.

756
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,193
Me, too.

757
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:35,761
I was out with someone.

758
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:36,962
Oh? Your sweetheart?

759
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:39,465
Oh, no. That's what's so funny.

760
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,333
He was just a friend.

761
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,869
But all of a sudden--

762
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:45,271
He was the right one.

763
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,240
I just meet the wrong ones.

764
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:51,477
I just can't figure it out.

765
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:54,980
One day you're out with someone
who isn't anybody special,

766
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:58,784
and then he makes you feel
like everybody else is...

767
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,640
well... nobody.

768
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:09,829
You know the way you feel

769
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:13,032
When there is autumn in the air

770
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:15,468
That's him

771
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,270
That's him

772
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,639
The way you feel when Antoine

773
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,275
Has finished with your hair

774
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,811
That's him

775
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,279
That's him.

776
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:30,015
You know the way you feel

777
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,952
When you smell fresh bread baking

778
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:37,923
The way you feel when
your aching back stops aching.

779
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:40,359
Wonderful world

780
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,995
Wonderful you

781
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,730
That's him

782
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:45,965
That's him.

783
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,399
That's him.

784
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:52,204
He's simple as a breeze
that blows in summer

785
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:56,475
He's natural... not actory.

786
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,331
He's like a plumber
when you need a plumber.

787
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,085
He's satisfactory

788
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:09,188
You know the way you feel at movies

789
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,957
When the lights grow dimmer

790
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:13,893
The way you feel when overnight

791
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:16,929
your hips grow slimmer.

792
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:21,767
Wonderful world, wonderful you

793
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:23,869
- Say!
- <i>C'est</i> Paris!

794
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,372
Say New York, Savory.

795
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,174
In the darkest caves and hallways

796
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:32,044
I would know him always

797
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:36,615
'Cause I would see
that he's the one for me

798
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,951
How could I pass by him

799
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:41,520
When I'd identify him

800
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:44,089
So easily?

801
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:45,891
Because that's he!

802
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:50,563
You know the way you feel
about the "Rhapsody In Blue"

803
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,264
His eyes are blue.

804
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:53,999
His eyes are brown.

805
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,769
His are on the town.

806
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:58,837
The way you feel about a hat

807
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:01,340
created just for you.

808
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:02,955
That's him.

809
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:05,945
That's him.

810
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,880
He's Christmas

811
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:09,081
He's caviar.

812
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,784
He's a Coke with cherry

813
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:14,153
Let's face it, girls, he's a man.

814
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:17,723
He's necessary

815
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:20,392
Wonderful world

816
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:23,362
Wonderful you

817
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,364
That's him

818
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,099
That's him

819
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,851
- That's him.
- That's him.

820
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:34,139
- That's that.
- Oops! No shoes.

821
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:36,675
Okay, my little quarterback,
you're still carrying the ball.

822
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,611
Shoe department, size 4-1/2.

823
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,146
4-1/2? Ridiculous.

824
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:42,715
Well, the stage is set.

825
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,171
I'll go get Romeo.

826
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:07,988
Hey, Eddie!

827
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:10,843
Look-- Look, Eddie,

828
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:13,112
I don't really think you're,
well, crazy or anything.

829
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:14,413
I just think you're a little overworked.

830
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:17,750
I'm gonna be all right just as soon
as I can get her out of here.

831
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,119
But why did you bring a girl
up here in the first place?

832
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:21,587
Oh, Joe! Don't ask me any questions.

833
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:23,255
I don't know the answers myself.

834
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,257
- Look, Joe, you're my pal, aren't you?
- Yeah.

835
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:27,626
Well, you stay here.
And if anybody comes, you be my lookout.

836
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:28,727
Give me a whistle or something.

837
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:31,377
- Give me a warning.
- Oh, look, Eddie--

838
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:38,270
Venus?

839
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,039
Your Majesty?

840
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:42,428
Venus, where are y--

841
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,377
This is no time for games.

842
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:49,048
Of all the dresses you gave me,
I like this one the best.

843
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:51,784
Dresses? I gave you?

844
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:54,019
You don't like it?

845
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,289
Of course not!
I'll be fired! Take it off!

846
00:46:57,414 --> 00:46:59,692
I'm in enough trouble al--

847
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,394
Take it off?

848
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:03,729
- Hi, Gloria.
- Hi, Joe.

849
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,879
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I'm going to the model home.

850
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:10,369
Come on! You've got to--

851
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,671
What are you doing?

852
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:14,006
What are you--
What are you doing?

853
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:15,174
You didn't like it.

854
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,710
Oh! I love it!
Honest, I love it!

855
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,302
Just put it back on and get out!

856
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:21,413
- No!
- Hurry! Hurry!

857
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:23,248
No, no. I want to please you.

858
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:25,417
You can please me, just get out!

859
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:26,952
Here. Here, do you like this one?

860
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:28,454
Oh, I love it! It's beautiful!

861
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:29,568
It's gorgeous! Come on.

862
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:34,827
Now, get in there and get dressed
and don't come out until I call you.

863
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,196
Eddie, are you sure
you're gonna like this one?

864
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:40,256
Oh, I'm crazy about it!
I'm nuts about it!

865
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,435
You look awfully nice, Gloria.

866
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,137
Thanks, Joe.

867
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:47,172
You look... neat.

868
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:50,164
Yep. Real neat.

869
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:55,547
Look, Joe, do you want to...

870
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,731
Or do you want to talk to me?
Make up your mind.

871
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,687
Is that Eddie?

872
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:04,246
Eddie? Oh!
Yeah, that's Eddie.

873
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:06,959
- Eddie Hatch, you mean?
- In there with that girl?

874
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:08,660
Girl?

875
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:10,095
There's no girl in there.

876
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,464
Eddie's in there alone.
Eddie's working.

877
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:14,233
Yep.

878
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:16,435
Just working away.

879
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,790
I'll bet!

880
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,224
Where did she go?

881
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:40,559
Oh, hello, Gloria.

882
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:41,894
Where do who go?

883
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:44,263
Never mind her.
Where did you go?

884
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:45,998
Oh, you look wonderful today, honey.

885
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:47,166
I like your hair that way.

886
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,634
It's too late for compliments.

887
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,002
You're going to wear your hair shorter

888
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:51,937
if you don't explain
what happened to you last night.

889
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:54,273
Last night?
Oh! Last night.

890
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:57,543
Oh, you mean when I left the house

891
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:59,444
while you were out getting the soup?

892
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:01,046
What kind of soup did you get, honey?

893
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:02,981
Noodle and spinach.

894
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,184
I didn't want your guest
to be disappointed.

895
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:06,185
Oh, now, Gloria--

896
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,386
If I ever run into her,

897
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:10,589
she'll wish she had eaten plenty of spinach!

898
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:13,525
Eddie Hatch, if you think for one minute
you're gonna make a fool of me--

899
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,994
Gloria, Gloria, now--
now don't get upset.

900
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,230
- It's not good for you.
- Good for me?

901
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:20,065
I suppose you think
it's good to be stood up

902
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,334
by a two-timing,
double-crossing chiseler!

903
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,602
Why, for two cents, I'd hit you--

904
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:24,770
Oh, no, no!

905
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:26,572
- Gloria, that's breakable!
- Oh, so is your head!

906
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:28,507
Gloria! Gloria, please!

907
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,075
Everything in here is charged to me!

908
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,395
Let go! Let go!

909
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:36,114
I never want to see you again,
Eddie Hatch!

910
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:38,383
Why, you-- you can go
wherever you please!

911
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:40,052
Oh, Gloria!
Now wait a minute!

912
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:41,954
I didn't mean anything by--

913
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,457
Do whatever you want!
Oh, I hate you!

914
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,860
Hey, Eddie!

915
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,595
Eddie, give me the vase.

916
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,914
I think she's mad.

917
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:15,420
Hey, you're just the guy I'm looking for.

918
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:16,855
Good morning, Mr. Kerrigan.

919
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,949
- The strangest thing just--
- Yeah, I've got a warrant for your arrest.

920
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:31,470
Mr. Big!

921
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:33,495
I'm through with him!

922
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:37,576
Cheer up, Gloria.

923
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,045
You and Eddie will be making up again.

924
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:41,613
What do you wanna bet?

925
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:44,049
No more dates with him!

926
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:46,404
There are plenty of other fish in the sea!

927
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:54,393
Gloria!

928
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:56,816
Gloria, your shoe.

929
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:03,184
You know, Gloria,

930
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,939
if you ever need anything,

931
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,708
you can always count on me.

932
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:11,376
Thanks, Joe.

933
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:13,312
Well, I'll be seeing you.

934
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:15,580
When?

935
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:17,138
We'll see.

936
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:21,911
See ya.

937
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:25,873
See ya.

938
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:32,164
Say, maybe he's in the basement.

939
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:34,348
We'll give this floor the once-over.
Come on.

940
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,865
Well, he ain't in here. Come on.

941
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:42,753
Peek-a-boo, Hatch.

942
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:57,339
Cover the employees' entrance.

943
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,423
Pardon me.

944
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:06,291
We haven't met.

945
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:07,526
That is, you haven't met me,

946
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:10,195
but my name is Whitfield Savory II.

947
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,254
The same name as this establishment.

948
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:14,166
I am this establishment.

949
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:15,834
Did you sleep well?

950
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:17,469
Yes, beautifully, thank you.

951
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:19,838
Yes, beautifully.

952
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:21,206
And-- And the clothes?

953
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:22,474
Oh, divine.

954
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,810
A mere trifle.
Take the whole store.

955
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:27,045
You can even set fire to it
if it amuses you.

956
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,047
You are generous, Mr. Savory.

957
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:30,382
Call me Whitfield.

958
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:32,851
My car is waiting.
Shall we go?

959
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:34,186
We?

960
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:36,121
I've arranged everything.

961
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:38,214
Lunch at the Mum and Quiet Club.

962
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,692
Then to Montauk Point
for a candlelight dinner

963
00:53:40,817 --> 00:53:41,993
at the Sand and Surf Yacht Club.

964
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:44,696
Then a moonlit ride to the Adirondacks

965
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:46,865
and breakfast at the Crop and Spur Club.

966
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,301
I'm sorry, but I don't think
Eddie would approve.

967
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:51,136
Eddie? What Eddie?

968
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:52,838
Eddie Hatch, of course.

969
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:54,539
Hatch?

970
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:56,541
Yes, last night, he brought me here,

971
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:59,544
and then this morning, he surprised me
with all these beautiful clothes.

972
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:01,880
Hatch. That clerk.

973
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:03,939
That $40-a-week window dresser?

974
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,418
Eddie!

975
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,386
Eddie, where have you been?

976
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:10,655
He's been trying to duck me.
I got some questions to ask you.

977
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,157
Look, Mr. Savory, please don't blame her.

978
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:14,659
- It's all my fault.
- Have you got the warrant?

979
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:16,809
Add these charges:
breaking into Savory's,

980
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:20,946
turning this floor into a YWCA,
and stealing clothes.

981
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,935
Well, look, if you'll just let her go,
I'll pay for everything.

982
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,637
Out of your $40 a week?

983
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,539
- 43.75.
- 43.75.

984
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:29,241
- Come on!
- Oh, one moment.

985
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:32,893
Whitfield, does this document
give you the right to put Eddie in jail?

986
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:34,503
It does indeed, my dear.

987
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:35,914
May I see it, please?

988
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,150
Don't worry about me.

989
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,709
Oh, it's very interesting.

990
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:44,956
What the...

991
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:47,242
I thought you were a big boy now.

992
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:50,341
Darling, come on.

993
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:54,146
Wait, wait.
I'll turn him into an owl.

994
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,034
But I didn't do this.
I don't even understand it.

995
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:57,888
I don't know who--

996
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:00,672
What are you doing?

997
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,474
Arrest that man!
Come on, get going!

998
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:04,567
Oh, no, no.
Don't, don't, don't.

999
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:06,692
Stop it, please. Stop it.

1000
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:08,394
Don't stand there like a dummy.

1001
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:14,543
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't know.

1002
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:16,111
I just had a funny feeling, boss,

1003
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:18,657
like I was gonna lay an egg.

1004
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:20,992
We gotta get out of here fast.

1005
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:22,277
Come on.

1006
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:25,220
Wait a minute.

1007
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:26,665
What am I running away for?

1008
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,280
I haven't done anything.
I'm not a criminal.

1009
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:30,068
Of course you're not.

1010
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:33,471
But that-- that detective
thinks I stole the statue

1011
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:36,588
and Mr. Savory accuses me
of stealing your clothes.

1012
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:39,911
Gloria's mad at me
and Joe thinks I'm out of my head.

1013
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:42,781
I'm gonna go to jail and lose my job
all just because--

1014
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:45,500
- You kissed a statue.
- Yeah.

1015
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:47,953
It was that champagne.
That's what made me do it.

1016
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:50,512
Well, I'm gonna go back to them now
and tell them the whole truth.

1017
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:52,891
You did, and they didn't believe you.

1018
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,745
Oh, yeah.

1019
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:57,662
Well, you could be my witness.

1020
00:55:57,787 --> 00:56:00,498
That's it! You could be my witness
and explain it all to them,

1021
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:02,400
the paper dolls and everything.

1022
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:05,494
Then Mr. Savory will believe me,
and he won't think I'm a criminal.

1023
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:10,223
Perhaps I could persuade Mr. Savory.

1024
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:14,360
Oh, no. One of the girls in the store
told me all about him.

1025
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,096
Did he ask you for a date?

1026
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:25,438
Now look, Your Majesty,
you are the goddess of love.

1027
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:29,427
You belong up on a pedestal where people
can see you and admire you--

1028
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,930
lots of people, thousands of people.

1029
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,545
You really want me to go back.

1030
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,500
Will you?

1031
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:37,035
I didn't think it was time.

1032
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,685
There couldn't be a better time.

1033
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:45,310
Gee, it sure is swell of you, Miss Venus.

1034
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:46,993
I really appreciate it, too.

1035
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,367
Now my life will be
just like it was before--

1036
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:52,031
sensible, orderly, and practical.

1037
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:54,019
And I'll make up with Gloria.

1038
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:56,772
Yep, just like it was before.

1039
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:20,892
Well...

1040
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,249
Will you be happy...

1041
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:25,650
that is, where you're going?

1042
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,766
We worry a lot about you mortals.

1043
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:32,310
Well, what's it like, hmm?

1044
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,917
Have you got big cities like this?

1045
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:37,611
Places to go?
Movies and parks and things?

1046
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:42,383
Gee. It's a shame you didn't
get to see everything.

1047
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:44,993
I could at least have taken you to the park.

1048
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,439
I've caused you enough trouble already.

1049
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,657
Trouble? What do you mean trouble?

1050
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:52,711
Why, I guess we could go
to the park if we wanted to.

1051
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,245
You don't really want to take me.

1052
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:57,601
Of course I do.
I know my own mind.

1053
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:01,567
Right now I want to take you to the park.

1054
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:06,273
But I ask you, Molly,
even giving myself the worst of it,

1055
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:09,476
what does this confounded
window trimmer got that I haven't got?

1056
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:12,247
Well, to mention just one thing,
the girl you want.

1057
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:13,765
What can he do for her?

1058
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:16,484
I can offer her anything she wants,
anything that money can buy.

1059
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:17,854
You did but it wasn't enough.

1060
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,723
It just doesn't make sense.

1061
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:22,957
Try to reason about love,
and you will lose your reason.

1062
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:24,361
Old French proverb.

1063
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,934
Well, I'm not through yet.

1064
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:27,764
This is a challenge, Molly.

1065
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:30,634
When I want something,
I get it, no matter what it costs.

1066
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:33,264
Not this time, I've got a feeling.

1067
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:36,037
You know, for everybody,
there's bound to be one thing,

1068
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,647
one person that's unattainable.

1069
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:40,043
Well, not for me.

1070
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,378
Okay, lord and master.

1071
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:13,381
I love your park, Eddie.

1072
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:16,417
It seems more beautiful
tonight than it ever has.

1073
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:33,834
If this, this is love

1074
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:37,949
Why didn't somebody tell me?

1075
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:42,636
Don't look now,
but my heart is showing

1076
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:45,957
No matter what I say or do

1077
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:49,313
Can't hide it, my heart's Romeoing

1078
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:53,388
I can't stay away from you

1079
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:56,868
You smile and my dreams start helloing

1080
00:59:56,993 --> 01:00:00,572
They spin when you come into view

1081
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:04,075
In circles I may not be going

1082
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,966
But I feel I reel with you

1083
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:11,883
When mister kisses miss

1084
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:15,253
No need for words to embroider

1085
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:19,157
When mister kisses miss

1086
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:22,427
Changing her name is in order

1087
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:26,197
You smile and the stardust is blowing

1088
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:29,868
We're whirling in a world that's new

1089
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:33,438
Don't look now,
but your heart is showing

1090
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:35,473
And it flips and halts

1091
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:37,275
And turns summersaults

1092
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,927
Darling, it wants to waltz with you

1093
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:52,857
Don't ask me, but here is my answer

1094
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:56,494
I think that you are magically he

1095
01:00:56,619 --> 01:00:59,864
Who could be a love necromancer

1096
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:03,823
Necromancing is for me

1097
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,171
Don't stop me, but I am replying

1098
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:10,875
I know that you are magically she

1099
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,178
The creature would like to be tying

1100
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:16,180
- As you coo
- I do

1101
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:17,415
With me

1102
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:21,452
Around 'round and 'round

1103
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:25,156
I'm just like a record that's playing

1104
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:28,793
Repeating the same sounds

1105
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:32,063
The needle must like what I'm saying

1106
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:35,934
These wings that I feel I am growing

1107
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:39,237
Belong to someone I never knew

1108
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:42,607
Don't look now, but heaven is showing

1109
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:48,246
And tonight, the sky is my sky to fly

1110
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,181
Darling

1111
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:52,317
Falling in love

1112
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:56,287
Falling in love

1113
01:01:56,412 --> 01:02:00,872
With you

1114
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:51,009
I feel as if I'd swallowed
a symphony orchestra

1115
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:54,646
playing the most beautiful music
in the world.

1116
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,035
In two worlds, darling.

1117
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,522
Troubled, angel?

1118
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:07,392
Nothing.

1119
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:09,127
Tell me.

1120
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:11,462
Well, what about this fellow,

1121
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:15,166
the-- the one you turned into an owl?

1122
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,668
Hipp-Hipp-Hipp--

1123
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:17,817
Hippolytus?

1124
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:20,304
Didn't you love him once?

1125
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:23,489
Never. He bothered me.

1126
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:27,512
Do I bother you?

1127
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,881
No, dear.

1128
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:31,906
Not like that.

1129
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,234
Feathers.

1130
01:03:38,047 --> 01:03:40,525
What about--
What about this other one?

1131
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,161
- This Polyph--
- Polyphones?

1132
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:46,564
- Very annoying.
- What?

1133
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:49,283
So annoying that I finally
had to turn him into a--

1134
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,204
...a rock.

1135
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,973
- You mean a boulder?
- A large one.

1136
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:58,609
It's perched on the side
of Mount Olympus.

1137
01:03:58,734 --> 01:04:01,379
But none of them really had my love
the way you do, darling.

1138
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,281
Oh, I'm glad if I'm different.

1139
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:05,917
You are. You're the only one.

1140
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:09,754
Well, then I don't care what happens.

1141
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:13,391
You can turn me into a fire hydrant
or a mountain goat if you want to.

1142
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:14,483
It's worth it.

1143
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:20,783
This is the place, boss.

1144
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:50,128
You sure he's here?

1145
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:53,097
Sure. We tailed him and the dame,
and then phoned you.

1146
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:55,466
Savory doubled the ante
if we nab Hatch tonight.

1147
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:57,468
Come on.

1148
01:04:57,593 --> 01:05:01,873
Gee, I just can't believe
that this is happening to me.

1149
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:04,342
You know? I...

1150
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:06,377
I-- I don't know what to do.

1151
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:09,814
I don't know what to say

1152
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:13,184
and I don't know what to do.

1153
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:14,685
I'd like to do things for you.

1154
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:16,521
I'd like to take you places.

1155
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:19,657
You know, like the men in the ads,
men of distinction,

1156
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:20,992
you know, like Mr. Savory.

1157
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:23,027
He could buy you everything.

1158
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:24,829
Everything?

1159
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:26,998
Let me see.

1160
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:29,033
Could he buy me a bag of popcorn?

1161
01:05:29,158 --> 01:05:31,936
Oh, don't be silly.
Of course not.

1162
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:34,427
What would you want with a bag--

1163
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:38,943
Popcorn?

1164
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:40,144
Do you mean it?

1165
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,669
A great big bag.

1166
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:46,532
I'll be right back.

1167
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,460
You'll still be here
when I get back, won't you?

1168
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:57,762
You won't go away?

1169
01:05:57,887 --> 01:05:59,855
I'll be here, Eddie.

1170
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,686
I want the best bag of popcorn you got.

1171
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,988
- It's all the same, bub.
- Well, it's gotta be extra special.

1172
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:26,924
Yeah, this is for a walking, talking statue.

1173
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:30,177
Come to me.
Come close to me.

1174
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:34,265
Grab him!

1175
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:37,268
I can't come with you now!
I'll come with you later!

1176
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:39,270
You're coming now!
Take him, boys!

1177
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:40,638
I can't!

1178
01:06:40,763 --> 01:06:41,839
I can't leave her here alone!

1179
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:42,940
She's a goddess!

1180
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:45,343
- He's still crazy! Go on!
- Let go of me!

1181
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:47,111
She doesn't know about mortals!

1182
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:50,248
- Take him out.
- Venus! Venus!

1183
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:52,950
Venus!

1184
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:54,474
Venus!

1185
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,763
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1186
01:07:05,888 --> 01:07:07,164
Some detectives just grabbed a kid.

1187
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:08,633
Yeah, took him away in the car.

1188
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:09,800
What did he do?

1189
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:12,223
Search me.
He was up there buying popcorn.

1190
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:19,777
Debussy.

1191
01:07:19,902 --> 01:07:22,113
You know, Debussy does
something to women.

1192
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:25,867
Personally, I go for Buzzy Bellew
and his Musical Crew.

1193
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:28,653
Save your needles, chum.

1194
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:32,189
I suspect that this little gal
is going to be your Waterloo.

1195
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:33,724
What else can she do?

1196
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:37,428
When they toss Hatch into the Bastille,
she must turn to me.

1197
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,196
I'm the only one who can get him out.

1198
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:41,365
Fine strategy, general,
but it won't work,

1199
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:43,219
not with this baby.

1200
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,571
Hello, baby!

1201
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:51,509
My dear, what a very
unexpected pleasure.

1202
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:54,979
Am I too late for
that candlelight supper?

1203
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:56,247
Gracious, no!

1204
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:58,616
I'll put a couple of candles
on to broil right away.

1205
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,017
I'll manage, Molly.

1206
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:02,987
I'm a whiz at tallows sauted a la Savory.

1207
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:04,340
Good night, Molly.

1208
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:07,458
I'll chill a bottle of wine for you.

1209
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,744
- Any preference?
- Your pleasure.

1210
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:20,504
Don't worry.

1211
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:23,507
Not me. You can
take care of yourself.

1212
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:25,676
I mean about him.

1213
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:28,279
You really care for him, don't you?

1214
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:30,481
He reminds me of a dog I had.

1215
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:31,816
No.

1216
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,451
No, you really love him.

1217
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:34,585
Well, why not?

1218
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:37,088
Working here, I get a 20% discount.

1219
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:38,356
That's what's wrong with you, Molly.

1220
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:40,358
You keep everything inside.
You shouldn't.

1221
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:41,926
You must let him know.

1222
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:43,794
You talk like an expert.

1223
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:45,443
What do you think?

1224
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:51,402
Good night, Molly.

1225
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:52,903
So long.

1226
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:55,622
Watch out for Debussy.

1227
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,086
This is lovely.

1228
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:10,337
Yes.

1229
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:20,965
To you.

1230
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:22,648
To us.

1231
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:37,148
She walks in beauty like the night.

1232
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:40,818
Of cloudless climes and starry skies.

1233
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:43,287
Poetic approach, huh?

1234
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:45,056
Do you bother to learn the whole poem

1235
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,258
or just those parts
you can whisper to women?

1236
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:50,011
Or they can whisper to me.

1237
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:54,432
Another good one is,

1238
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:57,034
For thou art fairer than the evening air

1239
01:09:57,159 --> 01:10:00,322
clad in the beauty of a thousand stars.

1240
01:10:04,266 --> 01:10:06,131
I'll make a note of that.

1241
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:10,605
- Some more wine?
- Please.

1242
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:54,658
You know, you are rather nice.

1243
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:57,274
I'm sorry about the way I've acted.

1244
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:03,234
Beauty likened to a song.

1245
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:05,803
Such beauty can do no wrong.

1246
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:08,624
- Please.
- You're maddening.

1247
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:11,675
You know, Whitfield, I keep thinking...

1248
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:12,877
- Me, too.
...of Eddie.

1249
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:14,812
- He's been arrested.
- Wonderful.

1250
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:16,580
But it was all my fault.

1251
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:18,415
- Forget him.
- Poor boy.

1252
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,917
In jail in a cold cell.

1253
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:21,652
I'll send him an overcoat
and some blankets.

1254
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:24,955
Maybe-- Maybe you could get him out?

1255
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,224
Why, yes, yes.
Of course Anything. Anything.

1256
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:29,510
It's the least I can do for you.

1257
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,443
Yes?

1258
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:48,646
The city jail?

1259
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:50,948
Oh, it's you.
Well, what now?

1260
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:53,751
Hello, Kerrigan?
I want a word with you.

1261
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:55,553
Now I'm Kerrigan, huh?

1262
01:11:55,678 --> 01:11:58,689
Well, begorra, I've got the feet for it.

1263
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:00,858
Kerrigan, you are a card.

1264
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:03,093
- Tell him about Eddie.
- Yes, my dear.

1265
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:04,995
I want you to do
something for me, old boy.

1266
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,298
Why don't you spin your platters?

1267
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:10,234
You know, Debussy does
something to women.

1268
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:12,403
Or better yet,
flip out your bank books.

1269
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:14,572
You can give her anything money can buy.

1270
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:15,839
Now listen here, Kerrigan.

1271
01:12:15,964 --> 01:12:17,741
I want action on this,
do you understand?

1272
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:19,777
- Whitfield, you're so wonderful.
- Thank you, my dear.

1273
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:20,945
Hold on there, Kerrigan.

1274
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:22,213
What's that?

1275
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:23,647
Hatch! Eddie Hatch!
Tell him about Hatch!

1276
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:25,749
Yes, my dear.
I'll have him out in a minute.

1277
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:27,885
Now look here, Molly--
Molligan--

1278
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,521
Kerrigan.

1279
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:33,958
I'll put an ad in the morning paper
for a secretary.

1280
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:35,759
Help wanted, female.

1281
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:39,263
Must be able to take
shorthand and body blows.

1282
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:41,699
No, no. Don't do anything rash.
We'll talk it over.

1283
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:42,967
Here, let me talk to him.

1284
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:44,301
I'll take care of this, my dear.

1285
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:46,270
You've pulled a lot of chintzy deals,

1286
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:49,740
but framing a kid to get his girl
is too rich for me.

1287
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,609
Even I'm finally ashamed of you.

1288
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:53,944
No, no, don't go.
I've got to talk to you.

1289
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:56,146
You know how I need you.
I depend on you.

1290
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:58,882
You didn't seem to need me before.

1291
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:01,485
Well, you did everything
but bounce me out of your apartment.

1292
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:02,586
I'll do anything.

1293
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:05,522
- Tell him you'll give him a bonus.
- I'll give you a bonus.

1294
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:08,025
Please, my dear, please.
I'll take care of this.

1295
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,727
- I'll come right over.
- I'll go with you.

1296
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:12,196
No, no, no, no!
You wait here. I'll be back.

1297
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:13,564
You wait there. I'll be over.

1298
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:15,232
Save yourself the trip.

1299
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:17,268
And tell baby thanks for the advice.

1300
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,136
I haven't felt so good in years.

1301
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:20,671
So long, Whitfield.

1302
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:22,973
I walk out in beauty like the night.

1303
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:25,075
No, no, no--

1304
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,810
Some wine, please, my dear.

1305
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:29,446
You-- You've got to listen.

1306
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:30,503
Don't-- Don't hang up.

1307
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:32,072
You-- You can't leave me flat--

1308
01:13:39,648 --> 01:13:40,791
My dear, are you all right?

1309
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:41,848
I'm fine.

1310
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:43,417
Molly! Molly!

1311
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:51,835
She's hung up.

1312
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,337
She wouldn't listen.
She's leaving me.

1313
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:54,738
Well, what are you doing here?

1314
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:56,407
You're right.
I can be there in a minute.

1315
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:58,909
Two minutes.
First you call Kerrigan.

1316
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:00,711
Kerrigan?
Oh, why, of course.

1317
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:02,770
Yes, my dear, of course.

1318
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:08,886
Hello, Molly? Molly--

1319
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:10,421
Molly?

1320
01:14:10,546 --> 01:14:11,822
Who is this?

1321
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:13,574
Who you kiddin'?

1322
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:16,393
Well, yes. Yes, Mr. Savory.

1323
01:14:16,518 --> 01:14:18,796
I'm dropping all charges.
Release Hatch at once.

1324
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:20,030
Tell Eddie I'll be waiting.

1325
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:22,589
Send Hatch up to my place right away.

1326
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:23,867
The place is yours.

1327
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:25,703
Use anything you want.
Stay as long as you like.

1328
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,125
Thank you, Whitfield.

1329
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:30,227
This orchid, I think it would
look nice on Molly.

1330
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:34,099
Thank you.

1331
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:38,197
Excuse me.

1332
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:43,107
Tell Hatch he can have tomorrow off.

1333
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:03,264
No, no! Not now!

1334
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:17,041
Please! Please!
Just a few moments more!

1335
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:57,809
Wait here.

1336
01:15:57,953 --> 01:15:58,942
- Hey, Eddie!
- Joe!

1337
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:01,498
Hey, I got your bail.
Don't worry. I'll get you out.

1338
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:03,750
- You are out!
- Savory dropped the charges.

1339
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:05,450
Well, gee, that's great!
Then they found the statue.

1340
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:07,528
- Who stole it?
- It wasn't stolen.

1341
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:09,573
Venus is waiting for me right now.

1342
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:11,074
Savory's Department Store.

1343
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:12,223
Venus? Oh, no, Eddie!

1344
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:13,925
Not that again!

1345
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:19,140
Did you say Savory's Department Store?

1346
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:20,150
Yeah, Savory's Department Store.

1347
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:21,685
- To the nearest hospital.
- Savory's.

1348
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:23,620
- To the hospital!
- Make up your mind.

1349
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:25,269
He wants to go the hospital!

1350
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:26,757
Savory's. I'm paying for this trip.

1351
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:28,125
Now look, Eddie, listen to me.

1352
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,127
- You're sick. You don't feel well.
- I'll show you.

1353
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:31,742
I'll introduce you to her, Joe.

1354
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:33,354
You'll like her.
She's wonderful.

1355
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:35,979
- Oh, Eddie.
- Faster!

1356
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:37,557
I've got to get there, Joe.

1357
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:38,936
She may leave.

1358
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:41,305
I want her to stay.
I want to marry her.

1359
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,523
We'll get a little place
out in Ozone Heights.

1360
01:16:43,665 --> 01:16:45,075
Oh, yeah.

1361
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,226
I can just see you bouncing
little statues on your knee.

1362
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:50,497
Eddie, you've just got
to stop talking like that.

1363
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:52,300
She's not a statue, Joe.

1364
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:54,251
She's Venus, goddess of love.

1365
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:57,254
You win. To the hospital.

1366
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:59,156
Savory's Department Store!

1367
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:00,557
Look, Eddie, just-- just relax.

1368
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:01,740
Speak low

1369
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:03,942
- You got to quit thinking about--
- Quiet. Listen.

1370
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:05,747
When you speak love

1371
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:10,324
Our summer day withers away

1372
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:14,452
Too soon, too soon

1373
01:17:14,596 --> 01:17:17,030
Speak low

1374
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:19,190
When you speak love

1375
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:21,427
- But--
- Listen!

1376
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:22,913
I can hear her.

1377
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:26,350
Like ships adrift, we're swept apart

1378
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,909
Don't be silly.
That's just the radio.

1379
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:31,205
That's Venus! Faster!

1380
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:32,623
Turn off your radio, will ya?

1381
01:17:32,748 --> 01:17:34,375
- It ain't on.
- It must be on!

1382
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:36,609
Clam up, bub. Let's listen.

1383
01:17:36,752 --> 01:17:38,662
We're all crazy!

1384
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:40,097
Lost in the dark

1385
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:44,283
Too soon, too soon

1386
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:46,951
I fear

1387
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:50,587
Wherever I go

1388
01:17:50,732 --> 01:17:53,200
That tomorrow is near

1389
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:54,927
Tomorrow is here

1390
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:59,383
And always too soon

1391
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:02,739
Time is old

1392
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:06,405
And love so brief

1393
01:18:06,548 --> 01:18:09,893
Love is pure gold

1394
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:14,421
And time a thief

1395
01:18:14,556 --> 01:18:17,787
We're late

1396
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:21,418
Darling, we're late

1397
01:18:21,563 --> 01:18:25,556
The curtain descends, everything ends

1398
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:29,797
Too soon, too soon

1399
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:33,339
I wait

1400
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:38,208
Darling

1401
01:18:38,346 --> 01:18:45,514
Will you speak love

1402
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:51,926
Venus? Venus?

1403
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,937
See, Eddie? I told you.
There's nobody here.

1404
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:56,622
She's got to be here!
She must be here!

1405
01:18:56,765 --> 01:18:58,392
Venus? Venus?

1406
01:18:58,533 --> 01:18:59,727
Hey, Eddie, come on.

1407
01:18:59,868 --> 01:19:01,597
If Mr. Savory catches us here,
we'll both be fired.

1408
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:03,261
She's in the model home.
That's where she is.

1409
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:04,497
Oh, Eddie.

1410
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:15,577
Good shot, Ed.

1411
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:17,651
- Come on, Mr. Savory.
- Where did you have it hidden?

1412
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:18,844
Yes, give us the real dope.

1413
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:23,185
Well, the statue simply reappeared
as mysteriously as it disappeared.

1414
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:25,850
Before you write this off
as another publicity gimmick,

1415
01:19:25,994 --> 01:19:28,462
I suggest you look
at Ludavicci Fassoli's volume

1416
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:31,862
on the strange legends and myths
surrounding the Anatolian Venus.

1417
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,333
In our book department,
Morocco bound.

1418
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:36,869
It's probably just coincidence,

1419
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:39,064
but while our goddess
of love was missing,

1420
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:40,584
the City Hall was snowed under.

1421
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:42,233
They ran out of marriage licenses.

1422
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:45,505
Love sure reared its beautiful head.

1423
01:19:45,647 --> 01:19:46,705
Thanks, girl.

1424
01:19:46,848 --> 01:19:48,816
Did you tell Hatch about his $3.00 raise?

1425
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:51,384
- 3.75.
- Oh, yes.

1426
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,216
Well, if you'll excuse us,
I believe there's a place called--

1427
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:57,052
Niagara Falls.
We're going over in a barrel.

1428
01:19:57,192 --> 01:19:59,490
See you when we get back.

1429
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:26,252
You never even said good-bye.

1430
01:20:29,457 --> 01:20:31,687
Oh, pardon me.

1431
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,692
Could you direct me to the model home?

1432
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:35,160
Oh, yes. It's right through there.

1433
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:38,130
- Second floor.
- Thank you very much.

1434
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:42,059
Miss!

1435
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:52,089
Did you say you were looking
for the model home?

1436
01:20:52,214 --> 01:20:53,356
Yes.

1437
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:55,459
You see, I just started
to work here today.

1438
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:57,928
Oh, well, that's fine.

1439
01:20:58,053 --> 01:20:59,663
My name is Hatch, Eddie Hatch.

1440
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:02,332
Mine's Jones, Venus Jones.

1441
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:03,633
That's beautiful.

1442
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:05,469
Well, it's unusual anyway.

1443
01:21:05,594 --> 01:21:08,872
Nobody's ever likely to meet
two girls named Venus.

1444
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:11,397
No, I-- I guess not.
