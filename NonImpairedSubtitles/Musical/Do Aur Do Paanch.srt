1
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:40,257
One of them has arrived.
Where's the other?

2
00:04:41,128 --> 00:04:42,595
There he is

3
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:45,160
Just you get out of here, you dog!
After l'm through with you...

4
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:47,127
the police won't even know
whose corpse it is.

5
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:52,532
l'll make you pray for your death!
And death will be slow in coming.

6
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:57,538
l've seen a thousand men like you.
- You better run, man.

7
00:04:57,811 --> 00:04:59,972
Shut up!
- He shuts up first.

8
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:06,479
You shut your mouth first, you cur!
- Shut up! Else you'll do solitary.

9
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,129
Why do they fight like dogs?
- Hush! lf they hear you...

10
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:23,892
they'll break your neck
once they're out of here.

11
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:30,234
But why do they fight like this?
- Destiny, l think.

12
00:05:30,544 --> 00:05:34,947
Maybe they are long-lost brothers
from some lifetime in the past.

13
00:05:35,315 --> 00:05:38,773
Maybe that's why destiny wants them
to come together in this act.

14
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:42,249
Whenever one of them goes thieving,
the other turns up.

15
00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:06,401
No one here.
- Let's go back.

16
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:33,028
Money! Where's it coming from?
- Look! The two of them! Get them.

17
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:40,463
What's it?
- The two of them are back.

18
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:44,935
They would, in any case.
They're destined...

19
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:47,611
to live all their lives in jails

20
00:07:47,981 --> 00:07:53,920
But they aren't abusing each other.
- Must've run out of stock

21
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:56,585
Not abusive...?

22
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:06,961
They really aren't doing it!
Doesn't look like...

23
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:15,697
they'll come together in this lifetime.
They'll end up killing each other.

24
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:24,177
But if they teamed up, they might
pull off the job, l couldn't.

25
00:08:25,785 --> 00:08:28,777
What job?
- A kidnapping

26
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:38,120
The millionaire's son. Bittu.
He'd fetch 10, maybe 20 million.

27
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:43,233
Why isn't anyone else trying?
- Tough. l tried. Once.

28
00:08:43,637 --> 00:08:49,269
l couldn't get my hands on the kid.
But l killed a guard on the run.

29
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:54,309
So here l am, serving life.
- Could l give it a try?

30
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:57,112
First give this a try

31
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:03,416
Yes?
- Can l ask a question?

32
00:09:04,124 --> 00:09:07,184
What does this Mr. Seth do with
all that money?

33
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,191
He hires security for
his son's protection.

34
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:16,198
l don't want to play.

35
00:09:16,536 --> 00:09:19,027
l won't.

36
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:27,170
Not until Daddy comes.

37
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:34,283
l'm not playing.
l'm angry with Daddy.

38
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:57,873
l'm not talking to you!
You've bored me.

39
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:02,005
Come on, let's talk.
- No! l won't talk.

40
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:04,950
You won't talk to your Daddy?

41
00:10:06,553 --> 00:10:07,918
What happened, son?

42
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,092
What's wrong, Martha?

43
00:10:14,561 --> 00:10:17,724
You promised him you'd go to
his school on parents' day.

44
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:20,156
Bittu missed you.

45
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:22,228
Everyone else's parents had come.

46
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:31,203
Oh, l forgot! Look son,
l'm very sorry. l was too busy.

47
00:10:31,578 --> 00:10:35,070
And one day, you'll forget
your Bittu too.

48
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:40,715
Don't say that.
You're the only one l have, son.

49
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:44,218
And you're the only one
l have too, dad.

50
00:10:44,657 --> 00:10:49,060
Don't leave me.
lt scares me.

51
00:10:55,535 --> 00:11:00,666
l'll stay with you all this month.
l'll do no work, okay?

52
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:08,543
l want to be with my son...
- But sir...

53
00:11:13,053 --> 00:11:18,389
Will you really stay with me, dad?
- That's right, son.

54
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:20,852
l'll play with you too.

55
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:23,058
Let's go visiting a
hill-station tomorrow.

56
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:24,421
The day after, dad.

57
00:11:24,864 --> 00:11:27,856
l have a cricket match tomorrow.
You'll come to watch it, won't you?

58
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:30,859
You play a cricket match
and l don't even know about it!

59
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:34,498
Of course l'll watch you play!

60
00:11:34,908 --> 00:11:39,641
But you must score a century.
- l haven't had any practice, dad.

61
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:44,445
We'll deal with that right now.
Go and get your kit.

62
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:54,258
A trunk call for you, sir

63
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:01,191
Yes? lsn't he coming?

64
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:09,601
The experts from London
aren't arriving.

65
00:12:10,577 --> 00:12:13,808
Work on your plant will be delayed.
- Why aren't they coming?

66
00:12:25,592 --> 00:12:27,856
Book a ticket for me on
a flight to London tomorrow.

67
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:31,757
No, l'm not going.
- But sir...

68
00:12:32,232 --> 00:12:34,564
Call Barrister William
in Washington.

69
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:37,234
Ask him to leave for London
and deal with it.

70
00:12:37,737 --> 00:12:38,635
Go on.

71
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:41,170
Fetch the bat, son.

72
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:43,705
Let's begin the
practice session.

73
00:12:55,822 --> 00:12:57,790
Here we go...
get ready, everyone.

74
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:04,292
Daddy!
- Let me take off my coat.

75
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:09,394
l can't leave. At no cost!
Tell him that.

76
00:13:10,003 --> 00:13:11,868
Let's get started.

77
00:13:15,175 --> 00:13:16,870
Now look, Harish...
- Daddy!

78
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,649
lt's Barrister William, sir!

79
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:43,333
Must l come?

80
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:57,906
All right. l'll board the
next flight for London.

81
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:20,700
Are you leaving tomorrow, dad?
- Yes. l'll have to.

82
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:26,271
l know you find it lonely
without me.

83
00:14:26,746 --> 00:14:29,408
But l can't help it.

84
00:14:30,783 --> 00:14:37,552
Once our plant is ready,
we'll be famous in the country.

85
00:14:38,258 --> 00:14:43,355
You will get a lot of respect.
You will play with money.

86
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:47,456
Money means a lot of power, son.

87
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:51,094
When you don't have money,...

88
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:55,502
even those who are close to you,
shy away from you.

89
00:14:56,476 --> 00:15:01,641
And people love even strangers
who have the money.

90
00:15:06,853 --> 00:15:14,760
l don't want these guards, dad.
They don't allow me to play.

91
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:19,095
They don't let me go out...
l'm scared of them.

92
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:25,170
No, son. lt's necessary for them
to stay with you.

93
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:31,904
They protect you from the devils
who want to kidnap you.

94
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:33,408
Who are they, dad?

95
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:44,984
All my boys are here, l see.
- Yes

96
00:15:45,425 --> 00:15:47,985
l've summoned them from their dens.

97
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:52,690
Ask them to spread out
in the city.

98
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,799
l can't say where he will
take the child.

99
00:15:56,936 --> 00:16:00,531
Just follow the instructions
l give.

100
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:04,768
Bring the kid to me when
you find the opportunity.

101
00:16:05,345 --> 00:16:07,006
Okay? Go on.

102
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,481
Listen, boys...

103
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:13,912
l don't take no for an answer.

104
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:16,881
ls that clear?
- Yes.

105
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,889
What's the point in shutting
down all the dens...

106
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:24,423
and going hammer and tongs
for Mathur?

107
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:31,801
He once went hammer and tongs
for me, my boy.

108
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:35,568
l used to be a clerk in the company
where he was the manager.

109
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:39,770
l stole a hundred thousand
from the boss's safe.

110
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:42,440
l wanted to start
a gambling den.

111
00:16:43,116 --> 00:16:45,175
The manager caught me.

112
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:46,918
l told him that l wasn't
stealing the money.

113
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,154
l was using the money because our
employer was away for 3 months.

114
00:16:51,591 --> 00:16:53,582
l promised to put it back
before the boss returned.

115
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,329
But he played the honest man.
He handed me to the police.

116
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:03,363
He had shattered all my dreams.

117
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:07,831
And now, he has pinned
all his hopes on his son.

118
00:17:08,574 --> 00:17:10,542
l will shatter his
dreams too.

119
00:18:01,961 --> 00:18:03,929
Hurry up! Get the kid!

120
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,391
Leave me alone! Let me go!

121
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:08,661
Hurry! Quick!

122
00:20:22,401 --> 00:20:23,732
Go in and take him with you.

123
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:41,184
Thanks for saving the kid.

124
00:20:41,621 --> 00:20:44,488
Have you recognized them, Miss Shalu?
- Yes, l have.

125
00:20:52,298 --> 00:20:57,133
Where will you escape from me?

126
00:20:58,537 --> 00:21:02,997
ls this why l brought you up?
From those filthy gutters?

127
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:05,032
Your father and mother
had left you alone...

128
00:21:05,277 --> 00:21:06,767
and it was l who
took care of you.

129
00:21:16,022 --> 00:21:21,016
Pick up the gun and fire at me.

130
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:23,422
Pick it up, l say!

131
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:43,613
Thanks a lot, Miss Shalu.
Bittu means more than my life to me.

132
00:21:45,084 --> 00:21:46,847
Why do you say such things?

133
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:49,144
Because of this incident,
l have found a friend.

134
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:53,425
Dad! She's so grown up...
how can she be my friend?

135
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:55,523
Why not? Come here!

136
00:21:59,699 --> 00:22:02,532
We'll play together and
become good friends.

137
00:22:02,702 --> 00:22:04,567
Will you play with me?
- Of course.

138
00:22:06,072 --> 00:22:07,061
Did you find something?

139
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,772
Sorry, sir.
We found their dead bodies.

140
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,802
We cannot understand this.

141
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,740
Whenever we have recognized
the attackers...

142
00:22:15,014 --> 00:22:18,609
they have been found dead
the next day.

143
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:21,214
There is someone very dangerous
behind all this.

144
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:23,819
Look... l've brought the ball.

145
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,793
Someone is targeting
the innocent child.

146
00:22:30,196 --> 00:22:38,695
Could there be an enemy
trying to get even, sir?

147
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:40,833
My money is my enemy.

148
00:22:49,582 --> 00:22:52,278
Let's play here.
- Let's play in the garden.

149
00:22:52,551 --> 00:22:55,213
No. l'm scared of the guards there.

150
00:22:55,521 --> 00:22:58,649
Aren't you scared of them?
- Why must l be scared?

151
00:22:58,924 --> 00:23:02,416
l am. All the children in
my school are afraid of them.

152
00:23:02,695 --> 00:23:04,595
This is why l don't
have any friends.

153
00:23:04,964 --> 00:23:06,397
Do they accompany you
to the school also?

154
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:08,929
Yes, wherever l go.

155
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:10,930
Or the devil
will take me away.

156
00:23:11,137 --> 00:23:13,799
Devil? Who says it
will take you away?

157
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:15,334
My father says so.

158
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:25,547
You will not touch the ball.

159
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:28,685
Haven't l told you?

160
00:23:31,824 --> 00:23:34,190
Bittu... Go and get the ball.

161
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:46,494
l am your friend right?
Then go.

162
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:01,753
Get 20 more guards here.

163
00:24:02,021 --> 00:24:04,216
10 there and 10 there.

164
00:24:05,658 --> 00:24:07,455
What are you doing?

165
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:14,094
Bittu is already scared. And your
going to get more guards?

166
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,630
Then what am l supposed
to do?

167
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:18,231
l want to protect my child.

168
00:24:18,504 --> 00:24:21,439
ln the process of saving your child,
you're being his enemy.

169
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,334
He'll die before anybody
else can finish him.

170
00:24:24,577 --> 00:24:26,636
So what am l supposed to do?

171
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:29,147
l can't even think straight.

172
00:24:29,548 --> 00:24:31,743
l am ready to give away
all my money,...

173
00:24:32,184 --> 00:24:34,311
but no one should
take my child away.

174
00:24:34,854 --> 00:24:38,051
He is my real wealth.
And my last hope for happiness.

175
00:24:38,357 --> 00:24:40,450
Look friend, l have got the ball.

176
00:24:41,594 --> 00:24:45,462
Dad, you said that there is a devil.
But l found no one there.

177
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:46,528
You went there alone?

178
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:50,393
Well done!
Now you are my brave friend.

179
00:24:51,737 --> 00:24:54,205
No need to frighten him anymore.

180
00:24:56,675 --> 00:24:57,801
Here's what l suggest we do.

181
00:24:58,244 --> 00:25:01,111
60 miles from here
is a boarding school.

182
00:25:01,413 --> 00:25:02,573
l teach there.

183
00:25:02,882 --> 00:25:07,080
No one comes there without permission.
Let him join our school.

184
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:14,988
Who can stop the criminals from
kidnapping my son from school?

185
00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:17,252
Please trust me.
Nothing will happen.

186
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,697
l'll call the Principal tomorrow.
You can talk it over with him.

187
00:25:37,616 --> 00:25:39,413
Where are they taking Bittu?

188
00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:47,091
We know they don't tell you much.
But you can tell us this much.

189
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:50,856
We'll pay you 500,000.

190
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:54,156
No! l won't be a traitor!

191
00:26:15,654 --> 00:26:20,284
No... don't do this!
l'll tell you!

192
00:26:20,626 --> 00:26:21,854
Well done, my boy.

193
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:30,826
You've proved to be intelligent.
You deserve 500,000.

194
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:43,844
Sorry, sir, but no one can
be trusted in such affairs.

195
00:26:46,552 --> 00:26:48,110
This is the hostel.

196
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:54,848
This is the wall of the compound.
And this road leads to the city.

197
00:26:55,894 --> 00:26:57,759
Anyone could scale the wall.

198
00:26:57,997 --> 00:27:00,261
No, no one can even
come near the gate

199
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:04,625
lt's guarded 24 hours.

200
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:11,000
Even otherwise, it's dangerous
to loiter around outside.

201
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,740
Well done.

202
00:27:19,618 --> 00:27:21,279
Here is the money.

203
00:27:30,863 --> 00:27:36,096
Now get rid of him.

204
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:59,853
You?
- Remember me?

205
00:28:00,926 --> 00:28:01,688
Yes.

206
00:28:02,628 --> 00:28:05,859
How much money is that?
- 500,000.

207
00:28:06,198 --> 00:28:10,294
Whose is it?
- Yours.

208
00:28:15,574 --> 00:28:19,635
This makes it 500,000
plus 5 Rupees.

209
00:28:22,614 --> 00:28:25,105
How about uncle...?
- To hell with him!

210
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:44,028
Quit town... or uncle's
not going to spare you.

211
00:28:56,882 --> 00:29:00,215
Now, only l know the secret.

212
00:29:47,266 --> 00:29:48,358
Who is it?

213
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:53,597
Vijay! Come in.

214
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:59,767
Doing well, aren't you?
- The population explosion, you see.

215
00:30:00,078 --> 00:30:02,569
Which leads to dishonesty.

216
00:30:02,848 --> 00:30:07,376
People now know nothing about
hard work, they're all dishonest.

217
00:30:09,922 --> 00:30:12,152
The double M.A. degree...
for Kamal.

218
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:16,492
He hasn't got beyond Class 7.
But he's a millionaire's son.

219
00:30:16,995 --> 00:30:21,125
He's going to be happy
with a fake degree.

220
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:24,431
He's going to throw
his weight around.

221
00:30:24,937 --> 00:30:30,705
He's not alone. Here's Niranjan,
who failed four times in Class 10.

222
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:34,111
He wants a First Class degree
in Bachelors of Science.

223
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:36,274
He has a rich man for
a brother-in-law...

224
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:39,015
he'll land a good job.

225
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:46,285
Alas! Those with genuine degrees
will go begging.

226
00:30:46,658 --> 00:30:49,718
They'll bribe others
to land jobs.

227
00:30:50,462 --> 00:30:55,263
Corruption and dishonesty is
what makes the world tick.

228
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:58,331
So be it.
Don't try to prevent it.

229
00:30:59,671 --> 00:31:06,440
Now let's talk about my business.
Any news on the principal?

230
00:31:06,745 --> 00:31:10,647
Yes, l've found a solution.

231
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:17,250
Look! This is the Principal.

232
00:31:17,723 --> 00:31:20,317
And now listen to what l say.

233
00:31:20,892 --> 00:31:24,020
The Principal's name
is Om Prakash Sharma.

234
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:26,326
He hails from Dhanakpur.

235
00:31:27,065 --> 00:31:31,559
He used to have a close friend
20 years ago, Colonel Ranjit.

236
00:31:32,004 --> 00:31:36,270
Ranjit's wife was dead
and he had only a son, Ram.

237
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:40,606
Ranjit was called
to the battle front.

238
00:31:41,113 --> 00:31:46,779
Before leaving, he handed his son
to his sister, Seema.

239
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:49,653
Since Ranjit died in war...

240
00:31:50,055 --> 00:31:56,517
so the Principal decided to look
after the Colonel's son.

241
00:31:56,895 --> 00:32:04,358
But his aunt Seema had gone to Canada
and taken the boy with her.

242
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:09,699
The Principal went there to find them.
But he didn't succeed.

243
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:16,206
The aunt's car met
with an accident.

244
00:32:16,448 --> 00:32:18,541
The car fell in a gorge.

245
00:32:18,884 --> 00:32:24,754
And nobody knows anything
about their fate.

246
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,654
So Ram died?
- Right.

247
00:32:32,297 --> 00:32:34,094
And l've got to impersonate Ram.

248
00:32:35,701 --> 00:32:39,364
Now where have l spent
20 years of my life?

249
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:46,636
You spent 6 years in Canada...

250
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,875
and then went to England
for education.

251
00:32:52,818 --> 00:32:56,879
Later you returned to America
for 5 years for education, too.

252
00:32:57,389 --> 00:33:00,552
You have now returned to lndia.

253
00:33:00,892 --> 00:33:04,487
l've prepared all the
certificates and passports.

254
00:33:04,863 --> 00:33:08,128
You have just to put
your signature on them.

255
00:33:09,901 --> 00:33:13,393
You've done it for me.
Thanks!

256
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:18,339
But there's a problem.
- Problem?

257
00:33:19,244 --> 00:33:22,975
The Principal has a
daughter named Anju...

258
00:33:24,182 --> 00:33:28,243
two years younger than Ram.
She used to play with him as a child.

259
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:34,489
Ram must've been 8 years of age
then, and Anju was about 6.

260
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:38,493
She's now a young girl.

261
00:33:39,264 --> 00:33:45,999
She's bound to meet you and bring up
stories of their childhood.

262
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,431
l can't help you in this case.

263
00:33:51,877 --> 00:33:57,782
l don't know what
transpired between them.

264
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:02,511
No problem, l'll deal with it.

265
00:34:03,922 --> 00:34:08,757
You've worked a miracle, uncle.
May you live to be 100.

266
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:17,762
Don't curse me, son.
l don't want to last long.

267
00:34:23,542 --> 00:34:30,311
Be careful, Vijay...

268
00:34:31,082 --> 00:34:32,174
lest you slip...

269
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:34,442
and then you won't know
how to save yourself.

270
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,215
Why bother about all that?

271
00:34:51,403 --> 00:34:54,031
Help the blind to cross the road.

272
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:00,471
l'll help you across.

273
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,084
What is it?
- Uncle has sent for you.

274
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:11,316
l've just spent 6 months in prison.
What does he want me to do?

275
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:15,526
lt's an urgent job.
- He always has an urgent job.

276
00:35:15,927 --> 00:35:17,360
But l'll go home first.

277
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,028
ls everything ready there?
- Of course!

278
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:26,600
Brother!

279
00:35:33,645 --> 00:35:35,374
You have grown up in six months.

280
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:39,141
Mother...

281
00:35:40,418 --> 00:35:41,680
She's a nice girl.

282
00:35:44,322 --> 00:35:46,950
Brother!

283
00:35:48,493 --> 00:35:49,687
What's the matter with him?

284
00:35:50,328 --> 00:35:53,354
Nothing, my foot's slippery.

285
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:59,198
Be careful, lest you fall again.
Even the hospitals won't accept you.

286
00:35:59,738 --> 00:36:00,636
Bring my stuff in.

287
00:36:03,308 --> 00:36:05,776
My son!
- Mother!

288
00:36:10,015 --> 00:36:11,778
My son!

289
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:18,011
You're shedding tears, mom...
You know l hate to see you cry.

290
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:22,385
There! She's crying too!

291
00:36:22,761 --> 00:36:24,490
What is all this about?
You start crying when l arrive!

292
00:36:24,729 --> 00:36:26,663
Not done! Certainly not!

293
00:36:27,566 --> 00:36:29,090
Looks like Laxmi isn't
looking after you.

294
00:36:30,769 --> 00:36:34,205
Now that l'm here,
everything will be okay.

295
00:36:34,606 --> 00:36:37,097
You're crying too, son.

296
00:36:41,546 --> 00:36:44,674
You have an appointment with
the Commissioner this evening.

297
00:36:45,383 --> 00:36:48,216
l know. Go on.
l'll join you later.

298
00:36:51,189 --> 00:36:53,214
Are you leaving again?

299
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,791
You have come home after
six months, my son.

300
00:36:59,097 --> 00:37:02,066
And you're already
talking about leaving.

301
00:37:05,337 --> 00:37:09,467
What can l do, mom?
People are driving me crazy

302
00:37:09,808 --> 00:37:11,070
Know something?

303
00:37:11,376 --> 00:37:12,843
Look at any newspaper of the
big countries of the world...

304
00:37:13,144 --> 00:37:18,776
America, France, ltaly, Russia...
you'll find my pictures in them.

305
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,348
And each paper says,
''We Want Sunil!''

306
00:37:23,555 --> 00:37:26,683
Are you in good health?

307
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:31,220
What's happened to my health?

308
00:37:31,896 --> 00:37:34,057
Look at me!
l've become so fat.

309
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:35,231
l have just returned from Japan.

310
00:37:35,734 --> 00:37:37,725
Thousands of people
came to see me off.

311
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:39,331
lt was amazing!

312
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:42,898
The president has sent
his regards to you.

313
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:46,335
Look what l've brought for you.
A first class sari!

314
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:48,406
lt's so beautiful.

315
00:37:48,913 --> 00:37:52,212
This one's for you, Rashmi.
And this for you, mom.

316
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:54,179
lt's beautiful, isn't it?

317
00:38:00,759 --> 00:38:03,319
Why are your hands so rough?

318
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:13,631
l've got to shake hands
with thousands of them.

319
00:38:13,972 --> 00:38:16,372
What other reason
could there be?

320
00:38:16,808 --> 00:38:22,007
All right. You're tired, aren't you?
l'll get you a cup of tea.

321
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,248
Yes, l'd love that!

322
00:38:24,516 --> 00:38:26,450
Make it quick...
it's going to be fun.

323
00:38:36,394 --> 00:38:37,952
Why are you crying?

324
00:38:39,297 --> 00:38:41,731
What happened?
Tell me.

325
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:44,526
Why are you crying?

326
00:38:45,537 --> 00:38:49,837
l place you under an oath...
say it.

327
00:38:50,508 --> 00:38:53,306
Mom can't live
without you anymore.

328
00:38:53,812 --> 00:38:57,145
She wakes up in the
middle of the night.

329
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:04,784
She has these nightmares...
that you're in trouble.

330
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:09,720
Nightmares that you are
being held captive...

331
00:39:10,128 --> 00:39:13,427
and you can't escape.

332
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:19,099
Don't leave mom now, brother.

333
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:22,669
Oh no! D'you think l'm sending you
on a dangerous mission, young man?

334
00:39:23,074 --> 00:39:24,632
Even your name will not appear.

335
00:39:25,143 --> 00:39:27,270
Look! There's this school
900 miles away.

336
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:29,046
You'll work there as
a music teacher.

337
00:39:29,347 --> 00:39:32,339
l've already prepared your
fake certificates, degrees etc.

338
00:39:32,884 --> 00:39:37,048
ls there a vacancy for the job?
- lt will be vacant tomorrow.

339
00:39:37,422 --> 00:39:39,913
The teacher there is going to
meet with an accident.

340
00:39:40,158 --> 00:39:41,250
He'll be bed-ridden
for a couple of months.

341
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:47,526
What if the mission is
not over within 2-3 months?

342
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:49,460
The rascal will die then.
Why are you worried?

343
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:52,499
No... no bloodshed.
- All right.

344
00:39:52,704 --> 00:39:53,671
There won't be any blood shed.

345
00:39:53,905 --> 00:39:56,897
But he can fall from the stairs.
Why are you getting worried?

346
00:39:57,175 --> 00:39:58,073
Another thing!

347
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:03,038
There is this beautiful teacher
who's the guardian of the child.

348
00:40:03,414 --> 00:40:05,177
Try and be friends with her.

349
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:09,451
You can flirt as well as
accomplish our mission.

350
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:14,885
Stop!

351
00:40:17,695 --> 00:40:19,993
You cannot take Bittu away!

352
00:40:23,868 --> 00:40:25,096
Stop! l'll shoot you!

353
00:40:28,973 --> 00:40:30,065
Stop...

354
00:41:05,176 --> 00:41:08,805
This man is a retired
army officer.

355
00:41:09,214 --> 00:41:11,648
He has won many medals
for mountain-climbing...

356
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:16,284
as well as escaping
from enemies.

357
00:41:16,955 --> 00:41:20,948
When this man could not
get past your guards...

358
00:41:21,326 --> 00:41:25,729
how can anyone else
escape with your son?

359
00:41:27,365 --> 00:41:30,596
The arrangements seem to be
good enough, Mr. Principal.

360
00:41:32,704 --> 00:41:34,228
But there is a doubt in my mind.

361
00:41:34,973 --> 00:41:38,170
There is a possibility of a
gangster impersonating a teacher.

362
00:41:38,543 --> 00:41:41,376
Or what happens if a teacher
joins ranks with the gang?

363
00:41:42,247 --> 00:41:44,477
You can count on me for that.

364
00:41:44,883 --> 00:41:49,320
All our teachers here
come from decent families.

365
00:41:50,021 --> 00:41:52,512
And new teachers are appointed
only if they are...

366
00:41:52,824 --> 00:41:56,225
recommended by a former teacher
or by a big personality.

367
00:41:56,828 --> 00:41:59,854
Since the former music teacher met
with an accident and is in hospital...

368
00:42:00,098 --> 00:42:01,531
we have a new teacher.

369
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:04,427
This gentleman was recommended
by the former teacher himself.

370
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:11,832
Don't worry! ln a month, your leg
will be fine and you can go home.

371
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:15,136
Doctor... can you let me off
a bit early?

372
00:42:15,513 --> 00:42:18,175
Will l have to stay here
a whole month...?

373
00:42:19,884 --> 00:42:23,650
One month? lmpossible!

374
00:42:23,922 --> 00:42:26,516
l can't get out of bed
for six months!

375
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:29,827
Don't worry!
You'll be all right in a month.

376
00:42:30,161 --> 00:42:33,130
How can l get well?
Do you want me to get killed?

377
00:42:33,331 --> 00:42:35,993
How can you cure me when
l am not going to get well?

378
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:39,360
You can't force me
to recover, can you?

379
00:42:39,704 --> 00:42:42,537
My leg, after all. l can't
have it broken every other day.

380
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:49,173
Am l right?
- Yes, you are.

381
00:42:49,981 --> 00:42:56,648
But the children will miss me.

382
00:42:56,921 --> 00:42:58,183
Don't worry about that!

383
00:42:58,456 --> 00:43:00,117
We have sent another teacher
to take your place.

384
00:43:11,502 --> 00:43:13,402
What's all this about, mister?

385
00:43:13,705 --> 00:43:16,765
There was close scrutiny at the
earlier gate. And you're at it too.

386
00:43:17,075 --> 00:43:19,407
l am only going to
teach in the school.

387
00:43:19,744 --> 00:43:21,905
l am not crossing the borders
and entering another country.

388
00:43:22,246 --> 00:43:25,909
l asked you for the papers.
- Sure. Here you are

389
00:43:29,587 --> 00:43:31,487
l'll be highly obliged
if you tell me...

390
00:43:31,756 --> 00:43:32,814
what are all these measures for?

391
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:40,190
l'm an artist, you see.
A man of very gentle disposition.

392
00:43:40,565 --> 00:43:43,363
All my life, l have
played my instruments.

393
00:43:43,935 --> 00:43:46,961
But you've given me a jolt
by doing this check today.

394
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:51,165
lt's all right.
You may go.

395
00:43:59,283 --> 00:44:00,773
Tell me something, mister...

396
00:44:01,085 --> 00:44:04,782
will l always be checked like this
before going to the class?

397
00:44:05,123 --> 00:44:06,988
Only the Principal will
conduct the interview.

398
00:44:17,201 --> 00:44:21,797
l am delighted that a teacher
like you will work with us.

399
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,967
Although this is a temporary job...

400
00:44:25,276 --> 00:44:27,767
l'll try and make it
permanent for you.

401
00:44:28,246 --> 00:44:30,840
There are big and small
children in the school.

402
00:44:31,115 --> 00:44:32,776
But looking at your
qualifications...

403
00:44:33,051 --> 00:44:36,885
l want you to start teaching
the elder children first.

404
00:44:38,022 --> 00:44:41,048
The younger children, sir.
l love small children.

405
00:44:41,526 --> 00:44:45,929
Their vocal chords are tender...
like freshly planted saplings.

406
00:44:46,297 --> 00:44:50,165
They can be molded
any which way we want to.

407
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:05,406
Well done. The class is over.
Perform the farewell.

408
00:45:09,687 --> 00:45:10,312
Go on now.

409
00:45:14,859 --> 00:45:16,656
So this the one who
will be my friend?

410
00:45:26,104 --> 00:45:27,969
lt's a flower to put in
your hair.

411
00:45:28,206 --> 00:45:29,264
No!
-No?

412
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,370
lt's for eating.

413
00:45:30,575 --> 00:45:32,543
lt's good for the stomach.

414
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:36,676
You probably ate breakfast.
l didn't.

415
00:45:40,952 --> 00:45:44,319
Friendship? She's not even
worthy of being an enemy.

416
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:47,589
We'll see.

417
00:45:50,595 --> 00:45:54,224
Good morning sir.
-Good morning my millionaire.

418
00:45:54,565 --> 00:45:56,897
What?
-l mean son.

419
00:45:57,301 --> 00:46:00,168
l am your music teacher.
l have come to take you away.

420
00:46:00,872 --> 00:46:03,272
l mean to teach you music.

421
00:46:03,908 --> 00:46:06,468
Sir, can l go?
My gym teacher is calling me.

422
00:46:53,324 --> 00:46:57,192
Let me introduce you.

423
00:46:57,695 --> 00:46:59,356
This is the new
music teacher...

424
00:46:59,664 --> 00:47:01,996
and he's the new
P.T. instructor.

425
00:47:12,843 --> 00:47:17,507
This is a school;
not a den for thugs like you.

426
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:21,876
Try to kill me,
and you won't escape either.

427
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,853
That's just what l came
to you tell you, you cur.

428
00:47:26,557 --> 00:47:30,618
Don't you dare disclose my secret.
You won't escape.

429
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:35,731
l'll show you, once l have
the kid in my hands.

430
00:47:38,336 --> 00:47:42,500
Only time will tell whose
hands the kid will fall in.

431
00:48:00,057 --> 00:48:03,185
l'm sorry you didn't win a cup
in the music contest yesterday.

432
00:48:03,494 --> 00:48:06,827
But l can't sing, sir.
- Never mind. l'll teach you.

433
00:48:07,064 --> 00:48:07,996
What am l here for?

434
00:48:08,366 --> 00:48:12,325
l'll make a great musician
out of you.

435
00:48:12,737 --> 00:48:17,640
People will look upon you
as a master of music.

436
00:48:18,342 --> 00:48:21,743
l'll make you scale the dizzy
heights of success in music.

437
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,546
And people will say,
''There comes the Maestro Bittu''

438
00:48:26,784 --> 00:48:27,751
What do you think?

439
00:48:28,953 --> 00:48:29,851
Where's he?

440
00:48:30,888 --> 00:48:33,550
This is how it goes... see?

441
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:36,690
Football has a lot
to do with your eyes.

442
00:48:37,061 --> 00:48:39,655
You kick the ball, even as
you look at the other players.

443
00:48:40,564 --> 00:48:43,124
You didn't win a cup in sports, right?
- Right.

444
00:48:44,068 --> 00:48:47,595
l'll make you the captain
in football in just 6 months.

445
00:48:49,874 --> 00:48:51,068
Now that's the goal there.

446
00:48:52,076 --> 00:48:54,101
And here's the ball.

447
00:48:55,279 --> 00:48:58,612
Keep your eyes on the goalkeeper,
and your feet on the ball.

448
00:48:59,116 --> 00:49:01,744
Here goes... Goal!

449
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:06,783
Where is he?

450
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:09,459
Now listen, son.

451
00:49:10,161 --> 00:49:12,721
There are seven notes
in music, okay?

452
00:49:13,097 --> 00:49:14,724
Join me, when l sing.

453
00:49:26,177 --> 00:49:28,008
Music isn't for tough men.

454
00:49:28,379 --> 00:49:31,576
Football helps you build
a healthy body.

455
00:49:32,016 --> 00:49:34,712
You must've heard of Pele?

456
00:49:35,186 --> 00:49:38,986
l'll make such a champ out of you
that Pele will pale in comparison!

457
00:49:39,523 --> 00:49:40,547
Now's that the ball...

458
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:49,632
A ball made of rock!

459
00:49:51,202 --> 00:49:54,968
Football, my foot! They keep
kicking it around like asses!

460
00:49:56,507 --> 00:49:59,135
Music is meant for the
blue blooded, son.

461
00:49:59,477 --> 00:50:01,672
Musicians are revered by the world.

462
00:50:03,147 --> 00:50:07,447
Let's practice now.
And you mustn't slip away, okay?

463
00:50:07,952 --> 00:50:09,681
This is going to be fun...

464
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:15,490
An electric shock!

465
00:50:28,973 --> 00:50:32,465
Bittu! Come here, son!

466
00:50:32,777 --> 00:50:35,245
Let's learn football!

467
00:50:41,752 --> 00:50:44,312
Be like Pele...
be a champ!

468
00:50:53,664 --> 00:50:54,722
See that?

469
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:57,292
This exercise makes your neck
as thick as a rhinoceros'...

470
00:50:57,601 --> 00:51:00,593
your chest like a bear's,
your blood like a lion's...

471
00:51:00,871 --> 00:51:03,863
eyes like those of a bull and
a nose like that of an elephant.

472
00:51:04,141 --> 00:51:06,701
But the trunk of an elephant
is very long!

473
00:51:11,015 --> 00:51:12,915
Well said!

474
00:51:13,717 --> 00:51:19,314
You will have a nose just like mine
after the exercise l show you now.

475
00:51:22,726 --> 00:51:24,717
These are the parallel-bars.

476
00:51:25,696 --> 00:51:29,962
Now look at the exercise l show you.
Watch the style, okay?

477
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:56,722
Who's responsible
for that mischief?

478
00:51:57,862 --> 00:52:01,764
Speak up!
Or l'll punish all of you.

479
00:52:02,533 --> 00:52:07,561
No, sir. Why punish them?
They're only children.

480
00:52:08,405 --> 00:52:13,775
lt was my fault, not theirs.
l couldn't win over their hearts.

481
00:52:14,612 --> 00:52:16,603
lt's all my fault, sir.
l deserve the punishment.

482
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:19,376
l will not eat today.

483
00:52:29,793 --> 00:52:31,055
Let me eat...

484
00:52:31,896 --> 00:52:34,228
For all you know, l might have to
pull off another stunt tomorrow.

485
00:52:37,501 --> 00:52:39,025
Anything for a meal.

486
00:52:40,037 --> 00:52:42,665
And now for some booze.

487
00:52:53,517 --> 00:52:59,149
l know everything. You aren't eating
because your teacher is hungry!

488
00:53:01,258 --> 00:53:02,725
This trick has misfired!

489
00:53:03,427 --> 00:53:05,827
He's become a hero.

490
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:09,731
Our teacher will dine first;
only then will we eat.

491
00:53:18,676 --> 00:53:23,773
Enough! My tummy's going to explode.
l can't eat anymore.

492
00:53:24,548 --> 00:53:26,106
Not at all.

493
00:53:27,251 --> 00:53:30,687
Who's that?
- Open the door, sir!

494
00:53:31,188 --> 00:53:33,247
The children want to
apologize to you.

495
00:53:40,197 --> 00:53:41,221
What's the problem?

496
00:53:43,934 --> 00:53:48,428
What's happening here?
- Teacher, please forgive us.

497
00:53:48,706 --> 00:53:52,073
Or we won't eat either.
- What !

498
00:53:54,912 --> 00:53:58,643
You haven't had your food only
because your teacher is hungry?

499
00:54:00,351 --> 00:54:05,254
You all may go now...
l have forgiven you.

500
00:54:05,756 --> 00:54:10,284
Go and eat, or it will
break my heart.

501
00:54:10,894 --> 00:54:17,629
Let's go...
- No! Wait a moment, children.

502
00:54:18,435 --> 00:54:23,429
Apologize to your teacher and
feed him with your own hands.

503
00:54:23,707 --> 00:54:26,175
No! l'll eat on my own!
Go on.

504
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:30,847
No. The teacher won't eat,
because he is angry.

505
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:34,448
l'm not angry, my son.
l swear, l'm not!

506
00:54:34,718 --> 00:54:37,186
Don't make him take an oath...
Just feed him!

507
00:54:37,521 --> 00:54:41,924
Every child will feed
the teacher a puri.

508
00:54:42,192 --> 00:54:45,059
One puri each?!
- Right! One each.

509
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:48,894
Go on... keep it up!

510
00:54:49,233 --> 00:54:50,222
Well done!

511
00:54:57,307 --> 00:54:59,332
With all the love...
feed him.

512
00:55:01,512 --> 00:55:05,881
Like this... one more.

513
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:10,210
Go on, children.

514
00:55:11,455 --> 00:55:16,950
Not more than one, okay?
Good boys.

515
00:55:17,494 --> 00:55:20,258
He's terribly hungry...
Feed him.

516
00:55:21,832 --> 00:55:25,563
May you be ruined!
May worms feast on you!

517
00:55:26,203 --> 00:55:28,535
lf l don't make you eat
all the food in the world...

518
00:55:28,806 --> 00:55:30,068
l'm not Ram!

519
00:55:30,507 --> 00:55:33,999
l'd rather starve all my life
than ever eat again!

520
00:55:34,344 --> 00:55:37,006
l've got some food
for you, l say!

521
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,745
Where do l keep it?
- Go on... get out.

522
00:55:45,989 --> 00:55:47,456
Get the hell out of here!

523
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:53,826
Music is the treasure
no thief can ever steal.

524
00:55:55,232 --> 00:55:59,601
Music is magic. lt is more powerful
than every other spell.

525
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:03,233
Music makes stones melt.
lt brings estranged hearts together.

526
00:56:03,474 --> 00:56:07,240
lt can light lamps and breathe life
into those who are dead!

527
00:56:09,446 --> 00:56:12,279
l'm getting late for class.
Bye.

528
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:15,543
She seems to be pretty
cheerful today.

529
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,584
l must get cracking then.

530
00:56:18,922 --> 00:56:21,015
Do you understand, children?

531
00:56:23,026 --> 00:56:26,792
Well, never mind. l'll explain it
tomorrow. Class is dismissed.

532
00:56:27,965 --> 00:56:30,365
l must attend to a
personal matter today.

533
00:56:40,043 --> 00:56:47,814
''What favor has life shown me?''

534
00:56:48,185 --> 00:56:51,916
''l can neither live...
nor die''

535
00:56:52,322 --> 00:56:56,190
''Such is the sorrow
it has given me''

536
00:56:56,894 --> 00:57:04,630
''What favor has life
shown to me?''

537
00:57:05,002 --> 00:57:13,171
''l can neither live nor die;
such is the sorrow it has given me''

538
00:57:30,527 --> 00:57:33,928
''l have lost everything l had''

539
00:57:34,398 --> 00:57:38,095
''What do l possess?''

540
00:57:38,802 --> 00:57:46,402
''Pain and agony;
a thirst that is not quenched''

541
00:57:46,944 --> 00:57:55,113
''Only l know of the
poisons l have drunk''

542
00:57:55,552 --> 00:58:03,425
''Neither do l live nor die...
such is the sorrow it has given me''

543
00:58:17,074 --> 00:58:18,063
C'mon!

544
00:58:29,186 --> 00:58:32,986
''Like those whose fires
are extinguished...''

545
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:37,156
''l was lit up again''

546
00:58:37,427 --> 00:58:45,163
''This is how life
has treated me''

547
00:58:49,339 --> 00:58:50,397
What is he up to?!

548
00:58:50,707 --> 00:58:54,108
''Who has ever sought
life in death?''

549
00:58:54,478 --> 00:59:02,647
''Neither does it let me live nor die;
such is the sorrow it has given me''

550
00:59:22,306 --> 00:59:26,072
''l was loyal in love''

551
00:59:26,443 --> 00:59:30,209
''And how have l been punished''

552
00:59:30,547 --> 00:59:38,283
''How my friends have
let me down''

553
00:59:39,323 --> 00:59:47,196
''l have sealed my lips.
l will speak of nothing''

554
00:59:47,564 --> 00:59:55,664
''Neither can l live, nor die...
such is the grief l bear''

555
00:59:56,073 --> 01:00:03,809
''What has my life ever given me?''

556
01:00:04,214 --> 01:00:12,451
''Neither does it let me live nor die;
such is the sorrow it has given me''

557
01:00:21,552 --> 01:00:23,315
May l ask you a question?

558
01:00:25,823 --> 01:00:28,121
Why are you so sad?

559
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:34,891
What will you do if you know?
My wound has turned dangerous.

560
01:00:35,866 --> 01:00:38,300
He has started acting!

561
01:00:38,936 --> 01:00:42,633
And whoever helps those
who suffer?

562
01:00:42,907 --> 01:00:44,397
You can tell me.

563
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:47,072
lt's about Sarla.
- Sarla?

564
01:00:48,379 --> 01:00:51,837
Sarla? Now where did
Sarla spring from?

565
01:00:52,116 --> 01:00:58,419
We met in the valleys of Kashmir
and were drawn to each other.

566
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:02,023
l looked into her eyes,
and she into mine.

567
01:01:03,394 --> 01:01:07,296
lt started snowing...
And l held her hand!

568
01:01:07,598 --> 01:01:10,158
He has grabbed her hand!

569
01:01:10,467 --> 01:01:13,903
Our bodies were on fire...
She tried to free her hand.

570
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:17,572
l drew her closer
and embraced her...

571
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:21,309
and she started crying bitterly!

572
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:29,877
She said, ''l love You, Laxman;
l can't live without you''

573
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:31,276
What happened then?

574
01:01:31,588 --> 01:01:33,886
Go on, you dog!
What happened then?

575
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:38,518
And then, we didn't even
know how the days passed.

576
01:01:39,463 --> 01:01:43,490
Stories of our love
were all over Kashmir.

577
01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:47,464
Must've been your old man!
Well then?

578
01:01:47,771 --> 01:01:55,007
And then, l don't know what
evil-eye cast a spell on our love.

579
01:01:55,612 --> 01:02:04,077
She left me abruptly.
She walked out, without a word.

580
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:09,686
On whose shoulder
do l cry now?

581
01:02:10,027 --> 01:02:13,019
Where do l go?

582
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:18,527
Loneliness and tears will not
drive your sorrows away.

583
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:24,738
So what am l to do?
- l'll tell you.

584
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:28,972
Just get ready.
- Ready?

585
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:35,318
Yes. l'm going shopping.
Come along and help me.

586
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:49,031
Shopping in the city?
Get ready, Bittu!

587
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,591
That cur has done it!

588
01:02:53,771 --> 01:02:56,001
l must think of something too.
Or else...

589
01:02:58,609 --> 01:03:00,668
The principal has sent for you.

590
01:03:04,681 --> 01:03:05,909
Have you sent for me, Sir?

591
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:18,219
A surprise for you..
You were her childhood-friend.

592
01:03:18,595 --> 01:03:21,189
That's my daughter, Anju!

593
01:03:21,598 --> 01:03:25,864
Anju will surely
come to meet you....

594
01:03:26,203 --> 01:03:28,103
and she'll talk about
your childhood days.

595
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:32,140
l can't help you here.

596
01:03:34,445 --> 01:03:40,247
Anju! You have grown up so much!
You are beautiful and...

597
01:03:40,551 --> 01:03:45,614
Never mind. You have been very cruel.
- What have l done?

598
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:48,084
You disappeared when you were a kid.
And you meet me when you've grown up!

599
01:03:48,425 --> 01:03:51,360
l have at least reappeared.
Not anyone else in my shoes.

600
01:03:51,595 --> 01:03:55,554
Why not?
- Dad will answer that. Not me.

601
01:03:55,966 --> 01:03:59,265
lf you ask again, l'll disappear now
and reappear when l'm an old man.

602
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:04,463
l won't. But l did
miss you so much!

603
01:04:04,741 --> 01:04:06,208
Did you meet any of our
childhood friends?

604
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:10,640
A couple of them, all right.
- Did you meet Yousuf?

605
01:04:10,948 --> 01:04:15,647
Yousuf? He went away
to France, didn't he?

606
01:04:16,053 --> 01:04:18,715
And Deepak went away to America.
Did you meet him then?

607
01:04:19,123 --> 01:04:22,752
Wasn't Deepak with Suresh?
- Who is Suresh?

608
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,689
The one we used to snatch
the sweets from.

609
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:29,865
How about Jimmy?
Ever run into him?

610
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:32,635
He's roaming the streets
of Paris with Suresh.

611
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,561
Now who's Suresh?
l can't remember.

612
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:37,238
That fat, rolly-polly chap...?
Remember?

613
01:04:38,175 --> 01:04:41,770
Where have you been all these days?
- With Suresh.

614
01:04:42,746 --> 01:04:48,776
Suresh again.
Why didn't you write me?

615
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:53,217
l was about to but Suresh said to
wait until l became someone.

616
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:55,148
Who?
-Suresh.

617
01:04:57,961 --> 01:05:01,829
Who is Suresh?
-Okay. l should go. l left class.

618
01:05:02,132 --> 01:05:04,157
Okay Anju. l'll meet you
after class.

619
01:05:06,103 --> 01:05:09,595
Daddy who is this Suresh?
-Probably on of your childhood friends.

620
01:05:40,003 --> 01:05:42,471
The piano is not working.

621
01:05:42,906 --> 01:05:45,898
Could you please send it
to the city for repairs?

622
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:49,536
The children's classes
are suffering, you know?

623
01:05:49,846 --> 01:05:51,473
l'll send it right away.

624
01:06:05,696 --> 01:06:09,496
A plan to kidnap Bittu under the
pretext of getting the piano fixed?

625
01:06:09,766 --> 01:06:11,324
Where are they taking Bittu?

626
01:06:15,606 --> 01:06:17,972
You look very beautiful.

627
01:06:20,611 --> 01:06:23,546
You'll see when all
my dresses are here.

628
01:06:23,847 --> 01:06:26,315
Your dresses?
- l'm going to get them from the city.

629
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,541
To the city, l see!

630
01:06:31,188 --> 01:06:34,919
Are you going downtown?
Don't go.

631
01:06:35,692 --> 01:06:37,819
Suresh's fiancee
went downtown once.

632
01:06:38,128 --> 01:06:40,790
Suresh?
- Our friend... remember?

633
01:06:41,098 --> 01:06:43,259
Her clothes were snatched
on her way to town.

634
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:46,270
And she remained in the same
set of clothes for 16 days!

635
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:49,262
Wasn't she stinking?!
Their engagement broke.

636
01:06:51,642 --> 01:06:57,877
May l join you?
- Really? But...

637
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:04,248
l hate it when someone
fools around with girls.

638
01:07:04,755 --> 01:07:06,882
Laxman shouldn't have
done that to Shalu.

639
01:07:07,424 --> 01:07:10,257
What has he done?
- He wagered a bet with me...

640
01:07:10,761 --> 01:07:14,356
that he'd seduce Shalu
with his charms. And he did.

641
01:07:14,965 --> 01:07:18,059
Laxman is a fraud
when it comes to girls.

642
01:07:18,435 --> 01:07:21,563
He pretends as if he's
undergoing great sorrow...

643
01:07:21,938 --> 01:07:24,930
and the girls fall for him.
- That's very bad.

644
01:07:27,511 --> 01:07:31,914
Back in Meerut, he won 300 bucks
from me. For a girl called Laxmi.

645
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:36,045
She still rues the
day she met him.

646
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:39,749
ln Delhi, he won 200 bucks
over a girl called Ranjita.

647
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:42,581
She packed her bags and went
to the railway station for him.

648
01:07:42,893 --> 01:07:44,485
She hasn't yet returned.

649
01:07:44,895 --> 01:07:49,628
And there is Susheela in Bombay.
A married woman with 2 kids.

650
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,299
He entrapped her too!

651
01:07:51,668 --> 01:07:53,966
Her husband would have divorced her
if l didn't get there on time.

652
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:56,137
l asked him to forgive her
because it was all part of a bet.

653
01:07:56,673 --> 01:07:58,766
What a disgusting man!
- Just disgusting?

654
01:07:59,076 --> 01:08:03,137
You wouldn't even utter his name
if you heard the whole story!

655
01:08:03,547 --> 01:08:07,415
ln any case, he will reap as he sows.
Why must l bad-mouth him?

656
01:08:07,951 --> 01:08:10,977
Go and take that bath.
l'll go and say my prayers.

657
01:08:11,221 --> 01:08:13,189
l must pray after talking
about such a dirty man.

658
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:26,499
Sorry, Bittu. But l must render you
unconscious to dump you in the piano.

659
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:29,495
How about the piano?

660
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:32,367
Later. Let's bathe
in the river first.

661
01:08:32,743 --> 01:08:35,678
Because its waters are sacred.

662
01:08:35,979 --> 01:08:38,743
Anyone who bathes in it
gets rid of his sorrow...

663
01:08:38,982 --> 01:08:40,950
and his wishes are
fulfilled too.

664
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:43,548
The water must be terribly cold.

665
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:49,119
And we have no swim-suits either.
- l'm here with you.

666
01:08:49,526 --> 01:08:51,426
Let me turn my face away.

667
01:08:51,695 --> 01:08:53,390
You can take off your clothes
and take a plunge.

668
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:54,962
Very well.

669
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:01,234
C'mon!

670
01:09:02,906 --> 01:09:05,704
My foot!
- What does that mean?

671
01:09:05,976 --> 01:09:09,503
You tried to fool me
with a false love-story!

672
01:09:10,247 --> 01:09:12,738
What are you talking about?
- Really?

673
01:09:13,049 --> 01:09:17,145
You laid a bet with Ram
that you'd seduce me.

674
01:09:17,521 --> 01:09:18,886
That you'd make a fool out of me.

675
01:09:19,122 --> 01:09:22,580
You can rot in that water
all your life now!

676
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:25,990
That's not true!

677
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:28,593
My clothes! How will
l reach the hostel like this?

678
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:31,533
Ram! The bloody swine!

679
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:38,234
Here is where the
great musician bathes!

680
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:43,036
Bastard! Fight me like a man!
Why land me in the waters?

681
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:45,070
Like a man, eh?

682
01:09:45,449 --> 01:09:48,816
You made a 150-odd kids feed me...
that was manliness, was it?

683
01:09:49,286 --> 01:09:51,948
Stay in that water for 150 days!

684
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:56,520
Try to get out and l'll have posters
printed with you in the nude!

685
01:09:57,027 --> 01:10:01,157
l was going to the city anyway,
to have that piano repaired.

686
01:10:02,098 --> 01:10:03,190
You...?

687
01:10:03,467 --> 01:10:05,435
C'mon... come on out!

688
01:10:06,203 --> 01:10:09,434
There come the kids.

689
01:10:09,873 --> 01:10:12,273
They couldn't have seen
a teacher like you.

690
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:14,472
Must l call them?
- No!

691
01:10:14,845 --> 01:10:17,405
No? So take a dip!

692
01:10:17,614 --> 01:10:18,103
No!

693
01:10:18,348 --> 01:10:19,076
Go on!

694
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:31,084
What if they find
Bittu in the piano?

695
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,800
What's in the truck?
- What's in it?

696
01:10:40,303 --> 01:10:42,271
lt's a piano.
We are taking it for repairs.

697
01:10:46,209 --> 01:10:50,703
The city... we must go there.
- ln a hurry. Please let us pass.

698
01:11:01,558 --> 01:11:05,358
Sir... what was that...?
- A piano they're taking for repairs.

699
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:08,060
We have the principal's
daughter as witness.

700
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:17,467
Suresh has proved to be good friend.
- Who's that?

701
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:20,838
You keep forgetting,
don't you?

702
01:11:23,713 --> 01:11:25,340
Want me to show you
something more about him?

703
01:11:26,249 --> 01:11:28,979
Just catch up with
that truck ahead.

704
01:12:02,619 --> 01:12:07,386
Ram, my friend.
You win.

705
01:12:07,757 --> 01:12:12,421
500 Rupees. You were right.

706
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:17,956
You could instigate Shalu
into hating me.

707
01:12:19,336 --> 01:12:22,237
He really hates me now.

708
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:25,599
For the first time in my life,
l had found a friend.

709
01:12:26,242 --> 01:12:32,408
She was a ray of hope.
You have deprived me of her.

710
01:12:32,716 --> 01:12:35,617
Very well. Best of luck to you.

711
01:12:35,885 --> 01:12:38,319
There's nothing here for me now.
l'm going away...

712
01:12:47,797 --> 01:12:51,665
l couldn't ever imagine
that you'd be such a liar!

713
01:12:52,135 --> 01:12:55,298
lf a teacher lies like this...
what will the children do?

714
01:12:56,473 --> 01:12:57,337
But...

715
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:22,355
Your resignation?
- Yes. l'm leaving.

716
01:13:23,266 --> 01:13:27,202
No! You will not go away!

717
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:30,164
lt was he who lied to me!
How am l to blame?

718
01:13:30,874 --> 01:13:31,898
l...

719
01:13:34,277 --> 01:13:40,807
l'm terribly sorry to
have offended you.

720
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:49,456
Please don't cry.

721
01:13:53,196 --> 01:13:58,566
You won't go away, will you?
- No.

722
01:14:00,403 --> 01:14:06,342
You must come to the
campfire today and sing for us.

723
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:10,544
For the children.

724
01:14:12,015 --> 01:14:15,382
l will surely come.
And will sing, too.

725
01:14:17,287 --> 01:14:19,278
You'll sing, eh?

726
01:14:20,223 --> 01:14:22,691
C'mon... let me hear you sing.

727
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:40,732
God Almighty! You always
straighten things out!

728
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:44,002
Keep doing it and my job
will be accomplished.

729
01:15:12,942 --> 01:15:19,848
Mr. Laxman will
now sing a song.

730
01:15:26,723 --> 01:15:32,127
Wasn't he rather snobbish?
- The music teacher. No joking matter.

731
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:35,129
And now, children...

732
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:38,561
l will...

733
01:15:45,108 --> 01:15:49,772
What's up, Laxman?
- My voice!

734
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:54,009
My voice is choked!
What can l do?

735
01:15:55,118 --> 01:15:56,483
The emperor of music!

736
01:16:01,191 --> 01:16:04,558
You haven't drunk
something wrong, have you?

737
01:16:04,928 --> 01:16:07,954
Like a harmful betel-leaf...
it flattens your vocal cords.

738
01:16:08,965 --> 01:16:11,126
Here... point this finger here.

739
01:16:11,501 --> 01:16:15,528
Because l have a
remedy for everything.

740
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:19,534
You haven't known me yet.
Nor recognized my worth.

741
01:16:20,877 --> 01:16:24,745
''You haven't known me yet;
nor recognized my worth''

742
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:26,881
''The world is crazy about me;
they follow me around...''

743
01:16:27,116 --> 01:16:29,209
''Who has the guts
to take me on?''

744
01:16:29,485 --> 01:16:30,417
''Don't you clash with me...''

745
01:16:30,687 --> 01:16:33,315
''l've never lost
a bout to anyone''

746
01:16:35,892 --> 01:16:39,623
''l always do what
l'm bent on doing''

747
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:43,865
''l'm the one who puts
2 and 2 together to make 5''

748
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:48,169
''l always do what
l want to do''

749
01:16:48,538 --> 01:16:52,599
''l'm the one who puts

750
01:16:55,078 --> 01:16:59,378
''You haven't known me yet;
nor recognized my worth''

751
01:16:59,616 --> 01:17:01,516
''The world's crazy about me;
they follow me around''

752
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:03,776
''They haven't the guts
to take me on''

753
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:07,649
''Don't you clash with me...
l lose to no one''

754
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:14,062
''l always do what
l want to do''

755
01:17:14,397 --> 01:17:18,458
''l'm the one who puts
2 and 2 together to make 5''

756
01:17:18,868 --> 01:17:23,396
''You haven't known me yet;
nor recognized my worth''

757
01:17:45,228 --> 01:17:49,289
''l work my magic even
as l walk down a lane''

758
01:17:49,632 --> 01:17:53,659
''Those who dare defy me
can tell you what l can do''

759
01:17:54,137 --> 01:17:57,903
''l work my magic even
as l walk down the lanes''

760
01:17:58,274 --> 01:18:02,608
''Those who dare defy me
can tell you what l can do''

761
01:18:06,616 --> 01:18:10,985
''l separate the roses
from the thorns''

762
01:18:11,354 --> 01:18:15,620
''l'm the one who puts
2 and 2 together to make 5''

763

''l always do what

764
01:18:20,096 --> 01:18:24,089
''l'm the one who puts

765
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:28,900
''You haven't known me...
nor recognized my worth''

766
01:18:55,865 --> 01:19:00,029
''l could set the waters on fire;
l could grow flowers in stones''

767
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:04,602
''l could cause rains
where no clouds exist''

768
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:08,900
''l could set the waters on fire;
l could grow flowers in stones''

769
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:13,511
''l could cause rains
where no clouds exist''

770
01:19:17,787 --> 01:19:22,053
''l could make the Sun
rise from the West''

771
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:26,555
''l'm the one who puts
2 and 2 together to make 5''

772
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:30,990
''l always do what
l want to do''

773
01:19:31,367 --> 01:19:35,497
''l'm the one who puts
2 and 2 together to make 5''

774
01:20:00,907 --> 01:20:02,636
Lost in thoughts, aren't you?

775
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:07,407
Going to meet the giraffe?
- Well?

776
01:20:07,848 --> 01:20:12,808
Don't mess with the giraffe...
he's not going to bow.

777
01:20:13,086 --> 01:20:16,021
All right. Go ahead.
Why must l bother?

778
01:20:16,456 --> 01:20:22,725
But remember... he's stingy
when it comes to his heart.

779
01:20:22,963 --> 01:20:25,454
How are you concerned with that?
- Not at all.

780
01:20:26,333 --> 01:20:29,825
Forget loving you. He won't even
offer you a glass of water.

781
01:20:37,878 --> 01:20:39,209
You?

782
01:20:42,416 --> 01:20:43,348
Yes, it's me.

783
01:20:44,217 --> 01:20:47,277
At this hour...?
Any work with me?

784
01:20:47,888 --> 01:20:51,289
Can't l see you without any work?
- Sure, you can.

785
01:20:51,792 --> 01:20:54,727
But it's pretty late in the night.

786
01:20:55,028 --> 01:20:58,191
And... l'm feeling sleepy.

787
01:20:58,498 --> 01:21:01,956
We'll have a chat in the morning.
Shall we say ''good night'' then?

788
01:21:02,803 --> 01:21:03,963
This way, please...

789
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:15,504
What people say is true.

790
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:22,120
Forget love, you wouldn't even
offer me a glass of water!

791
01:21:22,389 --> 01:21:24,118
Which bastard wouldn't...?

792
01:21:25,158 --> 01:21:31,222
l mean, why not? l could
give you a jug full of water!

793
01:21:31,498 --> 01:21:33,227
So give it to me.
- At once!

794
01:21:40,307 --> 01:21:41,968
Here you are.

795
01:21:42,409 --> 01:21:43,740
Gulp it down.

796
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,711
Who says l'm stingy?

797
01:21:49,916 --> 01:21:53,215
Want some more?
- No thank you.

798
01:21:53,553 --> 01:21:56,579
That's enough.
- Good. Give that to me.

799
01:21:58,759 --> 01:22:04,356
People will talk, you know.
They're jealous...

800
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,364
Now where is she?

801
01:22:08,235 --> 01:22:09,167
Has she gone out?

802
01:22:12,105 --> 01:22:13,072
Here she is!

803
01:22:20,347 --> 01:22:21,814
She has passed out!

804
01:22:23,116 --> 01:22:24,845
Could it be the water...?

805
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:36,395
A sedative!
lt must be that scoundrel!

806
01:22:38,265 --> 01:22:39,197
What am l going to do?

807
01:22:39,933 --> 01:22:44,302
Yes, l'll drop her home.
That's it.

808
01:22:46,673 --> 01:22:49,574
Come... let me take you home.

809
01:22:51,044 --> 01:22:54,480
Steady... slowly.

810
01:22:55,148 --> 01:23:07,754
''You haven't known me;
nor recognized my worth''

811
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:13,126
''The world is crazy about me;
they're always chasing me''

812
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,096
''Who has the guts
to take me on''

813
01:23:17,971 --> 01:23:22,533
''Don't you clash with me...
l lose to no one''

814
01:23:25,912 --> 01:23:30,815
''l always do what
l want to do''

815
01:23:31,218 --> 01:23:36,121
''l'm the one who puts
2 and 2 together and make 5''

816
01:23:36,556 --> 01:23:41,357
''l always do what
l want to do''

817
01:23:41,761 --> 01:23:46,630
''l'm the one who puts
2 and 2 together to make 5''

818
01:24:20,567 --> 01:24:25,095
''What are you doing at this hour
when everyone else is asleep''

819
01:24:25,438 --> 01:24:29,966
''They'll get to know
when they see you at it''

820
01:24:30,544 --> 01:24:35,675
''What are you doing at this hour
when everyone else is asleep?!''

821
01:24:36,116 --> 01:24:40,849
''They'll get to know
when they see you at it''

822
01:24:46,826 --> 01:24:50,728
''l go around separating
the thorns from the roses''

823
01:24:51,031 --> 01:24:55,661
''l'm the one who puts
2 and 2 together and makes 5''

824
01:24:56,169 --> 01:25:00,902
''l always do what
l want to do''

825
01:25:01,207 --> 01:25:05,906
''l'm the one who puts
2 and 2 together and makes 5''

826
01:25:06,646 --> 01:25:10,912
''l always do what
l want to do''

827
01:25:11,284 --> 01:25:15,812
''l'm the one who puts
2 and 2 together to make 5''

828
01:25:27,681 --> 01:25:31,481
l couldn't even imagine
you would stoop so much!

829
01:25:31,952 --> 01:25:34,284
This is as if you have
slapped me in the face!

830
01:25:34,721 --> 01:25:39,988
You have brought your lineage to
shame with what you have done!

831
01:25:40,494 --> 01:25:44,954
What happens when people get to know
that she spent a night with you...?

832
01:25:45,332 --> 01:25:48,324
l feel like handing you
over to the police.

833
01:25:48,569 --> 01:25:50,560
No!
Police?

834
01:25:54,475 --> 01:26:03,144
lf you feel that l'm a criminal
then l will leave myself.

835
01:26:04,384 --> 01:26:07,945
Today and now.

836
01:26:17,731 --> 01:26:20,859
What happened?
-The principle fired Ram.

837
01:26:21,368 --> 01:26:23,359
Ram? Ram who?

838
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:24,934
The gym teacher.

839
01:26:25,372 --> 01:26:27,499
Gym teacher?
-Yes.

840
01:26:27,741 --> 01:26:31,700
The one who teaches little kids?
-Yes.

841
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:36,916
So you must have found a
fault in him.

842
01:26:37,151 --> 01:26:38,618
No! That can't be!

843
01:26:40,654 --> 01:26:44,920
There has to be a mistake.
He looks so innocent.

844
01:26:45,726 --> 01:26:51,961
Who are we to decide?
We're teachers; not lawyers.

845
01:26:52,199 --> 01:26:54,565
The bell has rung. The children
must be waiting for you.

846
01:26:55,369 --> 01:26:58,065
l must not waste time now.

847
01:27:06,246 --> 01:27:08,510
What have you done, sir?

848
01:27:09,216 --> 01:27:12,185
How could you dismiss
an innocent teacher?

849
01:27:12,686 --> 01:27:15,746
l know what you'll say.

850
01:27:16,123 --> 01:27:20,492
Just that your daughter spent
the night with him, isn't it?

851
01:27:23,564 --> 01:27:29,196
Which father would allow
such a thing?
