462
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,237
A lady has standards
to maintain, you know.

463
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,277
Well, I'm sure that it...
It says right here
in the telegram,

464
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:07,470
"First class."

465
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,538
Don't say nothing
about no coach.
What does it say?

466
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,307
First class.

467
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:14,352
That's right. First class.
Right there in bold writing.

468
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:15,852
So how the hell
did I get coach?

469
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,082
Well, look at
Miss Goody Two-Shoes.

470
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,987
She look better
in the pictures,
if you ask me.

471
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,083
(LAUGHS)

472
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,252
Excuse me.

473
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,151
Do I know you?

474
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,926
Hell, no. But if you
fix yourself up a little...

475
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,091
Taffy!

476
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,596
Miss Angel Davenport. Lord.

477
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,162
Don't try it, man.

478
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,571
I just traveled 19 hours
on a stinking train

479
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,837
from Saint Louis
in a lousy coach seat.

480
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,240
I deeply regret that.

481
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,438
Some jackass
didn't follow my orders.

482
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,778
I did exactly what you...

483
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,045
(GRUNTING EMPHATICALLY)

484
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:51,912
But now that you're here,
Sunshine Ace will take
real good care of you.

485
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,625
Just as soon as we take care
of the legal paperwork.

486
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,489
Now I just so happen
to have your contract.

487
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,828
Now, never mind
all this fine print.

488
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,768
Them just the details.
Sign by the "X."
Give me a pen.

489
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,636
Here. Right there.

490
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,335
Yup.

491
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:21,008
Now that the legal stuff
is out the way, you can
have anything you want.

492
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,315
Anything?
Anything. Just you name it.

493
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,859
White carnations.
White carnations.
You heard the lady.

494
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:31,918
Got you.

495
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:33,696
And my own dressing room.

496
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,596
ACE:
And her own dressing room.

497
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,033
Taffy, come here.
The rest of you niggers,
get back to work.

498
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,593
Come on, Sawed-Off.

499
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,500
MONK: Follow me,
Miss Davenport.

500
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,263

MONK: Look at this shit.
I don't even like you, girl.

503
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:48,378
Get your ass up out of here!
Monk?

504
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:51,244
You know,
we can do this another time.

505
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:54,149
Get your stinky ass up
out of here. You too.
What... No, stop!

506
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,120
You didn't even want to
loan me no money?
Get your ass out, too.

507
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:58,655
What the hell is this?

508
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,418
What the hell is this?

509
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,017
I'm sorry, just...
Right after you,
Miss Davenport.

510
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,354
Thank you, Monk.
You welcome.

Bye.

00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,273
Oh, Rooster.

515
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:24,345
Baby, why you make me
act so bad?

516
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:25,779
Who, me?

517
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:27,779
Yes, you.

518
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,018
You bad boy.

519
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:36,024
Guess I kind of inherited it
from my Uncle Eddie.

520
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,325
Got a weakness for fine women
such as yourself.

521
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:40,762
And that perfume
don't help, either.

522
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:43,062
One second. One second.

523
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:46,035
Bad boy.

524
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,739
Let's head over to the garage.

525
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:53,842
Hey, Ace. Excuse me, man.
I want to...
What?

526
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,870
I want to talk to you
about the piano.

527
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,437
Some of the notes
are still sticking and I...

528
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,449
Don't you touch
that damn piano.

529
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:01,576
That piano is
a bona fide antique.

530
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:05,447
Jelly Roll Morton
brought the house down
with that piano!

531
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,055
If it's good enough
for Jelly Roll,

532
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,288
it's good enough for
a mortician nigger
like yourself.

533
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:13,058
It just needs a little tuning.
I mean, I hit a couple
of bad notes, but...

534
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,598
Let me tell you something.

535
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:17,191
The only reason
why you even here,

536
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:20,262
because Rooster said, "Please,

537
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:25,569
"please let my mortician
friend come play the piano
at your club."

538
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:28,810
That's the only reason
why you here.

No one has.

So you play piano
and write songs.

Yeah, I play a little bit,
just to pass the time.

934
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:46,425
<i>Beginning to feel like</i>
<i>Ms. Jackson done got cloned</i>

935
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,964
<i>Well, it's some real shit</i>
<i>and I'm living it</i>
<i>through this song</i>

936
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,294
<i>A moving vehicle</i>
<i>took my family</i>

937
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,164
<i>As I slept out on the sofa</i>
<i>in the Boom Boom Room</i>

938
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:53,361
<i>I woke up very upset</i>

939
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,563
<i>I throw the covers</i>
<i>back and peek out</i>
<i>through the draperies</i>

940
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:58,073
<i>My daughter, my baby,</i>
<i>my baby mama all escaping me</i>

941
00:52:58,141 --> 00:52:59,870
<i>Like a candle in the wind,</i>
<i>she was my friend</i>

942
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:00,967
<i>She was my passion, never lied</i>

943
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:02,739
<i>Therefore we tried</i>
<i>and tried again</i>

944
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:04,712
<i>But in the end you pay</i>
<i>attention to the pluses</i>

945
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:06,976
<i>But the minuses behind it</i>
<i>make it seem like</i>
<i>you can't win</i>

946

<i>Throw your neck out,</i>

00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:15,655
ROOSTER: Oh, hell, no!

949
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:17,659
All right, I told you
not to do that to...
Give me a sec.

00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:19,217
Okay.

951

952
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:24,327
You got one more time, Cap.
One more time.

<i>Not hardly I'm trying to</i>

00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:32,739
<i>Or that P-U-S-S uss, I say uss</i>

957
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,403
<i>Luther Vandross couldn't make</i>

<i>Smashed, pushed to the limit</i>
<i>Smash and turned it timid</i>

959
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:39,813
<i>And everyone was suffering,</i>
<i>the house was feeling wicked</i>

960
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,681
What is this, the break room?
Get y'all ass back
out there on stage!

961
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:44,845
WOMAN 1: I'm sorry.
WOMAN 2: Oh, God.

962
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:46,013
<i>Now let's fight for it</i>

963
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:48,387
<i>You build it up to</i>
<i>break it down and take it</i>
<i>from the start</i>

964
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:51,018
<i>Repeatedly leading a path</i>
<i>that only ends in the clash</i>

965
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:53,426
<i>Of two stubborn minds,</i>

968
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:57,398
I will cut your ass.
Wait now, wait now.

969

Come on, brother.
Put that chair down, brother.

Oh, you came here

Well... No, I came here
to borrow some bread.

1016
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,657
You know, I owe Ace $85,

1017
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:11,031
but now that he's dead,
my debt is clear. Yeah!

1018
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:14,537
Boy, I feel so good he gone.
Excuse me, but I'm free.

Thank you.

1033
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:03,783
As you may or may not know,
Ace and I had a contract.

1034
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:06,752
And if you take a close look
at this contract,

1035
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:11,260
you are obliged to provide me
one first class ticket
to my next destination

1036
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:13,158
which is Saint Louis,
Missouri.

1037
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:14,353
Mmm-hmm.

1038
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:18,094
And seeing as
how you're now the manager
of this establishment,

1039
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:21,467
the responsibility of honoring
this contract falls upon you.

1040
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:24,132
You know,
it don't make no difference
if Ace is dead or not.

1041
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:27,768
Says so right there
in the fine print.
Let me see that.

1042
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:33,344
I'll have you know that's
a legally-binding obligation
signed by both parties.

1043
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,507
You know what?

1044
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:39,722
You're right.
It obliges you to sing.

1045
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:42,013
And it's your first week.

1046
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:44,082
You still want me to sing?

1047
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,561
You ain't got no choice.
It says so right here
at the top.

1048
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,861
"Club owner hereby
engages artist
for a period of four weeks."

00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,992
In fine print.

1050
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:56,866
As you pointed out,
this is a legally-binding
obligation.

1051
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:01,274
Yeah. Well, of course,
it'll take me
a little while to prepare.

1052
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:03,278
Don't worry about that.
You on tomorrow night, sugar.

1053

Tomorrow?
Tomorrow night, you on.

Tomorrow?
9:00 sharp.

1055
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,249
Why, I need at least a week
to get my band together.

1056
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,513
Oh, sugar, you look so good.
Rooster, please, have a heart.

1057
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:13,317
I'm not ready.
Come on. Don't be late.

1058
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:16,952
Money in the bank.

What's that you playing?

1065
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:39,740
Working on something new.

1066
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:41,807
Sound like some bullshit.

1067
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:44,786
I mean, you really think
the audience is gonna
appreciate that?

1068
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:47,220
Well, Rooster said that
I could play whatever
I wanted to play, so...

1069
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:49,315
No, no. Never mind anything

a little space around here?
