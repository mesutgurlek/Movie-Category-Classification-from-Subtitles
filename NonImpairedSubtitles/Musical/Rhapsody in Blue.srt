1
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:25,314
Jack, can I trade this in for a nickel?

2
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:27,680
Sorry, Georgie,
but I can't use it.

3
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:30,547
Must I hear that number
every day?

4
00:02:33,814 --> 00:02:35,281
George!

5
00:02:35,348 --> 00:02:36,981
Ira, do you got
a nickel?

6
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:38,281
Nope.

7
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:39,981
What's that
- Another Deadwood Dick?

8
00:02:40,047 --> 00:02:42,981
It ain't much good. Say, we better
get back and do our homework.

9
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:44,480
Race you home.

10
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:45,747
Hey, wait a minute!

11
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:01,981
<i>A little more
to the left.</i>

12
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:03,847
<i>Steady now, boys.</i>

13
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,513
How's it coming
up there, Jerry?

14
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,381
Mom!

15
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:12,348
Who's getting
a piano?

16
00:03:12,414 --> 00:03:14,381
It's the Gershwins.

17
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:15,880
We don't have one.

18
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:17,847
Who wants a secondhanded piano?

19
00:03:17,914 --> 00:03:19,580
Come on inside.

20
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,547
What's going on?

21
00:03:28,613 --> 00:03:30,014
Search me.

22
00:03:30,081 --> 00:03:32,348
Gee, a piano.
Some lucky guy.

23
00:03:32,414 --> 00:03:34,547
Hey, that's
our window!

24
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:36,214
No. There must be
some mistake.

25
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:37,580
Let's go see.

26
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:40,547
Now, George, if it's not for
us, don't be disappointed.

27
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:45,414
One piano comes
in the house,

28
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,680
And right away the whole place
is turned upside down on its head.

29
00:03:48,747 --> 00:03:50,480
The house needs music.
I've made up my mind.

30
00:03:50,547 --> 00:03:52,747
Do you play the piano?
Do I?

31
00:03:52,814 --> 00:03:56,647
If your married sister
can have one, why can't we?

32
00:03:56,714 --> 00:04:00,181
So if she has a headache,
I must have one, too.

33
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:03,480
Anyhow, a piano
in the house

34
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:05,480
Is a sign
of culture.

35
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,647
George,
Ira, look out!

36
00:04:08,714 --> 00:04:09,680
Wow!

37
00:04:09,747 --> 00:04:11,747
How many times
- Look out! Look out!

38
00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:13,247
Ira!

39
00:04:13,314 --> 00:04:14,714
Oh, always coming in

40
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,680
With skates
on the carpet. Look.

41
00:04:16,747 --> 00:04:19,414
Hey, Mom, does the piano
belong to us?

42
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Mm-hmm, so long as we can pay
the installments.

43
00:04:22,547 --> 00:04:24,747
Positively we will pay
the installments,

44
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:26,247
And Ira will take
lessons.

45
00:04:26,314 --> 00:04:27,714
Ira?!

46
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,181
Oh, Momma,
have a heart.

47
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:30,714
You heard
what I said.

48
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,880
Gee, do I have to
take them?

49
00:04:32,947 --> 00:04:34,513
You're the oldest.

50
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:55,680
There, now.

51
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,181
Without
even a lesson.

52
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:04,981
1, 2, 3, 4.

53
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:10,214
1, 2, 3, 4.
1, 2, 3, 4.

54
00:05:10,281 --> 00:05:13,448
1, 2, 3, 4.
1...

55
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,348
Don't try to improve upon
the classics, Mr. Gershwin.

56
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,480
Morris, I never saw
such children.

57
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,314
Always wearing out
the cuffs.

58
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,714
And George
- He tears off the buttons.

59
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,214
Look at it.

60
00:05:52,281 --> 00:05:54,480
At their age, they've got
their own worries.

61
00:05:54,547 --> 00:05:55,981
What are you
fixing now?

62
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:57,480
I'm not fixing.
I'm ruining.

63
00:05:57,547 --> 00:05:59,147
Morris, tell George
to go downstairs

64
00:05:59,214 --> 00:06:00,780
And help out
with the bakery.

65
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:02,647
Always
playing music.

66
00:06:02,714 --> 00:06:04,780
I'll go, Mom,
as soon as I'm through.

67
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:07,314
If he wants to play, Momma, let him.

68
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:09,814
You, Ira
- Always with a book under your nose.

69
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,014
Rose, when they're outside,
you want them inside,

70
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,181
So when they're inside,
leave them alone.

71
00:06:14,247 --> 00:06:15,714
Who's
bothering them?

72
00:06:16,914 --> 00:06:19,914
Ah, such a mechanism.
It's too involved.

73
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,647
Can I come in?

74
00:06:22,714 --> 00:06:24,981
You're in already. What is it
- A telephone call?

75
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:26,181
No. Georgie.

76
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:27,580
Yeah?

77
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:30,014
Chico Marx tells me you
should give me a nickel.

78
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,314
What for?

79
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:32,580
I got a message.

80
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:34,547
What kind
of a message?

81
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:36,513
Poppa.

82
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,847
A message always costs.

83
00:06:38,914 --> 00:06:40,448
Thanks,
Mr. Gershwin.

84
00:06:40,513 --> 00:06:42,513
Such a popular
family.

85
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,580
Every day
a telephone call.

86
00:06:45,647 --> 00:06:48,081
Well, what do you know?
At last I got the job-

87
00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:49,580
Relief pianist
in a theater.

88
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:51,081
Who do you
relieve?

89
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:53,814
Chico Marx.

90
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,314
In the whole
neighborhood.

91
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,647
Sonny, I don't
want you to work

92
00:06:57,714 --> 00:06:59,147
In no cheap
vaudeville show.

93
00:06:59,214 --> 00:07:00,647
It's a good job, Mom.

94
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:02,613
A fella has to start
somewhere, Momma.

95
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,247
What a break,
Georgie.

96
00:07:04,314 --> 00:07:07,147
They've got some pretty good acts
over there. Here's one of the songs.

97
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:33,348
Don't pay any attention to
me, son. I just work here.

98
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,714
Excuse me.

99
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,480
You're not a piano
player. You're a juggler.

100
00:07:38,547 --> 00:07:41,480
Come on, give me that tempo, will you?

101
00:07:41,547 --> 00:07:43,880
I don't know what I'd do without
him down there, but I'd rather!

102
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:14,448
Mm-hmm.

103
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:23,448
Stop it. Stop it!

104
00:08:23,513 --> 00:08:25,981
Is that what you learn
in the vaudeville job?

105
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,448
No. I quit that job, but
I'll get another one soon,

106
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:30,981
And it will pay me more
than 15 bucks a week.

107
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:33,480
15 or 50 or 500-
Does that make up

108
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:35,981
For ruining your technique
when you have it in you

109
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:38,047
To become a concert pianist? Does it?

110
00:08:38,114 --> 00:08:39,580
No, but,
professor Franck,

111
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:42,880
I
- I don't want to be just a concert pianist.

112
00:08:42,947 --> 00:08:44,513
Just
a concert pianist.

113
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,680
Oh, I didn't mean it
that way, only...

114
00:08:46,747 --> 00:08:49,448
Well, I want to make the
piano a steppingstone.

115
00:08:49,513 --> 00:08:53,680
A steppingstone
- And where will you step to, Mr. Gershwin?

116
00:08:53,747 --> 00:08:55,414
To-to composition.

117
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,914
So for whom
will you compose-

118
00:08:57,981 --> 00:09:01,214
For ragtime dancers
or for musicians?

119
00:09:01,281 --> 00:09:03,947
I don't know.
Maybe for both.

120
00:09:04,014 --> 00:09:06,448
Seems like everything I
hear sticks in my head.

121
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,081
I want to make
those sounds

122
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,714
Come down through my
fingers and into the keys.

123
00:09:15,547 --> 00:09:17,480
Go on, go on.

124
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,448
You don't have to
say anything.

125
00:09:42,513 --> 00:09:44,814
I- I know
it isn't any good.

126
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,014
Did I say it wasn't
any good?

127
00:09:47,081 --> 00:09:49,513
Professor Franck, you
mean that you really-

128
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,014
Ah, ah, ah. One swallow
does not a summer make...

129
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:56,513
But it is different,
shall I say?

130
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,513
Perhaps it was
music half-formed.

131
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,014
Now, then,
play that Chopin,

132
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:04,081
But without ragging it!

133
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:34,414
That the eyes
of love alone will see

134
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,480
But the smiles that fill
my life with sunshine

135
00:10:38,547 --> 00:10:42,789
Are the smiles

136
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:47,790
That you gave to me

137
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:51,281
They don't like
this stuff.

138
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:52,580
Oh, what's the diff?

139
00:10:52,647 --> 00:10:55,014
We got to make them like
it, the chowderheads.

140
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:56,513
Anyway, it's time
to go home.

141
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,981
Ah, they need something
different. So do we.

142
00:10:59,047 --> 00:11:00,880
Oh, a reformer!
Let's go.

143
00:11:05,314 --> 00:11:07,513
You can address it to Remick
and company. Thank you.

144
00:11:08,914 --> 00:11:11,880
From Honolulu
to...

145
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:15,014
Come and let me rock you
in my cradle of love

146
00:11:15,081 --> 00:11:18,381
And we'll cuddle
all the while

147
00:11:18,448 --> 00:11:20,348
Oh, I want
to love...

148
00:11:29,114 --> 00:11:30,547
No, pick it up,
pick it up.

149
00:11:32,613 --> 00:11:35,981
No, no. It's no-no pep. That's no good.

150
00:11:36,047 --> 00:11:37,647
Did I say
it was good?

151
00:11:37,714 --> 00:11:39,281
I've played about everything we've got.

152
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:42,547
Well, sorry. I've got to
have something with snap.

153
00:11:42,613 --> 00:11:45,047
Say, wait a minute.
How's this?

154
00:11:57,448 --> 00:11:59,680
Hey, that's pretty good! Who wrote it?

155
00:11:59,747 --> 00:12:01,181
I did.

156
00:12:01,247 --> 00:12:03,214
You did? Well!

157
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:09,014
Whew!
Congratulations!

158
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:10,513
I'll take a copy.

159
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,014
Wait a minute.
It isn't published yet.

160
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:14,880
Say, that's an idea.

161
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,747
Mr. Kast, please.

162
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:20,747
Yes, Gershwin.

163
00:12:20,814 --> 00:12:23,880
Oh, so he don't like
any of our numbers.

164
00:12:23,947 --> 00:12:26,613
No, but I played him a song,
and he likes it. It's my own.

165
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,381
Oh, so he likes
something you wrote?

166
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:29,914
Listen, Pinkers,
you're being paid

167
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:33,047
To play Remick numbers,
not your own. Do you mind?

168
00:12:33,114 --> 00:12:35,448
No, we don't want
to publish it!

169
00:12:37,114 --> 00:12:39,047
He doesn't want
to publish it.

170
00:12:39,114 --> 00:12:40,547
Well, that's
his hard luck.

171
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:43,513
Tell him he hasn't got
anything else I want,

172
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:47,047
But if your song ever gets
published, you let me know.

173
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:48,647
Thanks very much.

174
00:12:50,114 --> 00:12:55,480
George.

175
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:57,647
Listen, George, don't
let Kast get you down.

176
00:12:57,714 --> 00:12:59,981
He doesn't know the
first thing about music.

177
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:01,480
You're telling me.

178
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,448
I heard that number you
were playing. It's all right.

179
00:13:04,547 --> 00:13:06,181
Did you really
like it, Bill?

180
00:13:06,247 --> 00:13:07,647
It has the smell
of originality.

181
00:13:07,714 --> 00:13:09,647
Heaven knows that's
rare on these premises.

182
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:11,414
But what am I
going to do?

183
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,513
I've written 5 songs, and
not one of them published.

184
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,513
How old
are you, George?

185
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,281
Old enough.

186
00:13:18,348 --> 00:13:20,448
Don't be
in too great a hurry

187
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:21,947
To set the world
afire.

188
00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:23,448
You'll
fizz yourself out

189
00:13:23,513 --> 00:13:25,414
Like acetylase
powder.

190
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,880
Well, I guess I'm just
wasting the firm's time.

191
00:13:27,947 --> 00:13:29,414
Bill,
I haven't even-

192
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,147
Pardon me. Is this the place
where you get free music?

193
00:13:32,214 --> 00:13:34,114
Well, it's free,
but is it music?

194
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:38,014
What? Oh, I guess
I'm in the wrong place.

195
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:40,014
No, wait a minute.
I'm sorry.

196
00:13:40,081 --> 00:13:42,714
I was just being
funny. Come in.

197
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,081
Do you give away
music here?

198
00:13:46,147 --> 00:13:48,047
Why, any amount of it to professionals.

199
00:13:48,114 --> 00:13:49,513
You're a professional, of course.

200
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,513
Well, I-I'm
going to be.

201
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,214
I have an audition
this afternoon.

202
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:54,381
You don't say.

203
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:57,114
But I'm so nervous
I don't know what to do.

204
00:13:57,181 --> 00:13:58,947
Well, I know
just how you feel.

205
00:13:59,014 --> 00:14:00,947
I was that way
before my first concert.

206
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:02,480
Are you
a concert musician?

207
00:14:02,547 --> 00:14:04,947
How long did it take you
to get over being nervous?

208
00:14:05,014 --> 00:14:06,181
When was your
first concert?

209
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:08,381
About two years
from now, I hope.

210
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:13,348
No, I'm just a song-plugger
here at Remick's.

211
00:14:13,414 --> 00:14:15,714
Pick out something you like,
and I'll play it for you.

212
00:14:17,181 --> 00:14:18,613
Oh, here's one
I know.

213
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,047
This one.

214
00:14:20,114 --> 00:14:21,181
What, again?

215
00:14:21,247 --> 00:14:22,381
Do you know it?

216
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:24,547
I knew it before
it was written.

217
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,580
There are smiles
that make us happy

218
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:35,281
There are smiles
that make us blue

219
00:14:35,348 --> 00:14:39,880
There are smiles that
steal away the teardrops

220
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:45,381
As the sunbeams
steal away the dew

221
00:14:45,448 --> 00:14:47,414
Wait a minute. This song isn't for you.

222
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,780
You've got a voice.

223
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,448
You're wonderful. I never
sang like that before.

224
00:14:51,513 --> 00:14:53,847
I've got ideas
that are different.

225
00:14:53,914 --> 00:14:55,480
When I once
get started,

226
00:14:55,547 --> 00:14:57,214
Nothing will ever
stop me.

227
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:01,714
That sounds a little
stuck-up, doesn't it?

228
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,247
No. I don't think so. I think
you really are different.

229
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,214
Here. Here,
let's try this song.

230
00:15:08,281 --> 00:15:09,647
It's something
I wrote.

231
00:15:09,714 --> 00:15:11,147
Your own?

232
00:15:12,247 --> 00:15:14,814
Swanee

233
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,247
How I love you,
how I love you

234
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:18,847
Let's try it
in that tempo.

235
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:20,513
I'll try.

236
00:15:21,613 --> 00:15:24,247
Swanee

237
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:26,381
How I love you,
how I love you

238
00:15:26,448 --> 00:15:29,047
No, no, no, no, no, no. More like this.

239
00:15:29,114 --> 00:15:31,214
How I love you,
how I love you

240
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:34,680
My dear old
Swanee

241
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:36,047
You see?

242
00:15:36,114 --> 00:15:37,714
Oh, I see
what you mean.

243
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,880
Ok, let's try it
together.

244
00:15:43,914 --> 00:15:46,381
Swanee

245
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:49,047
How I love you,
how I love you

246
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,547
My dear old
Swanee

247
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:52,480
That's it.

248
00:15:52,547 --> 00:15:56,181
I'd give
the world to be

249
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:59,047
Among the folks

250
00:15:59,114 --> 00:16:00,348
in D-I-X-I-E.

251
00:16:00,414 --> 00:16:03,547
Even now my mammy's

252
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:06,181
Waiting for me,
praying for me

253
00:16:06,247 --> 00:16:09,181
Down by the Swanee

254
00:16:09,247 --> 00:16:13,647
The folks up north
will see me no more

255
00:16:13,714 --> 00:16:15,147
When I go-

256
00:16:15,214 --> 00:16:17,914
You can go. Didn't I tell
you to lay off your own songs?

257
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:19,513
But, Mr. Kast-

258
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,047
Don't give me any excuses. I've had
just about enough of you, Gershwin.

259
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:25,081
And I'm tired of playing the
same old songs day in and day out.

260
00:16:25,147 --> 00:16:26,513
Oh, you are?!
Yeah.

261
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,513
From now on, you won't have
to play them. You're fired!

262
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,513
Get out, and don't let me find
you around here when I get back.

263
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,513
A lot he knows
about music.

264
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,513
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm
afraid it was my fault.

265
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,014
It was nothing.
It was bound to come.

266
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:44,513
He doesn't appreciate me
or my music, either.

267
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,314
Now you're
out of a job.

268
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:47,814
Oh, don't worry
about me.

269
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,947
I come from a family that's
moved 16 times in 10 years.

270
00:16:51,014 --> 00:16:52,414
I'm used to changes.

271
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,381
Anyway, I'm sorry,
and I loved your song.

272
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,880
Thanks.

273
00:16:57,947 --> 00:16:59,480
Well, bye.

274
00:16:59,547 --> 00:17:01,047
Uh, good-Bye,
Miss, uh...

275
00:17:01,114 --> 00:17:02,580
Oh, my name is
Julie Adams,

276
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,547
And I live
at the Studio Art Club.

277
00:17:04,613 --> 00:17:07,647
My name is George Gershwin,
and I live in the Bronx.

278
00:17:07,714 --> 00:17:10,680
Here-since
this is the last day.

279
00:17:10,747 --> 00:17:12,448
Thank you.

280
00:17:12,513 --> 00:17:14,480
Well, good-bye.

281
00:17:14,547 --> 00:17:16,480
Good-bye.
Wait a minute!

282
00:17:16,547 --> 00:17:18,714
Here. It's
on the house.

283
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,747
Why, thank you,
Mr. Gershwin.

284
00:17:20,814 --> 00:17:22,480
That's all right.

285
00:17:22,547 --> 00:17:24,480
Well, good-bye.

286
00:17:24,547 --> 00:17:26,480
Good-bye,
Miss Adams.

287
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,981
Mr. Kast, please.

288
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:46,047
Gershwin,
didn't I tell you I-

289
00:17:46,114 --> 00:17:49,181
Mr. Kast, I thought you'd
like to hear it just once more.

290
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:51,247
Swanee

291
00:17:51,314 --> 00:17:53,147
How I love you,
how I love you

292
00:17:53,214 --> 00:17:55,247
Da da da, da da

293
00:18:03,613 --> 00:18:06,081
Now, Morris, what kind
of a career is music?

294
00:18:06,147 --> 00:18:08,281
For pleasure, yes.
For business, no.

295
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:10,580
Such a habit
- Always ripping seams.

296
00:18:10,647 --> 00:18:12,047
It happens,
it happens.

297
00:18:12,114 --> 00:18:14,014
What are you inventing
so much?

298
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:15,480
Who's inventing?
I'm fixing.

299
00:18:15,547 --> 00:18:17,480
Momma, don't discourage
George right now.

300
00:18:17,547 --> 00:18:20,014
For weeks, he's been
pounding the pavements.

301
00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:21,647
He's made some
good contacts.

302
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:23,147
Contacts!

303
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:25,314
Listen, Rose, every man
can't be Andrew Carnegie.

304
00:18:25,381 --> 00:18:26,780
Musicians
the world needs, too.

305
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:28,314
Whose idea was
the piano?

306
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:30,448
But George will need
to make a living.

307
00:18:30,513 --> 00:18:32,647
Give him time. When
he learns music better,

308
00:18:32,714 --> 00:18:34,814
He'll get good jobs.
Such a mechanism.

309
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,247
Professor Franck says he's
almost ready to study in Europe.

310
00:18:37,314 --> 00:18:40,680
Who's going to send him to
Europe-you, Ira? Your father, maybe?

311
00:18:40,747 --> 00:18:42,414
Now, Morris,
you listen to me.

312
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,147
Talk to George. Tell him he should
be learning a dependable business.

313
00:18:45,214 --> 00:18:47,314
Look, Ira. At last
I've got it down in ink.

314
00:18:47,381 --> 00:18:48,281
George.

315
00:18:48,348 --> 00:18:49,647
Rose.

316
00:18:49,714 --> 00:18:54,047
Shh. George, I think your
father wants to talk to you.

317
00:18:54,114 --> 00:18:55,747
What's up?

318
00:18:58,014 --> 00:18:59,414
What is it, Poppa?

319
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,947
Uh, Georgie,
sit down, sit down.

320
00:19:02,014 --> 00:19:04,914
Such a mechanism.
It's all mixed up.

321
00:19:04,981 --> 00:19:06,414
What's the matter?

322
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,281
Uh, I don't just know
how to say it.

323
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,780
About getting
a job.

324
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:12,680
Well, something like that.
You see, Georgie,

325
00:19:12,747 --> 00:19:14,914
Your mother thinks
you ought to have

326
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:17,448
Some kind of regular work-that
is, besides your music.

327
00:19:17,513 --> 00:19:19,480
But, Poppa, if he quits his music now,

328
00:19:19,547 --> 00:19:21,448
He might never get
back to it.

329
00:19:21,547 --> 00:19:23,114
Is that so bad?
Well, don't you see?

330
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:25,647
But music means more than
anything else in the world, Poppa.

331
00:19:25,714 --> 00:19:27,314
That's all I was
waiting to hear.

332
00:19:27,381 --> 00:19:28,981
Just wait till they hear
this tune.

333
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:30,480
I'll take it
to Harms the publisher.

334
00:19:30,547 --> 00:19:31,780
Irving Caesar wrote
the words.

335
00:19:31,847 --> 00:19:33,147
Caesar?

336
00:19:34,747 --> 00:19:36,680
Not so loud.
With all due respect.

337
00:19:36,747 --> 00:19:38,181
If business
gets better,

338
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:40,381
Maybe we can pay George's way to Europe.

339
00:19:40,448 --> 00:19:42,880
I wouldn't mention that
to your mother right now.

340
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:45,513
Oh, this one they'll print.
Just wait and see.

341
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,981
Oh, what a beautiful
manuscript.

342
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:48,513
Look, Poppa.

344
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:54,513
How neat you write it,
Georgie.

345
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,714
Such black ink.

346
00:19:58,081 --> 00:20:00,513
Such a fine,
ambitious boy.

347
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,513
And Ira, too.

349
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:13,914
And tell Max I've only got 10
more minutes, but I can stretch it.

350
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:15,613
I'll remind Mr. Dreyfus
that you're here.

351
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,880
That's what I meant.

352
00:20:16,947 --> 00:20:18,914
You're fresh.

353
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:21,114
Unfortunately,
you're not.

354
00:20:29,081 --> 00:20:32,014
How long have you known
Mr. Dreyfus? What's he like?

355
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:33,880
Never met him
in my life.

356
00:20:36,114 --> 00:20:37,513
Hmm.

357
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,714
But you just called him
by his first name.

358
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,214
It's better
than swearing.

359
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,714
In this town, if you don't call a man

360
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,214
By his first name, he
doesn't publish your music.

361
00:20:46,281 --> 00:20:48,214
They don't
publish mine anyway,

362
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:49,214
But it's still
a good theory.

363
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,214
Bum bum bump

364
00:20:51,281 --> 00:20:53,513
Hmm.
Diminished ninth.

365
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,513
If I had
your talent,

366
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,814
I'd be a pretty
obnoxious fella.

367
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,580
What do you
call yourself?

368
00:20:59,647 --> 00:21:01,814
George Gershwin.
It's my real name.

369
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,281
Mine's Oscar Levant.

370
00:21:03,348 --> 00:21:04,814
I'm thinking
of changing it.

371
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,513
Do you mind?

372
00:21:09,414 --> 00:21:11,014
Mr. Dreyfus
will see you now.

373
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:13,513
It's about time.
I knew he'd come my way.

374
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,513
Not you.
Mr. Gershwin.

375
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,014
Thanks for your
advice, Levant.

376
00:21:17,081 --> 00:21:19,181
Hey, George! Tell Max
I saw you first.

377
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:20,847
I will.

378
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,547
Are you still here?

379
00:21:24,613 --> 00:21:27,014
How would you like to
sponsor me through college?

380
00:21:27,081 --> 00:21:29,047
Fresh.

381
00:21:29,114 --> 00:21:31,880
You loathe me,
don't you?

382
00:21:41,613 --> 00:21:44,547
Mr. Dreyfus, sir, may I
please make a correction?

383
00:21:44,613 --> 00:21:47,014
It's more like this.
May I?

384
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:49,613
Da da da da,
da da da da

385
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,747
Oh.

386
00:21:51,814 --> 00:21:54,414
Da da da da,
da da da da, doo

387
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
Yeah, it has
bounce-

388
00:21:56,547 --> 00:21:58,513
A diminished
ninth, too.

389
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,047
Little unusual for
popular music, isn't it?

390
00:22:01,114 --> 00:22:03,014
Oh, I guess it is,
Mr. Dreyfus,

391
00:22:03,081 --> 00:22:06,381
But that's the way
I hear it in my mind.

392
00:22:06,448 --> 00:22:08,747
Oh, you hear it in your mind, do you?

393
00:22:08,814 --> 00:22:11,981
Yes, sir. We got to have
something different.

394
00:22:12,047 --> 00:22:13,513
Something
different, eh?

395
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,014
Huh. Have a cigar?

396
00:22:15,081 --> 00:22:16,981
No, thanks.
I don't smoke yet.

397
00:22:17,047 --> 00:22:18,647
It might hurt
my wind.

398
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:20,981
Huh? Oh, well, you don't
know what you're missing,

399
00:22:21,047 --> 00:22:23,014
Especially if you're
going to be a musician.

400
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:24,714
Now, watch.

401
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:28,513
There's your
whole note.

402
00:22:33,513 --> 00:22:35,081
Those are
half notes.

403
00:22:36,513 --> 00:22:38,981
Now, if you could learn
to do that, Mr. Gershwin,

404
00:22:39,047 --> 00:22:40,680
You could compose
without a pencil.

405
00:22:40,747 --> 00:22:42,181
You're making fun
of me.

406
00:22:42,247 --> 00:22:44,348
Oh, heaven forbid. I'm just
trying to get acquainted.

407
00:22:44,414 --> 00:22:46,114
Well-well, how do you
like my music?

408
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:47,747
Well, how do you
like it?

409
00:22:47,814 --> 00:22:49,047
Me?
Yes, you.

410
00:22:49,114 --> 00:22:51,014
But I wrote it.
Of course I like it!

411
00:22:51,081 --> 00:22:53,981
Don't say "of course." I've
written plenty I don't like at all.

412
00:22:54,047 --> 00:22:55,480
What about other music?

413
00:22:55,547 --> 00:22:57,448
Who tickles
your palate most?

414
00:22:57,513 --> 00:22:58,981
What kind of music?

415
00:22:59,047 --> 00:23:02,814
Oh, Bach, Mozart,
Beethoven, Tchaikovksy,

416
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,081
Berlin, Jerry Kern-

417
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:07,947
I like them all, Mr.
Dreyfus, especially Kern.

418
00:23:08,014 --> 00:23:09,448
Kern, eh?

419
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:13,014
You know, I think we're going to
get on very well, Mr. Gershwin.

420
00:23:13,081 --> 00:23:15,014
How would you like
a two-year contract-

421
00:23:15,081 --> 00:23:16,780
Say, at, uh,
$30 a week?

422
00:23:16,847 --> 00:23:18,981
Are you joking?

423
00:23:19,047 --> 00:23:21,513
Well, make it 35.

424
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,247
You mean you'd pay me
to write my own songs?

425
00:23:25,314 --> 00:23:27,247
Well, that's all it's-
Oh.

426
00:23:27,314 --> 00:23:29,448
Why not? Let's start
with this one.

427
00:23:29,513 --> 00:23:31,414
Play it for me,
young man.

428
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,647
Yes, sir.
I'd be glad to.

429
00:24:02,014 --> 00:24:03,981
Winter Garden-
Backstage.

430
00:24:12,747 --> 00:24:14,780
Hello.

431
00:24:19,348 --> 00:24:21,414
Say, wait a minute.
What is this?

432
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:24,647
Yeah, I know
it's Max Dreyfus,

433
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,680
But who is that guy
plunking the piano?

434
00:24:26,747 --> 00:24:27,947
Gershwin.

435
00:24:28,014 --> 00:24:30,714
Gershwin.
Never heard of him.

436
00:24:32,914 --> 00:24:34,814
Say...

437
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,814
That ain't
a bad ditty.

438
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,680
George.

439
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,947
Who wrote it?

440
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,513
Wait a minute.

441
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,513
Max, it's me-
Joley-talking.

442
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,047
Who wrote it?

443
00:24:48,114 --> 00:24:49,580
I did.

444
00:24:49,647 --> 00:24:51,081
Mr. Jolson!

445
00:24:51,147 --> 00:24:52,580
Thanks.

446
00:24:52,647 --> 00:24:56,181
You don't think it's too far
off the beaten path, do you, al?

447
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:58,181
Max, look, send that song
over to me,

448
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:01,381
And I guarantee I'll make them
beat a path to it a mile long.

449
00:25:01,448 --> 00:25:03,480
Thanks, Al.

450
00:25:03,547 --> 00:25:05,513
So long, kid.

451
00:25:29,281 --> 00:25:30,880
Ready, Mr. Jolson.

452
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,513
Why, Mr. Gershwin! Oh, I'm Julie
- Julie Adams.

453
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,780
Remember at Remick's
when you lost your job?

454
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:48,947
Oh, yes. I see you're
working at last.

455
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,247
In the chorus, but I'm
understudying a part.

456
00:25:51,314 --> 00:25:54,147
You'll get parts if I
have to write them for you.

457
00:25:56,047 --> 00:25:57,981
I knew
it was your song.

458
00:25:58,047 --> 00:25:59,314
Good luck.

459
00:25:59,381 --> 00:26:00,814
Thanks.

460
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,014
Well, George, you'll know in a minute.

461
00:26:10,914 --> 00:26:14,348
I been away from you
a long time

462
00:26:14,414 --> 00:26:18,014
I never thought
I'd miss you so

463
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:21,513
Somehow I feel
your love is real

464
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,613
Near you
I wanna be

465
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,480
The birds are singing,
it is songtime

466
00:26:28,547 --> 00:26:31,680
The banjo's strumming
soft and low

467
00:26:31,747 --> 00:26:35,513
I know that you yearn
for me, too

468
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,047
Swanee,
you're calling me

469
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:40,547
Swanee

470
00:26:40,613 --> 00:26:42,547
How I love you,
how I love you

471
00:26:42,613 --> 00:26:45,214
My dear old Swanee

472
00:26:45,281 --> 00:26:48,714
I'd give the world
to be

473
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:52,214
Among the folks
in D-I-X-I-E

474
00:26:52,281 --> 00:26:54,647
Even now
my mammy's

475
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:56,247
Waiting for me,
praying for me

476
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:59,314
Down by the Swanee

477
00:26:59,381 --> 00:27:02,981
The folks up north
won't see me no more

478
00:27:03,047 --> 00:27:07,281
When I get
to that Swanee shore

479
00:27:17,014 --> 00:27:19,181
I love
the old folks at home

480
00:27:19,247 --> 00:27:20,847
Uh-huh, huh

481
00:27:20,914 --> 00:27:22,181
Swanee

482
00:27:22,247 --> 00:27:24,181
How I love you,
how I love you

483
00:27:24,247 --> 00:27:26,914
My dear old Swanee

484
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:30,680
I'd give the world
to be

485
00:27:30,747 --> 00:27:34,214
Among the folks
in D-I-X-I-E

486
00:27:34,281 --> 00:27:36,381
Even now
my mammy's

487
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:38,214
Waiting for me,
praying for me

488
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,714
Down by the swanee

489
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,880
The folks up north
won't see me no more

490
00:27:44,947 --> 00:27:49,147
When I get
to that Swanee shore

491
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,448
You should be
happy, Rose.

492
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:04,081
I am happy.

493
00:28:05,847 --> 00:28:07,281
That was great, Al.

494
00:28:07,348 --> 00:28:09,281
Thanks. Listen, kid,
write more songs like that,

495
00:28:09,348 --> 00:28:11,480
And your name will be up
in electric lights.

496
00:28:11,547 --> 00:28:14,480
Thanks, Al. Now I'll do
some still better than that.

497
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:21,348
The folks up north
won't see me no more

498
00:28:21,414 --> 00:28:25,448
When I get
to that Swanee shore

499
00:28:25,513 --> 00:28:27,480
And on the other side

500
00:28:27,547 --> 00:28:29,314
There's another
Gershwin tune.

501
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,680
Hits. Hits. All I hear
from you lately is hits.

502
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,981
You are becoming just a
merchant, Mr. Gershwin.

503
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:39,580
The public
likes my stuff.

504
00:28:39,647 --> 00:28:43,747
Evidently. You have new
clothes, hand-painted cravat.

505
00:28:43,814 --> 00:28:47,014
But is your work the best?
As good as you can do?

506
00:28:47,081 --> 00:28:48,014
Of course not, yet.

507
00:28:48,081 --> 00:28:51,047
Or are you just
making a fortune?

508
00:28:51,114 --> 00:28:54,414
What's wrong with a fortune
if it helps me get on?

509
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,014
Come here, my boy.

510
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:58,780
Look.

511
00:28:58,847 --> 00:29:01,947
This is Franz Schubert.

512
00:29:02,014 --> 00:29:04,780
He was a songwriter, too.

513
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:09,880
He died young,
at 32.

514
00:29:09,947 --> 00:29:14,281
For years, he wore the
same old faded necktie.

515
00:29:14,348 --> 00:29:16,814
But in the land
that nurtured him,

516
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,014
He was a voice that
will never be silenced.

517
00:29:22,814 --> 00:29:24,847
Here, Richard Wagner.

518
00:29:24,914 --> 00:29:28,314
At rehearsals
of his great opera Rienzi,

519
00:29:28,381 --> 00:29:31,814
Richard Wagner
hid in the wings

520
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,348
While the singers
ate their luncheon.

521
00:29:35,448 --> 00:29:37,814
He didn't
have a lunch-

522
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,181
Just dreams of the music of the future.

523
00:29:43,247 --> 00:29:45,714
Beethoven.

524
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:53,014
He never asked himself,
"is this a hit?"

525
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:57,114
He said, "this is the
way it must be done."

526
00:29:57,181 --> 00:30:02,014
In time, I'll write
the way I feel.

527
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:05,014
But you see, with the
money I'm making now,

528
00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:07,981
I'll have my chance
to do the things I want-

529
00:30:08,047 --> 00:30:09,348
The things you want.

530
00:30:09,414 --> 00:30:12,547
And you couldn't
go to Europe now?

531
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,014
Right now...

532
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:20,014
Right now, I've got the
chance to write the music

533
00:30:20,081 --> 00:30:21,714
For an entire
new show,

534
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,181
From beginning
to end.

535
00:30:23,247 --> 00:30:25,047
And then what, George?

536
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,714
Back to your hits?

537
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,214
You can trust me,
professor Franck.

538
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:32,181
I know
what you mean.

539
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,547
Eh? You see that?

540
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:36,547
That wasn't a hit
at first.

541
00:30:36,613 --> 00:30:39,747
It is a manuscript
of Johannes Brahms.

542
00:30:39,814 --> 00:30:41,513
You knew him?

543
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,147
Yes. He gave it
to me in Vienna.

544
00:30:44,214 --> 00:30:46,880
Once, I hoped to reach his greatness,

545
00:30:46,947 --> 00:30:52,247
But one pupil like you makes up
for a lifetime of disappointments.

546
00:30:52,314 --> 00:30:55,513
Professor Franck...

547
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,780
You overestimate
my future.

548
00:30:57,847 --> 00:31:01,348
Oh, I have such hopes for you, my boy.

549
00:31:01,414 --> 00:31:03,513
America's
a growing country,

550
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,014
A mixture
of things very old

551
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:08,480
With more
that is new.

552
00:31:08,547 --> 00:31:11,181
Your nature has the
same contradictions-

553
00:31:11,247 --> 00:31:13,181
The lamb
and the wolf,

554
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:16,480
Ideals and material
ambition.

555
00:31:16,547 --> 00:31:19,814
If you can make them
both serve,

556
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,147
George, you can give America her voice.

557
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,114
Well, what are we
waiting for?

558
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:38,414
Who is bidding?

559
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,014
Such a hand. Morris,
what a dealer you are.

560
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:42,047
I trade you
even.

561
00:31:42,114 --> 00:31:43,547
Don't do me
any favors.

562
00:31:43,613 --> 00:31:46,348
You know, Morris,
it's very high-class.

563
00:31:46,414 --> 00:31:48,714
The furniture?
All Grand Rapids.

564
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,880
Business must be good
at a stationery store.

565
00:31:50,947 --> 00:31:52,780
It couldn't be worse,
Mr. Katzman.

566
00:31:52,847 --> 00:31:55,281
I'm thinking of getting
myself a Turkish bath.

567
00:31:55,348 --> 00:31:57,780
Oh, not for pleasure.
For business.

568
00:31:57,847 --> 00:31:59,947
Now there's
a gold mine for you.

569
00:32:00,014 --> 00:32:01,914
It couldn't be
George's music

570
00:32:01,981 --> 00:32:05,114
That pays for such a high-tone
apartment and all these nice things?

571
00:32:05,181 --> 00:32:06,348
And why not,
Mr. Million?

572
00:32:06,414 --> 00:32:08,181
His songs are selling
like hot corns,

573
00:32:08,247 --> 00:32:11,014
And always new ones
coming. Listen.

574
00:32:12,714 --> 00:32:16,314
You hear that? George is
in the act of composition.

575
00:32:16,381 --> 00:32:17,647
Composition?

576
00:32:17,714 --> 00:32:18,814
Sure.
Counterpoint.

577
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,914
Counterpoint.

578
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:20,914
Oh.

579
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:23,847
A song is being born.

580
00:32:23,914 --> 00:32:25,348
Excuse me.

581
00:32:37,613 --> 00:32:39,281
That help you,
Georgie?

582
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:40,547
Thanks, Pop.

583
00:32:40,613 --> 00:32:43,014
Don't mention it.
It's all in the family.

584
00:32:49,513 --> 00:32:52,480
Boys, that song is for
a new singer he found.

585
00:32:52,547 --> 00:32:53,780
Some tea, somebody?

586
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:54,847
No, thanks.

587
00:32:54,914 --> 00:32:55,981
Ah, such
a fine girl.

588
00:32:56,047 --> 00:32:56,981
Who is she?

589
00:32:57,047 --> 00:32:58,480
Her name is
Julie Adams.

590
00:32:58,547 --> 00:32:59,947
George is writing
the music for a show?

591
00:33:00,014 --> 00:33:01,081
Yeah. Musical show.

592
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:02,014
What's it called?

593
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:03,014
Half Past Eight.

594
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,147
Why Half
Past Eight?

595
00:33:05,214 --> 00:33:07,181
Because the curtain goes up
a quarter to 9:00.

597
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,647
S'wonderful

598
00:33:34,714 --> 00:33:36,880
S'marvelous

599
00:33:36,947 --> 00:33:40,580
You should care for me

600
00:33:40,647 --> 00:33:44,448
Oh, it's wonderful

601
00:33:44,513 --> 00:33:48,547
It's marvelous

602
00:33:48,613 --> 00:33:52,680
That you should care for me

603
00:33:52,747 --> 00:33:56,147
Only me

604
00:33:56,214 --> 00:34:03,214
Oh, wonderful

605
00:34:10,247 --> 00:34:12,114
You were swell,
Julie. Swell.

606
00:34:12,181 --> 00:34:14,181
If anything could
save us, you could.

607
00:34:14,247 --> 00:34:16,181
Do you really think
I'm improving, George?

608
00:34:16,247 --> 00:34:18,513
You were wonderful.

609
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,714
Music is all right, but the
show will never be a hit.

610
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,680
Through, ain't you?

611
00:34:32,747 --> 00:34:35,880
Through, bud? Ain't no
floor show here, you know.

612
00:34:38,214 --> 00:34:41,014
Not even a mention
of the music.

613
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:44,147
When they don't like a show, they
don't look for anything good in it.

614
00:34:44,214 --> 00:34:45,580
Why take it to heart?

615
00:34:45,647 --> 00:34:47,981
It's my nature to take things to heart.

616
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:51,181
Drink your coffee, George,
before it gets cold.

617
00:34:54,513 --> 00:34:57,981
After all, I was in the show,
and I don't take it personally.

618
00:34:58,047 --> 00:35:01,147
You were the only
good thing in the show.

619
00:35:01,214 --> 00:35:03,348
Do you mean that,
George?

620
00:35:03,414 --> 00:35:05,047
Of course I mean it.

621
00:35:06,914 --> 00:35:10,947
I guess I'd come a lot farther
than Hartford to hear you say that.

622
00:35:11,014 --> 00:35:12,348
Who am I?

623
00:35:12,414 --> 00:35:16,014
You taught me how
to put over a song.

624
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:18,513
You've given me
my first real part.

625
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,680
What if this show is a flop?
We'll do others.

626
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:24,014
I haven't got time
for flops.

627
00:35:30,747 --> 00:35:32,214
No time for flops.

628
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:35,547
George, what on earth are
you in such a rush about?

629
00:35:35,613 --> 00:35:38,348
I want to learn everything about music.

630
00:35:38,414 --> 00:35:40,847
I've got to have
time to study,

631
00:35:40,914 --> 00:35:41,981
And look at me.

632
00:35:42,047 --> 00:35:44,981
6 months wasted
on a flop.

633
00:35:45,047 --> 00:35:46,680
You poor kid.

634
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,348
Oh, no, I don't
mean it that way.

635
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:52,314
Not because you had a little
setback. That isn't important.

636
00:35:52,381 --> 00:35:54,880
But because you
drive yourself so hard.

637
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:58,348
George, are you going to do
that all the rest of your life?

638
00:35:58,414 --> 00:36:02,047
Until I prove
what I can do.

639
00:36:05,047 --> 00:36:07,114
What's the matter,
Julie?

640
00:36:07,181 --> 00:36:08,147
Nothing.

641
00:36:08,214 --> 00:36:09,814
Oh, yes, there is.

642
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,780
Well, I just get a little
frightened when you talk like that.

643
00:36:13,847 --> 00:36:16,147
I'm afraid you'll
burn yourself out.

644
00:36:16,214 --> 00:36:17,647
Don't worry
about me.

645
00:36:17,714 --> 00:36:20,480
See that? The longest
life line you ever saw.

647
00:36:35,247 --> 00:36:37,181
Mr. Gershwin, have
you got somebody

648
00:36:37,247 --> 00:36:39,181
Who can beat me
with a switch?

649
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:41,181
I'm sorry. We'll have
more help next week.

650
00:36:42,214 --> 00:36:43,547
Oh, excuse me.

651
00:36:43,613 --> 00:36:46,513
But my doctor told me for my
rheumatism, I got to perspire.

652
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,547
Next week.
And come early.

653
00:36:47,613 --> 00:36:49,680
Sweet, sweet,
sweetie

654
00:36:49,747 --> 00:36:52,780
Hello? Hello, Saul.

655
00:36:52,847 --> 00:36:54,613
No. Poppa gave up
the stationery store.

656
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,613
It's a Turkish bath now.

657
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,314
Oh, business is pretty good ever
since George brings his friends in.

658
00:37:02,381 --> 00:37:04,181
Yeah, ok.
I'll tell Pop.

659
00:37:04,247 --> 00:37:06,981
Hmm hmm hmm hmm

660
00:37:07,047 --> 00:37:08,480
Oh, hello, Ira.

661
00:37:08,547 --> 00:37:10,480
Hi, George. Mr. Dreyfus
and a friend of his

662
00:37:10,547 --> 00:37:11,914
Are in
the steam room.

663
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:13,547
They should be
about cooked.

664
00:37:13,613 --> 00:37:14,814
Say, what
are you doing?

665
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,281
Oh, just
sort of studying

666
00:37:16,348 --> 00:37:18,981
The way words and music fit together.

667
00:37:19,047 --> 00:37:20,580
You mean, you're
writing something.

668
00:37:20,647 --> 00:37:22,981
Oh, just some jingles. I'll tell
you if they're ever any good.

669
00:37:23,047 --> 00:37:25,981
You mean you
write lyrics!

670
00:37:26,047 --> 00:37:27,880
Why, Ira,
that's swell.

671
00:37:27,947 --> 00:37:30,147
That's what I'd like to do, sometime.

672
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:31,914
I'm awfully glad, Ira.

673
00:37:34,414 --> 00:37:36,147
Oh, Mr. Dreyfus? Hello.

674
00:37:36,214 --> 00:37:37,181
Where are you?

675
00:37:37,247 --> 00:37:39,181
Here, up
in cloud 9.

676
00:37:39,247 --> 00:37:40,181
I can't
see you.

677
00:37:40,247 --> 00:37:41,181
Here.

679
00:37:42,414 --> 00:37:43,714
George, meet George.

680
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,480
Hiya, George.
Hello, George.

681
00:37:45,547 --> 00:37:47,181
His last name is white.

682
00:37:47,247 --> 00:37:49,847
I like some of your songs.
That's what brought me here.

683
00:37:49,914 --> 00:37:52,247
Otherwise, I never
take a bath.

684
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:54,147
They're far from
my best stuff yet.

685
00:37:54,214 --> 00:37:56,114
You know, that's what I like
about Gershwin.

686
00:37:56,181 --> 00:37:57,513
He's so modest.

687
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,714
What was I
saying?

688
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,247
You were saying that you're
good and getting better.

689
00:38:02,314 --> 00:38:03,348
Well, I am.

690
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,114
Here's a chance to prove
how good you are.

691
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:06,747
Tell him, George.

692
00:38:06,814 --> 00:38:09,147
I'm doing a new show. I'm
going to call it The Scandals.

693
00:38:09,214 --> 00:38:11,147
I intend to do a new edition every year.

694
00:38:11,214 --> 00:38:12,680
He wants you
to do the music.

695
00:38:12,747 --> 00:38:15,814
Thanks, but... to be
perfectly frank, Mr. White,

696
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,613
Before I take the job, I want to
be sure the show's got a chance.

697
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,480
You see, I can't afford to
waste 6 months on another flop.

698
00:38:22,547 --> 00:38:23,480
I haven't the time.

699
00:38:23,547 --> 00:38:24,613
Time?

700
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,580
I mean, I've got to
get on with my career.

701
00:38:26,647 --> 00:38:30,247
He's almost 21, and he hasn't
played Carnegie Hall yet.

702
00:38:30,314 --> 00:38:32,647
This is going to be the
swellest show the town ever saw-

703
00:38:32,714 --> 00:38:35,714
The most gorgeous scenery and the
most beautiful girls ever born.

704
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,147
It'll have the best
of everything.

705
00:38:38,214 --> 00:38:40,181
You'll have a chance
to spread yourself,

706
00:38:40,247 --> 00:38:42,014
Top anything
you've ever done.

707
00:38:42,081 --> 00:38:44,047
George, here's
your opportunity.

708
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:45,981
The music's up to you.

709
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,914
Get your copies here!

710
00:38:50,981 --> 00:38:52,081
Here you are, folks.
Hit of the show.

711
00:38:52,147 --> 00:38:53,081
Somebody loves me,

712
00:38:53,147 --> 00:38:54,281
Sung by Julie Adams

713
00:38:54,348 --> 00:38:55,281
And Tom Patricola.

714
00:38:55,348 --> 00:38:56,981
Get your copies here, folks.

715
00:39:20,747 --> 00:39:23,348
Somebody loves me

716
00:39:23,414 --> 00:39:26,147
I wonder who

717
00:39:26,214 --> 00:39:29,814
I wonder who she can be

718
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,181
Somebody
loves me

719
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:37,147
I wish I knew

720
00:39:37,214 --> 00:39:39,014
Who can she be?

721
00:39:39,081 --> 00:39:41,147
Worries me

722
00:39:41,214 --> 00:39:43,847
For every girl
who passes me

723
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:44,981
I shout

724
00:39:45,914 --> 00:39:47,513
Maybe

725
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,680
Yeah, she
was meant to be

726
00:39:49,747 --> 00:39:53,314
Your lovin' baby

727
00:39:53,381 --> 00:39:56,047
Somebody loves me

728
00:39:56,114 --> 00:39:58,714
I wonder who

729
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,381
Maybe it's you

730
00:40:39,247 --> 00:40:41,580
Somebody loves me

731
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:44,247
I wonder who

732
00:40:44,314 --> 00:40:48,081
Maybe it's you

733
00:42:18,414 --> 00:42:22,014
41/2 minutes. A very
important piece.

734
00:42:26,814 --> 00:42:28,147
I don't care what
anybody thinks.

735
00:42:28,214 --> 00:42:29,247
I liked your songs,
George.

736
00:42:29,314 --> 00:42:30,780
Everybody liked them,
didn't they, buddy?

737
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:33,714
When they sell a million copies,
then I'll know they like them.

738
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,513
What if they
only sell 900,000?

739
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,547
You sound like a big executive,
De Sylva.

740
00:42:38,613 --> 00:42:39,647
Oh, Max.

741
00:42:39,714 --> 00:42:41,114
Excuse me.

742
00:42:41,181 --> 00:42:44,214
Max, I want to thank you. You
started the ball rolling for me.

743
00:42:44,281 --> 00:42:46,448
You've hit your stride,
my boy. Now stick to it.

744
00:42:46,513 --> 00:42:48,714
You can do a lot
for musical comedy.

745
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,981
And it can do
a lot for you, too.

746
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:05,147
I'll build a stairway
to paradise

747
00:43:05,214 --> 00:43:09,714
With a new step every day

748
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,880
I'm going to get there
at any price

749
00:43:12,947 --> 00:43:17,348
Stand aside,
I'm on my way

750
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:51,214
I'm just a lonesome
babe in the wood

751
00:43:51,281 --> 00:43:58,281
So, lady, be good to me

752
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,448
What a girl.

753
00:44:07,513 --> 00:44:10,147
Don't tell me that kiss is far
from your best work, Mr. Gershwin.

754
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:12,114
I've just had
a brand-new idea.

755
00:44:12,181 --> 00:44:14,014
A blues song
for next year...

756
00:44:19,714 --> 00:44:21,314
All right,
George. I'll tell them.

757
00:44:21,381 --> 00:44:22,847
Sure, I agree with you.

758
00:44:22,914 --> 00:44:25,714
Harlem. Dame
shoots a guy.

759
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,147
That's not
for The Scandals.

760
00:44:28,214 --> 00:44:29,981
All right. Good-bye.

761
00:44:30,047 --> 00:44:32,147
Well, boys, White says the number's out.

762
00:44:32,214 --> 00:44:34,047
But why?
It's dramatic.

763
00:44:34,114 --> 00:44:35,613
You don't go for that
stuff, do you, Paul?

764
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,314
You're still
in your right mind?

765
00:44:37,381 --> 00:44:40,847
I don't know. I may be kind of batty,
but this looks mighty good to me.

766
00:44:40,914 --> 00:44:42,814
Why, it's as blue
as blue Monday.

767
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,281
Hey, that's
a good title.

768
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,348
Not bad.
Blue Monday Blues.

769
00:44:46,414 --> 00:44:48,014
Let's go down on the stage
and run it through.

770
00:44:48,081 --> 00:44:49,281
I'm with you, boss.

771
00:44:49,348 --> 00:44:50,747
Let's hear it
with the orchestra.

772
00:45:20,714 --> 00:45:23,847
I must admit, although
I don't like Sunday

773
00:45:23,914 --> 00:45:28,381
I have a fit when
I go through blue Monday

774
00:45:28,448 --> 00:45:34,513
Monday's the one day
that my dice lose

775
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:38,381
They just refuse

776
00:45:38,448 --> 00:45:42,947
That's when my cares
are always bigger

777
00:45:43,014 --> 00:45:47,414
His cares
are always bigger

778
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:54,480
I've got those
blue Monday blues

779
00:45:57,181 --> 00:45:58,114
Good evening, Vi.

780
00:45:58,181 --> 00:45:59,580
Good evening, all.

781
00:45:59,647 --> 00:46:01,448
Hi, Vi. Hi, Vi.

782
00:46:01,513 --> 00:46:06,814
Has one of you
seen Joe, my Joe?

783
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,780
For I have a date
with him here

784
00:46:11,847 --> 00:46:16,147
It couldn't be
that I have missed him

785
00:46:16,214 --> 00:46:20,847
I am a little early
for him

786
00:46:20,914 --> 00:46:24,214
Maybe

787
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:30,047
Has one of you
seen Joe?

788
00:46:30,114 --> 00:46:34,647
My lovin' man

789
00:46:34,714 --> 00:46:39,714
My Joe

790
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,613
That's when a gal
will pull a trigger

791
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,714
A gal will
pull a trigger

792
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:08,780
I've got those
blue Monday blues

793
00:47:25,214 --> 00:47:31,181
I love but you,
my Joe, my Joe

794
00:47:31,247 --> 00:47:37,214
I don't want a thing, dear, but you

795
00:47:37,281 --> 00:47:42,014
But after all,
I'm only human

796
00:47:42,081 --> 00:47:47,880
And I'm a mighty
jealous woman

797
00:47:47,947 --> 00:47:51,047
Honey

798
00:47:51,114 --> 00:47:58,114
Still, just as long
as you're true

799
00:47:58,847 --> 00:48:03,780
I'll live
for no one

800
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:10,348
But you

801
00:48:38,381 --> 00:48:44,613
"Hurry home, Joe.
Mother has died. Sis."

802
00:48:48,613 --> 00:48:51,847
Gershwin must have
lost his mind.

803
00:48:51,914 --> 00:48:54,448
It's great
stuff, George.

804
00:48:54,513 --> 00:48:56,613
Don't worry
about it.

805
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,147
I'm gonna see
my mother

806
00:49:07,214 --> 00:49:12,448
Mother mine

807
00:49:12,547 --> 00:49:17,880
Lord, how I've
missed my mother

808
00:49:17,947 --> 00:49:23,480
Mother mine

809
00:49:23,547 --> 00:49:28,680
Maybe I'm a very
worthless fellow

810
00:49:28,747 --> 00:49:32,714
But my weary heart

811
00:49:32,715 --> 00:49:36,680
Will cease to pine

812
00:49:36,747 --> 00:49:41,886
When in her arms,

813
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:45,513
I'll whisper

814
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:51,249
I am home again,

815
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:55,147
Mother mine

816
00:50:02,714 --> 00:50:03,880
Mike, you can
let the boys know

817
00:50:03,947 --> 00:50:05,348
If there's any change
in the rehearsal call.

818
00:50:05,414 --> 00:50:06,680
Ok, Paul.
Good night.

819
00:50:06,747 --> 00:50:08,314
Good night, boys.

820
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:11,847
Why can't we at least wait until you
hear what the critics have to say?

821
00:50:11,914 --> 00:50:13,381
Gives me
the creeps.

822
00:50:13,448 --> 00:50:17,047
George, it's great, but it doesn't
belong in this kind of a show.

823
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:19,747
The blues are out.
That's final.

824
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,714
Oh, Professor Franck.

825
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:25,214
How did you like
the blues number?

826
00:50:25,281 --> 00:50:26,314
Well-

827
00:50:26,381 --> 00:50:28,680
I'm so anxious to hear
what you have to say.

828
00:50:28,747 --> 00:50:30,714
That one number
was worth more

829
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,214
Than all the rest of
the show put together.

830
00:50:33,281 --> 00:50:34,181
Good.

831
00:50:34,247 --> 00:50:35,348
It was crude, yes,

832
00:50:35,414 --> 00:50:37,880
But it was original
and honest.

833
00:50:37,947 --> 00:50:40,181
Well, if you liked it,
I'm satisfied.

834
00:50:40,247 --> 00:50:44,014
But the audience didn't
entirely understand it.

835
00:50:44,081 --> 00:50:45,547
Paul, I'm worried
about George.

836
00:50:45,613 --> 00:50:46,714
This'll hit him
pretty hard.

837
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,714
The number was
really wonderful.

838
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,381
All we've got to do is get
the public blues-conscious.

839
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:54,181
He's sold on the blues. He
won't give them up for anybody.

840
00:50:54,247 --> 00:50:55,780
He knows what
he wants, Paul.

841
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:56,847
He'll go on.

842
00:50:56,914 --> 00:50:59,714
We'll go on.
The blues will go on.

843
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:01,814
Oh, George? George?

844
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,647
Not you, crapehanger.
I mean the music man.

845
00:51:04,714 --> 00:51:06,314
Oh, paul, I want you
to meet my teacher.

846
00:51:06,381 --> 00:51:07,847
Professor Franck,
Paul Whiteman.

847
00:51:07,914 --> 00:51:09,814
You must be very proud
of your young pupil.

848
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,680
He's just crawling
with talent.

849
00:51:11,747 --> 00:51:13,348
Yeah. Ha! Crawling.

850
00:51:13,414 --> 00:51:14,847
Do you know what
I think I'll do?

851
00:51:14,914 --> 00:51:16,680
What, Paul? Go back
to the Palais Royal?

852
00:51:16,747 --> 00:51:20,947
No. I think I'm going to give a jazz
concert smack-dab in Aeolian Hall.

853
00:51:21,014 --> 00:51:22,780
I'm going to make
a lady out of jazz.

854
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:24,780
The Blue Monday Blues
in Aeolian Hall?

855
00:51:24,847 --> 00:51:28,880
Better than that. George, I want
you to write a serious concert piece

856
00:51:28,947 --> 00:51:30,780
Based on the blues.

857
00:51:30,847 --> 00:51:33,547
A serious piece
that's blue, too?

858
00:51:33,613 --> 00:51:37,147
Blue themes
and jazz rhythms?

859
00:51:37,214 --> 00:51:38,647
Of course.

860
00:51:38,714 --> 00:51:40,513
You'll lose your shirt, Whiteman.

861
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,214
Those highbrows will laugh
you right out of Aeolian Hall.

862
00:51:43,281 --> 00:51:44,714
A Rhapsody in Blue.

863
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,714
And you talk about not wasting
time. You're throwing it away.

864
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,547
Professor Franck, I'm giving a little
party for George and a few friends

865
00:51:50,613 --> 00:51:52,547
Tonight at a speakeasy.
Will you join us?

866
00:51:52,613 --> 00:51:54,047
A place where you
can get real beer.

867
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:55,314
Real beer?
Sure.

868
00:51:55,381 --> 00:51:57,613
You invite me
to break the law?

869
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,814
Sure.

870
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,814
Well, perhaps tonight,
we should celebrate.

871
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,814
Come.

872
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,348
We break the law.

873
00:52:04,414 --> 00:52:05,348
Practically broke.

874
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:07,314
Good night,
Paul.

875
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,348
Let's drink a toast
to Max Dreyfus, our host,

876
00:52:11,414 --> 00:52:15,081
Discoverer and friend of those
who compose our best musical shows.

877
00:52:15,147 --> 00:52:16,114
Here goes.

878
00:52:16,181 --> 00:52:17,513
It rhymes.

879
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:21,547
Ira, you're a poet. The poet
laureate of Tony's Spaghetti.

880
00:52:21,613 --> 00:52:23,181
Another genius
in the family.

881
00:52:23,247 --> 00:52:25,448
You Gershwins ought
to form a union.

882
00:52:25,513 --> 00:52:28,680
Ira's good. He's going to write
the lyrics for my next show.

883
00:52:28,747 --> 00:52:31,647
Next show? What
next show, George?

884
00:52:31,714 --> 00:52:35,547
I suppose, Professor Franck, you've
decided he's not to write any more shows.

885
00:52:35,613 --> 00:52:37,547
I do not decide
such things.

886
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:40,714
But that's what you want. You'd
like him to throw away his success

887
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:42,680
And starve in a
Greenwich Village garret.

888
00:52:42,747 --> 00:52:45,414
The rents are pretty
high down there.

889
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,680
A man has to do what he feels. You see-

890
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:49,281
George, the old men
have the floor.

891
00:52:49,348 --> 00:52:50,281
George-

892
00:52:50,348 --> 00:52:52,047
Stop buzzing in his ear, will you?

893
00:52:52,114 --> 00:52:55,114
George has started a career
you find only in storybooks.

894
00:52:55,181 --> 00:52:57,147
What have you to offer
in its place?

895
00:52:57,214 --> 00:52:58,814
Poverty? Privation?
Sacrifice?

896
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,647
And I suppose after 20 years,
if he should go to Europe,

897
00:53:01,714 --> 00:53:04,981
He might write a sonata
for harp and flute.

898
00:53:07,981 --> 00:53:10,181
Then this charge
is a fair one.

899
00:53:10,247 --> 00:53:11,780
What do you
want of me?

900
00:53:11,847 --> 00:53:13,181
I want you to talk
sense to him.

901
00:53:13,247 --> 00:53:14,680
You have
an influence.

902
00:53:14,747 --> 00:53:17,480
Yeah, but you have
a contract.

903
00:53:17,547 --> 00:53:20,981
George is an American. He
writes of America for America.

904
00:53:21,047 --> 00:53:22,480
That's the way
it should be.

905
00:53:22,547 --> 00:53:25,847
And do you think America
is one big business deal?

906
00:53:25,914 --> 00:53:29,480
Why shouldn't George
plant seeds for the future?

907
00:53:29,547 --> 00:53:32,480
He shouldn't cut down trees for lumber.

908
00:53:32,547 --> 00:53:35,014
Because this boy
has a gift,

909
00:53:35,081 --> 00:53:38,513
He could be a great
voice in his country.

910
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,214
He's from
the people.

911
00:53:40,281 --> 00:53:43,613
He will write American music, yes.

912
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,547
But great
American music,

913
00:53:45,613 --> 00:53:50,314
Not just little tunes that
jingle like coins in your pocket.

914
00:53:50,381 --> 00:53:53,947
Tell me, what would be wrong if
the boy should be a Victor Herbert?

915
00:53:54,014 --> 00:53:55,947
Nothing. It's wonderful
to be a Victor Herbert.

916
00:53:56,014 --> 00:53:57,181
Well, then...

917
00:53:57,247 --> 00:54:00,147
Ahh. But if you
have the talent

918
00:54:00,214 --> 00:54:02,747
To be a Schubert or a
Brahms or a Beethoven-

919
00:54:02,814 --> 00:54:04,947
Wherever I go, there's always a fight.

920
00:54:05,014 --> 00:54:05,981
I wonder why.

921
00:54:06,047 --> 00:54:08,114
Oh, you mustn't get excited, you two.

922
00:54:08,181 --> 00:54:10,981
This is something George will
have to decide for himself.

923
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:16,714
Julie, darling, if George listens
to the voice within himself,

924
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:19,314
I'm not afraid
for what will happen.

925
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,014
Hmm?

926
00:54:21,081 --> 00:54:23,414
You will excuse me,
please.

927
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:28,181
I am an old man, and
it is past my bedtime.

928
00:54:28,247 --> 00:54:29,181
Good night.

929
00:54:29,247 --> 00:54:30,680
Good night. Good night.

930
00:54:30,747 --> 00:54:32,414
Good night,
George.

931
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,414
Waiter?

932
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,381
Yes, sir?

933
00:54:34,448 --> 00:54:35,613
What's the rap?

934
00:54:41,214 --> 00:54:44,181
Mr. Dreyfus, how do you
spell your name,

935
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:46,880
With one "s" or two?

936
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:06,981
Why did I ever get
myself mixed up with this?

937
00:55:07,047 --> 00:55:09,181
There goes Walter Damrosch. Yeah.

938
00:55:10,414 --> 00:55:13,480
That's Rachmaninoff
getting out of the cab.

939
00:55:16,381 --> 00:55:18,181
There's
Jascha Heifetz.

940
00:55:18,247 --> 00:55:20,348
Hello, Jascha.

941
00:55:20,414 --> 00:55:22,348
He's a nice
fellow.

942
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,814
That's Otto Kahn.

943
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,814
Stop, Oscar. I don't
want to hear any more.

944
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,314
What are you
so nervous about?

945
00:55:31,381 --> 00:55:32,680
They're all
friends of mine.

946
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:33,847
Come on.

947
00:55:36,081 --> 00:55:37,513
Well, I'm next.

948
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:40,547
Not like The Scandals,
eh, George?

949
00:55:42,747 --> 00:55:44,680
Brr. Boys, what's the
temperature outside?

950
00:55:44,747 --> 00:55:46,181
Exactly zero.

951
00:55:46,247 --> 00:55:49,214
6 to an even that audience
is 10 degrees colder.

952
00:55:49,281 --> 00:55:50,747
I'm not
saying a word.

953
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,547
Well, George,
it's up to you.

954
00:55:53,613 --> 00:55:56,613
What are you
so nervous about?

955
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,981
You'd better be good.
This means a lot to me.

956
00:55:59,047 --> 00:56:00,613
Shall we go?

957
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,114
Come on, Oscar.
Let's go out front.

958
00:56:03,181 --> 00:56:05,613
Why don't you
wish me luck?

959
01:05:05,714 --> 01:05:08,348
14 minutes and 5...

960
01:05:08,414 --> 01:05:10,414
A very important piece.

961
01:05:58,448 --> 01:06:00,348
If only Professor Franck
had been there.

962
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:02,847
He tried to come, George.
He just wasn't up to it.

963
01:06:02,914 --> 01:06:04,847
What's taking Ira so
long with those reviews?

964
01:06:04,914 --> 01:06:06,014
He's slower than
a freight train.

965
01:06:06,081 --> 01:06:07,414
He is not.

966
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,348
What do you know
about Ira?

967
01:06:09,414 --> 01:06:12,181
Well, I think I know
him as well as you do.

968
01:06:12,247 --> 01:06:13,647
Nonsense.
I'm his brother.

969
01:06:13,714 --> 01:06:15,647
Nonsense.
I'm engaged to him.

970
01:06:15,714 --> 01:06:17,314
What?

971
01:06:17,381 --> 01:06:19,247
You seem to be the slow one, George.

972
01:06:19,314 --> 01:06:21,181
We're getting married
next month. Aren't we, Ira?

973
01:06:21,247 --> 01:06:22,814
Uh-huh. The reviews
are wonderful!

974
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,847
Yes. He never
told me a word.

975
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:26,847
What's this about you
and lee getting married?

976
01:06:26,914 --> 01:06:28,381
We're very fond
of each other.

977
01:06:28,448 --> 01:06:29,381
Powerful words,
brother.

978
01:06:29,448 --> 01:06:30,414
Listen to this.

979
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,381
It's a big step, Lee,
an enormous step.

980
01:06:32,448 --> 01:06:34,680
Don't get me wrong. I'm not
against it. It's just that-

981
01:06:34,747 --> 01:06:36,747
"The Rhapsody in Blue
is a very stimulating piece"...

982
01:06:36,814 --> 01:06:38,381
There's always been
the 4 of us-

983
01:06:38,448 --> 01:06:39,880
Poppa, Momma,
Ira, and me...

984
01:06:39,947 --> 01:06:42,214
"Daring harmony
and dynamic composition".

985
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:43,247
What's that?

986
01:06:43,314 --> 01:06:44,381
The Times,
they like it.

987
01:06:44,448 --> 01:06:46,348
"In fact, Mr. Gershwin
may be leading the way

988
01:06:46,414 --> 01:06:49,613
"To a new and significant form of musical
expression that is typically American,

989
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,613
Combining the elements
of jazz with-"

990
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:54,381
Mr. Gillman says, "shows
daring and ingenuity,

991
01:06:54,448 --> 01:06:56,513
The trail of
an adventurous spirit."

992
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:58,014
Listen to this!

993
01:06:58,081 --> 01:07:00,947
Damrosch wants you to write
a concerto for full orchestra!

994
01:07:01,014 --> 01:07:03,381
Walter Damrosch? Of
the New York Symphony?

995
01:07:03,448 --> 01:07:04,414
Mm-hmm.

996
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,081
George, don't let him
turn your head.

997
01:07:07,147 --> 01:07:08,580
A concerto?

998
01:07:08,647 --> 01:07:11,047
What do I know
about concertos?

999
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:13,513
You see, Max,
I'm not equipped.

1000
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:16,880
There's too much
I don't understand.

1001
01:07:16,947 --> 01:07:20,147
I'm going to pass up
The Scandals, Max.

1002
01:07:20,214 --> 01:07:22,914
Ira, please
see Julie home.

1003
01:07:22,981 --> 01:07:24,513
Sure, George.

1004
01:07:26,381 --> 01:07:28,747
I've got to see
Professor Franck

1005
01:07:28,814 --> 01:07:31,847
And tell him
I'm going abroad.

1006
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:34,880
I think it's wonderful,
you two, just wonderful.

1007
01:07:34,947 --> 01:07:36,348
Oh...

1008
01:07:36,414 --> 01:07:37,880
Thanks.

1009
01:07:37,947 --> 01:07:39,381
Ira?

1010
01:07:39,448 --> 01:07:40,880
Yes?

1011
01:07:40,947 --> 01:07:42,381
Promise me
something.

1012
01:07:42,448 --> 01:07:43,880
Hmm?

1013
01:07:43,947 --> 01:07:46,547
Don't you ever
be a genius.

1014
01:07:59,947 --> 01:08:01,613
Hello?

1015
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,880
Hello, Nielson.

1016
01:08:03,947 --> 01:08:05,880
Oh, Mr. Gershwin.

1017
01:08:07,114 --> 01:08:08,547
He won't answer.

1018
01:08:08,613 --> 01:08:10,513
Is he asleep?

1019
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:12,181
He's dead.

1020
01:08:14,947 --> 01:08:16,381
What did you say?

1021
01:08:16,448 --> 01:08:19,381
It happened
2 or 3 hours ago.

1022
01:08:19,448 --> 01:08:22,914
They sent
for the doctor...

1023
01:08:22,981 --> 01:08:24,914
And when he came...

1024
01:08:24,981 --> 01:08:26,780
It was too late.

1025
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:35,047
Wait...
one minute, please.

1026
01:08:49,947 --> 01:08:54,580
He told me to give you
this manuscript of Brahms'.

1027
01:08:56,747 --> 01:08:59,381
He said you would
like to have it.

1028
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:02,214
Thank you.

1029
01:09:02,281 --> 01:09:05,914
Oh, Mr. Gershwin, he was so fond of you.

1030
01:10:16,214 --> 01:10:17,714
Extraordinaire.

1031
01:10:24,647 --> 01:10:28,081
It's a fascinating song.

1032
01:10:28,147 --> 01:10:29,580
Who wrote it?

1033
01:10:29,647 --> 01:10:31,647
A countryman
of yours.

1034
01:10:31,714 --> 01:10:34,680
Just meant for two

1035
01:10:34,747 --> 01:10:37,448
From which I'll never roam

1036
01:10:37,513 --> 01:10:41,181
Who would? Would you?

1037
01:10:41,247 --> 01:10:43,814
And so,
all else above

1038
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:48,680
I'm waiting for
the man

1039
01:10:48,747 --> 01:10:55,747
I love

1040
01:10:59,448 --> 01:11:02,081
Bravo!
Bravo!

1041
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,381
Messieurs et mesdames,

1042
01:11:07,448 --> 01:11:10,414
Ce n'est pas moi qui merite
vos applaudissements.

1043
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:13,448
C'est le compositeur
qui est ici ce soir-

1044
01:11:13,513 --> 01:11:15,513
Monsieur George Gershwin.

1045
01:11:29,613 --> 01:11:31,513
Welcome to Paris,
Mr. Gershwin.

1046
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:33,947
And now,
in your honor...

1047
01:11:43,247 --> 01:11:45,680
Clap-a yo' hands

1048
01:11:45,747 --> 01:11:49,348
Slap-a yo' thighs

1049
01:11:51,081 --> 01:11:53,580
Fascinating rhythm,
you got me on the go

1050
01:11:53,647 --> 01:11:56,480
Fascinating rhythm,
I'm all a-quiver

1051
01:11:56,547 --> 01:11:58,747
Fascinating rhythm,
the neighbors wanna know

1052
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:02,314
Fascinating rhythm,
why I'm a-shiver

1053
01:12:02,381 --> 01:12:08,247
Oh, how I long to be
the gal I used to be

1054
01:12:08,314 --> 01:12:12,714
Fascinating rhythm

1055
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:14,047
Who did you say
it was?

1056
01:12:14,114 --> 01:12:16,348
You mean to say you've never
heard of George Gershwin?

1057
01:12:16,414 --> 01:12:18,047
Why, his music's all
the rage just now.

1058
01:12:18,114 --> 01:12:19,513
His songs, his Rhapsody,

1059
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:22,914
What we call the "hot jazz."

1060
01:12:22,981 --> 01:12:25,513
You're getting out of touch, Christine.

1061
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:28,847
I really must go back
to America sometime.

1062
01:12:28,914 --> 01:12:31,147
Why not ask Gershwin
to join us?

1063
01:12:31,214 --> 01:12:33,281
Wherever he goes,
America goes with him.

1064
01:12:33,348 --> 01:12:36,348
It'll save you an
expensive trip, darling.

1065
01:12:38,414 --> 01:12:39,981
Excuse me,
please.

1066
01:13:06,847 --> 01:13:08,047
Let me introduce
Mr. Gershwin.

1067
01:13:08,114 --> 01:13:09,147
How do you do?

1068
01:13:09,214 --> 01:13:10,181
Mrs. Gilbert.

1069
01:13:10,247 --> 01:13:11,914
How do you do?

1070
01:13:11,981 --> 01:13:13,247
Good evening.

1071
01:13:13,314 --> 01:13:15,680
Oh, I don't mind him

1072
01:13:15,747 --> 01:13:18,914
You'll never find him

1073
01:13:18,981 --> 01:13:22,247
Hanging around my door

1074
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:25,081
I've got rhythm

1075
01:13:25,147 --> 01:13:27,981
I've got music

1076
01:13:28,047 --> 01:13:29,981
I've got my man

1077
01:13:30,047 --> 01:13:37,047
Who could ask
for anything more?

1078
01:13:49,714 --> 01:13:52,448
How is it, Mr. Gerswhin,
that you are so young?

1079
01:13:52,513 --> 01:13:54,847
After the dozens of songs
that you have written

1080
01:13:54,914 --> 01:13:57,348
And your rhapsody, they
expect you to be at least 40,

1081
01:13:57,414 --> 01:13:59,348
With a mustache,
very respectable,

1082
01:13:59,414 --> 01:14:01,814
Surrounded
by a large retinue.

1083
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:05,181
Well, I'm afraid
I don't live up.

1084
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,414
Doolee doodlee doo

1085
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:18,647
There's no land
so grand as my land

1086
01:14:18,714 --> 01:14:22,448
From California
to Manhattan Isle

1087
01:14:22,513 --> 01:14:23,981
Like my music?

1088
01:14:24,047 --> 01:14:25,847
Very much, what
I've heard of it.

1089
01:14:25,914 --> 01:14:29,314
I wrote this in 1922. You
ought to know my later stuff.

1090
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:30,814
How is it you don't?

1091
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,314
Perhaps I've been
in Europe too long.

1092
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:34,314
Oh, is your husband
in Paris?

1093
01:14:34,381 --> 01:14:35,314
No.

1094
01:14:35,381 --> 01:14:36,314
Excuse me.

1095
01:14:36,381 --> 01:14:37,814
They called you
Mrs. Gilbert.

1096
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:41,814
I divorced Gilbert before
you wrote this tune-In 1921.

1097
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,314
You see, I'm slightly
older than you are.

1098
01:14:44,381 --> 01:14:45,680
That's ideal.

1099
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:48,047
I'll say "I love you"

1100
01:14:48,114 --> 01:14:52,047
Make me lose
those Yankee doodle blues

1101
01:14:52,114 --> 01:14:54,814
Um doo-doodle
Yankee doodle

1102
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:55,947
That melody...

1103
01:14:56,014 --> 01:14:57,448
You dance very well.

1104
01:14:57,513 --> 01:15:00,947
Let's dance again tomorrow
afternoon, if you're not busy.

1105
01:15:01,014 --> 01:15:03,348
I'm sorry. I'm going to
see a show-an opening.

1106
01:15:03,414 --> 01:15:05,847
Do they open in the
afternoon in this town?

1107
01:15:05,914 --> 01:15:07,314
Why, certainly.

1108
01:15:07,381 --> 01:15:08,847
Are you
going alone?

1109
01:15:08,914 --> 01:15:11,348
No. I'm going
with some friends.

1110
01:15:11,414 --> 01:15:12,847
Oh. Where is this show?

1111
01:15:12,914 --> 01:15:14,348
At the Club Chouette.

1112
01:15:14,414 --> 01:15:15,847
It isn't sold out,
I hope.

1113
01:15:15,914 --> 01:15:17,847
Oh, almost
nothing's sold.

1114
01:15:17,914 --> 01:15:19,348
I'll see you there.

1115
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:22,580
You won't be hard
to find in any crowd.

1116
01:15:29,381 --> 01:15:30,814
Madame de Breteuil.

1117
01:15:33,381 --> 01:15:35,314
Well, how do you do?

1118
01:15:35,381 --> 01:15:36,814
How are you?

1119
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,780
Is there a theater
around here somewhere?

1120
01:15:38,847 --> 01:15:39,814
Theater?

1121
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,314
No, Monsieur,
there's no theater.

1122
01:15:41,381 --> 01:15:42,814
There must
be some mistake.

1123
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:46,314
Christine-that is, Mrs.
Gilbert-said something about a show.

1124
01:15:46,381 --> 01:15:47,814
Show?

1125
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,814
Oh, an exhibit.

1126
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,314
There it is.

1127
01:15:51,381 --> 01:15:52,814
How silly of me.

1129
01:15:59,214 --> 01:16:01,914
Merci.

1131
01:16:05,348 --> 01:16:07,348
I think his portrait
of William G.

1132
01:16:07,414 --> 01:16:09,348
Is an excellent representation
of cubistic form.

1133
01:16:09,414 --> 01:16:10,714
Of course, it's
purely experimental.

1134
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:12,281
Oh, there she is.

1135
01:16:12,348 --> 01:16:15,814
Oui, Madame Gilbert, but
may I show you number 12?

1136
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,480
Uh, pardon.

1137
01:16:21,348 --> 01:16:23,014
William G.?

1138
01:16:30,513 --> 01:16:32,381
Christine, do I show
any progress?

1139
01:16:32,448 --> 01:16:33,880
Unquestionably.

1140
01:16:33,947 --> 01:16:35,513
I like
the portrait best.

1141
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:37,081
Poor old William.

1142
01:16:37,147 --> 01:16:39,680
You have caught
his sense of humor.

1143
01:16:42,847 --> 01:16:45,147
Yes. He was a most
agreeable model.

1144
01:16:45,214 --> 01:16:47,348
Carl, you know I-

1145
01:16:47,414 --> 01:16:49,381
Why, Mr. Gershwin,
you're here.

1146
01:16:49,448 --> 01:16:51,381
Christine, my dear,
where are your paintings,

1147
01:16:51,448 --> 01:16:52,880
Your beautiful
landscapes?

1148
01:16:52,947 --> 01:16:55,214
I saw them here
only last week.

1149
01:16:55,281 --> 01:16:57,847
In the back room
with their faces to the wall.

1150
01:16:57,914 --> 01:17:01,114
I should never have let Pierre
hang them. I'm not ready yet.

1151
01:17:01,181 --> 01:17:03,414
Imagine,
a modest American!

1153
01:17:04,981 --> 01:17:07,880
You didn't tell me
you were a painter.

1154
01:17:07,947 --> 01:17:09,613
You didn't ask me.

1155
01:17:13,947 --> 01:17:15,414
Monsieur Ravel,
Monsieur Gershwin.

1156
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:16,914
Ravel.

1157
01:17:16,981 --> 01:17:18,914
Won't you join us,
please?

1158
01:17:18,981 --> 01:17:20,381
Your Bolero.

1159
01:17:20,448 --> 01:17:23,680
Monsieur Ravel, how much
I'd like to study with you.

1160
01:17:23,747 --> 01:17:28,348
If you study with me, you will
only write second-rate Ravel

1161
01:17:28,414 --> 01:17:30,348
Instead of
first-rate Gershwin.

1162
01:17:30,414 --> 01:17:33,680
Pardon. There's so much I'd like
to say to this brilliant American.

1163
01:17:33,747 --> 01:17:35,147
Certainly.

1164
01:17:35,214 --> 01:17:38,814
You won't object if I just sit
quietly and watch the leaves?

1165
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,214
Certainly.

1166
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:43,381
Tell me, how did you get the
inspiration for your rhythm?

1167
01:18:38,414 --> 01:18:39,680
Thank you.

1168
01:18:39,747 --> 01:18:41,348
You're not peeved
about last night?

1169
01:18:41,414 --> 01:18:43,381
Honestly, I forgot
all about you.

1170
01:18:43,448 --> 01:18:45,381
I assure you, I didn't mind at all.

1171
01:18:45,448 --> 01:18:47,147
I wanted you
to meet Ravel.

1172
01:18:47,214 --> 01:18:49,880
More particularly, I
wanted Ravel to meet you.

1173
01:18:49,947 --> 01:18:51,880
You take me for some
kind of curiosity.

1174
01:18:51,947 --> 01:18:53,348
That's stimulating,
George.

1175
01:18:53,414 --> 01:18:56,081
Your interest in me is
the same, you know.

1176
01:18:56,147 --> 01:18:58,747
Whatever I do or say,
you think is exotic.

1177
01:18:58,814 --> 01:19:01,480
I've never thought
of myself as exotic.

1178
01:19:01,547 --> 01:19:04,348
Takes a long time
to know you, Christine.

1179
01:19:04,414 --> 01:19:06,381
We met two weeks ago.

1180
01:19:06,448 --> 01:19:08,847
I've learned a lot
since then,

1181
01:19:08,914 --> 01:19:10,348
But not about you.

1182
01:19:10,414 --> 01:19:11,880
Don't try, George.

1183
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:15,081
Let me help you
while I can.

1184
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,414
Thank you.

1185
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,914
Christine,
I've got to tell you,

1186
01:19:21,981 --> 01:19:24,880
When something's inside me,
it has to come out.

1187
01:19:24,947 --> 01:19:26,914
Not one word
about love.

1188
01:19:26,981 --> 01:19:29,348
We can talk about painting,
coffee, history, society,

1189
01:19:29,414 --> 01:19:31,847
Times Square, the Champs
Elysees, whatever you like,

1190
01:19:31,914 --> 01:19:33,348
But not love.

1191
01:19:33,414 --> 01:19:35,547
You don't feel
anything at all?

1192
01:19:35,613 --> 01:19:40,214
I'm not worried yet
about what I feel.

1193
01:19:40,281 --> 01:19:42,181
It's you who must learn
to keep your feelings,

1194
01:19:42,247 --> 01:19:44,181
As you loosely call them, in control.

1195
01:19:44,247 --> 01:19:45,647
It's harder

1196
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:48,348
Than learning orchestration, George...

1197
01:19:48,414 --> 01:19:50,381
And far more
important.

1198
01:19:50,448 --> 01:19:53,247
I've tried to think
about my concerto.

1199
01:19:53,314 --> 01:19:55,381
I've been meaning
to take lessons

1200
01:19:55,448 --> 01:19:57,880
In composition and theory
and orchestration,

1201
01:19:57,947 --> 01:20:00,880
But what happens? You got
me in touch with Ravel.

1202
01:20:00,947 --> 01:20:03,348
He introduced me to
Honegger and Milhaud.

1203
01:20:03,414 --> 01:20:04,880
They like
to hear my songs,

1204
01:20:04,947 --> 01:20:06,348
And if I talk
about studying,

1205
01:20:06,414 --> 01:20:08,381
They smile and flatter me.

1206
01:20:08,448 --> 01:20:10,081
There's still
Stravinsky.

1207
01:20:15,448 --> 01:20:16,880
Come in.

1208
01:20:16,947 --> 01:20:18,880
Good morning,
George.

1209
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:20,381
Good morning.
What's this?

1210
01:20:20,448 --> 01:20:21,914
For you.

1211
01:20:21,981 --> 01:20:23,381
For me?

1212
01:20:23,448 --> 01:20:24,914
His name's Tinker.

1213
01:20:24,981 --> 01:20:26,613
Tinker, eh?

1214
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:31,348
Hello, Tinker. You're
a handsome little bloke.

1215
01:20:31,414 --> 01:20:33,847
Oh, I wouldn't do
that to you, fellow.

1216
01:20:33,914 --> 01:20:36,381
It was selfish of me to stick
to my painting last night.

1217
01:20:36,448 --> 01:20:37,847
I'm beginning
to understand

1218
01:20:37,914 --> 01:20:40,247
That painting for you
is like music for me.

1219
01:20:40,314 --> 01:20:45,547
If that were true, I'd be the
happiest woman in the world.

1220
01:20:48,914 --> 01:20:50,814
I know the real thing
when I see it,

1221
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,847
But I can't put it
on canvas.

1222
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:54,547
Maybe that's because
you're too critical.

1223
01:20:54,613 --> 01:20:56,214
Why don't you
let yourself go?

1224
01:20:56,281 --> 01:20:59,381
That, too, is easier
for you than for me.

1225
01:20:59,448 --> 01:21:01,880
I think you're doing
yourself an injustice.

1226
01:21:01,947 --> 01:21:03,381
Uh...

1227
01:21:03,448 --> 01:21:04,580
Oh.

1228
01:21:05,914 --> 01:21:08,214
I don't know much
about painting-not yet.

1229
01:21:08,281 --> 01:21:09,480
Who told you
what to buy?

1230
01:21:09,547 --> 01:21:11,381
I just took what
hit me right.

1231
01:21:11,448 --> 01:21:13,414
Do you want to see
the rest of them?

1232
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:14,947
Yes, I'd like to.

1233
01:21:15,014 --> 01:21:16,381
They were sent up

1234
01:21:16,448 --> 01:21:18,381
While I was at the theater last night.

1235
01:21:18,448 --> 01:21:19,880
When I get back home,

1236
01:21:19,947 --> 01:21:22,381
I'll hang a few of them on
the walls and study them.

1237
01:21:22,448 --> 01:21:24,880
I might even take a crack
at painting some myself.

1238
01:21:24,947 --> 01:21:26,847
Do you think
it would relax me

1239
01:21:26,914 --> 01:21:28,814
When my stomach nerves
get wound up too tight?

1240
01:21:30,414 --> 01:21:31,814
The night
I met you,

1241
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,281
They told me you were
America personified.

1242
01:21:34,348 --> 01:21:35,814
Well, I suppose I am.

1243
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,747
Over here, I feel more American
than I do when I'm at home.

1244
01:21:38,814 --> 01:21:41,014
You think that whatever
you want to do, you can.

1245
01:21:41,081 --> 01:21:43,513
You just take everything for granted.

1246
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:46,814
If you have time to look
at paintings in Paris,

1247
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,348
You take along a few
samples, just like that-

1248
01:21:49,414 --> 01:21:51,513
Whatever
hits you right.

1249
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:53,147
That's the American way.

1250
01:21:53,214 --> 01:21:55,147
But, Christine,
you're American, too.

1251
01:21:55,214 --> 01:21:56,647
Why not come back?

1252
01:21:56,714 --> 01:21:59,348
Maybe that's what's
wrong with your work-

1253
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:00,814
You've been away
too long.

1254
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:02,613
Let me show you
New York

1255
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,448
The way
you showed me Paris.

1256
01:22:04,513 --> 01:22:08,580
Chris, you'll come
to New York?

1257
01:22:11,448 --> 01:22:14,580
Would serve you
right if I did.

1258
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:18,114
I lost all my money
on the Dempsey-Tunney fight.

1259
01:22:18,181 --> 01:22:20,381
Liquor and parties are
my only escape these days.

1260
01:22:20,448 --> 01:22:21,381
From what?

1261
01:22:21,448 --> 01:22:22,348
Myself.

1262
01:22:22,414 --> 01:22:23,847
Try roller-skating.

1263
01:22:23,914 --> 01:22:25,314
Oh, Max.

1264
01:22:25,381 --> 01:22:27,847
Ed, you're slipping. You'd
better have another drink.

1265
01:22:27,914 --> 01:22:29,314
It's almost time now.
I can hardly wait!

1266
01:22:29,381 --> 01:22:30,814
Don't think I'm calm.

1267
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,814
Neither is Ira.
He's lost all restraint.

1268
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,847
He's been rhyming whiskey
with gin all night.

1269
01:22:34,914 --> 01:22:37,314
Take it easy, Ira. You're
under contract with me now.

1270
01:22:37,381 --> 01:22:39,348
Let's take a peek
out of the window.

1271
01:22:39,414 --> 01:22:40,847
Why aren't you
glowing, Oscar?

1272
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:43,314
I refuse to glow for any prodigal
who makes 300 grand a year.

1273
01:22:43,381 --> 01:22:44,847
Why don't you
play something?

1274
01:22:44,914 --> 01:22:46,314
I haven't
eaten anything.

1275
01:22:46,381 --> 01:22:47,847
Come on, Oscar,
play something.

1276
01:22:47,914 --> 01:22:49,547
What would you
like to hear?

1277
01:22:49,613 --> 01:22:51,647
How about
Somebody Loves Me?

1278
01:22:55,747 --> 01:22:58,880
There's a taxi.
It's George!

1279
01:22:58,947 --> 01:23:00,513
Get ready, everybody!

1280
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:02,214
George is coming.

1281
01:23:02,281 --> 01:23:03,847
Hurry, Oscar,
he's coming.

1282
01:23:03,914 --> 01:23:05,847
I may as well sit here
while I can.

1283
01:23:05,914 --> 01:23:07,314
George will soon
take over.

1284
01:23:07,381 --> 01:23:10,081
Shh. Keep quiet. I'm going
to put out the lights.

1285
01:23:10,147 --> 01:23:12,214
Shh!

1286
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,880
George!
Welcome home!

1287
01:23:19,947 --> 01:23:21,348
Julie!

1288
01:23:21,414 --> 01:23:24,847
Max, you old scoundrel,
you hatched all this up.

1289
01:23:24,914 --> 01:23:27,680
Ira, Lee, I want you all
to meet Christine Gilbert.

1290
01:23:27,747 --> 01:23:29,747
Good evening.

1291
01:23:29,814 --> 01:23:31,281
How do you do?

1292
01:23:31,348 --> 01:23:33,014
Good evening.

1293
01:23:34,981 --> 01:23:39,314
Uh... Mrs. Gilbert has
been in Europe for years.

1294
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:40,814
Yes,
of course.

1295
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,847
George insisted
that I come.

1296
01:23:42,914 --> 01:23:45,247
He didn't expect
such a large party.

1297
01:23:45,314 --> 01:23:46,480
Come in,
Mrs. Gilbert.

1298
01:23:46,547 --> 01:23:47,547
Thank you.

1299
01:23:47,613 --> 01:23:49,348
Any friend of George
is most welcome here.

1300
01:23:49,414 --> 01:23:50,348
Surprised, George?

1301
01:23:50,414 --> 01:23:52,181
I? Ira,
why didn't you tell me?

1302
01:23:52,247 --> 01:23:53,314
They threatened me.

1303
01:23:56,414 --> 01:23:57,847
The Gershwin
trademark!

1304
01:23:59,014 --> 01:24:01,414
I see you've learned
to play with both hands.

1305
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:03,381
I took the liberty of
recording our Rhapsody.

1306
01:24:03,448 --> 01:24:07,348
Yeah, I heard it, and I
still like my recording.

1307
01:24:07,414 --> 01:24:08,847
Tell me something,
George.

1308
01:24:08,914 --> 01:24:11,847
Good evening, Mrs.
Gilbert. My name's Levant.

1309
01:24:11,914 --> 01:24:14,348
Tell me something. If you
had it to do all over again,

1310
01:24:14,414 --> 01:24:16,647
Would you still fall
in love with yourself?

1311
01:25:00,947 --> 01:25:01,880
Wonderful!

1312
01:25:01,947 --> 01:25:02,947
Play do, do, do.

1313
01:25:03,014 --> 01:25:04,314
No. Fascinating Rhythm.

1314
01:25:04,381 --> 01:25:05,314
Clap yo' Hands.

1315
01:25:05,381 --> 01:25:06,947
Lady Be Good.

1316
01:25:07,014 --> 01:25:08,348
Oscar, do it again.

1317
01:25:08,414 --> 01:25:11,381
I can't do it again.
I haven't eaten.

1318
01:25:11,448 --> 01:25:13,381
Bidin' My Time,
George.

1319
01:25:13,448 --> 01:25:14,780
Yeah. Bidin' My Time.

1320
01:25:14,847 --> 01:25:21,847
I'm bidin' my time
'cause that's the kind...

1321
01:25:22,914 --> 01:25:24,880
Well, an evening with
Gershwin is a Gershwin evening.

1322
01:25:24,947 --> 01:25:27,314
Whenever he sees a piano,
he'll leave any girl flat.

1323
01:25:27,381 --> 01:25:28,580
You mustn't
take offense.

1324
01:25:28,647 --> 01:25:30,814
I keep busy...

1325
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,714
On the contrary...
I quite understand.

1326
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:36,314
You see, George is
never quite so happy

1327
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:38,914
As when he's playing his
own music for his friends.

1328
01:25:38,981 --> 01:25:41,314
Yes, I know.

1329
01:25:41,381 --> 01:25:42,847
How about a drink?

1330
01:25:42,914 --> 01:25:44,814
Thank you.

1331
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,947
Tell me, how did
George do in Paris?

1332
01:25:47,014 --> 01:25:48,647
Did he learn a lot
there?

1333
01:25:48,714 --> 01:25:50,147
Yes, I think
he did.

1334
01:25:50,214 --> 01:25:51,647
Did he finish
his concerto?

1335
01:25:51,714 --> 01:25:53,314
That's what
he went there for.

1336
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:54,480
Concerto? Concerto?

1337
01:25:54,547 --> 01:25:56,448
George is going to
do another musical.

1338
01:25:56,513 --> 01:25:58,613
Are you in show business,
too, Mr. Dreyfus?

1339
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,580
You have been in Europe a long time,

1340
01:26:00,647 --> 01:26:01,714
Haven't you,
Mrs. Gilbert?

1341
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:03,247
The rents
are cheaper there.

1342
01:26:03,314 --> 01:26:04,747
Have a drink?
Please.

1343
01:26:04,814 --> 01:26:06,247
Ice?
No. Just water.

1344
01:26:06,314 --> 01:26:08,513
I've been trying to protect
George from highbrows-

1345
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,847
That is to say, from
symphonies and concertos.

1346
01:26:10,914 --> 01:26:12,513
George will go
his own way.

1347
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:14,847
After all, there's no
reason why he shouldn't write

1348
01:26:14,914 --> 01:26:17,014
Popular songs one day
and symphonies the next.

1349
01:26:17,081 --> 01:26:18,181
Those long
compositions

1350
01:26:18,247 --> 01:26:19,880
Take up a lot of valuable time.

1351
01:26:19,947 --> 01:26:21,880
You don't drink,
do you?

1352
01:26:21,947 --> 01:26:23,014
Thank you.

1353
01:26:23,081 --> 01:26:24,981
Time seems to be
scarce over here.

1354
01:26:25,047 --> 01:26:26,513
Not mine.

1355
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:29,714
Mr. Levant, you're not
so ferocious as you sound.

1356
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:31,381
Don't let that
get around.

1357
01:26:31,448 --> 01:26:34,014
You know, George has
often spoken about you.

1358
01:26:34,081 --> 01:26:35,714
I understand
you compose, too.

1359
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:37,214
If it wasn't
for Gershwin,

1360
01:26:37,281 --> 01:26:39,914
I could have been a pretty
good mediocre composer.

1361
01:26:41,181 --> 01:26:43,613
But, Julie, don't
let it upset you.

1362
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:46,081
I'm sure it doesn't
mean a thing.

1363
01:26:46,147 --> 01:26:48,914
Just one of those shipboard roman...
acquaintances.

1364
01:26:48,981 --> 01:26:50,414
I begin
to understand now

1365
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,181
Why George
didn't write to me.

1366
01:26:52,247 --> 01:26:54,547
All the work on his concerto over there.

1367
01:26:54,613 --> 01:26:56,047
Concerto?
Fiddlesticks.

1368
01:26:56,114 --> 01:26:57,348
You haven't heard
the news.

1369
01:26:57,414 --> 01:27:00,047
He's writing a new show, for you, Julie.

1370
01:27:00,114 --> 01:27:03,780
Ira is doing the lyrics.
What a combination.

1371
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,914
Play Embraceable You.

1372
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,414
Let's get Julie
to sing it.

1373
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:14,914
Where is she?

1374
01:27:14,981 --> 01:27:16,513
Julie!

1375
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:20,247
Max, my head is splitting.
Please get me out of here.

1376
01:27:20,314 --> 01:27:22,247
But I can't leave
my guests.

1377
01:27:22,314 --> 01:27:24,247
Come now,
keep your chin up.

1378
01:27:24,314 --> 01:27:25,714
Go through
with this, Julie.

1379
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:26,880
Julie.

1380
01:27:26,947 --> 01:27:28,513
Julie, where have you
been? We've missed you.

1381
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:29,981
Everybody has been asking for you.

1382
01:27:30,047 --> 01:27:32,014
You must sing for us
now. But, George, I can't.

1383
01:27:32,081 --> 01:27:33,281
I've just been
telling Julie

1384
01:27:33,348 --> 01:27:34,480
About
the new show.

1385
01:27:34,547 --> 01:27:37,047
Ira is going to write
the lyrics. Mr. Words.

1386
01:27:37,114 --> 01:27:38,547
Mr. Music.

1387
01:27:38,613 --> 01:27:41,047
Julie, we'll make this the
best part you've ever had.

1388
01:27:41,114 --> 01:27:43,047
Just like old times,
only better.

1389
01:27:43,114 --> 01:27:44,414
We'll all be
together again.

1390
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,047
Now, how about
Embraceable You?

1391
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:51,181
Can you lend me
cab fare to go home?

1392
01:28:00,613 --> 01:28:03,414
Embrace me

1393
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:09,448
My sweet
embraceable you

1394
01:28:09,513 --> 01:28:11,448
Embrace me

1395
01:28:11,513 --> 01:28:16,513
You irreplaceable you

1396
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:19,281
Just one look at you

1397
01:28:19,348 --> 01:28:23,747
My heart
grew tipsy in me

1398
01:28:23,814 --> 01:28:25,914
You and you alone...

1399
01:28:25,981 --> 01:28:28,348
What a wonderful
welcome for George.

1400
01:28:28,414 --> 01:28:29,814
Mr. Host,
the season

1401
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:31,348
Has now officially started.

1402
01:28:31,414 --> 01:28:33,081
Thank you, Mr. Words.

1403
01:28:33,147 --> 01:28:38,547
I love all
the many charms

1404
01:28:38,613 --> 01:28:40,981
About you

1405
01:28:41,047 --> 01:28:42,880
Above all...

1406
01:28:42,947 --> 01:28:44,381
Nice.

1407
01:28:44,448 --> 01:28:46,247
It's exciting
to have George back.

1408
01:28:46,314 --> 01:28:53,314
I want
my arms about you

1409
01:28:54,014 --> 01:28:59,147
Don't be
a naughty baby

1410
01:28:59,214 --> 01:29:01,081
Come to Mama

1411
01:29:01,147 --> 01:29:08,147
Come to Mama, do

1412
01:29:10,214 --> 01:29:12,281
My... sweet...

1413
01:29:20,147 --> 01:29:21,780
Pardon me.

1414
01:29:38,647 --> 01:29:40,513
Christine.
Do you like it?

1415
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:43,047
So much that
it makes me furious.

1416
01:29:43,114 --> 01:29:47,014
You could do much better, dear,
if you'd only get started again.

1417
01:29:47,081 --> 01:29:49,014
Go on with
your work, George.

1418
01:29:49,081 --> 01:29:51,081
I'll browse around
the other masters.

1419
01:29:51,147 --> 01:29:52,780
Please do.

1420
01:29:55,414 --> 01:29:59,348
I, uh, I feel sort of guilty, Christine.

1421
01:29:59,414 --> 01:30:01,714
You don't paint
anymore.

1422
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:04,214
You're not happy
in New York.

1423
01:30:04,281 --> 01:30:05,381
You're happy.

1424
01:30:05,448 --> 01:30:07,114
When you're around,
I am.

1425
01:30:07,181 --> 01:30:10,680
No. You don't need
anyone or anything.

1426
01:30:10,747 --> 01:30:13,613
Whatever you touch
turns to gold.

1427
01:30:15,513 --> 01:30:17,147
You're busy every hour.

1428
01:30:17,214 --> 01:30:21,281
You have hundreds of friends
who like what you like.

1429
01:30:21,348 --> 01:30:25,114
I'm not good for you,
George.

1430
01:30:25,181 --> 01:30:27,814
You would be if you'd
only make up your mind.

1431
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:29,680
Then I'd be sure
of you.

1432
01:30:29,747 --> 01:30:31,814
Let's not put it off
any longer, darling.

1433
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:35,348
George, you're
the perfect bachelor.

1434
01:30:35,414 --> 01:30:37,047
It wouldn't do.

1435
01:30:38,181 --> 01:30:40,513
Don't you love me
enough?

1436
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:43,214
Maybe I love you
too much.

1437
01:30:50,914 --> 01:30:53,513
That's just what
I didn't want to happen.

1438
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:55,914
I want you
to marry me.

1439
01:30:58,214 --> 01:31:00,114
It'll never work, George.

1440
01:31:00,181 --> 01:31:03,114
We both want too much
out of life.

1441
01:31:03,181 --> 01:31:05,147
We'll have
what we want.

1442
01:31:05,214 --> 01:31:07,114
Tomorrow we'll
get a license

1443
01:31:07,181 --> 01:31:09,147
And look
for a place.

1444
01:31:09,214 --> 01:31:11,114
How about
a penthouse?

1445
01:31:11,181 --> 01:31:13,647
A penthouse
built for two.

1446
01:31:13,714 --> 01:31:16,147
You sound like
your songs, George,

1447
01:31:16,214 --> 01:31:19,647
And you expect life
to be like your music,

1448
01:31:19,714 --> 01:31:21,147
But it isn't.

1449
01:31:21,214 --> 01:31:26,047
You can make up songs,
but you can't make up life.

1450
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,314
Please go on
with your painting.

1451
01:31:33,381 --> 01:31:34,847
All right.

1452
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:40,348
You must
finish it soon.

1453
01:31:40,414 --> 01:31:42,381
You'll wait?

1454
01:31:43,747 --> 01:31:46,747
You've made such a fine start, George.

1455
01:31:46,814 --> 01:31:49,114
You mustn't
waste a minute.

1456
01:31:54,414 --> 01:31:58,314
The light won't hold... much longer.

1457
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:05,880
Chris-

1458
01:32:09,647 --> 01:32:11,647
Chris-

1459
01:32:11,714 --> 01:32:13,381
Chris!

1460
01:32:45,014 --> 01:32:48,814
George, why did you
come here?

1461
01:32:54,914 --> 01:32:56,847
What's happened,
George?

1462
01:32:56,914 --> 01:32:59,547
I had to see you, Julie.

1463
01:33:02,547 --> 01:33:04,947
You haven't felt the
need for quite a while.

1464
01:33:05,014 --> 01:33:07,014
But, Julie
- It's all right, George.

1465
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:09,547
I knew I shouldn't have taken this show.

1466
01:33:09,613 --> 01:33:12,047
To have me around would just bother you.

1467
01:33:12,114 --> 01:33:14,547
You know how I've always
felt about you, Julie.

1468
01:33:14,613 --> 01:33:16,647
I have to talk to someone.

1469
01:33:16,714 --> 01:33:20,880
Could it be that Mrs.
Gilbert isn't available?

1470
01:33:20,947 --> 01:33:23,081
She's gone...

1471
01:33:24,914 --> 01:33:27,381
To Mexico.

1472
01:33:27,448 --> 01:33:29,014
Read it, Julie.

1473
01:33:36,281 --> 01:33:38,147
You have the wrong idea
about me, George.

1474
01:33:38,214 --> 01:33:40,847
You think I can be
put away in lavender

1475
01:33:40,914 --> 01:33:43,214
And then be taken out
as a last resort.

1476
01:33:43,281 --> 01:33:45,348
I don't want
to read your letters.

1477
01:33:45,414 --> 01:33:47,480
I don't want you
to cry on my shoulder.

1478
01:33:47,547 --> 01:33:51,114
I don't want
anything at all.

1479
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:00,348
I've been all
mixed up, Julie.

1480
01:34:00,414 --> 01:34:01,947
Please try
to understand.

1481
01:34:02,014 --> 01:34:03,647
I do understand...

1482
01:34:03,714 --> 01:34:05,348
Too well.

1483
01:34:05,414 --> 01:34:08,348
Everything I say
is wrong.

1484
01:34:08,414 --> 01:34:10,047
Please go.

1485
01:34:18,448 --> 01:34:19,847
Ready, Julie?

1486
01:34:19,914 --> 01:34:21,547
Come in, Max.

1487
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:31,348
What's wrong?

1488
01:34:37,714 --> 01:34:43,348
"George, dear, by the time this reaches
you, I'll be on my way to Mexico."

1489
01:34:44,714 --> 01:34:47,647
"Perhaps I can get back
to work down there.

1490
01:34:47,714 --> 01:34:49,513
"Anyhow, I must try.

1491
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:53,847
"Your destiny moves straight
ahead in fast 2-4 time.

1492
01:34:53,914 --> 01:34:57,181
"Mine simply goes
around in a circle.

1493
01:34:57,247 --> 01:35:01,081
"I meant it when I said
you were the ideal bachelor.

1494
01:35:01,147 --> 01:35:03,081
"You think
of yourself first,

1495
01:35:03,147 --> 01:35:05,613
"And that's
as it should be

1496
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:08,847
"Because you give so much
pleasure to the world.

1497
01:35:08,914 --> 01:35:13,348
"I was tempted for a while
to spoil it all for you.

1498
01:35:13,414 --> 01:35:15,147
"Now I know better.

1499
01:35:15,214 --> 01:35:17,314
Christine."

1500
01:35:24,081 --> 01:35:26,547
I've done her
a great injustice.

1501
01:35:26,613 --> 01:35:28,448
The woman has good sense-

1502
01:35:28,513 --> 01:35:30,847
I mean, as far
as she is concerned.

1503
01:35:30,914 --> 01:35:33,613
Don't spare
my feelings, Max.

1504
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:37,981
I know she's right, as
far as anyone is concerned.

1505
01:35:38,047 --> 01:35:41,281
George has to go
his way alone.

1506
01:35:41,348 --> 01:35:43,014
He must be free.

1507
01:35:43,081 --> 01:35:46,348
Yes, but, Julie, with you,
it would be different.

1508
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:52,814
No, Max. I'll never
be a handicap.

1509
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,348
The day
this show closes,

1510
01:35:57,414 --> 01:36:00,047
I'm leaving town...
for good.

1511
01:41:39,914 --> 01:41:41,580
18 minutes exactly.

1512
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:05,281
Mmm! Such a mechanism.

1513
01:42:05,348 --> 01:42:06,780
Yes, yes.

1514
01:42:06,847 --> 01:42:10,281
Poppa, I'm seeing things
in you I never saw before.

1515
01:42:10,348 --> 01:42:11,280
Yeah?

1516
01:42:11,847 --> 01:42:13,914
That's all,
Mr. Gershwin.

1517
01:42:13,981 --> 01:42:16,081
You may
get dressed now.

1518
01:42:21,147 --> 01:42:23,580
Here are the laboratory reports, Doctor.

1519
01:42:23,647 --> 01:42:25,580
Thanks.

1520
01:42:25,647 --> 01:42:27,513
Well, Doctor?

1521
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:29,513
It's leukemia.

1522
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:30,981
Leukemia?

1523
01:42:31,047 --> 01:42:33,814
Say, what is this
fancy-sounding disease?

1524
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:37,613
The white blood cells keep
eating up the red ones.

1525
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:39,081
And is that bad?

1526
01:42:39,147 --> 01:42:40,647
Very bad.

1527
01:42:40,714 --> 01:42:42,314
How bad
is it?

1528
01:42:42,381 --> 01:42:44,014
Shall I be
honest?

1529
01:42:44,081 --> 01:42:46,513
Always the best policy.

1530
01:42:46,580 --> 01:42:50,714
Half a year. Month or two either way.

1531
01:42:55,247 --> 01:42:57,181
Piece of peppermint,
doctor?

1532
01:42:57,247 --> 01:42:58,880
Thanks.

1533
01:43:01,381 --> 01:43:03,480
No mistake?

1534
01:43:03,547 --> 01:43:05,348
No mistake.

1535
01:43:06,747 --> 01:43:08,348
Ok.

1536
01:43:12,081 --> 01:43:13,914
Ira...

1537
01:43:13,981 --> 01:43:17,047
When does George
come home from Cuba?

1538
01:43:17,114 --> 01:43:19,880
He's planning a concert tour, Poppa.

1539
01:43:26,414 --> 01:43:32,281
You know, sometimes I
think George is unhappy.

1540
01:43:32,348 --> 01:43:34,847
Success isn't enough.

1541
01:43:36,414 --> 01:43:39,814
I want you
to take care of him, Ira.

1542
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:42,014
Watch over him always.

1543
01:43:43,414 --> 01:43:45,214
Don't worry,
Poppa.

1544
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:49,814
You'll do me
a big favor, Ira.

1545
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:51,547
Ira.

1546
01:43:53,281 --> 01:43:56,647
Why should George know,
or Momma?

1547
01:43:56,714 --> 01:43:58,580
Why should we worry them?

1548
01:43:58,647 --> 01:44:02,014
We'll keep it a secret
between you and me.

1549
01:44:02,081 --> 01:44:03,547
Accidentally on purpose

1550
01:44:03,613 --> 01:44:06,214
We'll forget
to tell them, hmm?

1551
01:44:14,381 --> 01:44:16,880
A trick
before high heaven.

1552
01:44:16,947 --> 01:44:19,381
Yes, makes
the angels weep.

1553
01:44:19,448 --> 01:44:20,880
What's that?

1554
01:44:20,947 --> 01:44:23,880
Why, the rest of your
quotation, Mr. Gershwin,

1555
01:44:23,947 --> 01:44:25,381
From Shakespeare.

1556
01:44:25,448 --> 01:44:27,381
I spoke a quotation?
Yes.

1557
01:44:27,448 --> 01:44:31,281
How do you like that,
Ira? I spoke a quotation...

1558
01:44:31,348 --> 01:44:33,480
From Shakespeare.

1559
01:44:33,547 --> 01:44:35,181
Good-bye,
Doctor.

1560
01:44:47,314 --> 01:44:48,314
George!

1561
01:44:48,381 --> 01:44:49,981
Momma.

1562
01:44:54,747 --> 01:44:56,181
How's my Poppa?

1563
01:44:56,247 --> 01:44:57,680
Georgie.

1564
01:44:57,747 --> 01:45:00,181
I think I'll
have to take you

1565
01:45:00,247 --> 01:45:02,680
To the mountains
for a few weeks.

1566
01:45:02,747 --> 01:45:04,814
Take Momma.

1567
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:07,381
Are you happy, Georgie?

1568
01:45:08,580 --> 01:45:12,181
You're beginning to lose
your hair, my boy.

1569
01:45:12,247 --> 01:45:14,847
I still have
more than you.

1570
01:45:16,448 --> 01:45:20,314
You're crowding
too many things.

1571
01:45:20,381 --> 01:45:24,513
You should take more time
to be happy, Georgie.

1572
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:28,448
With all due respect...

1573
01:45:28,513 --> 01:45:31,680
It should have been Julie.

1574
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:37,547
Poppa.

1575
01:45:37,613 --> 01:45:39,114
Poppa!

1576
01:45:39,181 --> 01:45:41,547
Hmm?

1577
01:45:41,613 --> 01:45:44,947
People like
the Cuban Overture?

1578
01:45:45,014 --> 01:45:47,780
It gets a very
good hand, Poppa.

1579
01:45:47,847 --> 01:45:49,281
You'll hear it soon.

1580
01:45:49,348 --> 01:45:53,147
How long
does it run, Georgie?

1581
01:45:53,214 --> 01:45:55,647
Exactly how long?

1582
01:45:56,914 --> 01:45:58,947
10 minutes, Poppa.

1583
01:45:59,014 --> 01:46:01,214
10 minutes exactly.

1584
01:46:01,281 --> 01:46:03,680
10 minutes.

1585
01:46:06,181 --> 01:46:08,780
Good.

1586
01:46:08,847 --> 01:46:12,780
An important...

1587
01:46:12,847 --> 01:46:15,348
Piece.

1588
01:46:15,414 --> 01:46:17,281
Poppa.

1589
01:46:17,348 --> 01:46:19,348
Poppa!

1590
01:46:19,414 --> 01:46:22,847
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1591
01:47:20,714 --> 01:47:21,414
Mine...

1592
01:47:21,418 --> 01:47:23,480
The point they're making in the song

1593
01:47:23,547 --> 01:47:24,667
Love is mine...

1594
01:47:24,668 --> 01:47:26,981
Is that they more than get along

1595
01:47:27,047 --> 01:47:28,989
Whether it's rain or storm...

1596
01:47:28,990 --> 01:47:31,081
And he is not ashamed to say

1597
01:47:31,147 --> 01:47:32,209
Or shine...

1598
01:47:32,210 --> 01:47:34,914
She made him what he is today

1599
01:47:34,981 --> 01:47:35,681
Mine...

1600
01:47:35,683 --> 01:47:37,780
It does a person good to see

1601
01:47:37,847 --> 01:47:39,239
You are mine...

1602
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:41,281
Such happy domesticity

1603
01:47:41,348 --> 01:47:42,686
Never another...

1604
01:47:42,687 --> 01:47:45,947
The way they're making love, you'd swear

1605
01:47:46,014 --> 01:47:46,714
Valentine...

1606
01:47:46,716 --> 01:47:47,914
They're not a married pair

1607
01:47:47,981 --> 01:47:49,508
And I am yours...

1608
01:47:49,509 --> 01:47:52,114
He says no matter what occurs

1609
01:47:52,181 --> 01:47:53,769
Tell me that I'm yours...

1610
01:47:53,770 --> 01:47:55,547
Whatever he may have is hers

1611
01:47:55,613 --> 01:47:57,350
Show me that smile...

1612
01:47:57,351 --> 01:47:59,914
The point that she is making is

1613
01:47:59,981 --> 01:48:01,442
My heart adores...

1614
01:48:01,443 --> 01:48:03,714
Whatever she may have is his

1615
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:06,580
Mine

1616
01:48:06,647 --> 01:48:10,448
More than divine

1617
01:48:10,513 --> 01:48:13,814
To know that love
like yours

1618
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:18,114
Is mine!

1619
01:48:19,348 --> 01:48:20,814
If the rest
of the show

1620
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:22,281
Is as good
as that song,

1621
01:48:22,348 --> 01:48:23,780
You'll have
another hit.

1622
01:48:23,847 --> 01:48:26,914
With a little more suffering,
I could become a great singer.

1623
01:48:26,981 --> 01:48:28,647
We've been doing the suffering, my boy.

1624
01:48:28,714 --> 01:48:30,480
Now let's go
home and to bed.

1625
01:48:30,547 --> 01:48:31,947
It's time
for breakfast.

1626
01:48:32,014 --> 01:48:34,147
What does your father say
when you come home so late?

1627
01:48:35,513 --> 01:48:37,981
What's the matter? You
fellas quitting already?

1628
01:48:38,047 --> 01:48:39,613
I got a date
with my insomnia.

1629
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:41,147
We haven't even
started yet.

1630
01:48:41,214 --> 01:48:42,647
What's the rush,
George?

1631
01:48:42,714 --> 01:48:45,014
You can do all this during rehearsals.

1632
01:48:45,081 --> 01:48:47,880
I want to get this done
and start on something new.

1633
01:48:47,947 --> 01:48:49,448
How do you
like the fella?

1634
01:48:49,513 --> 01:48:51,513
Of Thee I Sing just
won the Pulitzer Prize,

1635
01:48:51,580 --> 01:48:54,014
He's got another show in rehearsal,
and now he's talking about-

1636
01:48:54,081 --> 01:48:56,381
I'm not talking about another
show. I want to do something else.

1637
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:57,981
What is it,
Georgie?

1638
01:48:58,047 --> 01:48:59,513
What do you
want to do?

1639
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:01,348
I've been thinking
about an opera.

1640
01:49:01,414 --> 01:49:04,114
It's 4:00 in the morning, and
he's thinking about an opera.

1641
01:49:04,181 --> 01:49:05,714
Don't you think
I can do it?

1642
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:07,081
Of course
you can, George,

1643
01:49:07,147 --> 01:49:08,381
But what kind
of opera?

1644
01:49:08,448 --> 01:49:09,647
I don't know exactly.

1645
01:49:09,714 --> 01:49:11,880
I'd like to use
a folk theme,

1646
01:49:11,947 --> 01:49:14,014
Something American
if I can find it.

1647
01:49:14,081 --> 01:49:16,181
If anybody wants to find
this penthouse beachcomber,

1648
01:49:16,247 --> 01:49:19,348
You'll find him over at
Ira's kitchen. Come on, Ira.

1649
01:49:19,414 --> 01:49:21,814
Let's close up shop.
We've been working all night.

1650
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:23,214
Nonsense. We've got
too much to do.

1651
01:49:23,281 --> 01:49:25,381
You can go on if you
want to. I'm going home.

1652
01:49:25,448 --> 01:49:27,414
But we should try to
- Let me go home, will you?

1653
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:29,513
I want to see if Lee
still remembers me.

1654
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:30,981
You remember Lee-my wife.

1655
01:49:31,047 --> 01:49:34,513
Ok, Ira. Good night. Tell her
I said your lyrics are swell.

1656
01:49:34,580 --> 01:49:35,847
Thanks, Mr. Music.

1657
01:49:35,914 --> 01:49:37,381
Good night,
Mr. Words.

1658
01:49:43,414 --> 01:49:46,181
Well, George, what is it
you're trying to forget?

1659
01:49:46,247 --> 01:49:47,680
Forget?

1660
01:49:47,747 --> 01:49:50,547
Don't tell me you've turned
yourself into a dynamo

1661
01:49:50,613 --> 01:49:54,081
Just for the fun of grinding
out one hit after another.

1662
01:49:54,147 --> 01:49:56,647
Success is coming
out of your ears.

1663
01:49:56,714 --> 01:50:00,714
Why don't you relax and
just be a human being again?

1664
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:03,414
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1665
01:50:05,281 --> 01:50:07,580
I'm talking
about you.

1666
01:50:12,014 --> 01:50:15,414
I can see a boy way down in
those streets who dreamed himself

1667
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:17,480
A long way from
the ground he started on.

1668
01:50:17,547 --> 01:50:19,047
Came up like an elevator.

1669
01:50:19,114 --> 01:50:21,547
Now he's looking
for new buttons to push.

1670
01:50:21,613 --> 01:50:24,547
Seems to have an idea
that happiness is vertical

1671
01:50:24,613 --> 01:50:26,680
And the last stop is heaven.

1672
01:50:26,747 --> 01:50:29,348
Quit it,
will you, Max?

1673
01:50:29,414 --> 01:50:31,348
I thought you'd finished
your portrait.

1674
01:50:31,414 --> 01:50:34,348
I don't know if I'll
ever get it done.

1675
01:50:34,414 --> 01:50:36,814
It's beginning
to get on my nerves.

1676
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:40,348
Every time I look at myself,
I see something different.

1677
01:50:40,414 --> 01:50:43,847
I can't get George Gershwin
to stay on the canvas.

1678
01:50:43,914 --> 01:50:45,847
He keeps running
away from me.

1679
01:50:45,914 --> 01:50:50,348
I can see 4 Georges, and heaven
knows how many more there are-

1680
01:50:50,414 --> 01:50:53,847
The man who writes hits,
the man who dreams,

1681
01:50:53,914 --> 01:50:57,114
The man who climbs
the golden stairs,

1682
01:50:57,181 --> 01:51:00,381
And maybe there's one
left over for Julie.

1683
01:51:00,448 --> 01:51:03,448
Shut up, Max! If you're
going to talk like that,

1684
01:51:03,513 --> 01:51:05,081
Get out of my house.

1685
01:51:09,448 --> 01:51:11,381
Max, Max.

1686
01:51:11,448 --> 01:51:13,348
I didn't mean that.

1687
01:51:13,414 --> 01:51:16,547
I don't want to hurt you. You know that.

1688
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:20,348
I don't want
to hurt anyone.

1689
01:51:23,747 --> 01:51:25,680
These headaches...

1690
01:51:28,513 --> 01:51:30,847
I guess
you're right, Max.

1691
01:51:30,914 --> 01:51:33,480
Part of me
is lonely.

1692
01:51:33,547 --> 01:51:36,480
Part of me got
lost somewhere.

1693
01:51:36,547 --> 01:51:39,981
Maybe way down deep,
I'm just a family man...

1694
01:51:40,047 --> 01:51:41,448
Without a family.

1695
01:51:41,513 --> 01:51:44,947
I'm proud of you,
George.

1696
01:51:45,014 --> 01:51:48,181
To me, you're the voice
of your generation.

1697
01:51:48,247 --> 01:51:51,348
I just want
to see you happy.

1698
01:51:51,414 --> 01:51:53,714
That's why
I mentioned Julie.

1699
01:51:56,914 --> 01:51:58,547
Good night.

1700
01:52:08,647 --> 01:52:13,880
You're so delici-ous

1701
01:52:13,947 --> 01:52:16,880
And so caprici-ous

1702
01:52:16,947 --> 01:52:19,780
I grow ambiti-ous

1703
01:52:19,847 --> 01:52:23,613
To have you care
for me

1704
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:27,081
In that connect-ion

1705
01:52:27,147 --> 01:52:30,281
You're my select-ion

1706
01:52:30,348 --> 01:52:32,847
For true affect-ion

1707
01:52:32,914 --> 01:52:36,381
For all the time
to be

1708
01:52:36,448 --> 01:52:43,448
Now, I've had 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10 beaus before

1709
01:52:43,747 --> 01:52:48,547
But you're the one,
the only one

1710
01:52:48,613 --> 01:52:54,714
The one beau I adore

1711
01:52:54,780 --> 01:52:59,081
Yes, on reflect-ion

1712
01:52:59,147 --> 01:53:02,047
In that connect-ion

1713
01:53:02,114 --> 01:53:04,314
If you've
no object-ion

1714
01:53:04,381 --> 01:53:08,448
To me, you're just
perfect-ion

1715
01:53:08,513 --> 01:53:11,181
If you're suspici-ous

1716
01:53:11,247 --> 01:53:13,714
Why, I'm repetiti-ous

1717
01:53:13,780 --> 01:53:17,414
It's 'cause you're so

1718
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:19,547
Delici-ous

1719
01:53:34,414 --> 01:53:36,247
What on earth are you
doing in Florida, George?

1720
01:53:36,314 --> 01:53:38,981
I was just about to
ask you the same thing.

1721
01:53:39,047 --> 01:53:41,814
That's easy.
I'm earning a living.

1722
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:45,880
Why did you turn down
my shows? Why, Julie?

1723
01:53:47,081 --> 01:53:51,014
We've been all over
that once, George.

1724
01:53:51,081 --> 01:53:53,714
I want you
to come back.

1725
01:53:56,181 --> 01:53:58,547
Why did you come?

1726
01:54:00,214 --> 01:54:02,114
To see you.

1727
01:54:04,247 --> 01:54:07,081
Well, that-that's
very friendly, but-

1728
01:54:07,147 --> 01:54:10,547
Julie, don't talk like that,
as if we were strangers.

1729
01:54:10,613 --> 01:54:12,981
I need you, Julie.
I've always needed you.

1730
01:54:13,047 --> 01:54:16,181
That's a romantic notion,
George.

1731
01:54:16,247 --> 01:54:18,181
You don't need anyone.

1732
01:54:19,580 --> 01:54:22,880
How does it feel to be
sitting on top of the world?

1733
01:54:22,947 --> 01:54:25,381
Remember the time
you had your first flop?

1734
01:54:25,448 --> 01:54:29,981
You were a child, but you said
you didn't have time for flops.

1735
01:54:30,047 --> 01:54:32,147
You had too much to do.

1736
01:54:32,214 --> 01:54:36,814
Well, now you've done more than
even you could have dreamed of then.

1737
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:39,281
I'm not so sure
of that.

1738
01:54:39,348 --> 01:54:41,381
You'd always feel
that way.

1739
01:54:41,448 --> 01:54:43,381
That's part
of your restlessness.

1740
01:54:43,448 --> 01:54:46,081
Maybe it's even
part of your music.

1741
01:54:47,448 --> 01:54:50,348
I've found you can live
in a penthouse,

1742
01:54:50,414 --> 01:54:52,414
Surrounded by people,

1743
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:54,414
And still be alone.

1744
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,214
Poppa knew that.

1745
01:54:56,281 --> 01:55:01,181
The last thing he said was,
"it should have been Julie."

1746
01:55:01,247 --> 01:55:04,348
It should have been
Julie. It still can be.

1747
01:55:04,414 --> 01:55:07,680
I want you to come back.
Please, you must.

1748
01:55:07,747 --> 01:55:09,580
George,
please don't go on.

1749
01:55:11,613 --> 01:55:12,747
Oh, Herb. Herb!

1750
01:55:12,814 --> 01:55:14,714
Yes, Julie?

1751
01:55:17,081 --> 01:55:20,014
George, this is Herb
Stone, the orchestra leader.

1752
01:55:20,081 --> 01:55:21,513
Of course.

1753
01:55:21,580 --> 01:55:22,981
Herb, this is-

1754
01:55:23,047 --> 01:55:26,014
George Gershwin. How nice to meet you.

1755
01:55:26,081 --> 01:55:27,547
You see, George...

1756
01:55:27,613 --> 01:55:29,947
Herb and I are engaged to be married.

1757
01:55:30,014 --> 01:55:33,448
Julie, I-

1758
01:55:33,513 --> 01:55:35,247
Thank you,
Mr. Gershwin.

1759
01:55:35,314 --> 01:55:36,947
Julie, this is a-

1760
01:55:40,214 --> 01:55:42,547
Congratulations.

1761
01:55:45,314 --> 01:55:47,147
Good night, Julie.

1762
01:56:01,281 --> 01:56:04,680
Julie, darling, what'd
you tell him that for?

1763
01:56:04,747 --> 01:56:06,680
I'm sorry, Herb.

1764
01:56:06,747 --> 01:56:10,647
I had to tell him
something to make him go.

1765
01:56:10,714 --> 01:56:12,181
George Gershwin.

1766
01:56:12,247 --> 01:56:14,381
And you don't
love him?

1767
01:56:16,580 --> 01:56:18,680
I never said that.

1768
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:31,414
Summertime

1769
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:38,414
And the livin' is easy

1770
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:43,381
Fish are jumpin'

1771
01:56:43,448 --> 01:56:50,448
And the cotton is high

1772
01:56:51,147 --> 01:56:56,247
Oh, your daddy's rich

1773
01:56:56,314 --> 01:57:03,314
And your ma
is good-lookin'

1774
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:08,281
So hush, little baby

1775
01:57:08,348 --> 01:57:15,348
Don't you cry

1776
01:57:16,513 --> 01:57:21,780
One of these
mornin's

1777
01:57:21,847 --> 01:57:28,847
You're gonna rise up
singin'

1778
01:57:29,214 --> 01:57:34,181
Then you'll spread
your wings

1779
01:57:34,247 --> 01:57:41,247
And you'll take
the sky

1780
01:57:41,513 --> 01:57:47,747
But till that mornin'

1781
01:57:47,814 --> 01:57:54,814
There's a-nothin'
can harm you

1782
01:57:55,381 --> 01:57:59,381
With daddy and mammy

1783
01:57:59,448 --> 01:58:06,448
Standin' by

1784
01:58:30,847 --> 01:58:32,247
Most of the audience
loved it.

1785
01:58:32,314 --> 01:58:34,513
Tell me the worst. What
did the critics say?

1786
01:58:34,580 --> 01:58:36,414
Some of them said
it wasn't opera.

1787
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:40,348
Why wasn't it opera? Just
because ordinary people liked it?

1788
01:58:40,414 --> 01:58:42,448
Others said
it wasn't Gershwin.

1789
01:58:42,513 --> 01:58:46,381
After spending two of the
hardest years of my life.

1790
01:58:46,448 --> 01:58:48,780
If that isn't
Gershwin, what is?

1791
01:58:48,847 --> 01:58:51,214
In all the years we've
been together, George,

1792
01:58:51,281 --> 01:58:53,247
I've been right,
now and then,

1793
01:58:53,314 --> 01:58:55,547
But about Porgy and Bess,
I was wrong.

1794
01:58:55,613 --> 01:58:57,947
This time,
you've done it, my boy.

1795
01:58:58,014 --> 01:59:00,047
You've made opera
entertaining.

1796
01:59:12,314 --> 01:59:13,580
The nearer we get
to the coast,

1797
01:59:13,647 --> 01:59:15,381
The faster
the train goes.

1798
01:59:16,947 --> 01:59:18,947
Speed-
How I love it.

1799
01:59:19,014 --> 01:59:20,414
Listen
to the wheels, Ira.

1800
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:23,947
Got to make time.
Got to make time.

1801
01:59:24,014 --> 01:59:26,580
Folks
with plenty of plenty

1802
01:59:26,647 --> 01:59:29,880
Keep their locks
on the door

1803
01:59:29,947 --> 01:59:31,314
The porter, sir.

1804
01:59:31,381 --> 01:59:34,448
What critic said Porgy
and Bess was too highbrow?

1805
01:59:34,513 --> 01:59:35,680
Come in.

1806
01:59:35,747 --> 01:59:37,147
Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah!

1807
01:59:37,214 --> 01:59:39,680
I thought we lost you at Albuquerque.

1808
01:59:39,747 --> 01:59:42,847
I had to autograph some
blankets. Here's the telegram.

1809
01:59:43,914 --> 01:59:45,880
From Los Angeles.

1810
01:59:45,947 --> 01:59:47,880
"We wish you
to perform

1811
01:59:47,947 --> 01:59:49,680
"An all-Gershwin
concert

1812
01:59:49,747 --> 01:59:51,714
"February 10.

1813
01:59:51,780 --> 01:59:53,680
The Los Angeles
Philharmonic."

1814
01:59:53,747 --> 01:59:55,513
That's the chance
I've been waiting for.

1815
01:59:55,580 --> 01:59:58,480
Play good, George, and
I'll get a job in pictures.

1817
01:59:59,613 --> 02:00:00,714
Good night, Ira.

1818
02:00:00,780 --> 02:00:02,014
Happy dreams,
Oscar.

1819
02:00:02,081 --> 02:00:03,714
Think about
that concert.

1820
02:00:08,081 --> 02:00:10,680
The difference between an
upper berth and a lower berth

1821
02:00:10,747 --> 02:00:13,414
Is the difference
between talent and genius.

1822
02:00:16,281 --> 02:00:18,714
Got to
make time. Got to make time.

1823
02:00:18,780 --> 02:00:22,714
Got to make time.
Got to make time.

1824
02:00:22,780 --> 02:00:25,081
Got to make time.
Got to make time...

1825
02:05:01,414 --> 02:05:02,780
Georgie, what is it?

1826
02:05:02,847 --> 02:05:04,281
What's happened?

1827
02:05:04,348 --> 02:05:06,247
My fingers
wouldn't obey.

1828
02:05:06,314 --> 02:05:08,780
But you've only played
it a hundred times.

1829
02:05:08,847 --> 02:05:11,281
And then the pain
between my eyes,

1830
02:05:11,348 --> 02:05:12,780
Like a knife.

1831
02:05:14,348 --> 02:05:15,747
Oscar, talk to the crowd.

1832
02:05:15,814 --> 02:05:18,480
Hold them off
until we get out.

1833
02:05:21,081 --> 02:05:22,780
George.

1834
02:05:22,847 --> 02:05:24,580
Georgie.

1835
02:05:25,947 --> 02:05:28,814
You're coming home
with me.

1836
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:31,680
Come. We'll go home.

1837
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:36,513
Ira, what's happening to my boy?

1838
02:05:36,580 --> 02:05:39,247
Please
don't worry, Momma.

1839
02:05:39,314 --> 02:05:42,747
No, you can't talk to him
now. He's resting, Momma.

1840
02:05:42,814 --> 02:05:45,314
But it isn't right for
me to be so far away

1841
02:05:45,381 --> 02:05:46,814
When my George
is ill.

1842
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:48,647
Ira, I'm coming out
by plane.

1843
02:05:48,714 --> 02:05:52,981
No, Momma, please. We'll have him
back in New York in a few weeks,

1844
02:05:53,047 --> 02:05:55,147
And then we'll all
be together again.

1845
02:05:55,214 --> 02:05:59,647
All right. I'll
call you tomorrow.

1846
02:05:59,714 --> 02:06:01,680
Ira...

1847
02:06:01,747 --> 02:06:04,680
Take care of him.

1848
02:06:04,747 --> 02:06:06,147
Good night.

1849
02:06:06,214 --> 02:06:08,381
Good night, Momma.

1850
02:06:17,247 --> 02:06:18,680
Ira, these lyrics
are wonderful.

1851
02:06:18,747 --> 02:06:20,147
They are good,
aren't they?

1852
02:06:20,214 --> 02:06:21,680
They practically
sing themselves.

1853
02:06:21,747 --> 02:06:23,580
You could use your voice, too, you know.

1854
02:06:23,647 --> 02:06:25,114
When George is finished playing,

1855
02:06:25,181 --> 02:06:27,181
Maybe he'll go over it with you.

1856
02:06:47,947 --> 02:06:49,714
I'm getting
scared, Oscar.

1857
02:06:49,780 --> 02:06:52,214
I think it's a nervous breakdown.

1858
02:06:52,281 --> 02:06:54,047
You exaggerate, Ira.

1859
02:06:54,114 --> 02:06:55,847
You think so?

1860
02:06:55,914 --> 02:06:57,714
No, I don't.

1861
02:07:09,981 --> 02:07:12,780
Is there something
I can do, Georgie?

1862
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:18,414
I've just got
a headache.

1863
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:22,081
Maybe it's us. Maybe
we get on your nerves.

1864
02:07:22,147 --> 02:07:25,414
It's this stabbing pain in my head.

1865
02:07:25,480 --> 02:07:28,647
I'm sick,
that's all.

1866
02:07:28,714 --> 02:07:32,214
Hold my hand,
Ira... tight.

1867
02:07:34,247 --> 02:07:37,147
It eases the pain.

1868
02:07:37,214 --> 02:07:38,981
Yes, Georgie.

1869
02:07:42,214 --> 02:07:44,147
Your kid brother
is giving you

1870
02:07:44,214 --> 02:07:46,147
A lot of trouble,
isn't he?

1871
02:07:46,214 --> 02:07:48,147
Let's forget
all this work.

1872
02:07:48,214 --> 02:07:50,147
Somebody else
can finish it.

1873
02:07:50,214 --> 02:07:52,348
6 months' rest
is what you need.

1874
02:07:52,414 --> 02:07:54,381
I'd blow up
in a thousand pieces

1875
02:07:54,448 --> 02:07:56,381
If I didn't work
for that long.

1876
02:07:56,448 --> 02:07:59,381
You'll blow up anyway if
you don't quit for a while.

1877
02:07:59,448 --> 02:08:01,114
I can't help it.

1878
02:08:02,780 --> 02:08:07,647
Work is a compulsion. It's an obsession.

1879
02:08:07,714 --> 02:08:10,181
And there's so much
I want to do.

1880
02:08:10,247 --> 02:08:13,281
What are you trying to prove,
Georgie? You've already-

1881
02:08:13,348 --> 02:08:15,414
Don't you see, Ira?

1882
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:16,914
It's only
with my music

1883
02:08:16,981 --> 02:08:19,613
That I can prove
my right to live.

1884
02:08:19,680 --> 02:08:21,613
I must write...

1885
02:08:24,780 --> 02:08:29,847
And I can't even hear
it inside me anymore.

1886
02:08:39,081 --> 02:08:41,480
Hello?

1887
02:08:41,547 --> 02:08:43,214
New York?

1888
02:08:46,947 --> 02:08:48,914
Just a moment, please.

1889
02:08:54,247 --> 02:08:55,847
George...

1890
02:08:55,914 --> 02:08:57,714
It's Julie.

1891
02:08:59,547 --> 02:09:01,214
Julie.

1892
02:09:02,613 --> 02:09:04,580
Talk to her, George.

1893
02:09:19,981 --> 02:09:21,580
Julie?

1894
02:09:22,814 --> 02:09:25,513
Oh, Julie.

1895
02:09:25,580 --> 02:09:28,181
Just your voice.
I've been so lonely.

1896
02:09:28,247 --> 02:09:30,381
George,
please let me come out.

1897
02:09:30,448 --> 02:09:35,381
I can't bear to be so far away when
you're ill. I can take the next plane.

1898
02:09:35,448 --> 02:09:38,580
Meet me, darling.
We mustn't waste a minute.

1899
02:09:40,281 --> 02:09:42,814
George, do you hear me?

1900
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:44,448
Yes, darling.

1901
02:09:44,547 --> 02:09:46,847
You're right.
I need you.

1902
02:09:46,914 --> 02:09:51,880
Come out here, and we'll make
up for all the lost years.

1903
02:09:51,947 --> 02:09:55,880
Remember? I have the longest
lifeline you ever saw.

1904
02:09:55,947 --> 02:09:59,081
Hurry, darling.
Hurry.

1905
02:10:12,281 --> 02:10:14,680
Tinker, wake up.
Wake up, Tinker.

1906
02:10:14,747 --> 02:10:17,914
You can't sleep now.
Julie is coming.

1907
02:10:22,448 --> 02:10:24,613
Wake up, Tinker.

1908
02:10:42,214 --> 02:10:43,613
Good news from Julie?

1909
02:10:43,680 --> 02:10:45,314
She's coming out here. George, I don't-

1910
02:10:45,381 --> 02:10:47,647
I'm all right. My headache
is gone, and I can play.

1911
02:10:47,714 --> 02:10:49,314
Don't overdo it, Georgie.
Take it easy, fella.

1912
02:10:49,381 --> 02:10:51,480
Why should I take it easy?
I feel wonderful.

1913
02:10:51,547 --> 02:10:53,647
Now we can finish
the score of the picture

1914
02:10:53,714 --> 02:10:55,214
And get on
with something else.

1915
02:10:55,281 --> 02:10:59,714
I'd like to try a ballet. Or maybe
a string quartet. Or better yet...

1916
02:10:59,780 --> 02:11:02,680
I'd like to set the
Gettysburg Address to music.

1917
02:11:02,747 --> 02:11:05,847
Lee, darling,
Julie is coming.

1918
02:11:05,914 --> 02:11:08,348
So that's it.
How do you feel?

1919
02:11:08,414 --> 02:11:10,047
I'm hungry.

1920
02:11:11,414 --> 02:11:12,847
How about some food?

1921
02:11:12,914 --> 02:11:14,513
I'll get you some
right away.

1922
02:11:14,580 --> 02:11:16,014
I'm hungry,
too, lee,

1923
02:11:16,081 --> 02:11:17,914
But I got to
catch a plane.

1924
02:11:17,981 --> 02:11:19,480
What for?

1925
02:11:19,547 --> 02:11:22,914
I'm broadcasting our
concerto in new york.

1926
02:11:22,981 --> 02:11:24,814
Oscar...

1927
02:11:24,880 --> 02:11:26,680
Yes?

1928
02:11:26,747 --> 02:11:30,314
Remember, it's a very important piece.

1929
02:11:32,580 --> 02:11:35,014
Be sure and give
our love to Momma.

1930
02:11:35,081 --> 02:11:36,314
I will.

1931
02:11:36,381 --> 02:11:37,814
Lots of luck,
Oscar.

1932
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:39,314
Thanks.

1933
02:11:42,214 --> 02:11:44,348
Take care
of yourself, George.

1934
02:11:47,147 --> 02:11:48,613
Steve, do you know
the lyrics?

1935
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:49,981
I've been working
with Ira.

1936
02:11:50,047 --> 02:11:51,314
Fine. Then let's
make music.

1937
02:11:54,847 --> 02:11:57,847
Love walked right in

1938
02:11:57,914 --> 02:12:02,348
And drove
the shadows away

1939
02:12:02,414 --> 02:12:05,214
Love walked right in

1940
02:12:05,281 --> 02:12:09,513
And brought
my sunniest day

1941
02:12:09,580 --> 02:12:12,847
One magic moment

1942
02:12:12,914 --> 02:12:16,880
And my heart
seemed to know

1943
02:12:16,947 --> 02:12:21,381
That love said hello

1944
02:12:21,448 --> 02:12:27,047
Though not a word
was spoken

1945
02:12:27,114 --> 02:12:34,114
One look, and I forgot
the gloom of the past

1946
02:12:34,680 --> 02:12:41,513
One look, and I had
found my future at last

1947
02:12:41,580 --> 02:12:47,348
One look, and I had
found a world

1948
02:12:47,414 --> 02:12:50,847
Completely new

1949
02:12:50,914 --> 02:12:54,680
When love walked in

1950
02:12:54,747 --> 02:12:55,981
With you

1951
02:12:56,047 --> 02:12:59,081
George! George!

1952
02:14:53,513 --> 02:14:56,981
This is Walter Damrosch speaking.

1953
02:14:57,047 --> 02:14:59,647
Ladies and gentlemen,

1954
02:14:59,714 --> 02:15:02,314
We have interrupted
the concerto

1955
02:15:02,381 --> 02:15:06,014
To tell you that its
composer, George Gershwin,

1956
02:15:06,081 --> 02:15:09,314
Has just passed away
in California.

1957
02:15:13,814 --> 02:15:16,780
We will continue
the Concerto in F.

1958
02:15:54,214 --> 02:15:55,613
George Gershwin
will live

1959
02:15:55,680 --> 02:15:57,281
As long as there is joy,

1960
02:15:57,348 --> 02:15:59,981
As long as there is music
in the world.

1961
02:16:00,047 --> 02:16:01,613
He was a lucky young man,

1962
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:04,314
Lucky to be so in love
with the world

1963
02:16:04,381 --> 02:16:07,747
And because the world
was so in love with him.

1964
02:16:07,814 --> 02:16:11,181
He had the happy faculty
of enjoying all his talents,

1965
02:16:11,247 --> 02:16:13,414
And through them,
he gave voice

1966
02:16:13,480 --> 02:16:16,547
To the America he knew
and loved so well.

1967
02:16:16,613 --> 02:16:20,448
We rejoice that through
his imperishable harmonies,

1968
02:16:20,513 --> 02:16:24,181
George Gershwin
will forever sing to us.

1969
02:16:24,247 --> 02:16:26,281
We weep that in passing,

1970
02:16:26,348 --> 02:16:30,014
He left so many songs
unsung.

1971
02:16:30,081 --> 02:16:33,580
And now the orchestra, with
Mr. Paul Whiteman conducting,

1972
02:16:33,647 --> 02:16:36,047
Will play
the Rhapsody in Blue.

1973
02:16:36,114 --> 02:16:38,480
At the piano,
George's friend,

1974
02:16:38,547 --> 02:16:40,448
Mr. Oscar Levant.
