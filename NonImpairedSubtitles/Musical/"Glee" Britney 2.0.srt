1
00:00:00,028 --> 00:00:02,226
<i>So here's what you missed
on </i>Glee: <i>Rachel's in New York,</i>

2
00:00:02,267 --> 00:00:04,271
<i>and her new friend Brody is way
hot, but Finn's still M.I.A,</i>

3
00:00:04,272 --> 00:00:06,250
<i>and her dance teacher Cassandra
totally hates her guts.</i>

4
00:00:06,251 --> 00:00:07,916
<i>Thank God Kurt showed up,
so now they can be classic</i>

5
00:00:07,917 --> 00:00:09,387
<i>New York roommates and shop
for shoes and stuff.</i>

6
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:11,250
<i>There's a new girl
in Glee Club named Marley,</i>

7
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:12,641
<i>and she could be
the next big thing.</i>

8
00:00:12,642 --> 00:00:14,329
<i>So could this kid Jake,
and it turns out he's Puck's</i>

9
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,275
<i>half brother and Puck totally
doesn't know about him.</i>

10
00:00:16,276 --> 00:00:17,431
<i>And that's what you
missed on </i>Glee.

11
00:00:22,302 --> 00:00:25,251
<i>My name is Brittany S. Pierce,</i>

12
00:00:25,252 --> 00:00:26,308
<i>and I finally know
how Jesus feels</i>

13
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:28,300
<i>in his house way up
at the North Pole,</i>

14
00:00:28,301 --> 00:00:30,285
<i>because I am on top
of the world.</i>

15
00:00:30,286 --> 00:00:32,251
<i>Senior year was awesome,</i>

16
00:00:32,252 --> 00:00:35,272
and now I get to relive
every minute of it.

17
00:00:35,273 --> 00:00:37,288
I'm head Cheerio!,
vice-Rachel of the glee club,

18
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:38,308
and now I'm planning

19
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:39,329
a Middle East style

20
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,258
sham election
that will install me

21
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:42,331
as senior class president
for life.

22
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:45,255
Brittany, who are
you talking to?

23
00:00:45,256 --> 00:00:47,288
I thought I was doing
a voice-over.

24
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:49,330
Okay.

25
00:00:49,331 --> 00:00:52,301
<i>It was kind of a rough summer.</i>

26
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,272
<i>I really miss Santana, but...</i>

27
00:00:55,273 --> 00:00:57,284
<i>for now,
all I have to say is...</i>

28
00:00:57,285 --> 00:00:59,256
It's Brittany, bitch.

Well, that was just garbage.

00:02:47,285 --> 00:02:49,326
Garbage wrapped in skin.

67
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:53,246
Brittany, my office... now!

68
00:02:53,247 --> 00:02:55,318
Brittany, I'm afraid it's
time for a little tough love.

69
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,259
I hold in my hand
the most recent

70
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,317
algebra test of one
Becky Jackson.

71
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:01,246
Our plucky little Ewok

72
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,292
waddled her way
to a respectable C-plus.

73
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:05,326
Now, your performance,

74
00:03:05,327 --> 00:03:07,267
very same exam,

75
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:09,284
unearthed the hitherto

76
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:11,276
undiscovered grade...

77
00:03:11,277 --> 00:03:12,243
F-minus.

78
00:03:12,244 --> 00:03:14,242
You answered
every question with

79
00:03:14,243 --> 00:03:17,242
"see other side,"
where you composed

80
00:03:17,243 --> 00:03:20,238
an elaborate crayon-scape
entitled "Happyville."

81
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,242
"The town where math
was never invented."

82
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,381
Yeah, that's me,
and that's Santana,

83
00:03:23,382 --> 00:03:25,301
and that's Kurt
and Rachel in Heaven.

84
00:03:25,302 --> 00:03:28,243
- And, look, that's you.
- Brittany,

85
00:03:28,244 --> 00:03:30,237
You're a terrible role model
for the Cheerios!

86
00:03:30,238 --> 00:03:31,279
Last year, I was lost in a haze

87
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,260
of pregnancy hormones,
and I allowed

88
00:03:33,261 --> 00:03:36,242
your record breaking
GPA to slide.

89
00:03:36,243 --> 00:03:38,237
The Cheerios! Grade
point average has dropped

90
00:03:38,238 --> 00:03:40,233
three full points.
My girls no longer see

91
00:03:40,234 --> 00:03:41,423
academic achievement
as a worthy goal,

92
00:03:41,424 --> 00:03:43,242
and yesterday I caught

93
00:03:43,243 --> 00:03:44,888
one of them trying
to marry a squirrel.

94
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,312
That's 'cause I believe
in marriage equality

95
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:47,431
- for all land mammals.
- Brittany,

96
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:49,255
You're off the Cheerios!

97
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:50,312
I'm giving
the top spot to Kitty.

98
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,233
I'm afraid you're
going to have to

99
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:53,243
lose the high pony.

100
00:03:53,244 --> 00:03:55,243
Tough love feels
a lot like "mean."

101

<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

102
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:02,280
Britt, I'm so sorry
Sue was so mean to you.

103
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:04,239
I wish I was there
to make it all better.

104
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,255
Yeah, me too.

105
00:04:05,256 --> 00:04:06,608
Do you think we could
scissor-Skype later?

106
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:08,321
I've got cheer practice
every night till midnight,

107
00:04:08,322 --> 00:04:09,327
until homecoming.

108
00:04:09,328 --> 00:04:12,317
Look, I love you, Britt,
but I'm so late.

109
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,331
I got to go, okay?

110
00:04:13,332 --> 00:04:15,297
- I'll text you if we get a break.
- Okay.

111
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:16,297
Have fun.

112
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,327
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

113
00:04:20,268 --> 00:04:21,318
I'm not speaking to you.

114
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,288
I know you joined a gang.

115
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:25,288
The tango.

116
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:27,266
You have to have it
in your arsenal, people.

117
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,531
The first thing you
need to understand is

118
00:04:28,532 --> 00:04:30,267
it's all about sex.

119
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:32,267
When you are dancing
the tango with someone,

120
00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:34,246
you're seducing them.
Partner up.

121
00:04:34,247 --> 00:04:36,306
We're gonna start
with <i>abrazo, </i>the embrace.

122
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,259
Not you, Schwimmer.

123
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,268
Keep practicing those
jazz hands back in the corner.

124
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:43,288
Wait... but I...
Ms. July...

125
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:45,309
I'm sorry, um...

126
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,242
if I'm ever gonna play Evita,

127
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:48,402
I'm gonna have to
learn how to tango.

128
00:04:48,403 --> 00:04:51,242
We're short a boy,
so a girl needs to sit out.

129
00:04:51,243 --> 00:04:53,309
And you don't have
enough sex appeal

130
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,238
to pull off a credible tango.

131
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:56,529
You're awkward and
tentative in your body,

132
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,318
and you move like
you're ashamed of it.

133
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,242
Arms up!

134
00:05:00,243 --> 00:05:03,238
Ready? Five, six,
seven, eight.

135
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:05,296
One, two, three, four,

136
00:05:05,297 --> 00:05:07,235
five, six, seven, eight.

137
00:05:08,235 --> 00:05:09,241
Sorry I'm late.

138
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,306
Someone stole my compass.

139
00:05:10,307 --> 00:05:12,306
I can't wear my Cheerios!
Uniform anymore,

140
00:05:12,307 --> 00:05:15,238
so I got this outfit
in the lost and found.

141
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:16,256
Take a seat, Britt.

142
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,264
Am I getting kicked off
the glee club, too?

143
00:05:22,265 --> 00:05:23,284
Of course not.

144
00:05:23,285 --> 00:05:25,256
- We're just really concerned about you.
- Yeah.

145
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,255
Um... Brittany,

146
00:05:27,256 --> 00:05:29,267
you know you've had
some setbacks lately,

147
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:31,284
and, um, it looks like
you might be feeling

148
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:32,318
a little bit blue.

149
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,317
That's okay.
I started taking

150
00:05:34,318 --> 00:05:36,285
Lord Tubbington's pills
for feline depression.

151
00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:40,234
Brittany, I-I think you and Emma
should meet daily for a while.

152
00:05:40,235 --> 00:05:42,263
I think you've
underestimated the impact

153
00:05:42,264 --> 00:05:44,306
- being held back has had on you.
- Well, thanks,

154
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:46,317
But I don't really
have any time.

155
00:05:46,318 --> 00:05:48,275
After school,
I'm hopping into bed,

156
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:49,325
eating cashews and bacon,

157
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:51,277
and then watching
<i>The Client List </i>marathon.

158
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:55,255
And with that, I said good-bye,

159
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:56,306
and swooped out the doorway,

160
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:59,268
my voice-over continuing
down the hallway.

161
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,296
Okay, what was that?

162
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:04,317
You know, everything's
been taken away from her.

163
00:06:04,318 --> 00:06:07,292
She doesn't have
anything to hold onto.

164
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:10,326
Clearly, she's lost
her identity.

165
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:11,327
We need to bring Brittany back.

166
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:13,251
<i>Great news, guys.</i>

167
00:06:13,252 --> 00:06:15,255
Principal Figgins has
asked us to perform

168
00:06:15,256 --> 00:06:18,038
at the annual back-to-school
pep rally this week.

169
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:19,312
Now, I understand our
National Champion

170
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,327
street cred has dropped a little
bit since school started,

171
00:06:21,328 --> 00:06:24,284
but this is our chance to
really wow them and get it back.

172
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:27,243
- What are we gonna perform?
- Good question.

173
00:06:27,244 --> 00:06:29,262
We're a family in here,
and when one of our family

174
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,306
is falling down, it's up to us

175
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,306
to get together to
pick them back up.

176
00:06:36,323 --> 00:06:39,272
Oh, my God. Are we doing
Britney Week again?

177
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,283
You really came into your own
during the last Britney Week.

178
00:06:41,284 --> 00:06:43,233
You showed us
the best of Britney.

179
00:06:43,234 --> 00:06:44,306
Youth, energy, confidence.

180
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:46,776
She inspires you,
and you inspire us.

181
00:06:46,777 --> 00:06:48,323
So everyone prepare
a Britney song for the week,

182
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,276
and we're gonna pick one
to do for the pep rally.

183
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,264
And I've asked Blaine and Artie
to give us a little taste

184
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:55,259
of what we're looking for.

185
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,314

So, Britt, what'd you think?

232
00:08:38,324 --> 00:08:41,259
I'm once again inspired by
the awesomeness of Britney.

233
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,242
Thanks, Mr. Shue.

234
00:08:43,243 --> 00:08:45,234
This place is enormous!

235
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:46,442
God, for 1,800 bucks a month,

236
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,827
we could get a shoebox
in Manhattan

237
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:48,922
or this hangar in Bushwick.

238
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:51,291
Yeah, but what's the crime rate
like in this neighborhood?

239
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:52,327
It looks a little shady.

240
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:55,038
Ah, it's better than
Detroit and Damascus.

241
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,310
So what do you think?
Should we take it?

242
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:57,322
Are you crazy?

243
00:08:57,323 --> 00:08:59,281
Living here with you
instead of those dorms?

244
00:08:59,282 --> 00:09:00,289
It's heaven!

245
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,309
Oh, New York Domino's
is so much better

246
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,316
than Lima Domino's.

247
00:09:06,317 --> 00:09:07,318
It's the water.

248
00:09:08,323 --> 00:09:11,242
So have you heard
from Finn at all?

249
00:09:11,243 --> 00:09:13,235
Not since you asked me
yesterday.

250
00:09:14,302 --> 00:09:16,234
He's just giving you
your space.

251
00:09:16,235 --> 00:09:18,318
- I know.
- You want to feel nostalgic?

252
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:20,318
- Mmm.
- Blaine said they're doing

253
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:21,425
Britney Spears again
in Glee Club.

254
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:23,308
Oh, my God. It feels like
such a long time ago

255
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:24,427
since we've been
in the choir room.

256
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:27,259
We are living
in the future, Rachel.

257
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,256
- Speaking of which, my plan.
- Okay.

258
00:09:30,257 --> 00:09:31,831
I'm gonna re-audition for
second semester in NYADA.

259
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:33,239
- Good.
- In the meantime,

260
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,233
I've applied for a job

261
00:09:34,234 --> 00:09:35,723
at the only place I feel
will truly appreciate

262
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:39,246
my sense of style and
Vogue.com.

263
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:41,235
- Perfect.
- I know it sounds crazy,

264
00:09:41,236 --> 00:09:43,287
But in a way I'm almost glad
I didn't make it my first try.

265
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:45,241
You know, I've really
learned a lot

266
00:09:45,242 --> 00:09:46,327
about myself over
the last couple months.

267
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:50,280
I feel like I have a-a newfound
resilience and focus.

268
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:52,268
I could really use some of that right now.
My dance teacher,

269
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:54,267
she just won't let up on me.

270
00:09:54,268 --> 00:09:56,276
The other day, she told me
I wasn't sexy enough.

271
00:09:56,277 --> 00:09:58,331
Maybe you shouldn't wear
a bra to your next class.

272
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:01,267
And take all of the attention
away from the Ms. Cassie July?

273
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,242
She'd flip.

274
00:10:03,243 --> 00:10:04,245
I can't stand her.

275
00:10:04,246 --> 00:10:05,356
Cassie July is
your dance teacher?

276
00:10:05,357 --> 00:10:07,242
As in, <i>the </i>Cassie July,

277
00:10:07,243 --> 00:10:08,295
aka Crazy July,

278
00:10:08,296 --> 00:10:10,318
aka the biggest train wreck
in Broadway history?

279
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,302
- What?
- You don't know her story?

280
00:10:12,303 --> 00:10:14,318
<i>Cassie July was the "It" girl
ten years ago.</i>

281
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:17,259
<i>She scored the coveted role
of temptress Lola</i>

282
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,760
in a high-profile revival
of <i>Damn Yankees.</i>

283
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:22,289
Then, during the first preview
of the out-of-town tryout,

284
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,310
Stop... stop. Stop the music!

285
00:10:26,235 --> 00:10:28,280
Whose cell phone is that?

286
00:10:28,281 --> 00:10:30,322
I'm not going on until
this rude person leaves.

287
00:10:30,323 --> 00:10:33,310
This performance is over
until you leave!

288
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:36,246
All right.

289
00:10:36,247 --> 00:10:38,239
Come here, old man.

290
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:42,276
You want it?
You want your phone?

291
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:43,317
Yeah!

292
00:10:43,318 --> 00:10:46,276
No wonder she's always
just so angry.

293
00:10:46,277 --> 00:10:48,288
You can't give in to her.
Not ever.

294
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:49,331
You have to keep fighting.

295
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:52,323
If she wants sexy,
give her sexy.

296
00:11:02,273 --> 00:11:04,263
So, here's the deal.

297
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,289
We're both new girls here,

298
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,289
- and new girls need to stick together.
- Cool.

299
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,238
Boys.

300
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:10,254
Who've you got your eye on?

301
00:11:10,255 --> 00:11:11,285
Jake's kind of cute.

302
00:11:11,286 --> 00:11:13,255
Oh, honey, no. Bad seed.

303
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,255
Come on. He's an artist.

304
00:11:15,256 --> 00:11:16,304
You mean pick-up artist.

305
00:11:16,305 --> 00:11:18,266
Marley, everywhere you go
in this school,

306
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:19,295
you see wreckage
of girls' hearts

307
00:11:19,296 --> 00:11:20,423
who thought
the same thing as you.

308
00:11:20,424 --> 00:11:23,267
And he's only been
in this school for two weeks!

309
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:25,264
He's even been known
to troll the girls' gym class.

310
00:11:25,265 --> 00:11:26,326
Uh-uh.

311
00:11:26,327 --> 00:11:29,327
Let me be clear:
He's a womanizer.

312
00:11:32,327 --> 00:11:36,305

Hey, Brody!

373
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:01,302
- Hey!
- Hey, Rachel.

Okay.

378
00:14:09,268 --> 00:14:14,276

uh, wasn't sexy.

'Cause there aren't enough,
you know, guys in my class.

383
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:25,305
Cassie doesn't allow
upperclassmen

384
00:14:25,306 --> 00:14:27,277
to perform in her class.
She would have a fit.

Coach Sylvester's taken away
my high pony.

425
00:16:32,288 --> 00:16:33,304
If I can't have my

426
00:16:33,305 --> 00:16:35,297
high pony,
I don't want any hair at all.

427
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:36,234
No!

428
00:16:36,235 --> 00:16:38,296
Brittany S. Pierce,

429
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,310
what do you say to reports
you've gone off the rails?

430
00:16:40,311 --> 00:16:42,322
Leave me alone, JBI!

431
00:16:42,323 --> 00:16:44,304
What's going on in
your head right now?

432
00:16:44,305 --> 00:16:45,295
Leave me alone, JBI!

433
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,310
What are you thinking?

434
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:48,851
There's no comment!

435
00:16:48,852 --> 00:16:49,329
Leave me alone!

436
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,323
I'm getting this.

437
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:55,292
Should we do something?

438
00:16:55,293 --> 00:16:58,242
No, he deserves it.

439
00:16:58,243 --> 00:16:59,323
About Brittany's
downward spiral,

440
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:03,305
I think the whole singing-at-her
thing isn't really helping.

441
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:05,042
Probably what she misses most

442
00:17:05,043 --> 00:17:06,331
about Cheerios!
Is being in the spotlight.

443
00:17:06,332 --> 00:17:08,310
We should give her that.

444
00:17:10,285 --> 00:17:12,310
- Leave her alone!
- Leave Brittany alone!

445
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:17,288
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
No scootering in the hallway.

446
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:20,330
And Mr. McCarthy's physiology
class is the other direction.

447
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,288
I'm protesting that class
on religious grounds.

448
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:26,288
They make you dissect a pig,
and I'm kosher.

449
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:28,288
What about English
and algebra and gym?

450
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:29,300
I looked at your file.

451
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:31,258
Seems like you're
not attending them, either.

452
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,241
Why are you on my back?

453
00:17:32,242 --> 00:17:33,295
I'm not one of your students.

454
00:17:33,296 --> 00:17:34,310
I'm not in Glee Club.

455
00:17:34,311 --> 00:17:36,292
And that was my mistake.

456
00:17:36,293 --> 00:17:38,289
No, thanks.
I'm not looking to change.

457
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,309
Your brother was a train
wreck, worse than you.

458
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,330
But even at his worst,
he had a community.

459
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,306
He had friends.

460
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,239
I don't need friends.

461
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,281
- I almost didn't come.
- The other girls told me

462
00:17:56,282 --> 00:17:58,251
I was crazy for even bothering.

463
00:17:58,252 --> 00:17:59,300
You really think they're right?

464
00:17:59,301 --> 00:18:01,291
I think you're a guy
who got hurt.

465
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:03,314
And I think the hair and
the guitar and the jacket

466
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,276
are all walls for that.

467
00:18:05,277 --> 00:18:06,331
You think too much.

468
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:09,255
At all my other schools,
I was picked on.

469
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:12,292
I tried so hard to be what I
thought they wanted me to be.

470
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:14,251
Just made it worse.

471
00:18:14,252 --> 00:18:16,259
For the first time
at this school,

472
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:21,238
I feel like I can just... be.

473
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:22,308
Glee Club is so lame.

474
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,297
What does Shyster have you guys
singing?

475
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:27,251
It's Britney Spears week.

476
00:18:27,252 --> 00:18:31,055
Yeah, see, I prefer music
that uses actual instruments.

477
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:32,295
Well, you haven't heard
my version yet.

478
00:18:32,296 --> 00:18:33,297
What song is it?

479
00:18:34,331 --> 00:18:36,327
I know I do.

480
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:49,234

You okay?

510
00:20:59,962 --> 00:21:02,019
Yeah, just got cold up here.

511
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,983
Here.

512
00:21:29,008 --> 00:21:31,957
Kiki, why is everybody in the
glee club staring at me?

513
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,020
Because those fools are jealous.

514
00:21:33,021 --> 00:21:34,020
Who's Kiki?

515
00:21:34,021 --> 00:21:36,969
Kiki is Siri's super smart
older cousin

516
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,035
who's really jealous
of how famous Siri's gotten.

517
00:21:39,036 --> 00:21:40,972
She lives inside
this super cheap phone

518
00:21:40,973 --> 00:21:42,012
I found at the Laundromat.

519
00:21:42,013 --> 00:21:44,961
What size coffee is that?

520
00:21:44,962 --> 00:21:46,137
Kiki, what size coffee
am I drinking?

521
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,011
You're drinking a settanta;
70 ounces of espresso.

522
00:21:49,012 --> 00:21:51,011
Thank you, Kiki.
You're the only one

523
00:21:51,012 --> 00:21:53,961
that I can trust now that
Santana's too busy for me.

524
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:55,085
Brittany,
we're worried about you.

525
00:21:55,086 --> 00:21:56,960
We know how hard
it must have felt

526
00:21:56,961 --> 00:21:57,972
to get kicked off the Cheerios!

527
00:21:57,973 --> 00:21:59,951
We want to help you
get back on your feet

528
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:00,972
and start performing again.

529
00:22:00,973 --> 00:22:01,970
You should be
the lead performer

530
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:03,961
at the pep assembly on Friday.

531
00:22:03,962 --> 00:22:05,324
That's great,
but there's only one problem.

532
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:06,969
I have to lip-sync.

533
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:07,981
We don't lip-sync in Glee.

534
00:22:07,982 --> 00:22:09,964
Well, my voice is
too weak to sing live.

535
00:22:09,965 --> 00:22:12,037
I've been up every night this
week yelling at the shrubs

536
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:14,969
in my yard that have been
making fun of me.

537
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,024
This sounds
like a terrible idea.

538
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:17,986
We'll record
the song in advance.

539
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:19,962
I'll choreograph an
amazing routine without having

540
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,998
to worry about anybody
running out of breath,

541
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:23,974
and Mr. Schuester will
never know the difference.

542
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,994
Lots of performers do this now.

543
00:22:25,995 --> 00:22:28,948
Kristen Stewart,
James Earl Jones.

544
00:22:28,949 --> 00:22:30,957
Kiki,

545
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,995
is it a good idea for me
to lip-sync at the pep assembly?

546
00:22:32,996 --> 00:22:35,952
It's not a good idea.

547
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:36,966
It's a great idea.

548
00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:38,958
Can I get you another settanta?

549
00:22:41,983 --> 00:22:43,002
You're late.

550
00:22:43,003 --> 00:22:45,978
And dressed like
a Walgreen's underwear model.

551
00:22:45,979 --> 00:22:47,994
What are you doing here, Brody?

552
00:22:47,995 --> 00:22:50,008
I asked Brody to come in and
help me with a little routine.

553
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:52,028
And you just love
helping people, don't you?

554
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:53,969
Especially the ingénues.

555
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,027
And the reason why I'm
dressed all Bob Fosse-chic

556
00:22:56,028 --> 00:22:57,985
is because I wanted
to show you that

557
00:22:57,986 --> 00:22:59,941
I do have what it
takes to be sexy.

558
00:22:59,942 --> 00:23:01,973
Sexy enough to play
Evita, Roxie and Charity.

559
00:23:01,974 --> 00:23:03,948
Show me what you've prepared.

560
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,948
Some of the dancers are
gonna help out, as well.

561
00:23:06,949 --> 00:23:09,008

So what do you think,
Ms. July?

595
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,952
Am I ready to learn the tango?

596
00:25:27,953 --> 00:25:29,943
Look, you can memorize
a routine; so what?

597
00:25:29,944 --> 00:25:30,983
Rachel was incredible.

598
00:25:30,984 --> 00:25:33,011
<i>You </i>were incredible;
She was okay.

599
00:25:33,012 --> 00:25:34,961
And that song? Garbage.

600
00:25:34,962 --> 00:25:35,960
Whose idea was that?

601
00:25:35,961 --> 00:25:37,020
You want truth? Fine.

602
00:25:37,021 --> 00:25:40,032
Maria von Trapp,
Willy Loman, Shrek.

603
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:41,956
Those are the roles
that are appropriate

604
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:42,956
for your level of sex appeal.

605
00:25:42,957 --> 00:25:44,012
You're just jealous of me.

606
00:25:44,013 --> 00:25:45,944
Of all of us.

607
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:47,133
- Rachel, don't.
- No, because we have

608
00:25:47,134 --> 00:25:49,010
Our entire careers ahead
of us and yours ended

609
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:50,001
before it even began.

610
00:25:50,002 --> 00:25:51,029
We're the future,

611
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,953
and you're just
some YouTube joke.

612
00:25:55,953 --> 00:25:57,965
You're done.

613
00:25:57,966 --> 00:26:00,032
Get out of my class.
Get out of my class!

614
00:26:00,033 --> 00:26:01,974
Out!

615
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,965
Is that all I get, Jumbo?

616
00:26:10,966 --> 00:26:12,998
Why so stingy?

617
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:14,970
They must let you eat
all those leftovers, huh?

618
00:26:14,971 --> 00:26:16,940
Quit it.
That's my mom.

619
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:18,029
Whoa! You came out of that?

620
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,961
Were you an only child

621
00:26:19,962 --> 00:26:22,011
or do you have a twin
who's still in there?

622
00:26:22,012 --> 00:26:23,991
Dude, imagine the
size of her dumps.

623
00:26:23,992 --> 00:26:25,007
Enough.

624
00:26:25,008 --> 00:26:27,941
Say you're sorry,
to both of them.

625
00:26:29,941 --> 00:26:31,965
You know what?

626
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:33,949
Screw it.

627
00:26:37,966 --> 00:26:39,973
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come on, tough guy!

628
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:41,957
You're coming with me.

629
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:43,952
In.

630
00:26:43,953 --> 00:26:44,989
This is garbage.

631
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:47,010
Those guys suck and I'm the one
being dragged to see Figgins?

632
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:48,970
I'm not taking you
to see Figgins.

633
00:26:48,971 --> 00:26:51,007
He's taking you to see me.

634
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,019
Jake Puckerman,
I'd like to introduce you

635
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,940
to your brother, Noah.

636
00:26:54,941 --> 00:26:55,970
I'll leave you two alone.

637
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:01,961
You look more like Dad
than I do.

638
00:27:01,962 --> 00:27:03,956
He never told me about you
when I was a kid,

639
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:05,029
but I do remember
my mom and dad

640
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,965
arguing about a baby
and some slut waitress.

641
00:27:07,966 --> 00:27:09,029
That would be my mom.

642
00:27:11,016 --> 00:27:13,029
Schuester called you to
come and straighten me out.

643
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,969
You're wasting your
time; I'm fine.

644
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,982
And you are not my brother.

645
00:27:17,983 --> 00:27:19,012
You think you're a badass?

646
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:20,765
Nailing a bunch of chicks,

647
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:22,031
beating up some punks
in the cafeteria?

648
00:27:22,032 --> 00:27:23,031
I'm the original badass.

649
00:27:23,032 --> 00:27:24,956
I had my first threesome
at seven,

650
00:27:24,957 --> 00:27:26,027
and once, I beat up
a police horse.

651
00:27:26,028 --> 00:27:27,989
So what, are you
gonna kick my ass

652
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,020
if I don't get myself together?

653
00:27:29,021 --> 00:27:31,948
I know what it feels like
to be scared

654
00:27:31,949 --> 00:27:35,028
that you're not important
or smart or worth anything.

655
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:36,990
We had the same dad, bro.

656
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:39,010
I know what it feels like to
spend all day trying to prove

657
00:27:39,011 --> 00:27:40,022
something to someone who's never

658
00:27:40,023 --> 00:27:42,012
going to give
two craps about you.

659
00:27:42,013 --> 00:27:45,948
I rode my motorcycle,
I played my axe,

660
00:27:45,949 --> 00:27:48,032
I banged every chick
in this place twice,

661
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,032
and you know what,
none of it made me a man.

662
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:52,024
What made me a man
was sitting here in this room,

663
00:27:52,025 --> 00:27:53,978
singing songs I hated next to

664
00:27:53,979 --> 00:27:55,947
the biggest collection of losers
you've ever seen.

665
00:27:55,948 --> 00:27:57,014
Them and Mr. Shue
made me a man.

666
00:27:57,015 --> 00:27:59,029
And if you come in here,
it'll make you one, too.

667
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,036
Think about it
for a couple days.

668
00:28:02,037 --> 00:28:04,990
I got to get back to L.A.

669
00:28:04,991 --> 00:28:06,035
I got a date with the chick

670
00:28:06,036 --> 00:28:08,029
who was third runner-up
on <i>The Bachelor.</i>

671
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,944
One thing.

672
00:28:09,945 --> 00:28:12,953
Whether you join Glee Club
or not, you're my brother.

673
00:28:24,008 --> 00:28:25,037
Quiet, please, children.

674
00:28:26,974 --> 00:28:29,028
Shh.

675
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:33,998
Welcome, children, to McKinley
High's annual fall assembly,

676
00:28:33,999 --> 00:28:38,015
where we gather
to celebrate teen pep.

677
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,978
Before we begin,
a few announcements.

678
00:28:40,979 --> 00:28:45,019
First and foremost,
I wish to address the rumor

679
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,007
that I like to be milked
like a cow

680
00:28:48,008 --> 00:28:52,973
because my breasts are filled
with delicious, wholesome milk.

681
00:28:52,974 --> 00:28:54,994
That rumor is untrue.

682
00:28:54,995 --> 00:28:58,944
And now, without further ado,
it's time for a performance

683
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,973
of music to be enjoyed by all.

684
00:29:00,974 --> 00:29:03,965
Brittany, shouldn't you
be stretching or warming up

685
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:04,994
or something?

686
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:06,006
Do you need a baby wipe?

687
00:29:06,007 --> 00:29:07,233
You have Cheeto hands
and Cheeto mouth.

688
00:29:07,234 --> 00:29:08,966
I'm fine, thank you.

689
00:29:09,995 --> 00:29:11,023
It is my honor

690
00:29:11,024 --> 00:29:13,033
to introduce McKinley High's
New Directions!

691
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:18,958
It's Britney, bitch.

711
00:30:24,945 --> 00:30:25,987

00:30:27,037 --> 00:30:28,965

717
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,965
In the 58-year history

718
00:30:46,966 --> 00:30:48,437
of the William McKinley
High School Glee Club,

719
00:30:48,438 --> 00:30:51,952
there has never been
such a debacle!

720
00:30:51,953 --> 00:30:54,952
We do not lip-sync ever!

721
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:55,960
We're sorry, Mr. Shue.

722
00:30:55,961 --> 00:30:57,306
We were just trying
to help Brittany out...

723
00:30:57,307 --> 00:30:58,322
Lip-syncing is the equivalent of

724
00:30:58,323 --> 00:30:59,960
blood doping
in professional sports!

725
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:01,939
Every gain we've made
in the last three years

726
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,003
has been wiped out.

727
00:31:03,004 --> 00:31:05,994
And I'm not just talking about
our reputation here at McKinley.

728
00:31:05,995 --> 00:31:08,948
If the National Show Choir Board
of Review gets wind of this,

729
00:31:08,949 --> 00:31:11,002
we could be barred
from competing.

730
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:13,973
What do you have to say
for yourself, Brittany?

731
00:31:13,974 --> 00:31:15,033
To quote the legend herself,

732
00:31:15,034 --> 00:31:17,952
"If I met me,
I would say a quick hello

733
00:31:17,953 --> 00:31:19,941
and then think
I was a really nice girl."

734
00:31:20,941 --> 00:31:22,001
And I resign from Glee Club,

735
00:31:22,002 --> 00:31:23,020
effective immediately.

736
00:31:36,003 --> 00:31:38,969
I'm working.

737
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,939
I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

738
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,033
All those things that I said to
you, they were completely wrong

739
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,994
and-and out of line.

740
00:31:44,995 --> 00:31:47,003
I felt like you were
picking on me for no reason.

741
00:31:47,004 --> 00:31:50,998
Stop... talking.

742
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:54,007
Look...

743
00:31:54,008 --> 00:31:58,944
you lost it and you lashed out,
same as I did ten years ago.

744
00:31:58,945 --> 00:32:00,965
Except, all it took
for you to snap

745
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:04,994
was a little honest feedback
in... excuse me... dance class.

746
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:06,233
And you expect
to make it on Broadway?

747
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:11,994
Where all there is
is scrutiny and judgment?

748
00:32:11,995 --> 00:32:13,953
- I'm really sorry...
- And what if someone taped

749
00:32:13,956 --> 00:32:16,949
Your little outburst and then
posted it on the Internet?

750
00:32:17,991 --> 00:32:20,028
You'd never get cast.

751
00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:21,998
You have one chance.

752
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:25,028
You screw it up, you're done.

753
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:27,952
You're that crazy actress.

754
00:32:27,953 --> 00:32:30,994
And why would anybody
want to work with you?

755
00:32:30,995 --> 00:32:32,952
Because you're good.

756
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:34,974
I was great.

757
00:32:36,987 --> 00:32:38,990
But it doesn't
make a difference,

758
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:42,994
because I wasn't ready
for the pressure.

759
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:45,973
Believe me, it's a whole lot
more vicious out there

760
00:32:45,974 --> 00:32:46,974
than it is in here.

761
00:32:46,975 --> 00:32:49,002
That's why I pick
on my students.

762
00:32:49,003 --> 00:32:50,991
I want them to be ready.

763
00:32:53,991 --> 00:32:56,994
Well, I-I know
that I'm not there yet.

764
00:32:56,995 --> 00:32:58,994
Not even close.

765
00:32:58,995 --> 00:33:00,957
And if I had my choice,

766
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:02,961
I wouldn't let you
back in my class.

767
00:33:02,962 --> 00:33:05,002
I don't believe
in second chances.

768
00:33:05,003 --> 00:33:06,969
I know they don't exist.

769
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,969
Unfortunately for me,

770
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,999
school policy says
you get a warning.

771
00:33:15,991 --> 00:33:17,015
So...

772
00:33:17,016 --> 00:33:20,940
So you're in, and on probation
and dance belt duty.

773
00:33:20,941 --> 00:33:23,019
Hand-washed, all of them.

774
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,998
You're dismissed, Schwimmer.

775
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:29,987
Don't forget the hamper
on your way out.

776
00:33:42,008 --> 00:33:45,999
Four, five, six, seven...

777
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:48,972
I got your note
to come meet you here.

778
00:33:48,973 --> 00:33:49,981
Thanks for drawing the map.

779
00:33:49,982 --> 00:33:51,135
Yeah, I always keep it
in my pocket

780
00:33:51,136 --> 00:33:52,970
in case someone
steals my compass.

781
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,982
Look, I know what you're up to.

782
00:33:57,983 --> 00:34:00,986
The lip-syncing, beating up
Jacob Ben Israel.

783
00:34:00,987 --> 00:34:02,958
You're intentionally
hitting rock bottom.

784
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:04,956
So I can make
a glorious comeback,

785
00:34:04,957 --> 00:34:05,977
just like Britney.

786
00:34:05,978 --> 00:34:06,989
I mean, look at her.

787
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,003
She got paid $14 million
to be on <i>X Factor.</i>

788
00:34:09,004 --> 00:34:11,007
She looks great.

789
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:13,969
She has an amazing perfume
you can smell from miles away.

790
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,990
No matter what happened to her,
she just came back stronger.

791
00:34:16,991 --> 00:34:19,015
Right. Consider
this the last stop

792
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:22,028
on the <i>Train Wreck Express...
</i>an intervention.

793
00:34:22,029 --> 00:34:24,023
Thank you.

794
00:34:24,024 --> 00:34:26,957
I'm so ready to come back.

795
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:28,978
I'm just so sad
that everybody's so mad at me.

796
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:31,029
I just think they didn't
understand what you were up to.

797
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,990
Yeah.

798
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:35,994
But you did.

799
00:34:35,995 --> 00:34:37,998
I think we just think the same.

800
00:34:37,999 --> 00:34:39,987
Yeah, it's probably
because we're both blonde.

801
00:34:39,988 --> 00:34:41,023
You okay?

802
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,990
You still seem kind of bummed.

803
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:44,015
I don't know.

804
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:46,002
Santana would have understood.

805
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:47,964
And then she would have
used mean words

806
00:34:47,965 --> 00:34:49,006
against anyone
who got down on me.

807
00:34:49,007 --> 00:34:50,014
You miss her, huh?

808
00:34:50,015 --> 00:34:51,991
I just miss, like,
the little things,

809
00:34:51,992 --> 00:34:54,007
like her laugh and the smell
of her armpits.

810
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,940
Yes, we had
interesting lady sex,

811
00:34:55,941 --> 00:34:57,961
but she was also my best friend.

812
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:00,003
Well, now you have a new
friend, and he's blond.

813
00:35:01,987 --> 00:35:03,953
I'm talking about me.

814
00:35:04,966 --> 00:35:05,993
Now you just got to figure out

815
00:35:05,994 --> 00:35:07,991
a way to get back
on the Cheerios!

816
00:35:07,992 --> 00:35:10,033
It's all part of the comeback.

817
00:35:15,024 --> 00:35:17,948
I am here to inform you
of your legal requirement

818
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,003
to restore my high pony
and put me back on the Cheerios!

819
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:23,957
I beg your pardon?

820
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:25,601
I studied the McKinley High
Student Council Charter,

821
00:35:25,602 --> 00:35:26,979
and it says that
the senior class president

822
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,007
continues his term
until he or she graduates,

823
00:35:29,008 --> 00:35:30,957
which... I never graduated,

824
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:32,949
so, technically,
I'm still president.

825
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:36,007
I drafted an executive order
demanding

826
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,991
that Brittany S. Pierce
be reinstated

827
00:35:37,992 --> 00:35:40,978
as a member in good standing
of the McKinley High Cheerios!

828
00:35:40,979 --> 00:35:43,016
Brittany, take a seat.

829
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:49,028
This is clearly
the plan of an idiot.

830
00:35:49,029 --> 00:35:51,007
But a plan nonetheless,

831
00:35:51,008 --> 00:35:53,998
and one that required the
barest modicum of human logic

832
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:55,991
which, frankly,
I thought was beyond you.

833
00:35:55,992 --> 00:35:58,023
If you want to be back
on the Cheerios!,

834
00:35:58,024 --> 00:36:00,965
I want you to graduate
by the end of the year.

835
00:36:00,966 --> 00:36:02,343
And that means you're
going to have to turn

836
00:36:02,344 --> 00:36:03,999
- those grades around.
- I'm already working on that.

837
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,010
Mr. Schuester
eventually realized

838
00:36:05,011 --> 00:36:06,985
that my lip-syncing
was a cry for help

839
00:36:06,986 --> 00:36:08,943
and wanted to step up
and take action.

840
00:36:08,944 --> 00:36:10,016
He and Miss Pillsbury
are spending

841
00:36:10,017 --> 00:36:12,941
one afternoon a week
tutoring me.

842
00:36:13,033 --> 00:36:14,036
Barack Obama.

843
00:36:14,037 --> 00:36:15,965
Yes.

844
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:16,990
Glenn Close.

845
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:18,965
Oh, good effort, Britt.

846
00:36:18,966 --> 00:36:19,994
Baby steps.

847
00:36:19,995 --> 00:36:22,023
I got a C-minus
on my U.S. History exam,

848
00:36:22,024 --> 00:36:25,007
which the teacher bumped up
two whole letter grades

849
00:36:25,008 --> 00:36:26,999
because I wrote in English
instead of my secret language

850
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,953
I invented in middle school.

851
00:36:30,945 --> 00:36:33,008
Brittany, welcome back.

852
00:36:34,003 --> 00:36:36,966
<i>Meep-zorp flurm-gloob.</i>

853
00:36:41,979 --> 00:36:43,037
What do you think?

854
00:36:43,038 --> 00:36:46,002
Am I being too obvious?

855
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,999
He hasn't called you
because he loves you,

856
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,944
not because he's
forgotten about you.

857
00:36:50,945 --> 00:36:52,958
Your freedom is a gift
he's given you... accept it.

858
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:55,982
I know. It's just so much
freedom all at once

859
00:36:55,983 --> 00:36:58,952
that it's starting to feel
like severe loneliness.

860
00:36:58,953 --> 00:37:00,990
The only cure
to loneliness is cake.

861
00:37:00,991 --> 00:37:02,497
Cake.

862
00:37:02,498 --> 00:37:04,003
There's a great Italian
bakery down the street.

863
00:37:04,004 --> 00:37:05,122
You don't mind
going out at night?

864
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:06,672
Oh, no, it's cool.
I guess if I just,

865
00:37:06,673 --> 00:37:08,006
you know, walk around
like a crazy person

866
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:09,012
yelling at things and twitching,

867
00:37:09,013 --> 00:37:10,999
people will keep
their distance.

868
00:37:14,995 --> 00:37:16,018
Well, hello there, kind sir.

869
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:17,020
Hey. Uh, I'm Brody.

870
00:37:17,021 --> 00:37:18,020
I'm Kurt.

871
00:37:19,983 --> 00:37:21,952
Hi.

872
00:37:21,953 --> 00:37:23,969
I was just going to go
get some cake.

873
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:24,986
Uh...

874
00:37:24,987 --> 00:37:26,020
I'll leave you two alone.

875
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,011
Wow.

876
00:37:32,012 --> 00:37:34,982
This is huge.

877
00:37:34,983 --> 00:37:37,944
Too bad it took me 45 minutes
on the train to get here.

878
00:37:37,945 --> 00:37:38,974
I've lived here
for three years,

879
00:37:38,975 --> 00:37:41,940
and I didn't even know
there was a "J" train.

880
00:37:41,941 --> 00:37:42,949
Wait, you took the train

881
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,947
for 45 minutes just
to come and see me?

882
00:37:44,948 --> 00:37:47,029
Yep. Sandwiched between
some guy who said he was Jesus

883
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:50,007
and two German tourists
who were very lost.

884
00:37:50,008 --> 00:37:53,036
But I came here
to give you this orchid.

885
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:55,036
Apparently, it's good luck
in a new place.

886
00:37:55,037 --> 00:37:57,029
And they're kind of sexy...
for a plant.

887
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,948
Thank you.

888
00:37:59,949 --> 00:38:01,961
Oh, and I, uh... I wanted
to tell you something

889
00:38:01,962 --> 00:38:04,965
that didn't feel
appropriate over text.

890
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:06,023
What?

891
00:38:06,024 --> 00:38:09,990
That I... I really liked
dancing with you.

892
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:12,015
And I think that you...

893
00:38:12,016 --> 00:38:14,945
I think that you're
really sexy.

894
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:17,002
And...

895
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,032
Oh...

896
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:20,990
I can't.

897
00:38:20,991 --> 00:38:24,036
I think you are amazing
and-and-and...

898
00:38:24,037 --> 00:38:26,944
very, very, very sexy.

899
00:38:26,945 --> 00:38:27,990
I just...

900
00:38:27,991 --> 00:38:29,957
You're still in love

901
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:31,952
with your boyfriend.

902
00:38:31,953 --> 00:38:34,965
Here's the thing... I...
I will respect your boundaries,

903
00:38:34,966 --> 00:38:38,952
but just know that
when we're together,

904
00:38:38,953 --> 00:38:40,953
whatever we're talking about,
whatever we're doing,

905
00:38:40,954 --> 00:38:42,958
I'm thinking of kissing you.

906
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:46,962
Enjoy the orchid.

907
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,990
Uh, you think I could sit
next to you in Glee Club?

908
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:03,944
I don't know anybody else.

909
00:39:03,945 --> 00:39:04,991
So you're going to join?

910
00:39:04,992 --> 00:39:08,965
I didn't realize I had that
powerful of an effect on you.

911
00:39:08,966 --> 00:39:09,990
It wasn't you.

912
00:39:09,991 --> 00:39:11,944
Well, it-it helped.

913
00:39:11,945 --> 00:39:13,952
I just...
I don't know.

914
00:39:13,953 --> 00:39:15,961
I get these feelings sometimes
to punch someone

915
00:39:15,962 --> 00:39:17,958
or steal a cop car
or kiss someone,

916
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:20,990
and I hear Glee Club
might help them go away.

917
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,011
Even though it
totally sucks balls.

918
00:39:23,012 --> 00:39:26,023
I promise, it's not that bad.

919
00:39:26,024 --> 00:39:29,033
Just stick with me, and I'll
help you get through it.

920
00:39:33,953 --> 00:39:36,007
It's nice to have
a friend looking out for me.

921
00:39:36,008 --> 00:39:38,948
Well, I owe you for
what you did for my mom.

922
00:39:38,949 --> 00:39:43,023
Oh, I just realized I'm
still wearing your jacket.

923
00:39:43,024 --> 00:39:44,952
Looks pretty good on you.

924
00:39:44,953 --> 00:39:45,968
I bet it looks better on me.

925
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:47,033
We're dating now.

926
00:39:47,034 --> 00:39:49,970
Didn't Jake tell you?

927
00:39:50,991 --> 00:39:52,953
No, he didn't.

928
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,947
Well, uh, it's not
really my style

929
00:39:55,948 --> 00:39:57,003
to put a label on things.

930
00:39:57,004 --> 00:39:58,962
You two make a great couple.

931
00:40:02,949 --> 00:40:04,983
Bye.

932
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,019
All right.
Okay, let's give

933
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:32,007
a big New Directions!
Welcome to Jake Puckerman.

934
00:40:32,008 --> 00:40:33,985
Hey, dude. Uh, me and your bro
were practically best friends.

935
00:40:33,986 --> 00:40:35,991
Is it weird that I know him
a lot better than you?

936
00:40:35,992 --> 00:40:37,023
Welcome, bro.

937
00:40:37,024 --> 00:40:39,953
God made you, and God
doesn't make mistakes.

938
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:57,003
- Mr. Schuester.
- Yeah, Marley.

939
00:40:57,006 --> 00:40:59,998
If it's all right, I'd like
to sing one last Britney song.

940
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,647
Did that come out this morning?
'Cause we've

941
00:41:01,648 --> 00:41:02,949
scraped the bottom
of that Britney barrel.

942
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:03,986
