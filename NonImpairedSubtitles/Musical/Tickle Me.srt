(SINGING <i>(IT'S A) LONG LONEL YHIGHWA Y)</i>

2
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:54,682
Zuni Wells.

3
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:06,153
- Expecting somebody?
- Yeah, it looks like I've been stood up.

4
00:03:06,231 --> 00:03:07,755
Is it always this busy?

5
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:11,325
It's a swingin' town, that's for sure.
Well, good luck, cowboy.

6
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:13,866
Thank you. I'm gonna need it.

7
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,447
STURDIVANT: Hassayampa Creek.
That's where the Sheriff went.

8
00:03:30,522 --> 00:03:31,682
Way up in the high country.

9
00:03:31,757 --> 00:03:34,055
He says the trout weigh
as much as 10 or 12 pounds.

10
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:37,152
They sure do. I've seen them.
How long is he going to be gone?

11
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:39,288
Till he gets his fill of fishing.

12
00:03:39,364 --> 00:03:40,456
- Howdy.
- Hi.

13
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:42,397
- See you later, Jim.
- Sheriff.

14
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:44,094
What can I do for you?

15
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:46,501
I'm looking for a Pete Bullman.
He's supposed to meet me here.

16
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:48,095
Pete? He's gone.

17
00:03:48,173 --> 00:03:51,006
Had a run-in with the foreman
at the Bar-B and he quit.

18
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:53,670
Oh, great. He was gonna get me a job.

19
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:57,646
- Rodeo, huh?
- Yeah.

20
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,648
- Say, you're Lonnie Beale.
- Yeah.

21
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,213
Sure, Lonnie Beale. I saw you
in the bull riding event, up at Prescott.

22
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,689
I hear you got hurt.

23
00:04:06,758 --> 00:04:09,488
Yeah. One of the bulls decided
that I was sitting on him too long,

24
00:04:09,561 --> 00:04:11,586
so he decided to sit on me.

25
00:04:11,663 --> 00:04:15,099
Well, you'll probably be all right
by the time the rodeo season starts.

26
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:18,364
Yeah, I'll be all right.
There's only one problem.

27
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,831
How am I going to eat till then?

28
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:22,203
Well...

29
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:24,365
Don't tell me. I know.

30
00:06:43,081 --> 00:06:44,343
Wow!

31
00:06:47,152 --> 00:06:48,642
(ALL LAUGHING)

32
00:06:49,054 --> 00:06:51,284
I loved it.

33
00:06:51,356 --> 00:06:54,519
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Don't "Thank you, ma'am" me.

34
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,954
You cute thing, you.

35
00:06:58,296 --> 00:07:00,264
Let go, you. That's my girl.

36
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:02,197
He doesn't want to let go.

37
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:04,064
- I said let go.
- I'm not holding her.

38
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:07,571
Take it easy, partner.
There's enough for both of you.

39
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:11,036
Is that so?

40
00:07:13,078 --> 00:07:14,705
There's no reason for a fight.

41
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:30,055
JIM: Break it up, there!

42
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:39,096
Break it up! Break it up, now!

43
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,345
I'll deal with you later.

44
00:07:58,923 --> 00:08:01,153
He handles himself very well.

45
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:04,227
I could've finished that guy off
in half the time.

46
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:08,129
Yes, dear, I know.
I was there the last time you lost a fight.

47
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:10,499
Excuse me.

48
00:08:10,902 --> 00:08:12,733
Good show, Mr. Beale.

49
00:08:13,471 --> 00:08:15,234
That happens every once in a while.

50
00:08:15,306 --> 00:08:18,002
- I haven't seen you here before.
- My first night.

51
00:08:18,076 --> 00:08:21,739
If that character turns out to be
a good customer, it'll be my last.

52
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:23,781
It'd be a shame if you lost your job.

53
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:24,872
It's a living.

54
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:27,144
- My name's Vera Radford.
- How do you do?

55
00:08:27,218 --> 00:08:29,482
- How'd you like to work for me?
- Doing what?

56
00:08:29,554 --> 00:08:31,545
I own the Circle-Z ranch.

57
00:08:33,058 --> 00:08:35,549
Any objections to working for a woman?

58
00:08:38,163 --> 00:08:41,155
No objections.
I never had a lady boss before.

59
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,863
Well, you have now.

60
00:08:43,935 --> 00:08:47,132
I'll pick you up at 10:30 tomorrow
morning in front of the Union Bank.

61
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:51,005
Just a minute, Miss Radford.
I like to make my own decisions.

62
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:53,673
By all means, Mr. Beale.

63
00:08:59,284 --> 00:09:02,151
So this is the only life
I've ever known, Miss Radford.

64
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,621
You see, my uncle raised me,
had me in a saddle before I could walk.

65
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,817
I've been riding ever since.

66
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:13,022
I can always rely on my instinct, Lonnie.
I knew you were the right man for the job.

67
00:09:40,892 --> 00:09:41,881
I...

68
00:09:42,427 --> 00:09:44,418
I thought I was going to work
on your ranch, ma'am.

69
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:49,763
This is my ranch. A guest ranch
for actresses, models, career women.

70
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:51,631
We help the girls get in shape.

71
00:09:55,006 --> 00:09:57,270
Well, you done a real good job.

72
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,571
- Brad.
- Yes, Miss Radford?

73
00:10:01,646 --> 00:10:03,238
Will you come here for a minute, please?

74
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:13,350
Brad Bentley, our swimming instructor.

75
00:10:13,424 --> 00:10:15,483
Lonnie Beale.
He's gonna take care of the horses.

76
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,788
Beale.

77
00:10:18,263 --> 00:10:20,561
I understand
you're the kind of saddle tramp

78
00:10:20,632 --> 00:10:22,725
that doesn't like to stay long in one place.

79
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,267
Yeah, at least I know horses.

80
00:10:24,335 --> 00:10:27,168
And the ones with long hairs
are usually jackasses.

81
00:10:27,238 --> 00:10:30,696
Brad, maybe you better show Mr. Beale
where his quarters are.

82
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:33,175
We'll put him in 7 A with Stanley.

83
00:10:33,244 --> 00:10:34,905
Yes, Miss Radford.

84
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:36,276
This way.

85
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:40,112
Mr. Bentley, would you carry this for me,
please?

86
00:10:44,956 --> 00:10:46,753
See you later, ma'am.

87
00:10:47,859 --> 00:10:51,420
One, two, three, down.

88
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:54,556
Left, right, up.

89
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,266
One, two, three, bend.

90
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:01,697
Left, right, up.

91
00:11:01,973 --> 00:11:05,465
One, two, three, down.

92
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:22,752
Well...

93
00:11:33,838 --> 00:11:38,798
Never mind, cowboy,
just pick up your saddle and mosey along.

94
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:40,537
We got work to do.

95
00:11:48,853 --> 00:11:51,219
Did you get the message, wise guy?

96
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:53,280
Yeah, I got the message.

97
00:11:53,424 --> 00:11:55,790
Forget it. She's not interested.

98
00:11:56,094 --> 00:11:57,652
Not interested?

99
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:00,354
I don't know many girls
that are not interested.

100
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:06,097
Well, maybe not in me, or you,
but just don't kid yourself, pal.

101
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:17,575
(EX CLAIMS)

102
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:22,252
- I'm Stanley Potter.
- Lonnie Beale.

103
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,550
- Welcome to Yogurt Gulch.
- Thank you.

104
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:26,851
- You've got my brush.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

105
00:12:26,924 --> 00:12:28,323
They told me to bunk in here. Is that okay?

106
00:12:28,393 --> 00:12:29,826
That's fine. Just fine.

107
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:31,828
How come "Barney Beautiful"
helped carry your gear?

108
00:12:31,896 --> 00:12:34,091
He's a real nice fellow.
He insisted on helping.

109
00:12:34,165 --> 00:12:35,689
He should live so long.

110
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:38,133
You can take this bed
and just make yourself comfortable.

111
00:12:38,202 --> 00:12:39,464
Thank you.

112
00:12:39,537 --> 00:12:41,164
- Stanley?
- Yeah.

113
00:12:41,272 --> 00:12:43,570
Miss Radford told me the girls
are all guests on this ranch.

114
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:44,835
- Is that right?
- Guests?

115
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:46,706
They have to pay $500 a week,

116
00:12:46,778 --> 00:12:48,678
and I mean that's every week.

117
00:12:48,746 --> 00:12:52,375
You might say Circle-Z is a factory
for reconditioning girls.

118
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,111
What's wrong with the condition
they're in now?

119
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:57,484
You're looking at the after girls.
Wait till you see the before girls.

120
00:12:59,357 --> 00:13:02,087
- You follow me?
- I'm way ahead of you.

121
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:04,283
(SCREAMS)

122
00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:05,692
Watch it!

123
00:13:06,497 --> 00:13:07,486
Oh.

124
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:12,100
- It's okay, just throw it on the floor.
- Sure.

125
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,365
You see, it's all done very scientifically.

126
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:17,636
You see, we roast them, toast them,
wiggle them, jiggle them,

127
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:20,610
rend them, bend them,
and give them very little to eat.

128
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:22,737
And for that they pay 500 bucks?

129
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:26,139
Somebody does.

130
00:13:26,484 --> 00:13:31,512
They come in here measuring 40"-30"-38".
That's to use rough figures.

131
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:34,080
- That's rough?
- And when they leave a few weeks later,

132
00:13:34,158 --> 00:13:36,626
36"-38"-24".

133
00:13:36,861 --> 00:13:39,659
- Thirty-eight?
- Thirty-six...

134
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:41,990
Well, you'll see the difference.

135
00:13:43,034 --> 00:13:45,002
Yeah, I guess I will.

136
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:49,998
Stanley, let me ask you a question.

137
00:13:50,575 --> 00:13:52,202
You can call me Stan.

138
00:13:52,276 --> 00:13:53,743
Okay, Stan.

139
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:55,142
How do you keep your mind on your job

140
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:56,942
with all these beautiful girls
roaming around here?

141
00:13:57,014 --> 00:14:00,472
Well, that isn't easy, believe me.
You have to develop an attitude.

142
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:04,920
I always say to myself,
"Stan Potter, it's strictly business."

143
00:14:05,656 --> 00:14:07,954
Stan Potter... Stanley,

144
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:10,015
- do me a favor.
- Sure.

145
00:14:10,094 --> 00:14:11,857
You keep reminding me
that it's strictly business, okay?

146
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:13,419
- Yeah. Lonnie Beale?
- Yeah.

147
00:14:13,498 --> 00:14:15,398
It's strictly business.

148
00:14:28,045 --> 00:14:29,239
(WHOOPS)

149
00:14:29,414 --> 00:14:31,712
Here comes the girdle brigade.

150
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,783
Well, you gotta look
at it this way, Miss Penfield,

151
00:14:35,853 --> 00:14:39,380
a ride a day melts the fat...
I mean, the pounds away.

152
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:44,655
Yes, but I never knew anything
filled with hay could be so hard.

153
00:14:46,464 --> 00:14:48,159
Come and get it!

154
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,997
Don't goose the cook.

155
00:14:55,973 --> 00:14:57,770
Can I help you, Brad?

156
00:14:57,842 --> 00:15:00,174
Yeah, you can take this to the wolves.

157
00:15:08,186 --> 00:15:10,245
- That's all, I'm sorry.
- Thank you. Keep moving.

158

- I've been trying to tell you.

that the old man really did stash
some money out there somewhere.

Well, I hate to disappoint you,
but this is the main course.

Hi, Lonnie.

480
00:43:01,424 --> 00:43:04,882
Hi, Pam.
I've been saving this table for us all night.

481
00:43:05,628 --> 00:43:10,497
I'm sorry, Lonnie, but I've got things to do.
I'm personnel, remember.

482
00:43:10,933 --> 00:43:12,560
How about later?

483
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:20,437
- Later.
- Okay.

484
00:43:29,185 --> 00:43:33,144
Darling, if I may say so,

485
00:43:33,422 --> 00:43:37,119
I think you should be
a little bit more subtle.

486
00:43:37,193 --> 00:43:42,563
Now, yesterday, on the trail, you kept
riding up to Lonnie every five minutes.

487
00:43:42,698 --> 00:43:45,861
If you must know, I was uncomfortable.

488
00:43:46,169 --> 00:43:49,297
So I asked him to lengthen the stirrups.

489
00:43:49,672 --> 00:43:52,505
It's too bad he couldn't widen the saddle.

put a chicken on that plate,

on your plate. I saw it.
