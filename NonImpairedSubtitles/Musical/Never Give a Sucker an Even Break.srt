How are you, Chuck?

3
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,760
Hello, Gorgeous.
Oh, say, your daughter's
looking for you.

4
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,497
Oh, thanks.
I'll take the next bus.

5
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,696
OK, Gorgeous.

Oh, hello, Mother.
Who're you doubling today?

Lydia Flickham

Be careful.

00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,808
Say, I thought you were
supposed to be rehearsing.

10
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,613
I haven't even started yet.

11
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:02,450
Well, you knock them over
in that rehearsal
and I'll let you support me.

What's a kitten's stocking?

21
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,494
A sock on the puss.

22
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,498

Hi.

32
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,816
It's a lucky thing
I recognized you.

33
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,513
I thought it was that guy
coming back again.

34
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,689
I was about to
clout your brains out.

35

How about a part
in this new picture
you're gonna do?

Go away or I'll kill you.

You're alright.
You're all set.

38
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,693
Thank you, Mr. Fields.

39
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,826
How would you
like to hide the egg

40
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:01,465
and gurgitate a few
saucers of mocha java?

41
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,509
No, thanks.
I've just had breakfast.

42
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:08,377
Oh, you have, eh?
Well, call me up at
sometime at the house.

43
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,710
What time?

44
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,443
Oh, a couple o'clock.

45

Good morning, beautiful.

A ringer!

48
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,835
Got a menu?

49
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,143
Thank you. Thank you.

50
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,920
Is there any goulash
on this menu?

51
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,525
That's roast beef gravy.
Oh, it's roast beef gravy.

52
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,691
Is that steak
New York cut?

53
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,266
What about...

54
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,894
No extra charge
for the cold shower, I hope.

55
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,964
Do you think
it's too hot for pork chops?

56
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,129
Oh.

57
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:46,738
That practically eliminates
everything but ham and eggs.

58
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,381
Forgot about that.

59
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,683
No ham?

60
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,687
Two fomented eggs in a glass.

61
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,194
Cup.

62
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,428
Yes. Cup.

63
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,363
And some whole wheat...

64
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,661
White.

65
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,601
Some white bread, yes.

66
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,940
And a... Get away from there.

67
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:19,004
And a cup of
mocha java with cream.

68
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,409
Milk.

69
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,710
Milk. Yes, that's fine.

70
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,545
Two in the water, easy!

71

Go away. Go away.
Get away. Go on.

it's something else.

I didn't squawk
about the steak, dear.

Thirty-five cents.

scrutinize it carefully

at the studio told me.

not to tell you.

132
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,443

Don't be so free
with your hands.

trying to guess your weight.

called that for two days.

high blood pressure for years.

138

and I had to give it up.

139
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,443
Very comical.

Thank you, Mrs. Pastromi.

319
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,093
You're welcome.

320
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:32,963
Then you go off to the local
barber shop and get shaved

321
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:37,532
and play the rest of
the scene and the picture

322
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,271
with an absolutely clean face.

323
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:48,215
Oh, well, alright.
We can cut that out.

324
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,413
If you don't mind, Mr. Fields,
I'll read it myself.

325
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:54,550
I get a better feel,
capture the mood and the tempo
better that way, you see.

326
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,287
It's in English, isn't it?

327
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:01,429
"A long shot of
streamlined plane with
open-air, rear observation..."

328
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,760
"With open-air,
rear observation compartment.

329
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,828
"In the plane is the
handsome hero, Bill Fields

330
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:12,133
"and his little niece,
Gloria Jean,

331
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,110
"who are winging their way
toward the Russian village

332
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,579
<i>"in the strange
and distant land of..."

333
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:18,473
Are you happy?

334
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,142
You bet I am, Uncle.

335
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,220
Must be a Shriners'
convention in town.

336
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,188
Or maybe
he's a cigarette salesman.

337
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,423
I beg your pardon.

338
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,297
That's quite alright.

339
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,800
It doesn't matter.

340
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:45,402
I hope he hasn't brought his
polo ponies on board with him.

341
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:48,207
They'll be pawing all night
and keep us awake.

342
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,382
Good night, Uncle.
Good night, dear.

343
00:25:56,454 --> 00:26:00,083
Now don't you worry.
I'll be right over here in
the upper berth next to you.

344
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:01,386
Alright.

345
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,889
What's the matter,
did you sprain your ankle?

346
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,829
No, no, no, a dog bit me.

347
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:11,892
Yeah, I was playing croquet
and I dropped my mallet.

348
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:15,838
And a little dachshund
ran straight out

349
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,967
and grabbed me by the fetlock.

350
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:23,879
Rather fortunate it wasrt
a Newfoundland dog
that bit you.

351
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,349
Yes, rather.
I suppose so.

352
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,683
I'm sleeping here somewhere,
but I don't quite know where.

353
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:34,054
Well, there's no other place
to sleep if you don't sleep
in the plane here.

354
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,615
That's right.

355
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:38,390
No hotels around anywhere.

356
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:45,926
Here you are, Mr. Fields.

357
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,596
Well, thank you.

358
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,704
Where are you supposed
to sleep, in that
little hammock up there?

359
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:51,833
Yes, sir.

360
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:53,839
Good night, Uncle Bill.

361
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,106
Good night, dear.

362
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:58,011
I'll be right
across the way, dear.

363
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:01,951
I'll be up here all alone,
except that fly.
Get out of there.

364
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,690
Get the other leg, please.
Thanks.

365
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,632
I use both of them, usually.

366
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:21,830
There's some answers
in my cap again.

367
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,020
Time to get up, sir.
We're landing shortly.

368
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,185
Oh!

369
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,453
Oh!

370
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,085
Are you airsick?

371
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,255
No, dear.

372
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,596
Somebody put too many olives
in my martinis, last night.

373
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,260
Shall I get you a Bromo?

374
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,361
No, I couldn't
stand the noise.

375
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,329
Time to get up, little lady.

376
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,739
FIELDS: Get up, dear.

377
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:58,833
OK.

378
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,710
We're landing
in a few minutes... Half hour.

379
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,647
2 or 3... What time did
she say we were landing?

380
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,748
Maybe we're not going to land.
Go back to sleep again.

Clouds.

There's enough material there

Oh, that's a surprise to me.

Yeah, I should, too.

Ohh!

402
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,404
Steady on, old man, steady on.

403
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:39,006
I have a big nose,
have I, eh?

404
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:42,342
You, me on the head hitted?

405
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:46,844
Say boys, let me out of this
thing. I'm neutral. Go ahead.

406
00:29:56,294 --> 00:30:00,560
Forgot my soap, forgot my
razor, I forgot everything.

407
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,324
Pardon me.

408
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,134
No wonder they call this
a giant airliner.

409
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:17,107
Do you travel as one person, or
d'you get a party rate of 10?

410
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,514
OK, don't answer.

411
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,450
Here. Oh, here you are.
Here.

412
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,191
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

413
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,255
I didn't sleep well last night.

414
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,699
- You didn't?
I'm troubled with insomnia.

415
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,669
Oh, insomnia.

416
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,967
Well, I know a good
cure for it.
- Yeah?

417
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,234
Get plenty of sleep.

418
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,570
Sleep, huh?

419
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,473
That's what
the doctor told me.

420
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,736
Toothbrush.

421
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:56,386
At least you're not on the plane
in the morning when I get off.

422
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,147
Excuse me.

423
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,652
Always brush them down
like that.
- Brush them down.

424
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:04,319
Never across like that.
- No, no, no, no.

425
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:07,558
That's what it says in the
latest etiquette book. Yeah.

426
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,329
Oh, I got more cleaner.
I need more.

427
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:32,517
Must have just
gone through a cloud.

428
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,789
That's a hot one.

429
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:42,594
You were shaving me
and I'm shaving you.

430
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:49,231
Are you ready, dear?

431
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,399
Be ready in a jiffy.

432
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,476
A jiffy? Oh, OK.

433
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:55,910
Well, I'll meet you
on the back platform, dear.

434
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,969
Alright.

435
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,106
OK, dear.

436
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:00,911
Hello, there.

437
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,145
Oh, miss.

438
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:17,024
What inclement weather!

439
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,340
What are you drinking,
Uncle Bill?

440
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:32,611
Oh, just a little ginger ale,
dear. Pull up a chair there.

441
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:41,053
You know, Uncle Bill,
I've been thinking.
Why didn't you ever marry?

442
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,390
I was in love with
a beautiful blonde once, dear.

443
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:48,660
Drove me to drink.
That's the one thing
I'm indebted to her for.

444
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,460
Go and pack your little
portmanteau, will you, dear?

445
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:53,902
Alright.

446
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:05,938
Uncle Bill!

447
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,313
Uncle Bill!

448
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,644
Aahh!

449
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,594
Oh, boy.

450
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:05,175
Why didn't I think
of that parachute?
Well, there she goes.

451
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,014
What a bump.
And how fortunate...

452
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,142
How do you do?

453
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,244
Do you live here?

454
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:15,546
What are you?

455
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,110
I'm an American citizen.

456
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,345
An American eagle?

457
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:23,019
No, it's the first time
I've ever been up
in a plane in my life.

458
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:25,688
I'm just a man.

459
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,390
Man?

460
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,660
I never heard
that word before.

461
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,894
You didn't?

462
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,333
Are you really a man?

463
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,428
Well, I've been called
other things.

464
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,441
I've never seen one before
in all my life.

465
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,034
You never have, eh?

466
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:45,315
Mother brought me
to the nest here when
I was only three months old.

467
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:48,750
Oh, she did, eh?
And you've never seen a man?

468
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,818
Do you ever play
the game of squidgilum?

469
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:56,986
No. The only game
I've ever played is bean bag.

470
00:34:57,061 --> 00:35:01,498
Bean bag?
Oh, it's very good. Becomes
very exciting at times.

471
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:05,764
I saw the championship
played in Paris.
Many people were killed.

472
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,269
Pull up a chair.

473
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,975
Get a little closer here.
You're too far away.

474
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:19,380
Wait a minute.
Maybe I'm the one.

475
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,678
Now, you put your hands
on your head that way.

476
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:30,851
That's it.
Now, close your eyes
and pucker your lips a bit.

477
00:35:58,556 --> 00:35:59,989
Shall we play another rubber?

478
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,091
Why, Mother.

479
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,150
Grr!

480
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,468
Romulus and Remus.

481
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,303
What are you doing here?

482
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:14,929
Mother, this is a man.

483
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,373
He fell out of an airplane
and brought a wonderful
new game to us.

484
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,034
It's called squidgilum.

485
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,102
You pull two chairs together.

486
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,648
Place your hands on your head
in this fashion.

487
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:28,116
Then you close your eyes,
and then you both
press your lips together.

488
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,946
I'll try it with him.

489
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,552
Mother knows best.

490
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,520
Close your eyes, Mother.

491
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,783
Men, men, they're all alike.

492
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,017
They'll deceive you
as your father did me.

493
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,925
He kissed a chorus girl
and when I found it out,
he said,

494
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:14,726
"Oh, I was drunk
and didn't know
what I was doing."

495
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,931
Do you think he drinks?

496
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:21,199
He didn't get that nose
from playing Ping-Pong.

497
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:29,606
What a catastrophe.

498
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:34,581
Just a minute, Mr. Fields.
There is a limit
to everything.

499
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:37,815
This script is an insult to
a man's intelligence, even mine.

500
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,948
You drop from a plane,
10,000 feet in the air,

501
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:43,459
and you land on a divan
without a scratch.

502
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:45,085
You play post office
with a beautiful blonde,

503
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,630
and then you throw yourself
over a cliff in a basket.

504
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:50,758
It's impossible,
inconceivable,
incomprehensible.

505
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:53,497
And besides that,
it's no good.

506
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,899
And as for the continuity,
it's terrible.

507
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:02,503
And for my own information,
off the record, what's
happened to Gloria Jean?

508
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,242
Where has she been
all this time?

509
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:08,513
Oh. Oh, I see. Here, she is.

510
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:12,352
"Poor little Gloria

513
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,733
Hello? Uncle Bill!

Where are you? What?

515
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,306
Yes. Yes, I'll be right over.

516
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,177
How do you get to
the Russian village?

517
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,076
I'll take care of it.

518
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,543
I fell out of an airplane

519
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:47,022
whilst trying to retrieve
a bottle of golden nectar

520
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:51,089
and landed on
the pinnacle of yonder rock,

521
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:56,322
where is domiciled
a vision of loveliness,
if ever there was one,

522
00:38:56,934 --> 00:39:00,529
and her mother, a buzzard,
if ever there was one.

523
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:03,903
If that girl is
as beautiful as you say,
I'll scale the wall tomorrow.

524
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:05,271
I've heard about them.

525
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,369
They say the old buzzard's
husband walked out on her
before the girl was born.

526
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:11,472
And the buzzard vowed that
the daughter would never see
or hear the name "man"

527
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:12,573
as long as she lived.

528
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,777
They also say the old gal
has a bank roll so big,

529
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,547
a greyhound
couldn't leap over it.

530
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,780
Yeah?

531
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:24,252
Well, she seems
to have a kind heart, too.

532
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:30,192
Maybe you could induce her
to come down and talk turkey

533
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:34,499
to one that really loves her
and has her interest at heart.

534
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,672
She seemed like
an awfully nice woman to me,

535
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,703
now that
I come to think of it.

on our head thus.

Then we close our eyes.

00:49:57,694 --> 00:50:00,925
Are you sure you've lived here
since you were three months old?

632
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:03,730
Squidge.

633
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:11,165
Well, who is...
Who are you?

634
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:12,902
Mrs. Hemogloben.

635
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:15,774
- Who?
-Mrs. Hemogloben.

636
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,541
Give me another transfusion.

637
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,781
Hemo... Homoglo...

638
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,285
Oh, you're not the dame
that has all that mon...

639
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,980
I mean,
you're the beautiful lady

640
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,955
that has the house
on top of the hill.

641
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:30,425
Oh, all of my life, I've been
craving love of this kind.

642
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:32,553
- Oh!
- Oh, love.

643
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:36,864
I don't think you can get
that cricket bat in here.

644
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:38,195
Yeah, sure.

645
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,198
What kind of a bird
is that, Uncle Bill?

646
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:42,999
Oh, it's a philliloo bird,
dear.

647
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:44,267
Flies backwards.

648
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:45,467
Flies backwards?

649
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,476
Yes, it lives in the desert.

650
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:50,936
Flies backwards to keep
the sand out of its eyes.

651
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:59,418
I wonder where the contraption
is that starts this thing.

652
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:04,023
Did it hurt you, Uncle?

653
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:11,059
No, how could a rock dropping
from 1,000 feet hurt your head?

654
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:22,710
Ah, here we go!

655
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:28,183
You can see all over
the country, can't you?

656
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,860
Oh, for a Maxwell parachute.

657
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,400
What's
a Maxwell parachute?

658
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:48,802
Good until the last drop,
dear. Here we go again.

659
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:13,590
Ready, children?

660
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,778
Now wait, folks.

661
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:40,982
My dear Mrs. Hemogloben,

662
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,291
a token of my love and esteem.

663
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:52,193
What a voracious appetite
that little bird had. I... Oh.

664
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:53,861
-Here they are.
- Thank you.

665
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:55,029
Thank you.

666
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:58,704
Fly away.

667
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:00,440
He'll stay around... May I?

668
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,602
Oh, please do.

669
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:03,138
Thank you.

670
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,943
Once when I...

671
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,543
Oh, dear. Are you hurt?

672
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,215
I can't tell yet.

673
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:14,150
-Oh, my!
- Drat!

674
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:17,687
Pardon me.
May I remove the basket?

675
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:19,956
-Yes, please do.
- Thank you.

676
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:34,305
-Good gracious!
- Yes.

677
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:38,143
Oh, my!
Oh, I'm so sorry.

678
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,979
It's quite alright,
quite alright.

679
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,518
Can you do
anything with it?

680
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:43,848
I think I can do
something with it.

681
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,717
I don't know what yet.

682
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,254
Tsk, tsk.

683
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:48,950
My Uncle Bill.

684
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:51,920
But I still love him.

685
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,096
My dear Mrs. Hemogloben,

686
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:58,794
when I first saw you I was so
enamored with your beauty...

687
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:01,200
Oh, Mr. Fields.

688
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:03,330
...I ran to the basket,
jumped in,

689
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,735
went down to the city and
bought myself a wedding outfit.

690
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:14,781
And now I'm here to lay
my heart at your feet.

691
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:18,013
You are so full of romance.

692
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,216
Every night, every night.
What's the matter
with this thing?

693
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:22,918
Sit down on it again,
will you, so I can get up.

694
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:24,085
Let me help you.

695
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:28,223
Oh, dear, everything
seems to be going wrong.

696
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:29,629
Yes, it does.

697
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,189
Mother!

698
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:34,829
Mother, Mr. Carson and I are gonna
be married and right away, too.

699
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:37,771
Mr. Fields brought up the owner
of the cantina, Mr. Clines.

700
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:40,332
He's sheriff, magistrate
and mayor of the village.

701
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,310
He's going to
marry us immediately.

702
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:46,070
Why not make it
a double-header?
It's Saturday afternoon,

703
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:47,810
and I haven't anything to do.

704
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:50,614
Mr. Fields,
this is so sudden.

705
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:53,387
I'm so happy.

706
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,855
And so am I.

707
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:58,985
Hello there!

708
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,562
My dream girl!

709
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:08,267
Leon!

710
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:13,232
My <i>bon ami!

711
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:17,112
Have you seen our... My...

712
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,148
Her hanging swimming pool?

713
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:20,614
Hanging swimming...
No.

714
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:23,915
Say, dear, why don't I show
him the hanging swimming pool?

715
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,090
Hanging swimming pool?
Where is this hanging swimming...

716
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,654
Why, right here. Get up on there,
you can see it a little better.

717
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:39,099
It's gonna be better?
Oh, yeah.

718
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,158
Yeah!

719
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:44,999
Help! Help! Help!

720
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:52,180
(SPLASH)

721
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:59,979
Suffering sciatica!

722
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:02,891
Last time
it was pink elephants.

723
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,017
(EXPLOSION)

724
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,528
Oh, you're back.
- Yeah.

725
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:11,662
The poor chap
just had a mishap.

726
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:12,793
Oh, that's too bad.

727
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,234
Slipped over the parapet.

728
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:15,328
Oh, my!

729
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,935
Shall we proceed
with the ceremony?

730
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:19,770
Just as you say.

731
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:22,710
Thank you, Mrs. Hemogloben.

732
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,474
May I call you Daisy?

733
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,242
Oh, I wish you would.

734
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,284
- Uncle Bill.
- Yes, dear?

735
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:29,443
May I see you a minute?

736
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:31,851
Certainly. Excuse me,
Mrs. Hemogloben.

737
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:33,149
Certainly.

738
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,426
What is it?

739
00:56:46,468 --> 00:56:49,026
Uncle Bill, I don't
want you to get married.

740
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:54,770
You listen to me, missy.
Don't you want to live
in this beautiful nest?

741
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:57,106
Have a personal maid?
- No.

742
00:56:57,814 --> 00:57:02,615
Wear diaphanous gowns?
And eat regularly?

743
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:05,119
I just want to be with you.

744
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:06,585
You'll be with me.

745
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:08,214
But she'll be with us.

746
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:15,355
I never thought of that.

747
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:32,004
We're falling 2,000 feet!

748
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:33,571
It's alright, dear.

749
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:39,077
Don't start worrying
until we get down to 1,999!

750
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:42,116
It's the last foot
that's dangerous.

751
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:47,891
That's all! That's enough!
That's too much!

752
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:50,861
Airplanes with sun decks!

753
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:54,028
Russian villages in the sky!

754
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:56,663
Gorillas playing post office!

755
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:59,674
Cows, sheep, goat's milk!

756
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:05,113
I'm going and when I get back
you'd better not be here.

757
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:07,149
I don't care
where you go, just go!

758
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:10,209
Go, go get a drink!
Get two drinks!
Get a dozen drinks!

759
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,893
Gimme a drink, I'm dying.

760
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:20,259
What'll it be?

761
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:23,131
Jumbo ice-cream soda.
- What flavor?

762
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:27,260
Oh, I don't care.
Spinach, horseradish,
anything you got there.

763
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,568
I'll give you peach.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

764
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:37,905
I feel as though
somebody stepped on
my tongue with muddy feet.

765
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:44,211
This scene's supposed
to be in a saloon,
but the censor cut it out.

766
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:46,152
It'll play just as well.

767
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:51,724
Oh, come on! Where's my drink?

768
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:56,758
Oh, aah!

769
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:01,267
It's killers like you
that give the West a bad name.

770
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:06,471
Give me a couple of
ladyfingers, will you, please?

771
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:11,704
Thank you.

772
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:21,046
Ah, that's better.

773
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:30,491
So long, Tom. I'd rather be
in a saloon at that.

774
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,402
Don't you worry about it.

775
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,640
But Uncle Bill
said he's going away.

776
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:55,343
Fine, fine. I mean,
now don't worry
about your Uncle Bill.

777
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:58,080
He's lived his life;
ruined mine.

778
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,815
Now it's you
we've got to think about.

779
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:02,449
You're young, you've got
a great career ahead of you.

780
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:03,719
You're gonna do big things.

781
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:05,954
Maybe Uncle Bill
can write you another story.

782
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:09,590
No, no, no, don't say that.
I never want to see him again.

783
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:11,493
He's a numbskull.

784
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:14,092
Do you know
what Uncle would do
if he heard you say that?

785
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,434
No. What would your uncle do
if he heard me say that?

786
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:17,598
This.

787
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:23,640
And if Uncle Billdoesn't work
here anymore, I don't either.

788
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:30,277
But I don't want you to go
away without me, Uncle Bill.

789
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:34,250
But the enterprise which
I'm about to embark on

790
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:36,985
is fraught with eminent peril,

791
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:41,324
much too dangerous for a
young lady of your tender years.

792
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:45,959
Another thing, I promised your
mother I'd look out for you.

793
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,297
But how can you
look out for me

794
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,894
when I'm here and
you're way down there?

795
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:50,598
You want to go to school,
don't you?

796
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:52,106
No.

797
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:54,666
You want to grow up
and be dumb like Zasu Pitts?

798
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:58,407
She only acts like that
in pictures. I like her.

799
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,381
Don't you want to be smart?
- No.

800
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,179
I want to be like you.

801
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:05,044
Don't you think I'm smart?
- Not very.

802
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:06,986
I don't like teachers, anyhow.

803
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:10,688
There's no sense in arguing
with a woman. You go with me...

804
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,318
Yippee!

805
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,555
Look out, dear!

806
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:23,668
Who do you think
you're backing into,
you big lummox?

807
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,810
Hello, Officer.
Here's a dollar and a quarter.

808
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:31,143
Go in there, buy yourself
several outfits.

809
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:32,943
We're liable
to be down there a year.

810
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:34,107
OK. Thanks, Uncle.

811
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:35,650
You're welcome, dear.

812
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:45,585
Hello, Officer.

813
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,861
Am I too near
the plug or something?

814
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,235
I can move out in a minute.
Move out in a minute...

Yes, yes, get in the back.

I'll take care of her, sir.
