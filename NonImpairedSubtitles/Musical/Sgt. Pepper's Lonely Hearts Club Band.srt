to make so many people so happy?

26
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,789
Heartland decided to erect
a Sergeant Pepper weather vane...

27
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:40,094
on top of our city hall.

28

And as mayor,
I presided over the ceremony.

30
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:52,568
At the end, Sergeant Pepper assured us
that he would play us one more tune.

A day none of us

37
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,191
To the town of Heartland,
he left his musical instruments.

38
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:53,501
These instruments have the power
to make dreams come true.

39
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:56,633
And as long as they remained
in Heartland's care,

00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,202
humanity would live
happily forever after.

Sergeant Pepper left

<i>his cherished Golden Eagle.</i>

43

<i>Dougie Shears, veryjealous indeed.</i>

44
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:15,585

<i>to form a new Sergeant Pepper's</i>
<i>Lonely Hearts Club Band.</i>

45
00:05:15,662 --> 00:05:18,495
This band would feature
Billy's three best friends.

<i>Mark, Dave and Bob Henderson.</i>

47
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:25,903
We wondered if there would ever be a new
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

48
00:05:27,574 --> 00:05:30,600
And we wondered what
the new band would sound like.

49
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:34,837
<i>Dougie appointed himself</i>
<i>their business manager...</i>

50

It was 20 years ago today

52
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:51,654
Sergeant Pepper
taught the band to play

53
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:54,165
They've been going
in and out of style

54

to raise a smile
