1
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:02,061
- What a laugh.
- Yeah?

2
00:02:02,138 --> 00:02:05,369
- Yeah, it doesn't mean a thing.
- They laughed at Edison, too.

3
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:07,500
Looks like I'm an assistant
to a guy out of a job.

4
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:09,738
You remember when mahjong
was popular, don't you, Harry?

5
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:11,212
- So what?
- It's a fad.

6
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:13,579
I've staged 50 musical comedies
and I'll stage 50 more.

7
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,639
I hope you're right.

8
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,015
Frazer and Gould are putting
<i>Never Say No</i> into rehearsal...

9
00:02:17,086 --> 00:02:18,280
and I'm doing the numbers.

10
00:02:18,354 --> 00:02:21,790
- Am I going with you?
- Lf they don't run out of ink. Let's go.

11
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:33,530
- Hiya, Kent.
- Hello, boys.

12
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:35,230
When does <i>Never Say No</i>
go into rehearsal?

13
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:38,103
Chester, it don't. You can't give
the public what they don't want.

14
00:02:38,174 --> 00:02:41,143
- What show are you gonna do?
- No show if we're in our right mind.

15
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:44,339
People ain't paying for shows no more.
Talking pictures is what they want.

16
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,642
So, it don't mean a thing, huh?

17
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:48,343
Plays is a dead issue.
We're in the picture business, exhibitors.

18
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,749
Yeah, we just bought four houses.

19
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:53,516
They deliver the show in tin cans
and we got nothing to worry about.

20
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:56,419
So musicals are out, huh?

21
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:58,653
Yeah, come on around the corner
and I'll show you why.

22
00:02:58,728 --> 00:03:02,164
Yeah, come on around the corner
and I'll show you why.

23
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,869
There's the answer.

24
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:15,240
It's a lot better to fill your theater
10 times a day at 40 cents a ticket...

25
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:18,337
than to charge $5 a seat
and have it half-filled once a night.

26
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:21,144
- Yeah, if you're lucky.
- Come on, I'll show you.

27
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:24,175
Won't last.

28
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:27,249
<i>Excuse me, Zeke, offical busness.</i>

29
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:33,624
<i>From now on, he'll be gettng plenty</i>
<i>of orders, but they won't all be by wre.</i>

30
00:03:33,696 --> 00:03:36,790
- Here's your answer.
- Oh, well, no matter.

31
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,862
<i>I'm so proud of you, John.</i>

32
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:02,584
So, you're in the picture business, hey, Si?

33
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,650
Who's that, Whistler's mother?

34
00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:07,127
There's competition.
We're booking a house down the street.

35
00:04:07,196 --> 00:04:09,255
So we give them a little prologue
to fit the picture.

36
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,765
What's the picture, <i>Uncle Tom 's Cabn?</i>

37
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,357
We're showing <i>Slaves of the Desert.</i>

38
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:14,665
So we put on something oriental
to fit the plot.

39
00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:16,932
That prologue wouldn't fit anything
but an ash can.

40
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,497
Just the same,
it costs more than the picture.

41
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:22,772
Say, why don't you let me put on
some of those prologues for you?

42
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,814
- No, no. No more prologues.
- No more prologues, Chester.

43
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:27,577
That oriental flesh is too expensive.

44
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,916
After this, we're giving our customers
talking pictures and nothing else.

45
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:35,286
Well, so long.
I gotta break the bad news to the wife.

46
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,025
Red line, I hear you calling me.

47
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:41,093
Public wants talking pictures
and talking pictures only.

48
00:04:41,164 --> 00:04:44,224
Listen, what you better do
is get yourself another job.

49
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,461
Maybe I haven't made myself
understood, honey.

50
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,004
They're not doing
any more musical shows.

51
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:51,768
I always said they'd catch up with you.

52
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:53,966
Is it my fault if somebody invented
talking pictures?

53
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,671
I don't care whose fault it is.
It's time you earned some money.

54
00:04:56,746 --> 00:04:59,237
I'm used to good clothes
and everything that goes with it.

55
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:02,182
- Well, haven't I always given you...
- Yeah. What goes with it.

56
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:05,982
Listen, I'm fed up with you
and I have been for a long time.

57
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,284
Well.

58
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:13,860
- What shall we do about it?
- I'll show you.

59
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,900
Here, sign that and I'll be
tickled to death to get a divorce.

60
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,277
- You sure this is the way you want it?
- Absolutely.

61
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,652
Well, that's that.

62
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:42,223
Here's your aspirin, 18 cents.

63
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:45,550
Say, how do you do it?
The place next door charges a quarter.

64
00:05:45,628 --> 00:05:48,290
Yeah, but he's on his own.
We got 100 stores.

65
00:05:48,364 --> 00:05:50,264
- What does that mean?
- We buy in big lots.

66
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,324
When you're buying for one store,
you get soaked.

67
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:53,596
When you're buying for 100...

68
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:55,569
I see, practically name your own price.

69
00:05:55,638 --> 00:05:56,969
That's it.

70
00:05:57,507 --> 00:05:58,906
Say, that's marvelous.

71
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:01,876
The chain store idea solves everything.
Thanks a million.

72
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:05,573
- Hey, your aspirin!
- Take it yourself. My headache's gone.

73
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:08,215
Come on, Al.

74
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,548
Listen, boys, I just bought some aspirin.

75
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,554
- Drunk again?
- No, listen to this, listen to this.

76
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,147
When you've got one drugstore,
you charge 25 cents for aspirin.

77
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:17,522
But when you're buying for 100 stores,
you get it for less.

78
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:19,493
- So you sell it for 18 cents.
- So what?

79
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:21,427
So your house, I mean,
your store is crowded.

80
00:06:21,497 --> 00:06:24,398
That's great, Chester, old boy.
That's a marvelous idea.

81
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,832
Well, don't you get the connection?

82
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:28,302
Yeah, we'll use it.
If we ever open a drugstore.

83
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:31,306
No, listen. When you put on
one prologue, it's too expensive.

84
00:06:31,374 --> 00:06:33,842
But when the same prologue
plays 25, 50, 100 houses...

85
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,502
it doesn't cost a cent more, get it?

86
00:06:35,578 --> 00:06:38,069
- We might have something there.
- Yeah?

87
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:42,147
No, the same scenery, same costumes,
put them on once and they stay put on.

88
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:43,617
But we've only got four theaters.

89
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:45,517
Play them all over Chicago,
all over the country.

90
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:48,421
Exhibitors everywhere will be tickled pink
to get ready-made prologues.

91
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,515
- How do you know?
- It's a cinch.

92
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:50,820
You can give them swell prologues...

93
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:52,827
cheaper than they can
put them on themselves. Why?

94
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:54,556
Because you're
in the chain store business.

95
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,292
- Si, he's right.
- No question about it.

96
00:06:57,366 --> 00:07:00,233
Boys, your name'll be in lights
from the rock bottom coast of Maine...

97
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:02,794
to the sunny strands of California.

98
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,584
You'll have to wait a minute.
Will you take a seat, please?

99
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:17,676
Good morning.

100
00:07:17,753 --> 00:07:20,950
- How about a job, Miss Prescott?
- See Arnold, the casting director.

101
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,116
- Any mail?
- Nine out-of-town calls.

102
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,183
Only nine? We must be slipping.

103
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:27,060
- Hello.
- Good morning.

104
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,598
- Is the boss in yet?
- I haven't seen Mr. Kent this morning.

105
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:31,633
- Maybe you blinked and missed him?
- Possibly.

106
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,191
- Hello, girls!
- Hello, Nan!

107
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:37,137
- Mr. Gould wants to see Mr. Kent.
- Oh, I'll put that in my memory book.

108
00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:43,170
- Is Mr. Kent in?
- No, but I'm his secretary.

109
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:46,682
- This is something very personal.
- That's the kind of a secretary I am.

110
00:07:47,683 --> 00:07:50,413
Well, you see, I'm a title-thinker-upper.

111
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,749
Honest, I am.
My real business is insurance...

112
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:56,189
but I have a lot of spare time
so I think up titles.

113
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:59,626
- Right out of your head?
- Yes, here's some I thought up yesterday.

114
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:03,426
"Girls of Spain, Girls of France,
Girls of South America"...

115
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:04,761
Keep them under your hat.

116
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:06,699
What do you do,
just travel around the world?

117
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:07,793
That's right.

118
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,270
Maybe you could use them for prologues.
I'll sell them cheap.

119
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:12,136
Tell you what you do,
you go over to Gladstone.

120
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,675
Sounds like his kind of stuff.

121
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,041
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

122
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:24,819
Here you are.

123
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:28,420
- Cats!
- First drink that.

124
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:31,784
Working all night again. I thought you said
you were going home early.

125
00:08:31,861 --> 00:08:33,419
I did go home, that is...

126
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:36,590
I mean, I started to go home,
right after dress rehearsal, about 3:00 a.m.

127
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,827
And then bingo! I got an idea. Cats!

128
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:40,835
I was walking on the street
and saw some cats.

129
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:43,064
You ever see cats walk? Just like that.

130
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:44,163
A regular dance rhythm.

131
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,141
- So, you came right back here?
- That's just what I did.

132
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,837
I got the whole thing all mapped out.

133
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:52,472
Seven boys and seven girls, tomcats
and pussycats, cast down in one.

134
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:54,209
Then we go to full stage
with an alley drop...

135
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,648
with the ash cans and a board fence.

136
00:08:55,718 --> 00:08:58,482
Twelve girls come out in kitten costumes.
They're the children, see?

137
00:08:58,554 --> 00:08:59,543
Now forget the cats, will you?

138
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,557
If you don't let up, you're going to
meow yourself into a padded cell.

139
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,684
Now, go on, get washed
and I'll get you a clean shirt.

140
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,524
You're right, Nan. You're perfectly right.
Perfectly right.

141
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:09,531
But it's still a good idea.

142
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:11,328
- Here you are.
- Oh, thanks.

143
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,503
Oh, get Mr. Kent
some tomato juice, toast and coffee.

144
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:18,665
And a bottle of milk for the cat.

145
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,710
Hello? Yes, all right, wait a minute.
Hold on.

146
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:26,738
The Gay Nineties unit
calling from Kansas City.

147
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,443
The park number runs too long.

148
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:30,542
All right, I'll talk to him.

149
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:38,482
Hello? Hello, cut out your first chorus
and open up with your second.

150
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:40,893
That'll fix it, won't it? All right, fine.

151
00:09:42,231 --> 00:09:44,722
Two units came in yesterday,
finished their tour.

152
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,360
Say, you're slowing up.
Haven't sent out a unit this week.

153
00:09:47,436 --> 00:09:48,926
We're getting two next week.

154
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,405
That is if I can stay out
of the laughing academy that long.

155
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:54,204
I put a peach into rehearsal yesterday.
Prosperity idea.

156
00:09:54,277 --> 00:09:56,404
- Ring Harry for me, will you?
- Skulking Thompson?

157
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,209
- What have you got against him?
- Just don't like him, that's all.

158
00:09:59,282 --> 00:10:01,341
Sometimes I get the feeling
you don't like anybody.

159
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:03,044
If you only knew.

160
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,252
Come in.

161
00:10:05,755 --> 00:10:07,017
- Hello, Bea.
- Hello, Nan.

162
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:08,249
Good morning, Mr. Kent.

163
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:09,951
- Where's Thompson?
- Out for a few minutes.

164
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,324
He'll be out for life
if he doesn't stick closer to business.

165
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:13,885
Gould signed 30 more theaters.

166
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:16,454
That means I've got to think
of three new prologues a week.

167
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,466
Dust off the straightjacket, baby,
we'll need it.

168
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,558
You'll need it.

169
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:23,196
Mr. Kent, about the bridesmaid unit,
we're short six mirrors.

170
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:24,603
Well, take the...

171
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:27,231
Yeah?

172
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:29,400
What?

173
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:31,438
Wait a minute.

174
00:10:31,514 --> 00:10:32,776
- More trouble.
- What is it?

175
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:35,510
Theater in Savannah burned down,
costumes and scenery ruined.

176
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:36,710
Never a dull moment.

177
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:38,447
- The soldier girl unit?
- Yeah.

178
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:41,490
This is their last week.
Why not bring them in?

179
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,785
That's right.

180
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:45,354
Hello, this is your last week, isn't it?

181
00:10:45,428 --> 00:10:47,362
Bring them in,
we'll put them in something else.

182
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,522
What?

183
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:51,691
A nice, big coffin,
and I'll lie down alongside.

184
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:56,896
There's a girl for you.

185
00:10:56,972 --> 00:10:58,837
- What kind of a girl?
- With brains!

186
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,773
You can buy beautiful women
a dime a dozen.

187
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:02,674
- She's got up here.
- So have I.

188
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,406
- What?
- A headache.

189
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:07,679
Always the rap.

190
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:11,050
Here's Old Man River.

191
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,747
- Hey, Chester!
- Not Harry Thompson?

192
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:15,347
Yeah, with a peach of an idea for a unit.
Now get this...

193
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,551
all the girls come in
dressed as different flowers.

194
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:20,720
Then for a finish, the leading lady
is the American Beauty rose.

195
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:22,525
Stop, you're killing me.

196
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:26,034
I almost fell out of my cradle
when the Shuberts did it back in 1912.

197
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,935
- What a memory.
- Old Faithful, I calls it.

198
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:30,699
Hoofers like elephants never forget, baby.

199
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,936
Here, Harry, here's a cat idea.
Get it started right away.

200
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:37,436
Yeah? Yeah, this is Kent.

201
00:11:39,882 --> 00:11:41,543
All right, I'll fix it.

202
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:45,376
The Iceland unit's in trouble,
cupidal man married the leading lady.

203
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,786
And they're both in the hospital.
That's quick work.

204
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:49,882
Listen, Nan, send a new boy and girl in
right away.

205
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,824
Make sure they're not
in love with each other.

206
00:11:51,894 --> 00:11:54,089
Get a couple already married.

207
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:56,663
- Say, Gould wants to see you.
- Nothing strange about that.

208
00:11:56,732 --> 00:11:59,394
- This cat thing ain't bad.
- Well, keep it that way.

209
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:03,131
Nan, there's some notes down there on a
jigsaw puzzle unit and a willow tree idea.

210
00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:05,230
- Type them up, will you?
- I will.

211
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:10,174
American Beauty rose.

212
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:13,510
He said only the cat idea.

213
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:14,875
Yeah?

214
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:19,577
Why should we give him a job?
What can he do?

215
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,453
Why, Scott's a lovely singer and dancer.
Isn't he, Si?

216
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:24,117
Why, he won his spurs in college shows.

217
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:26,753
Oh, dear, dear Mr. Kent, for my sake,
now I implore you...

218
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,765
Now, Harriet, don't get excited.
You know what the doctor said.

219
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:32,560
Say, there's an idea, Si. A doctor unit.

220
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:34,398
The girls, doctors, and the boys, patients.

221
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,873
The girls give the boys a shot in the arm
and they go into a big dance, like this.

222
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:46,838
- Divine, simply divine.
- Like the idea?

223
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,908
Oh, it's a beautiful idea.
Oh, now you see, dear Mr. Kent...

224
00:12:49,985 --> 00:12:54,422
Scott is my protégé and Scott is such
a dear boy, with the sweetest tenor voice.

225
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:56,782
Oh, please, please, Mr. Kent!

226
00:12:57,927 --> 00:12:59,588
- Pardon me.
- Sorry.

227
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:01,760
Mr. Gould is very busy.

228
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:04,356
I'll say he's busy.
They're talking about me.

229
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:07,060
That shouldn't take very long.

230
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:09,696
I'm gonna work here.
Mrs. Gould is giving Kent the good news.

231
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:13,367
Really? Well, as far as I know,
we have all the office boys we need.

232
00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:15,808
I'm a singer, starred in two shows
at Arkansas College.

233
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,140
Rah, rah.

234
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,443
Our shows play in theaters, not colleges.

235
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:27,254
Why, he's waiting outside.
Ready and eager to start his career.

236
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,727
Your mistake.

237
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:37,121
Mr. Kent will be delighted to engage you.
Mr. Kent, I want you to meet Mr. Blair.

238
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:39,394
- How do you do, sir?
- Oh, it's your great opportunity!

239
00:13:39,468 --> 00:13:40,560
Thanks, Harriet.

240
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:44,663
Well, I must say adieu now.
I've gotta go see Si about a check.

241
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,641
Come with me
and I'll put you in the cat unit.

242
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,338
- That's keen.
- Don't be so optimistic.

243
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,874
- Meow.
- Meow.

244
00:13:55,684 --> 00:13:57,743
- Hello, Fannie.
- My name's Myrtle, Mr. Kent.

245
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,878
Myrtle?

246
00:13:59,555 --> 00:14:00,817
Come on, girls.

247
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:05,817
All right, that's good.

248
00:14:06,795 --> 00:14:11,255
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight. Once again.

249
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:15,264
One, two, three, four, five, six.

250
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:19,796
Hold it!

251
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:26,040
- Got a new boy for you, Mac.
- I don't need him.

252
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,106
Neither did I but I caught him.

253
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:29,949
He's yours, now.

254
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:32,248
Sit down.

255
00:14:34,523 --> 00:14:36,320
<i>In sprngtme, n fall tme</i>

256
00:14:36,392 --> 00:14:38,053
<i>I face the sun at all tmes</i>

257
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,096
<i>I'm one step ahead of my shadow</i>

258
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:43,130
<i>It's fathful and noble</i>

259
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:44,790
<i>The deuce of all my troubles</i>

260
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:46,528
<i>I'm havng a jolly tme</i>

261
00:14:46,602 --> 00:14:48,331
<i>Travelng the world and I'm</i>

262
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:52,704
<i>One step ahead of my shadow</i>

263
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:54,709
Hold it, hold it!

264
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:57,436
What's the matter now?

265
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,283
This number's as dead
as Chelsea's tonsils.

266
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,818
I worry about this and I worry about that...

267
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:05,854
Yeah, I know.
You got the kids looking worried, too.

268
00:15:05,921 --> 00:15:07,980
This is a prosperity unit.
Some life and some pep.

269
00:15:08,057 --> 00:15:09,649
Dance on your feet, don't die on them.

270
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:12,558
Here's the way to attack that finish.
Come on, let's go.

271
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:15,522
- You got it?
- Yeah.

272
00:15:15,598 --> 00:15:16,895
- Sure.
- All right. Then do it.

273
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:20,697
I get it, but I got too much
on my shoulders.

274
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:24,865
It's all her fault.
She gives me absolutely nothing.

275
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,343
How can we look prosperity when he's
got depression all over that pan of his?

276
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:32,445
There, you see, Mr. Kent?
See what I'm up against?

277
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,608
I'm afraid if this keeps up
I'll have to resign.

278
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,416
You and me both. But until we do,
keep on working, will you?

279
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:41,422
Come on, let's do it.
All right now, come on.

280
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,152
Give us a pickup there. Come on. Right!

281
00:15:44,226 --> 00:15:45,887
<i>It's fathful and noble</i>

282
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:47,394
<i>The deuce of all my troubles</i>

283
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:49,055
<i>I'm havng a jolly tme</i>

284
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:51,099
<i>Travelng the world and I'm</i>

285
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:55,068
<i>One step ahead of my shadow</i>

286
00:15:55,738 --> 00:15:56,796
Now what?

287
00:15:56,905 --> 00:16:00,568
We'll have to call off the prosperity unit.
Gladstone just put one on.

288
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:03,908
I slave day and night worrying about ideas
and Gladstone steals them.

289
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:05,344
He's been doing it for months.

290
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:09,612
- All right, girls, let's try it again.
- No, call it off. Prosperity unit's out.

291
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:12,085
That's all, girls. You're excused. What's in?

292
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:15,089
The cat number. We'll put it in rehearsal
right away and you're it.

293
00:16:15,157 --> 00:16:17,455
I don't know anything about cats.
I never had a cat.

294
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:19,289
I've got one for you. It's up in my office.

295
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:20,692
Yeah, but what'll I do with it?

296
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:23,129
Go up and get him. Make a pal of him.
Study his movements.

297
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:26,531
Oh, no, listen, I'm an animal trainer,
not a dance director.

298
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:31,437
Oh, no, I'm a dance trainer,
not an animal...

299
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:36,438
You got me so worried
I don't know what I am.

300
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:41,310
I got bad news for you, Chester.
You can't use the cat idea.

301
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:44,147
You're gonna start to tell me
what I can and what I can't use.

302
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:47,279
It's my job to see that our prologues
fit in with the censor's regulations.

303
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:48,550
I'm only doing my duty.

304
00:16:48,624 --> 00:16:51,320
Oh, I see, the tomcats
and the pussycats are all right.

305
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:53,725
- But the kittens are illegitimate.
- They certainly are.

306
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:56,731
Unless they're married by a preacher cat.
No preacher cat, no kittens.

307
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,427
No, you can't use it in 39 cities.

308
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:02,695
Well, I've got some bad news for you.
You're fired.

309
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,171
You can't fire me. Mrs. Gould's my sister.

310
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,175
I don't care if she's your Aunt Minnie.
Get out of here and stay out.

311
00:17:08,243 --> 00:17:10,871
- Yeah, we'll see about that.
- Get out of here!

312
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:17,385
Get that cat out of here.

313
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,785
You don't suppose I want him in here,
do you?

314
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:23,086
Now I got cats to worry about.
I better quit, huh?

315
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:24,716
We'll go into that later, sweetheart.

316
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:29,059
Mr. Kent, I have here got all the cat music
from our library.

317
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,689
- Anything good?
- Yeah, sure.

318
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:34,031
<i>"Cat and the Fddle, Ktten on the Keys,</i>
<i>You are the Cats...</i>

319
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:38,267
<i>"Cats on Parade, Cat's Meow, Crazy Cat...</i>

320
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:40,967
<i>"Pussycat, Pussycat,</i>
<i>Where Have You Been?</i>

321
00:17:41,043 --> 00:17:45,070
<i>"Me and My Cat Both Love You,</i>
and <i>Love Me and Love My Cat. "

322
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,010
- Thompson just came in.
- Well, stall him till I get there.

323
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,983
Get <i>Ktten on the Keys</i>
right over to Francis...

324
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:52,145
and make an orchestration
of <i>Cats on Parade</i> in B flat.

325
00:17:52,221 --> 00:17:53,779
<i>- Cats on Parade</i> in B flat.
- Children!

326
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:57,383
Children, gather around.
I want you to watch this cat.

327
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:07,562
So I'm giving you some advice.
Go out and find yourself a nice, new job.

328
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:08,830
I got one.

329
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:10,132
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

330
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:13,470
From now on my business address is
General Director, Gladstone Prologues.

331
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:15,169
Well, that's fine. After they fire you...

332
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:17,235
you can put on your dance
at the Old Soldier's Home.

333
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:18,904
The gate's open.

334
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,442
Gladstone.

335
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:26,254
- I bet that's our leak.
- I bet you're right.

336
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:28,152
Why, that dirty lowdown...

337
00:18:29,925 --> 00:18:31,153
Oh, well.

338
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:33,990
He'll wind up checking soldiers
when he has to think of his own ideas.

339
00:18:34,062 --> 00:18:36,895
He's full of them.
Like American Beauty rose.

340
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:38,963
Say, you know what I'm gonna do?

341
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:42,094
I'm gonna keep a half a dozen
of the chorus people here as models.

342
00:18:42,171 --> 00:18:45,299
Teach the new kids the steps. Like it?

343
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:51,768
Yes, I do. Say, I'll tell you somebody
who'd be swell for a job like that.

344
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:52,814
- Who?
- Bea Thorn.

345
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,213
- No, too valuable where she is.
- But she's a swell dancer.

346
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:58,412
- Used to do a turn in vaudeville.
- No, I don't think she'd be interested.

347
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:02,185
Whatever you say, boss.

348
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:05,622
- Listen, kid, I'm checking out.
- Lf you go, dear, so do I.

349
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:07,787
No, I want you to stick.
I've got a special reason.

350
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:08,887
But I'll never see you.

351
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:10,431
Yes, you will. We'll have dinner tonight.

352
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:13,093
Meet me at my place at 7:00.
I'll tell you how you can help me.

353
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:17,161
Dear Mr. Kent, I promised my father
I'd always look after Charlie.

354
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,070
Think it over, will you, Chester?

355
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:21,632
All right, all right. Take him back.

356
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,938
Only keep away from me
or I'll sock you right in your blue nose.

357
00:19:32,154 --> 00:19:35,317
And don't you dare let him fire
any more of my relatives.

358
00:19:35,457 --> 00:19:37,220
Come along, Charlie.

359
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:49,137
One, two, three, four.

360
00:19:59,381 --> 00:20:03,044
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
These are cats, not elephants.

361
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,916
This is about what I want.
Look, watch carefully.

362
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:13,521
Oh, I get it.

363
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,794
No, I want that certain rhythm.

364
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:23,634
That certain rhythm,
it's preying on my mind.

365
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:26,139
What you've got to do is watch that cat.

366
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:31,238
I hate cats. I can't get away from him.
I've done everything but sleep with him.

367
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,544
Well, sleep with him. You've gotta get it.
Now go to work.

368
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,617
All right, girls, now please,
pay attention, will you?

369
00:20:37,686 --> 00:20:40,951
- I want you to get this. Now watch me.
- Hold it, Mac, hold it.

370
00:20:41,023 --> 00:20:42,422
- Now, watch!
- Hold it!

371
00:20:42,891 --> 00:20:45,724
The Egyptian unit just came in, 29 people.

372
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:48,059
Call them for rehearsal
tomorrow morning.

373
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,859
We'll put them in the mechanical doll unit.

374
00:20:49,932 --> 00:20:53,834
You must put brassieres on those dolls.
You know Connecticut.

375
00:20:53,902 --> 00:20:55,563
What do they have to do
in Massachusetts?

376
00:20:55,637 --> 00:20:57,366
Wear red flannel drawers?

377
00:20:58,307 --> 00:21:00,832
Rehearsal's off.
Call them back at 8:00 tonight.

378
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:03,537
Rehearsal's over, kids.
Back at 8:00 tonight.

379
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:12,118
- Hello. Say, did you see me dancing?
- Do you crochet, too?

380
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:15,452
No, not me, but I got a tenor voice
people come miles to hear.

381
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,786
Here's a sample of it:

382
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:20,692
<i>Sweet Adelne</i>

383
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:23,360
Hey, wait a minute. What's the matter?
Don't you like it?

384
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:26,060
You must've gone over big
at Arkansas College.

385
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:28,159
Well, I guess you don't appreciate me.

386
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:32,104
Oh, no? Well, here comes someone
who does. Mrs. Gould, he's waiting.

387
00:21:32,174 --> 00:21:34,768
Oh, Scott, dear. I'm just in time.

388
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,171
Yep, just in time.

389
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:42,175
A wet nurse to an alley cat.

390
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,597
Closing time.

391
00:21:56,999 --> 00:22:00,628
Yeah, another day, another gray hair.
Wonder what it's getting me.

392
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:04,160
- You're a one-third partner, aren't you?
- Yep. My third does all the work.

393
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,332
While the other two-thirds
drag down the money.

394
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,239
Yeah. Maybe it's better
to be one of the help.

395
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,437
I'm supposed to be getting
a percentage of the profits.

396
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:12,571
But so far everything's gone
back into production.

397
00:22:12,647 --> 00:22:15,582
So they say.
Why don't you do some investigating?

398
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:19,245
I'm too busy.
I'm daffy trying to think up new ideas.

399
00:22:22,124 --> 00:22:23,716
We've done everything.

400
00:22:28,196 --> 00:22:30,528
"Soldier Girl Unit, Bull Fighters,
Blue Girls...

401
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,363
"Ghost, Baby Dolls, Voo-Doo,
Russian Revolution."

402
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,302
There's nothing left in the world.
A unit a week.

403
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:38,601
Where am I going to get any more ideas?

404
00:22:38,673 --> 00:22:41,141
When I do get them,
Gladstone steals them.

405
00:22:41,576 --> 00:22:42,804
I'm falling apart.

406
00:22:42,878 --> 00:22:45,210
Why don't you get something to eat
and go right home?

407
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,249
No, I can't. I gotta stay and dovetail
all this cat unit stuff.

408
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:51,877
If I promise to take him home with me,
will you go right to bed?

409
00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:55,388
It's a bargain.

410
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:03,456
Say, what's the name of that foreigner
that built the monster he couldn't stop?

411
00:23:03,598 --> 00:23:05,065
Frankenstein.

412
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:08,132
Shake hands with his Aunt Emma.

413
00:23:09,671 --> 00:23:11,036
Good night.

414
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:19,344
Frankenstein. Swell idea for a unit.

415
00:23:36,465 --> 00:23:38,831
That looks vaguely familiar.

416
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:40,867
<i>Bonsor,</i> Nanette.

417
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:43,905
- Vivian!
- I got the janitor to let me in.

418
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:46,202
I knew you wouldn't mind
putting me up for a day or two.

419
00:23:46,274 --> 00:23:48,504
- I thought you were in Hollywood.
- I was.

420
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:51,774
The pictures bored me.
So little culture out there, my dear.

421
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,782
- What is this culture gag all of a sudden?
- I beg your pardon?

422
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,011
Now, relax, will you?
I said, "All of a sudden."

423
00:23:57,085 --> 00:24:00,577
Last time I saw you, your conversation
was practically dese, dems, and doses.

424
00:24:00,655 --> 00:24:02,179
We grow up, you know.

425
00:24:02,257 --> 00:24:05,249
What was it Professor Malanoff said?
"Life is..."

426
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:07,318
- "Life is..."
- Just a bowl of cherries?

427
00:24:07,395 --> 00:24:10,660
- No, but that's a very interesting thought.
- Nerts.

428
00:24:13,502 --> 00:24:15,766
Yeah, sure I love you.
But now listen, give me the dope.

429
00:24:15,837 --> 00:24:17,236
What's happening at Frazer and Gould's?

430
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:18,363
They're rehearsing a new act.

431
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,102
The girls dress like mechanical dolls
and the boys wind them up.

432
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:22,700
Mr. Kent got the idea today.

433
00:24:22,777 --> 00:24:25,610
Swell. Move it, babe,
while I give it to Gladstone.

434
00:24:29,317 --> 00:24:31,217
Remember now, you can only stay
till Aunt Clara...

435
00:24:31,286 --> 00:24:33,584
or somebody or something
comes through.

436
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,223
- Who is it?
- Kent. I wanna talk with you.

437
00:24:38,293 --> 00:24:41,023
Just a minute. You answer the door.

438
00:24:48,203 --> 00:24:49,932
Come in, won't you?

439
00:24:59,848 --> 00:25:03,284
Be right out. The girl is Miss Rich.
Vivian, Mr. Kent.

440
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:05,313
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

441
00:25:05,387 --> 00:25:08,288
In California, I never missed
a Chester Kent Prologue.

442
00:25:08,356 --> 00:25:12,554
They were all so... What shall I say?
Intellectually devised.

443
00:25:12,694 --> 00:25:16,357
I'm glad you liked them, Miss Rich.
I wouldn't call them exactly intellectual.

444
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,830
You're just modest.

445
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:21,926
Every one had a definite central theme.
Brains, you know.

446
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,904
- Maybe you're right at that.
- Anything special?

447
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:30,103
I got some new ideas on that cat stuff,
wanted the outline.

448
00:25:30,178 --> 00:25:31,805
It's on the desk.

449
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,047
Most prologues, Mr. Kent,
are utterly commonplace.

450
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,778
But yours, yours have meaning.

451
00:25:37,852 --> 00:25:41,720
What was it Ruskin said?
"That intangible something."

452
00:25:41,823 --> 00:25:45,054
Oh, Vivian? What ever happened
to that boyfriend of yours?

453
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,855
Is he still a bootlegger?

454
00:25:47,696 --> 00:25:51,962
- Nan is so bourgeois at times.
- Swell gal, though, works like a slave.

455
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,127
Speaking of that, I was reading a most
interesting book, <i>Slavery In Old Afrca.</i>

456
00:25:56,204 --> 00:25:59,037
- Have you read it?
- I don't even have time to read my mail.

457
00:25:59,107 --> 00:26:01,302
Oh, it's filled with the most
fascinating pictures.

458
00:26:01,376 --> 00:26:04,868
- All the women were slaves...
- Hold it, Vivian, I is a coming!

459
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:07,773
Say, that's a natural.

460
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:12,548
- Where is this book?
- I think I know a shop that keeps it.

461
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:15,021
I can see it now. Pretty girls in black face.

462
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,116
"Slaves of Old Africa."
White men capture them.

463
00:26:18,193 --> 00:26:21,822
- Can we get that book tonight?
- Perhaps, if we leave right away.

464
00:26:21,896 --> 00:26:25,332
- Well, let's get going.
- Oh dear, I forgot. I've had no dinner.

465
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,493
Well, have it with me.
After we find a bookshop.

466
00:26:27,569 --> 00:26:29,002
I'd adore it.

467
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:32,664
Good night, Nanette.

468
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:37,244
Oh, good night. Never mind the outline.
I think I've got a new one.

469
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,093
One, two, three, four, five, six, down.

470
00:26:55,163 --> 00:26:56,187
Mr. Francis?

471
00:26:56,631 --> 00:26:58,826
The music department sent down
this new arrangement.

472
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,391
Give it to Joe. Can't you see I'm busy?

473
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:06,673
I've got everything on my shoulders.
Music, costume, girls, cats.

474
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,233
And now I'm beginning to sniffle.

475
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:12,212
I feel as though I'm coming down
with a dreadful...

476
00:27:13,581 --> 00:27:15,412
Now that's where Scotty comes in.

477
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:17,451
- Where is he?
- He isn't in yet.

478
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,615
Mr. Kent's gonna hear about this.
From the beginning, girls.

479
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,250
One, two, three, four, five, six, down.

480
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,688
You know you're late, don't you?

481
00:27:26,761 --> 00:27:29,252
<i>Good mornng, dear teacher</i>
<i>Good mornng to you</i>

482
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:30,628
I'm going to report you.

483
00:27:30,699 --> 00:27:33,600
Mr. Kent is very strict
about chorus people being on time.

484
00:27:33,668 --> 00:27:35,659
- I'm not in the chorus anymore.
- Oh.

485
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,796
- They threw me out.
- I'm sorry.

486
00:27:37,872 --> 00:27:39,237
And you were gonna report me.

487
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:43,175
One, two, three, four, five, six, down.
One, two, three...

488
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,235
Perhaps I could speak to Mr. Kent.
He might...

489
00:27:45,313 --> 00:27:49,613
Now that's not fair, Miss Thorn.
You know I'm all upset. Look.

490
00:27:49,684 --> 00:27:51,914
My hair's turning gray
with so much on my mind...

491
00:27:51,986 --> 00:27:53,920
and you're keeping Scotty from rehearsals.

492
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:55,512
But he isn't in your chorus anymore.

493
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,491
Well, of course, he isn't.
They made him a principal last night.

494
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,152
A principal! Him?

495
00:28:00,228 --> 00:28:01,991
I told you your favorite people had a voice.

496
00:28:02,063 --> 00:28:05,191
All these annoyances piling up.
Come on, Scotty.

497
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,666
I'm waiting for you to sing that number.

498
00:28:08,536 --> 00:28:10,697
Don't get a cold, will you? Come on.

499
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,436
- So long, time clock.
- So long, crooner.

500
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,970
Here's the statement
for the last six months.

501
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,714
Profits going up all the time.

502
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,247
And here's the statement for Mr. Kent.

503
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:25,016
No profits at all.

504
00:28:25,086 --> 00:28:28,214
Well, Mr. Kent's statement shows that
all profits go back into production.

505
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,586
- Is that right?
- Exactly.

506
00:28:29,657 --> 00:28:34,026
- Draw $20,000 in cash for Gould and me.
- Charge it to production costs as usual.

507
00:28:34,095 --> 00:28:36,586
Yes, and take a century note for yourself.

508
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,531
- Good morning.
- Is it still morning?

509
00:29:05,193 --> 00:29:06,854
You beautiful girl.

510
00:29:09,864 --> 00:29:11,661
Nice of you to drop in.

511
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,868
There's some mighty pretty country
around here.

512
00:29:16,938 --> 00:29:20,339
Eleven wires, nine phone calls and one
secretary slowly going out of her mind.

513
00:29:20,408 --> 00:29:21,841
Arrange an audition for some girls.

514
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,741
I want one
to sing that number with Scotty.

515
00:29:23,812 --> 00:29:26,406
And I'm starting a new department today:
Styles and Ideas.

516
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:28,574
- Who's gonna run it?
- She'll be here in a minute.

517
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,845
Has brains and all kinds of culture.
Just what we need.

518
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:34,480
Gave me a swell idea: Slaves of Old Africa.
A hit.

519
00:29:34,622 --> 00:29:36,749
I should've kicked her out
the minute I saw her.

520
00:29:36,825 --> 00:29:37,792
Hello?

521
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,851
Four girls from the Swiss Navy unit
married a quartet in Philadelphia...

522
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:42,794
- yesterday and they wanna quit.
- Quartet any good?

523
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,422
Is the quartet any good? Yeah.

524
00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:46,990
- Put them in the act.
- Put them in the act.

525
00:29:47,902 --> 00:29:51,099
- Sorry, Chester, to keep you waiting.
- Hello, Vivian.

526
00:29:52,307 --> 00:29:54,537
This is Miss Rich.
My secretary, Miss Prescott.

527
00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:57,009
I know Miss Rich, if you remember.

528
00:29:57,078 --> 00:29:59,706
Oh, yeah, that's right.
I met her at your place.

529
00:29:59,781 --> 00:30:02,045
Vivian is the head of our
new Style and Idea department.

530
00:30:02,116 --> 00:30:04,209
I hope you'll both be very happy.

531
00:30:04,986 --> 00:30:08,979
Oh, Nan, would you get
Miss Rich an office?

532
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:12,686
I'm awfully busy, but I'll see that it's done.
This way, please.

533
00:30:12,961 --> 00:30:15,657
Don't forget about
our luncheon engagement, Chester.

534
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,129
- 1:00.
- Right.

535
00:30:26,774 --> 00:30:29,436
- She work here?
- Our new Style and Idea department...

536
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:30,671
the head.

537
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,479
Splendid choice, Chester, splendid choice.

538
00:30:33,548 --> 00:30:35,277
- Get her an office.
- Okay.

539
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:39,151
Here's our semi-annual statement.

540
00:30:48,463 --> 00:30:50,931
- Maybe I'd be better off on a salary.
- I'll say you would.

541
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:53,331
When you've got a third interest?
Don't kid yourself.

542
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:55,835
Frazer and I ain't drawing a cent
out of the business either.

543
00:30:55,904 --> 00:30:57,997
It's tough on you boys.
I don't see how you get along.

544
00:30:58,072 --> 00:31:01,235
And besides, Gladstone's copped
the mechanical doll angle already.

545
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:03,971
- I'll stop it some way, Chester.
- That's gonna be a big help.

546
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:05,603
Between Gladstone stealing all our stuff...

547
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,011
and you saying there are no profits...

548
00:31:07,081 --> 00:31:08,309
I'm getting pretty well fed up.

549
00:31:08,383 --> 00:31:11,284
But, Chester, think of
the Apollo Deluxe Theater.

550
00:31:11,352 --> 00:31:13,047
- So what?
- They're gonna do prologues.

551
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,918
- Forty houses.
- Have you signed them?

552
00:31:14,989 --> 00:31:17,514
Apolinaris says they're too classy
for our regular stuff.

553
00:31:17,592 --> 00:31:19,924
And Gladstone's hot after the contract.

554
00:31:19,994 --> 00:31:22,656
It's up to you, Chester,
to think up something original.

555
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,324
Gladstone again. That means Thompson.

556
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,035
Well, we'll take care of him.

557
00:31:30,104 --> 00:31:33,904
That's the spirit, Chester.
I knew we could count on you.

558
00:31:41,683 --> 00:31:42,911
Come in.

559
00:31:44,786 --> 00:31:46,515
I'm Charlie Bowers.

560
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,851
- Well?
- Mrs. Gould's brother.

561
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:54,691
Of course.
Won't you come in, Mr. Bowers?

562
00:31:54,796 --> 00:31:56,320
Yes, thank you.

563
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:00,265
- Awfully glad you dropped in.
- Yes, same here.

564
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,235
- So sweet of you to say that.
- Yeah.

565
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:05,739
Gives one the feeling of...
What shall I say?

566
00:32:07,108 --> 00:32:08,336
<i>Esprt de corps.</i>

567
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:10,934
Yeah, that's the way I feel about it.

568
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:13,411
Oh, I'd like to ask you, Mr. Bowers...

569
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:15,711
- Pardon me.
- That's all right. Go too far.

570
00:32:16,884 --> 00:32:20,479
All right, girls, stand up!
Show Mr. Kent your legs.

571
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:23,952
- Oh, higher, higher.
- This is an audition, not an exhibition.

572
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,653
I'm not a mind reader, you know.
Down, girls.

573
00:32:27,662 --> 00:32:30,859
This audition is to find a girl
to sing a number with Mr. Blair.

574
00:32:30,932 --> 00:32:32,866
- You all got copies of the song?
- All of them.

575
00:32:32,934 --> 00:32:36,563
Sing it for them once, will you, Scotty?
And, Francis, show the routine.

576
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,700
- Just pick up there.
- Watch this very carefully, girls.

577
00:32:39,774 --> 00:32:42,436
<i>Ah, the moon s here</i>

578
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,479
<i>Ah, and we are here</i>

579
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:50,074
<i>Love s offi to a wonderful start</i>

580
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,611
<i>I'm sttng pretty</i>

581
00:32:53,688 --> 00:32:56,452
<i>And you're by my sde</i>

582
00:32:56,824 --> 00:32:59,850
<i>I'm well-suppled</i>

583
00:32:59,927 --> 00:33:02,919
<i>Plenty of you, plenty to do</i>

584
00:33:02,997 --> 00:33:05,864
<i>Ah, t feels so grand</i>

585
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:08,868
<i>When I hold your hand</i>

586
00:33:08,936 --> 00:33:13,703
<i>There's a hop, skp and jump n my heart</i>

587
00:33:15,176 --> 00:33:19,704
<i>What s ths funny thng</i>
<i>I can't get too much of?</i>

588
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,985
<i>I've got a feelng t's love</i>

589
00:33:28,122 --> 00:33:31,023
All right. You got the idea, girls? Let's go.

590
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:32,786
- Now, who's first?
- Mary.

591
00:33:33,995 --> 00:33:36,020
Give us a pickup. Great.

592
00:33:37,331 --> 00:33:39,925
<i>Ah, the moon s here</i>

593
00:33:40,034 --> 00:33:43,128
<i>Ah, and we are here</i>

594
00:33:44,972 --> 00:33:48,908
Sorry. Sorry, little lady. Next.
You're next. Come on.

595
00:33:50,178 --> 00:33:51,509
Pick up there.

596
00:33:54,582 --> 00:33:59,246
I always get in my singing mood
with perfume. Do you mind?

597
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:01,848
Never mind the smell, honey. Sing.

598
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:07,151
<i>Ah, the moon s here</i>

599
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:10,753
<i>Ah, and we are here</i>

600
00:34:10,832 --> 00:34:14,825
<i>Love s offi to a wonderful start</i>

601
00:34:14,936 --> 00:34:16,460
Sorry. Sorry, won't do.

602
00:34:16,537 --> 00:34:19,131
Why, I've sung before crowned heads.

603
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,636
You've laid yourself wide open for a crack.
We'll let it go. All right, next.

604
00:34:23,711 --> 00:34:25,679
Come on, you're next. Give us a pickup.

605
00:34:27,682 --> 00:34:30,708
<i>Ah, the moon s here</i>

606
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:33,515
<i>Ah, and we are here</i>

607
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:38,824
<i>Love s offi to a beautful start</i>

608
00:34:39,927 --> 00:34:42,395
<i>I'm sttng pretty</i>

609
00:34:42,463 --> 00:34:45,125
<i>You're by my sde</i>

610
00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:47,991
<i>I'm well-suppled</i>

611
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:51,429
<i>Plenty of you, plenty to do</i>

612
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,907
<i>Ah, t feels so grand</i>

613
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:58,206
<i>When you hold my hand</i>

614
00:34:58,279 --> 00:35:02,875
<i>There's a hop, skp and jump n my heart</i>

615
00:35:03,951 --> 00:35:08,820
<i>What s ths funny thng</i>
<i>I can't get too much of?</i>

616
00:35:11,092 --> 00:35:15,961
<i>I've got a feelng t's love</i>

617
00:35:17,231 --> 00:35:19,324
All right, that's it. Get to work, Francis.

618
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,492
- Nice going, kid.
- Thanks.

619
00:35:20,568 --> 00:35:23,765
That's all for the singers.
Dancing girls on the stage.

620
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:25,635
Hit that again for me, will you?

621
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,469
On the stage, girls, hurry!

622
00:35:32,513 --> 00:35:34,640
Come, dear.
I've come to take you to lunch.

623
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,479
Gee, that's nice of you, Harriet.
I'd love to go, but...

624
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,747
I'm not eating lunch anymore.
I'm in training now.

625
00:35:39,821 --> 00:35:42,551
Well, you can walk with me as far
as Si's office, can't you?

626
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:45,592
- Si's office? Oh, yeah.
- All right, sweetie pie.

627
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:53,690
- Have you seen Miss Thorn?
- I think she's gone to lunch.

628
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:55,497
Oh. Thanks.

629
00:35:56,838 --> 00:36:01,798
<i>What s ths funny thng</i>
<i>I can't get too much of?</i>

630
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:08,879
<i>I've got a feelng t's love</i>

631
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,474
Lunch!

632
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,120
- Have you seen Mr. Blair?
- He's gone to lunch with Mrs. Gould.

633
00:36:23,197 --> 00:36:24,459
He would.

634
00:36:26,734 --> 00:36:28,497
Well, use a short introduction.

635
00:36:30,504 --> 00:36:33,337
Then bring Miss Schubert
out for her number. Yeah.

636
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,867
These wires just came.

637
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,309
No, no, no, do it that way.
Just that way. Yeah.

638
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,739
These wires just came.

639
00:36:39,814 --> 00:36:41,805
I can't look at them now.
I got a date for lunch.

640
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:45,114
Phone Miss Rich and tell her
I'll be right over, will you?

641
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,535
Miss Rich, please.

642
00:37:04,272 --> 00:37:06,900
Miss Rich? I'm calling for Mr. Kent.

643
00:37:07,174 --> 00:37:09,039
Yes, he won't be able
to have lunch with you.

644
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,805
No, he said you may take
the afternoon off.

645
00:37:10,878 --> 00:37:14,245
He doesn't want you
to strain yourself the first day.

646
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:25,057
- Hello, hello.
- It's the only vacant seat.

647
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:27,287
At least you're sitting next to
another good singer.

648
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:29,795
I'll try not to let it spoil my lunch.

649
00:37:30,097 --> 00:37:32,861
Why, Scott dear, you told me
you stopped eating lunch.

650
00:37:32,934 --> 00:37:35,767
Well, I have. You see, actually,
I'm just having breakfast.

651
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,669
Well, I'll forgive you this time,
you naughty boy.

652
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,633
I'll take spinach.

653
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:45,211
If I were a man, I wouldn't be a lapdog
tied to any woman's apron strings.

654
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:47,839
- I might surprise you.
- You probably won't.

655
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,883
Mr. Kent, I wanna quit.

656
00:37:55,957 --> 00:37:57,424
Don't be silly, singers never quit.

657
00:37:57,491 --> 00:37:59,152
They hang on
till somebody knocks them off.

658
00:37:59,226 --> 00:38:01,956
I know, but that's why I wanna quit.
There's no future in singing.

659
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,860
- What do you wanna do?
- I wanna be your assistant.

660
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:05,330
You haven't filled Thompson's job yet.

661
00:38:05,399 --> 00:38:07,560
I'll work a year for nothing
if you insist on a sample.

662
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:09,159
You're reading those magazine ads again.

663
00:38:09,236 --> 00:38:11,033
"How I Became President
of the Atlas Pickle Works."

664
00:38:11,105 --> 00:38:13,300
Give me a chance at the job, will you?
That's all I want.

665
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,807
I know I'll make good. But if I fail...

666
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,673
We'll make-believe you're Mrs. Gould's
relative. Keep you on anyway.

667
00:38:17,745 --> 00:38:19,576
- You've got the job.
- Thanks.

668
00:38:21,983 --> 00:38:25,783
So Mrs. Gould sniveled you
into another job.

669
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,078
I got this absolutely on my own.

670
00:38:28,656 --> 00:38:30,920
Is there any business
you wish to discuss with me?

671
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:34,484
No, that's the trouble with you.
You're all business. All efficiency.

672
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,655
You're not alive. You're not a bit feminine.

673
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,426
Look at that dress. Look at those glasses.

674
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:40,262
All you need is a pair
of brown-paper shoes...

675
00:38:40,334 --> 00:38:43,167
and <i>The Atlantc Monthly</i>
tucked under your arm.

676
00:38:43,871 --> 00:38:45,168
Anything else?

677
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,799
That's all. If I need you, I'll send for you.

678
00:38:55,282 --> 00:38:57,011
No, Mr. Kent is busy.

679
00:38:57,084 --> 00:39:00,542
- Nan, are you busy?
- No, just dreaming lazily about life.

680
00:39:00,621 --> 00:39:02,350
Tell me, where do you get your hair done...

681
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,653
and where do you get
all those pretty dresses?

682
00:39:04,725 --> 00:39:06,317
What's the idea?

683
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,323
You're the type men like and...

684
00:39:08,396 --> 00:39:09,556
Me?

685
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,096
Know any more funny stories?

686
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,038
Mr. Kent.

687
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:30,340
Yeah?

688
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:34,613
Listen, cut a minute out of George's
comedy...

689
00:39:35,256 --> 00:39:38,589
and then bring the trumpet sextet
up before the Hawaiian number.

690
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:39,819
See my secretary.

691
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:41,486
And if you're still overtime...

692
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,321
Wait a minute,
call me back in five minutes.

693
00:39:48,936 --> 00:39:50,233
- No!
- Yes.

694
00:39:50,671 --> 00:39:52,662
The one girl in the place
that showed some sense.

695
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:56,232
I got sick of looking like a schoolteacher
and I'm sick of working in an office.

696
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,971
I wanna go back on the stage.

697
00:39:58,045 --> 00:40:00,445
It was just a question of time
before this place got to you.

698
00:40:00,514 --> 00:40:02,243
- Did you say she could dance?
- One of the best.

699
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,749
All right. Hold it!

700
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,183
- Hold it!
- Hold it!

701
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:06,981
Let's see what you can do.

702
00:40:07,288 --> 00:40:09,688
Play something in two-four.
Same thing. Go ahead.

703
00:40:25,706 --> 00:40:27,105
Fine, that's grand.

704
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,438
How'd you like the job
of teaching new kids the routines?

705
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,535
Gee, Mr. Kent, that'd be swell.

706
00:40:31,612 --> 00:40:33,944
All right, job's yours. Oh, Francis...

707
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,616
Miss Thorn is your new assistant.

708
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:40,045
It can't be done, Mr. Kent, it can't be done.

709
00:40:40,721 --> 00:40:43,212
All right, Miss Thorn, you watch it
from over there, will you?

710
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:45,155
All right, girls, places.

711
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:48,758
Another good gal gone wrong.

712
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,954
<i>Come out, come out</i>

713
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,498
<i>Come out and get your lovng</i>

714

<i>The ktty-cat s coong</i>

752
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:26,014
<i>He shows a lot of common sense</i>

753
00:43:26,086 --> 00:43:27,610
<i>He knows, he knows</i>

754
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,553
<i>There's always somethng dong</i>

755
00:43:29,623 --> 00:43:31,853
<i>Sttng on a backyard fence</i>

756
00:43:31,925 --> 00:43:33,290
That's all!

757
00:43:36,297 --> 00:43:38,765
Those contortions are pretty vulgar.

758
00:43:38,832 --> 00:43:40,959
One thing after another.

759
00:43:43,771 --> 00:43:45,204
Just a minute.

760
00:43:45,272 --> 00:43:48,105
- You look like a girl I used to know.
- Oh, really?

761
00:43:48,175 --> 00:43:50,109
You're new here, aren't you?

762
00:43:50,678 --> 00:43:53,238
I thought so.
You tried to fool me, didn't you?

763
00:43:53,647 --> 00:43:56,946
But what a change. You're beautiful.
And what a dancer.

764
00:43:57,685 --> 00:43:59,710
Is that all you can say?

765
00:43:59,787 --> 00:44:01,755
Well, how about a little kiss then?

766
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:05,818
Mrs. Gould's little boy? I should say not.

767
00:44:08,495 --> 00:44:10,463
Chester, you gotta do about
something quick.

768
00:44:10,531 --> 00:44:12,999
The Apollo deal's hot
and Gladstone's after the contract.

769
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,432
Forget Gladstone.

770
00:44:14,635 --> 00:44:17,604
I'll give you something tomorrow
that'll knock Apollo for a loop.

771
00:44:17,671 --> 00:44:18,865
Yeah.

772
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,532
Now all I have to do is think it up.

773
00:44:21,608 --> 00:44:23,337
Maybe we'd better go back to your office.

774
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,604
Yeah...

775
00:44:24,945 --> 00:44:27,675
Yeah, that's right.
Can't keep my mind on the race here.

776
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,147
But, Chester?

777
00:44:29,316 --> 00:44:31,284
I'll pick you up at 6:00.

778
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,950
You're gonna get picked up again.

779
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,195
Old Faithful's gone blank on me.

780
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:46,061
I thought of a thousand ideas
and every one of them moth-eaten.

781
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:49,466
If the little girl's not too bold,
how's for me sticking with you to get it.

782
00:44:49,536 --> 00:44:51,265
You could think out loud.

783
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:52,872
- Like we used to?
- It might help.

784
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,773
- Keep throwing ideas at me.
- And you throw the poor ones right back.

785
00:44:55,843 --> 00:44:56,867
Sold.

786
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,878
We'll give Apollo a show
if it takes all night.

787
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,538
We'll have dinner, think and walk.

788
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:01,842
Let's go.

789
00:45:13,394 --> 00:45:14,884
Got something?

790
00:45:15,929 --> 00:45:18,193
It was so old you had to fumigate it.

791
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:24,296
Say, how about a great big coffee pot,
boys come out, and the girls come out...

792
00:45:26,507 --> 00:45:28,236
and the audience goes out.

793
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,073
I think the jury better go out again.

794
00:45:32,913 --> 00:45:35,347
We could have a band on the stage
and the chorus in the pit.

795
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:37,008
How about trees?

796
00:45:40,287 --> 00:45:42,380
We've had flowers, pictures...

797
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:48,050
tables, radios, statues,
more tables, sofas, pianos.

798
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,025
Oh, nerts.

799
00:45:54,134 --> 00:45:55,897
No good for a unit.

800
00:46:04,378 --> 00:46:05,436
Hello?

801
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,844
Who's speaking? Nan?

802
00:46:07,915 --> 00:46:09,177
Nobody else.

803
00:46:09,249 --> 00:46:11,444
I wouldn't think of waking him.
He's sleeping.

804
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:14,419
And so was I when you called.
Goodbye, dear.

805
00:46:17,324 --> 00:46:19,451
Move over, Chester, darling.

806
00:46:27,468 --> 00:46:28,628
Hello?

807
00:46:29,403 --> 00:46:32,099
It can't be out of order.
I just spoke to them.

808
00:46:32,606 --> 00:46:35,040
- How'd you sleep?
- Like a newborn child.

809
00:46:35,108 --> 00:46:38,373
So did I. No ideas, though.
Didn't even dream of one.

810
00:46:41,582 --> 00:46:44,176
Maybe we'd better start all over again.

811
00:46:45,919 --> 00:46:48,581
How do you suppose
an insane asylum idea would go?

812
00:46:48,655 --> 00:46:50,748
I could play the lead myself
without any trouble.

813
00:46:50,824 --> 00:46:52,018
Me, too.

814
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,850
Hey, look at this.

815
00:46:55,963 --> 00:46:58,397
"What happens to
unproduced musical comedies?"

816
00:46:58,465 --> 00:47:01,730
- What does happen to them?
- "They gather dust on the shelves."

817
00:47:04,438 --> 00:47:05,837
Say, we've got it.

818
00:47:06,206 --> 00:47:07,833
I know we've got it!

819
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,933
- Apolinaris is in the bag.
- What do you mean?

820
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:11,910
"What happens to
unproduced musical comedies?"

821
00:47:11,979 --> 00:47:13,640
I can tell you
what's gonna happen to them.

822
00:47:13,714 --> 00:47:15,443
We'll put them in picture houses,
prologues!

823
00:47:15,516 --> 00:47:16,881
- Grand!
- Cut them down to 40 minutes.

824
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:19,043
Give them a picture
and a musical comedy for 50 cents.

825
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:20,814
Most picture fans
never saw a musical comedy.

826
00:47:20,888 --> 00:47:23,379
That's the idea. Come on, let's grab a cab!

827
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:25,481
Instead of 40 people,
our musicals will have 80.

828
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:28,119
- I'm afraid of it.
- Now, I know it's good. We'll do it.

829
00:47:28,195 --> 00:47:29,594
Sure, we can't miss.

830
00:47:29,663 --> 00:47:31,824
I'll have George Apolinaris
up to dinner tonight.

831
00:47:31,899 --> 00:47:33,389
I'll be there.

832
00:47:33,634 --> 00:47:35,932
He'll be there. Our troubles are over.

833
00:47:39,973 --> 00:47:41,907
There you are, Mr. Apolinaris.

834
00:47:41,975 --> 00:47:46,071
You give them a musical comedy
and a picture, all for 50 cents.

835
00:47:46,146 --> 00:47:48,876
It's good. But somebody beat you to it.

836
00:47:49,316 --> 00:47:50,442
Impossible.

837
00:47:50,851 --> 00:47:52,876
You know Thompson,
Gladstone's director?

838
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,353
- Doing the same thing?
- Sure, same thing.

839
00:47:55,422 --> 00:47:59,085
- But he stole our idea.
- Well, sue him. It ain't my funeral.

840
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,488
Gladstone's got three prologues
in rehearsal.

841
00:48:02,563 --> 00:48:04,463
Gonna show them to me Sunday.

842
00:48:04,565 --> 00:48:07,625
Now here's what I'll do.
You fellows get three started...

843
00:48:07,701 --> 00:48:09,828
but they got to be ready Saturday night.

844
00:48:09,903 --> 00:48:14,135
I'll preview them in three of my houses
around town and get audience reaction.

845
00:48:14,241 --> 00:48:17,733
What I like ain't worth a cent.
What audiences like is worth a million.

846
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:21,872
- And if the audience likes our stuff?
- You'll get the contract for the whole 40.

847
00:48:21,949 --> 00:48:24,713
If not, I sign with Gladstone.

848
00:48:25,385 --> 00:48:27,512
Give me a good reason why not.

849
00:48:29,423 --> 00:48:30,720
I ate too much.

850
00:48:30,791 --> 00:48:32,816
We'll see Kent and let you know.

851
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,620
That's up to you gents.

852
00:48:35,362 --> 00:48:37,592
Well, so long.

853
00:48:42,603 --> 00:48:44,833
I hope your dinner
shouldn't make me indigestion.

854
00:48:44,905 --> 00:48:47,032
Yeah, well, good night. Good night.

855
00:48:48,909 --> 00:48:50,342
We gotta get hold of Kent.

856
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:52,275
Try his secretary, she'll know where he is.

857
00:48:57,584 --> 00:48:58,812
Hello?

858
00:48:58,952 --> 00:49:00,544
Oh, yes, Mr. Frazer.

859
00:49:01,788 --> 00:49:03,517
Well, I may see him later.

860
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:07,122
Yeah, it'll be late all right,
but I'll surely send him over.

861
00:49:30,484 --> 00:49:32,577
How's the world's best secretary?

862
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:41,618
- I'll take care of him.
- Looks like you have already.

863
00:49:43,096 --> 00:49:44,461
Here, drink this.

864
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,761
They want you
at Frazer's apartment right away.

865
00:49:50,037 --> 00:49:52,130
Can't be annoyed, can't be annoyed.

866
00:49:53,206 --> 00:49:55,766
Got the greatest news of my life tonight.

867
00:49:57,678 --> 00:50:00,078
Don't tell me you married that chiseler?

868
00:50:01,348 --> 00:50:03,680
I'll thank you not to insult
the future Mrs. Kent.

869
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,149
I'm glad you said "future."

870
00:50:05,218 --> 00:50:07,743
I always ignore crude persons, dear.

871
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,291
- I'll take care of you later.
- Well, now, wait...

872
00:50:14,461 --> 00:50:18,192
- You got a taxi waiting?
- Always got a taxi waiting.

873
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,630
Now you listen to me.
This is your big chance.

874
00:50:23,704 --> 00:50:27,140
Forty units in deluxe houses.
The whole Apollo circuit.

875
00:50:27,207 --> 00:50:29,038
It's too late for units.

876
00:50:29,209 --> 00:50:31,404
Units to the right of them.
Units to the left of them.

877
00:50:31,478 --> 00:50:33,673
Volleyed and thundered
and lightening and everything.

878
00:50:33,747 --> 00:50:35,612
Come on, now, you get up here!

879
00:50:35,682 --> 00:50:37,673
This is a chance of a lifetime.

880
00:50:40,754 --> 00:50:44,713
All right, all right, I'll go,
but I want you to know I resent this.

881
00:50:47,427 --> 00:50:49,292
How dare you! My fiancé.

882
00:50:49,362 --> 00:50:51,728
Now you scram before I wrap a chair
around your neck.

883
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,663
But it's 3:00 a.m.
Where do you want me to go?

884
00:50:53,734 --> 00:50:55,895
- Listen, you cheap stenographer...
- Outside, Countess.

885
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,767
As long as they have sidewalks,
you've got a job.

886
00:51:02,776 --> 00:51:04,573
So you're gonna hire detectives.

887
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:06,703
A fine pair of quarter-wits
I teamed up with.

888
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:10,011
Every time I get a great idea,
you let Gladstone steal it.

889
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,084
I've got a hunch
you know something about that.

890
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,313
- I don't know a thing.
- What are you gonna do about it?

891
00:51:14,387 --> 00:51:15,445
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

892
00:51:15,522 --> 00:51:17,990
I'm gonna show that big jerk
three prologues by Saturday night...

893
00:51:18,058 --> 00:51:19,082
and we'll stand him on his ear.

894
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,821
I'll give him the greatest show
since he quit the restaurant business.

895
00:51:21,895 --> 00:51:23,556
In three days?
Where'll you get the people?

896
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:24,756
Right in our own studio.

897
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,696
Use three choruses
and double up on the principals.

898
00:51:26,767 --> 00:51:27,756
It can't be done.

899
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,961
Give me absolute authority
till Saturday night, I'll do it.

900
00:51:30,036 --> 00:51:31,128
- You've got it!
- You got it!

901
00:51:31,204 --> 00:51:32,262
It's done!

902
00:51:33,473 --> 00:51:36,033
We've gotta have three
of the greatest prologues ever put on.

903
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:37,371
Now, get this.

904
00:51:37,477 --> 00:51:40,913
Somebody working among us
has been giving Gladstone inside dope.

905
00:51:40,981 --> 00:51:42,414
Selling him my ideas.

906
00:51:42,482 --> 00:51:44,950
And for once, I'm gonna put a stop to it.

907
00:51:45,619 --> 00:51:49,749
Now this is the way we're gonna do it.
Nobody leaves here until Saturday night.

908
00:51:50,991 --> 00:51:52,151
Quiet!

909
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:54,660
You'll eat here and sleep here.

910
00:51:54,728 --> 00:51:57,458
Live three whole days
right here in the studio.

911
00:51:58,165 --> 00:51:59,393
Quiet!

912
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,930
This is war, a blockade.
Anybody comes in, stays in.

913
00:52:04,671 --> 00:52:06,866
- What do you mean, "stays in"?
- Quiet!

914
00:52:07,641 --> 00:52:10,041
Now this is your last chance to get out.

915
00:52:11,144 --> 00:52:14,136
Well? Anybody wanna go?

916
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:15,539
No!

917
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,915
All right. Thanks. This is a large order.

918
00:52:22,455 --> 00:52:24,320
Three prologues in three nights.

919
00:52:24,825 --> 00:52:28,386
We're gonna work your heads off.
Curse you and break your hearts.

920
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,554
But by Saturday night,
we'll have what we want.

921
00:52:31,631 --> 00:52:33,531
All right. Hop to it.

922
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,797
This is dangerous, Mr. Gould.
Anything might happen.

923
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,167
Suppose a fire broke out.

924
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,900
Locking us in like this.

925
00:52:40,974 --> 00:52:42,532
He can't do it.

926
00:52:50,684 --> 00:52:52,413
Let me know just as soon as it's done.

927
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,784
Did you check that measure
I told you about?

928
00:53:09,302 --> 00:53:12,362
All girls in this number
to the rehearsal hall.

929
00:53:13,006 --> 00:53:14,530
Come on, girls.

930
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:16,501
Come on, get ready.

931
00:53:22,415 --> 00:53:24,076
Come on, honey, be reasonable, will you?

932
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:26,015
She and I are all washed up
and you know it.

933
00:53:26,086 --> 00:53:28,520
Yeah, but does Mrs. Gould know it?

934
00:53:29,422 --> 00:53:32,983
It was awfully nice of you
to bring me in here, really.

935
00:53:35,395 --> 00:53:38,159
Come along, Barrington.
I'll introduce you to the stage director.

936
00:53:38,231 --> 00:53:39,994
Thanks ever so much.

937
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,767
Please sit down right here.

938
00:53:49,342 --> 00:53:51,640
I want you to meet Mr. Barrington.

939
00:53:52,012 --> 00:53:53,912
Here's the man you want to see.

940
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,772
See, what did I tell you?

941
00:53:55,849 --> 00:53:59,216
- It does look like Independence Day.
- Let's celebrate.

942
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,149
Now, there. Look at that.

943
00:54:03,223 --> 00:54:06,056
How can you expect to keep up
a high moral tone with that going on?

944
00:54:06,126 --> 00:54:08,492
I'm awfully glad to have played
love's little messenger...

945
00:54:08,561 --> 00:54:09,721
and brought you two together.

946
00:54:09,796 --> 00:54:11,286
But do you realize
there's work to be done?

947
00:54:11,364 --> 00:54:12,353
Well, we were just...

948
00:54:12,432 --> 00:54:14,696
Would you mind saving about
that much of loving for the act?

949
00:54:14,768 --> 00:54:17,794
We can use it. You're in two prologues.
Miss Thorn, you're in all three.

950
00:54:17,871 --> 00:54:18,929
So how about it?

951
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,870
Is there anything I could do?

952
00:54:20,941 --> 00:54:23,375
- Yeah. See that window over there?
- Yes.

953
00:54:23,443 --> 00:54:26,344
Take a running jump
and I think you can make it.

954
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:33,544
Come on, fellows, this way.
Bring it down the hall. That's it. That way.

955
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,918
Come on, kids! Come and get it!

956
00:54:35,989 --> 00:54:37,616
Go on, let her go.

957
00:54:57,243 --> 00:54:59,438
I'm terribly worried, Doctor.

958
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:03,344
- Quiet, will you!
- There's nothing the matter with you.

959
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:08,080
I feel, Doctor, that I'm gonna have
a dreadful heart attack. You just listen.

960
00:55:10,323 --> 00:55:13,690
Did you hear that? Oh, I am not all right!

961
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,193
That's enough. Who's next?

962
00:55:15,261 --> 00:55:16,853
- I'm next.
- Here.

963
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:20,661
Three prologues in such a short time.
It can't be done, it can't be done.

964
00:55:28,008 --> 00:55:29,669
Get to bed, girls.

965
00:55:36,449 --> 00:55:39,145
- Good night, kids.
- Good night.

966
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:52,993
I just wanted to be sure
you're all safe in bed. Good night.

967
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,231
Good night.

968
00:55:59,837 --> 00:56:01,327
Wake up, gang!

969
00:56:03,107 --> 00:56:04,665
When do we eat?

970
00:56:04,742 --> 00:56:07,870
- Truckload of breakfast just arrived.
- All right!

971
00:56:07,945 --> 00:56:09,913
Rehearsal in 20 minutes.

972
00:56:17,221 --> 00:56:18,654
Left, right!

973
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:23,389
One, two, three, four!

974
00:56:24,662 --> 00:56:26,960
Come on, kids. Come and get it.

975
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,230
One, two, three, four!

976
00:56:34,238 --> 00:56:37,139
One, two, three...

977
00:56:37,975 --> 00:56:38,964
four.

978
00:56:41,212 --> 00:56:42,406
Hello?

979
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,916
I don't care if you wrote the doxology.
Mr. Kent won't see anyone till Monday.

980
00:56:45,983 --> 00:56:48,281
Chester, it's like being in jail.

981
00:56:48,352 --> 00:56:51,810
- Sorry, dear, better get used to it.
- She is used to it.

982
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,350
But how about
our engagement ring, darling?

983
00:56:54,425 --> 00:56:56,450
Get it for you Saturday night.

984
00:56:56,527 --> 00:56:58,085
All right, sweet.

985
00:56:58,162 --> 00:57:01,654
I wouldn't beef about being locked up
with the man I love.

986
00:57:06,737 --> 00:57:09,672
Hello? Yes. Yes, I'll tell him.

987
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:13,301
Apolinaris says your prologue goes on
at the Jupiter Theatre 9:00 tonight.

988
00:57:13,377 --> 00:57:14,435
How about the other two?

989
00:57:14,512 --> 00:57:16,639
Mercury Theatre at 10:00,
the Diana Theatre at 11:00.

990
00:57:16,714 --> 00:57:18,545
Looks like we're in the laps
of the Greek gods.

991
00:57:18,616 --> 00:57:19,878
- You worried?
- Well...

992
00:57:19,951 --> 00:57:22,784
that water nymph number will
empty the theater like a stench bomb.

993
00:57:22,854 --> 00:57:24,583
There's still time to change it.

994
00:57:24,655 --> 00:57:27,590
It's too late and I'm too tired.

995
00:57:27,658 --> 00:57:30,491
Every time I fool with it,
I ruin it some more.

996
00:57:31,929 --> 00:57:34,762
Old Faithful's gone blank
on me completely.

997
00:57:37,468 --> 00:57:39,959
Hey, wait a minute.
This is Mr. Kent's private office.

998
00:57:40,037 --> 00:57:41,698
How nice. I'm Mrs. Kent.

999
00:57:41,772 --> 00:57:44,206
And I'm Lydia Pinkham. Outside.

1000
00:57:45,943 --> 00:57:47,706
Do you know this dizzy dame?

1001
00:57:47,778 --> 00:57:51,339
Yeah, I still have nightmares about her.
She used to be my wife.

1002
00:57:54,051 --> 00:57:55,985
Still is, Chester, dear.

1003
00:57:56,854 --> 00:57:59,414
- You went to Reno.
- I was going.

1004
00:57:59,624 --> 00:58:02,650
- Somehow, I never got around to it.
- I see.

1005
00:58:03,227 --> 00:58:05,627
- You heard I was in the money.
- Exactly.

1006
00:58:05,997 --> 00:58:08,864
- What kept you away so long?
- I was in Europe.

1007
00:58:09,901 --> 00:58:12,734
- And who paid for that?
- That's my affair.

1008
00:58:12,803 --> 00:58:16,569
I understand you're all steamed up
about a Miss Vivian Rich.

1009
00:58:18,242 --> 00:58:21,473
- And what's that to you?
- I can make plenty of trouble.

1010
00:58:21,546 --> 00:58:24,913
- All right, come on, come on. How much?
- $25,000 worth.

1011
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:28,917
You might as well ask for $25 million.
I work for a living.

1012
00:58:28,986 --> 00:58:31,648
You can have till 4:00 this afternoon.

1013
00:58:34,659 --> 00:58:37,184
Then my lawyer and I start shooting.

1014
00:58:37,662 --> 00:58:39,152
Wait a minute.

1015
00:58:43,067 --> 00:58:45,228
Here's a pass for the cop at the gate.

1016
00:58:45,303 --> 00:58:48,170
I wouldn't want you to have
any trouble getting out.

1017
00:58:53,077 --> 00:58:54,305
$25,000.

1018
00:58:58,783 --> 00:59:00,910
Well, here's where I go to the cleaners.

1019
00:59:00,985 --> 00:59:03,146
Maybe I can do something about it.

1020
00:59:03,788 --> 00:59:06,985
You mean raise that dough?
What are you gonna do, print it?

1021
00:59:07,058 --> 00:59:08,491
Never mind. I've got an idea.

1022
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:10,618
Keep it to yourself
or the wife'll cash in on it.

1023
00:59:10,695 --> 00:59:13,596
And when I get an idea
I do something about it.

1024
00:59:18,069 --> 00:59:19,559
Most dames do.

1025
00:59:19,737 --> 00:59:23,138
<i>By a waterfall</i>

1026
00:59:23,207 --> 00:59:26,665
<i>I'm callng you</i>

1027
00:59:30,881 --> 00:59:32,246
I want to talk to Scotty.

1028
00:59:32,316 --> 00:59:35,513
You can't come in here
and break up my rehearsal this way.

1029
00:59:35,586 --> 00:59:38,919
- Mr. Kent's orders.
- Hold it! Come here, Scotty.

1030
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:43,384
Were you on the level
when you said that...

1031
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:45,326
Frazer and Gould
were holding out on Mr. Kent?

1032
00:59:45,396 --> 00:59:48,126
- You know Mrs. Gould, she talks a lot.
- Anything we can prove?

1033
00:59:48,199 --> 00:59:50,633
Just suspicions, but I sort of
put two and two together.

1034
00:59:50,701 --> 00:59:52,293
That's what I'm gonna do and make 25.

1035
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:53,997
Back to your places, girls!

1036
00:59:54,071 --> 00:59:56,164
- You've been gypping him for months.
- You're raving.

1037
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,868
No, just investigating.
And my knowledge is worth money.

1038
00:59:58,943 --> 01:00:01,309
It's out and out robbery
and that's a crime in any country.

1039
01:00:01,379 --> 01:00:04,348
- Lf our accountant made a mistake?
- Mr. Kent will let the jury decide.

1040
01:00:06,017 --> 01:00:07,609
<i>Bonjour,</i> darling.

1041
01:00:07,952 --> 01:00:11,251
Just got some tough news, Vivian.
My wife showed up.

1042
01:00:11,856 --> 01:00:13,721
You mean your ex-wife.

1043
01:00:14,392 --> 01:00:17,259
- My wife. She never got the divorce.
- What do you mean?

1044
01:00:17,328 --> 01:00:19,626
Now listen, baby.
It's just one of those things.

1045
01:00:19,697 --> 01:00:20,857
You've gotta be patient.

1046
01:00:20,931 --> 01:00:24,094
- Young lady, you're on the wrong track.
- What do you want?

1047
01:00:24,168 --> 01:00:26,659
To keep my mouth shut? $25,000.

1048
01:00:27,271 --> 01:00:28,329
Blackmail!

1049
01:00:28,406 --> 01:00:30,465
If I tell Kent,
he'll walk out and you know it.

1050
01:00:30,541 --> 01:00:33,669
- You can't bluff us.
- What makes you think I'm bluffing?

1051
01:00:34,545 --> 01:00:35,944
Young woman.

1052
01:00:36,647 --> 01:00:38,205
You see, darling, that's the way it is.

1053
01:00:38,282 --> 01:00:40,375
You promised to marry me
and you're going to marry me.

1054
01:00:40,451 --> 01:00:42,316
But I can't get rid of her.
She wants $25,000.

1055
01:00:42,386 --> 01:00:45,446
Listen, you silly-looking baboon,
who do you think you're running around?

1056
01:00:45,523 --> 01:00:47,388
- Some little punk from the sticks?
- What's this?

1057
01:00:47,458 --> 01:00:50,359
I wrote the book
and I know all the answers.

1058
01:00:52,129 --> 01:00:53,460
Well, well...

1059
01:00:54,498 --> 01:00:57,023
- The cultured Miss Rich.
- Not cultured, just smart.

1060
01:00:57,101 --> 01:01:00,093
Smart enough to sue
and attach everything but your garters.

1061
01:01:01,472 --> 01:01:03,269
That's nice to know.

1062
01:01:04,442 --> 01:01:05,431
Well...

1063
01:01:07,278 --> 01:01:10,008
I'd rather have you sue me than marry me.

1064
01:01:14,251 --> 01:01:16,651
Mr. Kent, there is a Santa Claus.

1065
01:01:17,488 --> 01:01:19,251
$25,000 and made out to you!

1066
01:01:19,323 --> 01:01:21,689
Endorsed to Chester Kent.
Take it and ask no questions.

1067
01:01:21,792 --> 01:01:23,726
There's something phony here.
How'd you get it?

1068
01:01:23,794 --> 01:01:25,455
- Blackmail.
- Come on, spill it.

1069
01:01:25,529 --> 01:01:29,021
I played a pair of deuces
like four aces and they paid.

1070
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,466
Frazer and Gould
have been holding out on me.

1071
01:01:31,535 --> 01:01:33,332
Bookkeeping mistake.

1072
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:36,636
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

1073
01:01:37,108 --> 01:01:38,575
Hello, Chester.

1074
01:01:38,642 --> 01:01:40,610
- So you double-crossed me.
- A book-keeping mistake.

1075
01:01:40,678 --> 01:01:42,407
I slave day and night for you.
What do I get?

1076
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,744
You stab me in the back!
Me, the guy who made this place!

1077
01:01:44,815 --> 01:01:46,976
Killed myself so you chuckle-headed apes
could get rich.

1078
01:01:47,051 --> 01:01:48,075
We'll straighten it out.

1079
01:01:48,152 --> 01:01:50,814
Go and get somebody else
to double-cross.

1080
01:01:51,455 --> 01:01:53,753
- What about Apolinaris?
- Stick him in your rear.

1081
01:01:53,824 --> 01:01:56,452
And that wood nymph prologue
has got no chance the way it stands.

1082
01:01:56,527 --> 01:01:59,985
- What do we do?
- Fix it yourselves, you two wonder men.

1083
01:02:00,931 --> 01:02:03,422
Chester!
Chester, you've gotta stay on the job!

1084
01:02:03,501 --> 01:02:05,833
You can't do this to us! Chester!

1085
01:02:05,903 --> 01:02:08,394
- Just a moment, you can't go out there.
- The orders are wrong.

1086
01:02:08,472 --> 01:02:09,734
Now wait a minute. Listen!

1087
01:02:12,276 --> 01:02:13,334
Cab!

1088
01:02:20,584 --> 01:02:23,382
- Where to, mister?
- Anywhere, just keep going.

1089
01:02:23,454 --> 01:02:25,319
- Let's go back, boss.
- For what?

1090
01:02:25,389 --> 01:02:26,981
They'll never get Apollo if you quit.

1091
01:02:27,057 --> 01:02:29,252
The three of them can open
a peanut stand together.

1092
01:02:31,829 --> 01:02:35,162
No! No! No! Wait a minute.

1093
01:02:35,399 --> 01:02:36,593
Try it again.

1094
01:02:36,667 --> 01:02:39,397
Hey, Mr. Francis, Kent has quit.

1095
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:40,960
- What?
- He can't do that.

1096
01:02:41,038 --> 01:02:43,336
He took the brains
on the drive with him under his hat.

1097
01:02:43,407 --> 01:02:46,706
I knew it couldn't be done.
I knew it couldn't be done.

1098
01:02:46,777 --> 01:02:48,267
Let's go home.

1099
01:02:51,982 --> 01:02:56,351
When Apolinaris hears, he wouldn't sign
if we gave him Garbo on roller skates.

1100
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:58,752
Prologues, prologues, prologues.

1101
01:02:59,323 --> 01:03:00,688
I'm fed up.

1102
01:03:00,891 --> 01:03:04,258
Fighting for ideas and chained
to that office, morning, noon and night.

1103
01:03:04,328 --> 01:03:06,956
And the third prologue, it's rotten.

1104
01:03:07,198 --> 01:03:08,722
But boss...

1105
01:03:10,601 --> 01:03:11,829
Pull up!

1106
01:03:21,212 --> 01:03:25,046
Hey, lend me that brush, will you?
Just a minute. Lend me that.

1107
01:03:31,922 --> 01:03:35,289
Hey, wait a minute! Hey!
Wait a minute! Hey, you!

1108
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:38,021
Wait, wait. Wait a minute.
What do you think you're trying to do?

1109
01:03:38,095 --> 01:03:40,063
That's my name
and I don't want it up there.

1110
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:42,428
- Yeah, you're full of hooch, are you?
- Let go.

1111
01:03:44,468 --> 01:03:45,935
Look at that.

1112
01:03:48,873 --> 01:03:51,205
That's what that
wood nymph prologue needs.

1113
01:03:51,742 --> 01:03:54,768
A mountain waterfall
splashing on beautiful white bodies.

1114
01:03:59,316 --> 01:04:02,513
- You get it?
- I have ideas, too, Mr. Kent.

1115
01:04:02,586 --> 01:04:05,020
- All right, well, come on!
- Yeah, come on.

1116
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:12,586
Sorry, gents. Without Kent
your prologues ain't worth a nickel.

1117
01:04:12,663 --> 01:04:14,221
He's coming back in a little while.

1118
01:04:14,298 --> 01:04:17,631
I can't wait very long.
I've got a date with the Gladstone.

1119
01:04:22,673 --> 01:04:25,870
Where do you think you're going?
Come on, get back in! Everybody back in!

1120
01:04:25,943 --> 01:04:27,205
Come on.

1121
01:04:29,246 --> 01:04:31,771
Hold everything. Everybody stand by.

1122
01:04:31,849 --> 01:04:34,010
Lock that gate. Nobody in, nobody out.

1123
01:04:34,084 --> 01:04:35,574
- Same as before?
- Same as before.

1124
01:04:35,653 --> 01:04:38,121
Listen, get back to work.
That third prologue has changed.

1125
01:04:38,188 --> 01:04:39,348
All the dance routines are shifted.

1126
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,549
Only this time, it's gonna be good.

1127
01:04:40,624 --> 01:04:42,387
I'll be with you in a minute.
Go on, get to work.

1128
01:04:42,459 --> 01:04:45,394
That's impossible, Mr. Kent.
It can't be done!

1129
01:04:45,462 --> 01:04:47,953
All right, children,
back to the rehearsal hall.

1130
01:04:48,032 --> 01:04:50,398
It can't be done. No, it can't be done.

1131
01:04:51,068 --> 01:04:52,899
Look, smallpox, I got the money.

1132
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:55,200
But I want a release.
Here, give her that when she signs.

1133
01:04:55,272 --> 01:04:58,332
I won't take a check.
You'll stop payment on it.

1134
01:04:58,409 --> 01:04:59,899
Throw her a herring.

1135
01:04:59,977 --> 01:05:01,808
Say, that gives me an idea.

1136
01:05:01,879 --> 01:05:04,347
How about shiny fish
jumping out of the water?

1137
01:05:04,415 --> 01:05:06,144
Swell. Come around Friday.

1138
01:05:06,216 --> 01:05:07,706
Say, listen...

1139
01:05:09,687 --> 01:05:12,053
What's this? I thought you quit!

1140
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:14,487
- Everything's off.
- It's on.

1141
01:05:14,558 --> 01:05:16,685
Here's your customer.
Got him on the way out. Hold onto him.

1142
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,159
Keep him here
if you have to tie an anchor to him.

1143
01:05:18,228 --> 01:05:19,320
I'll see you later.

1144
01:05:19,396 --> 01:05:22,058
- What about that accounting mistake?
- Mistake, your Aunt Fannie.

1145
01:05:22,132 --> 01:05:24,965
- We're giving you a new deal.
- Yeah, and I'm the dealer.

1146
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:27,630
Mr. Kent.

1147
01:05:28,906 --> 01:05:32,205
- Do you like to look at funny pictures?
- What do you mean?

1148
01:05:37,848 --> 01:05:40,339
I hope it looks as good as it sounds.

1149
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,694
Well, well, just folks.

1150
01:05:52,563 --> 01:05:54,724
Don't mind us.
We just dropped in for a laugh.

1151
01:05:54,798 --> 01:05:56,891
- This is all a mistake.
- Right, sister, and you're it.

1152
01:05:56,967 --> 01:06:00,733
I was just showing Miss Rich
what you can't do in Kalamazoo.

1153
01:06:00,971 --> 01:06:02,495
You won't need that lawyer.

1154
01:06:02,573 --> 01:06:05,133
Your breach of promise suit
is right in the ash can.

1155
01:06:05,209 --> 01:06:07,074
And you're my witness.

1156
01:06:10,914 --> 01:06:13,405
I certainly have a genius
for picking dames to fall for.

1157
01:06:13,484 --> 01:06:16,282
- You said it, papa.
- Maybe you better help me next time.

1158
01:06:16,353 --> 01:06:18,446
What do you think I've been doing?

1159
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:38,566
Mr. Kent, seeing all these girls
gives me a lot of ideas.

1160
01:06:38,642 --> 01:06:41,110
- And don't let them keep you awake.
- No.

1161
01:06:41,345 --> 01:06:44,314
Look, suppose I quit my job
and work for you?

1162
01:06:44,381 --> 01:06:47,282
Wait till Saturday.
I may be working for you.

1163
01:06:50,587 --> 01:06:54,216
Hold it! That's where your song comes in!

1164
01:06:54,291 --> 01:06:57,317
- How's Barrington?
- I'm a little worried.

1165
01:06:57,394 --> 01:06:59,123
Only a little worried? He must be colossal.

1166
01:06:59,196 --> 01:07:01,221
He is, but maybe he'll improve.

1167
01:07:01,298 --> 01:07:03,027
Well, you can start worrying
all over again.

1168
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,125
All the stuff you've done
in this prologue is out.

1169
01:07:05,202 --> 01:07:06,965
Here's the new stuff
and it goes on tonight.

1170
01:07:07,071 --> 01:07:10,973
No. No. This is the straw
that breaks the camel's back.

1171
01:07:11,075 --> 01:07:14,135
Mr. Kent, I cannot and I will not
try the impossible.

1172
01:07:14,211 --> 01:07:15,803
Come on, baby, wind yourself up.

1173
01:07:15,879 --> 01:07:19,371
After all, I'm only a human being.
I'm not a superman.

1174
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:22,112
And even if I were, it couldn't be done.

1175
01:07:22,186 --> 01:07:24,586
Mr. Kent, I resign.

1176
01:07:25,522 --> 01:07:27,717
I accept. You're through.

1177
01:07:27,791 --> 01:07:29,156
You accept?

1178
01:07:29,226 --> 01:07:32,127
Do you realize
that leaves me without a job?

1179
01:07:32,629 --> 01:07:35,826
And after I've worked myself
to the bone for you?

1180
01:07:35,899 --> 01:07:38,459
Come on, kids.
I'm putting this prologue on myself.

1181
01:07:38,535 --> 01:07:40,503
Line up. You're through.

1182
01:07:43,073 --> 01:07:44,870
All right kids, come on.

1183
01:07:48,579 --> 01:07:50,376
Come on, girls. Hurry, girls!

1184
01:07:50,447 --> 01:07:52,972
Hurry, please!
The bus leaves in 10 minutes.

1185
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:54,074
Will you hurry?

1186
01:08:22,212 --> 01:08:24,840
Come on, girls, hurry up! Step it up!

1187
01:08:28,218 --> 01:08:30,948
I ate my dinner too fast. I got indigestion.

1188
01:08:32,422 --> 01:08:33,684
Come on!

1189
01:08:35,959 --> 01:08:37,654
In here! In here!

1190
01:08:38,428 --> 01:08:40,487
Here, girls. Take it away!

1191
01:08:47,304 --> 01:08:50,501
<i>How am I to say what I want to say</i>

1192
01:08:50,574 --> 01:08:53,008
<i>In the proper way, my dear?</i>

1193
01:08:53,076 --> 01:08:56,068
<i>I'm not a gallant cavaler</i>

1194
01:08:56,613 --> 01:08:59,776
<i>But I'm sncere</i>

1195
01:09:00,217 --> 01:09:03,550
<i>So I'm gonna say what I have to say</i>

1196
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:06,350
<i>In the language of the day</i>

1197
01:09:06,423 --> 01:09:09,756
<i>You may have heard t all before</i>

1198
01:09:09,993 --> 01:09:14,487
<i>But here t goes once more</i>

1199
01:09:15,265 --> 01:09:17,961
<i>How about a lttle celebraton</i>

1200
01:09:18,802 --> 01:09:21,293
<i>To the jngle of a weddng bell?</i>

1201
01:09:22,072 --> 01:09:24,540
<i>How about a lttle reservaton</i>

1202
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:27,867
<i>At the Honeymoon Hotel?</i>

1203
01:09:28,645 --> 01:09:31,307
<i>Honeymoonng's gonna be my hobby</i>

1204
01:09:31,882 --> 01:09:34,510
<i>Don't you thnk a honeymoon s swell?</i>

1205
01:09:35,185 --> 01:09:37,779
<i>Wat untl we walk nto the lobby</i>

1206
01:09:37,855 --> 01:09:41,416

<i>There's a magc melody</i>

1361
01:27:45,474 --> 01:27:48,671
<i>Mother Nature sngs to me</i>

1362
01:27:48,744 --> 01:27:53,113
<i>Besde a waterfall wth you</i>

1363
01:28:21,043 --> 01:28:24,501
<i>There's a whppoorwll that's callng</i>

1364

<i>You-hoo-hoo-hoo</i>

1365
01:28:28,117 --> 01:28:32,577
<i>By a waterfall he's dreamng, too</i>

1366
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:39,625
<i>There's a magc melody</i>

1367
01:28:40,129 --> 01:28:43,792
<i>Mother Nature sngs to me</i>

1368
01:29:26,475 --> 01:29:28,875
- Did you like it, George?
- Tell you later.

1369
01:29:28,944 --> 01:29:30,639
Now I've got indigestion.

1370
01:29:30,713 --> 01:29:32,510
Well, so far so good.

1371
01:29:32,581 --> 01:29:34,776
Now this last prologue's up to you
and Joe Barrington.

1372
01:29:34,850 --> 01:29:37,011
- Where is Joe?
- He's waiting for us at the theater.

1373
01:29:37,086 --> 01:29:39,281
Don't worry, boss. Joe will do his best.

1374
01:29:39,355 --> 01:29:41,186
He'll have to do better than that.

1375
01:29:48,898 --> 01:29:50,195
Well, this tells the story.

1376
01:29:50,266 --> 01:29:52,131
Cheer up, boss.
Everything's gonna be all right.

1377
01:29:52,201 --> 01:29:54,999
You stick close to Apolinaris
and keep feeding him bicarbonate.

1378
01:29:55,071 --> 01:29:57,767
I've got to give Barrington a pep talk.

1379
01:29:58,474 --> 01:30:01,102
Hello, Mr. Apolinaris. Enjoying yourself?

1380
01:30:01,177 --> 01:30:02,974
I shouldn't have ate pie and salami.

1381
01:30:03,045 --> 01:30:07,277
- Oh, let me get you some bicarbonates.
- I just had some. Don't help me none.

1382
01:30:08,751 --> 01:30:11,117
Honey, how about a prologue honeymoon?

1383
01:30:11,187 --> 01:30:13,553
- I'll sign now.
- We'll make love in 40 cities.

1384
01:30:13,622 --> 01:30:16,557
And then start all over again.
If Apollo signs.

1385
01:30:16,625 --> 01:30:18,058
Well, he'd better.

1386
01:30:18,127 --> 01:30:20,721
Come on, girls! Come on!

1387
01:30:29,638 --> 01:30:31,230
Hello, Mr. Kent.

1388
01:30:36,145 --> 01:30:39,273
Come on, get with it.
You've got to get on here.

1389
01:30:39,381 --> 01:30:42,077
He was nervous
so I gave him a little drink.

1390
01:30:42,551 --> 01:30:43,813
Oh, yeah?

1391
01:30:47,256 --> 01:30:49,156
My regards to Thompson.

1392
01:30:56,065 --> 01:30:58,329
I can't do it. I tell you I can't.

1393
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:01,062
I've only appeared
in amateur performances.

1394
01:31:01,537 --> 01:31:03,402
- An amateur!
- Yes, sir.

1395
01:31:04,106 --> 01:31:06,233
Well, I might have known it.

1396
01:31:12,047 --> 01:31:13,571
That's our call, you go on.

1397
01:31:13,649 --> 01:31:16,083
If it's cold you go back
to that amateur league on crutches.

1398
01:31:16,152 --> 01:31:18,780
- I'm too nervous.
- Get on! Get out there and do it!

1399
01:31:18,854 --> 01:31:21,982
- I can't do it. I tell you I'm sick.
- I'll wrap this around your neck.

1400
01:31:26,729 --> 01:31:29,197
- What do you want to do, boss?
- Bring up that curtain!

1401
01:31:29,265 --> 01:31:31,790
Bring it up, Joe. Places, everybody!

1402
01:31:35,804 --> 01:31:36,998
All right, that's you!

1403
01:31:37,072 --> 01:31:39,563
- No, I can't! I won't go on!
- You better go on!

1404
01:32:05,868 --> 01:32:08,302
Looking for your Shanghai Lil?

1405
01:32:20,983 --> 01:32:23,508
No, she ain't your Shanghai Lil.

1406
01:32:32,528 --> 01:32:34,291
Don't give him flowers.

1407
01:32:34,363 --> 01:32:38,265
He'll just take your flowers
straight to Shanghai Lil.

1408
01:32:51,914 --> 01:32:54,382
No, I ain't seen Shanghai Lil.

1409
01:33:01,090 --> 01:33:04,787
Hello, Bailey, you old goon.
Where'd you get that monkey suit?

1410
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:07,761
Don't tell anyone you saw me
or I'll wrap you in the snoot.

1411
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:10,060
Hey, you jumped ship.
Now what's your game?

1412
01:33:10,132 --> 01:33:11,724
Just looking for a dame.

1413
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:14,132
- Staying here you're taking chances.
- Yeah?

1414
01:33:14,203 --> 01:33:16,433
Well, I'll stay just the same.

1415
01:33:19,441 --> 01:33:22,103

01:42:26,655 --> 01:42:28,520
I knew we could do it!

1517
01:42:29,191 --> 01:42:31,182
- You did it, boss!
- You mean we did it.

1518
01:42:31,259 --> 01:42:33,056
Come on, take a bow!

1519
01:42:43,004 --> 01:42:45,302
Let's go to my office.
I'll fill out the contract.

Take another bow.

I can't see, gentlemen.

01:42:59,955 --> 01:43:01,149
- For a unit?
- No, for you and me.

1527
01:43:01,223 --> 01:43:03,851
- Come on, take another bow.
- Take it yourself.

1528
01:43:05,327 --> 01:43:07,295
- You like it?
- Whatever you say, boss.

1529
01:43:07,362 --> 01:43:09,227
I'll make you love it.
