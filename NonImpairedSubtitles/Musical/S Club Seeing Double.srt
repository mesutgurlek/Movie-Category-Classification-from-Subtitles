00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,749
Oh, good

We got the record company first
We're gonna pick up some gold discs

8
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,555
Then we've got radio-station
interviews for the album promotion

9
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,271
press conference, then a photo
session for tomorrow's front page

10
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,954
And then finally, we have the gig

<i>Last day of the tour</i>
<i>Last day of the tour</i>

12
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,798
Thank you, Barcelona
Good night

13
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,396
Thank you very much
We'll see you next year!

14
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,236
You were brilliant tonight Brilliant
You, you, you All of you

15
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,868
Barcelona loves you
You are the real tortillas

16
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,473
You're right
We were pretty good

17
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,359
Water won't cut it now,
I'm gonna need plasma

18
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,512
Well done, guys
That was it, the last gig of our tour

19
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,269
So, Alistair, what are you
gonna do during our month off?

20
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,954
Because I'm going to the beach,
get a little tan

21
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,270
I'm gonna go back to London,
see my family

22
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,911
- go in the studio and chill out...
- Hold it Your what?

23
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,469
Our month off,
now that the tour's finished

24
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,713
A month, a week, a day
They all sound so similar, don't they?

25
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,838
- Alistair, you promised us
- You can't keep doing this to us

26
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,194
You promised us that month

27
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,354
Okay, okay Time off starts with a week
in LA, right after this press conference

28
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,589
- That's ridiculous
- What?

29
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,799
For the album It's a great album,
but you've got to promote it

30
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,878
Natalie, protein bars?

31
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,110
What are we gonna do?

32
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,433
- Why don't we fire him
- Who's gonna manage us, then?

33
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,155
Well, we could manage ourselves,
I suppose

34
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,993
And do loads of solo projects
that no one's gonna buy

35
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,390
And then you can marry
a footballer, Rach

36
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,516
And have loads of babies
with silly names

37
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,148
No, come on, guys
We've gotta stand up to him

38
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,912
Can't we do this in the morning?

39
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,551
No time Flight for Los Angeles leaves
at 7 am You can sleep on the plane

40
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,551
Come on Reporters are outside

41
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,995
Big smiles, energy,
eyes and teeth

42
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,873
Guys, look, I know it's tough, but
I promise you, it won't always be like this

43
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,748
One day, your records won't sell
The label will drop you

44
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,469
and even I won't return your calls

45
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,311
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
S Club

46
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,316
S Club, do you feel that your exposure
to the West Coast hip-hop scene

47
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,357
will be felt musically
on your next album?

48
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,669
- Yes
- No

49
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,558
- What she said
- What she said

50
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,597
How many of you girls
have had implants?

51
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,595
Me I had a cactus once,
but I watered it too much and it died

52
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,550
Do you see yourselves
as a manufactured band?

53
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,631
Do you see yourself
as a war correspondent?

54
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,119
What do you miss most
about being on the road?

55
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,430
- My dog
- Sunday roast

56
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,955
Tea with the queen Yeah

57
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,189
Bradley

58
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,592
Sorry, sorry, sorry What did you say?
I missed the question Sorry

59
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,511
Well, that wasn't so bad, now, was it?

60
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,352
We're having fun, aren't we?

61
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,273
A lot of people would love
to be in your shoes

62
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,675
Not in Jo's Her feet stink

63
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,037
- You all right?
- You said we was gonna have a holiday

64
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,395
Give me that

65
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,319
Get some sleep Up in three hours

66
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,753
" Up in three hours"

67
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,514
Alistair Beresford?

68
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,674
- That's me Have we met?
- Susan Sealov<i>e Enchantée</i>

69
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,478
<i>Enchanté</i>

70
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,230
Bloody hell!

71
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,989
Right, that's it Nobody move
I've got a gun

72
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,751
Guys, why is it so dark in here?

73
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,358
What are you lot doing down there?

74
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,875
Am I dreaming?
What's this big, hard thing?

75
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,155
- Jon
- Get off!

76
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,118
- Oh, sorry
- What is going on?

77
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,429
Look at the time!
We've missed our flight!

78
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,795
Alistair's gonna kill us!

79
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,953
- He checked out?
- We have a dress code

80
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,636
- Okay, did he leave a message?
- No message No <i>pijamas</i> in the lobby

81
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,395
A forwarding address? Anything?

82
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,273
This

83
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,869
It's the bill

84
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,830
I don't understand this
It's really not like Alistair

85
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,949
Can you believe the bill
was 2000 Euros?

86
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,675
- Why didn't he wake us?
- We upset him He's paying us back

87
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,034
We gave him a hard time

88
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,589
We always give him a hard time
He knows it's in fun

89
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,390
Maybe it's his idea of a joke to leave us
here stranded with no money or tickets

90
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,835
Well, what's funny about that?

91
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,436
Oh, yeah, that is funny,
on some level

92
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,272
I mean, 10 years on from now
when we look back, I'll be saying:

93
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,116
"Jo, do you remember the time
when Alistair abandoned us

94
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,317
and we went down to the lobby
in our <i>pijamas</i>?"

95
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,109
It'll be hilarious Really funny

96
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,353
If this is a joke, then it's on him
because we just got what we wanted

97
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,593
A day off

98
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,354
Guys?

99
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,998
- Guess what I found
- Well done, you, Rach

100
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,317
- Yes!
- Come on

101
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,794
High-five

102
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,232
This has been one
of the best days of my life

103
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,790
- Paradise Heaven on earth
- I'm creamed and steamed

104
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,191
Go ahead, feel my skin
No charge

105
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,319
- lf only we had just one more day
- Well, we haven't heard from Alistair yet

106
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,789
I mean, why can't we just stay here
until we do?

107
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,639
Well, don't look at me

108
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,349
Bradley gave the room-service girl
a 60 percent tip

109
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,476
It's all right

110
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,870
I can stick it back together
with my nail glue

111
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,918
Hannah, it's at its limit
Come on, guys, cough up

112
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,152
All right, what have we got?
What have we got?

113
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,670
After all that, we've got 2 Euros left
I think we're in trouble

114
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,310
Well, we're gonna
have to go back on tour

115
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,469
Right, what we'll do is, exchange
our tickets and book a flight Okay?

116
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,517
So who's got the tickets to LA?

117
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,831
Oh, well, that's Natalie
Natalie takes care of the tickets

118
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,595
Okay, so who's got her number?

119
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,389
So we're stranded

120
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,476
- I'm starting to panic
- No, you're not

121
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,916
I can't quite breathe properly

122
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,200
I'm not getting oxygen to my brain
I tell you, I'm hallucinating

123
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,839
I can see us on TV

124
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,677
It's Happening Now <i>live from</i>
<i>Los Angeles, California S Club</i>

125
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,989
When did we tape this?

126
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,069
Hang on a minute,
does my bum really look that big?

127
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,358
Well it's not taped, it's live Look

128
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,195
But that's impossible Where it says,
" live," that can't mean it's live

129
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,476
It can't mean it's happening now

130
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,916
- Excuse me, what show is this?
- It's called <i>It's Happening Now</i>

131
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,071
S Club

132
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:47,349
- Jo, my favourite
- That is not Jo I'm Jo

133
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,832
Hey, guys Look, there's Alistair
Don't you see?

134
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,037
He's got fed up with us whining
and moaning all the time

135
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,954
so he hired look-alikes in LA
He's trying to teach us a lesson

136
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,079
Well, we're gonna teach him a lesson
because he's fired, and that is it

137
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,151
How could he do this to us?

138
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,118
Especially as I lent him
my fluffy monkey slippers

139
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,834
- That's it He's fired
- Can we fire him?

140
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,798
I mean, we signed a contract

141
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,951
Yeah, but has anyone
ever read the contract?

142
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,554
Apparently, Alistair can make us
weed his yard

143
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,473
If he needs a kidney transplant,
one of us has to be the donor

144
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,234
I said we should have got a proper
lawyer instead of your uncle Peter

145
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,914
He knows the legal system
better than any other lawyer

146
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,077
Your uncle's an ex- Con

147
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,110
Oh, come on, you lot This is serious

148
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,796
We've gotta find Alistair
before this thing gets out of hand

149
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,037
Come on, Jon, quick
Lower, lower, lower

150
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,589
Lower That's it
Come on, come on

151
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,435
That's it That's it
All right, all right, I got it

152
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,991

Hannah?

154
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,435
Well, I'm not taking a suitcase
I'll look far too suspicious

155
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,599
Let me handle this, yeah

156
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,671
Please, my <i>hombre,</i>

- You pay the bill now?
- Yeah, just after we go for our short walk

158
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,115
- Walk?

159
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,114
You know, she's gotta lose a few stone
Doctor's orders Right

<i>Hello, can I help?</i>

162
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,229
- Yes! I think we handled that pretty well
- It was a piece of cake

163
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,119
S Club, you don't pay the bill

164
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,998
- First th<i>e pijamas,</i> now this

165
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,674
Yeah, we're just walking
You know, for exercise

166
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,231
With those?

167
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,312
Weight-training Come on, guys,

Yeah, do some squats

170
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,078
Arrest them

171
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,960
I'm really tired of this

172
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,797
I've had enough

173
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,997
We were gonna wire the money
to the hotel as soon as we got to America

174
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,596
- That's what Columbus said
- We haven't done anything wrong

175
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,479
- Been there, heard it
- Yeah, but we can explain

176
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,628
- Older than the oldest profession
- You're making a big mistake

177
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,559
Tell me something new

178
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,790
You can't arrest us
We're a famous band

179
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,032
If you let us go, I'll sign an autograph
and give you a copy of our new CD

180
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,510
That's what I was waiting to hear
You're the S Club? All of you?

181
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,390
- Yes
- Impersonating the S Club Fraud

182
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,279
- Impersonating?
- Anything else?

183
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,558
- We're not impersonators
- I've got the complaint right here

184
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,872
Signed by their manager,
Mr Beresford

00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,596
Open your eyes

188
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,914
- Alistair?
- You hit him too hard, Miss Sealove

189
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,631
Nonsense, doctor
Look, he's awake

190
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,554
Mr Beresford?

191
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,869
Don't try to move

192
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,670
There's someone
I'd like you to meet

193
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,440
Hello, handsome

194
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,591
Can I have a club sandwich
with no pickle?

195
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,479
I don't believe this
I can't get any reception in here

196
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,949
Hey! We know our rights

197

- Blood I'm gonna faint

199
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,192
No, no, my dear, it's not blood

200
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,955
They've been crushing grapes
in the warden's vineyard

201
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,430
If you give me 2 Euros,
I'll let you lick Armando's feet

202
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,192
He's got the biggest

Escape? My dear

206
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,157
this is the only prison in Barcelona
where people are trying to break in

207
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,838
But I can tell you,
the desk sergeant does like to dance

- Let's go to Natalie's

260
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,270
Okay, try around the other side

261
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,476
Guys, what took you so long?
The prison is right there

262
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,832
The scenic route was better

263
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,392
Guys, guys, guys
Natalie, please help us, all right?

264
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,232
We're fugitives
We don't know what to do

265
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,868
But you can't be here
You're in California

266
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,112
Look, you're booked to play
at the Fuller Center

267
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,236
Guys, we've got to get to LA

268
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,236
Tickets, passports

269
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,551
gum, earplugs, protein bars

270
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,912
neck rest, Game Boy and vibrating...

271
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,995
No, no! My last dollars and the address
of the place I rent when I'm in LA

272
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,069
- Bye Good luck Bye Bye, guys
- Bye

273
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,793
England!

274
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,756
England!

275
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,192
England!

276
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,271
Bradley, stop it!

277
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,079
Wait for me Come back!

278
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,676
Well, according to Natalie,
112 Whalecove View

279
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,358
is an attractive, sea- View property
with an alfresco dining area

280
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,348
This must be the place

281
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,030
Well, she said the keys
were under the flowerpot

282
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,351
Oh, great

283
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,998
Tina, you start on that side

284
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,596
I found it

285
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,276
We should go there
and kick those look-alikes right off-stage

286
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,919
What? And get arrested again?

287
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,957
According to Alistair,
we are the impostors

288
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,312
Maybe he's right
You know in that movie where

289
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,553
the robots are programmed to think
that they're people, but they weren't?

290
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,871
Well, maybe we're not actually us

291
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:54,113
Maybe they're us and we're them,
and we actually don't realise it

292
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,791
- You lost me at " hello"
- Okay, we'll just stick to the plan

293
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,752
Yes

294
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,710
We're gonna go in there, find Alistair

295
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,791
We're gonna have
a civilised conversation

296
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,912
And then we fire his butt,
and we kick it down the stairs

297
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,674
- Yeah
- Let's go

298
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,118
You lot stay here,
and we'll meet you after the show

299
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,352
- How much for the tickets?
- A hundred bucks from a scalper

300
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,671
- Each?
- I knew them when they were nobodies

301
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,472
Thank you

302
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,069
Thanks

303
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,638
- Screw you!
- Tina, wait Come back!

304
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,075
Can you give me
my microphone back, please?!

305
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,800
- Don't do that!
- Oy, give me my microphone!

306
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,713
It's my microphone!

307
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,036
Thank you

308
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,635
I'm sorry, but that girl was awful,
and everyone's gonna think she's me

309
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,752
That was no reason to jump on-stage,
grab her microphone and scream:

310
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,718
" Hello, Hollywood, it's great to be back"

311
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,830
It was like looking into a mirror

312
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,512
Maybe I had a twin, and we were
separated at birth

313
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,229
- I've actually always wanted a twin
- Yeah, or maybe they were robots

314
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,234
Or popbots

315
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,959
- Let's just stick with the twin thing
- Yeah

316
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,752
Let's go through this one more time

317
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,158
We find Alistair, and we have
a civilised conversation

318
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,189
- Wow, they really are identical
- No way, she's at least a size 14

319
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,997
I can't believe they walked
through without giving one autograph

320
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,436
Our fans are really gonna hate us now

321
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,428
- Bradley, I love you! No, wait! Bradley!
- Look, there's Alistair

322
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,592
Not now We're never gonna get
past those security guards

323
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,473
Come on, guys Let's just
follow the bus, all right?

324
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,315
- They're staying in a privat<i>e e</i>state
- Something's fishy

325
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,313
Yeah, that must have been
when we got thrown in that garbage

326
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,478
What I mean is, we never stay anywhere
this posh on tour

327
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,596
Well, why don't we just have a look

328
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,519
We could probably jump over
that wall or something

329
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,190
Who let the dogs out?

330
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,230
No, for real Look

331
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,037
I've got an idea

332
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,793

Repeat, wait for my command

This is Tough Sirloin
Meet me at the wall

356
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,869
Now, settle down Be quiet

357
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,515
I've got two friends I'd like you to meet

358
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,912
This is Mr Walker He's a naughty dog

359
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,274
And this is Rafferty He's a nice dog

360
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,353
Now, one day, Mr Walker
decided he wanted to go to the beach

361
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,436
So he got on his little spotty trunks,
and off he went Bye- Bye

362
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,559
Right, who's gonna go first, then?
Rach, you go

363
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,039
If I don't make it, will you tell my mum
I wanna be buried in my violet dress

364
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,796
Not the one I wore for my sweet 16,
but the one with the sandals

365
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,115
Now, Rachel

366
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,070
Okay, I can do this

367
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,510
Mr Walker's swimming trunks
were too small

368
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,430
because Mr Walker
had a big, fat tummy

369
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,237
- We can't make our way through that
- It's the only way of getting past the dogs

370
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,109
Stop, stop

371
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,755
Okay, Tina, come here

372
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,829
Okay, go, go, go!

373
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,715
Don't pay any attention to that

374
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,512
Do you wanna listen to my story or not?

375
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,559

410
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,595
- Why?
- Because I'm allergic to it

411

Hang on a minute
Has anyone seen my sweater?

434
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,592
No?

435
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,039
- Maybe we should have rung the doorbell
- Then I could have finished my story

436
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,998
Now I'll never know
what happened in th<i>e e</i>nd

437
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,952
I don't understand Alistair
Why is he doing this to us?

438
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,918
Well, we asked for time off
I guess we got it

439
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,113
Wait, he's replaced us with them,
so why don't we replace them with us

440
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,032
How?

441
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,035
We'll kidnap three of them
and switch places

442
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,949
Good luck, Rach

Security guards cannot have
dirty windows It restricts your vision

448
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,595
Could you shut the windows
so I can clean them?

- All right
- Thank you

00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,237
Anyway, better be off
Plenty more windows to clean, so

454
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,628
- All right

455
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,949
- Thank you
- No problem

456
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,031

457
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,879

458
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,680
- Okay, wait there
- Okay

459
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,318
Hi, Teen
I've got a nice bucket

460
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,116
I've always wanted to do that

461
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,876
Never mind that Just start stripping

462
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,392
What?

463
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,278
Hannah, there you are
Perhaps you could come over here

464
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,351
How nice of you to join us

465
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,274
Perhaps we could rehearse verse two
while we're still in our 20s

466
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,668
Good Playback

467
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,675
<i>Lately you've been searching</i>
<i>For the other side, side</i>

468
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,628
<i>There's a feeling to discover, baby</i>

469
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,839
<i>You can feel it in the air tonight</i>

470
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,873
<i>Let the groove just tak e you forward</i>

471
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,279
- Grab him
- Hey, hey!

472
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,040
<i>Let's mak e it tonight</i>
<i>Don't fak e it</i>

473
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,988
<i>There's no need to analyse</i>
<i>Now's the time to recognise</i>

474
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,038
- Are you ready?
- Yeah

475
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,838
Now, find out what you can

476
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,834
Meet us tomorrow
on Mulholland Outlook about, say, 1300

477
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,157
- Got it
- All right, I'll look after you I mean, him

478
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,320
- Okay
- Go Go, go, go, go

479
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,677
<i>Everybody</i>
<i>Dance</i>

480
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:16,719
<i>Let the music tak e you over</i>
<i>Dance</i>

481
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,549
<i>Let the beat become your lover</i>
<i>Dance</i>

482
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,796
<i>You can't stop it, baby</i>

483
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,509
And cut
Excellent work, everybody

484
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,757
I'll see you on set in five minutes
Final touches Thank you

485
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,879
Are you hungry?

486
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,519
I've got some toast and jam

487
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,797
If you give them toast and jam,
they'll want milk to wash it down

488
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,916
then they'll be asking
to use the loo

489
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,749
So we'll have no toast and no jam
We'll just talk

490
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,673
- So, what's your name?
- Rachel

491
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,400
What's your real name? Don't lie to me!

492
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,678
I'm Rachel

493
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,039
- Is this part of our training programme?
- Look, I'm asking the questions, all right?

494
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,513
What training programme?

495
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,431
This is a test

496
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,757
It's a good test

497
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,708
Do I tie you up now, Bradley?

498
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,993
We'll talk about it later

499
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,511
Come here, you guys

500
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,715
Either she's jerking my chain,
or they're all two slices short of a loaf

501
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,032
We might as well untie them
They're too dumb to escape

502
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,993
So, what's after dinner?

503
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,149
- Rehearse, of course
- What, every night?

504
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,795
- Performing is what we do
- Don't you ever just relax and hang?

505
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,194
Relax?

506
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,355
- Hang?
- No, no, no

507
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,590
I think what Hannah means is,
you know

508
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,190
we could just sit here
and talk and stuff

509
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,197
Exchange life stories and

510
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,234
we could discuss how we,
and by "we," I mean you

511
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,675
how you got here

512
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,310
and wher<i>e "</i>we," again that's you,
where we come from

513
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,950
And what "w<i>e"</i> hope to achieve

514
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,630
We are S Club We formed a band

515
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,438
We make records

516
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,795
We release records, and we tour

517
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,309
Great hang!

518
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,316
What do we do now?

519
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,791
Are you gonna eat that?

520
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,159
No

521
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,958
I've made tea

522
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,708
- Oh, thanks
- Enjoy

523
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,515
Did she just get you tea?

524
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,793
What? Biscuits as well

525
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,793
Tina, Tina

526
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,152
We gotta keep her
She's housebroken

527
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,912
You're a sick boy

528
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,593
What's all this?

529
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,718
SBB: Shower before bed

530
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,070
Shower before breakfast

531
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,308
SBB You must shower

532
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,156
No, no, no It's all right, honestly
I had one this morning

533
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,436
Just a " BB" Before breakfast

534
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,871
Fresh as a daisy, me

535
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,436
But go right ahead
You knock yourself out

536
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,114
Jon, I think the natives
are getting a bit suspicious

537
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,158
I don't care, Rach
These don't come off for anyone

538
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,231
unless they've bought me dinner first

539
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,436
For heaven's sake! Come on

540
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,511
Pretend you're in a JLo video

541
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,512
We're adults, aren't we?

542
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,989
We can handle this in a mature way

543
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,992
No time to be a shy guy, Jon

544
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,439
SBB Shower

545
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:08,273
<i>Just a shower of little droplets</i>
<i>Falling from the sky</i>

546
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,510
Bradley, don't use all the hot water
The rest of us want a shower too

547
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,592
<i>Scrub, scrub, scrub</i>
<i>Scrub, scrub, scrub</i>

00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,717
- Shower time
- Hang on a minute

552
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,869
You can't...

553
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,957
You can't do that

554
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,479
Wait, what are you doing?

555
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,910
Well, it's a small shower,
but we can all fit

556
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,156
Oh, right Well, then, you wash my back

557
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,231
and then, Rachel, I'll wash your back

558
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,439
and after that, we can turn around
and do the same again

559
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,959
Great

560
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,388
Now pass me the loofa

561
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,313
What are you doing? Get out
What are you doing in here?

562
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,999
That's sick, man!

Where's Jon?

566
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,113
We are required to shower together
to save on water

567
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,429
Well, who made that rule?

568
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,511
Alistair makes all the rules

569
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,154
Any breach of protocol
must be reported to Alistair

570
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,198
- Jon didn't breach any protocol
- Where is he, then?

571
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,638
He's right behind you

572
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,358
- Jon
- Hello, love

573
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,635
Watch out for that shirt

574
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,832
Yeah, it might get all wrinkly
in the shower

575
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:40,836
Jon, is it just me, or did you notice
something in the showers?

576
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,437
No, I did I'll admit it, Rach,
I looked

577
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,153
but hey, I still respect you

578
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,153
Jon, shut up, I'm being serious!
I'm talking about them!

579
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,117
They haven't got any bellybuttons

580
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,236
Jon, she's right

581
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,789
Look

582
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,836
Today was a good day

583
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,072
Keep this up and we shall
be ahead of schedule

584
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,790
Tomorrow, we have six hours
of rehearsals

585
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,792
- seven hours of interviews
- Thank you, Alistair

586
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,520

- Thank you

587
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,114
and an appearance
on <i>Totally Live Requests</i>

on how to be us

604
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,350
They're not look-alikes,
they're replacements

605

Guys, we have to get out of here
We've gotta warn the others

Look at them They're really quite sweet

607

Maybe they're robots

609
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,356
Or popbots

610
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,438
Well, personally, I think they're clones

611
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,511
It's not science fiction anymore, is it?

612
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,319
They've cloned sheep and goats
before, so why not a band?

613
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,832
You can't just clone someone
unless you've got a piece of them

614
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,670
like hair or fingernails or skin cells

615
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,034
The Internet!

616
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,629
Okay, here it is

617
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,870
One guy's been buying
all the S Club stuff

618
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,389
Victor Gaghan He bids on everything

619
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,471
Props, costumes, underwear

620
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,200
They've got our underwear
on the Internet?

621
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,637
Well, do a search on him

622
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,717
A genetics professor
at Golden State University

623
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,075
" Fired for illegal cloning experiments"

624
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,872
That's the guy!

625
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,594
Hello How are you?

Hello, little one

638
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,712
Could I take a look
at Rachel's autograph?

639
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,354
Thank you

640

643
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,556
S Club have done what?

644
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,149
Do it like that

645
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,754
This is the Rolf Harris technique,
and it'll come back

646
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,114
They're late

647
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,068
They are not late, and will you stop
pacing? You're making me nervous

648
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,910
Well, I've shown them
the Tasmanian swing

649
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,310
And Jon's got the hang of it

650
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,593
Look at them They're just so content

651
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,360
That's because they're bores
and boomerangs are boring

652
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,192
It's a perfect match

653
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,199
If I'd have known you could
make that from my underwear

654
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,839
I would never have worn any

655
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,150
But they're not bores, are they?

656
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,029
They just don't want anything

657
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,997
They don't have to worry
about anything

658
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,348
They just exist

659
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,636
Kind of creepy, though, ain't it?

660
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,315
I don't know, it's like they're not human

661
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,711
Oh, it's up in the tree

662
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,397
- Boomerang
- Boomerang

663
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,190
- I don't think it's coming back anymore
- But Tina said it would

664
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,239
Can you see Alistair?

They must know something

They think they're S Club
What could they know?

Well, supposing we told them the truth?
The shock might jog their memory

Truth?

737
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,997

Manufactured in a lab

- Or cheerleaders

01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,913
- Fake boobs
- Yeah, I just said, cheerleaders

747
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:20,673
We're the real S Club

748
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:24,157
You've been brainwashed
with a personal history

749
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:27,118
- That would explain the gaps
- Gaps?

750
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:30,869
Well, yeah Whenever I pass
a shoe store, I get really excited

751
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,871
- But I don't know why
- Oh, for pity's sake

- Where's Victor Gaghan?
- Who?

or goodbye to your heads

01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,877
Look, just try and remember
Where did you first meet?

01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:49,868
- I met Jon at an audition
- That's what you was programmed to say

757
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,395
Come on, think about it Think

758

Jon

759
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,991
do you remember the lights?

760
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,951
We were in a cave

761
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,348
A big, colourful cave

762
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,871
And we were all there

763
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,109
- Papa
- Where are you?

764
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,518
I can't remember

765
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,312
Peak

766
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,196
It was called " Eagle Peak"

767
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,359
Get off me! Let me go!

768
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:20,549
This, my little pop chums,
is th<i>e e</i>nd of the line

769
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,674
This isn't just Alistair's way
of getting back at us

770
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,159
This is bigger than that

771
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:38,269
Okay, so we've been captured by a man
who's built a dungeon in his basement

772
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,955
Now, that's not good

773
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,639
Sit down

774
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,555
All right

775
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,399
Now, let's not have any trouble here

776
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,391
- Give me your hand
- Who are you?

777
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,036
Oh, no, please don't cut my fingers off
I need those...

778
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,278
Oh, right, a fingernail

779
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,630
Oh, okay, you can have one of those

780
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,872
Actually, could you cut that one?

781
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:16,072
Because that one's really snagging
on my jumpers

782
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,715
- I'll give you a tip
- Not necessary

783
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,270
But I have a tip for you,
Miss Smarty Pants

784
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,633
Say your prayers

785
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,069
What did that mean?

786
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,352
Don't you see? Gaghan's gonna
clone us again from our fingernails

787
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:39,632
Yeah, he's got what he wants now
He doesn't need us here anymore

788
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,993
He's gonna kill us!

789
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,390
We can't just go on our own
We need backup

790
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,198
Okay, go and call the LAPD

791
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,079
Tell them an evil scientist cloned us
and had them do gigs

792
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,589
I'll come and visit you in the loony bin

793
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:09,038
Eagle Peak Let's rock 'n' roll, baby

794
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,869
We'll come with you

795
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,518
- We can't trust you
- Yes, you can

796
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,514
Alistair lied to us We're feeling really

797
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,032
- Angry
- Yes!

798
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,191
- We want
- Revenge

799
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,879
Yes!

800
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,595
- I'm sorry, it's too dangerous
- We're not afraid

801
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:35,995
To sum up, we're angry, we want revenge,
we're not afraid and can kill if necessary

802
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,115
Wait

803
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,873
- We're still on the same team, right?
- Yeah

804
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,438
All right Let's go

805
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,189
All right

806
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,749
First, we'll short-circuit
th<i>e e</i>lectrical current

807
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,353
then bypass the video input

808
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:26,308
Then freeze the computer- Identification
system, and if that don't work

809
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,675
then we'll just chuck Hannah
over the gate

810
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,033
- It's a retinal scanner
- Rectal scanner?

811
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,236
Well, every castle has one
of those, don't they?

812
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,437
No, Hannah, a retinal scanner

813
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,831
Look, this is gonna take forever
Why don't we split up into two groups

814
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,991
You go and find Jo,
Bradley and Tina

815
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,674
and we'll try and find Rachel,
Hannah and Jon

816
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,479
We're here
You found us

817
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:25,997
And we found you
That was so easy

818
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,877
Jo, this is your idea

819
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:53,911
- No! It was Bradley
- My back

820
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,470
You guys okay?

821
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:02,870
Wait a minute
Where's Bradley?

822
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,758
He's there

823
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:09,198
- What happened?
- You got hit by a pillow Come on

824
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,873
Nice try

825
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,752
but we can't let you escape

826
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,751
Grab them

827
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,032
There you are

828
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:50,557
Admiring my collection of genetic matter
from the dearly departed?

829
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:55,117
- But Tom Green isn't dead
- A man can dream, can't he?

830
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:59,636
So you're the guy who bought
the knickers off the Internet?

831
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:05,148
Yes I wanted to meet you all in person
before I tied up the loos<i>e e</i>nds

832
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,194
You must be wondering
why I brought you here

833
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,471
I used to have heroes

834
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,639
stars who I'd write to

835
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:18,590
but who never replied,
because I didn't count

836
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,873
I was beneath them

837
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:28,310
Then I realised
I can grow my own stars

838
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,270
Programme them to obey me,
do whatever I say

839
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:36,951
- So I started collecting their DNA
- But it doesn't make any sense, though

840
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:40,396
If you want power, then why not clone
people like Bill Gates or President Bush?

841
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:43,433
You can take over the world
with clones of that calibre

842
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,358
Tell me

843
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,878
who would you rather see stepping
naked out of an accelerated growth pod

844
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,640
Bill Gates or Britney Spears?

845
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,671
- Britney
- Britney Definitely

846
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,712
Thank you

847
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,917
As for controlling the world,
do you really think

848
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:06,154
people are interested
in politicians or corporate moguls?

849
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,238
The subtle influence
that captures the minds

850
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:14,235
and hearts
of the young is music

851
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,517
The future lies

852
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,717
in music

853
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:23,919
And I own that future

854
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:28,232
Of course, I'm only telling you this
because you'll be dead in five minutes

855
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:32,117
- Do you wanna know how?
- I'd actually rather be surprised

856
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,118
The floor will fall away,
dumping you into a pit

857
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:40,189
full of lethally poisonous
snakes and spiders

858
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,789
You don't scare us

859
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:45,435
What are you talking about?
Yes, it does

860
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,319
Actually it's more the
spiders than the snakes

861
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,630
No, no, no
It's definitely the snakes

862
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,635
Shut up

863
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:59,708
There is nothing more powerful than
an idea whose time has come

864
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,599
Your time, however, is gone

865
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,992
Goodbye, S Club

866
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,716
Look, I don't understand
We're S Club

867
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:17,829
No, we're fake boobs
The real S Club are in there

868
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,475
This looks familiar

869
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,359
It's just like I remember it

870
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:42,997
It's no use struggling

871
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,469
The doctor is a genius

872
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:51,510
He's calculated all the odds, run all the
scenarios, envisioned every outcome

873
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:55,593
There's absolutely nothing
that can save you now

874
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,118
Stop that!

875
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,834
- There you are
- Stop that right now Obey me!

876
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:09,316
- We're rebelling If that's all right
- It's not all right

877
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,750
Get back to the castle!
It's rehearsal time

878
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,757
- No way
- That's my girl

879
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:18,710
- You lied to us, Alistair
- Yeah, we're just fakes Copies Clones

880
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,958
Is that what they told you?

881
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:24,680
Don't you see?
They're jealous

882
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,558
They want to replace you

883
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,553
- You mustn't trust them
- Don't listen to him

884
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,197
You must trust me
I wouldn't lie to you

885
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,272
- Maybe he's right
- No, he isn't

886
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,431
Come on, follow me

887
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,232
Wait

888
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,433
Alistair!

889
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,670
He's a clone

890
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,877
What? Wow

891
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,474
Look at that, a built-in M&M holder

892
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:57,558
By the way,
can I have my clothes back now?

893
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:05,073
<i>For lunch today there is meat loaf,</i>
<i>broccoli spears, followed by</i>

894
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,549
<i>humble pie, limp biscuit</i>
<i>and vanilla fudge</i>

895
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,029
<i>Vanilla ice cream</i>
<i>and cream for dessert</i>

896
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:13,112
<i>Lights out at 10:30 tonight, apart</i>
<i>from Marilyn Manson</i>

897
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,589
<i>who wants</i>
<i>to sleep with the lights on</i>

898
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,149
<i>The bedtime story</i>

899
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,038
<i>It will be</i> Little Red Riding

900
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,998
Tina There's hundreds of them

901
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:30,754
<i>Would Madonna please report to the</i>
<i>music room for extra singing lessons?</i>

902
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,194
Holy cloned cow

903
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:42,157
Is that Posh Spice over there
eating a steak and kidney pie?

904
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,476
Well, that proves
she's not the real thing

905
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:48,519
And look, there's Robbie Williams
having a food fight with Eminem

906
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:52,150
And Ozzy Osbourne I can't believe
they cloned Ozzy Osbourne

907
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,040
No
That's the real Ozzy Osbourne

908
01:14:55,240 --> 01:15:00,030
Victor never cloned him
He's a mad scientist, but he's not insane

909
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:02,556
All you, look

910
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,593
We've got something to show you

911
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:19,349
Spit it out, boy
What about the clones?

912
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:22,398
<i>They're rebelling, Dr Gaghan</i>

913
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,269
Damn!

914
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,438
- Lf we leave here, how will we survive?
- Form tribute bands

915
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,239
- You can go on <i>Pop Idol</i>
- The point is

916
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:36,035
there's a whole life out there
beyond those gates A whole world

917
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:38,998
A whole world where you can do
what you want, not what you're told

918
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,675
A whole world of fun and freedom

919
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,997
You can throw a plastic boomerang
whenever you want

920
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:49,239
And there's potatoes cooked
in hot grease and sugar Good, right?

921
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:52,756
Look, all you need
to say is, " I'm tired..."

922
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:56,071
Not so fast

923
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:00,116
So go back to your rooms

924
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,794
Anyone who disobeys me will be killed

925
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:13,117
We'll have to make an example
of someone, I suppose

926
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,038
Get that one

927
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:20,878
No, get off me

928
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:26,114
If you kill her,
you have to kill me first

929
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:28,316
- And me
- And me

930
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:29,914
- And me
- And me

931
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,673
- And me
- And me

932
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,199
- And me
- And me

933
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:36,949
- We may need extra backup
- It's over

934
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,678
Plan Q

935
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:42,389
Isn't that " nuke Fort Knox
and ruin the world's economy"?

936
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,757
No
Plan Q:

937
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,480
Destroy th<i>e e</i>vidence

938
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:52,315
Blow this entire building to oblivion

939
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,030
Pull the switch

940
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,752
<i>Three minutes to destruction</i>

941
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,678
<i>All clones remain calm</i>

942
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,789
In three minutes, all of you

943
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,551
will be destroyed
along with this facility!

944
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,155
<i>- Two minutes, 52 to destruction</i>
- What are we gonna do?

945
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:23,158
Don't panic, all right
I've seen this bit a zillion times

946
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,675
The hero always saves the day

947
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:29,595
- Okay, so where are the heroes?
- We're the heroes, you mook

948
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:31,234
We've got three minutes

949
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,715
Hold up
Time- Out, time- Out

950
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:38,357
Why do we always get three minutes?
Why can't we get an hour? Why?

951
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,113
<i>We've been living a lie</i>

952
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:46,069
<i>We're not what we seem to be</i>

953
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:49,238
<i>And we've had enough of being fooled</i>

954
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,516
<i>And now we wanna be free</i>

955
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,592
<i>Yeah, we've been living a dream</i>

956
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,028
<i>Somebody else's</i>

957
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,708
<i>And now we wanna live ours</i>

958
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,354
<i>But we got to leave this game behind</i>

959
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,754
<i>To know who we really are</i>

960
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:10,316
<i>Don't let anyone tak e over your life</i>
<i>No, no, no</i>

961
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:13,472
<i>Don't give up your dreams</i>
<i>And you'll be all right, no, no</i>

962
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:17,229
<i>They think they can control you</i>
<i>But they should have told you</i>

963
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:20,557
<i>When you're a clone</i>
<i>You know you're never alone</i>

964
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:23,115
<i>Who</i>

965
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,117
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

966
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,515
<i>Do you know for sure?</i>
<i>Now tell me</i>

967
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,312
<i>Who</i>

968
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,758
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

969
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:35,032
<i>Do you know for sure?</i>
<i>Now tell me</i>

970
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,876
<i>Two minutes, six to destruction</i>

971
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:43,878
<i>We're ready for change</i>

972
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:47,390
<i>And we just want to come out</i>

973
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:50,677
<i>And it's up to you and me now, boy</i>

974
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,030
<i>Why are we waiting around?</i>

975
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,111
<i>Feels lik e we're caught in a trap</i>

976
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,912
<i>Somebody else's</i>

977
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:00,350
<i>Maybe it's all in the mind</i>

978
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:04,357
<i>But we've gotta find a way to leave</i>

979
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,437
<i>All of this trouble behind</i>

980
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:11,273
<i>Don't let anyone tak e over your life</i>
<i>No, no, no</i>

981
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:14,679
<i>Don't give up your dreams</i>
<i>And you'll be all right, no, no</i>

982
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:18,674
<i>They think they can control you</i>
<i>But they should have told you</i>

985
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,636
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

986
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,831
<i>Do you know for sure?</i>
<i>Now tell me</i>

987
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,996
<i>Who</i>

988
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,436
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

989
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,676
<i>Do you know for sure?</i>
<i>Now tell me</i>

01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,513

01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:50,231
<i>Do you know for sure?</i>
<i>Now tell me</i>

996
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,431
Quick
To the helicopter!

997
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,676
<i>One minute, six to destruction</i>

998
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,233
<i>Just gotta get, just gotta get back</i>

999
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,637
<i>Just gotta get, just gotta get back</i>

1000
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,114
<i>38 seconds to destruction</i>

1001
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,595
<i>Who</i>

1002
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,438
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

1003
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,073
<i>Do you know for sure?</i>
<i>Now tell me</i>

1004
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:12,596
- Go! Go!
- Victor, no!

1005
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,199
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

1006
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,391
<i>Do you know for sure?</i>
<i>Now tell me</i>

1007
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:19,308
<i>Who</i>

1008
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:21,471
We're free!

1009
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:23,591
<i>Do you know for sure?</i>
<i>Now tell me</i>

1010
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,990
<i>Who</i>

1011
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,593
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

1012
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:28,915
<i>Four, three</i>

1013
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,714
<i>two, one</i>

1014
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:35,156
<i>- Plan Q aborted</i>
- I think we've done it, guys

1015
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,276
We've freed the clones

1016
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,908
We've just released
a whole new set of Britneys

1017
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,436
*NSYNCs and Nelly Furtados
into the world

1018
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,830
Maybe we should be quiet about that

1019
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,314
Nobody move!

1020
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:52,110
I want my S clones back
They obeyed my every command

1021
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:56,717
They were always on time, and they
only needed one toilet break a week

1022
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:59,878
They were the perfect band

1023
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,269
Alistair!

1024
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:10,750
Okay, put me down, S Club
I'm sorry!

1025
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,717
- Natalie
- Hey, welcome to Hollywood

1026
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,599
You are not gonna believe
what's been going on

1027
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,114
Bye

1028
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,038
Bye, Rach

1029
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,838
Come here

1030
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,795
I'm gonna miss you, you know

1031
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,758
I've never met anyone
like you before

1032
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:04,593
Well, not anyone with a bellybutton

1033
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:07,593
Where are you gonna go?
What are you gonna do?

1034
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,591
I'll get along

1035
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:21,993
What the...?

1036
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,991
Bradley, that is disgusting

1037
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:30,989
- What are you doing? She's me
- No, it's not

1038
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,991
She's all right
I mean, she made me tea

1039
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:35,355
It doesn't mean I fancy you
I don't fancy you at all

1040
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:37,755
- That goes for me too
- Come on, you lots, stop bickering

1041
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:40,395
We'd better get going
We've got a big tour ahead of us

1042
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:42,631
- Natalie
- All right

1043
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,917
Now, we've got radio interviews
at 8 sharp tomorrow

1044
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,475
- Tuesday, San Diego Wednesday, Detroit
- Oh, no

1045
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,996
Thursday, New York
Friday, Washington

1046
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:52,149
Saturday, Kansas City

1047
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,269
- Wait!
- Wait!

1048
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,635
- Hey!
- Wait!

1049
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:01,509
- Come back! We need you!
- We need to talk!

1050
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:18,995
They're doing fine You know, they're
almost as good as the real thing!

1051
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,953
Cool
All right, take care

1052
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,709
Guys, Alistair says the S Club
are doing better than ever

1053
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:29,108
I think he's right as well

1054
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:32,757
I mean, Jon, for me,
really is the star of the show

1055
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,190
- I feel a bit guilty about this
- Well, don't

1056
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:39,233
They'll get time off when we go on
It's so perfectly fair

1057
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,231
Well, I think everyone
should have a clone

1058
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,038
People would just be
so much better off

1059
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:46,557
I just meant that they're
getting paid in boomerangs

1060
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:49,996
You've got to admit, the clones are
all right, though, aren't they?

1061
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:54,428
Aren't they, Rach?
They're all right

1062
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:59,112
- You know that already, right?
- Go on, Rachel

1063
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,478
This is ridiculous

1064
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,392
I want you to mean it,
"This is ridiculous"

1065
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,516
This is ridiculous

1066
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:28,511
Bradley

1067
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,509
- We can't trust you
- Yes, you can

1068
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:37,589
Alistair lied to us
We're feeling really

1069
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:42,756
- And we're feeling...
- Cut

1070
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:44,952
- Help!
- Help!

1071
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,839
- Louder " Help!"

1072
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,554

1073
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:57,677
Ready

1074
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,558
Hannah?

1075
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,838
Yeah, but

1076
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,911
- Sorry
- Cut

1077
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,239
Well, my name's actually Jonathan,
but everyone calls me Jon

1078
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,152
That's just J-O-N, no H

1079
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,872
One more time, Jon

1080
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:18,550
Guys, Alistair says the S Club
are doing better than ever

1081
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,870
I think he's right

1082
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:25,033
Sorry, I can't remember the line if I don't
do "you know, you know, you know"

1083
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:31,590
- I've got to get out of jail!
- Action

1084
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:33,711
Jo from Essex

1085
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:36,394
And cut

1086
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,150
Look, this is gonna take forever
Why don't we split into two groups

1087
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,231
You three...

1088
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:50,591
Look, this is gonna take forever
Why don't we split up into...

1089

One more time
Cut!

01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:57,432
I want my dinner!

1091
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:01,309
- " I want my dinner!"
- I want my dinner!

1092
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:02,873
And action!

1093
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,554
- What is your name?
- Tina

1094
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:12,319
We can't just go up there on our own
We need backup

1095
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:16,957
Go and phone the LAPD
Tell them that a mad scientist has...

1096
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:21,238
I want my life back!

1097
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:25,110

Try Try

1099
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,755
I don't like that

1100
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:42,028
Where's Jon? We are required
to shower together to save on water

1101
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:46,830
- Well, who made that rule?
- Alistair makes all the...

1102

- Oh, yeah Yeah, bring it on

1103
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:53,759
Cut!

1104
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:07,554
- Did you slip her the tongue?
- Well, you know

1105
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,672
- Pose
- What's up?

1106
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:15,358
Come on

1107
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:18,512
And another pose
Cut!
