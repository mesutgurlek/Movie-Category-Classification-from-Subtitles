1
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:37,430
''These moments, these memories,
l'll cherish for years to come''

2
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:45,039
''Should these seasons go away,
l'll complain''

3
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:52,875
''l'll remember these moments
for years to come''

4
00:00:53,386 --> 00:01:00,053
''lf these seasons go away,
l'll complain''

5
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,475
Don't they suffer the heat, Daija?

6
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,675
Stop the car.
-Why Daija?

7
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,145
What are you doing?

8
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:34,853
Come. You also get down.

9
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:37,830
Get down.

10
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:43,129
But it's a desert!
- Bow to this land.

11
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,732
Bow? What for?

12
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:49,136
Because you're here
for the first time.

13
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,370
This is the threshhold
of your house.

14
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:55,147
Won't just folding my hands do?
The ground must be very hot.

15
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,945
Okay, okay, don't look like that.

16
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,554
l said, bow to it.

17
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,468
Sit down, sit down. There is no escape
from this.

18
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,443
You used to pine for this desert
out there?

19
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,880
This is not just a desert.

20
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:31,515
Just look around, it's full
of your family's legends

21
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:36,988
Legends don't have to bear the heat.
Else, they'd get a sun-stroke too!

22
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,221
Keep quiet.

23
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:45,190
Just see, they are sitting as though
this desert is air-conditioned!

24
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,666
What stuff are these
people made of?

25
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,935
They are made out of
the local soil.

26
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:53,603
They're as seasoned as
the tree above them.

27
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:59,541
Papa migrated before
l was born, else...

28
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,215
When this sun seasons you too
in a couple of days,...

29
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,479
and when it narrates to you the
unlimited legends of your ancestors...

30
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,487
you too will be happy.

31
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,126
After signing the papers,...

32
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:20,232
l'll catch the first flight
to London.

33
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,735
As you command.

34
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:26,499
Don't use that tone with me, please.
l feel as though you're scolding me!

35
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,774
l am scolding you!

36
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:34,903
Okay, l'll do my work,
bow to the land...

37
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,250
seek your permission,
then go away. Happy?

38
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,720
Forget all that for now.

39
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:46,650
Your talk has moved the
mansion itself to hug you!

40
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:06,340
Greetings - Greetings - Greetings
- Greetings - Come, Let's go.

41
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,195
His Lordship has
certainly grown up!

42
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,088
This is the caretaker
of this place. Mr. Tiwari.

43
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,698
What's all this farce?
- Tradition, son.

44
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:40,307
Your father went abroad, but your
parents' portraits hang here.

45
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,648
Parents don't have feet,
you see...

46
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,485
Can l remove this garland now?

47
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,247
Our neighbour, Mr. Thakur is here. -Okay.

48
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,760
Who is he?

49
00:04:55,361 --> 00:05:00,890
He's not just a neighbour, but
a very good friend of your father.

50
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:05,895
When the world had deserted him,
this man stood firmly by him.

51
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,202
Don't just greet him casually,
but bow to him,...

52
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,637
and address him respectfully, come.

53
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:36,363
When kids grow, their place is not
at one's feet. lt's in one's heart.

54
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:46,368
l've come here after 18 years today.
Just to embrace you, son.

55
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,552
l don't commit a faux pas, did l?

56
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,991
No. You just reminded him
of your father.

57
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:09,731
And the proud local men and women
don't let their tears be seen.

58
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,927
Come, l'll show you your room.

59
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:28,477
Y

60
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:36,791
''O dear clouds...''

61
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,731
''O dear clouds''

62
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,842
''Your heart is definitely yearning,
the way you're showering...''

63
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:58,739
''whom have you fallen
in love with?''

64
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:14,029
''O dear cloud...''

65
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:01,413
''My state is
somewhat like yours''

66
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:06,410
''Your state is
somewhat like theirs''

67
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:24,702
''Drench me in rains, O clouds''

68
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:28,437
''for someone has
uttered my name''

69
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,461
''O dear clouds...''

70
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:57,464
''O dear clouds''

71
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,065
''Tell us his name...
- No''

72
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,204
''Where does he live?''

73
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:07,212
''ls he a prince...?
Tell us''

74
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,652
''Spring has set in;
flowers blossom''

75
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:22,159
''Spring has set in;
flowers blossom''

76
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:40,511
''My friends say things that
make me blush; lower my gaze...''

77
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:50,511
''O dear clouds''

78
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,564
''Why am l longing?
Why is it raining?''

79
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:45,735
''Whom am l missing?''

80
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,582
''Why am l yearning...?''

81
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,991
What are you thinking of, son?

82
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,926
Of you.

83
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:11,066
Of me? l'm a thing of the past now.
Think of the days to come.

84
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,600
Don't avoid the issue.
You brought me to my home.

85
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,735
But surely you have a home too.

86
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,944
You haven't talked about it
till today.

87
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:22,347
Yes. And that's strange, isn't it?
l had totally forgotten.

88
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:29,619
You have reminded me that l too
had a home once.

89
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:37,159
but so much time has gone by...
that l didn't even think of it.

90
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,033
lt's only your voice
that echoes in my ears.

91
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,229
May you live long, son.

92
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:13,492
''These moments, these memories,
l'll cherish for years to come''

93
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:21,101
''And if these seasons change,
l'll beg for them''

94
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:28,770
''These moments, these memories,
l'll cherish for years to come''

95
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:36,119
''And if these seasons change,
l'll beg for them''

96
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:48,857
Y

97
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:29,733
''From these glimpses
of my dreams...''

98
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:37,846
''from the bondage l share
with my memories...''

99
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:47,515
''how will l ever
set my heart free?''

100
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:55,090
''And if these seasons change,
l'll plead for them''

101
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,528
''These moments...''

102
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,272
What's the matter with you?

103
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,668
Nothing.

104
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:10,308
Do you remember that small boy
who used to tell me everything?

105
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,880
There's nothing to tell.

106
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,609
Then why are you sitting
in the dark like this?

107
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,481
l just thought somebody
would put the light on...

108
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:22,485
And suppose l hadn't, would you
have gone on sitting? Anyway...

109
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,590
you have to go to a dinner
at Mr. Thakur, remember?

110
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,899
l'm not in the mood.

111
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,565
lt's you who is invited,
not your mood.

112
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,699
You'll have to go. Come on.

113
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,640
Come my son, may you live long.

114
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,078
l can't tell you how happy l am
to see you here.

115
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,608
What happened?

116
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,407
Son is it burning too much?

117
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,749
lt's nothing serious.

118
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:28,949
You're great! lf l was in your shoes,
l'd have screamed this place down.

119
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:33,291
What's the fun in burning
without making a noise?

120
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,467
You know my name?

121
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,470
See what he's asking?

122
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:47,468
Whether you know us or not,
everybody out here knows you.

123
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,978
You're his Lordship from London.
And who am l?

124
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,985
l'm Pallavi.
- What are you...

125
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,584
And this uncle of yours,
l'm his only daughter.

126
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:03,757
Now don't say you're happy to meet me,
for it's all said and done.

127
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,329
You really made me wait.

128
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,730
Now he'll say,
he had a telephone call.

129
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:16,001
Sorry, but l got a call.

130
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:22,173
Just as l was through with that,
l got another call.

131
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,010
Just as l finished,
l got a call from the S.P.

132
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:31,814
l'm fed up with this telephone.
l think l'll have my line cut.

133
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,757
l'm really fed up with all this.
l'm thinking of having it disconnected.

134
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:41,828
He's a first class liar!
He's always like this.

135
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:47,027
And the funniest part is, everyone
knows he has no telephone!

136
00:16:56,081 --> 00:17:02,850
''These moments,
l will remember for years''

137
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:10,053
''And when the seasons change,
l will complain''

138
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:17,859
''These moments,
l will cherish for years''

139
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:25,171
''lf the seasons change,
l will beg for them''

140
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:48,524
''Do not tease me, Lord Krishna''

141
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:54,595
''l'm only a milkmaid...
l'm not Radha''

142
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,837
''Do not tease me, Lord Krishna''

143
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:05,113
''l'm a milkmaid...
l'm not your beloved, Radha''

144
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:37,711
''Why have you held my hand?''

145
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:42,886
''l implore you, O Krishna''

146
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:48,159
''Why have you held my hand?''

147
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:53,153
''l implore you, O Krishna''

148
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,558
''You are naughty, O Krishna''

149
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:03,771
''l'm only a milkmaid...
l'm not your beloved Radha''

150
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:08,503
''Do not tease me, O Krishna''

151
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:36,865
''lt's Radha you always tease''

152
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:41,605
''She's the one you love''

153
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,882
''Why have you doused
those colours on me?''

154
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:52,221
''For l am only a milkmaid...
l'm not your Radha''

155
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,624
''Do not tease me, O Krishna''

156
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:02,962
''l'm only a milkmaid...
l'm not your Radha''

157
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:07,628
''Do not tease me, O Krishna''

158
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,780
Greetings.
- Bless you, son.

159
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,490
Please have this.

160
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,752
ls this the way to
accept a blessing?

161
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,963
Come on, bow to me first.

162
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,064
l know my name, Papa.

163
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:40,504
Come on, bow to me.
- How can he do that?

164
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:45,669
Why? Has he hurt his spine?
And l'm elder to him too.

165
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:49,179
And what are you gawking at?
Come on, bow to me.

166
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,442
Enough, my child.

167
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,852
Okay, cup your hand please.

168
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,180
The right one.

169
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,191
Better you open your mouth!

170
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:05,522
What are you looking at him for?
Forgot your mouth at home? Open it.

171
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,633
You couldn't have had your breakfast?
- No.

172
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,105
So have it with me.
- Daija won't forgive me, if l do.

173
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,040
She won't mind if it's with me.

174
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,579
He must have had all his
favorite dishes made.

175
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,612
''Spicy Bread''

176
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:31,055
My mouth's watering, dad...
l'm having my breakfast at his place.

177
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,921
You go ahead and get it all ready.
l'll join you there a little later.

178
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,130
l feel like having breakfast
on the terrace.

179
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,997
Terrace? But it's cloudy today.

180
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:54,342
That's wonderful! You keep it ready.
l'll just join you.

181
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,015
lf it starts raining,
how will you eat?

182
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,213
You'll just get wet
for nothing.

183
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:07,086
A superb breakfast. All these tasty
things and the rain falling...

184
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:11,362
Daija can really cook well.
- Here, have this...

185
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,763
l can eat by myself now.
l've grown up.

186
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,697
Everybody grows up.
But no one outgrows one's elders.

187
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,108
No dear, he has
really grown up now.

188
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,710
You have grown big, Sir.
lt's my hands that are small.

189
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,951
Your hand is bigger than the sky.

190
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,160
You haven't seen Rajasthan,
have you?

191
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,796
Daija, never showed it to me.
- How could l?

192
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,760
lt's his first visit here.

193
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,399
Then l'll make it
unforgettable for him.

194
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:57,207
l'll show him around and
get him stuck on to it,...

195
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,644
like glue on an envelope!

196
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:03,243
Anyway, it's a wet day today.
We'll make it tomorrow. Okay?

197
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,781
There's a man from
your house, Madam.

198
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,421
l'll take your leave then.
Be ready tomorrow, Viren.

199
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,087
Let the rain stop, my dear.
- lt's okay.

200
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,085
Be ready, Viren.

201
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:22,425
ls she the reason why you're so lost
in your thoughts these days?

202
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,835
Yes.

203
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:30,437
But she's older than you.

204
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:35,845
So what? l'm also younger to her.
lt's quits.

205
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:41,009
But such things are not
accepted in this country.

206
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,586
Does she love you just as much?

207
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,459
l don't know.

208
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,895
But you must know.

209
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:53,665
l'll ask her then.

210
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,203
What's this?
- Pallavi has sent it for you.

211
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:07,876
For me?

212
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,276
A letter too?

213
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,221
With due regards, to
His Lordship of London.

214
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:22,327
You must have seen such a dress
in the old portraits.

215
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,488
But this is the real attire
of our ancestors.

216
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:30,490
Play the Rajput just for today,
else you'll look like a tourist.

217
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:34,297
And Rajasthan will not be
one with you.

218
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:47,215
l'll look a fool in this!
- Your ancestors didn't!

219
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:49,247
But l'm not an ancestor.

220
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:54,321
But why tell me all this?
Return it. You can explain it to her.

221
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,158
No. l'll wear it.

222
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:15,906
l will come downstairs only if
you shut your eyes, Daija.

223
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:17,878
All right.

224
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:23,549
You must promise not to laugh at me.
- l promise. l will not laugh.

225
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,957
Even if l feel like it.

226
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:42,907
You promised you wouldn't laugh!

227
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,576
Didn't l say l'd look mad?
l'm not going!

228
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:49,703
No... you don't look mad at all.
You look handsome.

229
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,445
Hurry up and leave.
They must be awaiting you.

230
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:53,446
Go on.

231
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:56,246
Do l look good?
- Very good.

232
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:10,396
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings. May we leave?

233
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,404
Have you brought the car?
- No, sir.

234
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:16,334
ln that case, l'll take my car.
- No, sir.

235
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,775
No? How will go?

236
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,012
l've brought a camel, sir.
- A camel!

237
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:39,962
Go on.

238
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,635
Are you okay, sir?

239
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,658
Make it stand.

240
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:11,662
Steady...

241
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,484
Nothing's going to happen.

242
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:48,221
When l'm sad, l go to this place
l'm taking you to.

243
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:52,366
What do you do when you're sad?
- But l'm never sad.

244
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:57,707
You will be sad
when you're lonely.

245
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:59,153
The song means, ''When the peacock
calls during the night...''

246
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:01,791
''it pierces my heart
like a dagger''

247
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:15,339
''When the pea-hen
calls at midnight,...''

248
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,848
''My bangles...''

249
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:26,414
''My bangles tinkle, O Sir...
they tinkle in my hands''

250
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:32,688
''When the pea-hen calls in
the jungle at midnight''

251
00:30:53,985 --> 00:31:05,795
''l literally die of shame,
when people listen to my love story''

252
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:19,442
''l literally die of shame when
people listen to my love story''

253
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:27,914
''lt was a slip of the tongue,
when l was chatting...''

254
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:35,385
''and then my bangles tinkled, O Sir,
they tinkled in my hands''

255
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:44,924
''As the pea-hen in the jungle
called out in the night''

256
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:17,362
''Whenever l see the moon in the sky,
my eyes overflow with tears''

257
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:33,277
''l don't know when my beloved left.
But l wilted within, over the years''

258
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:47,726
''l don't know when my beloved left.
But l wilted within, over the years''

259
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:55,564
''My thirst was never quenched
even by the rains''

260
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:03,010
''And my bangles tinkled, O Sir,
they tinkled in my hands...''

261
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:07,009
''as the pea-hen called
in the night''

262
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:38,048
''Nights l have spent
lonely and sleepless''

263
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:43,443
''l have been robbed
of my sleep''

264
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:59,069
''Nights l have spent
lonely and sleepless''

265
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:04,472
''l have been robbed
of my sleep''

266
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:12,072
''My peace of mind
has left with my beloved''

267
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:19,816
''And my bangles tinkled, O Sir.
The bangles tinkled in my hands...''

268
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:24,093
''as the pea-hen
called in the night''

269
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:23,411
This is Salamat Ali, Sir.
- Yes, go on.

270
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,546
l'm sorry, but we have
lost the case, Sir.

271
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:32,959
What? We lost the case?
But how? You said...

272
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:36,561
l tried my best, Sir, but...

273
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:40,893
But your best wasn't enough.

274
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:48,176
You just lost a case,
but l've lost everything.

275
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:56,186
My wealth, this mansion,
everything....

276
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:10,200
What's happened?
- Nothing, my dear.

277
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:14,861
l'll call the doctor.
You wait here, Viren, l'll just come.

278
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:22,006
Please sit.
l want to talk to you.

279
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,944
Nobody knows, except me.

280
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:36,716
l had a case against my step-brother,
concerning our property.

281
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:42,230
Today the court has
ruled against me.

282
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:48,238
l'm not bothered about myself
- You'll be fine, Sir.

283
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:53,236
Pallavi will just die,
if she gets to hear of it.

284
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,977
Look after her.
Explain it to her.

285
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:05,246
l can't keep her to
anybody else's care.

286
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,386
Nothing will happen...

287
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,021
l've sent for the doctor.

288
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,854
Come dear;
l want to tell you something.

289
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:19,664
Whatever l'm telling you...
- Don't talk, Papa...

290
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:23,273
l've explained it to Viren here.

291
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:32,879
l've entrusted your responsibility
in his hands.

292
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,875
What do you mean?

293
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,849
Trust him, child.

294
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:41,291
Please rest now.
Don't talk.

295
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:25,734
l'm very worried about her.
She hasn't eaten for the past 2 days.

296
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:30,898
She's like a stone, she won't talk
neither will she listen.

297
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,344
Please do something.

298
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:13,546
Where had you been?
l was awaiting you for ages!

299
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:39,196
Cry, dear...
Go ahead and cry.

300
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,945
What's this?

301
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:59,213
l didn't know my eyes
held so many tears.

302
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,484
Your father mustn't be
liking you cry like this.

303
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:08,657
l'm not used to living without him.
What shall l do?

304
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:13,025
Face the facts, and learn
to live without him.

305
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,510
But how did this happen?

306
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:24,010
l don't know. lt was all so sudden.

307
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:31,048
But whatever he had to tell,
he told Viren.

308
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:34,524
Who's he?

309
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:38,027
The son of our neighbour.

310
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:40,931
The one who was here yesterday?

311
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:45,535
Will you listen to something
l have to say, Viren?

312
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:50,267
Why ask? Have l ever refused
to obey you?

313
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:55,277
ln that case, you must return
to London today itself.

314
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,217
You're being unfair, Daija.

315
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:03,883
You wouldn't let me return,
when l wanted to.

316
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:07,891
And now that l don't want to leave,
you're asking me to go away.

317
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,059
l have promised her father.

318
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:15,087
Mr. Siddharth is here
to see his Lordship.

319
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,969
Tell him that l'll be there.

320
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,258
Everything is well
over there, l hope?

321
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,864
Can't really say, your Lordship.

322
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:54,597
Call me Vir, Mr. Bhatnagar.

323
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:58,798
That also sounds very formal.
Call me Siddharth.

324
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:07,415
l don't know whether Pallavi
has mentioned me to you before.

325
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,612
No. Nothing.

326
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:14,919
We love each other...

327
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:25,033
But my family background
is not as colourful as yours.

328
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:27,637
Does that make any difference?

329
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:32,435
Not to me, and maybe even you.
But her father was very orthodox.

330
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:35,141
lt was very important to him.

331
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,377
Let alone a background,
l don't even have a family!

332
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,650
But then, your name...

333
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:50,659
l'm told l was found on a street
and brought up in an orphanage.

334
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,663
When it was time for me
to go to school...

335
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,321
a father's name was essential.

336
00:43:55,699 --> 00:44:00,659
The manager liked me a lot,
so he put his own name for me.

337
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:06,074
l was a good student, so l won
scholarships and continued to study.

338
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:12,682
This way, an orphan became an
officer in the Air-Force...

339
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:16,413
and at an Air-Force function,
l met Pallavi.

340
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:21,421
l was very scared
of my feelings for her.

341
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:26,486
But she's a special girl -
said it made no difference to her.

342
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:30,291
And that she'd managed her father.

343
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:36,700
He's no more, so l thought
why get married here?

344
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:42,208
May l take her with me?
We'll get married there.

345
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:51,312
lf you don't mind, we'd prefer
that she weds here.

346
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:55,054
And the bridal-couple leave
her ancestral home together.

347
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:02,732
Have you spoken to her
about the wedding?

348
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:07,199
l thought l'd talk to Viren
and then he'd convince her..

349
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:11,733
Don't worry about that
l'll talk to her myself.

350
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:25,482
This is Salamat Ali speaking.

351
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:26,754
Yes?

352
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:32,554
l've spoken to them, like you asked.
But they are very adamant.

353
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:36,090
Bring them to me.
l know how to deal with such lot.

354
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:43,767
Whose phone was it?

355
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:50,510
Give me a list of your invitees.
l'll invite them all.

356
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:54,580
There'll be just two from my side.
Daija and yourself.

357
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,447
l'll go now.

358
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:15,202
l didn't show him my feelings,
did l?

359
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,466
No, son.

360
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:24,604
This is the mother of the deceased
and they are his...

361
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:26,816
Step-brothers. My sons.

362
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:30,813
You know what l want.

363
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:34,486
How will we know what
exactly you want?

364
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:40,228
l don't want the result of this case
disclosed to the family here.

365
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:45,568
Pallavi will have to be told.
She has to vacate the house.

366
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:51,196
We're sorry that he died
just after hearing the news.

367
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:54,838
We didn't have the pleasure
of throwing him out physically..

368
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,840
But this bitch...

369
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:05,185
lf you say anything vile against them,
l'll pull your tongue out.

370
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:07,857
Now listen to me.

371
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:10,587
Till she leaves the house
with her husband,...

372
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:14,853
you are to stay away from here.

373
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:19,200
What will you give us for that?
- What's your price?

374
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:22,531
When will she leave?
- Next week.

375
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,270
That means 6 days from now.

376
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:28,400
That makes it 600,000.

377
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:31,881
And one more extra for the slap
you gave me.

378
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:42,892
Give them a cheque of one million.

379
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,702
Today all my efforts
have been worth it.

380
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:56,705
Today you've really matured.

381
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:00,033
Today l feel like addressing you
with your Title.

382
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:06,916
l have arrived.

383
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:20,289
How are you?
- Losing some hair...

384
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:26,432
How come you're here?

385
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,834
Then would there be a wedding
without me?

386
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:39,375
There's something l wanted
to discuss with you.

387
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,677
One moment...

388
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:45,288
Greetings!

389
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:49,720
My name is Prem.
l'm Viren's childhood friend.

390
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:53,028
When l was 7 year's old...

391
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:55,897
Greetings- Greetings.

392
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,909
The girl's superb. When are you getting
married my dear...

393
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:14,641
You've just come. Have a wash,
then we'll chat...

394
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:22,349
What a girl, What a choice...

395
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:28,998
l admit she's so lovely.
lt won't be easy to forget her.

396
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:32,661
But you should have told her
of your feelings, at least once.

397
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:36,528
What difference would that have made?
She'd have loved her guy anyway.

398
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:39,107
Well, it's not the end
of the world!

399
00:49:39,243 --> 00:49:41,006
Who knows?

400
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:43,171
But you....

401
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:45,677
There are no ''ifs''
and ''buts'' in love.

402
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:53,755
And before loving her, l hadn't put
a condition that she loves me too.

403
00:49:55,392 --> 00:50:02,355
She loved Siddharth, she'll be
happy with him. That's all l want.

404
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:08,367
May God save you
from the evil-eye.

405
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:14,200
You always were beautiful. But never
as beautiful as you look today.

406
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:18,444
l miss my father very much.

407
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:22,643
That you will, all your life.

408
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:27,756
He always said he'd go
as ''dowry'' with you.

409
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,791
Now his memories are your dowry.

410
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:33,429
No, don't cry.

411
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:38,066
May God give you
a long happy life.

412
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:44,271
What's wrong with Viren?
He hasn't met me for days.

413
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:53,413
He's very busy with the preparations.
He's your care-taker now.

414
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:59,087
Tell him that l won't leave
without meeting him.

415
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:02,090
lf l see him,
l'll give him your message.

416
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:10,095
''This kurta that's
made of muslin...''

417
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:13,135
''come dressed in it''

418
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:22,101
''l await you at the door.
Come dressed in a muslin kurta...''

419
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:28,117
l was told you were
asking for me...

420
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:45,862
l don't know whether my father
was happy with my choice.

421
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:53,869
But since l'm in your charge...
tell me, do you approve?

422
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,341
Why not?

423
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:01,448
Questions are not answered
by counter questioning.

424
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:05,221
Are you happy?

425
00:52:06,757 --> 00:52:07,985
Yes.

426
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,760
Then l am too.

427
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:18,765
l've been very bad to you.
l've really harassed you.

428
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:21,670
What nonsense!

429
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:25,174
You're very nice,
very decent.

430
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:31,776
lf l can ever be of help,
write to me.

431
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,181
Can l?

432
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:40,648
Go on.

433
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:47,757
Can l call you by
your first name?

434
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:55,933
Come, my dear. Everybody is waiting.
You too Viren.

435
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:45,120
''These moments, these memories,
l shall cherish for years to come''

436
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:56,394
''Should the seasons change,
l will beg for them''

437
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:08,143
''These moments, these memories,
l shall cherish for years to come''

438
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:19,646
''Should the seasons change,
l will appeal for them''

439
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:26,424
''l will cherish for years...''

440
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,543
May you live long.

441
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:59,894
Whenever you come, stay here a while.
Nobody should say the house is empty.

442
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:03,332
No, don't worry about that.

443
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,328
We'll look after the house
for you now.

444
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,737
What are these people doing here?

445
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:16,141
Tell her, Sir. She's asking
what are we doing here?

446
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:22,947
This is ours now. We were quiet,
because of Viren

447
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:26,150
Else we'd have thrown you out
six days ago.

448
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,582
Can't you people be polite?

449
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:32,156
Who is this guy? ls he trying
to teach us to be polite?

450
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:35,755
Don't ever think it's only the Rajputs
who are self-respecting

451
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:39,766
Every decent man can kill
and die for his self-respect

452
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:43,096
lf you say another word,
there'll be a death here.

453
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,976
Whose death?
- Either yours, or mine.

454
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:51,372
No. This is not the
time to keep quiet.

455
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:56,374
You people had said,
you'd come tomorrow.

456
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:02,189
You've got it wrong. We were paid
a million to keep away till today.

457
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:08,386
What's all this about?
What time limit? Which million?

458
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:13,732
Throw these people
out of our property.

459
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:18,066
This house, this land,
is all ours now.

460
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:20,738
Your father had lost the case...

461
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:30,843
Yes, Viren wanted you to leave happily
before they claimed it all.

462
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:34,081
That's why he had to buy
some time from them.

463
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:43,160
Papa died, the mansion is not mine.
l've become all alone now.

464
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:49,861
God forbid! Why should you feel alone?
You have your husband with you.

465
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:02,878
l cried so much against these walls.
Such insult to those tears.

466
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:06,255
l'll never forgive Viren for this.

467
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:11,950
That's your personal opinion,
but he did his duty.

468
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:17,462
We both are indebted to him.
And it's a debt we can never repay.

469
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:22,471
Just take me away from here.

470
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:30,476
Bless you, dear.
But don't misunderstand Viren.

471
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:37,145
There's no question about that.
Now l know why he didn't wait for you.

472
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:45,083
He didn't want to face this moment.
ln his place, l'd have done the same.

473
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:50,295
No work is done without contacts
these days, especially plane-bookings.

474
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:53,097
Your seats are confirmed.

475
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:56,096
Who are those other tickets for?
- For you.

476
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:58,507
And the former one?
- For me.

477
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:04,178
l know you much better than you think.
You can't cry alone.

478
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:10,014
When your dad died, l was present.
You used a shoulder to cry on.

479
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:14,682
What will l cry for this time?
- For your love.

480
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:18,516
Till you forget Pallavi,
l'm not leaving your side.

481
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,161
l don't think l'll ever forget her.

482
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:39,308
''These birds and the clouds
are crazy about lovers...''

483
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:42,073
''Who are we, O companion?''

484
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:45,553
''l can't remember,
l've forgotten''

485
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:49,558
''l can't remember,
l've forgotten''

486
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:55,558
''These birds and the clouds
are crazy about lovers''

487
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:58,559
''Who are we?''

488
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:01,971
''l can't remember...
l have forgotten''

489
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:06,567
''l can't remember,
l have forgotten''

490
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:34,058
''We need nothing''

491
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:42,202
''Nothing is more
beautiful than love''

492
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:51,010
''Where will these
waves take us?''

493
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:59,453
''l have no regret,
you are my shore''

494
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:07,330
''Life is but flowing water...
it can't be trusted''

495
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:12,463
''The birds and the clouds...
they're crazy about lovers''

496
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:15,636
''Who are we?''

497
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:19,081
''l can't remember,
l've forgotten''

498
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:23,085
''l can't remember...
l have forgotten''

499
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,672
''Lost, we are''

500
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:58,482
''Asleep, we remain''

501
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:06,685
''The world looks for us...
and we are lost''

502
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:15,694
''Asleep in a bed of desire''

503
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:23,110
''Come, let's get closer''

504
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:32,247
''Let's lose each other
in an embrace''

505
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:40,719
''We share dreams together...
there's nobody else''

506
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:45,732
''These clouds and the birds
are crazy about lovers''

507
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:48,400
''Who are we?''

508
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:52,304
''l can't say...
l have forgotten''

509
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:56,078
''l can't remember,
l have forgotten''

510
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:02,416
''Birds and the clouds
are crazy about lovers''

511
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:05,083
''Who are we?''

512
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:08,757
''l can't remember.
l have forgotten''

513
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:12,760
''l can't remember,
l have forgotten''

514
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:17,099
''l can't remember,
l have forgotten''

515
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:47,455
How lengthy a letter will you write?
Do you aim to tire him?

516
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:49,360
l've almost finished.

517
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:57,803
May l ask you something? How long
will you go on writing to him?

518
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:01,468
Why? Don't you like it?

519
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:04,976
But he hasn't replied you at all.

520
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:12,984
What difference does that make?
But he must know, he's very special.

521
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:22,531
Come here... closer.

522
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:29,238
May l say something?

523
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:35,239
Has Viren ever told how
much he loves you?

524
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:43,642
What! Did you say he...

525
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:47,185
l thought as much that you
would have no inkling.

526
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:51,121
What nonsense you talk.
You're mad..

527
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:58,858
l realized it the day
when you ran to me.

528
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:04,868
But he thought you sought his arms.

529
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:08,377
But when you fell in my arms,...

530
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:13,882
he realized he had
no place in your heart.

531
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:19,877
But why didn't l realize it all?

532
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,158
Because you had
your eyes on me then.

533
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:25,894
Then why didn't you tell me?

534
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:31,895
l don't have a copyright on love.
Any man would fall in love with you.

535
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:36,466
l won't write to him!
- Why not?

536
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:43,309
Give him some time to forget you.
lt's not easy to forget a first love.

537
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:47,379
Are you my husband
or Viren's lawyer?

538
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:54,389
No advocating, l'm only speaking the
truth. Promise me you'll write to him.

539
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:05,491
l'll pen you so many letters that
you'll get fed up and reply me.

540
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:11,940
l'll never forgive you for going
away without meeting me.

541
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:20,147
Listen, l didn't know that
motherhood meant so much to me.

542
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:24,110
Haven't you caught on?
l'm pregnant.

543
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:39,961
Speak loudly please.

544
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:44,499
Very bad news, son.
- You're well, aren't you?

545
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:50,377
Yes, but Siddharth was killed
in a car accident.

546
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:58,316
She wasn't with him, was she?
- Yes, she was.

547
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:02,317
Then nothing to fret about,
is there?

548
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:07,989
Yes there is, you better rush over.

549
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:24,341
l understand, but we'll have to operate.
She has lost a lot of blood.

550
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:29,677
And between the mother and child,
l can save only one.

551
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:32,747
Then save the mother.

552
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:42,296
Please do me a favour.
Save my baby.

553
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:45,200
Don't talk so much.

554
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:50,428
l beg you...

555
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:03,708
Trust in God.
lf He wills, both will be safe.

556
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:10,057
l could save the baby,
but she's very serious.

557
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,558
There's no time.
She wants to see you.

558
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:45,822
Viren was also a baby when you
took over him, isn't it?

559
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:48,323
Yes.

560
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:55,103
Viren is here too.

561
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,788
You better go and meet her.

562
01:08:22,164 --> 01:08:24,792
Please don't say anything.

563
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:35,667
You had asked me not to
hesitate if l wanted something.

564
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:41,473
Well, l want you to live
and be happy.

565
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:44,553
l want you...

566
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:26,528
''These moments, these memories,
l will cherish for years to come''

567
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:38,401
''Should the seasons change,
l will beg they be returned''

568
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:43,200
''l will cherish for years''

569
01:09:51,253 --> 01:10:03,927
''When the pea-hen
calls out in the night''

570
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:22,312
''The bangles tinkle in my hands.
See this, O Sir''

571
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:32,091
''The bangles tinkle in my hands''

572
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:44,464
''When the pea-hen
calls out in the nights''

573
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:19,307
Where did you find this beauty?

574
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:23,809
Beauty is found everywhere.
Beauty is beauty after all.

575
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:27,549
Then is it...
- Yes, Pallavi's daughter.

576
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:29,550
What's her name?

577
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:33,321
She has to be brought up
with reverence.

578
01:11:33,923 --> 01:11:36,255
So l've named her
''Puja'' (Puja=prayer).

579
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:06,148
Leaving today only, son?
- Yes.

580
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:09,357
Just one more day...

581
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:16,091
When l wanted to stay,
you insisted l go.

582
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:19,529
And now that l wish to go,
you stop me.

583
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:24,361
See Puja, just once at least.
She's one year old today.

584
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:28,968
l can never forget her birthday.

585
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:34,374
Can you blame her for that?
- No. But l wish her birthday,...

586
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:38,787
and Pallavi's death anniversary
didn't clash.

587
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:42,390
When will you come again?

588
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:45,392
Next year, on the
death anniversary.

589
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:50,390
You've grown up now.
Adults must learn to forget the past.

590
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:54,567
That's just it.
l just can't forget.

591
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:59,407
l'll go now.
- Bless you.

592
01:13:06,448 --> 01:13:11,147
''My little doll;
My little child...''

593
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:16,423
''From fairyland one day...''

594
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:25,423
''a prince will come to take
you away to the castles''

595
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:45,442
''My little doll...''

596
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:51,258
''you will one day
cast a magic spell''

597
01:13:57,433 --> 01:14:02,461
''You will grow up...''

598
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:07,808
''and l'll be an old woman''

599
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:13,474
''Don't you forget these ties
we share''

600
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:19,285
''My little doll;
my little child...''

601
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:23,883
''From fairyland one day...''

602
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:36,597
''a prince will arrive to take you
away into the castles''

603
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:42,066
''My little child;
my little doll...''

604
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:46,913
''From fairyland one day...''

605
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:58,419
''a prince will arrive to take
you away to the castles''

606
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:06,767
ls he here?
- Yes.

607
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:20,314
Don't shout.

608
01:15:20,716 --> 01:15:25,676
ls he upstairs? ln that case, l won't
let him go without seeing me this time.

609
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:29,484
He's tired, so let him sleep now.

610
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:32,894
Can l just peep?
- No! How many times must l tell you?

611
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:36,889
You never let me meet him.
Go! l won't talk to you!

612
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:45,573
What are you doing here?

613
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:48,569
Keeping a watch,
so he doesn't slip out.

614
01:15:49,812 --> 01:15:54,181
Mad! He's going tomorrow.
- Then l'll sit here, till tomorrow!

615
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:57,584
Okay. When you feel sleepy,
come upstairs to me.

616
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:49,902
Enough now!
Don't be silly.

617
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:55,039
l ran behind the car
but he didn't even look back.

618
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:58,646
You were behind the car,
so how could he see you?

619
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,241
l even called out to him.

620
01:17:01,683 --> 01:17:05,813
There must've been heavy breeze,
he must not have heard.

621
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:07,985
Meet him next year.

622
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:11,159
Just let me grow up!
- And what will you do?

623
01:17:11,426 --> 01:17:13,394
You won't tell him, will you?

624
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:17,063
l'll just marry him.
Then where will he go?

625
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:20,065
Every time he comes, he has
just given me a gift.

626
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:22,829
Where's my gift, by the way?

627
01:17:23,705 --> 01:17:26,265
Here it is.

628
01:18:16,825 --> 01:18:19,726
Prem, l found those people
a bit too smart.

629
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:23,724
Not smart, but like
their name, ''crooks''

630
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:27,726
Shows off his helicopter
to us, my foot.

631
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:29,897
We know our importance too.

632
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:33,733
So the deal will be as per our terms.
One thing, don't compromise.

633
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:37,537
There was a call for you from Anita.

634
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,480
Who can forget that girl?

635
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:54,194
Hadn't l called you actually?
- How could l leave him behind?

636
01:18:56,798 --> 01:19:03,431
Actually we are tolerating each other.
ln fact, all are enduring each other.

637
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:09,770
God shouldn't bless anyone with beauty.

638
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:11,946
See, she's calling out to me.

639
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:26,794
Keep laughing like this forever.

640
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:30,460
You've a special place
in my life.

641
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:34,802
You have held me together,
else l'd have just died.

642
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:38,239
Why don't you come out
of those shadows?

643
01:19:40,842 --> 01:19:46,542
l know. And whenever l shut my eyes,
she stands before me, alive.

644
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:54,618
Memories aren't something
man can simply expend with.

645
01:19:55,390 --> 01:20:01,625
l must have failed somewhere along,
for you to not forget her as yet.

646
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:06,323
lt's my fault.
Maybe l'm not trying hard enough.

647
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:18,838
l'm speaking from here only.
Our flight is due soon.

648
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:36,864
l'm thinking of getting married.
What do you think?

649
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:40,868
Don't talk to me like that.
l'm not one of those.

650
01:20:41,103 --> 01:20:42,627
Please be serious.

651
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:45,668
Of course. Do you think
it'll be proper?

652
01:21:07,262 --> 01:21:14,691
How long can a man chase shadows?
What do you think of Anita?

653
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:19,307
Do you love her?

654
01:21:21,343 --> 01:21:24,471
l have already loved once.
Now l want to marry.

655
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:28,515
l will marry Anita,
after l come back.

656
01:21:29,951 --> 01:21:34,684
l'll call Daija too.
And that's that.
