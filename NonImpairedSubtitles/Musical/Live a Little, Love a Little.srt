Go away.
Why don't you go play in the water?

Go chase the wind. Come on. Go away.

Okay, you just stay right where you are.

Come on. Get off the blanket, will you?
I want to lie down.

Hey, lady, is this your horse?

12
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,920
He's a dog, and his name is Albert.

13
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,560
He's interested in new things.

- Well, I'm not a new thing.
- But to Albert you are.

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,760
Do you mind if I sit here a moment
on the sand?

16
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,560
It's not my sand. Sit anywhere you like.

Thank you.

18
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,960
The sand is grainy.

It usually is.

- Your name.
- Greg Nolan.

- Married?
- Nope.

- Not if I can help it.

- For the Olympics?
- What else?

00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,640
You come on pretty strong, don't you?

36
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,000
No. Not really.
It's just a theoretical question.

37
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,560
- But answer me.
- Restate the question.

38
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,000
Would you like to make love to me?

- In front of Albert?
- Don't you think I'm attractive?

- You're too much.
- How do you mean that?

You know, it's very difficult

Come close to me.

I said, I thought you told me
your name was Alice.

Oh, yes. Well, you can call me Mrs. Baby.

Here I had just met
the only man I'd ever love,

156
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,240
and he was about to make
a left turn right out of my life.

157
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,600
- So what did I do? What could I do?
- I don't know.

158
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,520
I cut my wheels hard to the left

159
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,280
and stepped on the... What do you call it?
You know, the gas dealie,

160
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,600
and smashed in his right door.
Quick thinking.

00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,960
And then he fell in love with me,
and we got married,

162
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,560
and he developed whooping cough
and died.

163
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,640
Whooping cough? I thought you said
he died of an affliction of the liver.

164
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,880
Well, what's the difference?

165
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,760
- Just as I thought.
- What, what, what?

166
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,280
98.6!
You better take some more medicine.

167
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,800
- But that's normal.
- You wanna die like Harry?

168
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,840
- You don't even know what he died of.
- Well, neither did he.

169
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,040
Give me your hand. Now swallow.

170
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,000
Nope. Not until you get me some water.

171
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,200
Okay.

172
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,280
Come on, Albert, don't be a fink.

I just love watching men in the morning.

176
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,680
Do you generally use a straight razor,
or is this how Harry died?

I have different names for different moods.

181
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,920
What mood are you in today?

182
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,960
I haven't decided yet.

183
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,440
Is it all right if I sit down?

184
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,680
- Ask Albert.
- Is it okay, Albert?

He says it's all right.

187

Do you mind if I give you a little kiss?

188
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,160
Well, what if one of your little friends
came in here and saw us?

189
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,760
I locked the front door.

190
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,760
All I want is a little huggybear.

191
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,120
- Huggybear?
- Yeah, you relax and I'll hug.

- I think I hear bells.
- Groovy. That's a good sign.

194
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,200
- Good morning, Bernice.
- Good morning.

195
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,480
Bernice? What the hell is your name?

196
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,920
My name is Bernice. Harry, this is Greg.

197
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,880
- Hi, Greg.
- Harry Baby?

198
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,680
- That's me.
- I thought you told me he was dead?

199
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Did she also tell you
that I was her husband?

200
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,720
Yeah.

201
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,080
- I'm not really.
- Well, I'm glad to hear that.

202
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,560
Well, I guess I'm disturbing you.

203
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,120
- Oh, Harry, please don't feel that way.
- Why not?

204
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,280
Oh, I just came back to get my shoe trees.

205
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,440
This must be your pipe.

206
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,360
Hey, I was wondering
what happened to that.

207
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,120
That's my robe, too. Thanks a million.

208
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,720
Well, I guess I'll be cutting out.

209
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,400
- I'll see you to the door...
- What about your shoe trees?

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,720
What about my shoe trees?

00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,440
- Bye-bye, Greg.
- Bye-bye, Harry.

212
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,640
Well, thank you, Bernice, for letting me
come back and get my things.

213
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,800
Oh, that's perfectly all right, Harry.

214
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,040
- I'll try not to bother you again.
- It's always a pleasure to see you.

215
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,720
- Later.
- Bye.

216
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,880
Greg, what are you doing?

217
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,360
- 10:00 a.m. Checking out time.
- Don't be ridiculous.

218
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,400
- How did Harry get in here?
- With his key, of course.

Oh, how else.

220
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,760
Greg, you really ought to lie down.
You're a very sick person.

221
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,360
I'm a very sick person?

222
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,080
Look, maybe we'll see each other again
sometime, huh?

223
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,080
Maybe.

Albert, did anybody ever tell you,
you snored?

Down checking on something
with the presses.

Well, this is it.

247
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,960
It keeps jumping back into the wall
when you're ironing on it.

248
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,720
And it flops back down
when you want to put it away.

an ironing board.

If you'd listen to somebody
when they tell you something,

278
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,800
you would know what her name is.

279
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,880
I've told you four times.

280

Why don't you tell him
your name is Bernice?

281

Oh, Greg, your poor face. What happened?

I got fired from my job, I got into a fight,

and now I find out I don't live
in my own home anymore.

Oh, let me...

285
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,600
Damn it, Bernice,
what do you want from me?

286
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,160
- Now, where are my things?
- They're in Albert's room.

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,160
Except some of your shirts.
I sent them to the laundry.

You sent them to the laundry?

and pay my back rent?

I'll just wait right here until you come out
and give me an answer.

00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,880
You might as well come out.

- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

299

I don't want to inflict myself upon you.

300
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,080
You may have the house for tonight,

301
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,120
but please don't forget
to give Albert his dinner.

302
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,920
Well, where are you gonna go?

303
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,880
I don't know. Where were you gonna go?

304
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,000
I hadn't really thought about it.

305
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,560
Look. You don't have to leave.
I can spend the night in Albert's room,

306
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,560
and tomorrow I'll go look for a job
and a place to stay.

You can stay as long as you want to, Greg.

308

Just for tonight.

309
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,720
Now, why don't you take off this coat
and relax?

310
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,480
That's a dirty trick.

311
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,160
I'm still leaving in the morning.

Oh, well, I don't know.
Is it okay with you, Greg?

00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,600
Oh, any friend of Bernice's

That looks great. What is it?

- Your favorite.
- Egg rolls and hot dog?

- No. Beef and beer stew.
- That's good, too.

Hey, look at his face.
You get caught in a revolving door, Greg?

- No. It's a gift from my boss.
- Hey, man.

- What kind of work do you do?
- I was a news photographer.

- I got fired today.

Coffee, tea, milk and woof.

- Coffee with.
- With what?

379
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,120
With a side order of woof.

going here, haven't you, Harry?

00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,640
Yeah, I noticed.

388
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,440
She doesn't love me.
She's just being kind to me.

389
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,000
- Oh, that's big of her.
- You don't know her, Greg. She's scared.

390
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,760
- Scared to death.
- Scared of what?

No, it's true.

394
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,320
Making love never quite works for her.

395
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,640
She always stops short.

396
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,520

to find the man who can

bring her the right kind of love.

destroy every guy she meets.

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,840
Well. Truth is beauty.

467
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,480
And the highest expression of beauty

468
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,960
is the relationship between
a man and a woman.

469
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,720
It is to the glorification of this relationship

470
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,880
that Landsdown Enterprises is dedicated.

471
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,400
I'm with you.

472
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,760
You any good?

473
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,920
- As a lover?
- As a photographer!

474
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,080
- That I am.
- Let me see.

475
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,720
Fuzzy.

476
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,960
Soft focus.

477
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,400
I think it's the steam.
The pictures are melting.

478
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,920
Yeah, but they're all dressed.

479
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,200
People don't wanna see women
with clothes on.

480
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,240
I wish I moved in your circles.

481
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,760
I don't think we see eye to eye, Nolan.

482
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,680
No, I don't think so, either.

483
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,000
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Where are you going?

484
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,760
We haven't finished yet.
Come on over here.

485
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,960
Here, try a wheat germ and clam juice
cocktail. It's good for the liver.

486
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,880
I think I know what you're looking for.

487
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,960
How about these shots?

488
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,080
Yeah. That's better.

489
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,120
Much better.

490
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,400
Yeah, that's much, much better.

491
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,800
- Still want to work here?
- I thought you said there was no job.

492
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,520
Changed my mind.
How much are you asking?

493
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,360
- A thousand a month.
- All right, we'll try it for a couple of weeks,

494
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,920
and see what we'll see.

495
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,080
You start tomorrow. 9:00 sharp.
If you're late, you're fired.

496
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,680
And get rid of that suit.

497
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,800
I can't stand to see men wearing ties.
It's bad for the circulation.

498
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,080
And always remember, bottoms up.

499
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,760
Sorry I'm late. I got off on the wrong floor.

500
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,840
Welcome to Radlin, Kernig,
Canford and Penlow.

501
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,440
Whom do you wish to see?

502
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,840
- Radlin.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Radlin is not in at present.

503
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,920
Is there someone else who can help you?

504
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,280
- Kernig.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Kernig is not in at present.

505
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,440
Is there someone else who can help you?

506
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,960
Canford.

507
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,960
I'm sorry, Mr. Canford died two years ago.
Is there someone else who can help you?

508
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,640
Who else is there?

509
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,400
- Would you like to speak with Mr. Penlow?
- Is he in?

510
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,680
- Yes.
- Good, I'll speak with Mr. Penlow.

511
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,720
I'm sorry, Mr. Penlow is in conference.

512
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,680
- Tell Penlow I wish to speak to him.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Penlow is in conference.

513
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,160
Tell him!

514
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,000
- Very well, do you have an appointment?
- Tell him!

515
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,520
- Whom shall I say is calling?
- Tell him Nolan is here with the truth.

516
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,200
Very well.

517
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,640
Mr. Penlow, a Mr. Nolan says
he is here with the truth.

518
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,360
Nolan. Truth.

519
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,160
Yes, Mr. Penlow.

520
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,880
It's the second door on the right.

521
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,240
Personal appearance is a virtue
not to be treated lightly.

522
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,440
I take great stock in the cut
of a man's clothes.

523
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,080
As Benjamin Franklin so aptly put it,
"Eat to please thyself, but dress

524
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,280
"to please others."

525
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,120
Oh, I'm sure if your secretary
came in right now,

526
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,480
my appearance
wouldn't exactly please her.

527
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,240
Hey, I wonder if I could have
my trousers, please?

528
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,520
When they are ready.

529
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,440
"Constant complaint is the poorest
sort of pay for all the comforts we enjoy."

530
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,800
- Also Benjamin Franklin.
- Oh, good old Ben.

531
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,640
Receptionist said that you're here
with the truth.

532
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,760
That's right.

533
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,600
Good, good. There's precious little left of it
in this business. God knows.

534
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,240
How right you are.

535
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,600
The truth is, I need a job.

536
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,360
Thank you. I said, the truth is, I need a job.

537
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,800
I heard you, I heard you.
I'm not deaf, you know.

538
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,600
I'm sorry.

539
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
The truth is, he needs a job.

540
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,320
My boy, you're a natural-born
attention-getter.

541
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,440
And what is advertising?
The art of attracting attention.

542
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,880
Exactly my feelings.

543
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,600
- What are you, a copywriter?
- No, I'm a photographer.

544
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,880
A photographer. Well, well.

545
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,240
- It's an honest profession.
- Lf you're good.

546
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,480
Let's see if you're good.

547
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,480
The secret of good photography
is not to be fooled by what you see.

548
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,520
And get to know your subjects, find
the truth in them and photograph that.

549
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,080
Very impressive. I like your style.

550
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,000
- How much money do you need?
- A thousand a month to start.

551
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,480
- With a substantial raise in six months.
- Fair enough, fair enough.

552
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,640
Also all fringe benefits,
including use of the company parking lot.

553
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,480
Assuming you're still here in six months.

554
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,760
You can start tomorrow at 9:00 or 9:30.

555
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,720
I expect my people
to be impeccably dressed at all times.

556
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,040
Keep that in mind.

557
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,640
While you're here,
take a look at the darkroom.

558
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,480
See if there's anything you need.
My receptionist will show you where it is.

559
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,240
The door to the service stairway
is over there.

560
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,840
- What door?
- Behind the boxes.

561
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,840
I'll have this darkroom cleared out for you.

562
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,320
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

563
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,360
Yeah.

564
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,600
(PHONE RINGING)

565
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,600
You have reached a disconnected number.

566
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,320
Please hang up and dial again.
This is a recording.

567
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,760
This is a recording, too.

568
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,400
I was calling to invite you out
to dinner, but never mind.

569
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,240
Greg, wait a minute. Is that you?

570
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,520
Yes. I got a job.
As a matter of fact, I got two.

571
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,880
One for you and one for me.

572
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,360
- I don't understand.
- It's simple.

573
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,200
The second job is to pay you back
the money you put up for my back rent.

574
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,400
Oh, you're too much.

575
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,360
Look, I'll be over about 5:00, pick up
my things, and we'll go out and celebrate.

576
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,120
Okay, I'll be ready.

577
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,680
(DOORBELL RINGING)

578
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,520
I wish she'd stop putting garlic
in your food.

579
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,560
"Dear Greg. Had to run an errand.

580

"Meet me at 211 Lookout Mountain Drive."

581
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,880
Okay, Albert, get out.
I didn't invite you to dinner.

582
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,960
(GROWLING)

583
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,480
What are you doing for dinner, Albert?

584
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,440
Hi, Albert. Hello, darling. Welcome home.

585
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,800
What have you got going, now?

586
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,880
Why, nothing. I merely found you
a place to stay. You said you wanted one.

587
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,600
And it's a lovely one-bedroom house.

588
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,320
You're kidding.

589
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,480
How did you find it?

590
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,880
The landlady is a friend of Harry's.
She lives down the street.

591
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,360
She conducts séances or something.

592
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,720
I suppose she sends one of her ghosts
around to collect the rent.

593
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,880
I told her you'd pay
the first and last month, next week.

594
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,520
- Oh, gee, thanks, kid.
- Happy housewarming, Greg.

595
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,600
(EX CLAIMS)

596
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,280
- I should have known you'd be here.
- Oh, now, don't be nasty.

597
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,120
Harry brought the champagne
and the dinner.

598
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,560
Yeah, egg rolls and hot dogs.
You'll love 'em.

599
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,720
Here it goes. Stand back.

600
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,520
They told me it was a good year.

601
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,760
I thought I was taking you
to dinner tonight.

602
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,920
Oh, but isn't this nicer?

603
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,280
Your first night in your new home
with good company and good food.

604
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,680
Yeah, sit down, Greg. Champagne?

605
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,000
I'm not thirsty.

606
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,160
More for us, huh, Bernice?

607
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:03,280
Not bad. To us.
A long and lasting friendship.

608
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,040
Well, I guess I'll be going.

609
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,280
- Are you sure you won't stay?
- He's sure.

610
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,200
Thank Harry for the champagne
and the dinner.

611
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,680
May I say, I never liked egg rolls
and hot dogs before,

612
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,760
but now I hate them.

613
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,480
I'm glad, Greg.

614
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,480
- Good night, Bernice.
- Good night.

615
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,240
Rots of ruck in your new pad, Greg.

616
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,200
- I'd like to rots of ruck you...
- Good night, Harry. Good night, Harry.

617
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,080
I don't believe it. We're finally alone.

618
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,320
I guess I should thank you

I was afraid you didn't like it.

620
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,680
Oh, I like it. I'm just not used
to having a house picked out for me.

621
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,160
Oh, I'm sorry.

622
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,280
I was only trying to help,
but I guess I did something wrong again.

623
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,720
- I forgot Bernice.
- That's all right. I'll drive her home.

624
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,600
Oh, no, no. Always leave the party
with the girl I brung.

- Old rule of mine.
- I said I'd take her home.

this ridiculous situation can continue?

631

Well, I don't think it's ridiculous.
I think it's civilized.

632
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,760
Civilized? It'd be civilized
if we called the whole thing off.

633

You so much as try
and call the whole thing off,

634
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,400
and I shall feed you, personally,
to my large dog for breakfast.

And that's a solemn promise.

You got a thing about elevators?

Yeah, they're too slow. Too slow.

- Oh, good morning, Greg. Good morning.

- It looks good. Looks good.

Bernice and I were just talking about you.

I thought we had a date tonight.

Well, that's what
we were just talking about.

- I'll tell you what I say.

Excellent. Just excellent.

They're excellent. Just what we needed.

- No, just a little personal problem.

Well, let's have none of that.
You want to make it in advertising, right?

your hair, who shrinks your head.

How about giving me
a six months' advance on my salary?

A six months' advance on your salary?

No, Mike, you're not unreasonable.

in advance, I say, "All right."

his six months' salary in advance."

00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,080
I've heard so much about 'em,
but I've never tasted one. May I?

772
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,880
Be my guest.

773
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,120
- They put too much vodka in for my taste.
- They did?

774
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,880
Oh, I mean, yes. They did.

775
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,880
We have a lot in common.

776
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,160
Yes.

777
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,120
What month were you born?

778
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,240
- December.
- Sagittarius.

779
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,560
We're not suited. It would never work out.

780
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,280
Let's see if we can't
double-cross the stars.

781
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,000
What's your name?

782
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,200
Ellen.

783
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,440
- What was that for?
- Oh, just testing.

784
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,400
One test doesn't prove anything.

785
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,120
You don't taste bad for a Sagittarius.

786
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,960
Let's cut out of here, Ellen.

787
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,360
You can't fool around with the planets.

788
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,400
I know something much more reliable
than the planets.

789
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,320
There just isn't anything.

790
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,160
You wait right here, I'll be back.

791
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,600
- Can I get a picture? Just one.
- Not right now, thank you.

792
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,320
Great shot with that thing, hold it!

793
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,920
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

794
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,680
This computer will prove to you
that the planets are wrong.

795
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,800
Well, it's just making a lot of sound.

796
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,720
Yeah, but you have to understand
what it's saying.

797
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,200
- Do you know what it's saying?
- Of course I know what it's saying.

798
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:59,640
<i>(SINGING A LITTLE LESS CONVERSA TION)</i></i>

799
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,000
- Is this where you live?
- Yep.

800
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,400
It's lovely.

801
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,840
Such a romantic view.

802
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,400
You don't waste much time, do you?

803
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,520
- Good evening, Mr. Nolan.
- Good evening.

804
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,920
My goodness, you're home late tonight.

805
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,440
- Who is that woman?
- That woman? She's my...

806
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,400
- Housekeeper.
- Housekeeper.

807
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,240
She vacuums at this time of the morning?

808
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,680
Oh, it's the only free time I have.

809
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:11,440
- How many keys did you have made?
- Enough.

810
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,280
Mr. Nolan, I must remind you,
I only work in respectable houses,

811
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,040
and it looks to me like
there's a little hanky-panky going on here.

812
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,920
Well, if you feel that way about it,
why don't you leave? Now.

813
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,560
Oh, no, never put off until tomorrow
what you can do today. Right?

814
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,040
Excuse me.

815
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:30,040
Greg, I've gotta go home, really.
It's late, and I've got to work tomorrow.

816
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,880
Oh, why don't we talk this over, in there?

817
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,560
Albert's in there.

818
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,480
- Who's Albert?
- My dog.

819
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,640
(ALBERT GROWLING)

820
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,120
Would you drive me home?

821
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,880
Why not? Let's go to your place.

822
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,840
And you, you'd better be gone
by the time I get back.

823
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,640
(CRASHING)

824
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,840
Well, you'll have to see what happened.

825
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,240
I got a feeling I'm going to be sorry!

826
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,640
Oh, my goodness!

827
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,960
- I'll call a doctor.
- And get me a cab.

828
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,200
(GROANING)

829
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,320
Well, Doctor?

830
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,200
I can't find anything but the bump
on her head where she hit the table.

(MUMBLING)

832
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,240
What'd she say?

833
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,560
Try to keep her quiet for a few days.

834
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,560
When she's able to get up, you might
bring her by the office for an x-ray.

835
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,520
Thanks a lot, Doctor.
Sorry to call you so late.

836
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,600
Don't you worry about it.
I'll bill you for it. Good night.

837
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,040
Good night.

838

(WHINING)

840
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:44,200
If you think I'm going to take you out
for a walk now, you're nuts.

841
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,160
Okay. Let's just walk away from it.

842
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,240
(STUTTERING) But wait, now wait.
You just don't understand.

843
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,160
- Now, you let me...
- Don't worry about it. It looks good.

844
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,040
Unless the material is draped

845
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,920
in symmetrical harmony
with the hypotenuse of the models...

846
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,000
GREG: Right. Right.

847
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,960
- Let's get this one shot and go home.
- Now, now just a minute!

848
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,440
- You just wait just a minute, here.
- Hit the lights.

849
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,680
- Pretty. Pretty.
- But you don't understand.

850
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:14,080
I am trying to develop
an intrinsic multilateral symmetry

851
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,680
between animate and inanimate objects.

852
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,000
No, no.

853
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:21,200
Think of all the time that I've spent
shopping, shopping, shopping...

854
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,000
- Okay, girls. Here we go.
...for all the material.

855
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,440
- Hold still.
- All those panels must fit the...

856
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,320
Greg, will you get some
individual shots of the girls, please?

857
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,600
- Yes, sir.
- That's a very good idea, Mr. Penlow.

858
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,080
Thank you.

859
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,640
Good night, Mr. Penlow.
Have a pleasant evening.

860
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,120
Goodbye, baby.

861
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,720
Hi, there.

862
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,320
Glad to see you're leaving
at a decent hour, my boy.

863
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,120
- Hi, Greg.
- You know, Pat here looked great

864
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,240
in those outfits, Mr. Penlow.

865
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,160
I know. I know.

866
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,440
Hello, Landsdown.

867
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,400
Hi, Mike.

868
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,320
You two know each other?

869
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,480
As a matter of fact, Lewis, we do.

870
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,160
Good night, Greg.

871
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,320
Wait a minute.
What do you think you're doing?

872
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:44,480
I haven't finished reading this part, yet.
Thank you.

873
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,760
- Don't hit me.
- I'm not going to hit you.

874
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,000
- I had a reason to be here.
- I bet it's a good one.

875
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,080
Well, she borrowed my car.
I had to come and get it.

876
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:16,080
That's a good one. Say, Harry,
I hear you're selling your house.

877
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,440
Well, I tried to, but I just couldn't.

878
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,800
That house holds a lot of memories.

879
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,120
After she left me, I was Ionely.

880
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,560
She left you?

881
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,120
Well, she moved out.
Said she didn't want to see me again.

882
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,800
Stick with it, Harry. You can do it.

883
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:32,000
I know I can do it if I try.

884
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,760
Well, so long, Greg.

885
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,120
- Yeah. See you, Harry.
- Probably.

886
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,680
Off. Off. Come on.

887
01:05:58,880 --> 01:05:59,840
(GROANING)

888
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,600
- I brought you some chicken.
- Thank you.

889
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,240
Thank you.

890
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,400
- How do you feel today?
- Better.

891
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,400
I was able to brush
my own teeth this evening.

892
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:12,880
Good for you.

893
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,880
- I ran into Harry outside.
- He came back for his car.

894
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,200
That's what he told me.

895
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:27,640
I hope you realize how much
I appreciate what you're doing for me.

896
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,840
It's perfectly all right. Perfectly all right.

897
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,200
I hope it's not too much
of an inconvenience.

898
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,480
Inconvenience?

899
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,760
To have a full-grown horse
and a half-grown woman

900
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,720
share my one-bedroom house?

901
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,640
You must be kidding.

902
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,600
- What're you going to do?
- I'm going to take a hot shower.

903
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,560
My back's been killing me all day.

904
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,520
Did you have any dinner?
Aren't you hungry?

905
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:53,600
I had something to eat on the way home.
I just want to get some sleep.

906
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,040
Bernice, was there something
you wanted in here?

907
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,440
- I just came in to get an aspirin.
- Go ahead.

908
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,720
Thank you.

909
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,760
- Got it?
- Yeah.

910
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,240
Good.

911
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,960
Is there something else you want?

912
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,160
Do you want me to scrub
your back for you?

913
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,400
No, that's not necessary. Thank you.

914
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,280
- No, I don't mind. Really I don't.
- It's not necessary.

915
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,760
- Look, Bernice, why don't you go...
- Afraid?

916
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,880
- Of what?
- That you might lose control.

917
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,760
I never lose control.

918
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:50,000
Okay. Prove that you can allow me
to scrub your back without attacking me.

919
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,400
- You're nuts. Nuts!
- Are you afraid?

920
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,200
- Of course not.
- Fine.

921
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:00,640
(EX CLAIMS)

922
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,080
My back don't go that far down.

923
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,760
- Beginning to lose control, huh?
- Hell, no.

924
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:06,280
Watch it!

925

- On the sand?
- Sure. It's not my sand.

1078
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,000
Why did you run away?

1079
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:35,120
Harry said you came back to him.

1080
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,480
Harry's full of lemon drops.

1081
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:40,360
I haven't seen him
since he came to pick up his car.

1082
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:43,800
Well, if you didn't go back to Harry,
then why did you leave?

1083
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,760
- To think.
- About what?

1084
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:49,440
Love.

1085
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,520
What did you decide?

1086
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:56,120
I decided I love you.

1087
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:58,560
You know something?

1088
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:00,640
I love you, too.

1089
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,600
What did you feel?

1090
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,840
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

1091
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:09,680
N-O-T-H...

1092
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,480
- Sic her, Albert!
- Now, wait a minute. That's not fair.

1093
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,360
Go get her. Go get her, Albert. Go!

1094
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,080
Albert! You traitor!

1095
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:21,400
You can't do this to me! I feed you!

1096
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:24,600
Albert! Help! I can't swim!

1097
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,160
- I'll never forgive you!
- Come on in, Bernice.

1098
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:30,800
- It's time to go home.
- I'll meet you halfway.
