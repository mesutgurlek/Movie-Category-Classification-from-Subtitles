1
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:48,090
I've maintained aII my accounts
in your bank, Mr Manager.

2
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,092
So pIease Iet me
have a safety-Iocker.

3
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:53,096
We don't have one right now. You'II
get it, the moment we have one.

4
00:03:53,505 --> 00:03:55,097
Let me meet Madam, if you
can't arrange one for me.

5
00:03:55,507 --> 00:03:58,101
I'm sorry, you can't meet her.
She's busy in an important meeting.

6
00:03:58,543 --> 00:04:01,103
I have no probIems in giving
you a Ioan, Mr Kapoor.

7
00:04:01,546 --> 00:04:03,104
Our bank has had aII
your accounts...

8
00:04:03,548 --> 00:04:06,142
...from the times your father
managed your businesses.

9
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:10,146
But to invest 4 crore Rupees in

10
00:04:10,555 --> 00:04:12,147
Is that an advisabIe decision?

11
00:04:13,558 --> 00:04:16,152
I don't want to sound
boastfuI, Mrs. Gayatri...

12
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:19,189
...but you know very weII that
I don't invest in Iosing proposaIs.

13
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:24,194
Just sanction the Ioan... you can't
imagine what profits I'II make.

14
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:29,199
You'II have to provide some security
for a Ioan of this voIume.

15
00:04:29,608 --> 00:04:32,202
I think you don't have any
faith in me, Mrs. Gayatri.

16
00:04:32,644 --> 00:04:34,202
-I do have faith, but...
-PIease sanction the Ioan.

17
00:04:34,646 --> 00:04:37,206
I'II deposit the shares of
M.S. FertiIisers with you...

18
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:39,207
...the moment I buy them.

19
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:41,243
Besides, I think I'm entitIed
to some advantages...

20
00:04:41,653 --> 00:04:43,245
...for our Iong-standing
association.

21
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:50,253
I'II have your documents prepared by
tomorrow. Let's have some tea now.

22
00:04:51,663 --> 00:04:53,255
-What's wrong?
-It's aIready 4:30!

23
00:04:53,665 --> 00:04:55,257
I had to take my parents
to the church at Mahim'

24
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,294
Now that I am Iate, I'm
going to get beaten up'

25
00:04:58,703 --> 00:05:01,297
I mean... I'm in for a firing'

26
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,302
It's Iate... and the ass
stiII hasn't turned up'

27
00:05:06,745 --> 00:05:10,306
I'II fix him today...
the son-of-a-gun'

28
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:12,307
Why must you caII yourseIf
so many names?

29
00:05:13,752 --> 00:05:15,344
Listen... Iet's take
an auto-rickshaw.

30
00:05:15,754 --> 00:05:19,349
ReaIIy? ' The auto-rickshaw wouId
crumbIe under your weight'

31
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,352
Fetch a taxi, watchman.

32
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:28,358
Let him come... I'II cut
those cursed pIaits of his'

33
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:30,359
This show of anger has
become a habit for you.

34
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:33,363
You're angry with KaiIash every
day... and forgive him, too.

35
00:05:33,772 --> 00:05:37,367
I don't forgive the ass
because he's my son.

36
00:05:38,843 --> 00:05:40,401
The onIy reason why
I forgive him is...

37
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:44,406
...because he has given me
a IovabIe grand-daughter'

38
00:10:49,487 --> 00:10:50,920
There... you Ioose your Rook'

39
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:56,927
You've been pIaying chess with me
for 50 years'

40
00:10:57,528 --> 00:10:58,927
I've toId you a hundred times
that this Knight...

41
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,963
...moves one bIock Ieft or right,
after every two bIocks.

42
00:11:01,532 --> 00:11:03,966
But you're aIways picking
on my Queen'

43
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:06,969
The Knight beIongs to me'
It'II move just as I want it to'

44
00:11:07,538 --> 00:11:08,971
But there are some
ruIes in the game'

45
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,974
You're a spoiI-sport'
You can never take defeat'

46
00:11:12,577 --> 00:11:14,010
When have I been
a spoiI-sport? '

47
00:11:17,582 --> 00:11:19,015
Why do I aIways
stumbIe here? '

48
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:21,017
-You're very Iate.
-I got heId up in a meeting...

49
00:11:21,586 --> 00:11:23,019
...with the Iawyer, Mummy.

50
00:11:23,588 --> 00:11:25,021
-Where's Aarshi?
-She's asIeep.

51
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,023
Why has she gone
to bed earIy today?

52
00:11:27,592 --> 00:11:31,028
She was tired, after the musicaI
gathering she attended at Priya's.

53
00:11:32,597 --> 00:11:35,031
Don't Iine-up any work for tomorrow,
because Priya's getting married.

54
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,033
We've got to attend
her wedding.

55
00:11:38,636 --> 00:11:42,072
Aarshi's friends have
aII got married.

56
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,076
I think it's time we found
a suitor for Aarshi, too.

57
00:11:51,683 --> 00:11:53,116
There she is...
sIeep-waIking again'

58
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:57,120
This disorder couId Iead
to serious compIications.

59
00:11:57,689 --> 00:11:59,122
ShouId she sIeep-waIk even
after she's married...

60
00:11:59,691 --> 00:12:01,124
...her poor husband wouId
have to turn a night-watchman'

61
00:12:01,693 --> 00:12:05,129
-Not a word against my girI...
-She's my daughter, too'

62
00:12:05,697 --> 00:12:09,133
I've toId her to get admitted to
the nature-cure centre at BangaIore.

63
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:11,134
She'II be okay, after just
a six-month course.

64
00:12:11,703 --> 00:12:14,137
But she won't Iisten' And I don't
know what she'II end up doing'

65
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,141
This is no ordinary horse.

66
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:21,211
Its mother, Diana,
has even won the Derby.

67
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:24,213
This horse may win more chaIIenging
races in the days to come.

68
00:12:24,782 --> 00:12:26,215
I decIare the auction open.

69
00:12:26,784 --> 00:12:29,218
-I bid 4 Iakhs'
-four Iakhs... first caII'

70
00:12:29,787 --> 00:12:33,223
-4 Iakhs' The second caII'
-I bid pay 5 Iakhs'

71
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,225
-5 Iakhs, sir'
-six Iakhs'

72
00:12:36,794 --> 00:12:38,227
7 Iakhs'

73
00:12:40,798 --> 00:12:43,232
-8 Iakhs'
-I bid 9 '

74
00:12:44,802 --> 00:12:47,236
-10 Iakhs'
-EIeven Iakhs'

75
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:51,240
15 Iakh Rupees'

76
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:55,245
15 Iakhs indeed'
fifteen Iakhs... the first caII'

77
00:12:55,847 --> 00:12:58,281
15 Iakhs... the second caII'

78
00:12:59,884 --> 00:13:01,317
And the horse is soId
at 15 Iakhs'

79
00:13:01,886 --> 00:13:04,320
Oh, no' You've gone crazy'
You've gone mad'

80
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:06,322
She's bought a horse
for 15 Iakh Rupees'

81
00:13:06,891 --> 00:13:10,327
You'd get 15 horses in as many
Iakhs... with carriages, that is.

82
00:13:10,895 --> 00:13:14,331
Not to forget the money we'd make
from having them pIy the city?

83
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:16,332
-But, dad, it's 15 Iakh...
-Stop the nonsense.

84
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:18,334
You're simpIy bothering
my IittIe girI.

85
00:13:18,903 --> 00:13:23,340
LittIe girI indeed'
She buys a horse for 15 Iakhs...

86
00:13:23,908 --> 00:13:25,341
You've spoiIt her with
aII that pampering, daddy'

87
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,378
Haven't I pampered you, too?

88
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:31,380
And what an iII-mannered brat
you've turned out to be'

89
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,384
Grandpa' You're the onIy one
who reaIIy understands me.

90
00:13:35,953 --> 00:13:40,413
But, teII me, dear... what
did you buy the horse for?

91
00:13:40,992 --> 00:13:42,425
It was onIy because...

92
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,266
CongratuIations'

93
00:13:50,835 --> 00:13:52,268
Look at what Aarshi has brought'

94
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:01,311
PIease, dad... Iet us return'

95
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:05,314
-I won't go on the stage, dad.
-Why not?

96
00:14:05,883 --> 00:14:08,317
Not after the scene Aarshi's
creating with the horse. No, sir'

97
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:12,322
When I can come with an ass in tow,
why can't she bring a horse?

98
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:16,325
Greetings...

99
00:14:22,934 --> 00:14:24,367
It's you... KaiIash? '

100
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:26,369
My God' Isn't that MaIhotra? '

101
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,373
Your wife...? '

102
00:14:30,942 --> 00:14:33,376
-It's ages since we Iast met.
-Must be about 15 years.

103
00:14:33,978 --> 00:14:35,411
That's right. Let's sit down
somewhere and chat.

104
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,414
PIease come aIong, Mrs. MaIhotra.

105
00:14:40,985 --> 00:14:42,418
What's that you've brought?

106
00:14:42,987 --> 00:14:44,420
Mohini had toId me that
Kishore Ioves horses.

107
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:48,425
So, what couId have been a
better wedding-gift for them?

108
00:14:49,994 --> 00:14:53,430
Ever since I've shifted to DeIhi,
I'm aIways busy with my work.

109
00:14:53,998 --> 00:14:55,431
I just don't find time.

110
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,434
Didn't you have a daughter...
Aarshi?

111
00:15:00,037 --> 00:15:03,473
There she is... on the stage.

112
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:08,478
-She's so beautifuI'
-She has grown up, too.

113
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,481
You never know when kids grow up...
As for ourseIves, we're aIways aware.

114
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:22,525
-My son Rohit has grown up, too.
-I see.

115
00:15:23,094 --> 00:15:24,527
He has started a garment-business
in Europe these days.

116
00:15:25,096 --> 00:15:28,532
CouId you have thought of
finding a groom for Aarshi...

117
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,534
Yes... but I haven't
actuaIIy anyone one yet.

118
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:33,536
Something occurred to me just now.

119
00:15:34,105 --> 00:15:36,539
-May I say it, if you don't mind?
-CertainIy' PIease go ahead'

120
00:15:37,108 --> 00:15:39,542
We're Iooking for a bride
for Rohit.

121
00:15:40,178 --> 00:15:42,738
-If the idea appeaIs to you...?
-That's wonderfuI'

122
00:15:43,181 --> 00:15:45,741
For aII you know, God must have
got us to meet again...

123
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:48,778
...to convert our friendship
into a famiIy reIationship'

124
00:15:55,193 --> 00:15:56,785
-Why are You sitting aIone?
-Just simpIy.

125
00:15:59,197 --> 00:16:01,791
What's wrong with her? She was
the Iife of our group at coIIege?

126
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,792
She was aIways so
cheerfuI and fun-Ioving.

127
00:16:04,202 --> 00:16:06,796
I don't know why she has turned
so quiet after marriage.

128
00:16:07,205 --> 00:16:08,797
Why? Is this what marriage
does to women?

129
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:10,799
We'II know that onIy
after we are married.

130
00:16:22,353 --> 00:16:23,945
It's your own refIection'

131
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,955
Do you know how oId your Mom was
when she got married to me?

132
00:16:33,364 --> 00:16:35,958
She must have been about
the same age as you are.

133
00:16:37,368 --> 00:16:42,965
So, I think... it's time
you got married now.

134
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,967
Why, dad? Am I aIready
a burden on you?

135
00:16:47,411 --> 00:16:50,972
My IittIe darIing can
never be a burden on me'

136
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,974
Can anyone ever have a
daughter so IovabIe?

137
00:16:54,418 --> 00:16:56,010
It's a custom for daughters...

138
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,014
...to stay with their parents
tiII they are married.

139
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:02,051
You have to move in with
your husband one day.

140
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,055
Which is why I wanted to know...
Is there someone you Iike?

141
00:17:07,465 --> 00:17:09,057
No. There is no one.

142
00:17:10,468 --> 00:17:12,060
-But I have someone in mind.
-Who is that?

143
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,064
Remember Mr MaIhotra whom we met
at the party Iast night?

144
00:17:15,473 --> 00:17:17,065
He has a son caIIed Rohit.

145
00:17:17,475 --> 00:17:20,069
He runs a thriving garment
business in Europe.

146
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:22,069
In fact, you knew him
as a chiId.

147
00:17:22,513 --> 00:17:25,073
Do you remember the farm-house in
NainitaI which we used to visit...

148
00:17:25,516 --> 00:17:28,110
...that one, where there was
this IittIe wooden-shack?

149
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:30,111
I don't remember.

150
00:17:31,522 --> 00:17:35,117
MaIhotra was teIIing me that
Rohit stiII hasn't forgotten you.

151
00:17:35,526 --> 00:17:37,118
He stiII remembers you.

152
00:22:40,965 --> 00:22:44,560
God has perhaps made us meet
after aII these years...

153
00:22:44,969 --> 00:22:46,561
...so we couId turn our friendship
into a Iasting reIationship.

154
00:22:46,971 --> 00:22:49,565
May we consider this aIIiance
as seaIed then?

155
00:22:49,974 --> 00:22:52,568
CertainIy' Why not?
It's okay with us.

156
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:57,572
I think it wouId be better if Aarshi
couId meet Rohit before that.

157
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:00,641
When is Rohit returning
from Singapore?

158
00:23:01,051 --> 00:23:03,645
He's Ieaving for SwitzerIand
from Singapore tomorrow.

159
00:23:04,054 --> 00:23:05,646
He has started a garment
manufacturing factory there.

160
00:23:06,056 --> 00:23:08,650
I'II send him over to you, the
moment he returns to India.

161
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:11,653
Okay. But couId we have his
photograph in the meantime?

162
00:23:12,062 --> 00:23:13,654
We'II send you a photograph
immediateIy after we reach DeIhi.

163
00:23:16,066 --> 00:23:18,660
Aarshi's getting married. And
I can't ceIebrate with sweets? '

164
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:20,661
Hasn't the doctor forbidden you
from having anything sweet?

165
00:23:21,071 --> 00:23:25,667
See that? ' He vaIues the doctor
more than he Ioves his mother'

166
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,671
I've fed him sweets with my
own hands, when he was a kid.

167
00:23:30,114 --> 00:23:32,674
And he's snatching the sweet-meats
from my hands today'

168
00:23:33,117 --> 00:23:35,711
Is this what I had
brought you up for?

169
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,714
Let her have some...
She's very upset.

170
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:41,750
She's a damn good actress'
That's nothing but a drama'

171
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,751
Don't Iet that worry you.
PIease have some sweets.

172
00:23:48,165 --> 00:23:49,757
I'm not going to do
your pIaits ever again'

173
00:23:51,168 --> 00:23:52,760
That's okay'
I'II do them for you'

174
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:54,762
What? '

175
00:24:12,423 --> 00:24:14,015
How did it happen, Madhu?

176
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:18,020
You know Aarti and Ashok had
an arranged marriage, Aarshi.

177
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:19,020
That's okay. But...

178
00:24:19,463 --> 00:24:22,057
Ashok was a very sweet person
before they were married.

179
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:24,058
But she discovered Iater
that he was a drunkard.

180
00:24:24,468 --> 00:24:27,062
He was even into gambIing
and had a mistress, too.

181
00:24:32,476 --> 00:24:35,070
When she couIdn't take it anymore,
she committed suicide.

182
00:24:36,246 --> 00:24:39,807
You can't go to SwitzerIand
to meet Rohit MaIhotra'

183
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,844
I wiII not get married tiII I have
met Rohit and known him weII.

184
00:24:43,253 --> 00:24:44,845
When have I forbidden you?

185
00:24:45,255 --> 00:24:46,847
TaIk softIy... softIy.

186
00:24:48,258 --> 00:24:50,852
So, okay... wait for him to return
to India. You can meet him then'

187
00:24:51,261 --> 00:24:52,853
Why don't you understand, dad?

188
00:24:53,263 --> 00:24:54,855
In an arranged marriage, when
the boy visits the girI's house...

189
00:24:55,265 --> 00:24:56,857
...he'II aIways pretend
to be a very good man.

190
00:24:57,267 --> 00:24:58,859
Even if he's a drunkard, he can't
waIk in with a bottIe in hand'

191
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:03,907
He won't deaI a hand of cards,
if he's a gambIer.

192
00:25:04,475 --> 00:25:06,909
Neither wiII he bring the girI aIong,
if he's having an affair with her.

193
00:25:07,511 --> 00:25:08,944
That's right'

194
00:25:09,513 --> 00:25:10,946
Which is why I want to meet
Rohit in SwitzerIand.

195
00:25:11,515 --> 00:25:13,949
Do you think he'II show himseIf
for what he is in SwitzerIand?

196
00:25:14,518 --> 00:25:16,952
I won't reveaI my identity to him,
nor teII him why I am in SwitzerIand.

197
00:25:17,521 --> 00:25:18,954
I'II meet him under
an assumed name...

198
00:25:19,523 --> 00:25:21,957
...onIy then wiII I know
what he reaIIy is.

199
00:25:22,526 --> 00:25:23,959
PIease have my tickets
for tomorrow ready.

200
00:25:24,528 --> 00:25:26,962
Okay then... I wiII
accompany you, too'

201
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:30,966
He won't be himseIf, if
he knows who you are.

202
00:25:31,535 --> 00:25:33,969
Besides, I'm not a kid who's going
out by herseIf for the first time.

203
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:36,972
It's necessary for
her to meet him.

204
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:42,044
Who Iistens to me in this house
anyway? Have it your way'

205
00:26:01,665 --> 00:26:03,098
-How are you?
-I'm fine. TeII me about yourseIf.

206
00:26:04,301 --> 00:26:05,734
-How was your fIight?
-AbsoIuteIy great'

207
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,503
-I'm terribIy angry with you.
-Why?

208
00:26:09,106 --> 00:26:10,539
You said we'd get married together.

209
00:26:11,141 --> 00:26:12,574
And here you are... getting
married on your own'

210
00:26:13,143 --> 00:26:16,544
Had I to wait for you, I'd
be a bacheIor aII my Iife'

211
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:26,622
That's my bag'

212
00:26:27,191 --> 00:26:29,625
-When do I meet your fiance?
-Very soon.

213
00:26:30,194 --> 00:26:33,630
Thief' Thief'
CaII the poIice'

214
00:26:34,198 --> 00:26:35,631
-What's up, madam?
-Isn't he a cheeky guy?

215
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,633
He's openIy waIking away
with my Iuggage'

216
00:26:38,202 --> 00:26:39,635
Even airports are
not safe anymore'

217
00:26:40,204 --> 00:26:43,640
You onIy have to bIink...
and your stuff disappears'

218
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:46,676
You Iook as if you beIong
to a decent famiIy...

219
00:26:47,244 --> 00:26:48,677
...but you're into thievery'

220
00:26:49,246 --> 00:26:49,678
A bIoody thief'

221
00:26:50,247 --> 00:26:52,681
There I was at the counter, with
my Iuggage Iying nearby...

222
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:00,722
''Was'' it Iying there...
or ''is'' it stiII there?

223
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:04,726
We have simiIar bags...
So, okay' I've made a mistake.

224
00:27:06,296 --> 00:27:08,730
The thief'

225
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:10,732
She's cooIIy waIking away
with my bags'

226
00:27:11,301 --> 00:27:12,734
Even airports are
not safe anymore'

227
00:27:13,303 --> 00:27:14,736
You onIy have to bIink...
and your stuff disappears'

228
00:27:15,305 --> 00:27:16,738
You Iook as if you beIong
to a decent famiIy.

229
00:27:17,307 --> 00:27:18,740
But you're into thievery'
A bIoody thief'

230
00:27:24,348 --> 00:27:25,781
Wait here, whiIe I go
and get the car.

231
00:27:28,352 --> 00:27:31,788
You've sneezed' That's
bound to ruin my evening'

232
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,793
A singIe sneeze is considered
a curse; two are Iucky.

233
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:40,829
So, pIease sneeze again...
You won't Iose anything.

234
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:42,831
SimpIe'
One sneeze deserves another'

235
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:46,835
I'm not going to Iet
you get away, Madam...

236
00:27:47,404 --> 00:27:48,837
...even if I have to force you
to sneeze again'

237
00:27:49,406 --> 00:27:52,842
Let's have another sneeze...
Come on'

238
00:27:55,445 --> 00:27:57,879
You're second sneeze
was a Iife-saver'

239
00:27:58,448 --> 00:28:02,885
How am I going to repay this debt?
Oh, how am I? '

240
00:28:55,772 --> 00:28:57,205
-You? '
-Is that you? '

241
00:28:59,843 --> 00:29:02,277
Aren't you ashamed to go
around in my cIothes? '

242
00:29:03,847 --> 00:29:05,280
You must have deIiberateIy
swapped the bags'

243
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:08,283
DeIiberateIy, my foot' It has
changed my very appearance'

244
00:29:08,852 --> 00:29:10,285
-Where is my Iuggage?
-It's in there.

245
00:29:12,856 --> 00:29:14,289
Where are you going?

246
00:29:20,864 --> 00:29:24,300
Where is my bag?
I want it right now...

247
00:29:53,964 --> 00:29:55,397
-You're okay, aren't you?
-Yes. I'm fine.

248
00:29:55,966 --> 00:29:58,400
-Have You met Rohit MaIhotra?
-I'm meeting him today.

249
00:29:58,969 --> 00:30:04,407
Today? It's 8.30 Indian-time...
What's the time out there?

250
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,443
What's the time, dear?

251
00:30:09,012 --> 00:30:11,446
-It's 3 p.m.
-3 p.m.?

252
00:30:12,015 --> 00:30:12,447
It's 3 '

253
00:30:38,075 --> 00:30:40,543
-I've got to meet Rohit MaIhotra.
-He's gone out just now.

254
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:43,545
-Where has He gone?
-I don't know. He didn't teII me.

255
00:30:44,114 --> 00:30:46,548
It's important for me
to meet him.

256
00:30:47,117 --> 00:30:49,551
I've come from India
speciaIIy for the purpose.

257
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,557
In that case, go over to
the restaurant tonight.

258
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,558
That is where he eats
every evening.

259
00:36:41,805 --> 00:36:46,401
Know what? You Iook Iike an ass.
And you have the body of a pig'

260
00:36:46,843 --> 00:36:49,403
-Thank you.
-Pardon me? '

261
00:36:49,846 --> 00:36:51,404
-Thank you.
-T-h-a-n-k Y-o-u? '

262
00:37:27,951 --> 00:37:29,543
HeIp me somebody'

263
00:38:05,054 --> 00:38:06,646
Let's go to the hoteI together.

264
00:38:07,056 --> 00:38:09,650
If you come across thugs again,
I won't be abIe to heIp you.

265
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:12,653
Let's go.

266
00:38:15,064 --> 00:38:15,655
Let's go'

267
00:38:16,065 --> 00:38:17,657
You didn't hire those thugs
did you?

268
00:38:19,102 --> 00:38:22,697
Yes' You must've hired them, so you
couId beat them up and impress me.

269
00:38:23,106 --> 00:38:24,698
You've been pestering me
since this morning'

270
00:38:25,108 --> 00:38:26,700
With eyes... that Iook London
and go Tokyo'

271
00:38:29,145 --> 00:38:30,703
WeII, aII right...
I'II be back soon.

272
00:38:31,147 --> 00:38:33,741
Hey... where are you off to?

273
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:37,745
-To caII those thugs again.
-WeII, okay. I beIieve you.

274
00:38:38,154 --> 00:38:40,748
I'm honoured, now that you
have trusted me'

275
00:38:41,157 --> 00:38:43,751
I've mereIy beIieved you...
not trusted you.

276
00:38:49,165 --> 00:38:52,760
How can this be true?
She runs into me and screams'

277
00:38:53,169 --> 00:38:54,761
She takes on the thugs...
and asks for heIp'

278
00:38:55,171 --> 00:38:56,763
And when I heIp her,
she suspects me'

279
00:38:57,173 --> 00:38:59,767
And she beIieves me, when I ask
the thugs to come back'

280
00:39:00,243 --> 00:39:04,805
Can't you shut up? I'm going crazy
Iistening to your nonsense'

281
00:39:05,248 --> 00:39:06,840
Why must you Iisten to me?
I've been taIking to myseIf.

282
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,845
Then shut up and do the
taIking in your mind.

283
00:39:11,254 --> 00:39:13,848
Why must you make me hear it?
You're boring me to death'

284
00:39:14,257 --> 00:39:16,851
-What do You want, after aII?
-I just want you to get Iost'

285
00:39:18,261 --> 00:39:20,855
-Here's a coin.
-What am I going to do with it?

286
00:39:21,264 --> 00:39:22,856
Don't you know the powers
of this fountain?

287
00:39:23,266 --> 00:39:25,860
Just cIose your eyes... and
toss this coin in the fountain.

288
00:39:26,269 --> 00:39:29,864
Your wish wiII be fuIfiIIed.

289
00:40:03,373 --> 00:40:05,967
I want him to disappear
from before me.

290
00:40:18,454 --> 00:40:21,048
You didn't want me in front
of you; So, I waIked behind.

291
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,052
Listen... Iet me waIk ahead.

292
00:40:26,462 --> 00:40:28,054
Or you might say I've
been foIIowing you.

293
00:40:28,464 --> 00:40:31,058
ShouId I waIk behind, you'II
say I've been foIIowing you.

294
00:40:32,468 --> 00:40:34,060
In that case, Iet's waIk together'

295
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:25,211
SIeep-waIking?

296
00:41:38,835 --> 00:41:40,234
Aarshi... that's my room'
Your room...

297
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:45,273
In my room? ' That's fantastic'

298
00:42:27,984 --> 00:42:28,416
What happened?

299
00:42:29,986 --> 00:42:32,420
You now dare to
sIeep in my room? '

300
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:34,422
-I'II caII the manager right now'
-ReIax, Iady'

301
00:42:34,991 --> 00:42:37,425
It's you who wiII get a bad name
if you caII the manager.

302
00:42:37,994 --> 00:42:40,428
Because, I'm not in your room.
''You'' are in my room'

303
00:42:46,002 --> 00:42:50,439
How couId I have sIeep-waIked
into his room? '

304
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:54,443
You know better... if you
did that deIiberateIy.

305
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:02,516
That's me'

306
00:43:03,085 --> 00:43:05,519
How did my picture
Iand with you?

307
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,523
Indeed' You're in
the picture, too'

308
00:43:10,092 --> 00:43:13,528
I Ioved the horse and
picked up the picture'

309
00:43:47,196 --> 00:43:48,629
Hey' Listen...

310
00:43:49,198 --> 00:43:51,632
Now Iook; I'm terribIy angry.
So don't provoke me'

311
00:43:52,201 --> 00:43:54,635
Which is exactIy why
you don't need to jog.

312
00:43:55,204 --> 00:43:56,637
You burn out aII the caIories
with your temper.

313
00:43:57,206 --> 00:43:58,639
There you are... angry again'

314
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:01,676
Do you know that a singIe
second's anger...

315
00:44:02,245 --> 00:44:04,679
...is equivaIent to
an hour's work-out?

316
00:44:05,248 --> 00:44:06,681
-Can't you shut up?
-Okay... teII me this.

317
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,683
At what time are you
sIeep-waIking tonight?

318
00:44:09,252 --> 00:44:10,685
I can keep my door open.

319
00:44:12,255 --> 00:44:13,688
But I must teII you something
before I Ieave.

320
00:44:14,257 --> 00:44:16,691
I Iove the way you exercise.

321
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,696
You can easiIy measure just
how much you have jogged.

322
00:44:21,297 --> 00:44:23,731
-What does That mean?
-Measure it for yourseIf'

323
00:45:41,544 --> 00:45:44,945
PIease have my documents
prepared quickIy, Mr Lad.

324
00:45:45,548 --> 00:45:46,981
I have a consignment
Iying in the customs.

325
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:48,983
Don't worry, sir. I'II have
it ready in 15 minutes.

326
00:45:51,554 --> 00:45:53,988
-Mr Kapoor'
-Mrs. Gayatri? Greetings'

327
00:45:55,558 --> 00:45:56,991
Let's go to my cabin.

328
00:45:58,561 --> 00:46:00,995
Did you read the articIe about M.S.
FertiIisers in the papers today?

329
00:46:01,564 --> 00:46:03,998
-No, I haven't.
-The company's beset with probIems.

330
00:46:04,567 --> 00:46:06,000
And you have aIready bought
many shares in it.

331
00:46:06,569 --> 00:46:09,003
What happens if the shares
turn out to be bogus?

332
00:46:09,572 --> 00:46:11,005
To begin with, such a thing
wiII never happen.

333
00:46:11,574 --> 00:46:14,008
Besides, I'II worry when that
happens. Why Iose sIeep now?

334
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,044
Don't mind this... but you're
very careIess with your business.

335
00:46:17,613 --> 00:46:20,047
I'm not careIess. It's just that
I don't have the time.

336
00:46:20,649 --> 00:46:23,083
We Iose eight days a month
in the week-ends.

337
00:46:23,652 --> 00:46:26,086
Another 4 days go in paying courtesy
caIIs for peopIe who are dead.

338
00:46:26,655 --> 00:46:29,089
I Iose another 4 days
in the beauty-parIour...

339
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:35,096
Now, what can one do in
the rest of the 1 4 days?

340
00:46:36,665 --> 00:46:39,099
Besides, I'm busy fixing
Aarshi's wedding these days.

341
00:46:39,668 --> 00:46:41,101
Whom are you getting
Aarshi married with?

342
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:44,104
It's Rohit. He happens to be
an oId friend, MaIhotra's son.

343
00:48:40,523 --> 00:48:41,956
Is that Aarshi?
How are you?

344
00:48:42,525 --> 00:48:44,959
-I'm fine.
-Did You meet Rohit?

345
00:48:45,528 --> 00:48:47,962
Grandpa' I'm tired of
searching for him.

346
00:48:48,531 --> 00:48:51,967
We don't Iike it here
without you.

347
00:48:52,535 --> 00:48:53,968
I'II teII you what to do.

348
00:48:54,537 --> 00:48:56,971
It's fine, if you happen
to meet Rohit.

349
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:58,973
Or just return home.

350
00:48:59,608 --> 00:49:02,168
I'II definiteIy return,
if I don't meet him today.

351
00:49:04,613 --> 00:49:06,171
Okay... but do take care.

352
00:49:22,364 --> 00:49:25,959
You... do you know Rohit MaIhotra?

353
00:49:27,536 --> 00:49:30,130
Of course. He's a friend of mine.

354
00:49:33,175 --> 00:49:34,767
-I've got to meet Rohit.
-Why?

355
00:49:35,211 --> 00:49:37,805
Leave some stuff?
What does that mean?

356
00:49:39,248 --> 00:49:41,808
He toId me that your Iuggage
got mixed up the other day.

357
00:49:42,251 --> 00:49:44,845
Is that... Rohit MaIhotra then? '

358
00:49:47,256 --> 00:49:48,848
-Didn't you know?
-Not at aII'

359
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:53,528
This is great' You met
Rohit at the airport...

360
00:49:53,729 --> 00:49:55,321
In fact, I've come here
onIy to meet him'

361
00:49:56,031 --> 00:49:57,623
...and even fought with him.

362
00:49:57,833 --> 00:50:00,802
You stay in the room next-door
and are stiII Iooking for Rohit? '

363
00:50:00,936 --> 00:50:02,528
Where can I find Rohit?

364
00:54:01,543 --> 00:54:03,101
Whom were you singing
the song for?

365
00:54:03,545 --> 00:54:06,105
For the horse, of course.

366
00:54:07,549 --> 00:54:10,143
For the horse?
That's a nice joke'

367
00:54:10,552 --> 00:54:12,144
But it was my name
written on the picture.

368
00:54:12,554 --> 00:54:14,146
-Your name?
-Of course'

369
00:54:14,556 --> 00:54:17,150
The caption read,
''Aarshi and The Storm''.

370
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,154
The thought the horse was Aarshi;
you are the storm'

371
00:54:22,598 --> 00:54:24,156
The storm? '

372
00:54:26,602 --> 00:54:31,198
I'm a fooI' And grandpa's right...
I never use my brains'

373
00:54:31,607 --> 00:54:35,202
I didn't ask for your name even
after meeting you so many times'

374
00:54:35,644 --> 00:54:38,204
If onIy I had asked, I wouIdn't have
been put through these probIems.

375
00:54:38,647 --> 00:54:43,243
TeII me... what makes you interested
in my name, aII of a sudden?

376
00:54:43,652 --> 00:54:46,246
ActuaIIy, I've come aII the way
from India onIy to meet you.

377
00:54:47,656 --> 00:54:49,248
Why? I hope I haven't
committed a mistake'

378
00:54:50,659 --> 00:54:53,253
ActuaIIy, you and I...

379
00:54:57,065 --> 00:54:59,659
It's necessary for me to have a
meeting with you, Rohit MaIhotra.

380
00:55:00,102 --> 00:55:02,696
I'm a fashion-designer;
my company wants you...

381
00:55:03,105 --> 00:55:04,697
...to stock the garments
I design.

382
00:55:06,141 --> 00:55:08,701
This is no pIace to
discuss business, madam.

383
00:55:10,312 --> 00:55:12,872
Let's have dinner together
and discuss the matter.

384
00:55:13,315 --> 00:55:14,907
So you've met Rohit MaIhotra,
have you?

385
00:55:15,317 --> 00:55:18,912
Yes, grandpa. He has even
invited me to dinner.

386
00:55:19,555 --> 00:55:21,147
I hope you haven't toId him
anything about yourseIf?

387
00:55:21,557 --> 00:55:24,151
No, grandpa. I want to
check him out first.

388
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,154
It's onIy after I am convinced that
he's not a gambIer and a drunkard...

389
00:55:27,563 --> 00:55:29,155
...wiII I reveaI
my identity to him.

390
00:55:29,565 --> 00:55:31,157
I'II await your teIephone caII.

391
00:55:31,567 --> 00:55:33,159
I wiII caII you. Bye...

392
00:56:08,604 --> 00:56:11,198
-are You gambIing?
-Yes. Join me'

393
00:56:12,641 --> 00:56:15,201
AtIeast wait tiII
I finish these coins.

394
00:56:16,645 --> 00:56:19,239
-How much are the coins worth?
-1 ,000 DoIIars.

395
01:04:39,481 --> 01:04:41,949
Our marriage'

396
01:04:42,517 --> 01:04:45,918
I'm KaiIashnath Kapoor's daughter...

397
01:05:24,025 --> 01:05:27,461
I've faIIen in Iove with you, from
the moment I've set my eyes on you.

398
01:05:28,029 --> 01:05:29,462
But I thought you were
a decent girI.

399
01:05:30,031 --> 01:05:31,464
Thought so?

400
01:05:32,033 --> 01:05:34,467
I was terribIy hurt, when I saw
what you reaIIy are, Iast night.

401
01:05:36,037 --> 01:05:41,475
A woman who drinks and gambIes
can never be my wife.

402
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:44,670
You must forget me, Aarshi.
Just forget me.

403
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:13,732
Rohit' Wait'

404
01:06:23,218 --> 01:06:24,776
Wait...

405
01:06:26,221 --> 01:06:27,813
Wait, Rohit'

406
01:06:38,233 --> 01:06:40,827
I'm not the kind of girI
you think I am'

407
01:06:41,236 --> 01:06:42,828
I was onIy testing you'

408
01:06:43,238 --> 01:06:44,830
Don't create a scene...
Just Iet me go.

409
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,832
But Iisten to me'

410
01:06:48,276 --> 01:06:49,834
But what's wrong with me?

411
01:06:50,278 --> 01:06:51,836
Do I have sharp teeth,
that I might bite?

412
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:53,838
Do I have horns that
might strike you?

413
01:06:54,282 --> 01:06:58,878
Teeth and horns can be taken care of.
But one can't change his ways.

414
01:06:59,287 --> 01:07:04,919
Forgive me' I've made a mistake'
I'm not a gambIer and a drunkard'

415
01:07:06,327 --> 01:07:09,922
Here... Iet me pay for it'
But do forgive me...

416
01:07:10,331 --> 01:07:13,926
I'II never do it again...
But do forgive me'

417
01:07:14,335 --> 01:07:15,927
PIease forgive me'

418
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:20,932
Ask him to Ieave me aIone'

419
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:27,940
Get him to
Ieave me aIone, Rohit'

420
01:08:08,489 --> 01:08:10,081
Don't you know the powers
of this fountain?

421
01:08:10,491 --> 01:08:13,085
Shut your eyes, make a wish,
and toss the coin...

422
01:08:13,494 --> 01:08:15,086
...your wish wiII be fuIfiIIed'

423
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:28,133
Can't you give me a coin? '

424
01:08:28,576 --> 01:08:31,136
PIease Iet me have a coin...
PIease' Just one...

425
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:36,140
MiserIy beggars'

426
01:08:36,584 --> 01:08:39,178
Give me a coin... pIease'

427
01:08:55,603 --> 01:08:59,198
PIease come back to me, Rohit'

428
01:10:12,346 --> 01:10:13,938
CongratuIations'

429
01:10:16,117 --> 01:10:19,712
Have you toId Jamie everything
about aII your oId affairs?

430
01:10:20,121 --> 01:10:22,715
I've hidden nothing...
But have you toId Aarshi everything?

431
01:10:23,124 --> 01:10:25,718
Now, Jamie' I know
everything about Rohit'

432
01:10:26,127 --> 01:10:27,719
I've known him for many years.

433
01:10:28,129 --> 01:10:29,721
We even used to pIay together
as kids...

434
01:10:30,131 --> 01:10:32,725
And you mustn't try to
start a fight between us'

435
01:10:37,138 --> 01:10:40,733
ShaII we Ieave, Rohit?
I've got to teIephone my Dad...

436
01:10:41,175 --> 01:10:45,771
...and ask him to meet your parents
and finaIise a wedding date.

437
01:10:56,224 --> 01:10:57,782
What is the matter?

438
01:11:01,229 --> 01:11:02,821
I Iove you very much...

439
01:11:06,234 --> 01:11:10,830
...but I have Iied to you.

440
01:11:11,272 --> 01:11:12,830
-Lied to me?
-Yes.

441
01:11:15,276 --> 01:11:17,836
I am not Rohit MaIhotra.

442
01:11:20,281 --> 01:11:21,873
You're joking again'

443
01:11:23,284 --> 01:11:24,876
I'm teIIing you the truth.

444
01:11:34,295 --> 01:11:35,887
I am not Rohit MaIhotra.

445
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:38,924
My name is Bobby Oberoi.

446
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:43,929
What was that...?
Aren't you Rohit MaIhotra? '

447
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:48,933
Are you not Rohit MaIhotra? '

448
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:04,682
Everything I did...

449
01:12:15,102 --> 01:12:16,694
-Hear me out, Aarshi...
-I wiII Iisten to nothing'

450
01:12:20,174 --> 01:12:21,698
You Iied to me'

451
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:38,783
You're a Iiar, Rohit MaIhotra...

452
01:12:41,195 --> 01:12:44,790
You're a Iiar, Bobby Oberoi'
A Iiar'

453
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,795
You're a Iiar'

454
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:01,814
Aarshi, my chiId'
What's wrong?

455
01:13:04,385 --> 01:13:05,818
-What's wrong?
-She's crying'

456
01:13:08,389 --> 01:13:09,822
What's wrong, dear?
Why are you crying?

457
01:13:13,394 --> 01:13:14,827
-Did You meet him and taIk to him?
-No'

458
01:13:17,398 --> 01:13:19,832
-does He drink?
-No'

459
01:13:20,434 --> 01:13:22,868
-is He a gambIer?
-No.

460
01:13:23,437 --> 01:13:24,870
-Is He having an affair then?
-No'

461
01:13:25,439 --> 01:13:27,873
Then what are you crying for?

462
01:13:28,442 --> 01:13:30,910
Neither is he a drinker,
nor does he gambIe...

463
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,913
...he's not even Rohit MaIhotra'

464
01:13:34,482 --> 01:13:38,885
What? ' If Rohit MaIhotra is
not himseIf, then who is he?

465
01:13:39,487 --> 01:13:40,920
He has betrayed me'

466
01:13:41,489 --> 01:13:42,922
Who has betrayed you?

467
01:13:43,491 --> 01:13:44,924
Rohit MaIhotra has'

468
01:13:45,493 --> 01:13:47,927
But you just said that Rohit
MaIhotra is not Rohit MaIhotra'

469
01:13:48,496 --> 01:13:50,930
It was the fake Rohit MaIhotra'

470
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,934
This is a bit too much, dear...
Just return now.

471
01:13:55,503 --> 01:13:57,937
Yes. That wouId be right, I guess.

472
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:01,940
Forget it, dear...
Just forget it aII'

473
01:14:03,577 --> 01:14:05,135
WeII, okay...

474
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:08,138
And teII me which fIight
you're taking.

475
01:14:08,582 --> 01:14:12,177
Very weII, grandpa.

476
01:14:14,588 --> 01:14:15,179
What's happening out there?

477
01:14:15,589 --> 01:14:18,183
How can't Rohit MaIhotra
be Rohit MaIhotra?

478
01:14:18,592 --> 01:14:20,184
Hows that possibIe?

479
01:14:35,643 --> 01:14:36,200
Hear me out, Aarshi.

480
01:14:38,646 --> 01:14:42,275
TeII me, sir, is it okay to punish
someone without knowing the truth?

481
01:14:42,683 --> 01:14:45,277
A Iiar can onIy Iie...
He can never speak the truth'

482
01:14:45,686 --> 01:14:47,278
I'II teII you the truth.

483
01:14:47,688 --> 01:14:50,282
You don't need to...
Just Iisten to me.

484
01:14:50,691 --> 01:14:52,283
It aII began when I feII
in Iove with her.

485
01:14:52,693 --> 01:14:54,285
And this girI wouIdn't
even taIk to me'

486
01:14:54,695 --> 01:14:57,289
I got to know then that she was
here in search of Rohit MaIhotra.

487
01:14:57,698 --> 01:14:59,290
I thought the onIy way
to move cIoser to her...

488
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:02,294
...was by myseIf
posing as Rohit'

489
01:15:02,703 --> 01:15:05,297
And teII you what?
She's feigning aII that anger'

490
01:15:05,706 --> 01:15:08,300
-She Ioves me Very much, too.
-I hate him'

491
01:15:20,788 --> 01:15:21,345
Wait there, darIing...

492
01:19:37,691 --> 01:19:39,124
PIease don't Ieave me.

493
01:19:42,629 --> 01:19:46,030
What are you punishing me for?
For being in Iove with you?

494
01:19:48,101 --> 01:19:49,534
Or is it because I am
not Rohit MaIhotra?

495
01:20:19,299 --> 01:20:20,698
-ReaIIy?
-Yes. I'm a fashion-designer.

496
01:20:21,801 --> 01:20:24,395
My company has sent me here
to meet you.

497
01:20:24,771 --> 01:20:27,365
-You're returning to India.
-Not at aII.

498
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,032
Here at the airport? You're
even carrying your Iuggage.

499
01:20:30,777 --> 01:20:34,372
I came here to receive my assistant,
who has fIown in from India.

500
01:20:36,116 --> 01:20:38,710
It's important for me to discuss
something with you, Mr Rohit.

501
01:20:41,421 --> 01:20:43,013
I'm very tired right now.

502
01:20:45,258 --> 01:20:46,816
I'm staying at the HoIiday Inn;
Iet's meet for Iunch then.

503
01:21:10,884 --> 01:21:13,478
I did go to the airport, grandpa.
But I met Rohit MaIhotra there.

504
01:21:15,388 --> 01:21:17,982
Didn't you teII me that
he was not Rohit MaIhotra'

505
01:21:18,558 --> 01:21:21,118
That was a fake;
This one is the reaI chap.

506
01:21:25,498 --> 01:21:28,092
I'm meeting him at Iunch. I'II
caII you, after I've met him.

507
01:21:28,168 --> 01:21:29,760
Isn't Aarshi returning?

508
01:21:29,836 --> 01:21:33,431
She says sometimes that she
has found Rohit MaIhotra.

509
01:21:35,275 --> 01:21:38,870
At yet other times, she says
that Rohit MaIhotra is a fake.

510
01:21:38,945 --> 01:21:42,540
And now she says that she has
met the reaI Rohit MaIhotra'

511
01:21:44,417 --> 01:21:47,011
I wonder how many Rohit MaIhotra's
she's going to meet'

512
01:21:59,065 --> 01:22:00,657
Why have you come here?

513
01:22:02,035 --> 01:22:04,629
You're going to meet Rohit
MaIhotra today, Aarshi.

514
01:22:10,076 --> 01:22:11,668
...you're Iooking for in a husband.

515
01:22:12,779 --> 01:22:14,371
My happiness Iies in
your happiness, after aII.

516
01:22:16,416 --> 01:22:21,012
And I wish that when Rohit MaIhotra
sets his eyes on you today...

517
01:22:27,427 --> 01:22:29,987
...he must feeI as if he is taIking
to a beauty from the heavens.

518
01:22:32,766 --> 01:22:34,358
I've brought this dress for you.

519
01:22:35,568 --> 01:22:38,162
You'II Iook beautifuI
when you wear it.

520
01:23:22,215 --> 01:23:24,809
Strange' Don't you even
have champagne? '

521
01:23:25,218 --> 01:23:26,810
But I'm fond of Iiquor...

522
01:23:29,255 --> 01:23:31,815
Do you drink during
the daytime, too?

523
01:23:32,258 --> 01:23:33,816
Who says you shouIdn't be
drinking at daytime?

524
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:35,818
But, stiII...
To be drinking during the day...

525
01:23:36,262 --> 01:23:38,856
I don't care for aII that.
I drink, when I feeI Iike it.

526
01:23:50,310 --> 01:23:51,902
It has Iost?

527
01:23:52,312 --> 01:23:55,907
In that case, bet 2 Iakh DoIIars
on the fiIIy CIeopatra, okay?

528
01:23:57,317 --> 01:23:59,911
-Do You aIso gambIe?
-GambIing is my passion.

529
01:24:01,321 --> 01:24:02,913
How much couId you
have Iost?

530
01:24:04,357 --> 01:24:06,917
-About a Iakh Of DoIIars.
-One Iakh DoIIars? '

531
01:24:08,361 --> 01:24:09,919
What do I earn the money for?

532
01:24:12,365 --> 01:24:13,957
And I am having a great time'

533
01:24:14,367 --> 01:24:17,962
With the money you Iose in gambIing
in one singIe day, Rohit...

534
01:24:19,372 --> 01:24:22,967
...a poor man couId
spend an entire Iifetime.

535
01:24:23,376 --> 01:24:28,006
He couId feed his chiIdren
and Iead a comfortabIe Iife.

536
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:04,075
She wouIdn't want to see
Rohit MaIhotra's face again'

537
01:25:04,484 --> 01:25:07,078
-That was a cIass act, wasn't it?
-Sure, It was.

538
01:25:10,557 --> 01:25:12,115
Didn't I reaIIy
puII it off for you?

539
01:25:19,866 --> 01:25:21,458
I'm very fond of acting.

540
01:25:21,868 --> 01:25:23,460
You'II get me a break in
fiIms in Bombay, won't you?

541
01:25:24,871 --> 01:25:25,462
You're a great actor.

542
01:25:25,872 --> 01:25:29,467
Just come down to Bombay. I'II get
you a roIe in Subhash Ghai's fiIm.

543
01:25:39,919 --> 01:25:43,514
I didn't want you
to return, Aarshi.

544
01:25:55,001 --> 01:25:56,593
PIease Iisten to me'

545
01:25:58,705 --> 01:26:00,297
Hear me out first... pIease'

546
01:35:52,264 --> 01:35:53,697
Bobby is returning
after 8 years'

547
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:56,794
He'II be disappointed, if he
doesn't find me at the airport.

548
01:35:57,136 --> 01:35:59,730
I know that. But we must submit this
report to the Reserve Bank today.

549
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:02,273
PIease go through it
and sign it.

550
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:08,747
You'd better go the airport
and bring Bobby home then.

551
01:36:09,849 --> 01:36:11,282
I'II meet you there.

552
01:36:16,856 --> 01:36:19,324
-Grandpa'
-Aarshi' My chiId'

01:36:25,931 --> 01:36:27,364
Greetings, sir.

554
01:36:30,936 --> 01:36:32,369
-Hasn't Mom come?
-She'II meet you at home.

555
01:36:35,941 --> 01:36:37,374
Are you Gayatri Devi's son?

556
01:36:38,944 --> 01:36:39,376
-Yes, sir.
-I see.

557
01:36:40,412 --> 01:36:42,846
I know your mother very weII.
Do convey my regards to her.

558
01:36:43,949 --> 01:36:46,383
CertainIy. I must Ieave now.
Bye...

559
01:36:48,954 --> 01:36:51,388
-Did You meet him on the fIight?
-I met him in SwitzerIand.

560
01:36:53,459 --> 01:36:55,893
What are you up to? '
Have you gone mad?

561
01:36:56,996 --> 01:37:00,397
Set me down... I might faII'

562
01:37:02,334 --> 01:37:04,928
I'm gIad you've returned, too.

563
01:37:06,038 --> 01:37:09,633
You wiII attend office from tomorrow
and take over the business.

564
01:37:10,342 --> 01:37:12,936
In aII those years you've
spent abroad, Bobby...

565
01:37:13,345 --> 01:37:14,937
...did you ever remember me?

566
01:37:15,347 --> 01:37:20,944
It's memories of you, aII
through the day and night...

567
01:37:21,353 --> 01:37:27,952
It's your name that
I even breathe...

568
01:37:29,094 --> 01:37:32,689
Were you there for a management
course, or was it for singing?

569
01:37:37,102 --> 01:37:39,696
-Yes.
-What is her name?

570
01:37:41,106 --> 01:37:41,697
Daughter of KaiIashnath Kapoor,
of Kapoor Industries.

571
01:37:42,141 --> 01:37:44,735
KaiIashnath Kapoor's daughter?

572
01:37:45,444 --> 01:37:53,044
But wasn't she going to marry
an industriaIist of DeIhi...

573
01:37:53,452 --> 01:37:55,044
...someone caIIed Rohit MaIhotra?

574
01:37:55,454 --> 01:37:57,046
But I am Rohit MaIhotra'

575
01:37:57,489 --> 01:38:00,049
What? ' You're Rohit MaIhotra? '

576
01:38:00,492 --> 01:38:02,050
That's a Iong story, Mom.

577
01:38:02,494 --> 01:38:06,089
To cut a Iong story short,
Aarshi and I Iove each other.

578
01:38:06,498 --> 01:38:11,094
Good boy' I don't have to worry
about finding a daughter-in-Iaw'

579
01:38:11,503 --> 01:38:15,098
WeII, then... when do
I get to meet Aarshi?

580
01:38:16,208 --> 01:38:18,802
Okay... I'II be there
tomorrow morning.

581
01:38:22,581 --> 01:38:24,139
You've had your way,
haven't you?

582
01:38:24,550 --> 01:38:27,144
Rohit MaIhotra couId have come here'
But who Iistens to me?

583
01:38:27,553 --> 01:38:29,145
-I tried to find him, Dad...
-I'II caII MaIhotra today...

584
01:38:29,555 --> 01:38:31,147
...and have Rohit come
down here today itseIf.

585
01:38:32,291 --> 01:38:33,849
I'm fed of the name, dad...

586
01:38:39,298 --> 01:38:40,890
Good-night, Grandpa...
Good-night, grandma.

587
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:44,194
There... haven't you spoiIt her
with aII your pampering?

588
01:38:44,603 --> 01:38:46,195
Does she obey anything
I say?

589
01:38:46,605 --> 01:38:49,199
She's had a Iong fIight...
It must be the jet-Iag, you know.

590
01:38:49,608 --> 01:38:51,200
I'II taIk to her
tomorrow morning.

591
01:38:51,610 --> 01:38:53,202
Go and do your pIaits.

592
01:38:53,612 --> 01:38:57,207
-Do my pIaits today, Mom.
-Very weII.

593
01:38:58,317 --> 01:38:59,909
-Must I do It for you?
-Do it for yourseIf'

594
01:39:03,222 --> 01:39:05,690
WeIcome, madam...

595
01:39:06,692 --> 01:39:09,252
-What have You worn?
-Why? What's wrong with it?

596
01:39:10,396 --> 01:39:12,990
You don't know my Mom...
She's very conservative.

597
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:15,992
-Ram Singh'
-Yes, sir?

598
01:39:20,706 --> 01:39:22,298
-What are You doing?
-You're meeting Mom today.

599
01:39:22,708 --> 01:39:24,300
You'd better have
your head covered.

600
01:39:24,710 --> 01:39:26,302
You wouIdn't know this...
but she has a nasty temper.

601
01:39:27,413 --> 01:39:32,009
-I'd better Ieave...
-Don't worry' Just come aIong.

602
01:39:35,721 --> 01:39:38,315
The first thing you must do
is to faII at her feet.

603
01:39:38,757 --> 01:39:40,315
Give her an answer smiIingIy,
shouId she ask you something.

604
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:42,017
And faII at her feet again.

605
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:51,861
Go on'

606
01:39:54,273 --> 01:39:56,867
-What's wrong with Ram Singh?
-It's Aarshi... not Ram Singh'

607
01:39:59,044 --> 01:40:01,638
Why is she wearing the turban?

608
01:40:02,281 --> 01:40:04,875
How couId I have come
bare-headed to you?

609
01:40:06,285 --> 01:40:07,877
Get up now... that's enough.

610
01:40:10,055 --> 01:40:14,651
I've got just the daughter-in-Iaw
I aIways dreamed of.

611
01:40:15,094 --> 01:40:17,654
-I onIy need your bIessings'
-get up.

612
01:40:18,130 --> 01:40:21,725
My bIessings wiII aIways
remain with you.

613
01:40:22,167 --> 01:40:23,725
Have you toId your father
about this?

614
01:40:24,369 --> 01:40:25,961
I wondered if you couId
break the news to him...?

615
01:40:27,372 --> 01:40:30,967
Get up, dear...
Come and sit down with me.

616
01:40:33,145 --> 01:40:37,741
Go and teII your father that you've
faIIen in Iove with this rascaI'

617
01:40:38,150 --> 01:40:41,745
He has introduced you to me and
is aIready puIIing your Ieg'

618
01:40:42,154 --> 01:40:45,749
Don't you dare harass my
daughter-in-Iaw, Bobby'

619
01:40:46,425 --> 01:40:47,983
-What have I done?
-That's enough'

620
01:40:49,428 --> 01:40:51,988
Sit here, dear... I'II be back
in a moment.

621
01:40:56,201 --> 01:40:58,795
-You've made a fooI out of me'
-What have I done? '

622
01:40:59,204 --> 01:41:00,796
FaII at her feet when
I meet her, eh?

623
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:03,032
What's wrong with that?

624
01:41:06,478 --> 01:41:10,073
You made me Iook Iike a fooI'
I won't Iet you escape today'

625
01:41:11,250 --> 01:41:12,842
Mother'

626
01:41:13,252 --> 01:41:14,844
Don't stop... go ahead
and beat him up'

627
01:41:15,254 --> 01:41:16,846
-Mother? '
-Oh, shut up'

628
01:41:17,489 --> 01:41:22,085
You deserve it' I'm gIad there's
someone who can beat you up'

629
01:41:23,529 --> 01:41:25,087
Let me see your hand, dear.

630
01:41:32,304 --> 01:41:33,896
What is this bangIe for?

631
01:41:34,306 --> 01:41:36,900
When my mother-in-Iaw saw me
for the first time...

632
01:41:37,543 --> 01:41:39,135
...it was this very bangIe
that she made me wear.

633
01:41:51,390 --> 01:41:53,950
-Have You asked Aarshi something?
-What couId I ask her?

634
01:41:54,393 --> 01:41:56,953
She went out earIy this morning.
I'II ask her, when she returns.

635
01:41:57,629 --> 01:42:00,223
Grandpa' Grandma'

636
01:42:01,633 --> 01:42:03,225
Here are some sweets for you...

637
01:42:07,639 --> 01:42:10,233
-What's up?
-I've got engaged.

638
01:42:11,410 --> 01:42:15,005
-What? '
-Have you got engaged? '

639
01:42:15,414 --> 01:42:19,009
-Yes'
-Whom have You got engaged to?

640
01:42:19,418 --> 01:42:25,050
Didn't you meet Bobby Oberoi
at the airport? It's him.

641
01:42:25,490 --> 01:42:26,047
That boy?

642
01:42:26,491 --> 01:42:29,051
Why didn't you teII us
about him earIier?

643
01:42:29,494 --> 01:42:34,090
I thought I'd teII you when Bobby's
mother approved of the match, too.

644
01:42:34,499 --> 01:42:36,091
I've just met her...

645
01:42:36,501 --> 01:42:39,095
...and Iook at the bangIe
she has given me.

646
01:42:39,504 --> 01:42:42,098
My God' How the times
have changed'

647
01:42:42,507 --> 01:42:45,101
Not onIy did she go
and fix her marriage...

648
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:47,102
...but she has even accepted
the token of aIIiance'

649
01:42:47,512 --> 01:42:50,106
We must consider ourseIves Iucky.

650
01:42:50,515 --> 01:42:53,109
There are girIs who first
have a honeymoon...

651
01:42:53,518 --> 01:42:55,110
...and then teII their parents
that they are married.

652
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:57,112
But what happens of the word
KaiIash has given to the MaIhotra's?

653
01:42:57,522 --> 01:42:59,114
I'II taIk to KaiIash.

654
01:42:59,558 --> 01:43:01,116
It's the question of our
grand-daughter's Iife.

655
01:43:01,593 --> 01:43:04,153
She must decide whom she
wants to spend her Iife with.

656
01:43:04,596 --> 01:43:07,190
KaiIash might agree to turn down
Rohit, if you taIk to him.

657
01:43:07,833 --> 01:43:12,429
But he wiII not agree to the wedding
unIess he has met Bobby.

658
01:43:12,904 --> 01:43:14,496
That is the first sensibIe thing
you have ever spoken.

659
01:43:14,906 --> 01:43:19,502
Very weII, then. I'II teII KaiIash
everything tonight.

660
01:43:20,145 --> 01:43:22,739
But see that you bring Bobby
to meet KaiIash tomorrow.

661
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:03,412
I hope you are not
Iaughing at me?

662
01:44:06,491 --> 01:44:08,083
It's just your...

663
01:44:08,327 --> 01:44:11,922
What's so funny? Have you
never seen hair before?

664
01:44:12,364 --> 01:44:13,922
Sure, I have.
But never on such a head'

665
01:44:16,301 --> 01:44:17,859
May I give you a suggestion?

666
01:44:18,036 --> 01:44:20,630
You ought to tie your hair
in a bun; not in a pIait'

667
01:44:20,872 --> 01:44:23,466
A round head...
a moon-Iike baIdness and a bun'

668
01:44:38,924 --> 01:44:41,518
Let me pIant this rose in his pIait;
it'II enhance his ''beauty''.

669
01:44:45,464 --> 01:44:48,024
Come aIong... don't worry'

670
01:44:48,467 --> 01:44:51,027
And don't forget to faII at my
father's feet, when you meet him'

671
01:44:51,470 --> 01:44:54,064
-Here's Bobby, grandma.
-My respects, grandma.

672
01:44:54,473 --> 01:44:58,068
May you have a Iong Iife'
Sit down, son.

673
01:45:00,612 --> 01:45:01,203
I'II go and caII Dad.

674
01:45:02,047 --> 01:45:03,639
-Hows your Mom?
-She's fine.

675
01:45:03,815 --> 01:45:06,409
-Why hasn't she come, too?
-Dad wants to see me first.

676
01:45:06,551 --> 01:45:08,109
How can anyone have
a name Iike that?

677
01:45:09,521 --> 01:45:12,115
Looks good with that hair...
Why doesn't he have a pIait too?

678
01:45:15,026 --> 01:45:16,618
-I've got to Ieave'
-Wait a minute'

679
01:45:20,632 --> 01:45:22,190
-How are You, my boy?
-I'm fine.

680
01:45:22,801 --> 01:45:25,361
The Iast time I saw you,
you were stiII a kid.

681
01:45:26,438 --> 01:45:28,030
A kid'

682
01:45:28,140 --> 01:45:29,732
I've known your Mom
for many years, son.

683
01:45:30,175 --> 01:45:31,767
We have aII our accounts
in her bank.

684
01:45:32,010 --> 01:45:33,602
I know that.

685
01:45:33,979 --> 01:45:36,573
What are you hiding
your face for?

686
01:45:36,848 --> 01:45:38,440
-I'm feeIing shy'
-Why feeI shy Of me?

687
01:45:40,786 --> 01:45:42,378
Mustn't I see how
my son-in-Iaw Iooks?

688
01:45:42,554 --> 01:45:45,148
Why must you, sir? Your daughter
has approved of me...

689
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:49,886
Take off your hands, son...
That's okay.

690
01:45:50,095 --> 01:45:51,687
Let me see your face'
TerribIy shy chap, I must say'

691
01:45:55,667 --> 01:45:57,225
I'II shut my eyes then, okay?

692
01:46:00,172 --> 01:46:02,766
-May I open my eyes now?
-No'

693
01:46:29,134 --> 01:46:30,533
Dad seems to have
Iiked you very much'

694
01:46:31,670 --> 01:46:33,103
ReaIIy? Then what has he
gone inside for?

695
01:46:33,605 --> 01:46:35,038
He must've gone to fetch
a souvenir for you.

696
01:46:47,052 --> 01:46:48,485
What are you doing?

697
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:53,057
That's good' Or, I'd have
been a murderer today'

698
01:46:53,191 --> 01:46:54,624
-is He dead?
-He's run away'

699
01:46:55,227 --> 01:46:56,660
What about my marriage, Papa?

700
01:46:57,762 --> 01:46:59,229
You can never marry that rascaI'

701
01:46:59,698 --> 01:47:03,099
He poked fun at my pIaits
the other day, Mom'

702
01:47:03,335 --> 01:47:07,738
You're not wrong, you know.
Mr KaiIashnath does Iook strange.

703
01:47:11,042 --> 01:47:12,475
Buthow often have
I warned you...

704
01:47:12,711 --> 01:47:15,145
...not to provoke peopIe
you meet everywhere?

705
01:47:15,547 --> 01:47:18,983
How was I to know that he's Aarshi's
father? What am I going to do now?

706
01:47:22,554 --> 01:47:24,988
What wiII you do now,
my friend?

707
01:47:32,998 --> 01:47:34,431
Mr Bobby Oberoi is here
to see you, sir.

708
01:47:34,766 --> 01:47:37,200
I don't know anyone
of that name'

709
01:47:37,435 --> 01:47:40,836
If anyone cIaims to be Bobby Oberoi
just throw him out'

710
01:47:43,608 --> 01:47:46,042
-What if He stiII comes inside?
-I'II shoot...

711
01:47:50,315 --> 01:47:54,752
I've come to apoIogise, sir.
I reaIise my mistake now.

712
01:47:56,321 --> 01:47:58,755
If anything, you have
an exceIIent hair-styIe'

713
01:47:59,324 --> 01:48:01,758
No wonder then that I've tied
my hair in a pIait, too'

714
01:48:02,327 --> 01:48:04,761
-It's smaIIer than yours though.
-Poking fun at my pIait again'

715
01:48:06,831 --> 01:48:08,264
Just go away, or
I'II gun you down'

716
01:48:08,867 --> 01:48:12,268
She'II be a spinster and an orphan,
too, after you're hanged'

717
01:48:12,504 --> 01:48:13,937
What wiII happen of Aarshi,
if you kiII me?

718
01:48:18,209 --> 01:48:19,642
I'm not about to go away
tiII you consent to it'

719
01:48:19,878 --> 01:48:22,312
Very weII then... I'II go away'

720
01:48:22,714 --> 01:48:24,147
But I wiII not toIerate
two pIaits in this house'

721
01:48:28,753 --> 01:48:30,152
What am I going to do now?

722
01:48:48,039 --> 01:48:49,472
Greetings, grandma.

723
01:48:50,542 --> 01:48:51,975
It's you, Bobby?

724
01:48:52,644 --> 01:48:55,078
I've made an offering here, grandma.
Have some...

725
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:57,914
-I can't have that.
-Why not?

726
01:48:58,717 --> 01:49:00,150
I suffer from excess sugar.

727
01:49:00,852 --> 01:49:04,288
Besides, KaiIash has made me promise
that I'II never touch sweets.

728
01:49:04,522 --> 01:49:06,956
He has asked you not to
have sweets, grandma.

729
01:49:07,525 --> 01:49:10,961
He couIdn't have asked you
not to have sacred offerings.

730
01:49:13,565 --> 01:49:14,998
And that which is had in God's name
is neither sweet nor sour...

731
01:49:15,567 --> 01:49:17,000
...it's just what it is;
God's own offering.

732
01:49:17,869 --> 01:49:19,302
It's a sin to turn down
the hoIy offering.

733
01:49:19,704 --> 01:49:21,137
You're a good boy.

734
01:49:21,573 --> 01:49:23,006
-You Must do something for me.
-What is that?

735
01:49:24,042 --> 01:49:26,476
Ask Aarshi not to caII me
at my house.

736
01:49:26,911 --> 01:49:29,345
-She won't find me there anymore.
-Are You going somewhere then?

737
01:49:29,581 --> 01:49:31,014
Where can I go?

738
01:49:31,583 --> 01:49:35,019
This pIace shaII now be my home...

739
01:49:35,587 --> 01:49:38,021
I'II spend the rest of my Iife
in the care of the Lord.

740
01:49:38,590 --> 01:49:43,027
What are you saying? This is
no age to sound so dejected'

741
01:49:43,628 --> 01:49:48,065
Aarshi and I cannot Iive
without each other, grandma.

742
01:49:48,667 --> 01:49:51,101
Why can't you ask your son
to forget his anger...

743
01:49:51,670 --> 01:49:53,103
...and agree to our marriage?

744
01:49:53,571 --> 01:49:58,008
He's an eccentric chap, as it is.
And you had to provoke him'

745
01:49:58,677 --> 01:50:02,113
And when wiII you heIp? There's
no one greater than a grandmother'

746
01:50:04,082 --> 01:50:05,515
What can't you do,
if you make up your mind?

747
01:50:06,184 --> 01:50:08,618
It's beyond me now.

748
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:12,356
My son has even caIIed the
MaIhotra's for dinner tonight.

749
01:50:12,691 --> 01:50:14,124
They are aIready in Bombay.

750
01:50:14,759 --> 01:50:18,195
He'II fix Aarshi's wedding
with Rohit today.

751
01:50:18,930 --> 01:50:21,364
That can't be true, grandma'
I'd die, if that happens'

752
01:50:21,866 --> 01:50:26,269
I promise to give you sweets...
I mean, offerings, aII my Iife'

753
01:50:26,738 --> 01:50:28,171
You wiII have to somehow
staII this aIIiance'

754
01:50:31,776 --> 01:50:36,213
Very weII then...
I'II do something about it.

755
01:50:38,883 --> 01:50:40,316
You're worrying for no reason'

756
01:50:41,286 --> 01:50:42,719
Here you are... it's finaI,
as far as I am concerned.

757
01:50:43,788 --> 01:50:46,222
Once Aarshi has met Rohit,
it'II be taken care of'

758
01:50:46,791 --> 01:50:51,228
I'II bIess you onIy after
I've seen your passport.

759
01:50:51,796 --> 01:50:54,264
Why wouId he bring
his passport here?

760
01:50:54,833 --> 01:50:57,267
In that case, I insist on
Iooking up your Ration Card.

761
01:50:59,003 --> 01:51:00,436
-What's that you're saying, Mom?
-Shut up'

762
01:51:00,872 --> 01:51:04,308
-a passport... ration-card...
-We don't understand.

763
01:51:04,809 --> 01:51:09,246
It's important to confirm that
this boy is reaIIy Rohit MaIhotra

764
01:51:10,115 --> 01:51:11,548
I confirm that, Mom...
He's reaIIy Rohit MaIhotra'

765
01:51:11,783 --> 01:51:14,217
Just keep out of this.

766
01:51:14,385 --> 01:51:17,821
ActuaIIy, Aarshi had been
to Europe some days ago.

767
01:51:17,889 --> 01:51:21,325
She met a boy there who said
he was Rohit MaIhotra.

768
01:51:21,893 --> 01:51:25,329
After they got together and had fun,
sang the customary songs, etc...

769
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:28,364
...she got to know that
he was not Rohit MaIhotra'

770
01:51:30,969 --> 01:51:32,402
-What are you saying? '
-Shut up'

771
01:51:33,438 --> 01:51:34,871
Aarshi then met another boy.

772
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:36,873
Just shut up'

773
01:51:38,143 --> 01:51:41,579
He aIso cIaimed
to be Rohit MaIhotra.

774
01:51:41,813 --> 01:51:44,247
They again went around together,
singing those romantic songs.

775
01:51:44,783 --> 01:51:47,217
She once again got to know that
the chap was a fraud, too'

776
01:51:47,919 --> 01:51:48,351
This is the third chap
in a row.

777
01:51:49,487 --> 01:51:51,921
What if there are fourths
and fifths Iater?

778
01:51:52,190 --> 01:51:55,626
-What are you saying, Mom? '
-What are You crying for, my son?

779
01:51:55,794 --> 01:51:58,228
What worse can they do,
than to refuse the aIIiance...

780
01:51:58,863 --> 01:52:00,296
...after they've heard
of aII this?

781
01:52:00,632 --> 01:52:02,065
But we've got cIear the air,
don't we?

782
01:52:02,367 --> 01:52:07,771
It's nice of you to have
toId us the truth.

783
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:10,573
-Anyone Can make a mistake.
-That's right.

784
01:52:10,708 --> 01:52:14,144
We'II forgive her, even if she
makes a mistake after marriage.

785
01:52:14,345 --> 01:52:16,779
My God' What a shameIess famiIy'

786
01:52:17,048 --> 01:52:19,482
How couId you agree to the wedding,
even after knowing the truth?

787
01:52:20,051 --> 01:52:23,487
I can't get my grand-daughter
married in such a shameIess famiIy'

788
01:52:26,090 --> 01:52:26,522
Let's go, Aarshi'

789
01:52:27,091 --> 01:52:30,527
PIease forgive me, MaIhotra.

790
01:52:31,095 --> 01:52:34,531
I had to go out for two days and
you even severed the aIIiance'

791
01:52:35,133 --> 01:52:37,567
-He poked fun at my hair-styIe'
-Poked fun, my foot'

792
01:52:38,136 --> 01:52:40,570
What's wrong with pIanting
a rose in your pIait?

793
01:52:41,139 --> 01:52:43,573
WouId you Iike it, if someone
did that to your hair?

794
01:52:45,143 --> 01:52:46,576
I'II cut those cursed pIaits,
I teII you'

795
01:52:47,145 --> 01:52:49,579
Aarshi, my chiId...
Don't worry'

796
01:52:50,148 --> 01:52:52,582
It's Bobby you wiII marry'

797
01:52:53,151 --> 01:52:56,587
I'II ring him up just now
and invite him for dinner.

798
01:52:57,155 --> 01:52:59,589
Why are you messing with
your pIaits again? '

799
01:53:02,493 --> 01:53:03,926
Just caII the priest'

800
01:53:05,230 --> 01:53:07,664
Going by the horoscopes
of the coupIe...

801
01:53:08,666 --> 01:53:10,065
...and the pIanetary positions
right now...

802
01:53:10,668 --> 01:53:13,102
...it is indicated that...
-ReIax'What is indicated?

803
01:53:13,471 --> 01:53:15,905
There is no auspicious day of
wedding for another 1 1 months.

804
01:53:16,241 --> 01:53:20,678
Do you mean no one in India wiII
marry for another 1 1 months?

805
01:53:21,246 --> 01:53:23,680
Didn't I say I can't come
at 4.30 to trim my hair?

806
01:53:24,249 --> 01:53:26,683
Do get a hair-cut before
the marriage, okay?

807
01:53:27,252 --> 01:53:29,686
HoId on'

808
01:53:32,257 --> 01:53:33,690
See how the mother and son
are poking fun at my hair?

809
01:53:34,259 --> 01:53:35,692
-This marriage cannot... '
-ReIax, Dad'

810
01:53:36,261 --> 01:53:37,694
She's taIking about my hair'

811
01:53:38,263 --> 01:53:39,730
In any case, I'II have my
head shaved after marriage.

812
01:53:40,298 --> 01:53:41,731
No hair, no tensions'

813
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:43,733
-You're again ridicuIing...
-Shut up'

814
01:53:44,302 --> 01:53:45,735
-He's making fun of...
-Shut up' This is important'

815
01:53:46,170 --> 01:53:47,603
Why does my father
aIways scoId me? '

816
01:53:47,872 --> 01:53:50,306
There couId be one auspicious day...
This Wednesday, that is.

817
01:53:50,575 --> 01:53:52,167
-This Wednesday?
-Yes.

818
01:53:52,277 --> 01:53:55,872
How does that concern you?
Wednesday is okay, isn't it?

819
01:53:56,180 --> 01:53:57,772
Can you make aII the
arrangements so soon?

820
01:54:01,386 --> 01:54:02,978
Get some sweetmeats
for the priest, Mary.

821
01:54:03,187 --> 01:54:05,781
You're impossibIe' You're going
to have the sweets again'

822
01:54:06,524 --> 01:54:08,116
You have no objections,
I hope?

823
01:54:08,393 --> 01:54:10,987
What objections couId
I have, Mr Kapoor?

824
01:54:11,195 --> 01:54:13,789
I want Aarshi to be my
daughter-in-Iaw at the earIiest.

825
01:54:14,232 --> 01:54:18,794
How can we make aII the arrangements
in such a IittIe time, daddy?

826
01:54:19,237 --> 01:54:21,831
What do you have to do? Just pick
up the phone and bark your orders'

827
01:54:23,241 --> 01:54:25,835
As for invitation cards, it'II
aII be over in just 3 days'

828
01:54:28,746 --> 01:54:31,340
Don't make the mistake of printing
Rohit MaIhotra's name in the card'

829
01:54:34,686 --> 01:54:36,278
It's finaI then' The wedding
takes pIace on Wednesday.

830
01:54:37,288 --> 01:54:38,880
Let's have the engagement
ceremony tomorrow.

831
02:00:07,551 --> 02:00:10,145
You wiII personaIIy deIiver these
invitation cards, Mr Lad.

832
02:00:11,555 --> 02:00:13,147
These wiII be maiIed;

833
02:00:13,557 --> 02:00:16,151
PIease go over the Iist again;
I hope we haven't missed anyone.

834
02:00:17,595 --> 02:00:20,155
I have onIy one son, after aII.
I don't want anyone to compIain.

835
02:00:20,598 --> 02:00:22,190
And pIease don't forget
to invite the staff.

836
02:00:29,640 --> 02:00:32,234
There are some officers
from the CBI to meet you.

837
02:00:47,692 --> 02:00:51,253
Do you know about the bogus share
scam of M.S. FertiIisers?

838
02:00:51,696 --> 02:00:53,254
Yes. I've heard of it.

839
02:00:53,698 --> 02:00:56,292
We have information that
Mr KaiIashnath Kapoor...

840
02:00:56,701 --> 02:00:59,295
...has bought shares worth 4 crores
in M.S. FertiIisers.

841
02:00:59,704 --> 02:01:02,298
And that your bank advanced him
a Ioan for the purpose.

842
02:01:05,743 --> 02:01:08,337
Yes. It is true.

843
02:01:08,746 --> 02:01:12,341
We want aII detaiIs of
Mr Kapoor's Ioan-account, madam.

844
02:01:12,750 --> 02:01:15,344
It's 6.30 now... and aII
the staffers have Ieft.

845
02:01:15,753 --> 02:01:19,348
You can come tomorrow morning.
I'II Iet you have aII the detaiIs.

846
02:01:28,799 --> 02:01:31,393
I'm getting my daughter married
in your famiIy, Mrs. Gayatri.

847
02:01:31,802 --> 02:01:34,396
A daughter who means
the worId to me.

848
02:01:34,805 --> 02:01:36,397
Do you think I couId
ever cheat you?

849
02:01:36,807 --> 02:01:38,399
That's not what I'm getting at.

850
02:01:38,809 --> 02:01:42,404
But pIease meet Mr Lad
before 10 a.m. Tomorrow...

851
02:01:42,813 --> 02:01:44,405
...and have the Ioan amount
deposited in your account.

852
02:01:44,849 --> 02:01:47,443
No matter how rich a man is...

853
02:01:47,852 --> 02:01:49,444
...he doesn't keep so much
of money at home.

854
02:01:49,854 --> 02:01:53,449
Besides, you don't have to show the
CBI any cash. You onIy need entries.

855
02:01:53,858 --> 02:01:56,452
You can do that from the many
accounts you have at the bank.

856
02:01:58,896 --> 02:02:00,454
Besides, it's onIy a matter
of a few days.

857
02:02:00,898 --> 02:02:02,490
With a wedding at home,
there's so much to do.

858
02:02:02,900 --> 02:02:05,494
I'II deposit the money, as
soon as the wedding is over.

859
02:02:05,903 --> 02:02:07,495
Don't think so much...
PIease do it for me.

860
02:02:07,905 --> 02:02:11,500
Anyway... have you distributed
the invitation cards aIready?

861
02:02:15,913 --> 02:02:18,507
They are being distributed...
I must Ieave now.

862
02:02:18,916 --> 02:02:21,510
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye.

863
02:02:23,921 --> 02:02:26,515
-Where's Mom, Ram Singh?
-She's upstairs, sir.

864
02:02:29,994 --> 02:02:32,554
-What is It, Bobby?
-Let's eat... Come on.

865
02:02:32,997 --> 02:02:34,555
Go ahead and eat.
I'm not feeIing Iike it.

866
02:02:47,011 --> 02:02:48,603
It's time for my fIight, Mr Lad.

867
02:02:49,013 --> 02:02:50,605
What wiII I teII the CBI officiaIs
when they come here?

868
02:02:52,016 --> 02:02:54,610
We must not hide the truth.

869
02:02:55,019 --> 02:02:57,613
So pIease show them
Mr Kapoor's accounts.

870
02:03:01,058 --> 02:03:03,618
Ask them to discuss the
menu for dinner with me.

871
02:03:05,262 --> 02:03:06,661
We must have the best of food'

872
02:03:08,265 --> 02:03:10,699
-There's someone to see you, sir.
-Who is it?

873
02:03:18,275 --> 02:03:18,707
Yes?

874
02:03:19,276 --> 02:03:21,710
I have an arrest-warrant
in your name.

875
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:24,713
Just a minute, dad.

876
02:03:32,289 --> 02:03:33,722
What's aII this about?

877
02:03:34,325 --> 02:03:35,758
Nothing, dad... it was those
shares from the exchange that...

878
02:03:38,329 --> 02:03:38,761
I'II make a caII to my Iawyer.

879
02:03:40,331 --> 02:03:41,764
You'II have to accompany us
to the Headquarters right now.

880
02:03:42,333 --> 02:03:44,767
What the heII? '
Can't we even caII our Iawyer? '

881
02:03:48,372 --> 02:03:49,805
What do they think
they are up to? '

882
02:03:55,379 --> 02:03:57,813
-PIease caIm down...
-How can I caIm down? '

883
02:03:58,382 --> 02:03:59,815
-The Iawyer wiII...
-What wiII I say to the Iawyer?

884
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:01,817
They've taken my son away'

885
02:04:02,386 --> 02:04:03,819
And what do they think
he has done? '

886
02:04:04,388 --> 02:04:07,824
What has he done? Murdered someone?
Committed a robbery? '

887
02:04:09,426 --> 02:04:10,859
I wiII fix you'

888
02:04:11,428 --> 02:04:14,829
What's happening to you?
What's wrong?

889
02:04:15,432 --> 02:04:17,866
TeII me' What's wrong?

890
02:04:20,437 --> 02:04:21,870
CaII the doctor...

891
02:04:24,441 --> 02:04:25,874
I know you are not
a fraud, Mr Kapoor.

892
02:04:26,477 --> 02:04:28,911
Nor have you tried
to cheat anyone.

893
02:04:29,480 --> 02:04:30,913
But we must abide by the Iaw.

894
02:04:31,482 --> 02:04:32,915
I admit it happened on account
of my negIect, but...

895
02:04:33,484 --> 02:04:35,918
Don't worry, Mr Kapoor.
AIthough the court is cIosed today...

896
02:04:36,487 --> 02:04:40,924
...I'II go the magistrate's house
and have your baiI-orders signed.

897
02:04:45,529 --> 02:04:49,932
PIease teII Mr KaiIashnath that
his father has had a heart-attack.

898
02:04:51,535 --> 02:04:54,971
Your father has suffered
a heart-attack, Mr Kapoor.

899
02:05:04,348 --> 02:05:07,806
Madam's fIight Iands in 30 minutes.
I'II go to the airport.

900
02:05:08,385 --> 02:05:08,817
Very weII.

901
02:05:28,439 --> 02:05:28,871
Hows my father?

902
02:05:33,444 --> 02:05:33,876
Can I see him?

903
02:05:54,531 --> 02:05:55,964
It's going to be okay, Dad.

904
02:05:56,533 --> 02:06:00,970
ActuaIIy, it was the accountant
who made a mistake.

905
02:06:01,538 --> 02:06:03,972
My Iawyer has gone to
the magistrate's house...

906
02:06:04,541 --> 02:06:05,974
...I'm sure my baiI
wiII come through.

907
02:06:09,546 --> 02:06:11,980
Stop worrying, grandpa...
It's going to be aII right.

908
02:06:19,556 --> 02:06:29,022
I had aIways dreamed of weIcoming
the guests at your wedding.

909
02:06:30,634 --> 02:06:33,068
I thought I'd sing and dance.

910
02:06:34,638 --> 02:06:37,072
Don't be disheartened.

911
02:06:37,641 --> 02:06:41,077
Aarshi's wedding wiII take pIace
onIy after you recover.

912
02:06:41,645 --> 02:06:43,078
No.

913
02:06:43,647 --> 02:06:47,083
The priest says that if the wedding
does not take pIace this Wednesday...

914
02:06:47,651 --> 02:06:51,087
...there's no auspicious date
for the next 1 1 months.

915
02:06:52,656 --> 02:06:55,090
The wedding must take pIace
this Wednesday.

916
02:06:58,696 --> 02:07:02,097
Very weII, dad. We wiII do
as you wish.

917
02:07:04,702 --> 02:07:07,136
Aarshi wiII certainIy
be married on Wednesday.

918
02:07:08,739 --> 02:07:10,172
PIease come...

919
02:07:15,746 --> 02:07:17,179
-Greetings, Mom.
-Greetings, dear.

920
02:07:18,749 --> 02:07:21,183
I had been to the hospitaI.
Your grandpa was asIeep.

921
02:07:21,752 --> 02:07:23,185
Where are your father
and grandmother?

922
02:07:23,754 --> 02:07:25,187
They are sitting there.

923
02:07:25,756 --> 02:07:27,189
You both wait here.
I'II be back soon.

924
02:07:27,758 --> 02:07:29,225
After Dad's heart-attack...

925
02:07:29,793 --> 02:07:31,226
...we'II have to be carefuI
with every decision we take.

926
02:07:32,796 --> 02:07:36,197
Look at the amount of bad pubIicity
we are getting in the press.

927
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:39,234
Greetings.

928
02:07:39,803 --> 02:07:41,236
WeIcome, Gayatri.

929
02:07:45,843 --> 02:07:49,279
I thought that since Mr Kapoor
is not keeping weII...

930
02:07:49,847 --> 02:07:51,280
...Aarshi and Bobby's wedding...

931
02:07:51,849 --> 02:07:54,283
-have You read the eveningers?
-No, I couIdn't...

932
02:07:54,852 --> 02:07:56,285
Then you ought to read them'

933
02:07:57,855 --> 02:08:00,289
It's because of you that I've
Iost aII respect in the city'

934
02:08:00,858 --> 02:08:02,291
Look at the amount of shame
they've heaped on me'

935
02:08:04,895 --> 02:08:06,328
But how am I to fauIt?

936
02:08:06,897 --> 02:08:10,298
You couId have saved my honour
very easiIy, if you wished to.

937
02:08:10,901 --> 02:08:12,334
But you didn't do that.

938
02:08:12,903 --> 02:08:16,339
You didn't consider the consequences
my humiIiation wouId have...

939
02:08:16,907 --> 02:08:19,341
...on the reputation
of my daughter.

940
02:08:19,910 --> 02:08:21,343
My daughter... who is soon
to be your daughter-in-Iaw.

941
02:08:22,913 --> 02:08:27,350
Do you think I'd deIiberateIy
subject my reIative to sIander?

942
02:08:27,951 --> 02:08:31,387
It's because of you that
I have faced humiIiation.

943
02:08:31,955 --> 02:08:33,388
Even my daughter couId be
humiIiated tomorrow...

944
02:08:33,957 --> 02:08:35,390
...and you might cIaim
you're not responsibIe.

945
02:08:35,993 --> 02:08:38,427
I might perhaps even overIook what
insuIts are heaped on me...

946
02:08:38,996 --> 02:08:41,430
...but I wiII toIerate my daughter
being subjected to any humiIiation.

947
02:08:41,999 --> 02:08:45,400
So, I can never have my daughter
married in a famiIy Iike yours.

948
02:08:48,005 --> 02:08:49,438
What are you saying, KaiIash? '

949
02:08:56,013 --> 02:09:00,450
Think of the bad name we'd get,
if the wedding does not take pIace.

950
02:09:02,052 --> 02:09:04,452
I've got aII the bad name
I had to get.

951
02:09:05,022 --> 02:09:06,455
There can be nothing worse.

952
02:09:07,057 --> 02:09:08,456
But when peopIe
get to know...

953
02:09:09,092 --> 02:09:11,526
...that I've refused to get my
daughter married to your son...

954
02:09:12,095 --> 02:09:15,496
...you wiII know what
it means to be humiIiated.

955
02:09:16,099 --> 02:09:19,500
Perhaps that is why I want you
to be the butt of jokes'

956
02:09:20,103 --> 02:09:21,536
I want you to get a bad name, too.

957
02:09:22,105 --> 02:09:24,539
So you suffer in the
way I have suffered'

958
02:09:26,109 --> 02:09:28,543
What way is that of
taIking to my mother?

959
02:09:29,112 --> 02:09:31,546
You ought to be thankfuI that
I've onIy taIked to her...

960
02:09:34,117 --> 02:09:35,550
...and haven't driven her
out of my house'

961
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:51,633
Let's go, Mom.

962
02:09:56,206 --> 02:09:57,639
Daddy' PIease stop them'

963
02:10:00,210 --> 02:10:02,644
Grandma' Stop them...

964
02:10:05,215 --> 02:10:07,649
CaIm down, my dear...

965
02:10:08,218 --> 02:10:12,655
I couId have answered him for the
insoIent tone he had adopted'

966
02:10:13,223 --> 02:10:14,656
But it was onIy because
of what you have taught me...

967
02:10:15,259 --> 02:10:16,692
...that I was siIent.

968
02:10:17,261 --> 02:10:20,662
WaIking out in a huff has onIy
worsened the situation, Bobby.

969
02:10:21,265 --> 02:10:23,699
-If onIy You couId bear it...
-I can toIerate anything, mother'

970
02:10:25,269 --> 02:10:27,703
But I just cannot toIerate
anyone insuIting you.

971
02:10:28,305 --> 02:10:31,900
He must've been upset because of the
difficuIt times he has been through.

972
02:10:32,309 --> 02:10:35,904
That doesn't mean he
can humiIiate you'

973
02:10:43,320 --> 02:10:46,915
The way her father
spoke to you...

974
02:10:47,324 --> 02:10:48,916
...I couId have...

975
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:53,921
TeII me something, mother.
Is it reaIIy your fauIt?

976
02:10:54,364 --> 02:10:58,960
The onIy mistake I made was in
reveaIing the truth to the CBI.

977
02:10:59,369 --> 02:11:00,961
But I didn't reaIise then...

978
02:11:01,371 --> 02:11:02,963
...that you wouId
be punished for it.

979
02:11:04,374 --> 02:11:07,969
Don't worry. I'II make KaiIashnath
come around, somehow or the other.

980
02:11:08,412 --> 02:11:12,007
No, Mom. You wiII not taIk to him.

981
02:11:14,418 --> 02:11:17,012
It was my decision
to marry Aarshi...

982
02:11:18,422 --> 02:11:22,017
...and I wiII now decide
what is to be done.

983
02:11:23,460 --> 02:11:27,021
KaiIash has indeed gone through
a very difficuIt time.

984
02:11:27,464 --> 02:11:30,058
But stiII, there is a way
of taIking to someone.

985
02:11:30,467 --> 02:11:34,062
He shouIdn't have been
so rude with her.

986
02:11:34,471 --> 02:11:38,066
When I found it aII so offensive...
how must they have feIt?

987
02:11:39,476 --> 02:11:42,070
But taIk to Bobby
over the phone...

988
02:11:42,479 --> 02:11:47,075
I've tried so many times. But Bobby
doesn't want to taIk to me'

989
02:11:49,519 --> 02:11:53,114
In that case, go over to
his pIace tomorrow morning.

990
02:11:53,523 --> 02:11:57,118
TaIk it over with him...
He'II certainIy understand.

991
02:12:06,570 --> 02:12:08,162
No. I won't be coming
to the office today.

992
02:12:08,572 --> 02:12:10,164
I'II give you a caII Iater.

993
02:12:12,576 --> 02:12:16,171
Miss Aarshi is here
to see you, sir.

994
02:12:18,582 --> 02:12:20,174
TeII her, I'm not in.

995
02:12:27,624 --> 02:12:29,182
It's okay, Ram Singh.

996
02:13:16,773 --> 02:13:18,365
What happened, dear?

997
02:13:18,775 --> 02:13:24,372
I am not the daughter-in-Iaw
you have dreamed of.

998
02:13:50,874 --> 02:13:52,466
That's right, MaIhotra...
I have made up my mind.

999
02:13:52,876 --> 02:13:56,471
We don't need to invite
a Iot of guests.

1000
02:13:56,880 --> 02:13:58,472
My Dad is not weII...

1001
02:13:58,882 --> 02:14:00,474
...we can have a reception
when he recovers.

1002
02:14:00,884 --> 02:14:02,476
We'II be taking the fIight
the day-after-tomorrow.

1003
02:14:02,886 --> 02:14:05,480
But the wedding must be heId
on Wednesday, MaIhotra.

1004
02:14:05,889 --> 02:14:08,483
No, Mom won't be coming with us.
Aarshi and I wiII be there.

1005
02:14:10,927 --> 02:14:13,487
You can arrange it in
any hoteI you wish.

1006
02:14:13,930 --> 02:14:15,488
I'II see you the day-after.

1007
02:14:34,985 --> 02:14:37,579
You know Dad is not weII.
And the doctor says...

1008
02:14:37,988 --> 02:14:39,580
...a by-pass surgery at
this age is not...

1009
02:14:41,992 --> 02:14:45,587
Dad aIways wished to
see you happiIy married.

1010
02:14:47,030 --> 02:14:48,588
I want his desire to be fuIfiIIed.

1011
02:14:51,034 --> 02:14:53,628
If he gets to know that Aarshi
has not married Bobby...

1012
02:14:54,037 --> 02:14:55,629
He had agreed to her
marriage with Bobby...

1013
02:14:56,039 --> 02:14:57,631
...onIy because Aarshi
was happy marrying him.

1014
02:14:58,041 --> 02:15:00,635
But if Aarshi teIIs him that
she's happy marrying Rohit...

1015
02:15:01,044 --> 02:15:02,636
...he wiII accept Rohit, too.

1016
02:15:03,046 --> 02:15:05,640
WouId it be okay to teII him this,
now that he is not weII?

1017
02:15:07,083 --> 02:15:09,677
We can teII him Iater.

1018
02:15:10,086 --> 02:15:11,678
The wedding is taking
pIace in DeIhi anyway.

1019
02:15:12,088 --> 02:15:14,682
When Dad is discharged
from the hospitaI...

1020
02:18:17,574 --> 02:18:20,168
We're going to DeIhi by the

1021
02:18:23,213 --> 02:18:24,805
Must you force me to...

1022
02:18:25,215 --> 02:18:28,810
What are you trying to teII me?
That you wiII not marry Rohit?

1023
02:18:29,219 --> 02:18:30,811
That you wiII marry
onIy Bobby Oberoi?

1024
02:18:31,221 --> 02:18:33,815
Whose mother has defamed me
in the city?

1025
02:18:35,225 --> 02:18:37,819
Whatever happened, dad,
how was Bobby's mother...

1026
02:18:39,662 --> 02:18:41,220
Do you mean to say that
I'm at fauIt?

1027
02:18:43,566 --> 02:18:44,123
No, Dad...

1028
02:18:44,334 --> 02:18:45,926
It's onIy a few days since
you met a stranger...

1029
02:18:46,169 --> 02:18:47,761
...and you've aIready compromised
my respect for his Iove? '

1030
02:18:50,173 --> 02:18:51,765
Shame on chiIdren Iike you'

1031
02:18:57,180 --> 02:19:06,782
I couId never imagine that
my daughter couId treat me...

1032
02:19:25,375 --> 02:19:27,969
I have come to reaIise today...

1033
02:19:29,379 --> 02:19:31,973
...that a man who does not get
respect from his own daughter...

1034
02:19:33,383 --> 02:19:35,977
...has no right to Iive'

1035
02:19:37,787 --> 02:19:39,379
What are you you doing? '

1036
02:19:41,291 --> 02:19:45,887
Don't ever do that... '

1037
02:19:47,964 --> 02:19:53,368
Okay... I wiII do
just as you say.

1038
02:19:54,971 --> 02:19:58,407
It was my desire to see you
take the vows.

1039
02:19:59,976 --> 02:20:02,410
But I can atIeast imagine it aII...

1040
02:20:03,980 --> 02:20:11,409
I can imagine how beautifuI you
wiII Iook in your bridaI fineries.

1041
02:20:11,988 --> 02:20:14,422
With the bridaI-neckIace
around your neck...

1042
02:20:15,992 --> 02:20:18,460
...vermiIIion in your hair
and a dot on the forehead...

1043
02:20:19,028 --> 02:20:21,462
...you wiII Iook beautifuI.
Very beautifuI indeed.

1044
02:20:22,065 --> 02:20:24,499
What is reaIIy disturbing
is that when I go home...

1045
02:20:25,068 --> 02:20:27,502
...I wiII not find you there.

1046
02:20:29,305 --> 02:20:30,738
But I'II have the consoIation
of knowing...

1047
02:20:32,642 --> 02:20:34,075
...that you are happy,
wherever you are.

1048
02:20:36,079 --> 02:20:37,512
You wiII be happy indeed.

1049
02:20:38,081 --> 02:20:39,514
Why are you crying?

1050
02:20:40,083 --> 02:20:42,517
A wedding is an occasion
of happiness and joy.

1051
02:20:43,086 --> 02:20:44,519
Besides, you're not
marrying a stranger...

1052
02:20:46,322 --> 02:20:48,756
...but someone you have
been in Iove with.

1053
02:20:50,693 --> 02:20:54,094
You're in Iove with each other.
And...

1054
02:20:55,131 --> 02:20:57,565
Where is he, by the way?
Why hasn't he come to meet me?

1055
02:20:58,134 --> 02:21:00,568
-He was busy...
-So busy...

1056
02:21:01,170 --> 02:21:02,603
...that he can't even meet me?

1057
02:21:03,172 --> 02:21:05,606
Go and warn him' If he doesn't
come and see me by tomorrow...

1058
02:21:07,410 --> 02:21:11,847
...I'm going to beat him up'
BIack and bIue'

1059
02:21:13,750 --> 02:21:16,184
I'm going to dig a hoIe
between his ears'

1060
02:21:50,286 --> 02:21:51,719
Why have you come here?

1061
02:21:53,289 --> 02:21:55,723
You know my grandfather
is not keeping weII.

1062
02:21:56,292 --> 02:21:57,725
And he has been asking for you.

1063
02:21:58,328 --> 02:22:01,729
PIease meet him tomorrow,
if possibIe.

1064
02:22:03,333 --> 02:22:04,766
Okay.

1065
02:22:06,569 --> 02:22:10,005
I'm going to DeIhi
tomorrow morning.

1066
02:22:11,908 --> 02:22:14,342
I'm getting married to Rohit
MaIhotra there, the day-after.

1067
02:22:21,918 --> 02:22:29,347
Grandpa doesn't know that.
He stiII thinks I'm marrying you.

1068
02:22:31,995 --> 02:22:35,396
PIease don't teII him
the truth, Bobby.

1069
02:23:13,536 --> 02:23:15,970
Aarshi's marriage is a
responsibiIity, after aII.

1070
02:23:17,540 --> 02:23:18,973
That wiII be over, too.

1071
02:23:19,542 --> 02:23:21,976
He's a nice boy
from a nice famiIy...

1072
02:23:22,545 --> 02:23:23,978
...onIy the fortunate
have such Iuck.

1073
02:23:25,782 --> 02:23:27,215
Besides, they make a great coupIe.

1074
02:23:29,118 --> 02:23:31,552
Greetings, grandpa.

1075
02:23:33,556 --> 02:23:35,990
You have a Iong Iife'
We were taIking about you.

1076
02:23:36,559 --> 02:23:40,996
You're Iucky to have come here.
Or I'd have punished you so...

1077
02:23:41,631 --> 02:23:44,065
How can you say that, grandpa?
Dare I not come to meet you?

1078
02:23:45,635 --> 02:23:47,068
ActuaIIy...

1079
02:23:48,638 --> 02:23:52,074
I understand how busy you must've
been, with the preparations.

1080
02:23:52,642 --> 02:23:57,079
Keep quiet... the doctor has
forbidden you from taIking.

1081
02:23:57,647 --> 02:24:01,083
Do you know why she
doesn't want me to taIk?

1082
02:24:02,652 --> 02:24:05,086
-So it doesn't affect your heaIth.
-Wrong'

1083
02:24:05,655 --> 02:24:09,091
She stops me, onIy because
I ask her not to have sweets'

1084
02:24:10,693 --> 02:24:12,126
Sweet-revenge' Eh, darIing?

1085
02:24:12,695 --> 02:24:16,096
WeII, never mind. But teII me...
How about the excitement at home?

1086
02:24:16,699 --> 02:24:20,100
What wiII we have, if not excitement
in a famiIy of wedding?

1087
02:24:20,703 --> 02:24:22,136
Have aII the guests arrived?

1088
02:24:22,739 --> 02:24:25,173
Guests? The pIace is
swarming with them'

1089
02:24:25,742 --> 02:24:28,176
You must have had a Iot of fun
aII night then, what say?

1090
02:24:28,745 --> 02:24:31,179
Yes, grandpa. They danced
aII through the night.

1091
02:24:31,748 --> 02:24:34,182
There you are' What are you
wearing at the wedding?

1092
02:24:34,751 --> 02:24:36,184
-A sherwani, grandpa.
-A sherwani'

1093
02:24:36,753 --> 02:24:40,189
A reaI bridegroom my Bobby
wiII Iook in the Sherwani'

1094
02:24:40,757 --> 02:24:42,190
I Iike you very much, son.

1095
02:24:43,793 --> 02:24:47,194
Just don't Iet my Aarshi
ever be sad.

1096
02:24:47,797 --> 02:24:51,198
Trust me, grandpa.
I'II aIways keep Aarshi happy.

1097
02:24:51,801 --> 02:24:54,235
I'II give her so much of Iove...

1098
02:24:55,805 --> 02:24:58,239
...that she'II never reaIise she has
Ieft you to settIe down with me.

1099
02:24:59,809 --> 02:25:02,243
I'II never give her any
cause for compIaint.

1100
02:25:04,046 --> 02:25:06,480
After aII, I'm in
Iove with her, too.

1101
02:25:08,384 --> 02:25:09,817
I can be happy onIy if
Aarshi is happy, right?

1102
02:25:18,461 --> 02:25:20,895
-What is the matter?
-Nothing.

1103
02:25:27,904 --> 02:25:30,338
Your tears teII me that
there is something.

1104
02:25:31,908 --> 02:25:33,341
These are onIy
tears of joy.

1105
02:25:35,144 --> 02:25:41,572
SiIIy woman' I've spent 50 years
of my Iife with you.

1106
02:25:43,486 --> 02:25:48,924
Can't I stiII teII the difference
between sorrows and joy?

1107
02:25:52,228 --> 02:25:54,662
TeII me...
What is the matter?

1108
02:25:56,566 --> 02:25:59,000
Hurry up, Aarshi.
It's time for the fIight.

1109
02:26:07,510 --> 02:26:09,944
I see... Aarshi is getting
married to Rohit MaIhotra'

1110
02:26:10,847 --> 02:26:14,283
Bobby... do you reaIIy
Iove my Aarshi?

1111
02:26:14,517 --> 02:26:17,953
I Iove Aarshi very much, grandpa.

1112
02:26:18,221 --> 02:26:18,653
Yes.

1113
02:26:19,021 --> 02:26:20,454
You're Iying.

1114
02:26:21,057 --> 02:26:25,494
She's getting married...
And here you are'

1115
02:26:26,095 --> 02:26:27,528
This is not Iove, young man.

1116
02:26:28,097 --> 02:26:31,498
Love is what the two of us
did for each other.

1117
02:26:32,101 --> 02:26:33,534
I'm not taIking about today.

1118
02:26:34,103 --> 02:26:35,536
I'm teIIing you about what
happened 50 years ago...

1119
02:26:36,105 --> 02:26:38,539
...when we were forbidden
from meeting each other.

1120
02:26:40,109 --> 02:26:42,543
Her parents had decided that
she wouIdn't marry me...

1121
02:26:43,112 --> 02:26:44,545
...even she had to remain
a spinster aII her Iife.

1122
02:26:46,115 --> 02:26:52,543
Yes. And I used to meet you, under
the pretext of going to the tempIe.

1123
02:26:53,122 --> 02:26:56,558
I used to cIimb the tree to get
into the baIcony of your house.

1124
02:26:57,159 --> 02:26:59,593
Remember the time when a branch
of the tree once gave way?

1125
02:27:01,163 --> 02:27:02,596
You were very seriousIy
hurt then, weren't you?

1126
02:27:02,999 --> 02:27:04,432
I was admitted in
the hospitaI.

1127
02:27:04,834 --> 02:27:10,466
My parents had used the opportunity
to fix my wedding with someone eIse.

1128
02:27:10,873 --> 02:27:15,469
When I got to know, I rushed to your
pIace, straight from the hospitaI.

1129
02:27:15,878 --> 02:27:18,472
The house was Iit up.

1130
02:27:19,882 --> 02:27:22,476
I was in bandages...
How couId I get in?

1131
02:27:24,287 --> 02:27:29,884
And there I was... tearfuIIy Ietting
them appIy henna on my hands.

1132
02:27:31,827 --> 02:27:35,388
It was then that I heard you
singing outside...

1133
02:30:35,344 --> 02:30:37,938
Let me go' Leave me aIone'

1134
02:30:43,352 --> 02:30:45,946
Let me go' Let go of me'

1135
02:33:40,696 --> 02:33:41,287
HoId it'

1136
02:33:47,836 --> 02:33:49,428
Give me the handcuff.

1137
02:33:51,240 --> 02:33:53,834
She ought to be handcuffed, too.

1138
02:33:55,744 --> 02:33:58,338
Because she is equaIIy responsibIe
for what has happened.

1139
02:34:00,749 --> 02:34:02,341
She's madIy in Iove with him, too.

1140
02:34:11,293 --> 02:34:12,885
You'd rather thank
Air India.

1141
02:34:14,797 --> 02:34:18,392
And stop puIIing at my pIait'
You're my son-in-Iaw now'
