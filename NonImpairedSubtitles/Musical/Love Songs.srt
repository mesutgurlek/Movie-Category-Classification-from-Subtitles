1
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:14,679
In memory of Aude Monnin

2
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,749
Dedicated to Jean-Claude Guiguet

3
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:36,632
LOVE SONGS

4
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,744
Part One: The Departure

5
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,714
One for ''Pardonnez-moi'', please.

6
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,430
Excuse me, I was just after him.

7
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,734
It's me. I'm seeing a movie.

8
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,636
What are you seeing?

9
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,603
Seriously, what are you seeing?

10
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,175
I'm sick of movies alone.

11
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,516
Julie, I'll be offended
if you see that movie.

12
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,959
Do you love me or not?

13
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,359
That's a dumb question.

14
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,792
You're not alone. Is Alice there?

15
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,135
Not at all. No.

16
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,497
Ismael, I just thought of
something: you piss me off!

17
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,045
Caught you napping?

18
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,151
What?

19
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,685
Is it love or what?

20
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,689
You knock me out, Ismael.

21
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,986
You can read me like an open book.

22
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,856
I'll take back that question!

23
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,089
No, don't say anything, please.

24
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,423
Yes, I'm napping,

25
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,557
undeniably proving I'm in love.

26
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,568
Therefore, you deduce
I'm in love with you

27
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,833
and I resort to daydreams
to avoid expressing it...

28
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,941
I can't hear you clearly.

29
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,135
Get to work!
I want to go home.

30
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,176
- Julie yelled at you?
- Shut up!

31
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,473
- You scare me.
- Julie annoyed you?

32
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,106
Julie asked questions?

33
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,945
I know! She didn't disagree
when you moaned

34
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:16,453
you were the world's worst fuck?

35
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:19,423
I'll cut your tongue out.
It'll make life easier.

36
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,459
You'll thank me later, sweetie.

37
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,685
You're not even circumcised!

38
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:24,558
Why say that?

39
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,689
You're a mini-Jew, in fact.

40
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,768
Kiss my mini-Jew yarmulke
and get to work!

41
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,333
Excuse me, have you got a light?

42
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,590
Your barrage of questions

43
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,131
On the wherefore and why

44
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,631
Of my heart's reasons

45
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,566
Simply finds no reply

46
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,366
I can't deny

47
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,674
I have reasons to love you

48
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:14,008
I don't see why

49
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,078
The reasons why I love you

50
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:18,875
So the answer's no

51
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,653
Is it your pretty bum

52
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:27,089
Could it be fear of loneliness

53
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,625
Sheer luck or am I humdrum

54
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,458
Or is it just laziness

55
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,031
I can't deny

56
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,494
So tell me now

57
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,591
I have reasons to love you

58
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:37,863
I don't see why

59
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,972
I should let you know

60
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,900
The reasons why you love me so

61
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,510
So the answer's no

62
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,650
My angel sweet

63
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,586
Wants me to sing praises at her feet

64
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,689
Gloria

65
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,098
My holy dove

66
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,431
Demands to hear my song of love

67
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,532
Hallelujah

68
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,847
Is it your scent when you're near

69
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,418
The way you curl under the covers

70
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,819
Maybe it's even your sister dear

71
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,685
Your money or even worse

72
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,384
I can't deny

73
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,688
So tell me now

74
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,990
I have reasons to love you

75
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,454
One lost promise
Two careless words

76
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,955
Three pairs of panties
Left on the floor

77
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,525
Your lips are sour
Your smile sweet

78
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,653
Four pubes in the shower
I'm under your feet

79
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,287
Your mistakes

80
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,557
My professions

81
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,933
My curses

82
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,295
Your transgressions

83
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:20,497
And then?

84
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,739
After, you dream of before

85
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,578
Everything fades, it's an open book

86
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,340
Just tell me how we look

87
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,783
When we weigh up all we took

88
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,446
Just tell me how we look

89
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,550
Just tell me how we look

90
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,492
Five minutes flat
Not our best

91
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,069
Six pics if that
Of a sex or a breast

92
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,500
Seven calls from your mum
Every hour today

93
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,666
You should answer some
She won't go away

94
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,107
I'd make it better

95
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,342
If I could

96
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,439
Too much hurt

97
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,410
For the good

98
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,486
When you add it all up

99
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,819
Love, you love me how much

100
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,657
Everything fades, it's an open book

101
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,419
Just tell me how we look

102
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,862
When we weigh up all we took

103
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,490
Just tell me how we look

104
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,968
Just tell me how we look

105
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,536
Eight years of love
One Thursday

106
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,081
In my school pack
Your sole letter that day

107
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,615
Nine, will I make it
I can't lie

108
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,688
I know you're mine
But can love die

109
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,483
What memories

110
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,816
Do you have of me

111
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,488
Maybe we'd better

112
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,662
Leave it at that

113
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,095
Come on, tell me

114
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,470
We were too noisy?

115
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,118
It's Alice.

116
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,927
I've got my pyjamas.

117
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,988
Perfect Happiness

118
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,657
Voluptuous Pleasures

119
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,830
Politics

120
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,075
I'm not sure we're in the right order.

121
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,120
Excuse me, Ismael.

122
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,557
You agree, Julie?

123
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,397
Lights out?

124
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,703
Did I take my pill?

125
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,799
You took it.

126
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,071
Which one is it?

127
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,803
Diane 35. Did I take it?

128
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,711
- It suits you?
- Yes...

129
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,875
- The pill makes me depressed.
- It does?

130
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:53,713
You're on it?

131
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,845
I was but I've bought this thing,
it's like...

132
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,584
It's like a coil.
It replaces the pill, see.

133
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,887
- Why are you on the pill?
- It's not the pill!

134
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,996
Whatever.
You don't sleep with guys.

135
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,757
I'll check anyway.

136
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,629
What sex are you into?

137
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:08,825
Me? What sex?

138
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:12,665
I'm into non-sex, you know that.
That's the sex I'm into.

139
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:13,704
Thanks a lot!

140
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,103
You're different.

141
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:18,435
You're like my sister.
It's not really sex...

142
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,495
This is sick.

143
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:45,570
Why are people so against egoism?
Egoism can be moral.

144
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,138
That's really sick!

145
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,569
You should be guiding me.

146
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,544
We were supposed to sleep, remember.

147
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,947
I really think you're very pretty.

148
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:01,116
I'm not sure you really thinking that
reassures me.

149
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,887
You think you could?

150
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:07,121
What?

151
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,817
Tell me you love me a little.

152
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,055
Do you love me?

153
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,458
Are you in love with me?

154
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,865
No, I don't love you.

155
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,663
You don't love me?

156
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,500
Of course I love you!

157
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,740
Except that I...

158
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,066
Screw you!

159
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,766
That's pathetic.

160
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,607
It's pitiful.

161
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:33,848
By staying with you, am I supporting
something that sickens me?

162
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,978
This soppiness...

163
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,722
You started, with your non-sex.

164
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:42,123
Non-sex isn't an open door
to such idyllic romanticism!

165
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,989
I'm anything but romantic.

166
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,428
You're anything but what you say.

167
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,159
Anything but a boss, a Jew...

168
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:52,064
Give me a break!
I never laid claim to being Jewish.

169
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:56,037
I can't even locate Tel Aviv
on a map of Palestine!

170
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,706
You start with mad joy.

171
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,906
Concentrate.

172
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,022
Tranquillity.

173
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,589
Surprise.

174
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:19,720
And?

175
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,525
That's not surprise. What is it?

176
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,001
- What is it, Julie? Help us.
- No idea.

177
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,066
Amazement!

178
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,706
Sorrow.

179
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,812
Sorrow, far from moderate.

180
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,608
Despondency, Dad.

181
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,345
Yes, despondency.

182
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,621
Fear.

183
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,387
More than fear...

184
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:54,762
- Dread.
- No, watch.

185
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:55,799
Terror?

186
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,732
Not terror? What then?

187
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,767
It's horror.

188
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,702
Well done, Jasmine.

189
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,007
Despair?

190
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,783
In other words, I take him
from joy to despair.

191
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,084
Thanks a lot.

192
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,469
Ismael annoys you a little?

193
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,836
Yeah, he annoys me a lot.

194
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,776
Have you seen Cedric again?

195
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,113
I suppose you could say that.

196
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:49,048
He's married. He'll never leave her.
I know that.

197
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:52,088
Maybe when his kid
changes schools in two years.

198
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,790
Unless the idiot repeats a year.

199
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,921
What's going on, Julie?

200
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,735
We're involved in a dumb scene
and Ismael's useless.

201
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,439
So what else is new?

202
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,408
He's forcing me
to break up for him.

203
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,810
You're leaving him?

204
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,743
Not break up with him...

205
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,115
We've started this threesome and...

206
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,653
the third person's taking root.

207
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,456
Who is it?

208
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,756
It's a girl.

209
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,724
Alice.

210
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,796
Was that Ismael's idea?

211
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,500
No, it was mine.

212
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,135
I'm into threesomes.

213
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,429
Jeanne, let me help Julie.

214
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,402
To do what?

215
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,666
Let me, okay.

216
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,503
You're needed in there.

217
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,803
Go and sit down.

218
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,902
No arguing.
Don't let dad drink too much.

219
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,816
What's going on?

220
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,151
It's really complicated.

221
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,762
A threesome with Ismael?

222
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,792
Why didn't you tell me?

223
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:06,990
I don't know.

224
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,525
I didn't need to, I guess.

225
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,463
How long have you been three?

226
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,372
A few weeks.

227
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,670
A month.

228
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,306
A month?!

229
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,341
- I don't want to pry...
- So don't pry.

230
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,313
I'm surprised in any case.

231
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,116
So is this threesome over or not?

232
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,788
Nearly.

233
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,624
Does this Alice have your key?

234
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:34,750
Mum...

235
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,122
You were spying!

236
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,622
What's it like?

237
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,722
Sorry, I shouldn't ask that.

238
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,027
I don't mind.

239
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:43,796
So what's it like?

240
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,062
Weird, okay.

241
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,995
And it's hard to sleep.

242
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,475
All three of you sleep together?

243
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,938
And it's hard to sleep?

244
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,709
Yes, Alice has nightmares.

245
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,509
That can't be easy.

246
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,916
And she's in the middle...

247
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,913
We shouldn't talk about this.

248
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,723
I agree,
but we are talking about it.

249
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:08,917
I am quite intrigued.

250
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,518
Only natural, Mum.

251
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:14,757
I don't get it...

252
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,700
This Alice,
is she for Ismael or for you?

253
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,301
For both of us.

254
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,999
Both of you?

255
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,606
Not together?

256
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,004
Yes, sometimes.

257
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,739
But it's tricky.

258
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,337
It takes effort.

259
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,741
Yes, of course.
I can believe that.

260
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,516
Did it come naturally?

261
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,517
What? The sex?

262
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,856
Yes, the positions...

263
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,452
I...

264
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,656
Did you know
where to put yourself naturally?

265
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,594
That's the easy part.

266
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,294
How do you decide?

267
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,462
On what?

268
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,371
Well, do you talk about it first or...

269
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,712
No, not really. It just happens.

270
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,146
It's not embarrassing?

271
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:04,542
No, not at all.

272
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,517
I thought it'd be complicated.

273
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,921
It's tricky enough for two as it is.

274
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:19,693
- Had you done it with a girl before?
- Me? No.

275
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,892
Do you like it?

276
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,096
It's weird. It's...

277
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,098
It's funny. It's different.

278
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:28,765
But Alice likes it!

279
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:32,332
I'm not answering that.
We've talked enough.

280
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,571
Yes. Thank you, sweetheart.

281
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,308
It's good to confide
in your mum, baby.

282
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,942
The cake's going to burn!

283
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,683
I want you to know
I'm still in love with Ismael.

284
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,691
You do it to make him happy?

285
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,921
Bring the cups.

286
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,473
Ismael's doing his cushion thing.

287
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,440
Not so loud. He just dropped off.

288
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,512
The jerk does it well.

289
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:19,554
Let's go and see Jeanne now.
Let's see Auntie Jeanne.

290
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,821
Do a little burp for Auntie Jeanne.

291
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,929
Dirty bugger!

292
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,859
Are you crazy?

293
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,828
I loved that cushion!

294
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,425
I'll get it.

295
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:31,901
Cut the cake first.

296
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,697
You'll only say we cheated after.

297
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,806
Who's going to hide?

298
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,208
For God's sake, Dad!

299
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:43,873
My little sweetie-pie...
''Who's this piece for?''

300
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,709
That's not very funny, Dad.

301
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,375
She doesn't want to.

302
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,784
Come and give your dad a kiss.

303
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,820
Now close your eyes.

304
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,461
Who's this piece for?

305
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:00,896
For Mum.

306
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:03,623
Make room for me.

307
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:06,397
Give your old father a cuddle...

308
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,940
Move up a bit.

309
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,633
There's no room.

310
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:13,540
You too.

311
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,840
- Mum, take a photo.
- Not now...

312
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,812
This is so embarrassing.
I'll get the cushion.

313
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,412
Jealous...

314
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,916
I thought Ismael worked Sundays.

315
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,954
He still does. Every other Sunday.

316
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,224
Why are we doing the dishes?

317
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,458
The washer's dead.

318
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,729
I mean why are we cleaning up
for the men?

319
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,463
It pisses me off!

320
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,402
We ate too, Julie.

321
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,511
Doesn't Dad ever do a thing?

322
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:47,772
He's revising.

323
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,744
That degree's a joke, Mum!

324
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,475
He'll never sit the exams.

325
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,814
I'm not so sure.
He'll do it just to piss me off.

326
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:00,621
The rain falls without a care

327
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,891
On the angel of the Bastille Square

328
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:07,756
The sky is so grey up there

329
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,734
As the rain's needles pierce the air

330
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,369
The rain falls without a care

331
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:19,373
The grey clouds, heavy and solemn

332
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:22,811
Bring water for Paris so fair

333
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,184
For the naked angel on its column

334
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,946
Nothing moves on the street

335
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,780
Outside the window pane

336
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,685
Paris seems draped in a sheet

337
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,621
Bathed in drops of rain

338
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,283
Against the broken sky

339
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,453
The angel spreads its wings

340
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:38,893
I'd love you till goodbye

341
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:41,657
In this rain and all it brings

342
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,258
Shit!

343
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,564
I'll go.

344
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:59,874
Rain falls again without a care

345
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:03,248
On the angel of the Bastille Square

346
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:07,317
A pot of tea that we share

347
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,486
In the camomile Sunday air

348
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:14,259
The rain pours down without a care

349
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,796
Who'd have thought a drop of rain

350
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:21,702
Would make people flee the square

351
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:25,270
Leaving the angel to its disdain

352
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,208
Nothing moves on the street

353
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,939
Outside the window pane

354
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,774
Paris seems draped in a sheet

355
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,713
Bathed in drops of rain

356
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,581
Against the broken sky

357
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,586
The angel spreads its wings

358
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,417
I'd love you till goodbye

359
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,923
In this rain and all it brings

360
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:13,182
The rain still falls without a care

361
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,926
On the angel of the Bastille Square

362
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,524
An early night we both share

363
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,695
In sheets free of wear and tear

364
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:28,136
The rain falls without a care

365
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,934
Over family meals we have to bear

366
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:35,443
The angel in the floodlight's glare

367
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,945
Spreads its wings on the Bastille Square

368
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,234
You bought a new ring?

369
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,337
I gave it to her.

370
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,873
That's a serious breach of contract.

371
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,636
- What contract?
- The gentleman's one.

372
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,443
- No rings for my wife.
- I'm not your wife!

373
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,150
I know what you're up to.

374
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:17,215
You think
I can't figure out your plan?

375
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:21,117
You'll eliminate me by beguiling me

376
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,625
with your kisses...

377
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,319
What do you mean?

378
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,659
This is no three-ring circus.

379
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:28,829
With me as your horse?

380
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,464
A real gift-horse.

381
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,464
With your heart.

382
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:33,868
And your teeth.

383
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:35,570
You're sure?

384
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,403
Touching her means fucking me.

385
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,777
You're sick!

386
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,411
Send in the clowns...

387
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:50,919
I don't want to go.

388
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,919
We won't stay long.

389
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:57,222
Slowly...
Watch the cars.

390
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:58,453
Look out!

391
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:00,156
Thank you.

392
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,168
I know your game

393
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,273
You think you've won

394
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:19,142
Your cake and the baker's dame

395
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,543
Two for the price of one

396
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:24,254
Little bitch, that's so cheap

397
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,549
It makes a nasty sound

398
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,683
Your jealousy won't make me weep

399
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,926
After all, you sleep around

400
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,831
I'm the bridge between your banks

401
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,523
Running from side to side

402
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,198
Cross over and give me thanks

403
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,905
Kiss and let me be your guide

404
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,636
I love no one but you

405
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,283
I love no one but you

406
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,683
Little shit, you think you're so swell

407
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,851
I smelled your fingers, swine

408
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,855
Where did they get that odd smell

409
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,291
It's definitely not mine

410
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,287
Little bitch, go to hell

411
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,559
You're just as bad as me

412
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,658
In adultery you dwell

413
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,834
She touches you, I see

414
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,704
I'm the bridge between your banks

415
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,140
Running from side to side

416
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:22,106
Climb on top, I'll say thanks

417
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,440
Why not give me a ride

418
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,920
I love no one but you

419
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:37,659
Little shit, make your choice

420
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,753
We'll be two, no longer three

421
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,798
That's all over, let's rejoice

422
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,130
Come on, it's her or me

423
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,266
Little bitch, I'll make my choice

424
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,398
You know better than all of us

425
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,437
Let's hear your pretty voice

426
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:54,904
In this circus

427
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,615
I'm the bridge between your banks

428
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,844
Your quarrels leave me cold

429
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,844
Trample me and rub my flanks

430
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,484
I'll stay here and grow old

431
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,293
I love no one but you

432
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,159
Paris is already so far away

433
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,224
Paris so petty and petit

434
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,324
We'll be happy every day

435
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,866
Enveloped in the city

436
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:56,232
Who cares anyway

437
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:02,272
If it's raining at JFK

438
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:08,446
I'm scared during landing

439
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:11,147
But you hold my hand tight

440
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:14,225
Like a kid so understanding

441
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,654
I wept there in my plight

442
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,427
Who cares anyway

443
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:26,195
As long as with you I stay

444
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:32,269
Crossing from the Brooklyn side

445
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,435
Touch my hands.

446
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,845
My love so sweet and mild

447
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,217
I'll be right back.

448
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:44,186
Was laughing happily, wide-eyed

449
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,255
Like a happy child

450
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:56,862
April brings Manhattan

451
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,161
Sunshine and blue skies

452
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,138
Like an eternity in satin...

453
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,503
- His name's Gwendal.
- I don't care.

454
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,874
Who cares anyway

455
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,139
I'll get Julie.

456
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,582
If the wind carries your scarf away

457
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,815
As Broadway turns on the heat

458
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,760
We're dancing on the rooftop

459
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,888
Of 218 Adam Street

460
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,225
You're my Liza and I'm your Bob

461
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,358
Excuse me.

462
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:32,968
You're here?

463
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:35,870
I don't feel good.

464
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,344
I'm going home.

465
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:44,942
- Stay if you want.
- Are you crazy? Come on.

466
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,618
Let's go home.

467
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,279
Just a second.

468
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:00,489
Where did I put the damn stub?

469
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,265
Got it.

470
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:06,530
You fetch it. I'll go on up.

471
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:20,882
We can't go out.

472
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,819
- Stay inside.
- That's my girlfriend.

473
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:27,456
What's going on?

474
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,155
Julie. Stand back.

475
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:58,780
Good evening.

476
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,758
I called because a lady collapsed.
This is her boyfriend.

477
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,654
Good evening.

478
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,358
Good evening.

479
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,763
Julie. Julie Pommeraye.

480
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,671
P-O-double M

481
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,373
E-R-A-Y-E.

482
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,773
And your relationship to her?

483
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,402
I'm her boyfriend.

484
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,673
- And you are?
- Ismael.

485
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:26,910
Benoliel.

486
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:29,211
B-E-N-O

487
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,517
L-I-E-L.

488
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,584
Were you here when it happened?

489
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:42,162
A young woman, 28,
heart and respiratory arrest.

490
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,529
GCS 3.

491
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,426
I'm fitting the scope.

492
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:46,867
Hook up the drip.

493
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,370
The sat rate is 95 for now.

494
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:52,402
During the concert,

495
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,206
she felt faint,
she went to the bathroom.

496
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,309
I joined her.

497
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,379
I went to get our things.

498
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,475
When I joined her outside...

499
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:05,251
she was lying on the ground.

500
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,489
Did you consume alcohol?

501
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,121
Did you use drugs?

502
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,495
How long were you apart?

503
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,430
I don't know. Two minutes.

504
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:21,333
Would you mind
waiting in the car, please?

505
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,817
Take her shoulders.

506
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,459
Watch the gear.

507
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:54,463
When you're ready. Head to foot.

508
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,162
Shoulders ready.

509
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,935
Prepare to lift. Lift.

510
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:14,886
Prepare to lift.

511
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:16,360
Lift.

512
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:31,167
200 joules loaded. Step back.

513
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,272
Watch out for the charge.

514
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:34,441
Charge!

515
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,547
No pulse. No pulse at all.

516
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:43,848
She's in total AV block.
No reaction at all?

517
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:48,682
Forget the bicarb,
prep a shot of adrenalin. 20 mg.

518
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,852
Carry on ventilating.
Keep her on manual.

519
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,427
- Still no pulse.
- One more charge.

520
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,398
Prep another shot.

521
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:06,937
I'm the doctor.

522
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,486
TN 10, 10 Quebec Foxtrot.

523
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:27,855
Delta Oscar Sierra
for 59, rue du Chateau d'Eau.

524
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:02,495
My final tune just began

525
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,299
My last song along this road

526
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,738
A single for a single man

527
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:13,743
My terror summed up in a code

528
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:17,337
Delta Oscar Sierra

529
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,807
The police code like a breath

530
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,711
Delta Oscar Sierra

531
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,423
The song of approaching death

532
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:29,424
It's Ismael.

533
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,893
This song of mine's a real must

534
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,858
But you fall before it passes

535
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,463
It's all dust to dust

536
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:43,498
A mean little mound of ashes

537
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,938
Delta Oscar Sierra

538
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,707
The flashing of the ambulance

539
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:54,518
Delta Oscar Sierra

540
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:58,386
The song of death's dance

541
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:09,225
Your father says you're asleep

542
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,201
Your mother wants to touch your brow

543
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:17,199
The wood around you makes us weep

544
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:24,205
And tells us now that you're now...
Delta Oscar Sierra

545
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:27,683
You dance against the walls

546
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:31,750
Delta Oscar Sierra

547
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:35,458
As death calls
Do you need help?

548
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:38,755
Delta Oscar Sierra

549
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:42,088
The police code like a breath

550
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,565
Where did I put it?

551
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:44,726
My book...

552
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:50,372
The song of approaching death

553
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,944
Delta Oscar Sierra

554
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:57,273
The flashing of the ambulance

555
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,212
The Night Stirs

556
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:01,842
Many people have a soul
that loves to swim.

557
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,578
They are commonly known as lazy.''

558
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:50,165
Part Two: The Absence

559
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,936
Ismael.

560
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,738
Okay?

561
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:08,148
Going to my place?

562
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:09,378
Of course.

563
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,352
Why didn't you let me know?

564
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,252
I left a hundred messages.

565
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,415
I know but my phone is...

566
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,890
out of order.
I'm going to the paper.

567
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:21,121
I've taken half a day off work.
Let's do it now.

568
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,563
I can't!

569
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,460
Give me the keys. I'll do it.

570
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:28,061
The place is a mess.

571
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:30,572
- Put them in the mailbox.
- I won't snoop.

572
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,332
Of course you will.

573
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:36,311
The sandwich in the fridge...
Don't throw it out. Or eat it.

574
00:39:56,026 --> 00:40:00,963
First insert, Sarkozy's son's scooter.
Three suspects arrested...

575
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,396
Are you listening?

576
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,301
Arrested has an ''r'' missing,

577
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,392
third line.

578
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:09,371
DNA, there's an extra space.

579
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:12,465
Last line, after ''policeman'',
add an exclamation mark.

580
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:17,437
You're not the materialistic type,
are you?

581
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:18,537
No.

582
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,545
Clothes and stuff
don't really matter to you.

583
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:26,180
Is this some twisted way
to say I have no dress sense?

584
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:29,158
No, it's a ploy.

585
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:32,260
You won't see
stuff left at my place again.

586
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:35,093
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

587
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:38,933
Jeanne's gathering Julie's clothes
for a bonfire.

588
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:40,367
Shit, what a bummer!

589
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,132
I told you 20 times.

590
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,604
You confiscated my key.

591
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,334
But I spend all day there.

592
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:49,174
- Couldn't you sort my stuff?
- I open a closet, I break down.

593
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:53,950
- So sorting things...
- If only you could break down.

594
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:56,212
- Open the closets. Wide!
- Shut up...

595
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,652
I can help you.
You can help me too.

596
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,389
Leave me be.

597
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:05,723
I can see you're bothered
but I don't love Gwendal yet.

598
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,228
I don't love you either,
so calm down.

599
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:11,699
But I need you. You're surprised?

600
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,375
Be quiet

601
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:23,002
You've said so much
nothing surprises me now

602
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:27,275
We make

603
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:32,013
A silent promise, a speechless vow

604
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:37,159
The words

605
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:40,597
In excess

606
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:44,167
We must

607
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:47,328
Be quiet

608
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:52,068
Our tongues are weary, let them rest

609
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,236
To have

610
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,440
Tongue to tongue

611
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,744
A dialogue of the deaf

612
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:05,087
Sometimes

613
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:09,483
Believe me

614
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,019
We must

615
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,122
Be quiet

616
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:20,465
Keep your saliva as an antidote

617
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,031
Let it

618
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:29,442
Trickle like sweet venom down my throat

619
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:33,746
The words

620
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:38,345
In excess

621
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:41,648
We must

622
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:44,657
Be quiet

623
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:49,293
Our lips are dry
and our mouths don't need

624
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,734
To get

625
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:55,667
Caught up in the words

626
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:58,341
Of this play we read

627
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:03,273
Sometimes

628
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,209
Believe me

629
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,387
We must

630
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:14,116
Be quiet

631
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,287
At last

632
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:22,694
Be quiet

633
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,528
In the end...

634
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,644
It's my kid brother's.

635
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,748
- He's a clean guy.
- Not with the dishes!

636
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,509
For the remotes...

637
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,145
You have cable, TV and DVD.

638
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:47,280
There are earphones if you want.

639
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:49,723
For the PlayStation,
unplug the lead.

640
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,652
Thanks.

641
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,223
Good night.

642
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:14,108
It's you then?

643
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:14,980
What is?

644
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:16,347
The draught...

645
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:18,113
Sorry.

646
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:25,359
It's not a problem.

647
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,556
But since we haven't paid the gas bill,

648
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,329
we sleep with the window closed.

649
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,167
You don't like my sleeping bag?

650
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,199
It's fine, but I can't sleep
so I'm not using it.

651
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:42,502
Yeah, I know. I was told.

652
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:54,957
Whatever you were told,
I can be alone.

653
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,586
It's six o'clock.

654
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,560
Usually, I get up at seven.

655
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,959
I'll make us some coffee.

656
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:08,632
Why get up so early?

657
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:11,235
To go to school.

658
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:12,638
Shit...

659
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,441
The bastards.

660
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,206
It's too early for their crap.

661
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,546
My name's Erwann.

662
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:27,216
Shit, the bastards,
they're all Bretons.

663
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:28,990
You said it.

664
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:33,485
Shelves full of Anatole Le Braz,
crepes every Monday night

665
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:37,431
and our motto: ''Treat a sailor well
and he'll shit in your hand.''

666
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:38,899
Very nice...

667
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,128
Isn't it?

668
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,296
Unfortunately, the buds are out.

669
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:46,706
A lot of maples are opening out.
The Japanese roses are in flower...

670
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,208
A frost will kill them.

671
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,579
To avoid that, go out to the garden

672
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:55,243
and prune all these tiny branches...

673
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:58,116
Morning TV is bad
for your mental health.

674
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:03,354
Use my room.
It's the first on the left.

675
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:06,987
The sheets are clean.

676
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:10,197
Sleep well.

677
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,267
Thanks!

678
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,544
- Okay?
- My day's off to a good start.

679
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,877
How do you experience things
before 8 AM?

680
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:28,484
It'll be a glorious day.
Done your English?

681
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,512
No, but I've read Aragon.
''Le Cri du butor''.

682
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,453
Don't spoil it!

683
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,024
It will be a glorious day

684
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:38,390
Unnatural weather
Like a painterly sky

685
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:40,156
Weather strong as a woman

686
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:41,993
Weather to sell your soul

687
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,691
It will be a glorious day

688
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:45,664
Weather to laugh and run

689
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:48,337
Weather to stay alive
To fear the worst

690
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:50,269
Stop it! For pity's sake, stop!

691
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:53,969
On the banks of the Seine
Young people at midday

692
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:56,944
Michel with Madeleine
Pierre with Jeanne and Germaine

693
00:46:57,047 --> 00:46:58,378
Who walks with Jean

694
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,076
If the sky is full of birds
What do you care

695
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:03,278
The fire that burns in hell

696
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:06,083
Where are you going
The swallows ask

697
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,589
Is April here at last

698
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,357
Paparazzi!

699
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:48,462
You're the first guy
to sleep in my bed.

700
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:49,429
I am?

701
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,467
I got you some...

702
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:54,495
some... from the bakery.

703
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:57,232
Croissants?

704
00:47:57,341 --> 00:48:01,004
Not croissants, raisin buns.
They're better with tea.

705
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,476
- Tea? What time is it?
- 5:15 PM.

706
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:10,648
No time to stop off at home.
Is Alice here?

707
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:12,378
No, there's no one here.

708
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:17,191
- I can lend you clean clothes.
- Yes, please.

709
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:19,890
I smell a bit funky.

710
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:29,698
What?

711
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:30,931
Very Breton.

712
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:32,508
Give me a break.

713
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:42,181
Can you lock up?

714
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:44,179
- Good night.
- Good night, Yvette.

715
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:45,947
Good night, Alice.

716
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:55,658
You know, Alice...

717
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:58,926
Julie's parents
have had the autopsy results.

718
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:00,034
And?

719
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:02,697
It was cardiac arrest.

720
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:07,341
A small blood clot lodged itself
in an artery.

721
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:10,545
Nothing caused it.
It's like a cot death.

722
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,715
Let's have a drink.

723
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:16,612
I'm tired. I want to go home.

724
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:19,317
Okay, see you.

725
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,116
If you can't sleep, call me.

726
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,552
You will?

727
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:26,587
You promise?

728
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:28,494
Stop freaking me out.

729
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:08,595
- Hi!
- Shit, are you crazy?

730
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,735
You finish late.

731
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:13,298
Why are you here?

732
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,206
This is my neighbourhood too.

733
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:19,473
Posters for Communist Workers?

734
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:20,550
Exactly.

735
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,311
What do you want?

736
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,012
Nothing. I just came to say hi.

737
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:28,121
At three in the morning?

738
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:29,923
If I'm a pain, I'll go.

739
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,723
You're not a pain
but how did you find me?

740
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,991
I don't really know.

741
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,065
I'm going.

742
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:40,329
To your place? Can I come?

743
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:42,460
No.

744
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,005
Should I insist?

745
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:49,008
Wait at your office tomorrow?

746
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,046
I'm sorry, Erwann. No.

747
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:55,778
You have no doubts?

748
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:57,510
You don't need anyone?

749
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:00,649
Did I ask you anything?

750
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:05,492
Okay, I'm splitting.

751
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:30,679
Why are you here?

752
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:32,149
I was worried.

753
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:36,017
You didn't come home last night.

754
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:37,751
You're not my mother.

755
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:41,228
You could have called.
I left messages.

756
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:43,430
You spoke to my parents?

757
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,735
You heard about the autopsy?

758
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:52,067
- You slept here yesterday?
- Yes.

759
00:51:58,081 --> 00:51:59,480
Don't you have a home?

760
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,347
I thought we could help each other.

761
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,714
Support each other.

762
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:06,380
Together.

763
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:12,019
It's just as hard for me, Ismael.

764
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:15,024
You could make an effort.

765
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,694
An effort how?

766
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:19,565
Respect my sorrow.

767
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:23,469
- You respect me, moving in here?
- It was my sister's place too.

768
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,340
What's the dog doing here?

769
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:30,537
I was scared here alone
so Mum let me borrow her.

770
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:31,979
Got a light?

771
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:00,667
You got the issue finished?

772
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:05,709
Sorry, I can't go on like this.
I just can't.

773
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:08,282
I'm not interested.
It doesn't help.

774
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:10,012
Have Julie's keys.

775
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,520
I'll take mine and say good night.

776
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:33,137
No questions.
Give me the door code.

777
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,067
7 A20.

778
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:41,974
Make yourself at home.

779
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,356
You're working late, young man.

780
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:49,152
I'm not working.

781
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:53,052
What's a Breton library like?

782
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,390
The Beautiful Room Is Empty

783
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,730
This isn't on the programme.

784
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:02,631
Mad About Vincent

785
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:04,237
Don't mix them up.

786
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:07,567
Salinger though...

787
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:15,541
Have you ever loved

788
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:18,086
For the sheer sake of it

789
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:20,520
Have you ever taken

790
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:23,257
A bite of the apple

791
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,656
For the taste of the fruit

792
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,291
Its sweetness and its zest

793
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:30,931
Have you often lost your way

794
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:36,397
Yes, I've already loved

795
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:39,064
For the sheer sake of it

796
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:41,405
But the apple was hard

797
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:43,445
And I cracked a tooth

798
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:47,043
Those unripe passions

799
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,443
Those indigestible loves

800
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:52,214
Often made me feel sick

801
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:57,449
But a true love that lasts

802
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,051
Leaves lovers exhausted

803
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:02,461
And their overripe kisses

804
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:05,191
Rot on our tongues

805
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,634
But fleeting love affairs

806
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:10,302
Know such futile fevers

807
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,941
And their kisses so green

808
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,373
Chafe against our lips

809
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:18,046
For if you wish to love

810
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:20,246
For the sheer sake of it

811
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:23,451
The worm in the apple

812
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:25,316
Can slip between our teeth

813
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:28,554
It eats away at our heart

814
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:31,393
Our brain and all the rest

815
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,156
Slowly bleeding us dry

816
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:39,124
But when we dare to love

817
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,930
For the sheer sake of it

818
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:44,302
This worm in the apple

819
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:47,169
That slips between our teeth

820
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:49,711
Can make our heart fragrant

821
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:52,313
Our brain too and leave us

822
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:55,077
Its perfume inside us

823
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:00,145
But fleeting love affairs

824
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:02,451
See such futile efforts

825
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:05,119
Their passing caresses

826
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:07,588
Can wear out our bodies

827
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,590
But a true love that lasts

828
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,030
Makes the lovers less fine

829
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:15,464
Often the test of time

830
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,098
Gets the better of us

831
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:21,377
Time for bed, you runt.

832
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:23,309
It's only 4 AM, it's not late.

833
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:26,177
Tomorrow morning at 7,
you have mathematics,

834
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:28,182
chemistry, algebra...

835
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,650
I can sleep in the lounge.

836
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:34,517
Make yourself at home.

837
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:36,182
Okay.

838
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:47,526
I took Scarlett
to the Pepiniere Park yesterday.

839
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:51,038
I hadn't been back since Julie died.

840
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:54,071
It was our park.

841
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:57,210
You took us there when we were kids.

842
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:01,415
It's good you were able
to go back there.

843
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:02,951
I think so, yes.

844
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:06,280
Right...

845
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:10,589
Shall I make my salad?

846
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:12,626
Anyone for cheese?

847
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:14,057
No, thanks.

848
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:16,261
I'll have some salad.

849
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:18,363
Help me make it.

850
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:21,026
I'm not doing it for one.

851
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,300
Jasmine, no hysterics...

852
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:29,139
You're crazy.

853
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:35,078
Ismael, since we're all here,

854
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:37,112
I want to tell you

855
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:41,188
that Mireille and I
want you to have Julie's money.

856
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:44,492
There's not much
on the current account

857
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:46,393
but there are savings

858
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:48,487
on two other accounts.

859
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,690
I don't know if Julie told you...

860
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:57,669
but, after she was hired permanently,
her salary included life insurance.

861
00:57:58,174 --> 00:58:01,075
We've asked for it to be paid to you.

862
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:02,672
There.

863
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,914
All in all, it should amount
to 20,000 euros.

864
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:09,512
No, thank you.

865
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:12,246
I don't want the money. Sorry.

866
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:14,118
No one wants the money.

867
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,454
It should go to the guy who needs it.

868
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,618
I didn't pay for the funeral.

869
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:21,028
It wasn't up to you to pay.

870
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:43,580
Haven't you got
any revision to do today?

871
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:48,687
Is this a new resolution
to help your mum with the dishes?

872
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,520
Xmas is over. You still have hope?

873
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:56,389
Has someone mentioned driving lessons
in this family?

874
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,995
And the old sister here...

875
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,933
Got anything to say?

876
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:04,734
Anything at all?

877
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:06,635
A bit jealous, is she?

878
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,606
Were you offered
driving lessons at 20?

879
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:13,445
Look at me when I speak!

880
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,040
Look at me when I speak!

881
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:16,311
Look at me.

882
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:17,716
And give me a kiss.

883
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,214
Give me a kiss.

884
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:20,584
Because I love you.

885
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:23,020
I've loved you for ages.

886
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:24,093
Disgusting...

887
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:31,465
I'm glad you're okay.
It helps us all.

888
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,786
My eyes gaze

889
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:54,717
At the sky

890
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:58,690
The white clouds against perfect blue

891
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:01,159
No sign of God

892
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,731
In the sky

893
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:06,993
Slow clouds in the broken blue

894
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,934
Sunlight floods

895
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:10,934
The sky

896
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,999
My winter days
are spent forgetting you

897
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,341
And every second

898
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:21,312
Is a fistful of soil

899
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:25,321
Every minute

900
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:29,358
Is like a sob

901
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:33,162
See how hard I fight

902
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:35,196
See how much I lose

903
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,163
In blood and tears

904
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:39,200
In blood and tears

905
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,473
I hurl up

906
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:47,202
At the sky

907
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:51,303
Those pebbles that you painted green

908
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:53,575
But there's no reply

909
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:55,651
From the sky

910
01:00:56,185 --> 01:00:59,382
No rebound on the sea's glassy sheen

911
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,684
Sunlight floods

912
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:02,983
The sky

913
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:07,497
My days in hell spent burying you

914
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,488
And every second

915
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:13,568
Is a fistful of soil

916
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:18,098
Every minute

917
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:22,034
Is like a tomb

918
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:25,638
See how hard I fight

919
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,475
See how much I lose

920
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:29,681
In blood and tears

921
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:32,081
In blood and tears

922
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:38,120
I hope

923
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:39,956
That in the sky

924
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:43,965
Sly little devils
The angels' wings will bend

925
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:46,228
So that you will fall

926
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:47,962
From the sky

927
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:52,030
To my arms,
Iike a gift, a true godsend

928
01:01:57,246 --> 01:01:59,407
But every second

929
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:03,345
Is a fistful of soil

930
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:07,549
But every second

931
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:11,519
Is a fistful of soil

932
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:15,654
Every minute

933
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:19,567
Is like a tomb

934
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,372
See how hard I fight

935
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:25,338
See how much I lose

936
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:27,442
In blood and tears

937
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:30,103
In blood and tears

938
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:20,618
Maud...

939
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:25,490
Can you give me... a shot of vodka?

940
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,727
With your lamb curry?

941
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:52,591
Wake up...

942
01:03:52,695 --> 01:03:54,526
There's someone here.

943
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:01,296
Hi, Ismael. It's past midday.

944
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:07,500
It's okay.

945
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:10,671
What are you doing?

946
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,479
Any coffee left?

947
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:40,166
I'm Julie's sister.

948
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:41,470
Julie's sister?

949
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:43,067
You're Alice?

950
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:44,403
No...

951
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:18,277
Work.

952
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:29,090
What are you doing?

953
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:32,293
- I came to see you. Where are you?
- Behind you.

954
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:36,959
Don't you have classes,
revision, essays?

955
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:39,700
The best thing I can do
is wait for you.

956
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:44,100
That's kind. You're sweet.
But I'm like a huge mystery for you.

957
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,673
You have no idea.

958
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:47,240
What does that mean?

959
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,378
It means you don't know me

960
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:51,207
and shouldn't wait for me.

961
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:56,383
The mystery of your weary gaze

962
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:59,716
A mystery that keeps you in a haze

963
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:03,315
The secret of this daze

964
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:06,760
Secrets are my true craze

965
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:09,997
This barrier between you and me

966
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:13,432
This barrier, who holds the key

967
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:16,903
Cross the border, leave your daze

968
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:20,464
Stand on your land, see my gaze

969
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:25,042
You need to advance

970
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:27,479
To cover the distance

971
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:29,107
Between you and me

972
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:31,711
You'll have to be bold

973
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:34,321
If you want to hold

974
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:35,481
Onto me

975
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,660
A chill grips your land these days

976
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:44,264
What to do in this winter maze

977
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:47,734
You're caught up an icy daze

978
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,427
Everything's frozen

979
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:51,369
Start a blaze

980
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:55,634
You need to advance

981
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,313
To cover the distance

982
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:00,075
Between you and me

983
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,110
You'll have to be bold

984
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:05,119
If you want to hold

985
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:06,711
Onto me

986
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:10,982
The mystery of your weary gaze

987
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:14,885
A mystery I try to appraise

988
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:18,489
The cheap mystery of your daze

989
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:22,196
Doesn't need your arms these days

990
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:31,946
Asshole!

991
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:38,983
Gwendal sent his brother?

992
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:41,056
- What did he say?
- It's not about you.

993
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:45,025
C'mon, I'm not stupid.
He sends his brother to lecture me.

994
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:46,458
He wants to move me.

995
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:48,052
I dumped him. Badly.

996
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:51,031
The guy's an emotional psychopath!

997
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:52,361
Gwendal's great.

998
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:56,336
He's already corrupted you!
I swear, the guy scares me.

999
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:02,044
- Gwendal?
- I don't want to see him again!

1000
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:05,941
Give the keys to his little brother.

1001
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:07,606
I'd been warned.

1002
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:10,411
Bretons are dangerous.
Especially in love!

1003
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:11,315
Here.

1004
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,854
- No way...
- He'll send Erwann back.

1005
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:16,287
Give them to him when you see him.

1006
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:27,066
What?

1007
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,003
Nothing.

1008
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:38,142
- What's up?
- They just changed the front page.

1009
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:39,680
New trainers?

1010
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:42,214
- Like them?
- No, they're ugly.

1011
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:51,452
Well, well...

1012
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:54,352
I gave Ismael the keys.

1013
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:57,728
You can keep the stuff I left,
it's okay.

1014
01:08:57,933 --> 01:09:00,094
Tell your brother sorry from me.

1015
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:28,295
Want a ride home?

1016
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:30,058
- Want a ride home?
- I'm okay.

1017
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,326
You're sure?

1018
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:34,336
See you.

1019
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:49,047
Part Three: The Return

1020
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:51,276
Hey you

1021
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:54,049
Tell me that you love me

1022
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,984
Even if it's a lie

1023
01:09:57,092 --> 01:09:59,458
And we stand no chance

1024
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:03,555
Life is so sad

1025
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,530
Tell me that you love me

1026
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,038
Good evening.

1027
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:23,748
I have to sit outside with the dog.

1028
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:28,113
It's so late.
I waited till my husband dozed off.

1029
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,749
That's okay.
I only just left work.

1030
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:33,761
You didn't tell Ismael you were coming?

1031
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:39,626
Jeanne searched his things
to get your number.

1032
01:10:40,135 --> 01:10:41,397
Something to drink?

1033
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:44,071
No, I'm okay. Thank you.

1034
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:55,982
Ismael told me
about the autopsy results.

1035
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:58,315
Why did he tell you?

1036
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:00,785
Is that important for him?

1037
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:02,354
I think so.

1038
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:05,183
It's important to understand.

1039
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:07,651
I'm not so sure.

1040
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:11,130
We expect doctors
to clear up every mystery,

1041
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:13,929
to unearth the secrets
that explain them...

1042
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,068
I reject that illusion.

1043
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:19,231
Mystery is part of life.

1044
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:23,510
And it merely adds to the horror
of Julie's death.

1045
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:27,011
But that's not why I called.

1046
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:32,946
It may sound silly but I'd like you
to take care of Ismael.

1047
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:35,182
I'd like you to watch over him.

1048
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,986
I'm asking you that.

1049
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:41,721
I called because I heard
you'd moved out.

1050
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:44,726
I'm worried. He's all alone.

1051
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:48,061
He's not alone.
I see him every day.

1052
01:11:50,406 --> 01:11:52,169
And emotionally?

1053
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:55,209
Emotionally what?

1054
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,468
Are you still together?

1055
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:02,006
That's a really weird question.

1056
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:05,410
I only wish him well.

1057
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:08,382
I believe you.

1058
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:14,090
But I don't think you can help people
if they don't want that.

1059
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:18,295
What are you doing here?

1060
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:20,158
Dad sent me.

1061
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:22,194
He woke up?

1062
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:24,238
You weren't there so he woke me.

1063
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,568
I'm only here...

1064
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:28,438
I told him you'd taken Scarlett out.

1065
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:32,246
I'm sorry. Alice.

1066
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:33,372
Go on.

1067
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:36,415
Thank you so much for coming here.

1068
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:40,981
We're counting on you.
You're one of the family.

1069
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:42,523
Can I give you a kiss?

1070
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:46,418
Coming?

1071
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:50,089
I'll give you ten minutes
to yell at each other first.

1072
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:56,131
Can I sit down?

1073
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:59,973
Got a cigarette?

1074
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,101
My exams are stressing me out.

1075
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:03,710
Want to keep the pack?

1076
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:06,178
No, I have to sleep.

1077
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,350
I mustn't smoke all night.

1078
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:10,448
Don't take this badly, okay.

1079
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:13,350
Look on it as kindness on my behalf.

1080
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:16,049
I don't thinkyou're one of the family.

1081
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:17,691
Thank you.

1082
01:13:18,026 --> 01:13:22,122
I don't think you need to be
one of the family to feel grief.

1083
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:23,355
Okay.

1084
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,500
Are you getting over it?

1085
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:27,591
No.

1086
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:31,066
Objectively,
I'm not getting over it at all.

1087
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:32,769
And you?

1088
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:34,035
A little.

1089
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,142
I think so.

1090
01:13:40,816 --> 01:13:42,477
I'll be going.

1091
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:44,878
See you.

1092
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:02,868
Wash

1093
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:09,876
My soiled memory in its muddy stream

1094
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:17,712
With your tongue's tip lick me clean

1095
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:24,949
And remove every single trace

1096
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:28,861
Of what has been

1097
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:32,965
Of what binds me

1098
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:36,629
Of what comes to pass

1099
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,638
Alas

1100
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:44,812
Stalk

1101
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:51,815
Hunt her down for within me she fights

1102
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:59,024
And when you have her in your sights

1103
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:06,366
Do not heed her pleas and cries

1104
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:10,528
You know

1105
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,571
That she has to die

1106
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:17,941
This is her second demise

1107
01:15:20,382 --> 01:15:21,872
And so

1108
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:25,878
Kill her

1109
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:29,619
Again

1110
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:33,523
Weep

1111
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:40,327
I've done that before, all in vain

1112
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:48,108
More sobs just wet the pillows again

1113
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:52,143
Despite my tries

1114
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:55,111
Despite my tries

1115
01:15:57,953 --> 01:15:59,614
I have

1116
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:03,586
A dried up heart

1117
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:07,093
And swollen eyes

1118
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:10,630
I have

1119
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:14,858
A dried up heart

1120
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,430
And swollen eyes

1121
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,536
So burn

1122
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:29,677
Burn when you sink into my bed of ice

1123
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:35,919
It melts when you hug me like a vice

1124
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:41,325
There's no more sorrow

1125
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:44,888
No more gravity

1126
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:48,631
If I have

1127
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:52,706
Your body like a flow

1128
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:56,403
Of lava washing over me

1129
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:03,608
My soiled memory in its muddy stream

1130
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:07,788
Wash

1131
01:17:51,733 --> 01:17:53,633
Did Scarlett wake you?

1132
01:17:56,038 --> 01:17:57,699
I've brought croissants.

1133
01:18:12,587 --> 01:18:14,077
What's going on?

1134
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:17,485
I don't think
I can offer you breakfast.

1135
01:18:17,592 --> 01:18:18,889
Shit...

1136
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:25,765
Can we talk?

1137
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:27,334
I don't have much to say.

1138
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:30,872
So let's walk. We're on a street.
No one will criticize us.

1139
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:34,772
- I'm not criticizing you.
- That's not what I meant.

1140
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:41,543
We deal with grief the way we can.
I'm not judging you.

1141
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,948
But your way is a bit violent.

1142
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:46,850
- You're judging me.
- I'm trying to understand.

1143
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:48,387
Understand what?

1144
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,919
What went on between Julie and you.

1145
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:53,586
That's a challenge. A real challenge.

1146
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:56,387
Understand...

1147
01:18:56,598 --> 01:18:58,623
why you never wanted kids...

1148
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:00,793
why you were in a threesome...

1149
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,697
my sister's life before she died.

1150
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:06,740
And a boy in my bed
explains everything, is that it?

1151
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:10,438
You have the right handbook.
You're lucky.

1152
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:14,377
She must have had reasons
to be unhappy.

1153
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:20,846
I won't say anything.

1154
01:19:21,723 --> 01:19:23,588
It's for the best, right?

1155
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:25,588
No, it's not for the best.

1156
01:19:26,027 --> 01:19:29,019
No one stops you speaking.
Far from it.

1157
01:19:29,564 --> 01:19:33,330
People need to hear you.
My parents especially. Talk to them.

1158
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:35,801
- To say what?
- I don't know. What you feel...

1159
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:39,169
Give me a break.
I already have parents of my own.

1160
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:42,501
You're so self-centred.

1161
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:44,442
You're ungrateful, selfish...

1162
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:47,413
Sure, I'm thoughtless, I'm idiotic...

1163
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:50,349
And I'm a faggot on top of it.
It's terrible...

1164
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:51,919
That's not what I said.

1165
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:55,087
Don't make me look like a dumb bitch!

1166
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:06,089
The same winter sun

1167
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:08,360
The same snapping twigs

1168
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,597
Icy fingertips

1169
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:12,798
Frost on the railings

1170
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:17,141
The same smell of soil
Of earth gone to earth

1171
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:19,408
It'll all be there

1172
01:20:19,614 --> 01:20:21,809
It'll all be there

1173
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:23,915
Except for you

1174
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:27,387
The Pepiniere Park at the week's end

1175
01:20:29,457 --> 01:20:33,120
One more hour, one more hour if that

1176
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:37,723
One more hour before nightfall

1177
01:20:41,636 --> 01:20:43,627
The same temperature

1178
01:20:43,738 --> 01:20:45,501
Down to freezing point

1179
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:48,337
Melancholy beasts

1180
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:50,468
At the gates of the zoo

1181
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:54,780
The same hurried parents,
their children wrapped up warm

1182
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:56,974
It'll all be there

1183
01:20:57,385 --> 01:20:59,410
It'll all be there

1184
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:01,484
Except for you

1185
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:05,954
The Pepiniere Park at the week's end

1186
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:10,826
One more hour, one more hour if that

1187
01:21:11,766 --> 01:21:15,429
One more hour before nightfall

1188
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:21,069
Even if I stay

1189
01:21:21,276 --> 01:21:23,437
And walk where we walked

1190
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,706
Follow the same paths

1191
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:28,146
At the same time of day

1192
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:32,343
Even if I'm the same
Even if I'm beautiful

1193
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:34,516
It'll all be there

1194
01:21:34,956 --> 01:21:36,947
It'll all be there

1195
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:38,952
Except for you

1196
01:21:40,328 --> 01:21:43,627
The Pepiniere Park at the week's end

1197
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:48,433
One more hour, one more hour if that

1198
01:21:49,504 --> 01:21:53,167
One more hour before nightfall

1199
01:21:53,775 --> 01:21:55,504
Night will fall

1200
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:57,041
And then

1201
01:21:57,445 --> 01:21:58,537
Nothing more

1202
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:08,085
Good luck.

1203
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:13,425
Hi, you're back?
Your brother sent you?

1204
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:15,655
Tell him to stop, it's a real drag.

1205
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,391
I'm looking for Ismael.

1206
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:19,933
- Gwendal didn't send you?
- No.

1207
01:22:21,336 --> 01:22:23,463
He didn't tell you we split up?

1208
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:25,095
No. But I noticed.

1209
01:22:25,307 --> 01:22:27,639
- He's seeing someone?
- Yes. Where's Ismael?

1210
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:29,869
He's got a nerve.
No, I don't know.

1211
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:32,741
But I'd like him to help
with the layout.

1212
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:34,906
- He's not answering his phone.
- I know.

1213
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:37,442
- You're not worried?
- Should I be?

1214
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:40,945
I like Bloc Party too.

1215
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:43,815
What's going on, Erwann?

1216
01:22:43,925 --> 01:22:45,392
I hoped he'd be here.

1217
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:46,960
Why do you want Ismael?

1218
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:49,588
I won't hurt him. I'll go.

1219
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:52,496
I have a mock exam tomorrow. Bye.

1220
01:22:57,572 --> 01:22:59,472
Tell me something...

1221
01:22:59,841 --> 01:23:02,969
This may sound crazy
but I just thought of it.

1222
01:23:03,078 --> 01:23:05,171
Are you and Ismael together?

1223
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:06,745
I hope so.

1224
01:23:08,883 --> 01:23:09,815
See you.

1225
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,118
See you!

1226
01:23:14,923 --> 01:23:16,356
The dirty devil...

1227
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:13,740
Why have you come so late

1228
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:16,316
Couldn't you cope

1229
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:18,750
I'd decided not to wait

1230
01:24:18,853 --> 01:24:20,946
I'd given up hope

1231
01:24:21,356 --> 01:24:23,688
Why have you come so late

1232
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:25,851
What brings you here

1233
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:28,625
What bizarre twist of fate

1234
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:31,290
What sudden desire or fear

1235
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:33,560
Why have you come so late

1236
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:35,727
Didn't your mother say, dear

1237
01:24:36,037 --> 01:24:38,437
You shouldn't arrive late

1238
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:40,735
For an invitation sincere

1239
01:24:40,942 --> 01:24:43,433
Without flowers, fine

1240
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:45,706
But it's only polite

1241
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:48,405
To arrive on time

1242
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:50,950
When time is tight

1243
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:03,023
Why have you come so late

1244
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:05,422
When it's all over and said

1245
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:08,031
And your brand new date

1246
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:10,534
Takes my place in your bed

1247
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:13,072
Why have you come so late

1248
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:15,469
You don't have an excuse

1249
01:25:15,577 --> 01:25:17,875
No story to relate

1250
01:25:18,012 --> 01:25:20,344
No way to make a truce

1251
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:22,847
Why have you come so late

1252
01:25:23,017 --> 01:25:24,917
I can't, try as I might

1253
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:27,817
The tales you create

1254
01:25:27,922 --> 01:25:30,015
Of a future bright

1255
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:32,790
Where for now it's not so late

1256
01:25:32,894 --> 01:25:35,055
My angel, it's all so bizarre

1257
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:37,560
If you could face your fate

1258
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:39,994
You'd see how much older we are

1259
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:59,076
BRITTANY

1260
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:29,342
Hey there, kid, all day long

1261
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:33,046
I've sung an idiot's song

1262
01:26:33,254 --> 01:26:34,414
You kept us waiting...

1263
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:37,457
Crawling in the gutter's flow

1264
01:26:37,926 --> 01:26:40,451
From Montparnasse to Chateau d'Eau

1265
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:41,654
Are you okay?

1266
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,658
One drink after another,
God knows where

1267
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:45,790
I'm melancholy.

1268
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:49,097
Zubrowska, Riesling and Piper

1269
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:52,906
At a loss, not knowing what to do

1270
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:56,836
I've come back here to find you

1271
01:26:57,245 --> 01:26:59,941
I run to your arms
To get off the streets

1272
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:01,640
Any noise, I'll kill you.

1273
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:08,550
The delight of your charms
In your soft, warm sheets

1274
01:27:08,656 --> 01:27:11,648
But, alas, instead of that

1275
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:14,894
I thought I heard
''I love you''

1276
01:27:16,264 --> 01:27:18,789
That's his problem, true

1277
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:22,799
I thought I heard
''I love you''

1278
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:26,739
That's his problem, true

1279
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:32,912
So what if you do believe

1280
01:27:33,848 --> 01:27:36,908
So what if I can't be naive

1281
01:27:37,485 --> 01:27:40,886
However lost I may be

1282
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:42,951
None of that between you and me

1283
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:49,094
You want a body, that's okay
A pair of arms, why not

1284
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:56,634
In my bed you can stay
Getting the sheets in a knot

1285
01:27:56,738 --> 01:27:59,400
But if you want to have all that

1286
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:02,974
You need to hear
''I love you''

1287
01:28:04,412 --> 01:28:06,903
You need to hear
''I love you''

1288
01:28:10,318 --> 01:28:13,481
I'm old, a widower and sectarian

1289
01:28:13,855 --> 01:28:17,450
A poor, idiotic vulgarian

1290
01:28:17,892 --> 01:28:20,622
I'm handsome, young and Breton

1291
01:28:20,728 --> 01:28:24,994
I smell of rain, the ocean
and crepes with lemon

1292
01:28:25,433 --> 01:28:28,732
Be quiet now, you little jewel

1293
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:32,829
Once again you're wrong, you fool

1294
01:28:33,007 --> 01:28:35,840
I'm precious if you save me, see

1295
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:39,502
Okay, but none of that
between you and me

1296
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:42,680
You want a body, that's okay

1297
01:28:42,784 --> 01:28:45,082
To get off the streets

1298
01:28:48,623 --> 01:28:50,420
In my bed you can stay

1299
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:52,390
In your soft, warm sheets

1300
01:28:52,493 --> 01:28:55,053
But if you want to have all that

1301
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:58,055
You need to hear...

1302
01:29:03,404 --> 01:29:06,464
Love me less
but love me a long time.

1303
