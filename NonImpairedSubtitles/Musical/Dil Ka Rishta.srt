1
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:45,578
These ties of the heart...

2
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:50,175
are oh so IovabIe

3
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:03,289
And yet, I have such a crazy heart

4
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:37,563
No, not a word!
I've won the round today

5
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:40,332
I've got to Bombay before Jai!
Sushma...

6
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,825
You're Iate again, dad.
- Who's that...?

7
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:56,515
My fIight got deIayed
in London by 2 hours

8
00:03:56,516 --> 00:03:58,617
Or I wouId sureIy have
beaten you at it this time

9
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:01,120
That's aII right.
Try next time

10
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:04,522
So... where is she?
In the room?

11
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,859
Who?
- The girI

12
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,296
Where is my daughter-in-Iaw to be?
You've returned empty-handed again?

13
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,801
You're the one the girIs
are crazy about, dad

14
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:19,135
We can aIways taIk about the girI.
How about wishing Mom first?

15
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:23,542
Have you met her?

16
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:26,808
I'm the first to arrive, but it's
your right to greet her first

17
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:41,160
I'm Iate. It's my mistake

18
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:43,429
And your son wouIdn't meet you
because he wanted me...

19
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:49,330
to wish you a happy birthday first

20
00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:03,616
You've given me a great son.
But there's one hitch

21
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:05,284
He hasn't brought me
a daughter-in-Iaw yet

22
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:08,516
A daughter-in-Iaw isn't everything...
aII right, she is

23
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:12,524
I promise, I'II bring one
by the next year

24
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,460
But you're with me, aren't you?

25
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:19,632
He's stiII not wiIIing to beIieve
that the pIane-crash...

26
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:24,127
he stiII thinks that you wiII
return some day

27
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:50,323
I mean, I'II get a wrong shot

28
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:10,275
One moment

29
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,282
Give me the camera and stand
with Jai. I'II take the pictures

30
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:26,530
Say paneer (cottage cheese)
- It's cheese, dad

31
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:32,400
Cheese is too EngIish, son. Paneer
brings out the Indianness in you

32
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:34,530
Say paneer

33
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:45,808
Wow! God has given you
your souImate...

34
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:51,147
What's happening, dad?
- I sometimes think...

35
00:06:51,224 --> 00:06:55,094
you do make a great coupIe.
- CoupIe...?

36
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:59,098
I'm Jai's best friend.
Not girIfriend

37
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:02,501
No marriage for Anita.
OnIy sociaI-service, right?

38
00:07:02,502 --> 00:07:07,098
SociaI-service...? You mean you do
sociaI service in those cIothes?

39
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,773
It isn't necessary to wear hand-spun
cIothes for sociaI service

40
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:14,279
What is necessary is to make peopIe
Iike you doIe out the money

41
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,114
I get it! I was onIy taking
a picture of yours...

42
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:21,517
and you're getting me on fiIm!
Sit down and chat

43
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:25,113
You may Ieave, uncIe. But you're
coming with me tomorrow, Jai

44
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:30,395
Apart from earning money, you must
aIso do some charity in Iife

45
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:33,298
It's good for the souI.
- But dad's waiting for me

46
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:36,301
It's onIy for ten minutes, Jai!
- Now Iook, Anita

47
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:40,398
You spoke about charity, I agreed.
You wanted a Iift, and I gave it

48
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,474
And now...
- Give me ten minutes

49
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:48,034
I want you to the meet the principaI

50
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:53,252
You haven't taken an appointment?
- No. She's here at 10 every day

51
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:55,187
I'm not meeting her
without an appointment

52
00:07:55,188 --> 00:07:57,156
You stiII have 9 minutes.
Go and take the appointment

53
00:07:57,157 --> 00:08:00,092
You're giving haIf a miIIion
in charity, Jai

54
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:03,495
8 minutes...
7 minutes

55
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:05,088
6...

56
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:11,999
5,4,3,2,1 ... time out!

57
00:09:58,544 --> 00:10:02,310
What do I see...?
You're studying?

58
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,218
You passed out of schooI
because I bribed them...

59
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:12,157
and bought the coIIege you studied in.
And you're now studying?

60
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:17,663
You've fractured your finger?
No?

61
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:20,565
Know what? I bribed my way
through education too

62
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:26,330
I don't have the brains to understand
that. What are you saying?

63
00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:41,586
Not you, dad.
- So?

64
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:46,858
So there's a girI...

65
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:50,351
My son's in Iove!
Fantastic!

66
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:52,798
And you've been scanning
the books for romantic Iines?

67
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,792
I'II give you the best possibIe
Iine they've used in Iove. Say...

68
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:03,540
I know

69
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:07,145
That's exactIy what
I'm trying to memorise

70
00:11:07,146 --> 00:11:09,815
I Iove you isn't something
you got to memorise

71
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:14,152
But if you stiII must,
repeat it after me

72
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:18,156
I'd teII her, if she couId Iisten.
- What does that mean?

73
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:21,320
She can neither hear nor speak

74
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:32,834
Now pIease don't pIay the
viIIain between us, okay?

75
00:11:35,174 --> 00:11:38,337
In your happiness Iies mine, my son.
And it's good too

76
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:41,513
She can't hear, nor speak.
She won't know when we fight!

77
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:42,681
Let's go...
- Where to?

78
00:11:42,682 --> 00:11:44,783
You're the groom, I'm the guest.
Let's go and bring her

79
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:47,352
No, dad. I don't know
anything about her yet

80
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:50,288
You drive your car at
the speed of a jet...

81
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:53,392
but you move at snaiI's pace in Iove?
Find out about her foIks

82
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:58,884
I'II prepare for the wedding

83
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:15,647
WouId you know of the
beautifuI teacher... ?

84
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:22,049
Where's the PrincipaI's office?
- Over there

85
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:16,221
I'm going to have word with her...

86
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,812
You went away yesterday!

87
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:31,816
Mr Jai... who wanted
to see you yesterday

88
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:35,554
Have you brought your cheque today?
- Oh yes

89
00:14:35,555 --> 00:14:38,657
Your cheque.
- You can speak!

90
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:41,159
You can even hear!
- You can hear and speak too!

91
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,324
What did you think? That everyone
here can neither hear nor speak?

92
00:14:45,565 --> 00:14:50,559
Happens, you know. PeopIe often
mistake me for a deaf and dumb

93
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:54,506
I don't want to
give you this money

94
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:57,772
Not just this money.
I want to sponsor the whoIe show

95
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:01,846
I have a condition.
- What?

96
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:06,113
I want to heIp in organising the show.
- You won't be abIe to do it

97
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:12,280
I mean... what wiII you do?
- I can do just about anything

98
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,794
Dusting the chairs, perhaps.
Or hammering in a naiI...

99
00:15:15,795 --> 00:15:18,330
or just gaping at you.
- What?

100
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:22,290
I mean, you can hear and speak.
So can I...

101
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:28,629
it's these kids who
need to be Iooked after

102
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:12,117
Who's there...?
Who is it?

103
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:16,111
Me. OnIy me
- What are you doing up there?

104
00:16:16,322 --> 00:16:19,519
FoIIowing you...
I mean, with Iights

105
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:23,528
That isn't your job.
PIease come down

106
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:29,623
I toId you I couId do
just about anything, I...

107
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:35,627
Are you aII right?

108
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:41,307
The sand saved me

109
00:16:52,758 --> 00:16:56,489
You asked me to come down...
I took the shortcut

110
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:27,521
Ever since I feII
in Iove with you...

111
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:39,804
I can't go to sIeep,
nor do I have any peace

112
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:53,585
Your choice.
- How did you know?

113
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:56,755
When one gets cIose to someone...

114
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:58,246
go on

115
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:04,763
one gets to know about
her Iikes and disIikes

116
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:10,100
I aIways thought I'd have to
be very formaI with the sponsor

117
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:14,272
But you...
- No formaIities

118
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:19,263
No formaIities.

119
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:23,772
So...?

120
00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:28,518
You've become a part
of our Iives so soon...

121
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:34,279
you don't seem to be
an outsider at aII

122
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:53,478
Like it?
- Oh yes

123
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:56,247
And Mr Sponsor wants me to
wear it during the show?

124
00:18:56,248 --> 00:18:59,484
Oh no. ActuaIIy...

125
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:03,478
I'm Iucky to have the opportunity
to wear such a beautifuI neckIace

126
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:11,756
Watch it

127
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:19,771
What are you doing?
- For memory

128
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:21,706
One day to go for the show.
After that...

129
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:25,109
After that it'II aII be over.
This tension and stuff

130
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,279
And our reIationship, too.
- Jai...

131
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,771
reIationships are made.
They never end

132
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:56,307
What are you doing here?
- Won't you say something to her?

133
00:19:56,308 --> 00:20:02,299
Are you crazy? I was just...
- TeII her how you feeI

134
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:17,818
Put some sincerity into it. It must
Iook as if you can't Iive without her

135
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:25,169
No, it's not happening

136
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:28,172
Oh go away...
you're ruining aII my confidence

137
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:32,510
Dad, pIease pIay Tia for a whiIe

138
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:38,002
Come aIong, dad

139
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:54,232
Shut that mouth... pIease

140
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:57,293
Tia, there's something
I want to teII you

141
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:11,816
Ever since I have seen you...

142
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:15,153
why're you gIaring
at me Iike that, dad?

143
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:16,888
Forget it, Jai.
It's not your cup of tea

144
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:19,257
Looks Iike I'II have to do something.
I'II teII her

145
00:21:19,258 --> 00:21:22,318
Don't you dare say a word to her.
- I wiII too!

146
00:21:33,572 --> 00:21:39,063
Goodness...

147
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:20,816
Goodness me...

148
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:31,323
my Iove, you are the one
I have faIIen in Iove with

149
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:38,569
Goodness!

150
00:22:45,177 --> 00:22:49,341
With my eyes, I have
secretIy toId you that I yieId

151
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:40,564
How wiII I meet your gaze?
I feeI so very shy

152
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,668
How wiII I Iive
without seeing you?

153
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:49,330
It aImost kiIIs me

154
00:23:51,343 --> 00:23:55,780
It goes berserk in Iove with you...
my ankIets won't Iisten to me

155
00:23:56,448 --> 00:24:00,782
Pining torments me.
Love has been my undoing

156
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:11,119
Goodness!

157
00:24:35,154 --> 00:24:37,421
With your name on my Iips,
I spend my days...

158
00:24:37,422 --> 00:24:39,824
I spend my nights pining

159
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:44,558
I remember every moment
the naughty things you did

160
00:24:50,335 --> 00:24:54,772
My Iips thirst for Iove.
The fire rages on

161
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:59,768
How wiII I reason with my heart?
It's so crazy

162
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:09,777
Goodness!

163
00:25:16,128 --> 00:25:20,121
You are the one I have Ioved

164
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:27,796
Goodness!

165
00:25:34,146 --> 00:25:38,549
You are my beIoved.
You are the one I Iove

166
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:11,782
Thanks for saying yes

167
00:26:11,783 --> 00:26:14,518
This humbIe gift... for you

168
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:18,122
To the beginning
of our new reIationship

169
00:26:18,123 --> 00:26:23,614
To the beginning
of our new reIationship

170
00:26:25,797 --> 00:26:29,790
I'II first have to say I Iove you
I've had it!

171
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:35,359
Whom are you taIking to?

172
00:26:40,145 --> 00:26:43,308
I'm gIad I met you.
I personaIIy wanted to thank you

173
00:26:43,548 --> 00:26:45,416
It's because of you that this
charity show is a success

174
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:48,319
Oh no, I onIy put in some money.
- Not just the money

175
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,748
You have put your heart in it too
- ActuaIIy, you're right

176
00:26:56,094 --> 00:27:01,498
And I'm aIso gIad I've met you.
Because I too...

177
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:05,703
Yes? Go on.
What is it?

178
00:27:05,704 --> 00:27:11,263
May I say it?
- Of course, go ahead

179
00:27:30,128 --> 00:27:33,531
That's aII I've Iearnt...
for you

180
00:27:33,532 --> 00:27:39,796
The first time I saw you,
I thought you were...

181
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:43,140
I've been aII over the worId

182
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:47,134
But no girI has ever made
a pIace in my heart

183
00:27:57,422 --> 00:28:02,981
And I think you too...

184
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:35,281
Here's your beIoved, Tia!

185
00:28:40,232 --> 00:28:44,532
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
But my pIane Iet me down again

186
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:49,807
What are you doing out here?
There's no one around...

187
00:28:49,808 --> 00:28:53,244
has the show-time changed?
- The show is over, Raj

188
00:28:53,478 --> 00:28:56,080
ShaII we go?
- Looks Iike I'm in for troubIe

189
00:28:56,081 --> 00:29:00,980
Sure, Iet's go

190
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:05,089
Tia, when is this programme of
yours going to be teIecast again?

191
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:11,095
After aII, I'II have to
watch your programme too

192
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:15,499
PIease tighten your seat-beIt.
We're ready for take-off

193
00:29:33,785 --> 00:29:36,787
Say something, Tia... pIease

194
00:29:36,788 --> 00:29:41,122
TeII me something. If you were
angry with me, why did you hug me?

195
00:29:42,127 --> 00:29:46,297
And since you have hugged me,
why are you angry with me?

196
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:48,399
Say something, pIease

197
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,801
If not anything something good,
you may even scoId me

198
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:57,540
You're not going to find
a Iover Iike me, Tia...

199
00:29:58,543 --> 00:30:04,807
I'm begging to be scoIded!

200
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:09,314
I can make you open your mouth.
Which ice-cream wiII you have?

201
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,322
Give me an ice-cream that
wiII change the Iady's mood

202
00:30:17,662 --> 00:30:20,825
Be ready. The moment they
waIk in, switch that on

203
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:24,502
And you... shower rose-petaIs
the moment he arrives

204
00:30:24,503 --> 00:30:28,837
Astride the mare
goes the bridegroom...

205
00:30:29,174 --> 00:30:34,378
with the sword tied to his waist

206
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:38,440
He Iooks so proud to have
found a beautifuI bride...

207
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:45,075
they do make a great coupIe

208
00:30:59,304 --> 00:31:02,139
Raj...
- At Iast, she speaks!

209
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:06,810
Looks Iike the ice-cream
has worked its magic

210
00:31:06,811 --> 00:31:10,144
Yes?
- Do you Iove me?

211
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:12,141
Love...?

212
00:31:13,151 --> 00:31:17,315
That's a very crooked question.
- TeII me

213
00:31:17,822 --> 00:31:21,314
Tia, we've known each other
for four years

214
00:31:22,561 --> 00:31:26,163
The first time I met you,
I feIt a sense of beIonging

215
00:31:26,164 --> 00:31:29,327
Yours is the face that Iingers
before my eyes aII day and night

216
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:33,827
Whether I'm busy or far away...
you're aIways cIose to my heart

217
00:31:34,172 --> 00:31:38,842
You're the one I wiII
Iive and die for

218
00:31:38,843 --> 00:31:43,180
What I actuaIIy mean
to say is that...

219
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:47,184
I want to grow oId with you

220
00:31:47,185 --> 00:31:51,849
And some day, on this very bench,
I want to Iie in your Iap...

221
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,525
and have an ice-cream

222
00:31:54,526 --> 00:31:58,529
Is this what they caII Iove?

223
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:03,300
Why don't we get married then?
- Married...?

224
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:06,532
There's a probIem.
- What?

225
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:12,810
TeII me, Raj

226
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:16,804
It's Iike this, Tia.
The two of us do want to get married

227
00:32:19,551 --> 00:32:25,315
But who wiII marry us?

228
00:32:31,162 --> 00:32:34,832
I had decided to bring your
daughter-in-Iaw home today

229
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:38,826
I even proposed to her.
But at the Iast moment...

230
00:32:50,582 --> 00:32:53,779
I'II do my best, Ma.
I'II do what I can

231
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,784
God... why does this happen
onIy to my son?

232
00:33:01,126 --> 00:33:05,790
He couIdn't forget his mother...
how wiII he ever forget his Iove?

233
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:14,135
Who's caIIing?
- I'm her friend

234
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:20,030
Tia, caII for you

235
00:33:30,322 --> 00:33:33,553
Who is it?
- Your friend

236
00:33:39,564 --> 00:33:43,330
I have a request, Tia.
I want to meet you

237
00:33:44,836 --> 00:33:47,905
Jai, if there's something you
want to say, teII me now...

238
00:33:47,906 --> 00:33:50,574
No, Tia. I've got to
taIk to you in person

239
00:33:50,575 --> 00:33:53,444
I'm sorry, Jai.
I won't be abIe to come

240
00:33:53,445 --> 00:33:57,506
Once... onIy once.
Remember what you said?

241
00:33:57,615 --> 00:34:00,517
ReIationships are born.
They never end

242
00:34:00,518 --> 00:34:03,287
Do come for whatever reIationship
you think we share

243
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:06,780
Cafe Bistro, at 5 this evening.
I'II wait for you

244
00:34:08,793 --> 00:34:14,284
You wiII come, won't you?

245
00:34:35,153 --> 00:34:36,552
Come

246
00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:01,272
What is the matter, Jai? There are
no peopIe in your restaurant...?

247
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:07,780
There wiII be no one.
It's booked onIy for you

248
00:35:11,122 --> 00:35:16,126
Your choice

249
00:35:16,127 --> 00:35:22,123
Tia, after the show got over,
when you were no Ionger with me...

250
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:26,294
I feIt as if there was
a huge void in my Iife

251
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:31,139
Jai, you know I...
- I know everything, Tia

252
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:35,803
What you perhaps don't know is that
I run a huge business empire

253
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:42,310
M.D.'s and CEO's the worId over
Iong to spend time with me and I...

254
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:46,657
I Iong for you, Tia

255
00:35:46,658 --> 00:35:50,560
You have the whoIe worId to
get on with your business, Jai

256
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:55,265
So why must you want to make my
IittIe worId your business?

257
00:35:59,103 --> 00:36:03,106
Because I'm in Iove with you, Tia

258
00:36:03,107 --> 00:36:06,777
I want to marry you

259
00:36:06,778 --> 00:36:10,509
You can't turn an acquaintance of
a few days into such a reIationship

260
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:14,518
Why not?
- Ties of the heart...

261
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:19,513
that you want to forge with me,
I aIready share with Raj

262
00:36:20,124 --> 00:36:23,293
So why are you...
- Now Iook, Tia...

263
00:36:23,294 --> 00:36:27,130
if you wish, we couId right now...
- Excuse me

264
00:36:27,131 --> 00:36:30,532
If you've caIIed me here to seek
an answer to your proposaI...

265
00:36:31,135 --> 00:36:35,305
my answer is No, Mr Jai Mehta

266
00:36:35,306 --> 00:36:40,797
Thank you very much.
I'm getting Iate

267
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:48,144
I was so sure that Tia Ioves you.
She Iooked so happy with you

268
00:36:48,553 --> 00:36:52,250
How couId she refuse you and go away
with that guy on the mobike?

269
00:36:53,758 --> 00:36:58,495
Cheer up, my son

270
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,498
Now Iisten to this!
There was this boy Iike you...

271
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:04,101
who went crazy Iooking for his girI

272
00:37:04,102 --> 00:37:06,703
And someone gave him the idea
of advertising in the newspapers

273
00:37:06,704 --> 00:37:09,773
Wanted wife
The boy agreed

274
00:37:09,774 --> 00:37:13,277
He issued an ad...
Wanted Wife

275
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:18,511
He got thousands of Ietters in a week.
One thing was common in aII of them

276
00:37:18,783 --> 00:37:23,516
Guess what...? Take my wife away
any time you want to they said!

277
00:37:28,126 --> 00:37:30,794
I'm onIy trying to change your mood

278
00:37:30,795 --> 00:37:34,287
She came there, didn't she?
That's it, she's interested then

279
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:37,801
Her parents couId have
made a commitment eIsewhere

280
00:37:37,802 --> 00:37:40,804
But she need not necessariIy
agree with it

281
00:37:40,805 --> 00:37:43,540
She isn't married yet, my son.
You stiII have a chance

282
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:47,644
Don't Iose hope

283
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:51,547
Keep trying, your appeaI
for Iove wiII be upheId some day

284
00:37:56,754 --> 00:38:00,087
WeIcome, Mr Late Latif.
- Me...?

285
00:38:01,593 --> 00:38:03,193
Who are you?

286
00:38:03,194 --> 00:38:05,495
The master has sent these fIowers
and a Ietter for you

287
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:09,762
He has aIso asked for a repIy
- RoyaI styIe, aII right!

288
00:38:25,783 --> 00:38:29,275
These fIowers are testimony
of my Iove for you

289
00:38:30,121 --> 00:38:34,124
And I wait for the day
when you wiII Iove me too

290
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:38,289
The dust and poIIution of this city
couId make your beauty wither away

291
00:38:39,297 --> 00:38:43,791
This is the key to the car at
your door-step. Your birthday gift

292
00:38:44,135 --> 00:38:49,796
From me.
Yours, Jai

293
00:38:52,744 --> 00:38:58,235
Give this back to him

294
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:06,256
Tia, teII Raj I'II be there
in a moment

295
00:39:06,257 --> 00:39:09,749
Raj hasn't arrived yet, Mother.
Someone rang the beII by mistake...

296
00:39:15,433 --> 00:39:17,367
You're back again?

297
00:39:17,368 --> 00:39:20,496
I Iove you so much, I keep
coming back to get a scoIding

298
00:39:21,105 --> 00:39:23,774
This bouquet?
Where did you find it?

299
00:39:23,775 --> 00:39:26,309
A gift of nature.
- Nature?

300
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:28,612
Yes. We were brought up
on wind, dust and water...

301
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:31,114
so nature obviousIy gave it...
- Where did you find it?

302
00:39:31,115 --> 00:39:34,278
I found it Iying outside and Iiked it.
I thought I'd pick it up for you

303
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:38,121
Isn't it nice?
- Can't you even buy a bouquet?

304
00:39:38,122 --> 00:39:40,791
So you're Iate again?

305
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:42,859
How are you?
- Not nice at aII

306
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,395
Nice fIowers.
- He's brought someone eIse's bouquet

307
00:39:45,396 --> 00:39:48,524
He can't even remember to buy fIowers!
- Your Iove makes me forget everything

308
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,133
Why don't you forget coming here?
Or where I Iive? Or me instead?

309
00:39:52,236 --> 00:39:54,538
I forgot that too,
but I had Ieft my Iicence here

310
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:57,541
I saw a cop and remembered.
So where's my Iicence?

311
00:39:57,542 --> 00:40:00,811
Which means... he doesn't even
remember my birthday!

312
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:04,314
My God! Is it your birthday?

313
00:40:04,315 --> 00:40:07,818
No wonder you're Iooking so good today.
For the first time ever

314
00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:11,655
Look at him, Mother!

315
00:40:11,656 --> 00:40:14,825
You know how Raj Ioves
to tease you

316
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:17,828
He can't digest his food
tiII he puIIs your Ieg

317
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:21,164
Why did you do that...? You
couId've spared her at Ieast today

318
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:27,065
It's her birthday.
Now go and pIacate her

319
00:40:27,171 --> 00:40:33,333
You Iook very beautifuI
today... reaIIy

320
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:40,350
On this auspicious occasion
of her birthday...

321
00:40:40,351 --> 00:40:43,582
I think I'd rather marry Tia
and take her away...

322
00:40:43,688 --> 00:40:46,356
instead of giving her something

323
00:40:46,357 --> 00:40:48,348
What say?

324
00:40:49,861 --> 00:40:53,524
You're right. I think it's time
the two of you got married

325
00:40:53,798 --> 00:40:57,131
But are you going to bother Tia
even after the wedding?

326
00:40:57,301 --> 00:41:02,139
AbsoIuteIy. This fun and Iaughter
is what Iife is aII about

327
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,142
So Iet's decide the rest
of the things too

328
00:41:05,143 --> 00:41:08,806
The rest of the things...?
- I have no one of my own

329
00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:11,648
So I'II myseIf have to
taIk about the dowry, right?

330
00:41:11,649 --> 00:41:13,310
Dowry...?

331
00:41:14,152 --> 00:41:19,556
As you know, Raj... everything
I possess, beIongs to Tia

332
00:41:20,324 --> 00:41:24,161
What eIse do you want?
TeII me

333
00:41:24,162 --> 00:41:27,831
Think it over, mother.
- Raj, what are you...?

334
00:41:27,832 --> 00:41:32,169
I've thought it over.
What do you want, teII me

335
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:36,173
You, mother

336
00:41:36,174 --> 00:41:40,577
I want a mother in dowry

337
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:43,847
I don't want to be orphaned
aII over again

338
00:41:43,848 --> 00:41:47,181
But a mother does not Iive
in her daughter's house

339
00:41:47,585 --> 00:41:50,353
She Iives in her son's house,
doesn't she?

340
00:41:50,354 --> 00:41:56,789
Even if you don't caII me your son,
treat me Iike one, mother

341
00:41:57,128 --> 00:42:02,619
Say yes mother

342
00:42:07,872 --> 00:42:14,307
I have everything today, Mother.
Everything

343
00:42:18,316 --> 00:42:21,547
Take your girIfriend to a seven-star
and she says she Ioves you

344
00:42:22,553 --> 00:42:25,155
Here's the seven-star

345
00:42:25,156 --> 00:42:29,826
Wait... where are we going?

346
00:42:29,827 --> 00:42:32,318
Get down

347
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,331
Here?
- Where eIse?

348
00:42:34,332 --> 00:42:37,824
But you said...
- Seven-star. This is the one

349
00:42:38,336 --> 00:42:41,838
Even if it's a smaII pIace,
one must have a Iarge-heart

350
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,842
You got to be hungry to eat.
Are you hungry?

351
00:42:45,843 --> 00:42:47,834
Come on

352
00:42:50,848 --> 00:42:53,783
Do something speciaI today...
it's Tia's birthday

353
00:42:53,784 --> 00:42:55,285
WiII be done, sir

354
00:42:55,286 --> 00:42:59,789
PIease sit down

355
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:02,792
I'II be back in a moment, sir

356
00:43:02,793 --> 00:43:08,284
What do you think of the pIace?

357
00:43:29,553 --> 00:43:32,822
Why've you kept the pIant here?
- It's the Iady's birthday, sir

358
00:43:32,823 --> 00:43:38,314
Oh yes, it is

359
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:50,163
You've changed the whoIe scene.
Why did you have to spend so much?

360
00:43:50,574 --> 00:43:56,269
I have... so it's aII right

361
00:43:57,782 --> 00:44:02,116
Such a huge cake... for me?
- No. It's not our cake

362
00:44:02,286 --> 00:44:04,621
Mister... pIease take the cake away.
It's not ours

363
00:44:04,622 --> 00:44:09,292
Stop kidding, Raj. It even has
my name written on it

364
00:44:09,293 --> 00:44:13,129
One moment... Iet me confirm

365
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:16,633
Any girI by the name Tia in here?
You, perhaps...?

366
00:44:16,634 --> 00:44:19,803
I think you're the onIy one
who's Tia

367
00:44:19,804 --> 00:44:22,138
May I cut the cake then?
- No

368
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:28,301
Aren't you supposed to cIose
your eyes and make a wish first?

369
00:44:36,153 --> 00:44:39,222
I've done it.
Raj, what are you...?

370
00:44:39,223 --> 00:44:44,714
Nothing. Just cut the cake

371
00:45:21,799 --> 00:45:24,234
Where are you taking it?
- Let me serve dinner, sir

372
00:45:24,235 --> 00:45:26,803
What for? We're going
to be happy with the cake

373
00:45:26,804 --> 00:45:29,639
I'II have the upper-deck,
Tia'II have the Iower one

374
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,475
Nice joke...
- I'm not joking!

375
00:45:32,476 --> 00:45:38,308
Raj, I'II never forget
this IoveIy evening!

376
00:45:39,483 --> 00:45:42,552
Neither wiII I.
After aII those dishes...

377
00:45:42,553 --> 00:45:48,044
I mean, we have yet to eat

378
00:45:51,562 --> 00:45:55,598
PIease get me the biII.
- Your biII has been paid, sir

379
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,260
Paid?

380
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:02,505
But pIease give me the biII.
- As I said, sir...

381
00:46:02,506 --> 00:46:05,275
Maybe I Iook Iike a tramp,
but I'm a decent guy

382
00:46:05,276 --> 00:46:08,611
You can adjust with me, if I'm short
of dough. You can keep my watch

383
00:46:08,612 --> 00:46:11,381
Sir, you do crack nice jokes.
- I don't crack jokes at aII

384
00:46:11,382 --> 00:46:13,216
I'm a serious man.
- So am I...

385
00:46:13,217 --> 00:46:19,015
and I teII you seriousIy
that your biII has been paid

386
00:46:24,528 --> 00:46:26,529
This is strange!
Who couId have paid the biII?

387
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:32,021
I know who paid it.
- Who?

388
00:46:32,803 --> 00:46:37,793
Was it fun?

389
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:42,802
Jai, I've toId you in pIain terms that
there is no pIace for you in my Iife

390
00:46:43,314 --> 00:46:45,882
So why did you...?
- So you're the one who sent...

391
00:46:45,883 --> 00:46:48,651
those fIowers and the cake...?
I'm very happy to meet you

392
00:46:48,652 --> 00:46:52,755
What makes me more happy is that you
have changed the coIour of our evening

393
00:46:52,756 --> 00:46:56,248
Not at aII. Such a big day in
Tia's Iife and this dingy pIace...?

394
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,495
I thought I'd make it
worthy of Tia

395
00:46:58,496 --> 00:47:01,764
Mr Jai Mehta, maybe you're
a big man...

396
00:47:01,765 --> 00:47:07,504
but you have no right
to caII someone smaII

397
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:10,273
And who gave you the right
to do that? Who...?

398
00:47:10,274 --> 00:47:13,109
And you caII Raj...
- Not me, Tia...

399
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:16,279
he caIIed the eatery smaII.
- You don't understand, Raj

400
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,515
He sponsored the show
at our schooI

401
00:47:18,516 --> 00:47:23,112
He even proposed to me...
but I turned him down

402
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:26,222
Ever since, he has been trying
to impress me. He's trying to...

403
00:47:26,223 --> 00:47:29,784
create misunderstandings between us.
- Tia, is there room...

404
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,129
for misunderstanding between us?

405
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:35,532
Jai-saheb, we aren't married yet

406
00:47:35,533 --> 00:47:37,634
But we've divorced each other
severaI times

407
00:47:37,635 --> 00:47:41,404
Just think what a deep reIationship
we must share

408
00:47:41,405 --> 00:47:45,307
It's not your mistake, I must say.
Tia is indeed very beautifuI

409
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:49,142
I caII it my good-fortune
that Tia's in Iove with me

410
00:47:50,548 --> 00:47:55,076
ActuaIIy, intimacy between hearts
can never be forced

411
00:47:55,252 --> 00:47:57,754
It happens on its own

412
00:47:57,755 --> 00:48:02,492
Now for the biII you paid...

413
00:48:02,493 --> 00:48:06,759
PIease keep it.
For Tia's sake

414
00:48:07,264 --> 00:48:11,257
Your arrangements were exceIIent.
The food and especiaIIy the music

415
00:48:19,777 --> 00:48:22,779
See? This is how my Raj is

416
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:25,281
If you're so fond of
making arrangements...

417
00:48:25,282 --> 00:48:28,774
my wedding is coming up next week.
With Raj

418
00:48:57,081 --> 00:49:02,075
This reIationship of hearts
is so IoveabIe

419
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:14,254
And yet, we are
so crazed at heart

420
00:49:15,266 --> 00:49:20,260
We are madIy in Iove
with each other...

421
00:49:27,511 --> 00:49:32,778
the whoIe worId knows that

422
00:49:34,218 --> 00:49:39,121
This reIationship of hearts
is so IoveabIe

423
00:50:04,815 --> 00:50:09,548
Your kiss on my eyes, my Iove...

424
00:50:10,654 --> 00:50:15,557
your kiss on my eyes, my Iove...

425
00:50:23,267 --> 00:50:27,829
has made me bIossom

426
00:50:29,239 --> 00:50:33,835
You have made me bIossom

427
00:50:35,179 --> 00:50:40,344
And yet, we are
so crazy at heart

428
00:50:41,185 --> 00:50:46,350
This reIationship of hearts
is so IoveabIe

429
00:51:13,817 --> 00:51:18,811
In IoneIiness, my Iove...

430
00:51:20,324 --> 00:51:25,318
in IoneIiness, my Iove...

431
00:51:32,669 --> 00:51:37,163
I have caIIed out
to you very often

432
00:51:44,348 --> 00:51:49,581
We sure are crazy at heart

433
00:51:50,687 --> 00:51:55,784
This reIationship of hearts
is so IoveabIe

434
00:52:38,168 --> 00:52:39,836
Jai...?
- Raj?

435
00:52:39,837 --> 00:52:42,171
What a co-incidence!
My motorbike has staIIed

436
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:47,663
Come, I'II give you a ride

437
00:52:51,181 --> 00:52:54,275
So where wiII you go?
- The hospitaI

438
00:52:54,451 --> 00:52:57,511
Bikes are repaired in a garage,
not hospitaIs

439
00:52:59,122 --> 00:53:02,124
Tia's in hospitaI

440
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:07,616
Which hospitaI?
- Avon

441
00:53:08,532 --> 00:53:12,134
What happened to Tia?
- That which happens after marriage

442
00:53:12,135 --> 00:53:17,626
Tia's becoming a mother

443
00:53:20,143 --> 00:53:22,812
I don't drink

444
00:53:22,813 --> 00:53:25,481
Jai, my famiIy wiII
be compIete today

445
00:53:25,482 --> 00:53:29,218
Tia wiII be a mother
and I - a father

446
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:32,822
This is the biggest joy in the
Iives of those in Iove, isn't it?

447
00:53:32,823 --> 00:53:36,158
Oh yes, I guess so

448
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:38,561
I forgot to ask about you

449
00:53:38,562 --> 00:53:40,329
You've grown a stubbIe...
no probIems, I hope?

450
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:44,562
Forget about me.
You're becoming a father and...

451
00:53:44,668 --> 00:53:48,570
starting a famiIy. How does it feeI?
- Fantastic

452
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:53,109
ShouId I sing, dance, go berserk...?
I don't know what to do

453
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:57,513
Because I'm an orphan, I know
how precious the Iove of parents is

454
00:53:59,516 --> 00:54:02,781
But my chiId isn't destined to
Iead the Iife of an orphan

455
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,783
He'II get Iove from his
mother, his grandmother...

456
00:54:07,524 --> 00:54:11,790
and what is most important...
the name of his father. My name

457
00:54:13,297 --> 00:54:16,528
When someone asks him what
his Papa's name is...

458
00:54:19,136 --> 00:54:22,405
he'II say in his
babyish way, Laj

459
00:54:22,406 --> 00:54:26,142
My papa's name is Laj

460
00:54:26,143 --> 00:54:29,806
The happiness shows in your eyes.
- Yes, I've found aII reIationships

461
00:54:31,315 --> 00:54:36,806
ReIationships of the heart

462
00:54:41,658 --> 00:54:45,161
Aren't you coming in?

463
00:54:45,162 --> 00:54:51,324
You ought to spend this time
with Tia aIone

464
00:54:55,606 --> 00:54:57,096
And Raj...

465
00:54:58,275 --> 00:55:04,608
shouId you ever need something...

466
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:17,727
Tia, here comes your beIoved
The nurse toId me it's a baby-boy!

467
00:55:17,794 --> 00:55:21,297
Here he comes. Late, as usuaI
- I'm not Iate...

468
00:55:21,298 --> 00:55:26,292
CarefuI!
- So sweet! My IittIe boy!

469
00:55:27,304 --> 00:55:30,306
He's taken after me, hasn't he?
- Yes

470
00:55:30,307 --> 00:55:33,809
But his eyes are Iike Tia's

471
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:38,147
His eyes, nose, cheeks,
ears, mouth...

472
00:55:38,148 --> 00:55:42,251
are aII Iike Tia's.
The rest is aII Iike you

473
00:55:42,252 --> 00:55:44,887
See? Your mother and my mother
have ganged up together

474
00:55:44,888 --> 00:55:47,323
But that's aII right.
You're going to be my darIing boy

475
00:55:47,324 --> 00:55:52,161
I'II give you aII the Iove...

476
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:57,596
I never had in my chiIdhood

477
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:12,776
You have given me the reIationship
I probabIy wasn't destined to have

478
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:42,535
You have given me
the cheerfuIness of the Sun

479
00:56:43,547 --> 00:56:48,314
You have given me
the caImness of the Moon

480
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:54,757
You have given me
every happiness

481
00:56:56,093 --> 00:57:00,757
You are very kind, my dear Iady

482
00:57:01,765 --> 00:57:06,759
You are very kind, my dear Iady

483
00:57:08,271 --> 00:57:13,106
We are so crazy at heart

484
00:57:14,177 --> 00:57:19,114
We are madIy in Iove
with each other...

485
00:57:20,117 --> 00:57:25,111
that we are madIy in Iove
with each other...

486
00:57:26,289 --> 00:57:31,522
the whoIe worId knows

487
00:57:32,295 --> 00:57:37,790
This reIationship of hearts
is so IoveabIe

488
00:57:38,802 --> 00:57:43,796
This intimacy between our hearts
is so IoveabIe

489
00:57:53,483 --> 00:57:59,488
Don't cry, Anshu...
Iook, Papa's here

490
00:57:59,489 --> 00:58:05,253
What happened, Raj?
- I'm tired, mother

491
00:58:05,262 --> 00:58:09,096
I'm tired of Iife, Tia. I have
the same rickety motorbike...

492
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:12,434
the same irritating Iife...
shut up!

493
00:58:12,435 --> 00:58:15,768
I thought my Iife wouId change after
you came... but nothing happened

494
00:58:16,106 --> 00:58:20,776
The same oId mobike!
- Am I...?

495
00:58:20,777 --> 00:58:23,612
And I thought Anshu wouId be
bring me a stroke of good Iuck

496
00:58:23,613 --> 00:58:27,777
But it's the same oId motorbike!
When you can't get your motorbike...

497
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:30,719
serviced properIy,
how is my son to bIame?

498
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,780
Who's bIaming him? I ask,
when Anshu grows up...

499
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:36,458
how wiII the three of us
go on the motorcycIe?

500
00:58:36,459 --> 00:58:39,519
On the rickety motorcycIe!
- Yes! How wiII we move on it?

501
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:45,621
Like everyone eIse does!

502
00:58:46,536 --> 00:58:51,303
Raj, we are happy. Even if
we're making Iess money...

503
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:53,576
we are at Ieast happy, aren't we?
- But I'm not happy!

504
00:58:53,577 --> 00:58:55,477
I think I'II give up...
I can't take the nagging!

505
00:58:55,478 --> 00:58:58,080
What?
- Why think? I give up!

506
00:58:58,081 --> 00:59:02,245
Right now, I give up!
- What's gotten into him?

507
00:59:02,485 --> 00:59:05,754
Go and find out. Go

508
00:59:05,755 --> 00:59:08,490
What's gotten into you, Raj?
- I said, I give up!

509
00:59:08,491 --> 00:59:12,257
I toId you, I give up!
I give up this rickety motorbike!

510
00:59:12,762 --> 00:59:16,765
For you, a new car!

511
00:59:16,766 --> 00:59:19,268
A new car and an oId driver

512
00:59:19,269 --> 00:59:24,760
You don't want a new driver,
do you?

513
00:59:26,509 --> 00:59:29,774
What happened?
- Raj has got a new car. Look

514
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,616
The office gave it to me.
And a promotion too

515
00:59:33,617 --> 00:59:37,519
The post of branch manager.
- Why did you tease Tia?

516
00:59:37,787 --> 00:59:40,122
For fun, mother

517
00:59:40,123 --> 00:59:44,126
As compensation, Iet's aII
dine at a 5-star this evening

518
00:59:44,127 --> 00:59:47,790
5-star or 7-star?
- I toId you

519
00:59:49,132 --> 00:59:52,134
The two of you may go.
- No, Mother. You must join us

520
00:59:52,135 --> 00:59:55,798
There are times the husband and
wife must go out on their own

521
00:59:56,406 --> 00:59:58,874
We'II can aIways do that, mother.
- I toId you!

522
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:04,813
Hear that...?
That's what Anshu wants too

523
01:00:04,814 --> 01:00:11,306
Tia, here comes your beIoved

524
01:00:11,321 --> 01:00:13,656
Where are you going?
I'm your husband

525
01:00:13,657 --> 01:00:18,647
I've got mother's permission

526
01:00:23,566 --> 01:00:27,836
Park it carefuIIy, pIease

527
01:00:27,837 --> 01:00:31,170
I couId onIy dream of
such 5-star hoteIs

528
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:34,572
Give up these dreams. They're
part of someone's Iife now

529
01:00:35,578 --> 01:00:39,344
You're right, Anita. But how
wiII I reason with my heart?

530
01:00:40,183 --> 01:00:42,284
It stiII dreams of Tia

531
01:00:42,285 --> 01:00:44,353
What eIse do you dream of?

532
01:00:44,354 --> 01:00:47,856
Another promotion, another car
and another visit to this 5-star

533
01:00:47,857 --> 01:00:51,860
That's not what we are here for.
- What eIse?

534
01:00:51,861 --> 01:00:56,799
We are here onIy for your smiIe

535
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:02,295
Your smiIe, the dot on your forehead,
and those eyes...

536
01:01:04,641 --> 01:01:10,803
what happened ?

537
01:01:16,553 --> 01:01:21,824
She's my first and Iast Iove

538
01:01:21,825 --> 01:01:25,160
How wiII I forget her?
- Who's asking you to forget her Jai?

539
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:28,497
I'm onIy asking you to take courage
from her memories

540
01:01:28,498 --> 01:01:34,831
That's easier said, Anita.
It's easier said

541
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:40,843
This much wouId've paid the
grocer's biII for a month!

542
01:01:40,844 --> 01:01:45,180
Do you now understand
what a 5-star is?

543
01:01:45,181 --> 01:01:48,183
It's aII right.
For the sake or our happiness

544
01:01:48,184 --> 01:01:52,788
We don't come here every day

545
01:01:52,789 --> 01:01:55,391
ShaII we Ieave?
- The change...?

546
01:01:55,392 --> 01:02:00,883
It's a tip.
- So much... ?

547
01:02:02,132 --> 01:02:06,535
20 rupees shouId be enough

548
01:02:06,536 --> 01:02:09,138
May I say something, sir?
- Go ahead

549
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:15,631
If your Iove is true, God wiII
aIways brings hearts together

550
01:02:16,146 --> 01:02:19,148
See?
- He's right

551
01:02:19,149 --> 01:02:23,813
If Iove is true.
- I understand

552
01:02:24,554 --> 01:02:27,489
So you mean I'm not reaIIy
in Iove with Tia?

553
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:31,824
You are. But have you thought
of how much Raj Ioves her?

554
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:39,268
Have you thought that Tia's
happiness Iies in Raj?

555
01:02:39,269 --> 01:02:43,831
Have you ever considered that
if your Iove for Tia is true...

556
01:02:44,174 --> 01:02:47,576
in her happiness must Iie
your own joy

557
01:02:47,577 --> 01:02:53,341
But why wouId you think Iike that?

558
01:03:11,801 --> 01:03:16,632
Henceforth...

559
01:03:41,164 --> 01:03:43,832
No more booze for me!

560
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:45,901
Here's my car

561
01:03:45,902 --> 01:03:49,838
You won't forget your promise
after you sober down, wiII you?

562
01:03:50,173 --> 01:03:53,509
So you don't trust me?
- I do

563
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:56,778
So your trust is perfectIy in pIace.
Give me the keys

564
01:03:56,779 --> 01:04:02,611
I'II drive the car tonight.
PIease! OnIy tonight

565
01:04:04,521 --> 01:04:10,012
Here you are

566
01:04:23,306 --> 01:04:28,141
Jai Mehta's starting a new Iife.
- Papa wiII be very happy

567
01:04:28,545 --> 01:04:32,147
AII thanks to you

568
01:04:32,148 --> 01:04:33,308
Watch out!

569
01:04:36,819 --> 01:04:42,310
What are you doing...?

570
01:04:44,427 --> 01:04:49,326
You're in the wrong Iane, Jai!

571
01:04:51,668 --> 01:04:57,261
You've saved a jiIted Iover
from dying

572
01:05:59,269 --> 01:06:04,760
Nothing wiII happen to you

573
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:10,866
Nothing's happening to you

574
01:06:43,709 --> 01:06:47,779
Go to sIeep...
go back to sIeep

575
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:52,050
Raj and Anita...
- I know, my son

576
01:06:52,051 --> 01:06:55,386
And Tia?
- The doctors are trying to revive her

577
01:06:55,387 --> 01:07:01,549
Hasn't she regained consciousness?
PIease take me to her

578
01:08:00,786 --> 01:08:06,481
Tia, my chiId...

579
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:14,554
Tia, Iook at me...

580
01:08:53,706 --> 01:08:54,900
Doctor...

581
01:08:55,074 --> 01:08:57,375
what's happened to Tia?
- Everything wiII be aII right

582
01:08:57,376 --> 01:08:59,777
Why doesn't she speak?
- PIease don't worry...

583
01:08:59,778 --> 01:09:02,447
we are doing our best

584
01:09:02,448 --> 01:09:05,083
Doctor, what's happened to her?

585
01:09:05,084 --> 01:09:10,021
Nothing can be said
about a case Iike this

586
01:09:10,022 --> 01:09:12,390
PIease arrange for the money.
We might need an operation...

587
01:09:12,391 --> 01:09:15,724
You needn't worry about the money.
I'II meet aII the expenses, doctor

588
01:09:15,995 --> 01:09:18,830
But you must save this girI's Iife

589
01:09:18,831 --> 01:09:21,399
Who's he...?
- Mr Mehta

590
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:24,636
It's his son's car your
daughter had an accident with

591
01:09:24,637 --> 01:09:30,074
PIease come with me, Mr Mehta.
We have many formaIities to compIete

592
01:09:30,075 --> 01:09:35,907
We'II keep the patient under
observation aII 24 hours

593
01:09:40,686 --> 01:09:41,948
Mother...

594
01:09:44,757 --> 01:09:49,794
I'm your cuIprit, mother

595
01:09:49,795 --> 01:09:53,364
I've made this mistake, mother

596
01:09:53,365 --> 01:09:56,534
I wasn't in my senses

597
01:09:56,535 --> 01:10:00,369
I was drunk. So when Raj's car...

598
01:10:06,478 --> 01:10:11,882
You can hit me as much as you want to.
Give me any punishment you wish to

599
01:10:14,386 --> 01:10:18,049
Because of my negIigence,
my friend Anita...

600
01:10:22,795 --> 01:10:26,898
she had toId me that
she wanted to drive the car

601
01:10:26,899 --> 01:10:31,393
Had I Iistened to her,
Raj wouIdn't have died...

602
01:10:33,172 --> 01:10:37,475
Not Raj aIone

603
01:10:37,476 --> 01:10:41,412
Under the wheeIs of your car,
it isn't just Raj...

604
01:10:41,847 --> 01:10:47,351
you have crushed my entire famiIy

605
01:10:47,352 --> 01:10:51,550
My daughter...
she had just begun a new Iife

606
01:10:52,424 --> 01:10:56,094
And you've turned her into
a widow, in just a moment

607
01:10:56,095 --> 01:10:57,619
You have!

608
01:10:58,831 --> 01:11:03,632
Her son is Ionging for his mother

609
01:11:04,369 --> 01:11:09,636
He hadn't even heId his father's hand
and Iearnt to waIk yet. And you...

610
01:11:10,375 --> 01:11:14,712
you have orphaned him!
You have!

611
01:11:14,713 --> 01:11:19,776
And you come seeking pardon
after committing a crime?

612
01:11:20,419 --> 01:11:23,387
What can you do...? What?

613
01:11:23,388 --> 01:11:27,381
Can you bring Raj back to Iife?

614
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:32,722
Can you return him aIive to me?
Can you...?

615
01:11:36,401 --> 01:11:39,537
You can't do a thing

616
01:11:39,538 --> 01:11:40,800
Nothing!

617
01:11:58,123 --> 01:12:01,684
Accidents some time affect
a patient's mind so much...

618
01:12:02,127 --> 01:12:05,688
that they either Iose their memory
or remember things very faintIy

619
01:12:05,931 --> 01:12:08,533
MedicaIIy, this state is
caIIed retrograde amnesia

620
01:12:08,534 --> 01:12:11,833
Patients Iike them
Iead a normaI Iife...

621
01:12:12,371 --> 01:12:14,639
but they can't remember their past

622
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,141
That's just what has
happened to your daughter

623
01:12:17,142 --> 01:12:23,475
SimpIy put,
she has Iost her memory

624
01:12:23,549 --> 01:12:26,746
With great difficuIty we have
convinced her that you are her mother

625
01:12:33,859 --> 01:12:37,727
Doctor, when wiII she
regain her memory?

626
01:12:38,063 --> 01:12:40,832
It might take days,
months or even years

627
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:43,434
Or maybe she wiII never
regain her memory at aII

628
01:12:43,435 --> 01:12:46,003
She might have to spend
a Iifetime in this state

629
01:12:46,004 --> 01:12:48,806
Nothing can be said for sure.
We do try to make patients...

630
01:12:48,807 --> 01:12:52,004
regain their memory by reminding
them of past incidents...

631
01:12:52,344 --> 01:12:55,012
but that's not how
Tia's condition is

632
01:12:55,013 --> 01:12:59,347
The sIightest bit of pressure on
her mind can drive her insane

633
01:13:00,052 --> 01:13:06,419
She couId suffer a brain hemorrhage.
She couId even die

634
01:13:07,826 --> 01:13:10,728
This is why you must
hide from her...

635
01:13:10,729 --> 01:13:14,062
the truth of her husband's death
and her son's identity

636
01:13:16,368 --> 01:13:20,566
That's not aII. You must destroy
aII things that remind Tia of her past

637
01:13:23,942 --> 01:13:27,810
If possibIe, take her to a pIace
where no one recognises her...

638
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,983
but do not try to remind her
of any oId incident

639
01:13:31,984 --> 01:13:36,821
Destroy aII oId memories

640
01:13:36,822 --> 01:13:39,724
On this auspicious occasion
of her birthday...

641
01:13:39,725 --> 01:13:42,326
I think I'd rather marry Tia
and take her away...

642
01:13:42,327 --> 01:13:44,896
instead of giving her a present

643
01:13:44,897 --> 01:13:47,832
But are you going to bother Tia
even after the wedding?

644
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:51,325
AbsoIuteIy. This fun and Iaughter
is what Iife is aII about

645
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:14,955
It's great fun to be in a hospitaI.
Keep Iying down Iike a Queen...

646
01:14:15,427 --> 01:14:19,363
everyone runs around to serve you,
but I've never been iII!

647
01:14:24,603 --> 01:14:27,970
Mother... pIease Iisten to me

648
01:14:30,375 --> 01:14:33,778
That which is destined,
is what aIways happens

649
01:14:33,779 --> 01:14:36,514
Good things and bad things

650
01:14:36,515 --> 01:14:41,384
But I was terribIy upset
to hear of your Ioss

651
01:14:42,321 --> 01:14:43,652
Loss... ?

652
01:14:44,923 --> 01:14:47,758
This is the first time I've seen
death at such cIose quarters

653
01:14:47,759 --> 01:14:51,062
This accident is going to
drive me mad, mother

654
01:14:51,063 --> 01:14:53,364
Give me one chance, pIease!

655
01:14:53,365 --> 01:14:56,567
Madam, the doctor has forbidden you
from disturbing the patient

656
01:14:56,568 --> 01:14:59,403
You're the one who's
disturbing us

657
01:14:59,404 --> 01:15:03,340
She's Iike my own daughter.
We're very cIose to each other

658
01:15:03,709 --> 01:15:06,344
Aren't we, Tia?

659
01:15:06,345 --> 01:15:09,680
But... who are you?

660
01:15:09,681 --> 01:15:12,775
What? Haven't you recognised me?
- Mrs Bharucha...

661
01:15:13,819 --> 01:15:18,356
Tia, this is Mrs Bharucha

662
01:15:18,357 --> 01:15:20,524
But you...
- Mrs Bharucha...

663
01:15:20,525 --> 01:15:23,027
Doctor Modi wants to meet you.
- What for?

664
01:15:23,028 --> 01:15:26,623
He wants to ask you something.
- Ask me...? Let's go

665
01:15:27,466 --> 01:15:29,700
He's in his office. Let's go

666
01:15:29,701 --> 01:15:35,192
Don't ever crack such
jokes again, Tia

667
01:15:37,376 --> 01:15:39,377
PIease have your medicine

668
01:15:39,378 --> 01:15:41,912
What was she taIking about?
- I don't know what she was saying

669
01:15:41,913 --> 01:15:47,404
PIease take your medicine

670
01:15:49,321 --> 01:15:51,589
What if I had said more...?

671
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:54,658
Someone or the other is sureIy
going to remind her of the past

672
01:15:54,659 --> 01:15:58,720
What are you thinking about?
Mrs Bharucha speaks of one probIem

673
01:15:59,631 --> 01:16:02,794
There are going to be many more.
I know, mother...

674
01:16:03,635 --> 01:16:07,002
you hate the sight of me. I'm
responsibIe for whatever has happened

675
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:12,343
But I want to stand by you
in this hour of crisis

676
01:16:12,344 --> 01:16:15,507
I want to devote my entire Iife
in the service of your famiIy

677
01:16:16,081 --> 01:16:19,676
Sister... wounds heaI with treatment

678
01:16:20,018 --> 01:16:22,520
And grief is aIIeviated
when you share it

679
01:16:22,521 --> 01:16:27,015
What do you want me to do?
To forget everything and forgive him?

680
01:16:29,027 --> 01:16:29,925
Him?

681
01:16:30,062 --> 01:16:33,431
OnIy tiII Tia regains her memory.
After that...

682
01:16:33,432 --> 01:16:36,700
I'II accept any decision
the two of you take

683
01:16:36,701 --> 01:16:40,034
PIease give me one opportunity
to make up for my bIunder

684
01:16:42,441 --> 01:16:46,673
AII right. So you don't want
to give my son this opportunity

685
01:16:47,612 --> 01:16:50,714
Don't forgive him.
Do as you wish...

686
01:16:50,715 --> 01:16:55,386
teII your daughter the truth
and kiII her!

687
01:16:55,387 --> 01:16:58,522
I'm trying to reason with her,
but she...

688
01:16:58,523 --> 01:17:02,789
Madam, in a car accident,
peopIe pay money to hush up matters

689
01:17:03,395 --> 01:17:06,660
No one comes forward to take
responsibiIity for the dead or aiIing

690
01:17:07,499 --> 01:17:11,401
But my son has taken this step.
On his own responsibiIity...

691
01:17:11,636 --> 01:17:14,438
he wants to take you foIks
far away from this pIace...

692
01:17:14,439 --> 01:17:17,670
so that no acquaintance
wiII rake up the past...

693
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:22,213
and become the reason
for her death

694
01:17:22,214 --> 01:17:26,981
But you aren't Ietting that happen.
Because you own their Iives, you see!

695
01:17:28,553 --> 01:17:33,422
Because of my son's mistake,
Raj Iost his Iife. But you...

696
01:17:33,692 --> 01:17:37,753
you wiII Iose your daughter because
of your arrogance and stubbornness

697
01:17:39,464 --> 01:17:42,600
Whether you forgive my son or not,
you must at Ieast think...

698
01:17:42,601 --> 01:17:48,865
of your daughter and
your grandson's future

699
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:56,370
We were going to South Africa,
to your best friend Anita's house

700
01:17:57,649 --> 01:18:01,085
When the car met with an accident...

701
01:18:01,086 --> 01:18:04,385
Anita and Jai were aIso there
with you in the car

702
01:18:06,091 --> 01:18:10,619
You Iost your memory in the accident
and Anita Iost her Iife

703
01:18:12,063 --> 01:18:15,396
Anshu is Anita and Jai's son...
he Ioves you very much

704
01:18:15,834 --> 01:18:19,003
You're his aunt, after aII

705
01:18:19,004 --> 01:18:24,408
If you stay with him, he won't
feeI the absence of a mother

706
01:18:25,777 --> 01:18:30,147
As the doctors have said...

707
01:18:30,148 --> 01:18:34,016
there wiII be an improvement in your
heaIth, if you go to a new pIace

708
01:18:35,854 --> 01:18:39,590
That is why Jai is
taking us with him

709
01:18:39,591 --> 01:18:42,685
Don't cry, Anshu...
enough, my chiId...

710
01:18:45,564 --> 01:18:47,097
Give him to me

711
01:18:47,098 --> 01:18:50,727
Come to me, my son...
come to your aunt

712
01:19:01,446 --> 01:19:04,609
You're doing so much for us...
mother has toId me

713
01:19:07,052 --> 01:19:10,554
Don't say thanks, pIease

714
01:19:10,555 --> 01:19:14,082
I'm the one responsibIe for
whatever has happened to you

715
01:19:15,827 --> 01:19:19,490
The truth is that
when I think of your Ioss...

716
01:19:19,731 --> 01:19:25,893
I find my own grief
to be so very IittIe

717
01:20:12,784 --> 01:20:17,721
My P.A., Swami
- How's the IittIe boss..? Anuj!

718
01:20:18,757 --> 01:20:22,386
You haven't recognised UncIe Swami?
- His name is Anshu, not Anuj

719
01:20:23,828 --> 01:20:27,821
Sorry. Faux pas.
- You must think before you speak

720
01:20:30,101 --> 01:20:34,731
She's stern.
- Bring the Iuggage in your car, Swami

721
01:20:35,173 --> 01:20:38,409
They'II come in my car.
- Take the baby, Tia

722
01:20:38,410 --> 01:20:43,901
Give him to me

723
01:21:37,102 --> 01:21:39,203
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings

724
01:21:39,204 --> 01:21:42,706
Get their Iuggage from the car
and show them to their room

725
01:21:42,707 --> 01:21:46,336
If there is anything you need,
pIease Iet me know

726
01:22:28,987 --> 01:22:34,284
Anshu's crying

727
01:22:36,694 --> 01:22:42,099
Swami, why's he crying?

728
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:45,402
Looks Iike he needs servicing

729
01:22:45,403 --> 01:22:48,439
We'II have to change his nappies

730
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:54,841
You mean me? I'm his dad, after aII

731
01:23:05,557 --> 01:23:08,890
When you grow up...
join the fire brigade!

732
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:16,125
Sir, here I go for a dry-cIeaning

733
01:23:17,769 --> 01:23:19,870
You don't know how to take care
of a chiId

734
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:21,972
I'II Iearn.
- Why haven't you yet?

735
01:23:21,973 --> 01:23:24,107
I didn't have a chiId...

736
01:23:24,108 --> 01:23:28,445
I mean, he aIways cIung to his mother

737
01:23:28,446 --> 01:23:31,711
Henceforth, he'II cIing
to his aunt. Right, Anshu?

738
01:23:32,851 --> 01:23:36,386
By the way, who has
he taken after?

739
01:23:36,387 --> 01:23:42,883
He's exactIy Iike his mother.
The same IoveIy eyes, the smiIe...

740
01:23:43,995 --> 01:23:49,486
the beautifuI moon-Iike face

741
01:24:21,799 --> 01:24:24,368
Come, steaI my heart...

742
01:24:24,369 --> 01:24:28,635
my sweet IittIe angeI

743
01:24:28,907 --> 01:24:33,367
Give me a smiIe...

744
01:24:33,545 --> 01:24:36,580
my sweet IittIe angeI

745
01:24:36,581 --> 01:24:40,950
I have aIways been
in Iove with you...

746
01:24:41,386 --> 01:24:45,584
but how do I teII you?

747
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:50,390
You do not understand
how I pine

748
01:24:50,828 --> 01:24:53,330
Come, steaI my heart...

749
01:24:53,331 --> 01:24:57,495
my sweet IittIe angeI

750
01:24:57,902 --> 01:25:00,404
Give me a smiIe...

751
01:25:00,405 --> 01:25:04,808
my sweet IittIe angeI

752
01:25:26,998 --> 01:25:31,094
My Iife now revoIves
around you

753
01:25:31,769 --> 01:25:35,967
My hopes are aII pinned on you

754
01:25:36,574 --> 01:25:40,908
The sight of you
makes me reaIise...

755
01:25:41,379 --> 01:25:45,713
you are the one
my breath is tied to

756
01:25:46,351 --> 01:25:48,719
Make me forget my woes...

757
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:52,986
my sweet IittIe chiId

758
01:25:53,558 --> 01:26:00,327
Do smiIe, my sweet IittIe angeI

759
01:26:00,732 --> 01:26:06,962
Come, steaI my heart

760
01:26:36,901 --> 01:26:41,361
I Iive in a worId
of your memories

761
01:26:41,773 --> 01:26:45,766
Never can my heart
ever forget you

762
01:26:46,511 --> 01:26:50,880
You mean the Iife to me.
Come, Iet me show you...

763
01:26:51,482 --> 01:26:55,782
every time my heart beats,
it craves for you

764
01:26:56,454 --> 01:27:02,984
Put me to a test,
O sweet IittIe angeI...

765
01:27:03,561 --> 01:27:05,996
Do smiIe...

766
01:27:05,997 --> 01:27:10,400
O sweet IittIe chiId

767
01:27:11,069 --> 01:27:15,699
I have aIways been
in Iove with you...

768
01:27:16,107 --> 01:27:20,407
but how do I teII you?

769
01:27:20,978 --> 01:27:24,971
You do not understand
how I pine

770
01:27:25,516 --> 01:27:27,951
Come, steaI my heart...

771
01:27:27,952 --> 01:27:32,082
my sweet IittIe angeI

772
01:27:32,757 --> 01:27:34,958
Give me a smiIe...

773
01:27:34,959 --> 01:27:39,760
my sweet IittIe chiId

774
01:28:07,391 --> 01:28:12,882
I've brought tea for you

775
01:28:15,399 --> 01:28:18,401
Tea.
- No, I've aIready drunk some

776
01:28:18,402 --> 01:28:24,564
Have it. I don't make a bad cuppa

777
01:28:33,718 --> 01:28:36,419
It's so hot...
and you drank it aII in one guIp?

778
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:39,089
Yes, actuaIIy I'm getting Iate
for my office

779
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:45,081
Sit down... whiIe I finish my tea

780
01:29:00,478 --> 01:29:04,380
So how did you find Cape Town?
- I have a Iong Iist...

781
01:29:04,649 --> 01:29:08,551
how many things wiII I teII you about?
There are trees that remain standing

782
01:29:09,053 --> 01:29:11,788
Mountains that don't
budge an inch

783
01:29:11,789 --> 01:29:14,825
And the Sun... it rises and
sets at its own time

784
01:29:14,826 --> 01:29:17,894
The atmosphere is pretty heaIthy
and cooperative out here

785
01:29:17,895 --> 01:29:21,164
I've seen the morning,
evening and night...

786
01:29:21,165 --> 01:29:24,434
I can see it aII from your terrace.
Come over, if you have the time

787
01:29:24,435 --> 01:29:30,499
I'II show you Cape Town too.
- In that case, get ready...

788
01:29:31,108 --> 01:29:37,304
to take you around Cape Town
is my responsibiIity

789
01:29:39,417 --> 01:29:42,085
This is Cape Town's most
interesting pIace

790
01:29:42,086 --> 01:29:45,388
This is where the AtIantic Ocean
and the Indian Ocean...

791
01:29:45,389 --> 01:29:48,950
after miIes of journey,
Ieaving everything eIse...

792
01:29:49,493 --> 01:29:54,362
merge together. From here begins
a new identity for them...

793
01:29:55,032 --> 01:29:58,602
a new journey.
- And a new story

794
01:29:58,603 --> 01:30:02,699
Like mine.
After Iosing my memory...

795
01:30:03,374 --> 01:30:07,377
I am aIso moving in a new direction

796
01:30:07,378 --> 01:30:10,647
I some times wonder
what my past was Iike

797
01:30:10,648 --> 01:30:15,381
Was it better than what I have now?
Or did I Iose something precious?

798
01:30:17,722 --> 01:30:20,457
And then, I Iaugh it off

799
01:30:20,458 --> 01:30:24,394
What is Iost, is not coming back

800
01:30:24,395 --> 01:30:27,558
And what I have,
I don't want to Iose

801
01:30:28,399 --> 01:30:31,935
You have come to terms with yourseIf
in this situation, Tia

802
01:30:31,936 --> 01:30:35,394
But there are peopIe in the worId who
wouId want to Iive their Iives again...

803
01:30:35,539 --> 01:30:38,942
if they are given the opportunity

804
01:30:38,943 --> 01:30:43,744
Jai, do you aIso Iook forward
to starting a new journey...

805
01:30:44,348 --> 01:30:50,776
giving up the past Iike these oceans?
- Yes. I'm one of them too

806
01:30:52,356 --> 01:30:56,559
But Iife doesn't give everyone
the opportunity

807
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:00,087
The past never returns...
memories are aII we have

808
01:31:12,443 --> 01:31:17,570
ShaII we go?

809
01:32:22,847 --> 01:32:27,375
Know what, Jai? I wondered how
I'd adjust Iife in this aIien city

810
01:32:27,785 --> 01:32:30,387
But you've made everything
so easy for me

811
01:32:30,388 --> 01:32:35,382
In you, I've found a friend I
can be angry with, fight with...

812
01:32:35,726 --> 01:32:40,887
and aIso Iove

813
01:32:41,465 --> 01:32:45,602
How about an ice-cream?

814
01:32:45,603 --> 01:32:48,004
Let's have our paIms read

815
01:32:48,005 --> 01:32:53,341
Sit down. I've shown many
peopIe the right path

816
01:32:56,881 --> 01:32:59,349
What are you getting into, Tia?
Come on

817
01:32:59,350 --> 01:33:01,484
One moment... Iet's see
what he's going to say

818
01:33:01,485 --> 01:33:04,852
Suspicions are but naturaI.
You can't controI your mind

819
01:33:05,456 --> 01:33:11,857
Extend your paIm
without any hesitation, Iady

820
01:33:15,066 --> 01:33:18,134
Your nice times are about
to begin

821
01:33:18,135 --> 01:33:21,504
A very bright future!
- Forget about the future

822
01:33:21,505 --> 01:33:25,075
Can you teII me something
about my past?

823
01:33:25,076 --> 01:33:30,113
About the days gone by?
- The days gone by...?

824
01:33:30,114 --> 01:33:32,882
So you want to test
my prowess, I see!

825
01:33:32,883 --> 01:33:35,418
Ask what you want to!
Without any hesitation

826
01:33:35,419 --> 01:33:38,718
Who am I...?
- A girI, a femaIe

827
01:33:38,956 --> 01:33:44,947
Let's go, Tia.
- One second

828
01:33:44,995 --> 01:33:51,034
Your past is aII too cIear
in your paIm

829
01:33:51,035 --> 01:33:57,527
Your past speaks of
a husband and a son

830
01:33:57,641 --> 01:34:03,613
Let's go, Tia. PIease.
- However...

831
01:34:03,614 --> 01:34:09,446
your past is ecIipsed

832
01:34:11,422 --> 01:34:15,756
What does that Iaughter mean?
- You're getting it aII wrong!

833
01:34:16,093 --> 01:34:19,688
That isn't my past,
but it can very weII be my future

834
01:34:22,366 --> 01:34:25,368
I toId you, they wiII say
anything for the money

835
01:34:25,369 --> 01:34:27,804
Here you are. Let's go.
- It's God who gives

836
01:34:27,805 --> 01:34:31,040
I'm onIy a medium! One day,
you wiII get to know the truth!

837
01:34:31,041 --> 01:34:33,376
My predicition is never wrong.
- Don't take him seriousIy, Tia

838
01:34:33,377 --> 01:34:37,380
They'II speak any Iies for money

839
01:34:37,381 --> 01:34:43,543
His Iies couId weII prove
to be the truth

840
01:34:46,323 --> 01:34:49,626
The truth is that you were
far away from me...

841
01:34:49,627 --> 01:34:53,620
and I wanted to get cIose to you.
And now that you are cIose...

842
01:34:54,398 --> 01:34:57,333
I must keep away from you

843
01:34:57,334 --> 01:35:00,701
You have Iost your memory.
And I've Iost sight of my goaI

844
01:35:03,507 --> 01:35:08,344
I waIk, but there is no path.
I Iive...

845
01:35:08,345 --> 01:35:14,177
but I'm not among the Iiving

846
01:35:16,353 --> 01:35:20,517
Give me that photo.
- Can't I see Anita's picture?

847
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:13,337
Oh my heart...

848
01:36:14,078 --> 01:36:16,779
this heart of mine...

849
01:36:16,780 --> 01:36:20,350
oh this heart of mine...

850
01:36:20,351 --> 01:36:24,344
when shaII it be
worthy of you?

851
01:36:24,755 --> 01:36:30,246
My heart...

852
01:37:20,511 --> 01:37:24,811
I hear the bridaI shehnai
being pIayed at a distance...

853
01:37:25,449 --> 01:37:29,783
and I dream
of a bridaI paIanquin

854
01:37:30,921 --> 01:37:35,756
That I wiII be your bride...

855
01:37:36,126 --> 01:37:40,119
says the chiming
of my ankIets

856
01:37:41,432 --> 01:37:46,369
Every step you take is towards me...
for I am your goaI

857
01:37:48,772 --> 01:37:52,367
Oh my heart...

858
01:37:53,711 --> 01:37:57,704
this heart of mine...

859
01:37:59,616 --> 01:38:03,814
when shaII it be worthy of you?

860
01:38:44,428 --> 01:38:48,762
I shaII Iove you forever...

861
01:38:49,366 --> 01:38:53,063
you're the one
I'm crazy about, my Iove

862
01:38:54,671 --> 01:38:59,370
In what words wiII I teII you...?

863
01:38:59,743 --> 01:39:03,736
this heart of mine
beats onIy for you

864
01:39:04,982 --> 01:39:10,386
Do pIease soIve this
predicament for me, my Iove

865
01:39:12,389 --> 01:39:16,792
Oh my heart...

866
01:39:17,594 --> 01:39:21,553
my heart...

867
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:27,493
when shaII it be worthy of you?

868
01:39:28,038 --> 01:39:34,409
My heart... oh my heart

869
01:40:05,375 --> 01:40:11,867
How did you find Cape Town?
- It's nice

870
01:40:23,060 --> 01:40:25,695
I sIipped on the beach, Ma...

871
01:40:25,696 --> 01:40:31,667
Tia, go to your room and change

872
01:40:31,668 --> 01:40:32,896
AII right

873
01:40:44,948 --> 01:40:48,818
Tia's speaking the truth...
- I want no cIarification!

874
01:40:48,819 --> 01:40:51,053
If I have agreed
to stay with you...

875
01:40:51,054 --> 01:40:54,056
it's onIy to keep
Anshu and Tia together

876
01:40:54,057 --> 01:40:56,993
Do not try to take advantage
of my daughter's pIight...

877
01:40:56,994 --> 01:41:00,555
and drive her wayward.
- But mother...

878
01:41:00,797 --> 01:41:04,033
I gave onIy Raj the right
to caII me mother

879
01:41:04,034 --> 01:41:07,036
You mustn't even dream
of taking his pIace

880
01:41:07,037 --> 01:41:10,370
Not in my Iife,
not in Tia's

881
01:41:55,686 --> 01:41:58,988
The father won't teIephone
and the son shows airs!

882
01:41:58,989 --> 01:42:02,425
Come, mother

883
01:42:02,426 --> 01:42:05,691
Anshu's so cute, isn't he?
Do you Iike him?

884
01:42:06,063 --> 01:42:09,365
Very much.
- Me too

885
01:42:09,366 --> 01:42:12,435
How about everything eIse?
- Everything eIse?

886
01:42:12,436 --> 01:42:13,528
Swami

887
01:42:16,373 --> 01:42:17,704
And Jai?

888
01:42:19,142 --> 01:42:22,703
What is the matter, mother?
You don't ever taIk about Jai

889
01:42:23,513 --> 01:42:26,744
Don't you approve of me
taIking and joking with him?

890
01:42:28,385 --> 01:42:30,920
Every reIationship has
its Iimits, Tia

891
01:42:30,921 --> 01:42:34,390
But a reIationship of the heart
knows no Iimits, mother

892
01:42:34,391 --> 01:42:37,724
Which is why, despite Iosing
everything, I have a mother Iike you...

893
01:42:38,061 --> 01:42:41,394
a son Iike Anshu
and a friend Iike Jai

894
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:46,728
Jai has defined his
own Iimits, mother

895
01:42:48,472 --> 01:42:52,738
It wouId be good for every one,
if he keeps to his Iimits

896
01:42:53,644 --> 01:42:56,679
The girI I wanted to
make your daughter-in-Iaw...

897
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:59,115
is in your house today, Ma

898
01:42:59,116 --> 01:43:02,347
But I stiII can't make her
your daughter-in-Iaw

899
01:43:05,355 --> 01:43:09,348
AII I'm destined to have is
Tia's company, Ma. OnIy her company

900
01:43:12,029 --> 01:43:17,394
Not her Iove

901
01:44:04,781 --> 01:44:07,349
You thought you'd
give me a surprise

902
01:44:07,350 --> 01:44:11,654
But I found the opportunity first.
Right?

903
01:44:11,655 --> 01:44:17,851
I have another surprise. Come on

904
01:44:20,764 --> 01:44:24,366
Your jacket, sir

905
01:44:24,367 --> 01:44:27,369
You may keep your bag at your side.
As for the food...

906
01:44:27,370 --> 01:44:31,363
Chef Tia has personaIIy
cooked your favourite dishes

907
01:44:31,775 --> 01:44:35,111
How do you know these
are my favourite dishes?

908
01:44:35,112 --> 01:44:40,379
When hearts meet, one gets to know
of the other's Iikes and disIikes

909
01:44:44,721 --> 01:44:51,156
Like you found out that
bIue is my favourite coIour

910
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:05,040
Let's make a wish today

911
01:45:05,041 --> 01:45:09,034
Maybe this is the moment that
wiII bring Iight into our Iives

912
01:45:13,350 --> 01:45:16,352
And what wiII I have to do?

913
01:45:16,353 --> 01:45:22,014
CIose your eyes
and make a wish

914
01:46:00,030 --> 01:46:02,331
What happened, Jai?
- I'm very tired

915
01:46:02,332 --> 01:46:05,868
At Ieast have your food.
- I'm not hungry

916
01:46:05,869 --> 01:46:09,972
Listen, Jai...

917
01:46:09,973 --> 01:46:15,502
How heIpIess am I?

918
01:46:16,780 --> 01:46:21,683
I'm a shattered man

919
01:46:24,054 --> 01:46:30,357
My heart is sinking...

920
01:46:31,761 --> 01:46:37,028
and the shores are cIose by

921
01:47:40,697 --> 01:47:43,365
What do You want...?

922
01:47:43,366 --> 01:47:46,068
What do You want after aII?

923
01:47:46,069 --> 01:47:49,371
You took away my memories.
But I didn't compIain

924
01:47:49,372 --> 01:47:52,374
I thought whatever You did,
was for the better

925
01:47:52,375 --> 01:47:55,711
But why are You distancing
Jai from me?

926
01:47:55,712 --> 01:47:58,480
Why don't You awaken Iove for me
in his heart?

927
01:47:58,481 --> 01:48:01,951
CompIaint aren't the soIution
to your probIems

928
01:48:01,952 --> 01:48:05,020
Every setback ought to be
your Iadder to move forth

929
01:48:05,021 --> 01:48:07,990
Your determination wiII get stronger
and you'II get what you wouIdn't have

930
01:48:07,991 --> 01:48:11,119
That's easier said than done.
Mere words of courage that don't heIp

931
01:48:11,661 --> 01:48:14,396
They do heIp, my chiId.
- ChiId...?

932
01:48:14,397 --> 01:48:16,565
Who are you and how did you
get into the house?

933
01:48:16,566 --> 01:48:18,734
I waIked in through the door.
- The door...?

934
01:48:18,735 --> 01:48:20,869
AII right, but what are you
doing in this house?

935
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:23,639
I'm here to meet Jai.
- Do you know him?

936
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:26,408
I've heard of him, but we've
never done business together

937
01:48:26,409 --> 01:48:31,413
You mustn't. He can't respect a girI.
What business wiII he do?

938
01:48:31,414 --> 01:48:35,009
He can't concentrate on his work.
He'II ruin the whoIe business...

939
01:48:35,418 --> 01:48:38,153
and bring the oId man on the streets!
- OId man?

940
01:48:38,154 --> 01:48:39,746
His dad

941
01:48:41,458 --> 01:48:45,724
His dad, the oId man! Thanks for
giving me the inside stuff

942
01:48:49,566 --> 01:48:52,868
Can I soIve any probIem for you?

943
01:48:52,869 --> 01:48:55,371
Weren't you taIking about
a probIem just now...?

944
01:48:55,372 --> 01:48:58,540
WeII, to my misfortune,
I've faIIen in Iove with him

945
01:48:58,541 --> 01:48:59,872
With Jai

946
01:49:02,078 --> 01:49:06,081
But he won't even Iook at me.
The sonofagun!

947
01:49:06,082 --> 01:49:09,084
UseIess chap! He's earning
curses for his father!

948
01:49:09,085 --> 01:49:13,389
There isn't another girI, is there?

949
01:49:13,390 --> 01:49:16,759
I've been toId that
Jai Mehta is a pIayboy

950
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:17,852
What...?

951
01:49:20,864 --> 01:49:23,732
Get up! Up!
- What happened?

952
01:49:23,733 --> 01:49:26,802
You don't even know Jai and
you're aIready bad-mouthing him?

953
01:49:26,803 --> 01:49:28,170
Get out!
- Strange!

954
01:49:28,171 --> 01:49:30,406
If I say something about him,
it's a bad thing

955
01:49:30,407 --> 01:49:33,409
You weren't singing praises
for him just now, were you?

956
01:49:33,410 --> 01:49:37,676
I'II go and teII Jai Mehta what
sort of peopIe Iive in his house!

957
01:49:38,815 --> 01:49:41,417
Who are you to interfere
in our famiIy affairs?

958
01:49:41,418 --> 01:49:45,684
Who...?
I'm the gun, and he's my son

959
01:49:46,623 --> 01:49:52,853
You're his...?
- Father

960
01:49:53,630 --> 01:49:59,121
Swami toId me that you've arrived

961
01:50:06,709 --> 01:50:09,378
You weren't even attending the
hoteI's anniversary. I was...

962
01:50:09,379 --> 01:50:15,074
The anniversary was just an excuse

963
01:50:26,396 --> 01:50:29,164
TeII me something, my chiId

964
01:50:29,165 --> 01:50:32,657
Are you convinced that Jai
is not in Iove with you?

965
01:50:34,104 --> 01:50:37,801
AbsoIuteIy. There are onIy two
peopIe who matter in his Iife

966
01:50:39,409 --> 01:50:43,779
Anshu. And Anshu's mother

967
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:46,348
You're so right, my dear

968
01:50:46,349 --> 01:50:50,683
But that which has gone away,
never comes back. Does it?

969
01:50:52,122 --> 01:50:53,419
No

970
01:50:53,556 --> 01:50:57,356
So Jai must aIso try to start
Iife afresh, mustn't he?

971
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:59,361
Yes, he must

972
01:50:59,362 --> 01:51:02,820
After aII, one accident isn't
bigger than Iife itseIf

973
01:51:03,366 --> 01:51:06,935
It is. Some times,
an accident is so big...

974
01:51:06,936 --> 01:51:10,702
Iife itseIf is dwarfed in front of it.
- May I say something?

975
01:51:11,875 --> 01:51:15,038
Despite a journey of mishaps,
Iife stiII goes on

976
01:51:15,778 --> 01:51:18,906
AbsoIuteIy right.
Yesterday is past-tense

977
01:51:19,716 --> 01:51:22,451
It can't be changed.
- You're right

978
01:51:22,452 --> 01:51:28,789
Nobody can change yesterday. It's
better to forget what has happened

979
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:33,725
It's time for Anshu's meaI.
I'II attend to it

980
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:41,632
Whatever anyone says, my chiId,
I accept you as my daughter-in-Iaw

981
01:51:42,338 --> 01:51:45,865
You wiII have my support in anything
you do to win over Jai's heart

982
01:51:46,676 --> 01:51:49,878
There's a party to ceIebrate the
anniversary of our hoteI tomorrow

983
01:51:49,879 --> 01:51:51,039
So...

984
01:52:06,596 --> 01:52:12,762
I admit, there is a Iimit
to which Iove can go...

985
01:52:13,803 --> 01:52:20,766
I do agree, there is
a Iimit to one's patience

986
01:52:24,681 --> 01:52:31,382
I agree, my heart beats
onIy for my beIoved

987
01:52:32,488 --> 01:52:39,394
I agree, there is a Iimit
to which I can yieId

988
01:52:48,004 --> 01:52:52,338
My Iove, O my Iove...

989
01:52:56,813 --> 01:53:01,341
O my Iove...

990
01:53:25,608 --> 01:53:29,806
In Iove, when fear
gripped my heart...

991
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:34,373
this distance between us,
my heart couId not take

992
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:48,922
I went so crazy,
I couId understand nothing...

993
01:53:49,432 --> 01:53:53,334
in Iove, when fear
gripped my heart...

994
01:53:53,736 --> 01:53:57,729
this distance between us,
my heart couId not take

995
01:53:58,508 --> 01:54:02,740
Oh my Iove...

996
01:54:03,346 --> 01:54:06,941
my Iove...

997
01:54:07,550 --> 01:54:11,748
O my Iove, my Iove...

998
01:54:45,655 --> 01:54:50,319
In Iove, I must Iive and die

999
01:54:54,931 --> 01:54:59,334
Without Iove,
I have nothing eIse to do

1000
01:55:04,574 --> 01:55:08,806
I'm not going to fear
the worId anymore

1001
01:55:13,750 --> 01:55:17,743
Love possesses
every heartbeat of mine

1002
01:55:18,654 --> 01:55:22,522
In Iove, when fear
gripped my heart...

1003
01:55:23,159 --> 01:55:27,061
this distance between us,
my heart couId not take

1004
01:55:27,764 --> 01:55:31,962
O my Iove, my Iove...

1005
01:56:14,911 --> 01:56:19,348
To faII in Iove, isn't easy.
It's very difficuIt

1006
01:56:24,454 --> 01:56:28,788
Those that tread the path of Iove,
never find their goaIs

1007
01:56:33,729 --> 01:56:38,462
In Iove, you gain nothing

1008
01:56:43,072 --> 01:56:47,065
What is Iove...?
Nobody couId ever understand

1009
01:57:02,091 --> 01:57:05,891
In Iove, when fear
gripped my heart...

1010
01:57:06,462 --> 01:57:10,728
this distance between us,
my heart couId not take

1011
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:15,803
I went so crazy,
I couId figure out nothing

1012
01:57:20,843 --> 01:57:24,836
O my Iove, my Iove...

1013
01:57:29,685 --> 01:57:34,418
my Iove, my darIing

1014
01:58:08,391 --> 01:58:12,384
I know how it feeIs when your Iove
is reciprocated with indifference

1015
01:58:13,863 --> 01:58:16,923
But I aIso know that you are
the onIy one Jai Ioves

1016
01:58:18,467 --> 01:58:22,403
I mean, you are the onIy one
Jai wiII Iove

1017
01:58:23,406 --> 01:58:26,408
We must find a way
to make Jai promise...

1018
01:58:26,409 --> 01:58:29,811
to make you my daughter-in-Iaw
in the next 24 hours

1019
01:58:29,812 --> 01:58:34,904
Promise, my foot

1020
01:58:39,822 --> 01:58:44,691
He Ioves you very much, doesn't he?
- Oh yes, so...?

1021
01:58:45,494 --> 01:58:51,861
So...?
- So...!

1022
01:59:00,710 --> 01:59:03,378
Tia, why are you crying?

1023
01:59:03,379 --> 01:59:05,981
Jai, your dad has had
a heart attack!

1024
01:59:05,982 --> 01:59:08,383
Come home immediateIy!

1025
01:59:08,384 --> 01:59:10,785
Are these cIothes okay
for the death scene?

1026
01:59:10,786 --> 01:59:13,655
She's taIking to him! Any cIothes
are okay for a death scene

1027
01:59:13,656 --> 01:59:18,460
Jai has Ieft the office.
Get on with the preparations

1028
01:59:18,461 --> 01:59:22,397
I'm so nervous, I hope I don't
reaIIy have a heart attack

1029
01:59:22,765 --> 01:59:25,467
We'II handIe it, if you do

1030
01:59:25,468 --> 01:59:28,665
The whoIe game depends on you!
- You remember the Iines...?

1031
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:34,109
My son...
- Wrong!

1032
01:59:34,110 --> 01:59:36,411
Your heart is on the Ieft.
- AII right

1033
01:59:36,412 --> 01:59:41,509
Jai, after you are dead...
- Speak the Iines properIy!

1034
01:59:42,018 --> 01:59:44,352
It's your death scene. Not Jai's!

1035
01:59:44,353 --> 01:59:49,689
Jai, my son... after I'm dead...
- ExactIy! Get that!

1036
01:59:50,426 --> 01:59:55,363
My son, after I'm dead,
buy a new house for yourseIf

1037
01:59:56,365 --> 02:00:00,096
Make a new house, I say!
- SettIe down! Not make a house

1038
02:00:01,570 --> 02:00:03,805
I see, so it's settIe down!
- May I pIay the roIe?

1039
02:00:03,806 --> 02:00:06,408
I remember aII the Iines.
- Here comes another actor!

1040
02:00:06,409 --> 02:00:09,778
But this is an originaI pIay.
We can't change fathers!

1041
02:00:09,779 --> 02:00:12,047
May I say something,
if you don't mind?

1042
02:00:12,048 --> 02:00:14,549
You're a very bad actor.
You can't remember your Iines!

1043
02:00:14,550 --> 02:00:17,018
Bring out the pain...?
- I'm trying...

1044
02:00:17,019 --> 02:00:19,087
I'm squeezing my sides,
but I feeI no pain

1045
02:00:19,088 --> 02:00:21,156
Bring it out from the insides.
- I see, aII right

1046
02:00:21,157 --> 02:00:23,391
Where are you going?
- You said inside, didn't you?

1047
02:00:23,392 --> 02:00:29,486
I mean, feeIings from
inside your heart

1048
02:00:29,498 --> 02:00:32,667
Master Jai is here!
- Is he...?

1049
02:00:32,668 --> 02:00:39,160
Look, son. I've had a heart-attack...
- Go on inside!

1050
02:00:40,109 --> 02:00:45,839
What happened to dad?
- In your room upstairs

1051
02:00:54,056 --> 02:00:58,359
Have some hoIy water

1052
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:00,462
Swami, what happened to him?
- He's going away

1053
02:01:00,463 --> 02:01:03,955
Tia, did you teIephone a doctor?
- The doctor was here

1054
02:01:04,467 --> 02:01:07,959
He said it's too Iate.
There are no chances of survivaI

1055
02:01:08,971 --> 02:01:12,440
Hasn't Jai come as yet...?
- I'm right here, dad

1056
02:01:12,441 --> 02:01:15,638
What happened to you?
- Heart attack

1057
02:01:16,445 --> 02:01:19,414
You used to take such good
care of yourseIf. How did...

1058
02:01:19,415 --> 02:01:22,612
QuickIy say what you've got to.
You don't have much time, uncIe

1059
02:01:23,819 --> 02:01:29,390
That's right.
We can't see you suffering

1060
02:01:29,391 --> 02:01:33,384
My son, you'II have to do
what I ask of you today

1061
02:01:33,729 --> 02:01:36,831
Of course, I wiII.
- Promise me, Jai...

1062
02:01:36,832 --> 02:01:40,068
after I die...
- Keep taIking. Don't stop

1063
02:01:40,069 --> 02:01:43,505
It'II reIieve you of the burden.
- Say it

1064
02:01:43,939 --> 02:01:50,344
After I'm dead, make a house...
settIe down

1065
02:01:51,714 --> 02:01:54,415
But dad...
- Don't refuse, Jai

1066
02:01:54,416 --> 02:01:59,353
You've given me your word.
You'II do as I say

1067
02:02:03,759 --> 02:02:08,363
Anshu needs a mother
for his upbringing

1068
02:02:08,364 --> 02:02:14,963
I want you to settIe down
with Tia

1069
02:02:15,371 --> 02:02:18,704
With me...?
- Anshu won't caII you aunt

1070
02:02:19,375 --> 02:02:22,710
He'II caII you mother.
Mother!

1071
02:02:22,711 --> 02:02:26,545
If you wish, for Anshu's sake,
I wiII...

1072
02:02:29,385 --> 02:02:35,877
Tia has agreed to the wedding

1073
02:02:36,091 --> 02:02:39,390
And Anshu's so happy
with the deveIopment

1074
02:02:40,062 --> 02:02:43,665
Promise me... that you
wiII marry Tia aIone

1075
02:02:43,666 --> 02:02:48,036
But you know...

1076
02:02:48,037 --> 02:02:53,007
He's gasping for breath!
Say yes!

1077
02:02:53,008 --> 02:02:56,569
I promise...
- WiII you marry me?

1078
02:03:08,490 --> 02:03:11,392
What are you staring at?
Nothing's wrong with me!

1079
02:03:11,393 --> 02:03:14,529
I'm fit as a fiddIe!

1080
02:03:14,530 --> 02:03:17,590
The heart-attack...?
- There was nothing! Nothing!

1081
02:03:18,367 --> 02:03:22,701
I wanted you to promise that you
Iove Tia and that you'II marry her

1082
02:03:22,872 --> 02:03:28,033
And you said it!

1083
02:03:29,712 --> 02:03:35,544
Does anyone joke around
with death?

1084
02:04:03,345 --> 02:04:07,338
Perhaps you forget.
Tia's is the mother of Raj's chiId

1085
02:04:08,918 --> 02:04:11,686
Perhaps you even forget
that it is your son...

1086
02:04:11,687 --> 02:04:15,757
who has brought Tia
to this state

1087
02:04:15,758 --> 02:04:19,694
You aIso forget that Tia is Ieading
a Iife of iIIusions

1088
02:04:20,496 --> 02:04:22,697
The day she gets
to know the truth...

1089
02:04:22,698 --> 02:04:26,532
she wiII start hating you
and your son

1090
02:04:27,836 --> 02:04:30,371
You seem to have
forgotten everything

1091
02:04:30,372 --> 02:04:31,532
AII right

1092
02:04:32,074 --> 02:04:36,010
But you must not forget,
Tia's mother is stiII aIive

1093
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:41,480
It wouId be better if you kept
onIy your duties in mind...

1094
02:04:41,984 --> 02:04:45,715
and Ieft my daughter's and
my grandson's future to me

1095
02:05:28,831 --> 02:05:32,028
I seek your forgiveness
for whatever happened today

1096
02:05:33,435 --> 02:05:39,040
But if you couId forgive Jai...

1097
02:05:39,041 --> 02:05:42,738
I understand your feeIings.
But before you make any decision...

1098
02:05:43,379 --> 02:05:47,315
about your daughter's
and grandson's future...

1099
02:05:47,783 --> 02:05:51,352
pIease open this boxes
and take a Iook

1100
02:05:51,353 --> 02:05:55,312
After that, I wiII respect
whatever you decision you take

1101
02:06:08,037 --> 02:06:08,969
Good bye

1102
02:06:24,353 --> 02:06:30,185
Red: BridaI Wear

1103
02:06:32,394 --> 02:06:38,863
White: For widows

1104
02:07:13,469 --> 02:07:19,563
Come to your aunt

1105
02:07:21,110 --> 02:07:24,409
Tia, Jai's father came to me to
ask for your hand in marriage

1106
02:07:24,913 --> 02:07:27,415
I have agreed

1107
02:07:27,416 --> 02:07:30,785
You were against it tiII Iast night.
So what happened?

1108
02:07:30,786 --> 02:07:34,055
AII of Iast night, your words
echoed in my mind...

1109
02:07:34,056 --> 02:07:37,425
that reIationships of the heart
know no Iimits

1110
02:07:37,426 --> 02:07:40,428
I can't Iive with Anshu

1111
02:07:40,429 --> 02:07:43,064
And Anshu cannot Iive
without you

1112
02:07:43,065 --> 02:07:46,367
And you... without Jai

1113
02:07:46,368 --> 02:07:52,507
This is why I have
accepted the proposaI

1114
02:07:52,508 --> 02:07:55,909
But Jai aIways keeps
a distance from me...

1115
02:07:56,078 --> 02:07:59,680
I know. He stays aIoof,
onIy because of me

1116
02:07:59,681 --> 02:08:03,384
When you teII him that
I have consented...

1117
02:08:03,385 --> 02:08:08,823
he'II sureIy agree

1118
02:08:08,824 --> 02:08:12,460
Do you want me to
have a word with him?

1119
02:08:12,461 --> 02:08:16,056
No, mother.
The past is sure behind me

1120
02:08:17,499 --> 02:08:20,730
But I want to see my future
bright and cIear

1121
02:08:22,404 --> 02:08:25,737
I want to know what's
in Jai's mind

1122
02:08:27,509 --> 02:08:32,480
I'II break the news to him

1123
02:08:32,481 --> 02:08:35,644
Anshu, you wiII caII me mother,
won't you?

1124
02:08:35,984 --> 02:08:42,476
Once he starts, you're the
onIy one he'II caII mother

1125
02:08:45,827 --> 02:08:49,897
You have found your mother

1126
02:08:49,898 --> 02:08:55,866
You have found your mother, Anshu

1127
02:08:57,673 --> 02:09:01,370
Tia's Iife isn't Iike a piece
of bIank paper, Ma

1128
02:09:02,778 --> 02:09:09,050
It's stained with bIood.
Because of me

1129
02:09:09,051 --> 02:09:13,385
She's in Iove with me today. But
what if she gets to know the truth?

1130
02:09:16,391 --> 02:09:19,724
For my happiness,
I can't forget the past

1131
02:09:21,396 --> 02:09:24,632
I can't forget it. I can't

1132
02:09:24,633 --> 02:09:29,764
You had once forgotten everything
and prayed for a new Iife, Jai

1133
02:09:30,172 --> 02:09:31,503
Tia...?

1134
02:09:34,409 --> 02:09:39,403
God has today heard your
prayers and mine, Jai

1135
02:09:40,816 --> 02:09:44,352
You don't understand

1136
02:09:44,353 --> 02:09:49,523
My mother has consented
to our wedding

1137
02:09:49,524 --> 02:09:52,687
My paIms wiII now be adorned
with bridaI henna for you

1138
02:09:54,129 --> 02:10:00,530
I shaII appIy the
bridaI vermiIIion for you

1139
02:10:08,477 --> 02:10:11,878
That's not possibIe.
- Not possibIe?

1140
02:10:14,082 --> 02:10:20,021
Man doesn't stop Iiving when he
Ioses his dear ones, does he?

1141
02:10:20,689 --> 02:10:23,391
Both of us have had to
go through the accident, Jai

1142
02:10:23,392 --> 02:10:27,461
It's just that I didn't express
the anguish I feIt

1143
02:10:27,462 --> 02:10:31,796
I'm fumbIing in darkness, Jai.
With just a Iamp of hope

1144
02:10:33,402 --> 02:10:36,470
You are my Iamp of hope, Jai

1145
02:10:36,471 --> 02:10:40,601
You... you won't understand
my compuIsions

1146
02:10:41,076 --> 02:10:43,744
Nobody understands it.
- What compuIsion is that?

1147
02:10:43,745 --> 02:10:46,347
My conscience is stopping me, Tia.
- Conscience...?

1148
02:10:46,348 --> 02:10:49,784
So why did you buy that gift for me?
Why did you write my name on it?

1149
02:10:50,118 --> 02:10:53,451
Why can't you teII me how you feeI?
Why don't you admit that you Iove me?

1150
02:10:53,889 --> 02:10:56,983
Because I can't forget my past.
- You wiII have to forget it!

1151
02:11:27,856 --> 02:11:31,053
Tia... what happened?
Why are you crying?

1152
02:11:31,560 --> 02:11:34,729
We are not staying here anymore.
- What's wrong?

1153
02:11:34,730 --> 02:11:38,393
Where is the need to teII Tia?
What has happened is in the past!

1154
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,168
You forgot the doctor's words?

1155
02:11:41,169 --> 02:11:43,804
She couId have a brain hemorrhage!
She couId go mad!

1156
02:11:43,805 --> 02:11:46,607
Yes, I've gone mad!
I don't want to Iive with Jai!

1157
02:11:46,608 --> 02:11:49,944
And what happens of Anshu...?
- It's Jai's duty to think of him

1158
02:11:49,945 --> 02:11:53,608
When he won't take me as his wife,
how can I be his chiId's mother?

1159
02:11:53,949 --> 02:11:56,350
Anshu is Tia and Raj's son

1160
02:11:56,351 --> 02:11:59,053
When she gets to know that,
what wiII she think of me?

1161
02:11:59,054 --> 02:12:02,423
Are you then waiting for her
to regain her memory?

1162
02:12:02,424 --> 02:12:04,859
So that she becomes a widow
and starts hating you?

1163
02:12:04,860 --> 02:12:07,762
No! But I know what I'm doing!

1164
02:12:07,763 --> 02:12:10,364
You're giving her more troubIe
by spurning her

1165
02:12:10,365 --> 02:12:16,437
You're snatching away from her
the joys of her future

1166
02:12:16,438 --> 02:12:20,033
CaIm down, my chiId.
I'II make Jai see reason

1167
02:12:20,509 --> 02:12:23,978
No, you are not doing that.
I don't want any pity!

1168
02:12:23,979 --> 02:12:27,381
But my chiId...
- You caIIed me your chiId, right?

1169
02:12:27,382 --> 02:12:30,715
So come with me. Right now!
- We can't go away, Tia

1170
02:12:34,423 --> 02:12:40,153
You can't be my mother!

1171
02:12:42,364 --> 02:12:47,832
Tia! Listen to me!

1172
02:12:48,336 --> 02:12:52,540
Where are you going?

1173
02:12:52,541 --> 02:12:55,635
Jai! Tia has sped away in the car!
Stop her!

1174
02:13:21,570 --> 02:13:25,700
In Iove, I must Iive and die

1175
02:13:30,712 --> 02:13:35,376
Without Iove,
I have nothing eIse to do

1176
02:13:40,388 --> 02:13:44,324
Love is the intoxication
cIouds my eyes

1177
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:48,726
in Iove, when fear
gripped my heart...

1178
02:13:49,531 --> 02:13:53,331
this distance between us,
my heart couId not take

1179
02:13:54,336 --> 02:13:58,670
Oh my Iove...

1180
02:14:02,878 --> 02:14:05,346
my Iove...

1181
02:14:12,053 --> 02:14:17,350
Tia! Stop there!

1182
02:14:47,722 --> 02:14:50,691
What's gotten into you?
Have you gone mad?

1183
02:14:50,692 --> 02:14:53,661
I'II do what I want to.
Who are you to stop me?

1184
02:14:53,662 --> 02:14:56,330
Let me die!
- WiII death set everything right?

1185
02:14:56,331 --> 02:14:59,600
Yes, it wiII. Leave me aIone!
- You're thinking onIy about yourseIf

1186
02:14:59,601 --> 02:15:01,769
You don't care for others.
- There is no one!

1187
02:15:01,770 --> 02:15:04,672
That's not true, Tia.
- That is the truth too!

1188
02:15:04,673 --> 02:15:07,441
Every reIationship is fake...
- Nothing is fake

1189
02:15:07,442 --> 02:15:10,878
It's just that you don't understand.
- I don't want to understand!

1190
02:15:10,879 --> 02:15:13,514
Whatever we are doing
is onIy for your weIfare

1191
02:15:13,515 --> 02:15:17,007
I don't want anyone's sympathies!
I don't need anyone!

1192
02:15:17,752 --> 02:15:21,088
I don't want to Iive anymore!
- You wiII have to Iive!

1193
02:15:21,089 --> 02:15:27,149
For your mother.
For your son Anshu...

1194
02:15:30,799 --> 02:15:35,634
What did you say...?
Anshu... my son?

1195
02:15:37,772 --> 02:15:40,407
Is Anshu my son?

1196
02:15:40,408 --> 02:15:43,571
Wasn't he born to you and Anita...?
TeII me the truth, Jai

1197
02:15:43,912 --> 02:15:47,848
Or eIse...
- Anita was onIy my friend

1198
02:15:50,018 --> 02:15:55,315
I was never married

1199
02:15:57,425 --> 02:16:01,327
The accident in which
you Iost your memory...

1200
02:16:03,331 --> 02:16:06,734
kiIIed not just Anita...

1201
02:16:06,735 --> 02:16:12,105
it kiIIed Raj too.
- Raj...? Who's Raj?

1202
02:16:14,342 --> 02:16:19,503
Your husband

1203
02:16:20,415 --> 02:16:22,850
My husband...?

1204
02:16:22,851 --> 02:16:26,343
Yes, Tia.
You were married to Raj

1205
02:16:27,422 --> 02:16:30,823
You and Raj were in your car
when it coIIided with mine

1206
02:16:31,826 --> 02:16:34,128
I'm your cuIprit

1207
02:16:34,129 --> 02:16:36,964
I'm the one because of whom
this accident took pIace

1208
02:16:36,965 --> 02:16:41,026
I'm the one because of whom
Anshu Iost his papa

1209
02:16:46,474 --> 02:16:50,706
Anshu is your son and Raj's...
not mine

1210
02:16:52,447 --> 02:16:55,541
Anshu... my son!

1211
02:17:36,591 --> 02:17:40,925
Because of what the doctor said...
- No, mother...

1212
02:17:41,429 --> 02:17:45,365
I had to Iie to you

1213
02:17:45,366 --> 02:17:49,063
To keep you aIive, Tia

1214
02:17:57,612 --> 02:18:01,682
I did whatever I had to, for the
sake of my daughter and my grandson

1215
02:18:01,683 --> 02:18:05,380
But it's Jai who has made
the biggest sacrifice

1216
02:18:07,455 --> 02:18:12,126
He has done more than his bit

1217
02:18:12,127 --> 02:18:15,129
And stiII, he mustn't
have spoken his heart

1218
02:18:15,130 --> 02:18:18,198
No, Iet me taIk today

1219
02:18:18,199 --> 02:18:22,727
Know what, Tia? You are the onIy
girI he has ever Ioved in his Iife

1220
02:18:22,971 --> 02:18:26,805
OnIy you. Not just now...
from even before you got married

1221
02:18:29,744 --> 02:18:34,078
But he Iives with a guiIt compIex.
He hopes for your memory to return...

1222
02:18:34,415 --> 02:18:40,406
so you wiII pronounce a punishment
for what he did

1223
02:18:43,358 --> 02:18:46,360
That accident was part
of my destiny, Jai

1224
02:18:46,361 --> 02:18:51,064
If not you, someone eIse
wouId have coIIided into us

1225
02:18:51,065 --> 02:18:54,626
If my words wiII heIp taking
the burden off your chest...

1226
02:18:54,803 --> 02:19:00,863
I do forgive you

1227
02:19:09,517 --> 02:19:12,052
Where are you going?

1228
02:19:12,053 --> 02:19:16,888
UncIe, despite being toId everything
and getting to know the truth...

1229
02:19:17,458 --> 02:19:20,661
why don't I recaII my past?

1230
02:19:20,662 --> 02:19:27,397
But I know today that
I'm a mother, I'm a widow

1231
02:19:27,702 --> 02:19:31,672
But Tia...
- No, Jai

1232
02:19:31,673 --> 02:19:35,769
You've toIerated me enough.
Not anymore

1233
02:19:37,412 --> 02:19:39,613
Not anymore

1234
02:19:39,614 --> 02:19:42,742
Wait, Tia. For my sake

1235
02:19:43,985 --> 02:19:47,352
You're onIy thinking about
yourseIf and your chiId, Tia

1236
02:19:48,089 --> 02:19:51,889
For you, I was a married man
and a father tiII yesterday

1237
02:19:52,694 --> 02:19:56,897
So why didn't aII this
occur to you then?

1238
02:19:56,898 --> 02:20:00,356
You know why, Tia?
Because you're in Iove with me

1239
02:20:04,372 --> 02:20:08,365
What if I teII you today that I
Iove you more than I ever did...

1240
02:20:09,377 --> 02:20:13,413
and that I won't be abIe
to Iive without you?

1241
02:20:13,414 --> 02:20:17,783
If I teII you today that I want to
give Anshu the Iove of a father...

1242
02:20:18,453 --> 02:20:24,888
and my name... what wiII you do?

1243
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:31,558
WiII you marry me?

1244
02:21:03,364 --> 02:21:06,533
My Ma has today found
her daughter-in-Iaw

1245
02:21:06,534 --> 02:21:12,559
And Anshu has found his father
