1
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:11,522
I don't talk to no pretty women
when I'm on the road.

2
00:00:11,692 --> 00:00:13,159
Hard to get along with.

3
00:00:13,327 --> 00:00:15,090
You know, pretty women are
hard to get along with.

4
00:00:15,262 --> 00:00:18,789
An ugly woman is easy. You know,
they don't want no trouble, you know.

5
00:00:19,032 --> 00:00:20,294
I'm serious.

6
00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:23,129
They doing their thing,
cook all night for you.

7
00:00:23,337 --> 00:00:26,135
And I have bad luck
with women, y'all don't know.

8
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:27,796
Man, you don't know.

9
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,639
You meet a woman with their kids,
you can't even get none.

10
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:32,972
Go over girl's house, what,
4 in the morning.

11
00:00:33,146 --> 00:00:35,808
4:00 in the morning,
little kids still up.

12
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:38,984
Drinking coffee and taking NoDoz.

13
00:00:39,152 --> 00:00:42,178
You start yawning, they look at your
ass, talking about, "Can't hang, huh?"

14
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:45,157
We BeBe's kids.

15
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:46,815
We don't die, we...

16
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:48,358
...multiply!

17
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:09,276
I went to pick her up the next day,
and here she got four more kids.

18
00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:11,747
I said:

19
00:01:14,654 --> 00:01:16,281
"Who kids are them?"

20
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:18,356
She said, "Those are BeBe's kids."

21
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,117
Some guy out there,
some white guy out there

22
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:54,852
thought they were my... my kids.

23
00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:57,258
That's what made me mad.

24
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:59,058
"Bro, brother...

25
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:01,526
"Bro-ham.

26
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:05,334
"Tell me, are those your kids?"

27
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:08,030
"No, no way.
Ain't none of them my kids.

28
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,903
"Them BeBe's kids."

29
00:02:52,686 --> 00:02:54,210
I went to turn my radio on, man,

30
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:56,719
they tried to take my radio
while I'm listening to it.

31
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,187
Girl said, "Put the radio back,

32
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:00,724
"you know damn well we can't
get rid of no more 8-track.

33
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:02,384
"Put it back."

34
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:23,708
You cannot eat hot links on the bar.

35
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:28,651
Hey, mister, that beer has been here
since 12:00 this afternoon.

36
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:31,256
You either order again or
you got to go. I'm sorry.

37
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:33,858
I got some money-spending
people coming in here.

38
00:03:34,027 --> 00:03:35,324
I gotta make some room in here.

39
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:37,656
All these lowlife deadbeats
ain't never spending...

40
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:40,766
Hey. If you don't go somewhere and
sit down, I'm gonna knock you down,

41
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:44,700
you know that? You about
to get on my last nerve.

42
00:03:50,477 --> 00:03:52,069
What's wrong, Robin?

43
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:55,381
Woman trouble?

44
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:59,215
Get it off your chest.

45
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:02,048
I don't want to talk about it right now.

46
00:04:02,422 --> 00:04:05,619
Come on, man, you'll feel better.

47
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:08,986
Come on, boy, get it off your chest.

48
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:11,820
I don't want to talk about it right now.

49
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:14,592
Man, you can't walk around with
problems staying inside you.

50
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:17,737
The best thing to do is let it out.
You'll feel better.

51
00:04:18,405 --> 00:04:20,498
Not right now. I really ain't
got nothing to say.

52
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:22,608
All right.

53
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:25,574
- All right.
- I knew she was trouble.

54
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:27,337
I should have known it
when I met her.

55
00:04:27,514 --> 00:04:29,880
It was at a funeral.

56
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:33,083
Oh, Lord!

57
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,587
- Oh, Walter!
- Everybody was there.

58
00:04:41,027 --> 00:04:43,052
Because everybody was
glad he was dead.

59
00:04:43,263 --> 00:04:46,460
He was about 4-feet-3. Wore
those high-heeled shoes all the time.

60
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:47,964
He was about 5-feet-6,

61
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:50,967
but when that truck hit him,
kind of cut him down a little bit.

62
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:54,763
Look at this brick house.

63
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:56,431
Damn!

64
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,274
She so fine, she make you
want to get a job, with benefits.

65
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:22,698
Let's play the game, man.

66
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:25,963
I'm playing the game, man,
you just looking to hit. Hit that!

67
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:27,629
- Drop something down!
- I don't know.

68
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:31,174
- In Beverly Hills, we don't play that.
- I'm gonna take all your money.

69
00:05:31,611 --> 00:05:33,272
That boy is crazy, ain't he crazy?

70
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:35,641
Look who just walk in here.
Hey, Robin.

71
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:37,680
Come over here.
You've been working last week.

72
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:39,716
- Come and lose some of that money.
- Oh, no.

73
00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:42,650
Only way I'd lose money to y'all
if I had a hole in my pocket.

74
00:05:42,822 --> 00:05:45,723
Then sit down and quit trying to
look at everybody's hand.

75
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:47,120
Shut up, you old fat fool.

76
00:05:47,293 --> 00:05:49,659
You so big you don't know if
you're walking or rolling.

77
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:52,525
I'm not fat. I'm pleasantly plump.
I keep telling you that.

78
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:55,395
Boy, I'm so glad that
damn Walter is dead.

79
00:05:55,568 --> 00:05:58,196
Who ain't? The only reason
his widow is over there crying

80
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:01,602
is because he didn't leave
her no life insurance.

81
00:06:04,077 --> 00:06:07,205
I'm sorry to hear that, because
he died owing me money again.

82
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,247
Shoot, Walter owed everybody money.
Let me tell y'all something.

83
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:13,614
That Walter was so cheap, he
wouldn't spend a lovely evening.

84
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:17,980
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

85
00:06:18,158 --> 00:06:20,422
Who's that girl in that black dress?

86
00:06:20,593 --> 00:06:22,993
Good God almighty.

87
00:06:23,163 --> 00:06:25,154
- Which one?
- With the braids.

88
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:27,458
- Have mercy.
- Oh, her?

89
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:31,035
- She was Walter's secretary.
- I'll bet she can't type a stroke.

90
00:06:31,204 --> 00:06:34,401
Type? I don't think she had to type.

91
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:37,771
Hey, Rudy, ain't your wife a secretary?

92
00:06:37,944 --> 00:06:41,072
Y'all stop this stuff now,
I'm trying to win this game.

93
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:43,840
Here she comes.

94
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:52,692
Y'all ever notice that Walter smelled?

95
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:54,622
He's got that new deodorant on.

96
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:57,194
I think it's called formaldehyde.

97
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,691
You sure look good in black, baby!

98
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:09,103
She puts me in the mind
of Players magazine.

99
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:10,970
Nineteen seventy-three.

100
00:07:11,144 --> 00:07:13,738
Pam Grier issue.

101
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:17,209
That's the one, that's the one.

102
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:20,280
I know it's hard now.

103
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:23,111
If you need me, call me.

104
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:26,121
OK? All right.

105
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:30,790
Hey, look here y'all, I gotta go.
Because while I'll be at work tomorrow,

106
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:33,091
y'all be in a bed dreaming about a job.

107
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:35,894
At least we be dreaming and not
hauling nobody else's trash.

108
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:37,263
That's for sure.

109
00:07:38,238 --> 00:07:40,229
I like funerals.
I'm glad I went to a funeral.

110
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:42,237
I'll be glad when I go to yours.

111
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,507
Excuse me, miss.
I didn't catch your name.

112
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:52,651
- Didn't throw it.
- Well, my name is Robin.

113
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:54,650
Robin.

114
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:57,381
That explains the red vest.

115
00:07:57,557 --> 00:08:00,924
Oh, like the bird.
That's kind of cute.

116
00:08:01,094 --> 00:08:03,722
A little festive for this event, though.

117
00:08:03,897 --> 00:08:05,728
Shoot, I don't care nothing
about no Walter.

118
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:09,164
I could have come to Walter's
funeral in my drawers.

119
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:16,503
Pretty late for a woman to
be catching the bus all alone.

120
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:18,974
- Do you need a ride?
- No, thank you.

121
00:08:19,145 --> 00:08:20,237
I have a car.

122
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:23,109
Well, mind giving me one, then?

123
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:30,513
Well, that sure was a
nice funeral, wasn't it?

124
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:34,725
Well, that sure is a good sign, you feel
comfortable enough to give me a ride,

125
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:37,124
even though you don't know
a damn thing about me.

126
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:40,357
Because I could be crazy, you know.

127
00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:45,360
I hate doing a favor for somebody
who make you want to take it back.

128
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:47,301
You know, like when you
give somebody a ride,

129
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:49,338
and they got a warrant out on them.

130
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:52,876
Hey, hey, tell a brother buckle up first.

131
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:55,139
You trying to tell me
something with that story?

132
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:58,375
I'm just trying to tell you a funny
story. Trying to amuse you.

133
00:08:58,551 --> 00:09:00,712
But you're trying to kill me in
this little thing.

134
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:05,187
- Sorry. You made me nervous.
- Well, you ain't the only one.

135
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:07,625
So, what's your name?

136
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:13,254
She said she had to pick up her
son at the babysitter.

137
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:17,961
And I asked why didn't she just have
her husband to watch the kids.

138
00:09:18,137 --> 00:09:20,537
After all, a good father
should be wanting to spend

139
00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:23,175
some quality time with his kids.

140
00:09:23,343 --> 00:09:27,040
When that becomes your business,
I'll ask your advice.

141
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:28,976
She said she was divorced.

142
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:30,877
Once I saw the kid,

143
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:32,912
I knew I had it made.

144
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:36,055
Because you know I'm good with kids.

145
00:09:36,556 --> 00:09:38,387
Hey, little buddy,

146
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:41,152
what did you do tonight, huh?

147
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:43,557
- Man, I don't even know you.
- Leon.

148
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,096
Sorry. We watched videos.

149
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:47,961
I got a movie you
should watch next time.

150
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:50,068
It's called Dolemite
and it's about these pimps...

151
00:09:50,236 --> 00:09:52,261
Now, why do you think

152
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:55,407
I'm going to let my son see one
of those killer pimp movies?

153
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:57,099
You must not have seen Dolemite.

154
00:09:57,277 --> 00:10:00,804
Because that movie will teach
you to appreciate poetry.

155
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:03,875
Way down in the jungle deep

156
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,383
The badass lion stepped on
The signifying monkey's feet

157
00:10:07,854 --> 00:10:09,947
Dolemite, my man.

158
00:10:10,123 --> 00:10:13,354
- You know, that's romantic.
- Anyway.

159
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,526
I could tell he was a nice kid. But she
was sheltering him a little too much.

160
00:10:17,931 --> 00:10:20,525
But she couldn't help but see
how good we was getting along.

161
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:33,340
So, Dakota Staton's playing down
at the Regal Room next Friday

162
00:10:33,513 --> 00:10:35,845
and I would love for you
to come with me.

163
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:38,381
But I wouldn't know what to call you.

164
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:40,917
- Jamika.
- Oh, Jamika.

165
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:44,419
So how does Dakota
at the Regal sound?

166
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,115
And find a babysitter
on a Friday night?

167
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:49,955
If you want to get better acquainted
with me and my son,

168
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:55,066
you should take us somewhere
more appropriate, like...

169
00:10:55,468 --> 00:10:57,800
...oh, Fun World.
- Fun World.

170
00:10:57,971 --> 00:11:00,235
- Yeah.
- So I said, "No problem.

171
00:11:00,406 --> 00:11:02,897
- "I'll pick y'all up Saturday at 10."
- No.

172
00:11:06,746 --> 00:11:10,580
Y'all know me,
I'm an old-fashioned type of guy.

173
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,877
I didn't have to get a kiss that night.

174
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:15,077
Yeah, that night.

175
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:17,518
But wait till he spends some money.

176
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:41,446
Look at this cheap thing.

177
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:44,643
So I goes to pick her
up the next day.

178
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:46,845
She got three more kids with her.

179
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:51,313
- What's this? What's this?
- These are children.

180
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:53,959
Wait. You said you had a kid.

181
00:11:54,127 --> 00:11:57,221
These are BeBe's kids.
This is LaShawn.

182
00:11:58,264 --> 00:12:00,323
Oh, critter number one.

183
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:05,027
I ought to beat the... Oh.

184
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:06,569
- This is Kahlil.
- What's up?

185
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:08,570
- What's up?
- Kind of militant.

186
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:10,368
You a Farra-Chaka Khan?

187
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:12,511
- Come on, man, give it up.
- OK. That's OK. Hey!

188
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:14,873
- Man, you don't know how to shake?
- I said...

189
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:17,676
That's pitiful. Old man like you.

190
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,580
Look at this.
Look like a broken-down spring.

191
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:25,055
I ought to slap you with the
two fingers I got left.

192
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:27,725
What the?

193
00:12:30,396 --> 00:12:34,423
- And this is little Pee Wee.
- Pee Wee, the O.G.

194
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,503
O. G? I'll slap my F-O-O-T
in your B-U-T.

195
00:12:39,672 --> 00:12:42,402
Oh, my goodness. Those aren't
double-knit pants, are they?

196
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:44,566
Trying to bring it back, huh?

197
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:46,336
What is this?

198
00:12:47,146 --> 00:12:50,445
- So where's BeBe?
- She went downtown.

199
00:12:50,616 --> 00:12:52,880
So how come she didn't take
her little tribe with her?

200
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:57,682
Don't worry about it, she left $20
to get her kids into Fun World.

201
00:12:57,857 --> 00:12:59,848
BeBe left $20.

202
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:02,859
Twenty dollars ain't enough
gas to put in my car.

203
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:06,225
He don't look too happy to
see us, do he, LaShawn?

204
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,063
She left $20 here, for me to take
these 80 kids out. Ain't that a...

205
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:14,729
Come on, Robin. The kids can't wait.
I can't either.

206
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:17,637
This going to be fun.

207
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:52,845
Hey, look. What's up with all those?

208
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:55,338
- Ma!
- Don't be a tattletale.

209
00:13:55,515 --> 00:13:58,609
And make us lose the little
respect that we do have for you.

210
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:02,117
- What's wrong, Leon?
- Nothing.

211
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:09,055
Man, why you always
messing with me?

212
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:11,059
- Because she like you.
- I do not.

213
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,130
- It's just because...
- She thinks you cute.

214
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,290
I ain't going with no runt like Leon.

215
00:14:15,468 --> 00:14:17,026
She can't wait for you to grow up.

216
00:14:17,203 --> 00:14:18,795
I had enough of you.

217
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:22,338
- Hey, break it up back there!
- Hey, don't worry, honey.

218
00:14:22,508 --> 00:14:25,204
Once we get there,
everything will be just fine.

219
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:27,471
Just fine.

220
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:45,797
Come on, Leon. Wake up,
sweetie. We almost here.

221
00:14:46,065 --> 00:14:48,033
Wake up, kids.

222
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:55,902
Robin, you can slow down
now, we're here.

223
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,933
Robin!

224
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,543
Robin, wake up!

225
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:08,885
Thank you, ma'am.
You have a fun time, now.

226
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:12,516
Step out of the car.

227
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:16,556
Now, sir, you came to
quite an abrupt stop.

228
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:18,993
Carrying any illegal substances?

229
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:21,065
- Concealed fruits?
- Hey! Hey!

230
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:24,169
- Vegetables?
- No, I left that at home with the gun.

231
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:25,599
Stay right there.

232
00:15:25,771 --> 00:15:27,636
Trying to make me feel
like a king, huh?

233
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,400
Everyone's king
at Fun World, sir.

234
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:35,243
Don't even try it.

235
00:15:40,853 --> 00:15:43,321
God, I hate kids.

236
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:46,855
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

237
00:15:47,026 --> 00:15:48,857
welcome to Fun World.

238
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:53,192
Thirty-five dollars?
That's for the whole group, right?

239
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,199
One, two, three, four, five.

240
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:01,602
Jamika, give me that $20 BeBe left.

241
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:04,439
Say.

242
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:07,839
Well, look what we have here.

243
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:11,073
- Are you starting trouble?
- Definitely a troublemaker.

244
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,981
He's a 4-15 in progress.

245
00:16:15,154 --> 00:16:17,816
Back off my tip. I was just
getting a drink of water.

246
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,391
- Watch that hostile attitude.
- We'll ask the questions, kid.

247
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,084
What's this on your hat?

248
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:25,560
It looks like some sort of gang insignia.

249
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:28,427
Look, I ain't in no gang,
now give me back my hat.

250
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:31,297
I said, give me back my hat.

251
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:39,611
You just remember,

252
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,009
we'll be watching you.

253
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:45,776
You troublemaker delinquent.

254
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,111
Hundred ninety-seven...

255
00:16:49,822 --> 00:16:51,653
...ninety-eight...

256
00:16:52,258 --> 00:16:54,021
...ninety-nine...

257
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,893
...two hundred!

258
00:16:58,397 --> 00:16:59,989
Don't act like you don't want it.

259
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,137
What do you say to Mr. Harris, kids?

260
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:09,501
- F...
- Thank you.

261
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,642
Here are your tickets,
programs, maps,

262
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:17,249
senior-citizen discount cards,
tennis shoes, a basketball, mugs,

263
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,782
decals, bumper stickers,
coupons, napkins,

264
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:23,444
swizzle sticks, visor,
sweat band and a T-shirt.

265
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:27,453
Please familiarize and observe
the rules while in Fun World.

266
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:30,959
No running, no jumping, no yelling,

267
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,293
no cutting in line, no grumbling,
no stealing.

268
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:35,695
That means you.

269
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:39,269
No breaking things and putting
them back like nothing happened.

270
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:43,306
No sad faces, bad attitudes,
introspective moments,

271
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:46,502
irritation at the mindless
happiness of the masses.

272
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:49,045
And... no littering.

273
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:52,241
Is that clear? Enjoy your stay.

274
00:17:52,618 --> 00:17:54,711
All right, don't run around
and work up an appetite.

275
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:56,514
I ain't feeding you little heathens.

276
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:59,852
And don't touch a damn thing!

277
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:08,261
Found mine.

278
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:10,197
How come we can't
never find our name?

279
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:12,394
Yeah, I know four girls
named LaShawn.

280
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:16,598
How come we don't have
a license plate? Kahlil?

281
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:41,229
Warning. You have activated
a maximum-security system.

282
00:18:42,568 --> 00:18:44,229
Do not panic.

283
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:03,009
Excuse me, sir,

284
00:20:03,182 --> 00:20:07,881
but I have to charge you for the items
your kids manhandled in the store.

285
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:12,489
Oh, where did Pee Wee go?

286
00:20:12,658 --> 00:20:14,353
I ain't saying jack.

287
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:16,654
Oh, you ain't going to talk, huh?
Come here!

288
00:20:16,896 --> 00:20:20,059
You don't tell me where your little
brother is, I'll beat the black off you.

289
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:21,995
You gonna look
lighter than Michael Jackson.

290
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:25,034
Where is he? Where is he?

291
00:21:16,188 --> 00:21:17,450
But we was just playing.

292
00:21:17,623 --> 00:21:19,682
Other kids are playing too.

293
00:21:19,858 --> 00:21:22,691
Start up again, I'm going to drop you
like a bad habit. You hear that?

294
00:21:22,962 --> 00:21:26,762
- Yeah.
- Test-tube baby.

295
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,757
Can we eat? Man, I'm hungry.

296
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:30,697
We were too excited to have breakfast.

297
00:21:30,869 --> 00:21:32,166
Yeah, that's it.

298
00:21:32,338 --> 00:21:35,569
BeBe don't keep nothing in her fridge.

299
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:38,434
I tell you, Jamika, that BeBe,
she's getting on my nerves.

300
00:21:38,611 --> 00:21:41,409
I ain't even met the child.

301
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,741
Look at these poor children.
Look at them, starving.

302
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,316
They be better off in Ethiopia.

303
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:48,712
Mama said knock you out

304
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:50,718
I'm gonna knock you out

305
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,617
Mama said knock you out

306
00:21:56,328 --> 00:21:59,729
Hello, Robin. Long time, no see.

307
00:22:01,634 --> 00:22:03,226
Hi, Dorothea.

308
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:06,929
I been meaning to call you,
but my phone got shut off.

309
00:22:07,106 --> 00:22:08,733
Funny, I always get your
machine when I call.

310
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:11,671
Oh, I can get incoming,
but I just can't dial out.

311
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,004
Don't worry. I'm not gonna sweat
you for my alimony check.

312
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,580
I'm just here to have fun.
Just like you.

313
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,412
Oh, Robin. This is my friend Vivian.

314
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:22,884
Oh, Lord, not another one.

315
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:26,954
Damn.

316
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:28,991
Quite an appetite you got there.

317
00:22:29,161 --> 00:22:31,595
Oh, yeah, well, you know,
I came with some people.

318
00:22:31,764 --> 00:22:35,165
- Well, that was quick. Was I so...
- Dorothea.

319
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:37,859
I gotta go. Food's getting cold.

320
00:22:38,704 --> 00:22:42,196
Food ain't the only thing
cold around here.

321
00:22:45,244 --> 00:22:48,008
You know he still love you.

322
00:22:50,716 --> 00:22:52,206
Was she born to torture me?
Look at her.

323
00:22:52,384 --> 00:22:55,979
Can't even wear high-heel shoes. Just
sliding and sliding all over the place.

324
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:58,851
Smoke coming out, look like
a train coming down a aisle.

325
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:01,288
I remember one time she
went into Lane Bryant.

326
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,894
"I would like to see
something to fit me."

327
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:06,224
Sales lady looked at her,
said, "Me too."

328
00:23:06,598 --> 00:23:10,125
Seeing that skeezer made me feel
even better about being with Jamika.

329
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:12,736
- She's about something.
- What about the kids?

330
00:23:13,072 --> 00:23:15,267
The kids? You kidding me?

331
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:17,466
Those kids must have
missed a few meals.

332
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:19,008
They were eating so fast...

333
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:23,072
...I had to spit on my food
to keep them from taking mine.

334
00:23:24,116 --> 00:23:26,141
Sorry about that there.

335
00:23:26,318 --> 00:23:29,185
So then I took them on
the scariest ride in the park.

336
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:31,288
And that kept them behaved.

337
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,163
Yes! Yeah!

338
00:23:45,337 --> 00:23:48,568
No. No. No. No!

339
00:23:59,885 --> 00:24:01,375
Y'all smell something?

340
00:24:01,553 --> 00:24:03,020
Pee Wee, is that you?

341
00:24:09,394 --> 00:24:11,862
Jamika, this is the last
time I take you...

342
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:14,527
...and these crazy kids...

343
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:17,198
...anywhere!

344
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:20,133
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

345
00:24:26,845 --> 00:24:28,312
Bye, Leon.

346
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:42,820
Hey, this is fun, right?

347
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:51,926
OK, you can pull the cord now.
The cord. Pee Wee!

348
00:24:52,104 --> 00:24:54,504
You mean this cord right here?

349
00:25:27,573 --> 00:25:30,565
What's the matter? Can't hang?

350
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:48,286
I'm just glad it didn't happen
on the roller coaster,

351
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,758
because you would have got me too.

352
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:53,898
- Thank you, Mr. Harris.
- Oh, you welcome, son.

353
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:55,966
Just lay off them chili dogs.

354
00:26:02,507 --> 00:26:06,238
Come on, boy. Clay, Kyle,
whatever your name is, you next.

355
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:08,777
Father faker.

356
00:26:11,516 --> 00:26:13,416
Since the kids started acting civilized,

357
00:26:13,585 --> 00:26:15,314
we let them go off on their own.

358
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:19,389
And me and Jamika took
a little boat trip.

359
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:32,599
Mama, I want to go with you.

360
00:26:33,939 --> 00:26:35,873
You can't be with us now, sweetie.

361
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,009
Now, just run along and
play with your friends.

362
00:26:38,176 --> 00:26:40,906
Friends? Those are not my friends.

363
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,842
I hate when you babysit BeBe's kids.

364
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:45,973
Why couldn't we go
to Fun World alone?

365
00:26:46,184 --> 00:26:48,015
Oh, honey.

366
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,745
Leon, come here.

367
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:53,822
Now, I know you don't like BeBe's kids.

368
00:26:53,992 --> 00:26:55,516
I don't like them kids either.

369
00:26:55,827 --> 00:26:58,091
But you all don't have
to like each other.

370
00:26:58,263 --> 00:27:00,823
But they do have to respect you.

371
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:03,297
Now, that's something I can't
make them do, Leon.

372
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:06,169
You have to do it for yourself.

373
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:09,239
- How do I get respect?
- Easy.

374
00:27:09,408 --> 00:27:11,899
Don't worry about what
they think about you.

375
00:27:12,077 --> 00:27:13,977
Just do what you do best,

376
00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:17,513
and then you'll win respect
on your own terms.

377
00:27:17,683 --> 00:27:18,980
- That's it?
- Yeah.

378
00:27:19,217 --> 00:27:21,117
Oh, and one other thing.

379
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,911
If you get into a fight, don't fight fair.

380
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:27,183
Get a brick and knock
the hell out of them kids.

381
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:29,384
Robin, I heard you.

382
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:31,961
All right, little man.
Have a good time.

383
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,496
And remember what I said.

384
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,497
Bye, Mama.

385
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:39,268
Thanks, Mr. Harris.

386
00:27:40,505 --> 00:27:42,405
I don't mean to get in your business,

387
00:27:42,574 --> 00:27:45,907
but maybe you should sign Leon
up for some karate classes.

388
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:48,410
That boy kind of soft.

389
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:52,983
Step right up, young fellow.
Give it a good hit, now.

390
00:27:54,753 --> 00:27:57,847
If that's the best you can do, you'll
have to come back in a couple years.

391
00:27:58,023 --> 00:28:00,218
Come on now, move along.
Move along.

392
00:28:00,392 --> 00:28:04,192
Who will be next to test their
strength? Step right up.

393
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:06,556
Look who's back. Little Leon.

394
00:28:06,732 --> 00:28:09,200
Welcome back, weenie.

395
00:28:09,368 --> 00:28:13,202
Oh, yeah, here he is, the weenie man.

396
00:28:13,805 --> 00:28:16,933
You ready? I thought you was gonna
hang around your mama leg all day.

397
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:18,872
At least my mama's here.

398
00:28:20,012 --> 00:28:21,741
Well, your mama ain't
gonna be here to catch you

399
00:28:21,913 --> 00:28:23,938
when I knock you out,
so you better watch your mouth

400
00:28:24,116 --> 00:28:25,481
because you're talking
about our mama.

401
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,278
- Yeah.
- What's up with that, man?

402
00:28:40,198 --> 00:28:43,258
Hey, kids! Time for another
Cartoon Cavalcade

403
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:46,302
at Fun World Playhouse
on Flea Street.

404
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:48,905
With plenty of free popcorn.

405
00:28:49,074 --> 00:28:51,770
Come on, let's get a good seat.

406
00:28:51,943 --> 00:28:54,571
Don't try to change the subject.

407
00:28:54,746 --> 00:28:58,011
So, what up with that? Y'all
gonna scrap or give a hug?

408
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,911
Go on, kiss her.

409
00:29:03,522 --> 00:29:05,547
We got them good.

410
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:10,689
Look at that expression on her face.

411
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:15,726
- Mack daddy, Leon.
- Oh, yeah, player of the year.

412
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:19,302
You got it going on, baby, like no other.

413
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:21,962
You guys play too much, man.

414
00:29:23,775 --> 00:29:26,801
I'm gonna get you guys, you know
I don't like kissing boys.

415
00:29:32,284 --> 00:29:33,546
I'm gonna get you two.

416
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:41,884
No wonder they going so much faster.

417
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,618
Get some of this food off the boat.

418
00:29:43,795 --> 00:29:46,025
- Well, I need it to live.
- Get that chicken out your purse.

419
00:29:46,665 --> 00:29:49,793
You really have been sweet
with the kids today, Robin.

420
00:29:49,968 --> 00:29:52,835
- Jamika, is BeBe your sister?
- No.

421
00:29:53,004 --> 00:29:54,403
Is she your cousin?

422
00:29:54,906 --> 00:29:56,635
Is her man your loan shark?

423
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,240
BeBe is a friend.

424
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:03,404
Shoot, I would want somebody to help
me if I had problems like she does.

425
00:30:03,582 --> 00:30:07,575
They got correctional facilities for
problems like that, Jamika.

426
00:30:08,253 --> 00:30:10,414
They just need a strong
man in their life.

427
00:30:10,589 --> 00:30:12,580
- You got any kids?
- Nope.

428
00:30:12,824 --> 00:30:14,951
- Ever been married?
- Next question.

429
00:30:15,393 --> 00:30:17,418
Do you want kids?

430
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,592
Hell, no!

431
00:30:19,764 --> 00:30:22,562
Especially if they turn out to
be like BeBe's kids.

432
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:25,601
But you know, you're
really good with them.

433
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,637
Not that I like you for the kids.

434
00:30:28,807 --> 00:30:30,775
I like you.

435
00:30:31,376 --> 00:30:35,176
Sometimes it just don't seem like the
right things happen to the right people.

436
00:30:35,347 --> 00:30:38,339
Or the right people just don't be
at the right place at the right time.

437
00:30:38,517 --> 00:30:40,178
Yeah, like the white people
on Arsenio's band.

438
00:30:40,352 --> 00:30:44,186
- Robin, I mean BeBe.
- Hold up, Jamika.

439
00:30:44,356 --> 00:30:47,018
That's enough talk about BeBe.

440
00:30:47,192 --> 00:30:49,592
I only know one thing.

441
00:30:49,761 --> 00:30:51,991
I'm definitely in the right place,

442
00:30:52,164 --> 00:30:53,995
at the right time.

443
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,758
Right now.

444
00:30:56,268 --> 00:30:58,031
Just scoot them baby hips over.

445
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,138
Boy, you crazy.

446
00:32:55,153 --> 00:32:58,452
Hey, y'all can't leave me,
the little O.G.

447
00:33:01,226 --> 00:33:04,252
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

448
00:33:05,397 --> 00:33:09,265
- Hey, man, are you out of your mind?
- Hey Kahlil, over here.

449
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:17,434
Hey, up here. Down here.

450
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,575
Hey, Pee Wee, I froze you.

451
00:33:23,114 --> 00:33:25,947
It's too hot to stay froze.

452
00:33:26,484 --> 00:33:29,112
Oh, I see a popsicle coming now.

453
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:39,287
- Where are your parents?
- Yeah. Your mommy and daddy.

454
00:33:39,464 --> 00:33:42,922
Where you think they at? Over
your parents' house playing pinochle.

455
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:47,265
Another smart remark and you'll
be ejected from Fun World.

456
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:48,531
Understand?

457
00:33:48,707 --> 00:33:51,005
Unsupervised minors are
prohibited from engaging

458
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:54,144
in unauthorized leisure activities.

459
00:33:54,312 --> 00:33:56,507
- Yeah, no laying around.
- Shut up.

460
00:33:56,681 --> 00:33:57,978
- I do all the talking.
- All right.

461
00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:00,140
We weren't in anybody's way, OK?

462
00:34:00,318 --> 00:34:03,344
The issue is not obstruction
of walkways.

463
00:34:03,555 --> 00:34:06,023
Oh, so you trying to say
we can't play freeze tag?

464
00:34:06,191 --> 00:34:09,422
Correct. However, we have
a variety of engrossing...

465
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:11,824
Yeah, real scary.

466
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:14,897
...exhibits designed for
your age demographic.

467
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:19,765
Allow me to escort you
to my personal favorite.

468
00:34:19,938 --> 00:34:21,701
- Follow him.
- Get your hands off me.

469
00:34:21,873 --> 00:34:23,738
Let's go, people.

470
00:34:25,043 --> 00:34:27,603
- Safety first.
- Strap them in tighter.

471
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:30,373
- Good night, Gracie.
- All clear here.

472
00:34:30,548 --> 00:34:33,415
We're on our way
back to headquarters.

473
00:34:33,585 --> 00:34:37,419
Everything is A-OK.

474
00:35:33,278 --> 00:35:36,042
Halt. No one under 17 admitted
without parent or guardian.

475
00:36:09,948 --> 00:36:14,078
- Just as I suspected.
- Just as we suspected.

476
00:36:14,252 --> 00:36:18,484
- Get those kids!
- Oh, no!

477
00:36:38,576 --> 00:36:41,602
- Way to go, Leon.
- Yeah, I knew you had it in you.

478
00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:44,771
I knew you had a little BeBe in you.

479
00:36:52,323 --> 00:36:54,052
All right!

480
00:36:54,425 --> 00:36:57,417
- Wow. Who are you guys?
- We BeBe's kids.

481
00:36:57,595 --> 00:37:02,726
- BeBe's kids?
- Yeah. We don't die, we multiply.

482
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:05,165
- All right.
- Who's he?

483
00:37:05,336 --> 00:37:08,237
- He's just a punk.
- Man, I ain't no punk.

484
00:37:08,406 --> 00:37:12,240
- Oh, so you down, then?
- Yeah. For whatever.

485
00:37:13,811 --> 00:37:16,746
Hey, yo. Can we be BeBe's kids?

486
00:37:19,918 --> 00:37:22,751
No, punk. But you can
hang with us for a while.

487
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:26,049
- Yeah, all right.
- That's cool, dude.

488
00:37:31,095 --> 00:37:33,928
- What's your name, man?
- My name's Winthrop.

489
00:37:34,098 --> 00:37:38,592
Winthrop? No, man,
we calling you Opie.

490
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:41,330
- My name's Richie.
- Like the comic book Richie?

491
00:37:41,506 --> 00:37:43,701
Damn, you guys
got some corny names.

492
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:45,274
What's your name?

493
00:37:45,443 --> 00:37:50,278
I'm the jaw breaker, the candy taker
And if I skip school I'm the flu faker

494
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:52,541
Original man in a strange land

495
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:54,947
You never saw my butt
On American Bandstand

496
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,212
The MC's name is Kahlil

497
00:37:57,388 --> 00:37:59,720
And if you can't spell it
You never will

498
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:01,791
Allah the provider
For the flavor you're lacking

499
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,158
But if you stop my flow
Start straight jacking

500
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:08,193
Look.

501
00:38:08,366 --> 00:38:10,300
Straight jacking

502
00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:13,197
Straight, straight
Straight jacking

503
00:38:13,371 --> 00:38:15,635
I'm LaShawn
No, not Latifah

504
00:38:15,807 --> 00:38:18,401
Demanding the mike just like Aretha

505
00:38:18,576 --> 00:38:20,567
Cute little girl but I fight like a man

506
00:38:20,745 --> 00:38:23,043
I even made
Iron Mike Tyson say "Damn!"

507
00:38:23,214 --> 00:38:27,378
LaShawn, Kahlil and Pee Wee
Want R-E-S-P-E-C-T

508
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:29,747
Never slipping, or sliding
No macking or slacking

509
00:38:29,921 --> 00:38:32,754
BeBe's kids, straight jacking

510
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:38,562
We've got an assault
on characters in Section Five.

511
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,789
Order received.

512
00:38:41,299 --> 00:38:44,132
Shorty
The O. G. With all the clout

513
00:38:44,302 --> 00:38:46,133
Lip smacking
For what's under the blouse

514
00:38:46,304 --> 00:38:48,499
Three years old
And still drinking Similac

515
00:38:48,673 --> 00:38:50,937
You smack me
And I'll smack you back, punk

516
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:53,100
So now it's time for me
To straight jack y'all

517
00:38:53,277 --> 00:38:55,177
And get busy like Arsenio Hall

518
00:38:55,346 --> 00:39:01,148
Taking a dump can be so relaxing
Straight jacking

519
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:04,447
Hi, boys and girls,
I'm Rodney Rodent.

520
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:08,615
And I'm Tommy Toad.
How are you doing today?

521
00:39:08,793 --> 00:39:11,057
It goes three for the treble
And two for the bass

522
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:13,094
We're BeBe's kids
And we're wrecking this place

523
00:39:13,431 --> 00:39:16,195
Now all bad kids
Seem to always get spanked

524
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:18,198
But try that with us
And you might get ganked

525
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:20,337
Release the balloons
And act real funny

526
00:39:20,505 --> 00:39:22,700
As we ride rides
And Robin spends money

527
00:39:22,874 --> 00:39:25,502
To my posse won't be no attacking
Hey, yo

528
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:27,975
We ain't wild
We're straight jacking

529
00:39:30,448 --> 00:39:34,316
- Yo, they trying to get away.
- Rush them.

530
00:39:34,852 --> 00:39:38,447
Rodney, come on.
Let's get out of here.

531
00:39:38,623 --> 00:39:40,989
- You're on your own, Rodney.
- Let go.

532
00:39:50,668 --> 00:39:52,465
Rodney!

533
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:55,366
Rodney!

534
00:40:02,914 --> 00:40:05,906
Oh, not the feet.
I've only got two of them.

535
00:40:07,285 --> 00:40:09,879
These'll work.
We can use these to go swimming.

536
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:18,486
- Look, there they are.
- 5-0. Run.

537
00:40:18,663 --> 00:40:20,824
Fun World.

538
00:40:20,998 --> 00:40:23,990
Come back here, you little
scum-buckets. I'm gonna get you.

539
00:40:24,168 --> 00:40:26,466
Oh, Robin. It looks like
there's some trouble.

540
00:40:26,637 --> 00:40:30,232
Trouble? Girl, you from Compton.
That ain't no kind of trouble.

541
00:40:30,408 --> 00:40:32,740
We should find the kids
and make sure they're safe.

542
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,377
Them kids are all right, girl.

543
00:40:34,545 --> 00:40:38,743
I feel sorry for trouble
if it runs into them kids.

544
00:40:42,086 --> 00:40:43,348
Hide!

545
00:40:46,624 --> 00:40:48,922
Hey, y'all, wait for me.

546
00:41:13,217 --> 00:41:15,742
Look out! Behind you!

547
00:41:17,088 --> 00:41:18,851
- Run.
- Look at them. Look at them.

548
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:21,651
Where's them cops now?
Put that down.

549
00:41:21,993 --> 00:41:24,484
Thank God they white.

550
00:41:28,065 --> 00:41:29,760
There they are.

551
00:41:31,602 --> 00:41:35,561
Come on, I think they're still
behind us. This way, Richie. Get in.

552
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:39,301
Please, walk to your cars and secure
your seat belts immediately.

553
00:41:39,477 --> 00:41:43,004
Ever hear of the Alamo? Get your
muskets ready, Davy Crockett.

554
00:41:43,181 --> 00:41:45,877
How long could we keep this up?

555
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:49,816
Until BeBe's kids show up again,
and they'll know what to do.

556
00:41:49,987 --> 00:41:53,787
Look out, there's one over there.
Look out behind you.

557
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:59,289
- Oh, my aching old back.
- My glasses.

558
00:42:02,433 --> 00:42:05,834
He's going down the court,
just going...

559
00:42:06,003 --> 00:42:07,664
Boy, you're so crazy.

560
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,637
I ain't lying.
Would you try to stop them?

561
00:42:11,843 --> 00:42:16,041
I'm going to the ladies' room.
I'll be right back.

562
00:42:16,214 --> 00:42:20,241
Don't get lost,
my little chitlin snaps.

563
00:42:26,591 --> 00:42:29,685
Girl, you been walking slow all day.
What's your problem?

564
00:42:29,861 --> 00:42:33,262
My man Robin came over last night.

565
00:42:33,431 --> 00:42:36,059
- You mean Robin Harris?
- Ain't but one.

566
00:42:36,234 --> 00:42:37,496
I got bags under my eyes

567
00:42:37,668 --> 00:42:40,569
big enough to carry $50
worth of groceries.

568
00:42:40,738 --> 00:42:42,672
How come y'all
didn't stay married?

569
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,365
Oh, he's good to me,
but he's so mean to the kids.

570
00:42:45,543 --> 00:42:46,805
- Is he cheap?
- Is he?

571
00:42:46,978 --> 00:42:50,175
He turned Muslim so he wouldn't
have to give Christmas presents.

572
00:42:50,348 --> 00:42:53,317
- That's a damn shame.
- And he's so quick to hit somebody.

573
00:42:53,484 --> 00:42:54,849
Then he don't wanna
pay the dental bill.

574
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:57,886
I don't know what to say.
You shouldn't be with that man.

575
00:42:58,055 --> 00:43:01,616
I know, I shouldn't. But, girl,
I can't help it, because I love him.

576
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:03,851
You love him?

577
00:43:06,464 --> 00:43:11,367
- Girl, I don't believe what you just did.
- Did we psyche her out or what?

578
00:43:11,535 --> 00:43:13,127
- Did you see her face?
- I know!

579
00:43:13,304 --> 00:43:17,365
Girl, I ain't seen nobody that mad
since I saw Robin in divorce court.

580
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:24,712
Hey, sweet thing. Where you been?

581
00:43:24,882 --> 00:43:27,715
Where I been is talking
to some of your friends.

582
00:43:27,885 --> 00:43:30,183
- My friends?
- And where were you last night?

583
00:43:30,354 --> 00:43:32,322
You act like you know.
What's wrong?

584
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:36,187
Don't act like something's wrong with
me. You the one with the problem.

585
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,988
Now, how much time we got
until we meet the kids?

586
00:43:39,163 --> 00:43:42,462
Well, we got just enough time...

587
00:43:43,968 --> 00:43:46,300
- Oh, my God...
- Robikins.

588
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,802
Get away. Get away from here.

589
00:43:48,973 --> 00:43:51,066
Leave. Please leave.

590
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,878
Guess what? We got just enough
time to go check out Futureville.

591
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:02,417
I bet you it ain't got
no black people in it.

592
00:44:02,586 --> 00:44:04,850
- You acting like that didn't happen?
- What?

593
00:44:05,022 --> 00:44:07,752
Oh, I'm sorry, honey,
I thought you was in a downwind.

594
00:44:07,925 --> 00:44:10,553
I had a couple of burritos,
and you know...

595
00:44:10,728 --> 00:44:13,196
Robin, don't try to change the subject.

596
00:44:13,364 --> 00:44:15,457
I knew she wasn't
going to leave me alone.

597
00:44:15,633 --> 00:44:20,263
So I try to figure out what's worse,
telling a pretty lie or the ugly truth.

598
00:44:20,771 --> 00:44:25,367
- Beauty's only skin deep.
- Yeah, but ugly is to the bone.

599
00:44:25,543 --> 00:44:26,976
Amen, brother.

600
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,911
I hate it when a woman says:

601
00:44:35,086 --> 00:44:38,817
Just tell me the truth.
I won't get upset.

602
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:41,584
Because she's lying.
She don't wanna hear the truth.

603
00:44:41,759 --> 00:44:44,819
If you tell her the truth
she's gonna get mad. I told her:

604
00:44:44,996 --> 00:44:47,624
That's my landlady.
The old snaggletoothed heifer.

605
00:44:47,798 --> 00:44:50,232
Spending all my rent
money on that cotton candy

606
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:53,962
when she knows she needs
to be fixing my refrigerator.

607
00:44:56,207 --> 00:45:00,974
Wait, wait. Jamika,
come on, now. Jamika!

608
00:45:05,049 --> 00:45:08,382
Hey. Yo, you always
trying to leave the little O.G.

609
00:45:08,552 --> 00:45:10,918
Hey, man, yo.

610
00:45:12,189 --> 00:45:15,056
Come back here with my brother.

611
00:45:15,226 --> 00:45:17,126
Humans are not allowed here.

612
00:45:17,294 --> 00:45:20,320
Give him back, and we'll leave.
Give my little brother back.

613
00:45:20,498 --> 00:45:22,227
You better not be rolling nowhere
with my brother.

614
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,700
He attacked one of our models.
He will be punished.

615
00:45:26,871 --> 00:45:29,965
He must not know
who he's messing with.

616
00:45:30,574 --> 00:45:34,408
Hey, tin man, haven't you
heard of BeBe's...

617
00:45:59,904 --> 00:46:03,897
Run, Pee Wee,
he's got the scent of your diaper.

618
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,642
What's going on here?

619
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:16,512
Shoo. Move along. Get.

620
00:46:17,054 --> 00:46:22,082
- Hey, you there.
- What do you want?

621
00:46:22,259 --> 00:46:27,390
You're in America, son. That's not
the way we do things around here.

622
00:46:27,565 --> 00:46:32,400
- Every man has a right to a fair trial.
- Word.

623
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:35,266
So how about it?
Give a brother a fair shot.

624
00:46:35,439 --> 00:46:40,274
If my robotic brethren agree,
a trial will commence.

625
00:46:41,645 --> 00:46:44,079
Hear ye, hear ye.

626
00:46:44,248 --> 00:46:49,015
The robots versus Kahlil Wooten.
The charge is assault.

627
00:46:49,186 --> 00:46:51,882
The prosecution
may present their case.

628
00:46:52,056 --> 00:46:54,581
You know, it's been a long time

629
00:46:54,758 --> 00:46:56,885
since I've been
in a courtroom as a lawyer,

630
00:46:57,061 --> 00:47:01,498
but the evidence of this heinous
crime is so irrefutable.

631
00:47:01,665 --> 00:47:03,997
Exhibit one, please.

632
00:47:07,204 --> 00:47:11,334
Now this is videotape from
one of the security cameras

633
00:47:11,509 --> 00:47:14,444
in the Fun World exhibit.

634
00:47:14,612 --> 00:47:17,012
Oh, man, cold busted.

635
00:47:17,181 --> 00:47:21,083
I told you that stupid bad attitude
would get you in trouble, Kahlil.

636
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:26,451
Do me a favor man, Leon,
before they fry me, drop dead.

637
00:47:26,624 --> 00:47:31,357
Any of you who knows the importance
of law and order will vote guilty.

638
00:47:35,032 --> 00:47:40,800
For the defense, Abraham Lincoln.

639
00:47:40,971 --> 00:47:42,939
Don't slip up, Abe.

640
00:47:43,107 --> 00:47:45,667
Pass the mashed potatoes, dear,
will you?

641
00:47:45,843 --> 00:47:48,607
Is this a pork gravy, dear?
Or is this?

642
00:47:48,779 --> 00:47:51,748
Here it comes. I'm just
waiting for her to ask me.

643
00:47:51,916 --> 00:47:55,352
Robin, who was that, really?

644
00:47:56,654 --> 00:48:01,489
You mean the one over there
with the orange perm...

645
00:48:01,659 --> 00:48:04,093
...and the spandex.

646
00:48:04,261 --> 00:48:06,161
That's Dorothea. That's my ex-wife.

647
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:09,026
Lips so big, ChapStick
had to make a spray.

648
00:48:10,834 --> 00:48:14,361
I know I should have told you,
but I'm embarrassed by that girl.

649
00:48:14,538 --> 00:48:17,098
I guess that's why you
only see her at night, huh?

650
00:48:17,274 --> 00:48:20,175
Night? I'm trying not to see her
for the rest of my life!

651
00:48:20,344 --> 00:48:22,403
That's not what I heard.

652
00:48:23,514 --> 00:48:25,379
Sprung a leak, cuz?

653
00:48:25,549 --> 00:48:29,144
What you mean, "heard"?
Did she talk to you or something?

654
00:48:30,454 --> 00:48:33,719
Well, we gonna
settle this now. Right now!

655
00:48:33,891 --> 00:48:36,519
Each of you must ask yourself:

656
00:48:37,094 --> 00:48:43,590
Are we petty, vengeful humans
or logical, moral machines?

657
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:46,031
Then pass judgment.

658
00:48:46,604 --> 00:48:49,539
Your Honor, the defense rests.

659
00:48:49,707 --> 00:48:52,403
What say you all?

660
00:48:52,576 --> 00:48:58,242
Death. Death. Death.

661
00:48:59,383 --> 00:49:02,011
Wait a minute. Listen up.

662
00:49:02,186 --> 00:49:07,021
Oh, no, don't help me, Leon. All they
were gonna do before was kill me.

663
00:49:07,191 --> 00:49:09,386
Ladies and gentlemen of the court

664
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,721
You're about to witness
A brand-new sport

665
00:49:11,895 --> 00:49:14,625
Where you're on the offense
And I'm on the defense

666
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:16,561
So let's see if we can
Make some sense

667
00:49:16,734 --> 00:49:21,694
Kahlil is a rebel without a pause
He's a victim of your unjust laws

668
00:49:21,872 --> 00:49:26,775
Fun World is no real fun for him
It seems so whack, so bland, so grim

669
00:49:26,944 --> 00:49:29,242
Freedom is a concept
Designed for every race

670
00:49:29,413 --> 00:49:31,813
Follow it and Kahlil
Might own this place

671
00:49:31,982 --> 00:49:33,813
He'd change the name
And change the feel

672
00:49:33,984 --> 00:49:36,179
lmagine "Def World"
With your host Kahlil

673
00:49:36,353 --> 00:49:38,878
Where Carter sells peanuts
And Nixon fresh lemonade

674
00:49:39,056 --> 00:49:41,547
And even old Abe
Will sport a hightop fade

675
00:49:41,725 --> 00:49:43,420
Remember every great leader
Broke the rules

676
00:49:43,594 --> 00:49:46,358
Made up by fools
Give Kahlil the tools he needs

677
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:48,862
Freedom
Freedom

678
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:51,263
Freedom

679
00:49:51,435 --> 00:49:53,903
Freedom

680
00:49:56,173 --> 00:49:58,641
Who are y'all to tell me
I ain't civilized

681
00:49:58,809 --> 00:50:00,970
Don't give us laws
Give us the right to live our lives

682
00:50:01,145 --> 00:50:03,340
At least I go out
And get what's coming

683
00:50:03,514 --> 00:50:06,142
Because BeBe's kids
Ain't known for running

684
00:50:06,317 --> 00:50:08,512
So come on down
Even if you're abused

685
00:50:08,686 --> 00:50:10,984
You robots are all right
Until you blow a fuse

686
00:50:11,155 --> 00:50:13,146
Y'all say I'm wild
But I'm only a child

687
00:50:13,324 --> 00:50:17,351
What BeBe's kids really need is
Freedom

688
00:50:17,528 --> 00:50:19,621
Freedom
Freedom

689
00:50:23,233 --> 00:50:24,860
Freedom!

690
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:30,639
Now it's time to rest my case
And get the verdict face to face

691
00:50:30,808 --> 00:50:33,072
Wave your hands so we can see them

692
00:50:33,243 --> 00:50:35,768
Wave your hands
Like you don't need them

693
00:50:35,946 --> 00:50:40,383
If you believe Kahlil is right
Somebody say freedom

694
00:50:58,068 --> 00:51:00,502
Oh, girl, you got to try
on this blush.

695
00:51:00,671 --> 00:51:03,640
I got enough makeup.
Now, you stop it, now. I look good.

696
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:06,901
Yeah, but you got to put these
big red circles on your cheeks.

697
00:51:07,077 --> 00:51:08,510
Make them look like targets.

698
00:51:08,679 --> 00:51:12,376
I don't wanna look like Shirley Temple.
Ain't you done yet? Let's go.

699
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:14,312
In a minute.

700
00:51:17,821 --> 00:51:19,618
Ain't nobody looking at you. Come on.

701
00:51:28,832 --> 00:51:33,030
That's them. I can tell
by them Lee Press-On toenails.

702
00:51:33,203 --> 00:51:37,435
Look who's with her. Old Vivian with
the skippys with the broke-down back.

703
00:51:37,608 --> 00:51:39,007
Give me a break.

704
00:51:42,846 --> 00:51:46,111
I see some women
can't do anything without a man.

705
00:51:46,283 --> 00:51:48,843
Why you lie on me?
Don't you know this kind of game

706
00:51:49,019 --> 00:51:50,953
only brings me and Jamika closer

707
00:51:51,121 --> 00:51:54,488
and guarantees that you and I
never get together again. Never!

708
00:51:54,658 --> 00:51:56,683
For me to lie on you
I'd have to care about you

709
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:59,260
and believe me, I don't give
a damn about y'all.

710
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:02,729
Ain't that a... That's why I wear
my ring on the wrong finger,

711
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,993
because I married the wrong woman.

712
00:52:05,169 --> 00:52:07,694
- Hair look like the back of a toaster.
- Your mama.

713
00:52:07,871 --> 00:52:09,566
- My mama?
- Your whole family.

714
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:13,574
Look at you. Your mama so old,
she was there the first day of slavery.

715
00:52:13,744 --> 00:52:16,076
Your mama so old,
she's older than your grandmama.

716
00:52:16,246 --> 00:52:18,146
Your mama so fat,
she on both sides of the family.

717
00:52:18,315 --> 00:52:21,443
Your mama's so dumb, she thought
a quarterback was a refund.

718
00:52:21,618 --> 00:52:23,347
Ain't that a... Your mama so dumb,

719
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,648
they told her it was chilly outside,
she went and got a bowl.

720
00:52:27,491 --> 00:52:30,654
You ready to go, baby?
Come on, let's get out of here.

721
00:52:30,828 --> 00:52:33,524
I think it's time to flush and leave.

722
00:52:33,697 --> 00:52:36,461
You can have him. I don't have
a problem getting a man.

723
00:52:36,633 --> 00:52:39,500
Well, girlfriend, here's some lotion
for your ashy ankles.

724
00:52:41,638 --> 00:52:44,004
That'll make it even easier.

725
00:52:45,909 --> 00:52:47,171
Your mama so country,

726
00:52:47,344 --> 00:52:50,507
she got in an elevator
and thought it was a mobile home.

727
00:52:52,282 --> 00:52:58,118
You know what that was all
about, right? He still loves you.

728
00:52:58,288 --> 00:53:00,654
Robin, I'm so sorry.

729
00:53:00,824 --> 00:53:04,590
Oh, Jamika, it doesn't really matter,
because I'm with you,

730
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:08,197
and this day turned out to be,
you know, kind of special to me.

731
00:53:08,365 --> 00:53:12,131
Me too. I'm sorry
I put you on trial like that.

732
00:53:12,302 --> 00:53:16,136
Oh, Jamika, you so crazy.

733
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:26,308
- Run!
- Come on, the cops are still after us.

734
00:53:26,483 --> 00:53:30,044
We better get out of here.
Let's go. Let's go!

735
00:53:33,524 --> 00:53:37,984
Now I've got them. Surrender now
and face moderate casualties.

736
00:53:38,161 --> 00:53:42,655
- It's the end of the line for you kids.
- Hey, come on, this way.

737
00:53:46,103 --> 00:53:47,866
Move. Excuse me.
Get out of the way.

738
00:53:48,038 --> 00:53:49,835
Move, man.

739
00:53:51,408 --> 00:53:54,400
Come on, come on.
Let's go, people. Out of our way.

740
00:54:00,217 --> 00:54:01,582
I got...

741
00:54:04,988 --> 00:54:06,956
Oh, no!

742
00:54:12,663 --> 00:54:15,632
It looks like you missed the boat, huh?

743
00:54:17,734 --> 00:54:21,226
- I'll be the captain.
- Oh, no. It's BeBe's kids!

744
00:54:26,543 --> 00:54:29,535
Ahoy, mates. I spot a big old boat

745
00:54:29,713 --> 00:54:33,149
to our starboard side
that's ready to get vicked.

746
00:54:33,317 --> 00:54:35,911
Give me that. Let me see.

747
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,951
They're still after us.
What say you, crew?

748
00:54:40,123 --> 00:54:43,854
- Are you down to take them off?
- Aye, aye!

749
00:54:44,027 --> 00:54:46,393
Bust it, then.

750
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:11,250
As you enjoy
the last cruise on the Titanic

751
00:55:11,421 --> 00:55:15,687
stop by the snack bar for flavor-icious
iceberg pops for you and your family.

752
00:55:15,859 --> 00:55:17,759
We also have delicious popcorn...

753
00:55:19,496 --> 00:55:21,157
Monsieur.

754
00:55:32,943 --> 00:55:36,003
Robin, you are something else.

755
00:55:37,314 --> 00:55:40,647
- Something...
- You so crazy.

756
00:55:45,389 --> 00:55:48,984
Boy, I'm scared of you.
Look at you.

757
00:55:52,462 --> 00:55:54,657
What was that?

758
00:55:54,831 --> 00:55:57,299
I know it's them kids.
I know it's them kids.

759
00:55:57,467 --> 00:56:01,460
If I could just touch
one of them, I would... Hey! Hey!

760
00:56:03,407 --> 00:56:05,500
Robin? Robin?

761
00:56:07,711 --> 00:56:12,148
Oh, my God! The boat! The boat!
Women and children...

762
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:22,014
Now what, captain?

763
00:56:23,927 --> 00:56:25,792
- Ram them.
- All right!

764
00:56:25,962 --> 00:56:29,796
- Come on, we gotta get out of here!
- Abandon ship!

765
00:56:29,966 --> 00:56:33,732
We're experiencing difficulties,
but the snack bar's still open,

766
00:56:33,904 --> 00:56:37,237
where they've got that finger...
They're gonna ram us!

767
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:45,245
We BeBe's kids.
We don't die, we multiply.

768
00:56:45,415 --> 00:56:47,975
- Somebody help me!
- I'm right behind you.

769
00:56:48,151 --> 00:56:49,584
Hey, wait for me.

770
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:57,589
Fun World.

771
00:56:59,429 --> 00:57:02,489
- Robin, wait.
- Oh, no. I had enough of them kids.

772
00:57:02,666 --> 00:57:07,194
I can't be around no bad people.
You know I'm on parole.

773
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:09,634
You ain't on parole.
Let's go get the kids.

774
00:57:09,806 --> 00:57:11,398
I ain't stuttin' those kids.

775
00:57:11,575 --> 00:57:13,941
If you were smart,
you'd come right along with me.

776
00:57:15,045 --> 00:57:18,913
- I'll call for backup!
- Boat 73 going in.

777
00:57:19,349 --> 00:57:22,318
Did you buy your kid
a Nintendo game this Christmas?

778
00:57:22,486 --> 00:57:25,683
Did I buy my kid a Nintendo?
Give me a break, OK, kid?

779
00:57:25,856 --> 00:57:28,848
- I don't think so.
- Look, we were going to, OK?

780
00:57:29,025 --> 00:57:31,050
We were gonna... We were going to.

781
00:57:31,228 --> 00:57:34,356
- What say you, crew? Should I?
- Shark food!

782
00:57:41,371 --> 00:57:43,430
Next.

783
00:57:49,446 --> 00:57:54,406
Don't try to leave them, Robin.
That's why they shot their daddy.

784
00:57:58,555 --> 00:58:00,352
Come on.

785
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:06,119
Get out of the way. Get out of the way.
Get out of the way!

786
00:58:10,734 --> 00:58:13,134
Gotta go. Gotta go.

787
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,945
It's my car. Where's my keys?
Ain't that a... Look out.

788
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:39,721
It ain't time to go.
Are you trying to leave us?

789
00:58:41,798 --> 00:58:44,665
Fun World! Fun World!

790
00:58:44,835 --> 00:58:49,966
- Fun World! Fun World! Fun World!
- Quiet down!

791
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:53,075
Hey, Ma, guess what we did?
We jumped out of a boat,

792
00:58:53,243 --> 00:58:55,336
and then we cut
Tommy Toad's feet off.

793
00:58:55,512 --> 00:58:58,845
Then we took over a pirate ship,
and then we saw another ship...

794
00:58:59,015 --> 00:59:01,848
- Quit talking.
- Fun World.

795
00:59:02,018 --> 00:59:05,044
- Home, blacky.
- Ain't that a...

796
00:59:06,289 --> 00:59:09,224
- You messed up now. That's it.
- Fun World! Fun World!

797
00:59:09,392 --> 00:59:13,089
LaShawn. Girl, have you gone crazy?

798
00:59:17,334 --> 00:59:19,825
What's that funky smell?

799
00:59:20,003 --> 00:59:23,564
Pee Wee, did you go again?

800
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:26,732
What's corn doing on the floor?

801
00:59:41,191 --> 00:59:43,352
I ain't never been glad
to see cops before,

802
00:59:43,526 --> 00:59:44,925
but I was sure happy then.

803
00:59:45,095 --> 00:59:47,290
Happier than a runaway slave,
papers and all.

804
00:59:48,498 --> 00:59:51,956
Help. Help. Help.

805
00:59:54,804 --> 00:59:56,396
These kids are dangerous.

806
00:59:56,573 --> 01:00:02,136
Boy got a knife bigger than Rambo's.
One kid got a Colt longer than Shaft's.

807
01:00:02,979 --> 01:00:04,674
Boo!

808
01:00:05,282 --> 01:00:07,045
Those are BeBe's kids.

809
01:00:17,127 --> 01:00:21,063
I have had it. I am pissed off
to the highest level of pissivity.

810
01:00:21,231 --> 01:00:25,224
Now, I'm taking these kids home now.
Not now, but right now.

811
01:00:25,402 --> 01:00:28,735
- But BeBe isn't home yet.
- No, she's home. I know she's home.

812
01:00:28,905 --> 01:00:32,807
And she's home getting her boots
smoked, just like you could be.

813
01:00:32,976 --> 01:00:35,501
But you want to sit here
and watch these badass kids.

814
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:38,011
If she didn't want to watch them,
she shouldn't have had them.

815
01:00:38,181 --> 01:00:40,115
She didn't have them
by herself, Robin.

816
01:00:40,283 --> 01:00:42,683
What'd you say "Robin" for?
I ain't their daddy.

817
01:00:42,852 --> 01:00:45,412
At least you recognize
that they do have one.

818
01:00:45,588 --> 01:00:48,921
I don't see nobody shaking their heads,
pointing fingers at him.

819
01:00:49,092 --> 01:00:52,061
What you wanna go and point
the finger at Old Slewfoot for?

820
01:00:52,228 --> 01:00:55,391
I thought the devil was through
when he made Rosemary's babies,

821
01:00:55,565 --> 01:01:00,593
but, oh, no,
now we got BeBe's kids.

822
01:01:23,259 --> 01:01:26,820
Now, kids, what do you say
to Mr. Harris for the lovely trip?

823
01:01:26,997 --> 01:01:30,057
Thank you very much.

824
01:01:31,868 --> 01:01:36,271
They didn't wanna go with
four black kids in the first place.

825
01:01:45,115 --> 01:01:47,242
So where we going
next week, Mr. Harris?

826
01:01:47,417 --> 01:01:49,681
Next week? I'll take you
somewhere next week.

827
01:01:49,853 --> 01:01:53,118
I'll take you to a snake pit.
Go, your mother's waiting for you.

828
01:01:57,627 --> 01:01:59,925
Yo, wait up.

829
01:02:01,398 --> 01:02:04,026
Hey, get back here.
Get back here with my stuff.

830
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:08,637
Hey, it better not
be nothing from my crib.

831
01:02:11,207 --> 01:02:13,573
- I better walk them in.
- Let me walk them in,

832
01:02:13,743 --> 01:02:17,509
because I want to give BeBe
a piece of my mind.

833
01:02:22,485 --> 01:02:25,420
I could see why they spent
so much time at Jamika's house.

834
01:02:25,588 --> 01:02:27,920
It looked like they live
next to a crack house.

835
01:02:28,091 --> 01:02:31,390
Try to phone hell
from there, it'd be a local call.

836
01:02:36,266 --> 01:02:38,063
Oh, hey.

837
01:02:55,018 --> 01:02:57,145
Mommy?

838
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,788
The place looked like
MOVE headquarters.

839
01:02:59,956 --> 01:03:01,355
Mommy?

840
01:03:02,258 --> 01:03:05,955
Mama, are you home?

841
01:03:07,764 --> 01:03:10,631
Mom, are you there?

842
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,132
What is this, another unpaid bill?

843
01:03:13,303 --> 01:03:19,208
"Jamika, please give the kids dinner.
I'll be home soon. BeBe."

844
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:21,843
That girl crazy.

845
01:03:27,484 --> 01:03:30,783
Y'all ain't got nothing in here to eat?

846
01:03:43,133 --> 01:03:46,933
Well, here. Here's $10.
Call the pizza man.

847
01:03:47,103 --> 01:03:50,800
He don't come around here no more.

848
01:03:51,875 --> 01:03:55,003
- You leaving?
- Well...

849
01:03:55,178 --> 01:03:57,271
...I'm sure your mother
will be home soon.

850
01:03:57,447 --> 01:03:59,881
Just keep the door locked, all right?

851
01:04:00,049 --> 01:04:03,041
I sure had a good time.

852
01:04:03,887 --> 01:04:06,014
Take care of yourselves.

853
01:04:09,492 --> 01:04:11,016
Bye-bye, y'all.

854
01:04:12,395 --> 01:04:14,693
Bye, Mr. Harris.

855
01:04:43,459 --> 01:04:45,324
Now do you understand?

856
01:04:45,495 --> 01:04:47,690
I understand that BeBe
needs a good realtor.

857
01:04:47,864 --> 01:04:50,059
Those kids don't stand a chance
in that neighborhood.

858
01:04:50,233 --> 01:04:54,636
No, I don't think that neighborhood
stands a chance against BeBe's kids.

859
01:04:54,804 --> 01:04:58,365
Now, I know they have
a behavior problem...

860
01:04:59,108 --> 01:05:00,507
...but they're still kids.

861
01:05:00,677 --> 01:05:04,545
Jamika, I was a kid too.
And I lived like that too.

862
01:05:04,714 --> 01:05:07,877
But I wasn't as bad as those kids.
Nowhere near as bad.

863
01:05:08,051 --> 01:05:12,147
If I got in trouble, my mother would
beat me until my daddy get home.

864
01:05:12,322 --> 01:05:14,119
Then he'd put on that blues record
that skipped.

865
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:16,224
Whup you when I wanna

866
01:05:16,392 --> 01:05:18,519
When I wanna
When I wanna

867
01:05:18,695 --> 01:05:21,459
See, Robin, you making my case.
These kids need...

868
01:05:21,631 --> 01:05:23,223
Need what? A social worker?

869
01:05:23,399 --> 01:05:27,836
I already got a job, and it pays
better benefits than that one.

870
01:05:30,873 --> 01:05:33,501
Oh, you gonna be like that, huh?

871
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,142
That was it.

872
01:05:39,315 --> 01:05:40,976
- That was it?
- Not another word.

873
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:44,017
- You dropped her off?
- She got out, didn't say nothing.

874
01:05:44,187 --> 01:05:46,417
- Well, what did you say?
- Say?

875
01:05:46,589 --> 01:05:49,854
I wasn't gonna play myself,
if she was gonna play high post.

876
01:05:50,026 --> 01:05:53,052
- Oh, man.
- Oh, man, nothing.

877
01:05:54,597 --> 01:05:59,557
Say, man, you did the right thing
leaving them kids.

878
01:05:59,736 --> 01:06:02,398
They were nothing but trouble.

879
01:06:02,572 --> 01:06:08,977
Listen, you don't need
to look out for nobody but yourself.

880
01:06:09,145 --> 01:06:13,809
That's why I am where I am today.

881
01:06:22,592 --> 01:06:24,753
What am I doing?
I gotta go get those kids.

882
01:06:24,927 --> 01:06:26,792
I can't just leave them there.

883
01:06:30,433 --> 01:06:31,627
Jamika?

884
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:36,568
- I think I judged...
- Well, wait. Hold up.

885
01:06:36,739 --> 01:06:38,730
We both been under a lot of stress

886
01:06:38,908 --> 01:06:42,309
and said some things
we didn't really mean.

887
01:06:42,478 --> 01:06:44,207
Well, I...

888
01:06:45,848 --> 01:06:47,611
Well...

889
01:06:51,521 --> 01:06:53,716
Hey, now.

890
01:06:57,026 --> 01:07:02,328
- Your mama kind of like him, huh?
- Yeah, and I kind of like him too.

891
01:07:03,866 --> 01:07:06,027
It looks like cooties is catching.

892
01:07:06,202 --> 01:07:07,635
Come here. I'll show you.

893
01:07:07,804 --> 01:07:12,741
Go ahead, beat him like he owe
you money. I like LaShawn, boy.

894
01:07:12,909 --> 01:07:16,970
Robin, the kids really do appreciate
what you've done for them today.

895
01:07:17,146 --> 01:07:18,408
Well, you know.

896
01:07:18,581 --> 01:07:21,982
They just have their own way
of showing it.

897
01:07:25,221 --> 01:07:27,314
Hey, what's this?

898
01:07:29,892 --> 01:07:33,828
Hey, Slim, we saved you a slice.

899
01:07:35,865 --> 01:07:40,063
So where we going next, Mr. Harris?
How about Las Vegas?

900
01:07:40,236 --> 01:07:42,363
Vegas? We ain't going to no Vegas.

901
01:07:42,538 --> 01:07:44,870
You're barely getting a ride
to the end of the block,

902
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:49,705
so just sit back, buckle up, be happy,
and check Pee Wee's drawers.

903
01:07:55,685 --> 01:07:57,983
I don't know how Jamika
talked me into coming.

904
01:07:58,154 --> 01:08:02,818
- We got 14 cents between all of us.
- Robin, it's gonna be OK.

905
01:08:02,992 --> 01:08:05,859
This ain't a... You know
them kids don't know how to act.

906
01:08:06,028 --> 01:08:12,627
- The circus can't train them kids.
- Look at those sweet little faces.

907
01:08:12,802 --> 01:08:16,431
I ain't having it. I'm like Marvin Gaye.
I want to know what's going on.

908
01:08:16,606 --> 01:08:20,372
- Oh, no, it's BeBe's kids!
- Ain't that a...

909
01:08:20,543 --> 01:08:23,205
- Robin.
- What did you all do now?

910
01:08:23,379 --> 01:08:25,904
I ain't never been here,
huh, LaShawn?

911
01:08:26,082 --> 01:08:29,142
Oh, yeah, let me up out of here, baby.

912
01:08:29,318 --> 01:08:32,219
Vegas at last.
Now, this is my kind of town.

913
01:08:32,388 --> 01:08:35,414
Pour one for the poor one.
Six-eight, running mates.

914
01:08:35,591 --> 01:08:41,689
Box cars, don't stretch me out, now.
Las Vegas in effect, baby.

915
01:08:41,864 --> 01:08:44,890
- Pee Wee!
