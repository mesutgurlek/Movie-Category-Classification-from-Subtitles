1
00:06:43,234 --> 00:06:49,234
Captain Walker didn't come home.

2
00:06:49,235 --> 00:06:54,235
His unborn child will never know him

3
00:06:54,236 --> 00:06:59,236
We believe him missing with a number of men,

4
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:04,237
Don't expect to see him again

5
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,240
It's a boy, Mrs. Walker, it's a boy

6
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:33,241
It's a boy, Mrs. Walker, it's a boy

7
00:07:37,242 --> 00:07:43,242
A son! A son!

8
00:07:51,243 --> 00:07:57,243
A son!

9
00:07:57,244 --> 00:08:03,244
Hear the joyful celebrations in the street!

10
00:08:04,245 --> 00:08:10,245
It's a boy born on this first day of peace!

11
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:23,246
We've won! A son! We've won!

12
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:07,072
I'm your friendly green coat,
And I welcome you to Bernie's Holiday Camp!

13
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:12,073
G'day, and you'll be happy,

14
00:10:12,074 --> 00:10:16,074
And it's Bernie you will thank.

15
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:22,075
You must be little Tommy.
Well, call me Uncle Frank.

16
00:10:27,245 --> 00:10:31,972
Welcome you too, Mrs. Walker,
Here you'll always find a helping hand!

17
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:39,377
The camp with the extras

18
00:10:39,378 --> 00:10:45,378
If you come to Bernie's,
You might think you're in Heaven!

19
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:34,517
Here we have the winner, folks!
Have you ever seen a lovelier pair?

20
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:41,544
What a shapely ankle!
What a perfect shin!

21
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:46,545
If you could feel this silken thigh,
You'd know who has to win!

22
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:55,979
If you could feel this silken thigh,
You'd know.

23
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,704
You don't know how much I've missed

24
00:12:14,705 --> 00:12:19,705
To feel a man again,
To dance, to kiss.

25
00:12:27,728 --> 00:12:31,609
Your eyes reveal: You're lonely.

26
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,610
This evening must pass slowly.

27
00:12:34,611 --> 00:12:37,611
Until we're one, my heart won't rest.

28
00:12:40,825 --> 00:12:44,735
Will Tommy share our happiness?

29
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:07,587
I'll be more than an uncle;
I'll be just like a Dad!

30
00:13:08,675 --> 00:13:14,675
I will be a green coat too,
And when I'm big, I'll own a Holiday Camp!

31
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:20,744
A camp with a difference,
Always be good weather.

32
00:13:22,407 --> 00:13:26,478
When you come to Tommy's,
The holiday's forever!

33
00:13:58,826 --> 00:14:04,826
I'm glad you like your Uncle Frank.
He'll surely love you too, just like a Dad

34
00:14:15,683 --> 00:14:21,683
He's very nice, I think.
Did he fight in the War?

35
00:14:55,632 --> 00:15:00,047
Gotta feeling '51 is gonna be a good year,

36
00:15:01,795 --> 00:15:06,901
Especially if you and me see it out together.

37
00:15:09,047 --> 00:15:12,501
So you think that '51 is gonna be a good year.

38
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:18,809
We'll marry now and see it out together.

39
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:26,093
I have no reason to be over-optimistic,

40
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:33,810
But somehow when you smile
I can brave bad weather.

41
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:35,124
What about the boy?
What about the boy?

42
00:16:35,637 --> 00:16:39,936
What about the boy, he saw it all!

43
00:16:40,527 --> 00:16:44,527
You didn't hear it, you didn't see it!
You won't say nothin' to no one,

44
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,725
Ever in your life. You never heard it.
How absurd it all seems, without any proof

45
00:16:48,846 --> 00:16:52,730
You didn't hear it, you didn't see it!
You won't say nothin' to no one,

46
00:16:52,964 --> 00:16:55,958
Ever in your life.
You never heard it.

47
00:16:57,453 --> 00:17:02,252
How absurd it all seems, without any proof!

48
00:17:08,632 --> 00:17:13,056
You won't say nothin' to no one,
Never tell a soul what you know is the truth!

49
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,294
Now he is deaf.
Now he is dumb

50
00:17:30,688 --> 00:17:34,350
Now he is blind.
The guilty are safe,

51
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,805
But always accused by his empty eyes.

52
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,746
Nothing to say, Nothing
to hear, And nothing to see

53
00:17:52,747 --> 00:17:57,747
Each sensation makes a note in his symphony.

54
00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:06,498
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go

55
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:12,499
Come on the amazing journey,
And learn all you should know.

56
00:18:17,212 --> 00:18:22,975
A vague haze of delirium creeps up on him.
Soaring and flying images spin.

57
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:28,976
He is your leader, he is your guide.
On the amazing journey,

58
00:19:15,076 --> 00:19:20,109
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.

59
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:25,110
Come on the amazing journey,
And learn all you should know

60
00:19:30,608 --> 00:19:36,337
His eyes are the eyes that transmit all he knows,
The truth burns so bright it can melt winter snows.

61
00:19:36,338 --> 00:19:40,338
A towering shadow, so black and so high,.

62
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:44,339
A white sun burning the earth and the sky.

63
00:21:16,618 --> 00:21:22,606
Did you ever see the faces
Of the children, they get so excited

64
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:30,906
Waking up on Christmas morning
Hours before the winter sun's ignited

65
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:36,691
They believe in dreams and all they mean,
Including Heaven's generosity.

66
00:21:37,692 --> 00:21:43,692
Peeping 'round the door to see what
Parcels are for free in curiosity.

67
00:21:52,321 --> 00:21:58,321
He doesn't know who Jesus was,
Or what praying is.

68
00:21:58,322 --> 00:22:04,322
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave?

69
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:29,563
Tommy, can you hear me?
Tommy, can you hear me?

70
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:04,376
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me.

71
00:23:31,724 --> 00:23:35,726
Surrounded by his friends,
He sits so silently and

72
00:23:35,727 --> 00:23:40,727
Unaware of anything.
Playing poxy pinball, picks his nose

73
00:23:40,728 --> 00:23:44,728
He smiles, he cries,
He pokes his tongue at everything

74
00:23:44,729 --> 00:23:45,729
I believe in love,

75
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:51,730
But how can men who've never seen light
Be enlightened?

76
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:58,731
Only if he's cured
Will his spirit's future level

77
00:23:58,732 --> 00:24:00,732
Ever heighten.

78
00:24:01,847 --> 00:24:04,383
And Tommy doesn't know what day it is.

79
00:24:04,384 --> 00:24:10,384
He doesn't know who Jesus was,
Or what praying is.

80
00:24:11,714 --> 00:24:17,714
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave?

81
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:37,822
You talk about your woman,
I wish you could see mine.

82
00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:54,122
Everytime she starts to lovin',
She brings eyesight to the blind.

83
00:26:04,465 --> 00:26:10,465
You know, her daddy gave her magic.
I can tell by the way she walks.

84
00:26:18,688 --> 00:26:23,679
Everytime she starts to shake,
The dumb begin to talk,

85
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:11,854
She's got the power to heal you,
Never fear.

86
00:27:20,813 --> 00:27:26,264
Just one word from her lips,
And the deaf can hear.

87
00:31:54,255 --> 00:31:59,593
If your child ain't all he should be now,
This girl will put him right.

88
00:31:59,594 --> 00:32:05,594
I'll show him what he could be now,
Just give me one night!

89
00:32:09,008 --> 00:32:15,008
I'm the Gypsy, the Acid Queen,
Pay me before I start.

90
00:32:15,188 --> 00:32:21,188
I'm the Gypsy, and I'm guaranteed
To mend his aching heart.

91
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:37,655
Give us a room, close the door.
Leave us for a while.

92
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:43,656
Your boy won't be a boy no more;
Young, but not a child!

93
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:49,657
'Cause I'm the Gypsy, the Acid Queen,
Pay me before I start.

94
00:32:49,658 --> 00:32:55,658
The Gypsy, and I'm guaranteed
To tear your soul apart.

95
00:33:17,703 --> 00:33:23,076
Gather your wits and hold on fast,
Your mind must learn to roam.

96
00:33:23,077 --> 00:33:29,077
Just as the Gypsy Queen must do,
You're gonna hit the road!

97
00:35:04,761 --> 00:35:10,020
My work is done, now look at him.
He's never been more alive.

98
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:16,021
His head it shakes, his fingers clutch.
Watch his body writhe!

99
00:39:54,884 --> 00:40:00,884
Do you think it's alright
To leave the boy with Cousin Kevin?

100
00:40:01,257 --> 00:40:06,257
There's something 'bout him I
Don't really like.

101
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:17,535
I think it's alright,
Yes, I think it's alright.

102
00:40:26,814 --> 00:40:32,814
We're on our own, cousin.
All alone, cousin.

103
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:38,844
Let's think of a game to play
Now the grownups have all gone away

104
00:40:38,845 --> 00:40:44,845
You won't be much fun,
Being blind, deaf and dumb,

105
00:40:44,846 --> 00:40:50,846
But I've no one to play with today.
Do you know how to play Hide and Seek?

106
00:40:50,847 --> 00:40:55,847
To find me, it would take you a week!

107
00:40:55,848 --> 00:41:00,848
You won't go anywhere.
There's a lot I can do to a freak!

108
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:06,849
How would you feel if I turned on the bath,
Ducked your head under and started to laugh?

109
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:15,850
Maybe a cigarette burn on your arm
Will change your expression to one of alarm.

110
00:41:30,985 --> 00:41:36,985
I'm the school bully,
The classroom cheat,

111
00:41:37,514 --> 00:41:43,514
The nastiest play-friend
You ever could meet.

112
00:41:44,515 --> 00:41:50,515
I'll put glass in your dinner,
and spikes in your seat.

113
00:41:55,543 --> 00:42:01,543
I'll drag you around
By a lock of your hair,

114
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:07,730
And give you a push
At the top of the stair!

115
00:42:07,731 --> 00:42:13,731
What would you do if I
Shut you outside

116
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:20,732
To stand in the rain and
Catch cold, so you'd die?

117
00:42:23,733 --> 00:42:29,733
I'm the school bully,
The classroom cheat,

118
00:42:29,734 --> 00:42:35,734
The nastiest play-friend
You ever could meet.

119
00:42:36,735 --> 00:42:42,735
I'll stick pins in your fingers,
And tread on your feet.

120
00:42:49,178 --> 00:42:55,053
We're on our own, cousin.
All alone, cousin.

121
00:42:55,054 --> 00:43:01,054
We've thought of some nice games to play
While the grownups has all gone away.

122
00:43:02,055 --> 00:43:08,055
You weren't too much fun,
'Cause you're blind, deaf and dumb,

123
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:11,065
But I'd no one to play with today.

124
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:06,666
Do you think it's alright
To leave the boy with Uncle Ernie?

125
00:44:06,774 --> 00:44:12,774
Do you think it's alright?
He's had a few too many tonight

126
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,481
Yes, I think it's alright,
Yes, I think it's alright.

127
00:44:45,255 --> 00:44:49,638
I'm your wicked Uncle Ernie;
I'm glad you won't see or hear me,

128
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:54,639
As I fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about.

129
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:00,640
Your mother left me here to mind you,
And I'm doing exactly what I bleedin' well want to,

130
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:14,120
Down with your bedclothes,
Up with your nightshirt.

131
00:45:14,121 --> 00:45:20,121
Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about.

132
00:45:21,122 --> 00:45:27,122
You won't "shite"
As I fiddle "abite. "

133
00:47:04,063 --> 00:47:09,860
Do you think it's alright
Leaving Tommy by the mirror?

134
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:15,861
You would think he had sight,
Been staring half the night.

135
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:24,106
Yes, I think it's alright,
Yes, I think it's alright

136
00:51:24,683 --> 00:51:29,863
Extra, extra, pinball bonanza!
Deaf dumb and blind kid makes the big game!

137
00:51:29,864 --> 00:51:34,864
Saturday, the final, he faces the champ!
Extra, extra, extra!

138
00:51:34,865 --> 00:51:40,865
Pinball, the big time, a million in hand!
You can rule the world from a yacht in the bay!

139
00:51:40,866 --> 00:51:44,866
Champagne flowing, you're popular, man!
Pinball, let's play!

140
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:47,701
Tommy keeps on winning,
He's a millionaire,

141
00:51:47,702 --> 00:51:51,702
Momma's got a brand new Cadillac.
Hurry to the show,

142
00:51:51,703 --> 00:51:54,703
We're nearly on the air!
Extra, extra!

143
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,571
Ever since I was a young boy,
I've played the silver ball.

144
00:52:30,572 --> 00:52:33,572
From SoHo down to Brighton,
I must have played them all.

145
00:52:33,573 --> 00:52:36,573
But I ain't seen nothin' like him
In any amusement hall.

146
00:52:36,574 --> 00:52:41,574
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.

147
00:52:49,037 --> 00:52:51,916
He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.

148
00:52:51,917 --> 00:52:54,917
Feelin' all the bumpers,
Always playin' clean.

149
00:52:54,918 --> 00:52:58,918
He plays by intuition.
The digit counters fall.

150
00:52:58,919 --> 00:53:02,919
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.

151
00:53:09,919 --> 00:53:13,030
He's a pinball wizard,
There has to be a twist.

152
00:53:13,031 --> 00:53:16,031
A pinball wizard,

153
00:53:16,032 --> 00:53:20,032
Got such a supple wrist!

154
00:53:21,266 --> 00:53:23,072
How do you think he does it?

155
00:53:23,073 --> 00:53:24,073
I don't know!

156
00:53:24,074 --> 00:53:25,574
What makes him so good?

157
00:53:27,919 --> 00:53:31,029
Well, he ain't got no distractions,
Can't hear no buzzers and bells.

158
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:34,030
Don't see lights a-flashing,
He plays by sense of smell.

159
00:53:34,031 --> 00:53:37,031
Always has a replay,
Never tilts at all,

160
00:53:37,032 --> 00:53:42,032
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.

161
00:53:49,317 --> 00:53:52,312
He can't beat me now,
I've always been the champ!

162
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:56,313
I know it's a trick!
No freak's gonna beat my hand!

163
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,303
He can beat my favorite table,
He can beat the best.

164
00:54:24,304 --> 00:54:27,304
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

165
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:30,305
He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I've never seen them fall.

166
00:54:30,306 --> 00:54:35,306
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.

167
00:54:49,717 --> 00:54:52,902
He's a pinball wizard
There has to be a twist.

168
00:54:52,903 --> 00:54:55,903
A pinball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist!

169
00:55:03,696 --> 00:55:06,961
He's a pinball wizard
His score shoots even more

170
00:55:06,962 --> 00:55:11,962
A pinball wizard,
The world's new pinball lord!

171
00:55:15,452 --> 00:55:19,405
He's scoring more!
He's scoring more

172
00:55:49,406 --> 00:55:55,406
thought I was the Bally table king,
But I just handed my pinball crown to him.

173
00:57:55,632 --> 00:58:01,632
It rains champagne!
A son was born again!

174
00:58:01,973 --> 00:58:07,973
A genius untamed!
A life of wealth and fame, wealth and fame!

175
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:21,534
Champagne flowing down just like rain,
Caviar breakfasts every day.

176
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:28,679
Merchant banks and yachts and...
Servants and cars and private sand.

177
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:36,680
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me.

178
00:59:07,581 --> 00:59:13,581
They flock in, thousands strong.
We'll just play along.

179
00:59:13,877 --> 00:59:19,877
A million in reserve.
For love, a just deserve, just deserve!

180
00:59:27,374 --> 00:59:33,374
Birds and flowers and peacock's wings,
Sequined gowns and birds that sing!

181
00:59:34,169 --> 00:59:40,169
Private planes and fishing lanes.
Bigger crowds and bigger, bigger, bigger takes.

182
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:49,170
But what's it all worth?

183
00:59:56,747 --> 01:00:02,747
What's it all worth when my son is blind?
He can't hear the music nor enjoy what I'm buying.

184
01:00:03,388 --> 01:00:09,388
His life is worthless, affecting mine.
I'd pay any price to drive his plight from my mind!

185
01:03:38,134 --> 01:03:42,320
There's a man I've found
Could bring us all joy!

186
01:03:42,321 --> 01:03:47,011
There's a doctor I've found can cure the boy!
A doctor I've found can cure the boy!

187
01:03:47,046 --> 01:03:51,767
There's a man I've found could remove his sorrow,
He lives in this town, let's see him tomorrow,

188
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:23,103
He seems to be completely unreceptive.
The tests I gave him showed no sense at all.

189
01:04:24,474 --> 01:04:30,474
His eyes react to light; the dials detect it.
He hears but cannot answer to your call.

190
01:05:10,895 --> 01:05:16,895
There is no chance, no untried operation.
All hope lies with him and none with me.

191
01:05:18,074 --> 01:05:24,074
Imagine though the shock from isolation,
When he suddenly can hear and speak and see.

192
01:06:08,688 --> 01:06:12,418
His eyes can see,
His ears can hear, his lips speak.

193
01:06:12,419 --> 01:06:16,419
All the time the needles flick and rock.

194
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:22,420
No machine can give the kind of stimulation,
Needed to remove his inner block.

195
01:06:31,066 --> 01:06:37,066
I often wonder what it is he's feeling.
Has he ever heard a word I've said?

196
01:06:38,706 --> 01:06:44,706
Look at him, now in the mirror dreaming.
What is happening in his head?

197
01:06:52,713 --> 01:06:58,713
What is happening in his head?
Oooooh, I wish I knew, I wish I knew.

198
01:07:38,866 --> 01:07:43,780
Tommy, can you see me?
Can I help to cheer you?

199
01:07:43,781 --> 01:07:48,781
Tommy, can you hear me?
Can you feel me near you?

200
01:07:48,782 --> 01:07:54,782
Oooh, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

201
01:08:57,225 --> 01:09:01,334
You don't answer my call
With even a nod or a twitch

202
01:09:01,335 --> 01:09:05,335
But you gaze at your own reflection!

203
01:09:05,336 --> 01:09:09,336
You don't seem to see me
But I think you can see yourself.

204
01:09:09,337 --> 01:09:14,337
How can the mirror affect you?

205
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:20,236
Can you hear me
Or do I surmise

206
01:09:20,237 --> 01:09:24,237
That you fear me can you feel my temper

207
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:30,238
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise,

208
01:09:39,011 --> 01:09:44,270
Do you hear or fear or
Do I smash the mirror?

209
01:10:24,655 --> 01:10:30,655
I'm free - I'm free,

210
01:10:35,211 --> 01:10:40,436
And freedom tastes of reality!

211
01:10:42,097 --> 01:10:47,240
I'm free - I'm free,

212
01:10:49,546 --> 01:10:54,345
And I'm waiting for you to follow me.

213
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:59,442
If I told you what it takes
To reach the highest high

214
01:10:59,443 --> 01:11:03,443
You'd laugh and say "Nothing's that simple. "

215
01:11:03,444 --> 01:11:05,444
But you've been told many times before

216
01:11:05,445 --> 01:11:07,445
Messiahs pointed to the door

217
01:11:07,446 --> 01:11:12,446
And no one had the guts to leave the temple!

218
01:11:29,831 --> 01:11:35,477
I'm free - I'm free

219
01:11:37,415 --> 01:11:42,329
And I'm waiting for you to follow me.

220
01:12:46,248 --> 01:12:52,200
Tommy, can you hear me?
Tommy, can you hear me?

221
01:13:44,689 --> 01:13:50,689
Mother, Father.
Touch me, feel me.

222
01:13:53,017 --> 01:13:55,398
Who am I, where did I come from?

223
01:13:55,399 --> 01:13:59,399
Have you known me, have you seen me?

224
01:14:01,166 --> 01:14:05,697
You're a hero! You are famous!
You're a champion of the young!

225
01:14:05,698 --> 01:14:10,698
You are rich, but it's so absurd to try
To explain all the things you've done.

226
01:14:10,699 --> 01:14:16,699
You're a god, and you're loved;
Thousands watch you play

227
01:14:16,969 --> 01:14:22,228
Pinball! It's a fever!
And you're the master of the game!

228
01:14:22,376 --> 01:14:28,376
And now that you're whole,
You'll be champion of their very souls.

229
01:14:33,077 --> 01:14:37,146
Yes, I'm healed!
Delivered from silent darkness.

230
01:14:37,147 --> 01:14:42,147
No more locked doors
Or stifled screams.

231
01:14:42,148 --> 01:14:48,148
Pinball! What I see now before me

232
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:55,002
Is far beyond the game,
Beyond your wildest dreams!

233
01:15:00,521 --> 01:15:05,472
Those who love me
Have a higher path to follow now

234
01:15:06,503 --> 01:15:10,957
And you, dear mother, too
Must be prepared!

235
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:07,873
Extra, extra, read all about it!
Pinball Wizard in a miracle cure!

236
01:16:07,874 --> 01:16:11,874
Extra, extra, read all about it!
Extra, Extra!

237
01:16:13,457 --> 01:16:17,909
Right now, right now, story and pictures
Pinball bonanza, a mother's joy!

238
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:20,910
...to show times, lessons and actors.

239
01:16:38,502 --> 01:16:42,955
Outside the house Mr. Simpson announced
That Sally couldn't go to the meeting.

240
01:16:42,956 --> 01:16:47,956
He went on cleaning his black Rolls Royce
And she ran inside weeping.

241
01:16:50,644 --> 01:16:55,712
She got to her room and tears splashed the picture
Of the new Messiah.

242
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:01,312
She picked up a book of her father's life
And threw it on the fire!

243
01:17:03,527 --> 01:17:06,215
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart

244
01:17:06,216 --> 01:17:09,216
That she and Tommy were worlds apart,

245
01:17:11,993 --> 01:17:16,256
But her mother said, "Never mind, your part...

246
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:19,257
Is to be what you'll be. "

247
01:17:27,514 --> 01:17:32,429
The theme of the sermon was come unto me,
Love will find a way,

248
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:37,430
So Sally decided to ignore her dad,
And sneak out anyway!

249
01:17:37,431 --> 01:17:42,431
She spent all afternoon getting ready,
Decided she'd try to touch him,

250
01:17:42,432 --> 01:17:47,432
Maybe he'd see that she was free
And talk to her this Sunday.

251
01:17:52,893 --> 01:17:55,121
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart

252
01:17:55,122 --> 01:17:58,122
That she and Tommy were worlds apart,

253
01:18:01,801 --> 01:18:03,797
But her mother said, "Never mind, your part...

254
01:18:03,798 --> 01:18:05,798
Is to be what you'll be. "

255
01:18:19,325 --> 01:18:24,276
She arrived at six and the place was swinging
To gospel music by nine.

256
01:18:24,277 --> 01:18:29,277
Group after group appeared on the stage
And Sally just sat there crying.

257
01:18:29,278 --> 01:18:34,278
She bit her nails looking pretty as a picture
Right in the very front row

258
01:18:34,279 --> 01:18:39,279
And then one of the people came on stage
And shouted, "Here we go!"

259
01:18:42,074 --> 01:18:46,872
The crowd went crazy as Tommy hit the stage!

260
01:18:46,873 --> 01:18:52,873
Little Sally got lost as the police bossed
The crowd back in a rage!

261
01:18:56,496 --> 01:18:59,940
Your happy welcome is like a favor
I must now return.

262
01:19:01,405 --> 01:19:06,128
The darkness of my childhood past
And flames of blood now burn.

263
01:19:06,129 --> 01:19:11,129
The pinball game I play so well
Reflects a way of life.

264
01:19:11,399 --> 01:19:16,466
This meeting is just another game;
Let's play to win, tonight!

265
01:19:18,966 --> 01:19:21,156
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart

266
01:19:21,157 --> 01:19:24,157
That she and Tommy were worlds apart

267
01:19:27,784 --> 01:19:29,590
But her mother said, "Never mind, your part...

268
01:19:29,591 --> 01:19:31,591
Is to be what you'll be. "

269
01:19:42,564 --> 01:19:47,401
Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down,
Mingling with her tears.

270
01:19:47,402 --> 01:19:52,402
Try to walk the path I walked,
Never mind the pain and fear.

271
01:19:52,403 --> 01:19:57,403
Each one of you has freedom
In your heart without my grace.

272
01:19:57,404 --> 01:20:03,404
Let me see you raise your hands
See joy upon your face!

273
01:20:05,492 --> 01:20:10,177
The crowd went crazy
As Tommy left the stage!

274
01:20:10,178 --> 01:20:15,178
Little Sally was lost for the price of a touch

275
01:20:15,179 --> 01:20:19,179
And a gash across her face,
her pretty face! Ooooh.

276
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:22,180
Sixteen stitches put her right and her Dad said,

277
01:20:22,181 --> 01:20:24,681
"Don't say I didn't warn yer. "

278
01:20:24,682 --> 01:20:30,682
Sally got married to a rock musician
She met in California.

279
01:20:34,548 --> 01:20:38,963
Tommy always talks about the day
The disciples all went wild!

280
01:20:38,964 --> 01:20:44,964
Sally still carries a scar on her cheek
To remind her of his smile.

281
01:21:46,558 --> 01:21:49,707
While Tommy flies, the world is turning.

282
01:21:49,708 --> 01:21:53,708
Life goes on for you and me

283
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:58,752
Our chief concern is money earning,

284
01:21:58,753 --> 01:22:03,753
Why can't someone set us free?

285
01:22:08,686 --> 01:22:14,686
Can't you feel him?
Can't you feel him?

286
01:23:27,493 --> 01:23:33,060
You'll feel me coming
A new vibration

287
01:23:33,061 --> 01:23:39,061
From afar you'll see me
I'm a sensation.

288
01:23:49,821 --> 01:23:55,821
I overwhelm as I approach you
Make your lungs hold breath inside!

289
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:04,720
Lovers break caresses for me
Love enhanced when I've gone by.

290
01:24:16,229 --> 01:24:22,229
They worship me and all I touch
Hazy eyed they catch my glance,

291
01:24:25,189 --> 01:24:31,189
Pleasant shudders shake their senses
My warm momentum throws their stance.

292
01:24:36,288 --> 01:24:41,817
You'll feel me coming
A new vibration

293
01:24:41,818 --> 01:24:46,818
From afar you'll see me
I'm a sensation.

294
01:24:52,099 --> 01:24:56,937
Soon you'll see me can't you feel me
I'm coming...

295
01:24:58,021 --> 01:25:02,898
Send your troubles dancing I know the answer
I'm coming...

296
01:25:07,892 --> 01:25:10,275
I'm a sensation.

297
01:25:30,145 --> 01:25:36,140
I leave a trail of rooted people
Mesmerised by just the sight,

298
01:25:38,812 --> 01:25:44,812
The few I touched now are disciples
Love as One I Am the Light...

299
01:26:07,222 --> 01:26:13,222
Come to my house,
Be one of the comfortable people.

300
01:26:16,405 --> 01:26:21,552
Come to this house, We're
drinking all night, Never sleeping.

301
01:26:25,891 --> 01:26:29,346
Milkman come in!
And you, baker,

302
01:26:29,613 --> 01:26:33,913
Little old lady, welcome,
And you, shoemaker.

303
01:26:35,996 --> 01:26:41,996
Come to this house,
Into this house!

304
01:26:45,961 --> 01:26:51,451
Come to this house,
Be one of us.

305
01:26:54,721 --> 01:27:00,640
Make this your house,
Be one of us.

306
01:27:04,019 --> 01:27:07,512
You can help
To collect some more in.

307
01:27:07,513 --> 01:27:11,513
Young and old people,
Let's get them all in.

308
01:27:26,458 --> 01:27:28,839
Ask along that man with a big red carnation

309
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:31,840
Bring every single person
From Victoria Station.

310
01:27:31,841 --> 01:27:37,841
Go into that hospital,
And bring the nurses and patients.

311
01:27:37,842 --> 01:27:42,842
Everybody go home and fetch their relations.

312
01:27:43,627 --> 01:27:48,887
Come to this house,
Be one of the comfortable people.

313
01:27:52,681 --> 01:27:58,593
Lovely bright home,
We're drinking all night never sleeping.

314
01:28:01,971 --> 01:28:04,967
Hullo, Tommy, there's more at the door.

315
01:28:08,248 --> 01:28:12,357
There's more at the door.
There's more at the door.

316
01:28:22,753 --> 01:28:26,784
We need more room,
Build an extension.

317
01:28:26,785 --> 01:28:31,785
A colorful palace,
Spare no expense, now!

318
01:28:41,025 --> 01:28:47,025
Come to me now!
Come to me now!

319
01:29:21,166 --> 01:29:27,166
To raise your weary spirits high,
My son will teach your silent hearts

320
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:31,790
To talk!

321
01:29:35,854 --> 01:29:41,854
Every home will have his picture.
Pilgrims all will touch his hand.

322
01:29:44,167 --> 01:29:50,167
Pinball tables, gold and silver,
Altars to the Master's plan!

323
01:29:54,571 --> 01:30:00,571
Rio, Paris, New York, London.
Moscow, Peking, Tokyo, the world

324
01:30:09,931 --> 01:30:15,931
A Tommy Camp in every city,
Millions flocking in like sheep.

325
01:30:16,266 --> 01:30:22,266
What they want ain't cheap, 's a pity.
But who am I to upset their dreams?

326
01:33:23,057 --> 01:33:27,977
These pricy gips don't teach us!
Your freedom doesn't reach us!

327
01:33:29,348 --> 01:33:35,298
Enlightenment escapes us!
Awareness doesn't shape us!

328
01:33:35,956 --> 01:33:41,062
How can all this trvia
Take us to the goal you reached?

329
01:33:42,805 --> 01:33:48,443
We came here to be like you,
To find the world you've reached

330
01:33:50,555 --> 01:33:56,555
These pricy gips don't teach us!
Your freedom doesn't reach us!

331
01:34:07,074 --> 01:34:10,722
How can all this trvia
Take us to the goal you reached?

332
01:34:11,239 --> 01:34:17,036
We came here to be like you,
To find the world you've reached!

333
01:34:25,419 --> 01:34:30,876
Welcome to the camp!
I guess you all know why we're here.

334
01:34:31,933 --> 01:34:37,503
My name is Tommy, and I became aware this year.

335
01:34:37,504 --> 01:34:43,504
If you want to follow me,
You've got to play pinball.

336
01:34:43,505 --> 01:34:49,505
So put in your earplugs,
Put on your eyeshades,

337
01:34:49,506 --> 01:34:54,506
You know where to put the cork!

338
01:34:56,437 --> 01:35:01,430
Hey you, gettin' drunk,
So sorry, I've got you sussed.

339
01:35:01,431 --> 01:35:07,431
Hey, you, smokin' mother nature,
You missed the bus.

340
01:35:07,432 --> 01:35:13,432
Hey, hung up old Mister Normal,
Don't try to gain my trust.

341
01:35:14,433 --> 01:35:19,433
'Cos you ain't gonna follow me
Any of those ways,

342
01:35:19,434 --> 01:35:22,434
Although you think you must!

343
01:35:32,871 --> 01:35:38,246
Now you can't hear me,
Your ears are truly sealed!

344
01:35:39,993 --> 01:35:45,138
You can't speak either,
'Cos your mouth is filled

345
01:35:45,139 --> 01:35:51,139
You can't see nothing,
And pinball completes the scene.

346
01:35:52,482 --> 01:35:54,098
Here come willing helpers

347
01:35:54,099 --> 01:35:57,099
To guide you to
Your very own machine!

348
01:36:42,313 --> 01:36:46,039
We're not gonna take it.
We're not gonna take it.

349
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:59,369
We're not gonna take it,
Never did and never will,

350
01:37:00,687 --> 01:37:02,954
We don't have to take it.

351
01:37:03,265 --> 01:37:06,416
Gonna break it!
Gonna shake it!

352
01:37:06,417 --> 01:37:08,417
Let's forget it better still!

353
01:37:50,746 --> 01:37:56,746
Don't want no religion,
As far as we can tell!

354
01:37:57,158 --> 01:38:02,158
We ain't gonna take you,
Never did and never will!

355
01:38:08,089 --> 01:38:11,700
We forsake you,
Gonna rape you,

356
01:38:12,094 --> 01:38:18,094
Let's forget you better still!

357
01:40:56,200 --> 01:41:02,200
Listening to you I get the music.
Gazing at you I get the heat.

358
01:41:03,967 --> 01:41:09,967
Following you I climb the mountain.
I get excitement at your feet!

359
01:41:13,870 --> 01:41:19,870
Right behind you I see the millions.
On you I see the glory.

360
01:41:21,958 --> 01:41:27,958
From you I get opinions.
From you I get the story.

361
01:41:37,590 --> 01:41:43,079
Listening to you I get the music.
Gazing at you I get the heat.

362
01:41:43,459 --> 01:41:49,459
Following you I climb the mountain.
I get excitement at your feet!

363
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:59,180
Right behind you I see the millions.
On you I see the glory.

364
01:42:01,974 --> 01:42:07,974
From you I get opinions.
From you I get the story.

365
01:42:33,052 --> 01:42:39,052
Right behind you I see the millions.
On you I see the glory.
