1
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:31,474
- Well, Jim, they look pretty good, huh?
- Certainly do, Chief.

2
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:55,961
If it does, it'll be a miracle.

3
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,038
Hey, how long we gotta
stand in line, sailor?

4
00:01:58,472 --> 00:02:00,906
- Sailor?
- Oh, you're the doorman?

5
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:03,738
Have you ever considered
any other branch of the service?

6
00:02:03,844 --> 00:02:06,938
The Army recruiting office is
just down the street, you know.

7
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:10,074
Oh, thanks gobs, gob,
but I gotta get in the Navy.

8
00:02:10,184 --> 00:02:12,414
It's practically doctor's orders,
practically.

9
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,646
Doctor's orders?

10
00:02:13,754 --> 00:02:17,520
Oh, yes, sir. You see, it's my allergies,
and my doctor says I need ocean travel,

11
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,752
and this is the only way I can afford it.

12
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,589
Do you know anyone in there?

13
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:25,029
The chief of this station and I are
as close as that.

14
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:27,928
Oh. Then maybe you can
do me a favor, sir.

15
00:02:28,035 --> 00:02:30,595
You see, I'm a little bit worried
about passing a physical,

16
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:32,639
and I thought maybe
you could get the chief in there

17
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,173
to put in a good word for me.

18
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:35,674
Well, you can depend on that.

19
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:39,143
I'll see that the chief tells them
all about you.

20
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,178
Oh, thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.

21
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:01,467
Gee, I hope he don't forget
to tell the chief about me.

22
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,201
Hey, buddy, I can't watch you go down
for the third time.

23
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,011
Be my guest?

24
00:03:14,115 --> 00:03:16,015
Oh, you want I should change places
with her?

25
00:03:16,117 --> 00:03:17,209
No!

26
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:19,513
You don't have to get mad.
I was just asking.

27
00:03:19,954 --> 00:03:21,945
Now, look, honey,
we can't hold up the Navy.

28
00:03:22,056 --> 00:03:23,785
Oh, Al, doll!

29
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:30,720
That'll hold you for four years.
Goodbye, sugar.

30
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:32,093
Goodbye.

31
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:34,967
Goodbye, Al.

32
00:03:40,007 --> 00:03:42,202
- Wasn't that...
- Hetty Button.

33
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:48,842
You know, if I could kiss a girl like that,
I wouldn't have to join the Navy.

34
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:51,144
Oh, cheer up, Atlas,
I'm only going through the motions.

35
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:53,686
I go in one door and come out the other.
They won't have me.

36
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:56,780
- How do you know?
- This is the 11th time I've tried to enlist.

37
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:59,018
They keep rejecting me.
I have a trick knee.

38
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:01,060
But these goodbyes
sure make it worthwhile.

39
00:04:01,428 --> 00:04:03,589
You mean after 11 times
she hasn't caught on?

40
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:04,857
That's the 11th girl.

41
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:07,860
Gee, you're lucky.
I can't even get close to a girl.

42
00:04:07,968 --> 00:04:10,266
I'm allergic to face powder,
perfume and lipstick.

43
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:13,101
If I get too close to a girl,
my uvula becomes edematous,

44
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:15,971
which means inflamed,
and if it becomes inflamed, it swells up.

45
00:04:16,076 --> 00:04:17,043
Then I can't breathe.

46
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:19,578
And if I can't breathe,
that could become fatal.

47
00:04:20,748 --> 00:04:23,581
- You said a mouthful.
- Do you know women could kill me?

48
00:04:23,684 --> 00:04:24,946
What a way to die.

49
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:28,544
Although I could dose myself with
privine, pyrobenzamine and Benadryl,

50
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:29,953
then breathing would be possible

51
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:32,048
but so expensive
I'd probably starve to death.

52
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,217
Yeah, what's the difference?

53
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:36,421
If you can't go out with any women,
you might as well be dead anyhow.

54
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,192
I got it. Why don't you go out
with a lot of women,

55
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,268
kiss them and build up an immunity?

56
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:44,633
I can't even get close to a girl.
I've never been kissed.

57
00:04:44,738 --> 00:04:46,535
Even my mother wouldn't have
the nerve.

58
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,766
Well, that figures.

59
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,467
All right, come on, let's close up.

60
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:53,275
The old man is still as bad as ever.

61
00:04:54,548 --> 00:04:56,209
Where do you think you're going?

62
00:04:56,317 --> 00:04:58,251
I was just... Nowhere.

63
00:04:58,352 --> 00:05:00,684
- What's it to you?
- Get back where you belong.

64
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:02,847
Don't let that fathead
talk to you like that.

65
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:04,288
Who's calling me a fathead?

66
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:06,222
My friend has a right to his own opinion.

67
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:07,385
Is that your opinion?

68
00:05:07,494 --> 00:05:09,553
I'll say it is. He thinks you're a stupid ox.

69
00:05:09,864 --> 00:05:13,527
- Now I'm a stupid ox, huh?
- I didn't say anything.

70
00:05:13,634 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't back down.
Tell him you'll punch him in the nose.

71
00:05:16,103 --> 00:05:18,298
Stop putting words in my mouth.
I won't say that.

72
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:21,203
- You won't say what?
- "I'll punch you in the nose."

73
00:05:21,308 --> 00:05:22,866
- Oh, I said it.
- Why, you...

74
00:05:23,377 --> 00:05:26,972
He broke the whole chest. Now my ribs
are busted, they're all smashed.

75
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:28,173
Come on.

76
00:05:44,465 --> 00:05:48,401
Hey, do you see that?
That little guy down the line?

77
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:52,896
- Yeah, Chief.
- Well, naturally, I don't want to interfere

78
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:55,202
and I don't want any leniency shown,

79
00:05:55,342 --> 00:05:59,642
but I do want to make certain
that this guy is really physically fit

80
00:05:59,747 --> 00:06:01,237
for the Navy.

81
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:02,713
Okay, Chief.

82
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:08,452
The squirt down the line is
a friend of the chief's. Pass it on.

83
00:06:10,891 --> 00:06:13,155
The weird one's a friend of the chief.

84
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,887
Wouldn't you know?

85
00:06:16,864 --> 00:06:19,230
See that squirrelly character
down there?

86
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,561
A friend of the chief's.

87
00:06:24,605 --> 00:06:26,266
Hey, they're all staring at me.

88
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:27,967
Stare back at them.

89
00:06:32,446 --> 00:06:34,641
Well, let's face it,
you are a little different.

90
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,147
Fill these out. Go over in the corner
and strip. Make it snappy.

91
00:06:39,253 --> 00:06:42,450
Fill these out. Go over in the corner
and strip. Move along.

92
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,450
Here are some papers
that we have to have filled out.

93
00:06:47,561 --> 00:06:49,859
We hope it won't be too much trouble.

94
00:06:49,964 --> 00:06:53,866
Then after that, would you mind going
over in the corner and disrobing?

95
00:06:54,902 --> 00:06:56,733
I don't even know you.

96
00:06:56,904 --> 00:07:00,806
Well, all of the other fellows are.
Wouldn't you?

97
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,107
Okay.

98
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:10,377
In your mouth.

99
00:07:10,484 --> 00:07:11,974
Open up. Open up.

100
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,687
What's your surname?

101
00:07:15,255 --> 00:07:17,883
You talk backwards.
You mean, "What's my name, sir?"

102
00:07:17,992 --> 00:07:19,550
I said surname.

103
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:22,119
- Sir?
- Yes.

104
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,161
Yes, what?

105
00:07:24,398 --> 00:07:25,729
Yes, sir.

106
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:28,061
Oh, you don't have to talk so polite
to me. No one ever does.

107
00:07:28,168 --> 00:07:29,135
You can call me Melvin.

108
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,494
Melvin?

109
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,028
Melvin Jones.

110
00:07:34,742 --> 00:07:38,610
Have you ever had erysipelas,
appendicitis, mumps, whooping cough,

111
00:07:38,712 --> 00:07:41,078
eye, ear, nose or throat trouble,
hay fever?

112
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:43,649
Any illness
other than those already noted?

113
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:44,718
That's all.

114
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:49,346
Hey! Where's my thermometer?

115
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:53,252
That was a thermometer?
I thought it was a peppermint stick.

116
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,623
- Roger. Over and out.
- Quiet!

117
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,568
Did you lose something?

118
00:09:13,674 --> 00:09:15,972
No, but I think you did.
Where's your heart?

119
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:17,338
You're the doctor.

120
00:09:19,213 --> 00:09:20,305
Yes.

121
00:09:20,414 --> 00:09:23,440
Be a good little boy now
and tell the doctor where your heart is.

122
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,347
You find it. I'm no stool pigeon.

123
00:09:26,386 --> 00:09:27,478
You're cold.

124
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:29,556
Cold. Getting warmer.

125
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:30,884
Here, I'll help you.

126
00:09:34,795 --> 00:09:38,253
I don't like to worry you, son, but did you
ever think of taking it easier?

127
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:39,457
You know, a thing...

128
00:09:43,604 --> 00:09:45,003
There must be one someplace.

129
00:09:50,444 --> 00:09:53,140
Finally found it. Running like a watch.

130
00:09:57,518 --> 00:10:00,180
Gee, I wish they'd tell us if we passed.

131
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,346
Say, before they do,
I'd like to get something off my chest.

132
00:10:03,457 --> 00:10:05,948
Fellas, in the 11 times
that I've tried to enlist,

133
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:07,959
I've never met a nicer bunch of men.

134
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:09,426
That goes for me, too.

135
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,623
Thanks to you, Al. Best of luck to youse.

136
00:10:11,732 --> 00:10:13,359
I'm really sorry to have to leave,

137
00:10:14,668 --> 00:10:16,226
except for you.

138
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,270
And I can say in all my Navy experience,
I've never met a bigger fathead.

139
00:10:20,374 --> 00:10:21,341
Why you, I...

140
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:23,807
Lardoski, recruiting officer wants
to see you.

141
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:24,878
Right, Chief.

142
00:10:28,315 --> 00:10:30,840
- Crowthers?
- Well, this is it, fellas.

143
00:10:30,951 --> 00:10:31,918
Yeah?

144
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:34,112
Congratulations.
I've got good news for you.

145
00:10:34,221 --> 00:10:37,657
They lowered the physical requirements
in the past two weeks. You're in now.

146
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:40,858
In fact, you all made it.

147
00:10:43,263 --> 00:10:44,821
They can't do this to me.

148
00:10:44,932 --> 00:10:47,196
Why don't you write a letter
to your congressman?

149
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:48,666
What good will that do?

150
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:51,294
No good, but you'll have a pen pal.

151
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:58,567
Lardoski, when we find someone
in a group of recruits

152
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,045
who has the qualities of leadership,
we put him in charge.

153
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:04,076
As a veteran
who has decided to re-enlist,

154
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:05,708
you'll get your old rating back.

155
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:08,185
- Thank you, sir.
- Oh, yes. Here are the records.

156
00:11:08,388 --> 00:11:09,980
It's guys like that fathead Lardoski

157
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,558
that must've caused the physical
requirements to be lowered.

158
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:15,127
Yeah, and I bet the Navy will get
those brainy guys

159
00:11:15,229 --> 00:11:16,856
to boss around the fatheads.

160
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:18,397
Boy, I'm gonna work real hard, too,

161
00:11:18,498 --> 00:11:19,965
and I'm gonna try
and get a commission.

162
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:23,628
And if I ever become a private,
will I boss that Lardoski around.

163
00:11:23,737 --> 00:11:24,931
Oh, no, I will.

164
00:11:25,038 --> 00:11:28,565
I'll walk right up to him,
I'll say, "You're a fathead."

165
00:11:28,675 --> 00:11:32,611
And I'd say,
"You're a stupid ox and you're..."

166
00:11:32,946 --> 00:11:34,038
You're here!

167
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:36,615
Petty Officer Lardoski will take charge
of this group.

168
00:11:36,717 --> 00:11:38,014
You will take your orders from him.

169
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:41,549
Remember, men,
you're in the Navy now.

170
00:11:41,655 --> 00:11:44,249
Okay, men, two ranks through this door,

171
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:46,757
and I don't want no goldbricking.

172
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:52,025
Excuse me, handsome.

173
00:11:52,132 --> 00:11:53,997
Where do you get
that "handsome" stuff?

174
00:11:54,201 --> 00:11:56,192
Didn't I hear the man call you
a pretty officer?

175
00:11:56,303 --> 00:11:58,271
He said, "Petty officer."

176
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,238
Okay, look alive, now.
Get going. Keep moving.

177
00:12:16,023 --> 00:12:17,422
What's the matter?

178
00:12:17,691 --> 00:12:19,249
I'm seasick already.

179
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:20,724
Oh, come here.

180
00:12:20,927 --> 00:12:22,326
Oh, boys.

181
00:12:22,796 --> 00:12:23,956
Boys!

182
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:25,992
Come on. Come on.

183
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,433
Pardon me, gentlemen,
but you are keeping the Navy waiting.

184
00:12:30,537 --> 00:12:32,801
If you will kindly pass through the gates,

185
00:12:32,906 --> 00:12:35,466
we'll try to make your life
comfortable and cozy.

186
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,772
Come up and see us sometime.

187
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:43,406
Get going, you dumb clucks!

188
00:12:43,517 --> 00:12:45,815
On the double. You're in the Navy now!

189
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:48,047
Step up. Right up here.

190
00:12:48,422 --> 00:12:49,389
You're done.

191
00:13:04,671 --> 00:13:07,606
- Hey, give me that.
- Don't yell. I'm nervous.

192
00:13:08,075 --> 00:13:11,636
- What do they want me here for?
- They want a sample of your blood.

193
00:13:11,745 --> 00:13:13,042
Who's giving samples?

194
00:13:13,146 --> 00:13:15,671
Blood isn't dress goods.
You say, "Snip off a swatch."

195
00:13:15,782 --> 00:13:17,807
You wanna see if it matches
the living room drapes.

196
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:19,010
Don't get excited.

197
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:21,883
Well, blood isn't orange juice.
What do they wanna do, sample it?

198
00:13:21,988 --> 00:13:24,218
And if they like it,
come back tomorrow for two quarts?

199
00:13:24,324 --> 00:13:25,882
They want a sample so they can type it.

200
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,287
They're not gonna type with my blood.

201
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:31,828
Let them use a typewriter ribbon.

202
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:33,923
- Ma!
- Hey, Melvin!

203
00:13:34,034 --> 00:13:36,901
- Ma!
- Hey, get back in line there.

204
00:13:50,317 --> 00:13:51,784
Do you have an appointment?

205
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:54,480
Would you mind waiting just a minute?

206
00:14:07,701 --> 00:14:09,601
What's the matter?
Aren't you housebroken?

207
00:14:10,203 --> 00:14:12,103
Hey, you don't use makeup, do you?

208
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:14,167
No, just a little lipstick.

209
00:14:14,841 --> 00:14:16,900
Oh, I'm glad. What's your name?

210
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,375
Hilda Jones.

211
00:14:18,478 --> 00:14:20,309
That's a coincidence. That's my name.

212
00:14:20,414 --> 00:14:23,212
- Hilda?
- No, Jones. Melvin Jones.

213
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:25,216
- Where were you born?
- I don't know.

214
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:28,153
You don't know where you were born?

215
00:14:28,255 --> 00:14:30,314
Oh, I thought you asked me
why was I born.

216
00:14:30,924 --> 00:14:32,482
I was born in a bed, I think.

217
00:14:32,726 --> 00:14:33,715
Don't you know?

218
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:36,860
How would I know?
I was just a little baby at the time.

219
00:14:37,564 --> 00:14:39,191
Oh, come on, we're wasting time.

220
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,030
- Have you been at the bank before?
- Three times.

221
00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:45,331
- Three times?
- I wanted to get a loan.

222
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:47,202
You wanted to borrow from the bank?

223
00:14:47,941 --> 00:14:49,568
Well, I was a little short at the time.

224
00:14:49,676 --> 00:14:51,200
I'd have paid it back
in a couple of months.

225
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:52,810
You should be ashamed of yourself,

226
00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:55,108
trying to borrow blood
when it's so badly needed.

227
00:14:55,215 --> 00:14:56,204
- Blood?
- Yes.

228
00:14:56,316 --> 00:14:58,147
Everyone should donate
to the blood bank.

229
00:14:58,251 --> 00:14:59,085
- What type are you?
- Oh, the quiet type.

230
00:14:59,085 --> 00:15:00,143
- What type are you?
- Oh, the quiet type.

231
00:15:00,253 --> 00:15:02,118
I go to bed at 9:00,
see a movie now and then,

232
00:15:02,222 --> 00:15:03,587
read some books, play checkers.

233
00:15:03,957 --> 00:15:05,822
No, I mean,
what kind of blood have you?

234
00:15:06,226 --> 00:15:08,786
- Red.
- Oh, come on, we're wasting time.

235
00:15:08,895 --> 00:15:11,887
I'll turn you over to the Red Cross nurse,
and she'll give you your orange juice.

236
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,090
- Orange juice?
- Yeah.

237
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,998
She'll give you a glass of orange juice,
and you give her a pint of blood.

238
00:15:16,102 --> 00:15:17,296
Oh, that sounds like a fair exchange.

239
00:15:17,404 --> 00:15:19,429
She gives me a glass of orange juice
and I give her...

240
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:20,833
A pint?

241
00:15:28,748 --> 00:15:31,046
I haven't got any more samples, fellas.

242
00:15:31,151 --> 00:15:33,449
I just gave it all away.

243
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:37,652
I'm scared. No, I'm scared.
Oh, come on, fellas.

244
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,322
- You still here?
- Yeah.

245
00:15:41,428 --> 00:15:44,886
Did you expect me to be back
at my old job, singing in a nightclub?

246
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:47,091
Meet my agent. He gets 10%.

247
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,430
That's all for you.

248
00:15:51,404 --> 00:15:53,372
All right, let's go. You're next.

249
00:15:53,473 --> 00:15:54,701
Come on. Come on.

250
00:15:54,808 --> 00:15:57,242
Come on, Melvin, this won't hurt you.
Go ahead.

251
00:15:57,344 --> 00:15:58,811
- It won't hurt?
- It won't hurt.

252
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:04,911
- It won't hurt.
- No.

253
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:16,458
- What have you been doing?
- I've been to the blood bank.

254
00:16:16,563 --> 00:16:18,497
Looks like your account's overdrawn.

255
00:16:19,032 --> 00:16:20,761
Could I get fired for this?

256
00:16:20,867 --> 00:16:23,563
No, but if you should see birds
following your ship,

257
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,935
don't bet they're seagulls, brother.
They're vultures.

258
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,031
Let me try that other arm.

259
00:16:42,122 --> 00:16:43,714
You sure you're living?

260
00:16:43,823 --> 00:16:45,290
Am I sure I'm living?

261
00:16:46,826 --> 00:16:47,884
I don't know.

262
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,198
Made a hole in the wrong place.

263
00:16:55,302 --> 00:16:57,202
I missed the hole, too.

264
00:16:57,304 --> 00:17:00,102
- What's par for this course?
- All right, all right.

265
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:02,766
It don't have to be blood.
I'll take anything.

266
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:17,714
Let's turn him upside down.
Maybe it runs the other way.

267
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:21,693
Well, might as well give up, fellas.

268
00:17:21,795 --> 00:17:24,628
We'll get blood if we have to dig all day.

269
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:27,500
What're you doing, patching a tire?

270
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:30,195
I never had so many needles stuck
in me in my whole life.

271
00:17:30,303 --> 00:17:32,999
- Oh, I don't feel good.
- Oh, I'll get some water.

272
00:17:33,106 --> 00:17:35,472
- You'll be all right.
- But I don't feel good.

273
00:17:35,575 --> 00:17:37,907
- Oh, brace up now.
- I'm dizzy.

274
00:17:38,011 --> 00:17:39,945
- No, you're all right.
- I'm all right.

275
00:17:40,046 --> 00:17:41,308
Here, drink this.

276
00:17:46,853 --> 00:17:49,583
I feel much better now.
Thank you very much.

277
00:17:51,224 --> 00:17:53,988
I'm leaking. Oh, I'm leaking.

278
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:56,729
Oh, no! Oh, no! No, not that.

279
00:17:56,863 --> 00:17:59,024
Oh, no! No, not that.

280
00:18:03,036 --> 00:18:04,367
I never touched him.

281
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:07,833
All right, men, this is your new home.

282
00:18:07,941 --> 00:18:10,000
Grab any bunk
and stow away your gear.

283
00:18:13,947 --> 00:18:16,677
Hey, you, tuck in your skivvy shirt.

284
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,179
Well, what's that for?

285
00:18:19,285 --> 00:18:22,550
This is my money belt, so I can save
all the money I earn in the Navy.

286
00:18:22,656 --> 00:18:23,714
For what?

287
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:26,485
So I can study electronics
when I'm through with my enlistment.

288
00:18:26,593 --> 00:18:29,426
I'm not gonna be foolish with my money
and gamble and drink it away.

289
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:31,190
Besides, I can't go out with girls.

290
00:18:31,297 --> 00:18:33,322
Well, all right, come on.
Let's look for our bunks,

291
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:35,526
because the only thing
you'll be able to do around here

292
00:18:35,635 --> 00:18:38,069
- in your spare time is sleep.
- Oh, here's a couple.

293
00:18:38,171 --> 00:18:41,140
Okay, you take the top. Go ahead.
Throw the bag up there.

294
00:18:42,642 --> 00:18:44,007
Hey, what...

295
00:18:49,115 --> 00:18:51,948
Why, you... Let me up out of here.

296
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:55,017
- I ought to...
- All right, now, take it easy, Chief.

297
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:56,281
He didn't mean to. He slipped.

298
00:18:56,823 --> 00:18:59,257
I'll take care of you later, Jones.

299
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,383
Come on, Melvin.

300
00:19:05,265 --> 00:19:07,130
Why do I always get in trouble?

301
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:11,930
You know,
I thought you were gonna be my friend,

302
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:13,733
someone I could look up to,

303
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:16,302
someone to be real close to me.

304
00:19:17,043 --> 00:19:19,409
Someone who'd stick by me
through thick or thin.

305
00:19:20,513 --> 00:19:22,037
Now you think I'm stupid.

306
00:19:22,682 --> 00:19:25,742
Don't cry, Melvin.
I don't think you're stupid.

307
00:19:25,952 --> 00:19:28,352
That's funny. Everyone else does.

308
00:19:28,955 --> 00:19:30,479
- Hey, Al?
- Yeah?

309
00:19:30,657 --> 00:19:33,285
Do you think I'll ever get
to look like a sailor?

310
00:19:34,194 --> 00:19:37,288
Sure. Why, in eight weeks
I won't know you from Admiral Halsey.

311
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:46,170
<i>Arms out. Two-count exercise.</i>
<i>Keep your arms straight, your head up.</i>

312
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:47,967
Keep your arms straight. Ready?

313
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,472
Begin! One, two, one, two.

314
00:19:51,578 --> 00:19:55,708
- Up, down, up, down.
- One, two, one, two,

315
00:19:55,815 --> 00:20:00,184
one, two, one, two, up, down, up, down,

316
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:04,245
one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two.

317
00:20:04,357 --> 00:20:06,222
One, two and two.

318
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:09,223
Feet apart with a jump, arms sideward.
Place.

319
00:20:09,462 --> 00:20:11,794
<i>A four-count exercise</i>
<i>beginning with the left hand.</i>

320
00:20:11,898 --> 00:20:14,298
Four-count exercise
beginning with the left hand. Ready?

321
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:15,661
- <i>Begin.</i>
- Begin!

322
00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:17,066
One, two,

323
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,432
three, four.

324
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:19,937
- One, two.
- <i>Left up.</i>

325
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,472
- Three, four.
- <i>Right up.</i>

326
00:20:21,574 --> 00:20:24,168
Left up, right up.

327
00:20:24,277 --> 00:20:26,677
A one, two and four.

328
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,681
Feet together with jump,
arms downward. Sink.

329
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:31,840
Arms sideward and upward.

330
00:20:33,186 --> 00:20:34,312
Raise!

331
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,285
Ready? Begin!

332
00:20:36,389 --> 00:20:39,324
One, two, down, up.

333
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:42,956
Down, up, a one, two.

334
00:20:43,296 --> 00:20:46,265
Down, up, a one, two.

335
00:20:46,466 --> 00:20:51,130
A one, two, one, two, one, two.

336
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:54,972
Down, up, down, up.

337
00:20:55,074 --> 00:20:59,773
One, two, one, two, one, two.

338
00:21:00,146 --> 00:21:03,274
Down. Up. Two and halt.

339
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:06,678
Palms together, turn,
arms sideward and downward. Sink.

340
00:21:06,786 --> 00:21:08,651
Feet apart with a jump and neck.

341
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:10,481
- <i>Fast.</i>
- Fast.

342
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,314
Begin!

343
00:21:12,425 --> 00:21:16,191
...two, three, four.
A one, two, three, four.

344
00:21:16,296 --> 00:21:20,255
A one, two, three, four.
A one, two, three, four.

345
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:24,234
A one, two, three, four.
A one, two, three, four.

346
00:21:24,337 --> 00:21:27,363
A one, two, three, four. A one, two.

347
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:30,707
Feet together with a jump,
arms downward. Sink.

348
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,380
<i>Break rank, fall out</i>
<i>and get your clothes!</i>

349
00:21:36,482 --> 00:21:39,007
Break ranks!
Fall out, get your clothes! Dismissed!

350
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,394
All right, men, this is the procedure
for lowering a boat.

351
00:22:30,503 --> 00:22:33,495
Muster crew,
remove cover and strongback.

352
00:22:33,606 --> 00:22:35,733
See that the automatic plug is free.

353
00:22:35,842 --> 00:22:38,310
Have painter forward outside of davits.

354
00:22:38,411 --> 00:22:42,279
Let go all gripes and boat chocks.
Remove reel covers,

355
00:22:42,382 --> 00:22:45,442
raise boat clear of chocks,
belay the falls,

356
00:22:45,551 --> 00:22:47,246
slack davit, guys, and...

357
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:53,655
Jones, repeat what I just said.

358
00:22:56,129 --> 00:22:57,619
Word for word?

359
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:00,425
Every if, and, and but?

360
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:02,000
Start talking!

361
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:07,064
Muster crew,
remove cover and strongbacks.

362
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,865
Be sure the automatic plug is free.

363
00:23:10,276 --> 00:23:13,404
Have painter forward
outboard of davits.

364
00:23:13,513 --> 00:23:17,142
Let go of gripes and boat chocks,
remove reel cover.

365
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,150
Raise boat to clear chocks.

366
00:23:19,252 --> 00:23:21,777
Belay the falls and slack davit, guys.

367
00:23:53,953 --> 00:23:55,318
Stroke!

368
00:23:55,488 --> 00:23:58,457
One, two, stroke!

369
00:23:58,725 --> 00:24:01,751
That's it, men. Put your backs into it.

370
00:24:02,495 --> 00:24:03,894
Stroke!

371
00:24:04,364 --> 00:24:06,559
- Watch the head.
- Stroke.

372
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:08,634
Come on, I said, watch the head!

373
00:24:08,735 --> 00:24:10,703
- Get it out of the way.
- Stroke.

374
00:24:11,604 --> 00:24:12,969
You missed.

375
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,434
Stroke.

376
00:24:18,177 --> 00:24:19,371
Jones.

377
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:21,777
Get the water out of that boat.

378
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:23,605
Aye, aye, sir.

379
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,244
Stroke.

380
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,109
Stroke.

381
00:24:28,221 --> 00:24:31,418
Get the water out of the boat!
Get the water out of the boat!

382
00:24:34,961 --> 00:24:38,590
Jones, I said,
get the water out of the boat!

383
00:24:39,032 --> 00:24:41,830
Get the water out of the boat.
Get the water out of the boat.

384
00:24:42,135 --> 00:24:43,193
One.

385
00:24:43,536 --> 00:24:44,696
Two.

386
00:24:45,004 --> 00:24:46,198
Stroke.

387
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:58,213
Put that plug back!

388
00:24:59,652 --> 00:25:01,244
Aye, aye, sir.

389
00:25:02,188 --> 00:25:06,284
- Jones, get the water out of that boat.
- Aye, aye, sir.

390
00:25:16,335 --> 00:25:19,998
- Get the water out of the boat!
- Aye, aye, sir.

391
00:25:21,307 --> 00:25:24,333
- Out of the boat.
- Aye, aye, sir.

392
00:25:24,444 --> 00:25:26,207
Get the water...

393
00:25:29,348 --> 00:25:33,580
At this point in your training,
you guys could figure on a big liberty,

394
00:25:33,686 --> 00:25:36,018
but it don't look like
we're gonna get one on account

395
00:25:36,122 --> 00:25:39,023
of the way a certain bluejacket
has been acting up.

396
00:25:40,526 --> 00:25:43,757
What's this "certain bluejacket" stuff?
You afraid to mention his name?

397
00:25:43,863 --> 00:25:46,661
No, I ain't. If the shoe fits, put it on.

398
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,461
There's no basis for metabolism.

399
00:25:49,569 --> 00:25:52,561
Certainly I'm aware of the fact that
there are other men concerned here,

400
00:25:52,672 --> 00:25:55,072
and you still can't feel that
a physical being is abstract.

401
00:25:55,174 --> 00:25:58,109
You've got to base the full heart
and soul on the ingredient

402
00:25:58,211 --> 00:26:01,806
that other people are aware of the fact
that physical being isn't even involved.

403
00:26:01,914 --> 00:26:04,781
- Isn't that right?
- Why, you stupid, little...

404
00:26:04,884 --> 00:26:07,978
- Which one of you guys is Crowthers?
- Here, sir.

405
00:26:08,788 --> 00:26:12,315
Special Service would like you to sing
on the <i>Tempting Kiss</i> TV show today.

406
00:26:12,425 --> 00:26:13,915
I've arranged for your liberty.

407
00:26:14,026 --> 00:26:17,120
Thank you, sir, but I don't think it's fair
that I should take liberty

408
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,492
just because I can sing a song,

409
00:26:18,598 --> 00:26:20,088
and the rest of the fellows
have to stay here

410
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:24,295
because a certain chief enjoys
taking liberty from a certain bluejacket.

411
00:26:24,403 --> 00:26:25,836
All right, Crowthers.

412
00:26:25,938 --> 00:26:27,963
Lardoski, give all of these men liberty,

413
00:26:28,107 --> 00:26:29,870
if they can be ready in a half an hour.

414
00:26:41,988 --> 00:26:44,149
- Are you on liberty, too?
- Uh-huh.

415
00:26:45,992 --> 00:26:47,584
Gee, Hilda, I'm glad I met you.

416
00:26:49,162 --> 00:26:51,653
- You know, I just thought of something?
- What?

417
00:26:51,764 --> 00:26:54,198
What would happen if I get a call
to return to the base,

418
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,293
pack my equipment, board the ship, and
they sent me to Alaska or someplace?

419
00:26:58,404 --> 00:27:00,235
I wouldn't forget you.

420
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,441
Well, I'll see that you don't.
Stick out your hand.

421
00:27:07,647 --> 00:27:10,377
- Hey, you tied a square knot.
- I did?

422
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:13,017
I didn't even know I could do it.

423
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,984
Would you go into town with me?

424
00:27:31,571 --> 00:27:33,596
Well, that'll keep you away
from the rest of the girls, won't it?

425
00:27:33,706 --> 00:27:34,673
Uh-huh.

426
00:27:34,941 --> 00:27:37,000
We better hurry.
I want you to hear Al sing.

427
00:27:37,109 --> 00:27:39,168
What is this Tempting Kiss Lipstick?

428
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:41,269
Oh, that's the kind I use.
It doesn't smear or rub off.

429
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,472
You want to test it?

430
00:27:42,582 --> 00:27:45,210
Here in the street, in front of everyone?
No!

431
00:27:49,555 --> 00:27:51,022
Okay, test it.

432
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,491
- You're right, nothing happened.
- I'll say nothing happened.

433
00:27:57,597 --> 00:27:59,531
Come on, we'll be late.

434
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,863
- Come on.
- All right.

435
00:28:05,471 --> 00:28:06,870
Oh, here we are.

436
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,838
- Where are we going?
- Right here.

437
00:28:09,942 --> 00:28:11,739
A television station?

438
00:28:11,844 --> 00:28:15,644
They got a cathode tube and
a master oscillator that just won't quit.

439
00:28:15,748 --> 00:28:16,976
Come on.

440
00:28:28,027 --> 00:28:29,619
Thank you. Thank you.

441
00:28:29,729 --> 00:28:33,130
Well, how are
all my kissable girls today?

442
00:28:33,232 --> 00:28:34,893
Fine, Mr. Chubby.

443
00:28:35,001 --> 00:28:36,935
We have a lot of fun here, don't we?

444
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,767
Yes, sir.

445
00:28:38,871 --> 00:28:42,739
And today, today we're going to select
the most kissable girl in San Diego.

446
00:28:42,842 --> 00:28:44,366
Now, what do you think of that, huh?

447
00:28:45,611 --> 00:28:47,977
And the winner will receive
a Hellman mink coat,

448
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,844
a complete set
of Chapman bicycle tires,

449
00:28:50,983 --> 00:28:52,382
an Ellington grease gun,

450
00:28:52,485 --> 00:28:55,147
a 10-year supply
of Go Gettum Dog Food,

451
00:28:55,254 --> 00:28:57,222
four Donavan wristwatches,

452
00:28:57,323 --> 00:29:00,759
10 glorious days
at the Palm Garden Hotel in Honolulu

453
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:05,559
and a complete wardrobe by Edythe
for the lucky girl who gets the trip.

454
00:29:08,334 --> 00:29:10,234
There's our sailor now.

455
00:29:10,336 --> 00:29:13,066
- We've been waiting for you.
- Who, me? What did I do?

456
00:29:13,172 --> 00:29:15,936
- Will you come up here, please?
- Oh, yeah.

457
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,271
Isn't he handsome, girls?

458
00:29:22,014 --> 00:29:25,347
This is my pal, Al Crowthers.
He's supposed to sing on your program.

459
00:29:25,451 --> 00:29:28,386
Here's our first guest, ladies,
Al Crowthers.

460
00:29:31,657 --> 00:29:33,488
Take it away, Al. You'll accompany him?

461
00:29:33,592 --> 00:29:36,288
- Oh, yeah. Where are we going, Al?
- We're not going anywhere, Melvin.

462
00:29:36,395 --> 00:29:38,795
- He wants you to help me with my song.
- Oh, well, how?

463
00:29:38,898 --> 00:29:41,628
I don't know. We haven't got
an orchestra. I don't know what to do.

464
00:29:41,734 --> 00:29:43,793
- You want I should hum?
- No, no.

465
00:29:43,936 --> 00:29:45,233
Got any other ideas?

466
00:29:48,074 --> 00:29:49,701
Yeah, I have an idea.

467
00:29:51,911 --> 00:29:55,210
- Oh, good. Go ahead, bring them up.
- Come on up, fellas.

468
00:29:59,352 --> 00:30:01,377
Yeah, you play the piano, Fred.

469
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:18,871
Melvin.

470
00:30:18,871 --> 00:30:19,098
Melvin.

471
00:30:20,139 --> 00:30:22,334
I'll be too old to sing this number.

472
00:30:23,642 --> 00:30:25,166
Now, hurry up.

473
00:30:30,116 --> 00:30:31,549
<i>Today</i>

474
00:30:32,952 --> 00:30:34,214
<i>Tomorrow</i>

475
00:30:35,054 --> 00:30:36,282
<i>Forever</i>

476
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:43,884
<i>You are the one girl I love</i>

477
00:30:47,266 --> 00:30:48,426
<i>Today</i>

478
00:30:49,068 --> 00:30:50,433
<i>Tomorrow</i>

479
00:30:51,404 --> 00:30:52,598
<i>Forever</i>

480
00:30:55,007 --> 00:30:59,774
<i>As long as stars shine above</i>

481
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:01,403
<i>The stars that shine</i>
<i>The stars that shine</i>

482
00:31:01,514 --> 00:31:02,481
<i>The stars that shine</i>

483
00:31:03,382 --> 00:31:08,342
<i>This is no mere infatuation</i>

484
00:31:08,521 --> 00:31:11,319
<i>One, two, three, four</i>
<i>We love your voice, so sing some more</i>

485
00:31:11,857 --> 00:31:16,191
<i>This time it's real</i>
<i>The sweet sensation</i>

486
00:31:19,465 --> 00:31:24,129
<i>Always and always together</i>

487
00:31:27,306 --> 00:31:31,640
<i>That's how it's fated to be</i>

488
00:31:34,613 --> 00:31:36,012
<i>Today</i>

489
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:38,277
<i>Tomorrow</i>

490
00:31:39,084 --> 00:31:40,346
<i>Forever</i>

491
00:31:43,656 --> 00:31:48,252
<i>You are the one girl</i>

492
00:31:49,195 --> 00:31:51,186
<i>For me</i>

493
00:31:51,464 --> 00:31:55,366
<i>You are my one love</i>

494
00:32:07,046 --> 00:32:10,812
And now, ladies, don't you think
a sailor would make a perfect judge

495
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:12,543
for our Tempting Kiss contest?

496
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:17,386
Where's the handsome one?

497
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,515
Oh, well, you'll do.
We want you to be our judge.

498
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:22,059
You're going to be Mr. Temptation.

499
00:32:22,161 --> 00:32:25,062
- Oh, no, you don't.
- He seems to be a little bit shy.

500
00:32:25,164 --> 00:32:27,098
But we'll take care of that,
won't we, girls?

501
00:32:29,068 --> 00:32:31,696
Can you imagine anyone being shy
who comes from...

502
00:32:31,804 --> 00:32:33,897
Where'd you say you were from?
He's from Brooklyn!

503
00:32:38,377 --> 00:32:41,744
Now, before our contest begins,
a word on behalf of our sponsor. We...

504
00:32:41,847 --> 00:32:43,144
I didn't say Brooklyn.

505
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,614
We of the Tempting Kiss
Lipstick Company believe...

506
00:32:50,723 --> 00:32:55,160
- I was born in Ottumwa, lowa.
- Ottumwa, lowa! Well...

507
00:32:55,261 --> 00:32:58,526
Tempting Kiss Lipstick won't smear,
won't stain...

508
00:32:58,631 --> 00:33:01,122
- Where were you born?
- Galesburg, Illinois.

509
00:33:03,802 --> 00:33:05,565
All right. All right.

510
00:33:05,671 --> 00:33:08,504
Tempting Kiss Lipstick comes in
three convenient sizes.

511
00:33:08,607 --> 00:33:10,632
- You can get it in...
- Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

512
00:33:12,511 --> 00:33:15,105
Now, please. You just go
right over there and sit down.

513
00:33:15,214 --> 00:33:17,774
Will you, please? Just take a chair
for a minute. Right over there.

514
00:33:17,883 --> 00:33:19,145
That's right. Thank you very much.

515
00:33:19,251 --> 00:33:22,846
Our product is sold in the stubby,
the regular and in...

516
00:33:22,955 --> 00:33:24,616
Irvington, New Jersey!

517
00:33:27,593 --> 00:33:28,924
Harlan, Kentucky.

518
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,161
Quincy, Massachusetts.

519
00:33:34,733 --> 00:33:36,667
Clearwater, Florida.

520
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:41,072
San Diego, California.

521
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:47,670
San Diego? That's my station.
I gotta get off of here.

522
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,680
Oh, no, you don't. No, you don't.

523
00:33:49,782 --> 00:33:50,806
You're going to stay right here

524
00:33:50,916 --> 00:33:53,043
and select the most kissable girl
in San Diego.

525
00:33:53,485 --> 00:33:56,886
Now, remember, ladies, it's within
Mr. Temptation's power

526
00:33:56,989 --> 00:33:59,082
to give any of you a mink coat

527
00:33:59,191 --> 00:34:02,217
and 10 glorious days in Honolulu!

528
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,654
All right.

529
00:34:05,764 --> 00:34:08,756
All right, now one contestant at a time,
please, one at a time.

530
00:34:08,867 --> 00:34:10,664
Ready? Go!

531
00:34:10,803 --> 00:34:13,897
One at a time, girls, one at a time!
One at a time!

532
00:34:14,607 --> 00:34:17,167
Ladies, ladies, ladies!

533
00:34:18,077 --> 00:34:21,274
Ladies, one at a time.
Oh, stop it, you stupid, old...

534
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,577
One at a time, girls!

535
00:34:26,051 --> 00:34:27,518
One at a time!

536
00:34:29,555 --> 00:34:30,852
Stop!

537
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,056
One at a time!

538
00:34:56,815 --> 00:34:59,682
- Maybe he's in Studio 7.
- Try it. Try it.

539
00:35:03,088 --> 00:35:05,386
I am Pierre. I am the top man.

540
00:35:05,491 --> 00:35:06,458
There he is.

541
00:35:08,093 --> 00:35:11,256
I am the top man.
This man is an imposter.

542
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,586
<i>These lovely models will now show</i>
<i>the newest trend in swim fashion.</i>

543
00:35:34,687 --> 00:35:35,847
What a town this is.

544
00:35:35,954 --> 00:35:38,479
The dames won't have anything to do
with sailors around here.

545
00:35:38,657 --> 00:35:39,954
Oh, yeah?

546
00:35:40,192 --> 00:35:44,151
Wait till you see the beautiful babe
that's gonna meet me here.

547
00:35:44,263 --> 00:35:46,424
Boy, look at those beautiful babes.

548
00:35:50,002 --> 00:35:52,562
Hey, the one on the end is my date.

549
00:35:56,742 --> 00:36:00,269
<i>The black Lastex molded one-piece suit</i>
<i>with one shoulder strap.</i>

550
00:36:00,379 --> 00:36:02,438
<i>Note the water-proofed jeweled pin</i>
<i>at the neckline.</i>

551
00:36:02,548 --> 00:36:05,711
Wait a minute. Hey, ain't that Jones?

552
00:36:07,152 --> 00:36:09,143
<i>It's Mr. Temptation.</i>

553
00:36:16,795 --> 00:36:18,786
Hey, he's kissing my dame.

554
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:22,929
What's the matter,
somebody blow a tube?

555
00:36:23,035 --> 00:36:24,593
Yeah, my friend here.

556
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:43,920
Hilda, please let me explain.
It wasn't my fault.

557
00:36:44,022 --> 00:36:45,956
Well, you certainly acted
like you enjoyed it.

558
00:36:46,058 --> 00:36:48,049
Go on back to your public,
Mr. Temptation.

559
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,218
I'm going back to the base.

560
00:36:49,328 --> 00:36:51,057
Oh, but, Hilda, listen.

561
00:36:52,664 --> 00:36:55,827
Please, leave me alone.
I can hardly breathe.

562
00:36:56,401 --> 00:36:58,164
Well, here you are.

563
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:01,103
Now, before you run away again,
I want to know who won our contest.

564
00:37:01,206 --> 00:37:04,232
I don't care who won the contest.
All I know is I lost.

565
00:37:04,343 --> 00:37:06,368
But we must know who won our contest.

566
00:37:06,478 --> 00:37:08,639
Now, who's the most kissable girl
in San Diego?

567
00:37:16,722 --> 00:37:19,555
Miss Hilda Jones
of the Navy training center.

568
00:37:19,658 --> 00:37:20,625
Some nerve!

569
00:37:20,726 --> 00:37:23,718
Well, thank you. Thank you very much.

570
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:26,024
You're my witnesses. Thank you.

571
00:37:26,131 --> 00:37:27,291
Hilda.

572
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:28,724
Hilda.

573
00:37:29,601 --> 00:37:30,795
Hilda!

574
00:37:30,903 --> 00:37:33,235
Don't speak to me
after kissing all those girls.

575
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:36,535
- You won the contest.
- You can have your old contest

576
00:37:36,675 --> 00:37:39,644
and you can have your piece of string,
too. I don't want it!

577
00:37:39,745 --> 00:37:41,178
Hilda!

578
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,547
Hilda!

579
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:45,646
Hilda!

580
00:38:06,672 --> 00:38:07,798
Hilda!

581
00:38:09,741 --> 00:38:11,299
Hilda!

582
00:38:17,382 --> 00:38:19,680
What's the matter, sailor,
did you lose something?

583
00:38:19,785 --> 00:38:21,650
I lost a piece of string.

584
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:24,719
You wouldn't have any Benadryl,
would you?

585
00:38:24,823 --> 00:38:26,791
This one must've been drinking
tear gas.

586
00:38:27,259 --> 00:38:29,659
Oh, gee.
I was just trying to find a string.

587
00:38:30,195 --> 00:38:32,891
Imagine just kissing girls
putting a guy in a hospital.

588
00:38:33,765 --> 00:38:35,858
Hey, Doc,
what room is Melvin Jones in?

589
00:38:35,968 --> 00:38:37,868
Right in here. But no visitors.

590
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,335
No kidding. Is he real sick?

591
00:38:39,438 --> 00:38:41,702
He has an edema
of the olfactory system.

592
00:38:41,807 --> 00:38:44,742
See? You ask a foolish question,
you get a foolish answer.

593
00:38:44,843 --> 00:38:47,141
And stay out of this room, huh?

594
00:38:50,048 --> 00:38:51,606
Oh, pardon me, Lieutenant.

595
00:38:51,717 --> 00:38:54,481
Jones in 116. He won't take his pill.

596
00:38:54,586 --> 00:38:56,918
- Oh, he won't, eh?
- Pardon me, Lieutenant.

597
00:38:57,022 --> 00:38:59,081
- How's our friend Jones?
- I don't know.

598
00:38:59,191 --> 00:39:02,183
But if he doesn't cooperate with me,
his condition is going to be a lot worse.

599
00:39:02,294 --> 00:39:04,728
How would you like me to be waiting
for you when you get off duty?

600
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:07,298
How would you like to spend 30 days
in the brig?

601
00:39:09,301 --> 00:39:11,326
I see you got refrigeration here.

602
00:39:11,436 --> 00:39:14,303
When it comes to sailors,
she's colder than a deep freeze.

603
00:39:15,173 --> 00:39:18,700
And my pal Melvin's just lucky enough
to be the one to defrost her.

604
00:39:20,045 --> 00:39:21,876
Come on, now, let's take this pill.

605
00:39:23,515 --> 00:39:26,678
I only have a 13 and a half neck.
It'll choke me.

606
00:39:26,785 --> 00:39:29,913
Not if you take it
with a big swallow of water.

607
00:39:30,989 --> 00:39:32,616
I want my mother.

608
00:39:32,858 --> 00:39:34,382
Isn't he sweet?

609
00:39:35,694 --> 00:39:38,094
Now, if your mother was here,
she'd say,

610
00:39:38,196 --> 00:39:39,891
"Open your mouth."

611
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:42,933
Well, come on, open it.

612
00:39:43,568 --> 00:39:45,627
Open it up. Come on.

613
00:39:45,737 --> 00:39:48,433
That's right. Now, stick out your tongue.

614
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,973
Stick it out.

615
00:39:52,577 --> 00:39:57,037
Now, take a big swallow of water.

616
00:39:59,952 --> 00:40:01,579
That's the boy.

617
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,371
- It went down.
- Of course it did.

618
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:34,983
Now, it'll make you sleep.
Come on, now, lie back.

619
00:40:36,788 --> 00:40:38,949
Lieutenant, I'm homesick.

620
00:40:39,257 --> 00:40:42,886
- I don't think I'll be able to sleep.
- But you must sleep.

621
00:40:44,062 --> 00:40:47,361
If my mother was here,
she'd kiss me right here.

622
00:40:47,866 --> 00:40:49,197
All right.

623
00:40:49,401 --> 00:40:51,665
It's sure taking her a long time
to give him a pill.

624
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:54,830
He probably didn't cooperate,
and she had to get rough.

625
00:40:55,374 --> 00:40:56,568
Hey, let's take a look.

626
00:41:03,281 --> 00:41:05,272
Sleep well, my dear boy.

627
00:41:09,121 --> 00:41:11,112
Boy, the way those models
went after that Melvin...

628
00:41:11,223 --> 00:41:13,020
I don't know. It's a mystery to me.

629
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:15,184
Did you see the way
they tore him apart?

630
00:41:15,694 --> 00:41:18,629
I figure it this way.
Girls just can't resist him.

631
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,756
Hey, I'll lay a little money
I can pick a dame

632
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:23,562
who won't have anything to do with him.

633
00:41:23,668 --> 00:41:25,727
If she does, I'll pay off.

634
00:41:26,805 --> 00:41:30,502
- Well, put up or shut up.
- I'll bet six months pay.

635
00:41:30,609 --> 00:41:32,804
- I'll take $100 of that.
- I'll take $200 of that.

636
00:41:32,911 --> 00:41:33,900
I'll bet my wristwatch.

637
00:41:34,012 --> 00:41:37,175
Okay, I'll take all bets.
You're all covered.

638
00:41:37,282 --> 00:41:40,774
And if you know of anybody else,
just send them around to see me.

639
00:41:40,886 --> 00:41:41,978
Hey, Chief.

640
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:44,588
Sailing orders for your draft.

641
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:48,357
Okay, men, gather around.
These are our orders.

642
00:41:48,627 --> 00:41:50,959
"For the purpose of fleet training

643
00:41:51,063 --> 00:41:54,794
"and for familiarization
with various types of naval craft,

644
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,567
"Training Squadron 87 B will be
dispatched to Honolulu

645
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,604
"in the following manner."

646
00:42:00,705 --> 00:42:04,903
They got it cut up into three classes.
Destroyers, battleships and submarine.

647
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:07,205
- Submarine?
- Yeah, and our group's on it.

648
00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:08,841
Honolulu.

649
00:42:09,147 --> 00:42:12,947
Hey, that's where Corinne Calvet is.
I'll be able to see her.

650
00:42:13,051 --> 00:42:15,178
You better be careful
Melvin doesn't see her first.

651
00:42:15,787 --> 00:42:18,255
Hey, that's the girl. Corinne.

652
00:42:18,423 --> 00:42:21,790
All the dough that Jones can't make
the grade with her.

653
00:42:21,893 --> 00:42:23,952
- Corinne?
- No, that makes it too tough.

654
00:42:24,062 --> 00:42:27,862
- What's the matter, you getting yellow?
- Okay, Corinne it is.

655
00:42:27,966 --> 00:42:31,902
All right, men, let's get on the ball.
Turn in and get a good night's sleep.

656
00:42:32,003 --> 00:42:33,994
Tomorrow we're on our way.

657
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:35,538
<i>Now, hear this.</i>

658
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,370
<i>Now, hear this. Drill in one hour.</i>

659
00:42:41,346 --> 00:42:43,814
Hi, Al. Look, I'm all cured.

660
00:42:44,116 --> 00:42:46,778
Well, you look like you're in shape
to kiss a girl.

661
00:42:46,885 --> 00:42:49,649
Hilda? Oh, she's mad at me.
She won't even talk to me.

662
00:42:49,754 --> 00:42:51,221
No, not Hilda.

663
00:42:51,356 --> 00:42:53,790
Well, you know, any other dame,
I can't get close to.

664
00:42:53,892 --> 00:42:55,382
I get swelling in back of my nose.

665
00:42:55,494 --> 00:42:57,325
If you don't get close to the girl
I tell you to,

666
00:42:57,429 --> 00:42:59,454
you'll get a swelling
in the front of your nose.

667
00:42:59,564 --> 00:43:01,498
There's a lot of money bet on you.

668
00:43:05,637 --> 00:43:07,832
What if Tiger disappears
with all that loot?

669
00:43:08,106 --> 00:43:11,234
Don't worry.
I got a couple of guys watching him.

670
00:43:12,844 --> 00:43:14,869
And he's holding the bets.

671
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,380
Holding bets on me? What for?

672
00:43:17,616 --> 00:43:20,312
- Now, look, you're my pal, right?
- Yeah.

673
00:43:20,418 --> 00:43:24,184
I said that no girl can resist you,
and Lardoski says they can.

674
00:43:24,289 --> 00:43:26,189
So the guys got a lot of dough together,

675
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:29,124
and they bet that you can kiss any girl
that Lardoski named.

676
00:43:29,227 --> 00:43:30,854
He named Corinne.

677
00:43:31,463 --> 00:43:34,261
And, kid, I bet a bundle myself.

678
00:43:35,433 --> 00:43:37,867
What if I'm allergic to her
and I can't kiss her?

679
00:43:37,969 --> 00:43:39,937
Then you and all the boys will lose
all your money.

680
00:43:40,272 --> 00:43:43,867
I won't do it on purpose, but if I do,
well, you can borrow money from me.

681
00:43:44,009 --> 00:43:46,739
- No, Melvin, that's all right.
- Oh, no. I won't take no for an answer.

682
00:43:46,845 --> 00:43:50,110
You are my friend and you are my pal.
You can have all the money you want.

683
00:43:50,215 --> 00:43:53,673
- No, Melvin, that's all right.
- What do you keep saying no for?

684
00:43:53,919 --> 00:43:55,546
Because I bet six months of your pay

685
00:43:55,654 --> 00:43:57,212
and every cent you had
in your money belt.

686
00:43:57,322 --> 00:43:58,846
Well, that's no reason to say no.

687
00:43:58,957 --> 00:44:00,254
Because you bet six months of my pay

688
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:03,054
and all the money in my money belt?

689
00:44:03,962 --> 00:44:06,157
Take it easy.
Now, just shut up and listen.

690
00:44:06,264 --> 00:44:09,165
There was nothing else I could do.
You're my buddy, right?

691
00:44:09,634 --> 00:44:12,535
You wouldn't want me to lose my money
and not lose yours, too, would you?

692
00:44:12,637 --> 00:44:14,730
Oh, well, that would be selfish
on your part.

693
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:17,740
Sure. Besides, if you win,
you'll practically be a millionaire.

694
00:44:17,842 --> 00:44:19,867
If I win, I won't be able to breathe.

695
00:44:19,978 --> 00:44:22,503
Now, which is more important,
breathing or money?

696
00:44:22,614 --> 00:44:24,878
Besides, the boys bet a fortune on you.

697
00:44:26,284 --> 00:44:28,684
All right, I'll do the best I can.

698
00:44:29,054 --> 00:44:30,988
And where's this Corinne dame,
anyway?

699
00:44:31,089 --> 00:44:32,056
Honolulu.

700
00:44:32,424 --> 00:44:34,415
Well, what's there to worry about?

701
00:44:34,526 --> 00:44:36,756
If she's in Honolulu,
we're here in San Diego,

702
00:44:36,861 --> 00:44:39,352
- it could be years before we ever met.
- Yeah.

703
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:42,459
Yeah.

704
00:44:43,768 --> 00:44:45,633
We're going to Honolulu tomorrow.

705
00:44:46,037 --> 00:44:47,561
Tomorrow?

706
00:44:48,573 --> 00:44:50,871
- What ship?
- Not by ship.

707
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:52,770
- Not by ship?
- No.

708
00:44:52,978 --> 00:44:54,741
- Plane?
- Not by plane.

709
00:44:54,846 --> 00:44:56,279
Not by plane?

710
00:44:56,648 --> 00:44:58,616
What do they want us to do,
swim across?

711
00:44:58,717 --> 00:45:01,550
- We're going by submarine.
- Oh, submarine.

712
00:45:01,653 --> 00:45:04,144
I get sick going down in an elevator.

713
00:45:12,464 --> 00:45:15,365
- What did he have to wind them for?
- Quit your beefing.

714
00:45:15,467 --> 00:45:17,492
You're lucky nobody bet a cuckoo clock.

715
00:45:19,971 --> 00:45:20,938
Detail, halt.

716
00:45:30,282 --> 00:45:33,581
Detail from Training Squadron 87 B
reporting as ordered, sir.

717
00:45:33,685 --> 00:45:34,879
At ease, men.

718
00:45:35,253 --> 00:45:38,882
Lardoski, you'll be the only one
for whom it will not be a new experience

719
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:41,652
to sail aboard a submarine.
You'll be in charge of our passengers

720
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,557
and see that they don't get in the way
of ship's company.

721
00:45:43,662 --> 00:45:45,527
- Yes, sir.
- It must be remembered that

722
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:47,188
we're merely transporting them.

723
00:45:47,299 --> 00:45:49,597
They'll get their further assignments
when we get to Honolulu.

724
00:45:50,101 --> 00:45:51,193
And for the rest of you men,

725
00:45:51,303 --> 00:45:54,204
there is a certain freedom that's
permitted in the submarine service.

726
00:45:54,306 --> 00:45:57,469
Among the officers and enlisted men,
we do away with the usual formalities

727
00:45:57,575 --> 00:45:59,440
because of the confined space.

728
00:45:59,577 --> 00:46:02,842
All right, Lardoski, you can load them
aboard the forward torpedo room hatch.

729
00:46:07,118 --> 00:46:10,645
Oh, he's friendly.
Won't this be ginger peachy?

730
00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:12,120
Yeah, real keen.

731
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:15,454
All right, men, follow me, single file.
Let's go!

732
00:46:22,767 --> 00:46:24,462
Put your bag right down the hatch.

733
00:46:25,003 --> 00:46:26,630
Take it easy now.

734
00:46:28,273 --> 00:46:29,865
Watch your step.

735
00:46:30,275 --> 00:46:32,175
You'll get used to it.

736
00:46:33,812 --> 00:46:35,370
Follow him right down.

737
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,072
Bag, that's right.

738
00:46:38,149 --> 00:46:40,140
I'm very glad we're gonna be informal.

739
00:46:40,251 --> 00:46:43,414
My name is Melvin Jones,
but you can call me Melvin.

740
00:46:43,521 --> 00:46:47,423
- Go on, get going!
- I'm going. You don't have to yell.

741
00:46:58,737 --> 00:47:01,103
Why don't you watch what you're doing?

742
00:47:01,206 --> 00:47:03,197
Stop the head, Al, stop the head.

743
00:47:03,308 --> 00:47:06,141
- I don't like it here. I'm gonna quit.
- What do you mean quit?

744
00:47:06,244 --> 00:47:08,474
Submarine service is
the safest part of the Navy.

745
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,275
Safest part? I almost got killed.

746
00:47:10,382 --> 00:47:13,351
All you have to do is keep your head up,
eyes straight and watch your step.

747
00:47:13,451 --> 00:47:15,180
Once you get the hang of it,
it's very simple.

748
00:47:16,087 --> 00:47:18,385
Head up, eyes straight
and watch your step.

749
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:21,653
Now, let's go find our quarters
before something else happens to you.

750
00:47:23,828 --> 00:47:25,318
Oh, come on!

751
00:47:36,174 --> 00:47:38,165
Gee, I hope they checked this for leaks.

752
00:47:38,276 --> 00:47:40,039
Watch where you're going.

753
00:47:40,145 --> 00:47:42,477
Hey, Al, it ain't much,
but we could fix it up.

754
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:44,445
Well, do you think
it's good enough for us?

755
00:47:44,549 --> 00:47:47,746
Not really, but I think we should grab it
before a couple of other guys do.

756
00:47:47,852 --> 00:47:50,286
- Somebody else already grabbed it.
- Yeah?

757
00:47:50,388 --> 00:47:52,185
Well, possession is
nine points of the law.

758
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:54,485
I'd like to see somebody else grab it,
huh, Al?

759
00:47:54,592 --> 00:47:56,890
We'll put clean sheets on
and everything.

760
00:47:58,196 --> 00:48:00,061
Melvin, you better leave the sheets on.

761
00:48:00,165 --> 00:48:03,134
Leave the sheets on?
How do we know who slept on it?

762
00:48:03,601 --> 00:48:06,832
Come on, Al, you're not helping me
at all. Throw these out in the hall.

763
00:48:11,142 --> 00:48:14,373
- AI, the Commander. The Commander.
- This is my stateroom, sailor.

764
00:48:14,479 --> 00:48:17,039
You've got one minute
to get this place cleaned up and get out,

765
00:48:17,148 --> 00:48:19,514
or you'll spend the rest of this trip
chained to a torpedo!

766
00:48:19,617 --> 00:48:21,585
I'm sorry, sir, we'll take care of it.

767
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:25,389
We'd better hurry.
They'll be assigning bunks.

768
00:49:16,274 --> 00:49:18,538
All right, men, get your gear in order

769
00:49:18,643 --> 00:49:21,134
and stow your empty sea bags
under the bunks.

770
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:24,773
And where were you?
Kissing the engineer?

771
00:49:24,883 --> 00:49:28,649
- Come on, Lardoski, lay off of him.
- Yeah, lay off. I've been sick.

772
00:49:28,853 --> 00:49:30,787
That first bunk is yours.

773
00:49:30,889 --> 00:49:34,950
- Oh!
- Not up there. Down there.

774
00:49:42,667 --> 00:49:45,864
- How am I supposed to get in there?
- You just lie down,

775
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:49,770
and the man above pulls his bunk down,
gets in, and so on.

776
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:53,234
Turk, Crowthers, these two are yours.

777
00:49:53,545 --> 00:49:56,105
Bull, 'Bama, take those two.

778
00:50:45,363 --> 00:50:47,524
Put that back into your sea bag.

779
00:50:47,632 --> 00:50:49,623
It's just in case
we have to abandon ship.

780
00:50:49,734 --> 00:50:51,929
I said put it back.

781
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:54,602
How can I get this back in my sea bag?

782
00:50:57,075 --> 00:51:01,341
Now, get rid of that thing,
then turn in, all of you.

783
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:11,454
Shut up and turn in, all of you.

784
00:51:11,556 --> 00:51:13,080
Big man, big...

785
00:51:22,033 --> 00:51:23,261
Hey, Al?

786
00:51:24,068 --> 00:51:26,662
- What?
- I forgot to take my shoes off.

787
00:51:28,473 --> 00:51:30,134
- Hey, Turk.
- What?

788
00:51:30,241 --> 00:51:31,936
He forgot to take his shoes off.

789
00:51:45,757 --> 00:51:47,088
Thank you.

790
00:51:54,899 --> 00:51:58,096
- You all right now?
- I never sleep with my shoes on.

791
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,263
All right, come on. Let's go.

792
00:52:01,973 --> 00:52:03,702
You can put it down now.

793
00:52:07,779 --> 00:52:09,144
Okay, Turk.

794
00:52:18,589 --> 00:52:19,817
Hey, Al?

795
00:52:20,124 --> 00:52:22,354
- What?
- I forgot to brush my teeth.

796
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,088
- Oh, do it in the morning.
- I'm thirsty.

797
00:52:25,196 --> 00:52:27,357
Drill a hole in the side of the ship.

798
00:52:27,699 --> 00:52:29,394
Where will I get the tools?

799
00:52:32,537 --> 00:52:34,027
Lie still, will you?

800
00:52:35,506 --> 00:52:38,236
I think I'm gonna faint. I gotta get up.

801
00:52:39,477 --> 00:52:41,240
- Hey, Turk.
- What?

802
00:52:41,345 --> 00:52:43,870
- Melvin's gotta get up.
- Why does he gotta get up?

803
00:52:43,981 --> 00:52:46,950
He's sick. We gotta take care of him.
We gotta a lot of dough on him.

804
00:52:47,051 --> 00:52:48,882
We've done everything
but sing him to sleep.

805
00:52:48,986 --> 00:52:51,079
I like to be sung to sleep.

806
00:52:51,756 --> 00:52:54,350
Okay, okay. I'll do that, too.

807
00:52:57,662 --> 00:52:58,754
<i>Today</i>

808
00:52:59,764 --> 00:53:02,824
<i>Tomorrow, forever</i>

809
00:53:03,201 --> 00:53:05,601
What's going on here?
You were ordered secured for the night.

810
00:53:05,703 --> 00:53:07,364
- Yes, sir.
- Who was singing?

811
00:53:07,472 --> 00:53:09,064
I was, sir. Seaman Crowthers.

812
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:10,968
Report to me in the mess compartment
in 10 minutes.

813
00:53:11,075 --> 00:53:13,475
He didn't do it, sir. It was me.

814
00:53:13,578 --> 00:53:15,136
Do what you want with me.

815
00:53:15,246 --> 00:53:18,409
Swing me to the yardarm,
batten me down the hatches,

816
00:53:18,516 --> 00:53:21,451
hoist me to the mizzenmast,
make me walk the plank,

817
00:53:21,552 --> 00:53:24,544
throw me to the sharks.
I did the singing.

818
00:53:24,956 --> 00:53:26,184
You couldn't.

819
00:53:31,095 --> 00:53:33,222
- Crowthers reporting, sir.
- Very well.

820
00:53:33,331 --> 00:53:35,094
Hey, I only sent for Crowthers.

821
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:36,996
Well, we wanted to take
the blame, too, sir.

822
00:53:37,101 --> 00:53:39,001
I'm not blaming him for anything.

823
00:53:39,103 --> 00:53:41,401
As you know, life aboard a submarine
can be pretty confining.

824
00:53:41,506 --> 00:53:42,768
We like to keep the morale up.

825
00:53:42,874 --> 00:53:44,842
I thought he'd like to sing
with the boys here.

826
00:53:45,109 --> 00:53:47,600
- Oh, you mind if the fellows sit in?
- No, carry on.

827
00:53:47,712 --> 00:53:48,838
Thank you, sir.

828
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:51,341
Well, let's start messing around
with something.

829
00:53:51,449 --> 00:53:53,246
You know <i>The Sailors' Polka?</i>

830
00:53:53,785 --> 00:53:54,752
Let's go.

831
00:53:57,922 --> 00:54:01,790
<i>Come on and play the sailors' polka</i>

832
00:54:03,127 --> 00:54:06,324
<i>Make way for Navy blue</i>

833
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:10,890
<i>Oh, how the girls all love to polka</i>

834
00:54:11,335 --> 00:54:15,396
<i>With a sailor who's tried and true</i>

835
00:54:15,506 --> 00:54:19,340
<i>Where there is music</i>
<i>and there's moonlight</i>

836
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:23,609
<i>The Navy knows what to do</i>

837
00:54:24,649 --> 00:54:28,107
<i>So come on and play the sailors' polka</i>

838
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:32,248
<i>Make way for Navy blue</i>

839
00:54:33,191 --> 00:54:35,386
<i>Oh, the band will start in playing</i>

840
00:54:35,493 --> 00:54:37,586
<i>When the fleet comes sailing in</i>

841
00:54:37,695 --> 00:54:39,788
<i>They'll be hip hip hip hooray-ing</i>

842
00:54:39,897 --> 00:54:41,922
<i>And the good times will begin</i>

843
00:54:42,033 --> 00:54:44,092
<i>They'll be gobs and gobs of misses</i>

844
00:54:44,202 --> 00:54:46,295
<i>Who'll be waiting on the shore</i>

845
00:54:46,404 --> 00:54:48,429
<i>With gobs and gobs of kisses</i>

846
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:50,530
<i>For the gobs that they adore</i>

847
00:54:50,641 --> 00:54:52,734
<i>Long before they drop the anchor</i>

848
00:54:52,844 --> 00:54:54,812
<i>You will hear the music start</i>

849
00:54:54,912 --> 00:54:56,937
<i>Every pretty girl will hanker</i>

850
00:54:57,048 --> 00:54:58,640
<i>To win a sailor's heart</i>

851
00:54:58,749 --> 00:55:01,309
<i>Yeah, the band will start in playing</i>

852
00:55:01,419 --> 00:55:03,319
<i>And the dancing will begin</i>

853
00:55:03,421 --> 00:55:06,879
<i>When the fleet comes sailing in</i>

854
00:55:07,225 --> 00:55:11,821
<i>Come on and play the sailors' polka</i>

855
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:16,122
<i>Make way for Navy blue</i>

856
00:55:16,234 --> 00:55:19,863
<i>Oh, how the girls all love to polka</i>

857
00:55:21,105 --> 00:55:24,199
<i>With a sailor who's tried and true</i>

858
00:55:25,176 --> 00:55:29,738
<i>Where there is music</i>
<i>And there's moonlight</i>

859
00:55:29,847 --> 00:55:32,907
<i>The Navy knows what to do</i>

860
00:55:34,218 --> 00:55:37,676
<i>So come on and play the sailors' polka</i>

861
00:55:38,856 --> 00:55:42,656
<i>Make way for Navy blue</i>

862
00:55:44,262 --> 00:55:48,722
<i>Make way for Na</i>

863
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,868
Submerge, submerge.

864
00:55:51,302 --> 00:55:53,668
- <i>... vy</i>
- <i>... vy</i>

865
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:55,237
Scrape the bottom.

866
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:00,900
- <i>Blue</i>
- <i>Blue</i>

867
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:12,217
Clark, go forward and relieve the watch.

868
00:56:12,323 --> 00:56:13,449
Aye, aye, Chief.

869
00:56:13,557 --> 00:56:15,787
Hey, Jones, take these wheels,
will you?

870
00:56:20,932 --> 00:56:24,026
Chief, the hydraulic line carried away.
Come on down and give me a lift.

871
00:56:24,135 --> 00:56:25,193
Okay.

872
00:56:32,743 --> 00:56:35,075
I wonder which one is the brake.

873
00:56:46,991 --> 00:56:49,516
Take the scope.
I'll see what's going on down there.

874
00:56:51,062 --> 00:56:52,723
What are you, a wise guy?

875
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:54,297
You ought to be shot out of a torpedo.

876
00:56:54,398 --> 00:56:56,923
- He ought to be shot, period.
- I didn't mean to do nothing.

877
00:56:57,034 --> 00:56:58,092
Knock it off.

878
00:56:58,202 --> 00:57:00,727
Jones, you've caused more trouble
in the few days you've been on my ship

879
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:03,705
- than I've had in all my years of service.
- Nobody's perfect.

880
00:57:03,808 --> 00:57:06,140
Lardoski, will you see
that he's kept out of mischief

881
00:57:06,243 --> 00:57:08,074
- until we reach Pearl Harbor?
- Aye, aye, sir.

882
00:57:12,049 --> 00:57:16,315
I know a very nice, quiet, safe place

883
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,888
to put you for the rest of this voyage.

884
00:57:19,323 --> 00:57:20,290
Come on!

885
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:15,395
This is the Captain speaking
to all you new men.

886
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,037
We're going to make a dive shortly.
This is a normal operation.

887
00:59:19,143 --> 00:59:21,338
You'll hear two blasts
on the diving alarm,

888
00:59:21,445 --> 00:59:22,935
and in about 50 seconds we'll be under.

889
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:28,709
Clear the bridge, clear the bridge.
Dive, dive.

890
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,769
Green board, pressure in the boat, sir.

891
00:59:51,876 --> 00:59:54,868
- Very well, 60 feet.
- 60 feet. Aye, aye, sir.

892
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:08,608
Al! Al!

893
01:01:44,622 --> 01:01:47,819
Hey, down there,
if you can hear me, yell "Roger!"

894
01:01:50,427 --> 01:01:53,055
- What is it, Captain?
- I don't know. You look.

895
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,566
If you can't hear me, can you see me?

896
01:01:58,669 --> 01:02:00,000
Over. Roger.

897
01:02:01,105 --> 01:02:03,938
- What do you figure it is?
- I've got no idea, sir.

898
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:07,874
It's Melvin. Melvin Jones.

899
01:02:08,779 --> 01:02:10,076
Let's see.

900
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:15,018
Bye, seagull.

901
01:02:16,086 --> 01:02:18,680
Pete, take a look at this.

902
01:02:21,992 --> 01:02:24,586
- Did you make it out?
- Can't make it out, Captain.

903
01:02:25,496 --> 01:02:26,724
Let's wipe it off.

904
01:02:36,373 --> 01:02:38,967
- Still there, sir.
- Let's see.

905
01:02:40,377 --> 01:02:42,902
Al! Al!

906
01:02:44,181 --> 01:02:45,546
Take a look at this.

907
01:02:49,386 --> 01:02:51,320
Looks like a sea monster to me,
Captain.

908
01:02:51,422 --> 01:02:53,083
Sea monster? What?

909
01:02:53,957 --> 01:02:56,152
I've never seen anything like it before.

910
01:03:02,499 --> 01:03:04,990
Make all preparations to surface.
Two main engines.

911
01:03:05,102 --> 01:03:07,696
Standby to surface. Two main engines.
Aye, aye, sir.

912
01:03:30,427 --> 01:03:32,793
Hey, you, there! Get down here.

913
01:03:33,097 --> 01:03:36,555
- Who is that man?
- This is a fine way to treat a guest.

914
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,198
- What's that character doing up there?
- That character, sir, is Melvin Jones.

915
01:03:41,305 --> 01:03:44,672
- Hey, you, get down here!
- I'm hurrying.

916
01:03:44,775 --> 01:03:46,868
I'm coming as fast as I can.

917
01:03:50,981 --> 01:03:53,279
You, Jones,
what were you doing on deck?

918
01:03:53,384 --> 01:03:54,976
You closed the doors.

919
01:03:55,719 --> 01:03:57,949
I can't swim. I could've drowned.

920
01:03:58,055 --> 01:04:00,421
Didn't you hear the order
to clear the bridge and dive?

921
01:04:00,557 --> 01:04:03,890
- Dive? I just told you I can't swim.
- Lay below.

922
01:04:03,994 --> 01:04:06,758
- Through the hatch.
- Aye, aye, sir.

923
01:04:41,598 --> 01:04:43,691
Liberty commences immediately.

924
01:04:43,801 --> 01:04:47,635
Expires on board at 0745 tomorrow.

925
01:04:47,738 --> 01:04:49,467
Leave your quarters.

926
01:04:52,776 --> 01:04:53,743
Honolulu!

927
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,204
Come on, let's go.

928
01:04:59,249 --> 01:05:01,012
Pearl Harbor.

929
01:05:01,118 --> 01:05:03,643
- Corinne.
- Oh, you lucky women.

930
01:05:05,456 --> 01:05:07,253
Oh, you catching cold?

931
01:05:07,724 --> 01:05:10,591
- No, I think there's girls on shore.
- You mean you can smell them?

932
01:05:10,694 --> 01:05:12,958
No, he's used to that.
Every time women are around,

933
01:05:13,063 --> 01:05:14,121
that's what happens to him.

934
01:05:14,231 --> 01:05:16,358
He has that female radar
built right in his nose.

935
01:05:16,467 --> 01:05:18,492
- And when it clogs, it means girls.
- Dames.

936
01:05:18,602 --> 01:05:19,569
Women.

937
01:05:21,672 --> 01:05:24,163
Now, put me down, fellas, please.

938
01:05:24,274 --> 01:05:27,004
Hey, Al, tell them to put me down!

939
01:05:27,110 --> 01:05:30,477
Fellas, please put me down.

940
01:05:30,714 --> 01:05:33,911
Come on, fellas, will you put me down?

941
01:05:34,017 --> 01:05:37,111
He's allergic to dames, lady.
We're using him like radar.

942
01:05:38,622 --> 01:05:41,420
Yeah, they must be in here.
Look, his eyes are getting watery.

943
01:05:41,525 --> 01:05:44,961
I can't breathe.
Put me down, I can't breathe.

944
01:05:45,062 --> 01:05:47,587
That means we're warm.
Coming in, Lardoski?

945
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:51,327
You can say that again, mate.
And I'll point out Corinne.

946
01:05:51,435 --> 01:05:53,335
You don't have to. I saw the picture.

947
01:05:53,537 --> 01:05:54,765
Hilda!

948
01:05:56,607 --> 01:05:57,938
Don't you "Hilda" me.

949
01:05:58,041 --> 01:05:59,474
I'm even sorry we have the same name.

950
01:05:59,576 --> 01:06:02,511
Let me down, fellas.
Are you stationed here?

951
01:06:02,613 --> 01:06:05,013
No, I'm living here
for the 10 glorious days

952
01:06:05,115 --> 01:06:07,583
I won on the Tempting Kiss
Lipstick contest.

953
01:06:07,684 --> 01:06:08,878
The Navy granted me a leave.

954
01:06:08,986 --> 01:06:11,284
Lady, stay away from him,
will you, please?

955
01:06:11,388 --> 01:06:12,946
He's concentrating on only one dame.

956
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:15,286
Don't worry, sailor,
I'll stay away from him,

957
01:06:15,392 --> 01:06:17,826
- as far as I can get.
- Hilda, please.

958
01:06:17,928 --> 01:06:20,396
- Save your strength, Romeo.
- Hilda.

959
01:06:20,497 --> 01:06:23,261
- Come on. Let's go inside.
- Let me down, fellas.

960
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:24,760
Hilda!

961
01:06:25,736 --> 01:06:26,896
Hilda.

962
01:06:31,208 --> 01:06:32,698
<i>Merci beaucoup</i>

963
01:06:33,243 --> 01:06:35,074
<i>Thank you, monsieur</i>

964
01:06:35,445 --> 01:06:36,844
<i>Thank you</i>

965
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:43,911
<i>The cocktails you served</i>
<i>Were really so grand</i>

966
01:06:44,021 --> 01:06:48,185
<i>And my heart skipped a beat</i>
<i>When you touched my hand</i>

967
01:06:49,092 --> 01:06:51,287
<i>As you served me the</i>

968
01:06:52,129 --> 01:06:54,256
<i>Caviar</i>

969
01:06:54,364 --> 01:06:57,356
<i>And that delightful cheese</i>

970
01:07:00,337 --> 01:07:03,670
<i>It was so nice</i>

971
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:07,868
<i>Merci beaucoup</i>

972
01:07:08,245 --> 01:07:10,577
<i>Thank you, monsieur</i>

973
01:07:10,681 --> 01:07:12,376
<i>Thank you</i>

974
01:07:14,952 --> 01:07:19,184
<i>I'm afraid that the wine</i>
<i>It went to my head</i>

975
01:07:19,289 --> 01:07:21,223
<i>But I got such a

976
01:07:21,325 --> 01:07:22,383
<i>Thrill</i>

977
01:07:22,492 --> 01:07:25,518
- There she is.
- What a piece of furniture.

978
01:07:25,629 --> 01:07:28,962
Wow! I ain't never seen anything
like that except in pictures.

979
01:07:29,066 --> 01:07:31,626
Gee, I wonder how that dress
would look on Hilda.

980
01:07:32,369 --> 01:07:34,064
- Come on, let's go to the bar.
- Come on.

981
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:42,077
<i>It was so nice</i>

982
01:07:44,648 --> 01:07:47,481
<i>Thank you, monsieur</i>

983
01:07:49,586 --> 01:07:51,713
<i>Thank you</i>

984
01:08:02,432 --> 01:08:04,764
- A bourbon and water, please.
- I'll have a Scotch and water.

985
01:08:04,868 --> 01:08:05,892
Right, sir.

986
01:08:06,003 --> 01:08:07,493
I thought you were out of the Navy,
Lardoski.

987
01:08:07,604 --> 01:08:09,003
Oh, I shipped over.

988
01:08:09,206 --> 01:08:10,503
Where did Corinne go?

989
01:08:10,674 --> 01:08:12,539
She'll be back soon. Are you still trying?

990
01:08:12,643 --> 01:08:14,941
- Isn't everybody?
- They sure are.

991
01:08:15,045 --> 01:08:17,673
My singer quit me last week on account
of she wouldn't date him.

992
01:08:17,781 --> 01:08:18,941
I didn't understand it.

993
01:08:19,049 --> 01:08:21,574
She used to get dreamy-eyed
every time he'd sing like this.

994
01:08:21,685 --> 01:08:23,778
<i>Moonlight becomes you</i>

995
01:08:23,887 --> 01:08:24,854
Oh, you mean,

996
01:08:24,955 --> 01:08:28,083
<i>Moonlight becomes you</i>

997
01:08:28,325 --> 01:08:31,351
Say, my patrons would enjoy having
a serviceman entertain them.

998
01:08:31,461 --> 01:08:34,294
- Oh, I'm not interested.
- A little number in front of the band?

999
01:08:34,398 --> 01:08:36,195
Anything the boys want is on the house.

1000
01:08:36,299 --> 01:08:38,062
Oh, that's different!

1001
01:08:44,474 --> 01:08:47,910
- Melvin, you're staying with me.
- I want to find Hilda.

1002
01:08:48,011 --> 01:08:49,000
You're staying with me

1003
01:08:49,112 --> 01:08:51,012
if you have to stand next to me
while I sing the song.

1004
01:08:51,114 --> 01:08:52,843
Oh, Al, no. Al.

1005
01:08:52,949 --> 01:08:53,973
- What was the name?
- AI Crowthers.

1006
01:08:54,418 --> 01:08:56,909
Ladies and gentlemen, we're very
fortunate in having a guest artist,

1007
01:08:57,020 --> 01:08:59,352
Seaman Al Crowthers,
United States Navy.

1008
01:09:01,858 --> 01:09:03,689
All right, Melvin,
you're gonna do a song with me.

1009
01:09:03,794 --> 01:09:07,230
- I don't know no song.
- Sure, the one we did in the submarine?

1010
01:09:07,464 --> 01:09:09,329
Oh, yeah, I like that number.

1011
01:09:09,433 --> 01:09:10,991
- <i>The Sailors' Polka.</i>
- Yeah, what do I do in it?

1012
01:09:11,101 --> 01:09:12,466
- You do the fast part.
- How's it go?

1013
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:15,800
<i>Oh, the band will start in playing</i>
<i>And the good times will begin</i>

1014
01:09:15,906 --> 01:09:17,498
Oh, that's good. What part do you sing?

1015
01:09:17,607 --> 01:09:18,596
The slow part.

1016
01:09:18,709 --> 01:09:21,644
<i>Come on and play the sailors' polka</i>

1017
01:09:21,745 --> 01:09:23,372
Oh, let's try it.

1018
01:09:24,181 --> 01:09:28,777
- <i>Come on and play the sailors' polka</i>
- <i>Oh, the band will start in</i>

1019
01:09:28,919 --> 01:09:33,720
<i>playing</i>

1020
01:09:33,824 --> 01:09:35,291
Mel.

1021
01:09:35,792 --> 01:09:38,192
You're probably wondering
why I stopped.

1022
01:09:38,295 --> 01:09:41,162
- You forgot the words?
- Come on, Melvin, do the fast parts.

1023
01:09:41,264 --> 01:09:44,256
<i>Oh, the band will start in playing</i>
<i>And the good times will begin</i>

1024
01:09:44,367 --> 01:09:46,733
I got it now. Hurry up before I forget.

1025
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:50,501
- <i>Come on and play the sailors'</i>
- <i>Oh, the band will start in playing</i>

1026
01:09:50,607 --> 01:09:51,801
Shut up!

1027
01:09:52,576 --> 01:09:53,565
What's wrong with you?

1028
01:09:53,677 --> 01:09:55,611
You got the easy part,
that's what's wrong.

1029
01:09:55,712 --> 01:09:57,839
- You want to switch parts?
- Yeah, let me do your part.

1030
01:09:57,948 --> 01:09:59,074
Okay.

1031
01:10:00,083 --> 01:10:04,383
<i>Come on and play the sailors' polka</i>

1032
01:10:04,488 --> 01:10:09,084
<i>I see birdies with wheels so bare</i>

1033
01:10:09,726 --> 01:10:12,286
"See birdies with wheels so bare"?

1034
01:10:12,395 --> 01:10:14,192
- Oh, you, too?
- Will you get out of here?

1035
01:10:14,297 --> 01:10:16,595
Well, I didn't know the words,
so I made them up.

1036
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:18,668
I don't like that song, anyhow.

1037
01:10:18,969 --> 01:10:20,664
How would you like to do a song
in unison?

1038
01:10:20,771 --> 01:10:23,638
- No, let's do it here in the club.
- Sure. Why leave?

1039
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,508
Let's make it a little harder.
You and I do a trio.

1040
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:28,737
Where we gonna get four guys?

1041
01:10:28,979 --> 01:10:31,641
Look, in this next number,
you don't even have to know the song.

1042
01:10:31,748 --> 01:10:33,113
You don't even have to sing.

1043
01:10:33,216 --> 01:10:35,207
Oh, we're gonna do another one
together both?

1044
01:10:35,318 --> 01:10:37,912
"Together both"? That's as bad as,
"Up the street, the soldiers,

1045
01:10:38,021 --> 01:10:39,579
"they're marching down."

1046
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:43,121
Now, come on, let's sing the song.
You just automatically flow right into it.

1047
01:10:43,226 --> 01:10:45,126
- All right, let's flow.
- Okay.

1048
01:10:51,768 --> 01:10:56,705
<i>My grandpa was a minstrel man</i>

1049
01:10:57,207 --> 01:11:00,665
<i>A minstrel man was he</i>

1050
01:11:00,777 --> 01:11:03,109
<i>And to tell the truth</i>

1051
01:11:03,213 --> 01:11:05,238
<i>I guess I've got</i>

1052
01:11:05,415 --> 01:11:08,782
<i>Some minstrel blood in me</i>

1053
01:11:09,653 --> 01:11:12,349
<i>You can have all the harps in heaven</i>

1054
01:11:12,455 --> 01:11:15,822
<i>Blow all the horns here on the ground</i>

1055
01:11:15,926 --> 01:11:18,622
<i>But I find I still</i>

1056
01:11:18,929 --> 01:11:21,397
<i>Get my greatest thrill</i>

1057
01:11:22,232 --> 01:11:26,726
<i>Every time I hear this sound</i>

1058
01:11:26,837 --> 01:11:29,237
<i>I love to hear</i>

1059
01:11:29,773 --> 01:11:32,241
<i>An old calliope</i>

1060
01:11:32,342 --> 01:11:37,302
<i>I love the melody of an old calliope</i>

1061
01:11:38,048 --> 01:11:40,243
<i>And when you hear</i>

1062
01:11:40,851 --> 01:11:43,945
<i>The thrilling harmony</i>

1063
01:11:44,054 --> 01:11:48,218
<i>Gather round</i>
<i>The minstrel's show's in town</i>

1064
01:11:49,292 --> 01:11:51,726
<i>It sounds so grand</i>

1065
01:11:52,362 --> 01:11:54,922
<i>That old calliope</i>

1066
01:11:55,031 --> 01:11:57,795
<i>What is more heavenly</i>

1067
01:11:57,901 --> 01:12:00,563
<i>Than an old calliope</i>

1068
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:03,002
<i>Here comes the band</i>

1069
01:12:03,406 --> 01:12:06,534
<i>Oh, what a sight to see</i>

1070
01:12:06,643 --> 01:12:11,512
<i>Gather round</i>
<i>The minstrel's show's in town</i>

1071
01:12:13,016 --> 01:12:15,314
<i>Banjos strumming</i>

1072
01:12:18,688 --> 01:12:20,986
<i>Folks are humming</i>

1073
01:12:24,294 --> 01:12:26,592
<i>Minstrel's coming</i>

1074
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:32,168
<i>What a show</i>
<i>What a show</i>

1075
01:12:32,269 --> 01:12:34,737
- <i>It's the finest show I know</i>
- <i>It's the finest show I know</i>

1076
01:12:34,838 --> 01:12:37,398
- <i>It's coming near</i>
- <i>It's coming near, it's coming near</i>

1077
01:12:37,507 --> 01:12:39,873
- <i>That old calliope</i>
- <i>What a sight to see</i>

1078
01:12:39,976 --> 01:12:42,774
- <i>Oh, what a melody</i>

<i>Who's that lady</i>

1087
01:13:09,306 --> 01:13:11,797

We're going to take you with us
wherever we go.

1104
01:15:30,814 --> 01:15:33,078
With that voice of yours,
we'll get free drinks all over the world.

1105
01:15:33,183 --> 01:15:34,343
- Okay.
- What'll you have?

1106
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:37,181
Ginger ale. Then I wanna go home.

1107
01:15:37,287 --> 01:15:39,312
I don't think Corinne is gonna show up.

1108
01:15:43,626 --> 01:15:45,218
There she blows.

1109
01:15:47,097 --> 01:15:48,394
Who's the tugboat with her?

1110
01:15:48,498 --> 01:15:51,296
Oh, that's her secretary.
Her first line of defense.

1111
01:15:52,602 --> 01:15:53,660
Wow.

1112
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:58,671
Hold fast.

1113
01:15:59,242 --> 01:16:00,937
Here's to Corinne.

1114
01:16:01,177 --> 01:16:03,270
- Here's to Hilda.
- To dames.

1115
01:16:03,379 --> 01:16:04,573
Women.

1116
01:16:04,681 --> 01:16:06,581
Hello, Corinne, baby.

1117
01:16:07,217 --> 01:16:08,616
Remember me?

1118
01:16:08,785 --> 01:16:11,720
Miss Calvet to you.
Now go away, sailor, will you?

1119
01:16:11,821 --> 01:16:15,188
Oh, just testing. Same old Corinne.

1120
01:16:18,695 --> 01:16:20,094
All right, come on, champ.
Now you can do it.

1121
01:16:20,196 --> 01:16:21,458
Yeah, she can't resist you.

1122
01:16:21,564 --> 01:16:24,499
- I want Hilda.
- After all the dough we've got on you?

1123
01:16:24,701 --> 01:16:28,159
Go on, lover boy,
take a crack at Miss Hard-to-get.

1124
01:16:28,738 --> 01:16:30,103
And keep an eye on him,

1125
01:16:30,206 --> 01:16:33,664
because pretty soon everything on him
belongs to me.

1126
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:35,869
I wish everything on me
belonged to somebody.

1127
01:16:35,979 --> 01:16:39,380
The way I'm ticking, my heart could stop
and I wouldn't know it for two days.

1128
01:16:39,482 --> 01:16:41,780
- You ready, Melvin?
- No, I'm scared.

1129
01:16:41,885 --> 01:16:43,284
Come on,
there's nothing to worry about.

1130
01:16:43,386 --> 01:16:46,514
- Come on, Melvin.
- Come on.

1131
01:16:46,623 --> 01:16:48,750
- All right.
- Atta boy.

1132
01:16:48,858 --> 01:16:50,155
- Good luck, Melvin.
- You can do it.

1133
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:51,227
Watch this.

1134
01:16:51,928 --> 01:16:53,259
Hi, girls.

1135
01:16:54,364 --> 01:16:56,298
Don't say a word. Maybe they'll go away.

1136
01:16:56,399 --> 01:16:58,196
- Sit down, Melvin.
- Thank you.

1137
01:17:01,171 --> 01:17:04,334
Oh, pardon me,
but my name is Melvin Jones.

1138
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,305
Would you like a sarsaparilla?

1139
01:17:07,343 --> 01:17:08,537
You sure he's a sailor?

1140
01:17:08,645 --> 01:17:11,443
Oh, sure. He's a wonderful guy
once you get to know him.

1141
01:17:11,548 --> 01:17:13,778
- We won't be around that long.
- Let's you and I dance.

1142
01:17:13,883 --> 01:17:15,407
Oh, I'd love...

1143
01:17:15,518 --> 01:17:17,418
Miss Calvet and I have
an agreement with the management.

1144
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,512
We can't mingle with the guests,
especially sailors.

1145
01:17:20,623 --> 01:17:23,820
We only have an hour.
What can happen in an hour?

1146
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:26,160
Now I'm not sure you're a sailor.

1147
01:17:26,262 --> 01:17:28,924
Go ahead. This one looks safe.

1148
01:17:32,302 --> 01:17:33,826
I don't feel safe.

1149
01:17:35,505 --> 01:17:38,099
- Do you have a light?
- Oh, I don't smoke.

1150
01:17:38,208 --> 01:17:40,369
- Do you mind if I do?
- Oh, yes, I do.

1151
01:17:40,476 --> 01:17:43,639
You see, the smoke irritates
the membranes in my nose.

1152
01:17:43,746 --> 01:17:45,577
Then my uvula becomes
edematous and...

1153
01:17:45,682 --> 01:17:46,910
Why don't you speak English?

1154
01:17:49,118 --> 01:17:51,712
Oh, I am. That means I can't breathe.

1155
01:17:53,656 --> 01:17:55,647
Well, I'm starting to feel that way, too.

1156
01:17:55,758 --> 01:17:58,090
Oh. You know, I wanted to say that...

1157
01:17:58,261 --> 01:17:59,751
- Well...
- Sailor, I don't know

1158
01:17:59,862 --> 01:18:01,762
what you and your friend have in mind,

1159
01:18:01,864 --> 01:18:04,025
but please count me out of it, will you?

1160
01:18:04,567 --> 01:18:07,127
- I think I better leave.
- I'm sorry.

1161
01:18:08,438 --> 01:18:11,896
You're not bad at all.
You're the quiet type, aren't you?

1162
01:18:12,008 --> 01:18:13,669
Not the wolf type.

1163
01:18:14,911 --> 01:18:16,902
May I walk with you?

1164
01:18:17,247 --> 01:18:20,011
Now, you see,
why did you have to spoil everything?

1165
01:18:20,116 --> 01:18:24,382
Just like the other sailors.
My answer is the same to everyone.

1166
01:18:24,687 --> 01:18:25,676
No.

1167
01:18:27,223 --> 01:18:28,622
Hello, Corinne.

1168
01:18:28,725 --> 01:18:30,317
How about me taking you
to the base gym tonight

1169
01:18:30,426 --> 01:18:31,950
to see the Navy Relief Smoker?

1170
01:18:32,061 --> 01:18:34,461
Sailor, I'd love to,
but this is a public appearance,

1171
01:18:34,564 --> 01:18:37,897
- not a private one.
- Yeah, and excuse me, sir, I'm with her.

1172
01:18:38,001 --> 01:18:39,559
Oh, go pick a coconut, sailor.

1173
01:18:39,669 --> 01:18:42,467
- Oh, no, I have an appointment with her.
- Well, I just cancelled it.

1174
01:18:42,572 --> 01:18:44,665
What do you mean by barging in
when I'm talking to a lady?

1175
01:18:44,774 --> 01:18:46,901
Shove off before
I belt you where you breathe!

1176
01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:49,137
Take your hand off me.
You're wrinkling this suit.

1177
01:18:49,245 --> 01:18:50,371
Now, stop, both of you!

1178
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,505
- You coward, hiding behind a lady.
- Why, you!

1179
01:18:52,615 --> 01:18:54,947
All right, men, that's enough.
There'll be no brawling in public.

1180
01:18:55,051 --> 01:18:57,542
- What seems to be the trouble, Melvin?
- No trouble, Al.

1181
01:18:57,654 --> 01:19:00,350
It's a good thing you came along,
Lieutenant. I'd have smashed him.

1182
01:19:00,456 --> 01:19:02,822
I'm Lieutenant Conners,
Base Recreation Officer.

1183
01:19:03,092 --> 01:19:05,287
There's no use wasting a good fight.

1184
01:19:05,395 --> 01:19:07,386
You fellas can settle your score
at the base gym tonight.

1185
01:19:07,497 --> 01:19:09,089
I'd have given him the old one-two, Al.

1186
01:19:09,198 --> 01:19:11,166
Three, four, seven, eight, nine.

1187
01:19:11,267 --> 01:19:13,963
- The base gym?
- The fights start at 8:00.

1188
01:19:14,504 --> 01:19:16,904
And you better be there
promptly, too, buddy.

1189
01:19:17,006 --> 01:19:20,407
- And if I ain't there, start without me.
- Come on, Melvin.

1190
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:22,569
Well, he started it, Al.
I would've given him a shot...

1191
01:19:28,518 --> 01:19:30,110
Why'd you put
the bandage on my hands

1192
01:19:30,219 --> 01:19:31,652
before you put the gloves on?

1193
01:19:31,754 --> 01:19:34,018
So when you hit him,
you won't break your knuckles.

1194
01:19:34,691 --> 01:19:36,090
Why don't you put some on my shoes

1195
01:19:36,192 --> 01:19:38,660
so I won't wear them out
from running away from him?

1196
01:19:38,761 --> 01:19:41,559
Now, look, Melvin, half the fights are
won in the locker room.

1197
01:19:41,664 --> 01:19:44,792
- You got to wage psychological warfare.
- What?

1198
01:19:45,868 --> 01:19:49,463
He's just as scared as you are.
Act like this is nothing to you.

1199
01:19:49,572 --> 01:19:51,938
Make him believe you've been a fighter
all your life.

1200
01:19:53,142 --> 01:19:55,906
Then he'll be so scared that when
you lift your arm, he'll fall right down.

1201
01:19:56,012 --> 01:19:57,001
Yeah?

1202
01:19:57,113 --> 01:19:59,081
I wouldn't let anything happen to you,
would I?

1203
01:19:59,182 --> 01:20:00,649
We'll soon find out.

1204
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:03,184
Put on the act right now. Go ahead.

1205
01:20:03,286 --> 01:20:05,481
Listen, Melvin,
how long you been fighting?

1206
01:20:05,588 --> 01:20:06,953
Oh...

1207
01:20:08,491 --> 01:20:11,927
I been fighting now
for about sisteen years.

1208
01:20:12,028 --> 01:20:13,461
- Sisteen?
- Yeah.

1209
01:20:13,563 --> 01:20:16,293
- Oh, it's about sisteen years.
- Sisteen. What do you mean?

1210
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:18,663
- Sisteen. Fourteen, fifteen, sisteen.
- Sisteen.

1211
01:20:18,768 --> 01:20:21,965
Oh, sure. How many fights have you
had altogether?

1212
01:20:22,071 --> 01:20:23,402
Oh...

1213
01:20:24,507 --> 01:20:27,772
Altogether now, when you add them up,
I had

1214
01:20:27,877 --> 01:20:30,539
- 101 fights.101.
- Yeah.

1215
01:20:30,646 --> 01:20:33,137
- I win them all but a hundred.
- Good.

1216
01:20:33,249 --> 01:20:36,150
Where... Let's see,
where are you from originally?

1217
01:20:37,687 --> 01:20:38,949
- Oh, I moved.
- You moved?

1218
01:20:39,055 --> 01:20:41,421
Yeah. Originally I come from
Newark, New Jersey.

1219
01:20:41,524 --> 01:20:42,923
That's my hometown.

1220
01:20:43,025 --> 01:20:44,686
And I started fighting there,
I was just a kid.

1221
01:20:44,794 --> 01:20:46,489
- I think I was...
- How old were you?

1222
01:20:46,596 --> 01:20:49,224
- Oh, about sisteen years old.
- Sisteen?

1223
01:20:49,332 --> 01:20:52,324
- Like before. Fourteen, fifteen, sisteen.
- Sisteen. Yeah, sure.

1224
01:20:52,435 --> 01:20:54,096
Well, who was your toughest fight?

1225
01:20:56,873 --> 01:21:00,331
The toughest fight I had was
with Gene Tierney.

1226
01:21:00,443 --> 01:21:02,035
- That was the toughest fight.
- Gene Tierney.

1227
01:21:02,145 --> 01:21:03,578
You mean Gene Tunney.

1228
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:05,874
You fight who you want,
I fight who I want.

1229
01:21:05,982 --> 01:21:07,916
Oh, yeah, I got it. Listen...

1230
01:21:10,153 --> 01:21:13,486
You know, there are a lot of different
types of fighters in here, right?

1231
01:21:13,589 --> 01:21:16,422
There're body punchers
and left hookers.

1232
01:21:16,526 --> 01:21:19,120
- What are you, a boxer?
- No, I'm a cocker spaniel.

1233
01:21:19,228 --> 01:21:21,162
What do you think I am?
Sure, I'm a boxer.

1234
01:21:21,264 --> 01:21:24,495
- I'm a very, very crowd-pleasing boxer.
- Crowd pleasing?

1235
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:27,262
Crowd-pleasing. I was fighting about
two and a half months ago

1236
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:29,463
- at the Howwood Wegion in California.
- Howwood Wegion?

1237
01:21:29,572 --> 01:21:30,800
- The Howwood Wegion.
- Howwood Wegion.

1238
01:21:30,907 --> 01:21:32,374
- Howwood Wegion in California.
- The Howwood Wegion?

1239
01:21:32,475 --> 01:21:35,171
- The Hollywood Legion in California.
- California! Oh.

1240
01:21:35,278 --> 01:21:36,245
I'm fighting there.

1241
01:21:36,345 --> 01:21:38,210
I'm sitting in my dressing room,
minding my own business.

1242
01:21:38,314 --> 01:21:40,578
A guy came backstage and says to me.
He says to me,

1243
01:21:40,683 --> 01:21:43,015
"Kid, I'll give you
a tousand dollars if you do..."

1244
01:21:43,119 --> 01:21:45,178
No, he said he'd give you
a thousand dollars.

1245
01:21:46,656 --> 01:21:49,989
- He said he'd give me a tousand dollars.
- A thousand dollars.

1246
01:21:50,092 --> 01:21:51,992
- Oh, you know him?
- No, I don't know him.

1247
01:21:52,094 --> 01:21:54,358
Oh, well, he offered me
a tousand dollars. I said...

1248
01:21:54,464 --> 01:21:56,193
Thousand dollars, he offered you.

1249
01:21:56,299 --> 01:21:57,857
- Tousand dollars.
- Thousand.

1250
01:21:57,967 --> 01:22:01,425
- Tou.
- T-H-O-U-S-A-N-D. Thousand.

1251
01:22:02,572 --> 01:22:04,870
Thou, thou, thousand.

1252
01:22:04,974 --> 01:22:06,441
- Thousand.
- Tousand dollars.

1253
01:22:06,542 --> 01:22:07,736
- Thousand.
- Kid, this is tough.

1254
01:22:07,844 --> 01:22:09,277
- It was ten hundred dollars.
- Ten hundred dollars!

1255
01:22:09,378 --> 01:22:12,040
Ten hundred dollars. I said,
"What I gotta do for this money?"

1256
01:22:12,148 --> 01:22:14,708
He said, "I'll give you the money
if you'll lay down in round two."

1257
01:22:14,817 --> 01:22:16,648
Well, I had turned it down, naturally,

1258
01:22:16,752 --> 01:22:18,379
because I never went
that distance before.

1259
01:22:18,488 --> 01:22:19,978
Oh, yes, it's a long way to go.

1260
01:22:20,089 --> 01:22:21,386
Hey, that guy's a professional.

1261
01:22:21,491 --> 01:22:23,288
Gee whiz, I can't fight a professional.

1262
01:22:23,392 --> 01:22:25,383
Why, that wouldn't be fair.
He's ring-wise.

1263
01:22:25,495 --> 01:22:27,326
Say, come on in
to the other dressing room.

1264
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:28,658
I got an idea.

1265
01:22:28,764 --> 01:22:30,061
- Good.
- I tell you one thing, though,

1266
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:32,691
the best fight I ever had in my whole life
was three years ago

1267
01:22:32,802 --> 01:22:34,565
- in Por Orga.
- Where?

1268
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:36,570
- In Por Orga.
- Por Orga?

1269
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:38,162
- I was... Por Orga.
- Por Orga.

1270
01:22:38,274 --> 01:22:41,766
- Por Orga! Por Orga!
- Oh, Portland, Oregon.

1271
01:22:41,878 --> 01:22:45,314
- That wasn't so hard now, was it?
- No, it wasn't hard.

1272
01:22:45,414 --> 01:22:48,713
Well, I got in the ring with that guy.
I don't forget that night, boy.

1273
01:22:48,818 --> 01:22:51,343
I get the guy. I get one, two, three, four.

1274
01:22:51,454 --> 01:22:54,048
And I thought I had him down that time
and I hit him a shot.

1275
01:22:54,156 --> 01:22:55,282
Melvin!

1276
01:22:55,391 --> 01:22:57,960
Hey! They've gone.

1277
01:22:58,194 --> 01:23:01,027
Oh, what am I gonna do, Al?

1278
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:02,597
Don't worry about it.

1279
01:23:03,466 --> 01:23:06,492
- Look, I'm gonna teach you what to do.
- Yeah, because I don't know.

1280
01:23:06,602 --> 01:23:09,036
No, I'm gonna teach you to fight
in about a few seconds.

1281
01:23:09,138 --> 01:23:11,834
Come over here. We'll pretend
that this is the squared circle. Right?

1282
01:23:11,941 --> 01:23:14,341
- Yeah, yeah, what do I do?
- Always protect yourself.

1283
01:23:14,443 --> 01:23:16,604
Put your guard up like that.
Put up your guard.

1284
01:23:16,712 --> 01:23:18,236
- Yeah.
- Right, put this up. Right.

1285
01:23:18,481 --> 01:23:20,949
- Now, I hit you in the stomach.
- Why? Why?

1286
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:22,779
Well, you hit me.

1287
01:23:22,885 --> 01:23:26,321
Why? 'Cause it wasn't protected.
Always protect your stomach.

1288
01:23:26,422 --> 01:23:27,411
Now watch. Put up...

1289
01:23:27,523 --> 01:23:30,083
Hit you on the head. Why? Why?

1290
01:23:30,293 --> 01:23:32,727
It wasn't protected.
You gotta protect it at the same time.

1291
01:23:32,828 --> 01:23:35,353
Up, down. Up, down. Protect.
Up, one. Watch.

1292
01:23:35,464 --> 01:23:37,864
The head, head. Stomach, stomach.
Head, stomach.

1293
01:23:37,967 --> 01:23:40,458
Gotta watch yourself all the time, see?
Watch what you're doing.

1294
01:23:40,570 --> 01:23:41,935
- Oh, that's good.
- Understand?

1295
01:23:42,038 --> 01:23:43,630
- Yeah.
- Now, any other questions?

1296
01:23:43,739 --> 01:23:46,264
Yeah, well, what happens
if we're in the ring

1297
01:23:46,375 --> 01:23:49,242
- and he hugs me?
- He doesn't hug you. That's a clinch.

1298
01:23:49,345 --> 01:23:50,869
- Yeah?
- Like this, watch.

1299
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:53,005
Now, we're gonna watch this hand.
Look, watch that hand.

1300
01:23:53,115 --> 01:23:56,084
- Yeah, I'm watching it.
- No, protect it, not watch it.

1301
01:23:56,185 --> 01:23:58,619
Protect yourself
with this other hand, here,

1302
01:23:58,721 --> 01:24:00,484
and he'll hit you in the stomach
like that.

1303
01:24:00,590 --> 01:24:02,581
- Oh, I see. Yeah.
- Always protect yourself at all times.

1304
01:24:02,692 --> 01:24:05,627
Well, what happens when
this happens? I hit him? What'll he do?

1305
01:24:05,728 --> 01:24:06,922
He does this!

1306
01:24:12,535 --> 01:24:13,502
Hey!

1307
01:24:13,603 --> 01:24:14,695
Hey!

1308
01:24:14,804 --> 01:24:15,771
Hey!

1309
01:24:16,672 --> 01:24:18,401
I didn't even hit you.

1310
01:24:19,375 --> 01:24:21,809
- 'Cause you like me?
- Come on, let's go in the ring.

1311
01:24:21,911 --> 01:24:23,242
- I know what to do now, Al.
- You sure?

1312
01:24:23,346 --> 01:24:24,608
- Yeah.
- Come on.

1313
01:24:34,290 --> 01:24:36,554
You let me know how the fight turns out.

1314
01:24:36,659 --> 01:24:39,321
- Come on.
- Good luck, Melvin.

1315
01:24:41,697 --> 01:24:44,598
Boy, is this gonna be a slaughter.

1316
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:46,224
Come on, let's go, Melvin.

1317
01:24:47,937 --> 01:24:49,700
Get in through here.

1318
01:24:52,141 --> 01:24:54,974
Oh, I'm sorry, kid. Come on, get up.

1319
01:24:55,077 --> 01:24:57,341
What for?
I'll be back down here in a minute.

1320
01:24:57,446 --> 01:25:00,506
He hasn't got a chance against us.

1321
01:25:00,616 --> 01:25:02,379
We'll lick him. We'll murder him.

1322
01:25:02,485 --> 01:25:04,453
Gee, I wish we had this fight
in the hospital

1323
01:25:04,553 --> 01:25:06,111
so I could be nearer the medicine.

1324
01:25:07,056 --> 01:25:08,318
Oh, look!

1325
01:25:12,461 --> 01:25:14,952
That's not the guy
I was supposed to fight.

1326
01:25:15,064 --> 01:25:16,827
Well, maybe
the other guy didn't feel good.

1327
01:25:16,932 --> 01:25:19,730
- I don't feel good, either.
- Oh, Melvin, after all,

1328
01:25:19,835 --> 01:25:21,564
if it wasn't all right,
he wouldn't be in there.

1329
01:25:21,671 --> 01:25:23,195
They have rules, you know.

1330
01:25:23,706 --> 01:25:26,573
Everybody makes rules
how I should get beat up.

1331
01:25:27,743 --> 01:25:30,405
The next bout presenting
four rounds of boxing.

1332
01:25:30,513 --> 01:25:34,449
In this corner at 137 and a quarter,
Melvin Jones!

1333
01:25:48,064 --> 01:25:52,262
And his opponent in this corner
at 175 pounds,

1334
01:25:52,368 --> 01:25:53,699
Killer Jackson!

1335
01:25:59,141 --> 01:26:01,041
You weren't the guy
that was mad at me.

1336
01:26:01,143 --> 01:26:02,542
That was me kid brother.

1337
01:26:02,645 --> 01:26:05,170
We heard you was a pro,
so I'm substituting.

1338
01:26:05,281 --> 01:26:08,512
That's enough talk, boys.
Now, I want a good, clean fight.

1339
01:26:08,617 --> 01:26:11,415
Anyone knocked down,
I want you to go to a neutral corner.

1340
01:26:11,954 --> 01:26:14,718
No rabbit punches,
no hitting below the belt.

1341
01:26:15,091 --> 01:26:16,991
And keep your thumbs in.

1342
01:26:17,193 --> 01:26:18,820
Shake hands now, go to your corners

1343
01:26:18,928 --> 01:26:20,327
and come out fighting.

1344
01:26:24,266 --> 01:26:26,461
Remember, we're gonna give him
everything we got.

1345
01:26:27,837 --> 01:26:31,000
- What's that for?
- He said no hitting below the belt.

1346
01:26:31,107 --> 01:26:32,233
Come on, put that back in.

1347
01:26:32,341 --> 01:26:33,740
Now remember, we're going to give him
the old one-two.

1348
01:26:33,843 --> 01:26:35,538
- Open your mouth.
- What's that for?

1349
01:26:35,644 --> 01:26:37,805
That's so if he hits us,
he won't knock our teeth out.

1350
01:26:37,913 --> 01:26:39,210
Knock our teeth out.

1351
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:52,254
Look at that.

1352
01:26:52,795 --> 01:26:55,286
One, two,

1353
01:26:55,397 --> 01:26:58,730
three, four, five.

1354
01:26:58,934 --> 01:27:00,458
I wasn't ready.

1355
01:27:32,902 --> 01:27:34,927
Melvin, get up!

1356
01:27:35,037 --> 01:27:39,303
Three, four, five, six.

1357
01:27:39,408 --> 01:27:40,739
Foul, foul.

1358
01:27:40,843 --> 01:27:42,868
- Let's go, Jones.
- Where we going?

1359
01:27:42,978 --> 01:27:44,343
Quit stalling and get in and mix it up.

1360
01:27:45,781 --> 01:27:47,681
- Foul.
- Quit stalling.

1361
01:27:47,783 --> 01:27:50,081
- Get in and mix it up.
- Foul!

1362
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:18,732
Melvin, wake up here. Wake up.

1363
01:29:18,841 --> 01:29:22,470
It's so nice here.
Just the two of us in the moonlight.

1364
01:29:22,578 --> 01:29:24,307
All alone.

1365
01:29:26,548 --> 01:29:29,016
And by the ocean.

1366
01:29:29,285 --> 01:29:32,652
Come on. There, we'll get him this time.

1367
01:29:38,894 --> 01:29:40,384
Get up here and fight!

1368
01:29:40,496 --> 01:29:43,829
- I have my own strategy.
- Go on in that corner.

1369
01:29:43,933 --> 01:29:48,063
One, two, three, four.

1370
01:29:48,170 --> 01:29:49,797
- Come on, Melvin!
- Five.

1371
01:30:12,528 --> 01:30:14,359
Get up. Get up off the floor, Melvin.

1372
01:30:28,744 --> 01:30:30,371
Melvin, get up!

1373
01:30:30,713 --> 01:30:32,874
Look, Melvin, get up off the floor!

1374
01:30:36,552 --> 01:30:37,883
Come on, Melvin, let's go.

1375
01:31:07,049 --> 01:31:08,038
One,

1376
01:31:08,150 --> 01:31:11,642
two, three, four, five,

1377
01:31:11,754 --> 01:31:15,918
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1378
01:31:20,229 --> 01:31:22,026
Oh, I didn't mean to do it.

1379
01:31:28,604 --> 01:31:30,936
Atta boy, atta boy, Melvin.

1380
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:34,134
- I hope he's not mad at me.
- Oh, I thought for a while he had us,

1381
01:31:34,243 --> 01:31:36,973
but we took care of him.
Come on, let's get in the dressing room.

1382
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:40,371
Come on, Melvin.
Watch your step here now.

1383
01:31:42,017 --> 01:31:43,416
Watch it.

1384
01:31:44,853 --> 01:31:46,286
How do you feel?

1385
01:31:46,655 --> 01:31:48,520
I could go another 10 rounds.

1386
01:31:48,624 --> 01:31:51,058
Atta boy. How about that fight, huh?

1387
01:31:56,965 --> 01:31:58,796
How do you like that?

1388
01:31:59,468 --> 01:32:01,936
Hey, maybe I'd better go in and check
and see what lover boy is doing.

1389
01:32:02,037 --> 01:32:04,767
Okay.
But don't go too far with those bets.

1390
01:32:04,873 --> 01:32:06,397
- Don't worry.
- Hey, what gives?

1391
01:32:06,508 --> 01:32:08,999
- I thought this thing was in the bag.
- Oh, it was just tough luck.

1392
01:32:09,111 --> 01:32:11,136
I thought the Killer was gonna
take care of him.

1393
01:32:11,246 --> 01:32:12,770
But now, it's up to you guys to see that

1394
01:32:12,881 --> 01:32:15,042
he doesn't get to the party to
see Corinne.

1395
01:32:15,417 --> 01:32:17,715
After all, you guys got dough
bet on him, too, you know.

1396
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:19,583
Sure, but what're we gonna do about it?

1397
01:32:19,688 --> 01:32:22,486
- Just keep him out of circulation.
- How?

1398
01:32:22,591 --> 01:32:24,752
Figure it out for yourselves.

1399
01:32:25,327 --> 01:32:28,023
These ain't Red Cross armbands,
you know.

1400
01:32:28,564 --> 01:32:29,622
Okay.

1401
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:34,128
Come on, Melvin,
we still have two hours to win that bet.

1402
01:32:34,236 --> 01:32:35,203
Hey, Melvin.

1403
01:32:35,304 --> 01:32:37,431
Some SPs are trying to keep you
from getting to that luau.

1404
01:32:37,539 --> 01:32:39,939
- How do you know?
- Lardoski talked them into it.

1405
01:32:40,042 --> 01:32:41,737
Let's get to the beach.
Corinne'll be there.

1406
01:32:41,844 --> 01:32:43,835
- Come on, it's our only chance.
- Not that way, Al.

1407
01:32:43,946 --> 01:32:46,915
- They're waiting outside.
- Then how am I gonna get out of here?

1408
01:32:49,184 --> 01:32:50,947
Oh, no, fellas.

1409
01:32:51,053 --> 01:32:53,317
Oh, come on, Melvin,
we haven't got much time.

1410
01:32:53,422 --> 01:32:55,322
Well, they're gonna recognize me
like this.

1411
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:57,619
We'll figure out something
so they won't recognize you.

1412
01:32:57,993 --> 01:32:59,620
Upsy Daisy, that's it.

1413
01:33:26,155 --> 01:33:28,146
Look at that bunch of wolves.

1414
01:33:28,257 --> 01:33:30,919
- And I want to get thrown to them.
- Oh, now, wait a minute.

1415
01:33:31,026 --> 01:33:33,085
Remember what I told you
about sailors?

1416
01:33:33,195 --> 01:33:34,492
I remember.

1417
01:33:34,596 --> 01:33:36,427
Why do you think
I want to get thrown to them?

1418
01:33:40,435 --> 01:33:43,404
<i>Never before</i>

1419
01:33:43,805 --> 01:33:48,299
<i>Has my heart felt a thrill like this</i>

1420
01:33:49,311 --> 01:33:51,643
<i>Never before</i>

1421
01:33:54,116 --> 01:33:57,051
<i>Never before</i>

1422
01:34:00,489 --> 01:34:03,822
<i>Never before</i>

1423
01:34:03,926 --> 01:34:08,260
<i>Has the whole world stood still like this</i>

1424
01:34:09,298 --> 01:34:12,756
<i>As I gaze at the face</i>

1425
01:34:14,069 --> 01:34:17,527
<i>I simply adore</i>

1426
01:34:20,742 --> 01:34:23,302
<i>After today</i>

1427
01:34:23,912 --> 01:34:28,576
<i>When they speak about paradise</i>

1428
01:34:29,952 --> 01:34:33,444
<i>I'll smile and I'll say</i>

1429
01:34:34,022 --> 01:34:35,922
<i>I've been there</i>

1430
01:34:36,024 --> 01:34:39,585
<i>Once or twice</i>

1431
01:34:41,830 --> 01:34:46,494
<i>For this is that once in a lifetime</i>

1432
01:34:47,069 --> 01:34:52,006
<i>The miracle of your kiss</i>

1433
01:34:52,808 --> 01:34:56,539
<i>I've never loved like this</i>

1434
01:34:57,646 --> 01:35:02,583
<i>Never before</i>

1435
01:35:07,723 --> 01:35:10,385
His singing kind of gets you. I mean...

1436
01:35:10,492 --> 01:35:13,052
I know what you mean. It gets me, too.

1437
01:35:14,062 --> 01:35:17,520
- I like him when he sings.
- Were you listening?

1438
01:35:17,633 --> 01:35:19,328
It was nice.

1439
01:35:19,434 --> 01:35:22,164
I hope you didn't think I was rude
in the Mango Room.

1440
01:35:22,638 --> 01:35:24,128
Oh, I can easily forget all about it

1441
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:25,763
if you'll take a stroll with me
down along the beach.

1442
01:35:25,874 --> 01:35:28,172
I thought this was a public appearance.

1443
01:35:28,277 --> 01:35:30,643
It is. He's my public.

1444
01:35:41,089 --> 01:35:43,182
I don't see why the chief needs
so many men

1445
01:35:43,292 --> 01:35:45,726
- just to catch one poor guy.
- Neither do I.

1446
01:35:45,827 --> 01:35:47,488
Drop us off here, fella.

1447
01:35:47,929 --> 01:35:50,557
Drop off, very quick. Chop, chop.

1448
01:35:55,837 --> 01:35:59,170
- I'm glad I changed my mind.
- You mean about hating sailors?

1449
01:35:59,274 --> 01:36:01,765
Well, you can't blame a girl
for being cautious.

1450
01:36:01,877 --> 01:36:04,869
- After all, how do I know when...
- When you're in love?

1451
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:07,813
- Now, wait a minute. I didn't say that.
- Well, you shouldn't.

1452
01:36:07,916 --> 01:36:09,645
I ought to bring it up first.

1453
01:36:09,751 --> 01:36:12,481
You see, a guy says,
"All my life I've been waiting for you."

1454
01:36:12,587 --> 01:36:14,782
The girl says, "You have?"
He says, "Yeah."

1455
01:36:14,890 --> 01:36:16,414
Before you know it, you're in love.

1456
01:36:16,525 --> 01:36:19,892
And I know, because all my life
I've been waiting for someone like you.

1457
01:36:19,995 --> 01:36:23,123
- You have?
- Stop. Don't kiss him. Don't kiss him.

1458
01:36:23,231 --> 01:36:25,699
- Why?
- I just heard tonight there's a bet on

1459
01:36:25,801 --> 01:36:28,463
that a certain sailor will kiss you,
and half the fleet's in on it.

1460
01:36:28,570 --> 01:36:30,333
Who could resist kissing you?

1461
01:36:30,439 --> 01:36:31,872
I'm so sorry.

1462
01:36:31,973 --> 01:36:34,339
You almost won
a lot of money for your sailor friends.

1463
01:36:34,443 --> 01:36:35,933
Kissing me? Now, wait a minute.

1464
01:36:36,044 --> 01:36:37,705
Too bad,
you are just like the rest of them.

1465
01:36:37,913 --> 01:36:40,404
- Corinne, look...
- Stay out of my way, will you?

1466
01:36:41,183 --> 01:36:42,775
That's for all you men.

1467
01:37:02,904 --> 01:37:05,031
Very quick, very quick. Chop, chop.

1468
01:38:18,013 --> 01:38:19,947
- <i>Aloha.</i>
- Same to you.

1469
01:39:48,103 --> 01:39:50,071
- Have you seen anything of Jones?
- Nope.

1470
01:39:50,171 --> 01:39:53,334
Nobody went by me
but one of them Hawaiian dancers.

1471
01:39:53,441 --> 01:39:54,806
Which one?

1472
01:39:55,243 --> 01:39:56,403
That one.

1473
01:41:09,451 --> 01:41:10,918
It's Melvin.

1474
01:41:13,888 --> 01:41:16,083
- That's Melvin.
- That's Jones.

1475
01:41:17,726 --> 01:41:20,422
Shore patrol, shore patrol! Come on.

1476
01:41:46,655 --> 01:41:49,556
Run for it! They can't catch us.
Come on, run!

1477
01:41:49,658 --> 01:41:51,421
We can run faster than that.

1478
01:41:51,526 --> 01:41:55,087
Run, Melvin, run! Atta boy! Run!

1479
01:41:58,967 --> 01:42:01,561
- Leave me alone.
- Stop it. All of you.

1480
01:42:01,670 --> 01:42:04,503
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves
running after this little boy?

1481
01:42:04,606 --> 01:42:06,130
- Leave him alone.
- But he was

1482
01:42:06,241 --> 01:42:08,505
out of uniform and disturbing the peace.

1483
01:42:08,610 --> 01:42:10,771
He was entertaining the guests.

1484
01:42:10,879 --> 01:42:12,506
This is a party.

1485
01:42:12,614 --> 01:42:14,673
Are you hurt, little boy?

1486
01:42:17,152 --> 01:42:19,416
She kissed me! I won the bet!

1487
01:42:21,356 --> 01:42:22,823
- I won the bet!
- Sure.

1488
01:42:22,924 --> 01:42:24,391
You mean it wasn't Al?

1489
01:42:24,492 --> 01:42:26,756
No, they were betting I could kiss you.

1490
01:42:26,861 --> 01:42:28,726
Oh, you don't know how glad I am.

1491
01:42:28,830 --> 01:42:30,627
I could really kiss you for telling me this.

1492
01:42:30,732 --> 01:42:33,326
- Then what're you waiting for?
- All right.

1493
01:42:36,771 --> 01:42:38,136
Yay, Melvin!

1494
01:42:38,406 --> 01:42:40,897
- Hey.
- Oh, we won the bet, Al!

1495
01:42:43,745 --> 01:42:44,712
We won.

1496
01:42:52,687 --> 01:42:54,552
Gee, when you kiss me, I like it.

1497
01:42:54,856 --> 01:42:56,915
The other girls inflame my uvula.

1498
01:42:58,460 --> 01:43:00,621
Hurry it up, men. We're shoving off.

1499
01:43:01,296 --> 01:43:04,527
- Look, honey, we can't hold up the Navy.
- Wait a minute, Al.

1500
01:43:09,504 --> 01:43:11,495
That'll hold you for four years.
So long, sugar.

1501
01:43:11,606 --> 01:43:15,064
Why, you no good two-timer.
That's the same thing you told me.

1502
01:43:16,878 --> 01:43:18,937
Hey, Mel! Come on, Melvin.

1503
01:43:19,047 --> 01:43:21,106
- Go!
- Hey, it's Hetty Button.

1504
01:43:21,916 --> 01:43:24,146
Melvin, you're just like all the others.

1505
01:43:24,252 --> 01:43:26,720
I'll teach you. Double-crossing me.

1506
01:43:26,821 --> 01:43:28,982
Mother told me to beware of sailors.
