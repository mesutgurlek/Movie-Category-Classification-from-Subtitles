1
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:02,974
<i>? Well, now?</i>

2
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:05,204
<i>? Ain't this
an elegant neighborhood??</i>

3
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:08,304
<i>? All the residents
dress so fine?</i>

4
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:13,683
<i>? One day off the boat am I
with a job that's nearly mine?</i>

5
00:06:13,753 --> 00:06:16,779
<i>? 'Tis a job with
an elegant millionaire?</i>

6
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:19,791
<i>? And his elegant family?</i>

7
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:31,635
<i>? Today I move from immigrant
to high society?</i>

8
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:33,468
Now, you may call that luck.

9
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,167
And you may call it fortune.

10
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:37,106
But me, meself...

11
00:06:37,444 --> 00:06:43,178
<i>? I call it?</i>

12
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:45,843
<i>? Fortuosity?</i>

13
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,717
<i>? That's me byword?</i>

14
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:50,653
<i>? Fortuosity?</i>

15
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:53,887
<i>? Me twinkle-in-the-eye word?</i>

16
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,159
<i>? Sometimes castles
fall to the ground?</i>

17
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:04,864
<i>? But that's where
four-leaf clovers abound?</i>

18
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:07,067
<i>? Fortuosity?</i>

19
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:10,699
<i>? Lucky chances?</i>

20
00:07:10,777 --> 00:07:16,875
<i>? Fortuitious little
happy happenstances?</i>

21
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,389
<i>? I don't worry
'cause everywhere I see?</i>

22
00:07:32,465 --> 00:07:37,835
<i>? That every bit of life
is lit by fortuosity?</i>

23
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:07,364
<i>? Fortuosity?</i>

24
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:09,594
<i>? That's me own word?</i>

25
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:11,796
<i>? Fortuosity?</i>

26
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:15,307
<i>? Me never-feel-alone word?</i>

27
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:20,244
<i>? Round the corner,
under a tree?</i>

28
00:08:20,313 --> 00:08:23,510
<i>? Good fortune's waitin'?</i>

29
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,416
<i>? Just wait and see?</i>

30
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:29,387
<i>? Fortuosity?</i>

31
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:32,015
<i>? Lucky chances?</i>

32
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:37,085
<i>? Fortuitious little
happy happenstances?</i>

33
00:08:37,163 --> 00:08:42,396
<i>? I keep smilin'
'cause my philosophy?</i>

34
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:45,062
<i>? Is do your best
and leave the rest?</i>

35
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:48,665
<i>? To fortuosity?</i>

36
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:48,393
<i>? I keep smilin'
'cause my philosophy?</i>

37
00:09:48,468 --> 00:09:51,130
<i>? Is do your best
and leave the rest?</i>

38
00:09:51,204 --> 00:10:00,044
<i>? To fortuosity?</i>

39
00:10:00,113 --> 00:10:01,910
Good day to you, ma'am.

40
00:10:02,415 --> 00:10:05,680
Would this be the home of
Mr. Anthony J. Drexel Biddle?

41
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:06,548
It would.

42
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:09,747
I've come to be interviewed
for the position of the butler.

43
00:10:09,822 --> 00:10:11,653
Mrs. Biddle
does the interviewin'.

44
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:13,021
She's not at home just now.

45
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:15,890
But I had an appointment.
The Mayflower Employment Agency.

46
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:18,522
I'll tell Mrs. Biddle that
you were put out about it.

47
00:10:18,598 --> 00:10:20,532
Oh.
Not at all.

48
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,535
I'd be pleased to call again.

49
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:25,865
Good day to ya.

50
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:28,533
What part of Ireland?

51
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:30,336
County Tyrone.

52
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,173
Just new here, are ya?

53
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:34,509
The day before yesterday.

54
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,380
Oh, well, perhaps you'd like
to wait in the kitchen.

55
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:40,749
Mrs. Biddle
will be comin' home soon.

56
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,288
That's very kind of you.
Thank you very much.

57
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:02,932
Faith, 'tis a grand place
you have here.

58
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:04,943
I'm the housekeeper here.

59
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:06,706
Me name's Mrs. Worth.

60
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:08,246
Mine's John Lawless.

61
00:11:08,314 --> 00:11:10,714
This way, John Lawless.

62
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:15,917
Have a seat,
and I'll pour you some coffee.

63
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:17,616
Don't you be troubling yourself.

64
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,714
No trouble.

65
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,759
There's a pot
brewing on the stove.

66
00:11:20,827 --> 00:11:22,419
Sit down.

67
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:27,429
Would you be from Ireland
yourself, Mrs. Worth?

68
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,695
I came over as young girl.

69
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:31,464
Not long ago, then.

70
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,836
Tell me, Mrs. Worth, what
became of the last butler?

71
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,638
I couldn't say.

72
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:40,770
He left in the dead of night

73
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:44,374
after being here
less than a month.

74
00:11:44,817 --> 00:11:47,342
We've got a servant problem
in this house.

75
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,047
No use sayin' we don't.

76
00:11:49,122 --> 00:11:51,249
Must be hard working
for the very rich.

77
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:53,952
I mean, they're accustomed
to havin' things just so.

78
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:56,757
That's not exactly the problem.

79
00:11:57,864 --> 00:11:59,991
The wage is very low.

80
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:04,002
No, the Biddles
are generous enough.

81
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,762
Long hours, then?

82
00:12:05,838 --> 00:12:08,363
I wouldn't say so.

83
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:11,542
There's a gorgeous sight.

84
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:13,476
Are you getting ready
for a party?

85
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:17,107
No, Mr. Biddle's
on a chocolate-cake diet.

86
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:18,445
I beg your pardon?

87
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:19,780
Cordelia!

88
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:21,581
He says it's the perfect food,

89
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:25,351
containing every
essential element.

90
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:26,783
Where is Mrs. Biddle?

91
00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:28,224
She's gone shopping.

92
00:12:28,294 --> 00:12:29,693
Blast!
And Cordy?

93
00:12:29,762 --> 00:12:31,457
- I couldn't say.
- And the boys?

94
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:33,294
I haven't seen them since lunch.

95
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:34,663
At a time like this.

96
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:36,065
No one!

97
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:38,194
Is there something
I could do, Mr. Biddle?

98
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,932
Yes.
You can call Dr. Donleavy.

99
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:41,837
Tell him I've been bit
by an alligator.

100
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:43,569
Oh, dear!

101
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:47,345
Might as well live alone.

102
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,804
Are you a married man?

103
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:49,848
Me, sir?
No, sir.

104
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,713
Then you wouldn't understand.

105
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:54,511
<i>? I've been bit on my finger?</i>

106
00:12:54,587 --> 00:12:56,350
<i>? It could have been my leg?</i>

107
00:12:56,422 --> 00:12:57,980
<i>? It could have been my head?</i>

108
00:12:58,057 --> 00:12:59,957
<i>? I might have died?</i>

109
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:01,823
<i>? In a time of mortal peril?</i>

110
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:03,725
<i>? Any man should expect?</i>

111
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:06,890
<i>? That his family will come
rushing to his side?</i>

112
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:09,196
<i>? What's wrong with that??</i>

113
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:11,065
<i>? What's wrong with that??</i>

114
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:13,037
<i>? My family rushing
to my side?</i>

115
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:14,937
<i>? What's wrong with that??</i>

116
00:13:15,007 --> 00:13:17,134
Oh, not a thing, sir, I'm sure.

117
00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:24,445
<i>? I'm a good-hearted husband?</i>

118
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:26,144
<i>? I'm generous and kind?</i>

119
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:29,313
<i>? No wife could have
a life as free of cares?</i>

120
00:13:29,388 --> 00:13:32,380
<i>? So when a good-hearted
husband has been bit?</i>

121
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,516
<i>? It's only right?</i>

122
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:37,029
<i>? That his wife should share
the agony he bears?</i>

123
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:38,859
<i>? What's wrong with that??</i>

124
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:40,796
<i>? What's wrong with that??</i>

125
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:42,892
<i>? I want my wife
to share my life?</i>

126
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:44,937
<i>? What's wrong with that??</i>

127
00:13:45,004 --> 00:13:46,232
Cordelia!

128
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:49,265
Well, now.

129
00:13:49,342 --> 00:13:52,436
Now, that answers a whole slew
of questions, don't it?

130
00:13:52,512 --> 00:13:54,070
Cordy!

131
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:55,705
Boys!

132
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:58,311
Blast!

133
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:01,148
<i>? Here in this house
I'm raising?</i>

134
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,120
<i>? Three strong,
intelligent children?</i>

135
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:06,886
<i>? Where are they now in
their father's time of need??</i>

136
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,824
<i>? I give them private tutors?</i>

137
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,556
<i>? The finest
physical trainers?</i>

138
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,928
<i>? All in vain?</i>

139
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:15,291
Ohh, the pain!

140
00:14:16,035 --> 00:14:17,662
<i>? I believe in the Bible?</i>

141
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:19,637
<i>? I believe in Uncle Sam?</i>

142
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:23,334
<i>? And as sure
as Old Glory waves above?</i>

143
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:26,936
<i>? I believe a man who's bitten
has the right to demand?</i>

144
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:30,642
<i>? That his family give him
sympathy and love?</i>

145
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:32,513
<i>? What's wrong with that??</i>

146
00:14:32,585 --> 00:14:34,553
<i>? What's wrong with that??</i>

147
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,751
<i>? The flag above,
the Bible, and love?</i>

148
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:41,952
<i>? What's wrong with that??</i>

149
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:43,086
- Hello, Papa.
- Cordy!

150
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:44,356
Where have you been?

151
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,694
Out in the stable
with Tony and Liv.

152
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:49,599
- Is something wrong?
- Yes, something's wrong.

153
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:51,830
What were you doing shaving
at this time of day?

154
00:14:51,904 --> 00:14:52,996
I haven't been shaving.

155
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:54,972
And since when do
I shave my finger?

156
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,633
You don't shave your ear either.

157
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:58,540
- But last week you cut it.
- That's different.

158
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:00,772
The ear is in the general
vicinity of the face.

159
00:15:00,846 --> 00:15:02,336
So's the finger
when you're shaving.

160
00:15:02,415 --> 00:15:04,042
It's a bite, blast it!

161
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:05,310
- No.
- Yes.

162
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:06,942
- Who?
- George.

163
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:10,216
Turned on me just like that
after all these years.

164
00:15:11,324 --> 00:15:15,192
Well, it's really
not such a bad bite.

165
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:17,092
Is that all you have to say?

166
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:19,131
There's some antiseptic
in the emergency kit.

167
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:20,859
- And some bandages.
- Wait a minute.

168
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:23,367
Where are you going?
It's time for Bible class.

169
00:15:23,436 --> 00:15:24,698
Yes, I know.

170
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,601
But you'll have to do
without me today.

171
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:29,106
I have an engagement.

172
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:32,876
Dr. Donleavy's somewhere between
his office and the hospital.

173
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:34,606
Keep trying.

174
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,772
Oh, what are you doing?

175
00:15:35,848 --> 00:15:37,213
Me, sir?
Not a thing, sir.

176
00:15:37,283 --> 00:15:38,841
- Well, do something.
- Yes, sir.

177
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:40,078
Blasted alligator.

178
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:42,313
- I beg your pardon.
- Treated him like a son.

179
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:44,219
What exactly would you
like me to do?

180
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,191
Tell the boys to bring in
that emergency kit.

181
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,658
Out the back door,
across the yard to the stable.

182
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,391
Mr. Tony.
Mr. Livingston.

183
00:15:52,465 --> 00:15:54,365
Mr. Tony and Mr. Livingston.

184
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:56,765
Blasted Benedict Arnold.
That's what he is.

185
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:03,569
Yes?

186
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:06,009
Would you tell Miss Biddle
Mr. Taylor is calling?

187
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:08,876
- Mr. Who?
- Mr. Charles Taylor.

188
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:11,815
Miss Biddle is expecting me.

189
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:21,482
Cordy!

190
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:38,338
Dr. Donleavy must have stopped
to make a house call.

191
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:39,469
I could be dying.

192
00:16:39,545 --> 00:16:41,240
Indeed you could.

193
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:43,508
Where's that blasted antiseptic?

194
00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:44,571
Here you are, Pa.

195
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,880
- It's about time.
- We came as soon as we heard.

196
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:49,318
I left word with
the doctor to call.

197
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:50,412
What happened, Pa?

198
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:51,513
Was it really George?

199
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,557
Gentle old George?

200
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,616
Yes, it was gentle old George.

201
00:16:54,694 --> 00:16:57,288
Hey, Pa, what's
Charlie Taylor doing here?

202
00:16:57,363 --> 00:16:59,058
He came to see Cordy.

203
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:01,361
The answer to a maiden's prayer.

204
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:05,560
What do you know
about maidens' prayers?

205
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:07,503
Nothing, Pa.
It's just an expression.

206
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:08,505
Oh.

207
00:17:08,574 --> 00:17:09,666
But Charlie Taylor?

208
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:12,176
- Cordy can do better than that.
- I'm sure she can.

209
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:14,371
When the time comes.

210
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,081
That's pretty good.
Going into vaudeville?

211
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:27,785
Hi, Tony.
Long time, no see.

212
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,021
- This is my brother, Liv.
- Hiya, sport.

213
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:31,563
Hi.

214
00:17:32,064 --> 00:17:34,089
- Say, that man in the hall.
- Yeah?

215
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,599
That wasn't your father, was it?

216
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:38,603
- Who did you think it was?
- I thought he was some kind...

217
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:40,195
Uh, uh, uh.

218
00:17:40,873 --> 00:17:42,773
Hey, caramel!

219
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,607
They're for Cordy, sport.

220
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:46,838
Cordy hates caramels.

221
00:17:46,912 --> 00:17:48,277
They stick in her retainer.

222
00:17:48,347 --> 00:17:49,371
But I like caramel.

223
00:17:49,448 --> 00:17:50,881
So does Tony.
Don't you, sport?

224
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,315
Oh, love 'em.

225
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:56,052
Okay, fellas, that's enough.

226
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:59,057
Charlie! You've been hiding
your light under a bushel.

227
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,320
Liv, you should feel that.

228
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:04,591
Hey! What weight do you
fight at, Charlie?

229
00:18:04,663 --> 00:18:06,221
- Fight?
- Boxing.

230
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:08,391
You do box, don't you?

231
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:11,095
I prefer other sports.

232
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,467
You don't do it at all?

233
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:13,505
No.

234
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:15,540
Liv, he doesn't do it at all.

235
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:17,098
Aw, Charlie.

236
00:18:17,176 --> 00:18:18,438
You're in trouble.

237
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:20,103
I don't understand.

238
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:22,704
Well, if you've got
your eye on Cordy...

239
00:18:22,782 --> 00:18:25,273
<i>? Remember Harry Applegate??</i>

240
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:28,252
<i>? Yeah, he took
Cordy on a date?</i>

241
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,948
<i>? Oh, what a dapper Dan?</i>

242
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:33,321
<i>? Pearly teeth and tennis tan?</i>

243
00:18:33,392 --> 00:18:34,416
Remember him well.

244
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:37,326
<i>? Thought he was a Romeo?</i>

245
00:18:37,396 --> 00:18:40,160
<i>? Tried to kiss our sis,
and, oh!?</i>

246
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:42,962
<i>? Harry ducked, but too late?</i>

247
00:18:43,035 --> 00:18:45,902
<i>? Father bought him
an upper plate?</i>

248
00:18:45,971 --> 00:18:48,769
<i>? Watch your footwork?</i>

249
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:51,639
<i>? Better learn
to bob and weave?</i>

250
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,544
<i>? Sister Cordy's
got dynamite up her sleeve?</i>

251
00:18:55,614 --> 00:18:56,808
<i>? What a jab?</i>

252
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:58,611
<i>? Dynamite up her sleeve?</i>

253
00:18:58,684 --> 00:18:59,742
<i>? What a hook?</i>

254
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:01,446
<i>? Dynamite up her sleeve?</i>

255
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,215
<i>? Keep your guard up?</i>

256
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:05,553
Charlie, never lead it
with your right.

257
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:07,148
You'll get killed that way.

258
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:09,421
Look, fellas,
let's forget the whole thing.

259
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:11,087
I didn't come here to do this.

260
00:19:11,163 --> 00:19:13,791
<i>? Archie Baxter
came here twice?</i>

261
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:16,528
<i>? First time out,
he acted nice?</i>

262
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:19,230
<i>? Romance was in the air?</i>

263
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:21,739
<i>? Oh, they made a lovely pair?</i>

264
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:22,739
Beautiful.

265
00:19:22,808 --> 00:19:25,174
<i>? Second date, it was a dance?</i>

266
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:28,577
<i>? He grabbed her tight,
this was his chance?</i>

267
00:19:28,647 --> 00:19:31,241
<i>? Cordy only bruised
that sport?</i>

268
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:33,478
<i>? Father settled it
out of court?</i>

269
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:34,348
So...

270
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,945
<i>? Watch your footwork?</i>

271
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:39,547
<i>? Better learn
to bob and weave?</i>

272
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:43,959
<i>? Sister Cordy's
got dynamite up her sleeve?</i>

273
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:45,291
<i>? What a fake?</i>

274
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:46,922
<i>? Dynamite up her sleeve?</i>

275
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:48,057
<i>? What an uppercut?</i>

276
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:53,070
<i>? Dynamite up her sleeve?</i>

277
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:03,342
Uh-oh.

278
00:20:03,415 --> 00:20:04,746
- Charlie.
- Charlie?

279
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:06,785
- Hey, Charlie, wake up.
- Are you hurt?

280
00:20:06,852 --> 00:20:08,683
Tony? Livingston?

281
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:11,188
Come on, it's time
for Bible class.

282
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:12,383
What happened?

283
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,517
He dropped his left.

284
00:20:14,593 --> 00:20:15,719
Oh.

285
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:21,256
You better get some ice.

286
00:20:25,504 --> 00:20:30,134
And get some beefsteak.

287
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:45,356
Charlie?

288
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,456
Charlie!

289
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,195
Well, don't you look pretty!

290
00:20:51,263 --> 00:20:52,560
Papa, how could you?

291
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:53,962
How could I what?

292
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:56,263
It's no wonder
I never have any callers.

293
00:20:56,335 --> 00:20:59,133
- Oh, now, wait a minute.
- People are afraid to come here.

294
00:20:59,204 --> 00:21:00,694
I didn't hurt the young sap.

295
00:21:00,773 --> 00:21:01,705
Sap?

296
00:21:01,774 --> 00:21:04,607
Charlie Taylor's only
the most popular boy in town.

297
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:07,740
Oh, here he comes.

298
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:09,747
Charlie, are you all right?

299
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:11,874
Sure, he's all right.
Come on, Charlie.

300
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:14,078
- Thataboy.
- I'm so sorry, Charlie.

301
00:21:14,153 --> 00:21:15,518
There's no serious damage.

302
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:17,385
He'll have a black eye
for a couple of days.

303
00:21:17,456 --> 00:21:19,185
- Ooh!
- Can I get you something?

304
00:21:19,258 --> 00:21:20,486
I sent for some raw meat.

305
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,254
How about a cold drink, Charlie?

306
00:21:22,328 --> 00:21:24,558
Oh!
Oh, thank you.

307
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,531
Charlie, why don't you sit
in this comfortable chair?

308
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,433
And I'll see if
I can get you some iced tea.

309
00:21:30,502 --> 00:21:33,130
Or would you like
a piece of chocolate cake?

310
00:21:33,205 --> 00:21:36,138
Charlie!

311
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,046
Gee, we're sorry.

312
00:21:41,113 --> 00:21:42,740
We didn't mean to do it.

313
00:21:42,815 --> 00:21:44,373
We told him
to keep his guard up.

314
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,010
You see, Cordy, I had
nothing to do with it.

315
00:21:48,754 --> 00:21:50,381
Didn't you?

316
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:52,219
Like father, like son.

317
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,521
You're all three the same.

318
00:21:54,593 --> 00:21:56,857
Always having your sport
no matter what.

319
00:21:56,929 --> 00:21:59,420
Always ready for a fight.

320
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:00,658
Oh, Cordy, we didn't...

321
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:03,531
Don't touch me.
I'll flatten you!

322
00:22:04,203 --> 00:22:05,500
Cordy.

323
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,907
Cordy, wait.

324
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:15,776
Blast it!

325
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:47,401
<i>? Oh,
Miss Cordelia Drexel Biddle?</i>

326
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:52,576
<i>? I thought I knew you well?</i>

327
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:57,384
<i>? But now,
Miss Cordelia Drexel Biddle?</i>

328
00:22:57,456 --> 00:23:05,124
<i>? I just can't tell?</i>

329
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:14,765
<i>? Are you valentine candy
or bo xing gloves??</i>

330
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:23,339
<i>? Lately you seem
very strange?</i>

331
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:30,321
<i>? What in the world's
coming over you??</i>

332
00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:37,886
<i>? Everything's starting
to change?</i>

333
00:23:37,963 --> 00:23:46,769
<i>? Are you sonnets by Shelley
or Rover Boys??</i>

334
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:55,611
<i>? Once any answer would do?</i>

335
00:23:55,681 --> 00:24:03,588
<i>? Why are you
suddenly wondering?</i>

336
00:24:03,655 --> 00:24:10,356
<i>? Which kind of someone
are you??</i>

337
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:19,133
<i>? Is a boy meant to spar with
or gaze at a star with??</i>

338
00:24:19,204 --> 00:24:26,804
<i>? Should you kiss him
or blacken his eye??</i>

339
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:31,441
<i>? Now, if he buys you roses?</i>

340
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:43,054
<i>? A right to the nose is really
not quite the proper reply?</i>

341
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:51,331
<i>? You're so lost
in the middle of in-between?</i>

342
00:24:51,403 --> 00:24:59,606
<i>? Is your destiny canvas
or crepe de Chine??</i>

343
00:24:59,678 --> 00:25:12,955
<i>? Will you someday be someone
that somebody loves??</i>

344
00:25:13,025 --> 00:25:22,491
<i>? Are you valentine candy
or...?</i>

345
00:25:24,803 --> 00:25:32,642
<i>? Bo xing gloves??</i>

346
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:38,279
Mrs. Worth,
I'm not a one to pry,

347
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,443
but I can't help wondering
some things.

348
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:42,282
Yes, Mr. Lawless?

349
00:25:42,354 --> 00:25:44,754
<i>? Board by board?</i>

350
00:25:44,823 --> 00:25:47,189
Is it forever like this?

351
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:48,886
Like what?

352
00:25:50,362 --> 00:25:53,695
Ha, that must be
Dr. Donleavy at last.

353
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:59,794
<i>? Body and mind of mortal man?</i>

354
00:26:00,372 --> 00:26:03,637
It isn't as if this was
the only job in Philadelphia.

355
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:07,642
Well, not for
a likable lad like meself.

356
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,845
<i>? Fashion the framework
board by board?</i>

357
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,217
Mrs. Worth?

358
00:26:16,288 --> 00:26:18,449
I've decided
to run along for now.

359
00:26:18,523 --> 00:26:21,253
Perhaps I can call another day.

360
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:23,719
Perhaps.

361
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:28,865
Who are you?

362
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:30,231
John Lawless.

363
00:26:30,302 --> 00:26:32,930
A professional pugilist,
no doubt.

364
00:26:33,005 --> 00:26:34,165
Ma'am?

365
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:35,604
Did you come here to fight?

366
00:26:35,674 --> 00:26:38,438
Oh, no, ma'am, I came
about the butler's position.

367
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,137
Then announce me.

368
00:26:40,212 --> 00:26:42,373
And take off your hat
in the house.

369
00:27:00,365 --> 00:27:04,893
<i>? Strengthen the dwelling
of the Lord?</i>

370
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:09,669
<i>? Fashion the framework
board by board?</i>

371
00:27:09,741 --> 00:27:14,144
<i>? Here in his image
now we stand?</i>

372
00:27:14,212 --> 00:27:18,308
<i>? Building his fortress
strong and grand?</i>

373
00:27:18,383 --> 00:27:20,248
<i>? It is written that the?</i>

374
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:24,585
<i>? Body and mind of mortal man?</i>

375
00:27:24,656 --> 00:27:28,649
<i>? Should walk in the spirit
of his master plan?</i>

376
00:27:28,727 --> 00:27:29,819
Mr. Biddle?

377
00:27:29,895 --> 00:27:31,726
There's a lady
in the music room.

378
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:32,729
A lady?

379
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:35,198
She didn't give a name.
Like there was no need.

380
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:37,735
Aunt Mary.
Tell her there's nobody at home.

381
00:27:37,803 --> 00:27:38,531
But, sir...

382
00:27:38,603 --> 00:27:40,127
<i>? It is written that the?</i>

383
00:27:40,205 --> 00:27:44,403
<i>? Body and mind of mortal man?</i>

384
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:48,572
<i>? Should walk in the spirit
of his master plan?</i>

385
00:27:48,647 --> 00:27:53,346
<i>? So we must strengthen
the dwelling of the Lord?</i>

386
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,681
I'm afraid
there's no one here, ma'am.

387
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:02,556
No one here?

388
00:28:04,997 --> 00:28:07,158
No one at all save
Mrs. Worth and meself.

389
00:28:07,232 --> 00:28:09,325
And as for me, I...

390
00:28:09,401 --> 00:28:15,465
<i>? It is written that the body
and mind of mortal man?</i>

391
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,634
<i>? Should walk in the spirit
of his master plan?</i>

392
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,541
Aunt Mary!

393
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,138
What a nice surprise.

394
00:28:23,215 --> 00:28:24,273
Is it?

395
00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:26,579
I come about
the butler's position.

396
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:28,881
Oh, good!
Then take these, would you?

397
00:28:28,954 --> 00:28:32,754
And tell Mr. Biddle
that Aunt Mary is here.

398
00:28:32,824 --> 00:28:36,419
And bring us some tea
into the parlor, please.

399
00:28:36,495 --> 00:28:38,520
If the stores get
any more crowded,

400
00:28:38,597 --> 00:28:41,225
I'm just going to have
to give up shopping entirely.

401
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:44,860
You can't imagine
the swarms of people.

402
00:28:44,936 --> 00:28:47,336
Do sit down, Aunt Mary.

403
00:28:47,406 --> 00:28:49,567
This is not a social call.

404
00:28:49,641 --> 00:28:52,269
I've come for a specific reason.

405
00:28:52,344 --> 00:28:56,144
In today's paper,
in George Gray's gossip column,

406
00:28:56,214 --> 00:28:58,148
it is reported...

407
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:03,349
that "last week,
Cordelia Drexel Biddle

408
00:29:03,422 --> 00:29:06,914
entered a one-step contest
in Atlantic City

409
00:29:06,992 --> 00:29:10,723
with a Heinie Fenstermaker,"
whoever that is.

410
00:29:10,796 --> 00:29:12,093
I don't recognize the name.

411
00:29:12,164 --> 00:29:14,564
"And won."

412
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:17,558
We, uh...

413
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:22,334
We were in Atlantic City
for the Bible-class convention.

414
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:24,272
I know why
you were in Atlantic City,

415
00:29:24,342 --> 00:29:27,140
but that does not explain
and certainly doesn't excuse

416
00:29:27,212 --> 00:29:28,338
the matter at hand.

417
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:31,610
Well, good afternoon, Aunt Mary.

418
00:29:33,985 --> 00:29:36,283
Always a pleasure to see you.

419
00:29:37,956 --> 00:29:39,048
Cordelia.

420
00:29:39,124 --> 00:29:40,523
Anthony.

421
00:29:40,592 --> 00:29:41,991
Oh, Anthony, your finger.

422
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,550
Yes.
George bit me.

423
00:29:43,628 --> 00:29:44,287
George?

424
00:29:44,362 --> 00:29:45,989
I can't imagine
what got into him.

425
00:29:46,064 --> 00:29:48,624
Quite obviously
your finger got into him.

426
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,759
Anyone who keeps
an alligator in the house

427
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:54,101
must expect to be bit
and deserves it.

428
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:58,305
Well, I'm sure George was only
playing and forgot himself.

429
00:29:58,376 --> 00:29:59,468
Do you really think so?

430
00:29:59,544 --> 00:30:01,011
Oh, I'm sure of it.

431
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,373
Over there, please.

432
00:30:04,449 --> 00:30:07,316
He probably feels
as badly about it as you do.

433
00:30:07,385 --> 00:30:08,909
I wonder.

434
00:30:19,197 --> 00:30:21,290
That will be all, thank you.

435
00:30:21,366 --> 00:30:22,628
You're right, Cordelia.

436
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:24,692
He wants to make up.

437
00:30:28,273 --> 00:30:29,365
- Well...
- Ha.

438
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:31,705
If the jungle theatrics
are quite over,

439
00:30:31,776 --> 00:30:34,904
I should like to return to
the subject of my visit,

440
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,311
which is Cordy.

441
00:30:36,381 --> 00:30:37,575
What about Cordy?

442
00:30:37,649 --> 00:30:40,117
I do not consider she's
under the right influences

443
00:30:40,185 --> 00:30:42,176
for a young woman
in her social position.

444
00:30:42,254 --> 00:30:45,280
She's under my influence and
her mother's and her brothers'.

445
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:47,587
Oh, please, Anthony,
don't pretend naiveté.

446
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:49,388
You know perfectly well
what I mean.

447
00:30:49,461 --> 00:30:50,621
No, I don't.

448
00:30:50,695 --> 00:30:52,356
I do not know what you mean.

449
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,022
Did you read
this morning's paper?

450
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:55,862
Yes.
Yes, I did.

451
00:30:55,934 --> 00:30:57,595
German U-boats in our waters

452
00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:00,194
sinking British merchant ships
in sight of Nantucket.

453
00:31:00,272 --> 00:31:02,001
That's what they think
of our neutrality.

454
00:31:02,073 --> 00:31:04,303
Did you get
beyond the first page?

455
00:31:04,376 --> 00:31:06,776
George Gray's column, dear.

456
00:31:06,845 --> 00:31:08,506
Cream or lemon, Aunt Mary?

457
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,411
Of course not.

458
00:31:14,452 --> 00:31:16,579
Blasted professional
troublemaker.

459
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:18,714
Oh, no, he doesn't make trouble.

460
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,724
He reports it.

461
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:22,820
This Mr. Fenstermaker.

462
00:31:22,894 --> 00:31:25,522
He's a member of one
of your Bible classes, I assume?

463
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:26,791
Yes.
Yes, he is.

464
00:31:26,865 --> 00:31:29,265
And a fine, upstanding
young man he is, too.

465
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:30,961
Anthony, tell me something.

466
00:31:31,036 --> 00:31:34,062
Were the children in school
at all last year?

467
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:36,972
They were being tutored,
Aunt Mary.

468
00:31:37,475 --> 00:31:39,340
And who's tutoring the tutor?

469
00:31:39,411 --> 00:31:40,378
What do you mean?

470
00:31:40,445 --> 00:31:41,673
Well, everybody knows

471
00:31:41,746 --> 00:31:43,907
that you hired this man
as a boxing coach.

472
00:31:43,982 --> 00:31:45,882
Can't even sign his own name.

473
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:48,078
Tony and Liv got
into St. Paul's all right.

474
00:31:48,153 --> 00:31:49,484
They're going next week.

475
00:31:49,554 --> 00:31:51,044
And I applaud the move.

476
00:31:51,122 --> 00:31:52,749
Now let's do the same for Cordy.

477
00:31:52,824 --> 00:31:55,190
The Laleta Wingfield School
for Young Ladies

478
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,320
in Lakewood, New Jersey,
is accepting applications.

479
00:31:58,396 --> 00:31:59,795
Oh, no, you don't.

480
00:31:59,864 --> 00:32:02,298
I won't have Cordy
exiled to some prison.

481
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:03,629
Anthony, answer me.

482
00:32:03,702 --> 00:32:06,000
What proper young man
in his right mind

483
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:08,164
would want to marry
a lady prizefighter?

484
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,571
Blast the proper young man.

485
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:10,801
That's easy to say.

486
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:13,036
Besides, what's this
talk about marriage?

487
00:32:13,111 --> 00:32:14,408
Cordy's a child.

488
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:16,947
You're blind, Anthony,
in more ways than one.

489
00:32:17,015 --> 00:32:18,812
- Blind or not, I'm not...
- Papa.

490
00:32:18,883 --> 00:32:20,407
Oh, Cordy.

491
00:32:20,485 --> 00:32:22,646
- We were just discussing you.
- Yes, I know.

492
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:26,282
And, Papa, I'd like
to go off to school.

493
00:32:26,358 --> 00:32:27,586
Hello, Aunt Mary.

494
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:28,990
Good afternoon, Cordelia.

495
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,084
Hello, Mama.

496
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:31,389
Darling.

497
00:32:31,463 --> 00:32:32,521
Cordy.

498
00:32:32,597 --> 00:32:34,326
Did I hear you correctly?

499
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,799
I'm sure you did, Papa.

500
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:39,929
Are you still upset
about what happened a while ago?

501
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:41,836
Do you want that boy
back over here?

502
00:32:41,906 --> 00:32:43,066
I'll drag him back.

503
00:32:43,141 --> 00:32:46,110
No, Papa.
It isn't Charlie Taylor.

504
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:47,405
Well, then, what is it?

505
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:48,810
Don't you like it here?

506
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,142
Of course I like it here.

507
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:51,739
Don't we have a good time?

508
00:32:51,816 --> 00:32:53,010
Yes.

509
00:32:53,652 --> 00:32:57,053
But it's hard to explain, Papa.

510
00:32:57,122 --> 00:32:59,283
I'm not like the other girls.

511
00:32:59,357 --> 00:33:00,619
Well, hooray for that.

512
00:33:00,692 --> 00:33:02,023
Look at the other girls.

513
00:33:02,093 --> 00:33:02,923
Oh, Papa.

514
00:33:02,994 --> 00:33:05,462
Cordy,
I like you the way you are.

515
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,462
You're pretty.

516
00:33:06,531 --> 00:33:08,123
You have fun.
You're alive.

517
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:10,599
You've got a better
left hook than Tony or Liv.

518
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:13,797
But I don't want a left hook.

519
00:33:13,872 --> 00:33:17,364
Anthony, I think we'd better
talk about this later.

520
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:19,535
She doesn't know
what she's saying.

521
00:33:19,611 --> 00:33:22,375
I do know what I'm saying.

522
00:33:22,714 --> 00:33:26,047
I want to go to
Miss Wingfield's school.

523
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:28,981
All right.

524
00:33:29,054 --> 00:33:30,817
All right.
You go.

525
00:33:31,356 --> 00:33:33,347
Go to prison if you want to.

526
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:42,195
Thank you, Papa.

527
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:49,306
Blast!

528
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:52,870
Ooh!

529
00:33:55,113 --> 00:33:57,547
Well, it's late.

530
00:33:57,615 --> 00:33:59,981
And I've other things to do.

531
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:02,713
Well, thank you
for coming, Aunt Mary.

532
00:34:03,154 --> 00:34:04,985
I don't like to interfere.

533
00:34:07,158 --> 00:34:10,855
But attention must be paid
to these matters.

534
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:12,862
I know.

535
00:34:12,931 --> 00:34:14,762
Good day, Cordelia.

536
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:17,498
Good day, Anthony.

537
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,018
Anthony.

538
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:43,083
We do have to let Cordy go.

539
00:34:43,561 --> 00:34:45,358
She's not a child anymore.

540
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:49,662
And it's selfish to keep her
here in this special world.

541
00:34:49,734 --> 00:34:51,702
What's wrong
with this special world?

542
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:55,206
Oh, Anthony, why do you have to
take everything so personally?

543
00:34:55,273 --> 00:34:57,138
Is there some other way?

544
00:34:58,276 --> 00:35:00,767
You might as well put out
that terrible weed.

545
00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:03,075
You won't get rid
of me that way.

546
00:35:14,192 --> 00:35:15,682
Anthony.

547
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,591
I raised very few objections

548
00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:19,721
to the way that Cordy's
been brought up,

549
00:35:19,798 --> 00:35:23,393
despite its being
rather unorthodox.

550
00:35:23,468 --> 00:35:25,936
Don't say, "What's wrong
with being unorthodox?"

551
00:35:26,004 --> 00:35:27,972
There's nothing wrong with it.

552
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:29,267
If I didn't feel that way,

553
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,332
I couldn't have stayed married
to you all these years.

554
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,109
It's been a good life.

555
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:37,273
A healthy life.
And Cordy's been happy.

556
00:35:37,348 --> 00:35:41,842
But now she's older
and feels a need to reach out.

557
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,785
But she won't like it.

558
00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:46,689
That's for her to decide.

559
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:50,655
You didn't want to let go
of Tony and Liv.

560
00:35:50,728 --> 00:35:53,788
You fought St. Paul's
like a tiger.

561
00:35:54,299 --> 00:35:56,995
Well, now it's Cordy.

562
00:35:57,068 --> 00:35:58,126
Blast it, Cordelia.

563
00:35:58,203 --> 00:36:00,569
I said she could go, didn't I?

564
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:02,033
Yes, dear.

565
00:36:02,106 --> 00:36:03,471
Well, then...

566
00:36:04,142 --> 00:36:06,076
what's all the fuss about?

567
00:36:10,348 --> 00:36:12,077
I'm going out to the gym.

568
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,117
Good idea.

569
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:15,448
You'll feel much better
when you get back.

570
00:36:19,491 --> 00:36:21,186
Oh.
Mrs. Biddle.

571
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:23,386
Mrs. Biddle,
if it's convenient...

572
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:26,191
Oh, yes. I'm afraid
I don't remember your name.

573
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:27,458
John Lawless, ma'am.

574
00:36:27,532 --> 00:36:29,056
The Mayflower Employment Agency.

575
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:32,125
Ah, fine.
Dinner's at 7:00, John.

576
00:36:34,305 --> 00:36:35,237
Well?

577
00:36:35,306 --> 00:36:36,500
Were you put on?

578
00:36:36,574 --> 00:36:38,804
"Dinner's at 7:00," she says.

579
00:36:38,877 --> 00:36:39,901
Heaven help me.

580
00:36:57,028 --> 00:36:59,189
Good way to let off steam.

581
00:36:59,764 --> 00:37:03,598
Papa, I'm sorry
for the way I acted.

582
00:37:03,668 --> 00:37:05,659
I appreciate your apology.

583
00:37:05,737 --> 00:37:06,761
I do love my home.

584
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:09,500
I don't really want to go away.

585
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:11,701
Well, you were right
wanting to go.

586
00:37:11,776 --> 00:37:13,744
You're not a child any longer.

587
00:37:13,811 --> 00:37:17,474
It's selfish to try to keep you
here in this special world.

588
00:37:18,283 --> 00:37:20,274
What's wrong
with this special world?

589
00:37:20,351 --> 00:37:22,649
Now, don't you start that.

590
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:27,019
Cordy.

591
00:37:29,994 --> 00:37:32,895
You have to make your own life
in your own way.

592
00:37:32,964 --> 00:37:35,956
You can't stay here
with your mother and me forever.

593
00:37:37,936 --> 00:37:39,801
Of course, when you
come home on vacations,

594
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:42,032
things will be just the same.

595
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:49,202
All of a sudden, I'm afraid.

596
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:52,042
Now, that I won't have.

597
00:37:52,116 --> 00:37:54,380
There's nothing out there
to be afraid of,

598
00:37:54,452 --> 00:37:56,818
as long as you keep your
guard up and your chin tucked,

599
00:37:56,888 --> 00:38:00,016
and know how to bring one up
from the floor.

600
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:03,218
Oh, Papa.

601
00:38:04,495 --> 00:38:06,690
When I was a little girl,

602
00:38:06,764 --> 00:38:09,392
I used to think you must be
the most wonderful person

603
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:11,298
in the whole world.

604
00:38:13,204 --> 00:38:18,972
Now that I'm older
and much wiser, I know you are.

605
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,547
Well, come on,
let's go back in the house.

606
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,856
If you don't like that school,
you don't have to stay up there.

607
00:38:33,591 --> 00:38:35,752
<i>? Dee-a da da da?</i>

608
00:38:35,893 --> 00:38:37,827
<i>? Dee-a ta ta ta-ta ta?</i>

609
00:38:37,895 --> 00:38:38,987
<i>? Da-da ta-ta tee?</i>

610
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:49,038
Mr. Biddle?

611
00:38:59,017 --> 00:39:00,450
Mr. Bid...

612
00:39:27,278 --> 00:39:29,007
What's wrong?
You're white as a sheet.

613
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,945
Faith, you do have an alligator!

614
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:32,676
12 of them.
What's wrong with that?

615
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,342
Not a thing.
It's relieved, I am.

616
00:39:34,419 --> 00:39:36,819
I captured them myself
down in Florida.

617
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:39,823
Went into the swamp
with a party of Seminoles.

618
00:39:39,891 --> 00:39:42,553
Have you ever seen a Seminole
Indian capture alligators?

619
00:39:42,627 --> 00:39:43,753
I can't say I have.

620
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:48,128
Well, they can paddle a canoe so
you can't hear it two feet away.

621
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:49,757
If the animals
don't show themselves,

622
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:51,529
you give them the mating call.

623
00:40:01,312 --> 00:40:02,677
Say, who are you, anyway?

624
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:04,738
John Lawless, sir.
I'll be the new butler.

625
00:40:04,816 --> 00:40:06,408
Oh, we've got a new butler.

626
00:40:06,484 --> 00:40:07,917
No, Papa.
He quit.

627
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:09,179
Already?

628
00:40:09,253 --> 00:40:10,584
- Days ago.
- Oh.

629
00:40:10,655 --> 00:40:12,418
Well, if you'll excuse me, sir.

630
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,321
John Lawless, is it?

631
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:15,916
That's right, sir.

632
00:40:15,993 --> 00:40:17,392
Tell me, John.

633
00:40:17,462 --> 00:40:18,986
Are you a religious man?

634
00:40:19,063 --> 00:40:20,553
I try to live by the Good Book.

635
00:40:20,631 --> 00:40:22,462
How well do you succeed?

636
00:40:22,533 --> 00:40:24,228
- I'm not sure.
- Never mind.

637
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:26,702
We'll go into that another time.

638
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:28,466
What do you think of boxing?

639
00:40:28,806 --> 00:40:31,001
- Boxing?
- Why don't we find Mother...

640
00:40:31,075 --> 00:40:33,475
Not in self-defense.
Ever done any of that?

641
00:40:33,544 --> 00:40:35,671
Well, at the fair last year
in County Tyrone,

642
00:40:35,747 --> 00:40:38,682
I was fisticuffs champion.

643
00:40:39,217 --> 00:40:40,707
Is that so?

644
00:40:40,785 --> 00:40:41,717
Champion?

645
00:40:41,786 --> 00:40:43,811
Well, it isn't
a very large county, sir.

646
00:40:43,888 --> 00:40:47,016
Fisticuffs champion
of where was that again?

647
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:49,321
County Tyrone.
It's in Ireland.

648
00:40:49,393 --> 00:40:52,226
Ah. You going to become
an American citizen, John?

649
00:40:52,296 --> 00:40:54,958
- Well, I intend to apply, sir.
- You'll never regret it.

650
00:40:55,032 --> 00:40:56,829
- Greatest country in the world.
- Papa!

651
00:40:56,901 --> 00:40:59,597
There's certain things
I believe in, John.

652
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:02,537
God and the United States
are at the top of the list.

653
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:05,474
I know very well what
the United States has to offer.

654
00:41:05,543 --> 00:41:06,771
That's how it is I'm here.

655
00:41:06,844 --> 00:41:08,141
Yes, well, like I say...

656
00:41:08,212 --> 00:41:10,009
There's something else
I know just as well.

657
00:41:10,081 --> 00:41:13,016
And that is you are what you
are, and that's good, too.

658
00:41:13,084 --> 00:41:15,143
I beg your pardon?

659
00:41:15,219 --> 00:41:17,278
Well, being an American
is addin' something.

660
00:41:17,355 --> 00:41:19,255
It isn't subtracting.

661
00:41:21,392 --> 00:41:23,121
On the night
before I sailed away,

662
00:41:23,194 --> 00:41:25,526
they come from far and near.

663
00:41:25,596 --> 00:41:27,655
<i>? All me friends
and all me kin?</i>

664
00:41:27,732 --> 00:41:30,997
<i>? To shed a partin' tear?</i>

665
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:33,832
<i>? We knew we'd
never meet again?</i>

666
00:41:33,905 --> 00:41:38,137
<i>? And yet was clear to see?</i>

667
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:41,975
<i>? I'd always be
a part of them?</i>

668
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:48,884
<i>? And them a part of me?</i>

669
00:41:49,854 --> 00:41:52,220
<i>? I'll always be Irish?</i>

670
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,155
<i>? 'Cause that's how I began?</i>

671
00:41:54,225 --> 00:41:57,353
<i>? I'll always be Irish,
I'll say that to any man?</i>

672
00:41:57,428 --> 00:42:01,194
<i>? And when I'm an American,
I'll be a good one, too?</i>

673
00:42:01,265 --> 00:42:04,632
<i>? I'll be truly as American
as Irish stew?</i>

674
00:42:04,702 --> 00:42:06,431
Hey, that's pretty good.

675
00:42:06,504 --> 00:42:10,133
<i>? He'll be truly as American
as Irish stew?</i>

676
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:12,574
Ask for Irish stew in Ireland
and see what you get.

677
00:42:12,643 --> 00:42:13,871
I never thought of that.

678
00:42:13,945 --> 00:42:17,403
In Ireland,
all the stew is Irish.

679
00:42:18,015 --> 00:42:19,744
<i>? I'll always be Irish?</i>

680
00:42:19,817 --> 00:42:21,546
<i>? A fact I'll not deny?</i>

681
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:25,248
<i>? I'll always be Irish,
and I'll hold me head up high?</i>

682
00:42:25,323 --> 00:42:27,223
<i>? I'll wear the green
St. Patty's Day?</i>

683
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:28,758
<i>? And yet for all of that?</i>

684
00:42:28,826 --> 00:42:31,920
<i>? I'll be truly as American
as "Casey at the Bat"?</i>

685
00:42:31,996 --> 00:42:36,899
<i>? He'll be truly as American
as "Casey at the Bat"?</i>

686
00:42:37,668 --> 00:42:40,034
Say, that looks like
good exercise.

687
00:42:42,773 --> 00:42:43,705
Come on, Cordy.

688
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:45,571
- Hey!
- Papa!

689
00:42:45,643 --> 00:42:46,940
If you can win
a one-step contest,

690
00:42:47,011 --> 00:42:48,239
you ought to be able to do this.

691
00:42:48,312 --> 00:42:49,643
I thought you
didn't like dancing.

692
00:42:49,714 --> 00:42:51,511
It's that waltzing business
I don't like.

693
00:42:51,582 --> 00:42:54,016
Ha.
That's for old folks.

694
00:42:58,089 --> 00:42:59,147
Hey!

695
00:43:01,158 --> 00:43:02,716
Huh! Ha!

696
00:43:09,267 --> 00:43:11,326
<i>? If I went to Paris
for the rest of me days?</i>

697
00:43:11,402 --> 00:43:13,302
<i>? And ate bread and cheese
in sidewalk cafés?</i>

698
00:43:13,371 --> 00:43:14,895
<i>? Lived in a garret,
wore a beret?</i>

699
00:43:14,972 --> 00:43:17,805
<i>-? What would I be??
- An Irishman!</i>

700
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:24,080
<i>? If I went to Tibet
and bought me a yak?</i>

701
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:25,843
<i>? And traveled Siberia
ridin' his back?</i>

702
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:27,748
<i>? The peasants would point
at me, what would they say??</i>

703
00:43:27,818 --> 00:43:31,379
Irishman?

704
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,218
- Right!
- Right!

705
00:43:34,492 --> 00:43:39,828
<i>? But if I went to Spain
and grew a moustache?</i>

706
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:44,766
<i>? Strummed the guitar
and wore me a sash?</i>

707
00:43:44,835 --> 00:43:50,569
<i>? Became a toreador
and fought me a bull?</i>

708
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:51,903
<i>- ndele!</i>

709
00:43:51,976 --> 00:43:53,739
<i>- Ndele!</i>

710
00:44:11,529 --> 00:44:13,326
- Hooray!
- Yippee!

711
00:44:13,931 --> 00:44:15,956
After they awarded me
both ears and the tail,

712
00:44:16,033 --> 00:44:16,965
what would they say?

713
00:44:17,034 --> 00:44:17,966
<i>- Olé!
- Olé!</i>

714
00:44:18,035 --> 00:44:20,333
- For the Irishman!
- Right!

715
00:44:20,404 --> 00:44:22,235
Hey-ho!

716
00:44:22,306 --> 00:44:24,934
Whoo-aaa-hoo!

717
00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:30,042
Come on, Mrs. Worth.

718
00:44:30,114 --> 00:44:31,081
Come on, now.

719
00:44:31,148 --> 00:44:32,342
Whoo! Ha!

720
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:34,111
It's good for you.

721
00:44:37,154 --> 00:44:38,519
Ha ha!

722
00:44:39,256 --> 00:44:41,884
Ah, thatagirl!

723
00:44:45,763 --> 00:44:48,129
You should have seen
me father doin' this.

724
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:51,396
Like a tornado across the floor.

725
00:44:51,469 --> 00:44:52,458
Hey!

726
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:55,637
Oh!

727
00:44:55,706 --> 00:44:57,105
Ohhhh!

728
00:44:57,174 --> 00:44:59,108
Ohh! Oh!

729
00:44:59,176 --> 00:45:00,700
<i>? He'll always be Irish?</i>

730
00:45:00,778 --> 00:45:02,405
Ah, shout it good and loud!

731
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,539
<i>? He'll always be Irish?</i>

732
00:45:04,615 --> 00:45:07,175
<i>? Of his heritage, he's proud?</i>

733
00:45:07,251 --> 00:45:11,449
<i>? I'm proud of Irish blarney?</i>

734
00:45:11,522 --> 00:45:17,085
<i>? And Irish sentiment?</i>

735
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:20,756
<i>? And I'll bet someday
we get an Irish president?</i>

736
00:45:20,831 --> 00:45:25,461
<i>? And I'll bet someday
we get an Irish president?</i>

737
00:45:25,936 --> 00:45:28,029
Whee-ha!

738
00:45:30,908 --> 00:45:32,876
Hey, let me in there.

739
00:45:34,412 --> 00:45:36,141
Hey-ya diddle!

740
00:45:37,415 --> 00:45:38,347
Hey-ya!

741
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:39,781
Ha!

742
00:45:44,488 --> 00:45:45,512
Beautiful!

743
00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:47,056
Whee!

744
00:45:57,368 --> 00:45:58,960
Whee! Hoo!

745
00:45:59,637 --> 00:46:01,229
- Ha!
- Whoo!

746
00:46:01,672 --> 00:46:02,934
Hey!

747
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,235
Whoo!

748
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:06,536
Whoo-hoo!

749
00:46:14,518 --> 00:46:15,314
Whoo!

750
00:46:15,386 --> 00:46:19,083
Oh, the Mayflower
Employment Agency.

751
00:46:19,623 --> 00:46:22,057
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.

752
00:46:25,196 --> 00:46:26,493
Hey!

753
00:46:26,564 --> 00:46:27,792
Yes.

754
00:46:27,865 --> 00:46:31,562
I think Mr. Lawless
will suit our needs very well.

755
00:46:34,905 --> 00:46:35,837
Hee!

756
00:46:35,906 --> 00:46:38,204
Come on,
I want George to see this.

757
00:46:38,876 --> 00:46:42,073
Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo!

758
00:47:02,867 --> 00:47:06,098
Cordelia, whatever
are you laughing at?

759
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,660
Papa.

760
00:47:07,738 --> 00:47:11,139
He's now giving military
training to the Bible classes.

761
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:13,540
They're marching up and down
in front of the house.

762
00:47:13,611 --> 00:47:15,602
Broomsticks for rifles.

763
00:47:24,255 --> 00:47:27,850
Cordelia, what an absolutely
gorgeous invitation!

764
00:47:27,925 --> 00:47:29,756
Whoever is it from?

765
00:47:29,827 --> 00:47:32,261
Well, read it for yourself
if you're so anxious.

766
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:34,763
I'm not the least bit anxious.

767
00:47:34,832 --> 00:47:37,596
I was only trying
to be sociable.

768
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,741
Cordelia!

769
00:47:51,815 --> 00:47:55,876
The William Thaws are absolutely
world-famous for their parties.

770
00:47:55,953 --> 00:47:58,717
However did you
get this invitation?

771
00:47:58,789 --> 00:48:01,257
Well, I'm in great demand
socially.

772
00:48:01,325 --> 00:48:02,553
Didn't you know?

773
00:48:02,626 --> 00:48:06,027
I suppose you give
boxing exhibitions.

774
00:48:06,096 --> 00:48:08,223
However did you guess?

775
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:11,826
And I think I'll get in
some practice.

776
00:48:11,902 --> 00:48:13,062
Right now!

777
00:48:13,137 --> 00:48:15,298
I'll call Miss Wingfield!

778
00:48:15,372 --> 00:48:18,170
With that rouge
all over your face?

779
00:48:19,009 --> 00:48:20,601
Cordy.

780
00:48:22,012 --> 00:48:23,570
You wouldn't tell Miss Wingfield

781
00:48:23,647 --> 00:48:26,411
that I wear rouge
to bed, will you?

782
00:48:26,483 --> 00:48:28,849
No matter how angry you get?

783
00:48:28,919 --> 00:48:29,977
Well...

784
00:48:30,054 --> 00:48:33,421
Oh, no, you wouldn't be
so cruel.

785
00:48:37,561 --> 00:48:39,028
Rosemary?

786
00:48:39,096 --> 00:48:39,926
Hmm?

787
00:48:42,132 --> 00:48:44,532
Would you teach me how to flirt?

788
00:48:44,868 --> 00:48:46,665
Pardon?

789
00:48:46,737 --> 00:48:49,001
Well, my Aunt Gladys said
there were gonna be

790
00:48:49,073 --> 00:48:51,007
all sorts of young men
at the dance

791
00:48:51,075 --> 00:48:53,236
from Yale and Princeton.

792
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:54,641
Your Aunt Gladys.

793
00:48:54,712 --> 00:48:56,703
So that's how you got invited.

794
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,907
The William Thaws
are my aunt and uncle.

795
00:48:58,983 --> 00:49:00,780
Since I'm going to school
here in Lakewood,

796
00:49:00,851 --> 00:49:02,546
they're practically duty-bound.

797
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,144
I should have guessed.

798
00:49:04,221 --> 00:49:07,349
Well, it helps to be related
to almost everybody.

799
00:49:08,792 --> 00:49:11,260
I want to make the most of it.

800
00:49:11,629 --> 00:49:13,688
Will you help me, Rosemary?

801
00:49:13,764 --> 00:49:17,530
Cordelia, if you're suggesting
that I know anything about...

802
00:49:17,601 --> 00:49:19,091
Oh, come on, Rosemary.

803
00:49:19,169 --> 00:49:21,729
I'll bet you're
the world's champion.

804
00:49:23,073 --> 00:49:26,065
Well, the fact that
I have been admired by men

805
00:49:26,143 --> 00:49:28,668
doesn't make me a flirt.

806
00:49:31,515 --> 00:49:33,005
Rosemary.

807
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:34,015
Hmm?

808
00:49:34,752 --> 00:49:37,277
Would you like me to swear

809
00:49:37,354 --> 00:49:41,814
that I'll never tell
Miss Wingfield about the rouge?

810
00:49:43,327 --> 00:49:44,419
That's blackmail.

811
00:49:44,495 --> 00:49:46,429
It's a trade.

812
00:49:47,097 --> 00:49:48,462
Well?

813
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:51,667
I wonder if those Thaw parties

814
00:49:51,735 --> 00:49:56,138
are as absolutely
spectacular as people say.

815
00:49:57,207 --> 00:49:59,471
That's how trading works,
isn't it?

816
00:49:59,543 --> 00:50:01,101
All right.

817
00:50:01,945 --> 00:50:03,435
I'll ask my Aunt Gladys.

818
00:50:03,514 --> 00:50:05,175
Oh, good!

819
00:50:05,249 --> 00:50:06,716
Come here.

820
00:50:07,685 --> 00:50:11,621
Now, if a girl wants
to be popular nowadays,

821
00:50:11,689 --> 00:50:15,318
there's one thing that she
absolutely needs to know.

822
00:50:15,392 --> 00:50:16,620
What?

823
00:50:17,995 --> 00:50:20,327
Bye-yum pum pum.

824
00:50:20,898 --> 00:50:22,923
Bye-yum pum pum?

825
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,264
<i>? Bye-yum pum pum?</i>

826
00:50:25,336 --> 00:50:27,600
<i>? Bye-yum pum pum?</i>

827
00:50:27,671 --> 00:50:31,232
<i>? Bye-yum pum pum, bye-yum?</i>

828
00:50:31,308 --> 00:50:34,277
<i>? You must be?</i>

829
00:50:34,345 --> 00:50:38,611
<i>? Oh, so misterioso?</i>

830
00:50:38,682 --> 00:50:43,312
<i>? Enthusiasm is très passé?</i>

831
00:50:43,387 --> 00:50:46,254
<i>? You must slink
across the floor?</i>

832
00:50:46,323 --> 00:50:49,292
<i>? As if it's a dreadful bore?</i>

833
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:53,262
<i>? To the rhythm
of bye-yum pum pum?</i>

834
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:55,389
<i>? Bye-yum pum pum?</i>

835
00:50:55,466 --> 00:50:59,402
<i>? Bye-yum pum pum, bye-yum?</i>

836
00:51:00,137 --> 00:51:02,935
<i>? Nita Naldi, Theda Bara?</i>

837
00:51:03,006 --> 00:51:04,997
<i>? Hollow cheeks
and black mascara?</i>

838
00:51:05,075 --> 00:51:08,238
<i>? Bye-yum pum pum, bye-yum?</i>

839
00:51:08,312 --> 00:51:09,176
Okay, what's next?

840
00:51:09,246 --> 00:51:11,373
<i>? The men in college?</i>

841
00:51:11,448 --> 00:51:13,416
<i>? Always acknowledge?</i>

842
00:51:13,484 --> 00:51:18,547
<i>? A girl who dances
in a trance?</i>

843
00:51:18,622 --> 00:51:24,288
<i>? So bye-yum until the dawn
as if you're about to yawn?</i>

844
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:25,851
<i>? To the rhythm of?</i>

845
00:51:25,929 --> 00:51:28,227
<i>? Bye-yum pum pum?</i>

846
00:51:28,298 --> 00:51:29,788
<i>? Bye-yum pum pum?</i>

847
00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:30,731
Attitude, Cordy!

848
00:51:30,801 --> 00:51:34,669
<i>? Bye-yum pum pum, bye-yum?</i>

849
00:51:35,038 --> 00:51:39,839
<i>? Today the key
to being wanted?</i>

850
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:44,438
<i>? Is just to glide
as if you're hunted?</i>

851
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:56,726
<i>? And your right foot,
left foot, right, back?</i>

852
00:51:56,794 --> 00:51:57,954
Let me try, let me try!

853
00:51:58,028 --> 00:52:01,555
Right foot, left foot,
right, back together.

854
00:52:01,632 --> 00:52:03,998
Now arms, Cordy, arms.

855
00:52:04,067 --> 00:52:06,160
Use your arms, back together.

856
00:52:06,236 --> 00:52:08,227
And slink, two, three.

857
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:10,330
Bye-yum and slink, two, three.

858
00:52:10,407 --> 00:52:11,931
Bye-yum and slink, two.

859
00:52:12,009 --> 00:52:14,102
Now spin like a top.

860
00:52:16,246 --> 00:52:18,237
That's it!

861
00:52:23,954 --> 00:52:25,785
Cordy, you're absolutely wicked.

862
00:52:25,856 --> 00:52:27,687
I love it.

863
00:52:29,326 --> 00:52:31,351
How exotic.

864
00:52:37,267 --> 00:52:39,167
Bravo.

865
00:52:50,447 --> 00:52:52,108
Nita Naldi!

866
00:52:52,182 --> 00:52:54,343
Theda Bara!

867
00:52:57,754 --> 00:52:59,551
Cordy,
you're absolutely dangerous.

868
00:52:59,623 --> 00:53:01,090
And scandalous!

869
00:53:01,158 --> 00:53:05,492
<i>? For when you're
oh, so misterioso?</i>

870
00:53:05,562 --> 00:53:09,293
<i>? The men will grow
so entranced with you?</i>

871
00:53:09,366 --> 00:53:10,298
Shocking!

872
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:15,361
<i>? As you secretly conceal
the tingly way you feel?</i>

873
00:53:15,439 --> 00:53:16,963
<i>? When you're dancing to?</i>

874
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,871
<i>? Bye-yum pum pum?</i>

875
00:53:18,942 --> 00:53:21,137
<i>? Bye-yum pum pum?</i>

876
00:53:21,211 --> 00:53:25,011
<i>? Bye-yum pum pum, bye-yum?</i>

877
00:55:20,163 --> 00:55:21,630
Cordelia!

878
00:55:21,698 --> 00:55:24,189
Oh!
Aunt Gladys.

879
00:55:24,267 --> 00:55:26,497
Cordelia, darling.

880
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:27,798
Aunt Gladys.

881
00:55:27,871 --> 00:55:29,395
I've been looking
all over for you.

882
00:55:29,473 --> 00:55:31,498
Where have you been?

883
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:36,546
I want you to meet the two most
charming young men at the party.

884
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:38,638
My niece,
Cordelia Drexel Biddle.

885
00:55:38,715 --> 00:55:41,707
Mr. Roger Fitzsimmons
and Mr. Walter Blakely.

886
00:55:41,785 --> 00:55:44,345
Both just down from New Haven.

887
00:55:44,921 --> 00:55:47,048
- How do you do?
- A pleasure.

888
00:55:47,124 --> 00:55:50,582
Well, I'll leave you three
to get acquainted.

889
00:55:50,661 --> 00:55:52,822
Young people today
don't need anything more

890
00:55:52,896 --> 00:55:54,921
than an introduction.

891
00:55:59,002 --> 00:56:00,799
Snappy party.

892
00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:02,031
What?

893
00:56:02,105 --> 00:56:04,164
Oh.
Oh, yes.

894
00:56:04,241 --> 00:56:06,209
Very snappy.

895
00:56:06,276 --> 00:56:07,743
Have a gasper?

896
00:56:07,811 --> 00:56:09,005
A what?

897
00:56:12,049 --> 00:56:12,981
Oh.

898
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:14,745
No, thank you.

899
00:56:14,818 --> 00:56:16,217
I didn't think
you were the type.

900
00:56:16,286 --> 00:56:18,151
These days, you can't tell.

901
00:56:18,221 --> 00:56:20,815
Smoking shortens your wind.

902
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:24,659
Well, that's why athletes
never smoke.

903
00:56:27,964 --> 00:56:29,556
Say, there's a friend
of my family

904
00:56:29,633 --> 00:56:31,191
I ought to go over and speak to.

905
00:56:31,268 --> 00:56:33,065
Can't it wait
until later, Roger?

906
00:56:33,136 --> 00:56:34,296
I wouldn't want to miss her.

907
00:56:34,371 --> 00:56:36,771
My mother
would never forgive me.

908
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,273
Miss Biddle.

909
00:56:52,723 --> 00:56:55,214
Yoo-hoo.
Cordelia.

910
00:56:55,959 --> 00:56:59,087
Absolutely heavenly party.

911
00:56:59,162 --> 00:57:01,630
Yes. Heavenly.

912
00:57:02,232 --> 00:57:05,497
So many attractive men.

913
00:57:07,037 --> 00:57:09,597
Who is that?

914
00:57:09,673 --> 00:57:11,436
My roommate.

915
00:57:18,315 --> 00:57:20,909
We're playing Harvard next week.

916
00:57:22,085 --> 00:57:23,450
Who is?

917
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,919
Yale.

918
00:57:25,422 --> 00:57:26,354
Oh.

919
00:57:31,328 --> 00:57:33,091
Mr. Blakely.

920
00:57:33,163 --> 00:57:34,653
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

921
00:57:34,731 --> 00:57:36,596
I promised this dance.

922
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:37,598
You did?

923
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:38,634
Yes.

924
00:57:38,702 --> 00:57:39,634
The first one-step.

925
00:57:39,703 --> 00:57:40,931
I hope you don't mind.

926
00:57:41,004 --> 00:57:43,097
Oh, no.
No, of course not.

927
00:57:43,173 --> 00:57:46,074
Why don't you ask Rosemary?

928
00:57:46,443 --> 00:57:49,469
- Oh, no, I couldn't.
- Tell her I suggested it.

929
00:57:49,546 --> 00:57:51,878
Well, when your partner comes.

930
00:57:52,582 --> 00:57:54,982
Oh, but you needn't wait around.

931
00:57:55,051 --> 00:57:56,541
He'll be here any second.

932
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,552
Who is he?

933
00:57:57,621 --> 00:57:59,646
I can keep an eye out for him.

934
00:57:59,723 --> 00:58:01,918
Oh, I don't think you know him.

935
00:58:01,992 --> 00:58:03,687
What's his name?

936
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,591
His name?

937
00:58:05,662 --> 00:58:06,629
Well, it's...

938
00:58:06,696 --> 00:58:08,527
Angier Duke.

939
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:10,364
This is our dance, isn't it?

940
00:58:10,433 --> 00:58:12,230
The first one-step?

941
00:58:12,769 --> 00:58:13,861
Yes.

942
00:58:13,937 --> 00:58:16,337
Mr. Duke, Mr. Blakely.

943
00:58:16,406 --> 00:58:18,772
You can't keep her to yourself
all evening, Mr. Blakely.

944
00:58:18,842 --> 00:58:21,504
No, I guess not.

945
00:58:22,879 --> 00:58:24,278
Miss Biddle.

946
00:58:25,949 --> 00:58:28,918
He's probably a nice enough
fellow when you get to know him.

947
00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:30,816
Shall we have our dance?

948
00:58:33,323 --> 00:58:34,950
Mr. Duke, why did you do that?

949
00:58:35,025 --> 00:58:36,890
Because I thought
I'd like to know you.

950
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,860
Worked out real well, didn't it?

951
00:58:58,181 --> 00:59:00,649
Why do you want to know me?

952
00:59:00,717 --> 00:59:03,481
Because you're not like
the other girls.

953
00:59:03,887 --> 00:59:06,253
I mean that in the nicest way.

954
00:59:06,756 --> 00:59:08,553
I don't like these pushy girls

955
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:11,958
who think they can trap
any man with a big act.

956
00:59:12,362 --> 00:59:13,852
But you saw me practicing.

957
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:16,091
Didn't it scare you away?

958
00:59:16,499 --> 00:59:17,761
No.

959
00:59:17,834 --> 00:59:19,995
You were so bad at it.

960
00:59:20,436 --> 00:59:21,562
Oh.

961
00:59:23,673 --> 00:59:25,732
It's a waltz.

962
00:59:25,808 --> 00:59:28,174
The waltz is for old people.

963
00:59:28,244 --> 00:59:29,643
Is it?

964
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:46,188
I warned you.
I'm not a very good dancer.

965
00:59:46,262 --> 00:59:48,059
Oh, nonsense, Mr. Blakely.

966
00:59:48,131 --> 00:59:50,463
You're as light as an elf.

967
01:00:15,325 --> 01:00:17,816
I don't think the waltz
is for old people.

968
01:00:17,894 --> 01:00:20,920
I was just saying something
somebody told me.

969
01:00:25,602 --> 01:00:29,868
<i>? Are we dancing??</i>

970
01:00:29,939 --> 01:00:34,899
<i>? Are we really here??</i>

971
01:00:34,978 --> 01:00:39,881
<i>? Is this feeling
something real?</i>

972
01:00:39,949 --> 01:00:44,386
<i>? Or will it disappear??</i>

973
01:00:45,388 --> 01:00:49,757
<i>? Are we dancing??</i>

974
01:00:49,826 --> 01:00:54,627
<i>? Does the music soar??</i>

975
01:00:54,697 --> 01:00:59,532
<i>? Was this lovely song I hear?</i>

976
01:00:59,602 --> 01:01:04,835
<i>? Ever heard before??</i>

977
01:01:04,907 --> 01:01:09,503
<i>? Are your eyes
confessing things?</i>

978
01:01:09,579 --> 01:01:13,743
<i>? I alone can see?</i>

979
01:01:13,816 --> 01:01:18,412
<i>? Or is my imagination?</i>

980
01:01:18,488 --> 01:01:23,118
<i>? Flying away with me??</i>

981
01:01:25,028 --> 01:01:29,192
<i>? Are we dancing??</i>

982
01:01:29,265 --> 01:01:34,134
<i>? Say we really are?</i>

983
01:01:34,203 --> 01:01:39,334
<i>? Then I'll know that I?</i>

984
01:01:39,409 --> 01:01:43,812
<i>? Reached into the sky?</i>

985
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:47,941
<i>? I reached into the sky?</i>

986
01:01:48,017 --> 01:01:55,480
<i>? And touched a star?</i>

987
01:02:02,265 --> 01:02:07,202
<i>? Is this feeling
something real?</i>

988
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:13,266
<i>? Or will it disappear??</i>

989
01:02:22,585 --> 01:02:27,648
<i>? Was this lovely song I hear?</i>

990
01:02:27,724 --> 01:02:32,161
<i>? Ever heard before??</i>

991
01:02:32,228 --> 01:02:37,291
<i>? Are your eyes
confessing things?</i>

992
01:02:37,366 --> 01:02:41,393
<i>? I alone can see?</i>

993
01:02:41,471 --> 01:02:45,840
<i>? Or is my imagination?</i>

994
01:02:45,908 --> 01:02:52,404
<i>? Flying away with me??</i>

995
01:02:52,482 --> 01:02:57,249
<i>? Are we dancing??</i>

996
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:04,385
<i>? Say we really are?</i>

997
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:08,362
<i>? Then I'll know that I?</i>

998
01:03:08,431 --> 01:03:10,865
<i>? I'll know that I?</i>

999
01:03:10,933 --> 01:03:13,766
<i>? Reached into the sky?</i>

1000
01:03:13,836 --> 01:03:16,066
<i>? Reached to the sky?</i>

1001
01:03:16,139 --> 01:03:20,576
<i>? I reached into the sky?</i>

1002
01:03:20,643 --> 01:03:30,575
<i>? And touched a star?</i>

1003
01:03:51,174 --> 01:03:53,301
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1004
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:55,072
It's more than beautiful.

1005
01:03:55,144 --> 01:03:59,046
It's a masterpiece
of engineering.

1006
01:04:02,285 --> 01:04:04,776
A Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost.

1007
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:09,189
Oh.

1008
01:04:10,092 --> 01:04:12,219
Yes, it's very nice.

1009
01:04:12,295 --> 01:04:16,129
You know, the chassis
of that car is bolted together

1010
01:04:16,199 --> 01:04:18,064
with special tapered bolts

1011
01:04:18,134 --> 01:04:20,762
made to fit holes
that were reamed by hand.

1012
01:04:20,837 --> 01:04:22,566
- Really?
- Yeah.

1013
01:04:22,638 --> 01:04:25,368
It's practically sewn together.

1014
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:30,377
Well, I don't know
very much about cars.

1015
01:04:30,446 --> 01:04:33,279
You don't have to know much
to appreciate a Rolls.

1016
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:36,716
If you were just once
out on the road in that car.

1017
01:04:37,153 --> 01:04:39,280
Say, it's cold out here,
isn't it?

1018
01:04:43,492 --> 01:04:45,289
Can I get your coat?

1019
01:04:52,134 --> 01:04:54,659
My Uncle has a Silver Ghost.

1020
01:04:55,972 --> 01:04:57,530
I've driven it.

1021
01:04:59,976 --> 01:05:02,706
I've been
up to 75 miles an hour.

1022
01:05:03,846 --> 01:05:05,643
Smooth as silk.

1023
01:05:11,254 --> 01:05:16,590
The suspension system
really is remarkable.

1024
01:05:32,174 --> 01:05:34,404
May I see you again?

1025
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,573
Now you have to.

1026
01:06:24,427 --> 01:06:26,327
Pardon me, Cordelia.

1027
01:06:26,762 --> 01:06:30,425
My friends,
I'd like to offer a toast.

1028
01:06:30,499 --> 01:06:32,467
To our guests of honor.

1029
01:06:32,535 --> 01:06:34,435
And to the entire Marine Corps.

1030
01:06:34,503 --> 01:06:35,902
The most glorious institution

1031
01:06:35,972 --> 01:06:38,304
God ever put
on this broad, green Earth.

1032
01:06:38,374 --> 01:06:39,966
I recently traveled
to Washington

1033
01:06:40,042 --> 01:06:42,704
to see if anyone there
was concerned about this war

1034
01:06:42,778 --> 01:06:44,769
that's got half the world
in flames.

1035
01:06:44,847 --> 01:06:48,374
I was treated to a lot of
excuses and a lot of speeches.

1036
01:06:48,451 --> 01:06:50,112
Until I got to the Marines.

1037
01:06:50,186 --> 01:06:51,653
It's going to be a long evening.

1038
01:06:51,721 --> 01:06:54,349
When I talked to the Marine
commandant about preparedness,

1039
01:06:54,423 --> 01:06:55,981
he understood.

1040
01:06:56,058 --> 01:06:58,652
When I told him there were
5,000 men here in Philadelphia

1041
01:06:58,728 --> 01:07:01,595
ready and eager to be trained,
he was interested.

1042
01:07:01,664 --> 01:07:03,632
These three men
arrived this morning

1043
01:07:03,699 --> 01:07:05,132
as proof of his sincerity.

1044
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:07,692
They're going to work
with our Philadelphia Corps.

1045
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:10,796
And if war comes, by George,
we're going to be ready.

1046
01:07:10,873 --> 01:07:13,034
<i>? I believe in this country?</i>

1047
01:07:13,109 --> 01:07:15,100
<i>? But our country's
unprepared?</i>

1048
01:07:15,177 --> 01:07:18,078
<i>? Our defenses aren't worth
a hill of beans?</i>

1049
01:07:18,147 --> 01:07:20,479
<i>? So when a man loves
his country?</i>

1050
01:07:20,549 --> 01:07:22,449
<i>? Should he sit back
and complain?</i>

1051
01:07:22,518 --> 01:07:26,113
<i>? Or call out
the United States Marines??</i>

1052
01:07:26,622 --> 01:07:28,283
<i>? What's wrong with that??</i>

1053
01:07:28,357 --> 01:07:30,382
<i>? What's wrong with that??</i>

1054
01:07:30,459 --> 01:07:32,927
<i>? What better way,
what better means?</i>

1055
01:07:32,995 --> 01:07:36,362
<i>? To take my stand
with the Marines??</i>

1056
01:07:36,432 --> 01:07:38,423
<i>? What's wrong with that??</i>

1057
01:07:39,101 --> 01:07:41,194
To the Marine Corps.

1058
01:07:45,274 --> 01:07:48,175
Gentlemen, I want to say again,
it's good to have you with us.

1059
01:07:48,244 --> 01:07:49,836
Sir, is the Philadelphia Corps

1060
01:07:49,912 --> 01:07:52,107
the same thing
as the Biddle Bible classes?

1061
01:07:52,181 --> 01:07:53,546
Well, it grew out of that.

1062
01:07:53,616 --> 01:07:56,210
The Bible classes
are the hard core.

1063
01:07:56,285 --> 01:07:58,344
The core of the Corps.

1064
01:08:01,257 --> 01:08:02,690
Yes, you might say that.

1065
01:08:02,758 --> 01:08:04,419
Mr. Biddle,
you've done a swell job

1066
01:08:04,493 --> 01:08:06,188
getting all those men together.

1067
01:08:06,262 --> 01:08:07,456
I think it's great.

1068
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:09,998
A man like yourself
taking such an interest.

1069
01:08:10,066 --> 01:08:11,556
A man like myself?

1070
01:08:11,634 --> 01:08:14,603
Yes, an older man
with plenty of money.

1071
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:15,762
And I promise you, sir,

1072
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:17,863
we'll have them snapping to
in no time.

1073
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:20,670
Lieutenant, I already have them
snapping to.

1074
01:08:20,743 --> 01:08:22,301
I expect you
to take it from there.

1075
01:08:22,378 --> 01:08:24,778
- Will you take seconds?
- No, thank you.

1076
01:08:24,847 --> 01:08:27,338
The one thing my men need
is formal combat training.

1077
01:08:27,416 --> 01:08:30,078
I'm depending on
you gentlemen for that.

1078
01:08:30,152 --> 01:08:32,518
John, would you please
tell Mrs. Worth

1079
01:08:32,588 --> 01:08:35,113
that I'd like to serve dinner
as soon as possible?

1080
01:08:35,191 --> 01:08:36,419
Yes, ma'am.

1081
01:08:36,492 --> 01:08:38,892
It's trench fighting
that's going to win this war.

1082
01:08:38,961 --> 01:08:40,861
I want my men to learn
how to use a bayonet

1083
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:41,919
and the butt of a gun.

1084
01:08:41,997 --> 01:08:43,794
We've got a training program
set up.

1085
01:08:43,866 --> 01:08:45,265
Close combat is a part of it.

1086
01:08:45,334 --> 01:08:46,392
A big part, I hope.

1087
01:08:46,469 --> 01:08:47,663
It'll save lives.

1088
01:08:47,736 --> 01:08:49,704
I know I'm anxious to learn.

1089
01:08:49,772 --> 01:08:52,832
It's pretty strenuous exercise,
Mr. Biddle.

1090
01:08:53,676 --> 01:08:55,007
Is it, now?

1091
01:08:55,077 --> 01:08:57,739
Of course you'll be welcome
to observe, sir.

1092
01:08:59,448 --> 01:09:03,475
Gentlemen, may I show you
around the place?

1093
01:09:03,819 --> 01:09:05,616
We'll start with the stables.

1094
01:09:05,688 --> 01:09:07,679
This way, gentlemen.

1095
01:09:09,525 --> 01:09:12,790
The stables are right out here
across the terrace.

1096
01:09:12,862 --> 01:09:16,025
Dear, let's not move
the entire party outside.

1097
01:09:16,098 --> 01:09:18,931
It looks as if Anthony
might learn a lesson tonight.

1098
01:09:19,001 --> 01:09:21,128
I'm tempted to go out there
and watch myself.

1099
01:09:21,203 --> 01:09:23,103
Aunt Mary.

1100
01:09:23,172 --> 01:09:25,868
You forget that Anthony's
boxed with champions.

1101
01:09:25,941 --> 01:09:28,705
But they were friends, Cordelia.
And professionals.

1102
01:09:28,777 --> 01:09:30,438
These young men are not friends.

1103
01:09:30,513 --> 01:09:32,413
And there is
nothing so dangerous

1104
01:09:32,481 --> 01:09:34,949
as the inspired amateur.

1105
01:09:38,988 --> 01:09:41,980
Yes, I fixed this place up
to provide some healthy fun

1106
01:09:42,057 --> 01:09:45,390
and relaxation for myself
and the rest of the family.

1107
01:09:45,461 --> 01:09:49,557
Say, would any of you like to
go a round or two before dinner?

1108
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:52,664
How about you Marines?

1109
01:09:52,735 --> 01:09:54,669
Do any of you know how to box?

1110
01:09:54,737 --> 01:09:56,204
We all know how to box, sir.

1111
01:09:56,272 --> 01:09:58,900
- That's part of our training.
- Fine.

1112
01:09:59,642 --> 01:10:00,700
John!

1113
01:10:02,178 --> 01:10:03,839
You want to box with me, sir?

1114
01:10:03,913 --> 01:10:05,938
We'll just go a couple
of rounds, Lieutenant.

1115
01:10:06,015 --> 01:10:06,947
Thank you.

1116
01:10:07,016 --> 01:10:08,984
You know, a lot of older men

1117
01:10:09,051 --> 01:10:13,215
take up sports of one kind or
another just to pass the time.

1118
01:10:14,223 --> 01:10:15,690
John!

1119
01:10:15,758 --> 01:10:17,020
You yelled, sir?

1120
01:10:17,092 --> 01:10:19,492
Yes. Would you keep time
for us, John?

1121
01:10:21,964 --> 01:10:23,556
Yes, sir.

1122
01:10:25,868 --> 01:10:27,859
We box by college rules here,
Lieutenant.

1123
01:10:27,937 --> 01:10:29,199
Two-minute rounds.

1124
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:30,863
Thank you, John.

1125
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:34,073
Well, are you ready, Lieutenant?

1126
01:10:34,143 --> 01:10:35,633
Yes, sir.

1127
01:10:35,711 --> 01:10:37,645
All right, John.

1128
01:10:37,713 --> 01:10:39,078
Time, gentlemen.

1129
01:10:41,584 --> 01:10:43,848
The men in the Philadelphia
Corps have a lot to learn

1130
01:10:43,919 --> 01:10:46,513
about military science.

1131
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:50,083
But you will find them
well-disciplined.

1132
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:52,457
And physically fit.

1133
01:11:04,139 --> 01:11:05,834
So that's your style, is it?

1134
01:11:05,908 --> 01:11:08,399
Bill O'Brien used to lean
on his left like that.

1135
01:11:08,477 --> 01:11:11,412
Poor Billy never was
a really top fighter.

1136
01:11:18,454 --> 01:11:20,354
One thing to remember
about the Philadelphia Corps.

1137
01:11:20,422 --> 01:11:22,049
They're civilians.

1138
01:11:22,424 --> 01:11:24,858
You'll get a lot more
out of them if you lead them.

1139
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,588
Rather than bully them.

1140
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:28,956
Know what I mean?

1141
01:11:34,536 --> 01:11:35,730
Oh, Lieutenant!

1142
01:11:35,804 --> 01:11:37,396
Well, that was
just a lucky punch.

1143
01:11:37,473 --> 01:11:39,407
Might just as well
have happened to me.

1144
01:11:39,475 --> 01:11:40,567
Come on.

1145
01:11:40,643 --> 01:11:43,544
Yeah, that was quick thinking

1146
01:11:43,612 --> 01:11:46,206
catching old Jim Corbett
in your lap like that.

1147
01:11:46,282 --> 01:11:48,750
John, that's a bad spot
for old Jim up there.

1148
01:11:48,817 --> 01:11:50,375
I'll bet we've knocked him
off that wall

1149
01:11:50,452 --> 01:11:51,919
at least a dozen times.

1150
01:11:51,987 --> 01:11:55,081
You know, Corbett and I sparred
in this very ring several times.

1151
01:11:55,157 --> 01:11:56,681
He was a great fighter.

1152
01:11:56,759 --> 01:11:58,386
Well, who's next?

1153
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:00,928
Well, don't you think
we ought to go back, sir?

1154
01:12:00,996 --> 01:12:03,021
We wouldn't want to
delay dinner, sir.

1155
01:12:03,098 --> 01:12:04,895
That's very considerate.

1156
01:12:04,967 --> 01:12:06,764
We'll rejoin the ladies, then.

1157
01:12:06,835 --> 01:12:09,133
John, would you get some ice
for the lieutenant?

1158
01:12:09,204 --> 01:12:12,469
- It'll keep the swelling down.
- I'll bring some directly, sir.

1159
01:12:13,075 --> 01:12:15,635
As soon as I get Mr. Corbett
back up on the wall.

1160
01:12:15,711 --> 01:12:17,645
You know, I've worked up
a little appetite.

1161
01:12:18,914 --> 01:12:20,779
Yes, boxing always helps
my appetite.

1162
01:12:20,849 --> 01:12:22,840
Greatest sport in the world.

1163
01:12:28,991 --> 01:12:30,720
Mr. Biddle?

1164
01:12:31,193 --> 01:12:32,592
I've got a proposition.

1165
01:12:32,661 --> 01:12:35,789
If you won't tell the men
of the Philadelphia Corps

1166
01:12:35,864 --> 01:12:38,389
that you took the best boxer
among us in one round,

1167
01:12:38,467 --> 01:12:40,935
we'll teach you all
the close combat you want, sir.

1168
01:12:41,003 --> 01:12:42,834
Fine, fine.
I'm looking forward to it.

1169
01:12:42,905 --> 01:12:44,998
Say, gentlemen,
before we go in to dinner,

1170
01:12:45,074 --> 01:12:47,099
I want to show you
my alligators.

1171
01:12:47,176 --> 01:12:48,973
<i>? What's wrong with that??</i>

1172
01:12:49,044 --> 01:12:51,444
<i>? What's wrong with that??</i>

1173
01:12:52,247 --> 01:12:55,444
<i>? What better way,
what better means?</i>

1174
01:12:55,517 --> 01:12:59,180
<i>? To take your stand
with the Marines??</i>

1175
01:12:59,254 --> 01:13:01,381
<i>? What's wrong with that??</i>

1176
01:13:01,457 --> 01:13:06,224
<i>? What's wrong with that??</i>

1177
01:13:07,396 --> 01:13:09,296
Come on.
I'll show you the alligators.

1178
01:13:09,365 --> 01:13:11,492
I keep them in the conservatory.

1179
01:13:22,811 --> 01:13:25,336
The days of the custom car
are numbered.

1180
01:13:25,414 --> 01:13:27,109
Even in luxury automobiles,

1181
01:13:27,182 --> 01:13:30,083
standardization is
a practical necessity.

1182
01:13:30,152 --> 01:13:32,245
Not only for the manufacturer

1183
01:13:32,321 --> 01:13:34,812
but for the individual
car owner as well.

1184
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:36,687
Take a car like the Marmon.

1185
01:13:36,759 --> 01:13:38,249
I'd rather not.

1186
01:13:38,327 --> 01:13:39,521
Huh?

1187
01:13:39,595 --> 01:13:43,326
Angie, do you think we could
talk about something

1188
01:13:43,399 --> 01:13:46,766
besides automobiles
for a change?

1189
01:13:47,403 --> 01:13:48,665
World affairs.

1190
01:13:48,737 --> 01:13:50,568
Or the weather.

1191
01:13:50,639 --> 01:13:52,436
I'm sorry, Cordy.

1192
01:13:53,008 --> 01:13:54,873
Or you.

1193
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:57,776
I'd really love to
hear about you.

1194
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,077
Okay. Me.

1195
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:02,083
What kind of music do you like?

1196
01:14:02,151 --> 01:14:03,641
Music?

1197
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:05,687
What's your favorite book?

1198
01:14:05,754 --> 01:14:08,222
Let me see.
My favorite book.

1199
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:09,951
Let's talk about your career.

1200
01:14:10,025 --> 01:14:12,050
My career?

1201
01:14:13,328 --> 01:14:16,024
There's not much to tell.

1202
01:14:16,098 --> 01:14:17,065
We're in tobacco.

1203
01:14:17,132 --> 01:14:19,464
Do you like tobacco?

1204
01:14:19,535 --> 01:14:21,867
As a business, I mean.

1205
01:14:22,371 --> 01:14:23,804
I guess so.

1206
01:14:23,872 --> 01:14:25,430
You guess so?

1207
01:14:25,507 --> 01:14:27,771
I haven't thought
that much about it.

1208
01:14:27,843 --> 01:14:32,075
It's a family business, and I
guess I'll take it over someday.

1209
01:14:32,147 --> 01:14:35,139
Is there something
you'd rather do?

1210
01:14:37,085 --> 01:14:41,215
Yes, but you said you wanted to
talk about something else.

1211
01:14:44,126 --> 01:14:46,526
Oh, no.

1212
01:14:46,895 --> 01:14:51,628
You mean you want to make
a career out of automobiles?

1213
01:14:52,034 --> 01:14:56,937
<i>? There's a shining city
west of here?</i>

1214
01:14:57,005 --> 01:15:01,965
<i>? Where dreams
are booming into gear?</i>

1215
01:15:02,044 --> 01:15:06,913
<i>? It's no humdrum
nine-to-five town?</i>

1216
01:15:06,982 --> 01:15:17,859
<i>? It's a growing, going,
bright, alive town?</i>

1217
01:15:31,974 --> 01:15:35,967
<i>? Golden sparks
light up the skies there?</i>

1218
01:15:36,044 --> 01:15:39,707
<i>? Like a thousand
Fourth of Julys there?</i>

1219
01:15:39,781 --> 01:15:43,114
<i>? How I want to
stake a claim in?</i>

1220
01:15:43,185 --> 01:15:50,182
<i>? Roll up my sleeves
and make a name in?</i>

1221
01:15:50,259 --> 01:15:52,557
<i>? Detroit?</i>

1222
01:15:52,628 --> 01:15:53,560
Detroit?

1223
01:15:53,629 --> 01:15:55,324
Michigan.

1224
01:15:57,699 --> 01:16:01,692
<i>? You can hear it humming,
see it coming?</i>

1225
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:05,069
<i>? Feel it everywhere you go?</i>

1226
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:07,108
<i>? It's tomorrow morning?</i>

1227
01:16:07,175 --> 01:16:08,642
<i>? The future dawning?</i>

1228
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:12,339
<i>? With a bright
and shining glow?</i>

1229
01:16:12,414 --> 01:16:16,145
<i>? It's a land
where golden chariots?</i>

1230
01:16:16,218 --> 01:16:19,676
<i>? Are molded out of dreams?</i>

1231
01:16:19,755 --> 01:16:23,316
<i>? Detroit?</i>

1232
01:16:23,392 --> 01:16:26,987
<i>? Detroit?</i>

1233
01:16:27,062 --> 01:16:30,623
<i>? Detroit, Detroit?</i>

1234
01:16:30,699 --> 01:16:34,430
<i>? It's Detroit?</i>

1235
01:16:34,503 --> 01:16:38,405
<i>? Oh, if I could be there,
I'd be free there?</i>

1236
01:16:38,473 --> 01:16:41,738
<i>? Standing on my own two feet?</i>

1237
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:45,337
<i>? I'd invent new motors,
design new rotors?</i>

1238
01:16:45,414 --> 01:16:48,906
<i>? I'd be in the driver's seat?</i>

1239
01:16:48,984 --> 01:16:52,886
<i>? I'd make
all my dreams realities?</i>

1240
01:16:52,955 --> 01:16:56,288
<i>? Oh, I'd be on my way?</i>

1241
01:16:56,358 --> 01:17:00,089
<i>? In Detroit?</i>

1242
01:17:00,162 --> 01:17:03,689
<i>? Detroit?</i>

1243
01:17:03,765 --> 01:17:07,201
<i>? Detroit, Detroit?</i>

1244
01:17:07,269 --> 01:17:11,296
<i>? In Detroit?</i>

1245
01:17:11,373 --> 01:17:18,438
<i>? Others are giving
their dreams a try?</i>

1246
01:17:18,513 --> 01:17:22,381
<i>? If others can dream there?</i>

1247
01:17:22,451 --> 01:17:30,256
<i>? Why can't I??</i>

1248
01:17:30,325 --> 01:17:33,453
Cordy, you'd be amazed at the
things they're doing out there.

1249
01:17:33,528 --> 01:17:35,621
They're working on
a two-range transmission.

1250
01:17:35,697 --> 01:17:38,165
Four-wheel brakes.

1251
01:17:39,501 --> 01:17:42,436
Do you think they could do
something about the seats?

1252
01:17:42,504 --> 01:17:44,267
Sure.
That's easy.

1253
01:17:44,339 --> 01:17:47,467
And heat the inside?

1254
01:17:47,542 --> 01:17:50,534
Why not? There's hot water
in the radiator.

1255
01:17:51,013 --> 01:17:54,414
How about a gramophone so we
could have music on long trips?

1256
01:17:54,483 --> 01:17:55,882
Sure.
It's possible.

1257
01:17:55,951 --> 01:17:59,045
And any color you want?

1258
01:17:59,121 --> 01:18:00,884
I don't know about that.

1259
01:18:02,457 --> 01:18:05,915
Okay.
Any color you want.

1260
01:18:05,994 --> 01:18:12,558
<i>? So you see
where the rainbow ends for me?</i>

1261
01:18:12,634 --> 01:18:19,631
<i>? Is known to the world
as F. O.B.?</i>

1262
01:18:19,708 --> 01:18:25,044
<i>? Detroit?</i>

1263
01:18:38,827 --> 01:18:39,953
What is it?

1264
01:18:40,028 --> 01:18:41,518
I don't know.

1265
01:18:41,596 --> 01:18:43,325
I'll find out.

1266
01:18:47,335 --> 01:18:48,825
Cordy.

1267
01:18:49,271 --> 01:18:51,501
You think I'm crazy?

1268
01:18:51,573 --> 01:18:53,200
About Detroit, I mean.

1269
01:18:53,275 --> 01:18:55,573
Boy, my mother does.

1270
01:18:56,144 --> 01:19:02,674
<i>? If you hear it humming,
see it coming?</i>

1271
01:19:02,751 --> 01:19:07,518
<i>? That's the place
where you must go?</i>

1272
01:19:07,589 --> 01:19:10,820
<i>? But to make your name there?</i>

1273
01:19:10,892 --> 01:19:13,190
<i>? You must stake
your claim there?</i>

1274
01:19:13,261 --> 01:19:19,325
<i>? And let no one tell you no?</i>

1275
01:19:19,401 --> 01:19:21,665
Then you don't think I'm crazy.

1276
01:19:21,737 --> 01:19:27,972
<i>? Then my dreams
of golden chariots?</i>

1277
01:19:28,043 --> 01:19:36,246
<i>? In Detroit
can all come true?</i>

1278
01:19:36,585 --> 01:19:40,988
<i>? For you hear it humming?</i>

1279
01:19:41,056 --> 01:19:45,550
<i>? And you see it coming?</i>

1280
01:19:45,627 --> 01:19:50,826
<i>? And you?</i>

1281
01:19:50,899 --> 01:20:02,436
<i>? Want to be there, too?</i>

1282
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:29,860
Hurry!

1283
01:20:47,823 --> 01:20:51,224
Well, those men
looked good tonight.

1284
01:20:52,527 --> 01:20:54,688
Yes, sir.
Like seasoned troopers.

1285
01:20:54,763 --> 01:20:56,253
Don't you think
they looked good?

1286
01:20:56,331 --> 01:20:57,525
Yes, dear.

1287
01:20:57,599 --> 01:20:59,829
They looked cold, too.

1288
01:20:59,901 --> 01:21:02,392
I was sorry for them.

1289
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:04,734
They're going to have to
fight battles in cold weather.

1290
01:21:04,806 --> 01:21:06,205
I wasn't criticizing, dear.

1291
01:21:06,274 --> 01:21:08,538
It was a lovely parade.

1292
01:21:09,945 --> 01:21:12,379
- It's cold in here.
- Yes, it is.

1293
01:21:12,447 --> 01:21:15,211
Yeah, I think
the furnace must be off.

1294
01:21:15,817 --> 01:21:17,341
No.
The radiator's hot.

1295
01:21:17,419 --> 01:21:20,980
Yeah, there's a terrible draft
coming from somewhere.

1296
01:21:22,123 --> 01:21:24,455
The conservatory, I think.

1297
01:21:24,526 --> 01:21:26,187
The conservatory?

1298
01:21:36,771 --> 01:21:38,500
John!

1299
01:21:40,742 --> 01:21:42,232
My alligators.

1300
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:44,676
Look at my alligators.

1301
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:46,677
John!

1302
01:21:48,383 --> 01:21:50,078
George.

1303
01:21:52,921 --> 01:21:55,014
John!

1304
01:21:55,090 --> 01:21:57,650
Yes, sir?
You yelled, sir?

1305
01:21:57,726 --> 01:22:00,160
What's happened here?
Why are these windows open?

1306
01:22:00,228 --> 01:22:02,389
It must have been
the new maid, sir.

1307
01:22:03,465 --> 01:22:04,693
What new maid?

1308
01:22:04,766 --> 01:22:06,529
Her name is Florence, dear.

1309
01:22:06,601 --> 01:22:08,034
She started this afternoon.

1310
01:22:08,103 --> 01:22:09,570
She was complaining
about the smell.

1311
01:22:09,638 --> 01:22:11,435
- What smell?
- The alligators.

1312
01:22:11,506 --> 01:22:13,838
- They do have a certain...
- What?

1313
01:22:14,409 --> 01:22:16,741
We're accustomed to it, dear.

1314
01:22:16,811 --> 01:22:18,369
Oh.

1315
01:22:18,446 --> 01:22:21,210
She probably decided to
give the room an airing...

1316
01:22:21,716 --> 01:22:23,274
and forgot to close up again.

1317
01:22:23,351 --> 01:22:26,081
Well, of all
the blasted, stupid...

1318
01:22:26,154 --> 01:22:27,621
Get an ax.

1319
01:22:27,989 --> 01:22:28,717
Anthony!

1320
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:30,553
Not for Florence.
For the alligators.

1321
01:22:30,625 --> 01:22:32,115
Maybe they're still alive.

1322
01:22:32,193 --> 01:22:33,353
We'll chop 'em out.

1323
01:22:33,428 --> 01:22:35,419
An ax! Move!

1324
01:23:01,289 --> 01:23:04,315
Dead, dead, dead.

1325
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:06,627
Get some more towels, John.

1326
01:23:06,695 --> 01:23:08,219
Yes, ma'am.

1327
01:23:09,531 --> 01:23:12,591
Anthony, it's after midnight.

1328
01:23:12,667 --> 01:23:13,861
Yeah.

1329
01:23:14,569 --> 01:23:15,900
I hate to give up.

1330
01:23:15,971 --> 01:23:16,903
I know, dear.

1331
01:23:16,972 --> 01:23:18,769
But there comes a time.

1332
01:23:20,608 --> 01:23:22,576
I'll get it.

1333
01:23:34,856 --> 01:23:37,154
Dead, dead, dead.

1334
01:23:37,726 --> 01:23:39,284
Hello?

1335
01:23:39,361 --> 01:23:41,693
Yes, this is Mr. Biddle.
Who's calling?

1336
01:23:42,197 --> 01:23:43,528
Oh, yes.

1337
01:23:44,866 --> 01:23:46,663
How long ago?

1338
01:23:47,369 --> 01:23:50,270
What have you done about it?
Have you called the police?

1339
01:23:50,338 --> 01:23:52,636
- Then call them, blast it!
- What is it, Anthony?

1340
01:23:52,707 --> 01:23:56,074
I want that blasted town
turned upside down, do you hear?

1341
01:23:56,144 --> 01:23:56,940
All right.

1342
01:23:57,012 --> 01:23:59,003
Call me back
the minute you know anything.

1343
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:00,104
- Is it Cordy?
- Yes.

1344
01:24:00,181 --> 01:24:01,409
- She's missing.
- Missing?

1345
01:24:01,483 --> 01:24:03,417
Three hours past curfew,
and nobody there

1346
01:24:03,485 --> 01:24:05,248
has any idea where she is.

1347
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:07,618
That's a fine way to
run a prison.

1348
01:24:07,689 --> 01:24:09,520
You don't suppose
she's been kidnapped?

1349
01:24:09,591 --> 01:24:12,321
- For heaven's sake.
- Well, it happens.

1350
01:24:15,730 --> 01:24:16,662
Operator!

1351
01:24:16,731 --> 01:24:18,460
- Don't do anything foolish.
- Foolish?

1352
01:24:18,533 --> 01:24:19,966
Our daughter is
heaven knows where.

1353
01:24:20,035 --> 01:24:21,696
- Operator!
- Hello.

1354
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:23,465
Cordy.

1355
01:24:24,939 --> 01:24:26,372
Mother.

1356
01:24:26,441 --> 01:24:27,373
Cordy.

1357
01:24:27,442 --> 01:24:28,466
Papa.

1358
01:24:28,543 --> 01:24:29,874
Are you all right?

1359
01:24:29,944 --> 01:24:31,206
Of course I'm all right.

1360
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:32,712
You're not hurt in any way?

1361
01:24:32,781 --> 01:24:34,078
What are you talking about?

1362
01:24:34,149 --> 01:24:37,050
We just had a call
from Miss Wingfield.

1363
01:24:37,118 --> 01:24:38,745
Oh.

1364
01:24:39,487 --> 01:24:41,546
I was hoping we'd get here
before that happened.

1365
01:24:41,623 --> 01:24:42,817
The weather held us up.

1366
01:24:42,891 --> 01:24:43,983
Us?

1367
01:24:44,059 --> 01:24:46,459
Is someone with you, Cordy?

1368
01:24:48,029 --> 01:24:49,496
Yes.

1369
01:24:54,536 --> 01:24:56,766
My fiancé.

1370
01:24:59,107 --> 01:25:00,506
Your...

1371
01:25:00,575 --> 01:25:02,600
Your what?

1372
01:25:03,211 --> 01:25:05,406
His name
is Angier Buchanan Duke.

1373
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:07,380
He's in the car.

1374
01:25:08,817 --> 01:25:09,909
Do you mean to tell me

1375
01:25:09,984 --> 01:25:12,350
that some boy is sitting
in front of this house

1376
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:13,944
thinking he's going to
marry you?

1377
01:25:14,022 --> 01:25:15,387
Anthony, please.

1378
01:25:15,457 --> 01:25:17,948
He wanted to make sure
I got in all right.

1379
01:25:18,026 --> 01:25:20,153
I'll tell him he can go now.

1380
01:25:20,228 --> 01:25:21,217
Good night!

1381
01:25:21,296 --> 01:25:22,991
Good night?

1382
01:25:23,064 --> 01:25:25,089
Aren't you going to ask him in?

1383
01:25:25,166 --> 01:25:27,532
No, Mother, I don't think so.

1384
01:25:28,736 --> 01:25:31,296
I'll call you in the morning!

1385
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:37,740
We don't even get
a chance to see him?

1386
01:25:37,812 --> 01:25:39,837
Of course you'll see him.

1387
01:25:39,914 --> 01:25:40,881
When you're ready.

1388
01:25:40,949 --> 01:25:42,348
I'm ready now.

1389
01:25:42,417 --> 01:25:44,078
No, Papa.

1390
01:25:44,152 --> 01:25:46,245
I'm not gonna let you at him.

1391
01:25:46,321 --> 01:25:48,414
Not until you get used to
the idea.

1392
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:50,458
Where did you meet
this young man, Cordy?

1393
01:25:50,525 --> 01:25:52,493
At a party Aunt Gladys
and Uncle Bill gave.

1394
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:53,652
I wrote you about it.

1395
01:25:53,728 --> 01:25:55,662
You didn't write us
about getting engaged.

1396
01:25:55,730 --> 01:25:57,994
He didn't ask me until today.

1397
01:25:58,066 --> 01:25:59,397
What took him so long?

1398
01:25:59,467 --> 01:26:01,799
Oh, now, Anthony.

1399
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:04,065
Papa.

1400
01:26:04,139 --> 01:26:06,699
I think you'll
really like him very much

1401
01:26:06,774 --> 01:26:09,242
if you just give him a chance.

1402
01:26:09,811 --> 01:26:12,746
Of course
we'll give him a chance.

1403
01:26:12,814 --> 01:26:14,714
Is I dreaming, I am?

1404
01:26:14,782 --> 01:26:16,443
Hello, John.

1405
01:26:16,518 --> 01:26:18,008
Oh, you look fine.

1406
01:26:18,086 --> 01:26:19,110
Because I'm happy.

1407
01:26:19,187 --> 01:26:20,779
I'm engaged!

1408
01:26:20,855 --> 01:26:23,085
Engaged, is it?
Well, isn't that grand?

1409
01:26:23,158 --> 01:26:24,318
I'm very happy for you.

1410
01:26:24,392 --> 01:26:26,360
Isn't that wonderful news,
Mrs. Biddle?

1411
01:26:26,427 --> 01:26:28,452
Isn't it just...

1412
01:26:28,530 --> 01:26:31,124
I'd best be getting these towels
into the parlor.

1413
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:32,257
Towels?

1414
01:26:32,333 --> 01:26:35,769
We had a sort of accident
this evening.

1415
01:26:35,837 --> 01:26:37,828
But I think we should
all go up to bed now

1416
01:26:37,906 --> 01:26:39,601
and talk in the morning.

1417
01:26:40,208 --> 01:26:42,403
I am tired.

1418
01:26:42,744 --> 01:26:44,302
We got stuck in the snow twice.

1419
01:26:44,379 --> 01:26:46,279
And we thought
we'd broken the axle.

1420
01:26:46,347 --> 01:26:48,941
And then the fan belt came off.

1421
01:26:49,017 --> 01:26:50,609
But it was fun.

1422
01:26:50,685 --> 01:26:51,947
Good night, Mother.

1423
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:53,385
Good night, darling.

1424
01:26:53,454 --> 01:26:55,422
It's so nice to be home.

1425
01:27:00,528 --> 01:27:02,291
I love you, Papa.

1426
01:27:07,135 --> 01:27:08,295
Good night.

1427
01:27:10,071 --> 01:27:12,005
Good night.

1428
01:27:17,045 --> 01:27:18,637
"My fiancé," she says.

1429
01:27:18,713 --> 01:27:20,010
Without batting an eye.

1430
01:27:20,081 --> 01:27:22,140
And you just stand there.

1431
01:27:22,483 --> 01:27:24,144
And I just stand there.

1432
01:27:24,219 --> 01:27:26,983
What else could we do?
We've never met the young man.

1433
01:27:27,055 --> 01:27:28,352
We don't know
anything about him.

1434
01:27:28,423 --> 01:27:30,448
What's that got to do with it?
She's a child.

1435
01:27:30,525 --> 01:27:31,822
She's a young woman.

1436
01:27:31,893 --> 01:27:33,793
You can't hold back
the clocks, Anthony.

1437
01:27:33,861 --> 01:27:36,091
Cordelia, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1438
01:27:36,164 --> 01:27:38,098
I'm not trying to
hold back any clocks.

1439
01:27:38,166 --> 01:27:39,463
She's not ready for marriage.

1440
01:27:39,534 --> 01:27:40,831
You're not ready.

1441
01:27:40,902 --> 01:27:42,426
I'm not going to
sit still for it.

1442
01:27:42,503 --> 01:27:45,734
Anthony, you'll be making the
greatest mistake of your life

1443
01:27:45,807 --> 01:27:47,775
if you try to stop
this engagement.

1444
01:27:47,842 --> 01:27:50,504
Is it wrong for me to try to
protect my daughter?

1445
01:27:50,578 --> 01:27:52,671
Cordy has a mind of her own.

1446
01:27:52,747 --> 01:27:53,873
Faced with an obstacle,

1447
01:27:53,948 --> 01:27:57,816
she will proceed with
still greater determination.

1448
01:27:58,553 --> 01:28:01,351
Why, you, of all people,
ought to know that.

1449
01:28:02,123 --> 01:28:04,853
We don't want to push her
into an elopement.

1450
01:28:07,862 --> 01:28:09,329
Come on.

1451
01:28:10,531 --> 01:28:14,399
You know, I'm anxious to see
what he looks like.

1452
01:28:14,469 --> 01:28:16,903
I believe you're enjoying this.

1453
01:28:16,971 --> 01:28:18,996
Well, in a way, I am.

1454
01:28:19,073 --> 01:28:21,837
It's a very exciting time.

1455
01:28:21,909 --> 01:28:26,107
Cordelia,
sometimes you amaze me.

1456
01:28:26,447 --> 01:28:28,779
Well, I hope so, Anthony.

1457
01:28:39,193 --> 01:28:41,684
It never rains but it pours.

1458
01:28:41,763 --> 01:28:44,459
To lose your only daughter
and your pet alligators

1459
01:28:44,532 --> 01:28:47,092
all on the same black night.

1460
01:29:09,557 --> 01:29:10,854
What's all the...

1461
01:29:10,925 --> 01:29:12,688
Oh!

1462
01:29:16,197 --> 01:29:18,165
Anthony, what are
you doing down there?

1463
01:29:18,232 --> 01:29:19,426
The girl's crazy.

1464
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,127
That stuff she uses to
color her hair

1465
01:29:21,202 --> 01:29:23,193
must have gone to her brain.

1466
01:29:24,005 --> 01:29:25,905
Miss, would you mind
telling me what...

1467
01:29:28,309 --> 01:29:30,243
What's going on?

1468
01:29:33,514 --> 01:29:34,981
Well...

1469
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:38,011
Well, I'll be.

1470
01:29:38,086 --> 01:29:39,713
Anthony, what is it?

1471
01:29:39,787 --> 01:29:41,516
Everything's all right now.

1472
01:29:41,589 --> 01:29:44,149
That nitwit girl frighten you?

1473
01:29:44,225 --> 01:29:46,352
They're not dead!

1474
01:29:46,794 --> 01:29:48,193
John!

1475
01:29:48,596 --> 01:29:49,688
John!

1476
01:29:49,764 --> 01:29:50,696
Yes, sir?

1477
01:29:50,765 --> 01:29:52,562
John, they're not dead!

1478
01:29:52,633 --> 01:29:55,329
Yes, sir.
I know, sir.

1479
01:29:55,403 --> 01:29:56,870
Come on, George.

1480
01:29:56,938 --> 01:29:57,870
George!

1481
01:29:57,939 --> 01:30:00,407
Cordelia, it's George.

1482
01:30:02,810 --> 01:30:04,368
What is it, Papa?

1483
01:30:04,445 --> 01:30:06,242
They're not dead.

1484
01:30:17,992 --> 01:30:18,924
George.

1485
01:30:18,993 --> 01:30:20,392
George, come back here.

1486
01:30:26,634 --> 01:30:28,101
Allow me, sir.

1487
01:30:28,169 --> 01:30:29,227
George!

1488
01:30:31,406 --> 01:30:32,532
George, not outside.

1489
01:30:32,607 --> 01:30:34,802
You'll freeze all over again.

1490
01:30:43,451 --> 01:30:45,351
Here you are, Mother.

1491
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:48,250
All right.
Out of there.

1492
01:30:50,024 --> 01:30:52,151
Run along now.

1493
01:30:52,226 --> 01:30:53,716
In the conservatory.

1494
01:30:53,795 --> 01:30:55,126
Ah-ah.

1495
01:30:56,464 --> 01:30:58,125
Thank you.

1496
01:31:00,368 --> 01:31:02,302
Come on.
You heard what Mother said.

1497
01:31:02,370 --> 01:31:04,167
Into the conservatory.

1498
01:31:05,373 --> 01:31:06,362
George?

1499
01:31:08,242 --> 01:31:09,869
Did George come
back in here again?

1500
01:31:09,944 --> 01:31:11,434
I didn't see him, dear.

1501
01:31:11,512 --> 01:31:13,241
Take a look
in the dining room, John.

1502
01:31:13,314 --> 01:31:14,645
Where do you suppose he got to?

1503
01:31:14,715 --> 01:31:17,809
There's breakfast to get on
the table, in case you forgot.

1504
01:31:17,885 --> 01:31:21,184
How can you be so calm with
those monsters on the loose?

1505
01:31:21,255 --> 01:31:23,689
They know better
than to get in my way.

1506
01:31:23,758 --> 01:31:27,922
You can fill the cream pitcher
and get busy settin' the table.

1507
01:31:45,546 --> 01:31:46,945
Idiot girl.

1508
01:31:47,014 --> 01:31:49,482
None of them stay very long.

1509
01:31:49,550 --> 01:31:52,917
I'll teach you to make yourself
at home in my kitchen!

1510
01:32:01,863 --> 01:32:03,023
Come out, I say!

1511
01:32:06,133 --> 01:32:08,328
Me new broom.

1512
01:32:08,402 --> 01:32:09,562
You drop that!

1513
01:32:09,637 --> 01:32:11,798
Drop it, I say!

1514
01:32:15,142 --> 01:32:16,609
Where you going, you beast?

1515
01:32:16,677 --> 01:32:19,669
You'd be a handbag
if I had my way.

1516
01:32:23,184 --> 01:32:24,651
You should've let out a call.

1517
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:26,152
I'd have given you a hand.

1518
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:27,619
Thank you, Mr. Lawless.

1519
01:32:27,688 --> 01:32:29,087
It wasn't necessary.

1520
01:32:29,156 --> 01:32:31,818
I managed very well on me own.

1521
01:32:32,593 --> 01:32:34,686
Breakfast will be
in half an hour.

1522
01:32:34,762 --> 01:32:36,753
I have to slice some more bacon.

1523
01:32:36,831 --> 01:32:38,924
Thank you, Mrs. Worth.

1524
01:32:39,467 --> 01:32:42,527
Well, I think
we'd better get dressed.

1525
01:32:42,603 --> 01:32:45,572
That girl may come back here
with the police.

1526
01:32:47,174 --> 01:32:48,698
Cordy.

1527
01:32:48,776 --> 01:32:50,437
Yes, Papa?

1528
01:32:51,045 --> 01:32:52,842
Cordy, I've been
thinking things over.

1529
01:32:52,914 --> 01:32:55,940
I realize
I acted badly last night.

1530
01:32:56,017 --> 01:32:59,316
I want you to invite your
young man to dinner so I can,

1531
01:32:59,387 --> 01:33:02,481
as you say, give him a chance.

1532
01:33:06,227 --> 01:33:08,218
Thank you, Papa.

1533
01:33:11,499 --> 01:33:13,967
Well, you know, I worked up
quite an appetite.

1534
01:33:14,035 --> 01:33:16,333
I think I'd rather have
scrapple than bacon.

1535
01:33:16,404 --> 01:33:17,928
Mrs. Worth.

1536
01:33:19,173 --> 01:33:20,333
Thank you, Mother.

1537
01:33:20,408 --> 01:33:21,466
What for, darling?

1538
01:33:21,542 --> 01:33:24,272
For helping Papa
change his mind.

1539
01:33:24,645 --> 01:33:26,476
Did I do that?

1540
01:33:26,547 --> 01:33:28,071
Are you sure?

1541
01:33:28,149 --> 01:33:29,673
Oh!

1542
01:33:34,255 --> 01:33:36,314
There's an old Irish proverb.

1543
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:38,358
To have your alligators
thawed out

1544
01:33:38,426 --> 01:33:41,554
and your daughter forgive you
all on the same bright day,

1545
01:33:41,629 --> 01:33:43,324
that's fortuosity.

1546
01:33:43,397 --> 01:33:45,297
- John?
- Sir?

1547
01:33:45,633 --> 01:33:47,965
Who are you talking to?

1548
01:33:48,035 --> 01:33:49,798
No one, sir.

1549
01:33:50,972 --> 01:33:54,408
You know what they say about
people who talk to themselves.

1550
01:34:10,458 --> 01:34:11,447
It's like I said.

1551
01:34:11,525 --> 01:34:13,049
It's another case of...

1552
01:34:13,127 --> 01:34:15,857
<i>? Fortuosity?</i>

1553
01:34:15,930 --> 01:34:19,559
<i>? That's me byword?</i>

1554
01:34:21,602 --> 01:34:25,333
<i>? Fortuosity means?</i>

1555
01:34:25,906 --> 01:34:27,066
George?

1556
01:34:31,278 --> 01:34:32,302
George?

1557
01:34:35,716 --> 01:34:41,154
<i>? Round the corner?</i>

1558
01:34:41,222 --> 01:34:42,655
Ha ha!

1559
01:34:42,723 --> 01:34:44,486
George?

1560
01:34:45,059 --> 01:34:46,856
George?

1561
01:34:46,927 --> 01:34:49,555
I've had about as much
as I can stand, now, George!

1562
01:34:49,630 --> 01:34:51,928
George!

1563
01:34:54,001 --> 01:34:55,662
In the tank.

1564
01:34:58,439 --> 01:35:01,340
Will you get in the tank
when I tell you?

1565
01:35:02,710 --> 01:35:03,734
Right.

1566
01:35:05,413 --> 01:35:06,402
George!

1567
01:35:16,223 --> 01:35:17,815
George.

1568
01:35:18,259 --> 01:35:20,921
Will you come back here?

1569
01:35:20,995 --> 01:35:22,462
Come on.

1570
01:35:48,656 --> 01:35:51,284
Oh, did I frighten you, then?

1571
01:35:57,998 --> 01:35:59,727
Hey, George.

1572
01:36:01,936 --> 01:36:05,229
George!

1573
01:36:07,742 --> 01:36:10,142
Not in the music room.

1574
01:36:17,151 --> 01:36:18,448
Get in...

1575
01:36:18,519 --> 01:36:19,645
George.

1576
01:36:29,330 --> 01:36:30,922
Come on, George.
Up.

1577
01:36:30,998 --> 01:36:33,091
Hey!
That's a good lad.

1578
01:36:33,167 --> 01:36:34,395
There you go.

1579
01:36:34,468 --> 01:36:35,765
Come on, boy.
This way, lad.

1580
01:36:35,836 --> 01:36:37,133
That's a good lad.

1581
01:36:37,204 --> 01:36:39,331
There you go.

1582
01:36:39,406 --> 01:36:41,101
It's like I said.

1583
01:36:41,175 --> 01:36:47,307
<i>? Every bit of life is lit
by fortuosity?</i>

1584
01:36:47,381 --> 01:36:49,144
<i>? And that's me byword?</i>

1585
01:36:49,216 --> 01:36:54,677
<i>? Every bit of life is lit by?</i>

1586
01:36:54,755 --> 01:36:57,121
<i>? Twinkle-in-the-eye word?</i>

1587
01:36:57,191 --> 01:37:00,649
<i>? Every bit of life is lit?</i>

1588
01:37:00,728 --> 01:37:07,566
<i>? By fortuosity?</i>

1589
01:37:07,635 --> 01:37:08,693
Aah!

1590
01:37:11,238 --> 01:37:12,466
John!

1591
01:37:14,642 --> 01:37:16,007
Coming, sir.

1592
01:37:16,076 --> 01:37:17,737
George.

1593
01:39:31,378 --> 01:39:33,903
Yes, it can only be
a matter of weeks now.

1594
01:39:33,981 --> 01:39:37,075
Even the White House admits
we can't stay out of this war.

1595
01:39:37,151 --> 01:39:39,449
I tried to enlist.
Do you know what they told me?

1596
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:40,578
"You're too old."

1597
01:39:40,654 --> 01:39:42,588
Me, in the prime of life.
Fit as a fiddle.

1598
01:39:42,656 --> 01:39:43,588
"Too old."

1599
01:39:43,657 --> 01:39:44,919
No more wine, Mr. Duke?

1600
01:39:44,992 --> 01:39:47,517
No thank you, Mr. Biddle.
I still have a full glass.

1601
01:39:47,594 --> 01:39:48,754
Don't you like the wine?

1602
01:39:48,829 --> 01:39:50,296
We have others.
A cellarful.

1603
01:39:50,364 --> 01:39:52,525
No, thank you. No.
I don't drink very much.

1604
01:39:52,599 --> 01:39:54,089
It goes right to my head.

1605
01:39:54,168 --> 01:39:56,363
That's where
it's supposed to go.

1606
01:39:56,937 --> 01:39:59,337
So you live in New York,
Mr. Duke.

1607
01:39:59,406 --> 01:40:00,395
Yes, ma'am. I do.

1608
01:40:00,474 --> 01:40:01,702
Do you like it?

1609
01:40:01,775 --> 01:40:03,868
Well, yes.
I guess so.

1610
01:40:03,944 --> 01:40:06,071
I never could stand
the place, myself.

1611
01:40:07,081 --> 01:40:09,379
- How about your work?
- Sir?

1612
01:40:09,450 --> 01:40:11,441
Do you enjoy working?

1613
01:40:11,919 --> 01:40:12,886
Well, no.

1614
01:40:12,953 --> 01:40:14,614
Not really.

1615
01:40:14,688 --> 01:40:16,622
- To tell you the truth...
- I don't blame you.

1616
01:40:16,690 --> 01:40:18,885
Offices are deadly places.

1617
01:40:18,959 --> 01:40:20,517
They confine a man.

1618
01:40:20,594 --> 01:40:22,425
Spiritually and physically.

1619
01:40:23,464 --> 01:40:26,024
What do you do to escape?

1620
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:27,089
Escape, sir?

1621
01:40:27,167 --> 01:40:29,431
Yes.
Do you go in for sports?

1622
01:40:29,703 --> 01:40:31,193
Well, I have a boat.

1623
01:40:31,271 --> 01:40:32,602
A boat?

1624
01:40:32,673 --> 01:40:34,106
A yacht, Papa.

1625
01:40:34,174 --> 01:40:36,233
Oh.
A yacht.

1626
01:40:37,244 --> 01:40:40,338
Well, I suppose a man
can get a kick out of a yacht.

1627
01:40:40,981 --> 01:40:42,471
Do you?

1628
01:40:43,117 --> 01:40:44,311
Do I what, sir?

1629
01:40:44,385 --> 01:40:46,751
Get a kick out of
your blasted yacht.

1630
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:51,257
Well, I haven't been on it
for a while.

1631
01:40:51,325 --> 01:40:54,226
I suppose you've been busy
getting ready for the war.

1632
01:40:54,595 --> 01:40:57,530
Angie's gonna
turn his boat over, Papa.

1633
01:40:57,598 --> 01:40:58,826
Turn it over.

1634
01:40:58,899 --> 01:41:01,333
Well, that's a good thing
to do with a boat.

1635
01:41:01,902 --> 01:41:04,598
To the Coast Guard, Papa.

1636
01:41:04,671 --> 01:41:05,797
Oh.

1637
01:41:05,873 --> 01:41:08,307
Mother thought it would
be a good idea.

1638
01:41:08,876 --> 01:41:10,434
I see.

1639
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:14,513
Tell me, Mr. Duke.

1640
01:41:14,581 --> 01:41:16,048
What else do you like?

1641
01:41:16,116 --> 01:41:17,708
Besides sailing, I mean.

1642
01:41:17,785 --> 01:41:20,015
Hiking? Skiing?

1643
01:41:20,354 --> 01:41:22,788
I broke an ankle once skiing.

1644
01:41:22,856 --> 01:41:25,188
Did you get back up
on those skis and try again?

1645
01:41:25,259 --> 01:41:26,419
No, sir.

1646
01:41:26,493 --> 01:41:27,892
Well, you should have.

1647
01:41:28,762 --> 01:41:31,822
Well, the bone
was kind of sticking out.

1648
01:41:31,899 --> 01:41:33,093
Oh.

1649
01:41:36,670 --> 01:41:39,264
Oh, that's right.
It goes to your head.

1650
01:41:40,107 --> 01:41:42,598
Do you do any fishing
or hunting?

1651
01:41:42,676 --> 01:41:44,405
Or do you box?

1652
01:41:44,478 --> 01:41:45,467
No, sir.

1653
01:41:45,546 --> 01:41:47,309
I just don't seem to have
the time.

1654
01:41:47,381 --> 01:41:49,542
You should take the time.

1655
01:41:49,883 --> 01:41:51,714
I was a sickly child, Mr. Duke.

1656
01:41:51,785 --> 01:41:52,717
Asthma.

1657
01:41:52,786 --> 01:41:55,346
Then when I was 10,
I came down with typhoid fever.

1658
01:41:55,422 --> 01:41:57,617
"That's it," they said.
"He'll never make it."

1659
01:41:57,691 --> 01:41:59,454
But I did make it.

1660
01:41:59,526 --> 01:42:02,256
And somehow the fever
killed the asthma.

1661
01:42:02,329 --> 01:42:03,455
It was like a miracle.

1662
01:42:03,530 --> 01:42:07,159
And do you know what I learned
at that early age, Mr. Duke?

1663
01:42:07,234 --> 01:42:10,533
That life is a precious
and wonderful thing.

1664
01:42:10,604 --> 01:42:13,232
But you just can't sit there
and let it lap around you.

1665
01:42:13,307 --> 01:42:16,003
You have to dive into it.
Taste it. Feel it.

1666
01:42:16,076 --> 01:42:17,407
You have to use it.

1667
01:42:17,478 --> 01:42:20,777
And the more you use,
the more you have.

1668
01:42:20,848 --> 01:42:22,509
That's the wonder of it.

1669
01:42:28,288 --> 01:42:30,813
Would you like some
more dessert, Mr. Duke?

1670
01:42:30,891 --> 01:42:32,586
No, thank you, Mrs. Biddle.

1671
01:42:32,659 --> 01:42:34,752
It's delicious, though.

1672
01:42:37,164 --> 01:42:39,462
Is something wrong, Mr. Duke?

1673
01:42:39,533 --> 01:42:41,660
Well, lookit there.

1674
01:42:43,570 --> 01:42:45,970
Well, it's Lucy.

1675
01:42:46,039 --> 01:42:49,031
I'll bet she's been hiding under
there all day where it's warm.

1676
01:42:49,109 --> 01:42:50,133
John!

1677
01:42:50,210 --> 01:42:52,235
John, look what I found.

1678
01:42:54,581 --> 01:42:57,106
Are you all right, Mr. Duke?

1679
01:42:57,184 --> 01:42:58,617
Yes.
Thank you.

1680
01:42:58,685 --> 01:43:00,084
I don't feel well.

1681
01:43:00,154 --> 01:43:02,520
I think I'm getting a cold.

1682
01:43:02,589 --> 01:43:05,524
Cordy, why don't you take
Mr. Duke into the parlor?

1683
01:43:10,130 --> 01:43:11,119
Yes, ma'am?

1684
01:43:11,198 --> 01:43:14,065
John, bring some more coffee
into the parlor, will you?

1685
01:43:14,134 --> 01:43:16,159
You little devil.

1686
01:43:17,337 --> 01:43:20,272
Decided to make
a holiday of it, did you?

1687
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:23,002
I told you he keeps alligators.

1688
01:43:23,076 --> 01:43:24,270
It's not that.

1689
01:43:24,344 --> 01:43:26,744
I mean, it's not just that.

1690
01:43:26,813 --> 01:43:29,646
Cordy, he scares me to death.

1691
01:43:29,716 --> 01:43:32,048
But that's the whole trouble.

1692
01:43:32,119 --> 01:43:35,020
You've got to stand up to him.

1693
01:43:35,088 --> 01:43:37,147
I think he'd punch me
in the nose.

1694
01:43:37,224 --> 01:43:38,555
Punch him back.

1695
01:43:38,625 --> 01:43:40,525
Or better still,
punch him first.

1696
01:43:40,594 --> 01:43:41,720
What?

1697
01:43:41,795 --> 01:43:44,662
When he comes in here,
you've got to talk up to him.

1698
01:43:44,731 --> 01:43:48,462
Whatever he says, you dive
right in and contradict him.

1699
01:43:48,535 --> 01:43:49,832
Even when he's right?

1700
01:43:49,903 --> 01:43:51,837
Especially when he's right.

1701
01:43:51,905 --> 01:43:53,372
Cordy, I couldn't do that.

1702
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:56,238
Angie, I want him to like you.

1703
01:43:56,310 --> 01:43:58,870
And I'm telling you
how to go about it.

1704
01:43:58,946 --> 01:44:00,470
Are you feeling better,
Mr. Duke?

1705
01:44:00,547 --> 01:44:01,571
Yes.
Thank you.

1706
01:44:01,648 --> 01:44:03,775
It was a little close in there.

1707
01:44:03,850 --> 01:44:06,546
Yes, in this cold weather
one has to be so careful.

1708
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:08,281
Going out of doors, coming in.

1709
01:44:08,355 --> 01:44:09,686
Cold weather's good for you.

1710
01:44:09,756 --> 01:44:12,350
It clears the lungs.
Puts the heart to work.

1711
01:44:13,227 --> 01:44:15,354
I like hot weather.

1712
01:44:16,530 --> 01:44:17,792
You do?

1713
01:44:17,864 --> 01:44:19,593
Yes, sir.
I do.

1714
01:44:19,666 --> 01:44:21,133
Well...

1715
01:44:21,902 --> 01:44:23,597
Now we know.

1716
01:44:25,305 --> 01:44:27,432
Over here, please, John.

1717
01:44:30,110 --> 01:44:33,876
Mr. Biddle, I understand
you're a real boxing enthusiast.

1718
01:44:33,947 --> 01:44:35,744
Well, yes.

1719
01:44:35,816 --> 01:44:37,443
Yes, for some years now, I...

1720
01:44:37,517 --> 01:44:38,916
I never could see much in it.

1721
01:44:38,986 --> 01:44:40,544
As a sport.

1722
01:44:41,922 --> 01:44:45,449
I mean, two men just standing
there hitting each other.

1723
01:44:45,525 --> 01:44:49,188
It doesn't seem to have
much subtlety to it.

1724
01:44:49,997 --> 01:44:52,022
- It doesn't?
- No, sir.

1725
01:44:57,237 --> 01:45:00,695
John, bring in the gloves.

1726
01:45:01,074 --> 01:45:02,666
The boxing gloves, sir?

1727
01:45:02,743 --> 01:45:04,802
Yes, the boxing gloves.

1728
01:45:04,878 --> 01:45:07,870
Anthony, what are
you thinking of?

1729
01:45:08,515 --> 01:45:11,348
I want to show Mr. Duke some
of the subtleties of the sport

1730
01:45:11,418 --> 01:45:13,079
and correct
his false impression.

1731
01:45:13,153 --> 01:45:15,246
John and I can box
a quick couple of rounds.

1732
01:45:15,322 --> 01:45:17,051
Me, Mr. Biddle?
Fightin' you, sir?

1733
01:45:17,124 --> 01:45:18,489
In my parlor?

1734
01:45:18,558 --> 01:45:19,855
Just a demonstration.

1735
01:45:19,926 --> 01:45:22,724
Mr. Duke, would you mind moving
that chair out of the way?

1736
01:45:22,796 --> 01:45:25,094
The medium gloves, John.

1737
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:27,927
Pardon me, Cordy.

1738
01:45:28,001 --> 01:45:30,902
Anthony, I really don't think
this is the time or the place.

1739
01:45:30,971 --> 01:45:33,565
We don't have to stand
on ceremonies with Mr. Duke.

1740
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:35,335
He's practically
a member of the family.

1741
01:45:35,409 --> 01:45:37,377
- Right, Mr. Duke?
- Right, sir.

1742
01:45:37,444 --> 01:45:39,674
As a matter of fact, sir,
I was just wondering.

1743
01:45:39,746 --> 01:45:41,805
Why can't I try it?

1744
01:45:42,949 --> 01:45:44,075
What's that?

1745
01:45:44,151 --> 01:45:46,176
Why can't I fight you?

1746
01:45:46,253 --> 01:45:48,414
Without knowing
what you're doing?

1747
01:45:48,488 --> 01:45:50,012
From what I've seen
of the sport,

1748
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:52,650
there can't be that much to it.

1749
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:55,355
- Well, Mr. Duke...
- Anthony.

1750
01:45:55,429 --> 01:45:57,260
I don't think so.

1751
01:45:59,499 --> 01:46:01,057
I thought this was one house

1752
01:46:01,134 --> 01:46:03,694
where a man could get
a fair fight.

1753
01:46:06,206 --> 01:46:09,107
John, give Mr. Duke your gloves.

1754
01:46:09,176 --> 01:46:10,541
Gladly, sir.

1755
01:46:10,610 --> 01:46:12,077
Allow me, Mr. Biddle.

1756
01:46:12,145 --> 01:46:14,443
Cordy, can you help me
with these?

1757
01:46:14,781 --> 01:46:16,646
I don't think
you have to go this far.

1758
01:46:16,717 --> 01:46:18,412
Please.

1759
01:46:18,485 --> 01:46:19,918
Okay.

1760
01:46:20,487 --> 01:46:22,682
There.
You keep time, John.

1761
01:46:24,791 --> 01:46:26,349
Cordelia, he wants to.

1762
01:46:26,426 --> 01:46:27,620
You heard him.

1763
01:46:27,694 --> 01:46:29,719
Anthony, I hope you know
what you're doing.

1764
01:46:29,796 --> 01:46:31,263
I'll be careful with him.

1765
01:46:31,331 --> 01:46:33,765
That isn't exactly what I meant.

1766
01:46:34,768 --> 01:46:36,099
Are we ready, gentlemen?

1767
01:46:36,169 --> 01:46:37,761
Yes.
You ready, Mr. Duke?

1768
01:46:37,838 --> 01:46:39,829
- Yes, sir.
- We'll see if we can't show you

1769
01:46:39,906 --> 01:46:42,431
there's more to boxing
than you think there is.

1770
01:46:42,509 --> 01:46:44,670
- All right, John.
- Time.

1771
01:46:47,614 --> 01:46:50,242
Never take your eye
off your opponent, Mr. Duke.

1772
01:46:51,952 --> 01:46:54,819
Mr. Duke, boxing is called
the art of self-defense

1773
01:46:54,888 --> 01:46:55,855
for good reason.

1774
01:46:55,922 --> 01:46:58,220
That means you're
supposed to protect yourself.

1775
01:47:00,427 --> 01:47:02,019
Your stomach.
Your chin.

1776
01:47:02,095 --> 01:47:03,619
Keep circling, Angie.

1777
01:47:03,697 --> 01:47:05,392
Keep circling.

1778
01:47:07,834 --> 01:47:08,766
You see, Mr. Duke?

1779
01:47:08,835 --> 01:47:11,269
If I'd been throwing hard
punches, you'd be in trouble.

1780
01:47:11,338 --> 01:47:12,600
Protect yourself.

1781
01:47:12,672 --> 01:47:14,833
Keep your chin tucked, Angie.

1782
01:47:15,342 --> 01:47:17,503
- My chin what?
- Tucked.

1783
01:47:19,179 --> 01:47:21,306
No, just keep it
behind your shoulder there

1784
01:47:21,381 --> 01:47:22,746
so you don't get hurt.

1785
01:47:23,116 --> 01:47:26,313
All right, now you throw some
punches at me, Mr. Duke.

1786
01:47:26,386 --> 01:47:28,081
Never lead with your right,
Mr. Duke.

1787
01:47:28,155 --> 01:47:30,589
You're open for a left hook.
See?

1788
01:47:31,224 --> 01:47:32,782
Throw another punch.

1789
01:47:33,260 --> 01:47:34,625
Now the stomach.
See?

1790
01:47:34,694 --> 01:47:36,218
You're not protecting yourself.

1791
01:47:36,296 --> 01:47:39,129
Little more subtle than
you thought, isn't it?

1792
01:47:41,368 --> 01:47:42,665
Hey.
Wait.

1793
01:47:42,736 --> 01:47:45,330
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Mr. Duke.

1794
01:47:45,405 --> 01:47:47,202
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1795
01:47:48,275 --> 01:47:51,073
Mr. Duke!
Wait a minute now.

1796
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:55,905
You see, Mr. Duke.

1797
01:47:57,851 --> 01:48:00,217
- Angie!
- You ran right into my glove.

1798
01:48:00,287 --> 01:48:01,447
Will you need the ice?

1799
01:48:01,521 --> 01:48:03,079
He's all right.
Aren't you, Mr. Duke?

1800
01:48:03,156 --> 01:48:04,623
Yes, sir.
Sure, I'm okay.

1801
01:48:04,691 --> 01:48:06,852
Well, I hope
you're not upset with me.

1802
01:48:06,927 --> 01:48:10,260
No. If I were upset,
I'd take care of you.

1803
01:48:11,998 --> 01:48:14,125
You'd take care of me?

1804
01:48:14,201 --> 01:48:15,259
That's right.

1805
01:48:15,335 --> 01:48:19,499
Well, now, I find myself
wondering about that.

1806
01:48:19,573 --> 01:48:22,804
- You do?
- Yes, indeed, I do.

1807
01:48:24,044 --> 01:48:26,569
Excuse me, John.

1808
01:48:26,646 --> 01:48:29,706
Sir, would you take your boxing
stance right here, please?

1809
01:48:29,783 --> 01:48:30,715
Angie.

1810
01:48:30,784 --> 01:48:33,412
Cordy, would you stand
right over here?

1811
01:48:34,621 --> 01:48:35,713
Now what?

1812
01:48:42,729 --> 01:48:44,196
Papa!

1813
01:48:44,264 --> 01:48:47,358
Say, that's a pretty good trick.

1814
01:48:47,434 --> 01:48:49,732
Will you be needing
the ice, sir?

1815
01:48:49,803 --> 01:48:51,270
Anthony, you all right?

1816
01:48:51,338 --> 01:48:52,498
Of course I'm all right.

1817
01:48:52,572 --> 01:48:54,699
He caught me unawares,
that's all.

1818
01:48:54,774 --> 01:48:56,765
Would you care to
try it again, sir?

1819
01:48:56,843 --> 01:48:57,867
Awares?

1820
01:48:57,944 --> 01:48:59,036
Confound it, boy.

1821
01:48:59,112 --> 01:49:01,137
I've had my share of
roughhouse fighting.

1822
01:49:01,214 --> 01:49:03,148
Couldn't all this wait
for another time?

1823
01:49:03,216 --> 01:49:04,774
The coffee's getting quite cold.

1824
01:49:04,851 --> 01:49:06,045
Don't worry, Mrs. Biddle.

1825
01:49:06,119 --> 01:49:07,313
No one will get hurt.

1826
01:49:07,387 --> 01:49:08,786
At least I won't.

1827
01:49:08,855 --> 01:49:10,413
What do you want to do?
Wrestle?

1828
01:49:10,490 --> 01:49:11,821
It's called jujitsu, sir.

1829
01:49:11,892 --> 01:49:14,861
It's a little
like wrestling, yes.

1830
01:49:16,563 --> 01:49:17,825
Angie, please.

1831
01:49:17,898 --> 01:49:19,160
Have you gone crazy?

1832
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:20,927
Yes, I think I have, Cordy.

1833
01:49:21,001 --> 01:49:23,299
And I feel right at home.

1834
01:49:41,454 --> 01:49:43,251
Mr. Duke, are you all right?

1835
01:49:43,323 --> 01:49:44,483
Is he all right?

1836
01:49:44,558 --> 01:49:46,219
I hope I didn't hurt you, sir.

1837
01:49:46,293 --> 01:49:47,726
Nothing that won't wear off.

1838
01:49:47,794 --> 01:49:49,591
That's a grand style
of fighting, sir.

1839
01:49:49,663 --> 01:49:51,062
I'd like to learn it meself.

1840
01:49:51,131 --> 01:49:53,463
I got a feeling it might
come in handy someday.

1841
01:49:53,533 --> 01:49:55,023
We've all got to learn it.

1842
01:49:55,101 --> 01:49:57,865
Every last man
in the Philadelphia Corps.

1843
01:49:57,938 --> 01:50:00,463
Mr. Duke, I want to thank you.

1844
01:50:00,540 --> 01:50:01,837
That's a remarkable thing.

1845
01:50:01,908 --> 01:50:03,239
It could mean the difference

1846
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:05,642
between life and death
in hand-to-hand combat.

1847
01:50:05,712 --> 01:50:07,441
You will teach it to me,
won't you?

1848
01:50:07,514 --> 01:50:08,776
Yes, of course, sir.

1849
01:50:08,848 --> 01:50:12,284
And then, one of these days,
we'll have a return match.

1850
01:50:13,286 --> 01:50:15,117
Well, Cordelia,
these two young people

1851
01:50:15,188 --> 01:50:16,815
haven't been alone all evening.

1852
01:50:16,890 --> 01:50:18,915
Yes, well, it's time
to say good night.

1853
01:50:18,992 --> 01:50:21,552
It's been so nice having you,
Mr. Duke.

1854
01:50:21,628 --> 01:50:23,562
- May I call you Angie?
- Please.

1855
01:50:23,630 --> 01:50:25,222
Well, then, good night, Angie.

1856
01:50:25,298 --> 01:50:27,357
And we'll see you very soon.

1857
01:50:27,434 --> 01:50:28,992
Good night, dear.

1858
01:50:31,104 --> 01:50:33,095
- Good night, Mr. Duke.
- Good night, sir.

1859
01:50:33,173 --> 01:50:34,504
- Jujitsu, is it?
- Yes, sir.

1860
01:50:34,574 --> 01:50:36,269
By George, it's remarkable.

1861
01:50:36,343 --> 01:50:37,901
Good night, Cordy.

1862
01:50:40,513 --> 01:50:41,502
Papa.

1863
01:50:42,816 --> 01:50:44,511
Papa.

1864
01:50:44,584 --> 01:50:45,778
Thank you.

1865
01:50:45,852 --> 01:50:46,910
Thank me for what?

1866
01:50:46,987 --> 01:50:48,784
He could've killed me.

1867
01:50:48,855 --> 01:50:50,550
Can we announce
our engagement soon?

1868
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:52,649
- Yes, of course.
- Why not?

1869
01:50:52,726 --> 01:50:55,126
And can I go to New York
and meet Angie's family?

1870
01:50:55,195 --> 01:50:55,957
Definitely.

1871
01:50:56,029 --> 01:50:58,793
The Biddles and the Dukes will
have to get to know each other.

1872
01:50:58,865 --> 01:51:00,958
The sooner, the better.

1873
01:51:26,326 --> 01:51:28,260
Angier!

1874
01:51:29,929 --> 01:51:32,864
Angier, you sly boy.

1875
01:51:32,932 --> 01:51:35,492
Whatever have you gone and done?

1876
01:51:35,568 --> 01:51:37,729
Mother, I'd like you
to meet Cordelia.

1877
01:51:37,804 --> 01:51:40,705
So this is the girl.

1878
01:51:40,774 --> 01:51:45,438
The one you have picked out of
all the world to be yours alone.

1879
01:51:45,512 --> 01:51:47,776
My goodness.

1880
01:51:47,847 --> 01:51:50,247
Why, I nearly fainted
when I got your call.

1881
01:51:50,316 --> 01:51:52,716
Engaged.
Imagine that.

1882
01:51:52,786 --> 01:51:56,119
And to a girl from Philadelphia.

1883
01:51:56,690 --> 01:51:58,487
We're going to have
a busy schedule.

1884
01:51:58,558 --> 01:52:00,651
Mother, I hope
you haven't told people.

1885
01:52:00,727 --> 01:52:03,753
- Cordy and I thought...
- Only a select few.

1886
01:52:03,830 --> 01:52:06,094
Come along, Cordelia, dear.

1887
01:52:06,833 --> 01:52:11,236
Everyone who knows
is frantic to entertain you.

1888
01:52:12,739 --> 01:52:16,402
Lorraine Mansfield
called three times.

1889
01:53:09,395 --> 01:53:10,919
Angie.

1890
01:53:14,033 --> 01:53:15,625
I thought you'd never come.

1891
01:53:15,702 --> 01:53:19,194
I know. I got stuck
with my cousin Margaret.

1892
01:53:19,272 --> 01:53:21,240
I'm freezing.

1893
01:53:21,307 --> 01:53:23,275
I'll fix that.

1894
01:53:27,947 --> 01:53:29,346
Angier?

1895
01:53:29,415 --> 01:53:30,814
Are you out here?

1896
01:53:30,884 --> 01:53:32,715
Oh, so you are.

1897
01:53:32,786 --> 01:53:34,378
Behind a bush.

1898
01:53:34,454 --> 01:53:36,422
We came out for
a little fresh air, Mother.

1899
01:53:36,489 --> 01:53:37,979
The last thing we need, Angier,

1900
01:53:38,057 --> 01:53:39,684
is for you to come down
with a cold.

1901
01:53:39,759 --> 01:53:40,953
We'll be right in, Mother.

1902
01:53:41,027 --> 01:53:44,394
Well, I'd appreciate it.
People are asking for you.

1903
01:54:22,335 --> 01:54:24,064
Excuse me.

1904
01:54:34,614 --> 01:54:35,546
Papa!

1905
01:54:35,615 --> 01:54:36,980
Cordy!

1906
01:54:38,284 --> 01:54:40,047
Let me look at you.

1907
01:54:40,119 --> 01:54:43,054
You're going to end up a real
beauty if you're not careful.

1908
01:54:43,122 --> 01:54:45,022
Oh, Papa.

1909
01:54:45,091 --> 01:54:46,854
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

1910
01:54:46,926 --> 01:54:48,689
Oh, it's good to see you,
sweetheart.

1911
01:54:48,761 --> 01:54:50,592
Come over here and sit down.

1912
01:54:51,731 --> 01:54:52,925
Now, tell me.

1913
01:54:52,999 --> 01:54:54,762
How do you like the big city?

1914
01:54:54,834 --> 01:54:56,301
Oh, fine.

1915
01:54:56,369 --> 01:54:58,303
There's always
something going on.

1916
01:54:58,371 --> 01:55:00,305
You get along
with the Dukes all right?

1917
01:55:00,373 --> 01:55:02,432
Yes, of course.
Perfectly.

1918
01:55:02,508 --> 01:55:03,770
Cordy?

1919
01:55:03,843 --> 01:55:05,071
Mr. Biddle!

1920
01:55:05,144 --> 01:55:06,702
- How are you, son?
- Just fine, sir.

1921
01:55:06,779 --> 01:55:09,475
Keeping that jujitsu
in good practice?

1922
01:55:09,549 --> 01:55:11,278
I've been doing
a little practicing myself.

1923
01:55:11,351 --> 01:55:12,340
Angier!

1924
01:55:12,418 --> 01:55:13,350
Oh, Mother.

1925
01:55:13,419 --> 01:55:14,784
Oh.

1926
01:55:14,854 --> 01:55:17,823
Mother, may I introduce
Mr. Biddle?

1927
01:55:17,891 --> 01:55:19,188
Oh!

1928
01:55:19,259 --> 01:55:21,625
Oh, well,
this is a happy surprise.

1929
01:55:21,694 --> 01:55:23,889
I'm very pleased to
meet you, Mrs. Duke.

1930
01:55:23,963 --> 01:55:25,487
Is it quite safe?

1931
01:55:25,565 --> 01:55:27,795
A beautiful woman has
always been safe with me.

1932
01:55:27,867 --> 01:55:30,495
I doubt that, Mr. Biddle.

1933
01:55:30,570 --> 01:55:34,097
Mrs. Duke, Mrs. Biddle and I
are sorry we've had to refuse

1934
01:55:34,173 --> 01:55:35,868
the kind invitations
we've received.

1935
01:55:35,942 --> 01:55:39,070
But, well, it seems this war
has been taking up all my time.

1936
01:55:39,145 --> 01:55:41,136
We've all been disappointed,
naturally.

1937
01:55:41,214 --> 01:55:43,148
What finally brought you
to New York?

1938
01:55:43,216 --> 01:55:44,877
- I'm on tour.
- Tour?

1939
01:55:44,951 --> 01:55:46,111
With a squad of Marines.

1940
01:55:46,185 --> 01:55:49,211
We demonstrate
bayonet techniques.

1941
01:55:49,289 --> 01:55:50,779
In auditoriums, theaters.

1942
01:55:50,857 --> 01:55:52,347
Anywhere we can find the space.

1943
01:55:52,425 --> 01:55:53,983
Whatever for?

1944
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:55,618
It's a recruiting device.

1945
01:55:55,695 --> 01:55:58,789
Stirs the blood to see these men
locked in hand-to-hand combat.

1946
01:55:58,865 --> 01:56:00,730
I'm sure it must.

1947
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:04,395
We're just passing through
New York on our way to Boston.

1948
01:56:04,470 --> 01:56:06,529
I couldn't resist
stopping off between trains

1949
01:56:06,606 --> 01:56:08,130
to see my little girl.

1950
01:56:08,207 --> 01:56:10,437
It's been a treat for all of us.

1951
01:56:10,510 --> 01:56:12,535
You'll join our party,
of course?

1952
01:56:12,612 --> 01:56:16,070
I'm afraid I can't, Mrs. Duke.
I have a 10:00 train to catch.

1953
01:56:16,149 --> 01:56:18,276
Well, I'll go with you
to the station.

1954
01:56:18,351 --> 01:56:20,683
Good, Cordy.
I'd like that.

1955
01:56:20,753 --> 01:56:22,914
If you'll excuse her
for a while, Mrs. Duke.

1956
01:56:22,989 --> 01:56:24,047
But of course.

1957
01:56:24,123 --> 01:56:25,818
Excuse me.
I'll get my wrap.

1958
01:56:25,892 --> 01:56:27,120
I can get you a cab, sir.

1959
01:56:27,193 --> 01:56:28,524
Oh, thank you.

1960
01:56:34,467 --> 01:56:38,062
Well, it won't be long now.

1961
01:56:39,305 --> 01:56:41,034
The wedding in Philadelphia.

1962
01:56:41,107 --> 01:56:44,270
No, no.
It won't be long.

1963
01:56:46,813 --> 01:56:49,646
And how do you like it?

1964
01:56:50,216 --> 01:56:52,116
They make a handsome couple.

1965
01:56:53,586 --> 01:56:56,851
Oh, you don't like it
any better than I do.

1966
01:56:57,857 --> 01:57:00,189
It takes getting used to.

1967
01:57:02,228 --> 01:57:05,686
Wasn't too long ago that Angie
wouldn't pick a suit of clothes

1968
01:57:05,765 --> 01:57:07,699
without asking my opinion.

1969
01:57:07,767 --> 01:57:10,429
Now he goes off to Lakewood
for a weekend

1970
01:57:10,503 --> 01:57:14,496
and picks someone to spend
the rest of his life with.

1971
01:57:22,115 --> 01:57:23,844
Yes.

1972
01:57:24,650 --> 01:57:27,278
Well, Mrs. Duke,
I want to thank you

1973
01:57:27,353 --> 01:57:29,321
for the generous way
you've entertained my daughter.

1974
01:57:29,389 --> 01:57:32,381
It's my pleasure, Mr. Biddle.
I love spectacle.

1975
01:57:32,458 --> 01:57:33,618
Well, I'm not so sure

1976
01:57:33,693 --> 01:57:35,661
how spectacular
you'll find Philadelphia.

1977
01:57:35,728 --> 01:57:37,889
But we'll certainly do our best.

1978
01:57:37,964 --> 01:57:39,955
I'm sure you will.

1979
01:57:40,033 --> 01:57:41,295
Good night.

1980
01:57:43,736 --> 01:57:45,670
Good night.

1981
01:57:53,146 --> 01:57:55,671
I think I might be coming home
next week.

1982
01:57:55,748 --> 01:57:57,306
Oh?

1983
01:57:57,383 --> 01:58:00,409
But I thought you were going to
stay till the end of the month.

1984
01:58:00,486 --> 01:58:03,717
Well, I'm awfully tired.

1985
01:58:04,824 --> 01:58:06,815
You're sure there's
nothing wrong?

1986
01:58:06,893 --> 01:58:09,327
Of course I'm sure.

1987
01:58:09,862 --> 01:58:14,458
I just want to curl up
in my own bed in my own room

1988
01:58:14,534 --> 01:58:18,493
and stay there for about a week.

1989
01:58:21,841 --> 01:58:24,332
They're not like us, Papa.

1990
01:58:33,152 --> 01:58:36,588
<i>? When a man has a daughter?</i>

1991
01:58:37,390 --> 01:58:40,382
<i>? She's always in his heart?</i>

1992
01:58:41,594 --> 01:58:47,226
<i>? Happiness is part
of all his prayers?</i>

1993
01:58:49,135 --> 01:58:52,434
<i>? When a man has a daughter?</i>

1994
01:58:53,806 --> 01:58:57,071
<i>? He wants her life to be?</i>

1995
01:58:57,477 --> 01:59:04,007
<i>? As smooth as satin ribbons
that she wears?</i>

1996
01:59:05,685 --> 01:59:08,210
<i>? What's wrong with that??</i>

1997
01:59:09,856 --> 01:59:12,620
<i>? What's wrong with that??</i>

1998
01:59:14,360 --> 01:59:18,694
<i>? I want her home,
where she's free of care?</i>

1999
01:59:19,565 --> 01:59:24,468
<i>? I miss her footsteps
on the stairs?</i>

2000
01:59:25,304 --> 01:59:27,864
<i>? What's wrong with that??</i>

2001
02:00:25,298 --> 02:00:26,765
Mrs. Duke?

2002
02:00:26,832 --> 02:00:28,493
Yes?

2003
02:00:28,568 --> 02:00:30,399
I found some more people
for you to meet.

2004
02:00:30,469 --> 02:00:31,731
How delightful.

2005
02:00:31,804 --> 02:00:34,500
Gentlemen, this is Cordy's
future mother-in-law.

2006
02:00:34,574 --> 02:00:36,735
Mrs. Duke,
may I present Joe Turner?

2007
02:00:36,809 --> 02:00:39,175
Glad to know you, Mrs. Duke.

2008
02:00:39,612 --> 02:00:42,342
Joe is one of the mainstays
in my Bible classes.

2009
02:00:42,415 --> 02:00:45,714
You'd never believe he was a bum
and a drunk when I found him.

2010
02:00:45,785 --> 02:00:47,480
Mr. Biddle sure saved me,
all right.

2011
02:00:47,553 --> 02:00:49,646
- He's tops on my list.
- I'm sure.

2012
02:00:49,722 --> 02:00:52,486
You're marrying into
a fine family.

2013
02:00:52,558 --> 02:00:55,118
Yes.
We'll try to be deserving.

2014
02:00:55,194 --> 02:00:56,661
And this is Bill O'Brien.

2015
02:00:56,729 --> 02:00:58,856
Bill once fought
for the heavyweight title.

2016
02:00:58,931 --> 02:01:01,525
If I'd have lasted that
third round, I'd have got him.

2017
02:01:01,601 --> 02:01:04,331
I was just gettin' onto
his tricks.

2018
02:01:04,403 --> 02:01:06,633
It's really something
to fight for the title.

2019
02:01:07,273 --> 02:01:08,740
Oh, there's Madame LaFarge.

2020
02:01:08,808 --> 02:01:11,072
Finest voice teacher
in Philadelphia.

2021
02:01:11,644 --> 02:01:13,373
Do you like opera, Mrs. Duke?

2022
02:01:13,446 --> 02:01:14,708
Sometimes.

2023
02:01:14,780 --> 02:01:17,340
Madame LaFarge sings
a mean "Carmen."

2024
02:01:17,416 --> 02:01:18,815
Would you excuse me?

2025
02:01:20,253 --> 02:01:21,914
Nice party, huh, Mrs. Duke?

2026
02:01:21,988 --> 02:01:23,922
Oh, yes.
Colorful.

2027
02:01:23,990 --> 02:01:27,084
We can't let New York
outclass Philadelphia.

2028
02:01:27,159 --> 02:01:29,127
Thanks, John.

2029
02:01:29,729 --> 02:01:33,392
Say, I could use another slug
of that champagne punch.

2030
02:01:33,466 --> 02:01:35,161
How about you, Mrs. Duke?

2031
02:01:35,234 --> 02:01:36,462
Oh, no, thank you.

2032
02:01:36,535 --> 02:01:40,301
I haven't finished the slug
I already have.

2033
02:02:29,655 --> 02:02:30,952
Tell me.

2034
02:02:31,023 --> 02:02:34,857
Does Mr. Biddle often
present himself in concert?

2035
02:02:34,927 --> 02:02:36,918
From time to time, ma'am.

2036
02:02:36,996 --> 02:02:39,760
He sang once at a real opera.

2037
02:02:39,832 --> 02:02:41,697
Dressed up like a clown, he was.

2038
02:02:41,767 --> 02:02:44,133
And sang out loud and clear
through the whole thing.

2039
02:02:44,203 --> 02:02:49,231
It sounds as though he were
appropriately costumed.

2040
02:02:50,476 --> 02:02:53,741
Papa did "Pagliacci" with
the Manhattan Opera Company.

2041
02:02:53,813 --> 02:02:55,110
You're joking.

2042
02:02:55,181 --> 02:02:57,274
At least he feels like singing.

2043
02:02:57,350 --> 02:02:58,783
Well, so do I sometimes.

2044
02:02:58,851 --> 02:03:01,445
But I keep it to myself.

2045
02:03:02,021 --> 02:03:04,285
Aren't you having
anything to eat?

2046
02:03:04,357 --> 02:03:07,292
You might like the sour pickles.

2047
02:03:26,612 --> 02:03:29,274
Oh, shut up.

2048
02:03:38,391 --> 02:03:39,790
Hi.

2049
02:03:40,926 --> 02:03:42,257
You're crying.

2050
02:03:42,328 --> 02:03:43,886
You're late.

2051
02:03:44,497 --> 02:03:46,761
Is that why you're crying?

2052
02:03:47,466 --> 02:03:48,933
No.

2053
02:03:49,001 --> 02:03:51,162
I'm crying because...

2054
02:03:51,937 --> 02:03:53,996
Oh, I don't know why.

2055
02:03:54,473 --> 02:03:57,135
Cordy, there has to be a reason.

2056
02:03:58,944 --> 02:04:00,411
Angie.

2057
02:04:02,381 --> 02:04:05,748
We're gonna be married
in just three days.

2058
02:04:06,252 --> 02:04:07,810
I know.

2059
02:04:08,821 --> 02:04:10,584
I'm afraid.

2060
02:04:12,124 --> 02:04:15,355
Ever since we got engaged,
I never see you alone.

2061
02:04:15,428 --> 02:04:17,055
We never talk.
We never touch.

2062
02:04:17,129 --> 02:04:20,121
I seem like a total stranger
to you, right?

2063
02:04:20,199 --> 02:04:21,632
You feel it, too?

2064
02:04:21,700 --> 02:04:24,294
Yes, Cordy.
That's why I was late today.

2065
02:04:24,370 --> 02:04:26,964
I was so nervous and worried
about everything,

2066
02:04:27,039 --> 02:04:29,234
I decided to take a walk
to clear my mind.

2067
02:04:29,308 --> 02:04:31,105
To get things straight.

2068
02:04:31,177 --> 02:04:34,908
I walked clear
to the Delaware River.

2069
02:04:35,448 --> 02:04:38,178
Oh, Angie.

2070
02:04:40,686 --> 02:04:43,052
We can't let this happen.

2071
02:04:43,923 --> 02:04:47,484
Everything will be all right
once we get away from parties

2072
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:52,862
and our families
and we're on our way to Detroit.

2073
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:55,992
What is it?

2074
02:04:56,836 --> 02:04:58,326
- Hold it!
- Cordy.

2075
02:05:00,372 --> 02:05:02,863
Just a minute, Mr. Duke.
I'd like another picture.

2076
02:05:02,942 --> 02:05:03,931
Later.

2077
02:05:09,281 --> 02:05:11,374
Is something wrong?

2078
02:05:12,651 --> 02:05:16,678
Cordy, there's something I
have to tell you about Detroit.

2079
02:05:17,423 --> 02:05:18,856
Yes?

2080
02:05:19,658 --> 02:05:23,253
Well, I've been giving it
some thought.

2081
02:05:23,329 --> 02:05:24,921
And I've come
to the conclusion...

2082
02:05:24,997 --> 02:05:27,625
Angier!
Where have you been?

2083
02:05:27,700 --> 02:05:31,158
I feel like Daniel
in the lions' den.

2084
02:05:33,138 --> 02:05:34,571
Excuse me.

2085
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:37,939
I shouldn't stay away
from my guests too long.

2086
02:05:43,182 --> 02:05:46,811
Mother, why do you have to
act this way?

2087
02:05:46,886 --> 02:05:48,353
Oh, forgive me.

2088
02:05:48,420 --> 02:05:50,251
I don't believe it is
my behavior

2089
02:05:50,322 --> 02:05:51,755
that is questionable here.

2090
02:05:51,824 --> 02:05:53,849
What about
those wedding invitations?

2091
02:05:53,926 --> 02:05:54,984
I don't know yet.

2092
02:05:55,060 --> 02:05:56,823
And you promised
not to mention it.

2093
02:05:56,896 --> 02:05:58,454
But we have to know.

2094
02:05:58,531 --> 02:06:02,627
Mother, this is
a very difficult time for me.

2095
02:06:02,701 --> 02:06:04,726
And I wish you'd help me out
by going along

2096
02:06:04,803 --> 02:06:07,101
with the Biddles' way
of doing things.

2097
02:06:07,172 --> 02:06:09,970
After all, this is their house.

2098
02:06:10,042 --> 02:06:13,637
Angier, are you snapping at me?

2099
02:06:13,712 --> 02:06:16,977
Why, that's not like you.

2100
02:06:17,049 --> 02:06:18,778
Oh, never mind.

2101
02:06:18,851 --> 02:06:20,375
We'll help each other.

2102
02:06:20,452 --> 02:06:22,818
I promise I will do
everything I can

2103
02:06:22,888 --> 02:06:24,879
to keep the atmosphere peaceful.

2104
02:06:24,957 --> 02:06:26,254
Thank you, Mother.

2105
02:06:26,325 --> 02:06:28,418
And when we are out
of all this madness

2106
02:06:28,494 --> 02:06:30,325
and you're on your way
to the Ozarks...

2107
02:06:30,396 --> 02:06:33,388
Mother, I warned you
not to talk about that.

2108
02:06:33,465 --> 02:06:36,127
Oh, yes.
So you did.

2109
02:06:36,201 --> 02:06:39,170
Tell me. Is there anything
I can talk about?

2110
02:06:39,238 --> 02:06:41,798
Is there no one to answer
the door?

2111
02:06:45,411 --> 02:06:47,174
Where are the servants?

2112
02:06:47,246 --> 02:06:48,338
They're out there.

2113
02:06:48,414 --> 02:06:50,746
Fighting for their lives.

2114
02:06:50,816 --> 02:06:53,546
Young man, tell Mr. Biddle
I'm waiting in the parlor.

2115
02:06:53,619 --> 02:06:56,782
I have no intention
of going out into that mob.

2116
02:06:58,123 --> 02:06:59,784
Yes, ma'am.

2117
02:07:04,063 --> 02:07:06,224
Do you know
who that young man is?

2118
02:07:06,298 --> 02:07:08,459
That is Angier Duke.

2119
02:07:10,202 --> 02:07:12,500
There are those who would
consider the heir

2120
02:07:12,571 --> 02:07:17,702
to a multimillion-dollar fortune
improper choice for errand boy.

2121
02:07:17,776 --> 02:07:20,939
And there are those sufficiently
accustomed to wealth

2122
02:07:21,013 --> 02:07:23,607
that the only thing to be
considered in such a choice

2123
02:07:23,682 --> 02:07:27,311
is how well will the young man
perform the errand.

2124
02:07:27,386 --> 02:07:29,183
Good afternoon, Mrs. Drexel.

2125
02:07:29,254 --> 02:07:31,722
But I will have a closer look
when he comes back.

2126
02:07:31,790 --> 02:07:33,155
He must be quite something

2127
02:07:33,225 --> 02:07:35,318
if Cordy can spend a month
in New York

2128
02:07:35,394 --> 02:07:36,827
and still want to marry him.

2129
02:07:36,895 --> 02:07:39,125
If you ladies will make
yourselves comfortable,

2130
02:07:39,198 --> 02:07:41,689
I'll fetch
some nice refreshments.

2131
02:07:42,034 --> 02:07:44,127
There are those
who consider New York

2132
02:07:44,203 --> 02:07:46,967
the only true city
in the country.

2133
02:07:47,039 --> 02:07:49,337
And there are those
who wear bibs when they eat.

2134
02:07:49,408 --> 02:07:52,434
But generally speaking, they
are not persons of influence.

2135
02:07:52,511 --> 02:07:54,809
- Indeed.
- Indeed.

2136
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:58,816
Champagne punch and some darling
little sandwiches.

2137
02:08:02,988 --> 02:08:06,014
<i>? There are those
whose social standing?</i>

2138
02:08:06,091 --> 02:08:09,424
<i>? Is constantly demanding?</i>

2139
02:08:09,495 --> 02:08:14,899
<i>? Every single thing we do,
the public knows?</i>

2140
02:08:16,168 --> 02:08:19,296
<i>? Then there is
a lower strata?</i>

2141
02:08:19,371 --> 02:08:23,000
<i>? Where propriety
doesn't matter?</i>

2142
02:08:23,075 --> 02:08:25,441
<i>? I suppose?</i>

2143
02:08:25,511 --> 02:08:27,001
<i>? There are those?</i>

2144
02:08:27,079 --> 02:08:29,946
<i>? There are those?</i>

2145
02:08:32,117 --> 02:08:35,609
<i>? There are those
to whom position?</i>

2146
02:08:35,688 --> 02:08:39,124
<i>? Is a natural-born condition?</i>

2147
02:08:39,191 --> 02:08:44,925
<i>? To be worn with ease
like comfortable old clothes?</i>

2148
02:08:45,831 --> 02:08:49,426
<i>? Though the nouveau riche
deny it?</i>

2149
02:08:49,501 --> 02:08:53,460
<i>? All their money
cannot buy it?</i>

2150
02:08:53,539 --> 02:08:55,939
<i>? Class will out?</i>

2151
02:08:56,008 --> 02:08:57,339
Goodness knows.

2152
02:08:57,409 --> 02:08:59,468
<i>? But there are those?</i>

2153
02:08:59,545 --> 02:09:01,877
Watercress on toast, ma'am?

2154
02:09:01,947 --> 02:09:05,974
<i>? There are those who grace
the pages of the Blue Book?</i>

2155
02:09:06,051 --> 02:09:07,313
Never heard of it.

2156
02:09:07,386 --> 02:09:08,648
Is it a new book?

2157
02:09:08,721 --> 02:09:11,849
Simply anyone who is anyone
is listed.

2158
02:09:11,924 --> 02:09:15,655
Oh. You mean the New York
telephone directory?

2159
02:09:15,728 --> 02:09:17,923
Hardly.

2160
02:09:18,997 --> 02:09:22,524
There are those whose names
predate the Constitution.

2161
02:09:22,601 --> 02:09:26,332
Yes, and some of them
opposed the Revolution.

2162
02:09:26,405 --> 02:09:27,667
Conservative.

2163
02:09:27,740 --> 02:09:29,230
Reactionary.

2164
02:09:29,308 --> 02:09:31,640
Cream cheese and cucumber?

2165
02:09:32,277 --> 02:09:38,273
<i>? Philadelphia is the cradle
of liberty?</i>

2166
02:09:38,350 --> 02:09:44,812
<i>? Slumbering like an aging page
of history?</i>

2167
02:09:44,890 --> 02:09:46,323
Chopped liver?

2168
02:09:46,391 --> 02:09:50,054
<i>? There are those
who flaunt prosperity?</i>

2169
02:09:50,129 --> 02:09:53,428
<i>? There are those
who flaunt austerity?</i>

2170
02:09:53,499 --> 02:09:58,801
<i>? Posing cozy
on their rosy status quos?</i>

2171
02:09:58,871 --> 02:10:01,305
Poison dart?
I mean, raisin tart?

2172
02:10:01,373 --> 02:10:04,900
<i>? There are those
quite influential?</i>

2173
02:10:04,977 --> 02:10:09,846
<i>? There are those
inconsequential?</i>

2174
02:10:09,915 --> 02:10:11,507
<i>? There are those?</i>

2175
02:10:11,583 --> 02:10:13,244
<i>? There are those?</i>

2176
02:10:13,318 --> 02:10:14,649
<i>? There are those?</i>

2177
02:10:14,720 --> 02:10:16,153
<i>? There are those?</i>

2178
02:10:16,221 --> 02:10:18,280
<i>? There are those?</i>

2179
02:10:22,628 --> 02:10:25,426
- I suppose.
- I suppose.

2180
02:10:31,136 --> 02:10:33,696
- There are those.
- There are those.

2181
02:10:36,842 --> 02:10:39,276
Well, Mrs. Duke,
I see you've met Aunt Mary.

2182
02:10:39,344 --> 02:10:40,811
Good afternoon, Aunt Mary.

2183
02:10:40,879 --> 02:10:43,109
Aunt Mary, I was looking for you
in the garden.

2184
02:10:43,182 --> 02:10:44,114
Not in that mob.

2185
02:10:44,183 --> 02:10:45,377
Hello, Aunt Mary.

2186
02:10:45,450 --> 02:10:46,382
Cordy.

2187
02:10:46,451 --> 02:10:48,783
Aunt Mary, this is Angie.

2188
02:10:48,854 --> 02:10:49,821
They've met.

2189
02:10:49,888 --> 02:10:53,415
Mrs. Drexel, I would like to
ask you a question or two

2190
02:10:53,492 --> 02:10:57,189
about how weddings are managed
by proper Philadelphians.

2191
02:10:57,262 --> 02:10:58,627
Mother, you promised.

2192
02:10:58,697 --> 02:11:01,495
What about the way weddings
are managed by Philadelphians?

2193
02:11:01,567 --> 02:11:02,966
Would anyone like a sandwich?

2194
02:11:03,035 --> 02:11:04,696
No.
No, thank you, John.

2195
02:11:04,770 --> 02:11:06,362
Is something wrong, Mrs. Duke?

2196
02:11:06,438 --> 02:11:08,599
Something is decidedly wrong.

2197
02:11:08,674 --> 02:11:09,834
I'll have a sandwich.

2198
02:11:09,908 --> 02:11:11,432
Let's all have a sandwich.

2199
02:11:11,510 --> 02:11:12,704
What about the wedding?

2200
02:11:12,778 --> 02:11:15,406
They really look delicious.
Won't you have one, Mother?

2201
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:16,811
I've already had one.

2202
02:11:16,882 --> 02:11:18,747
What about the wedding,
blast it?

2203
02:11:18,817 --> 02:11:21,479
I would like to know,
Mr. Biddle,

2204
02:11:21,553 --> 02:11:24,215
why the Dukes have not received
invitations.

2205
02:11:24,289 --> 02:11:25,517
As I understand it,

2206
02:11:25,591 --> 02:11:29,357
the Drexels and the Biddles
are coming by the thousands.

2207
02:11:29,428 --> 02:11:31,953
It is customary
in most societies

2208
02:11:32,030 --> 02:11:34,726
to invite the family
of the groom as well.

2209
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:37,963
But there was a separate box
of Duke invitations.

2210
02:11:38,036 --> 02:11:40,129
Yes.
Yes, I remember that.

2211
02:11:40,205 --> 02:11:42,537
Could something have
gone wrong at the post office?

2212
02:11:42,608 --> 02:11:44,542
John and I took them in
ourselves.

2213
02:11:44,610 --> 02:11:46,077
- John?
- Sir.

2214
02:11:46,144 --> 02:11:47,634
See if you can
find out anything.

2215
02:11:47,713 --> 02:11:49,237
Yes, sir.

2216
02:11:49,314 --> 02:11:51,282
I'm sure there's
some simple explanation.

2217
02:11:51,350 --> 02:11:53,648
We'll certainly
take care of it, Mrs. Duke.

2218
02:11:53,719 --> 02:11:55,880
These little things happen.

2219
02:11:55,954 --> 02:11:57,854
Little things?

2220
02:11:57,923 --> 02:12:01,188
How would you feel if the
Drexels had not been invited?

2221
02:12:01,260 --> 02:12:02,750
They'd come anyhow.

2222
02:12:02,828 --> 02:12:04,193
They're relatives.

2223
02:12:04,263 --> 02:12:07,824
It may surprise you to know
that the laws of kinship operate

2224
02:12:07,900 --> 02:12:10,460
in New York
and in North Carolina.

2225
02:12:10,535 --> 02:12:12,765
Only one thing surprises me,
Mrs. Duke.

2226
02:12:12,838 --> 02:12:15,398
Wait a minute.
If you could just...

2227
02:12:17,009 --> 02:12:17,941
Stop it!

2228
02:12:18,010 --> 02:12:19,568
All of you!

2229
02:12:19,645 --> 02:12:20,873
Duke pride.

2230
02:12:20,946 --> 02:12:21,913
Drexel pride.

2231
02:12:21,980 --> 02:12:23,208
Biddle pride.

2232
02:12:23,282 --> 02:12:24,943
Philadelphia versus New York.

2233
02:12:25,017 --> 02:12:27,383
I'm sick to death of it.

2234
02:12:27,452 --> 02:12:29,283
Angie and I
have been shoved aside

2235
02:12:29,354 --> 02:12:31,652
while everyone is busy
turning our wedding

2236
02:12:31,723 --> 02:12:33,020
into the biggest production

2237
02:12:33,091 --> 02:12:35,582
and the biggest fight
in history.

2238
02:12:35,661 --> 02:12:36,958
It isn't fair.

2239
02:12:37,029 --> 02:12:39,293
And I'm not going to let it
go on this way

2240
02:12:39,364 --> 02:12:41,798
if Angie and I have to elope!

2241
02:12:41,867 --> 02:12:42,799
Elope?

2242
02:12:42,868 --> 02:12:44,893
And make us all look like fools?

2243
02:12:44,970 --> 02:12:48,030
At this moment, Mrs. Duke,
I don't care what you look like.

2244
02:12:48,106 --> 02:12:49,573
Cordy.

2245
02:12:50,142 --> 02:12:53,578
Angier, you had better speak
to your bride.

2246
02:12:53,645 --> 02:12:55,943
This wedding is going to
take place on schedule.

2247
02:12:56,014 --> 02:12:57,948
And it is going to
be done right.

2248
02:12:58,016 --> 02:13:00,041
Once you're safe
in our railroad car

2249
02:13:00,118 --> 02:13:03,144
and on your way to Arkansas,
you can indulge your whim.

2250
02:13:03,221 --> 02:13:04,347
Until then...

2251
02:13:04,423 --> 02:13:06,550
Arkansas?

2252
02:13:06,625 --> 02:13:08,490
What about Arkansas?

2253
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:10,551
Cordy, I'm sorry.

2254
02:13:10,629 --> 02:13:13,757
Well, what are you sorry about?

2255
02:13:13,832 --> 02:13:17,359
I have arranged
for our private railroad car

2256
02:13:17,436 --> 02:13:20,701
to take you and Angier
to Hot Springs

2257
02:13:20,772 --> 02:13:22,672
then back to New York
in two weeks

2258
02:13:22,741 --> 02:13:25,403
for the board of directors'
meeting.

2259
02:13:27,079 --> 02:13:28,842
Angie.

2260
02:13:28,914 --> 02:13:30,472
How could you?

2261
02:13:30,549 --> 02:13:34,246
Well, what, please tell me,
is wrong with Hot Springs?

2262
02:13:35,354 --> 02:13:38,152
I'm sure nothing is wrong
with it, Mrs. Duke.

2263
02:13:38,223 --> 02:13:41,158
But I'm not going to spend
my honeymoon there.

2264
02:13:41,226 --> 02:13:43,456
Cordy, if we could just
talk things over.

2265
02:13:43,528 --> 02:13:45,621
Just like I'm not going to
live in New York.

2266
02:13:45,697 --> 02:13:49,098
Of course you're going to
live in New York.

2267
02:13:49,434 --> 02:13:51,197
Because I'm not going to
marry you.

2268
02:13:51,269 --> 02:13:52,827
What?
- Cordy.

2269
02:13:52,904 --> 02:13:55,338
You most certainly are
going to marry him.

2270
02:13:55,407 --> 02:13:57,739
She doesn't have to
if she doesn't want to.

2271
02:13:57,809 --> 02:13:59,276
Anthony.

2272
02:13:59,845 --> 02:14:03,110
What happened to the person
I fell in love with?

2273
02:14:03,515 --> 02:14:07,076
A person with dreams and spirit.

2274
02:14:07,152 --> 02:14:10,417
Someone I could believe in
and root for.

2275
02:14:10,489 --> 02:14:14,721
Someone who could make a car
any color you want.

2276
02:14:16,128 --> 02:14:17,060
Oh, no.

2277
02:14:17,129 --> 02:14:19,495
I'm not getting married.

2278
02:14:20,966 --> 02:14:23,230
- Then I'm not, either!
- Sir!

2279
02:14:23,301 --> 02:14:25,462
I found them, sir.

2280
02:14:26,138 --> 02:14:28,402
200 invitations.

2281
02:14:28,840 --> 02:14:30,865
They were lost
under the clothes we collected

2282
02:14:30,942 --> 02:14:33,069
for the Chinese missions.

2283
02:14:39,217 --> 02:14:41,378
That's very funny.

2284
02:14:42,154 --> 02:14:44,588
No.
It really is.

2285
02:14:45,223 --> 02:14:48,784
You'll pardon me
for not laughing.

2286
02:14:49,561 --> 02:14:51,051
Angier!

2287
02:14:51,997 --> 02:14:53,828
Angier!

2288
02:14:55,600 --> 02:14:56,532
Angier!

2289
02:14:56,601 --> 02:15:00,059
John, maybe you'd better
follow him.

2290
02:15:00,138 --> 02:15:01,628
Yes, sir.

2291
02:15:08,313 --> 02:15:12,147
Mr. Biddle, what do you intend
to do about this?

2292
02:15:12,217 --> 02:15:13,206
Do about it?

2293
02:15:13,285 --> 02:15:16,220
Yes. You do intend to do
something, don't you?

2294
02:15:16,288 --> 02:15:18,051
Yes, Anthony.
What now?

2295
02:15:18,123 --> 02:15:20,216
Well, I don't know.
What do you suggest?

2296
02:15:20,292 --> 02:15:22,954
I suggest you talk some sense
into your daughter.

2297
02:15:23,028 --> 02:15:25,223
For once I agree
with Mrs. Duke completely.

2298
02:15:25,297 --> 02:15:26,229
Wait a minute.

2299
02:15:26,298 --> 02:15:29,461
What about trying to talk some
sense into your son, Mrs. Duke?

2300
02:15:29,534 --> 02:15:31,798
I'll take care of Angier.

2301
02:15:32,571 --> 02:15:37,031
Mrs. Duke, may I offer you
a lift to your hotel?

2302
02:15:37,109 --> 02:15:38,633
My electric is waiting outside.

2303
02:15:38,710 --> 02:15:40,803
Oh, how very kind of you.

2304
02:15:40,879 --> 02:15:43,040
It's comforting to know
that there are those

2305
02:15:43,115 --> 02:15:46,084
who can be relied upon
for support in times of stress.

2306
02:15:47,285 --> 02:15:50,186
They're trying to lay
this whole mess in my lap.

2307
02:15:51,423 --> 02:15:54,187
We'd better get back
to our guests.

2308
02:15:55,427 --> 02:15:57,088
They're trying to blame me.

2309
02:15:57,162 --> 02:16:00,620
Anyone can misplace a box
of invitations, can't they?

2310
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:02,831
You know very well, Anthony,

2311
02:16:02,901 --> 02:16:04,994
the invitations have nothing
to do with it.

2312
02:16:05,070 --> 02:16:09,097
That was just fate lending you
a helping hand.

2313
02:16:09,875 --> 02:16:11,365
Blast.

2314
02:16:13,411 --> 02:16:15,709
I didn't do anything wrong.

2315
02:16:16,248 --> 02:16:17,408
Did I, George?

2316
02:16:20,185 --> 02:16:22,415
- Hey, here he is!
- Come on, Mr. Biddle.

2317
02:16:22,487 --> 02:16:25,115
- We want to drink a toast.
- To the father of the bride!

2318
02:16:25,190 --> 02:16:26,122
Now, just a second.

2319
02:16:26,191 --> 02:16:27,453
- Outside!
- A toast!

2320
02:16:27,526 --> 02:16:29,153
Three cheers!

2321
02:16:30,362 --> 02:16:32,489
<i>? For he's a jolly good
fellow?</i>

2322
02:16:32,564 --> 02:16:34,828
<i>? For he's a jolly good
fellow?</i>

2323
02:16:49,447 --> 02:16:51,244
Excuse me, gentlemen.

2324
02:16:58,323 --> 02:16:59,915
Stout!

2325
02:16:59,991 --> 02:17:01,925
Did you ever try
a good Irish stout?

2326
02:17:01,993 --> 02:17:03,324
Look, you stay away from me.

2327
02:17:03,395 --> 02:17:05,761
Just a friendly suggestion, sir.

2328
02:17:06,531 --> 02:17:08,021
You followed me here,
didn't you?

2329
02:17:08,099 --> 02:17:09,031
The devil, I did.

2330
02:17:09,100 --> 02:17:11,625
Do you think you're the only
person that comes into Clancy's

2331
02:17:11,703 --> 02:17:13,432
for a little rest
and relaxation?

2332
02:17:13,505 --> 02:17:14,972
All right, just leave me alone

2333
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:17,474
and keep your suggestions
to yourself.

2334
02:17:17,542 --> 02:17:18,736
Stout.

2335
02:17:21,046 --> 02:17:23,105
I'm tired of people
running my life for me.

2336
02:17:23,181 --> 02:17:24,808
As well you should be, sir.

2337
02:17:24,883 --> 02:17:26,942
Leading me by the hand.
Telling me what to do.

2338
02:17:27,018 --> 02:17:28,679
It's a crime.

2339
02:17:29,754 --> 02:17:31,915
A man has to finally be a man.

2340
02:17:31,990 --> 02:17:33,150
- Right!
- Right!

2341
02:17:33,225 --> 02:17:35,216
<i>? Well, well, well,
"Let's have a drink on it"?</i>

2342
02:17:35,293 --> 02:17:36,920
<i>? As me father used to say?</i>

2343
02:17:36,995 --> 02:17:39,225
<i>? "When the truth is
nobly spoken?</i>

2344
02:17:39,297 --> 02:17:41,390
<i>? It's respect
you've got to pay"?</i>

2345
02:17:41,466 --> 02:17:43,457
<i>? So fill your cup
and lift it up?</i>

2346
02:17:43,535 --> 02:17:45,696
<i>? And clink, here's how?</i>

2347
02:17:45,770 --> 02:17:47,704
<i>? No shilly-shallying,
no dillydallying?</i>

2348
02:17:47,772 --> 02:17:49,637
<i>? Let's have a drink
on it now?</i>

2349
02:17:49,708 --> 02:17:51,676
<i>? No shilly-shallying,
no dillydallying?</i>

2350
02:17:51,743 --> 02:17:54,439
<i>? Let's have a drink
on it now?</i>

2351
02:18:01,453 --> 02:18:02,647
I don't mind telling you.

2352
02:18:02,721 --> 02:18:04,882
These last weeks
have really been rough.

2353
02:18:04,956 --> 02:18:06,287
That's a fact.

2354
02:18:06,358 --> 02:18:08,223
You try to please everybody.

2355
02:18:08,293 --> 02:18:10,693
And you end up pleasing
no one at all.

2356
02:18:10,762 --> 02:18:12,423
'Tis the sad, sad truth, sir.

2357
02:18:12,497 --> 02:18:13,759
I'll get away from it all.

2358
02:18:13,832 --> 02:18:14,821
Good idea.

2359
02:18:14,899 --> 02:18:16,890
I'll leave Philadelphia
and never come back.

2360
02:18:16,968 --> 02:18:18,435
- Never?
- Never.

2361
02:18:20,038 --> 02:18:21,733
Well, why shouldn't I?

2362
02:18:21,806 --> 02:18:24,001
There's nothing but trouble
for me here.

2363
02:18:24,075 --> 02:18:26,168
There's nothing but trouble
for me anywhere.

2364
02:18:26,244 --> 02:18:29,475
If I were to go to the ends
of the Earth...

2365
02:18:30,482 --> 02:18:31,972
That's it.

2366
02:18:32,384 --> 02:18:34,249
I could join the Foreign Legion.

2367
02:18:34,319 --> 02:18:36,810
The Foreign Legion, sir.
A fine group of men, sir.

2368
02:18:36,888 --> 02:18:38,446
I'd be on my own, then, right?

2369
02:18:38,523 --> 02:18:39,490
Right!

2370
02:18:39,557 --> 02:18:41,525
<i>? Well, well, well,
let's have a drink on it?</i>

2371
02:18:41,593 --> 02:18:43,493
<i>? To the fightin'
Legionnaires?</i>

2372
02:18:43,561 --> 02:18:45,461
<i>? To their outposts
in the desert?</i>

2373
02:18:45,530 --> 02:18:47,828
<i>? And their gorgeous
Croix de Guerres?</i>

2374
02:18:47,899 --> 02:18:52,893
<i>? To sailing for Bengasi
on a rusty scow?</i>

2375
02:18:52,971 --> 02:18:54,962
<i>? No shilly-shallying,
no dillydallying?</i>

2376
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:56,871
<i>? Let's have a drink
on it now?</i>

2377
02:18:56,941 --> 02:18:58,909
<i>? No shilly-shallying,
no dillydallying?</i>

2378
02:18:58,977 --> 02:19:01,605
<i>? Let's have a drink
on it now?</i>

2379
02:19:04,983 --> 02:19:05,972
Thank you, John.

2380
02:19:06,051 --> 02:19:07,814
I'll always be grateful
for your help.

2381
02:19:07,886 --> 02:19:08,978
Where are you going?

2382
02:19:09,054 --> 02:19:10,487
To Bengasi.
Like we said.

2383
02:19:10,555 --> 02:19:11,647
I can't let him get away.

2384
02:19:11,723 --> 02:19:13,156
We'll never get things
patched up.

2385
02:19:13,224 --> 02:19:14,191
Sir!

2386
02:19:14,259 --> 02:19:15,692
A moment of your time, sir!

2387
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:17,193
Just a moment!

2388
02:19:17,262 --> 02:19:19,822
<i>? What do you do
when the water's gone?</i>

2389
02:19:19,898 --> 02:19:22,162
<i>? And there's no
turning back??</i>

2390
02:19:22,233 --> 02:19:24,030
<i>? You're four days
from the fort?</i>

2391
02:19:24,102 --> 02:19:26,662
<i>? The Arab renegades attack?</i>

2392
02:19:26,738 --> 02:19:31,107
<i>? And the blistering sun
keeps burning?</i>

2393
02:19:31,176 --> 02:19:36,204
<i>? Reinforcements
can't get through?</i>

2394
02:19:36,281 --> 02:19:40,183
<i>? What do you do about it??</i>

2395
02:19:40,251 --> 02:19:46,190
<i>? What do you do about it??</i>

2396
02:19:46,257 --> 02:19:47,690
Do you blister easily?

2397
02:19:47,759 --> 02:19:49,021
Yes, as a matter of fact.

2398
02:19:49,094 --> 02:19:51,619
The Foreign Legion
is not for you.

2399
02:19:51,696 --> 02:19:53,163
Drink up.

2400
02:19:56,935 --> 02:19:59,233
You're right, John.
Running away isn't the answer.

2401
02:19:59,304 --> 02:20:01,067
You're right.
I'm right, all right.

2402
02:20:01,139 --> 02:20:03,471
I've got to face my problem
head on.

2403
02:20:03,541 --> 02:20:05,668
All right.
What's my problem?

2404
02:20:05,744 --> 02:20:07,006
My problem is my family.

2405
02:20:07,078 --> 02:20:08,705
It always has been.

2406
02:20:08,780 --> 02:20:10,543
I'll change my name.

2407
02:20:10,615 --> 02:20:11,582
Renounce my fortune.

2408
02:20:11,649 --> 02:20:13,082
That's good thinking.

2409
02:20:13,151 --> 02:20:15,142
I'll take an honest job.

2410
02:20:15,220 --> 02:20:16,414
In a factory.

2411
02:20:16,488 --> 02:20:17,887
Or on a farm.

2412
02:20:17,956 --> 02:20:19,548
Maybe someday I'll have
my own place.

2413
02:20:19,624 --> 02:20:21,922
- Beautiful!
- I'll be like everybody else.

2414
02:20:21,993 --> 02:20:23,585
Poor, right?

2415
02:20:23,661 --> 02:20:24,593
- Right!
- Right!

2416
02:20:24,662 --> 02:20:26,459
<i>? Well, well, well,
let's have a drink on it?</i>

2417
02:20:26,531 --> 02:20:28,556
<i>? To the simple, average life?</i>

2418
02:20:28,633 --> 02:20:30,328
<i>? To the wages every Friday?</i>

2419
02:20:30,402 --> 02:20:32,370
<i>? That you bring home
to the wife?</i>

2420
02:20:32,437 --> 02:20:37,238
<i>? To the sweat of honest labor
on your average brow?</i>

2421
02:20:37,308 --> 02:20:39,173
<i>? No shilly-shallying,
no dillydallying?</i>

2422
02:20:39,244 --> 02:20:41,144
<i>? Let's have a drink
on it now?</i>

2423
02:20:41,212 --> 02:20:43,146
<i>? No shilly-shallying,
no dillydallying?</i>

2424
02:20:43,214 --> 02:20:44,704
<i>? Let's have a drink
on it now?</i>

2425
02:20:44,783 --> 02:20:48,219
Hey!
Set 'em up, Clancy!

2426
02:20:48,920 --> 02:20:50,353
Whoo!

2427
02:20:50,422 --> 02:20:51,719
Hey!

2428
02:20:52,223 --> 02:20:54,657
The drinks are on the Duke!

2429
02:20:57,028 --> 02:20:58,859
<i>? No shilly-shallying,
no dillydallying?</i>

2430
02:20:58,930 --> 02:21:01,421
<i>? Let's have a drink
on it now?</i>

2431
02:21:04,769 --> 02:21:06,430
Thank you all!

2432
02:21:06,504 --> 02:21:08,995
I can't tell you how much
this talk has meant to me.

2433
02:21:09,073 --> 02:21:10,005
Not at all at all.

2434
02:21:10,074 --> 02:21:12,440
- I'll write when I get settled.
- You'll write...

2435
02:21:12,510 --> 02:21:14,444
From where are you gonna write?

2436
02:21:14,512 --> 02:21:16,776
When a man has reached
a turning point in his life,

2437
02:21:16,848 --> 02:21:19,180
why waste time?

2438
02:21:19,517 --> 02:21:23,317
<i>? What do you do
when you lose your job??</i>

2439
02:21:23,388 --> 02:21:26,482
<i>? The rent is overdue??</i>

2440
02:21:26,558 --> 02:21:30,016
<i>? The landlord throws you
in the street?</i>

2441
02:21:30,094 --> 02:21:33,530
<i>? The wife, the kiddies, too?</i>

2442
02:21:33,598 --> 02:21:39,662
<i>? And the sleet and snow
are falling?</i>

2443
02:21:39,737 --> 02:21:46,142
<i>? And you've got
no place to go?</i>

2444
02:21:49,914 --> 02:21:51,040
Will you shut your face?

2445
02:21:51,115 --> 02:21:53,811
Can't you see I'm talking
to the gentleman?

2446
02:21:54,619 --> 02:21:59,488
<i>? What do you do about it??</i>

2447
02:21:59,557 --> 02:22:05,655
<i>? What do you do about it??</i>

2448
02:22:05,730 --> 02:22:08,130
The simple, average life, sir.

2449
02:22:08,199 --> 02:22:09,564
No.

2450
02:22:10,535 --> 02:22:11,934
Have a drink.

2451
02:22:18,476 --> 02:22:19,841
I'm used to having money.

2452
02:22:19,911 --> 02:22:21,936
I might as well admit it.

2453
02:22:22,580 --> 02:22:23,569
I know.

2454
02:22:23,648 --> 02:22:25,309
I could make my own fortune.

2455
02:22:25,383 --> 02:22:28,181
- I could drill for oil in Texas.
- Think it over carefully.

2456
02:22:28,253 --> 02:22:30,847
- I could pan for gold in Alaska.
- Don't be too hasty.

2457
02:22:30,922 --> 02:22:32,082
Wait.

2458
02:22:32,156 --> 02:22:36,055
The pearl trade in China.

2459
02:22:36,127 --> 02:22:37,719
The mysterious East.

2460
02:22:37,795 --> 02:22:39,695
Who knows what adventures
I might live there?

2461
02:22:39,764 --> 02:22:40,696
- Right.
- Right!

2462
02:22:40,765 --> 02:22:42,096
<i>- Wrong.
-? Well, well, well?</i>

2463
02:22:42,166 --> 02:22:43,292
<i>? Let's have a drink on it?</i>

2464
02:22:43,368 --> 02:22:45,268
<i>? Here's to China
across the bay?</i>

2465
02:22:45,336 --> 02:22:47,270
<i>? To them darling
little oysters?</i>

2466
02:22:47,338 --> 02:22:49,397
<i>? And the pearls
they give away?</i>

2467
02:22:49,474 --> 02:22:52,409
<i>? A man could make
his fortune there?</i>

2468
02:22:52,477 --> 02:22:56,106
<i>? I will somehow?</i>

2469
02:22:56,180 --> 02:22:58,080
<i>? No shilly-shallying,
no dillydallying?</i>

2470
02:22:58,149 --> 02:23:00,083
<i>? I'm off to China now?</i>

2471
02:23:00,151 --> 02:23:01,914
<i>? No shilly-shallying,
no dillydallying?</i>

2472
02:23:01,986 --> 02:23:04,352
<i>? He's off to China now?</i>

2473
02:23:18,803 --> 02:23:20,703
<i>? No shilly-shallying,
no dillydallying?</i>

2474
02:23:20,772 --> 02:23:23,172
<i>? Let's have
another one, sir!?</i>

2475
02:23:44,162 --> 02:23:46,995
<i>? No shilly-shallying,
no dillydallying?</i>

2476
02:24:00,578 --> 02:24:01,909
Ha!

2477
02:24:26,004 --> 02:24:27,528
Ooh! Ooh!

2478
02:24:54,165 --> 02:24:56,099
<i>? No shilly-shallying,
no dillydallying?</i>

2479
02:24:56,167 --> 02:24:58,431
<i>? I'm off to China now?</i>

2480
02:24:58,503 --> 02:25:00,403
<i>? Well, well, well,
one last drink on it?</i>

2481
02:25:00,471 --> 02:25:02,268
<i>? Then you're on
your merry way?</i>

2482
02:25:02,340 --> 02:25:04,638
<i>? What do you do when
your sampan springs a leak?</i>

2483
02:25:04,709 --> 02:25:05,835
<i>? In China Bay??</i>

2484
02:25:05,910 --> 02:25:07,537
<i>? When the truth is
nobly spoken?</i>

2485
02:25:07,612 --> 02:25:09,637
<i>? It's respect
you've got to pay?</i>

2486
02:25:09,714 --> 02:25:13,275
<i>? Them Oriental pirates come
and take your pearls away?</i>

2487
02:25:13,351 --> 02:25:15,216
<i>? So fill your cup
and lift it up?</i>

2488
02:25:15,286 --> 02:25:17,186
<i>-? And clink, here's how?
- Do you eat fish heads?</i>

2489
02:25:17,255 --> 02:25:19,018
<i>? No shilly-shallying,
no dillydallying?</i>

2490
02:25:19,090 --> 02:25:20,079
<i>? Let's have a drink
on it now?</i>

2491
02:25:20,158 --> 02:25:22,422
Are you immune to yellow fever?

2492
02:25:22,493 --> 02:25:24,859
Bubonic plague!

2493
02:25:24,929 --> 02:25:26,624
Monsoons!

2494
02:25:26,698 --> 02:25:28,097
Locusts!

2495
02:25:28,166 --> 02:25:30,634
The screaming abdabs!

2496
02:25:30,702 --> 02:25:34,638
Oh, the shame of it all!

2497
02:25:35,807 --> 02:25:40,301
Do that again, me buckle,
and you won't be going anywhere.

2498
02:25:41,112 --> 02:25:43,637
Clancy, two more.

2499
02:25:53,257 --> 02:25:56,021
Have a drink, sir.
All the very best.

2500
02:26:18,182 --> 02:26:21,083
Are you all right, lad?
There's nothing broken, I hope.

2501
02:26:21,152 --> 02:26:22,779
I think we best be going
to the hotel

2502
02:26:22,854 --> 02:26:25,118
to have the house doctor take
a look at you.

2503
02:26:26,824 --> 02:26:28,655
Excuse me, John.

2504
02:27:13,504 --> 02:27:14,835
Aah!

2505
02:27:28,419 --> 02:27:30,410
Oh! Oh!

2506
02:27:38,830 --> 02:27:40,354
Oh!

2507
02:27:49,574 --> 02:27:52,168
Oh! Oh!

2508
02:28:06,757 --> 02:28:08,725
Ooh!

2509
02:28:24,842 --> 02:28:27,208
All right, I say!

2510
02:28:27,278 --> 02:28:28,575
Quiet!

2511
02:28:31,048 --> 02:28:32,310
Quiet!

2512
02:28:32,383 --> 02:28:33,850
All right, now.

2513
02:28:33,918 --> 02:28:36,045
Who started all this?

2514
02:28:36,120 --> 02:28:37,587
Well, come on.
Come on.

2515
02:28:37,655 --> 02:28:40,021
Somebody speak up,
or I'll jail the lot of youse

2516
02:28:40,091 --> 02:28:42,685
just as sure
as my name's Flanagan.

2517
02:28:42,760 --> 02:28:45,752
Seems a shame to punish men for
defending their mother country.

2518
02:28:45,830 --> 02:28:47,161
What's that?

2519
02:28:47,231 --> 02:28:49,256
I wasn't a part of it meself,
you understand.

2520
02:28:49,333 --> 02:28:52,063
But I did see it all
from first to last.

2521
02:28:52,136 --> 02:28:53,501
And?

2522
02:28:53,571 --> 02:28:56,335
Well, it all started
when the young gentleman there

2523
02:28:56,407 --> 02:28:59,968
expressed the opinion
that all Irishmen were pigs.

2524
02:29:00,044 --> 02:29:03,377
And the Emerald Isle
the proper sty for them.

2525
02:29:03,447 --> 02:29:06,041
Oh, he did, did he?
Huh?

2526
02:29:06,117 --> 02:29:07,049
He did indeed.

2527
02:29:07,118 --> 02:29:08,847
I see.

2528
02:29:08,920 --> 02:29:10,251
All right, you two.

2529
02:29:10,321 --> 02:29:13,757
Bring young Mr. Fancy Dan along.

2530
02:29:14,425 --> 02:29:15,790
Hey!

2531
02:29:15,860 --> 02:29:17,919
And I'll thank you
to come along, too, sir.

2532
02:29:17,995 --> 02:29:20,293
The captain will be delighted
to hear what you told me.

2533
02:29:20,364 --> 02:29:22,025
I consider it me duty, Sergeant.

2534
02:29:22,099 --> 02:29:24,329
All right.
Bring him along.

2535
02:29:29,106 --> 02:29:31,802
Have no fear, lad.
I'm looking out for you.

2536
02:29:38,215 --> 02:29:40,240
Good morning, Cordelia.

2537
02:29:43,187 --> 02:29:45,519
How is Cordy this morning?
Have you seen her?

2538
02:29:48,492 --> 02:29:50,517
I had a cold shower
and a good, brisk walk.

2539
02:29:50,594 --> 02:29:52,255
And now I'm hungry.

2540
02:29:54,999 --> 02:29:56,466
Thank you, my dear.

2541
02:30:00,137 --> 02:30:01,764
Yes, ma'am?

2542
02:30:02,306 --> 02:30:03,238
Yes, sir?

2543
02:30:03,307 --> 02:30:06,140
I think I'll start
with some orange juice.

2544
02:30:06,210 --> 02:30:07,177
Who are you?

2545
02:30:07,244 --> 02:30:08,575
I'm Deborah, sir.

2546
02:30:08,646 --> 02:30:11,809
Well.
Good morning, Deborah.

2547
02:30:12,216 --> 02:30:13,774
Good morning, sir.

2548
02:30:13,851 --> 02:30:16,376
I think after the orange juice
I'd like some cereal.

2549
02:30:16,454 --> 02:30:17,944
Yes, sir.

2550
02:30:19,957 --> 02:30:22,221
Pleasant-enough-looking girl,
isn't she?

2551
02:30:24,295 --> 02:30:25,694
Confound it, Cordelia.

2552
02:30:25,763 --> 02:30:28,027
You can't go on ignoring me
like this forever.

2553
02:30:28,099 --> 02:30:30,590
And that's how long it will be
before I respond

2554
02:30:30,668 --> 02:30:32,693
to such childish behavior.

2555
02:30:34,105 --> 02:30:36,835
What do you want from me?
Let's hear it.

2556
02:30:38,376 --> 02:30:39,638
Some kind of confession.

2557
02:30:39,710 --> 02:30:41,507
That's what you want, isn't it?

2558
02:30:41,579 --> 02:30:42,876
You're not going to get it.

2559
02:30:42,947 --> 02:30:44,915
I have nothing to confess.

2560
02:30:47,318 --> 02:30:49,445
Will that be hot
or cold cereal, sir?

2561
02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:50,782
Neither one, blast it!

2562
02:30:50,855 --> 02:30:52,482
I'm not hungry.

2563
02:30:54,558 --> 02:30:55,991
I will admit I have wondered

2564
02:30:56,060 --> 02:30:57,618
if Angie was the right man
for Cordy.

2565
02:30:57,695 --> 02:30:59,253
But she made her choice.

2566
02:30:59,330 --> 02:31:02,356
And I accepted it,
I think, gracefully.

2567
02:31:03,567 --> 02:31:05,967
I've just been myself,
that's all.

2568
02:31:06,037 --> 02:31:09,234
You've been yourself in spades.

2569
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:11,273
Cordelia.

2570
02:31:11,342 --> 02:31:13,810
Where did you learn
that back-room expression?

2571
02:31:13,878 --> 02:31:16,813
You played into every
possible source of trouble

2572
02:31:16,881 --> 02:31:18,143
from the first.

2573
02:31:18,215 --> 02:31:20,877
Oh, there was trouble
to play into, I'll grant.

2574
02:31:20,951 --> 02:31:23,852
You didn't create it,
but how you took advantage.

2575
02:31:23,921 --> 02:31:26,014
I deny that.

2576
02:31:26,791 --> 02:31:28,418
Then let me put it this way.

2577
02:31:28,492 --> 02:31:31,620
Have you done one thing
to help this marriage?

2578
02:31:31,695 --> 02:31:34,687
I don't believe
that's my responsibility.

2579
02:31:34,765 --> 02:31:36,756
Isn't it, Anthony?

2580
02:31:37,501 --> 02:31:39,935
I know of nothing
I've done wrong.

2581
02:31:41,439 --> 02:31:42,804
Nothing.

2582
02:31:45,943 --> 02:31:48,138
You know it in your heart.

2583
02:31:48,212 --> 02:31:50,476
Or you wouldn't be so angry.

2584
02:31:51,749 --> 02:31:53,614
Good morning.

2585
02:31:53,951 --> 02:31:55,919
Good morning, Mother.

2586
02:31:55,986 --> 02:31:58,113
Good morning, Papa.

2587
02:31:59,990 --> 02:32:02,117
How about a jog
around the square?

2588
02:32:02,193 --> 02:32:03,421
Why, Cordy.

2589
02:32:03,494 --> 02:32:05,325
Or maybe a few rounds
in the gym?

2590
02:32:05,396 --> 02:32:06,590
Confound it, Cordy.

2591
02:32:06,664 --> 02:32:09,758
You can't come popping in here,
gay as a cricket.

2592
02:32:09,834 --> 02:32:12,394
Why not?
How should I be?

2593
02:32:13,504 --> 02:32:15,028
Cordy.

2594
02:32:15,106 --> 02:32:16,630
What are we going to do?

2595
02:32:16,707 --> 02:32:18,004
About what, Mother?

2596
02:32:18,075 --> 02:32:19,906
About your marriage.

2597
02:32:19,977 --> 02:32:21,205
It's been called off.

2598
02:32:21,278 --> 02:32:22,939
Don't you remember?

2599
02:32:24,615 --> 02:32:26,173
I'll be in the stable.

2600
02:32:26,250 --> 02:32:28,150
Cordy.

2601
02:32:30,554 --> 02:32:32,078
Cordy, wait.

2602
02:32:40,397 --> 02:32:41,227
Cordy.

2603
02:32:41,298 --> 02:32:43,493
I don't want to
talk about it, Papa.

2604
02:32:43,567 --> 02:32:45,228
I don't want to talk, either.

2605
02:32:45,302 --> 02:32:47,133
But that doesn't mean
I'm not going to.

2606
02:32:47,204 --> 02:32:49,672
There's nothing to talk about.

2607
02:32:51,475 --> 02:32:54,137
You never really approved
of Angie.

2608
02:32:54,211 --> 02:32:56,076
And you were right.

2609
02:32:56,814 --> 02:32:58,577
He's a baby.

2610
02:32:58,649 --> 02:33:00,617
A mama's boy.

2611
02:33:00,684 --> 02:33:03,653
He doesn't know
what life is all about.

2612
02:33:03,721 --> 02:33:05,416
He'll learn.

2613
02:33:06,524 --> 02:33:08,458
Maybe you'll learn together.

2614
02:33:08,959 --> 02:33:11,325
But you can't take his part now.

2615
02:33:11,395 --> 02:33:13,056
I'm not taking his part.

2616
02:33:13,130 --> 02:33:15,189
But I've got nothing
against that boy, Cordy.

2617
02:33:15,266 --> 02:33:16,790
I never did.

2618
02:33:17,434 --> 02:33:22,497
Except that I wanted you
to stay here.

2619
02:33:22,940 --> 02:33:24,601
That's the truth.

2620
02:33:27,278 --> 02:33:30,770
You try to make a good life
for yourself and your family.

2621
02:33:30,848 --> 02:33:34,750
And turns out to be too good.

2622
02:33:35,486 --> 02:33:38,683
So you can't resist
trying to hold on.

2623
02:33:39,757 --> 02:33:43,818
Whatever you decide to do,
Cordy, I'll back you up 100%.

2624
02:33:43,894 --> 02:33:45,156
But you decide.

2625
02:33:45,229 --> 02:33:46,890
On your own.

2626
02:33:47,431 --> 02:33:49,558
It's your life.

2627
02:33:49,633 --> 02:33:54,696
I'm finally giving it over
to you.

2628
02:34:05,616 --> 02:34:07,140
Where is he?

2629
02:34:07,885 --> 02:34:09,147
Good morning, Mrs. Duke.

2630
02:34:09,220 --> 02:34:11,347
If you know where he is,
please tell me.

2631
02:34:11,422 --> 02:34:13,686
I'll find out
in good time anyway.

2632
02:34:13,757 --> 02:34:14,689
Do you mean Angie?

2633
02:34:14,758 --> 02:34:16,282
Of course I mean Angier.

2634
02:34:16,360 --> 02:34:18,260
- Well, what's happened?
- He's disappeared.

2635
02:34:18,329 --> 02:34:19,318
Disappeared?

2636
02:34:19,396 --> 02:34:21,921
He wasn't in his hotel room
all night.

2637
02:34:21,999 --> 02:34:24,593
His bed has not been slept in.

2638
02:34:24,668 --> 02:34:26,829
Who knows what has happened
to him?

2639
02:34:26,904 --> 02:34:27,871
John!

2640
02:34:27,938 --> 02:34:30,304
Now, don't worry, Mrs. Duke.
We'll find him.

2641
02:34:30,374 --> 02:34:32,001
- John!
- You called, sir?

2642
02:34:32,076 --> 02:34:33,373
I yelled.

2643
02:34:33,444 --> 02:34:35,935
John, I thought I asked you
to watch out for Mr. Duke.

2644
02:34:36,013 --> 02:34:37,640
- I did.
- What happened to your eye?

2645
02:34:37,715 --> 02:34:38,682
He hit me, sir.

2646
02:34:38,749 --> 02:34:40,774
Angier?

2647
02:34:40,851 --> 02:34:41,613
When?

2648
02:34:41,685 --> 02:34:43,118
Last night at the jailhouse.

2649
02:34:43,187 --> 02:34:44,586
The jailhouse?

2650
02:34:44,655 --> 02:34:47,988
They'll release him as soon as
I withdraw the charges, ma'am.

2651
02:34:48,058 --> 02:34:50,151
Well, we'd better get down there
right away.

2652
02:34:50,227 --> 02:34:51,626
I'll hurry and get dressed.

2653
02:34:51,695 --> 02:34:53,128
Yes, Cordelia.

2654
02:34:53,197 --> 02:34:56,223
Mrs. Duke, why don't you wait
out here on the terrace?

2655
02:34:56,300 --> 02:34:58,461
John, bring the car
around front, will you?

2656
02:34:58,535 --> 02:35:02,437
We'll have this unfortunate
situation cleared up in no time.

2657
02:35:26,563 --> 02:35:28,155
Oh, dear.
I may faint.

2658
02:35:28,232 --> 02:35:30,462
On this floor?
Don't even think of it.

2659
02:35:37,941 --> 02:35:39,203
Mrs. Duke,

2660
02:35:39,276 --> 02:35:42,302
perhaps it'd be better
if you ladies waited here.

2661
02:35:54,091 --> 02:35:55,422
All right, Mr. Duke.

2662
02:35:55,492 --> 02:35:57,426
You can come out now.

2663
02:35:57,961 --> 02:36:00,953
I'd just as soon stay
right here.

2664
02:36:02,633 --> 02:36:05,101
Well, that's a pretty
silly attitude.

2665
02:36:05,969 --> 02:36:08,062
It isn't silly at all.

2666
02:36:08,138 --> 02:36:12,370
I'm afraid if I stand up
my head will fall off.

2667
02:36:14,912 --> 02:36:17,642
Did you ever try
a good Irish stout?

2668
02:36:18,382 --> 02:36:19,974
Come along.
Come along, Mr. Duke.

2669
02:36:20,050 --> 02:36:21,847
It's time to go now.

2670
02:36:21,919 --> 02:36:25,116
Why couldn't you let me out
last night when I wanted out?

2671
02:36:25,189 --> 02:36:27,657
Where was it you wanted to go
last night?

2672
02:36:28,692 --> 02:36:31,923
I had decided on China.

2673
02:36:32,396 --> 02:36:34,830
How do feel about China
this morning?

2674
02:36:35,632 --> 02:36:37,964
Terrible.

2675
02:36:39,103 --> 02:36:41,071
Sergeant,
would you give us a minute?

2676
02:36:41,138 --> 02:36:43,368
Oh, certainly.
Certainly.

2677
02:36:44,608 --> 02:36:46,303
Young man.

2678
02:36:46,777 --> 02:36:49,712
It's time you woke up
to your responsibilities.

2679
02:36:49,780 --> 02:36:51,509
I want you to get
this marriage over with.

2680
02:36:51,582 --> 02:36:53,812
And that honeymoon
in the Ozarks.

2681
02:36:53,884 --> 02:36:56,250
Then report back to your desk
in New York.

2682
02:36:56,320 --> 02:36:57,378
What?

2683
02:36:57,454 --> 02:36:59,422
You may think you want
other things for yourself.

2684
02:36:59,490 --> 02:37:01,720
You may have some dreams
of your own.

2685
02:37:01,792 --> 02:37:03,521
But you'll have to get over
all that.

2686
02:37:03,594 --> 02:37:05,687
The way other people do.

2687
02:37:05,763 --> 02:37:07,663
Well, you didn't get over it.

2688
02:37:07,731 --> 02:37:10,461
Well, there are darn few
like me.

2689
02:37:12,069 --> 02:37:16,335
Now, you listen here,
Mr. Know-it-all Biddle.

2690
02:37:16,407 --> 02:37:18,932
No one is gonna run my life
for me.

2691
02:37:19,009 --> 02:37:21,705
I've decided that much.

2692
02:37:21,779 --> 02:37:24,179
Hangover or no hangover.

2693
02:37:24,248 --> 02:37:25,977
Is that so?

2694
02:37:26,049 --> 02:37:28,779
Yes.
That is so.

2695
02:37:29,119 --> 02:37:30,416
All right, Mr. Duke.

2696
02:37:30,487 --> 02:37:31,977
The door's open.

2697
02:37:32,055 --> 02:37:35,047
Let's see you have a try
at running your own life.

2698
02:37:35,125 --> 02:37:37,025
Let's see how far you can go.

2699
02:37:37,094 --> 02:37:39,995
Hangover or no hangover.

2700
02:37:40,063 --> 02:37:41,792
Mr. Biddle.

2701
02:37:42,766 --> 02:37:46,167
I am going to ask Cordy
to elope with me.

2702
02:37:46,236 --> 02:37:47,669
- Today.
- Now, wait a minute.

2703
02:37:47,738 --> 02:37:49,569
And don't you try to stop me.

2704
02:37:49,640 --> 02:37:51,574
Let me tell you one thing.

2705
02:37:52,209 --> 02:37:55,667
If you ask Cordy to elope,
she won't.

2706
02:37:57,614 --> 02:37:59,639
Then I'll tell her.

2707
02:38:04,555 --> 02:38:05,487
Angier.

2708
02:38:05,556 --> 02:38:07,285
Morning, Mother.

2709
02:38:07,858 --> 02:38:08,984
Cordy.

2710
02:38:09,059 --> 02:38:11,254
You and I are going to elope.

2711
02:38:11,328 --> 02:38:13,353
Over my dead body!

2712
02:38:13,430 --> 02:38:15,762
Only if absolutely necessary,
Mother.

2713
02:38:15,833 --> 02:38:18,233
We'll stop by your house
and pick up your things.

2714
02:38:18,302 --> 02:38:19,234
No.

2715
02:38:19,303 --> 02:38:20,235
Why?

2716
02:38:20,304 --> 02:38:22,829
Because I think he talked you
into it.

2717
02:38:22,906 --> 02:38:25,704
Cordy, I love you,
and I want to marry you.

2718
02:38:25,776 --> 02:38:28,370
And he's got nothing to do
with that.

2719
02:38:28,745 --> 02:38:31,111
I'm not so sure about that.

2720
02:38:33,083 --> 02:38:34,209
Papa!

2721
02:38:35,419 --> 02:38:37,011
So long, everybody.
We'll write.

2722
02:38:37,087 --> 02:38:39,055
Angier, where are you going?

2723
02:38:39,122 --> 02:38:42,387
<i>? You can here it humming,
see it coming?</i>

2724
02:38:42,459 --> 02:38:45,428
<i>? Feel it everywhere you go?</i>

2725
02:38:45,496 --> 02:38:48,624
<i>? It's tomorrow morning,
the future dawning?</i>

2726
02:38:48,699 --> 02:38:52,863
<i>? With a bright
and shining glow?</i>

2727
02:38:53,203 --> 02:38:56,400
<i>? It's a land
where golden chariots?</i>

2728
02:38:56,473 --> 02:38:59,533
<i>? Are molded out of dreams?</i>

2729
02:38:59,610 --> 02:39:02,773
<i>? It's Detroit?</i>

2730
02:39:02,846 --> 02:39:05,872
<i>? Detroit?</i>

2731
02:39:05,949 --> 02:39:09,282
<i>? It's Detroit?</i>

2732
02:39:17,794 --> 02:39:21,195
You know, there, for a minute,

2733
02:39:21,265 --> 02:39:24,598
he reminded me
of his grandfather.

2734
02:39:24,668 --> 02:39:27,603
Started the whole Duke thing.

2735
02:39:27,971 --> 02:39:29,370
If he's half the man
I think he is,

2736
02:39:29,439 --> 02:39:32,465
this won't be the end
of the whole Duke thing, either.

2737
02:40:10,480 --> 02:40:11,947
Did you hear that?

2738
02:40:13,016 --> 02:40:15,177
It's the floor, dear.

2739
02:40:16,553 --> 02:40:19,181
I never noticed it before.

2740
02:40:20,257 --> 02:40:22,316
This isn't a new house.

2741
02:40:22,392 --> 02:40:23,689
No.

2742
02:40:25,963 --> 02:40:27,760
No, it isn't.

2743
02:40:33,470 --> 02:40:34,630
I'm hungry.

2744
02:40:34,705 --> 02:40:36,900
Oh.
Poor dear.

2745
02:40:36,974 --> 02:40:39,238
You didn't have any breakfast,
did you?

2746
02:40:39,610 --> 02:40:40,770
I'll ring for John.

2747
02:40:40,844 --> 02:40:42,471
I don't need much.

2748
02:40:48,218 --> 02:40:49,685
What's that?

2749
02:40:50,253 --> 02:40:50,912
Hmm?

2750
02:40:50,988 --> 02:40:52,979
The clock, dear.

2751
02:40:53,056 --> 02:40:54,318
Oh.

2752
02:40:56,760 --> 02:40:58,455
A new one?

2753
02:40:58,528 --> 02:41:00,928
We've had it 20 years.

2754
02:41:00,998 --> 02:41:02,397
Oh.

2755
02:41:02,466 --> 02:41:04,331
You rang, ma'am?

2756
02:41:04,401 --> 02:41:05,993
Could we have some tea, please?

2757
02:41:06,069 --> 02:41:08,162
And there must be
some sandwiches left.

2758
02:41:08,238 --> 02:41:10,206
Oh, yes, ma'am.

2759
02:41:11,708 --> 02:41:14,677
Did everything turn out
all right down at the jailhouse?

2760
02:41:14,745 --> 02:41:17,543
Angie and Cordy are on their way
to Detroit.

2761
02:41:17,614 --> 02:41:19,104
Well.

2762
02:41:19,182 --> 02:41:21,412
That's grand news.

2763
02:41:21,485 --> 02:41:22,884
That's right.

2764
02:41:22,953 --> 02:41:25,547
That's right.
We're very happy about it.

2765
02:41:27,624 --> 02:41:28,886
I'll take that, ma'am.

2766
02:41:28,959 --> 02:41:30,551
Thank you, John.

2767
02:41:31,461 --> 02:41:33,861
Shouldn't we telephone
the boys about the wedding?

2768
02:41:33,930 --> 02:41:35,557
Oh, they'll be in class.

2769
02:41:35,632 --> 02:41:37,361
That's right.

2770
02:41:37,434 --> 02:41:40,130
Better wait until this evening.

2771
02:41:50,480 --> 02:41:53,381
- It's been a long time...
- We should let Aunt Mary know.

2772
02:41:54,651 --> 02:41:57,643
- What was that, Cordelia?
- I was thinking.

2773
02:41:57,721 --> 02:42:02,317
Maybe we could do some traveling
now that the children are all...

2774
02:42:02,392 --> 02:42:03,723
That's a good idea.

2775
02:42:03,794 --> 02:42:05,421
I've always wanted to travel.

2776
02:42:05,495 --> 02:42:08,555
We can go to Detroit
and see Cordy and Angie.

2777
02:42:08,932 --> 02:42:11,526
Oh, Anthony.

2778
02:42:12,002 --> 02:42:13,264
Yeah.

2779
02:42:25,615 --> 02:42:29,346
<i>? Let them go, let them go?</i>

2780
02:42:29,419 --> 02:42:33,287
<i>? Let them try their wings?</i>

2781
02:42:33,356 --> 02:42:40,387
<i>? Little birds were born
to fly?</i>

2782
02:42:40,464 --> 02:42:48,337
<i>? Not until they roam
can they miss their home?</i>

2783
02:42:48,405 --> 02:42:55,743
<i>? And it won't be long
till Christmas?</i>

2784
02:42:59,683 --> 02:43:03,517
<i>? When the branches are bare?</i>

2785
02:43:03,587 --> 02:43:07,148
<i>? The December air?</i>

2786
02:43:07,224 --> 02:43:14,562
<i>? Comes alive
with frost and pine?</i>

2787
02:43:14,631 --> 02:43:18,567
<i>? And they'll yearn to be?</i>

2788
02:43:18,635 --> 02:43:22,366
<i>? By the family tree?</i>

2789
02:43:22,439 --> 02:43:30,437
<i>? Oh, it won't be long
till Christmas?</i>

2790
02:43:30,514 --> 02:43:34,075
<i>? The years go by?</i>

2791
02:43:34,151 --> 02:43:37,814
<i>? And every night?</i>

2792
02:43:37,888 --> 02:43:44,817
<i>? You say, "Sweet dreams,
sleep tight"?</i>

2793
02:43:45,862 --> 02:43:53,997
<i>? Then comes the day
you're forced to say?</i>

2794
02:43:55,038 --> 02:43:57,598
<i>? "Don't forget to write"?</i>

2795
02:44:02,979 --> 02:44:07,416
<i>? There'll be holly
and popcorn?</i>

2796
02:44:07,484 --> 02:44:10,749
<i>? And mistletoe?</i>

2797
02:44:10,821 --> 02:44:17,886
<i>? There'll be songs
by fireglow?</i>

2798
02:44:18,662 --> 02:44:26,626
<i>? Oh, it won't be long
till Christmas?</i>

2799
02:44:27,838 --> 02:44:31,296
<i>? Let them go?</i>

2800
02:44:32,776 --> 02:44:38,737
<i>? Let them go?</i>

2801
02:44:53,897 --> 02:45:01,065
<i>? It won't be long
till Christmas?</i>

2802
02:45:02,672 --> 02:45:06,574
<i>? Let them go?</i>

2803
02:45:10,814 --> 02:45:18,744
<i>? Let them go?</i>

2804
02:45:30,200 --> 02:45:32,293
Who would be dropping by
this afternoon?

2805
02:45:32,369 --> 02:45:33,461
I can't imagine.

2806
02:45:33,536 --> 02:45:35,834
Hardly anybody lives here
anymore.

2807
02:45:39,542 --> 02:45:41,203
The tea will be a moment.

2808
02:45:41,278 --> 02:45:44,304
Mrs. Worth's icing up
a gorgeous chocolate cake.

2809
02:45:47,717 --> 02:45:49,344
Come in, gentlemen.

2810
02:45:49,886 --> 02:45:52,047
Sir, is Mr. Biddle at home?

2811
02:45:52,455 --> 02:45:54,889
Yes.
Will you come this way, please?

2812
02:45:54,958 --> 02:45:57,085
There's some gentlemen
to see you, sir.

2813
02:45:57,160 --> 02:45:58,149
Well, look who's here.

2814
02:45:58,228 --> 02:45:59,286
- Mr. Biddle.
- Lieutenant.

2815
02:45:59,362 --> 02:46:02,297
- Mr. Biddle.
- Good to see you.

2816
02:46:02,365 --> 02:46:05,095
Sir, a set of orders have been
received at our headquarters

2817
02:46:05,168 --> 02:46:07,136
concerning your future relations
with the Corps.

2818
02:46:07,203 --> 02:46:10,570
And we felt that these orders
warranted personal delivery.

2819
02:46:23,586 --> 02:46:24,553
I don't believe it.

2820
02:46:24,621 --> 02:46:25,986
Anthony, what is it?

2821
02:46:26,056 --> 02:46:28,183
When I tried to enlist,
they turned me down.

2822
02:46:28,258 --> 02:46:29,987
Said I was too old
for active service.

2823
02:46:30,060 --> 02:46:31,459
Anthony, for heaven's sake.

2824
02:46:31,528 --> 02:46:34,554
Cordelia, I've been awarded
a provisional captaincy

2825
02:46:34,631 --> 02:46:35,757
in the Marine Corps.

2826
02:46:35,832 --> 02:46:37,697
I'm ordered to report
to Parris Island.

2827
02:46:37,767 --> 02:46:39,257
- Congratulations, sir.
- Thank you.

2828
02:46:39,336 --> 02:46:40,769
Congratulations, Mr. Biddle.

2829
02:46:40,837 --> 02:46:43,101
- John!
- Yes, sir?

2830
02:46:43,506 --> 02:46:44,837
John, we're in the Marines.

2831
02:46:44,908 --> 02:46:46,068
- We are, sir?
- Yes.

2832
02:46:46,142 --> 02:46:48,167
Bring out some of that
good Madeira, will you?

2833
02:46:48,244 --> 02:46:49,575
You know, gentlemen,

2834
02:46:49,646 --> 02:46:52,774
there's something to which I've
been giving a lot of thought.

2835
02:46:52,849 --> 02:46:55,545
The French and the British have
been in this war for some time.

2836
02:46:55,618 --> 02:46:57,848
They must have perfected
close-combat techniques

2837
02:46:57,921 --> 02:46:59,684
which are more realistic
than ours.

2838
02:46:59,756 --> 02:47:02,020
I feel that we ought to send
someone over there

2839
02:47:02,092 --> 02:47:03,457
to observe and learn.

2840
02:47:03,526 --> 02:47:05,824
Anthony, I don't think
that somebody

2841
02:47:05,895 --> 02:47:08,420
who's been in the Marines
for less than five minutes

2842
02:47:08,498 --> 02:47:10,432
should be trying to decide
Corps policy.

2843
02:47:10,500 --> 02:47:12,434
He's sure to end up
running things, Mrs. Biddle.

2844
02:47:12,502 --> 02:47:14,834
He might as well start off
that way.

2845
02:47:15,905 --> 02:47:17,338
Oh, thank you, John.

2846
02:47:17,407 --> 02:47:19,739
You should've brought one
for yourself.

2847
02:47:21,878 --> 02:47:23,607
I'm not much at making speeches.

2848
02:47:23,680 --> 02:47:26,706
But I guess you know
how we all feel about this.

2849
02:47:26,783 --> 02:47:28,114
Mr. Biddle has landed.

2850
02:47:28,184 --> 02:47:30,015
And the Marines are
well in hand.

2851
02:47:30,086 --> 02:47:30,848
Right?

2852
02:47:30,920 --> 02:47:31,511
- Right!
- Right!

2853
02:47:31,588 --> 02:47:33,146
<i>? Well, well, well?</i>

2854
02:47:33,223 --> 02:47:36,090
<i>? "Let's have a drink on it,"
as me father used to say?</i>

2855
