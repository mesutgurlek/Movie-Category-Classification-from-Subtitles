0
00:04:43,365 --> 00:04:45,765
A guitarist like you will not
be able to use this handle!

1
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,836
- Jaggu!
- Coming, brother.

2
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:50,132
You can't even turn the handle,
give it to me.

3
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,007
Get up!

4
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:02,543
You eat 50 'rotis' with cream,
yet lack the strength!

5
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:05,347
- I do eat but...
- There's a problem with the car.

6
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:07,354
- What?! Is the dynamo clean?
- Yes.

7
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,360
- 'Ldli'? Hen?
- Yes.

8
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:15,158
- Harmonium? - Tabla?
- Yes.

9
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:18,366
Why isn't the car starting?

10
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:21,961
Why is the car not starting?

11
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:26,568
I think one of us has seen
a woman, early in the morning.

12
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:30,673
Have you?

13
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,748
No. I saw myself in the mirror.
But Mannu may have.

14
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:35,817
M... m... me?!
I just saw you coming down.

15
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,385
Does that mean, I have?

16
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,388
That girl there is watching us.
No wonder the car is not moving!

17
00:05:41,423 --> 00:05:44,187
Till she keeps looking here,
the car will not start.

18
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:45,984
Get rid of her. Chase her away.

19
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:48,191
- You go.
- You go!

20
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,899
- Should I go?
- Please do so.

21
00:05:52,234 --> 00:05:54,395
No one needs to go.
Let's use our old trick.

22
00:06:09,451 --> 00:06:13,217
The car will now start
and speed away!

23
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:29,233
In the name of Lord Hanuman!

24
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:33,236
The car's gone!

25
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,955
"Move aside"

26
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:52,460
"The honk hoots aloud
So move aside"

27
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:58,456
"What's mobile here
is called a car"

28
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:28,496
"The greatest truth
of all is this"

29
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:32,497
"Come what may
Success will be ours"

30
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:44,501
"In a tattered state it may be
It's fine as long as it's mobile"

31
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:48,014
"True or untrue it may be
It's fine as long as it's mobile"

32
00:07:55,057 --> 00:08:01,018
"Turn to the left
and turn to the right"

33
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,569
"A matter so trivial
The world failed to fathom"

34
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:56,375
"As long as man moves on
Every treasure can be won"

35
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:08,027
"What is fame? To move on
is the name of the game"

36
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,099
"What is honor? To move on
is the name of the game"

37
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:20,668
"Move on together
this way forever"

38
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:24,865
"United we stand,
Divided we fall"

39
00:10:32,714 --> 00:10:36,172
"If problems are strewn your way
With a brave face, challenge it"

40
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:39,686
"If huge hurdles block your way
Together, move it aside"

41
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:53,190
"The one who fathoms this
Achieves success"

42
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,541
- Jaggu, fill oil in this.
- Yes, brother.

43
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,414
Mannu, fill oil.

44
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:46,253
Sir, has our car been repaired?

45
00:11:46,355 --> 00:11:48,255
It's in top condition!
We'll win the race this year too!

46
00:11:48,357 --> 00:11:49,324
Really?

47
00:11:49,424 --> 00:11:51,949
Yes, clean the car
and check the oil.

48
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,756
Certainly... Sir, I
need a holiday tonight.

49
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:55,830
Why?!

50
00:11:55,998 --> 00:11:59,764
Raman Circus from Madras will be
showing good exercises tonight.

51
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:02,769
Some of my friends are going.
I also need Champion, our car.

52
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:04,566
Indeed! Who'll do the work?!

53
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:08,970
I've changed the fuse, filled oil
and cleaned the cars!

54
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:13,781
How awful! Mannu!

55
00:12:13,882 --> 00:12:14,849
Yes?

56
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,975
- Come here.
- Okay... Move aside.

57
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:21,580
Look at this!

58
00:12:21,823 --> 00:12:23,450
It's a lovely picture.

59
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,294
- Did you put it there?
- No. - Then?

60
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:28,295
- I did.
- Why?

61
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:31,798
Our driver Vittal gave it to me.
He told me it was lovely.

62
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,802
I put one here. I'll put the other
with a swimming costume, there.

63
00:12:35,904 --> 00:12:37,371
I'll smash your head! Jaggu!

64
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,602
Coming, brother.

65
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:41,809
- Look at this disgusting picture.
- Awful!

66
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,878
Have you ever seen a woman's
photograph in this house?

67
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:45,810
- Have you?
- No. - No.

68
00:12:45,914 --> 00:12:48,405
If I wanted to put up such a
picture, wouldn't I have done so?

69
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,041
Yes. But why didn't you?

70
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:52,814
Because I don't want anyone
in our home to befriend women!

71
00:12:52,921 --> 00:12:54,548
Nobody should befriend a woman.

72
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:56,624
- Suppose she comes to the garage?
- Suppose it's an emergency?

73
00:12:56,858 --> 00:13:00,419
That's a different case. But burn
this photograph with Mobil Oil!

74
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:03,831
Mannu, burn this photograph
with Mobil Oil.

75
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:07,627
Mojha, burn this photograph
with Mobil Oil.

76
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:12,339
- Boss, will I get an off?
- An off?!

77
00:13:12,441 --> 00:13:14,272
Why did you put the
picture there? I got slapped!

78
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:17,845
I'm sorry, it won't happen again.
May I take Champion?

79
00:13:17,946 --> 00:13:18,913
Go.

80
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:21,346
I'll burn this first.
I've got a holiday!

81
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,851
- You've given Mojha a holiday?
- He wants to go to the circus.

82
00:13:24,953 --> 00:13:27,353
- But who will stay here at night?
- You will.

83
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:30,050
Why should I? You gave him
an off, so you will stay.

84
00:13:30,158 --> 00:13:33,184
No. The day you give him
an off, I'll stay back.

85
00:13:33,295 --> 00:13:35,855
- No, I won't stay.
- I won't stay either!

86
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:37,864
- I won't stay!
- I certainly won't stay!

87
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:38,933
I won't!

88
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:42,993
I'm a deep sleeper. So if a
customer returns, don't complain!

89
00:13:43,105 --> 00:13:46,871
That will bring us disrepute...
It'll fetch all of us a bad name.

90
00:13:46,975 --> 00:13:48,533
Think about it.

91
00:13:48,644 --> 00:13:50,305
- Let's toss.
- Okay.

92
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,879
- Fine?
- Absolutely.

93
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,278
Heads I win, tails you lose.

94
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,884
Heads I win, tails you lose.

95
00:13:56,985 --> 00:13:58,077
Okay.

96
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,889
- Look.
- Tails.

97
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,321
You lose.

98
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,551
Damn!

99
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,893
Heads I win, tails you lose?

100
00:14:34,556 --> 00:14:36,114
Who's it?

101
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,927
Who the hell is it?!

102
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:44,727
Why is he knocking
at this hour?!

103
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:47,935
Hey! Why don't you tell me
who you are?

104
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,733
Just you wait!

105
00:15:01,983 --> 00:15:03,450
What are you looking at!

106
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:05,952
- I thought it was a ghost.
- What!

107
00:15:06,054 --> 00:15:07,885
It's the middle of the night.

108
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,083
I was sleeping so peacefully!

109
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,393
- You were sleeping?
- Yes.

110
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,963
- You were sleeping?!
- Yes, I was.

111
00:15:16,064 --> 00:15:18,555
You were sleeping with the 'Day
and night service' indicator on?!

112
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,467
Is the indicator on?

113
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,768
I will complain about you!

114
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:31,377
The indicator has been turned
off. Now you also buzz off!

115
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,573
Come and complain in the morning.

116
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:41,478
I wonder where she came from! The
girls nowadays are such a pain!

117
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:43,422
Excuse me!

118
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,992
You haven't left as yet?!

119
00:15:45,093 --> 00:15:47,994
Please open the door!
I'm in big trouble.

120
00:15:48,096 --> 00:15:49,393
Very good!

121
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,998
My car has broken down.

122
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:53,397
Get it repaired when you
come to complain tomorrow!

123
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,800
Please! I said that in anger.

124
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,807
Please open the door. I am a
girl. You ought to help me.

125
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:08,011
I ought to help you, indeed!

126
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,018
Have you cooled down, madam?

127
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:14,613
Absolutely? Sure?

128
00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:16,523
Where is the car?

129
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,024
Parked on the road.

130
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,227
The road?

131
00:16:21,062 --> 00:16:23,622
- Where is the driver?
- I, myself, drive.

132
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:27,034
No wonder!
It had to break down!

133
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,230
Come with me.

134
00:16:35,277 --> 00:16:37,040
Come here.

135
00:16:40,882 --> 00:16:42,042
Start.

136
00:16:43,285 --> 00:16:44,843
Once again.

137
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:48,055
I can't figure out this way.

138
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:52,059
- Pardon?
- I can't figure out.

139
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,186
- Then?
- I'll have to open the bonnet.

140
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:56,559
Go ahead!

141
00:16:56,731 --> 00:17:01,566
How can I open it here?
I need light.

142
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,729
You mean, the car has
to be taken to the garage?

143
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,329
Obviously!

144
00:17:06,107 --> 00:17:09,076
- Who will push it?
- That's a good question.

145
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:18,081
I can't see a soul
in these rains.

146
00:17:18,186 --> 00:17:20,279
You're right.
I don't spot a soul.

147
00:17:22,123 --> 00:17:24,091
Push... You push!

148
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:29,095
I knew it! If you can disturb
my sleep at midnight, you can...

149
00:17:29,331 --> 00:17:32,892
Just shut up! Take care of
the steering wheel. I'll push!

150
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:35,694
Really? Let's go.

151
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:38,897
Push, madam.

152
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:42,905
Come on! Push harder!

153
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:44,901
Very good!

154
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:53,712
"A stormy, rainy night it is
Look at the trouble it's brought"

155
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,716
That's enough.

156
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:14,938
It will take some time.
Go and sit somewhere. Go!

157
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:27,143
Oh dear! You're drenched... There
aren't any dry clothes here.

158
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,658
My coat's over there,
you may wear it.

159
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,160
Pardon? No, thank you!

160
00:18:35,196 --> 00:18:36,356
Your wish.

161
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:41,662
Even the car is dripping wet
just like madam!

162
00:18:46,207 --> 00:18:47,970
Where was the misfire?

163
00:18:53,949 --> 00:18:55,177
Oh, so you were misfiring?

164
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:58,682
Look, there's...

165
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,687
...a flask kept. Bring it here.

166
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:03,383
- Me?!
- Yes.

167
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,192
Fetch it yourself!

168
00:19:05,293 --> 00:19:07,193
So you won't go?

169
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:09,320
I am not your servant!

170
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:11,994
Is that so?

171
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:18,938
Even I'm nobody's servant.

172
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,702
The work will be done
only after the flask is brought.

173
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,238
Careful! It will break.

174
00:19:59,881 --> 00:20:02,247
It's hot tea. Just gulp it.

175
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:06,047
- I don't drink tea.
- No? Thank God!

176
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:19,766
Excuse me.

177
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:21,267
Yes?!

178
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:23,667
Please remove a
cigarette from my pocket.

179
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,271
My hands are dirty.
...Remove it.

180
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:36,615
Match stick.

181
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:44,291
- Where is it?
- It's not there?

182
00:20:44,392 --> 00:20:47,293
- Anyway, the cigarettes are wet.
- Serves you right!

183
00:21:02,343 --> 00:21:05,506
She's shivering with cold but
her head has not cooled down yet!

184
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:29,333
"A girl, drenched to the core"

185
00:21:29,437 --> 00:21:33,339
"Wide awake
In the dead of night"

186
00:21:33,441 --> 00:21:37,775
"Met a stranger
With not a soul around"

187
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:41,542
"Is it something
Very wise to do?"

188
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:12,373
"Flames of anger burn
from deep within"

189
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,382
"Seething with rage
She comes"

190
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:32,191
"Fretting and fuming
On a lonely, rainy night"

191
00:23:11,773 --> 00:23:15,436
"Swaying hither and thither"

192
00:23:15,543 --> 00:23:18,444
"Seeming so lost"

193
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:35,258
"With all the zeal
She set out on a night so stormy"

194
00:24:19,107 --> 00:24:22,508
"Soaking wet from head to toe"

195
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:26,307
"She's as crazy as can be"

196
00:24:35,556 --> 00:24:42,018
"She stands, bends, walks, stops
And set out on a night so dark"

197
00:25:12,593 --> 00:25:14,220
Start the car, madam.

198
00:25:21,602 --> 00:25:23,365
That's it!

199
00:25:24,172 --> 00:25:26,766
Sorry for the trouble, madam.
You had to wait long.

200
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:30,372
I have never seen
a man as strange as you.

201
00:25:30,478 --> 00:25:35,074
Well, you have now. People say I
am a bit mad. What do you think?

202
00:25:35,183 --> 00:25:38,380
You, and mad?! You could
make a sane man go insane!

203
00:25:42,623 --> 00:25:44,386
That's nice!

204
00:25:45,626 --> 00:25:47,389
My charges!

205
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,598
She's gone!

206
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:56,592
Cheat! She got the
work done for free!

207
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:07,614
How will she get away now?!

208
00:26:11,652 --> 00:26:13,119
Why is he sleeping here?

209
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,419
Hey, Mannu! Wake up.
Why are you sleeping here?

210
00:26:17,658 --> 00:26:19,819
- What's the time?
- It's 9. Why didn't you go home?

211
00:26:20,461 --> 00:26:24,227
A girl had come last night.
...l'm waiting for her.

212
00:26:24,465 --> 00:26:25,432
What!

213
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:27,634
Fool! Which girl
are you waiting for?!

214
00:26:27,735 --> 00:26:29,635
I mean, it was an emergency case.

215
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,138
She wanted her car repaired.

216
00:26:31,672 --> 00:26:33,139
But why are you waiting for her?

217
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:34,640
She left without paying.

218
00:26:34,742 --> 00:26:36,767
- Were any spare parts used?
- Did she steal anything?

219
00:26:36,878 --> 00:26:39,073
No, but my hard work
went to a waste.

220
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,080
She left her bag behind.
She will surely come back.

221
00:26:41,682 --> 00:26:43,650
It's a nice bag!

222
00:26:44,685 --> 00:26:46,778
- What were the charges?
- Rs.5.75.

223
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:51,955
Remove 5.75 from it and debit the
amount from the company account.

224
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,161
- Very well, brother.
- What's wrong?

225
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:56,230
How can I open the bag
without the girl's permission?

226
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,662
- Nonsense! Obey older brother.
- Remove it.

227
00:26:58,766 --> 00:27:00,461
You open it, brother!

228
00:27:00,768 --> 00:27:02,668
This is not being decent.

229
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:05,671
Absolutely...
What nonsense you talk!

230
00:27:05,773 --> 00:27:07,673
- You open it.
- How can I?

231
00:27:07,775 --> 00:27:10,676
- I never touch a girl's bag.
- I say, open it!

232
00:27:10,778 --> 00:27:14,339
I'm doing it at your behest.
Or I never touch a girl's bag.

233
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,683
- A bullet!
- A bullet?

234
00:27:16,784 --> 00:27:18,684
There may be a revolver.
Hold this!

235
00:27:18,786 --> 00:27:21,186
It's a lipstick,
not a bullet. Look.

236
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:23,689
- It looks just like a bullet.
- Empty the contents.

237
00:27:28,996 --> 00:27:32,124
There's not a single penny.
She made a fool of you, idiot!

238
00:27:34,735 --> 00:27:36,362
A show for an invitation!

239
00:27:36,471 --> 00:27:38,302
An invitation for a show!

240
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:43,135
She will surely go for it.
Return her bag and ask for 5.75.

241
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:48,705
Fine. But I have never seen her.
He's at fault, so he should go.

242
00:27:48,816 --> 00:27:50,716
I understand... You go.

243
00:27:50,818 --> 00:27:51,910
All right.

244
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:55,450
- You also come along.
- No way! I keep away from girls.

245
00:27:55,556 --> 00:27:56,523
Let's toss.

246
00:27:57,758 --> 00:28:00,352
Heads I win, tails you lose.

247
00:28:00,761 --> 00:28:03,389
Hey, you've understood now!

248
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:06,323
Fine, I'll go.

249
00:28:27,788 --> 00:28:31,554
This is a stage pass.
Please go over there.

250
00:28:42,003 --> 00:28:44,369
- Excuse me, is this yours?
- Yes.

251
00:28:44,805 --> 00:28:46,773
- But it's in Ms. Renu's name.
- She's the one I want to meet.

252
00:28:46,874 --> 00:28:48,842
You can't go in without work.

253
00:28:48,943 --> 00:28:50,911
- I have important work with her.
- What work?

254
00:28:51,012 --> 00:28:54,778
- I want my Rs.5.75 from her.
- 5.75! Are you mad?!

255
00:28:55,016 --> 00:28:57,211
- Step out!
- If I don't take my money...

256
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,786
- Wait out until the show is over.
- I can't wait. I...

257
00:28:59,887 --> 00:29:01,787
- Watchman!
- What will he do?

258
00:29:38,859 --> 00:29:44,820
Yes! Where will she go now! I'll
surely take Rs.5.75 from her!

259
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:13,655
O' God! It's 12:15 am.

260
00:30:17,498 --> 00:30:20,296
Bye, Sheela. I must leave.
It's very late.

261
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,665
If the car breaks down again like
last night, I'll be in trouble.

262
00:30:22,903 --> 00:30:25,303
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Come in the morning itself.

263
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,874
You have to spend the entire
day with me. Have lunch and...

264
00:30:27,975 --> 00:30:30,375
- Come shopping as well?
- Yes.

265
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:33,675
- Pray that my car runs fine.
- Yes, I will.

266
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,410
"I'm a melody of the stars
A tale of the springs"

267
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:19,926
"Cast your eye on me
And drive yourself crazy"

268
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:38,935
"Beauty unleashed you sure are
The love of my life you sure are"

269
00:31:39,046 --> 00:31:43,949
"But five rupees and twelve annas
Is what you must pay me first"

270
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:48,444
"Five rupees and twelve annas"

271
00:31:48,989 --> 00:31:51,958
"Else, a thrashing
Brother will give"

272
00:32:03,804 --> 00:32:07,968
"Forget about the money"

273
00:32:08,075 --> 00:32:12,478
"And seek my heart instead"

274
00:32:13,013 --> 00:32:16,779
"My darling, what did you say?"

275
00:32:17,017 --> 00:32:20,976
"Let alone my heart,
seek my youth instead"

276
00:32:21,222 --> 00:32:26,785
"A Romeo I can become for you
'My Juliet' I can chant all day"

277
00:32:27,027 --> 00:32:29,996
"See for yourself
an example of it"

278
00:32:30,831 --> 00:32:35,495
"My blood gets shed for you
My heart gets broken for you"

279
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:47,003
"This is the punishment
a man crazy in your love gets"

280
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:55,010
"This ardent thing called love
Is a feeling, so wonderful"

281
00:32:55,122 --> 00:33:00,025
"Cast your eye on me
And drive yourself crazy"

282
00:33:01,061 --> 00:33:05,521
"This ardent thing called love
Sure is a feeling, so wonderful"

283
00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:10,036
"But five rupees and twelve annas
Is what you must pay me first"

284
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:34,049
"Leave behind your woes
Create a melody instead"

285
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:38,861
"And sing a song of my beauty"

286
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:43,058
"O' my darling"

287
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:47,563
"Continue to make such requests"

288
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:53,076
"A song I can sing for you
A melody I can create for you"

289
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,877
"See for yourself
an example of it"

290
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:05,090
"Tread slowly and deliberately"

291
00:34:05,192 --> 00:34:10,596
"Tread slowly and deliberately
In the garden, O' bee"

292
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,605
"A great admirer of art you are"

293
00:34:18,706 --> 00:34:21,106
"Excuses galore you can make"

294
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:25,838
"Cast your eye on me
And drive yourself crazy"

295
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:31,107
"An excuse so good, it sure is
A great admirer of art I am"

296
00:34:31,218 --> 00:34:35,621
"But five rupees and twelve annas
Is what you must pay me first"

297
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:58,133
"Fall in love
Devoid of any worries"

298
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:02,342
"Money is nothing
But a fleeting possession"

299
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:07,143
"O' my darling,
The truth is what you've spoken"

300
00:35:08,188 --> 00:35:12,147
"Everything else but your love
Is an illusion"

301
00:35:12,259 --> 00:35:16,958
"A recluse I can become for you
And wander the jungles so dense"

302
00:35:17,197 --> 00:35:20,655
"See for yourself
an example of it"

303
00:35:25,205 --> 00:35:29,164
"Your sack is going to burst apart
So beware!

304
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,186
"The love of your life I am"

305
00:35:40,287 --> 00:35:43,188
"Come and embrace me"

306
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:48,193
"Cast your eye on me
And drive yourself crazy"

307
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:53,189
"The love of my life
You sure are"

308
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,202
But first pay me...
One, two, three, four, five..."

309
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:00,398
"Five rupees and twelve annas"

310
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:34,237
Hey, this looks like a garage.

311
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:37,038
But how did I get here?

312
00:36:54,294 --> 00:36:57,058
It's 2 O'clock. O' God!

313
00:37:07,307 --> 00:37:09,775
O' dear! I'm badly trapped!

314
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,847
Hey, who's in there?!

315
00:38:48,408 --> 00:38:53,175
Hey, Ram! Where are you? Get up!
There's a thief in the house!

316
00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:58,373
Get up, Raghu! There's
a thief in the house!

317
00:39:44,464 --> 00:39:46,432
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

318
00:39:46,533 --> 00:39:48,433
Who are you?

319
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:51,937
Oh, it's you!

320
00:39:54,474 --> 00:39:55,941
Where is it?

321
00:39:58,478 --> 00:40:02,039
Here's your bag. And
please show me the way out.

322
00:40:03,483 --> 00:40:04,950
Who are you?!

323
00:40:05,052 --> 00:40:07,111
Didn't you recognise me?

324
00:40:07,487 --> 00:40:11,048
You had come to my garage last
night. I had repaired your car.

325
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:13,459
Yes... Oh yes!

326
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,652
Give 5.75.

327
00:40:14,761 --> 00:40:16,661
- But how did you get here?
- You brought me along?

328
00:40:16,763 --> 00:40:19,459
- What!
- I was sleeping in your car.

329
00:40:19,566 --> 00:40:21,534
In my car? Are you all right?!

330
00:40:21,635 --> 00:40:25,127
No, I'm mad. Or I wouldn't take
the trouble to collect Rs.5.75.

331
00:40:25,505 --> 00:40:27,666
Where is he?
Where has he gone?

332
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:33,479
- Where is the thief?
- I don't know.

333
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,481
You don't know? Do you think
he went this way? Come on.

334
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:41,487
Show me a place to hide.

335
00:40:41,588 --> 00:40:42,987
There's none!

336
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,490
- They will thrash me.
- Good!

337
00:40:45,592 --> 00:40:48,083
You come at midnight
to ask for Rs.5.75!

338
00:40:48,528 --> 00:40:51,497
If you open the door,
I'll tell all of them.

339
00:40:51,598 --> 00:40:54,294
- What?
- That you brought me here.

340
00:40:54,534 --> 00:40:57,094
What! I brought you here!

341
00:40:57,337 --> 00:41:01,000
Yes, you did. Open the door.
I'll tell them everything.

342
00:41:02,943 --> 00:41:05,503
My dear, open the door.

343
00:41:07,547 --> 00:41:10,311
- I... l... l'm coming, father.
- Open the door.

344
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,711
Listen... Wait.

345
00:41:17,157 --> 00:41:18,920
Wait. Let me hide.

346
00:41:21,361 --> 00:41:23,329
Open the door, Renu.

347
00:41:23,563 --> 00:41:25,030
I will.

348
00:41:26,566 --> 00:41:28,124
What's the matter, father?

349
00:41:28,302 --> 00:41:30,327
Are you all right?

350
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:31,969
Absolutely fine.

351
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,539
Then why did you scream?

352
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,200
Me? I didn't scream, father.

353
00:41:36,576 --> 00:41:38,043
But I heard you.

354
00:41:38,145 --> 00:41:40,204
I didn't hear anything.
...I did see, though.

355
00:41:40,314 --> 00:41:43,340
- You did?
- Yes. I had seen a dream.

356
00:41:43,717 --> 00:41:45,685
What is this pistol for?

357
00:41:45,786 --> 00:41:47,549
There's a thief in the house.

358
00:41:47,654 --> 00:41:50,748
There's no one in my room.
I was sleeping peacefully.

359
00:41:50,857 --> 00:41:54,349
How would you know then! He
must be hiding somewhere here.

360
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,562
No, father.

361
00:41:56,663 --> 00:41:59,359
Father, you have
woke up just now.

362
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:02,567
Hey! You heart
is beating so fast!

363
00:42:02,669 --> 00:42:03,761
Is it?

364
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:07,005
- You're very frightened.
- My foot, I am!

365
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:11,373
I'll shoot that thief!
Move aside. Let me take a look.

366
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,080
Why the hell
don't you come out?!

367
00:42:14,614 --> 00:42:16,309
There's nobody here, father.

368
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:19,385
I wonder where he's gone!

369
00:42:23,623 --> 00:42:25,090
What a problem...

370
00:42:25,192 --> 00:42:27,092
- You'll break the legs.
- Legs?

371
00:42:27,194 --> 00:42:29,094
Those of the bed. They're weak.

372
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:34,088
Father, I think
he's hiding on the roof.

373
00:42:34,201 --> 00:42:36,260
I'll shoot him!

374
00:42:36,636 --> 00:42:39,605
- On the terrace.
- Oh, I'll go there.

375
00:42:39,706 --> 00:42:43,039
Lock your door. And don't worry.

376
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:46,601
Come with me, everyone.

377
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:06,425
I'm going. Let's me catch
my breath. My back is broken.

378
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:13,139
Thief!

379
00:45:43,823 --> 00:45:48,590
After that, I remained in the
midst of beggars for a long time.

380
00:45:48,828 --> 00:45:52,594
I could leave only after the cops
came and took the corpse away.

381
00:45:52,699 --> 00:45:55,793
The story is very good!
I have surely read it before.

382
00:45:55,902 --> 00:45:58,803
Indeed! Had you been in my place,
you would have known!

383
00:45:58,905 --> 00:46:00,873
- The question that now arises...
- The question that now arises...

384
00:46:00,974 --> 00:46:05,377
...is that as per the law, you
should tell the cops everything.

385
00:46:05,478 --> 00:46:07,446
But it was the police
who took the dead body away.

386
00:46:07,847 --> 00:46:11,248
Yes, it could mean more trouble.
That's why I'm quiet. However...

387
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,319
You couldn't get Rs.5.75.

388
00:46:13,853 --> 00:46:16,822
- I couldn't. So?
- So I say, keep away from women!

389
00:46:16,923 --> 00:46:20,450
Don't repair their cars. You can't
please them. They are cheats.

390
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,327
Yes, all of them are.

391
00:46:22,429 --> 00:46:24,158
Wrong! Not all girls are cheats!

392
00:46:24,264 --> 00:46:26,824
How do you know that
this girl isn't a cheat?

393
00:46:26,933 --> 00:46:28,400
She will pay us.

394
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:29,832
- Did she say so?
- Yes.

395
00:46:29,936 --> 00:46:31,460
- When?
- At 2 O'clock at night.

396
00:46:31,571 --> 00:46:33,835
She'll come to pay at 2 a.m.,
and we'll keep waiting!

397
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:37,376
I mean, she told me that
she would come this morning.

398
00:46:37,477 --> 00:46:39,274
- At what time?
- At 10 O'clock.

399
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,846
- 10 O'clock?
- Between 10 - 10.30.

400
00:46:40,947 --> 00:46:45,281
Rubbish! I shouldn't have sent
you! You get excited seeing girls!

401
00:46:45,885 --> 00:46:47,853
- I get excited?!
- Go and do your work!

402
00:46:47,954 --> 00:46:49,444
Go and do your work.

403
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:53,219
How often have I told him not
to get excited on seeing girls!

404
00:46:53,326 --> 00:46:55,294
To concentrate on his work!

405
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,862
And you play!

406
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,876
- What is it?!
- Nothing.

407
00:47:12,512 --> 00:47:15,675
- Are you angry with me?
- No. Why?

408
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:20,875
May I ask something? Did you
actually fall on the girl?

409
00:47:20,987 --> 00:47:22,454
I told you I did.

410
00:47:22,555 --> 00:47:25,319
You did? In that case,
the girl is very nice.

411
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,892
How do you know?

412
00:47:26,993 --> 00:47:29,689
Wouldn't she have handed
you over to the police otherwise?

413
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:33,398
How does she look?

414
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,695
- Very beautiful!
- Really?

415
00:47:39,939 --> 00:47:41,406
How old is she?

416
00:47:41,508 --> 00:47:42,907
60 years!

417
00:47:43,009 --> 00:47:46,035
What! She's old.

418
00:47:46,146 --> 00:47:47,909
Don't joke. How old is she?

419
00:47:48,014 --> 00:47:50,107
Damn! She must be
around 20-22 years.

420
00:47:50,216 --> 00:47:52,411
20-22 years! Very good!

421
00:47:53,153 --> 00:47:56,418
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Nothing. Introduce me to her.

422
00:47:57,357 --> 00:48:01,418
In front of brother, you scold
me! And now, ask me about girls!

423
00:48:01,528 --> 00:48:04,725
I'm dead! Help me, sir!

424
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:07,428
Help!

425
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:09,331
Hey, why are you hitting him?

426
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,937
I asked him to paint my car black
but he painted my face instead.

427
00:48:12,038 --> 00:48:13,437
I'll hit him!

428
00:48:13,773 --> 00:48:15,400
Stop it, you fool!

429
00:48:38,198 --> 00:48:42,464
You wanted to fight with me!
Get up! Fight!

430
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:49,641
Brother!

431
00:48:50,009 --> 00:48:51,977
You act smart
with children, huh?!

432
00:48:52,078 --> 00:48:54,410
Mojha accidentally
sprayed paint over his face.

433
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:57,244
He beat him so badly that the
poor chap began to see stars!

434
00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:59,978
- So I hit him...
- A musician like you, and hit?!

435
00:49:00,086 --> 00:49:03,419
But you! You eat 50 'rotis',
yet lack the strength!

436
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,491
Brother, I did try.
But he is strong.

437
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:07,992
Why don't you show your might?

438
00:49:09,229 --> 00:49:12,392
Brother, knock him out!

439
00:49:14,033 --> 00:49:15,432
- Come on!
- Really?

440
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,503
Brother, just one powerful punch!

441
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:36,021
Do you see stars already?!

442
00:49:42,228 --> 00:49:44,628
Now I will make you see stars!

443
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,248
Ask him how many stars
he can see!

444
00:50:08,087 --> 00:50:09,850
Ask him how many stars
he can see!

445
00:50:19,098 --> 00:50:20,793
- Send him to the hospital.
- The hospital?

446
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:21,867
Yes!

447
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:26,561
Heave ho! Heave ho!

448
00:50:53,132 --> 00:50:57,091
It's 10:30... He said she'd
bring the money at 10:30.

449
00:50:57,203 --> 00:50:59,103
My foot, she'll bring!

450
00:51:18,157 --> 00:51:21,718
There's dirt in the carburetor
and the brakes aren't proper too.

451
00:51:22,161 --> 00:51:24,652
Pay your previous dues first.
Only then will I do the next job.

452
00:51:24,764 --> 00:51:26,755
- Previous dues?
- Yes. Rs.5.75.

453
00:51:26,866 --> 00:51:29,130
But I have come here
for the first time.

454
00:51:29,235 --> 00:51:31,135
- Really?
- Yes.

455
00:51:33,172 --> 00:51:35,936
Look, you can fool Mannu
but I'm very smart.

456
00:51:36,042 --> 00:51:38,135
Who's Mannu?
I don't know any Mannu.

457
00:51:38,244 --> 00:51:40,144
- So you don't even know Mannu?
- No.

458
00:51:40,246 --> 00:51:43,340
He had repaired your car and was
at your place at 2 last night.

459
00:51:43,449 --> 00:51:44,746
- Brother!
- Shut up!

460
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:47,342
He came to my place at 2 a. M!
What do you think I am?!

461
00:51:47,453 --> 00:51:49,580
What do you think we are? Do you
expect us to work free for you?

462
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,156
Pay up or I'll call the police!

463
00:51:51,257 --> 00:51:54,658
- Brother!
- Quiet! Will you pay Rs.5.75?!

464
00:51:54,761 --> 00:51:57,161
- This is some compulsion! Rs.5...
- What! Didn't he work for it?

465
00:51:57,263 --> 00:51:59,663
- How much was it?
- Rs.5.75.

466
00:51:59,766 --> 00:52:01,666
- That's what I'm asking for.
- But, brother...

467
00:52:02,201 --> 00:52:03,759
Rs.5.75.

468
00:52:04,203 --> 00:52:06,171
Here, take this.

469
00:52:06,406 --> 00:52:10,172
Return 25 paise. And here
is your receipt. Keep this.

470
00:52:10,276 --> 00:52:13,109
What a problem!
Give me 25 paise.

471
00:52:18,217 --> 00:52:20,811
- Yes?
- Is it Manmohan?

472
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,785
No. I'm his older brother.

473
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:25,756
Could you please call Manmohan?

474
00:52:27,026 --> 00:52:30,985
There's a girl for you...
I'm his older brother. He's busy.

475
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:33,630
I am calling from
Mr. Kishanchand's bungalow.

476
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,701
Manmohan had repaired
my car earlier also.

477
00:52:35,835 --> 00:52:37,928
- When?
- Day-before-yesterday night.

478
00:52:38,237 --> 00:52:40,705
- At 2 a. M?
- Yes. It's broken down again.

479
00:52:40,807 --> 00:52:43,799
- So, you had to pay Rs.5.75?
- That's right.

480
00:52:44,043 --> 00:52:46,705
Damn! I charged some
other girl for it. This is...

481
00:52:46,813 --> 00:52:50,010
I'm sorry... I wasn't talking
to you. What work do you have?

482
00:52:50,249 --> 00:52:53,218
- My car has broken down again.
- Fine. I'll send somebody.

483
00:52:57,957 --> 00:53:00,824
Are you convinced now that I've
come here for the first time?!

484
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:05,728
I'm extremely sorry. Please sit.
Your car will be repaired.

485
00:53:05,832 --> 00:53:08,027
- Here.
- Thank you.

486
00:53:14,273 --> 00:53:17,242
- Why didn't you tell me?!
- You never gave me a chance!

487
00:53:17,343 --> 00:53:20,676
It wasn't the same girl
but her bag looked so similar.

488
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,248
That's where even I went wrong.
Well, never mind.

489
00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:26,682
Go to Peddar Road and repair
Kishanchand's girl's car.

490
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:27,753
Girl!

491
00:53:27,854 --> 00:53:30,254
He can't collect the money,
so it's no use sending him!

492
00:53:30,356 --> 00:53:36,056
I never visit a girl's house but
since you say... fine, I'll go.

493
00:53:39,298 --> 00:53:40,765
Listen.

494
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,767
Clean the carburetor of her car.
Repair her brakes too.

495
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:46,668
Repair everything.
But don't charge her.

496
00:53:46,773 --> 00:53:49,264
- Why?
- I messed up. And insulted her.

497
00:54:18,337 --> 00:54:21,306
The engine is fine.
I wonder what's wrong.

498
00:54:21,407 --> 00:54:25,503
I'd repaired it this morning.
I think there's a problem here.

499
00:54:25,945 --> 00:54:27,708
I wonder what's wrong.

500
00:54:29,348 --> 00:54:31,816
- Who are you?
- Why have you come here?

501
00:54:31,918 --> 00:54:34,318
- Someone had called for me.
- Who had?

502
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:37,753
I don't know.
Perhaps it was one of you.

503
00:54:38,357 --> 00:54:39,824
I don't know who he is!

504
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,828
Mister, you've come
to the wrong house.

505
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:48,128
How can that be? This was the
address given over the phone.

506
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:54,339
- Oh? Are you from the garage?
- That's right.

507
00:54:56,375 --> 00:54:58,343
But the one who had
repaired my car...

508
00:54:58,444 --> 00:55:00,139
Is my younger brother.

509
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:03,348
- Why didn't he come?
- What could he have done?

510
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:06,612
He's only a mechanic.
I am an automobile engineer.

511
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:10,348
Well, Mr. Engineer, how long
will you take to repair the car?

512
00:55:10,456 --> 00:55:12,356
I'll have to look at it first.

513
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:13,425
Go ahead.

514
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,360
Renu dear!

515
00:55:15,461 --> 00:55:17,554
- Repair the car quickly.
- Very well.

516
00:55:24,403 --> 00:55:25,802
What's wrong?

517
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:28,373
If you would step aside,
I'd be able to work better.

518
00:55:28,474 --> 00:55:30,169
Oh? Go ahead.

519
00:55:34,413 --> 00:55:36,176
Please hurry up!

520
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:39,384
Hey, don't! There's
nothing wrong with it.

521
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,047
Then, there must be
a problem with the plug.

522
00:55:43,422 --> 00:55:47,381
The plug is fine. The battery is
charged. I've checked everything.

523
00:55:47,493 --> 00:55:49,461
- There may be a problem beneath.
- Beneath?

524
00:55:49,562 --> 00:55:51,393
Yes. Take a look.

525
00:55:51,497 --> 00:55:52,464
Okay.

526
00:55:55,434 --> 00:55:57,402
- Why are you staring at me?
- It's nothing.

527
00:55:57,503 --> 00:55:59,471
There's a black mark on the face.

528
00:55:59,572 --> 00:56:00,732
Black mark?

529
00:56:03,442 --> 00:56:05,410
- Wipe it off.
- M... m... me?

530
00:56:05,511 --> 00:56:07,206
Yes, wipe it off.

531
00:56:09,448 --> 00:56:11,416
Hey! Why are you so nervous?

532
00:56:11,517 --> 00:56:14,213
I... l... l'm not nervous.

533
00:56:14,453 --> 00:56:16,853
Please get me a glass of water.

534
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:20,414
Water? Fine, I'll get it.
But at least go down and check.

535
00:56:20,526 --> 00:56:22,824
- I'll go right now.
- Quickly.

536
00:56:27,466 --> 00:56:30,162
Whom have you sent?! He's still
not been able to repair the car.

537
00:56:30,269 --> 00:56:32,237
He's had 10 glasses of water!

538
00:56:32,471 --> 00:56:35,099
- What!
- Yes! Please send Manmohan.

539
00:56:35,274 --> 00:56:37,242
All right. I'll send
somebody else. Don't worry.

540
00:56:39,912 --> 00:56:41,641
Mannu... come here.

541
00:56:42,682 --> 00:56:44,445
Jaggu can't repair the car.
So you go.

542
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:46,040
No. I have work to do.

543
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:49,451
It's beyond him. He's had
10 glasses of water already.

544
00:56:49,555 --> 00:56:51,887
- 10 glasses of water!
- Yes. Go there.

545
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,458
- I'm taking the car.
- Okay.

546
00:57:10,109 --> 00:57:12,475
- Hasn't the car got repaired yet?
- No, it hasn't.

547
00:57:12,578 --> 00:57:13,977
Is that car yours?

548
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,480
That one? It's ours.

549
00:57:16,582 --> 00:57:18,072
It looks very strange.

550
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:21,278
Strange? It's a racing car!
A 1921 model.

551
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,681
- May I take a look at it?
- Sure!

552
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:26,491
Excuse me. My elder brother had
come from the garage. Where's he?

553
00:57:26,592 --> 00:57:28,560
- He's beneath.
- Beneath?

554
00:57:29,528 --> 00:57:32,691
Brother Jaggu!
Hey, what's the matter?

555
00:57:33,099 --> 00:57:36,000
I am stuck! Please get me out.

556
00:57:40,539 --> 00:57:42,939
- Has the girl gone?
- Yes, she has.

557
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:46,500
- But how did you land there?
- Don't ask! She pushed me in.

558
00:57:46,612 --> 00:57:48,512
- How?
- I'll tell you later.

559
00:57:48,614 --> 00:57:50,514
- Have you got the car?
- Yes, I have.

560
00:57:50,616 --> 00:57:52,311
I'm leaving.

561
00:57:52,952 --> 00:57:56,319
And listen. Get Rs.5.75 yourself.
I'm going!

562
00:57:56,555 --> 00:57:58,523
- Brother Jaggu!
- I'm going!

563
00:58:09,568 --> 00:58:12,537
Good God! What an escape!

564
00:58:12,638 --> 00:58:16,540
"Fortunate am I
For having being able to escape"

565
00:58:23,582 --> 00:58:25,550
Hey! Where are you taking me?

566
00:58:25,651 --> 00:58:27,812
Who spoke? There's no one here.

567
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,047
Where are you taking me away?

568
00:58:30,589 --> 00:58:31,556
You!

569
00:58:31,657 --> 00:58:33,352
Watch! There could be an accident!

570
00:58:36,595 --> 00:58:38,358
What's happening?!

571
00:58:46,605 --> 00:58:47,765
Listen!

572
00:58:52,178 --> 00:58:54,373
Excuse me!

573
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:12,393
Excuse me! Please wait!

574
00:59:15,434 --> 00:59:18,198
Please listen to me!
...Please wait!

575
00:59:29,648 --> 00:59:32,617
I'm tired. I can't run anymore.

576
00:59:32,718 --> 00:59:34,686
Fine. Then sit in the car.

577
00:59:34,787 --> 00:59:38,052
In the car? But how can
I sit in the car with you?

578
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:39,624
Why not? Am I a tigress?

579
00:59:39,725 --> 00:59:43,126
Well, I don't know that.
But you surely are something!

580
00:59:43,229 --> 00:59:45,629
Come on, just get into the car.

581
00:59:45,731 --> 00:59:46,823
Come.

582
00:59:49,668 --> 00:59:51,898
Where do I have to go now?

583
00:59:52,004 --> 00:59:53,835
- Reach me home.
- Your home!

584
00:59:55,274 --> 00:59:57,242
Dear God, what trouble
have You landed me in!

585
00:59:57,343 --> 01:00:00,574
- What!
- No! I was talking to myself.

586
01:00:00,679 --> 01:00:01,839
Let's go.

587
01:00:13,692 --> 01:00:16,160
- When did you come?
- A while back.

588
01:00:16,262 --> 01:00:18,787
- You didn't even inform me.
- I was repairing the car.

589
01:00:18,898 --> 01:00:21,162
- Is it done?
- Yes. It was an easy job!

590
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,668
Your brother couldn't manage.

591
01:00:23,769 --> 01:00:25,100
- He was nervous.
- Why?

592
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:26,671
He's a bit afraid of girls.

593
01:00:26,906 --> 01:00:31,673
I was worried the whole night.
I kept running everywhere.

594
01:00:31,777 --> 01:00:34,177
At the end of it, I got so tired.

595
01:00:35,014 --> 01:00:37,482
Why has the
police inspector come here?

596
01:00:38,717 --> 01:00:42,118
Because a thief had
entered our house last night.

597
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:43,688
Have you told them?

598
01:00:43,789 --> 01:00:49,489
He didn't steal anything. He
only ate 3 bananas and 2 apples.

599
01:00:50,529 --> 01:00:53,430
I suspect he was a member
of a gang of murderers.

600
01:00:53,532 --> 01:00:54,897
- What!
- Yes.

601
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:59,136
A famous jeweler named Lalchand
was murdered nearby last night.

602
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:01,206
We found his
dead body on the road.

603
01:01:01,307 --> 01:01:03,275
Before we could get there,
the rogue escaped.

604
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:06,367
It's possible, one of the gang
members had entered your house.

605
01:01:06,745 --> 01:01:10,704
Good God! In that case,
search the place well.

606
01:01:10,816 --> 01:01:12,909
Because the hoodlum
has seen my house.

607
01:01:13,018 --> 01:01:17,216
Don't worry. It's a murder case.
I'll take special care.

608
01:01:17,323 --> 01:01:19,223
Thank you very much.

609
01:01:19,325 --> 01:01:22,726
In the meantime, I'll go and
keep the jewelry in the bank.

610
01:01:22,828 --> 01:01:25,319
- Is the car all right?
- Yes, daddy.

611
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:28,229
Wait. Let me first
interrogate your driver.

612
01:01:28,334 --> 01:01:32,293
But you've held the driver and
my other servants in custody.

613
01:01:32,404 --> 01:01:34,065
Then who's he?

614
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:35,934
- Who are you?
- Well, I am...

615
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:38,168
He is the mechanic...
He had come to repair the car.

616
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:39,244
Indeed.

617
01:01:39,345 --> 01:01:41,540
Have you come here before?

618
01:01:41,981 --> 01:01:43,744
Never.

619
01:01:43,849 --> 01:01:46,750
I'll question
your servants at home.

620
01:01:46,852 --> 01:01:51,346
Investigate well. Inspector,
the hoodlum must be caught.

621
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:54,258
- Renu, who will drive the car?
- I will.

622
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:59,297
I have the jewelry with me. What
if the car breaks down again?

623
01:01:59,398 --> 01:02:01,423
- Let's take him along.
- Yes, I'll come.

624
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,563
- Come on.
- Let's go.

625
01:02:20,819 --> 01:02:22,787
Your car doesn't
knock now, does it?

626
01:02:22,888 --> 01:02:24,583
- No.
- How can it?

627
01:02:24,823 --> 01:02:28,782
My adept hands, and fail? No
company has made such a car!

628
01:02:28,894 --> 01:02:31,795
Race... Faster!
Accelerate some more!

629
01:02:31,897 --> 01:02:34,798
Faster, indeed! Suppose
there's an accident, then?!

630
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:37,801
Since the time the thief entered
our house, I've been jittery.

631
01:02:37,903 --> 01:02:40,804
- Did a thief actually get in?
- Am I lying then!

632
01:02:40,906 --> 01:02:43,238
- What did he steal?
- That's most surprising.

633
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:45,310
He didn't steal a thing.

634
01:02:45,411 --> 01:02:50,314
How could he? He didn't come to
steal. He wanted to take Rs.5...

635
01:02:50,849 --> 01:02:52,612
- What happened, son?
- What's wrong?

636
01:02:52,851 --> 01:02:54,819
- You were talking about Rs.5?
- Nothing.

637
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:58,822
I think he was a
blessed saint, not a thief.

638
01:02:58,924 --> 01:03:03,827
No wonder he ate 3 bananas
and 2 apples... 5 fruits in all.

639
01:03:03,929 --> 01:03:05,453
What do you think?

640
01:03:05,864 --> 01:03:08,424
I think he is crazy.

641
01:03:08,867 --> 01:03:10,334
What's happened to you now?

642
01:03:10,436 --> 01:03:13,269
Nothing, daddy. My foot slipped.

643
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:18,275
Be careful, child. Let me keep
the jewelry safely in the bank.

644
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:20,641
What a pain!
She wants to drive, indeed!

645
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,368
Why did you talk about the thief
in front of daddy?

646
01:03:44,903 --> 01:03:48,361
You were about to say everything.
You are really mad!

647
01:03:48,907 --> 01:03:52,866
You haven't seen madness yet.
You must meet my brothers first.

648
01:03:52,978 --> 01:03:56,072
I pale out in comparison!

649
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,883
The one who came this morning
and had 10 glasses of water...

650
01:03:58,984 --> 01:04:01,885
He's Brother Jaggu,
the middle one.

651
01:04:01,987 --> 01:04:05,479
An electrical engineer. But he's
ignorant about electrical works.

652
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:11,886
He does discuss girls but gets
jittery when he faces them!

653
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:19,904
And what about you?

654
01:04:20,005 --> 01:04:23,304
Me? L'm the opposite.

655
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:24,409
What?

656
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:26,510
Girls are afraid of me.

657
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:32,713
You know the state
you were in last night!

658
01:04:33,652 --> 01:04:35,916
Don't laugh. You're too much!

659
01:04:36,021 --> 01:04:39,422
Should you have done that
just to collect Rs. 5.75?

660
01:04:39,525 --> 01:04:40,924
I had no choice.

661
01:04:41,026 --> 01:04:44,928
Had I not come, my eldest brother
would have thrashed me badly.

662
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:48,932
And specially, bills of girls!
...No way!

663
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:51,936
Why? What wrong have girls done?

664
01:04:52,037 --> 01:04:55,734
I don't know.
But yes, he does hate them.

665
01:04:56,975 --> 01:05:00,934
He even hates their pictures.

666
01:05:01,046 --> 01:05:05,005
He instructs us not to talk to
them, not to repair their cars.

667
01:05:05,117 --> 01:05:09,144
And was he the one who sent you
to collect Rs.5.75 at 2 a. M?

668
01:05:09,388 --> 01:05:10,753
Obviously.

669
01:05:11,256 --> 01:05:12,746
Hey! Where are you going?

670
01:05:12,991 --> 01:05:15,960
- To reach you to your garage.
- Please don't that!

671
01:05:16,061 --> 01:05:18,962
If my elder brother sees me
with you, he'll kill me.

672
01:05:19,064 --> 01:05:21,760
Give me the money,
I'll get off here.

673
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,959
Mannu, I'll pay the money
only to him.

674
01:05:26,572 --> 01:05:28,767
And I will also see
how much he hates girls.

675
01:05:29,007 --> 01:05:32,170
That's your problem.
But please let me get off here.

676
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:35,173
Please stop the car!
Look...

677
01:05:38,183 --> 01:05:39,775
All right. Drive on.

678
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:42,384
- What happened?
- Nothing.

679
01:05:42,488 --> 01:05:46,618
It's 12 O'clock. He won't be
in the garage now. Drive on.

680
01:05:50,028 --> 01:05:50,995
That's it.

681
01:06:15,053 --> 01:06:16,816
- In love?
- Yes.

682
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:38,031
"I was there, and so was she
She was there, and so was l"

683
01:06:39,077 --> 01:06:40,544
"I was there, and so was she"

684
01:06:40,646 --> 01:06:42,614
"The settings too were lovely;
You know what I mean"

685
01:06:43,081 --> 01:06:46,482
"Reached a place I never meant
to go; you know what I mean"

686
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:50,851
"lmplying, in love I am!"

687
01:07:25,123 --> 01:07:28,820
"How I got lost in her words"

688
01:07:28,927 --> 01:07:32,488
"I'll tell you about it
But let me catch my breath"

689
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:36,533
"How she got lost in my words"

690
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:40,594
"I'll tell you about it
But let me catch my breath"

691
01:07:41,139 --> 01:07:44,540
"Messages aplenty
were conveyed through the eyes"

692
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:48,909
"I'll tell you about it
But let me catch my breath"

693
01:08:02,327 --> 01:08:06,627
"Mannu, love has struck you
But what about me now?"

694
01:08:25,183 --> 01:08:29,142
"Two eyes fluttered so fast"

695
01:08:29,254 --> 01:08:32,655
"When she turned behind
To look at me"

696
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:36,350
"As though she was telling me,
'Listen to me, young lad"'

697
01:08:36,995 --> 01:08:39,964
"When I turned behind
To look at her"

698
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:44,566
"Two hearts
Then began to beat so fast"

699
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:48,662
"When both of us turned behind
To look at each other"

700
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:06,680
"Mannu, love has struck you
But what about me now?"

701
01:09:25,243 --> 01:09:28,701
"Just a little"

702
01:09:29,247 --> 01:09:32,705
"Just a little slowly
She pulled"

703
01:09:33,251 --> 01:09:39,212
"Then her sari,
Just a little slowly I pulled"

704
01:09:41,259 --> 01:09:44,717
"From sheer nervousness then,
Our hands"

705
01:09:45,263 --> 01:09:48,721
"Our hands, we pulled"

706
01:10:09,287 --> 01:10:10,914
Is all this true?

707
01:10:15,293 --> 01:10:17,261
All of it is a lie!

708
01:10:19,798 --> 01:10:24,258
When Renu gets married,
you'll long to eat such food.

709
01:10:24,369 --> 01:10:26,064
You're absolutely right.

710
01:10:26,304 --> 01:10:29,762
My dear, have you
heard of King Hardayal?

711
01:10:33,311 --> 01:10:35,779
- Why?
- He is coming home tomorrow.

712
01:10:35,881 --> 01:10:39,078
- Why?
- To meet you.

713
01:10:39,317 --> 01:10:41,785
His younger brother,
Prince Prakashchand...

714
01:10:41,887 --> 01:10:44,287
...will be returning
to India in some days.

715
01:10:44,389 --> 01:10:45,856
He may be!

716
01:10:45,957 --> 01:10:49,290
Hardayal says that
the boy is brilliant.

717
01:10:49,394 --> 01:10:52,795
He looks good,
and is good-natured too.

718
01:10:52,898 --> 01:10:54,092
Maybe.

719
01:10:54,332 --> 01:10:57,699
I think he's worthy
of you in every respect.

720
01:10:57,936 --> 01:11:02,100
Of me? So, were you
discussing my marriage?

721
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:05,503
Obviously! Uncle wants you
to become a princess.

722
01:11:07,345 --> 01:11:08,812
So, have you fixed the marriage?

723
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:13,110
No, my child. How can I
fix it without your consent?

724
01:11:13,351 --> 01:11:15,751
Meet Prakash first.

725
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:18,322
If you like him,
then give your consent.

726
01:11:18,423 --> 01:11:20,755
But what's the hurry, father?

727
01:11:20,859 --> 01:11:25,125
If your mother were alive, she'd
have got you married 4 years ago!

728
01:11:25,864 --> 01:11:28,332
Father, I will not
marry a prince.

729
01:11:28,433 --> 01:11:29,900
Meet him first.

730
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:32,765
I'm sure he will have all
the qualities that I dislike.

731
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:34,338
He may not have them either.

732
01:11:34,439 --> 01:11:36,839
All rich people
possess airs and false pride.

733
01:11:37,008 --> 01:11:39,340
- But you don't.
- Well said!

734
01:11:39,444 --> 01:11:43,346
Explain to your friend. I'll go
and have a digestive pill.

735
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:54,347
You must be thrilled,
hearing about the prince?

736
01:12:03,902 --> 01:12:06,769
You look as though
you're really angry.

737
01:12:06,872 --> 01:12:07,861
I am!

738
01:12:07,973 --> 01:12:09,770
- I understand.
- My foot, you do!

739
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:12,172
"Uncle wants you
to become a princess!"

740
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:16,369
Fine. I'll tell uncle
that a prince won't do.

741
01:12:16,481 --> 01:12:18,881
He should get you married
to a king instead!

742
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:21,814
You talk of marriage all the
time! Why are you after me?!

743
01:12:21,887 --> 01:12:24,378
Why don't you
get married instead?!

744
01:12:24,489 --> 01:12:29,893
O' God! I always keep dreaming
about it! When I'll get married?

745
01:12:31,429 --> 01:12:34,193
Shall I tell you?
...Marry the prince.

746
01:12:34,432 --> 01:12:36,900
Nonsense! Even I don't like him.

747
01:12:37,002 --> 01:12:41,200
- Whom would you like?
- I like someone round.

748
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,203
- Round?
- It'll be nice, won't it?

749
01:12:44,442 --> 01:12:47,900
And he should be
a little dim-witted too.

750
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:49,914
Why?

751
01:12:50,015 --> 01:12:53,416
Because the shrewd boys nowadays
will not come in your clutches.

752
01:12:54,019 --> 01:12:58,422
I want a hen-pecked husband.

753
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:02,426
I think you already have
some dim-witted boy in mind?

754
01:13:02,661 --> 01:13:05,425
There are many. In fact, it's
getting difficult to select.

755
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:08,432
It's your turn now.

756
01:13:08,533 --> 01:13:09,932
Shall I tell you?

757
01:13:11,469 --> 01:13:13,027
Not now.

758
01:13:45,503 --> 01:13:48,472
- Where is everyone?
- It's the day off. No work today.

759
01:13:50,709 --> 01:13:53,473
- Where is Mannu?
- All of them are sleeping.

760
01:13:54,112 --> 01:13:56,672
- They are still sleeping?!
- They will wake up at 12.

761
01:13:57,515 --> 01:13:59,881
Just shut up!
What impertinence is this!

762
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:02,486
I have important work with Mannu.

763
01:14:02,587 --> 01:14:06,489
Go upstairs and take a left.
Mr. Mannu is sleeping there.

764
01:14:49,567 --> 01:14:50,727
Wake up.

765
01:15:01,179 --> 01:15:03,545
Did anybody see you?
How did you reach here?

766
01:15:03,648 --> 01:15:05,616
Just the way
you reached my house.

767
01:15:05,717 --> 01:15:08,151
- I got there by mistake.
- Even I got here by mistake.

768
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:11,552
If my brothers see you,
I'll be in deep trouble!

769
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:14,058
Are they also yet sleeping?!

770
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,354
Yes. Now's the chance,
so please leave!

771
01:15:17,595 --> 01:15:19,290
I came to give Rs 5.75.

772
01:15:19,597 --> 01:15:21,895
Forget the charges! Please go!

773
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:27,063
Why? When you'd come to my place,
...you had created such a racket!

774
01:15:27,605 --> 01:15:30,165
Rs.5.75... I shall
surely give today!

775
01:15:36,614 --> 01:15:38,377
I'll be dead!

776
01:15:40,118 --> 01:15:43,087
Help! Help!!

777
01:15:44,422 --> 01:15:46,583
Help me, Mannu!

778
01:15:49,627 --> 01:15:51,094
- What happened?
- Something disastrous!

779
01:15:51,429 --> 01:15:55,593
A... a lad... I mean,
a lass barged into my room!

780
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:57,600
- Which lass?
- The petrol lass.

781
01:15:57,702 --> 01:16:00,398
- The petrol lass?
- She is in my room right now!

782
01:16:14,252 --> 01:16:15,617
Excuse me.

783
01:16:16,654 --> 01:16:19,623
I'll take the tea. You may leave.

784
01:16:36,074 --> 01:16:37,439
Tea.

785
01:16:48,686 --> 01:16:51,849
I knew you would
surely come someday.

786
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,861
I've been waiting for you
since so long.

787
01:17:00,999 --> 01:17:03,263
Are you asleep or awake?

788
01:17:07,305 --> 01:17:08,465
Tea.

789
01:17:09,707 --> 01:17:11,470
What's the time?

790
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:13,268
9 O'clock.

791
01:17:13,378 --> 01:17:16,472
You woke me very early.
Break my knuckles.

792
01:17:17,715 --> 01:17:19,182
Come on!

793
01:17:26,024 --> 01:17:28,424
You aren't doing it right!
Never mind.

794
01:17:28,526 --> 01:17:30,892
- Massage my back.
- No!

795
01:17:31,529 --> 01:17:32,894
Why not?

796
01:17:41,739 --> 01:17:45,698
Why are you shouting?
I had come to pay the bill.

797
01:17:45,810 --> 01:17:48,370
- Which bill?
- For repairing my car.

798
01:17:48,546 --> 01:17:51,515
- Who are you?
- I am Renu.

799
01:17:51,749 --> 01:17:55,515
Renu? Who's Renu?
...Where are you from?

800
01:17:55,753 --> 01:17:58,517
Jaggu, there's a girl in my room!

801
01:17:58,957 --> 01:18:01,517
Run... Hide!

802
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,385
- Don't move.
- I won't.

803
01:18:04,762 --> 01:18:06,730
Please move away.

804
01:18:15,773 --> 01:18:18,241
- Get up! It's unbelievable!
- What happened?

805
01:18:18,343 --> 01:18:20,311
There's someone
named Renu in my room.

806
01:18:20,778 --> 01:18:23,246
- Renu is a girl!
- A girl!

807
01:18:23,348 --> 01:18:24,940
- I don't know her.
- Me neither.

808
01:18:25,049 --> 01:18:27,483
But how did
a girl get into my room?

809
01:18:27,585 --> 01:18:29,746
- Which girl?
- Who's the girl?

810
01:18:29,854 --> 01:18:31,947
She's here to pay her bill.
But how did she get into my room?

811
01:18:32,056 --> 01:18:34,752
- How did she get there?
- Mannu, you know everything!

812
01:18:35,593 --> 01:18:37,959
- Do you know her?
- N... n. No! Yes, I do.

813
01:18:38,062 --> 01:18:40,895
- She owes us Rs. 5.75.
- Oh, so you've called her here?!

814
01:18:40,999 --> 01:18:42,967
Why should I?
She must have come on her own.

815
01:18:43,067 --> 01:18:45,763
How can such a big girl
come here uninvited?!

816
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:46,962
Exactly.

817
01:18:48,306 --> 01:18:50,774
All of you seem troubled
because I'm here.

818
01:18:50,875 --> 01:18:53,776
No. But you could have
paid the bill at the office.

819
01:18:53,878 --> 01:18:56,369
I was sleeping and you came
upstairs. It's a holiday today.

820
01:18:56,481 --> 01:18:58,278
Please listen to me.

821
01:18:58,816 --> 01:19:02,513
I had gone to your office. But
even there, a boy was dancing.

822
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:03,985
Even there?

823
01:19:04,088 --> 01:19:07,285
She went to pay her bill at
the office and Mojha was dancing!

824
01:19:07,825 --> 01:19:09,520
What audacity!
Bring my boxing gloves.

825
01:19:09,627 --> 01:19:10,787
Forget it.

826
01:19:10,895 --> 01:19:14,592
Excuse me. I have some work.
May I take Mannu along?

827
01:19:14,832 --> 01:19:19,201
I don't like my brothers
going out with girls...

828
01:19:19,304 --> 01:19:21,795
- Whose picture is this?
- I found it in his room.

829
01:19:21,906 --> 01:19:23,806
- A girl!
- A girl's picture!

830
01:19:23,908 --> 01:19:26,604
- Show me!
- Let me see!

831
01:19:26,844 --> 01:19:30,007
Give it here. It will tear.

832
01:19:30,248 --> 01:19:32,216
But how did a girl's picture
reach my room?

833
01:19:32,317 --> 01:19:35,013
- It was on your bed.
- Fine. But on my bed?!

834
01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:38,418
- It was under your pillow.
- I know. But how?!

835
01:19:38,856 --> 01:19:40,619
Shall I burn it with Mobil Oil?

836
01:19:40,858 --> 01:19:42,826
There's no need. I want to...

837
01:19:42,927 --> 01:19:47,330
Take him along. I'll find out how
a girl's bed reached my pillow!

838
01:19:47,432 --> 01:19:50,026
I mean, how a girl's picture was
found on my... l'll find out.

839
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:51,835
What's brother saying?!

840
01:19:56,874 --> 01:19:57,841
Okay.

841
01:19:59,877 --> 01:20:02,846
Hey! Everybody's gone?
I'll go to sleep!

842
01:20:16,094 --> 01:20:17,857
Come out.

843
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:24,993
Madam, where have you brought
me?

844
01:20:25,103 --> 01:20:26,661
Stop being so formal.

845
01:20:27,905 --> 01:20:29,668
Hold the basket.

846
01:20:30,908 --> 01:20:32,466
How is the place?

847
01:20:33,311 --> 01:20:34,869
It's beautiful!

848
01:20:44,922 --> 01:20:46,890
- Madam, you...
- You're being formal again.

849
01:20:46,991 --> 01:20:49,323
You mentioned that
you had some work?

850
01:20:49,427 --> 01:20:52,692
I don't spot any car here.
So what will I repair?

851
01:20:53,431 --> 01:20:56,889
Can't there be any work
other than repairing cars?

852
01:20:57,201 --> 01:21:00,102
- What else can there be?
- There can be many other jobs.

853
01:21:00,204 --> 01:21:01,899
- For instance?
- Will you be able to do it?

854
01:21:02,006 --> 01:21:03,701
I can do anything.

855
01:21:03,941 --> 01:21:05,909
- Think about it.
- I have.

856
01:21:06,010 --> 01:21:08,501
- Suppose you can't?
- I'll concede defeat then.

857
01:21:09,213 --> 01:21:11,909
Let's lay a bet.

858
01:21:12,016 --> 01:21:12,983
What?

859
01:21:13,951 --> 01:21:18,718
If you lose, you'll have to
carry the basket, the entire day.

860
01:21:18,956 --> 01:21:19,923
Basket?

861
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,926
- Do you accept?
- I do. Tell me the job.

862
01:21:23,027 --> 01:21:24,517
Let me think.

863
01:21:26,964 --> 01:21:29,432
You see that?

864
01:21:29,534 --> 01:21:30,728
Yes.

865
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:34,369
- What's it?
- A hen.

866
01:21:34,472 --> 01:21:35,939
- Go and catch it.
- The hen?

867
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:38,941
- Yes.
- That's no big deal!

868
01:21:39,043 --> 01:21:40,533
Hold this.

869
01:22:18,015 --> 01:22:20,779
"How's the gentleman feeling?"

870
01:22:21,018 --> 01:22:23,987
"How do you think I'm feeling?"

871
01:22:24,288 --> 01:22:27,780
"So zealous you appear"

872
01:22:28,025 --> 01:22:30,994
"I was swept off my feet
So I slipped"

873
01:23:07,064 --> 01:23:13,526
"Soft breeze begins to blow;
Your sari flutters to and fro"

874
01:23:14,071 --> 01:23:21,034
"Let go of it and watch
the white and dark clouds"

875
01:23:35,293 --> 01:23:40,560
"Your eyes convey messages
So conflicting"

876
01:24:11,128 --> 01:24:17,590
"Foolish girl, have you wondered
Why we ever met"

877
01:24:18,135 --> 01:24:24,597
"Foolish boy, why does every word
you say make my heart beat fast"

878
01:25:13,190 --> 01:25:19,959
"Should I spend every single day
with you this way?"

879
01:25:20,197 --> 01:25:26,966
"I fail to fathom a thing
So how do I tell you anything?"

880
01:26:39,276 --> 01:26:40,971
It was such a lovely day!

881
01:26:41,078 --> 01:26:43,046
Time just flew!

882
01:26:43,781 --> 01:26:46,249
I will always remember this day.

883
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:50,047
Let alone this day, I will
always remember this night too.

884
01:26:51,288 --> 01:26:52,255
Why?

885
01:26:52,356 --> 01:26:57,259
Only I know how much brother is
going to box me, once I get home.

886
01:26:57,361 --> 01:27:00,262
- Let's go. It's getting late.
- Are you so scared of them?

887
01:27:00,364 --> 01:27:02,332
No, I'm not!
But I have to be scared.

888
01:27:03,034 --> 01:27:07,664
Well, they love me very much,
and even I reciprocate that.

889
01:27:07,772 --> 01:27:12,471
So I'm afraid that I may
do something to upset them.

890
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:16,279
Wow! What cool breeze!

891
01:27:17,314 --> 01:27:19,282
Yes. What cool breeze!

892
01:27:21,318 --> 01:27:23,786
What a beautiful place!

893
01:27:23,921 --> 01:27:26,082
It's a lovely place!

894
01:27:26,323 --> 01:27:28,484
So let's sit here for a while.

895
01:27:28,826 --> 01:27:30,794
No! We'll get late!

896
01:27:30,895 --> 01:27:33,295
- No problem.
- You just don't understand.

897
01:27:35,132 --> 01:27:37,032
- It's 7 O'clock.
- Who cares!

898
01:27:37,134 --> 01:27:39,796
Elder brother will...
I'll be in deep trouble!

899
01:27:40,337 --> 01:27:43,306
Mannu, you haven't
understood a thing.

900
01:27:43,941 --> 01:27:46,705
- I understand everything!
- What do you understand?

901
01:27:46,811 --> 01:27:51,305
That girls nowadays are lazy.
Once they sit, they don't get up!

902
01:27:51,415 --> 01:27:54,111
Please hurry up.

903
01:28:06,363 --> 01:28:07,830
Nothing.

904
01:28:13,871 --> 01:28:16,339
- What are you thinking about?
- Nothing. But why?

905
01:28:18,642 --> 01:28:20,132
It's nothing.

906
01:28:20,878 --> 01:28:23,346
There's surely something.
Tell me.

907
01:28:24,381 --> 01:28:26,349
Hey, tell me.

908
01:28:31,655 --> 01:28:33,145
- Shall I?
- Yes.

909
01:28:42,967 --> 01:28:44,525
I'm getting married.

910
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:48,742
Married?

911
01:28:50,984 --> 01:28:52,451
Married?

912
01:28:55,488 --> 01:28:59,254
Oh? So you're getting married?
With which fool?

913
01:29:00,994 --> 01:29:04,452
Not with a fool
but with a prince.

914
01:29:04,764 --> 01:29:07,961
With a prince? That's obvious.

915
01:29:09,102 --> 01:29:13,061
I think... you are a bit jealous.

916
01:29:13,506 --> 01:29:16,475
Jealous? Why should I be jealous?

917
01:29:16,576 --> 01:29:22,481
Girls do get married. And then, I
am glad you're marrying a prince.

918
01:29:22,582 --> 01:29:25,483
The wedding will be held with
splendor. There will be feasts.

919
01:29:25,585 --> 01:29:27,485
And... and...

920
01:29:28,521 --> 01:29:30,284
And even I'll come.

921
01:29:31,524 --> 01:29:33,492
You're happy?

922
01:29:34,527 --> 01:29:36,495
I ought to be happy.

923
01:29:36,596 --> 01:29:40,794
Of course, we won't be
able to meet this way then.

924
01:29:41,034 --> 01:29:43,502
We won't have
the freedom to go out.

925
01:29:43,736 --> 01:29:46,500
Is that all?

926
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,701
What else can there be?

927
01:29:50,543 --> 01:29:54,502
I will get married and go away
to another man's house.

928
01:29:54,614 --> 01:29:57,310
Aren't you feeling bad at all?

929
01:29:57,750 --> 01:30:00,514
Yes... No.

930
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:03,020
- No?
- No.

931
01:30:05,058 --> 01:30:06,525
Not at all?

932
01:30:08,728 --> 01:30:10,320
Not at all.

933
01:30:34,087 --> 01:30:38,547
Mr. Kishanchand, if you give
your consent, I'll be at peace.

934
01:30:38,658 --> 01:30:43,561
You have approached us with the
proposal. So how can I refuse?

935
01:30:43,663 --> 01:30:47,360
But I must ask Renu once.

936
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:51,559
Sure. But I've already approved
of Renu for my younger brother.

937
01:30:51,671 --> 01:30:54,231
Thank you. I consider
myself fortunate.

938
01:30:54,407 --> 01:30:55,965
Exactly what I wanted to say.

939
01:30:56,075 --> 01:30:58,703
We received many proposals
from royal families.

940
01:30:58,811 --> 01:31:02,770
But all the other girls
paled in comparison with Renu.

941
01:31:03,616 --> 01:31:05,982
By the way, when will Prakash
be returning from abroad?

942
01:31:06,085 --> 01:31:09,020
Very soon. God willing, even you
will be as happy to see him...

943
01:31:09,122 --> 01:31:11,113
...as I was, on seeing Renu.

944
01:31:11,224 --> 01:31:13,590
Why not? After all, he is
your younger brother.

945
01:31:13,693 --> 01:31:17,595
I'm not praising him
because he is my younger brother.

946
01:31:17,697 --> 01:31:19,790
But because
he is a brilliant boy.

947
01:31:20,633 --> 01:31:23,397
Renu, come here.

948
01:31:24,637 --> 01:31:27,265
Meet King Hardayal Singh.

949
01:31:35,648 --> 01:31:37,115
Do you like the design?

950
01:31:37,216 --> 01:31:39,616
Why did you bother?

951
01:31:39,719 --> 01:31:43,018
Does one go empty-handed to fix a
marriage? Lt's only a small token.

952
01:31:44,157 --> 01:31:46,125
Take it, my child... You tell her.

953
01:31:46,225 --> 01:31:50,924
Take it, my dear. If that's what
he wants, how can we refuse him?

954
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:52,829
Thank you.

955
01:31:57,070 --> 01:32:00,437
- Father, may I...
- Yes, you may go now.

956
01:32:04,877 --> 01:32:07,778
In spite of being the daughter
of such a wealthy father...

957
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:11,441
...she is so gentle and coy.
They will make a good pair.

958
01:32:34,774 --> 01:32:37,242
Can't you make out how changed
Mannu is from how he was at dawn?

959
01:32:37,343 --> 01:32:38,742
- No.
- Take this.

960
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:40,244
He's become a bit fat.

961
01:32:40,346 --> 01:32:43,679
- Rubbish! What are you thinking?
- Nothing.

962
01:32:43,783 --> 01:32:47,241
- You'd laugh over dinner daily...
- You'd create a din.

963
01:32:47,353 --> 01:32:49,253
What's wrong?

964
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:51,755
- I told you, it's nothing.
- Tell us what happened!

965
01:32:51,858 --> 01:32:53,985
- I told you, it's nothing!
- He says, it's nothing.

966
01:32:54,093 --> 01:32:55,754
He's playing with fire!

967
01:32:55,862 --> 01:32:58,763
- Exactly! With fire?
- Yes!

968
01:33:00,299 --> 01:33:02,699
I'd warned you not to
get involved with rich girls.

969
01:33:02,802 --> 01:33:04,269
- Exactly.
- You shut up!

970
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:08,466
They never stand by you. Continue
this way and you'll sulk forever!

971
01:33:08,574 --> 01:33:10,269
- And not eat.
- You eat your food!

972
01:33:10,376 --> 01:33:12,674
- But I disagree.
- About what?

973
01:33:12,812 --> 01:33:14,780
That every rich girl is...

974
01:33:18,818 --> 01:33:21,013
Mannu, you still
haven't seen the world.

975
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:23,281
Mannu, you still
haven't seen the world.

976
01:33:23,389 --> 01:33:25,084
- Have you?
- No.

977
01:33:26,325 --> 01:33:28,555
It's for your good. Women are
the root cause of all troubles.

978
01:33:28,895 --> 01:33:30,863
Stay away
from even their shadows!

979
01:33:30,997 --> 01:33:33,488
Then why do you keep a
woman's picture with you?

980
01:33:43,342 --> 01:33:45,640
I wasn't going to hide about it
from both of you.

981
01:33:46,345 --> 01:33:48,813
I thought I'd tell you
at an opportune time.

982
01:33:49,348 --> 01:33:51,748
You asked
why I keep that picture.

983
01:33:51,851 --> 01:33:54,046
It's because I loved that girl.

984
01:33:54,153 --> 01:33:57,520
She was also
a beautiful and rich girl.

985
01:33:58,357 --> 01:34:01,326
But I was an ordinary man then.

986
01:34:01,861 --> 01:34:05,319
Therefore, she jilted me
for a man as rich as her.

987
01:34:06,966 --> 01:34:09,332
The trauma of it still hurts.

988
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:12,768
If not for both of you,
I may have taken a drastic step.

989
01:34:12,872 --> 01:34:15,340
Perhaps even killed myself.

990
01:34:16,943 --> 01:34:21,346
I only want to say that I don't
want you to get hurt like me.

991
01:34:21,447 --> 01:34:23,347
You will not be able to bear it.

992
01:34:26,385 --> 01:34:28,148
Eat your dinner.

993
01:34:56,415 --> 01:35:01,375
"I'm yours"

994
01:35:01,487 --> 01:35:06,186
"Come and see for yourself"

995
01:35:12,932 --> 01:35:18,893
"If convinced you're not
Then ask my heart"

996
01:35:45,665 --> 01:35:48,429
"When two hearts meet"

997
01:35:48,534 --> 01:35:51,560
"What can the world do, my love?"

998
01:35:51,971 --> 01:35:55,429
"When two hearts meet"

999
01:35:55,541 --> 01:35:58,510
"The world will
Burn with envy, my love"

1000
01:36:12,291 --> 01:36:18,252
"If you wish,
Walk a few steps with me and see"

1001
01:36:51,530 --> 01:36:54,499
"The unbridled joys
That love can bring"

1002
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:57,933
"Hearing about it
Will make you so oblivious"

1003
01:36:58,037 --> 01:37:01,234
"The unbridled joys
That love can bring"

1004
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:04,104
"You will begin to fathom"

1005
01:37:18,057 --> 01:37:24,326
"Let your heart be on fire
Just the way mine is, all night"

1006
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:03,828
"The one who truly loves you"

1007
01:38:03,936 --> 01:38:07,372
"Sorrows she'll fear none"

1008
01:38:07,606 --> 01:38:10,575
"The one who truly loves you"

1009
01:38:10,676 --> 01:38:13,577
"Will never whimper a protest"

1010
01:38:27,126 --> 01:38:33,087
"If you wish
Tear apart my heart and see"

1011
01:39:02,661 --> 01:39:04,424
Fantastic!

1012
01:39:14,874 --> 01:39:17,638
Shut the door,
and don't let anybody inside.

1013
01:39:17,743 --> 01:39:18,767
Very well.

1014
01:39:18,878 --> 01:39:20,641
How come you've returned so soon?

1015
01:39:23,682 --> 01:39:27,448
Rajasaheb, Ramlal has been
arrested... with the diamonds!

1016
01:39:27,686 --> 01:39:29,847
There's no need to worry.
Sit down.

1017
01:39:31,690 --> 01:39:34,158
- The diamonds were fake.
- What!

1018
01:39:34,693 --> 01:39:37,321
I didn't know. I was scared...

1019
01:39:37,496 --> 01:39:41,159
Prakash! You still don't know me.
I think of the future.

1020
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:44,260
So, did you suspect that
Ramlal would get caught?

1021
01:39:44,703 --> 01:39:48,867
I didn't suspect, I was sure. I
wanted to see how shrewd he is.

1022
01:39:50,209 --> 01:39:54,669
Now that he's in jail, we know
that he is of no use to us.

1023
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:57,681
Suppose he reveals about us
to the police, then?

1024
01:39:58,918 --> 01:40:02,012
No. He wouldn't dare.

1025
01:40:02,221 --> 01:40:03,688
Why?

1026
01:40:03,789 --> 01:40:09,694
Because I have promised
to look after his children.

1027
01:40:09,795 --> 01:40:13,891
Whether he gets
imprisoned or divulges.

1028
01:40:14,934 --> 01:40:18,700
Rajasaheb! You do
think of the future!

1029
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:20,203
Anyway...

1030
01:40:22,741 --> 01:40:24,299
Look at this picture.

1031
01:40:29,748 --> 01:40:31,511
How is she?

1032
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:33,513
Extremely beautiful.

1033
01:40:36,755 --> 01:40:41,215
She's a golden goose. She's the
only daughter of a rich father.

1034
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:44,228
Have you heard of Mr. Kishanchand?

1035
01:40:44,763 --> 01:40:47,732
He can buy
many rich men like you!

1036
01:40:47,833 --> 01:40:51,530
Yes, but he suffers from
blood pressure problems.

1037
01:40:54,773 --> 01:40:57,742
You seem to
be plotting a new scheme?

1038
01:40:58,277 --> 01:41:00,745
I've already plotted.

1039
01:41:00,846 --> 01:41:03,542
From now on, you are my younger
brother - Prince Prakashchand.

1040
01:41:03,782 --> 01:41:05,249
Really?

1041
01:41:05,784 --> 01:41:07,752
Only for this job.

1042
01:41:09,788 --> 01:41:12,154
No problem.
What do I have to do?

1043
01:41:12,291 --> 01:41:13,758
Get married.

1044
01:41:14,793 --> 01:41:16,954
- To her?
- Yes.

1045
01:41:17,062 --> 01:41:21,556
You are abroad now, and will
return after a couple of days.

1046
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:24,769
You will then
be introduced to Renu.

1047
01:41:24,870 --> 01:41:29,773
Within a month, you'll have to
impress Renu and her father...

1048
01:41:29,875 --> 01:41:32,776
...so much that they will
not consider anyone else...

1049
01:41:32,878 --> 01:41:36,974
...but you as being worthy
of her husband.

1050
01:41:38,317 --> 01:41:40,581
- Then?
- You'll get married!

1051
01:41:41,820 --> 01:41:44,789
I understand! Then, Renu's
father will suddenly die...

1052
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:47,120
...and all his wealth
will be mine.

1053
01:41:47,826 --> 01:41:49,589
Not all, only half of it.

1054
01:41:49,828 --> 01:41:51,796
So be it.

1055
01:41:51,897 --> 01:41:57,597
As far as I know, you have
tried such a scheme earlier too.

1056
01:41:57,836 --> 01:42:02,205
Indeed. I did get 700-800
thousand from Kamini's father.

1057
01:42:02,341 --> 01:42:04,809
Did your father-in-law also
have a blood pressure problem?

1058
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:07,606
No. He was a heart patient.

1059
01:42:11,050 --> 01:42:12,813
A penny for your thoughts!

1060
01:42:12,918 --> 01:42:14,818
It's nothing. I was wondering...

1061
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:20,017
...why you make such schemes when
you have wealth in abundance?

1062
01:42:20,859 --> 01:42:25,819
Prakash, once you acquire wealth,
you will understand.

1063
01:42:25,931 --> 01:42:28,229
It's the wealthy
who lust for more wealth.

1064
01:42:28,334 --> 01:42:30,325
The hungry need only food.

1065
01:42:30,436 --> 01:42:33,837
And if we don't usurp their
wealth, someone else will.

1066
01:42:33,939 --> 01:42:36,840
After all, we aren't the
only intelligent men around.

1067
01:42:36,942 --> 01:42:39,843
Rajasaheb! Madam has
escaped from her room!

1068
01:42:39,945 --> 01:42:41,276
How?!

1069
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:43,848
She attacked the woman who
went to her room with the food.

1070
01:42:44,883 --> 01:42:46,646
Let me go!

1071
01:42:48,487 --> 01:42:49,852
Leave me!

1072
01:42:51,890 --> 01:42:53,653
How did she come downstairs?!

1073
01:42:53,892 --> 01:42:55,450
All of you leave!

1074
01:42:55,894 --> 01:42:57,657
Let me go!

1075
01:42:57,896 --> 01:43:00,865
Kamini! You're getting more and
more insane by the day! Come on!

1076
01:43:00,966 --> 01:43:02,866
I am not insane! Let me go!

1077
01:43:02,968 --> 01:43:04,868
All crazy people say that!

1078
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:06,597
No, I am not crazy!

1079
01:43:07,172 --> 01:43:09,367
- I won't go there! I'm scared!
- Come upstairs!

1080
01:43:09,908 --> 01:43:11,671
- I hate you! Leave me!
- Come upstairs!

1081
01:43:12,244 --> 01:43:13,871
- Come upstairs!
- No!

1082
01:43:13,979 --> 01:43:15,879
No!!

1083
01:43:16,415 --> 01:43:17,882
- Get up!
- Let me go!

1084
01:43:17,983 --> 01:43:19,883
- Get up, Kamini!
- No!

1085
01:43:21,420 --> 01:43:24,389
- No!
- Come on!

1086
01:43:27,192 --> 01:43:30,889
Leave me! I am not crazy!

1087
01:43:31,430 --> 01:43:36,390
Leave me! I am not crazy!

1088
01:43:36,669 --> 01:43:37,693
Leave me!

1089
01:43:41,940 --> 01:43:43,407
Sit down quietly!

1090
01:43:43,542 --> 01:43:46,909
Why should I?!
I am not afraid of you!

1091
01:43:47,446 --> 01:43:49,914
I don't fear
your threats anymore!

1092
01:43:50,015 --> 01:43:51,983
You can't silence me anymore!

1093
01:43:52,084 --> 01:43:54,917
I will tell the world
that you are a murderer!

1094
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:56,647
You poisoned father to death!

1095
01:43:56,755 --> 01:43:59,315
Kamini! Do not forget who I am!

1096
01:43:59,425 --> 01:44:01,916
I can never forget that!

1097
01:44:02,027 --> 01:44:04,928
I can never forget the
manager who betrayed us!

1098
01:44:05,230 --> 01:44:10,133
Wretch! My father was ready
to get me married to Brijmohan.

1099
01:44:10,235 --> 01:44:14,934
But you held me captive that
very day and poisoned my father!

1100
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:19,943
And when I refused to marry you,
you claimed that I was crazy!

1101
01:44:20,245 --> 01:44:24,944
I can never forget the atrocities
inflicted on me since 10 years!

1102
01:44:25,050 --> 01:44:26,950
I will surely seek vengeance!

1103
01:44:27,252 --> 01:44:30,449
Leave me! Let go of me!

1104
01:44:34,593 --> 01:44:37,960
She's getting madder by the day!
It isn't safe to keep her here.

1105
01:44:38,063 --> 01:44:40,964
Take her and lock her in
her father's empty house.

1106
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:44,761
She can scream as much
as she wants to, there!

1107
01:44:50,175 --> 01:44:51,972
Well, you've been
introduced to each other now.

1108
01:44:52,077 --> 01:44:55,979
Sit and talk. I'll go
and meet my solicitor.

1109
01:45:29,047 --> 01:45:30,810
Your house is extremely splendid!

1110
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:33,816
- Pardon?
- Thank you.

1111
01:45:38,323 --> 01:45:40,518
You have become silent again.

1112
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:43,027
What do I talk about?

1113
01:45:43,128 --> 01:45:46,029
Well... about anything.

1114
01:45:47,065 --> 01:45:48,532
All right.

1115
01:45:50,068 --> 01:45:52,229
- Your coat material is good.
- I beg your pardon?

1116
01:45:55,073 --> 01:45:58,042
Did you like it?
I bought it abroad.

1117
01:45:59,077 --> 01:46:01,545
- I can see that.
- What?

1118
01:46:07,085 --> 01:46:09,053
You aren't mocking me, are you?

1119
01:46:09,154 --> 01:46:12,180
What! Do you think
I'm so impertinent?!

1120
01:46:12,291 --> 01:46:15,488
No! You appear quite interesting.

1121
01:46:17,095 --> 01:46:20,064
There's much more to you
than what Rajasaheb told me.

1122
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:27,261
Ms. Renu, what are your hobbies?

1123
01:46:33,111 --> 01:46:35,079
Especially, motor driving.

1124
01:46:37,115 --> 01:46:40,573
Even my hobbies are the same!
I've brought my new car.

1125
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:42,587
What do you mean?

1126
01:46:45,123 --> 01:46:47,091
My friend will be here at 8:30.

1127
01:46:47,192 --> 01:46:50,093
But it's only 8 O'clock now. We
will be back in half an hour.

1128
01:46:50,195 --> 01:46:51,890
Come on.

1129
01:47:07,145 --> 01:47:11,912
Hey, you look so uncomfortable.
Relax. Feel at home.

1130
01:47:14,152 --> 01:47:16,120
We should get to
know each other, right?

1131
01:47:17,155 --> 01:47:19,316
You are absolutely right.

1132
01:47:19,658 --> 01:47:21,319
You're very sensible.

1133
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:23,127
You're no less.

1134
01:47:24,363 --> 01:47:27,628
One won't find a sensible girl
like you in the whole continent!

1135
01:47:28,033 --> 01:47:29,125
You searched?

1136
01:47:29,234 --> 01:47:31,327
Even if I tried,
I wouldn't find one!

1137
01:47:31,970 --> 01:47:34,131
I hope you don't mind the speed?

1138
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:36,537
How fast can you drive?

1139
01:47:36,642 --> 01:47:38,872
I'm driving at 60 kms/hour.
I can take it up to 80.

1140
01:47:38,977 --> 01:47:40,945
I can drive faster.

1141
01:47:41,179 --> 01:47:42,646
You're very smart.

1142
01:47:42,748 --> 01:47:44,716
But if you want to see how fast
I drive, come tomorrow.

1143
01:47:44,816 --> 01:47:47,148
- Tomorrow?
- Yes. At Juhu Airdrome.

1144
01:47:47,252 --> 01:47:50,153
Even I have enlisted my name
for motor racing.

1145
01:47:50,255 --> 01:47:54,157
If you come, I'll surely win.
...You will come, won't you?

1146
01:47:54,259 --> 01:47:58,161
Yes, I will have to come now.
Or you will not win!

1147
01:48:07,205 --> 01:48:11,608
Mannu, your work is over.
Then why are you waiting here?

1148
01:48:11,710 --> 01:48:13,678
- For no reason.
- Really?

1149
01:48:14,212 --> 01:48:16,180
- I know why!
- Why?

1150
01:48:16,281 --> 01:48:20,183
What's the use of sulking?
Go and meet her.

1151
01:48:20,285 --> 01:48:21,980
I won't!

1152
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:26,680
You are hopeless! Come back in
a jiffy. Brother will never know.

1153
01:48:26,792 --> 01:48:29,625
- You will tell him everything!
- That's the problem, Mannu.

1154
01:48:29,728 --> 01:48:34,188
I can't keep things to myself.
I try to please brother and you.

1155
01:48:34,299 --> 01:48:38,201
You are the youngest. I love
you so much. It's such a problem!

1156
01:48:38,303 --> 01:48:39,998
There's brother.

1157
01:48:40,739 --> 01:48:42,400
- It's such a problem!
- What's the problem?

1158
01:48:42,507 --> 01:48:44,634
Nothing as such... Renu's phone...

1159
01:48:45,243 --> 01:48:47,404
- Hadn't I warned you?
- Brother!

1160
01:48:47,746 --> 01:48:49,213
Did I say a thing?!

1161
01:48:51,249 --> 01:48:53,012
It must be Renu.

1162
01:48:54,753 --> 01:48:57,950
Renu? Wait.

1163
01:48:58,056 --> 01:48:59,717
It's some other girl.

1164
01:49:00,258 --> 01:49:03,227
Pardon? Whom do you
want to speak to?

1165
01:49:04,262 --> 01:49:06,822
Jagmohan? Lt's your call.

1166
01:49:06,932 --> 01:49:10,026
Jagmohan? How can that be?
Which girl would phone me?

1167
01:49:10,769 --> 01:49:12,236
This is Sheela here.

1168
01:49:12,471 --> 01:49:14,234
Sheela!

1169
01:49:17,275 --> 01:49:18,674
What are you saying?!

1170
01:49:18,777 --> 01:49:20,244
An emergency case of a Chevrolet!

1171
01:49:23,281 --> 01:49:27,047
Hello! Lt's an emergency
case of a Chevrolet car!

1172
01:49:28,487 --> 01:49:31,047
Which Chevrolet car, and whose?!

1173
01:49:31,289 --> 01:49:34,781
Emergency? What are you talking
about? What's wrong with you?

1174
01:49:35,293 --> 01:49:38,262
Nothing... What's wrong
with your car?

1175
01:49:38,497 --> 01:49:41,261
My car?
My car is fine, gentleman.

1176
01:49:41,366 --> 01:49:44,267
But are you feeling fine?

1177
01:49:44,503 --> 01:49:45,470
Pardon?

1178
01:49:45,637 --> 01:49:48,071
You had said that you would
take me out in the car?

1179
01:49:48,306 --> 01:49:50,672
Yes, I did... Move aside!

1180
01:49:50,809 --> 01:49:52,276
What are you doing today?

1181
01:49:52,477 --> 01:49:56,277
We are very busy today,
so I will not be able to come.

1182
01:49:56,381 --> 01:49:59,782
Why don't you come to the car
race tomorrow at the airdrome?

1183
01:49:59,885 --> 01:50:05,084
Meet me there. I'll repair
your car... your Chevrolet there.

1184
01:50:05,524 --> 01:50:08,084
You will meet me, won't you?

1185
01:50:09,728 --> 01:50:10,558
Please do come.

1186
01:50:11,329 --> 01:50:15,288
Brother Jaggu, what kind of
an emergency case is this?

1187
01:50:36,354 --> 01:50:39,323
- Hey!
- You!

1188
01:50:40,158 --> 01:50:41,819
We could have come together.

1189
01:50:41,927 --> 01:50:43,326
How was I to know you'd be here?

1190
01:50:43,428 --> 01:50:46,829
I had to come for Mr. Prakash.
But what are you doing here?

1191
01:50:46,965 --> 01:50:49,331
- My round, chubby man is here.
- Where is he?!

1192
01:50:49,434 --> 01:50:53,131
Do you see that old car?
That's him near it.

1193
01:50:53,638 --> 01:50:57,540
Hey! So, even they are here?
...That's fantastic!

1194
01:51:02,647 --> 01:51:05,548
Hail Lord Hanuman!

1195
01:51:09,588 --> 01:51:11,146
Pay your respects.

1196
01:51:34,679 --> 01:51:36,169
Brother Jaggu!

1197
01:51:40,418 --> 01:51:43,387
- Look, what's happened!
- What's wrong?

1198
01:52:25,964 --> 01:52:28,228
Hey, move back!

1199
01:52:33,471 --> 01:52:36,440
Hey, my cap! Give my cap.

1200
01:52:36,541 --> 01:52:38,634
Here, take your cap.

1201
01:54:31,589 --> 01:54:34,558
The first prize this year
goes to Manmohan Sharma.

1202
01:54:57,615 --> 01:54:59,378
- How are you, Renu?
- So you did recognise me?

1203
01:54:59,617 --> 01:55:01,585
- How could I not?
- I thought you'd forgotten me.

1204
01:55:01,686 --> 01:55:03,153
How can I?

1205
01:55:03,254 --> 01:55:06,587
I thought you were angry and
would call, once you calmed down.

1206
01:55:06,691 --> 01:55:08,659
- Even you could have phoned!
- I could.

1207
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:11,593
But then I feared that
you would get more furious.

1208
01:55:11,696 --> 01:55:14,790
- I am crazy, am I not?
- Y... y... yes... N... n... no!

1209
01:55:15,033 --> 01:55:17,092
Renu, well actually...

1210
01:55:17,202 --> 01:55:20,603
I've not been able to understand
you and your moods.

1211
01:55:20,705 --> 01:55:23,105
- Well, you talk that way!
- I promise it won't happen again.

1212
01:55:23,208 --> 01:55:24,937
But please don't get angry.

1213
01:55:25,143 --> 01:55:27,611
- Hold your ears once again.
- Here!

1214
01:55:28,646 --> 01:55:31,615
Mr. Prakash, I suppose
I wasn't lucky for you.

1215
01:55:31,716 --> 01:55:33,809
Mannu won the prize instead.

1216
01:55:34,652 --> 01:55:37,621
I forgot the introductions.
Manmohan... He's Prince...

1217
01:55:38,656 --> 01:55:41,124
He is the prince
about whom I'd mentioned.

1218
01:55:41,226 --> 01:55:42,420
Prince?

1219
01:55:45,864 --> 01:55:47,422
Let's go. We're getting late.

1220
01:55:57,675 --> 01:55:59,370
I was looking for you,
and you were here!

1221
01:55:59,677 --> 01:56:02,237
- Renu, this is important!
- What is it?

1222
01:56:02,347 --> 01:56:04,076
Let's go somewhere else.

1223
01:56:04,182 --> 01:56:06,446
- Excuse me. I'll be back soon.
- Let's go.

1224
01:56:11,189 --> 01:56:14,647
Renu, has your marriage
been fixed with this prince?

1225
01:56:15,693 --> 01:56:18,093
Yes. Don't you like him?

1226
01:56:18,196 --> 01:56:23,065
I may be mistaken, but he's
the prince of which realm?

1227
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:24,658
How would I know!

1228
01:56:24,769 --> 01:56:27,465
- Are you blindly marrying him?
- Yes. Why?

1229
01:56:27,705 --> 01:56:29,673
No! Please don't marry him.

1230
01:56:32,343 --> 01:56:35,107
I had told you the other day
itself that you're a bit jealous.

1231
01:56:35,213 --> 01:56:37,681
However, you had disagreed.
But it's turned out to be true.

1232
01:56:37,782 --> 01:56:39,477
Yes... No, you don't understand.

1233
01:56:39,717 --> 01:56:40,684
I do.

1234
01:56:40,785 --> 01:56:45,279
I think I had seen him dumping
Lalchand's body the other day.

1235
01:56:45,723 --> 01:56:46,690
Yes.

1236
01:56:46,791 --> 01:56:49,692
- What are you saying, Mannu!
- The truth, Renu.

1237
01:56:49,928 --> 01:56:53,694
The same looks, the same style.

1238
01:56:53,798 --> 01:56:55,493
And the same hairstyle.

1239
01:56:55,733 --> 01:56:57,997
Enough, Mannu! Water!

1240
01:56:58,736 --> 01:57:01,204
Water, please!

1241
01:57:10,048 --> 01:57:11,515
Are you all right?

1242
01:57:11,749 --> 01:57:13,216
Are you sure?

1243
01:57:13,318 --> 01:57:16,981
Absolutely, Renu. I never
forget faces all my life!

1244
01:57:18,756 --> 01:57:20,724
- Let's inform the police.
- Okay.

1245
01:57:20,825 --> 01:57:23,726
No, wait. If you're wrong,
we'll get into trouble.

1246
01:57:24,762 --> 01:57:27,230
- So what do we do?
- What do we do?

1247
01:57:27,432 --> 01:57:30,526
I know! We should become spies.

1248
01:57:30,768 --> 01:57:32,235
- Yes!
- Good idea?

1249
01:57:32,337 --> 01:57:34,237
He's looking our way.

1250
01:57:37,775 --> 01:57:39,743
We must follow him on the sly.

1251
01:57:39,978 --> 01:57:41,741
Don't move your hand so much.

1252
01:57:41,846 --> 01:57:45,543
And we must find out
what exactly he does.

1253
01:57:45,783 --> 01:57:47,751
- You'll be with me, won't you?
- Of course.

1254
01:57:47,852 --> 01:57:50,252
All right, as soon as I
get a chance, I'll phone you.

1255
01:57:53,291 --> 01:57:56,158
- Won't your brothers object?
- In this matter, I don't care!

1256
01:58:10,408 --> 01:58:11,568
Spies!

1257
01:58:28,826 --> 01:58:31,294
What's happening?

1258
01:58:32,830 --> 01:58:34,593
Brother Jaggu, in love?

1259
01:58:35,633 --> 01:58:37,794
Well, won't you
introduce me to her?

1260
01:58:38,036 --> 01:58:40,596
What are you doing here?
Let's go home!

1261
01:58:40,838 --> 01:58:42,305
Your friend?

1262
01:58:43,408 --> 01:58:45,808
You befriend
an ordinary mechanic?!

1263
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:47,935
What's wrong with that?

1264
01:58:48,046 --> 01:58:50,310
But I certainly
do not approve of it!

1265
01:58:51,849 --> 01:58:53,817
- However, I like it.
- But I don't approve of...

1266
01:58:53,918 --> 01:58:56,819
...you joking around with
an ordinary mechanic in public!

1267
01:58:56,921 --> 01:58:59,822
I didn't know
you were so petty-minded!

1268
01:58:59,924 --> 01:59:02,017
And I didn't know
you were so shameless!

1269
01:59:03,061 --> 01:59:04,824
Who are you to say such things?!

1270
01:59:04,929 --> 01:59:06,328
Your future husband!

1271
01:59:06,431 --> 01:59:09,423
Future husband! But you aren't!
And you never will be!

1272
01:59:13,871 --> 01:59:15,839
Why were you introduced to Renu?

1273
01:59:16,074 --> 01:59:18,235
- Well...
- For business.

1274
01:59:18,343 --> 01:59:20,641
And not to fall in love with her.

1275
01:59:20,878 --> 01:59:24,837
You can get plenty of girls
but not a rich girl like Renu.

1276
01:59:25,183 --> 01:59:29,847
If you do want to fall in love,
then it will be done my way.

1277
01:59:30,888 --> 01:59:33,652
You will get Renu,
and I will get the wealth.

1278
01:59:35,893 --> 01:59:40,660
Well, Mr. Kumar,
learn from my experiences.

1279
01:59:46,904 --> 01:59:52,069
Wow! It's beautiful!
But, son, such expensive gifts...

1280
01:59:52,477 --> 01:59:56,675
It's not my fault. Rajasaheb has
personally chosen it and sent it.

1281
01:59:57,915 --> 02:00:01,874
This is not fair.
I'll speak to him about it.

1282
02:00:01,986 --> 02:00:05,319
It's a gift, so it
can't even be returned.

1283
02:00:05,423 --> 02:00:07,687
My dear, please accept them.

1284
02:00:08,926 --> 02:00:11,690
- Sir, the car is ready.
- Please keep these upstairs.

1285
02:00:12,930 --> 02:00:16,889
Renu, sit with him. I have
some important work to attend to.

1286
02:00:29,947 --> 02:00:31,915
- Please sit.
- After you, please.

1287
02:00:34,452 --> 02:00:37,717
I think you're angry with me?

1288
02:00:37,955 --> 02:00:40,924
No, I am not. Why?

1289
02:00:41,025 --> 02:00:46,725
I apologise for whatever
I said after the car race.

1290
02:00:46,964 --> 02:00:48,932
I came here
to say that I'm sorry.

1291
02:00:49,233 --> 02:00:54,136
Sorry?! I didn't
take it to heart at all.

1292
02:00:54,472 --> 02:00:58,431
Really? And I was worried sick,
wondering what you'd be thinking.

1293
02:01:01,179 --> 02:01:03,739
Permit me to leave now.

1294
02:01:03,981 --> 02:01:06,541
Are you leaving already?

1295
02:01:06,984 --> 02:01:09,953
Yes, I have some important work.

1296
02:01:11,989 --> 02:01:13,456
Please sit for a while.

1297
02:01:13,558 --> 02:01:15,685
I surely would.
But somebody is waiting for me.

1298
02:01:15,793 --> 02:01:17,954
Won't you stay
even at my request?

1299
02:01:18,062 --> 02:01:19,962
- Let me go today.
- Fine.

1300
02:01:20,064 --> 02:01:22,157
Then I'll assume that you're
the one who's angry with me.

1301
02:01:22,266 --> 02:01:24,962
How can I be angry with you?

1302
02:01:25,069 --> 02:01:28,163
Then sit down... Just a minute.

1303
02:01:49,427 --> 02:01:52,658
It's a girl? I'll be dead!
Sir... there's a girl on the line.

1304
02:01:52,830 --> 02:01:53,797
A girl?

1305
02:01:56,033 --> 02:01:57,796
- Renu?
- He's here.

1306
02:01:58,035 --> 02:02:00,731
- He's there?
- And he wants to leave right now.

1307
02:02:01,038 --> 02:02:04,735
Don't. Keep him engrossed.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.

1308
02:02:05,042 --> 02:02:07,010
- Come soon.
- I'll be there in a jiffy.

1309
02:02:07,111 --> 02:02:08,578
How will I know?

1310
02:02:09,547 --> 02:02:16,316
I'll park my car a little away
from your house and honk twice.

1311
02:02:17,121 --> 02:02:18,213
All right.

1312
02:02:19,490 --> 02:02:21,822
I'm sorry, but I'm getting late.

1313
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:26,519
"Hey you!
Please wait awhile"

1314
02:02:27,064 --> 02:02:29,032
"What's the hurry?"

1315
02:02:29,267 --> 02:02:32,828
"Thorns of separation
Will prick me all the while"

1316
02:02:57,094 --> 02:03:01,053
"Twilight descends
And you get set to go, beloved"

1317
02:03:01,299 --> 02:03:05,861
"For my sake
Walk not away from me"

1318
02:03:15,112 --> 02:03:19,572
"My love, don't be so unjust"

1319
02:03:20,117 --> 02:03:23,746
"For I'm a girl so delicate"

1320
02:03:46,644 --> 02:03:49,112
"Many a thing I want to tell you"

1321
02:03:49,213 --> 02:03:52,114
"So let me say it all"

1322
02:03:52,216 --> 02:03:54,776
"Many a thing
This heart full of love holds"

1323
02:03:54,886 --> 02:03:56,911
"So let me say it all"

1324
02:04:06,163 --> 02:04:10,327
"Wait awhile, my love
Let me come to my senses"

1325
02:04:10,668 --> 02:04:14,126
"Since the time you've come,
A little lost I've been"

1326
02:04:38,195 --> 02:04:42,154
"Just think, my dear
Of what I receive for loving you"

1327
02:04:42,700 --> 02:04:46,966
"Just think, my love
A thousand deaths I die"

1328
02:04:56,213 --> 02:05:00,673
"Wait awhile
Don't break my heart"

1329
02:05:01,218 --> 02:05:04,984
"But a man who spurns love
Will never give this a thought"

1330
02:05:25,242 --> 02:05:26,800
You're interesting!

1331
02:05:36,754 --> 02:05:41,020
I'm sure you'll give me a place
I deserve in your heart.

1332
02:05:44,261 --> 02:05:46,024
- You're getting late.
- No, I'm not.

1333
02:05:46,263 --> 02:05:50,029
Even if all of the beautiful
girls in the world beckon me...

1334
02:05:50,267 --> 02:05:52,895
...I wouldn't be
willing to leave you now.

1335
02:05:53,471 --> 02:05:54,438
No?

1336
02:05:57,274 --> 02:06:00,243
But you'd said that you
have some important work.

1337
02:06:00,344 --> 02:06:03,313
Yes, I did have work but
that work can be done tomorrow.

1338
02:06:03,781 --> 02:06:08,047
No. I don't want your work
to suffer because of me.

1339
02:06:08,552 --> 02:06:12,511
Your work is important. Don't
bother about me, I'll wait.

1340
02:06:14,291 --> 02:06:18,057
- You are asking me to leave?
- Yes... N... n... no!

1341
02:06:18,295 --> 02:06:21,696
I mean, I hope there are
opportunities like this again!

1342
02:06:21,799 --> 02:06:23,767
And that I get
a chance to stop you again!

1343
02:06:30,307 --> 02:06:34,073
You are so nice!
I just don't feel like going.

1344
02:06:34,311 --> 02:06:36,074
Even I don't want you to go.

1345
02:06:48,325 --> 02:06:49,792
- Renu.
- Yes?

1346
02:06:49,927 --> 02:06:51,485
- Renu.
- Yes?

1347
02:06:51,829 --> 02:06:53,888
Stop saying my name
and say something!

1348
02:06:54,031 --> 02:06:56,090
Do you think he suspects
that we're following him?

1349
02:06:56,333 --> 02:06:58,893
Suspects? How's that possible?

1350
02:06:59,003 --> 02:07:01,801
- Look! He's driving slowly now.
- You too slow down.

1351
02:07:02,339 --> 02:07:06,298
We must keep a safe distance.
If he turns, he'll recognise us.

1352
02:07:06,410 --> 02:07:08,310
- You shouldn't have come with me.
- Why?

1353
02:07:08,412 --> 02:07:11,313
- He can recognise you from afar.
- But how can he, in this car?!

1354
02:07:11,415 --> 02:07:14,316
You're beautiful and it is
hard to hide a beautiful face.

1355
02:07:14,418 --> 02:07:17,319
That's enough.
He can recognize you too.

1356
02:07:17,521 --> 02:07:20,319
- How?
- He's seen you at the car race.

1357
02:07:20,424 --> 02:07:21,755
Oh yes!

1358
02:07:21,859 --> 02:07:25,317
What are you doing? There will be
an accident. Please don't honk.

1359
02:07:25,429 --> 02:07:27,124
What to do? He'll recognise me!

1360
02:07:27,364 --> 02:07:29,628
You make me also nervous!

1361
02:07:39,376 --> 02:07:41,936
Renu... look at me now.

1362
02:07:45,382 --> 02:07:47,145
He won't recognise me now.

1363
02:07:48,385 --> 02:07:50,683
Even I cannot recognise you!

1364
02:07:50,788 --> 02:07:53,552
Don't laugh!
Or we'll get into trouble.

1365
02:07:53,657 --> 02:07:57,957
Do one thing... Don't laugh!
...change your appearance.

1366
02:07:58,395 --> 02:07:59,862
How do I do that?

1367
02:07:59,964 --> 02:08:02,091
I have an extra set
of clothes. Wear them.

1368
02:08:02,199 --> 02:08:03,860
How can I wear your clothes?

1369
02:08:03,968 --> 02:08:07,870
Don't joke! We'll be
in trouble. Please go.

1370
02:08:10,608 --> 02:08:12,098
Don't laugh!

1371
02:08:22,419 --> 02:08:23,647
- Renu!
- Yes?

1372
02:08:23,754 --> 02:08:25,585
Have you worn them?

1373
02:08:26,423 --> 02:08:28,186
Hurry up. Don't laugh!

1374
02:08:32,630 --> 02:08:34,063
Don't look behind!

1375
02:08:39,436 --> 02:08:42,405
I've worn the clothes...
Hey, you'll cause an accident!

1376
02:08:42,506 --> 02:08:43,996
Come in the front.

1377
02:08:52,950 --> 02:08:55,919
Hey! He has stopped the car.
You also do the same.

1378
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:26,938
Mannu, he's entered the lane.
What we do now?

1379
02:09:27,051 --> 02:09:28,643
- Let's follow him.
- Okay.

1380
02:09:28,752 --> 02:09:32,244
Don't! If he comes back,
then it'll be a big problem.

1381
02:09:32,489 --> 02:09:34,457
- What do we do then?
- What do we do?

1382
02:09:35,292 --> 02:09:37,260
- We'll wait here.
- All right.

1383
02:09:39,496 --> 02:09:41,054
- What's wrong?
- Someone is following me!

1384
02:09:41,799 --> 02:09:45,462
I don't know. But we should
be alert. Where is my disguise?

1385
02:09:45,569 --> 02:09:46,968
I'll get it.

1386
02:09:48,706 --> 02:09:50,469
I'd like to know who they are.

1387
02:09:50,574 --> 02:09:54,476
The car looks familiar.
...ls everything in there?

1388
02:09:54,578 --> 02:09:56,910
You go and stand next to my car.

1389
02:09:57,014 --> 02:09:59,482
I'll disguise myself
and see who they are.

1390
02:09:59,583 --> 02:10:03,212
We have to unload the goods. I
hope the plan doesn't get foiled.

1391
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:05,481
Don't worry. I'll tackle
them in a jiffy! Be ready.

1392
02:10:05,589 --> 02:10:07,056
Okay. And then, we'll go there.

1393
02:10:07,524 --> 02:10:10,288
It's been so long
but he still hasn't returned.

1394
02:10:11,028 --> 02:10:12,495
I don't think he will come now.

1395
02:10:12,596 --> 02:10:13,688
What!

1396
02:10:13,797 --> 02:10:15,697
His car is here.
Why won't he come?

1397
02:10:16,033 --> 02:10:18,501
Renu, it's possible
that their hideout is here.

1398
02:10:19,036 --> 02:10:20,503
Yes!

1399
02:10:21,038 --> 02:10:23,131
They must be surely
having a meeting.

1400
02:10:23,540 --> 02:10:26,008
- Let's inform the police soon.
- Come on!

1401
02:10:56,173 --> 02:10:58,141
What's happening?!

1402
02:11:01,078 --> 02:11:03,376
- What's wrong?
- The tyre is punctured!

1403
02:11:03,580 --> 02:11:05,138
O' dear!

1404
02:11:05,582 --> 02:11:07,812
Hey, the car is leaving!

1405
02:11:37,614 --> 02:11:39,081
You haven't slept as yet?

1406
02:11:39,183 --> 02:11:40,582
- Where were you?
- I had gone out.

1407
02:11:40,684 --> 02:11:43,847
- I asked, where were you?!
- I had some important work.

1408
02:11:44,021 --> 02:11:46,581
You go out with a girl at 1 a.m.
And tell me, it was important!

1409
02:11:47,124 --> 02:11:50,184
- A girl?
- Didn't that girl phone you?

1410
02:11:52,629 --> 02:11:54,597
And hadn't I asked you
not to go?!

1411
02:11:54,698 --> 02:11:55,665
Yes.

1412
02:11:55,766 --> 02:11:58,792
Then why did you go?!
...Answer me!

1413
02:11:59,236 --> 02:12:01,397
Our opinions about girls
do not match.

1414
02:12:01,638 --> 02:12:03,606
- Look at the way he talks!
- Mannu, speak politely!

1415
02:12:03,707 --> 02:12:05,607
- You back answer me!
- No.

1416
02:12:05,709 --> 02:12:07,404
I'll smash your teeth!

1417
02:12:07,644 --> 02:12:11,603
You can smash my teeth
but not snatch my freedom!

1418
02:12:11,715 --> 02:12:14,343
- So you won't heed me?!
- Not if you're wrong!

1419
02:12:14,651 --> 02:12:18,109
- I'll box your ears!
- A fight between two brothers!

1420
02:12:18,655 --> 02:12:20,122
- Bring my boxing gloves.
- Gloves!

1421
02:12:20,924 --> 02:12:23,620
- I won't fight!
- Indeed! You're only a kid!

1422
02:12:23,727 --> 02:12:26,127
You're afraid! You can
only roam out with girls!

1423
02:12:26,663 --> 02:12:29,928
Brother! If you challenge me,
I will surely fight!

1424
02:12:33,670 --> 02:12:37,629
Since you are a boxing champion,
you will use only one hand.

1425
02:12:37,741 --> 02:12:39,641
Give him the gloves!

1426
02:12:40,677 --> 02:12:43,646
Mannu, don't lose this opportunity.
Use both your hands.

1427
02:12:43,947 --> 02:12:45,437
I'm going.

1428
02:12:48,485 --> 02:12:50,453
So, kid, are you ready?

1429
02:12:53,690 --> 02:12:56,158
Mannu, brother knows the rules.
Let me explain them to you.

1430
02:13:11,708 --> 02:13:13,676
You threw brother down!

1431
02:13:30,928 --> 02:13:34,193
- Will you meet that girl again?
- I will!

1432
02:13:36,733 --> 02:13:39,702
- Now say, will you meet her?
- I will!

1433
02:13:46,743 --> 02:13:48,711
I'll be dead!

1434
02:13:49,746 --> 02:13:53,512
You dare hit the referee!
You're disqualified! He hit me!

1435
02:13:53,750 --> 02:13:55,718
Punch him, he's over there.

1436
02:14:46,803 --> 02:14:48,771
- Please take a seat.
- You sit.

1437
02:14:50,807 --> 02:14:53,776
- Please sit.
- You sit. I want to talk to you.

1438
02:14:55,812 --> 02:14:57,575
What's your name? I forgot.

1439
02:14:59,816 --> 02:15:02,785
Renu, please try to understand
whatever I'm going to say.

1440
02:15:02,886 --> 02:15:03,853
Okay.

1441
02:15:03,954 --> 02:15:07,788
You know, we are 3 brothers.
I have raised both of them.

1442
02:15:07,891 --> 02:15:11,793
They have always respected me
but today he didn't heed me.

1443
02:15:11,895 --> 02:15:15,126
I'm talking about Mannu.
And you are responsible.

1444
02:15:15,232 --> 02:15:16,790
- Me?!
- Sit down.

1445
02:15:17,034 --> 02:15:20,800
You are wealthy
and want to enjoy life.

1446
02:15:20,904 --> 02:15:23,236
But I don't want you to
enjoy at my brother's expense.

1447
02:15:23,340 --> 02:15:25,001
- What?
- Listen to me first.

1448
02:15:25,108 --> 02:15:28,805
He is immature. His life could
get ruined... Let me finish.

1449
02:15:29,346 --> 02:15:33,112
Therefore, I want you
to stop meeting him.

1450
02:15:33,850 --> 02:15:35,249
That's it.

1451
02:15:35,352 --> 02:15:36,819
Did you come, only to say this?

1452
02:15:36,920 --> 02:15:40,014
- It's not a petty matter for me.
- Neither is it for me!

1453
02:15:40,123 --> 02:15:42,819
I have never enjoyed
myself at Mannu's cost.

1454
02:15:43,860 --> 02:15:47,421
- I know why you're saying this.
- What do you know?!

1455
02:15:47,864 --> 02:15:50,833
A girl jilted you and hurt you!

1456
02:15:50,934 --> 02:15:53,835
But it does not mean that
all girls are the same!

1457
02:15:53,937 --> 02:15:56,633
When the time comes,
I will prove it!

1458
02:15:56,873 --> 02:15:59,842
All girls are the same! Well,
I don't want to argue with you!

1459
02:15:59,943 --> 02:16:01,911
All I want is for you
to stop meeting Mannu!

1460
02:16:03,880 --> 02:16:05,347
Would that make you happy?

1461
02:16:05,449 --> 02:16:06,848
I'm not talking of my happiness.

1462
02:16:06,950 --> 02:16:08,417
Will Mannu be happy?

1463
02:16:11,888 --> 02:16:16,052
If it makes Mannu happy,
then I will never meet him.

1464
02:16:19,396 --> 02:16:20,863
Listen!

1465
02:16:25,902 --> 02:16:28,871
I could never understand women
nor explain to them!

1466
02:16:28,972 --> 02:16:32,874
I had asked you to understand me
but you have begun to cry.

1467
02:16:34,911 --> 02:16:37,379
Well, I love
my brothers very much.

1468
02:16:37,481 --> 02:16:41,884
If Mannu ever gets hurt the way
I did, then I'll go crazy!

1469
02:16:41,985 --> 02:16:44,681
You know I am a boxer,
and I think like one too.

1470
02:16:47,424 --> 02:16:50,689
I guess I had a
wrong impression about you.

1471
02:16:54,931 --> 02:16:56,489
Wipe your tears.

1472
02:16:57,134 --> 02:16:59,694
And... what's your name? I forgot.

1473
02:17:00,937 --> 02:17:05,101
Renu, don't tell Mannu that I had
come here to discuss all this.

1474
02:17:05,942 --> 02:17:07,910
He's my younger brother.
He will feel bad.

1475
02:17:08,445 --> 02:17:09,912
And...

1476
02:17:10,013 --> 02:17:13,710
And that's all. I'm leaving.
Do what you please.

1477
02:17:13,950 --> 02:17:15,918
You needn't touch my feet.

1478
02:17:30,167 --> 02:17:33,432
It's indeed very unfair!

1479
02:17:33,537 --> 02:17:36,938
Big brother is a boxer. He
can box us whenever he pleases.

1480
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:39,736
What can we younger brothers do?

1481
02:17:39,976 --> 02:17:46,438
Well, if a girl and a boy meet,
what's wrong in that?

1482
02:17:46,983 --> 02:17:49,816
And suppose
they come home late...

1483
02:17:49,986 --> 02:17:52,682
...does it mean they should
get beaten? That's wrong!

1484
02:17:52,789 --> 02:17:55,451
- Will you remain silent?!
- All right!

1485
02:17:55,992 --> 02:18:00,759
How can I remain silent?
...But why did you get late?

1486
02:18:04,301 --> 02:18:06,269
- The tyre got punctured.
- Oh, I see!

1487
02:18:06,369 --> 02:18:09,964
Get lost! The tyre
got puncture, indeed!

1488
02:18:10,073 --> 02:18:12,473
Tell me what happened?
I won't tell anyone.

1489
02:18:12,576 --> 02:18:14,635
Please tell me.
Why did you get late?

1490
02:18:14,745 --> 02:18:15,973
- Shall I?
- Yes.

1491
02:18:16,079 --> 02:18:18,980
Let brother come! I'll tell him,
you were asking me all this!

1492
02:18:19,082 --> 02:18:21,312
Why involve him?
This is unsporting.

1493
02:18:21,418 --> 02:18:22,976
- I'll tell him everything!
- You are being!

1494
02:18:29,025 --> 02:18:31,994
- Brother, he...
- He...

1495
02:18:32,295 --> 02:18:34,195
You keep quiet! You tell me.

1496
02:18:34,297 --> 02:18:38,791
This is unfair. Is it right
to go out with girls at night?

1497
02:18:39,536 --> 02:18:42,505
- But why are you after him?
- I am not.

1498
02:18:43,039 --> 02:18:46,406
You were the one who'd asked us
not to get involved with girls...

1499
02:18:51,348 --> 02:18:54,010
Shall I tell her
that she can't talk to him?

1500
02:18:54,117 --> 02:18:55,812
Give him the phone.

1501
02:18:56,319 --> 02:18:59,015
Wait... Brother, you had said
that we mustn't talk to girls.

1502
02:18:59,122 --> 02:19:01,022
I say, give him the phone!

1503
02:19:05,061 --> 02:19:06,619
Yes, it's me.

1504
02:19:08,064 --> 02:19:10,032
But I have
some important work here.

1505
02:19:10,133 --> 02:19:11,532
What's she saying?

1506
02:19:11,635 --> 02:19:15,036
She says that she has important
work and wants me to come there.

1507
02:19:15,138 --> 02:19:16,867
You can't go, Mannu!

1508
02:19:17,073 --> 02:19:20,236
Why can't he go?! He will go!

1509
02:19:20,577 --> 02:19:22,374
- May I go?
- Yes.

1510
02:19:27,083 --> 02:19:29,051
I'm coming. Wait for me.

1511
02:19:32,589 --> 02:19:34,250
You're gone. Where do I go?

1512
02:19:35,091 --> 02:19:37,059
- Then what happened?
- I stopped my car.

1513
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:41,062
I disguised myself and went back
to check. What I saw, shocked me!

1514
02:19:41,164 --> 02:19:43,496
Renu and the motor mechanic
were in the car!

1515
02:19:43,600 --> 02:19:45,067
- Renu and that boy?
- Yes.

1516
02:19:45,168 --> 02:19:48,069
- But why were they following you?
- That's what I don't understand.

1517
02:19:48,171 --> 02:19:51,072
They must have had some doubt.
What could be the reason?

1518
02:19:51,174 --> 02:19:53,199
Anyway, we must stay alert.

1519
02:19:53,310 --> 02:19:56,074
Boss! It's the same car.

1520
02:20:00,917 --> 02:20:04,876
So they've reached even here.
It means, they're following you.

1521
02:20:05,121 --> 02:20:09,080
Prakash, go to the
house in Versova.

1522
02:20:09,192 --> 02:20:12,593
I'll make some phone calls
and join you soon.

1523
02:20:13,763 --> 02:20:15,731
And let them follow you.

1524
02:20:20,403 --> 02:20:24,100
It's been so long! Neither is
anyone going in nor coming out!

1525
02:20:24,407 --> 02:20:27,103
I think they must be
doing their work at night.

1526
02:20:27,210 --> 02:20:29,303
And sleeping till late
in the morning.

1527
02:20:29,646 --> 02:20:33,309
You reached home late last night.
Did your elder brother scold you?

1528
02:20:33,416 --> 02:20:35,543
- Yes.
- What did he say?

1529
02:20:35,652 --> 02:20:37,119
No, he didn't say a thing.

1530
02:20:37,220 --> 02:20:39,120
He didn't scold you?
Not at all?

1531
02:20:39,222 --> 02:20:40,382
No.

1532
02:20:40,657 --> 02:20:44,457
I was sure your brother would be
furious that you'd returned late.

1533
02:20:44,561 --> 02:20:48,520
Nothing happened. I went home,
ate well and went to sleep.

1534
02:20:48,632 --> 02:20:50,122
- Really?
- Yes.

1535
02:20:51,167 --> 02:20:54,933
In that case, your brother is not
how you describe him to be.

1536
02:20:55,171 --> 02:20:57,935
- Have you seen a coconut?
- Yes, I have.

1537
02:20:58,174 --> 02:21:00,142
My brother is
just like a coconut.

1538
02:21:00,243 --> 02:21:03,144
Hard from outside,
soft from within.

1539
02:21:04,180 --> 02:21:05,943
A car! Stay alert!

1540
02:22:30,133 --> 02:22:31,566
- Renu
- Yes?

1541
02:22:33,770 --> 02:22:36,739
- Are you nervous once again?
- No, I'm not. What do we do now?

1542
02:22:36,873 --> 02:22:39,842
Let's go in. We'll get
more information from inside.

1543
02:22:40,076 --> 02:22:41,441
Fine, but...

1544
02:22:41,544 --> 02:22:46,243
He opened the lock and went in.
So it's obvious that he's alone.

1545
02:22:46,349 --> 02:22:48,647
- But, Renu...
- Are you so scared?

1546
02:22:48,752 --> 02:22:51,243
I'm not afraid for myself
but for you!

1547
02:22:51,354 --> 02:22:53,822
He's alone, and we are
two of us. Let's go.

1548
02:23:33,329 --> 02:23:35,297
This place looks haunted.

1549
02:23:35,398 --> 02:23:38,492
It does seem
as though nobody lives here.

1550
02:23:40,336 --> 02:23:42,497
- Then where did that man go?
- Where did he go?

1551
02:23:44,541 --> 02:23:46,099
What's happening?

1552
02:23:47,343 --> 02:23:49,311
It seems as if
somebody is walking upstairs.

1553
02:23:50,847 --> 02:23:52,644
- What do we do now?
- Let's go there.

1554
02:23:58,354 --> 02:24:01,118
Leave us!

1555
02:24:02,025 --> 02:24:04,926
Take them upstairs
and tie them up firmly!

1556
02:24:05,361 --> 02:24:06,988
Leave us!

1557
02:24:09,866 --> 02:24:12,835
Brother Jaggu! Help us!

1558
02:24:13,369 --> 02:24:15,837
Brother Jaggu! Help!

1559
02:24:29,986 --> 02:24:32,352
I have had both of them
tied in the room upstairs.

1560
02:24:32,455 --> 02:24:34,855
Good! Did anybody follow you?

1561
02:24:37,393 --> 02:24:39,020
- Prakash.
- Yes?

1562
02:24:39,195 --> 02:24:41,356
- Will you get married?
- To Renu?!

1563
02:24:41,464 --> 02:24:44,365
- Right now?
- I am ready.

1564
02:24:44,901 --> 02:24:49,361
Fetch the registrar. And yes,
we'll need Mr. Kishanchand too.

1565
02:24:49,472 --> 02:24:53,875
Anyway, I'll call him. Leave now,
while I go and talk to them.

1566
02:25:14,430 --> 02:25:16,830
I hope you were
looked after properly?

1567
02:25:16,933 --> 02:25:18,400
Yes, we were.

1568
02:25:19,435 --> 02:25:21,665
Hey, I've seen you somewhere!

1569
02:25:24,240 --> 02:25:27,209
Renu! Why did you need
to disguise yourself?

1570
02:25:28,745 --> 02:25:30,906
Oh? I understand.

1571
02:25:31,447 --> 02:25:34,211
You like the prince
so much that you can't stay...

1572
02:25:34,384 --> 02:25:36,215
I hate the very sight of him!

1573
02:25:36,319 --> 02:25:38,412
But how can that be? You will
be getting married to him.

1574
02:25:38,521 --> 02:25:41,012
She has no intentions of
getting married to a murderer!

1575
02:25:42,458 --> 02:25:44,426
Murderer? What do you mean?

1576
02:25:44,527 --> 02:25:45,926
- Your brother is a murderer!
- Mohan!

1577
02:25:46,029 --> 02:25:47,428
- Says who?
- Says me!

1578
02:25:50,033 --> 02:25:51,625
Who's he?

1579
02:25:54,470 --> 02:25:57,928
Oh! So, he is your lover?

1580
02:25:59,676 --> 02:26:02,440
Don't laugh. I can take
your brother to the gallows!

1581
02:26:02,979 --> 02:26:05,447
Oh! How?

1582
02:26:05,582 --> 02:26:08,244
I saw him dump Lalchand's
dead body out of the car.

1583
02:26:13,489 --> 02:26:15,457
Your life is over now.

1584
02:26:15,558 --> 02:26:20,257
No! Spare him! I promise,
he won't say a word to anyone!

1585
02:26:20,496 --> 02:26:22,464
Quiet! Please!

1586
02:26:24,500 --> 02:26:28,800
If you want to save his life,
then marry Prakash.

1587
02:26:29,505 --> 02:26:31,473
What! Never!

1588
02:26:31,574 --> 02:26:35,476
I'd consider it better to die
than to marry that wretched man!

1589
02:26:35,578 --> 02:26:38,138
Correct! Don't bother
about his threats!

1590
02:26:39,716 --> 02:26:42,480
You will get married
to Prakash tonight itself.

1591
02:26:42,819 --> 02:26:46,152
And if you don't agree,
you will be coerced into it.

1592
02:26:46,322 --> 02:26:48,620
I give you 15 minutes to think.

1593
02:26:48,725 --> 02:26:50,693
By then, even your father
will be here.

1594
02:26:51,027 --> 02:26:52,494
- My father?
- Yes.

1595
02:26:52,595 --> 02:26:55,291
He will come here
to bless the couple.

1596
02:26:56,532 --> 02:26:57,999
Understand?

1597
02:27:00,536 --> 02:27:02,026
Wretched man!

1598
02:27:02,138 --> 02:27:03,935
Now what?

1599
02:27:04,040 --> 02:27:05,507
That rogue won't spare me alive!

1600
02:27:05,608 --> 02:27:09,510
Please don't say that. You've
got into trouble because of me.

1601
02:27:09,612 --> 02:27:11,512
No, Renu. It's my fault.

1602
02:27:11,614 --> 02:27:14,515
If I hadn't let you come here, we
wouldn't have got into trouble.

1603
02:27:14,817 --> 02:27:17,718
Mohan, is there no way
we can escape from here?

1604
02:27:18,154 --> 02:27:20,315
- No, we can't.
- We can't?

1605
02:27:21,557 --> 02:27:23,320
What are you thinking of?

1606
02:27:23,559 --> 02:27:28,826
If we are destined to die,
then let's die together.

1607
02:27:29,065 --> 02:27:30,726
But why do you want to die?

1608
02:27:31,567 --> 02:27:33,535
What will I do
living without you?

1609
02:27:33,636 --> 02:27:36,537
Without me?
I don't quite understand, Renu.

1610
02:27:36,839 --> 02:27:39,865
I'd thought you do understand.

1611
02:27:40,576 --> 02:27:42,737
I often thought of telling you.

1612
02:27:43,780 --> 02:27:45,941
But I couldn't!

1613
02:27:46,082 --> 02:27:48,050
And when you did say,
it was before dying!

1614
02:27:52,588 --> 02:27:54,215
I don't want to die now.

1615
02:28:06,602 --> 02:28:10,561
It's easy to get trapped
but very difficult to escape.

1616
02:28:12,108 --> 02:28:14,576
- Who are you?
- Me?

1617
02:28:14,677 --> 02:28:18,374
Like you, I too have been trapped
in the clutches of these demons!

1618
02:28:18,614 --> 02:28:21,082
- How?
- What's the use of hearing it?

1619
02:28:21,250 --> 02:28:25,380
It's a very long story.
But who are you?

1620
02:28:26,923 --> 02:28:30,381
I am Mr. Kishanchand's
daughter - Renu.

1621
02:28:30,626 --> 02:28:32,594
You're the only child, right?

1622
02:28:32,695 --> 02:28:37,598
Yes. Help us. This cruel man is
forcing me to marry his brother.

1623
02:28:37,700 --> 02:28:39,099
Marry?

1624
02:28:39,202 --> 02:28:40,601
I understand.

1625
02:28:40,703 --> 02:28:45,402
He was successful once. And he's
playing the same trick again.

1626
02:28:45,641 --> 02:28:47,404
I have seen you somewhere.

1627
02:28:47,643 --> 02:28:49,907
Me? Where?

1628
02:28:51,914 --> 02:28:54,109
I don't remember.

1629
02:28:56,652 --> 02:28:58,210
But I have surely seen you.

1630
02:28:58,654 --> 02:29:00,019
Surely?

1631
02:29:03,659 --> 02:29:06,628
Nobody has seen me
since the last 10 years.

1632
02:29:07,663 --> 02:29:10,029
I have been in captivity
since 10 years.

1633
02:29:10,333 --> 02:29:14,429
Since 10 years,
no one ever heard my pleas.

1634
02:29:15,171 --> 02:29:17,639
And you say that
you have seen me?

1635
02:29:19,942 --> 02:29:21,637
You are crazy!

1636
02:29:21,944 --> 02:29:25,641
I remembered! The picture!
...Mannu, the picture!

1637
02:29:25,748 --> 02:29:28,216
- She resembles the woman in it!
- Which picture?

1638
02:29:28,351 --> 02:29:31,650
The picture that I'd found under
your brother Brijmohan's pillow.

1639
02:29:35,691 --> 02:29:38,660
- Do you know him?
- He is his younger brother.

1640
02:29:38,761 --> 02:29:40,228
Are you his brother?

1641
02:29:40,696 --> 02:29:44,655
Yes, you do look like him.
Where is he?

1642
02:29:47,703 --> 02:29:50,103
Help us. Please release us.

1643
02:29:50,206 --> 02:29:52,674
All right, I'll untie you.

1644
02:30:03,219 --> 02:30:05,119
I think someone is coming.

1645
02:30:05,221 --> 02:30:08,679
Don't worry. The moment I get a
chance, I'll come to untie you.

1646
02:31:13,990 --> 02:31:15,150
Come.

1647
02:31:17,793 --> 02:31:19,260
This way, please.

1648
02:31:22,798 --> 02:31:24,095
Upstairs.

1649
02:31:35,811 --> 02:31:38,279
- Welcome!
- You here?

1650
02:31:38,381 --> 02:31:41,282
- How's Renu?
- She is fine.

1651
02:31:41,384 --> 02:31:43,215
But which hospital is this?

1652
02:31:43,319 --> 02:31:44,786
This is a house, not a hospital.

1653
02:31:45,021 --> 02:31:47,785
But they told me that Renu
had met with a car accident.

1654
02:31:47,890 --> 02:31:49,858
And that she is in hospital.

1655
02:31:49,959 --> 02:31:52,393
Please sit down.
There's no need to worry.

1656
02:31:52,495 --> 02:31:56,795
But I don't understand why they
brought me here in this fashion.

1657
02:31:56,899 --> 02:32:01,802
We thought your presence was
needed on this joyous occasion.

1658
02:32:01,904 --> 02:32:04,395
Joyous occasion?
What are you talking about?

1659
02:32:04,507 --> 02:32:06,998
I am getting Prakash
married to Renu.

1660
02:32:07,243 --> 02:32:09,609
What! How can that be possible?!

1661
02:32:09,845 --> 02:32:13,303
I'm sorry but we were
forced to rush things up.

1662
02:32:13,416 --> 02:32:14,815
I have called the magistrate.

1663
02:32:14,917 --> 02:32:18,250
But I still don't know
what is Renu's wish!

1664
02:32:18,854 --> 02:32:22,813
I do. And I also know that
you cannot live without her.

1665
02:32:22,925 --> 02:32:25,826
Therefore, I've made arrangements
for you to live with Renu.

1666
02:32:25,928 --> 02:32:29,830
What's happening? Where is Renu?!

1667
02:32:29,932 --> 02:32:31,627
- Renu?
- Yes.

1668
02:32:33,469 --> 02:32:36,836
She'll be here soon.
You are our guest.

1669
02:32:36,939 --> 02:32:39,430
You will be
looked after properly.

1670
02:32:39,542 --> 02:32:41,840
You will only have to
take a little trouble.

1671
02:32:41,944 --> 02:32:43,639
You can't leave from here.

1672
02:32:44,380 --> 02:32:47,144
That's no big deal. You'll
get used to it in a few days.

1673
02:32:47,883 --> 02:32:49,851
Please be seated.

1674
02:32:51,487 --> 02:32:54,285
Excuse me! Is Brijmohan here?

1675
02:32:54,390 --> 02:32:57,655
Yes, he is working.
Can I help you?

1676
02:32:58,160 --> 02:33:02,597
Could you please call him?
Do hurry. It's urgent.

1677
02:33:02,698 --> 02:33:03,665
All right.

1678
02:33:03,899 --> 02:33:05,867
Brother!

1679
02:33:06,168 --> 02:33:08,363
What's the matter, Jaggu?
Any news about Mannu?

1680
02:33:28,424 --> 02:33:29,891
Recognised me?

1681
02:33:31,927 --> 02:33:33,690
After 10 years...

1682
02:33:33,929 --> 02:33:38,093
You must have never thought
that you'd see me in this state.

1683
02:33:38,934 --> 02:33:43,701
You must have never even thought
how I spent these 10 years.

1684
02:33:43,939 --> 02:33:47,102
Well, never mind.
Come with me quickly.

1685
02:33:47,443 --> 02:33:49,911
- With you?
- I'm not saying this for myself.

1686
02:33:50,012 --> 02:33:52,344
Your brother's life
is in danger.

1687
02:33:52,448 --> 02:33:54,416
Manmohan? What's
happened to him?

1688
02:33:54,517 --> 02:33:56,712
There's no time to answer. Hurry!

1689
02:33:56,952 --> 02:33:58,419
Get the car.

1690
02:33:59,955 --> 02:34:01,115
My dear!

1691
02:34:02,958 --> 02:34:06,917
- These devils brought you here?
- Yes, my child. Don't worry.

1692
02:34:07,029 --> 02:34:09,520
Daddy, they are rogues
and very dangerous!

1693
02:34:09,632 --> 02:34:10,929
I know.

1694
02:34:11,033 --> 02:34:13,365
But it's no use now.

1695
02:34:13,469 --> 02:34:16,131
It will be in your good
to get Renu married to Prakash.

1696
02:34:16,238 --> 02:34:21,232
Never! I will never let
my child marry a scoundrel!

1697
02:34:21,477 --> 02:34:24,935
If you love Renu, you'll surely
let the wedding take place.

1698
02:34:25,047 --> 02:34:26,378
Never!

1699
02:34:26,482 --> 02:34:28,950
Good girls don't go against
the wishes of their fathers.

1700
02:34:29,051 --> 02:34:30,678
Your father will give you away.

1701
02:34:30,786 --> 02:34:34,950
Never! I won't get my daughter
married without her consent!

1702
02:34:35,057 --> 02:34:36,752
- You won't?
- No!

1703
02:34:41,497 --> 02:34:44,466
Leave my daddy!

1704
02:34:44,734 --> 02:34:46,463
I say, leave him!

1705
02:34:46,602 --> 02:34:48,570
- Say yes!
- Don't, Renu!

1706
02:34:50,005 --> 02:34:53,463
- Leave him!
- Don't, Renu! Certainly don't!

1707
02:34:55,411 --> 02:34:57,777
- Two gallons of petrol, please.
- Yes, madam.

1708
02:35:02,818 --> 02:35:04,979
- Two gallons of petrol. Hurry!
- Coming, sir.

1709
02:35:06,021 --> 02:35:08,251
I've understood
everything, Kamini.

1710
02:35:08,524 --> 02:35:13,985
And today, after 10 years, I'm
glad that I was wrong about you.

1711
02:35:16,031 --> 02:35:17,498
Hurry up.

1712
02:35:23,038 --> 02:35:24,300
You?

1713
02:35:28,544 --> 02:35:30,512
What happened?

1714
02:36:17,693 --> 02:36:21,060
I'll count three and
give you time to think.

1715
02:36:21,163 --> 02:36:26,396
The answer should be positive or
a bullet will be fired... there.

1716
02:36:28,370 --> 02:36:29,667
Start thinking.

1717
02:36:43,118 --> 02:36:44,745
One!

1718
02:36:49,325 --> 02:36:52,488
- Two!
- Wait! Say yes, my child.

1719
02:36:52,595 --> 02:36:55,428
Or this poor boy will
unnecessarily lose his life.

1720
02:36:55,731 --> 02:36:57,198
Don't, Renu! Don't!

1721
02:36:59,134 --> 02:37:00,897
- Don't, Renu!
- Y... y... yes.

1722
02:37:02,137 --> 02:37:03,900
Very good!

1723
02:37:06,141 --> 02:37:07,904
Take him over there.

1724
02:37:13,349 --> 02:37:14,907
Sit down.

1725
02:37:30,165 --> 02:37:32,725
Stop crying now
and listen to me carefully.

1726
02:37:33,168 --> 02:37:38,629
Quietly sign the papers
that will be here soon.

1727
02:37:38,741 --> 02:37:40,333
Or this poor boy...

1728
02:37:41,477 --> 02:37:42,876
...will be killed.

1729
02:37:45,180 --> 02:37:46,704
- Brother!
- Beware!

1730
02:38:31,226 --> 02:38:33,387
Hail Lord Hanuman!

1731
02:39:10,466 --> 02:39:11,763
Damn you!

1732
02:39:28,283 --> 02:39:30,046
Mannu, it's me!

1733
02:39:30,419 --> 02:39:31,909
Where am I?

1734
02:39:57,312 --> 02:39:59,075
You betrayed me!

1735
02:40:00,315 --> 02:40:02,078
You cheat!

1736
02:40:02,317 --> 02:40:04,478
No! Don't!

1737
02:41:00,375 --> 02:41:04,141
- Who will rescue you now?
- Brother! Let's run!

1738
02:41:34,409 --> 02:41:37,173
Sit down, and stop screaming.

1739
02:41:37,412 --> 02:41:39,380
Let me put some iodine.
It will be all right.

1740
02:41:39,481 --> 02:41:41,381
O' God! What a nasty cut!

1741
02:41:41,483 --> 02:41:42,973
It's thanks to you.

1742
02:41:43,085 --> 02:41:45,883
First, you hurt me and then
soothe it with iodine. Let go!

1743
02:41:47,623 --> 02:41:48,988
I'll be dead!

1744
02:41:50,759 --> 02:41:53,193
- May I say something, sir?
- Yes?

1745
02:41:53,729 --> 02:41:57,688
I think Mannu & Renu shouldn't be
separated. If you don't object...

1746
02:41:57,866 --> 02:42:01,597
If they're willing, none can stop
the bride & groom from being one!

1747
02:42:01,703 --> 02:42:03,898
- Why should I object?
- That's right.

1748
02:42:04,439 --> 02:42:07,533
Brother, what about me?

1749
02:42:07,643 --> 02:42:09,008
What happened to you?

1750
02:42:09,444 --> 02:42:12,413
You've got your love...
Mannu too has found his.

1751
02:42:12,514 --> 02:42:14,209
What about me now?

1752
02:42:19,454 --> 02:42:20,614
Ask her.

1753
02:42:22,057 --> 02:42:27,620
Listen... brother wants to know
if you will... marry me.

1754
02:42:28,463 --> 02:42:31,830
If you don't marry me, I'll be
left alone. Don't leave me alone.

1755
02:42:31,934 --> 02:42:35,426
Tell brother and everyone
that you love me like crazy.

1756
02:42:35,537 --> 02:42:36,765
Stop it!

1757
02:42:37,472 --> 02:42:38,939
She says, stop it!

1758
02:42:39,141 --> 02:42:40,768
It means yes.

1759
02:42:41,009 --> 02:42:42,943
Yes?! Come on!

1760
02:42:43,478 --> 02:42:45,105
- Hey, leave me!
- I won't!

1761
02:42:45,280 --> 02:42:48,249
Shameless boy! You hold a
girl's hand in front of me?!

1762
02:42:49,484 --> 02:42:50,951
- Decided?
- Yes.

1763
02:42:51,053 --> 02:42:52,850
- Happy?
- Yes, I am.

1764
02:42:52,955 --> 02:42:54,650
- Then let's go home.
- Really?!

1765
02:42:54,756 --> 02:42:56,951
- May I bring her along?
- Yes, you may.

1766
02:43:00,495 --> 02:43:02,861
That's enough, my son.
...Go, my dear.
