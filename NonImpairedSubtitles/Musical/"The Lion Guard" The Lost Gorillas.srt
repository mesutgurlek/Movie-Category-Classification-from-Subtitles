00:19:29,224 --> 00:19:30,457
Whoo-hoo!

496
00:19:30,492 --> 00:19:32,092
Hang on, Kion!

497
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:33,260
Good advice, brother!

498
00:19:33,295 --> 00:19:34,327
(BOTH GRUNT)

499
00:19:35,163 --> 00:19:36,196
(SCREAMS)

500
00:19:36,231 --> 00:19:37,264
I can't look!

501
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:38,299
(GRUNTS)

502
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:42,803
(PANTS) You saved me.

503
00:19:43,069 --> 00:19:44,120
Thanks.

504
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,139
Pfft! No thanks needed.

505
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,538
It was fun!

506
00:19:47,639 --> 00:19:50,184
Oh no! It was more than that.

507
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,520
It was brave.

508
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:53,899
Doing something like that
is what you makes you

509
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,242
prince material.

510
00:19:56,351 --> 00:19:58,351
You really think
we have that in us?

511
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,703
The prince thing?

512
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:01,371
Totally.

513
00:20:02,571 --> 00:20:03,922
SOKWE: So...

514
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,304
You forgot my message
to King Simba!

515
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,938
BOTH: Yes, Poppa.

516
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:13,433
And you got lost coming home
from the Pride Lands!

517
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,187
BOTH: Yes, Poppa.

518
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:20,507
And you needed the Lion Guard
to help you get back home!

519
00:20:20,578 --> 00:20:22,070
BOTH: Yes, Poppa.

520
00:20:22,162 --> 00:20:25,929
You know what this means.

521
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,570
BOTH: Yes, Poppa.

522
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:29,124
(SOFTLY) What do
you think it means?

523
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:30,765
Nothing too bad, I hope.

524

526
00:20:42,431 --> 00:20:44,531
SOKWE: Kion told me
how you saved him.

527
00:20:44,674 --> 00:20:47,026
I'm proud of you both.

528
00:20:47,156 --> 00:20:50,323
You are true gorilla princes.

529
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,006
BOTH: Thank you, Poppa.

530
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:55,379
Um, speaking of your
message for my dad?

531
00:20:55,477 --> 00:20:57,510
We do need to give it to him.

532
00:20:57,608 --> 00:21:00,193
Of course you do. (LAUGHS)

533
00:21:00,306 --> 00:21:05,076
I see your friend has
a souvenir from our home.

534
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,319
Sure do!

535
00:21:06,355 --> 00:21:09,065
Uh... Your Gorilla-ness!

536
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,572
Is that's a problem?

537
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:11,823
No, no.

538
00:21:11,893 --> 00:21:13,159
Not at all.

539
00:21:13,228 --> 00:21:15,643
In fact, it's perfect.

540
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:18,799
KION: And, so...

541
00:21:18,995 --> 00:21:20,034
Here we are.

542
00:21:20,098 --> 00:21:24,304
And did you bring back
King Sokwe's message?

543
00:21:24,635 --> 00:21:26,557
Uh, yeah...

544
00:21:26,642 --> 00:21:27,838
Well, then?

545
00:21:27,924 --> 00:21:29,103
It's just...

546
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:31,299
Kion? I need the message.

547
00:21:31,471 --> 00:21:32,572
Are you sure?

548
00:21:32,627 --> 00:21:34,381
Yes! You have to give it to me!

549
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,603
