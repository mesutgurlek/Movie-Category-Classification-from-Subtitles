- What are you studying?
- Psychology.

3
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,836
- And you, dear?
- Philosophy.

4
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,070
Well, don't take it too seriously,

5
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,994
- Because I know a professor of great renown.
- Yes?

6
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,312
* And he is the loneliest man in town

7

Really?

8
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,511
* He's as smart as a man can be

9
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,160
* But he never has company

10
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,233
* Why is he the loneliest man in town?

11
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,957
Huh?

12
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,032
- * He ain't got rhythm
- Oh.

13
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,634
* Every night he sits in the house alone

14
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,518
- * Cos he ain't got rhythm
- Too bad.

15
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,832
* Every night he sits there and wears a frown

16
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,480
* He attracted some attention

17
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,915
* When he found the fourth dimension

18
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,992
* But he ain't got rhythm so no one's with him

* The loneliest man in town

- * Bending over his books
- He would.

22
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,430
* His wife and family

23
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,590
* Keep giving him dirty looks

24
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,353
* Cos he ain't got rhythm

25
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,431
* When they call him up,
it's to call him down

26
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,750
* In the month of January

27
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,593
* He compiles his dictionary

28
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,513
* But he ain't got rhythm so no one's with him

29

* The loneliest man in town

30

* He's lonely, he's lonesome
and he's all by his own-some

31
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,714
* The loneliest man in town

32
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,551
* I know every planet up in the sky

33
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,711
* I've measured them all with my naked eye

34
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,870
* And I've seen everything up in Mars

35
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,475
* I know all about falling stars

36
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,759
* But still I'm a very unhappy guy

37
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,673
* I wonder why

38
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,399
* You ain't got rhythm

39
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,119
* I can read the tea leaves in my cup

40

* But you ain't got rhythm

41
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,517
* And I just found out how high is up

42

* But you ain't got rhythm

43
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,277
* I discovered once while sober

44
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,670
* Where the flies go in October

45
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,309
* For what I found out about the fly

46
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,709
* I got the Nobel prize

47
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,439
* But you can't do the Charleston

48
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,991
* And you don't know
how to do the Black Bottom, the new rhythm

49
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,551
* Heaven, I see heaven

50
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,794
* Through my telescope while gazing
from Mount Wilson's highest peak

51
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,034
* I'll explain it all in Latin or in Greek

52
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,511
* But you're not so hot
while dancing cheek to cheek

53
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,475
* I've mastered relativity

54
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,869
* But when they ask it's liberty

55
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,033
- * They never think of asking me
- * Don't you wonder why?

56
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,350
* Cos you don't know how to do the rumba

57
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,351
* That's the reason you're a lonely guy

58
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,719
* Ah, love

59
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,475
* Venus is lovely tonight

60
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,950
* And so is Jupiter

61
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,112
* Jupiter's skipping from planet to planet

* Jumping Jupiter

63
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,270
* But you couldn't be stupider,
cos you ain't got rhythm

64
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,555
* Why, I discovered liquid air

65
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,757

- * And I've a cure for falling hair

66
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,910

- What?

67
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,195
- * No, you can't get hot
- What?

68
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,396
* I'm a scientist to my fingertips

69
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,710
* But you can't do nothing with your hips

70
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,268
* That's the thing we miss

71
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,555
- You mean this?
- Yes!

72

Yes, Father.

H-h-hello, Mimi?

Your explorer friend is late for dinner.
Where is he?

Daddy dear,
I need a little pin money to go shopping.

Could you let me have about 50 or 60,000?

What did you do with the 73,000
I gave you last week?

- Oh, Daddy, if you're going to be like that.
- Shh!

Mr Sims, the famous Arctic explorer.

99

Besides, seals never followed me.

Commodore, I want you to meet
Dr Cotzopole, who discovered the tadpole.

In this corner at 125, I want you to meet

- Wait a minute.

Gentlemen, may I present my daughter Mimi?

104
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,430
I have been thinking, and I have decided
to finance your next expedition to the Arctic.

105
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,990
- Well, that's fine. I'll go to the South Pole.
- Oh. But, darling,

106
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,913
the South Pole has been discovered.

107
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,913
Been discovered?
Well, well, then I'll rediscover it.

108
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,151
What will you give me
if I name a mountain after you in the north?

109
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,038
- One million dollars.
- Take nothing less than 100,000.

110
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,079
- Or be gypped, eh?
- And... and my daughter's hand.

111
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,152
- Swell, I'll take this one.
- Let it go, let it go.

112
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,789
- Commodore, how old is your daughter?
- She's 16 years old today.

113
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,155
16?!

114
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,312
- 16!
- Well, well, well.

115
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,631
I'd like to congratulate you, Commodore.

Tell me, Commodore...

119

Father, let's go.

120
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,798
- Where's the manager?
- Standing over there, sir.

121
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,114
Are you the manager of this show?

122
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,671
Yes. I hope you enjoyed the show.

123
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,116
How dare you permit
such an impertinent exhibition!

124
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,637
Is there anything funny about my expeditions
to the Arctic or about the North Pole?

125
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,280
- Now, now, it's all in fun.
- Fun, indeed!

126
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,079
My attorneys will show you
how much fun it is!

127
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,072
The whole thing is an outrage.
A blasted outrage!

128
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,392
A man of my reputation! Three voyages
to the pole to be made an object of ridicule.

129
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,632
- I won't stand for it, you hear?
- I'm going to bring suit against this show.

130
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,077
And I shall see the mayor, the governor,
and if necessary, I shall go to Washington.

131
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,752
- You wish to see someone?
- Yes, I want to see Mr Blake. Mr Gary Blake.

132
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:27,710
I'm sorry, Miss, but you can't see Mr Blake
while the performance is on.

133
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,590
I'm Miss Caraway. Now may I see him?

134
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,312
I think it can be arranged, Miss Caraway.
I'll tell Mr Blake you're here.

135
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,076
- No, I'll go in alone. I want to surprise him.
- Oh, I see.

136
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,512
- Where's Mr Blake's dressing room?
- Right there where the star is.

137
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,355
But I wouldn't advise no further than the
door on account of he's changing costumes.

138
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,908
- Changing...
- <i>(man)</i> Come in.

139
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,236
Lady must know Mr Blake.
I'll leave them alone.

140
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,631
Oh, how do you do?

141
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,114
That's what I think of you.

142
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,839
Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

143
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,677
As much as I'd like to spar,
I'm a little short of time.

144
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,548
- Well, I'm not short of words!
- Sorry, I've got to change my trousers.

145
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,995
You're ignorant and stupid!

146
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,390
Nevertheless, I still
have to change my trousers.

147
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,632
You not only made my father look ridiculous,
but you made a fantastic fool out of me!

148
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,792
I'm sorry if the sketch offended you.
No harm was intended.

149
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,919
- How dare you make fun of my private life!
- You have none. You're like a goldfish.

150
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,310
- What?!
- Everybody knows about Mimi Caraway.

151
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,472
Does that give you permission
to make fun of me? My life's my own!

152
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,757
You're a public character,
like Mae West or Max Schmeling.

153
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,719
- When you powder your nose it's news.
- I'm not interested in your opinions.

154
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,078
I order you to take the sketch out of the show.
Immediately! Do you hear me?

155
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,151
- Listen, I'm only an actor.
- A what?

156
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,596
- I make faces for a living.
- And very bad ones, if you ask me.

157
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,753
Something tells me you didn't like
the performance. I'll get your money back.

158
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,831
You impudent upstart!

159
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,436
I'll tell you what you are. You're the poorest
sport I ever had the misfortune to bump into.

160
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,274
I haven't begun to say what I think of you.
For two cents, I'd slap your face.

161
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,555
You've already done that.

162
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,352
- Goodbye, Miss Caraway. Such a lovely girl.
- Hey! Put me down! Put me down!

163
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,913
Joe! I got something for you.
Put this back in its penthouse.

164
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,231
You've got to be quiet.
There's a show going on out there.

165
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,233
- I'm going to stop your show.
- Please be quiet. The audience will hear you.

166
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,915
I will not! If you don't take that sketch off,
I'll yell my head off.

167
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,639
- Quiet!
- Don't you dare tell me to be quiet!

168
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,111
- Out in the alley, Joe.
- Will you...? Agh! Put me down!

169
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,633
Put me down!
I'll have you all arrested for this, you beasts!

170
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,756
Let me in! Let me in! Let me in!

171
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,512
If I ever see that gal again,
show me the nearest exit.

172
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,276
- She had a nerve slapping your face.
- She let me have it.

173
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,477
I don't like the idea of any woman hitting you.

174
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,551
Except me.

175
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,072
Excuse me.

176
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,191
<i>(dogs bark)</i>

177
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,952
Get down! Get down, I tell you! Get down!

178
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,918
Go on out of here.

179
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,275
Get down! Down!

180
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,828
Get down! Down, I tell you! Get down!

181
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,718
All right! Down! Down!

182
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,518
- Morning, Father.
- Good morning, Miss Caraway.

183
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,068
I love to see you
having a good romp with the dogs.

184
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,833
How often must I ask you
to get rid of those elephants?

185
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,115
- How's your indigestion?
- All right.

186
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,034
Well, here's something in Winchell's column
that ought to cheer you up.

187
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,351
"Mimi Caraway was so burned up
over Blake's burlesque of horror

188
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,830
on her father and Frederick Sims,
the publicity-loving explorer,

189
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,913
that she rushed backstage last night
and slapped his face."

190
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,912
"The sketch, which is very funny,
is the hit of the show,

191
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,390
and if the Caraways aren't laughing,
everyone else in town is."

192
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,313
There you are. All New York is laughing at us.

193
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,439
Yes. And 13 of my friends called me up
this morning, so I'd be sure not to miss it.

194
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,556
You're a lawyer. Do something.

195
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,710
Well, are we going to sue the theatre?

196
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,234
- I don't believe we have...
- We're going to sue.

197
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,073
- We're going to sue everybody.
- Mr Sims.

198
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,392
Good morning. Good morning, everyone.
And how is everyone this morning?

199
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,031
- If you're going to be cheerful, I can't bear it.
- The whole town is laughing at us.

200
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,113
- I've thought over that trifling little affair.
- Trifling little affair?

201
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,351
- I've decided to rise above it.
- You're going to rise above it?

202
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,319
A man of my reputation should not
be disturbed by such nonsense.

203
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,712
- Is the polar bear disturbed by the house fly?
- We can't all be polar bears.

204
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,155
That's what I want to talk to you about.

205
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,631
Mrs Peters.

206
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,869
Ta-da!

207
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,951
<i>(hums)</i>

208
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,236
What in heaven's name are you doing
in that fantastic costume?

209
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,788
- I've gone Russian.
- You've gone crazy.

210
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,670
A while ago you made a spectacle of yourself
with jujitsu and tap dancing, now it's Russian.

211
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,117
I have to keep myself occupied. Some women
get married again. Others get rheumatism.

212
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,512
I'm studying Russian ballet. Keeps my mind
off my relatives. Not you, Mimi.

213
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,239
- Oh, thank you, Aunt Fritz.
- Well, I got your SOS.

214
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,710
What are you having hysterics about now?

215
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,676
- Have you seen this?
- Oh, is that all?

216
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,548
All? Do you realise
that our family honour has been outraged?

217
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,552
Family honour? Popcorn and peanuts.

218
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,555
Your grandfather was a horse thief.

219
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,518
Oh, Dad, that's where I get my love of horses.

220
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,718
Well, my dear sister,
if you are not concerned about this, I am.

221
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,358
People in the public eye
must expect to be caricatured.

222
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,510
That is the price of fame.

223
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,039
I want you to bring a suit against that show.

224
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,749
I've thought the matter over. I can find
no ground on which to base a suit.

225
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,755
Oh, ridiculous. Why, that fellow in the sketch
had a chinpiece exactly like mine.

226
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,196
Take the case of <i>Finnegan</i>
versus <i>Society Scandals</i> maga...

227
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,919
I don't want to hear
about Finnegans or magazines!

228
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,797
Father, Father, your nerves.

229
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,112
The trouble with you
is you don't get enough exercise.

230
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,876
How can I cope with this situation with
you leaping around like a blasted gazelle?

231
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,396
If you had a sense of humour,
you'd laugh at that sketch and forget it.

232
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,155
Now, what was that fourth position? Oh, yes.

233
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,353
Well, I refuse to laugh at it
and I refuse to forget it. I'm going to sue!

234
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,477
- My dear Commodore, you...
- I'm not your dear commodore!

235
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,270
- I'm not anybody's dear commodore!
- Commodore, this has just arrived.

236
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,793
Ohh!

237
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,110
Isn't she a little daisy?

238
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,589
Oh, I can just see you sitting in your bathtub

239
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,150
sailing that pretty little boat
in a rough sea of soap suds.

240
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,792
This is a model of the <i>Cup Defender</i>,
with which I expect to race against England.

241
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,519
It looks like you might
win the race with that boat.

242
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,878
Are you still here? I thought I told you
to sue that theatre. Well, do it!

243
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,873
You have no grounds for a suit.
I've been trying to convince you of that.

244
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,713
I'm going to bring suit
if it's the last thing I ever do.

245
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,509
- Now, you go and tell 'em I'm bringing suit.
- All right.

246
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,749
Mr Trivet.

247
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,036
Mr Trivet, are you sure
we don't stand a chance suing them?

248
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,035
If we take this to court, the newspapers
will make a farce of the whole thing.

249
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,193
If your father calms down,
tell him I suggest he forget the matter.

250
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,953
- He called me a poor sport.
- Who called you that?

251
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,508
Gary Blake.

252
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,591
A poor sport, am I?

253
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,511
I'll show him.

<i>(applause)</i>

305
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,391
- There's a note from a lady, Mr Blake.
- More fan mail.

306
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,471
Hey, listen to this.

307
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,315
"Dear Mr Blake, when you called me
a poor sport, I was too angry to argue,

308
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,757
but now I've had a chance to cool off and I'd
like to prove to you that you are wrong."

309
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:17,118
"How about supper tonight?"
Signed Mimi Caraway. What do you think?

310
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,839
- She wants something.
- I'll tell you something.

311
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,198
Whether they got a million dollars or work
in a store, that dame is after publicity.

312
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,317
Oh, I don't think so.
She probably wants to say she's sorry.

313
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,678
But the lady is still waiting,
wanting an answer, Mr Blake.

314
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,878
- The lady wants an answer?
- Yeah, she's here.

315
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,351
- Now, what will we tell the lady?
- She's got a big car.

316
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,834
Tell the lady "Why not?"

317
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,911
Why not how, Mr Blake?

318
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,434
Tell the lady "Why not?"

319
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,115
Why not? Why not.

320
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,839
You're letting yourself in for another slap.

321
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,708
Don't worry. This time I'll duck. I hope.

<i>(whistles)</i>

323
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,754
- Hey, there.
- Oh, hello, Mona.

324
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,993
Say, you're kind of gotten up.

325
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,548
Well, I just got a little date for supper.

326
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,437
Oh.

327
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,957
Well, I was kind of hoping we'd go to Tony's
and have spaghetti together.

328
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:25,194
But white tie, top hat-kind of looks
like you've changed your appetite.

329
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,796
Now, look, you know how I feel about society.
I can take it or leave it.

330
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,553
Well, good night.

331
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,712
Don't forget to use the right fork.

332
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,553
Right, and I won't shake hands
with the head waiter.

333
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,154
See you tomorrow.

334
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,996
- Good night, Frank.
- Good night, Gary.

335

- Whose car is that?
- Mimi.

336
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,671
Mimi Caraway's car.

337
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,278
Looks like Gary's stepping out
in society tonight.

338
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,674
About last night. I'm sorry.

339
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,275
- Forget it. About that sketch in our show...
- Forget it.

340
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,998
All right.

341
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,072
Shall we forget everything
and make a fresh start?

342
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,517
- As if we'd never met before.
- A couple of strangers alone in the big city.

343
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,750
You don't know me and I don't know you.

344
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,638
- We've never even heard of each other.
- Exactly.

345

<i>(</i>* <i>"He Ain't Got Rhythm")</i>

346
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:34,870
- I think we make a very handsome couple.
- I was just thinking that myself.

347
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,951
- I'm sorry.
- Hello, Mimi.

348
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,837
- Hello.
- Mimi, dear, how are you?

349
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,036
- When did you get back?
- About a week ago.

350
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,035
I called you up three times last week.
Oh, I want you to meet Mr...

351
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,839
- By the way, what is your name?
- Hasenpfeffer.

352
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,992
Oh, yes. Hasenpfeffer.
Mr Hasenpfeffer, Mr and Mrs Warren.

353
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,150
- How do you do?
- Awfully happy to know you.

354
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,470
- Thank you.
- I beg your pardon.

355
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,915
- Well, Gary. How have you been?
- Hello, Jack.

356
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,070
- Fine. Mary, how are you?
- Fine.

357
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,357
- May I present Miss... What is your name?
- Hasenpfeffer.

358
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,069
- Miss Hasenpfeffer, Mr and Mrs Jackson.
- How do you do?

359
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,390
She is of the old, old, old Hasenpfeffers.

360

- Oh, of Philadelphia?
- And Boston.

361
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,634
- Well, we'll see you later for a cup of tea?
- All right, Gary. Goodbye.

362
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,551
Let's go bowling.

- This is the joint. All right, Binns, open up.

365
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,710
Presto.

Careful.

Say what?

375
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,237
We got apple, peach, lemon...
How's about some soup, kids?

Coffee and 'nuts coming up.

- Ventilation.

395

Oh, the flies in here are terrible.

396
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:39,193
Pick out the ones you don't like, toots,

- All right, 25 cents.
- How much is that in francs?

- Roubles? That's Russian!
- Russian!

406
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,115
The Winter Palace, the Tsar,
the snow, the sleigh bells, the wolves.

407
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,478
- Oh, it takes me back to Moscow.
- Mishka, take me to Moscow with you.

408
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,915
Before you go, I want 25 cents.

409
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,275
You got a one-track mind. Give him 25 cents.

410
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,830
All right, all right. There you are. 25 cents.

411
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,470
I shot my last ten bucks at the shooting
gallery. You'll have to lend me some.

412
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,676
Help yourself.

413
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,473
Oh, we've only got 13 cents between us.

414
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,279
I don't know from nothing. I want 25 cents.

415
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,999
Now, look. You can trust me.
Haven't I an honest face?

416
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,629
I can't buy more doughnuts with your face.
I want 25 cents.

417
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,792
- Maybe we'll tell him who we are.
- I'm Gary Blake.

418
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,075
That's not my fault.

419
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,277
That's how famous you are.
I'll tell him who I am. Mimi Caraway.

That's fine. I'm Joe Papaloupas. So what?

- Hello.

- Gary, I want you to meet Mr Pap...
- Papaloupas.

423

- Hello. What is this? I gotta make more pies.

424
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,230
- What kind of pies?
- Apple, peach, coconut, custard...

425
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,189
- Let's go. This is where we came in.
- You don't go till I get 25 cents!

426
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,670
- He wants 25 cents.
- I want 25 cents.

427
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,152
Listen, Mr Papaloupas...
Or may I call you Joe?

428
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,515
You can call me anything for 25 cents.

429
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,672
- I've got a proposition to make.
- I got <i>pies</i> to make.

430
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,797
We owe you 25 cents, we haven't got 25 cents.

431
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,314
My hat's worth 25 dollars.
I'll give it to you.

432
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,029
I don't want any hats! I got a hat! Look!

433
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,714
Oh, but not like this one. Look.

434
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,910
- Try it on. Look.
- I don't like it!

435
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,070
I don't want to look. I don't want to look.

436
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,912
I...

437
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,753
It's not bad. How does she look in the back?

438
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,116
- Beautiful. Mrs Papaloupas would love it.
- You think so?

439
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,873
All right, it's a deal. I hope I don't got stuck.

440
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,475
- Goodbye, Mr Papaloupas.
- Bye, and remember me to Mrs Papaloupas.

441
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,269
- And the little Papaloupases.
- Hope they like the hat. Goodbye.

442
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,831
Pretty snappy guy, me.

443
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,872
- Look, a radio in here. Imagine that.
- Turn it on.

Ah, that's nice, huh?

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,515
- This old boy really has an eye for business.
- He certainly has.

447
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,275
- Having fun?
- I was just thinking how nice it's been.

448
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,194
Four hours of being Miss Hasenpfeffer
and Mr Hasenpfeffer.

449
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,317
- No one reminding you how rich you are.
- Nobody reminding...

450
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,994
Now, now, now. Let's not fight.

451
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,677
- Hey, Binns, where are we?
- Still in Central Park, sir.

452
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,275
You can stay in the cab
and listen to the music, sir.

453
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:11,718
Or you can go over to that second bench
on the left, sir. It's very popular.

454
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,349
They say there's a good view
of the moon from there, sir.

455
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,795
- Thanks for the tip, Binns.
- All right.

456
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,275
Miss Hasenpfeffer, I believe this is my dance.

457
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,351
Quite right, sir.

458
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,598
Well, here's the bench and there's the moon,
so this must be the place.

459
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,956
Even if it isn't,
it's nice being here with you alone.

460
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,828
Oh, Mr Hasenpfeffer,
you're not getting romantic, are you?

461
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,994
Why not?
* I love you, which is easy to see

462
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,396
* But I have to keep guessing
how you feel about me

463
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,956
* You listen to the words that I speak

464
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,793
* But I feel that you listen

465
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,428
* With your tongue in your cheek

466
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,239
* You're laughing at me

467
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:22,316
* I can't be sentimental
for you're laughing at me

468
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,595
* I know

469
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,192
* I want to be romantic

470
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,397
* But I haven't a chance

471
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,472
* You've got a sense of humour

472
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,918
* And humour is death to romance

473
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,073
* You're laughing at me

474
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,879
* Why do you think it's funny

475
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,956
* When I say that I love you so?

476
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,999
* You've got me worried and I'm all at sea

477
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:07,709
* For while I'm crying for you

478
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,793
* You're laughing at me

479
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:23,275
* I can't be sentimental
for you're laughing at me

480
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,749
* I know

481
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,471
* I want to be romantic

482
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,272
* But I haven't a chance

483
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,670
* You've got a sense of humour

484
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:43,039
* And humour is death to romance

485
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,476
* You're laughing at me

486
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,794
* Why do you think it's funny

487
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:55,876
* When I say that I love you so?

488
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,153
* You've got me worried and I'm all at sea

489
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,750
* For while I'm crying for you

490
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:14,953
* You're laughing at me

491
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,391
Come in.

492
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,910
Good morning, sir. We are home, I believe.

493
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,111
Thank you.

494
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,192
- What is this? The Grand Central Station?
- This is where I live.

495
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:59,358
Thank you for a delightful evening. You
and your horse have been swell company.

496
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,034
Thank you very, very much, sir.

497
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,998
- What's the bad news?
- Well, now, let me see, sir.

498
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,389
Two and two is four.

499
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,517
- Four and four is...
- Eight.

500
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,275
Thank you, sir. Oh, I'll leave it to you, sir.

501
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,397
- He's leaving it to you.
- He is. I know.

502
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,553
- Look, it's my turn now.
- No, no, no. It's still on me.

503
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,317
- Here you are, Binns. That's the best I can do.
- I couldn't take your overcoat.

504
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,551
- Oh, no, no. Keep it, keep it.
- Thank you, sir, very much.

505
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,916
- And here's a little tip for you.
- Thank you very, very much.

506
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,470
- Good morning, Binns.
- Good morning, sir.

507
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,596
- Must you go in?
- My dear, it's morning.

508
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,638
Do you realise we've been out all night?

509
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,359
At the North Pole,
the nights are six months long,

510
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,908
Let's not talk about the North Pole.

511
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,515
Oh, I get it. The explorer.

512
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,713
- Look, about that sketch...
- It doesn't matter now.

513
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,713
But it does. I'll do something about it.
I'll have them take it out of the show.

514
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,759
You know, I started out
this evening hating you.

515
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,833
And here I am ending up
liking you an awful lot.

516
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,635
Well, when two people
can laugh their way into love, they're lucky.

517
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,438
You know, back there in the park...

518
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,870
I wasn't kidding.

519
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,951
Nor was I.

520
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,190
These are also from Mr Blake, madam.

521
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,670
Aren't they lovely?
But where shall I put them?

522
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,957
- Oh, here, put them here.
- Yes, madam.

523
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,230
- Take these to the library.
- The library's already filled.

524
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,518
Well, then, put them by the window.
And be careful.

525
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,798
- Good morning, darling.
- Good morning, Aunt Fritz.

526
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,832
- Heavens, where did you get the flowers?
- Aunt Fritz, he's wonderful, he's divine.

527
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,150
- Who's wonderful? Who's divine?
- Gary Blake.

528
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,994
- What is he? A florist?
- No, darling. You'll adore him.

529
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,753
- <i>(phone rings)</i>
- That's him now!

530
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:30,038
- Hello, this is Mr Hasenpfeffer speaking.
- Hello, darling.

531
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,954
I have some bad news for you. They refused
to take that sketch out of the show.

532
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,314
Oh.

533
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,109
I had a row with the producer and told him
if it stayed as it was, I'd walk out.

534
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,910
Gary, you mustn't. I won't let you. The show's
a big success and it means a lot to you.

535
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,991
I know it does.

536
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,674
- I've done the next best thing.
- What's that?

537
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,797
I've been working on it
and I've changed it in such a way

538
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,440
I know it won't be offensive,
I promise you that.

539
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,479
Oh, that's nice of you. You're a darling.
Am I going to see you tonight?

540
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,437
Hmm. You won't be able to avoid me.

541
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,557
I have it. We'll all come
and see the show, the whole family.

542
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,792
You've got to meet Father sometime anyway.
You're going to love Aunt Fritz.

543
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,997
I'm a cinch if she's related to you.
What's she like?

544
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,914
Aunt Fritz? Oh, she's just a sweet old lady.

545
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,309
Lace cap, rocking chair, knitting.

546
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,914
Practically Whistler's Mother.

547
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,718
Fine talk!

548
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,316
- Supper afterwards, maybe?
- Supper afterwards, positively.

549
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,958
The only trouble about tonight
is it's too far off.

550
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,678
Goodbye, darling.

551
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,753
Aunt Fritz, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love.

552
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,676
* This year's crop of kisses

553
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:49,550
* Don't seem as sweet to me

554
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,716
* This year's crop just misses

555
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,590
* What kisses used to be

556
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,395
* This year's new romance

557
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,756
* Doesn't seem to have a chance

558
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:13,836
* Even helped by Mr Moon above

559
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,156
* This year's crop of kisses

560
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,993
* Is not for me

561
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:26,473
* For I'm still wearing last year's love

562
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,235
* This year's crop of kisses

563
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:37,314
* Don't seem as sweet to me

564
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,310
* This year's crop just misses

565
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,394
* What kisses used to be

566
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,191
* This year's new romance

567
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,431
* Doesn't seem to have a chance

568
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:01,117
* Even helped by Mr Moon above

569
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,749
* This year's crop of kisses

570
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,559
* Is not for me

571
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,031
* For I'm still wearing

572
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:17,716
* Last year's love

573
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,872
Oh, help yourself.
Want some potato chips? Want some?

574
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,589
I've been doing work on the Caraway sketch.
Rewrote it, part of it.

575
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,434
- Wasn't it good enough?
- No, it's just the hit of the show, that's all.

576
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,876
I know it's the hit of the show.
I think we can get the same results,

577
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,349
without making Miss Caraway look silly.

578
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,512
It's practically the same thing,
just toned down a little.

579
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:46,718
When you enter, I don't think it's necessary
to smoke with that long cigarette holder,

580
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,156
- Or wear all that phoney jewellery.
- That will improve it a lot.

581
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,518
Certainly it will. Here's the idea.
We make the same entrance without the dogs.

582
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,956
- It's not fair to mock anyone that loves dogs.
- You're right.

583
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,508
I'll play the old man with a little more dignity.

584
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,398
You play Mimi...
Well, make her a little more ladylike.

585
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,631
The idea is just not to make
Miss Caraway look ridiculous.

586
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,030
Of course not. We mustn't make
Miss Caraway look ridiculous.

587
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:14,955
Mr Blake, there's a lady
named Miss Mimi Caraway

588
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,793
wanna see you on the telephone, please.

589
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,871
OK, Step. Excuse me.

590
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,069
Miss Caraway, huh?

591
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:30,439
Well, if he thinks I'm gonna play stooge
to that human cash register, he's crazy.

592
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,911
<i>(</i>* <i>"Home Sweet Home")</i>

593
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,991
I understand the sketch has been rewritten.
There's nothing in it embarrassing to us.

594
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,197
That's right, darling. Gary gave me his word.

595
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,757
- John, that's you.
- Shh. Quiet.

596
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,589

597
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,672
Hello. Yes, Commodore.

00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,433
Your father calling, Miss Mimi.

599
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,759
- Yes, Papa dear.
- Oh, Mimi.

600
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,310
What is it you want, you old, fat walrus?

My dear, if we're going to the opera,
you'd better hurry.

604
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,478
Oh, but, Papa dear,
I don't want to go to the opera.

605
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:35,395
I'm going to stay home and give the pigs
a bath. And I want you and Auntie to help me.

- Call my car.
- Yes, sir, Mr Caraway.

612
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,395
Without a doubt, that is
the most disgraceful exhibition I've ever seen.

613
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,630
The sketch is even worse than it ever was.

614
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:25,590
I know it is, Father. I never thought
Gary would do a thing like that.

615
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,229
What are you laughing at?
What's so funny about it?

616
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,915
I haven't laughed this much
since the night you kicked the butler

617
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,991
and broke your big toe.

618
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,311
- Gary! Gary!
- What's up?

619
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,517
- Where's Gary? He's on next. Get him!
- Gary Blake!

- What's the matter?
- Find Gary, he's on next.

Mr Blake! Mr Blake!

- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, James.

- Rather chilly, sir.
- Chilly?

624
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,155
- Yes, sir. The snow is snowing.
- Really?

625
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,710
- The wind is blowing.
- Ah, but, James...

Aunt Fritz, what on earth are you doing?

678
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,674
After seeing myself in that sketch,
I'm off everything Russian.

679
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,196
I've taken up something new.
Mimi, this is Herr Hanfstangel,

680
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,396
of the Five Flying Hanfstangels.

681
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,472
- For 16 years with Ringling Brothers.
- How do you do?

682
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,869
The greatest aerial artist in America.

683
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,076
Oh, no. In the world.

684
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,833
- Aunt Fritz, may I speak to you alone?
- Of course.

00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,959
- Will you excuse us, Herr Professor?
- Certainly.

Mimi, you must have gotten up
before breakfast this morning. How come?

687
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,828
Aunt Fritz, I didn't sleep a wink last night.

688
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,195
Why didn't you take a sleeping powder?

689
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,113
I've never been so upset in all my life.

690
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,715
The more I think of what Gary Blake
did to me, the madder I get.

691
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,870
Gary telephoned me this morning.

692
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:05,191
- Telephoned you?
- Yes, he's on his way here now.

693
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,840
- What's he coming over here for?
- I don't know.

694
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,480
Perhaps he wants to talk about you.

695
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:14,951
- He's got a nerve, wanting to talk to you.
- Any message I can give him?

696
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,830
Yes. Tell him I think he's the lowest thing
I've ever had the misfortune to meet.

697
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,592
- Anything else?
- Yes.

698
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,229
If he thinks he made <i>me</i> look ridiculous,
wait till I finish with <i>him</i>.

699
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,709
There's no use crying over spilt gin.

700
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,598
- The damage is done. Forget it.
- I'll never forget it.

701
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,956
Now, see here, don't you do anything
that you'll be sorry for.

702
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,998
- Let's talk this over.
- I don't want talk! I want action.

703
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:41,596
- What can you do about it?
- Do about it? You'll see.

704
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,320
Mimi.

705
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,474
Mimi, let me explain.
I've tried to reach you.

00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,551
I'm not interested.

Come up here. I want to talk to you.

709
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,391
I'll be right up.

710

<i>(woman)</i> Hello. I'm sorry, but Mr Dibble
is in conference. Will you call later?

Hello, boys.

712
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,197
Well, this is a cheerful little gathering.

713
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,352
What's all the excitement about?

714
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,477
- Read that.
- Every paper in town carried that story.

715
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,235
After what happened last night,
the Caraways might make trouble.

716
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:45,279
Well, you're a lawyer, that's your racket.
What do you think?

717
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:49,399
Well, the first sketch was OK,
but after the way it was acted last night,

718
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:53,632
the Caraways can sue you for damages
and take your pants.

719
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,439
And winter coming on. Do you think so?

720
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:59,990
They've got a great case.
Of course, they may not want the publicity.

721
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,390
- Everybody wants publicity.
- All you can do is sit tight,

722
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,631
- And hope it'll blow over.
- Blow over? You mean blow up.

723
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,518
And blow me up with it. Just my luck.

724
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,955
Don't let it get to you.
Maybe they won't sue.

725
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:16,830
Say, when people are that rich,
they'll do anything for money.

726
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,754
- Psst, Mr Dibble.
- Well, what do you want? What? What?

727
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,831
Miss Caraway is here.

728
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,709
- Mimi Caraway?
- In person.

729
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,195
- What did I tell you?
- She's gonna sue you.

730
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,558
Don't get excited. Control yourselves.
Don't let your nerves run away with you.

731
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:39,838
For heaven's sake, there's no occasion
to be excited. As a favour to me, quiet.

732
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,911
Quiet, please.

733
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,834
And you too! Let me see.

734
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,357
Bless my sister's cat's suspenders. Now,
will you please be calm and don't get excited?

735
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,477
I'll handle the situation. Quiet, now, will you?

736
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,790
As a favour.

737
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,235
I know what I'll do.
I'll tell her I'm not in.

738
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,311
<i>(Mimi)</i> But you are in.

739
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,028
Mr Dibble, I want to talk to you.

740
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:10,477
- I think we can come to some arrangement.
- That's why I'm here.

741
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,755
- Miss Caraway.
- Sit down.

742
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,439
I...

743
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:22,869
Well, how have you been?
That's good. Huh? Oh.

744
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,795
Of course, Miss Caraway, I realise this
has been sort of a mistake and I apologise.

745
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:31,111
I don't want your apologies.
I want to buy your show.

746
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,794
Yeah... What?

747
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,474
The lady wants to buy your show.

748
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,630
She wants to buy the show.

749
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,553
Say, lady, are you kidding me?

750
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:47,191
I want to buy your show
and you're going to sell it.

751
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,271
She says I'm going to sell it.

752
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:53,911
I can't sell this show. It's a colossal success,
and I expect to make a fortune with it.

753
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,879
Now, look. I've been to see my lawyers
and I know exactly where I stand.

754
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,428
I can close your show
and put you out of business.

755
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,432
So let's stop beating around the bush.

756
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,353
Yes, I guess we'd better stop that.

757
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:10,956
Wouldn't you know it? First hit show I've had
in five years and now this has to happen.

758
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,871
How much?

759
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,150
How much? Well, let me see,
that would require a little figuring.

760
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:20,835
Now, let me see, there is first
the producer's salary. That's me.

761
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:26,836
The general cost of production. That'll run
into money. The scenery and the scenic artist.

762
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:30,595
Then there's the libretto
and the lyrics, the music.

763
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:34,912
Let's see, the costumes. That's the tights
for the girls and all stuff like that.

764
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,118
Spangles and so forth.
Let me see... There's the orchestra.

765
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:43,113
And the overhead out in front of the house
and the stage hands.

766
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,795
And, let me see, what else is there?
There must be something else.

767
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,678
Oh. Oh, yes. The actors' salaries.

768
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,234
- Mr Dibble, here's your cheque.
- Thanks. Kelly, look. Get away.

769
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:59,155
Now, I don't want anyone to know that I've
bought this show until after tomorrow night.

770
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,595
If news gets out, the deal is off. Understand?

771
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:06,515
Absolutely. A deal's a deal. Good luck.
Come on, Kelly, slide.

772
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,239
- From now on, you are working for me.
- Yes, ma'am.

773
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,311
Get me Walter Winchell.

774
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,995
And you, Eddie, I want you to get me
400 extra people for tonight.

775
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,629
Scatter them around the theatre.
I'll give them instructions later.

776
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:24,829
I want you to see that whatever disturbance
happens in the theatre, the ushers do nothing.

777
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:30,597
- Listen, Miss Caraway, what is this mystery?
- If I told you, there'd be no mystery.

778
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,796
Hello? Mr Winchell?

779
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:37,112
I've got a tip for you. Be sure that
you're at Gary Blake's show tonight.

780
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,475
Something very exciting's going to happen.

781
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:45,192
What? Never mind who I am, but if you want
a great story for your paper, be there.

782
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,236
Goodbye.

783
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:51,996
Eddie, I want you to get hold of all the other
columnists and make sure they come tonight.

784
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,071
Yes, ma'am.

785
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,119
- Did you send for the Ritz Brothers?
- Yes.

786
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,668
- They're here.
- <i>(they argue)</i>

787
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:15,111
Wait a minute. I'm sure that's all very
interesting, but I'm afraid my time is limited.

788
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,556
- Well, how do you do?
- I understand you are supposed to be funny.

789
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,949
Why, do you wanna
make something out of it?

790
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,032
I'm going to give you a chance
to be really funny.

791
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:27,112
- Here's what I want you to do.
- What?

792
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:39,437
* Put on your slumming clothes
and get your car

793

where the high-toned people are

794

* Come on, there's lots of fun in store for you

795
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,352

and wine for a beautiful lady.

906
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:56,393
None of that red ink
you've been serving round here.

907
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,914
Champagne, Luigi. I'm celebrating tonight.

908
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,754
You're gonna have a bottle of the finest
champagne I got in the house.

909
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:06,833
- The finest will be none too good.
- Yes, Mr Blake.

910
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,793
I knew I'd find you here.

911
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,713
We haven't been here
for a long time, have we?

912
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,552
Nope.

913
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:26,309
Well, I don't mind saying I'm glad to see you.

914
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:30,476
I'm glad you're glad.

915
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,791
Well, it's a small world, I always say.

916
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:36,030
What do you always say?

917
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:39,271
I always say, "Where's that champagne?"

918
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,999
Right. Luigi, where's that champagne?

919
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,071
Coming, Mr Blake.

920
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:51,155
<i>(</i>* <i>"Let's Go Slumming On Park Avenue")</i>

921
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,799
* Let's go slumming, nose-thumbing

922
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,474
* At Park Avenue

923
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:22,514
Funny thing about that song. That's just what
I've been doing-slumming on Park Avenue.

924
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:26,070
Anyway, it didn't work.
I guess I was on the wrong street.

925
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,754
Sure.

926
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:33,598
A boy from across the tracks
is taken for a ride.

927
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,437
At least I don't have to see
that lady any more. And am I glad.

928
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,511
Here's to you, honey.

929
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:48,195
You know, I never did think
you were a good actor. Now I know it.

930
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:52,317
- What?
- Oh, nothing. Just thinking out loud.

931
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,994
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

932
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:31,031
- Marie. Get me a drink.
- It's almost time for the ceremony to start.

933
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:35,352
- Get me a drink, and I don't mean a little one!
- Yes, Miss.

934
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:39,752
It's no use, Miss. Just a moment, please.
I tell you Miss Caraway can't see anyone.

935
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,831
Well, she'll see me!

936
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:45,558
Come back here!
You can't go in there.

937
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:48,830
- You can't come in here.
- Well, I'm in.

938
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,911
I'm sorry, but I must ask you to leave.

939
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,073
I'm not leaving here
till I speak to Miss Caraway.

940
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,399
Well?

941
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:00,916
I tried to reach you by telephone,
but you refused to talk to me.

942
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,958
- So I thought I'd use this method.
- Go on.

943
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:09,273
I just want to talk to you for one minute -
and it's a very important minute for you.

944
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,954
Very well.

945
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,713
- Alone.
- Wait outside, please.

946
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,839
This is the nearest I'll get
to smelling orange blossom.

947
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:22,469
- What do you want?
- All right. I won't take up much of your time.

948
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:26,075
I didn't come here because I wanted to
or because I'm crazy about you.

949
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,230
I came to square something for Gary Blake.

950
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,788
I'm not interested
in anything concerning him.

951
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,553
Say, that don't make me mad.
I hope you're not.

952
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:36,677
But I want you to know
it wasn't his fault about the sketch.

953
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:40,150
- He didn't do it. I did.
- What do you mean?

954
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:46,074
Well, Gary changed the sketch to take the
sting out of it and make it all pretty for you.

955
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:49,675
I put in those cracks.
He didn't know about it until he heard them.

956
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,399
Why did you do a thing like that?

957
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,836
Why do women do
any of the crazy things they do?

958
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:00,596
I liked him and I thought he liked you,
so I tried to break it up.

959
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,671
Then it was a terrible thing
that I did to him, wasn't it?

960
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:07,069
Well, I wouldn't call it sweet.

961
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,799
I wonder... Where is he now?

962
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:14,556
He just left his hotel with a taxi full of
luggage. Nobody knew where he was going.

963
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,631
Then I guess it's too late.

964
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:20,918
Well, I just wanted you to know
that it wasn't his fault.

965
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:29,597
- You had courage to come and tell me this.
- More courage than sense. Good luck.

966
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:31,671
Thank you.

967
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:37,470
Marie. Marie!

968
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,516
- Yes, Miss.
- Where's Aunt Fritz?

969
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,591
She called and said she wouldn't be here.

970
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:44,990
- Wouldn't be here?
- I didn't quite understand it myself.

971
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:49,915
She said she knew you'd have a headache,
and one headache at a wedding was enough.

972
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,991
That's all.

973
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:57,512
- Fred, aren't you a little bit nervous?
- No. I've had a certain amount of experience.

974
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,830
Will you really honeymoon at the North Pole?

975
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,071
Why not? I only wish we might
have held the marriage there too.

976
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:09,235
- I would have liked you boys to have seen it.
- Mr Sims, the ceremony is about to start.

977
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:11,709
Well, here we go, gentlemen.

978
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,268
<i>(</i>* <i>"Bridal Chorus" by Wagner)</i>

Get down! Down, I tell you! Get down!

988
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:18,355
Quick, there's a taxi waiting. Now, get in it.

989
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:26,470
The city hall, and don't spare the horses!

990
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:36,799
Get down, I said!

991
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:39,633
Who locked me in that room
with that pack of wolves?

992
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,711
Get down! Get down!

993
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:46,991
- Where's Mimi?
- I don't know, but your tie's crooked.

994
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,196
Father, why are we going to the city hall?

995
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:54,831
To get a marriage licence,
so you can become Mrs Hasenpfeffer.

996
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:57,388
Why, Mr Hasenpfeffer!

997
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:01,439
Darling, I think coffee and doughnuts
would make a lovely wedding breakfast.

998
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,639
Special for today,
we have pig's foot and sauerkraut.

999
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:09,555
For soup, we got vegetable soup, creamed
tomato, asparagus, split pea and oxtail.

1000
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:14,953
For pies, we got strawberry, apricots,
coconut, gooseberries, banana cream,

1001
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:18,874
- Or lemon meringue.
- What? No pumpkin?!

1002
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,110
- No punk.
- No punk?

1003
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,430
- No punk.
- No punk.

1004
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:27,437
- All right, make it coffee and doughnuts.
- For two.

1005
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:30,353
Two coffees, two 'nuts, coming up.
