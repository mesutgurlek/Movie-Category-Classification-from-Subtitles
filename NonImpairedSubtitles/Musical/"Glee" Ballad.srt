1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:03,262
<i>Here's what you missed last week.</i>

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:06,430
<i>Quinn's pregnant and Puck's the father,
but everybody thinks it's Finn.</i>

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,031
You're a punk who doesn't
deserve Quinn as his girlfriend!

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,078
<i>Except for Quinn's parents
who don't know anything at all.</i>

5
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,806
<i>They just know she's in the Celibacy Club.</i>

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,872
Well, call the Vatican. We got ourselves
another immaculate conception.

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,316
<i>- And that's what you missed on...
- ¶¶ Glee ¶¶</i>

8
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:28,052
Ballad. From Middle English "balade."

9
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,723
- Who knows what this word means?
- It's a male duck.

10
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,496
- Kurt.
- A ballad is a love song.

11
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:39,402
Sometimes, but they don't always express love.

12
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:41,406
Ballads are stories set to music...

13
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:44,443
<i>which is why they're the perfect storm
of self-expression.</i>

14
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:48,914
Stories and music are the way we express
feelings that we can't get out any other way.

15
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,610
<i>Okay, now sectionals are in a few weeks.</i>

16
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:55,279
And there's a new rule this year.
We have to perform... a ballad.

17
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:59,985
Looks like my weekly letter to the Ohio
Show Choir Committee finally paid off.

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,119
Okay, so here's our assignment for the week.

19
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,995
I'm gonna pair you off, and I want you
to pick a ballad to sing to your partner.

20
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,261
Look them right in the eye...

21
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:11,599
find the emotion you want to express,
and make them feel it.

22
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:15,266
- I pick Quinn.
- No, no, no, no, no. Too easy.

23
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,639
Your partners will be chosen by fate.

24
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,941
- Oooh.
- "Oooh," yeah. I put all your names in this hat.

25
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,039
Whoever you choose is your partner.

26
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,381
<i>- I bet that duck's in the hat.
- But Matt's out sick today.</i>

27
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,786
He had to go to the hospital
'cause they found a spider in his ear.

28
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,314
I guess I'll just have to put
my name in the hat for now.

29
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,953
<i>Who's up first?</i>

30
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,991
<i>- Mercedes.
- All right.</i>

31
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,666
Quinn.

32
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,871
Kurt.

33
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,003
Mr. Schue, I don't know
if I can do this with another guy.

34
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,240
The Fates have spoken, Finn.

35
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,010
Other Asian.

36
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,848
Brittany.

37
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,686
<i>- How fitting.
- Yea!</i>

38
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,692
Looks like I get you, Mr. Schue.

39
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,721
Uh, you know what? Maybe we should
just wait until Matt gets back.

40
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,200
The Fates talked, Mr. Schue.

41
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,931
Would you mind clarifying
what kinds of songs you want us to sing?

42
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:22,406
Why don't you let
Mr. Schuester and I demonstrate?

43
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,410
Brad, "Endless Love" in B-flat, please.
It's my favorite duet.

44
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,504
I really don't think
that's an appropriate song, Rachel.

45
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,414
Why? It's a great song
and it's a perfect ballad.

46
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:35,386
Yeah, I really like that song, Mr. Schue.

47
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:45,397
¶¶ My love ¶¶

48
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,025
I could totally sing this song with Finn.

49
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,797
<i>But screw him if he thinks he's taking
the Diana Ross part from me.</i>

50
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,863
¶¶ The only thing that's right ¶¶

51
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,102
I love the days when I don't wear underwear.

52
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,236
<i>- Full commando.
- ¶¶ My first love ¶¶</i>

53
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,610
I never noticed how nice Rachel's butt is.

54
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,945
Oh, crap. I think Quinn
knows I'm staring at it.

55
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,451
¶¶ You're every breath that I take ¶¶

56
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:12,480
¶¶ You're every step I make ¶¶

57
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,584
¶¶ And I ¶¶

58
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,595
¶¶ l-l-I ¶¶

59
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,791
¶¶ I want to share ¶¶

60
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,324
¶¶ All my love ¶¶

61
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,395
¶¶ With you ¶¶

62
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:32,240
¶¶ No one else will do ¶¶

63
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:36,646
- ¶¶ And your eyes ¶¶
- ¶¶ Your eyes, your eyes ¶¶

64
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:42,951
¶¶ They tell me how much you care ¶¶

65
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,286
¶¶ Oh, yeah ¶¶

66
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,327
Wow. I've never noticed this before...

67
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,385
because he's always trying
to destroy my career...

68
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,431
but Mr. Schue has really pretty eyes.

69
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,763
¶¶ My endless love ¶¶

70
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:59,032
And really nice teeth. He's obviously
invested in good oral hygiene.

71
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:02,165
And that's important to me.
It shows wonderful self-esteem.

72
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,109
¶¶ I'll be that fool ¶¶

73
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,238
¶¶ For you ¶¶

74
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:11,374
¶¶ I'm sure ¶¶

75
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,045
I don't like the way she's looking at me.

76
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,955
<i>Oh, I shouldn't have sung this song to her.
Crap! She looks crazy right now.</i>

77
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,549
I know this look.

78
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,255
¶¶ And yes ¶¶

79
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:28,460
¶¶ You'll be the only one ¶¶

80
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,627
- ¶¶ Oh ¶¶
- ¶¶ 'Cause no ¶¶

81
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:33,729
¶¶ No one can deny ¶¶

82
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,138
¶¶ This love ¶¶

83
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,178
¶¶ I have inside ¶¶

84
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,236
¶¶ And I'll give ¶¶

85
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:44,374
¶¶ It all to you ¶¶

86
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,147
- ¶¶ My love ¶¶
- ¶¶ My love, my love ¶¶

87
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:53,818
¶¶ My endless love ¶¶¶¶

88
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,588
Okay, this is amazing.

89
00:04:55,662 --> 00:05:00,099
When I'm singing with him, it's like
I'm seeing him for the first time.

90
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:04,660
And what I'm seeing is super, super cute.

91
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,575
Okay. Something like that.

92
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:23,114
Sweetie, I am so proud of you.

93
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:28,559
The Chastity Ball is
so important to your father.

94
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:32,120
God, I miss the firm support
of my polyester Cheerios uniform.

95
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,723
The control panel hid my baby bump perfectly.

96
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:39,135
Hmm. That's odd. We had this
custom-made a month ago.

97
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,571
I had a really big lunch today at school.

98
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,632
Really big tacos.

99
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:51,108
No worries, sweetie.
I'll just take it down to the tailor tomorrow.

100
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,881
We'll let it out a little bit.
The problem here, honey, is, you know...

101
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:58,048
I just don't think you've been getting enough
exercise ever since you quit the Cheerios.

102
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,251
- Am I right?
- Yeah, yeah. That's right.

103
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:04,023
You used to spend hours every day
doing back flips and high kicks.

104
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,998
And now... I mean, now you spend
all your free time...

105
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,967
sitting on a stool in the dark
singing show tunes.

106
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,164
Do you know how many calories
you burn singing? Hmm?

107
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:16,572
<i>- Not very many.
- Judy! Glenn Beck is on.</i>

108
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,736
Oh, wait. Hold on.

109
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:22,747
<i>- He's so...
- Hold on. No, I don't want to see.</i>

110
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,749
Daddy, it's not like we're getting married.

111
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:28,253
I don't want... Oh.

112
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,256
<i>Oh! Look at you.</i>

113
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,383
Speaking of getting married...

114
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,917
how's that boy you've been dating?

115
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,362
Yeah, yeah. He's not pressuring
you at all, is he?

116
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:42,367
No. No, he's a gentleman.

117
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:46,371
I'm glad to hear that. That's why
I'm inviting him over for dinner on Sunday.

118
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,805
<i>- Oh, wonderful!
- Refresher?</i>

119
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,776
Honey, I don't want you
to lift a finger for me.

120
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:54,813
I'm your wife.

121
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,873
My little lemon drop. I gotta go catch Glenn.

122
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,622
- Mr. Schuester?
- Yeah?

123
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:11,060
I just wanted to confirm we're set to rehearse
our ballad at 4:00 sharp this afternoon.

124
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,031
Oh. Isn't Matt back yet?

125
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,968
No, it's just... you and me all week long.

126
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:23,102
Great. I'll see you at 4:00.

127
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,646
Is there something else?

128
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,807
I just wanted to give you this.

129
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,244
Open it.

130
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,253
Gold stars are kind of my signature thing.

131
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:45,957
I figure every time you wear it you can think
of me and the star you're helping me become.

132
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,534
<i>It's happening... again.</i>

133
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,936
It always starts with a novelty gift.

134
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,099
Well, you can't blame her, Will.

135
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,302
If we were gonna rank
crush-worthy teachers at this school...

136
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:01,039
you'd be number one with a bullet.

137
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:07,241
Uh, well, l-l... When did...
When did this start with Rachel?

138
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,551
We sang a duet in Glee Club. "Endless Love."

139
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:15,424
- Okay. In hindsight, that was probably a mistake.
- Yeah.

140
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,622
I can't handle going through this again.

141
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,257
Sorry. Going through, um...
Going through what again?

142
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:25,032
Have I ever told you about... Suzy Pepper?

143
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,409
The alpacas start there
and travel down towards Guadalajara.

144
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:35,243
<i>Suzy Pepper wasn't the first schoolgirl crush,
but she was the hardest.</i>

145
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,249
<i>It happened about two years ago
before you were a teacher here.</i>

146
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:41,514
<i>- Suzy was unique.
- Mr. Schue?</i>

147
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:45,421
How do you conjugate the verb "to love"?

148
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,561
Peppers.

149
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:02,335
So you can wear them and think of me...
Suzy Pepper.

150
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:06,003
<i>I thought it would burn out like
the others. But it only got worse.</i>

151
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,206
Hello?

152
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,583
Who is it? Who died?

153
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,554
Suzy Pepper?

154
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,614
You knew it was me
just by the sound of my breath.

155
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,320
That's so romantic.

156
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,556
Listen, you little psycho.
This is Will's wife.

157
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,928
And if I don't get enough sleep,
my antidepressants won't work.

158
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,331
- And then I'll go crazy, and I'll kill you.
- Terri.

159
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,370
Stop calling!

160
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:35,430
Can't you handle anything, Will?

161
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,442
<i>Terri was right.</i>

162
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,944
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

163
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:43,709
<i>I decided to be honest with Suzy.
Face this head-on.</i>

164
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,343
Okay, how'd that go?

165
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,760
<i>¶¶ More than words ¶¶</i>

166
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,859
¶¶ Is all you have to do ¶¶

167
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,837
¶¶ To make it real ¶¶

168
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,874
¶¶ That you love ¶¶¶¶

169
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,408
It was the world's hottest pepper.

170
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,546
- She had it shipped from Sinaloa, Mexico.
- Oh, gosh. What happened?

171
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,150
The ambulance arrived just in time.
The pepper burned holes in her esophagus...

172
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:30,059
and she was in a medically
induced coma for three days.

173
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,825
That's why I can't
just tell Rachel to back off.

174
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,832
These girls are too fragile.

175
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,868
Wow. Okay.

176
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,564
How 'bout this?
Why don't you take your own advice?

177
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,573
Right? Do what you told the kids to do.

178
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,371
If you're feeling awkward
telling Rachel how you feel...

179
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:47,412
then why don't you, um,
you know, sing it to her.

180
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,040
Let her down gently.

181
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,676
And don't wear that tie.

182
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,276
Yeah.

183
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,251
Sing to me everything you feel.

184
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,861
Okay. Uh...

185
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,525
I can't. I can't... I can't sing to a dude.

186
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,763
- You have to try.
- I can't! Okay?

187
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:16,331
I can't! I'm sick and tired of people pushing
me to be somebody I'm not.

188
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:23,479
Your lashing out at me
is fantastically compelling and inappropriate.

189
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,518
Dude, I'm sorry.

190
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:29,281
You're really awesome, Kurt. I...

191
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,414
I'm just under a load of crap right now.

192
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,583
Girls.

193
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,287
They're your problem.

194
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,763
They're up. They're down. Girls.

195
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,637
It's the baby.

196
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,606
She's my daughter and...

197
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:59,009
There are so many things I want to say to her,
and I'm never gonna be able to.

198
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,516
Like what?

199
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,250
Well...

200
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:09,658
like how I don't want her to
think that her father just abandoned her.

201
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,663
How I would do anything for her.

202
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:16,361
How no matter what I do
I'm always thinking about her.

203
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:20,701
How I'm gonna spend my whole life loving her
and she's never even gonna know.

204
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,642
You gotta let it out.

205
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,447
How?

206
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:34,384
By singing.

207
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:37,183
"I'll Stand By You," by the Pretenders.

208
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:41,158
It's in your wheelhouse. And I know you know
it from the radio because it's a classic.

209
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:44,993
And you do well with classics,
especially in the soft rock mode.

210
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:48,591
Yeah, I do like that song, but...

211
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,295
how's it gonna make me feel better again?

212
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,533
By singing it out to the audience.

213
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,040
Imagine your little girl sitting there.

214
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,247
Thank God I never missed a piano lesson.

215
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,088
¶¶ Oh ¶¶

216
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:21,600
¶¶ Why you look so sad ¶¶

217
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:25,125
¶¶ Tears are in your eyes ¶¶

218
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:29,504

219
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:33,033
¶¶ When the night falls on you ¶¶

220
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,945

221
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:39,178

222
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,277

00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,846
¶¶ I'll stand by you ¶¶

224
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,417
¶¶ I'll stand by you ¶¶

225
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:53,261
¶¶ Won't let nobody hurt you ¶¶

226
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,824
¶¶ I'll stand by you ¶¶

227
00:13:56,902 --> 00:14:00,463
¶¶ Take me in into
your darkest hour ¶¶

228
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,565
¶¶ And I'll never desert you ¶¶

229
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:07,476
¶¶ I'll stand by you ¶¶

230
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:11,107
¶¶ I'll stand by you ¶¶

231
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,710
¶¶ Won't let nobody hurt you ¶¶

232
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:20,054
¶¶ I'll stand by you ¶¶¶¶

233
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,116
Finn, what's going on?

234
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,131
- What are you doing?
- Uh, nothing.

235
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,168
Were you just singing to a sonogram?

236
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,678
Uh-huh.

237
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,420
Is Quinn pregnant?

238
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,026
Mom. I'm sorry.

239
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,866
- I'm so sorry!
- Shh, shh.

240
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:09,032
- I screwed up, Mom.
- It's gonna be okay.

241
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,002
- I'm so sorry.
- Shh, shh. Shh.

242
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,440
I can't believe you told your mom.
What if she tells my mom?

243
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:22,954
- She's not.
- Half the school knows.
Your mom knows. Who else you wanna tell?

244
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:26,116
- She's not gonna tell anybody.
- You're wrong. I'm right. I'm smart. You're dumb.

245
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,456
All this baby drama is making
my rosacea act up.

246
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:33,055
I know. I just feel bad for them,
having to go through this on their own.

247
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,498
Let me see what I can do.
I'll report back later.

248
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,694
<i>No, no, no. You're wrong. I'm right. I'm right.</i>

249
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,672
- She doesn't talk to other moms.
- Okay?

250
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,040
How do you explain
her constant irritation with you?

251
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,409
It's because she's a girl.

252
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,473
No, I think it's the pregnancy hormones
or something. They make her kinda nuts.

253
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,520
It's enough to wanna give up women altogether.

254
00:15:55,587 --> 00:16:00,081
Yeah. Anyway, thanks for the advice
about singing to the baby like that.

255
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,822
It worked like a charm. I owe you one, dude.

256
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:10,099
Okay, I'll admit it.
I'm madly in love with Finn.

257
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,228
I have been since the first time we met.

258
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,272
Dude, impulse control.

259
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,336
<i>He was my knight in shining armor.</i>

260
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:24,507
<i>My feelings only grew stronger
as we bonded over Glee...</i>

261
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,517
<i>then football, then skin care.</i>

262
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:30,021
Your "T" zone is dangerously dry.

263
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,250
Your "T" zone.

264
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,690
Oh.

265
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,753
Twice a day. It's very mild
and has a built-in sunblock.

266
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,891
Cool. Thanks, man.

267
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,834
I don't know why I find
his stupidity charming.

268
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:48,270
I mean, he's cheating off a girl who thinks
the square root of four is rainbows.

269
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,968
I guess that's love for you.

270
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,307
Hey, eyes on your own paper.

271
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,906
<i>I know it seems weird
that I'm helping Finn with Quinn.</i>

272
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,883
But rest assured,
it's all part of a master plan.

273
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,477
No matter what I do or how much
I assist him with his ballad...

274
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,579
<i>she's going to end up disappointing him
and breaking his heart.</i>

275
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:07,523
<i>And then he'll be crying
into my shoulder pads.</i>

276
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,424
Okay, so, I'm really excited.

277
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,595
I picked a medley of songs that's gonna be
a fantastic teaching tool...

278
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,228
<i>about how to sing a great ballad.</i>

279
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,138
- Why is Miss Pillsbury here?
- Uh...

280
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:27,110
Well, I... I, too, am very curious
about the power of the ballad.

281
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,171
You know, I'm thinking of doing
some career counseling in song.

282
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,614
- Emma.
- S.A.T. prep...

283
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,174
- Just... Yeah.
- Sitting. Yeah.

284
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:38,849
Okay, Rachel. This is a mash-up of"Young Girl"
by Gary Puckett & the Union Gap...

285
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,518
and the 1980 Police classic,
"Don't Stand So Close To Me."

286
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,720
And I want you to listen
very closely to the lyrics...

287
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,855
because I really mean what I'm singing.

288
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,791
Really... listen.

289
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,465
Okay.

¶¶ So bad it makes him cry ¶¶

306
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:07,069
¶¶ Beneath your perfume and makeup ¶¶

307
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:16,111
¶¶ You're just a baby in disguise ¶¶

308
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,622
¶¶ Get out of here ¶¶

309
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,093
¶¶ Before you have the time
to change your mind ¶¶

310
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:29,397
¶¶ 'Cause I'm afraid you'll go too far ¶¶

311
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:32,869
¶¶ Don't stand, don't stand so ¶¶

312
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:36,237
<i>¶¶ Don't stand so close to me ¶¶</i>

313
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:39,869
¶¶ Young girl, you're outta your mind ¶¶

314
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,470
¶¶ Your love for me
is way out of line ¶¶

315
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:47,611
<i>- ¶¶ Better run, girl ¶¶
- ¶¶ Don't stand so ¶¶</i>

316
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:54,786
¶¶ You're much too young, girl ¶¶¶¶

317
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,499
So, Rachel...

318
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,663
do you think you understood the message
I was trying to get across with that ballad?

319
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:10,936
Yes. It means I'm very young
and it's hard for you to stand close to me.

320
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,443
Oh, no. Um...

321
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:17,346
Emma, would you mind helping me out here?
Was that the message that you got?

322
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,681
You're a very good performer.

323
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:24,085
- He's very good.
- Well, I, for one, can't wait to go home...

324
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,090
and work on a medley
of my own for tomorrow.

325
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,753
Because this lesson has given me...
a lot to think about.

326
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:33,025
No, Rachel, that really wasn't the... You...

327
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,965
Bravo.

328
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,874
Thanks for coming over, Kurt.

329
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,415
I know you're into fashion
and that kind of stuff.

330
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:54,975
And I need to find something nice to wear
to the Fabrays for dinner. So...

331
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:58,147
I couldn't be more pleased and honored
to help you find something vintage...

332
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:01,215
and appropriate to wear.

333
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:06,788
Here it is. My mom never had
the heart to throw this stuff out.

334
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:14,366
Here, hang on to that for the next time Puck
throws you in the Dumpster.

335
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,441
My dad's the same way.

336
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:21,878
My mom died 10 years ago and he still keeps
her toothbrush on the holder by their sink.

337
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:27,751
The broken dresser in their room
still smells like her perfume.

338
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,947
<i>I know it's stupid,
but sometimes I'll sneak in there...</i>

339
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,150
and open all the drawers...

340
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:37,855
and lie on the floor
and close my eyes and just smell her.

341
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,920
That's not stupid.

342
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,761
I guess in a way I'm lucky
I never knew him. You know?

343
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,574
Check this out.

344
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,009
Not half bad.

345
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,952
Your father had good taste.

346
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,015
I can't believe it fits.

347
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,129
Um, thanks.

348
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,772
My father was brave enough to fight
in some desert thousands of miles away...

349
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:33,181
and I can't even go over to Dudley Road
and tell the Fabrays the truth.

350
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:38,215
Your father didn't charge
into the breach empty-handed.

351
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,554
He had a weapon.

352
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,059
You think I should bring a gun?

353
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:47,559
No. I think you should
use your greatest weapon.

354
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:50,123
Your voice.

355
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,100
Hey, sweetie, I'm home.

356
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:06,440
Something smells good.

357
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:21,198
- Oh, thanks.
- You're welcome.

358
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:24,463
Casserole's almost ready.
Hope you like venison.

359
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,775
Why did you even let her in the house?

360
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,936
'Cause she said she was one
of your Glee kids.

361
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:37,140
It didn't take me five minutes
to realize she's in love with you.

362
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:40,048
She asked if she could see your baby pictures.

363
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,484
What? So, now you're making her
clean our bathroom?

364
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,455
Look, Will, I've been dealing
with these schoolgirl crushes for years.

365
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,822
So why shouldn't I get
a little something out of it?

366
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:52,296
- Do you have any more Ajax?
- In the linen closet, sweetie.

367
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,401
- This is immoral, Terri.
- No, honey. You know what's immoral?

368
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,404
Is me having to deal with the fact...

369
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,168
that my husband spends all day
with young girls who are perkier...

370
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,709
and younger than I am.

371
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:10,339
I have a rash on my belly from that
cocoa butter that your mother sent me.

372
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,576
Do you have any idea
how much it burns when I sweat?

373
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:15,245
I can't scrub the floors as hard as she can.

374
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,312
<i>Baby, if it's that bad, you have
to let me see it. It might be infected.</i>

375
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,791
What? So, now I'm gonna show you
the bleeding pustules on my skin?

376
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,421
Wow. Yeah. No, that's not gonna send you
into the loving arms of some teenage slut.

377
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,965
For the last time, I am not having an affair
with any of my students.

378
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,467
And you are not allowed
to turn one of them into your slave...

379
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,765
because you have this
irrational fear of me leaving you.

380
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:35,807
Well, why not, huh,
if it's win-win for everyone?

381
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:39,037
Look, she's a really good cook. Try it.

382
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,578
- Where you going?
- I'm taking Rachel home.

383
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,376
Can you ask her to dust the blinds
in the craft room first?

384
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:48,613
<i>- Mr. Schuester?
- Yes, Rachel.</i>

385
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,780
Why do I have to sit in the backseat?

386
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:54,883
Um, it's the law.
Children have to ride in the back.

387
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,894
Children under seven.

388
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,362
Well, I'm just concerned for your safety.

389
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,428
Really?

390
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:06,870
Um, no. Not really.

391
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:13,038
I think we should take advantage of this
golden alone time and practice our ballad.

392
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:16,342
That would be great,
but I don't have any music in the car.

393
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:18,575
It's okay. I made us a CD.

394
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,809
Oh.

395
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:26,554
¶¶ Ah, crush ¶¶

396
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,054
<i>¶¶ Ah ¶¶</i>

397
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:32,961
¶¶ I see ya blowin' me a kiss ¶¶

398
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,465
¶¶ It doesn't take a scientist ¶¶

399
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,469
¶¶ To understand
what's going on, baby ¶¶¶¶

400
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,233
I wasn't finished.

401
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:47,608
Yeah, well, the acoustics are horrible
in the car. Put your seat belt back on.

402
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,773
<i>So, how's it going with Puck?</i>

403
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,976
<i>- Are you guys still seeing each other?
- I broke things off.</i>

404
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:57,613
<i>He was too immature.
As are all the boys in high school.</i>

405
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:00,624
I need a man who can keep up with me
intellectually and creatively.

406
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:04,219
Well, that's a tough road
for most high-school boys.

407
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,795
That's why I have my sights set much higher.

408
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:22,646
Stay away from him.
You're gonna get hurt... bad.

409
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:26,514
- You can't threaten me, Pepper.
I'm not afraid of you.
- You should be.

410
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:34,015
Oh, you're on the second floor?
Oh, you're right above me.

411
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:37,550
Girl, you? I'm a hot, damn mess.

412
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:41,622
I found out today my hamster is pregnant
in biology class and I just started weeping.

413
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,992
No, no, I think that's a great idea.

414
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,870
- We're supposed to be rehearsing.
- I'm talking to Tina.

415
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,239
I'll hit you back. This is bad, dude.

416
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,676
All our ballads are terrible
'cause we're all so distracted.

417
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,214
We're all worried about Finn
and Quinn and "babygate."

418
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,978
We can't even sing about our emotions
'cause we're so worried about theirs.

419
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:03,487
- Who cares?
- Um, we all do.

420
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:07,491
So we decided we're all gonna sing them
a ballad to show that we got their backs.

421
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,551
Are you kidding me?
There's no way I'm singing to them.

422
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,189
It's not fair! Finn gets everything.

423
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:16,825
- He gets the sympathy. He gets the girl.
- What is your problem?

424
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,994
Finn's not the father!

425
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,163
I am.

426
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:25,404
What?

427
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:30,547
All right, look.

428
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:33,379
You need to get something
through your Mohawk real quick.

429
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:36,852
You're the baby's daddy.
It takes a hell of a lot more to be a father.

430
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:40,721
And that role's already been cast
because Quinn chose Finn.

431
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,726
And you need to accept that and move on.

432
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:47,595
'Cause you have no business messing up that
girl's life any more than you already have.

433
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:52,069
You need to back off.
You owe her at least that much.

434
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:04,506
Mmm. A lovely ham.

435
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,914
- Thank you.
- There is no beating Judy's ham.

436
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:09,249
I cure all my own meats.

437
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:19,061
- I'd like to propose a toast.
- Daddy, no.

438
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,998
Russell and his famous toasts.

439
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:26,595
The Fabrays are a tight-knit family.

440
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,572
I have been blessed with a loving wife...

441
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,439
<i>two remarkable daughters.</i>

442
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,741
My first married a wonderful Christian man.

443
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:38,009
Owns his own chain of U.P.S. stores.

444
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,779
My second daughter, little Quinny...

445
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:43,821
we're just so proud of her.

446
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:48,689
Captain of the Cheerios,
president of the Celibacy Club.

447
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,628
I got a little peak at the dress.
I'm certain she's a shoo-in for princess.

448
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:55,427
- She is.
- But tonight...

449
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,630
we are very glad to welcome
her young friend, quarterback no less...

450
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,172
I have to go to the bathroom.

451
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,141
Uh, too much pop.

452
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,872
Oh, wait. It's right through
the kitchen, sweetheart.

453
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,848
<i>He wears a helmet when he plays, right?</i>

454
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,886
He's just intimidated by you, Daddy.

455
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:26,396
Well, hello, Finn Hudson.

456
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:30,025
I'm at the Fabrays and I'm freaking out.
What does a heart attack feel like?

457
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,036
Settle down, cowboy. This is why we burnt
the disc and spent that time rehearsing.

458
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,868
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can.
Just remember the power of the ballad.

459
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,807
I have to go. They'll think I'm pooping.

460
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,249
Ha!

461
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:56,185
- That's my kitchen radio.
- Yeah, I need to borrow it.

462
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,422
Finn? What's this?

463
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:01,761
Well, we have this assignment
in Glee Club to sing a ballad.

464
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:05,701
<i>They're all about expressing the things
you can't find any other way to say.</i>

465
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,068
Oh, God. Finn, don't.

466
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:12,235
- Please, don't.
- No, I need to do this... for both of us.

467
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,582
¶¶ You're havin' my baby ¶¶

468
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:29,290
¶¶ What a lovely way of sayin'
how much you love me ¶¶

469
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:32,428
¶¶ You're havin' my baby ¶¶

470
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:36,223
<i>¶¶ What a lovely way of sayin' ¶¶</i>

471
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,428
¶¶ What you're thinkin' of me ¶¶

472
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,768
¶¶ I can see it ¶¶

473
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:46,400
¶¶ Your face is glowin' ¶¶

474
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:49,139
¶¶ I can see it in your eyes ¶¶

475
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,047
¶¶ I'm happy you know it ¶¶

476
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,277
¶¶ That you're havin' my baby ¶¶

477
00:30:55,954 --> 00:31:00,482
<i>¶¶ You're the woman I love
and I love what it's doin' to ya ¶¶</i>

478
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,758
¶¶ You're havin' my baby ¶¶

479
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:10,999
¶¶ You're a woman in love
and I love what's goin' through ya ¶¶

480
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:14,470
<i>¶¶ The need inside you ¶¶</i>

481
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,598
¶¶ I see it showin' ¶¶

482
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,007
¶¶ Whoa, the seed inside you, baby ¶¶

483
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:44,764
There must be some sort of mistake here.
Quinny, we raised you right.

484
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:48,431
You... You did. We didn't even have sex.

485
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:51,339
<i>I'm sorry. Can we just stop
with the lying, please?</i>

486
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,606
<i>- But I'm...
- When you were about five years old...</i>

487
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,705
I took you and your sister
down to an Indians game.

488
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,909
<i>All the other dads brought their sons.</i>

489
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,817
<i>But my two girls were enough for me.</i>

490
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:07,988
<i>- Daddy.
- Your sister made it through the whole game.</i>

491
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,960
But you fell asleep in my lap.

492
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,998
I kept hoping nothing exciting
would happen...

493
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:17,296
<i>'cause I didn't want the crowd
to get too loud...</i>

494
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,261
and wake you up.

495
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,935
Didn't matter.

496
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,382
You stayed asleep in my arms...

497
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,845
till the game ended.

498
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,388
Daddy, I'm so sorry.

499
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,191
You need to leave.

500
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:49,666
Wait. Please, Daddy, can we talk about this?

501
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,895
Finn is a good guy.

502
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,699
He loves me.

503
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,602
You too.

504
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:59,200
Get out of my house.

505
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,336
But you can't do that.
She didn't do anything wrong.

506
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:04,210
Please, Mrs. Fabray, do something.

507
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:07,843
<i>Don't bother, Finn.</i>

508
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,878
If she wanted to do something, she would
have when she found out that I was pregnant.

509
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,291
You knew?

510
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,455
I... No. She didn't tell me anything.

511
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:22,693
But you knew. And I needed you.

512
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:26,294
I needed my mom.
And you were so scared...

513
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,703
of what he would do...

514
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,901
if he found out that
you just pushed it aside...

515
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:36,470
like we do every bad feeling in this house.

516
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:39,380
If you don't talk about it, it doesn't exist.

517
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,475
Now do not turn this on us!

518
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:43,884
You are the disappointment here!

519
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,946
Why?

520
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:51,521
Because I'm not a little girl anymore?

521
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,464
Because I made a mistake?

522
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,659
Who are you?

523
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:00,293
I don't recognize you at all.

524
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,430
I'm your daughter...

525
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,509
who loves you.

526
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,272
<i>And I know this must be really hard for you.</i>

527
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:13,511
But I just need my daddy to hold me
and tell me that it's gonna be okay.

528
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,159
Please.

529
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:34,194
<i>Judy!</i>

530
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:46,383
Honey, how many times have I told you
you gotta turn these T-shirts right-side out...

531
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:50,888
Um, Mom, Quinn's parents threw her out.

532
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,858
Could she stay here for a couple of days?

533
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,491
Yeah, of course she can.

534
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,725
Honey, you can stay here
as long as you want.

535
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,700
Hey, Barbra Streisand.
We need to have a little talk.

536
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,710
I have nothing to say to you, Pepper.

537
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,871
If you continue to stalk me,
I'll press charges.

538
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,212
Everyone knows what you are.
You're the school crazy.

539
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,808
I was crazy... crazy in love.

540
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,650
There's nothing you can say that's gonna
change the way I feel about Mr. Schuester.

541
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:28,249
Ours is a love for the ages. Your threats
will just make our love grow stronger.

542
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:31,659
Let me tell you a few things I learned
from two years of intense psychotherapy...

543
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,993
and an esophagus transplant.

544
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:37,432
Lesson number one:
You and Schue, it won't work.

545
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:39,663
What do you mean?

546
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,433
We're not so different, you and me.

547
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,567
We're both mildly attractive
and extremely grating.

548
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,873
Love is hard for us.

549
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:49,879
We look for boys
we know we can never have.

550
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:53,747
Mr. Schue is a perfect target
for our self-esteem issues.

551
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,685
He can never reciprocate our feelings,
which only reinforces the conviction...

552
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:59,723
that we're not worthy of being loved.

553
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,521
Trust me. I'm a cautionary tale.

554
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,594
You need to find some self-respect, Rachel.

555
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:12,466
Get that mildly attractive groove back.

556
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,480
Mr. Schuester, I'm ready when you are.

557
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,387
The ballad I've selected has an important
message that I'm anxious for you to hear.

558
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:34,617
Rachel, I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to stop you.

559
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:40,161
The way you've been acting
is totally inappropriate.

560
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:43,325
I'm your teacher, Rachel. And I'm sorry,
but that's all I'm ever gonna be.

561
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,433
I know.

562
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,938
I... I brought these for you
as an apology.

563
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,105
And the song I was gonna sing was...

564
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,478
"Sorry Seems To Be
the Hardest Word" by Elton John...

565
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,949
'cause I know how much you love him.

566
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:04,020
I'm such an idiot.

567
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:07,751
<i>Mooning over you
and cleaning your apartment.</i>

568
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:11,352
Hey. It's okay.

569
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:22,136
I know it's not always easy for you, Rachel.

570
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,401
And I know that there
are some things about yourself...

571
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:27,171
that you think you'd like to change.

572
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,372
But you should know
that there's some boy out there...

573
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,881
who's gonna like you
for everything you are...

574
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:34,383
including those parts of you
that even you don't like.

575
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:37,353
Those are gonna be the things
he likes the most.

576
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,324
Thanks, Mr. Schue.

577
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:49,659
What do you say we ditch rehearsal today?

578
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:54,194
I've gotta be honest, Rachel. You've never
really needed much help with your ballads.

579
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,241
You've been knocking them
out of the park since day one.

580
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:03,669
- Do you like them?
- They're great.

581
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,811
So they just kicked her out?

582
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:13,482
Yeah. Gave her half an hour to pack.

583
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:16,253
Her father set the timer on the microwave.

584
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:20,559
I'm sorry.
I guess my plan kinda sucked.

585
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,328
No. Uh, this is good.

586
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:28,304
No more secrets. You know,
everything's out there, all the feelings. Uh...

587
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,906
And that's better. Right?

588
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,405
Yes. Better.

589
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,613
Good. Uh...

590
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,552
All right, well, let's work on your ballad.

591
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:47,580
Uh, you were really helpful when
I was trying to find mine. So, what is it?

592
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:53,387
"I Honestly Love You."

593
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,398
Uh, sounds awesome.

594
00:38:57,268 --> 00:39:00,101
I don't know the song, uh, or whatever.

595
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:04,198
But it sounds... positive and nice and stuff.

596
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:08,772
<i>Hey, you two.
We need to go to the choir room.</i>

597
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,473
Why?

598
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:13,574
Because there's something
we want to give you and Quinn.

599
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,918
<i>Open your eyes.
I didn't tell you to close your eyes.</i>

600
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:22,447
<i>- Is there a cake?
- No, there's no cake. Be quiet. Sit down.</i>

601
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:26,428
<i>- Hi, Quinn.
- Do you know what's going on?</i>

602
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:30,263
<i>Your fellow Glee Club members
wanna sing a song for you guys...</i>

603
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:32,894
to let you know how they feel about you.

604
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,063
Uh, what are you gonna sing?

605
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:38,108
