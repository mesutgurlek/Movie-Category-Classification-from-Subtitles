75
00:08:17,682 --> 00:08:18,910
Wow! Wow!

76
00:08:19,116 --> 00:08:21,175
Come on. Let's get the subway.

77
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:27,953
Pardon me, sir, but how do I get uptown?

78
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:30,391
Well, let's see. If you wanna go to...

79
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,399
And there you are.

80
00:08:39,303 --> 00:08:41,635
I beg your pardon.
Is this the uptown platform?

81
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:43,196
Now, it all depends.

82
00:08:48,546 --> 00:08:49,638
Get that?

83
00:08:49,714 --> 00:08:50,942
Yeah, thanks.

84

85
00:09:03,728 --> 00:09:04,888
Then what'd he say?

86
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:08,693
So I said, "Listen, Mr. Gadolphin,
I won't work overtime, no matter what...

87
00:09:08,766 --> 00:09:11,633
"...whether it's handling
the bookkeeping accounts or you."

What'd he say?

89
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,501
So I said, "Listen, Mr. Gadolphin,
you make just one more pass at me...

90
00:09:16,574 --> 00:09:20,408
"...and yours truly is passing right out
from the Grand Illusion Girdle Company."

91
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:22,946
- And what did he say?
- So I said...

92
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,545
Hey! One side, fellows.

93
00:09:29,553 --> 00:09:32,613
- Say, what're you doin'?
- Puttin' up a little artwork.

94
00:09:32,923 --> 00:09:35,517
There. Miss Turnstiles

"Meet lovely Ivy Smith."

96
00:09:37,528 --> 00:09:40,463
- Gee, a real New York glamour girl.
- A debutante, I'll bet.

97
00:09:40,531 --> 00:09:43,022
- She must be pretty important.
- I wouldn't say that.

98
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,125
Her picture's up all over the subway.

99
00:09:45,202 --> 00:09:48,729
Well, like it says, they pick
a new Miss Turnstiles every month.

100
00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:50,334

101

Who knows? Maybe I'll meet her.

There are over four million women
in New York City.

134

It'll take you a million years to find her.

You put the fare in the box for her.

Hey, you're... Aren't you Miss Turnstiles?

140
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:44,267
- How did you know?
- I saw your picture in the subway and...

Oh, that.

well enough to take it with you.

- Fine.

We're proud of our boys.

I'll have to run.

Thanks for posing with me.

Hey, wait!

150
00:15:12,363 --> 00:15:14,558
- We'll head her off at the next station.
- What?

151
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:15,620
In a cab.

152
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:17,860
Why do you always have to run after girls?

153
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:20,631
I'll tell you when your voice changes,
Junior.

00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,537
Hey, Oz, come on.

155
00:15:25,075 --> 00:15:26,064
Taxi. Taxi.

156
00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:29,340
Sorry. No more fares today.
I'm turning in the cab. It's overdue.

157
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:30,675
Please, mister.

158
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:33,512
Hey! He's a girl!

159
00:15:33,784 --> 00:15:36,150
What're you doing driving a cab?
The war's over.

160
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,916
I never give up anything I like. Get in.

161
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,726
- The subway station.
- It's right there. You too weak to walk it?

162
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:45,227
No, the next one, uptown.

163
00:15:45,295 --> 00:15:48,025
All right, but only if he gets up front.

164
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:50,794
All right, Chip. Get up there.

165
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:51,994
- Get in there.
- No.

166
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:53,832
Come on. Get going.

167
00:16:02,646 --> 00:16:04,876
- What's wrong with you?
- What's got into you?

168
00:16:04,948 --> 00:16:09,851
I met her. I ran right into her. You said
it couldn't happen and I ran into her.

169
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,787
What became of the line of jive
that "mows 'em down"?

170
00:16:12,856 --> 00:16:16,053
I didn't have a chance. Just watch me
when we catch up with her.

171
00:16:16,126 --> 00:16:17,684
Lady, faster, please.

172
00:16:17,761 --> 00:16:19,251
Yeah, come on, lady.

173
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:21,923
For you, anything. What's your name?

174
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:23,855
Chip.

175
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:26,802
Chip, huh? Bet you can't guess mine.

176
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,498
There are over two million
girl's names registered...

177
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:33,304
All right, you win. It's Esterhazy.
Brunhilde Esterhazy.

178
00:16:33,544 --> 00:16:34,738
Pleased to meet you.

179
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:36,973
- Why don't you come up to my place?
- What?

180
00:16:37,047 --> 00:16:39,572
Look, Chip, I've been waitin' for you
all my life.

181
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,244
I knew you the minute I saw you.
You're for me.

182
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:46,415
I like your face, it's open,
you know what I mean? Nothin' in it.

183
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,854
The kind of a face I could fall into.

184
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:51,818
- Kiss me.
- Please, Miss Esterhazy.

185
00:16:51,895 --> 00:16:55,661
Just call me Hildy. Why don't you ditch
these guys and come up to my place?

186
00:16:55,732 --> 00:16:58,633
Lady, I hardly know you.
I've only got one day in town.

187
00:16:58,702 --> 00:17:02,638
- I want to see all the famous landmarks.
- Stick with me, kid, I'll show you plenty.

188
00:17:02,706 --> 00:17:04,071
Hey, here it is.

189
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,306
Oh, yeah, Columbus Circle.

190
00:17:25,262 --> 00:17:29,756
- Hey, Esterhazy, what're you doin' here?
- Hello, Spud. What's on your tiny mind?

191
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,630
Don't sweet-talk me.
This cab is due back in the garage.

192
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:35,900
Bixby's waitin' to take it out.
Get in there or I'll report you.

193
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,133
Okay. Okay.

194
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:42,875
We must have just missed the train.

195
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:44,641
Taxi. Taxi. Taxi.

196
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:47,707
I'll bet we'll find dozens of glamour girls
at Grant's Tomb.

197
00:17:47,784 --> 00:17:49,251
- Sure.
- Taxi, anyone?

198
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,186
You don't wanna waste your whole day
lookin' for one girl.

199
00:17:52,256 --> 00:17:53,416
Taxi. Taxi.

200
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:56,058
And besides, Gabe,
you always got the picture.

201
00:17:56,126 --> 00:17:58,754
When we get aboard ship,
you can hang it up in a locker.

202
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,761
The picture! Look, fellows,
it's full of clues.

203
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:05,661
- If I follow them, I'm sure to find her.
- What?

204
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:09,331
She has to be at one of these places.
We can track her down easy.

205
00:18:09,406 --> 00:18:11,636
Gabe, what's happened to you?

206
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:15,578
I don't know. All I know is
I gotta find this girl.

207
00:18:15,913 --> 00:18:17,778
Get your red hot taxis here.

208
00:18:18,448 --> 00:18:21,110
Wait a minute, fellows.
I don't want to spoil your day.

209
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:23,709
- You guys go ahead.
- What's it say on the card?

210
00:18:23,787 --> 00:18:26,984
If we do this systematically,
we can find her in a couple of hours.

211
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:29,287
It says she's studying painting
in the museums...

212
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,348
Museums?

213
00:18:31,094 --> 00:18:32,584
Come on. Let's try it.

214
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:33,527
Well?

215
00:18:33,797 --> 00:18:35,025
Here I am.

216
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:38,564
- Where's the nearest museum?
- Museum of Anthropological History.

217
00:18:38,635 --> 00:18:40,125
Okay, let's go.

218
00:18:40,571 --> 00:18:42,505
Only if he gets up front.

219
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,030
What's the big idea?

220
00:18:47,077 --> 00:18:49,568
I knew you'd come back.
They all come back.

221
00:18:55,118 --> 00:18:56,449
How much do we owe you?

222
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,921
Never mind. Let's run it up a little.
I'm coming in with you.

223
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:06,457
This unique skeleton is the result
of 20 years unceasing labor.

224
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,656
This dinosaur roamed the earth
six million years ago.

225
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,200
Let us move on.

226
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,728
Excuse me.

227
00:19:26,183 --> 00:19:28,811
Don't be frightened, lady. They're all dead.

228
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,379
Hold it. It's fantastic. I've simply got
to get the two of you together.

229
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:36,258
Oh, my dear, you are priceless.

230
00:19:38,195 --> 00:19:40,663
Thank you. How about some cheesecake?

231
00:19:40,998 --> 00:19:43,831
What a lucky girl I am.
I've got to get your measurements.

232
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,528
I'm a Junior Miss, size 11,
very high-waisted.

233
00:19:47,371 --> 00:19:48,531
Gorgeous.

234
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:50,366
Now, it's my turn.

235
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,842
Stop! How dare you!

236
00:19:58,081 --> 00:19:59,742
I was only playin', lady.

237
00:20:00,717 --> 00:20:02,207
What are you doin' tonight?

238
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:07,018
Now, just a minute. I want you to know
that my interest in you is purely scientific.

239
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,955
I'm just a cold-blooded scientist...

240
00:20:09,026 --> 00:20:11,893
...and I'm writing an anthropological study
for this museum.

241
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:14,954
It's called <i>Modern Man - What Is It?</i>

242
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:18,127
- The name is Claire Huddesen.
- Pleased to meet you.

243
00:20:18,201 --> 00:20:20,931
I took your picture just now
because you look exactly...

244
00:20:21,004 --> 00:20:25,338
...like this <i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i>,
a man extinct since 6,000,000 B.C.

245
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:26,941
I look like that?

246
00:20:30,213 --> 00:20:31,578
I look like that.

247
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,811
Now, don't be moody.
You made an understandable mistake.

248
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:36,575
And now the head.

249
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,550
That subsuperdolichocephalic head!

250
00:20:39,923 --> 00:20:42,357
Sailor, I love you for having that.

251
00:20:42,426 --> 00:20:45,691
All my life I wanted someone
to love me for my sakidophalic head.

252
00:20:45,762 --> 00:20:46,854
Don't be bitter.

253
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:51,128
There aren't many of us left. We had
a sakidophalic class reunion last year.

254
00:20:51,201 --> 00:20:53,601
Not many of the old faces around anymore.

255
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,400
Well, that'll be all. You can go now.

256
00:20:58,308 --> 00:21:02,244
How come a girl like you is interested
in this anthropo... whatchamacallit?

257
00:21:02,312 --> 00:21:03,836
You see, it's this way.

258
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:07,042
I've been running around too much
with all kinds of young men.

259
00:21:07,117 --> 00:21:08,880
I just couldn't settle down...

260
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:11,819
...so my guardian suggested
I take up anthropology.

261
00:21:11,955 --> 00:21:16,358
He thought if I made a scientific study
of man, I'd become more objective...

262
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,089
...get them out of my system,
be able to control myself.

263
00:21:20,564 --> 00:21:23,294
- Has it worked?
- Almost completely.

264
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,303
I was just asking if she knew
where I could find Miss Turnstiles.

265
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:34,673
- Sure.
- Of course.

266
00:21:34,745 --> 00:21:36,940
And I was just doing a bit of research.

267
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:38,674
Dr. Kinsey, I presume.

268
00:21:38,749 --> 00:21:40,910
Really, I was just telling your friend...

269
00:21:40,984 --> 00:21:41,746
Ozzie.

270
00:21:41,818 --> 00:21:44,651
...Ozzie, what a remarkable specimen he is.

271
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:47,747
An exact throwback
to the <i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i>.

272
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:53,087
Hey, look. She's gonna put me in a book.

273
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,855
- Holy smoke!
- How about that?

274
00:21:55,932 --> 00:21:58,492
Yes, you see, there are all too few
modern males...

275
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:01,036
...who can measure up to the prehistoric.

276
00:22:01,304 --> 00:22:03,465
"Modern man is not for me

277

Watch out!

316
00:26:34,944 --> 00:26:37,469
We'd better get out of here. Come on.

317
00:26:37,781 --> 00:26:38,770
Come on.

318
00:26:52,295 --> 00:26:53,922
Come on, let's go!

319
00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:01,296
- <i>Calling car 44.</i>
- That's us.

<i>Anthropological History.</i>

<i>Investigate collapse of dinosaur.</i>

322
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:08,503
- Collapse? Why, that's terrible.
- Why?

323
00:27:08,845 --> 00:27:11,871
She's my favorite singing star,
that Dinah Shore.

324
00:27:16,486 --> 00:27:18,954
The professor at the museum
seemed miffed.

325
00:27:19,022 --> 00:27:21,422
How'd you feel if someone broke
your dinosaur?

326
00:27:21,491 --> 00:27:24,016
I never had one, we were too poor.

327
00:27:25,862 --> 00:27:28,558
Well, can I drop
the three of you someplace?

328
00:27:28,631 --> 00:27:31,122
No. We're all helping Gabey
find Miss Turnstiles.

329
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:32,896
Let's try all the other museums.

330
00:27:32,969 --> 00:27:35,938
We're stickin' with you, Gabe.
We don't give up that easy.

331
00:27:36,005 --> 00:27:37,700
Well, neither do I.

<i>Toujours I'amour.</i>

333
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:15,144
At least I'm catching up on my culture.
Where do we go from here?

334
00:28:15,211 --> 00:28:17,805
She might be at
the Symphonic Hall Building.

335
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:19,508
- Symphonic Hall?
- Yeah.

336
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:22,148
Wait a second.
I want to get something straight.

337
00:28:22,218 --> 00:28:24,550
You're all going to the Symphonic Hall?

338
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:25,280
Yeah.

339
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:27,550
If she isn't there, you'll go someplace else?

340
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:28,283
Sure.

341
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:30,155
- And then someplace else?
- Yeah.

342
00:28:30,226 --> 00:28:33,821
And you guys have to be back on the ship
at 6:00 tomorrow morning?

343
00:28:34,664 --> 00:28:37,758
Well, it seems to me if we split up,
we'd get farther.

344
00:28:38,168 --> 00:28:42,036
I mean, we'd get farther looking for her.
We'd keep looking but we'd look...

345
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:45,199
...in three different places
instead of the same place.

346
00:28:45,275 --> 00:28:50,042
Yeah. Maybe Hildy and I could go to
the subway people for some information.

347
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,079
That's a splendid idea. Ozzie and I,
we could look Miss Smith up...

348
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,744
...in the social register.
I have a copy at home.

349
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:59,219
Yeah. Yeah. That sounds practical.

350
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:00,922
Yeah. Very practical.

351
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,926
- We hate to leave you alone.
- I know you do. It's breakin' your heart.

352
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,394
- Shall we go?
- Come along, specimen.

353
00:29:07,463 --> 00:29:10,591
- Well, we'll all meet at 8:30, huh?
- Okay. Where?

354
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,862
On top of the Empire State Building?

355
00:29:12,936 --> 00:29:14,096
All right. 8:30.

356
00:29:14,237 --> 00:29:16,364
We'll see what we can get done till then.

357
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,774
Well, so long.

358
00:29:20,443 --> 00:29:21,637
Good hunting.

359
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:24,946
Which way do we go?

360
00:29:25,481 --> 00:29:27,381
The way of all flesh, Junior.

361
00:29:28,218 --> 00:29:30,118
The way of all flesh.

362
00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:36,325
- I guess we pulled that off.
- Yeah. I'm glad we're alone.

363
00:29:36,593 --> 00:29:39,187
Well, I'm glad you're glad. It's about time.

364
00:29:39,262 --> 00:29:40,786
Where'll we go first?

365
00:29:41,331 --> 00:29:45,062
Now that we're alone, you can take me
on that sightseeing tour of the city.

366
00:29:45,134 --> 00:29:47,261
I was afraid you'd remember that.

367
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:50,036
A quick tour of the city,
then up to my place.

368
00:29:50,106 --> 00:29:52,597
No. Then we gotta go looking
for Gabey's girl.

369
00:29:52,675 --> 00:29:54,768
No! Then up to my place.

370
00:29:55,478 --> 00:29:57,070
Where do you want to go first?

371

"My grandpa told me, 'Chip, my boy

1905! No wonder!

changes all the time?

- How do you do?
- Hello, Chip.

I'm sorry. I've got to inhale. Excuse me.

- Think she'll stay under there long?
- Sure. She'll be under there for days.

I'm sorry. Excuse me.

437

You know, Hildy, this is just like
taking a picture.

438
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,423
If I had a camera, I could get
the two of you together.

439
00:33:32,995 --> 00:33:35,486
You could do that by just leaving the room.

Come here.

441
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,839
- Is that you, Chip?
- No.

I've got to get some gargle.

I got the gargle.

Well, I'm very glad to hear that.

Lucy!

446
00:34:07,597 --> 00:34:10,191
Would you mind stepping
into the other room?

447
00:34:10,266 --> 00:34:13,133
- What for?
- I'd like to go over some figures with you.

448

- Figures?
- The rent, Lucy. The rent.

Hildy, we paid...

450
00:34:24,247 --> 00:34:25,737
I'm going out.

451

With that cold?

452
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:30,843
I'm going to an air-cooled movie.
Hildy says...

453
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,753
- It'll do you a world of good, Lucy.
- Yes, it will. Yes.

00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:35,984
Thanks. I'll do the same for you someday.

When will you ever get the opportunity?

456
00:34:38,594 --> 00:34:41,085
- Goodbye, Miss Shmeeler.
- Goodbye, Mr. Chips.

Just wait till I get you home.

00:35:09,091 --> 00:35:13,721
- Are you auditioning for <i>Grab Your Spats</i>?
- No, I'm only interested in classic ballet.

461
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,747
Plié!

462
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:35,478
But, Madame, my parents in Meadowville
are so proud of me.

463
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:38,384
They're so thrilled that I'm Miss Turnstiles.

464
00:35:38,454 --> 00:35:39,819
Second position.

465
00:35:40,456 --> 00:35:42,924
I know that being Miss Turnstiles
means nothing...

466
00:35:42,992 --> 00:35:45,688
...but they think it makes me
an important person.

467
00:35:45,761 --> 00:35:50,425
Gee, it'd be just terrible if they found out
I'm working as a kootch dancer.

468
00:35:50,499 --> 00:35:54,902
Third position. Me, I will not breathe
a word on them about this...

469
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:58,373
...unless I must write them
about payments.

470
00:35:59,141 --> 00:36:01,302
- Madame Dilyovska.
- Fourth position.

471
00:36:01,377 --> 00:36:03,504
Remember, you're a fortunate girl.

472
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:06,776
You study with great Dilyovska
who has taught everyone...

473
00:36:06,983 --> 00:36:10,214
...from Nijinsky to Mickey Rooney.
Fifth position.

474
00:36:10,886 --> 00:36:12,615
I will make you big star.

475
00:36:13,422 --> 00:36:16,084
I am best teacher this side of the world.

476
00:36:16,726 --> 00:36:20,753
And now, my special exercise
for the balance:

477
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:22,958
The upside-down frappé.

478
00:36:23,332 --> 00:36:25,527
One, two, three, four.

479
00:36:26,035 --> 00:36:28,401
One, two, three, four.

480
00:36:28,571 --> 00:36:30,038
Good. Good.

481
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:34,967
Very good.

482
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:44,142
Pardon me, my dear.
I will be gone only short while.

483
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,285
Keep practicing.

484
00:36:46,555 --> 00:36:47,681
Practicing.

485
00:36:49,225 --> 00:36:50,385
Yes, Madame.

486
00:36:54,897 --> 00:36:57,297
Clumsy mariner, look where you're going.

487
00:37:04,674 --> 00:37:05,606
Hey!

488
00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:10,271
- A gentleman should always knock.
- It's you, Ivy Smith.

489
00:37:10,346 --> 00:37:11,404
And what if I am?

490
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,744
I knew I'd find you!
Don't you remember me?

491
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:15,841
I'm afraid we haven't had the pleasure.

492
00:37:15,918 --> 00:37:18,648
I'm the sailor who posed with you
in the subway.

493
00:37:19,121 --> 00:37:20,952
Oh, of course.

494
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:25,022
I dimly recall, one meets so many people.

495
00:37:25,194 --> 00:37:27,424
Yeah. Yeah, I bet you do.

496
00:37:28,097 --> 00:37:30,622
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm busy.

497
00:37:31,267 --> 00:37:34,725
Listen, Ivy, you know, it was funny,
me bumping into you like this.

498
00:37:34,804 --> 00:37:38,103
I just happened to be passing
Symphonic Hall, and I said to myself:

499
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:40,233
"Gabe, my boy," that's my name, Gabey...

500
00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:42,971
"...why don't you drop in,
have a look-see at the girls?"

501
00:37:43,045 --> 00:37:46,708
I had an hour to kill, so I thought
I'd give some lucky little chick a break.

502
00:37:46,782 --> 00:37:49,046
If you play your cards right,
it could be you.

503
00:37:49,118 --> 00:37:51,143
What are you driving at?

504
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,087
I'm a pretty special guy
and you're a pretty special girl...

505
00:37:54,156 --> 00:37:57,057
...so why don't you and me
do some fancy steppin' tonight?

506
00:37:57,126 --> 00:38:01,256
Take in the swank spots. You know,
El Morocco, Stork Club, Roseland...

507
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,524
How about it?

508
00:38:02,665 --> 00:38:04,758
Of all the uncouth nerve.

509
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:08,028
- Leave at once, you sailor...
- Miss Smith, don't get excited...

510
00:38:08,104 --> 00:38:11,733
Of all the insulting lines. Do you think
I'd go out with any old sailor...

511
00:38:11,807 --> 00:38:15,299
...I've never even seen before?
Please, leave at once! I'm very busy!

512
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:18,141
I have a singing lesson upstairs,
and I've got to change.

513
00:38:21,817 --> 00:38:23,682
Okay, sister, it's your loss.

514
00:38:32,328 --> 00:38:35,297
Look, I want to apologize
for everything I just said.

515
00:38:35,998 --> 00:38:39,024
I thought I'd pull that fancy line on you
but it didn't work.

516
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:42,298
I didn't just drop in here accidentally.

517
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:45,966
I've been looking for you all day,
ever since I met you.

518
00:38:47,143 --> 00:38:47,973
Really?

519
00:38:48,043 --> 00:38:51,706
Yeah. And then finding you like this,
I guess I lost my head.

520
00:38:51,814 --> 00:38:53,782
I threw that big-shot stuff at you...

521
00:38:53,849 --> 00:38:57,717
...because I thought it was the only way
I could impress a big celebrity like you.

522
00:38:57,787 --> 00:39:02,087
You probably got millionaires,
society guys running after you all the time.

523
00:39:02,825 --> 00:39:04,315
Oh, yes.

524
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:06,856
By the droves.

525
00:39:07,496 --> 00:39:12,195
Yeah. Well, I'm sorry I bothered you.
I guess I'm a little out of my depth.

526
00:39:12,735 --> 00:39:16,466
Us small-town guys must sound silly
to a native New Yorker like you.

527
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:18,071
Oh, yes.

528
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,233
When one is a native New Yorker...

529
00:39:20,309 --> 00:39:23,608
...small town seem so provincial.

530
00:39:23,712 --> 00:39:27,739
Back home in Meadowville, Indiana,
we don't get to meet girls like you.

531
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:29,380
Meadowville?

532
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:32,147
- Yeah, did you ever hear of it?
- Oh, no.

533
00:39:32,555 --> 00:39:34,785
I probably learned about it in geography.

534
00:39:34,857 --> 00:39:37,382
I doubt that, the population's only 18,000.

535
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:39,222
That's not so small.

536
00:39:40,996 --> 00:39:44,295
- They're all people, just like anyone else.
- That's right.

537
00:39:44,366 --> 00:39:46,129
I think a small town's all right.

538
00:39:46,202 --> 00:39:49,569
It's nobody's fault if they're from there.
They're usually born there.

539
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:52,471
We big-city folk must never forget
that "the small towns...

540
00:39:52,541 --> 00:39:55,032
"...are the backbones
of the American civilization."

541
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:58,546
That's just the phrase Miss Hodges used
in my American history class.

542
00:39:58,614 --> 00:40:00,343
Did you have Miss Hodges?

543
00:40:00,616 --> 00:40:04,450
I mean, Miss Hodges is such a funny name.

544
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,809
Yeah.

545
00:40:09,892 --> 00:40:12,884
Well, tell me more about this place,
Meadowville.

546
00:40:14,029 --> 00:40:16,725
- You really want to hear about it?
- Yes.

547
00:40:19,034 --> 00:40:22,561
"There's not much to tell
about my hometown

548
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:28,132
"Life is easy and the tempo slow

549
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:33,544
"But if you really want to find what's in it

550
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:36,850
"You'll learn in a minute

551
00:40:37,419 --> 00:40:40,320
"All you have to know

552
00:40:41,557 --> 00:40:42,888
"Let's go

553
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,891
"Come walkin' with me

554
00:40:47,563 --> 00:40:51,727
"I want you to see our Main Street

555
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,429
"You'll know the whole town

556
00:40:56,705 --> 00:41:00,641
"By just walkin down our Main Street

557
00:41:03,479 --> 00:41:07,472
"There's the corner
where the boys hang out

558
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:11,117
"As each girl goes by they rate her

559
00:41:12,288 --> 00:41:16,452
"Whistle and try to date her, later

560
00:41:17,259 --> 00:41:20,285
"Baby, are you goin' steady?

561
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:24,627
"And then we can stop
and chat with the cop

562
00:41:24,767 --> 00:41:27,361
"On Main Street

563
00:41:29,805 --> 00:41:34,708
"He made an arrest way back in 1903

564
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:42,483
"He'll ask me, 'Who is the pretty stranger? '

565
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:46,209
"How proud I'm gonna be

566
00:41:47,389 --> 00:41:52,349
"When you walk down Main Street
with me

567
00:43:43,872 --> 00:43:47,808
"How proud I'm gonna be

568
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:52,878
"When you walk down Main Street...

569
00:43:53,482 --> 00:43:55,973
"...with me"

570
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:02,616
Gosh, Ivy...

571
00:44:02,991 --> 00:44:04,356
I mean, Miss Smith...

572
00:44:04,827 --> 00:44:07,762
Do you think that...
Would you go out with me tonight?

573
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:12,457
Oh, no. I'm afraid a date is quite
out of the question. I'm busy.

574
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:14,632
One of your rich boyfriends?

575
00:44:14,703 --> 00:44:16,864
Yes, one of them, or other.

576
00:44:17,806 --> 00:44:20,297
But how long are you going to be in town?

577
00:44:20,476 --> 00:44:23,707
Just today. I gotta be back on the ship
tomorrow morning.

578
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:28,272
Gabey, I'd love to go out with you tonight.

579
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:29,248
What?

580
00:44:29,518 --> 00:44:32,919
I have a big society party to go to
but I'll break the engagement.

581
00:44:32,988 --> 00:44:34,615
- You will?
- Yes.

582
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:37,919
- Shall I come and get you?
- Oh, no. I'll meet you.

583
00:44:38,193 --> 00:44:40,252
- Good. 8:30?
- 8:30.

584
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:42,527
What is here going on?

585
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:46,997
- Is this a friend of yours?
- Well, not exactly...

586
00:44:47,069 --> 00:44:48,798
Leave at once, young man.

587
00:44:50,806 --> 00:44:52,831
Well, goodbye. About 8:30.

588
00:44:53,342 --> 00:44:54,331
8:30.

589
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:56,573
On your way, bell-bottom.

590
00:44:58,614 --> 00:45:01,378
Madame Dilyovska, I'm going out
with him tonight.

591
00:45:03,318 --> 00:45:04,307
Where?

592
00:45:06,321 --> 00:45:08,016
We forgot to say where!

593
00:45:11,527 --> 00:45:13,392
Top of the Empire State Building.

594
00:45:13,462 --> 00:45:15,020
But it's so high up.

595
00:45:15,097 --> 00:45:18,692
It won't seem high to me.
I'm in the clouds right now.

596
00:45:36,585 --> 00:45:41,249
You will not keep that date. You will be
at your job at Coney Island tonight.

597
00:45:41,356 --> 00:45:43,415
But Madame Dilyovska, just this once...

598
00:45:43,492 --> 00:45:47,360
"Meadowville, Indiana.
Dear Mr. And Mrs. Smith:"

599
00:45:47,429 --> 00:45:50,523
- What are you doing?
- I am composing letter to your parents.

600
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,328
I will be at Coney Island tonight at 12:00...

601
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:58,529
...and if you are not there at that time
I shall regretfully have to mail it.

602
00:45:58,607 --> 00:46:00,666
Madame Dilyovska, you wouldn't do that!

603
00:46:00,742 --> 00:46:01,800
Why not?

604
00:46:01,877 --> 00:46:03,504
But I have to meet him.

605
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:05,703
I'll leave him at 11:30.

606
00:46:05,781 --> 00:46:09,217
You would better leave him at 11:30 or...

607
00:46:26,635 --> 00:46:30,230
Look, there's Grant's Tomb.
I can see it just like in the pictures.

608
00:46:30,305 --> 00:46:31,465
Let me see.

609
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:35,969
It says it was built in 1897 and
more than 15 million people have seen it.

610
00:46:37,145 --> 00:46:38,544
How do you like that?

611
00:46:38,614 --> 00:46:41,447
Hey, this thing's quit.
Have you got another dime?

612
00:46:41,817 --> 00:46:44,786
What do you want a dime for?
You can see me for nothing.

613
00:46:44,853 --> 00:46:46,013
I got one.

614
00:46:50,459 --> 00:46:53,690
Look, there's Symphonic Hall.
And it's so close, too.

615
00:46:56,398 --> 00:46:59,196
You know, Hildy,
I feel kind of guilty about Gabey.

616
00:46:59,701 --> 00:47:01,828
He's my pal and he looks after me.

617
00:47:02,404 --> 00:47:04,895
I mean, maybe we should have looked
for Ivy Smith.

618
00:47:04,973 --> 00:47:08,374
Here we go again. I tell you,
we never could have found her.

619
00:47:08,443 --> 00:47:10,240
Yeah, I guess you're right.

620
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:14,943
There's the George Washington Bridge.
And the Music Hall.

621
00:47:15,384 --> 00:47:18,751
Why didn't I come up here sooner?
I wasted my whole day away.

622
00:47:19,288 --> 00:47:20,516
Thanks a lot.

623
00:47:24,393 --> 00:47:26,452
Hildy, I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.

624
00:47:26,528 --> 00:47:29,725
Get back to your telescope.
You two make a lovely couple.

625
00:47:29,965 --> 00:47:33,162
I don't want to look through the telescope.
I'd rather look at you.

626
00:47:33,235 --> 00:47:35,066
Whisper sweet nothings in my ear...

627
00:47:35,137 --> 00:47:38,538
...like the population of the Bronx
or how many hot dogs were sold...

628
00:47:38,607 --> 00:47:40,268
...last year at Yankee Stadium.

629
00:47:40,342 --> 00:47:44,608
Please, Hildy, don't be mad. I like you.
I think you're very pretty.

630
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,342
You're the prettiest cab driver
I've ever seen.

631
00:47:47,916 --> 00:47:51,181
Tell it to your guidebook.
It means more to you than I do.

632
00:47:52,421 --> 00:47:53,445
There.

633
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:56,890
Chip, you care.

634
00:47:58,293 --> 00:47:59,920
Why didn't you tell me?

635
00:48:00,862 --> 00:48:02,523
Gee, I don't know.

636
00:48:04,032 --> 00:48:06,159
"I'd like to whisper sweet nothings

637
00:48:06,802 --> 00:48:10,260
"Those words that everyone knows

638
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,705
"But my thoughts get mangled

639
00:48:14,576 --> 00:48:17,010
"And all the words get tangled

640
00:48:18,647 --> 00:48:22,174
"But since you ask me, here goes

641
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,152
"You're awful

642
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:31,354
"Awful good to look at

643
00:48:32,694 --> 00:48:35,356
"Awful nice to be with

644
00:48:36,665 --> 00:48:40,226
"Awful sweet to have and hold

645
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:43,565
"You're nothin'

646
00:48:45,207 --> 00:48:47,038
"Nothin' if not lovely

647
00:48:49,311 --> 00:48:51,506
"Nothin' if not dazzling

"Nothin' but pure gold

649
00:48:58,286 --> 00:49:00,481
"You're frightening

650
00:49:01,323 --> 00:49:05,657
"Frightening me when you say
That you might go away

651
00:49:06,862 --> 00:49:08,489
"You're boring

652
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:13,692
"Boring into my heart to stay

653
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:17,065
"You're cheap, dear

654
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:20,439
"Cheap at any price, dear

655
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:24,435
"Cheap for such a diamond

656
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:28,675
"Cheap for such a pearl

00:49:40,462 --> 00:49:44,922
"Awful nice to be my girl

"Old with worldly wisdom

00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:57,567
"Old like Gorgonzola

"Old like vintage French champagne

00:51:16,558 --> 00:51:17,525
Chip!

680
00:51:19,427 --> 00:51:21,486
Hey, Oz! How are you?

681
00:51:24,266 --> 00:51:26,928
Wow! What a view!

682
00:51:29,738 --> 00:51:31,729
Glad I didn't join the Air Force.

683
00:51:32,107 --> 00:51:34,041
Did you find Miss Turnstiles?

684
00:51:34,609 --> 00:51:36,702
Not exactly. But I looked.

685
00:51:36,778 --> 00:51:38,268
Yeah, I looked, too.

686
00:51:38,647 --> 00:51:39,511
Yeah.

687
00:51:39,581 --> 00:51:40,445
Yeah.

688
00:51:40,815 --> 00:51:43,283
Well, tough luck not finding her.

689
00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:45,711
This must be the place.

690
00:51:45,787 --> 00:51:47,015
- Gabey!
- Hiya!

691
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:48,678
- How are you?
- How you doin'?

692
00:51:48,757 --> 00:51:51,248
You'd think they hadn't seen each other
in years.

693
00:51:51,326 --> 00:51:53,226
Hiya, Claire. Hiya, Hildy.

694
00:51:55,664 --> 00:51:57,393
Gabe, I tried to find her.

695
00:51:57,632 --> 00:52:00,624
We looked all over. But let's face it,
the town's too big.

696
00:52:00,702 --> 00:52:04,729
Sure, sure. Say, what's the matter?
Did you get into a fight?

697
00:52:06,308 --> 00:52:09,106
- How did that get there?
- You know, Gabe, I saw her, too.

698
00:52:09,177 --> 00:52:10,644
- Yeah?
- Just for a flash.

699
00:52:10,712 --> 00:52:12,270
- Where?
- In Yonkers.

700
00:52:12,347 --> 00:52:14,474
A lot of photographers around her.

701
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:16,881
Just had a quick flash and then I lost her.

702
00:52:16,952 --> 00:52:19,318
- The town's pretty big, Gabe.
- Too big, yeah.

703
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:20,649
Too big. Yeah.

704
00:52:20,755 --> 00:52:24,213
Look, fellas, don't worry about me.
I'm all booked up for tonight.

705
00:52:24,292 --> 00:52:25,657
Yeah? Nice girl?

706
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,694
Sure.

707
00:52:26,895 --> 00:52:28,021
Ivy Smith.

708
00:52:28,096 --> 00:52:30,724
- No! Miss Turnstiles?
- What're you trying to put over?

709
00:52:30,799 --> 00:52:34,326
So help me, fellas, I found her.
She ought to be here any minute.

710
00:52:37,005 --> 00:52:39,166
- Hey, look! Cops!
- Duck, everybody!

711
00:52:39,841 --> 00:52:43,709
I'm sure he's up here, that sailor,
looks like the statue of Pithecanthropus.

712
00:52:43,778 --> 00:52:45,837
We'll take a look around the building.

713
00:52:49,017 --> 00:52:51,679
- Hey, that's my boss!
- Here, try these for size.

714
00:52:51,853 --> 00:52:54,981
- Do you recognize the other guy?
- The professor from the museum!

715
00:52:55,056 --> 00:52:58,287
- He seems to be looking for someone.
- Guess who, specimen?

716
00:53:00,996 --> 00:53:02,930
Hey, what am I gonna do?

717
00:53:03,465 --> 00:53:07,526
- I've gotta hide. Where am I gonna hide?
- There's no hiding place up here.

718
00:53:08,103 --> 00:53:09,001
Come on.

719
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:11,402
My dinosaur... ruined. He broke it.

720
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,173
Look. Sailors.

721
00:53:18,146 --> 00:53:20,876
- Having fun, kids?
- Yeah. Swell view from up here.

722
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:24,476
Do you happen to know another sailor,
a fellow who goes to museums?

723
00:53:24,552 --> 00:53:29,455
Museums? Please. Sailors got other ways
of studying natural history.

724
00:53:30,325 --> 00:53:33,419
You haven't seen another sailor
hanging around here, have you?

725
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:37,860
No. We haven't seen anyone
hanging around here.

726
00:53:42,837 --> 00:53:44,327
What's the matter with you?

727
00:53:44,739 --> 00:53:46,707
The altitude. It makes me sleepy.

728
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:57,074
You say this sailor was at the Museum
of Anthropological History today at 11:30?

729
00:53:57,352 --> 00:53:58,182
Yes.

730
00:53:58,253 --> 00:53:59,618
You're sure of his description?

731
00:53:59,688 --> 00:54:02,589
I'll never forget him.
He has black hair, blue eyes...

732
00:54:02,657 --> 00:54:04,852
...about five feet, eleven inches tall...

733
00:54:04,926 --> 00:54:09,056
...Iooks exactly like the statue of
<i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i>, exactly.

734
00:54:09,297 --> 00:54:11,925
We're looking for three sailors
and a lady cab driver.

735
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:16,895
A lady cab driver! Oh, how revolting!
Claire, did you ever...

736
00:54:20,375 --> 00:54:23,867
You haven't seen 'em? Come along, Tracy.
I guess they're not up here.

737
00:54:24,112 --> 00:54:27,809
Awe-inspirin', isn't it?
Majestic, that's what it is.

738
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:31,113
- It does a man's soul good to...
- Come on, Tracy.

739
00:54:38,626 --> 00:54:40,457
What's the matter? Lose something?

740
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:44,123
- You poor darling! You brave thing!
- Why didn't you get rid of 'em sooner?

741
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:46,963
All these hours in the air!
I could get my wings for this.

742
00:54:47,035 --> 00:54:49,833
- Or a striped suit. Let's go.
- No, I gotta wait for Ivy.

743
00:54:49,904 --> 00:54:52,372
I don't believe you met her at all.
Where is she?

744
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:56,376
She had some big society affair to go to.
Maybe she had trouble breaking it.

745
00:54:57,011 --> 00:55:00,071
Society affair? What does he think
Miss Turnstiles is?

746
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:03,544
He thinks she's a big celebrity.
Why tell him she's nobody?

747
00:55:03,618 --> 00:55:05,142
It's his one day in town.

748
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,517
Oh, I get it.

749
00:55:07,288 --> 00:55:10,780
I don't know what could have happened.
She promised me she'd be here.

750
00:55:12,026 --> 00:55:12,958
Ivy!

751
00:55:13,061 --> 00:55:15,222
Gabey! I'm sorry I'm late. But...

752
00:55:15,296 --> 00:55:16,957
I thought you'd never get here.

753
00:55:17,031 --> 00:55:20,523
I had a lot of trouble breaking
my engagement, but I'm glad I did.

754
00:55:20,602 --> 00:55:24,333
Me, too. Well, here she is, Miss Turnstiles.

755
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:25,929
What do you know?

756
00:55:26,007 --> 00:55:29,568
Ivy, this is Hildy, Claire, Ozzie, Chip.

757
00:55:30,678 --> 00:55:33,146
Ladies and gentlemen, we're off on a lark.

758
00:55:33,448 --> 00:55:35,916
I've got one suggestion before we embark.

759
00:55:36,184 --> 00:55:38,914
There are lots of nice things
to do in the dark...

760
00:55:38,987 --> 00:55:42,320
...but let's not go rowing in Central Park.

761
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:45,392
"We're going on the town

762
00:55:45,693 --> 00:55:46,717
"New York

763

"We're gonna really sock it

00:55:53,301 --> 00:55:55,098
"Because tonight's the night

Best you've got.

I'm sorry, sir. We are all filled up.

All filled up? I hear that's what
they always say in New York.

You better start scraping and bowing now
because the lady with me...

836
01:00:18,132 --> 01:00:20,999
...happens to be none other than
the famous Miss Turnstiles.

Gabey, please...

838
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:25,034
Miss Turnstiles? What are you
talking about? No room.

839
01:00:25,106 --> 01:00:27,939
Hey, you heard me. Miss Turnstiles
for June. Ivy Smith.

840
01:00:28,009 --> 01:00:30,705
What is this, Miss Turnstiles?
Go away, Sailor.

841
01:00:32,847 --> 01:00:35,145
Hey, François! Build us a table, will you?

842
01:00:35,216 --> 01:00:37,582
I'm sorry, madame. There are no tables.

843
01:00:38,352 --> 01:00:40,252
Of course, madame. A table, surely.

844
01:00:40,321 --> 01:00:41,583
Garçon! Table.

845
01:00:41,656 --> 01:00:45,285
See that girl over there? Make a big fuss
over her. Miss Turnstiles.

846
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:49,420
- Miss Turnstiles? What is that?
- Never mind. Just make a fuss. Go ahead.

847
01:00:49,764 --> 01:00:53,791
Miss Turnstiles! We are so proud
and happy to have you here.

848
01:00:53,968 --> 01:00:58,530
Please come in. Our humble establishment
welcomes you with wide open doors.

849
01:01:13,588 --> 01:01:15,954
There, you see! It worked like a charm.

850
01:01:16,023 --> 01:01:17,888
It was nothing, really.

851
01:01:18,126 --> 01:01:20,594
Gosh, this is a great table, huh?

852
01:01:20,862 --> 01:01:21,829
Yeah.

853
01:01:22,497 --> 01:01:23,828
Those girls are pretty.

854
01:01:26,033 --> 01:01:27,933
Well, folks, what will it be?

855
01:01:29,604 --> 01:01:32,539
Say, what's in this Explodo Bomborino?
Sounds good.

856
01:01:32,707 --> 01:01:35,938
Four kinds of rum, brandy, grenadine,
lime juice, papaya juice...

857
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:38,843
...and the white of one duck egg.
Only 12 to a customer.

858
01:01:38,913 --> 01:01:40,972
How about this one,
Dreamland Nightmare?

859
01:01:41,048 --> 01:01:44,142
Vodka, champagne, prune juice,
floating chopped chives...

860
01:01:44,218 --> 01:01:46,982
- He'll have a beer.
- Yeah, beer all around.

861
01:01:48,856 --> 01:01:50,483
Pardon me, madame.

862
01:01:50,558 --> 01:01:55,188
I'm so sorry. It was an accident.
I didn't really mean to sit on your lap.

863
01:01:55,296 --> 01:01:58,129
I hope you all aren't hurt,
but I was pushed and...

864
01:01:58,199 --> 01:01:59,188
Scram!

865
01:02:00,434 --> 01:02:01,526
Hey, look!

866
01:02:04,505 --> 01:02:06,530
Look out! Here she comes again!

867
01:02:07,341 --> 01:02:10,174
- Where are those drinks?
- Here you are, folks.

868
01:02:14,682 --> 01:02:17,446
Just what I wanted. A mug of solid glass.

869
01:02:20,955 --> 01:02:23,856
"That's all there is, folks!
So, goodnight to you

870
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:27,492
"We hope you like
our Sambacabana review!"

871
01:02:36,537 --> 01:02:39,165
Come on, let's dance
before the stampede starts.

872
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:42,008
All right, specimen. Let's go primitive.

873
01:02:46,013 --> 01:02:47,674
Just a minute, Ozzie.

874
01:02:48,082 --> 01:02:49,549
- Oh, François?
- Yes, madame?

875
01:02:49,617 --> 01:02:51,881
Champagne, compliments of the house?

876
01:02:51,986 --> 01:02:55,285
Yes, madame. With pleasure.
Compliments of the house.

877
01:02:59,527 --> 01:03:02,155
Luckily we got leave
when we hit here, otherwise...

878
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:05,688
Champagne for Miss Turnstiles.
Compliments of the house.

879
01:03:07,001 --> 01:03:09,401
Thank you. Isn't that nice?

880
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:11,260
Gee, that's terrific.

881
01:03:11,639 --> 01:03:15,040
Gosh, I guess this happens to you
all the time, wherever you go.

882
01:03:15,109 --> 01:03:17,077
Yes, on and off.

883
01:03:19,313 --> 01:03:20,712
What shall we drink to?

884
01:03:20,781 --> 01:03:22,612
Let's drink to New York.

885
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:23,908
New York.

886
01:03:28,856 --> 01:03:31,188
It must be so exciting in the Navy.

887
01:03:31,592 --> 01:03:35,494
You go all over the world
from one big city to another, and...

888
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:38,498
...you see all kinds of strange places...

889
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:42,395
...and you meet all kinds of girls.

890
01:03:42,603 --> 01:03:46,630
Yeah, well, when you only spend
a short time in some place you...

891
01:03:46,807 --> 01:03:50,243
...don't want to get too involved
with any one particular girl.

892
01:03:50,311 --> 01:03:53,041
I mean, you might never see her again.

893
01:03:54,682 --> 01:03:58,846
Of course, it's best to just have
a good time and not think about tomorrow.

894
01:04:00,054 --> 01:04:03,956
Yeah, when we push off tomorrow,
I guess this'll all seem like a dream.

895
01:04:05,293 --> 01:04:09,320
That's why I think it's silly to get
too involved, because...

896
01:04:10,331 --> 01:04:11,320
I know.

897
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:14,067
Getting involved, it's so...

898
01:04:15,303 --> 01:04:17,794
...so involving.

899
01:04:29,717 --> 01:04:30,775
Oh, Ivy.

900
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:35,017
Wait! Don't tell us.

901
01:04:35,756 --> 01:04:39,419
You were just asking this young lady
where you could find Miss Turnstiles.

902
01:04:39,493 --> 01:04:42,360
- Look! Champagne.
- The guy just come over and said:

903
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:45,160
"Champagne for Miss Turnstiles.
Compliments of the house."

904
01:04:45,232 --> 01:04:46,256
Real champagne?

905
01:04:46,334 --> 01:04:50,134
Yeah, not cream soda, not celery tonic,
but real champagne.

906
01:04:51,105 --> 01:04:54,131
This is great.
I never had champagne before.

907
01:04:54,241 --> 01:04:57,836
Ozzie, if you say the bubbles
tickle your nose, I'll drown you.

908
01:04:58,379 --> 01:05:01,610
- Let's have a toast.
- All right. This one's for the boys.

909
01:05:01,849 --> 01:05:04,443
Here's to the girls we found
in the great big city.

910
01:05:04,518 --> 01:05:07,646
And this one's for the girls.
Here's to being found.

911
01:05:14,695 --> 01:05:17,129
"That's all there is, folks
So goodnight to you

912
01:05:17,198 --> 01:05:20,258
"We hope you liked our little
Dixieland Revue"

913
01:05:27,408 --> 01:05:28,739
Come on, let's dance.

914
01:05:28,809 --> 01:05:31,004
We'd just go out and get crushed to death.

915
01:05:31,078 --> 01:05:32,568
What a way to die.

916
01:05:39,053 --> 01:05:43,251
Ivy, I didn't mean what I said
about not getting involved with a girl...

917
01:05:43,357 --> 01:05:45,257
...I may never see again.

918
01:05:45,326 --> 01:05:46,190
No?

919
01:05:46,994 --> 01:05:51,192
No. This isn't just one of those things
where a sailor picks up a girl...

920
01:05:51,332 --> 01:05:55,234
...for just one day. I have a feeling
I'm going to see you again.

921
01:05:55,736 --> 01:05:57,203
I'm so glad you said that...

922
01:05:57,271 --> 01:06:01,367
I know you're glamorous and famous, Ivy,
and maybe you came along tonight...

923
01:06:01,442 --> 01:06:05,208
...just to be nice to a guy on leave...
- That's not true, Gabey.

924
01:06:05,346 --> 01:06:08,076
I came along tonight
because I wanted to be with you...

925
01:06:08,149 --> 01:06:10,515
...more than anything else in the world.

926
01:06:10,584 --> 01:06:11,642
Honest?

927
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:13,349
Yes, Gabey.

928
01:06:13,854 --> 01:06:16,516
Then I know we're gonna see
each other again.

929
01:06:16,657 --> 01:06:19,251
In the meantime, we have the whole night
ahead of us.

930
01:06:19,326 --> 01:06:21,794
- It's only 11:30 now and...
- 11:30!

931
01:06:21,896 --> 01:06:23,761
Yeah. What's the matter, Ivy?

932
01:06:24,064 --> 01:06:27,830
Gabey, I don't know
how to tell you this but...

933
01:06:28,202 --> 01:06:29,669
Ivy, what is it?

934
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:32,500
Gabey, I've something to tell you.

935
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,232
Hey, Gabe, Gabey!

936
01:06:34,341 --> 01:06:35,672
Hiya, Gabe.

937
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:38,442
Hey, Simpkins, Kovarski.

938
01:06:38,779 --> 01:06:41,043
Say, there are two guys from my ship.

939
01:06:41,148 --> 01:06:44,879
Ivy, I want them to meet you in person.
Wait here, I'll bring 'em right over.

940
01:06:44,952 --> 01:06:47,113
- But Gabey...
- I'll only be a second.

941
01:06:48,556 --> 01:06:51,787
Hiya, fellas.
How's the big town treatin' ya?

942
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:54,686
- Not bad, not bad. Daisy, Ella, Gabe.
- Hello, girls.

943
01:06:54,762 --> 01:06:57,094
How's the Meadowville menace doin'?

944
01:06:57,164 --> 01:06:58,756
I hit the jackpot today.

945
01:06:58,833 --> 01:07:01,631
Nothin' much, just the most famous girl
in New York City.

946
01:07:01,702 --> 01:07:03,602
Who, the Statue of Liberty?

947
01:07:03,671 --> 01:07:06,606
Twice as famous, Miss Turnstiles for June.

948
01:07:06,674 --> 01:07:09,507
- Yeah? Who's that?
- Who's that? Are you kiddin'?

949
01:07:09,577 --> 01:07:11,636
Her picture's up all over the subway...

950
01:07:11,712 --> 01:07:12,701
Where is she?

951
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:15,544
Over here. Come over to the table.
I'll introduce you.

952
01:07:15,616 --> 01:07:18,210
- Excuse us, girls. We'll be right back.
- Excuse us.

953
01:07:18,819 --> 01:07:21,549
The grass is always greener,
if you know what I mean.

954
01:07:21,956 --> 01:07:23,651
How'd you meet a dame like that?

955
01:07:23,724 --> 01:07:27,990
Magnetism, boys, sheer magnetism.
She was drawn to me...

956
01:07:29,497 --> 01:07:32,955
- She must have gone to powder her nose.
- Oh, sure. Yeah.

957
01:07:38,672 --> 01:07:40,833
I'll introduce you later, fellas.

958
01:07:49,316 --> 01:07:50,180
Gabe.

959
01:07:50,251 --> 01:07:53,687
- I just stepped out for a bit of air.
- Yeah, we read the note.

960
01:07:54,088 --> 01:07:55,316
Too bad, Gabe.

961
01:07:55,389 --> 01:07:58,586
What do you mean? As a matter of fact,
I'm kind of relieved.

962
01:07:58,659 --> 01:08:01,219
You know these famous gals,
so stuck on themselves.

963
01:08:01,295 --> 01:08:04,492
Who needs 'em? Now that I'm on my own,
I'll have me a real time.

964
01:08:04,565 --> 01:08:06,897
So long, girls.
See you back on the ship, guys.

965
01:08:06,967 --> 01:08:09,936
Why don't you stick with us?
You could get another date.

966
01:08:10,004 --> 01:08:12,871
Claire'll get you a date.
Claire, how about a girl for Gabe?

967
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:14,305
I don't know any girls.

968
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:17,003
I can get you a date.
My roommate, Lucy Shmeeler.

969
01:08:17,077 --> 01:08:17,907
What?

970
01:08:17,978 --> 01:08:20,708
She's a nice girl.
She hasn't been out in years.

971
01:08:20,948 --> 01:08:23,542
- She's swell. You'll like her.
- You'll like her.

972
01:08:23,617 --> 01:08:25,676
How about it? I can phone her right now.

973
01:08:25,753 --> 01:08:28,586
Sure. Why not? The night's young.
Come on.

974
01:08:28,656 --> 01:08:31,216
We'll paint this town pink,
green and yellow.

975
01:08:31,292 --> 01:08:32,919
Get in there. Come on.

976
01:08:42,469 --> 01:08:44,903
"That's all there is, folks
So goodnight to you

977
01:08:44,972 --> 01:08:47,634
"We hope you liked our little
Shanghai Revue"

978
01:08:54,548 --> 01:08:56,038
- How you doin', Gabe?
- Great.

979
01:08:56,116 --> 01:08:58,584
Not thinking about that Miss Turnstiles,
are you?

980
01:08:58,652 --> 01:09:01,177
Who's that? Never heard of her.
Bottoms up.

981
01:09:01,956 --> 01:09:04,049
Where's that heavy date you promised me?

982
01:09:04,124 --> 01:09:06,957
- What's keeping Miss Shmeeler?
- She should be here by now.

983
01:09:07,027 --> 01:09:10,690
When I told her about Gabey, she was
out of the house before I could hang up.

984
01:09:10,764 --> 01:09:13,164
- Playin' hard to get, huh?
- Where is she?

985
01:09:14,101 --> 01:09:15,261
Hello, Lucy.

986
01:09:15,936 --> 01:09:18,700
Hello. Oh, hello, Chip.

987
01:09:24,044 --> 01:09:26,205
Well, now we've all got dates.

988
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:28,941
Lucy, this is Claire, and this is...

989
01:09:29,016 --> 01:09:31,849
Don't tell me. I know.
I'll bet you're Gabey.

990
01:09:32,152 --> 01:09:34,143
No. He's the lucky fellow.

991
01:09:34,321 --> 01:09:36,084
The luck of the Irish.

992
01:09:36,957 --> 01:09:40,552
- Won't you sit down, Miss Shmeeler?
- Thank you, thank you. Yes.

993
01:09:42,997 --> 01:09:44,294
Gesundheit.

994
01:09:44,865 --> 01:09:48,096
That's the nicest thing
anybody ever said to me.

995
01:09:49,036 --> 01:09:50,765
Here. You got a cold, huh?

996
01:09:50,838 --> 01:09:52,965
It's just a little sniffle.

997
01:09:54,475 --> 01:09:56,943
Nothing a ton of penicillin won't cure.

998
01:09:57,144 --> 01:10:01,638
But it's not catching.
No, not even if you get real close.

999
01:10:07,054 --> 01:10:08,885
Come on, Hildy. We'd better dance.

1000
01:10:10,457 --> 01:10:11,947
Let's go, Claire.

1001
01:10:14,528 --> 01:10:16,655
Have a drink, Miss Shmeeler.

1002
01:10:16,897 --> 01:10:18,421
I don't mind if I do.

1003
01:10:19,099 --> 01:10:21,932
You know, I was planning
a quiet evening at home...

1004
01:10:22,136 --> 01:10:26,596
...but when Hildy called and said that
the Navy was in distress, well, I just flew.

1005
01:10:27,007 --> 01:10:30,773
Hildy can tell you
I'm just "a streetcar named impulsive."

1006
01:10:31,512 --> 01:10:33,844
- Well, here's to...
- Here's to us.

1007
01:10:38,385 --> 01:10:39,750
My, that's strong.

1008
01:10:40,421 --> 01:10:44,016
- Did you see <i>The Lost Weekend</i>?
- See it? I feel as though I was in it.

1009
01:10:44,091 --> 01:10:46,389
I mean, until you came along, Lucy.

1010
01:10:46,994 --> 01:10:49,224
That calls for a real toast!

1011
01:10:49,863 --> 01:10:51,956
Let's pretend this is champagne.

1012
01:10:52,032 --> 01:10:52,862
Champagne?

1013
01:10:52,933 --> 01:10:56,164
Yes, and we'll do the real
old-fashioned champagne toast.

1014
01:10:56,403 --> 01:10:58,496
- Let's interlock arms...
- No, really...

1015
01:10:58,572 --> 01:11:00,597
Come on. It's so Viennese!

1016
01:11:00,674 --> 01:11:01,902
Hey, Gabe!

1017
01:11:02,376 --> 01:11:03,400
Hiya.

1018
01:11:06,447 --> 01:11:08,312
- It's a small world.
- Hello, fellas.

1019
01:11:08,382 --> 01:11:11,840
- How about that introduction?
- Go away. Can't you see I'm busy?

1020
01:11:11,919 --> 01:11:15,184
Give us a break. We want to see
the most beautiful gal in New York.

1021
01:11:15,255 --> 01:11:17,155
We wanna meet the little bombshell.

1022
01:11:17,224 --> 01:11:21,320
- Come on, fellas. You know how it is.
- Gabey, you're smothering me.

1023
01:11:21,662 --> 01:11:22,651
Hello.

1024
01:11:27,835 --> 01:11:32,397
Miss Shmeeler, this is First Class Seamen
Simpkins and Kovarski.

1025
01:11:33,307 --> 01:11:37,209
- Pleased to meet you, miss.
- Yeah. We been lookin' forward to this.

1026
01:11:38,512 --> 01:11:41,913
It'll give us a lot to talk about
back on the ship, won't it, Gabe?

1027
01:11:41,982 --> 01:11:42,812
Yeah.

1028
01:11:42,883 --> 01:11:44,544
Well, so long.

1029
01:11:44,752 --> 01:11:45,741
Goodbye.

1030
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:48,388
Magnetism, that's what it is.

1031
01:11:49,757 --> 01:11:51,156
Sheer magnetism.

1032
01:11:54,795 --> 01:11:55,819
Goodbye.

1033
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:58,254
Oh, they're sweet.

1034
01:12:00,567 --> 01:12:03,593
Excuse me a minute, Lucy.
I gotta get some cigarettes.

1035
01:12:07,241 --> 01:12:09,505
I don't think Gabey's very happy
about this.

1036
01:12:09,576 --> 01:12:11,771
Amazing. Amazing deduction.

1037
01:12:13,347 --> 01:12:14,279
Look!

1038
01:12:23,524 --> 01:12:24,957
Drinkin' alone, partner?

1039
01:12:25,025 --> 01:12:26,686
We don't like that around here!

1040
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,318
We don't cotton to it nohow.

1041
01:12:28,395 --> 01:12:30,386
Looks like you're trying to ditch us.

1042
01:12:30,464 --> 01:12:33,456
You can't get away with it.
Reckon you're stuck with us.

1043
01:12:33,534 --> 01:12:35,661
Yep! We're your pals, pal!

1044
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:39,667
"Oh, when you feel downhearted
You must remember this

1045
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:42,670
"Things never are as bad as they could be

1046

You can count on me

1048
01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:50,617
"Yeah!

1049
01:12:50,784 --> 01:12:53,048
"You can count on me

It was very nice of you to take me home.

01:16:15,455 --> 01:16:17,480
That's all right, Lucy. And thanks.

1112
01:16:17,557 --> 01:16:19,582
Would you like to come up for a minute?

1113
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:22,685
No, I guess not.
The others are waiting for me.

1114
01:16:22,829 --> 01:16:25,297
Besides, I'm not
very good company tonight.

1115
01:16:26,066 --> 01:16:28,125
I guess I showed you a pretty dull time.

1116
01:16:28,201 --> 01:16:30,601
Oh, no! I had a marvelous time.

1117
01:16:31,571 --> 01:16:34,199
At last I have something
to write in my diary.

1118
01:16:34,508 --> 01:16:36,840
I've been using it for laundry lists.

1119
01:16:37,511 --> 01:16:40,105
No, really, I'm sorry about tonight, Lucy.

1120
01:16:41,048 --> 01:16:45,178
You know, somewhere in the world
there's a right girl for every boy.

1121
01:16:46,386 --> 01:16:49,617
I guess I found the one for me
before I even met you.

1122
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:53,282
I tried, but I can't forget her.

1123
01:16:54,428 --> 01:16:55,918
But don't you worry.

1124
01:16:56,463 --> 01:16:58,021
You'll find your guy.

1125

You're a nice girl, Lucy.

1126
01:17:03,570 --> 01:17:04,696
Goodnight.

1127
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:06,270
Oh, you bad boy.

1128
01:17:07,007 --> 01:17:09,271
Now, I won't wash my cheek for a year.

1129

Goodnight.

"A Day In New York.

"A comedy in three acts."

01:25:01,114 --> 01:25:02,206
Hey, Gabe!

1133
01:25:02,615 --> 01:25:03,741
Hello, Chip.

1134
01:25:03,816 --> 01:25:06,284
I got kind of worried
that you wouldn't come back.

1135
01:25:06,352 --> 01:25:08,047
Thanks, Chip. I'm okay.

1136
01:25:09,589 --> 01:25:12,057
I know how tough you're takin' this, Gabe.

1137
01:25:12,425 --> 01:25:15,155
I know you know. That's why I love you.

1138
01:25:16,563 --> 01:25:17,655
Come on.

1139
01:25:23,836 --> 01:25:27,567
When I danced in Imperial Palace
before Czar, he wept...

1140
01:25:27,674 --> 01:25:31,770
...tears streaming on floor.
I had to do next number in galoshes.

1141
01:25:31,844 --> 01:25:33,778
- Madame Dilyovska.
- Yes, what is it?

1142
01:25:33,846 --> 01:25:35,245
Miss Smith's young friend.

1143
01:25:35,315 --> 01:25:36,976
- Where is she?
- Who?

1144
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:41,043
Ivy Smith. She had to go to a big society
party. Maybe you know where she is.

1145
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:45,716
Big society party! This party is at
Coney Island, the playground of the rich.

1146
01:25:45,825 --> 01:25:48,555
- Coney Island!
- Yes, at Tilyou Avenue and the Boardwalk.

1147
01:25:48,628 --> 01:25:49,686
I know where she is.

1148
01:25:49,762 --> 01:25:51,559
- What's she doing there?
- I don't know.

1149
01:25:51,631 --> 01:25:52,689
Let's go.

1150
01:25:52,765 --> 01:25:55,495
I know the shortest way out.
We'll be there in no time.

1151
01:25:56,169 --> 01:25:59,002
- Lf I don't get my cab back...
- Look! That's them!

1152
01:25:59,072 --> 01:26:00,437
That's the cab.

1153
01:26:00,506 --> 01:26:01,871
Hey, you, stop!

1154
01:26:12,518 --> 01:26:13,712
Hey, fellows...

1155
01:26:13,786 --> 01:26:15,117
...where's the fire?

1156
01:26:16,422 --> 01:26:19,619
We're the fire! Hey, it's them!
They're after us!

1157
01:26:19,692 --> 01:26:20,784
- Who?
- The cops!

1158
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:22,555
- Hildy, step on it.
- Okay.

1159
01:26:25,531 --> 01:26:28,523
Hildy, they're catching up with us.
I can see their faces.

1160
01:26:28,601 --> 01:26:30,660
It's no fun for them, either.
They can see yours.

1161
01:26:30,737 --> 01:26:32,329
Do you think we can lose them?

1162
01:26:32,405 --> 01:26:35,568
I know a place across the Brooklyn Bridge
where no one'll find us.

1163
01:26:35,642 --> 01:26:37,200
- What is it?
- Brooklyn.

1164
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:55,457
Get up there. You can see better.

1165
01:26:55,762 --> 01:26:57,024
Are they close?

1166
01:26:57,630 --> 01:26:59,825
Any closer and we'd be chasin' them.

1167
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,192
- You better go faster.
- Hurry.

1168
01:27:02,268 --> 01:27:04,168
- Give her the gun.
- Hold on.

1169
01:27:04,337 --> 01:27:08,034
All police cars in the vicinity. Coming off
the east end of Brooklyn Bridge.

1170
01:27:08,107 --> 01:27:10,234
- <i>Heading east.</i>
- Okay. Let's go.

1171
01:27:16,082 --> 01:27:17,674
We just picked up another one!

1172
01:27:46,045 --> 01:27:49,014
- I bet we're losing 'em.
- They're multiplying like schmos.

1173
01:27:49,082 --> 01:27:50,879
Pull into that fruit stand!

1174
01:28:03,029 --> 01:28:05,520
I wonder who's minding the police station?

1175
01:28:26,185 --> 01:28:30,053
This is Tilyou Avenue and the Boardwalk.
I wonder what she could be doing here.

1176
01:28:30,123 --> 01:28:32,921
- Doesn't look like a society party to me.
- Shut up, Chip.

1177
01:28:32,992 --> 01:28:35,153
Inside we feature Princess Yvette...

1178
01:28:35,394 --> 01:28:38,295
...the girl who picks up the handkerchief
with her teeth.

1179
01:28:38,364 --> 01:28:39,353
Ivy!

1180
01:28:40,032 --> 01:28:41,021
Gabey!

1181
01:28:42,368 --> 01:28:44,563
All right, step up. Step up, folks.

1182
01:28:47,039 --> 01:28:47,733
Ivy!

1183
01:28:47,807 --> 01:28:51,140
Keep away from me! Keep away from me!
Now you know everything.

1184
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:54,509
Here I am, Miss Turnstiles,
the famous celebrity.

1185
01:28:55,081 --> 01:28:56,981
This is my big society party.

1186
01:28:57,049 --> 01:28:59,313
Why are you here?
You're not in the blue book.

1187
01:28:59,385 --> 01:29:02,377
Why did you leave me?
I thought I'd never see you again!

1188
01:29:02,555 --> 01:29:05,422
I had to come to work. I work here.
That's what I do.

1189
01:29:05,491 --> 01:29:07,755
I'm a kootch dancer.
I have to work because...

1190
01:29:07,827 --> 01:29:11,422
...I owe Madame Dilyovska money
for my lessons, and I have to pay her.

1191
01:29:11,497 --> 01:29:13,431
Excuse me, I have to go on now.

1192
01:29:13,499 --> 01:29:17,265
Ivy, I don't care about any of that.
I don't care what you do.

1193
01:29:17,737 --> 01:29:20,763
All I care about is
that I've found you again.

1194
01:29:20,973 --> 01:29:24,773
Ivy, I thought I'd lost you forever.
Why did you run away?

1195
01:29:26,245 --> 01:29:30,079
Because I couldn't tell you about this.
I lied to you so much.

1196
01:29:30,783 --> 01:29:33,581
Did you think that would have made
any difference?

1197
01:29:33,953 --> 01:29:36,148
And Madame Dilyovska threatened...

1198
01:29:36,589 --> 01:29:39,820
...to write what I was doing
to my parents in Meadowville.

1199
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:41,319
Meadowville?

1200
01:29:43,296 --> 01:29:44,820
Meadowville, Indiana?

1201
01:29:45,565 --> 01:29:50,002
Yes, I'm from there, and I had Miss Hodges
for American history, too.

1202
01:29:51,304 --> 01:29:52,498
Holy smoke!

1203
01:29:53,072 --> 01:29:55,097
Did you hear? She's from Meadowville!

1204
01:29:55,174 --> 01:29:56,869
- No!
- That explains everything.

1205
01:30:01,247 --> 01:30:03,147
- The cops!
- Ivy. You're on.

1206
01:30:03,216 --> 01:30:06,242
- Where am I gonna hide?
- Where have I heard that before?

1207
01:30:13,459 --> 01:30:15,450
Come on. We'll comb the joint.

1208
01:30:41,854 --> 01:30:43,788
You girls see any sailors back here?

1209
01:30:43,856 --> 01:30:46,723
Sailors? Who'd notice a sailor
with you around?

1210
01:30:47,426 --> 01:30:49,986
- Hey, you're pretty cute.
- So are you.

1211
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:54,625
Get out there. Make with the wiggles.
We gotta sell some tickets.

1212
01:31:00,373 --> 01:31:03,001
Come on. Follow me.
Dance, dance, dance.

1213
01:31:13,352 --> 01:31:14,910
Come on. This way.

1214
01:31:18,190 --> 01:31:18,986
Sing.

1215
01:31:19,158 --> 01:31:21,649
"Pearl of the Persian Sea,

1216
01:31:23,930 --> 01:31:27,627

01:31:29,435 --> 01:31:33,303

"Pearl, pearl of ecstasy"

01:31:48,421 --> 01:31:49,649
Wait for me!

1221
01:32:33,299 --> 01:32:34,732
They're all yours.

1222
01:32:38,671 --> 01:32:42,801
I'm taking you girls to night court.
The rest of you stay here for questioning.

1223
01:32:42,875 --> 01:32:44,069
Where are the boys?

1224
01:32:44,143 --> 01:32:46,543
The Shore Patrol took 'em back to the ship.

1225
01:32:46,612 --> 01:32:49,046
- But they didn't do anything.
- You can't do that.

1226
01:32:49,115 --> 01:32:52,551
- We haven't even said goodbye to them.
- Little one, don't get upset.

1227
01:32:52,618 --> 01:32:55,917
Just a minute. We got a right to know
what the charges are.

1228
01:32:56,622 --> 01:32:59,318
- You want to know what the charges are?
- Yeah.

1229
01:32:59,992 --> 01:33:02,187
Well, first of all, speeding...

1230
01:33:02,928 --> 01:33:05,829
...stealing a taxicab, destroying a dinosaur.

1231
01:33:06,165 --> 01:33:08,827
In general, disturbing the peace
of our fair city.

1232
01:33:08,901 --> 01:33:11,734
For that, you separate three sailors
and their girls...

1233
01:33:11,804 --> 01:33:14,204
...without allowing them a goodbye kiss?

1234
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:18,470
For that, you throw three kids
on a one-day pass in the brig? Speeding.

1235
01:33:18,944 --> 01:33:21,538
Ivy, tell them why we were speeding.

1236
01:33:21,781 --> 01:33:24,648
Well, Gabey thought he'd never
see me again.

1237
01:33:24,717 --> 01:33:25,877
There, there.

1238
01:33:26,018 --> 01:33:27,576
And your dinosaur.

1239
01:33:27,787 --> 01:33:31,245
Why, Professor, you ought to feel proud
about that dinosaur.

1240
01:33:31,490 --> 01:33:35,153
You ought to feel proud that three sailors
from the United States Navy...

1241
01:33:35,227 --> 01:33:37,957
...got off the ship for one day,
and what did they do?

1242
01:33:38,030 --> 01:33:42,023
Were they thirsty for hard liquor? No.
They were thirsty for culture.

1243
01:33:42,201 --> 01:33:44,362
Were they running after girls? No.

1244
01:33:44,603 --> 01:33:47,663
They came running to the museum
to see your dinosaur.

1245
01:33:47,973 --> 01:33:51,704
For months out at sea they were dreaming
about your dinosaur.

1246
01:33:52,044 --> 01:33:56,208
Is it any wonder that seeing it face to face,
overcome by emotion...

1247
01:33:56,382 --> 01:33:59,215
...that one of them fell against it
and broke it a little?

1248
01:33:59,285 --> 01:34:01,981
I'll bet if that dinosaur could speak,
he'd say...

1249
01:34:02,054 --> 01:34:06,753
...what any public-spirited citizen would,
"For the Navy, anytime."

1250
01:34:08,627 --> 01:34:12,529
And the cab. We didn't steal it.
It was my last fare for the day.

1251
01:34:12,765 --> 01:34:17,702
And the biggest fare this cab company
has ever had: $287.50

1252
01:34:18,270 --> 01:34:21,262
And why did I keep this fare all day,
ladies and gentlemen?

1253
01:34:21,507 --> 01:34:24,567
Because I know my duty toward
the servicemen.

1254
01:34:27,513 --> 01:34:29,003
There was this one...

1255
01:34:29,248 --> 01:34:31,546
He was just a little fella.

1256
01:34:32,184 --> 01:34:36,712
A skinny, little runt. He kept pestering me
and following me around.

1257
01:34:37,223 --> 01:34:41,922
I couldn't shake him off. And, finally,
he kind of got under my skin.

1258
01:34:42,895 --> 01:34:44,590
You would have done the same.

1259
01:34:44,663 --> 01:34:48,861
He wanted to see the beautiful sights
of our beautiful city of New York.

1260
01:34:49,735 --> 01:34:51,430
And I showed him plenty.

1261
01:34:51,871 --> 01:34:55,568
And what do you think these boys
think now of our New York hospitality?

1262
01:34:55,641 --> 01:34:57,233
Where's our civic pride?

1263
01:34:57,309 --> 01:34:59,777
We should have hugged them
to our bosoms and said:

1264
01:34:59,845 --> 01:35:02,279
"Boys, the town is yours."

1265
01:35:08,354 --> 01:35:10,151
How about the speeding?

1266
01:35:10,222 --> 01:35:12,884
As a matter of fact,
they weren't doing much over 35.

1267
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:16,860
- They were crawling at a snail's pace.
- They were practically going backwards.

1268
01:35:18,864 --> 01:35:20,126
Just a minute.

1269
01:35:20,332 --> 01:35:24,792
Folks, it's 5:15,
and these kids have just got time enough...

1270
01:35:24,970 --> 01:35:28,599
...to get down to the ship
and say goodbye to the fellas.

1271
01:35:28,674 --> 01:35:32,303
Now, I want to see some action,
and I'm gonna start it.

1272
01:35:32,912 --> 01:35:34,004
Come on.

1273
01:35:38,551 --> 01:35:41,247
"Hooray for the Red, White and Blue

1274
01:35:41,587 --> 01:35:43,987
"Say hooray for the Red, White and Blue"

1275
01:35:52,031 --> 01:35:57,025
"I feel like I'm not out of bed yet

1276
01:36:14,486 --> 01:36:17,887
"The sun is warm

1277
01:36:18,791 --> 01:36:22,022
"But my blanket's warmer

1278
01:36:25,297 --> 01:36:26,696
"Sleep

1279
01:36:27,866 --> 01:36:32,860
"Sleep in your lady's arms"

1280
01:36:37,676 --> 01:36:38,938
Hey, come on!

1281
01:36:57,796 --> 01:37:00,196
- "New York, New York
- New York, New York

1282
01:37:00,266 --> 01:37:01,961
"New York, New York

1283
01:37:02,468 --> 01:37:04,834
"It's a wonderful town

1284
01:37:05,504 --> 01:37:07,768
"New York, New York's
A wonderful town..."
