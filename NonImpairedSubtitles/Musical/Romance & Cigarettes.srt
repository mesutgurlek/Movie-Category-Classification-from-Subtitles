1
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,680
When a woman bends over

2
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,760
a man sees a jelly doughnut.

3
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,160
Her brain expands. His explodes.

4
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,360
Dead on arrival
in her powdered jelly doughnut.

5
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,320
Dad.

6
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,440
Daddy?

7
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,800
# I can remember when we walked together

8
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,600
# Sharing a love I thought

9
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,960
# Would last forever

10
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,760
# Moonlight to show the way

11
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,360
# So we can follow

12
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,320
# Waiting inside her eyes

13
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,920
# Was my tomorrow

14
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,920
# Then something changed her mind

15
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,600
# Her kisses told me

16
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,800
# I had no loving arms

17
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,520
# To hold me

18
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,920
# Every day I wake up
then I start to break up

19
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,680
# Lonely is a man without love

20
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,800
# Every day I start out
then I cry my heart out

21
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,400
# Lonely is a man without love

22
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,120
# Every day I wake up
then I start to break up

23
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,240
# Knowing that it's cloudy above

24
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,200
# Every day I start out
then I cry my heart out

25
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,680
# Lonely is a man without love

26
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,280
# I cannot face this world
that's fallen down on me

27
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,640
# So, if you see my girl

28
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,000
# Please send her home to me

29
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,240
# Tell her about my heart... #

30
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,120
One, two. One, two. Okay, go.

31
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,560
# We are beautiful

32
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,120
# We are not ugly?

33
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,880
# We are angry? #

34
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,800
Hey, honey? I'm home?

35
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,640
Brought you some cookies.

36
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,760
Pignolia nuts.

37
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,200
What's the matter?

38
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,160
Somebody die?

39
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,880
"If God's gift of grace
or the light on your face...

40
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,680
...could make me forget your vagina is wet."

41
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,280
Let me see that.

42
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,640
"To Tula, my Tula, my red flower of love."

43
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,360
What are you, a private dick?

44
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,920
How different could it be, huh?
It's just a hole.

45
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,920
You can't incriminate a man
over some words.

46
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,440
What do you think you're
gonna find there? Peanuts?

47
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,640
It's poetry?

48
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,560
Po... Oh, it's poetry.

49
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,960
Well, I'm gonna give you
some fucking poetry.

50
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,040
Pink motels. White thighs. Deep fried.
Shake it, bake it, rotate it.

51
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,120
Swollen heads. Busted beds.
Empty lots. Dirty red twats.

52
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,880
- You just made that up?
- I'm deep.

53
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,160
A man is innocent till proven guilty.

54
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,880
I'm gonna lop your power helmet right off.

55
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,200
- Oh, you're gonna threaten me now?
- You whoremaster.

56
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,440
- You whoremaster. I smoked your ass out...
- No.

57
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,680
- ...you two-faced Judas!
- I am not a whoremaster!

58
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,600
My brothers, they're the whoremasters!
Not me!

59
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,680
Ever since you grew
that filthy little moustache!

60
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,960
I am not a whoremaster!

61
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,600
Preening in the mirror like Maria Callas!
Put the cologne all over my back, sweetie.

62
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,400
I cook you chicken, fish, no butter
low-cal this, low-cal that.

63
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,960
I trim your nose hairs, you fuck!

64
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,120
I swear on my father's grave, okay?

65
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,480
Oh, another whoremaster!

66
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,600
What's going on, Mom?

67
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,520
Oh, your father went on a beaver diet!

68
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,720
- This is not normal.
- Grow up.

69
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,960
Only a giant among idiots would marry you.

70
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,240
It's all in your head!

71
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,600
- What?
- What's in her head?

72
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,120
He's shitting out of the cup!

73
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Will you listen to her?
Listen to your daughter.

74
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,800
Snatch hairs pasted on your lip!

75
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,160
You shut up!

76
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,760
It's between your mother and me!

77
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,520
Knock it off! That's not fucking nice!

78
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,920
It's not fucking nice.

79
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,160
Even Gogo hated you.

80
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,600
Who's Gogo?

81
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,360
I don't like animals.

82
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
I don't like cats. I don't like dogs.

83
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,800
I don't like birds. I don't like fish.

84
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,200
I'm like my mother. I don't like animals!

85
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,360
- Who is Gogo?
- Mommy's cat.

86
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,800
Every day you'll wake up alone.

87
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,800
You don't even like me anymore, do you?

88
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,520
I hate you with all the hate
that you can hate with!

89
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,280
Did you hear that?

90
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,320
Did you hear what your mother said to me?

91
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,120
Can you hate more than that?

92
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,560
If you can, then I hate you more than that.

93
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,240
Then go back to him!
Go back to your first love!

94
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,160
Go back to him! Go!

95
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,000
"I can remember when we walked together

96
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,400
"Sharing a love I thought would last forever."

97
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,240
I'd give anything if you'd
come back to me. Anything.

98
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,240
# I cannot face this world

99
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,640

100
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,440
# So, if you see my girl

101

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,840
# Say I can't stop myself

104
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,520

# Without love! #

125
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,800
What's the problem?

126
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,640
I'm a married man.

127
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,600
A domestic disturbance was reported, sir.

128
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,800
- Yeah, that's the problem.
- Name, sir?

129
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,240
Nick Murder.

130
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,560
- You ever been married?
- More than once, sir.

131
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,360
Yeah? What went wrong?

132
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,320
Everything, sir. Am now once again.
Third wife, sir.

133
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,400
No, no, no, one wife, that's all a man's
meant to have. One wife. It's enough.

134
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,240
Yes, sir.

135
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,520
What's with all the "sir" shit?

136
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,520
Military habit, sir.

137
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,360
Oh, yeah? What branch?

138
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,120
101 st Airborne, sir.

139
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,000
Navy. Sound off!

140
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,720
Rat shit. Bat shit. Dirty old twat.
Sixty-nine assholes tied in a knot.

141
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,640
Eat, bite, suck, fuck, nibble, gobble, chew.

142
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,400
I'm a fucking paratrooper!
Who the fuck are you? Sir!

143
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,640
- Marriage is combat, son.
- Yes, sir.

144
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
- And not clean combat.
- No, sir.

145
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,680
She's got her territory in there, I've got mine.

146
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,960
She's got her army back in there.
I'm out here alone.

147
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,520
There's no prayer in that animal.

148
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,040
- He's a selfish man, Ma.
- Something should be done about him.

149
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,680
Drink some water.

150
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,600
I live in fear when he's around.

151
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,080
I love you, Ma. I love you so much.

152
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,800
I love you so much with all my heart
and soul. I love you more than my real mom.

153
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,360
I mean, I love her, too
but I can't remember her, so...

154
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,280
Rara, come on, come on.

155
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,200
I love Baby, but she doesn't any spend time
with me anymore. She's changed.

156
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,400
Enough.

157
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,640
If the love ain't there
it's gonna come back, Ma.

158
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,040
Come on. Rara, give her some space.
Come here, come here.

159
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,800
Here. Come here.

160
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,480
What did he mean, "Go back to him? "
Go back to who?

161
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,080
There was someone else
in my life a long time ago.

162
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,840
A gentle man.

163
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,880
You were married to him?

164
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,400
Before the war.

165
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,680
He went off to fight far, far away.

166
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,040
I met your father then.

167
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,200
No, I saw her coming out of the loo
at her crazy sister's apartment.

168
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,240
She had this headful of wet hair
and was wearing

169
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,880
a soft, cream-coloured terry cloth robe.

170
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,840
So I asked her.
I need to borrow a piece of luggage.

171
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,560
- You shacking up?
- Ah, ain't nothing wrong with sex.

172
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,880
You have big ones, buster.

173
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,960
Yeah. Dinosaur balls.

174
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,880
I'm from Brooklyn.
Boys don't talk to girls like that in Brooklyn.

175
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,080
I felt a sharp pain, like death.

176
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,240
The girl with the kind eyes, I says.

177
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,720
That's the girl. The girl I will marry.

178
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,000
You rat bastard.

179
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,960
I know you're in there.

180
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,560
Where are you?

181
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,560
Lost in the void.

182
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,800
Help me!

183
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,480
Somebody help me!

184
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,560
God had to give me cataracts.

185
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,360
One day you'll be blind like me!
In the dark forever, like me!

186
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,640
"Oh, sunlight of no light

187
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,000
"Once you were mine

188
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,400
"Let me feel the pillars upon which this
house rests

189
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,360
"Oh, Lord God, remember me, I pray thee

190
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,440
"And strengthen me, I pray thee
only this once, oh, God

191
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,880
"that I may revenge myself upon the
Philistines for one of my two eyes."

192
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,760
Die, Samson!

193
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,480
"Let me die with the Philistines!"

194
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,240
Wait, I'm coming up. Wait!

195
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,880
I'm not the type of guy
who goes up to a woman

196
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,440
says, "You want to go out with me? "
and then takes his dick out.

197
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,440
That's not my style. I'm no beast.

198
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,440
What?

199
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,880
I'd like to fuck a woman tennis player.

200
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,760
You know, with the outfit on.
And a tennis ball stuck in her panties.

201
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,480
Know what I heard?
Tony Curtis almost lost his sex life.

202
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,520
Back in '44 he's on a Navy sub.

203
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,920
A winch falls off

204
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,800
hits him in the base of the spine. Right?

205
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,320
Tony was paralysed.

206
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,760
He was laying there, just, he was praying.

207
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,040
Tony started praying that his private
parts would not be dead.

208
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,760
And about a week later
he starts to feel a tingling.

209
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,320
Tony fucking Curtis.

210
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,240
What am I gonna do?

211
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,800
Oh, you've got it bad, Nick.

212
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,880
I told you. I warned you.

213
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,440
Chicks smell a boner 10 miles away.

214
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
I'd be better off a fag.

215
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,680
Those guys are in shape.
Randolph Scott was a fag.

216
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,920
Not Randolph Scott?

217
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,080
Yeah, him and Cary Grant.

218
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,600
Get out of here. Not in a million years.

219
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,200
The list is long.
There's a lot of great fags.

220
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,840
Coming up. All right?

221
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,400
And she's a redhead.

222
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,320
Au naturel?

223
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,560
The whole megillah.

224
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,640
It's rare. They feel more.
That's scientifically proven.

225
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,640
- What?
- You take a natural red versus a brunette.

226
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,320
Right? And you prod them both
with a jolt of electric shock, mild.

227
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,440
The carrot-top's gonna need
20% more anaesthesia.

228
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,600
To numb the pain?

229
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,920
Pain, pleasure, it's all nerve-related.
The point is, they feel more.

230
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,600
Nice as she is, red as her bush is
fuckable as she is

231
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,320
you gotta put the fire out, my friend.
Attend to it.

232
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,080
Stamp out that Benson & Hedges bitch
once and for all.

233
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,800
All right, you bitch in heat
you're going down!

234
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,440
Come down from there right now!

235
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,520
Oh, my God! She's hot!

236
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,920
- I might need some for...
- No, but you don't.

237
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,800
Get them when you really need them.

238
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,920
- Sometimes I need
- Take one.

239
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,440
- ...to have some in the house.
- Take one.

240
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,360
Choose one you're gonna keep.
Put the other ones back.

241
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,760
All right. One card. I'm gonna get a card.
I'm gonna choose one.

242
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,240
- Go ahead. Put the other ones back.
- How the hell are you?

243
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,080
- Grace.
- What's the matter?

244
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,800
I had diarrhoea yesterday, Grace.

245
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,200
I was in the bathroom when you knocked
on the door. Bad.

246
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,320
You've been wronged. I feel it.

247
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,320
You don't have to tell me anything.
I have never met one man who was faithful.

248
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,680
- You've only been with one man, Grace.
- Till death do us part.

249
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,160
Did you ever feel that you wanted to
squeeze a kitten until the head pops off?

250
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,760
All right, put this back. That's enough.

251
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,080
He was a beautiful man, my Chester.
A real Southern gentleman.

252
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,680
Quiet. Dark. Graceful.

253
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,240
I still love him with every fibre.

254
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,520
That was 20 years ago, Grace.

255
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,120
Look, don't touch!
Don't touch!

256
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,680
- You want to buy it or not? You buy it.
- I don't want to buy it. I just...

257
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,760
It's good. All this ones is good. Look at...
You can look as much as...

258
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,960
- He's the only man I've ever loved.
- He thought you were shoplifting, Ma.

259
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,720
- Don't touch!
- I can't help it.

260
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,520
- Tell him to stick his cards up his ass.
- You want me to say that?

261
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,880
I'm too weak to break the chains.

262
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,960
I don't feel so good.
I mean, I was up and now I'm down.

263
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,080
He's been married four times.
Four times, Gracie, since he left you.

264
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,560
Mickey Rooney was married eight times!

265
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,440
I don't care! I love Chester!

266
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,760
What a woman thinks she's doing
doesn't count for anything, Grace.

267
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,080
Oh, Kitty.

268
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,320
Okay, okay, that's enough now.

269
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,360
That's enough, that's enough.

270
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,560
When I see somebody hugging
it's make me sick.

271
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,960
I feel lonely. So lonely.

272
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,440
Don't make me cry. Please, go out!

273
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,840
# We are not ugly

274
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,920
# And we are not beautiful

275
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,160
# No, we are angry

276
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,760
- Rara, where's Mommy?
- Out.

277
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,240
Where?

278
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,840
# We are not pretty

279
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm not supposed to say nothing.
She told me not to tell you.

280
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,960
# No, we are angry

281
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,040
Church. She went to church.

282
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,360
She went to church?

283
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,760
# We are angry

284
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,600
Went to see God, huh?

285
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,000
God's everywhere.

286
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,160
Don't need to go to church to see him.

287
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,200
You're right, Dad. God is everywhere.

288
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,720
# I'm outta here #

289
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
All right, I'm hungry, let's eat.
What's for dinner?

290
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,320
We ate already.

291
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,920
- You ate?
- Pork chops.

292
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,760
Without me, your father?

293
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,280
Mommy didn't cook for you.

294
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,720
I had three pork chops

295
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,360
Your mother's down there lighting
candles and a man's here starving?

296
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,760
- ...and apple sauce.
- I paid for those pork chops!

297
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,040
Papa wants pork chops.

298
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,960
Medium rare.

299
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,120
Mama ain't...

300
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,120
Mama ain't cookin', bastin'

301
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,920
floppin' pork chops.

302
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,360
- Pork chops!
- Lamb chops!

303
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,200
- Lamb chops! Chops, chops.
- Loin chops!

304
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,440
# Barometer, parameter
# Ooh! Barometer, diameter

305
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,840
# Stuck his meat thermometer
and tested her barometer

306
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,160
# Papa pop a cork
Fuckin' the pork

307
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,880
# Papa ate out! Gonna take out!

308
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
# Take out! Ate out!
# Ate out!

309
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,640
# Take out!
# Take out! #

310
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,640
# How my heart does rejoice

311
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,240
# When I hear his sweet voice

312
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:51,200
# And the tempest to Him I do flee

313
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,120
# That to lean on his arm

314
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,400
# Safe, secure from all harm

315
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,680
# When He reached out his hand for me

316
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,920
# For me

317
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:11,280
# When my Saviour reached down for me

318
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,960
# For me

319
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,560
# When He reached down his hand for me

320
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,080
# For me

321
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,680
# I was lost and undone

322
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,440
# Without my God or his Son

323
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,440
# When He reached down his hand for me

324
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,640
# For
# For

325
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,200
# Me #

326
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,560
What have we here?
Return of the prodigal daughter?

327
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,320
Come!

328
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,400
Come on in.

329
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,520
# Never, ever gonna give you up #

330
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,560
"Can't get enough of your love, babe."

331
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,440
"I'm gonna love you
just a little bit more, Baby."

332
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,960
"I'll do for you anything you want me to."

333
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,640
"Let the music play."

334
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,840
"Your sweetness is my weakness."

335
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,920
You're the best kisser in the whole world
Fryburg.

336
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,320
I'm going to make out
with your whole family, Baby.

337
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,400
Do it, baby! Do it!

338
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,840
# Didn't I make you feel

339
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,920
# Like you were the only man?

340
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,760
# Didn't I give you everything
a woman possibly can?

341
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,920
# But with all the love I give you

342
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,640
# It's never enough

343
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,040
# I'm gonna show you, baby

344
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,520
# That a woman can be tough

345
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,040
# So come on, come on

346
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,080
# Come on, come on

347
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,360
# Take it

348
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,880
# Take another little piece
of my heart now, baby

349
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,880
# Break it

350
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,280
# Break another little bit
of my heart now, honey

351
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,880
# Have a

352
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,960
# Have another little piece
of my heart now, baby

353
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,560
# You know you've got it
if it makes you feel good #

354
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,800
Hello? Who's this?

355
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,720
Hey, baby, it's me.

356
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,640
Oh.

357
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,400
Hello.

358
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,360
Did you make love last night?

359
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,400
Love?

360
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,080
No.

361
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,600
So you've lost a night.

362
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,160
Oh, Nicky.

363
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,000
I want you to put your finger
up my asshole right now.

364
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,840
Tula.

365
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,280
My pussy's lonely, baby.

366
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,320
Yeah?

367
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,080
Kiss it, nasty man. Come on.

368
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,480
Yeah. Give me those balls that clang.

369
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,800
Don't talk like that, will you?

370
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
Well, you know what, Nicky? I can't talk.

371
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,960
I'm just getting fucked by a big, hard
young, circumcised cock.

372
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,920
What are you talking about?
Are you with somebody else?

373
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,440
You're not here.

374
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,080
What do you want me to do
sit around and touch myself?

375
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do. I do.

376
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,720
Let me put the radio on. All right.

377
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,560
All right.

378
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,840
All right, all right, go ahead.

379
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,920
# Come on, come on

380
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,040
So, I put my ass in your face
and move it up and down, up and down.

381
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,040
# Come on and take it

382
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,120
# Take an other little piece
of my heart now, baby #

383
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,320
Do you like it like that, Nicky, do ya?
I'm rubbing my pussy.

384
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,880
Are you getting really hard?
How is your foreskin? Is it still on, is it?

385
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,120
Show me your face, big boy!
Yeah, that's it, nasty man.

386
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,520
You know what to do.
You know all the tricks, don't you?

387
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,840
# You know you got it

388
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,000
# Take it #

389
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,240
It's tasty, isn't it?
Come on, lick the icing off me cupcakes.

390
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,560
I'm rubbing myself
really rubbing myself hard...

391
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:42,000
# If you're looking for trouble
You came to the right place

392
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,200
# If you're looking for trouble
Just look right in my face

393
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,320
# I was born standing up

394
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,200
# And talking back

395
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,920
# My daddy was a green-eyed mountain jack

396
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,400
# Because I'm evil #

397
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,440
Cousin Bo!

398
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,920
What's the trouble, Kitten?

399
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
"Breaking in a brand new broken heart?

400
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,440
"Lost that loving feeling?

401
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,920
"Three cigarettes in an ashtray? "

402
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,160
It's worse than any song could say.

403
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,600
If anyone could, the King would.
I know, I know the hurt.

404
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,760
Been there. Nick's been shacking?

405
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,120
Not now, Bo.

406
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,920
I'll lay him right out. Boom! Like that.

407
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,320
No one messes with my Special K.

408
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,680
All right, Baby.

409
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,680
Baby, you're the 50-foot woman.

410
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,480
You'd better not be getting hitched.

411
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,720
No! The dummy was just too short.

412
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,040
"Here's looking at you, kid."

413
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,840
I got my teeth fixed.

414
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,280
Good for you, Bo.

415
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,880
Are you circumcised?

416
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,080
What?

417
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,160
Are you circumcised?

418
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,440
Circularise?

419
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,600
No, circumcised!

420
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,520
My circulation's fine.

421
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,640
No. Are you circumcised? You know?

422
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,960
Does a man's calzone look better that way?

423
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,520
Is it more attractive to women with...

424
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,600
I'd like to fuck a woman
with a backside as big as the world.

425
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,480
Are you listening to me? I'm talking to you.

426
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,520
Well, who wants to know?

427
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,240
You cocksucker.
You should have been a scientist.

428
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,920
It's cleaner. It's cleaner without the foreskin.

429
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,280
Most guys in pornos, John Leslie
nobody better.

430
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,120
Yes. I would say, yes.

431
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,960
Are you circumcised?

432
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,960
Hell, no. That shit hurts.

433
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,440
Somebody cuts my dick
it better be for vengeance.

434
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,320
# One, two, three, uh!

435
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,440
# Hot pants!

436
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,280
# Hey, hot pants!

437
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,840
# Hot pants! Smokin'! Hot pants!

438
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,960
# Where it's at

439
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,360
# That's where it's at

440
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,520
# Baby, take your Fryburg

441
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,760
# Looks much better with time

442
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,880
I fucking love you!

443
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,720
- # My fever keeps growing
- I fucking love you!

444
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,480
# Girl, you're blowing my mind! #

445
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,880
We've got the address, no last name.
Find the love shack.

446
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,280
You got a weapon?

447
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,360
Maybe we should stop
get something bigger.

448
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,720
I don't need something bigger.

449
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,560
Yes.

450
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,440
Do you have
a decrease in libido?

451
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,640
Sure. Thank you.

452
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,880
Do you have a decrease in strength
and/or endurance?

453
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:59,040
Have you lost height?
Are your erections less strong?

454
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,880
Has your uncircumcised foreskin

455
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,280
ever resulted in an adverse reaction
from your partner?

456
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,240
Does the shape of your glans
cause you anxiety?

457
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,000
Are you concerned
about inadequate penile hygiene?

458
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,440
If you answered, "Yes, " to question one

459
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,480
Mr Murder, please.

460
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,640
...or at least three of the questions

461
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,920
you may be a candidate
for adult circumcision.

462
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,640
I heard you with Fryburg.
You make loud noises and I hear them.

463
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,960
You make loud noises?

464
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,560
Yeah. I want to make them, too.
I told my psychiatrist.

465
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,680
- What?
- What?

466
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,040
I had nothing else to tell him. So...

467
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,520
Fuck off, Fryburg.

468
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,880
I'm a fucking star.

469
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,360
Did he do his Richard Gere for you?
Jumping all around in his jockstrap?

470
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,480
Gere!

471
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,720
- Richard Gere, he's hot!
- Hot chocolate!

472
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,840
Chetty!

473
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,440
He's got an ass that yodels.

474
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,640
Call me!

475
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,120
Chetty, Junior! Chetty, Junior!

476
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,880
Good God! Chetty!

477
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,640
Mom. Fryburg, Ma!

478
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,040
Was für ein Name ist denn Fryburg?
Fryburg?

479
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,720
Chester the Molester.

480
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,920
You're just jealous.

481
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,840
Look, I know that you know that I know
that you want me, Connie-lingus.

482
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,720
Don't you talk to her like that, you animal!
I'll put your head in a pillory!

483
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,920
Your father called.

484
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,640
So?

485
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,800
He wants to come to your sister's house
for the holidays.

486
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,720
How am I going to face him?

487
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,640
Some day, somewhere, somehow

488
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,640
I am going to go up in one of those
metal cans and I am gonna fly away.

489
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,640
Far away.

490
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,880
Okay, this is the block.

491
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,800
That redheaded skank is going down.

492
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,850
# Someone I belong to

493
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,760
I've got your back.

494
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,480
# Doesn't belong to me

495
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,440
Men. They blow smoke up your ass

496
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,200
make you pregnant

497
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,240
then go hunt for new snapper.

498
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,920
# Someone who can be faithful

499
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:18,000
# Who knows that I have to be

500
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,380
# Why must I be alone?

501
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
# So

502
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,360
# Why can I

503
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,680
# On my own

504
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,560
# So

505
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,040
# Alone from night to night you find me

506
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,080
Is Tula here?

507
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,920
# Too weak

508
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,520
Does that bitch live here?

509
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,960
# To break the chains that bind me

510
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,920
No.

511
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,880
# I need no shackles

512
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,960
# To remind me

513
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,600
# I'm just a prisoner

514
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,000
# Of love

515
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,880
# For one command

516
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,600
# I stand and wait now

517
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,440
# For one who's master of my fate now

518
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,480
Yeah, baby.

519
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,360
# I can't escape

520
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,800
# For it's too late now

521
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,520
# I'm just a prisoner of love

522
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,640
# Just a prisoner of love

523
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:46,960
# Oh, I'm just a prisoner of love

524
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,400
# What's the good of my caring

525
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,520
Give it up.

526
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,080
# If someone is sharing

527
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,760
# Those arms

528
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,360
# With me

529
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,800
# Although he has another

530
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,360
# I can't have another

531
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,880
# 'Cause I'm

532
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,200
# I'm not free

533
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,880
# He is in my dreams

534
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,320
# Awake or sleeping

535
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,320
# Upon my knees

536
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,200
# To her I'm creeping

537
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,440
# His very life, my very life

538
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,120
# Is in his keeping

539
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:43,840
# Oh, I'm just a prisoner of love #

540
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,160
Thongs, half bras, full bras

541
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,800
g- strings, push-up bras, teddies
garter belts, crotchless panty hose.

542
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,880
Fuck bloomers. That's what I sell.

543
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,640
To rich, tan, bored housewives

544
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,440
who take the fat from their ass-cheeks
and inject it into their lips.

545
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,200
If you're gonna kiss someone's arse, then
you should know that's what you're kissing.

546
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,680
Personally, I think
kissing's sexier than shagging

547
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,760
but you're sucking on chicken fat there.

548
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,960
Not that their husbands mind.

549
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,120
You know, they're out buying
big homes, buying paintings

550
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,840
going to the fucking opera
taking one up the bum for the Queen

551
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,640
while the misses are out sticking their
fannies in my face.

552
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,960
Does my bum look big in this?
Can you see my cellulite?

553
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,240
What they need, these women
is a good old-fashioned horsefuck.

554
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,960
They can buy all the new panties they want
but they get stained, don't they?

555
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,760
Stained panties, part of life
no matter how hard you wipe.

556
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,200
I think you're dead sexy.

557
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,760
Not at first.

558
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,280
Then one day, I looked up and I saw you
working with your shirt off and your gut out.

559
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,360
"That's a man"
I said to myself.

560
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,360
A real man.

561
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,120
Someone to take me down the pub for a pint.

562
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,520
You're way too old for me
but I figure you only go round once in life.

563
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,640
I've got, what, 75 years
if I don't get hit by a bus?

564
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,360
I want to kiss you, big man.

565
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,640
I want to give you a big, sloppy, wet kiss.

566
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,200
You won't tell anyone, right?

567
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,880
Inch by inch

568
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,360
the elephant fucked the ant.

569
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,480
Ouch.

570
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,080
I'm qualified to satisfy you.

571
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,480
Don't worry, kid. We'll find the ho.

572
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,440
We've got to think like Kojak.
"Who loves you, baby? "

573
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,600
We'll smoke her redheaded ass out
then we'll let the music play.

574
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,480
What am I doing?
I don't know what I'm doing.

575
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,640
Who knows what anybody's doing?

576
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,240
Some people fear the Lord.

577
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,360
I fear women.

578
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,000
What really happened

579
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,240
between you and Roe?

580
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,960
Roe

581
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,200
was my first love.

582
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,760
I traced her name in cowshit.
She was "my first..."

583
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,960
"my last, my everything."

584
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,800
Was it, um, true, I mean, that you had...

585
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:30,960
What?

586
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,880
Um.

587
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,880
Trouble?

588
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,720
Only with Roe.

589
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,360
With other chicks

590
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,640
I'm Barry White.

591
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,520
I go to the meat market
I'm in and out like car service.

592
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,240
- Okay, okay.
- I don't mean to be crude, but it's the truth.

593
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,640
Maybe I knew her too well.

594
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,640
I don't know.

595
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,560
Is that why she left?

596
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,920
She met the Greek.

597
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,520
Come here.

598
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,560
Come up here.

599
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,560
# I saw the light on the night
that I passed by her window

600
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,240
# I saw the flickering shadows
of love on her blind

601
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,960
# She was my woman

602
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,360
Spank, spank!

603
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,120
# As she deceived me
I watched and went out of my mind

604
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,880
# My, my, my, Delilah

605
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,360
# Why, why, why, Delilah?

606
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,160
# I could see

607
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,000
# That girl was no good for me

608
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,200
# But I was lost like a slave
that no man could free

609
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,000
# At break of day when that man drove away
I was waiting

610
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,520
The Greek!

611
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,680
# I crossed the street to her house
and she opened the door

612
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,320
Roe!

613
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:21,920
Why?

614
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,040
# She stood there laughing

615
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,000
# I felt the knife in my hand
and she laughed no more

616
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,610
# My, my, my, Delilah

617
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,960
# Why, why, why, Delilah?

618
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,640
You stabbed me.

619
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,520
# So before

620
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,280
# They come to break down the door

621
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,200
# Forgive me, Delilah
I just couldn't take any more

622
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,880
# So before

623
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,400
# They come to break down the door

624
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,080
# Forgive me, Delilah, I just couldn't take

625
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,640
# Any more! #

626
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,760
Bo?

627
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,800
Roe?

628
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,760
Bo.

629
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,400
Loser.

630
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,400
# I know a guy who's tough but sweet

631
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,960
# He's so fine, he can't be beat

632
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,200
# He's got everything that I desire

633
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,800
# Sets the summer sun on fire

634
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,880
# I want candy

635
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,880
# I want candy #

636
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,560
Wait, whoa, whoa! What are you...
What is going on here?

637
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,880
What are you wear... That...

638
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,520
Oh, my God.
That's Mrs Lipshitz's daughter's dress.

639
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,960
What is she gonna say if she sees that?

640
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,960
She's gonna say that I look better
than her daughter Stacy in it.

641
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,160
That's what she's gonna say.

642
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,200
- Take it off.
- No.

643
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,600
- Right now. Take it off. Now!
- It's wasted on her. I'm not taking it off!

644
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,720
They're engaged.

645
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,080
You two must think
I'm the cucumber in the gardener's ass.

646
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,200
Your mother know about this, Chetty?

647
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,880
Yes, Chetty, does your mother know?

648
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,920
Fryburg does as Fryburg pleases.
Fryburg is a free man!

649
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,400
I don't care
if he calls himself Melvin the Moon Man

650
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,680
he's not marrying my daughter.

651
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,680
- You're not going to come to my wedding?
- I'm coming.

652
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,120
Your mother's not coming to the nuptials?

653
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,560
- Hold on.
- Ma, you want a hit?

654
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,360
If I died and was born again
no, I'm not coming.

655
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,840
I'm your daughter! Your baby daughter!

656
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,880
I'm in love, Ma.

657
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,960
Love is the vaguest word
in the human vocabulary.

658
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,920
- My head is full of Fryburg.
- It's terrible and beautiful.

659
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,760
- His lips fill my dreams.
- Empty glasses.

660
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,710
- My head is full of Fryburg.
- It's terrible and beautiful.

661
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,810
- His lips fill my dreams.
- Empty glasses.

662
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,460
- When I'm away from him...
- Senseless conversations.

663
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:24,410
- ...my thoughts are of him and only him.
- Cigarette ashes.

664
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:25,360
He's my first love.

665
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,810
Well, anybody can be in love.

666
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:29,560
- I've read romances...
- When you've seen your lover...

667
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,110
- ...puke his guts out...
- ...in prose and verse...

668
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:35,010
- ...grow a cyst on his ass...
- ...in different languages.

669
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:37,710
- ...crush you with his beer belly...
- So I must be...

670
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:40,760
- ...stink of cheese...
- I must be in love. I love Fryburg...

671
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,410
- ...reach in there and rip your heart out
- ...Mom...

672
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:47,210
...and leaves a big, empty hole
then and only then can you say, "I love him!"

673
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:48,260
Do you even love dad?

674
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:48,410
I loved him. He pulled down the shade.

675
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:50,490
Now I hate him.

676
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:55,050
Why did you guys even get married then?

677
00:47:58,610 --> 00:47:59,490
I...

678
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:01,570
I was lonely.

679
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:04,850
He was handsome.

680
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:12,970
Wild, crazy eyes, like an animal
peering out of a forest on fire.

681
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:17,210
You know, love doesn't...

682
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:24,650
Not everything is cured by love, huh?

683
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,410
Look, my life has been one hell of a mess

684
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:33,130
but you are one of the reasons
that I keep trying.

685
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:36,290
Rosebud's my heartache.

686
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,370
Get a life and then do love.

687
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,610
Don't throw your dreams
into the never-never.

688
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:50,890
Life doesn't give you second chances.

689
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:56,290
Come on, baby. Check it out! Check it out!

690
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:58,050
We're gonna work.

691
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:00,810
Hey, you asshole.

692
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:16,450
Tease me, tease me! Hammer me!
Slam me! Drill me!

693
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:18,490
You did it for me. For me!

694
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:21,410
Give me all of that helldog!
Pour it into my red-hot oven!

695
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:24,010
Ooh, yeah, does it feel different?
Oh, does it feel different?

696
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:26,010
Tease me! Love me! Don't stop!

697
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:29,010
Oh, it's so beautiful! Oh, yeah!
It's so beautiful!

698
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:34,170
Oh, yeah! I can't believe...
I can't believe you cut it off for me!

699
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:38,570
You kill me! Oh! Yeah! Yes! I love it!

700
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:41,570
Go on. Keep going, Nicky!
You know you can! You know you can!

701
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:43,890
You used to be an athlete, didn't you?
Yeah, I know you did.

702
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:47,570
That's it! Ooh, you filthy bugger!
Oh, keep going now. I love it! I love it!

703
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:53,370
Oh, God, yes! Oh, yeah! Like that.

704
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:59,050
It's lovely like that! Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

705
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:08,970
Give me
that fucking fairy dusting, Nick.

706
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:25,930
You know what?

707
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,210
Next time a flag rises

708
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:31,970
you can knock on me back door.

709
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:34,890
Marlon Brando style.

710
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:44,250
What do you mean, up... Up your stovepipe?

711
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:46,610
Yeah.

712
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:48,370
Sure.

713
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:49,770
Why not?

714
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,330
Open my safe.

715
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:58,410
This is great chicken.

716
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:01,090
I'd better stop eating it.
I'll blow up like a fucking whale.

717
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:04,090
You don't want a fat bird
for a girlfriend, do you?

718
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:07,810
God. You are one crude broad.

719
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:12,730
Is that what you think of me?

720
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:17,650
I'm not a thinker. No.

721
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,730
Do you think of me? Ever?

722
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,970
Tell me what you like about me.
And don't be fucking polite.

723
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,370
The nasty way you look at me.

724
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:38,730
Mmm-hmm.

725
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:44,410
The way you touch your hair and you twirl it.

726
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:47,770
Right.

727
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:52,250
Your soft, white basket

728
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:53,930
up in the air

729
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:57,930
staring at me like a third eyeball.

730
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:01,330
You're funny.

731
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:02,370
Your...

732
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:07,890
I don't know, just, you're...

733
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:11,810
Your red everything.

734
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,330
I really like you.

735
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:19,850
I like you, too.

736
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:25,290
What about our future?
What are we gonna do?

737
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:38,810
Just living till you die is hard work.

738
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:49,570
# Tell me your love is true

739
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:51,380
# Like I love you

740
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:10,850
# Too many times romantic words are
spoken

741
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:14,610
# Too many words of love are said in vain

742
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:18,730
# Too many times a foolish heart is broken

743
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:23,010
# And left with just a memory for a token

744
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:28,610
# How can I know that you
won't hurt me, too?

745
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:31,570
# Do you love me the way you kiss me?

746
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:34,690
# 'Cause you kiss me like you love me

747
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:36,730
# Do you mean everything you say

748
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:39,130
# And do you say everything you mean?

749
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:42,970
# Do you love me the way you hold me?

750
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:45,850
# 'Cause you hold me like you love me

751
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,290
# Is it only a lovely dream

752
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:51,810
# Or can I dream of a wedding day?

753
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:31,290
# Do you love me the way you hold me?

754
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:33,970
# 'Cause you hold me like you love me

755
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:38,970
# Is it only a lovely dream or can I dream

756
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:45,730
# Of a wedding day? #

757
00:54:58,890 --> 00:54:59,770
Tsk.

758
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,930
There's nothing so magical
as a woman's ass!

759
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:13,450
Give me hot broads in high heels
with asses that forgot to get old.

760
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:23,810
What is with men, huh?
They think they can whip their schlongs out

761
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:26,970
whenever they want just in broad daylight
for the whole world to see?

762
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:28,130
Give the guy a break.

763
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:30,290
- What?
- Man is a beast.

764
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:35,410
Take myself, for instance.
I see a young girl get up on a school bus

765
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:39,650
jeans riding low, showing a thong.

766
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:44,810
My first thought is
"I want to buzz your butt."

767
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:46,010
- Am I right?
- Uh-huh.

768
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:51,490
My second, "How could your mommy and
daddy allow you to go to school like that?"

769
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:53,050
You should be ashamed of yourself.

770
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:56,650
I am, but it doesn't last. Blah blah blah.

771
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:57,810
Do you know where we're going?

772
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:01,010
Ring-a-ding-ding. All right, $1.69, plus tax.

773
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:02,210
Where?

774
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:05,770
Round two
Baby Mazoa against Spice Wallah.

775
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:07,970
Baby looks a little bit out of shape, there.

776
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:10,850
Come on!

777
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:14,010
These guys today, they can't fight!

778
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,410
- Daddy.
- What?

779
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:16,490
I've got to talk to you.

780
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:17,650
I'm in the flesh.

781
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:19,890
Yeah, but it's something that's really
really important...

782
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:21,810
In the kidney, hit him in the kidney!

783
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:23,970
- 'Cause I've been wrestling...
- Have some liquorice.

784
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:25,010
No, thank you.

785
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:26,290
Where's your mother?

786
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:27,490
Mother?

787
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:31,690
That's it! Hit him in the stomach!
In the stomach! In the stomach! Yeah!

788
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:34,690
- Dad?
- Yeah.

789
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:37,610
I'm going into wedlock.

790
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:49,330
So what did your mother say?

791
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:53,410
She says I can't...

792
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:58,930
She says I can't marry no one. I'm...

793
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:02,050
I'm too young.

794
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:05,450
So she's against it.

795
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:08,410
Right.

796
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:13,330
And so am I.

797
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:15,970
What?

798
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:19,850
You guys don't even
talk to one another anymore.

799
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:21,930
Well, I don't have to talk to your mother
to agree with her.

800
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:23,330
That doesn't make any sense.

801
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:30,490
There's a lot of things in this pothole
of a life that don't make sense.

802
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,170
But you do them.

803
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:35,810
It takes me a good, solid hour
plus coffee and a cigarette

804
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:39,010
to evacuate in the morning.
Does that make sense? No.

805
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:44,250
But I do it, because when I'm high up
on that bridge, I don't have a choice.

806
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:48,730
Okay.

807
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,970
Don't overreact.
Let me finish what I'm saying.

808
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:17,690
What do you mean
we don't know each other enough?

809
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:19,170
- I've known you since you were born.
- I know that we...

810
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:22,730
I know. But we don't know each other like
we're getting to know each other right now

811
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:24,690
and I don't want to hop in right now.
I want to date...

812
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:27,250
Let me tell you something, Baby.
It's all or nothing with Fryburg, okay?

813
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:28,330
All or nothing!

814
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:30,650
You take all of me
or you take none of me. I live right there.

815
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:33,330
How am I gonna show my face in this
neighbourhood if you don't marry me now?

816
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:35,250
Don't say that right now. Let's just...
We love each other...

817
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,570
What do you want me to do? You want me
to change? Fryburg can't change.

818
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:39,930
Fryburg stays like this.

819
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:41,730
- You fell in love with this.
- Don't take that away from me.

820
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:44,650
That's it! And you know what?
You're not in my band anymore.

821
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:45,810
Oh, God.

822
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:47,050
That's not what this is about...

823
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:48,130
You're not in my band anymore!

824
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:50,370
- Oh, God.
- Get back here

825
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:51,730
and let's finish the conversation...

826
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:52,930
- I loved you!
- ...Iike mature adults!

827
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:54,770
No not loved. Get back here!

828
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,210
Hello.

829
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:12,850
Can I help?

830
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:14,610
Twat did you say?

831
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:16,370
Do you need help?

832
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:19,050
Cunt hear you. Scum a little closer.

833
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:21,490
What did you say?

834
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:28,010
What kind of underwear
do you think a man fancies?

835
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,450
- Depends on the man.
- A man with a moustache.

836
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:34,330
What sort of moustache?

837
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:35,410
A dirty one.

838
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:38,250
Dirty black one?

839
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:41,770
Yeah. You hit the nail on the head.

840
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:44,290
I like doing that.

841
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:49,570
I'm in the market for some underwear.
The, uh

842
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:54,250
kind of underwear
that makes a man lose his mind.

843
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:58,010
Okay, well, I can help you with that.

844
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:04,130
You know, a long time ago

845
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:07,930
women didn't wear underwear
if they were well-bred.

846
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:10,930
Only prostitutes wore panties.

847
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:15,810
Right. I didn't know that.

848
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:21,130
Well, now you know.

849
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:26,890
Right. Do you want to follow me?

850
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:32,210
Oh, God, I'm dying!

851
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:33,370
No, you're not, sir.

852
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:34,890
I'm dying! I'm dying!

853
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:36,130
Where is the pain, sir?

854
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:38,170
Stomach! It's his stomach.

855
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:41,650
What did you eat, sir?
What was the last thing that you ate?

856
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:47,770
You said you were gonna leave some
for me. That was a four-pound tub!

857
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:48,850
You ate the whole tub?

858
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:52,370
How you doing, Mr Murder?

859
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:57,650
How you doing? How's married life?

860
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:00,330
Better, sir. Much better.
Thanks for your words of wisdom.

861
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:01,930
- He tried to kill his self.
- With what?

862
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:03,210
Black Liquorice.

863
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:06,650
You tell your mother I apologise.
You tell her

864
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:11,490
men are seaweed. Women are oak trees.

865
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:13,690
Amen. Men die young.

866
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:18,290
They think they ladies' men, 24l7.
Attila of the Springs and shit.

867
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:21,290
Lips raw with love and then they be dead.

868
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:25,250
You tell your mother I'm truly sorry.

869
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:29,330
I know your tragedy.

870
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:30,370
What tragedy?

871
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:32,170
You got a loose one.

872
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:34,530
Loose what?

873
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:35,650
Pussy.

874
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:38,410
Fuck you! What did you say?

875
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:39,890
Wide fucking shores.

876
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:42,770
You calling me used goods?
Who the fuck are you?

877
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:45,410
Second-hand love doesn't work for me,
bitch.

878
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:46,570
Don't worry, love.

879
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:49,930
I lose interest in a man
as soon as he begins to care for me.

880
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:52,050
I'm gonna rip your can wide open!

881
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:02,570
# Hee, hee, hee

882
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:04,170
Stop it!

883
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:06,250
I'll kill you!

884
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:10,170
# Hee, hee, hee

885
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:12,930
Get your fingers off me
you stupid cow!

886
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:14,850
Kick that big, red butt.

887
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:17,490
Why you try to kill yourself, sir?

888
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:22,250
# Well brunettes are fine, man
And blondes are fun

889
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:25,650
# But when it comes to getting
a dirty job done

890
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:27,970
# I'll take a redheaded woman

891
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:31,570
# A redheaded woman

892
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:37,370
# It takes a redheaded woman
To get a dirty job done

893
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:39,290
I'm going to break your face!

894
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:43,370
# Well, listen up, stud
your life's been wasted

895
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:47,050
# Till you've got down on your knees
and tasted

896
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:49,210
# A redheaded woman

897
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:52,610
# A redheaded woman

898
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:56,410
# It takes a redheaded woman

899
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:58,530
# Get a dirty job done

900
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:00,970
The one in the middle's mine
she looks dirty!

901
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:04,610
# Well, I don't know how many girls
you've dated, man

902
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:08,010
# But you ain't lived till you've had
your tires rotated

903
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:10,330
# By a redheaded woman

904
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:13,410
# Redheaded woman

905
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:14,410
Ow!

906
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:19,250
# It takes a redheaded woman
get a dirty job done #

907
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,010
Well, she done
made that man sick.

908
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:27,130
It's no picnic being a guy.

909
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:29,650
Right? It's hard.

910
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:34,690
I mean, If I was a woman
I would have been a prostitute.

911
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:40,290
I broke up with Wanda.
Her ass was a travesty.

912
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:43,530
There's just some things you can't overlook.

913
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:48,890
What is going on out there?

914
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:53,890
Get him, get him!

915
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:00,890
Well, I'd run too, if I was gonna be a steak.

916
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:06,650
Oh.

917
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:10,410
Mrs Murder. Nice to see you. How are you?

918
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:13,090
Every breath is a victory.

919
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:14,850
Hiya, Mom.

920
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:17,370
Don't you, "Hi, Mom" me.

921
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:24,170
I told you. I told you!

922
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:30,450
In the sixth grade, I told you
"Never tell a woman your business."

923
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:34,090
"You just do your thing
and you keep it to yourself!"

924
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:38,530
Maybe I should go.

925
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:39,890
Sit down!

926
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:51,210
I've got one foot on the banana peel
and one foot in the grave.

927
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:53,850
And you do this to me?

928
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:59,170
You have got dinosaur balls, buster.

929
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:02,890
I should have clopped them off
when you were a kid.

930
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:06,050
I'm your son, Ma! I could use some help.

931
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:08,570
Does it look like I'm wearing
a white uniform?

932
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:10,530
I'm supposed to be number one.

933
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:14,090
You overshot your boundaries, number one!

934
01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:17,530
You go and get yourself a mistress
and on top of that

935
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:19,690
you got yourself circumcised!

936
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:23,050
Jesus! We're not even Jewish!

937
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:24,290
I told him not to do it.

938
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:27,010
Shut up! Who asked you?

939
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:32,010
You're just like your father. And your
grandfather. May they rest in peace.

940
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:38,690
Oh, yeah.

941
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:44,690
Nicholas Nicotine.

942
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:49,490
Wolf lungs. The doctor says
he's got wolf lungs. They're all black.

943
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:55,450
Did I tell you his grandfather
tried to have sex with me?

944
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:58,010
Really?

945
01:05:58,010 --> 01:05:59,050
I'm telling you.

946
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:02,730
Told me my husband was a boy.

947
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:06,370
That he could do things to me
that I couldn't imagine.

948
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:08,770
Sexually?

949
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:13,010
Well, yeah, sure.
He wasn't talking about going to Jersey.

950
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:15,570
Jersey.

951
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:21,010
That man, my father-in-law
had more ass than the seat on a toilet.

952
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:25,290
Once he had an affair
with his architect's wife.

953
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:30,930
He had them over to the house.
Right in front of his wife, he said to me

954
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:33,130
"You take care of him
and I'll take care of her."

955
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:36,970
Like I was his whore!

956
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:39,730
You can't do that nowadays.

957
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:42,090
His own daughter-in-law.

958
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:44,330
He was dancing with her.

959
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:46,890
He was a good dancer.

960
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:49,570
And the woman

961
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:52,130
Mrs Thompson was her name

962
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:53,850
she had no bloomers on.

963
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:56,290
I seen it when he twirled her.

964
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:01,010
My mother-in-law was in the kitchen
pulling her hair out.

965
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:08,010
And now this bastard goes and does
the same thing.

966
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:11,010
It's in the genes. He can't help it.

967
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:14,890
That long ago dance.

968
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:17,450
I'm telling you

969
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:20,210
I don't think I'm over it yet.

970
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:25,370
Three generations of whoremasters.

971
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:31,370
Ever been on a plane?

972
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:33,610
No. Never.

973
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:37,330
Someday.

974
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:39,810
Yeah. Someday.

975
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:43,170
- Look, Tula...
- Nicky?

976
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:49,330
You shaved your moustache.

977
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:50,970
Yeah, yeah. It's gone.

978
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:53,850
Forever?

979
01:07:58,490 --> 01:07:59,650
You know, I could never...

980
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:03,330
I can never find the right words to say
what I'm trying to say.

981
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:06,530
Then don't say anything.

982
01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:11,290
We gotta stop.

983
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:12,690
No. No, it doesn't.

984
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:15,010
- Yeah. We're through. It's over.
- No!

985
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:19,610
Come on. We deserve each other.

986
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:21,890
Huh. You may be right about that, but...

987
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:23,970
I am! You were meant for me.

988
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:28,010
Look, I almost love you.

989
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:32,770
"Killing me softly."

990
01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:35,770
I gotta go home.

991
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:36,970
Home?

992
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:40,210
Where is home?

993
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:46,890
A place where a girl with kind eyes
named Kitty lives.

994
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:51,890
I love my wife.

995
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:53,010
Yeah.

996
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:54,570
She's not gonna take you back.

997
01:08:54,570 --> 01:08:55,770
Yeah, we'll see. I...

998
01:08:57,450 --> 01:08:58,690
You fit into me.

999
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:01,930
You know.

1000
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:04,490
But I gotta change.

1001
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:08,130
I'm a slow learner, but I'm gonna change.

1002
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:11,490
You wouldn't be able to say that
if I was licking your balls.

1003
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:14,930
It'd be hard.

1004
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:18,050
Yeah, it'd be hard. It'd be rock hard.

1005
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:20,450
Yeah, look, there's more to life
than that, Tula. Okay.

1006
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:21,730
I let you in.

1007
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:27,050
I let you open my apple like a fucking flower
in the fucking rain, you fuck!

1008
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,170
There's more to life than a hard on, okay?

1009
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:32,810
No, there's not! It starts there, doesn't it?

1010
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:34,330
That's where life starts.

1011
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:36,330
- Let me suck you before you leave me.
- No.

1012
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:37,530
- Go on.
- No.

1013
01:09:37,530 --> 01:09:38,610
No!

1014
01:09:56,810 --> 01:10:00,010
# Under here

1015
01:10:01,290 --> 01:10:04,610
# You just take my breath away

1016
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:07,690
# Under here

1017
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:11,690
# The water flows over my head

1018
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:13,730
# I can hear

1019
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:17,530
# The little fishes

1020
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:21,410
# Under here whispering

1021
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:24,650
# Your most terrible name

1022
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:26,930
# Under here

1023
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:31,010
# They've given me starfish for eyes

1024
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:34,170
# And your head

1025
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:35,270
# Is a big red balloon

1026
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:44,970
# Under here your huge hand
is heavy on my chest

1027
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:48,010
# And under here, sir

1028
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:51,170
# Your lovely voice retreats

1029
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:54,010
# And yes

1030
01:10:54,010 --> 01:10:55,260
# You take my breath away

1031
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:42,490
# And I glow

1032
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:46,810
# With the greatness

1033
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:48,550
# Of my hate for you #

1034
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:31,050
Kitty, I...

1035
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:32,330
- Stay away from me.
- Please.

1036
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:33,930
- I'm not talking to you.
- I'm your husband.

1037
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:36,370
I know that, you're the one that forgot it.

1038
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:37,610
Can't you forgive?

1039
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:38,890
The die is cast.

1040
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:40,010
From the bottom of my heart...

1041
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:41,610
You made your bed. Go lie in it

1042
01:12:41,610 --> 01:12:43,330
- I apologise.
- ...with your slut!

1043
01:12:43,330 --> 01:12:44,570
I know I lied to you.

1044
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:45,810
Point blank.

1045
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:48,610
Can't you give me one more chance?
Please!

1046
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:51,210
I'll do anything. Anything.
I'll give you anything.

1047
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:55,330
I love you.

1048
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:58,730
Maybe I don't know how to show it
like they do in the movies or in books

1049
01:12:58,730 --> 01:13:00,970
but I love. I have love to give!

1050
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:09,690
I don't want your tired gestures of love.

1051
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:25,250
# This is a man's world

1052
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:30,730
# This is a man's world

1053
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:38,290
# But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing

1054
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:42,530
# Without a woman or a girl

1055
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:49,490
# You see

1056
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:51,050
Oh, my God, a dog!

1057
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:52,850
# Man made the train

1058
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:57,610
# To carry the heavy load

1059
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:01,890
# Man made the electric light

1060
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:05,490
# To take us out of the dark

1061
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:10,770
# Man made the boat for the water

1062
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:14,170
# Like Noah made the Ark

1063
01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:19,170
# This is a man's, man's, man's world

1064
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:22,530
# But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing

1065
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:25,210
# Without a woman or a girl

1066
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:34,810
# He's lost in the wilderness

1067
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:39,530
# He's lost

1068
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:44,050
# In bitterness #

1069
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:57,970
# I tell myself what's done is done

1070
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:02,210
# I tell myself don't be a fool

1071
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:26,690
Whoa, whoa, mister, hey!
What do you think you're doing?

1072
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:28,610
Shovelling.

1073
01:15:29,370 --> 01:15:31,330
Not in my yard. Hey!

1074
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:33,250
What are we, peeping Toms?

1075
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,570
Buddy, you don't have to put this here...

1076
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:39,530
This is my boyfriend! My boyfriend!
My one and only!

1077
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:42,370
He's the Fruitman. I know who he is.
He works at the Big R.

1078
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:45,170
You got one beautiful pair of little
hills there, lady.

1079
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:48,530
- What?
- I watch you like dessert.

1080
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:52,370
Bending over in them tight little clamdiggers.

1081
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:55,650
Feeling the tomatoes. Squeezing them.

1082
01:15:56,890 --> 01:16:00,730
Full moons. Grand, wide open cans.

1083
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:05,250
Oh, woman's ass!
Roundly defeating man's in every class!

1084
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:06,730
Frances, that's enough!

1085
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:08,010
- Shut up, Ma!
- Don't you talk to me...

1086
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:12,610
You didn't want me to have a boyfriend!
You never did! You want them all to yourself!

1087
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:14,330
The Fruitman's here to stay, Mommy!

1088
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:15,490
- Don't you talk that way to me!
- Hey!

1089
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:17,450
What the hell's going on out here?

1090
01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:21,170
Die, you bastard!
Go on, throw it in his fucking face!

1091
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,290
You just twisted the cap off the tube, buddy.

1092
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:37,290
When's the last time you and your wife
had sex?

1093
01:16:37,290 --> 01:16:39,050
She hasn't been fucked in over a year!

1094
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:41,250
- Tobacco Road!
- Come on, kumquat!

1095
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,850
Fruitman, in the street!

1096
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:45,530
- In the street! In the street!
- In the street!

1097
01:16:45,530 --> 01:16:49,170
Wait, wait, wait! Hey, what are you doing?
What do you think you're doing?

1098
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:53,970
She speaks to me.

1099
01:16:59,450 --> 01:17:01,210
Over here, Magoo!

1100
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:02,610
Come on. Come on. Time for school!

1101
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:03,610
- Come on!
- Ding dong, baby!

1102
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:06,290
What's the matter, can't you smell me?

1103
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:09,290
- Come here.
- Sad fuck! Come on, kill him! Murder him!

1104
01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:13,050
- Time for school, baby.
- Come on.

1105
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:15,970
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Come on!

1106
01:17:16,410 --> 01:17:17,490
Hit him!

1107
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:21,730
Get him! Murder him! Come on! Get him!
Get in there! Punch him!

1108
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:28,010
Come on, hurry up!

1109
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:29,530
Ow, you fuck!

1110
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:33,970
# It must be him, it must be him

1111
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:36,450
# Or I shall die #

1112
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:39,850
Get him! Come on! Kill him!
Punch him! Kill him!

1113
01:17:43,770 --> 01:17:47,610
Give me a slap! Come on!
Punch him, I wanna see some blood!

1114
01:17:47,610 --> 01:17:50,290
Show me you love me!
Dickhead, show me you fucking love me!

1115
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:52,170
Choke him! That's it!

1116
01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:55,250
Sweetheart! Watch out!

1117
01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:00,010
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1118
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:04,450
Fuck! She hit me with a fucking tree!

1119
01:18:04,450 --> 01:18:08,850
Fucking troublemaker!
I'll kill you with a Glamour Stretcher!

1120
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:15,370
Come on, you skinny thing.
Come on, you bastard.

1121
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:22,170
# It must be him, it must be him

1122
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:24,930
# Or I shall die #

1123
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:50,930
My name is Rosebud. I did not begin right.

1124
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:54,730
If I was ever well
it was before I can remember.

1125
01:18:56,130 --> 01:19:00,650
We're a crazy family
but there's love still here.

1126
01:19:02,690 --> 01:19:05,330
Our next door neighbours are mean people.

1127
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:09,010
Frances' mother was in a circus.
She was an acrobat.

1128
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:12,290
And she tried and tried to have a baby
and finally she had Frances

1129
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:18,010
a foul-mouthed, spoiled princess
who fell in love with The Fruitman

1130
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:20,930
who was born without a brain
and a pea for a heart.

1131
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:26,490
This is my statement of feelings.
Thank you very much.

1132
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:56,650
Rara, where are you going?

1133
01:20:06,650 --> 01:20:08,130
So how are you?

1134
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:11,170
Fine. You?

1135
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:17,530
My head hurts.

1136
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:34,010
"Will there be any stars
any stars in my crown"

1137
01:20:37,490 --> 01:20:39,530
"When the evening sun goes down?"

1138
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:45,210
"Will there be any stars in my crown?"

1139
01:20:58,770 --> 01:20:59,850
What can I say?

1140
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:02,970
There's nothing to say.

1141
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:13,010
Ethel Merman.

1142
01:21:20,770 --> 01:21:22,530
What about Ethel Merman?

1143
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:24,890
- I never liked Ethel Merman.
- Yeah?

1144
01:21:26,770 --> 01:21:32,010
When I took you to see her
she intruded on our aloneness

1145
01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:34,850
with that foghorn of a voice.

1146
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:36,970
There's lots of kinds of singers.

1147
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:38,970
- Ethel belted.
- Yeah.

1148
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:44,010
Didn't...
Didn't Ernest Borgnine give her a smack?

1149
01:21:44,010 --> 01:21:45,010
Yep. Yep.

1150
01:21:46,930 --> 01:21:50,610
Gave her the bloody end of the stick.
Marriage lasted a week.

1151
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:55,450
Well, you can't blame Ernie.

1152
01:21:56,530 --> 01:21:59,890
"You Can't Get A Man With A Gun"
would drive any man crazy.

1153
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:06,730
Ray Middleton, him I liked.

1154
01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:07,730
Hmm.

1155
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:24,410
# The girl that I marry would have to be

1156
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:28,970
# Soft and as pink as a nursery

1157
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:34,290
# The girl I call my own

1158
01:22:36,770 --> 01:22:39,450
# Would wear satin and laces

1159
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:42,490
# And smell like cologne #

1160
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:22,530
Dear Father, forgive me
for I have sinned. It's been...

1161
01:24:24,290 --> 01:24:27,730
twenty, thirty years since my last
confession.

1162
01:24:31,170 --> 01:24:32,890
Do you believe in God?

1163
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:36,690
I don't know. I'd like to.

1164
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:48,970
I'm a jealous, selfish man.

1165
01:24:51,810 --> 01:24:54,810
My wife, she never got her due, not from me.

1166
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:57,810
I loved her, but, but...

1167
01:25:00,650 --> 01:25:02,130
that's not enough.

1168
01:25:08,490 --> 01:25:09,570
Now the, uh

1169
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:14,690
smoke fairy's gonna make me disappear.

1170
01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:18,210
Puff by puff.

1171
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:22,690
My sweet little Princess Nicotine.

1172
01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:27,730
I'm going to die, Father.

1173
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:31,130
Like everybody does, even the rich people.

1174
01:25:36,530 --> 01:25:38,770
So I just thought
that maybe it was time to, uh

1175
01:25:41,690 --> 01:25:44,090
get a few things down on the record.

1176
01:26:01,130 --> 01:26:02,370
I'm Kitty's husband.

1177
01:26:05,130 --> 01:26:06,210
I know.

1178
01:26:13,650 --> 01:26:14,650
Two things.

1179
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:18,890
Two things a man should be able to do.

1180
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:22,210
Be romantic and smoke his brains out.

1181
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:26,490
I agree.

1182
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:46,290
# One

1183
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:51,090
# Thou shalt never love another

1184
01:26:51,530 --> 01:26:53,330
# Thou shalt never love another

1185
01:26:53,330 --> 01:26:54,490
# Two

1186
01:26:54,490 --> 01:26:58,690
# And stand by me all the while

1187
01:26:58,690 --> 01:27:01,250
# And stand by me all the while

1188
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:02,370
# Three

1189
01:27:02,370 --> 01:27:07,010
# Take happiness with the heartaches

1190
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:09,290
# Take happiness with the heartaches

1191
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:10,370
# Four

1192
01:27:10,370 --> 01:27:14,850
# And go through life wearing a smile

1193
01:27:14,850 --> 01:27:16,490
# And go through life wearing a smile

1194
01:27:16,490 --> 01:27:20,210
# Oh, how happy we will be

1195
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:23,050
# If we keep

1196
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:27,410
# The ten commandments of love

1197
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,490
# Of love

1198
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:34,570
# Five

1199
01:27:34,570 --> 01:27:38,850
# Thou should always have faith in me

1200
01:27:40,410 --> 01:27:42,210
# Thou should always have faith in me

1201
01:27:42,210 --> 01:27:46,290
# In everything I say and do #

1202
01:27:47,490 --> 01:27:49,530
- Can I sit down?
- Sure.

1203
01:27:58,130 --> 01:27:59,410
I really miss you.

1204
01:28:07,210 --> 01:28:08,650
I miss you, too.

1205
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:15,090
I wanted to ask you

1206
01:28:15,970 --> 01:28:18,970
if you could maybe...

1207
01:28:23,410 --> 01:28:26,810
I'll be there for you. I'll take care of you.
But I...

1208
01:28:27,330 --> 01:28:30,410
I can't, you know.

1209
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:31,850
Oh, no, no, no.

1210
01:28:33,570 --> 01:28:34,970
That's not what I'm asking you.

1211
01:28:37,490 --> 01:28:38,370
Oh.

1212
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:40,970
Sorry.

1213
01:28:40,970 --> 01:28:42,930
No, I'm sorry. I should've...

1214
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:46,490
- I mean, I want to.
- Well.

1215
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:48,490
I still have feelings.

1216
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:50,210
I should hope so.

1217
01:28:52,770 --> 01:28:55,130
What I wanted to ask you is

1218
01:28:57,290 --> 01:29:02,170
now that I'm not feeling so good
if maybe you could

1219
01:29:03,850 --> 01:29:05,010
once in a while

1220
01:29:07,690 --> 01:29:10,450
scare me or something.

1221
01:29:11,490 --> 01:29:14,850
You know, let me know I'm still alive.

1222
01:29:21,290 --> 01:29:22,330
Okay.

1223
01:29:22,330 --> 01:29:23,810
- You understand?
- I do.

1224
01:29:24,610 --> 01:29:25,490
Okay.

1225
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:35,210
Thank you.

1226
01:29:36,410 --> 01:29:37,810
You're welcome.

1227
01:31:32,770 --> 01:31:33,770
I love you.

1228
01:31:40,690 --> 01:31:42,170
I love you, too.

1229
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:46,690
Kiss me.

1230
01:32:02,810 --> 01:32:05,370
"I never knew the sky
could be so deep a blue

1231
01:32:06,930 --> 01:32:09,490
"Until I knew I could not grow old with you"

1232
01:32:20,090 --> 01:32:21,290
Hello.

1233
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:23,770
Yeah.

1234
01:32:24,970 --> 01:32:26,050
Yeah.

1235
01:32:28,770 --> 01:32:29,810
Yeah.

1236
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:53,570
# The girl
that I marry would have to be

1237

# Her nails will be polished and in her hair

01:35:19,770 --> 01:35:22,050
- # She'll wear a gardenia

# And I'll be there

# Didn't I make you feel

1250

# Like you were the only man?

1251
01:36:27,090 --> 01:36:31,490
# Didn't I give you everything
that a woman possibly can?

1252
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:38,690
# But with all the love I give you
it's never enough

1253
01:36:38,690 --> 01:36:40,890
# But I'm gonna show you, baby

1254
01:36:41,290 --> 01:36:44,010
# That a woman can be tough

1255
01:36:44,010 --> 01:36:47,490
# So come on, come on

1256
01:36:47,490 --> 01:36:51,050

I say it again

01:37:44,970 --> 01:37:47,770
# Come on, come on

1271
01:37:47,770 --> 01:37:48,850
# Take it

1272
01:37:48,850 --> 01:37:52,530
# Take another little piece
of my heart now, baby

1273
01:37:53,290 --> 01:37:54,450
# Break it

1274
01:37:54,450 --> 01:37:58,050
# Break another little bit
of my heart now, baby

1275
01:37:58,050 --> 01:37:59,690
# You can have a

1276
01:37:59,690 --> 01:38:04,450
# Have another little piece
of my heart now, baby

1277
01:38:04,450 --> 01:38:09,690
# You know you got it
if it makes you feel good

1278
01:38:11,450 --> 01:38:15,050
# Take another little piece
of my heart now, baby

1279
01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:16,850
# Break it

1280
01:38:16,850 --> 01:38:21,170
# Break another little piece
of my heart now, honey #

1281
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:38,410
# I wonder who's kissing him now

1282
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:48,370
# I wonder who's showing him how

1283
01:38:51,890 --> 01:38:55,130
# I wonder who's looking

1284
01:38:55,970 --> 01:38:57,770
# Into his eyes

1285
01:39:01,210 --> 01:39:05,370
# Breathing sighs

1286
01:39:06,090 --> 01:39:10,330
# Telling lies

1287
01:39:10,330 --> 01:39:15,050
# I wonder who's buying

1288
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:17,450
# The wine

1289
01:39:20,330 --> 01:39:26,930
# For lips that I used to call mine

1290
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:33,170
# And I wonder if he

1291
01:39:34,250 --> 01:39:39,370
# Ever tells her of me

1292
01:39:39,370 --> 01:39:41,610
# I wonder

1293
01:39:41,610 --> 01:39:47,330
# Who's kissing him now #

1294
01:39:49,570 --> 01:39:52,570
That's Rosebud.
Rosebud at Cabaret.

1295
01:39:54,330 --> 01:39:59,210
# I asked my love to take a walk

1296
01:40:00,370 --> 01:40:05,090
# Take a walk, just a little way

1297
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:08,650
# And as we walked along

1298
01:40:08,650 --> 01:40:15,610
# We talked of when would be
our wedding day

1299
01:40:16,210 --> 01:40:21,610
# And only say that you'll be mine

1300
01:40:21,610 --> 01:40:26,890
# And in no others' arms entwine

1301
01:40:27,490 --> 01:40:32,090
# Down beside where the waters flow

1302
01:40:32,530 --> 01:40:37,050
# Down by the banks of the Ohio

1303
01:40:38,010 --> 01:40:43,490
# I plunged a knife into her breast

1304
01:40:43,490 --> 01:40:48,930
# And told her she was going to rest

1305
01:40:48,930 --> 01:40:54,010
# She cried, "Oh, Willy, don't
you murder me"

1306
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:59,570
# "I'm not prepared for eternity"

1307
01:40:59,570 --> 01:41:04,690
# And only say that you'll be mine

1308
01:41:05,290 --> 01:41:10,410
# And in no others' arms entwined

1309
01:41:10,810 --> 01:41:15,570
# Down beside where the waters flow

1310
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:20,850
# Down by the banks of the Ohio

1311
01:41:21,210 --> 01:41:26,050
# And going home between
12:00 and 1:00

1312
01:41:26,370 --> 01:41:31,930
# I cried, "Oh Lord, what have I done?"

1313
01:41:31,930 --> 01:41:36,770
# I killed the girl I love, you see

1314
01:41:37,330 --> 01:41:39,690
# Because she would not marry me #
