1
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:41,755
Saturday, September 25th:

2
00:08:42,963 --> 00:08:46,694
Another heavenly day.

3
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:50,768
Yes.

4
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:55,137
It's always a heavenly day.

5
00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:58,171
Every day is perfect.

6
00:08:58,345 --> 00:09:00,472
Nothing but happiness.

7
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:04,041
Yes, happiness,
happiness, happiness.

8
00:09:04,218 --> 00:09:08,655
I have everything that any man
or angel could desire.

9
00:09:08,823 --> 00:09:14,022
Beautiful memories of the past.
Pictures, toys...

10
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:17,588
Toys.

11
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:21,225
Children play
with the dreams of tomorrow...

12
00:09:21,402 --> 00:09:25,361
...and old men play
with the memories of yesterday.

13
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,537
Broadway.

14
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:30,203
Broadway I can see it again.

15
00:09:30,377 --> 00:09:33,210
The Broadway of 1907.

16
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,371
The Broadway
that was waiting for me.

17
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:38,814
An innocent world
believing in a golden future.

18
00:09:38,986 --> 00:09:41,216
<i>Full of peace and laughter</i>
<i>and beautiful girls.</i>

19
00:09:43,357 --> 00:09:45,882
<i>And here's the theater</i>
<i>where my first</i> Follies <i>opened.</i>

20
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,723
<i>As I look at that theater now,</i>
<i>it's all mine forever.</i>

21
00:09:49,897 --> 00:09:53,389
<i>No taxes, no bills,</i>
<i>and no competitors.</i>

22
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:55,626
<i>There they are. My first public.</i>

23
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:58,870
<i>The high and mighty,</i>
<i>and the hoi polloi.</i>

24
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,337
<i>And here, they're all mine.</i>

25
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,372
<i>Eternal toys that never grow older.</i>

26
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:09,244
<i>Look at Mrs. Astor in her beautiful</i>
<i>carriage with her famous horse.</i>

27
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,941
<i>Much more famous</i>
<i>that night than Ziegfeld.</i>

28
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,384
<i>And didn't the horse know it.</i>

29
00:10:18,392 --> 00:10:21,555
<i>And Diamond Jim Brady</i>
<i>with no horse...</i>

30
00:10:21,729 --> 00:10:24,027
<i>... but what a filly inside the car.</i>

31
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:27,463
<i>There they are, an old New York</i>
<i>first-night audience...</i>

32
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,762
<i>... the judge and the jury.</i>
<i>"What have you got, Mr. Ziegfeld?</i>

33
00:10:30,938 --> 00:10:34,533
<i>Show us your magic, if you dare.</i>
<i>Make us dream, if you can.</i>

34
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,176
<i>What have you got, Mr. Ziegfeld?"</i>

35
00:10:43,617 --> 00:10:47,212
<i>Anna Held Hourglass Girls.</i>

36
00:11:17,818 --> 00:11:19,445
<i>Thank you, Mrs. Astor.</i>

37
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:22,451
<i>I can pretend all my great stars</i>
<i>never grew older...</i>

38
00:11:24,158 --> 00:11:27,525
<i>... are still dancing and singing</i>
<i>as they did years ago.</i>

39
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,787
<i>Marilyn Miller.</i>

40
00:11:37,204 --> 00:11:38,466
<i>Fanny Brice.</i>

41
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,301
<i>Look at me, oh, look at me</i>

42
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:44,603
<i>Ho, I'm an Indian</i>
<i>Aha, I'm an Indian</i>

43
00:11:44,778 --> 00:11:46,678
<i>Will Rogers.</i>

44
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:51,683
Well...

45
00:11:52,052 --> 00:11:54,885
What will I talk about?
I ain't got anything funny to say.

46
00:11:55,055 --> 00:11:57,990
- All I know is what I read in the paper.
<i>- Eddie Cantor.</i>

47
00:11:58,192 --> 00:12:01,559
<i>If you knew Susie</i>
<i>Like I know Susie</i>

48
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,663
<i>Oh, oh, oh, what a girl</i>

49
00:12:04,832 --> 00:12:08,233
<i>There's none so classy</i>
<i>As this fair lassie</i>

50
00:12:08,402 --> 00:12:11,565
<i>Oh, oh, holy Moses</i>
<i>What a chassis</i>

51
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,900
<i>We went riding</i>
<i>She didn't balk</i>

52
00:12:15,075 --> 00:12:18,067
<i>Back from Yonkers</i>
<i>I'm the one who had to walk</i>

53
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,544
<i>If you knew Susie</i>
<i>Like I know Susie</i>

54
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:25,411
<i>Oh, oh, what a girl</i>

55
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,122
<i>I can hear the applause as if</i>
<i>it hadn't disappeared into the past.</i>

56
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,352
<i>The New York night</i>
<i>still burns for me...</i>

57
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:37,497
<i>... with the names</i>
<i>I have branded into its sky.</i>

58
00:12:37,698 --> 00:12:41,725
<i>Great shows that were part</i>
<i>of the dreams of America.</i>

59
00:12:41,902 --> 00:12:45,099
<i>How many millions of people today</i>
<i>remember their courtships...</i>

60
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,399
<i>... their honeymoons,</i>
<i>their anniversaries...</i>

61
00:12:47,574 --> 00:12:51,772
<i>... their happiest moments</i>
<i>in terms of a Ziegfeld show?</i>

62
00:12:51,946 --> 00:12:56,110
<i>The world would never forget</i>
<i>the</i> Ziegfeld Follies.

63
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,387
Those were the good old days.

64
00:13:11,365 --> 00:13:13,697
And yet, I wonder.

65
00:13:13,867 --> 00:13:16,597
Are those days really over?

66
00:13:17,137 --> 00:13:22,268
Just because I moved up here
did the <i>Follies</i> have to die too?

67
00:13:22,443 --> 00:13:25,105
Couldn't there be a new <i>Follies</i>?

68
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:29,980
No, no, I suppose not.

69
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:35,417
After all, how could there be
a <i>Ziegfeld Follies</i> without Ziegfeld?

70
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:41,857
What I would give to be able
to put on one more <i>Follies</i>.

71
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:43,619
Yes.

72
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:47,059
So many personalities
down there to choose from.

73
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:52,672
Great personalities from my day,
and great ones that have come up since.

74
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,501
How would I open?

75
00:13:56,243 --> 00:13:58,108
Let's see.

76
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,571
I'd like a crayon and paper.

77
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,641
Thank you.

78
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:07,952
I think I'd open with a pink number.

79
00:14:08,122 --> 00:14:10,784
Yes, a beautiful pink number...

80
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,758
...with a beautiful
pink and white, blue-eyed girl.

81
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:18,955
Yes. And maybe to introduce
the whole thing...

82
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,192
Well, who would be better
than my old friend Fred Astaire?

83
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,668
A great star, Freddie.

84
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,636
I'd be taking no chances with him.

85
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:32,643
And I know Freddie would say
something very nice about me.

86
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:35,779
What can I say about Ziegfeld?

87
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:38,782
Well, I can only tell you
that as long as there's a dance...

88
00:14:38,952 --> 00:14:41,512
...a song, a musical show
and it's good...

89
00:14:41,688 --> 00:14:45,021
...somewhere around or in it
is Ziegfeld.

90
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:49,458
He never cared so much
about villains, plots, stories.

91
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,461
The <i>Follies</i> never had a story.

92
00:14:51,632 --> 00:14:54,829
The <i>Ziegfeld Follies</i> was itself
a story of an era.

93
00:14:55,002 --> 00:14:58,699
If it was gay, bright, beautiful...

94
00:14:58,872 --> 00:15:00,567
...that's how Ziggy wanted it.

95
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:03,175
And, oh, I almost forgot:

96
00:15:03,343 --> 00:15:04,970
The girls.

97
00:15:05,245 --> 00:15:08,373
Ziggy was a specialist
at glorifying girls.

98
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:11,814
That's one of the most important
things about the <i>Follies</i>, you know.

99
00:15:11,985 --> 00:15:13,316
So...

100
00:15:13,487 --> 00:15:16,820
<i>Here's to the beautiful ladies</i>

101
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,721
<i>Here's to those wonderful girls</i>

102
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:24,397
<i>Adeles and Mollys</i>
<i>Lucilles and Pollys</i>

103
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:28,661
<i>You'll find them all</i>
<i>In the</i> Ziegfeld Follies

104
00:15:28,836 --> 00:15:32,101
<i>Here's to the silks and the satins</i>

105
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:35,708
<i>Here's to the diamonds and pearls</i>

106
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:39,209
<i>This is the mixture</i>
<i>To start the picture</i>

107
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:43,475
<i>So bring on the beautiful girls</i>

108
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:02,694
<i>Here's to the silks and the satins</i>

109
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,306
<i>Here's to the diamonds and pearls</i>

110
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:10,136
<i>A sweet endeavor</i>
<i>A joy forever</i>

111
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,269
<i>So bring on the beautiful girls</i>

112
00:17:37,664 --> 00:17:44,661
<i>Here's to the beautiful ladies</i>

00:17:45,472 --> 00:17:52,344
<i>Here's to those wonderful girls</i>

118
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:23,008
<i>Here's to the diamonds and pearls</i>

119
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:26,270
<i>A joy forever</i>

120
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,776
<i>A sweet endeavor</i>

121
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:37,857
<i>To bring on the beautiful girls</i>

122

<i>This is the mixture</i>
<i>To start the picture</i>

123
00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:15,387
<i>So bring on the beautiful girls</i>

124
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:37,006
<i>All this yap-yap-yap</i>
<i>About glorifying dames</i>

125
00:20:37,177 --> 00:20:40,203
<i>Leaves me like a cold potato</i>

126
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,044
<i>I'd much rather be</i>
<i>With a handsome he</i>

127
00:20:45,218 --> 00:20:49,882
<i>Like Van Johnson</i>
<i>Who's a real tomato</i>

128
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:53,690
<i>For a date with Fred MacMurray</i>
<i>You can bet your life I'd hurry</i>

129
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,385
<i>And a guy like Mischa Auer</i>

130
00:20:56,563 --> 00:21:00,897
<i>Has me completely in his power</i>

131
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:04,901
<i>In fact most any man I've seen</i>

132
00:21:05,071 --> 00:21:10,373
<i>Is the only man for me</i>

133
00:21:12,546 --> 00:21:15,811
<i>Bring on those wonderful men</i>

134
00:21:16,082 --> 00:21:19,017
<i>Bring me an elegant guy</i>

135
00:21:19,186 --> 00:21:22,383
<i>A soldier or sailor</i>
<i>A Gable or Taylor</i>

136
00:21:22,556 --> 00:21:25,719
<i>A short or a tall one</i>
<i>I just wanna call one</i>

137
00:21:25,892 --> 00:21:29,225
<i>My own, private wonderful he</i>

138
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:32,263
<i>Bring what you can to me</i>

139
00:21:32,732 --> 00:21:35,064
<i>Bring me a guy to pin up</i>

140
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:38,698
<i>Bring me a prince on a horse</i>

141
00:21:39,272 --> 00:21:42,241
<i>A dark or a light one</i>
<i>I just want to sight one</i>

142
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:45,378
<i>Who'll call me his missis</i>
<i>And give with the kisses</i>

143
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:48,639
<i>I'm afraid I've a terrible yen</i>

144
00:21:48,882 --> 00:21:51,976
<i>For those wonderful M-E-N</i>

145
00:21:52,152 --> 00:21:55,315
<i>Amor, Amor</i>

146
00:21:55,489 --> 00:21:58,583
<i>There must be someone for me</i>
<i>But what's he waiting for?</i>

147
00:21:58,758 --> 00:22:01,488
<i>No hope, no soap</i>

148
00:22:01,995 --> 00:22:05,123
<i>If he don't appear</i>
<i>I fear I'm at the end of my rope</i>

149
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:08,597
<i>Oh, bring on a male who ain't frail</i>

150
00:22:09,302 --> 00:22:12,169
<i>Bring on a man from a cave</i>

151
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:15,500
<i>Someone to relax with</i>
<i>And pay income tax with</i>

152
00:22:15,675 --> 00:22:18,508
<i>And though he's from hunger</i>
<i>I'm not getting younger</i>

153
00:22:18,678 --> 00:22:21,647

<i>I'll get a man before I'm through</i>

...I would like Plaza 5-5597, please.

165

- Operator.
<i>- Number, please.</i>

174
00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:42,264
Operator, you got me
the wrong number.

175
00:27:42,435 --> 00:27:45,836
I wanted Plaza 5-5597,

Did you like that picture?
I liked it.

183
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:04,813
When the airplanes went over...

184
00:28:04,991 --> 00:28:06,856
A fellow had one leg.
Handsome, brave...

185

190

Now,
that's Louis Sebastian's cigar store.

199
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:02,878
It's right around the corner.
I could walk there.

200
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:05,244
I don't want the world

...and I don't know
Mr. Oogu's first name.

250
00:33:15,468 --> 00:33:19,905
All I know is Oogu.
Just plain Oogu.

Look, Oogu,
you won't remember me...

00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:33,942
...but we met
at a preview of <i>Dorian Gray</i>.

<i>- Sure, sure.</i>
- Yeah.

256
00:33:37,823 --> 00:33:40,417
Look, Oogu, I wonder
if you would do me a favor.

257
00:33:40,593 --> 00:33:44,620
<i>Sure, any friend</i>

Oh, I'm glad you feel that way.

259
00:33:48,634 --> 00:33:51,296
Look, Oogu...

260
00:33:51,704 --> 00:33:57,199
...would you get me Plaza 5-55...
<i>- Sorry, your three minutes are up.</i>

Keep moving.
Watch your step there.

263
00:37:47,706 --> 00:37:51,733
Step lively. Right this way, please.
Step lively. Keep moving.

264
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,716
- Hey, excuse me.
- Hey.

265
00:37:58,884 --> 00:38:00,579
I beg your pardon.

266
00:38:00,753 --> 00:38:05,452
Now, this property that we're gonna
look at is worth $ 190,000.

267
00:38:05,624 --> 00:38:07,888
He's asking 125.

268
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,392
We'll offer him...

269
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,894
...fifty-five...

270
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:16,590
We'll offer him 60
and settle for 75.

271
00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:19,101
Nothing doing.
Why don't you leave the bu...?

272
00:38:19,271 --> 00:38:21,535
- Well, really.
- I'm sorry. All right.

273
00:38:21,707 --> 00:38:24,608
Why don't you leave
the business things to me? I... I...

274
00:38:27,213 --> 00:38:30,444
Excuse me, little girl... Madam.

275
00:38:30,616 --> 00:38:34,382
Now, listen, I'll get it for 50,000.
I'll save you 25.

276
00:38:34,553 --> 00:38:38,455
Never mind.
If it's worth 150,000, I'll give him 75.

277
00:38:38,624 --> 00:38:42,060
No, $50,000. Now stop worrying
about it, will you? I'm your lawyer.

278
00:38:42,228 --> 00:38:44,389
You're my lawyer.
It'll be like the last deal.

279
00:38:44,597 --> 00:38:48,556
You were gonna save me 25,000
and I lost the whole deal.

280
00:38:48,734 --> 00:38:51,066
I could have made 200,000.

281
00:38:51,237 --> 00:38:53,398
You're my lawyer.

282
00:38:55,608 --> 00:38:58,475
- Hey, what's the matter?
- You're under arrest.

283
00:38:58,644 --> 00:39:01,078
- It ain't lit.
- I said you were under arrest.

284
00:39:01,247 --> 00:39:03,511
- What for?
- For expectorating in a subway.

285
00:39:03,682 --> 00:39:06,344
Now I gotta take you to court
and they'll fine you $2.

286
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:09,454
I didn't know what I was doing.

287
00:39:09,622 --> 00:39:12,090
Can't we settle this out of court?

288
00:39:12,258 --> 00:39:15,887
- I'll give you the 2 dollars.
- Okay.

289
00:39:17,162 --> 00:39:19,255
I've got it right here.

290
00:39:22,468 --> 00:39:25,130
I haven't got it on me.
He'll give you the 2 dollars.

291
00:39:25,304 --> 00:39:27,135
- Give him the 2 dollars.
- I will not.

292
00:39:27,306 --> 00:39:28,637
Have you got any witnesses?

293
00:39:28,807 --> 00:39:30,934
How do you know he expectorated
on the floor?

294
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:34,102
- I saw him with my own eyes.
- Stop arguing. What's 2 dollars?

295
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,874
Give him the 2 dollars.
If we ain't uptown by 8:00...

296
00:39:37,049 --> 00:39:39,779
...we'll lose the whole deal.
- You won't lose a thing.

297
00:39:39,952 --> 00:39:42,819
- I dare you to arrest my client.
- Oh, a smart guy, eh?

298
00:39:42,988 --> 00:39:44,683
Yes, I never lost a case in my life.

299
00:39:44,857 --> 00:39:46,984
Well, we'll see about that.
Come on with me.

300
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:50,686
- Pay him the 2 dollars.
- I'll break you for this, officer.

301
00:39:50,863 --> 00:39:52,797
Pay him the 2 dollars.

302
00:39:59,204 --> 00:40:03,573
The court finds the defendant guilty
of expectorating in the subway...

303
00:40:03,809 --> 00:40:07,973
...and hereby fines the defendant
two dollars, or 30 days in jail.

304
00:40:08,147 --> 00:40:10,741
- All right. Pay him the 2 dollars.
- Nothing doing.

305
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,315
We'll appeal.

306
00:40:12,484 --> 00:40:14,179
- Oh, pay the 2 dollars.
- No.

307
00:40:14,353 --> 00:40:16,446
You're a businessman
and you can't afford...

308
00:40:16,722 --> 00:40:18,849
...to have a black mark against you.

309
00:40:19,658 --> 00:40:22,422
- We'll take it to a higher court.
- Take him away.

310
00:40:22,595 --> 00:40:24,995
Oh, please. Pay the 2 dollars.

311
00:40:25,164 --> 00:40:28,725
Don't worry. I'll have you
out of here in 20 minutes.

312
00:40:34,707 --> 00:40:36,937
How long have you been in here?

313
00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:40,408
I'll bet you've got
the same lawyer I've got.

314
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,680
Hello, Victor, how are you?

315
00:40:47,853 --> 00:40:49,184
Where have you been?

316
00:40:49,355 --> 00:40:53,189
I've been waiting here 12 days
for you to get back in 20 minutes.

317
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,089
Oh, now, Victor,
don't be so impatient.

318
00:40:56,261 --> 00:40:58,525
I haven't much time.
I am in a bit of a hurry.

319
00:40:58,697 --> 00:41:01,564
But I couldn't help but drop by,
and give you the good news.

320
00:41:01,767 --> 00:41:04,395
Yes, the court has granted
our motion for an appeal.

321
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,595
Look, "Whereas my client,
Victor Moore...

322
00:41:06,772 --> 00:41:08,763
...here and after known
as the defendant...

323
00:41:08,941 --> 00:41:11,432
...is being sued
for committing a public nuisance"...

324
00:41:11,644 --> 00:41:14,636
Never mind that stuff.
Just pay them the 2 dollars.

325
00:41:14,813 --> 00:41:16,974
I will not.
I never lost a case in my life.

326
00:41:17,149 --> 00:41:19,447
Say, what are you trying to do?
Spoil my record?

327
00:41:19,618 --> 00:41:22,416
No. All I'm trying to do
is get out of jail.

328
00:41:22,588 --> 00:41:24,818
Won't you please pay them
the 2 dollars?

329
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,652
Nothing doing.
You're going to appeal.

330
00:41:27,826 --> 00:41:29,555
And by the way,
I want you to know...

331
00:41:29,728 --> 00:41:31,992
...that I kept the accounts
absolutely straight.

332
00:41:32,164 --> 00:41:35,292
- What do you mean, "accounts"?
- It takes money to file an appeal.

333
00:41:35,467 --> 00:41:37,992
- Well, pay the 2 dollars.
- No, no. It's too late.

334
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:40,832
I've already filed my briefs.
Now here are the accounts.

335
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,736
Never mind.
How much did you spend?

336
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:46,810
Well, three stenographers
for 10 days at 5 dollars a day.

337
00:41:46,979 --> 00:41:49,971
A hundred and fifty dollars.
That's for preparing the briefs.

338
00:41:50,149 --> 00:41:52,276
Now, $ 10 a day for taking
them to lunch.

339
00:41:52,451 --> 00:41:54,442
What do you mean
by taking stenographers...

340
00:41:54,653 --> 00:41:58,350
...out to lunch on my money?
- Don't tell me how to live my life.

341
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,855
Now then, $ 100 a day
for three assistants.

342
00:42:01,093 --> 00:42:03,926
- Five thousand to Walter Wilson.
- For what?

343
00:42:04,096 --> 00:42:06,360
- For an opinion.
- What did Wilson say?

344
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,362
He said, "Pay them the 2 dollars."

345
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,365
Five thousand dollars to Barker,
Barker, Barker and Barker.

346
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,095
- What did Barker, Barker, Barker and...?
- And Barker?

347
00:42:14,273 --> 00:42:16,468
- Barker. What did they say?
- "Pay them the $2."

348
00:42:16,642 --> 00:42:18,803
Five thousand
to Jerry Geisler for an opinion.

349
00:42:18,977 --> 00:42:21,172
- What did he say?
- He said, "Pay them the $2."

350
00:42:21,346 --> 00:42:23,337
Seems to be quite
a difference of opinion.

351
00:42:23,515 --> 00:42:25,039
Oh, wait. I'm not through yet.

352
00:42:25,217 --> 00:42:27,981
Now, there's $250
to my nephew for an opinion.

353
00:42:28,153 --> 00:42:30,348
A hundred and fifty
to my niece for an opinion.

354
00:42:30,522 --> 00:42:33,218
And $ 75 for my wife's opinion.

355
00:42:33,392 --> 00:42:36,020
What are you bringing them in for?
They're not lawyers.

356
00:42:36,195 --> 00:42:38,322
Well, everybody's entitled
to their opinion.

357
00:42:38,497 --> 00:42:40,897
Now comes my opinion: $3000.

358
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,501
Oh, but we're gonna win this case.
We got an ace in the hole.

359
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:47,662
- We got four witnesses.
- What? We ain't got no witnesses.

360
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,171
Oh, yes, we have.

361
00:42:49,341 --> 00:42:51,707
Two are coming from Chicago,
and two from Detroit.

362
00:42:51,877 --> 00:42:55,040
And that makes
the total expense to date...

363
00:42:55,214 --> 00:43:00,151
...$463,663.63.

364
00:43:00,419 --> 00:43:04,219
For goodness sake,
will you pay the 2 dollars.

365
00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:12,397
It is the opinion of this court...

366
00:43:12,564 --> 00:43:15,055
...that the decision
of the lower court be reversed.

367
00:43:15,234 --> 00:43:17,429
- Reversed. Didn't I tell you?
- Is that good?

368
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,228
Silence.

369
00:43:19,705 --> 00:43:22,572
As a result of the defendant's
behavior in the subway...

370
00:43:22,741 --> 00:43:24,766
...a deadly germ was spread...

371
00:43:24,943 --> 00:43:27,036
...which caused the death
of two citizens.

372
00:43:27,212 --> 00:43:31,615
We therefore find the defendant guilty
of murder in the first degree.

373
00:43:31,784 --> 00:43:34,014
And the defendant
is hereby sentenced...

374
00:43:34,186 --> 00:43:36,245
...to the punishment of death.

375
00:43:36,421 --> 00:43:38,252
Your Honor, we appeal.

376
00:43:38,457 --> 00:43:43,759
Pay them the 2 dollars.
Give them each 2 dollars.

377
00:43:59,778 --> 00:44:03,111
Victor, you have only
a few hours left to live.

378
00:44:03,282 --> 00:44:04,749
Nonsense.

379
00:44:04,917 --> 00:44:06,885
I've got this case all sewed up.

380
00:44:07,085 --> 00:44:08,746
You've got nothing to worry about.

381
00:44:08,921 --> 00:44:11,219
I had the governor
on the phone all afternoon...

382
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,415
...and the pardon will be here
any minute.

383
00:44:13,592 --> 00:44:15,423
What would you like
for dinner, Victor?

384
00:44:15,594 --> 00:44:19,257
This will be your last meal.
You can order anything you want.

385
00:44:19,998 --> 00:44:22,899
- I can have anything?
- Anything.

386
00:44:23,068 --> 00:44:24,968
- You take the order?
- Yes, sir.

387
00:44:25,137 --> 00:44:28,106
Well, I have an order of toast...

388
00:44:28,807 --> 00:44:33,642
...dry toast.
Not the thin Melba toast...

389
00:44:34,112 --> 00:44:35,636
...thicker.

390
00:44:35,814 --> 00:44:39,443
And a cup of cocoa...

391
00:44:40,352 --> 00:44:44,482
...and some stewed prunes
and cream.

392
00:44:44,756 --> 00:44:47,953
No. Better leave out the cream.

393
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,724
That's fattening.

394
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:54,465
Oh, come on, Victor, cheer up.
Have a cigar.

395
00:44:54,633 --> 00:44:57,932
Didn't I tell you the governor
would come through with a pardon?

396
00:44:58,103 --> 00:44:59,866
Arnold never lost a case.

397
00:45:00,105 --> 00:45:02,096
It's a good thing you had me
as a lawyer...

398
00:45:02,274 --> 00:45:04,674
...or you would have been
a dead pigeon, sure.

399
00:45:04,843 --> 00:45:06,606
You're a lucky man.

400
00:45:06,778 --> 00:45:10,714
Yeah. I'm a lucky man.
You ruined my business.

401
00:45:10,883 --> 00:45:14,444
You wrecked my health.
You spend all my money.

402
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:17,987
My wife left me
because I'm an ex-convict.

403
00:45:18,156 --> 00:45:20,181
My children are disgraced.

404
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:23,692
I'm a ruined man,
and all because of you.

405
00:45:23,862 --> 00:45:25,853
You're a lawyer.

406
00:45:30,002 --> 00:45:32,402
- You're under arrest.
- What, again? Hand it to him.

407
00:45:32,571 --> 00:45:35,972
- Don't worry, they can't do this.
- Please pay him the 2 dollars.

408
00:45:36,141 --> 00:45:38,803
- I'll have you out in 20 minutes.
- I wanted to pay them.

409
00:45:39,011 --> 00:45:42,071
Don't do a thing, Victor,
until you hear from me.

410
00:49:58,103 --> 00:50:03,268
<i>Maybe it was the music</i>
<i>Or the glamorous sky of blue</i>

411
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:07,276
<i>Maybe it was the mood I was in</i>

412
00:50:07,445 --> 00:50:13,975
<i>Or maybe it was really you</i>
<i>Really you</i>

413
00:50:17,956 --> 00:50:20,925
<i>This heart of mine</i>

414
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,654
<i>Was doing very well</i>

415
00:50:27,699 --> 00:50:30,930
<i>The world was fine</i>

416
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:35,799
<i>As far as I could tell</i>

417
00:50:36,675 --> 00:50:41,544
<i>And then quite suddenly I saw you</i>

418
00:50:41,713 --> 00:50:46,116
<i>And I dreamed of gay amours</i>

419
00:50:47,185 --> 00:50:50,313
<i>At dawn I'll wake up singing</i>

420
00:50:50,488 --> 00:50:54,720
<i>Sentimental overtures</i>

421

00:51:03,835 --> 00:51:07,293
<i>I taste the wine</i>

424
00:51:08,139 --> 00:51:12,166
<i>Of real romancing now</i>

425
00:51:12,978 --> 00:51:18,348
<i>Somehow this crazy world</i>
<i>Has taken on</i>

426
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:21,642
<i>A wonderful design</i>

427
00:51:22,354 --> 00:51:25,380
<i>As long as life endures</i>

428
00:51:25,557 --> 00:51:30,221
<i>It's yours, this heart of mine</i>

429

Hello, operator?
I just dialed a number.

444
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:07,506
What? No outgoing calls?

445
00:58:08,142 --> 00:58:13,705
I mailed you a check yesterday.
You'll positively receive it tomorrow.

446
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:16,280
You'll leave the phone connected?
Thank you.

447
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,942
Please get me that number.

448
00:58:20,655 --> 00:58:23,453
Hello. Is this the butcher?
This is Mrs. Ederman.

449
00:58:23,658 --> 00:58:27,560
I got to have 2 pound
lamb chops right away for dinner.

450
00:58:27,729 --> 00:58:31,256
No meat? I mailed you
a check yesterday.

451
00:58:31,432 --> 00:58:34,959
You'll positively receive it tomorrow.

452
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:39,805
I'll get the lamb chops tomorrow.
Thank you.

453
00:58:43,411 --> 00:58:46,175
I mailed you...
Oh, it's the door.

454
00:58:46,414 --> 00:58:48,041
Come in.

455
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:49,815
- Mrs. Ederman?
- Yeah.

456
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,781
- A cablegram.
- A cablegram?

457
00:58:51,953 --> 00:58:54,581
- Yeah, from... From Ireland.
- Ireland? Let me see.

458
00:58:54,756 --> 00:58:57,748
- Who do I know in Ireland?
- I think you won the sweepstakes.

459
00:58:57,925 --> 00:59:02,521
"Congratulations,
your ticket number 44678...

460
00:59:02,697 --> 00:59:07,293
...has been drawn
in the Irish Sweepstakes."

461
00:59:08,069 --> 00:59:09,832
Here. I got no change.

462
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:12,472
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

463
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:18,311
I... I won. I won.

464
00:59:18,479 --> 00:59:22,575
Well, somebody, I won.
Oi, Monty, Monty.

465
00:59:22,784 --> 00:59:26,777
Hello. I won.
Oi, Ireland, what a marvelous city.

466
00:59:26,988 --> 00:59:28,387
Is that you, Monty?

467
00:59:28,589 --> 00:59:32,787
- Norma? Is dinner re...?
- Monty. I love you. Monty, I love you.

468
00:59:32,994 --> 00:59:34,894
What's the matter?
You been untrue to me?

469
00:59:35,096 --> 00:59:37,860
Yes. No. I mean,
I just got a cable from Ireland.

470
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:41,331
- Monty, have I got a surprise for you.
- What is it?

471
00:59:41,502 --> 00:59:43,402
The ticket you bought
on the sweepstakes?

472
00:59:43,604 --> 00:59:45,799
- Yes.
- Well, it won.

473
00:59:46,007 --> 00:59:47,872
We won a steak?

474
00:59:48,142 --> 00:59:51,407
- We... We won the sweepstakes?
- Yeah.

475
00:59:51,612 --> 00:59:53,842
A glass of water, please.

476
00:59:54,015 --> 00:59:56,984
What do you mean, water?
Champagne. We're rich.

477
00:59:57,151 --> 01:00:01,053
All our troubles are over.
Dance. Do something.

478
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:03,690
- Oi, Monty.
- Hurrah. We're rich.

479
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:05,722
We're rich. We got...

480
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,498
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

481
01:00:11,933 --> 01:00:15,391
Monty, don't go crazy yet.
Wait till we get the money.

482
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,061
I haven't gone crazy.
Something terrible has happened.

483
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:20,571
What could be terrible
when we won the sweepstakes?

484
01:00:20,741 --> 01:00:24,233
I met the landlord in the hall and
had to pay him the month's rent, $45.

485
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,073
So? We'll buy the house.

486
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,373
But you don't understand,
I only had $42.50.

487
01:00:28,549 --> 01:00:32,918
To make up the extra two dollars and
a half, I gave the landlord the ticket.

488
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:34,952
So what?

489
01:00:36,757 --> 01:00:40,090
- What did you say?
- I gave the landlord the ticket.

490
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:46,264
- Monty, dear, you should drop dead.
- I'll jump out the window.

491
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:47,901
Who stops you?

492
01:00:48,069 --> 01:00:50,435
If he knows the ticket won,
he won't give it back.

493
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:52,596
But if he don't know,
we'll get it. Quick.

494
01:00:52,773 --> 01:00:54,263
- He's out in the hall.
- Get him.

495
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:57,275
- Get him.
- Mr. Martin.

496
01:00:57,478 --> 01:01:00,970
Mr. Martin. Mr. Martin.

497
01:01:01,249 --> 01:01:03,114
Why, come in, Mr. Martin.

498
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:05,616
Funny, my wife
was just talking about you.

499
01:01:05,786 --> 01:01:08,277
- Hello, Mrs. Ederman.
- Hello, Mr. Martin. Sit down.

500
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:09,787
- Thanks.
- You look good.

501
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,618
You look absolutely wonderful.

502
01:01:11,792 --> 01:01:14,659
Make yourself at home.
Here. Take an apple.

503
01:01:14,829 --> 01:01:16,558
- Thank you.
- You know, Mr. Martin...

504
01:01:16,731 --> 01:01:19,757
...my wife is so superstitious
about that sweepstake ticket.

505
01:01:19,934 --> 01:01:21,663
- Yeah.
- If you let me have it back...

506
01:01:21,836 --> 01:01:23,633
...l'll give you the 2.50 tomorrow.

507
01:01:23,804 --> 01:01:25,795
If that's why
you called me in, I'm going.

508
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:29,340
I've got the ticket here in my wallet
and that's where it's gonna stay.

509
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:31,501
- No, no. Sit down.
- You just arrived. Yes.

510
01:01:31,712 --> 01:01:33,771
You know, you never
come around to see us...

511
01:01:33,948 --> 01:01:36,178
...and we're always
so glad to see you.

512
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:39,251
Why don't you make yourself
comfortable?

513
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:41,513
- Go on. Take off your coat.
- All right.

514
01:01:41,722 --> 01:01:43,849
Sure, take it off.
It's hot in here, you know.

515
01:01:44,025 --> 01:01:46,493
Oh, it's so wrinkled.
I could press it for you.

516
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,424
Oh, thank you.

517
01:01:48,629 --> 01:01:52,087
The pants is wrinkled too.
I could press the whole suit in a jiffy.

518
01:01:52,266 --> 01:01:54,325
- No, never mind.
- Sure. Take off your pants.

519
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:55,696
Never mind the pants.

520
01:01:55,870 --> 01:01:58,202
If it'll make you feel at home,
I'll take off mine.

521
01:01:58,372 --> 01:01:59,634
No, just press the coat.

522
01:01:59,807 --> 01:02:04,039
Do you know that I have a feeling
that this ticket's gonna win?

523
01:02:05,246 --> 01:02:07,271
Pardon me. I don't feel so good.

524
01:02:07,448 --> 01:02:08,972
Come in.

525
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:10,811
Here, Mr. Martin. Sit down again.

526
01:02:10,985 --> 01:02:12,646
- Have an apple.
- Oh, thanks.

527
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,014
Cablegram, Mrs. Ederman.

528
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,748
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Beat it.

529
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:29,560
- Why did he offer you congratulations?
- A relative died.

530
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:32,238
- Oh, that's too bad.
- Yeah, it's terrible, ain't it?

531
01:02:32,406 --> 01:02:35,466
- Now I'm gonna press your coat.
- Thank you.

532
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,410
Monty. Monty.

533
01:02:41,582 --> 01:02:46,918
A London syndicate is offering us
$25,000 for the ticket.

534
01:02:47,088 --> 01:02:49,682
And we ain't got the ticket.

535
01:02:50,658 --> 01:02:52,489
Talk. Talk.

536
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:54,924
- Talk, talk. Talk, talk.
- Well, I...

537
01:02:55,096 --> 01:02:57,064
Don't say a word.
Don't say a word.

538
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:59,290
The trouble with you,
you get too excited.

539
01:02:59,834 --> 01:03:02,200
Don't get excited.

540
01:03:13,881 --> 01:03:17,044
Don't get excited.
Don't get excited.

541
01:03:17,218 --> 01:03:18,742
Hold yourself together.

542
01:03:18,919 --> 01:03:21,387
Don't go to pieces.

543
01:03:21,555 --> 01:03:23,614
Hold yourself together.

544
01:03:25,926 --> 01:03:28,326
- You all right?
- Fine.

545
01:03:31,899 --> 01:03:34,265
What will we do?
What will we do?

546
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:37,370
Let's tell him the truth.
Maybe he'll give us half the money.

547
01:03:37,538 --> 01:03:39,870
Poison, he'll give us.

548
01:03:40,207 --> 01:03:42,437
That's what's the trouble with you.

549
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:46,273
You get excited.
You go to pieces.

550
01:03:47,148 --> 01:03:48,877
I got an idea.

551
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:52,645
If we get excited,
he'll get suspicious.

552
01:03:52,853 --> 01:03:55,879
So we'll go in there,
and we'll act very nonchalantly.

553
01:03:56,057 --> 01:03:58,048
- You know, namby-pamby.
- Pamby-namby?

554
01:03:58,225 --> 01:04:01,456
See, like nothing happened.
Wait, where's a cigarette?

555
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:04,325
Here. Here. Put a cigarette in there.

556
01:04:04,498 --> 01:04:06,966
Now laugh.
Laugh like you told me a funny story.

557
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:09,568
Like nothing happened. Laugh.

558
01:04:11,405 --> 01:04:13,635
Oh, Monty.

559
01:04:14,241 --> 01:04:17,108
That was the funniest story.

560
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:19,670
Tell it to him.

561
01:04:20,381 --> 01:04:24,078
Mr. Martin, my wife is so in love
with that sweepstake ticket.

562
01:04:24,251 --> 01:04:26,685
Not that it means anything,
just a whim.

563
01:04:26,887 --> 01:04:29,412
Mr. Martin, if that ticket did win,
what would you do?

564
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:33,492
I'd hop on a boat, go over to Ireland
and collect the money.

565
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:37,264
Monty. Monty.

566
01:04:38,999 --> 01:04:41,593
Monty, it didn't work.

567
01:04:41,769 --> 01:04:45,102
We was too namby-pamby.
Now what will we do?

568
01:04:45,272 --> 01:04:47,763
Honesty is the best policy.
Let's tell him the truth.

569
01:04:47,942 --> 01:04:50,968
- There must be an easier way.
- George Washington told the truth.

570
01:04:51,145 --> 01:04:52,544
Did he win a sweepstakes?

571
01:04:52,713 --> 01:04:56,012
Besides, this man
is holding back our property.

572
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:58,549
- Here. Take this vase.
- What for?

573
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:02,655
Just a light tap. Not hard.
Just a little tap on his head.

574
01:05:02,823 --> 01:05:05,053
- Don't break the vase.
- Why should I hit him?

575
01:05:05,226 --> 01:05:07,956
- Say he tried to kiss me.
- Who would believe it?

576
01:05:08,129 --> 01:05:11,292
I can dream, can't I? Wait.

577
01:05:11,465 --> 01:05:13,365
I know how to get the ticket.

578
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:15,434
I'll flirt with him.

579
01:05:16,737 --> 01:05:18,796
If I only had a sweater.

580
01:05:18,973 --> 01:05:20,736
I'll take this.

581
01:05:21,942 --> 01:05:24,502
I'll get that ticket
or my middle name ain't Violet.

582
01:05:24,678 --> 01:05:26,873
I'll captivate him.

583
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:30,748
- Am I captivating?
- I never noticed it before.

584
01:05:30,951 --> 01:05:34,045
Norma, I think you've got
something there, but don't go too far.

585
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:37,349
No, just far enough
to get the ticket.

586
01:05:45,533 --> 01:05:47,933
What's the matter?
Did you hurt yourself?

587
01:05:48,102 --> 01:05:49,831
No.

588
01:05:50,771 --> 01:05:52,898
You know, Mr. Martin...

589
01:05:53,073 --> 01:05:58,568
...I find life just too dull for words.

590
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,271
- Ain't you?
- What?

591
01:06:01,482 --> 01:06:05,179
All my life. All my life...

592
01:06:05,352 --> 01:06:08,515
...l've been languishing
away in this terrible flat.

593
01:06:08,689 --> 01:06:11,624
What's the matter? Is there something
wrong with the plumbing?

594
01:06:11,792 --> 01:06:15,728
No, it's not that. It's my husband.

595
01:06:15,996 --> 01:06:18,521
He don't understand me.

596
01:06:18,732 --> 01:06:21,428
Is that so?
Well, do you know, Mrs. Ederman...

597
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:25,936
...you're looking very attractive.
- You think so?

598
01:06:28,142 --> 01:06:31,805
- Would you like to loll away the time?
- Yes.

599
01:06:32,012 --> 01:06:34,879
Shall I turn on the radio?
And we'll dance?

600
01:06:35,049 --> 01:06:37,745
- Yes.
- And we'll have a good time?

601
01:06:39,753 --> 01:06:42,517
- Can you do the jitterbug?
- Well, I'll take a chance.

602
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:45,415
Spanish, Señor Martin.

603
01:06:45,593 --> 01:06:47,823
You know, my grandfather
was a Spaniard.

604
01:07:20,261 --> 01:07:23,025
So that's what you're up to, huh?
The old Badger game.

605
01:07:23,197 --> 01:07:25,859
You'll not get away with it.
I'll have you arrested.

606
01:07:26,066 --> 01:07:30,002
Oh, please don't do that, Mr. Martin.
I might as well tell you the truth.

607
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:33,298
That ticket you've got
won the sweepstakes...

608
01:07:33,474 --> 01:07:37,342
...and they're offering
$25,000 for it.

609
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:41,106
- You mean this ticket won?
- It won.

610
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:47,550
You're right, Monty.

611
01:07:47,721 --> 01:07:51,282
Honesty is the best policy.

612
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:17,070
<i>Love can be a moment's madness</i>

613
01:09:17,244 --> 01:09:20,907
<i>Love can be insane</i>

614
01:09:21,081 --> 01:09:28,715
<i>Love can be a life</i>
<i>Of sadness and pain</i>

615
01:09:29,189 --> 01:09:33,387
<i>Love can be a summer shower</i>

616
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:37,223
<i>Love can be the sun</i>

617
01:09:37,398 --> 01:09:45,066
<i>Love can be two hearts</i>
<i>That flower as one</i>

618
01:09:45,606 --> 01:09:53,843
<i>It can be fine and free</i>

619
01:09:54,014 --> 01:09:58,007
<i>But it's true</i>

620
01:09:58,218 --> 01:10:02,018
<i>It doesn't always happen to you</i>

621
01:10:02,222 --> 01:10:06,249
<i>Love can be a dying amber</i>

622
01:10:06,427 --> 01:10:10,158
<i>Love can be a flame</i>

623
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:14,357
<i>Love pledged in September</i>

624
01:10:14,535 --> 01:10:18,437
<i>May be dead in December</i>

625
01:10:18,605 --> 01:10:26,444
<i>You may not even remember</i>
<i>It came</i>

626
01:10:26,613 --> 01:10:31,141
<i>Oh, love can be a joy forever</i>

627
01:10:31,318 --> 01:10:35,049
<i>Or an empty name</i>

628
01:10:35,255 --> 01:10:43,060
<i>Love is almost never ever the same</i>

629
01:10:55,542 --> 01:11:00,002
<i>Oh, love can be a cup of sorrow</i>

630
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:03,911
<i>Love can be a lie</i>

631
01:11:04,084 --> 01:11:12,048
<i>Love can make you wake tomorrow</i>
<i>And sigh</i>

632
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:16,322
<i>Love can be a snow-capped mountain</i>

633
01:11:16,497 --> 01:11:20,490
<i>Love can be the truth</i>

634
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:27,539
<i>Love can be an endless</i>
<i>Fountain of youth</i>

635
01:11:28,742 --> 01:11:36,740
<i>It can be ecstasy</i>

636
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:40,614
<i>But that kind</i>

637
01:11:40,821 --> 01:11:43,915
<i>Is not so very easy to find</i>

638
01:11:44,124 --> 01:11:49,027
<i>Oh, love can be a tinkling cymbal</i>

639
01:11:49,196 --> 01:11:53,257
<i>Love can be a dirge</i>

640
01:11:53,433 --> 01:11:57,096
<i>Love may seem amusing</i>

641
01:11:57,271 --> 01:12:01,207
<i>A spark constantly fusing</i>

642
01:12:01,375 --> 01:12:08,247
<i>But it may end up by losing</i>
<i>Its urge</i>

643
01:12:08,715 --> 01:12:13,812
<i>Oh, love can be a sweet endeavor</i>

644
01:12:13,987 --> 01:12:17,889
<i>Or a dirty shame</i>

645
01:12:18,058 --> 01:12:24,657
<i>Love is almost never ever</i>

646
01:12:25,165 --> 01:12:31,502
<i>The same</i>

647
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:56,360
This is the Clumsy
Television Broadcasting System.

648
01:12:56,530 --> 01:13:00,591
When you hear the musical note
will somebody tell me what time it is?

649
01:13:02,402 --> 01:13:05,303
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Lovely evening, isn't it?

650
01:13:05,472 --> 01:13:07,633
Wheel your mother-in-law
close to the radio...

651
01:13:07,808 --> 01:13:10,140
...because this is
the <i>Guzzler's Gin Program</i>.

652
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:12,539
You tried Guzzler's?
It comes in two sizes...

653
01:13:12,713 --> 01:13:14,704
...the college size
and the jumbo elephant.

654
01:13:14,915 --> 01:13:18,112
With Guzzler's
there's no bad taste, no after...

655
01:13:23,624 --> 01:13:26,684
No bad taste, no aftereffect,
no upsetting the nerves.

656
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:29,055
Just a nice smooth drink.

657
01:13:29,229 --> 01:13:31,789
Pour a little in your glass
and drink it right down.

658
01:13:31,965 --> 01:13:36,368
But be sure and ask for Guzzler's Gin,
a nice smooth drink.

659
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:50,843
Guzz...

660
01:13:51,018 --> 01:13:54,078
Guzzler's Gin, friends.
Drink a little after dinner.

661
01:13:54,254 --> 01:13:57,712
Drink some before
and you won't have to eat any dinner.

662
01:13:57,891 --> 01:14:00,052
I'll be back with more
from our sponsors.

663
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:03,754
In the meantime here is our guest star
of the evening, Mr...

664
01:14:03,964 --> 01:14:05,727
Mr...

665
01:14:05,966 --> 01:14:07,866
Subpoena.

666
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:14,863
J. Newton Numbskull:
Doctor of Poetry.

667
01:14:15,042 --> 01:14:17,203
Thank you. Thank you.

668
01:14:17,377 --> 01:14:19,607
My first poem.

669
01:14:20,213 --> 01:14:22,044
"Greetings."

670
01:14:28,288 --> 01:14:30,722
My first poem, "Algy."

671
01:14:30,891 --> 01:14:33,451
<i>Algy saw a bear</i>
<i>The bear saw Algy</i>

672
01:14:33,627 --> 01:14:36,289
<i>The bear was bulgy</i>
<i>The bulge was Algy</i>

673
01:14:40,567 --> 01:14:43,695
And now back to our announcer
and more from our sponsors:

674
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:45,303
Guzzler's Gin.

675
01:14:46,573 --> 01:14:49,235
Thank you, Newty, thank you.

676
01:14:53,113 --> 01:14:56,947
This is the <i>Guzzler's Gin Program</i>
you're looking at.

677
01:14:57,117 --> 01:14:59,881
Have you tried Guzzler's?
It comes in two sizes.

678
01:15:00,053 --> 01:15:01,384
Get a college size.

679
01:15:01,555 --> 01:15:05,047
One bottle
and you're in a class by yourself.

680
01:15:05,726 --> 01:15:07,660
With Guzzler's there's no bad taste...

681
01:15:07,828 --> 01:15:11,958
...no aftereffect,
no upsetting the nerves.

682
01:15:12,599 --> 01:15:16,968
Just a nice smooth drink.

683
01:15:19,639 --> 01:15:21,937
Pour a little in your glass...

684
01:15:26,279 --> 01:15:28,645
There goes my nails.

685
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:31,613
Pour a little in your glass
and drink it right down.

686
01:15:31,785 --> 01:15:37,655
But be sure and ask for Guzzler's Gin
a nice smooth drink.

687
01:15:41,294 --> 01:15:44,991
Oh, why can't I get
an oatmeal program?

688
01:15:45,932 --> 01:15:50,767
Guzzler's a nice smooth drink.

689
01:16:02,115 --> 01:16:04,310
Guzzler's Gin, friends.

690
01:16:04,484 --> 01:16:07,681
It comes in five...
Two sizes, two sizes.

691
01:16:07,854 --> 01:16:11,119
Now back to our guest star
J. Newton Numbskull.

692
01:16:11,291 --> 01:16:15,159
Thank you, thank you,
you drunken tramp, you.

693
01:16:15,796 --> 01:16:17,457
My next poem.

694
01:16:17,631 --> 01:16:20,794
"Put 15 cents on number four"...

695
01:16:22,402 --> 01:16:25,633
My next poem, "The Garters."

696
01:16:25,806 --> 01:16:28,832
<i>I bought my girl some garters</i>
<i>At the local five and ten</i>

697
01:16:29,009 --> 01:16:32,342
<i>She gave them to her mother</i>
<i>That's the last I'll see of them</i>

698
01:16:38,618 --> 01:16:43,521
And now back to our announcer who
will sign off the <i>Guzzler's Gin Program.</i>

699
01:16:54,734 --> 01:16:58,534
Smooth.

700
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:05,037
Have you tried Guzzler's?
It comes in 29 sizes.

701
01:17:05,912 --> 01:17:08,176
With Guzzler's
you don't need a chaser.

702
01:17:08,348 --> 01:17:11,215
Nothing could catch you.

703
01:17:12,152 --> 01:17:14,347
Save money.
Get the jumbo elephant size.

704
01:17:14,521 --> 01:17:16,921
Only 25 cents a quart.

705
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:20,924
Return the bottle
and get your 15 cents back.

706
01:17:21,394 --> 01:17:25,194
Smooth.

707
01:17:27,734 --> 01:17:30,532
Thought it was my tongue
hanging out.

708
01:17:30,704 --> 01:17:33,036
Pour a little in your glass...

709
01:17:44,584 --> 01:17:48,452
Smooth.

710
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:51,318
Pour a little in your glass...
I'll get rid of it somehow.

711
01:17:51,491 --> 01:17:55,052
Pour a little in your glass
and drink it right down.

712
01:18:09,442 --> 01:18:12,138
Smooth.

713
01:18:48,281 --> 01:18:56,518
<i>In Limehouse</i>
<i>Where Orientals love to play</i>

714
01:18:56,756 --> 01:19:05,061
<i>In Limehouse</i>
<i>Where you can hear those blues all day</i>

715
01:19:05,265 --> 01:19:09,497
<i>And they seem all around</i>

716
01:19:09,669 --> 01:19:14,129
<i>Like a long, long sigh</i>

717
01:19:14,307 --> 01:19:18,801
<i>Queer sob sigh</i>

718
01:19:18,979 --> 01:19:27,250
<i>"Oh, honey lamb," they seem to cry</i>

719
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:29,012
<i>Such a lovely sight</i>

720
01:19:29,189 --> 01:19:32,488
<i>And everything was simply grand</i>
<i>That is until last night</i>

721
01:19:32,659 --> 01:19:34,559
<i>He pinched me</i>
<i>He pinched me</i>

722
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:39,563
<i>He wouldn't let me be</i>
<i>I think he did it just to make...</i>

723
01:19:49,442 --> 01:19:52,605
<i>Last night down our alley came a toff</i>

724
01:19:52,812 --> 01:19:55,838
<i>Nice old geezer with a nasty cough</i>

725
01:19:56,016 --> 01:19:59,179
<i>Sees my missis, takes the lady off</i>

726
01:19:59,352 --> 01:20:02,185
<i>In a very gentlemanly way</i>

727
01:20:02,389 --> 01:20:05,552
<i>"Ma'am," says he,</i>
<i>"I have some news to tell</i>

728
01:20:05,725 --> 01:20:08,717
<i>Your rich uncle Tom of Camberwell</i>

729
01:20:08,895 --> 01:20:11,864
<i>Has popped off</i>
<i>And really now it ain't a sell</i>

730
01:20:12,032 --> 01:20:14,899
<i>Left to you his little donkey shay"</i>

731
01:20:15,068 --> 01:20:18,265
<i>"Wot cher,"</i>
<i>All the neighbors say</i>

732
01:20:18,438 --> 01:20:21,407
<i>"Who you going to meet, Bill?</i>
<i>Think you own the street, Bill?"</i>

733
01:20:21,574 --> 01:20:24,702
<i>Laugh, I thought I would've died</i>

734
01:20:24,911 --> 01:20:26,879
<i>Knocked him in the Old Kent Road</i>

735
01:21:41,988 --> 01:21:49,622
<i>Oh, Limehouse kid</i>
<i>Oh, oh, oh, Limehouse kid</i>

736
01:21:50,063 --> 01:21:56,992
<i>Going the way</i>
<i>That the rest of them did</i>

737
01:21:58,138 --> 01:22:05,874
<i>Poor broken blossom</i>
<i>And nobody's child</i>

738
01:22:06,246 --> 01:22:09,443
<i>Haunting and taunting</i>

739
01:22:09,649 --> 01:22:16,054
<i>You're just kind of wild, oh</i>

740
01:22:16,256 --> 01:22:23,822
<i>Oh, Limehouse blues</i>
<i>I've the real Limehouse blues</i>

741
01:22:24,197 --> 01:22:31,899
<i>Learned from the willow</i>
<i>Those sad China blues</i>

742
01:22:32,272 --> 01:22:36,038
<i>Rings on your fingers</i>

743
01:22:36,242 --> 01:22:40,338
<i>And tears for a crown</i>

744
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:45,710
<i>That is the story</i>

745
01:22:46,186 --> 01:22:54,059
<i>Of old Chinatown</i>

746
01:31:12,858 --> 01:31:18,922

The other gentlemen are here.
Please come in.

01:32:49,989 --> 01:32:53,823
<i>And in advance</i>
<i>The critics are all in accord</i>

760
01:32:54,193 --> 01:32:57,185
<i>She's gonna win</i>
<i>The next Academy Award</i>

761
01:32:57,396 --> 01:33:00,797
<i>All her fans will be delighted</i>
<i>Not to mention quite excited</i>

762
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,400
<i>At her personal appearance</i>
<i>Presently</i>

763
01:33:04,136 --> 01:33:08,038
<i>She's "stupendious," "tremendious"</i>
<i>"Collosical," "terrifical"</i>

764
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:11,334
<i>She's got it</i>
<i>But definitely</i>

765
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:21,613
<i>The glamorous amorous lady</i>
<i>They call...</i>

766
01:34:02,895 --> 01:34:06,456
Fribbins, what is all this?

767
01:34:06,699 --> 01:34:09,668
The gentlemen of the press, milady.

768
01:34:10,236 --> 01:34:12,966
Darlings.

769
01:34:13,205 --> 01:34:18,199
How utterly charming of you
to have dropped in like this.

770
01:34:18,410 --> 01:34:24,872
How delightfully informal of you
to have dropped in like this.

771
01:34:25,551 --> 01:34:31,615
I mean, how perfectly
marvelous of you to have...

772
01:34:32,391 --> 01:34:37,294
Well, you have dropped in,
haven't you?

773
01:34:37,496 --> 01:34:39,396
And I...

774
01:34:39,565 --> 01:34:42,227
Well, gentlemen...

775
01:34:42,434 --> 01:34:47,201
...you have caught me
pitifully unprepared.

776
01:34:58,350 --> 01:35:01,842
And now you may rise.

777
01:35:03,589 --> 01:35:06,649
And now you may rise.

778
01:35:07,826 --> 01:35:11,523
Come. Get up, get up, get up.
Let's get on with this.

779
01:35:11,730 --> 01:35:14,597
There. Now, that's better, isn't it?

780
01:35:16,268 --> 01:35:18,998
Gentlemen of the press.

781
01:35:19,238 --> 01:35:23,038
Members of the fourth estate,
what can I do for you?

782
01:35:23,275 --> 01:35:25,106
Tell me, pray do.

783
01:35:25,311 --> 01:35:30,681
<i>Oh, glamorous lady</i>
<i>Oh, amorous lady</i>

784
01:35:30,883 --> 01:35:37,118
<i>Oh, "hamorous" lady</i>
<i>Here's to you</i>

785
01:35:38,557 --> 01:35:44,154
<i>And humbly we're here to</i>
<i>Quite mumbly we're here to</i>

786
01:35:44,363 --> 01:35:52,395
<i>"Humdrumly" we're here</i>
<i>To interview you</i>

787
01:35:57,343 --> 01:36:00,039
<i>We're here to pry</i>
<i>Into your private life</i>

788
01:36:00,279 --> 01:36:03,043
<i>We're here to seek</i>
<i>Your every secret</i>

789
01:36:03,282 --> 01:36:06,547
<i>We're here to scoop a scoop</i>
<i>Obviously</i>

790
01:36:07,152 --> 01:36:09,586
<i>What is your next vehicle to be?</i>

791
01:36:11,857 --> 01:36:15,384
This is much too much.

792
01:36:15,594 --> 01:36:19,894
A sort of a bit of a go and touch.

793
01:36:20,099 --> 01:36:24,559
But confidentially, gentlemen,
and this is off the record, of course.

794
01:36:24,803 --> 01:36:26,498
Of course.

795
01:36:27,106 --> 01:36:31,099
But about my next picture...

796
01:36:32,211 --> 01:36:36,113
I'm faced with a curious problem.

797
01:36:37,383 --> 01:36:42,082
<i>Shall I always be dramatic?</i>

798
01:36:42,321 --> 01:36:45,256
<i>Biographically emphatic?</i>

799
01:36:45,457 --> 01:36:50,190
<i>Should I devote my life</i>
<i>To the legitimate art?</i>

800
01:36:51,263 --> 01:36:55,256
<i>Or should I do what I'd adore so?</i>

801
01:36:55,467 --> 01:37:01,702
<i>Do my acting with my torso</i>
<i>And give all the natives a start?</i>

802
01:37:02,574 --> 01:37:06,374
<i>Must the roles I play be tragic?</i>

803
01:37:06,578 --> 01:37:10,537
<i>Full of Oscar-winning magic?</i>

804
01:37:10,749 --> 01:37:15,982
<i>Should I drain the cup of drama</i>
<i>To its dregs?</i>

805
01:37:17,856 --> 01:37:22,384
<i>Or do you think it is permissible</i>

806
01:37:22,761 --> 01:37:25,992
<i>To be, for once, quite kissable</i>

807
01:37:26,231 --> 01:37:28,495
<i>And give them a peep of my legs?</i>

808
01:37:31,970 --> 01:37:35,462
<i>I'd like to be a pinup girl</i>

809
01:37:35,674 --> 01:37:38,404
<i>A cheesecake girl too</i>

810
01:37:38,811 --> 01:37:44,909
<i>And what is Ginger Rogers</i>
<i>That I am not?</i>

811
01:37:45,117 --> 01:37:51,113
<i>And what has Betty Grable got</i>
<i>That I haven't got?</i>

812
01:37:51,323 --> 01:37:57,990
<i>Oh, the cinema must exhibit me</i>
<i>In roles that so inhibit me</i>

813
01:37:58,197 --> 01:38:03,100
<i>I feel, well, I feel just like a soldier</i>
<i>Out of step</i>

814
01:38:03,302 --> 01:38:04,599
Yes.

815
01:38:04,803 --> 01:38:09,297
<i>But would the episode outlive me?</i>

816
01:38:09,508 --> 01:38:13,467
<i>Would my public quite forgive me?</i>

817
01:38:13,645 --> 01:38:19,106
<i>If I tried to show the world</i>
<i>I'm really hep?</i>

818
01:38:22,921 --> 01:38:25,321
Oh, but now, you darlings.

819
01:38:25,491 --> 01:38:28,289
You adorable dear, dear boys.

820
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:33,454
I'm going to tell you
all about my next picture.

821
01:38:35,434 --> 01:38:37,868
What is my next picture?

822
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:40,732
No, don't tell me, don't tell me.

823
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,967
Excuse me, darling.

824
01:38:50,883 --> 01:38:54,046
<i>Madame Crematante.</i>

825
01:38:54,887 --> 01:38:57,651
<i>Madame Crematante</i>, gentlemen...

826
01:38:57,823 --> 01:39:01,987
...will be a monumental
biographical tribute...

827
01:39:02,161 --> 01:39:05,858
...to a monumental
biographical woman...

828
01:39:06,031 --> 01:39:12,903
...who toiled, searched, starved...

829
01:39:13,572 --> 01:39:18,066
...slaved, suffered...

830
01:39:19,211 --> 01:39:23,375
...pioneered, so that the world...

831
01:39:23,549 --> 01:39:26,541
...you and I...

832
01:39:26,718 --> 01:39:29,949
...could reap the benefits
of her magnificent discovery:

833
01:39:30,122 --> 01:39:32,249
The safety pin.

834
01:39:35,194 --> 01:39:39,062
The story starts in a dark, dank...

835
01:39:39,231 --> 01:39:43,429
...dingy tenement in Amsterdam.

836
01:39:43,769 --> 01:39:45,760
Holland, you know.

837
01:39:45,938 --> 01:39:48,702
In the flat of a poor
impoverished family...

838
01:39:48,874 --> 01:39:51,069
...but of rather good antecedents.

839
01:39:51,243 --> 01:39:56,738
Gretchen Crematante was a very
brave and noble woman who...

840
01:39:56,949 --> 01:39:59,975
...against the wishes of her father...
The baron, you know.

841
01:40:00,152 --> 01:40:05,283
- Married this young inventor
who didn't have a sou, penniless.

842
01:40:05,457 --> 01:40:09,393
<i>- And there they were in Amsterdam</i>
<i>- In Amsterdam?</i>

843
01:40:09,561 --> 01:40:13,156
<i>Yes, there they were</i>
<i>In a dark and dingy tenement flat</i>

844
01:40:13,332 --> 01:40:18,099
<i>With no food and no heat</i>
<i>And no money for to pay the rent</i>

845
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:20,738
<i>- But did they care?</i>
<i>- No, they don't care</i>

846
01:40:20,906 --> 01:40:22,771
<i>Madame Crematante</i>
<i>She don't care</i>

847
01:40:22,941 --> 01:40:25,307
<i>'Cause she seen the light</i>
<i>Just the other day</i>

848
01:40:25,477 --> 01:40:27,775
<i>Since then she been trying</i>
<i>For to find a way</i>

849
01:40:27,946 --> 01:40:30,005
<i>For to bring to the world a big invent</i>

850
01:40:30,182 --> 01:40:32,548
<i>- And so she did</i>
<i>- And so she did</i>

851
01:40:33,619 --> 01:40:34,950
<i>Madame Crematante did</i>

852
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:37,418
<i>She toiled and strived</i>
<i>And sweat and slaved</i>

853
01:40:37,589 --> 01:40:39,853
<i>A- stretchin' her mind</i>
<i>And beginnin' to rave</i>

854
01:40:40,058 --> 01:40:42,322
<i>But the price she paid</i>
<i>Was worth the pain</i>

855
01:40:42,494 --> 01:40:44,587
<i>For on a cold and frosty morn</i>

856
01:40:44,763 --> 01:40:48,028
<i>- Oh, no</i>
<i>- The safety pin was born</i>

857
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:52,830
<i>Hallelujah, Hallelujah</i>
<i>Halle, lu, lu, lu, lu, jah</i>

858
01:40:53,005 --> 01:40:57,101
<i>Hallelujah, Hallelujah</i>
<i>Halle, lu, lu, lu, lu, jah</i>

859
01:40:57,276 --> 01:40:59,642
<i>Shout hallelujah and a big amen</i>

860
01:40:59,811 --> 01:41:01,938
<i>For the lady with the safety pin</i>

861
01:41:02,114 --> 01:41:05,515
<i>She really rocks about and gives you</i>
<i>What more do you want?</i>

862
01:41:05,684 --> 01:41:08,152
<i>- Madame Crematante</i>
<i>- Hallelujah, Hallelujah</i>

863
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:11,687
<i>Hallelujah, Hallelujah</i>

864
01:41:16,595 --> 01:41:19,393
<i>Scream and shout</i>
<i>Who cares what it's all about</i>

865
01:41:19,598 --> 01:41:22,726
<i>Just as long as you're stompin'</i>
<i>And jivin' and gassin' and gabbin'</i>

866
01:41:22,901 --> 01:41:26,029
<i>And jammin' and jumpin'</i>
<i>When you talk about the safety pin</i>

867
01:41:26,204 --> 01:41:29,901
<i>Who's got the safety pin?</i>
<i>Slip me the safety pin</i>

868
01:41:30,108 --> 01:41:33,305
<i>- No doubt about it</i>

869
01:41:33,478 --> 01:41:35,469

<i>The safety pin</i>

01:41:35,647 --> 01:41:37,512
<i>The safety pin</i>
<i>The safety pin</i>

01:41:37,683 --> 01:41:39,480
<i>The safety pin</i>
<i>Madame Crematante</i>

872
01:41:39,651 --> 01:41:43,985
<i>She's a lady who was heaven-sent</i>
<i>She's the lady with the big invent</i>

873
01:41:53,699 --> 01:41:55,360
<i>- Safety pin</i>

<i>Madame Crematante the big invent</i>

878
01:42:57,195 --> 01:42:59,789
How are you?

879
01:43:03,735 --> 01:43:08,968
- Say, you're Fred Astaire. Hello.
- That's right. Hello.

880
01:43:09,641 --> 01:43:14,635
I'm sorry, I can't quite place you.
What line of business are you in?

881
01:43:15,447 --> 01:43:17,915
Well, I dance.

882
01:43:18,083 --> 01:43:20,950
Oh, at home for the folks,
picnics and that kind of thing?

883
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:24,282
- No, in public.
- On street corners?

884
01:43:24,456 --> 01:43:26,947
Oh, no. On the screen.
Motion pictures.

885
01:43:27,125 --> 01:43:30,185
You do go to pictures
that have dancing in them, don't you?

886
01:43:30,362 --> 01:43:32,523
I try to see them all.
I go as often as I can.

887
01:43:32,731 --> 01:43:34,858
Did you see a picture
called <i>Cover Girl</i>?

888
01:43:35,033 --> 01:43:36,660
Yes.

889
01:43:37,035 --> 01:43:40,095
Well, who did all the dancing
in that?

890
01:43:41,239 --> 01:43:43,730
You're not Rita Hayworth?

891
01:43:45,977 --> 01:43:49,435
No, I'm not, Ginger.

892
01:43:51,817 --> 01:43:53,614
- Well, so long, Gene.
- See you around.

893
01:43:53,785 --> 01:43:55,480
- I've got a little number to do.
- I've got a little number to do.

894
01:43:55,654 --> 01:43:56,678
- You have?
- Well, sure.

895
01:43:56,855 --> 01:43:58,186
- Here?
- Sure.

896
01:43:58,356 --> 01:44:01,689
Say, why don't we just ad-lib
a little something together then, huh?

897
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:03,987
- Whip it up here on the spot?
- Throw it away.

898
01:44:04,162 --> 01:44:07,256
Like the one we've been rehearsing
for two weeks.

899
01:44:08,166 --> 01:44:11,624
<i>A Babbitt met a bromide</i>
<i>On the avenue one day</i>

01:44:11,803 --> 01:44:15,068
<i>And held a conversation</i>
<i>In their own peculiar way</i>

901
01:44:16,908 --> 01:44:20,309
<i>They both were solid citizens</i>
<i>They both had been around</i>

<i>- I'm great</i>
<i>- That's good</i>

01:44:34,092 --> 01:44:35,684
<i>- That's life</i>
<i>- What do you know?</i>

908
01:44:35,861 --> 01:44:37,385
<i>- How's the wife?</i>
<i>- Gotta run</i>

909
01:44:37,562 --> 01:44:38,893
<i>- Oh, my</i>
<i>- Ta-ta</i>

910
01:44:39,064 --> 01:44:40,656
<i>- Olive oil</i>
<i>- Goodbye</i>

911
01:45:12,864 --> 01:45:16,356
<i>Ten years went quickly by</i>
<i>For both these "substiantial" men</i>

912
01:45:16,535 --> 01:45:19,971
<i>And then it happened that one day</i>
<i>They chanced to meet again</i>

913
01:45:21,873 --> 01:45:25,365
<i>That they had both developed</i>
<i>In 10 years there was no doubt</i>

914
01:45:25,544 --> 01:45:28,980
<i>And so of course they had</i>
<i>An awful lot to talk about</i>

915
01:45:32,751 --> 01:45:34,776
<i>- Hello</i>
<i>- How are you?</i>

916
01:45:34,953 --> 01:45:36,580
<i>- How's the folks?</i>
<i>- What's new?</i>

917
01:45:36,755 --> 01:45:38,245
<i>- I'm great</i>
<i>- That's good</i>

918
01:45:38,957 --> 01:45:40,925
<i>- Knock wood</i>
<i>- Well, well</i>

919
01:45:41,092 --> 01:45:42,753
<i>- That's life</i>
<i>- What do you know?</i>

920
01:45:42,928 --> 01:45:44,555
<i>- How's the wife?</i>
<i>- Gotta run</i>

921
01:45:44,729 --> 01:45:46,060
<i>- Oh, my</i>
<i>- Ta-ta</i>

922
01:45:46,231 --> 01:45:47,789
<i>- Olive oil</i>
<i>- Goodbye</i>

923
01:46:51,563 --> 01:46:55,124
<i>Before they met again</i>
<i>Some 20 years they had to wait</i>

924
01:46:55,300 --> 01:46:58,633
<i>This time it happened up above</i>
<i>Inside Saint Peter's gate</i>

925
01:47:00,538 --> 01:47:04,167
<i>A harp each one was carrying</i>
<i>And both were sprouting wings</i>

926
01:47:04,342 --> 01:47:07,800
<i>And this what they said as</i>
<i>They were strumming on the strings</i>

927
01:47:11,650 --> 01:47:13,550
<i>- Hello</i>
<i>- How are you?</i>

928
01:47:13,718 --> 01:47:15,345
<i>- How's the folks?</i>
<i>- What's new?</i>

929
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:17,317
<i>- I'm great</i>
<i>- That's good</i>

930
01:47:18,189 --> 01:47:19,713
<i>- Knock wood</i>
<i>- Well, well</i>

931
01:47:19,891 --> 01:47:21,825
<i>- That's life</i>
<i>- What do you know?</i>

932
01:47:21,993 --> 01:47:23,483
<i>- How's the wife?</i>
<i>- Gotta fly</i>

933
01:47:23,662 --> 01:47:24,924
<i>- Oh, my</i>
<i>- Ta-ta</i>

934
01:47:25,096 --> 01:47:27,462
<i>- Olive oil</i>
<i>- Goodbye</i>

935
01:49:47,372 --> 01:49:51,809
<i>The gleam of a blue-white moonlight</i>

936
01:49:51,976 --> 01:49:57,073
<i>Makes diamonds of the stars</i>
<i>In the sky</i>

937
01:49:57,248 --> 01:50:07,419
<i>The gold of an autumn sunset</i>
<i>Colors a cloud passing by</i>

938
01:50:07,625 --> 01:50:12,255
<i>The night says goodbye</i>
<i>To the morning</i>

939
01:50:12,730 --> 01:50:21,729
<i>And a heart says hello to a heart</i>

940
01:50:21,906 --> 01:50:27,276
<i>All of these wonderful things</i>
<i>Shall endure</i>

941
01:50:28,046 --> 01:50:33,507
<i>They're works of art</i>

942
01:50:33,685 --> 01:50:40,090
<i>There's beauty everywhere</i>

943
01:50:40,258 --> 01:50:46,356
<i>That everyone can share</i>

944
01:50:46,865 --> 01:50:53,395
<i>A lovely world can be unfurled</i>

945
01:50:53,705 --> 01:51:00,076
<i>To those who see and care</i>

946
01:51:00,278 --> 01:51:06,183
<i>We search for beauty gay</i>

947
01:51:06,918 --> 01:51:13,289
<i>Through every livelong day</i>

948
01:51:13,491 --> 01:51:20,920
<i>And then someone comes into view</i>

949
01:51:21,099 --> 01:51:27,732
<i>And suddenly you find it's true</i>

950
01:51:27,906 --> 01:51:34,141
<i>That love is beauty too</i>

951
01:51:35,246 --> 01:51:42,584
<i>And then someone comes into view</i>

952
01:51:42,754 --> 01:51:49,318
<i>And suddenly you find it's true</i>

953
01:51:49,827 --> 01:52:04,868
<i>That love is beauty too</i>

954
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:13,597
<i>And then someone comes into view</i>

955
01:54:13,805 --> 01:54:20,677
<i>And suddenly you find it's true</i>

956
01:54:20,878 --> 01:54:31,618
<i>That love is beauty too</i>

957
01:57:30,034 --> 01:57:32,025
