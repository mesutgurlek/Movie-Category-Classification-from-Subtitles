00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:42,170
Tell your father you owe us for
two months. lt's getting difficult

10
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,515
Yes, l will

11
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:16,805
l can't do without a shave,
so please shave me

12
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:19,983
Any idea what you owe?

13
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,874
A dark girl

14
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,606
A dark complexion

15
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,175
Get off to school now

16
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:54,511
Her tuitions should be over;
she'll be hurt if she overhears

17
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,017
Such a responsible girl

18
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:04,455
Studying and giving two tuitions,
bringing home forty rupees a month

19
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:14,665
l heard at the meeting that
there are more and more evictions

20
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,204
They might even stop school grants

21
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:22,036
Would you like a mat,
to sit and gossip on?

22
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:37,092
Your sandal is torn, Khuki

23
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,658
l'll have it mended

24
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,431
Teacher, about your tax...

25
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:53,109
What a good thing l bumped into you.
Now, about your dramatic society...

26
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:05,552
<i>The bumblebee flew humming</i>
<i>into the room</i>

27
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,268
Bathe, you're late for college

28
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,108
A love letter!

29
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:17,055
''l didn't appreciate your worth,
l thought you were like the others

30
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:23,792
''But now l see you in the clouds...

31
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:30,527
''...perhaps a cloud-capped star,
veiled by circumstances...

32
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,362
''...your aura dimmed''

33
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:40,141
Sanat. That idiot! l haven't
seen him for ages

34
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:44,304
Poking your nose into personal affairs

35
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:49,076
lf you're a ''person'', then
l'll be a genius one day

36
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,652
You know that's true, hence your pride

37
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:01,898
lf only the barber would understand
what a genius l am

38
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,669
Can you spare some money?
The beard's itching

39
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,870
Two annas, or maybe four...

40
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:16,413
...or maybe eight - l'd like
some tobacco

41
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:22,077
Or why not a whole rupee. You've got
your tuition money, haven't you?

42
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,886
Why not get a job, Brother?

43
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,784
lt's beneath an artist's dignity

44
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,593
ln a couple of years, cash will
rain down on me

45
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:41,032
Do you know how much Amir Khan Sahib
gets for a concert?

46
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:47,868
Remember what l said about the rupee

47
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:57,880
Ma, Manashi in our college has
a sari with a beautiful motif...

48
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,487
...a cow-girl

49
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,988
Ma, don't listen to her

50
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:09,759
lt's the college's football final
tomorrow

51
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,269
l can't wear these awful saris
any more

52
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:18,167
The ''heiress'' has spent three years
in the same class

53
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,902
l must have studded boots by tomorrow

54
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,773
He can't afford food, but he makes
demands like a prince

55
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:29,918
Half the month we can't afford
a second course

56
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:34,089
lt's the first of the month -
sister will have been paid

57
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,240
You didn't buy sandals, did you?

58
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,812
l'll buy them later. l bought
material for brother's shirt

59
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:02,554
After all these years... isn't that
Father's pupil Sanat?

60
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,500
Don't you recognize me?

61
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,100
lt's Montu, isn't it?

62
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,640
What are you gawping at?

63
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,714
You've changed so much. You were
only a girl, and now...

64
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,286
-Who?
-Neeta

65
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,866
You write letters, but you don't
come to see us

66
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:54,367
l know that handwriting; l give
those letters to Neeta

67
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:58,537
She's hardly at home, what with
college and tuitions

68
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,640
Let's go home. Ma will be cross

69
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,817
Geeta has grown into quite a beauty

70
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:20,989
A beauty... but she can't afford
decent clothes

71
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:27,034
Neeta, l need some cash to have
the diagrams printed

72
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,236
lt's all gone this month, Sanat

73
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:34,409
l can't even buy my brother and
sister what they ask

74
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:38,877
l know, but l still bring my woes
to you. One feels powerless

75
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,709
lt's your struggle. Can't we share it?

76
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,724
l'll find a way next month

77
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:56,124
Please visit us. Father often
speaks of you

78
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,302
Yes, but only when l've some money

79
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,650
Your spoilt darling will spend it
by the fistful

80
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,520
After all, it's her money

81
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:31,996
The hussy must have spent it all,
my entire month's budget

82
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,766
l ought to give, but l don't.
How can l say no?

83
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:43,845
No sympathy in the whole world,
and no one who'll understand

84
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,979
Khuki, won't you eat?

85
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,342
l'm not feeling well

86
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:23,154
Don't be angry with Ma

87
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:27,986
Deprivation... it's destroyed her mind

88
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,521
l'm not angry

89
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,022
Remember that poem by Yeats, Khuki?

90
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:51,114
A bad headache

91
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,286
Here's another precious prodigy

92
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,390
A god in a devil's clan.
Shear it off

93
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,538
You've bought nice material

94
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,637
Going to bed already? Won't you eat?

95
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,714
Mother must have said something

96
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,718
lgnore what people say. Your motto
should be: Do what you think best

97
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:40,661
Eyes full of tears? They'll fall
at the slightest provocation

98
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,497
l'll utter a spell. All right?

99
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:48,261
-l'm not feeling well
-So l'm uttering it

100
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:59,446
<i>Mother, your girl's such a Khuki.</i>
<i>She wants to catch the moon</i>

101
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:07,118
<i>She can't make out anything</i>

102
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:11,626
<i>She's such a Khuki, mother</i>

103
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:21,232
-A rupee tomorrow, please
-There's nothing left

104
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:25,070
All right, next month, then

105
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,681
Next month it all goes straight to Ma

106
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:33,078
Whoever gives up money
is a full-scale idiot

107
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,860
Where are you going, all dressed up?

108
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:46,091
l couldn't wait till morning
to wear it

109
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,601
Slightly bovine

110
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,684
There's pleasure in practice

111
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,272
New month, very busy right now

112
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,175
Please send last month's bill

113
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:19,620
You'll settle it? What did you want?

114
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,826
Just the bill

115
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,029
Not going to college?

116
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:47,211
Flunking exams for novels and films

117
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:52,016
Everything's scarce in this house,
you don't have anything you need

118
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,689
So create a paradise

119
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,093
Dress like fairies, all of you

120
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:02,126
l'll rest, wriggling my big toe,
in perfumed splendour

121
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:16,677
This year you and Shankar
just have to sing for us

122
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,509
l've given up singing, and Shankar's
maestro won't give him permission

123
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:26,587
But we'll invite lots of guests.
We must talk this over

124
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,122
All right, l'll call in at the
library and see you

125
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,020
Well, how are the rehearsals?

126
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:37,198
Not making much progress

127
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:41,369
Progress indeed!

128
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,155
The tuition money

129
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:05,921
All of it?

130
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:10,500
l asked Banshi to send his bill.
He's so rude every day

131
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,038
Keep five rupees for pocket-money

132
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:26,444
Have you no shame, living off
your old father?

133
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:30,915
The girl works to foot your bills

134
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,748
l'll be earning, too

135
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:40,865
Since the radio audition l get lots
of calls, my maestro's furious

136
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:45,696
He won't let me perform until
l've studied for another two years

137
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:49,462
Hasn't your maestro a hennaed beard?

138
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:54,803
Why not just grab it and hang on
like a midget? Why come here?

139
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:59,047
Does any young man sit at home?

140
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:05,484
My bread doesn't come cheap

141
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:12,488
How can l look people in the eye?
No food for you, unless you pay up

142
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:47,095
-Going off without eating?
-You told Ma l'm a glutton

143
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:52,794
<i>He can't make out anything.</i>
<i>He's such a Khuka, mother</i>

144
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:58,873
Why destroy the future because of
such simple bickering?

145
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:03,670
Grit your teeth and hang on
for two years

146
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,786
Khuki, only you know my worth

147
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:21,664
Going off like that... don't you know
what's on tomorrow?

148
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:25,494
lt's Jagatdhatri Puja

149
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:28,034
lt's your birthday

150
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:31,536
Father's taking me out,
like he used to

151
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,502
Where to?

152
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,341
Anywhere, it's not decided

153
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:41,516
All right. l'll come, too.
Don't tell him

154
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,349
Brother, you're such a child

155
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:48,454
Father would refuse if l told him

156
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:10,871
Sunrise

157
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,904
Didn't Keats have a poem?

158
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:52,118
This flourishing field... it costs
nothing to perceive its beauty

159
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:56,291
There <i>is</i> no money, but this is here

160
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:01,595
Appreciating life is an art

161
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:06,170
Don't overdo it, you'll get
indigestion

162
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,641
Will you always be this greedy?

163
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:16,037
You shouldn't say such things

164
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,743
Anything for us?

165
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:54,518
Sir, your tax is three months overdue

166
00:25:56,821 --> 00:26:02,225
Come tomorrow morning,
l'll see what l can do

167
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:11,198
Aren't you in that group of...

168
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:15,028
l left. l wasn't getting any parts

169
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:19,207
An actor, is it?

170
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:27,208
Who are you?

171
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,747
l'm Sanat, sir

172
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:38,085
You got a good second in pure physics

173
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:43,228
Someone told me... Khuki told me

174
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:47,702
Yes, we meet sometimes

175
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:54,678
What's happened? You're so pale
and drawn

176
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:01,708
What are your plans?

177
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:05,614
l'm looking for a scholarship
to do doctoral research

178
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,118
Monkey!

179
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:14,122
-For a D.Sc?
-D.Phils are all too common

180
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:16,791
Swine!

181
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,207
What's the subject of your thesis?

182
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:29,143
The Reynolds number of the Supersonic
Vibration of the Lower Gangetic Plain

183
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:30,177
Ape!

184
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:37,314
Not you, l mean Shankar.
l was comparing you two

185
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,320
He's done nothing

186
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,683
Son, have a bite to eat

187
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,279
So you're immersed in studies?

188
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:12,782
No other way out in life

189
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,352
What a lovely place

190
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:41,909
l haven't time

191
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,812
Give Sanat some tea

192
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,351
ls Sanat here?

193
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:10,675
What are you staring at?
Take this, l'm late

194
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:17,444
How do you manage to sit indoors
all evening?

195
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:30,224
Drink the tea. l'll go late for
tuition, as you're here

196
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,731
Let's go for a walk

197
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:44,315
A walk, l said. Miles away,
weren't you?

198
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:49,945
Where is everyone?

199
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:57,154
What's this? Get out at once!

200
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,730
Dear me, what's going on?

201
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,930
Come inside

202
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:17,678
You know the guru l told you about

203
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,882
When was that?

204
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:23,783
Bring home all the vagabonds!
Can't feed yourself...

205
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,518
Beginning's a bit troublesome

206
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:36,192
Such a lovely voice.
You'd be spellbound

207
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:39,093
lf you bring such a nuisance again...

208
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,346
Quick, bring some money

209
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:10,426
Don't tell your mother. We're busy.
Lessons to be taught

210
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:37,024
We're going out. l'll do the tuition
on the way back

211
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:06,419
lt won't work. l can't manage
without a job

212
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,988
No, you mustn't

213
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:14,097
But l can't get a scholarship

214
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,659
After so much work

215
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,564
Just a few more months

216
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:21,762
And then?

217
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,942
Then l'll get a job

218
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:28,974
And with your earnings...

219
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:30,510
lt makes no difference

220
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,018
You're so gifted

221
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,398
-That picture in my room...
-The two kids?

222
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,391
Me and Brother

223
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:55,672
Once we went up to the hills

224
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:01,137
We got up before dawn to see the
sunrise from a peak. How hard it was

225
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:06,245
But when the sun came...
l can't explain the thrill

226
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:13,313
Brother used to tease me:
''She wants to catch the moon''

227
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,486
He still teases me

228
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:21,992
Neeta, you're just not cut out
to endure all this

229
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:30,899
Then keep me in a glass case,
like a wax doll

230
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:38,272
l'll be late for tuition

231
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:14,718
That's why l come to you,
you make my worries vanish

232
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:01,120
No cause for alarm, just a broken bone

233
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,996
Neeta, a word with you

234
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:12,973
Such an injury in old age...
it'll take long to mend

235
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:17,739
You'll have to run the household
from now on

236
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:22,543
l'll give a sedative,
it'll last until morning

237
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,742
What brings you here? Weren't you
finishing your studies this year?

238
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:57,880
l couldn't. l've had to take a job

239
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,649
You'd better spin a new yarn
about your rent

240
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:37,310
-l said yesterday...
-''You'll get it as soon as l do''

241
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:43,052
Do you take us for your benefactor,
to rest on our shoulder?

242
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:47,524
Why not get a job? Settle down in life

243
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:56,765
You'll never understand suffering
for an ideal

244
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:04,109
l asked your friend Saroj
what could be done about it

245
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:05,779
What did he say?

246
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:14,056
National Chemical, Joy Engineering,
Jagat Hosiery

247
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:19,192
Three jobs just waiting for you...

248
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:23,322
...and you're researching hot air
in the atmosphere

249
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,627
Sir, the lady's here

250
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:31,038
Your ideal is here

251
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:12,241
What a time l've had.
Luckily, l got a job

252
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:21,622
The way things are after
Father's accident...

253
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,694
l can't say l like it.
Why abandon your studies?

254
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,897
What can l do?

255
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:38,231
So many at home, all counting on me

256
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:44,144
Walk me to the station

257
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:58,654
<i>Praise to the Goddess of Learning,</i>
<i>bestower of perseverance</i>

258
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:51,478
And four annas for me, for a shave

259
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:11,324
<i>Goddess of Learning,</i>
<i>Mother of the Universe</i>

260
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:10,159
lt will be unbearable if l do research
while you work

261
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:17,494
l'll work and you study.
l can easily get a job

262
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:23,003
Then our wedding...

263
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:26,436
Can't happen now

264
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:33,873
How can it? lf l leave the household...

265
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,846
My father, brothers and sister...

266
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:41,252
Shankar's a rascal, why support him?

267
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:44,117
You don't understand him at all

268
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:50,791
One day he will be big,
and you will, too

269
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,237
l pin my hopes on both of you

270
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:00,704
Then my time will come

271
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:04,541
That means, until then...

272
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:07,540
We must wait

273
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,681
Why should we wait?

274
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,262
Don't be silly

275
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:31,840
l'll drop by in a day or two

276
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,278
l have a question

277
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,585
Come along

278
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:14,643
A singer can certainly afford a shave

279
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:19,152
Have you shorn off your sense
of shame, too?

280
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:20,823
What shame?

281
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:24,893
The lot of you living off one sister,
destroying her future

282
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:29,691
Everyone's talking about it.
Aren't you the elder brother?

283
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:35,235
Banshi, just because you give credit
it doesn't mean you can criticize

284
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:42,175
l call Neeta ''Sinbad the Sailor''

285
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,010
They're all on her shoulders,
like the old man of the sea

286
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:51,115
That'll be her fate until
she drops dead

287
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:07,467
<i>Wasting all my days</i>

288
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:27,920
<i>l've come to the river at a bad time.</i>
<i>l don't know your name, boatman</i>

289
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:41,363
<i>Who shall l call out to?</i>

290
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:52,844
<i>Who will row me across?</i>

291
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:04,389
<i>The boat is here, but no boatman</i>

292
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:11,464
<i>Not a soul to be seen</i>

293
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:50,438
Sir, l've finished the lesson

294
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:58,110
lt's late. You'd better go home, son

295
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:11,287
Montu has skipped college for a month.
l heard today that he's failed

296
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:21,834
He's been struck off the roll because
he couldn't pay the fees

297
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:27,904
What good would college do him,
anyway?

298
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,043
lt's just as well that girl has a job

299
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:43,658
Father, do you know about Montu?

300
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:48,091
No need to tell me. Bad news
travels fast

301
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:51,856
Everyone knows you're the happiest
to see us harmed

302
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:56,370
You and your young man

303
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:57,969
Wife!

304
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:08,782
Because he's known as a sportsman,
Montu's been given a factory job

305
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:16,524
He was frightened to tell you.
He's brought home his first pay

306
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:21,987
Everything's kept secret from me,
as if l were an enemy

307
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:25,199
Like father, like children

308
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:30,632
l won't touch this money. You can
run the household and face the music

309
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:43,483
A job in a factory? Labour!

310
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:53,954
So what? These jobs have better
prospects nowadays

311
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:59,759
See what the middle classes
have sunk to?

312
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:07,108
Help me into the next room

313
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:26,619
You all think l just pick fault

314
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:34,629
Time has taken a heavy toll
of my mind and spirit

315
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:39,740
Something's come over me

316
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:42,973
You needn't explain, Ma

317
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:48,717
l can't take the burden of this
household any more. Set me free

318
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:55,158
lf Shankar had been a man, you
wouldn't have to shoulder the burden

319
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:58,054
Brother is very nice

320
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:06,661
Don't count on your father any more.
Maybe he will stand and walk again

321
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:13,834
But l think his mind is
becoming confused

322
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:22,347
He won't be able to earn again.
l've known him since l was seven

323
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:28,447
Don't worry, Ma... l'm here

324
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:33,256
You, too, have your hopes...
lots of things, l expect

325
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:35,795
Anyway, you're all l have

326
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:44,773
Yes, but l can't help thinking

327
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:48,543
You're my sole support...
that's the truth

328
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:53,038
But even you scare me

329
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:59,751
My own daughter, yet l don't know you

330
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:07,160
What if you go away, too?

331
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:14,829
l still don't know you

332
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:52,065
-Oh, it's you
-Just listening

333
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:03,307
-What is it?
-Come and eat, it's late

334
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,083
-Why haven't you eaten?
-Because you haven't eaten

335
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:20,258
l bother you all the time, don't l?

336
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:24,094
-How sentimental
-Not really

337
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:29,862
Your whole future... your marriage...

338
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,069
People are turning nasty

339
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:35,935
lt hurts your manhood?

340
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:40,743
-Haven't you an ego?
-Something much bigger: my music

341
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:45,243
Right now l'm exploiting you

342
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:50,288
But deep down it really disturbs me

343
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,791
Are you serious?

344
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:59,795
l love you all to distraction

345
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:03,802
We all love each other,
but we shy from saying so

346
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:15,644
lf anyone else loves me,
he'll surely wait for me

347
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:19,647
lt doesn't worry me

348
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,028
l won't marry right now

349
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:35,997
l'll marry when you become
really famous

350
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:40,904
Won't l survive until then?

351
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:47,843
All my suffering will vanish then

352
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:52,381
Don't you vanish, too

353
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:10,635
Will you take me to the hills then?
''She's such a Khuki, mother''

354
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:22,215
l will. You're such a child

355
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:51,271
<i>Banish sadness and poverty,</i>
<i>bring happiness to all</i>

356
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:59,618
<i>Sadarang makes a plea</i>

357
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:07,892
<i>O Being! l shall worship You,</i>
<i>Supreme Being</i>

358
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:48,837
What have you done to yourself?

359
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:53,972
Don't fall. l spoke like Father

360
00:56:57,514 --> 00:57:00,381
Why haven't you come for so long?

361
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:02,617
l can't seem to make it

362
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:08,256
-The question you were going to ask?
-l don't feel the need

363
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:41,345
l'll be back after tuition
