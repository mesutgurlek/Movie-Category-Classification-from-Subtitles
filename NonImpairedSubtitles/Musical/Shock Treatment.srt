1
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:41,166
<i>Once upon a time,
in a town not far from yours...</i>

2
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:44,233
<i>there lived a real fast guy.</i>

3
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,246
<i>His life was fast.
His friends were fast.</i>

4
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:51,511
<i>Even his food was fast.</i>

5
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:54,781
<i>But he was still
not satisfied.</i>

6
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:57,448
<i>He wanted to share
his fast philosophy...</i>

7
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:00,254
<i>with someone else-</i>

8
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,794
<i>a beautiful girl.</i>

9
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:06,696
<i>The trouble was
she was in the arms of...</i>

10
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:09,064
<i>another man.</i>

11
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,002
Whoops!

12
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,107
<i>Good luck, honey.</i>

13
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,500
- What are we gonna do, Janet?
- It's all right, Brad.

14
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,938
Everything's gonna be
all right.

15
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:37,940
You'll find happy hearts

16
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:40,611
And smiling faces

17
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,349
And tolerance for

18
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:46,221
The ethnic races

19
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,726
In Denton

20
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:54,359
You'll find
a ramblin' rose

21
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,096
And a picket fence

22
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,138
Tenderness

23
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:02,470
And innocence

24
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,703
In Denton

25
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,446
You'll find
conference rooms

26
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,382
And a children's playground

27
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:16,479
Denton is a real
okay town

28
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:20,322
Civic pride
and civic duty

29
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,021
And Denton girls are

30
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,966
Full of beauty

31
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,300
You may call us
the goody-goody two shoes

32
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:36,001
We're here to cheer you
with the good news

33
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,873

34
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,675

That's ten out of ten

35
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,717
If you're looking

You're gonna get
a whole lot to please ya

37
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,021

38
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,250
And again

39
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,552
Denton, Denton

40
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,620
You've got no pretension

41
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:04,295
You're where the heart is
You're okay

42
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,702
Denton, Denton

43
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,867
I'd just like to mention

44
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,740
You're the home of youth

45
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,474
You're America's truth

46
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:20,611
You're Denton
Denton, U.S.A.

47
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,087
This is the mecca
of America

48
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,852
The Bethlehem
of the West

49
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,894
This is the birthplace
of the virtuous

50
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,395
The home of happiness

51
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,867
Leisure-wise
we're sure you will adapt

52
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,426
Enjoy your stay
Have a happy holiday

53
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:44,465
And we'll all put Denton
Denton on the map

54
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,535
Denton, Denton

55
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,604
You've got no pretension

56
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:54,642
You're where the heart is
You're okay

57
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,788
Denton, Denton

58
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,951
I'd just like to mention

59
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,962
You're the home of youth

60
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,897
You're America's truth

61
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:11,494
You're Denton
Denton, U.S.A.

62
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,930
Denton, Denton

63
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:18,033
You've got no pretension

64
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:23,811
You're where the heart is
You're okay

65
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,317
Denton, Denton

66
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,549
I'd just like to mention

67
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:33,251
You're the acceptable face

68
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,453
Of the human race

69
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:41,831
You're Denton
Denton, U.S.A.

70
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,768
Well, how about that?

71
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,101
Wasn't that terrific?

72
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,300
And now for,
well, certainly...

73
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,071
my favorite part of the show...

74
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,581
<i>- and I sincerely hope yours at home.
- Get the whole crowd.</i>

75
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,878
<i>- Our regular in-depth discussion...
- Dressing room. Right here.</i>

76
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,384
with Judge Oliver Wright...

77
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:05,350
<i>Denton's leading
social scientist.</i>

78
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,359
- Judge Wright?
- Mm-hmm.

79
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:11,158
Did you enjoy
our anthem?

80
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,391
In a way.

81
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,162
I detect a note
of reticence.

82
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,533
Are you perhaps
one of those amongst us...

83
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:23,974
who feel this emotive form of presentation
is overly manipulative?

84
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,705
Well, Betty,
there are many ways...

85
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,805
that the spider
may catch the fly.

86
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,180
There are
monetary inducements.

87
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,743
<i>- Hi, Brad. Hi, Janet. Come for Marriage Maze?
- Extortion.</i>

88
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,312
Seduction.

89
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,087
I'm exhausted working on this documentary
for Farley's new show.

90
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,491
<i>- Hmm?
- Blackmail.</i>

91
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,860
- Farley Flavors, our new sponsor.
- Oh.

92
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,922
<i>- Whoo.
- Prejudice.</i>

93
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:50,332
I tell you, Janet,
that guy's as close as we'll come...

94
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,701
to a successful man
in this town.

95
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:56,606
<i>- And lies.
- Thank you, Judge Oliver Wright.</i>

96
00:07:56,676 --> 00:08:00,612
And now for
a commercial break.

97
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:07,676
<i>Okay, kids, let's hear
the five F's for today.</i>

98
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,744
- "F" for-
- Farley!

99
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,915
- "F" for-
- Flavors!

100
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,856
- "F" for-
- Fabulous!

101
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,587
- "F" for-
- Fast!

102
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,424
- And "F" for-
- Five!

103
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,003
<i>First and foremost...</i>

104
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,062
<i>Farley Flavors'
fabulous fast foods...</i>

105
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:31,303
<i>feed and fortify families
for a fabulous future.</i>

106
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:34,346
<i>Stand by for Marriage Maze.
Strike Denton Dossier.</i>

107
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,940
Thank you so much, Judge Wright,
for another wonderful interview.

108
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:42,044
Judge Wright? Oh, come on, Betty.
First names surely.

109
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,716
Oh. Oliver. You're so tolerant.

110
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,225
Time for a coffee break
before you rush off?

111
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:52,788
I'd love to, that is if you don't mind
being seen with an older man.

112
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,924
Why, Oliver.

113
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:59,597
Since Ralph and I separated,
maturity is something I look for in a man.

114
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,142
- Hi, Ollie.
- Hi, Betty.

115
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,405
<i>- Hi, Betty.
- Hello, Neely.</i>

116
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,504
You keep up that
high standard of interview...

117
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,641
and I'm gonna have to include you
in Farley's documentary.

118
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,948
You're so probing.

119
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,955
A free thinker.

120
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,218
Everything's free there.

121
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,662
<i>- Hi, Betty. The usual?
- Plus one.</i>

122
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,131
<i>There you go. Hi, Max. Hey, you gonna
be watching Marriage Maze?</i>

123
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,931
- Sure am. This could be Bert Schnick's finest hour.
- Yeah.

124
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,938
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

125
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:38,773
<i>- This could be a major step forward for him.
- Yeah, a leap in the dark.</i>

126
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,404
I better go check on the Bert.
Otherwise-

127
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,607
- Right.
- Good luck.

128
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,808
<i>Okay.</i>

129
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,251
<i>And here to bring yourjust desserts...</i>

130
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,551

133

<i>Marriage Maze host,
Bert Schnick.</i>

134
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,732
<i>Three seconds.</i>

135
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:14,810
- Hoopla, Denton!
- Hoopla, Bert!

136
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,785
Thank you. Welcome.
Thank you.

137
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:29,021
Before we start I want to say one or two words
about tomorrow night's great new show...

138
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,029
<i>The Faith Factory Sh-</i>

139
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:36,330
<i>And as a matter of fact,
we have in the studio audience tonight...</i>

140
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,666
the host
and his lovely cohost.

141
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,969
Give a big hand, please,
to Ralph Hapschatt...

142
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,101
and the vivacious
Macy Struthers.

143
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,008
Hey, Ralph!

144
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,943
Let's get a camera in there
for heaven's sake.

145
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,423
<i>- Over the moon about that commercial, Macy.
- Thanks, Bert.</i>

146
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,426
Got a good show lined up
for us tomorrow night, Ralph?

147
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,689
You bet, Bert!

148
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:08,632
Good! I'm gonna be there!
Ain't we all, viewers?

149
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:12,364
<i>Macy Struthers with my husband.
God, I must've been blind.</i>

150
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:16,738
Still, the weaker the man,
the dumber the blonde.

151
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:20,210
Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors
sitting in the audience there?

152
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,543
<i>What an ideal couple they are.</i>

153
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:26,142
<i>You know more than anyone else in Denton,
they represent the old values.</i>

154
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,584
Ike would have
been proud of them.

155
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:33,591
And now, would the first couple who seem
to have made a hash of their marriage...

156
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,891
and cooked their goose,
step this way, please!

157
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:41,228
- You!
- That's us, Brad.

158
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,066
Come on. What's cooking up there?
Come on down, you guys.

159
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,435
Let's feel you.

160
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:51,636
- I'm not going, Janet.
- You've got to. Everyone's watching.

161
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:07,356
Face the cameras.
Face the cameras.

162
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,394
Now introduce yourselves.

163
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,488
- My name is Brad-
- I am Janet- Oh. Sorry.

164
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,661
I'm Janet Majors,
and this is my husband Brad.

165
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:21,366
Hey, Brad, we've been hearing some
bad things about you. Haven't we, Janet?

166
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,672
- Haven't we, Janet?
- Uh, yes, he needs help.

167
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,841
Help? Let's face it, Janet.

168
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,282
Brad's an emotional cripple.

169
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,518
<i>I know, I know.</i>

170
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:44,791
It looks like Rest Home for
this stupid old marriage, eh?

171
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,669
<i>Tell me, Janet.
Do you watch Dentonvale?</i>

172
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:57,368
Uh, yes, I've caught it
once or twice.

173
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,469
That's right. DTV's
most popular hospital series...

174
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,242
featuring those perennial favorites,
Nation and Cosmo McKinley.

175
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:06,079
<i>Neuro-specialists
par excellence.</i>

176
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,245
I recommend, if you
pardon my French, Janet...

177
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,551
<i>that you send Brad
to them for treatment.</i>

178
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:16,755
Oh, uh, well, I know he's a little boring,
but neuro-specialists.

179
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:22,529
<i>- That sounds a little drastic.
- It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet.</i>

180
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,899
We have to cut quick and deep.

181
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,735
McKinley? McKinley?

182
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,870
- Bert brought them over from Europe.
- Oh?

183
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,541
They had a very popular series together.
It's still rerun in a lot of countries.

184
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:42,110
<i>- You must have seen them in Dentonvale?
- No, I never watch that.</i>

185
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:46,056
I'm afraid there's only one
solution. Isn't there, folks?

186
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,923
One, two, three.

187
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,588
Dentonvale!

188
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,990
Hoopla!
Don't go away!

189
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,798
We'll be right back to see
if Brad and Janet want to play or pass.

190
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,782
Great.

191
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,217
Congratulations. I think
you've made a wise decision.

192
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,948
- But- But l-
- Janet?

193
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,923
- I'm not going.
- What do you mean, you're not going?

194
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,324
You'll ruin the show.
Bert's made all the arrangements.

195
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,794
But I don't
need treatment.

196
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:29,091
<i>But you do need glasses, eh, stupid?</i>

197
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,659
Doesn't he?

198
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:44,780
I am sick of being humiliated by you!
Bert's right. You're going.

199
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,752
<i>It looks like Brad
and Janet Majors have a big decision to make.</i>

200
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,415
<i>Here's some more prizes
to amaze here on Marriage Maze.</i>

Bitchin' in the kitchen
or crying in the bedroom all night

Living on a knife edge?

209
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,486
- Dear knife drawer
- Stay sharp with this keen knife.

210

Bitchin' in the kitchen

Everything used

00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,142
But I've been had

218

- Hey, Bert.
- Hey, Ricky.

234

I've come for Mr. Majors.

235
00:16:57,011 --> 00:17:01,778
Brad will learn how to care
in the surgical chair.

236
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:09,115
- Nothing serious, I hope?
- Oh, no. Just a routine checkup.

237
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:13,388
Just a routine checkup,
eh, viewers?

238
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,825
<i>Come in.</i>

<i>Well, Bert's done it again.</i>

243
00:17:38,652 --> 00:17:41,348
<i>Another rocky marriage
is headed for intensive care.</i>

244
00:17:41,422 --> 00:17:43,856
The subject is committed.

245
00:17:46,427 --> 00:17:48,486
As are we all.

246
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:51,793
<i>Dentonvale.</i>

247
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:55,700
<i>The Arrival.
Introducing Brad and Janet Majors.</i>

248
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,672
Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Majors.
How wonderful to see you.

249
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,140
I'm Doctor Cosmo McKinley...

250
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:05,144
and this is my sister
and colleague...

251
00:18:05,212 --> 00:18:08,045
Dr. Nation McKinley.

252
00:18:08,115 --> 00:18:11,812
<i>We understand you've been
going through a rather trying time.</i>

253
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:13,820
Well, yes, we have.

254
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:16,379
Now listen. There's-
There's nothing really wrong with me.

255
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:18,687
Janet and I haven't
been getting along too well lately...

256
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:22,058
and I've had a little-
a little trouble-

257
00:18:24,865 --> 00:18:27,857
- Oh, Brad.
- Ooh.

258
00:18:27,935 --> 00:18:30,802
- Does he do this often?
- No, he's never done this before.

259
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:32,896
Good.
Then there's still hope.

260
00:18:32,973 --> 00:18:35,100
Lots and lots of hope.

261
00:18:35,176 --> 00:18:37,508
<i>If anyone can help Brad, we can.</i>

262
00:18:37,578 --> 00:18:40,479
<i>- Well, he does need help.
- Nurse Ansalong, you've arrived.</i>

263
00:18:40,548 --> 00:18:44,985
- Oh, that was real short notice because the
other models- - Attend to Mr. Majors, Nurse.

264
00:18:45,052 --> 00:18:48,749
There are just one or two formalities
that have to be dealt with, Mrs. Majors.

265
00:18:48,823 --> 00:18:51,724
A contract to be signed.

266
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:53,953
Oh, could I do that
later, please?

267
00:18:54,028 --> 00:18:56,258
<i>Of course you can, Mrs. Majors.</i>

268
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:02,835
Sign the contract tomorrow.

269
00:19:02,903 --> 00:19:07,135
Ouch! Mrs. Majors.
Just one or two details.

270
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:11,440
Does Brad have any living relatives-
any blood relatives?

271
00:19:11,512 --> 00:19:15,710
- No, he doesn't. Could I take care of this later?
- Of course.

272
00:19:17,518 --> 00:19:20,282
Why did you tell me
not to sign now?

273
00:19:20,354 --> 00:19:24,791
Well, that way you
get the first day free.

274
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:34,900
<i>Here's Bert, that eternal showbiz wiz...</i>

<i>with a family connection

276
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,867
As Janet's parents,
this should be really easy.

277
00:19:42,943 --> 00:19:45,241
About Brad's family?

278
00:19:45,312 --> 00:19:48,110
Your last clue is...

279
00:19:48,182 --> 00:19:51,208
mental instability.

280
00:19:51,285 --> 00:19:54,220
<i>You have 30 seconds.</i>

281
00:19:54,288 --> 00:19:57,485
Mental instability?

282
00:19:57,558 --> 00:20:01,551
- He was adopted, you know.
- Oh, yeah. I'd forgotten.

283
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:05,087
Well, I hadn't. I was worried about inherited
craziness when they married.

284
00:20:05,165 --> 00:20:08,828
I said toJanet,
"What do we know of his parents?"

285
00:20:08,903 --> 00:20:12,669
<i>- Which leads us to-
This afternoon's surprise prize, Bert...</i>

290
00:20:28,989 --> 00:20:30,650

294
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:47,534
Aha.

00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:51,339
I got it! I got it!

296
00:20:51,412 --> 00:20:54,142
She got it! She got it!

297
00:20:54,214 --> 00:20:57,274
In one.
Infantile regression.

298
00:20:57,351 --> 00:20:59,979
Our speciality!

299
00:21:00,054 --> 00:21:04,957
- Your speciality.
- I can't wait to begin on him.

300
00:21:05,025 --> 00:21:07,255
Really, Bert, I don't know what
we'd do without you.

301
00:21:07,328 --> 00:21:09,592
I must confess...

302
00:21:09,663 --> 00:21:14,259
the decision to have Brad committed
was not strictly my own.

303
00:21:14,335 --> 00:21:16,269
No, of course.
There's Janet.

304
00:21:16,337 --> 00:21:20,068
But if she was
so keen on getting him in here...

305
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,233
why wouldn't she sign
the contract?

306
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:25,642
No, it wasn'tJanet
exactly.

307
00:21:25,713 --> 00:21:30,582
- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
- Sponsor?

308
00:21:30,651 --> 00:21:34,348
<i>- Dentonvale has been sold.
- Sold?</i>

309
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:36,480
Dear old Bert's
settled everything.

310
00:21:36,557 --> 00:21:39,219
<i>Ja, you endorse
his Faith Factory...</i>

311
00:21:39,293 --> 00:21:43,024
- and he endorses your research.
- He?

312
00:21:43,097 --> 00:21:47,227
How dare this person take
advantage of my weakness!

313
00:21:47,301 --> 00:21:51,829
I don't think he intends
to go that far.

314
00:22:00,447 --> 00:22:02,381
If only you knew

315
00:22:02,449 --> 00:22:07,512
How to win some prizes

316
00:22:07,588 --> 00:22:09,522
If only you knew

317
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,890
How to play

318
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:18,057
<i>If you could sleep nights</i>

319
00:22:18,132 --> 00:22:20,498
And stop your crying

320
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:23,593
Then you might find out
I still love you

321
00:22:23,671 --> 00:22:27,368
In my own way

322
00:22:28,942 --> 00:22:32,139
If that's not enough
then I'm

323
00:22:32,212 --> 00:22:34,680
So sorry I met you

324
00:22:34,748 --> 00:22:36,807
It was almost like

325
00:22:36,884 --> 00:22:42,754
Leading you on

326
00:22:42,823 --> 00:22:46,281
But there's more
to it all

327
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,990
Than just wringing your heart out
over something

328
00:22:51,065 --> 00:22:56,901
That keeps on
going wrong

329
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:00,462
So don't tell me
you love me

330
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:07,310
How am I supposed to know
what that means

331
00:23:07,381 --> 00:23:10,077
<i>No, don't sell emotion</i>

332
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,414
<i>You can't buy devotion</i>

333
00:23:12,486 --> 00:23:18,083
<i>If you're falling apart
at the seams</i>

334
00:23:18,158 --> 00:23:21,389
I hope that
you'll smile when you

335
00:23:21,462 --> 00:23:24,920
Reach your conclusion

336
00:23:24,998 --> 00:23:31,927
I hope that you'll know
just what to say

337
00:23:32,005 --> 00:23:35,270
But if it should mean

338
00:23:35,342 --> 00:23:37,970
That the party is over

339
00:23:38,045 --> 00:23:41,947
You should know
that I still love you

340
00:23:42,015 --> 00:23:44,984
You should know that
I still love you

341
00:23:45,052 --> 00:23:50,115
You should know
that I still love you

342
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,420
In my own way

343
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,094
In my own way

344
00:23:57,197 --> 00:23:59,791
In my own way

345
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:02,199
In my own way

346
00:24:03,837 --> 00:24:06,397
- Oh, my poor baby.
- Oh, Mom, it's Brad.

347
00:24:06,473 --> 00:24:10,432
I know. I know, baby.
He's gonna get all the help he needs.

348
00:24:10,511 --> 00:24:14,470
- But in the meantime, look. For you.
- What is it?

349
00:24:14,548 --> 00:24:16,709
They call it a new look
at an old favorite.

350
00:24:16,784 --> 00:24:19,150
<i>I copied it from
The Window on the World show.</i>

351
00:24:19,219 --> 00:24:21,881
- The Far East meets the Midwest.
- Mom-

352
00:24:21,955 --> 00:24:24,389
It's just what
the doctor ordered, I know.

353
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:27,825
- Come on in. My favorite show's just started.
- What show?

354
00:24:27,895 --> 00:24:30,659
<i>Dentonvale.</i>

355
00:24:43,911 --> 00:24:46,106
<i>Love starts in the home...</i>

356
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,207
<i>and where better to
find this than in today's Happy Homes.</i>

357
00:24:50,284 --> 00:24:54,414
With guest star,
Janet Majors.

358
00:24:54,488 --> 00:24:57,980
<i>If you're sick ofhaving
the goodness boiled away out of your coffee...</i>

359
00:24:58,058 --> 00:25:02,461
<i>replace that old perk of yours with
a coffeemaker of prestigious distinction.</i>

360
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:06,932
<i>And be the envy of all
with a coffeemaker that says it all.</i>

361
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,594
<i>Oh, thanks.</i>

362
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:14,630
<i>When that man of yours comes in from
the big outdoors with a burning thirst...</i>

363
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:17,302
<i>that only Lake Michigan
could satisfy...</i>

364
00:25:17,377 --> 00:25:23,247
<i>make sure there's a cold can
of Krautmeister Light in the icebox.</i>

365
00:25:23,317 --> 00:25:25,478
<i>He'll thank you for it.</i>

366
00:25:25,552 --> 00:25:29,283
<i>And he'll thank Krautmeister.</i>

367
00:25:29,356 --> 00:25:33,156
For crying out loud, Emily.
Leave her alone. She's not a kid.

368
00:25:33,227 --> 00:25:36,458
- Well, I wanted to see her in it.
- It's really very nice.

369
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:39,363
The material is imported.
Taiwanese.

370
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:42,163
Damn it, Emily.
She's not interested.

371
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:44,397
What are you trying to do,
Harry, start an argument?

372
00:25:44,471 --> 00:25:46,405
Don't you want your daughter
to look pretty?

373
00:25:46,473 --> 00:25:48,407
Who's she got
to look pretty for?

374
00:25:48,475 --> 00:25:50,807
- She's got a husband.
- She's got a weirdo!

375
00:25:50,878 --> 00:25:55,076
I've never been able to afford the time
to have a nervous breakdown!

376
00:25:55,148 --> 00:25:58,640
- Oh, poor Brad.
- Thank God he was born an orphan.

377
00:25:58,719 --> 00:26:01,620
It would have killed
his parents.

378
00:26:01,688 --> 00:26:05,283
And thank goodness he hasn't ended up
like that Slepstrini boy.

379
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,523
What are you talking about?
Danny Slepstrini's a chip off the old block.

380
00:26:09,596 --> 00:26:12,064
I played 18 holes of golf
with his father just last week...

381
00:26:12,132 --> 00:26:16,193
and Hank says that Danny's moved
to New York to... better himself.

382
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,500
He moved, all right...

383
00:26:18,572 --> 00:26:23,032
when they found him at the back of
Wilson's Bakery... naked...

384
00:26:24,111 --> 00:26:27,046
with 15 other men.

385
00:26:27,114 --> 00:26:29,605
Mexicans.

386
00:26:38,692 --> 00:26:42,856
I'm gonna catch up on a few jobs
that need doing outside!

387
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:47,959
- You shouldn't have said that.
- But why?

388
00:26:48,035 --> 00:26:50,333
Your father doesn't
like Mexicans.

389
00:26:50,404 --> 00:26:52,634
<i>Your father doesn't
like Mexicans.</i>

390
00:26:59,947 --> 00:27:02,245
A man should
call the toss

391
00:27:02,316 --> 00:27:04,750
Wear the pants
and be the boss

392
00:27:04,818 --> 00:27:06,979
A man should be
the drake

393
00:27:07,054 --> 00:27:09,386
For his own damned sake

394
00:27:09,456 --> 00:27:11,686
And men should be
the misters

395
00:27:11,758 --> 00:27:14,226
And the masters
of their sisters

396
00:27:14,294 --> 00:27:16,228
A man should be
the reason

397
00:27:16,296 --> 00:27:18,264
For a heart to break

398
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,492
So be moral
Don't quarrel

399
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,801
Fair and square is best

400
00:27:26,873 --> 00:27:30,138
Let me alert you
that virtue

401
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,440
Won't hurt you
or desert you

402
00:27:32,512 --> 00:27:36,915
If you wear hair
on your chest

403
00:27:36,984 --> 00:27:41,751
So always remember
to follow the rules

404
00:27:41,822 --> 00:27:44,290
- Box clever
- Jocks never

405
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:47,156
Hock another jock's tools

406
00:27:50,864 --> 00:27:54,595
A man should wax a car
Fix a fuse and tend a bar

407
00:27:54,668 --> 00:27:59,071
A man should like his brow
to be wet with sweat

408
00:27:59,139 --> 00:28:01,539
And should know
the right occasions

409
00:28:01,608 --> 00:28:04,338
To indulge in tax evasions

410
00:28:04,411 --> 00:28:08,438
A man should know the settings
that his spark plugs get

411
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:12,318
Faggots are maggots

412
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:19,451
Thank God I'm a man

413
00:28:31,304 --> 00:28:33,238
What a meal!

414
00:28:33,306 --> 00:28:38,005
<i>Scrumptious, meine Liebling.
I insist on the recipe.</i>

415
00:28:38,078 --> 00:28:41,946
Coming from a gourmet,
that's praise indeed. But... secrets.

416
00:28:42,015 --> 00:28:44,506
Oh.

417
00:28:44,584 --> 00:28:48,315
With Fast-Food Farley at the helm,
it'll probably be TV dinners from now on.

418
00:28:48,388 --> 00:28:53,917
<i>Farley is already
a TVwinner as we shall see.</i>

419
00:28:55,862 --> 00:28:58,922
<i>Dentonvale will run forever
now that his interest...</i>

420
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:01,797
has embraced mental hygiene.

421
00:29:01,868 --> 00:29:03,927
Our field.

422
00:29:04,004 --> 00:29:07,201
I'm convinced there's
some kind of conspiracy.

423
00:29:07,274 --> 00:29:09,367
- Conspiracy?
- Mm-hmm.

424
00:29:09,443 --> 00:29:11,741
Well, that sounds
a little far-fetched.

425
00:29:11,812 --> 00:29:14,713
Oh, I don't know.
Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?

426
00:29:14,781 --> 00:29:17,477
He disappeared into that underworld series
and never came back.

427
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:19,985
<i>Sounds like my husband.
He never came back either.</i>

428
00:29:20,053 --> 00:29:23,454
Not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.

429
00:29:23,523 --> 00:29:26,549
Oh, yes, Farley Flavors.
You know, I find it remarkable...

430
00:29:26,626 --> 00:29:31,427
<i>that his Faith Factory is being financed
by an entire nation's indigestion.</i>

431
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:38,030
Who do you think gave
you the next episode?

432
00:29:38,105 --> 00:29:41,370
So thatJanet will
be free to front line...

433
00:29:41,441 --> 00:29:43,375
<i>the new Faith Factory show.</i>

434
00:29:43,443 --> 00:29:46,469
- We're the experts.
- Who trusts experts?

435
00:29:46,546 --> 00:29:48,673
WhyJanet?

436
00:29:48,748 --> 00:29:52,707
Everyone loves
the girl next door.

437
00:29:55,222 --> 00:29:57,156
Particularly Farley.

438
00:29:59,421 --> 00:30:01,821
So it seems.

439
00:30:11,733 --> 00:30:14,065
Come in.

440
00:30:14,136 --> 00:30:16,434
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

441
00:30:16,505 --> 00:30:18,837
- Hi.
- I just came to give you this.

442
00:30:18,907 --> 00:30:21,171
- Thank you.
- Hi!

443
00:30:21,243 --> 00:30:23,177
- Hi.
- Hi.

444
00:30:23,245 --> 00:30:26,737
We'd better get going.
Tomorrow's the big one, and Farley expects.

445
00:30:26,815 --> 00:30:28,612
Oh, you bet.

446
00:30:28,684 --> 00:30:33,053
- I guess we'd better leave you young things to it.
- Good-bye.

447
00:30:33,121 --> 00:30:35,453
- Bye.
- Bye.

448
00:30:41,997 --> 00:30:44,465
- Oh, Ralph.
- Yeah?

449
00:30:44,533 --> 00:30:48,833
- Shove it!
- Oh, you shove it too, Betty!

450
00:30:48,904 --> 00:30:52,635
Alimony is just
another word for rape.

451
00:30:56,311 --> 00:30:59,337
Conspiracy is right.

452
00:30:59,414 --> 00:31:02,611
<i>- The Denton Dossier is-
- Closed.</i>

453
00:31:06,555 --> 00:31:08,716
<i>Dentonvale.</i>

454
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:12,487
<i>Special guest star,
Janet Majors.</i>

455
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:15,928
- Janet!
- I've come to see Brad.

456
00:31:15,997 --> 00:31:19,694
<i>That's out of the question.
He's sleeping like a baby.</i>

457
00:31:19,768 --> 00:31:23,966
- It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
- Yes, Janet, how are you?

458
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:28,066
<i>- Are you happy?
- Oh, I'm happy.</i>

459
00:31:28,143 --> 00:31:30,941
There are countless people
in this world, Janet...

460
00:31:31,012 --> 00:31:33,674
who believe
that they're happy.

461
00:31:33,749 --> 00:31:35,740
But they only think
they're happy.

462
00:31:35,817 --> 00:31:38,980
Oh, well, that doesn't
make any sense.

463
00:31:42,157 --> 00:31:45,217
<i>This might, Janet.</i>

464
00:31:47,662 --> 00:31:52,190
And a big Denton welcome
to my new delegation.

465
00:31:52,267 --> 00:31:57,136
This is Farley
and I'm here with the score.

466
00:31:57,205 --> 00:32:00,834
We're going to package
and sell some mental health to the nation...

467
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:04,470
with my dream
of the girl next door.

468
00:32:06,748 --> 00:32:10,343
Oh, why aren't they doing
tomorrow's new dance steps

469
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:13,855
The way they used
to yesterday

470
00:32:13,922 --> 00:32:17,949
And who draws
a perfect circle anymore

471
00:32:20,028 --> 00:32:23,259
And if you're waiting for greatness
to shake hands with you

472
00:32:23,331 --> 00:32:27,165
You'd better daydream
your life away

473
00:32:27,235 --> 00:32:32,537
<i>I've only wanted one thing
and that's for sure</i>

474
00:32:33,942 --> 00:32:37,173
You're not just looking
at a fast-food king

475
00:32:37,245 --> 00:32:40,408
Just another
well-known face

476
00:32:40,482 --> 00:32:44,885
You're not looking
at the king of anything

477
00:32:46,721 --> 00:32:49,986
I'm gonna shoot for the moon
I'm gonna play high noon

478
00:32:50,058 --> 00:32:53,858
I'm gonna take on
the entire human race

479
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:57,922
You're not looking
at a king

480
00:32:57,999 --> 00:33:00,866
You're looking at an ace

481
00:33:04,573 --> 00:33:08,304
Ooh, I got sight
and I've seen the light

482
00:33:08,376 --> 00:33:11,743
And I'm gonna see
the coming day

483
00:33:11,813 --> 00:33:14,543
<i>When the sun in the sky
is a spotlight</i>

484
00:33:14,616 --> 00:33:18,211
Just for me

485
00:33:18,286 --> 00:33:22,017
I'm gonna take my time
and rock some rhyme

486
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,888
<i>Oh, it's gonna take
your breath away</i>

487
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,428
You'll be the front page
rage of the age

488
00:33:27,496 --> 00:33:31,956
Just wait and see

489
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:35,093
You're not just looking
at a fast-food king

490
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:38,571
Just another
well-known face

491
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,636
You're not looking
at the king of anything

492
00:33:44,713 --> 00:33:47,841
We're gonna shoot for the moon
We're gonna play high noon

493
00:33:47,916 --> 00:33:52,080
We're gonna take on
the entire human race

494
00:33:52,153 --> 00:33:55,850
<i>- You're not looking at a king
- No, no, no, no, no</i>

495
00:33:55,924 --> 00:33:59,052
- You're looking at an ace
- You're looking at an ace

496
00:33:59,127 --> 00:34:02,096
- You're looking at a goddamned ace
- You're looking at an ace

497
00:34:02,163 --> 00:34:05,496
- You're looking at an ace
- You're looking at an ace

498
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:10,061
You're looking
at an a-a-a-ace

499
00:34:10,138 --> 00:34:14,768
I just love home movies,
don't you?

500
00:34:14,843 --> 00:34:17,971
Time's tight, Janet.
Do it right, Janet.

501
00:34:19,581 --> 00:34:22,607
Until tomorrow night...

502
00:34:22,684 --> 00:34:24,777
Janet.

503
00:34:27,222 --> 00:34:32,285
Well, Farley Flavors
is fairly flattering.

504
00:34:34,896 --> 00:34:37,296
But I want to see Brad.

505
00:34:37,365 --> 00:34:40,334
The question is, Janet,
does Brad want to see you?

506
00:34:40,402 --> 00:34:44,736
- Quite frankly, he hates you.
- What do you mean?

507
00:34:44,806 --> 00:34:48,799
Brad is harboring deep feelings of hostility
towards you, Janet.

508
00:34:48,877 --> 00:34:51,675
- Towards me?
- It's classical.

509
00:34:51,746 --> 00:34:55,876
Almost a textbook case.

510
00:34:55,951 --> 00:34:58,681
Oh, no!

511
00:34:58,753 --> 00:35:01,085
That's an extremely
negative response.

512
00:35:01,156 --> 00:35:04,319
Yes, Janet. Leave
the crying to Brad.

513
00:35:04,392 --> 00:35:06,826
Is it because
I'm becoming too popular?

514
00:35:06,895 --> 00:35:11,798
On the contrary, Janet,
he wants to see your ratings soar.

515
00:35:11,866 --> 00:35:16,200
He needs a woman of
exceptional desirability.

516
00:35:16,271 --> 00:35:18,671
So, you see, Janet...

517
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:22,506
you can help us
to help him.

518
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,746
Maybe I can.

519
00:35:45,433 --> 00:35:48,561
<i>Stand by for Faith Factory rehearsal.</i>

520
00:35:48,637 --> 00:35:52,539
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.

521
00:35:52,607 --> 00:35:55,667
We'll probably be replaced by an hour
of fashion tips.

522
00:35:55,744 --> 00:35:59,271
- Now, Betty, don't overreact.
- Overreact?

523
00:35:59,347 --> 00:36:01,907
You're the one with
theories about conspirac-

524
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:06,249
- Oliver?
- Yes, Betty?

525
00:36:06,321 --> 00:36:10,781
Are you spoken for
this evening?

526
00:36:20,368 --> 00:36:23,098
<i>All right, you guys.</i>

527
00:36:23,171 --> 00:36:28,473
<i>An early start tomorrow forJanet's debut
on Good Morning Denton.</i>

528
00:36:28,543 --> 00:36:32,411
<i>By the time we unveil
Farley's Faith Factory show...</i>

529
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,314
we'll have all earned
our beauty sleep.

530
00:36:36,384 --> 00:36:41,253
<i>- Could I just peep in on Brad before I go home?
- Home?</i>

531
00:36:42,457 --> 00:36:45,119
Home.

532
00:36:45,193 --> 00:36:49,129
This is the nerve center
of operations, Janet.

533
00:36:49,197 --> 00:36:52,496
You must stay here tonight.
That way we can all be together...

534
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:57,266
when Mr. Sun paints us a new day
with his golden brush.

535
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:05,576
And you can "peep in"
on Brad in the morning.

536
00:37:05,647 --> 00:37:07,774
Morning?

537
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:10,010
Are all the beds
made up?

538
00:37:10,085 --> 00:37:12,315
Oh, yes! I've plumped up
all the pillows, changed-

539
00:37:12,387 --> 00:37:15,652
- Then lock up for the night.
- Okay!

540
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,278
<i>Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.</i>

541
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:44,341
It pays to know
your way around, Oliver.

542
00:37:44,419 --> 00:37:48,185
<i>I thought the Home of Happiness would
give your theory a new perspective.</i>

543
00:37:48,256 --> 00:37:50,952
A stately
pleasure home indeed.

544
00:37:51,025 --> 00:37:55,724
Oh, I adore
Coleridge Taylor.

545
00:37:55,797 --> 00:37:57,788
As a matter of fact-

546
00:38:03,004 --> 00:38:05,666
"It is an ancient Mariner...

547
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,903
"and he stoppeth
one of three.

548

"By thy long gray beard

549
00:38:13,882 --> 00:38:18,876
now wherefore
stop'st thou me?"

550
00:38:20,054 --> 00:38:22,147
Oh.

551
00:38:48,516 --> 00:38:51,280
I feel the heat
from your skin

552
00:38:51,352 --> 00:38:53,684
And the stubble
on your chin

553
00:38:53,755 --> 00:38:59,019
You're no good

554
00:38:59,093 --> 00:39:01,425
You've got dirt
on your hands

555
00:39:01,496 --> 00:39:03,896
And everybody
understands

556
00:39:03,965 --> 00:39:08,727
You're no good

557
00:39:08,803 --> 00:39:11,363
- Oh, what a joke
- What a joke

558
00:39:11,439 --> 00:39:13,907
You feel like choking

559
00:39:13,975 --> 00:39:16,466
- You play for broke
- You play for broke

560
00:39:16,544 --> 00:39:18,535
He leaves you smoking

561
00:39:18,613 --> 00:39:24,245
Oh, romance is not
a children's game

562
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:27,220
But you keep
going back

563
00:39:27,288 --> 00:39:31,452
It's driving you
insane

564
00:39:40,201 --> 00:39:45,161
Drift into
the treacle deep

565
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:49,472
Slip into its silent depths
Go to sleep

566
00:39:49,544 --> 00:39:54,379
With your everything
akimbo

567
00:39:54,449 --> 00:39:59,853
Float into
the sandman's limbo

It's been a great day
Thanks a heap

Now it's time

Are you decent, Janet?

587
00:42:08,483 --> 00:42:10,917
Hoopla, Bert!

588
00:42:10,985 --> 00:42:13,920
Nice to see you up and about.

Good morning.

592
00:42:58,566 --> 00:43:00,864
I wanna see Brad.

593
00:43:03,271 --> 00:43:06,502
Look at yourself.
You're beautiful.

594
00:43:06,574 --> 00:43:11,011
The most desirable creature
that ever walked.

595
00:43:12,914 --> 00:43:16,975
Oh, if only Brad could have found it within
himself to say those things to me.

596
00:43:17,051 --> 00:43:21,784
He will, but it's up to you
to reawaken his feelings.

597
00:43:21,856 --> 00:43:24,654
Farley's given you
that chance.

598
00:43:24,725 --> 00:43:27,091
<i>You can use

599

to knock Denton dead.

600
00:43:31,265 --> 00:43:33,426
Do you really think so?

601
00:43:33,501 --> 00:43:35,492
Everybody needs you.

602
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:42,503
- Hmm. But what'll I do? What'll I say?
- Hmm?

603
00:43:42,777 --> 00:43:44,802
- What'll I wear?
- Ah.

604
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:52,044
Ever since I was
a little boy

605
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,989
Dressing up has always been
my greatest joy

606
00:43:57,058 --> 00:43:59,856
But when it's time
to be discreet

607
00:43:59,927 --> 00:44:03,328
There's one thing
you just can't beat

608
00:44:03,397 --> 00:44:07,527
And that's a strapless
backless, classical little black dress

609
00:44:07,602 --> 00:44:10,696
Well, first you go
rip, rip, rip

610
00:44:10,771 --> 00:44:13,103
Then you go
snip, snip, snip

611
00:44:13,174 --> 00:44:15,540
Then you whip
in a zip, zip, zip

612
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:18,545
And split it up
to the hip, hip, hip

613
00:44:18,613 --> 00:44:21,810
And as you
strip, strip, strip

614
00:44:21,883 --> 00:44:24,875
You shiver and quiver

615
00:44:24,952 --> 00:44:27,011
For that soft caress

616
00:44:27,088 --> 00:44:31,616
- As you slip, slip, slip into that little black dress
- Hoopla!

00:55:12,728 --> 00:55:17,563
<i>Janet.! Janet.! We wantJanet.!</i>

771
00:55:17,633 --> 00:55:19,828
Oh, really?

772
00:55:19,902 --> 00:55:23,599
Macy, why don't you takeJanet
and help her freshen up before the rehearsal?

773
00:55:23,672 --> 00:55:26,607
Surely.

774
00:55:29,845 --> 00:55:33,042
Ralph. You promised
me an introduction.

775
00:55:33,115 --> 00:55:35,174
Later, Francine.

776
00:55:35,251 --> 00:55:37,549
<i>Frankie!</i>

777
00:55:38,587 --> 00:55:42,819
Bert, could you spare
a moment?

778
00:55:42,892 --> 00:55:45,793
<i>Of course.</i>

779
00:55:45,861 --> 00:55:48,421
Janet! Janet!
We wantJanet!

780
00:55:48,497 --> 00:55:52,126
- Janet! Janet! We wantJanet!
- Janet, a quick word.

781
00:55:52,201 --> 00:55:56,262
Could you tell our viewers what exactly you
will be representing tonight?

782
00:55:56,338 --> 00:55:59,307
- Sanity for today.
- Wow!

783
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:02,071
And that's the word
from Janet Majors...

784
00:56:02,144 --> 00:56:04,374
DTV's newest star.

785
00:56:04,446 --> 00:56:06,471
<i>Okay, guys, let's move on.</i>

786
00:56:06,549 --> 00:56:09,177
- How's Brad?
- He's a wreck.

787
00:56:09,251 --> 00:56:13,585
- Check. The quacks are willing tools?
- Ah, the quacks are fools.

788
00:56:13,656 --> 00:56:17,854
You know, I wouldn't mind doing Janet
one or two favors.

789
00:56:17,927 --> 00:56:20,760
It's time to check
with Flavors.

790
00:56:23,465 --> 00:56:27,162
<i>Shoot.</i>

791
00:56:33,309 --> 00:56:36,506
Is there anything else
you'd like, Janet?

792
00:56:36,579 --> 00:56:41,243
Yeah, a new carpet.
I hate the color. Don't you?

793
00:56:41,317 --> 00:56:44,809
<i>It's only one night, Janet.</i>

794
00:56:44,887 --> 00:56:48,050
- Don't forget who we're doing this for.
- Who?

795
00:56:48,123 --> 00:56:50,455
Brad.

796
00:56:50,526 --> 00:56:55,725
You know, I'm getting awfully sick of hearing
about that emotional cripple.

797
00:56:55,798 --> 00:57:00,701
I've got a lot going for me, you know.
I'm going places. I'm gonna be someone.

798
00:57:00,769 --> 00:57:03,670
I'm gonna win my way
into the lives and hearts of the people...

799
00:57:03,739 --> 00:57:07,402
even if I have
to kill to do it.

800
00:57:07,476 --> 00:57:10,968
I'll make the pathetic
little crumbs love me.

801
00:57:13,882 --> 00:57:16,783
I don't even know why
I'm wasting my time here with you.

802
00:57:16,852 --> 00:57:18,843
I should be with my people.

803
00:57:18,921 --> 00:57:22,152
<i>Janet.! Janet.! We wantJanet.!</i>

804
00:57:22,224 --> 00:57:24,158
<i>Janet.! Janet.!
We wantJanet.!</i>

805
00:57:24,226 --> 00:57:26,456
<i>Janet.! Janet.! We wantJanet.!</i>

806
00:57:26,528 --> 00:57:29,520
<i>Janet.! Janet.!
We wantJanet.!</i>

807
00:57:29,598 --> 00:57:31,691
Janet! Janet!
We wantJanet!

808
00:57:33,502 --> 00:57:35,527
<i>Hey, Janet.!</i>

809
00:57:35,604 --> 00:57:38,164
- Girl, you're great!
- Oh, thanks.

810
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,073
- Hi. My name's Frankie.
- Francine!

811
00:57:41,143 --> 00:57:43,873
<i>And I think you're beautiful.</i>

812
00:57:47,583 --> 00:57:52,077
Hi, I'm Brenda. This is my brother Oscar,
and this is our friend, Glish Davison.

813
00:57:52,154 --> 00:57:56,853
<i>Janet, we really enjoyed doing
the Breakfast Show with you.</i>

814
00:57:59,028 --> 00:58:03,192
This is Janet.
She's a phenomenon.

815
00:58:03,265 --> 00:58:06,325
So if you're looking for a standard
to which you can aspire

816
00:58:06,402 --> 00:58:08,734
<i>Then, baby</i>

817
00:58:08,804 --> 00:58:13,173
Look at me
Whoa-oh

818
00:58:14,777 --> 00:58:18,008
- Look at me
- All right!

819
00:58:22,651 --> 00:58:25,085
I think you need
a little rest.

820
00:58:25,154 --> 00:58:28,214
<i>You've got a big night
ahead of you.</i>

821
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:32,386
<i>Your clothes are real neat.</i>

822
00:58:32,461 --> 00:58:34,861
<i>Reminder. Wardrobe check-</i>

823
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:39,196
<i>We wantJanet.!
Janet.! Janet.! We wantJanet.!</i>

824
00:58:39,268 --> 00:58:41,998
Aren't they great?

825
00:58:42,071 --> 00:58:44,039
<i>But getting back
to Faith Factory...</i>

826
00:58:44,106 --> 00:58:47,098
all in all, it looks
like an exciting new series for us.

827
00:58:47,176 --> 00:58:49,974
Yes, and an attractive financial
prospect for Denton.

828
00:58:50,045 --> 00:58:54,072
- And fashion-wise?
- What did I tell you?

829
00:58:54,149 --> 00:58:58,142
<i>Well, I can just say that Faith Factory
will be introducing a new look...</i>

830
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:02,657
that will show off one or two old faces
in an exciting new light.

831
00:59:02,725 --> 00:59:06,422
<i>- Really? Sounds interesting.
- Did you hear that, Oliver?</i>

832
00:59:06,495 --> 00:59:10,829
Yes, Betty. But the false
promise of a new dawn...

833
00:59:10,899 --> 00:59:15,461
usually leads to
a most bloody sunset.

834
00:59:15,537 --> 00:59:19,803
No, I don't know whatJanet's next move
will be, but you can be sure of one thing.

835
00:59:19,875 --> 00:59:24,903
<i>- It all starts right here.
- Thank you.</i>

836
00:59:26,315 --> 00:59:28,579
And that's the word
from Ralph Hapschatt...

837
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:30,584
and Macy Struthers.

838
00:59:30,652 --> 00:59:32,916
<i>Janet.! Janet.! We wantJanet.!</i>

839
00:59:32,988 --> 00:59:35,616
<i>Janet.! Janet.!
We wantJanet.!</i>

840
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:37,625
- Oh, Oliver!
- Hmm?

841
00:59:37,693 --> 00:59:39,684
What are we going to do?

842
00:59:40,796 --> 00:59:42,855
Care to indulge?

843
00:59:42,931 --> 00:59:45,297
- Indulge?
- Mm-hmm.

844
00:59:45,367 --> 00:59:48,131
<i>- In a little, um, masquerade?
- Final reminder.</i>

845
00:59:48,203 --> 00:59:50,603
<i>- Oh.
- Wardrobe check for Faith Factory medical outfits.</i>

846
00:59:50,672 --> 00:59:53,539
<i>Wardrobe check for
Faith Factory medical outfits.</i>

847
00:59:53,609 --> 00:59:57,101
<i>Dentonvale.</i>

848
00:59:57,179 --> 00:59:59,340
<i>Parental predicament.</i>

849
00:59:59,415 --> 01:00:01,406
Oh, Harry,
what are we gonna do?

850
01:00:01,483 --> 01:00:04,316
I don't know, Emily.
I'm worried.

851
01:00:04,386 --> 01:00:08,584
Maybe I could wear
those black leather brogues.

852
01:00:08,657 --> 01:00:12,559
Too flashy.
They'll clash with the new outfits.

853
01:00:12,628 --> 01:00:17,531
It's all right, Brad, dear.

854
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:19,590
Have another sedative.

855
01:00:22,371 --> 01:00:24,737
We'll miss you
on the show tonight.

856
01:00:27,409 --> 01:00:30,810
<i>Don't worry, Brad.
I'll be back.</i>

857
01:00:32,347 --> 01:00:36,579
- What about those Italian loafers I bought in Hawaii?
- Mmm.

858
01:00:43,892 --> 01:00:48,056
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.

859
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:05,478
Face it, Janet.
Brad's an emotional cripple.

860
01:01:09,518 --> 01:01:12,954
- Quite frankly-
- He hates you.

861
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:19,919
<i>Time's tight, Janet.</i>

862
01:01:19,995 --> 01:01:22,759
<i>Do it right, Janet.</i>

863
01:01:22,831 --> 01:01:25,061
<i>Until tonight...</i>

864
01:01:26,134 --> 01:01:28,125
<i>Janet.</i>

865
01:01:32,074 --> 01:01:35,372
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.

866
01:01:35,407 --> 01:01:37,363
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.

867
01:01:42,412 --> 01:01:45,313
Out on a cul-de-sac

868
01:01:47,016 --> 01:01:49,951
And I gotta go back

869
01:01:51,755 --> 01:01:54,747
So come on, feet

870
01:01:55,859 --> 01:01:58,919
We gotta hit the street

871
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:05,058
We've got it made

872
01:02:05,135 --> 01:02:07,467
I'm looking for trade

873
01:02:09,506 --> 01:02:12,771
I'm lookin' for love

874
01:02:13,777 --> 01:02:16,109
I'm lookin' for trade

875
01:02:18,448 --> 01:02:22,748
I need some young blood
I need some young blood

876
01:02:22,819 --> 01:02:25,049
I need it now

877
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:31,620
I need some young blood
I need some young blood

878
01:02:31,694 --> 01:02:34,754
And we're gonna
get it somehow

879
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:39,033
I'm on a dead-end street

880
01:02:40,904 --> 01:02:43,464
I'm like a dog
in the heat

881
01:02:45,308 --> 01:02:49,267
I'm like a kid
with no toys

882
01:02:49,345 --> 01:02:53,611
I wanna get those boys

883
01:02:53,683 --> 01:02:58,484
Oh, I can't be delayed

884
01:02:58,555 --> 01:03:01,319
I'm looking for trade

885
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:07,159
I'm lookin' for love

886
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:09,790
I'm looking for trade

887
01:03:12,302 --> 01:03:16,932
Oh, we're all livin'
like there's no tomorrow

888
01:03:17,006 --> 01:03:20,908
And the way things are going
that's probably true

889
01:03:20,977 --> 01:03:24,743
But without you and me, Sis
the world would fall to pieces

890
01:03:24,814 --> 01:03:27,510
Vena cava
Who's the raver

891
01:03:27,584 --> 01:03:29,950
Our raving savior
that's you

892
01:03:32,155 --> 01:03:34,783
<i>I'm on the primrose path</i>

893
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:39,221
I'm looking for a laugh

894
01:03:40,997 --> 01:03:44,160
Remember, it's no fun

895
01:03:45,368 --> 01:03:48,303
To be the chosen one

896
01:03:49,706 --> 01:03:52,869
There are games
to be played

897
01:03:54,711 --> 01:03:57,111
Looking for trade

898
01:03:58,948 --> 01:04:02,543
I'm looking for love

899
01:04:02,619 --> 01:04:05,417
I'm looking for trade

900
01:04:07,891 --> 01:04:11,952
I need some young blood
I need some young blood

901
01:04:12,028 --> 01:04:14,155
And I need it now

902
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:16,221
Oh

903
01:04:16,299 --> 01:04:20,895
I need some young blood
I need some young blood

904
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:23,871
And I'm gonna
get it somehow

905
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:26,033
I'm looking for trade

906
01:04:26,109 --> 01:04:28,441
<i>Janet, Janet.! We wantJanet.!</i>

907
01:04:28,511 --> 01:04:33,107
<i>- Janet, Janet.! We wantJanet.!
- Janet? Janet?</i>

908
01:04:33,182 --> 01:04:35,810
<i>Wake up, Janet.</i>

909
01:04:35,885 --> 01:04:40,948
You've got guests.
You can come in now.

910
01:04:42,659 --> 01:04:45,389
- Hi, Janet.
- How are you feeling?

911
01:04:45,461 --> 01:04:47,588
Who are you?

912
01:04:47,664 --> 01:04:51,600
- The band.
- Do you have any friends?

913
01:04:51,668 --> 01:04:54,159
Sure.

914
01:04:54,237 --> 01:04:56,296
You won't have soon.

915
01:04:58,241 --> 01:05:01,005
What are you called,
your band?

916
01:05:01,077 --> 01:05:03,705
Oscar Drill
and the Bits.

917
01:05:18,461 --> 01:05:23,797
Betty, it's imperative we getJanet
out of Farley's fast fingers...

918
01:05:23,866 --> 01:05:28,803
and Brad out of that hellhole before
they both disappear forever.

919
01:05:28,871 --> 01:05:31,362
I don't mind
telling you, Oliver...

920
01:05:31,441 --> 01:05:34,103
I'm not looking
forward to this.

921
01:05:34,177 --> 01:05:36,407
If only I could
place that name.

922
01:05:36,479 --> 01:05:40,245
- McKinley.
- There was a president.

923
01:05:40,316 --> 01:05:42,546
President?

924
01:05:42,619 --> 01:05:45,554
Past presidents.

925
01:05:45,622 --> 01:05:48,750
Betty, this is
beginning to add up.

926
01:05:48,825 --> 01:05:51,453
Really?

927
01:05:51,527 --> 01:05:53,586
What'll I pin this on?

928
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:55,654
Faith, Betty.

929
01:05:57,467 --> 01:06:00,800
But make sure it's your own.

930
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,531
In a hurry, Mr. Flavors?

931
01:06:06,609 --> 01:06:09,601
There's a little lady
he doesn't wanna keep waiting.

932
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:13,171
- And a date.
- Who with, Mr. Flavors?

933
01:06:15,685 --> 01:06:17,676
The past.

934
01:06:24,794 --> 01:06:27,991
Like a virgin with an urgin'
in a surgery

935
01:06:28,064 --> 01:06:31,397
I'll be swingin'
I'll be bringing out the nurse in me

936
01:06:31,467 --> 01:06:34,527
The art will start
when I play my part

937
01:06:34,604 --> 01:06:37,732
As a healer who will
steal your heart

938
01:06:37,807 --> 01:06:41,971
Oh, look what I did
to my id

939
01:06:44,213 --> 01:06:48,343
Oh, look what I did
to my id

940
01:06:50,486 --> 01:06:53,614
With neurosis in profusion

941
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:57,148
And psychosis in your soul

942
01:06:57,226 --> 01:07:00,320
Eliminate confusion

943
01:07:00,396 --> 01:07:06,301
And hide inside
a brand-new role

944
01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:10,396
Like a good-time girl
I'm gonna try some new tricks

945
01:07:10,473 --> 01:07:13,271
This could be the start
of a whole new career

946
01:07:13,342 --> 01:07:16,539
Got a deep plum lipstick
and some therapeutics

947
01:07:16,612 --> 01:07:19,376
This could take us to a town
that's nowhere near here

948
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:23,249
Got the hot flush symptoms
and I'm feelin' sneaky

949
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:25,879
Young male intern
tall and handsome

950
01:07:25,955 --> 01:07:29,391
Got my hem so high
they'll say I'm being cheeky

951
01:07:29,459 --> 01:07:32,895
With legs like mine
I'm really made for dancin'

952
01:07:35,064 --> 01:07:37,259
Whoa-oh-oh

953
01:07:38,434 --> 01:07:40,425
Hey, hey, hey

954
01:07:45,308 --> 01:07:48,709
When heaven's
in the music

955
01:07:48,778 --> 01:07:51,906
Hell is in control

956
01:07:51,981 --> 01:07:54,506
The angels got the voices

957
01:07:54,584 --> 01:08:00,045
But the devil's got
the rock and roll

958
01:08:01,724 --> 01:08:04,557
We may look like
we're phony medics

959
01:08:04,627 --> 01:08:07,619
But we took our look
from a book by Fredericks

960
01:08:07,697 --> 01:08:12,999
Oh, look what I did
to my id, kid

961
01:08:14,237 --> 01:08:18,230
Look what I did
to my id

962
01:08:18,307 --> 01:08:19,408
<i>- Oh, Brad.
- He's an emotional cripple, remember?</i>

963
01:08:19,443 --> 01:08:22,536
<i>- Oh, Brad.
- He's an emotional cripple, remember?</i>

964
01:08:22,612 --> 01:08:24,944
Even he wouldn't like
to see you like this.

965
01:08:25,014 --> 01:08:28,711
<i>Ralph, I need a final statement from her,
and if I don't get it, there's gonna be trouble.</i>

966
01:08:28,785 --> 01:08:31,549
- Later, Neely, okay?
- Ralph!

967
01:08:31,621 --> 01:08:34,351
How is she?

968
01:08:34,423 --> 01:08:36,857
Well, come on.
Farley's expecting her any minute.

969
01:08:36,926 --> 01:08:39,417
You guys get your asses
in front of those cameras...

970
01:08:39,495 --> 01:08:42,225
and try and earn yourselves
a reputation, okay?

971
01:08:42,298 --> 01:08:44,232
Well, move!

972
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,632
We just wanna ask
a few questions.

973
01:08:48,771 --> 01:08:51,604
These are for you, Janet.

974
01:08:51,674 --> 01:08:53,699
They'll make you feel
a whole lot better.

975
01:08:53,776 --> 01:08:55,710
Yeah.

976
01:08:59,715 --> 01:09:01,706
Amateurs.

977
01:09:06,422 --> 01:09:09,289
<i>- Give us a "J".!

01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:27,435
you'll find plenty to keep
you going here tonight.

991
01:10:27,503 --> 01:10:29,562
And, naturally,
feeling the excitement...

992
01:10:29,639 --> 01:10:32,164
and not wishing to stick out
like a sore thumb...

993
01:10:32,241 --> 01:10:35,267
I had to get a little outfit
of my own together.

994
01:10:35,344 --> 01:10:38,177
And this...

995
01:10:38,247 --> 01:10:40,238
is it.

996
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,291

DTV proudly presents
Denton's own...

999
01:11:07,109 --> 01:11:10,943
with a suburban
garage sound.

1000
01:11:11,013 --> 01:11:15,109
Let's hear it for
Oscar Drill and the Bits!

1001
01:11:15,184 --> 01:11:16,947
Oh, Oliver.

1002
01:11:17,019 --> 01:11:19,920
<i>This is one time charity

<i>One, two, three, four.!</i>

1004
01:11:28,264 --> 01:11:33,600
I know how it feels
to be coolin' my heels

1005
01:11:33,669 --> 01:11:36,900
I've been down on them
long enough

1006
01:11:37,974 --> 01:11:41,637
<i>But if I take
to them now</i>

1007
01:11:41,711 --> 01:11:44,703
Then maybe somehow

1008
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:46,839
You'll see
through the bluff

1009
01:11:46,916 --> 01:11:49,009
Of my playin' it tough

1010
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:53,654
I've been a lifetime on deposit

1011
01:11:53,723 --> 01:11:56,556
And that's a long time
in the closet

1012
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:59,287
- And if you say to me
- How was it

1013
01:11:59,362 --> 01:12:02,593
It was hard takin'
that heartbreakin'

1014

<i>Buh-buh-buh-buh, buh-duh

Whoo!

1017
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:15,404
<i>You may say

<i>To be in my shoes</i>

1019
01:12:18,514 --> 01:12:22,075
But look what it
did for me

1020
01:12:23,886 --> 01:12:27,014
<i>I got buried alive</i>

1021
01:12:27,089 --> 01:12:30,058
<i>I don't thrive

1022
01:12:30,126 --> 01:12:32,094
Look and you'll see

1023
01:12:32,161 --> 01:12:34,425
That my spikes
don't fit me

1024
01:12:35,931 --> 01:12:38,900
I've been a lifetime
on deposit

1025

And that's a long time

<i>- Breakin'out

1031
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:57,818
To a family reunion.

1032
01:12:57,887 --> 01:12:59,616
Breakin' out

Breakin' out

1035

And she represents everything
our customers want-

1036
01:13:23,045 --> 01:13:25,036
innocence...

1037
01:13:25,114 --> 01:13:27,139
decency...

1038
01:13:27,216 --> 01:13:29,184
and the illusion
of a happy ending.

1039
01:13:29,251 --> 01:13:32,220
Oh, jolly good, Mr. Flavors.

1040
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:38,627
And behind her image,
take-away therapy will thrive...

1041
01:13:38,694 --> 01:13:43,825
under the capable hands
of two great ethical intellects...

1042
01:13:43,899 --> 01:13:46,231
operating on the frontiers
of medical science.

1043

- Huh? Huh?
- Mac and Nation.

1044
01:13:48,304 --> 01:13:50,238
Mac and Nation.
Yes. Great work.

1045
01:13:50,306 --> 01:13:53,503
And under
the firm guidance...

1046
01:13:53,576 --> 01:13:56,841
of a great survivor...

1047
01:13:56,912 --> 01:13:59,813

sea of diplomacy...

1048

1049
01:14:01,951 --> 01:14:04,511
Huh?

1050
01:14:04,587 --> 01:14:07,317
- Now let's get this show on the road!
- Hey!

1051
01:14:10,893 --> 01:14:14,727
Mr. Flavors, may I have a moment
of your time?

1052
01:14:15,831 --> 01:14:17,765
Sure thing.

1053
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:22,998
We've heard rumors that you're going to
unveil more than just a new series tonight.

1054
01:14:23,072 --> 01:14:25,540
- Is this true?
- Absolutely correct.

1055
01:14:25,608 --> 01:14:28,941
Could you tell us
a little more about it?

1056
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:31,172
Well, let just say...

1057
01:14:31,247 --> 01:14:35,911
we're planning on putting sanity
back on the national menu.

1058
01:14:35,985 --> 01:14:39,477
And how does local girl

1059

<i>fit into the scheme of things?</i>

01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:50,398
nicely.

1062
01:14:55,738 --> 01:14:57,729
Brad?

1063
01:14:59,575 --> 01:15:01,668
And he's resented you
all these years.

1064
01:15:01,744 --> 01:15:04,611
- And Janet?
- She represents everything he was denied.

1065
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,614
Oh.

01:16:12,381 --> 01:16:16,283
<i>The dress Janet's wearing has been given by
Crme de la Crme Modes of downtown Denton...</i>

1081
01:16:16,352 --> 01:16:20,652
and we've been asked that you take note of
the individual styling and exquisite tailoring.

1082
01:16:20,723 --> 01:16:24,489
This is just one of the many
gifts so freely and generously given toJanet.

1083
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:29,088
<i>The first of, we hope, many.
Miss Mental Health.</i>

1084
01:16:36,372 --> 01:16:39,603
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president.

1085
01:16:39,675 --> 01:16:41,870
<i>The president's here!</i>

1086
01:16:41,944 --> 01:16:43,935
Zoom in there.

1087
01:16:54,857 --> 01:17:00,420
Hi, I'm Irwin Lapsey,
president of Lapsey Autos.

1088
01:17:01,892 --> 01:17:05,350
And I'm holding
in my hand here some keys.

1089
01:17:05,429 --> 01:17:10,025
Keys which I would like to give to the little lady
who's being so honored here tonight.

1090
01:17:11,268 --> 01:17:13,964
And I want to tell you.
If she takes these keys...

1091
01:17:14,037 --> 01:17:16,369
she will find that
they fit something.

1092
01:17:19,309 --> 01:17:23,473
And what that something is,
is an almost brand-new...

1093
01:17:23,547 --> 01:17:27,881
<i>ultra-deluxe,
eight-cylinder convertible...</i>

1094
01:17:27,951 --> 01:17:32,354
<i>complete with radio, tape deck,
washable seat covers and many, many extras.</i>

1095
01:17:32,422 --> 01:17:35,823
And it's all hers
for absolutely free.

1096
01:17:49,706 --> 01:17:51,765
<i>Well, Janet's-</i>

1097
01:17:51,842 --> 01:17:55,334
Janet's absolutely speechless,
ladies and gentlemen.

1098
01:17:57,481 --> 01:17:59,711
But here's someone
we do want to hear from.

1099
01:17:59,783 --> 01:18:02,843
<i>A firm favorite
of yours and mine.</i>

1100
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,184
<i>You've revelled in his recipes.</i>

1101
01:18:05,255 --> 01:18:07,519
<i>You've marvelled at
his marriage guidance.</i>

1102
01:18:07,591 --> 01:18:11,960
The all-knowing,
and now, all-seeing-

1103
01:18:12,029 --> 01:18:14,520
<i>That's right.!</i>

1104
01:18:14,598 --> 01:18:18,694
<i>Bert Schnick!</i>

1105
01:18:27,978 --> 01:18:32,142
There. Down there. Come on, Betty.

1106
01:18:35,352 --> 01:18:37,786
Bert, you're beautiful!

1107
01:18:39,022 --> 01:18:41,616
- Hoopla, Denton!
- Hoopla, Bert!

1108
01:18:41,692 --> 01:18:45,594
- Thank you. Welcome.
- What's cooking, Bert?

1109
01:18:45,662 --> 01:18:49,894
I'll tell you what's cooking,
buddy, and I'll tell you too, you guys.

1110
01:18:49,967 --> 01:18:54,233
She made the blind see,
and it was a gift.

1111
01:18:54,304 --> 01:18:57,467
Who was the gift from?

1112
01:18:57,541 --> 01:19:01,170
- Let's hear an "F" for-
- Farley!

1113
01:19:01,245 --> 01:19:05,341
- And another "F" for-
- Flavors!

1114
01:19:29,273 --> 01:19:31,264
My friends!

1115
01:19:32,609 --> 01:19:36,568
And you are all my friends.

1116
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:42,483
My friends, tonight we are taking
the first step of defiance...

1117
01:19:42,552 --> 01:19:47,285
and starting something
that will grow so big...

1118
01:19:47,357 --> 01:19:50,793
that the whole world will
reverberate with its sound.

1119
01:19:50,861 --> 01:19:54,888
<i>And wherever our slogan...</i>

1120
01:19:54,965 --> 01:19:58,560
"sanity and vanity"...

1121
01:19:58,635 --> 01:20:00,967
is uttered...

1122
01:20:01,038 --> 01:20:05,270
it will be linked
incontrovertibly with this night...

1123
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:08,140
this station...

1124
01:20:08,211 --> 01:20:13,808
and this...
beautiful face.

1125
01:20:17,955 --> 01:20:20,253
Huh? Come on!
This way!

1126
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,527
<i>It's a crazy man.!</i>

1127
01:20:35,405 --> 01:20:38,704
- Seducer!
- And who are you, sir?

1128
01:20:38,775 --> 01:20:42,677
- Your twin brother and your accuser!
- Brad.

1129
01:20:42,746 --> 01:20:45,772
<i>Arrest that man.!
He's committed to our care.</i>

1130
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:49,282
I never signed your contract.

1131
01:20:49,353 --> 01:20:52,447
He's not going anywhere.

1132
01:20:52,522 --> 01:20:55,423
To revenge your twin,
you tried to abuse her.

1133
01:20:55,492 --> 01:20:57,619
A ridiculous accusation!

1134
01:20:57,694 --> 01:21:00,094
You force me to refuse her.

1135
01:21:02,599 --> 01:21:07,901
- Then why did you choose her?
- Because of you, sir.

1136
01:21:07,971 --> 01:21:10,940
<i>You're a loser</i>

1137
01:21:11,008 --> 01:21:16,605
<i>An abomination in the eyes
of any sensitive man</i>

1138
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:20,411
And you're
a blind-alley cruiser

1139
01:21:20,484 --> 01:21:23,612
Always headin'
down a losin' straight

1140
01:21:23,687 --> 01:21:26,281
Dreamin' that you're
screamin' at fate

1141
01:21:26,356 --> 01:21:29,519
You're a dead-end deadbeat
nowhere mister

1142
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:32,562
With a kisser like
a Mississippi alligator sister

1143
01:21:32,629 --> 01:21:37,396
<i>I've took as much of you
as any man can</i>

1144
01:21:37,467 --> 01:21:40,630
- You've lost your heart
- You've lost your cause

1145
01:21:40,704 --> 01:21:43,502
You lost your baby
when you lost your balls

1146
01:21:43,573 --> 01:21:46,167
You've lost your mind
You've lost your grip

1147
01:21:46,243 --> 01:21:49,406
So say bye-bye

1148
01:21:49,479 --> 01:21:52,505
We lost our mom
We lost our dad

1149
01:21:52,582 --> 01:21:56,245
And if I'm losin' you
Well, that's too bad

1150
01:21:56,319 --> 01:21:59,311
<i>Well, the best thing you
could ever do</i>

1151
01:21:59,389 --> 01:22:01,414
Is die

1152
01:22:01,491 --> 01:22:04,289
You're a failure

1153
01:22:04,361 --> 01:22:07,524
A malformation
in the guise of many

1154
01:22:07,597 --> 01:22:10,088
<i>An also-ran</i>

1155
01:22:10,167 --> 01:22:13,762
And you're a weeper
and a wailer

1156
01:22:13,837 --> 01:22:16,101
Always treadin'
on the toes of the great

1157
01:22:17,407 --> 01:22:19,967
Generally spreading
your weight

1158
01:22:20,043 --> 01:22:22,978
You're a spiteful, hateful
asinine creature

1159
01:22:23,046 --> 01:22:25,879
<i>Apupil with no scruples who
knew better than the teacher</i>

1160
01:22:25,949 --> 01:22:31,114
I've took as much of you
as any man can

1161
01:22:31,188 --> 01:22:34,351
- You've lost your heart
- You've lost your cause

1162
01:22:34,424 --> 01:22:37,518
You lost your baby
when you lost your balls

1163
01:22:37,594 --> 01:22:40,620
You lost your mind
when you lost your grip

1164
01:22:40,697 --> 01:22:42,858
So say bye-bye

1165
01:22:42,933 --> 01:22:46,164
<i>We lost our home
Our family</i>

1166
01:22:46,236 --> 01:22:49,797
<i>You've lost compassion
Now you're losin'me</i>

1167
01:22:49,873 --> 01:22:53,001
Well, the best thing
you could ever do

1168
01:22:53,076 --> 01:22:55,704
Is die

1169
01:22:55,779 --> 01:23:01,308
Well, the best thing
you could ever do is die

1170
01:23:01,384 --> 01:23:06,219
<i>Well, the best thing you
could ever do is die</i>

1171
01:23:06,289 --> 01:23:09,156
Take no notice of him.
He's mad.

1172
01:23:11,495 --> 01:23:14,362
I'm as sane as you are.

1173
01:23:14,431 --> 01:23:17,594
- Saner!
- And he was only with us for one day.

1174
01:23:21,638 --> 01:23:25,096
They should be sent
to the Danube at dawn.

1175
01:23:25,175 --> 01:23:27,109
What?

1176
01:23:27,177 --> 01:23:29,168
Just memories.

1177
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:37,010
We'll edit the tapes.
It'll never see airplay.

1178
01:23:37,087 --> 01:23:39,078
Um, I hope Mr. Flavors
will accept apologies...

1179
01:23:39,156 --> 01:23:42,057
on behalf of all of Denton
for this unfortunate incident.

1180
01:23:42,125 --> 01:23:44,389
It seems everyone wants
to be related to the great.

1181
01:23:44,461 --> 01:23:47,521
<i>Damn right.!</i>

1182
01:23:47,597 --> 01:23:49,588
No offense. No offense.

1183
01:23:49,666 --> 01:23:53,363
On the contrary, this is a perfect example
of what we're here to combat.

1184
01:24:07,884 --> 01:24:12,378
Out! Out!
Out! Out!

1185
01:24:12,455 --> 01:24:15,447
Out! Out! Out!

1186
01:24:15,525 --> 01:24:18,050
Out! Out! Out!

1187
01:24:18,128 --> 01:24:24,831
<i>Out.! Out.! Out.!</i>

1188
01:24:24,901 --> 01:24:28,166
Out! Out! Out!

1189
01:24:28,238 --> 01:24:33,301
Out! Out! Out!
Out! Out! Out!

1190
01:24:33,376 --> 01:24:35,936
Out! Out! Out!

1191
01:24:36,012 --> 01:24:40,005
Do you see? You see, the way we got rid
of that dirty little dish...

1192
01:24:40,083 --> 01:24:43,575
is the way we're going to put
the rest of our house in order...

1193
01:24:43,653 --> 01:24:45,814
including the upstairs!

1194
01:24:51,228 --> 01:24:53,696
Ah, yes, yes.
Miss. You, yes.

1195
01:24:53,763 --> 01:24:55,788
<i>Would you come up
and help us to inaugurate...</i>

1196
01:24:55,865 --> 01:25:00,029
<i>Farley Flavors' Faith Factory, transmitting
from coast to coast and continent to continent?</i>

1197
01:25:00,103 --> 01:25:03,197
- You are Miss- Miss-
- Macy. Macy Struthers.

1198
01:25:03,273 --> 01:25:06,834
Macy Struthers!

1199
01:25:10,947 --> 01:25:13,040
Who loves you, baby?

1200
01:25:16,286 --> 01:25:18,880
She let me down.

1201
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:24,389
She let us all down!

1202
01:25:24,461 --> 01:25:28,022
Shut up, Emily,
and listen to a success story.

1203
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:36,395
This could be worse
than the old series.

1204
01:25:36,473 --> 01:25:39,237
In the old series,
we never had a convertible.

1205
01:25:42,412 --> 01:25:45,176
<i>And remember,
sanity today...</i>

1206
01:25:46,583 --> 01:25:50,679
is a springboard to
the hygienic tomorrow.

1207
01:26:01,064 --> 01:26:04,659
Now will you follow me...

1208
01:26:04,734 --> 01:26:08,192
<i>down the DTV trail
to Dentonvale?</i>

1209
01:26:13,109 --> 01:26:16,601
Thanks, honey. They bought it.
Now out of the way. That's right!

1210
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:18,614
I can't stand it.

1211
01:26:18,682 --> 01:26:21,276
Everything good always
happens to other people.

1212
01:26:39,135 --> 01:26:44,004
<i>And fast-food giant, Farley Flavors
has just given Miss Mental Health...</i>

1213
01:26:44,074 --> 01:26:48,033
what can only be described as
an official kiss of approval.

1214
01:26:48,111 --> 01:26:50,102
And the crowd
are loving it...

1215
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:53,206
<i>as they follow her down
the Dentonvale trail.</i>

1216
01:26:53,283 --> 01:26:55,274
Hey, look!
They're havin' a party.

1217
01:27:02,792 --> 01:27:05,761
Come on, you guys.
We're gonna miss out on the action.

1218
01:27:05,829 --> 01:27:08,525
<i>Hurry.! Get in there.!</i>

1219
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:19,736
Some people do it
for compassion

1220
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:25,241
Some people do it
for the fashion

1221
01:27:25,315 --> 01:27:29,342
Some people
do it to be funny

1222
01:27:29,419 --> 01:27:33,321
Some people
do it for the money

1223
01:27:33,390 --> 01:27:37,190
Some people do it
for enslavement

1224
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:41,663
- Some people do it on the pavement
- But

1225
01:27:41,731 --> 01:27:47,694
We're gonna do it anyhow
anyhow

1226
01:27:47,771 --> 01:27:52,970
We're gonna do it
no matter how the wind is blowing

1227
01:27:53,042 --> 01:27:58,678
We're gonna do it anyhow
anyhow

1228
01:27:58,748 --> 01:28:02,912
We're gonna do it
We just gotta keep going

1229
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:05,716
Some people do it
for each other

1230

Some people do it
for employment

1235
01:28:19,202 --> 01:28:21,136
But

We're gonna do it anyhow

We're gonna do it
no matter how the wind is blowing

You're the acceptable face

1246
01:29:04,647 --> 01:29:06,808
Of the human race

to a smooth operator</i>

1261
01:31:08,204 --> 01:31:10,968
<i>He'll take you
for all that you've got</i>
