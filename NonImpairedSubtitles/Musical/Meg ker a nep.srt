1
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:28,433
- Tell them
- With your orders

2
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:36,118
Yes... the bailiff wants to speak to you.

3
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:44,478
Only together.

4
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:52,833
- Together.
- Together.

5
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:11,554
Friends, sing together

6
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:15,516
The sad song and crowned work

7
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:18,991
Only the rich peolple have a fatherland

8
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:25,399
The Valley and the field, belong to them

9
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:02,557
Right to the people!

10
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,960
Right to the people!

11
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:38,115
I had to talk to you

12
00:03:44,361 --> 00:03:45,800
Camarades!

13
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:50,238
I followed of near the mouvments which had
Agitated Hungary

14
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:55,117
Here like everywhere, the capital
Monopolize all the national production

15
00:03:55,281 --> 00:03:59,433
It creates new industries
But it asservire agriculture

16
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:03,437
And ruined the traditional
independant exploitation

17
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:06,155
Would you allow me to go nearer to you?

18
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:09,996
I want to hear what you are reading.
The agricultural population is divided

19
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:12,220
Into the group of large landowners,
capitalist underfarmers

20
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:14,160
and the masses of landless proletarians.

21
00:04:14,361 --> 00:04:17,159
We have to go through this
capitalistic revolutiononce.

22
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:20,160
It means indescribable suffering
for the majority of the people,

23
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:23,160
But it alone creates

24
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:26,911
The conditions which ensure
a new social system

25
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,157
It creates men and women

26
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:32,160
Who will have the strength
and wish

27
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:35,160
For the materialization of a new,
better social order.

28
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:39,354
Sincerely yours: Friedrich Engels.

29
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:41,439
Did you understand anything from this?

30
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:43,154
I did.

31
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:46,154
I understand, but did you
understand anything?

32
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:48,391
Let me see!

33
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:50,836
I want to dispute it with you.

34
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:55,080
We are workers, We have no freedom

35
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:59,149
Because instead of luck
we were hit by misfortune

36
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:01,756
Never mind! Never mind!

37
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:05,357
Long live the worker
Long live the rights

38
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:09,151
Long live the workers' society

39
00:05:09,441 --> 00:05:13,275
We shall break the horn
Of that great lord

40
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:17,554
He shall not give orders
For the poor workers

41
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:20,396
Never mind!

42
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:24,315
Long live the worker
Long live the rights

43
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:27,473
Long live the workers' society

44
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:31,960
If we cannot live happily

45
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:36,151
We shall have to wander away

46
00:05:36,441 --> 00:05:38,796
Never mind!

47
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:42,517
Long live the worker
Long live the rights

48
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:46,156
Long live the workers' society

49
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:57,079
You know better than me,
that one does not only live on prayers

50
00:05:57,841 --> 00:05:59,718
Here is the food, we can agree

51
00:05:59,801 --> 00:06:03,271
Our patience is running out we consider
your movement as a crime against the nation

52
00:06:03,721 --> 00:06:06,235
Against the bread

53
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:11,189
Still, authorized by the Underfarmers' Society,
I repeat my offer

54
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:13,836
We pay what was always
customary in our country

55
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:17,040
Which you know better than me

56
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,480
Thirty-two bushels of wheat

57
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:21,517
Thirty-two florins of cash

58
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:24,232
Thirty-two livres of salts

59
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:25,874
Permission to keep one cow

60
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:28,199
One acre of corn field

61
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:31,634
Hemp field

62
00:06:31,921 --> 00:06:35,118
Two pigs with their yearly
offsprings.

63
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:37,357
If not, not!

64
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:42,070
You cannot blame me for not
trying to help you

65
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:46,072
For not trying to speak to
you.

66
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:47,960
Leave us, we are sworn men

67
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,590
Drop the guns!

68
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:53,313
Cowards, dogs, brigands! Gendarmes!

69
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:57,718
We gave you bread!

70
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:01,355
- Go away!
- I told you, drop it!

71
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:22,240
Come here, mister bailiff!

72
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:28,432
Hey, hey, men!

73
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:32,510
Stop!

74
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:35,277
Help!

75
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,111
Shout/

76
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:53,752
Load! Fire!

77
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:58,040
Is there an independent man
among you?

78
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,236
Is there one who does not
serve someone else?

79
00:10:00,521 --> 00:10:03,240
- Who is a master of his own destiny?
- There is none.

80
00:10:05,921 --> 00:10:06,990
Fire! Fire! Fire!

81
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:11,389
Most of men are not independant.

82
00:10:11,681 --> 00:10:13,399
The masses are born in misery and
oppression and die in the same privation.

83
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:15,751
We are ignorants as our parents were

84
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,874
They do not die from their own,
but from someone else's illness.

85
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,755
For we inherited our parents'
ignorance, and hand it over to our children.

86
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:25,271
For we are wearing the yoke of the few!

87
00:10:25,561 --> 00:10:27,631
For we endure the oppression!

88
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,639
We, socialists swear to God

89
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:51,397
That we shall serve faithfully
all our life

90
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:59,033
We shall not want even the
slightest penny of our comrades

91
00:11:02,841 --> 00:11:05,339
That we shall respect our comrades
as our brothers and if necessary,

92
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,039
shall die for them!

93
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:13,632
So help me God!

94
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:18,157
This is the plan of the brigand

95
00:11:18,441 --> 00:11:20,796
This is the plan of the brigand

96
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:25,153
To strangle us and ruin

97
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:29,440
Cannon answered, boom-boom,
cannons said Come here, come here,

98
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:33,514
Cannon answered, boom-boom,
cannons said Come here, come here,

99
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:37,594
Let's dance and celebrate the
cannon of the liberator.

100
00:11:37,841 --> 00:11:40,355
The cock of my godmother

101
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:43,911
Flew onto the fence, the fence

102
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:47,154
It crows, it crows

103
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:50,478
My godmother is a whore, is a whore

104
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:53,519
Godmother do as you like, as you like

105
00:11:53,601 --> 00:11:57,594
I am the cock, you the hen, you the hen

106
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:35,874
Cadet!

107
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:39,800
Cadet! Your revolver!

108
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:44,153
The cat has four legs,

109
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:46,875
The fifth is its tail,

110
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:55,312
Off we go to Moldavia,
In the land of Moldavia,

111
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:05,354
The cat has four legs,
The fifth is its tail,

112
00:13:13,081 --> 00:13:16,676
Friends, sing together.

113
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:19,878
The sad song and crowned work

114
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:24,276
Only the rich peolple have a fatherland

115
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:28,200
The Valley and the field, belong to them

116
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:31,511
We built their palate

117
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:35,278
Who dominate us so proudly

118
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:39,038
Who dominate us so proudly?

119
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:43,513
But, what are there for us
In theses campaigns?

120
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:46,754
Nothing is with us,
Not a piece

121
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:50,671
Only our tomb
All at the end,

122
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:54,351
When we leave this bagne

123
00:13:54,841 --> 00:13:58,038
Take care with the hungry people!

124
00:13:58,721 --> 00:14:01,918
All will become insurrectionnists!

125
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:05,632
They will rise!

126
00:14:06,081 --> 00:14:09,153
They will kill!

127
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:13,997
Tomorrow, we will bu free!

128
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:22,359
The wild anger of the tempest struck us

129
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:26,551
Every damnation of vicious hell upon us

130
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:30,600
The day for our final attack is nearing

131
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:34,239
Who knows what the future brings

132
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:37,360
We look forward with proud hearts,

133
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:42,996
We carry the red flag of the workers,

134
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:49,311
With too many lords, there's no freedom

135
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:52,879
With too many rich, there's even more poor,

136
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:56,558
With too many pomp, men don't work,

137
00:14:56,961 --> 00:15:00,476
With too much past, the present is poor,

138
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:04,800
With so much ignorance, there are many tyrants.

139
00:15:05,441 --> 00:15:10,640
Where there are many pharisees,
their humanism is rare

140
00:16:58,681 --> 00:17:02,799
We look forward, with proud hearts,

141
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:07,678
We carry the red flag of the workers,

142
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:12,799
With us the suffering slaves of the earth,

143
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:16,836
Will gain a freer and better homeland!

144
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:22,156
We look forward, with proud hearts,

145
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:26,673
We carry the red flag of the workers,

146
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:31,472
With us the suffering slaves of the earth,

147
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:35,754
Will gain a freer and better homeland!

148
00:18:28,601 --> 00:18:31,798
I was sent to kill you.

149
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:41,714
The bride is a pretty flower,
Her garland is of bluebells,

150
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:45,630
He is the happy bridegroom,
Who can say, she is mine.

151
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:49,630
The bride is a garland of pearls,
Only my heart is sad,

152
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:53,278
The heart of the bride, and
All her heart beats are mine.

153
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:57,110
The top of the tree is in bloom,
Garland is on the head of the girl,

154
00:23:57,281 --> 00:24:00,990
The flowers have to fall,
The girl has to marry,

155
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:04,876
Come my honey, come,
For my heart awaits you,

156
00:24:05,161 --> 00:24:08,631
Longing for you, longing for you.
If you kiss me I'll be happy,

157
00:24:08,921 --> 00:24:12,152
Pretty girl is you see,
The wind plays with her nice hair,

158
00:24:12,441 --> 00:24:16,195
Still until the following day
It's unaware off all the chagrin

159
00:24:16,481 --> 00:24:19,234
But the flower will fade
The girl must mary

160
00:24:19,561 --> 00:24:23,600
She will know sorrow
Its happiness will end

161
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:27,157
The charrette arrived
And soon will teke it along

162
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:31,116
But says the engaged girl
I will never marry.

163
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:42,310
A beautiful flower is married
Its crown is of lily of the valley

164
00:24:42,641 --> 00:24:45,997
Happy is his engaged
For which it is intended

165
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:49,239
The girl is a pearl
My heart is heavy because i love him

166
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:53,680
The heart of the pretty engaged
Is mine, entire

167
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:10,678
Good morning, Adam Balog

168
00:25:11,401 --> 00:25:15,314
In a velvet cap

169
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:19,278
Good morning, pretty Barbara

170
00:25:19,841 --> 00:25:23,356
Skilled in dancing

171
00:25:27,721 --> 00:25:31,430
- Do you recognize me, men?
- Yes, my lord

172
00:26:11,081 --> 00:26:13,197
I want to talk to you, men

173
00:26:14,761 --> 00:26:16,911
Will you listen to me? Men!

174
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:19,591
You know me very well

175
00:26:19,881 --> 00:26:23,157
You know i didn't come to open up the wounds,
but to heal them

176
00:26:23,521 --> 00:26:25,751
You are clever men, workers from the Plain.

177
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:28,794
You know the situation better here than i do

178
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:31,192
But in many respects you don't know

179
00:26:31,481 --> 00:26:33,870
You have probably heard the word economy.

180
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:36,999
But, do you no the most important
basic principales

181
00:26:37,281 --> 00:26:39,795
Of economic is that the relationship
between offer and demand

182
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:44,553
Who determines the value of not only the goods
but also of human labour,

183
00:26:44,961 --> 00:26:47,191
But you repute this

184
00:26:47,841 --> 00:26:50,833
However, if the price of wheat increases,
we need some workers

185
00:26:50,921 --> 00:26:52,877
If the price decrease
field workers are in unemployment

186
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:55,994
You can't solve this even if you
own the land

187
00:26:56,321 --> 00:26:59,552
This is the iron law
It is so today

188
00:26:59,841 --> 00:27:02,401
And it will be so tomorrow

189
00:27:02,681 --> 00:27:04,160
What can we do?

190
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,833
We have to think in a sober manner.

191
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:08,710
We need some small farmers

192
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:11,120
Cheap rental, cultivation,
consumer co-operative

193
00:27:11,561 --> 00:27:14,155
funds for the disabled, labour exchange
without politics, handicraft

194
00:27:14,921 --> 00:27:16,240
And first and foremost thriftiness

195
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:21,994
That the Hungarian field workers should
acquire moral capitaland later land.

196
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:24,038
Let me have it!

197
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:32,239
The leaders of the present social system

198
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:35,160
System will never voluntarily improve
the miserable situation of the working class.

199
00:27:36,761 --> 00:27:39,480
The miserable situation of the working class.

200
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:41,559
One has to organize everywhere,

201
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:45,358
So that the power
of the organized workers

202
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,555
can be placed against
the present autocratic system

203
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:50,354
Against the actual power

204
00:27:50,721 --> 00:27:55,954
Then we can create new laws

205
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:57,674
Which will protect the interests
of the workers

206
00:27:58,401 --> 00:28:01,711
And ensure the welfare of the people

207
00:28:01,841 --> 00:28:05,151
I don't want to offend
but if you can't even read?

208
00:28:05,521 --> 00:28:08,166
Don't you think that first
the people have to be raised,

209
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:09,639
and rights should be given later?

210
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:11,314
I'm sorry.

211
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,992
He's Dead!

212
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:21,751
Assassins! Brigands!

213
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:24,715
You killed him.
You killed him!

214
00:30:25,761 --> 00:30:27,991
Get out of here!

215
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:08,236
Only the ignorant fears
and the uneducated frets

216
00:31:08,441 --> 00:31:11,831
The sage learns the nature expects
to be studied, to be approached

217
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:15,121
It slowly opens up its secrets

218
00:31:15,481 --> 00:31:19,269
you learn its laws,
, and the dominating great

219
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:21,359
This was not appreciated by those

220
00:31:21,761 --> 00:31:24,400
Who hindered cognition and knowledge

221
00:31:24,721 --> 00:31:27,918
Those who said you are a heretic
and burnt you by the thousands

222
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:31,272
In the name of superstition
Lying that this is the way to salvation.

223
00:31:31,761 --> 00:31:35,470
Although they are only worried for their
thousand year old power over you.

224
00:31:35,801 --> 00:31:37,678
Nowadays

225
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:40,879
They are still obstructing
knowledge and cognition

226
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:43,590
Because this is their greatest enemy.

227
00:31:43,681 --> 00:31:46,753
Learn man and the acquaintance
with nature will teach you

228
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:49,509
how to rid yourself of your tyrants.

229
00:34:13,121 --> 00:34:17,160
Here is the bread: For it they sin and rebel

230
00:34:17,441 --> 00:34:20,001
But in the evening, fear will descend upon them

231
00:34:20,281 --> 00:34:21,475
And at dawn they will not exist,

232
00:34:22,121 --> 00:34:25,830
And will be trembling in
front of our angry Lord

233
00:35:13,761 --> 00:35:16,355
Rights for the people!

234
00:35:25,921 --> 00:35:28,276
Don't approach Balint!

235
00:35:28,521 --> 00:35:30,432
Are you with the priest?

236
00:35:39,881 --> 00:35:43,954
You're not our brother anymore,
and you are not your own master.

237
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:50,555
I tell you comrades

238
00:35:51,881 --> 00:35:54,793
Don't offend anybody,

239
00:35:55,881 --> 00:35:58,634
Until you've heard what
everyone has to say

240
00:35:58,881 --> 00:36:00,553
A socialist man is open to every thought

241
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:03,753
And is willing to dispute.

242
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:09,829
I don't listen to you, priest,
I don't dispute with a priest

243
00:36:10,161 --> 00:36:13,710
Neither do I... neither do i.

244
00:36:18,921 --> 00:36:23,711
Pastoral letter of His Eminence, Louis,
the Bishop of Csanad, to his misguided flock

245
00:36:23,921 --> 00:36:26,230
If the people move

246
00:36:26,721 --> 00:36:29,394
As if the dissatisfied part
of the earth throbbed

247
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:33,430
It leaves the ungrateful rocks
and becomeshomeless in its soul

248
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:37,920
The ideas of God, country, king and freedom
die out of his bosom

249
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:40,537
My people,
there are those who rob the people.

250
00:36:40,538 --> 00:36:43,154
Here are heretics, pagans, Jews,
and other denominatio

251
00:36:43,441 --> 00:36:46,056
But you, my flock,
did not turn against the guilty,

252
00:36:46,057 --> 00:36:47,514
but against the whole of society

253
00:36:47,841 --> 00:36:52,039
The hungry man
the desperate man

254
00:36:52,481 --> 00:36:55,917
Sees an enemy in everybody who does not starve
and whose members are clad in decent clothes

255
00:36:57,081 --> 00:37:02,314
Come on, stab and cut,
lead the attack of the peasants!

256
00:37:02,601 --> 00:37:11,760
Come on, stab and cut,
lead the attack of the peasants!

257
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:23,713
Save us Lord from orphancy!
Save us Lord!

258
00:39:24,001 --> 00:39:26,561
Save us Lord from widowhood!

259
00:39:26,841 --> 00:39:30,880
Save us Lord from emigration!

260
00:39:31,521 --> 00:39:33,796
From eating the sugar beet

261
00:39:34,001 --> 00:39:35,559
Save us our Lord!

262
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:37,797
From cabbage without meat

263
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:39,958
Save us our Lord!

264
00:39:40,241 --> 00:39:41,435
From starvation

265
00:39:41,721 --> 00:39:43,359
Save us our Lord!

266
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:46,149
From the holes in the boots

267
00:39:46,441 --> 00:39:48,159
Save us our Lord!

268
00:39:48,441 --> 00:39:50,033
Of perforated boots

269
00:39:50,241 --> 00:39:51,754
Save us our Lord!

270
00:39:52,281 --> 00:39:54,600
From carrying it on our back

271
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,159
Save us our Lord!

272
00:39:56,441 --> 00:39:58,113
From slavery

273
00:39:58,201 --> 00:39:59,998
Save us our Lord!

274
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,876
Have you got a weapon, old man?

275
00:40:37,681 --> 00:40:39,797
Rights for the people.

276
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:42,999
Homeland for the workers!

277
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:57,240
Do you remember what you taught us?

278
00:40:57,601 --> 00:40:59,796
Man, never touch a weapon,
a killing, man destroying tool!

279
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:05,758
Because we want to make reality
of the prophecy of Isaiah when he said that

280
00:41:06,201 --> 00:41:08,761
They shall beat their swords into plowshares

281
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:11,271
And the lion shall eat straw like the ox

282
00:41:11,681 --> 00:41:13,273
And there will be no violence between the people

283
00:41:13,801 --> 00:41:14,995
But take this axe now, for us,

284
00:41:15,801 --> 00:41:17,996
For our poverty.

285
00:41:56,521 --> 00:41:58,557
My hand trembles
respected comrades

286
00:41:59,361 --> 00:42:01,886
Not because I fear you
but because tears fell too many times

287
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:05,238
from my eyes and now again.
I turn to you with begging words.

288
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:09,550
Don't forget what you are pushing us
into because of the immaturity of the people

289
00:42:19,001 --> 00:42:22,118
A sober socialist doesn't destroy

290
00:42:22,481 --> 00:42:24,790
Whatever offense we suffered

291
00:42:25,241 --> 00:42:27,755
We should not create confusion

292
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:30,913
Workers, let us organize the peaceful party
and don't rebel

293
00:42:31,321 --> 00:42:34,996
Let us ask for a protective law
from those who can supply it,

294
00:42:35,201 --> 00:42:37,556
but don't create scandal.

295
00:42:37,761 --> 00:42:40,992
The socialist people
means the conscious workers

296
00:42:41,081 --> 00:42:43,720
let us not dirty the name.

297
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:47,114
Forward friends
, under the flag of dear Jesus

298
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:50,160
The help of the brave,

299
00:44:50,961 --> 00:44:56,115
Ends in victory

300
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:58,875
Trust,

301
00:44:59,441 --> 00:45:04,276
For Jesus will come
and He is the commander.

302
00:45:04,561 --> 00:45:07,871
Women
say the blessing, the way you used to.

303
00:45:11,001 --> 00:45:14,676
These have come from the great misery

304
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:18,879
And washed their clothes,

305
00:45:19,001 --> 00:45:21,151
And bleached their clothes

306
00:45:21,481 --> 00:45:22,675
, in the blood of the Lamb

307
00:45:22,961 --> 00:45:26,590
Therefore,
they stand in front of the royal seat of the Lord

308
00:45:27,841 --> 00:45:32,073
And serve Him day and night in his temple

309
00:45:32,561 --> 00:45:35,394
And who sits in the royal seat

310
00:45:35,601 --> 00:45:38,593
Extends his tent over their heads

311
00:45:40,001 --> 00:45:41,798
They do not starve

312
00:45:42,081 --> 00:45:44,117
They do not thirst

313
00:45:47,281 --> 00:45:49,749
The Sun does not scorch them
and nothing else

314
00:45:50,561 --> 00:45:55,271
Because the Lamb,
who sits in the middle of the royal seat,

315
00:45:55,601 --> 00:45:58,752
Lets them graze

316
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:01,919
And the living well of the water carries them

317
00:46:02,201 --> 00:46:04,078
And God wipes all the tears from their eyes.

318
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:42,873
Our Father, in the body of the chairman

319
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:48,074
Hallowed be thy person, through
the respect and devotion towards the people

320
00:46:49,201 --> 00:46:51,954
Socialism, thy kingdom come

321
00:46:52,481 --> 00:46:54,915
Here and all over the world!

322
00:46:55,241 --> 00:46:57,471
Through the respect and devotion
towards the people

323
00:46:57,561 --> 00:46:59,597
The taxes should be less,

324
00:46:59,801 --> 00:47:02,952
Bread should be more and life easier

325
00:47:03,681 --> 00:47:05,399
People,

326
00:47:06,361 --> 00:47:09,353
free yourself from the common
oppressor of human rights

327
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:16,635
For they deserve their punishment
which they drew on themselves

328
00:47:17,321 --> 00:47:21,314
For oppressing rights and equality

329
00:47:22,921 --> 00:47:25,993
Money, let us not into temptation

330
00:47:26,361 --> 00:47:28,829
, for through you, many sell their principles

331
00:47:29,321 --> 00:47:33,109
And join the oppressors of
the people as slaves.

332
00:47:38,361 --> 00:47:41,480
The world of science should enlighten our brains

333
00:47:41,481 --> 00:47:44,314
To accomplish this holy cause!

334
00:47:44,721 --> 00:47:46,552
Amen!

335
00:47:54,441 --> 00:47:56,560
I supplement this Lord's prayer!

336
00:47:56,561 --> 00:48:00,713
Listen! Mates!
The time has come, our time!

337
00:48:01,441 --> 00:48:05,150
Who do not work shall not eat,
from the bread wetted with our sweat.

338
00:48:05,441 --> 00:48:08,194
The land belongs to nobody
but the fruit to everybody

339
00:48:09,241 --> 00:48:11,357
The fruit of the earth belongs to everybody.

340
00:48:12,121 --> 00:48:14,715
The fruit of the earth belongs to everybody.

341
00:49:50,601 --> 00:49:54,514
If anything happens to us,
if we went forever

342
00:49:54,801 --> 00:49:58,919
If you never saw us

343
00:49:59,201 --> 00:50:02,716
Remember: The land belongs
to those who cultivate it

344
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:07,553
Tell those who hide as cowards
behind the back of the infants

345
00:52:08,641 --> 00:52:11,314
That we despise them, They are not Hungarians,

346
00:52:11,721 --> 00:52:17,353
For the Hungarians are chivalrous,
honest, frank and patriotic.

347
00:52:17,521 --> 00:52:19,352
Tell them that I, Aladar Petko-Szautner
sends them the message,

348
00:52:19,641 --> 00:52:21,677
I will not fight against them,

349
00:52:21,961 --> 00:52:25,874
They can go wherever they like,
but they should remember

350
00:52:26,801 --> 00:52:31,192
That Hungarian society will only be gallant
with gallant Hungarian workers

351
00:52:32,961 --> 00:52:36,670
They have ten minutes to retreat!

352
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:41,917
They don't call me - Gendarme,

353
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:46,911
I won't do anything wrong

354
00:52:47,201 --> 00:52:52,355
I won't be a jailer of anybody,

355
00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:57,510
I won't help to skin the people

356
00:52:57,961 --> 00:53:02,751
I wasn't brought up to be a soldier

357
00:53:03,161 --> 00:53:07,996
To serve a miserable government,

358
00:53:08,161 --> 00:53:13,315
I won't be the mercenary of anybody

359
00:53:13,681 --> 00:53:18,436
But the true and faithful fighter for the idea.

360
00:55:51,241 --> 00:55:54,392
Janos Fekete Nagy
Are you approaching us?

361
00:55:57,281 --> 00:55:58,634
I am approaching.

362
00:55:59,201 --> 00:56:02,034
Godparents, are you holding him tightly

363
00:56:02,321 --> 00:56:04,073
We are holding him tightly

364
00:56:04,281 --> 00:56:06,078
Bring him nearer

365
00:56:15,761 --> 00:56:17,752
We brought him nearer.

366
00:56:18,281 --> 00:56:21,114
Janos Fekete Nagy, did you come voluntarily?

367
00:56:21,321 --> 00:56:23,277
Voluntarily.

368
00:56:27,241 --> 00:56:29,994
What were you before?

369
00:56:30,201 --> 00:56:32,874
The oppressor of the people,
a servant of the lords.

370
00:56:33,161 --> 00:56:35,038
What do you want to be?

371
00:56:35,401 --> 00:56:38,234
A faithful colleague.

372
00:56:38,521 --> 00:56:43,072
Repent and confess.

373
00:56:46,281 --> 00:56:49,717
I confess that out of cowardice,
meanness and led

374
00:56:50,361 --> 00:56:53,273
By the promises of a tempting future

375
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:57,476
, I blindly followed the orders
of the people's oppressors

376
00:56:57,881 --> 00:57:00,315
I even engaged in evil affairs

377
00:57:00,881 --> 00:57:03,839
I abandoned my honest work
for a lighter life

378
00:57:04,241 --> 00:57:05,959
, I disowned my own mother

379
00:57:06,361 --> 00:57:07,953
and the working people

380
00:57:08,281 --> 00:57:09,919
People from which i sprang.

381
00:57:10,401 --> 00:57:12,790
Do you feel repentance and sorrow?

382
00:57:13,921 --> 00:57:15,400
Deep repentance and

383
00:57:15,681 --> 00:57:17,956
Sincere regret.

384
00:57:18,241 --> 00:57:19,594
Godparents,

385
00:57:19,801 --> 00:57:23,350
Are you ready to accept the burden of this man

386
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,236
In front of whole workers' society?

387
00:57:26,601 --> 00:57:28,990
We are ready.

388
00:58:53,241 --> 00:58:57,234
Because instead of luck,
We were hit by misfortune,

389
00:58:57,721 --> 00:59:00,040
never mind! Never mind!

390
00:59:00,041 --> 00:59:04,432
Long live the worker,
long live the rights

391
00:59:04,961 --> 00:59:08,556
, long live the workers' society.

392
00:59:08,841 --> 00:59:12,231
We are workers
we have no freedom,

393
00:59:12,521 --> 00:59:16,196
Because instead of luck,
we were hit by misfortune

394
00:59:16,441 --> 00:59:18,830
, never mind! Never mind!

395
00:59:19,001 --> 00:59:22,835
Long live the worker,
long live the rights

396
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:26,750
, long live the workers' society

397
00:59:27,681 --> 00:59:31,674
Put me down, comrades

398
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:35,635
How could I patronize anybody

399
00:59:53,721 --> 00:59:59,512
When I myself am a feeble human

400
01:00:04,001 --> 01:00:06,390
And so are my friends?

401
01:00:10,201 --> 01:00:13,034
How could you take you under my protection?

402
01:00:13,241 --> 01:00:16,039
Me and my friends are well weak

403
01:00:16,561 --> 01:00:21,032
I can only say that the reason
for the misery and tribulations of the people

404
01:00:21,321 --> 01:00:24,518
Is the lack of land
of which it has been deprived

405
01:00:24,801 --> 01:00:26,712
The humanity common goods

406
01:00:27,121 --> 01:00:29,960
The happiness of the people will be restored
by recovering the land

407
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:33,112
The people do not need patronization
but independent action.

408
01:00:33,401 --> 01:00:38,077
Don't believe, comrades, that i and my friends
can accomplish the worldwide work

409
01:00:38,441 --> 01:00:40,750
And equality of wealth

410
01:00:41,161 --> 01:00:45,871
That will be accomplished
by the enlightened people.

411
01:02:49,881 --> 01:02:55,513
...with the butt of the rifle,

412
01:02:56,441 --> 01:02:58,238
And with the hand,

413
01:02:58,361 --> 01:03:01,034
and with bayonet,

414
01:03:12,001 --> 01:03:21,592
And all along, oh, and not for the potatoes
or for the beans

415
01:04:05,881 --> 01:04:10,318
But always hey, hey, hey...
Death has three rules?

416
01:04:10,641 --> 01:04:14,156
First comes a red cart

417
01:04:15,081 --> 01:04:24,513
And under the grass

418
01:04:24,841 --> 01:04:28,675
Hey... There is stupidity
and blind belief,

419
01:04:29,881 --> 01:04:38,471
Janos Szanto is dead

420
01:04:39,641 --> 01:04:41,711
Janos Baksa is dead

421
01:04:41,781 --> 01:04:42,781
And always all along

422
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:51,278
Until the end,

423
01:04:53,841 --> 01:05:04,752
until the final end,

424
01:05:06,121 --> 01:05:07,873
really, really

425
01:05:14,761 --> 01:05:23,920
And there, then, hey...

426
01:05:24,081 --> 01:05:28,393
The stone will be hard

427
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:35,280
And the butter soft,

428
01:05:35,521 --> 01:05:39,150
And there is nothing else,

429
01:05:39,721 --> 01:05:43,873
Anly, and there is nothing else
nothing at all.

430
01:07:47,321 --> 01:07:50,836
I swear by the living God

431
01:07:50,961 --> 01:07:55,159
That I regret my socialist oath

432
01:07:55,681 --> 01:07:57,956
And declare it null and void

433
01:07:58,321 --> 01:08:00,312
I swear that i will never participate

434
01:08:00,841 --> 01:08:03,435
In any movement against the
valid laws and legal order

435
01:08:03,961 --> 01:08:06,316
And will keep clear.

436
01:08:07,001 --> 01:08:10,118
If anybody tries to violate
this oath i will report it to the court

437
01:08:11,081 --> 01:08:12,355
I will report it to the court

438
01:08:17,041 --> 01:08:23,230
So help me God

439
01:08:47,761 --> 01:08:49,991
Comrades! I do not fear such an oath,
because it has no power over me,

440
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:53,079
because it has no power over me

441
01:08:53,961 --> 01:08:56,191
But regard me closely
when i stand in front of you

442
01:08:56,321 --> 01:09:01,076
Watch my eyes, there is only one truth in them,
which I confirm in front of you, however,

443
01:09:02,321 --> 01:09:05,950
I beg you,

444
01:09:06,481 --> 01:09:09,553
Give me strength through your mercy
to be able to disown my comrades and my belief.

445
01:09:09,721 --> 01:09:12,997
Even if you don't answer
look upon me as your good comrade

446
01:09:14,081 --> 01:09:16,037
Who you will always remember.

447
01:09:22,121 --> 01:09:23,554
Mates!

448
01:09:24,361 --> 01:09:33,713
I can return to work, perhaps the wife
and children will survive...

449
01:09:33,921 --> 01:09:37,357
Comrades!
You taught me many good things

450
01:09:37,601 --> 01:09:41,071
But I must say I cannot conceive
the demands of the idea

451
01:09:41,241 --> 01:09:42,435
The chaos, and I quote the Bible:

452
01:09:42,881 --> 01:09:46,430
We run towards destruction

453
01:09:46,961 --> 01:09:49,191
Destruction will ruin the Earth

454
01:09:49,281 --> 01:09:51,954
The Earth will break and shake

455
01:09:52,201 --> 01:09:55,398
Like those who are drunk
and will slide like a shack

456
01:09:55,961 --> 01:09:59,510
His crime will press him

457
01:10:01,161 --> 01:10:06,189
He will fall and never rise

458
01:10:06,721 --> 01:10:10,960
Time born for sorrow, Fog producing wind,

459
01:10:10,961 --> 01:10:15,989
Time born for sorrow, Fog producing wind,

460
01:10:16,641 --> 01:10:20,873
I have been consumed

461
01:10:21,441 --> 01:10:23,955
By this past year

462
01:10:24,361 --> 01:10:27,000
By this past year

463
01:10:27,561 --> 01:10:31,554
Cette trop longue année

464
01:10:32,241 --> 01:10:33,913
Hey, if I...

465
01:10:36,481 --> 01:10:40,076
...knew which road to take

466
01:10:41,201 --> 01:10:46,355
...knew which road to take

467
01:10:46,761 --> 01:10:49,355
I would plough it.

468
01:10:49,801 --> 01:10:52,190
All along,

469
01:10:53,841 --> 01:10:56,594
Until the end

470
01:11:01,121 --> 01:11:03,760
Until the end

471
01:11:04,161 --> 01:11:06,800
Of the end

472
01:11:06,921 --> 01:11:09,600
Really for good.

473
01:11:09,601 --> 01:11:12,434
And then there

474
01:11:13,601 --> 01:11:18,550
Hey, the stone will be hard

475
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:26,795
And the butter soft

476
01:11:34,281 --> 01:11:42,871
And there is nothing else only those.

477
01:12:16,961 --> 01:12:19,236
If an old man goes into the vineyard

478
01:12:19,521 --> 01:12:21,955
Ad finds a nut,

479
01:12:22,281 --> 01:12:25,159
Hepicks it up
and plants it somewhere

480
01:12:25,321 --> 01:12:28,154
He is well aware that
he will not enjoy its fruit

481
01:12:28,601 --> 01:12:30,512
Oly the future generation

482
01:12:31,521 --> 01:12:33,239
I feel like that too.

483
01:12:33,601 --> 01:12:36,991
I know we shall not accomplish
what we are fighting for

484
01:12:38,241 --> 01:12:39,993
But we want to plant

485
01:12:40,881 --> 01:12:43,236
A tree which will bear fruit
for the future.

486
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:23,560
Comrades!! We are empty-handed
against the hangmen of the power

487
01:13:23,881 --> 01:13:26,520
We cannot take revenge
for the blood curdling acts

488
01:13:26,601 --> 01:13:28,910
Don't let us be halted

489
01:13:29,281 --> 01:13:34,514
By the terror and its mercenaries!

490
01:14:36,601 --> 01:14:39,115
I know Joska, you have an order

491
01:14:39,841 --> 01:14:43,675
And if you are given an order
you will even kill your father.

492
01:18:57,361 --> 01:19:02,037
We are workers
we have no freedom

493
01:19:02,241 --> 01:19:05,836
Because instead of luck,
we were hit by misfortune

494
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:08,157
Never mind! Never mind!

495
01:19:08,361 --> 01:19:12,115
Long live the worker,
long live the rights

496
01:19:12,521 --> 01:19:17,720
long live the workers' society!
