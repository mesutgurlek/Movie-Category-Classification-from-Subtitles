00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Alarm?
Yes, I still ringing.

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Have you heard about Professor Gromov?
They say he has what you need.

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Who dares?

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You?

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
- Gromov? Russian? No.
- You?

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What next. No.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You?

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Maybe?

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Bubba?

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Calm down, chief. I have one
guy, he knows everything. Name Hurry.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
- Hurry!
- Hurry! Where Hurry?

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hurry!

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
- Here is Hurry.
- I'm here.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
- What can you do?
- All, Mr. Stump.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
- I am waiting for the order.
- Then in the path.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Here the transmitter. Good luck,
baby.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
"Since my childhood I was an obedient,
Child scrofulous,

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I did not like leprosy,
But he adored orders.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Since then, for me the word chef -
law

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Next, no arguments!

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I have only one deeply convinced
Do not have an opinion!

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
In the battle of personal clothing
Do not be thinking Hurry,

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Boss in favor
I'll go through fire and water.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Always for me the word chef -
law

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Next, no arguments!

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I have only one deeply convinced
Do not have an opinion!

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Sometimes, I'm rebelling
And the chief criticism,

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm trying to argue with him,
But then I wake up.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No, no, for me, the word chef -
law

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Forward! No arguments!

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I have only one deeply convinced
Do not have an opinion! "

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hurry, I - Stump. Do not forget
Professor Gromov.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:57,000
His model is called
"Electronics".

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
ADVENTURE
ELECTRONICS

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The first series

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:22,000
FLIGHT

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Arrived. Proceed to
work.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Wonderful.
Give a few more parties.

45
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
- I'm tired of chess.
- Well, let's talk seriously.

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Do not want to seriously.
Why should I always serious?

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Elik, where are you?

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Elik?

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
- Elik, you hear me?
- Of course, I hear.

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Elik, you behave badly.

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
- To fulfill my desire.
- Elik stop.

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
- Swap. I order.
- You see?

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And I do not want you to me
ordered.

54
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yes.

55
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Elik electronics, I ask
Finally.

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I also ask.

57
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Well, that's win,
win, then ask.

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You mate, Professor Gromov.

59
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
How?

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's incredible.

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And if so?

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It is absolutely accurate.

63
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So it's wonderful.
It's amazing.

64
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
- Here we succeeded.
- So, a victory?

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
- Holiday?
- And what a.

66
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Congratulations, Elik.

67
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And now you have
fulfill their promise.

68
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
- Well, what do you want?
- Be as you are.

69
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I do not understand, put it more precisely.

70
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Always act in their own way.

71
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And do what I please.
In general, be a man.

72
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You know, baby, be a man -
is not quite what you think.

73
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
- You created for other purposes.
- To play chess?

74
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
- To win!
- No. I do not want.

75
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I want to be like everyone else.

76
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
As a boy on TV.

77
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
- Who are you? Mosenergo?
- Superkarding.

78
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Sorry.

79
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
- Be quiet, Masha, quieter.
- Viktor Ivanovich.

80
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Rather, Masha, at the institute.

81
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What happened?

82
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I barely managed to calm him down.
But the results are startling.

83
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Forgive,
I picked you up so early.

84
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Why? I - your assistant.

85
00:07:40,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And the only person
who knows about electronics.

86
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You should not have made him a boy.

87
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And you know, wanted me
communicated with some drawer?

88
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No, I'm not talking about appearance.
But you have so much invested in him,

89
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
that he, excuse me, just
spoiled.

90
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:32,000
However, the boy failed to
glory.

91
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Volobuev? Where Volobuev?
Volobuev!

92
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Electronics - a brilliant invention.
But what will you do with it?

93
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
- I can not imagine.
- Do not you think that he can...

94
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
No. I do not think so.
I am very attached to him.

95
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Odd word, I feel sad because
that he will never become a man.

96
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
- Are you sure you do not get?
- Electronics! This is his legs.

97
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
- Where did he come from?
- From the camel.

98
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Can not be. I have a right
confiscated. Viktor Ivanovich!

99
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Electronics, you act
wrong.

100
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I never expected from you such
illogical behavior.

101
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And you, okay? Who promised
fulfill my wish?

102
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Understand, you're asking the impossible.

103
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I want to become a man, what
is impossible?

104
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Sit, Victor Ivanovich
Sit. I can not drive a car.

105
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Electronics, now we
let's talk seriously.

106
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
- Elik, you must understand!
- I understand you do not want to help me.

107
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
- And you too?
- Come on down, nasty boy!

108
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Elik what are you going?

109
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Goodbye, I'll come back when
become a real person.

110
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:04,000
- Back after him! Hurry!
- I'm not a racer. I - scientist!

111
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Electronic!

112
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
- Well, lad.
- What guy? What a guy?

113
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
- Listen, you're doing what?
- Electronics - a boy

114
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
just as real, but doeth
God knows what!

115
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Think, boy.

116
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Do not grab it right away, not enough
it immediately.

117
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Find out first, as he
managed.

118
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Find out how he managed
first.

119
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:06,000
- I do not understand, repeat.
- Find out where his button!

120
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Where is the button where the button and find
would be where he is.

121
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
- Boy, who are you?
- Electronics.

122
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
- Who?
- Electronics.

123
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
- Victor! That's yours.
- Come on, come here. Hold.

124
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You instead Volobuyeva? Sit
rather, starting.

125
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
No buts. Rescue team
necessary, we human beings can not.

126
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
- Man?
- Well, of course.

127
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Come on, hurry, hurry, hurry.
Go!

128
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
- Where is he?
- Do not know.

129
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes.

130
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Stop, stop.

131
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:31,000
- We'll have to wait.
- Well, well, well.

132
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
- We lost Electronics.
- Nothing, Viktor Ivanovich.

133
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Wherever Elik not proved, he
necessarily betray himself.

134
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
- Yes. Unfortunately, you're right.
- Sorry?

135
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Understand, this is not the usual
boy

136
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
which is burst into tears of failure.
If he does not understand, he is satisfied

137
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
that failed...

138
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Well, what then?

139
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Electronics can die.
That is why it is urgently necessary to find.

140
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Let us turn to the police?

141
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
From left Professor robot.
Can you imagine what will happen?

142
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Why, in fact, a robot, but
Viktor Ivanovich?

143
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Elik Gromov - your nephew.

144
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
A? Do you have his photo?

145
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
- Yes, here.
- Well?

146
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh, that Elik in the magazine?

147
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
No, he can not smile
for photo I made appearance.

148
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:47,000
- And the boy?
- I do not even know his name.

149
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:58,000
- Sergei! So that was home for supper!
- Yes I will!

150
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:08,000
There Gusev.

151
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Hello, Syroezhkin.

152
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
- Hello, Gusev.
- Well, like, cheese eating or not eating?

153
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
- Go you.
- Are you with us today who? Syroushkin?

154
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Or Soronozhkin?

155
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Syropopkin.

156
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
- Oh you just Gus.
- What?

157
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:44,000

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You and I were lucky.

188
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I never lie. I can develop
speed of 300 kilometers per hour.

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Why are you sitting there? You

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You see, I want to become

212
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
- Everything! Mama!
- My mother has nothing to do with it.

213
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
- Of all the above must choose.
- I will not!

214
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
This is closer to the truth.

215
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
- Well, I go?
- Goodbye.

216
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Thank you.

217

He is no more.

218
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Listen, friend, forgive me, myself
you know, it happens.

219
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
- You want to be a friend?
- Ask. Legally.

220
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Of course.

221
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:29,000

Beautiful work. Exact

227
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So it is closed.

228
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Come.

You know, this is somehow bad

And how well?

231
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And that's it!

232
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Mike, let's go to the movies today?

233
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'd love to, but I
to three tickets dogs need.

234
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Do you understand? Now everything is in our
hands.

235
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Understood. But you tell me
how to act.

236
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Okay. Right with me.

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Well, what are you? Come, come.

238
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Well, how?

- I like it.

240
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
My father and I wanted out of this barn
garage to do. A car yet.

241
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Like. It is full of all
stuff, take what you want.

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000

246
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
what I eat or sleep. And more
all, I do not like to drink water,

247
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
She then gurgles.

248
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yes, they'll be into something to wear.

249
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Here you are.

250
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You're only sorry, here
nothing more, but they are dirty.

251
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It does not matter.

252
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Well, you give.

253
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
- Very easy homework.
- Hello. What more do you know how?

254
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Misc. While little, but I quickly
teach

255
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
After all, learning - this is the most
nice, right?

256
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
How to say.
Hey, Come wait.

257
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000

258

Oh, wow.

262
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Just look how cool.

263
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
- El, we've done in such cases!
- What?

264
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I do not know yet.

265
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Listen, we're sure
to invent something.

266
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000

That's all done. "

268
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Never mind. I glued so that no
be noticeable.

269
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Well, that, E, I did it out of you
Rights? Will you say no?

270
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
- No.

271
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
- When?
- Yes, even now.

272
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You see, everything is very simple,
want to be a man - be.

273
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
- What a strange formula.
- My.

274
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
- And what does it mean?
- Well, what?

275
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Rise and shine, in anything myself

We - young children.
We want to walk.

283
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And we are told that cathet
Short hypotenuse

284

And I say to you: "Enough,
I'm tired of this burden. "

285
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Sum of the hypotenuse.

286
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm tired of this burden.

287
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000

We - young children.
We want to walk.

291
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And we say: "Athens
The war went to Sparta,

292
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And I say: "Leave
I want to hurry the party! "

293
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
The war went to Sparta.

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Leaving soon would desk.

And we are told that the Volga
It flows into the Caspian Sea,

And I say that long
Do not stand this grief!

301

To become, say, a man
Stepping need to keep pace with the times,

302
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,000
We do not want to walk,

303
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
- Well, do you understand my formula.
- No, do not understand.

304
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Well, idiot.

Okay, then you'll understand.

- What is it?
- Dogs, friends of man.

307
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
You know, I read in books;
looked at the pictures,

308
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
but I never thought that they
such.

309
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Ordinary dogs.

310
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Listen, they are afraid of me. Why?

311
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Look, look.

312
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
- I comb it every morning.
- Hey, girl, come to us here,

313
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Give us a dog.

314
00:28:47,000 --> 00:29:01,000
- See?
- Well, do not we eat it. Come on!

315
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Now. Viktor Ivanovich, from
police.

316
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Yes, yes, I listen.

317
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
The park has seen the two boys
similar to your nephew.

318
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
How?

319
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Do not know. You are asked not
delay. Sort it out themselves.

320
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Yes, yes, now, quickly.
In the park? Two?

321
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
- Two?
- Do not, Masha.

322
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Going to the park.

323
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Moving. About the button is not
forget.

324
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
- Oh, what a dog.
- Guys, do not touch the dog.

325
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Put your hands. But leave me alone you from
me.

326
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Guys, Leave me alone.

327
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
See? Did you see what happens?

328
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Okay, go out, give
those that disappeared,

329
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
and say: "Hello, I'm
Syroezhkin.

330
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Yes, but...

331
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,000
- What, but?
- I speak only the truth.

332
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Okay, get out, give them
and ducked out to come here

333
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I'll go.

334
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
- And this will be a man?
- What do you think?

335
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Girls must be protected?
Well, come on, come on, well.

336
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Stop, I want you to
leave the girl alone

337
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
and left the place.

338
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
- And the more you do not want?
- I have one wish.

339
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
- But to you it is not relevant.
- What? And in the ear is not it?

340
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
- No, spank.
- Boy, Run!

341
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Why?

342
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Shoo! There's more!

343
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Come on, come here!

344
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
- Are you cool you do it.
- I was supposed to help you.

345
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Yes. Thank you.

346
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
What's the name of my savior?

347
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:20,000
- Come here. Go.
- Excuse me. One second.

348
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Hush, Martic, well, quieter.

349
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Sergei Syroezhkin.
I am, it looked like they were there.

350
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
- Well?
- Procedure. Tide.

351
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Oh, sorry, ran away.

352
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
He's here. I can take.

353
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
A button found?

354
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
- And where did you learn to fight?
- Yes, so somehow.

355
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
- Simply amazing.
- It somehow turns.

356
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
- Invite?
- Never.

357
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Peace and goodwill,
otherwise he would not compromise.

358
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I wish you good health.

359
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
- Are you in a school study?
- In the 42nd.

360
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Hello, I'm in the forty-fourth,
close.

361
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And in what class?

362
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So, Maria, for me, I see it.

363
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
- What's your name?
- My name is Maya Svetlova.

364
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Yes.

365
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Go!

366
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Just tell me about you, but then somehow
funny.

367
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:58,000
- Where is he? A? Where?
- Oh, here he is! Hurry!

368
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Two.

369
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:15,000
- What happened Hurry?
- Nothing, nothing.

370
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Oh, sorry.

371
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
- Viktor Ivanovich.
- What?

372
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Oh, all I do not take it anymore.

373
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Oh, Momma.

374
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
- And you did not see the second?
- Do not have time.

375
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Pity. That policeman said
that they are very similar.

376
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
- It seemed to him.
- No, I do not think.

377
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
- And what if they met?
- Elik and the guy with the photos?

378
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Professor, it's not logical, it is
contrary to any theory.

379
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Elik himself against any
theory.

380
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
You'll see, we now
be such a surprise!

381
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
- Citizens, can you read?
- Yes. Why?

382
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
- Here, Masha, listen...
- Professor, you're an idealist.

383
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:22,000
If you are sober and realistic
look at these things...

384
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
- Well, you see me today and shook.
- Tired?

385
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Yes, okay.

386
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Sergey, what's wrong?

387
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
His head does not stay, but still
problems in algebra.

388
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:51,000
- Give your problem.
- Yes?

389
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
84, 85.

390
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
- The first response -40, -4 second.
- It's that. I need a solution.

391
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
- In the notebook. My handwriting.
- Good. I will copy each letter.

392
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Yes? Really? Well, come on, do it.
Only when you do, wake up,

393
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:24,000
and then I have to go home.

394
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Well, what about you?

395
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Go on.

396
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And you?

397
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Hey, listen, tell me where
train?

398
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
- Well, what you see?
- In general, yes. I did not expect.

399
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Now you'll know. Understand?

400
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Well, tell me where?

401
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
The system of yoga. With five years.

402
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
- You mean that? A?
- "Wait a minute.

403
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
- What you before?
- It was impossible.

404
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Anger accumulated.

405
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Here.

406
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
So, so, so, well, well.

407
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Wait a minute.

408
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
- Tell me, are you all by himself nareshal?
- Sam.

409
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Originally, very original.
Tell me, dear, what have you got?

410
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Wait a minute, you all now
answer. Warning

411
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Give me a piece of chalk, please.
You can go into place.

412
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
S., tell me, please, that
have you got a number?

413
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Well, bolder, S., boldly.

414
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Well. But you have to put this
all solution. Please bolder.

415
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
- Serge, we are waiting for you.
- Prompt him.

416
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Integral, integral.

417
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Integral!

418
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Intregal.

419
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Intregal.

420
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:14,000
S., well, how can you?
What intregal?

421
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Hello, Sergei. I'm sorry,
but I have not had time to finish everything here.

422
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Why are you?

423
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
You do not like?

424
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,000
No, thanks, but, you know, if
someone sees you, will be inconvenient.

425
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Maybe remove it?

426
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And I then did, and moped
mended.

427
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Moped?

428
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And the clutch done? Well, you
master! Well, thank you.

429
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:00,000
This, of course, all is well
Only now...

430
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Why deuce? After the decision
was correct.

431
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Bet! Taratara even jumped.
Very original solution!

432
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
- So what's the matter?
- These are your integrals.

433
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I shall never forget. Now, even in
Do not go to school.

434
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Two! At the end of the year!
The mother will eat me now!

435
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
- How does it eat?
- Well, to cut will be.

436
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:37,000
You know what, if I am wrong,
let me and nags.

437
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,000
- Listen, you learn to love?
- Yes.

438
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Exactly. Tomorrow you go to school
instead of me. Twos fix.

439
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:58,000
But you know, I can not
call myself Syroezhkin.

440
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:07,000
With you nothing but trouble. What is not
come up with something wrong, it's not some sort.

441
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Well, wait a minute.

442
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Come here.

443
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Help. Dana Electronics is
that it replaces Sergei Syroezhkin.

444
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Well.

445
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:36,000
And the gates do not need anything.

446
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Come on, after helping. From there, the whole
class seen.

447
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Well, you give. I can not
get used to your tricks.

448
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
- Instructions remember?
- Yes.

449
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Well, then, come on, move.

450
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Hello, "Intregal.

451
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
- What are you, Syroega?
- Do not bother me.

452
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Understandably. Yoga.

453
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Pose Sphinx.

454
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Come, sit down, sit fast,
sat, who they say. Sat.

455
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:47,000
A greasy.

456
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
And why?

457
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
- Hello, hello, boys.
- Hello!

458
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Sit down, sit down.

459
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
That gives.

460
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Iron small.

461
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
You want to fix a deuce?

462
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I can give 20 evidence
Pythagorean theorem.

463
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Are you joking?

464
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
You can start?

465
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
- Look, Pythagoras remembered.
- Exactly. You could have Gorapifa blurt.

466
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
About Pythagoras, we know little,
He lived in the sixth century BC,

467
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:47,000
and established a mathematical
school. The proof of the first.

468
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
The method of addition.

469
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
The method of decomposition.

470
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
The method of parquet.

471
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
And, finally, the bride's table.

472
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And now let me give you
yesterday's decision problem.

473
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Since the integrals without integrals
and coordinate system.

474
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It's just amazing, just
amazing.

475
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Good luck, academician.

476
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:28,000
It's amazing.

477
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Well, okay.
Well, that's for you too.

478
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Long enough for you. Well.

479
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Here it is! Freedom!

480
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
"Until then came the progress
Before unseen miracles

481

He dropped to the depths
And he went up to heaven.

482
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Forgotten trouble
Stopped running,

483
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Injected robots
And not a man.

484
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Until then came the progress
Physical labor has disappeared,

485
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Yes, and mental replace
Mechanical process.

486
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Forgotten trouble
Stopped running,

Injected robots
And not a man.

Until then came the progress
It was time to spare,

489
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Now, take a walk through the world
Would you like the song, want not.

490
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Forgotten trouble
Stopped running,

491
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Injected robots
Happy is the man! "

492
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Guys, today we have a free
theme. Draw what everyone wants.

493
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Just quiet. Okay? All
All clear? Yes?

494
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Please, can begin.

495
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Sergei!

496
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Why did you run away then from
park? Offended?

497
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
No, I'm not offended. For me
pursued.

498
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
- Chase?
- Yes, but do not talk about it.

499
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,000
- And where are you now going?
- At a training session. Competition soon.

500
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
And yet, who?

501
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Some other time.
Would you like to meet after school?

502
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Well, okay.

503
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Good, good.

504
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Come on.

505
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
What is this?

506
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
- Well, why did you, Serge?
- Just that you were well lit.

507
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Thank you, Serge. I put
you four.

508
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
- Why four?
- Hush, hush, boys, hush.

509
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And why. Very nice
drawing. Listen, Syroezhkin,

510
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Give it to me, but I'll hang it
the wall.

511
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
- The figure is inaccurate.
- What?

512
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I mean, you glossed over life
a true artist

513
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
must be truthful.

514
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
- I love you why the school sent?
- Over five.

515
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
What's this?

516
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
- I wanted the best, but it...
- And she, she, it?

517
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:03,000
A true artist must
be truthful.

518
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Well, okay, so be it,
for the first time I forgive you.

519
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Listen, go and get some home
instead of me.

520
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
And then, awaken each morning
without doing anything, ask about school,

521
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
In general, replaced me completely.
Want?

522
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I.

523
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Hey, Al, wait.

524
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
You're only going to wear me not
forget.

525
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
- Why?
- Well, I can not like you.

526
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:42,000
All right.

527
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
- Hello, I came home from school.
- Well, dinner in the kitchen.

528
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Thank you. I just wash my hands
and dressed.

529
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,000
What?

530
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Quiet!

531
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Started.

532
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Well, well.

533
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Let one.

534
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Kukushkin.

535
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Smirnov.

536
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
- Lev Leshchenko.
- Korolkov.

537
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Attention.

538
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
- Muslim Magomayev.
- Gusev. Come to the instrument.

539
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I? Now. Hold me.

540
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Please.

541
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
What's the matter, Gusev?
Deploy and recover.

542
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
See? You have the same voice as
pipe. Come on, come on, come on.

543
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I'm hearing no.

544
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,000
- All there is, but hearing no.
- Can I?

545
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Syroezhkin?

546
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:18,000
- Well, try.
- What is it?

547
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Do not "and".

548
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:30,000
- Silence.
- Please first.

549
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Well, well.

550
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Silence. Calm down.

551
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:44,000
"In the month of April, a young
In the old park is melting snow,

They begin their run.

553
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Forgotten everything,
My heart sank in my chest

554
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Only sky, only the wind,
Only joy ahead.

555

Only sky, only the wind,
Only joy ahead.

Unaware barriers

Have you heard? Again yoga.

After all, it is not forever,

Congratulations, congratulations, now

- Well, what's new?
- Today, only singing.

579
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
By singing.

Hey, what is it?

581
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I mean, I sang a voice
Robertino Loreti.

- What are Lobretti?
- Italian.

583
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
For this song he came
more than others.

584
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
- Well, there are other?
- Caruso, Tito Rocco, Chaliapin.

585
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Chaliapin.

586
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Professor Gromov very
loves music.

587
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,000
What are you doing? Sick or what?

588
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I'm still here Chaliapin not enough.

589
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
- Well, I went.
- Wait. Tell me how it all.

00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
- Where?
- Well, how, where, at school, at home?

591
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
- I have no time, my guys are waiting.
- What other guys?

00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Korolkov, Smirnov, Gusev.

Clear. Caution.

00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Caution.

- Ronya!
- Beware!

599
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Where to put?

600
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Over there. No, wait.

601
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:05,000
No, let's say.

602
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
- Are you a long time so you can?
- No, I did recently.

603
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:16,000
What is it? Cast up!
Attention! Extend the lesson.

604
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
A phenomenon Syraezhkin...

605
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:31,000
... I will explore after
classes.

606
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Hello

607
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

608
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
- Explore, please.
- Maya Svetlova.

609
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Korolkov.

610
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
- Smirnov.
- Very nice.

611
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:21,000
No, no, well, what you do.

612
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Viktor Ivanovich, you without me
die of hunger.

613
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
- Well, that found the double?
- Not yet.

614
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
- But the photo was taken in our city.
- Very interesting.

615
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Very interesting. Yes, bad
we are predictors.

616
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Betray himself, it took several
days, and about him not hearing, nor spirit.

617
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,000
- Why are you so happy, eh?
- What do you mean?

618
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Electronic mastered in
our complex world.

619
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
And he is not alone, he obviously someone
helps.

620
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
He found his comrades
they understand each other.

621
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,000
- Do you understand? I see.
- I understand, let's eat.

622
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,000
You talk as if
conducting an experiment.

623
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I was just worried about the fate
Elika.

624
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I wonder who is with him.

625
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Yes, this guy certainly
knows where his button.

626
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Hurry? What a guy, Hurry?

627
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,000
- Double. I reported to you.
- Find it. Urgently.

628
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:39,000
We are looking for.

629
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Listen, speak only the truth,
why the stars light up?

630
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
You know, this question
short answer is very difficult.

631
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I do not know a lot to explain.

632
00:57:52,000 --> 00:59:09,000
- And I thought, you know everything.
- No. Come on, talk on the road.

633
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Well, electronics, well, friend.
Ah, still did not bring lunch.

634
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Where, then, is what is, eh?

635
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Come on. Now again
compete. In my opinion, good.

636
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I just like it.
In my opinion perfectly. So. Come on.

637
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
- Examples. Check. Like it?
- Please.

638
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:01,000
And the fashionable, and color is good, and
inexpensive. No, really, please?

639
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,000
- It is true that much.
- Scarecrow.

640
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Yes, Serge, has long wanted to ask,
Have you seen a textbook on Latin?

641
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I took him to read.

642
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
One of you I have left.

643
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
- Is it possible?
- Can. Well, what was interesting?

644
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,000
You bet. You know, it turns
number of words that we say

645
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I have Latin roots. Except
that is a very beautiful language.

646
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
- I'm sure he will learn.
- How to learn?

647
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
According to your textbook. And you
No other textbooks?

648
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
- What?
- Spanish, Greek, Swahili.

649
01:00:43,000 --> 01:01:12,000
- Swahili?
- Of course. It's very interesting.

650
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Hey, you sleepy woodcocks,
open the door of my father.

651
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:21,000
S., Pope arrived.

652
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
- What are you on the chain has closed?
- Someone with a lock dabbled.

653
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Nonsense. Change that.

654
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,000
- As the son doing?
- Do Catkins? All right.

655
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,000
- Before all was lost in the garage.
- And we have a castle will change.

656
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And now, some five, at home
sits, reads books

657
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
imagine, Latin carried away.

658
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:49,000
- Latin? And not buzit?
- Very surprised.

659
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:56,000
So, you say, some
Five? Listen, there is an idea.

660
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Serega.

661
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:08,000
You say now an A student?
Do you remember that I promised you?

662
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Come, let's go.
I am going to show you places!

663
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I am in school right.

664
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
S., dad one day
come, go, eh?

665
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:47,000
But it is not pedagogically.

666
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Sorry, I did not come on time,
mother took the store. Fives 6.

667
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:58,000
He studied English, dulled by
Spanish and Greek.

668
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Grinding!

669
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Daddy!

670
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Daddy!

671
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:20,000
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you standing there, as
post, then hung around his neck.

672
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Shake. There.

673
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:33,000
- How to post? When?
- I was in school should be in school should be.

674
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Also my boyfriend, mood
changes like the weather in autumn,

675
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
go, no go.

676
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I do not want to.

677
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
What?

678
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
- We are ready.
- Please.

679
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:58,000
- Can I still go to school?
- Well, come on, stay, come on, come on.

680
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:16,000
- Hey, what happened to him today?
- Unaccustomed.

681
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Sergei, why do not you go? I
also saw how you sat in the car.

682
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Went.

683
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:54,000
"Rustling much rain
drizzling,

684
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,000
My soul is in trouble and anguish.

685
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I'm a man, in my opinion,
hopeless,

686
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Why am I making plans for the sand?

687
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Thickened over me evil
clouds

688
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And suddenly I was out of work.

689
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Well, why I'm so unlucky?

690
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Well, why suffering - my
inheritance?

691
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Nobody is interested,

692
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
To my forever ruined
fate

693
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I got bitten for progress

694
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:50,000
And this terrible helped itself.

695
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Where to run and where to look for luck?

696
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,000
She hid herself in what region?

697
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I can not sing, I'm afraid now
pay,

698
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:16,000
And in other matters, sing a song my own. "

699
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Castle changed.

700
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:50,000
What am I now get lost
what? I am a man or a man?

701
01:06:50,000 --> 01:07:03,000
And here, too.

702
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:08,000
- Who's there?
- It's me. I, Sergei.

703
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Sergei long home, go home,
boy.

704
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
- Who is it?
- A boy of some hooligans.

705
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Yes? Well, now I have his ears Nader.
Right now I catch him,

706
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I'll beat him now.

707
01:07:42,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Sergey, where are you?

708
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Open, I'm the same person.

709
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I have the right to...

710
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
- Viktor Ivanovich?
- Yes?

711
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I found a double. This Sergei
Syroezhkin of the forty-fourth school.

712
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
- To bring it to you?
- No, no, in any case.

713
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
And do not go his eyes,
but then again he would escape.

714
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Viktor Ivanovich, why are you
think that this is electronics?

715
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
No, I just do not rule
such a possibility.

716
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:51,000
That way, you get to know
his class teacher

717
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:59,000
and learn everything about Syroezhkin. I
sure that the electronics somewhere nearby.

718
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I learned the name of a clone.
Through him, I hope to go to the robot.

719
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,000
- Long fidgeting, Hurry.
- Maybe you would like it?

720
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
- I carry out the order, chief.
- Do not be cross. About the button is not forgotten?

721
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:31,000
She is my dream.

722
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:39,000
One is.

723
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
And here is the second.

724
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Well, what are you staring at?
Syroezhkin - it's me.
