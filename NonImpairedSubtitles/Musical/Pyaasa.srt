1
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:44,028
These smiling flowers

2
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:49,033
These fragrant gardens

3
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:54,038
These world filled..

4
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:59,041
..with glorious colors

5
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:28,073
The nectar intoxicates the bees

6
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:52,097
What little have l
to add to this splendor..

7
00:03:53,199 --> 00:04:01,106
Save a fear tears a few sighs

8
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,110
I told you to
keep the place tidy.

9
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:12,116
If that manuscript was here,
then where has it got to?

10
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,122
What do you know then?
- He wished you good morning.

11
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,125
Fool! I mean about
the manuscript?

12
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,128
You've looked at my things?

13
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,132
Wings?

14
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:32,136
This is a newspaper
office, not a birdhouse!

15
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,138
Wings, indeed!

16
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:39,141
Things, Have you read
the poem I left?

17
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,141
I have.

18
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,147
Did you like them?
You'll publish them?

19
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,151
Why should l?
I haven't lost my mind.

20
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:51,155
Call this gibberish poetry? It's
a crusade against unemployment.

21
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:58,163
Poetry deals with delicacies.
You must write poems about love.

22
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,165
You are incomparable, Sir!

23
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,164
Write about intoxications..

24
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,172
..the beauty of a cup,
or a fine woman.

25
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,177
Shut up. You don't write poetry.

26
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,177
Have you read poets
like Mir and Momin?

27
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:21,185
Yes, and Josh and Faiz too, who
are beyond your comprehension.

28
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,188
Give me my poems.
- We will find them later.

29
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:36,201
What do you think
you're doing, young man?

30
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:46,210
What right have you
to throw away my poems?

31
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:50,214
Should I make a
paper hat of them?

32
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,217
Don't insult them by
wearing them on a hollow head.

33
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,220
My head? Hollow?

34
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:01,225
How about yours?
If you're a poet, I'm a donkey!

35
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,230
Its clear and its
nice to hear you admit it.

36
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,245
Are you weighing
vegetables or gold?

37
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,252
There's uncle Vijay!

38
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,278
I've caught him

39
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:09,293
I'm not your enemy.
Why run from your mother?

40
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:15,299
Where have you been?
I can't bear to see your suffer.

41
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,303
I'm well; mother.

42
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:23,307
Sure you are.
Just look the state you're in.

43
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:30,315
Come home. I've hidden
away some good food for you.

44
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,319
You've found him? - Yes.

45
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,340
Well, mother.
So your poet is home!

46
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,345
Every literate
fool thinks he's poet.

47
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,351
Where else can he
get food as a parasite?

48
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,354
Take no notice of them. Eat.

49
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:20,364
See? We earn and mother
feed delicacies to her lay about.

50
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,368
He's shameless.

51
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:29,373
If he had any self-respect,
he'd starve rather than eat here.

52
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,383
Shut up, you two! I won't
hear a word said against him.

53
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:44,388
He's back after so long, and
you can't bear to see him eat.

54
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:49,393
He's hale and hearty. Why
doesn't he earn and not burden us?

55
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,398
He is your brother. His father
died, you should look after him.

56
00:08:55,501 --> 00:09:01,406
It wasn't our wish that our
parents produce such a lay about.

57
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,412
That I must have to hear this!

58
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,416
It was my misfortunate to
give birth to you two.

59
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,420
You won't even let me work,
because of your 'prestige'.

60
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,426
If I could work as a maid,
I could feed my son.

61
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,433
Sister-in-law,
where are my poems?

62
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,436
Address me, not the women.

63
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,439
I sold it for
10 annas waste papers.

64
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:49,454
Waste papers?
You sold my poems for 10 annas?

65
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,458
Uncouth fools no better.

66
00:09:56,562 --> 00:10:00,464
You call me uncouth?
Did you hear that, brother?

67
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:09,474
I got rid of them this morning,
Now I'll get rid of you! Out!

68
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,478
Son.

69
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:19,483
Where will you go on an empty
stomach? Who will tend to you?

70
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,487
You take me along with you.

71
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,490
I don't want to stay
here for another minute.

72
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,495
Don't worry mother
I'll do my best.

73
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,501
I'll take you away
from here as soon as I can.

74
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,518
Let me get on with my work
instead of searching waste papers.

75
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,522
But there was an important file.

76
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,525
A file containing
hand written papers?

77
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,529
Where are they?
- A woman brought them.

78
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:13,538
They caught her eye, she
read some then she took them away.

79
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,536
Which women?
Where does she live?

80
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,542
I don't know
she wasn't a local I person.

81
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,554
If she comes again, I'll ask.

82
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,567
Come, come!

83
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,570
Have you fallen out
with your brother again?

84
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:52,576
Are you hungry?
You'll starve to death.

85
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,580
Well, today I got
20 bucks from a rich man.

86
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:02,586
His car ran over a women's leg.
I gave false witness for him.

87
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,592
Shyam, remember how you
found a lame sparrow as a kid.

88
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,597
You cared for it
until it was better.

89
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,600
It was only a kid.

90
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,604
But you are still a kid.

91
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:33,677
Lament not..

92
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,683
..if I turn my face away.

93
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:46,690
Your gaze is filled.

94
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:51,695
With such longing.

95
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,702
Listen.

96
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,709
I was saying..

97
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,713
Who know what you said?

98
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:13,717
Who knows what I heard?

99
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,721
Some thing stirred in my heart.

100
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:24,729
Who knows what you said..?
Who knows what I heard?

101
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,734
Something stirred in my heart.

102
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:11,766
I felt my heart awaken.
I felt such elation.

103
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:20,785
Slumbering dreams reawakened,
something stirred in my heart.

104
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:24,788
Who knows what you said?

105
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,791
Who knows what I heard?

106
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:32,796
Something stirred in my heart.

107
00:15:56,922 --> 00:16:10,825
I stumble no more,
my feet no longer falter.

108
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:19,844
There is new life in my step,
something stirred in my heart.

109
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,847
Who knows what you said?

110
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,851
Who knows what I heard?

111
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:31,855
But something sure
stirred in my heart.

112
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:16,891
The cascade of my hair
is filled with sweet fragrance.

113
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:21,905
Doors open to
reveal secret longings.

114
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:25,909
Something stirred in my heart.

115
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,912
Who knows what you said.

116
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,916
Who knows what I heard.

117
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,920
Something stirred in my heart.

118
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,948
Excuse me.. - Yes.

119
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,952
That song you were singing..
- You like it?

120
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,955
Where did you get it?

121
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,959
It's mine.

122
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,963
It isn't yours.
- Then why ask if you know.

123
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:23,965
Because l.. - What do you want?

124
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,972
The file with that song in it.

125
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,975
Is that all?

126
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,974
I don't like prattle.

127
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,981
Do you like me?

128
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,985
No.

129
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,984
Then why follow me?

130
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,990
I want to know only that
the file is with you or not?

131
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,993
It's valuable to me.
Whenever I have money.

132
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:55,999
So you followed me
empty handed? Get out!

133
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,002
Please understand.
I want only that file.

134
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,005
For me it is important.

135
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,008
You go, or should
I remove my sandal?

136
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,020
Stop shouting, silly.
Your customer will run away.

137
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:21,024
I papered I lured him here,
but he hasn't penny.

138
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,050
Juhi, it was him.

139
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,053
Gulabo, where are you running?

140
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:56,059
I must apologize to him,
I treated him very badly.

141
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:12,075
Stop talking in riddles
and tell me in plain words.

142
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,078
What's all this about?

143
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:20,083
The man who
followed me is a poet.

144
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:27,090
The poet whose poems
I have bought as waste paper.

145
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:30,093
Look: the same paper,
the same writing.

146
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,096
And I threw him out as a pauper.

147
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,105
He is the pauper.
You did the quite right thing.

148
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:49,112
Foolish girl.  Come on!

149
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,191
Have you written
any poems in the holidays?

150
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:10,192
A few.

151
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,197
Anyone can write poems. If you're..
..a true poet, create something.

152
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,198
Extempore?

153
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,209
But on what subject.

154
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,216
Who is she?

155
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:36,216
There's your subject:
a poem about her.

156
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:46,229
When I walk even my
shadows lag behind.

157
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:53,236
When you walk,
the universe keeps pace.

158
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,241
When I stop
clouds of misery gather.

159
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:05,248
When you stop..
spring radiance is outshone.

160
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:42,285
Miss Pushlata.

161
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:30,394
Our love will
survive every trial.

162
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:41,405
We shall never
forget our oath of love.

163
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:02,426
We leave the
world far behind.

164
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:08,431
How long will
be the journey together?

165
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,483
Coolie!

166
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,495
A coolie at your service.

167
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,502
Put these in the car.

168
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,509
What has the world come to?

169
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,508
The educated work as coolies.

170
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,545
Have you got money?

171
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:03,545
No credit.

172
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,560
It's counterfeit.

173
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,573
Say you've got nothing else.

174
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:34,577
Say that's your game!

175
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,581
Now who'll pay for the
food you have touched?

176
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,588
Keep the food.

177
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:55,596
Go to a barber and get
yourself made to look more human.

178
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:12,615
I'm not hungry - Yes, you are.

179
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,619
You have no right to
take pity on me.

180
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:26,629
I'm sorry..

181
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:29,629
.. take no notice of me.

182
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,636
You have every
right to be angry.

183
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:37,640
I treated you very
badly the other day.

184
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,645
I've nothing against you.

185
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:45,648
Then please eat..

186
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,651
.. for my sake.

187
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,656
What did you say? For your sake?

188
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,661
You don't even know me.

189
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,664
I know you very well - How?

190
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:05,668
Through your poems.

191
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:08,671
I know your
thoughts and feelings.

192
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:11,674
What else is there?

193
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,679
I don't understand.

194
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,685
But, miss.

195
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,684
Why address me so politely?

196
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,690
I am not used to.

197
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:35,698
Until today,
people have spoken rudely to me.

198
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:40,703
I have suffered
their vulgar remarks..

199
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:44,705
..their abuse,
their crude jokes.

200
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,712
But you behave so respectfully.

201
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,772
Massage, oil massage
make things gleam!

202
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:54,777
If your head reels with pain
or your heart sinks in gloom.

203
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:02,786
..don't fret leave it to me.
I'll set things right soon.

204
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:07,790
Massage, oil massage!

205
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:35,818
The lotion I use has the magic.
Curing baldness and dandruff.

206
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,823
Once my hands begin to whirl
your hair your fate will change.

207
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:55,838
Mark my words, my friends,
this lotion brings joy.

208
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:10,843
It cures thousands of ailments,
so why you not give a try?

209
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:43,886
Suffering a lovers tiff?
Is your business in throes?

210
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:48,891
A touch of this supple
hand will dissipate all woes.

211
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:11,904
Mark my words, my friends,
this lotion brings joy.

212
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:51,954
Be you a master, be you a slave.
Be you a leader or the public.

213
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:57,960
Come to me, and every one does.
Come to me and bow his head.

214
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:17,970
Mark my words, my friends,
this lotion brings joy.

215
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:22,985
It cures thousands of ailments,
so why not give a try?

216
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:27,990
Don't fret, leave it to me..

217
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:32,995
If your head reels with pain
or your heart sinks in gloom.

218
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,005
Mr. Vijay, come here.

219
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:47,009
A great poet:
I was singing one of his poems.

220
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:53,015
Since I'm singing your song,
business has doubled.

221
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,017
Don't go.

222
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,017
I'll just finish him - What?

223
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:00,021
Stay put.

224
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:04,024
Mr. Vijay I'll give you a
special massage completely free.

225
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:11,033
No, thank you. The present
times have battered me enough.

226
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:17,039
It's amazing how you
still manage to smile.

227
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,042
Only a donkey in the noon sun..

228
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,045
..and a poet lost in
the poetry are so stunned.

229
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:27,049
True, only the glitter
of gold is like a sun.

230
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:30,052
So donkeys will.

231
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:33,052
What are you talking about?
- We're discussing donkeys.

232
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,091
Here I am.

233
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:15,097
Juhi, weren't you
waiting for me.

234
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:21,103
I'm waiting for a man in a car.
- In a car? Not a masseur.

235
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,108
May his tyres get punctured!

236
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:29,111
May your head get punctured!

237
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:35,117
Juhi, what happened?
Are you cross with me?

238
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:42,124
Have you no consideration
for the heart you have punctured.

239
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:46,128
Get it patched up.
- I have no wife to patch up.

240
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:49,131
What can I do about it?
- Marry me.

241
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,134
Stop it idiot!

242
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:56,138
Did you hear?
I have the gift of massaging.

243
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:00,142
If I had the gift if
cheating we could afford a car.

244
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,145
I'm done for!

245
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:08,150
A coconut? I get it.
I won't say another word.

246
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:23,166
Stop him I'll have
to chase him for a mile!

247
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,170
Stop! Naughty fellow.

248
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:29,170
Hello, Puspha

249
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:34,176
Vijay, I didn't recognize you.

250
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:39,181
You were so handsome.
Whose love brought you this?

251
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:43,185
Someone who won't
let me go. Unemployment.

252
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:49,191
Your children?
- And their father's.

253
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:53,195
They're Gullu and Fullu,
bright sparks like him.

254
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,197
What do you mean?

255
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:03,206
There's gathering at our old
college tonight, you must come.

256
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:11,213
Now I'll have to
him for a mile. I'll leave.

257
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:17,219
You must come tonight.

258
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,251
Where is Bhatacharya?
He was going to sing next.

259
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:02,264
Vijay, why hide out here?
Come inside.

260
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,268
No Puspha, my clothes..

261
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,271
You're decently covered
from head to foot.  Come along.

262
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,286
Ladies and gentlemen.

263
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:27,289
Bhatacharya isn't here.
We are delighted..

264
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:31,291
..we're delighted
that vijay is here.

265
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:35,295
..and I request him
to recite a poem.

266
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:39,301
Don't be formal.
Come along.

267
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:03,325
Let's hear you, Vijay.

268
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:18,341
I am weary of
this troubled life.

269
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:29,352
Weary of this
troubled existence.

270
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:35,357
I am grief, may I not
reject the entire world.

271
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:40,362
Why such a sad song on this
occasion? Recite a happy verse.

272
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:45,367
How can I sing of joy..

273
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:51,373
..if I live in pain.

274
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,380
I can only.

275
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:04,386
..return to life what
life itself offers to me

276
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:18,400
Once again..

277
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:23,405
.. the memories of love
stir in my heart.

278
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:29,411
I confess..

279
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:36,419
.. that I have been overcome
by my life's blows.

280
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:52,434
Today I break all belief.

281
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:04,446
..in the illusion of hope.

282
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:12,454
Today I vow..

283
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:17,459
..to voice no
complaint against anyone.

284
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,489
Are you an ex-student.

285
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,496
Have you a job?

286
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,500
No, I need one.

287
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,504
You recite very well.

288
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:10,512
Here's my card.
Come to my office tomorrow.

289
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:38,540
Yourself?
Here are my poems.

290
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:44,546
When did you study at college?
- From 48 to 52.

291
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,549
Shall I read the poems aloud?

292
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,559
I married in 1952.

293
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:01,563
Did you study science or arts?

294
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:06,568
Arts. May I recite the poems?

295
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:12,574
You're sure you left college
in 52, or was it before?

296
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:20,582
In 52. Mr. Ghosh, my poems?
- Will you work?

297
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:28,591
Service? I thought you
called me for publishing poems.

298
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:33,595
There's still plenty of
time to publish your poems.

299
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:36,598
I must get to know you better first.

300
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:40,603
About me? - Yes.

301
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:44,607
Mr.  Chatterjee,
he is your new assistant.

302
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:47,610
You can join from tomorrow.

303
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:26,769
If I were to give my
heart to you? To your eyes?

304
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:32,774
If I were to lock your heart
away by closing my eyes?

305
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:15,818
If I were to adorn you
hair with flowers of love.

306
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:21,824
If I were to shake the
flowers to the ground.

307
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:03,866
If I were to remember
you in my dreams.

308
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:10,873
If I were to give
you sleepless nights.

309
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:51,914
If I were to lay my
heart at your feet.

310
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:58,921
If I were to deny your
love and walk away.

311
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:55,036
How have you been?
- l' m alive.

312
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:03,044
I want to see you happy.

313
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:10,051
Don't worry.
I have learnt to be happy.

314
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:12,050
Has some girl taught you?

315
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,059
One girl was enough for me.

316
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:22,063
I don't want to suffer again.

317
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:26,067
You mean you have erased
your first love.

318
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:28,066
I should have.

319
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:38,079
I forgot: I was
really going up.

320
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:17,119
Closing times.
3 hours you've waited. For whom?

321
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:38,139
Does Mr. Vijay
come here often?

322
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:41,142
Yes, but not lately.
Any message for him.

323
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:56,157
So you find something to
say to the waiter. What about me?

324
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:05,166
Have you had time
to look at them?

325
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:09,170
Which papers?
- Vijay calls them his poetry.

326
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:13,174
I've read them,
they are fine.

327
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:17,178
Why not publish some?

328
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:22,183
Are you mad? You must know..

329
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:26,187
..we publish famous poets,
not thrash of novices.

330
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,190
Put in advertisement instead.

331
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:41,202
What do you want?

332
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:46,207
Sir, this thrash of novice..

333
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:48,206
..may I take it away?

334
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:50,211
Yes.

335
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:04,225
Are you free tomorrow evening?

336
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:10,231
Come and lend a hand at
a party in my house.

337
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:14,235
I'll be there.

338
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:29,250
It's no good
getting upset, Juhi.

339
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:33,254
Who will care
for you in your old age?

340
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:36,257
God willing.

341
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:39,257
Be careful, or a
nut will fall on you.

342
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:43,264
If you want security,
listen to me.

343
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:47,268
If I'll listen
to you, I'll starve.

344
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:52,273
You can hardly keep yourself,
how can you feed me, too?

345
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:59,280
My hunger will be satisfied
by seeing you in my house.

346
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:03,284
Really?

347
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:06,287
Abdul sattar,
do you love me so much?

348
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,292
Let's marry
- Stop it, idiot.

349
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:15,296
Do you hear? No, nothing.

350
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:21,302
No nut.

351
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:28,309
Your husband? - He's ill.

352
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:32,313
He wanted me to take him
to hospital, but I put it off.

353
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:35,316
How could I miss such a party?

354
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:37,315
You're very kind.

355
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:46,327
And the children.

356
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:55,336
How did you get my address?

357
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,340
Your address?
Do you live here?

358
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:03,344
Let's go outside.

359
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:06,347
Mr. Ghosh told me to come.

360
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:10,351
Told you? Do you know him?

361
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:13,354
I work for him.

362
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:17,358
And you? - I am his..

363
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:21,362
Who is the most
talented poet here?

364
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:23,361
They are all good.

365
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:26,367
But the one in
black jacket is..

366
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:37,378
Don't tell him
about us. Understand?

367
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:47,385
Poems that serve
the nation are better than..

368
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:50,391
.. Iove poems.

369
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:53,394
Gentlemen, drop this argument.

370
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:57,398
The drinks are here.

371
00:59:00,503 --> 00:59:02,403
Leave it to the servant, dear.

372
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:07,408
Come along, serve the drinks.

373
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:21,422
How could l..

374
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:27,428
.apprise her of my love.

375
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:31,432
The words froze on my lips.

376
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:35,436
Tears welled in my love.

377
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:38,439
In the gallantry
of frigid hearts.

378
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:43,444
Where pleasure is sought.

379
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:47,448
Clammy fingers cling
to the cup of whine.

380
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:51,452
I quaffed the wine,
a drop was spilled.

381
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:06,468
An extreme despair
came to my rescue.

382
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:12,473
Receiving my poet, out of pity,
she deigned to love me.

383
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:21,482
Who are the fortunate ones..

384
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:28,490
..who gain the love they seek.

385
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:36,497
Great Mr. Ghosh! Even your
servants recite poems.

386
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:43,504
I'll arrange for the dinner.
-  Can only rich be the poets?

387
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:47,508
Go ahead, young man.

388
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:10,521
When I ask for flowers,
I was given thorns.

389
01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:14,535
Who are the fortunate ones..

390
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:19,540
..who gain the love they seek?

391
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:33,554
When I searched
for the happiness..

392
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:38,559
..I was lost in the
streets of sadness.

393
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:57,579
When I sought songs of joy,
I heard songs of sorrow.

394
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:06,588
Every friend doubled
the pain of my heart.

395
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:17,599
When I ask for flowers,
I was given thorns.

396
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:22,603
Who are the fortunate ones..

397
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:26,607
..who got the love they sought.

398
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:40,621
Companions came..

399
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:54,636
Companions came, stayed a
while then left me all alone.

400
01:02:55,738 --> 01:03:04,646
Who had the time to spare to
clasp the hand of falling man?

401
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:13,655
Even my shadows elude me
as its fades away.

402
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:25,656
When I ask for flowers,
I was given thorns.

403
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:33,675
Who are the fortunate ones
who gain the love they seek?

404
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:52,683
If this is called living then
I'll live my life somehow.

405
01:04:02,805 --> 01:04:11,713
I shall not sigh, I shall seal
my lips, I shall dry my tears.

406
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:21,723
Why should I fear grief, when
I have encountered it so often?
