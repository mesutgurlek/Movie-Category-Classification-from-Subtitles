00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,144
In Vienna in 1844

2
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,747
nice people neither danced the waltz

3
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,850
nor kissed their wives

4
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,554
in public nor listened to new ideas

5
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,961
In 1845 came Johann Strauss II and

6
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,829
his immortal melodies

7
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,834
We've dramatized his spirit

8
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,699
rather than facts of his life

9
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,533
because it's his spirit that has lived
in his music

10

VIENNA KK COMMERCIAL BANK

11
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,824
Just a minute, my dear Mr. Strauss... 

12
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:17,229
and what's this?

13
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,399
A waltz

14
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,032
Another waltz, I see

15
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,775
Mr. Strauss, your father persuaded me

16
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,004
to take you in against my judgment

17
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,946
And what's my reward?

18
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,745
Every time I turn around,

19
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,808
there's another waltz printed on this paper

20
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:33,750
This is all... 

21
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:34,820
Don't... you don't

22
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:35,912
You know, those are mine

23
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,116
You've got me a 60,000 golden

24
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,750
And you've got my waltz

25
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:46,895
And now, get over then... you're fired

26
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,330
Join those revolutionaries... 

27
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,162
they won't go to work either

28
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,998
No fuss, no frank than serve in the street

29
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,044
to start another revolution

30
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,004
Now, Mr. Wertheimer... 

31
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,412
Get out

32
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,014
Thanks for firing me, Mr. Wertheimer

33
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,985
Goodbye, you worms

KK COMMERCIAL BANK

35
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:46,217
Bless you, son... 
Mr. Wertheimer closed today?

36
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,259
Well, perhaps they run out of money

37
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,761
One half of the bank is still open

38
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,298
The bank is still open... 
but we're not in it

39
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,827
A nice happy holiday, Johann?

40
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,300
Yes

41
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,529
Yes

42
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,629
Is... is Poldi around?

43
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,403
Ah, he wants to see Poldi... 
Mama, you hear?

44
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:07,004
Sure... I thought he maybe came to see you

45
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:10,880
If you please, Mr. Finance Minister

46
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,387
Look what the mailman brought you?

47
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,913
Johann... hello, Johann

48
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,153
Hello, Poldi, what... what are you doing?

49
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,457
What am I doing?

50
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,190
What are you doing here?

51
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,699
This is wonderful in the middle
of the day

52
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,496
How did you get away from the bank?

53
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,935
Well, l... I just walk out

54
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:36,174
Johann, something is the matter?

55
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,142
Is something happening?

56
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:41,112
Oh, nothing... nothing that
I don't want to happen

57
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,181
What's happening, Johann?

58
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,309
What's happening... ?

59
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,410
I've... I've been fired

60
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,953
That's what's happening

61
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,385
Oh, I'm sorry, Poldi

62
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,323
I didn't mean to yell at you

63
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,884
That's alright

64
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,453
Man has right to yell when
he has been fired

65
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:01,022
You always seem to know when
I'm in trouble, don't you?

66
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,933
Johann, shall I guess what are you
doing at the bank?

67
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,832
Alright, you guess I'm writing
waltz again

68
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,703
Oh, Johann, don't be rude... 

69
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,608
there're other banks in the world

70
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,876
Maybe Mr. Wertheimer is going
to give you another chance

71
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,347
But I don't want another chance

72
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,349
I'm glad he has fired me

73
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,248
Now I'm free

74
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,308
Who's free?

75
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:23,651
I am... free to do I've always wanted to... 

76
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,487
free to write music

77
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,751
I quit the bank

78
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,251
You quit the bank?

79
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,296
Hm

80
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,422
But your Papa wanted you to become a banker... 

81
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,965
to have a career

82
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,032
You call banking a career?

83
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,967
Do you know what career is?

84
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,062
Have you heard of Mozart, Schubert and
Beethoven?

85
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,834
They had what I call a career

86
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,239
Did they make money?

87
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,570
They made glorious music

88
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:46,771
Yes, Papa, that's right... 

89
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:47,835
they made glorious music

90
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,780
Yeah... I heard their music

91
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,516
Johann, if you want to write waltz... 

92
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:52,642
you write waltzes

93
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:53,776
And I play them... 

94
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,050
I play them the way
I always felt they should be played

95
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,784
I'll organize my own orchestra

96
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,285
But how?

97
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,753
You don't have a penny in your pocket

98
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,093
Oh... musicians don't play for nothing

99
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,860
Oh, they don't, do they?

100
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,526
Poldi darling, you don't know musicians

101
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,002
Well, I know 50 men who are willing to... 

102
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,971
now you just wait

103
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,040
Kienzl

104
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:16,666
Yes?

105
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,143
Kienzl, what do you love the most
in the world?

106
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,304
Huh?

107
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,079
Well, sometimes a girl... 
most times a goulash

108
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,709
No... you play violin... 

109
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:27,879
don't you love your violin?

110
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,582
Yes, but a good beef goulash with... 

111
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:33,090
Alright... would you like to play
in my orchestra?

112
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,421
When you have an orchestra?

113
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,758
If I have an orchestra, would you like
to play in it?

114
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,429
Well, if you had, you mean for nothing?

115
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,557
But of course for nothing

116
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:41,190
Is it permanent?

117
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:41,858
Sure

118
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,799
That's a nice one when you're taking... 

119
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,360
you should take it to the park

120
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,370
Yes, that's a good idea

121
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,406
Look, Kienzl... 

122
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:48,735
do you know Dudelman
who plays violin?

123
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:49,604
Hm

124
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,108
And Albert and Duffman?

125
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,370
Where we could get them?

126
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,310
We could get them easily... 

127
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,006
they jump at a chance like this

128
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,641
Is this the nice way to entertain
your sweetheart?

129
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,351
Sweetheart?

130
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,183
He doesn't know if I'm standing
on my head or feet

131
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,017
He's so mixed up with his troubles

132
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,149
And I don't blame him

133
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:11,056
Is this the way to look when a young
man comes to see you?

134
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,661
You know, Poldi

135
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,759
Sometimes it's good for a woman to make
a man think about something else

136
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,803
beside the troubles

137
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,567
How do you think I finally got
your Papa?

138
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,602
Keeping his mind on apple strudel

139
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,679
Now remember... be in my house
at 2 o'clock on Sunday

140
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:29,476
See, listen... 

141
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,039
I got a cousin who works
at the tea shop

142
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:31,742
What does he play?

143
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,786
A piccolo for nothing... 
I'd recommend him too

144
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,377
Bring him along

145
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:36,779
There you're, Poldi... 

146
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,551
there's true musician for you

147
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,320
Money doesn't mean a thing to him... 

148
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,849
he never even thought of it

149
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,759
Johann, whatever career you choose... 

150
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,627
profit will be the very highest

151
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:48,029
Poldi, you do believe in me, don't you?

152
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,426
You know I do

153
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,397
I could kiss you for that

154
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,433
Yes, Johann

155
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,197
Poldi, you know what?

156
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,206
What?

157
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,710
Popofinger... Hans Popofinger

158
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:00,507
He's out of the job and

159
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,480
he's the best double bassoon player
in old Vienna

160
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,881
Oh, Poldi... what'll I do without you?

161
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,443
I don't know what you're doing with me

162
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,959
Hey, Mr. Strauss... 

163
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,397
I have an aunt who plays harp

164
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:24,436
Bring her too

165
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,732
But she's 72 years old

166
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,569
Just put her on the wheelchair and
bring her along

167
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,771
CASINO DOMMAYER:

168
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,538
DEBUT OF JOHANN STRAUSS

169
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,442
AND HIS ORCHESTRA

170
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,549
Excellent

171
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,130
I hope that dropout bank's job is
still there

172
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,096
Shh... 

173
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,328
You have a wonderful son, Mrs. Strauss

174
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,063
I warned him

175
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,566
I'm sorry

176
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:11,700
So am I

177
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,678
But don't take it much too hard... 
young Strauss

178
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,408
You know Beethoven was not a success

179
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,507
either the first time he waved his baritone

180
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,711
But gentlemen, I thank you very much

181
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,380
There's some goulash in the kitchen
on your way out

182
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,359
Boys, open the windows and
start your cleaning

183
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,659
Ladies and gentlemen... 
the performance is over

184
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:37,994
I'm very sorry, but the Dommayer
is to close early tonight

185
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,731
But I just paid for ticket and
call for a concert

186
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,430
Let's have it

187
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,407
We'll be glad to refund the money... 

188
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,500
but you see the performance is over

189
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,475
But we don't want the money

190
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:48,012
We want the music and the performance
is not over

191
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,378
Just a minute, please... 

192
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:54,052
I'm Aucust Dommayer, owner of
Dommayer's Casino and

193
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,315
the performance is over

194
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,083
And I'm Fritz Cellist,

195
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,953
the first tenor
of the Imperial Opera and

196
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,050
the performance is not over

197
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,794
I don't care who you're... 
the performance is over

198
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,726
The performance is not over

199
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:16,070
The performance is not over

200
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,210
Hey, what are you doing there?

201
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,837
Leave the windows open

202
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:26,475
The whole neighborhood might as well
hear it for nothing

203
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,912
Do you have any special wish, Madam?

204
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,353
Anything

205
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,561
Now let's play... 
let's play <Artist's Life>

206
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,530
Now the goulash will be burnt

207
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,088
But it's Carla Donner

208
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,100
Who's she?

209
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,192
Carla Donner

210
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,294
Carla Donner... the famous opera singer

211
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,373
The coach is ready, Madam

212
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,744
Yes, thank you... what time is it?

213
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,218
About 9 o'clock

214
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,079
We must go

215
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:17,518
Bring him along to the Hall of the
Palace tonight

216
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:18,893
He might amuse us

217
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,431
Us?

218
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:34,338
What a stink she is

219
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,399
Guess most people will see us

220
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,596
No extra charge

221
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,640
For nothing they'll listen

222
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,606
Now the <Polka>, you worms

223
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:54,016
And play as you never play before
in your life

224
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,485
For Vienna

225
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,508
Each man must have a hobby... 

226
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,746
his own kind of hobby

227
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,717
I want beer and girls

228
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:33,053
I'm fond of girls and beer

229
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,584
But me, I like to stay up

230
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,652
and keep my spirit way up

231
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,697
In a girl I found... 

232
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:39,958
And songs that sound... 

233
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:44,265
Sound like anyone you hear

234
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,998
Every night in the beat... 

235
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:53,204
every beat and every hymn... 

236
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:38,910
What has happened?

237
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,878
Look, Strauss... 

238
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,086
I'm afraid I'm not very elegant
in these clothes

239
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:31,894
Don't worry

240
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:35,229
Thanks to Carla Donner... 
others are welcome to town for dinner

241
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,858
in any clothes

242
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,604
Look at our friend Hofbauer... 

243
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,400
why do you think he's here?

244
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,303
Hofbauer?

245
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,332
Do you think he's born in that
dressed shirt?

246
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,809
But he's the greatest music publisher
in Vienna

247
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,405
He's still Hofbauer

248
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:55,883
Where's Miss Donner?

249
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,012
I don't see her

250
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,750
She'll see you when she wants to

251
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,587
Fritz, I'm so glad you're here... 

252
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,183
take me to supper at once

253
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,889
May I present the young composer of
great talent... 

254
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,294
my friend Johann Strauss... 

255
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,593
Mr. And Mrs. Hofbauer

256
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,860
Oh, how do you do... ?

257
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,527
What nice eyes

258
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,968
Come along, Fritz... 
we'll know each other better

259
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,062
Young man, come along

260
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:20,040
Patrician, baritone and now
male's contralto

261
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,477
I'm honored, Mr. Hofbauer

262
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:22,775
Oh, Hofbauer... you know me?

263
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,840
I'm Hofbauer and you... your name?

264
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:26,406
Strauss

265
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,009
Struass... 

266
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,411
My wife is a lovely woman... 
a lovely woman

267
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:31,820
Are you a guest here... yes?

268
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:34,451
Madam Carla Donner was good enough
to invite me here tonight

269
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,049
Carla Donner?

270
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,321
Oh, you watch your step, young man

271
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,453
As far as Carla Donner is concerned... 

272
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,427
Yes?

273
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,762
Come home with the... well, you know

274
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,667
aware to the wife's suspicion... Who are you... ?

275
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:45,896
I'm a composer

276
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:46,835
Composer?

277
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,236
Who published you... Shayahara?

278
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,740
Oh, mark my word, young man

279
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,332
If it's not in the print by Hofbauer... 

280
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,604
it's not even music

281
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:53,906
Mister... 

282
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:54,843
Strauss

283
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,244
Strauss... I never heard of your music... 

284
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,077
never heard of it

285
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,776
You'll hear it perhaps tonight... 

286
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,442
from Madam Donner herself

287
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,486
if you have no objection

288
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,784
Oh, I have no objection at all, Mister... 

289
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,479
I don't care what your name is... 
I don't care

290
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,286
Smith... Rudolf Smith

291
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,554
Rudolf, goodnight... 

292
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,534
My dear young man, if you... 

293
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:24,900
well, it's the young man
from the casino, Mister... 

294
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,307
Strauss... Johann Strauss

295
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:30,109
Madam, I can't tell how... 
how grateful I'm

296
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:31,581
You're so kind to invite me tonight

297
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,015
Mr. Strauss... Prince Butarka

298
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,485
How do you do?

299
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:37,811
Mr. Strauss is

300
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,084
the most exciting player in Vienna

301
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:44,729
After I finish my little wine... 
will you please?

302
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,302
I'm sorry, Madam... 
I didn't mean to interrupt

303
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:52,997
You did me a favor

304
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,006
Now you can do me another favor

305
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,563
Anything, Madam

306
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,040
Will you please get out of my dress?

307
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,099
Get out?

308
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,702
Oh, I'm so sorry

309
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:06,115
I have no idea... I seem to be caught

310
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,745
So soon?

311
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,246
What... Madam?

312
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,214
I can simplify everything

313
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,217
But Madam, your gown, l... 

314
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,852
Now tell me... did he ask you to bring

315
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,055
along some of your music?

316
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:23,295
Yes, Madam, I have a piece here... 
pardon me

317
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,499
Oh, how nice

318
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,807
'Knowing you that you want me'

319
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,209
Did you write the lyrics yourself... 
Mr. Strauss?

320
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,874
Yes, Madam

321
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:41,214
A lovely idea... you know we're going
to explode a little bomb on ice

322
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,878
I'll sing it

323
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:45,512
But Madam that... this is a waltz

324
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:46,749
I know it

325
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,350
You think it's wise?

326
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,362
All these people, I mean your friends... 

327
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:54,559
maybe they won't think it proper

328
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,661
It's time to change their minds

329
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,259
Oh, I see you've already met

330
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,395
Yes, Mr. Strauss,

331
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,996
will you give this
to the leader of the band there?

332
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,166
Yes, Madam

333
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,199
Are you going to sing a waltz here?

334
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,269
I'm going to sing it, but first
you've to announce

335
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,176
Now... Carla?

336
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,079
Now, Fritz

337
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,218
A waltz... 

338
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,084
Ho... 

339
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,281
Where's Madam Donner?

340
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:19,755
Oh, she's down there with the musicians

341
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,123
What's the idea coming to us... 
even invited musicians?

342
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:25,295
Huh, they even invited music publishers

343
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:32,360
Ladies and gentlemen... I've been asked
to direct your attention here

344
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:36,703
Madam Carla Donner has graciously
consented to sing for us

345
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,011
We won't let them know it's waltz

346
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:46,947
When we go on to a quarter time,

347
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,977
we let some stalemate and
lift some eye brows

348
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,148
If they lift too far... 
you've to protect me

349
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,055
I can protect you from everything, but... 

350
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,752
But what... Madam?

351
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,622
Tonight I bring you a new song

352
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:01,188
from a new composer, Mr. Johann Strauss

353
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,797
and I hope his music will attract you

354
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:06,860
as it does me

355
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,462
He's impostor... an impostor

356
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,565
He tells me his name is Rudolf

357
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:18,279
Bravo... 

358
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:26,493
Bravo, Madam

359
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,366
Madam, I can't hardly speak

360
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,732
I don't think the song
will be sung again

361
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,930
It'll never be done so beautifully

362
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,074
Well, the piano alright?

363
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,166
I'm afraid it's tone a little bit hash

364
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,108
I've never heard of it, Madam... 
believe me

365
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,040
Then there's a new one here from Munich

366
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,605
Would you like to try it for me?

367
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,082
Of course, Madam

368
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,888
What a relief... 

369
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,221
I like quiet room, don't you?

370
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,594
Yes, Madam

371
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:03,093
Now let me see where's the... 

372
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,760
There's no piano... 

373
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:06,599
quiet rooms don't have pianos

374
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:09,429
But they have wine

375
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:14,371
Someone who was very thoughtful... 
wine makes up music

376
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,376
Thank you, Madam

377
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,745
Are you disappointed there's no piano?

378
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:20,584
No, Madam

379
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:24,883
Are you unappy... to be alone with me?

380
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,684
Oh, no, Madam... it's only that... 

381
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,749
that I can't hardly believe

382
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,420
all the other times aren't real

383
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:32,960
Other times?

384
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:38,665
I mean... at the opera when you're always
way down below on the stage

385
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,130
But when your voice came after me... 

386
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,336
you were wonderfully close... 

387
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,433
I mean... 

388
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:49,178
And we're alone together?

389
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:54,116
Last time you sang <Norma>... 

390
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:56,349
you're the only one there... 

391
00:30:56,454 --> 00:31:00,447
you and l... and the greatest voice
in the world

392
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:02,957
The only composer I ever knew

393
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,552
was fat little man with bald head

394
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,392
Well, I never know further I'll be any
kind of composer or not

395
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:15,670
All I know is when you first walked to
the Dommayer's at the night and

396
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:17,468
I played to you

397
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,305
You should know I played to you

398
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:23,212
And just now when... you sang my waltz
before everybody

399
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:26,182
I'm more alone with you than ever

400
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,311
More alone than now?

401
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,465
Sorry for being late, Carla... 

402
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:49,133
I've an order from His Majesty... 
he's troubled sometimes

403
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,274
Darling, you must be worn out

404
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,902
Tony, this is the lovely young man... 

405
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,309
he's a composer

406
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,180
He and I have been along together
for years, haven't we?

407
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:03,313
This is our host, Count Hohenfried... 
Mr. Strauss

408
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,655
He was up in the balcony and
I was on the stage

409
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:09,591
As a matter of fact, we're practically
sweet-hearted

410
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:12,095
Perfect, really?

411
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:14,528
I heard you sang a waltz too... 

412
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:18,494
another one of your Bohemian evening
... - my darling?

413
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:23,063
Tony... why?

414
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,176
I defense... I imagine

415
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,803
Thank you

416
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:36,015
The usual fee for musician I believe
is 10 golden

417
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,022
You can't insult my composer... 

418
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,886
his performance is brilliant

419
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,892
Very well, 50 golden

420
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:43,885
Oh, I'm ashamed of you... 

421
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,021
nothing less than 100 golden

422
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:47,895
Alright, my dear... 100 golden

423
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:49,490
That's more like it, honey

424
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:50,761
Thank you, Sir

425
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:53,030
But might need it for another necklace

426
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:55,772
As a matter of fact, I owe you 10 times as much

427
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,536
what I've learned here tonight

428
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,408
The performance is great, Madam... 

429
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:03,436
I hope you were amused

430
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,701
Poldi, what are you doing here?

431
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,331
Yes, well... I don't know

432
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,139
What do you mean 'you don't know'?

433
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,270
I'm so foolish

434
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:41,045
I'm so sorry... it's just silly

435
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,355
I got just a funny feeling

436
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,652
when you went away
with the gentleman in Dommayer's

437
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:50,820
And then suddenly I know, l... 

438
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:53,386
I thought you were in danger

439
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,159
I'm so silly

440
00:33:55,199 --> 00:34:00,034
Of course, here you're perfectly
a grown up man... perfectly alright

441
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,471
I could drop some puddles on the
sidewalk

442
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:10,003
Poldi, don't you dare drop puddles
on the sidewalk?

443
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,176
Johann

444
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,750
I'm a lucky fool, Poldi

445
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:19,017
I never knew I've had this much
in your heart

446
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,619
You always are

447
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,886
Don't forget to turn off the light

448
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:26,361
Oh, I was just about to arrest her, officer

449
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,761
Don't you see how guilty she looks?

450
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,167
I wish my wife looks guilty as that

451
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:39,971
Oh, Johann, now I really could drop
on the sidewalk

452
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:45,277
POLDI AND JOHANN

453
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,457
Now... sit down

454
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:04,558
Sit down, everybody

455
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:08,071
Now comes the speech

456
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,303
Fine, yeah... who can talk without wine?

457
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,773
Well, who can talk without cake?

458
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,638
Thank you, Madam... 
I just take a little piece

459
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:19,410
Oh

460
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,957
My friends, I should like to propose
a toss

461
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,689
I'll make it short, my friend

462
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,991
Kienzl is about to eat the cake

463
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:39,994
As for Johanrs happiness, that now has
beautifully and for all times

464
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,971
in Poldi's care

465
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,574
I had met 100 of young men,

466
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,510
but never had I met finnier young man and

467
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:52,310
finnier musician than Johann Strauss

468
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,884
Oh, that's lovely... so sweet

469
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,044
Johann... speech

470
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,611
Yes... come on

471
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,215
Go on... say something

472
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:04,022
That's there... say just a few words

473
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,632
My darling wife... 

474
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,463
My dear mother... 

475
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:13,502
My new Mama and Papa... 

476
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:16,165
My dear colleagues... 

477
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,864
Yesterday Kienzl was a baker and

478
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,170
the baker is a colleague today

479
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,939
Yes, and tomorrow who knows... 

480
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,502
maybe a baron or a king?

481
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,478
Don't laugh... 

482
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,711
Revolution is not so far away... 
my friends

483
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,685
All he thinks is about being a baron

484
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:32,245
He forgets what we're fighting for is
constitution... 

485
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,225
representation... free press and free speech... 

486
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:38,023
Sit down... go on, Johann

487
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,728
Tonight I find even more than happiness

488
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,992
and more than our success together

489
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:47,231
And believe me,
you can't find it in the rich palaces

490
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:50,240
You can't find it in hard cover the
gold bracelets or... 

491
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:53,573
behind the falls of painted laughter

492
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:58,512
You can't find peace in the deep quiet
breath of living there

493
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,744
because that I know... 

494
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:03,286
I know because I've found it here tonight

495
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:06,983
in my wife... in my music

496
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,319
and in my friends... 

497
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,726
Bravo... wonderful

498
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,058
Excellent... 

499
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,156
I mean perfect... I mean bravo... 

500
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,132
Bravo

501
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,202
Yes, thank you

502
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:21,238
Mr. Hofbauer... the music publisher

503
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:22,067
Mr. Hofbauer?

504
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:22,867
Yeah

505
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,599
Good evening, Sir

506
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,233
They told me I could find you here

507
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,503
They told me you just got married

508
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,271
Yes, Sir

509
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:28,505
Well, don't worry

510
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,343
We're once in a while... we're both
in the same goal together

511
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,043
I mean we're in the same boat together... 
same boat together

512
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:34,846
This is my wife

513
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:36,180
Oh, how do you do... ?

514
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,552
You know your waltz has created
quite a big splash

515
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,250
Well, it's not so big splash... 

516
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:41,586
it's just a mild splash

517
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:42,751
I had a few offers

518
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,851
By the way, I have a contract here
for you to sign... 

519
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,157
sort of a wedding present

520
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,458
Johann... a contract?

521
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:48,896
Do you have quill pen?

522
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:49,523
Yeah, I'll get it

523
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,568
That's 1,000 golden for a year
for your waltz

524
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,126
1,000 golden a year?

525
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:56,105
Oh, Johann... who said you can't earn
money writing a waltz?

526
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,266
I always believe in being generous to
young composers

527
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,776
Here, just sign here... sign here

528
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,209
I'm sorry, Mr. Hofbauer... 

529
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,746
but this is not enough

530
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,069
Not enough?

531
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:05,342
Are you joking?

532
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:06,407
Here go on... sign

533
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:07,609
No... 

534
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,244
I mean it... the golden is down

535
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,480
We're headed for an inflation... 

536
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:13,182
the discount rate might go to 20%

537
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:14,918
Oh, no, not 1,000 golden a year... 

538
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,290
but 1,000 golden for each waltz

539
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,088
I write in a year

540
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:17,992
What?

541
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,326
You must be mad... you must be crazy

542
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,399
Call me somebody... he has a fever

543
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,832
You know I must spend money
for exploitation... 

544
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,600
exploitation

545
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:29,400
It's 1,000 golden for each waltz
or nothing

546
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,665
Oh... 1,000 golden

547
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,075
Well, say we're... compromise

548
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,841
I'll give you 500 golden... 500

549
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,405
1,000 golden

550
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,475
Well, 750 golden

551
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:43,485
1,000 golden

552
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:45,179
1,000 golden?

553
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,991
Alright... 

554
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,355
Here... 
I don't expect you to write a waltz

555
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:55,989
or 2 in a year, don't we?

556
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,863
Here are 6 to start with

557
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:00,699
Oh... 6,000 golden

558
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,361
He's a music rapid for

559
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,907
you were no Mr. Hofbauer

560
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,002
Fine piece of appreciation... 

561
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,409
Everybody should be proud love to sing
Hofbauer publication,

562
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,437
even Carla Donner Carla Donner?

563
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,640
I don't care who sings them... 

564
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,343
Vienna will sing them

565
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:55,352

A Waltz by Johann Strauss

574
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,440
Vienna loved Strauss waltzes

575
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,239
and listened to new ideas

576
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:17,075
It clamored for the right of man
to govern himself

577
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:19,912
and so one day Strauss wrote a march

578
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,742
DOWN WITH TYRANNY

GIVE ARMS TO THE STUDENTS

580
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:39,093
Hey... it's Johann

581
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:55,852
It's the Palace of Hobenfried

582
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,852
Whose palace?

583
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:57,785
Hobenfried

584
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:00,653
I know that place... let's charge

585
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:07,728
Wait

586
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,829
Well, it's my fiddle player

587
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,403
Are you going to walk out
during the game again, Mr. Strauss?

588
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,201
Take her away

589
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,470
Now, wait a minute... she's not an enemy

590
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:19,804
She's a singer... she's an artist... 

591
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,003
just like ourselves

592
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:23,740
She's one of us... that's why she's here

593
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,443
She's our Goddess of Liberty

594
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,514
Just a minute, gentlemen... 
I'm a singer, yes

595
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,785
But a goddess... damn that

596
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,120
You should stick to your music... 
Mr. Strauss

597
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:58,511
Carla... 

598
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,107
I'll take care of her

599
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,878
Carla

600
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,942
Now stop shouting, you fool... 

601
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,044
it's trouble enough there

602
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,679
I'm not afraid of the rebels... 
I'm not one of them

603
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:06,620
If they find out she's your friend... 

604
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:07,713
they'll tear her to pieces

605
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,224
I suppose she's sick of with the
common fiddlers

606
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,251
Yes, you're kind of responsible
for all this

607
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:12,090
You mean you aren't?

608
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:12,958
If I have my saber... 

609
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,122
Well, you haven't got any

610
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:14,822
Now you listen to me

611
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,129
She was about to be mobbed in the
carriage when I came in a nick of time

612
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:17,962
Open the door, Hobenfried

613
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,399
Oh, no... you don't

614
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:22,371
Just a moment... release him, who are you?

615
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:23,667
My name is Strauss, Johan Strauss... 

616
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:25,106
not your humble servant either

617
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:27,268
Now if you want some good advice... 
don't poke your nose out that way

618
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:28,278
The mad musician, Sir

619
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:32,111
Oh, I see... an artist, a musician

620
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:34,548
And just what's your part in the
revolution, Mr. Strauss?

621
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:36,752
I wrote the song <We March To>

622
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:40,051
See, and just why are you rebelling... 
Mr. Strauss?

623
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:41,682
Why... ?

624
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,886
Because... 'tyranny oppressior has been

625
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:45,154
written in the banners there... 

626
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:45,957
can't you read?

627
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:48,055
And how are you oppressed, Mr. Strauss?

628
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:49,156
Oh, never mind that

629
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,393
Now if you know what's good for you... 

630
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:51,560
you'll sneak out the back way

631
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:52,533
You're impertinent, Sir

632
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:55,800
And you're a stuffed shirt and
your face annoys me

633
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:57,230
Yes, Captain?

634
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,502
The situation is under control now... 

635
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:00,076
all the rioters have been arrested

636
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,236
And arrest this man too

637
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,746
I'll see you again some time

638
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,540
I ask profound apology in my house... 
Your Highness... 

639
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:10,246
The incident doesn't occur, Hobenfried

640
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:11,549
Thank you, Sir

641
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,385
And now, we must go immediately

642
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,584
With your permission, Your Highness... I must... 

643
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:16,923
there's someone in distress

644
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:19,589
I'm sorry, Hobenfried, there's empire
in distress

645
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,201
I'm just trying to tell you that
she has nothing to do with this

646
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:28,897
Shut up... come on here

647
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:29,803
You idiot... 

648
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,138
I happen to be Madam Carla Donner
of the Opera

649
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:33,608
Yes... I know

650
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:36,908
Goldilocks... you're Goddess of Liberty

651
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:40,983
Go ahead

652
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:57,300
The farmers must be very happy

653
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:08,241
Halt... remove the barricade... 

654
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:16,150
Dudelman... Kienzl, Dudelman

655
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,744
Johann

656
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,534
Kienzl, what's on your mind?

657
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,744
Kienzl, for the last time... 
what's on your mind?

658
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:56,319
For you, Kienzl

659
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,238
Hurry up... come with me

660
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:10,705
Which way did they go?

661
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,675
Down the street, get them back... come on

662
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:14,074
After them

663
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:22,441
I can't go like this... where can we go?

664
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,853
Come with me

665
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:29,881
My shoe

666
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,427
Your what?

667
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,061
You, oh... I'm afraid it's not safe here

668
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,034
No place is safe with you... 

669
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:45,574
I want to go home

670
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:46,472
Where do you live?

671
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:47,669
I won't tell you

672
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,178
I'm not taking any more chances

673
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:51,474
Alright... you stay here

674
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,539
I won't stay here... give me my shoe

675
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:54,140
Your what?

676
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:55,480
Yes

677
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:59,317
Madam, if ever there's a man regretted
his kindness,

678
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:00,720
I'm that man

679
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:03,385
You... kind... ?

680
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,291
Coachman

681
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:17,938
Have you 2 heard there'll be
a revolution?

682
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:21,374
Maybe... Harrison Street, No.8

683
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,346
I bet you haven't heard... 
it had been barricaded

684
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:27,411
Well, l... can you reach Yusa Estate Casa?

685
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:30,112
How long have you 2 been here?

686
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:31,781
It's barricaded too

687
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:35,420
Is there any place in Vienna you can go
except around this block?

688
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:37,625
Well, yes... 

689
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:39,821
There're always the Vienna Woods... 

690
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,660
a lovely ride

691
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,465
Now, will you decide, Madam?

692
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:45,934
Frankly, I don't care

693
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:48,528
I don't care where I'm and where I go

694
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:50,436
or whether the sun will rise again

695
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:54,534
or whether I'll live or die... 
I just don't care

696
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:57,443
The Vienna Woods

697
00:46:57,514 --> 00:47:02,042
The Vienna Woods... get up, Rosy

698
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:43,951
What time is it?

699
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:44,857
Where am I?

700
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,930
Good morning

701
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,801
If you knew how pretty picture you've made... 

702
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,835
2 little babes in the woods

703
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:56,963
sleeping in each other's arms

704
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,565
Where are we?

705
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:01,440
Where you want to be... in Vienna Woods

706
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:04,071
And it's only 6 o'clock in the morning

707
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:07,674
and you still have a long and
beautiful day ahead of you

708
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:10,385
You haven't helped me

709
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,919
Amen

710
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:42,696
Come on... my Rosy

711
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:52,928
GRINZING GARTEN RESTAURANT

712
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:01,934
You won't believe it, but we composed
the whole thing in one day

713
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:04,307
with only 20 minutes over lunch

714
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:05,814
What do you mean 'we'?

715
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:07,042
I mean 'we'... 

716
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:11,383
Mr. And Mrs. Strauss, me and Rosy

717
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:15,088
Alright... I'll keep an ear open
for sour notes

718
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:18,286
If there's any sour note and it's the flaw,

719
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,261
I beg you to leave it out

720
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:24,995
Such a time for revolution... just when
Johann Strauss himself

721
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:27,332
drops out of a clear sky and leave

722
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:29,928
my own restaurant on Sunday for nothing

723
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:30,837
Yes, right... 

724
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:34,206
these Viennese are coming
to a revolution on Sunday

725
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:36,712
Such a thing won't happen in my time

726
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,405
Quick, Cafniya... 

727
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,914
go see the lady
left her hat on the carriage

728
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:41,841
Maybe this is it?

729
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:47,323
Come to see it's... here it's

730
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:48,453
Thank you

731
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,220
What a beautiful hat, Mrs. Strauss

732
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:52,688
What did you say?

733
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:54,662
I said it's a beautiful hat

734
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:55,696
Oh, yes

735
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,060
Oh, please... let me do that

736
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:00,065
Excuse me, Mrs. Strauss... 

737
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:01,637
but I know these artists

738
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:03,570
I've been there to one for 30 years

739
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,937
Cafniya used to play the accordion

740
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,736
till the children broke it

741
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:08,743
Does your husband have a temper too?

742
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:09,801
Terrible

743
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,143
But I guess it's won'th it

744
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:15,310
It must be wonderful to be the wife

745
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:18,286
of a man like Johann Strauss

746
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,122
Yes, it must be wonderful

747
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:24,922
Oh, it's so beautiful, Mrs. Strauss... 

748
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:26,655
what's the name of it?

749
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:27,924
What?

750
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:33,401
Oh, it's called... it's called
<The Tale Of The Vienna Woods>

751
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:35,504
Oh... 

752
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:32,723
I thought of you ever since that night

753
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:36,595
And you walked away, proud and angry

754
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:40,996
Carla... I'm married

755
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:47,006
Oh... but you're here now
with your arms around me

756
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:48,509
Carla, we must face this

757
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:50,603
No... don't you see?

758
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,272
It was meant to be like this

759
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:54,612
Everything had brought us together... 

760
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:56,982
the night... the woods and the music... 

761
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:59,782
It had been so sweet and so dangerous

762
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:03,490
The revolution... the revolution is over

763
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:04,856
We've got a new Emperor... 

764
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:08,727
Duke Franz Joseph
a young wonderful Emperor

765
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:10,698
and a new Constitution

766
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:12,632
Look at them

767
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:18,302
Kienzl, Dudelman... how did you get here?

768
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:20,808
We've been released... 
everybody is released

769
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:23,845
Did you have... a pleasant escape?

770
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:25,608
We have a charming escape... 

771
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:26,740
thank both of you gentlemen

772
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:27,544
You're welcome, Madam

773
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:28,311
Now that you're free

774
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:29,214
You can play for us, Johann, can't you?

775
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:29,910
Oh, no... Kienzl

776
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:33,114
Yes... hey... listen everybody

777
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,521
This is our Strauss... our leader

778
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:37,388
He's going to lead our march

779
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,484
Will you forgive me, Carla?

780
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:39,653
Sure

781
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:46,499
Madam Donner?

782
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:48,002
Yes, what's it?

783
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:49,663
Count Hobenfried is outside, Madam

784
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:51,331
He has been searching everywhere
for you

785
01:01:51,674 --> 01:01:53,403
I'll tell him you're here

786
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:57,971
Wait... take me to him

787
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,418
Carla, I've been so anxious

788
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:11,887
Tony... you're always so kind to me

789
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:16,422
I'm sorry... I'm not going back to Vienna
with you

790
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:18,524
Why not?

791
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:22,137
I can't leave here now

792
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:25,129
Strauss is there?

793
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:26,673
Yes... 

794
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:32,781
This is not like you, Tony

795
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:41,251
I'll run back with you... shall we go?

796
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:46,392
The palace

797
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:48,396
To my house

798
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:57,061
Long live the Emperor

799
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:03,371
Kienzl... will that be the new Emperor?

800
01:03:03,412 --> 01:03:05,778
Yes... have a new wonderful face

801
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:09,306
Well, I didn't think so yesterday and
I told him so

802
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,818
You do what?

803
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:25,830
Ah, Mrs. Strauss... is Johann here?

804
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:26,926
Did he get my message?

805
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:29,494
Oh, he must be full of marches
after the revolution like this

806
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:30,470
I'll tell him you're here

807
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:31,131
Oh, I thank you

808
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:31,730
Alright... boy, let's go

809
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,106
Good morning, Mrs. Strauss... good morning

810
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,075
Come on, Kienzl

811
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:38,774
Mr. Kienzl, please... I've been promoted

812
01:03:56,299 --> 01:04:01,100
'You told me you loved me
when we were young one day'

813
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:04,436
Remember when you told me, Johann?

814
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:07,636
That's the most beautiful day
of my life

815
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,935
Please, Poldi... I'm very busy now

816
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:13,542
Johann, you must take time
for your coffee

817
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:14,947
Alright

818
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,155
'You told me you loved me'

819
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:23,218
What makes you think of it now, Johann?

820
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:24,850
Poldi, can't you see I'm working?

821
01:04:24,927 --> 01:04:26,690
Why ask a silly question like that?

822
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:29,029
I write a song as it comes to me... 

823
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:31,397
out of... out of my inspiration... 

824
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:34,231
out of everything... 
out of heaven knows what

825
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:38,467
I guess so, Johann... 
drink your coffee before it's cold

826
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:44,740
Cold?

827
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:46,109
It's scolding

828
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,012
I'll cool it for you

829
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:52,053
Johann, don't you think you should
lie down a while?

830
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:54,817
You must be tired after being
out of night

831
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,791
What are you driving at?

832
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:58,518
Can't you see I'm working?

833
01:04:58,594 --> 01:04:59,424
Why should I be tired?

834
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:01,190
I worked before, didn't I?

835
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:04,657
Oh, Johann... I won't disturb you anymore

836
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:05,994
Now you're hurt

837
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:07,429
No, I'm not hurt

838
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:08,628
You are

839
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:15,073
No, it's only... Johann, you're so crossed

840
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:16,735
since you come home

841
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:18,370
You didn't... 

842
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:21,610
I don't expect you to kiss me
if you don't feel like it

843
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:24,713
But you didn't talk to me

844
01:05:24,787 --> 01:05:27,779
Johann, what's the matter with you?

845
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:30,154
You're imagining things, that's all

846
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:31,716
I think it's you ought to lie down... 

847
01:05:31,794 --> 01:05:33,489
you're pale and tired

848
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:36,894
You know I can't sleep when
you're not at home

849
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:38,558
Now, that has got to stop

850
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:40,295
Why can't you sleep when I'm not home?

851
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:44,829
It's only natural for a wife who
can't sleep when her husband is out... 

852
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:47,068
in danger maybe

853
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,245
Why do I talk about things like that?

854
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:52,440
You're not going to stay out anymore

855
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:55,609
We don't have revolution everyday... 
thanks heaven

856
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:57,585
What does revolution have to do
with it?

857
01:05:57,653 --> 01:05:58,881
The revolution is the only thing that

858
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,582
can keep a man out once in a while?

859
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:01,645
Things happen to a man

860
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:04,158
Things... you can't foresee anything

861
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:05,989
Besides, I'm not your slave... 
not your prisoner... 

862
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:07,790
and we're not chained to each other

863
01:06:07,863 --> 01:06:09,990
Don't shout at me, please

864
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:13,331
If you've something on your mind... 
if you've something want to tell me... 

865
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:14,801
tell me

866
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:16,997
But don't shout at me

867
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:18,870
If you don't want to tell me,

868
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:21,102
you don't need to make excuses for yourself

869
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:23,304
You don't need to act like this

870
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:28,579
If you want to stay out at night... 
you're free to do so

871
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:32,985
But you must leave me free to worry
about you if I like

872
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:35,785
You must respect my feelings

873
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:39,951
To be the wife of Johann Strauss
is not a little thing

874
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:42,724
I've tried to be won'thy of it

875
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:45,027
I'm very proud of it

876
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:48,036
I won't let anyone shout at me

877
01:06:48,104 --> 01:06:50,664
for your sake as well as mine

878
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:57,309
Forgiver me, Poldi

879
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:59,847
I always seem to be shouting at you

880
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:02,741
I don't know what's the matter with me

881
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:06,953
I wouldn't change you... nothing on you... 

882
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:10,253
not even your moods... your temper

883
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:13,456
because I know you must be like this

884
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:15,621
to be you

885
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:18,259
Alright then, let's go away

886
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:21,098
It'll be better... better for both of us

887
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,934
Let's forget we ever saw Vienna

888
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,207
Forget Vienna?

889
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:31,245
L... I mean... there're too many
distractions here

890
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:34,305
But we live here, Johann

891
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:38,615
We live in a lovely new home and
all our friends

892
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:39,949
Don't you want to travel?

893
01:07:40,022 --> 01:07:41,853
Don't you want to see the world?

894
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:43,083
Of course, I do

895
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:44,820
If you... so... 

896
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:46,555
Alright then, darling... that's settled

897
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:49,757
Now you start packing your things and
I'll make the arrangements

898
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:52,390
We can't just pack up and go

899
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:54,868
We have a lot of things to attend to

900
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,132
No, nonsense

901
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:57,638
Then we go without attending to them

902
01:07:57,706 --> 01:07:59,196
Poldi, when you think of going... 

903
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:00,367
that's the time to go

904
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:03,810
But Mr. Hofbauer downstairs and boys... 

905
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:07,206
Oh, they are... fine

906
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:08,580
Come on... let's go

907
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:10,710
I'll tell them we're going right away

908
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:30,996
Ah... Strauss

909
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:35,710
Kienzl, will you stop that for a minute?

910
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,177
You wrote it

911
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:39,842
Alright... I'm sorry

912
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:43,643
Well, Poldi has something say to you

913
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:44,276
Huh?

914
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:46,480
Go on, Poldi... tell them the good news

915
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:47,749
Good news?

916
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:49,017
Right

917
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,453
We're going to leave Vienna

918
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:53,324
What?

919
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:54,054
Immediately

920
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:54,993
What for?

921
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:55,621
What's happening?

922
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:56,289
Why are you leaving?

923
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:58,128
Why he can't leave Vienna
if he wants to?

924
01:08:58,167 --> 01:08:59,225
Vienna is not the world

925
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:00,962
and he doesn't owe Vienna anything

926
01:09:01,036 --> 01:09:03,197
Vienna owes him more than
it can ever pay

927
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:04,171
What becomes of me... ?

928
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:05,400
Why the fuss?

929
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,066
Why are you all upset about?

930
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,838
The musician ought to travel

931
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:11,038
Poldi and I have made up our minds

932
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:13,240
It's all as well... we'll be back someday

933
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:16,807
Yes, we've planned it, that's all

934
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:21,886
After all, we never had our
real honeymoon

935
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:27,857
By the way, did you get my march?

936
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:28,555
No

937
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:29,154
What do you mean?

938
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:30,163
Didrt you get my message?

939
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:31,097
I haven't got a march

940
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:31,826
What have you got?

941
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:32,526
Nothing

942
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:33,193
Nothing?

943
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:36,237
Yes... there's a new piece you've composed

944
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:39,239
Yes, Poldi, it... but it's not ready yet

945
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:40,138
Look here, Strauss

946
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:41,608
Has Shanon made you some offer?

947
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:42,804
Remember you have a contract with me

948
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:43,777
for everything you write

949
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:46,212
Mr. Hofbauer, you know he won't do
a thing like that

950
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:48,546
If he doesn't want to play... 
you mustrt urge him

951
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:50,347
I never urged him... 
just temperamental, that's all

952
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:52,286
He wants to be temperamental... 
but he took my 1,000 golden... 

953
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:58,122
For every golden... alright, I'll get it

954
01:09:58,227 --> 01:10:03,028
Johann, you have it in your pocket... here

955
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:08,568
Yes... go ahead, Kienzl

956
01:10:08,637 --> 01:10:10,696
Sure... let's start

957
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:11,705
Alright... let's take places

958
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:13,036
Come on... sit down, boys

959
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:14,268
Come on, don't keep waiting
while you listen

960
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:15,002
He keeps waiting

961
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:15,906
You keep waiting

962
01:10:15,978 --> 01:10:16,672
All I have to do is waiting

963
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:18,679
You don't have to wait, Mr. Hofbauer

964
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:19,840
Vienna is a free city, you know

965
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:20,813
Oh, I see

966
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,214
The whole world is waiting
for this waltz

967
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:23,444
Why shouldn't you wait?

968
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:26,045
Yes, you should... that's right

969
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,134
Bravo... 

970
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:53,937
Carla

971
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:55,909
Madam Donner

972
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,969
How do you do, Madam?

973
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:00,714
It was beautiful, Mr. Strauss

974
01:12:01,383 --> 01:12:02,873
Thank you, Madam

975
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:04,646
I have great news

976
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,746
You've been commissioned to try another
opera in the Imperial Theatre

977
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:08,915
for me to sing

978
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:11,289
Oh, wonderful

979
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,759
Madam, you're incomparable

980
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:16,628
Cheer, everybody

981
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:18,960
Well, Johann, aren't you pleased?

982
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:21,665
Yes, of course, Madam... of course

983
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:23,329
Madam, will you permit me?

984
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:26,239
Poldi, this is my wife

985
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:29,734
I'm very glad to know you, Mrs. Strauss

986
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:32,007
I've been very anxious to meet you

987
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:33,912
This is an honor, Madam... 

988
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:36,473
thank you, you're very kind

989
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:40,079
I'm very grateful, Madam, but... 
I can't accept

990
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:43,323
We've made our plans... 
we're leaving Vienna

991
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:43,881
What's the matter, Strauss?

992
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:44,721
Are you insane?

993
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:47,284
Johann... for all our sake

994
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:49,761
You must persuade him, Mrs. Strauss

995
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,992
This is no time for pride, isn't it?

996
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:54,727
You're right, Madam... 

997
01:12:54,837 --> 01:12:56,737
this is no time for pride

998
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:00,836
You must stay, Johann

999
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:05,869
You mustrt miss an opportunity
like this... without considering

1000
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:08,746
To write an opera for the Imperial Theatre,

1001
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:12,753
this is what we... what you wanted all the time... 

1002
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:14,721
what you've dreamed for

1003
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:21,352
A NEW OPERA

1004
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:52,686
Shall I put this away, Mrs. Strauss?

1005
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:56,520
Poldi darling, maybe you'll change
your mind

1006
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:02,320
No, Mama... out the dress away, Anna

1007
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:08,666
I don't want to nag you, Poldi

1008
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:10,534
But after all, you really belong there

1009
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:11,766
What will people think?

1010
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:15,265
Mother, please... I'm too excited

1011
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,971
I'm so happy here with you and

1012
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:20,845
we can pray for him with all my heart and thoughts

1013
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:24,781
After the performance, we can celebrate

1014
01:15:28,223 --> 01:15:31,283
I believe that carriage is stopping
in front of our house

1015
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:35,225
Yes, it is

1016
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,325
Johann has sent for me

1017
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:43,565
Be careful... be careful of the stairs... 
Poldi

1018
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:51,370
I'll open the door, Anna

1019
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:55,245
Is Mrs. Strauss in?

1020
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:57,446
I'm Mrs. Strauss

1021
01:15:57,853 --> 01:15:59,844
I'm Count Hobenfried

1022
01:15:59,955 --> 01:16:01,547
My husband isn't here

1023
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:05,525
I know... 
could I speak to you for a moment?

1024
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:07,260
Come in, Sir

1025
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:08,996
Thank you

1026
01:16:14,469 --> 01:16:16,437
I shouldn't detain you for long, Madam

1027
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:18,369
Thank you, no... 

1028
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:23,171
Perhaps something what I've to say
is known to you

1029
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:30,678
l... Madam, I'm in love with Carla Donner

1030
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:35,622
What's that you want to speak to me
about, Count Hobenfried?

1031
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,893
Madam, for some time now,

1032
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:43,955
Madam Carla and your husband had... 
had been infatuated with each other

1033
01:16:44,499 --> 01:16:46,729
During all these weeks of rehearsals... 

1034
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:49,293
they've been together constantly and... 

1035
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:52,204
I don't understand one word
you're saying

1036
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,765
You don't know what all Vienna is... 

1037
01:16:57,879 --> 01:17:00,006
forgive me, Madam

1038
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:02,846
I understand what you feel... 
Count Hobenfried

1039
01:17:02,918 --> 01:17:03,885
But you're mistaken

1040
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:05,817
There's nothing wrong, I swear

1041
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:09,220
I give you my word

1042
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:14,922
You know, of course... 
there's always this rumor

1043
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:19,861
Madam, for your sake,

1044
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:22,062
I'd not presume for the sake of mine

1045
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:25,435
But for his sake, you should stop this
at once

1046
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,940
I've no right in this matter, Madam

1047
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:30,604
You're his wife... you have

1048
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:31,771
She'll destroy him

1049
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:33,337
They'll destroy each other

1050
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:36,350
She's the woman of violent feelings... 
strange whims

1051
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:38,511
and irresistible impulses

1052
01:17:38,553 --> 01:17:39,645
Mr. Strauss is not for the man

1053
01:17:39,721 --> 01:17:41,450
to cope with this extraordinary person

1054
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:42,217
He'll be ruined

1055
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:43,313
I beg you

1056
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:48,625
Madam, you must face the facts
unless you're willing to surrender

1057
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:51,998
What I can see is so dear to you

1058
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:58,132
You compelled me and controlled me to
say what I don't intend to say to anyone

1059
01:17:58,707 --> 01:18:00,937
You had told me nothing
that is not known to me

1060
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:03,637
that isn't known to me for some time

1061
01:18:03,745 --> 01:18:10,981
I lived all these weeks for... 
the knife in my heart

1062
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:15,818
I'm content to live here for his sake

1063
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:18,620
It's the better way it must be

1064
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:22,888
I'm sure there was anything to be done
he'd have done it

1065
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:26,832
I'm sure he suffers as much as I do

1066
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:29,631
Mrs. Strauss, Madam Donner leaves

1067
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,003
after the opera tonight for tour of Europe

1068
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,133
The situation between them... 

1069
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:36,541
I advise you to act quickly

1070
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:37,908
What'd you have me do?

1071
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:39,311
Fight

1072
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:42,116
What everyone wants to live in this
world, he has to fight for... 

1073
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:44,276
like the beast of jungle

1074
01:18:44,352 --> 01:18:47,082
This crisis arrives between people
even carefree,

1075
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:48,247
but profoundly

1076
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:51,086
If you want to keep him... 
if you want to save him... 

1077
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:53,093
don't leave it in his hands

1078
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:54,787
You must fight

1079
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:58,230
I thought my love fought for me

1080
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:03,234
I thought he needed me and
that was enough

1081
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:04,237
It's not enough

1082
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:04,965
You'll lose... 

1083
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:10,875
Don't say anymore, Count Hobenfried

1084
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:15,381
Will you excuse me?

1085
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:19,516
All this humiliation... 

1086
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:28,257
You never humiliated yourself... 
Count Hobenfried

1087
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:35,699
I've the greatest respect... the greatest

1088
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:07,124
Who was it, Poldi?

1089
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,273
Poldi, what's the matter with you?

1090
01:20:12,374 --> 01:20:13,773
Who was it?

1091
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:18,579
Why don't you say something?

1092
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:21,739
What time is it, mother?

1093
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:25,979
It's quarter to 10

1094
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:27,884
Poldi, what happened?

1095
01:20:28,123 --> 01:20:30,216
What's the matter with you?

1096
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:31,892
First I dress up

1097
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:34,622
Do you think I could get there in time
for the finale?

1098
01:20:34,696 --> 01:20:36,391
But if you hurry, you might

1099
01:20:36,464 --> 01:20:38,125
But what come over you?

1100
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:40,861
Now suddenly you make up your mind

1101
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:42,833
You're quite right, mother

1102
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:46,374
I'm going, of course... I'm going

1103
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:49,434
I have to go

1104
01:20:49,811 --> 01:20:53,008
Johann offered me not have to go
before, was it?

1105
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:56,777
Ha... why those people do
such a crazy thing?

1106
01:20:57,252 --> 01:20:58,879
You'd better lie down, Poldi

1107
01:20:58,987 --> 01:21:01,217
Lie down?

1108
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:03,086
There's no time to lie down, mother

1109
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:06,127
This is the time to fight... 
fight to this beast

1110
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:07,126
All Vienna knows

1111
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:09,789
There's nothing to hide... nothing

1112
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:11,764
Help me, mother... quickly

1113
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:12,527
Quickly

1114
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:13,692
I'm frightened

1115
01:21:13,768 --> 01:21:16,032
Oh, there's nothing to be frightened of
mother darling... 

1116
01:21:16,104 --> 01:21:17,662
There's nothing to be frightened of

1117
01:21:17,739 --> 01:21:19,730
I'm going to the opera, that's all

1118
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:21,799
I'm going to the opera to Johann

1119
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,435
I knew there's something

1120
01:21:23,511 --> 01:21:27,470
Love is no good, mother darling... 
for women like us

1121
01:21:27,582 --> 01:21:29,516
That's for the other kind... 

1122
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:30,608
for women who take... 

1123
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:31,982
for women who steal... 

1124
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:33,782
for women who have no hearts

1125
01:21:33,855 --> 01:21:36,255
If you've no other competence, leave it

1126
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:38,087
Can't they, mother?

1127
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,152
My jewels?

1128
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:41,889
Where are my jewels?

1129
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:46,528
I have as much right to wear my jewels
as she

1130
01:21:46,668 --> 01:21:49,296
From now on, I'll never go out
without my jewels

1131
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:58,903
Poldi darling, if you really don't want
to go to the opera,

1132
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:00,174
you don't have to

1133
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:01,078
Maybe I upset you

1134
01:22:01,182 --> 01:22:02,706
Now you're too excited

1135
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:04,376
No, mother... I'm not excited

1136
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:06,386
I was for a moment, but not anymore

1137
01:22:06,855 --> 01:22:09,790
The performance won't end without me

1138
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:13,419
I'm also bound to... a big part, you know

1139
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:16,021
I'm bound to be the star of Johanrs opera,

1140
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:17,189
not that woman

1141
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:18,960
She is not stealing anymore

1142
01:22:19,034 --> 01:22:21,559
And in his heart, Johann will be glad

1143
01:25:38,032 --> 01:25:40,364
Bravo, Strauss

1144
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:54,310
The world is at your feet tonight

1145
01:25:54,349 --> 01:25:58,615
My world is beside me... 
we belong together

1146
01:25:58,686 --> 01:25:59,710
I always know it

1147
01:25:59,787 --> 01:26:00,845
I know it now

1148
01:26:00,922 --> 01:26:02,446
I'll go with you to Budapest tonight

1149
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:05,653
Darling, in 2 hours we'll be
in the Danube

1150
01:26:06,427 --> 01:26:08,918
Oh, Carla... you were wonderful

1151
01:26:09,063 --> 01:26:11,725
Thank you... hurry

1152
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:18,271
How do you do, Mrs. Strauss?

1153
01:26:19,407 --> 01:26:23,104
Well, what do you think of Strauss
tonight?

1154
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:25,808
Did you ever see him so magnificent?

1155
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,440
He's going to Budapest with you tonight

1156
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:31,611
Yes, my dear... he's going with me

1157
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,682
We might as well face it, don't you?

1158
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:37,758
He loves me and I love him

1159
01:26:38,226 --> 01:26:40,717
There's nothing, not anyone can do
about it

1160
01:26:40,795 --> 01:26:43,457
You can't... I can't... he can't

1161
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:45,931
Yes, I know that

1162
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:49,562
If I were you, I'd have spared myself
from this embarrassment

1163
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:52,567
I'd ask you to give a message for me

1164
01:26:52,974 --> 01:26:55,067
I know he won't leave without... 

1165
01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:57,407
without explaining everything

1166
01:26:57,712 --> 01:27:01,011
That would be difficult for him... 
for us both

1167
01:27:01,482 --> 01:27:03,473
Tell him there's no need of it

1168
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:05,451
Tell him he's quite free

1169
01:27:05,486 --> 01:27:06,919
He needs not to worry about me

1170
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:08,615
Will you tell him that?

1171
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:11,249
You're very unselfish

1172
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:13,654
or unexpectedly clever

1173
01:27:14,662 --> 01:27:17,961
For charity, I like it

1174
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:22,803
Believe me, Madam... 
I know it sounds silly

1175
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:26,602
But if his happiness is with you... 

1176
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:31,273
I think I love his happiness more than
I do him

1177
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:34,907
You probably deserve him more than I do

1178
01:27:34,983 --> 01:27:36,644
But he's going with me

1179
01:27:37,385 --> 01:27:41,082
So don't ever fool yourself
to sacrifice again

1180
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:43,419
Happiness is in your own heart... 

1181
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:45,618
not in someone else's

1182
01:27:45,727 --> 01:27:47,388
I found that out

1183
01:27:47,462 --> 01:27:49,828
I think you'll feel differently after

1184
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:52,126
you've been with Johann for a while

1185
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:55,160
You see... Johann isn't like other man

1186
01:27:55,536 --> 01:27:58,972
If you hurt him, you might as well
kill him

1187
01:27:59,073 --> 01:28:01,405
And you've to watch him carefully... 

1188
01:28:01,442 --> 01:28:04,741
so he doesn't fall off the horse in the street

1189
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:10,342
And if you don't take care when he's
working, he'll starve to death

1190
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:15,311
Poldi

1191
01:28:16,024 --> 01:28:17,855
Poldi... I want to talk to you

1192
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:19,688
They told me you were here

1193
01:28:19,761 --> 01:28:22,559
Yes, I came here to congratulate
Madam Donner

1194
01:28:22,997 --> 01:28:27,900
Johann, you're wonderful... 
you both are wonderful

1195
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:29,231
Did you see the audiences?

1196
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:30,896
Everybody was excited

1197
01:28:31,005 --> 01:28:32,131
One hand clapped so hard and

1198
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:35,209
nearly fell off his box to the orchestra

1199
01:28:36,911 --> 01:28:40,005
I must go now, l... I must find my parents

1200
01:28:40,114 --> 01:28:43,049
because they get lost in place like this

1201
01:28:43,117 --> 01:28:44,448
You know Mama and Papa

1202
01:28:44,519 --> 01:28:45,781
Wait a minute, Mrs. Strauss... 

1203
01:28:45,853 --> 01:28:47,582
you can't run away from this

1204
01:28:47,689 --> 01:28:49,953
He won't go without talking to you

1205
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:54,823
Johann, she knows... I'll continue waiting
in my dressing room

1206
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:57,195
Poldi, l... 

1207
01:28:57,298 --> 01:28:59,892
Johann... you mustrt... I understand

1208
01:28:59,967 --> 01:29:01,059
But Poldi, I must tell you... 

1209
01:29:01,102 --> 01:29:02,296
call the man is called what you'll

1210
01:29:02,403 --> 01:29:05,304
Oh, Johann... 
why did you torture yourself?

1211
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,103
Why didn't you tell me early?

1212
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:10,076
You always come to me
when you're in trouble

1213
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:13,506
Why can't you find someone
won'thy of you?

1214
01:29:13,548 --> 01:29:17,609
I had... I've been happier than most women
in their lives

1215
01:29:17,652 --> 01:29:20,143
Everything comes to an end... everything

1216
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:22,416
And the world goes on just the same... 

1217
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:23,787
even when we die

1218
01:29:23,891 --> 01:29:24,516
Poldi

1219
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:29,324
Don't talk anymore, Johann... 
everything is the way it should be

1220
01:29:29,764 --> 01:29:32,858
Yes, he is here

1221
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:34,728
Please... 

1222
01:29:34,802 --> 01:29:42,004
I've bought the ticket to the
Danube Boat Sail for Budapest tonight

1223
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:43,509
Remember, if you've anything written... 

1224
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:46,046
give me the first call

1225
01:29:46,114 --> 01:29:47,741
Don't forget that, Madam

1226
01:29:47,815 --> 01:29:50,682
Keep an eye on him... 
you know those Hungarian women

1227
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:53,877
I do my best... goodnight, Johann

1228
01:29:53,955 --> 01:29:56,287
Goodnight... Poldi

1229
01:29:56,357 --> 01:29:58,120
I must pack except for his music

1230
01:29:58,192 --> 01:30:00,251
I don't know what to do with his stanza

1231
01:30:00,328 --> 01:30:03,456
He leaves everything
for the last minute... goodnight

1232
01:30:03,498 --> 01:30:07,127
Don't worry, I'll attend to everything... 
goodnight

1233
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:10,203
Mrs. Strauss, permit me
to congratulate you

1234
01:30:10,271 --> 01:30:12,865
You must be the happiest woman
in Vienna tonight

1235
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,336
Goodnight

1236
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:15,134
Congratulations

1237
01:30:15,209 --> 01:30:16,107
Goodnight

1238
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:16,608
Mrs. Strauss

1239
01:30:16,711 --> 01:30:17,678
Goodnight

1240
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:19,110
Oh, Mrs. Strauss... 
goodnight, Mrs. Strauss

1241
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:20,238
Goodnight

1242
01:30:20,314 --> 01:30:21,008
Goodnight

1243
01:30:21,115 --> 01:30:22,639
Goodnight

1244
01:30:40,201 --> 01:30:42,169
What are you thinking about?

1245
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:47,273
Oh, l... I was thinking the first time
we were in carriage together

1246
01:30:47,375 --> 01:30:49,605
Remember the old coachman?

1247
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:52,076
And the star is hanging over
on his harmonica

1248
01:30:52,113 --> 01:30:54,047
And Rosy... remember Rosy?

1249
01:30:54,148 --> 01:30:55,376
His old white horse

1250
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:59,876
Yes... and he claimed it understood
everything he said

1251
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:03,154
Have you ever been on the Danube?

1252
01:31:03,257 --> 01:31:04,383
Of course, you have

1253
01:31:04,492 --> 01:31:07,086
Yes, but not this way, Johann

1254
01:31:07,161 --> 01:31:10,653
I never have... 
when we were crazy youngsters

1255
01:31:10,731 --> 01:31:14,394
We used to stand on the bank and
throw rocks on the boat

1256
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:16,232
Bad little boys

1257
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:18,431
I remember... 
once the police caught us and... 

1258
01:31:18,506 --> 01:31:20,474
and Poldi cried because she thought... 

1259
01:31:21,175 --> 01:31:24,201
Well, we... we nearly went to the jail

1260
01:31:29,984 --> 01:31:32,077
Well, here we're

1261
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,954
Yes, here we're

1262
01:31:40,528 --> 01:31:43,088
Oh, the night is so beautiful

1263
01:31:43,931 --> 01:31:44,693
Yes

1264
01:31:44,765 --> 01:31:46,289
Shall I take your baggage?

1265
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,061
Take only these 2

1266
01:31:48,102 --> 01:31:49,296
Yes, Madam

1267
01:31:53,741 --> 01:31:55,402
Carla?

1268
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:58,445
There's another horror between us
in the carriage

1269
01:31:58,746 --> 01:32:03,513
It'll always be so... goodbye, Johann

1270
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:08,546
Something difficult and honest

1271
01:32:08,656 --> 01:32:10,317
had to be said

1272
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:12,951
You just like you to say

1273
01:32:15,897 --> 01:32:18,798
There's the wave we call again

1274
01:32:21,802 --> 01:32:22,632
Now I know

1275
01:32:22,737 --> 01:32:25,205
why part of my heart
will always love you

1276
01:32:25,907 --> 01:32:27,306
It has only been away from you

1277
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:30,606
I can be content so little with your heart

1278
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:33,839
Vanity... thy name is woman

1279
01:32:33,948 --> 01:32:38,647
And the earth and the blood of life
itself is vanity

1280
01:32:47,929 --> 01:32:49,897
Remember me, Johann

1281
01:32:49,964 --> 01:32:52,398
All the days in my life

1282
01:33:11,852 --> 01:33:14,047
Are you listening, Johann?

1283
01:33:15,122 --> 01:33:17,750
You wrote it for me, didn't you?

1284
01:33:17,959 --> 01:33:20,154
Every note and every word

1285
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:23,424
Give it to me... will you give it to me?

1286
01:33:23,531 --> 01:33:25,522
It has always been yours

1287
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:33,518
THE BLUE DANUBE:

1288
01:36:53,974 --> 01:36:56,169
Waltz by Johann Strauss Jr.

1289
01:38:15,823 --> 01:38:18,087
THE IMPEREIAL PALACE, VIENNA

1290
01:38:18,225 --> 01:38:23,162
43 YEARS LATER

1291
01:38:33,274 --> 01:38:36,801
Your Majesty... Mr. Johann Strauss

1292
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:39,004
Johann Strauss?

1293
01:38:39,146 --> 01:38:41,876
It has been a long time
since I've seen him... 

1294
01:38:41,949 --> 01:38:43,917
50 years, isn't it?

1295
01:38:44,318 --> 01:38:47,253
Well, perhaps it's a trifle less... 
Your Majesty

1296
01:38:47,321 --> 01:38:49,152
Ask him to come in

1297
01:38:57,331 --> 01:38:59,595
Mr. Johann Strauss

1298
01:39:00,534 --> 01:39:03,264
Mr. Johann Strauss

1299
01:39:04,738 --> 01:39:07,901
Mr. Johann Strauss

1300
01:39:18,686 --> 01:39:21,450
I knew you once, Mrs. Strauss

1301
01:39:21,555 --> 01:39:25,889
Your memory is very great... 
Count Hobenfried

1302
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:29,452
With your permission... 
now, remember, Johann

1303
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:30,690
Yes... I know

1304
01:39:30,764 --> 01:39:33,858
Take 3 steps into the room... 
bow from the waist... 

1305
01:39:33,934 --> 01:39:37,495
be courteous... respectful... modest... I know

1306
01:39:37,938 --> 01:39:40,372
I shouldn't trust him, Madam

1307
01:39:41,342 --> 01:39:45,540
You see, with the reputation you have... 
my sweetheart

1308
01:39:48,415 --> 01:39:52,351
Now then... go

1309
01:40:05,332 --> 01:40:08,324
Come... cut out that nonsense, Strauss

1310
01:40:09,403 --> 01:40:14,841
It took me a long time to have
an audience to you, didn't it?

1311
01:40:14,908 --> 01:40:16,569
But finally I succeeded

1312
01:40:16,643 --> 01:40:18,474
Your Majesty, l... 

1313
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:22,312
You were always on such excellent term... 
werert we?

1314
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:28,484
Tell me... is there still anything
about me that I'd annoy you?

1315
01:40:29,623 --> 01:40:31,488
No... Your Majesty

1316
01:40:31,558 --> 01:40:35,585
I think you called me a stuffed shirt

1317
01:40:35,662 --> 01:40:37,789
And without thinking further,

1318
01:40:37,865 --> 01:40:40,993
I think I was a stuffed shirt

1319
01:40:41,101 --> 01:40:43,899
We were very young then, Your Majesty

1320
01:40:43,971 --> 01:40:47,600
And now you're king of Vienna

1321
01:40:47,674 --> 01:40:49,869
I don't know what Your Majesty means

1322
01:40:49,977 --> 01:40:50,909
Oh, you don't?

1323
01:40:50,978 --> 01:40:52,411
Well, come with me, Johann

1324
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:55,004
I'll show you what I mean

1325
01:41:08,929 --> 01:41:10,658
This can't be happening to me

1326
01:41:10,764 --> 01:41:12,561
It could happen only to you

1327
01:41:12,633 --> 01:41:16,967
Vienna is giving you the love that
you gave Vienna
