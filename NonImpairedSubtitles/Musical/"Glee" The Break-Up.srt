1
00:00:01,174 --> 00:00:02,591
(bell ringing)

2
00:00:13,386 --> 00:00:15,437
Too late. I saw them.

3
00:00:15,472 --> 00:00:17,189
Saw what?
Your free lunch tickets.

4
00:00:17,223 --> 00:00:18,223
Sucks being poor.

5
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:23,345
Before the recession,
my mom was a real estate agent.

6
00:00:23,363 --> 00:00:24,363
Solid middle class.

7
00:00:24,397 --> 00:00:25,717
Now she's the only black waitress

8
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:27,066
working at the Lima Country Club,

9
00:00:27,117 --> 00:00:28,617
taking orders from a bunch of

10
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:30,519
rich old white guys who barely tip.

11
00:00:30,537 --> 00:00:32,297
And it kills me,
she's working extra shifts

12
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,418
to pay for my dance lessons.

13
00:00:33,419 --> 00:00:35,624
Wait... you dance?

14
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:36,938
Let's just keep that between us.

15
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:41,547
Oh... young love.

16
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:44,061
BLAINE: Do you remember when
you first started dating Santana

17
00:00:44,062 --> 00:00:45,102
and I started dating Kurt,

18
00:00:45,103 --> 00:00:48,703
back before everyone was
so busy and so... far away.

19
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:50,539
Things were so much simpler.

20
00:00:50,557 --> 00:00:53,575
We had so much more hope and innocence.

21
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,210
Every day was just like Valentine's Day.

22
00:00:55,211 --> 00:00:56,962
We're still young.

23
00:00:56,996 --> 00:00:59,064
Shouldn't we still be
experiencing those things?

24
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,818
(bell ringing)

25
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:05,716

26
00:01:09,442 --> 00:01:10,776
Hey.

27
00:01:10,827 --> 00:01:12,060
Somebody slept late.

28
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:13,746
It's lunchtime.

29
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,564
Do you want a Croque Madame?

30
00:01:15,582 --> 00:01:17,750
We didn't go to bed till late.

31
00:01:17,784 --> 00:01:19,618
Thank God for earplugs.

32
00:01:19,669 --> 00:01:21,829
I love you both but I don't
want to hear any of that.

33
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,622
We didn't do anything.

34
00:01:23,673 --> 00:01:27,926
He didn't even talk to me,
we just, like, laid there.

35
00:01:30,463 --> 00:01:32,131
I'm gonna take this down to the park

36
00:01:32,182 --> 00:01:33,748
and watch drug deals go down.

37
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:36,084
It's good to see you again, Finn.

38
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:37,102
You, too, little brother.

39
00:01:37,103 --> 00:01:39,772
Um, so, are you hungry?

40
00:01:39,806 --> 00:01:41,089
Can I make you some eggs?

41
00:01:41,107 --> 00:01:42,941
Yeah. Thanks.

42
00:01:45,528 --> 00:01:47,529
Wow, this place is awesome.

43
00:01:47,564 --> 00:01:49,865
It's not the ideal neighborhood, but

44
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:52,701
at least we can sort of see Manhattan.

45
00:01:55,705 --> 00:01:57,623
I can't do this, Finn.

46
00:01:57,657 --> 00:01:59,657
I don't understand.
I don't know what's going on.

47
00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:02,611
Why are you here and why aren't
you in your uniform?

48
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:04,997
Because I'm not in the Army.

49
00:02:05,048 --> 00:02:08,167
Well, I was, for 16 days...

50
00:02:08,218 --> 00:02:09,501
(Drill Sergeant yelling)

51
00:02:09,552 --> 00:02:10,886
FINN: <i>It wasn't that bad.</i>

52
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,320
<i>I really felt like I was someplace.</i>

53
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:13,361
<i>I could make a difference,</i>

54
00:02:13,362 --> 00:02:15,002
<i>and I'm pretty used to getting yelled at,</i>

55
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:16,124
<i>so I was doing okay.</i>

56
00:02:16,142 --> 00:02:17,702
<i>Then, one day, I was cleaning Rachel...</i>

57
00:02:17,736 --> 00:02:19,296
<i>they make you give your rifle a name...</i>

58
00:02:19,297 --> 00:02:19,812
(gunshot)

59
00:02:19,846 --> 00:02:21,180
Right through my thigh.

60
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:22,731
Thank God it didn't hit any bone.

61
00:02:22,765 --> 00:02:26,018
I got a semi-honorable
discharge.

62
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:28,136
So I've been backpacking through Georgia

63
00:02:28,154 --> 00:02:29,638
for the past couple months.

64
00:02:29,656 --> 00:02:31,523
I'm sorry I didn't call you, but...

65
00:02:31,574 --> 00:02:33,158
but I was just so embarrassed.

66
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:36,495
I mean, I left with

67
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:38,847
so much certainty and confidence.

68
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:42,100
I was gonna redeem my dad
and make you proud.

69
00:02:44,587 --> 00:02:46,821
I couldn't face you
seeing me as a Lima loser.

70
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,158
Enough of this...
enough lumping around.

71
00:02:50,176 --> 00:02:51,710
All right, so what?

72
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:52,827
The Army didn't work out.

73
00:02:52,846 --> 00:02:54,096
Plans change.

74
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,599
You're here now, with me, in...

75
00:02:57,634 --> 00:03:00,152
in the greatest city in the whole world

76
00:03:00,186 --> 00:03:02,170
and what a better place for you and I

77
00:03:02,188 --> 00:03:03,605
to find you a new dream.

78
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,607
Like what? Before the Army,

79
00:03:05,642 --> 00:03:08,510
you applied to Pace to be an actor.

80
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:11,947
You know, that was obviously
not the right school but...

81
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:13,866
I don't know, maybe NYADA is.

82
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,850
I mean, why don't you come with me

83
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:17,536
to all of my classes this week,

84
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,688
and if you love it,
then you can move in here

85
00:03:19,706 --> 00:03:22,190
and we'll spend the whole
year just finding a way

86
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,625
for you to get in.

87
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:27,713
You serious?

88
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:33,535
I love it here, but something
has always been missing.

89
00:03:33,553 --> 00:03:37,339
I let you go once and I'm not
gonna let it happen again.

90
00:03:41,144 --> 00:03:45,564
I mean, I'm not jealous,
I just think that it's insane

91
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:47,159
that all Porcelain had to do

92
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,600
to get an internship
with Vogue.com

93
00:03:48,651 --> 00:03:51,153
is take photos of every ridiculous outfit

94
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:52,821
he's ever paired with a Cossack hat,

95
00:03:52,855 --> 00:03:54,239
and a see-through raincoat

96
00:03:54,274 --> 00:03:56,057
and then show up at an interview

97
00:03:56,075 --> 00:03:58,727
where he is lauded as a visionary

98
00:03:58,745 --> 00:04:00,985
because his jodhpurs happened
to match his riding crop.

99
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:02,986
Well, you know, you could
follow your dream, too.

100
00:04:02,987 --> 00:04:04,467
Your mom gave you that money and said

101
00:04:04,468 --> 00:04:06,228
you could go to New York,
too, iyou wanted.

102
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:07,189
I like being in college.

103
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,254
My schedule is crazy but I love being

104
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:11,911
a cheerleader and I like the idea that

105
00:04:11,912 --> 00:04:13,792
I'm never more than
a few hours away from you.

106
00:04:13,843 --> 00:04:15,243
Can't you do laundry at school?

107
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:17,679
Mm-mm. My first week there,
I heard a rumor

108
00:04:17,714 --> 00:04:19,631
that all the water in Louisville

109
00:04:19,682 --> 00:04:22,083
is just purified runoff from
the Kentucky Derby stables.

110
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:23,302
Nasty. But...

111
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:24,970
mo importantly, I promised myself that

112
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:26,921
I would only do laundry at home, that way,

113
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,857
no matter how busy I got,
I would be forced

114
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:31,092
to come home every few weeks,

115
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,644
and then I'd get to see you.

116
00:04:36,115 --> 00:04:37,599
Are you okay?

117
00:04:37,617 --> 00:04:38,767
Yeah, sorry.

118
00:04:38,785 --> 00:04:40,770
I was up late last night,

119
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:42,771
reading <i>Desecration:</i>
<i>Antichrist Takes the Throne.</i>

120
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:44,773
It's the ninth book in
the Left Behind series

121
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,793
of the apocalyptic Christian
novels about the end times

122
00:04:47,827 --> 00:04:50,945
and the rise of the Antichrist,
who name is Nicolae Carpathia,

123
00:04:50,964 --> 00:04:53,048
or Barack Obama, depending on who you ask.

124
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:55,617
Brit, those Left Behind books
are really intense.

125
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:57,285
What teacher is making you read those?

126
00:04:57,303 --> 00:04:59,120
And don't tell me that
Mr. Schue is doing

127
00:04:59,138 --> 00:05:00,806
Christian music week.

128
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,058
It's not a class,
it's an after-school club

129
00:05:03,092 --> 00:05:06,895
that Sam and Joe and Kitty
and Dottie Kazatori are in.

130
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:08,296
And you should come tomorrow.

131
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:09,648
Who's Dottie Kazatori?

132
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:11,066
She's Tina's assistant.

133
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,302
Everyone graduated and things got weird.

134
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,305
(school bell ringing, phone buzzing)

135
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:19,307
Hey, stranger.

136
00:05:19,325 --> 00:05:21,743
(phone ringing) Hey. Uh...

137
00:05:21,778 --> 00:05:23,161
Crap! Can you hold on
one second?

138
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:26,704
Isabelle Wright's office.
How can I help you?

139
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:28,394
Um, it's me, Kurt.

140
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,035
(phone ringing) Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

141
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:31,726
Uh, look, ve taken over Isabelle's phones

142
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:33,647
for the week, and they
just won't stop ringing.

143
00:05:33,648 --> 00:05:34,862
It's... it's okay.

144
00:05:34,863 --> 00:05:37,343
If you want to call me back
later, we can talk then. I can't.

145
00:05:37,344 --> 00:05:38,904
Isabelle says we have to get the column

146
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,345
on the Web site by midnight tonight.

147
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,610
(phone ringing, Kurt groans)

148
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:42,931
Look, I know this is frustrating.

149
00:05:42,965 --> 00:05:44,266
It's frustrating for me, too,

150
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,934
and I don't want to miss our phone dates

151
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:49,688
but, you know, this-this
could be a career for me.

152
00:05:49,722 --> 00:05:51,440
I get that; I-I do.

153
00:05:51,474 --> 00:05:52,724
I really get it.

154
00:05:52,775 --> 00:05:54,342
It's just...

155
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,178
I... really miss you.

156
00:05:57,196 --> 00:05:59,281
A lot, okay?

157
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:01,115
I miss talking to you
and I miss hugging you

158
00:06:01,116 --> 00:06:02,734
and I miss messing around with you...

159
00:06:02,785 --> 00:06:04,686
Me, too.

160
00:06:04,704 --> 00:06:06,738
But you're coming in two weeks, right?

161
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:10,358
I know, but... what am I
supposed to do until then,

162
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:11,910

00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:35,247
I didn't even bring a suit.

00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:36,991
Then you can't wear Dad jeans

235

and a rugby shirt to Callbacks.

What's Callbacks?

237
00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:40,058
This amazing bar

238
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:41,419
that all the NYADA students go to,

239
00:09:41,454 --> 00:09:42,954
and Friday nights are the best

240
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:44,445
because everybody gets up and sings,

241
00:09:44,446 --> 00:09:45,846
and it's where we're going tonight,

242
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:47,575
and it's gonna be great.

243
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:50,912

go to a karaoke bar?

244
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,250
Come on, Finn, we'll let you
sing "Don't Stop Believin',"

245
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:54,491
or something equally uplifting.

246
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:55,452
I don't... I don't know.

247
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:57,791
I'm so out of practice, I
haven't even sang in the shower

248
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,437
since Nationals.

Blaine!

252
00:10:05,978 --> 00:10:07,595
Hi.

253
00:10:07,613 --> 00:10:08,613
KURT: This is amazing!

254
00:10:08,648 --> 00:10:09,688
But I wasn't expecting you

255
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:10,699
for another two weeks.

256
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:12,333
I know, I just couldn't wait any longer.

257
00:10:12,334 --> 00:10:13,201
I miss you too much.

258
00:10:13,235 --> 00:10:15,153
Oh, I miss you, too.
So good to see you.

259
00:10:15,204 --> 00:10:16,655
Wait!
I can't believe you're here.

260
00:10:16,706 --> 00:10:17,706
I missed you so much. Hi.

261
00:10:17,707 --> 00:10:19,291
Hi. Oh, Finn!

262
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:20,959
What are you doing here?

263
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:23,662
I'm... not really sure
at the moment, but...

264
00:10:23,713 --> 00:10:25,630
It's fantastic...
we're all together here.

265
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:27,132

267
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,433
You okay?

268
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:38,101
You seem a little...

269
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,620
I'm-I'm great.

270
00:10:39,654 --> 00:10:42,105
It was just a...
it was a rough flight.

271
00:10:42,123 --> 00:10:43,203
I had a middle seat because

272
00:10:43,204 --> 00:10:44,644
I booked the ticket
so last-minute.

273
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,109
Well, I, for one, am glad you did.

274
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:48,161
It's our first night out in New York.

275
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:49,296
We'll never forget this.

276
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:52,616
Uh, Coke and, uh...

277
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:54,384
Oh, amaretto sour,
please... virgin.

278
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:57,170
It's good. Hey, Finn, Rachel.

279
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:58,338
Brody, hi.

280
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:59,949
Hey, Brody, good to see you again, man.

281
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,870
Yeah, you too, you too.

282
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:03,460
So, how's the, uh,
visit been going so far?

283
00:11:03,478 --> 00:11:05,062
Amazing. I took him to school

284
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:07,180
to get the full NYADA experience together.

285
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:09,511
Cool. Well, in that case,
I hope you're singing tonight.

286
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:10,809
You haven't really been to NYADA

287
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,050
until you've sung at Callbacks.

288
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:13,731
This is what I've been trying to tell him,

289
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:15,252
and I really, really want him to sing.

290
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,910
"Give Your Heart a Break" with me, but...

291
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:18,659
But I'm not a student, so...

292
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:21,161
Well, you're with Rachel,
which makes you honorary.

293
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:23,075
And I'm buddies
with Pascal, the piano player.

294
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:24,756
And the song works better as a duet, so...

295
00:11:24,757 --> 00:11:27,534
Well, why don't you guys sing it together?

296
00:11:27,585 --> 00:11:29,670
It's a NYADA tradition, right?
And you guys

297
00:11:29,704 --> 00:11:30,671
are both NYADA students.

298
00:11:30,705 --> 00:11:32,322
Finn.

299
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,373
Yeah.

300
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:35,208
All right, let's do it.

301
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:41,264
I love you.

302
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:45,802
Wish me luck.

303
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:50,173
I'm so nervous.
It's my Off-Off Broadway debut.

304
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:52,392
BRODY: It's all good.
I got your back.

sounded great together.

Oh, I wish you would have

417
00:17:08,676 --> 00:17:10,043
gotten up there and sang with me.

418
00:17:10,094 --> 00:17:11,928
Yeah, I just...
I don't fit in here.

419
00:17:11,963 --> 00:17:13,496
This place is just too big.

420
00:17:13,514 --> 00:17:14,597
It moves too fast.

421
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:15,932
People are too talented.

422
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:17,934
No. I felt that way
when I first moved here.

423
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:20,003
Even in Ohio, I knew
you were meant for this.

424
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:21,671
I'm just not.

425
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:24,190
So, that was... moving.

426
00:17:24,225 --> 00:17:28,311
I guess I'm kind of
wondering why that was.

427
00:17:30,314 --> 00:17:34,517
Well, you know, I, uh...
I really missed you.

428
00:17:34,535 --> 00:17:35,952
I miss you, too.

429
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:38,855
And I'm really glad that you're here.

430
00:17:38,873 --> 00:17:43,526
But you've been so emotional
and weirdly sad.

431
00:17:43,544 --> 00:17:46,713
Please stop pretending
that there's nothing wrong.

432
00:17:52,003 --> 00:17:54,771
I was with someone.

433
00:17:57,008 --> 00:18:00,376
So, are you sure you and that
Brody guy are just friends?

434
00:18:00,394 --> 00:18:02,896
Look, I told you, everything's...
Just, ple-please...

435
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,647
don't lie to me.

436
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:08,318
I couldn't get in touch with you, okay?

437
00:18:08,352 --> 00:18:10,219
I-I... you weren't
answering my calls

438
00:18:10,237 --> 00:18:11,404
or my text messages.

439
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:12,570
I didn't know where you were

440
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:14,491
or even if you were okay.
So you were with him.

441
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:15,725
I kissed him, but that's it.

442
00:18:15,743 --> 00:18:17,303
Okay, and only just because you told me

443
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,184
that you wanted me to be free.
I can't believe

444
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:20,505
I even said that.
I'm so stupid.

445
00:18:20,506 --> 00:18:21,664
It was Sebastian, wasn't it?

446
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:24,233
No, it... it wasn't Sebastian,

447
00:18:24,251 --> 00:18:25,452
but it doesn't...

448
00:18:25,503 --> 00:18:26,903
It didn't mean anything.

449
00:18:26,921 --> 00:18:29,238
It was just a hook-up, okay?
Who was it?

450
00:18:29,256 --> 00:18:30,856
It doesn't matter who it was with, Kurt.

451
00:18:30,857 --> 00:18:32,759
What matters is that I was by myself.

452
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:34,577
I needed you.

453
00:18:34,595 --> 00:18:37,680
I needed you around,
and you weren't there.

454
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:39,749
And I was lonely, and I'm...

455
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:41,417
I'm really sorry.

456
00:18:41,435 --> 00:18:43,269
You don't think that I've been lonely?

457
00:18:43,304 --> 00:18:45,088
You don't think that I've had temptations?

458
00:18:45,106 --> 00:18:47,924
But I didn't act on it
because I knew what it meant.

459
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:49,926
It meant something
horrible and awful and...

460
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:51,928
I'm so sorry, Kurt.

KURT: You can't just run away.

499
00:21:16,178 --> 00:21:17,612
Dude, you totally spooked me.

500
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:19,197
I thought I was the only one awake.

501
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,683
Been waiting for somebody to come out.

502
00:21:21,717 --> 00:21:23,535
I was hoping it'd be Blaine.

503
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:26,204
You guys okay?

504
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,125
I kind of feel like I'm going to die.

505
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,027
Guess I don't have to ask you

506
00:21:32,061 --> 00:21:33,511
what you're doing, apparently.

507
00:21:33,546 --> 00:21:35,130
I'll talk to her later about it.

508
00:21:35,164 --> 00:21:37,549
I... I just got
to get away for a bit.

509
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,384
Six months ago, did you ever think

510
00:21:39,418 --> 00:21:41,253
that things would be like this?

511
00:21:43,222 --> 00:21:45,840
Sometimes, I miss high school, you know?

512
00:21:45,891 --> 00:21:48,260
Come on, give me a hug before I go.

513
00:21:58,771 --> 00:22:02,274
Do you want me to say anything to Rachel?

514
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,244
No.

515
00:22:08,864 --> 00:22:12,033
(school bell ringing)

516
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:15,188
Hi, Boobless. It is my duty
as a soldier of the Lord

517
00:22:15,189 --> 00:22:17,589
to invite you to McKinley's
newest and most important club,

518
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,110
the Left Behind Club. Kitty thinks
the end of times is coming.

519
00:22:20,111 --> 00:22:22,511
It's a fact that the Book of
Revelations predicted Twitter.

520
00:22:22,524 --> 00:22:24,404
It's one of the seven
signs of the apocalypse,

521
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,681
along with porn,
unexplainable weather anomalies,

522
00:22:26,716 --> 00:22:29,718
Martian rovers, Barney Frank,
the Middle East, and MSNBC.

523
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:31,289
The Left Behind Club accepts everyone,

524
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,690
even losers and lezzies, so
your whole Glee Club's invited.

525
00:22:33,724 --> 00:22:36,284
Well, you're welcome to join us
as long as you're not a Muslim.

526
00:22:36,285 --> 00:22:38,560
It's like Kirk Cameron said,
it's never too late...

527
00:22:38,611 --> 00:22:39,944
until it's too late.

528
00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:41,818
Okay, everybody, listen up.

529
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,939
Y'all are sinners, and you
better get right with God

530
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,940
toot sweet, because Jesus
just logged onto Orbitz

531
00:22:45,941 --> 00:22:47,901
and booked himself
a plane ticket back to Earth.

532
00:22:47,902 --> 00:22:49,422
See, he's got an awesome dad named God

533
00:22:49,423 --> 00:22:51,623
who's throwing him a bitchin'
party called Armageddon,

534
00:22:51,624 --> 00:22:53,625
where he's gonna get to
kick off his sandals

535
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:55,877
dance a little bit,
judge the crap out of everybody.

536
00:22:55,911 --> 00:22:57,295
SANTANA: Hi. I have a question.

537
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,639
What the hell are you talking about?
Um, the Rapture.

538
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,800
When the end times come,
the true believers in Christ

539
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:03,681
will be lifted up,
body and soul, into heaven,

540
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,162
leaving everyone else to duke it out.

541
00:23:05,163 --> 00:23:06,537
What about those of us

542
00:23:06,555 --> 00:23:08,539
who are still on the fence
about all of this?

543
00:23:08,557 --> 00:23:11,426
I don't know what there is to be
on the fence about, Dottie.

544
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:13,762
Sorry I made you come to this.

545
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:16,598
That's okay.
You're half-Jewish, right?

546
00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:19,601
Mm-hmm. Does that mean you'll
float up to heaven at half speed?

547
00:23:19,652 --> 00:23:21,532
I just heard there's an
elderly Japanese woman

548
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,987
who fell down in the bathroom.

549
00:23:23,022 --> 00:23:24,722
She doesn't speak English,

550
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,275
and she needs your help.
I'll be right back.

551
00:23:27,326 --> 00:23:29,926
Santana, come on, we should help her.
SANTANA: No, wait, Brit...

552
00:23:29,927 --> 00:23:31,727
I'm pretty sure I know
what's going on here.

553
00:23:31,728 --> 00:23:32,781
Okay, everybody, let's go.

554
00:23:32,832 --> 00:23:34,449
Move it, move it, move it!

555
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,584
What's everybody doing?

556
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:38,620
JAKE: Fake Rapture.
It was Kitty's idea.

557
00:23:45,044 --> 00:23:47,979
I can't find any Japanese ladies.

558
00:23:48,013 --> 00:23:50,515
Hello? Where did everyone go?

559
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:53,935
Oh, my God.

560
00:23:53,969 --> 00:23:56,438
We've been left behind.
We've been left behind.

561
00:23:56,472 --> 00:23:59,590
We've been left behind!

562
00:23:59,608 --> 00:24:02,477
That's what it feels like to be
left behind, Dottie Kazatori.

563
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:05,096
JAKE: Kitty! This has
gone way too far, okay?

564
00:24:05,114 --> 00:24:07,598
(Dottie whimpering, mumbling)
Dottie seems... pretty damaged.

565
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:08,783
(Dottie keening)

566
00:24:08,818 --> 00:24:11,035
MARLEY:
I think I'm gonna go, now.

567
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,621
No! Wait. Please don't go.

568
00:24:13,656 --> 00:24:16,941
I just really don't like that Kitty girl.

569
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:19,461
And... I can't believe you do.

570
00:24:21,163 --> 00:24:22,643
Brittany, can-can we
please go home?

571
00:24:22,678 --> 00:24:24,278
I don't think this club is good for you.

572
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,800
I'm not leaving.

573
00:24:25,835 --> 00:24:28,052
Being left behind sucks.
It's just a stupid prank.

574
00:24:28,087 --> 00:24:30,388
You don't get it.
You me behind, and it hurt.

575
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:34,823
(hyperventilating)

576
00:24:34,824 --> 00:24:36,144
That's exactly what it felt like.

577
00:24:38,431 --> 00:24:40,732
(school bell ringing)

578
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:42,150
Oh, my God.

579
00:24:42,184 --> 00:24:43,568
(laughing)

580
00:24:43,602 --> 00:24:45,687
Hey, buddy. Hi.

581
00:24:45,738 --> 00:24:48,406
You look great.
Oh, it's good to see you.

582
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:50,358
Wait, I don't...

583
00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:51,693
Hold on, I don't get it.

584
00:24:51,744 --> 00:24:54,078
What happened...
what happened to the Army?

585
00:24:54,113 --> 00:24:56,080
It... didn't work out.

586
00:24:56,115 --> 00:24:57,515
Okay.

587
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,700
Well, um...

588
00:24:58,751 --> 00:25:00,502
when'd you get in?

589
00:25:00,536 --> 00:25:02,153
Have you spoken with Rachel?
She...

590
00:25:02,171 --> 00:25:04,005
She's been worried sick about you.

591
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:07,375
It's so good to
see you, Mr. Shue.

592
00:25:07,426 --> 00:25:08,993
Can I talk to you about something?

593
00:25:09,011 --> 00:25:10,628
Yeah, of course.

594
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:16,534
(stifled sob)

595
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:18,086
(school bell ringing)

596
00:25:19,815 --> 00:25:22,549
(school bell ringing)

597
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,074
Hey.

598
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:27,642
Um, by the time I got up,

599
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,911
you were already gone.

600
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:30,812
I didn't get a chance
to say good-bye.

601
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,698
Why'd you do that to him?

602
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:34,199
I don't know.

603
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,368
I just...

604
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:38,420
There's no excuse.
He won't talk to me.

605
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:40,706
I don't even know if we're broken up.

606
00:25:40,757 --> 00:25:41,990
Finn! Dude, what's up?

607
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:43,658
I'm just passing through,

608
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:45,344
visiting my mom and Burt,

609
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:47,829
and Mr. Shue said I could
come by if I wanted.

610
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:50,432
Finn Hudson in the house, yo!

611
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:52,000
Do you know who that is?

612
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:53,683
Oh! SAM: Listen up!
For all of you guys

613
00:25:53,684 --> 00:25:55,604
who don't know, this is
Finn Hudson right here.

614
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,606
I thought you joined the Army!
I-I did, but...

615
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,360
WILL: But things don't always work
out the way you planned them to.

616
00:26:00,361 --> 00:26:01,081
And I said to Finn

617
00:26:01,082 --> 00:26:03,442
the same thing I say everyone
who comes through this club:

618
00:26:03,443 --> 00:26:05,514
We're a family, and you're
always welcome here.

619
00:26:05,532 --> 00:26:08,233
Even if you just need to take a
break and think things through.

620
00:26:08,284 --> 00:26:11,236
In any case, we have a lot to do today.

621
00:26:11,287 --> 00:26:12,854
First order of business:

622
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:14,712
Deciding what the fall
musical's going to be.

623
00:26:14,713 --> 00:26:15,690
(cheers) All right!

624
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:17,409
So I'm passing out a list

625
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,411
of possibilities. <i>Peter Pan?</i>

626
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:20,746
<i>Fiorello?</i> What the heck?

627
00:26:20,797 --> 00:26:22,080
Unique wants to do <i>Hedwig.</i>

628
00:26:22,131 --> 00:26:23,691
Uh, Tina wants to do <i>Pacific Overtures,</i>

629
00:26:23,692 --> 00:26:25,634
<i>Miss Saigon,</i> and <i>Flower Drum Song.</i>

630
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:27,028
The challenge is picking something

631
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:28,589
that plays to our collective strengths,

632
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,950
and that won't set off a firestorm

633
00:26:29,951 --> 00:26:31,511
in the community like <i>Rocky Horror</i> did.

634
00:26:31,512 --> 00:26:32,724
You should do <i>Grease.</i>

635
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:33,976
<i>Grease?</i>

636
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,235
I know it 'cause the song

637
00:26:35,236 --> 00:26:37,396
I auditioned for Glee Club
was from <i>Grease,</i> remember?

638
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,981
Yeah. Guys like it.

639
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:40,649
Girls like it.

640
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:43,051
People like my mom like it.
It's about high school,

641
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,386
and growing up, and...

642
00:26:44,404 --> 00:26:46,421
being true to yourself.

643
00:26:46,456 --> 00:26:47,739
Plus, the songs rock.

644
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,057
The wisdom of Solomon...

645
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:50,659
All right.

646
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,661
<i>Grease</i> is the word.

647
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:54,896
Yes! (cheering)

648
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:56,281
Finn's back!

649
00:27:05,508 --> 00:27:07,426
What's that? Open it.

650
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,961
Okay.

651
00:27:13,016 --> 00:27:14,576
I'm officially on the blue ribbon panel

652
00:27:14,577 --> 00:27:15,634
to improve arts education.

653
00:27:15,685 --> 00:27:17,269
Oh, my goodness!

654
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,638
Oh, my goodness, Mr. Schuester
goes to Washington.

655
00:27:19,689 --> 00:27:21,440
Oh, congratulations! Thank you.

656
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:22,348
Thank you. (giggling)

657
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,109
And what would you say
about Miss Pillsbury

658
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:25,527
also going to Washington?

659
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:26,812
, my gosh, I'd love to.

660
00:27:26,863 --> 00:27:28,383
For like a long weekend, or something.

661
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,344
That would be wonderful.

662
00:27:29,345 --> 00:27:30,866
No, like...
like for a few months.

663
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,768
I want you to be there with me.

664
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:36,605
(laughs nervously)

665
00:27:36,623 --> 00:27:38,707
What about my job?

666
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:40,442
That's what a tenure's for.

667
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,377
Your job will be waiting
when you get back.

668
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:46,281
This is not that I'm
afraid of losing my job.

669
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:48,333
This is that I like my job.

670
00:27:48,384 --> 00:27:50,502
Look, this isn't a permanent thing, Emma.

671
00:27:50,553 --> 00:27:52,471
It's like an extended vacation.
A sabbatical.

672
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:53,785
Teachers take them all the time.

673
00:27:53,786 --> 00:27:55,290
I don't want a sabbatical.

674
00:27:55,308 --> 00:27:58,343
But I-I thought you
were supportive of this.

675
00:27:58,394 --> 00:28:00,354
I am, because I know how
much this means to you,

676
00:28:00,355 --> 00:28:01,630
but this is for you.

677
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,298
I didn't know you just expected me

678
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:05,300
to drop my entire life.

679
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:06,801
Emma, I love you.

680
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:08,353
You're my fiancée.

681
00:28:08,404 --> 00:28:10,164
All I'm saying is,
I don't want to be alone

682
00:28:10,165 --> 00:28:11,690
and not be with you.

683
00:28:11,741 --> 00:28:14,101
And I don't want to sit alone
in some hotel room somewhere

684
00:28:14,102 --> 00:28:16,342
doing nothing, while you're off
fulfilling your dreams.

685
00:28:18,581 --> 00:28:21,583
You know, I don't think
what I'm asking is so crazy.

686
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,585
I thought you'd be excited.

687
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,300
So you thought I'd just pop the champagne,

688
00:28:25,301 --> 00:28:27,421
follow you around like an
obedient little puppy dog?

689
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,095
Is that really all you think of me, Will?

690
00:28:29,096 --> 00:28:30,676
No, of course not, Emma.

691
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,661
Oh, come on, we still
need to talk about this.

692
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:33,995
We just did.

693
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:36,098
You just don't like what I have to say.

694
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,719
(distant phone ringing)

695
00:28:52,015 --> 00:28:54,015
Well, someone's either
seriously crushing on you,

696
00:28:54,016 --> 00:28:55,856
or seriously trying to
make up for something.

697
00:28:55,857 --> 00:28:57,035
The latter.

698
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,371
Ouch. He cute?

699
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,523
The cutest.

700
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:03,008
Oh, that sucks. I'm sorry.

701
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:05,043
Hey, you need to
go binge-shopping?

702
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:06,998
Isabelle's summoning us
to the conference room.

703
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:08,630
I can cover for you.

704
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:10,031
I'm okay.

705
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,551
I'll be okay.

706
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:20,671
(school bell ringing)

707
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:24,208
You wanted to see me?

708
00:29:25,593 --> 00:29:28,595
Sophomore year I used
to sit in this back row,

709
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,180
and secretly watch you.

710
00:29:30,215 --> 00:29:33,433
I counted the number of times
you'd smile at me,

711
00:29:33,468 --> 00:29:35,802
and I'd die on days that you didn't.

712
00:29:37,021 --> 00:29:38,388
I miss this place so much.

713
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:40,390
It's where we fell in love.

714
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:42,676
Where I could say things with music,

715
00:29:42,694 --> 00:29:44,678
when words just weren't enough.

716
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:46,196
And I need to tell you something

717
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:48,682
that I don't know how to say.

718

Sad songs make me really sad,

761
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:13,326
and I don't want to be sad.

762
00:32:13,344 --> 00:32:15,495
I haven't been a good girlfriend to you.

763
00:32:15,513 --> 00:32:18,065
I can't come home on the weekends and

764
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:19,999
pretend that things are the way they were,

765
00:32:20,018 --> 00:32:21,218
because they aren't.

766
00:32:22,387 --> 00:32:24,003
And I don't want to be like

767
00:32:24,022 --> 00:32:26,273
all of those other
long-distance relationships,

768
00:32:26,307 --> 00:32:29,276
that, you know, hang in there
for a few months, and then...

769
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,279
break up when someone eventually
cheats or things get weird.

770
00:32:32,313 --> 00:32:34,531
I would never cheat on you.

771
00:32:34,565 --> 00:32:36,733
I know.

772
00:32:36,784 --> 00:32:39,018
I know, and I would
never cheat on you, either,

773
00:32:39,037 --> 00:32:42,739
but... if we're being
completely honest,

774
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,124
I had, well, I guess

775
00:32:44,158 --> 00:32:46,710
the best way to describe it would be...

776
00:32:46,744 --> 00:32:48,712
an energy exchange?

SANTANA: <i>I was cramming for this
really boring sociology class,</i>

778
00:32:52,383 --> 00:32:55,435
<i>and I looked up, and this girl</i>
<i>was staring at me.</i>

779
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,484
<i>She smiled a little too long,</i>

780
00:32:57,485 --> 00:32:58,805
<i>which means she was either crazy,</i>

781
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,774
<i>or a lesbian.</i>

782
00:33:00,808 --> 00:33:03,593
<i>And judging by the stack of</i>
<i>Virginia Woolf she was reading,</i>

783
00:33:03,644 --> 00:33:05,762
<i>she was into me.</i>
<i>So I smiled back.</i>

784
00:33:05,813 --> 00:33:07,431
I had an attraction.

785
00:33:07,482 --> 00:33:08,899
And you,

786
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:11,401
you may have had one
or you might have one,

787
00:33:11,436 --> 00:33:13,520
and that happens.

788
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:18,825
Let's just do the mature thing here, okay?

789
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,777
This is not an official breakup,

790
00:33:20,828 --> 00:33:23,113
but let's just be honest that

791
00:33:23,164 --> 00:33:27,584
long-distance relationships are
almost impossible to maintain.

792
00:33:27,618 --> 00:33:30,236
Because both people are rarely

793
00:33:30,254 --> 00:33:31,838
getting what they need,

794
00:33:31,873 --> 00:33:34,541
especially at our age.

795
00:33:37,545 --> 00:33:40,680
(sniffles) This sounds a
lot like a breakup to me.

796
00:33:40,715 --> 00:33:42,215
You know this isn't working.

797
00:33:44,469 --> 00:33:48,355
You know I will always love you the most.

798
00:33:58,483 --> 00:34:00,150
I love you, too.

799
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:01,368
(school bell ringing)

800
00:34:07,342 --> 00:34:09,459
I'm sorry about the Left Behind club.

801
00:34:09,477 --> 00:34:10,844
That's Kitty's thing, not mine.

802
00:34:10,895 --> 00:34:12,846
I just don't get it.

803
00:34:12,897 --> 00:34:15,515
I don't get why someone like
you is with someone like Kitty.

804
00:34:15,566 --> 00:34:18,185
What do you mean, someone like me?
You act like you don't care

805
00:34:18,236 --> 00:34:21,471
what anyone thinks, but you
obviously are just as desperate

806
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:23,640
to fit in as everyone
else if you'll date her.

807
00:34:23,658 --> 00:34:26,410
You don't know how it feels
to really be on the outside.

808
00:34:26,436 --> 00:34:29,356
The blacks kids think I'm too white;
The white kids think I'm too black.

809
00:34:29,374 --> 00:34:31,334
Kitty's funny and hot,
and yeah, a little crazy,

810
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:32,575
but you know what, she likes me

811
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,583
and when I'm next to her,

812
00:34:33,618 --> 00:34:35,919
no one makes fun of me

813
00:34:35,953 --> 00:34:37,153
for once.

814
00:34:37,171 --> 00:34:38,255
What's happening here?

815
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:39,609
You coveting my man,
itty-bitty?

816
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,875
Kitty, come on, ease up.

817
00:34:41,926 --> 00:34:44,126
I heard they're opening up
a new Ronald McDonald House

818
00:34:44,128 --> 00:34:45,968
in Lima just for you
and your finger-licking,

819
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:47,809
lard-loving,
Gilbert-Grape-looking mama. Hey!

820
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,383
That's enough.

821
00:34:49,434 --> 00:34:50,550
I'm sorry, or what?

822
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:52,335
Or I'm breaking up with you.

823
00:34:52,353 --> 00:34:54,054
You do not want to break up with me, okay?

824
00:34:54,105 --> 00:34:56,345
I am like a bad Carrie Underwood
song once I get going.

825
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:58,275
Yeah, well, I'll take my chances.

826
00:34:58,309 --> 00:34:59,943
We're done.

827
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:02,195
You did this.

828
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,830
Well, you're both gonna regret this turn

829
00:35:03,831 --> 00:35:06,066
of events because I will
tell you one more thing.

830
00:35:06,117 --> 00:35:09,453
Obama's gonna lose.

831
00:35:10,988 --> 00:35:12,205
(screams)

832
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:15,191
Thank you.

833
00:35:15,209 --> 00:35:16,693
You didn't have to do that.

834
00:35:16,711 --> 00:35:19,246
Actually, I think I did.

835
00:35:19,297 --> 00:35:22,382
Hey, do you want to go through
sheet music for <i>Grease?</i>

836
00:35:22,417 --> 00:35:23,917
I was thinking of auditioning

837
00:35:23,968 --> 00:35:25,069
for Sandy, and I think

838
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,470
you'd be really great...
Actually,

839
00:35:26,504 --> 00:35:27,471
I have to go.

840
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:29,222
But I'll see you later

841
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:30,874
in Glee Club, okay?

842
00:35:30,892 --> 00:35:32,893
Okay.

843
00:35:36,063 --> 00:35:38,348
(school bell ringing)

844
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,988
(footsteps approaching)

845
00:35:52,144 --> 00:35:54,112
This is where you proposed to me.

846
00:35:54,146 --> 00:35:57,032
When you did, you reminded me it
was where we had our first date.

847
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,818
It's also where we first met.

848
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:03,655
Do you remember that?

849
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:06,592
Yeah, glee rehearsal.

850
00:36:06,626 --> 00:36:09,294
You, uh, you really freaked me out.

851
00:36:11,998 --> 00:36:14,132
This place is kind of like our Jerusalem.

852
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:16,167
All roads seem

853
00:36:16,185 --> 00:36:19,137
to just lead us back here.

854
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:22,558
I went to your house

855
00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:24,276
and to the tire shop.

856
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:28,013
I should have known you
would've just been here though.

857
00:36:28,031 --> 00:36:29,898
I know it sounds kind of weird,

858
00:36:29,949 --> 00:36:31,950
but I just felt like singing up here.

859
00:36:31,985 --> 00:36:35,070
Seems to have helped me
figure out stuff before, so...

860
00:36:35,121 --> 00:36:37,522
Yeah, I would have just,
you know, come here first,

861
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,141
if you would have picked up your phone

862
00:36:39,175 --> 00:36:41,109
or answered my text messages.

863
00:36:41,144 --> 00:36:43,612
Instead I had to get on a
plane and drive around town,

864
00:36:43,646 --> 00:36:45,330
looking for you, like an idiot.

865
00:36:45,365 --> 00:36:46,965
I'm sorry.
I just needed time to think.

866
00:36:46,966 --> 00:36:48,634
You had four months.

867
00:36:48,668 --> 00:36:51,003
I hated you for what you did
to me at that train station.

868
00:36:51,037 --> 00:36:53,038
I was trying to help you.
I hated you.

869
00:36:53,056 --> 00:36:56,675
But then when I got to
New York, I thought how much

870
00:36:56,709 --> 00:36:58,677
you love me

871
00:36:58,711 --> 00:37:00,545
and how hard that must have been for you.

872
00:37:00,563 --> 00:37:02,314
And I thought,

873
00:37:02,348 --> 00:37:04,316
this...

874
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:07,319
this is what a man looks like.

875
00:37:07,353 --> 00:37:10,389
This is how a man loves.

876
00:37:11,658 --> 00:37:13,275
But you...

877
00:37:13,326 --> 00:37:16,945
not telling me where you were
for four months

878
00:37:16,996 --> 00:37:18,276
and sneaking out before sunrise,

879
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,397
in the middle of the night,
without saying good-bye,

880
00:37:20,398 --> 00:37:22,233
that is not being a man, Finn.

881
00:37:22,251 --> 00:37:23,691
I'm trying to give you your freedom!

882
00:37:23,692 --> 00:37:25,252
I don't need you to give me my freedom!

883
00:37:25,253 --> 00:37:26,872
I am a grown woman.

884
00:37:26,906 --> 00:37:29,074
I don't need you to hide from me,

885
00:37:29,092 --> 00:37:31,076
to keep me from doing
what is right for me.

886
00:37:31,094 --> 00:37:32,377
Like that Brody guy?

887
00:37:32,411 --> 00:37:35,631
I didn't do Brody, okay?

888
00:37:35,682 --> 00:37:38,350
And don't you think that I would
have rather have been with you?

889
00:37:38,384 --> 00:37:40,636
Well, didn't you say he was on Broadway?

890
00:37:40,687 --> 00:37:42,727
Right? And he's got,
like, three-percent body fat.

891
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:43,472
Who am I?

892
00:37:43,523 --> 00:37:45,090
I barely even graduated high school,

893
00:37:45,108 --> 00:37:47,092
and my life has absolutely

894
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,827
no direction.

895
00:37:48,861 --> 00:37:50,646
Don't you get it?

896
00:37:50,697 --> 00:37:53,198
No matter how rich

897
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:56,318
or famous or successful I become,

898
00:37:56,369 --> 00:37:59,705
when it comes to you,

899
00:37:59,739 --> 00:38:02,824
I'm...

900
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:06,662
I'm always gonna be
that moon-eyed girl

901
00:38:06,713 --> 00:38:09,948
who freaked you out at
our first glee rehearsal.

902
00:38:11,617 --> 00:38:14,052
You were the first boy

903
00:38:14,087 --> 00:38:16,555
who made me feel loved

904
00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:19,224
and sexy

905
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:21,927
and visible.

906
00:38:23,813 --> 00:38:27,065
You are my first love.

907
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,135
And...

908
00:38:30,153 --> 00:38:34,606
I want, more than anything,

909
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,743
for you to be my last.

910
00:38:40,747 --> 00:38:43,749
But I can't do this anymore.

911
00:38:46,335 --> 00:38:48,336
At least, not now.

912
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:52,541
We're done.

913
00:38:52,592 --> 00:38:54,593
Wow.

914
00:38:57,597 --> 00:38:59,548
What am I gonna do with my life?

915
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,666
I don't have my girl, I don't have a job,

916
00:39:01,684 --> 00:39:03,935
I don't have a place in this world.

917
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:07,005
You have you.

918
00:39:08,808 --> 00:39:10,842
And that's better than
anyone else on the planet,

919
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,644
as far as I'm concerned.

920
00:39:18,484 --> 00:39:20,018
(kissing)

921
00:39:22,288 --> 00:39:24,289
(sighs)
