1
00:00:52,400 --> 00:01:00,600
The Swan Princess

2
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,000
Once upon a time,
There was a King named William.

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,800
Who ruled a large
and mighty Kingdom,

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,400
and yet he was sad.

5
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,400
He was growing old and had no
child to inherit the thrown.

6
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,200
Then happily, a daughter was born,

7
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,000
a Princess.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And she was given the name Odette.

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Kings and Queens came from all
around to offer the gifts to the child.

10
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,000
Among them was the widow Uberta

11
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,800
and her young son Prince Derek.

12
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,600
It was then that William and Uberta
had upon the same idea.

13
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Derek and Odette will be
brought together each summer,

14
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,000
in hopes that they will fall in love,

15
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,400
And join their Kingdoms forever.

16
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,000
But unknown to all was another plan,

17
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,600
that of the evil enchanter Rothbart.

18
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Odette birth was of little
concern to him,

19
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,400
for he was prepearing
to take William's Kingdom,

20
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,800
by means of the 'forbidden arts'.

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,400
On the eve of his assault,
William attacked

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and Rothbart's power
was plunged into darkness.

23
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,800
Despite calls for his death,
the enchanter was only banished.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,600
I'm not finnished with you yet, Willi.

25
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,000
Someday I'll get my power back,

26
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,400
and when I'll do,

27
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,400
everything you own,

28
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,400
everything you love,

29
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,600
will be mine!

30
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,800
Many feared King William too kind,

31
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,400
but in time, the threat was forgotten,

32
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
and all hopes turned to
that not so distant summer,

33
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,400
When Derek and Odette would meet.

34
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,200
Here they come.

35
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,000
Dear Uberta, and lovely as ever.

36
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, a nest.

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Ah, and who is this terrific
young man be?

38
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,400
Young prince Derek, no doubt.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,400
Welcome to our fair Kingdom dear
William, and to you, young Princess.

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,800
Go on, Derek!

41
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,400
Dear, go on!
-Mother! -Derek!

42
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,000
Hello Princess Odette,
I'm very pleased to meet you.

43
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,600
Pleased to meet you, Prince Derek.

44
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Ha-ha-ha-haa.

45
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,800
Yach.

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,120
I can’t believe I’m stuck
with her all summer,

47
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,200
I’ll bet, she doesn’t wrestle,
hunt or box.

48
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,720
He looks conceited,
What a total bummer.

49
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,560
If I get lucky, I’ll get chicken pox.

50
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,040
So happy you could come.

51
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,200
So happy to be here.

52
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,720
How I’d like to run.

53
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,320
This is not my idea.

54
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,600
This isn’t my idea,

55
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,600
Of fun.

56
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,720
The children seem to get
along quite nicely.

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,640
We’ll join our lands if
this arrangement clicks.

58
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,480
My dear King William,
that’s my point precisely.

59
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,960
It’s such good parenting

60
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,400
And politics.

61
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,280
So happy we agree.

62
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,800
I think we’ve got a deal.

63
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,400
Derek’s quite a catch.

64
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,200
This is my idea.

65
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,480
This is my idea,

66
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,440
Of a match.

67
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,000
They such naughty.

68
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,920
Good heavens, child, don’t dawdle,
We can’t keep Derek waiting.

69
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,200
I haven't packed or washed my hair
And father I get seasick.

70
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:57,080
She soon will be arriving,
Is that respect you're showing?

71
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,880
To make me kiss her hand again,
I swear I'm gonna be sick.

72
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,880
One day Prince Derek will
be her intended.

73
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,480
Splendid!

74
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,000
We've tried all summer,
but we just can't lose her.

75
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Hey fellas, wait up!

76
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,200
Quick, put on some speed.

77
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,920
When picking teams
Or friends,

78
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,800
I never choose her.

79
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,800
You'd think she'd take a hint?
a learn to read?

80
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,480
This really isn't fair.

81
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,320
We really couldn't care.

82
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,800
Boys, it's all or none.

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,400
This is not my idea.

84
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
This isn't my idea,

85
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Of fun.

86
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Long before they met,

87
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,600
Derek and Odette,

88
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,480
Were destined to be wedded.

89
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,960
However anyone could see,

90
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,400
The only point on which they
didn't disagree,

91
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,880
Was that the very thought
of summertime,

92
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,400
Was dreaded.

93
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,600
She tries to talk me
into playing dress-up,

94
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
She's always flirting
with the castle guards.

95
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,600
I think you really sorta
like her, 'fess up.

96
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,200
I'd like her better if she'd lose at cards,
-Four sevens and a ten.

97
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,000
I think I've won again.

98
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,200
Every time she's won.

99
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,360
This is my idea.

100
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
This isn't my idea,

101
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,600
Of fun.

102
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,400
We need a royal wedding.

103
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,800
I'd love to be invited.

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,600
At least we'd get a holiday,
to rest our ploughs and axes.

105
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,800
Someday these two will marry,

106
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,200
Two lands will be united,

107
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,600
And with some luck their marriage,
may result in lower taxes.

108
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,400
What if Odette doesn't go
for the merger?

109
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,080
Urge her!

110
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,000
For as long as I remember,
We've been told

111
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,400
we'd someday wed,
Every June until September.

112
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,920
All their pushing and
annoying hints.

113
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,000
I've got bruises with
their fingerprints.

114
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,400
I can do much better I am sure.

115
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,880
He's so immature.

116
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,400
I see him smiling
and my knees start buckling,

117
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,520
I see inside him
and my doubts are gone.

118
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,600
She started out as
such an ugly duckling,

119
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,600
And somehow suddenly
became a swan.

120
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,400
So happy to be here.

121
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,800
'Til now I never knew.

122
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,200
It is you I've been dreaming of.

123
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,600
This is my idea.

124
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
This is my idea.

125
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,400
What a good idea, such
a charming and romantic notion.

126
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,400
This is my idea.
-This is my idea.

127
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,400
Such a good idea.
-Such a good idea.

128
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,000
What a good idea,
such a powerful and magic potion.

129
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,000
This is exactly my idea,

130
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Of love.

131
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,400
This is my idea.

132
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,000
This is my idea.

133
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,600
This is my idea,

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,200
Of love.

135
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Arrange the marriage.

136
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Wait!

137
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
What?

138
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,800
You are all, I ever wanted.
You're beautiful.

139
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,000
Thank you, but what else?

140
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
What else?

141
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Is beauty all that matters to you?

142
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Derek!

143
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What else?

144
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,800
I... what else is there?
-Ahh.

145
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,400
We tried, Uberta.
No one can say, we didn't try.

146
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Say goodbye, Odette.

147
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,600
Good bye. -Good byeeee?
-Prince Derek.

148
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,400
Mother!
-Derek!

149
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,800
Good bye, Princess.

150
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,000
All these years of planning,
Waisted!

151
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,600
"What else is there"?

152
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,800
She says
"Is beauty all that matters"?

153
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,600
And you say "what else is there"?

154
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,000
It was dumb, I know.

155
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,600
You should write a book,

156
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,600
How to offend women in
five syllables or less.

157
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,400
Your turn, Prince Derek.

158
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,800
I did not know what else to say.

159
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,600
You lost your Queen, Derek.

160
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,600
It's twice in one day.

161
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,600
Think! You must see something
other than Odette's beauty.

162
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,600
Ha, Of course I do Rogers.

163
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,600
She's like... you know...

164
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,200
How about... and then,
I mean right?

165
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,400
I don't know how to say it.

166
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,400
I'll prove it to her.

167
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,800
I'll prove my love.

168
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,000
Checkmate!

169
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,200
Today is the day, Willy!

170
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,800
Everything you own!
Everything you love!

171
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,200
Will be mine!

172
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,200
I... I just don't understand.

173
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,400
What else did you want him to say?

174
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
I need to know that he loves me.

175
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,000
For just being me.

176
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,200
Stay inside, Odette.

177
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,000
It's King's William Captain.

178
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,000
We...
We were attacked.

179
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,400
A great animal...

180
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,400
Odette?

181
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,000
Derek! Wait!

182
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Odette!

183
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Odette?

184
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Odette!

185
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
King William.

186
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,000
Derek.

187
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
Who did it?

188
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,000
It came so quickly...

189
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
A great... animal.

190
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Where is Odette?

191
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,200
Listen to me, Derek.

192
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,800
It's not what it seems...

193
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
It's not what it seems...

194
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What's not?

195
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Where is Odette?

196
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,400
Odette, is...

197
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:45,400
Odette, is... gone.

198
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,800
Odette!

199
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,000
Don't let my little
spell make you sad, Odette.

200
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,800
It does not even
last the whole day.

201
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,600
As soon as the moon comes up...

202
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,400
And that's how it works,
every night.

203
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,400
You have to be on
the lake of course,

204
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,200
and when the moonlight
touches your wings...

205
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Look Odette.

206
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
This sort of thing does not
give me any pleasure.

207
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,600
Well, maybe a little bit...

208
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,000
But what I really want is...
is your father's Kingdom.

209
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
Take it than,
you have enough power.

210
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Naaa, tried that already.

211
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,000
Once you steal something,

212
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,400
you spend your whole life
fighting to keep it.

213
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,400
But... If I marry you...
and to the throne...

214
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,600
We'll rule your father's Kingdom
together, legally.

215
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,400
King and Queen.

216
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,400
You know...
-Never!

217
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Where are you going?

218
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,800
As soon as moonlight leaves the
lake, You turn back into the swan.

219
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,400
No matter where you are.

220
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,200
The musicians are not happy.

221
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,200
I know, but I have to practice.

222
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,000
No, no complains here.

223
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,400
I think, it's going to be lots of fun.

224
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,400
The Great animal's never going
to give up without a fight.

225
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,000
You are still thinking,
she is alive?

226
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,600
When I'll find the Great animal,
 Rogers, I'll find Odette.

227
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,200
Oh, Derek,
You looked everywhere.

228
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
She is not coming back.

229
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,600
The whole Kingdom knows that.

230
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
The whole Kingdom is wrong

231
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Odette's alive.

232
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,200
And I get to find her.

233
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
You ready, Brom?
-No peeking!

234
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Animals! Assemble!

235
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,800
Lord Rogers, I must object.
We are musicians.

236
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,000
The servants have the day off.
We have to use someone.

237
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,800
But I am an artist, not a boar.

238
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,800
Could've fooled me.

239
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,000
Come on, guys.
They harmless.

240
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,400
We are a band,
And not a band of animals.

241
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,000
This masquerade,
Is more than I can bear.

242
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,000
There goes my reputation,
It's awful, this humiliation.

243
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,000
And I've the lion's share.

244
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,000
Down on all fours, please
and growl ferociously.

245
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,000
Liven it up a bit!

246
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,200
I want you to strike fear into my heart.

247
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,000
Not You, Wesley, you're a rabbit,

248
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,200
For heaven's sake.

249
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:43,400
Archers!  Ready!  Set! Go!

250
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Duck!
Yes!

251
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Duck!
What?

252
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,600
Day after day all the prince ever does,

253
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,000
Is practice, practice, practice.

254
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,400
Thinking of her
and the way that it was.

255
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,400
Practice, practice, practice.

256
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,000
He's not happy, 'til he has attacked us.

257
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,600
Twelve seconds.

258
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,200
Day after day all the prince ever does.

259
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Is practice, practice, practice.

260
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,800
Thinking of her
and the way that it was.

261
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,400
Practice, practice, practice.

262
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,200
If we refused he would have
sacked us. -Five seconds.

263
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,800
So we face a life of target.
Three, Two.

264
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,800
Practice, practice, practice.

265
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,280
Time's up!

266
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,200
Animals, assemble for counting.

267
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
Ha-ha, very good, very good.

268
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,000
Your scored, thank you, five pointers.

269
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,600
That's for sure.

270
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,000
Sorry Hans, why don't
you take few days off.

271
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,000
Moose are worth 2 points.

272
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,200
Sixteen Hits a total of 32.

273
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,200
Ten 7 points.

274
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,600
And... Fourteen 3 Points.

275
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,400
A total of 298.

276
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,200
Well done! Derek.

277
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Now, Bromley, let's see if you...

278
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,200
Hmm... zero and zero and
a nothing and nil and zip.

279
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,200
And last but not least,
the elusive one hundred points.

280
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,400
White rabbit.

281
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,800
I belive that's
three hundreds Rogers.

282
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Good shooting Brom.

283
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,200
Well what it tell?

284
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,400
300 into 298.

285
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,400
Oh, but a wait just
a moment Rogers.

286
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,600
Sorry Brom.

287
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,800
Ha-ha-ha-hmm.

288
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,200
You are a great archer,
one of the best.

289
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,200
But it's gets more
than good aim,

290
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,600
in types courage,
thats why they for there.

291
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,200
Well, then how about quick
round of catch and fire.

292
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,000
Ca-Ca-Ca-Catch and fire.
You mean me.

293
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,200
You are the only one with enough,
Co-Co-Co-Courage.

294
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,400
Whoooo ho.
Are you sure you are alright?

295
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,400
Hmm quiet I'm I'm fine.

296
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,600
Ho-hooo. Too tied, too tied.

297
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,000
Whoops, so sorry...

298
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,400
Ready? -He is ready.

299
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,600
Remember now, aim to the heart.

300
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,400
Right between the shoulders.

301
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,200
Oh please, so please.

302
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,000
Come on, Brom, hold it steady.

303
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,200
Oh please, oh please, oh please.

304
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
Now!

305
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Fifty two out of fifty two.

306
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,800
Well done, Derek.

307
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,000
Extraordinary couragement,

308
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,200
Just think, one inch lower.

309
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,800
And that arrow would have...

310
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,400
Don't loose hope, Odette,
Wherever you are,

311
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
I'm going to find you.

312
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,200
Quiet, I can not concentrate.

313
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,200
You've come up with
some dumb ideas Jean Bob.

314
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,200
But this one is a dozy.

315
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Go ahead and laugh.

316
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,400
I'll get her to kiss me
and when she does...

317
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,200
And when she does...
poof, you'll change into a prince.

318
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,600
I know, I know, you've told me.

319
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,000
Why don't you just give her
these flowers?

320
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,800
These are pretty.

321
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,800
Ahh, what a love dance,

322
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,800
I don't want these flowers,

323
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,400
I must of those.

324
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,600
When she learns that I have

325
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,600
risked my life for them,

326
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,200
then her kissing will not stop.

327
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,800
And then you'll change into a prince.

328
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,800
Precisely.

329
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Mind if I point up a problem.

330
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,600
I don't take advise from peasants.

331
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,000
Suit yourself.

332
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,000
Flower, Kiss, concentration.

333
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,000
Flower, Kiss, concentration.

334
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,000
Just curious,
how you gonna get back?

335
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
Hurry! Hurry!

336
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,200
Move up! Move up!
Faster! Claude.

337
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,200
Grab me, grab me.

338
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
Hold my arm, hold my leg.

339
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,200
Hold my...
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

340
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,200
Oh, thank you Odette.

341
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,800
Thank you, let me have that.

342
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,200
Silence! you savages.

343
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,800
Oh, Are you alright Jean Bob?

344
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,200
Jean Bob?

345
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,000
Oui, Oui.

346
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
Oui, Odette, yes, I am alright.

347
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
What the whole world,
do you tring to do.

348
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,000
He thought that if...
-shosh...

349
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,400
I wanted to get those flowers for you.

350
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,600
You are being sneaky
again, Jean Bob!

351
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,200
What sneaky?
You deserve it, not? OK?

352
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,200
And you deserve a kiss?

353
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,600
Well, alright.

354
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,400
You know that, I am under a spell.

355
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,800
But my kiss will break the spell.

356
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,400
Give it up Jean Bob.

357
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,200
I can only kiss the man I love
And then he...

358
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,600
Must make a vow of
everlasting love I know.

359
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,000
And prove it to the world.

360
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,000
What do you think,
I was doing with the flowers,

361
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,600
in the alligators going jam jam?

362
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,200
Speed, make him understand.

363
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,800
I am only a turtle.

364
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
If I could break this spell,
I'd run to him today.

365
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,000
And somehow I know
he's on his way to me.

366
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:45,400
Derek, you and I were meant to be.

367
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,400
Far longer than forever.

368
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,800
I'll hold you in my heart.

369
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,600
It's almost like you're here with me.

370
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,200
Although we're far apart.

371
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,000
Far longer than forever.

372
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,800
As constant as a star.

373
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:19,200
I close my eyes and
I am where you are.

374
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,200
Sure as the dawn brings the sunrise.

375
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,800
We've an unshakable bond.

376
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,400
Destined to last for
a lifetime and beyond.

377
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,600
Far longer than forever.
-Far longer than forever.

378
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:42,200
I swear that I'll be true.
-I swear that I'll be true.

379
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,600
I've made an everlasting vow.

380
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,800
To find a way to you.

381
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,800
Far longer than forever.

382
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,800
Like no love every known.

383
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:08,800
And with your love
I'll never be alone.

384
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,200
Far longer than forever.

385
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,800
Much stronger than forever.

386
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:33,600
And with your love
I'll never be alone.

387
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,800
You think, he is dead?

388
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,000
No, it just his wing, I think.

389
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,800
Strange looking bird.

390
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,600
Uhhhh...

391
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,800
Uh my, fellow, you must
be in a lot of pain.

392
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,200
You better hold him.

393
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,000
Uh...
-Ready.

394
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,600
Uhhhh... hhha.

395
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,400
Hello!

396
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,600
This is your wake up time.

397
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
It takes more than a pair of
dumb fools to keep Puffin down.

398
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,800
Wait! Wait!

399
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,400
I-I am your friend.

400
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,800
If you are my friend, how come
you have an arrow in you hand?

401
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,800
Haa? Haa? Yes!

402
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
The exact arrow I have?
Hmm... Haaa.

403
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,600
I took it out when you
were laying there.

404
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,600
You mean, you had a chance to...
kill... but still you free...

405
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,600
Ahaa.

406
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,400
Madam, I apologise.

407
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,600
My name is Puffin.

408
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,800
Lieutenant Puffin.

409
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
It's a pleasure, Lieutenant Puffin.

410
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,400
I'm Odette,

411
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,600
Princess Odette.

412
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,800
And these are my best friends
in the whole world.

413
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,400
Mr. Lorenzo Trudge-Along.

414
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,600
Friends call me speed.
-And Jean Bob.

415
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,600
I have no friends,
only servants

416
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,400
and zey call me, "Your Highness".

417
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,400
He thinks, he is a Prince.

418
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
I owe you, princess,

419
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,200
And I intend on staying
until we get his paid.

420
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,200
I don't think there is much you can do.

421
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,400
He has my under a spell.

422
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,600
What! You mean a magical who...
who-ho-ho-ho.

423
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,000
Your Knight in shining armor,
has come to set you free!

424
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,200
Let me ask him,
let me ask him...

425
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Enough... enough.

426
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
All it takes is just one little word.

427
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,400
Will you... marry me?

428
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
Every night you ask
the same question.

429
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,400
No! No!

430
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,200
And every night I give
you the same answer.

431
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:53,800
Don't!

432
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
I'll die first.

433
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,400
Really start to bug me.

434
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,400
I think, you be used
to it by now.

435
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,000
Thats it!
Yours kept push it!

436
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,600
But some day I'm gonna boil over!

437
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,600
Go head then!

438
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
But I'll never give you
my fathers Kingdom!

439
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,000
I knew it.

440
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,200
I was hoping,
you would say "You'll be mine".

441
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,200
Well, it looks as
if you need another day.

442
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
Just think about it.

443
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
No!

444
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Princess!

445
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,200
Beautiful! Simply beautiful!

446
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,000
Soon Derek will be married,

447
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,000
And the Kingdom will
have a King again.

448
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,800
I doubt it.

449
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,200
Derek still refuses to be King,

450
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,600
Unless he finds Odette.

451
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,200
Oh... puppy pup, All that will
change at tomorrow nights ball.

452
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,000
They all coming to the ball.

453
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,000
Every princess is coming.

454
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,600
Oh my... Oh good... Oh my...
this is wonderful.

455
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,600
You see, Rogers?

456
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,200
One of these is bound
to change his mind.

457
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,200
Oh! Absolutely... Not!

458
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,200
Do not loosed one!

459
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,800
Oh no, no, no, no.

460
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,800
Where is Derek? Oh, never mind,
I know where he is.

461
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,400
Working on the mystery
of the fat animal.

462
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,000
The great animal, Your Highness.

463
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,000
Oh, make great it's much better.

464
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,400
Listen, Derek, its not what it seems.

465
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,400
What did King William mean?

466
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,600
It's not what it seems.

467
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
Of course.

468
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,600
It's not what it seems.

469
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,000
Now I'll find you, Odette.

470
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,800
They are comming, Derek.

471
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,200
Oh, where Odette?

472
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
Where are you going?

473
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,000
To find the great animal.

474
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,000
Oh! wonderful.

475
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Just make sure,
you are here tomorrow night.

476
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,400
Tomorrow night?

477
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
The ball...

478
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,600
Mother, I... I can't.

479
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,600
Please mother,
don't do the lip thing.

480
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
If I leave now,

481
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,800
May be, I can be back in time.

482
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,000
Oh, Thank you darling.

483
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,200
Please mother, don't turn it
into one of your beauty pageants.

484
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,400
Hooo... no no no no no,
It just a few friends

485
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
And their daughters.

486
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,800
I want this to be big.

487
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,600
Every princess that
ever own production.

488
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,800
But You said...

489
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,600
Forget what I said.

490
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,600
Now, send for the cooks

491
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,400
And tell the band
to start rehearsing

492
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,600
And I want four footmen
for every carriage.

493
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,600
Make it five.

494
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,800
Let me get this straight.
You mean...

495
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,800
Every night when the
moonlight leaves the lake,

496
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,800
You...

497
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,000
Right.

498
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,200
The following night,
if I wanted turn back into a human,

499
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,000
I have to be on the lake.

500
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,200
What she needs
is a little moon light.

501
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,000
Me, I after be smooched.

502
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,800
No fear!

503
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,800
You fly to your prince.

504
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,400
We bring him back to the lake.

505
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,200
The moon comes up.

506
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,800
You change into a princess.

507
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,000
And... happily ever after.

508
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
How am I find him?

509
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,200
You don't know where he is?

510
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,600
I even don't know where I am.

511
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,800
I bet, he does.

512
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,800
Oh, such a great idea.

513
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,600
Just say "Monsieur Rothbart",

514
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,400
I'd like to leave now,
you have a map or something.

515
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,800
That's it!

516
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,200
A map!

517
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Let's do it!

518
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,600
We’re off on a mission.

519
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,200
We’re tough, in good condition.

520
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,160
We're short.

521
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,600
But standing tall.
No fear!

522
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,800
There's danger around us.

523
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,400
They'd hurt us if they found us.

524
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,760
Our backs are to the wall.

525
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,760
No fear!

526
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,600
‘Cause we have all
the courage we require.

527
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,400
Take it from a frequent flyer.

528
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,760
Try your luck.

529
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,200
Our plan will fly.

530
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
No fear!

531
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
It's hanging on the wall.

532
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
In the upper chamber.

533
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,960
Odette will keep looking after him,

534
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
While we get the map.

535
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,200
We?

536
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,800
Would you not go to help us?

537
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,800
Oui.

538
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,800
This plan if applied’ll.

539
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,200
Be simply suicidal.

540
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,560
You’ll be a sitting duck.

541
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
No fear!

542
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,800
Suppose that I do this.

543
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,400
Who knows if
we’ll live through this?

544
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
How ‘bout a kiss for luck?

545
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
No,
-Fear!

546
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Our team is shy one green,
web-footed volunteer.

547
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,760
No way, Jose.

548
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,560
No chance!

549
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,560
No choice.

550
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,360
No fear!

551
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,600
No! stop it! stop it! No!

552
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
Alright! Quickly!

553
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,200
Easy for you to say.

554
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
Ahooch...

555
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,400
Why ever I have to do something?
Quick!

556
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,600
I always bring a turtle.

557
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,000
I think I pull a muscle.

558
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,360
I'm gonna die!

559
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,400
Out of it, I am going a dangerous
mission with a labor turtle!

560
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,400
You're gonna get us, all kill.

561
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,000
Be careful.

562
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,600
We will take any dare that the
other side’ll dare to dream up.

563
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,560
We’ll fight tough we’ll play fair.

564
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,000
But we’re sure to win
because we’ll team up.

565
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,600
Yaahics...

566
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,400
Hit for the door.

567
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,600
Alright! Jean bob go speed,
Speed gets the hands off.

568
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Ready!
-Ready.

569
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,600
Set!

570
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,400
I'm open, I'm open.

571
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
What?

572
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,400
Catch that map.

573
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,800
Saved you.

574
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,800
Reach.

575
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,400
Hey! better better bet.

576
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,400
All The crowd...

577
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,400
No fear!

578
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,200
She’s gaining!
She’s faster!

579
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
We’re heading for disaster!

580
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,800
Our hero, warts and all!

581
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,600
No fear!

582
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,160
I would be fine if
one of us knew how to steer!

583
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,960
Get a grip!

584
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,760
Get set.

585
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,160
That’s our respect!

586
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,960
No breaks!

587
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,960
No sweat.

588
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,360
And no regrets!

589
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:12,960
We’re dead!

590
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,960
Not yet.

591
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,600
Oh no, not there!

592
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,600
Save me.

593
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
No fear!

594
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,800
There is Derek's Kingdom.

595
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,200
When do we leave?

596
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,800
It's a mouse.

597
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,600
A great animal.

598
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,000
That's small one, I'd say.

599
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,600
Yeah, Until it changes into this...

600
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
An animal that can change it's shape.

601
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,000
A harmless creature approaches.

602
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,800
Then, suddenly it's too late.

603
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,000
You mean, you mean it
could be anything?

604
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,800
Anything.

605
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,800
Odette, I appologise for
the way I have been acting.

606
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,600
It's alright Jean Bob.

607
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,800
No, no, this Derek is
very important to you.

608
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,600
And all I can do, is think of myself.

609
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,400
Every one does that.

610
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,800
Please, Odette, don't make it
more difficult, than it all ready is.

611
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,800
Accept my appology, please.

612
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,000
OK, I accept.

613
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,800
Good, now we can kiss and make up.

614
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,200
Jean Bob!

615
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,000
What did I say, what? What?

616
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,400
The thing...

617
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,000
It is "zero hour", troops.

618
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,400
Odette, prepare for take off.

619
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,400
Right.

620
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,600
The rest,
do you have your assignments?

621
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,200
Is everyone ready?

622
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,400
Ready for action, sir.

623
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,000
How about you, Jean Bob?

624
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,800
Jean Bob!

625
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,600
... Highness.

626
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,400
Oui, I am... ready.

627
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,600
Take off!

628
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,400
Good luck.

629
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,200
Have a nice flight.

630
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,600
Remember!
If anything happens to her,

631
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,200
I'll have you
whipped, flogged, put on ze rack

632
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,400
and your back legs
fried in butter.

633
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,800
He is in here, Brom.

634
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,400
I can feel it.

635
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,800
Oh, You know the great animal,
when you see it...

636
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Oh, no.

637
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
Better stay close.

638
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,200
If you say so.

639
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,400
Derek... Derek!
Where are you?

640
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,200
Shh... shh...

641
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,600
Oh, sorry.

642
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,200
Derek?

643
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,400
Derek!

644
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,600
We'll better keep an eye for hunters.

645
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:47,000
Ease Odette,
I can smell a human, a mile away.

646
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,600
Would a duck.

647
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
Derek!

648
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,000
He is here!

649
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,600
What the... You will not lose control!

650
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
You will follow the plan.

651
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,800
Its our line.

652
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,200
Acknowledge, acknowle...

653
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,200
Odette!

654
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,600
Odette?

655
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,800
No! I've got you now! Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh.

656
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,400
Don't give with that innocent look.

657
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,400
Oh-Oh, charge!

658
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,800
Go a head, charge!

659
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,600
No, I am not afraid of you!

660
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,200
Twit! Nooooo...

661
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,800
Ahh, Derek!

662
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,200
A Swan?

663
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,200
A Swan!

664
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,800
Of course!

665
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,600
It's not what it seems.

666
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,200
Just a little closer.

667
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,600
Come on!
Come on!

668
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,600
Derek...

669
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,400
This one is for Odette!

670
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,800
Uhh, look out!

671
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,600
Uhh, Uhh, Uhh, that was close.

672
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,000
Ha Ha, It's working,
here he comes.

673
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,800
Hey, slow down,
you're going to lose him.

674
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,800
Slowww dowww.

675
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,400
He is too close.
-Too close?

676
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,400
He can't even see us
any more. let's...

677
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,200
Stay up now.

678
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,200
Ho, your boy know how to move.
-I told you.

679
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,400
He is faster than you thought.

680
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,000
Don't worry, Odette.

681
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,400
I even thought, just what
to do in this situation.

682
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,200
Well?
-When... -Puffin!

683
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
When you're too isolated.

684
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,800
Fly into the sun and use
it's light. Follow me.

685
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Ha ha! Well, what did
I tell you Odette?

686
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,800
Yes, now you see! all we have
to do is just stay in. So?

687
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,200
Ha, Alright!
Don't panic! Don't panic!

688
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,200
Puffin! -Odette, hurry.
-Into the trees!

689
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,600
You'll better think
of something quick.

690
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,000
Or else, we're "The Ducks".

691
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,800
How about, shooting the
number that poison, said?

692
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
When there's no escape.

693
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,600
You have to play dead.

694
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,200
It give you the right touch.

695
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,400
Wait till I get, give up. Ha.

696
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,800
That will put some
distance between us.

697
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,800
No sign of them yet.

698
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,600
I hope that Pigeon, Puffin,
knows what he is doing.

699
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,200
Incoming.

700
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,400
Ha, ha, there they are.

701
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,000
It's almost time, Odette. Look!

702
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,400
I... I cant do it.
-But you have to.

703
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,800
He'll kill me, Puffin!

704
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,800
You don't do it now, Odette,
You've lost your chance for life.

705
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,800
Alright.

706
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,800
I'll do it.
-Go!

707
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,400
What?

708
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,600
Alright! Come on! Come on!

709
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,800
Got you!

710
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Hello Derek.

711
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,600
Derek, I missed you so.

712
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,400
No one believed me.

713
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,800
But I knew...
-You can't stay.

714
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,200
Can't stay?

715
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
No, I'll never let you
out of my sight again.

716
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,200
Listen to me, Derek.

717
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,600
Odette!
-Oh, no!

718
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,600
Who is it? What's going on?

719
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,800
It's him! -Who?

720
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,600
He has me under a spell.

721
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,400
Who does?
Odette!

722
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,200
Let him come! I'm...

723
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,000
No! He has great power.

724
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,200
You must go!

725
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,600
You are coming with me.

726
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,800
I can't.

727
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,200
When the moon sets,
I turn back into a swan.

728
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,600
Please Derek,
you have to trust me.

729
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,000
Go!

730
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,200
There must be someway
to break the spell.

731
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,200
Oh, there is.

732
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,400
You must make a vow
of everlasting love.

733
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,400
I'll make it.
It's all I ever wanted.

734
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,200
You must prove it to the world.

735
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,000
How? How?

736
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,000
I don't know...
-Odette!

737
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,800
Go!

738
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,800
The ball! Tomorrow night.
Come to the castle.

739
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,800
Before the whole world,
I will make a vow.

740
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,200
Of everlasting love.

741
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,400
Odette!

742
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,200
I'm coming.

743
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,600
Go!
-Tomorrow night.

744
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,800
Yes, tomorrow night.

745
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,400
Go.

746
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,200
Odette!

747
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,000
Didn't you hear me calling?

748
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,400
I... I... I...

749
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,800
I thought, I heared voices?

750
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,800
Odette, Odette.

751
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,200
Voices?
-Yes. Voices!

752
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,600
Well, I...
-You what?

753
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,000
I decided to become your Queen.

754
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,200
No! You mean...
Oh! Odette...

755
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,000
Odette, you make me so happy
I'll be a good King. You'll see.

756
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,600
I'll wear nice clothes
and I'm going to clip my beard.

757
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,400
Shit, Oh... you...
you made me so happy.

758
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,400
Oh, by the way!

759
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,000
You would't happen to know,
what's this belongs to?

760
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,000
Would you?

761
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,200
"Come to the ball, I will make a vow".

762
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,400
"An everlasting love"!

763
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,000
Thought, you could fool Rothbart?

764
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,600
Did you?

765
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,600
I will never be yours!
You creature!

766
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,800
I will marry Prince Derek,
and you can not stop me!

767
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I hate to tell you this, Odette.

768
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,800
But you wan't be able to attend
the big ball tomorrow night.

769
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,200
If you want to stop me,
you'll have to kill me!

770
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,800
No! I don't think so.

771
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,000
You see, you forgot one
very important thing.

772
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,000
Tomorrow night... there is no moon.

773
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:29,200
No matter what they do,
I always one step ahead.

774
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,600
On the other hand, Prince Derek's
vow could ruin everything.

775
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,600
I'll gonna have to deal with him.

776
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,800
But how?

777
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,600
I am going to turn his
vow to the wrong princess.

778
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,200
That's it.

779
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I'll make you look like Odette.

780
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,800
That's gonna take a lot of work.

781
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
But it will be worth it.

782
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,600
Because when he makes his
vow to the wrong girl,

783
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,400
Odette will die!

784
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,800
And I'll finish Derek off myself.

785
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,000
Oh, I love it.

786
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,200
I mean, this is really classic.

787
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,800
This is me!

788
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,400
Gosh, it's such a hoot
to see them quaking.

789
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,600
When I'm King they'll
treat me with respect.

790
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,800
I can't wait to watch
their poor hearts breaking.

791
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,400
So much for politically correct.

792
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,400
Up 'til now I've pulled my punches.

793
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I intend to eat their lunches.

794
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,200
No more Mr. Nice Guy, not for me.

795
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,400
If you think that I'm hard-hearted.

796
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,200
Well, let me by,
I haven't even started.

797
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,400
No more Mr. Nice Guy, no siree.

798
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,200
Soon as my witchcraft
has zinged them.

799
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,000
I'll gain control of the Kingdom.

800
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,200
As for Odette, well that's tragic.

801
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,000
'Cause I'm going back
to that old black magic.

802
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,600
Good behaviour is so much duller.

803
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,600
Time to show my one true colour.

804
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,800
Baby, Mr. Nice Guy's history.

805
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,200
Vengeance is what I believe in.

806
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,200
I don't get mad, I get even.

807
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,200
Odette can't get to the ball
'cause I won't bring her.

808
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,400
So I'll zap up a date
who's a real dead ringer.

809
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,400
Up to no good, I love plottin'.

810
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,200
'Cause I'm so good when I'm rotten.

811
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:58,800
No more Mr. Nice Guy,
wait and see. -wait and see.

812
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,800
I'll become that nasty,
naughty, very spiteful.

813
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,600
Wicked, wayward, way delightful.

814
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:11,000
Bad guy I was born to be.

815
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,000
One more time.

816
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,800
Lying, loathsame, never tender.

817
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,200
Indiscreet repeat offender.

818
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,800
No more Mr. Nice Guy, that's not me.

819
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,800
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

820
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,600
Mother, have you seen...
Hello Derek.

821
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,800
What are these?
-Roses.

822
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,000
Red.
-Of course they're red.

823
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,400
But maam...I don't want red roses.

824
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,600
I want white, like a swan.
You seen Bromley? -No.

825
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,000
Has anyone seen Bromley?

826
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,000
Woul'd you feed this to a swan?

827
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,400
I...

828
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,400
Take it back.

829
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,800
Something light.
Something fresh.

830
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,800
No no no no no, Rogers, hold it.

831
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,200
Whats wrong?

832
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,800
Tonight the music must
be played... Rubato.

833
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,000
Soft and graceful...
like a swan.

834
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,400
A swan?
-You ever seen a swan, Rogers?

835
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,200
Of course I seen a swan!

836
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,000
If you could play a swan,
what would it sound like?

837
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,000
Soft and graceful, Rogers.

838
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,000
Where is Bromley?
No one has seen him, Derek.

839
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,600
You kidding. Who is
gonna be my best man?

840
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:46,600
Best... You mean... You...
Oh Derek, Ohhh Derek.

841
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
There you go Rogers,
thats the style.

842
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,400
Came on, Mother.

843
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,800
Oh, don't be so secretive, Derek.

844
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,200
Tell me, who she is?

845
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
It hurts me to lock
you up, Odette.

846
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,400
Hurts me... deep.

847
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:19,000
But then, a King this day
is full of tough decisions.

848
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,600
You understand?

849
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:25,800
Oh, now you mad at me
again, damn. Got it!

850
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:30,200
I can't do nothing right.
Head full of put on. Thats me.

851
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,200
Well, I can't leave you like this.

852
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,000
If you not happy,
I'm not happy.

853
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,000
I know. If you can't
attend the ball,

854
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,000
than I'll bring the ball to you.

855
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,800
Let see. The first thing,
you need is, a young man.

856
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,200
The Prince is busy of course, but...

857
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,400
I think, I can arrange
a substitution.

858
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,800
No, please,
I beg you, please.

859
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,600
Ohh, Poor fellow.
He got lost in the woods.

860
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:13,000
Oh, help... help!
Don't go.

861
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,600
I love to stay but if I don't leave
now, I'll be late. That's that.

862
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,200
Don't give me that look, you see.

863
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,400
Had to be sneaky.
Didn't you.

864
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,600
Had to drag your weakling
Prince into. Didn't you.

865
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
It's fine with me.
Just fine with me!

866
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,200
Every single princess
on the planet.

867
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,200
Prayed to be invited to the ball.

868
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,000
Every Portia, Guinevere and Janet.

869
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,000
Would come by coach
or boat to be here.

870
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,400
Most would swim the
moat to be here.

871
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,600
Just to be at this
historic gala.

872
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:28,000
Girls would walk around
or even crawl.

873
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:32,800
Rumour is that at this
joyous scene tonight.

874
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,600
The prince will likely choose
his future Queen tonight.

875
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,600
Excuse me.

876
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,200
Oh, excuse me.

877
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,600
Excuse me, Your Highness.

878
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,400
Yes, yes, Chamberlain.

879
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,600
Its getting rather crowded.

880
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,800
Very well, you may begin
the introductions.

881
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,800
And Chamberlain...
-Yes...

882
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
No mistakes this time.

883
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,600
Every thing must be perfect.

884
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,800
Oh, oh no no, oh yes,
I mean, oh no no, Madam.

885
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,200
Everything will be perfect.

886
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:16,400
Promise me, Derek, you'll tell me
who it is the moment she arrives.

887
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Don't worry, mother.

888
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,800
You'll know. Believe me.
You'll know.

889
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,200
Ah! -What?
-It comes.

890
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,600
What is...
-An idea!

891
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,200
A substantial idea.
A large colossal idea.

892
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,000
Sounds big.
-I've got it.

893
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,600
Water leaks into the dungeon.
Right?

894
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,600
Well, if there's a leak,
there must be a hole.

895
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,000
We'll find the hole, make it
bigger, and... she is loose.

896
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,600
I think, you forgetting two things.

897
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,600
His majesty has got a point.

898
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Not to worry!

899
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,200
Now, first we need a scout.

900
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,600
Are you crazy?

901
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,000
Who's going to jump into this moat?

902
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,800
He's got to be a good swimmer.

903
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I should say so.

904
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,200
He's got to be small too.

905
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,000
Tinny winny. Not to be seen.

906
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,200
And it wouldn't hurt if he was
green for camouflage purposes.

907
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,600
Precisely.
Small, good swimmer, Green.

908
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,000
Good grief, you talking about me?

909
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,000
You’re off on a mission.
-Not, definetly not!

910
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,600
You’re tough, in good condition.
-I can't hear you.

911
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,000
Our hero, warts and all!
-I can't hear you.

912
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,600
No fear!
-I can't hear you.

913
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,000
Thank you, oh thank you, now...

914
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,800
I know that some of you
jest at all beauty pageants.

915
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,800
But I have been a past past
girl myself win back in 39.

916
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,200
I just couldn't resist, girls,

917
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,400
and one, a two, a one two three.

918
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,200
Beauty and glamour
and breeding unmatched.

919
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,200
Princess is on parade.

920
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:04,400
Lovely, enthralling
and all unattached.

921
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,200
The hoi polloi and
those well-bred agree.

922
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,000
Each enjoy a royal pedigree.

923
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,000
Born for success,
each possesses a spark.

924
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:17,600
Each a remarkable maid.

925
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Boy, oh boy,
these royal highnesses.

926
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,400
Those all have pluses,
they've no minuses.

927
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,000
Gaze upon.

928
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:30,800
Princess is on parade.

929
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
This princess
comes from Caulchester.

930
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,000
Where corn and cotton grows.

931
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,400
She plays crockey
and art supports

932
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,400
and sews her own clothes.

933
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:43,600
Antonia isn't known to take
the part of least resistance.

934
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:48,000
She held from southeast Pakistan
and came the farther distance.

935
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,400
Grizelle lives to help the world.

936
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,400
She finds no task to anyone.

937
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:56,800
and all the other hopeful girls,
think she is the most con genuine.

938
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,400
Brunhelda is from Shtutgart
where swords and armour maid.

939
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,200
Gaze upon.

940
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:10,000
Princess is on parade.

941
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,200
This is the likely occasion,

942
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:18,000
When the heir to
the throne picks a wife.

943
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:23,200
This is may be the day
when Prince Derek will say.

944
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:27,600
“Where have you been all my life?"

945
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,200
Brilliant, beguiling,
the smiling brigade.

946
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:40,000
Princess is on parade.

947
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,200
Each the pride of her community.

948
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,000
Each a golden opportunity.

949
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,000
Just the thought
that crown Prince Derek'll.

950
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,800
Face his choice and he's hysterical.

951
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,600
Gaze upon.

952
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,800
Heap praise upon.

953
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,400
he is bigger, glamorous,
luminous, dazzling.

954
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:09,200
Princess is on Parade.

955
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,600
Chamberline.

956
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:23,800
Oh, who are invited
are present? are they not?

957
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,800
Well, yes, I mean... well...

958
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,800
Open the door!

959
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,800
Chamberlain.

960
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,000
Possibly it can't, my list...

961
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,000
This the milkman...
it must be the milkman.

962
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,200
Well, it's not the milkman.

963
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,200
Oh, oh no, it can't be...

964
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:07,000
Excusse me, pardon me, please,
please, I've got to get through here.

965
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,800
Oh,oh yes, she is lovely.
Isn't? hmm...

966
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,600
Queen coming through here,
excuse me, excuse me.

967
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,800
Rogers, Rogers! Who is it?

968
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,200
Do you know her?

969
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,600
I don't know.

970
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,600
Come on, Rogers, I know he
confides in you, who is it?

971
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,400
I promise,
I've never seen her before.

972
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,400
Although she does look
a great deal, like...

973
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,000
It couldn't be...

974
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,200
Could it?

975
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,600
Oh, I was so worried.
I almost thought.

976
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,200
Nothing keep me away.

977
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,400
OK. Speed will draw
the alligators away.

978
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,200
Then you'll get wind and start

979
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,200
and pick up... for that hole.

980
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:02,400
If I can find it and if the
alligators don't chew me.

981
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:03,400
Before I get there.

982
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,000
They can't worry.

983
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,000
Speed will rush to help.

984
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:11,400
Ah, Yes Mister!
Oh, lassies will rush to help.

985
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,000
That's the plan.

986
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,800
Suddenly I'm full of comfort.

987
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,600
Than alright. Stretch out.

988
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,800
How do I get myself
talk into this?

989
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:24,000
Oh, it's alright, use your mark.

990
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,800
Hey, you all leather hands.

991
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,200
Come and get me.

992
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,600
Come on Bug eyes.

993
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Ah ah, perfect, perfect, Right.

994
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,600
Ready! Get set! Go!

995
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,200
Faster! Faster!

996
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,200
Sure, go on Jean Bob,
right to your death.

997
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Get moving, slowpoke!

998
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,600
Slowpoke?

999
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,600
Na na, na na, na na, na na.

1000
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,600
Any luck?

1001
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Jean Bob?

1002
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,000
To the rescue, Mademoiselle.

1003
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
There's the signal.

1004
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:46,000
Alright, Puffin. Time
to brush up on a diving technic.

1005
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,000
You ho!
Those turtles are tough eaten.

1006
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,000
How about a good white meat?

1007
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,200
Good for the heart.

1008
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,200
We broke through!
Let's go!

1009
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,800
Thank you Jean Bob.

1010
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,600
Oh, and when this is over,
remind me to give you a kiss.

1011
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,200
What? What is it?

1012
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,000
Stay away! What are you doing?

1013
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,800
No! No! Go away!

1014
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,800
I'll tell you when.

1015
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Let's go!

1016
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,400
Friends call me speed.

1017
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,000
Go Odette! Go!

1018
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:14,200
Something about you, seems...
I don't know... different.

1019
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:20,400
Don't worry, after tonight
everything will be perfect.

1020
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,200
Yes, yes of course.

1021
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,200
Rogers, I want to make
an announcement.

1022
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,400
Stop the music!

1023
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:01,600
Kings and Queens,
ladies and gentelmen, mother.

1024
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,400
I have an announcement to make.

1025
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,200
Today I have found my bride.

1026
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,200
No Derek! No! It is a trick!

1027
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:17,800
Presenting to you as the
future Queen of our Kingdom.

1028
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,600
And as proof of my love for her,

1029
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,600
I make a vow to break all vows.

1030
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:32,600
A vow stronger than all
the powers of the earth.

1031
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,800
Before you and before
the whole world,

1032
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,800
I make a vow of
everlasting love.

1033
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,200
Derek!

1034
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,200
To Odette.

1035
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Noooooo!

1036
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:18,600
No more Mr. Nice Guy, no siree.

1037
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,600
Hello little Prince.

1038
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Who are you?

1039
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,200
Went and pledged your
love to another?

1040
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:32,600
What are you talking about?
This is Odette!

1041
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,800
No! Odette is mine!

1042
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:41,800
It's you!
You have no power here!

1043
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:46,400
I made a vow!
A vow of everlasting love!

1044
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:55,000
You made a vow alright!
A vow of everlasting death!

1045
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,200
No! Odette!

1046
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,200
You should have left her to me.

1047
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,200
Now, Odette will die.

1048
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,200
Odette!

1049
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Odette.

1050
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:23,600
She's fading fast, little prince.
-No!

1051
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,800
Gosh, something goes wrong.

1052
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,600
If you hurry, little Prince,

1053
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:50,200
I'll let you see her one
last time! -Go!

1054
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,200
There she is.

1055
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,600
I don't think she's
gonna make it.

1056
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,800
Ease fly, Odette. Ok, good girl.

1057
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,200
Come on now.

1058
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,200
Odette.

1059
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,200
Oh, what have I done to you.

1060
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,400
Forgive me Odette, forgive me.

1061
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,800
Derek...
-Yes Odette...

1062
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:04,800
I'm here
-Derek, I feel so weak.

1063
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,000
I think, I am...

1064
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:14,200
No! You'll live Odette!
The vow I made was for you!

1065
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:20,000
I know. I love you Derek.

1066
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:27,400
Odette, Odette, Odette!

1067
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,600
I made The vow for her!
Do you hear?

1068
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:38,000
The vow I made was for her!

1069
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,800
No need to shout.

1070
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,400
Don't let her die!

1071
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,800
Is that a threat?

1072
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,200
Don't you dare let her die!

1073
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,600
Oh, it is a threat.

1074
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:52,800
You're the only one with
the power! Now do it!

1075
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,600
Only if you defeat... me!

1076
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,800
The great animal!

1077
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,400
I bet on the animal.

1078
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,800
Noooooo!

1079
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,000
I won't let her die!

1080
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,800
The bow, Derek's bow!

1081
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,600
Swim to the bottom of the lake
and get the bow.

1082
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:31,800
Throw it, out! Throw it!
Throw it! Yeah...

1083
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:39,000
Wake up, wake up, hallo
Good luck.

1084
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:46,000
Oh, please... -Brom.
-Oh please, oh please, Nooo...

1085
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,400
Forgive me Odette.

1086
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:18,200
Forgive me.
I only wanted to break the spell.

1087
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,200
To prove my love.

1088
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:31,200
I love you. You're kindness and
courage, I always have.

1089
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,800
Derek?
-Odette?

1090
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,800
Oh, Derek!

1091
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:48,400
Well, there you have it,
everlasting love.

1092
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,600
Well, Rogers, old man.

1093
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,400
I suppose you owe
me an appology.

1094
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,800
After all, if it
weren't for me.

1095
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,200
The great animal would
still be live.

1096
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,800
No... -what?
-Great animal -Nooo...

1097
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,800
It's alive!

1098
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,200
Uberta.
-Rogers.

1099
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:57,200
I don't care if every one
else don't have a day off.

1100
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,000
The prince wants
a fighting air-force.

1101
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,600
And it's my job to get
you, birds in shape.

1102
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,200
You are in Puffin's army now.

1103
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,000
General Puffin!

1104
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I am ready for my kiss,
Mademoiselle.

1105
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,600
Don't be too disappointed
Jean Bob,

1106
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
if nothing happens.

1107
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:26,000
Finaly, after all these years.
I shall return to my throne.

1108
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,800
Don't forget to write.

1109
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,000
You still don't believe me,
do you?

1110
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,800
The only thing you're
going to turn is red.

1111
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,800
Well, I am ready. Odette.

1112
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:52,000
Walla, well Speed, what do
you have to say now?

1113
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,200
Uh... -That's what I thought.

1114
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,600
And now, if you don't mind,

1115
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,000
I've got some shmuzzing to do.

1116
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Would you like a kiss too, Speed?

1117
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,400
Naaa... I am happy as a turtle.

1118
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,400
Bonjour Madame.

1119
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:20,400
Ehh... Uh-uh,
the ladies still fall for me.

1120
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,400
Will you love me Derek,
Till the day I die?

1121
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,200
No, much longer than that, Odette.

1122
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:43,800
Much longer.

1123
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Subtitle: Moti K.
Oren K.

1124
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:54,000
Far longer than forever.

1125
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,000
I'll hold you in my heart.

1126
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:07,200
It's almost like
you're here with me.

1127
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:12,000
Although we're far apart.

1128
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Far longer than forever.

1129
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:25,400
As constant as a star.

1130
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:38,000
I close my eyes and
I am where where you are.

1131
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:46,400
Sure as the dawn brings the sunrise.

1132
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:53,200
We've an unshakable bond.

1133
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Destined to last
for a lifetime and beyond.

1134
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:10,600
Far longer than forever.
-Far longer than forever.

1135
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,800
Like no love every known

1136
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:27,400
And with your love
I'll never be alone.

1137
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:58,000
Far longer than forever.
-Far longer than forever.

1138
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:03,200
Like no love every known

1139
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:14,800
And with your love
I'll never be alone.

1140
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:21,600
Far longer than forever.

1141
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:29,000
Much stronger than forever.

1142
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:42,800
And with your love
I'll never be alone.

1143
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,400
Never, never be alone.

1144
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:55,000
Never, never be alone.

1145
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:04,000
Far longer than forever.

1146
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,200
I knew that we belonged together.

1147
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,600
Long before I knew your name

1148
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,200
And the only thing I longed for.

1149
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:42,600
Was a sign to prove
you felt the same.

1150
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,400
Somehow I knew your every secret.

1151
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,800
Just by looking in your eyes.

1152
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,800
From the very moment I met you,

1153
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,800
I was thinking of
the rest of our lives.

1154
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,200
Just say to me.

1155
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I'm gonna love you
'til the end of the time.

1156
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:07,200
Somehow two hearts,
have made a friend of time.

1157
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:16,800
Eternity, eternity is on our side.

1158
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,800
I'm not afraid to say forever.

1159
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,200
You have made me feel so sure.

1160
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,200
'Cause I know it's everlasting

1161
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:30,400
And I've never had
this feeling before,

1162
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:33,000
Keep telling me,

1163
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:38,400
I'm gonna love you
'til the end of time.

1164
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:43,600
Somehow two hearts
have made a friend of time.

1165
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:52,800
Eternity, I'll love you for eternity.

1166
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,200
Caught in the tide

1167
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:58,200
And it brought me to you,

1168
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,800
Under a spell

1169
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:06,000
And now I know
that dreams come true.

1170
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:15,000
I'm gonna love you
'til the end of time.

1171
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:20,000
Somehow two hearts
have made a friend of time.

1172
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:29,400
Eternity, eternity, is on our side.

1173
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:37,400
I'm gonna love you
'til the end of time.

1174
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:42,400
Somehow two hearts
have made a friend of time.

1175
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:53,000
Eternity, eternity, is on our side.
-is on our side.

1176
01:24:54,600 --> 01:25:00,200
I'm gonna love you 'til the end
of time. -'til the end of time.

1177
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:04,800
Somehow two hearts
have made a friend of time.

1178
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:15,800
Eternity, eternity, is on our side.

1179
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:29,200
Eternity, I'll love you for eternity.
