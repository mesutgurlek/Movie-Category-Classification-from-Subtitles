1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:07,370
Fairy tales can come true

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,251
It can happen to you

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,094
If you're young at heart

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,453
For it's hard, you will find

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,373
To be narrow of mind

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,418
If you're young at heart

7
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,459
You can go to extremes

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,576
With impossible schemes

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,894
You can laugh when your dreams

10
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,733
Fall apart at the seams

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,336
And life gets more exciting
with each passing day

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,696
And love is either in your heart

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,611
Or on its way

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,453
Don't you know that it's worth

15
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,008
Every treasure on earth

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,217
To be young at heart

17
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,293
For as rich as you are

18
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,053
It's much better by far

19
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,019
To be young at heart

20
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,258
And if you should survive

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,934
To a hundred and five

22
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,773
Look at all you'll derive

23
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,499
Out of being alive

24
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,378
And here is the best part

25
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,416
You have a head start

26
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:36,372
If you are among the very young at heart

27
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,135
'One! Two!

28
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,336
'Three! Four! '

29
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,898
'One! Two! Three! Four!

30
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,130
'Five! Six!

31
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,176
'Seven! Eight!

32
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,216
'Nine! Ten! '

33
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,135
Quarter?

34
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,654
Next week I'll take the black corner.

35
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,937
- Here's your crackers, Aunt Jessie.
- Thank you.

36
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,092
- Oh, who won the fight?
- Good night, Laurie.

37
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,492
Good night, Laurie.

38
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,935
Night, Pop. Good night, Aunt Jessie.

39
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,139
- Care to join me?
- No. When are you gonna stop eating?

40
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,575
- I'm hungry.
- Still?

41
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,857
It's very bad for you
to eat just before you go to bed.

42
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,579
- I know.
- Oh, what have you got here?

43
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,616
Chicken, huh? Mmm.

44
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,493
Fran and the White Knight.
They're home early.

45
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,292
Good night.

46
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,336
Good night, Bob.

47
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,132
- Wonder why.
- I don't know.

48
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,136
One thing I love about Bob Neary,
he's such a gentleman.

49
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,498
I love the way he jumps out of the car
and holds the door open for her.

50
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,814
Amy! Laurie!

51
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,856
Aunt Jessie. Pop.

52
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,896
- Well, it happened tonight.
- What?

53
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,936
- We're engaged!
- Huh?

54
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,170
- It's the biggest!
- What's going on?

55
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,058
- Meet the future Mrs Robert Neary.
- The what?

56
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,495
- I'm engaged.
- You're engaged?

57
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,536
- Seven dates.
- Let me see.

58
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,374
The biggest, most vulgar diamond.
100 carats at least.

59
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,452
- Oh, at least.
- Tell us exactly what happened.

60
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,452
I guess I was just looking my most beautiful,

61
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,373
what with Laurie's dress and Amy's brooch.

62
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,817
I could see he was... Well, it was my idea
to go out on the terrace during the dance.

63
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,290
"Fran," he said,
"all I am, all I ever hope to be..."

64
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,689
Then he just stood there and looked...

65
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,293
and looked...

66
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,336
Well, he looked a little fat.

67
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,256
Well, he is fat.

68
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,695
- Oh, Fran.
- This is wonderful!

69
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,055
So he is a little fat - who cares?

70
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,529
Don't say that! Let me see your ring.

71
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,215
- Isn't that something?
- It's the biggest thing I've ever seen.

72
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,414
- What's the matter, Pop?
- Nothing.

73
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,060
- You are happy, aren't you?
- I am if you are.

74
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,938
- Of course I am.
- Naturally, she's happy.

75
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,650
I think he's the biggest real estate operator
in Connecticut, he's rebuilt half this town.

76
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,776
And he's coming to dinner tomorrow.

77
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,897
- When's the wedding, Fran?
- Oh... June, I guess.

78
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,370
- There goes our quartet.
- Unless Jessie takes up the harp.

79
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,657
This is your sister,
your tin-ear sister, remember?

80
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,856
You'll have to get another harp player.

81
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,057
- It doesn't have to be a fancy dinner.
- I know.

82
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,132
Just the best linen, the best silver...

83
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,176
That must be Bob. I'll get it.

84
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,809
Oh, and it has to be duck tomorrow night.
He loves duck.

85
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,773
Oh, Bob?

86
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,738
Oh, just wonderfully. Everybody's so excited.

87
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,776
Yes, everybody.

88
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,816
Well, a little envious, naturally.

89
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,050
Girls, up, up.

90
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,894
What can I say?
Except you've made me the happiest...

91
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,330
Oh, don't be foolish.
I'll go on the diet with you.

92
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,814
- Amy?
- Mm?

93
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,573
Do you think she really loves him?

94
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,616
She's gonna marry him.

95
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,976
Oh, I know but they've only had seven dates.

96
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,056
It can happen.

97
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,496
It can happen the first time
you see someone.

98
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,334
I know they write it
and sing about it and all that stuff

99
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,376
but don't tell me you buy it.

100
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,295
You're young, you can afford to be cynical.
Wait till you're my age, you'll turn romantic.

101
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,975
That's a nice thing to say
after I practically brought you up.

102
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,451
Didn't I have the measles the same time
you did, out of sheer companionship?

103
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,815
You character! You gave them to me.

104
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,856
I shared them.

105
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,896
There's a difference.

106
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:51,930
Well... Anyway, I kind of envy Fran,
even if she has talked herself into it.

107
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,336
It's gotta be a good feeling.

108
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,415
- What do you say we make a deal?
- Hmm?

109
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,060
- Double or nothing.
- Double what?

110
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,096
Double wedding.

111
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,853
We find two guys
with a good sense of humour.

112
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,329
That always helps.

113
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,578
That's one thing I've gotta have
when I get married - lots of laughs.

114
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,619
That's the trouble with
most of the marriages I've seen, Amy.

115
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,531
Not enough laughs.

116
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,696
Or?

117
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,773
Oh. Or we end up old maids on the hill,
you and me.

118
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,216
Deal?

119
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,216
I asked you a question. Is it a deal?

120
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,932
I don't know.

121
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,256
- Hey, wait a minute.
- What?

122
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,379
- You're not holding out on me, are you?
- Oh, now, really.

123
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,052
Sure?

124
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,370
You know there isn't anyone.

125
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,653
Unless it's Ernie, the romantic plumber.

126
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,180
Oh. Poor Ernie.

127
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,896
- You know something?
- What?

128
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,017
I like him. I think he's very sweet.

129
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,056
Well, he is.

130
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,700
Isn't fair to call him a plumber either.

131
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,294
- What would you call him?
- He's the boss.

132
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,975
He doesn't go out on jobs any more
since he owns the store.

133
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,531
Only reason he comes here to fix things
is because of you, and you know it.

134
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,576
Like sinks and things.

135
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,176
He's on the disposal now. He's been
working on it six weeks, it isn't fixed yet.

136
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,613
I wonder why.

137
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,373
Ah, well.

138
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,132
Ernie notwithstanding,

139
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,498
after looking this town over I'd say the Tuttle
family were sure of one old maid.

140
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,650
Two. We made a deal, remember?

141
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,496
Can't you just hear people saying,
"My, my, there go the Tuttle girls now,

142
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,696
"couple of Whistler's Mothers.

143
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,214
"Been together nigh on 60 years now."

144
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,817
- Good night, Laurie.
- Night.

145
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,456
Would you mind
leaving the door open, please?

146
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,659
Thanks.

147
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:02,219
The night is dressed up for dreaming

148
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,977
And on the meadows below

149
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:15,533
A star falls out of the heavens

150
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,531
And fades

151
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,056
In the afterglow

152
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:28,534
The wind embraces the willow

153
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:35,058
The ivy clings to the tree

154
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:43,535
My arms are waiting to hold my love

155
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:51,059
Wherever my lover may be

156
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:58,898
And so I'll walk in the moonlight...

157
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,016
Awful pretty music.

158
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,852
Awful pretty.

159
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,578
Fix the sink.

160
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,896
Yes'm.

161
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,098
Well.

162
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,331
- That was lovely, really lovely.
- Thank you, Pop.

163
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,775
I have one criticism, however.

164
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,213
Oh, naturally.

165
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,736
If you would just look at the conductor
once in a while.

166
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,333
Like this, Pop?

167
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,618
An orchestra, no matter how small,
should have only once voice!

168
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,692
- The conductor's.
- Right.

169
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,816
You idiots. You're all idiots.

170
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,257
How three such beautiful girls
can make three such horrible sounds.

171
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,900
- Now, your blood pressure.
- It's my blood pressure.

172
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,335
- You're my sister, not my doctor.
- Sure.

173
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:05,289
Amy, you're wanted in the kitchen. He won't
leave until you're satisfied with his work.

174
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,450
- Thank you.
- That Ernie!

175
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,929
- I've got to get to work.
- Goodbye, sweetie.

176
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,056
- Where's my hat?
- In the hall.

177
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,608
- Goodbye, Pop.
- Where are you going?

178
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,817
- Upstairs to get beautiful for tonight.
- It'll take seven hours?

179
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,849
Face it, Pop, with what you gave me
to start with, it'll take all of seven hours.

180
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,773
Where's my briefcase? I left it right here.

181
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,055
You left it upstairs. I'll get it.

182
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,219
I could've sworn I left it on that chair.

183
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,052
Oh, thanks.

184
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,176
What do you expect? Brahms?

185
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,377
That's as quiet as I can get it.

186
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,578
- I'll replace it if you like.
- No, it's much better, honestly it is.

187
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,616
Thanks.

188
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,533
Look at you. And look at those hands.

189
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,178
Oh, well...

190
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,048
You shouldn't go out on jobs
with a shirt and tie and all.

191
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,700
You have men in overalls
and you pay them.

192
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,374
I don't go out on jobs any more, Amy.

193
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,373
Just this one, cos it's on the way to work
and... cos...

194
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,974
I know. Well, you'd better wash up now.

195
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:21,088
If you're gonna sell any of those nice white
refrigerators you'd better look the part.

196
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,852
Not there.

197
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,896
- Upstairs.
- Sure.

198
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,656
- Ernie.
- Huh?

199
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,971
Take your coat off
before you wash your hands.

200
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,855
Oh. Yeah.

201
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,889
- Hurry up, Laurie.
- Hello, Mr Tuttle.

202
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,972
- Just going upstairs to wash my hands.
- That's good.

203
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,016
- Thanks.
- I'll walk with you.

204
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,852
Good. Bye, Jess.

205
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,736
Hi, Mr Tuttle!

206
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,656
- Laurie, Laurie, it's happened!
- Is it Ladybird?

207
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,813
- Yeah, she's having pups. Seven already!
- You go ahead.

208
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,209
Mothers are more important than fathers.

209
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,576
- Hi!
- Get back! Hurry up!

210
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,619
It's just like you said, Laurie -
right on the front lawn. No dignity!

211
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,895
- Are there really seven?
- Eight!

212
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,050
- Eight?
- Correction - nine.

213
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,096
Oh, he's so little.

214
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,772
- Hi.
- Hi.

215
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,409
- Number nine. The last, and the runt.
- Oh, that's awful.

216
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,570
Yep, life begins in frustration.

217
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,493
- Well, Mrs Ridgefield, congratulations.
- Thank you.

218
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,538
- I just can't thank you enough.
- Don't mention it.

219
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,532
- Your problems are just beginning.
- What?

220
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,579
- One too many came to dinner.
- Oh, I see.

221
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,329
Oh, dear. Well, what'll I do?

222
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,571
- Bottle-feed him.
- Me? I'm a busy housewife.

223
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,688
- I've got a large house to run...
- Bottle-feed him or you can drown him.

224
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,897
- Drown him?
- Easy, easy, you're a latecomer.

225
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,496
Call yourself a vet? You're supposed
to save lives, not destroy them.

226
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,172
I'm not a vet.

227
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,935
- Bottle-feed him or drown him.
- Please let me take him, Mrs Ridgefield.

228
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:11,219
I always wanted you to have the best
in the litter, Laurie, and he is the littlest.

229
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,088
- No, I want him, number nine.
- He's yours.

230
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,648
Well, that's settled. Oh, Miss um...

231
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,493
- Tuttle.
- You'll bottle-feed him, huh?

232
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,536
- I'll bottle-feed him.
- Good.

233
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,692
Hey, that's not
old Gregory Tuttle's daughter?

234
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,294
Yes, she is, she lives right next door.

235
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,575
I don't know how to thank you.

236
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,130
Don't mention it.
Call me any time you have a litter.

237
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,290
Well, I will. Thank you!

238
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,974
- Cute little puppy, isn't he?
- I like him.

239
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,416
Oh, wait a minute,
you don't think I was serious?

240
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,890
Do I look like I'd want to drown a puppy?

241
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,936
Well, do I?

242
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,776
- Not really.
- Shake.

243
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,210
- I'm an old friend of the family.
- You?

244
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,416
- Yeah.
- I never saw you before in my life.

245
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,856
Well, my father went to school
with your father.

246
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,615
- He did?
- Yeah. My name's Burke, Alex Burke.

247
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,055
Oh. My name is Tuttle, Laurie Tuttle.

248
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,096
Hiya, Tuttle.

249
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,216
- Hiya, Burke.
- Hi.

250
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,373
Um, in this pocket
I have a letter to your father. Is he home?

251
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,770
Just missed him, he's on his way
to the music foundation.

252
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,420
- He's the dean of faculty there.
- Wonderful.

253
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,016
I also have a letter to the president
of the foundation. How do I get there?

254
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,489
Two blocks east of Lamont
and there you are.

255
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,855
- The foundation?
- No, the traffic booth.

256
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,896
- Thanks.
- Only kidding.

257
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,290
The policeman there
will tell you the rest of the way.

258
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,770
By the way, what are you having
for dinner tonight?

259
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,374
Um, roast duck. Why?

260
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,894
Duck? Wonderful, it's my favourite.

261
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,939
You know something,
what with the pups and dinner tonight,

262
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,978
this is about the third happiest day of my life.

263
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,016
But nobody asked you to dinner.

264
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,660
Your father will. I'll see to it.

265
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,732
Those bottle feedings - for the first six
weeks, two every night at 2am and 6am.

266
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,253
I'll see you.

267
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,893
Oh, don't set an extra place, don't bother.

268
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,574
- He won't even be here.
- You wanna bet?

269
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,573
He has a letter for Pop,
that doesn't mean he'll be invited to dinner.

270
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,619
Not only will he come to dinner
but he'll tell us where to sit.

271
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,376
And he'll do the carving, and dominate
the conversation completely.

272
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,815
And I'll bet you he has two desserts.

273
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,130
- Oh, Laurie.
- My impression of Mr Burke.

274
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,735
- Sounds like a vacuum cleaner salesman.
- Foot in the door type.

275
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,291
You girls will have to share him
because I'll be devoting my charms to Bob.

276
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,336
Laurie, here comes Pop.

277
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,651
- And alone.
- I don't believe it.

278
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,292
Well, I'll be...

279
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,737
Girls...

280
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,050
Mr Burke.

281
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,495
- What are you looking for?
- Paper.

282
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,731
The boy generally tries
to lose it in this bush.

283
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,940
- There you are.
- Thanks.

284
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,739
- How are they doing?
- Fine. In great voice.

285
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,493
Mrs Ridgefield's got
a sleepless night ahead.

286
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,175
Dogs... Bah! If they keep me awake,
it's your fault.

287
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,538
They will. They're not only loud,
they're off pitch, like German opera.

288
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,817
Your father was a great man
and a great musician.

289
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,290
What would he say if he knew
you had midwifed a litter of pups

290
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,530
and, worse yet, disparaged Wagner?

291
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,214
My father taught me
to love dogs and Mozart.

292
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,416
- Maybe not in that order.
- Bah!

293
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,095
Mr Tuttle, I don't understand
your affection for that word.

294
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,329
Bah!

295
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,215
- Let me have your hat.
- Thanks.

296
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,016
Oh, I don't...

297
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,252
Something's wrong here.

298
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,580
- Pa!
- How wonderful to see you.

299
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,616
Did you have a nice day?

300
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,260
- Hello, Pop.
- Hello, darling.

301
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,615
Nice day at the conservatory?

302
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,292
Hiya, Burke.

303
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,336
Hiya, Tuttle.

304
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,256
Well, did I exaggerate?

305
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,252
No, they're pretty. All very pretty.

306
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,774
- Oh, thank you.
- Pop, won't you introduce us?

307
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,374
I'm sorry! Girls, this is Alex Burke.

308
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,693
He's full of opinions, one of which is that he
can write good music on a time schedule.

309
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,568
He's opinionated, he's conceited,
he's arrogant and disrespectful.

310
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,616
- But I like him.
- Thanks.

311
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,851
How about that big build-up
you were gonna give me?

312
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,896
- I changed my mind.
- Oh?

313
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,450
Aren't you gonna mention my talents?
We talked about it.

314
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,089
They only have to look at you
to see that you have no talent.

315
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,978
I'm Fran and you look talented,
whatever you do.

316
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,972
- Thank you. I compose.
- I'm Amy, what do you compose?

317
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,494
- Anything and everything.
- Trash.

318
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:08,529
Ignore him. I've given up tone poems
to work on a musical for the theatre.

319
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,736
- In New York?
- For next season?

320
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,177
New York. Whether it gets on next season
depends on the efficiency of the producer.

321
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,376
He's given me a generous advance

322
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,499
in return for which I shall deliver
a complete and delightful score

323
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,650
at 9am, September 1.

324
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,528
- You hope.
- I hope. Date of production is his problem.

325
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,937
- Evening.
- Hello. May I, er, help you?

326
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,136
- Oh, thanks.
- It's a pleasure.

327
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,291
- I thought you said you had three daughters.
- He has.

328
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,848
This is Alex Burke, son of my old friend.
Aunt Jessie.

329
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,819
Happy to know you, Aunt Jessie.
After all, a lot depends on you.

330
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,290
Let's put it this way,
a lot depends on your dinner tonight.

331
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,699
What?

332
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,773
All the way home, I've been toying
with your brother's invitation

333
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,816
of board and room with this happy family.

334
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,209
- What?
- Don't get too enthusiastic.

335
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,256
It's not decided yet.

336
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,173
As a musician, I don't care where I sleep -

337
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,650
attic, park bench -
but about cuisine I'm a stickler.

338
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,494
Just a moment. You all know
the president of the foundation.

339
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,619
- Tough customer, right? Cold-blooded.
- Ice water in his veins.

340
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,215
This young man talked him
into giving him a job at the foundation,

341
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,215
the argument being, he needed the income
to work on this Broadway opera.

342
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,372
What's more,
he did it in just seven minutes.

343
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,416
Correction - ten minutes, I timed it.

344
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,379
But that included the introductions
and the goodbyes.

345
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,499
What do you want me to do?
After all, I have some affection for his father.

346
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,330
Um, somebody else expected?

347
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,254
- Yeah, Bob Neary.
- Oh, Bob Neary. Good.

348
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,453
Fran.

349
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,412
Bob.

350
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,456
Oh! Excuse me!

351
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,809
- Well, hello, Bob.
- Hello, Fran.

352
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,094
I drove around the block,
didn't want to be early.

353
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,932
You're just in time.

354
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,772
Well! Hi, everybody!

355
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,249
- Hi, Bob.
- Amy, Laurie, Jessie.

356
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,296
- Hi, Bob. Alex Burke.
- Nice to know you.

357
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,372
- Flowers! For Aunt Jessie, no doubt.
- Er...

358
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,577
- There you are.
- Thank you. Thank you, Bob.

359
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,890
We might as well sit down, we're all hungry.

360
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,814
Roast duck tonight.
Why don't you and Fran sit over there?

361
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,856
- Pop...
- I know where I sit.

362
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,852
Amy, you sit here. Laurie, you're over here.

363
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,249
I'm in between. I'll get those, Aunt Jessie.

364
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,296
Thank you.

365
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,771
- May we start?
- Oh, sure.

366
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,258
Thank you.

367
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,416
Mmm. Aunt Jessie...

368
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,016
Come on, boy!

369
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,297
Come on! Number nine!

370
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,776
Here's what I call a clam!

371
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,658
Oh!

372
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,015
Come on, boy.

373
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,056
That's a boy, come on, come on.

374
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,938
There we go. That's a good boy.

375
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,375
That's enough exercise for one day.

376
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,930
You just sit here with me for a while
and we'll read.

377
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,488
Boy, that water sure is good.

378
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,175
- Is that Alex's sweater?
- Uh-huh.

379
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,173
- What's that?
- It's an A for Alex.

380
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,139
- No, I don't mean this. What's this?
- Oh, notes, musical notes.

381
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,496
- Oh. Kinda like a monogram, huh?
- That's right.

382
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,892
I got a sweater at home, Amy,
but it's not white.

383
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,655
- Would you like a monogram on it?
- I sure would. Would you, Amy?

384
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,857
Sure. What'll we use instead of notes?

385
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,976
Oh, yeah. What could we use?

386
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,335
Monkey wrench!

387
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,612
- Plunger!
- Oh, Ernie!

388
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,935
Well, I'll think about it awhile.

389
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,054
You call that music? Turn the thing off.

390
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,096
- It's a hit song, Pop.
- Bah.

391
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,136
- Wanna hear the words?
- No.

392
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,778
Good.

393
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,579
I'm ready, willing and able

394
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,770
And honey, now it's up to you

395
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:27,535
So lay your cards on the table

396
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,169
And tell me what you plan to do

397
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,889
I'm ready, I'm able and willing

398
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,529
To join you in a little fun

399
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,259
But I won't take second billing

400
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,889
I've got to be your number one

401
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,575
I'm ready to give you my heart, dear

402
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,209
I'm willing to hand you the key

403
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,895
And I'm able to say from the start, dear

404
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,177
It's never belonged to anyone else but me!

405
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,218
Oh, I'm ready, I'm willing and able

406
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,975
So if you want a love that's true

407
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,575
Just lay your cards on the table

408
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:15,050
Cos honey, now it's up to you

409
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,096
Check the chow.

410
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,613
I'm ready

411
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,816
Oh, yes, you know I'm ready, baby

412
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,379
I'm willing

413
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,576
Oh, yes, you know I'm willing, baby

414
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,059
I'm able

415
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,529
Oh, yes, you know I'm able, baby

416
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:32,249
Now I've stated my condition
I've got lots of ammunition

417
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,571
Ready, willing and I'm able

418
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,209
So if you want a love that's true

419
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,929
Just lay your cards on the table

420
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,011
Cos honey

421
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:50,254
Honey, now it's up to you

422
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,216
Where've you been?

423
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,939
I had to go half a mile
to find some dry wood.

424
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,215
- Aren't you tired?
- I'm bushed.

425
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,416
Alex, it's finished!

426
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,373
That's fast work. Let's have a look at it.

427
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,579
- That's what I call a good job.
- Thank you.

428
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,414
Amy, from now on, you do all my sewing.

429
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,252
Any time.

430
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,693
Right.

431
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,736
How do you like it, Aunt Jessie?

432
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,415
It's beautiful. If you kids want dinner,
you'd better get more clams.

433
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,617
More clams coming up.
What about it, Tuttle?

434
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,656
I'm with you, Burke!

435
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:38,052
Hey, you two are supposed to be digging!
I want elbows and bottoms. Dig!

436
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,734
Come on, Burke.
Wanna race to the far rock?

437
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,936
- Let's go.
- On your mark, get set...

438
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,170
Hold this, will ya? Go!

439
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:54,372
You know, I wonder why
somebody hasn't thought about it before.

440
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,054
- What?
- About buying this strip of beach,

441
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:01,258
tearing down those bungalows
and putting up a whole string of hotels.

442
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,296
- Oh, Bob!
- It's not a bad idea.

443
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,575
That's what they got in Miami.

444
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,493
Whoever heard of beach hotels
in Connecticut?

445
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,536
That's why it's a good idea.

446
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,571
If I could buy it in your name,
it'd be a better idea.

447
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,733
Fran, I'd consider it,
if you'd only set a date for our wedding.

448
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:23,769
We've only got a couple more weeks.
You can still become a June bride.

449
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:27,535
Let me have the summer, Bob.
We'll talk about it in the fall, huh?

450
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,929
OK, honey.

451
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,376
How would you like a big drink of water?

452
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,974
- Think you're big enough?
- I'm big enough.

453
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,620
Put me down! I'll make a deal with you.

454
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,137
If you can dig more clams than I can
in ten minutes you can throw me in. OK?

455
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,778
It's a deal.

456
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,532
One.

457
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,132
Two.

458
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,536
Three, four.

459
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,050
- And five.
- I give up.

460
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,131
- City boy!
- You win.

461
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,415
Course I won. Six.

462
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,456
- Laurie.
- What?

463
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,179
There's something I'd like to say to you.

464
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,015
Is it about clams?

465
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,136
- Huh?
- No.

466
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,097
Yeah.

467
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,933
There's the male clam and the female clam.

468
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,976
No! I always thought...

469
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,733
Yep. This is the male clam.

470
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,415
A female clam is any clam
you find with its mouth open.

471
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,810
- You know, yak-yak-yak-yak...
- Oh, you...!

472
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,095
- Why did you do that?
- I've been waiting all day for that.

473
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:51,491
All I wanted to do is... give you this.

474
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,932
I hope you like it.

475
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,496
Read it.

476
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,416
"For our girl, from me and Number Nine."

477
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,651
- Like it?
- Oh, Alex.

478
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,696
I love it.

479
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:22,772
Hold me in your arms

480
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,456
Tonight was meant to be

481
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,213
Hold me in your arms

482
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:36,054
Thrill me with your charms

483
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:41,089
Your lips were meant for me

484
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,570
Never let me go

485
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,448
Suddenly I know

486
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:55,336
I've never loved before

487
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:00,175
With every kiss my head is spinning

488
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:06,733
This is the moment I've waited for

489
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,929
Tonight is only the beginning

490
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:18,812
Hold me in your arms for evermore

491
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:25,215
Hold me in your arms

492
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:31,659
Tonight was meant to be

493
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,459
Hold me in your arms

494
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:39,136
Thrill me with your charms

495
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:44,692
Your lips were meant for me

496
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:48,011
Never let me go

497
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,412
Suddenly I know

498
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:59,018
I've never loved before

499
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,890
With every kiss, my head is spinning

500
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:12,375
This is the moment I've waited for

501
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,419
Tonight is only the beginning

502
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,210
Hold me in your arms

503
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:32,050
For evermore

504
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,575
- You've got a class at three. You coming?
- I got a half-hour yet.

505
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,299
- I'm waiting for Barney Sloan.
- Who?

506
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,689
A piano player,
he's gonna help arrange this.

507
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,739
If you stole from the right composers
you wouldn't need an arranger.

508
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,380
- When's he due?
- Right now.

509
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,577
Might not get here for a week,
might not get here at all.

510
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,651
I thought only trombone players drank.

511
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,857
Barney doesn't drink,
he's a little unpredictable.

512
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:11,616
That's an ideal collaboration - unpredictable
scorer, unpredictable arranger.

513
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,931
- Well, I'll see you at the foundation.
- Yeah.

514
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,336
I got it.

515
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,898
Hi.

516
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,772
Hi.

517
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,816
Come in, come in.

518
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,576
- Glad to see you.
- Uh-huh.

519
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,732
Did you have a tough time finding the place?

520
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,776
Uh-uh.

521
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,299
Figures. Rug on the floor, piano,

522
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,894
the smell of cooking from the kitchen.

523
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,251
Homes like these
are the backbone of the nation.

524
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,969
- Where's the spinning wheel?
- Shut up. Did you miss the train?

525
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,211
- I ignored the train.
- Why? I sent you the fare.

526
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,256
Five bucks, I bet it on a horse.

527
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,649
A horse I could've bought for seven.

528
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,493
Had a lovely name that I can't remember.

529
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:26,016
You're late, Barney.
If I don't get out of here, I'll be late.

530
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,297
I got a class at the foundation, three to four.

531
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:33,055
Oh, incidentally, I got you that job
we talked about.

532
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:37,179
- Attractive surroundings, I'm sure.
- It's a joint but it's convenient.

533
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:41,378
Downtown. You'll play piano and you'll sing.
Salary's small.

534
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,772
- Tips on the plate?
- Tips on the plate.

535
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,333
Every little bit helps.

536
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,650
Yeah.

537
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:57,289
It's no better, no worse
than the job you had in New York.

538
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,530
Different class of people maybe.

539
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,576
Yeah.

540
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,130
Suburban drunks. They don't listen either.

541
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,412
When I get back tonight
we'll work out a room.

542
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,809
Plenty of boarding houses around.

543
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,856
Meanwhile...

544
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,215
Your music must be lousy.

545
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,690
- You wouldn't be here if it were.
- You're too efficient.

546
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:32,695
Start wherever you want. I've got
some of the overture and four of the songs.

547
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,736
You print nice. Real neat.

548
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:39,974
Barney, I gotta take off. If there's anything
you need, there's a woman in the kitchen,

549
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,016
name's Aunt Jessie.

550
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,056
- I know the type.
- So long!

551
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,096
See ya.

552
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,578
For all I know you might be a burglar

553
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,969
with designs on the piano.

554
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,656
Alex told me to introduce myself.
Name's Barney Sloan.

555
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,537
You must be Aunt... something.

556
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,612
- Jessie.
- Yeah, Jessie.

557
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,290
Name fits right in with the curtains
and the lamp.

558
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,018
Very domestic.

559
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,853
My name came first, curtains came after.

560
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,616
What type of aunt are you?

561
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,134
Gruff voice hiding a soft heart type,

562
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:34,691
or the sweet, simple, "Snakes alive, I smell
something burning in the kitchen" type?

563
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,010
Alex should have prepared me for you.

564
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,660
- Would you like a cup of tea?
- Sure.

565
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,652
If I threw in a couple of cakes,
would you object?

566
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,892
How could you know I haven't eaten
since yesterday?

567
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:52,893
I'm the near-sighted, you can't hide
a thing from me type of aunt.

568
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,538
I see.

569
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:58,613
Well, you needn't look so noble.
Tea is just a little hot water.

570
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:03,296
I'll put the kettle on. I'll let you know
what I think about you later.

571
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,935
- Hi!
- Hi. Home early.

572
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,409
- Did you get everything?
- I think so.

573
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,252
Good.

574
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,570
- Got a surprise for you.
- Really?

575
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,220
- Mmm.
- I could use one right about now.

576
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,929
It was so packed in that market I didn't think
I'd ever get waited on.

577
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,608
- What's that?
- The surprise.

578
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,656
- Who?
- Friend of Alex's,

579
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,015
I'm making him tea, just a little hot water.

580
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,331
- That's one of Alex's songs, isn't it?
- Mm-hm.

581
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,570
Hmm... I like what he's doing with it.

582
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:03,489
Hey - get set, you're in for something.

583
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,332
Sounds wonderful.

584
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,136
You a friend of Alex's?

585
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,776
We know each other. I orchestrate his stuff.

586
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,612
Oh.

587
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,656
My name is Laurie.

588
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,176
I, um...

589
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,216
live here.

590
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,256
You got a cigarette?

591
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,136
Mm-hm.

592
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,136
You scared it.

593
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,416
Keep playing.

594
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:57,771
Now I know why they gave me this box
of matches when I bought that thing.

595
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,376
Stubborn, aren't I?

596
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,296
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

597
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,809
- Is that one of Alex's?
- Something of my own.

598
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,856
It's lovely.

599
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,692
Stinks.

600
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,092
You can feel that way if you want to.

601
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,136
I like it.

602
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,776
That all there is to it?

603
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,816
It's only got a middle.

604
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,654
It's only got... You mean
there's no beginning and no end?

605
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,696
Just a middle.

606
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,011
You're going to finish it sometime,
aren't you?

607
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:57,178
Do you think it's right
to leave a song hanging in midair like that?

608
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,216
No face and no feet?

609
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,256
Why not?

610
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,975
Well...

611
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,132
If you finished it, people might get to like it.

612
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,176
You could even have a hit.

613
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,810
They wouldn't let me.

614
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,253
Who?

615
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,736
They. Or whoever it is
that gives out the breaks.

616
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:27,052
What's your name for it?
Lady Luck? The Fates? Destiny?

617
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,656
Oh.

618
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:37,975
They've been having their innings
for as long as I can remember.

619
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,016
You know what a glove man is?

620
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,897
I'm a glove man.

621
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:46,098
You shag flies in a hot sun all your life
but you never go to bat.

622
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:52,255
Like, right off they said, "No parents?
Make him an offer, he'll be all right."

623
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,253
"Education? Grammar school's enough.

624
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,456
"Send him out to work."

625
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,496
So I cooperate.

626
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,459
And then they come up
with a nice big depression, a fat one.

627
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:10,294
But I fooled them, I went out and got a job.
Six years later.

628
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,293
14 dollars a week,
I collected exactly two pay cheques

629
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,610
and then they come up with a war.

630
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,611
"Greetings, my boy.
You too can be a private."

631
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,054
Don't laugh, it was serious.

632
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:32,294
This was my big chance.
I was ready to be a hero, a dead one even.

633
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:36,976
You know, lots of crowds, bands playing,
me in a flag-draped coffin.

634
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,016
Ha! Did I get it?

635
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,658
No.

636
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:44,289
All they figured for me
was a little grape juice in the leg.

637
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,336
Not quite enough to be a hero.

638
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,890
Lots of guys got shot
so it'd just hurt a little bit.

639
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:53,768
Eight or nine years later,
your leg gets a little stiff when it rains.

640
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:57,899
That's my good leg, my pedal foot,
that I play the piano with.

641
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,255
There's more. You wanna hear more?

642
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,536
Yes. Yes, I do.

643
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,416
If you tell the whole story.

644
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,299
What about the talent they gave you?

645
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,653
Sure.

646
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,573
Sure, they said, "Let him have a little talent.

647
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:23,858
"Not enough to do anything great on his own
but just enough to help other people.

648
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,896
"That's what he deserves."

649
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:31,532
Mix a little talent with the rest of that stuff
and you get stumblebum Barney Sloan.

650
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,775
- Barney Sloan...
- Mm-hm.

651
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:39,692
That's my new name.

652
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,488
One I was born with was a little more Italian.

653
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,016
I changed it.
Figured I'd throw 'em off the track.

654
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,852
Not those babies.

655
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,258
You know you're taking the easiest way out.

656
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,173
- How do you figure?
- Anybody can feel sorry for himself.

657
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,332
Who asked you to listen?

658
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:10,253
If it makes you feel better
to be insulting, you just go right ahead.

659
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:15,175
I believe a man decides his own destinies.
If he has enough courage and ambition...

660
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,012
Bite?

661
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,056
No, thank you.

662
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,813
Maybe it isn't my business, I don't know.

663
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:28,178
But if you go to work and finish that song,
or any song for that matter...

664
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,936
They wouldn't like it. I tell you,
they're up there working overtime on me.

665
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:36,376
What some people will do
for time and a half...

666
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:42,012
I can see this is very painful for you.
Shall we talk about something else?

667
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:46,218
Why? Talking about my lousy luck
is the only fun I ever have.

668
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,336
- Here's tea!
- Oh, Aunt Jessie,

669
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,376
can you do something for him?

670
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,213
Sure. Get a net and send for the wagon.

671
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,736
Were you smiling just then?

672
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,776
I don't know. Was I?

673
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,930
- Do me a favour, will you?
- What?

674
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,056
Throw back your head and laugh.

675
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,572
Hilariously.

676
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,696
- Why?
- No reason.

677
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,736
Just laugh.

678
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,772
Ha. Heh-heh.

679
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,296
- I knew it.
- Knew what?

680
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,336
You don't know how to laugh.

681
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,056
I see what I'm up against -
the gay young thing type.

682
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:28,892
Unimportant species.

683
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:34,899
It's not the quality of your laughter,
it's your attitude.

684
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,413
Attitude?

685
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,049
I asked him to laugh
and he wants to know why he should.

686
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,734
As if somebody has to have
a reason to laugh.

687
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,971
- You don't think so?
- No.

688
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,415
- Do you?
- No.

689
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:55,699
There's a place for people like you
who go around laughing for no reason at all.

690
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,453
- Do you want lemon or cream in your tea?
- Neither.

691
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:03,660
Don't be so contrary, you've got to have
one or the other. You'll have lemon.

692
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,298
There.

693
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,737
Please, Aunt Jessie, don't be hard-boiled,
it doesn't come off.

694
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:12,857
I'm gonna have some tea
and figure this character out.

695
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:17,411
Wait till he has something to eat.
Maybe he'll be a little less vicious.

696
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,929
I'm not too happy with the lyric yet
but I like it musically.

697
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,614
I'm anxious to see what you can do with it.

698
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,930
When did you come up with this one?

699
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,659
Just finished it about an hour ago.

700
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,935
Hey, boy, you workin' or playin'?

701
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:49,897
Assistant manager, you know the type.
"Come on now, everybody get on the ball."

702
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,936
Don't be a wise guy, Sloan.

703
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,659
- What was that?
- You're supposed to be working.

704
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,890
W-O-R-K-l-N-G.

705
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:00,290
That's very good.
Keep that up and you'll be manager.

706
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,531
So you don't like it here?
Suppose you pack up your...

707
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,180
Say, aren't you Lettie Bartell's father?

708
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:10,412
- That's right. You know Lettie?
- I went to school with her. I'm Laurie Tuttle.

709
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:15,449
Oh, say, sure! She talks about you
all the time. Still does, in her letters.

710
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:17,815
- This is my sister, Amy.
- How do you do?

711
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,856
- Mr Burke.
- Hi.

712
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,932
- How is Lettie?
- Married with two children.

713
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:25,488
She's happy as a lark, living in Chicago.

714
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:28,652
- Say hello when you write to her.
- That I will.

715
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:32,449
- How come I never seen you here before?
- We came to hear Mr Sloan.

716
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:37,937
We'll be coming in quite often,
as a matter of fact.

717
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,931
I hope you do, and I mean it.

718
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,976
You ready, Mr Sloan?

719
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:46,336
Any time, Mr Bartell. Any time at all.

720
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:49,253
Thank you. Well, enjoy yourselves, folks.

721
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:52,298
- Glad to have you aboard.
- Nice to see you.

722
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:55,213
I like that Bartell. Nice guy.

723
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:07,936
Two martinis and two vodka gimlets.

724
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:12,172
- Why don't they keep quiet?
- Don't worry, Barney's used to it.

725
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:18,173
There's a somebody I'm longin' to see

726
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:21,448
I hope that she

727
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,691
Turns out to be

728
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:32,054
Someone who'll watch over me

729
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:42,774
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood

730
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:47,170
- I know...
- Why not, baby? Why not?

731
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,979
Give me just one good reason why.

732
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,210
Buy me a drink.

733
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,409
Waiter!

734
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,934
<i>...over me</i>

735
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:03,612
Although I may not

736
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:08,731
Be the man some girls think of

737
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:12,493
As handsome

738
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14,536
But to her heart

739
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:21,296
I'll carry the key

740
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:31,693
Won't you tell her, please,
to put on some speed

741
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,340
Follow my lead

742
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:39,174
Oooh, how I need

743
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:43,372
Someone to watch

744
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:49,658
Over me

745
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,136
Nope, it's not fair.

746
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,416
You've improved an awful lot
in one week, Mr Sloan.

747
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:34,856
- How's that? Better?
- You got me grinning like an idiot.

748
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:37,295
Good, you noticed the resemblance.

749
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:42,858
Say, you weren't by chance sneaking around
my room yesterday while I was out?

750
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:46,296
Was I? I try not to leave fingerprints.

751
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:51,056
It's a fine thing. The minute a fella's back
is turned, you hang up curtains.

752
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:53,608
Next time I'm putting flowerpots in.

753
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,691
- No flowers.
- Why not?

754
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,736
Well, they use up the oxygen.

755
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:03,090
Give me trouble and I'll be up there
with a lace pillowcase.

756
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,136
- Lace?
- Lace.

757
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:09,816
You may object to living like a human being,
Mr Sloan, but you're gonna sleep like one.

758
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,130
My landlady has instructions to shoot...

759
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:15,178
When I'm finished with the room
I'm starting on you.

760
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:17,216
Look at yourself.

761
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,052
What's the matter with me?

762
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:24,098
What did you cut your hair with?
A lawn mower?

763
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,136
A penknife.

764
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:29,652
And look at your ties, always at half-mast.

765
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:32,334
Say, would you help me a minute, please?

766
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,376
Just hold that open.

767
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:40,057
There's something that you should know
about the state of Connecticut.

768
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,698
What's that?

769
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:44,977
A crease in the pants
is strictly constitutional.

770
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:46,812
It is!

771
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,289
Look, it's Pop's birthday, Barney.

772
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:54,374
I think a pair of pressed pants would be
just the right note for tonight's party.

773
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,416
- I'll think about it.
- OK.

774
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:00,892
By the way, while I'm downtown, um...

775
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:04,211
maybe you could
do a little work for yourself, huh?

776
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,098
- Like what?
- Oh, finishing your song.

777
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,416
Forget about that song.

778
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,129
Think what a kick in the pants
it'd be to them, your destinies,

779
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,495
if you came up with a big hit, huh?

780
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:18,536
What good's a hit song?

781
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,576
Here we go again.

782
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:25,211
Yeah, it gets your picture in Life, and
maybe get a new suit, a lot of hullabaloo,

783
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,975
then one day I'm walking along
and down comes a bolt of lightning.

784
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:31,016
Pow! D-E-D, dead.

785
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,455
Do you know that you're impossible?

786
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:37,692
Six to an even that's the way I leave
the world - lightning. Bet?

787
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:41,898
All I know is that there's a straitjacket
waiting for you with your number on it.

788
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,971
Like the spoon.

789
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:51,977
Uh...

790
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:55,814
I don't want you to think
that that's spur of the moment stuff.

791
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,936
I planned it for a week.

792
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:06,936
It's pretty mild for a week's thought, isn't it?

793
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,250
It's just a friendly kiss.

794
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:10,898
Oh.

795
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:14,734
We're going to be good friends,
aren't we, Barney?

796
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,776
Yes, sure.

797
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,816
I'll work at it.

798
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,410
We're gonna be such good friends

799
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,095
that we won't even have to swap presents
at Christmas.

800
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,136
Practical idea.

801
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:34,338
- Well, I...
- I know, you've gotta rush downtown.

802
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:35,978
Yeah.

803
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,576
See you later.

804
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,090
Don't forget the birthday pants.

805
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:44,739
It's constitutional.

806
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,492
Read all about it!

807
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:59,778
- You know what a parasite is?
- What?

808
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:03,614
Someone who doesn't do their share
of pushing revolving doors.

809
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,656
I pushed.

810
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:09,493
Take one of these, will you?
For appearance's sake.

811
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:12,378
Why should I have a man around
if I can't use him?

812
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:15,258
- Glad you bumped into me, huh?
- I planned it that way.

813
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:18,810
- OK, where's the car?
- Across the street in the lot.

814
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,176
- Laurie...
- Hmm?

815
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,216
I love you.

816
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,096
Laurie.

817
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:34,290
You came out for one present, you said,
for your father.

818
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:38,138
Alex, come see these pedal pushers,
they're adorable.

819
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,653
Yeah.

820
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,173
Laurie.

821
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:46,496
Only 8.95 too, that's very cheap.

822
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:50,698
Pedal pushers for your father?
He won't look good in 'em.

823
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,419
- Silly.
- Didn't hear me before, did you?

824
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,855
You said something?

825
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:59,613
Yeah, I said I loved you, Laurie.

826
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:18,418
- Oh. Wanna chase it?
- Not today.

827
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:23,574
I've been trying to tell you something for the
last five minutes but you won't listen.

828
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,616
I love you, Laurie.

829
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,258
Yeah.

830
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:33,335
- Since when?
- Since the first moment I saw you.

831
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:36,969
It's tough for a guy to be original
when he's in love.

832
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,130
- Well?
- Got your ticket?

833
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,176
Oh. Yeah.

834
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:45,736
I'll get your car.

835
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,692
That was in the nature of a proposal

836
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:53,250
and I expect something
in the nature of an answer.

837
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,376
- You know how I feel.
- How?

838
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:57,416
I adore you.

839
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,298
That's a good start.
We'll be married next week, huh?

840
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:04,013
- Alex, we can't get married next week.
- Why not?

841
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:07,649
Why can't we keep things as they are?
We have so much fun and laughs.

842
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,731
We can be married and have laughs.

843
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,936
- There have been cases.
- Have there?

844
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:16,491
Look, Laurie, get this through your head -
I love you and I need you.

845
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:18,377
Do you?

846
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:22,772
Of course I do. Even if I didn't need you,
you need me to carry your bundles.

847
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:25,169
You know, I hadn't thought of that.

848
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:29,617
There's something else
you should know about me.

849
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:33,978
- I always laugh at the wrong time.
- I know. I heard you.

850
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:36,255
I'll probably laugh all through the ceremony.

851
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:39,457
- What do you think I'll be doing?
- Crazy.

852
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,417
But it might be fun.

853
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,536
You mean that?

854
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:45,973
Mm-hm.

855
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,812
Good.

856
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,252
Stay there.

857
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:55,377
Could you hold these a minute, please?
Thank you.

858
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,291
Now...

859
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:02,896
Alberto, give-a the package-a back
to the man. We gotta go home, it's late.

860
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:06,768
I cannot-a give him-a back the package.
Don't you see he is busy?

861
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:12,295
What do you mean, he's busy?
He's kissing her.

862
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:16,259
That's-a busy, no?
And he's doing a good job too.

863
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,416
- Well, we made it.
- I think.

864
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,775
Got you home safe and sound, didn't I?

865
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:30,738
All the fenders are still on.
Pretty good, isn't it?

866
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:33,778
Very good. Could you help
an old friend here?

867
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:37,057
Thank you.

868
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:40,132
I never really wanted to marry anyone,
not for a while.

869
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:44,498
I'm not just anyone, I'm an engaging
personality. Let's tell the family.

870
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:47,014
Don't take the edge off the birthday party.

871
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:50,172
Let Pop have his moment,
then we'll spring it.

872
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,409
OK.

873
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,094
We have lots to do
before Pop comes home.

874
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,136
Yeah, we got lots to do.

875
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:01,772
Hey, Pop's doing all right. Lot of loot here.

876
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:04,977
- I could use one of these.
- It's a real honey.

877
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:07,255
Break it up, boys, here they come.

878
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:11,697
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

879
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:14,977
For he's a jolly good fellow

880
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:17,096
Which nobody can deny

881
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,489
Which nobody can deny...

882
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,969
Happy birthday!

883
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,016
Look at that!

884
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,568
Oh, look at this!

885
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:30,572
W-W-W... What do I say?

886
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:33,777
Say the same thing I did when I saw it -
what is it?

887
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:36,897
It's a sound system, Jessie!
Don't you know?

888
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:39,938
- Music all over the house!
- Coming out of the walls.

889
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:42,773
- High fidelity!
- We all chipped in, Pop.

890
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:47,650
Oh, that tuner! The amplifier!
And look at that speaker. Three way!

891
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:51,699
It goes to 20,000 cycles.
You'll be able to hear those triangles now.

892
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:54,135
Sure, you're gonna be a real hep cat.

893
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:57,371
Hip. The word is "hip", Bob.
Only cubes say hep.

894
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,416
Wait a minute.

895
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:02,537
- Who's going to assemble this?
- Ernie!

896
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:05,339
- Well, of course, Ernie.
- Come on, Ernie.

897
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:07,376
Well, I guess I can handle it.

898
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:10,896
That's all high fidelity needs -
a good plumber.

899
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:15,138
And for when Ernie gets it glued together.

900
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,688
Immolation scene the soprano will love.

901
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,613
Wait till you hear the flames
licking her torso.

902
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:24,898
- That's not all, Dad. Here's some more.
- Handmade? Amy, you're a love.

903
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,414
Genuine cashmere.

904
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,014
Also handmade. Smoking jacket.

905
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,297
- Made from the sunroom curtains.
- Oh, Jessie!

906
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:38,530
- I happened to pass Tiffany's in New York.
- Tiffany's?

907
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:41,930
- Oh, Bob, that's too extravagant.
- It's a beauty.

908
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:45,615
It's Swiss, Pop.
Instead of chimes, it... yodels.

909
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,294
- There's something else.
- What's this?

910
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,735
- Barney!
- Uh?

911
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:54,539
You shouldn't have. It's very kind.

912
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:55,973
But I...

913
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,210
Try it on for size, Pop.

914
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:02,098
- Real sharp, huh?
- It looks wonderful on you.

915
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:03,329
Happy birthday, Dad.

916
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:05,809
- Laurie, I...
- I got it for you.

917
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:08,619
You don't mind, do you?

918
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,816
No. Thank you.

919
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:15,256
I guess that puts me in the same class
with Robert J Neary.

920
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,092
I know his kind like a book.

921
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:21,571
He's the "I sold newspapers as a kid
but look at me now" type.

922
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:25,335
- I have your type catalogued too, you know.
- Bet.

923
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,888
At a party you're the guy who always says,

924
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:31,052
"I never had a birthday party
or ever got a present."

925
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:33,096
- Right?
- I pay.

926
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,819
So, rather than let you be corny...

927
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,891
From me to you.

928
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,173
With initials too.

929
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,979
Hey, these are good links.

930
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:52,609
Of course, I do my shoplifting
at the finest stores.

931
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:56,409
All right, clear the decks!
Here comes the main event.

932
01:01:56,500 --> 01:02:00,049
- Watch yourself.
- Oh, man! That's a real beaut.

933
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:02,938
One candle? Now that's touching.

934
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,375
We're bribing you to stay young, Pop.

935
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:09,009
Oh, I'll accept the bribe
but there's no reason for it.

936
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:12,012
- Look at that cake!
- Did you bake it, Aunt Jessie?

937
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:16,013
- No, Fran did.
- In that case, I can't live without her.

938
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:18,330
We'll elope tonight, huh?

939
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:19,978
It's a date.

940
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:22,210
- Sure?
- Sure.

941
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,655
- Get those plates over here!
- Here we are.

942
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:26,298
Right, Pop, go to work.

943
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:29,172
Hurray!

944
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:34,334
All right. Every year on my birthday
I get sentimental and make a long speech

945
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,376
but this year I'm going to be brief

946
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:39,736
because I have more to be happy
about than ever before.

947
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:42,254
Oh, it's a perfectly beautiful speech.

948
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:44,456
Cut the cake.

949
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:47,532
- OK.
- Nice big piece for me.

950
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:49,770
You get the first one.

951
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,611
How about telling him now, huh?

952
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,656
- Do you think so?
- Sure, why not?

953
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,696
There a lull and, er...

954
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,738
I forgot to, er... show you this.

955
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:09,811
Alex, it's beautiful!

956
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:14,257
Quiet, everyone! Hold it down to a dull roar,
we have a commercial.

957
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:19,135
Alex and I are going to be married.

958
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:21,450
Married?

959
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,019
Uh-huh.

960
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:26,058
- How wonderful, Laurie.
- How about that!

961
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:28,700
It's great.
Sensational!

962
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:36,178
I surprised you, huh?
I'm marrying the wrong girl.

963
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:39,855
Have you set a date?
As soon as my laundry gets back.

964
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:43,649
It's been quite a day, hasn't it, Laurie?
First Pop, then you.

965
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:47,210
How about some coffee with this cake?
You haven't forgotten?

966
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,939
- It should be perking now.
- Let me help.

967
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:52,773
Amy, this marriage business
isn't contagious, is it?

968
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:55,454
- Let her get the coffee.
- That's a good idea.

969
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,132
Let's see it under the light.

970
01:03:57,220 --> 01:04:00,371
- I'm not sure if my daughter should marry...
- Oh... Isn't it?

971
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:03,372
<i>- ...a composer who doesn't do arranging.
- Yes, it is.</i>

972
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:06,930
You know, Laurie?
I think I'll beat you to the altar.

973
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:10,251
Fran!

974
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:13,093
Bob? You still want me to be a June bride?

975
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:14,932
Sure.

976
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:17,693
What did you say? Hey, Fran, you mean it?

977
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:20,772
- Hold this.
- Bring on marriage!

978
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:23,420
Hey, what's gotten into my family?

979
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:26,219
- I don't know what to say.
- Why say anything?

980
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:29,053
I propose a toast. A toast!
Come on, everyone.

981
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:32,815
- Let's make it to all of us.
- Punch for everybody.

982
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:45,379
If you put your head on my shoulder
they wouldn't hear you crying so loud.

983
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,576
I can't help it, Aunt Jessie.

984
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:50,936
- Someone else will come along.
- Oh, no, you're wrong.

985
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:54,296
They will. In about six months,
that's the usual time.

986
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:58,851
Don't contradict me.
I know about these things, being a spinster.

987
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:01,135
Aunt Jessie?

988
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:03,688
I have wonderful news. Bob and Franny...

989
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:11,850
- Amy? What's the matter, Amy?
- Nothing, nothing.

990
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:13,692
Why are you crying?

991
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:18,695
Amy can't get used to losing the baby
of the family any more than I can.

992
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:23,172
Oh, you mustn't feel like this.

993
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:26,650
I'm not going away.
Nothing will really change.

994
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:29,459
- I know, it's just...
- Amy...

995
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:32,373
we're all going to get married
sooner or later.

996
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:34,690
We are.

997
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:38,693
We'll have housefuls of kids
running all over the place.

998
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:42,216
Little violin players, little piano players.

999
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:47,695
Now, Amy, you like Alex, don't you?

1000
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:51,135
Of course she does, we all do.

1001
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:54,451
What is this, a taffy pull?
Come help me with the coffee.

1002
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:58,658
- She's right, I'm just being sensitive...
- Are you sure it isn't Alex?

1003
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:03,131
What I mean is, you never did seem
to take to him like the rest of us.

1004
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:07,213
Honest, Amy, he's so sweet
and he's so much fun.

1005
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:10,690
I... I know you'll learn to love him.

1006
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:13,499
Laurie, stop that gab-gab-gabbing.

1007
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:17,619
We need to get coffee to those people
or no one's going to love anyone.

1008
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:21,409
- Come on, darling.
- Amy, get those cups over there.

1009
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:26,528
Laurie, you pour. No, let me do it. At least
there's one steady hand in this family.

1010
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:32,333
Oh, dear. Oh...

1011
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:34,854
Let them come in and dunk it.

1012
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:55,296
Your coffee, Barney.

1013
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:26,218
It was just one of those things

1014
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:33,978
Just one of those crazy flings

1015
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:38,769
One of those bells

1016
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:42,648
That now and then rings

1017
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:46,574
Just one of those things

1018
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:53,132
It was just one of those nights

1019
01:07:55,380 --> 01:08:00,329
Just one of those fabulous flights

1020
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:07,177
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings

1021
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:12,776
Yes, it was one of those things

1022
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:18,457
If we thought a bit about the end of it

1023
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:24,091
When we started painting that town

1024
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:28,138
We'd have been aware

1025
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:34,136
That our love affair was too hot

1026
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:37,018
Not to cool down

1027
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:44,609
So goodbye, goodbye, bye-bye,
goodbye baby and amen

1028
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:49,932
Here's hoping we meet now and then

1029
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:55,172
It was great fun

1030
01:08:55,260 --> 01:09:05,738
But it was just one of those things

1031
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:27,933
What are you doing here?

1032
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:30,250
I could ask you the same question.

1033
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:32,535
And some more besides.

1034
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:35,816
Why haven't you been around lately?

1035
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,658
Is our piano out of tune or something?

1036
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,935
No, the pitch is fine.

1037
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:46,217
I guess I just don't have a beat
for The Wedding March.

1038
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:50,134
Oh. Is that why you didn't show up
at Franny's wedding?

1039
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:54,015
Well, I figured Alex can handle that.

1040
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:59,935
Today he'll probably play his own march
and say "I do" at the same time.

1041
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:04,856
I, er...

1042
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:07,738
Just waiting around.
A guy owes me some bucks.

1043
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:11,209
I don't feel like walking to New York.

1044
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:16,330
Barney, why are you going to New York?

1045
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:18,376
Just because I'm getting m...

1046
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:23,851
It's still no reason why I have to stop trying
to make a human being out of you.

1047
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:25,851
Hey.

1048
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:29,615
I brought chintz curtains into your life,
remember?

1049
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:33,978
- I'm not going to...
- Why do you have to look so beautiful?

1050
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:35,857
Who, me?

1051
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,170
You're getting married in an hour.

1052
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:43,012
Another dream shot.

1053
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:49,009
If that wasn't enough you come in here
looking like a convention of angels.

1054
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:52,888
Why does the sunlight
have to hit you just right?

1055
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:57,817
If your nose was shiny
or your eyes were dull -

1056
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,856
anything to make it easier.

1057
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:03,176
But look at you.

1058
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:08,050
Well, a girl can't get married
without a permanent, can't she?

1059
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:09,971
It wouldn't be legal.

1060
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:11,652
Nice going, honey.

1061
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:15,610
Congratulations.

1062
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:22,133
They take a guy out of the cold,
introduce him to a family of real people -

1063
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:24,939
Auntie Jessie, the old man -

1064
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:28,012
and then they throw a girl named
Laurie in his path.

1065
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:32,412
After she gets a hammer lock on his heart
they kick him out in the street.

1066
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,730
New lease on the gutter.

1067
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:36,299
Barney, listen to me.

1068
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:38,689
No. You listen to me.

1069
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:43,819
You've been telling me all along it's my fault,
that I didn't put up a battle.

1070
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:45,856
Well, now I'm full of fight.

1071
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:49,496
I love you, Laurie.

1072
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:53,939
I love you. Understand? Nobody gets you.

1073
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:55,772
Barney, please.

1074
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:01,736
Yes...

1075
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:05,895
Your theory's all cockeyed, baby.

1076
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:10,814
You got the judges and the referee
and I accept the verdict.

1077
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:14,368
What's more, I'll attend the wedding.

1078
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,530
My smile will be as brave as Amy's.

1079
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,491
Why Amy?

1080
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:25,131
Don't tell me you don't know
that she's got it real bad for Alex.

1081
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:28,337
- What are you talking about?
- Just what I said.

1082
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:33,255
When you're on the outside looking in
you can see things other people can't.

1083
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:37,015
- What do you mean?
- The night of the wedding announcement.

1084
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,136
Poor Amy, her face was white as a sheet.

1085
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:41,973
- She ran out of the room...
- That's not why...

1086
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:46,258
She came back in and her eyes were red
from crying and I knew why.

1087
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:51,334
- Cos I understand all the Amys of the world.
- But I know why she was crying.

1088
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:53,615
It was because I was getting married.

1089
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:56,658
- Amy and I have always been close and...
- Sure, sure.

1090
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,651
Barney, I don't believe you.

1091
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:02,528
- You're trying to frighten me.
- Look... Go home, get married.

1092
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:05,373
- People are waiting.
- You're lying!

1093
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:16,896
Sure.

1094
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:18,936
That's as good a word as any.

1095
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:23,979
Now, why don't you go,
I have an important business appointment.

1096
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:35,856
Go home.

1097
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:01,937
Amy? Amy?

1098
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:03,976
In here.

1099
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,249
Oh. Do me a favour, will you?

1100
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:09,978
Thanks.

1101
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:12,449
I would if I could, but I can't.

1102
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:15,213
My fingers are like jelly. Feel them.

1103
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:18,769
- Oh, they're cold.
- Yeah.

1104
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:20,816
So are yours.

1105
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:25,895
You know, some guys can tie knots,
some guys can't.

1106
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:28,210
Me, I can't tie anything.

1107
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:30,609
I know.

1108
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:34,380
- Hey, come on.
- Now just hold still.

1109
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:40,855
Hey, that's a steal from something.

1110
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:43,534
If it is it's a good one.

1111
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:45,497
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

1112
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:49,050
- Leave me some air to say "I do".
- I'm sorry.

1113
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:04,330
- There, I think I made it.
- Thanks.

1114
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:07,457
- How about me? Any price tags showing?
- Uh-uh.

1115
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:11,169
Striped trousers. Symbolic, eh?

1116
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:13,933
- How do I look?
- You look very nice.

1117
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:16,772
Thanks.

1118
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:21,735
You're my love. I'll see you.

1119
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,016
I'll see you.

1120
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:58,055
I understand that things like this...

1121
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:00,813
Pardon me, Reverend. What time have you?

1122
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:03,573
- 3:12.
- I have 3:08.

1123
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:05,890
- Gregory, what time have you?
- Huh?

1124
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:08,574
Oh. Er... 3:15.

1125
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,776
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

1126
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:13,657
Pardon me.

1127
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:17,733
- Are we gonna have ice cream?
- Sure, they always have it at weddings.

1128
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:20,857
- Have many weddings have you been to?
- Hundreds.

1129
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:24,296
- What do you think happened?
- She's probably out walking.

1130
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:27,497
All girls get wedding day nerves.
Didn't I take a walk?

1131
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,536
But Laurie - what possessed her?

1132
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:33,010
- It'll take 15 minutes to dress her.
- I know, I know.

1133
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,660
- Pop, what time did you say you had?
- Er...

1134
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:37,696
I told you. 3:15, Bob.

1135
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:43,934
- I wonder what the kitchen clock says.
- It says stop acting like a pompous idiot.

1136
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:45,976
I'm sorry.

1137
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:49,538
I say we break out
the champagne right now.

1138
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:52,976
My first wedding day,
I could use some muscle tone.

1139
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:55,779
That's probably Laurie now.

1140
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:58,294
Never mind, Amy, I'll get it.

1141
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:02,009
- Sign here.
- Aha, the wire we've been waiting for.

1142
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:04,011
Humperdinck Appliance Company.

1143
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:06,978
"You can't stay married
without a deep freeze.

1144
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:10,211
- "Our sale starts Monday. Easy terms."
- Yeah.

1145
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:13,178
- It's for you, Amy.
- For me?

1146
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:19,208
- It's from Laurie!
- Laurie?

1147
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:22,019
- Is something wrong?
- What happened?

1148
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,170
- Pop...
- What is it?

1149
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:28,136
Amy, what is it?

1150
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:31,530
She's married! Barney Sloan.

1151
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:39,579
"Break the news to Alex.
Make him understand this is for the best.

1152
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:43,369
"I found out just in time to avoid
making a terrible mistake.

1153
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:48,409
"Barney and I will be married by the time
this reaches you. Alex will understand..."

1154
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:53,776
Sorry, son.

1155
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:03,731
What are we going to do?

1156
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:07,651
Pop?

1157
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:12,576
Well, don't just stand there, do something.

1158
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:15,128
I can't go out and face all those people.

1159
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:18,494
Somebody has to tell them.

1160
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:20,536
I'll take care of it.

1161
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:38,852
I'm sorry, Reverend Johnson,
but the family wanted me to speak for them,

1162
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:41,534
to you and to their friends.

1163
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:58,290
"Break the news to Alex.
Make him understand this is for the best.

1164
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:01,735
"I found out just in time..."

1165
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:31,255
This quiet hurts my ears.

1166
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:34,298
I've only one in my orchestra now, Jess.

1167
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:37,417
You'll soon have the whole family
home for Christmas.

1168
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,889
I'm just writing jokes to Laurie about it.

1169
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:42,335
Well, let's take it from the top, Amy.

1170
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:46,618
But play loud, will you?
All I ask is a little noise.

1171
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:36,573
I guess there's no point in asking
how it's coming, is there?

1172
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:39,935
No, not much.

1173
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:45,937
- It's my turn now.
- What does that mean?

1174
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:47,976
I need your comfort.

1175
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:51,528
I burned the stew.

1176
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:56,211
Can't you salvage any of it?
Make a vegetable soup?

1177
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,734
The vegetables... disappeared.

1178
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:03,814
No matter. We'll get a decent meal
at your father's on Christmas.

1179
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,209
I guess that's why I burned the stew.

1180
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:09,337
I was reading Aunt Jessie's letter
over again.

1181
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:11,376
It gets better every time.

1182
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:15,416
Yeah.

1183
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:21,696
Come on, I'll walk you to work.

1184
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:25,739
- We'll eat on Joe again.
- Sure. Cold spaghetti and warm beer.

1185
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:29,493
Sometimes it's warm beer
and cold spaghetti.

1186
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:34,051
- He's fickle, that's all.
- But the music is great.

1187
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:37,291
Oh, that's ripped. Take it off and I'll fix it.

1188
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:42,329
There's a fella named Sloan
playing the piano there. Ever heard of him?

1189
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:44,570
Yeah, I heard of him.

1190
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,656
He's fair.

1191
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:50,896
What's that?

1192
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:53,971
Ever been to South America?

1193
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:57,057
No.

1194
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:59,131
Well, we nearly got there.

1195
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:02,900
- When?
- Yesterday.

1196
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:07,370
- You didn't tell me.
- I know.

1197
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:12,851
It was a good idea. Some of the guys
were going to put a combination together

1198
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:15,374
and go down there. Some place, any place.

1199
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:17,416
What happened?

1200
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:20,697
It takes money, sweetie,
everything takes money.

1201
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:23,772
300 bucks, one way, for two.

1202
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:31,898
In the old days you could've gone,
couldn't you?

1203
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:34,494
What are you saying?

1204
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:37,094
Two can't stow away as cheap as one.

1205
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:40,853
Forget it, I got an idea.

1206
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:43,659
- Why South America, Barney?
- Forget it!

1207
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:46,573
They've gone, they got a piano player.

1208
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:50,289
Besides it's summer down there now.
It's hot and it's green.

1209
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:52,132
They got tropical storms.

1210
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:59,818
Maybe I just wanted to give
South America's lightning a shot at me.

1211
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:02,698
- It's only fair.
- Please, not that again.

1212
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:05,613
Oh, where's your sense of humour?

1213
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:07,656
I'm sorry, honey.

1214
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:10,696
I was only kidding.

1215
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:16,420
That for South America.

1216
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,809
You haven't asked me what my idea is.

1217
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:26,216
- Laurie?
- Hm?

1218
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:31,135
You know how they say it in the songs,
don't you? "You'll never know how much"?

1219
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:34,780
How about you after all these months?

1220
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:37,851
You know how much.

1221
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:41,329
Crazy, mixed up character.

1222
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:45,777
- It's only four months too.
- Five.

1223
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:47,816
And you still love me?

1224
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:52,535
That's nice.

1225
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:56,295
I don't know though,
maybe you're the one that's crazy.

1226
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:01,053
- You said you had an idea.
- Yeah.

1227
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:04,371
I was thinking we ought to
live it up a little tonight.

1228
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:08,658
- Go out for a fancy dinner, Chinese maybe.
- Sounds very good.

1229
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:11,334
- What are we...?
- I got that figured out too.

1230
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:13,376
How much did we pay for the piano?

1231
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:16,018
- Oh...
- How much?

1232
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:19,490
- You know as well as I do it was $100.
- Good.

1233
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:24,415
Good, we can sell it back to this character
for 75, he can make himself $25.

1234
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:28,618
I'll starve first. You're going to finish
that song and on this piano.

1235
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,656
And a million more besides.

1236
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:34,415
I proved something, I finished three songs,
and on this piano.

1237
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:37,731
- Yes, and two were published.
- And both of them died.

1238
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:40,890
I'm no Alex Burke.

1239
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:44,211
No, you've got more talent than Alex.

1240
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:46,768
- Have I?
- Yes, you have.

1241
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:50,409
So how come he eats while he works?
We need eating money.

1242
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:52,775
- We'll get it too.
- How?

1243
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:54,930
I don't know how but we'll get it.

1244
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:59,935
Well, if we can't hock the piano,
is there anything else you have in mind?

1245
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:01,897
No, there's nothing else.

1246
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:04,811
Yes, there is.

1247
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:08,529
- What?
- That. The bracelet. His bracelet.

1248
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:10,850
Sure, why not?

1249
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:13,579
Unless you never got him
out of your system.

1250
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:18,017
As long as that's on your wrist
he's living with us. Maybe you want that.

1251
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:20,091
Well, hock it!

1252
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:24,731
I'm sick and tired of hearing about
Alex Burke and his success. Get rid of it.

1253
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:43,976
The funniest thing you've ever seen!

1254
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:47,814
After the third round, I asked Maxy
if he wanted to triple his bet -

1255
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:51,495
- you should've see his face!
- It's quarter to three

1256
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:57,132
There's no one in the place
'cept you and me

1257
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:02,372
So set 'em up, Joe

1258
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:08,296
I got a little story you ought to know

1259
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:14,617
We're drinking, my friend

1260
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:19,615
To the end of a brief episode

1261
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:26,292
So make it one for my baby

1262
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:31,771
And one more for the road

1263
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:38,853
I got the routine

1264
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:44,298
Put another nickel in the machine

1265
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:50,856
I'm feeling so bad

1266
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:58,335
Won't you make the music easy and sad

1267
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:02,776
I could tell you a lot

1268
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:09,333
But you've got to be true to your code

1269
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:14,254
So make it one for my baby

1270
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:20,892
And one more for the road

1271
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:29,134
You'd never know it but, buddy,
I'm a kind of poet

1272
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:34,852
And I got a lot of things to say

1273
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:38,852
And when I'm gloomy

1274
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:42,091
You simply gotta listen to me

1275
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:47,935
Till it's all talked away

1276
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:53,659
Well, that's how it goes

1277
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:57,850
- And Joe I know you're getting...
- Good evening, Mrs Sloan.

1278
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:00,852
<i>- ...anxious to close
- Table down there.</i>

1279
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:06,533
So thanks for the cheer

1280
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:13,776
I hope you didn't mind
my bending your ear

1281
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:21,768
But this torch that I found
must be drowned

1282
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:25,409
Or it soon might explode

1283
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:31,255
So make it one for my baby

1284
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:36,299
And one more for the road

1285
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:40,371
The long

1286
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:47,974
That long road

1287
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:12,973
- Nice of you to pick us up, Ernie.
- Orders. Amy's orders.

1288
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:18,578
- Amy still bossing you around, Ern?
- And it'll get worse after we're married.

1289
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:21,777
- You and Amy?
- You bet. Soon too.

1290
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:31,779
Come on.

1291
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:34,613
Stick close, honey, I'm going to need you.

1292
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:36,736
Laurie...

1293
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:40,050
I almost forgot this.

1294
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:44,852
Don't ask me how I got it.
It might be embarrassing.

1295
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:48,410
Yes? Laurie!

1296
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:51,651
Darling, good to see you.

1297
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:55,210
Hello, Barney, I'm awfully glad
you could make it.

1298
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:58,775
Aunt Jessie!

1299
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:02,250
Oh, you look so wonderful.
Doesn't she, Barney?

1300
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:05,298
- Hello, Barney. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1301
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:09,373
- Come in, you must be frozen.
- Hey, Laurie, I'm waiting for a hug!

1302
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:11,416
Merry Christmas, sweetheart!

1303
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:16,539
- Oh, the tree is beautiful.
- You really like it? I'm so glad.

1304
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:20,772
- How did you do it without me?
- It was kinda hard, but we managed.

1305
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:23,454
Honey, it's so good to see you.

1306
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:25,496
Number Nine!

1307
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:31,013
Oh, that's a good boy. You're such
a sweet doggy, I missed you so much.

1308
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:35,491
- Hey, you're getting fat. Isn't he?
- He's been eating regularly.

1309
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:37,696
Oh, I love you.

1310
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:46,376
Hiya, Tuttle.

1311
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:49,496
Hiya, Burke.

1312
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:54,654
- Alex, come and join the party.
- Stop making like a big composer.

1313
01:30:54,740 --> 01:31:00,019
- How's he been since the show, Pop?
- He wears his royalty cheques on his lapel!

1314
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:04,252
I haven't collected a penny!
We're still in Philadelphia.

1315
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:08,253
- You know, art, the theatre.
- He's a big hit, Laurie.

1316
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:12,538
- We need to make it in New York.
- And all those critics.

1317
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:15,373
Don't say that! They'll love it.

1318
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:22,215
Merry Christmas, Barney.

1319
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:25,975
Same to you. And congratulations,
I read your Philly notices.

1320
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:30,895
- Your orchestrating helped a lot.
- You helped cover up what he stole!

1321
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:34,734
You'll feel better after your dinner.
Oh, there's a bird in the oven.

1322
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:37,778
Attagirl, Aunt Jessie, keep it practical.

1323
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:40,818
Wait a minute, Amy.
Why waste good mistletoe?

1324
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:44,097
Attaboy, Ernie! Come up for air!

1325
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:47,375
Go man, go. That gives me an idea.

1326
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:49,337
Come on, sweetheart.

1327
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:55,579
- Oh, come on, Fran.
- Pop? I've waited a long time for this.

1328
01:31:55,660 --> 01:31:57,412
Move over.

1329
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:01,537
- Oh!
- Tuttle, the Latin lover.

1330
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:05,410
- Dinner!
- Aww.

1331
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:09,379
Hold it, hold it.
We don't need any mistletoe, do we?

1332
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:12,293
- No.
- OK, shoulders back, chin up.

1333
01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:14,496
- Ready?
- Yes.

1334
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:19,328
- Well, thank you. Let's go to dinner.
- Oh, turkey!

1335
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:33,172
- This is the second act ballad.
- What a good dinner...

1336
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:35,774
- Shhh!
- Oh, sorry, Alex, but it was good.

1337
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:38,613
You're right, it was. Would you sing, Laurie?

1338
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:40,691
- Sure.
- I want to go on record,

1339
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:43,613
before the critics tear us apart - I like it.

1340
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:48,051
- OK?
- OK.

1341
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:56,732
So what, it's raining

1342
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:59,618
It won't help complaining

1343
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:05,855
The fundamental rules of nature still apply

1344
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:10,411
Look up at the sky

1345
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:16,809
There's a rising moon

1346
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:24,248
For every falling star

1347
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:28,652
Makes no difference

1348
01:33:28,740 --> 01:33:37,330
Just how sad or blue you are

1349
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:44,017
One never knows about tomorrow

1350
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:49,570
Just what another day may bring

1351
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:57,099
One moment in your heart it's winter

1352
01:33:57,180 --> 01:34:04,860
Comes a rose and suddenly it's spring

1353
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:11,890
There'll be times of sorrow

1354
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:18,453
There'll be times of joy

1355
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:24,011
And a bright tomorrow

1356
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:29,777
For each girl and boy

1357
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:37,413
Who knows what happiness is made

1358
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:44,850
Just a kiss away from where you are

1359
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:52,812
There's a rising moon

1360
01:34:53,900 --> 01:35:06,415
For every falling star

1361
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:11,417
- Wonderful, Alex!
- Very nice piece.

1362
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:16,415
- Play it again!
- I'd like to but I'd miss my train.

1363
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:20,015
- Oh, that's a shame.
- I was lucky to get Christmas Eve off

1364
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:22,375
but the actors are working. Aunt Jessie.

1365
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:26,135
- There was a show tonight?
- And tomorrow. We won't get an audience.

1366
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:28,688
In Philadelphia,
anything can happen.

1367
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:30,452
- I'll get your coat.
- Thanks.

1368
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:33,338
- Ernie, get Alex's bags.
- Yeah, hop to it, now.

1369
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:36,014
I heard of henpecked husbands,
but fiancs?

1370
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:39,251
Can't you miss your train?

1371
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:43,891
No one will believe you're a real composer
if you show up at every rehearsal.

1372
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:48,531
- Can I help it if I like good music?
- Good music? Let's send him away happy.

1373
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:53,255
- Thanks.
- I think this is yours.

1374
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:57,219
If it doesn't fit, it's mine.

1375
01:35:57,300 --> 01:36:00,576
Whoever said "out of sight, out of mind"
was a liar.

1376
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:06,496
Alex, I haven't had a chance
to talk to you all evening.

1377
01:36:06,580 --> 01:36:11,176
- There's something I'd like to explain.
- You don't have to explain anything.

1378
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:14,093
All I want to know is... are you happy, Laurie?

1379
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:17,171
I love him very much.

1380
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:20,768
You still haven't answered me.

1381
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:25,258
Alex, I put something in your pocket.

1382
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:41,528
I guess that answers my question.

1383
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:06,456
You know something?
Marriage certainly agrees with you.

1384
01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:08,815
For a wife you're darned pretty.

1385
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:12,373
- For a mother I'm darned pretty.
- Mother?

1386
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:14,690
- I'm going to have a baby, Alex.
- No!

1387
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:17,089
- Yes.
- Oh, that's wonderful news.

1388
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:20,410
I'm glad. For you.

1389
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:24,454
It was a tough fight, Ma, but we lost.

1390
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:27,737
I might also add, we was robbed.

1391
01:37:27,820 --> 01:37:32,132
- I better congratulate Barney.
- Oh, no. No, don't. He doesn't know yet.

1392
01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:34,654
- What?
- I found out myself yesterday.

1393
01:37:34,740 --> 01:37:39,495
I'm saving the announcement for midnight.
It's my Christmas present to him.

1394
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:43,016
- It's better than cuff links, don't you think?
- Yeah.

1395
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:47,890
I don't know what Barney will give you back,
but it'll never match it.

1396
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:49,936
Or you.

1397
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:54,772
Well...

1398
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:56,816
I guess you better hurry, huh?

1399
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:59,573
Yeah, I guess I'd better.

1400
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:02,491
So long, Burke.

1401
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:04,616
So long... Sloan.

1402
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:07,897
- Well, just in time.
- All set to go, Alex?

1403
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:11,370
- Yeah.
- I'll drive you to the station. It's no trouble.

1404
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:14,770
Would you drop me at the drugstore
to get some cigarettes?

1405
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:16,930
Well, Jessie, here we go again.

1406
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:24,179
Can I drive Alex to the station?
Some private stuff we need to discuss.

1407
01:38:24,260 --> 01:38:28,378
Fine with me. I'll get you your cigarettes
and some cigars for myself.

1408
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:31,372
- You can pick me up on the way back.
- Goodbye!

1409
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:33,815
Let's go, we haven't got much time.

1410
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:36,619
- Goodbye, Alex!
- Goodbye!

1411
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:38,656
- Get in, Alex.
- Let's go.

1412
01:38:55,420 --> 01:38:58,935
I asked Bob to let me
drive you to the station because I...

1413
01:38:59,020 --> 01:39:01,614
I wanted to say sorry for messing things up.

1414
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:06,171
- It's ancient history. Forget it.
- Busting things up. That's my speed.

1415
01:39:06,260 --> 01:39:10,811
One saving grace though.
I always wind up at the bottom of the pile.

1416
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:13,289
How have things been going for you?

1417
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:15,848
- Not too bad.
- Working?

1418
01:39:15,940 --> 01:39:17,896
Yeah, here and there.

1419
01:39:17,980 --> 01:39:21,450
- Everything's all right, then.
- Why not?

1420
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:23,292
Oh, I ran into Jake last week -

1421
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:27,168
he was on his way to South America
and we got to talking about you.

1422
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:30,093
- He said...
- Jake's a bigger liar than I am.

1423
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:34,456
- Do me a favour, Barney?
- Ha. How much do you need?

1424
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:38,135
I've been lucky lately.
Let me lend you some, tide you over.

1425
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:44,135
If you ever get tired of being a nice guy,
Alex... It would bore me stiff.

1426
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:47,018
- No, I can't take it, Alex.
- Why not?

1427
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:50,775
Who knows? Maybe it's because
I'm a new man.

1428
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:54,455
Or so they tell me.
The old Barney would've taken it.

1429
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:56,770
The old Barney was no dope.

1430
01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:11,970
- Porter?
- Yes, sir?

1431
01:40:17,020 --> 01:40:20,012
Thanks for the lift, Barney.
And Merry Christmas.

1432
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:23,172
- 'Board!
- Oh, Barney...

1433
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:26,692
- Here.
- Wait a minute...

1434
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:30,250
For Laurie. Use it, any way
you think will make her happy.

1435
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:35,212
Merry Christmas, Barney.

1436
01:40:42,420 --> 01:40:45,776
Yeah. Merry Christmas.

1437
01:42:39,660 --> 01:42:41,969
Oh, I think it's wonderful, Amy.

1438
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:44,335
- Have you set the date, yet?
- No.

1439
01:42:44,420 --> 01:42:46,854
- Pretty soon, I hope.
- That's nice.

1440
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:50,535
Isn't it funny how everything's worked out?
One short year.

1441
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:52,372
Remember last Christmas?

1442
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:56,453
You weren't married,
Fran wasn't married and Alex...

1443
01:42:56,540 --> 01:43:00,055
- Go ahead.
- You don't mind if I talk about him?

1444
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:02,051
Of course not.

1445
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:04,938
You know, you won't believe this, but...

1446
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:07,976
I thought I was in love with Alex.

1447
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:12,218
- Really?
- Well, I guess we all did.

1448
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:15,815
Then your telegram came
and we all fell apart.

1449
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:20,496
Everybody except Ernie.
I'll never forget the way he took hold.

1450
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:23,333
He was so calm and dignified.

1451
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:25,490
I guess that's when it all started.

1452
01:43:26,580 --> 01:43:30,095
- You and the romantic plumber?
- Yes.

1453
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:33,695
You know, Laurie, it's funny
how you can be around somebody

1454
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:36,010
and not know how much they mean to you.

1455
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:37,852
You and Barney for instance.

1456
01:43:37,940 --> 01:43:42,536
You couldn't have known how much
you loved him when you first married him.

1457
01:43:42,620 --> 01:43:44,690
I know now.

1458
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:50,298
Amy, I love him so much
and yet I can't convince him that I do. Really.

1459
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:54,578
But you married him.
Doesn't that prove that you love him?

1460
01:43:55,660 --> 01:43:59,938
It doesn't. He thinks he's a failure
and nobody wants him.

1461
01:44:01,020 --> 01:44:04,251
He stays in the outside, Amy.
I can't bring him close.

1462
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:07,650
Oh, darling.
Everything's going to be all right.

1463
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:10,857
You just know that it is.
With the baby and all?

1464
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:14,853
Now, could you imagine Barney as a father?

1465
01:44:14,940 --> 01:44:18,250
- No.
- Everything's going to be wonderful.

1466
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:19,978
I hope so.

1467
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:23,655
Oh, no!

1468
01:44:23,740 --> 01:44:26,334
It's Bob. He's had an accident.

1469
01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:28,695
Will you be quiet a minute, please?

1470
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:33,693
St Joseph's Hospital. Right... Yes?

1471
01:44:34,780 --> 01:44:37,692
I'll bring his wife with me.

1472
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:41,216
- Is he badly hurt?
- Yes, Fran, I'm sorry.

1473
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:44,929
- The car's outside.
- Amy, Laurie, get the coats.

1474
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:47,250
Pop. Oh, Pop.

1475
01:44:54,420 --> 01:44:56,490
Put this around you, Jess.

1476
01:44:58,460 --> 01:45:01,054
Poor Bob, I... I never made him happy.

1477
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:06,372
- I didn't even try.
- Fran, you mustn't say that.

1478
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:09,816
He's always been... so kind, so generous.

1479
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:15,928
- I never showed any appreciation.
- You can make it up to him. He'll be OK.

1480
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:19,535
- But suppose he's... Suppose he...
- Franny, please.

1481
01:45:36,940 --> 01:45:39,374
Fran...

1482
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:43,296
It isn't Bob.

1483
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:46,972
Laurie...

1484
01:45:47,060 --> 01:45:48,778
It's Barney.

1485
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:50,976
He was driving Bob's car.

1486
01:45:58,860 --> 01:46:02,489
Barney... Barney.

1487
01:46:06,220 --> 01:46:09,292
- Laurie...
- Yes, darling?

1488
01:46:12,220 --> 01:46:15,417
They wouldn't even let me go out in style.

1489
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:23,974
Have you got a cigarette?

1490
01:46:25,060 --> 01:46:26,413
Yes.

1491
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:32,850
You're going to be fine.

1492
01:46:35,860 --> 01:46:38,420
Only lightning can get you.

1493
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:41,139
You gave me your word, remember?

1494
01:46:41,220 --> 01:46:44,053
Lightning can be manufactured, you know.

1495
01:46:50,620 --> 01:46:54,852
- He needs rest now.
- Doctor, is he going to be all right?

1496
01:46:58,100 --> 01:47:01,297
- Is he?
- Please, Mrs Sloan...

1497
01:47:02,060 --> 01:47:04,255
No!

1498
01:47:04,340 --> 01:47:06,979
Barney, I won't let you quit.

1499
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:10,016
You can't.

1500
01:47:12,780 --> 01:47:16,136
Darling, I love you so much and I need you.

1501
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:20,733
Please...

1502
01:47:20,820 --> 01:47:23,209
We need you.

1503
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:27,292
Barney... Barney...

1504
01:47:29,660 --> 01:47:31,571
We're going to have a baby.

1505
01:47:33,260 --> 01:47:35,979
Barney, can you hear me?

1506
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:38,051
I'm going to have a baby.

1507
01:47:40,140 --> 01:47:44,099
Barney... Barney, I won't let you give up.

1508
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:49,856
Barney!

1509
01:48:58,180 --> 01:48:59,977
Look!

1510
01:49:01,060 --> 01:49:03,051
Happy Easter, Lightning.

1511
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:07,291
My love

1512
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:12,613
Is ever you, my love

1513
01:49:14,060 --> 01:49:22,092
Now and forever you, my love

1514
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:29,858
You walked into my lonely world

1515
01:49:30,940 --> 01:49:39,018
What peace of mind your smile unfurled

1516
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:49,533
Yes, and because of you, my love

1517
01:49:49,620 --> 01:49:57,618
My wishful dreams came true, my love

1518
01:49:58,700 --> 01:50:02,056
In my uncertain heart

1519
01:50:03,140 --> 01:50:09,010
I am only certain of

1520
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:14,777
How much I love you

1521
01:50:16,260 --> 01:50:20,697
My love

1522
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:26,939
It's got a face and feet now.
How do you like it?

1523
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:29,215
It's just wonderful.

1524
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:32,295
Come on in and join the family.

1525
01:50:35,900 --> 01:50:43,170
Yes, and because of you, my love

1526
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:52,611
My wishful dreams came true, my love

1527
01:50:53,700 --> 01:50:58,216
In my uncertain heart

1528
01:50:58,300 --> 01:51:04,011
I am only certain of

1529
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:11,051
How much I love you

1530
01:51:12,140 --> 01:51:19,171
My love

1531
01:51:20,660 --> 01:51:25,017
- That's what I call real moving.
- I'm in love with my wife all over again.

1532
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:27,295
It's beautiful.

1533
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:30,690
- I'm so happy.
- Lightnin', congratulate your poppa.

1534
01:51:32,620 --> 01:51:34,770
- There you go.
- Come over here.

1535
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:39,490
Fairy tales can come true

1536
01:51:39,580 --> 01:51:42,617
It can happen to you

1537
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:46,136
If you're young at heart

1538
01:51:48,260 --> 01:51:51,013
For it's hard, you will find

1539
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:53,773
To be narrow of mind

1540
01:51:53,860 --> 01:51:57,136
If you're young at heart

1541
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:02,138
And if you should survive

1542
01:52:02,220 --> 01:52:04,575
To a hundred and five

1543
01:52:04,660 --> 01:52:07,538
Look at all you'll derive

1544
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:10,373
Out of being alive

1545
01:52:10,460 --> 01:52:13,133
And here is the best part

1546
01:52:13,220 --> 01:52:16,018
You have a head start

1547
01:52:16,100 --> 01:52:21,220
If you are among the very young at heart
