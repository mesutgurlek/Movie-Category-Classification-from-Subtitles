1
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,428
New York city..

2
00:00:16,759 --> 00:00:18,960
Not a land far far away..

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,758
But still one of the most magical cities in the world.

4
00:00:21,878 --> 00:00:23,595
Its streets buzzing with people and..

5
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:26,176
Buildings that seem to go on forever.

6
00:00:26,697 --> 00:00:29,433
It's a kind of place where fairytales
seem to be possible..

7
00:00:29,553 --> 00:00:30,957
No matter who you are.

8
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:35,141
This isn't one of your typical
Cinderella story..

9
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:37,204
There are no pumpkin,
no mice..

10
00:00:37,324 --> 00:00:38,482
No Cinderella.

11
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:40,616
Or at least not the one
you're used to.

12
00:00:41,407 --> 00:00:42,540
Meet Charlie.

13
00:00:42,855 --> 00:00:44,800
He was young when he lost his mom.

14
00:00:44,842 --> 00:00:47,458
Leaving him with Art,
his step father.

15
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:48,772
And then there's these two.

16
00:00:48,803 --> 00:00:50,063
Charlie's stepbrothers.

17
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:52,341
Who are just a litte..
How do i say this..

18
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:53,614
Annoying.

19
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:57,627
Now Charlie stucks cleaning the place
his mom once owned.

20
00:00:58,424 --> 00:00:59,606
Wait, wait.

21
00:01:00,387 --> 00:01:02,951
Before we lay our fairytale play out,
you should know..

22
00:01:02,994 --> 00:01:04,660
Charlie has a talent.

23
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,877
A real gift from music.

24
00:01:06,919 --> 00:01:08,573
Yo, come out!

25
00:01:48,263 --> 00:01:49,856
And this is where i come in.

26
00:01:50,038 --> 00:01:50,922
Like i said..

27
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,158
This is a fairytale
with a twist.

28
00:01:53,194 --> 00:01:54,824
I'm no fairy godmother.

29
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,290
But Charlie has a dream.

30
00:01:56,338 --> 00:01:58,326
And all he needs is someone
to hear him.

31
00:01:58,356 --> 00:01:59,695
And open a door.

32
00:02:03,025 --> 00:02:04,819
It's just water.
Come on, people!

33
00:02:09,826 --> 00:02:11,074
Keep it up, man.

34
00:02:11,268 --> 00:02:13,528
Next time i see you,
you better be in an album cover.

35
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:17,672
Thank you.

36
00:02:19,924 --> 00:02:20,923
Who knows?

37
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:23,933
Maybe one day, you'll be as famous as she is.

38
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,890
And that's the beauty of this city.

39
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,925
You never know
what's gonna happen next.

40
00:02:35,307 --> 00:02:37,927
Just around the corner, there could be
something amazing.

41
00:02:38,193 --> 00:02:39,532
Or someone.

42
00:03:36,475 --> 00:03:37,281
What?

43
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:38,486
What's up?

44
00:03:40,248 --> 00:03:41,562
Cut, cut!

45
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:43,786
What's wrong with playback?

46
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:45,246
Working on it, boss.

47
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:47,633
I don't know, this computer had
a panic attack or something.

48
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:48,401
Unreal.

49
00:03:48,425 --> 00:03:50,812
Just give me a minute.
-Everyone take 10.

50
00:03:55,678 --> 00:03:56,678
Trumpet!

51
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,624
Get that dog off of my couture!

52
00:04:01,872 --> 00:04:04,296
Why can't you have a
purse-sized dog..

53
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,401
Like all of the other stars?

54
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:09,021
This horse dog doesn't fit your image.

55
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:11,021
Trumpet doesn't care about my image.

56
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:13,242
He loves the real me,
and i love him.

57
00:04:13,297 --> 00:04:15,248
Isn't that right, boy?
Isn't that right..

58
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:16,633
Should i rub your belly?

59
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:18,026
Should i rub our miss' belly?

60
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:20,933
No one touches my belly.

61
00:04:36,003 --> 00:04:36,857
Hey!

62
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,243
Grilled cheese with pickles,
on rye.

63
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:40,878
You are the best, Martha.

64
00:04:40,926 --> 00:04:43,755
If it weren't for Diego,
i would propose to you right now.

65
00:04:43,804 --> 00:04:46,325
That'd be great, maybe she'll stop bugging me for a bigger ring.

66
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:47,652
Hah! This guy..

67
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:50,720
He brings me stuff he finds in the streets,
everyday.

68
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:52,641
Why don't you find me a ring in the street?

69
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:54,589
And maybe some customers.
-Customers..

70
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:55,928
That's what we need.

71
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:59,195
If your mom only knew Arthur turns
this place into a ghost town.

72
00:04:59,686 --> 00:05:01,243
I should do something about it.

73
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,915
Diego's not gonna have to do anything.

74
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:05,746
Cause things are not gonna be like this
for much longer.

75
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:07,987
Really? Alright, Charlie..

76
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,527
You got a little plan brewing?

77
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:14,930
Nope, i got nothing.

78
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,577
I can barely move in this outift.

79
00:05:19,898 --> 00:05:21,570
You look amazing.

80
00:05:22,193 --> 00:05:23,193
Thanks, girl.

81
00:05:23,368 --> 00:05:26,277
It's the latest design by GG le Tron.

82
00:05:26,397 --> 00:05:28,022
What about GG le Normal?

83
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:29,810
GG le Clothing Wearable by Human?

84
00:05:29,852 --> 00:05:32,063
Can't we put any outfits from
anyone like that?

85
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,454
There's my girl.

86
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:35,551
Daddy!
-Kadee, MTV!

87
00:05:35,593 --> 00:05:38,023
I didn't think you'd make it.
-No hugging, it'll wrinkle!

88
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:40,022
I think she'd survive a wrinkle or two.
Come here.

89
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:43,468
That's what i'm going to say. Go for it.
You only live once.

90
00:05:43,588 --> 00:05:46,681
The biggest star of Majesty Records,
and i remember when she was singing in diapers.

91
00:05:47,044 --> 00:05:48,007
How's the shoot?

92
00:05:48,062 --> 00:05:48,831
You're killing it?

93
00:05:48,855 --> 00:05:50,874
The only thing getting killed
are my feet.

94
00:05:50,994 --> 00:05:52,419
It's going fine.

95
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:54,137
Can i talk to you, please?
-Yeah.

96
00:05:54,325 --> 00:05:57,470
Hey guys, why don't you get a shot of that set,
that i'm paying so much money for?

97
00:06:01,813 --> 00:06:03,068
What's up?
-Daddy..

98
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:05,047
Don't you think these all
is a little..

99
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:06,217
Much?

100
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:08,196
Like maybe i should be singing my own stuff.

101
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:09,347
I don't know if that's the best idea..

102
00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:11,195
Best idea, jinx!

103
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,792
Sweety..

104
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,742
I just want you to be protected.

105
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:17,432
That's why i get you the best songwriter
money can buy.

106
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,715
Don't worry.

107
00:06:18,835 --> 00:06:20,163
Your new single is gonna be a hit.

108
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:21,294
Trust me.

109
00:06:24,696 --> 00:06:26,248
I got to take this, ok?

110
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:28,522
We're announcing the talent search today.

111
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:37,176
Kadee, your dog is chewing
on the microphone.

112
00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:41,869
Trumpet, that microphone is not
a dog bone!

113
00:07:15,623 --> 00:07:17,283
These are different from the ones i like.

114
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,193
Look, it's MTV.

115
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:22,307
Kadee, after 6 number 1s..

116
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:24,044
Kadee!

117
00:07:24,092 --> 00:07:25,910
Hate these clothes so much..

118
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,613
Why can't they all see?

119
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,236
The more i go through,
i don't want to..

120
00:07:30,636 --> 00:07:32,580
Just want to be me.

121
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:52,279
Who do you think you are?

122
00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:54,874
I don't pay you to waste your time.

123
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:56,964
Actually, you don't pay me at all.

124
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,677
Are you sassing me, Charlie?

125
00:07:58,744 --> 00:07:59,677
No sir.

126
00:07:59,797 --> 00:08:00,598
Good.

127
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:05,140
My mom used to let me sing whatever i..
-Your mom..

128
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:07,178
Not only left me in charge of you, but..

129
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:09,939
Also of this dump which i also have to run.

130
00:08:10,278 --> 00:08:11,599
It's time to open.

131
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,667
Let's go.

132
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:14,575
Are you guys open yet?

133
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:17,150
Not quite, but..

134
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,543
We have a special treat for you,
Charlie!

135
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,786
Why don't you introduce the opening act?

136
00:08:21,822 --> 00:08:23,209
Ladies and gentlemen..

137
00:08:23,262 --> 00:08:25,365
Please give it up
for Andrew and Lloyd.

138
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:27,315
That's Androyd!

139
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,090
When you combine Andrew and Lloyd..

140
00:08:31,114 --> 00:08:32,374
Androyd.

141
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,366
I hate you so much, Lloyd.

142
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,626
Ouch, harsh much?

143
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:46,878
Yeah!

144
00:08:59,742 --> 00:09:00,548
My boys!

145
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,045
We're submitting a CD for the Majesty Records' talent seach..

146
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:23,204
The search is over, am i right
or am i right?

147
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:29,754
I'm hit!

148
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:31,826
Andrew!

149
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,326
Do you take requests?

150
00:09:38,296 --> 00:09:39,435
Hi!
-Hello!

151
00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:40,610
Kadee, hi!

152
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,487
How are you?
-Let's go, it's the fans.

153
00:09:44,088 --> 00:09:47,872
Lovelies.. You got pens and stuff,
this is great.

154
00:09:47,908 --> 00:09:50,095
Thank you.
-Oh, you want a hug?

155
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,916
Thank you, you're beautiful.

156
00:09:52,013 --> 00:09:53,097
How are you?

157
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:54,475
Can we just get through this?

158
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,256
Remember, we agree to keep
this one short.

159
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:57,813
But they love us,
look at it!

160
00:09:58,313 --> 00:09:59,282
No?

161
00:10:00,148 --> 00:10:01,874
Alright, fine.

162
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,461
Let's go.

163
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:08,127
You look fantastic, you both look amazing.
-Thanks.

164
00:10:08,247 --> 00:10:11,452
Let's do a couple of photoes.
-Finn, Kadee, over here!

165
00:10:11,572 --> 00:10:13,558
How about a kiss?
-Alright.

166
00:10:13,678 --> 00:10:15,712
You better show this one, boys!

167
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:19,556
Oh yeah, that's good.

168
00:10:19,676 --> 00:10:22,955
Could you move over a bit?
I just want the light to hit my cheekbones.

169
00:10:23,075 --> 00:10:24,739
Cheers, thanks love.

170
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,685
It's actually clean.

171
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,185
So am i free to go?
-Yes.

172
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,938
Free to go drop off Androyd's
demo CD..

173
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:44,167
Into Majesty Records for the talent search.

174
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,324
Androyd has a CD?

175
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:47,914
Are you jealous, Charlie?

176
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:49,543
You should be.

177
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:51,818
But don't worry,
when they're number 1..

178
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:53,856
You can clean the dressing room.

179
00:10:54,368 --> 00:10:57,996
That's a relief, for a second there i thought
you were gonna say something really mean.

180
00:10:58,685 --> 00:11:00,781
Don't forget, curfew is midnight!

181
00:11:01,114 --> 00:11:02,326
Can't wait!

182
00:11:07,603 --> 00:11:10,117
Kadee, look over here.
-Thank you.

183
00:11:11,646 --> 00:11:12,949
You are great.

184
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:15,536
I think i'm gonna walk today, Tony.

185
00:11:15,581 --> 00:11:17,944
Get some fresh air.
-You're father won't like this.

186
00:11:18,064 --> 00:11:20,990
He also wouldn't like you're using his Nicks tickets without him knowing.

187
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,690
Enjoy the park.
-See you.

188
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,526
Come on, Trumpet.
-You take care of her.

189
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,274
Trumpet!

190
00:11:28,317 --> 00:11:30,241
I love you too.

191
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:34,251
Come on!

192
00:11:35,714 --> 00:11:38,081
Sorry, here sorry..
-Sorry.

193
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,144
Sorry.

194
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:41,953
Oh no.

195
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:44,741
Trumpet!

196
00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:47,061
Hey, do you mind?
That's private.

197
00:11:49,394 --> 00:11:50,761
Kadee Worth?

198
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:53,961
You're Kadee Worth, like the Kadee Worth
Kadee Worth.

199
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:56,881
Please, can i have that back?
-Yeah, sure.

200
00:11:57,922 --> 00:11:59,579
Sorry, i..

201
00:12:01,246 --> 00:12:02,960

Mom, i can't talk,

00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:30,722
Wait, part-time janitor job?

210
00:12:30,842 --> 00:12:32,288

00:12:39,153 --> 00:12:41,399
Yes, yes i do.

215
00:12:42,538 --> 00:12:44,162
Majesty Records.

216
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,008
I thought i was supposed to see you
on an album cover, what happened?

217
00:12:48,128 --> 00:12:50,907
You saw me play in the streets the other day.
-Yeah.

218
00:12:51,027 --> 00:12:54,269
Do you work here?
-Yup, studio engineer.

219
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:57,464
And you want to work here as..

220
00:12:57,584 --> 00:12:59,032
A janitor?

221
00:12:59,152 --> 00:13:01,658
Ever since i was a little boy,
i've just wanted to scrub toilets.

222
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:03,455
I can see how that beats
playing music.

223
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:06,390
Do you ever play?
-Yeah, i played the streets..

224
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,586
Barmitzvah,
Botmitzvah..

225
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:10,826
Any mitzvah you can book, really.

226
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,582
That's all behind me now.

227
00:13:13,037 --> 00:13:14,065
Shawn.

228
00:13:14,185 --> 00:13:15,148
Charlie.

229
00:13:16,064 --> 00:13:17,185
Don't work too hard.

230
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:19,504
I always work too hard.

231
00:13:21,806 --> 00:13:23,343
Do me a favor, would you?

232
00:13:23,843 --> 00:13:25,098
Make sure he gets hired.

233
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:27,741
Will you go on a date with me?
-No.

234
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:30,183
I'll still do it.

235
00:13:35,842 --> 00:13:38,422
Stupid boy, right Trumpet?

236
00:13:39,505 --> 00:13:41,164
Not a total loss.

237
00:14:24,637 --> 00:14:25,801
It's her.

238
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,445
It's her!
It is!

239
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:30,606
Kadee Worth!
Mom, it's Kadee Worth!

240
00:14:30,644 --> 00:14:32,234
It's Kadee Worth!

241
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,491
Thanks a lot, trumpet.

242
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:35,417
I love you!

243
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:37,436
Can i get a picture with you?
-Sure.

244
00:14:37,593 --> 00:14:39,145
Mom, take my picture.

245
00:14:42,194 --> 00:14:43,364
Thank you!

246
00:14:44,914 --> 00:14:45,865
What are you doing?

247
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:19,236
No touching the merchandise.

248
00:15:20,997 --> 00:15:22,582
Are you here to make another payment?

249
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:23,491
Yeah.

250
00:15:30,872 --> 00:15:35,100
$9,57?

251
00:15:35,747 --> 00:15:38,826
At this rate, your mom's piano will be yours..

252
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,914
In 2021..

253
00:17:17,127 --> 00:17:19,025
Bye , Bern!
-See you later, Charlie!

254
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,470
So many thank yous..

255
00:17:57,497 --> 00:17:59,815
My agents,
my managers..

256
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:04,244
And of course none of this would be possible
without my trusty rag..

257
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,265
Dad, you..

258
00:18:18,308 --> 00:18:19,376
Hey!

259
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,758
What are you doing here?

260
00:18:20,803 --> 00:18:22,579
I didn't mean to startle you,
i work here.

261
00:18:22,614 --> 00:18:24,258
That could be fake.

262
00:18:24,284 --> 00:18:26,174
People get fake IDs.

263
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:31,040
If i were gonna get a fake ID,
would i use this picture?

264
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:37,084
Yeah, he's checked out.

265
00:18:38,081 --> 00:18:40,821
What do you have behind your back, Charlie?

266
00:18:40,941 --> 00:18:42,387
Nothing.

267
00:18:42,964 --> 00:18:44,705
You're not a good liar.

268
00:18:44,783 --> 00:18:46,500
I am too a good liar.

269
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:50,156
I am a very good liar, i've lied successfuly
on many occasions.

270
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:51,866
In fact just yesterday.

271
00:18:55,618 --> 00:18:57,273
I'm not a very good liar.

272
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,262
I lied.

273
00:18:58,288 --> 00:19:00,457
See? You are a liar.

274
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,118
Kadee, my darling, my love.
It's me your prince, you're late for the..

275
00:19:10,161 --> 00:19:11,465
Who's this guy?

276
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,812
Charlie.

277
00:19:12,908 --> 00:19:14,080
Okay.

278
00:19:14,141 --> 00:19:16,915
Are you signed to the Majesty Records as well?

279
00:19:17,213 --> 00:19:18,848
I'm the janitor.

280
00:19:18,968 --> 00:19:21,481
That's a bit of a lame stage name, mate.

281
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:25,411
I'll go with something else.
I don't know, the Janitor?

282
00:19:25,525 --> 00:19:27,240
It might work.

283
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,935
What, are you like a rapper or something?

284
00:19:29,979 --> 00:19:33,565
No, i'm just the actual janitor.

285
00:19:34,378 --> 00:19:36,750
Oh, well..

286
00:19:37,048 --> 00:19:38,753
That's great.

287
00:19:39,672 --> 00:19:43,036
Okay.. Bye.

288
00:19:44,663 --> 00:19:49,266
It's time for Kadee Worth's fragrance
launch party.

289
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,978
I told them to wait,
let's go.

290
00:20:02,848 --> 00:20:04,510
Kadee..

291
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,347
Great..

292
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:08,965
A wonderful evening with my boyfriend.

293
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,382
He's Finn.

294
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:12,560
Most girls would kill
to be set up with him.

295
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:14,856
I know, i know.
-You should be "happy".

296
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:16,124
"And i am".

297
00:20:16,177 --> 00:20:18,600
Why are you guys keep doing
that thing with your fingers?

298
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,653
I've told you, it confuses me.

299
00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:24,933
And it frightens me.
It makes me want to punch you both.

300
00:20:24,977 --> 00:20:27,113
How's this for my "i'm so happy..

301
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,408
"I'm in a relationship that my dad thinks would sell records" face.

302
00:20:31,895 --> 00:20:33,609
It's good.
-Great.

303
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:35,341
Come on, trumpet.

304
00:20:36,426 --> 00:20:39,425
If you're gonna be late, call.
You know how it works.

305
00:20:39,452 --> 00:20:43,292
He's probably the youngest janitor ever,
am i right?

306
00:20:55,274 --> 00:20:58,301
Uh.. Would you..

307
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,626
That's funny.

308
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:06,022
I could do that too.
We're playing..

309
00:21:10,313 --> 00:21:12,561
Inappropriate.

310
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:16,981
How adorable are we, right?

311
00:21:17,751 --> 00:21:20,034
Just adorable.

312
00:21:52,274 --> 00:21:54,688
Scrub that, uh..

313
00:22:06,261 --> 00:22:08,798
I hope you have a good night, sir.

314
00:22:11,885 --> 00:22:15,725
How about that weather we're having?
Very nice..

315
00:22:51,202 --> 00:22:52,995
What do you think, Trumpet?

316
00:22:57,398 --> 00:22:58,955
Someday.

317
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:09,407
Hey Kadee.
-Hey!

318
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:11,482
How's your dog?
-He's good, he misses you.

319
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:14,736
I miss him too.
I think i'm falling for you dog.

320
00:23:17,389 --> 00:23:18,666
Somebody will..

321
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:21,386
Somebody will clean that up.
-Somebody like the janitor?

322
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:23,724
That's me.

323
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,996
I should probably get started on that.

324
00:23:47,065 --> 00:23:49,296
Sweet.

325
00:24:09,377 --> 00:24:11,354
Testing, 1..2..3.

326
00:24:11,389 --> 00:24:13,324
Ready to record his new single..

327
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:16,858
Grammy winner Charlie Prince,
5 gold albums, 8 top ten hits.

328
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:19,717
With his new hit
"Hands up".

329
00:24:19,837 --> 00:24:21,099
What..

330
00:24:41,745 --> 00:24:43,074
Thank you.

331
00:24:43,144 --> 00:24:44,736
Thank you..

332
00:24:46,725 --> 00:24:49,953
Shawn, i'm so sorry.
I was just messing around.

333
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,848
Messing around?

334
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:55,015
How'd you like to try that for real?
-For real?

335
00:24:55,478 --> 00:24:58,842
You gotta be kidding,
i'm just the kid with rags and mops.

336
00:24:58,921 --> 00:25:01,947
Dude, you are way more than just a kid with rags.

337
00:25:01,991 --> 00:25:04,781
What i heard in there was a bonafide
recording artist.

338
00:25:04,834 --> 00:25:08,162
And a real recording artist needs a demo,
i can help you make that happen.

339
00:25:08,197 --> 00:25:10,576
You mean here, at the studio?

340
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:13,416
Don't say anything, just sing.

341
00:25:18,944 --> 00:25:20,999
Alright, you're ready to go?

342
00:25:21,524 --> 00:25:22,976
Here it comes.

343
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:56,581
Hey, can we do another?
I got tons of more songs.

344
00:28:08,847 --> 00:28:11,882
Boys, this is your ticket..

345
00:28:11,943 --> 00:28:13,841
To the big time.

346
00:28:14,499 --> 00:28:16,484
What does it say?

347
00:28:17,508 --> 00:28:20,694
Thank you for sending your demo material
to Majesty Records..

348
00:28:20,712 --> 00:28:27,610
For consideration, presently your demo package is one of a quantity of exemplary material that was submitted to our office.

349
00:28:27,638 --> 00:28:32,103
We regret to inform you,
you did not qualify..

350
00:28:32,223 --> 00:28:36,285
At the Majesty Records talent contest..

351
00:28:45,996 --> 00:28:47,829
This is your fault.

352
00:28:50,256 --> 00:28:53,057
You're my brother.

353
00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:55,964
I love you.
-I love you too.

354
00:29:23,191 --> 00:29:25,675
And why are we following this kid?

355
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,794
I don't know.

356
00:29:28,088 --> 00:29:29,487
There's just something about him.

357
00:29:29,522 --> 00:29:30,586
OMG..

358
00:29:30,628 --> 00:29:33,161
He's so dreamy..

359
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:35,591
Just keep the engine running.

360
00:29:36,347 --> 00:29:37,795
Charlie..

361
00:29:40,318 --> 00:29:42,075
What did you do, kid?

362
00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:43,495
Sell a body part?

363
00:29:43,544 --> 00:29:45,070
I got a job.

364
00:29:47,716 --> 00:29:51,965
If you keep doing payments like this,
and that piano's yours 5 years top.

365
00:29:53,647 --> 00:29:57,082
So, what can i play for you today, my man?

366
00:29:57,292 --> 00:29:59,328
Play "Perfect Harmony" again.

367
00:29:59,356 --> 00:30:01,197
For $100..

368
00:30:02,142 --> 00:30:05,463
It's Perfect Harmony,
going out to my man Bernie.

369
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,848
Not bad for a janitor.

370
00:30:16,674 --> 00:30:19,914
Thanks, i.. i was just messing around.

371
00:30:19,941 --> 00:30:22,551
Why are you here anyway?
Did you follow me here?

372
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:25,364
I didn't follow, i was just..

373
00:30:26,095 --> 00:30:28,635
Looking for some creepy stuff
for my room.

374
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:30,731
Uh uh..

375
00:30:30,801 --> 00:30:31,969
What are you doing here?

376
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,720
You come to some pawn shop to play
a ratty old piano, what's that about?

377
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,032
It's my mom's.

378
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,537
And more gorgeous, it cannot be.

379
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:41,630
Thanks.

380
00:30:45,493 --> 00:30:47,724
I should say it was my mom's.

381
00:30:47,962 --> 00:30:49,488
Once upon a time.

382
00:30:49,788 --> 00:30:52,562
So, your mom's gone?

383
00:30:53,829 --> 00:30:58,463
My stepdad used the piano money
to buy karaoke machine.

384
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,961
Sorry, Charlie.

385
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:08,050
Why don't you let a professional handle this?

386
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:17,264
My mom died too.

387
00:31:17,484 --> 00:31:19,401
I'm sorry, i didn't know.

388
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,320
How could you? I don't wear the
"My mom died" T-Shirt much these days.

389
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:24,922
You have one too?

390
00:31:26,098 --> 00:31:29,211
It's good to talk to somebody who understand.

391
00:32:22,262 --> 00:32:23,766
That was fun.

392
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:26,803
What were you playing before?

393
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:29,398
That was just a little bit of a song i wrote.

394
00:32:29,518 --> 00:32:32,169
So those were your songs i got wet
the other day?

395
00:32:32,232 --> 00:32:35,870
Don't worry, they stayed all in one piece.

396
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:40,507
Can I?

397
00:32:46,219 --> 00:32:48,178
These lyrics are great.

398
00:32:48,619 --> 00:32:50,700
Why haven't i heard you sing
songs like thesE?

399
00:32:50,714 --> 00:32:53,093
Right, my dad would go nuts.

400
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,937
They don't exactly fit the
Kadee Worth Brand.

401
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:58,568
But maybe someday i will.

402
00:32:58,827 --> 00:33:01,045
No, you need to do it today.

403
00:33:01,955 --> 00:33:04,242
I want to take you some place.
Do you trust me?

404
00:33:04,277 --> 00:33:06,047
Ever since i was a little girl..

405
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:08,069
My dad always told me..

406
00:33:08,244 --> 00:33:11,394
Kadee, trust the janitor.

407
00:33:14,466 --> 00:33:15,802
I trust you.

408
00:33:19,441 --> 00:33:20,942
Miss Worth..

409
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:23,203
For my kid.

410
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,425
Make it out to Bernie.

411
00:33:27,013 --> 00:33:28,518
For my kid.

412
00:33:29,197 --> 00:33:30,729
Named Bernie.

413
00:33:37,187 --> 00:33:40,259
Princess, subway is one block away.

414
00:33:40,379 --> 00:33:43,089
Kadee, your dad's not gonna like it.

415
00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:46,700
He's also not gonna like you're using his Yankee tickets without him knowing.

416
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,645
You two enjoy yourselves.

417
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:52,976
You're gonna need this.

418
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,730
So..
-This is the spot.

419
00:34:03,772 --> 00:34:04,815
Here?

420
00:34:04,829 --> 00:34:06,068
It's perfect.

421
00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:09,379
And no one will know it's you.

422
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:13,374
That makes me feel a lot better.

423
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,305
Ladies and gentlemen, i would like to..

424
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:26,173
Charlie, no.
-What?

425
00:34:27,361 --> 00:34:28,824
I can't do it.

426
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:32,754
70,000 screaming fans,
you're good to go.

427
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:35,197
8 tourists, and you have a problem?

428
00:34:47,577 --> 00:34:48,846
Okay.

429
00:37:06,645 --> 00:37:08,738
Break it up.

430
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:15,058
Move on, or i'll give you a ticket.

431
00:37:15,261 --> 00:37:17,047
Ow..

432
00:37:24,155 --> 00:37:25,626
Here you go.

433
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:28,838
You gotta keep this.

434
00:37:29,195 --> 00:37:31,787
First dollar you make from your own music.

435
00:37:31,815 --> 00:37:34,768
No no, you put that back in there.

436
00:37:35,756 --> 00:37:37,373
Thanks, Charlie.

437
00:37:39,052 --> 00:37:40,292
You're good.

438
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,203
You should do this for a living..

439
00:37:44,373 --> 00:37:45,737
Thanks.

440
00:37:45,857 --> 00:37:47,312
Good.

441
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:51,559
No no.. Wait wait!
Come back, hold the bus!

442
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,253
Come on, i got it!
-Wait!

443
00:37:54,598 --> 00:37:56,123
Come on!

444
00:37:56,573 --> 00:37:58,441
Hey, one second.

445
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,004
Thank you.

446
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:11,866
I can't believe i just did that.
-You were awesome.

447
00:38:11,986 --> 00:38:14,555
I haven't felt like that performing
in so long.

448
00:38:14,604 --> 00:38:16,738
Thank you, Charlie.
-My pleasure.

449
00:38:16,787 --> 00:38:18,033
Let me pay you back somehow.

450
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:19,579
No no..
-Here.

451
00:38:19,621 --> 00:38:22,014
I want you to come to this party
my dad's throwing.

452
00:38:23,043 --> 00:38:24,356
Really?
-It's gonna be amazing.

453
00:38:24,377 --> 00:38:27,331
Except i'll be working and have to miss out
on all the fun.

454
00:38:33,282 --> 00:38:34,655
Wait!

455
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:36,909
Are you Kadee Worth?

456
00:38:37,112 --> 00:38:39,122
Can i have your autograph?
-Sure.

457
00:38:39,164 --> 00:38:41,081
It's Kadee Worth.

458
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:48,558
This is Kadee Worth!

459
00:39:03,978 --> 00:39:05,525
You're late.

460
00:39:07,868 --> 00:39:11,431
Nope, 58 seconds to spare, so..

461
00:39:11,487 --> 00:39:13,306
If you'll excuse me.

462
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,032
What's this?

463
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,346
Invitation to..

464
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:27,028
Majesty Records' masquarade ball?

465
00:39:27,056 --> 00:39:29,673
That's when they announce the winner
to the talent search.

466
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,969
Charlie, did you steal this?

467
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,215
No, i didn't steal it.

468
00:39:33,236 --> 00:39:34,656
Kadee Worth gave them to me.

469
00:39:35,233 --> 00:39:37,136
Right.. Kadee Worth gave it to you.

470
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:40,446
Kadee Worth, that's so cool.

471
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:42,632
It is.

472
00:39:42,863 --> 00:39:44,661
Just give it back.

473
00:39:44,948 --> 00:39:47,630
Charlie, i'm sorry..

474
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:49,876
I can't let this go to waste.

475
00:39:49,918 --> 00:39:51,406
Excuse me?

476
00:39:51,526 --> 00:39:56,447
Boys, your stepbrother has given you
the opportunity of a life time.

477
00:39:56,489 --> 00:39:59,416
You're gonna go to that party and
you're gonna show Reginald Worth..

478
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:02,314
That he made a big mistake
rejecting your CD.

479
00:40:02,356 --> 00:40:04,511
That is my invitation!

480
00:40:05,582 --> 00:40:06,876
Charlie..

481
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:10,276
This is your opportunity too,
you..

482
00:40:10,507 --> 00:40:12,874
You can stay behind and you can..

483
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:16,668
You can run the karaoke machine.
Consider it a promotion.

484
00:40:17,557 --> 00:40:19,278
Boys, get to bed.

485
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:23,128
We gotta get up early and rent ourselves
some costumes.

486
00:40:27,086 --> 00:40:29,446
Masquerade.. We're going..

487
00:40:29,509 --> 00:40:32,021
Popularity is growing.

488
00:40:32,049 --> 00:40:36,478
Our lyrics are flowing..
-the ladies..
-There's gonna be ladies?

489
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,679
There's gonna be ladies..

490
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,171
I can't do this anymore.

491
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:43,496
Are there gonna be ladies?

492
00:40:44,462 --> 00:40:46,477
Diego, get my sewing machine.

493
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:49,049
You mean that sewing machine i found on the street
that you didn't want?

494
00:40:49,105 --> 00:40:53,127
Yes, finally one of your pieces of junk
is gonna be of some use.

495
00:40:53,295 --> 00:40:58,295
I'll get it in a second, can you believe someone
threw away this perfectly good bike?

496
00:40:58,345 --> 00:41:01,879
Stop messing with the garbage, we gotta get
Charlie into that party.

497
00:41:01,999 --> 00:41:03,566
What party?

498
00:41:32,555 --> 00:41:34,675
Hey, done with your chores?

499
00:41:34,724 --> 00:41:37,544
You're smiling.
Nobody smile about chores.

500
00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:39,876
Ta da!
For you.

501
00:41:39,918 --> 00:41:41,262
To work the karaoke machine?

502
00:41:41,269 --> 00:41:43,081
For the Majesty Records' party.

503
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:45,102
Arthur gave my invitation to Androyd.

504
00:41:45,137 --> 00:41:47,313
Come on, you're gonna let a detail
like an invitation to stop you?

505
00:41:47,355 --> 00:41:49,911
No, i'm gonna let about a billion other things stop me.

506
00:41:49,932 --> 00:41:53,349
Arthur will destroy me if he found out i went,
i have school tomorrow, there's tons of security..

507
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:56,023
Maybe even an X-Ray.

508
00:41:56,499 --> 00:41:57,688
For you.

509
00:41:57,925 --> 00:42:00,566
Your welcome.
-Thank you.

510
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:02,692
It's awesome, but..

511
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:05,378
Who's gonna MC karaoke
if i'm not here?

512
00:42:05,921 --> 00:42:06,699
I'm your man.

513
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:08,326
Seriously?
-Yeah.

514
00:42:08,396 --> 00:42:11,764
I've always wanted to do this job
and i know i can do a great job too.

515
00:42:11,825 --> 00:42:13,207
What if i see Arthur at the party?

516
00:42:13,242 --> 00:42:14,773
We thought of that.

517
00:42:15,219 --> 00:42:16,857
You may see Arthur..

518
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:20,111
But Arthur will never see you.

519
00:42:23,477 --> 00:42:25,094
Game changer.

520
00:42:27,603 --> 00:42:29,016
Hey!

521
00:42:39,075 --> 00:42:41,525
Boys! let's go!

522
00:42:42,777 --> 00:42:44,546
Have a nice pity party.

523
00:42:44,588 --> 00:42:47,023
You're having a party?

524
00:42:47,058 --> 00:42:49,206
I was making fun of him, you idiot.

525
00:42:50,724 --> 00:42:53,376
I gotta..
I'll bring you some cake.

526
00:43:01,197 --> 00:43:03,080
I still don't know how i'm
gonna make it home before Arthur.

527
00:43:03,108 --> 00:43:04,439
That'll be easy.

528
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,448
You're gonna take the fastest transportation
there is in this city.

529
00:43:07,483 --> 00:43:09,386
Tada!

530
00:43:10,682 --> 00:43:13,236
My trusted steed, is now yours.

531
00:43:13,264 --> 00:43:14,600
Perfect!

532
00:43:15,663 --> 00:43:17,629
Do you have the mask?
-Yeah.

533
00:43:23,578 --> 00:43:25,656
Do you think he'll get in?

534
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:27,223
Not a chance.

535
00:43:31,088 --> 00:43:35,231
Kadee, you're performing your number 1 single tonight
"Love you, Hate you". Looking forward to it?

536
00:43:35,259 --> 00:43:38,650
Yes, i'm very excited, it's always great to perform
in front of a crowd.

537
00:43:38,671 --> 00:43:41,820
Whether it's Madison Square Garden
or here.

538
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,672
Would you say, this is your most personal album to date?

539
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:47,219
When you say personal..
-Of course it is.

540
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:49,323
Of course it is, right?

541
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:52,318
Except for the part in the song
when she said she hates me.

542
00:43:52,367 --> 00:43:55,714
Cause she doesn't, right?
Do you?

543
00:43:55,777 --> 00:43:58,497
It's like when i was recording my album..

544
00:43:58,518 --> 00:44:00,078
You never want to speak the truth..

545
00:44:18,704 --> 00:44:23,294
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Nick Cannon.

546
00:44:26,524 --> 00:44:28,567
Thank you.

547
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:33,582
Welcome Majesty Records' guests.
Are you all ready to get down?

548
00:44:35,804 --> 00:44:37,638
Let's do this.

549
00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:48,238
Lloyd, shape up!

550
00:44:48,588 --> 00:44:51,424
You'll never get discovered
makin a mess of yourself.

551
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,682
I'm more likely to get discovered..

552
00:44:53,717 --> 00:44:55,011
What?

553
00:44:55,424 --> 00:44:59,114
Think about it, you're walking to a party,
there's 2 guys standing.

554
00:44:59,156 --> 00:45:02,570
One of them has barbeque sauce,
covering his face.

555
00:45:02,605 --> 00:45:05,174
Me, i look at the sauce guy.

556
00:45:05,217 --> 00:45:09,557
Andrew, would you like to go mingle
while your brother cleans himself up?

557
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:11,111
Absolutely.

558
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,396
Hey.

559
00:45:16,648 --> 00:45:19,456
Hi, i'm Llyod.
-I'm tammy.

560
00:45:19,988 --> 00:45:22,285
No.. No..

561
00:45:22,334 --> 00:45:24,916
No!

562
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,568
Invitation?

563
00:45:34,995 --> 00:45:36,458
That guy stole my ticket.

564
00:45:36,514 --> 00:45:39,908
And i was like 'Use it, no way that doorman's gonna believe that's your ticket'.

565
00:45:39,922 --> 00:45:42,926
And then he was like
"doormen are stupid."

566
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:44,382
What?

567
00:45:44,417 --> 00:45:48,533
And i was like "doormen is a respectable profession
with a very rich history".

568
00:45:48,547 --> 00:45:50,032
Wait here.

569
00:45:51,026 --> 00:45:52,411
That worked.

570
00:46:00,816 --> 00:46:02,174
Sorry.

571
00:46:03,195 --> 00:46:05,476
Excuse me, i didn't see you.

572
00:46:06,098 --> 00:46:07,974
No, it's my bad.

573
00:46:08,527 --> 00:46:11,006
I didn't see you there, big guy.

574
00:46:11,321 --> 00:46:14,260
Keep up the good work.
Bye.

575
00:46:14,561 --> 00:46:17,411
Do i know you?
-No.

576
00:46:33,044 --> 00:46:35,780
ALright, make some noise!

577
00:46:38,821 --> 00:46:42,322
Come on, come on.
I got babies at home that make more noise than that.

578
00:46:42,357 --> 00:46:44,078
Make some noise!

579
00:46:46,346 --> 00:46:48,942
Yeah, that's what i'm talking about.

580
00:46:48,998 --> 00:46:54,265
We got Kadee Worth in the building,
Ya'll make some noise!

581
00:46:55,074 --> 00:46:58,468
What up, Nick!
-What's up, girl!

582
00:46:59,195 --> 00:47:04,529
You all are looking beautiful,
let's go ahead and show in the Majesty Records, we know how to have a good time.

583
00:47:07,581 --> 00:47:10,249
Are you ready to dance with your king?

584
00:47:10,634 --> 00:47:13,321
No, i'm ready to dance with you.

585
00:47:15,322 --> 00:47:16,588
Hey! Looking good.

586
00:47:16,609 --> 00:47:18,233
Thanks, you too.

587
00:47:18,247 --> 00:47:20,647
Thank you for doing this for me.
-Anytime.

588
00:47:21,103 --> 00:47:22,488
Impressed.

589
00:47:22,516 --> 00:47:24,042
Yeah.

590
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:14,512
Let's mix it up, party people!

591
00:48:14,547 --> 00:48:16,450
Ya'll looking a little too comfortable.

592
00:48:16,457 --> 00:48:20,993
I want everybody on the dance floor,
turn to your left and meet your new partner.

593
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,278
I guess you're my partner.
-I guess i am.

594
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:41,758
So, having fun tonight?

595
00:48:41,807 --> 00:48:43,479
If i'm being honest..

596
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,222
Not really.

597
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,613
I guess now i am.

598
00:48:56,119 --> 00:48:58,976
I don't know, i just have a hard time..

599
00:48:59,697 --> 00:49:02,328
Relaxing and being yourself?

600
00:49:02,797 --> 00:49:04,380
How do you know that?

601
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:06,361
I see.

602
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:14,666
Thanks for the dance,
you're pretty amazing.

603
00:49:16,485 --> 00:49:20,330
No, it's true. You're too amazing
to be anything less than yourself.

604
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,046
Just be you.

605
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,692
Nice to meet you.

606
00:49:34,077 --> 00:49:41,476
Alright, alright, it is time to announce the finalist
for the Majesty Records' talent search.

607
00:49:44,336 --> 00:49:45,819
It should be Androyd.

608
00:49:45,845 --> 00:49:48,190
And the winner is..

609
00:49:48,828 --> 00:49:51,426
Fay Train!

610
00:49:52,262 --> 00:49:54,344
Fay Train..

611
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:59,524
Ladies and gentlemen, i've just been informed
that the plane has been delayed.

612
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:03,325
And Fay Train will not be with us tonight.

613
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,690
What?

614
00:50:04,716 --> 00:50:06,527
Why am i just hear, Irma!

615
00:50:06,562 --> 00:50:08,725
I did not,
i was not aware.

616
00:50:08,769 --> 00:50:12,110
I.. We could..

617
00:50:12,302 --> 00:50:16,256
They're upset, somebody better give them
a runner up.

618
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,193
Sometimes opportunity knocks.

619
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:21,542
Sorry, off limits.

620
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:23,702
It's me, Charlie!

621
00:50:24,446 --> 00:50:26,274
Hey man.
-Hey.

622
00:50:26,484 --> 00:50:27,928
Check it out.

623
00:50:28,048 --> 00:50:29,353
All done.

624
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,464
Rags?

625
00:50:30,499 --> 00:50:32,319
Everyone needs a stage name.

626
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:35,229
I figured when you're huge, you need to remember
where you came from.

627
00:50:35,264 --> 00:50:39,051
So all those millions of fans
don't go to your head.

628
00:50:40,832 --> 00:50:43,272
This is the nicest thing
anyone ever done for me.

629
00:50:43,299 --> 00:50:45,914
Don't get all emotional on me, now.

630
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:48,023
It's good by the way,
really good.

631
00:50:48,084 --> 00:50:52,836
Hello, Majesty Records. I'm Andrew.
-I'm Lloyd, and we're Androyd.

632
00:50:53,605 --> 00:50:55,381
No..

633
00:51:03,028 --> 00:51:04,900
No..

634
00:51:05,576 --> 00:51:07,080
Who are they?

635
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:09,330
Oh man, what are they doing?

636
00:51:09,374 --> 00:51:11,333
You know these guys?

637
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:15,977
Unfortunately yes, those clows are sort of my stepbrothers.

638
00:51:25,421 --> 00:51:28,147
I can't take this anymore.

639
00:51:28,267 --> 00:51:30,308
This is your chance,
get up there.

640
00:51:30,544 --> 00:51:32,775
What? On stage?
I can't do that.

641
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:34,495
If you're terrible,
nobody will know it's you.

642
00:51:34,522 --> 00:51:37,067
Come on, you're gonna kill it.
-Okay.

643
00:51:50,231 --> 00:51:51,455
What happened?

644
00:51:51,481 --> 00:51:54,215
What did you do?
-Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for..

645
00:51:54,285 --> 00:51:55,885
Rags!

646
00:52:49,673 --> 00:52:52,358
Hey!
Stop it!

647
00:53:12,803 --> 00:53:15,401
Charlie?

648
00:53:54,875 --> 00:53:56,449
Let's get out of here.

649
00:53:56,493 --> 00:53:58,837
No, i want to stay for the party.

650
00:53:58,855 --> 00:54:01,149
These girls are totally checking me out.

651
00:54:01,175 --> 00:54:03,607
They just want to interview you
for the Idiot Magazine.

652
00:54:03,651 --> 00:54:04,493
really?

653
00:54:04,537 --> 00:54:08,447
Plenty of people here she could talk,
if these people are audience!

654
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:10,849
Come on, we gotta go strategize.

655
00:54:10,884 --> 00:54:13,315
Never give up!
-never surrender.

656
00:54:19,563 --> 00:54:21,863
Losers!

657
00:54:26,928 --> 00:54:29,115
Wait!

658
00:54:29,456 --> 00:54:31,144
Who are you?

659
00:54:39,592 --> 00:54:41,840
Be you..

660
00:54:53,717 --> 00:54:56,586
Did i miss something?

661
00:55:10,303 --> 00:55:13,225
You're gonna pay me or what?

662
00:55:20,295 --> 00:55:22,350
Oh no!

663
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:26,604
I told you i'm married!

664
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,878
Martha, it's me.
-Charlie!

665
00:55:28,998 --> 00:55:30,426
You scared me!

666
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:34,150
I'm locked out.
-After the other night, Arthur nailed the mensroom's window shut.

667
00:55:34,185 --> 00:55:36,048
So, how was the party?
-Later..

668
00:55:36,135 --> 00:55:38,516
Arthur, keep him distracted.

669
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,222
Diego!

670
00:55:44,055 --> 00:55:46,268
Hurry, hurry!
-What about my tip?

671
00:55:46,303 --> 00:55:48,035
No!

672
00:55:52,208 --> 00:55:54,325
Hey Arthur, check it out.

673
00:55:54,445 --> 00:55:58,264
Idiot! Straight to bed, you two!
I'm checking on Charlie.

674
00:55:58,299 --> 00:56:01,763
What is this?
This place is a mess.

675
00:56:06,411 --> 00:56:09,317
Arthur, hungry? Thristy?
I made you your favorite.

676
00:56:09,352 --> 00:56:11,347
I'm sure the food at the party
was awful.

677
00:56:11,364 --> 00:56:13,999
No! Thank you!
-I'm thirsty.

678
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,213
Diego! Hurry up!

679
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:23,243
Come on!

680
00:56:23,286 --> 00:56:25,125
Go!

681
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,950
Arthur, wait wait..

682
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:29,905
I must ask you something.
-Now?

683
00:56:29,923 --> 00:56:31,462
Yeah.

684
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:34,305
I need to know something.

685
00:56:36,378 --> 00:56:38,294
Out with it, Diego!

686
00:56:38,329 --> 00:56:40,498
What do you want for breakfast?

687
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:45,206
The ommelete you had the other day
was very tasty, right?

688
00:56:45,232 --> 00:56:47,857
Yeah sure, it's fine.
Whatever!

689
00:56:59,589 --> 00:57:02,475
Move!
-Move?

690
00:57:03,104 --> 00:57:04,976
This way?

691
00:57:05,011 --> 00:57:06,892
Move!

692
00:57:12,606 --> 00:57:13,988
I didn't hear you knock.

693
00:57:14,032 --> 00:57:16,122
That's because i didn't.

694
00:57:37,192 --> 00:57:38,985
My CD.

695
00:57:39,562 --> 00:57:41,784
No no no..

696
00:57:48,057 --> 00:57:49,054
That's not good.

697
00:57:49,081 --> 00:57:51,612
Dad, if you could just please..
-I don't have time.

698
00:57:51,647 --> 00:57:54,411
Fay Train is thinking about signing with another label.
I have to meet with him.

699
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,239
But this is the Rags guy from the party last night.

700
00:57:56,257 --> 00:57:59,286
Kadee, i am the guy that's always looking
for the next best thing.

701
00:57:59,312 --> 00:58:03,088
But clearly Rags isn't ready for the big time,
or else he wouldn't ran out like he did.

702
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:05,930
Besides, i'm more concern about you.

703
00:58:06,062 --> 00:58:07,400
Irma tells me you've been missing meetings.

704
00:58:07,435 --> 00:58:09,668
Irma needs to mind her own business.

705
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:12,301
You're changing the subject.

706
00:58:12,329 --> 00:58:15,645
Rags is amazing, and if you give him a chance
you can see he has a lot to offer..

707
00:58:15,688 --> 00:58:17,630
Kadee, i don't want to talk about Rags anymore.

708
00:58:17,665 --> 00:58:20,421
We're about to launch the biggest record of your carrer,
and you're getting distracted.

709
00:58:20,465 --> 00:58:21,751
And you're not listening.

710
00:58:21,777 --> 00:58:24,821
It's my job to make sure my daughter's head
is on straight.

711
00:58:25,092 --> 00:58:28,982
Your job as my dad or
chairman of Majesty Records?

712
00:58:29,909 --> 00:58:32,183
We'll talk about this when i get back.

713
00:58:45,501 --> 00:58:47,452
No problem.

714
00:58:51,013 --> 00:58:52,806
Hey you!

715
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:55,247
Hey, kadee.
What are you doing here?

716
00:58:55,273 --> 00:58:57,096
Where were you last night?

717
00:58:58,443 --> 00:59:01,032
Caught a cold, stayed home,
watched a movie.

718
00:59:01,093 --> 00:59:03,098
Really?
What did you watch?

719
00:59:04,673 --> 00:59:08,236
Can't remember the name.
Reese Whiterspoon was in it though..

720
00:59:08,356 --> 00:59:10,947
Cried my eyes out.
-Right.

721
00:59:11,341 --> 00:59:13,387
You're right when you said
you weren't a good liar.

722
00:59:13,457 --> 00:59:14,874
Helps to practice, though.

723
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:16,790
Anyway, you totally missed out.

724
00:59:16,807 --> 00:59:19,178
I know, i wanted to hear you sing.
-No, not me!

725
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,482
This Rags guy perform,
he killed it!

726
00:59:21,534 --> 00:59:22,873
Really?
-Really!

727
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:24,701
This guy Rags killed it?

728
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,898
The dude can sing.

729
00:59:26,986 --> 00:59:29,295
And he's not too bad at the kissing stuff either.

730
00:59:29,321 --> 00:59:30,695
He kissed you?

731
00:59:30,712 --> 00:59:33,808
Just laid one on me,
no time to react. Really..

732
00:59:33,826 --> 00:59:36,607
There was nothing i could do.
-Right.

733
00:59:37,596 --> 00:59:39,502
So why did you come here today?

734
00:59:39,528 --> 00:59:41,583
I was hoping you'd be able to help me.

735
00:59:42,082 --> 00:59:43,481
Rags left a CD.

736
00:59:43,525 --> 00:59:45,265
No contact info,
no nothing.

737
00:59:45,283 --> 00:59:48,720
But what he did have was a track of the song
he performed last night..

738
00:59:48,746 --> 00:59:50,513
And this.

739
00:59:59,781 --> 01:00:01,792
The song is great.

740
01:00:01,819 --> 01:00:04,959
That song someday is gonna lead me
straight to Rags.

741
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:07,568
Wait, you want to find Rags? Why?

742
01:00:07,603 --> 01:00:12,327
Charlie, you should have seen him,
he sang about something that was more than I love you, I hate you..

743
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:14,523
It was really inspiring.

744
01:00:19,847 --> 01:00:22,366
Kadee, i should tell you..

745
01:00:23,118 --> 01:00:25,007
I'm Rags.

746
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:30,956
He's amazing, Charlie seriously,
you gotta help me find this guy.

747
01:00:31,076 --> 01:00:35,060
Sometimes it feels like the whole world
wants a piece of Kadee Worth..

748
01:00:35,987 --> 01:00:37,789
But not you, Charlie.

749
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:41,515
Please help me find Rags.

750
01:00:41,952 --> 01:00:43,693
And how do you plan on finding him?

751
01:00:43,719 --> 01:00:46,806
That song, you and i are the only two
that have heard it.

752
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:49,477
We'll hold an audition.
Whoever sings Someday..

753
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:51,515
Is the real Rags..

754
01:00:52,145 --> 01:00:54,061
So are you in, or out?

755
01:00:55,775 --> 01:00:56,965
In.

756
01:01:02,373 --> 01:01:03,790
Good job.

757
01:01:03,825 --> 01:01:06,125
Can i recommend in D minor?

758
01:01:06,711 --> 01:01:09,014
Oh..

759
01:01:09,364 --> 01:01:11,218
My God!

760
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:14,732
You're her!

761
01:01:15,449 --> 01:01:16,814
Would you..

762
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:21,014
Would you sign this for me?
Please?

763
01:01:29,468 --> 01:01:31,148
We're up on Perez..

764
01:01:31,183 --> 01:01:32,547
That's great.

765
01:01:32,591 --> 01:01:35,292
Guess what? We're on MTV homepage too.

766
01:01:35,327 --> 01:01:37,225
Nice!

767
01:01:38,257 --> 01:01:40,417
Guilty Group is having a sample sale.

768
01:01:40,537 --> 01:01:43,247
Majesty Records will sign the first person
who proved they're Rags.

769
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:45,462
We're scouring the internet,
we're holding auditions..

770
01:01:45,505 --> 01:01:50,124
I know he's out there somewhere, and i won't stop until i find him.
Are you Rags?

771
01:01:50,466 --> 01:01:51,664
Yes!

772
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:55,443
Hello?

773
01:01:56,538 --> 01:01:59,818
Great, she's on her way.
Thank you.

774
01:01:59,871 --> 01:02:02,757
The venue is available.
-Yes!

775
01:02:02,801 --> 01:02:04,908
Let's go check it.
Let's go.

776
01:02:11,451 --> 01:02:13,157
Thanks.

777
01:02:14,145 --> 01:02:15,869
Who are you texting now?
-I'm not texting.

778
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:17,223
I'm tweeting about the Rags audition.

779
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,101
I just hit 7 million followers.

780
01:02:20,118 --> 01:02:22,375
Seriously? 7 million followers?

781
01:02:22,392 --> 01:02:24,022
Yeah, how many do you have?

782
01:02:25,501 --> 01:02:27,600
My gosh, tons.

783
01:02:27,836 --> 01:02:30,262
So many tweeters..

784
01:02:30,382 --> 01:02:32,222
Also follow my..

785
01:02:32,327 --> 01:02:34,400
My tweeting..
-Tweeting?

786
01:02:34,452 --> 01:02:36,554
You're hilarious.
-You're hilarious.

787
01:02:36,606 --> 01:02:39,580
You're hilarious.
-No, you're hilarious..

788
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:44,673
My bad, i thought that bench was longer.

789
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,991
You're lucky i like you.

790
01:02:49,691 --> 01:02:51,913
No, i'm Rags!

791
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,511
This is what is happening.

792
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:07,717
There is a mob scene in the lobby.

793
01:03:07,743 --> 01:03:11,137
Since you were too busy to listen to the CD,
i'm holding auditions to find Rags.

794
01:03:11,172 --> 01:03:12,834
Yes, Irma has made me aware.

795
01:03:12,869 --> 01:03:15,236
Kadee, this is a complete fiasco..

796
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:19,295
You are putting your music in jeopardy,
and your relationship with Finn.. He's a mess!

797
01:03:19,339 --> 01:03:21,097
Look at him!

798
01:03:21,141 --> 01:03:22,473
Relationship?

799
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:26,426
This guy Rags is kicking me off all
the magazine covers.

800
01:03:26,546 --> 01:03:30,001
But more importantly, i miss you.
I miss us.

801
01:03:30,036 --> 01:03:31,270
We don't talk anymore.

802
01:03:31,313 --> 01:03:35,075
Because we never talked.
This is a business arrangement.

803
01:03:35,116 --> 01:03:36,533
And none of you ever listened.

804
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,525
Because you're too busy running around
with that kid.

805
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,834
Who, Charlie?
-See?

806
01:03:41,869 --> 01:03:44,248
It's cute you're trying to make me jealous.

807
01:03:44,301 --> 01:03:46,050
She's trying to get my attention.

808
01:03:46,068 --> 01:03:48,570
I've got it, you're here.
I'm here, hello.

809
01:03:48,597 --> 01:03:50,547
Kadee, is this true?

810
01:03:50,591 --> 01:03:53,241
You're totally right, what was i thinking?

811
01:03:53,285 --> 01:03:57,759
Why would Kadee Worth, the biggest star in the world,
hang out with someone who scrubs the floor i walk on?

812
01:03:57,802 --> 01:04:00,619
It's not like that. We just want you to focus
on your music.

813
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:03,658
Yes, your music.

814
01:04:03,684 --> 01:04:08,786
And us. I think we should do an exclusive
with the Hollywood VIP.

815
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:10,492
Why can't you be more grateful?

816
01:04:10,527 --> 01:04:12,882
Peopla are always telling me
how grateful i should be.

817
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:16,950
But how can i be grateful when i'm successful
at something that my heart just not in.

818
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:23,720
Charlie is cooler than everyone in this building combined.

819
01:04:23,755 --> 01:04:25,949
And he's gonna help me find Rags.

820
01:04:25,984 --> 01:04:28,424
We're gonna proof you guys wrong.

821
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:31,365
And Finn, here's an exclusive..

822
01:04:31,485 --> 01:04:33,893
We're done.

823
01:04:34,795 --> 01:04:38,204
Somone's got her crabby pants on today, right?

824
01:04:38,247 --> 01:04:42,079
Finn, go make a record or something.

825
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:43,513
really?

826
01:04:50,124 --> 01:04:52,547
No, no!

827
01:04:52,713 --> 01:04:57,035
Llyod, how many times are you
gonna mess up the snake?

828
01:04:57,502 --> 01:04:59,723
You're ruining the whole thing.

829
01:05:00,117 --> 01:05:02,507
You go right and then left.

830
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:05,787
When your brother goes left and then right.

831
01:05:08,065 --> 01:05:09,718
Take a break.

832
01:05:10,243 --> 01:05:12,255
I'm exhausted.

833
01:05:25,782 --> 01:05:27,424
Need any help?

834
01:05:27,879 --> 01:05:29,549
Excuse me?

835
01:05:30,398 --> 01:05:32,873
My dad was yelling at me again.

836
01:05:32,993 --> 01:05:35,229
I could use some company.

837
01:05:39,542 --> 01:05:44,513
You know, ever since that Rags guy showed up at the ball,
he's been worse than ever.

838
01:05:44,565 --> 01:05:46,229
Was Rags really that good?

839
01:05:46,273 --> 01:05:48,670
Oh yeah, you would have loved him.

840
01:05:48,696 --> 01:05:52,692
Plus, you're both have the same way of
marking up your shoes.

841
01:05:54,406 --> 01:05:57,653
Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.
-No way.

842
01:05:57,671 --> 01:06:01,292
Plus i kinda like it how it makes my dad so angry.

843
01:06:02,027 --> 01:06:03,837
Can i ask you something?

844
01:06:04,467 --> 01:06:07,108
Why don't you just tell Kadee?

845
01:06:07,371 --> 01:06:10,118
She's Kadee Worth,
she can have anybody.

846
01:06:10,374 --> 01:06:11,529
Maybe she wants you.

847
01:06:11,555 --> 01:06:16,672
Trust me, Lloyd, no girl's looking for a nobody from a horrible family.

848
01:06:17,154 --> 01:06:20,469
They want some good looking famous guy
who will be mean to them.

849
01:06:21,913 --> 01:06:24,096
Girls are weird like that.

850
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,256
What are you doing?

851
01:06:33,326 --> 01:06:36,151
You never know, until you try.

852
01:06:36,757 --> 01:06:38,769
Lloyd!
-I can keep picking up these glasses..

853
01:06:38,804 --> 01:06:42,443
And dropping them on this floor,
until you're telling me you're going for this girl.

854
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,617
Not gonna happen.

855
01:06:43,652 --> 01:06:45,017
What about the audition?

856
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:48,432
Obviously Rags won't be showing up,
but that's just how it's gonna have to be.

857
01:06:49,587 --> 01:06:53,108
No no!
-What is going on?

858
01:06:54,770 --> 01:06:57,867
Look at all these broken glasses.

859
01:06:57,937 --> 01:06:58,996
No no no..

860
01:06:59,014 --> 01:07:01,979
This is coming out of your pay.
-You don't pay me.

861
01:07:03,763 --> 01:07:06,250
Are you ready to focus
and rehearse with your brother?

862
01:07:06,294 --> 01:07:10,694
Yeah, just making sure this grunt muffin
doesn't break all our glasses.

863
01:07:10,738 --> 01:07:13,784
That's my boy.
-I'll be right there.

864
01:07:16,225 --> 01:07:19,717
I'm sorry, i didn't mean to do that.
You know you're not a grunt muffin, right?

865
01:07:19,761 --> 01:07:22,648
I don't even know what a grunt muffin is.

866
01:07:24,994 --> 01:07:26,490
Gross.

867
01:07:26,525 --> 01:07:28,685
What is this stuff?

868
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,456
Come on!

869
01:07:53,475 --> 01:07:55,732
What's the cheapest one you got?

870
01:07:57,515 --> 01:07:59,002
What?

871
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:02,334
Something interesting has come up.

872
01:08:02,597 --> 01:08:04,446
I'll call you back.

873
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:06,536
This better be good.

874
01:08:15,935 --> 01:08:17,473
Nice.

875
01:08:17,709 --> 01:08:19,581
Nice..

876
01:08:28,365 --> 01:08:30,301
Excited?
-Nervous.

877
01:08:30,371 --> 01:08:33,100
I don't know why,
i've been in front of huge crowds.

878
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:35,007
I guess this time it's just different.

879
01:08:35,059 --> 01:08:37,973
Well, i have nothing but fate in you.

880
01:08:38,174 --> 01:08:40,055
Just be you.

881
01:08:40,536 --> 01:08:41,490
What?

882
01:08:41,525 --> 01:08:43,746
Charlie?
-Kadee?

883
01:08:45,128 --> 01:08:46,685
What are you doing here?

884
01:08:46,729 --> 01:08:47,708
Auditioning.

885
01:08:47,769 --> 01:08:49,195
What are you doing here?

886
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:51,731
You don't miss an opportunity, do you?

887
01:08:51,775 --> 01:08:54,871
Dad is looking for you, he said it's important.
He's upstairs.

888
01:08:55,772 --> 01:08:57,189
Okay.

889
01:09:08,591 --> 01:09:11,183
You're pretty crafty, Charlie.

890
01:09:11,305 --> 01:09:15,495
You know, sometimes i think i underestimated you.

891
01:09:15,854 --> 01:09:19,877
Thanks, though most of the time i think
you just overestimate yourself.

892
01:09:19,904 --> 01:09:23,131
Hey, i'm trying to be nice here.

893
01:09:23,822 --> 01:09:25,622
I got something for you.

894
01:09:25,648 --> 01:09:27,756
Come on, i'll show you.
-Okay.

895
01:09:27,773 --> 01:09:31,117
My friend Charlie.. Right here.

896
01:09:31,152 --> 01:09:34,231
Woo.. Hey!

897
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:36,965
So you think you're a singer, Charlie?

898
01:09:36,983 --> 01:09:40,035
How dare you try to steal your brothers' dream.

899
01:09:40,155 --> 01:09:42,604
By they way, i'm selling the Palace.

900
01:09:42,647 --> 01:09:46,890
They're gonna turn it into an auto-part store,
maybe they need a janitor.

901
01:09:47,598 --> 01:09:52,752
Now, if you'll excuse me, i have to introduce Andrew to the world as Rags.

902
01:09:52,796 --> 01:09:54,449
No!

903
01:09:55,216 --> 01:09:57,332
Where's Charlie?

904
01:10:02,265 --> 01:10:04,093
I won't let you stop this.

905
01:10:04,128 --> 01:10:06,210
Who says i'm here to stop this?
-Here to stop this?

906
01:10:06,227 --> 01:10:08,444
You wanna help me find Rags?

907
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:10,543
I'm sorry i haven't been listening to you.

908
01:10:10,587 --> 01:10:12,634
I need to do that more.

909
01:10:13,473 --> 01:10:16,827
What happened to my dad?
Is your head on straight?

910
01:10:16,947 --> 01:10:19,075
I think it finally is.

911
01:10:23,251 --> 01:10:25,735
And i think that..
-That i'm in love with Irma.

912
01:10:53,648 --> 01:10:56,220
I'm sorry.
Next.

913
01:11:01,097 --> 01:11:03,485
I'm sorry..
Next.

914
01:11:09,578 --> 01:11:11,510
It's done.

915
01:11:12,285 --> 01:11:17,949
Andrew, consider tonight the first night
of the rest of your career.

916
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,888
What about my career?
What about Androyd?

917
01:11:22,287 --> 01:11:24,936
It's a solo act now, bro.
You're just back up.

918
01:11:24,999 --> 01:11:27,513
Tonight, i'm Rags.

919
01:11:27,891 --> 01:11:29,305
What?

920
01:11:31,503 --> 01:11:33,525
I'm not even surprised.

921
01:11:38,144 --> 01:11:41,643
Help! Help!
Please help me!

922
01:11:41,763 --> 01:11:44,529
Trumpet! It's me, go get help boy!

923
01:11:44,595 --> 01:11:47,358
Go go go!

924
01:11:50,436 --> 01:11:53,042
I'm bored.

925
01:11:53,357 --> 01:11:55,702
Bored.

926
01:11:56,029 --> 01:11:58,570
Let's get out of here.

927
01:11:59,728 --> 01:12:02,412
People are singing.

928
01:12:15,204 --> 01:12:20,160
Baby, you're ready to call it quits?
-Not quite yet, dad.

929
01:12:26,663 --> 01:12:30,718
So, Rags seems to be on the shy side.

930
01:12:30,838 --> 01:12:34,658
Maybe i'll sing a little and that'll show you how it's done.

931
01:13:43,263 --> 01:13:44,940
You're Rags?

932
01:13:44,982 --> 01:13:46,270
You heard the song, didn't you?

933
01:13:46,312 --> 01:13:49,124
But you sounded so different
at the masquerade party.

934
01:13:49,197 --> 01:13:52,529
Different lyrics,
and the acoustic here stinks.

935
01:13:54,281 --> 01:13:55,884
Trumpet, what has gotten into you?

936
01:13:55,905 --> 01:13:58,933
It's me, please get me out of here!
-Charlie?

937
01:13:59,053 --> 01:14:02,381
You gotta get me out of here, please help!
-Okay!

938
01:14:06,133 --> 01:14:08,228
Will this help?
-No.

939
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:11,717
I got this.

940
01:14:14,205 --> 01:14:17,118
I totally help.
-Thank you.

941
01:14:17,238 --> 01:14:19,109
Go go go..

942
01:14:19,161 --> 01:14:20,792
Congratulations, i guess.

943
01:14:20,824 --> 01:14:22,867
My daugther sees something in you.

944
01:14:22,972 --> 01:14:26,399
And i'm the man of my word,
welcome to Majesty records.

945
01:14:26,416 --> 01:14:28,612
Thank you.

946
01:14:30,314 --> 01:14:34,119
The future of Majesty Records,
ladies and gentlemen.

947
01:14:39,531 --> 01:14:42,221
Looks like you're a little late.

948
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:47,532
Sorry Charlie..

949
01:15:15,691 --> 01:15:17,568
And now..

950
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:26,743
Welcome to the subway..

951
01:15:44,041 --> 01:15:45,653
Hey party pooper.

952
01:15:45,687 --> 01:15:50,105
You can't leave yet, we haven't introduced Rags, our guest of honor.

953
01:15:50,230 --> 01:15:52,854
You didn't really think you'd win, did you?

954
01:15:55,247 --> 01:15:57,828
Charlie, where are you going?

955
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:02,233
You can't leave.

956
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:04,153
Can't stay..

957
01:16:04,228 --> 01:16:07,004
Sort of done with this place.
- Wait..

958
01:16:07,124 --> 01:16:09,234
Can you do me a favor before you go?

959
01:16:09,485 --> 01:16:12,300
Stay while I introduce Rags.

960
01:16:12,953 --> 01:16:15,099
Couldn't found him without you.

961
01:16:26,097 --> 01:16:28,087
Excuse me..
Excuse me..

962
01:16:28,162 --> 01:16:31,406
And first of all thank you all for coming for this celebration.

963
01:16:31,526 --> 01:16:34,767
It's been a pretty wild ride, hasn't it everybody?
- Yeah..

964
01:16:34,809 --> 01:16:39,368
And what a crazy ending, who would've thought we'd actually find our Rags..

965
01:16:39,418 --> 01:16:41,497
But we did.

966
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:45,307
I knew Rags was incredibly talented the minute i heard him sing.

967
01:16:45,374 --> 01:16:48,961
I knew its lyrics would inspired others like they inspired me.

968
01:16:49,078 --> 01:16:53,738
But what took time to realize,
was that his friendship that change me the most.

969
01:16:54,145 --> 01:16:56,466
So, without further ado..

970
01:16:56,542 --> 01:16:59,341
Please put your hands together for the real Rags..

971
01:17:00,586 --> 01:17:03,009
The sign, i made him..

972
01:17:03,495 --> 01:17:05,948
Mr. Charlie Prince.

973
01:17:06,501 --> 01:17:07,909
- What?
- What?

974
01:17:07,968 --> 01:17:08,772
What?

975
01:17:08,848 --> 01:17:11,426
Charlie, it's time to be you.

976
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:17,507
Well, I'm sure we all enjoy and get laugh but I'm glad to be here and..

977
01:17:17,524 --> 01:17:19,405
I'm sorry for the confusion everyone..

978
01:17:19,455 --> 01:17:22,263
Charlie, get your butt up here.

979
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,718
- How did you know?
- Just be you?

980
01:17:32,768 --> 01:17:35,654
How could you think I wouldn't figure it out?

981
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:45,953
It's your stage, Charlie.

982
01:17:46,204 --> 01:17:47,881
Take it.

983
01:19:09,792 --> 01:19:11,465
Wait..wait..

984
01:19:12,219 --> 01:19:15,580
Look, I'm not the only artist here tonight though, folks.

985
01:19:15,655 --> 01:19:18,807
As the real Rags, it is my pleasure to give you..

986
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:21,265
The real Kadee Worth.

987
01:19:24,333 --> 01:19:26,172
Sing what you've sang to me.

988
01:19:26,189 --> 01:19:28,712
- Sing your song.
- I can't.

989
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:30,380
My dad has a plan.

990
01:19:30,389 --> 01:19:31,621
No sweetheart..

991
01:19:31,956 --> 01:19:33,701
I wanted to hear your song.

992
01:21:56,068 --> 01:21:58,239
And boy did i hear you, loud and clear.

993
01:21:58,359 --> 01:22:00,810
Loud and clear, jinx.

994
01:22:02,218 --> 01:22:05,652
And from now on, you're in charge in picking your own music.

995
01:22:06,414 --> 01:22:09,100
And thanks to you all and you Shawn..

996
01:22:09,318 --> 01:22:11,103
We found our real Rags.

997
01:22:11,397 --> 01:22:13,442
You're our next big star.

998
01:22:18,114 --> 01:22:20,120
Well at least we still got the Palace.

999
01:22:20,171 --> 01:22:22,677
Actually, no you don't.

1000
01:22:22,727 --> 01:22:24,096
What?

1001
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:25,538
What?

1002
01:22:25,588 --> 01:22:26,711
What are you talking about?

1003
01:22:26,745 --> 01:22:29,187
- You know exactly what i'm talking about.
- No Lloyd, don't.

1004
01:22:29,212 --> 01:22:31,006
No, okay?
NO! I..

1005
01:22:31,073 --> 01:22:32,917
I'm done lying for you.

1006
01:22:33,369 --> 01:22:37,278
Your mom didn't leave this place for our dad,
She left it for you, check the deed.

1007
01:22:37,303 --> 01:22:40,256
That is a lie.
You little traitor.

1008
01:22:40,307 --> 01:22:43,028
- I don't..
- This place is yours.

1009
01:22:43,087 --> 01:22:46,867
Charlie, you got your fairytale ending.

1010
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:49,092
Come here..

1011
01:22:49,922 --> 01:22:52,235
What am i suppose to do now?

1012
01:22:57,446 --> 01:23:00,049
And it's not over yet.

1013
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:11,318
So maybe life can be like a fairytale after all.

1014
01:26:11,536 --> 01:26:13,348
Do you have a dream?

1015
01:26:13,468 --> 01:26:16,014
Do you believe?

1016
01:26:21,306 --> 01:26:26,063
