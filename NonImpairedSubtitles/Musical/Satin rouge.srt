1
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,078
RED SATIN

2
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,598
And if I was really...

3
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,879
a liberated woman,

4
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,313
would that bother you?

5
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,833
That depends.

6
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,471
In that case,
I will be yours.

7
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,160
Monica was laughing.
Didn't you notice?

8
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,996
Why the irony?

9
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,109
Cause Rodrigo
likes interesting girls.

10
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,198
Come on, tell me.

11
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,916
The truth is, Belinda,
you watch too much TV...

12
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,793
Hi, Mom.

13
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,109
Why are you late?

14
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,716
I was talking with Hela.

15
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,196
Your friend whose folks
are aways? -That's her.

16
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,915
Eat Something.

17
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,639
Before you go to bed.

18
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,268
Okay. I ate.
-Very funny.

19
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,271
Is this how
it is going to be now?

20
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,919
I am really not hungry.

21
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,232
At least try your sweater on.

22
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,351
No, Mom. No.
-Look.

23
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,238
You know I don't like pink.

24
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,633
Good night.

25
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:14,199
How about going
to Rando and Pimpkys?

26
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,438
No, I don't want to.
I don't like them.

27
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,992
Fine. It's no big deal.

28
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,316
I don't want
to see them anymore.

29
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,870
Ok, all together now, as one.

30
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,833
In time.

31
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,430
Come on. Chins up.
Tuck in those bellies.

32
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,189
Make those arms graceful.

33
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,670
We turn again to the left.

34
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,751
Selma, to the left.

35
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,078
Come on girls, all in time.

36
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,872
All in time!

37
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,992
Lift your arms. Smile.

38
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,350
Come on, keep it up.

39
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,631
To the left... very good.

40
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,552
Sway the hips to and fro...

41
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,634
I don't believe it. My Mom!

42
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,398
What's up?
-Make like...

43
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,397
She saw me.

44
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,758
Okay, see you tomorrow.

45
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,878
You pick me up now?

46
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,195
For a change.

47
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,559
Are you meeting someone?

48
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,751
No, she's not there.

49
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,473
How's school? You managing?

50
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,989
Yes, but the third term
is harder.

51
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,354
We have got more subjects.

52
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,391
You will have to work harder.

53
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,629
Which reminds me...

54
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,950
I am studying at Helas.
It's quieter.

55
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,717
It's quiet here too.

56
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,989
Mom, her parents are away.

57
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,148
So who's minding the house?

58
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,234
Her older brother.

59
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,954
Good night.

60
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,712
Hello. Two kilos
of oranges, please.

61
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,075
What's that?

62
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,033
It's brand new.

63
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,310
Sure, that's why it's all
rusty and the brakes are shot.

64
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,433
Your change, Madam.

65
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,793
I need the money.

66
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,953
How much do we give him?

67
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,275
He can have 280,
but that's it.

68
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,315
Okay, done. Thanks.

69
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,357
Thanks, guys.

70
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,116
Excuse me,
you dropped your oranges.

71
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,516
Mom.
-Where are you?

72
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,279
Helas birthday party.
-So late?

73
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,508
How will you get home?

74
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,918
I'm spending the night here.

75
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,478
And what's that music?

76
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,319
Hello? I can't hear you...

77
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,158
Can I offer you a drink?

78
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,233
Hello, beauty.

79
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,474
What are you looking for?

80
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,268
Look at the state she is in.

81
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,713
Poor thing.
-You know her?

82
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,398
Never seen her before.

83
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,278
Let me have a look.

84
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,437
Go on, leave her alone.

85
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,073
Get moving.

86
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,468
Everyone out
of my dressing room.

87
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,876
To hell with you. Out!

88
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,633
Who do you think you are?

89
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,679
Feel any better?

90
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,999
You okay, honey?
What happened to you?

91
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,194
What are you doing here?

92
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,118
I'm looking for my daughter.

93
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,077
Here, in a cabaret?

94
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,510
And you fainted?
-I want to leave.

95
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,195
Don't fret. I'll show you
the way as soon

96
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,959
as my show terminated.

97
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,388
Relax.

98
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,431
I want to go home.

99
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,553
Don't worry. I will take you.

100
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,478
Give me a hand.

101
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,833
Quick, please. Thanks.

102
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,429
What's your name?

103
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,394
Lilia.

104
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,477
Want us to walk you home?
-No, thanks.

105
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,795
You will be okay?
-Yes, thanks.

106
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,029
Morning, Mom.

107
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,919
That hurt.

108
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,753
I'm sorry.

109
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,399
So I worry here all night,
and it doesn't matter to you?

110
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,394
It's not like that.
I'm really sorry.

111
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,990
Where were you?
-I told you.

112
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,350
With Hela and everyone
in the suburbs.

113
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,233
Never do that to me again.

114
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,109
All this because
I didn't sleep here.

115
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,758
I am not a baby anymore.

116
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,716
I am sorry Mom.

117
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,637
Good morning.
-Good morning.

118
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,196
How much is this?
-12 dinars a yard.

119
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,195
Look who's here.

120
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,029
Hi, young lady.

121
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,189
Hello.

122
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,396
You gave us a real scare.

123
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,995
I am sorry.

124
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,555
The smoke, the men,
the atmosphere...

125
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,159
I don't know...

126
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,079
You live around here?

127
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,198
No, I came for cloth.
I sew a little.

128
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,478
Really?
You are just what I need.

129
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,638
Nothing fits anymore.

130
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,114
The other night, onstage,
my top split open,

131
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,033
and I had to cover
my breasts with a fan.

132
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,438
It must have been awful!

133
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,279
Not at all.
They all loved it.

134
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,269
I got 1 47 dinars.

135
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,711
That's why I came
to buy new fabric.

136
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,591
Which do you like best?

137
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,359
That's the most cheerful.
-lt is nice.

138
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,757
I will take the Iot, thanks.

139
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,837
I wanted to tell you,
you were great.

140
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,515
You dance so well.

141
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,835
Thanks.

142
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,633
Come again sometime.

143
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,159
I don't know if I can.

144
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,995
I thought my daughter
hangs out there.

145
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,834
I get it.
You are a strict mother.

146
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,510
If you ever do feel like it,

147
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,199
you are my guest.

148
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,317
Okay. See you.

149
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,988
You like that?

150
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,636
Morning, Mom.
-Morning.

151
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,434
Up already?

152
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,069
Sleep well?

153
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,113
Yes... no.

154
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,195
Why?
-A bad nightmare woke me up.

155
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,672
Horrible things coming out
of the sea

156
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,677
and crawling along
the beach.

157
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,593
What kind of things?

158
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,156
Sticky creatures,
like snakes.

159
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,271
Have some coffee
and forget your snakes.

160
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,908
What are you doing today?

161
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,389
The usual.

162
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,313
I've got an early class.

163
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,631
I don't really want to go.

164
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,753
Hi, Lilia.

165
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,596
How are you doing?
-Not too bad.

166
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,757
I'm a Iittle bored, in fact.

167
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,956
I keep busy, knitting.

168
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,035
Which reminds me...

169
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,310
I have a gift for your daughter.
-How kind.

170
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,513
That's nice work.

171
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,791
Look how pretty it is, Zeinab.

172
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,599
You like it?

173
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,915
You know what?

174
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,195
She wanted a sweater
for 40 dinars!

175
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,198
What a waste!

176
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,199
What brand?

177
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,275
Naf-Naf.

178
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,637
See, that's all they know today.

179
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,798
Know what I found in her purse?

180
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,479
Lipstick.

181
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,396
And she's just 14.

182
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,835
What are we to do with these kids?

183
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,673
Be patient.

184
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,229
She's a good girl.
She won't do it again.

185
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,710
Try the sweater on
by the mirror.

186
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,791
Mine drives me crazy, too.

187
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,034
Good evening, Lilia.

188
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,350
What's wrong? What's up?

189
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,319
You look upset.

190
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,595
Salma's ill.

191
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,472
I'm off to the pharmacy.

192
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,269
All alone at this hour?

193
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,914
Mohammed can go with you.

194
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,868
Mohammed! Come here.

195
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,392
Where is he?
-I don't know.

196
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,038
Can we hurry a bit?
I want to see the game.

197
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,437
Go watch your game.
-You sure?

198
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,750
Stay here. Good night.

199
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,069
Fantastic,

200
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,038
but put in a couple
more stitches here.

201
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,633
Folla, you are next.

202
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,952
Coming.

203
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,789
You really dance well.

204
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,111
Sorry. I'll take it right off.

205
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,956
Leave it on. Let's have a look.
Turn around. You look great.

206
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,634
Let's surprise them.

207
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,994
I can't go out like this.

208
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,832
It was just to see.

209
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,756
Don't play the nervous virgin.

210
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,189
The clients are leaving.
Come on!

211
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,199
Hey! Here's our new star.

212
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,437
Shokri, play something.

213
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,835
The darbouka, please!

214
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,472
This is my place.

215
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,118
Come on.

216
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,388
Good night.

217
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,509
Good night.

218
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,715
The evening's over?

219
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,558
Well, good night then.

220
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,875
What's the matter?

221
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,116
You are still in bed.
I was worried.

222
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,469
Don't worry.
I didn't sleep well.

223
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,874
I had a toothache.

224
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,993
You are not being reasonable.
Go see the dentist.

225
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,633
And you? You okay?

226
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,996
You know, sometimes
I feel past it.

227
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,589
That's normal,
we're not the same age.

228
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,635
I'm off. My class starts early.

229
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,318
What a lovely dress.
Who's it for?

230
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,676
Madam Kamoun wanted
some alterations.

231
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,799
But this isn't hers.

232
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,232
There's a lot of perfume
on that.

233
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,439
Hi, Salma.

234
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,153
Are you better now?

235
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,159
Kids pay no mind to their health

236
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,638
and mothers worry.
Think about yours.

237
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,756
Here. T ake it back.
-It's a gift.

238
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,712
It's not for me.

239
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,228
Or I'm not for it.

240
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,873
Let's dance together.

241
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,394
I just came to give you the dress.
I have to see a client.

242
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,077
It will be fun.
We will drive them crazy.

243
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,109
Put that down.

244
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,675
Hey, girls! Come on!

245
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,113
Isn't that your costume?

246
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,195
So what?

247
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,992
Help her get into it.

248
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,637
We're gonna have a ball.

249
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,677
Faster, faster.

250
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,950
Let me help.

251
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,798
Turn around.

252
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,471
It's gotta be tighter.

253
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,999
Easy...

254
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,436
The color suits you.

255
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,630
And shake those breasts!

256
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,472
Let's get it done up
before she starts.

257
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,990
Lift your head.

258
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,318
Here, take this hair clip.

259
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,879
Look at this hair!

260
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,072
Yeah, just like silk!

261
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,071
Just look at that gem.

262
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,152
Tighter!

263
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,639
Good. Is that okay?

264
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,031
Wait a bit.

265
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,878
Bank notes galore tonight!

266
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,151
For us too, I hope.
-Of course!

267
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,993
Just look at that lovely smile!

268
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,558
Don't be afraid. It's easy.

269
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,429
Follow me.

270
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,754
I was ridiculous!

271
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,072
Ridiculous? Are you kidding?
Wild, maybe.

272
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,595
Didn't you hear the applause?

273
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,312
I heard nothing.
I saw nothing.

274
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,709
You were ecstatic, as if...

275
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,995
Ask Shokri.

276
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,758
He never saw anything like it.

277
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,189
I'm so ashamed.

278
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,756
What do you think?

279
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,712
Lovely and talented,
with fire in her blood.

280
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,591
But she dances for herself.
No technique.

281
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,634
It gets away from you.

282
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,713
But this isn't a game.

283
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,828
There's an audience.

284
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,076
It's not you in front
of your mirror.

285
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,119
Let me be frank.

286
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,719
We're all artists here.

287
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,548
Understand?
-Yes. You are the manager.

288
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,434
So, you will take her?

289
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,474
We will see.

290
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,597
But she's got to learn
how to move.

291
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,711
Move your hips up and down.

292
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,115
Now...

293
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,915
Backwards...

294
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,873
Lift up your hair.
Show some neck.

295
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,076
One... two...

296
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,715
Look in front of you.
Smile at the customers,

297
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,755
part your lips a little.

298
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,155
Move. Go on!

299
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,999
On your toes.

300
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,314
I'm exhausted.

301
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,953
Dancing is hard work.

302
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,951
What did you think?

303
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,709
I will be right back.

304
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,549
Thanks.

305
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,274
Make yourself at home.

306
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,949
Let's cool off.

307
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,593
How long have you been
at the cabaret?

308
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,634
Almost fifteen years.

309
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,711
I'm part of the scenery now.
I'II be kicked out soon.

310
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,789
He wouldnt! You are the star.

311
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,234
Star? You are kidding.

312
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,318
I heard he's getting new girls.

313
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,755
Blonde and cheap.

314
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,949
Don't look so shocked.
That's life.

315
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,634
Drink your drink.

316
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,237
If I'm boring you,
just say so.

317
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,949
What's wrong?

318
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,918
You keep looking
at your watch.

319
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,193
I don't want to be Iate.

320
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,358
Thanks for the information,

321
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,478
it's like making love
with a stop watch.

322
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,668
You think it's easy.

323
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,997
Studying and going out
with a musician?

324
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,029
It's my job.

325
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,558
To be in love
behind everyone's back,

326
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,716
especially my mother.
It's torture.

327
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,715
Why don't you tell her?

328
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,669
You are crazy.

329
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,155
It'd kill her.
I'm all she's got.

330
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,360
If she remarries,
that'd fix everything.

331
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,909
You don't know her.

332
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,559
Her life is dedicated

333
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,033
to my father's memory.

334
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,239
She talks to him...

335
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,354
I mean, to his photo.

336
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,949
She says all sorts of stuff,
like he'd answer.

337
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,553
Maybe she hears him?

338
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,229
Maybe.

339
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,958
I've got to go.

340
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,595
Mom...

341
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,318
You didn't finish my dress.

342
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,439
I'm sorry.
I had so much work.

343
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,518
For the neighbour
who never pays.

344
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,275
I promise I'II do it soon.

345
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,349
Please. I need it.
Make an effort.

346
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,351
The black bra. How much is it?
-120 dinars.

347
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,315
For you, Madam?

348
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,555
Yes, as usual.

349
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,309
Could you call a cab?
-Right away.

350
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,755
Two minutes, Madam.

351
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,671
Can I help you?

352
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,554
Thank God. You are back.

353
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,429
Leaving your daughter out
at this hour?

354
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,393
It's not right.

355
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,637
I visited a sick friend.

356
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,954
How are you?
How's the family?

357
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,998
Everyone's well,
and sends you their regards.

358
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,709
Where are your keys?

359
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,429
Why are you late?

360
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,192
Well I never... Since when
must I make excuses to you?

361
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,752
I'm the one who's been
stuck with him.

362
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,678
I can't take any more.

363
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,155
Get your uncle some tea.
I'll make dinner.

364
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,989
No, thanks.
An orange will do.

365
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,874
Mom, you bought new shoes?

366
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,555
Yes.

367
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,999
They are really shiny.

368
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,713
You want them to be invisible?

369
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,995
It's the style.

370
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,592
Women and fashion. My God.

371
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,109
Let's have a look.

372
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,508
Now that's a shoe.

373
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,551
Can you walk on those heels?

374
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,233
They are very comfortable.

375
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,591
Like being barefoot.
-Barefoot?

376
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,509
They are real nice.

377
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,711
T ry them on.
-Not now.

378
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,949
Come on.

379
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,957
Show us how you walk in them.

380
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,434
They are great.

381
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,079
I'll go and make dinner.

382
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,678
May God hear your prayers.

383
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:58,709
Here kid...

384
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,031
And for your mother.

385
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,952
This child does not eat.

386
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,718
She's even thinner than before.

387
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,635
Good night.

388
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,831
Why watch that?

389
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,918
Luckily, she's gone to bed.

390
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,158
Salma's nice and obedient.

391
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,395
Thank God.

392
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,319
But she' s tired.
Her eyes have bags.

393
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,112
You have too!

394
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,278
Come more often to the village.

395
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,830
We should.
But I've so much to do here.

396
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,275
Here. Eat.

397
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,269
More coffee?

398
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,156
I'm going. I'll be late.

399
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,751
Wait for me.
I'm going too.

400
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,235
It's time.

401
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,712
The harvest wasn't good.

402
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,996
Thanks. Give all my regards.

403
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,189
I'II tell them.

404
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,072
T ake care of yourself
and the kid.

405
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,954
Bye.

406
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,398
You should have worn
something else.

407
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,110
Button it!
-Button it? Me?

408
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,553
The dress, not your mouth.

409
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,431
Finally, you're here!
I was worried.

410
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,834
I had family over.

411
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,714
You'll tell me later.

412
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,236
Change. We have got work.

413
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,033
How much did he give you?

414
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,349
200 dinars.

415
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,357
What? Count it again,
you never know.

416
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,395
It looks right.

417
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,517
What a meany!
You have got admirers.

418
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,837
They come to see you
and he knows it.

419
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,234
It's wrong, cheating her.

420
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,071
She's been slaving
for three weeks.

421
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,148
It's hard times for everyone.

422
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,633
Phone, rent,

423
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,079
taxes...

424
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,636
Exactly. Hard times
for everyone.

425
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,109
Okay.

426
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,073
You two can have
another forty.

427
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,193
God will repay you.

428
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,593
Twenty each.
It's better than nothing.

429
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,394
How much did you get?

430
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,229
The usual.

431
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,911
We're on in ten minutes.

432
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,470
We'll work them up tonight
like they have never been.

433
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,438
Who? -The clients.
Who'd you think?

434
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,869
Where do you think we are?

435
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,837
Don't look at me like that.
-Why not?

436
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,229
T ell me... you have
got a girl, don't you?

437
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,355
Yeah.

438
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:25,875
I know a girl.

439
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,395
Do you love her?

440
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,999
Yes, but...

441
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,439
it's complicated.

442
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,352
She's all her mother's got.

443
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:49,755
You know...

444
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,519
Ever since I saw you dance,

445
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,718
I can't take my mind off you.

446
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,750
Lilia, you are on! Now!

447
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,718
I love dancing.
-ls that so?

448
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:06,150
No kidding.
Weddings, cabarets...

449
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:10,037
Sweetie, a client
wants to meet you.

450
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,035
Listen.

451
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,355
This is serious.

452
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:19,030
Make an effort to be nice.
-What do you mean, nice?

453
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:22,476
Don't play the shy virgin.

454
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,917
He wants you to dance
at his home,

455
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,510
in private.
-His home?

456
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,548
I dance here, for the clients.

457
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:31,915
I'm an artist.

458
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,439
He is too, in a way.

459
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,953
He pays well.

460
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,068
Listen.

461
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,429
I tell you. Don't be afraid.

462
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,478
See that Mercedes?

463
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,474
It's mine.

464
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,352
Let go of me.
I want to go home.

465
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:01,916
I know. The boss told me
you were not like the rest.

466
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,633
I'm different too.

467
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,391
Let's get to know each other.

468
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:08,995
You would not be sorry.

469
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,229
Let go of me.

470
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,194
I'll take you home.

471
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,511
Maybe you will change
your mind.

472
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,350
Come on, let's go.

473
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:25,915
Don't look like that.

474
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,235
What's going on?
What does he want?

475
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,678
I'm doing business with the lady.

476
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:33,754
What business?

477
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,989
Is she your sister?
Girlfriend, wife?

478
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,309
Piss off!

479
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,837
Piss off?
She's my sister-in-law.

480
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,676
Her husband's a karate teacher.

481
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,638
Would you like to meet him?

482
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:07,589
I'm just about home.
Thank you.

483
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,068
Good night then.

484
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:15,548
Good night to you.

485
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,229
Hi, Lilia.

486
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:33,508
Hi, come on in.

487
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,910
It's been a while
since I've seen you.

488
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,639
I see Salma every morning.

489
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,274
You are so busy...

490
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:41,469
Not at all.

491
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,228
You know, Lilia,

492
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:51,989
I think Salma smokes.

493
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,388
What do you mean?

494
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:56,748
What do I mean?

495
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,033
Yesterday...

496
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,470
I smelled cigarette smoke again.

497
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,553
Times change.

498
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,394
You're right.

499
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,633
I should be more careful.

500
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,429
Want some tea?

501
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,478
She's grown so quickly.
Such a lovely flower.

502
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,238
Sometimes...

503
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:21,151
I see her with a young man.
He's family, perhaps?

504
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,469
T all, thin...
-I will make tea.

505
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:26,273
Lilia, I'm telling you...

506
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:35,990
It's a dangerous age.
You have to watch her carefully.

507
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,438
It's not easy for you,
a woman alone.

508
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,637
I put myself in your place.

509
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,159
Believe me...
-Thanks.

510
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:47,469
I'm sorry.

511
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,279
What are you doing here?

512
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,638
Just visiting.
-Later, Okay?

513
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,274
You don't want to see me?
-Of course!

514
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,552
Are you coming tonight?
Yes or no?

515
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,753
I don't think so.
I don't feel like going out.

516
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,271
You look so tired.

517
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,833
Doesn't she?

518
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,435
She hasn't been in
good form these days.

519
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,356
She lets it all out at night.

520
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,391
Lets it all out? Where?

521
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,428
At the cabaret.

522
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,079
The cabaret?

523
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,439
I'II make the tea.

524
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,030
She alters my dance outfits.

525
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,878
I'm a cabaret dancer.

526
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:38,910
The cabaret, right near here.

527
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,596
Know it?
-Certainly not!

528
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,635
Maybe not, but your
husband must.

529
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:46,715
My husband?

530
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:51,152
Of course. But he does not
tell you. I know men.

531
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:54,949
This is a bad dream!
Where'd she come from?

532
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,475
Hi, Fola.
-How you doing?

533
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,191
The friend I mentioned.
-Charmed.

534
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,470
Do your best on her.

535
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,471
What's her name?
-Lilia.

536
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,039
Hi Lilia.

537
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,355
Where have you been?

538
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,950
The usual... the cabaret...

539
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,352
Want a cigarette?
-Oh yes.

540
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,990
Your flame is out.
-lt lights at night.

541
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,478
So this is our new star?

542
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:50,196
What would you like?
-I don't know.

543
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,668
A new haircut?
Like Barbarita in the series?

544
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:59,193
A cut like this?
-Yes.

545
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,152
That'll be just perfect for you.

546
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,348
Is that you in the photo?

547
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,511
Yes, in my last show.

548
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,671
You look great!

549
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:09,949
She should've come.

550
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:12,079
The place was packed.

551
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,192
She's shy, our friend.

552
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,279
What are you looking at?

553
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,478
It suits you,
that new hairdo.

554
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,909
Think so?

555
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:39,792
You look young.
-Don't fib.

556
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,234
No, really.

557
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,274
You're pretty, like this.

558
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:47,275
You should dress more modern.

559
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:49,758
Like your hairdo and your shoes.

560
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,670
Yesterday I got a bag.
-Let's see.

561
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:05,349
It's lovely.

562
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:11,357
Met someone?
-Don't be so curious.

563
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,873
You could tell me.

564
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,399
Don't talk nonsense.

565
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,191
But it'd be terrific!

566
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,676
You're prettier than ever,
recently.

567
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:23,795
The bag, the shoes,
the hairdo...

568
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:30,112
Can I study at Hela's tonight?
If you like, she can come here.

569
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,953
You can go to her place.
But I prefer you sleep over.

570
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,877
Really? You sure?

571
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,036
I won't worry so much
like that.

572
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:03,478
"To determine the mass
of a steel ball.

573
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,273
You remember that class?

574
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,512
"First, using a balance..."

575
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:15,914
What's he up to?

576
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:17,794
He was supposed to meet me.

577
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:18,909
It's still early.

578
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,674
You know
he is at the cabaret.

579
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,399
"First, using the balance,

580
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,637
"measure the water displaced..."

581
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,794
Hello, Mom?
-Hello, sweetheart.

582
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,911
Did I wake you?
-No.

583
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:46,398
Did you study well?
-Yeah, we did.

584
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,352
Your voice sounds strange.

585
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,039
It's okay.

586
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,392
I didn't sleep well.

587
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:58,115
Mom?

588
01:22:58,600 --> 01:22:59,669
Yes.

589
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:01,757
It's something important.

590
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:04,912
Are you listening?

591
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:06,355
Yes.

592
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:10,790
At the dance class,
I met a boy.

593
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:13,952
We are in love.

594
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,190
I want to introduce him to you,

595
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:19,918
If that's okay with you.

596
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,833
All right.

597
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,514
What are you doing here?

598
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,557
I wanted to surprise you.

599
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:40,794
What have you done?

600
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:43,471
I tidied up. What's wrong?

601
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:58,908
I think we should
stop seeing each other.

602
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,909
Don't you ring?
-I never do.

603
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,355
Yes, but today...
-She expects us.

604
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:51,958
Mom, this is Shokri.

605
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,119
Charmed.

606
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:58,434
Please sit down.

607
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:16,833
So, you are Shokri?

608
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:21,953
You have nothing to say?

609
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:24,719
Excuse me, Madam.

610
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,632
I didn't think...

611
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,273
You didn't think what?

612
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:36,279
I didn't imagine
Salma's mother like you.

613
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:38,835
Did you think I was a dragon?

614
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:44,316
If dragons looked like you...

615
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,870
I'm just talking nonsense.

616
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,278
Salma dances as well as you.

617
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:54,317
What's that supposed to mean?

618
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:56,991
I meant...

619
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:01,348
Seeing you, I can see
why she's so gifted.

620
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:03,676
You know how to make compliments.

621
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:07,074
He writes lyrics for songs

622
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:08,679
with a composer.

623
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,597
Go get us some tea

624
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,631
while I talk to Shokri.

625
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:14,637
Unless you want
something else?

626
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:16,592
No, tea's fine.

627
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:23,834
She is singing.

628
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,078
She is happy.

629
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:34,829
Relax.

630
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,951
Think how it was
at the cabaret.

631
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:39,316
We will learn
how to get along.

632
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:42,077
I will be an excellent
mother-in-law.

633
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:45,712
I'm sure, Madam.

634
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:48,590
Lilia. What's this Madam?

635
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:52,832
I'm sure, Lilia.

636
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,479
Please.

637
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:11,719
