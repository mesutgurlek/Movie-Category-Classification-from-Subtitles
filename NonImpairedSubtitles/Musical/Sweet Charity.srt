1
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:17,631
Oh, Charlie, I'm on time, right?

2
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:20,767
Wrong. You know what I did today?
I looked at furniture.

3
00:05:20,878 --> 00:05:25,838
At couches that turn into beds
and chairs that turn into beds
and lamps that turn into beds.

4
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:31,148
And then, you know, I went
to look at wedding rings. And
then... look. For my trousseau.

5
00:05:31,255 --> 00:05:34,122
And you know, Charlie,
that's not all I did today.

6
00:05:34,224 --> 00:05:37,523
I went to the bank, you know?
And I took every last cent I own...

7
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:40,153
All $427.

8
00:05:40,264 --> 00:05:43,461
So now we can put
a down payment on something.

9
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:48,372
Oh, Charlie, it's such
a great world, isn't it?

10
00:05:48,372 --> 00:05:48,770
Oh, Charlie, it's such
a great world, isn't it?

11
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:53,900
Today I feel New York is
really my personal property

12
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:56,741
Right down Broadway
to City Hall

13
00:05:58,615 --> 00:06:01,311
Every supermarket
every five and ten

14
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:04,251
All of Lincoln Center
and the great U.N.

15
00:06:04,354 --> 00:06:08,120
They're all my personal property

16
00:06:10,594 --> 00:06:15,622
The zoo in Central Park is
merely my private menagerie

17
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:18,600
I've carved my name on every tree

18
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:22,971
From Yonkers Raceway
to Bowling Green

19
00:06:23,073 --> 00:06:25,701
I own everything around
and in between

20
00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:30,143
It's all my personal property

21
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:36,580
The planetarium is mine alone

22
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:41,386
The old aquarium I also own

23
00:06:41,492 --> 00:06:48,125
And since I feel today New York
is really my personal property

24
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:50,894
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do

25
00:06:52,436 --> 00:06:55,496
Since I like you very much

26
00:06:55,606 --> 00:06:57,733
So very, very much

27
00:06:59,143 --> 00:07:02,010
I'm gonna split it with you

28
00:07:03,947 --> 00:07:06,609
With you

29
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,117
With you

30
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:11,881
With you

31
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:13,889
With you

32
00:07:17,761 --> 00:07:21,162
<i>Hey, Charlie, you know,
this is my own personal,
private wishing well.</i>

33
00:07:21,265 --> 00:07:23,790
Hey! Let's make a wish...

34
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,369
and then throw somethin' in
after for luck.

35
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,304
Since I like you very much

36
00:07:30,407 --> 00:07:32,432
<i>So very, very much</i>

37
00:07:33,877 --> 00:07:37,142
I'm gonna give it

38
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:40,273
To...

39
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:42,375
I wish...

40
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:45,751
Oh! Help!

41
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:48,950
<i>Help! I can't...
I can't swim!</i>

42
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:51,357
Help! I can't...

43
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:55,056
<i>Help! I can't...
I can't swim! Help me!</i>

44
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:58,134
Look, Walter. There's
a girl in there drowning.
Don't look, dear.

45
00:07:58,235 --> 00:08:00,135
But, Walter!
Don't look, I tell you.

46
00:08:00,237 --> 00:08:02,398
Don't get involved.
It's none of our business.

47
00:08:02,506 --> 00:08:04,906
Oh!

48
00:08:11,682 --> 00:08:14,674
Oh, God.

49
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:27,395
Here, help! Somebody help!
Somebody grab her ankles.

50
00:08:27,497 --> 00:08:31,524
<i>She looks dead.
Doesn't she look dead to you?</i>

51
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:33,569
I don't know.
I've never seen her before.

52
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:37,606
Shake her well 'til
the water is out.
She's coming to.

53
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:42,702
<i>Oh, my God! I'm in Australia!
Put me down!</i>

54
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,338
Put me down!

55
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:49,146
What do you think you're doing?
Go away! Don't look at me!

56
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:52,689
Don't look at me!
Take it easy, honey.
You almost drowned.

57
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:55,917
- Charlie. Where's Charlie?
- I bet she tried to knock herself off.

58
00:08:56,026 --> 00:08:58,426
Apparently over
a fellow named Charlie.

59
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:01,326
Who took my shoe?
Where's my shoe?

60
00:09:03,634 --> 00:09:07,661
Well, don't stare at me.
Don't stare at me.
Please leave me alone.

61
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,375
Please leave me alone!

62
00:09:13,477 --> 00:09:16,913
Come on, everybody!
Let's all go home! Break it up!
Move it back.

63
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,881
Charlie! Why did you
do it, Charlie?

64
00:09:19,983 --> 00:09:23,111
The aquacade is all over.
Hey, be careful.
She's a crazy lady.

65
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,984
Let's go now.
Come on.
Hey, you all right, miss?

66
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:28,649
I'm fine.
I'm just fine.

67
00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:34,930
Just put it down in your book.
The crazy, drowned lady feels fine.

68
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:38,331
All right, miss. Would you care to
tell us what happened?

69
00:09:40,003 --> 00:09:43,029
I lost my shoe.
That's what happened.

70
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,938
Hey, Monte, look for
her other shoe, will you?

71
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,011
Yeah, Monte, look for
her other shoe.

72
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:51,774
What's it look like?
It looks like that one.

73
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:55,147
What does it look like.
All right, miss.
What's your name?

74
00:09:55,252 --> 00:09:57,413
Charity.

75
00:09:57,521 --> 00:10:00,456
Charity Hope Valentine.

76
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:02,718
Charity Hope Valentine?

77
00:10:02,826 --> 00:10:05,192
<i>Just write it.
Just...
Here it is. I found it.</i>

78
00:10:05,295 --> 00:10:07,525
Address?

79
00:10:07,631 --> 00:10:09,531
615 West 44th Street.

80
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:12,761
Occupation?
Social consultant.

81
00:10:12,869 --> 00:10:16,305
Where?
The Fandango Ballroom.

82
00:10:16,406 --> 00:10:18,306
Dance hall hostess.

83
00:10:18,475 --> 00:10:20,807
<i>Oh, you mean you work in
one of those tango palaces.</i>

84
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,812
<i>It's temporary.
Length of employment?</i>

85
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:27,645
<i>Eight years.
Suppose you tell me what
you were doin' in the water.</i>

86
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:33,053
<i>Oh, well, my fiancé,
Charlie... Well, he's not
exactly my fiancé exactly,</i>

87
00:10:33,156 --> 00:10:36,319
<i>but we are engaged
to be wed the minute
his own marriage breaks up.</i>

88
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:40,294
Anyway, we had this rendezvous
to meet in the park,

89
00:10:40,397 --> 00:10:44,333
and, uh, I was
just about to make a wish
by throwin' in this penny...

90
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:47,835
when... I don't know...
I guess I must have
slipped or somethin'...

91
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:52,307
'cause I lost my balance,
and anyway, naturally
he made a grab for me,

92
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:55,845
and all he caught
was my handbag, and I fell in.

93
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,938
<i>That's what happened.
Yeah, sure. Right.</i>

94
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:01,609
<i>Where's my hair spray?
Well, see, he couldn't
jump in after me...</i>

95
00:11:01,718 --> 00:11:04,186
'cause of his
bad back, you know.

96
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:06,187
Anyway, so he ran off
to get help.

97
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:09,156
Where'd he go?
The coast guard station
in Norfolk, Virginia?

98
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:13,889
Come on, honey. Didn't you
leave one tiny little detail
out of that story?

99
00:11:13,997 --> 00:11:17,524
- Like what?
- Like there ain't
one word of truth in it?

100
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:19,761
Hello, men.

101
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,601
<i>Hey, Nickie, did you hear about
Charity and her boyfriend?</i>

102
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:28,337
You're gonna get married.
Oh, all the luck in the world, baby.

103
00:11:28,445 --> 00:11:30,913
He stole her money
and pushed her in the lake.

104
00:11:31,014 --> 00:11:34,040
<i>He wasn't for you.
Excuse me, ladies.</i>

105
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,051
Prince Phillip
just walked in,

106
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,849
so park the gum behind your ears
and drag it out on the floor.

107
00:11:38,955 --> 00:11:42,152
Doesn't he ever knock?
It's a good thing
we're decent.

108
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:46,295
He's gonna call.
Who?

109
00:11:46,396 --> 00:11:49,422
Charlie. He's gonna call.
Any minute, he's gonna call,

110
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:54,027
and he's gonna have a very
perfectly logical explanation
for this whole thing.

111
00:11:54,137 --> 00:11:56,401
What did I tell ya?

112
00:11:57,841 --> 00:11:59,741
Charlie!

113
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:05,507
It's for you.
Yeah?

114
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:09,676
<i>You know what your big problem is?
You run your heart like a hotel.</i>

115
00:12:09,786 --> 00:12:12,277
You got guys checkin' in
and out all the time.

116
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:14,289
And you always
get stuck with the bill.

117
00:12:14,391 --> 00:12:17,121
This time it's different.
He loves me.

118
00:12:19,396 --> 00:12:24,197
I mean, when somebody has
their name tattooed on your arm
so it'll be there forever,

119
00:12:24,301 --> 00:12:29,568
does that sound like the sort
of fella who's gonna push you in
the lake for 427 measly bucks?

120
00:12:29,673 --> 00:12:31,698
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Right.

121
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:35,471
<i>- Where's my hair spray?
- Forget him, baby.
We got a livin' to make.</i>

122
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,604
If you call this
a living.

123
00:12:37,714 --> 00:12:40,444
He's gonna call.
You'll see.

124
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,450
Sure.

125
00:12:53,563 --> 00:12:56,999
<i>Since I like you
very much</i>

126
00:12:58,368 --> 00:13:02,099
So very, very much

127
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:04,537
I'm...

128
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:06,609
Oh, Charlie.

129
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:08,064
Hey, mister, can I talk
to you for a minute?
Got a cigarette for me, mister?

130
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:11,299
Hey, mister,
you speak Spanish?
Hey, tiger, you wanna dance?

131
00:14:11,408 --> 00:14:14,309
A little dance won't hurt you.
Come here, cowboy.
Wanna tell you somethin'.

132
00:14:14,411 --> 00:14:18,142
<i>Moshi, moshi, e'kaga
desu-ka, baby?
Ooh, you're so tall.</i>

133
00:14:18,248 --> 00:14:20,148
Let's have some fun.

134
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:23,446
Pssss.

135
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,356
The minute you walked
in the joint

136
00:14:34,464 --> 00:14:39,128
I could see you were
a man of distinction

137
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:42,728
A real big spender

138
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,739
Good lookin'

139
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:47,002
So refined

140
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:52,173
Say, wouldn't you like to know
what's goin' on in my mind

141
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:56,309
So let me get right
To the point

142
00:14:56,419 --> 00:14:58,319
I don't pop my cork

143
00:14:58,421 --> 00:15:03,916
For every guy I see

144
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:06,791
Hey, big spender

145
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:12,729
Spend

146
00:15:12,836 --> 00:15:15,771
A little time with

147
00:15:15,872 --> 00:15:18,204
Me

148
00:15:21,511 --> 00:15:23,741
Me

149
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:35,190
Do you wanna have fun

150
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:43,265
Psssss.

151
00:15:43,366 --> 00:15:45,357
How's about a few

152
00:15:45,468 --> 00:15:47,368
Laughs

153
00:15:49,005 --> 00:15:52,202
I can show you a

154
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:56,837
Good time

155
00:15:56,946 --> 00:16:00,279
Do you wanna have fun

156
00:16:00,383 --> 00:16:02,214
Fun, fun

157
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:04,879
<i>How's about a few
Fun</i>

158
00:16:04,988 --> 00:16:08,082
Laughs, laughs, laughs
Fun, fun, fun

159
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:12,025
- I can show you a
- Laughs, laughs
- Good time

160
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:14,619
- Fun
- Laughs
- Good time

161
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:16,995
- Fun
- Laughs
- Good time

162
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,591
Fun, laughs, good time

163
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,240
Pssss.

164
00:16:26,676 --> 00:16:28,667
What do you say to a...
How's about a...

165
00:16:28,778 --> 00:16:30,973
Laugh
I could give you some...

166
00:16:31,081 --> 00:16:33,709
Are you ready
for some...
Fun

167
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:36,183
How would you like a...
Let me show you a...

168
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:40,552
Good time
Hey, big spender

169
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:45,593
Hey, big spender

170
00:16:49,432 --> 00:16:52,299
The minute you walked
in the joint

171
00:16:53,737 --> 00:16:58,197
I could see you were
a man of distinction

172
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,675
A real big spender

173
00:17:01,778 --> 00:17:03,678
Good lookin'

174
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,271
So refined

175
00:17:06,383 --> 00:17:10,752
Say, wouldn't you like to know
what's goin' on in my mind

176
00:17:10,854 --> 00:17:14,915
So let me get right
To the point

177
00:17:15,024 --> 00:17:16,924
I don't pop my cork

178
00:17:17,026 --> 00:17:22,225
For every guy I see

179
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,960
Hey, big spender

180
00:17:27,804 --> 00:17:30,136
Hey, big spender

181
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,139
Hey, big spender

182
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:41,081
Spend

183
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:44,051
A little time with

184
00:17:44,154 --> 00:17:46,349
Me

185
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:48,981
Fun, laughs, good time

186
00:17:49,092 --> 00:17:51,560
Fun, laughs, good time

187
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:54,653
Fun, laughs, good time

188
00:17:54,764 --> 00:17:56,459
How's about it, palsie?

189
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:58,466
Yeah!

190
00:18:12,882 --> 00:18:14,782
Hey, Herman.
Huh?

191
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:17,114
Anybody been
askin' for me?
Uh-uh.

192
00:18:23,993 --> 00:18:27,861
<i>Face it, honey. Charlie the pusher
ain't comin' anymore.</i>

193
00:18:27,964 --> 00:18:30,728
Gee, what's the matter
with me? What am I?

194
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:33,359
Ooh, boy, am I stupid.
Boy, am I a pushover.

195
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:37,702
No, not a pushover exactly.
It's just that you're too...

196
00:18:37,807 --> 00:18:40,537
Well, I don't know.
You just keep on...

197
00:18:40,643 --> 00:18:44,773
Yeah, you're a pushover.
If he stole your purse, why
don't you call the cops?

198
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:48,874
They can always pick him up.
Girl, do you know how many guys
are runnin' around this city...

199
00:18:48,985 --> 00:18:50,885
carryin' pocketbooks?

200
00:18:50,987 --> 00:18:53,888
Why'd he do it?
Everything he ever
wanted, I bought him:

201
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:57,653
$11 shirts,
$79 Italian silk suits.

202
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,854
What'd I do wrong?

203
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:05,298
I'd even get up
in the middle of the night and
buy him his meatball sandwiches.

204
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:09,394
Boy, did he love
those meatball sandwiches.

205
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:12,475
Well, I have had it
up to here with that creep.

206
00:19:12,575 --> 00:19:14,475
Go, baby, go.
Now you're talkin'.

207
00:19:14,577 --> 00:19:19,071
He can go slip and slide his greasy head
on somebody else's shoulder.

208
00:19:19,182 --> 00:19:22,811
I'm finished!
I'm through, do you hear me?

209
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:25,854
I'm tired of buyin' him
pointed shoes...

210
00:19:25,955 --> 00:19:29,948
and his trips to Florida
and his three-horse parlays.

211
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:34,187
Think he is,
shovin' girls into lakes?

212
00:19:34,297 --> 00:19:36,731
Oh, boy, am I through givin'.

213
00:19:39,068 --> 00:19:43,630
Ooh, I hope your
tight Italian pants
choke you to death.

214
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,466
Get me a taxi!

215
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:27,339
Ursula, stop acting
like a child.

216
00:21:27,443 --> 00:21:29,570
Vittorio Vitale!

217
00:21:31,547 --> 00:21:34,846
Hey! That's Vittorio Vitale,
the Italian movie star!

218
00:21:34,951 --> 00:21:37,010
Ursula, I can
explain everything.

219
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,213
Don't touch me.
We're through.

220
00:21:39,322 --> 00:21:41,381
I hate you. Do you hear me?
I hate you.

221
00:21:41,491 --> 00:21:47,157
- She really knows him!
- Ursula, I merely said hello
to that girl. Hello!

222
00:21:47,263 --> 00:21:50,323
That's all!
I do not want
to discuss it.

223
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:52,765
Now you can't walk out
on me like this.

224
00:21:52,869 --> 00:21:55,235
I can't?
Well, just watch me.

225
00:21:55,338 --> 00:21:58,330
<i>Just watch me.
Watch! Watch!
You're not watching.</i>

226
00:21:58,441 --> 00:22:02,434
<i>Where's my taxi?
Taxi!</i>

227
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:05,446
<i>Taxi!</i>

228
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,648
You are coming
back inside.
I am not!

229
00:22:09,752 --> 00:22:11,652
Oh, yes, you are.
No, I'm not!

230
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:13,915
Yes, you are.
Ow!

231
00:22:17,393 --> 00:22:20,021
Ursula! Ursula!

232
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:22,029
Ursula!

233
00:22:27,203 --> 00:22:29,398
<i>Oh, scusi, signorina.
Scusi.</i>

234
00:22:29,505 --> 00:22:31,405
My pleasure.

235
00:22:58,935 --> 00:23:00,869
Are you busy tonight?

236
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:03,632
Hey, he wants to know
if you're busy tonight.

237
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,868
No, you.

238
00:23:06,976 --> 00:23:09,410
- Yes, you.
- Me?

239
00:23:09,512 --> 00:23:13,107
<i>- Are you busy tonight?
- What time?</i>

240
00:23:13,216 --> 00:23:16,674
Right now.
Right now is
very good for me.

241
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:18,686
Get in.

242
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,757
I'm with him.

243
00:23:34,737 --> 00:23:38,468
Oh, that girl.
She's driving me crazy.

244
00:23:38,574 --> 00:23:42,442
These wild fits of jealousy.
I can't stand it any longer.
She's impossible.

245
00:23:42,545 --> 00:23:46,174
That was my first impression.
Childish, neurotic,
selfish.

246
00:23:46,282 --> 00:23:48,580
That was my
second impression.

247
00:23:48,684 --> 00:23:51,312
Well, it's finished.

248
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,388
She's just not worth it.

249
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:58,358
Well, on the other hand,
you know, she's not so bad
in the looks department.

250
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:00,691
Ah, yes.
Yes, you're right.

251
00:24:00,797 --> 00:24:03,630
She is very beautiful.
Well, I mean, if you go
for that sort of thing.

252
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,668
No, you are right.
You are absolutely right.

253
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:09,237
She is... gorgeous.

254
00:24:12,608 --> 00:24:15,008
I think I just
screwed myself up.

255
00:24:35,298 --> 00:24:37,892
Um, uh, I'm with him.

256
00:26:10,226 --> 00:26:12,558
- Who's that with Vittorio?
- She doesn't look familiar.

257
00:26:12,662 --> 00:26:14,596
- Who can she be?
- What happened to Ursula?

258
00:26:14,697 --> 00:26:17,291
- Who is it?
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

259
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,834
- Who is it?
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

260
00:26:19,936 --> 00:26:21,836
<i>- Who is it?
- Who is it?</i>

261
00:26:21,938 --> 00:26:22,104
It's me.

262
00:26:22,104 --> 00:26:24,402
It's me.

263
00:26:24,507 --> 00:26:27,806
Wow! This place sure is
crawlin' with celebrities.

264
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,879
I'm the only person here
I never heard of.

265
00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:56,740
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

266
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,118
Ooh
Yeah, yeah

267
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:09,089
Ooh
Yeah, yeah

268
00:31:09,191 --> 00:31:11,056
Yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah

269
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,821
Yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah

270
00:31:16,298 --> 00:31:18,926
- Oh
- Oh

271
00:31:19,034 --> 00:31:20,763
- Yeah
- Yeah

272
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:22,894
- Oh, oh
- Yeah, yeah

273
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:25,200
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

274
00:31:36,452 --> 00:31:38,352
Oh
Oh

275
00:31:38,454 --> 00:31:40,479
Give me yeah
Yeah

276
00:31:40,589 --> 00:31:42,352
Oh
yeah
Oh
yeah

277
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:44,722
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

278
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:15,451
Excuse me, Signor Vitale.
There is a phone call.

279
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,727
It's Ursula.
Look how she knows me.

280
00:32:20,829 --> 00:32:23,923
No matter where I go,
she knows how to find me.

281
00:32:24,033 --> 00:32:28,800
Well, I know her too.
She'll cry and plead with me
to come to her apartment.

282
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,098
What should I do?
Be magnanimous and
forgive her...

283
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:37,110
or be aloof?

284
00:32:37,212 --> 00:32:39,112
Aloof sounds good.
You think so?

285
00:32:39,214 --> 00:32:41,205
The aloofer the better.

286
00:32:41,317 --> 00:32:44,650
I am not here.
Now I really feel great.

287
00:32:44,753 --> 00:32:47,722
I could eat a horse.
I was only kidding.

288
00:32:47,823 --> 00:32:51,122
Now we dance.
Yeah, I wasn't
hungry anyway.

289
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:29,557
Oh!
Oh, damn it.

290
00:33:47,349 --> 00:33:50,113
I'm so sorry.
Really I am.
It's all right.

291
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:52,346
It's all right.

292
00:33:52,454 --> 00:33:54,854
Where are we?
My place.
Come on.

293
00:33:56,191 --> 00:33:59,456
Your place?
Hey, wait. Just a second.

294
00:33:59,561 --> 00:34:02,860
Get in the car,
get out of the car,
go here, go there.

295
00:34:02,965 --> 00:34:06,799
You think you can just
your place and, uh, any
time you feel like it, huh?

296
00:34:06,902 --> 00:34:08,927
- Coming?
- Yeah.

297
00:34:20,249 --> 00:34:22,547
Good evening, sir.
I'm with him.

298
00:34:22,651 --> 00:34:24,551
Oh.

299
00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:29,489
Thank you.

300
00:34:31,927 --> 00:34:33,986
Were there
any calls, Manfred?
None, sir.

301
00:34:34,096 --> 00:34:36,530
No calls?
Are you sure?
None, sir.

302
00:34:36,632 --> 00:34:39,897
Positive, sir.
Well, if there are any,
I am not in.

303
00:34:40,002 --> 00:34:42,334
Yes, sir.
And bring us
a cold supper.

304
00:34:42,438 --> 00:34:44,338
Very good, sir.

305
00:35:11,733 --> 00:35:13,598
What did you say
your name was?

306
00:35:13,702 --> 00:35:16,170
Charity.
Charity Hope Valentine.

307
00:35:27,282 --> 00:35:30,547
Do you like Brahms?

308
00:35:30,652 --> 00:35:32,916
<i>Huh?
The music.</i>

309
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:37,459
Oh. Oh, yeah.

310
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:40,050
It's got a...
It's got a great beat.

311
00:35:40,162 --> 00:35:42,062
Leave it.
Well, it'll get all...

312
00:35:42,164 --> 00:35:44,064
Leave it!

313
00:35:56,111 --> 00:35:58,409
Uh, sit down.

314
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:08,146
Uh, talk to me.
Tell me what you do.

315
00:36:08,257 --> 00:36:11,624
Oh, that'd just be
a waste of time.

316
00:36:11,727 --> 00:36:14,127
Why?
'Cause I'd lie.

317
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,694
Why should you lie?

318
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:21,291
Because I really want to
make an impression on you,
and if I told you the truth,

319
00:36:21,403 --> 00:36:24,839
what I really did,
you wouldn't be impressed.

320
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,875
Let me be the judge of that.
What do you do?

321
00:36:30,913 --> 00:36:33,973
Um...
I'm a dance hall hostess.

322
00:36:36,018 --> 00:36:37,986
You what?

323
00:36:38,086 --> 00:36:41,055
- I'm a dance hall hostess.
- Oh.

324
00:36:41,156 --> 00:36:43,852
There, you see?
You should've let me lie.

325
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:46,393
I was gonna be an
assistant dental technician.

326
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,429
Well, that doesn't sound
very impressive.

327
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,589
It does to
a dance hall hostess.

328
00:36:57,272 --> 00:36:59,240
Champagne?

329
00:37:02,844 --> 00:37:05,745
Well, I don't mind
if I do.

330
00:37:05,847 --> 00:37:09,374
<i>Why did you ever
take a job like that?</i>

331
00:37:09,484 --> 00:37:13,511
I don't know.
Fickle finger
of fate, I guess.

332
00:37:13,622 --> 00:37:16,921
What?
Fickle finger of fate.

333
00:37:17,025 --> 00:37:19,687
Don't you know
what that means?
Yes, I think so.

334
00:37:19,795 --> 00:37:22,355
Well, I don't.
Not really.

335
00:37:22,464 --> 00:37:26,696
But see, these things
always seem to happen to me,
and I never know why or how.

336
00:37:26,802 --> 00:37:30,533
And people are always comin'
up to me askin', "Why did
you take up with that guy?"

337
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:32,732
Or "How come you
wound up in that joint?"

338
00:37:32,841 --> 00:37:36,743
And I always felt so dumb
sayin', "I don't know."

339
00:37:36,845 --> 00:37:39,837
But it was the truth.
I don't.

340
00:37:39,948 --> 00:37:43,975
I guess you're supposed
to know why you do things or
how come you wind up places.

341
00:37:45,954 --> 00:37:49,617
Anyway, now
whenever anybody says,
"why?" or "how?" to me,

342
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:53,661
I just say, "Fickle
finger of fate," and then
I don't feel so dumb.

343
00:37:53,762 --> 00:37:56,060
I think you just
like saying it.

344
00:37:56,164 --> 00:37:58,064
I think you're right.

345
00:37:59,201 --> 00:38:01,567
Fickle finger of fate.
There, you see?

346
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:04,138
Fickle finger of fate.

347
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:07,402
Fickle finger of fate.
Fickle finger of fate.
Fickle finger of fate.

348
00:38:07,509 --> 00:38:10,273
<i>Fickle finger of fate.
You wanna try?</i>

349
00:38:10,379 --> 00:38:12,574
Mm-mmm.
Oh, it feels good.
Really it does.

350
00:38:12,681 --> 00:38:16,082
It cools the mouth.
Oh, try it just once.
Fickle finger of fate.

351
00:38:16,184 --> 00:38:18,584
Say it.
Just once.
No, no.

352
00:38:19,988 --> 00:38:22,479
All right.

353
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:25,025
Fickle finger of fate.
That's very nice.
You like it?

354
00:38:25,127 --> 00:38:28,961
It does cool the mouth.
Oh, I got lots of phrases
I like to say.

355
00:38:29,064 --> 00:38:32,556
Like if some wisenheimer down
at the Fandango says somethin'
dirty to me sometime...

356
00:38:32,668 --> 00:38:36,035
or somethin' fresh
and I can't think
fast enough to answer,

357
00:38:36,138 --> 00:38:38,606
I like to say, "Up yours."

358
00:38:41,877 --> 00:38:43,811
You do?

359
00:38:43,912 --> 00:38:47,182
Oh, yeah, that really works.
It fits just about any situation.

360
00:38:47,182 --> 00:38:48,012
Oh, yeah, that really works.
It fits just about any situation.

361
00:38:48,116 --> 00:38:50,812
But I wouldn't say it
to anyone as refined as yourself.

362
00:38:50,919 --> 00:38:53,615
But I can say
"fickle finger of fate," can't I?

363
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:57,021
You certainly can.
You have a nice laugh.

364
00:38:59,528 --> 00:39:01,496
Ahem. You have
a nice everything.

365
00:39:02,597 --> 00:39:04,531
What shall we drink to?

366
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,931
Huh?
Oh, I know, I know.

367
00:39:07,035 --> 00:39:09,799
To the fickle finger...
Finger of fate.

368
00:39:09,905 --> 00:39:12,032
Bottoms up.
Up yours.

369
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,608
Oh! Pow!

370
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:18,146
It just slipped out.

371
00:39:18,246 --> 00:39:21,340
You're marvelous.
Really marvelous.

372
00:39:23,085 --> 00:39:25,918
I am?
Mmm.

373
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:30,788
<i>Wow. That is really somethin'
comin' from the Vittorio Vitale.</i>

374
00:39:30,892 --> 00:39:33,827
<i>What makes you think
the Vittorio Vitale
is anything special?</i>

375
00:39:33,929 --> 00:39:36,830
Are you kidding?
Haven't you ever
seen you in the movies?

376
00:39:36,932 --> 00:39:38,991
I like to think I have
better taste than that.

377
00:39:39,101 --> 00:39:41,001
You don't know
what you're missin'.

378
00:39:41,103 --> 00:39:44,630
Remember the one you did
with that Italian actress
Monica Monicalli?

379
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,106
Monica Monicelli.
Yeah.

380
00:39:47,209 --> 00:39:50,076
<i>Uh, Passion in Palermo,
I think it was called.</i>

381
00:39:50,178 --> 00:39:52,942
And there was this scene.
She was crying.

382
00:39:53,048 --> 00:39:56,984
And you bent down, and
you kissed every single one
of her fingers...

383
00:39:57,085 --> 00:39:58,985
from her pinky
to her thumb.

384
00:39:59,087 --> 00:40:01,146
You remember that?
Fortunately, no.

385
00:40:01,256 --> 00:40:03,554
Oh, I remember.
I'll never forget it.

386
00:40:05,227 --> 00:40:07,627
And then you said,

387
00:40:07,729 --> 00:40:10,892
"Without love,
life has no purpose."

388
00:40:10,999 --> 00:40:14,332
Oh, the things
I say for money.

389
00:40:14,436 --> 00:40:17,098
Did that ever hit home.

390
00:40:17,205 --> 00:40:21,801
Did you
get me where I live.

391
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:26,370
I sat through the whole film
and six marshmallow bars just
to hear that one line again.

392
00:40:26,481 --> 00:40:29,609
"Without love,
life has no purpose."

393
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,787
Is that
what you believe?

394
00:40:35,657 --> 00:40:37,557
Sure. Doesn't everybody?

395
00:40:37,659 --> 00:40:39,718
No, not everybody.

396
00:40:41,563 --> 00:40:43,463
Tell me, why do you
believe in love?

397
00:40:43,565 --> 00:40:47,331
Everybody's gotta have
some religion, don't they?
So your religion is love?

398
00:40:48,937 --> 00:40:51,838
Well, I'll tell you one thing:
I sure go to church a lot.

399
00:40:56,344 --> 00:40:58,710
You know, I see you
sitting here with
my own eyes,

400
00:40:58,814 --> 00:41:01,544
but I find it hard to believe
that you really exist.

401
00:41:07,122 --> 00:41:09,784
Yes? Uh, no,
no, thank you, Manfred.

402
00:41:09,891 --> 00:41:12,121
I'll take care of it
myself. Good night.

403
00:41:16,464 --> 00:41:18,364
Our supper.

404
00:41:36,384 --> 00:41:38,545
Caviar.

405
00:41:38,653 --> 00:41:40,553
Cold lobster.

406
00:41:41,723 --> 00:41:43,987
Brochette.

407
00:41:44,092 --> 00:41:45,992
And melon.

408
00:41:46,094 --> 00:41:48,119
May I fix you a plate?

409
00:42:02,043 --> 00:42:03,943
What's the matter?

410
00:42:04,045 --> 00:42:06,570
They'll never believe it.

411
00:42:06,681 --> 00:42:11,015
Believe what?
That I'm here, in
Vittorio Vitale's bedroom...

412
00:42:12,387 --> 00:42:16,050
drinkin' champagne and
he's servin' me dinner.

413
00:42:16,157 --> 00:42:18,352
Who won't believe it?
My girlfriends.

414
00:42:20,462 --> 00:42:22,862
What can we do
about it?

415
00:42:26,234 --> 00:42:29,328
Do you think...
What?

416
00:42:29,437 --> 00:42:31,735
That...
Yes?

417
00:42:33,742 --> 00:42:36,836
Could I have a personally
autographed picture?

418
00:42:39,948 --> 00:42:43,384
You can have me
in profile or full face,

419
00:42:43,485 --> 00:42:45,851
with moustache, clean-shaven,

420
00:42:45,954 --> 00:42:47,888
smiling or sexy.

421
00:42:47,989 --> 00:42:52,119
Oh, I will take that
clean-shaven, full-faced
and sexy one.

422
00:42:54,095 --> 00:42:56,029
For...
Charity.

423
00:42:56,131 --> 00:42:58,065
For Charity.
Um...

424
00:42:58,166 --> 00:43:01,602
Who was
with me tonight...

425
00:43:01,703 --> 00:43:03,603
in my apartment.

426
00:43:05,507 --> 00:43:08,908
Alone.
Alone.

427
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:11,069
I swear it.

428
00:43:11,179 --> 00:43:13,670
Vittorio Vit...
Yes, yes,
I know the rest.

429
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,851
<i>Eccola.</i>

430
00:43:20,956 --> 00:43:23,356
Wow. You even
write great.

431
00:43:25,327 --> 00:43:27,227
Oh, what a night for me.

432
00:43:29,497 --> 00:43:31,988
Tomorrow, you're movin'
right into my locker,

433
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,500
and every time
I open the door, pow!

434
00:43:35,837 --> 00:43:38,305
Oh, they're...
They're not gonna
believe this.

435
00:43:38,406 --> 00:43:40,738
They're gonna think
this is a forgery.

436
00:43:44,379 --> 00:43:47,473
Where you goin'?
You wait for me.

437
00:43:47,582 --> 00:43:49,846
I'll be right back.

438
00:43:49,951 --> 00:43:51,851
Now don't go away.

439
00:43:51,953 --> 00:43:54,478
Hurricane Hazel could strike.
I'm not movin'.

440
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:42,226
If they

441
00:44:42,337 --> 00:44:44,897
Could see me now

442
00:44:45,006 --> 00:44:47,133
That little gang of mine

443
00:44:47,242 --> 00:44:50,905
I'm eatin' fancy chow
and drinkin' fancy wine

444
00:44:51,012 --> 00:44:54,971
I'd like those stumble bums
to see for a fact

445
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:58,917
The kind of top drawer
first-rate chums I attract

446
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:02,922
All I can say is wowee
look at where I am

447
00:45:03,024 --> 00:45:07,188
Tonight I landed... pow
right in a pot of jam

448
00:45:07,295 --> 00:45:09,957
What a setup, holy cow

449
00:45:10,065 --> 00:45:13,432
They'd never believe it
if my friends could see me

450
00:45:13,535 --> 00:45:15,435
Now

451
00:45:29,784 --> 00:45:31,684
They'd never believe it

452
00:45:33,955 --> 00:45:37,254
They'd never believe it
They'd never believe it

453
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:39,292
They'd never believe it

454
00:45:39,394 --> 00:45:42,056
They'd never believe it

455
00:45:42,163 --> 00:45:43,465
They'd never believe it
They'd never believe it

456
00:45:43,465 --> 00:45:45,990
They'd never believe it
They'd never believe it

457
00:45:46,101 --> 00:45:48,001
They'd never believe it

458
00:45:48,103 --> 00:45:51,129
Ooh.

459
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:54,299
Do you think this will do?
I used it in my first film.

460
00:45:55,677 --> 00:45:58,305
Oh! Ohh!

461
00:45:58,413 --> 00:46:00,313
What a beautiful...

462
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:03,317
black thing.

463
00:46:03,418 --> 00:46:05,443
It's a hat.

464
00:46:05,553 --> 00:46:07,487
<i>Eccola.</i>

465
00:46:07,589 --> 00:46:09,489
You see?
My initials.

466
00:46:11,292 --> 00:46:13,419
It is yours.

467
00:46:13,528 --> 00:46:15,428
Now wait.
There is more.

468
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,881
If they could

469
00:47:08,983 --> 00:47:12,885
See me now
my little dusty group

470
00:47:12,987 --> 00:47:16,218
Traipsin' round this
million-dollar chicken coop

471
00:47:16,324 --> 00:47:20,090
I'd hear those
thrift shop cats say
Brother, get her

472
00:47:20,195 --> 00:47:24,325
Draped on a bedspread made
from three kinds of fur

473
00:47:24,432 --> 00:47:26,559
All I can say is wow

474
00:47:26,668 --> 00:47:28,568
Wait 'til the riff and raff

475
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:32,629
See just exactly how
he signed his autograph

476
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,538
What a buildup, holy cow

477
00:47:35,643 --> 00:47:38,669
They'd never believe it
If my friends could see me

478
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,805
Now

479
00:47:58,132 --> 00:48:00,191
Hi.

480
00:48:00,301 --> 00:48:03,099
<i>Ciao.
Boy, this is some
terrific mattress.</i>

481
00:48:06,307 --> 00:48:09,640
My initials.
This, also, is for you.

482
00:48:09,744 --> 00:48:11,644
Oh, I couldn't.
You must.

483
00:48:11,746 --> 00:48:13,646
Oh, really, I can't.
I insist.

484
00:48:13,748 --> 00:48:16,717
I'll take it.
I'll go see if
there is anything else.

485
00:48:21,689 --> 00:48:23,919
Chow, Vittorio, baby.

486
00:48:27,061 --> 00:48:31,191
If they could see me now
alone with Mr. V

487
00:48:31,299 --> 00:48:34,427
Who's waitin' on me
like he was a maitre d'

488
00:48:34,535 --> 00:48:38,301
I hear my buddies sayin'
Crazy, what gives

489
00:48:38,406 --> 00:48:42,206
Tonight she's livin' like
the other half lives

490
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:46,178
To think the highest brow
which I must say is he

491
00:48:46,281 --> 00:48:50,183
Should pick the lowest brow
which there's no doubt is me

492
00:48:50,285 --> 00:48:53,015
What a step up, holy cow

493
00:48:53,121 --> 00:48:56,181
They'd never believe it
If my friends

494
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:58,191
Could

495
00:48:59,294 --> 00:49:01,194
See me

496
00:49:02,196 --> 00:49:04,096
Now

497
00:50:04,258 --> 00:50:06,158
They'd never believe it

498
00:50:08,563 --> 00:50:11,327
They'd never believe it
If my friends

499
00:50:11,432 --> 00:50:14,265
Could see me

500
00:50:15,937 --> 00:50:18,906
Hey, girls. Look! It's me!

501
00:50:19,006 --> 00:50:20,906
Charity!

502
00:50:38,459 --> 00:50:42,589
Oh. Oh, boy, you know this...
This is some terrific floor.

503
00:50:50,471 --> 00:50:54,134
Miss Charity Hope Valentine.

504
00:50:54,242 --> 00:50:58,269
Since I could find
nothing else in all
of my possessions...

505
00:50:58,379 --> 00:51:01,974
that could truly express
my warm feelings for you,

506
00:51:02,083 --> 00:51:03,983
for what you
have done tonight,

507
00:51:05,286 --> 00:51:08,016
for what you
have given me,

508
00:51:08,122 --> 00:51:11,114
I ask you please
to accept this.

509
00:51:17,932 --> 00:51:20,696
Oh, wow. I accept.

510
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:26,736
And may I just say that
I never received such a gift...

511
00:51:26,841 --> 00:51:29,173
in such a gorgeous package.

512
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:35,046
Mr. Vitale, you've been
so terrific to me.

513
00:51:36,317 --> 00:51:38,842
I think that this is...
This is the best time...

514
00:51:38,953 --> 00:51:41,251
I ever spent
in my whole life.

515
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:45,617
No, no, no, please.

516
00:51:50,965 --> 00:51:53,763
Suppose you eat
your supper, huh?

517
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:57,695
<i>Pronto.</i>

518
00:51:57,805 --> 00:52:00,968
Well, tell her I'm asleep.
No, tell her I'm dead.

519
00:52:01,075 --> 00:52:03,100
Well, tell her th...

520
00:52:03,211 --> 00:52:05,839
What?

521
00:52:07,982 --> 00:52:09,882
Lock the door.
Lock the door.

522
00:52:11,252 --> 00:52:13,618
It's Ursula. She's here.

523
00:52:15,122 --> 00:52:18,319
What should I do?
What should I do?

524
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:23,494
If you want my opinion,
we don't really need her.

525
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:26,032
And in my opinion, we
don't really need her.

526
00:52:28,135 --> 00:52:31,832
Vittorio! Vittorio,
I know you're in there.
Let me in.

527
00:52:31,939 --> 00:52:34,134
Oh, Ursula, go away.

528
00:52:34,242 --> 00:52:37,268
- Vittorio, please.
- No.

529
00:52:37,378 --> 00:52:39,869
- Please?
- No!

530
00:52:39,981 --> 00:52:43,678
- Please!
- Oh, I can't stand it. Let her in.

531
00:52:43,784 --> 00:52:45,684
Yes, you're right.

532
00:52:52,693 --> 00:52:55,389
In here.

533
00:52:55,496 --> 00:52:57,555
I'll get rid of her
as soon as I can.
Oh, but...

534
00:52:57,665 --> 00:52:59,565
<i>
In a second.</i>

535
00:52:59,667 --> 00:53:02,795
Vittorio, let me in.
Don't treat me this way.

536
00:53:02,904 --> 00:53:06,806
I almost forgot.
Oh, thank you.

537
00:53:06,908 --> 00:53:09,138
Thank you.
Here.

538
00:53:09,243 --> 00:53:12,337
Oh. If you get a chance,
I'd love a cold beer.

539
00:53:12,446 --> 00:53:15,074
Yeah.

540
00:53:15,182 --> 00:53:18,618
<i>Vittorio, I'm not leaving
until you open this door.</i>

541
00:53:24,091 --> 00:53:28,551
Oh, Vittorio,
what took you so long?
What's going on in here?

542
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:32,497
Oh! Is that why you came back?
To accuse me again, huh?

543
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,398
You have someone else
in here.
Oh, very well.

544
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:39,064
I picked up a girl
off the street, and, uh,
she's hiding in the closet.

545
00:53:39,173 --> 00:53:41,607
<i>- I don't believe you.
- Well, look for yourself.</i>

546
00:53:41,709 --> 00:53:45,110
<i>All right, I will.</i>

547
00:53:49,016 --> 00:53:51,246
Oh, what's
the matter with me?

548
00:53:51,352 --> 00:53:55,584
<i>You wouldn't stoop so low
as to hide another woman
in the closet.</i>

549
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,454
<i>Oh, I don't know
what comes over me.</i>

550
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,586
<i>The thought of you
with another woman
just drives me insane.</i>

551
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:05,222
<i>Why do I torture myself
this way?</i>

552
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:07,733
Why? Why?

553
00:54:07,835 --> 00:54:09,735
Why?

554
00:54:11,105 --> 00:54:14,836
<i>If I knew you really cared,
I'd give you anything.</i>

555
00:54:16,243 --> 00:54:18,711
<i>I care, cara mia.</i>

556
00:54:18,813 --> 00:54:21,247
Of course I care.

557
00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:23,317
But why can't we discuss
this in the morning?

558
00:54:24,685 --> 00:54:27,245
<i>Do you care, Vittorio?
Do you really care?</i>

559
00:54:27,355 --> 00:54:29,983
Of course I care.

560
00:54:30,091 --> 00:54:31,991
Of course I care.

561
00:54:32,093 --> 00:54:34,857
<i>Really?
Really.</i>

562
00:54:34,962 --> 00:54:37,897
You know, Ursula,
I don't understand...

563
00:54:37,999 --> 00:54:40,365
why we torture
each other this way.

564
00:54:40,468 --> 00:54:43,460
Oh, because I'm a fool,
jealous fool.

565
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:46,734
<i>Oh, how could I have been
so foolish as to believe
you'd bring home...</i>

566
00:54:46,841 --> 00:54:48,968
<i>some cheap little nothing?</i>

567
00:54:52,213 --> 00:54:54,579
<i>Now, Ursula, I really
do think you should go.</i>

568
00:54:54,682 --> 00:54:57,378
<i>It's so late, and
I'm really very tired.</i>

569
00:54:57,485 --> 00:54:59,976
<i>We can talk again
tomorrow, all right?</i>

570
00:55:18,906 --> 00:55:20,840
<i>Oh. Just a moment.</i>

571
00:55:35,289 --> 00:55:38,156
Without you,
there is no love.

572
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,722
And without love,

573
00:55:45,666 --> 00:55:48,032
<i>Life has no purpose.</i>

574
00:56:04,618 --> 00:56:07,143
Oh, Ursula, Ursula.

575
00:56:07,254 --> 00:56:09,916
Mmm, Vittorio,
Vittorio.

576
00:56:11,792 --> 00:56:13,987
Wow.

577
00:56:14,095 --> 00:56:16,290
Oh, talk about
your foreign movie.

578
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:24,795
If my friends

579
00:56:26,373 --> 00:56:28,273
Could

580
00:56:30,244 --> 00:56:32,144
See me

581
00:56:33,614 --> 00:56:35,514
Now

582
00:57:03,477 --> 00:57:05,377
Shh-shh.

583
00:57:05,479 --> 00:57:07,674
It's morning.
Oh.

584
00:57:07,782 --> 00:57:10,649
Good morning.
Good morning.

585
00:57:10,751 --> 00:57:14,312
Are you all right?
Well, it's
too soon to tell.

586
00:57:14,421 --> 00:57:16,855
Uh.
Okay.

587
00:57:36,443 --> 00:57:38,934
Wow.

588
00:57:42,516 --> 00:57:45,974
Silk sheets!
Must have cost a fortune.

589
00:58:00,067 --> 00:58:04,527
Thank you very much
for everything. I am sorry
the way things turned out.

590
00:58:04,638 --> 00:58:07,937
No, it sorta figured,
you know?
Why do you say that?

591
00:58:08,042 --> 00:58:10,010
Because you're you,
and I'm me.

592
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:19,847
For the taxi.
No, you've given me
enough already, really.

593
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:28,160
Well.

594
00:58:40,608 --> 00:58:43,441
<i>- Chow.
- Ciao.</i>

595
00:58:50,484 --> 00:58:54,716
<i>Well, first we go
to this ritzy place, where we
end up dancin' together.</i>

596
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:57,290
<i>Oh, he is some
terrific dancer.</i>

597
00:58:57,391 --> 00:59:00,189
<i>Then, we go back to his
fashionable east-side apartment,</i>

598
00:59:00,294 --> 00:59:02,387
<i>except it was
a whole, entire house...</i>

599
00:59:02,496 --> 00:59:05,761
<i>with so many rooms
you needed a compass
to find your way around.</i>

600
00:59:05,866 --> 00:59:08,391
<i>Then we just sort of
sat around sippin' champagne...</i>

601
00:59:08,502 --> 00:59:11,096
<i>and talkin' about life
and things, you know.</i>

602
00:59:11,205 --> 00:59:13,765
<i>Oh, boy. It was
some terrific night.</i>

603
00:59:17,177 --> 00:59:20,977
<i>So, come 6:00 in the morning,
guess what he wants to do then?</i>

604
00:59:21,081 --> 00:59:23,641
<i>Send me home in his own
personal, private limousine.</i>

605
00:59:23,751 --> 00:59:28,211
<i>I say to him, "Vittorio, honey,
forget it. I enjoy walkin'
when the sun's comin' up. "</i>

606
00:59:28,322 --> 00:59:33,282
But to tell you the truth,
I didn't actually walk.
I mean I flew all the way home.

607
00:59:33,394 --> 00:59:35,419
My feet never once
touched the ground.

608
00:59:35,529 --> 00:59:38,327
Well, you keep on
smokin' them funny
little cigarettes,

609
00:59:38,432 --> 00:59:40,332
you're bound to do
a little flyin'.

610
00:59:40,434 --> 00:59:44,564
I knew you wouldn't believe
I spent the entire evening
with Vittorio Vitale.

611
00:59:44,672 --> 00:59:46,572
You swear?
I swear.

612
00:59:46,674 --> 00:59:48,574
On your mother's life?
On my mother's life.

613
00:59:48,676 --> 00:59:52,271
Hey, Wanda, call up
and see how her mother is.
All right, look.

614
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:57,146
Look... what he gave me.
And look what else.

615
00:59:58,585 --> 01:00:00,883
His cane.
And his hat.

616
01:00:00,988 --> 01:00:04,082
Mementos of our
evening together.

617
01:00:04,758 --> 01:00:08,660
Oh! Oh! Oh!
His hat!

618
01:00:08,762 --> 01:00:10,696
Is that all
he gave you?

619
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:13,062
What do you mean
is that all?

620
01:00:13,167 --> 01:00:15,795
Hi, team.
Hey, Nickie, did you
hear about Charity...

621
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:18,394
<i>spendin' the night
with Vittorio Vitale?</i>

622
01:00:18,505 --> 01:00:20,735
I don't believe it!

623
01:00:20,841 --> 01:00:24,675
And all she got for it
was an old hat and a cane.
I believe it.

624
01:00:24,778 --> 01:00:27,576
Oh, honey, if I was you,
I'd pass this hat...

625
01:00:27,681 --> 01:00:31,742
and beat myself to death
with the cane,
'cause you are dumb.

626
01:00:31,852 --> 01:00:34,412
You don't even know
what happened.
Forget it, baby.

627
01:00:34,521 --> 01:00:38,218
What you do in bed
is your business.
You see?
I wasn't even in bed.

628
01:00:38,325 --> 01:00:40,418
I was in the closet.

629
01:00:45,165 --> 01:00:46,792
To each his own.

630
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,528
The least you could have got
was a mink coat!

631
01:00:49,636 --> 01:00:51,763
Oh, what's he gonna give me
a mink coat for?

632
01:00:51,872 --> 01:00:54,932
If you gonna mess with
the details, you ain't
gonna get no results.

633
01:00:55,042 --> 01:00:59,035
A hat and a cane? If it was
me, I'd have walked out of there
with my own beauty parlor.

634
01:00:59,146 --> 01:01:01,046
Now you'll never
get outta here.

635
01:01:01,148 --> 01:01:03,050
It was your big chance,
baby, and you blew it.

636
01:01:03,217 --> 01:01:05,481
Now you're stuck...
stuck like the rest of us.

637
01:01:05,586 --> 01:01:10,853
And it ain't no use flappin'
your wings, 'cause we are caught
in the flypaper of life.

638
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:16,154
Not me.
What'd you say?

639
01:01:17,264 --> 01:01:19,164
I said not me.

640
01:01:19,266 --> 01:01:23,532
What chance have we got
in a miserable joint like this?

641
01:01:23,637 --> 01:01:25,867
I mean, just look at us.

642
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:28,737
Don't look at me.
I was always like this.

643
01:01:28,842 --> 01:01:30,833
What's the matter
with her?
Nothin'.

644
01:01:30,944 --> 01:01:34,277
If you happen to like
a lot of beat-up broads
nobody cares about.

645
01:01:34,381 --> 01:01:36,281
Well, not me.

646
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:41,286
I'm not gonna spend
the next 40 years of my life
in the Fandango Ballroom.

647
01:01:41,388 --> 01:01:46,655
I am not gonna become
the world's first little old
gray-haired taxi dancer.

648
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:49,160
I am getting out.

649
01:01:49,263 --> 01:01:52,255
Out!
What a nice word.

650
01:01:54,701 --> 01:01:57,829
There's gotta be something
better than this

651
01:01:57,938 --> 01:02:01,135
There's gotta be something
better to do

652
01:02:01,241 --> 01:02:04,574
And when I find me
something better to do

653
01:02:04,678 --> 01:02:06,578
I'm gonna get up
I'm gonna get out

654
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:09,740
I'm gonna get up, get out
and do it

655
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:12,944
There's gotta be some
respectable trade

656
01:02:13,053 --> 01:02:16,216
There's gotta be something
easy to learn

657
01:02:16,323 --> 01:02:19,918
And when I find me something
a half-wit can learn

658
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:21,927
I'm gonna get up
I'm gonna get out

659
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:24,224
I'm gonna get up, get out
and learn it

660
01:02:24,331 --> 01:02:27,425
<i>All these jokers
how I hate them</i>

661
01:02:27,534 --> 01:02:29,695
With their groping
Grabbing

662
01:02:29,803 --> 01:02:31,703
Clutching
Clinching

663
01:02:31,805 --> 01:02:33,705
Strangling
Handling

664
01:02:33,807 --> 01:02:35,832
Fumbling, pinching
Pinching

665
01:02:35,943 --> 01:02:37,843
Phooey!

666
01:02:37,945 --> 01:02:40,846
There's gotta be some life
cleaner than this

667
01:02:40,948 --> 01:02:44,247
There's gotta be
some good reason to live

668
01:02:44,351 --> 01:02:48,048
And when I find me
some kind of life I can live

669
01:02:48,155 --> 01:02:50,055
I'm gonna get up
I'm gonna get out

670
01:02:50,157 --> 01:02:52,352
I'm gonna get up, get out
and live it

671
01:02:54,027 --> 01:02:56,393
I got it.
I have got it!
What?

672
01:02:56,497 --> 01:02:58,590
I'm gonna be
a receptionist.

673
01:02:58,699 --> 01:03:01,793
In one of those glass
skyscrapers, 9:00 to 5:00.

674
01:03:01,902 --> 01:03:05,201
My own typewriter.
And water coolers. And office parties.

675
01:03:05,305 --> 01:03:08,763
Ooh-ooh-ooh
and coffee breaks.

676
01:03:08,876 --> 01:03:11,470
Wow!

677
01:03:11,578 --> 01:03:14,877
When I sit at my desk
on the 41st floor

678
01:03:14,982 --> 01:03:18,577
In my copy of a copy of
a copy of Dior

679
01:03:18,685 --> 01:03:21,882
I'll receive big tycoons
and I'll point to a chair

680
01:03:21,989 --> 01:03:25,288
I'll say
Honey, while you're waiting

681
01:03:25,392 --> 01:03:29,658
How would ya like
to put it down over there

682
01:03:33,433 --> 01:03:36,231
There's gotta be something
better than this

683
01:03:36,336 --> 01:03:39,396
There's gotta be something
better to do

684
01:03:39,506 --> 01:03:42,566
And when I find me
something better to do

685
01:03:42,676 --> 01:03:44,576
I'm gonna get up
I'm gonna get out

686
01:03:44,678 --> 01:03:46,646
I'm gonna get up, get out
and do it

687
01:03:49,416 --> 01:03:51,907
Hey, hey, me too, me too.

688
01:03:52,019 --> 01:03:54,817
I'm gonna get out of here, and
I'm gonna go right to the top.

689
01:03:54,922 --> 01:03:56,981
Yea!
I am gonna be...

690
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:59,217
a hat check girl...

691
01:03:59,326 --> 01:04:02,523
at one of them east-side
high-class restaurants.

692
01:04:02,629 --> 01:04:06,326
You know, a tray
full of cigarettes costin'
60c a pack and keep the change?

693
01:04:06,433 --> 01:04:08,367
And all those hats
comin' in:

694
01:04:08,468 --> 01:04:10,936
Derbies, homburgs.

695
01:04:11,038 --> 01:04:13,472
Ooh, and that cute
little checkered number...

696
01:04:13,574 --> 01:04:17,271
with the skinny brim
and the feather!

697
01:04:19,379 --> 01:04:21,438
Check your hat, sir
Check your coat, sir

698
01:04:21,548 --> 01:04:23,778
Check your vest, sir
Check your pants

699
01:04:23,884 --> 01:04:25,852
Check your socks, sir
Check your shoes, sir

700
01:04:25,953 --> 01:04:28,183
I can hold them
while you dance

701
01:04:28,288 --> 01:04:30,313
Check your eyes, sir
Check your ears, sir

702
01:04:30,424 --> 01:04:32,483
Check and see if
you are free

703
01:04:32,593 --> 01:04:34,618
How about it
after hours

704
01:04:34,728 --> 01:04:37,959
I'll check you

705
01:04:38,065 --> 01:04:40,795
And you check me

706
01:04:48,075 --> 01:04:50,441
Me too, me too.
I'm gonna get out too.

707
01:04:50,544 --> 01:04:52,739
<i>But, baby,
what can you do?
I don't know.</i>

708
01:04:52,846 --> 01:04:56,247
Just get me out of here,
and I'll figure it out later.

709
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:59,547
There's gotta be some life
cleaner than this

710
01:04:59,653 --> 01:05:03,453
There's gotta be some good
reason to live

711
01:05:03,557 --> 01:05:06,617
And when I find it

712
01:05:06,727 --> 01:05:12,063
Some kind of life
I can live

713
01:05:12,165 --> 01:05:14,065
I'm gonna get up
I'm gonna get out

714
01:05:14,167 --> 01:05:17,000
I'm gonna get up, get out
and live it

715
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:40,149
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!

716
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,194
Ha!

717
01:05:42,296 --> 01:05:43,820
Phooey.

718
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:45,158
Phooey.

719
01:05:45,265 --> 01:05:47,563
Yip.

720
01:06:27,774 --> 01:06:31,073
La-la la-la
la-la la-la

721
01:06:31,178 --> 01:06:33,578
La-la la

722
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:34,578
La

723
01:06:34,681 --> 01:06:37,775
La-la la-la
la-la la-la

724
01:06:37,884 --> 01:06:40,978
La-la la la-la-la
la-la-la la-la-la

725
01:07:09,116 --> 01:07:12,779
And when I find me
some kind of life I can live

726
01:07:12,886 --> 01:07:14,786
I'm gonna get up

727
01:07:16,256 --> 01:07:18,156
I'm gonna get out

728
01:07:19,693 --> 01:07:21,593
I'm gonna get up, get out

729
01:07:22,696 --> 01:07:27,531
And live

730
01:07:34,174 --> 01:07:36,074
Live it

731
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:41,613
<i>Excuse me, ladies.</i>

732
01:07:41,715 --> 01:07:44,377
They have just announced the winners
of the Irish Sweepstakes,

733
01:07:44,484 --> 01:07:48,818
and since none of you lovely
creatures is among the winners,
get your keesters back inside.

734
01:07:48,922 --> 01:07:51,755
Hey, Herman,
in the first place,
watch your language.

735
01:07:51,858 --> 01:07:56,022
There's ladies present.
And in the second place, we're
not so sure we're comin' back.

736
01:07:56,129 --> 01:07:58,893
I can always find
somebody else.
That's the third place.

737
01:07:58,999 --> 01:08:03,493
I'm comin', Herman.
But, Nickie, what about all
those plans we just made?

738
01:08:03,603 --> 01:08:06,197
Yeah.
What about 'em?

739
01:09:23,817 --> 01:09:27,014
Oh, I've got it, Mr. Carmichael.
Uh, stenotypist...

740
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,953
with a guarantee
of nine paid holidays,

741
01:09:30,056 --> 01:09:32,524
cost of living escalation...

742
01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:35,595
and free maternity care.

743
01:09:35,695 --> 01:09:39,597
Okay, Mr. Carmichael,
first stenotypist that
walks in, you've got her.

744
01:09:41,034 --> 01:09:43,468
Good-bye, Mr. Carmichael.

745
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:49,966
- Ahem.
- Come in. Sit down.

746
01:09:57,450 --> 01:09:59,350
Card.

747
01:10:03,356 --> 01:10:07,520
Well, now, Miss, uh, Valentine,
what can we do for you?

748
01:10:07,627 --> 01:10:09,891
I want a job...
a nice job.

749
01:10:09,996 --> 01:10:12,931
<i>Of course you do.
What nice job would you like?</i>

750
01:10:13,033 --> 01:10:16,002
And don't say mine,
'cause it's already taken.

751
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:22,471
Well, something
in an office.
Good.

752
01:10:22,576 --> 01:10:24,908
You, uh, type,
of course?
No.

753
01:10:25,011 --> 01:10:27,445
Take shorthand?
No.

754
01:10:27,547 --> 01:10:30,380
Operate calculators?
Nope.

755
01:10:30,483 --> 01:10:32,576
Keep books?
No.

756
01:10:32,686 --> 01:10:34,586
File?
No.

757
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:37,623
Run a switchboard?
No.

758
01:10:37,724 --> 01:10:40,124
You speak
a foreign language?
No.

759
01:10:40,226 --> 01:10:43,059
Um...
No.

760
01:10:45,765 --> 01:10:48,165
Ask me some more
questions.

761
01:10:48,268 --> 01:10:51,362
Well, look,
Miss, uh, Valentine...

762
01:10:51,471 --> 01:10:57,034
How about, uh,
stenotypist?

763
01:10:57,143 --> 01:10:59,805
<i>Oh. Are you
a stenotypist?</i>

764
01:11:01,615 --> 01:11:05,176
<i>Well, not at the moment.
But you do
stenotype?</i>

765
01:11:06,853 --> 01:11:09,754
- Maybe.
- Uh-huh. What do you mean?

766
01:11:11,992 --> 01:11:14,324
What is it?

767
01:11:16,429 --> 01:11:20,263
Um, where did you
go to school?

768
01:11:20,367 --> 01:11:24,303
Uh, public
elementary school #84.

769
01:11:24,404 --> 01:11:26,964
I mean after that.
After what?

770
01:11:29,542 --> 01:11:31,567
This isn't goin'
too good, is it?

771
01:11:33,213 --> 01:11:36,046
Have you ever had
any formal training...

772
01:11:36,149 --> 01:11:39,084
in any field whatsoever?

773
01:11:41,121 --> 01:11:44,090
Well, nothing
that comes to mind.

774
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:47,250
Well, then, what do you
expect me to do?

775
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,294
I told you,
find me a nice job.

776
01:11:49,396 --> 01:11:51,728
<i>But you can't do anything.</i>

777
01:11:51,831 --> 01:11:55,289
B-But I must be able
to do somethin'.

778
01:11:55,402 --> 01:11:58,303
Well, I mean, everybody
knows how to do somethin'.

779
01:11:59,539 --> 01:12:01,439
Don't they?

780
01:12:01,541 --> 01:12:04,066
I used to think so.
Look, miss, uh...

781
01:12:04,177 --> 01:12:09,479
Valentine. Oh, please,
Mr. Nicholsby, you gotta
find me somethin'.

782
01:12:09,582 --> 01:12:12,574
I don't wanna go back
to that place where
I'm workin', you know?

783
01:12:12,686 --> 01:12:16,213
I mean, I want a nice job where
I can meet some nice people.

784
01:12:16,322 --> 01:12:19,723
I w... I want very much
to change my life.

785
01:12:19,826 --> 01:12:23,387
I'll work hard.
I'll work awful hard.
And I'll learn quick.

786
01:12:23,496 --> 01:12:26,294
Find me somethin',
Mr. Nicholsby, please.

787
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:29,960
Ohh, is this a gag?

788
01:12:31,671 --> 01:12:34,231
- Huh?
- I'm right, aren't I?

789
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:38,333
<i>It is a gag.
Those guys down the hall
put you up to it.</i>

790
01:12:38,445 --> 01:12:42,313
Like the time they sent over
a guy that stuttered for
a radio announcer's job.

791
01:12:42,415 --> 01:12:46,715
They should know by now
I can spot 'em.

792
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:50,312
You can tell them
you really had me going.

793
01:12:54,394 --> 01:12:57,056
But it took you a while,
didn't it?

794
01:12:58,531 --> 01:13:01,762
Well, you're a very good
sp-sport, Mr. Nicholsby.

795
01:13:01,868 --> 01:13:04,428
Listen, you're
pretty good yourself.

796
01:13:06,873 --> 01:13:08,773
Well, I gotta be goin' now.

797
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:14,411
I have a job, you know.
I got a swell job.

798
01:13:16,416 --> 01:13:18,748
I was just
helpin' 'em out.

799
01:13:18,852 --> 01:13:23,721
That stuff about "public
elementary school #84"...
That was perfect.

800
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:27,059
Yeah, it was good.

801
01:13:51,451 --> 01:13:53,885
Miss? Are you
going down, miss?

802
01:13:55,789 --> 01:13:58,485
Miss, I'm afraid I'm
going to be awfully late.

803
01:14:02,495 --> 01:14:04,725
I didn't mean
to rush you.
I hope I wasn't rude,

804
01:14:04,831 --> 01:14:08,995
but I have an appointment,
and if I'm late, they'll
blow a fuse.

805
01:14:12,772 --> 01:14:15,297
- What was that?
- We stopped.

806
01:14:15,408 --> 01:14:18,138
Why did I have to say that?

807
01:14:18,244 --> 01:14:21,270
About blowing out a fuse.
What a dumb thing to say.

808
01:14:21,381 --> 01:14:24,316
Press the button over there.
We'll get started again.

809
01:14:30,356 --> 01:14:32,916
<i>We're stuck.
Yeah.</i>

810
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:39,530
Oh, boy.

811
01:14:45,104 --> 01:14:47,538
Kind of st...
Kind of stuffy in here.

812
01:14:50,076 --> 01:14:51,976
Isn't it
kind of stuffy?

813
01:15:03,156 --> 01:15:06,853
Maximum weight in pounds:
3,500. What do you weigh?

814
01:15:08,194 --> 01:15:10,355
128.
Yeah, we're all right.

815
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:12,931
Course we're all right.
Yeah, we're fine.
We're fine.

816
01:15:15,635 --> 01:15:18,729
Yeah.

817
01:15:18,838 --> 01:15:22,399
We're just stuck in the...
the little old elevator.

818
01:15:27,247 --> 01:15:30,307
Hey, are you
okay really?
Who, me?

819
01:15:30,416 --> 01:15:33,249
Yeah.
Oh, yes, I'm fine.

820
01:15:33,353 --> 01:15:37,050
I'm fine. L-I have to
get used to it, that's all,
'cause this is the first time...

821
01:15:37,156 --> 01:15:39,556
I've ever been trapped
in an elevator.

822
01:15:40,793 --> 01:15:42,761
Trapped, trapped, trapped.

823
01:15:46,799 --> 01:15:49,063
Hey.

824
01:15:49,168 --> 01:15:53,195
Hey, do you have that thing,
you know, where you're scared
of small, tight places?

825
01:15:53,306 --> 01:15:55,206
Claustrophobia?
No, no, no.
Yeah.

826
01:15:55,308 --> 01:15:57,742
Nothing like that.

827
01:15:57,844 --> 01:16:00,608
Claustrophobia?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

828
01:16:00,713 --> 01:16:03,546
No, l-I just,
uh, can't stand...

829
01:16:03,650 --> 01:16:06,551
small, tight places.

830
01:16:06,653 --> 01:16:11,056
But I can handle this all right,
because I know we'll get out
of here in a couple of minutes.

831
01:16:11,157 --> 01:16:13,318
- Well, sure, we will.
- You really think so?

832
01:16:13,426 --> 01:16:17,226
- Of course I think so.
- If you thought we're really
trapped, what would you say?

833
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:19,628
But we're not
really trapped.

834
01:16:19,732 --> 01:16:23,293
Yeah, I know, but if you thought
we were, what would you say?

835
01:16:23,403 --> 01:16:25,394
Then I'd say,
"We're really trapped."

836
01:16:25,505 --> 01:16:27,598
My God! I knew it!
I knew it!

837
01:16:27,707 --> 01:16:29,937
Dear, you shouldn't
get so excited.

838
01:16:31,311 --> 01:16:35,441
Yeah. Look.
Isn't this awful?

839
01:16:35,548 --> 01:16:40,747
'Cause I never act this way, really.
I'm a very calm, organized person.

840
01:16:40,853 --> 01:16:45,222
I want you to know that
if-if-if-if it really
comes down to it,

841
01:16:45,325 --> 01:16:47,316
you can depend on me.

842
01:16:47,427 --> 01:16:49,827
You understand that?
Yeah, I understand.

843
01:16:49,929 --> 01:16:52,864
Yeah. I just hope
it doesn't come down to it.

844
01:16:55,168 --> 01:16:57,568
<i>Maybe I should
yell for help.
Why not?</i>

845
01:17:01,107 --> 01:17:03,007
Help.

846
01:17:06,212 --> 01:17:08,112
Help.

847
01:17:09,248 --> 01:17:11,148
Help!

848
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:14,583
Oh! Here. My name is
Charity Hope Valentine, and...

849
01:17:14,687 --> 01:17:18,123
Hey, you're shaking!
All over.

850
01:17:18,224 --> 01:17:20,192
Let me rub your wrist.

851
01:17:20,293 --> 01:17:24,491
You know what I feel like
doing now? I mean, you
know what my impulse is?

852
01:17:24,597 --> 01:17:26,690
To take off
all my clothes.

853
01:17:29,602 --> 01:17:31,900
I don't think that
would do very much good.

854
01:17:32,005 --> 01:17:35,031
You'd think they'd have
a telephone in here,
wouldn't you? Never again.

855
01:17:35,141 --> 01:17:39,601
Never go in an elevator again
without checking for a phone!
Always check for a phone!

856
01:17:43,516 --> 01:17:46,144
Hey.
Listen, I have an idea.

857
01:17:46,252 --> 01:17:49,483
What do you think of this?
Climbing out the top of the elevator,

858
01:17:49,589 --> 01:17:54,822
shimmying up the cable
and then forcing the door open
on the floor above.

859
01:17:54,927 --> 01:17:58,385
Well, it might work,
but I do think it sounds
a little dangerous.

860
01:17:58,498 --> 01:18:01,092
Then don't try it.
Stay here with me.

861
01:18:02,635 --> 01:18:05,798
Hey, come on down there!
We don't think it's funny
anymore!

862
01:18:08,408 --> 01:18:11,605
If I could just get out
for a few minutes.

863
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:15,078
Just a few minutes outside,
and then I'd be all right.

864
01:18:15,181 --> 01:18:17,741
Then I'd
come back inside.
Listen.

865
01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:20,910
I really think
the best thing to do is keep
talking about something else.

866
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:24,922
Then you won't think about it,
okay? What's your name?
Your name. What's your name?

867
01:18:26,759 --> 01:18:28,693
Don't ya have a name?
I don't think so.

868
01:18:28,795 --> 01:18:32,959
Well, sure you have a name.
Everybody's got a name.
Bruce, Howard, Richard...

869
01:18:33,066 --> 01:18:35,364
Oscar. My name
is Oscar Lindquist.

870
01:18:35,468 --> 01:18:37,368
Oscar Lindquist?
It's stuffy in here.

871
01:18:37,470 --> 01:18:41,201
No, no, no, let's keep
our clothes on, Oscar.
Now, where do you live?

872
01:18:41,307 --> 01:18:44,333
Who?
Oscar Lindquist.
Where do you live,
Oscar Lindquist?

873
01:18:44,444 --> 01:18:46,935
Keep talking.
Where do you live?
In an elevator!

874
01:18:47,046 --> 01:18:49,879
You don't live in an elevator.
You live in a house. Now concentrate!

875
01:18:49,982 --> 01:18:54,442
411 East 74th Street. I've
gotta stop breathing so much.
I'm gonna use up all the air.

876
01:18:54,554 --> 01:18:56,613
Keep talking, Oscar.
Keep talking.

877
01:18:56,722 --> 01:18:59,282
That's not fair.
You should breathe
some of the air.

878
01:18:59,392 --> 01:19:02,293
I can breathe.
Now listen.
Where do you work?

879
01:19:02,395 --> 01:19:06,058
The Excelsior Life Insurance
company. "Your life is our
business." I'm an actuary.

880
01:19:06,165 --> 01:19:09,396
What's an actuary?
I figure out premiums
based on the probabilities.

881
01:19:09,502 --> 01:19:11,629
Good, Oscar.
Now what's a probability?
The odds.

882
01:19:11,737 --> 01:19:14,638
The odds on what?
Keep talking.
Suppose you
wanted a policy.

883
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:19,973
Yes, I want a policy. Go on.
It's my job to study
your particular situation...

884
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:23,344
Yes.
And then figure out
the odds...

885
01:19:23,449 --> 01:19:26,213
on your meeting with
an unfortunate accident...

886
01:19:26,319 --> 01:19:28,753
like... like suffo...

887
01:19:30,289 --> 01:19:32,985
suff...

888
01:19:33,092 --> 01:19:35,026
suffocating in an elevator.

889
01:19:35,128 --> 01:19:37,187
Oscar! Mr. Lindquist!

890
01:19:38,931 --> 01:19:40,831
Are you all right?

891
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:47,229
Boy, this is really
my lucky day.

892
01:19:49,809 --> 01:19:54,712
Of all the millions of guys
in town, I wind up with
a candidate for the funny farm.

893
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,150
Not too bad-lookin' though.

894
01:20:00,353 --> 01:20:02,355
For a fruitcake.

895
01:20:02,355 --> 01:20:02,753
For a fruitcake.

896
01:20:02,855 --> 01:20:05,187
It's a nice face

897
01:20:05,291 --> 01:20:07,191
As faces go

898
01:20:07,293 --> 01:20:10,751
It's a very nice face

899
01:20:10,863 --> 01:20:13,923
With a place
for every feature

900
01:20:14,033 --> 01:20:16,331
Every feature in its place

901
01:20:18,271 --> 01:20:20,171
Not a commonplace face

902
01:20:22,642 --> 01:20:25,611
His eyes

903
01:20:25,711 --> 01:20:27,702
Blue

904
01:20:27,813 --> 01:20:31,476
His chin's stubborn and strong

905
01:20:33,519 --> 01:20:35,419
His ears

906
01:20:36,722 --> 01:20:39,384
They're ordinary ears

907
01:20:40,826 --> 01:20:43,590
His nose

908
01:20:43,696 --> 01:20:45,596
A little long

909
01:20:48,034 --> 01:20:49,934
Still

910
01:20:50,036 --> 01:20:52,197
It's a gentle face

911
01:20:54,607 --> 01:20:58,043
A little square
A little corny

912
01:20:59,212 --> 01:21:02,375
It's a sentimental face

913
01:21:05,718 --> 01:21:08,243
If he'd smile

914
01:21:08,354 --> 01:21:10,914
He'd look like so

915
01:21:12,491 --> 01:21:14,755
When he's mad

916
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:17,124
He'd look like so

917
01:21:20,466 --> 01:21:22,366
So

918
01:21:30,343 --> 01:21:32,368
Don't make this
a federal case

919
01:21:32,478 --> 01:21:34,912
It's just another pretty face

920
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:39,250
But you know:

921
01:21:41,254 --> 01:21:45,384
It's a very, very

922
01:21:47,893 --> 01:21:49,793
Very nice

923
01:21:51,197 --> 01:21:54,826
Face

924
01:21:54,934 --> 01:21:57,801
Where am I?
Do you remember
where you were before?

925
01:21:57,903 --> 01:21:59,803
No.
Well, you're
still there.

926
01:21:59,905 --> 01:22:02,806
Oh, my God!
Don't leave me!
I won't leave you, Oscar.

927
01:22:02,908 --> 01:22:05,706
I promise. I'll stay right here
in this elevator with you,

928
01:22:05,811 --> 01:22:09,042
and everything's
gonna be just fine.

929
01:22:09,148 --> 01:22:12,481
What happened?
I think
the lights went out.

930
01:22:12,585 --> 01:22:14,485
Oh, boy!

931
01:22:16,289 --> 01:22:18,484
Help.
Help.

932
01:22:18,591 --> 01:22:20,889
Help.
Help.

933
01:22:20,993 --> 01:22:23,086
Help.

934
01:22:23,195 --> 01:22:25,095
Help! Help!

935
01:26:09,174 --> 01:26:12,871
Help.
Help.

936
01:26:12,978 --> 01:26:16,937
Help.

937
01:26:17,049 --> 01:26:19,449
Oscar, Oscar!
The lights are on.

938
01:26:19,552 --> 01:26:24,512
Push the button.
Push the button!
Yes.

939
01:26:24,623 --> 01:26:26,682
Oh!
It's moving.
It's moving!

940
01:26:26,792 --> 01:26:29,260
<i>
Oh, it's moving!</i>

941
01:26:33,766 --> 01:26:37,497
Well, of course,
your big problem is panic.

942
01:26:37,603 --> 01:26:40,697
Seventy-eight percent
of your common
household accidents...

943
01:26:40,806 --> 01:26:44,105
could be avoided
by calm, clearheaded thinking.

944
01:26:47,212 --> 01:26:49,772
Well.

945
01:26:49,882 --> 01:26:51,850
See ya around.

946
01:26:53,152 --> 01:26:55,120
Around.

947
01:27:03,862 --> 01:27:06,695
Ah, miss?
Miss, what, uh...

948
01:27:06,799 --> 01:27:09,233
Do... Do you
suppose we could...

949
01:27:09,335 --> 01:27:12,998
Well, you know, uh, uh...
Do you think that
maybe that...

950
01:27:13,105 --> 01:27:15,232
That I don't suppose
that we could...

951
01:27:15,341 --> 01:27:19,277
I know you're tryin' to ask me
for somethin', but ya gotta
give me a bigger hint.

952
01:27:19,378 --> 01:27:22,836
Well, can I see ya
this Sunday?

953
01:27:22,948 --> 01:27:24,916
Aren't ya late
for work or somethin'?

954
01:27:25,017 --> 01:27:29,818
Well, I was supposed to
go to, to group analysis,
but I guess I missed it.

955
01:27:29,922 --> 01:27:34,791
You gonna be all right?
Oh, yes. It was my last
session this week anyway.

956
01:27:34,893 --> 01:27:37,293
I'm finished.
Good.

957
01:27:37,396 --> 01:27:42,459
What was your problem?
Well, one of
my problems was that...

958
01:27:42,568 --> 01:27:44,695
I was painfully shy.

959
01:27:44,803 --> 01:27:48,136
Oh. And now
you're cured?

960
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:52,904
No, I...
I never had the nerve to
bring it up, so I quit.

961
01:27:54,013 --> 01:27:56,208
I guess you're
busy Sunday.

962
01:27:56,315 --> 01:28:01,309
Look, can I ask you
a personal question?

963
01:28:01,420 --> 01:28:05,049
You're not otherwise
affiliated, are ya?

964
01:28:05,157 --> 01:28:10,424
Like a wife?
Oh, no! No, no,
nothing like that.

965
01:28:10,529 --> 01:28:13,930
Are you busy Sunday?
No.

966
01:28:14,033 --> 01:28:17,230
Oh, well, uh,
where do you live?

967
01:28:17,336 --> 01:28:19,827
Maybe you prefer
to meet me somewhere.

968
01:28:19,938 --> 01:28:22,771
Are you familiar
with that little bridge
in Central Park?

969
01:28:24,677 --> 01:28:27,771
Yeah, well, maybe we better
forget the whole thing.

970
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:31,008
Please, 2:00, Sunday?

971
01:28:31,116 --> 01:28:34,552
<i>L- lf you're not there,
I'll understand.</i>

972
01:28:34,653 --> 01:28:39,920
<i>I'll be there anyway.
I've got nothing else to do.</i>

973
01:28:41,593 --> 01:28:45,461
I must be out of my head.
What am I doin' here?

974
01:28:45,564 --> 01:28:47,464
Mmm-uh.

975
01:28:51,603 --> 01:28:55,334
Charity!

976
01:28:56,942 --> 01:28:59,706
I'm glad you
could make it.

977
01:28:59,812 --> 01:29:04,408
I thought after what
happened in the elevator
you might think I was...

978
01:29:04,516 --> 01:29:09,419
Well, you know,
some kind of a nut.

979
01:29:09,521 --> 01:29:12,752
Oh!
I almost forgot.

980
01:29:12,858 --> 01:29:18,728
Here. I grow them myself
in my apartment.

981
01:29:18,831 --> 01:29:22,267
Do you mind
if we get off this bridge?
Oh, sure, sure.

982
01:29:22,367 --> 01:29:26,929
Listen, I've made all kinds
of plans for today.
I thought maybe...

983
01:29:50,028 --> 01:29:53,020
Mmm-hmm. Here it comes:

984
01:29:53,132 --> 01:29:55,862
<i>The "I must have left my wallet
in my other pants" routine.</i>

985
01:29:58,303 --> 01:30:01,966
Well, forget it, Charlie.
You ain't gettin' a nickel outta me.

986
01:30:37,476 --> 01:30:39,706
Do you like modern art?

987
01:30:39,812 --> 01:30:43,714
I have several really fine
reproductions at home.

988
01:30:43,816 --> 01:30:46,444
Do you know where
I'd like to take you now?

989
01:30:46,552 --> 01:30:50,784
Yeah, to your place,
to look at your reproductions.

990
01:31:40,138 --> 01:31:43,596
Boy, if Nickie and Helene
could see me now.

991
01:31:43,709 --> 01:31:47,167
Who are Nickie and Helene?
Two of the girls
I work with.

992
01:31:47,279 --> 01:31:52,182
I've been so busy talking
I haven't given you
a chance to say anything.

993
01:31:52,284 --> 01:31:55,048
Where do you work?
Well...

994
01:31:55,153 --> 01:31:58,452
Nope, wait,
let me guess, because
usually I can just look...

995
01:31:58,557 --> 01:32:00,855
at a person and tell you
right off what they do.

996
01:32:00,959 --> 01:32:05,953
I'd say you definitely
work... in a bank.

997
01:32:07,799 --> 01:32:10,859
Am I right?
Did I get it?

998
01:32:10,969 --> 01:32:12,869
You got it.

999
01:32:12,971 --> 01:32:17,840
Well, you see, it's,
it's kind of a sixth sense.
Which bank?

1000
01:32:17,943 --> 01:32:20,844
<i>You familiar
with Brooklyn?
No.</i>

1001
01:32:20,946 --> 01:32:24,040
It's in Brooklyn.
You want a stick of gum?

1002
01:32:24,149 --> 01:32:26,083
No, thank you.

1003
01:32:26,184 --> 01:32:28,084
See, I, I...

1004
01:32:39,231 --> 01:32:43,224
Working in a bank
can be very dangerous,
you know?

1005
01:32:43,335 --> 01:32:47,396
In the greater New York area
the odds are 1 in 75
that you will be held up...

1006
01:32:47,506 --> 01:32:50,100
at least once
in any 12-month period.

1007
01:32:50,208 --> 01:32:54,167
Listen, just livin'
is dangerous, right?

1008
01:32:54,279 --> 01:32:57,180
May I see you home?
Where do you live in Brooklyn?

1009
01:32:57,282 --> 01:33:00,410
Oh, it's...
it's way far out.

1010
01:33:00,519 --> 01:33:03,113
And it's late.
You got to get up early.

1011
01:33:03,221 --> 01:33:06,315
I'll be okay.
Honest.

1012
01:33:08,961 --> 01:33:14,092
Uh, listen.
May I see you tomorrow?
Maybe we could go to a movie.

1013
01:33:14,199 --> 01:33:18,397
Okay, but one
with a happy ending.
I'm nuts about happy endings.

1014
01:33:18,503 --> 01:33:22,530
Good! I'll pick ya up at 5:00
in front of the bank, okay?

1015
01:33:27,913 --> 01:33:29,972
Suppose we, uh, meet...

1016
01:33:30,082 --> 01:33:33,483
At the bridge.

1017
01:33:34,619 --> 01:33:38,214
Night.
Good night.

1018
01:33:38,323 --> 01:33:42,783
Oh, look, I want you to know
I had a very nice time.

1019
01:33:42,894 --> 01:33:45,658
Being with you,
I mean.
So did I, Oscar.

1020
01:33:45,764 --> 01:33:49,757
A very nice time.
I had a very nice time too.

1021
01:33:50,869 --> 01:33:52,962
Well.
Well.

1022
01:33:58,276 --> 01:34:01,803
You're a lovely girl,
Charity.

1023
01:34:03,782 --> 01:34:05,682
Sweet Charity.

1024
01:34:18,497 --> 01:34:21,466
Gee, for a weirdo,
he's very nice.

1025
01:34:36,782 --> 01:34:40,445
Oh! I just live
around the corner.

1026
01:34:43,355 --> 01:34:45,289
"Sweet Charity."

1027
01:34:46,458 --> 01:34:48,858
Sweet Charity?

1028
01:34:49,961 --> 01:34:52,828
Hmm, Sweet Charity.

1029
01:34:54,366 --> 01:34:57,028
Hey, Nickie, Helene,
guess what happened?

1030
01:34:57,135 --> 01:34:59,865
Something every girl
in the ballroom dreams about!

1031
01:34:59,971 --> 01:35:03,168
You've been drafted!

1032
01:35:03,275 --> 01:35:06,574
No, I met a man,
a nice man.

1033
01:35:06,678 --> 01:35:10,114
Here it is, folks,
the 11:00 news.
We listen to it every night.

1034
01:35:10,215 --> 01:35:13,480
Can you imagine, I spent
the whole afternoon with him...

1035
01:35:13,585 --> 01:35:16,554
and he never once tried
any funny business, not once.

1036
01:35:16,655 --> 01:35:22,025
All he did was kiss my hand.
Hey, that's not makin' a pass, is it?

1037
01:35:22,127 --> 01:35:25,563
Naw. Is it, Helene?
What?

1038
01:35:25,664 --> 01:35:29,532
If a guy kisses your hand,
would you classify that
as a pass?

1039
01:35:29,634 --> 01:35:31,568
<i>Depends.
On what?</i>

1040
01:35:31,670 --> 01:35:35,128
On where your hand is
when he kisses it.

1041
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:37,708
Ha, ha! Hey,
where was your hand?

1042
01:35:37,809 --> 01:35:39,504
On the end of my arm!

1043
01:35:39,611 --> 01:35:43,672
Okay, so besides slobbering
all over your knuckles,
what else does he do?

1044
01:35:43,782 --> 01:35:46,342
He's a reactionary.
A what?

1045
01:35:46,451 --> 01:35:49,147
He figures out odds.
A horse player.

1046
01:35:49,254 --> 01:35:53,213
No! For an
insurance company.
And he also grows flowers.

1047
01:35:53,325 --> 01:35:56,852
<i>Sounds like a goofball.
He is not a goofball.</i>

1048
01:35:56,962 --> 01:35:59,226
What does the goofball
think of your profession?

1049
01:35:59,331 --> 01:36:02,630
<i>Have you told him you're in
the rent-a-body business?</i>

1050
01:36:02,734 --> 01:36:05,931
Well, it just so happens
he doesn't think anything of it.

1051
01:36:06,037 --> 01:36:08,005
She ain't told him.

1052
01:36:08,106 --> 01:36:12,338
He is very highly educated.
A little thing like that
wouldn't bother him.

1053
01:36:12,444 --> 01:36:16,505
He already knows
because I already told him.

1054
01:36:16,615 --> 01:36:18,515
You told him?
Yep.

1055
01:36:18,617 --> 01:36:20,915
<i>- You mean you really told him?
- I told him! I told him!</i>

1056
01:36:21,019 --> 01:36:24,250
- When?
- Tomorrow, that's
when I told him.

1057
01:36:34,399 --> 01:36:36,333
Do you like peanuts?

1058
01:36:36,434 --> 01:36:38,459
Yep.

1059
01:36:38,570 --> 01:36:40,504
For our anniversary.
Huh?

1060
01:36:40,605 --> 01:36:46,339
It's exactly two weeks since
we were trapped together between
the ninth and tenth floor.

1061
01:36:46,444 --> 01:36:48,605
Boy, what a two weeks
this has been too.

1062
01:36:48,713 --> 01:36:53,446
We've been to six movies,
four museums, a lecture on
air pollution and a pet show.

1063
01:36:53,552 --> 01:36:55,452
I'd like to do something
different tonight.

1064
01:36:55,554 --> 01:36:57,715
You want to rob
a supermarket?

1065
01:36:57,822 --> 01:37:01,622
Would you like
to go to church?
To church?

1066
01:37:01,726 --> 01:37:04,559
<i>It's the Rhythm of Life Tabernacle.</i>

1067
01:37:04,663 --> 01:37:09,862
<i>It started out as
a jazz group in San Francisco
and turned into a religion.</i>

1068
01:37:28,386 --> 01:37:31,685
Hey, baby, like,
let there be light.

1069
01:37:33,592 --> 01:37:36,789
Lights! Lights!
Lights!

1070
01:37:37,896 --> 01:37:39,523
<i>Oh, yeah!
Lights!</i>

1071
01:37:40,799 --> 01:37:42,858
<i>Get it! Get it!</i>

1072
01:37:42,968 --> 01:37:44,230
Ow!

1073
01:37:46,571 --> 01:37:48,505
<i>Ow!</i>

1074
01:38:00,018 --> 01:38:02,009
Let there be light!

1075
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:04,384
Ow!

1076
01:38:11,062 --> 01:38:13,530
And the title of the sermon
tonight will be...

1077
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:17,693
"We Have Beat Our Swords
Into Plowshares"
and the beat goes on.

1078
01:38:17,802 --> 01:38:20,737
<i>Swing it, Daddy!
Oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

1079
01:38:32,050 --> 01:38:34,678
Daddy started out
in San Francisco

1080
01:38:34,786 --> 01:38:37,414
Tootin' on his trumpet
loud and mean

1081
01:38:37,522 --> 01:38:40,184
Suddenly a voice said
Go forth, Daddy

1082
01:38:40,292 --> 01:38:42,760
Spread the picture
on a wider screen

1083
01:38:42,861 --> 01:38:45,762
And the voice said
Daddy, there's
a million pigeons

1084
01:38:45,864 --> 01:38:48,492
Waitin' to be hooked
on new religions

1085
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,761
Hit the road, Daddy
leave your common-law wife

1086
01:38:50,869 --> 01:38:53,667
Spread the religion
of the rhythm of life

1087
01:38:53,772 --> 01:38:56,570
And the rhythm of life
is a powerful beat

1088
01:38:56,675 --> 01:38:59,109
Puts a tingle in your fingers
and a tingle in your feet

1089
01:38:59,210 --> 01:39:01,974
Rhythm in your bedroom
rhythm in the street

1090
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,480
Yes, the rhythm of life
is a powerful beat

1091
01:39:04,582 --> 01:39:08,109
To feel
the rhythm of life

1092
01:39:08,219 --> 01:39:10,278
To feel
the powerful beat

1093
01:39:10,388 --> 01:39:13,585
To feel the tingle
in your fingers

1094
01:39:13,692 --> 01:39:15,626
To feel the tingle
in your feet

1095
01:39:15,727 --> 01:39:18,696
Daddy, go

1096
01:39:18,797 --> 01:39:21,391
Go, go, go

1097
01:39:21,499 --> 01:39:26,801
Tell them everything
you know

1098
01:39:26,905 --> 01:39:29,703
Daddy spread the gospel
in Milwaukee

1099
01:39:29,808 --> 01:39:32,538
Took his walkie-talkie
to Rocky Ridge

1100
01:39:32,644 --> 01:39:35,204
Blew his way to Canton
then to Scranton

1101
01:39:35,313 --> 01:39:38,407
'Til he landed
under the Manhattan Bridge

1102
01:39:38,516 --> 01:39:40,643
Daddy was a new sensation
got himself a congregation

1103
01:39:40,752 --> 01:39:43,152
Built up quite
an operation down below

1104
01:39:43,254 --> 01:39:46,121
With the pie-eyed piper
blowing while
the muscatel was flowing

1105
01:39:46,224 --> 01:39:48,749
All the cats
were go-go-going
Down below

1106
01:39:48,860 --> 01:39:52,193
Daddy was
a new sensation

1111
01:40:11,049 --> 01:40:13,779
Flip your wings

Daddy, we've got
the rhythm of life

1170
01:43:09,594 --> 01:43:13,121
<i>- Of life, of life
of life
- Yeah!</i>

1171
01:43:13,231 --> 01:43:14,459
- Let me hear it!
- Yeah!

1172
01:43:14,566 --> 01:43:15,828
- Sock it to me!
- Yeah!

- Yeah!

1174
01:43:21,906 --> 01:43:23,874
Gather round.

1175
01:43:27,645 --> 01:43:30,842
Yeah, this is where
it's all happenin', babies.

1176
01:43:30,949 --> 01:43:35,249
"The Rhythm of Life,"
number seven
in the top ten religions.

1177
01:43:35,353 --> 01:43:37,821
We're gonna climb
to number one, Big Daddy.

1178
01:43:37,922 --> 01:43:40,686
I'm hip, baby.
But dig.

1179
01:43:40,792 --> 01:43:45,092
Time is runnin' out
on that big L.P. Called life.

1180
01:43:45,196 --> 01:43:48,791
And the greatest disc jockey
of them all is gonna come
and take us by the hand...

1181
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:51,664
and lead us to the flip side
of life called eternity.

1182
01:43:51,769 --> 01:43:54,067
Eternity!

1183
01:43:54,172 --> 01:43:57,403
That big coffee break
in the sky.

1184
01:43:57,508 --> 01:44:00,170
Yeah, but before we groove
that final date...

1185
01:44:00,278 --> 01:44:05,306
before we head for that last...
Eight bars,

1186
01:44:05,416 --> 01:44:07,509
we gotta make our peace!

1187
01:44:07,619 --> 01:44:10,679
Make it, Daddy.
Make it, Daddy.
Make it, Daddy.

1188
01:44:10,788 --> 01:44:12,756
You know I'm gonna make it!

1189
01:44:12,857 --> 01:44:17,089
I want you cats to listen
to everything I'm gonna
lay on ya as of this point.

1190
01:44:17,195 --> 01:44:19,561
Number one!

1191
01:44:19,664 --> 01:44:23,361
Thou shalt dig thy neighbor as
thou wouldst have him dig thee.

1192
01:44:23,468 --> 01:44:26,403
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1193
01:44:26,504 --> 01:44:28,472
Number two!

1194
01:44:28,573 --> 01:44:30,598
Thou shall not put down
thy mamas and thy papas!

1195
01:44:30,708 --> 01:44:33,404
No, no, no, no.

1196
01:44:33,511 --> 01:44:36,708
Number three!
Thou shall not swing
with another cat's chick.

1197
01:44:36,814 --> 01:44:39,214
No, no, no, no.

1198
01:44:39,317 --> 01:44:41,217
Number four!

1199
01:44:41,319 --> 01:44:45,415
Thou shall not blow
thy minds on school nights
and national holidays.

1200
01:44:45,523 --> 01:44:49,084
They're a very devout group.
Where did you
ever find them?

1201
01:44:49,193 --> 01:44:51,787
I'm on a mailing list.
It's a Church of the Month club.

1202
01:44:51,896 --> 01:44:55,297
And last!
Come here.

1203
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:57,391
But not least.

1204
01:44:57,502 --> 01:45:00,835
Thou shall not
indulge thyselves in
the evil marijuana weed...

1205
01:45:00,938 --> 01:45:03,907
commonly known as pot,
grass, Mary Jane...

1206
01:45:04,008 --> 01:45:08,138
Acapulco Gold,
as it is sinful.

1207
01:45:08,246 --> 01:45:13,980
It is harmful!
It's also very expensive!

1208
01:45:14,085 --> 01:45:17,851
So I suggest,
if anybody's holdin',
drop it before the fuzz arrives.

1209
01:45:17,955 --> 01:45:19,923
Love, babies.

1210
01:45:20,024 --> 01:45:24,154
Love, Daddy.

1211
01:45:26,898 --> 01:45:28,798
Yeah.

1212
01:46:00,331 --> 01:46:02,799
Are they gone?

1213
01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:06,563
Hey, you're shaking.
I'm scared to death.

1214
01:46:06,671 --> 01:46:10,129
Don't... Don't...
Don't worry.
I'm right here beside you.

1215
01:46:10,241 --> 01:46:12,709
So just relax
and be scared all you want.

1216
01:46:12,810 --> 01:46:16,644
Thank you. I will.

1217
01:46:18,549 --> 01:46:20,710
Hey, you know something?

1218
01:46:20,818 --> 01:46:23,582
I don't mind
being scared with you.

1219
01:46:23,688 --> 01:46:26,555
I mean, when you've got
somebody you can depend on,

1220
01:46:26,657 --> 01:46:30,218
that you know
will be there all the time
to take care of you,

1221
01:46:30,328 --> 01:46:33,297
then you can afford
to be scared.

1222
01:46:33,397 --> 01:46:36,264
I never had a somebody
like that before.

1223
01:46:36,367 --> 01:46:39,700
I've never had anybody
depend on me before.

1224
01:46:39,804 --> 01:46:42,602
I think they're gone.

1225
01:46:42,707 --> 01:46:46,871
You know what I wish?
I wish we could stay
like this forever.

1226
01:46:46,978 --> 01:46:49,105
Oh, do you, Oscar?

1227
01:46:49,213 --> 01:46:53,240
Y-You're the first girl
I ever met that
I ever trusted...

1228
01:46:53,351 --> 01:46:55,319
and believed in.

1229
01:46:55,419 --> 01:47:00,220
And my whole right side
is going to sleep.

1230
01:47:00,324 --> 01:47:03,452
Wait. I'll scrunch down.

1231
01:47:05,263 --> 01:47:07,731
How's that?

1232
01:47:11,102 --> 01:47:15,300
Oh, Oscar,

1233
01:47:15,406 --> 01:47:19,570
I'm gonna tell you
something about me
I don't think you'll like.

1234
01:47:19,677 --> 01:47:22,612
Couldn't be anything
about you I wouldn't like.

1235
01:47:25,116 --> 01:47:29,246
Remember I told you
I worked in a bank?

1236
01:47:29,353 --> 01:47:31,719
A bank in Brooklyn.

1237
01:47:39,463 --> 01:47:42,455
What about that bank
in Brooklyn?

1238
01:47:42,567 --> 01:47:46,833
We just raised
our interest rates. Mmm.

1239
01:47:46,938 --> 01:47:49,099
Hey!
What's the matter?

1240
01:47:49,207 --> 01:47:52,574
Did you hear what I said?
I said I wish we could
stay in here forever.

1241
01:47:52,677 --> 01:47:55,077
D-Did you hear me say that?
Well, look where we are!

1242
01:47:55,179 --> 01:47:59,582
In a small, tight place
of the type I'm usually scared
to death to be in, but I'm not.

1243
01:47:59,684 --> 01:48:03,848
I like it!
I don't have
claustrophobia anymore.

1244
01:48:03,955 --> 01:48:07,254
I'm cured! You cured me.
I did? How?

1245
01:48:07,358 --> 01:48:09,952
I don't know,
but it's gone!

1246
01:48:10,061 --> 01:48:13,155
Ha, ha!
For the first time in my life.

1247
01:48:13,264 --> 01:48:14,532
It's gone! It's gone!

1248
01:48:14,532 --> 01:48:15,624
It's gone! It's gone!

1249
01:48:15,733 --> 01:48:18,031
Gone, gone, gone!

1250
01:48:21,639 --> 01:48:25,405
<i>Here was a man with
no dream and no plan</i>

1251
01:48:25,509 --> 01:48:30,276
<i>Then one lonely night
I found Sweet Charity</i>

1252
01:48:30,381 --> 01:48:33,316
<i>You make life fun for me</i>

1253
01:48:33,417 --> 01:48:35,612
<i>Oh, what it's done for me</i>

1254
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:40,714
<i>Having you around
Sweet Charity</i>

1255
01:48:40,825 --> 01:48:44,124
<i>Warm words
I've never said</i>

1256
01:48:44,228 --> 01:48:49,029
<i>Lately pop off
the top of my head</i>

1257
01:48:49,133 --> 01:48:52,330
<i>It's incredible</i>

1258
01:48:54,405 --> 01:48:58,899
<i>Suddenly I'm the guy
I never dared to be</i>

1259
01:48:59,010 --> 01:49:03,572
<i>Watch me touch the sky
quite easily</i>

1260
01:49:03,681 --> 01:49:08,243
<i>So if you are free
Sweet Charity</i>

1261
01:49:08,352 --> 01:49:12,982
<i>Please belong to me
sweet, Sweet Charity</i>

1262
01:49:13,090 --> 01:49:15,752
<i>Please belong to me</i>

1263
01:49:15,860 --> 01:49:18,590
<i>Sweet Charity</i>

1264
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:34,368
<i>Sweet Charity
please belong to me</i>

1265
01:49:34,478 --> 01:49:39,006
<i>Sweet Charity
please belong to me</i>

1266
01:49:39,116 --> 01:49:43,883
<i>Sweet Charity
please belong to me</i>

1267
01:49:43,988 --> 01:49:49,051
<i>Sweet Charity
please belong to me, please</i>

1268
01:49:50,361 --> 01:49:53,455
<i>Please</i>

1269
01:49:53,564 --> 01:49:55,464
Please?

1270
01:49:58,169 --> 01:50:03,163
Charity, I'd just about
given up ever finding
anybody like you.

1271
01:50:03,274 --> 01:50:07,233
I mean,
the world's gone crazy.
Everything's all mixed up.

1272
01:50:07,345 --> 01:50:11,281
The old standards
of decency and morality,

1273
01:50:11,382 --> 01:50:14,351
they don't seem
to mean anything anymore.

1274
01:50:14,452 --> 01:50:19,651
When I see the way
the girls at the office
are passed around...

1275
01:50:19,757 --> 01:50:22,851
and the jokes
they tell about them,

1276
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:26,396
I get sick, Charity.

1277
01:50:26,497 --> 01:50:29,523
Most people would laugh
if I told them that.

1278
01:50:29,633 --> 01:50:31,726
I'm not laughing, Oscar.

1279
01:50:31,836 --> 01:50:33,963
From the moment
we first met, I knew
you were different.

1280
01:50:34,071 --> 01:50:36,266
Like the way I knew
you worked in a bank.

1281
01:50:36,374 --> 01:50:38,274
Oscar, listen,
there's something...

1282
01:50:38,376 --> 01:50:40,844
I knew you believed
in the same things I did.
Things like,

1283
01:50:40,945 --> 01:50:45,245
Oh, innocence and...

1284
01:50:47,618 --> 01:50:49,779
Try purity.

1285
01:50:49,887 --> 01:50:53,846
Does that
sound corny?
No.

1286
01:50:53,958 --> 01:50:57,758
Well, yeah,
maybe it is.

1287
01:50:57,862 --> 01:51:01,764
B-But that's the way
I always pictured it would be.

1288
01:51:01,866 --> 01:51:05,427
The way it had to be.

1289
01:51:05,536 --> 01:51:09,996
No one else seems
to think those things are
important anymore, but...

1290
01:51:11,308 --> 01:51:16,712
that's why you're a very
special person, Charity.

1291
01:51:16,814 --> 01:51:18,714
Charity?

1292
01:51:20,017 --> 01:51:21,917
Charity?

1293
01:51:28,959 --> 01:51:31,450
<i>Do you wanna have fun</i>

1294
01:51:31,562 --> 01:51:33,462
<i>Cowboy, I wanna
tell ya something.
Fun, fun, fun</i>

1295
01:51:33,564 --> 01:51:36,055
A little secret
between you and me.
How's about a few

1296
01:51:36,167 --> 01:51:38,533
How about it, palsie?
Laughs, laughs

1297
01:51:38,636 --> 01:51:42,333
Mister, do you
speak Spanish?
I can show you a

1298
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:44,840
<i>Good time</i>

1299
01:52:39,396 --> 01:52:41,694
Hey, what's the big idea?

1300
01:52:43,801 --> 01:52:45,701
<i>Excuse me,
Miss Valentine!</i>

1301
01:52:45,803 --> 01:52:49,330
Your escort shelled out 6.50
to dance with you, and
I do not see you dancin'.

1302
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:52,341
Who dances?
You defend yourself to music!

1303
01:52:52,443 --> 01:52:54,434
Now, Miss Valentine...
You want to know
somethin', Herman?

1304
01:52:54,545 --> 01:52:56,604
I don't like it here
anymore.

1305
01:52:56,714 --> 01:53:00,673
So I'm givin' you
my two weeks notice
as of two weeks ago.

1306
01:53:00,784 --> 01:53:02,979
This is not
a nice place!

1307
01:53:14,965 --> 01:53:17,661
Charity?

1308
01:53:17,768 --> 01:53:21,033
Hey, Charity, listen...

1309
01:53:24,808 --> 01:53:26,742
Hey, baby?

1310
01:53:26,844 --> 01:53:29,745
Charity?
Hey!

1311
01:53:29,847 --> 01:53:32,816
<i>I'm up here.</i>

1312
01:53:32,917 --> 01:53:35,977
Boy, oh, boy, am I tired
of that musical snake pit
down there.

1313
01:53:36,086 --> 01:53:39,146
What's so bad about it?
You dance a little,

1314
01:53:39,256 --> 01:53:42,783
talk a little,
roll your eyes a little,
swivel your hips a little.

1315
01:53:42,893 --> 01:53:46,454
Just like that
you can kill a lifetime.

1316
01:53:46,564 --> 01:53:49,089
How are things going
with the goofball?

1317
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:53,534
Who?
You know,
the hand kisser.

1318
01:53:53,637 --> 01:53:56,868
Him? Who needs him?
I don't need him.
I don't need anybody.

1319
01:53:56,974 --> 01:54:01,536
If I needed anybody,
it sure wouldn't be him.
She's nuts about him.

1320
01:54:05,216 --> 01:54:09,050
It's no good.
He thinks I work in a bank.

1321
01:54:09,153 --> 01:54:11,348
<i>So? Let him!</i>

1322
01:54:11,455 --> 01:54:14,822
He trusts me;
he believes in me.

1323
01:54:14,925 --> 01:54:19,191
I gotta tell him the truth.
Who I am, what I do, all of it.

1324
01:54:19,296 --> 01:54:22,629
<i>That much truth
ain't good for nobody.</i>

1325
01:54:22,733 --> 01:54:25,634
I should have told him
before, but...

1326
01:54:25,736 --> 01:54:29,763
Oh, he's just the nicest thing
that ever happened to me.

1327
01:54:29,873 --> 01:54:31,864
I wanted it to last
as long as it could.

1328
01:54:31,976 --> 01:54:36,072
Let me get this straight.
You're gonna tell him
you lied to him?

1329
01:54:36,180 --> 01:54:40,378
<i>You're gonna
tell him you've been working
in this dump for eight years?</i>

1330
01:54:40,484 --> 01:54:41,951
Yep.

1331
01:54:42,052 --> 01:54:45,544
<i>You're gonna tell
about Frank and Charlie and...
Yep, yep.</i>

1332
01:54:45,656 --> 01:54:48,819
Oh, Charity,
I gotta hand it to you.

1333
01:54:48,926 --> 01:54:53,693
<i>You are an extremely
honest, open
and stupid broad.</i>

1334
01:54:55,766 --> 01:54:58,257
Yep.

1335
01:55:11,315 --> 01:55:13,545
Charity, what...

1336
01:55:13,651 --> 01:55:16,142
Sit down, Oscar.

1337
01:55:18,355 --> 01:55:20,755
Aren't you going
to sit with me?

1338
01:55:20,858 --> 01:55:23,793
I have some very important
things to say to you and...

1339
01:55:23,894 --> 01:55:27,091
if I have to look
in your eyes, I'll never
be able to say them.

1340
01:55:27,197 --> 01:55:29,392
You alone, miss?
She's with me.

1341
01:55:34,004 --> 01:55:37,496
Charity, I was asleep
when you called. I'm still
in my pajamas. Look.

1342
01:55:37,608 --> 01:55:41,100
Don't look at me!

1343
01:55:42,212 --> 01:55:45,079
Oscar...

1344
01:55:46,684 --> 01:55:50,882
I don't now, I never have...

1345
01:55:50,988 --> 01:55:53,684
and I probably
never, ever will...

1346
01:55:53,791 --> 01:55:56,055
work in a bank.
Oh.

1347
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:59,095
I don't even have
a bank account anymore.

1348
01:55:59,196 --> 01:56:03,963
Whatever money I do have,
I keep in an empty jar
of instant coffee.
Oh.

1349
01:56:04,068 --> 01:56:07,299
You know how I earn
that money, Oscar?
You're a dance hall hostess.

1350
01:56:07,404 --> 01:56:11,704
I'm a dance hall hostess.
I work in a cheap dance hall.

1351
01:56:11,809 --> 01:56:14,835
And I dance
with strange men...

1352
01:56:14,945 --> 01:56:19,382
and I drink with them
and sometimes...

1353
01:56:19,483 --> 01:56:21,849
sometimes...

1354
01:56:24,455 --> 01:56:27,618
Hey, how did you know?

1355
01:56:27,725 --> 01:56:32,287
When you left me in the
phone booth, I ran outside
looking for you.

1356
01:56:32,396 --> 01:56:35,763
I saw someone.
I thought it was you
and I followed her.

1357
01:56:35,866 --> 01:56:39,495
She went into
that... that place.

1358
01:56:39,603 --> 01:56:42,037
Then I knew it wasn't you.

1359
01:56:42,139 --> 01:56:46,098
Except I saw the photographs
outside, and it was you.

1360
01:56:47,711 --> 01:56:51,147
I didn't go in.
I couldn't.

1361
01:56:51,248 --> 01:56:53,773
I went home.

1362
01:56:55,819 --> 01:56:58,982
I tried to hate you,
Charity.

1363
01:56:59,089 --> 01:57:01,717
I tried very hard.

1364
01:57:02,926 --> 01:57:05,656
But I couldn't.

1365
01:57:05,763 --> 01:57:07,697
I just couldn't hate you.

1366
01:57:07,798 --> 01:57:11,825
Maybe you'll have
better luck tonight when I get
finished telling you the rest.

1367
01:57:11,935 --> 01:57:14,335
It's not important.

1368
01:57:14,438 --> 01:57:17,032
"Not important"?

1369
01:57:17,141 --> 01:57:20,872
What do you mean,
not important? What about
all those things you said?

1370
01:57:20,978 --> 01:57:24,243
Look, Charity...
Don't look at me!

1371
01:57:25,816 --> 01:57:29,946
Charity, I know what I said.

1372
01:57:30,053 --> 01:57:33,489
But I just can't
let you get away.
You have to marry me.

1373
01:57:33,590 --> 01:57:35,615
Oscar, I've gotta
tell you everything!

1374
01:57:35,726 --> 01:57:39,059
I don't care what you are
or what you've done.
If you only knew.

1375
01:57:39,163 --> 01:57:42,894
If you only knew,
all those guys.

1376
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:46,094
All those guys that...

1377
01:57:50,140 --> 01:57:53,576
Charity, don't cry.
Please, don't cry.
I believe you.

1378
01:57:53,677 --> 01:57:57,579
I know you believe me! I'm
crying about that other part!

1379
01:57:57,681 --> 01:58:03,244
What other part?
That marrying part! I didn't
hear it the first time!

1380
01:58:12,930 --> 01:58:14,898
Excuse me, sport.

1381
01:58:19,369 --> 01:58:21,337
Marry me?

1382
01:58:21,438 --> 01:58:23,338
Oscar!

1383
01:58:32,049 --> 01:58:35,280
You're not just makin' fun
of me, are ya?

1384
01:58:35,385 --> 01:58:40,220
Because askin' a girl
to marry her is one
of her most sensitive areas.

1385
01:58:40,324 --> 01:58:42,849
You really shouldn't say it
if you don't mean it.

1386
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:47,659
I mean, you can
seriously hurt a person
kiddin' around like that.

1387
01:58:47,764 --> 01:58:49,959
To tell you the truth,
Oscar,

1388
01:58:50,067 --> 01:58:53,002
I don't think I could stand
another injury of that nature.

1389
01:58:53,103 --> 01:58:57,199
You know, for the first time,
I'm happy.

1390
01:58:57,307 --> 01:59:00,708
I mean, really happy inside!
And it's all because of you!

1391
01:59:00,811 --> 01:59:03,644
Oh!
Don't look at me!

1392
01:59:03,747 --> 01:59:07,649
I can get pretty
emotional too, you know.

1393
01:59:07,751 --> 01:59:09,651
Give me your hand.

1394
01:59:17,361 --> 01:59:20,797
Charity, you know what
we're gonna do? We're gonna
get out of this city.

1395
01:59:20,898 --> 01:59:23,526
Oh, I'd like that.
We'll move to the country.

1396
01:59:23,634 --> 01:59:26,432
I'd like that.
New Jersey maybe!

1397
01:59:26,537 --> 01:59:31,440
We'll open a nursery
and greenhouse, grow flowers.
You'd like that.

1398
01:59:31,542 --> 01:59:34,443
The important thing
is to forget about the past.
I've forgot it.

1399
01:59:34,545 --> 01:59:37,241
It's not important.
It's not important.
It isn't.

1400
01:59:37,347 --> 01:59:40,839
We won't discuss it anymore.
We won't even think about it,
especially not think about it.

1401
01:59:40,951 --> 01:59:44,250
We won't think about it.
A lot of men couldn't do that,
but not me.

1402
01:59:44,354 --> 01:59:49,451
Not you.
I'll never mention it again
as long as I live.

1403
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:51,494
I'd like that.

1404
01:59:51,595 --> 01:59:56,623
Because I need you,
Charity.

1405
02:00:00,003 --> 02:00:03,666
I need you...
and I love you.

1406
02:00:06,310 --> 02:00:10,804
Besides, it's about time
I got married anyway.

1407
02:00:10,914 --> 02:00:13,144
I'm 34 years old.

1408
02:00:13,250 --> 02:00:17,949
<i>He loves... me.
Did you know that
the odds are 785...</i>

1409
02:00:19,323 --> 02:00:21,655
Someone loves me.

1410
02:00:22,893 --> 02:00:25,191
Someone loves me!

1411
02:00:26,964 --> 02:00:31,196
Some... one... loves... me!

1412
02:00:32,970 --> 02:00:37,964
<i>Some... one... loves... me!
Some... one... loves... me!</i>

1413
02:00:53,457 --> 02:00:55,618
Somebody loves me

1414
02:00:55,726 --> 02:00:58,126
My heart
is beating so fast

1415
02:00:58,228 --> 02:01:02,631
All kinds of music
is pouring out of me

1416
02:01:02,733 --> 02:01:05,668
Somebody loves me

1417
02:01:05,769 --> 02:01:07,794
At last

1418
02:01:07,904 --> 02:01:09,804
Now

1419
02:01:11,541 --> 02:01:14,840
I'm a brass band
I'm a harpsichord

1420
02:01:14,945 --> 02:01:18,176
I'm a clarinet

1421
02:01:18,281 --> 02:01:21,876
I'm the Philadelphia
orchestra

1422
02:01:21,985 --> 02:01:25,386
I'm the modern
jazz quartet

1423
02:01:25,489 --> 02:01:28,617
I'm the band
from Macy's big parade

1424
02:01:28,725 --> 02:01:31,660
A wild Count Basie blast

1425
02:01:31,762 --> 02:01:35,129
I'm the bells of
St. Peter's in Rome

1426
02:01:35,232 --> 02:01:38,565
I'm tissue paper
on a comb

1427
02:01:38,669 --> 02:01:42,127
And all kinds of music

1428
02:01:42,239 --> 02:01:45,606
Is pouring out of me

1429
02:01:45,709 --> 02:01:50,237
'Cause somebody
loves me at last

1430
02:02:39,062 --> 02:02:43,192
Somebody loves me

1431
02:03:37,254 --> 02:03:40,690
She's a brass band
She's a harpsichord

1432
02:03:40,791 --> 02:03:43,919
She's a clarinet

1433
02:03:44,027 --> 02:03:47,793
She's the Philadelphia
orchestra

1434
02:03:47,898 --> 02:03:51,061
The modern jazz quartet

1435
02:04:59,769 --> 02:05:03,068
She's a brass band
She's a harpsichord

1436
02:05:03,173 --> 02:05:05,004
She's a clarinet

1437
02:05:05,108 --> 02:05:06,871
That's me!

1438
02:05:06,977 --> 02:05:10,208
She's the Philadelphia
orchestra

1439
02:05:10,313 --> 02:05:13,111
She's the modern
jazz quartet

1440
02:05:13,216 --> 02:05:16,652
She's the band
from Macy's big parade

1441
02:05:16,753 --> 02:05:20,052
A wild Count Basie blast

1442
02:05:20,156 --> 02:05:20,257
<i>She's the bells
of St. Peter's in Rome</i>

1443
02:05:20,257 --> 02:05:23,124
<i>She's the bells
of St. Peter's in Rome</i>

1444
02:05:23,226 --> 02:05:26,423
She's tissue paper
on a comb

1445
02:05:34,437 --> 02:05:36,496
Somebody loves me

1446
02:05:43,013 --> 02:05:44,913
At last!

1447
02:06:28,425 --> 02:06:30,689
Oh, look, you don't
have to come in.

1448
02:06:30,794 --> 02:06:32,989
No, it's all right.
It's all right.

1449
02:06:33,096 --> 02:06:35,860
I'll just be a few minutes.
I'm fine, just fine.

1450
02:06:38,401 --> 02:06:41,427
Hmm. Hey,
anybody in there?

1451
02:06:43,039 --> 02:06:45,030
Oh, it's you.

1452
02:06:45,141 --> 02:06:47,109
Herman, what's goin' on?
How come you're closed?

1453
02:06:47,210 --> 02:06:49,269
Business stinks.
I sent everybody home.

1454
02:06:49,379 --> 02:06:53,145
Aw, but I called Nickie
and Helene and I told 'em
I was comin' by...

1455
02:06:53,249 --> 02:06:55,809
Hey, you heard the news.
I'm tyin' the knot.

1456
02:06:55,919 --> 02:06:58,649
I'm gettin' spliced!
I'm gettin' hitched!

1457
02:06:58,755 --> 02:07:00,655
Oh, yeah, I heard.
Look.

1458
02:07:00,757 --> 02:07:02,657
This is him.
This is the one.

1459
02:07:02,759 --> 02:07:06,923
Oscar Lindquist, this
is Herman, affectionately
known as der Fuhrer.

1460
02:07:07,030 --> 02:07:09,294
How do you do?
Right. Well,
I got work to do.

1461
02:07:09,399 --> 02:07:12,129
Wait, wait.
I got to get some things
out of my locker.

1462
02:07:12,235 --> 02:07:14,203
Okay, but don't take
none of the hangers.

1463
02:07:14,304 --> 02:07:16,829
Every time a girl leaves here,
she always takes all the hangers.

1464
02:07:16,940 --> 02:07:21,741
<i>He's kind of gruff on
the outside, but inside he's
really a very rotten person.</i>

1465
02:07:21,845 --> 02:07:25,747
<i>Herman, would ya
turn on a light?
You should know the way by now.</i>

1466
02:07:25,849 --> 02:07:27,749
Eight years of your life
you spend in a place...

1467
02:07:27,851 --> 02:07:30,149
and nobody even cares enough
to turn on a light.

1468
02:07:30,253 --> 02:07:33,814
Surprise!

1469
02:07:33,923 --> 02:07:35,948
We really fooled ya,
huh?

1470
02:07:36,059 --> 02:07:38,926
You didn't think we'd let ya
get away without givin' ya
a party?

1471
02:07:39,029 --> 02:07:42,829
You shouldn't have!
I told ya
we shouldn't have!

1472
02:07:52,308 --> 02:07:55,436
Everybody, everybody,
that's him!
That's the one!

1473
02:08:01,051 --> 02:08:03,349
This is
Mr. Oscar Lindquist!

1474
02:08:05,588 --> 02:08:07,351
This here, Oscar, is
Nickie and Helene. Remember
I told you so much about 'em?

1475
02:08:07,457 --> 02:08:09,482
<i>How do you...
All right, folks!</i>

1476
02:08:09,592 --> 02:08:12,686
<i>And now through the courtesy
of the hostesses here
at the Fandango Ballroom,</i>

1477
02:08:14,431 --> 02:08:16,058
in cooperation
with the waiters,

1478
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:20,398
Chet, the bouncer,
Irving, the cop,

1479
02:08:22,505 --> 02:08:25,338
And our three regular
customers since 1949,

1480
02:08:27,677 --> 02:08:30,612
We present...

1481
02:08:30,713 --> 02:08:32,613
A $17 cake!

1482
02:08:37,353 --> 02:08:39,719
"Happy Birthday, Angelo"?

1483
02:08:39,823 --> 02:08:42,155
You couldn't get a new cake,
ya cheapskate?

1484
02:08:42,258 --> 02:08:44,692
That's all they had
on such short notice.
Oh!

1485
02:08:44,794 --> 02:08:47,194
No, no, no!
It's the sentiment that counts.

1486
02:08:47,297 --> 02:08:51,393
I thank you
and Oscar thanks you
and Angelo thanks you.

1487
02:08:51,501 --> 02:08:54,902
You know something, pal?
For a broad she's got a lot of class.

1488
02:08:55,004 --> 02:08:56,904
Somebody get
Mr. Whatsit a beer.

1489
02:08:57,006 --> 02:09:01,067
The present,
the present!

1490
02:09:01,177 --> 02:09:06,080
Charity Hope Valentine,
we who have lived with you,
undressed with you,

1491
02:09:06,182 --> 02:09:09,879
suffered the indignities of
this crummy joint with you.
Aw!

1492
02:09:09,986 --> 02:09:13,581
We who have come to
know you and to love you,

1493
02:09:13,690 --> 02:09:16,887
on this,
your nuptial eve...

1494
02:09:16,993 --> 02:09:18,984
Shut up!

1495
02:09:19,095 --> 02:09:22,030
We just want to wish you...
I think I'm gonna cry.

1496
02:09:22,132 --> 02:09:25,397
Will ya quit slobberin'
all over the cake?

1497
02:09:25,502 --> 02:09:28,994
Get down! Let me do it!
Hold it down.

1498
02:09:29,105 --> 02:09:32,506
Charity, honey,
we just wanted to...

1499
02:09:32,609 --> 02:09:36,306
God, we're gonna
miss you, girl!

1500
02:09:36,412 --> 02:09:39,279
I'll give it to her.
I'm the one that
picked it out anyway.

1501
02:09:39,382 --> 02:09:44,149
Charity, please accept
this gift as a token
of our estimation.

1502
02:09:46,956 --> 02:09:49,424
I hope it's a nice gift.
I wonder what...

1503
02:09:49,526 --> 02:09:52,256
What the hell kind of
a wedding present is that?

1504
02:09:52,362 --> 02:09:56,856
I thought she was pregnant.
Isn't that why she's
getting married?

1505
02:09:59,769 --> 02:10:02,863
It's the nicest, nicest
wedding present I ever got.

1506
02:10:02,972 --> 02:10:05,907
<i>That a girl!</i>

1507
02:10:06,009 --> 02:10:09,501
All right, folks.
You know it ain't often that
one of our group goes off...

1508
02:10:09,612 --> 02:10:11,807
to marry a nice,
respectable guy.

1509
02:10:11,915 --> 02:10:14,110
As a matter of fact,
this is the first time
it's ever happened.

1510
02:10:14,217 --> 02:10:18,153
<i>So in honor of
our own blushing bride-to-be,</i>

1511
02:10:18,254 --> 02:10:22,384
Miss Charity Valentine,
I would like to say...

1512
02:10:22,492 --> 02:10:26,053
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

1513
02:10:26,162 --> 02:10:27,830
Gee!

1514
02:10:27,830 --> 02:10:28,091
Gee!

1515
02:10:28,198 --> 02:10:31,429
It's tough for a
loudmouthed mug like me

1516
02:10:31,534 --> 02:10:34,162
Who all the time
bellows like a bull

1517
02:10:36,339 --> 02:10:40,207
To make with the words
about the missus-to-be

1518
02:10:40,310 --> 02:10:43,643
When what you think is
an empty heart is full

1519
02:10:45,848 --> 02:10:49,545
Tomorrow when you say
I do

1520
02:10:49,652 --> 02:10:53,679
I'll die

1521
02:10:53,790 --> 02:10:56,588
<i>I'm almost too ashamed</i>

1522
02:10:56,693 --> 02:11:00,322
To tell you why

1523
02:11:02,432 --> 02:11:06,732
I

1524
02:11:06,836 --> 02:11:09,066
Love to cry at weddings

1525
02:11:09,172 --> 02:11:11,470
How I love to cry
at weddings

1526
02:11:11,574 --> 02:11:15,567
I walk into a chapel
and get happily hysterical

1527
02:11:15,678 --> 02:11:17,612
The ushers and attendants

1528
02:11:17,714 --> 02:11:19,648
The family dependents

1529
02:11:19,749 --> 02:11:21,842
I see them
and I start to sniff

1530
02:11:21,951 --> 02:11:24,010
Have you an
extra handkerchief

1531
02:11:24,120 --> 02:11:27,612
And all through the service
while the bride and groom look nervous

1532
02:11:27,724 --> 02:11:31,558
<i>Tears of joy are
streaming down my face
Down his face</i>

1533
02:11:31,661 --> 02:11:36,621
I love to cry at weddings
anybody's wedding

1534
02:11:36,733 --> 02:11:39,896
Anytime, anywhere, anyplace

1535
02:11:40,003 --> 02:11:41,937
I always weep at weddings

1536
02:11:42,038 --> 02:11:44,563
I'm a soggy creep at weddings

1537
02:11:44,674 --> 02:11:48,735
Oh, what's so sweet
and sloppy as, oh, promise me
and all that jazz

1538
02:11:48,845 --> 02:11:52,975
The man you rest
your head with, the man
you share your bed with

1539
02:11:53,082 --> 02:11:55,050
Is married to you so you know

1540
02:11:55,151 --> 02:11:57,119
He won't jump up
and dress and blow

1541
02:11:57,220 --> 02:12:00,986
- I could marry Herman
- And be permanently sorry

1542
02:12:01,090 --> 02:12:05,356
We would make
a really lousy pair

1543
02:12:05,461 --> 02:12:09,693
But, gee
I want a wedding
any kind of wedding

1544
02:12:09,799 --> 02:12:13,792
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere

1545
02:12:13,903 --> 02:12:18,203
And all through the service
while the bride and groom
look nervous

1546
02:12:18,308 --> 02:12:22,005
Tears of joy
are streaming down my face

1547
02:12:22,111 --> 02:12:26,047
I love to cry at weddings
anybody's wedding

1548
02:12:26,149 --> 02:12:28,617
Anytime, anywhere

1549
02:12:28,718 --> 02:12:30,811
Anyplace
doodle-le-do

1550
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:34,378
I love to cry at weddings

1551
02:12:34,490 --> 02:12:39,154
How I love to cry at weddings

1552
02:12:39,262 --> 02:12:43,631
I walk into a chapel
and get happily hysterical

1553
02:12:43,733 --> 02:12:47,169
The ushers
and attendants

1554
02:12:47,303 --> 02:12:51,865
The family dependents

1555
02:12:51,974 --> 02:12:53,942
I see them
and I start to sniff

1556
02:12:54,043 --> 02:12:56,341
Have you an
extra handkerchief

1557
02:12:56,446 --> 02:12:59,711
And all through the service

1558
02:12:59,816 --> 02:13:03,411
While the bride and groom
look nervous

1559
02:13:06,856 --> 02:13:09,450
I drink champagne

1560
02:13:09,559 --> 02:13:13,655
And sing Sweet Adeline

1561
02:13:18,301 --> 02:13:22,431
I love to cry

1562
02:13:22,538 --> 02:13:25,598
At weddings

1563
02:13:25,708 --> 02:13:31,408
Anybody's wedding

1564
02:13:31,514 --> 02:13:34,847
Just as long as it's not mine

1565
02:13:37,019 --> 02:13:39,988
Okay, everybody,
the food is on me!

1566
02:14:19,095 --> 02:14:21,325
Hey, Johnnie.
Uh, Lindquist.
Oscar Lindquist.

1567
02:14:21,431 --> 02:14:24,457
Yeah, you just make sure
you treat her right.
You get me?

1568
02:14:24,567 --> 02:14:26,467
Yes, of course.

1569
02:14:26,569 --> 02:14:28,935
'Cause she's entitled,
I mean, really entitled.

1570
02:14:29,038 --> 02:14:33,202
If I was to list all the
rotten deals that sweet, stupid,
hard-luck dame's been dealt...

1571
02:14:33,309 --> 02:14:35,300
If I was to tell you...
There's no need, really.

1572
02:14:35,411 --> 02:14:38,039
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You know all about it.

1573
02:14:38,147 --> 02:14:40,615
Frankly, I was dead set
against her telling ya
anything.

1574
02:14:40,716 --> 02:14:42,650
But it seems
you're a saint.

1575
02:14:42,752 --> 02:14:45,653
She tells you everything
and you say it doesn't
matter, right?

1576
02:14:45,755 --> 02:14:48,451
That's right.

1577
02:14:48,558 --> 02:14:50,458
Say it again.

1578
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:54,724
Ha, ha, she hasn't been makin'
a pitch for herself, has she?

1579
02:14:54,831 --> 02:14:57,561
Well, he's taken.

1580
02:14:57,667 --> 02:15:01,000
Hold this for me, would ya?
I'll be right back.

1581
02:15:18,788 --> 02:15:21,780
Well.
Well.

1582
02:15:21,891 --> 02:15:24,655
Well.

1583
02:15:26,829 --> 02:15:29,457
It can happen, though,
you see?

1584
02:15:29,565 --> 02:15:32,830
You just gotta keep hopin'.
That's the important thing.

1585
02:15:32,935 --> 02:15:36,063
I mean, miracles do happen.

1586
02:15:53,523 --> 02:15:56,856
Everybody, so long.
Bye!

1587
02:15:56,959 --> 02:16:01,157
I love to cry
at weddings

1588
02:16:01,264 --> 02:16:04,199
Anybody's wedding

1589
02:16:04,300 --> 02:16:08,134
Anytime, anyplace

1590
02:16:08,237 --> 02:16:12,139
Anywhere

1591
02:16:12,241 --> 02:16:14,141
I love to cry at weddings

1592
02:16:14,243 --> 02:16:16,609
How I love to cry
at weddings

1593
02:16:16,712 --> 02:16:20,148
I walk into a chapel
and get happily hysterical

1594
02:16:20,249 --> 02:16:23,047
The ushers
and attendants

The family dependents

1596

I see them

And all through the service
while the bride and groom

1599
02:16:35,231 --> 02:16:38,428
<i>Tears of joy
are streamin' down my face
Down his face</i>

1600
02:16:38,534 --> 02:16:40,434
I love

1601
02:16:40,536 --> 02:16:43,334
To cry at weddings
anybody's wedding

1602
02:16:43,439 --> 02:16:45,339
Anytime
Anytime

1603
02:16:45,441 --> 02:16:47,272
Anywhere
Anywhere

1604
02:16:47,376 --> 02:16:54,077
Anyplace
Anyplace

1605
02:17:39,028 --> 02:17:42,361
D-Didn't you see
the sign?

1606
02:17:42,465 --> 02:17:46,868
"Please do not throw
any rice in the halls
or on the stairs."

1607
02:17:46,969 --> 02:17:50,735
That's because one out of
every 42 accidents occurs
in a public building.

1608
02:17:50,840 --> 02:17:52,740
Oh. I'll be careful.

1609
02:17:54,043 --> 02:17:55,943
Look.

1610
02:17:57,747 --> 02:17:59,840
You like it?

1611
02:18:00,950 --> 02:18:03,316
Yeah, it's, uh...

1612
02:18:03,419 --> 02:18:07,116
It's, uh...
It caught my eye, you know.

1613
02:18:07,223 --> 02:18:10,522
You and your flowers
and everything.
Oh.

1614
02:18:10,626 --> 02:18:13,618
You don't like it?
No, I do, I do.

1615
02:18:13,729 --> 02:18:17,597
<i>It's very flowery.</i>

1616
02:18:20,970 --> 02:18:24,838
Boy, there sure are
a lot of questions here.

1617
02:18:24,940 --> 02:18:27,465
Okay, name:

1618
02:18:27,576 --> 02:18:31,307
Charity Hope Valentine.

1619
02:18:31,414 --> 02:18:35,714
Soon to become
Mrs. Oscar Lindquist.

1620
02:18:35,818 --> 02:18:39,720
Age...
Yeah, what the hell?

1621
02:18:39,822 --> 02:18:43,053
Heck.

1622
02:18:43,159 --> 02:18:46,617
Place of birth:
New York, New York.

1623
02:18:46,729 --> 02:18:50,529
New York.

1624
02:18:51,634 --> 02:18:54,228
Identifying marks?
What are they?

1625
02:18:54,336 --> 02:18:59,467
You know,
scars, birthmarks,

1626
02:18:59,575 --> 02:19:01,839
tattoos.

1627
02:19:05,614 --> 02:19:07,707
Oh. Tattoo.

1628
02:19:07,817 --> 02:19:10,980
I'm gonna have it taken off,
Oscar, you know.

1629
02:19:11,087 --> 02:19:14,079
Occupation:
Unemployed.

1630
02:19:14,190 --> 02:19:17,182
It hurts like crazy, they say,
but you can have 'em taken off.

1631
02:19:17,293 --> 02:19:20,922
Charity.
Yeah?

1632
02:19:22,531 --> 02:19:26,092
Okay, finished.
Your turn.

1633
02:19:27,870 --> 02:19:31,169
Boy, I'll tell ya,
I didn't care too much
for the first half of my life,

1634
02:19:31,273 --> 02:19:35,471
but the second half
sure is gettin' good.

1635
02:19:43,119 --> 02:19:46,179
Charity, I can't
go through with it.

1636
02:19:49,492 --> 02:19:52,586
Did you hear
what I said, Charity?
I can't marry you.

1637
02:19:57,099 --> 02:19:59,863
You're nervous,
aren't ya, Oscar?

1638
02:19:59,969 --> 02:20:02,267
It's perfectly natural
for the groom to be nervous...

1639
02:20:02,371 --> 02:20:06,330
I can't do it.

1640
02:20:06,442 --> 02:20:09,002
Is this a joke?

1641
02:20:09,111 --> 02:20:11,477
Is this a joke, Oscar?

1642
02:20:11,580 --> 02:20:15,710
'Cause if this is a joke,
it's a very rotten joke.

1643
02:20:15,818 --> 02:20:21,313
Oh, this isn't a joke.
Nobody would joke
about a thing like this.

1644
02:20:21,423 --> 02:20:23,550
Is it a joke?

1645
02:20:28,364 --> 02:20:32,164
I know what it is!
It's this stupid dress!

1646
02:20:32,268 --> 02:20:34,327
Oh, me and
my rotten, crummy taste.

1647
02:20:34,436 --> 02:20:37,462
Why don't we get me
another dress and
this time you pick it out?

1648
02:20:37,573 --> 02:20:41,634
It's not the dress.
It's not the dress.

1649
02:20:41,744 --> 02:20:43,644
It's the way I talk,
isn't it?

1650
02:20:43,746 --> 02:20:47,204
I know, sometimes
I say those dumb things.

1651
02:20:47,316 --> 02:20:49,511
But if I went to night school,
in no time at all...

1652
02:20:49,618 --> 02:20:52,348
Charity, it's not you.
It's me.

1653
02:20:52,454 --> 02:20:56,584
What are you trying to tell me?
I don't know
how to explain it.

1654
02:20:56,692 --> 02:20:59,422
Well, try, Oscar.
Holy mackerel, please try.

1655
02:20:59,528 --> 02:21:02,793
Charity, I have this thing,
this mental block.

1656
02:21:02,898 --> 02:21:06,834
What? So?
There's a lot of that
goin' around.

1657
02:21:06,936 --> 02:21:11,805
A stupid, childish,
insane fixation.
I know it's wrong.

1658
02:21:11,907 --> 02:21:15,809
I know it's not
what a person's done,
i-it's what's inside.

1659
02:21:15,911 --> 02:21:17,811
But I can't help it.

1660
02:21:17,913 --> 02:21:20,780
Did you hear that?
I know it's wrong,
and I can't help it.

1661
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:27,782
I got an idea.

1662
02:21:27,890 --> 02:21:32,384
Let's you and me
go ahead and get married,
and then afterward...

1663
02:21:32,494 --> 02:21:34,962
we'll talk about
your fixation, okay?

1664
02:21:35,064 --> 02:21:37,589
You're better off
without me, Charity.
I'm doing you a favor.

1665
02:21:37,700 --> 02:21:39,600
Oscar. Oscar!

1666
02:21:39,702 --> 02:21:44,139
Oscar! We could be
so happy together.

1667
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:46,367
Growing flowers
in New Jersey.

1668
02:21:46,475 --> 02:21:49,967
On days when your mental
block was botherin' you,
you could stay in bed.

1669
02:21:50,079 --> 02:21:52,843
And I'd grow
the flowers.

1670
02:21:57,286 --> 02:22:00,517
Oscar. Oscar, listen.

1671
02:22:02,591 --> 02:22:05,253
I could change
the way I talk.

1672
02:22:05,361 --> 02:22:08,387
I could change
the way I dress, you know.

1673
02:22:08,497 --> 02:22:13,662
But there's certain things
a person can't change
because they're history.

1674
02:22:13,769 --> 02:22:16,533
And you can't change
history, Oscar, no matter
how much you want to.

1675
02:22:16,639 --> 02:22:20,541
Oh, Charity.

1676
02:22:20,643 --> 02:22:23,737
Oscar, I got so much to give.
Please, let me give it to you.

1677
02:22:23,846 --> 02:22:28,180
Charity, I'm saving you...
I'm saving you from me.

1678
02:22:28,284 --> 02:22:31,185
Don't save me.

1679
02:22:32,288 --> 02:22:34,347
Marry me.

1680
02:22:34,456 --> 02:22:38,984
Don't beg, Charity.
You're too good
to beg to anyone.

1681
02:22:40,729 --> 02:22:45,792
Oscar, hey, you know,
we don't have to get married
if you don't want to.

1682
02:22:45,901 --> 02:22:50,998
I mean, we could just, uh,
you know, be together.

1683
02:22:52,775 --> 02:22:56,768
Don't you understand?
I would destroy you.

1684
02:22:56,879 --> 02:22:59,814
But that's okay.

1685
02:22:59,915 --> 02:23:02,076
I'm not doing much now
anyway.

1686
02:23:02,184 --> 02:23:04,084
Oh, God.

1687
02:23:08,590 --> 02:23:10,751
Forgive me.

1688
02:23:14,296 --> 02:23:18,596
Please forgive me.

1689
02:23:27,142 --> 02:23:29,702
I forgive you.

1690
02:23:29,812 --> 02:23:31,712
I forgive...

1691
02:23:58,507 --> 02:24:03,137
<i>Where am I going
and what will I find</i>

1692
02:24:03,245 --> 02:24:07,705
<i>What's in this grab bag
that I call my mind</i>

1693
02:24:07,816 --> 02:24:11,547
<i>What am I doing
alone on the shelf</i>

1694
02:24:11,653 --> 02:24:13,746
<i>Ain't it a shame</i>

1695
02:24:13,856 --> 02:24:17,986
<i>No one's to blame
but myself</i>

1696
02:24:19,161 --> 02:24:21,686
<i>Which way is clear</i>

1697
02:24:23,866 --> 02:24:27,632
<i>When you've lost your way</i>

1698
02:24:27,736 --> 02:24:31,069
<i>Year after year</i>

1699
02:24:32,408 --> 02:24:34,933
<i>Do I keep falling in love</i>

1700
02:24:35,044 --> 02:24:37,512
<i>For just the kick of it</i>

1701
02:24:37,613 --> 02:24:41,242
<i>Staggering through
the thin and thick of it</i>

1702
02:24:41,350 --> 02:24:45,810
<i>Hating each old
and tired trick of it</i>

1703
02:24:45,921 --> 02:24:49,652
<i>You know what I am
I'm good and sick of it</i>

1704
02:24:49,758 --> 02:24:53,660
<i>Where am I going</i>

1705
02:24:53,762 --> 02:24:58,062
<i>Why do I care</i>

1706
02:24:58,167 --> 02:25:03,161
<i>Run to the Bronx
or Washington Square</i>

1707
02:25:03,272 --> 02:25:06,105
<i>No matter where I run</i>

1708
02:25:06,208 --> 02:25:09,575
<i>I meet myself there</i>

1709
02:25:09,678 --> 02:25:13,341
<i>Looking inside me</i>

1710
02:25:13,449 --> 02:25:17,510
<i>What do I see</i>

1711
02:25:17,619 --> 02:25:20,383
<i>Anger and hope and doubt</i>

1712
02:25:20,489 --> 02:25:24,892
<i>What am I all about
and where am I going</i>

1713
02:25:40,742 --> 02:25:45,179
Yeah? Hey, it's
the old married lady!

1714
02:25:47,749 --> 02:25:50,877
Hi, baby, it's me.
How'd it go?
Nickie.

1715
02:25:50,986 --> 02:25:54,581
What are you doin'
callin' here? You must
have better things to do.

1716
02:25:54,690 --> 02:25:57,250
Nickie, I wanna talk to ya.

1717
02:25:57,359 --> 02:25:59,919
You ought to hear her.
She's all choked up.

1718
02:26:00,028 --> 02:26:02,758
Charity, I can't tell ya
how happy all of us are for ya.

1719
02:26:02,865 --> 02:26:05,493
We've been doin' nothin' else
but talkin' about it all day.

1720
02:26:05,601 --> 02:26:07,967
Tell us about the ceremony.
It must have been beautiful.

1721
02:26:08,070 --> 02:26:10,903
And talk loud
'cause we're all listenin'.
Shh.

1722
02:26:11,006 --> 02:26:14,635
Uh... uh...

1723
02:26:14,743 --> 02:26:16,643
Yeah.

1724
02:26:16,745 --> 02:26:20,237
Yeah, i-it was beautiful.

1725
02:26:20,349 --> 02:26:23,045
It was beautiful
just like in the movies.

1726
02:26:23,152 --> 02:26:25,620
Did he give you a nice ring?
Did he carry you
over the threshold?

1727
02:26:25,721 --> 02:26:28,451
Did he hang out
a "do not disturb" sign?
Shh!

1728
02:26:28,557 --> 02:26:31,856
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah,
he did all those things.

1729
02:26:31,960 --> 02:26:34,451
Just like in the movies,
you know?

1730
02:26:34,563 --> 02:26:37,498
Well, put the groom on.
We wanna hear his side.

1731
02:26:39,601 --> 02:26:44,664
Oh, well, I can't.
He can't, you know.

1732
02:26:44,773 --> 02:26:48,402
We promise we won't
say nothin' dirty.

1733
02:26:48,510 --> 02:26:51,741
We just want to say good luck.
Put him on!
Shh!

1734
02:26:53,982 --> 02:26:56,712
Okay, just a second.

1735
02:26:58,353 --> 02:27:03,416
Honey, uh, the girls wanna
say good luck, you know?

1736
02:27:07,095 --> 02:27:10,997
He says... He says he can't.
He's shaving, you know.

1737
02:27:13,735 --> 02:27:16,670
Are you happy, baby?
Are you finally happy?

1738
02:27:18,607 --> 02:27:20,598
Yeah.

1739
02:27:20,709 --> 02:27:22,700
Yeah, I'm finally happy.

1740
02:27:22,811 --> 02:27:26,338
I hope so. Listen,
don't talk to us no more.

1741
02:27:26,448 --> 02:27:29,076
Any man who's shaving
means business.

1742
02:27:29,184 --> 02:27:31,175
So long, baby,
and thanks for callin'.

1743
02:27:31,286 --> 02:27:33,811
It meant a lot you thinkin'
about us at a time like this.

1744
02:27:33,922 --> 02:27:36,584
Hey, listen,
if the first one's a girl,
you can call it Nickie.

1745
02:27:36,692 --> 02:27:40,059
If it's a boy,
you can call it Nickie.
So long, baby!

1746
02:27:40,162 --> 02:27:44,098
Bye! Bye!

1747
02:27:45,500 --> 02:27:47,866
Bye.

1748
02:27:54,409 --> 02:27:58,175
Looking inside me

1749
02:27:58,280 --> 02:28:01,477
What do I see

1750
02:28:01,583 --> 02:28:05,451
Anger and hope and doubt

1751
02:28:05,554 --> 02:28:07,681
What am I all about

1752
02:28:07,789 --> 02:28:10,952
And where am I going

1753
02:28:13,462 --> 02:28:15,726
You tell me.

1754
02:29:08,350 --> 02:29:10,443
Good morning.
Good morning.

1755
02:29:10,552 --> 02:29:13,316
<i>Good morning.
Good morning.</i>

1756
02:29:17,926 --> 02:29:20,121
Good morning.

1757
02:29:52,728 --> 02:29:54,628
Good morning.

1758
02:29:56,598 --> 02:29:59,362
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1759
02:29:59,468 --> 02:30:01,368
<i>Good morning.</i>

1760
02:30:01,470 --> 02:30:03,438
<i>Good morning.</i>

1761
02:30:11,380 --> 02:30:13,280
Morning.

Love.

1763
02:30:18,553 --> 02:30:20,714
Love.

1764

<i>Love.

Good morning.

Good morning.
