1
00:00:26,606 --> 00:00:30,201
we were returning from Shirdi and
our car broke down on the way...

2
00:00:30,377 --> 00:00:34,370
she is in labour,
can we come in for sometime?

3
00:00:34,548 --> 00:00:37,608
Call them in!
- Please come in!

4
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:55,861
Thank you very much,
will I find a doctor here?

5
00:00:58,638 --> 00:01:00,572
So a baby is expected?
-Yes.

6
00:01:01,174 --> 00:01:02,801
Yourwife is expecting?
-Yes, doctor.

7
00:01:03,176 --> 00:01:05,576
Please hurry up!
-Yes, I am!

8
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:21,191
Congratulations sir, God has given
you a very pretty daughter!

9
00:01:21,328 --> 00:01:23,592
How is Rama?
- She is perfectly alright.

10
00:01:23,697 --> 00:01:25,255
She has just fallen asleep.

11
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:29,193
Here you are!

12
00:01:30,203 --> 00:01:33,195
Great! She was born even before
I could get here.

13
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:36,365
Doctor, please don't get upset
at my daughter's haste.

14
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,602
Thanks for the trouble
you took to come here.

15
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,610
Here is your fees.
-What is the need for this?

16
00:01:43,216 --> 00:01:44,376
Actually I need it!

17
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,618
Aunt Leela, the medicine you gave
me for a cold, really worked.

18
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:55,225
Doctor, you've taken fees to come
here.

19
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,221
Do you also collect to leave?
Okay, I am leaving!

20
00:02:07,774 --> 00:02:09,173
Please take this money.

21
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:14,872
Sir, we may be poor but we can't
accept this. Please keep it back.

22
00:02:15,382 --> 00:02:17,782
Then you tell me,
what can I do for you?

23
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:20,686
Sir, we don't have a child...

24
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:24,851
please pray that
we also get a child...

25
00:02:25,358 --> 00:02:28,657
actually, a child was born
in our house last night...

26
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:32,194
what I mean is that
even my wife should...

27
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:35,867
He has understood!
-Yes, I will surely pray for you.

28
00:02:36,603 --> 00:02:42,200
You'll have done us a big favor,
if we would get twin daughters...

29
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:44,806
then I would surely give you
one of my daughters.

30
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:48,810
Okay, good bye!
- Good bye, sir.

31
00:02:58,225 --> 00:02:59,817
Listen, come here...

32
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:09,766
Why did you do this?
- They really did get twin daughters.

33
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,161
So you hid one of them?
- So what?

34
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:14,767
What would they do with
two identical daughters?

35
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:18,611
Didn't he say that if they would
get twins, he'd give us one!

36
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,875
He said it that doesn't mean he'd
do it, even I say a lot of things!

37
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:33,615
Why didn't you think how we'll
raise a child from a rich family?

38
00:03:35,262 --> 00:03:42,191
We'll give her the love that is
rarely found in the rich families!

39
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:52,752
Grandmother, your
cough has increased.

40
00:06:53,526 --> 00:06:57,519
Yes child but yet, I don't die!

41
00:06:58,264 --> 00:07:00,198
Grandmother, have this medicine.

42
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:13,141
I am losing my eyesight too!

43
00:07:14,314 --> 00:07:18,717
But I don't mind because,
I cannot see...

44
00:07:19,152 --> 00:07:21,518
the torture that is meted
out on you.

45
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:24,654
Wretched girl!

46
00:07:25,592 --> 00:07:29,722
Even the servants are not
called like this!

47
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:32,154
You go, child.
- But grandmother...

48
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:36,162
Are you dead?
- Go child, don't bother about me.

49
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:46,634
Yes, aunty.

50
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:50,874
I've been calling you since past
two hours. Couldn't you hear me?

51
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:55,849
Aunty, grandmother...
- Damn that old woman!

52
00:07:56,256 --> 00:07:57,848
We'll be relieved if she dies!

53
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:00,853
I feel like conducting her
final rites when she is alive!

54
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:07,459
Stop staring! Will you get me hot
water or will your ancestors get it?

55
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,734
I'll get it.

56
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,130
Will your legs break
if you walk faster?

57
00:08:37,163 --> 00:08:39,757
I've not seen
a bigger idiot than you!

58
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:43,158
It's time for my college and
you've not yet ironed my sari?

59
00:08:43,503 --> 00:08:45,664
I'll do it, Sheila.
- Hurry up, stupid!

60
00:08:58,184 --> 00:08:59,845
Did you get the soap?
- I'll get it.

61
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:04,350
Wonderwhy she is with us!

62
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:07,592
She will never do anything
unless you don't tell her.

63
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:12,193
Why don't you tell her anything?

64
00:09:12,465 --> 00:09:14,399
Wait a minute!

65
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:17,692
And what are you doing there?

66
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:21,799
I was just polishing my shoes!

67
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:26,211
Have you worked all your life
that today you are doing this?

68
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:28,475
Hey, wretched girl!
Polish these shoes.

69
00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:30,806
But...
- Give it to her.

70
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:32,545
Giving!

71
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,652
Here, child.
- Polish them quickly.

72
00:09:37,323 --> 00:09:39,814
Why did you ask her to do it, the
poor girl does many other things.

73
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:43,753
Do you ever see how much
she eats the whole day?

74
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,755
If she does some exercise,
her fat will burn out!

75
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:50,794
She gets hot water for you everyday,
why don't you repair the geyser?

76
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:54,966
I'll do that only when the lawyer
will get this month's allowance.

77
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:58,840
Didn't Seeta's father trust
you even a bit...

78
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:02,180
why did he entrust the entire
property to the lawyers before dying?

79
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:05,176
This bungalow is also in Seeta's
name and what do we get?

80
00:10:05,518 --> 00:10:07,452
All we get is
Rs. 5,000/- per month.

81
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,611
That too we'll get only till
Seeta gets married.

82
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:11,481
Her marriage!

83
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:16,719
It's a chiffon sari,
do you know how expensive it is?

84
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:19,197
Be careful while ironing it.

85
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:27,195
What is it?
- Sir, your tea.

86
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,198
Old man, who asked you
to get tea for me?

87
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:34,676
Where is that pretty girl?

88
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:39,775
You mean Seeta, she is
attending to Madam's chores.

89
00:10:40,653 --> 00:10:43,781
ldiot, anybody can attend
to sister's chores...

90
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:46,623
ask her to attend to me,
give me a match!

91
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:54,890
Listen, I don't want to see
your mug from tomorrow morning.

92
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:56,825
Get out now!

93
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:59,803
Sister, can l
polish father's shoes?

94
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:01,968
No Babloo, I will do it,
give it here!

95
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:06,837
No, while you iron this sari,
I'll polish these shoes.

96
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,672
Both the jobs will be done soon!
-And what if your mother sees?

97
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:12,407
She'll scold me.

98
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:14,850
And if you are late,
she will yet scold you!

99
00:11:15,188 --> 00:11:18,851
Alright, do it but
don't dirty your hands.

100
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:23,526
Seeta, are you going to get the
soap or shall I come and hit you?

101
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:26,730
Oh my, I forgot!
I'll get it, aunty!

102
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:36,698
What took you so long
to get a bar of soap?

103
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,871
Get out from here!

104
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:47,886
Yes.
- Please come here.

105
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:53,625
I have a lot of work.
-Will you stand there and talk to me?

106
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,497
I won't eat you up, why don't you
do things for me too?

107
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:06,336
Will you do it?
-What do you want me to do?

108
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,166
You are very simple! Okay,
can you stitch up this button?

109
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:13,768
You keep it aside,
I'll do it in the afternoon.

110
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,171
It will take two minutes, do it now.

111
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,441
Here is the needle and
thread and the button too!

112
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:29,193
I mean it, Seeta. I feel very sorry
to see you in this state.

113
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:34,463
But you are to be blamed for this,
just trust me once...

114
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:38,794
nobody will tell you a word but
you think that I am your enemy!

115
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:43,942
Look what she has done!
-What happened?

116
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:49,875
Coming!
- Sheila, please forgive me.

117
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:53,775
What happened, child?

118
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,678
Aunty, I am extremely sorry, there
were too many things at a time...

119
00:12:58,024 --> 00:13:01,482
Liar! Mother, she burnt my sari!

120
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:04,830
You louse! How dare you?

121
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:08,757
It happened by mistake.
- It was by mistake...

122
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:10,926
or you did it purposely?
You are jealous of my daughter!

123
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:14,165
Why would I be jealous ofher?
- How dare you argue?

124
00:13:15,174 --> 00:13:17,540
I will skin your hide!
-Aunty!

125
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:19,835
Don't beat her!
- Forgive me, aunty.

126
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:24,181
I will kill you today!
Stop interfering, move away!

127
00:13:33,993 --> 00:13:37,690
Get inside! Only when you'll be
locked in here, will you realize.

128
00:13:38,197 --> 00:13:41,189
Only when you'll not be fed for
4-5 days you'll value things.

129
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:46,194
You keep quiet, you've spoilt her!

130
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:06,317
Mother, father,
why did you'll leave me?

131
00:14:08,828 --> 00:14:11,490
Nobody loves me here!

132
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:19,328
Mother, I would like to come to you!

133
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:36,519
Listen to me, for how long
will you order food from outside?

134
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:39,620
Please let Seeta out.
- Stop siding her!

135
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,517
I just suggested.

136
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:43,788
She has become too big for her
boots.

137
00:14:44,197 --> 00:14:46,722
Two days if she is inside,
she'll get back into her senses!

138
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,760
That's okay but...
- But what?

139
00:14:50,203 --> 00:14:51,397
Nothing!

140
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:54,296
Mother, the laundry man hasn't
got my blue sari yet.

141
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,533
I've to go to college.
- Do you have dearth of saris?

142
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:02,143
I promised my friends that
I would wear a blue sari today.

143
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:06,575
That laundry man is very mean!
- I am a little surprised, child.

144
00:15:07,153 --> 00:15:11,613
Do you go to college to study or
display your sari to your friends?

145
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,858
Shut up, you are
always taunting her!

146
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:19,164
This is the age to flaunt things.
Child, you sit at home today.

147
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:24,830
I've to pay my college fees today.
- Fees??

148
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:31,644
Is it the 1st today?
- I think so!

149
00:15:32,178 --> 00:15:36,171
Then the lawyer will come today.
- If it's the 1st, he'll surely come.

150
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:38,946
Please come in, Mr. Gupta.

151
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:42,852
What is the matter,
you don't look alright.

152
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:44,884
Nothing much, I've got cold,
you please sit!

153
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:48,456
You should have called a doctor.
- Ramu, get tea and snacks quickly!

154
00:15:48,628 --> 00:15:50,619
Hello!
- Hello!

155
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:54,626
There is no need to call for
anything. I am in a hurry, please call Seeta.

156
00:15:54,967 --> 00:16:00,564
You come here as ifit's a duty.
-Well, it is a duty.

157
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,132
Your brother made me the trustee
ofhis entire wealth.

158
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:08,478
But the responsibility of such
a vast wealth is not at all easy.

159
00:16:08,814 --> 00:16:11,647
Mr. Gupta, you have not
seen our responsibility.

160
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:15,143
We have raised this orphan girl
as our own child.

161
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:20,152
We always have the fear that people
may criticize our upbringing.

162
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:23,758
You do take care ofher!
- But yet, I live under that fear.

163
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:25,892
I don't want to lack anything
in my responsibility.

164
00:16:26,232 --> 00:16:29,668
I suggest that you get her married.

165
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:32,831
Your responsibility will end
and so will mine!

166
00:16:33,272 --> 00:16:38,175
As per brother's will, our
responsibly is till her marriage.

167
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:40,602
Have you'll seen
any suitable boy for her?

168
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,644
We've seen dozens of them!

169
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:49,678
But I feel that not a single one
is suitable for our Seeta.

170
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:53,590
Mr. Gupta, why don't you
suggest some good proposal?

171
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:57,192
Isn't it, Kaushalya?
-Yes, even we will keep looking!

172
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,691
Yes, I will look out.

173
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:02,134
Come, child!

174
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:04,602
Why did you get it, you should have
asked the servant to get it.

175
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:08,567
I'll make the tea. She loves
doing household chores.

176
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:14,135
Even if I stop her, she keeps
doing something or the other!

177
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:18,480
That's very nice, girls must be
well versed with domestic chores.

178
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:22,480
How are you, child?
-Yes, thank you.

179
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,494
Child, this is your
monthly allowance.

180
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:33,154
Take it!
- Count it!

181
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:35,763
What is the need for that,
it must be exact!

182
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:41,606
I will be convinced.
- Child, give the money to your uncle.

183
00:17:43,976 --> 00:17:45,967
Here, take your tea.
- Thank you.

184
00:17:55,187 --> 00:17:57,178
It's exact, Mr. Gupta.
- It had to be!

185
00:17:57,523 --> 00:17:59,514
He was just joking about it!

186
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:02,694
Don't give me, give it
to the person it belongs to.

187
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:06,788
Alright Mr. Badrinath,
permit me to leave.

188
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:11,797
Have some more tea.
- Let him leave, he is a busy man!

189
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:15,135
She's right, I am in a hurry.
Good bye!

190
00:18:21,814 --> 00:18:24,544
What are you doing here?
Come on, take this tray inside.

191
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:33,719
You seem to be in a great hurry
to get your niece married.

192
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:40,495
Don't you know the day she gets
married, you'll be out on the street!

193
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:45,501
That's right but...
- Damn you and your buts!!

194
00:18:45,838 --> 00:18:47,829
That too is right!

195
00:18:53,212 --> 00:18:56,511
Yes, grandmother.
- Come here, child.

196
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,181
Sit close to me.

197
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:13,888
You are looking very beautiful.

198
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:17,565
You look like a princess!

199
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:24,869
You mark my words, one day a
prince in a shining armor will come...

200
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:31,206
and will sweep away my princess
and take her to his kingdom!

201
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:38,723
These are mere fairy tales,
no prince will ever come!

202
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:42,558
He will, my child. I have
a strong feeling that he will come!

203
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,222
Grandmother, you are very nice!

204
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,238
Grandmother, I am going!

205
00:19:57,243 --> 00:19:58,232
Aunty, you called.

206
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,676
Yes, why are you yet
dressed like this?

207
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:08,177
Remove the jewellery and this sari!
Don't you feel like taking them out?

208
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:11,522
Give it soon and
what about this sari?

209
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:16,855
I'll go in my room and take it out.
-Why there? Take it out here!

210
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:24,798
Stop this act of a chastity,
shameless girl!!

211
00:20:25,437 --> 00:20:29,203
Take it out and
go and cook the food!

212
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:32,803
Aunty, how can l...
-What do you mean?

213
00:20:33,312 --> 00:20:35,212
Are you going or shall I hit you?

214
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,354
Oh! So my sister did manage
to take out your clothes?

215
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:47,881
Why have you left the rest,
do they belong to you?

216
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:53,555
What is it, old man?
-You had asked for cigarettes.

217
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:55,890
Throw them for all I care!

218
00:20:56,235 --> 00:21:01,605
Grandmother!!
- Stop crying, my child!!

219
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:06,702
Why can't I die?
- Don't say that, my child!

220
00:21:08,514 --> 00:21:11,574
Grandmother...
- Don't say a word, child.

221
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:13,875
I understand your tears!

222
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:22,523
God, isn't there anybody in this
world who can save her from them?

223
00:21:59,398 --> 00:22:03,494
''Life's a game,
some win, some lose...''

224
00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:08,168
''there are experts,
and there are novices''

225
00:22:10,442 --> 00:22:14,742
''Do you get it, mister...?
Or perhaps you, fatso?''

226
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:19,181
''There are experts
and there are novices''

227
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,187
''Life's a game.
Some win, some lose...''

228
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,854
''there are experts,
and there are novices''

229
00:22:30,996 --> 00:22:35,729
''Do you get it mister...?
Or maybe you have?

230
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:20,240
''Cut the nonsense.
Get to work, Raka''

231
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:25,714
''Oh yes, it's work that
will bring you fame''

232
00:23:35,194 --> 00:23:39,790
''You're like a bird in flight,
I swear by you''

233
00:23:40,265 --> 00:23:43,723
''Don't you fall...
watch your step''

234
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:48,663
''Get that, mister...?
Or perhaps you, sister?''

235
00:24:34,953 --> 00:24:36,944
''Step back, children...
- Sit down''

236
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:40,452
''Turn around, snobbish one''

237
00:24:41,727 --> 00:24:44,457
''And people will give you
a round of applause''

238
00:24:44,696 --> 00:24:46,186
''Applause!''

239
00:24:55,874 --> 00:25:00,208
''A true spectacle
I will show them...''

240
00:25:00,445 --> 00:25:03,676
''every heart, I will send pounding''

241
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:08,643
''Get that, sardarji?
Get it, lady?''

242
00:25:09,154 --> 00:25:13,147
''There are experts
and there are novices''

243
00:25:18,263 --> 00:25:22,324
''Life's a game.
Some win, some lose.

244
00:25:22,668 --> 00:25:26,934
''There are experts
and there are novices''

245
00:25:29,408 --> 00:25:33,606
''Got it, mister?
- Or you, Pathan?''

246
00:25:57,002 --> 00:25:58,799
Damn it!
-What is the matter, chief?.

247
00:25:59,204 --> 00:26:01,138
Nothing Cheena,
it's just my bad luck.

248
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:05,137
I bet on the wrong number.
- But you were given a right tip!

249
00:26:05,644 --> 00:26:08,135
I saw number six last night
in my dream and I bet on that number.

250
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,380
And now I've lost the money!

251
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,845
What do you think will be the
number today?

252
00:26:14,152 --> 00:26:15,642
Ace!

253
00:26:16,154 --> 00:26:17,815
Are you sure?
-Yes, I am!

254
00:26:18,156 --> 00:26:20,488
I've neverwon the way you do!

255
00:26:21,226 --> 00:26:26,493
Come on, take your share.
- Geeta, you've made an equal share.

256
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:29,495
Raka, you can play five times today.

257
00:26:29,768 --> 00:26:33,169
What about the notes
that are under yourfeet?

258
00:26:33,505 --> 00:26:34,836
What do you mean?

259
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,231
Move your leg and
give me that money!

260
00:26:38,176 --> 00:26:43,170
Oh, these? Don't shout,
I did not hide them purposely.

261
00:26:43,582 --> 00:26:49,748
You do it everyday but when I get
angry, you'll realise it!

262
00:26:50,188 --> 00:26:55,524
Just try doing that,
don't forget my name is Geeta!

263
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:58,659
Even my name is Raka,
I'll break your legs!

264
00:26:58,997 --> 00:27:01,124
What did you say?
Do you think you are a don?

265
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,125
How dare you show me that knife?
- Leave her, chief!

266
00:27:05,137 --> 00:27:08,573
You steal and then you show
this knife? Apologize to him!

267
00:27:09,141 --> 00:27:13,475
I don't want to work with her, does
she think we cannot do without her?

268
00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:18,139
No, the public throws money when
you show your juggling tricks!

269
00:27:22,254 --> 00:27:26,554
Such things happen chief,
why make it a big issue?

270
00:27:26,892 --> 00:27:28,883
Nonsense! How could she
threaten me?

271
00:27:29,261 --> 00:27:31,752
It was just a knife!

272
00:27:32,264 --> 00:27:36,166
Go to your room and rest.
-You don't side her!

273
00:27:41,173 --> 00:27:44,165
You are back, Geeta.
- Mother, I am very hungry.

274
00:27:44,343 --> 00:27:47,506
You will drop the tray,
come with me to the temple.

275
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:49,770
You go there, I'll go home
and eat something.

276
00:27:50,182 --> 00:27:53,515
I haven't cooked,
I'll come back and make something.

277
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:57,187
I'll be famished by then!
- It doesn't take long to cook.

278
00:27:57,622 --> 00:27:59,681
I'll be back soon.
- I'll knead the dough meanwhile.

279
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:03,521
No, you please don't touch
anything in the kitchen.

280
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:05,821
I'll come back soon.

281
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:11,127
Geeta, why are you straining
your eyes in the night?

282
00:28:14,172 --> 00:28:18,131
Cheena told me that today,
you fought with Raka again.

283
00:28:19,144 --> 00:28:23,547
We do it everyday but actually,
it was my fault.

284
00:28:24,282 --> 00:28:28,150
Stop fighting with the poor boy,
think of your future.

285
00:28:28,687 --> 00:28:32,555
I may not live long,
I suggest you hold his hand.

286
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,253
But why should I hold Raka's hand?

287
00:28:37,696 --> 00:28:41,154
You fool, I am talking
about your marriage!

288
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:46,631
You mean with Raka?
-Why, what does he lack?

289
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:49,930
He may be a little hot tempered
but he has a clear heart!

290
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:53,169
Mother, you are getting senile!

291
00:28:53,478 --> 00:28:56,413
Yes, I have!
It's a sin to talk to you.

292
00:28:58,183 --> 00:29:01,175
What is it?
- The bride groom is coming!

293
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:27,736
Did you see, he is a drunkard,
can I marry such a man?

294
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,976
No, a prince will come here
to marry you.

295
00:29:31,483 --> 00:29:36,216
Yes, a prince in a shining armor
will come to marry me.

296
00:29:41,927 --> 00:29:44,225
Have you seen this stick,
how light it!

297
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:49,489
Along with a medical degree from
London, I've got this golf stick too!

298
00:29:51,803 --> 00:29:59,574
I've seen that men often get a
foreign wife when they go abroad.

299
00:30:01,847 --> 00:30:03,747
That is their problem!

300
00:30:04,216 --> 00:30:06,844
I don't say that women
out there are not good...

301
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:14,720
there's a big difference in our
culture & marriage is impossible!

302
00:30:18,396 --> 00:30:21,763
What is your image of an ideal wife?

303
00:30:23,268 --> 00:30:27,204
A sari clad girl, who cooks well...

304
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:29,530
a very simple, Indian woman!

305
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:34,211
He'll surely like her, Seeta is the
kind of girl Dr. Ravi is looking for!

306
00:30:34,546 --> 00:30:37,538
What kind of girl does
that damn doctorwant?

307
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:42,744
A very simple Indian girl,
just like our Seeta.

308
00:30:43,221 --> 00:30:48,215
Is that so?

309
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,168
Come, child.

310
00:31:08,313 --> 00:31:12,511
God bless you! Is she the one?
- No, she is my daughter, Sheila.

311
00:31:13,185 --> 00:31:14,777
She is doing her B.A.

312
00:31:15,187 --> 00:31:18,850
Mother, can I get some tea or
coffee? -No child, Ramu will get it.

313
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:21,317
She is very fond of
doing domestic chores.

314
00:31:21,526 --> 00:31:24,518
She doesn't have any habits
of a modern girl.

315
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,862
Child, why didn't you
get Seeta along?

316
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,734
She's in her room...
- I'll go and get her.

317
00:31:31,203 --> 00:31:33,194
You talk to aunty,
I'll be right back!

318
00:31:35,207 --> 00:31:38,540
Ramu, how does the boy look?

319
00:31:39,211 --> 00:31:41,805
You must have seen him.
- He looks very decent.

320
00:31:42,314 --> 00:31:47,342
He'll make a good husband for
Seeta. - Listen, what is his name?

321
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:53,218
Ravi, why are you so quiet?
-What should I say?

322
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:58,552
Talk as much as you want, after
your marriage, you won't get that chance!

323
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:00,823
Isn't it, Mr. Badrinath?

324
00:32:21,253 --> 00:32:23,778
Walk down or I will...
-Aunty!!

325
00:32:47,212 --> 00:32:48,804
Sit here, child!

326
00:32:56,021 --> 00:32:57,488
Sit down!

327
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:18,502
Is she Seeta?
-Yes!

328
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,171
Mr. Gupta told us something else!

329
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:26,713
He speaks about the 18 century...

330
00:33:27,185 --> 00:33:30,518
if these girls will not be
fashionable then will we be?

331
00:33:30,855 --> 00:33:34,188
Besides, this is the age
of progress, isn't it Ravi?

332
00:33:36,261 --> 00:33:41,699
Right, I think our country has
progressed more than the west!

333
00:33:43,201 --> 00:33:47,194
They would like to have tea
made by you, go get it.

334
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,529
Go!!

335
00:33:56,581 --> 00:33:58,572
Ramu, give the tray to Seeta.

336
00:34:24,576 --> 00:34:27,170
How did you fall,
what is the matter?

337
00:34:28,613 --> 00:34:31,776
Did you hurt yourself?. I am sorry,
your clothes are stained.

338
00:34:32,183 --> 00:34:33,582
Let's leave, son!

339
00:34:34,185 --> 00:34:39,589
Please don't leave.
- No, it's quite late.

340
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:42,189
We'll come some other time,
let's go Ravi.

341
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:44,726
But Mr. Chaudhary...
- Let's go!

342
00:34:45,997 --> 00:34:53,199
Please wait Mr. Chaudhary,
please listen to me...

343
00:34:56,541 --> 00:35:00,204
Please don't insult us and go.

344
00:35:01,146 --> 00:35:06,311
I assure you that you what you are
seeing is absolutely wrong!

345
00:35:07,152 --> 00:35:10,815
My Seeta is not like that, she
will serve you whole heartedly.

346
00:35:12,157 --> 00:35:17,561
For God's sake, please stop.
-What can I do?

347
00:35:18,163 --> 00:35:20,654
Ravi, please accept this proposal.

348
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:26,899
Well, l...
- I plead to you, son.

349
00:35:27,305 --> 00:35:30,832
No grandmother, please stop it!

350
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:02,131
Kaushalya, whatever you are doing
is not right!

351
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,643
You?!
-Who else could it be?

352
00:37:16,614 --> 00:37:21,745
I am the only one who writhes
in pain when I see your sorrows!

353
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,584
But don't worry, if not Ravi,
I am still there!

354
00:37:25,924 --> 00:37:27,915
You can find better boys!

355
00:37:28,927 --> 00:37:31,521
Ranjit, you please go from here.

356
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:37,597
You are great! You want to
mourn for a stranger...

357
00:37:38,603 --> 00:37:42,266
and the ones who are crazy about
you, you don't even look at them!

358
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:46,743
You please go or else...
- Or else what?

359
00:37:47,178 --> 00:37:50,614
I will scream.
- If you scream you will be defamed.

360
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:54,174
Please go away!
- Scream, I will not go!!

361
00:37:54,852 --> 00:37:56,376
Grandmother!

362
00:37:59,524 --> 00:38:00,456
Uncle!

363
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,791
What happened?

364
00:38:22,847 --> 00:38:25,611
Tell me, where is my wallet, thief?.

365
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,141
Where is the thief?.
- In front of you!

366
00:38:28,586 --> 00:38:30,144
Aunty, he is lying.

367
00:38:30,288 --> 00:38:32,153
Shut up! Talk when I ask you to talk!

368
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,815
What is the matter, Ranjit?
- She cleaned my room today.

369
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:37,150
After that my wallet was missing,
who else could have taken it?

370
00:38:37,295 --> 00:38:40,287
You wretched, horrible girl,
you've started stealing too?

371
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:45,602
Uncle, I have not stolen anything.

372
00:38:46,437 --> 00:38:52,433
You can search my room.
-Yes, you can check her room.

373
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:55,244
Yes sister, let's both
search her room.

374
00:39:11,195 --> 00:39:12,856
Here it is!

375
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:20,398
Detestable girl! You steal and
then you make false promises!

376
00:39:21,205 --> 00:39:26,541
Sister, you move away, your
thrashing will not affect her.

377
00:39:30,214 --> 00:39:32,546
You thief! I will skin your hide!

378
00:39:38,222 --> 00:39:40,554
Someone please save her!

379
00:39:44,762 --> 00:39:46,753
Please don't hit her!

380
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,893
For God's sake, please stop!

381
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,706
Stop, Ranjit!!

382
00:39:58,042 --> 00:40:01,170
Grandmother, please save me!

383
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,671
This old woman will save you?

384
00:40:05,183 --> 00:40:11,179
Grandmother, please save me!
- Ranjit, let her go, I plead to you.

385
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,784
Then tell her to stay
within her limits...

386
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:17,591
or else I will skin her hide!

387
00:40:24,202 --> 00:40:28,195
Grandmother!
- Stop crying, child!

388
00:41:01,873 --> 00:41:03,773
Where are you?

389
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:06,166
Oh! You are here!

390
00:41:06,577 --> 00:41:08,772
What happened?
-Ask what did not happen?

391
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,171
Do you know what your niece has
done?

392
00:41:11,616 --> 00:41:16,246
What did she do now?
-What can she do, she has run away!

393
00:41:20,191 --> 00:41:22,182
Seeta has run away?!
- Oh God, what will we do now?

394
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,552
What will we tell people,
we have been defamed!

395
00:41:25,863 --> 00:41:27,854
You are more concerned
about the allowance.

396
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:30,798
The way you'll were behaving
with her, she had to run away!

397
00:41:31,202 --> 00:41:33,693
Will you just lecture me
or even do something?

398
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:37,538
We should do something
but what should I do?

399
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:41,709
Look for her, report
the matter to the police.

400
00:41:42,213 --> 00:41:45,546
That's right!
- Leave this now!

401
00:41:46,217 --> 00:41:48,811
I did not like her
behaviour these days.

402
00:41:49,353 --> 00:41:51,753
She was acting too big
for her shoes!

403
00:41:52,223 --> 00:41:55,886
Why Ranjit had to go to Delhi this
morning? Did you get the number?

404
00:42:00,498 --> 00:42:08,166
I am Badrinath speaking.
Actually, my niece...

405
00:42:08,673 --> 00:42:16,170
Seeta, has left the house!

406
00:42:17,181 --> 00:42:19,172
And we are very worried about her.

407
00:42:20,184 --> 00:42:22,175
What, why did she go away?

408
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:29,182
Actually, her mental state is...

409
00:42:30,595 --> 00:42:33,530
You come to the police station,
I'll write down your report.

410
00:42:33,931 --> 00:42:35,922
And yes, do get her photograph.

411
00:42:40,538 --> 00:42:43,371
What will we do if we don't find her?

412
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:46,299
That wretched Gupta will not
give us a penny!

413
00:42:47,812 --> 00:42:50,645
O God, please have mercy on us!

414
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,718
Aunty, what have you cooked
today?

415
00:42:59,223 --> 00:43:02,659
The stove has become cold but
I wonder where Geeta is!

416
00:43:03,194 --> 00:43:05,662
I wonder if she has gone to buy
vegetables or grow them!

417
00:43:06,264 --> 00:43:11,566
She has gone to buy vegetables! In
that case you observe a fast today.

418
00:43:12,169 --> 00:43:14,569
She is playing marbles
with the children of the area.

419
00:43:15,306 --> 00:43:19,709
What, I have been waiting for her
and she's playing marbles?

420
00:43:20,278 --> 00:43:22,838
Are you saying the truth?
- I've seen it with my own eyes!

421
00:43:23,648 --> 00:43:28,176
Don't mind but it doesn't look good
if a young girl plays with marbles.

422
00:43:28,552 --> 00:43:30,315
I will go and break her bones!

423
00:43:30,521 --> 00:43:34,184
Aunty!
- Give it to me!

424
00:43:41,198 --> 00:43:43,462
Her marbles are very lucky,
she always wins!

425
00:43:43,634 --> 00:43:45,625
Are your marbles over?

426
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:48,530
Here, play with them.
- Give it to me!

427
00:43:52,643 --> 00:43:54,873
Now tell me which one should I aim?
- The green one!

428
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,471
You are cheating,
you're crossing the line!

429
00:43:58,716 --> 00:44:01,150
What did you say?

430
00:44:01,485 --> 00:44:05,148
Don't waste time, hurry up!
- I get angry if someone provokes me!

431
00:44:05,489 --> 00:44:07,480
Shall I aim the green one?
-Yes.

432
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,490
What are you doing here?
- I was just playing!

433
00:44:14,165 --> 00:44:17,760
You've been missing
since past 2 hours.

434
00:44:18,169 --> 00:44:19,500
Why are you hitting me?

435
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:22,605
Do you want me to love you
because, you've made me happy?

436
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,671
Good that Raka told me you were
here! - Oh! So he told you?

437
00:44:27,178 --> 00:44:31,512
I will not spare you, you creep!
-Wild cat!!

438
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:34,180
You are wild cat!!

439
00:44:44,528 --> 00:44:46,860
What do you think of yourself?.
You Keep beating me every now and then

440
00:44:47,198 --> 00:44:48,756
I'll run away from home.

441
00:44:48,866 --> 00:44:51,528
I will not look for you!
Raka, go get her!

442
00:44:57,508 --> 00:45:00,909
Aunty, she has gone, what will
we do about ourwork now?

443
00:45:01,545 --> 00:45:05,140
Why you had to hit her,
she was just playing with marbles!

444
00:45:05,549 --> 00:45:07,540
Should you hit with a stick,
look at her!

445
00:45:20,564 --> 00:45:22,725
You are so big and
yet you are crying?

446
00:45:24,168 --> 00:45:26,636
What is the matter,
did someone hit you?

447
00:45:27,238 --> 00:45:32,175
Why don't you say?
- That man took my school fees!

448
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:35,741
Oh! You have lost
your school fees in gambling?

449
00:45:36,514 --> 00:45:40,177
Why did you play?
Alright, come with me!

450
00:45:40,651 --> 00:45:43,176
Come on, bet your money!
Bet on your cards!

451
00:45:48,192 --> 00:45:53,186
Talk to me, aren't you
ashamed to dupe a child?

452
00:45:53,531 --> 00:45:55,522
I've not duped him, he has
lost that money in gambling.

453
00:45:55,733 --> 00:45:58,201
It's as good as duping,
come on, give his money back!

454
00:45:58,469 --> 00:46:02,132
What if I don't?
- I'll drag you to the police station.

455
00:46:02,306 --> 00:46:04,797
I am not scared, let me see who
has the guts to take me there!

456
00:46:05,209 --> 00:46:07,643
I can take your father there too!

457
00:46:08,813 --> 00:46:10,804
I can deal very well with
people like you.

458
00:46:11,148 --> 00:46:13,708
Stop pushing me!
- Confess in front ofhim.

459
00:46:14,251 --> 00:46:17,482
Sir, he has a gambling
den in our area.

460
00:46:17,922 --> 00:46:20,152
He even looted this poor boy's
school fees.

461
00:46:20,491 --> 00:46:24,723
What nonsense are you talking?
- Raghu, you've started again?

462
00:46:25,162 --> 00:46:28,563
I was broke, sir.
- How much money did you play for?

463
00:46:29,467 --> 00:46:33,335
Put him in the cell and take out
Rs. 20/- and give it to this child.

464
00:46:33,771 --> 00:46:37,764
If you gamble next time then
I will lock you up too!

465
00:46:38,209 --> 00:46:41,178
Out you go now and you...

466
00:46:50,187 --> 00:46:52,178
you come with me,
I want your statement!

467
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:55,653
My statement!
- Tukaram, get me a glass of water.

468
00:46:56,193 --> 00:47:00,186
I'll give my statement but I won't
get involved in court matters.

469
00:47:00,598 --> 00:47:03,123
After all, I am
a service class girl.

470
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:13,600
It's strange that you've come here.

471
00:47:14,478 --> 00:47:16,708
I am a very bold person.
I can go anywhere.

472
00:47:16,881 --> 00:47:19,213
Hello, is that Mr. Badrinath?

473
00:47:20,151 --> 00:47:22,483
We have found her, she is here.

474
00:47:23,154 --> 00:47:26,146
You come here quickly
within 5 minutes.

475
00:47:32,229 --> 00:47:36,757
Sir, my statement?
- I'll just have it typed.

476
00:47:37,501 --> 00:47:40,334
But tell me, why did
you go away from home?

477
00:47:40,638 --> 00:47:44,165
Actually sir, I don't like
this everyday hassle!

478
00:47:44,508 --> 00:47:46,499
That is why I left home,
now let them look for me!

479
00:47:46,844 --> 00:47:51,178
Never mind, I've called them up,
they must be on theirway.

480
00:47:51,415 --> 00:47:53,406
Who they?
-Your uncle and aunt!

481
00:47:53,651 --> 00:47:57,451
Who did you say?
-Your uncle and aunt!

482
00:47:57,721 --> 00:47:59,951
I don't have an uncle nor an aunt!

483
00:48:00,457 --> 00:48:04,450
That's bad, such small fights
cannot sever relationships!

484
00:48:04,828 --> 00:48:11,131
Don't say that, Seeta!
- Seeta?! What confusion is this?

485
00:48:11,569 --> 00:48:15,130
My name is Geeta and
I am leaving, good bye!

486
00:48:15,372 --> 00:48:17,670
Catch her, don't let her run!!

487
00:48:51,175 --> 00:48:53,166
Open the door quickly!

488
00:48:55,946 --> 00:48:57,777
What is this?

489
00:49:07,191 --> 00:49:09,182
Inspector, where is
our niece, Seeta?

490
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,724
Tell us soon, where is she?

491
00:49:13,497 --> 00:49:17,194
Oh, my!
- See it for yourself!

492
00:49:22,306 --> 00:49:26,208
Come down, child!
-You come up, fatso!

493
00:49:28,212 --> 00:49:31,204
I think she has
actually become mad!

494
00:49:32,216 --> 00:49:36,380
Seeta my child, we are
your uncle and aunt!

495
00:49:36,754 --> 00:49:39,222
You look like a pair of
cartoons to me!

496
00:49:41,225 --> 00:49:47,221
We've come to take you home.
-Am I your father's property?

497
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:54,567
Look, if you don't come down
then I'll put on the fan!

498
00:49:54,772 --> 00:49:59,232
Don't do that, I will come down!

499
00:50:05,182 --> 00:50:08,379
Uncle!...Aunty!!...

500
00:50:11,188 --> 00:50:13,179
Which oil do you use?
-What?

501
00:50:13,557 --> 00:50:19,189
Can we take her home?
- Please do that!

502
00:50:19,596 --> 00:50:21,188
Let's go now!
- Stop screaming.

503
00:50:21,332 --> 00:50:23,698
Thank you very much, inspector.

504
00:50:36,013 --> 00:50:38,709
Thank you very much!
-Will you come along now?

505
00:50:44,221 --> 00:50:45,483
Sit down!

506
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,558
This car is really very good!

507
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:06,605
Uncle, where are we going?

508
00:51:07,311 --> 00:51:10,178
We are going home.
- Home?! Whose house?

509
00:51:10,514 --> 00:51:16,180
You'll know it in sometime, I'll
thrash you on reaching home!

510
00:51:16,553 --> 00:51:18,680
Why do you keep nudging me, fatso?
-What?

511
00:51:19,189 --> 00:51:22,181
I lovingly told you, fatso!

512
00:51:22,393 --> 00:51:24,190
Did you hear that?
- Forget it, she's a child.

513
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:27,558
I'll cut off your tongue,
did you understand?

514
00:51:27,898 --> 00:51:30,628
What nonsense is this, at the police
station you were calling me child...

515
00:51:31,201 --> 00:51:33,192
and here you are...
- Shut up!

516
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:44,544
Oh! She's there, stop the car!!

517
00:51:45,215 --> 00:51:47,547
Go after her and catch her!

518
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:53,212
She's is our daughter and she's mad,
we were taking her to the asylum...

519
00:51:53,557 --> 00:51:56,219
and now she has run away,
please help us to catch her!

520
00:51:56,593 --> 00:51:59,562
Please help us, hurry up!!

521
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:01,488
What are you doing, run after her!
-You also come along!

522
00:53:04,161 --> 00:53:06,493
Oh! She jumped on the
other side, get her!

523
00:54:10,494 --> 00:54:13,486
Hey! What are you doing?
You've damaged my car!

524
00:54:17,167 --> 00:54:22,161
Come out and see what you've
done!

525
00:54:22,573 --> 00:54:25,770
Do you have a problem with your
eyes, can't you see properly?

526
00:54:26,176 --> 00:54:29,168
How could you use your brakes
suddenly? Who gave you a licence?

527
00:54:29,613 --> 00:54:32,514
Forget it, let's go!
-You keep quiet!

528
00:54:36,186 --> 00:54:39,713
He's my youngest son but what
about this bumper that you've broken?

529
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:42,750
What do you think you were driving,
you've broken my headlights too!

530
00:54:43,193 --> 00:54:45,184
Why don't you wear glasses?

531
00:54:45,529 --> 00:54:48,191
How can you drive like this, without
giving a signal, you use the brakes?

532
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:52,200
Hey! Talk to me!
- I can talk to anyone I feel like!

533
00:54:52,536 --> 00:54:54,527
Why did you use the brake?
- Did he use the brake of your car?

534
00:54:54,638 --> 00:54:56,799
How can you use brakes of my car,
it's not for public!

535
00:54:57,207 --> 00:54:59,198
We put brakes on our car.
- So what?

536
00:54:59,376 --> 00:55:02,641
Tell me now.
-You should've seen that I was behind

537
00:55:03,146 --> 00:55:04,773
There's nothing worth
seeing in you!

538
00:55:04,881 --> 00:55:06,849
Don't act smart!
Don't argue with me.

539
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:09,744
We don't have eyes at the back
of our heads!

540
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,211
You were behind,
you could have seen us!

541
00:55:12,489 --> 00:55:16,152
What is she saying? If there are
2-4 drivers more like you then...

542
00:55:16,493 --> 00:55:18,654
Please listen...
- Don't interrupt and annoy me!

543
00:55:19,162 --> 00:55:23,155
With people like you, we must have
2 drivers, one ahead and one behind!

544
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:28,161
Don't talk too much
or I will slap you!

545
00:55:33,176 --> 00:55:37,442
Don't act tough with me, I'll file
a police complaint against you!

546
00:55:39,449 --> 00:55:41,576
Shirin, note down their number!

547
00:55:44,988 --> 00:55:47,548
He went away!!

548
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:52,186
It was our fault and you
started lecturing him!

549
00:55:52,529 --> 00:55:55,191
If you get involved in a squabble,
this is the way you should talk!

550
00:55:55,532 --> 00:55:58,524
Is it so? Okay, tell me one thing...

551
00:55:59,202 --> 00:56:03,730
how did you get into this car?
- From the door, where else?

552
00:56:05,142 --> 00:56:07,474
No, I mean, where did
you sit in this car?

553
00:56:08,145 --> 00:56:10,136
On the seat, where else?

554
00:56:12,249 --> 00:56:14,149
I mean...
-What do you mean?

555
00:56:15,318 --> 00:56:17,149
Forget it.
- No, ask me!

556
00:56:19,156 --> 00:56:22,592
Okay, where are you going?
-Where are you going?

557
00:56:23,393 --> 00:56:25,691
I am going to Mahableshwar
to meet my parents.

558
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:29,763
Does that mean half the car
will go somewhere else?

559
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:32,499
Not at all!

560
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:35,502
Then don't ask me, even I am
going to the same place.

561
00:56:37,174 --> 00:56:38,835
You are too much!

562
00:56:39,342 --> 00:56:42,175
That I am but you ask
too many questions!

563
00:56:51,221 --> 00:56:57,524
Great! Looks like
you are a very rich man!

564
00:56:58,195 --> 00:57:04,134
I may look but looks can be
deceptive! Even you looked different on that day!

565
00:57:05,135 --> 00:57:06,466
Which day?

566
00:57:06,803 --> 00:57:11,399
That day!
- Oh, that day! How was I looking?

567
00:57:12,142 --> 00:57:16,738
A stupid girl, trying to
pursue western fashion...

568
00:57:17,147 --> 00:57:23,575
with excessive make up on your
face!

569
00:57:24,254 --> 00:57:25,812
Me?!
-Yes, you!

570
00:57:26,823 --> 00:57:29,314
And look at you today. Do you know
how you look in these clothes?

571
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:31,390
How?
- Like a gypsy girl!

572
00:57:31,595 --> 00:57:36,157
That I am!
- I don't know what you are!

573
00:57:37,167 --> 00:57:39,158
But I would surely
like to know you better!

574
00:57:41,171 --> 00:57:46,165
Forget all this, before my parents
come, go and change into a sari.

575
00:57:47,978 --> 00:57:49,172
Come.

576
00:57:49,446 --> 00:57:51,573
But what is wrong
with these clothes?

577
00:57:52,315 --> 00:57:54,749
They are not bad,
they are very good!

578
00:57:55,252 --> 00:57:57,743
But is it necessary that whenever
my parents see you...

579
00:57:58,188 --> 00:58:00,179
you should always be
in a fancy dress?

580
00:58:00,457 --> 00:58:02,789
It's not necessary.
- Then let's go!

581
00:58:03,126 --> 00:58:04,286
Alright!

582
00:58:07,397 --> 00:58:09,592
This is my sister, Nirmala's room.

583
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:12,124
She is married and lives in Germany.

584
00:58:12,602 --> 00:58:16,129
There are few saris in this, you
can choose anyone from them!

585
00:58:16,473 --> 00:58:18,236
I'll wear it right away!

586
00:58:49,506 --> 00:58:57,504
You are supposed to tie them on
your feet and then walk with them!

587
00:58:58,782 --> 00:59:00,682
Oh, I see!

588
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,182
I think my parents have come,
you get dressed quickly...

589
00:59:06,456 --> 00:59:08,185
I'll go down.

590
00:59:20,203 --> 00:59:23,661
Son, the gardener said that
some girl has come with you.

591
00:59:24,207 --> 00:59:29,645
Girl?! Oh, I met Seeta on the way
and I got her...

592
00:59:30,213 --> 00:59:32,204
You got her here, what was the
need?

593
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:37,680
Seeta is very different from
what we thought about her!

594
00:59:37,921 --> 00:59:39,548
What about the scene
we saw the other day?

595
00:59:39,656 --> 00:59:41,647
It was just a drama.

596
00:59:42,225 --> 00:59:44,887
Yes mother, I was shocked
to see her today.

597
00:59:46,897 --> 00:59:49,695
Mother, she is a very smart
and a nice girl!

598
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:59,402
Unless you don't see her,
you will not believe me!

599
01:00:00,243 --> 01:00:02,438
You wait here, I'll just get her.

600
01:00:05,882 --> 01:00:07,509
Are you ready?...

601
01:00:30,206 --> 01:00:33,198
You tie it on your feet
and then walk!

602
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:36,735
And then you slip and fall?
- Sometimes.

603
01:00:37,681 --> 01:00:39,876
Won't you meet my parents?
-Yes, I will.

604
01:00:40,216 --> 01:00:41,513
Then let's go.
- Come on.

605
01:00:41,618 --> 01:00:43,210
Just a minute!

606
01:00:49,326 --> 01:00:51,226
Shall we go?
- Oh, yes!

607
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:55,421
Aren't you an Indian girl?
-Yes, I am!

608
01:00:55,665 --> 01:00:59,726
Then you are supposed to act
coy in front of my parents.

609
01:01:00,236 --> 01:01:01,828
I understand.
- So come on, act coy!

610
01:01:01,938 --> 01:01:04,168
Let's go there then I'll act coy.
-Alright.

611
01:01:15,852 --> 01:01:17,683
That's a bit too much!

612
01:01:18,855 --> 01:01:21,187
That's fine, let's go.

613
01:01:22,859 --> 01:01:27,193
What will I have to do there?
- Nothing, shake hands with them.

614
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:29,364
What?
- I am sorry...

615
01:01:29,532 --> 01:01:31,193
I said it wrong, just seek blessings.
-Your blessings?!

616
01:01:31,301 --> 01:01:33,292
No, my parent's blessings.

617
01:01:36,272 --> 01:01:38,263
And then yours?
-We'll see that later.

618
01:01:40,877 --> 01:01:44,210
You already know her!
- Come children, sit down.

619
01:01:47,217 --> 01:01:49,208
You'll sit.
-Yes, please sit.

620
01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:14,338
Seek their blessings!

621
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:24,184
Is everyone fine?
- Oh, yes!

622
01:02:24,521 --> 01:02:27,183
I liked everyone, you all!

623
01:02:27,757 --> 01:02:31,750
I am not talking about us,
how are your uncle and aunt?

624
01:02:32,262 --> 01:02:36,198
Oh, my! This aunt has come here
too! Well they...

625
01:02:36,466 --> 01:02:40,459
Child, don't they behave
properly with you?

626
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:44,638
In front of everyone she dotes on
me and puts up an act of love...

627
01:02:45,208 --> 01:02:47,540
but when we are alone,
she acts like a demon!

628
01:02:51,214 --> 01:02:53,205
Mother, I had a doubt
on that day itself.

629
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:58,213
I had seen it myself that
the other girl Sheila, kicked her!

630
01:02:58,555 --> 01:03:02,150
Didn't she kick you?
Don't lie now!

631
01:03:02,926 --> 01:03:08,523
Why should I lie?
Yes, she did kick me.

632
01:03:09,165 --> 01:03:14,159
That means the other day
what we saw was just an act!

633
01:03:14,404 --> 01:03:18,602
I have to put up an act everyday,
tell me what else can I do?

634
01:03:19,175 --> 01:03:21,405
I have to do all these things
to satiate my hunger.

635
01:03:21,678 --> 01:03:25,671
Why do you need to do that?
You don't live on their mercy!

636
01:03:26,182 --> 01:03:29,174
I have started
detesting those people!

637
01:03:29,686 --> 01:03:35,181
That day they presented her in such
a weird manner and look at her today!

638
01:03:35,859 --> 01:03:38,191
I always look good
in borrowed clothes!

639
01:03:42,198 --> 01:03:44,189
We like her frankness!

640
01:03:45,201 --> 01:03:49,194
Child, where are your bags?
- Bags?!

641
01:03:51,641 --> 01:03:58,205
Oh yes, her bags! Well actually,
her bags were left behind.

642
01:03:58,548 --> 01:04:01,142
And she came with me!

643
01:04:03,186 --> 01:04:05,746
Child, you must have
informed at home, isn't it?

644
01:04:06,156 --> 01:04:10,149
Oh, my! In this chaos I forgot
that I do have a family!

645
01:04:13,196 --> 01:04:17,155
God, I have nobody in
this world who loves me...

646
01:04:18,234 --> 01:04:23,171
it's said that you love the people
who are not loved by anyone!

647
01:04:24,574 --> 01:04:27,839
I am coming to seek your refuge.

648
01:04:33,449 --> 01:04:36,714
Wow! That was a brilliant jump!

649
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:44,183
Chief, that person is drowning!

650
01:04:51,968 --> 01:04:55,529
Aunty!!

651
01:04:58,241 --> 01:05:00,709
What happened to Geeta?
- Raka is getting her.

652
01:05:01,144 --> 01:05:03,135
She jumped in the river
to commit suicide.

653
01:05:21,464 --> 01:05:26,595
Geeta, my child, please get up!
Why isn't she talking?

654
01:05:31,174 --> 01:05:34,166
Where...
- Don't worry, child!

655
01:05:34,611 --> 01:05:39,742
You are perfectly alright!
-Why did you save me?

656
01:05:40,183 --> 01:05:44,677
Don't say that, child. Nobody ends
life over such a petty fight.

657
01:05:45,421 --> 01:05:48,754
I did not know that a small joke
would lead to such a serious thing.

658
01:05:49,626 --> 01:05:51,355
She's alright now.

659
01:05:52,195 --> 01:05:54,527
What is all this? Who are you?

660
01:05:54,831 --> 01:05:57,527
What is the matterwith you?
I am your mother, Geeta!

661
01:05:58,635 --> 01:06:00,796
Geeta? I am Seeta!

662
01:06:01,204 --> 01:06:03,468
Oh God, what is wrong
with my daughter?

663
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:09,134
My child, don't worry, nobody
will scream at you anymore!

664
01:06:10,146 --> 01:06:14,139
I will always love you, come close!

665
01:06:15,151 --> 01:06:18,143
Will you ever leave your mother
now?

666
01:06:19,155 --> 01:06:22,147
Mother!
- Stop crying, child!

667
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,149
Mother!!

668
01:06:31,467 --> 01:06:32,661
Oh, my God!

669
01:06:32,835 --> 01:06:37,169
If you hurry up then you'll
surely break your bones.

670
01:06:37,473 --> 01:06:40,772
Let it break, you are
a doctor, you can fix it!

671
01:06:41,611 --> 01:06:44,171
You can tie that white cloth
on it, what is that called?

672
01:06:44,914 --> 01:06:46,848
White cloth?!
Oh, you mean a plaster?

673
01:06:49,185 --> 01:06:50,846
No, it's called a plaster!

674
01:06:54,857 --> 01:06:58,190
Never mind, forget it! If you
really want to learn skating...

675
01:06:58,528 --> 01:07:03,465
then listen to me carefully, keep
yourweight on the front wheels...

676
01:07:04,133 --> 01:07:05,395
like this, do you understand.

677
01:07:05,501 --> 01:07:08,493
What you do is keep yourweight on
the rearwheels and that is why...

678
01:07:16,145 --> 01:07:20,138
Doctor, if you want to learn skating
then remember one thing...

679
01:07:21,818 --> 01:07:24,685
don't keep yourweight on rear
wheels, keep it on the front wheels!

680
01:07:25,321 --> 01:07:26,618
Like this!!...

681
01:08:18,141 --> 01:08:20,132
''With the winds...''

682
01:08:20,576 --> 01:08:22,567
''along the clouds...''

683
01:08:23,179 --> 01:08:27,138
''With the winds and the clouds...''

684
01:08:28,217 --> 01:08:30,310
''let's move, O companion''

685
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:34,818
''Walk with me...
all day and night''

686
01:08:35,525 --> 01:08:39,689
''Watch it... let's go hand in hand''

687
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:42,691
''Let's move, O companion...''

688
01:08:43,232 --> 01:08:47,566
''Walk with me...
all day and night, like this''

689
01:08:48,171 --> 01:08:52,505
''With your hand in mine...
let's steady ourselves and go along''

690
01:08:58,815 --> 01:09:02,581
''The weather's so lovely,
as it is...''

691
01:09:08,858 --> 01:09:12,191
''The weather's so lovely
as it is...''

692
01:09:13,796 --> 01:09:17,527
''and we're also crazy at heart''

693
01:09:18,201 --> 01:09:22,535
''Mind the mountains.
Don't collide with them...''

694
01:09:23,206 --> 01:09:27,802
''like a cloud...
let's move, my love''

695
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:59,902
''Let the world laugh,
ifit wilI''

696
01:10:06,249 --> 01:10:10,185
''Let the world laugh,
ifit wilI''

697
01:10:11,187 --> 01:10:15,180
''Let the kick of
the weather get to us''

698
01:10:15,625 --> 01:10:20,187
''Let me live in your eyes...''

699
01:10:20,596 --> 01:10:22,689
''like kohI''

700
01:10:56,566 --> 01:11:00,229
''Like your silken tresses flow''

701
01:11:06,509 --> 01:11:09,842
''Like your silken tresses flow''

702
01:11:11,514 --> 01:11:14,677
''Let me get into your arms''

703
01:11:16,252 --> 01:11:20,188
''I'm so tired today...
let me go''

704
01:11:20,523 --> 01:11:22,650
''Let's meet tomorrow''

705
01:12:06,769 --> 01:12:08,498
Please stop me!

706
01:12:52,748 --> 01:12:53,737
Hey! Stop.

707
01:13:07,163 --> 01:13:09,154
Hey! She's the same girl.

708
01:13:24,613 --> 01:13:28,174
Come on, get down!
- Hey! Which police station is this?

709
01:13:28,517 --> 01:13:30,610
Don't you recognize your own
house?

710
01:13:31,387 --> 01:13:36,188
My house?! Well actually,
inspector...

711
01:13:36,592 --> 01:13:40,187
when I left my house, it was
very small, just one room...

712
01:13:40,629 --> 01:13:42,563
it has really grown huge
in a couple of days!

713
01:13:42,732 --> 01:13:45,860
I am not acting, you are making
a mistake, this is not my house!

714
01:13:46,268 --> 01:13:47,530
Take her inside!

715
01:13:47,636 --> 01:13:49,866
I am saying the truth,
this is not my house!

716
01:13:50,539 --> 01:13:53,940
Why can't you understand,
this is not my house!

717
01:13:55,745 --> 01:13:57,542
Didn't you understand?

718
01:13:59,215 --> 01:14:00,648
You found her!

719
01:14:05,221 --> 01:14:07,815
Are you Mr. Badrinath?
- Me, l...

720
01:14:08,491 --> 01:14:11,153
What are you thinking,
you are Badrinath, tell him!

721
01:14:12,428 --> 01:14:14,726
Is she your niece, Seeta?
- Of course not!

722
01:14:15,164 --> 01:14:21,160
Where did you go, my child?
- I went to Mahableshwar, fat aunty!

723
01:14:22,838 --> 01:14:29,437
Why don't you treat her?
-We'll do it and she'll be fine!

724
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:31,840
Okay, we'll leave now.
- Okay, let's go!

725
01:14:32,214 --> 01:14:34,182
Where are you going, my child?

726
01:14:36,886 --> 01:14:38,945
Look, enough ofjoking,
I am going...

727
01:14:39,722 --> 01:14:41,349
You wretched girl!!

728
01:14:52,635 --> 01:14:55,195
Seeta, my child!!

729
01:15:00,476 --> 01:15:05,539
My child, where did you go?

730
01:15:06,182 --> 01:15:10,141
Sister, where did you go?
- Sure, go ahead and hug her!

731
01:15:10,553 --> 01:15:14,580
Stop shedding tears and ask her
where she went to defame herself?.

732
01:15:15,157 --> 01:15:18,558
Stop it, Kaushalya. I mean, why
do you want to argue so much?

733
01:15:18,828 --> 01:15:20,819
You keep quiet, you are the one
who has spoilt her!

734
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:25,530
Listen to me, if you step out of
the house, I will break your legs.

735
01:15:26,502 --> 01:15:30,598
Come, child! And what are you
doing there, come with me!

736
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:38,173
What happened to her?
- I think she has fainted.

737
01:15:38,514 --> 01:15:41,847
Grandmother, please get up!

738
01:15:42,518 --> 01:15:44,748
Child, let's take her to her room.

739
01:15:52,261 --> 01:15:56,459
Child, she is burning with fever
since past 3 days.

740
01:15:57,766 --> 01:16:01,463
Nobody is bothered about her.
Look at this!

741
01:16:03,472 --> 01:16:06,703
Forget getting medicines
but since you left...

742
01:16:07,309 --> 01:16:10,142
she did not even get
her meals on time!

743
01:16:11,814 --> 01:16:15,147
Sister, one day when grandmother
asked mother for medicine...

744
01:16:15,484 --> 01:16:19,750
she abused grandmother a lot!

745
01:16:21,156 --> 01:16:23,522
You know your aunt's nature...

746
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,150
she vents out your anger on her!

747
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:46,545
My child!

748
01:16:50,185 --> 01:16:52,176
Where are you, my child?

749
01:16:59,194 --> 01:17:04,496
Grandmother, I am here!

750
01:17:05,401 --> 01:17:07,392
I am close to you!

751
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:14,507
Child, where did you
leave me and go?

752
01:17:16,845 --> 01:17:20,474
Child, will you leave me
and go again?

753
01:17:21,917 --> 01:17:27,355
If you go away again
then I will die!

754
01:17:29,858 --> 01:17:31,849
Will you leave me, child?

755
01:17:33,495 --> 01:17:36,760
No grandmother, I will not go!

756
01:17:38,701 --> 01:17:43,400
Until there are tears in your
eyes and pain in your heart...

757
01:17:45,841 --> 01:17:52,178
and till injustice prevails in
this house, I will not go anywhere!

758
01:17:55,184 --> 01:17:57,175
Chief!
-What is it?

759
01:17:57,353 --> 01:18:00,686
There is a great news, American
people have driven car on the moon!

760
01:18:01,123 --> 01:18:03,614
Don't fib, how can
anyone drive on the moon?

761
01:18:04,126 --> 01:18:06,117
There is a picture in
the newspaper, have a look!

762
01:18:06,295 --> 01:18:10,459
Oh, yes! The Americans
can drive a car anywhere!

763
01:18:10,799 --> 01:18:12,790
But our car has stopped!

764
01:18:14,737 --> 01:18:17,137
Cheena, what is the matter
with this girl?

765
01:18:17,806 --> 01:18:21,572
The fire within her is dead!
- That's what even I was thinking.

766
01:18:22,144 --> 01:18:24,738
That jump in the water
has reformed her completely!

767
01:18:25,147 --> 01:18:27,138
And she speaks
very formally these days.

768
01:18:29,218 --> 01:18:32,153
It really annoys me, our business
has closed down because ofher!

769
01:18:33,155 --> 01:18:35,146
Let her not come,
we'll go forwork today!

770
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:40,652
I am bored of sitting here!
-Ask her once, let her come along.

771
01:18:41,163 --> 01:18:43,393
I'll not ask her, if you
want, you can go and ask!

772
01:18:43,565 --> 01:18:44,759
Alright!

773
01:18:46,502 --> 01:18:48,163
It will be good if she agrees!

774
01:18:48,337 --> 01:18:50,828
For how many days do you
intend being on strike?

775
01:18:51,173 --> 01:18:52,162
What?

776
01:18:52,374 --> 01:18:55,639
Don't you want to work, we've been
home for a long time now.

777
01:18:56,378 --> 01:18:58,846
Yes, I do want to work.

778
01:18:59,248 --> 01:19:02,183
Then let's go.
- Let me ask mother's permission.

779
01:19:02,518 --> 01:19:04,509
Child!
- There she is!

780
01:19:05,254 --> 01:19:07,779
You have washed all the clothes?!
-Ask her now!

781
01:19:09,191 --> 01:19:13,184
Mother, can I go forwork?
- Do as you please, child!

782
01:19:13,529 --> 01:19:17,522
What will she do at home, just see
how sick and pale she looks!

783
01:19:17,933 --> 01:19:19,798
She'll feel better if she steps out!

784
01:19:20,202 --> 01:19:24,536
You'll decide amongst yourselves.
-Alright, let's go!

785
01:19:27,209 --> 01:19:29,541
Let's go.
-Will you come in this dress?

786
01:19:30,212 --> 01:19:32,203
Let her come the way she wants!

787
01:19:32,548 --> 01:19:36,211
But in this outfit?! Alright,
let her try it out in this outfit.

788
01:19:36,752 --> 01:19:43,555
My dear friends, what trick
would you all like to see?

789
01:19:44,226 --> 01:19:47,218
My friends, this is not
an ordinary act.

790
01:19:47,629 --> 01:19:50,655
To walk on this tight rope
which is tied on these sticks...

791
01:19:51,233 --> 01:19:54,430
you need to be swift,
agile and alert!

792
01:19:55,237 --> 01:19:58,229
One slip could maim you for life!

793
01:19:58,907 --> 01:20:02,638
But for the sake of money, this
girl will endanger her life!

794
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:10,778
Go a little behind, anyone who
would like to offer some money...

795
01:20:11,186 --> 01:20:14,178
can put it out on this cloth below!
- Here is my advance!

796
01:20:15,357 --> 01:20:18,190
Here is my advance but
the show should be good!

797
01:20:18,527 --> 01:20:20,518
Thank you very much,
everyone please clap!

798
01:20:22,965 --> 01:20:27,698
Friends, now we present the girl
who'll walk on this rope...

799
01:20:28,203 --> 01:20:32,196
like a train,
come on, play the drums!

800
01:20:33,642 --> 01:20:37,203
Here comes that girl....

801
01:20:57,032 --> 01:21:00,661
Friends, before starting the show,
I'd like to say one more thing...

802
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:04,833
there are decent people here, but
there may also be thieves here...

803
01:21:05,174 --> 01:21:07,165
that is why, be alert of
pickpocketers...

804
01:21:07,509 --> 01:21:10,842
while watching the show,
you wallet may get stolen.

805
01:21:14,249 --> 01:21:21,178
That is why my friends, watch out!!

806
01:21:21,623 --> 01:21:26,686
It's not easy to walk on this rope,
this girl here...

807
01:21:27,196 --> 01:21:30,927
once she climbs up, she'll get
stuck to the rope like a bat.

808
01:21:31,533 --> 01:21:34,525
Come on, climb up
and start the show!

809
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:40,201
You've put me in trouble!

810
01:21:40,576 --> 01:21:43,773
He said that this girl
would walk on the rope.

811
01:21:44,246 --> 01:21:47,647
I think he is a cheat, he has
picked up this girl from somewhere!

812
01:21:48,217 --> 01:21:53,553
He has cheated us, let's bash him
up! - Sardarji, please listen to me!!

813
01:21:54,022 --> 01:21:56,547
Stop it! Let's hit him!

814
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:01,921
Aunty, enough ofit, from now on,
my partnership ends with your daughter!

815
01:22:02,497 --> 01:22:05,660
Why are you getting so angry
over such a small matter?

816
01:22:06,235 --> 01:22:09,170
Small matter?! Good I was saved
or she would have me killed today!

817
01:22:09,438 --> 01:22:11,167
Who could kill you?

818
01:22:11,506 --> 01:22:13,371
You don't know the
people of this city.

819
01:22:13,542 --> 01:22:16,170
It's fine if they are happy but if
they are angry, they can deform you!

820
01:22:16,745 --> 01:22:18,736
She should have told me if she
was not interested in working...

821
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:22,338
we would not get into this mess!
Give me a needle and a thread.

822
01:22:23,452 --> 01:22:26,182
My shirt tore and
I lost all my money!

823
01:22:26,588 --> 01:22:29,785
How will we eat now?
-You can eat here!

824
01:22:35,564 --> 01:22:39,466
You have started pampering her
a lot after her suicide attempt!

825
01:22:45,607 --> 01:22:47,802
Come on, go in!!

826
01:22:52,314 --> 01:22:54,646
Give me, I'll sew it up!

827
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:57,942
You'll do it? Get lost!

828
01:23:02,224 --> 01:23:06,160
Give it to me!
- Take it.

829
01:23:09,498 --> 01:23:11,762
Give me your shirt,
I'll stitch it up.

830
01:23:29,451 --> 01:23:32,545
Cheena, when did
she learn tailoring?

831
01:23:36,625 --> 01:23:41,619
Chief, can I tell you something?
When a girl learns stitching...

832
01:23:42,197 --> 01:23:45,189
you should understand that she'll
not do anything that is unfeminine!

833
01:23:47,269 --> 01:23:49,203
Raka, come and have lunch!

834
01:23:51,907 --> 01:23:55,206
Wow! Green vegetables
and lentils, I love it!

835
01:23:55,477 --> 01:23:57,206
I am starting, chief!

836
01:24:00,215 --> 01:24:03,673
Aunty, it's delicious, I can
kiss your hand for this!

837
01:24:04,152 --> 01:24:06,143
I've not made it, she's
the one who has cooked today.

838
01:24:06,488 --> 01:24:07,648
She?!

839
01:24:08,957 --> 01:24:12,154
In few days she has learnt
all the domestic chores!

840
01:24:16,198 --> 01:24:19,827
Chief, you wanted to kiss aunty's
hand for the vegetables...

841
01:24:20,268 --> 01:24:23,169
what will you do now?
- Shut up and eat your food!

842
01:24:24,606 --> 01:24:26,403
You talk more than your age!

843
01:24:28,176 --> 01:24:29,438
What is the matter?

844
01:24:29,544 --> 01:24:31,774
Mother, I'm calling her but
she's not listening.

845
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:35,513
I hope she has not run away again,
go down and check.

846
01:24:42,524 --> 01:24:45,960
You are yet sleeping?
Seeta, wake up!

847
01:24:50,532 --> 01:24:53,194
Are you getting up or
shall I ask mother to thrash you?

848
01:24:58,206 --> 01:25:00,197
You will not listen to me!

849
01:25:09,584 --> 01:25:13,145
What happened, my child?
Why are you crying?

850
01:25:13,488 --> 01:25:15,820
What did that witch do to you?

851
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:19,719
She hit me!
- I'll break her hands!

852
01:25:20,228 --> 01:25:25,165
She kicked me!
-What? I'll break her legs!

853
01:25:27,169 --> 01:25:31,162
You witch! How dare you
touch my fragile daughter?

854
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:38,775
Stop chewing my brains!
- How dare you!

855
01:25:39,648 --> 01:25:43,516
You've been exposed to the outside
world and lost your senses!

856
01:25:44,186 --> 01:25:47,178
Just get up so that I can
get you back into senses!

857
01:25:50,192 --> 01:25:52,683
What is wrong with you?
Have you gone mad?

858
01:25:54,196 --> 01:25:56,562
How dare you? Shameless!...

859
01:25:59,367 --> 01:26:02,131
Am I shameless?
- Oh! My hand!!

860
01:26:03,238 --> 01:26:05,866
I'll thrash you, get out!

861
01:26:09,478 --> 01:26:11,469
Why are you screaming like this?

862
01:26:11,813 --> 01:26:14,304
My hand, hurry up!!
-What is the matter?

863
01:26:17,219 --> 01:26:18,481
What happened?

864
01:26:18,653 --> 01:26:21,315
That wretched girl twisted my arm!
And you are asking what is the matter!

865
01:26:23,158 --> 01:26:25,149
She's back!
-Who is back?

866
01:26:25,727 --> 01:26:29,424
If you ever disturb my sleep,
I will deform you!

867
01:26:29,764 --> 01:26:34,167
I understand, child!
- Oh, you are calling me child!

868
01:26:37,506 --> 01:26:41,169
From now on, who will cook
in this house?...Tell me!

869
01:26:42,444 --> 01:26:45,174
I'll cook!
-And the morning tea?

870
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:48,674
I'll make it, I used to do it
in your absence.

871
01:26:49,184 --> 01:26:53,348
Oh! So you used to make
tea in the morning?

872
01:26:53,688 --> 01:26:56,248
And this buffalo used to
sleep comfortably?

873
01:26:57,292 --> 01:27:00,625
Listen fatso, you'll make the tea!
-Alright!

874
01:27:01,129 --> 01:27:09,127
Very good! Now go quickly and
make a special cup of tea for me!

875
01:27:09,437 --> 01:27:10,802
I'll get it!

876
01:27:11,139 --> 01:27:13,733
Mother, make it for me too.
- Shut up!

877
01:27:14,142 --> 01:27:17,305
Silence! If you raise
your voice, I'll slap you!

878
01:27:18,146 --> 01:27:21,138
Go quickly and make for him too!
- I'll get it!

879
01:27:21,483 --> 01:27:24,145
Kaushalya, shall I direct you
to the kitchen?

880
01:27:29,824 --> 01:27:32,486
Come here!
- Me?!

881
01:27:32,861 --> 01:27:34,488
Yes, you!

882
01:27:41,169 --> 01:27:43,831
Why is this table so dirty?

883
01:27:44,773 --> 01:27:50,177
From tomorrow, you'll wake up early
and dust the entire furniture!

884
01:27:50,579 --> 01:27:53,742
Take this, sister!
- Come on, start!

885
01:27:58,186 --> 01:28:03,214
I had heard that a dog's tail
can never be straightened.

886
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:05,717
But how did you manage this?

887
01:28:06,127 --> 01:28:12,123
If you apply force then not only the
tail even the dog become straight!

888
01:28:13,935 --> 01:28:16,130
It was a great film,
worth the money!

889
01:28:17,138 --> 01:28:21,131
The hero tells his father, I don't
want the position nor the wealth...

890
01:28:21,509 --> 01:28:23,500
I just want to marry the heroine!

891
01:28:23,778 --> 01:28:25,643
That's great, where is
this film running?

892
01:28:25,747 --> 01:28:28,147
At Taj Talkies.
- I will also see it!

893
01:28:28,483 --> 01:28:33,477
The emperor is a mean guy,
he puts the heroine in the cell...

894
01:28:37,592 --> 01:28:44,555
Hey, aunt Leela's daughter! Where
are you going dressed like this?

895
01:28:44,866 --> 01:28:48,666
Temple.
-You are going to the temple?!

896
01:28:49,504 --> 01:28:52,496
Hey! She's going to the temple.
-Why don't you come along with me?

897
01:28:52,741 --> 01:28:55,733
I don't need to go there, I don't
need anything from God...

898
01:28:56,244 --> 01:28:58,508
you carry on,
I don't have the time!

899
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:01,512
You have the time to put up an act
in front of this world...

900
01:29:02,183 --> 01:29:05,175
and the Almighty, forwhom
this world is an act...

901
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:08,182
you don't have
even little time for him?

902
01:29:09,190 --> 01:29:12,921
Look, don't talk to me like this!
I am an ordinary juggler.

903
01:29:13,528 --> 01:29:16,190
Even God is a juggler,
an ace juggler!

904
01:29:16,798 --> 01:29:19,198
You throw three balls
in the air at one go...

905
01:29:20,201 --> 01:29:24,570
but there are millions of balls made
by him which are in the universe.

906
01:29:25,573 --> 01:29:29,441
You hide a quarter in your fist and
when you open it becomes half cent...

907
01:29:30,245 --> 01:29:33,874
but when God hides
the moon in his fist...

908
01:29:34,482 --> 01:29:36,746
he brightens this world
with the sunlight, isn't it?

909
01:29:36,985 --> 01:29:42,617
Wow! That was good. I suggest you
should contest for elections!

910
01:29:43,825 --> 01:29:45,725
Okay, I am going.

911
01:29:56,771 --> 01:30:00,867
You and here?!
-Yes, I have come here!

912
01:30:01,242 --> 01:30:05,542
Why are you surprised?
-You came here suddenly!

913
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:09,008
The way you disappear suddenly,
I appear suddenly!

914
01:30:10,552 --> 01:30:13,885
People have different habits!
Can we sit?

915
01:30:15,056 --> 01:30:17,547
May we sit?
- Sure, sit down!

916
01:30:20,562 --> 01:30:21,790
What will you have?

917
01:30:21,896 --> 01:30:25,127
A sensible man will have
nothing else but water!

918
01:30:25,567 --> 01:30:28,229
Don't be formal, okay tell me,
is anyone at home?

919
01:30:28,770 --> 01:30:30,761
Why, am I not enough?

920
01:30:31,573 --> 01:30:33,905
Of course you are!

921
01:30:34,275 --> 01:30:37,733
Actually, I would like to
meet your uncle too!

922
01:30:38,213 --> 01:30:40,204
Why, what work do you
have with him?

923
01:30:40,582 --> 01:30:42,243
I have some work.
- But what is it?

924
01:30:42,584 --> 01:30:45,246
I cannot tell you!
Oh, yes! Take this.

925
01:30:45,954 --> 01:30:47,581
What is in this?
- It is...

926
01:30:49,023 --> 01:30:51,583
Hello, uncle!
- Hello, how are you, my child?

927
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:53,794
I am fine!
- I'll be back in a moment!

928
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:57,061
Sit down, Ravi!

929
01:31:01,536 --> 01:31:06,030
Uncle, actually I have been
sent here by my parents.

930
01:31:06,541 --> 01:31:08,532
Oh, I see!

931
01:31:09,544 --> 01:31:14,538
Uncle, all I have to say is that we
give our consent for this proposal.

932
01:31:16,217 --> 01:31:19,550
And if you give your consent then
I'll consider myself very fortunate.

933
01:31:20,622 --> 01:31:23,557
Ravi, we'll be fortunate
to accept this proposal...

934
01:31:24,225 --> 01:31:26,557
and Seeta would get
a husband like you!

935
01:31:26,928 --> 01:31:29,556
I'll write a letter to your father
and fix the marriage date.

936
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:01,051
Are you happy?

937
01:32:01,729 --> 01:32:04,960
Hey! Why are you crying?

938
01:32:06,534 --> 01:32:08,525
It's nothing!

939
01:32:09,604 --> 01:32:12,129
Aren't you happy?

940
01:32:13,608 --> 01:32:18,910
I am very happy, so happy
that it scares me!

941
01:32:19,547 --> 01:32:21,913
Why should you get scared?

942
01:32:23,985 --> 01:32:27,978
Ravi, you have no idea who I am!

943
01:32:28,656 --> 01:32:30,988
I am...
- I know one thing for sure!

944
01:32:31,326 --> 01:32:33,988
Whoeveryou are, you surely
are a little crazy!

945
01:32:35,230 --> 01:32:37,095
Not much but little!

946
01:32:38,566 --> 01:32:42,127
Okay madam, I am free on Sunday
and you are going out with me!

947
01:32:42,637 --> 01:32:44,571
But Ravi...
-Yes or no?

948
01:32:45,573 --> 01:32:47,564
Ravi, you...
- No?

949
01:32:52,914 --> 01:32:54,108
Coming!

950
01:32:56,951 --> 01:32:59,511
Have you cooked the lentils?
- Long back, mother!

951
01:32:59,721 --> 01:33:01,712
Give this, I'll clean it.
- No, I'll do it!

952
01:33:01,956 --> 01:33:06,120
No mother, I'll do it!
- Let me also do something.

953
01:33:09,964 --> 01:33:12,524
Why are you screaming,
what is the matter?

954
01:33:12,867 --> 01:33:18,533
Are you coming to PascaI's den?
- No, I am broke!

955
01:33:18,873 --> 01:33:21,865
Nobody gives me a loan.
- Forget your state!

956
01:33:22,644 --> 01:33:26,546
I am loaded today,
look I have 15 rupees.

957
01:33:26,881 --> 01:33:29,543
Speak softly, someone
may pick your pocket!

958
01:33:29,884 --> 01:33:32,751
If anyone tries to do that
I will kill that person!

959
01:33:33,554 --> 01:33:35,818
Aren't you my friend?

960
01:33:36,557 --> 01:33:39,219
Walk quietly!

961
01:33:42,563 --> 01:33:44,554
Yes, aunty!
- So, you are going?

962
01:33:44,766 --> 01:33:49,135
I'm not going to have alcohol,
this Raghu lives down the street...

963
01:33:49,737 --> 01:33:52,968
he has a wife and four children...

964
01:33:53,975 --> 01:33:57,502
so how can a family man
go and have alcohol?

965
01:33:57,912 --> 01:34:01,848
I'm going to tell Pascal to stop
giving him credit or liquor.

966
01:34:02,617 --> 01:34:05,814
Stop making such noises,
shameless man!

967
01:34:11,326 --> 01:34:14,887
Everyone seems to be drinking,
I'll go and fix everyone right!

968
01:34:15,797 --> 01:34:19,528
This is the only flaw he has,
he has to drink everyday!

969
01:34:21,235 --> 01:34:26,537
There is nobody who will stop him!
He has no family.

970
01:34:26,941 --> 01:34:30,536
If he gives up on alcohol,
he'd be a very good person!

971
01:34:42,924 --> 01:34:46,553
''With a drink in my hands...''

972
01:34:47,328 --> 01:34:50,559
''goodness! There's so much to do''

973
01:34:51,566 --> 01:34:58,028
''When I have the time,
let's see what happens...''

974
01:34:59,807 --> 01:35:06,508
''I'll think about the world too''

975
01:35:41,549 --> 01:35:44,814
''Why think of death,
when I haven't even lived enough?''

976
01:35:45,553 --> 01:35:48,886
''Why must I worry
about tomorrow?''

977
01:35:49,557 --> 01:35:53,550
''Who's scared of a night
of sorrow...?''

978
01:35:53,828 --> 01:35:57,491
''the evening's so lovely''

979
01:36:01,636 --> 01:36:05,072
''The evening's so lovely''

980
01:36:06,274 --> 01:36:09,505
''I have so much to do''

981
01:36:10,511 --> 01:36:17,246
''When I have the time for it,
I'll see what happens''

982
01:36:18,519 --> 01:36:25,516
''As for the world... aah!
I'll think about it''

983
01:36:27,028 --> 01:36:30,520
''Right now, I have a drink''

984
01:37:00,294 --> 01:37:03,491
''I was a bit tired...''

985
01:37:04,499 --> 01:37:07,662
''I added a bit of falsehood
to the truth''

986
01:37:08,503 --> 01:37:11,995
''From the bottle,
I took a swig...''

987
01:37:12,507 --> 01:37:16,170
''and I really find
a bit of peace now''

988
01:37:20,314 --> 01:37:24,114
''Though I feel better...''

989
01:37:24,852 --> 01:37:28,083
''goodness! There's so much to do''

990
01:37:29,290 --> 01:37:35,854
''When I have the time,
I'll see how things go''

991
01:37:36,864 --> 01:37:44,532
''About the world... aah!
I'll think''

992
01:38:21,576 --> 01:38:24,773
Listen.
-Who is it?

993
01:38:27,682 --> 01:38:31,049
It's you, at this hour?!

994
01:38:31,886 --> 01:38:36,789
Why aren't you sleeping?
Go on, go to sleep!

995
01:38:37,592 --> 01:38:39,583
You come home first.

996
01:38:42,597 --> 01:38:47,796
Whose home should I go to?

997
01:38:48,536 --> 01:38:53,530
Your home!
- I don't know where my home is!

998
01:38:53,874 --> 01:38:56,866
You know where my home is?
-Yes, I know it!

999
01:38:57,878 --> 01:39:00,540
You know it?!
-Yes, come with me!

1000
01:39:00,915 --> 01:39:04,544
Okay, take me home!!

1001
01:39:06,887 --> 01:39:10,983
Are you harassing me, do you
really know where my house is?

1002
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:18,556
You are a very nice girl,
you know where my house is!

1003
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:22,094
It's a problem finding it,
where is it?

1004
01:39:22,570 --> 01:39:24,231
Here is your house!

1005
01:39:24,605 --> 01:39:28,564
Is this my house?

1006
01:39:31,646 --> 01:39:34,911
Do you call this a house?

1007
01:39:36,584 --> 01:39:40,577
Come inside with me
and see my house!

1008
01:39:41,022 --> 01:39:47,586
Do you call these fourwalls
and a roof, a house?

1009
01:39:48,396 --> 01:39:52,924
Is this bed, chair or
this window my house?

1010
01:39:53,634 --> 01:40:00,938
A home is made with a family and
I don't have anyone in this world!

1011
01:40:01,876 --> 01:40:07,644
No parents nor siblings,
I don't have anyone!

1012
01:40:08,549 --> 01:40:15,045
I was born on the footpath and
raised up on the streets...

1013
01:40:15,556 --> 01:40:20,619
then someday, I will
die in this closed room!

1014
01:40:21,329 --> 01:40:25,993
And then, the municipality van
will come here...

1015
01:40:26,567 --> 01:40:31,937
and will take me away! That will
be the end of the story!

1016
01:40:40,581 --> 01:40:44,244
What are you doing?
-Who says that you have nobody?

1017
01:40:46,954 --> 01:40:50,583
Raka, can't you ever
give up on alcohol?

1018
01:40:51,592 --> 01:40:55,187
If I don't drink then
how will I live?

1019
01:40:56,530 --> 01:40:59,966
But what difference
does it make to you?

1020
01:41:00,801 --> 01:41:02,792
What ifit does make a difference?

1021
01:41:39,573 --> 01:41:42,565
Chief, I have come to you!

1022
01:41:45,112 --> 01:41:50,846
I know I've come late but l
couldn't help it, I was side tracked!

1023
01:41:51,585 --> 01:41:56,113
Last night, Geeta told me that
I should stop drinking...

1024
01:41:56,524 --> 01:42:01,086
and I should start working. When l
heard her, I had tears in my eyes!

1025
01:42:01,529 --> 01:42:04,191
At that moment I decided that l
would come to you in the morning...

1026
01:42:04,832 --> 01:42:08,791
and say that I am sorry forwhatever
wrong that I've done till date!

1027
01:42:09,537 --> 01:42:12,938
From today, I will
never touch alcohol!

1028
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:15,934
Even if Pascal gives it to me
free, I will not have it!

1029
01:42:16,944 --> 01:42:20,539
Chief, you are the supreme being...

1030
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:24,541
please forgive me!

1031
01:42:47,942 --> 01:42:52,879
God, give Raka the strength
to fulfill his promise!

1032
01:42:55,216 --> 01:42:57,116
No child, this medicine
is very bitter.

1033
01:42:57,618 --> 01:42:59,518
Stop it, grandmother!
- It's little.

1034
01:42:59,653 --> 01:43:02,121
Hold your nose and drink it,
the doctor said...

1035
01:43:02,590 --> 01:43:04,956
if you have this medicine,
you'll become perfectly alright!

1036
01:43:05,659 --> 01:43:09,857
One..two..three...five!!

1037
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:15,964
When you were small,
I was your grandmother...

1038
01:43:16,871 --> 01:43:19,203
but now I feel that
you've become my grandmother!

1039
01:43:21,542 --> 01:43:24,705
No grandmother,
she has become a don!

1040
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:28,075
You imp! You've
started talking a lot!

1041
01:43:28,616 --> 01:43:31,983
Okay listen, Mr. Gupta has come!

1042
01:43:32,553 --> 01:43:38,287
Oh, the lawyer! That poor man
is not aware of anything.

1043
01:43:39,627 --> 01:43:47,625
The money he gives you, is taken
away from you, after he leaves!

1044
01:43:48,903 --> 01:43:52,168
Mr. Badrinath, I am glad that
this alliance has been fixed.

1045
01:43:52,907 --> 01:43:56,843
Even we are very happy!
- But where is Seeta?

1046
01:43:58,546 --> 01:44:00,514
Here I am!

1047
01:44:01,115 --> 01:44:02,844
Come, dear.

1048
01:44:03,517 --> 01:44:05,849
Come child, we were
talking about you!

1049
01:44:06,954 --> 01:44:10,151
Oh, I see!
- Child, how are you?

1050
01:44:10,591 --> 01:44:13,526
I am fine, how are you?

1051
01:44:14,695 --> 01:44:16,185
I am fine.

1052
01:44:17,264 --> 01:44:20,961
Mr. Badrinath, I can
see a change in her.

1053
01:44:21,869 --> 01:44:23,860
She's got self confidence!

1054
01:44:24,204 --> 01:44:26,104
She's changed a lot!
-Yes!

1055
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:32,945
It's not only me, by the grace of
God, something has happened...

1056
01:44:33,347 --> 01:44:36,544
due to which all the family members
have changed quite a bit!

1057
01:44:37,551 --> 01:44:39,542
Isn't it, aunty?

1058
01:44:40,287 --> 01:44:45,088
Yes, you are right!
-Wow! She has started talking a lot!

1059
01:44:45,659 --> 01:44:47,889
Formerly, she used to sit quietly.

1060
01:44:48,629 --> 01:44:51,564
Now I feel that you aunt is
taking care of you!

1061
01:44:51,865 --> 01:44:57,497
No, first she took care of me
and now I take care ofher!

1062
01:44:57,838 --> 01:45:01,934
After all, even I have certain
duties, isn't it, aunty?

1063
01:45:02,509 --> 01:45:04,500
That's right!

1064
01:45:05,746 --> 01:45:07,737
Alright then let me also
fulfill my duty.

1065
01:45:07,915 --> 01:45:11,078
This is your monthly allowance.
- Thank you very much!

1066
01:45:11,518 --> 01:45:14,510
Please count them.
- Mr. Gupta, why do you always insist?

1067
01:45:14,855 --> 01:45:16,584
Give your uncle..

1068
01:45:16,890 --> 01:45:21,122
Why, is his counting more superior
than Mr. Gupta's honesty?

1069
01:45:21,862 --> 01:45:24,922
Mr. Gupta, there is
no need to count them.

1070
01:45:25,532 --> 01:45:27,193
But yet if...
- No...

1071
01:45:27,534 --> 01:45:29,866
I don't want to insult you
by counting this money!

1072
01:45:30,537 --> 01:45:34,940
Child, since the past 20 years
I have been coming in this house...

1073
01:45:35,976 --> 01:45:38,103
for the first time,
without counting...

1074
01:45:38,345 --> 01:45:41,940
Many things are happening for the
first time in this house these days!

1075
01:45:42,549 --> 01:45:47,953
Isn't it, aunty?
-Yes!

1076
01:45:48,856 --> 01:45:50,551
Okay Mr. Badrinath,
I'll take your leave now.

1077
01:45:50,658 --> 01:45:53,559
You are leaving?
-Yes, I'll leave now. Good bye!

1078
01:45:53,827 --> 01:45:55,658
Good bye!
- Good bye!

1079
01:45:55,829 --> 01:45:57,888
May God bless you.
- Let me drop you to the door.

1080
01:46:13,313 --> 01:46:18,512
Aunty!
- Child, I was suggesting that you...

1081
01:46:18,786 --> 01:46:23,280
What were you suggesting?
- May I keep this money in the safe?

1082
01:46:23,791 --> 01:46:25,782
You'll keep it in the safe?

1083
01:46:29,196 --> 01:46:31,187
Here, keep it!

1084
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:34,531
I'll be back in a moment!

1085
01:47:03,263 --> 01:47:11,261
It's very heavy, your delicate waist
cannot take the burden of these keys.

1086
01:47:12,306 --> 01:47:14,501
Never mind, I'll keep them with me!

1087
01:47:14,908 --> 01:47:18,844
Yes, you can keep it!
Seeta, my child...

1088
01:47:25,519 --> 01:47:28,044
Get away! Is the food ready?
- Not yet...

1089
01:47:28,522 --> 01:47:30,513
It should be ready
by 1 p.m., get that?

1090
01:47:30,858 --> 01:47:33,019
Go now!!

1091
01:47:43,537 --> 01:47:45,528
Kaushalya, I can smell
something burning.

1092
01:47:45,706 --> 01:47:47,537
My heart it burning.

1093
01:47:47,875 --> 01:47:49,866
That means you are cooking
non vegetarian food.

1094
01:47:50,277 --> 01:47:53,144
You like to rub salt over
my wounds, move away!

1095
01:47:53,547 --> 01:47:56,482
That terrible girl made me a cook
and you could not say a word!

1096
01:47:56,817 --> 01:48:01,914
It's the law of nature, the
powerful one rules the roost!

1097
01:48:02,489 --> 01:48:05,925
Let her do as she pleases,
let my brother come back...

1098
01:48:06,493 --> 01:48:09,485
he'll fix her right!

1099
01:48:09,830 --> 01:48:13,493
I hope your brother does not
get thrashed in bargain!

1100
01:48:13,901 --> 01:48:17,962
Nonsense! Ranjit is my brother!

1101
01:48:19,506 --> 01:48:21,974
That means now he'll show
his true colors?

1102
01:48:22,509 --> 01:48:23,999
He will...
-Aunty!

1103
01:48:24,211 --> 01:48:25,303
Coming, child!

1104
01:48:25,646 --> 01:48:27,978
I've made all your favorite
dishes today.

1105
01:48:28,515 --> 01:48:30,949
I have made ladyfingers,
green vegetables...

1106
01:48:31,218 --> 01:48:33,948
and you'll be very pleased
to eat fried bitter gourd!

1107
01:48:34,521 --> 01:48:36,318
Please sit and eat!

1108
01:48:39,526 --> 01:48:42,859
Kaushalya, the kid
played a prank on you!

1109
01:48:44,531 --> 01:48:47,193
She is very naughty, she keeps
fooling around!

1110
01:48:47,601 --> 01:48:49,535
Just like you!
- Naughty girl!

1111
01:48:51,872 --> 01:48:57,538
You will not sit here, sit there!
- But I always sit here.

1112
01:48:57,878 --> 01:49:00,540
Now, the mistress of this house
will sit here!

1113
01:49:00,881 --> 01:49:02,712
Did you get that? Come on, move!

1114
01:49:02,883 --> 01:49:06,979
You can sit here if you wish,
I can sit anywhere...

1115
01:49:07,554 --> 01:49:11,081
the idea is to eat...
-Wait! I'll be back right away!

1116
01:49:15,562 --> 01:49:18,554
Where has this stupid gone?
-Wait, I'll set her right!

1117
01:49:19,733 --> 01:49:21,963
They all are waiting foryou!

1118
01:49:22,569 --> 01:49:26,562
Child, how can I eat with them?

1119
01:49:26,907 --> 01:49:29,899
No, they will eat with you!

1120
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:55,864
From today, grandmother
will sit in this place.

1121
01:49:56,169 --> 01:49:58,069
Did you understand?
-Yes, child!

1122
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:01,870
And from today, she'll have
all the keys to this house!

1123
01:50:02,209 --> 01:50:04,143
Did you understand this too?
-Yes!

1124
01:50:04,578 --> 01:50:08,981
Hold these keys, you are
the mistress of this house!

1125
01:50:09,549 --> 01:50:11,540
Hold these keys!

1126
01:50:16,657 --> 01:50:19,558
What are you watching,
come on, start eating!

1127
01:50:22,562 --> 01:50:23,551
Then what happened?

1128
01:50:23,664 --> 01:50:26,132
That fatso acted as if it
didn't effect her!

1129
01:50:26,566 --> 01:50:29,091
She said that I am
a very naughty girl!

1130
01:50:29,670 --> 01:50:32,002
That you are! How much sugar?

1131
01:50:33,907 --> 01:50:36,239
Is this sugar?

1132
01:50:38,578 --> 01:50:40,569
Why do they make blocks of sugar?

1133
01:50:41,281 --> 01:50:44,978
They are not blocks of sugar,
they are called sugar cubes!

1134
01:50:45,619 --> 01:50:46,847
What?

1135
01:50:56,530 --> 01:50:59,522
Forget it, keep it aside!
-Why are you getting annoyed?

1136
01:51:06,606 --> 01:51:09,006
How are you?
- Fine, thank you!

1137
01:51:12,145 --> 01:51:17,549
How is your knee now?
- It had become fine but...

1138
01:51:18,085 --> 01:51:20,076
Has it started hurting again?
-Yes!

1139
01:51:20,554 --> 01:51:22,044
Let me check.

1140
01:51:26,193 --> 01:51:29,060
Do you apply the ointment
everyday? -Yes, I do!

1141
01:51:30,564 --> 01:51:33,556
Do one thing, come to the clinic
tomorrow, we'll take a X-ray.

1142
01:51:49,583 --> 01:51:50,914
Hey! Listen.

1143
01:53:31,017 --> 01:53:35,954
''There's this girl I saw
in my dreams last night...''

1144
01:53:36,556 --> 01:53:41,550
''she had a beautiful face
and a lovely name''

1145
01:53:47,667 --> 01:53:51,899
''And I met this boy
in my dream last night''

1146
01:53:52,239 --> 01:53:56,938
''He was so handsome to look at
and he had a nice name too''

1147
01:54:30,844 --> 01:54:35,543
''Had I seen the woman
who was my bloody rival...''

1148
01:54:35,949 --> 01:54:40,545
''I'd have killed her,
I swear''

1149
01:54:41,354 --> 01:54:46,291
''Had I seen the lover
you dreamed about...''

1150
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:50,890
''I'd have ended my life,
I swear''

1151
01:54:51,765 --> 01:54:54,495
''Why're you sulking again?
- Because you're sulking!''

1152
01:54:56,503 --> 01:55:01,497
''You are the one
I met in my dreams last night''

1153
01:55:01,908 --> 01:55:06,504
''And you are the one
I met in my dreams too''

1154
01:55:07,013 --> 01:55:11,848
''You and I needed
to see each other very badly''

1155
01:55:17,557 --> 01:55:22,859
''You and I sure needed to
see each other very badly''

1156
01:56:14,014 --> 01:56:18,951
''So many times we met
on moonlit nights...''

1157
01:56:19,286 --> 01:56:22,847
''we said so many loving things
to each other''

1158
01:56:24,524 --> 01:56:28,961
''All night, we were awake.
I gazed into his eyes...''

1159
01:56:29,529 --> 01:56:33,863
''we promised so much love
to each other''

1160
01:56:34,634 --> 01:56:37,125
''You're a liar!
-You're the liar!''

1161
01:56:39,539 --> 01:56:41,530
''There was this boy...
- There was this girl...''

1162
01:56:41,875 --> 01:56:46,539
''a lovely meeting I had with
the beloved in my dreams last night''

1163
01:56:47,314 --> 01:56:52,115
''What a face..
what a nice name''

1164
01:57:33,860 --> 01:57:36,124
Hello!
- May God bless you, son!

1165
01:57:36,529 --> 01:57:38,520
How are you?
- Fine, thank you!

1166
01:57:41,634 --> 01:57:47,539
Do you know my brother?
-Yes. Seeing you after long, Ranjit.

1167
01:57:48,074 --> 01:57:52,534
Yes, I had been to Delhi
for business purpose.

1168
01:57:52,812 --> 01:57:54,939
He has a vast
import export business!

1169
01:57:55,248 --> 01:57:59,810
By God's grace he has everything,
all that he lacks is a house!

1170
01:58:00,487 --> 01:58:02,478
That is why the poor man
lives with his sister!

1171
01:58:02,822 --> 01:58:04,756
You've started talking a lot.

1172
01:58:05,492 --> 01:58:09,485
Ravi, what is father's
brother called?

1173
01:58:10,497 --> 01:58:13,489
Uncle.
-And uncle's wife?

1174
01:58:15,502 --> 01:58:18,835
Aunty!
-And aunty's brother?

1175
01:58:21,508 --> 01:58:26,946
He's called a'chuchu'. Ravi, you
talk to 'chuchu', I'll be back!

1176
01:58:27,514 --> 01:58:31,006
Listen, I am going.
-Why are you going so soon?

1177
01:58:31,518 --> 01:58:34,510
Yes, I have some work. Good bye!

1178
01:58:39,626 --> 01:58:43,528
Aunty, you talk to him, I'm going!

1179
01:58:55,074 --> 01:58:57,065
Did you see that?
-You keep quiet, sister!

1180
01:58:57,544 --> 01:59:00,707
It's your fault, you must
have left her loose.

1181
01:59:01,147 --> 01:59:05,083
I went out for few days and this
girl has forgotten her limits?

1182
01:59:05,552 --> 01:59:08,885
You don't know what
all she did after you left.

1183
01:59:09,222 --> 01:59:11,554
She also doesn't know
what I can do!

1184
01:59:12,559 --> 01:59:17,895
You don't interfere, I will go and
skin her hide! You wait here!

1185
01:59:26,906 --> 01:59:28,897
You have lost your mind!

1186
01:59:30,577 --> 01:59:32,568
You need a lot of overhauling!

1187
01:59:33,913 --> 01:59:37,576
By threatening Sheila and sister
you think you are very smart?

1188
01:59:40,019 --> 01:59:45,582
Don't you recognize this? This has
given you many injuries even before!

1189
01:59:47,594 --> 01:59:51,189
Have you forgotten the thrashing?
You'll do only as I say!

1190
01:59:52,632 --> 01:59:55,192
From now on, you will behave
as you used to!

1191
01:59:55,935 --> 01:59:59,063
You will cook and
wash the vessels...

1192
01:59:59,539 --> 02:00:01,530
you will clean the house, get it?

1193
02:00:05,545 --> 02:00:08,207
And you will sit and rule on me?

1194
02:00:28,968 --> 02:00:32,199
No, Seeta!
- Stop chanting my name!

1195
02:00:43,583 --> 02:00:46,575
I will skin your hide
and stuff you up!

1196
02:00:55,862 --> 02:00:58,524
Grandmother, please save me!!

1197
02:00:59,532 --> 02:01:04,697
Coward, you're pleading to the one
whom you never sympathized with!

1198
02:01:05,905 --> 02:01:08,066
No Seeta, won't you listen to me?

1199
02:01:09,542 --> 02:01:12,534
Grandmother?!
- Go up to your room!

1200
02:01:18,885 --> 02:01:21,877
If you have some shame left in you
then wear my bangles!

1201
02:01:33,266 --> 02:01:35,564
What are you doing,
this is not an ox's back!

1202
02:01:35,735 --> 02:01:38,226
But she whipped you thinking
you are an ox!

1203
02:01:38,571 --> 02:01:42,564
Damn that girl, she has
whipped you up like cream!

1204
02:01:42,909 --> 02:01:46,572
Mother, take this.
- Got it, have you heated it well?

1205
02:01:48,581 --> 02:01:54,679
I'll put this turmeric paste on you
& very soon you'll become fine!

1206
02:02:04,530 --> 02:02:07,522
Grandmother, what are you doing?

1207
02:02:11,638 --> 02:02:14,539
What?
- I am reading the Bhagvad Gita.

1208
02:02:16,209 --> 02:02:19,872
Come and listen to what
Lord Krishna tells his devotees.

1209
02:02:20,246 --> 02:02:22,237
What does he say?

1210
02:02:22,882 --> 02:02:26,113
He says whenever there will be
a rise of evil in this world...

1211
02:02:26,552 --> 02:02:29,544
he will come to slay the evil!
- Has he ever come to fight the evil?

1212
02:02:30,156 --> 02:02:35,093
My child, every human being who
fights evil and injustice...

1213
02:02:35,728 --> 02:02:37,719
is a reincarnation of God!

1214
02:02:38,564 --> 02:02:42,056
Grandmother, what if one has to
resort to a lie to fight injustice...

1215
02:02:42,568 --> 02:02:44,559
then is that too a sin?

1216
02:02:44,937 --> 02:02:46,928
Lord Krishna says...

1217
02:02:47,573 --> 02:02:50,565
that if one has to resort to a lie
for a good cause...

1218
02:02:51,077 --> 02:02:53,568
then that one lie is equivalent
to many truths!

1219
02:02:59,285 --> 02:03:02,516
Sir!
-Where were you, you old man?

1220
02:03:03,523 --> 02:03:05,855
Why does it take you two hours
to buy a pack of cigarettes?

1221
02:03:06,993 --> 02:03:09,188
What are you seeing now,
give me a light!

1222
02:03:21,541 --> 02:03:24,533
You oaf! Can't you
even light one cigarette?

1223
02:03:25,011 --> 02:03:26,535
Get lost!

1224
02:03:42,128 --> 02:03:44,119
Ramu is very much older than you...

1225
02:03:44,997 --> 02:03:48,558
almost like your father!
Apologize to him!

1226
02:03:55,508 --> 02:03:57,840
Ranjit, apologize to him.

1227
02:04:00,513 --> 02:04:02,105
Ramukaka, wait here.

1228
02:04:15,528 --> 02:04:19,692
Didn't you hear me Ranjit,
apologize to Ramukaka!

1229
02:04:26,973 --> 02:04:28,531
Come on!

1230
02:04:30,543 --> 02:04:33,011
Forgive me.
- Not like this!

1231
02:04:34,881 --> 02:04:36,872
Bow down before him!

1232
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:41,543
Come on, do it!

1233
02:04:46,893 --> 02:04:48,884
Ramukaka, please forgive me!

1234
02:04:51,130 --> 02:04:52,563
Wait!

1235
02:04:55,501 --> 02:04:59,995
Which brand of cigarettes
do you smoke? Oh, it's 555!

1236
02:05:00,973 --> 02:05:02,964
And what do you contribute
towards this house?

1237
02:05:03,509 --> 02:05:04,840
Nothing!

1238
02:05:06,512 --> 02:05:14,180
If you eat in this house without
working then I'll whip you 555 times!

1239
02:05:15,321 --> 02:05:18,984
Ramukaka, Ranjit will go to
the market to get the groceries!

1240
02:05:22,028 --> 02:05:24,019
Sir, everything is fresh!
- How much is this spinach for?

1241
02:05:24,530 --> 02:05:28,193
You're only asking the price,
are you buying forthe first time?

1242
02:05:28,601 --> 02:05:31,092
Why are you getting annoyed,
are you giving it for free?

1243
02:05:34,240 --> 02:05:35,764
What is this?
-Aubergine!

1244
02:05:35,875 --> 02:05:38,139
Do aubergines look like this?
Okay, what is the price?

1245
02:05:38,544 --> 02:05:40,535
Rs. 2 per kilo.
- Okay, give me a kilo.

1246
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:03,832
Where had you been?
- Oh, it's you?

1247
02:06:05,238 --> 02:06:08,503
What is the matter,
why do you look so scared?

1248
02:06:09,308 --> 02:06:12,835
Nothing!
- Tell me clearly, what is the matter?

1249
02:06:15,882 --> 02:06:18,874
I am scared!
-About what?

1250
02:06:19,518 --> 02:06:21,850
I am scared that someone
may separate you from me!

1251
02:06:23,522 --> 02:06:27,515
Who can dare to do that?
Don't you trust me?

1252
02:06:28,527 --> 02:06:30,859
I do but I don't trust my fate!

1253
02:06:31,530 --> 02:06:33,930
You fool, one can change
the fate in a jiffy!

1254
02:06:34,133 --> 02:06:35,862
You wait here,
I'll be back in a moment.

1255
02:06:35,935 --> 02:06:40,531
Where are you going?
- To go and join your and my destiny!

1256
02:06:41,307 --> 02:06:43,207
Can I go?

1257
02:06:46,812 --> 02:06:49,906
Sister, it's a very auspicious date.

1258
02:06:50,549 --> 02:06:54,485
You should fix up the marriage
on the 18th of this month!

1259
02:06:54,921 --> 02:06:57,981
Alright!
- Priest, 18th is very far.

1260
02:06:58,491 --> 02:07:03,155
Can't you make it earlier?
- No son, it has to be on the 18th!

1261
02:07:03,496 --> 02:07:04,827
Alright then!

1262
02:07:05,197 --> 02:07:06,186
18th?!

1263
02:07:06,599 --> 02:07:09,932
Yes, Ravi's parents
have decided the date.

1264
02:07:10,503 --> 02:07:12,061
And I gave my consent.
- But, uncle...

1265
02:07:12,138 --> 02:07:14,129
Child, don't forget that we are
from the bride's side...

1266
02:07:14,507 --> 02:07:18,807
if we dillydally then
they may misunderstand us!

1267
02:07:19,812 --> 02:07:23,680
Besides, it's very rare to find
boys like Ravi in this age!

1268
02:07:24,050 --> 02:07:28,510
Okay, I will go to the jewellers
and get your ornaments.

1269
02:07:28,854 --> 02:07:31,516
Uncle...
-Yes, child.

1270
02:07:33,526 --> 02:07:36,518
Nothing!
- May you always be happy!

1271
02:07:55,214 --> 02:08:01,813
I have no right to
call you my parents...

1272
02:08:02,488 --> 02:08:07,482
I have hidden the fact that I am
not your daughter and the only...

1273
02:08:08,027 --> 02:08:13,488
reason for it was, to wipe
the injustice prevailing here!

1274
02:08:14,834 --> 02:08:17,826
But what shall I do now?

1275
02:08:18,904 --> 02:08:21,498
These people, who consider me
as your daughter, Seeta...

1276
02:08:22,508 --> 02:08:24,499
want me to marry Ravi!

1277
02:08:25,945 --> 02:08:29,506
They don't know that I'm not Seeta,
who belongs to an affluent family.

1278
02:08:31,017 --> 02:08:34,180
I am just an ordinary gypsy girl
Geeta, who performs on the streets!

1279
02:08:35,521 --> 02:08:39,514
Please tell me what I should do?

1280
02:08:44,063 --> 02:08:46,054
Whose picture is this?

1281
02:08:46,866 --> 02:08:52,065
This is Mr. Badrinath's niece, Seeta!
- That's what even I thought...

1282
02:08:52,571 --> 02:08:58,203
but she's Seeta's look alike,
a gypsy girl called Geeta!

1283
02:08:58,911 --> 02:09:00,902
Then where is Seeta?

1284
02:09:01,213 --> 02:09:05,081
You have to find her, wherever she
may be, you have to get her here!

1285
02:09:05,551 --> 02:09:09,544
But before the 18th of this month!

1286
02:09:10,923 --> 02:09:13,084
Watch out, uncle.

1287
02:09:13,559 --> 02:09:16,050
If I could watch then
why would I fall?

1288
02:09:16,295 --> 02:09:18,923
I am sorry, here is your stick!

1289
02:09:20,566 --> 02:09:24,002
Child, my car must be somewhere
around, please take me there...

1290
02:09:24,570 --> 02:09:26,561
Come on, I'll take you there.

1291
02:09:37,983 --> 02:09:39,917
Sit down quietly or else...

1292
02:09:48,594 --> 02:09:51,859
Child, you aren't yet ready?

1293
02:09:53,265 --> 02:09:55,199
The wedding procession
must be on it's way.

1294
02:09:55,534 --> 02:09:58,196
Uncle, I...
- I understand, child.

1295
02:09:58,871 --> 02:10:04,537
If your parent's were alive, your
motherwould dress you up as a bride!

1296
02:10:05,544 --> 02:10:07,876
And brotherwould send you away
to your husband's house!

1297
02:10:08,547 --> 02:10:11,072
But what can I do child,
I am feeling very lonely!

1298
02:10:13,886 --> 02:10:16,218
Okay child, I am going,
you get dressed.

1299
02:10:54,760 --> 02:11:00,062
I am very lucky
to have you in my life!

1300
02:11:01,534 --> 02:11:07,530
I have a wife who is beautiful,
cultured & from a decent family.

1301
02:11:08,874 --> 02:11:10,136
Marrying you...

1302
02:11:11,610 --> 02:11:13,874
What is the matter?
- Ravi, I...

1303
02:11:14,647 --> 02:11:16,547
What is the matter?

1304
02:11:17,216 --> 02:11:19,207
We are starting a new
life from today.

1305
02:11:20,553 --> 02:11:22,544
I don't want to hide
anything from you!

1306
02:11:23,656 --> 02:11:30,824
I am not what you've been thinking!
-What do you mean?

1307
02:11:31,230 --> 02:11:33,562
I don't belong to any
affluent family.

1308
02:11:33,966 --> 02:11:35,957
I am just an ordinary gypsy girl...

1309
02:11:36,569 --> 02:11:39,231
whom these people have mistook
as Seeta and got home!

1310
02:11:42,107 --> 02:11:46,567
What are you saying?
-Yes Ravi, I am Geeta!

1311
02:11:47,346 --> 02:11:49,337
My work is to perform
dances on the street.

1312
02:11:51,250 --> 02:11:56,950
This cannot be true! If it is then
why didn't you tell me before?

1313
02:11:57,523 --> 02:12:00,083
I tried to tell you
many times but you...

1314
02:12:00,526 --> 02:12:02,858
You have deceived me!
- Ravi, please listen to me!

1315
02:12:03,095 --> 02:12:05,928
You think that I will accept
a street performer...

1316
02:12:06,198 --> 02:12:10,066
who has no idea about her
lineage, as my wife?

1317
02:12:10,569 --> 02:12:12,127
But we are married!
- Shut up!

1318
02:12:22,548 --> 02:12:27,542
Aunty, I went to the temple,
she is not there!

1319
02:12:27,886 --> 02:12:30,548
She told me she's going to the
temple. -What happened, Cheena?

1320
02:12:30,923 --> 02:12:34,916
Geeta had gone to the temple 2
hours back but she's not traceable now!

1321
02:12:35,561 --> 02:12:38,223
It's ourwedding today
and where did she go?

1322
02:12:38,664 --> 02:12:40,564
I'll tell you!

1323
02:13:18,637 --> 02:13:20,867
''Oh yes...''

1324
02:13:21,874 --> 02:13:26,106
''I'm drunk''

1325
02:13:32,551 --> 02:13:38,547
''Not a little... I've had
more than I can remember''

1326
02:14:27,539 --> 02:14:30,030
''Please do forgive my misdemeanor''

1327
02:14:34,246 --> 02:14:40,981
''I can't help it...
my crazy heart isn't in my control''

1328
02:14:45,924 --> 02:14:52,557
''Stay away from me...
do not come closer''

1329
02:14:54,166 --> 02:14:59,160
''Oh yes, undoubtedly...''

1330
02:14:59,905 --> 02:15:05,502
''what I've had is surely evil''

1331
02:15:38,877 --> 02:15:41,539
''See the liquor in my hands?''

1332
02:15:45,651 --> 02:15:52,557
''But no one will notice
my shattered heart''

1333
02:15:57,496 --> 02:16:03,833
''Did anyone ask me
what poison I've had?''

1334
02:16:05,637 --> 02:16:10,836
''Oh yes, undoubtedly...''

1335
02:16:11,510 --> 02:16:16,846
''I say it cheerfully...
I'm quite drunk''

1336
02:16:17,516 --> 02:16:22,180
''Yes, I'm drunk on liquor''

1337
02:16:22,754 --> 02:16:28,124
''Not a bit, I've had more
than I can remember''

1338
02:16:38,203 --> 02:16:40,535
Why did you do this, Seeta?

1339
02:16:43,675 --> 02:16:49,545
Grandmother, I cannot get married!

1340
02:16:53,552 --> 02:16:57,921
Mr. Badrinath, did you call us
here to humiliate us?

1341
02:16:58,924 --> 02:17:03,725
If she did not want to get married
then why did you put up this act?

1342
02:17:04,296 --> 02:17:06,491
I'll tell you
why she put up this act?

1343
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:13,494
She did it because, she is
a very greedy person!

1344
02:17:13,906 --> 02:17:17,501
She did it because, she was eying
the wealth of this family!

1345
02:17:17,910 --> 02:17:20,504
She eyed the property
of this family!

1346
02:17:21,547 --> 02:17:24,539
What nonsense are you saying?
- I am stating the facts!

1347
02:17:25,017 --> 02:17:30,011
This girl, whom you'll
consider as Seeta...

1348
02:17:30,522 --> 02:17:37,086
she is a look alike of Seeta
and a street performer, Geeta!

1349
02:17:37,996 --> 02:17:40,863
This is a lie!
- This is the truth!

1350
02:17:43,869 --> 02:17:46,133
And this is a bitter truth!

1351
02:17:47,239 --> 02:17:51,232
For you as well as me!
-Who are you?

1352
02:17:52,978 --> 02:17:55,811
Ask her who am I!

1353
02:17:58,150 --> 02:18:02,484
Tell them who I am or is it
that you don't recognize me?

1354
02:18:04,489 --> 02:18:08,482
I never imagined that the greed of
wealth could make you stoop so low!

1355
02:18:09,494 --> 02:18:12,930
You pretended to be in love with me
and cheated this gentleman here!

1356
02:18:13,599 --> 02:18:16,227
You promised to marry me and...
- No, this is not true!

1357
02:18:16,835 --> 02:18:19,827
I did not make any promise!

1358
02:18:20,606 --> 02:18:23,837
Ravi, don't believe his words,
this is a lie!

1359
02:18:24,509 --> 02:18:27,910
Is it a lie that
your name is Geeta?

1360
02:18:28,513 --> 02:18:30,845
Is it a lie that you a girl
who performs on the streets?

1361
02:18:31,516 --> 02:18:33,507
Is it a lie that we were
supposed to get married today?

1362
02:18:33,852 --> 02:18:36,082
And is it a lie that
this woman is your mother?

1363
02:18:36,321 --> 02:18:39,518
Child, where did you go away?

1364
02:18:39,925 --> 02:18:43,520
I was very worried about you,
why did you go away from home?

1365
02:18:43,862 --> 02:18:45,193
Tell me, Geeta.

1366
02:18:45,530 --> 02:18:47,521
She's not your daughter,
she's our child, Seeta!

1367
02:18:47,733 --> 02:18:51,533
You think I am blind that I will
not recognize my own daughter?

1368
02:18:51,870 --> 02:18:55,863
I think you have misunderstood!
- No, I have not!

1369
02:18:56,208 --> 02:18:59,541
Child, tell them all
that I am your mother!

1370
02:19:06,318 --> 02:19:09,617
Hey! Why are you quiet?
Why don't you speak?

1371
02:19:12,758 --> 02:19:15,693
Oh, my! I hope they have not done
some black magic on you!

1372
02:19:17,195 --> 02:19:21,291
Geeta, tell them
that I am your mother!

1373
02:19:25,737 --> 02:19:31,903
Have you forgotten me?
Geeta, speak up!!

1374
02:19:32,577 --> 02:19:33,566
Mother!

1375
02:19:38,050 --> 02:19:40,314
Mother, please don't cry!

1376
02:19:41,920 --> 02:19:43,911
I am your Geeta!

1377
02:19:47,592 --> 02:19:50,584
Then where is my Seeta?

1378
02:19:51,029 --> 02:19:54,521
Perhaps, she has abducted Seeta
and has hidden her somewhere.

1379
02:19:55,834 --> 02:19:58,632
Or perhaps, she must have
killed Seeta.

1380
02:19:59,771 --> 02:20:01,705
You rogue, scoundrel!!

1381
02:20:01,907 --> 02:20:02,896
Wait!

1382
02:20:06,545 --> 02:20:08,945
Is it true that your name is Geeta?
-Yes!

1383
02:20:09,281 --> 02:20:11,272
And even this is true that you've
been staying here as Seeta?

1384
02:20:11,550 --> 02:20:12,539
Yes!

1385
02:20:12,718 --> 02:20:16,882
In that case I will have to arrest
you for committing deceit and fraud!

1386
02:20:17,556 --> 02:20:18,818
Come on!

1387
02:20:27,032 --> 02:20:31,731
Grandmother, if possible,
please forgive me!

1388
02:20:32,037 --> 02:20:33,902
Don't touch me!

1389
02:20:37,275 --> 02:20:39,573
If a lie is spoken
for a good cause...

1390
02:20:40,579 --> 02:20:43,571
then that one lie is equivalent
to many truths...

1391
02:20:46,251 --> 02:20:49,118
remember, you told me that!

1392
02:20:56,628 --> 02:20:59,756
Let's go, inspector!
-Wait!

1393
02:21:00,198 --> 02:21:02,962
Please don't take her,
she is not as you think!

1394
02:21:03,301 --> 02:21:05,861
Please leave her!

1395
02:21:07,873 --> 02:21:09,204
Someone please...

1396
02:21:43,909 --> 02:21:50,109
So the person whom we thought was
Geeta, was actually Seeta?

1397
02:21:51,583 --> 02:21:55,019
The person who loved me was
Seeta?!

1398
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:59,957
Yes and that is why,
everyone misunderstood Geeta!

1399
02:22:00,625 --> 02:22:02,855
Now the police has taken her!

1400
02:22:05,530 --> 02:22:10,866
You don't worry,
wherever Geeta is...

1401
02:22:11,303 --> 02:22:12,964
i will surely get her back!

1402
02:22:17,576 --> 02:22:20,136
Sir, Seeta is throwing a tantrum!
-What happened?

1403
02:22:20,612 --> 02:22:22,876
She has broken her head
against the wall!

1404
02:22:23,548 --> 02:22:25,539
Alright, you go and call
some doctor.

1405
02:22:39,564 --> 02:22:42,124
Did you see properly? Are you sure
It is the 2nd room on the 1st floor?

1406
02:22:42,567 --> 02:22:46,128
I am sure, I've just been released
from there this evening!

1407
02:22:47,172 --> 02:22:48,571
Alright, you go!

1408
02:23:22,974 --> 02:23:24,134
Raka, you?!

1409
02:24:42,921 --> 02:24:46,982
Doctor, without asking questions,
bandage this girl!

1410
02:24:47,559 --> 02:24:50,221
Alright!...Oh, you?!

1411
02:24:51,563 --> 02:24:54,498
How come you are here?
- These people have imprisoned me!

1412
02:25:00,505 --> 02:25:01,494
You?!

1413
02:25:02,507 --> 02:25:06,170
Idiots, didn't you find
any other doctor besides him?

1414
02:25:07,612 --> 02:25:12,174
Ranjit, I have understood
all your moves!

1415
02:25:12,851 --> 02:25:14,113
I will...

1416
02:25:17,522 --> 02:25:19,854
There is no need
to get angry, doctor.

1417
02:25:20,525 --> 02:25:26,191
Just do yourwork or my friends
will take you to task!

1418
02:25:30,201 --> 02:25:33,534
Wear this bridal attire
and come down quickly!

1419
02:25:34,539 --> 02:25:39,875
And as soon as finishes his work,
lock him up in the next room!

1420
02:25:57,829 --> 02:26:00,992
Raka, I don't understand why you...
- Geeta, please forgive me!

1421
02:26:01,499 --> 02:26:04,491
I did not know the truth infact,
even you are not aware of the truth!

1422
02:26:04,903 --> 02:26:07,895
What do you mean?
- Seeta is your twin sister!

1423
02:26:08,506 --> 02:26:10,167
My twin sister?! Who told you this?

1424
02:26:10,508 --> 02:26:12,499
Aunty told me that...
- But where is Seeta?

1425
02:26:12,610 --> 02:26:14,202
I know it!
-Where is she?

1426
02:26:14,512 --> 02:26:16,503
Ranjit has locked her up
in Plaza Cottage!

1427
02:26:17,515 --> 02:26:19,506
Come on!
- There are Ranjit's men all around.

1428
02:26:19,918 --> 02:26:25,788
So what, I can fight any
monster to save my sister!

1429
02:26:28,259 --> 02:26:30,227
How long will it take?
- Few minutes more!

1430
02:26:30,528 --> 02:26:32,860
Damodar, where did you get
this old hag from?

1431
02:26:35,867 --> 02:26:38,028
O God, what shall I do now?

1432
02:26:41,206 --> 02:26:45,267
Don't worry Seeta, God has
sent me here to protect you!

1433
02:26:47,011 --> 02:26:50,242
Who are you?

1434
02:26:50,882 --> 02:26:54,818
Don't look so surprised Seeta,
I am not a stranger...

1435
02:26:55,487 --> 02:26:59,184
I am your twin sister, Geeta!

1436
02:27:00,492 --> 02:27:04,485
My twin sister?! But...
- I will explain everything to you.

1437
02:27:05,497 --> 02:27:07,988
But before that, I need to explain
few things to the scoundrels...

1438
02:27:08,500 --> 02:27:10,491
who have put you in this state!

1439
02:27:10,735 --> 02:27:16,935
Ranjit wants to forcibly marry me!
- He cannot even touch you!

1440
02:27:17,876 --> 02:27:24,509
Seeta, trust me and
quietly do as I say!

1441
02:27:25,116 --> 02:27:27,516
Why are you delaying so much,
how long will it take?

1442
02:27:27,852 --> 02:27:30,514
Everything is ready,
you call for the bride.

1443
02:27:30,855 --> 02:27:33,187
Go and get Seeta, you start!

1444
02:27:35,860 --> 02:27:40,797
Come down quickly!
- Please have mercy on me!

1445
02:27:41,533 --> 02:27:44,525
I can't have mercy on anyone,
come on!

1446
02:27:44,903 --> 02:27:46,894
Where are you taking me?
- Come on!

1447
02:28:14,499 --> 02:28:16,160
How did you come here?

1448
02:28:19,904 --> 02:28:21,166
Let's go!

1449
02:28:25,977 --> 02:28:29,071
What joke is this?
- Idiot!

1450
02:28:30,014 --> 02:28:33,506
A lioness cannot marry a wolf!

1451
02:28:33,818 --> 02:28:36,184
What did you say?
I'll fix you right away!

1452
02:28:39,123 --> 02:28:42,923
You?!
-Yes, it's me!

1453
02:28:44,529 --> 02:28:47,089
Then where is Seeta?
- Seeta is here!

1454
02:28:48,533 --> 02:28:53,129
Hey! You are here?!
-Yes, I am here!

1455
02:28:54,539 --> 02:28:55,870
Get them!!

1456
02:30:17,021 --> 02:30:19,012
Wait a minute! Give that to me!

1457
02:30:23,661 --> 02:30:26,653
Let me check you! Breathe heavily!

1458
02:30:29,567 --> 02:30:34,004
You blockhead! You have asthma
and you want to fight, sit down!

1459
02:30:34,572 --> 02:30:37,234
Hey, shorty! What's your problem?
- I am constipated, doctor!

1460
02:30:37,575 --> 02:30:40,169
Lift your shirt...now you can go!

1461
02:30:49,587 --> 02:30:55,526
Don't you'll have any problem?
- Shut up! Come along with us!

1462
02:30:58,529 --> 02:31:00,190
Go, get her!

1463
02:31:14,212 --> 02:31:16,203
Take them all and tie them up!

1464
02:31:17,548 --> 02:31:19,209
Take them quickly!

1465
02:31:37,835 --> 02:31:39,826
Very good, my brave men!

1466
02:31:45,676 --> 02:31:50,579
Now you'll know who is a lion
and who is a wolf!

1467
02:31:55,653 --> 02:32:01,717
Hey! Tell your men that
the king of lions has come!

1468
02:32:02,260 --> 02:32:05,525
What are you seeing, go get him!

1469
02:32:12,303 --> 02:32:14,863
Come, let me bash you up!!

1470
02:32:31,823 --> 02:32:34,257
Take this now!

1471
02:35:41,545 --> 02:35:43,240
You are back again?
Are you fine now?

1472
02:35:43,547 --> 02:35:45,139
Yes, sir! - Did you go?
- Twice.

1473
02:35:45,249 --> 02:35:47,717
Go once again, where is the
bathroom? - This side!

1474
02:35:57,261 --> 02:36:00,822
Don't worry Ranjit, I don't
attack unarmed people.

1475
02:36:02,033 --> 02:36:03,500
Take this!

1476
02:36:04,568 --> 02:36:08,834
What are you seeing? If you have
the guts then pick up the sword!

1477
02:36:09,206 --> 02:36:11,197
Come on, pick it up!

1478
02:39:26,570 --> 02:39:29,562
Doctor, I've never been scared
of anything in till date.

1479
02:39:30,574 --> 02:39:32,565
But I wonder why,
I am very scared today!

1480
02:39:32,910 --> 02:39:35,242
There is nothing to fear!

1481
02:39:35,913 --> 02:39:39,076
Doctor, what does one do
on the nuptial night?

1482
02:39:39,583 --> 02:39:41,574
How would I know,
it's my first marriage too!

1483
02:39:41,919 --> 02:39:43,910
Oh, I see!
-Why are you so surprised?

1484
02:39:44,255 --> 02:39:46,587
It's really my first marriage!
-You go, don't worry!

1485
02:39:46,857 --> 02:39:48,848
Alright, as God wills!
-Just a minute!
