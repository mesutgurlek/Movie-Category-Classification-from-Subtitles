<i>On the day I was born</i>

00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,468
<i>Said me father, said he</i>

00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,828
<i>''I've an elegant legacy</i>
<i>Waiting for ye</i>

<i>And a song for your heart</i>

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,715
<i>To sing it whenever</i>
<i>The world falls apart''</i>

6
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,354
<i>Look, look</i>
<i>Look to the rainbow</i>

7
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,953
<i>Follow it over</i>
<i>The hill and stream</i>

8
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,838
<i>Look, look</i>
<i>Look to the rainbow</i>

9

<i>Follow the fellow</i>
<i>Who follows a dream</i>

10
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,196
<i>'Twas a sumptuous gift</i>
<i>To bequeath to a child</i>

11
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,754
<i>For the lure of that song</i>
<i>Keeps me head runnin' wild</i>

12
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,875
<i>'Tis a rhyme for me lip</i>
<i>And a song for me heart</i>

13
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,797
<i>And I sing it whenever</i>
<i>The world falls apart</i>

14
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,795
<i>Look, look</i>
<i>Look to the rainbow</i>

15
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,870
<i>Follow it over</i>
<i>The hill and stream</i>

16
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,790
<i>Look, look</i>
<i>Look to the rainbow</i>

17
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,677
<i>Follow the fellow</i>
<i>Who follows a dream</i>

18
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,275
<i>So I bundled me heart</i>
<i>And I roamed the world free</i>

19
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,156
<i>To the East with the light</i>
<i>To the West with the sea</i>

20
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,673
<i>And I searched all the earth</i>
<i>And I scanned all the skies</i>

21
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,319
<i>But I found it at last</i>
<i>In my own true love's eyes</i>

22
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,039
<i>Look, look</i>
<i>Look to the rainbow</i>

23
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,480
<i>Follow it over</i>
<i>The hill and stream</i>

24
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,834
<i>Look, look</i>
<i>Look to the rainbow</i>

25
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,599
<i>Follow the fellow</i>

<i>Who follows a dream</i>

29
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,358
Eureka!

30
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,950
-Sharon, come quickly.
-What is it now, Father?

31
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,516
We're here. lt's journey's end.
Our destination at last.

32
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,358
Thank heaven. Now l can sit down.

33
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,155
No, you can't sit you down.
lt's the hill beyond yon hill.

34
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,194
l've been hearing about the hill beyond
yon hill ever since we left Ireland.

35
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,992
Keep your distance. Don't crowd around.
Clear the way.

36
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,317
-Step aside.
-What's going on here?

37
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,751
-They're gonna have an auction.
-A what?

38
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,915
They're gonna have it today.

39
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,440
You gonna get this auction
started now or ain't you?

40
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,677
Hear ye! Hear ye!

41
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,713
Now, wait a minute!

42
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,799
You can't have an auction without first
talking to Susan Mahoney.

43
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,072
-Why not?
-Henry, go get Susan.

44
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,999
Because her brother owns this property,
that's why not.

45
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,315
I beg your pardon.

46
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,798
The law states this property belongs
to anybody who can pay the back taxes.

47
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,468
-And that's me.
-You mean, Senator Rawkins has it.

48
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,877
-You're just his stooge.
-And Woody don't like stooges.

49
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,957
-Who's Woody?
-He's Susan's brother.

50
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,469
He's nothing but a troublemaking
con man.

51
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,272
He is not. Woody's president...

52
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,234
...and general sales manager of the
Rainbow Valley Tobacco Cooperative.

53
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,192
Incorporated.

54
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,118
-What's that?
-Us!

55
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,912
-They're sharecroppers.
-Sure are.

56
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,111
That's how we'll all get rich together.

57
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,551
Woody promised me personally.

58
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,233
-Susan's trying to tell you something.
-I'm listening.

59
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,874
-What she say, Henry?
-She says Woody's coming.

60
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,877
-Woody.
-Woody?

61
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,277
-l didn't hear her say anything.
-Naturally, she was born silent.

62
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,072
One of the few women ever was.

63
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,795
Sure, mister. She don't do ''talk'' talk.
She does foot talk.

64
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,276
Foot talk? That's ridiculous.

65
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,472
-What's she saying now?
-She says you gotta wait for Woody.

66
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,272
He's bringing the money.

67
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,993
Quiet!

68
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,069
-Tax sale gonna start now.
-lt's all right. Woody's coming.

69
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,398
Woody's coming.

70
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,876
Woody's coming. Woody's coming.
Woody's coming.

71
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,312
It's my duty to protect the people
of Rainbow Valley.

72
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,917
-Who from?
-From the people of Rainbow Valley.

73
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,191
Hear ye, hear ye.

74
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,516
We can't be bothered
with the mortgage man--

75
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,994
<i>This time of the year!</i>

76
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,555
You'll be sorry interfering
with the law.

77
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,751
<i>For spring don't care</i>
<i>About the mortgage man</i>

78
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,439
<i>This time of the year</i>

79
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,632
I'm giving you your last chance
to get back your land.

80
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,799
<i>The dandelions in the dusky dell</i>
<i>Don't give a hoot in hell</i>

81
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,675
<i>-They're gonna smell without collateral</i>
<i>-This time of the year</i>

82
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,075
<i>-This time</i>
<i>-This time of the year</i>

83
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,474
<i>-Sweet merry buds and elderberry buds</i>
<i>-Don't give a good ding-ding-dang</i>

84
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,910
<i>Corn's shooting up</i>
<i>Fruit trees a-fruitin' up</i>

85
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,076
<i>Go tell Rawkins to go hang-hang</i>

86
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,997
<i>Don't mess around here</i>

87
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,112
<i>This time of the year</i>

88
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,756
<i>You'll get it in the rear</i>

89
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,797
<i>This time of the year</i>

90
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,988
<i>Magnolia's are sentimental</i>
<i>Persimmons are queer</i>

91
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,670
Keep your distance, now.
Give way, there.

92
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,838
You hear me? l said, keep your distance.

93
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,871
<i>Don't easily skeer</i>

94
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,079
<i>They sprout without real-estaters</i>
<i>This time of the year</i>

95
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,150
<i>That choo-choo's comin'</i>
<i>And it's mighty clear</i>

96
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,237
<i>Woo, woo, Woody's here</i>

97
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,069
<i>He's up there ridin' with the engineer</i>
<i>Yes, Woody's here</i>

98
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,952
<i>Just look at that choo-choo puffin'</i>
<i>Let's give it a mighty cheer</i>

99
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,153
<i>Just look at that engine huffin'</i>
<i>Dang blast it all, Woody's here</i>

100
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,476
<i>Woody's here!</i>

101
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,639
<i>Get a load of that whistle blowin'</i>
<i>That whistle is good to hear</i>

102
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,038
<i>It's wantin' you to be knowin'</i>
<i>Dang blast it all, Woody's here</i>

103
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,117
<i>Woody's here!</i>

104
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,792
<i>Woody's here!</i>

105
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,789
And to think l let you whisk me
out of lreland...

106
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,070
...across an ocean
and down a continent...

107
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,193
...in the sweet, green month of April.
And for what?

108
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,789
For a beautiful new life
in a beautiful new land.

109
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,356
-We came here to cure your arthritis.
-Aye, that too. That too.

110
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,791
Well, it's me that's cured
of your arthritis.

111
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,675
lt's all mythical, and so is that cure place
for it called Rainbow Valley.

112
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,110
Now you've gone just a bit too far.

113
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,074
Here l have it on me map, witnessed
and endorsed by Rand and McNally.

114
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,317
l don't know who Rand is,
but l could never trust a McNally.

115
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,318
But you can always trust a McLonergan.

116
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,310
Behold, that mythical land
called Rainbow Valley.

117
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,399
Sharon, shake hands with a millionaire.

118
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,352
-A millionaire?
-A multimillionaire.

119
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,836
-Now what's happened to your arthritis?
-That's for the poor.

120
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,079
l knew you were up to something. Now,
will you stand still and listen to me?

121
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,918
l can't. l can't. Oh, no.

122
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,032
Ever since l was 2,
you've been seeing leprechauns...

123
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,151
...and rainbows over your whiskey jug.

124
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,672
Now, what pixified fancy of yours
has really brought us to America, huh?

125
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,155
You'll love it here. You'll have everything
you left behind in Glocca Morra.

126
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,597
You hear that?

127
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,991
What did l tell you? The same
skylark music we have back in lreland.

128
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,918
-Aye, a Glocca Morra skylark.
-Aye.

129
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,991
<i>I hear a bird</i>

130
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,959
<i>A Glocca Morra bird</i>

131
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:47,712
<i>It well may be he's bringin' me</i>
<i>A cheerin' word</i>

132
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,039
<i>I hear a breeze</i>

133
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,150
<i>A River Shannon breeze</i>

134
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:03,078
<i>It well may be</i>
<i>It's followed me across the seas</i>

135
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:10,029
<i>Then tell me please</i>

136
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,556
<i>How are things in Glocca Morra?</i>

137
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,635
<i>Is that little brook still leapin' there?</i>

138
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,430
<i>Does it still run down to Donny Cove</i>

139
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:31,717
<i>Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?</i>

140
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,678
<i>How are things in Glocca Morra?</i>

141
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,589
<i>Is that willow tree still weepin' there?</i>

142
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,592
<i>Does that laddie with the twinklin' eye</i>
<i>Come whistlin' by</i>

143
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,520
<i>And does he walk away</i>
<i>Sad and dreamy there</i>

144
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,430
<i>Not to see me there?</i>

145
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,512
<i>So I ask each weepin' willow</i>

146
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,471
<i>And each brook along the way</i>

147
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,714
<i>And each lad that comes a-whistlin'</i>

148
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,430
<i>''Too-ra-lay''</i>

149
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:28,396
<i>How are things in Glocca Morra...</i>

150
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:37,030
<i>... these fine days?</i>

151
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,679
Oh, now, Father, why are you crying?

152
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,678
Oh, it's that cheap lrish music.

153
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,671
Where is everybody?

154
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,834
-Hello?
-Hello?

155
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,755
Where are all the children?

156
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,718
What the devil?

157
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,955
<i>He's up there ridin' with the engineer</i>
<i>Yes, Woody's here</i>

158
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,035
Someone's coming. You better get up
in that tree and take a look.

159
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,752
<i>Don't easily skeer</i>
<i>They'll sprout without real-estaters</i>

160
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,598
<i>This time of the year</i>

161
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,871
lt's only the folk who live here.

162
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,270
America's full of gangsters, you know.

163
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,436
You said it was full of millionaires.

164
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,789
Don't argue.

165
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,956
<i>Can't be bothered</i>
<i>With the mortgage man</i>

166
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,388
<i>This time of the year</i>

167
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,712
Here. Take this.

168
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,230
<i>The spring don't care</i>
<i>About the mortgage men</i>

169
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,953
<i>This time of the year</i>

170
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,996
lt's-- lt's gold.

171
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,677
-Aye. lt's a pot of gold.
-And you stole it.

172
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,235
-l never stole it. l borrowed it.
-But...

173
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,038
...who did you borrow it from?

174
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,800
-Why do you want to know?
-So we can lend it back.

175
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,036
-lt's impossible.
-Why not?

176
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,276
Because he's not mortal.

177
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,311
-You killed him.
-Of course not.

178
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,080
He never was mortal. He's a leprechaun.

179
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,359
A leprechaun?

180
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,915
Aye. Who else would have
gold in lreland?

181
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,676
<i>They sprout without real-estaters</i>
<i>This time of the year</i>

182
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,792

183
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,992
<i>Now that Woody's here</i>

184
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,597
<i>Now that Woody's here</i>

185
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,710
Now, don't think that this is gonna
stop the auction.

186
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,069
You gonna pay them off?

187
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,599
Hey, Howard. You watch me.

188
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,439
Hear ye! Hear ye!

189
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,551
You ain't making
a burlesque of the law.

190
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,354
Why not? That's where
the law spends most its time.

191
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,438
Seen him in the front row
last Monday night, Woody.

192
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,837
-Bet you did.
-Ain't true! Ain't true!

193
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,032
Quiet! This is an unlawful assembly.

194
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,277
Then this unlawful assembly
is gonna have to come to order.

195
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,629
All right.

196
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,188
Read it.

197
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,475
Read it.

198
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,437

205
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,276
Yeah. That's old Woody.

206
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,313

''Service charges, notary services...

Another $ 77.

211
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,113
No, it never said nothing about this
in that bill you sent to my sister Susan.

212
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,233
Well, that's how it is with interest.
Don't make a sound.

213
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,671
-Just keeps compounding.
-Ain't you got the balance of the money?

214
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,674
-l figure l'm good for it.
-Cash.

215
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,279
All right, come on, sheriff.

216
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,349
Wait a minute.

217
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,154
Give me a chance to get
my money back on this guitar.

218
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,396
lt's too late for that.

219
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,631
Money don't grow on trees, you know.

220
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,189
lt does for Woody.

221
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,038
Hey, Buzz, say hello to Rawkins!

222
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,869
Rawkins hears about this,
we'll both be looking for new jobs.

223
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,229
Come on, sheriff!

224
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,193
Well, now. What do we have here?

225
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,392
-lt's an angel.
-Shame on the frivolous likes of you.

226
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,828
lt's an lrish angel.

227
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,349
Your kith and kin pinning
their hopes on you...

228
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,313
...and you go squandering your money
on a music box.

229
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,793
l did it for them.

230
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,753
lt's a community guitar.

231
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,955
Aye, and l'm sure that's how
you'll use it...

232
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,071
...on every girl in the community.

233
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,273
Daughter, that's no way to be talking
to me future business partner.

234
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,629
Partner?

235
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,308
You accepted me money
for back taxes, didn't you?

236
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,159
-l intend to pay you back.
-l don't want you to.

237
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,271
l just want me property rights.

238
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,470
How much land you think
you're entitled to?

239
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,275
An acre or so. All l really need
is a parcel of land as big as me bag...

240
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,311
...on the closest point to Fort Knox.

241
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,954
We are in the vicinity of Fort Knox,
are we not?

242
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,388
About two miles.

243
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,478
ln fact, on a warm night,
you can smell the gold.

244
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,518
Have we a deal?

245
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,791
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

246
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,992
-lt's a deal.
-Then give me your hand, son.

247
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,475
-Welcome to Rainbow Valley...
-Hi.

248
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,114
...home of the most prosperous
tobacco company...

249
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,909
...in this state.
And l'll wager that.

250
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,918
What's your name?

251
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,191
Sharon McLonergan.

252
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,551
-Mine's Woody Mahoney.
-Mahoney. lt's fate.

253
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,157
How'd you get so pretty...

254
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,357
...and so rich?

255
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,953
You see, back in Glocca Morra where
we come from, there's an old legend.

256
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,513
And it says:

257
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,359
<i>You'll never grow old</i>
<i>And you'll never grow poor</i>

258
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,677
<i>If you look to the rainbow</i>
<i>Beyond the next moor</i>

259
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,711
-That's a lovely legend.
-Aye.

260
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,358
-Wonder who thought it up.
-Me father.

261
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,433
Finian McLonergan.

262
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,596
<i>On the day she was born</i>

263
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,797
<i>Said her father, said he</i>

264
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,028
<i>''I've an elegant legacy waiting for ye</i>

265
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,475
<i>'Tis a rhyme for your lip</i>

266
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,554
<i>And a song for your heart</i>

267
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,399
<i>To sing it whenever</i>
<i>The world falls apart</i>

268
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:08,319
<i>Look, look</i>
<i>Look to the rainbow</i>

269
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,714
<i>Follow it over</i>
<i>The hill and stream</i>

<i>Follow the fellow</i>
<i>Who follows a dream''</i>

272
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,069
<i>So I bundled me heart</i>
<i>And I roamed the world free</i>

273
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,717
<i>To the East with the lark</i>
<i>To the West with the sea</i>

274
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:40,109
<i>And I searched all the earth</i>
<i>And I scanned all the skies</i>

275
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:46,954
<i>But I found it at last</i>
<i>In my own true love's eyes</i>

276
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,280
<i>Look, look</i>
<i>Look to the rainbow</i>

277
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,276
<i>Follow it over</i>
<i>The hill and stream</i>

278
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,869
<i>Look, look</i>
<i>Look to the rainbow</i>

<i>Follow the fellow</i>

<i>Follow the fellow</i>

<i>Who follows a dream</i>

284
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,318
Bye.

285
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,152
Father?

286
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,709
Now, what would you be doing
up at this hour?

287
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,069
l'm taking care of you.

288
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,431
Any time the moon is full,
a McLonergan will be too.

289
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,119
You go back to bed.

290
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,679
Where are you going
with that bag and shovel?

291
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,836
Now, will you leave me be
if l tell you?

292
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,268
Aye.

293
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,272
Then let me ask you this.

294
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,117
What do you think makes America
different from lreland?

295
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,878
Has more lrishmen.

296
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,951
lt has more money.

297
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,918
Everyone in America is rich.

298
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,395
But, Father, are there
no poor in America?

299
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,750
No ill-housed and no ill-clad?

300
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:13,159
Of course. But they're the best ill-housed
and the best ill-clad in all the world.

301
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,191
Why? Why, l ask.

302
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,914
And there's no man with
wit enough to tell me.

303
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,157
So l'll tell you. Quote me self, quote.

304
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,433
Didn't the Americans rush to dig gold
from the ground in California in 1849?

305
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,789
So l've heard.

306
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,878
And didn't they plant it in the soil
at Fort Knox later?

307
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,513
-Granted.
-Well, that's it!

308
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,478
You see, there's something about
the soil in and around Fort Knox...

309
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,114
...that gives a magical quality to gold.

310
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,153
-Father--
-The gold radiates a powerful influence...

311
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,591
...throughout America.
lt activates assembly lines in Detroit...

312
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,951
...it makes skyscrapers sprout
from the gutters of New York...

313
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,039
...and it produces a bumper crop
of millionaires. And that...

314
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,669
...is the McLonergan theory
of economics.

315
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,992
And that's why we came
to America?

316
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,192
Aye. To bury me pot of gold.

317
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,789
Now, you go back to bed.
lt's a witching night.

318
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,352
Aye. Very scary place.

319
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,478
l'll.... l'll.... l'll....

320
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,428
One, two...

321
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,677
...four, five, six, seven, eight.

322
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,833
<i>Green is the color of the shamrock</i>

323
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,676
<i>And the grass on Blarney Hill</i>

324
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,232
<i>Oh, the darlin' green of Ireland</i>

325
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,995
<i>And the good old dollar bill</i>

326
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,918
God be with you.

327
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,875
God and Mary be with ye?

328
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,714
God, Mary and St. Patrick be with ye.

329
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,117
God, Mary, St. Patrick
and St. Ozymandias be with ye.

330
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,232
-Ozymandias? l never heard of him.
-He was a special saint.

331
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,711
He's the patron saint of
all the leprechauns of Glocca Morra.

332
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,831
-My name is Og.
-Og from Glocca Morra?

333
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,792
-Me native heath.
-Right.

334
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,317
You're an imposter. You can't be
a leprechaun, you're too tall!

335
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,193
l know, and l'm getting taller!

336
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,829
l need your help, Mr. McLonergan.

337
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,510
-Me help?
-Aye.

338
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,836
That calls for a toast.

339
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,510
l rise to welcome you to America.

340
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,550
-How are things in Glocca Morra?
-Alas, alack and willy-wally.

341
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,910
l weep for Glocca Morra
and all lreland.

342
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,917
You weep? Why, what's happened?

343
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,635
A blight has fallen over lreland.

344
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:31,150
-The British are back.
-Never seen such a curse befall a folk...

345
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,638
...in all me 459 years.

346
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,630
Alas, poor lreland.

347
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,990
-Poor lreland.
-Poor lreland!

348
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,191
-Suffering lreland.
-Suffering lreland!

349
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,349
-The native land!
-Oh, me native land!

350
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,637
A fine lot of fairyfolk you are,
letting all this happen.

351
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,876
Why don't you wish it away.

352
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,517
We lost the power.

353
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,871
You mean you've gone and lost
the power to make wishes?

354
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,275
-Aye.
-What has lreland to live for now?

355
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,835
-Answer me that.
-Doom and gloom!

356
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,868
Doom and gloom!

357
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,759
-Who's the author of this foul outrage?
-A monster.

358
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,279
-A monster?
-Aye.

359
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,677
You mean the old flame-breathing type,
with the head of a dragon?

360
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,873
Oh, no. This is a tiny, wee monster.
He's about...

361
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,911
-...your size.
-Who is he?

362
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,439
Who is this monster?

363
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,871
Excuse me for pointing,
Mr. McLonergan, but it's you.

364
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,589
-Me?
-You brought the blight on yourself...

365
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,189
...when you stole our crock of gold!

366
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,113
The little crock that gives us
all the power to wish.

367
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,237
Don't be superstitious, it's bad luck!

368
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,477
-Give it back, Mr. McLonergan.
-How do you know l've got it?

369
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,797
Me magnetic feathers pointed you out
all the way from lreland.

370
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,753
Feathers, who's the culprit?

371
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,276
Oh, me arthritis!

372
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,436
Give it back, Mr. McLonergan,
before a great evil befalls you.

373
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,154
Can't you postpone your wishing
a couple of months?

374
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,557
Gold was never meant for mankind.

375
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,833
lt's a fairyland metal
that only fairyfolk can use.

376
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,552
ln the hands of a mortal,
it can only bring...

377
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,357
...doom and gloom.

378
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,028
Doom and gloom!

379
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,470
Doom and gloom.
Stop your wailing, leprechaun.

380
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,035
l've come to a decision.
l deny your existence.

381
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,435
-You're a figment of me imagination.
-l am?

382
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,478
To prove it, l'm going to walk
through you.

383
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,312
Step aside. There, what did l tell you?

384
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,596
This is dreadful.

385
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,473
-l don't exist.
-Of course not.

386
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,955
l'm always seeing things.
Ask me daughter.

387
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,236
But if l don't exist, how is it
l'm gradually becoming mortal?

388
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,437
-The saints preserve us. You are.
-Aye.

389
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,679
So are all the other little leprechauns
ever since you stole our crock of gold.

390
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,158
Look at me. Look!
lt's crept past me ankles already.

391
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,158
-Can't you hold out until the winter?
-l don't know.

392
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,113
l got a peculiar human feeling
in me thighs lately.

393
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,754
Your thighs? Don't let it
go any higher, man.

394
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,872
-Mary and Joseph, lreland's ruined.
-Father!

395
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,559
-Someone's coming.
-Me daughter.

396
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,317
And now that you're half mortal,
you're indecent. Here, here, take these.

397
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,756
Now, you heard me, now.

398
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,709
You take those clothes and--

399
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,633
Father!

400
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,910
Father!

401
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,679
Sharon!

402
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,674
Mr. McLonergan!

403
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,634
-Father!
-Sharon!

404
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,116
-Father!
-Sharon!

405
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,549
Mr. McLonergan!

406
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,718
-Father!
-What fools these mortals be.

407
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,589
-Mr.--
-Father--

408
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,151
Father!

409
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,117
Now, what's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?

410
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,197
Oh, it's you, Mr. Mahoney.

411
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,073
l was looking for me father.

412
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,791
Not too long ago...

413
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,117
...they find a girl in the forest
in the middle of the night...

414
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,878
...they'd think that she was...

415
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,159
...a witch.

416
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,317
ls that so? Well....

417
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,557
lf you'll excuse me, l--
l'll be saying good evening to you.

418
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,190
You're not afraid of the werewolves?

419
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,398
Werewolves?

420
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,552
Our valley has its legends too,
you know.

421
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,990
Haven't you noticed how strange
the sky looks?

422
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,195
lt is a trifle strange.

423
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,191
And look at the moon.

424
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,871
lt is a cold, full moon.

425
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,071
The legend of the valley:

426
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,875
When the sky is strange...

427
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,036
...and the moon is full...

428
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,234
...the werewolves prowl.

429
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,035
-Unless....
-Unless?

430
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,353
That's a complicated part,
and l know you're in a hurry.

431
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,269
Oh, no, Mr. Mahoney. l'd like to know
the complicated part of the legend.

432
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,994
lt's how to make yourself immune
from the werewolf.

433
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,077
Well, how would l be doing that?

434
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,439
Well...

435
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,199
...you have to stand very, very close
to the nicest, handsomest fellow around.

436
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,077
That must be you.

437
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,479
Must be.

438
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,392
Then you make yourself comfortable
on the grass.

439
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,319
Now, you blink your eyes twice...

440
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,318
...and keep them closed.

441
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,352
Now you say...

442
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,312
...''petrified parsley'' over and over,
real fast.

443
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,395
Petrified parsley, petrified parsley,
petrified parsley....

444
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,953
-Feel immune yet?
-No.

445
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,789
Petrified parsley, petrified parsley,
petrified parsley....

446
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,751
That's a lovely legend.

447
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,392
Who made it up?

448
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,075
l did.

449
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:55,115
<i>I look at you and suddenly</i>

450
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,429
<i>Something in your eyes I see</i>

451
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,710
<i>Soon begins bewitching me</i>

452
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,471
<i>It's that old devil moon</i>

453
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,198
<i>That you stole from the skies</i>

454
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,356
<i>It's that old devil moon</i>

455
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,916
<i>In your eyes</i>

456
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,955
<i>You and your glance</i>
<i>Make this romance</i>

457
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,238
<i>Too hot to handle</i>

458
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,272
<i>Stars in the night</i>
<i>Blazing their light</i>

459
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:45,590
<i>Can't hold a candle</i>
<i>To your razzle-dazzle</i>

460
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:51,716
<i>You got me flyin' high and wide</i>

461
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,159
<i>On a magic carpet ride</i>

462
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,711
<i>Full of butterflies inside</i>

463
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:08,040
<i>I wanna cry</i>
<i>Wanna croon</i>

464
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,917
<i>Wanna laugh</i>
<i>Just like a loon</i>

465
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:17,591
<i>It's that old devil moon</i>

466
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,795
<i>In your eyes</i>

467
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,874
<i>I look at you</i>

468
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,393
<i>And glory be</i>

469
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:39,758
<i>Something in your eyes I see</i>

470
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:46,277
<i>Soon begins bewitching me</i>

471
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,598
<i>It's that old devil moon</i>

472
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:56,073
<i>That you stole from the skies</i>

473
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:05,310
<i>It's that old devil moon</i>
<i>In your eyes</i>

474
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:11,870
<i>You and your glance make this romance</i>
<i>Too hot to handle</i>

475
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:18,548
<i>Stars in the night blazin' their light</i>
<i>Can't hold a candle</i>

476
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,950
<i>To your razzle-dazzle</i>

477
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,955
<i>You got me flyin' high and wide</i>

478
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,629
<i>On a magic carpet ride</i>

479
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,953
<i>Full of butterflies inside</i>

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,276
<i>I wanna cry</i>

481

<i>I wanna croon</i>

<i>It's that old devil moon</i>

00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:07,118
<i>Free as a dove</i>

487
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:12,475
<i>Old devil moon</i>
<i>Deep in your eyes</i>

488
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,519
<i>Blinds me with...</i>

489
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,234
<i>-...love</i>
<i>-Yeah</i>

490
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,869
-Howard, old buddy!
-Hey, Woody!

491
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,196
How's the Luther Burbank
of the swamp?

492
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,958
-Mr. Moneybags.
-How you doing?

493
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,310
l've been waiting for you.
Where you been?

494
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,590
Sharon, meet Howard.
Howard, this is Sharon.

495
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,836
How do you do? Nice to meet you.

496
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,198
Woody, l'm glad you're here.
l got the list all made out.

497
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:26,077
Fifty feet of styrene tubing, quarter inch,
250 pounds of nitrogen tripalminate--

498
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,829
The voice you hear is the voice
of the greatest research botanist today.

499
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,395
He's gonna change
our whole way of life...

500
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,637
...and he's gonna do it
with these little flowers right here.

501
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,274
-They're all his babies.
-We're doing it together.

502
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,915
Woody thought it up,
and l'm growing them up.

503
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,759
l ain't nothing but
a suede-shoe boy peddling tobacco.

504
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,428
But Howard--
Howard is the first man in history...

505
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,519
...to mate the mint plant with tobacco.
You realize what that means.

506
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,869
No.

507
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,110
You are looking at
the mentholated tobacco plant.

508
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,235
Here, smell.

509
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,757
Smell the mint-julep nicotine.

510
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,199
That's nice. Really smells lovely.

511
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,035
lt's a whole new form of tobacco life.

512
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,029
-lt only has one drawback.
-What's that?

513
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,590
Well, it doesn't burn.

514
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,753
lt doesn't burn?

515
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,632
lt's worse than asbestos.

516
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,229
lt actually puts fires out.
We're working on it.

517
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,589
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

518
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,157
Now that you're all back,
fat with cash...

519
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,798
...gotta get to work.
Once l rig the styrene tubing...

520
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,798
...l'll take the nitrogen tripalminate
in powdered form--

521
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,514
That's what l've been meaning
to talk to you about.

522
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,077
What's that? The styrene tubing or the
nitrogen tripalminate in powdered form?

523
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,511
-The cash.
-Yeah, what about the cash?

524
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,429
l got some great things going. l made
some contacts you wouldn't believe.

525
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,393
Wait, wait. Contacts? No cash?

526
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,999
Not a dime.

527
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,556
Well, you didn't bring back any cash,
l'll go out and get some.

528
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,553
How?

529
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,710
l'll get a job. Yeah.

530
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:25,677
But you've got a job, Howard.
That's to make it burn. Make it burn!

531
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,996
ls that dedication?

532
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,389
Mr. Mahoney?

533
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,719
You're going to make plenty
of money for everyone?

534
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,194
You bet.

535
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,755
Without doing a stitch of work for it?

536
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,234
Why not?

537
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,831
And is that what you call
the''Mahoney theory of economics''?

538
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,029
No, but that's a pretty good name for it.

539
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,919
Why don't you grow ordinary tobacco
that does burn?

540
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,997
Never get rich that way.

541
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,108
See you soon, Sharon.
Hey, Howard, buddy!

542
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,758
Don't take that personal. He's trained
to do that to anyone what ain't white.

543
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,230
-You're the new boy from the agency.
-Yeah.

544
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,431
Okay, Stonewall.

545
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,235
Ain't l seen you somewhere?

546
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,117
-You worked here as a butler, didn't you?
-Oh, no, no.

547
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,994
No, sir.

548
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,394
Well, you'll like working here, boy.

549
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:35,155
l've hired all of the senator's butlers
for the past 10 years.

550
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:39,751
Hundreds of them. Of course,
he's a little intolerant at times...

551
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,235
...but that's his blood pressure.

552
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,470
-What's your name?
-Howard.

553
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,355
Let me see you serve that julep.

554
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,196
Rawkins won't like that. That's no way
to serve a julep. lt's too fast.

555
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,755
Get some shuffle into it.

556
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,357
You've seen some of the new movies,
like <i>Birth of a Nation</i>...

557
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,790
...and <i>Gone With the Wind</i>, haven't you?

558
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,670
-Here, George, like this.
-Howard.

559
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,871
Yeah, okay, Jackson.

560
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,954
Your julep, sir. Master Rawkins, sir.

561
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,958
All frosted and minty....

562
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,958
You see, George?

563
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,355
Why do l have to shuffle?

564
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,870
Now, l don't have to explain that to you.

565
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:50,235
lt makes for kindly feelings
between employer and employee.

566
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,112
Once more, now. Try it again.
And not so fast this time.

567
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,032
How did you do that again?

568
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,197
l don't understand you, Jackson.

569
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,119
l mean, you don't walk or talk
like you're supposed to.

570
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,278
You don't know how to serve a julep
like you're supposed to.

571
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,959
You educated or something?

572
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,515
l'm working on my master's.

573
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,468
Working on your master's what?

574
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,152
lt's a college degree.

575
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:28,512
Now, don't mention the word''college''
around the senator. lt upsets him.

576
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,156
But that's beside the point.
Do you want a job here, or don't you?

577
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,238
Yes, sir, l do.

578
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,749
l needs the money.

579
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,872
Well, that's all the more reason
for you to make good here.

580
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,631
Then when you get your college degree,
why, you got a job here for life.

581
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,836
-Buzz!
-Oh, l'll speak to you later.

582
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,349
You go around back
and keep practicing, hear?

583
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,154
-Buzz, where are you?
-l'm over here, senator.

584
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,870
-l can't seem to see you.
-lt's these columns, senator.

585
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,355
-They sort of get in the way.
-Nonsense.

586
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,711
Those columns haven't
moved an inch in a hundred years.

587
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,399
Meet me down by the glider.

588
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,039
Yep. Fine job you done yesterday, Buzz...

589
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,233
-...buying up all that land.
-Yes, sir. Bought up the whole valley.

590
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,431
Except one little parcel.

591
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,430
That'll teach them bureaucrats to stay
where they belong, in Washington.

592
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,355
Cheap electric power.

593
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,558
Why don't they build their dam
on the Potomac...

594
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,433
...instead of desecrating
this heaven-given valley...

595
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,392
...with a lot of copper wire.

596
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:46,593
Electrocuting innocent bullfinches
and sparrows.

597
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,559
Gentlemen...

598
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,309
...the festering tides of radicalism
are upon us.

599
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,156
But before l yield up
our glorious South...

600
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,238
...and her sister commonwealth,
the U.S. of A...

601
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,031
...l will lay down my life.

602
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,152
l will do more than that. l will filibuster.

603
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,837
Back, you crackpots. Forward, America.

604
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:37,269
Forward to the hallowed principles
of our forefathers.

605
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:43,034
Forward to the sweet tranquility
of the status quo.

606
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,548
Forward to yesterday.

607
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,916
Get this dog off-- Get him off me.

608
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,078
Caught him dead to rights, senator.
Spank on your property.

609
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,875
Oh, damn it, sheriff, can't you arrest
a couple of chicken thieves...

610
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,275
...without disturbing
the whole countryside?

611
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,519
Worse than chicken thieves this time.
These are geologists from Washington.

612
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,677
Geologists?

613
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,079
Two?

614
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,993
-l only see one.
-Senator.

615
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,393
This is a geological survey of the soil
in this area in connection with the dam.

616
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,319
l don't need nobody to tell me
what's on my land.

617
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,351
Especially one of his kind.

618
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,994
Look, l read the findings on this meter.

619
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,873
lt detected gold on your property
this afternoon.

620
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,910
You found what on my property?

621
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,395
lt located an amazing
concentration of gold.

622
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,160
The meter reacted so violently,
it broke the needle.

623
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,636
We're sorry about that needle,
but we'll reimburse you. Now....

624
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,879
Just where did this unfortunate
needle-breaking accident occur?

625
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,192
Parcel lot number seven,
right outside Rainbow Valley.

626
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,710
-Oh, my God.
-What are you mumbling about, Buzz?

627
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,275
lnvite these gentlemen
up on the veranda.

628
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,074
lt isn't every day we're honored
with the presence...

629
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,113
...of two distinguished scientists
from Washington, D.C.

630
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,754
Sorry, senator,
we've got more ground to cover.

631
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,190
Gentlemen, l wish you'd accept
my hospitality.

632
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,913
Senator?

633
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,077
That was the strip l told you about.

634
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,272
-What strip?
-The one we couldn't buy.

635
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,678
Well, gentlemen, l'm sorry
you gotta rush off like this...

636
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,075
...but you hurry back
real soon, now, hear?

637
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,151
We couldn't buy it? Who bought it?

638
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,920
We found out it was a man
named Finian McLonergan.

639
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,395
Yankee brain!
Why weren't you prepared for him?

640
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,955
l never saw him before.
He's an immigrant.

641
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,594
My family's been having trouble
with immigrants...

642
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,315
-...ever since they come to this country!
-Don't you get excited!

643
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,397
You'll feel better when
you've had your julep.

644
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,910
To hell with my julep!
Get me a Bromo, quick.

645
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,278
Howard!

646
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:12,192
Howard! Bring the senator
a Bromo-Seltzer, quick!

647
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,995
And call my lawyer.
Tell him to find a loophole.

648
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,395
Where's that Bromo?

649
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:23,231
-Where's that Bromo, Howard?
-My loophole's choking me.

650
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,792
Where's that Bromo?

651
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,750
Coming, master. Coming.

652
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:34,795
l'm coming all in there, yes, sir.
Yeah, l'm coming.

653
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,390
Will you hurry up on that Bromo?!

654
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,591
You're gonna enjoy it
once l get to you.

655
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,509
-Get him his Bromo!
-Coming in there fast as l can.

656
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:49,589
-Will you hurry up with it?!
-Coming right there, fix your head good.

657
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:53,429
Mercy, sure gonna make you
feel like you flying.

658
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:57,474
-Please, please hurry up with the--
-Come on, Howard!

659
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,318
Come on!

660
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,875
Howard, come on!

661
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,073
-Please bring me my--
-Howard!

662
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,954
Oh, Lord, l'm coming in.

663
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,993
Howard! Come on, bring that!
Get over here!

664
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,037
<i>How are things in Glocca Morra?</i>

665
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,835
<i>Is that willow tree</i>
<i>Still weepin' there?</i>

666
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:31,310
<i>Does that laddie</i>
<i>With the twinklin' eye</i>

667
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,831
<i>Come whistlin' by</i>

668
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,550
<i>And does he walk away</i>

669
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,956
<i>Sad and dreamy there</i>

670
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,556
-Sharon!
-Aye?

671
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,991
-Haven't you laundered my shirt yet?
-lt's coming, it's coming.

672
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,470
<i>Not to see me there?</i>

673
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,552
Not so hard. You'll be wringing
the lrish out of the linen.

674
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,876
lt is the neck of the Mahoney
l'm wringing.

675
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,834
Oh, good, good, good. Lover's quarrel.
Healthy sign.

676
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,712
Are you sure?

677
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,958
l know true devotion when l see it.

678
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,948
l know a fine, upstanding darling
of a man when l see one.

679
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,430
He's leaving for parts unknown
this morning.

680
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,358
He's what? He's running out on you?

681
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:22,757
He's off to sell tobacco
that doesn't burn. He's a schemer.

682
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,394
-You're well rid of him.
-An impractical dreamer.

683
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,319
-lt's deplorable.
-Total no-good bounder.

684
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,715
Get the wretch out of your mind.

685
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,637
-He's just like you.
-Aye, a darling of a man.

686
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:38,674
Now, look. Now, just a minute.
Now, don't you be crying.

687
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,509
A special rose...

688
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,191
...for your hair.

689
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,149
lt has magical properties.

690
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,148
Beautiful bride you'll be.

691
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,588
All by myself, or is there a man involved?

692
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,552
Aye, there is.

693
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,556
He doesn't know it,
but before sundown...

694
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,116
...Mr. Woody Mahoney will find
himself betroth-ted to you.

695
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,198
''Betrothed.''

696
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,551
Betroth-ted!

697
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,711
<i>How are things</i>

698
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,557
<i>In Glocca Morra</i>

699
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,954
<i>This...</i>

700
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,671
<i>...fine....</i>

701
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,159
Well, this is a pretty bucket of fish.

702
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,590
How would you explain
these shenanigans?

703
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,837
-lf you won't speak, back into the well.
-Oh, no! No!

704
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,679
So you've found your tongue.
Speak up for yourself.

705
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,440
-Why were you hiding in that well?
-l wasn't hiding.

706
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,200
Someone set me on fire,
and l had to put myself out.

707
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,233
Oh, l see. Who was it
put the torch to you?

708
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,271
A sunbeam.

709
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:02,718
-A sunbeam?
-Sunbeam disguised as a fairy queen.

710
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:07,436
But you can't fool me.
l know a sunbeam when l see one.

711
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,153
Thank you.

712
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,995
-You're very poetical.
-Don't come too close!

713
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,236
l'll have to jump again!

714
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,599
l'm beginning to understand.

715
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,310
l've known that feeling myself.

716
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:24,877
-You have?
-Well, only recently.

717
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:29,679
Came over me this morning, as you
were sunning your hair by the brook.

718
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,359
ls it a warmish...

719
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:35,269
...kind of glowish,
kind of peculiarish sensation?

720
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:40,474
Oh, no, it's sort of a shiverish, kind of
quiverish, flibbertigibberish sensation.

721
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,911
-Do you feel hummingbirds in your heart?
-Butterflies in my feet.

722
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,678
-Bees in your bonnet?
-Stars in my britches.

723
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,791
Does it make you want to dance?

724
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,639
-l hadn't noticed.
-And sing?

725
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,512
Oh, it does, it does.

726
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,758
<i>Something sweet</i>

727

What was that splash?

754
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,119
'Twas me, singing a duet.

755
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,836
A duet? By yourself?

756
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,158
Well, it could be, you know.

757
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:39,511
After all, l'm a witch, remember?

758
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,552
Train's pulling out soon.

Well, goodbye.

-What kind of a goodbye is that?
-The best kind. Short, sweet and final.

762
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,715
How come l feel
you're losing interest in me?

763

-Losing? Losing?
-l'm going away so l can come back...

764

-...and make everybody rich!
-Lost!

765
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,319
Sharon.

766
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,710
<i>We're having a party</i>
<i>We're having a party</i>

767
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,717
<i>Oh, Finian's party we're having today</i>

768
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,388
<i>We're having a party</i>
<i>We're having a party....</i>

769
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,352
Hey, what's going on?

770
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:36,195
-What's the occasion, Mr. McLonergan?
-What? Haven't you heard the gossip?

771
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,119
Me daughter Sharon's
getting betroth-ted today.

772
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,793
Singing a duet with herself!

773
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:49,679
<i>Sharon's getting betroth-ted</i>
<i>Sharon is getting betroth-ted today</i>

774
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:52,838
<i>Sharon is getting betroth-ted....</i>

775
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,315
l hope you won't be taking it
too hard, son.

776
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:59,798
-But then you'll be leaving town anyhow.
-l got a deal cooking, Mr. McLonergan--

777
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,275
l understand when a man's got
a deal cooking.

778
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,596
He's got to cook it,
or it won't get cooked.

779
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:08,315
On the other hand, many deals
are cooked at home in your own pot...

780
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,673
...of gold.

781
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,877
-Gold?
-But then again...

782
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:17,551
...what is the cold, hard metal compared
to the golden hair of the girl you love?

783
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,753
-Nothing.
-You're right.

784
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:23,270
Then tell me, why are you
gallivanting all over the countryside...

785
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:27,837
...promoting and cooking deals when the
lady you fancy is to be betroth-ted?

786
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,871
Well, who's she gonna marry?

787
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,469
l hope you won't be after
taking it too hard.

788
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,352
Why should l? lt's only love.

789
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,391
-That's a sensible attitude.
-Right.

790
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,068
Wait a minute! Who's the guy?
Now, who is he?

791
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:43,590
Now, if l tell you,
you won't be making any trouble?

792
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,599
l promise.

793
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,559
Very well.

794
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,634
lt was last night she met him
in the forest...

795
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,870
...and they sang about the moon.

796
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,755
Mr. McLonergan, that was me.

797
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,071
-Well, was it, now?
-Yeah.

798
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,759
Are you sure?

799
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,837
Of course! lt was me all along.

800
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,508
Well, that's a blessed relief.

801
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:19,838
Therefore, it's you
that's getting betroth-ted today.

802
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,508
-''Betrothed.''
-Oh, yes, betrothed.

803
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,279
Finian McLonergan.

804
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,038
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

805
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,995
Susan's trying to tell us something.

806
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,351
-What's she saying?
-l can't tell. lt's a secret.

807
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,869
-Woody, you tell them.
-Okay.

808
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:45,516
<i>A secret, a secret</i>
<i>She says she's got a secret</i>

809
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:53,470
<i>A secret, a secret</i>
<i>A secret kind of secret</i>

810
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:56,998
<i>She's achin' for to shout it</i>
<i>To every daffodil</i>

811
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:02,075
<i>And tell the world about it</i>
<i>In fact, she says she will</i>

812
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,352
<i>-She says</i>

<i>If this isn't love</i>
<i>The whole world is crazy</i>

814
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:17,717
<i>If this isn't love</i>
<i>I'm daft as a daisy</i>

815
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:24,830
<i>With moons all around</i>
<i>And cows jumpin' over</i>

816
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:30,480
<i>There's something amiss</i>
<i>And I'll eat my hat if this isn't love</i>

817
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:35,030
<i>I'm feeling like the apple</i>
<i>On top of William Tell</i>

818
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,719
<i>With this I cannot grapple</i>

819
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:38,319
<i>-Because</i>
<i>-Because</i>

820
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,033
<i>You're so adora-bell</i>

821
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:45,268
<i>If this isn't love</i>
<i>Then winter is summer</i>

822
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:46,435
<i>Give in to summer</i>

823

<i>-It needs a plumber</i>

825
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:59,475

<i>And ridin' on rainbows</i>

826
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:05,750

<i>If this isn't love</i>

828
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:18,830
<i>If this isn't love</i>

829
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:25,470

830
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:31,677
<i>Will you hear a hiss</i>

831
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:35,592

<i>And stickin' to the rules</i>

832
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:40,749
<i>This feelin' calls for matin'</i>

McLonergan!

841
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:29,269
How dare you come back here? Didn't l
tell you you're an optical delusion?

842
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:32,517
l was ready to believe you yesterday,
but not today.

843
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,836
-Today l've got proof.
-What proof?

844
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:39,318
Does an optical illusion feel such a
hungry yearning, burning inside of him?

845
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,557
Does an optical illusion feel
the beat of the tom-tom...

846
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,274
...in the roaring traffic's
boom in his lonely room?

847
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:47,994
You flying high and wide on a
magic-carpet ride...

848
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:49,679
...full of butterflies inside?

849
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:52,792
Aye, and what's worse,
smoke keeps coming out of me eyes.

850
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,514
You go round
like an elevator lost in the tide?

851
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:59,030
That's the feeling!
Day and night, night and day!

852
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,719
Give me your daughter.

853
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,878
-What's she got to do with it?
-She's the one under my skin.

854
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,755
-Leprechaun, you're playing with fire.
-l know, and the fire's winning!

855
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:12,109
l don't wanna be human.
l don't wanna be human.

856
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,311
-lt's too inhuman.
-You're neurotic.

857
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:18,399
-Who's forcing you to be human?
-You are, by keeping my crock of gold!

858
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,559
l'm only lend-leasing it. Give me a few
weeks and l'll return it with interest.

859
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,273
Five and a quarter little crocks.

860
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,710
l hope you're not using it
to make wishes.

861
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:31,277
ln the hands of a mortal it's only good
for three, and after it becomes dross.

862
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:35,359
The way you talk, anyone would think
l never had a pot to wish on.

863
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:38,552
l'm sorry, Mr. McLonergan.
l'm being a nuisance.

864
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,920
You're damn right you are!
You're worse than that!

865
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:46,715
You're the nemesis on me premises.
You're endangering me whole project.

866
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,717
-Where's your passport?
-What's that?

867
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:52,515
l thought so. How dare you come into
a free country without a passport?

868
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,439
l'm legal, all right.
l came in as a Christmas tree.

869
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,596
But l'm not leaving
till l see me crock!

870
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:01,910
And l'm seeing me congressman,
Senator Rawkins...

871
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,678
...and l'm having you deported!

872
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,752
You're a member
of a subversive, underground group...

873
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,831
...taking its orders from Dublin!

874
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:22,078
<i>Woody's gettin' betroth-ted</i>
<i>Woody is gettin' betroth-ted today</i>

875
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,230
Hey, mister, did you see our rooster?

876
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,715
l got enough troubles
of me own, thank you.

877
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,751
What kind of a rooster was he?

878
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,156
-He had pink--
-Green feet--

879
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,396
-And a yellow--
-Wait a minute. Wait!

880
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,909
-How many roosters did you lose?
-One!

881
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,157
-One rooster, all those colors?
-Yeah!

882
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,669
Well, now, let me see, now.

883
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,511
-Would this be it?
-Yeah!

884
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:59,432
-He must be magic!
-That's right! You get the prize.

885
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:03,679
-Do you do other magical things too?
-l do, but we'll have to act very quickly.

886
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:06,917
-l need your help. Will you help me?
-Yeah!

887
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:10,590
Now, listen. Somewhere hidden
in the ground around here...

888
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,392
...is a little yellow crock.

889
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,717
lf any of you find it for me,
you can pick anything you like...

890
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,911
...here in me little magic book.

891
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,714
That's nothing!
We all have one of those.

892
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:25,357
Yes, but the difference is, from mine
you can have anything you choose.

893
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,835
-Can l have a banjo?
-Can l get a fishing rod?

894
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,918
-Can l have an elephant?
-You can have anything you like...

895
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,429
-...that's made in fairyland.
-Without money?

896
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,276
<i>There'll be things</i>

908
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:22,116
<i>There'll be chocolate custish</i>
<i>With hot dogs and mustish</i>

909
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:25,710
<i>But Shears and Robustish</i>
<i>Must firstish come through</i>

910
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,398
You folks belong here?

911
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,079
Yeah.

912
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,874
You mean you all live here
on this property together?

913
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,074
-Yeah.
-This is my property, Your Honor.

914
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,153
McLonergan.

915
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,470
Now, Mr. Lonergan,
l understand you got stuck...

916
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:21,515
...with this here arid, gopher-infested
property a couple of days ago.

917
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:26,396
How would you like to unload it for,
say, a profit of 30 percent?

918
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,592
-lt's the McLonergan theory giving birth.
-What do you say?

919
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,314
l couldn't consider any propositions
for six months.

920
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:35,159
You see, l'm conducting
certain experiments.

921
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:38,670
Now, let me ask you, sir,
just what kind of experiments?

922
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,917
Well, you see, Father is a mineralogist
from the old country.

923
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,190
He can make gold sprout
out of the ground.

924
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,437
Gold? There ain't no gold in lreland.

925
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:51,269
l myself discovered a vein our
countrymen have been searching for...

926
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,755
...since the reign
of Alfred the Thoughtless.

927
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,154
Who?

928
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:58,598
You never heard
of Alfred the Thoughtless?

929
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:03,069
Well, he was King of Erin, following
his father, Thomas the Temporary...

930
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:07,512
...who in turn was the only son
of the virgin queen, Serena the Spotless.

931
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:10,393
Are you willing to sell this land
or ain't you?

932
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:14,991
l'm willing and l'm wanting,
but l'm waiting.

933
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:18,238
l'm sorry you said that.
lt'll put me to the trouble...

934
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,954
...of issuing a writ of seizure
on all this land.

935
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:24,277
-Here's the writ, senator.
-Now, don't be crude, Buzz.

936
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:27,115
l hate to do this to you...

937
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,160
-...but you've been violating the law.
-Since when?

938
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:35,670
This afternoon.
l just finished drafting this.

939
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,517
''Local ordinance number 7428.

940
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:44,630
Be it known that in the county
of Rainbow Valley...

941
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:49,675
...it is a felony for members of the
Caucasian and Negro races--''

942
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:53,031
lt would seem to me that this law
could not be a legal law.

943
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:57,392
Of course it's legal! l don't know where
you immigrants get these foreign ideas.

944
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,716
From a book
the immigration officer gave us.

945
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:03,310
-Called the United States Constitution.
-Haven't you read it?

946
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:07,195
l don't have time to read it,
l'm too busy defending it!

947
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:08,549
l rest me case.

948
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:12,116
l wish you folks would understand
our traditions. l wish--

949
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,278
Now, don't get in the habit of
making wishes on me property!

950
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:18,153
lt's not your property.
l'll thank you to get off it.

951
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,874
And take your black friends with you.

952
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,196
-l don't wanna go!
-Shush, Henry.

953
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:27,313
You're saying you're taking this land
from these people because they're black?

954
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,636
-Don't let them chase us!
-Shut this kid up.

955
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:33,310
He's making me look like a bully.
Sheriff, get them out of here!

956
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:37,798
You heard the senator. You folks
better start packing your things.

957
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,391
ls Henry the wrong color?

958
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,592
No, of course not.
He's the right color.

959
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,030
But there's something wrong
with the world.

960
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:51,149
-l wish--
-Sharon! Sharon!

961
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,989
There's something wrong with the world
you've made for people like Henry!

962
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,920
l wish you could know
what that world is like.

963
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:02,157
l wish to God you were black!

964
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,511
l'm a son of a biscuit.

965
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,675
Oh, my God! What happened?

966
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,793
-Stonewall!
-Somebody get a doctor!

967
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:42,034
Father, what have l done?

968
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,959
You shouldn't go around me property
making wishes.

969
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:01,199
Hey, sorry, buddy,
but it's that great come-and-get-it day!

970
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:10,070
-What's going on?
-The senator tried to take our land away.

971
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,953
Then l lost me temper with him,
and l shouted at him...

972
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,878
...and he turned black!

973
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:18,868
Don't worry. That happens every time
he meets somebody he disagrees with.

974
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:22,709
He sees red, turns purple with rage
and yells himself black in the face.

975
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,275
But we don't need to
worry about him anymore.

976
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:28,631
We don't have to worry about
anything anymore. We got good news!

977
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,990
-A telegram for Finian.
-For me?

978
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,394
-Let me see it!
-Oh, no.

979
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,397
This is a singing telegram.

980
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:41,230
''Dear sir, after investigating your
standing in the community...

981
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:44,955
...and finding you to be a citizen
of high character...

982
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:50,673
...we have taken the liberty of opening
an unlimited charge account...

983
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,555
...for you and your associates.''

984
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:59,197
Signed,''Shears Robust Company.''

985
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:05,193
lt says,''P.S. We hear gold...

986
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:08,312
...has been discovered
on your property. Congratulations!''

987
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:10,158
Gold?

988
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,396
-Must be a mistake here!
-Mistake?

989
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:17,273
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, what about this here?

990
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,311
Hey, come on, hurry up!

991
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,671
Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Didn't you hear the telegram?

992
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,871
We got credit! Wait!

993
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,799
Credit! Hold it,
you're gonna dig up this whole valley.

994
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,195
l've waited all my life
for a break like this.

995
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,549
Yeah, but....

996
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,752
Don't you see,
don't you know what credit means?

997
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:38,190
Credit means we can buy
ourselves a tractor.

998
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:41,517
We can get ourselves a new
planting machine, some tools...

999
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:43,995
...we can get laboratory equipment
for Howard.

1000
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,395
We can get our
mentholated tobacco burning.

1001
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:50,149
We're gonna make more money than
you could get from digging up gold!

1002
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:53,591
-He's right, you know.
-All right, Woody, when?

1003

What's going on here?

This is the DA, Woody.

1141
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:24,318
You better talk respectful.

1142
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:26,112

01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:30,074
-This is my fiance.
-Well, how nice.

1144
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:35,075
l'll ask you. What do you know about
the whereabouts of Senator Rawkins?

1145
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:37,271
Nothing, and neither does she.

1146
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:40,592
There's 50 witnesses
saw her do her mumbo jumbo.

1147
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:44,759
And the split second she did,
Rawkins turned black, disappeared.

1148
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:48,350
-That's crazy talk!
-Folks around here are getting nervous.

1149
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,551
Could be dangerous.

1150
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:56,149
You're supposed to keep law and order
around here, not this white suit.

1151
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:59,432
That's why we're conducting
this preliminary investigation...

1152
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:01,358
...on charge of witchcraft.

1153
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:03,792
Witchcraft?

1154
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,389
-You gotta be kidding.
-Concludes Tuesday.

1155
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:10,912
By which day, Rawkins
had better be produced in the flesh.

1156
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:16,595
l'm sorry, but we're gonna
be busy on Tuesday.

1157
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,519
-We're getting married.
-Don't count on that...

1158
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:23,030
...or anything else if Rawkins isn't back.

1159
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,433
Bye!

1160
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:30,875
Oh, Woody, you're grandish.

1161
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:33,590
You've made me deliriously happy.

1162
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:35,393
Happy?

1163
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:38,115
Trouble makes you happy? Come on.

1164
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:40,470
No, you make me happy.

1165
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:42,511
-You don't know why, do you?
-No, why?

1166
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:45,314
Because you said it.
And you said it all by yourself.

1167
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:48,796
You volunteered it without me,
without magic, without me father...

1168
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,560
-...twisting and tricking you into it.
-What'd l say?

1169
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,910
That l'm your fiance,
which is to say...

1170

And we're gonna get married
on Tuesday. lt's grandish.

1173
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:03,838
Didn't know what l was saying.

1174
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:06,952
Something came over me,
like a spell come over me.

1175
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:08,832
Hey, wait a minute, now.

1176
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:11,396
lt ain't true, is it?

1177
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,558
Ain't what true?

1178
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,515
About you being a witch.

1179
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:18,958
Of course it's true.

1186
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:57,309

You don't have to grab, mister.
There's plenty of apples around.

-Well, l don't see any.
-Because you're mortal!

1202
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,959
You're mortal! Mortals can never see

1203
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:07,230
An apple here. An apple there.

1204
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:11,991
Little red apples everywhere.

1205
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:16,879
You must be very hungry.
Would you like a sandwich?

1206
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:19,714
Yeah.

1207
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:22,395
Nice Virginia ham.

1208
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,235
This is cheese! l ordered ham!

1209
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:33,152
Forced to eat cheese.

1210
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:37,076
-Forced to hide out like a hunted possum.
-Who are you hiding from?

1211
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:41,270
My associates, my people, my dog...

1212
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,718
...my whole way of life.

1213
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:46,878
-l can't show myself like this.
-What's wrong with you?

1214
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:48,877
Are you blind, boy?

1215
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,196
Can't you see l'm black?

1216
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:53,912
l think it's very becoming.

1217
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:55,348
Well, it isn't!

1218
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:58,393
l'm a white man, damn it!
l'm a white man!

1219
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:01,270
At least l was until
a couple of days ago.

1220
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:03,277
Well, that's a coincidence.

1221
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,755
l was green a couple of weeks ago!

1222
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:08,269
Don't you find the change
of color interesting?

1223
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:09,549
No, l don't!

1224
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:12,797
And they won't get away with it.
They won't get away with it!

1225
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,399
Don't have to get so excited.

1226
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:18,718
l think it's just ridiculous making
such a fuss about a person's color.

1227
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:21,798
Well, you don't realize what it's like
being black here.

1228
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,149
But you're human!

1229
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:25,112
<i>A rose is a rose is a rose</i>

1230
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:26,992
<i>Despite the color of your nose</i>

1231
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:29,350
You don't understand, boy.

1232
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:32,637
-You're nothing when you're black!
-Nothing? Who says so?

1233
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:35,559
-The law says.
-Well, it's a silly law.

1234
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:37,113
But is it a legal law?

1235
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:40,153
Of course it's legal. l wrote it myself!

1236
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:53,950
-Change it back.
-How am l gonna do that?

1237
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:57,197
-You said you had it changed days ago.
-l said no such thing.

1238
01:42:57,400 --> 01:43:00,073
-Some witch wished it on me.
-A witch! A witch!

1239
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:04,353
-l can help you. What sort of a witch?
-l didn't look her up in <i>Who's Who</i>!

1240
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:08,075
She's bound to be in <i>Which Is Witch</i>.
lt lists their curses and cures--

1241
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:10,077
Boy, go away, will you!

1242
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,550
l see your trouble now, mister.

1243
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:27,553
You're too unfriendly.

1244
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:30,149
l'm in no condition for friendship!

1245
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:32,476
That witch's fault!

1246
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:34,793
She gave you a new outside...

1247
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,116
...and she should've given you
a new inside.

1248
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:41,108
-That's very incompetent.
-Will you go away!

1249
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:46,115
This will give witchcraft a bad name.

1250
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:49,910
lt'll set the entire profession
back 100 years.

1251
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:53,517
l'll have to do something about it.

1252
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:55,676
Me reputation's at stake.

1253
01:43:57,680 --> 01:44:00,433
l'll have to alter your personality.
Stand up, please.

1254
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:07,398
-Why don't you leave me alone.
-This won't be too hard.

1255
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:11,195
All we have to do is to broaden out
that narrow mind a little...

1256
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:13,118
...reduce some of that bigotry...

1257
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:16,392
...and your pomposity
won't show through at all.

1258
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:19,034
Wait till they see you
in your new spring psyche.

1259
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:22,391
People will say you're in love.

1260
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:24,319
Now....

1261
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:27,311
<i>Fiddle, foddle</i>

1262
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:29,351
<i>Foil and fiddle</i>

1263
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:32,199
<i>Cure this fuddled individual</i>

1264
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:34,436
<i>Whirl, ye waters, and unwind</i>

1265
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:36,870
<i>This tangled, medieval mind</i>

1266
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:39,355
<i>Breath of bee and bluebird's wing</i>

1267
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:42,120
<i>Make this scowling spirit sing</i>

1268
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,993
<i>Balm of briar, sandalwood</i>

1269
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:47,668
<i>Season him with brotherhood</i>

1270
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:50,599
<i>Magic vapors, make this person</i>

1271
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,916
<i>A better person</i>

1272
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:56,831
<i>Not a worse one</i>

1273
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:00,388
He sleeps!

1274
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:03,988
The cure is beginning to work!

1275
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:08,759
<i>How are things in Glocca Morra?</i>

1276
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:51,394
<i>Oh, dem golden slippers!</i>
<i>Oh, dem golden slippers!</i>

1277
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:56,391
<i>Golden slippers I laid away</i>
<i>Can't touch'em till my wedding day</i>

1278
01:45:56,600 --> 01:46:00,673
<i>Oh, dem golden slippers!</i>
<i>Oh, dem golden slippers!</i>

1279
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:05,032
<i>Golden slippers I laid away</i>
<i>Until my wedding day, oh!</i>

1280
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:07,834
<i>Oh, dem golden slippers!</i>
<i>Oh--</i>

1281
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:10,036
Brother!

1282
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:13,437
Brother, you're the voice
in the wilderness.

1283
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:16,359
Allow me the honor
of shaking your hand.

1284
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:20,155
Well, thank you, friend. lt's nice
to be able to talk to somebody again.

1285
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:24,239
Just whom, may l ask, do we have the
unexpected pleasure of meeting up with?

1286
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:27,079
Just call me Bill.
You folks from around here?

1287
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:30,238
-We're from around everywhere.
-Yeah. We travel and we sing.

1288
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:33,671
Haven't you ever heard of
the Passion Pilgrim Gospeleers?

1289
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:36,235
l've been out of touch
with the gospel recently.

1290
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:39,238
We're the prize-winningest,
Gospel-singingest quartet...

1291
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:41,476
...east of the Rockies!

1292
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:45,078
Quartet? Why, there's only three of you.

1293
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:48,875
Well, you see, brother, we suffered
a casualty last night.

1294
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:52,755
Yes, there was our number-four man,
Russ, suddenly taken with temptation.

1295
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:54,791
And in desperation, he cries out:

1296
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,275
-''Get thee behind me, Satan!''
-And Satan got--

1297
01:46:57,480 --> 01:46:59,038
-Satan pushed--
-He pushed him--

1298
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:02,152
Right into the arms of a bouncing
Babylonian Jezebel...

1299
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:05,272
-...from Biloxi, Mississippi.
-Oh, the soul was strong...

1300
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:06,754
...but the flesh was weak.

1301
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:09,758
And that's why divine providence
led us to you.

1302
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:11,279
You may be Bill...

1303
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:14,392
...but that voice inside you is Russ.

1304
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:18,070
l wouldn't be a bit surprised.
l had a lot of shuffling around lately.

1305
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:20,032
Well, your shuffling days are over.

1306
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:23,755
With your voice, we can go right on
being a prize-winning quartet.

1307
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:27,396
-l can make a living singing with you?
-There's a handful of ways.

1308
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,397
Either tote that barge.

1309
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:31,192
-Lift that bale.
-Shine that shoe.

1310
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:32,958
-Or sing.
-We sing.

1311
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:36,709
But before we do, somebody's either
gotta get buried or get married.

1312
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:40,310
Over in Rainbow Valley, there's a couple
just aching to be spliced.

1313
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:43,318
And a $20 bill just aching to be split.

1314
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:44,999
Will you join us?

1315
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:47,760
Brothers, you are now a quartet!

1316
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:49,075
Well, good!

1317
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:51,516
Now, in preparation for this ceremony...

1318
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:54,393
...we take our text from Genesis,
wherein it says:

1319
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:57,068
Adam and Eve begat Cain and Abel.

1320
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:02,229
From thence on, the history of the world
is just the history of who begat who.

1321
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:05,876
-Well, what do l sing in that?
-You carry the big theme of this song.

1322
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:09,629
You stress the word''begat''
and keep stressing it.

1323
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:11,671
Can you remember that?

1324
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:13,439
l got it!

1325
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:16,032
<i>-I got it</i>
<i>-I got it</i>

1326
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:17,434
<i>I got it</i>

1327
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:20,715
<i>We got it</i>

1328
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:23,595
<i>The Lord made Adam</i>
<i>The Lord made Eve</i>

1329
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:26,235
<i>He made them both</i>
<i>A little bit naive</i>

1330
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:34,235
<i>They lived as free as a summer breeze</i>
<i>Without pajamas and without chemise</i>

1331
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:39,678
<i>Until they stumbled on the apple trees</i>

1332
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:42,913
<i>Then she looked at him</i>

1333
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:45,598
<i>And he looked at her</i>

1334
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:51,111
<i>And they knew immediately</i>
<i>What the world was fer</i>

1335
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:53,917
<i>He said,''Give me my cane''</i>

1336
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:56,351
<i>He said,''Give me my hat''</i>

1337
01:48:57,240 --> 01:49:01,199
<i>The time has come</i>
<i>To begin the begat</i>

1338
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:02,549
<i>The begat</i>
<i>The begat</i>

1339
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,669
<i>So they begat Cain</i>
<i>And they begat Abel</i>

1340
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:08,440
<i>Who begat the rabble</i>
<i>At the tower of Babel</i>

1341
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:10,995
<i>-They begat the Cohens</i>
<i>-They begat O'Rourkes</i>

1342
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:13,794
<i>And they begat the people</i>
<i>Who believed in storks</i>

1343
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,355
<i>Lordy, Lordy</i>
<i>How they did begat</i>

1344
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:18,869
<i>-How they be-be-begat</i>
<i>-Even more than that</i>

1345
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:21,514
<i>When the begat</i>
<i>Got to gettin' under par</i>

1346
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:24,229
<i>They begat the daughters</i>
<i>Of the D.A.R</i>

1347
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:26,750
<i>They begat the Babbitts</i>
<i>Of the bourgeoisie</i>

1348
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:29,391
<i>Who begat the misbegotten</i> V<i>IPs</i>

1349
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:31,716
<i>They begat</i>
<i>They begat</i>

1350
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:35,073
<i>It was pleasin' to Jezebel</i>
<i>Pleasin' to Ruth</i>

1351
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:37,669
<i>It pleased</i>
<i>the League of Women Shoppers In Duluth</i>

1352
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:40,235

Dearly beloved,

01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,911
Stand back, everybody!

1393
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:38,914
-Don't want any trouble.
-Just what do you want?

1394
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:40,235
Miss Sharon McLonergan.

1395
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:43,876
Mrs. Sharon Mahoney in a few minutes,
if you don't mind.

1396
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:48,839
Dearly beloved...

1397
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:52,715
...we are gathered here today
to join this man and this woman--

1398
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:55,514
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1399
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:58,553
-l got a warrant for your arrest.
-On what charge?

1400
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:00,955
<i>The People v. Miss Sharon McLonergan.</i>

1401
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:03,913
-The charge is demoting!
-''Demoting''?

1402
01:53:04,120 --> 01:53:06,839
Demoting a member of the white race,
Senator Rawkins...

1403
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:10,749
-...down to a member of the Negro race.
-By means of witchcraft.

1404
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:13,235
There's a law against witchcraft
in this state.

1405
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:16,512
Yes, l know. lt was passed in 1690!

1406
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:19,553
l think it's about time
we repealed that law. Right now!

1407
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:20,749
Yeah!

1408
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:25,397
Hold it! Hold it, l said!

1409
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:27,477
Arrest that witch.

1410
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:31,828
All right, Bill.

1411
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:33,712
-Do your duty.
-Sure thing.

1412
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:36,071
All right, come and get me, then!

1413
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:37,872
Arrest her, Sam! Arrest her!

1414
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:40,878
-Arrest her, Sam.
-Well, l'm only a second deputy.

1415
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:43,992
-You're the first.
-Sheriff, quit stalling. Arrest her!

1416
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:46,031
Turn them into pumpkins, Sharon.

1417
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:47,832
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1418
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:51,312
Don't you try any hocus-pocus.

1419
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:53,476
You can't goofer us now.

1420
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:55,033
That there's lizard dust.

1421
01:53:55,240 --> 01:53:56,559
Lizard dust?

1422
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,433
Witchcraft?

1423
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:01,712
-You don't really believe l'm a witch?
-Arrest her!

1424
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:04,514
Wait a minute, now.

1425
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:07,712
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
don't let her bedevil you.

1426
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:10,718
A witch she is, and a witch
she's always been.

1427
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:12,114
Finian....

1428
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:16,153
-He doesn't know what he's saying.
-Oh, yes, l do.

1429
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:20,148
By the age of 10, she'd already
developed her uncanny powers...

1430
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:22,669
...and was changing me good whiskey
into milk.

1431
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:24,472
lt was a crisis!

1432
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:27,069
From then on,
one change led to another...

1433
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:29,794
...and now you're witnesses
to this unhappy climax.

1434
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,276
-She's changed a white man into a black.
-Let me talk to you.

1435
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:35,630
Leave me alone.
l'm doing the right thing.

1436
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:37,114
All right, let's go.

1437
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:38,799
Wait a minute!

1438
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,675
You know, being a witch, she can also
change a black man into a white.

1439
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:44,791
She can make Rawkins white again?

1440
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,912
-Or any color that Your Honor pleases.
-All right!

1441
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,678
Turn him into a white man now.

1442
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:54,589
-Just a minute! l got something to say.
-By God!

1443
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:56,996
-Senator Rawkins.
-Calm yourself, senator.

1444
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:59,589
You're in no position to have opinions
right now.

1445
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:04,112
Who's in a better position? Boy, can
l see both sides of this question!

1446
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,719
How much time will she need?

1447
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:10,109
Well, for a bit of a thing like that,
l would say until the crack of dawn.

1448
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:12,356
l will not be used as evidence...

1449
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:14,869
-...in any witchcraft trial!
-Yeah!

1450
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:16,957
Take him, boys! He's Exhibit A!

1451
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:18,593
Her too!

1452
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:26,351
Now, now, now...

1453
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:28,152
...for your own safety's sake...

1454
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:31,796
...if l were you, l wouldn't be trying
to move her or him.

1455
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:35,028
All right.

1456
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:37,108
The crack of dawn...

1457
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:39,754
...or it'll be the crack of doom,
you hear?

1458
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:42,315
Sheriff, move them all out
but these two.

1459
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:43,839
Clear everybody out!

1460
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,190
Come on! Move!

1461
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:49,229
Sit down!

1462
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:50,714
Wait a minute!

1463
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:53,388
Wait a minute! Wait a....

1464
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:55,958
-Sit down.
-Get out of here, boy!

1465
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:57,878
Get that boy out of here!

1466
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:04,276
The crock's in the ground,
and all's well with the world.

1467
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:14,638
lt's gone!

1468
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:21,278
lt's gone. lt's not here.

1469
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,434
Leprechaun! Og!

1470
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,560
Nemesis! Og!

1471
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:31,193
Og!

1472
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:33,789
Sharon!

1473
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:37,914
Sharon McLonergan!

1474
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:42,273
Sharon?

1475
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:45,715
Sharon.

1476
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:50,712
Look at me, Sharon.

1477
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:53,958
l'm 90 percent mortal now.

1478
01:56:54,160 --> 01:56:56,515
And 100 percent miserable.

1479
01:56:56,920 --> 01:57:00,196
lt's a frenzy, a frenzy.

1480
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:04,160
And the only cure for it is you.

1481
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:08,393
Sharon?

1482
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:17,070
l feel better already
just being near you.

1483
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:18,838
The scent of your hair...

1484
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:20,837
...the touch of your hand.

1485
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:26,271
Oh, the miracle of it, the miracle of it,
the sweet, sweet miracle of it.

1486
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:31,632
She loves me.

1487
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:33,114
Her hand fits me cheek.

1488
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:37,598
Oh, Sharon, you're the only one,
the only one!

1489
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:41,197
You're not Sharon at all.

1490
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:43,675
You're Susan the Silent.

1491
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:47,190
Yet l still feel the same frenzy for you.

1492
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:51,073
ls this what it's like to be mortal?

1493
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:55,198
ls every girl the only girl?

1494
01:57:57,440 --> 01:57:59,271
l'm beginning to like it.

1495
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:02,916
<i>Oh, my heart is beating wildly</i>

1496
01:58:03,120 --> 01:58:07,113
<i>And it's all because you're here</i>

1497
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:14,517
<i>When I'm not near</i>
<i>The girl I love</i>

1498
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:18,315
<i>I love the girl I'm near</i>

1499
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:22,149
<i>Every femme that flutters by me</i>

1500
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:26,478
<i>Is a flame that must be fanned</i>

1501
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:33,677
<i>When I can't fondle</i>
<i>The hand I'm fond of</i>

1502
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:37,350
<i>I fondle the hand at hand</i>

1503
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:41,957
<i>My heart's in a pickle</i>

1504
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:45,477
<i>It's constantly fickle</i>

1505
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:51,398
<i>And not too''partickle,'' I fear</i>

1506
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:58,910
<i>When I'm not near</i>
<i>The girl I love</i>

1507
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:02,590
<i>I love the girl I'm near</i>

1508
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:04,028
Sharon!

1509
01:59:04,240 --> 01:59:06,037
l mean, Susan.

1510
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:08,390
Susan!

1511
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:12,437
<i>What if they're tall and tender?</i>

1512
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:16,713
<i>What if they're small and slender?</i>

1513
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:20,959
<i>Long as they've got that gender</i>
<i>I surrender</i>

1514
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:27,595
<i>Always I can't refuse'em</i>

1515
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:31,475
<i>Always my feet pursues'em</i>

1516
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:36,196
<i>Long as they got a bosom</i>
<i>I woos'em</i>

1517
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:57,835
<i>I love the girl I'm near</i>

1518
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:09,151
<i>When I'm not near</i>

1519
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:13,314
<i>The girl I love</i>

1520
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:18,751
<i>I love the girl I'm near</i>

1521
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:53,756
<i>I'm confessin' a confession</i>

1522
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:58,039
<i>And I hope I'm not verbose</i>

1523
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:05,158
<i>When I'm not close to</i>
<i>The kiss that I cling to</i>

1524
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:08,750
<i>I cling to the kiss that's close</i>

1525
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:12,829
<i>As I'm more and more a mortal</i>

1526
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:16,669
<i>I am more and more a case</i>

1527
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:23,913
<i>When I'm not facing</i>
<i>The face that I fancy</i>

1528
02:01:24,120 --> 02:01:27,715
<i>I fancy the face I face</i>

1529
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:31,949
<i>For Sharon I'm carin'</i>

1530
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:37,189
<i>But Susan I'm choosin'</i>

1531
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:41,313
<i>I'm faithful to whos'n is here</i>

1532
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:44,876
<i>When I'm not near</i>

1533
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:49,398
<i>The girl I love</i>

1534
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:53,639
<i>I love the girl...</i>

1535
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:58,034
<i>...I'm near</i>

1536
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:00,357
So there you are!

1537
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:03,996
The wrath of Ozymandias on you!

1538
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:09,714
From dusk to sunup,
l've searched forest and hill...

1539
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:12,639
...and l find you philandering
with a woman in your arms.

1540
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:13,795
What's wrong with that?

1541
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:15,952
What's wrong!
At a moment like this?

1542
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:18,674
-Have you forgotten me daughter?
-l have not!

1543
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:20,108
She's the woman l love...

1544
02:02:20,320 --> 02:02:22,231
...present company excepted.

1545
02:02:22,440 --> 02:02:26,194
The shamrock of her eyes, and her voice
like the bells of St. Mary's....

1546
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:28,868
-Has anything happened?
-lndeed, it has.

1547
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:31,357
<i>This is her last sunrise.</i>

1548
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:33,677
<i>Twenty minutes from now, at dawn...</i>

1549
02:02:33,880 --> 02:02:35,393
<i>... the glory that was Sharon...</i>

1550
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:39,513
...and the boy that was her beloved
will perish in smoke and flame.

1551
02:02:39,720 --> 02:02:42,075
l told you the gold brings
doom and gloom.

1552
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:43,395
Gloom and doom!

1553
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:45,750
Don't blame the gold!
You're the culprit!

1554
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:47,996
-l?
-Aye. lf you weren't a leprechaun...

1555
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:49,474
...you'd have had no gold.

1556
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:51,989
lf you had none,
l wouldn't have borrowed it.

1557
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:55,988
l wouldn't have come, and me daughter
wouldn't be burned for witchcraft!

1558
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:57,428
lt's my fault.

1559
02:02:57,640 --> 02:02:59,198
lt's all my fault.

1560
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:01,595
Oh, the merciful saints forgive me.

1561
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:07,237
Her broken father will forgive you too,
if you'd just spare a little magic for her.

1562
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:09,829
<i>Oh, anything, Mr. McLonergan.</i>
<i>I'd do anything!</i>

1563
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:12,634
<i>Turn the senator white again</i>
<i>and save Sharon's life!</i>

1564
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:14,558
<i>Og, we've only 20 minutes!</i>

1565
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:16,671
Well, Sambo.

1566
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:19,668
You don't look like
you lightened up a smidgen.

1567
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:22,030
l could do it in a minute
and have 19 left.

1568
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:24,310
Thank heavens.
l knew you wouldn't fail me.

1569
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:26,636
Why not wait 19 minutes...

1570
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:30,037
...and leave it all to the last minute.
lt's more dramatic.

1571
02:03:30,240 --> 02:03:31,468
Now, Og, now!

1572
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:34,717
-lt's a matter of life and death!
-Very well, Mr. McLonergan.

1573
02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:37,150
-l just need one thing from you.
-What is it?

1574
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:40,158
-Speak up, man. What do you need?
-A crock of gold.

1575
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:44,036
Give me strength to resist me
own strength to keep from choking him!

1576
02:03:44,240 --> 02:03:46,708
You stand there and pretend
you haven't got it?

1577
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:49,559
-But l haven't got it!
-Then why can't l find it?

1578
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:53,753
l dug more holes this weary night
than all the gophers in Christendom!

1579
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:56,599
Think back to when you buried it.
What were you doing?

1580
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:59,030
l don't know! How would l know? l....

1581
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:02,789
l had a jug of whiskey in one hand
and the crock of gold in the other--

1582
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,673
You might've buried the jug
and swallowed the crock.

1583
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:09,555
You Machiavellian, half-pint pirate,
stealing me property! l want it back.

1584
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:12,479
-Please, Mr. McLonergan, l wish l had it.
-Where is it?

1585
02:04:12,680 --> 02:04:16,150
-l haven't got it.
-l'll throttle it out of you! l want it back!

1586
02:04:16,640 --> 02:04:18,756
Where is it? Where is it?

1587
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:22,111
You perfidious little wretch....

1588
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:25,756
-l'll throttle it out of you.
-l don't know where it is!

1589
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:27,515
Where is it?

1590
02:04:27,720 --> 02:04:29,233
l wish l....

1591
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:31,915
-Where is it?
-l wish l....

1592
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:40,271
lt's almost dawn.

1593
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:48,353
<i>They can't do it to her.</i>

1594
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:51,199
It'll be one of me or 100 of them!

1595
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:56,359
Og...

1596
02:04:56,560 --> 02:05:00,838
...if you have a mite of merciful magic
left, help me save me daughter's life.

1597
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:02,234
Will you, now?

1598
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:08,918
Oh, Susan, it's a crisis.

1599
02:05:09,560 --> 02:05:11,232
A crisis.

1600
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:16,113
They're gonna burn Sharon
for a witch.

1601
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:18,437
She's not a witch.

1602
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:23,154
She must've been standing by the crock
when she made the wish.

1603
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:24,793
Susan...

1604
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,274
...you must've been there.

1605
02:05:26,480 --> 02:05:28,710
Where was Sharon standing?

1606
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:31,119
Where was she...?

1607
02:05:31,320 --> 02:05:33,754
Oh, it's no good asking you.
You can't hear me.

1608
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:36,110
l'll have to ask somebody else.

1609
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:38,479
There's no time.

1610
02:05:38,680 --> 02:05:40,079
Susan, come here.

1611
02:05:40,280 --> 02:05:41,759
Sit down. Look...

1612
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:45,589
...l'll dance you the questions,
and you dance me the answers, you see?

1613
02:05:45,800 --> 02:05:47,870
Questions, answers, right?

1614
02:05:57,320 --> 02:05:59,231
l'll put it another way.

1615
02:06:41,320 --> 02:06:43,834
Susan, Susan, Susan....

1616
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:46,393
You're a darling girl...

1617
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:48,795
...and l love you very much...

1618
02:06:49,480 --> 02:06:52,313
...but l just wish to God you could talk.

1619
02:06:53,960 --> 02:06:55,109
l love you.

1620
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:01,190
l love you.

1621
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:05,916
Beautiful new words.

1622
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:08,509
Will you say them again?

1623
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:10,278
l love you.

1624
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:11,833
She loves me.

1625
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:13,838
She loves me!

1626
02:07:14,120 --> 02:07:16,953
You're talking, Susan!
Where was Sharon standing?

1627
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:19,993
-l love you!
-Oh, l know that.

1628
02:07:20,720 --> 02:07:22,631
But you're talking.

1629
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:26,151
That means l must've wished you into it.

1630
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:30,391
Which means l must've been standing
over the crock.

1631
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:33,712
The crock, the crock....

1632
02:07:34,120 --> 02:07:37,669
lt looks like you are
permanently a black man.

1633
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:53,273
Oh, my heavens.

1634
02:07:53,480 --> 02:07:54,754
What have l done?

1635
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:04,632
The crock.

1636
02:08:09,640 --> 02:08:11,631
There's only one wish left.

1637
02:08:12,360 --> 02:08:13,918
The last one.

1638
02:08:16,240 --> 02:08:18,913
lf l use it to wish the senator white...

1639
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:23,032
...l'd never be a leprechaun again.

1640
02:08:26,720 --> 02:08:29,393
-We gotta sound the alarm.
-Yes.

1641
02:08:29,600 --> 02:08:32,194
Mr. Rodgers, sound the alarm.

1642
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:34,674
Fire.

1643
02:08:35,400 --> 02:08:36,958
Fire.

1644
02:08:37,880 --> 02:08:38,835
Fire.

1645
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:41,235
But l don't wanna be mortal.

1646
02:08:42,160 --> 02:08:44,628
l wanna go back to fairyland.

1647
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,877
Fairyland was never like this.

1648
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:06,235
Where is she?

1649
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:11,355
Rawkins, you blackguard,
l wish you white!

1650
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:20,996
-She turned him white.
-He's done it!

1651
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:24,269
Thank you, Og.

1652
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:26,072
Release those prisoners!

1653
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:30,475
Come on! Keep that water
coming in here!

1654
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:32,955
-Keep the water coming!
-Keep the water coming.

1655
02:10:33,160 --> 02:10:35,993
-Keep the water coming!
-Keep the water coming!

1656
02:10:36,200 --> 02:10:38,794
-Keep the water coming!
-Susan is talking!

1657
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,150
-Susan's talking!
-Susan's talking!

1658
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:44,158
-Susan's talking.
-Susan's talking.

1659
02:10:44,360 --> 02:10:46,749
-Susan's talking.
-Susan's talking.

1660
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:48,188
Susan....

1661
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:50,152
Susan's talking?

1662
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:51,839
Woody!

1663
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:54,317
-Susan's talking!
-What?

1664
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:58,069
-Susan's talking!
-ls it true?

1665
02:10:59,240 --> 02:11:02,073
Well, say something, will you?
l've been waiting 20 years!

1666
02:11:02,280 --> 02:11:04,350
lsn't it grandish, Woody?

1667
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:09,789
You used the crock to wish back
Susan's tongue.

1668
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:13,276
-Aye.
-And you used up the last wish.

1669
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:15,914
And now the crock has turned
to worthless dross.

1670
02:11:16,120 --> 02:11:21,513
Aye. Right, Mr. McLonergan.
Dross, worthless dross.

1671
02:11:22,640 --> 02:11:25,200
Hey, Woody! Over here!
The lab's going!

1672
02:11:40,720 --> 02:11:44,793
Four years of sweat and work,
and it's all going up in smoke.

1673
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,036
lt's all right, Howard. We'll put it out.

1674
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:52,710
No! No! lt's smoking!

1675
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:08,352
Homegrown mentholated smoke!

1676
02:12:28,720 --> 02:12:33,271
<i>I searched all the earth</i>
<i>And I scanned all the skies</i>

1677
02:12:33,480 --> 02:12:40,909
<i>And I found it at last</i>
<i>In my own true love's eyes</i>

1678
02:12:41,120 --> 02:12:45,352
<i>Look, look</i>
<i>Look to the rainbow</i>

1679
02:12:45,640 --> 02:12:50,714
<i>Follow it over the hill and stream</i>

1680
02:12:50,920 --> 02:12:55,357
<i>Look, look</i>
<i>Look to the rainbow</i>

1681
02:12:56,160 --> 02:13:01,951
<i>Follow the fellow</i>
<i>Who follows a dream</i>

1682
02:13:02,440 --> 02:13:05,273
<i>Follow the fellow</i>

1683
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:08,472
<i>Follow the fellow</i>

1684
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:15,519
<i>Follow the fellow</i>
<i>Who follows a dream</i>

1685
02:13:21,720 --> 02:13:23,517
l now pronounce you...

1686
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:25,438
...man and wife.

1687
02:13:59,720 --> 02:14:01,119
Father...

1688
02:14:02,440 --> 02:14:03,589
...are you leaving us?

1689
02:14:06,760 --> 02:14:07,875
Aye.

1690
02:14:08,080 --> 02:14:09,991
l've had Fort Knox.

1691
02:14:10,200 --> 02:14:11,519
l see.

1692
02:14:14,200 --> 02:14:16,111
Things are indeed hopeless.

1693
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:17,673
Hopeless...

1694
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:19,632
...but they're not serious.

1695
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:21,876
But where are you going?

1696
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:24,591
To find me a rainbow...

1697
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:26,518
...Finian's Rainbow.

1698
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:29,632
lt never fails to come up
when a McLonergan is down.

1699
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:32,798
Sure, there may not be a pot of gold
at the end of it...

1700
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,992
...but there's a beautiful
new world under it.

1701
02:14:38,600 --> 02:14:41,034
Make it shine on Sharon.

1702
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:46,711
Goodbye, me darling.

1703
02:15:08,160 --> 02:15:11,914
Goodbye, me friends.
l'll see you all in Glocca Morra.

1704
02:15:32,680 --> 02:15:34,830
Sharon, where is Glocca Morra?

1705
02:15:37,680 --> 02:15:39,989
Well, you see,
it's always somewhere...

1706
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:41,792
...over there.

1707
02:15:42,760 --> 02:15:49,393
<i>So to every weepin' willow</i>

1708
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:53,993
<i>To each brook along the way</i>

1709
02:15:54,600 --> 02:16:02,473
<i>To each lad who comes a-whistlin'</i>
<i>''Too-ra-lay''</i>

1710
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:10,436
<i>May we meet in Glocca Morra</i>

1711
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:17,439
<i>Some fine day</i>

1712
02:16:17,960 --> 02:16:22,750
<i>How are things in Glocca Morra?</i>

1713
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:27,115
<i>Is that little brook</i>
<i>Still leaping there?</i>

1714
02:16:28,240 --> 02:16:31,835
<i>Does it still run down to Donny Cove</i>

1715
02:16:32,080 --> 02:16:37,473
<i>Through Killybegs,</i>
<i>Kilkerry and Kildaire?</i>

1716
02:16:38,320 --> 02:16:42,598
<i>How are things in Glocca Morra?</i>

1717
02:16:43,160 --> 02:16:47,392
<i>Is that willow tree</i>
<i>Still weeping there?</i>

1718
02:16:48,360 --> 02:16:52,148
<i>Does that laddie</i>
<i>With the twinkling eye</i>

1719
02:16:52,520 --> 02:16:54,590
<i>Come whistling by</i>

1720
02:16:55,000 --> 02:17:00,279
<i>And does he walk away</i>
<i>Sad and dreamy there</i>

1721
02:17:00,560 --> 02:17:03,711
<i>Not to see me there?</i>

1722
02:17:05,240 --> 02:17:09,677
<i>So I'll ask each weeping willow</i>

1723
02:17:10,080 --> 02:17:14,119
<i>And each brook along the way</i>

1724
02:17:14,520 --> 02:17:18,957
<i>And each lad</i>
<i>That comes a-whistlin'</i>

1725
02:17:19,560 --> 02:17:23,553
<i>''Too-ra-lay''</i>

1726
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:29,790
<i>''How are things in Glocca Morra...</i>

1727
02:17:30,560 --> 02:17:40,117
<i>... this fine day?''</i>
