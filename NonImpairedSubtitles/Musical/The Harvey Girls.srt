1
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,875
"While the Harvey system
neither demands nor expects...

2
00:05:02,952 --> 00:05:06,319
"...the impossible from any employee,
it does insist upon honest...

3
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,723
"...excellent, hygienic, cleanly,
prompt and cheerful service at all times."

4
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:14,125
Yes, siree, Bob.
And he means every word of it.

5
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,225
You've been with him a long time.

6
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:19,166
I've been cooking in Harvey Houses
for the last 14 years.

7
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,135
You must be well-done by now.

8
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,934
Madame! You say your coffee is weak?

9
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:31,379
Give it to me.
I'll put it on the chair and let it rest awhile.

10
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:35,713
Just call me "Conscientious Connie,"
the queen of the waitresses!

11
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:38,247
I'm sorry, Miss Bliss.

12
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,783
That's all right, Ethel.

13
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,724
There's one thing you girls
have yet to learn:

14
00:05:43,793 --> 00:05:46,091
A Harvey girl is more than a waitress.

15
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:50,755
Wherever a Harvey House appears,
civilization is not far behind.

16
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:56,334
You girls are the symbol and the promise
of the order that is to come.

17
00:05:57,507 --> 00:06:01,603
The restaurant we're opening in Sandrock
is the first the town has ever had.

18
00:06:02,078 --> 00:06:05,047
Its success depends upon
how you conduct yourselves.

19
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:09,909
Now, how about some lunch?

20
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:49,148
It's lovely. I'm hungry.

21
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,468
- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.

22
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,165
Have you ever eaten
a Chillicothe sandwich, Deborah?

23
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:44,179
- Chillicothe? What's that?
- It's a secret recipe of my Aunt Melvina's.

24
00:07:44,347 --> 00:07:46,508
Won her two blue ribbons
and three husbands.

25
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:49,073
- Try it to see if you like it.
- No, thanks. I'm full.

26
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:52,849
- Would you like to try it?
- Why, yes. Thank you very much.

27
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:56,253
I always wanted to taste
a Chillicothe sandwich.

28
00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:00,388
Tastes just like chicken.

29
00:08:00,463 --> 00:08:03,296
You have to try another
before you can tell the difference.

30
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:05,664
Thank you. I hope I'm not depriving you.

31
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,102
If General Custer had our provisions,
he'd still be standing.

32
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:14,935
I've wanted to meet you ever since
we got on the train at Kansas City.

33
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:17,309
My name is Susan Bradley. I'm from Ohio.

34
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,905
- We're Harvey girls.
- What's that, a college?

35
00:08:19,982 --> 00:08:21,574
No. We're waitresses.

36
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:23,982
We're going to Sandrock
to open a restaurant.

37
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:26,146
Sandrock! That's where I'm going.

38
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:27,416
- Is that your home?
- No.

39
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,650
- Are you visiting?
- No.

40
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:31,625
- Going to work?
- Then why on earth are you going?

41
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:33,625
To get married.

42
00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:38,058
- Does he live in Sandrock?
- Yes, he owns a big ranch there.

43
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:41,763
- What's his name?
- His name is H.H. Hartsey, Esquire.

44
00:08:41,837 --> 00:08:44,670
Is he tall and handsome,
and does he have raven-black hair?

45
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,367
And flashing blue eyes?

46
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:47,975
I like brown eyes.

47
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,581
- His are brown.
- You said they were blue.

48
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,316
Well, they are. I mean, one of them is.

49
00:08:56,652 --> 00:08:57,744
I mean...

50
00:08:58,588 --> 00:09:01,989
Well, to tell you the truth,
I haven't met him yet.

51
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:06,121
- How did you catch him?
- I answered a matrimonial ad in the paper.

52
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:08,459
Well, really!

53
00:09:08,598 --> 00:09:11,192
I once sent my picture
to a lonely hearts club...

54
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:14,236
...but it came back marked,
"We're not that lonely!"

55
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:16,504
Well, I think it's wonderful.

56
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,106
I think it's wonderful, too.
When I answered the ad, he wrote back.

57
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,967
Thank you very much.

58
00:09:24,847 --> 00:09:28,783
- What wonderful curlicues.
- And commas after everything.

59
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:31,544
This is the first one.

60
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:35,316
- Would you like to hear a little of it?
- Yes, indeed. Please.

61
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:41,554
"There is a dream here, in this great land,
that not everybody sees.

62
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:45,732
"Mountains and sunlight,
and the cleanest wind in the world...

63
00:09:46,035 --> 00:09:49,163
"...waiting for a man and a woman
with a little vision."

64
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:51,136
What was so wrong with Ohio?

65
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:54,743
There was nothing wrong with Ohio.
It was just so old-fashioned.

66
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:58,444
There were several men in that town
I could have married, I suppose.

67
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:02,177
Only, it's so smug and sure of itself
and so settled...

68
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,446
...that I wanted a chance
to do something different...

69
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:09,082
...to see something different,
a whole new world opening up.

70
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:12,988
And, after all, the Constitution guarantees
the pursuit of happiness...

71
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:15,587
...but it's up to me to do the pursuing.

72
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:20,093
So that's why I answered the ad,
and that's why I'm on this train.

73
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:22,261
I think you did the right thing.

74
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:26,268
- Would you like to see my wedding dress?
- Yes.

75
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,071
I must say, I admire your spirit.

76
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:36,342
Most girls would have come out here
and gotten married in a navy blue suit.

77
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,978
That must be Sandrock!

78
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,460
Mrs. H.H. Hartsey, Esquire.

79
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,414
Mighty nice looking sign
you're putting up there, Mr. Adams.

80
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,117
You being the manager of the place...

81
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:19,753
...I suppose you're optimistic enough
to think it's going to stay there.

82
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:22,626
There are a lot of them
around the country, Judge...

83
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:25,565
...and I haven't heard of any of them
failing to stay put.

84
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:29,004
It's a pity you'll be disillusioned so soon.

85
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:36,810
- Hi, Judge.
- Hi, boys.

86
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,847
- How are you, Judge?
- Good day, Judge.

87
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:40,313
Hello, John Henry.

88
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:47,389
Hey, Mike, where's the boss?

89
00:11:48,023 --> 00:11:49,149
Right over there.

90
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:02,169
Trent, I want to talk to you.

91
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:04,038
There's a lady singing.

92
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:42,475
- That's a good number.
- Terry taught it to me.

93
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:44,172
- Good work, Terry.
- Thanks.

94
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:48,114
- It's really Em's voice that puts them over.
- My voice? He's so young.

95
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,209
Trent, I got to talk to you.

96
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:53,983
What is stopping you, Sam?
The lady's finished her song.

97
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:56,081
- Hey, boss.
- Yeah?

98
00:12:56,158 --> 00:12:58,092
- Is he good for a drink?
- Has he had it?

99
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,388
- Yeah.
- He's good.

100
00:12:59,462 --> 00:13:02,795
Now, look here, Trent,
I've wasted all the time I've got to waste.

101
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,025
Got a match?

102
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,330
Mighty nice looking place you got here.

103
00:13:07,403 --> 00:13:09,894
Next year, we plan to put up lace curtains.

104
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:12,639
Not if you have to shut down, you won't.

105
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:15,233
Who's going to shut us down? You?

106
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:18,940
You know what I mean.
You can't laugh off the new Harvey outfit.

107
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:22,711
Have you ever seen a restaurant?
They serve food.

108
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,013
Next, the church will open up again.
Mark my words.

109
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:30,081
Are you boys admiring each other's eyes
or reading each other's epitaphs?

110
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,989
Em, the Judge is losing his grip.

111
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:36,464
He's afraid of a place that sells vittles.
Vittles and a pack of calf-faced girls.

112
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:39,365
Those girls can fill up a town
faster than law officers.

113
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:42,370
- You listen to the Judge, Ned.
- This is my business.

114
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:45,171
Let's get one thing straight:
We're not partners.

115
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,506
You run the town, I'll run the Alhambra.
You'll get your usual cut.

116
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,942
But not just as much.

117
00:13:50,045 --> 00:13:52,275
He's right. Look what happened at Larrup.

118
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:55,613
The men married the waitresses faster
than they could replace them.

119
00:13:55,684 --> 00:13:56,708
They did?

120
00:13:56,785 --> 00:13:59,982
It's so quiet, you'd think it was
New England instead of New Mexico.

121
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:02,922
- Nice women can ruin a town, right?
- And how.

122
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:06,686
- The house will buy you a drink.
- That's a little better.

123
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:09,196
- Where's Trent?
- He's over there, at the bar.

124
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,459
Hey, Ned!

125
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:14,435
It's all due to you.

126
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:16,095
- How can I ever thank you?
- What?

127
00:14:16,171 --> 00:14:19,663
- My bride's coming in on the noon train.
- You're married, Hartsey?

128
00:14:19,742 --> 00:14:21,073
I ain't, but I will be.

129
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:23,873
She's come all the way out here
from Ohio to marry me.

130
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,210
And here's the fellow what's done it.

131
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:30,048
It was him. He writ the letters for me.
He courted her for me on paper.

132
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,644
Hartsey, maybe you'd better hightail it
to the desert.

133
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:36,452
- I'll meet her and send her back to Ohio.
- It's like a blind date for life.

134
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:39,187
You don't know what you're doing.
You can't tell by letters.

135
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:41,092
She probably weighs 200 pounds.

136
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:45,160
That's all right.

137
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:49,666
This calls for a celebration.
Hey, everybody.

138
00:14:49,738 --> 00:14:53,538
Hartsey will be married this afternoon.
I'll treat to champagne.

139
00:14:57,846 --> 00:15:00,280
Here's to H.H. Hartsey
and his rosy happiness...

140
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:03,409
...coming in on the Atchison, Topeka
and the Santa Fe.

141
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,045
Here she comes!

142
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:24,287
All aboard!

143
00:23:26,788 --> 00:23:27,880
- Miss Bliss?
- Yes.

144
00:23:27,956 --> 00:23:29,423
- I'm Jed Adams.
- How do you do?

145
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,356
- Welcome to Sandrock.
- Thank you.

146
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:34,327
I want you to meet Mr. Adams,
the Harvey House manager.

147
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:37,194
Miss Walters, Miss Johnson,
Miss Harper...

148
00:23:53,048 --> 00:23:56,449
Why, you rambunctious coyote!
I'll teach you.

149
00:23:56,518 --> 00:24:00,010
- Wait a minute, ma'am. I'm Mr. Hartsey.
- I don't care who you are.

150
00:24:00,088 --> 00:24:04,525
But, ma'am, ain't you Miss Susan Bradley,
the lady that came out here to marry me?

151
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:07,858
That's Miss Susan Bradley back there.

152
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:16,502
If you ladies will please follow me.
We've been awaiting your arrival.

153
00:24:16,571 --> 00:24:18,505
Really? That's very nice.

154
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,250
Who are they?

155
00:24:36,825 --> 00:24:38,156
Ladies! Ladies!

156
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:49,430
How do, Miss Bradley?

157
00:24:50,605 --> 00:24:52,505
Hello, Mr. Hartsey.

158
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,236
- Can I carry your bag, ma'am?
- My bag? Where?

159
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,676
I thought we was going down here to...

160
00:24:58,613 --> 00:25:02,174
Yes, please, do. Thank you very much.

161
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,251
- Are you disappointed?
- Disappointed?

162
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:10,958
Well, I mean, you didn't expect
a mangy old buzzard like me, or did you?

163
00:25:11,026 --> 00:25:15,554
Yes, I did. I mean,
I don't think you're a mangy old buzzard.

164
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:17,392
I mean, I...

165
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,967
You look like a very kind
and reasonable man.

166
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:26,832
Then you like me?
You mean you really like me?

167
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:31,371
I, of course, don't know you very well,
but you...

168
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,281
...certainly look to me
like a very kind and reasonable man.

169
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:38,079
Thank you, ma'am. I like you, too.

170
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,512
Thank you.
Of course, there's one thing I forgot.

171
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:46,083
I left it out of my letters.
I'm an awful housekeeper.

172
00:25:46,661 --> 00:25:47,855
That's all right.

173
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:51,023
In these parts,
we live outside mostly, anyways.

174
00:25:53,735 --> 00:25:56,795
- I'm a terrible cook.
- Don't let that worry you, ma'am.

175
00:25:56,871 --> 00:26:00,329
Out here, we just put things
over a fire and take what happens.

176
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:05,011
Well, that's just fine, isn't it?

177
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,982
It's great. I can't wait for us
to be hitched up, can you?

178
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,145
Can't wait.

179
00:26:11,686 --> 00:26:15,918
- I'm going to be the happiest man in town.
- I'm going to be the happiest girl.

180
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,387
Well, after all,
that's what I came out here for, isn't it?

181
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,995
Well, yes, ma'am.

182
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:30,796
Miss Bradley, I think you should know
something more about me.

183
00:26:30,872 --> 00:26:34,069
I chew tobacco and I drink.
I'm a terrible drinker.

184
00:26:34,142 --> 00:26:36,872
And I gamble.
Gambling, that's my downfall.

185
00:26:36,945 --> 00:26:39,436
Well, Mr. Hartsey, you sound as if you...

186
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,641
Could it be possible
you don't want to marry me?

187
00:26:41,716 --> 00:26:44,947
Wait, Miss Bradley. I want to marry you.
I want to marry you badly.

188
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,353
I want to marry you something awful,
but please, ma'am...

189
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,023
...please say no.

190
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:55,263
Mr. Hartsey, I think you're wonderful.

191
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,158
Of course, if you insist, I'll say no.

192
00:26:59,267 --> 00:27:01,167
I sure do thank you, ma'am.

193
00:27:01,836 --> 00:27:05,636
Well, anyway,
I thought your letters were beautiful.

194
00:27:06,007 --> 00:27:08,498
Gosh, I didn't even write them letters.

195
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,301
They was written
by a fellow named Ned Trent.

196
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,539
Who's Ned Trent?

197
00:27:12,614 --> 00:27:15,549
That was Ned's idea, all in the first place.

198
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:19,314
You know, I bet he thought
that'd be some kind of a funny joke like.

199
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,818
- A joke?
- Yes, ma'am.

200
00:27:21,923 --> 00:27:24,756
You mean,
I've come 2,000 miles for a joke?

201
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:31,128
- Where will I find this Ned Trent?
- Well, he's right inside there, ma'am.

202
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:33,429
Miss Bradley, you can't go in there.

203
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:40,834
Pardon me, which one is Mr. Trent?

204
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:44,470
- The guy over there without the hat.
- Thank you.

205
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,521
- Mr. Trent. Mr. Trent.
- See me later, I'm busy.

206
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,286
Wait a minute.

207
00:28:02,897 --> 00:28:04,626
- Mr. Trent!
- Go away, will you?

208
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:06,223
Not until I've talked to you.

209
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:08,826
If it's about a job,
grab a drink and I'll see you later.

210
00:28:08,903 --> 00:28:09,961
- A drink?
- Open.

211
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:11,505
Call and raise.

212
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,099
- How many, Trent?
- Two cards.

213
00:28:16,077 --> 00:28:17,101
How many?

214
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:20,103
Holding a kicker?
My grandfather always said that...

215
00:28:20,181 --> 00:28:21,409
Hang your grandfather!

216
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:24,509
If he were alive,
it's more than likely he'd hang you.

217
00:28:29,023 --> 00:28:31,457
Who are you?
What are you doing in this place?

218
00:28:31,526 --> 00:28:34,359
I'm just somebody who doesn't like you,
Mr. Trent.

219
00:28:34,696 --> 00:28:38,860
I don't know if you're a thief or a murderer,
but I know one thing: You're worse.

220
00:28:39,033 --> 00:28:43,163
I never met, or read,
or heard of anyone lower than you are.

221
00:28:44,873 --> 00:28:47,899
You're a yellow-dog, Mr. Trent. Good day.

222
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:50,935
- Who was that?
- I don't know...

223
00:28:51,012 --> 00:28:53,003
...but I'm sure going to find out.

224
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:58,051
Hey, wait a minute!

225
00:28:59,421 --> 00:29:01,048
What was that all about, miss?

226
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:03,613
"When the setting sun lowers
its mantle of gold...

227
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:05,955
"...over the valley that shall be our home..."

228
00:29:06,027 --> 00:29:08,154
The letters! You're Hartsey's...

229
00:29:09,864 --> 00:29:11,923
- But you couldn't be!
- Well, I am.

230
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,467
Susan Bradley.

231
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:21,066
Well, look,
take this and go on back to Ohio.

232
00:29:21,276 --> 00:29:22,538
Nothing's happened...

233
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:25,477
...except that a nice girl
has had an interesting trip.

234
00:29:25,547 --> 00:29:28,243
Oh, wouldn't you love it
if I went back to Ohio?

235
00:29:28,316 --> 00:29:30,944
Me and the other nice girls
who came out here today!

236
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,213
Well, they won't.

237
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:35,017
Whatever you and the other cutthroats do,
we won't.

238
00:29:35,089 --> 00:29:38,252
Listen to me. If anybody leaves here,
it'll be you and your kind.

239
00:29:38,326 --> 00:29:42,422
Men who run gambling palaces
and send lying letters to girls...

240
00:29:42,497 --> 00:29:44,692
...and sell a lot of liquor to drunkards.

241
00:29:44,766 --> 00:29:48,566
Before we're finished with this town,
you'll swallow those letters you wrote...

242
00:29:48,636 --> 00:29:51,070
...and yes, I hope you choke on them, too!

243
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,582
- Miss Bliss.
- Yes, Susan?

244
00:30:07,655 --> 00:30:10,055
You've got yourself another Harvey girl.

245
00:32:14,983 --> 00:32:17,543
Dining room to the left.
Lunch counter to the right.

246
00:32:17,619 --> 00:32:20,986
Ample notice will be given
before the departure of the train.

247
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,593
- Hi, Goldust. When did you blow in?
- Just passing through.

248
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:41,260
You've got too much class
for these prairie dogs.

249
00:33:41,335 --> 00:33:42,859
Come to the coast with me.

250
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:46,270
No dice, Goldust. Keep asking.
It's good for my morale.

251
00:33:51,012 --> 00:33:54,345
- Going to have supper with me?
- As a matter of fact, I'm dining out.

252
00:33:54,415 --> 00:33:57,384
- Harvey House?
- I'll stroll over and size up the competition.

253
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,714
Yours or mine?

254
00:33:59,353 --> 00:34:00,547
What do you mean?

255
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:03,055
I'd still like to know
what was in those letters.

256
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:06,093
If I did, I'd probably know you
as well as you know me.

257
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,650
It's no mystery, Em.

258
00:34:08,563 --> 00:34:11,191
Why do you go out alone
in the desert all the time?

259
00:34:11,265 --> 00:34:13,631
- Who said I do?
- Everybody knows you do.

260
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:16,969
What have you got buried in that valley?

261
00:34:17,605 --> 00:34:21,268
You wouldn't believe this, Em,
but I've got nothing in that valley.

262
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,834
It's nice to look at.

263
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:26,641
See you later.

264
00:34:44,732 --> 00:34:48,168
- Your order, sir?
- I'll have a great big sirloin steak.

265
00:34:48,402 --> 00:34:49,494
One steak.

266
00:34:52,406 --> 00:34:55,432
- Welcome to the Harvey House.
- Thank you, Miss Bradley.

267
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,774
- How would you like your steak?
- Rare.

268
00:34:58,045 --> 00:34:59,774
Rare. Potatoes?

269
00:34:59,881 --> 00:35:02,008
- Just the steak.
- Just the steak.

270
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,549
If you can get it.

271
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:06,117
We're famous for our steaks, Mr. Trent.

272
00:35:13,127 --> 00:35:15,220
We'll have your steak in a minute, sir.

273
00:35:15,296 --> 00:35:18,390
Hey! What did she do that for?
I wasn't finished.

274
00:35:18,466 --> 00:35:20,161
It's because of your manners.

275
00:35:20,234 --> 00:35:22,930
In a place like this,
you don't blow on your soup.

276
00:35:23,004 --> 00:35:25,700
You fan it with your hat.

277
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:30,342
One sirloin steak, rare.

278
00:35:30,578 --> 00:35:32,512
- We ain't got it.
- What?

279
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,708
No roast beef or lamb chops...

280
00:35:34,782 --> 00:35:37,546
...and not a single one
of those famous Harvey steaks.

281
00:35:37,618 --> 00:35:40,018
- The meat's disappeared.
- And so has our manager.

282
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:41,714
I think I know what's happened.

283
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:45,486
- Anything could have happened.
- You think somebody stole all that?

284
00:35:46,194 --> 00:35:48,287
I'm looking forward to the steak.

285
00:35:48,362 --> 00:35:50,262
You shall have it, Mr. Trent.

286
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,166
Get out, you drunk!

287
00:37:26,794 --> 00:37:28,284
Stick 'em up!

288
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:32,733
Come on. Stick 'em up, now!

289
00:37:37,638 --> 00:37:40,198
Anybody that gets in my way...

290
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:43,801
...you're going to have to answer
for the consequences.

291
00:37:43,945 --> 00:37:45,742
So, come on. Stick 'em up!

292
00:37:46,414 --> 00:37:48,109
Watch out, men. Be careful!

293
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:51,777
I'd rather have Deadeye Dick
than a female with a gun in her hand!

294
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,120
Now, I'm from the Harvey House.

295
00:37:54,655 --> 00:37:57,419
We got a lot of hungry people there
waiting to be served.

296
00:37:57,491 --> 00:38:00,221
And I don't want to hurt anybody.
Honestly, I don't!

297
00:38:00,294 --> 00:38:04,788
But we're famous for our steaks,
and I'm not going to let anybody stop me.

298
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:07,129
So, come on, get 'em up. Put 'em up!

299
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,429
That's right.

300
00:38:10,071 --> 00:38:13,199
Now, you,
tell me where that meat is or I'll shoot.

301
00:38:13,274 --> 00:38:14,434
What meat?

302
00:38:26,787 --> 00:38:28,914
Lady, your meat's in there.

303
00:38:38,766 --> 00:38:40,893
Come on, boys. Get your hands up!

304
00:38:49,377 --> 00:38:51,311
Mr. Adams, are you all right?

305
00:38:51,712 --> 00:38:53,873
John Henry, go there and untie Mr. Adams.

306
00:38:53,948 --> 00:38:56,143
I need strong men to carry this meat.

307
00:38:56,217 --> 00:38:58,685
- Right away.
- Pick up the trays. Come on.

308
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,221
Get it back to the Harvey.
You ought to be ashamed.

309
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:03,688
We have people to feed there.
Come on, hurry up.

310
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,750
- Let's get moving!
- Mr. Adams, will you take this?

311
00:39:06,827 --> 00:39:09,523
- John Henry, get these down here.
- Yes, ma'am.

312
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,792
Come on. Hurry up. March.

313
00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:13,630
Come on. Out.

314
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,360
Thank you very much.

315
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,242
I just want to thank you all.

316
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:33,220
My!

317
00:39:34,355 --> 00:39:35,652
Did I do that?

318
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:40,617
I am sorry,
I didn't mean to let it go off again.

319
00:39:41,896 --> 00:39:45,093
You've been very kind
and thank you all very much.

320
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:47,364
- Good night.
- Good night.

321
00:39:59,613 --> 00:40:01,205
One steak, very rare.

322
00:40:58,506 --> 00:41:00,303
Good night, Arabella.

323
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:05,110
Look at that little goose pimple,
all moon-eyed over a song.

324
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:07,374
I just came out for a breath of air.

325
00:41:07,748 --> 00:41:11,809
- Deborah's romantic.
- It isn't that. It's just that I like music.

326
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:18,252
Imagine coming 2,000 miles
from everywhere to hear a song like that.

327
00:41:18,492 --> 00:41:20,016
And from a saloon.

328
00:41:20,127 --> 00:41:22,288
Why did you become a Harvey girl,
Deborah?

329
00:41:22,363 --> 00:41:25,924
I thought it would be exciting.
What I really wanted to be...

330
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:28,599
...was a dancer.

331
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:31,498
But my family thought
it wasn't respectable.

332
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,596
A dancer?

333
00:41:34,775 --> 00:41:37,209
- And you, Alma?
- I lived on a farm.

334
00:41:37,444 --> 00:41:39,639
- Why did you leave it?
- I was hungry.

335
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:45,080
Well, here we are.

336
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,211
Yes, the three of us.

337
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:53,016
I don't know if we're the three musketeers
or the three blind mice.

338
00:47:44,912 --> 00:47:47,608
The low-down, crawling worm.
Shooting at women!

339
00:47:47,714 --> 00:47:52,083
Ladies, I'm afraid we can call that
the opening gun in the battle for Sandrock.

340
00:47:52,152 --> 00:47:55,849
You can fight it without me.
I'm taking the first train out of here.

341
00:47:56,089 --> 00:47:57,681
Girls! Please!

342
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:01,189
You'll not let this crude
theatrical demonstration frighten you.

343
00:48:01,261 --> 00:48:03,388
We won't stay here
to get murdered in our beds.

344
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:06,489
I'm sure, when you calm down,
you'll change your mind and stay.

345
00:48:06,567 --> 00:48:10,503
If I stayed, it wouldn't be because
I changed my mind, but because I lost it.

346
00:48:10,571 --> 00:48:11,538
I'm leaving.

347
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,433
Girls...

348
00:48:14,541 --> 00:48:17,271
...l'd hoped you'd have the courage
to see this through.

349
00:48:17,344 --> 00:48:19,141
But if you insist upon leaving...

350
00:48:19,212 --> 00:48:22,648
...that's a decision
which you'll have to make for yourselves.

351
00:48:50,377 --> 00:48:52,072
Good afternoon, Judge.

352
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,974
So you're back? Still peddling religion?

353
00:48:55,616 --> 00:48:58,608
Sandrock needs it a heap-sight more
than folks on the circuit.

354
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,915
We don't aim to have a church in Sandrock.

355
00:49:00,988 --> 00:49:03,388
You've already got a church in Sandrock,
Judge.

356
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:05,220
All I aim to do is reopen it.

357
00:49:05,292 --> 00:49:08,125
Listen, we agreed
you were going to stay out of this town.

358
00:49:08,495 --> 00:49:09,928
You agreed. I didn't.

359
00:49:09,997 --> 00:49:13,057
You can't scare me
the way you did those girls last night.

360
00:49:13,133 --> 00:49:16,261
- Bullets are an old story to me.
- What's this about bullets, Sam?

361
00:49:16,336 --> 00:49:18,702
- Mind your own business, Ned.
- I'll see you later.

362
00:49:18,772 --> 00:49:22,333
There's always a gun popping off.
That's how it is. Boys will be boys.

363
00:49:22,409 --> 00:49:25,503
They fired a bullet into the lamp
where the girls were sleeping.

364
00:49:25,579 --> 00:49:26,511
That's what I mean.

365
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:29,515
No harm done,
and we got rid of four of them already.

366
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:30,743
Pretty good?

367
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:33,114
Reverend Claggett,
go ahead with the church.

368
00:49:33,186 --> 00:49:34,619
Why, thanks, Mr. Trent.

369
00:49:34,688 --> 00:49:37,054
Ned, the Reverend
doesn't have a sense of humor.

370
00:49:37,124 --> 00:49:40,150
- I'm not joking. Go right ahead, Reverend.
- I will.

371
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:44,091
You go over to those girls right away
and tell them not to worry.

372
00:49:44,164 --> 00:49:46,724
There'll be no more accidental bullets
in their lives.

373
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,598
Wait a minute, Ned.
We're in this together, aren't we?

374
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:52,230
But let's stick
to the Marquis of Queensberry rules.

375
00:49:52,305 --> 00:49:55,763
We should lick a bunch of women
with our hands tied behind our backs.

376
00:49:55,842 --> 00:49:58,208
That's the biggest mistake you ever made.

377
00:49:58,278 --> 00:50:01,736
If they want a church to let off steam in
instead of the Alhambra...

378
00:50:01,815 --> 00:50:04,181
...I guess the Alhambra can hold its own.

379
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,412
Now, go on over there and tell them.

380
00:50:28,742 --> 00:50:33,008
Well, now, that's a promising idea.
I'm quite sentimental about flowers.

381
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,241
I was discussing it with Reverend Claggett.

382
00:50:35,315 --> 00:50:37,715
Reverend?
I thought they'd closed the church.

383
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:40,309
Yes, but we aim to open it again real soon.

384
00:50:40,387 --> 00:50:43,686
There are some people
who don't like the idea of a church here.

385
00:50:43,757 --> 00:50:45,452
Mr. Trent, for instance.

386
00:50:46,026 --> 00:50:48,426
They don't like having
you ladies here either...

387
00:50:48,495 --> 00:50:51,020
...but we figure
to overcome their objections.

388
00:50:51,498 --> 00:50:54,058
Yes, indeed, beautiful flowers.

389
00:50:54,601 --> 00:50:57,126
A church, lovely young ladies like you.

390
00:50:57,404 --> 00:51:00,237
This town is going to be
something to be proud of.

391
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,773
- May I?
- Surely.

392
00:51:01,842 --> 00:51:02,934
Thank you.

393
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:06,577
I'm sorry.

394
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:09,581
A man's apt to forget his manners
in a rough country like this.

395
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,844
- I'm Judge Purvis.
- How do you do?

396
00:51:12,219 --> 00:51:14,983
I'm Miss Susan Bradley
and this is Miss Deborah Andrews.

397
00:51:15,055 --> 00:51:17,717
- How do you do?
- It's nice to meet a man like you here.

398
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:20,783
The pleasure is mine.
I hope we'll see a lot of each other.

399
00:51:20,861 --> 00:51:23,557
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Good day, Miss Andrews.

400
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:25,322
- Miss Bradley.
- Good day.

401
00:51:25,398 --> 00:51:26,888
He's nice, isn't he?

402
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,998
Well, at least there's
one gentleman in Sandrock.

403
00:51:30,437 --> 00:51:32,132
Now I know who fired that shot...

404
00:51:32,205 --> 00:51:34,799
...l'm going to do something
about it right now.

405
00:51:42,249 --> 00:51:43,876
Slumming, Miss Bradley?

406
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:49,588
- I was just looking for your employer.
- You've got your own backyard. Stay in it.

407
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:54,085
You certainly don't mind my coming over
to pay you a little call, do you?

408
00:51:54,161 --> 00:51:56,891
In return for the call
you folks paid us last night?

409
00:51:56,963 --> 00:51:59,124
What do you want out of Ned Trent?

410
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,131
Nothing.

411
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,692
I want to thank him for
all the hospitable things he's done for us.

412
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:07,069
- You're letting it go to your head.
- Letting what go to my head?

413
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:11,167
Listen, don't fool yourself.
Ned ain't doing this for you personally.

414
00:52:11,244 --> 00:52:15,374
When he told Purvis to cut out the rough
stuff, it was no love message to you.

415
00:52:15,448 --> 00:52:18,144
When he told Claggett
to open up the church...

416
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,982
...it doesn't mean
he'll put on a pair of white gloves...

417
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,022
...and cuddle up to you in the front pew.

418
00:52:23,089 --> 00:52:26,490
If you meant anything,
he wouldn't have sent Judge to tell you.

419
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,462
Ned Trent can talk for himself.
But you don't mean anything to him, see?

420
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:34,762
He don't consider you worth fighting.
He'll give you your flowers and church.

421
00:52:34,835 --> 00:52:36,564
You can sleep all you want at night.

422
00:52:36,636 --> 00:52:40,094
But still he won't recognize you
the next time he looks at you.

423
00:52:41,141 --> 00:52:42,836
You're in love with him.

424
00:52:43,043 --> 00:52:46,740
Me in love with him?
Why, he don't even know I'm alive.

425
00:52:47,514 --> 00:52:48,981
Him and his valley.

426
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:52,216
Valley? What valley?

427
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:55,077
He doesn't even know you're alive either.

428
00:52:56,656 --> 00:53:01,059
- You're not very sure of yourself, are you?
- Listen, you little insignificant...

429
00:53:01,127 --> 00:53:04,790
I may be little,
and I suppose I am insignificant...

430
00:53:04,998 --> 00:53:07,933
...but I must be getting somewhere,
my friends and I...

431
00:53:08,001 --> 00:53:11,994
...or a significant citizen like you
could never be so very, very worried.

432
00:53:29,389 --> 00:53:30,617
'Morning.

433
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,267
You the new blacksmith?

434
00:53:42,335 --> 00:53:44,530
We just opened up and I...

435
00:53:45,238 --> 00:53:47,934
My name is Peters.
Most people call me Marty.

436
00:53:48,675 --> 00:53:52,941
Well, my name's Maule,
but where I come from people call me Tex.

437
00:53:53,013 --> 00:53:55,345
- Where do you come from, Tex?
- Massachusetts.

438
00:53:55,415 --> 00:53:57,474
Take good care how you shoe this horse.

439
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:00,644
Last time, they done it all wrong,
and I didn't like it, see.

440
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,416
- Horse is like my own brother.
- There is a resemblance.

441
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,186
That is, I mean to say,
you can trust me, sir.

442
00:54:06,293 --> 00:54:08,761
I'll shoe him like he was my own brother.

443
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:24,443
His shoes are about six and seven-eighths.
There's one up there.

444
00:54:30,317 --> 00:54:31,545
I'll be back.

445
00:54:41,561 --> 00:54:43,825
Chris! What's the matter?

446
00:54:43,897 --> 00:54:46,058
Marty Peters was here. He left his horse...

447
00:54:46,132 --> 00:54:48,726
Marty Peters!
The one that shot the last blacksmith?

448
00:54:48,802 --> 00:54:52,670
Yeah. He seems to think a lot
of this horse and... He did what?

449
00:54:52,739 --> 00:54:55,640
It's really only a rumor
based on circumstantial evidence.

450
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,199
- No eyewitnesses?
- A few...

451
00:54:57,277 --> 00:55:00,075
...but nobody actually saw
the bullet leave the gun.

452
00:55:00,814 --> 00:55:04,181
If you're going to shoe that horse,
you'd better get started.

453
00:55:06,419 --> 00:55:08,819
Alma, I've a confession.

454
00:55:11,992 --> 00:55:14,961
- I'm afraid of horses.
- That's all in your mind.

455
00:55:15,795 --> 00:55:18,161
- Say to yourself, "I'm brave."
- I'm brave.

456
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,062
- "I'm determined."
- I'm determined.

457
00:55:20,133 --> 00:55:23,227
- "I'm fearless."
- I'm fearless. I'm a liar.

458
00:55:23,303 --> 00:55:26,602
Come ahead, Chris.
Show the horse you're not afraid of him.

459
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:35,546
Would you please sit down
and give me your foot?

460
00:55:36,716 --> 00:55:38,445
That's not the way, silly.

461
00:55:43,223 --> 00:55:44,087
See?

462
00:55:44,624 --> 00:55:45,648
It's very simple.

463
00:55:45,725 --> 00:55:49,718
All you have to do is take the pincers
and pry all the nails from the foot.

464
00:55:49,796 --> 00:55:52,321
Then you take a rasp
and file the foot down.

465
00:55:53,299 --> 00:55:57,292
Then you take a hot shoe, red-hot,
and burn his foot to a level.

466
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,568
Then he's ready for shoeing.

467
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:03,473
Place it on his foot
and drive six long nails into it.

468
00:56:16,556 --> 00:56:18,524
I suppose I'll have to do it.

469
00:56:30,437 --> 00:56:31,335
No.

470
01:00:02,815 --> 01:00:04,715
Lose something, Miss Bradley?

471
01:00:08,087 --> 01:00:10,920
Mr. Trent. Do you mind if I come down?

472
01:00:22,435 --> 01:00:23,527
Thank you.

473
01:00:24,804 --> 01:00:27,466
This country's not healthy for a woman,
Miss Bradley.

474
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:31,306
Why? Do you mean because I tripped?
That could happen back in Ohio.

475
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:33,470
But back in Ohio they'd find you.

476
01:00:34,447 --> 01:00:36,506
It's certainly a nice view from out here.

477
01:00:36,582 --> 01:00:40,609
- Is this where you usually come?
- Yes. Whenever I want to be alone.

478
01:00:43,256 --> 01:00:45,121
I think that's a very good idea.

479
01:00:45,191 --> 01:00:49,651
Getting off by yourself every so often.
It gives you a chance to think things out.

480
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,220
- What are you thinking out?
- Me?

481
01:00:52,832 --> 01:00:54,800
I wanted to get a good look at a fellow...

482
01:00:54,867 --> 01:00:57,961
...who'd run a saloon on one side
and help a church on the other.

483
01:00:58,037 --> 01:01:01,063
You're a little bit mixed up.
I'm not helping any church.

484
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:06,306
My, your valley is beautiful, Mr. Trent.

485
01:01:07,547 --> 01:01:09,481
Almost as beautiful as your letters.

486
01:01:09,549 --> 01:01:11,779
I said I was sorry about the letters.

487
01:01:11,851 --> 01:01:14,547
I'm not angry about that.
I've forgotten about it.

488
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:17,589
I know you had a reason.
You did it for a friend.

489
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:19,983
It was kind of like John Alden.

490
01:01:20,727 --> 01:01:21,659
Alden?

491
01:01:22,462 --> 01:01:24,657
Yes. Don't you know the story?

492
01:01:25,865 --> 01:01:29,562
Well, it seems there was a man
in love with a girl.

493
01:01:29,902 --> 01:01:31,597
Priscilla, her name was.

494
01:01:31,704 --> 01:01:34,935
And he sent John Alden
to propose for him.

495
01:01:36,843 --> 01:01:39,937
John Alden said he would.
It's a wonderful story.

496
01:01:40,012 --> 01:01:43,106
Anyway, right after John Alden
finished proposing...

497
01:01:43,182 --> 01:01:47,084
...Priscilla looked at him and said,
"Why don't you speak for yourself, John?"

498
01:01:47,153 --> 01:01:48,814
Go on. How does it end?

499
01:01:50,757 --> 01:01:54,056
I don't know. It's pretty silly.
I don't think you'd like it.

500
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,925
Why not?
I like all the things Longfellow wrote.

501
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:00,322
Miss Bradley,
do you mind if I ask you something?

502
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:05,034
Do you suppose if I wrote a letter,
a serious letter, that...

503
01:02:05,271 --> 01:02:07,762
...some girl might be willing to marry me?

504
01:02:10,743 --> 01:02:14,804
I suppose judging by me, Mr. Trent,
that she'd take you like that.

505
01:02:17,216 --> 01:02:19,980
I don't know.
Sometimes you don't even have to write.

506
01:02:20,052 --> 01:02:24,455
That's a lot of trouble.
Sometimes all you have to do is that.

507
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:30,224
Some girls are just a little harder to get
than others.

508
01:02:30,296 --> 01:02:33,231
- Like girls from Ohio?
- Yes, Ohio will do. Yes.

509
01:02:33,633 --> 01:02:35,794
Thanks for the story, Miss Bradley.

510
01:02:36,135 --> 01:02:39,229
- You'd better get back to town.
- No, I think I'll stay here.

511
01:02:39,305 --> 01:02:42,172
- It's not safe for a woman alone.
- Really, what could happen?

512
01:02:42,241 --> 01:02:44,232
You could pitch off that cliff.

513
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:46,744
- We've got cliffs in Ohio.
- There are coyotes.

514
01:02:46,813 --> 01:02:50,249
- What else?
- Not to mention a few million snakes.

515
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:54,017
We've got snakes in Ohio, too. What else?

516
01:03:08,568 --> 01:03:10,593
You got that in Ohio, too?

517
01:03:11,771 --> 01:03:14,171
Yes, we've got plenty of that in Ohio...

518
01:03:16,909 --> 01:03:19,503
Here, here, what's the matter?
You all right?

519
01:03:20,847 --> 01:03:23,315
Of course, I'm all right.

520
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:34,048
I bet you think
that's the first time I've ever been kissed.

521
01:03:34,427 --> 01:03:35,451
Isn't it?

522
01:03:37,763 --> 01:03:39,196
Big, strong man.

523
01:03:39,765 --> 01:03:42,495
I bet you carry smelling salts
when you go out with a girl.

524
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:44,433
- Did you want some?
- No!

525
01:04:03,789 --> 01:04:07,748
- It's been a lovely afternoon, Mr. Trent.
- I enjoyed it, too, Miss Bradley.

526
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:14,763
- And now we part.
- Right.

527
01:04:15,301 --> 01:04:16,962
And you disappear back...

528
01:04:17,036 --> 01:04:20,802
...into the gilt and glitter
of your charming establishment.

529
01:04:21,407 --> 01:04:24,433
How many men do you think
would stay here without the Alhambra?

530
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:27,001
Sure the men drink and dance
in my place...

531
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:29,343
...and some of them lose their money...

532
01:04:29,415 --> 01:04:33,112
...but at least they get something in return.
Fun, excitement...

533
01:04:33,853 --> 01:04:36,151
...and a couple of hours of diversion.

534
01:04:36,522 --> 01:04:39,719
And a headache and an empty pocketbook
the next morning.

535
01:04:56,943 --> 01:05:00,276
I was just going to pick up my slippers,
and there it was.

536
01:05:00,346 --> 01:05:02,541
- She might have been bitten.
- Or any of us.

537
01:05:02,615 --> 01:05:05,880
I don't know why I ever came
to this horrible place, I'm leaving.

538
01:05:05,952 --> 01:05:07,146
Me, too.

539
01:05:09,422 --> 01:05:12,823
Strange. How could a snake
have gotten into that closet?

540
01:05:17,396 --> 01:05:21,264
Is this your idea of fun, excitement,
and a little diversion, Mr. Trent?

541
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,393
I told you we're fighting fair, didn't I?

542
01:05:23,469 --> 01:05:26,404
- You can't fight fair and take their side.
- I killed the snake.

543
01:05:26,472 --> 01:05:28,565
It doesn't matter, anyone could've done it.

544
01:05:28,641 --> 01:05:31,405
The men who put the snake in there
are still alive.

545
01:05:31,477 --> 01:05:34,446
And you won't shoot them
because they're your customers.

546
01:05:47,126 --> 01:05:49,287
I just killed one of your pets, Sam.

547
01:05:49,629 --> 01:05:51,187
- I don't get it.
- Get this.

548
01:05:51,263 --> 01:05:54,630
If anything else happens
to the Harvey girls, you'll answer to me.

549
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,828
- You joined up with the petticoats?
- I haven't joined anything.

550
01:05:57,903 --> 01:06:00,030
All I'm saying to you is, lay off.

551
01:06:14,885 --> 01:06:17,285
It's my turn. I'll get the next basket.

552
01:07:04,735 --> 01:07:05,565
Hello.

553
01:07:05,636 --> 01:07:08,605
Hello. I was just passing by
and heard your song.

554
01:07:08,672 --> 01:07:09,764
Do you like it?

555
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:12,570
It's beautiful.
I heard you singing it the other night.

556
01:07:12,643 --> 01:07:14,577
I hoped you were listening.

557
01:11:22,692 --> 01:11:23,852
Deborah.

558
01:11:26,329 --> 01:11:29,628
- I wondered what happened to you.
- I heard the music and...

559
01:11:30,734 --> 01:11:32,827
Susan, this is Mr...

560
01:11:33,003 --> 01:11:35,096
O'Halloran, miss. Terry O'Halloran.

561
01:11:35,172 --> 01:11:37,163
I hope you don't think
there's anything wrong.

562
01:11:38,308 --> 01:11:41,141
No. Of course,
I don't think there's anything wrong.

563
01:11:41,211 --> 01:11:42,542
Let's get out of here.

564
01:11:42,612 --> 01:11:45,479
Listen. Wait a minute.
My intentions are honorable.

565
01:11:45,549 --> 01:11:49,144
Honestly, I mean, no fooling!

566
01:11:50,353 --> 01:11:51,820
Miss Bradley.

567
01:11:53,723 --> 01:11:55,714
I'll be along in just a moment.

568
01:11:57,727 --> 01:12:00,389
Quite a run on Harvey girls
we're having this morning.

569
01:12:00,463 --> 01:12:03,261
Was there another matrimonial ad
in some paper?

570
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:07,295
Look, miss, we hardly know each other,
so suppose we keep it that way.

571
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:08,632
Just a minute.

572
01:12:09,039 --> 01:12:12,202
I hear you and the Harvey girls
are having a little party tonight.

573
01:12:12,275 --> 01:12:13,469
It's a big party.

574
01:12:13,543 --> 01:12:16,273
Don't you think
you should stick to dishwashing?

575
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:20,411
We're minding our own business.
Suppose you stick to your own profession.

576
01:12:20,483 --> 01:12:22,678
Our profession is entertainment, see.

577
01:12:22,752 --> 01:12:24,652
And we don't like competition.

578
01:12:24,988 --> 01:12:28,116
Well, we're amateurs.
Don't tell me you're afraid of us?

579
01:12:28,325 --> 01:12:29,451
Afraid of you?

580
01:12:29,526 --> 01:12:31,756
- Who are you kidding?
- Come on.

581
01:12:31,828 --> 01:12:34,729
- Let me at her.
- Come on.

582
01:12:59,489 --> 01:13:00,956
My arm!

583
01:13:03,493 --> 01:13:05,358
You're tearing my dress.

584
01:15:01,378 --> 01:15:03,005
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

585
01:15:03,079 --> 01:15:04,307
Good evening.

586
01:15:04,914 --> 01:15:06,848
- Won't you go in?
- Thank you.

587
01:18:52,342 --> 01:18:54,970
Now, for the pièce de résistance!

588
01:18:57,046 --> 01:18:59,139
Folks, we'll teach you a brand-new dance.

589
01:18:59,215 --> 01:19:03,208
It's the first dance where a fellow
puts his arm around the lady's waist.

590
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:08,281
It's a brand-new dance
that's all the rage way back East...

591
01:19:08,358 --> 01:19:09,950
...in Kansas City.

592
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:15,263
All right, girls,
line up and demonstrate the waltz.

593
01:20:33,943 --> 01:20:36,571
That's very good, girls.
Now, get yourselves partners.

594
01:20:36,646 --> 01:20:39,376
Come on, boys. Join in.
Let's all have a good time.

595
01:20:39,449 --> 01:20:44,250
- Come on. Let's have a good time.
- I tell you, I can't do it, so help me, ma'am.

596
01:25:31,007 --> 01:25:32,998
Anybody want our tickets?

597
01:25:37,246 --> 01:25:38,736
I'll go, Miss Bliss.

598
01:25:42,251 --> 01:25:45,948
- I'll take your tickets.
- It's our turn to go slumming.

599
01:25:48,090 --> 01:25:49,421
Thank you.

600
01:26:01,971 --> 01:26:03,233
All right, folks.

601
01:26:03,305 --> 01:26:06,866
Step lively now, and everybody choose
your partners for the waltz.

602
01:26:07,777 --> 01:26:10,712
Well, go ahead, ladies,
choose your partners.

603
01:26:22,391 --> 01:26:25,189
I'll bet you're glad to see me, Bucky-boy.

604
01:26:30,766 --> 01:26:33,166
See you later. I'm already took.

605
01:26:34,937 --> 01:26:37,906
- Hello, mister. Dancing?
- Yes, ma'am. I'd be right...

606
01:26:37,973 --> 01:26:42,376
I'm sure he'd like to,
but you see, he has a very bad leg.

607
01:26:43,479 --> 01:26:45,606
Well, maybe some other time.

608
01:26:46,615 --> 01:26:49,516
Well, Miss Cassidy, I ain't got no bad leg.

609
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,187
You have now.

610
01:27:16,946 --> 01:27:20,404
- Now you're acting more like a man, Ned.
- I feel better myself.

611
01:27:24,787 --> 01:27:27,017
Quite a little contest we're having.

612
01:27:27,089 --> 01:27:31,321
Last year, if you didn't like somebody,
you settled it with your fists or a gun.

613
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:35,726
- Now we dance it out, don't we?
- We're doing all right, I'm proud of us.

614
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:45,631
- All right, girls, we don't belong here.
- Let's go where we do belong.

615
01:27:45,741 --> 01:27:48,676
Any of you gentlemen like to join us?

616
01:27:50,146 --> 01:27:53,138
- How about you, Sam?
- It would be a pleasure, Ned.

617
01:27:53,215 --> 01:27:56,412
Any of you gentlemen
care for a little recreation?

618
01:28:03,292 --> 01:28:05,658
Miss Bradley,
something wonderful has happened.

619
01:28:05,728 --> 01:28:08,856
Look at that.
Do you realize what's going on?

620
01:28:08,998 --> 01:28:10,966
That's mighty fine, Reverend Claggett.

621
01:28:11,033 --> 01:28:13,126
- It's wonderful.
- Yes.

622
01:28:13,202 --> 01:28:14,726
It's more than that.

623
01:28:14,804 --> 01:28:18,570
On this night, the male population
of Sandrock, for the first time...

624
01:28:19,008 --> 01:28:22,273
...turned down a wild time
in favor of a good time.

625
01:28:49,805 --> 01:28:51,932
Did you lose something, Mr. Trent?

626
01:28:54,443 --> 01:28:56,604
Yes. I lost a fight, Miss Bradley.

627
01:28:56,745 --> 01:28:59,976
The gingham curtains
and the flower pots get the decision.

628
01:29:00,216 --> 01:29:01,945
You mean you're giving up?

629
01:29:02,585 --> 01:29:03,779
Not exactly.

630
01:29:04,386 --> 01:29:07,378
There's a mining town, Flagstaff,
about 100 miles from here.

631
01:29:07,456 --> 01:29:10,118
That's where Alhambra's planning to move.

632
01:29:13,295 --> 01:29:14,387
When?

633
01:29:15,164 --> 01:29:17,462
Tomorrow morning, the breakfast train.

634
01:29:20,369 --> 01:29:22,837
Is that what you came up here to tell me?

635
01:29:24,006 --> 01:29:25,064
Yes.

636
01:29:27,042 --> 01:29:28,873
What do you expect me to say?

637
01:29:31,247 --> 01:29:32,612
I don't know.

638
01:29:36,852 --> 01:29:40,948
I guess I hoped you'd be glad.
It might make it easier for me to leave.

639
01:29:41,757 --> 01:29:45,750
All right then, I'm glad.
I only wish you'd left a long time ago.

640
01:29:46,228 --> 01:29:49,254
So do I.
Maybe it wouldn't have happened then.

641
01:29:50,833 --> 01:29:53,063
- What?
- Meeting you.

642
01:29:53,602 --> 01:29:57,663
Yes, that was bad, wasn't it?
Two people as far apart as we are.

643
01:29:58,440 --> 01:29:59,304
Yes.

644
01:30:01,443 --> 01:30:04,901
Now, for the first time in my life,
I've got things to remember.

645
01:30:07,549 --> 01:30:10,416
I take it that you don't like memories,
Mr. Trent.

646
01:30:10,886 --> 01:30:12,376
They don't pay off.

647
01:30:13,155 --> 01:30:14,952
They keep you awake nights.

648
01:30:19,628 --> 01:30:21,789
Will you be awake many nights, Ned?

649
01:30:23,899 --> 01:30:28,393
Every night.
I'll be wondering if I should've stayed.

650
01:30:31,941 --> 01:30:33,408
Well, you couldn't.

651
01:30:33,809 --> 01:30:37,870
If you did, it wouldn't make any difference,
you'd be giving in to me.

652
01:30:38,514 --> 01:30:40,573
A thing like this can't be one-sided.

653
01:30:40,649 --> 01:30:43,846
We'd both have to give in.
Both of us together.

654
01:30:44,053 --> 01:30:45,748
Where would that put us?

655
01:30:48,724 --> 01:30:50,453
No place in this world...

656
01:30:52,561 --> 01:30:54,654
...because it just can't be done.

657
01:31:11,547 --> 01:31:12,844
Goodbye, Susan.

658
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:13,831
Can't leave you alone for a minute, can I?

659
01:32:16,345 --> 01:32:17,937
Now, put out that fire.

660
01:32:21,784 --> 01:32:25,447
- Sam, I won't let you do this.
- You're not? We'll see.

661
01:32:26,789 --> 01:32:29,280
We're going to the Alhambra
to have a little talk.

662
01:32:29,358 --> 01:32:30,382
Go ahead.

663
01:34:58,407 --> 01:35:02,366
This way, ladies and gentlemen.
Temporary quarters across the street.

664
01:35:02,444 --> 01:35:05,345
Ample notice will be given
before the departure of the train.

665
01:35:05,414 --> 01:35:08,850
Right across the street.
Temporary quarters across the street.

666
01:35:27,169 --> 01:35:30,502
Trust me, after this town,
Flagstaff will be a pleasure.

667
01:35:49,191 --> 01:35:50,818
Do you want some sugar?

668
01:36:01,703 --> 01:36:03,637
Em, I'll see you on the train.

669
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:12,344
All aboard!

670
01:36:27,896 --> 01:36:31,024
- Where are you going, Ned?
- I don't know myself.

671
01:36:31,099 --> 01:36:33,932
- Well, come on inside.
- Leave me alone. I've got to think.

672
01:36:34,002 --> 01:36:35,629
You can think inside.

673
01:36:40,142 --> 01:36:41,507
I'm sorry, Em...

674
01:36:42,944 --> 01:36:45,572
...but I'm afraid my traveling days are over.

675
01:36:45,881 --> 01:36:49,339
Divvy this up with the girls
and say goodbye to them for me.

676
01:36:53,155 --> 01:36:56,090
All right. Stay in Sandrock.

677
01:36:57,926 --> 01:36:59,154
And thanks.

678
01:37:01,296 --> 01:37:02,888
Thanks for nothing.

679
01:37:09,771 --> 01:37:10,760
Goodbye.

680
01:37:23,552 --> 01:37:26,680
- What happened to Trent?
- I gave him his walking papers.

681
01:37:26,922 --> 01:37:29,288
Em, do you mean what you're not saying?

682
01:37:29,391 --> 01:37:30,790
Every word of it.

683
01:37:30,959 --> 01:37:34,190
I'll buy San Francisco
and put it around your wrist like a bracelet.

684
01:37:34,262 --> 01:37:36,059
I'll put it in your hair like a crown.

685
01:37:36,131 --> 01:37:38,759
I've got a present for the girls
in the next car.

686
01:37:44,606 --> 01:37:48,508
Well, greetings from the Atchison,
Topeka and the Santa Fe.

687
01:37:49,878 --> 01:37:51,038
Hello.

688
01:37:51,246 --> 01:37:53,407
I bet we're going 40 miles an hour.

689
01:37:53,515 --> 01:37:57,110
We're getting further and further away
from Sandrock every second.

690
01:37:58,820 --> 01:38:00,219
Yes, I guess so.

691
01:38:00,288 --> 01:38:02,620
We should be in Flagstaff
in a couple of hours.

692
01:38:02,691 --> 01:38:05,182
Are you planning to stop there by the way?

693
01:38:05,994 --> 01:38:07,791
I'll stop there if he does.

694
01:38:07,896 --> 01:38:09,056
He?

695
01:38:10,565 --> 01:38:11,554
Who?

696
01:38:12,667 --> 01:38:13,793
Ned Trent.

697
01:38:14,469 --> 01:38:17,905
What are you going to do in Flagstaff,
wait on tables?

698
01:38:19,341 --> 01:38:22,071
I don't know, but I will if he wants me to.

699
01:38:23,111 --> 01:38:26,171
Look, would you accept an apology?

700
01:38:29,851 --> 01:38:32,684
I'm afraid that maybe I was wrong.

701
01:38:33,622 --> 01:38:37,683
I mean, you see,
I'm from a little town in Ohio.

702
01:38:38,427 --> 01:38:41,453
I probably acted like a snob
about girls like you.

703
01:38:41,596 --> 01:38:44,690
I mean,
what I thought girls like you were like.

704
01:38:46,134 --> 01:38:50,537
And after all, it's only a matter of style,
isn't it?

705
01:38:50,806 --> 01:38:53,832
I mean,
some people wear one kind of dress...

706
01:38:54,810 --> 01:38:56,971
...other people wear another.

707
01:38:57,879 --> 01:39:01,315
And this certainly is the barren...

708
01:39:02,083 --> 01:39:04,483
...blistered end of creation out here.

709
01:39:05,353 --> 01:39:06,752
I don't know.

710
01:39:07,055 --> 01:39:10,320
Maybe it's good for the men
to have a little entertainment.

711
01:39:12,394 --> 01:39:14,555
You mean you want to join us girls?

712
01:39:16,531 --> 01:39:18,123
I'd like to try.

713
01:39:19,267 --> 01:39:20,859
You'd do that for him?

714
01:39:22,971 --> 01:39:25,235
Well, that's what he wants, isn't it?

715
01:39:29,478 --> 01:39:31,537
- What?
- You're getting off this train.

716
01:39:31,613 --> 01:39:33,581
- No, I'm going to Flagstaff.
- You are.

717
01:39:33,648 --> 01:39:35,047
No, please, don't.

718
01:39:38,153 --> 01:39:40,519
I don't want to get off.
I'll go where he goes.

719
01:39:40,589 --> 01:39:43,456
- He's not on this train. Look.
- What's the matter?

720
01:39:49,664 --> 01:39:50,926
Thank you, Em.

721
01:39:52,601 --> 01:39:54,193
Goodbye, Susan.

722
01:39:55,504 --> 01:39:56,732
Goodbye.
