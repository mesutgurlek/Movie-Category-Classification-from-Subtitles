00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,129
<i>This is the last day of Carnaval. </i>
<i>Let your hair down!</i>

2
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:38,532
<i>Let's dance</i>
<i>and have a great time!</i>

3
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:42,964
<i>I say hello to Pelô,</i>
<i>Liberdade, Curuzu... </i>

4
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,701
<i>Piatã, Paripe, Peri-Peri!</i>

5
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:50,315
<i>We're still backing you up on</i>
<i>the last day of Carnaval in Bahia!</i>

6
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,077
<i>But pay attention</i>
<i>to this message:</i>

7
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,584
<i>Carnaval</i>
<i>is about peace and love!</i>

8
00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:00,249
<i>If you wanna screw, use a condom. </i>
<i>If you wanna drink, take a taxi. </i>

9
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,419
<i>Don't give violence a chance!</i>
<i>Let's enjoy in peace!</i>

10
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,794
<i>I'll be bringing you the hits</i>
<i>until the end of Carnaval. </i>

11
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:16,101
<i>It's summer in Bahia!</i>
<i>The sun is scorching!</i>

12
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,245
<i>Listen up now, men,</i>
<i>boys and girls. </i>

13
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:25,782
<i>Turn your stereo up!</i>
<i>"It's Oxum"!</i>

14
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:32,749
<i>In this city</i>
<i>Everyone is</i>

15
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,328
<i>Oxum's</i>

16
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,899
<i>Man, boy, girl, woman</i>

17
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:49,735
<i>Everyone radiates magic</i>

18
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,077
<i>Present in the fresh water</i>

19
00:01:55,281 --> 00:02:00,844
<i>Present in the salt water</i>
<i>And the whole city shines</i>

20
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:09,193
<i>Whether it is a lieutenant</i>
<i>Or the son of a fisherman</i>

21
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:15,926
<i>Or an important judge</i>

22
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:23,673
<i>If they are there</i>
<i>They are the same everywhere</i>

23
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,811
<i>The force</i>
<i>That resides in the water</i>

24
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:34,783
<i>Does not differentiate by color</i>
<i>And the whole city is Oxum's</i>

25
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,052
<i>The force</i>
<i>That resides in the water</i>

26
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,630
<i>Does not differentiate by color</i>
<i>And the whole city is Oxum's</i>

27
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,828
<i>Oxum's</i>

28
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,699
<i>Oxum's</i>

29
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,542
<i>Oxum's</i>

30
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,248
<i>I'm going to navigate</i>

31
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:11,253
<i>I'm going to navigate On the waves</i>
<i>Of the sea, I'm going navigate</i>

32
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,051
<i>I'm going to navigate</i>

33
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:21,491
<i>I'm going to navigate On the waves</i>
<i>Of the sea, I'm going navigate</i>

34
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,930
<i>Oxum's... </i>

35
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,170
I need your services.

36
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,271
Tell me, honey,
how can I help you?

37
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,581
Paint me for Timbalada.

38
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,876
Look at this.

39
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,753
"LOOK AT THIS"

40
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,870
Hey, Cosme,
where is Damião?

41
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,735
Don't!
You little pest!

42
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,183
<i>Walking down the hillside</i>
<i>Easygoing</i>

43
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,151
Get out of here,
you little devils!

44
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:33,757
The devil is everywhere,
Dona Joana!

45
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,951
FORTUNE TELLER
What a group of ugly misfits!

46
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:41,163
Hey, witch! What's all that smoke?
Are you smoking pot, huh?

47
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,062
What a mouth!
Leave me alone!

48
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,464
When the police
start shooting...

49
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,231
I hope you get hit
by a stray bullet!

50
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,534
Go take a shit!

51
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:57,178
I wanna know where you'll make
your potion, you fake witch!

52
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,481
Leave me alone!

53
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:04,812
Get ready.

54
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,977
- You both took so long.
- The sermon was really long.

55
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,981
- Yeah? Tell me about it.
- It was nice. Really nice.

56
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,417
- But what did he talk about?
- He talked about a lot.

57
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,953
Come on, boy,
what did he say?

58
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,618
- He talked about the cross.
- The cross.

59
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:45,059
About the cross?
On the last day of Carnaval?

60
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:50,827
Jesus nailed to the cross, people
down here celebrating Carnaval.

61
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,369
That can only be a sign...

62
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,869
to warn me to keep you
locked up at home...

63
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:02,536
far away from this shameful
cross that Carnaval is!

64
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,409
- Hallelujah! Jesus!
- Hallelujah!

65
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,050
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

66
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,015
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

67
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,020
Not again...

68
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,193
Right in the middle of Carnaval
she decides to shut down the water!

69
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,988
For God's sake,
turn it on, Joana!

70
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,665
Turn the water on,
for Oxalá's sake!

71
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:24,303
Calm down, sister.
The pump's broken.

72
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,734
If I didn't shut it down,
there's no way I can turn it on.

73
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,634
Leave me be!

74
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,299
There's nothing broken.
Don't I know you?

75
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,242
Give me a break!
Damn woman!

76
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:39,542
- Hey, Neuza, what's up?
- I see you're slutting around.

77
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,982
- Come on, it's Carnaval!
- It's Carnival!

78
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,019
You haven't met Rosa,
have you?

79
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:47,192
She's the daughter of a friend of mine.
She'll stay here for a while.

80
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,951
She's a great dancer from Juazeiro,
you know.

81
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:52,562
Dances like hell.
This is Roque, Rosinha.

82
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,290
First-rate painter.

83
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,299
Poet and talented singer!
Right, buddy?

84
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,676
Roque! Roque! You're late!
Let's go! It's on the other side!

85
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,310
You're staying here?

86
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,912
- Hey, Neuzão.
- You're pushing it.

87
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:13,043
- You're pushing my patience.
- Who's the honey, Neuzão?

88
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,549
- She's my God-daughter.
- Hi.

89
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,278
Daughter of my midwife.

90
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:21,051
- Don't look at her, Reginaldo.
- Your nipple is showing.

91
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:30,060
Listen... if you need me to paint
you again, let me know.

92
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,896
It's all included.

93
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:37,299
- It is, huh?
- Everything.

94
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,385
Hey, Roque,
hey, Reginaldo...

95
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,952
I'm not gonna stand there
just like a palm tree!

96
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:55,423
- Get this fag outta here!
- I'm not a fag, I'm a woman.

97
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,756
- Blessings from your auntie.
- Let's scram!

98
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,934

<i>Your stare makes me halt</i>

00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:50,401
What y'all have to say!
If you're from the slums, say it!

151
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,727
If you're from the slums, say it!

152
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,137
<i>If you're from the slums, say it!</i>
<i>I am</i>

153
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,333
<i>If you're from the slums, say it!</i>

154
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,040
<i>If you're from the slums, say it!</i>

155
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,350
I'll get it, Mom.

156
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,323
- Who's there, Damião?
- It's a message from the Church.

157
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,658
- For me?
- No, for us.

158
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,263
For us. They tell us to go take part
in a praying session...

159
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,337
in front of the house of a girl
who's been possessed.

160
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,236
Praise Jesus!
Tie up the evil!

161
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:33,138
- Let me go, mom, tie up the evil.
- You...

162
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,608
are so little. How can you
tie up the evil, my son?

163
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:40,513
- I can do it.
- You guys make me laugh.

164
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,289
All right, you can go.
But come back straight home. Hey!

165
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,322
Come back here!

166
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:52,463
Where do you think you're going
without your Bibles?

167
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,325
That's a good one,
"tie up the evil".

168
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,689
You pests!
Get out of here!

169
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,253
- Good morning, Reginaldo.
- Good morning, Maria.

170
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:55,621
I'm livid! You know that crab
upstairs turned off the water again?

171
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,490
- You're acting up on me again, right?
- Me?

172
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:03,566
What the heck have you been
planning in that head of yours?

173
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:07,535
Because now you leave one morning,
you come back the next day...

174
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,935
and you even carry your damn
toothbrush in your pocket?

175
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,734
Are you crazy, Maria?

176
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:14,242
I got here late last night,
came into the kitchen...

177
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,074
made noises and all and you
never woke up! So I just sat here.

178
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:21,845
Do I look like a toilet to eat all
your crap? That's gotta be it!

179
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:25,922
Maria, come on.
You are my wife, I love you.

180
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,286
You're the mother of my kid.
You're my main office!

181
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,052
Your main office?
No main office...

182
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,388
no branch,
and no vending station!

183
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,565
You keep wandering
around the house.

184
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,532
Your taxi is at the body shop,
falling apart. You don't care.

185
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:41,137
Maria, that taxi is dead and buried!
Get over it!

186
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,741
The plate is all that's left,
and I'll use it on a friend's car.

187
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,775
- I start today.
- My God!

188
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,140
You're involved with gangs.

189
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,009
Who said anything about gangs?
The guy's a cop.

190
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,706
- A cop, Reginaldo?
- A policeman.

191
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,749
Reginaldo,
what damn car is that?

192
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,750
- It's a Quantum.
- What?

193
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,356
A Quantum.
And to keep the car for good...

194
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,719
I have to wet
the cop's hand.

195
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,293
You know what I was thinking, honey?
Sit here. You know what?

196
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:08,523
We could take that
house at Urbes...

197
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,565
...and give it to him.
- Give it to him? You're not giving it...

198
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,499
selling it, nothing!
I have nothing to do with it!

199
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,503
The Quantum
of the car is yours!

200
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,472
The organized crime
was committed by you!

201
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:22,113
Reginaldo, I've already told
everyone we're leaving this place!

202
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:26,648
- What am I going to say...
- Let her go alone, Reginaldo!

203
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,013
- Look at this.
- You have to scream!

204
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:32,122
She's up there,
eaves dropping!

205
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,350
I'm gonna buy an iron
and burn out your eyes!

206
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,029
- Careful, Maria, the baby.
- Reginaldo...

207
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,791
you'd better solve your problem,
and get outta my face!

208
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,196
What the hell, Maria!

209
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,068
Don't touch it, boy!

210
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,538
Go!

211
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,411
- How much is the umbu?
- R$ 1.50.

212
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,551
- And the serigüela?
- R$ 1.50.

213
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,482
- And the acerola?
- R$ 1.50.

214
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,318
Have you lost anything here?
Don't come hounding my stand.

215
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,494
- We're hungry.
- Don't you have food at home?

216
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,391
- No. We haven't had breakfast yet.
- That's awful.

217
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,400
- This umbu is rotten.
- Take it and get outta here.

218
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,231
- Leave now!
- Thanks! May God help you!

219
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:39,354
Auntie, don't you have any nuts
that fell out of the bag?

220
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,682
Aren't you two Joana's kids,
Cosme and Damião?

221
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,259
- We are.
- We are.

222
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:46,788
- How do you know our mother?
- From the Church. Praise the Lord.

223
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:49,796
I remember you.
I think we met before.

224
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,733
- Does your mother know you're here?
- She knows. She knows.

225
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,271
Haven't you heard?
My mother is sick.

226
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,701
- Really?
- She fell sick.

227
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,776
- She's sick.
- Oh, my God.

228
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,709
She told us to go buy
some stuff at the market.

229
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,473
Here.

230
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,617
She won't be at the church.

231
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,915
Share the nuts.
Take this to your mother.

232
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,888
Tell her it's from Dalva.

233
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,618
- God bless you.
- May God help you.

234
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,489
Amen, you too!

235
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,164
Good morning, Jerônimo.

236
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,769
- Good morning, officer.
- How are you doing?

237
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,274
I wanted to talk to you.

238
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,306
May I sit so we can talk?

239
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,637
- Please.
- Excuse me.

240
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:40,343
You know, Jerônimo, I'd like
to talk about the money I owe you.

241
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:44,852
What can you do for me?
I'm late on rent this month.

242
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,389
I have 5 children, as you know.
Maybe you could...

243
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,085
All right, all right.
Feel at home

244
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,161
I know you cops
are fucked.

245
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,433
Your salary is crap, right?

246
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,099
- That's right.
- You're just like toilet paper:

247
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,935
When you're not tied up,
you're blotched with shit.

248
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:12,279
Let's forget about that.
You can pay me with other deeds.

249
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:16,145
You know those kids
that fool around my store?

250
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,186
- Yes.
- I want you to give them a scare.

251
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,349
Got it.

252
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,486
Don't worry.
As far as I'm concerned...

253
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,824
your shop will be protected.

254
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,898
You do that.
You do that.

255
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,797
Thank you, Jerônimo.
Have a good day.

256
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:38,565
- This is Saint Sebastian.
- Hi, Jerônimo...

257
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,109
do you have any money for me?

258
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,678
Excuse me.

259
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,108
- God bless you.
- Amen.

260
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,249
Transition period, 18th...

261
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:01,724
Are you all set, Peixe Frito?

262
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:06,057
Yes, the bottles are loaded,
at your request.

263
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:11,230
- People will only drink your coffee.
- But keep your mouth shut, Peixe.

264
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,564
If you tell anyone,
I'm fried, and so are you.

265
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,241
My lips are sealed, Boca.
I won't say a word.

266
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,239
I'll fry you!

267
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,842
Dona Joana, come on in!

268
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,537
- Good morning, Jerônimo.
- Good morning.

269
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,649
Would you like some coffee?

270
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,581
Thank you,
but I can't stay long.

271
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:32,587
Won't take a second.
Maria José, bring us some coffee!

272
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:37,861
Jerônimo, your store looks great,
so full of things!

273
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,327
This time of the year,
so many ships arrive.

274
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:41,965
We must have variety.

275
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:46,126
Like this silver crown,
from the 18th century.

276
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:50,798
- Truly beautiful, Jerônimo.
- Excuse me.

277
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:55,002
- Coffee's here.
- The best coffee in Bahia.

278
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,540
Jerônimo,
I never said anything...

279
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,719
but something about
you amazes me.

280
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,477
Until this day...

281
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,180
you wear your late wife's
wedding ring.

282
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,791
Well...

283
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:14,127
when we love someone so deeply,
like I loved my late wife...

284
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,197
...that love clings to us for life.
- I know...

285
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:20,200
but, nowadays,
people don't care about that.

286
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:25,568
Nowadays, all they care about
is being naughty.

287
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:28,041
- The world is doomed, Dona Joana.
- You're right about that.

288
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:31,875
But I must go now,
I can't stay.

289
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:35,110
- Thank you very much.
- It's early still.

290
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,321
No, I have to go.
I'll come back some other time.

291
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,788
- You owe me another visit!
- Of course!

292
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,156
Good-bye.

293
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,955
- Lúcia?
- Sir?

294
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:49,099
- Go get an abará for me, please?
- Right now?

295
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:52,532
Yeah, I got up early today
and I'm hungry.

296
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:56,799
But no chit-chat on the hill,
or you'll be here tomorrow!

297
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:58,635
Don't worry.

298
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:02,380
- Roque Nascimento dos Santos!
- What's up, Boca?

299
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,338
- Is it safe?
- Yep.

300
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:07,117
- Straight?
- No way, man.

301
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,685
Straight business
is for the fool, right?

302
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,755
Dude, you and Reginaldo
really fucked me over.

303
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,085
It was the last time.
I just did it...

304
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,488
because Reginaldo
was in need.

305
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:20,563
Cut the crap. Show me
the shit you got, Saint Roque!

306
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:25,931
Here, I don't want to brag, it came
out sweet. Check the stripes.

307
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,172
Nobody will say
they're fake.

308
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:36,745
I hope Reginaldo
won't have any problems.

309
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,177
It looks like a real taxi,
doesn't it?

310
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,786
It's the spitting image!

311
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:47,122
- Look, don't fuck me up.
- Come on, brother.

312
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:51,056
Are you Bahia
or are you Vitoria, Afro?

313
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,959
Are you crazy, man?
Let go.

314
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,997
- Where are the trolleys?
- There.

315
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,902
Why the hell you care
for selling coffee on a trolley?

316
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,471
- Mind your business.
- Such a small business.

317
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:06,132
You can make some money during
Carnaval. So, are they ready, bro?

318
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,574
Almost.
I just need to install the...

319
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,214
What time did I ask them for?

320
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,441
- Boy, it won't take long.
- Five o'clock!

321
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,711
- Right?
- Calm down, brother.

322
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,617
Don't be a frigging nigger
and botch things up, brother.

323
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:21,122
I'm not your brother, or boy...

324
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:23,419
and you're the one
botching things up here!

325
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,892
- Come on boy, I'm joking with you.
- Fuck this shit!

326
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:29,123
- Calm down, my brother. Nervous?
- Brother...

327
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,802
I already told you I'm not your
brother, my brother. Are you deaf?

328
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:32,992
You're deaf.

329
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:35,532
You bastard.

330
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:40,667
The deal was to deliver them at 5.
They'll be ready, if you pay.

331
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,642
I only took this job,
worked all night along...

332
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:45,510
to buy my
fucking costume.

333
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,643
5 o'clock I'll be back
to get my fucking trolleys.

334
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,682
My brother.
Watch out, my brother.

335
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,396
This fucking Pelourinho
is full of crazy people.

336
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:02,089
You hit one of them,
I bet The Human Rights shows up.

337
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,815
Hi-quality! What's up?
What's the matter?

338
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:22,953
Your friend Roque can't take a joke?
What a hothead!

339
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:26,214
That's how artists are.
They're born with that anger!

340
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,722
- Fuck his anger.
- What have you done to him?

341
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:32,363
Nothing.
But I should have.

342
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:33,292
Take a look.

343
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,591
- My brother!
- But that's the thing.

344
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,132
The deal is 50/50
of what you get each day!

345
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:43,205
Greedy, huh?
No way, sir. That's mine.

346
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:47,609
- Forget about Roque, Boca.
- Go fly a kite, man.

347
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,249
- Good day, Baiana.
- Carmem, you're so dressed up!

348
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,946
You look like
a laundry donkey.

349
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:03,491
I'm going to pick up Psi, my sister.
She's coming home from abroad.

350
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:07,256
And that bitch Joana
shut the water again.

351
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:10,059
That woman is nasty, girl.

352
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:14,534
Baiana, are you going
to do that little job for me?

353
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:18,197
Have you ever seen a fag
become a man?

354
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,103
Not even an Orisha God
can fix that, Carmem.

355
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,908
Let me remind you both...

356
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,175
that your rent is due today.

357
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,943
And let me remind you...

358
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,985
that we don't
have any water.

359
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:35,091
That's how Carnaval is, honey,
bad things happen.

360
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:38,490
Check these out:
Three stiffs.

361
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:42,389
- They look like Faustina's sons.
- What do I care about her sons?

362
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,967
I care about mine, woman.

363
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,537
If you popped it out, raise it!
I take good care of mine.

364
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,302
They're on a short leash.
I'm very strict.

365
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:57,208
And when Mario's back, he will see
I did a good job with our kids.

366
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,280
And all by myself.

367
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,083
"When Mario's back".
Once away...

368
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,380
who would be crazy enough
to come back to this bitch?

369
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:17,534
- Good afternoon.
- What are you doing here, Joana?

370
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,534
Well, same as you:

371
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,900
Fulfilling
my duties with God.

372
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,770
If you're sick, you have no
obligations to the church, no ma'am.

373
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,605
Who's sick here, woman?
What are you talking about?

374
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,281
I saw your boys in the market
earlier today...

375
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,475
and they told me you
delirious with fever.

376
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:37,519
- I was so upset.
- Say what, Dalva?

377
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:42,159
Like I said. They told me they
were there to buy things for you.

378
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,421
- Dalva, say that again.
- Just like I said, Joana.

379
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:48,690
- Like you said, huh?
- That's right.

380
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,390
We'll see.

381
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,176
No.

382
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,013
Hey, you!

383
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:09,747
Give me two reais.

384
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,046
- Two?
- Yeah.

385
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,417
- Give me one.
- He just wants one.

386
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,450
You sister won't recognize
this place. Everything's changed.

387
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:20,893
In the old days, black folks
would come and just party.

388
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,727
Now, with the white folks,
it's all about...

389
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:27,530
...feeling people up till morning.
- Jesus Christ, Baiana.

390
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,297
Was I talking to you?

391
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,975
Girls, now Pelourinho is fancy!

392
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,776
I say that
because you know. Pelourinho...

393
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:37,504
was one
of the last hideaway for niggers.

394
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,576
- What the hell you saying?
- Pelourinho now is ACM:

395
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,810
Action, Competence and Morality.

396
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:47,515
And it is all covered in Barbie pink.
Isn't that fabulous, Baiana?

397
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,023
What do you think,
you cheap abortionist!

398
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,422
Why, dear,
do you need my services?

399
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:53,096
Me? No way.

400
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,526
And don't you grow all big on me...

401
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,257
because everybody here knows...

402
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,868
that you've forgotten garden scissors
inside a woman belly!

403
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,101
What the hell
are you saying about me?

404
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:03,533
Everybody here knows your womb
looks like a sieve now...

405
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,210
because of all the
gringo babies you've aborted!

406
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,141
Did you hear that, Baiana?
She's got a venomous tongue!

407
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,975
Listen, girl, you want me
to throw a fit right here?

408
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:15,619
I won't give you that pleasure.
I'm not going down to your level!

409
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,152
Baiana,
I'll be back when she leaves.

410
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:19,118
Now there's two.

411
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:20,756
What fuss is that with
your name, Carmem?

412
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:24,759
Can you believe that? A low-life
like her trying to ruin my name.

413
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:28,296
Look, this chick is crazy.
She loves trouble. Stay away.

414
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,060
- I know that. I know.
- Stay away.

415
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,034
- Hey! What's this, Carmem?
- There he is.

416
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,139
You letting your sister wait,
with a suitcase in her hand?

417
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,669
Go!

418
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,776
What a fucking
disaster this guy.

419
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,674
What a fucking piece of crap,
let me tell you something.

420
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,819
- The abará, Baiana?
- Be patient.

421
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,546
I ain't no McDonald's joint.

422
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:10,489
Do you want this?
I'm all woman, come check it out.

423
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,727
Go home, man.
Go home, you fag.

424
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:16,839
Can you believe this fag?
He has no... Go rest!

425
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:24,709
Shit!

426
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:28,251
I talked to my friend,
and you can collect cans tonight.

427
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:30,353
Last day of Carnaval,
but what can you do?

428
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:33,648
You have to be licensed to do that,
but he's sick, so I got his.

429
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,491
Show! Show!

430
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,418
- God bless you, Roque.
- I've been waiting for that.

431
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,723
Bow look,
I will go get us some food.

432
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:41,921
Show.

433
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,358
Show.

434
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:48,605
- A customer, Ma, a customer.
- Hold on, son. Hail Mary.

435
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,980
Forget it, Ma.
It's Roque.

436
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,819
It's you, Roque?
Come on in.

437
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,511
The smell of your food
guided me here.

438
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:07,316
I have to tell you something.
Cut the sweet talk.

439
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:08,719
- What?
- Have you seen...

440
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,987
...that trash in the hallway?
- You, too?

441
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:15,529
You're a psychic,
you should care for him.

442
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,598
Me, care for that garbage bag?

443
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:21,795
The poor boy makes no harm.
What about the one upstairs?

444
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,940
- I don't know.
- She turned off the water again.

445
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,902
I'm loving it,
you hear, sister?

446
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,136
I don't know why I'm shouting.

447
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,009
At this time,
that bitch's at the fucking church!

448
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:34,446
Just talking about it
gives me the creeps.

449
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:37,120
She's been on my case, Roque...

450
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:38,914
but let me tell you:
I won't leave...

451
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,217
...and God won't get me out of here!
- I make mine your words.

452
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,054
I'm not leaving either,
you know why?

453
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:47,425
- Why?
- Because of your food.

454
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,362
- Dear Lord!
- Stop that nonsense, boy.

455
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,559
Let me tell
you one thing, Roque:

456
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,829
It's hard for me
to buy food.

457
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,099
I can barely feed myself and
Raimundinho. Look how thin he is.

458
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,271
I can't be feeding
your little bum friends too.

459
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,380
Mother Raimunda, what's enough
for three is enough for four.

460
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:06,948
It's all about the heart
of the cook behind the door.

461
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,280
See you later!

462
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,389
Look at this.
Be that way.

463
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,055
- Jesus loves you!
- Jesus heals you!

464
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,556
- He frees you!
- He frees you!

465
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:20,288
- And bans devil!
- And bans the devil!

466
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,487
Get up, you devil!

467
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:22,859
Get up!

468
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,364
Leave her body!

469
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:25,900
Leave her body!

470
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,629
Out, you devil!
Out!

471
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,105
Leave, devil!
Leave! Leave! Leave!

472
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,835
Lord of glory, hallelujah.

473
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:43,310
You're free now, thanks to
the glory of Lord Jesus Christ.

474
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,011
Hallelujah, Lord!

475
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,691
Dear sister,
let me ask you something:

476
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:50,622
Dear sister,
have you ever used drugs?

477
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:52,193
No, sir.

478
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,426
- Have you participated on Carnaval?
- No, sir.

479
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,260
- No, she's a righteous girl.
- Praise the Lord!

480
00:33:57,468 --> 00:34:00,232
How has the devil
seized her soul?

481
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:01,564
Let me tell you:

482
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:05,368
This girl used
to be nervous and impatient.

483
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,067
Her family, in order
to help her...

484
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:11,112
resorted to the so-called Orishas!

485
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,077
In the name of Jesus,
protected us.

486
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:16,776
And what are the Orishas?

487
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:20,617
The Orishas are shapes
assumed by the devil...

488
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:23,521
to snatch the souls
which belong to Jesus.

489
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,196
What about Carnaval?
And what is Carnaval?

490
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,423
It's the different forms
assumed by the devil...

491
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,932
to steal thousands of souls...

492
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:34,627
which belong
to Lord Jesus!

493
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:55,624
Carmem!

494
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:02,930
I missed you so much, my sister!

495
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,897
I can't believe you're here!

496
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,872
I love those Bamboo trees.

497
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:13,043
There's nothing
like that in the world.

498
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:16,213
- Really, Psi?
- Not even in Paris.

499
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:19,381
- You look prettier, Psi!
- I do, don't I?

500
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:20,949
- Fabulous.
- What did you say, Reginaldo?

501
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:23,882
This car, it is fabulous.

502
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:27,385
It's my life abroad.
I eat well...

503
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:31,551
live well,
riding on a plane everywhere...

504
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:36,665
Woman, cut it out! I heard
you were washing dishes in Europe.

505
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,098
Look at this.
People can't stand other's success.

506
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,133
No, they can't.

507
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:41,965
- Sorry.
- That's gossip!

508
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:45,609
Gossip from those who have never
been on a plane, had any snails...

509
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,778
or a dab of caviar.

510
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,539
Of people who stayed here and
ended up expelled from Pelourinho!

511
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:53,216
- It's pure envy!
- Never mind, my sister.

512
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:56,284
All right,
tell me about your foreign lover.

513
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:01,050
You tell me about your life,
Carminha. How are the kids?

514
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:04,285
The kids are fine.
I've got 7 now.

515
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,827
- Seven!
- All grown up, at school.

516
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:08,362
- Remember the twins?
- The twins.

517
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:09,965
They're playing Olodum.

518
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,567
- Olodum.
- Yeah.

519
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:15,569
And I've adopted a little girl.

520
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:17,434
So beautiful!
I'm mad about her.

521
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,202
- How lovely.
- But you wouldn't believe.

522
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:23,676
She was all covered in pustules.
I took care of her...

523
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:27,146
and now the mother wants her back.
But I won't let it happen!

524
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,285
I sure know you.
Your husband?

525
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,648
I couldn't bear him anymore.
Sent him off.

526
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,188
- Alone again?
- I'm a hard working woman.

527
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:37,384
I don't care what people say,
I know what I do is important.

528
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:40,462
It's not my fault people screw
around and I have to fix the job...

529
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:44,897
God himself set up
for those miserable people.

530
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:49,403
I have a soul,
I'm not like Him.

531
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,838
And I even gather the stray sheep
He leaves behind.

532
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:58,407
Well, for me, you have
always been much more than that!

533
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,879
More than a mother.

534
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:08,418
Thank you, Reginaldo.

535
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:12,687
Very emotional!

536
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,257
Tell me, Psi.
Tell me about the gringo.

537
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:21,928
Carmem...
I'm dying for an acarajé!

538
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,004
So early in the morning?

539
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,768
Desire never sets up a time, Carminha.

540
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:29,806
Isn't that so?
You're right, Reginaldo.

541
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,811
- Take us to the Baiana.
- Let's go, then.

542
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,946
Fuck!

543
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,153
How do you like that?

544
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,764
<i>- Come friend, fight</i>
- Check this out!

545
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:51,161
<i>Come, friend, fight</i>

546
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,393
<i>Come, friend, fight</i>

547
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,573
<i>Come, friend, help us out</i>

548
00:37:56,774 --> 00:38:00,574
<i>Or we'll end up losing</i>
<i>What we already won</i>

549
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,106
<i>Or we'll end up losing</i>
<i>What we already won</i>

550
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:09,411
<i>Come, friend, fight</i>

551
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,820
<i>Come, friend, fight</i>

552
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,820
<i>Come, friend, fight</i>

553
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:17,660
<i>Come, friend, help us out</i>

554
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:21,628
<i>Or we'll end up losing</i>
<i>What we already won</i>

555
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:26,731
<i>Or we'll end up losing</i>
<i>What we already won</i>

556
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,536
<i>Come on</i>
<i>Get up and fight</i>

557
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,409
<i>Come on</i>
<i>Get up and help</i>

558
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:35,943
<i>Come on</i>
<i>Get up and shout</i>

559
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:40,616
<i>Come on, get up now</i>
<i>Life doesn't stop</i>

560
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,749
<i>Life doesn't stop there</i>

561
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,251
Hey, Baiana!

562
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:50,860
Where's Mateus?
Won't you say hi to me?

563
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:53,162
Hey, Maria, is this baby
coming out or not?

564
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:56,527
Not now! I'm 7 months now
and look how big I am.

565
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:57,723
- Looking good!
- Ain't it?

566
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:00,301
- It took you so long today, Roque.
- I was working.

567
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,166
But coming by here is a must.
That's how I unwind.

568
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:04,432
- Check it out, Roque.
- Yeah?

569
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,940
Three corpses. Don't
they look like Faustina's kids?

570
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:09,578
This is never gonna change.

571
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,839
It seems like God
has forgotten this place.

572
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,880
He has turned his face
a long while ago.

573
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,682
What are you talking about?

574
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:19,322
I'd like to go sightseeing.
You busy today?

575
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,889
Not anymore.
What time?

576
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,651
Three o'clock, is that okay?

577
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,326
I'll be back!

578
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:31,662
Delicious!

579
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,301
Huh!

580
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:43,502
What the fuck!

581
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:51,212
Baiana, Maria,
do you recall Psi?

582
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,287
Hey, Baiana, hey, Maria.

583
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:54,958
Looking good.

584
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:58,355
Baiana, please, I'd like an acarajé
with everything on:

585
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:01,429
Caruru, vatapá, shrimp,
lettuce and a lot of hot sauce...

586
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:04,032
to kill this burning desire.

587
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,295
And please
spread on my acarajé...

588
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:11,373
a little bit of this mustard.
I'm addicted to French mustard.

589
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,942
Who told you I'd have acarajé now?
It's available in the afternoon.

590
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,478
Baiana, my darling,
give me a break.

591
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:20,514
I just arrived from Switzerland
and the first thing I wanted to do?

592
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,653
- To eat acarajé.
- No chance at all.

593
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:25,719
I'll pay in Euros!

594
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,481
Get a grip, my child.

595
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:31,122
Here, take a look:
Three stiffs!

596
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:35,289
- Carmem, stiffs?
- A murdered kid.

597
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:40,061
Hello, we haven't met yet.
How are you? My name is Lúcia.

598
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,368
Don't bother, honey,
I speak the language. "Piacere".

599
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:47,473
- Nice to meet you. Psilene.
- I overheard you.

600
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:49,475
You have been in Europe?

601
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,411
Miss Psilene,
I've done everything to go abroad.

602
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,450
I studied English,
got a passport...

603
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,554
bathed in leaf infusions,
but nothing!

604
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,417
Right, right.
Listen, love.

605
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,616
You don't need all that, you don't
even need to speak English.

606
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:08,288
You know what? What gringos
like is big butts...

607
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:12,196
and big boobies. You know, boobs
like this, with a lot of silicone.

608
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:13,427
Silicone?

609
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,070
That's fancy!

610
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:16,465
Can you tell me how...

611
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:19,336
Lúcia, your abará is ready.

612
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,635
How efficient.

613
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:23,502
I'm sorry.

614
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:26,215
- I'll talk to you later.
- Sure.

615
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,951
Bye, darling.

616
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,211
What an immature girl, Baiana?

617
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,589
Know what
she will do abroad?

618
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,349
Wash dishes for gringos...

619
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,789
be a nanny to gringo kids...

620
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,462
get laid with gringo men!

621
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,130
After they're done with her...

622
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,994
they'll send her ass
back to Brazil, if that much!

623
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:46,999
Otherwise, she will have
to work her ass off...

624
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:50,833
as a hooker, in order to save
some money to come back home!

625
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,872
So tell me,
why did you come back?

626
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,475
Baiana, when the acarajé is ready...

627
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,739
tell Zinho to take it down
to Neuzão's bar.

628
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,143
It's gonna take a while.

629
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:04,048
I'll wait for this acarajé,
just like one waits for Jesus!

630
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:09,056
Jesus, on my baking dish?
I'm not worthy!

631
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:14,723
This is the Carmo Convent
built on the 16th century...

632
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:18,493
when the Portuguese
arrived here in Bahia.

633
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,364
Portuguese arrived in Bahia.

634
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:24,405
Now they are returning,
recovering everything.

635
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,473
Come back, the Portuguese.

636
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:31,011
They're coming back to the wonderful
land they have once discovered.

637
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:34,673
And who wouldn't, tell me?
Who wouldn't?

638
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,886
- A toast to Psi!
- To Psi!

639
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:43,153
- Hi, Neuza.
- Will you excuse me?

640
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,454
Teacher! I wanna talk to you.

641
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,529
- You look cute. For Carnaval?
- You like it?

642
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,462
- It's nice.
- This is serious.

643
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:54,695
After Carnaval, I'm going
to pass a petition around...

644
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,338
for the Vivaldo
Costa Lima School.

645
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,336
No need to go any further.

646
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:01,409
I'll sign
it in any way you want...

647
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:04,911
...whatever you want.
- Dona Neuza, please.

648
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:08,244
- Hey, Matias.
- Hey, Teacher.

649
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:11,387
Look, Matias, I've got
a petition here for the Vivaldo...

650
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,454
I'm not signing
no fucking petition!

651
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:16,524
You teachers go on strikes
all year around.

652
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,456
My kids go to school to study.

653
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,596
- Oh, yeah?
- Not my fault you make no money.

654
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:22,493
You get paid to teach...

655
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,167
not to hang out
here in the bar.

656
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:28,031
I'm not hanging out, I'm being
yelled at by an ignorant stupid man!

657
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:31,765
- Fuck, I'm not...
- Don't you go yelling in my bar!

658
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,035
Get the hell out of here,
damn it!

659
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:38,772
Look how upset she is now. Rosa,
get the teacher a soda. Have a seat.

660
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:41,315
Good afternoon.
Neuza, where are my oysters?

661
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:43,645
I got only sprats, man.
Things been tangled here!

662
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:46,379
- What the fuck, Neuza?
- I told you I'm stressed, man!

663
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,354
- Neuzão, my friend.
- Reginaldo, my man!

664
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,720
- My brother!
- Where is the cab?

665
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:52,793
It's out there.
Take a look.

666
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:54,025
Neuzão!

667
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:57,290
- Hi, miss thing!
- Hi, Big Beyoncé.

668
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:59,832
Looks who's in the house!

669
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:02,402
<i>What's up, Neuzão</i>
<i>Let me make a proposal</i>

670
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:05,006
<i>Don't know if I can</i>
<i>Don't know if I do</i>

671
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:07,871
<i>To make a gig</i>
<i>Right here for you</i>

672
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:10,837
You know what, Raimundinho?

673
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:13,812
I'm still conquering costumers.
I can't.

674
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:15,815
Are you pulling my leg, Neuzão?

675
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,920
What are you doing there,
Beyoncé?

676
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:20,389
- Measuring the room.
- Measuring the room?

677
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:22,684
You crack me up.
Go ahead, my brother.

678
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:26,021
C'mon, everybody!
One, two, three.

679
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,035
<i>I'd like to know</i>
<i>Where she's now</i>

680
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:43,111
<i>If she thinks about me or not</i>

681
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,804
<i>Oh, Lord</i>
<i>Oh, Lord</i>

682
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,985
<i>I wanna give her all my love</i>

683
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,586
<i>My life, my heart</i>

684
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:52,948
<i>I want to please her</i>

685
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,183
<i>I wonder if I'm right?</i>

686
00:44:57,494 --> 00:45:00,588
<i>Or must I try to forget her?</i>

687
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,358
<i>Be here with me, darling</i>

688
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:06,127
<i>Oh, bring me, darling</i>

689
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:09,094
<i>Your sweet kiss, darling</i>

690
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:11,770
<i>Your sweet kiss, darling</i>

691
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,412
They have no shame, you see?

692
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:20,014
Such an old woman
behaving like that.

693
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,447
Lord will punish her.

694
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:26,245
<i>I'd like to know</i>
<i>Where she's now</i>

695
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:29,358
<i>If she thinks about me or not</i>

696
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,960
<i>Oh, Lord</i>
<i>Oh, Lord</i>

697
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:35,131
<i>I wanna give her all my love</i>

698
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:37,664
<i>My life, my heart</i>

699
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:40,530
<i>I want to please her</i>

700
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:43,364
<i>I wonder if I'm right?</i>

701
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,566
<i>Or must I try to forget her?</i>

702
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:49,471
<i>Be here with me, darling</i>

703
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:52,204
<i>Oh, bring me, darling</i>

704
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:55,311
<i>Your sweet kiss, darling</i>

705
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,079
<i>Your sweet kiss, darling</i>

706
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:05,928
Stop it now!
This is not a whorehouse!

707
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:09,930
I've warned you already!
You'd better scram!

708
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:13,035
Neuzão, so many customers.
500/0 of the cover charge.

709
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:17,037
Neuzão, I can see it now.
"Beyoncé and The Refugees".

710
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,573
Refugees?
Get the fuck out, Raimundinho!

711
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,438
Let's go, guys.

712
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:24,612
- Come over here, Roque.
- What's up, sweetie?

713
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:27,409
This is my sister, Psilene.
She arrived from Europe today.

714
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,609
Sweet.
Have you been away for long?

715
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,112
- So long I lost count of the days.
- Too long.

716
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:36,958
One day I will also
travel around the world.

717
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:39,823
Roque is a singer.
He sings like hell, Psi.

718
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,597
- Is that so, Roque?
- Modesty aside...

719
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,962
when I hold the mic,
the crowd goes crazy.

720
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,863
- Did you speak to Tatau?
- Tatau, the Araketu singer?

721
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:50,198
We grew up together at Tororó.

722
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:52,671
His fame hasn't changed him at all.
We are still friends.

723
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:54,374
- I'm sure.
- So, how did it go?

724
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:55,977
I sent him the song:

725
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,741
<i>Who told you Bahia</i>
<i>Is just about happiness</i>

726
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:03,319
- Let's see if he likes it.
- He sure will.

727
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,717
If Carmem says you're good,
it's because you are.

728
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:07,583
And listen:

729
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:09,483
When you become
a star in Europe...

730
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:12,924
I insist that you stay
at my place in Switzerland.

731
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,190
Ah, thanks a lot.
Now, you hit it hard.

732
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,630
One must dream, right, Carmem?
It's only our right.

733
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:22,670
Psi is the dreamer one.
I'm alert even when I'm asleep.

734
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:26,301
Dream on, Roque, dream on.
You know why?

735
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,240
He who doesn't dream
won't ever board an airplane.

736
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:31,209
Virgin Mary!
Listen...

737
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:35,010
"I know I'm nobody
And I may never have everything...

738
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:37,881
Apart from that
I carry all the dreams within me"

739
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:40,052
How beautiful, Roque!

740
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:43,249
It's not mine though,
it's Fernando Pessoa's.

741
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,959
- Hey, girl.
- I changed it a bit.

742
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:46,291
Come over here.

743
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:49,932
- Fernando Pessoa?
- Excuse me now. And welcome!

744
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:51,462
My pleasure.

745
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,737
Sweet honey, would like to work
at my place, for 2 or 3 months?

746
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:58,169
Maria is going to have the baby,
and we need someone.

747
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,935
You can even sleep over,
if you like.

748
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:04,671
- Breakfast included and all.
- You think I'm easy, Reginaldo?

749
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,476
You like to play the macho, but we
know you like to fuck the faggot.

750
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:10,312
- And you like to "lick the carpet".
- Get him, godmother!

751
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,728
Calm down, Neuzão!
Relax! Relax!

752
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:26,097
Reginaldo!
You leave with me now!

753
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:29,534
That's right, I'm leaving.
I offered her a job...

754
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,970
and she thinks it's something else!
Bunch of ignorant people!

755
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:33,870
Fuck ignorance.
I'll cut you!

756
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,066
Fuck off!

757
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:37,006
See you at 3.

758
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,439
Reginaldo!

759
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:45,085
You're such a hit!
Three suitors as soon as you arrive.

760
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,951
- Three?
- The God-mother included.

761
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:53,525
How can the sun
fit into such a small sphere?

762
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:56,130
Beautiful. Loved that.

763
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:59,632
Did you? It's not mine.
It's Gregório de Matos'.

764
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,368
Only you.

765
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,505
For Carnaval
or for good this time?

766
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:04,435
You know I've been here before?

767
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:06,404
Every time you come,
I see you.

768
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,872
- Where?
- Around.

769
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:10,205
- You don't remember me?
- No, I don't.

770
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:11,640
Cool.

771
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:13,873
You don't remember me,
but I haven't forgotten you.

772
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,988
I came for good this time.

773
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:20,986
Juazeiro was too stifling.

774
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:22,556
Juazeiro?
Why stifling?

775
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,159
Everybody minds
other people's business.

776
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:28,626
Salvador is better, then.
Your secrets are safe here.

777
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,494
My godmother
told me you are a singer.

778
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:34,671
That's right. One day
I'll be as famous as Tatau.

779
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:37,095
Then sing something.

780
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,667
Only if you dance.
Aren't you a dancer?

781
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:43,837
Fair enough.

782
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,711
<i>I'm leaving</i>

783
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:55,647
<i>Disarmed</i>
<i>And in the chest a heart</i>

784
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:01,088
<i>I don't have anything</i>
<i>I'm leaving a dream</i>

785
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,593
<i>Emotional adventurer</i>

786
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:07,326
<i>I forget everything</i>

787
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,864
<i>To freely live</i>
<i>A new passion</i>

788
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:13,807
Are you with, Rosa?

789
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:17,809
<i>Wandering around</i>
<i>I find a world</i>

790
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,108
<i>With an open book</i>
<i>What?</i>

791
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:22,182
<i>Waiting for the lesson</i>

792
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,320
<i>It was for love</i>

793
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,751
<i>All this time I spent</i>

794
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:29,118
<i>Everything that happened</i>
<i>Made me feel</i>

795
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:32,295
<i>Moments of happiness</i>

796
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:36,088
<i>So far away</i>
<i>The longing raised the pain</i>

797
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,759
<i>A blind razor that love</i>

798
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:42,401
<i>Left behind</i>
<i>In pieces of kindness</i>

799
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,206
<i>So far away</i>
<i>The longing raised the pain</i>

800
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,640
<i>A blind razor that love</i>

801
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:51,245
<i>Left behind</i>
<i>In pieces of kindness</i>

802
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:54,277
<i>I am a pioneer in life</i>
<i>Everybody!</i>

803
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:56,475
<i>My love</i>

804
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,114
<i>I make pleasure the first</i>
<i>And you</i>

805
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:03,554
<i>Seduction</i>
<i>I want you with my entire body</i>

806
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:09,090
<i>So the dream</i>
<i>Conquers the moonlight</i>

807
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,464
<i>I am a pioneer in life</i>

808
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,195
<i>My love</i>

809
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,699
<i>I make pleasure the first</i>

810
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,308
<i>Seduction</i>

811
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,479
<i>I want you</i>
<i>With my entire body, Rosa</i>

812
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:27,344
<i>So the dream</i>
<i>Conquers the moonlight</i>

813
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:29,576
<i>Come, come,</i>
<i>Come and shake it, honey</i>

814
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:33,415
<i>Come, come</i>
<i>Araketu has it all</i>

815
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:34,954
<i>It has the gift</i>
<i>Of making eternal</i>

816
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:37,524
<i>Everything illuminated</i>
<i>For us to love</i>

817
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:40,161
<i>Come, come,</i>
<i>Come and shake it, honey</i>

818
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:43,196
<i>Come, come</i>
<i>Araketu has it all</i>

819
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,799
<i>It has</i>
<i>The gift of making eternal</i>

820
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:47,162
<i>Everything illuminated</i>
<i>For us to love</i>

821
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:50,134
<i>Come, come,</i>
<i>Come and shake it, honey</i>

822
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,773
<i>Come, come</i>
<i>Araketu has it all</i>

823
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:54,535
<i>It has</i>
<i>The gift of making eternal</i>

824
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:57,941
<i>Everything illuminated</i>
<i>For us to love</i>

825
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:00,580
<i>Shake it, honey</i>

826
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:02,346
<i>Araketu</i>

827
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,112
<i>Eternal</i>

828
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:08,157
<i>Illuminated</i>
<i>Love</i>

829
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,284
<i>Shake it, honey</i>

830
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:16,092
What block are you parading on?

831
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,697
Damn it.

832
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:24,240
- I'm on Araketu.
- Araketu, huh? Cool.

833
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:27,638
Yeah.
Every year, like a religion.

834
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:30,574
There's something everybody
does at the end of it all...

835
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:34,907
no matter what's your race or color:
Go to Castro Alves Square.

836
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:38,417
- Castro Alves Square?
- Castro Alves Square.

837
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:42,385
Whoever chooses not to may
be punished by the Orishas.

838
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,585
By the Orishas, right?

839
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,497
I wouldn't dare,
if I were you.

840
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:50,831
- Better not.
- Better not, man.

841
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:54,135
Bye now.

842
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:59,375
Reginaldo, I have so many orders...

843
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:02,170
that I don't even know
what to buy first.

844
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:03,471
Buy it all.

845
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,117
There is nothing worse to carry
on an airplane than a berimbau!

846
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:10,377
I don't know why Europeans
re so crazy about it.

847
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:12,953
I have to take 3.
Can you imagine it?

848
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:15,920
I can't imagine you leaving.

849
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:17,991
I won't miss
the berimbaus really.

850
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:22,495
- Reginaldo...
- Aren't you taking the berimbaus?

851
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:25,434
I'll buy at the airport...

852
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:28,126
so I spend the least time
possible with them.

853
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:32,206
- I see.
- Let's go, have lots to see today.

854
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,269
Hey, guys?

855
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:40,443
- So, making money with the gringos?
- Yes, we are.

856
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,515
We pose for pictures for a buck.

857
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,688
- You want to take a picture with us?
- Psilene...

858
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:49,086
they are Dona Joana's kids, owner of
the shared house. Cosme and Damião.

859
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:52,557
They are so cute.
How lovely!

860
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:54,423
Will you take a picture with them?
10 bucks.

861
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:56,098
Of course.

862
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:58,859
Cosme and Damião,
my patron saints.

863
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,037
Please, make it look good.

864
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,934
I'll treasure this forever.

865
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,835
Say cheese!

866
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,241
Thank you.
Here's the 10 bucks.

867
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:10,174
Listen.

868
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:14,111
Go have fun with it.
Thank you very much.

869
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:17,775
Go home!
Your mother's waiting!

870
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:21,413
The Lacerda elevator, Reginaldo.

871
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:23,115
- Beautiful, no?
- I missed it so much.

872
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:26,853
Geneva should have one of these,
to go up the Alps.

873
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:30,123
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Psilene...

874
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,529
you're a whole lot of woman.

875
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:35,569
No need for help to go up.

876
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:37,136
Check it out.

877
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,303
What a great view!

878
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:46,875
- Moisés, you scared me.
- Don't call me Moisés.

879
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:50,644
Nobody can know that's my name.
My name here is Boca.

880
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:52,822
- What is it, Boca?
- Brunette, be a doll...

881
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,723
and bring me a beer.

882
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:57,984
Don't bring me a flat beer.
I want it freaking cold!

883
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:00,526
Get the one at the bottom
of the freezer.

884
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,829
What's the matter?
Where have you been?

885
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:04,933
I had to stay away because
there was a situation, all right?

886
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,662
All right, but when you disappear,
I get insomnia.

887
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:10,737
I can't sleep, man.

888
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,734
What's that now?
Go to sleep!

889
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,967
You think I'm lying to you, huh?

890
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:17,078
You want me to put you to sleep?
I can sing you a lullaby.

891
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,577
You're mixing things up.

892
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:20,147
- Brunette, what's your name?
- Rosa.

893
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,012
Rosa, as in "rose".
Then go get me a pink egg.

894
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:25,847
I have to talk
to your godmother.

895
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:29,719
- What's your problem?
- I came here to tell you...

896
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:33,593
that you, baby...

897
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:35,361
that you...

898
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:39,826
are the only person who cares
for me in the whole Pelourinho.

899
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:41,194
Really, Boquinha?

900
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:43,599
Now, you're gonna
make me cry.

901
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:51,278
- This pink egg is awesome.
- Awesome.

902
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:52,611
Shit, the shell.

903
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:55,246
- It's great today.
- Better peel it first.

904
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:57,543
The chicken
lays eggs this pink?

905
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,187
Now, you are pushing it.

906
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,057
Good afternoon, my darlings.

907
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:07,759
- Good afternoon.
- Did you pray a lot?

908
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:10,626
- Too much.
- My arms are tired.

909
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:13,894
The demon didn't want
to leave the girl's body.

910
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:17,039
Really?
In fact, it's really hard...

911
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:20,175
to remove the father of the
lies out of a child's body.

912
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:24,040
- Pretty hard.
- That's right. Your mother here...

913
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:26,681
has a solution
that's better than praying.

914
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,647
- Yeah?
- Yeah, a good beating, well done...

915
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:33,448
to remove Satan from you brats!

916
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:36,989
Get 'em Yolanda!
Cosme! Damião!

917
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:39,218
- Get 'em, Yolanda!
- Calm down, Joana!

918
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:43,023
How can they do that?
They lied to God, to everyone!

919
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:46,464
And they even
used my name to do it!

920
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,101
You were used, honey?

921
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:51,773
Show me some respect.
Get out now.

922
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:56,207
Give me a bucket of water.
I'm all sticky!

923
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,881
Pay the bill and a waterfall
will pour down on you.

924
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:02,483
Can I pay in my usual way?

925
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:07,883
I have new spicy stories
that will blow your mind!

926
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:13,188
Really? But not today,
I'm too upset for that!

927
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:16,422
You'd better leave
before I get mad at you too.

928
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:19,534
I'll tell you all later, woman.

929
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:23,271
Dollar, please. Dollar, please.
Money, money.

930
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:26,704
Get out of here, come on!

931
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,777
Look at this. It's like this
every day in Pelourinho.

932
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:31,173
Look at this.

933
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:33,975
It's no use! I've told them
to stay away! They won't listen!

934
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:36,084
Where's public safety
when we need it?

935
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,810
I've told you already.

936
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:39,181
Say the word...

937
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:41,880
and I'll become a bouncer for you.

938
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:45,026
If the traders down the street
do this, it's their problem.

939
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:47,389
I pay tax so that
I'm entitled to public safety.

940
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:49,622
You know I can't
stay here all day long.

941
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,563
You promised you were going
to find a solution, so do it!

942
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:00,066
Light it up somewhere else.
I have no lighter.

943
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:01,368
- Daddy.
- Boca.

944
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:05,742
- Give me a coffee, will you?
- Will do. It's really warm.

945
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:09,350
- Sweet little TV you got there.
- That's the marketing business.

946
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:11,452
- Have you made up your mind?
- Definitely.

947
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,679
You'll sell my stuff tonight?

948
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:16,825
I'm out, Boca.
I've got a wife and kid.

949
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:18,653
You don't know what
a family means, but I do.

950
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:19,920
You're fucking lazy, man.

951
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:23,257
You sent the cat after the mouse
and then you eat the cheese.

952
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:26,526
What's your problem, Boca?
Come on. Sorry, but I can't.

953
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:29,000
Raimundinho!
You mother's looking for you.

954
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:31,730
- Here comes the monkey of Pelô.
- Hey, Boca!

955
00:58:32,408 --> 00:58:35,844
- The sheep.
- Your true herd, Boca.

956
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:39,276
How'd like to sell some "candy"
at the parade?

957
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:42,110
- Are you mad, Boca? No way?
- You're the mad ones...

958
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:45,651
making 14 bucks to hold
that damn rope all night.

959
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:49,256
Boca, we just wanna score!
Get the girls, kiss their lips.

960
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,825
You don't score!
Go get your hair cut!

961
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,895
What hair cut?
Scram, brother.

962
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:58,928
Too many saints around here.

963
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:08,808
Get yourself some rest, Lia.

964
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:11,879
- Take good care of yourself.
- Okay, Carmem.

965
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:14,579
I'm not partying tonight.
I don't feel so good.

966
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:17,719
You said that 3 months ago,
on your last time here.

967
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:20,185
Don't worry, Carmem.
I'll pay attention.

968
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,051
You have to pay nothing!

969
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:26,524
You gotta wrap his dick with latex,
condom!

970
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:28,525
It costs a pittance.

971
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:33,225
- Use your head!
- Use my head? No.

972
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:36,030
You know how much I like men.

973
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:39,206
- Maybe too much.
- Just don't do it anymore.

974
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:43,869
I won't be able to help you out
again until you're legal, Lia.

975
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,672
Yeah, I know.

976
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:49,014
Here you go.

977
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:53,749
Thanks a lot.
Bye.

978
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:55,747
You're welcome, Lia.

979
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:02,497
- Do you think this is right?
- Mind your own business!

980
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:05,996
It should be mummy.

981
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:09,195
- Hi, Carmem.
- Did they give you a hard time?

982
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:12,135
They're used to me by now,
you know that.

983
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:16,142
Hold on.
Hold on, I'll give you your pay.

984
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:18,243
No need for that, Carminha.

985
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:23,147
Sure, right. Let's go home.
I have to change for the parade.

986
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:25,651
- Thank you, Rai.
- I fixed them all up, hair and all.

987
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:29,723
They're gonna look great tonight!

988
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:07,721
<i>To this corner of the world</i>

989
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:11,457
<i>Where is it coming from?</i>

990
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:17,294
<i>From my profound dream</i>

991
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:23,335
<i>Or from the depths of the sea</i>

992
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:27,173
<i>With what voice will you sing</i>

993
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:30,008
<i>With what light will you shine</i>

994
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:34,280
<i>It will come</i>
<i>Be that as it may</i>

995
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:39,685
<i>To this corner of the world</i>

996
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:44,629
<i>Where is love coming from?</i>

997
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:11,892
<i>In this empty life</i>

998
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:17,454
<i>What's taking</i>
<i>My honey so long?</i>

999
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:22,498
<i>An immense gladness</i>

1000
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:28,277
<i>Being saved for whom?</i>

1001
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,207
<i>Be it an angel of the sky</i>

1002
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:35,212
<i>Or a monster of the sea</i>

1003
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:39,252
<i>Coming in flying saucer</i>

1004
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:43,784
<i>But I know that it is mine</i>

1005
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:46,291
<i>The moment I see it</i>

1006
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:50,023
<i>For the biggest enchantment</i>

1007
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:56,037
<i>In this corner of the world</i>

1008
01:02:57,373 --> 01:03:00,706
<i>When is love arriving?</i>

1009
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:06,876
<i>My</i>

1010
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:11,683
<i>Love</i>

1011
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,555
<i>My</i>

1012
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:23,194
<i>Love</i>

1013
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:29,634
- I'm off, godmother.
- You look really nice.

1014
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:32,637
I gotta go cause I got paint
my body before the warm up.

1015
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:36,204
That's a pretty short skirt
you have, Rosa!

1016
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:53,061
- You look gorgeous, Neuzão.
- I do, don't I?

1017
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:56,459
Fab! Listen,
can I still have a drink?

1018
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,531
I was about to close.

1019
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:02,229
You'd better pay up front.
I'm only doing this because it's you.

1020
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:05,601
I know, my friend,
for old times' sake.

1021
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:07,173
Our consideration,

1022
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:12,306
When we cannot
put out the body's fire, Psi...

1023
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:15,746
...light up the soul.
- You know it all.

1024
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:18,248
I'll have a double, Neuzão!

1025
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:21,790
Miss thing,
it's so damn hot!

1026
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,858
What the hell?
You can't just barge into my place.

1027
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:26,426
- What you're so upset about?
- I am!

1028
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:29,189
I'll leave, then.

1029
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:32,359
Honey, tell me something.
Where's Regi?

1030
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:35,901
Regi? His name
is José Reginaldo.

1031
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:38,869
You'd better come off it,
because he's my burden!

1032
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:42,442
He took me from my house!
So get the hell outta here!

1033
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:45,808
You keep on yelling, sweetie.
That's why Regi seeks me.

1034
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:47,380
- What?
- You know why?

1035
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:50,950
He likes a woman
who knows how to make to love.

1036
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:53,383
- Not like you, chatterbox!
- Get outta here!

1037
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:55,113
You scum! You pest! Out!

1038
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:57,189
Out! Out!

1039
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:02,059
Boca is coming.

1040
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:04,328
Get the trolleys, boys.

1041
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:05,693
No one touches anything.
The money first.

1042
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,995
Okay, cool.
Let's talk, brother.

1043
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:10,104
My car was nearly towed when
I parked up there...

1044
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:11,432
you know.

1045
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:13,370
The cops came,
stopped me, and I said...

1046
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,407
"Come on, you!"
So I had to grease...

1047
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:17,408
the cop's hands.
Know what I mean, old chap?

1048
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:20,978
I've only got
half of the money.

1049
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:23,674
I pay the rest in 5 days.

1050
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:25,751
I hope you understand.
In 2 days max...

1051
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:27,479
I'll give you the rest.

1052
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:30,056
No way, Boca.
A deal is a deal.

1053
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:31,988
You take the trolleys if you pay me.

1054
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:33,183
That was all very clear.

1055
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:35,296
Can't you see it's not
my fault, brother?

1056
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:36,487
Not mine, either.

1057
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,167
Pay what you owe me
or you get nothing!

1058
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:41,495
What am I gonna say to these
kids' mom? Step inside, boys.

1059
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:43,865
What am I to say
to their mothers?

1060
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:45,563
The boys need to work.

1061
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,710
- You got no heart, man?
- Good one.

1062
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:52,574
- Does the devil have a heart?
- Brother, I'm begging you!

1063
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,477
Tell me why I should help you!

1064
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:57,084
You come here, you mock me,
now you want me to help you?

1065
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:58,651
Why would I do that?

1066
01:05:58,854 --> 01:06:02,620
What if one of these boys
you treat like slaves...

1067
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:04,087
didn't pay you?

1068
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:05,123
What would you do?

1069
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:07,489
You say that
because you're black...

1070
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:09,824
'cause you never had a break!

1071
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:12,330
Now, you wanna
make money this way?

1072
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:14,230
I've had enough of your scorn.

1073
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:16,837
To endure is my race's faith.

1074
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,597
I want all the money now.
Try and get the trolleys out.

1075
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:19,797
You're an asshole.

1076
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:22,136
- I follow your example.
- What example? You're a nigger!

1077
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:26,075
A nigger, a nigger,
a nigger, all right?

1078
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:28,546
You're a nigger, a nigger, a nigger,
a nigger, a nigger...

1079
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:32,243
- A nigger!
- Yes, I'm black...

1080
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:34,980
but doesn't
a black man have eyes, Boca?

1081
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:38,217
Doesn't he have hands,
a dick, five senses, Boca?

1082
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:41,225
Doesn't he eat the same food?
Doesn't he have the same diseases?

1083
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:43,660
Doesn't he need the same cures?

1084
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:49,429
When we sweat, isn't our body wet
just like the body of a white man?

1085
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:52,539
When you prick us,
do we not bleed?

1086
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:55,074
When you tickle us,
do we not laugh?

1087
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:59,304
When you shoot at us,
do we not die?

1088
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:03,542
If we are the same all over,
we are the same here too, damn it!

1089
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:13,519
Fuck you!

1090
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:15,026
Fuck your poetry.

1091
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:17,495
Raimundinho, please,
if your guys work for me...

1092
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,396
I'll double any offer!

1093
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:23,299
Get the trolleys.
You work for me now, all right?

1094
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:25,565
Go ahead, get a move.

1095
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:26,799
Here's your fucking money, man.

1096
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:28,399
- Son of a bitch!
- Get...

1097
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:30,135
the damn trolley, boys!

1098
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:32,405
- Just take them!
- Take your trolleys.

1099
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:33,809
Come on, get a move on!
Move your asses!

1100
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:36,177
Move, move, go!
Move your asses!

1101
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:38,444
- Let him take it.
- Get a move on. Out.

1102
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:40,713
Get out!
Scram!

1103
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:43,690
You cheap bastard.
Bastard.

1104
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,019
Unbelievable!

1105
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:50,156
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.

1106
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:51,799
- Whatever you need...
- Cool.

1107
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:54,936
For God's sake! Thanks, you guys!
Thank you, brother!

1108
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:56,968
Thank you, guys!

1109
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,434
- Lf you need us...
- Cool.

1110
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:03,641
- Good afternoon, Maria.
- Don't talk to me.

1111
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:05,507
- How come?
- You left saying...

1112
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:07,409
...you were going to get your cab.
- I did.

1113
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:09,345
I saw you dancing with a guy.

1114
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:11,645
What's that, Maria?
You misunderstood.

1115
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:12,980
- Wasn't everybody dancing?
- That's right...

1116
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:15,521
everybody was dancing, Reginaldo.
Everybody was dancing...

1117
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:18,818
but he came here
and called you Regi.

1118
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:21,758
You're a father.
You should show some respect!

1119
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:23,693
You're going to believe
what people say now?

1120
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:27,528
People, Reginaldo?
He come here in my house...

1121
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:29,533
and told it to my face, in my house
that you slept with him.

1122
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:30,898
- What?
- Yeah.

1123
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,802
He will get it!
I'll show him right now!

1124
01:08:33,008 --> 01:08:35,875
Reginaldo, you're gonna
leave your house...

1125
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:37,841
to settle a matter
with a faggot?

1126
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:39,036
You stay there...

1127
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:41,307
or you gonna have it too!

1128
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:42,506
You're gonna get it!

1129
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:45,209
- Dear Lord!
- I'm a man!

1130
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:46,649
What are you thinking?

1131
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:51,523
- You there?
- Come on in, it's open.

1132
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,891
- You fuck!
- Come here!

1133
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:56,394
Why on earth did you
go to my house...

1134
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:58,191
go my wife
and wag your damn tongue?

1135
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,594
- Me?
- No, my mother!

1136
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:00,530
I'm warning you:

1137
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,337
It was the first and last time
you go around...

1138
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:04,267
telling things to my wife!

1139
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:06,640
What is this, Reginaldo?
You think you scare me?

1140
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:07,570
Well, you don't.

1141
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:09,004
Bug off,
don't come here bother me...

1142
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:10,872
or I'll slash your mug!

1143
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,138
I'll cut your nuts off first!

1144
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:14,339
My ass.
I'll tell you why you are angry.

1145
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:15,482
Why are you so angry?

1146
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:17,083
Because when
you come home drunk...

1147
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:18,548
...where do you sleep? Tell me.
- Easy.

1148
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:20,779
- Where do you fuck?
- Hold it, hold it!

1149
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,185
You'd better stop fighting!

1150
01:09:23,392 --> 01:09:25,690
- It's him, Dona Joana!
- This is a family.

1151
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:28,386
I want no trouble
in my building!

1152
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:33,762
Trouble is what you're gonna get
if you don't release the water.

1153
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:38,338
Turn it on now!
Turn it on now!

1154
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,812
Let's open it ourselves!

1155
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:52,653
What's this?

1156
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:56,619
You look like the police.
Are you gonna murder me now?

1157
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:59,226
You know what?
Today is Carnaval...

1158
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:01,157
and you cut off the water!

1159
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:05,157
Know why?
The water bill is right here...

1160
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:06,994
and so far, nobody...

1161
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:12,698
Actually... actually...

1162
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:16,173
Roque, there's some water
here for you.

1163
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,675
What do you mean?
He is the only one with money?

1164
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:23,984
He's the only one who pays?
Open it now!

1165
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:25,744
Don't you see what's going on?

1166
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:28,753
- She only cares for men.
- That's right!

1167
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,755
Now, I understand.

1168
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,518
You stand there,
pretending you're a saint...

1169
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:35,595
...but your mind is perverted.
- Never!

1170
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:40,201
Wait, hold on, hold on. This is
not the way to solve a problem.

1171
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:42,836
- And how is that?
- We must use some diplomacy.

1172
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:45,331
- Reginaldo...
- Diplomacy.

1173
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:46,974
Let's talk.
Excuse us.

1174
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:48,473
Reginaldo, step aside.

1175
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:50,845
You guys love to make a fuss.

1176
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:53,173
Dona Joana, please.

1177
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:55,816
I know we care for each other.

1178
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:57,349
- A lot!
- So please...

1179
01:10:57,553 --> 01:10:58,918
turn the water on...

1180
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:02,420
so this creature
can have a shower. He stinks.

1181
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:06,320
Thanks to Roque and Reginaldo...

1182
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:08,428
...I'm turning it back on.
- Yeah!

1183
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:15,660
I'll spit on the floor and when
it dries out, I'll shut it down.

1184
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:22,108
- Yeah!
<i>- I'm going to shoot</i>

1185
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:25,838
<i>The one who's using my drawers</i>
<i>As a dish cloth</i>

1186
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:56,944
Let Jesus do His work.

1187
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,943
The Blood of Christ is powerful.

1188
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:40,487
Do you any need help, sister?

1189
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:44,591
- These cobblestones.
- Right, the stones.

1190
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:48,261
Carrying suitcases,
one may fald.

1191
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:53,067
Aren't you Carmen's sister,
the one living abroad?

1192
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:57,568
Are you the famous Dona Joana?

1193
01:12:57,773 --> 01:13:00,071
I know nothing about this fame,
my child.

1194
01:13:00,275 --> 01:13:02,709
It crossed the Atlantic Ocean!

1195
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:08,475
The Atlantic Ocean?

1196
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:10,743
That explains...

1197
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:13,387
that flood face of yours.

1198
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:18,049
- What I am is dizzy with exhaustion!
- I see.

1199
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,586
That's why I'm staying here tonight.

1200
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:25,528
My sister's house
is packed with kids.

1201
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:28,259
Your sister acts like a fool.

1202
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:31,928
She adopts kids
in a snap of the fingers.

1203
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:38,239
My sister,
Dona Joana has a huge heart.

1204
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:40,540
The house is tiny, though.

1205
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:46,051
Would you kindly have a place
I could keep my bags at?

1206
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:48,346
Only for tonight.

1207
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:20,148
Girl, where the hell
have you been?

1208
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:24,654
I was talking to Neuzão, and she...
You know how it is.

1209
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:28,591
I was waiting for you,
and you were with Neuzão?

1210
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:32,631
I was at the bar.
I lost track of time and I'm...

1211
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:36,532
...jet-lagged.
- Here. Here is your costume.

1212
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:39,972
- Let's go?
- I'm not coming, Carminha.

1213
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,944
I'm exhausted.
I left the bags at the hotel...

1214
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,272
but I'm staying here tonight.

1215
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:49,008
Go to a hotel if you never
want to see my face again.

1216
01:14:51,353 --> 01:14:53,583
My house is your house.

1217
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,189
Thank you.

1218
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:57,891
Cheer up, all right?

1219
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:01,151
- Cheer up.
- Enjoy yourself, love of my life!

1220
01:15:01,363 --> 01:15:02,387
I will.

1221
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:04,455
Bye.

1222
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:07,359
- Reginaldo.
- Dona Joana, what's up?

1223
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,929
Try to find my kids
while driving the truck.

1224
01:16:10,132 --> 01:16:12,657
- I'm really worried.
- Don't worry...

1225
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:14,802
if I spot them,
I'll send them straight home.

1226
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:18,063
Please do.
May Jesus bless you.

1227
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:19,467
Thank you.
Amen, Dona Joana.

1228
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:20,767
I have to hurry.

1229
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:22,637
Go, go.

1230
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:09,752
Only Jesus.
Only Jesus can work in your life.

1231
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:08,809
Honey, can you spare me your shirt
so I can get inside?

1232
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,609
Please, come on!

1233
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:13,546
Lord! Lord Black!

1234
01:18:13,755 --> 01:18:16,485
Put me in there, will you?
Come on, Lord.

1235
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,286
You're all puffed up because
you have a special place?

1236
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:26,499
I see you have no authority here.

1237
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:28,192
- I'll have to throw you out.
- That's right.

1238
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:30,428
- You're nothing but a doormat.
- Don't force me to throw you out.

1239
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:33,802
- You know better than touching me!
- Please leave.

1240
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:34,668
What's your problem?

1241
01:19:11,513 --> 01:19:13,242
Are you feeling better?

1242
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:17,544
Refreshed, Dona Joana.
Refreshed.

1243
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:19,983
Tell me,
is this building yours?

1244
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:23,521
Mine and my husband Mario's.

1245
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:26,359
We got here first.

1246
01:19:26,561 --> 01:19:30,827
This was all abandoned,
crumbling to pieces.

1247
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:32,158
Mario decided...

1248
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:36,098
to ask everyone who lives here
now to help him out.

1249
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:40,035
How nice,
everyone taking part.

1250
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:42,676
No way, my child,
he did it all by himself.

1251
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:45,403
I remember it very well.

1252
01:19:45,747 --> 01:19:50,377
When it was over,
all the lazy trumps moved in.

1253
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:53,354
And where is your husband?
Has he passed away?

1254
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:59,357
Please, don't say that.
God forbid.

1255
01:19:59,728 --> 01:20:03,459
- Amen.
- Mario is alive and kicking...

1256
01:20:03,832 --> 01:20:07,063
and I miss him a great deal,
let me tell you.

1257
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:11,766
- You do miss him.
- Yes, but he's coming back.

1258
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:15,033
He's solving a family problem
in the country...

1259
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:17,404
...but he'll be back soon.
- He will.

1260
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:19,876
Now you tell me...

1261
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:23,847
what's your foreign husband like?

1262
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:29,484
Dona Joana, he's much better
than I could ever imagine.

1263
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:35,460
- It's just like in the movies.
- Tell me all about it.

1264
01:20:35,864 --> 01:20:40,028
When I first got there, Dona Joana,
and I saw that mansion...

1265
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:43,466
I had to pinch myself.

1266
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:48,068
The garden, the living room,
the dining room,

1267
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:51,803
the library, the home theater,
the fireplace.

1268
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:55,779
My bedroom alone
looked like a palace.

1269
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:59,976
Now, tell me, my child,
what's it like with a foreign man?

1270
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:02,290
How's the thing?

1271
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:06,184
- You wanna know about the...
- Yeah.

1272
01:21:06,394 --> 01:21:08,419
Ah, Dona Joana...

1273
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:15,467
it's just like the others.
A little more gentle, romantic.

1274
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:20,670
When he wants it, there's
no holding him back, you know?

1275
01:21:21,343 --> 01:21:27,373
He comes near and whispers
in your ear, in a moan.

1276
01:21:27,749 --> 01:21:31,378
"Je t'aime, mon amour".

1277
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:34,248
Je t'aime.
Viens, mon amour, viens. "

1278
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:38,756
Jeez, girl, you sent shivers
down my spine!

1279
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:43,192
- Now, I feel like I want to...
- Like you want what?

1280
01:21:43,798 --> 01:21:47,199
I feel like meeting Carminha and
the twins at the Olodum. Let's go?

1281
01:21:47,502 --> 01:21:49,299
No, my child, I'm not going.

1282
01:21:49,504 --> 01:21:52,302
I'm a religious lady.
I don't like the Afro blocks.

1283
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:55,772
I'll stay here,
waiting for my kids.

1284
01:21:55,977 --> 01:21:59,242
But when they get home,
they'll get it. They'll get it hard.

1285
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:03,907
- Soften this heart of yours,
- Not this time, my child.

1286
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:05,915
I'm off then.

1287
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:09,181
Life is short
and time won't wait for me.

1288
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:12,488
Thank you very much.
Delicious coffee.

1289
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:16,323
I wonder.

1290
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:21,361
The woman travels abroad
and comes back such a wreck.

1291
01:22:21,836 --> 01:22:24,634
"Je t'aime.
Viens, mon amour. "

1292
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:24,831
Give it, give it.

1293
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:28,261
- Come on, hurry up. Let's go.
- Take it, take it.

1294
01:23:28,937 --> 01:23:30,564
- Hurry, hurry.
- Stop.

1295
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:32,433
Hurry, boys!

1296
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:50,324
Take it, take it.

1297
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:52,153
Hurry! Hurry!

1298
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:01,561
It's the cops!

1299
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,361
Look who's here:

1300
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:38,869
My old friend!
We grew up together at Tororó!

1301
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:41,008
He's a talented brother.

1302
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:44,645
Roque, come up here, brother.
Come on, brother!

1303
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:47,311
You, Roque, come on up!

1304
01:24:47,515 --> 01:24:52,111
Brother Roque!
Dude, come sing with me! Come on!

1305
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:55,653
It's been so long, man!

1306
01:24:58,493 --> 01:25:01,587
This is a good friend from Tororó.

1307
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:07,232
Hello, Salvador!

1308
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:11,098
We're gonna shake this place!

1309
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:14,937
Move your feet, come on!

1310
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:21,709
Show me!

1311
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:28,312
<i>I cannot hide</i>
<i>What I feel for you, Ara</i>

1312
01:25:28,523 --> 01:25:31,321
<i>I can't</i>
<i>I can't, I can't, I can't</i>

1313
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:35,622
<i>I cannot hide</i>
<i>What I feel for you, Ara</i>

1314
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:37,991
<i>I can't</i>
<i>I can't, I can't, I can't</i>

1315
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:39,223
<i>All I know</i>

1316
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:43,268
<i>Is that my body shakes</i>
<i>My legs don't answer to me</i>

1317
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:45,769
<i>We have to dance</i>
<i>It's subconscious</i>

1318
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:49,967
Smart one!
Since he was a little boy!

1319
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:53,777
<i>All I know</i>
<i>Is that Araketu is too good</i>

1320
01:26:06,594 --> 01:26:09,586
Show me how you do
your samba now, come on.

1321
01:26:11,599 --> 01:26:13,396
That's right!

1322
01:26:16,204 --> 01:26:18,502
He knows it all!

1323
01:26:19,607 --> 01:26:23,543
<i>I cannot hide</i>
<i>What I feel for you, Ara</i>

1324
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:25,872
<i>I can't</i>

1325
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:30,080
<i>I cannot hide</i>
<i>What I feel for you, Ara</i>

1326
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:33,283
<i>I can't</i>
<i>I can't, I can't, I can't</i>

1327
01:26:33,488 --> 01:26:35,683
<i>All I know</i>
<i>Is that my body shakes</i>

1328
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:37,619
Go, people!

1329
01:26:38,626 --> 01:26:40,787
<i>It's subconscious</i>

1330
01:26:41,663 --> 01:26:45,326
My old time friend,
from my neighborhood!

1331
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:48,502
<i>- All I know</i>
- Hands in the air!

1332
01:27:02,517 --> 01:27:06,214
Hands in the air!
Wonderful, Roquinho!

1333
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:09,655
Thank you very much,
thank you.

1334
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,667
<i>I cannot hide</i>

1335
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:27,670
- Feel fresh now?
- Absolutely. I'm going to bed.

1336
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:30,036
Could you do me a favor, please?

1337
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:32,236
At this hour?

1338
01:27:32,447 --> 01:27:36,907
You know my kids
haven't come home yet.

1339
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:38,517
Of course I know it.

1340
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:41,553
I saw you wandering
around the door.

1341
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:45,988
That's right.
Do me favor, then, for God's sake.

1342
01:27:46,194 --> 01:27:48,628
- Check your shells, will you?
- What, Joana?

1343
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:51,128
Please, please.

1344
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:55,294
What did I tell you?
What was our deal?

1345
01:27:55,503 --> 01:27:58,438
Not the local ones.
We take care of those!

1346
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:01,074
We'd talk to their mothers, uncles.

1347
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:02,675
We'd do something!

1348
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:07,312
If the community
finds that out, I'm fucked.

1349
01:28:07,515 --> 01:28:10,143
Jerônimo, I've done this
for more than ten years.

1350
01:28:10,351 --> 01:28:11,545
I do it well.

1351
01:28:11,753 --> 01:28:13,380
Is this what you call well done?

1352
01:28:15,923 --> 01:28:18,585
My shells!
My shells are sizzling.

1353
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:21,193
My hands! My hands!
My hands are burning.

1354
01:28:21,396 --> 01:28:25,594
What's that on your dress?
Your dress is red. Red. And you!

1355
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:29,099
Leave! Get out!

1356
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:31,397
I don't want you here!

1357
01:28:31,606 --> 01:28:34,370
I don't want you here!

1358
01:28:36,911 --> 01:28:39,072
I don't want it!

1359
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,544
This is not for me!

1360
01:28:41,749 --> 01:28:44,217
I don't want it no more!

1361
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:47,479
No! No,
I don't want it no more!

1362
01:28:53,094 --> 01:28:55,585
- Dona Joana.
- Jerônimo!

1363
01:28:55,797 --> 01:28:59,130
Jerônimo,
read this here for me, please!

1364
01:28:59,534 --> 01:29:02,332
I'm very nervous.

1365
01:29:04,072 --> 01:29:07,303
Just read it, Jerônimo.
Read it.

1366
01:29:08,776 --> 01:29:12,109
Just read it.
Just read it, Jerônimo.

1367
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:15,315
"Ten black boys in a cell...

1368
