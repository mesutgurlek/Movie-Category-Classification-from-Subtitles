1
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,731
Oh, hello there, honey!

2
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:58,743
- Nice to see you!
- This is my son.

3
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:02,178
How do you do?
Dorothy, this here's Gil Warren.

4
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,744
- Hi.
- It's so good to see you.

5
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,152
Don't worry, Gil.
She's just shy.

6
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,956
I brought you some tea.

7
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,463
Look! Here they come.
Come on, they're coming!

8
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:43,248
Shh.

9
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,905
We're getting ready
to set the table.

10
00:04:00,973 --> 00:04:04,670
Take these checkers someplace else.
Here, you take these.

11
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,712
Come on, Henry, be careful.

12
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:10,112
Come on.

13
00:04:10,182 --> 00:04:14,710
- Oh, man, you always drop the checkers when I'm...
- That's the way you win!

14
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:23,088
Toto! Toto! Toto baby!

15
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:45,946
# Put your arms around me, child #

16
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:51,115
# Like when you bumped your shin #

17
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,217
# Then you'll know
I love you now #

18
00:04:55,294 --> 00:05:00,994
# As I loved you then #

19
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:05,025
# Though you may be
trying sometimes #

20
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:09,598
# And I need you
and you're not there #

21
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:12,644
# You know I may get mad #

22
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:15,009
# And turn away #

23
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,108
# But you know that I still care #

24
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:25,089
# Don't lose the feeling that we have #

25
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:30,925
# Don't lose the feeling
that we have #

26
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:34,659
# Though you're growin' older now #

27
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:39,227
# And I'm watching you grow #

28
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,139
# I know I make you
sad sometimes #

29
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:50,808
# And I see your feelings show #

30
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:54,284
# But one day I'll look around #

31
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,412
# Yeah #

32
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,357
# And you will be grown #

33
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:05,523
# You'll be out in the world
such a pretty girl #

34
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:09,090
# But you'll be on your own #

35
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:14,367
# And I'd like to know it's there #

36
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:20,345
# The feelin' that we have #

37
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:25,111
# Knowing that you
can come to me #

38
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:29,917
# Whenever you are sad #

39
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:35,154
# Child, I'd like
to know it's there #

40
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:40,722
# The feeling that we have #

41
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:45,827
# Don't lose the feeling
that we have #

42
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,337
# Don't lose the feeling
that we have #

43
00:06:48,372 --> 00:06:50,770
# Don't lose the feeling
that we have #

44
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:55,871
# Don't lose the feeling
that we have #

45
00:06:55,948 --> 00:07:00,817
# Don't lose the feeling
that we have #

46
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:05,880
# Don't lose the feeling
that we have #

47
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:10,622
# Don't lose the feeling
that we have #

48
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,687
# Don't lose the feeling ##

49
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,565
# Lose it #

50
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:20,662
# Lose it #

51
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:24,334
# I don't even know
the first thing #

52
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,313
# About what they're feelin' #

53
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:34,651
# What am I afraid of #

54
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,384
# Don't know what I'm made of #

55
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,894
# Can I go on #

56
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,022
# Not knowin' #

57
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:54,964
# Feelin', feelin' #

58
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,136
# Somethin' tells me
that it's more than I #

59
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:03,238
# Can deal with #

60
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:07,274
# Though I never knew the song #

61
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:10,686
# Some words still catch on #

62
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:15,386
# Like carin' #

63
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:19,124
# And sharin' #

64
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:22,725
# Being together #

65
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:26,430
# No matter #

66
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:30,032
# Can I go on #

67
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:34,205
# Not knowin' #

68
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,306
# Don't know what I'm made of #

69
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:43,219
# Why am I afraid of #

70
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:48,684
# Feelin' #

71
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,195
# Feelin' #

72
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:55,097
# If I dared to take a chance #

73
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,362
# Would someone #

74
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:05,935
# Lead me ##

75
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:09,370
Emergency snow alert is now in effect.

76
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:12,383
No automobiles are to be driven
without snow tires or chains.

77
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,079
Winds up to 45 miles per hour...

78
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:18,282
That was a great dinner, Emma.

79
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:24,294
- That baby!
- You're a grandpa!

80
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:27,594
- Our daughter's fine.
- Mmm.

81
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,134
But Dorothy.

82
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,864
Give her time, honey.

83
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:35,372
Give her time.

84
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:46,415
Those dishes
ain't gonna wash themselves.

85
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:51,518
Mrs. Warren's son
looks real fine, don't he?

86
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,483
Aunt Em, please,
no more matchmaking.

87
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:59,019
Did you make the decision
about that new school yet?

88
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,430
It's no decision to make.

89
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,264
But, honey, it's a chance
to teach in high school.

90
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:07,999
Get away from that kindergarten
once and for all. It's more money.

91
00:10:08,073 --> 00:10:12,100
But besides the money, it's a chance
for you to be with older students.

92
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:14,145
Almost adults.

93
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,273
- I like it with the kids, Aunt Em.
- I know you do, honey.

94
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:19,340
And you're a fine teacher.

95
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:22,444
But that's why I think you'd
enjoy teachin' high school.

96
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:26,150
Have a chance to be with
the students for four years...

97
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,284
...such an important time
in their development.

98
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:35,627
I'm really happy
with the kids, Aunt Em.

99
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,670
But you been there
for three years already.

100
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:43,504
It's time you got out of that sandbox and
into some new people, new neighborhood.

101
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:46,408
Girl, do you know you're
24 years old and you've...

102
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:49,606
Never been south of 125th Street?

103
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:51,876
Well, you haven't.

104
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,486
Oh, here we go again.
You get me so worked up...

105
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,546
...that I'm beginning
to sound like a Jewish mother.

106
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:04,187
I can't see how goin' south of 125th
Street ever made anybody's life better.

107
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,930
And you're never gonna know
unless you try, are you?

108
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:09,597
And you're never gonna know
unless you try, are you?

109
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:12,569
Come on, Aunt Em, let me do that.

110
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:15,299
Why don't you go in and relax?
I can do... Let me do that.

111
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:19,833
Listen, I know gettin' out
in that world ain't easy...

112
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:22,379
...leaving Uncle Henry and me.

113
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:25,382
But we'll always be here
for ya, Dorothy.

114
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,782
And whatever your fears are, well...

115
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:30,912
...they'll be defeated just
by facing up to 'em.

116
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:34,390
Now, you take that new job
and find a place for you and Toto.

117
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:37,860
It's time for you
to make a home of your own.

118
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:50,673
Toto! Oh! Toto!

119
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:55,644
Toto! Toto!

120
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:59,650
Toto!

121
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:04,780
Toto! Oh! Toto!

122
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:12,190
Toto!

123
00:12:12,263 --> 00:12:15,289
Toto!

124
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,562
Toto!

125
00:12:17,635 --> 00:12:21,196
Toto! Toto!

126
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,185
# La, la, la, la, la #

127
00:13:12,257 --> 00:13:17,354
# La, la, la, la #

128
00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:53,423
Toto! Where are you?

129
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:56,592
Toto! Toto! Toto! Toto!

130
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:58,636
Oh!

131
00:14:07,712 --> 00:14:10,203
Toto, Toto.

132
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:14,217
- Toto, Toto.
- To... To... Toto!

133
00:14:14,285 --> 00:14:19,245
- Toto, Toto. Toto, Toto.
- To... To... To...

134
00:14:21,626 --> 00:14:25,790
- Toto! -
Toto! - Toto!

135
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:28,128
- Toto! -
Toto! - Toto!

136
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:30,030
God, where am I?

137
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:33,434
Toto! Toto!

138
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:39,200
Toto! Toto!

139
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:50,720
Two, two, two, two,
two, two, two, two!

140
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:53,916
Two, four, six, eight!
Who do we appreciate?

141
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:56,085
No! No!

142
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,391
- Relax, Mama!
- We just wanna lay a little thanks on ya.

143
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:01,898
- What?
- You know, heavy on the gratitude department.

144
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:04,230
- Gratitude? For what?
- For curling the curse.

145
00:15:04,302 --> 00:15:06,566
- For leveling the leech.
- For killing our oppressor.

146
00:15:06,638 --> 00:15:08,902
Uh! I never killed
nothin' in my life.

147
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:10,304
- Never killed the point?
- A pint?

148
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,637
- A good story?
- The umpire?

149
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:13,199
- No!
- Never killed no time?

150
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:15,803
No, I told you!
I never killed nothin'!

151
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,815
Well, then, I think you graduated...

152
00:15:18,883 --> 00:15:21,443
...from the bush leagues
into the majors, girl.

153
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,544
Toto?

154
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:29,893
Can you dig this?

155
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:35,756
- Who is it?
- Ain't no more "is"!

156
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,801
Thanks to you, it's a "was"!

157
00:15:40,872 --> 00:15:43,636
- She was Evermean.
- The Wicked Witch from the East.

158
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,676
And they didn't
call her Evermean for nothin'!

159
00:15:45,743 --> 00:15:47,870
She was the parks department
commissioner!

160
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:50,005
Caught us paintin' on
her playground walls.

161
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:52,242
- Turned us into graffiti!
- And there we stayed.

162
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:55,650
- Flat, splat and stuck like that!
- Doomed as cartoons forever.

163
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,315
'Til you burned alphabet
through the sky and ended the curse.

164
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:03,156
- And the "curseress. "
- Givin' a new lease on life to us...

165
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:06,424
The Munchkins, most recently
referred to as the "cursees. "

166
00:16:06,497 --> 00:16:08,465
Toto.

167
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:11,127
Let's hear it for
Super Witch and her Wonder Dog!

168
00:16:11,202 --> 00:16:15,138
Two, four, six, eight!
Who do we appreciate?

169
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:21,844
Miss One!

170
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,623
Come to Mama,
you hot little digits!

171
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:38,685
Let me lay my 20-20s on ya!

172
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:41,129
Oh, how I love you!
Let me... Mmm!

173
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,102
Count the ways!
Oh, mmm! Mmm!

174
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,036
Innumerable blessings,
countless felicitations.

175
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,943
Thank you beyond number
and additional good stuff!

176
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:59,541
I didn't mean to...
I didn't mean to kill her.

177
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:02,381
Oh, don't be
all sixes and sevens, honey.

178
00:17:02,453 --> 00:17:06,890
You did the world a multitudinous
service by 86ing ol' Evermean.

179
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:10,086
Bottom line, honey,
this chick put the "ugh" in ugly.

180
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:15,922
But she sure had pretty shoes,
didn't she? Yah!

181
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:36,547
I don't want these shoes.
I wanna go home.

182
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:39,317
I wouldn't discount
those shoes, honey.

183
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,915
And don't ever take 'em off
until you do get home.

184
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:44,757
Remember Miss One told ya.
Oh, pardon me.

185
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:47,263
Miss One's the name
if you haven't guessed by now.

186
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:50,095
Numbers is my game
and now that you've freed us...

187
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:53,934
we can all go back to
runnin' our business, ahem.

188
00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:56,838
We can all go back to
runnin' our business.

189
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:59,934
We can all go back to
runnin' our business.

190
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:02,445
But where am I?
Where am I?

191
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:05,539
You're in Munchkin Land!

192
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:09,450
- The indivisible Land of Oz!
- Oz?

193
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:16,249
But where's my home?
Where's Aunt Em? Where's New York?

194
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:19,194
- New York?
- 433 Prospect Place.

195
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:23,927
Ooh! Four, three, three.

196
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:26,026
You wanna play more than
one number today, honey?

197
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:28,572
I got a freedom special,
three numbers for the price...

198
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:31,164
No, I don't wanna play any numbers.
I just wanna get home!

199
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:35,201
Oh, well, now that ol'
Evermean's number's up...

200
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:37,679
...that leaves only
three witches in Oz.

201
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:42,015
One, myself, but my powers
don't amount to much.

202
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:46,045
And number two, Glinda,
the Good Witch of the South.

203
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:50,117
Oh, she's a real star,
but you can hardly catch her in.

204
00:18:50,194 --> 00:18:55,655
And number three, the multi-horrored
Evillene, the Wicked Witch of the West.

205
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:59,328
Evermean's even uglier sister!

206
00:18:59,403 --> 00:19:02,304
But I don't think it'd be
a good time to ask her for a favor.

207
00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:04,372
So I figured the odds are only the Wiz
could cipher how to get you back to...

208
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:06,371
So I figured the odds are only the Wiz
could cipher how to get you back to...

209
00:19:06,443 --> 00:19:09,003
- Where'd you say that place was?
- The Wiz?

210
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:12,344
What's a Wiz?

211
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,850
What's a... What's a Wiz?

212
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:18,183
Oh, darlin', he's the ultimate.

213
00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:20,780
The "X" quotient, the new math.

214
00:19:20,858 --> 00:19:24,191
The common denominator,
the main man.

215
00:19:24,261 --> 00:19:27,822
The head honcho!
Bottom line, honey.

216
00:19:27,898 --> 00:19:30,992
Numero uno!

217
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:35,232
- Where is he? How do I find him?
- Catch this number, honey.

218
00:19:35,305 --> 00:19:38,297
# Sweet thing

219
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:42,243

225
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,566
# Who can give your wish

226
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:10,106
# He'll send you back

227
00:20:10,174 --> 00:20:13,541
# By runnin' magic through ya #

228
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,478
# All of his super power's his #

229
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:19,880
# Dot dot da dot da #

231
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:28,625

232
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:31,252
# In Oz #

233
00:20:31,328 --> 00:20:33,956

- # There's the way #

234
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:38,058
# To the Emerald City
That's not too far, is it #

235
00:20:38,135 --> 00:20:41,935
- # He's the Wizard #
- # Just take your dilemma, child #

236
00:20:42,005 --> 00:20:45,270
# And lay it on the Wizard #

237
00:20:45,342 --> 00:20:49,745
# He'll fix you a drink
that'll bubble and foam #

238
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:52,247
# Dot dot da dot da #

239
00:20:52,316 --> 00:20:57,219
# And in a flash
you will be home #

240
00:20:57,287 --> 00:21:00,415
- # He's the Wiz #
- # He's the Wiz He's the Wizard of Oz #

241
00:21:00,491 --> 00:21:04,587
- # He's got magic up his sleeve #
- # He's the Wizard #

242
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:07,061
# And you know without his help #

243
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:11,033
# It would be
impossible to leave #

244
00:21:11,101 --> 00:21:15,060
# Fantastic powers
at his command #

245
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:17,107
Whoo!

246
00:21:17,174 --> 00:21:22,441
# And I'm sure
that he will understand #

247

252
00:22:34,251 --> 00:22:38,278
Whee! Ooh!

253
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:45,760
Whee!

254
00:22:45,829 --> 00:22:47,763
He's the Wiz!

255
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:53,167
# Fantastic powers at his command #

256

# He's the Wiz ##

266
00:23:37,214 --> 00:23:39,580
But how do I get
to the Emerald City?

267
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,711
Count your blessings, cut your losses
and follow the Yellow Brick Road.

268
00:23:46,924 --> 00:23:49,722
- The Yellow Brick Road?
Yeah! The Yellow Brick Road!

269
00:23:49,793 --> 00:23:52,853
Yellow Brick. Toto!

270
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:57,629
Remember, don't ever take those shoes
off and watch out for the poison poppies!

271
00:24:05,976 --> 00:24:09,742
Wait.

272
00:24:14,584 --> 00:24:17,485
Miss One?

273
00:24:18,722 --> 00:24:21,714
Miss One?

274
00:24:24,461 --> 00:24:25,627
Miss One!

275
00:24:25,662 --> 00:24:26,458
Miss One!

276
00:24:30,434 --> 00:24:34,928
# There's a feeling #

277
00:24:35,005 --> 00:24:38,133
# Here inside #

278
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:41,735
# That I cannot hide #

279
00:24:41,812 --> 00:24:45,748
# And I know I've tried #

280
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:48,444
# But it's turning me #

281
00:24:48,518 --> 00:24:52,477
# Around #

282
00:24:57,127 --> 00:25:02,963
# I'm not sure that I'm aware #

283
00:25:03,033 --> 00:25:06,230
# If I'm up or down #

284
00:25:07,604 --> 00:25:10,004
# Or here or there #

285
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:14,942
# I need both feet
on the ground #

286
00:25:17,214 --> 00:25:22,447
# Maybe I'm just goin' crazy #

287
00:25:25,455 --> 00:25:30,449
# Lettin' myself get uptight #

288
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:37,999
# I'm actin' just like a baby #

289
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:46,432
# But I'm gonna be #

290
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:50,037
# I'm gonna be all right #

291
00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:56,141
# Soon as I get home #

292
00:25:59,256 --> 00:26:04,023
# Soon as I get home #

293
00:26:07,397 --> 00:26:14,360
# Soon as I get home #

294
00:26:16,807 --> 00:26:20,243
# In a different place #

295
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,244
# In a different time #

296
00:26:22,312 --> 00:26:27,215
# Different people around me #

297
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:31,848
# I would like to know #

298
00:26:31,922 --> 00:26:35,756
# Of their different world and how #

299
00:26:35,826 --> 00:26:40,195
# Different they find me #

300
00:26:41,264 --> 00:26:43,994
# And just what's a Wiz #

301
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:47,230
# Is he big
Will he scare me #

302
00:26:47,304 --> 00:26:50,034
# If I ask to leave #

303
00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:53,076
# Will the Wiz even hear me #

304
00:26:53,143 --> 00:26:57,671
# How will I know then #

305
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:04,084
# If I'll ever get home again #

306
00:27:07,758 --> 00:27:12,695
# Here I am alone
though it feels the same #

307
00:27:12,763 --> 00:27:18,326
# I don't know where I'm goin' #

308
00:27:19,603 --> 00:27:24,472
# I'm here on my own
and it's not a game #

309
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:28,170
# And a strange #

310
00:27:28,245 --> 00:27:31,976
# Wind is blowin' #

311
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:37,885
# I'm so amazed at the things
that I see here #

312
00:27:37,955 --> 00:27:43,860
# Don't wanna be afraid
I just don't wanna be here #

313
00:27:43,927 --> 00:27:48,694
# In my mind this is clear #

314
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,431
# What am I doin' #

315
00:27:53,504 --> 00:27:57,304
# Here #

316
00:27:59,476 --> 00:28:02,468
# I wish #

317
00:28:02,546 --> 00:28:07,176
# I was home #

318
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,980
# I wish, I wish #

319
00:28:13,057 --> 00:28:16,254
# I wish I was ##

320
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:32,606
Wait! Mister, please wait!

321
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:57,424
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Succulent and divine!

322
00:28:57,501 --> 00:29:01,403
- Delicious and nutritious.
- Brother crows, this is good stuff!

323
00:29:01,472 --> 00:29:05,499
I'm glad you fellows
are enjoying your breakfast.

324
00:29:05,576 --> 00:29:08,704
Is today the day you're gonna
help me get down from here?

325
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:10,872
Help you down?

326
00:29:10,948 --> 00:29:15,248
What is goin' down in
that hayloft you call a head?

327
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:18,618
Didn't we tell you yesterday
and the day before that...

328
00:29:18,689 --> 00:29:22,455
- And the day before that...
- That you can't get down?

329
00:29:22,526 --> 00:29:25,586
This is your life,
buddy, all hung up!

330
00:29:25,662 --> 00:29:27,926
Besides, Clyde...

331
00:29:27,998 --> 00:29:30,796
...us crows are just thinkin' of you.

332
00:29:30,868 --> 00:29:32,927
There ain't nothin'
to get down for!

333
00:29:33,003 --> 00:29:36,439
But I was
just thinkin', just once, fellas...

334
00:29:36,507 --> 00:29:40,341
...for a little while to walk in my garden,
wouldn't that be terrific?

335
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:43,140
- Walk!
- You can't walk!

336
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:45,443
Why, you just
a straw paper dummy!

337
00:29:45,516 --> 00:29:49,714
You're right, fellas.
I was just bein' selfish.

338
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:52,312
And stupid as usual!

339
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:55,984
- But I was readin' this morning that most people...
- Oh, man!

340
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:59,825
Look, didn't we tell you
readin' was a waste of time?

341
00:29:59,897 --> 00:30:03,663
- But Bacon here said...
- Bacon? Once over lightly, please!

342
00:30:03,734 --> 00:30:07,033
"Knowledge is power. "

343
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,334
- See, and, uh, Cicero, he said...
- Cicero-ro-row!

344
00:30:09,406 --> 00:30:11,874
"More men are ennobled
by study than by nature. "

345
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:21,649
And over here, especially
apropos in my situation...

346
00:30:21,718 --> 00:30:25,017
...i. E., stuck up on this here pole:

347
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:29,024
"Do not accept any situation.
Question, argue and explore. "

348
00:30:29,092 --> 00:30:31,856
Now who you gonna believe?

349
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:36,389
- Mr. Nobody on that paper?
- Fellas, please!

350
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:39,435
Or your good friends, the crows?

351
00:30:39,503 --> 00:30:43,337
Yeah, who have dedicated
their lives to educatin' you.

352
00:30:43,407 --> 00:30:46,774
- Yeah!
- Sounds to me, fellas...

353
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:51,042
...like ol' garbage guts here done forgot
the crow commandments again.

354
00:30:51,114 --> 00:30:54,845
Fellas, I did not forget
the crow commandments. Please!

355
00:30:54,918 --> 00:30:57,113
Run 'em by me!
Run 'em by me.

356
00:30:57,187 --> 00:31:00,520
- Thou shalt honor all crows.
- Right on!

357
00:31:00,591 --> 00:31:04,527
- Proceed!
- Thou shalt stop readin' all bits of paper and literature.

358
00:31:04,595 --> 00:31:08,531
- Trash! Trash!
- And the most important one!

359
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:12,399
Thou shalt never, never get down
off of this here pole!

360
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:15,131
You got it, Clyde!

361
00:31:15,205 --> 00:31:19,471
And the crow anthem!

362
00:31:19,543 --> 00:31:22,034
I gotta sing that thing again?

363
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:24,511
# You gotta libretti it
'til you get it #

364
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:26,606
- # Elucidate #
- # Reiterate #

365
00:31:26,683 --> 00:31:29,174
# And syncopate #

366
00:31:29,253 --> 00:31:33,246
# You can't win
You can't break even #

367
00:31:33,323 --> 00:31:36,724
# And you can't get
outta the game #

368
00:31:36,793 --> 00:31:39,353
# People keep sayin' #

369
00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:42,159
# Things are gonna change
but they look just like #

370
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:44,393
# They're stayin' the same #

371
00:31:44,468 --> 00:31:48,768
# You get in way over your head #

372
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:52,002
# And you only got yourself
to blame #

373
00:31:52,075 --> 00:31:54,839
- # You can't win, child #
- # You can't win, child #

374
00:31:54,912 --> 00:31:57,210
# You can't break even #

375
00:31:57,281 --> 00:32:00,580
# You can't get outta the game #

376
00:32:03,754 --> 00:32:07,952
# You can't win
The world keeps movin' #

377
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:11,392
# And you're standin' far behind #

378
00:32:11,461 --> 00:32:13,929
# People keep sayin' #

379
00:32:13,997 --> 00:32:18,195
- # Things'll get better #
- # Just to ease your state of mind #

380
00:32:18,268 --> 00:32:21,101
# So you lean back #

381
00:32:21,171 --> 00:32:23,298
# And you smoke that smoke #

382
00:32:23,373 --> 00:32:26,035
# And you drink
your glass of wine #

383
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:29,169
# Sayin' you can't win
child #

384
00:32:29,246 --> 00:32:31,339
# You can't break even #

385
00:32:31,415 --> 00:32:35,511
# And you can't get
outta the game #

386
00:32:41,992 --> 00:32:44,017
# You can't win #

387
00:32:44,094 --> 00:32:49,726
# You can't win no way
if your story stays the same #

388
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,200
- # You ain't winnin' #
- # Oh, no #

389
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:57,366
# But I'd like to see you
I'm awfully glad you came #

390
00:32:57,441 --> 00:33:01,377
# Better cool it
'cause it ain't about losin' #

391
00:33:01,445 --> 00:33:04,744
# Then the world
has got no shame #

392
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:07,841
# You can't win, child #

393
00:33:07,918 --> 00:33:13,049
# Can't break even
Can't get outta the game #

394
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:32,337
# You can't win
You can't break even #

395
00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:35,936
# Ain't the way
it's supposed to be #

396
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:39,608
- # You'll be spendin' your little bit of money #
- # Oh, no #

397
00:33:39,683 --> 00:33:43,210
# While someone else
rides for free #

398
00:33:43,286 --> 00:33:45,777
- # Learned your lesson #
- Ooh!

399
00:33:45,856 --> 00:33:50,725
# Refuel your mind before some turkey
blows out your flame #

400
00:33:50,794 --> 00:33:54,924
- # And you can't win, child #
- # No, you can't win #

401
00:33:54,998 --> 00:33:58,559
- # You can't win, child #
- # No, you can't win #

402
00:33:58,635 --> 00:34:02,731
- # You can't win, child #
- # No, you can't win #

403
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:06,242
- # You can't win, child #
- # No, you can't win #

404
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:10,643
# You can't win, child
Can't break even #

405
00:34:10,714 --> 00:34:15,242
# And you can't get
outta the game #

406
00:34:15,318 --> 00:34:20,779
# You can't get outta the game #

407
00:34:20,857 --> 00:34:25,089
# You can't get out #

408
00:34:25,162 --> 00:34:27,153
Ooh!

409
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,859
# Of the game #

410
00:34:30,934 --> 00:34:34,097
# No, no, no ##

411
00:34:37,207 --> 00:34:39,835
- I'll, I'll help you down.
- What?

412
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:43,277
You will?

413
00:34:43,346 --> 00:34:45,405
What's she doing here?

414
00:34:45,482 --> 00:34:50,010
- Get her outta here.
- Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

415
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:52,783
Shoo, shoo,
go on about your business.

416
00:34:52,856 --> 00:34:55,586
Shoo!

417
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:57,559
Ooh!

418
00:34:58,962 --> 00:35:03,058
- Just hold on.
- This is just an experiment.

419
00:35:15,145 --> 00:35:17,113
The results of
the first experiment:

420
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:22,311
Subject is a hopeless failure.

421
00:35:22,385 --> 00:35:24,649
- You are not.
- I am.

422
00:35:24,721 --> 00:35:28,316
You're just a product
of some negative thinking.

423
00:35:28,391 --> 00:35:31,155
First thing we have to do
is get rid of these crows.

424
00:35:31,227 --> 00:35:34,663
Come on, Toto, sic 'em!
Shoo! Shoo!

425
00:35:34,731 --> 00:35:36,824
Shoo! Before I call
the taxidermist, you turkeys!

426
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,925
Get off me, dog!

427
00:35:39,002 --> 00:35:42,699
Good boy, Toto.

428
00:35:45,442 --> 00:35:47,672
We can go now.

429
00:35:49,446 --> 00:35:52,313
You okay?
Come on! Hey!

430
00:35:56,953 --> 00:35:59,421
Ooh!

431
00:36:00,557 --> 00:36:02,923
I think I'm gonna
make it this time.

432
00:36:02,993 --> 00:36:05,928
You sure are.

433
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:09,022
Just a little self-confidence...

434
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:11,397
...and coordination.

435
00:36:11,468 --> 00:36:13,959
You're gonna be fine.

436
00:36:15,872 --> 00:36:19,069
You mean, all this time
the only thing standing between...

437
00:36:19,142 --> 00:36:22,009
...hangin' up there
and livin' it up down here...

438
00:36:22,078 --> 00:36:25,639
were those crows?

439
00:36:25,715 --> 00:36:29,981
Well, they told you you couldn't do it
and you believed them.

440
00:36:30,053 --> 00:36:34,820
If I only had a brain, I would have
figured that out a long time ago.

441
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:38,054
There you go with that
negative thinkin' again.

442
00:36:38,128 --> 00:36:41,723
- Everybody has a brain.
- Uh-uh.

443
00:36:41,798 --> 00:36:44,528
Not me, look.

444
00:36:46,736 --> 00:36:48,761
Oh.

445
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:52,037
Garbage?

446
00:36:53,643 --> 00:36:57,977
"Lgnorance is the night
of the mind...

447
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:02,417
...a night without moon or star. "

448
00:37:02,485 --> 00:37:04,919
Confucius said that.

449
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,292
I'm on my way to find the Wiz.

450
00:37:13,363 --> 00:37:16,230
He's gonna get me back home.

451
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:18,824
That's nice. Thank you.

452
00:37:18,902 --> 00:37:21,598
Good luck.

453
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:28,468
I thought maybe he
could get you a brain.

454
00:37:28,545 --> 00:37:32,106
You think that he could...

455
00:37:32,182 --> 00:37:34,912
And Toto and me,
we could sure use some company.

456
00:37:34,984 --> 00:37:37,452
Besides, you have nothin' to lose.

457
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,080
I don't, do I?
That was so smart of you!

458
00:37:40,156 --> 00:37:43,023
I wish I thought of that.

459
00:37:43,093 --> 00:37:46,790
Indications are it would be
very advantageous for me to join you.

460
00:37:46,863 --> 00:37:49,423
Good.

461
00:37:49,499 --> 00:37:53,196
Um, we only have one problem.

462
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:56,898
The Munchkins said to follow the Yellow Brick
Road, but I haven't been able to find it.

463
00:37:56,973 --> 00:37:59,498
- Yellow Brick Road?
- There it is!

464
00:38:03,213 --> 00:38:05,545
Hey, wait! Wait!

465
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,209
Did you say, "Yellow Brick Road"?

466
00:38:09,285 --> 00:38:13,654
- Yes!
- Look over here!

467
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:20,555
We don't need no cabs.

468
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,895
- Say, what's your name?
- My name is... Dorothy.

469
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:28,802
Dorothy and Toto?
What intelligent names!

470
00:38:30,907 --> 00:38:34,365
Okay, Dorothy and Toto, we're gonna have
to find our own Yellow Brick Road.

471
00:38:36,412 --> 00:38:41,076
# Ease on down
Ease on dow... #

472
00:38:41,151 --> 00:38:45,554
- Down the road!
- There it is!

473
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:48,420
# Ease on down #

474
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:51,654
- Oh!
- # Ease on... Down #

475
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:54,094
- Down the road!
- Oh!

476
00:39:00,703 --> 00:39:02,967
# Don't you carry nothin' #

477
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:06,634
- # That might be a load #
- There it is!

478
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:09,644
Dorothy! Look! Dorothy!

479
00:39:12,048 --> 00:39:14,414
Aaah!

480
00:39:15,852 --> 00:39:18,082
Ta-da!

481
00:39:18,154 --> 00:39:21,419
Whoo! Come on, Dorothy!
Come on!

482
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:23,618
Whoo!

483
00:39:25,695 --> 00:39:30,257
# Come on and ease on down
ease on down the road #

484
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:34,235
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down the road #

485
00:39:34,304 --> 00:39:38,172
# Don't you carry nothin'
that might be a load #

486
00:39:38,241 --> 00:39:41,972
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down the road #

487
00:39:42,045 --> 00:39:46,482
# Pick your left foot up
put your right one down #

488
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:48,540
# Come on, legs
keep movin' #

489
00:39:48,618 --> 00:39:50,552
# Don't you lose no ground #

490
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:54,283
# Just you keep on keepin'
on the road you choose #

491
00:39:54,357 --> 00:39:58,589
# Don't you give up on walkin'
'cause you gave up shoes #

492
00:39:58,661 --> 00:40:01,960
# Ease on down
Ease on down the road #

493
00:40:02,031 --> 00:40:06,832
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down the road #

494
00:40:06,903 --> 00:40:10,999
# Don't you carry nothin'
that might be a load #

495
00:40:11,074 --> 00:40:14,237
# Come on, ease on down
down, down #

496
00:40:15,945 --> 00:40:18,436
Whoo!

497
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,618
Whoo!

498
00:40:35,531 --> 00:40:39,558
# Don't you carry nothin'
that might be a load #

499
00:40:39,636 --> 00:40:42,605
# Ease on down, ease on down
down the road #

500
00:40:42,672 --> 00:40:48,338
# Ease on down, ease on down
down the road #

501
00:40:48,411 --> 00:40:51,972
# Ease on down, ease on down
down the road #

502
00:40:52,048 --> 00:40:56,417
# Ease on down the road #

503
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:03,550
# Ease on down
ease on down the road #

504
00:41:03,626 --> 00:41:08,393
# Ease on down
ease on down the road #

505
00:41:18,141 --> 00:41:21,201
# Ease on down
Ease on down #

506
00:41:21,277 --> 00:41:24,075
Toto!

507
00:41:24,147 --> 00:41:27,116
# Ease on down
ease, ease on down #

508
00:41:27,183 --> 00:41:29,708
- # Down the road ##
- Help!

509
00:41:29,786 --> 00:41:33,483
Help!

510
00:41:33,556 --> 00:41:35,786
Help?

511
00:41:35,858 --> 00:41:38,258
Help? Where?

512
00:41:38,328 --> 00:41:41,161
Help! Help!

513
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:44,666
Over here!

514
00:41:44,734 --> 00:41:47,259
Help!

515
00:41:47,337 --> 00:41:51,034
Hurry! Hurry!

516
00:41:51,107 --> 00:41:54,201
- Where are you?
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!

517
00:41:54,277 --> 00:41:57,405
Step right up and save a life!

518
00:42:02,085 --> 00:42:06,784
Ooh! Ooh!

519
00:42:10,793 --> 00:42:14,422
I'm in a little bit of a squeeze,
brother. Can you give me a hand?

520
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:18,160
Dorothy?

521
00:42:27,043 --> 00:42:30,604
Oh, how terrible.

522
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,276
- Don't move.
- Don't worry, I wasn't planning any promenades.

523
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:38,548
We'll be right back.

524
00:42:43,192 --> 00:42:45,786
Oh, he's so brave.

525
00:42:45,862 --> 00:42:47,955
He's probably in shock.

526
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:52,400
Oh, what I wouldn't
give to be in shock... Just once.

527
00:42:55,905 --> 00:42:58,066
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

528
00:42:58,141 --> 00:43:03,545
No apology necessary. I told you
nothing hurts me. I have no feelings.

529
00:43:05,214 --> 00:43:08,877
The genius who created me only
took care of my dashing good looks...

530
00:43:08,951 --> 00:43:14,412
...my razor sharp wit and my irresistible
attraction to the wrong women.

531
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:17,391
What he forgot to add...

532
00:43:19,762 --> 00:43:22,629
was a heart.

533
00:43:22,698 --> 00:43:25,826
But... Everyone has a heart.

534
00:43:25,902 --> 00:43:30,464
Alas, everyone but yours truly.

535
00:43:32,408 --> 00:43:35,036
Hello!

536
00:43:35,111 --> 00:43:39,070
Nobody home in Soulville.

537
00:43:48,591 --> 00:43:52,962
Rid of you!
Free from your posterior prison!

538
00:43:53,095 --> 00:43:55,791
You hulking she devil!

539
00:43:55,864 --> 00:44:00,198
Don't hear ya laughing now.

540
00:44:00,269 --> 00:44:04,501
We were abandoned here when
this park went "el foldo. "

541
00:44:04,573 --> 00:44:07,337
Ah, it was a sad day.

542
00:44:07,409 --> 00:44:11,846
There's not much amusement to
the closing down of an amusement park.

543
00:44:11,914 --> 00:44:14,849
But yours truly is an old trooper!

544
00:44:14,917 --> 00:44:19,217
I quickly made plans
for the future.

545
00:44:19,288 --> 00:44:22,985
But alas, I was felled
by my 4th wife, Teenie.

546
00:44:23,058 --> 00:44:25,424
Crushed in my prime!

547
00:44:30,799 --> 00:44:34,064
There, how does that feel?

548
00:44:34,136 --> 00:44:37,936
But that's the whole
tragic point, my friends.

549
00:44:38,007 --> 00:44:42,944
# What would I do #

550
00:44:43,012 --> 00:44:46,175
# If I could suddenly feel #

551
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:51,652
# And to know once again #

552
00:44:52,988 --> 00:44:57,448
# That what I feel is real #

553
00:44:57,526 --> 00:45:01,189
# I could cry
I could smile #

554
00:45:03,132 --> 00:45:06,795
# I might lay back
for a while #

555
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:09,133
- # Tell me what #
- # What #

556
00:45:09,204 --> 00:45:11,968
# What would I do #

557
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:15,977
# If I could feel #

558
00:45:19,181 --> 00:45:22,514
# What would I do #

559
00:45:22,584 --> 00:45:26,987
# If I could
reach inside of me #

560
00:45:28,757 --> 00:45:31,783
# And to know
how it feels to say #

561
00:45:34,363 --> 00:45:36,331
# I like what I see #

562
00:45:36,398 --> 00:45:40,596
# And I'd be more #

563
00:45:40,669 --> 00:45:43,638
# Than glad to share #

564
00:45:43,705 --> 00:45:47,698
# All that I have
inside of here #

565
00:45:47,776 --> 00:45:52,713
# And the songs
my heart might bring #

566
00:45:52,781 --> 00:45:57,343
# You'd be more
than glad to sing #

567
00:45:59,388 --> 00:46:03,791
# And if tears should
fall from my eyes #

568
00:46:03,859 --> 00:46:08,319
# Just think of all the wounds
they could mend #

569
00:46:08,397 --> 00:46:13,198
# And just think of all the time
I could spend #

570
00:46:13,268 --> 00:46:16,601
# Just being vulnerable again #

571
00:46:16,672 --> 00:46:19,038
- # Tell me what #
- # What #

572
00:46:19,108 --> 00:46:21,872
# What would I do #

573
00:46:21,944 --> 00:46:26,643
- # Oh, tell me what #
- # What, what would I do #

574
00:46:26,715 --> 00:46:29,309
- # Oh, tell me what #
- # What #

575
00:46:29,384 --> 00:46:33,286
# What would I do #

576
00:46:33,355 --> 00:46:39,225
# If I could feel ##

577
00:46:40,362 --> 00:46:43,820
I'm just a miserable
hunk of junk.

578
00:46:43,899 --> 00:46:45,958
Me!

579
00:46:46,034 --> 00:46:49,003
Once the fastest
metal mouth on the midway.

580
00:46:49,071 --> 00:46:54,634
Frozen... ironically in a position
I had assumed all too often.

581
00:46:56,211 --> 00:47:00,671
A seat cushion for Teenie!

582
00:47:00,749 --> 00:47:02,979
Teenie!

583
00:47:03,051 --> 00:47:05,349
Teenie!

584
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,819
- Teenie!
- Dorothy!

585
00:47:06,889 --> 00:47:10,325
- Teenie! Teenie!
- Are you thinkin' what I am?

586
00:47:10,392 --> 00:47:12,087
- Teenie!
- You're so smart!

587
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:15,426
Teenie! Teen...

588
00:47:15,497 --> 00:47:17,727
You could come with us
to see the Wiz.

589
00:47:18,967 --> 00:47:21,333
He's gonna get me back home...

590
00:47:21,403 --> 00:47:23,894
...and he's gonna get
the Scarecrow some brains.

591
00:47:23,972 --> 00:47:26,099
Maybe he could get you a heart.

592
00:47:26,175 --> 00:47:30,077
You're not just flimflammin'
an ol' flimflammer, are ya?

593
00:47:30,145 --> 00:47:32,306
Could I come with ya?

594
00:47:32,381 --> 00:47:35,077
- Of course.
- "A threefold cord is not quickly broken. "

595
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:40,349
What's wrong?

596
00:47:40,422 --> 00:47:42,253
He rusted himself cryin'.

597
00:47:42,324 --> 00:47:46,454
Oil! Oil!

598
00:47:46,528 --> 00:47:48,928
- What?
- Oil!

599
00:47:48,997 --> 00:47:52,558
- Find some oil!
- Some oil!

600
00:47:52,634 --> 00:47:54,602
Oil!

601
00:47:58,273 --> 00:48:02,004
# Slide some oil to me #

602
00:48:02,077 --> 00:48:06,446
# Let it trickle down my spine #

603
00:48:07,516 --> 00:48:09,677
# If you don't have STP #

604
00:48:09,751 --> 00:48:13,812
# Crisco will do just fine #

605
00:48:13,889 --> 00:48:17,154
# Slide some to my elbow #

606
00:48:17,226 --> 00:48:21,253
# And to my fingers
if you would #

607
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:25,027
# Slide some oil
to me, girl #

608
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:29,696
# Whoo, don't that
feel good #

609
00:48:29,771 --> 00:48:33,263
# Slide some oil
to my feet #

610
00:48:33,342 --> 00:48:36,175
# Look-a there
I got toes again #

611
00:48:36,245 --> 00:48:38,975
# Come on
slide some oil to my knees #

612
00:48:40,515 --> 00:48:44,178
# And let me see
if I can bend #

613
00:48:44,253 --> 00:48:47,916
# Slide some oil to me #

614
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:51,790
# I'm beginnin' to feel just fine #

615
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:55,193
# Slide some oil
down my throat #

616
00:48:55,264 --> 00:49:00,395
# And let me lubricate my mind #

617
00:49:00,469 --> 00:49:03,097
# Slide some oil to me #

618
00:49:03,171 --> 00:49:07,232
# Go ahead
hit my shoulder blades #

619
00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:11,006
# Those who don't have
to lubricate #

620
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:15,175
# Sure got it made #

621
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:19,414
# Slide some oil to me #

622
00:49:19,488 --> 00:49:21,752
# Let it slip down my side.

623
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:26,851
# Laying there in one position #

624
00:49:26,928 --> 00:49:30,728
# Sure done made me tired #
Now watch me dance.

625
00:49:40,709 --> 00:49:44,805
Come on, you metal metatarsals,
don't fail me now.

626
00:49:47,082 --> 00:49:50,483
Ah-ha! Fall in line
and get left behind.

627
00:50:12,007 --> 00:50:14,237
Two bits!

628
00:50:23,919 --> 00:50:27,912
Let me show you my
Saturday night finish!

629
00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:32,517
Oh! Music man!
Let me hear that band!

630
00:50:33,762 --> 00:50:35,923
# Don't turn the water on me #

631
00:50:35,997 --> 00:50:39,364
# Just let me burn
and let me lubricate #

632
00:50:39,434 --> 00:50:43,672
# My mind ##

633
00:51:06,961 --> 00:51:08,656
Come on!

634
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:11,756
# There may be times you think
you've lost your mind #

635
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:15,792
# These steps you're takin'
leave you steps behind #

636
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:19,362
# The road you're walkin'
might be long sometimes #

637
00:51:19,441 --> 00:51:23,741
# But you keep on steppin'
and you'll be just fine #

638
00:51:23,812 --> 00:51:27,077
# Ease on down
ease on down the road #

639
00:51:27,148 --> 00:51:31,346
# Come on and ease on down
ease on down the road #

640
00:51:31,419 --> 00:51:35,355
# Don't you carry nothin'
that might be a load #

641
00:51:35,423 --> 00:51:38,950
# Come on, ease on down
down the road #

642
00:51:39,027 --> 00:51:42,963
# Come on, ease on down
down the road #

643
00:51:43,031 --> 00:51:46,125
# Ease on down
ease on down the road #

644
00:51:46,201 --> 00:51:48,192
# Ease on down
ease on down ##

645
00:51:48,269 --> 00:51:50,760
Hey! Look at me walkin'!

646
00:51:55,510 --> 00:52:00,470
- Stop the music!
- What's the matter? You need more oil?

647
00:52:00,548 --> 00:52:04,143
No! That beast!

648
00:52:07,188 --> 00:52:10,214
He's checkin' us out.

649
00:52:10,291 --> 00:52:14,318
Oh, it's just a statue.

650
00:52:17,866 --> 00:52:20,596
Made of stone, see?

651
00:52:23,104 --> 00:52:27,598
Now even a dummy like me
knows a stone lion...

652
00:52:30,678 --> 00:52:33,511
...can't... Check you out.

653
00:52:53,635 --> 00:52:56,866
# Say what you wanna
but I'm here to stay #

654
00:52:56,938 --> 00:53:00,704
# 'Cause I'm a mean ol' lion #

655
00:53:00,775 --> 00:53:02,800
# Now you can go
where you're gonna #

656
00:53:02,877 --> 00:53:06,278
# But don't get in my way
I'm a mean ol' lion #

657
00:53:08,716 --> 00:53:12,743
# You'll be standing in a draft #

658
00:53:12,821 --> 00:53:16,951
# If you don't hear me laugh #

659
00:53:17,025 --> 00:53:22,361
Ha-ha!
# If you have to come around #

660
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:25,957
# You best not make me frown #

661
00:53:26,034 --> 00:53:29,629
# Or I just might
knock you down #

662
00:53:29,704 --> 00:53:31,934
# 'Cause I'm a mean ol' lion #

663
00:53:39,113 --> 00:53:42,776
# You know I'm ready to fight
and turn your day into night #

664
00:53:42,851 --> 00:53:47,220
# 'Cause I'm a mean ol' lion #

665
00:53:47,288 --> 00:53:50,883
# If you're half bright
you'll detour to the right #

666
00:53:50,959 --> 00:53:54,520
# From a mean ol' lion #

667
00:53:54,596 --> 00:53:57,565
# And all you strangers
got to beware #

668
00:53:57,632 --> 00:54:03,468
# This is the king
of the jungle here #

669
00:54:03,538 --> 00:54:08,202
# And if I happen
to let you slide #

670
00:54:08,276 --> 00:54:10,801
# Don't stand there
run and hide #

671
00:54:10,879 --> 00:54:14,872
# You just, you just
caught my better side #

672
00:54:14,949 --> 00:54:18,441
# Now I'm a mean ol' lion #

673
00:54:20,488 --> 00:54:25,187
# Look, you better beware #

674
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:29,856
# This is the, the king
of the jungle here #

675
00:54:31,165 --> 00:54:35,261
# And if I happen
to let you slide #

676
00:54:35,336 --> 00:54:39,033
# Don't stand there
run and hide #

677
00:54:39,107 --> 00:54:42,702
# You just done caught
my better side #

678
00:54:42,777 --> 00:54:46,076
# Now I'm a mean ol' lion #

679
00:54:47,515 --> 00:54:49,176
Toto!

680
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:56,952
# Now I'm a mean ol' lion ##

681
00:55:01,229 --> 00:55:03,424
How dare you touch...

682
00:55:03,498 --> 00:55:08,094
...the personage of a king?

683
00:55:08,169 --> 00:55:12,868
You tacky package of horse fodder.

684
00:55:12,941 --> 00:55:17,173
Begone, you overexcited slot machine.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

685
00:55:18,947 --> 00:55:20,972
Oh! You mangy mutt! Oh!

686
00:55:21,049 --> 00:55:22,880
Toto!

687
00:55:22,951 --> 00:55:27,388
Oh!

688
00:55:27,455 --> 00:55:29,889
He bit my paw!

689
00:55:39,133 --> 00:55:41,397
King of the jungle?

690
00:55:41,469 --> 00:55:46,372
- King of the cowards.
- You oughta be ashamed of yourself, scaring us like that.

691
00:55:46,441 --> 00:55:48,705
You big scaredy-cat!

692
00:55:48,776 --> 00:55:52,542
I can't scare anything.
I can't even scare a scarecrow...

693
00:55:52,613 --> 00:55:56,515
...a tin man or
a little puppy, anything.

694
00:55:56,584 --> 00:56:00,543
It's no wonder they drummed me
out of the jungle.

695
00:56:00,621 --> 00:56:04,853
- I.O.B.K.!
- I.O.B.K.?

696
00:56:04,926 --> 00:56:09,226
Incapable Of Being King!

697
00:56:09,297 --> 00:56:12,289
No! Wait, wait! Wait!

698
00:56:12,367 --> 00:56:15,393
I was exiled in disgrace.

699
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:18,234
I thought I'd be safe here.

700
00:56:18,306 --> 00:56:21,935
No one would...
discover my terrible secret.

701
00:56:29,017 --> 00:56:33,477
Uh, that I'm...

702
00:56:40,028 --> 00:56:43,725
...a lion without any courage!

703
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:58,304
"Uneasy lies the head...

704
00:56:58,379 --> 00:57:02,645
...that wears a crown. "
W. Shakespeare.

705
00:57:05,753 --> 00:57:10,622
Well, I thought
I'd seen 'em all.

706
00:57:10,691 --> 00:57:16,095
But never, never have I seen...

707
00:57:17,465 --> 00:57:22,334
...a lion... without courage.

708
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:32,172
Lion!

709
00:57:34,682 --> 00:57:39,051
Lion!

710
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,816
Maybe the Wiz could give you
some courage.

711
00:57:41,889 --> 00:57:44,687
- It's a good idea.
- Capital suggestion.

712
00:57:44,759 --> 00:57:49,059
- Capital! He's gonna get me a heart.
- And me some brains.

713
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:51,724
Come with us to Emerald City.

714
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:57,599
I'd love to, but I can't.

715
00:57:57,672 --> 00:58:01,039
But why?

716
00:58:06,214 --> 00:58:08,682
Because... I'm scared!

717
00:58:08,749 --> 00:58:12,754
Oh.

718
00:58:13,955 --> 00:58:16,446
# Oh, there #

719
00:58:16,524 --> 00:58:21,757
# May be times #

720
00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:29,133
# When you wish
you wasn't born #

721
00:58:29,203 --> 00:58:33,230
# And you wake one morning
to find your courage gone #

722
00:58:33,307 --> 00:58:36,799
# But just know that feelin'
only lasts a little while #

723
00:58:36,878 --> 00:58:41,679
# You just stick with us
We'll show you how to smile #

724
00:58:41,749 --> 00:58:45,150
# Ease on down
ease on down the road #

725
00:58:45,219 --> 00:58:48,950
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down the road #

726
00:58:49,023 --> 00:58:53,153
# Don't you carry nothin'
that might be a load #

727
00:58:53,227 --> 00:58:57,288
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down, down the road #

728
00:58:57,365 --> 00:59:01,825
# Ease on down
ease on down the road #

729
00:59:01,903 --> 00:59:05,270
# Ease on down
ease on down the road #

730
00:59:05,339 --> 00:59:09,298
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down the road #

731
00:59:09,377 --> 00:59:13,370
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down the road #

732
00:59:13,447 --> 00:59:17,543
# Come on, ease on down
ease on down the road #

733
00:59:17,618 --> 00:59:21,452
# Ease on down
ease on down the road #

734
00:59:21,522 --> 00:59:24,889
# I gotta get down
gotta get, gotta, gotta #

735
00:59:24,959 --> 00:59:28,451
# Gotta, gotta, gotta
getta, getta, getta #

736
00:59:28,529 --> 00:59:32,898
# Ease on down the road
ease on down the road ##

737
00:59:42,777 --> 00:59:47,578
Ah, my ma would be so proud.

738
00:59:47,648 --> 00:59:51,812
Going to see the Wiz!

739
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:59,826
My mama used to
always say to me, Fleet!

740
00:59:59,894 --> 01:00:02,124
Fleet?

741
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:09,497
That's my name,
Fleetwood Coup de Ville.

742
01:00:12,406 --> 01:00:14,704
- Mama had high ideals.
- Yeah!

743
01:00:14,775 --> 01:00:16,766
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah!

744
01:00:30,491 --> 01:00:34,052
I ain't too happy
underground, you all.

745
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:42,768
- How does he do that?
- It's just a hoax, my friend.

746
01:00:42,837 --> 01:00:45,465
He's got a little motor
in his... Pocket.

747
01:01:24,178 --> 01:01:27,170
- Lion! Lion!
- Help!

748
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:33,347
- Oh, my... Please, somebody!
- Shh!

749
01:01:40,027 --> 01:01:43,963
Lion! Lion!

750
01:02:17,198 --> 01:02:21,066
Owww! Lion!

751
01:02:23,337 --> 01:02:26,670
Li...

752
01:02:26,741 --> 01:02:29,107
Lion!

753
01:02:35,816 --> 01:02:38,080
Aaah!

754
01:03:50,491 --> 01:03:53,790
Lion, save me!

755
01:03:59,567 --> 01:04:02,434
Dorothy!

756
01:04:13,881 --> 01:04:18,113
Toto! Toto, Toto, Toto.

757
01:04:21,789 --> 01:04:23,950
Hey!

758
01:04:24,024 --> 01:04:27,687
Oh! Wait!

759
01:04:27,761 --> 01:04:31,026
- Where's the lion?
- I'm coming!

760
01:04:31,098 --> 01:04:34,226
- Wait, wait!
- Lion!

761
01:04:34,301 --> 01:04:36,735
Come on! Let's go!

762
01:04:36,804 --> 01:04:40,706
- Hurry up!
- This way, this way! Wait for me!

763
01:05:15,176 --> 01:05:17,269
Hey!

764
01:05:25,452 --> 01:05:28,546
Sssss!

765
01:05:33,527 --> 01:05:36,758
# Ease on down
ease on down the road #

766
01:05:36,830 --> 01:05:39,025
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

767
01:05:39,099 --> 01:05:43,695
My queen, if you'll allow me,
like I say...

768
01:05:43,771 --> 01:05:48,105
...you stick with the big kitty
and you'll be in heaven.

769
01:05:49,143 --> 01:05:53,239
Sssss!

770
01:05:54,949 --> 01:05:59,511
Outta the frying pan, into the...
This is like a setup.

771
01:06:01,322 --> 01:06:03,190
Stay away! Dorothy! Lion!

772
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:06,786
Stay away! Dorothy! Lion!

773
01:06:06,861 --> 01:06:09,523
Don't follow them! Don't!

774
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:11,930
Oh, please! It's a setup!

775
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,959
- Stop!
- Come back!

776
01:06:16,037 --> 01:06:19,973
Jump! Don't go in there!

777
01:06:23,178 --> 01:06:25,271
Whoo, whoo!

778
01:06:38,026 --> 01:06:42,929
Oh! Dorothy! Lion!

779
01:06:42,998 --> 01:06:46,092
- I can't move him! I can't move him!
- Dorothy?

780
01:06:46,167 --> 01:06:49,034
- Get Toto, we'll come back for him.
- Toto!

781
01:06:49,104 --> 01:06:52,835
Oh, look, poor little Toto!

782
01:06:52,907 --> 01:06:56,104
Sweet little Toto.
What are we going to do?

783
01:06:56,177 --> 01:06:59,772
- All is lost!
- Dorothy!

784
01:06:59,848 --> 01:07:02,510
Dorothy, please.

785
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:09,622
Oh, please, don't be dead.
Oh, please, don't be dead.

786
01:07:09,691 --> 01:07:14,321
Oh, all is lost.

787
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:25,572
# How high the moon #

788
01:07:27,742 --> 01:07:29,710
What's happenin', babe?

789
01:07:29,778 --> 01:07:34,112
Hey, Lion's okay!

790
01:07:34,182 --> 01:07:37,379
- Hey, baby!
- Come and cry over here!

791
01:07:37,452 --> 01:07:42,685
- Teenie! Think of Teenie!
- Dor... Dorothy?

792
01:07:42,757 --> 01:07:46,989
- Think of Teenie!
- Uh, Teenie, uh, Teenie!

793
01:07:47,062 --> 01:07:51,590
- Uh, Teenie!
- It's all my fault!

794
01:07:51,666 --> 01:07:56,000
Uh, Teenie! Uh, Teenie!

795
01:07:56,071 --> 01:07:59,006
Oh, mighty Zeus!

796
01:07:59,074 --> 01:08:01,440
And gods of the universe!

797
01:08:01,509 --> 01:08:06,708
Why have you cursed
this low, mangy animal so?

798
01:08:06,781 --> 01:08:10,842
Once I was a king,
a lion amongst lions!

799
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:16,784
Ruler of a beautiful
kingdom by a waterfall.

800
01:08:17,859 --> 01:08:21,795
Attended by butterflies
and sparrows.

801
01:08:21,863 --> 01:08:25,959
And now banished for lack of courage...

802
01:08:26,034 --> 01:08:29,197
I cannot even protect these
friends who have been so kind.

803
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:32,262
Oh, I was strong and brave...

804
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:35,867
...in the subway only to be
foolish and weak again.

805
01:08:35,944 --> 01:08:38,174
I led us into
the very jaws of death!

806
01:08:41,349 --> 01:08:44,284
Oh, let me end it all!

807
01:08:44,352 --> 01:08:48,220
- Lion, Lion!
- No!

808
01:08:48,289 --> 01:08:51,417
No, let me splatter
to the four winds!

809
01:08:51,493 --> 01:08:54,087
It's all right, Lion.
It's all right.

810
01:08:54,162 --> 01:08:56,153
Everything's all right.

811
01:08:56,231 --> 01:08:59,723
- The worst is over, my furry friend.
- No!

812
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:03,498
Would you lay an appropriate quote
on this poor beasty brother?

813
01:09:07,809 --> 01:09:11,745
"Showers expected late tomorrow. "

814
01:09:11,913 --> 01:09:14,279
Lion?

815
01:09:24,993 --> 01:09:28,019
# There is a place #

816
01:09:28,096 --> 01:09:31,361
# We'll go #

817
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:36,735
# Where there is mostly quiet #

818
01:09:38,306 --> 01:09:44,040
# Flowers and butterflies #

819
01:09:45,146 --> 01:09:52,951
# A rainbow lives beside it #

820
01:09:57,225 --> 01:10:02,993
# And from a velvet sky #

821
01:10:03,064 --> 01:10:09,526
# The summer storm #

822
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:14,408
# You can feel #

823
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:18,207
# The coolness in the air #

824
01:10:21,049 --> 01:10:24,143
# But you're still #

825
01:10:24,219 --> 01:10:28,849
# Warm #

826
01:10:32,694 --> 01:10:37,427
# And then a mighty roar #

827
01:10:39,133 --> 01:10:43,467
# Will start the sky #

828
01:10:43,538 --> 01:10:47,668
# To cryin' #

829
01:10:50,411 --> 01:10:55,314
# But not even lightning #

830
01:10:55,383 --> 01:10:59,877
# Will be frightening #

831
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:06,426
# My lion #

832
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:13,934
# And with no fear inside #

833
01:11:15,069 --> 01:11:19,130
# No need to run #

834
01:11:19,207 --> 01:11:23,974
# No need to hide #

835
01:11:24,045 --> 01:11:28,141
# You're standing strong #

836
01:11:28,216 --> 01:11:32,050
# And tall #

837
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:35,954
# You're the bravest #

838
01:11:36,024 --> 01:11:40,484
# Of them all #

839
01:11:41,663 --> 01:11:46,032
# If on courage #

840
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,625
# You must call #

841
01:11:48,703 --> 01:11:52,799
# Then just keep on tryin' #

842
01:11:52,874 --> 01:11:55,638
# And tryin' #

843
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:59,771
# And tryin' #

844
01:11:59,847 --> 01:12:04,511
# You're a lion #

845
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:07,680
# In your own way #

846
01:12:07,755 --> 01:12:12,317
# Be a lion #

847
01:12:14,195 --> 01:12:16,686
Come on, be a lion.

848
01:12:18,266 --> 01:12:23,135
# I'm standing strong #

849
01:12:23,204 --> 01:12:25,263
# And tall #

850
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:30,039
# You're the bravest #

851
01:12:30,111 --> 01:12:35,208
# Of them all #

852
01:12:35,283 --> 01:12:40,220
# If on courage #

853
01:12:40,288 --> 01:12:43,815
# You must call #

854
01:12:43,891 --> 01:12:47,383
# Keep on tryin' #

855
01:12:47,462 --> 01:12:49,896
# And tryin' #

856
01:12:49,964 --> 01:12:54,060
# And tryin' #

857
01:12:54,135 --> 01:12:57,866
# I'm a lion #

858
01:12:57,939 --> 01:13:01,272
# In my own way #

859
01:13:03,211 --> 01:13:07,170
# I'm a lion #

860
01:13:07,248 --> 01:13:11,514
- # A lion #
- # A lion #

861
01:13:11,586 --> 01:13:17,547
# I'm a lion ##

862
01:14:17,852 --> 01:14:21,288
- How do we get in?
- And how do you do?

863
01:14:21,355 --> 01:14:23,289
- Good evening there, brother.
- This place is nice.

864
01:14:23,357 --> 01:14:25,325
The service entrance
is at the side.

865
01:14:25,393 --> 01:14:28,556
We're here to see the Wiz.

866
01:14:28,629 --> 01:14:31,757
This is where the Wiz lives,
isn't it?

867
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:36,429
May I welcome you to the Emerald City.

868
01:15:19,814 --> 01:15:23,250
# Ahh, ahh, ah #

869
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:30,722
# Ahh, ahh, ah #

870
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:43,430
# I want to be seen green #

871
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:46,668
# Wouldn't be caught dead red #

872
01:15:46,741 --> 01:15:51,144
# 'Cause if you are seen green #

873
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:54,376
# It means you've got mean bread #

874
01:16:02,123 --> 01:16:05,149
# Ahh, ahh, ah #

875
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:14,100
# Ahh, ahh, ah #

876
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:25,774
# You've got to be seen in green
to show that your stuff's laid #

877
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:29,180
- # If you're not seen green #
# You'd better be wearin' jade #

878
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:40,823
# Ahh, ahh, ah #

879
01:16:44,599 --> 01:16:49,298
# You've got to be seen green #

880
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:53,171
# Don't tell him
your cupboard's bare #

881
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:57,075
# That you gave up
one week's feed #

882
01:16:57,145 --> 01:17:01,081
# To pay for your colored hair #
