1
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:30,261
We couldn't see a thing.
As usual.

2
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:45,040
I hurried.
I wanted to see you.

3
00:01:46,653 --> 00:01:47,677
Here.

4
00:01:48,188 --> 00:01:49,985
I picked these for you.

5
00:01:51,324 --> 00:01:52,689
They smell nice.

6
00:01:54,194 --> 00:01:55,456
Camille...

7
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:58,459
You don't look well.
You're ever so pale.

8
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:04,229
Are you eating enough?
Are you sleeping enough?

9
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:08,264
You've been up the hill again.

10
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:11,444
The front...

11
00:02:11,978 --> 00:02:14,071
Do you know how far away it is?

12
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:18,442
Do you really think
you'll see something?

13
00:02:20,454 --> 00:02:22,046
You're all so stupid!

14
00:02:24,825 --> 00:02:28,226
I'm sick
of your sentimental superstitions.

15
00:02:28,728 --> 00:02:30,889
Do they get in that state for you?

16
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:33,499
I bet they're glad without women!

17
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:35,897
- You'll see when...
- When I'm married?

18
00:02:36,336 --> 00:02:40,272
I won't spend my time
waiting for my husband.

19
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:42,341
I'll follow him whatever!

20
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:45,336
Has the postman been?

21
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:53,043
He had nothing for you.

22
00:02:53,587 --> 00:02:55,612
François can't write every day.

23
00:03:00,694 --> 00:03:03,390
He's all you care about anyway.

24
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:08,590
You were different
before you married.

25
00:03:11,638 --> 00:03:12,764
Here!

26
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:19,543
Frankly, you don't deserve it.

27
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:34,856
"Post Code 313.

28
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,888
"May 15, 1917.

29
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:41,364
"Camille, I don't want you
to write back to me.

30
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:43,526
"You'll never see me again.

31
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:46,566
"François."

32
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:17,401
Where are you going?

33
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,835
I'm leaving home.

34
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:30,206
Go home, madam.

35
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:33,811
A woman shouldn't be out alone.

36
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:35,717
I have to go.

37
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:37,914
Don't be a nuisance. Go home!

38
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:38,690
Who are you?

39
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,031
What are you doing here?

40
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:45,501
I was lost.
I spotted you so I came over.

41
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:53,045
Who are you? Where are you from?

42
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:55,670
Verneuil. I've walked a long time.

43
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:59,649
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

44
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:02,352
No whiskers yet.

45
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:07,392
Where are you going?

46
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,649
To fight the war.

47
00:09:09,195 --> 00:09:10,685
You're too young.

48
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,290
Get lost. Don't waste my time.
Go back where you came from.

49
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:50,128
Who goes there?

50
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:55,138
Who goes there?

51
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:39,451
Anyone not on our side
is an enemy.

52
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:42,621
You should have said.

53
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,185
I'm not your enemy, I'm with you.

54
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:49,651
You bloody fool.

55
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:52,822
You could have been killed.

56
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:55,197
No, impossible.

57
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:06,912
No other wounds?
You've examined him?

58
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:07,910
There's no need.

59
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:09,639
Whatever you say.

60
00:11:10,883 --> 00:11:12,783
We'll get rid of him tomorrow.

61
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,683
He won't be better by tomorrow, sir.

62
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:33,238
Go to sleep, lad.

63
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,370
My name's not "lad",
my name's Camille.

64
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:41,212
Pour the batter
on the Montmorency cherries.

65
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:44,373
A real clafoutis
needs Montmorency cherries.

66
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:45,609
At the orphanage...

67
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:48,448
Shut up. You're a thief.

68
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:50,988
Even your rifle
was stolen from a German.

69
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:57,395
When you wake up,

70
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:01,523
the aroma of clafoutis
straight from the oven...

71
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:03,025
is magical.

72
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,837
Got any family?

73
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:09,708
No, nobody.

74
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:11,973
Nobody? Nobody at all?

75
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:13,874
No, I'm alone in the world.

76
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:16,072
Incredible, you're just like me.

77
00:12:16,215 --> 00:12:18,308
I don't have anybody either.

78
00:12:18,918 --> 00:12:20,351
They have family.

79
00:12:20,486 --> 00:12:21,885
Where are you from?

80
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:23,545
None of your business.

81
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:26,123
No one wants to know where I'm from?

82
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:28,250
Antoine, where are you from?

83
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:31,192
"Atlantis, that land beneath the sea

84
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,730
"where giant squid swim gracefully,

85
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:39,594
"where mermaids let down their hair

86
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:41,832
"while waiting for lost sailors,

87
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:44,169
"where the sun's rays nev..."

88
00:12:45,812 --> 00:12:47,006
How does it go?

89
00:12:47,146 --> 00:12:49,478
"...never reach people's eyes,

90
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:51,640
"no more than their heartbeats."

91
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:53,917
What a load of rubbish.

92
00:12:54,053 --> 00:12:55,918
What are you talking about?

93
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:58,819
We don't want to talk anyway,
so shut up.

94
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,788
Talk...

95
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:04,061
Talk...

96
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,268
I'm like you.
I won't make any more efforts.

97
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:13,030
I'm sick of it.

98
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:39,020
Philippe...

99
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:41,590
No.

100
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:46,262
Get up!

101
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:48,964
Philippe!

102
00:14:58,811 --> 00:14:59,800
Lieutenant...

103
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:02,005
It's nearly over.

104
00:15:02,148 --> 00:15:03,945
You'll be able to rest soon.

105
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:07,508
Don't think about it.
It's over now.

106
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:11,346
You're not alone. We're here.

107
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:16,056
What are you staring at?

108
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,523
You've never had a nightmare?

109
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:22,129
Go back to sleep.

110
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:34,277
The lieutenant knows what he's doing.

111
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:37,439
I have the feeling we left from here,

112
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,050
we're here now...

113
00:15:39,185 --> 00:15:41,380
and that we have all this left.

114
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,385
At least.

115
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:46,615
If we left from there,
we're not here now.

116
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,624
I reckon we're here instead.

117
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:50,251
We headed to the left?

118
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:53,228
We made a detour at one point.

119
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:57,262
It's like a tiny forest.

120
00:15:57,403 --> 00:15:58,131
It's funny.

121
00:15:58,271 --> 00:15:59,932
A fir tree...

122
00:16:00,773 --> 00:16:02,206
A birch.

123
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:07,872
We'd need to crawl through it.
Like ants.

124
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:09,276
Like ants...

125
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,645
What's going on?

126
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:17,722
We're meeting La Douce.
We can't miss her.

127
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:19,813
A woman?

128
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:22,723
Yeah, a very beautiful woman,

129
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:24,853
old, cold but that's okay.

130
00:16:25,498 --> 00:16:27,329
Why are you meeting her?

131
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:30,092
You ask a lot of questions.

132
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:31,760
She'll help us.

133
00:16:31,904 --> 00:16:33,064
To do what?

134
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:35,639
To find our way.
Give it a rest now!

135
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:01,522
That's north, that's south.

136
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:03,532
I thought we'd never make it.

137
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:05,933
I expected it to be a lot bigger.

138
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,798
So where's La Douce?

139
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:11,034
In front of you.

140
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:13,008
Old, cold, showing the way.

141
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:15,136
But you stop here, Camille.

142
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:19,546
If you head upstream,
you'll reach a village in an hour.

143
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:21,312
They'll look after you.

144
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:25,317
Which way are you going?

145
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:36,400
I'm coming too.

146
00:17:36,535 --> 00:17:37,559
No.

147
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:08,761
Fetch him.

148
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:50,336
All right...

149
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:53,635
Where were we?

150
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:56,281
Chapter two.

151
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:58,850
Remember what had happened?

152
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:00,315
They were under the sea.

153
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:01,420
That's right.

154
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:04,086
"Atlantis opened her arms to them."

155
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:08,417
I don't get it.
Is Atlantis a woman or a country?

156
00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:13,128
It's a "wonderful land".
We already told you that.

157
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:15,657
"Atlantis opened her arms...

158
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:18,929
"The depths were deep blue,

159
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:21,596
"'so blue, it made your head spin.

160
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,809
"It was cool,
cooler than on land but very mild.

161
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:34,579
"They would never know
bad weather again.

162
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,654
"'This climate didn't...

163
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:42,123
"prevent the fauna and flora
from developing freely.

164
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:45,697
"Even the insects
were of prodigious dimensions."

165
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:48,324
No, that's not the right tone.

166
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:59,374
"They were struck dumb
by this fabulous discovery..."

167
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:12,089
I've seen Atlantis.

168
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,355
You're not dead then?

169
00:20:17,396 --> 00:20:19,296
You've seen Atlantis?

170
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:24,626
Yes, it was beautiful.
But I've forgotten everything.

171
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,136
You don't know what you're saying.

172
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,568
Keep reading.
You're not in Atlantis yet.

173
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:32,404
You don't look like us.

174
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:34,945
Wear these to be like a soldier.

175
00:20:48,294 --> 00:20:51,263
The cadet will rob anyone,
especially corpses.

176
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:53,592
You'll smell of death even more now.

177
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:40,108
You should have stayed at home.

178
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,706
I want to fight.

179
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:44,678
I hate childishness.

180
00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:47,279
It won't work with me.

181
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:51,921
I know why you're clinging to us.

182
00:21:55,794 --> 00:21:58,262
You don't look like you want to live.

183
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:01,330
You look like someone...

184
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:03,925
who's known hardship.

185
00:22:05,904 --> 00:22:06,871
A lot of it.

186
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:10,707
You're clinging to us
so you can die?

187
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,109
No, not at all.

188
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:18,811
You're looking for something.
I don't know what.

189
00:22:19,752 --> 00:22:21,549
I can't worry about that.

190
00:22:22,388 --> 00:22:24,856
I want to get my men out alive.

191
00:22:25,624 --> 00:22:28,354
I won't put them at risk, understand?

192
00:22:29,328 --> 00:22:33,526
I'll hand you over to the authorities
once we reach the front.

193
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:36,394
They punish boys who want to fight?

194
00:22:36,535 --> 00:22:39,095
I won't let you set a bad example

195
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:42,741
or give ideas to my men,
dumb ideas.

196
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:46,211
I don't have any bad ideas.

197
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,175
You don't know yourself then?

198
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:06,497
Since I can't get rid of you,
do me a favour.

199
00:23:06,632 --> 00:23:07,929
Leave them be.

200
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:09,964
Don't bother them.

201
00:23:11,336 --> 00:23:13,133
They need to stay focused.

202
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,377
I, the blind girl

203
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,917
It may be the influence
of the seasons

204
00:24:05,057 --> 00:24:08,117
But I can tell I'm back in France

205
00:24:08,293 --> 00:24:10,693
I slept badly last night

206
00:24:12,064 --> 00:24:15,761
I dreamt of England
I was expecting

207
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:19,428
The last child of a little lord

208
00:24:22,674 --> 00:24:27,839
He was caressing me
Saying things I didn't understand

209
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:32,078
I wish I could have known

210
00:24:32,217 --> 00:24:35,209
The colour of his eyes

211
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:38,588
But I don't speak English

212
00:24:38,757 --> 00:24:42,158
He held me captive, I swear

213
00:24:43,228 --> 00:24:44,627
In his bedchamber

214
00:24:44,763 --> 00:24:48,722
There were long drapes everywhere

215
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:57,574
The little lord

216
00:24:57,709 --> 00:25:04,581
Came to me every night, I swear

217
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:09,614
In his bedchamber

218
00:25:09,755 --> 00:25:13,213
I beg you

219
00:25:13,592 --> 00:25:16,493
I must continue my journey now

220
00:25:22,568 --> 00:25:27,972
He was caressing me
Saying things I didn't understand

221
00:25:29,441 --> 00:25:32,308
I wish I could have known

222
00:25:32,444 --> 00:25:35,641
The colour of his eyes

223
00:25:36,515 --> 00:25:38,676
But I don't speak English

224
00:25:38,817 --> 00:25:42,719
He held me captive, I swear

225
00:25:43,522 --> 00:25:44,921
In his bedchamber

226
00:25:45,057 --> 00:25:49,619
There were long drapes everywhere

227
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:57,530
It may be
the influence of the seasons

228
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:59,500
But I must say farewell

229
00:25:59,638 --> 00:26:00,696
To the little lord

230
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:04,741
If I needed him

231
00:26:04,877 --> 00:26:07,243
Would he come to me?

232
00:26:11,917 --> 00:26:14,750
Would he come to me?

233
00:26:18,824 --> 00:26:21,952
Would he come to me?

234
00:27:17,449 --> 00:27:18,848
What's this?

235
00:27:18,984 --> 00:27:22,112
French soldiers who died in battle.

236
00:27:47,045 --> 00:27:49,775
Camille, it's not good
to stay here too long.

237
00:27:54,987 --> 00:27:56,614
And that one?

238
00:27:56,755 --> 00:27:58,188
A German soldier.

239
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:35,586
You know how to cook?

240
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:37,293
A little.

241
00:28:39,064 --> 00:28:41,555
Only one man here does a fine job.

242
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,260
Antoine's a schoolteacher.

243
00:28:44,436 --> 00:28:46,529
Do you clout your pupils?

244
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:48,570
Are you crazy? Look at him.

245
00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:51,005
He's the soul of kindness.

246
00:28:51,143 --> 00:28:52,804
His pupils all get top marks.

247
00:28:52,978 --> 00:28:55,139
My teacher used to belt me.

248
00:28:55,313 --> 00:28:57,178
You were rude to her?

249
00:28:57,315 --> 00:28:59,442
No, but I was slow.

250
00:28:59,618 --> 00:29:01,142
I held the others back.

251
00:29:02,187 --> 00:29:03,620
Like us now.

252
00:29:19,337 --> 00:29:21,498
Did you like school, Frédéric?

253
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:27,771
It's ready.

254
00:29:40,358 --> 00:29:42,087
You seem calm tonight.

255
00:29:45,263 --> 00:29:46,423
Young Camille...

256
00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:52,836
I'm not hungry.

257
00:29:52,971 --> 00:29:54,768
I'll get more wood.

258
00:30:27,472 --> 00:30:29,269
What are you doing here?

259
00:30:30,642 --> 00:30:32,769
We're heading up to the front.

260
00:30:33,345 --> 00:30:34,004
And the others?

261
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:41,885
Gone for food. They'll be back soon.

262
00:30:43,922 --> 00:30:44,650
Who are you?

263
00:30:45,223 --> 00:30:47,783
Georges Guibert, liaison officer.

264
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:50,393
I'm Camille. Camille Robin.

265
00:30:51,897 --> 00:30:54,161
Can I ask you something, Georges?

266
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:56,133
Go ahead.

267
00:31:00,338 --> 00:31:01,862
Any news of the 30th?

268
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,372
I can't give out that information.

269
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:07,603
Who do you think I am? The postman?

270
00:31:07,746 --> 00:31:09,873
I need to know.

271
00:31:10,015 --> 00:31:12,176
You're not allowed to know.

272
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:19,250
Here, this was a present.
I'm very fond of it.

273
00:31:21,226 --> 00:31:22,955
I don't care if you are.

274
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,688
Is it worth much?

275
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:28,196
Yes, it's gold.

276
00:31:33,905 --> 00:31:35,395
The news isn't good.

277
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:37,402
Meaning?

278
00:31:42,247 --> 00:31:44,647
With the dead and the prisoners...

279
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:47,617
that regiment's nearly gone.

280
00:31:48,954 --> 00:31:50,945
Where are the prisoners?

281
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,723
No idea.

282
00:31:55,327 --> 00:31:57,261
I have to go now.

283
00:31:58,029 --> 00:31:59,394
You fooled me.

284
00:32:00,332 --> 00:32:01,924
This isn't worth much.

285
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:29,017
I thought he'd never leave.

286
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,855
You're a talkative one.

287
00:32:31,496 --> 00:32:33,794
He was just a liaison officer.

288
00:32:33,932 --> 00:32:35,399
Why were you up there?

289
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:38,093
No reason. A false alarm.

290
00:32:43,975 --> 00:32:45,772
Lieutenant!

291
00:32:46,745 --> 00:32:49,578
Is it true
what he said about the 30th?

292
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,751
You think we're stupid?

293
00:33:01,893 --> 00:33:04,361
Who was that soldier earlier?

294
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,164
Why these questions about the 30th?

295
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:12,626
We weren't born yesterday.

296
00:33:12,771 --> 00:33:14,898
We spot them right away.

297
00:33:16,374 --> 00:33:18,137
What are you talking about?

298
00:33:18,276 --> 00:33:21,109
About guys who follow soldiers,

299
00:33:21,246 --> 00:33:23,476
who pretend to be with us,

300
00:33:23,615 --> 00:33:25,515
who are there when we need them,

301
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:28,016
then tell the Germans everything.

302
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:31,218
I'm not a spy.

303
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:06,890
The bastard!

304
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:17,427
No time to look for him.
Let's get going.

305
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:53,986
I was unfair with you.
It can't be helped.

306
00:36:56,127 --> 00:36:58,027
I'm sticking with you anyway.

307
00:37:01,065 --> 00:37:02,589
You're wrong.

308
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:06,800
You're a stranger among us.

309
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,706
Whatever you do,
you'll stay a stranger.

310
00:37:11,876 --> 00:37:13,776
Not anymore, I think.

311
00:37:16,347 --> 00:37:18,110
You're different.

312
00:37:18,249 --> 00:37:20,080
I know that.

313
00:37:22,587 --> 00:37:24,384
And don't ask me why.

314
00:38:11,202 --> 00:38:13,796
I, the blind girl

315
00:38:14,505 --> 00:38:18,805
I wasn't seeking favours, only work

316
00:38:18,943 --> 00:38:24,813
I left at seventeen for Italy

317
00:38:27,051 --> 00:38:32,148
Tell your prophets to pray for me

318
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:39,119
For I am still unemployed

319
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:47,771
I met a man from Turin
at the age of twenty

320
00:38:49,574 --> 00:38:52,543
Some things are beautiful

321
00:38:57,782 --> 00:39:02,242
For the things that men have made

322
00:39:05,423 --> 00:39:09,917
Live on throughout the years

323
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:34,479
But work has no meaning

324
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:42,085
Unless it absorbs you completely

325
00:39:47,065 --> 00:39:49,966
Are you asleep, my brother?

326
00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:57,503
You who have stayed on the front

327
00:39:57,642 --> 00:39:59,405
Listen to this

328
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:07,178
Listen to this, little brother

329
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:10,977
If I needed him

330
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:15,559
Would he come to me?

331
00:40:16,794 --> 00:40:21,424
Would he come to me?

332
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:27,195
Would he come to me?

333
00:40:31,142 --> 00:40:32,268
Lieutenant Paulhan,

334
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:35,208
80th infantry regiment,
12th company.

335
00:40:35,847 --> 00:40:37,337
And the others?

336
00:40:37,482 --> 00:40:38,847
Private Marin,

337
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:42,211
Private Briançon, Private Périnelle,

338
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,683
Private Cohen,

339
00:40:44,822 --> 00:40:47,757
Private Ménicourt,
Private Lamouroux and the others.

340
00:40:49,227 --> 00:40:50,854
What are you doing out?

341
00:40:50,995 --> 00:40:53,122
We're joining the 26th regiment.

342
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:57,496
Go on. I'll make my report.

343
00:40:57,635 --> 00:41:00,229
What's that uniform?

344
00:41:00,371 --> 00:41:01,804
His clothes were stolen.

345
00:41:01,939 --> 00:41:05,272
We'll see the quartermaster
to get him new ones.

346
00:41:49,187 --> 00:41:50,654
We'll stop here.

347
00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:54,652
The front is a mile or so that way.

348
00:41:56,894 --> 00:41:57,918
All right...

349
00:41:58,863 --> 00:42:00,330
The branch there.

350
00:42:01,866 --> 00:42:03,493
The trunk there.

351
00:42:04,502 --> 00:42:05,491
Move it!

352
00:42:19,984 --> 00:42:22,851
You remember the story
of Private Philippe?

353
00:42:29,093 --> 00:42:32,654
Jacques, tell Camille.
He doesn't know it.

354
00:42:41,505 --> 00:42:42,631
Tell him!

355
00:43:00,524 --> 00:43:03,755
It's the story of a soldier
called Philippe.

356
00:43:03,895 --> 00:43:05,157
He's twenty.

357
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:09,158
He's been fighting
for eighteen months.

358
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:18,174
Before the war,
he was young and handsome,

359
00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:19,970
with blue eyes.

360
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,270
He has a pretty sister.

361
00:43:24,782 --> 00:43:26,079
Alice.

362
00:43:26,918 --> 00:43:29,352
He has shown her photo
to all the others.

363
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:33,113
She is blond,

364
00:43:33,658 --> 00:43:37,253
with blue eyes,
blue as the ocean's depths.

365
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:44,558
He often writes long letters to her.

366
00:43:44,936 --> 00:43:46,528
He loves his sister.

367
00:43:52,009 --> 00:43:53,977
Letters that say things like:

368
00:43:54,278 --> 00:43:55,506
"Alice,

369
00:43:56,247 --> 00:43:58,511
"It was a beautiful day today.

370
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:02,117
"The moon was shining in the sky
at five p.m.

371
00:44:03,354 --> 00:44:06,721
"It's odd
but that's what happened.

372
00:44:10,261 --> 00:44:13,389
"The birds sang all day
but then fell silent

373
00:44:14,031 --> 00:44:16,124
"'when night started to fall."

374
00:44:20,404 --> 00:44:22,668
He certainly knows how to write.

375
00:44:22,807 --> 00:44:24,240
Not like us.

376
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:26,673
Well, I don't mean you, Antoine.

377
00:44:27,678 --> 00:44:31,011
In real life, he's a student.
A history student.

378
00:44:33,084 --> 00:44:35,109
He loves Greek history.

379
00:44:35,252 --> 00:44:37,083
He always talks about it.

380
00:44:38,155 --> 00:44:40,783
He loves giving details about it.

381
00:44:40,925 --> 00:44:43,621
He can translate anything into Greek.

382
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:50,923
He has a passion: Atlantis.

383
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,141
He loves to sleep.

384
00:45:02,046 --> 00:45:06,005
Some love to eat or drink.
He loves to sleep.

385
00:45:06,884 --> 00:45:08,784
In any case, he needs to sleep.

386
00:45:13,024 --> 00:45:15,618
You can't sleep when you want
in a war.

387
00:45:16,961 --> 00:45:20,488
He gets woken in the middle
of the night or at dawn.

388
00:45:20,631 --> 00:45:23,464
He sleeps three hours,
then has to get up.

389
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:26,502
Two hours, then he has to get up...

390
00:45:29,106 --> 00:45:32,234
Sometimes, he doesn't sleep
for two or three days.

391
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,004
It makes him ill.

392
00:45:38,682 --> 00:45:40,809
That's what Philippe is like.

393
00:45:42,987 --> 00:45:44,511
Then, little by little,

394
00:45:47,725 --> 00:45:51,923
he talks less and less
about Atlantis.

395
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:00,261
He says he's not interested.
He doesn't want to talk about it.

396
00:46:01,338 --> 00:46:03,135
He says none of it is any use.

397
00:46:07,678 --> 00:46:11,114
Even when we ask him questions,
he refuses...

398
00:46:12,616 --> 00:46:14,083
to answer them.

399
00:46:17,254 --> 00:46:20,382
He can't sleep.
He won't talk about the Greeks.

400
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,791
He even stops writing to Alice.

401
00:46:29,066 --> 00:46:32,695
Little by little, he talks
less and less about Atlantis.

402
00:46:36,407 --> 00:46:38,875
He says he's not interested.

403
00:46:39,276 --> 00:46:41,574
He doesn't want to talk about it.

404
00:46:42,146 --> 00:46:43,545
He says none of it...

405
00:46:44,949 --> 00:46:46,473
is any use.

406
00:50:12,923 --> 00:50:15,050
What are you doing?

407
00:50:20,798 --> 00:50:22,026
We're not soldiers now.

408
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:24,267
What do you mean?

409
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:26,563
Because of Philippe.

410
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:28,870
- He doesn't exist!
- Watch it!

411
00:50:29,006 --> 00:50:30,473
Calm down.

412
00:50:36,246 --> 00:50:40,114
We'd been together since
January 1916. We were very close.

413
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:43,881
Then, one day last April,

414
00:50:44,822 --> 00:50:47,689
we were ordered to attack once again.

415
00:50:48,759 --> 00:50:51,523
It was April 20.
I'll always remember.

416
00:50:52,663 --> 00:50:55,632
I saw Philippe
turn as white as a sheet.

417
00:50:55,766 --> 00:50:57,666
I'd never seen him like that.

418
00:50:58,268 --> 00:50:59,826
He stood up.

419
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:04,205
He started to speak,
saying he didn't want to go.

420
00:51:06,243 --> 00:51:08,336
I tried to reason with him.

421
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,445
I didn't want him punished.

422
00:51:11,582 --> 00:51:13,812
I didn't want his record hurt.

423
00:51:15,986 --> 00:51:18,079
So I swore to him

424
00:51:18,222 --> 00:51:20,656
that he would be like before.

425
00:51:22,493 --> 00:51:23,858
Just like before...

426
00:52:03,534 --> 00:52:05,434
We ran off along the pipe.

427
00:52:07,671 --> 00:52:10,265
Then I heard him cry out.

428
00:52:11,108 --> 00:52:14,271
I heard Philippe cry out,
"Lieutenant!"

429
00:52:14,912 --> 00:52:16,345
I turned for a second

430
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,472
and I saw him
on the ground behind us.

431
00:52:19,616 --> 00:52:21,811
The German fire started raking us.

432
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,279
They had made it in too.

433
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:29,391
We had no choice.

434
00:52:32,029 --> 00:52:33,428
What did you do?

435
00:52:33,597 --> 00:52:36,794
The only thing we could do.
We left Philippe there

436
00:52:36,934 --> 00:52:38,731
and we ran,

437
00:52:38,869 --> 00:52:40,700
ran as fast as we could.

438
00:52:42,606 --> 00:52:43,595
And then?

439
00:52:47,478 --> 00:52:49,173
Then...

440
00:52:50,447 --> 00:52:52,278
we went back,

441
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:54,509
had leave and never returned.

442
00:52:54,651 --> 00:52:55,811
And we're alive.

443
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:00,650
And now?

444
00:53:02,025 --> 00:53:03,652
We're deserters!

445
00:53:29,987 --> 00:53:32,217
It's the only spot on the river.

446
00:53:32,356 --> 00:53:34,654
Once we cross, we'll be in Belgium.

447
00:53:39,663 --> 00:53:41,392
La Douce is just back there.

448
00:53:42,266 --> 00:53:44,257
That bastard will give the alert.

449
00:53:58,315 --> 00:53:59,475
Camille!

450
00:55:17,027 --> 00:55:18,858
What does this gesture mean?

451
00:55:19,963 --> 00:55:22,158
It means he had three children.

452
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,438
Where did you get that?

453
00:55:38,649 --> 00:55:41,277
There's a farm nearby.
I helped myself.

454
00:55:41,685 --> 00:55:43,585
I never taught you to pilfer.

455
00:55:44,254 --> 00:55:46,051
You're putting us at risk,

456
00:55:46,623 --> 00:55:48,250
you thieving idiot.

457
00:55:49,593 --> 00:55:51,458
What do I do? Take them back?

458
00:55:55,132 --> 00:55:57,965
Here, eat.

459
00:55:58,101 --> 00:56:00,069
You can't let yourself starve.

460
00:56:09,613 --> 00:56:11,843
We mean bad luck now anyway.

461
00:56:14,851 --> 00:56:17,843
We weren't ashamed of you before
but now...

462
00:56:19,956 --> 00:56:22,584
You can never tell your fiancée this.

463
00:56:22,726 --> 00:56:24,660
You'll have a secret.

464
00:56:24,828 --> 00:56:26,557
I don't know where she is.

465
00:56:28,832 --> 00:56:30,459
You don't know?

466
00:56:33,136 --> 00:56:34,262
No.

467
00:56:35,472 --> 00:56:37,372
She's a long way from home.

468
00:56:37,874 --> 00:56:39,466
I don't know where she is.

469
00:56:40,844 --> 00:56:42,368
If she's alive or dead.

470
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:11,664
I, the blind girl

471
00:57:11,808 --> 00:57:16,643
I'll walk along the ramparts

472
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:22,241
I have a tendency to do that

473
00:57:22,385 --> 00:57:27,220
My path is marked out before me

474
00:57:27,357 --> 00:57:31,487
But I need

475
00:57:31,628 --> 00:57:36,327
To find those cardboard ramparts

476
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,935
It will soon be too late

477
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:45,007
I've promised my lover

478
00:57:45,575 --> 00:57:49,841
A German who's hard of hearing

479
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:54,576
The idiot doesn't know France

480
00:57:55,118 --> 00:57:58,451
I told him, "It doesn't matter

481
00:58:00,223 --> 00:58:04,353
"As long as you don't tell anyone"

482
00:58:04,494 --> 00:58:08,021
He's hard of hearing

483
00:58:08,165 --> 00:58:09,894
I'll guide him

484
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:15,070
And he'll tell me what he sees

485
00:58:15,205 --> 00:58:20,006
Who am I to judge him?

486
00:58:20,177 --> 00:58:25,513
My eyes are dull, my steps are slow

487
00:58:25,649 --> 00:58:29,244
Sometimes, his eyes

488
00:58:29,553 --> 00:58:33,853
Try to express things for me

489
00:58:34,591 --> 00:58:37,788
If I needed him

490
00:58:42,232 --> 00:58:44,598
Would he come to me?

491
00:58:44,734 --> 00:58:47,032
Would he come to me?

492
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:49,968
Would he come to me?

493
00:58:52,075 --> 00:58:54,441
Would he come to me?

494
00:58:54,578 --> 00:58:57,069
Would he come to me?

495
00:58:57,214 --> 00:59:01,378
Would he come to me?

496
00:59:02,052 --> 00:59:04,452
Would he come to me?

497
00:59:04,588 --> 00:59:06,954
Would he come to me?

498
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:10,821
Would he come to me?

499
00:59:12,162 --> 00:59:14,528
Would he come to me?

500
00:59:14,664 --> 00:59:16,962
Would he come to me?

501
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:21,560
Would he come to me?

502
00:59:22,205 --> 00:59:24,537
Would he come to me?

503
00:59:24,674 --> 00:59:27,108
Would he come to me?

504
00:59:27,244 --> 00:59:31,340
Would he come to me?

505
00:59:32,282 --> 00:59:34,648
Would he come to me?

506
00:59:34,784 --> 00:59:37,116
Would he come to me?

507
00:59:37,254 --> 00:59:40,485
Would he come to me?

508
00:59:42,392 --> 00:59:44,724
Would he come to me?

509
00:59:44,861 --> 00:59:47,329
Would he come to me?

510
00:59:47,464 --> 00:59:50,956
Would he come to me?

511
00:59:52,636 --> 00:59:55,104
Would he come to me?

512
00:59:55,238 --> 00:59:57,570
Would he come to me?

513
00:59:57,707 --> 01:00:00,437
Would he come to me?

514
01:00:42,986 --> 01:00:44,078
Camille!

515
01:00:55,732 --> 01:00:58,758
I've written about this photo
of my parents.

516
01:00:58,902 --> 01:01:00,870
- Can I read it to you?
- Yes.

517
01:01:04,274 --> 01:01:07,072
"Oh God, when I return to my past,

518
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:08,939
"my family is full of beauties.

519
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:11,274
"My mother had such red hair,

520
01:01:11,414 --> 01:01:14,781
"it looked like a spring fire
someone knocked over.

521
01:01:14,918 --> 01:01:16,545
"This was in the 80's.

522
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,150
"I was still a baby at the time.

523
01:01:22,592 --> 01:01:26,653
"She was a religious woman,
without the joy of Catholicism

524
01:01:27,063 --> 01:01:30,032
"which, if need be,
covers the marks on the wall

525
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:32,225
"when family portraits fall.

526
01:01:32,802 --> 01:01:35,100
"'She wore a hat like a tabletop,

527
01:01:35,805 --> 01:01:38,069
"her bosom in a motley corset

528
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:41,609
"and my father sitting stiffly
next to her.

529
01:01:42,278 --> 01:01:44,940
"He wore an absurd,
little yellow jacket

530
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:48,448
"and a tobacco brown bowler
perched on his ears.

531
01:01:48,952 --> 01:01:50,579
"He must have been furious

532
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,188
"'because he was squinting strangely.

533
01:01:53,323 --> 01:01:55,553
"'Perhaps ideas about my mother

534
01:01:55,692 --> 01:01:57,887
"in an area where he held no sway."

535
01:01:59,229 --> 01:02:00,491
What do you think?

536
01:02:01,297 --> 01:02:03,424
I don't know anything about that.

537
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,592
I'm a bit disappointed.

538
01:02:16,679 --> 01:02:20,012
He thinks he's a writer,
but he's never written a book.

539
01:02:20,483 --> 01:02:22,144
I bet he never will.

540
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:25,417
I hope minds are small there

541
01:02:25,855 --> 01:02:27,288
but not narrow.

542
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:31,556
Minds...
That's all you ever talk about.

543
01:02:32,095 --> 01:02:35,861
It means we can't live like you.
Eat, sleep, drink...

544
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:38,225
We don't really sleep anymore.

545
01:02:39,402 --> 01:02:42,064
All we can do
is be ashamed or scared,

546
01:02:42,539 --> 01:02:43,938
standing or lying.

547
01:02:44,741 --> 01:02:47,335
I hope ill be like Atlantis,

548
01:02:48,044 --> 01:02:49,170
that's all.

549
01:02:54,651 --> 01:02:56,710
"The night suits the risks..."

550
01:02:56,853 --> 01:02:57,979
Cut it out!

551
01:03:43,133 --> 01:03:44,225
I can't feel my leg!

552
01:04:13,129 --> 01:04:14,460
Help!

553
01:04:23,606 --> 01:04:25,005
Help!

554
01:05:03,746 --> 01:05:04,678
Get up!

555
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,032
We heard you shouting.

556
01:06:07,243 --> 01:06:08,801
You're lucky.

557
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:11,806
Not many people pass this way.

558
01:06:14,284 --> 01:06:16,275
My name's Elias.

559
01:06:16,419 --> 01:06:18,114
This is my son.

560
01:06:22,392 --> 01:06:23,859
Lieutenant Paulhan,

561
01:06:23,993 --> 01:06:27,224
80th infantry regiment,
12th company.

562
01:06:29,565 --> 01:06:31,055
Where are you going?

563
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:35,399
What are you doing here?

564
01:06:43,279 --> 01:06:44,803
Thank you for your help.

565
01:06:49,886 --> 01:06:51,581
We'll look after them.

566
01:06:52,789 --> 01:06:54,017
Follow me.

567
01:07:02,765 --> 01:07:05,325
You don't want to talk.
You must be tired.

568
01:07:05,468 --> 01:07:07,163
Everyone is tired here.

569
01:07:08,905 --> 01:07:12,341
We know what it means
to be tired too.

570
01:07:12,809 --> 01:07:15,471
Sometimes,
we don't want to talk either.

571
01:07:16,179 --> 01:07:17,578
My dad and I

572
01:07:18,715 --> 01:07:20,478
will look after you,

573
01:07:21,617 --> 01:07:23,209
we'll feed you

574
01:07:23,853 --> 01:07:26,822
and everything will be fine after,
you'll see.

575
01:07:28,191 --> 01:07:30,421
Try to rest now.

576
01:07:40,036 --> 01:07:41,094
Thank you.

577
01:07:52,749 --> 01:07:55,650
It must have been good here
before the war.

578
01:08:06,195 --> 01:08:07,560
Me and my son

579
01:08:08,631 --> 01:08:10,531
can only come after dark.

580
01:08:12,268 --> 01:08:14,532
Otherwise,
the locals might see us

581
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:17,161
and then they'll denounce you.

582
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:21,807
Denounce us?

583
01:08:25,148 --> 01:08:27,480
I saw right away you were deserters.

584
01:08:31,854 --> 01:08:33,082
How?

585
01:08:35,191 --> 01:08:37,352
By the state of your uniforms.

586
01:08:38,494 --> 01:08:40,359
And the number of you.

587
01:08:41,731 --> 01:08:44,928
And your cadet too.
He talked to my son.

588
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:49,295
He spoke about your journey.

589
01:08:51,874 --> 01:08:53,273
And about things...

590
01:08:54,644 --> 01:08:56,441
Things that you have seen.

591
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,604
He isn't very smart.

592
01:09:03,286 --> 01:09:05,686
There's the look on your face too.

593
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,288
What look?

594
01:09:13,329 --> 01:09:15,695
I won't say. Ill only scare you.

595
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:23,397
What do you risk by hiding us?

596
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:26,765
A lot. But it doesn't matter.

597
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:29,401
You've done so much for us.

598
01:09:31,013 --> 01:09:33,504
I have one favour left to ask of you.

599
01:09:37,053 --> 01:09:40,284
Could you send

600
01:09:42,725 --> 01:09:46,923
my dog tag to this address?

601
01:09:48,197 --> 01:09:51,166
It's for my superior.
It's very important.

602
01:09:51,701 --> 01:09:53,566
He'll know what it means.

603
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:56,135
Yes, I'll do it.

604
01:09:59,375 --> 01:10:01,843
I'll bring you local maps tomorrow.

605
01:10:02,578 --> 01:10:04,068
You have to be careful.

606
01:12:29,859 --> 01:12:31,156
Alfred!

607
01:12:34,263 --> 01:12:35,491
Camille...

608
01:13:00,523 --> 01:13:02,013
My son!

609
01:15:23,299 --> 01:15:26,166
Shit, they'll find the bodies.

610
01:16:28,197 --> 01:16:31,132
I'm Camille Robin,
wife of François Robin.

611
01:16:32,902 --> 01:16:35,268
François is like you.
He's a soldier.

612
01:16:37,406 --> 01:16:39,874
When I met him,
he had an open smile.

613
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:43,003
Not a smile like yours, Alfred.

614
01:16:43,979 --> 01:16:46,140
Not like yours either, Antoine.

615
01:16:49,251 --> 01:16:52,084
An open smile
like someone without worries.

616
01:17:01,664 --> 01:17:03,825
On our wedding day, I was sick,

617
01:17:04,667 --> 01:17:06,635
so sick I could hardly stand.

618
01:17:07,202 --> 01:17:10,035
People kept saying
the bride looked odd.

619
01:17:10,606 --> 01:17:13,575
I told myself
that I had to last the day out,

620
01:17:14,176 --> 01:17:16,007
that I could collapse after,

621
01:17:16,145 --> 01:17:18,136
but that I had to keep going.

622
01:17:23,585 --> 01:17:27,453
That evening, François said
I'd never been more beautiful.

623
01:17:32,695 --> 01:17:35,892
You've no idea
how happy I was with my husband.

624
01:17:38,834 --> 01:17:41,200
My sister was even a bit jealous.

625
01:17:48,544 --> 01:17:50,705
When he left, he wrote often,

626
01:17:51,246 --> 01:17:53,009
as often as he could.

627
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:56,449
And then nothing.

628
01:18:02,424 --> 01:18:03,789
I waited.

629
01:18:03,926 --> 01:18:05,416
I didn't worry.

630
01:18:07,429 --> 01:18:09,090
And then I had a letter.

631
01:18:10,532 --> 01:18:13,933
"Camille, I don't want you
to write back to me.

632
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:17,166
"You'll never see me again.
François."

633
01:18:18,807 --> 01:18:20,104
That was all.

634
01:18:21,577 --> 01:18:24,569
He's been badly advised.
He's been misled.

635
01:18:25,848 --> 01:18:27,509
He must have nightmares.

636
01:18:29,451 --> 01:18:31,612
I bet he wrote after a nightmare.

637
01:18:34,089 --> 01:18:35,784
The nights are cold.

638
01:18:36,325 --> 01:18:38,190
You can't think straight.

639
01:18:39,762 --> 01:18:41,855
The noise of the front is scary too.

640
01:18:44,967 --> 01:18:47,435
You never know
what tomorrow will bring.

641
01:18:49,505 --> 01:18:51,769
The war has come between us.

642
01:18:54,943 --> 01:18:56,535
But once it is over,

643
01:18:57,613 --> 01:19:01,549
once I find François again,
once he sees he was wrong...

644
01:19:01,717 --> 01:19:03,480
Are you an orphan though?

645
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:05,918
No.

646
01:19:07,356 --> 01:19:10,189
Not even?
I feel like smashing your face in.

647
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:14,552
You must love your husband a lot
to do this.

648
01:19:15,497 --> 01:19:16,623
Yes.

649
01:19:16,832 --> 01:19:18,697
Sure you love him that much?

650
01:19:19,001 --> 01:19:20,059
Yes.

651
01:19:23,572 --> 01:19:24,630
I didn't fool you.

652
01:19:27,042 --> 01:19:29,272
And now, Camille...

653
01:19:30,279 --> 01:19:31,974
What do you plan to do?

654
01:19:34,716 --> 01:19:35,910
I don't know.

655
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,581
I don't know where he is,

656
01:19:39,721 --> 01:19:41,655
if he's dead or alive.

657
01:19:44,726 --> 01:19:46,023
So I'm following you.

658
01:19:46,695 --> 01:19:49,129
That way, I feel as if I'm with him.

659
01:19:52,134 --> 01:19:55,331
Camille told you a tall story, true,

660
01:19:55,471 --> 01:19:57,735
but that's no reason to change.

661
01:19:59,408 --> 01:20:02,434
Everything must stay like before.

662
01:20:02,578 --> 01:20:04,569
For you too, Camille.

663
01:20:06,648 --> 01:20:08,445
Keep your male clothing.

664
01:20:12,521 --> 01:20:14,546
If you get yourself noticed,

665
01:20:15,891 --> 01:20:17,586
we could get caught.

666
01:20:19,428 --> 01:20:21,225
My sole concern

667
01:20:21,363 --> 01:20:23,888
is to get us to Holland
safe and sound.

668
01:20:25,734 --> 01:20:28,601
You're just as full of infamy
as we are.

669
01:20:56,298 --> 01:20:59,233
Camille, I can help you too.

670
01:21:40,542 --> 01:21:42,874
Wait here, I'll fetch the cadet!

671
01:21:55,457 --> 01:21:56,685
I can't see him.

672
01:21:56,825 --> 01:21:58,656
We can't stay here. Let's go!

673
01:23:33,322 --> 01:23:34,812
Here lies Thibault Marin,

674
01:23:34,956 --> 01:23:36,355
alias "the cadet"'.

675
01:23:37,826 --> 01:23:39,350
May he rest in peace.

676
01:23:53,742 --> 01:23:55,903
He's waiting for us in Atlantis,

677
01:23:56,044 --> 01:23:57,170
in Holland,

678
01:23:57,312 --> 01:24:00,179
wherever there are orphans
full of infamy.

679
01:26:00,635 --> 01:26:03,502
I, the blind girl

680
01:26:04,539 --> 01:26:06,632
I'll tell you one last time

681
01:26:06,775 --> 01:26:09,710
Put your head on my shoulder

682
01:26:10,579 --> 01:26:13,173
You Pole, there's a room

683
01:26:13,315 --> 01:26:18,184
Where I'll tell you all my secrets

684
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:21,917
It's my bedroom so come to me

685
01:26:22,324 --> 01:26:25,816
It's dark, I'm alone

686
01:26:25,961 --> 01:26:28,521
And I won't be afraid

687
01:26:28,663 --> 01:26:31,063
I love the way you dress

688
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:35,829
I'd like France to be invaded
by Poland

689
01:26:35,971 --> 01:26:38,371
I feel pleasant vibrations

690
01:26:38,507 --> 01:26:39,701
Close my eyes

691
01:26:40,642 --> 01:26:43,406
You seem much closer now

692
01:26:43,545 --> 01:26:46,537
I must keep these vibrations of love

693
01:26:46,748 --> 01:26:48,238
I have seen many things

694
01:26:48,383 --> 01:26:52,479
But Poland is what I prefer

695
01:26:59,194 --> 01:27:01,856
If you leave me, I'll never

696
01:27:03,064 --> 01:27:04,929
Feel these vibrations again

697
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,864
It may be the influence
of the seasons

698
01:27:09,104 --> 01:27:11,572
How could I know?

699
01:27:11,873 --> 01:27:16,867
This morning, I opened the shutters

700
01:27:17,312 --> 01:27:22,579
You were looking at my belly again

701
01:27:23,818 --> 01:27:26,685
I had no time to promise you anything

702
01:27:26,855 --> 01:27:29,585
I love the way you dress

703
01:27:29,724 --> 01:27:34,457
I'd like France to be invaded
by Poland

704
01:27:34,596 --> 01:27:37,190
I feel pleasant vibrations

705
01:27:37,332 --> 01:27:38,526
Close my eyes

706
01:27:39,234 --> 01:27:41,998
You seem much closer now

707
01:27:42,137 --> 01:27:45,038
I must keep these vibrations of love

708
01:27:45,273 --> 01:27:47,002
I have seen many things

709
01:27:47,142 --> 01:27:51,078
But Poland is what I prefer

710
01:27:57,519 --> 01:28:00,283
You mustn't feel ashamed

711
01:28:01,389 --> 01:28:03,482
No, no, don't worry

712
01:28:03,625 --> 01:28:06,753
It wasn't your bedroom

713
01:28:07,696 --> 01:28:10,062
And it wasn't your country

714
01:28:10,332 --> 01:28:13,062
If I needed him

715
01:28:13,201 --> 01:28:16,102
Would he come to me?

716
01:28:16,905 --> 01:28:19,703
Would he come to me?

717
01:28:19,841 --> 01:28:22,969
Would he come to me?

718
01:28:23,111 --> 01:28:25,944
Would he come to me?

719
01:28:26,081 --> 01:28:30,017
Would he come to me?

720
01:29:17,832 --> 01:29:19,424
Where have you come from?

721
01:29:20,435 --> 01:29:21,959
From Beverloo.

722
01:29:22,537 --> 01:29:24,596
Let me by. I've done no harm.

723
01:29:26,541 --> 01:29:28,008
Beverloo?

724
01:29:29,444 --> 01:29:31,810
It's a prison camp in Belgium.

725
01:29:33,281 --> 01:29:34,805
I escaped.

726
01:29:36,918 --> 01:29:38,545
Where are you going?

727
01:29:39,654 --> 01:29:41,451
I'm going back to my country.

728
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:43,187
France.

729
01:29:44,959 --> 01:29:46,051
And then?

730
01:29:48,530 --> 01:29:49,690
Then?

731
01:29:50,765 --> 01:29:52,096
I don't know.

732
01:30:00,608 --> 01:30:01,666
Get up.

733
01:30:03,511 --> 01:30:04,808
I can't.

734
01:30:05,747 --> 01:30:07,237
I'm too tired.

735
01:30:08,216 --> 01:30:09,444
Get up.

736
01:30:12,854 --> 01:30:14,822
What do you know of my life?

737
01:30:19,594 --> 01:30:21,027
Stop complaining.

738
01:30:23,865 --> 01:30:25,799
Why are you crying, François?

739
01:30:28,103 --> 01:30:30,196
It's because my eyes hurt.

740
01:30:51,526 --> 01:30:52,754
Camille...

741
01:30:56,698 --> 01:30:57,995
Wait here.

742
01:31:08,576 --> 01:31:09,804
Well?

743
01:31:13,248 --> 01:31:15,079
I already told you.

744
01:31:15,216 --> 01:31:16,706
What?

745
01:31:18,119 --> 01:31:20,053
You just want to die.

746
01:31:22,023 --> 01:31:23,081
No.

747
01:31:23,858 --> 01:31:25,723
I wanted to find my husband.

748
01:31:27,028 --> 01:31:28,962
It's the same thing.

749
01:31:30,398 --> 01:31:32,389
We won't say goodbye, Camille.

750
01:32:55,149 --> 01:32:56,639
Slowly, François.

751
01:32:57,952 --> 01:32:59,385
Be more gentle.

752
01:33:01,389 --> 01:33:02,549
All right.

753
01:33:42,297 --> 01:33:43,696
Alfred...

754
01:33:44,732 --> 01:33:45,596
Jean...

755
01:33:47,068 --> 01:33:48,592
Antoine...

756
01:34:41,089 --> 01:34:46,356
The lieutenant and his men
never reached Holland.
