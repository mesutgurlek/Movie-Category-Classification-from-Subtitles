00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,925
? Have you ever
dreamed of a place ?

2
00:00:34,925 --> 00:00:38,468
? far away from it all? ?

3
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:44,677
? Where the air you breathe
is soft and clean ?

4
00:00:44,842 --> 00:00:49,925
? and children play
in fields of green ?

5
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:53,885
? and the sound of guns ?

6
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,134
? doesn’t pound in your ears. ?

7
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,802
? Have you ever
dreamed of a place ?

8
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,428
? far away from it all? ?

9
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:15,301
? Where the winter winds
will never blow ?

10
00:01:15,468 --> 00:01:20,136
? and living things
have room to grow ?

11
00:01:21,343 --> 00:01:25,261
? and the sound of guns ?

12
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:30,885
? doesn’t pound in your ears ?

13
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,217

? Many miles from yesterday ?

15
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,094
? before you reach tomorrow ?

16
00:01:42,217 --> 00:01:48,760
? where the time is
always just today. ?

17
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:54,635
? There’s a lost horizon ?

18
00:01:55,176 --> 00:01:59,385
? waiting to be found. ?

19
00:02:00,635 --> 00:02:03,927

? doesn’t pound in your ears ?

00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,719
? anymore. ?

23
00:02:52,092 --> 00:02:53,760
Wise, gimme that.

24
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:58,176
George, lets get out
as many as we can.

25
00:02:58,635 --> 00:02:59,927
Bring them out now.

26
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:32,343
Don't overload me Conway!

27
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:01,134
Mr. Lovett?

28
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,595
Calme vu.

29
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:05,637
It's all right.

30
00:04:06,134 --> 00:04:08,052
Plenty of planes are coming.

31
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,967
Patients, patients.

32
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:11,384
Please be patient.

33
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:13,344
Plenty of planes are coming.
Please.

34
00:04:14,677 --> 00:04:16,428
Don't worry. Everyone
will get away.

35
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:19,092
Please don't worry the
planes are coming.

36
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,635
Get me Hong Kong will you.

37
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,136
Talking to them sir.

38
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:27,050
Hello it's Conway here. Where are
those planes you promised me?

39
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,259
I still got a whole lot
of people to get out.

40
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,094
The whole towns on fire

41
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:30,760
and the guerrillas
are nearly here.

42
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,092
That runway won't
take heavy jets.

43
00:04:33,092 --> 00:04:34,843
We've sent you every
other plain we

44
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:36,509
could commandeer,
even freighters.

45
00:04:36,593 --> 00:04:37,885
Now, Fenner's in charge.

46
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:41,467
They should be there any time. Now,
take your people and clear out.

47
00:04:41,468 --> 00:04:44,386
My people! What about
the rest of them here?

48
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,718
Richard, Bill Ferguson here.

49
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:47,595
Yes Bill?

50
00:04:47,718 --> 00:04:50,801
We've had a lot of flak from
your local military authority.

51
00:04:50,842 --> 00:04:54,092
They have forbidden us to let you
evacuate any of their nationals.

52
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:58,052
The ST says you are to take only your
own group, only those you have listed.

53
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,050
Do you hear me?

54
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:02,886
- Yes, I hear you Bill, but it's not...
- Hey, it's the planes.

55
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:03,718
They're here.

56
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,386
Just a minute, we think
the planes are here.

57
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:07,261
Thank you.

58
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:10,092
Oh my god, whats happen.

59
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:11,593
They must have blown
up the generator.

60
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:12,595
Come on.

61
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:14,927
Those planes can't
land without light.

62
00:05:15,176 --> 00:05:17,136
Hello, Hong Kong.
Come in Hong Kong.

63
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:21,094
Let's go.

64
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:38,593
[Chele', Chele'!]

65
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:39,593
[Chele'!]

66
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:40,885
[Ah' roo cha']

67
00:05:58,842 --> 00:06:00,677
[Chele' Chele' Chele'
Chele' Chele']

68
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,345
Let's get back to
the main building.

69
00:06:30,134 --> 00:06:32,551
Here they are, now let
have the next group.

70
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:36,177
Only the women.

71
00:06:36,217 --> 00:06:39,217
All right quiet please,
just calm down.

72
00:06:39,384 --> 00:06:41,676
Hay Miss. Come on,
you get left behind.

73
00:06:41,718 --> 00:06:43,177
Let the heroes go first.

74
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:50,677
You an American?

75
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:53,050
No, Mongolian.

76
00:06:54,468 --> 00:06:56,510
You have to teach me
the language sometime.

77
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:05,428
He's away.

78
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,175
We go on the next plane. Bring
out everybody that's left.

79
00:07:08,217 --> 00:07:08,718
Right.

80
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:35,092
Hello Fenner.

81
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,969
Hello Conway.

82
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:38,426
Having a little trouble?

83
00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:39,344
Enough.

84
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:42,177
Does this thing really fly?

85
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:43,969
From time to time she does.

86
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:52,468
Over there. Keep them back.

87
00:08:33,217 --> 00:08:34,718
Tell Fenner to take off.

88
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:41,844
Fenner, let's go!

89
00:08:42,426 --> 00:08:43,094
Fenner!

90
00:08:46,343 --> 00:08:48,719
Get down! Get down on the floor!
Get down!

91
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:50,969
Fenner, come on!

92
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:53,094
Fenner, takeoff!

93
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:54,802
Come on Fenner!

94
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,261
Fenner!

95
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,843
Everybody all right?

96
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,553
Yeah, sure.

97
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,052
Now we all have a long
journey ahead of us.

98
00:09:46,092 --> 00:09:48,676
Now I suggest you make yourselves
as comfortable as possible.

99
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:49,303
Right?

100
00:09:49,343 --> 00:09:50,760
- Fine.
- OK.

101
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,009
G-George, see if you
can find some food.

102
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,219
Uh, where we heading?

103
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:00,426
Hong Kong.

104
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:03,050
Who are you? I don't
remember listing you.

105
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,760
Yeah, well I sort of
arrived the last minute.

106
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,426
Names Harry Lovett the comedian.

107
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,094
Just finished three solid weeks,
top of the bill, Saigon USO.

108
00:10:11,134 --> 00:10:12,927
Terrific audience those guys.
I love um'.

109
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:14,092
Saigon?

110
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:16,178
What were you doing in Baskul.

111
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:18,927
Yeah, well, we had a few drinks and
someone said "Let's go see the Temples."

112
00:10:18,925 --> 00:10:21,008
And there was this plane and
we had a few more drinks

113
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,300
and uh, all of a sudden we were
in the middle of the jungle.

114
00:10:23,301 --> 00:10:25,219
Temple of Baskulla
was pretty funny.

115
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:27,760
Then the shells start falling
and nobody's laughing.

116
00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:31,593
All right, I'll get some
particulars from you later.

117
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,760
Hi, name's Harry Lovett.

118
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,301
The Comedian.

119
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:42,593
Sam Cornelius. The Engineer.

120
00:11:00,635 --> 00:11:02,094
Milk and sandwiches.

121
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:05,468
Milk? Somebody at headquarters
has a sense of humor.

122
00:11:05,468 --> 00:11:06,219
Dish it out.

123
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:08,801
I'm going to make out my report,

124
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:10,677
while I can still
remember the details.

125
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:30,968
No thank you.

126
00:11:43,384 --> 00:11:44,676
Of course...

127
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,678
You're Sally Hughes,
of Newsweek.

128
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:47,553
Yes.

129
00:11:47,593 --> 00:11:49,802
I’m George Conway,
London Express.

130
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:50,927
Hello.

131
00:11:51,593 --> 00:11:52,885
Richards my brother.

132
00:11:52,883 --> 00:11:54,634
I was covering him
on the peace talks

133
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:55,969
when the whole thing blew up.

134
00:11:58,883 --> 00:12:01,175
Well did you get some good stuff
on the airfield just now?

135
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:02,510
Look, I'm through with all this!

136
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:03,801
And I'm tired.

137
00:12:11,635 --> 00:12:12,553
I'm sorry.

138
00:12:32,677 --> 00:12:35,512
The way Fenner is flying this
thing we're in for a rough night.

139
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,470
I uh, just found some jungle juice.
Can I freshen your milk?

140
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:39,802
Sure.

141
00:12:47,718 --> 00:12:48,595
It's pretty rough eh?

142
00:12:49,176 --> 00:12:50,011
Yeah.

143
00:12:50,343 --> 00:12:52,178
Were you on a
project back there?

144
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:55,843
Yeah.

145
00:12:57,593 --> 00:12:58,885
Really?

146
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:01,136
Really.

147
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,342
Well, take it easy.

148
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:18,052
Ah, well gentlemen, I ah,...

149
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:19,927
not been too
successful up front.

150
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,593
Could I interest you
in a little bourbon?

151
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,718
Oh, you're our man.

152
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,511
Yes.

153
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:28,843
Great.

154
00:13:30,217 --> 00:13:31,052
Great?

155
00:13:31,842 --> 00:13:33,426
Well, God Save the Queen.

156
00:13:34,635 --> 00:13:35,718
Cheers.

157
00:15:00,677 --> 00:15:02,760
Mr. Conway? Mr. Conway, wake up.

158
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,720
Look outside.

159
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:05,677
We're traveling in
the wrong direction.

160
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,301
Look, I know I
flunked boy scout,

161
00:15:07,301 --> 00:15:09,510
but from what I remember
the sun rises in the east.

162
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:13,345
Hong Kong is east,
we're going west.

163
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,677
He's right. The suns behind us.

164
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:20,301
It's desert down there.

165
00:15:21,925 --> 00:15:22,885
Must be a reason.

166
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:25,008
Fenner too good a

331
00:36:21,551 --> 00:36:25,219
If you should wish to assume our habits
of dress you will find suitable garments.

332
00:36:25,842 --> 00:36:27,468
You would need to rest now.

333
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,384
And later I shall be most pleased
to see you all at dinner.

334
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,927
Mr. Chang.

335
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:39,967
Please.

336
00:36:50,134 --> 00:36:52,760
I am happy to report that
the plane has arrived.

337
00:36:53,551 --> 00:36:55,052
With Richard Conway?

338
00:36:55,426 --> 00:36:57,551
With Conway and four others.

339
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:58,967
Excellent.

340
00:37:19,092 --> 00:37:20,384
What are we going to do now?

341
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,635
What we always do?

342
00:38:38,343 --> 00:38:39,677
- Miss. Hughes!
- Gasp!

343
00:38:44,009 --> 00:38:46,051
That is the coward's way out.

344
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:48,969
You are in the midst of life.

345
00:38:49,426 --> 00:38:52,344
Do not seek death,
it will find you.

346
00:38:53,343 --> 00:38:56,927
But choose the road that
makes death a fulfillment.

347
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,677
Good evening ladies and
gentlemen, a funny thing

348
00:39:16,718 --> 00:39:18,302
happened to me on the
way to the Airport.

349
00:39:30,009 --> 00:39:32,886
Get a load of the outfit
have Kimona will travel.

350
00:39:33,176 --> 00:39:34,510
Both look pretty silly.

351
00:39:34,593 --> 00:39:36,718
When in Rome, do
as the romans do.

352
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:38,552
C'mon, let's get something
to eat, take a quick look

353
00:39:38,593 --> 00:39:40,676
around the place, and catch
the first train out here.

354
00:39:41,468 --> 00:39:43,885
We've just crash a plane
in the middle of nowhere,

355
00:39:43,925 --> 00:39:45,967
spent all day dragging
ourselves up a mountain

356
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,885
and you're looking for the
nearest ticket office?

357
00:39:49,176 --> 00:39:50,969
Man, where do you
think we're gonna go?

358
00:40:00,343 --> 00:40:01,677
Um, suits you.

359
00:40:03,842 --> 00:40:05,301
I thought I might
find Chang here.

360
00:40:05,301 --> 00:40:06,510
No, sorry.

361
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,800
I'm not doing very well so
far I failed to find him or…

362
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,925
- Telephone or telex.
- Telex?

363
00:40:12,718 --> 00:40:14,718
Even a socket for my razor.

364
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,885
Hard luck.

365
00:40:16,468 --> 00:40:19,011
- You better use mine.
- Thanks.

366
00:40:19,677 --> 00:40:21,595
Seriously, I must get
in touch with my paper.

367
00:40:21,635 --> 00:40:23,927
Well an hour or two won't
make any difference will it?

368
00:40:23,925 --> 00:40:26,509
It does to me. I want to get
this story off before we eat.

369
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:28,345
And I want a few more
peaceful moments

370
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,801
before the world gets its
claws into me again.

371
00:40:30,842 --> 00:40:32,677
Oh well, in that case,

372
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:35,718
I'll make a big sacrifice.
I'll shave and shut up.

373
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,511
Thank you George,
I'm very grateful.

374
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:39,176
Until dinner.

375
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:56,217
? Friendly doors open wide ?

376
00:40:56,217 --> 00:41:02,094
? Come and share the peace and
life you will find inside ?

377
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:05,384
? Share the joy ?

378
00:41:06,343 --> 00:41:10,802
? Let the sun comfort you ?

379
00:41:10,883 --> 00:41:16,676
? It will keep you safe and
warm, always shining through ?

380
00:41:16,718 --> 00:41:20,052
? Share the joy ?

381
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:25,802
? All the lovely songs
you will hear, ?

382
00:41:26,593 --> 00:41:29,885
? means we all hold dear ?

383
00:41:30,967 --> 00:41:33,426
? At the same time ?

384
00:41:33,551 --> 00:41:38,135
? All the grandest
things we possess, ?

385
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,969
? means we value less ?

386
00:41:41,009 --> 00:41:45,635
? So many small things
can bring happiness ?

387
00:41:45,883 --> 00:41:53,217
? Love is in all things ?

388
00:41:53,468 --> 00:41:57,551
? Flowers bloom, people grow ?

389
00:41:57,635 --> 00:42:03,553
? You may never want to leave
when it's time to go ?

390
00:42:03,551 --> 00:42:06,261
? Share the joy ?

391
00:42:07,967 --> 00:42:12,217
? Mountains rise,
mountains fall ?

392
00:42:12,301 --> 00:42:18,136
? You have nothing more to prove,
you have climbed them all ?

393
00:42:18,468 --> 00:42:21,428
? Now you're here ?

394
00:42:23,343 --> 00:42:25,886
? May you ?

395
00:42:25,925 --> 00:42:31,259
? stay and share the joy ?

396
00:42:58,718 --> 00:43:01,261
Now that's the best thing to
cheer me up since we got here.

397
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:15,885
? Now you're here ?

398
00:43:17,343 --> 00:43:19,552
? May you ?

399
00:43:20,009 --> 00:43:27,510
? stay and share the joy ?

400
00:43:28,593 --> 00:43:29,718
Bravo.

401
00:43:37,259 --> 00:43:39,468
Good evening my friends.

402
00:43:39,842 --> 00:43:41,677
Did you think I had
forgotten you?

403
00:43:42,217 --> 00:43:44,509
- Have you everything you need?
- Everything thank you.

404
00:43:44,677 --> 00:43:46,428
We're sorry, Miss Hughes?

405
00:43:46,635 --> 00:43:49,553
She asked me to say
she's not feeling well,

406
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:50,969
it is nothing serious.

407
00:43:51,009 --> 00:43:53,301
I hope she's well enough
to travel when we leave.

408
00:43:53,883 --> 00:43:55,966
Mr. Chang, I have
some questions?

409
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,217
Please, ask them.

410
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,344
We all wish to return to
civilization as soon as possible.

411
00:44:00,384 --> 00:44:03,344
Are you so certain you
are away from it?

412
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:10,760
Mr. Chang, I think I speak
for all of us, when I say

413
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,677
your hospitality is quite
remarkable and we're very grateful.

414
00:44:13,842 --> 00:44:16,760
But were also anxious to
go home as soon as we can.

415
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,885
That is always the
case Mr. Conway.

416
00:44:19,134 --> 00:44:23,052
And even more urgent, for some
of us, is to send cables.

417
00:44:23,259 --> 00:44:25,010
Unfortunately,

418
00:44:25,426 --> 00:44:28,635
we lack radio communication
of any sort.

419
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,885
It has always been a
source of deep regret,

420
00:44:31,925 --> 00:44:35,175
that the same mountains that
allow us our splendid weather,

421
00:44:35,426 --> 00:44:38,303
also prevent adequate
wireless reception.

422
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:41,094
Then perhaps you could send porter's
or messengers or some sort.

423
00:44:41,134 --> 00:44:43,011
But I'd really like to
tell my agent I'm safe.

424
00:44:43,009 --> 00:44:44,927
He's bound to have
some bookings for me.

425
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:47,426
We have no porter's
or messengers.

426
00:44:47,593 --> 00:44:48,635
No porter's, but…

427
00:44:48,718 --> 00:44:50,885
You were rescued
by our own people.

428
00:44:50,925 --> 00:44:53,551
Who have never gone beyond the
point of which you were found.

429
00:44:53,718 --> 00:44:56,052
Two venture further
would be too hazardous.

430
00:44:56,092 --> 00:44:57,760
How'd you get all this
stuff brought here?

431
00:44:58,677 --> 00:45:01,512
Ahh, yes.

432
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:05,634
Well, depending upon
favorable weather of course.

433
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:07,634
There are porters,

434
00:45:07,842 --> 00:45:11,176
500 miles away who sometimes
make the journey.

435
00:45:11,718 --> 00:45:14,428
They are our only contact
with what you would call,

436
00:45:14,468 --> 00:45:16,136
the outside world.

437
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,261
How soon can we get
in touch with them?

438
00:45:18,343 --> 00:45:20,677
In that respect you are
exceedingly fortunate.

439
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:24,677
We are expecting a shipment
from them at almost any moment.

440
00:45:25,384 --> 00:45:28,261
And when is "almost any
moment" Mr. Chang.

441
00:45:28,301 --> 00:45:29,760
Tomorrow, next week?

442
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,094
I cannot forecast the
exact date, precisely.

443
00:45:33,842 --> 00:45:36,343
Let me see, I believe…

444
00:45:37,259 --> 00:45:40,259
Aww, yes we have been expecting
this particular shipment,

445
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:41,760
for about two years.

446
00:45:43,134 --> 00:45:45,885
But I assure you gentlemen, I
shall endeavor to make your stay

447
00:45:45,925 --> 00:45:47,760
here as pleasant as possible.

448
00:45:48,842 --> 00:45:52,218
And now, if you'll excuse
me, it is getting late.

449
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,760
I hope you will all sleep well.

450
00:45:55,551 --> 00:45:57,593
- Good night.
- Good night.

451
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:03,844
Goodnight Mr. Conway.

452
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,967
Goodnight sir.

453
00:46:23,092 --> 00:46:24,217
About two years.

454
00:46:26,301 --> 00:46:28,219
Did you believe all that
stuff about the porters?

455
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,843
I don't know.

456
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:32,801
- Don't you care?
- Not really.

457
00:46:32,842 --> 00:46:35,301
It's nice to be in a place
where time doesn't matter.

458
00:46:35,343 --> 00:46:37,886
Yes, but you wanna get
out of here, don't you?

459
00:46:37,925 --> 00:46:39,301
I don't know what I want.

460
00:46:40,593 --> 00:46:43,802
George, something
happen when I arrived.

461
00:46:45,426 --> 00:46:47,760
Did you ever go to a
totally strange place

462
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,510
and feel from the very first moment
that you'd been there before?

463
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:52,136
Because that's what
happened to me.

464
00:46:53,635 --> 00:46:55,345
It's absurd I know.

465
00:46:56,176 --> 00:46:58,053
The feeling so strong that…

466
00:46:58,384 --> 00:47:00,135
I can't think of anything else.

467
00:47:01,967 --> 00:47:06,217
I've always in the past, wanted
to see what it was all about.

468
00:47:06,883 --> 00:47:09,300
To see what was on the other
side of the mountain.

469
00:47:10,925 --> 00:47:12,426
Perhaps this is it.

470
00:47:14,217 --> 00:47:15,843
It's like…

471
00:47:16,677 --> 00:47:17,428
coming home.

472
00:47:18,259 --> 00:47:22,509
Well with me, it's the complete reverse.
I can't wait to get back.

473
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:25,301
But I'll tell you want.

474
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:28,969
If I, mind my manners and
don't rock the boat,

475
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:32,011
will you seriously think about
getting out of here, soon.

476
00:47:32,925 --> 00:47:34,843
All right, we'll have a truce.

477
00:47:35,134 --> 00:47:36,677
Till we find out
about this place.

478
00:47:37,217 --> 00:47:38,634
And then if we get out here...

479
00:47:38,677 --> 00:47:39,470
If?

480
00:47:40,842 --> 00:47:42,092
Did I say if?

481
00:47:42,468 --> 00:47:43,885
Yes, you did.

482
00:47:48,593 --> 00:47:50,219
Can I ask you a question?

483
00:47:50,384 --> 00:47:51,968
Were we brought here on purpose?

484
00:47:52,092 --> 00:47:54,259
Over 2000 people
live in the valley.

485
00:47:54,259 --> 00:47:55,468
And if so, what is the purpose.

486
00:47:55,468 --> 00:47:57,551
In addition to those
here in Shangri-La…

487
00:47:57,635 --> 00:47:59,094
What is Shangri-La?

488
00:47:59,134 --> 00:48:00,718
Who is he? You.

489
00:48:00,967 --> 00:48:02,384
Good heavens, no.

490
00:48:02,384 --> 00:48:03,219
Not I.

491
00:48:03,426 --> 00:48:05,136
Well who, for instance.

492
00:48:05,635 --> 00:48:07,802
In time, you will know.

493
00:48:08,551 --> 00:48:10,718
You know for a man who
talks a great deal,

494
00:48:10,718 --> 00:48:13,135
it's amazing how
unenlightening you can be.

495
00:48:13,301 --> 00:48:16,011
There are some things
my dear Conway,

496
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:19,342
that I deeply regret
I cannot discuss.

497
00:48:20,176 --> 00:48:21,468
Shall we continue?

498
00:48:27,967 --> 00:48:30,718
You know, in the outside
world, you'd be a knockout.

499
00:48:31,677 --> 00:48:33,886
I bet people would fight
to see you dance.

500
00:48:34,259 --> 00:48:36,635
I fear I shall never see
you're outside world.

501
00:48:36,925 --> 00:48:39,676
Never see it? Why ever not?

502
00:48:41,217 --> 00:48:42,551
It is not possible.

503
00:48:46,426 --> 00:48:49,802
Am I then, in some way
on trial dear Mr. Chang.

504
00:48:49,842 --> 00:48:52,009
Oh no, like everyone else

505
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:54,259
you are on a pilgrimage
through life.

506
00:48:54,593 --> 00:48:59,010
By chance, out of your voyage
of discovery, is here.

507
00:49:00,092 --> 00:49:01,134
By chance?

508
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:04,552
Here of course, we have
more time for reflection.

509
00:49:04,593 --> 00:49:06,261
Sickness is unknown.

510
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,387
Perfect health is the rule.

511
00:49:08,925 --> 00:49:12,718
And it is quite common for us
to live to a very ripe old age.

512
00:49:13,343 --> 00:49:14,011
Indeed.

513
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:17,676
And does that also apply to those who
come here from the outside world.

514
00:49:17,718 --> 00:49:20,843
If it did not, Shangri-La
would never have been built.

515
00:49:36,301 --> 00:49:38,301
How old it is your
oldest inhabitants?

516
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:41,094
Um? Let me see?

517
00:49:41,384 --> 00:49:43,968
Considerably over 100 years old.

518
00:49:44,259 --> 00:49:45,136
Considerably.

519
00:49:45,925 --> 00:49:47,509
Yes, still at work,

520
00:49:47,593 --> 00:49:49,303
when last I spoke to him.

521
00:49:49,842 --> 00:49:54,218
Climate and diet, these are important
of course to keep you young.

522
00:49:54,468 --> 00:49:58,386
But we believe it is the lack
of struggle in our way of life.

523
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,678
How often in your countries
do you hear the expression,

524
00:50:01,718 --> 00:50:04,261
"He worried himself to death."

525
00:50:04,259 --> 00:50:07,468
or " this thing or that
thing killed him."

526
00:50:07,677 --> 00:50:10,094
Your lives are, as
a rule shorter.

527
00:50:10,301 --> 00:50:12,635
Not so much by natural death

528
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:14,303
as by indirect suicide.

529
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,470
Unfortunately true.

530
00:50:16,967 --> 00:50:20,092
"Climate, diet, and
harmony." you said.

531
00:50:20,259 --> 00:50:22,718
And somewhere the guiding mind.
Is that it?

532
00:50:23,176 --> 00:50:24,510
Is it not enough?

533
00:50:26,176 --> 00:50:28,510
What worries me is that
it's a little like a dream,

534
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:31,676
from which I shall shorty,
but unpleasantly, awake.

535
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,176
You surprised me.

536
00:50:34,009 --> 00:50:35,259
I surprised you?

537
00:50:35,301 --> 00:50:39,261
Yes, as you who have written
so much of better worlds

538
00:50:39,343 --> 00:50:41,635
should think it a dream
when you find one.

539
00:50:42,426 --> 00:50:46,136
Or is it that you fail to recognize one
of your own dreams when you see it.

540
00:50:48,134 --> 00:50:49,844
And this is our school.

541
00:50:51,551 --> 00:50:55,219
This is where we start to prepare
our young for the future.

542
00:50:55,259 --> 00:50:59,551
Why. Why. Why. Why. Why. Why.

543
00:50:59,593 --> 00:51:02,969
? The world is a circle
without a beginning ?

544
00:51:03,009 --> 00:51:06,092
? And nobody knows where
it really ends. ?

545
00:51:08,301 --> 00:51:14,885
? Everything depends
on where you ?

546
00:51:15,217 --> 00:51:18,426
? Are in the circle
that never begins, ?

547
00:51:18,718 --> 00:51:22,636
? Nobody knows where
the circle ends. ?

548
00:51:22,677 --> 00:51:28,886
? La la la, la la-la la, la la. ?

549
00:51:29,426 --> 00:51:32,969
? And just because you
think you're small, ?

550
00:51:33,301 --> 00:51:36,343
? That doesn't mean that
you're small at all. ?

551
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,844
? And just the way
a tiny branch ?

552
00:51:39,883 --> 00:51:43,718
? is like a tree to a twig, ?

553
00:51:45,301 --> 00:51:49,343
? To someone else you are big. ?

554
00:51:50,134 --> 00:51:53,510
? The world is a circle
without a beginning, ?

555
00:51:53,551 --> 00:51:56,718
? And nobody knows where
it really ends. ?

556
00:51:58,009 --> 00:51:58,969
? Woooa! ?

557
00:51:59,009 --> 00:52:05,510
? Everything depends
on where you ?

558
00:52:05,677 --> 00:52:08,844
? Are in the circle
that's spinning around. ?

559
00:52:09,009 --> 00:52:12,176
? Half of the time we
are upside down. ?

560
00:52:12,217 --> 00:52:18,760
? La-la-la
La la la, la la-la la, la la. ?

561
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,177
? And just because they
say you're weak, ?

562
00:52:23,259 --> 00:52:26,676
? That doesn't mean
you've a weak physique. ?

563
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,094
? And even if they're
partly right, ?

564
00:52:30,426 --> 00:52:34,509
? At least they're
partially wrong. ?

565
00:52:35,635 --> 00:52:39,345
? To someone else
you are strong. ?

566
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:14,344
? And just because they
say you're slow, ?

567
00:53:14,718 --> 00:53:17,801
? That doesn't mean that
you're slow, you know. ?

568
00:53:17,967 --> 00:53:21,343
? And even if you're
never first, ?

569
00:53:21,468 --> 00:53:25,593
? Compared to someone
who's last, ?

570
00:53:26,883 --> 00:53:31,133
? They're sure to
think you are fast. ?

571
00:53:35,426 --> 00:53:40,843
? The world is a circle
without a beginning, ?

572
00:53:40,883 --> 00:53:43,925
? And nobody knows where
it really ends. ?

573
00:53:45,217 --> 00:53:46,052
? Woooa! ?

574
00:53:46,092 --> 00:53:52,760
? Everything depends
on where you ?

575
00:53:52,925 --> 00:53:56,217
? Are in the circle
that never begins. ?

576
00:53:56,343 --> 00:53:59,220
? Nobody knows where
the circle ends. ?

577
00:53:59,259 --> 00:54:05,301
? La-la-la
La la la, la la-la la. ?

578
00:54:05,384 --> 00:54:08,760
? The world is a circle
that never begins. ?

579
00:54:09,009 --> 00:54:15,886
? Nobody knows where
the circle ends. ?

580
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:25,760
- Oh.
- Children.

581
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,802
Thank you.

582
00:54:35,134 --> 00:54:39,551
Sometime in the future, you shall
have the pleasure of meeting her.

583
00:54:54,635 --> 00:54:57,677
Sam, Sam I had the strangest
dream last night.

584
00:54:58,009 --> 00:55:00,259
I dreamt I swallowed a
50 pound marshmallow.

585
00:55:00,468 --> 00:55:01,969
And when I woke up
my pillow was gone.

586
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:05,134
- You're getting better.
- I thought so.

587
00:55:05,384 --> 00:55:07,843
- You go on. I'll be with you in a minute.
- OK, hurry it up.

588
00:55:16,426 --> 00:55:18,136
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
you were alone.

589
00:55:18,259 --> 00:55:18,927
What is it?

590
00:55:19,343 --> 00:55:21,303
Lovett had a deck of cards.
I thought you'd...

591
00:55:21,301 --> 00:55:22,635
might like to play a game.

592
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,010
Some other time, huh?

593
00:55:29,134 --> 00:55:30,052
Sure.

594
00:55:38,384 --> 00:55:40,384
I didn't think I
could hold a card.

595
00:55:41,718 --> 00:55:43,219
Why am I like this?

596
00:55:47,301 --> 00:55:49,094
It helps talking to you.

597
00:55:50,259 --> 00:55:53,177
My little cold knot in my
stomach starts easing up.

598
00:55:54,426 --> 00:55:55,386
My memory

599
00:55:56,343 --> 00:55:57,886
keeps coming back, that I…

600
00:55:58,092 --> 00:56:00,468
really considered dropping
off this balcony.

601
00:56:01,134 --> 00:56:02,844
Would you have done so?

602
00:56:03,842 --> 00:56:04,884
I don't know.

603
00:56:06,259 --> 00:56:08,342
If Chang hadn't called,
then maybe I would.

604
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:10,802
That's what frightens me.

605
00:56:12,259 --> 00:56:13,635
What's happened to me?

606
00:56:14,343 --> 00:56:16,385
Perhaps you can
answer that yourself.

607
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:20,884
Sally, "Golden Girl."

608
00:56:21,883 --> 00:56:24,426
I was always taught,
dreams could come true.

609
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:28,844
That's terrific to believe
when you're a kid.

610
00:56:29,343 --> 00:56:32,343
A little more difficult later on when
you're a "little more difficult."

611
00:56:32,925 --> 00:56:35,175
All that passionate involvement.

612
00:56:35,217 --> 00:56:36,718
Men, causes.

613
00:56:37,217 --> 00:56:40,593
Going around agonizing about
man's inhumanity to man.

614
00:56:40,635 --> 00:56:43,885
I made a good living out of taking pictures
of people with their heads blown off.

615
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,133
So other people with
their heads still on

616
00:56:46,134 --> 00:56:47,343
and usually under hair dryers

617
00:56:47,343 --> 00:56:50,802
could get a kick out of them before
turning to the nearest recipe.

618
00:56:52,301 --> 00:56:53,844
One day it all made me sick.

619
00:56:55,217 --> 00:56:56,927
The dreams were over.

620
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,261
That is very painful but,

621
00:56:59,301 --> 00:57:02,219
also necessary so that you
may take the next step.

622
00:57:02,343 --> 00:57:06,343
The next step was to start taking
pills to get the dreams back.

623
00:57:06,343 --> 00:57:09,593
The excitement, the loving,
the feeling good ones.

624
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:13,219
The kicks I got, lasted about
two and a half minutes.

625
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,925
So you find out, that's
not the answer either.

626
00:57:16,593 --> 00:57:17,718
And now?

627
00:57:21,009 --> 00:57:22,051
Nothing.

628
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:25,384
- The end of the line.
- No!

629
00:57:26,343 --> 00:57:29,053
You had the courage,
not to jump.

630
00:57:29,134 --> 00:57:30,176
Which means?

631
00:57:31,009 --> 00:57:31,927
You must tell me.

632
00:57:31,967 --> 00:57:33,009
Answers!

633
00:57:33,009 --> 00:57:35,301
Where the hell are any answers!
I don't know!

634
00:57:35,426 --> 00:57:37,509
Try Miss. Hughes.

635
00:57:40,468 --> 00:57:42,885
Inside me I guess. Is that it?

636
00:57:44,677 --> 00:57:47,345
It would not be wrong
to start there.

637
00:57:54,925 --> 00:57:58,217
- May I help you with some tea Mr. Conway?
- Thank you.

638
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:04,551
Let me see. 19 plus 187
gives me a grand total of…

639
00:58:05,468 --> 00:58:07,510
two hundred and six.

640
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:09,593
You know if you hadn't told
me you were honest Harry,

641
00:58:09,593 --> 00:58:10,843
I'd swear you were cheating.

642
00:58:10,883 --> 00:58:12,634
Of course I'm cheating Sampson,
and getting away with it.

643
00:58:12,635 --> 00:58:14,595
I mean there's no fun
playing cards if you don't.

644
00:58:21,009 --> 00:58:24,969
And the rest of us, are we all
as content as we seem here or…

645
00:58:25,176 --> 00:58:28,053
is there some delicious
drug in our food?

646
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,136
Or is all this, a mirage?

647
00:58:31,176 --> 00:58:36,218
No, no no no my dear Mr. Conway, we
employ no such methods in Shangri-La.

648
00:58:36,677 --> 00:58:38,927
To put it simply, we
believe in moderation.

649
00:58:39,343 --> 00:58:42,635
We teach that virtue
lies in avoiding excess.

650
00:58:43,301 --> 00:58:45,760
We rule with moderates
strictness.

651
00:58:45,925 --> 00:58:50,050
In return we are satisfied
with moderate obedience.

652
00:58:50,301 --> 00:58:53,343
As a result our people
are moderately sober.

653
00:58:53,426 --> 00:58:58,593
Moderately chase and err...
moderately honest.

654
00:58:59,176 --> 00:59:01,969
Then you're more than
moderately fortunate.

655
00:59:05,009 --> 00:59:06,426
Good evening.

656
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:10,760
Good evening.

657
00:59:12,677 --> 00:59:14,428
Well, I brought you this.

658
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:16,551
Oh, thank you.

659
00:59:16,635 --> 00:59:18,219
- May I look at it?
- Yes.

660
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,136
Do you ever have
arguments over women?

661
00:59:22,551 --> 00:59:25,927
Oh, only very rarely.

662
00:59:26,551 --> 00:59:28,927
You see, it would not be
considered good manners

663
00:59:28,967 --> 00:59:31,426
to take a woman that
another man wanted.

664
00:59:31,883 --> 00:59:34,718
And supposing somebody wanted
some particular woman so badly,

665
00:59:34,718 --> 00:59:36,885
he didn't care whether it
was good manners or not.

666
00:59:36,925 --> 00:59:38,342
Well in that event.

667
00:59:38,343 --> 00:59:41,011
It would be good manners on
the part of the other man...

668
00:59:41,092 --> 00:59:42,509
To eh…

669
00:59:42,842 --> 00:59:44,259
Yes?

670
00:59:44,593 --> 00:59:46,094
To let him have her.

671
00:59:47,217 --> 00:59:50,676
That's very convenient.
I think I like that.

672
00:59:51,259 --> 00:59:54,468
And ah, does this arrangement
applied for women also?

673
00:59:54,635 --> 00:59:59,261
Of course. You'd be surprised Mr. Conway
how a little courtesy all around

674
00:59:59,384 --> 01:00:03,261
can help to smooth out the
most complicated problems.

675
01:00:03,301 --> 01:00:04,677
Thank you.

676
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,593
- Hope it has a happy ending.
- Good night.

677
01:00:06,593 --> 01:00:08,136
- Good night.
- Good night.

678
01:00:11,134 --> 01:00:12,969
Excuse me.

679
01:00:17,259 --> 01:00:18,802
Just a minute.

680
01:00:20,593 --> 01:00:22,344
Yes Mr. Conway.

681
01:00:26,718 --> 01:00:29,511
I'm… in a quandary and ah…

682
01:00:29,635 --> 01:00:31,261
I thought that…

683
01:00:31,677 --> 01:00:33,595
you might be able to help me.

684
01:00:33,677 --> 01:00:37,637
I noticed you are having your
course in elementary Chang.

685
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:40,302
What is your problem?

686
01:00:40,468 --> 01:00:43,428
Well, Chang tells me that as
soon as I meet a woman I like

687
01:00:43,551 --> 01:00:46,386
I must be prepared to give her up
if somebody else likes her as well

688
01:00:46,426 --> 01:00:48,969
and I don't think I'm
capable of doing that.

689
01:00:49,551 --> 01:00:52,469
- When that happens…
- I think it has.

690
01:00:53,134 --> 01:00:55,635
When that happens
the important thing

691
01:00:55,677 --> 01:01:00,303
is to try and make the… other fellow,
the one who must be courteous.

692
01:01:00,384 --> 01:01:02,384
I see, I hadn't thought
of it like that.

693
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:06,552
Perhaps you could help me
with some other questions.

694
01:01:06,593 --> 01:01:09,219
I have so many I hardly
know where to begin.

695
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:13,470
You want to know who I am
and what I'm doing here.

696
01:01:14,217 --> 01:01:17,968
- My name is Catherine and I was born here.
- Were you?

697
01:01:18,092 --> 01:01:21,593
Well, almost born here. It
was just beyond the pass.

698
01:01:21,635 --> 01:01:26,635
My parents were explorers who couldn't
rest until they had seen everything.

699
01:01:28,925 --> 01:01:32,509
Unfortunately, they died
just on the other side.

700
01:01:32,635 --> 01:01:34,219
And Chang rescued you.

701
01:01:34,259 --> 01:01:37,509
Fateful Chang, he and his
men found me barely alive.

702
01:01:37,925 --> 01:01:40,217
Here I've grown up and
here I've been happy.

703
01:01:40,384 --> 01:01:41,801
With no desire to leave.

704
01:01:43,134 --> 01:01:44,718
Absolutely none.

705
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:48,217
So I should know a good
thing when I see it.

706
01:01:48,259 --> 01:01:49,593
Is that it?

707
01:01:50,092 --> 01:01:51,635
That's it.

708
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:53,718
Goodnight Mr. Conway.

709
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:35,303
Well my friends you have seen our
mountains our valley and our people.

710
01:02:36,384 --> 01:02:38,384
You've heard about our past,

711
01:02:39,259 --> 01:02:41,509
now you are seeing our future.

712
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,426
This is our Festival
Of The Family.

713
01:02:44,718 --> 01:02:50,010
A chosen couple perform a ritual,
honoring the newly born children.

714
01:02:51,176 --> 01:02:55,802
? Start with a man
and you have one ?

715
01:02:55,842 --> 01:03:02,051
? Add on a woman and
then you have two. ?

716
01:03:02,134 --> 01:03:08,718
? Add on a child and
what have you got? ?

717
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,511
? You've got more than three. ?

718
01:03:13,718 --> 01:03:19,678
? You have what they
call a family. ?

719
01:03:19,842 --> 01:03:27,426
? Living Together, Growing
Together, just being together, ?

720
01:03:27,677 --> 01:03:30,136
? that's how it starts. ?

721
01:03:30,259 --> 01:03:34,468
? Three loving hearts all ?

722
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:42,136
? pulling together, working
together, just building together, ?

723
01:03:42,343 --> 01:03:44,969
? that makes you strong. ?

724
01:03:45,134 --> 01:03:53,134
? If things go wrong we'll
still get along somehow, ?

725
01:03:55,468 --> 01:04:02,551
? living and growing together. ?

726
01:04:03,718 --> 01:04:07,760
? It just takes wood
to build a house. ?

727
01:04:07,883 --> 01:04:13,509
? Fill it with people
and you have a home. ?

728
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:19,552
? Fill it with love and
people take root. ?

729
01:04:20,259 --> 01:04:23,676
? It's just like a tree ?

730
01:04:23,967 --> 01:04:29,510
? where each branch
becomes a family that's ?

731
01:04:29,551 --> 01:04:36,968
? Living Together, Growing
Together, just being together, ?

732
01:04:37,217 --> 01:04:39,760
? that's how it starts. ?

733
01:04:39,883 --> 01:04:44,008
? Three loving hearts all ?

734
01:04:44,176 --> 01:04:51,719
? pulling together, working
together, just building together, ?

735
01:04:52,009 --> 01:04:54,468
? that makes you strong. ?

736
01:04:54,677 --> 01:04:58,802
? If things go wrong we'll ?

737
01:04:58,883 --> 01:05:03,593
? still get along somehow, ?

738
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:11,635
? living and growing together. ?

739
01:05:13,426 --> 01:05:21,426
? Living Together, Growing
Together, just being together, ?

740
01:05:21,883 --> 01:05:24,467
? that's how it starts. ?

741
01:05:24,718 --> 01:05:29,094
? Three loving hearts all ?

742
01:05:29,176 --> 01:05:37,094
? pulling together, working
together, just building together, ?

743
01:05:37,217 --> 01:05:39,968
? that makes you strong. ?

744
01:05:40,092 --> 01:05:48,802
? If things go wrong we'll
still get along somehow, ?

745
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:55,177
? living and growing ?

746
01:05:55,343 --> 01:06:08,220
? just like we're doing
now, together. ?

747
01:10:00,393 --> 01:10:01,936
Yeaahhh!!

748
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:31,975
? Seems like I've had
so little time. ?

749
01:10:32,184 --> 01:10:35,643
? All through my life ?

750
01:10:36,226 --> 01:10:40,435
? Maybe that's why
I've always been ?

751
01:10:40,809 --> 01:10:43,477
? so impatient. ?

752
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,977
? I must learn to be patient ?

753
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:53,477
? or I might frighten her away. ?

754
01:10:53,518 --> 01:10:57,436
? Seems like I've had
just too much time ?

755
01:10:57,477 --> 01:11:00,644
? All through my life ?

756
01:11:01,725 --> 01:11:05,643
? Maybe that’s why
I’ve seemed to be ?

757
01:11:05,934 --> 01:11:13,435
? So unhurried, somethings
just should be hurried ?

758
01:11:13,725 --> 01:11:18,725
? Or they might
frighten him away ?

759
01:11:18,725 --> 01:11:22,393
? Seemed like were part
of two different world ?

760
01:11:22,393 --> 01:11:24,769
? In the way we live ?

761
01:11:24,809 --> 01:11:29,185
? More than in just
a few things ?

762
01:11:29,226 --> 01:11:33,351
? that mean we both
a lot to give ?

763
01:11:33,435 --> 01:11:37,644
? Learning how we do things ?

764
01:11:37,683 --> 01:11:44,393
? Sharing new things ?

765
01:11:44,393 --> 01:11:50,476
? Looking back I see that
I’ve always been alone ?

766
01:11:50,683 --> 01:11:54,267
? All through my life ?

767
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:59,059
? Maybe I knew
when it was time ?

768
01:11:59,226 --> 01:12:02,226
? Love would find me ?

769
01:12:02,809 --> 01:12:06,851
? I must just let it find me ?

770
01:12:06,892 --> 01:12:13,810
? Or it might
frighten her away ?

771
01:12:14,809 --> 01:12:22,809
? Yes it might
frighten him away ?

772
01:12:24,059 --> 01:12:27,936
? If we rush we may loose ?

773
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:31,769
? What we may have found ?

774
01:12:31,809 --> 01:12:41,226
? today. ?

775
01:12:41,725 --> 01:12:49,725
? Mmmmh,

776
01:12:49,809 --> 01:12:57,644
Mmmmm, ?

777
01:13:02,226 --> 01:13:03,186
Hi.

778
01:13:05,184 --> 01:13:08,267
Ah, improving your
mind again eh?

779
01:13:08,642 --> 01:13:09,809
You should try it.

780
01:13:10,017 --> 01:13:11,059
Yes.

781
01:13:11,477 --> 01:13:12,936
Yes, maybe you're right.

782
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,809
Then perhaps I can
understand what it is

783
01:13:15,809 --> 01:13:18,352
about this place that the rest
of you seem to enjoy so much.

784
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,642
Tell me, don't you ever give
a thought to leaving here?

785
01:13:21,642 --> 01:13:24,310
No. I don’t know
what you left behind

786
01:13:24,351 --> 01:13:26,768
but what I left behind, I'm not
in such a hurry to see again.

787
01:13:26,767 --> 01:13:27,560
Aw.

788
01:13:27,809 --> 01:13:29,560
Don't listen to her Maria.

789
01:13:29,642 --> 01:13:32,185
She was born to be a recluse.

790
01:13:35,892 --> 01:13:39,769
Hello Maria. I saw you dance at the
ceremony, and you were lovely.

791
01:13:39,809 --> 01:13:40,644
Thank you.

792
01:13:40,683 --> 01:13:42,393
I've read these and I've
come back for more.

793
01:13:42,477 --> 01:13:45,395
I wonder what will happen
when we've read them all.

794
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:48,353
We'll be about 250 and
need new glasses.

795
01:13:49,310 --> 01:13:51,811
You sound like you hate
the outside world.

796
01:13:51,934 --> 01:13:54,435
- Do you?
- Well I don't love it.

797
01:13:54,683 --> 01:13:57,393
But what about London and Paris?

798
01:13:57,393 --> 01:14:00,061
And the Greek islands and
the Leningrad Ballet.

799
01:14:00,101 --> 01:14:03,518
You mean compared to hear? Oh,
Maria you must be kidding.

800
01:14:03,892 --> 01:14:07,560
Look what you got, plus all the
time the world to enjoy it.

801
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:11,811
Time, … Yes there is time.

802
01:14:12,934 --> 01:14:18,310
Before George came, it didn't seem
strange to spend my days in reading.

803
01:14:18,393 --> 01:14:20,852
Talk to myself, dance.

804
01:14:21,351 --> 01:14:24,768
Drift through the days full of
nothing but peace and quiet.

805
01:14:25,976 --> 01:14:29,268
It didn't seem too long,
but it's different now.

806
01:14:29,351 --> 01:14:33,019
Oh boy, good old George.

807
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:37,602
Take it from me Maria, Shangri-La has
a definite edge over New York City,

808
01:14:37,642 --> 01:14:39,477
not to mention
Calcutta and the rest.

809
01:14:39,518 --> 01:14:41,518
But the way George describes it.

810
01:14:41,518 --> 01:14:44,977
Listen Marie, George is a nice guy
and I don't mean to knock him,

811
01:14:45,017 --> 01:14:47,977
but don't let him kid you there's
some sort of wonderland outside.

812
01:14:48,435 --> 01:14:51,644
So all you have is
peace and quiet uh-uh.

813
01:14:51,725 --> 01:14:53,808
You have a place here
where you can breathe.

814
01:14:53,809 --> 01:14:56,018
Where no violence, no cruelty.

815
01:14:56,351 --> 01:14:58,643
A place where people will
take the time to care.

816
01:14:59,477 --> 01:15:02,437
George can have his rat race.
I can do without it.

817
01:15:04,017 --> 01:15:06,935
? On the list of the things
that I will not miss ?

818
01:15:06,976 --> 01:15:08,602
? First of all is noise ?

819
01:15:10,351 --> 01:15:15,560
? On the list of the things
that I will not miss ?

820
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:17,144
? Is peace and quiet ?

821
01:15:17,184 --> 01:15:20,019
? I would like to try it ?

822
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,933
? Different people look at life
from different points of view ?

823
01:15:24,934 --> 01:15:31,059
? If you really want the things
I have just help yourself ?

824
01:15:31,268 --> 01:15:33,061
? I give it all to you ?

825
01:15:33,101 --> 01:15:35,602
? On the list of the things
that I will not miss ?

826
01:15:35,683 --> 01:15:37,309
? I would mention crowds ?

827
01:15:39,226 --> 01:15:44,103
? On the list of the things
that I will not miss ?

828
01:15:44,143 --> 01:15:45,894
? Is open spaces ?

829
01:15:45,934 --> 01:15:48,727
? Why can't we change places? ?

830
01:15:50,725 --> 01:15:53,518
? Different people look at life
from different points of view ?

831
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:59,769
? If you really want the things
I have just help yourself ?

832
01:15:59,809 --> 01:16:01,809
? I give it all to you ?

833
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:04,309
? On the list of the things
that I will not miss ?

834
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:05,811
? I would mention work ?

835
01:16:07,767 --> 01:16:12,976
? On the list of the things
that I will not miss ?

836
01:16:12,976 --> 01:16:14,602
? Is contemplation ?

837
01:16:14,642 --> 01:16:17,101
? Sounds like a great vacation ?

838
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:22,393
? Different people look at life
from different points of view ?

839
01:16:22,435 --> 01:16:28,518
? If you really want the things
I have just help yourself ?

840
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,395
? I give it all to you ?

841
01:16:47,642 --> 01:16:50,393
? Different people look at life
from different points of view ?

842
01:16:50,435 --> 01:16:56,560
? If you really want the things
I have just help yourself ?

843
01:16:56,767 --> 01:16:58,518
? I give it all to you ?

844
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,061
? On the list of the things
that I will not miss ?

845
01:17:01,101 --> 01:17:02,936
? Most of all is rain ?

846
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:09,395
? On the list of the things
that I will not miss ?

847
01:17:09,435 --> 01:17:11,685
? Is too much sunshine ?

848
01:17:11,725 --> 01:17:13,975
? Can there be too
much sunshine? ?

849
01:17:16,143 --> 01:17:19,143
? Different people look at life
from different points of view ?

850
01:17:45,017 --> 01:17:47,935
? Different people look at life
from different points of view ?

851
01:17:48,059 --> 01:17:53,685
? If you really want the things
I have just help yourself ?

852
01:17:53,725 --> 01:17:57,476
? They're yours ?

853
01:17:57,518 --> 01:18:04,894
? I give it all to you ?

854
01:18:48,934 --> 01:18:52,059
You know, those girls would
be great in my new act.

855
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,643
They should be so lucky.

856
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:02,852
You look beautiful.

857
01:19:02,892 --> 01:19:04,727
Thanks. I guess.

858
01:19:04,767 --> 01:19:07,850
Oh I mean, you looked beautiful
before but now, you look beautiful.

859
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,144
Tomorrow I got
something to tell you.

860
01:19:10,184 --> 01:19:11,309
What's wrong with today?

861
01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:13,103
I can't now, it's a secret.

862
01:19:16,767 --> 01:19:18,101
Alright.

863
01:19:27,435 --> 01:19:29,061
I'm afraid that truces over.

864
01:19:29,226 --> 01:19:30,351
Why?

865
01:19:30,435 --> 01:19:32,435
If we don't get it straight
now we never will.

866
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:33,602
Get what straight?

867
01:19:33,642 --> 01:19:36,767
Who wants to leave,
and when and how.

868
01:19:37,059 --> 01:19:39,101
For start, I want you to
tell them what you told me.

869
01:19:39,101 --> 01:19:40,435
That we were brought
here deliberately.

870
01:19:40,435 --> 01:19:42,270
And what's the point.
They're perfectly happy.

871
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:44,228
They won't be when
they find out.

872
01:19:44,683 --> 01:19:45,892
Will you tell them?

873
01:19:46,351 --> 01:19:48,351
No, and certainly not tonight.

874
01:19:48,351 --> 01:19:49,518
Then I will.

875
01:19:54,642 --> 01:19:56,059
Listen everybody.

876
01:19:56,477 --> 01:19:58,312
My brother wants to
explode a small bomb but

877
01:19:58,351 --> 01:20:00,019
I think I better do it.
Sit down George.

878
01:20:00,059 --> 01:20:02,476
Do you realize that we
are all prisoners here?

879
01:20:02,477 --> 01:20:03,894
No we're not, we're guest.

880
01:20:03,934 --> 01:20:05,602
We were deliberately kidnapped.

881
01:20:05,642 --> 01:20:07,310
- What is this?
- You have no proof of that.

882
01:20:07,351 --> 01:20:09,601
The pilot of a plane was
a man from Shangri-La.

883
01:20:09,642 --> 01:20:12,809
- May have been.
- Stop glossing over the facts.

884
01:20:14,767 --> 01:20:17,602
I want to get out of here.
I can't do it alone

885
01:20:17,642 --> 01:20:20,226
I need to know if anyone
else feels as I do?

886
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:27,353
Well, does anyone
else want to leave.

887
01:20:27,683 --> 01:20:30,975
Mr. Conway? Mr. Conway.

888
01:20:31,518 --> 01:20:33,643
Ask him if you don't believe me.

889
01:20:34,767 --> 01:20:37,143
Why were we kidnapped and
brought here Mr. Chang?

890
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:39,644
Mr. Conway I'd bring you
extraordinary news.

891
01:20:39,683 --> 01:20:40,975
Answer the question.

892
01:20:40,976 --> 01:20:43,059
- Let him go. - Richard! - Let him go!

893
01:20:48,226 --> 01:20:49,268
Mr. Chang,

894
01:20:49,435 --> 01:20:51,936
Forgive my brother's determination
to force the issue.

895
01:20:51,934 --> 01:20:53,644
You've been very kind
and we appreciate it.

896
01:20:53,725 --> 01:20:56,934
But I think the time has come for
you to be more open with us.

897
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,059
Were we brought here
deliberately and if so why?

898
01:21:00,059 --> 01:21:02,685
There is no time to answer
questions now Mr. Conway.

899
01:21:02,725 --> 01:21:06,685
You must come at once. The
High Lama wishes to see you.

900
01:21:07,767 --> 01:21:09,351
Who is the High Lama?

901
01:21:09,477 --> 01:21:11,270
I thought you ran
this place Chang.

902
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:13,894
Oh no, I'm only a humbled
member of the community.

903
01:21:13,934 --> 01:21:15,852
- Please Mr. Conway, you must…
- Just a minute.

904
01:21:16,518 --> 01:21:18,768
Will your High Lama
answer our questions?

905
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:22,686
That is possible.

906
01:21:24,683 --> 01:21:26,975
Then he's the man
that I want to see.

907
01:21:30,143 --> 01:21:31,226
Richard?

908
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:35,810
Tell him that, I at least
intend to leave here.

909
01:21:44,683 --> 01:21:47,100
I was here for five years
before I was called.

910
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:49,187
You cannot appreciate
the overwhelming

911
01:21:49,226 --> 01:21:51,103
honor that has been
bestowed upon you.

912
01:21:51,143 --> 01:21:53,226
It is unprecedented.

913
01:22:32,143 --> 01:22:34,103
Good evening Mr. Conway.

914
01:22:35,101 --> 01:22:38,143
Please come in.
Sit down near me.

915
01:22:52,976 --> 01:22:58,018
I trust, you have been comfortable
at Shangri-La since you arrival.

916
01:22:58,184 --> 01:22:59,768
I've liked it very much.

917
01:23:00,725 --> 01:23:04,435
But some of my friends and in particularly
my brother are puzzled by the mystery.

918
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,061
I can understand
that Mr. Conway.

919
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:11,103
Perhaps if I told you
of Shangri-La's origins

920
01:23:11,477 --> 01:23:13,270
things would become clearer.

921
01:23:14,059 --> 01:23:15,101
Thank you.

922
01:23:15,683 --> 01:23:19,142
A Belgian priest named
Father Perrault

923
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:23,437
was was the first European to enter
the valley of the Blue Moon.

924
01:23:24,059 --> 01:23:25,184
When was that?

925
01:23:25,477 --> 01:23:29,061
Was the year 1747.

926
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:33,976
When Father Perrault tumbled into
the valley half frozen to death,

927
01:23:34,184 --> 01:23:38,601
one of his legs was
so badly frostbitten,

928
01:23:38,642 --> 01:23:43,684
there being no doctor he was
forced to amputate it himself.

929
01:23:44,351 --> 01:23:46,852
- He amputated his own leg?
- Yes.

930
01:23:47,017 --> 01:23:52,643
Oddly enough, later, when the
natives came to trust him.

931
01:23:52,892 --> 01:23:56,810
He learned from them that
his leg would have healed

932
01:23:56,850 --> 01:23:58,892
without amputation.

933
01:23:59,143 --> 01:24:01,811
- With frostbite that's impossible.
- Oh no.

934
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,017
This valley celebrates
the natural life.

935
01:24:07,892 --> 01:24:09,727
And he recovered well.

936
01:24:10,017 --> 01:24:13,059
Soon he was making his
way around the valley

937
01:24:13,059 --> 01:24:16,101
taking a great interest
in everything.

938
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:20,602
He taught his own religion
and the best of others.

939
01:24:20,725 --> 01:24:22,850
Instructing the children

940
01:24:22,976 --> 01:24:28,393
knowing how important education
would be for future generations.

941
01:24:29,268 --> 01:24:33,103
He began building the
Lamasery of Shangri-La

942
01:24:33,143 --> 01:24:35,477
with one or two helpers.

943
01:24:35,518 --> 01:24:38,810
But after some years
hundreds of the natives

944
01:24:38,850 --> 01:24:42,601
who by now had come to respect
him helped with the task.

945
01:24:44,351 --> 01:24:50,019
When it was finished
he was 108 years old.

946
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:54,103
He's life works is over.

947
01:24:55,268 --> 01:25:00,685
He became weak and lay in his room for
many weeks between life and death.

948
01:25:01,725 --> 01:25:04,476
And then a strange
thing happened.

949
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:07,642
He had a vision

950
01:25:09,518 --> 01:25:11,685
of the purpose

951
01:25:11,976 --> 01:25:15,894
of Shangri-La, of
its entire meaning.

952
01:25:16,809 --> 01:25:18,934
And of his part in it.

953
01:25:20,059 --> 01:25:24,393
From that moment on
he began to recover.

954
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,518
And how old was he when he died?

955
01:25:46,059 --> 01:25:47,727
But that's incredible!

956
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:50,560
Yes my son.

957
01:25:52,226 --> 01:25:54,518
You're still alive
Father Perrault.

958
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:58,975
Sit down my son.

959
01:26:02,767 --> 01:26:07,602
You may not know it, but I've been an
admirer of yours for a great many years.

960
01:26:08,393 --> 01:26:09,852
Of mine, Father?

961
01:26:09,892 --> 01:26:15,560
Oh, not the Richard Conway, the
public hero, the government servant

962
01:26:15,850 --> 01:26:18,768
but the Richard Conway
who once wrote,

963
01:26:19,184 --> 01:26:22,727
"There are moments
in every man's life

964
01:26:22,934 --> 01:26:27,226
when he glimpses the eternal."

965
01:26:28,059 --> 01:26:30,769
That man seemed to belong here.

966
01:26:31,017 --> 01:26:35,560
In fact, it was suggested
that someone be sent

967
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,769
to bring him here.

968
01:26:37,809 --> 01:26:40,727
So I was right, we
were brought here.

969
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:46,101
But, what possible use could I be
to an already thriving community?

970
01:26:46,101 --> 01:26:49,351
If this community is
to continue to thrive,

971
01:26:49,393 --> 01:26:52,144
then we need men like you here.

972
01:26:54,351 --> 01:26:55,894
You can work today.

973
01:26:56,767 --> 01:26:59,560
Is there anything more pitiful.

974
01:26:59,642 --> 01:27:01,684
Will surely this is
a time of crisis.

975
01:27:02,184 --> 01:27:04,476
But when has the world
known any other time.

976
01:27:05,017 --> 01:27:07,434
What madness there is

977
01:27:07,435 --> 01:27:12,145
what blindness, what
unintelligent leadership.

978
01:27:13,184 --> 01:27:18,685
A furiously harassing marshall,
bewildered, humanities, strengthening,

979
01:27:18,725 --> 01:27:22,476
not in wisdom but
in vulgar passions.

980
01:27:22,683 --> 01:27:26,892
The time must come when
evil will destroy itself.

981
01:27:28,435 --> 01:27:31,103
I will not live to see that day.

982
01:27:33,101 --> 01:27:35,310
But you might, my son.

983
01:27:36,101 --> 01:27:40,894
And that is why you have
been brought to Shangri-La.

984
01:27:41,725 --> 01:27:47,518
For when the day comes, that the
world begins to look for a new life,

985
01:27:47,725 --> 01:27:49,725
it is our belief

986
01:27:49,976 --> 01:27:54,393
that they will find a
reservoir of hope here.

987
01:27:54,850 --> 01:27:59,351
So here we shall stay with
our books and our music.

988
01:28:00,017 --> 01:28:02,017
And our medications.

989
01:28:02,892 --> 01:28:07,518
Here we shall be, to guide the
footsteps of a weary people.

990
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:11,643
Here we shall be with
our way of life.

991
01:28:12,101 --> 01:28:14,936
There's only one simple rule, …

992
01:28:16,101 --> 01:28:17,811
be kind.

993
01:28:20,892 --> 01:28:23,017
And it is our hope

994
01:28:23,435 --> 01:28:28,186
that our brotherly love will then
spread throughout the world.

995
01:28:29,850 --> 01:28:34,142
And when the strong have
devoured each other,

996
01:28:34,767 --> 01:28:37,809
then, at last…

997
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:43,727
the meek shall
inherit the earth.

998
01:28:48,767 --> 01:28:50,934
I am tired now my son.

999
01:28:56,059 --> 01:28:57,894
Will you come again?

1000
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,144
Yes I will.

1001
01:29:51,435 --> 01:29:57,228
? How do I know this is
part of my real life? ?

1002
01:30:02,184 --> 01:30:06,768
? If there's no pain can
I be sure I feel life? ?

1003
01:30:11,892 --> 01:30:24,643
? And would I go back if
I knew how to go back? ?

1004
01:30:25,767 --> 01:30:31,017
? What good is time when
you're sure of tomorrow? ?

1005
01:30:35,767 --> 01:30:40,226
? Can there be joy where
there has been no sorrow? ?

1006
01:30:45,226 --> 01:30:58,560
? And would I go back if
I knew how to go back? ?

1007
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:11,769
? Will I find there is really
such a thing as peace of mind, ?

1008
01:31:13,143 --> 01:31:17,602
? and what I thought was living
was truly just confusion, ?

1009
01:31:18,184 --> 01:31:26,226
? the chance to live forever
is really no illusion, ?

1010
01:31:26,809 --> 01:31:35,644
? and this all can be mine? ?

1011
01:31:36,017 --> 01:31:43,852
? Why can't I make
myself believe it? ?

1012
01:32:10,725 --> 01:32:15,017
? Can I accept what
I see around me? ?

1013
01:32:19,767 --> 01:32:25,644
? Have I found Shangri-La,
or has it found me? ?

1014
01:32:26,226 --> 01:32:40,144
? And would I go back if
I knew how to go back? ?

1015
01:32:40,184 --> 01:32:53,518
? Will I find there is really
such a thing as peace of mind, ?

1016
01:32:54,477 --> 01:32:59,145
? and what I thought was living
was truly just confusion, ?

1017
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:07,936
? the chance to live forever
is really no illusion, ?

1018
01:33:08,393 --> 01:33:17,560
? and this all can be mine? ?

1019
01:33:17,976 --> 01:33:26,602
? Why can't I make
myself believe it? ?

1020
01:33:49,767 --> 01:33:55,101
? There are things that you see. ?

1021
01:33:55,850 --> 01:34:00,100
? Other things you feel. ?

1022
01:34:00,809 --> 01:34:12,477
? Feelings can't be seen yet we
never doubt they are real. ?

1023
01:34:14,725 --> 01:34:25,476
? When you search for the truth
don't just use your eyes. ?

1024
01:34:25,892 --> 01:34:38,769
? Look inside yourself that is
where the truth always lies. ?

1025
01:34:40,809 --> 01:34:52,769
? Where knowledge
ends faith begins, ?

1026
01:34:53,435 --> 01:35:03,602
? and it shines like a star, ?

1027
01:35:03,892 --> 01:35:22,268
? till your heart fills
with hope and with love. ?

1028
01:35:27,809 --> 01:35:36,143
? I have looked in your heart. ?

1029
01:35:36,767 --> 01:35:43,351
? I have faith in you. ?

1030
01:35:53,934 --> 01:35:55,184
No not there.

1031
01:35:57,477 --> 01:35:59,228
I apologize for
being away so long.

1032
01:35:59,268 --> 01:36:02,145
Well, did you ask about…- What was
he like? - Richard, did you see him?

1033
01:36:03,101 --> 01:36:03,727
Yes.

1034
01:36:05,268 --> 01:36:06,393
I saw the High Lama.

1035
01:36:07,809 --> 01:36:12,059
And I haven't the answers to all of our
questions yet, but I will in time.

1036
01:36:12,809 --> 01:36:16,059
And when I do I'll tell you
exactly what the situation is.

1037
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:18,437
Particularly about going home.

1038
01:36:19,892 --> 01:36:22,226
Until then you all
have to trust me.

1039
01:36:39,642 --> 01:36:42,059
Come on, come on,

1040
01:36:42,767 --> 01:36:45,435
Oh my lord.

1041
01:36:56,809 --> 01:37:00,560
- There, gold, the stream is full of it.
- So?

1042
01:37:00,725 --> 01:37:02,767
We can smuggle it out. Get
those porters to help us.

1043
01:37:02,809 --> 01:37:05,352
Correction, you bribe the porters,
I got something better to do.

1044
01:37:05,393 --> 01:37:06,103
Such as?

1045
01:37:06,143 --> 01:37:07,978
Such as not sitting around
worrying about how to

1046
01:37:08,017 --> 01:37:09,852
spend money in a place where
money isn't any good.

1047
01:37:09,892 --> 01:37:11,975
But what about when we get out?

1048
01:37:12,143 --> 01:37:15,519
Get out, how? Sam you
gotta' be more practical.

1049
01:37:16,017 --> 01:37:18,685
Trouble with you is you haven't
got any inner resources.

1050
01:37:18,767 --> 01:37:19,976
Who hasn't? What are
you trying to tell me?

1051
01:37:20,226 --> 01:37:22,476
Your life is made up of
infinite possibilities

1052
01:37:22,477 --> 01:37:23,686
and you're not
realizing one of them.

1053
01:37:23,725 --> 01:37:25,435
- Not one.
- For instance?

1054
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:29,852
? When you look at yourself
do you like what you see? ?

1055
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:35,936
? If you like what you see, you're
the person you should be. ?

1056
01:37:35,976 --> 01:37:40,101
? 'Cause your reflection
reflects in everything you do, ?

1057
01:37:40,310 --> 01:37:46,020
? and everything you
do reflects on you. ?

1058
01:37:51,892 --> 01:37:56,351
? When you wake up each day
do you like how you feel? ?

1059
01:37:57,017 --> 01:38:02,393
? If you like how you feel,
you've got nothing to conceal. ?

1060
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:06,810
? 'Cause your reflection
reflects in everything you do, ?

1061
01:38:07,184 --> 01:38:12,727
? and everything you
do reflects on you. ?

1062
01:38:17,976 --> 01:38:24,268
? Doing something for someone else
isn't really for someone else. ?

1063
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:32,852
? It does twice as much for you as
something you do just for yourself. ?

1064
01:38:33,310 --> 01:38:37,978
? When you lay down to sleep
do you like all your dreams? ?

1065
01:38:38,393 --> 01:38:43,936
? If you like all your dreams,
life's as happy as it seems. ?

1066
01:38:43,976 --> 01:38:48,226
? 'Cause your reflection
reflects in everything you do, ?

1067
01:38:48,642 --> 01:38:54,352
? and everything you
do reflects on you. ?

1068
01:39:08,143 --> 01:39:11,894
Now you said the other night that these
farms around here need better irrigation.

1069
01:39:11,934 --> 01:39:15,310
Well you were an engineer,
go irrigate them.

1070
01:39:15,477 --> 01:39:16,936
Yea!

1071
01:39:18,809 --> 01:39:21,560
Excuse me, I was looking
for your brother.

1072
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:23,019
He's not here.

1073
01:39:27,767 --> 01:39:29,976
She seems to be quite
taken with him.

1074
01:39:30,976 --> 01:39:34,686
Let's hope that beautiful young women can
talk more sense into him than I can.

1075
01:39:35,184 --> 01:39:37,061
You spoke of her as young.

1076
01:39:37,435 --> 01:39:39,560
My dear friend I hate
to dissolution you.

1077
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:42,228
But you must not be
deceived by her appearance.

1078
01:39:42,809 --> 01:39:46,435
Our way of life has preserved
her youth and her beauty.

1079
01:39:46,976 --> 01:39:49,435
She came here when she was 20.

1080
01:39:50,767 --> 01:39:54,184
She was on her wedding journey but her
carriers lost their way in the mountains

1081
01:39:54,226 --> 01:39:57,518
and the whole party would have
perished but for meeting our people.

1082
01:39:57,725 --> 01:39:59,393
They brought her here.

1083
01:40:00,976 --> 01:40:05,059
That was many, many years ago.

1084
01:40:08,059 --> 01:40:09,309
How many?

1085
01:40:12,184 --> 01:40:15,144
You are more beautiful than
the women of Thailand.

1086
01:40:16,351 --> 01:40:19,269
More feminine than
the women of France.

1087
01:40:20,017 --> 01:40:23,059
More pliable than
the women of Japan.

1088
01:40:23,767 --> 01:40:26,226
- More…
- Stop. Stop.

1089
01:40:26,477 --> 01:40:28,936
I don't want to hear about
all these other women.

1090
01:40:28,976 --> 01:40:31,519
All I want to hear is
that, you won't leave me.

1091
01:40:31,642 --> 01:40:35,101
Oh, I adore you.

1092
01:40:37,683 --> 01:40:40,975
But, I can't stay here.

1093
01:40:42,310 --> 01:40:45,769
There's so much I want to do with
my life that, I can't do here.

1094
01:40:47,184 --> 01:40:50,935
Maria, if I could find a way,
would you come back with me?

1095
01:40:51,059 --> 01:40:53,894
- There is no way.
- Well there has to be!

1096
01:40:55,683 --> 01:40:59,059
Tomorrow I'm going out to the pass that
leads out of here, to see if its guarded.

1097
01:40:59,143 --> 01:41:02,686
And to look for those porters.
If they exist.

1098
01:41:03,725 --> 01:41:05,017
They exist.

1099
01:41:05,683 --> 01:41:06,808
They do?

1100
01:41:07,892 --> 01:41:09,685
Then why didn't you
tell me before?

1101
01:41:09,850 --> 01:41:13,059
I hoped you would become
contented, like the others.

1102
01:41:13,518 --> 01:41:16,228
Con-Contented?

1103
01:41:17,435 --> 01:41:19,145
Oh...

1104
01:41:21,184 --> 01:41:24,226
Look, I have to get out of here.

1105
01:41:25,059 --> 01:41:27,685
Please, will you come with me?

1106
01:41:28,683 --> 01:41:31,309
Would you stay with
me here if I said no?

1107
01:41:35,059 --> 01:41:36,685
Then I will come with you.

1108
01:41:52,683 --> 01:41:54,601
The water starts up in
the hills all right

1109
01:41:54,642 --> 01:41:57,018
but about halfway down it's
starts going the wrong way.

1110
01:41:57,101 --> 01:42:00,101
Now if we put a dam here and these
interconnecting bamboo pipes

1111
01:42:00,101 --> 01:42:02,936
you'd have the whole valley. You'd
have the entire mountainside.

1112
01:42:02,976 --> 01:42:06,018
And just watch that stuff grow. And no
more women carrying buckets of water.

1113
01:42:06,101 --> 01:42:08,602
- Sam you're excited.
- Yeah, yeah.

1114
01:42:08,642 --> 01:42:10,185
I guess it's been a long time.

1115
01:42:10,226 --> 01:42:12,727
- A longtime what?
- Oh, since I was so excited.

1116
01:42:12,767 --> 01:42:14,644
And involved.

1117
01:42:15,268 --> 01:42:17,393
A long time ago I used
to work the land.

1118
01:42:18,976 --> 01:42:21,894
I guess I got waylaid
somewhere along the line.

1119
01:42:22,101 --> 01:42:23,852
- What happened?
- Nothing.

1120
01:42:24,351 --> 01:42:26,643
- Come on.
- Forget it. I don't wanna talk about it.

1121
01:42:26,767 --> 01:42:29,518
Sam, I'm interested.

1122
01:42:31,351 --> 01:42:34,810
Okay, does the name Simon
Causefield mean anything to you?

1123
01:42:36,143 --> 01:42:37,644
Causefield...

1124
01:42:38,226 --> 01:42:40,602
- Yeah, didn't he…
- That's me.

1125
01:42:41,809 --> 01:42:44,851
I remember American
Consolidated Products.

1126
01:42:45,017 --> 01:42:47,852
And the thing fell apart. You
were gone and the money was too.

1127
01:42:47,892 --> 01:42:51,309
I wasn't there because there wasn't
any money! And it wasn't my fault!

1128
01:42:59,101 --> 01:43:00,894
I'd worked hard and
made a little bit.

1129
01:43:00,934 --> 01:43:02,351
That little bit became a lot.

1130
01:43:02,351 --> 01:43:04,894
So I built a corporation. It
became a lot of corporations.

1131
01:43:05,143 --> 01:43:06,352
I was a hero.

1132
01:43:06,518 --> 01:43:08,977
It was the American dream.
Everybody wanted in.

1133
01:43:09,059 --> 01:43:11,852
I did ask them to, nobody told
them to buy, they just did.

1134
01:43:12,435 --> 01:43:14,518
Overnight the balloon burst.

1135
01:43:15,809 --> 01:43:19,602
The next day I'm the biggest crook
that the country has ever seen.

1136
01:43:21,101 --> 01:43:22,393
I don't know what to do.

1137
01:43:23,683 --> 01:43:25,017
So I started running.

1138
01:43:25,683 --> 01:43:27,351
Anywhere I think that
they won't find me.

1139
01:43:27,934 --> 01:43:29,811
That's how I ended up in Baskul.

1140
01:43:30,393 --> 01:43:32,311
Maybe here the running can stop.

1141
01:43:34,518 --> 01:43:36,395
Maybe.

1142
01:43:36,934 --> 01:43:38,685
Sam…

1143
01:43:46,725 --> 01:43:49,643
I stopped running
here, you can too.

1144
01:44:31,059 --> 01:44:35,936
Il pleut, il pleut, bergère.

1145
01:44:36,477 --> 01:44:40,437
Il pleut, il pleut, bergère.

1146
01:44:40,518 --> 01:44:44,102
Look, uh-uh-uh, I-I don't
know a thing about teaching.

1147
01:44:44,143 --> 01:44:45,644
- C'mon you're going to have to…
- Mouton.

1148
01:44:45,683 --> 01:44:48,226
- Il pleut, il pleut, …
- All you have to do is to follow me.

1149
01:44:48,226 --> 01:44:50,894
Come along with me.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1150
01:44:50,934 --> 01:44:52,811
Miss Catherine has to
leave you, so I want to

1151
01:44:52,850 --> 01:44:54,685
introduce you to your
new teacher of the day.

1152
01:44:54,725 --> 01:44:56,808
Your new expert Mr. Lovett.

1153
01:44:56,976 --> 01:44:58,853
Yea.

1154
01:45:08,850 --> 01:45:13,727
Well now, there you are, here
I am, and ah, where are we?

1155
01:45:15,101 --> 01:45:17,644
Ah, success. You think
that was funny folks,

1156
01:45:17,683 --> 01:45:19,142
<i>'You ain't heard nothing yet.'</i>

1157
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,936
- Now what are you learning?
- French.

1158
01:45:24,226 --> 01:45:27,810
French. Well that lets me out.
<i>'I know nothing about French.'.</i>

1159
01:45:28,184 --> 01:45:32,267
A teacher should only teach what he knows
at all I know is ah, Show Business

1160
01:45:32,310 --> 01:45:33,477
I don't think they'd approve.

1161
01:45:33,477 --> 01:45:35,894
You know when I was a kid,
the thing that got me

1162
01:45:35,976 --> 01:45:39,769
was that every teacher I ever had, only
ask me questions and expected answers.

1163
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,600
You too? Well I'll
tell you what I think.

1164
01:45:43,725 --> 01:45:47,351
Any dummy can know the answers. It's the
smart ones that know the questions.

1165
01:45:51,809 --> 01:45:54,686
? Question me an answer
bright and clear. ?

1166
01:45:54,767 --> 01:45:58,101
? I will answer with a
question clear and bright. ?

1167
01:45:59,017 --> 01:46:01,643
? Even though your
answer may be ?

1168
01:46:01,683 --> 01:46:04,601
? wrong my question
will be right. ?

1169
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:08,437
? Question me an answer. ?

1170
01:46:09,351 --> 01:46:12,186
? Answer with a question. ?

1171
01:46:12,934 --> 01:46:15,435
? Fourteen hundred ninety two. ?

1172
01:46:15,477 --> 01:46:19,894
? What's the year that Babe Ruth
hit his sixtieth home run? ?

1173
01:46:20,226 --> 01:46:22,685
? Wellington at Waterloo. ?

1174
01:46:22,767 --> 01:46:28,059
? Who became the hero at
the battle of Bull Run? ?

1175
01:46:28,850 --> 01:46:31,476
? Learning can be lots of fun. ?

1176
01:46:31,850 --> 01:46:34,643
? Question me an answer
bright and clear. ?

1177
01:46:34,809 --> 01:46:38,477
? I will answer with a
question clear and bright. ?

1178
01:46:39,184 --> 01:46:41,810

? Midnight ride of Paul Revere. ?

1183
01:46:55,725 --> 01:47:00,226
? What's the way that Yankee
Doodle really went to town? ?

1184
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:03,019
? Cleaning up the atmosphere. ?

1185
01:47:03,059 --> 01:47:08,560
? What's the reason London
Bridge is always falling down. ?

1186
01:47:09,059 --> 01:47:12,019
? You can learn things
from a clown. ?

1187
01:47:12,143 --> 01:47:14,936
? Question me an answer
bright and clear. ?

1188
01:47:15,184 --> 01:47:18,518
? I will answer with a

1189
01:47:19,477 --> 01:47:22,103

? How did Christopher
Columbus sail upon the sea? ?

1195
01:47:40,767 --> 01:47:43,226
? Underneath the circus top. ?

1196
01:47:43,351 --> 01:47:48,434
? Where did Cleopatra get
to meet Mark Antony? ?

1197
01:47:49,435 --> 01:47:59,560
? They say knowledge
makes you free. ?

1198
01:49:34,393 --> 01:49:45,769
? They say knowledge
makes you free. ?

1199
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:50,602
? Question me an answer
if you please. ?

1200
01:49:51,017 --> 01:49:55,309

1201
01:49:56,059 --> 01:50:01,602
? Let me show you just how I
became an educated man. ?

1202
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:05,270

1203
01:50:06,477 --> 01:50:09,061

1205
01:50:32,892 --> 01:50:36,560
? question me an answer. ?

1206
01:50:55,393 --> 01:50:57,103
Harry, what are you doing?

1207
01:50:57,435 --> 01:50:59,312
You hear that? They love me!

1208
01:50:59,725 --> 01:51:00,892
They love me.

1209
01:51:06,767 --> 01:51:07,767
It's beautiful.

1210
01:51:14,809 --> 01:51:16,602
It's also inconceivable.

1211
01:51:16,892 --> 01:51:18,643
Father Perrault, his story and…

1212
01:51:19,683 --> 01:51:21,725
This place hidden away from
the rest of the world.

1213
01:51:22,059 --> 01:51:23,894
Then you come along and
confuse me even more.

1214
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:26,270
- Am I so strange?
- No you're not.

1215
01:51:26,683 --> 01:51:27,850
Nothing here is strange.

1216
01:51:28,683 --> 01:51:30,142
And that's what's so confusing.

1217
01:51:31,310 --> 01:51:33,519
I'm desperately
trying to keep my…

1218
01:51:33,767 --> 01:51:35,767
emotional feedings…

1219
01:51:36,226 --> 01:51:38,019
and my spiritual needs

1220
01:51:38,059 --> 01:51:39,810
from clobbering each
other to death.

1221
01:51:41,310 --> 01:51:42,477
You're very beautiful.

1222
01:51:43,143 --> 01:51:44,310
And very desirable.

1223
01:51:45,518 --> 01:51:47,977
But like everything else beautiful
that's happened to me here.

1224
01:51:47,976 --> 01:51:49,352
I find it remarkable that…

1225
01:51:49,683 --> 01:51:51,643
it has happened to me here

1226
01:51:52,642 --> 01:51:53,684
and not out there.

1227
01:51:55,892 --> 01:51:57,393
You know, I can't
explain it but, …

1228
01:51:58,184 --> 01:51:59,810
everything seems familiar.

1229
01:52:00,892 --> 01:52:01,685
This air, …

1230
01:52:03,143 --> 01:52:04,936
Those beautiful gardens, you,

1231
01:52:06,351 --> 01:52:07,768
This lamasery with its

1232
01:52:08,059 --> 01:52:10,518
feet rooted in a good earth
of this fertile valley.

1233
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:13,395
While its head
explores the eternal.

1234
01:52:16,059 --> 01:52:17,476
And I've been kidnapped…

1235
01:52:18,226 --> 01:52:19,685
Brought here against my will

1236
01:52:19,725 --> 01:52:21,393
which is a crime, a great crime.

1237
01:52:21,976 --> 01:52:24,519
And yet I accepted it
as, one would accept

1238
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:27,061
an act performed by
a very dear friend.

1239
01:52:28,101 --> 01:52:29,226
Can you tell me why?

1240
01:52:30,059 --> 01:52:33,810
Perhaps because you've always been a
part of Shangri-La without knowing it.

1241
01:52:34,435 --> 01:52:38,395
I'm certain there's a, wish for
Shangri-La in everyone's heart.

1242
01:52:41,351 --> 01:52:43,351
I've never seen
you're outside world

1243
01:52:43,351 --> 01:52:45,894
but I imagine it's full
of millions of people

1244
01:52:45,934 --> 01:52:49,518
who secretly wish to be in a
beautiful place like this.

1245
01:52:50,477 --> 01:52:53,270
Well if they were, it wouldn't
be beautiful for long.

1246
01:52:58,393 --> 01:53:00,228
For years I hoped
that someone like you

1247
01:53:00,268 --> 01:53:02,268
would come and share
these moments with me.

1248
01:53:03,393 --> 01:53:05,852
But now you're here you're
not as I pictured you.

1249
01:53:06,184 --> 01:53:07,144
What did you expect?

1250
01:53:07,809 --> 01:53:10,727
From your books some
uh, Saintly Hero.

1251
01:53:10,767 --> 01:53:12,184
Almost astatic.

1252
01:53:12,310 --> 01:53:14,020
And much less attractive.

1253
01:53:14,393 --> 01:53:18,228
Well, people who worship heroes must
be prepared for disillusionment.

1254
01:53:18,809 --> 01:53:20,809
But, I shall become
saintly immediately.

1255
01:53:20,892 --> 01:53:23,393
Just, to please you.

1256
01:53:24,017 --> 01:53:25,226
Did you ever think…

1257
01:53:25,934 --> 01:53:28,435
What did you expect? Or hope?

1258
01:53:29,725 --> 01:53:31,560
I imagined she'd
be just like you.

1259
01:53:36,725 --> 01:53:37,602
I come to you…

1260
01:53:38,934 --> 01:53:41,602
with all my hopes and
I bring you love.

1261
01:53:43,310 --> 01:53:44,187
I come to you…

1262
01:53:47,101 --> 01:53:50,811
All my life I searched
for something rare.

1263
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:55,144
A love that I could share.

1264
01:53:56,725 --> 01:54:04,435
? I come to you with all my
dreams and I bring you love. ?

1265
01:54:05,101 --> 01:54:07,101
? I come to you. ?

1266
01:54:09,642 --> 01:54:15,477
? There were times my
faith in life was gone, ?

1267
01:54:16,101 --> 01:54:19,310
? still I continued on. ?

1268
01:54:20,226 --> 01:54:25,476
? Those endless days
turned into years. ?

1269
01:54:25,477 --> 01:54:31,936
? They were lonely
years in many ways. ?

1270
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:45,976
? And deep inside I'm sure I always
knew I had to wait for you. ?

1271
01:54:46,767 --> 01:54:52,602
? And here you are,
my own true love. ?

1272
01:54:54,143 --> 01:55:00,268
? I come to you. ?

1273
01:55:05,984 --> 01:55:09,234
? Happy birthday to you ?

1274
01:55:09,609 --> 01:55:12,734
? Happy birthday to you ?

1275
01:55:12,943 --> 01:55:16,527
? Happy birthday dear Harry ?

1276
01:55:16,984 --> 01:55:20,777
? Happy birthday to you ?

1277
01:55:24,110 --> 01:55:26,903
Thank you. Thank you my friends.
Old friends.

1278
01:55:27,692 --> 01:55:28,775
And new friends.

1279
01:55:29,193 --> 01:55:31,777
And a special thank you to Sally
for arranging the candles.

1280
01:55:32,318 --> 01:55:33,902
Twenty one how'd you guess?

1281
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:36,402
Well, here we go.

1282
01:55:39,068 --> 01:55:40,444
Yea.

1283
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:45,111
Well, this is a pretty
happy day for me.

1284
01:55:45,235 --> 01:55:47,444
Not just because it's
my birthday but ah,

1285
01:55:48,068 --> 01:55:49,569
because I've come
to a big decision.

1286
01:55:50,483 --> 01:55:52,525
I've decided to
stay in Shangri-La.

1287
01:55:52,525 --> 01:55:53,360
If they'll have me.

1288
01:55:54,110 --> 01:55:55,235
Good that's fine.

1289
01:55:55,277 --> 01:55:57,527
Now wait a minute. Hold it.
I hope Mr. Chang

1290
01:55:58,110 --> 01:56:00,028
that you'll go along with
a great idea I've got.

1291
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:02,944
I shall be most interested
to hear it Mr. Lovett.

1292
01:56:03,901 --> 01:56:06,318
Well Mr. Chang I know
I speak for all of us

1293
01:56:07,235 --> 01:56:08,318
I say that ah…

1294
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:09,610
this place is terrific.

1295
01:56:10,277 --> 01:56:11,694
I don't worry here,

1296
01:56:12,026 --> 01:56:12,944
and I sleep well.

1297
01:56:13,817 --> 01:56:15,984
Confidentially I've had some
pretty rough times lately.

1298
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:18,278
Few bookings and audiences well…

1299
01:56:18,984 --> 01:56:21,067
They weren't throwing bread,
they sat on their hands.

1300
01:56:21,277 --> 01:56:23,277
But ah, these kids here…

1301
01:56:23,984 --> 01:56:24,861
They ah...

1302
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:26,235
They love me.

1303
01:56:26,734 --> 01:56:29,611
You know I took a little personal
inventory about 10:30 last night,

1304
01:56:29,650 --> 01:56:31,026
just before going to sleep.
And I said to myself.

1305
01:56:31,068 --> 01:56:33,028
"Harry Lovette things are going
pretty well for a change."

1306
01:56:33,068 --> 01:56:36,444
And they are, so why not go for a
run of the play contract. Right?

1307
01:56:36,734 --> 01:56:39,318
Well down in school those kids,

1308
01:56:39,483 --> 01:56:41,608
Terrific kids you
got here Mr. Chang.

1309
01:56:41,650 --> 01:56:43,692
They're very imaginative.
They keep imitating me.

1310
01:56:44,984 --> 01:56:46,610
Wanting to be like me.

1311
01:56:48,442 --> 01:56:51,152
I thought it might be a good idea
to give them a course in dramatics.

1312
01:56:51,193 --> 01:56:53,070
Teach them to sing
and dance, you know

1313
01:56:53,110 --> 01:56:54,611
sort of that, 'Big Time Stuff.'

1314
01:56:55,235 --> 01:56:58,153
But ah, would that be all
right with you Mr. Chang?

1315
01:56:59,734 --> 01:57:00,984
Can I stay?

1316
01:57:01,068 --> 01:57:04,235
Watch it Mr. Chang he's liable
to cause chaos in that school.

1317
01:57:04,235 --> 01:57:07,778
I don't think so.
We have a saying,

1318
01:57:08,068 --> 01:57:11,569
"The trees that bend a little
to the harmless breeze,

1319
01:57:11,609 --> 01:57:14,609
will later grow to
withstand the wild wind."

1320
01:57:15,692 --> 01:57:16,859
Uh?

1321
01:57:16,984 --> 01:57:20,151
We shall be most honored
to have you Mr. Lovett.

1322
01:57:20,734 --> 01:57:25,193
Oh, great great great.
Now, I'll cut the cake.

1323
01:57:25,901 --> 01:57:27,569
Chang!

1324
01:57:28,567 --> 01:57:30,650
I wanna' talk with
you Mr. Chang.

1325
01:57:31,193 --> 01:57:33,903
That famous tribe of porter's
expected for two years

1326
01:57:33,943 --> 01:57:36,193
that will take us all out of
here whenever they arrive.

1327
01:57:36,277 --> 01:57:38,736
Well, I've just discovered they
have arrived, three days ago.

1328
01:57:38,859 --> 01:57:41,402
And there was never any intention
that they should take us out of here.

1329
01:57:41,442 --> 01:57:43,193
Isn't that right Mr. Chang?

1330
01:57:46,277 --> 01:57:48,112
I'm going with them Richard.

1331
01:57:48,193 --> 01:57:50,819
As for the rest of you
well, think about it.

1332
01:57:51,901 --> 01:57:53,444
Mr. Conway.

1333
01:57:55,483 --> 01:57:57,318
My friend you must
not let him go.

1334
01:57:57,734 --> 01:57:59,943
The porters could only take
him a certain distance.

1335
01:57:59,984 --> 01:58:03,652
Beyond that is a wilderness for
which he would never get out alive.

1336
01:58:03,943 --> 01:58:05,778
You should have told me
the porters where here.

1337
01:58:05,817 --> 01:58:07,360
I could have prepared
him for this.

1338
01:58:07,525 --> 01:58:08,734
Talk to him.

1339
01:58:10,277 --> 01:58:12,820
I'll try, I don't think
he'll listen to me.

1340
01:58:12,817 --> 01:58:14,026
Richard.

1341
01:58:15,984 --> 01:58:17,318
Richard.

1342
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:23,195
Be careful. He will want
you to go with him.

1343
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:25,609
Well.

1344
01:58:27,151 --> 01:58:28,443
What shall I do Catherine?

1345
01:58:28,483 --> 01:58:30,608
Go and talk to Father Perrault.

1346
01:58:32,525 --> 01:58:34,318
Yes, I will.

1347
01:58:38,776 --> 01:58:41,402
And I need your help Father,
to stop him from leaving.

1348
01:58:43,442 --> 01:58:46,026
I am no longer able to help you.

1349
01:58:46,943 --> 01:58:49,861
The responsibility is yours.

1350
01:58:52,026 --> 01:58:53,318
My son…

1351
01:58:54,650 --> 01:58:56,276
I'm going to die.

1352
01:58:57,692 --> 01:59:00,859
I wish to place in your hands,

1353
01:59:00,901 --> 01:59:04,068
the future and destiny
of Shangri-La.

1354
01:59:05,483 --> 01:59:08,900
I knew my work was done when
I first set eyes upon you.

1355
01:59:09,776 --> 01:59:13,818
I'd been waiting for
you for a long time.

1356
01:59:13,943 --> 01:59:16,486
I've sat in this room

1357
01:59:16,650 --> 01:59:20,942
and seen the faces
of many newcomers.

1358
01:59:21,110 --> 01:59:25,028
I've looked into their eyes
and heard their voices.

1359
01:59:25,235 --> 01:59:28,444
Always in the hope
that I might find you.

1360
01:59:29,943 --> 01:59:34,861
It's not an honest task
that I bequeathed.

1361
01:59:35,110 --> 01:59:39,402
For our order knows
no rigid bonds.

1362
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:45,817
To be gentle and patient,

1363
01:59:47,151 --> 01:59:51,568
to care for the
riches of the mind,

1364
01:59:52,068 --> 01:59:55,402
to reside here in wisdom,

1365
01:59:55,859 --> 01:59:58,984
while the storm rages without.

1366
02:00:01,734 --> 02:00:06,151
It will be such a one my son as
the world has not seen before.

1367
02:00:08,525 --> 02:00:11,276
There will be no safety by arms.

1368
02:00:11,776 --> 02:00:14,068
No help from authority.

1369
02:00:14,483 --> 02:00:17,234
No answer in science.

1370
02:00:18,193 --> 02:00:22,276
It will rage till every flower

1371
02:00:22,442 --> 02:00:24,901
of culture is trampled

1372
02:00:25,817 --> 02:00:29,984
and all human beings are leveled

1373
02:00:30,277 --> 02:00:32,987
in a loss chaos.

1374
02:00:33,776 --> 02:00:38,694
Ask yourself, has it
not already begun?

1375
02:00:39,859 --> 02:00:44,068
Do you, really believe that I'll
live to see the end of the storm?

1376
02:00:44,235 --> 02:00:49,028
I do. That is why it is you

1377
02:00:49,901 --> 02:00:52,652
who must preserve

1378
02:00:52,817 --> 02:00:55,527
the fragrance of our history

1379
02:00:56,277 --> 02:01:00,319
and add to it, a touch
of your own mind.

1380
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:04,694
You net…

1381
02:01:05,776 --> 02:01:06,943
I…

1382
02:01:08,151 --> 02:01:09,861
My vision weakens.

1383
02:01:12,859 --> 02:01:14,527
I can see,

1384
02:01:15,609 --> 02:01:17,486
the great distance.

1385
02:01:18,277 --> 02:01:19,736
A new world

1386
02:01:20,734 --> 02:01:23,611
stirring in the ruins.

1387
02:01:24,235 --> 02:01:27,402
Stirring clumsily

1388
02:01:27,650 --> 02:01:29,942
but in hopefulness.

1389
02:01:30,151 --> 02:01:36,610
Seeking its lost and
legendary treasures.

1390
02:01:38,609 --> 02:01:42,444
They will all be here my son.

1391
02:01:44,609 --> 02:01:49,026
Hidden behind the mountains

1392
02:01:50,776 --> 02:01:54,110
in the Valley Of The Blue Moon.

1393
02:01:55,442 --> 02:01:59,068
Preserve in Shangri-La.

1394
02:02:00,442 --> 02:02:01,776
I see...

1395
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:03,819
my...

1396
02:02:05,525 --> 02:02:07,068
miracle.

1397
02:03:29,567 --> 02:03:31,277
And that's the story.

1398
02:03:32,235 --> 02:03:37,028
He said, " I place in your hands the
future and destiny of Shangri-La."

1399
02:03:37,984 --> 02:03:39,861
I now know that

1400
02:03:40,151 --> 02:03:42,318
I found the answers to
all the confusion of the

1401
02:03:42,318 --> 02:03:44,278
world that has plagued
me for a long time.

1402
02:03:45,151 --> 02:03:46,819
I found what I'm searching for…

1403
02:03:50,277 --> 02:03:52,028
I don't know what to say to you.

1404
02:03:53,193 --> 02:03:55,276
Do you really believe
everything he told you?

1405
02:03:55,318 --> 02:03:57,028
Yes, I do.

1406
02:03:57,525 --> 02:03:59,068
Without any proof?

1407
02:03:59,110 --> 02:04:01,028
The proof is in the man himself.

1408
02:04:01,318 --> 02:04:04,236
In everything I've felt.
Here, from the beginning.

1409
02:04:09,318 --> 02:04:11,527
Doesn't the story
mean anything to you?

1410
02:04:11,567 --> 02:04:13,901
What could it mean to me?

1411
02:04:16,567 --> 02:04:20,567
You're right George. This
is no place for you.

1412
02:04:21,068 --> 02:04:23,903
And you should realize it's
no place for you either.

1413
02:04:24,110 --> 02:04:25,945
You're needed in
the outside world

1414
02:04:25,984 --> 02:04:27,610
where the problems are far
more urgent and pressing

1415
02:04:27,650 --> 02:04:29,401
than they are here
in Shangri-La.

1416
02:04:29,567 --> 02:04:32,110
Here, here you
just marking time.

1417
02:04:32,567 --> 02:04:35,609
Besides think of your
obligations to the U.N.

1418
02:04:35,650 --> 02:04:37,234
I know the obligations.

1419
02:04:37,943 --> 02:04:39,360
I know.

1420
02:04:41,235 --> 02:04:43,277
But I've found peace here.

1421
02:04:44,318 --> 02:04:45,777
And I've found love.

1422
02:04:47,277 --> 02:04:49,154
And I must hold on to it.

1423
02:04:52,483 --> 02:04:55,360
I'm going to pack and
see to the others.

1424
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:04,278
Richard, I beg you
to think again.

1425
02:05:05,151 --> 02:05:06,694
And change your mind.

1426
02:06:09,525 --> 02:06:12,567
George, I'm staying.

1427
02:06:15,692 --> 02:06:16,859
Sorry.

1428
02:06:18,984 --> 02:06:20,151
I'm very sorry.

1429
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:24,944
I shall miss you. So will
a lot of other people.

1430
02:06:26,277 --> 02:06:29,778
So you won't be lonely, I've
talked to the rest of them.

1431
02:06:29,984 --> 02:06:31,401
They're staying too.

1432
02:06:33,817 --> 02:06:35,942
So it'll be just Maria and me.

1433
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:37,861
Maria, what she got
to do with it?

1434
02:06:37,984 --> 02:06:39,568
She's coming with me.

1435
02:06:39,859 --> 02:06:42,235
- You can't take her away.
- Why not?

1436
02:06:42,734 --> 02:06:45,235
Don't you know what will happen
to her if she leaves Shangri-La?

1437
02:06:45,318 --> 02:06:47,527
She'll begin to live the happiest part
of her life. That's what will happen.

1438
02:06:47,567 --> 02:06:49,776
She'll begin to live the
last moments of her life.

1439
02:06:50,609 --> 02:06:51,943
Her beauty is…

1440
02:06:53,901 --> 02:06:56,235
She must stay here
where she's safe.

1441
02:06:57,318 --> 02:06:59,777
She's young and strong, she'll
manage the trip all right.

1442
02:06:59,817 --> 02:07:01,652
George listen, she
can't make that trip.

1443
02:07:01,901 --> 02:07:05,068
She's not young and strong. Chang
told me that she came here, …

1444
02:07:05,776 --> 02:07:07,152
80 years ago.

1445
02:07:08,235 --> 02:07:09,235
Eighty?

1446
02:07:10,609 --> 02:07:12,277
What are you talking about?

1447
02:07:13,567 --> 02:07:16,692
Oh come on Richard, you
can't believe that.

1448
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:20,569
You've seen her, she's
not a day over 20.

1449
02:07:20,650 --> 02:07:23,276
Shangri-La will keep her
youthful indefinitely.

1450
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:28,694
I see. And what if she
leaves Shangri-La?

1451
02:07:28,943 --> 02:07:32,277
Chang said she would quickly
revert to her actual age.

1452
02:07:32,650 --> 02:07:34,109
And you must believe it.

1453
02:07:37,692 --> 02:07:42,276
Look, will you believe me
if I prove you're wrong?

1454
02:07:42,943 --> 02:07:45,903
And will you then see that,
if I'm right about Maria,

1455
02:07:46,567 --> 02:07:48,318
I'm probably right
about the rest too.

1456
02:07:48,567 --> 02:07:51,235
I'll die if I have to
stay here alone now.

1457
02:07:51,943 --> 02:07:53,903
George promised he
wouldn't leave me.

1458
02:07:53,984 --> 02:07:55,777
If it weren't for me
you'd never get out.

1459
02:07:55,859 --> 02:07:57,694
It was I who bribed the porters.

1460
02:07:57,901 --> 02:08:01,193
They were forbidden by the High
Lama to take any one out of here.

1461
02:08:02,318 --> 02:08:04,527
- Is it true?
- I was with her.

1462
02:08:04,817 --> 02:08:07,401
They only took the bribe
because he's dead now.

1463
02:08:08,650 --> 02:08:11,942
But aren't you afraid to leave? You
know what will happen if you go.

1464
02:08:12,026 --> 02:08:13,109
Happen?

1465
02:08:14,483 --> 02:08:18,692
Ah, I suppose Chang
told you that I am old.

1466
02:08:19,650 --> 02:08:22,151
That is part of the
myth of Shangri-La.

1467
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:24,237
Chang did tell you didn't he.

1468
02:08:24,567 --> 02:08:25,692
Yes.

1469
02:08:27,609 --> 02:08:29,319
Look at me Mr. Conway,

1470
02:08:30,901 --> 02:08:32,861
Do I look like an old woman?

1471
02:08:35,400 --> 02:08:37,650
Is this the skin
of an old woman?

1472
02:08:38,943 --> 02:08:41,235
Are these the eyes
of an old woman?

1473
02:08:43,734 --> 02:08:49,318
And in my heart, are these the
feedings of an old woman?

1474
02:08:50,734 --> 02:08:53,652
Do you believe I have
been here for 80 years?

1475
02:08:56,360 --> 02:08:58,527
Like us, she was kidnapped.

1476
02:08:59,151 --> 02:09:01,527
They brought her here
just two years ago.

1477
02:09:01,609 --> 02:09:03,943
Well I don't believe it. I
can't believe it. She's lying.

1478
02:09:04,235 --> 02:09:07,153
You're lying every word you said is a lie.
Now come on admit it.

1479
02:09:07,277 --> 02:09:09,402
What reason would
I have for lying?

1480
02:09:10,817 --> 02:09:12,485
Look Mr. Conway,

1481
02:09:12,943 --> 02:09:16,861
the chances are, we will never live
through this terrible journey.

1482
02:09:17,901 --> 02:09:20,569
But, I would rather go
out there with George,

1483
02:09:20,650 --> 02:09:24,610
and die in a snowstorm than
stay here one minute more.

1484
02:09:25,776 --> 02:09:27,486
But why have they
told me this story!

1485
02:09:27,483 --> 02:09:28,900
Because they need you here.

1486
02:09:29,483 --> 02:09:32,067
Sally and the others have already
found ways to be useful,

1487
02:09:32,193 --> 02:09:35,443
But you're the one they were
after, you had to be convinced.

1488
02:09:36,525 --> 02:09:39,692
But your job isn't here and
you must realize that now.

1489
02:09:41,277 --> 02:09:42,945
Are you telling me the truth?

1490
02:09:50,859 --> 02:09:54,901
I am 20 years old and I was
brought here two years ago.

1491
02:10:14,151 --> 02:10:15,944
I'm going to need your
help on this journey.

1492
02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:17,610
We both are.

1493
02:10:18,776 --> 02:10:20,319
Please come with us Richard.

1494
02:10:21,734 --> 02:10:23,110
I believe her.

1495
02:10:24,483 --> 02:10:25,483
Humph.

1496
02:10:26,235 --> 02:10:29,235
I once said to Chang that I
was afraid this was a dream

1497
02:10:29,235 --> 02:10:32,360
from which I might suddenly
and unhappily awake.

1498
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:37,861
All right, I'll come with you.

1499
02:10:53,193 --> 02:10:55,111
Catherine!

1500
02:10:59,817 --> 02:11:01,610
Catherine?

1501
02:11:39,776 --> 02:11:40,859
To Len.

1502
02:11:48,984 --> 02:11:50,861
- Yes Mr. Conway.
- Where's Catherine?

1503
02:11:51,442 --> 02:11:53,943
Chang has given orders that
she cannot be disturbed.

1504
02:11:53,984 --> 02:11:55,360
But where is she,
I must see her.

1505
02:11:56,901 --> 02:11:59,527
I regret that is not
possible Mr. Conway.

1506
02:11:59,567 --> 02:12:02,650
Richard! Richard come on.

1507
02:12:02,859 --> 02:12:04,360
I can't find Catherine.

1508
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:06,402
I'm sorry, but the
porters won't wait.

1509
02:12:08,776 --> 02:12:11,110
Richard, the porters won't wait.

1510
02:12:50,943 --> 02:12:52,694
I hope they make it.

1511
02:12:53,734 --> 02:12:55,527
Doesn't tempt you,
does it Harry?

1512
02:12:57,235 --> 02:12:58,527
Not me Sam.

1513
02:13:03,859 --> 02:13:05,485
We can still go with
them if you want to.

1514
02:13:51,193 --> 02:13:53,736
What's happened?
Where's Richard?

1515
02:13:53,984 --> 02:13:55,944
He's leaving my child.

1516
02:13:57,318 --> 02:13:59,485
- Leaving?!
- But, he will return.

1517
02:14:00,984 --> 02:14:02,276
Richard!

1518
02:14:11,609 --> 02:14:12,651
Richard!

1519
02:14:37,817 --> 02:14:39,193
Richard.

1520
02:14:39,817 --> 02:14:41,401
Richard, hurry!

1521
02:15:12,734 --> 02:15:13,694
Richard!

1522
02:15:15,901 --> 02:15:17,068
Richard!

1523
02:15:23,318 --> 02:15:24,443
Richard!

1524
02:15:40,692 --> 02:15:41,942
Richard.

1525
02:16:46,026 --> 02:16:47,318
[Hundunn!]

1526
02:17:00,277 --> 02:17:01,820
Can't you get them to wait.

1527
02:17:01,943 --> 02:17:04,026
They're leaving us
father behind everyday.

1528
02:17:04,277 --> 02:17:06,444
They're only trying to save themselves.
We're too slow.

1529
02:17:06,483 --> 02:17:09,360
I am sorry. I cannot go faster.

1530
02:17:09,442 --> 02:17:11,360
I cannot move faster.

1531
02:17:12,360 --> 02:17:15,402
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey! Hey!

1532
02:17:18,442 --> 02:17:19,818
[Hoodelee]

1533
02:17:37,901 --> 02:17:39,110
Aahh!

1534
02:18:42,692 --> 02:18:43,817
Richard.

1535
02:18:46,110 --> 02:18:47,152
Help me.

1536
02:18:55,734 --> 02:18:58,943
I must rest. I cannot
go on any longer.

1537
02:18:59,692 --> 02:19:00,942
I must rest!

1538
02:19:02,235 --> 02:19:03,736
I'll carry her.

1539
02:19:44,859 --> 02:19:46,984
Richard? Richard!

1540
02:19:48,277 --> 02:19:50,154
Richard, her-her face!

1541
02:19:50,817 --> 02:19:52,485
Look at her face!

1542
02:20:06,442 --> 02:20:08,235
There's a cave over there.

1543
02:20:22,483 --> 02:20:23,692
Help me.

1544
02:20:30,151 --> 02:20:31,151
There.

1545
02:20:49,609 --> 02:20:50,692
Ugh.

1546
02:21:00,609 --> 02:21:02,360
No!

1547
02:21:03,235 --> 02:21:04,527
No!

1548
02:21:04,650 --> 02:21:05,900
- Oh no!
- George!

1549
02:21:06,110 --> 02:21:08,319
No no!

1550
02:21:08,318 --> 02:21:09,694
- George!
- No!

1551
02:21:10,193 --> 02:21:15,485
Aaaahh!

1552
02:22:17,400 --> 02:22:18,859
Aah!

1553
02:23:02,984 --> 02:23:04,193
Doctor.

1554
02:23:10,277 --> 02:23:11,945
How are you Mr. Conway?

1555
02:23:12,817 --> 02:23:15,193
I dreamt for a moment
that I was back again.

1556
02:23:15,442 --> 02:23:17,609
Back again? Where?

1557
02:23:18,817 --> 02:23:20,276
Where?

1558
02:23:20,776 --> 02:23:22,110
How are you feeling?

1559
02:23:23,567 --> 02:23:27,984
I don't know whether I've
been mad, and now sane or,

1560
02:23:28,734 --> 02:23:33,110
I was sane for a time
and now mad again.

1561
02:23:35,068 --> 02:23:36,736
Mr. Conway.

1562
02:23:38,068 --> 02:23:39,694
How do you know my name?

1563
02:23:39,817 --> 02:23:43,067
The whole world knows your name
and wonders what happened to you?

1564
02:23:43,442 --> 02:23:47,152
You were flying back from a U.N. peace
mission when your plane disappeared.

1565
02:23:48,650 --> 02:23:50,360
Peace mission.

1566
02:23:51,318 --> 02:23:54,819
- Did we succeeded?
- Sadly no.

1567
02:23:55,110 --> 02:23:56,903
But there's always hope.

1568
02:23:58,026 --> 02:24:00,652
Yes hope.

1569
02:24:02,442 --> 02:24:04,193
It must be that.

1570
02:24:30,692 --> 02:24:32,775
Mr. Ferguson, I'm Dr. Verden.

1571
02:24:33,110 --> 02:24:34,486
I told Conway you're coming.

1572
02:24:34,525 --> 02:24:37,567
- Oh good. This is my associate Theo Murphy.
- How do you do.

1573
02:24:37,650 --> 02:24:39,026
- Dr..
- Please come with me.

1574
02:24:39,859 --> 02:24:40,652
Follow me.

1575
02:24:43,650 --> 02:24:46,318
When the tribesmen found him
wandering in the lower valley,

1576
02:24:46,360 --> 02:24:47,861
he was totally lost.

1577
02:24:48,151 --> 02:24:51,527
Suffering from snow blindness
and near starvation.

1578
02:24:51,734 --> 02:24:54,984
Despite this, they had a hard
time getting him to the village.

1579
02:24:55,110 --> 02:24:57,820
So keen was he to get
back into the mountains.

1580
02:24:57,943 --> 02:25:00,235
To get to this place
called Shangri-La.

1581
02:25:00,442 --> 02:25:03,110
Shangri-La. Yes, that
was in your report.

1582
02:25:03,193 --> 02:25:05,360
- But do you think...?
- You'll hear about it from him.

1583
02:25:06,068 --> 02:25:06,819
Come.

1584
02:25:17,567 --> 02:25:18,817
Where he is he?

1585
02:25:20,567 --> 02:25:22,235
I'm afraid you arrived too late.

1586
02:25:23,984 --> 02:25:24,902
He's gone.

1587
02:25:25,068 --> 02:25:25,903
Gone?

1588
02:25:33,776 --> 02:25:35,110
Shangri-La.

1589
02:25:35,943 --> 02:25:39,193
On and on he talked about
this fantastic place.

1590
02:25:39,901 --> 02:25:42,068
He must return. He must return!

1591
02:25:43,442 --> 02:25:45,525
Obviously right now that's
what he's trying to do.

1592
02:25:45,567 --> 02:25:46,859
But I've got to find him.

1593
02:25:47,110 --> 02:25:48,694
It's my job to take him home.

1594
02:25:49,068 --> 02:25:52,151
Your job won't be easy Mr. Ferguson,
even if you do find him.

1595
02:25:52,859 --> 02:25:54,819
This, obsession if you will,

1596
02:25:54,859 --> 02:25:58,318
kept him alive in the wilderness,
beyond all human endurance.

1597
02:25:58,817 --> 02:26:01,485
Even here his convalescence
is do less to medicine,

1598
02:26:01,984 --> 02:26:05,694
than to that, all consuming
passion to return.

1599
02:26:06,943 --> 02:26:08,736
In Richard Conway's mind,

1600
02:26:09,151 --> 02:26:14,111
Shangri-La represents the
ultimate way of life.

1601
02:26:14,567 --> 02:26:19,360
It's ah, Shangri-La.
Do you believe it?

1602
02:26:22,277 --> 02:26:23,861
Yes, I believe it.

1603
02:26:25,984 --> 02:26:30,026
I believe it, because
I want to believe it.

1604
02:27:16,776 --> 02:27:21,152
? There's a Lost Horizon, ?

1605
02:27:21,776 --> 02:27:25,527
? waiting to be found. ?

1606
02:27:26,692 --> 02:27:30,193
? There's a Lost Horizon ?

1607
02:27:30,318 --> 02:27:34,902
? where the sound of guns ?

1608
02:27:36,609 --> 02:27:41,692
? doesn't pound in your ears, ?

1609
02:27:43,692 --> 02:27:47,652
? anymore. ?
