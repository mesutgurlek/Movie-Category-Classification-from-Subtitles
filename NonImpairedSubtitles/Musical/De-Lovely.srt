1
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,400
Hello, Cole.

2
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,500
l let myself in.

3
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,900
We're not late, are we? l hate to be late.

4
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,300
No, we're fine.

5
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,600
That sounded lovely.

6
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,500
l hate funeral music.

7
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,700
Though, under the circumstances,
l suppose l should say my prayers.

8
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,900
Why start now?

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,200
Exactly.

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,400
lf l believed in God,
he would be a song-and-dance man.

11
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,800
He would have to carry a tune.
Preferably one of mine.

12
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,900
Do you think he would like this?

13
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,600
In the still of the night

14
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,600
As I gaze from my window

15
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,400
At the moon in its flight

16
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,100
My thoughts all stray to you

17
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,800
You wrote that about Linda, of course.

18
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,400
Did l?

19
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,900
Songs don't have to be about
someone, you know.

20
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,500
We should start.

21
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,400
l thought we had.

22
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,000
Cole, you have to play us into it.

23
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,300
lt's your life. Your music will be our guide.

24
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Swell.

25
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,900
In the still of the night

26
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,100
As I gaze from my window

27
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,700
Oh, my God, that's me! l'm so young.

28
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,300
You satisfied?

29
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,900
He's very good.

30
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,100
He's not much of a singer.

31
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,100
You never were.

32
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,800
In the still of the night

33
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,800
The words, l can't hear the words.

34
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,400
While the world is in slumber

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,900
What's the matter, can't he take direction?

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,600
Cole, talk to me,
l'll pass your thoughts along.

37
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,400
He can't hear you.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,500
ln a musical,
everyone works for the composer.

39
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,800
Times have changed. May l borrow this?

40
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,000
Times have changed

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Never open with a ballad.

42
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,000
This isn't one of
those avant-garde things, is it?

43
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,100
lt's got to be entertaining, it's a musical.

44
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,400
And a love story, of course.

45
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,600
A little unconventional, but honest.

46
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,900
You're playing with my life.

47
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,900
lt's my show.

48
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,600
Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,800
Plymouth Rock

50
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,500
would land on them

51
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,100
In olden days

52
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,100
lt's your life, Cole.

53
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,700
Was looked on something shocking

54
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,100
Oh, my God.

55
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,900
lt's an opening number, of course.

56
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,000
lt's the Berlins.

57
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,600
lrving, Ellin.

58
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,600
lrving gave me my start.
This is my whole life.

59
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,700
There's Monty Woolley from Yale.
Look at Monty.

60
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,700
That costume is all wrong.
He never wore that.

61
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,900
That's all wrong. Change it.

62
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,900
And black's white today
And day's night today

63
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,100
L. B. Mayer and the gang from MGM.

64
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,000
The Hollywood years.

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,400
When folks who still can ride in jitneys

66
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,400
found out that Vanderbilts and Whitneys
lack baby clothes

67
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,300
Anything goes

68
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,000
Boris and Jack.

69
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,100
Bill Wrather.

70
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,900
Gerald, Sara, Honoria, where are the boys?

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,100
Boys.

72
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,100
Anything goes

73
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,400
Hi, Mom.

74
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,700
And every night, the set that's smart

75
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,300
is intruding on nudist parties in studios

76
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,500
Anything goes

77
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,600
Fantastic.

78
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,900
So though I'm not a great romancer

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,700
I know that you're bound to answer
when I propose

80
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,000
Anything goes

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,300
If saying your prayers you like,
if green pears you like

82
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,200
If old chairs you like, if backstairs you like,
If love affairs you like

83
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,500
Stop, this is wrong for Linda.

84
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,100
She should sing a different part, stop.

85
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,600
ls it me?

86
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,200
No, dear.

87
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,400
lt's backstairs and love affairs.
lt's too early for complications.

88
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,500
We're gonna get ready for Paris.
lf you're not in Paris, l'll see you later.

89
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,400
Come on, move along.

90
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,100
You're doing beautifully.
But then, you always do.

91
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,100
Remember, it's your story, too.
lt's a love story.

92
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,700
-That's why l'm frightened.
-Don't be.

93
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,400
Have you ever seen a musical
without a happy ending?

94
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,800
All right, then.

95
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,300
We've just heard Anything Goes...

96
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,100
as if it's Cole's declaration of independence.

97
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,300
lndependence from whom?

98
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,700
Never mind.

99
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,200
Don't argue with the director, love.
Leave that to me.

100
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,800
He's very strict.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,400
She can't hear you.

102
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,600
l know.

103
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,600
You're seeing Cole for the first time.

104
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,900
You start to move towards him...

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,500
because there's a spirit in his eye.

106
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,700
Go ahead.

107
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,900
Move slowly.

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,600
You'll be fine.

109
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,500
Weren't we fools to lose each other?

110
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,700
Weren't we fools to say goodbye?

111
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,000
God, she was beautiful.

112
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,400
She could stop your heart.

113
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
No, start it.

114
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,000
You chose another

115
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
So did I

116
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,800
If we'd realized
our love was worth defending

117
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,500
Then the story's broken threads
we might be mending

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,600
They're so good, it's a shame
more people aren't paying attention.

119
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,000
Cole can take care of that.

120
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,300
Which one is Cole Porter?

121
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,200
The one who's standing, who's being
so serious about being playful...

122
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,800
that's my husband Gerald.

123
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,900
And the one who's playing at not being
serious at all, that's Cole Porter.

124
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,600
-Has somebody died?
-l think it was us, Cole.

125
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,000
-Linda Lee.
-Sara Murphy.

126
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,700
-We met at Lady Mendel's.
-Yes, indeed.

127
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,000
ls that Linda Lee Thomas with Sara?

128
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,400
-l really couldn't say.
-No, it is, and just as they described her:

129
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,800
The most beautiful divorcée in Paris.
My God, she's ravishing.

130
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,800
ls this gonna be another Porter fascination?
An obsession without preliminaries?

131
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,800
Obsessions don't have preliminaries.

132
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,200
-Will you join me?
-l'm a married man.

133
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,300
No, come on grab a chair.

134
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,400
Let's really light a fire
under these deadbeats.

135
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,600
You begin.

136
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,000
I have heard, among this clan

137
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,100
You are called ''the forgotten man''

138
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,500
Well, did you ever?

139
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,100
What a swell party this is

140
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,300
Have you heard that Mimsie Starr
just got pinched in the Astor Bar?

141
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,200
Well, did you ever?

142
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,500
What a swell party this is

143
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Take over.

144
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,200
-You're not gonna pinch her in the ass?
-l might.

145
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,200
Reggie's rather scatterbrained

146
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,900
He dove in when the pool was drained

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,400
Well, did you ever?

148
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,900
What a swell party this is

149
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,400
It's great, it's grand

150
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,900
It's wonderland

151
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,200
It's tops, it's first

152
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,800
It's DuPont, it's Hearst

153
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,200
What clothes, quel chic

154
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,700
What pearls, they're the peak

155
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,300
What glamor, what cheer

156
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,900
This will simply slay you, dear

157
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,300
Have you heard the coast of Maine
just got hit by a hurricane?

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,200
Well, did you ever?

159
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,900
What a swell party this is

160
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,400
Have you heard that poor dear Blanche

161
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,800
Got run down by an avalanche?

162
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,900
Well, did you ever?
What a swell party this is

163
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,800
What daiquiris

164
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,200
What sherry, please

165
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,300
What burgundy

166
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,000
What great Pommery

167
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,300
What brandy, wow

168
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,100
What whiskey, here's how

169
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
What gin and what beer

170
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,200
Will you sober up, my dear?

171
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,900
Have you heard, Professor Munch

172
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,300
ate his wife and divorced his lunch?

173
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,300
Well, did you ever?
What a swell party this is

174
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,200
Have you heard, it's in the stars

175
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,000
Next July, we collide with Mars?

176
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,400
Well, did you ever?
What a swell party

177
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,000
a swell party, a swellegant, elegant party

178
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,400
this is!

179
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,300
God, we're a hit!

180
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,400
Now we have a party.

181
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,800
-Shall we?
-Yes, let's.

182
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,300
My God.

183
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,300
Grace personified.

184
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Was that me? Did l sweep you off your feet?

185
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,600
Because l hadn't intended
to do that for quite a while.

186
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,800
You really are smooth,
aren't you, Mr. Porter?

187
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,200
Never till now, Mrs. Thomas.

188
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,500
Your song was absolutely delirious.

189
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Thank you. l'm never sure
if they get the joke.

190
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,400
-Especially when it's on them.
-Learn to trust your audience.

191
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,300
l trust it, l just wish l could expand it.

192
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,500
He seems a bit calculating, don't you think?

193
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,000
-Weren't you?
-Not entirely.

194
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,800
l said l was ambitious,
but l was anything but an opportunist.

195
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,800
After all, l spent 10 years in Paris...

196
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,400
just having fun.

197
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,300
What are we talking here, a love affair?

198
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,700
A business proposition...

199
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,800
or a social arrangement?

200
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,700
There was nothing arranged...

201
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,700
or negotiated about our relationship.

202
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,600
lt was...

203
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,000
our own.

204
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,400
What about these gloves? ls it really true...

205
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,200
that you only wear them once
and then you discard them?

206
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
Yes.

207
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,400
To where do you discard them
when you're finished?

208
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,200
l send them to a cousin in Louisville.

209
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,900
Not this one, all right? Let me keep this.

210
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,000
Look at that hand. You should never
cover your hands, they're beautiful.

211
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,100
-They're ungainly.
-No, they're strong.

212
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,000
No one's ever thought of me
as strong before.

213
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,700
l think of you as strong and down to earth...

214
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,200
-and solid. l think of you in many ways.
-You're sweet.

215
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,300
lsn't that Diaghilev and his boy
from the Ballets Russes?

216
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,400
That's his premier danseur.

217
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,900
-Would you like to meet them?
-Don't know, would l?

218
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,600
Perhaps another time. Bonjour.

219
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,100
He is an acquaintance from yesterday.

220
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,700
An unmanned piano. Come on.

221
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,100
I know you hate to hear

222
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,300
That I adore you, dear

223
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,200
Not you, dear.

224
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,700
But grant me, just the same

225
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,300
I'm not entirely to blame

226
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,000
For

227
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,800
you'd be

228
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,600
so easy to love

229
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,100
Christ, that cue is as loud as my whistle.

230
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,200
And it's too early for another song.

231
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,100
lf you can say it better than
you write it, fine. Otherwise, Cole sings.

232
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,700
All right.

233
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,200
The yearning for

234
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,500
So swell to keep every home fire

235
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Thank you.

236
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,700
Burning for

237
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,300
We'd be so grand at the game

238
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,000
So carefree together

239
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,200
that it does seem a shame

240
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,500
If you can't see

241
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Your future with me

242
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,300
'Cause you'd be

243
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,700
oh, so easy to love

244
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,500
Dear Cole.

245
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,300
You have so much nerve, Mr. Porter.
God, l'd be frightened.

246
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,300
l'm just showing off.

247
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,000
There are much worse things to be afraid of.

248
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,900
You have a dazzling gift
and a life to go with it.

249
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,600
What could you possibly be afraid of?

250
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,300
Myself.

251
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,400
l'm not afraid of that.

252
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
l hope you never will be.

253
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,700
Even when you really get to know me.

254
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,500
We'd be so grand

255
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,700
at the game

256
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So carefree together

257
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,900
that it does seem a shame

258
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,600
If you

259
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,900
can't see

260
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,500
Your future with me

261
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,100
'Cause you'd be

262
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,700
oh, so easy

263
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,500
to love

264
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,700
l thought you would be
tired of your apartment.

265
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,000
You're gonna have to help me out here.

266
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,200
l mean, if this is really you.

267
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,100
Why?

268
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,500
This is how it was. This is how l was.

269
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,000
l wanted every kind of love
that was available.

270
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,000
I could never find them in the same person.

271
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,500
Or the same sex.

272
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,800
l've never had the urge to be
completely honest with anyone until you.

273
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,100
lt's quite disturbing.

274
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,000
Especially since l haven't been
totally honest.

275
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,100
You knew so much about me
when we met, Cole...

276
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,300
don't you think l'd heard
a thing or two about you?

277
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,800
Then you know about....

278
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,900
Well, that l can be....

279
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,200
That l have...

280
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,100
other interests.

281
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,200
lnterests, the pursuit of which
some people might find cruel to you.

282
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,000
You mean men?

283
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,500
Yes, men.

284
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,100
Let's just say you like them more than l do.

285
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,900
Nothing is cruel that fulfills your promise.

286
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,700
l've been promising all my life.

287
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,000
l've got a notebook
full of promise. Trunks full.

288
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,900
l want to be more than promising to you.

289
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,400
We could fulfill your promise together.

290
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,100
We could be singular as a couple.

291
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,200
Would you stay for dinner?

292
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,700
lt will be just us.

293
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,400
l'd like that.

294
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,400
So, did you love her then?

295
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,500
Then? I don't know.

296
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,100
I thought I might discover what love was.

297
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,900
The physical side was always....

298
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,300
We could take it or leave it.

299
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,100
It was pleasant enough.

300
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,800
But the intimacy was stunning.

301
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,300
Good morning.

302
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,100
What's that?

303
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,200
lt's an idea for a song.

304
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,300
This part, right here,
l think would go nicely with...

305
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,600
''l love you.''

306
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,300
What do you think?

307
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,200
l think that would be beautiful.

308
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,400
l do, you know.

309
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,100
You don't have to love me
the way that l love you, Cole.

310
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,700
Just love me.

311
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,200
lt's so easy.

312
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,700
This verse you've started seems to me

313
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,600
The Tin Pan-tithesis of melody

314
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,700
So to spare you all the pain

315
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,600
Monty.

316
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,400
l almost didn't recognize you
under all that hair.

317
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,700
We've all matured since school, Coley.

318
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,200
At Yale, the only grooms
that interested you were in the stables.

319
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,100
Monty, behave yourself.
This is the happiest day of my life.

320
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,200
The night is young, the skies are clear

321
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,900
So if you wanna go walking, dear

322
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,100
Along with the bluebird, dogwood is
the great harbinger of the Kentucky spring.

323
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
-They're beautiful.
-Thank you.

324
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,600
l'm ready.

325
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,400
Ma'am.

326
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,300
Where is he?

327
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,300
You might prefer privacy.

328
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,300
l would not.

329
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,900
To holy matrimony, then.

330
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,600
And whatever further perforations
you may put in it.

331
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,200
-Excuse me.
-What?

332
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,300
Sorry, Monty.

333
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,400
lt's good to see you again, Mrs. Thomas.

334
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,300
-lt's Mrs. Porter.
-Not yet.

335
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,200
Don't blame poor Cody...

336
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,400
he was only doing what l told him.

337
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,400
My name never suited?
Thomas not proper enough?

338
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,800
lt's another name for ''shame.''

339
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,000
So now you're all snug and proper, are you?

340
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,900
Marrying this fawn?

341
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
Why are you here, Edward?

342
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,300
There's a certain section of the bar here.

343
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,900
The left side, l think, significantly enough...

344
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,400
where your groom and his gentleman
friends like to call on each other.

345
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,100
l assumed, for symbolic purposes at least...

346
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,300
that the wedding would be held there.
l had to assume, you see...

347
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,100
since my invitation never arrived.

348
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
-l would invite you to hell.
-No need.

349
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,400
Already there.
Too bad you never cared for it.

350
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,200
ln spite of caring for you once--

351
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,600
My fault, then.
You offered care, l needed passion.

352
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,400
What does the fawn need?

353
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,900
Can you supply him?
Surely not with everything.

354
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,600
And what can he give you?

355
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,800
Pride.

356
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,200
Don't turn your back on me, Mrs. Thomas.

357
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,900
That's so funny.

358
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,300
From what l remember,
it was the position you most favored.

359
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,700
-Are you all right?
-l'm fine.

360
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Wait.

361
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,600
Mr. Thomas, you have
the most peculiar sense of timing.

362
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,200
You think you can make her happy
because you won't violate her delicacy?

363
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,500
Because you don't need her as a woman?

364
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,500
l think maybe
we define ''woman'' differently.

365
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,500
l don't define it as ''punching bag,''
for instance.

366
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,400
Cole's not like you. He creates, you destroy.

367
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,900
And as you can see,
you're a failure even at that.

368
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,200
Let's get married.

369
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,800
See the crowd in that church

370
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,200
See the proud parson plopped on his perch

371
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,500
Get the sweet beat of that organ

372
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,100
sealing our doom

373
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,800
Here goes the groom, boom!

374
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,800
How they cheer and how they smile

375
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,000
As we go galloping down the aisle

376
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,900
It's divine, dear, it's diveen, dear

377
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's de-wunderbar, it's de-victory

378
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,500
It's de-vallop, it's de-vinner
It's de-voiks

379
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,600
-Mrs. Murphy?
-Absolutely.

380
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,800
The knot is tied and so we take

381
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,800
A few hours off to eat wedding cake

382
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,200
It's delightful, it's delicious

383
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,300
It's de-lovely

384
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,200
It feels so fine

385
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,900
-Thank you, dearest.
-For what?

386
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,400
For all of this, for our future.

387
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,400
For being with me just now with Edward.

388
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,000
That was nothing.
That was pest control, that's all.

389
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,900
To the pop of champagne

390
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,600
Off we hop in our plush little plane

391
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,700
Till a bright light through the darkness

392
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,900
They seem so happy.

393
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,900
Let's hope he doesn't misbehave.

394
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:40,300
Our day's complete
And what a beautiful bridal suite

395
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,600
It's dreamy, it's drowsy

396
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,800
It's de-reverie, it's de-rhapsody

397
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,300
It's de-regal, it's de-royal

398
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,600
It's de-Ritz, it's de-lovely

399
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,600
We settle down

400
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,300
as man and wife

401
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,600
To solve the riddle called married life

402
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,100
It's delightful

403
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,500
It's delicious

404
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,900
Now you love her, yes?

405
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,700
l said the words.

406
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,800
l meant them.

407
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,300
l wanted to mean them.

408
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,000
God knows l wrote them often enough.

409
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,600
And even more after we were married.

410
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,700
Maybe that says something.

411
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,100
They did always sound better
with music under them.

412
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,300
God, she was beautiful.

413
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,700
Venice.

414
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,300
We had such parties.

415
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,100
We had a floating dance floor
on the Grand Canal.

416
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,600
You know that Robert Browning
once lived in that palazzo?

417
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,000
He got a lot more written than I did,
but he didn't have half the fun.

418
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,800
There they are. Hello, Berlins.

419
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,200
Welcome to Palazzo Rezzonico.

420
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,100
I got so out of hand that finally
Linda had to bring in reinforcements.

421
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,400
And being Linda, she brought the best.

422
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,200
She single-handedly
orchestrated my reformation.

423
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,400
l have to say, the music is not bad, either.

424
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,700
-ls that Cole?
-Yes, it is.

425
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
This funny thing

426
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,000
called love

427
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,000
Just who can solve its mystery?

428
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,800
Cole?

429
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,900
You're lrving Berlin.

430
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
-Am l interrupting?
-No, l mean, yes.

431
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,800
But it's an honor to be interrupted
by America's greatest songwriter.

432
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,000
-What a pleasure.
-The most publicized, that's for sure.

433
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,800
And rightfully so.

434
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,600
Linda has told us so much about you,
she's left out the most important stuff.

435
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,100
-What would that be?
-Your songs.

436
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,100
l heard about them, but l've never actually
heard one played before.

437
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,700
You were listening to that?
That's a bit daunting.

438
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
l need a drink. Can l offer you something?

439
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,100
No, it's okay.
l'm gonna let you get back to your work.

440
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,600
l'd love to hear the tune when it's done.

441
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,600
lt's a real pleasure. A real pleasure.

442
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,000
-Pleasure's mine, welcome to Venice.
-Thank you very much.

443
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,100
-We'll have some fun later.
-l look forward to that, Cole.

444
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,400
I was a humdrum person

445
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,600
Leading a life apart

446
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,600
When love flew in through my window wide

447
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,900
And quickened my humdrum heart

448
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,300
Love flew in through my window

449
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,100
I was so happy then

450
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,300
But after love

451
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,800
had stayed a little while

452
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,100
Love flew out again

453
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,900
What is this thing called love?

454
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,800
This funny thing

455
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,400
called love?

456
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:54,500
Just who can solve its mystery?

457
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,000
Why should it make

458
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,800
a fool of me?

459
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,600
I saw you there

460
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,300
one wonderful day

461
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,800
You took my heart

462
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,200
and threw it away

463
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,500
That's why I ask the Lord

464
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,400
in heaven above

465
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,800
What is this thing

466
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,700
called love?

467
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:37,000
What is this thing called love?

468
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,900
This funny thing

469
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
called love?

470
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,400
Just who can solve its mystery?

471
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,500
Why should it make

472
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,600
a fool of me?

473
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,900
I saw you there

474
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,600
one wonderful day

475
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:10,000
You took my heart and threw it away

476
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,400
That's why I ask the Lord

477
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,700
in heaven above

478
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,500
What is this thing

479
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,900
called love?

480
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,100
Bravo, Cole.

481
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,200
You know, Cole, you're spoiling us.

482
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,100
And, excuse me, you're pampering yourself.

483
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,600
You have far too much talent
to waste as an amateur.

484
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,300
And we must do something about that.

485
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,400
l think it may be the most beautiful
love song you've written yet.

486
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Why, thank you.
There's quite a bit of you in it.

487
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,000
What do you think you'll call it?

488
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,100
l don't know, something about confusion.

489
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,300
Dinner is served.

490
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,500
Yes, let's eat.

491
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,300
Thank you for your indulgence.

492
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,800
That was the truth, for the most part.

493
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,900
There was a lot of Linda in that song.

494
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,200
I wish there could have been more.

495
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,400
We are leaving soon, you know.
The tour begins.

496
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,000
l heard.

497
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,400
l don't like it one bit.

498
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,200
l don't know
what l'm going to do without you.

499
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,800
Of course, you know...

500
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,200
it is only a European tour...

501
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,400
and l can travel.

502
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,100
l could mysteriously appear
in certain European cities from time to time.

503
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,200
But you are a married man.
What about Mrs. Porter?

504
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,700
Boris, l've told you...

505
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,100
Mrs. Porter...

506
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,100
tries very hard to want what l want.

507
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,600
Surely not everything.

508
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,500
Whatever l need.

509
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,400
As long as she knows
the rest belongs to her.

510
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,400
And what is the rest?

511
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,600
Everything that happens in the daylight.

512
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,700
Which is why l have to go.

513
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,700
-l'll see you there?
-Of course.

514
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,400
You could have a great career

515
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,100
And you should, yes, you should

516
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,700
Only one thing stops you, dear

517
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,400
You're too good, way too good

518
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,900
If you want a future, darling,
why don't you get a past?

519
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,100
'Cause that fatal moment's coming at last

520
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,900
We're all alone, no chaperone

521
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,600
Can get our number

522
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,900
The world's in slumber

523
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,900
Let's misbehave

524
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:12,500
There's something wild about you, child
It's so contagious

525
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,500
Let's be outrageous

526
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,100
Let's misbehave

527
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,500
When Adam won Eve's hand

528
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,100
He wouldn't stand for teasing

529
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,000
He didn't care about
those apples out of season

530
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,700
They say that spring means just one thing

531
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,200
To little lovebirds

532
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,400
We're not above birds, let's misbehave

533
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,000
l'm being hailed.

534
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,000
lt's from lrving.

535
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,900
lrving?

536
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,200
-You knew.
-l had hoped.

537
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,600
No, you knew.

538
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,600
Okay, l didn't know
what the show was to be called.

539
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,500
lt's to be called Paris.

540
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,100
And lrving has assured the producer...

541
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,800
that l'm the only one
with the suitable sophistication...

542
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,300
to do the show.

543
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,800
So it seems that we would be
leaving Venice...

544
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,700
to go to New York to do a show called Paris.

545
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,300
We'll go, won't we?

546
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,800
Darling, what do you think?

547
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,600
l know you would like to.

548
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,500
You orchestrated the whole thing,
you willed it into being.

549
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,300
l'm just not sure l'm ready.

550
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,300
Cole, l promise you, you are ready.

551
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,800
lrving Berlin believes in your talent.

552
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,400
He wouldn't recommend you
simply out of friendship.

553
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,100
No, l suppose not.

554
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,300
Cole, it will be a wonderful chance for you,
and a good change for us.

555
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,200
Yes.

556
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,600
Yes, we'll go?

557
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,200
Yes, it will be a big change.

558
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,400
l think we need a change.

559
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
l never intended this
to cause a breach between us.

560
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,800
lt hasn't, it just....

561
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,700
Cole, we never had a formal agreement,
we don't need one now.

562
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,400
lt's done.

563
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,400
l can't promise you that.

564
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,100
Just so it doesn't put us in jeopardy.

565
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,200
Or your music.

566
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,400
You really love me that much?

567
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,300
You are the rhythm of my heart.

568
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,100
They're playing your song.
Would you care to dance?

569
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,500
Why not?

570
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,800
They say that bears have love affairs

571
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,300
And even camels

572
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,300
We're merely mammals, let's misbehave

573
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,100
See, true love.

574
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,700
l'm not so sure about true.

575
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,400
Linda played that beautifully.

576
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,400
l think that's when l began to really love her.

577
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,400
All right, Linda, Cole,
smile if you're in love, please.

578
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,100
Didn't that make things
even more complicated?

579
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,400
-What things?
-Your other relationships.

580
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,100
No, why should it?

581
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,500
Isn't that why birds do it, bees do it?

582
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,300
Even educated fleas do it

583
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,000
Let's do it

584
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,900
Let's fall in love

585
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,200
In Spain, the best upper sets do it

586
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,300
Lithuanians and Letts do it

587
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,400
Let's do it

588
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,200
Let's fall in love

589
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,900
The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it

590
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,900
Not to mention the Finns

591
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,200
Welcome, sir.

592
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,400
Folks in Siam do it

593
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,900
Think of Siamese twins

594
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,200
Say hello to Mrs. Porter.

595
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,700
Richard, would you please take my hat?

596
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,300
People say in Boston, even beans do it

597
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,500
Let's do it, let's fall in love

598
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,500
Cold Cape Cod clams

599
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,200
against their wish, do it

600
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,500
Even lazy jellyfish do it

601
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,800
Let's do it, let's fall in love

602
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:59,600
Electric eels, I might add, do it

603
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,000
Though it shocks them, I know

604
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,500
Why ask if shad do it?

605
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,400
Waiter, bring me shad roe

606
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,900
In shallow shoals, English soles do it

607
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,700
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it

608
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,700
Let's do it

609
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,400
Let's fall in love

610
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:29,400
The dragonflies in the reeds do it

611
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,200
Sentimental centipedes do it

612
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,500
Let's do it

613
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,800
Let's fall in love

614
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,500
Mosquitoes, heaven forbid, do it

615
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,200
So does every katydid do it

616
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,500
Let's do it

617
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,400
Let's fall in love

618
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,800
The most refined

619
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,500
ladybugs do it

620
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,700
When a gentlemen calls

621
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,600
Moths in your rugs do it

622
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,800
What's the use of mothballs?

623
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,500
Locusts in trees do it

624
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,000
Bees do it

625
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,700
Even overeducated fleas do it

626
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,700
Let's do it, let's fall in love

627
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,200
Let's do it, let's fall in love

628
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:38,400
Let's do it, let's fall in love

629
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,600
Very cheeky. Excellent.

630
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,800
-That's so far.
-Listen to them.

631
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
One act down, one to go.

632
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,000
Darling, for you.

633
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,100
God, Linda.

634
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,800
Exquisite.

635
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,600
Just a little memory.

636
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,400
There are no little memories with you.

637
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,200
Patrick, you all right?

638
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,800
ls he all right doing that?
His doctors approve?

639
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,000
Probably not,
but he's got to have a childhood.

640
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,100
His sickness seems to come and go.

641
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,600
Patrick, let me give you
the key to the cartwheel.

642
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,500
lt's all mental.

643
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,100
Keep your arms straight.

644
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,000
Here comes trouble.

645
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,900
You plant it, watch this, ready?

646
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,700
And plant it like that. See?

647
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,500
Good catch.

648
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,500
l always thought so.

649
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,500
Sun-tanned, wind-blown

650
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Honeymooners at last alone

651
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,400
-You know, this was written as a duet.
-Thanks.

652
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,000
Oh, how lucky we are

653
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
While I give to you and you give to me

654
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,900
True love, true love

655
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:37,500
So on and on it will always be

656
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,800
True love, true love

657
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,500
Cole, l know this is your song,
but it just doesn't sound like you.

658
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,000
Linda thinks it does.

659
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,000
With nothing to do

660
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,100
Are you going to put it
in the new show you're working on?

661
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,500
-Why not?
-Because it doesn't sound like me.

662
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,100
Love forever true

663
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,600
Bravo!

664
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,600
Oh, my goodness,
could you be any more wonderful?

665
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,400
Come in.

666
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,300
-Hello.
-Hi.

667
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,200
l was lying in my bed just now, thinking...

668
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,300
l don't want to stay in that room.
l want to stay here tonight, is that all right?

669
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,300
Of course it is, darling.
ls everything all right?

670
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,300
Are you lonely?

671
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,300
No, l'm fine.

672
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,900
lt's just that....

673
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,800
lt's funny, this afternoon...

674
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,100
l was watching you...

675
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,500
and watching you
watching the Murphys' kids...

676
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,800
and l thought about how happy we are
and how much we have...

677
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,400
and then l thought about the Murphys
and how happy they are...

678
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,700
and l think we could be....

679
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,700
We are as happy as the Murphys,
but we could be happy in the way that...

680
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,200
the Murphys are happy
if we had what the Murphys have.

681
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,200
They bring them so much happiness.

682
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,300
l'm so glad l'm not trying
to write this as a song.

683
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,100
lt would be a beautiful serenade.

684
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,900
Champagne,
or how do you wanna play this?

685
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:12,000
Comedy, tragedy? Musical comedy, farce?

686
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,100
Why don't we just play?

687
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,200
Good idea.

688
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,600
Night and day

689
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,800
You are the one

690
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,800
Only you beneath the moon

691
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,600
And under the sun

692
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,900
Whether near to me or far

693
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,600
It's no matter, darling, where you are

694
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,100
I think--

695
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,100
Stop!

696
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,600
-lt's impossible, l just can't do it.
-Cole.

697
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,500
He is only an actor,
but he's still maybe right.

698
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,000
He's tried it seven times.
The song is a problem.

699
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,800
l told you, we should have given it
to Astaire.

700
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,700
Beard, the song is not a problem,
it's a challenge.

701
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,500
Just give me a moment.

702
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,400
Jack, dear boy...

703
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,200
what can l do to help?
Anything, just name it.

704
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,100
Write another song.

705
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,400
God, that cuts me right to the quick.

706
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,400
l know it's God-awful,
but it's the best l can do.

707
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,500
And we open in three days.

708
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:33,000
Look, Mr. Porter, the song goes
so high and so low, it is impossible.

709
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,800
lt's not impossible.
Jack, l wrote it with you in mind.

710
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,300
l know you've got it. l can sing it,
and l have a range of three notes.

711
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,000
Where did you come up with it?

712
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,800
l get all my ideas from a little Chinese man
in Poughkeepsie.

713
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:50,300
Listen, you can sing this.
The problem is, you're not having any fun.

714
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,600
Just don't think about the melody.

715
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,500
Just think about the words.
lt's about obsession.

716
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,000
lt's about being in love.

717
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,600
You've been in love?

718
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:02,100
All right, obsess about it.
Just sing it with me.

719
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,300
Think about the lyrics and just look at me.
One more time. Jimmy?

720
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:11,800
Like the beat beat beat of the tom tom

721
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,600
When the jungle shadows fall

722
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:19,900
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock

723
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:23,200
-As it stands against the wall
-lt's relentless, it's obsessive.

724
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,600
Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops

725
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,200
When the summer shower is through

726
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,900
So a voice within me keeps repeating

727
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,900
You you you

728
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,500
Night and day

729
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,600
You are the one

730
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:53,900
Only you beneath the moon

731
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,300
And under the sun

732
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,200
That's beautiful.

733
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:02,000
Whether near to me or far

734
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,900
It's no matter, darling, where you are

735
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I think of you

736
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,100
Night and day

737
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,600
Jimmy, try E flat.

738
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,100
Day and night

739
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,100
Why is it so

740
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,500
That this longing for you

741
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,300
Follows wherever I go?

742
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,600
In the roaring traffic's boom

743
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:39,400
In the silence of my lonely room

744
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,200
I think of you

745
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,100
Night and day

746
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,800
Night and day

747
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,200
Under the hide of me

748
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:59,300
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning

749
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,000
Burning inside of me

750
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,200
And this torment won't be through

751
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:11,000
Till you let me spend my life

752
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:16,000
Making love to you

753
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,200
Day and night

754
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,800
Night and day

755
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,900
Bravo.

756
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,400
I never believed in anything,
least of all myself, until Linda.

757
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,400
She restored me to myself.

758
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,800
And l gave her back...

759
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,400
me.

760
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,200
Hardly payment in kind.

761
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,800
lrving swears that The Times critic
was dancing up the aisle.

762
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,200
Our producer was still standing
in the front row, applauding.

763
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,600
No triumph complete without this.
Thank you.

764
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,500
You're welcome. Let's not be late.

765
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,600
l'm gonna ride with Monty
if it's all right with you.

766
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,200
He says the London producers
are dying to talk to me...

767
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,300
about the West End transfer.
ls it all right if l join you later?

768
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,700
Can't you speak with him at the party?

769
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,400
No business at the party, only fun.

770
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,500
-lt's all right, l'll be there soon.
-All right.

771
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,800
Bye-bye.

772
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,500
Beard, you know, you're very dear to me,
always have been...

773
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,500
but these opening night gifts of yours
are becoming more and more intricate.

774
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,400
lt's not as elegant as one of
Linda's cigarette cases, l know...

775
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,900
but l believe it may be better suited
to the daring side of your nature.

776
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,300
Monty, you've always been so solicitous
vis-à-vis my nature. You pamper me.

777
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,400
l have to, my boy. Nature is a nasty bitch.

778
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,700
lf nature were fair, l'd be Marlene Dietrich.

779
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,900
If you wake up and dream

780
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:10,500
Life will suddenly seem
as gay as it used to be

781
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,600
Never mind what they say
Let your dreams dream away

782
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,800
And you'll still be alive
when they're dead

783
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,000
Your words.

784
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,900
Yes, Monty, but it's a song,
not a call to arms.

785
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,900
Arms weren't what l had in mind.

786
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,800
l wanted to tell you privately
how much all your attention did for me.

787
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,800
And Night and Day,
how much it means to me.

788
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,800
From here on,
you two will have to improvise.

789
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,300
l'm gonna find some trouble of my own
in the Ramble.

790
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,600
Shall we have a cigarette?

791
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,500
Good morning.

792
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,900
This is something new.

793
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,600
To be inconsiderate,
to ignore your obligations.

794
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,700
l know.

795
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
l'm so sorry, l really am.
That was unforgivable.

796
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,000
Cole, you disappointed a lot of people
last night.

797
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
The London producers were there.

798
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,200
Some Hollywood people were most anxious
to speak with you.

799
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,500
l don't want to go to Hollywood,
and l don't want to fight.

800
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,400
l don't want to fight.

801
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,200
-And l don't want to blame.
-Thank you for that, dear.

802
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,400
But if things are gonna be different...

803
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,200
l'd like to know.

804
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,700
l'll tell you as soon as l know.

805
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,500
You must have known already.

806
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,000
l got the ending.

807
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,900
I didn't know how much my happiness
would hurt us.

808
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,500
We couldn't hear the songs
the same way anymore.

809
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,100
Suddenly the lyrics all sounded like code.

810
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,000
In olden days, a glimpse of stocking

811
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,900
was looked on as something shocking

812
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,600
Now heaven knows

813
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,400
Anything goes

814
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,800
Good authors, too,
who once knew better words

815
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,800
Now only use four-letter words

816
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,100
Writing prose

817
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,700
Anything goes

818
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,000
If saying your prayers you like

819
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,400
They love your song.

820
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,100
-If green pears you like
-If green pears you like

821
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,300
-If old chairs you like
-If old chairs you like

822
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,700
Don't you?

823
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,400
If backstairs you like

824
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,900
-If love affairs you like
-If love affairs you like

825
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,200
If love affairs you like

826
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,900
With young bears you like

827
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,900
Why, nobody will oppose

828
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
So though I'm not a great romancer

829
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,200
I know that I'm bound to answer

830
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,100
When you propose

831
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,400
Anything goes

832
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,300
Ellin says lrving is having
a great run in Hollywood.

833
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,800
The Gershwins are there--

834
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,600
You want me to leave
at the top of my game?

835
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,900
-If old hymns you like
-If old hymns you like

836
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,400
-If bare limbs you like
-If bare limbs you like

837
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,700
-If Mae West you like
-If Mae West you like

838
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,300
Or me undressed you like

839
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,600
l'll give this to you now in case...

840
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,200
Monty has more producers for you to visit.

841
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:41,100
The set that's smart is intruding on
nudist parties in studios

842
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,100
Anything goes

843
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,400
Anything goes

844
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,200
Anything goes

845
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,700
-By the way, do you want one?
-No, thank you.

846
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:01,000
-That's beautiful. From Linda?
-Yeah, of course, opening night.

847
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,600
Linda must be keeping Cartier in business
all by herself.

848
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,300
-She does spoil me. l don't deserve it.
-No, you probably don't.

849
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,000
Which reminds me, how's Linda?

850
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,200
She's all right.

851
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,600
A bit more fragile than usual,
but all right. How's Patrick?

852
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,600
There's a doctor in Zurich
who may give us more time.

853
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,700
They don't give you much hope
with tuberculosis.

854
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,900
So sorry.

855
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,200
Does Linda know? She hasn't said anything.

856
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,200
Yeah.

857
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,300
She said, ''We live in castles built on sand.''

858
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
l just think that life has been
one great carnival...

859
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,400
and now we're teetering on the high wire.

860
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,600
Yes, but you've got Sara to catch you,
and l have Linda.

861
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,200
Ever wonder who's there to catch them?

862
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,500
When they begin

863
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,500
The beguine

864
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,500
It brings back the sound

865
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,000
Of music so tender

866
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,600
It brings back a night

867
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,000
Of tropical splendor

868
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:27,700
It brings back a memory

869
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:31,200
evergreen

870
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:36,000
I'm with you once more

871
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:40,800
under the stars

872
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,000
And down by the shore

873
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,200
an orchestra's playing

874
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:54,100
And even the palms

875
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,900
seem to be swaying

876
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,200
When they begin

877
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,500
the beguine

878
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,300
To live it again

879
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,800
is past all endeavor

880
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,700
Except when that tune

881
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,800
clutches my heart

882
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,000
And there we are

883
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:32,700
Swearing to love forever

884
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,100
Promising never

885
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:42,700
Never to part

886
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,000
What moments divine

887
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:51,100
What rapture serene

888
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:57,300
Till clouds came along to disperse

889
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:00,100
the joys we had tasted

890
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:06,400
And now when I hear people curse

891
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,300
the chance that was wasted

892
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,500
I know but too well

893
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,800
what they mean

894
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:23,200
So don't let them begin

895
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,000
the beguine

896
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,800
Let the love that was once a fire

897
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,600
remain an ember

898
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:43,200
Let it sleep like the dead desire

899
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,200
I only remember

900
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,800
When they begin

901
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,700
the beguine

902
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:01,000
When they begin

903
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,300
the beguine

904
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:33,800
l am so terribly sorry, darling.
l know how late l must be.

905
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,000
Late?

906
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:39,400
-Linda, you missed the whole thing.
-l misplaced the cigarette case.

907
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,000
l'd rather have had you.

908
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,900
lt would have been bad luck.

909
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,200
To hell with luck.

910
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,600
This feels very wrong.
l don't like bringing up this whole thing.

911
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,000
lt happened and it was over,
and that was that.

912
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,200
We never brought it up again.

913
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,000
Finished, done.

914
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,200
Done, maybe. Finished?

915
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,800
-l won't have it.
-lt's not your choice.

916
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,400
Anyway, l hope you like it.

917
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,600
Linda, what were you thinking?

918
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,400
You wouldn't have lost it.

919
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,800
l had hoped not.

920
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,800
-What are you talking about?
-Nothing!

921
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,100
Absolutely nothing. Definitively nothing.

922
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,900
Shall we go now?

923
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,200
l would hate to compound the felony
by making us late for the party.

924
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,700
That would be terrible, dreadful.
A tragedy too great to bear.

925
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,900
God, Linda, what's happened?

926
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:45,000
Nothing, just a small thing. lt's just not like
being late or missing an opening.

927
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,600
A very small thing...

928
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,400
that stopped growing.

929
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,000
My sweet girl, l'm so sorry.

930
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:03,000
l didn't want to tell you like this.

931
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,500
l just went to the doctor,
he said l should rest, and it got so late.

932
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,200
l'm sorry.

933
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,300
l wanted it so, Cole.

934
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,200
l wanted it for us.

935
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:21,300
l know.

936
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:32,200
-l want to take you home now. All right?
-l don't want to go home.

937
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,900
l don't even feel like we have a home.

938
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,700
Then we'll find a new one.

939
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,800
We'll get out of town, we'll travel.
We'll find a new place.

940
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:44,300
Some place good for you and good for me.

941
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:50,100
lf everyone's moved to Hollywood,
then we'll go there, too. We'll try it.

942
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,000
We'll make a fresh start.

943
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,300
Let's just get the doctor in tonight,
just to make sure you're all right.

944
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,800
No more doctors.

945
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,700
l already know l'm not all right.

946
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:11,200
Linda, then it wasn't meant to be, that's all.

947
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,600
So, fine, we'll be all right.

948
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,200
We'll be just fine with what was meant to be.

949
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,900
That's you and that's me.

950
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,500
That's what was meant to be.

951
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,300
l love you, Linda Porter.

952
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,200
l love you so much.

953
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,800
-Okay, darling, don't cheat.
-lt's not in my nature to cheat.

954
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,700
All right, okay.

955
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:57,200
-All right. Ready?
-l'm ready.

956
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,300
My goodness.

957
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,700
ls it all right?

958
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,100
No, l'd like something a little bigger, please.

959
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,500
lt's Hollywood, darling,
we do things big out here.

960
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,700
This is beautiful. Look at the bow.

961
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:09,900
Richard!

962
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,000
Let me show you the inside.

963
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,500
All of Metro is proud to have you
as part of our family, Cole.

964
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,600
You said that, L.B.
Thank you, l appreciate it.

965
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,200
l wanted to tell you again,
just to be sure you know.

966
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,500
-We know you'll be happy here.
-l'm already happy.

967
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,100
Swell. That makes me happy, you're happy.

968
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,800
You know who else makes me happy?
lrving Berlin.

969
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,500
Every song lrving Berlin writes, l love.
You know why?

970
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,400
Because his songs sound like
what people who aren't clever...

971
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,600
say to each other when they're in love.
Real love songs.

972
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,300
Not clever love songs.

973
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,200
Could you write real love songs?

974
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:49,700
When you write funny songs,
l want funny-funny, not clever-funny.

975
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,500
Could you do that for me?

976
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,600
You're stronger if you're not angry.

977
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,400
Tickle their ribs as you slide in the knife.

978
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,500
Try it.

979
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,300
I'll remember forever
when I was but three

980
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:14,200
Mama, who was clever, remarking to me

981
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:18,600
If, son, when you're grown up
you want everything nice

982
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:24,000
I've got your future sewn up
if you take this advice

983
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,300
Be a clown

984
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,000
Be a clown

985
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,100
All the world loves a clown

986
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:34,100
Act the fool, play the calf

987
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:37,400
And you'll always have the last laugh

988
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:41,000
Wear the cap and the bells

989
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:44,200
And you'll rate with all the great swells

990
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,900
If you become a doctor,
folks'll face you with dread

991
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,400
And if you become a dentist,
they'll be glad when you're dead

992
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,500
You'll get a bigger hand
if you can stand on your head

993
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,800
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

994
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,000
-Be a clown
-Be a clown

995
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
-All the world
-Loves a clown

996
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:07,600
-Show 'em tricks
-Tell 'em jokes

997
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:11,000
And you'll only stop with top folks

998
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,700
Be a crack jackanapes

999
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,600
And they'll imitate you like apes

1000
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:21,200
Why be a great composer
with your rent in arrears?

1001
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:24,600
Why be a major poet
and you'll owe it for years

1002
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,600
When crowds will pay to giggle
if you wiggle your ears?

1003
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,800
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

1004
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,200
Be a clown, be a clown

1005
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:42,600
All the world loves a clown

1006
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:45,700
If you just make them roar

1007
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:49,200
Watch your mountebank account soar

1008
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,500
Wear a painted mustache

1009
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,800
And you're sure to make a big splash

1010
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:59,600
A college education I should never propose

1011
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:02,500
A bachelor's degree
won't even keep you in clothes

1012
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:05,800
But millions you will win
if you can spin on your nose

1013
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,900
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

1014
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,100
-Give 'em quips
-Give 'em quips

1015
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,700
-Give 'em fun
-Give 'em fun

1016
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,600
And they'll pay to say you're A-one

1017
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:27,300
If you become a farmer,
you've the weather to buck

1018
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:31,000
If you become a gambler,
you'll be stuck with your luck

1019
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:35,200
But, Jack, you'll never lack
if you can quack like a duck

1020
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,100
Be a clown

1021
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:45,500
Be a clown

1022
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:54,500
Be a clown

1023
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:05,800
Jesus, though, it was a relief
just to have fun and...

1024
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,900
do something trite and not care a damn...

1025
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,500
and get paid a hundred times
what you'd be paid for something good.

1026
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,600
I love you under my skin

1027
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,800
They'll never know the difference.

1028
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:23,800
What's it going to be called?

1029
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:26,400
What's the dreariest title ever?

1030
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:29,500
l bet Coley $5...

1031
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:33,500
that he could never write a song called
I Love You.

1032
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:37,800
Get your money out. l'm telling you,
Louis B. Mayer is going to love this.

1033
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,100
He's going to weep.

1034
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,100
l need a time of year. A month.

1035
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,300
-All right, April.
-June.

1036
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,700
Perfect cliché, April.

1037
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:54,700
''I love you'' hums the April breeze

1038
01:05:56,100 --> 01:06:01,300
I love you under my skin

1039
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,700
I love you

1040
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,600
Is it a sin?

1041
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,200
Certainly not.

1042
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,900
''I love you''

1043
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:17,900
hums the April breeze

1044
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:20,800
''I love you''

1045
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:23,700
Echo the hills

1046
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:27,400
''I love you''

1047
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:31,900
The golden dawn agrees

1048
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:35,400
As once more she sees

1049
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:38,000
daffodils

1050
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:42,300
It's spring again

1051
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,300
And birds on the wing again

1052
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:49,800
Start to sing again

1053
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:53,600
The old melody

1054
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:56,800
''I love you''

1055
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:00,700
That's the song of songs

1056
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:06,700
And it all belongs to you and me

1057
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,800
It was just

1058
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,100
one of those things

1059
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:31,900
Just one of those crazy flings

1060
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,900
lt's a real pearl.

1061
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:36,700
Go ahead, dear, take it.

1062
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:39,500
lt's tiny, but trust me,
it's still the biggest thing...

1063
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,800
you can get your fingers around
in this crowd.

1064
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:44,500
-You'll make big bucks on this.
-That's swell.

1065
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,700
lt's something, isn't it?

1066
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,300
Yes, it's lovely.

1067
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:53,200
lt's so imaginative to actually have the party
at the studio.

1068
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:57,500
ls absolutely everything in Hollywood
connected to movies?

1069
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:59,500
Everything good.

1070
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,200
That's why we're trying to coax Cole
into permanent residency.

1071
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,700
How would half of every year be?

1072
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
l think Hollywood's fantastic,
it's like living on the moon.

1073
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,700
Or 20,000 leagues under the sea.

1074
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:21,900
When we started painting the town

1075
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,400
Can you believe this?

1076
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:30,500
Linda, Hollywood was your idea, not mine.

1077
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,500
Now you're acting like
it's the worst place on earth.

1078
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:37,300
l had thought that the change of weather
might be good for us both.

1079
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,600
l had no idea how hot
the climate would really be.

1080
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,000
The climate is good for growing flowers.

1081
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,500
Everything grows wild, Cole.

1082
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,100
And the pickings are far too easy.

1083
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:53,000
Now and then
It was great fun

1084
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:57,400
But it was just one of those things

1085
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,000
-Mr. Porter, how are you?
-Mr. Nelson.

1086
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,200
What you did with that song
is just splendid.

1087
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:04,100
l'd love to introduce you to my wife.

1088
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,900
Cole...

1089
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,900
I hope we could coax you into a song.

1090
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,900
Be right back.

1091
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,500
-Good song.
-Thank you.

1092
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,500
There's a plan for later.

1093
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:32,600
Linda's being very prickly tonight,
but l'll try to get away.

1094
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:36,000
-Plenty of company lined up?
-Good company, l promise.

1095
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:42,600
Thank you all. This is indeed
an honor and a surprise.

1096
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,300
Obviously L.B. wants you all
to get home early...

1097
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,500
that's why he's asked me to sing.

1098
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,100
So here goes.

1099
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,300
Before you leave these portals

1100
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,600
To meet less fortunate mortals

1101
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:06,200
There's just one final message
I would give to you

1102
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,100
Now you all have learned reliance

1103
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:15,400
On the sacred teachings of science

1104
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:18,900
So I hope through life
you never will decline

1105
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,200
In spite of philistine defiance

1106
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:26,700
To do what all good scientists do

1107
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,100
Experiment

1108
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,500
Make it your motto day and night

1109
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,800
Experiment

1110
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,700
It will lead you to the light

1111
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,200
If this advice you'll only employ

1112
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:49,400
The future can offer you infinite joy

1113
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,500
And merriment

1114
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,700
Experiment

1115
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,400
And you'll see

1116
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,800
Good night.

1117
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:00,700
Thank you.

1118
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:07,600
What a marvelous song.
l don't know it, do you?

1119
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:08,800
lntimately.

1120
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,300
You seem very happy, dear.

1121
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,200
l am, darling. l wish you were.

1122
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,500
-Excuse me.
-The Springs will take care of that.

1123
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,400
l was actually thinking of going to Arizona.

1124
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,100
lt's so much further.

1125
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,500
l don't mind.

1126
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,500
l expect l'll be gone by the time
you come home.

01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:37,300
will buy?

1135
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:45,100
Who would like to sample my supply?

1136
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:53,700
Who's prepared to pay the price

1137
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:57,800
for a trip to paradise?

1138
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:01,600
Love

01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,900
for sale

1140
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:12,800
Let the poets pipe of love

1141
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,000
in their childish way

1142
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:21,300
I know every type of love

1143
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,500
better far than they

1144
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:31,000
If you want the thrill of love

1145
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:35,900
I've been through the mill of love

1146
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,500
Old love, new love

1147
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:45,600
Every love but true love

1148

01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:10,800

1151
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:15,600
follow me and climb the stairs

1152
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:21,600
Love

1153
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:28,100
for sale

1154
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,200
Aren't there always copies
of those sorts of photographs anyway?

1155
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:48,500
Cole wanted a set for himself.

1156
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:51,200
These are not
blackmail pictures, Linda, they're--

1157
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:52,300
Mrs. Porter.

1158
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,300
They were taken for recreational purposes.

1159
01:14:55,900 --> 01:15:00,300
Cole has a heedless appetite for life.
l'm sure we agree he needs to be protected.

1160
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,400
You became devoted
so very quickly, Mr. Reed.

1161
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:06,700
He is so easy to love.

1162
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:14,100
Beyond devotion, what are your ambitions?

1163
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:18,000
l have thought of my own theatrical agency.
lt would be a company that would...

1164
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:21,600
keep their clients' best interests
close to heart, always.

1165
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:23,300
As you and l do Cole's.

1166
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,800
Of course. And how many backers
do you require?

1167
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,500
Only one, Mrs. Porter.

1168
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:30,100
Just let me know how much.

1169
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
l'll leave these with you.

1170
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,500
You don't sweat, do you? Not a drop.

1171
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,700
l don't believe in wasting my resources.

1172
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:45,200
Goodbye, Linda.

1173
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:04,100
It's the wrong song in the wrong style

1174
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:07,400
Though your smile is lovely,
it's the wrong smile

1175
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:11,800
It's not her smile, but such a lovely smile

1176
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,700
But it's all right with me

1177
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,100
Welcome home.

1178
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,200
Aren't you pleased?

1179
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:24,600
-About the roses?
-Yes.

1180
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,800
They're glorious. Are they for me?

1181
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:27,900
Who else?

1182
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:29,900
One never knows.

1183
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,900
What's wrong, Linda?

1184
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:36,200
Your friend Bobby Reed
has been to see me...

1185
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,500
with his nefarious portfolio.

1186
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,100
Yes, he told me.

1187
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:43,400
-He told you?
-Yes.

1188
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,200
l paid him, too, you know.

1189
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,100
No, l didn't know.

1190
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,500
Yes, he's an ambitious fellow.

1191
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:52,800
lt's all right.

1192
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:56,100
l don't think it's all right, Cole.
l think it's disgusting.

1193
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,600
He's exploiting both of us.

1194
01:16:58,700 --> 01:16:59,800
Well, yes.

1195
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:03,400
l like to look at it as a kind of luxury tax.

1196
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,000
A luxury tax?

1197
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:10,000
What an extraordinary thing to say.

1198
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,900
Do you have any idea how much
you've changed?

1199
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,500
How much your behavior has changed?

1200
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:20,000
You have put everything that you've
accomplished with your music at risk.

1201
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,000
Darling, my work has never been better.

1202
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:25,600
lt's flourishing. Even if we're not.

1203
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:30,300
Your music comes from your talent,
not from your behavior.

1204
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:34,100
lt's all the same thing. l can't put
my talent here and my behavior here...

1205
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,600
and my eating, sleeping,
and drinking habits.

1206
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,200
lt's all me.

1207
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:40,700
l have never asked you to change.

1208
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,300
Just be discreet.

1209
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:48,500
Linda, l have never been discreet.

1210
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:53,100
What is discretion but dishonesty
wrapped up in a little good breeding?

1211
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:57,700
l don't think you want me to be discreet,
l think you want me to be different.

1212
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,300
l am partially responsible for all of this...

1213
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:04,500
because l have spoiled you,
l have indulged you.

1214
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:08,900
But so has the entire goddamned world.

1215
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,900
And for what?

1216
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,400
Just a little music.

1217
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,500
Linda hated being late for anything.
And the next day she was late for lunch.

1218
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,900
I only had to hear the clock strike...

1219
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,900
and look at her empty place at the table
to know she was gone.

1220
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,700
Gone back to Paris.

1221
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,800
It's quite simple, really.

1222
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:37,800
Two people who wanted
too much from each other.

1223
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,700
Porter residence.

1224
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,800
Hold one moment.

1225
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,300
-Sir.
-Not now.

1226
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,000
lt's urgent, sir.

1227
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,300
Yes?

1228
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:03,400
All the money, all the music
had deflected reality for so long...

1229
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:07,000
I didn't know that everything we had
was so fragile.

1230
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,900
Hold it loose, hold it tight.

1231
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,700
Everything breaks.

1232
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,500
l'm going to take them to Paris next week.

1233
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:36,900
All of this is just....

1234
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,000
Got to get back to a better place.

1235
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:43,600
And it would be good to see Linda.

1236
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,000
Morning, Cole.

1237
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:05,500
Are we the only ones up?

1238
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,600
Our hostess just retired.

1239
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,900
l've been up since 5:00.

1240
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:15,700
Writing another hit, l'm sure.

1241
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:18,000
l wish it was that easy.

1242
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:21,200
Nothing comes easy anymore.

1243
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,900
And when it does, it's lousy.

1244
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,700
l write better in my own place
or the Murphys'.

1245
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:33,000
l'm going to swear off these house parties
until l finish this score.

1246
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:35,400
Remind me l said that, will you?

1247
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,600
That melody sounds like
it could go somewhere.

1248
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,400
Yeah, like out for a drink.

1249
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,100
Have you heard from Linda?

1250
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:52,400
No.

1251
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:56,400
No. l've written, l've wired,
l've called. Nothing.

1252
01:20:57,100 --> 01:21:00,500
l'm sorry, Cole, l'm really sorry.
Maybe with time....

1253
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:04,700
lt'll take more than time.

1254
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,200
l'll be back before breakfast.

1255
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,800
Just seemed so much
to ask children to bear.

1256
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,300
How long will you stay?

1257
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,100
No idea.

1258
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,700
Let's go inside, it's getting cold.

1259
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:25,900
You see how far l'll go to get you back?

1260
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,700
l think you've gone too far this time...

1261
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:31,400
but l ought to be used to it by now.

1262
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:35,400
I'm afraid his right leg should be amputated.

1263
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:39,000
Perhaps the left as well.
There's really no alternative.

1264
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,900
lf you amputate his legs,
you will cut out his pride.

1265
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,100
You'll break his spirit,
he would never work again.

1266
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:48,500
He'll have nothing without his music,
it's the essence of him.

1267
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,200
He'd have nothing to live for.

1268
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:53,600
He would have his life, his friends, you.

1269
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:58,100
Nothing. He would just be
living out his death.

1270
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,500
You're asking a lot of him.

1271
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:06,100
We are accustomed to asking
a lot of one another.

1272
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:21,500
So what did the sawbones say?

1273
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:28,100
You get to keep the old things.
And he expects you to walk, and so do l.

1274
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,200
But only if l can walk to you.

1275
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:35,500
As far as Williamstown?

1276
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:37,100
Williamstown?

1277
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:40,500
Massachusetts. l found a very pretty home.

1278
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:44,200
It's on a hill, it has a work space.

1279
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:47,100
Thinking of buying it.

1280
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,400
A little bump.

1281
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:54,000
-All right.
-Now?

1282
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,000
A grand piano.

1283
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:01,400
That is grand.

1284
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,300
That's not quite right.

1285
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,000
So shall l leave you to it?

1286
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,300
Guess you'd better.

1287
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:51,700
God, l can't work the pedal.

1288
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:55,000
Can't work the pedals, dear.

1289
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,900
God damn it!

1290
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,600
l can't work the pedals!

1291
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,400
And what did it take...

1292
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:17,900
to finally work the pedals?

1293
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:22,400
A few years.

1294
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,100
A pharmacopoeia of pills.

1295
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:28,800
A reservoir of Scotch
and 20 more operations.

1296
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:32,400
Nonstop fun.

1297
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,300
But over time, you got five shows
up and running.

1298
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:39,600
Up? Yes. Running? Barely.

1299
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,700
At least, according to the critics.

1300
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:44,700
''Not up to Mr. Porter's usual standards''...

1301
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,100
was the refrain.

1302
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:49,800
So when Hollywood finally called again?

1303
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:53,300
l was on the train before the second ring.

1304
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:57,600
He is the same. One of Yale's sons
of whom we are all proud.

1305
01:26:58,300 --> 01:26:59,600
Cole Porter.

1306
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,500
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning

1307
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:06,100
Burning inside of me

1308
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:10,600
And its torment won't be through

1309
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:15,600
Till you let me spend my life making love

1310
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:18,700
to you

1311
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,500
Day and night

1312
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:28,400
Night and day

1313
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:37,300
lf l can survive this movie,
l can survive anything.

1314
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:40,900
And you shall, darling, beautifully,
like everything else.

1315
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Thank you.

1316
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,300
The movie will do very well,
and you'll be encouraged.

1317
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:52,100
l wonder, it seems like every time
they operate, l lose songs as well as blood.

1318
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:56,200
Remind me to call the studio and tell them
how much we ''absolutely loved the movie.''

1319
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:57,400
Naturally.

1320
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:04,200
Sorry. l'm all right.

1321
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Why on earth does Linda come back
to Cole anyway?

1322
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,800
Because he's Cary Grant.

1323
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:15,200
And she misses the music, as do l.

1324
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:19,500
l must say, going down in history
as Cary Grant is not too bad.

1325
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,700
Not for a boy from lndiana.

1326
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:24,800
We should be grateful to them,
they found us a happy ending.

1327
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:27,200
Yes, happy endings.

1328
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,700
You don't get many of those,
do you, in Hollywood?

1329
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:36,600
So this promises what, surgery number 25?

1330
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:37,900
Twenty-six.

1331
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,500
Good God. And how long will l have
to wear the cast this time?

1332
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:44,600
A few months, we'll see how you mend.

1333
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,600
What's that?

1334
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:52,900
lt's Linda.

1335
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,800
lt's gotten that bad, then?

1336
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:07,200
Even if she'd agree,
l don't think surgery would help.

1337
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,300
The lungs are too damaged.

1338
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:19,500
Dr. Moorhead, are you saying that
Linda is dying?

1339
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,800
God, what a swell party this is.

1340
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:17,300
Four weeks, you rehearse and rehearse

1341
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,500
Three weeks, and it couldn't be worse

1342
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,400
One week, will it ever be right?

1343
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:26,400
Then out of the hat, it's that big first night

1344
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:29,500
The overture is about to start

1345
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:32,900
You cross your fingers and hold your heart

1346
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,300
It's curtain time and off we go

1347
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:39,900
Another opening of another show

1348
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:45,300
Miss Morrison, the line is ''away we go,''
not ''off we go,'' dear.

1349
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:47,600
You couldn't manage to make me
hear you before...

1350
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:50,700
and now that l can hear you,
you've got it wrong.

1351
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:54,900
So shall we do it again?
Let's pick it up, dust it off, and get it right.

1352
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,400
The tempo was good.

1353
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:02,100
All right, everyone, let's go.

1354
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:07,200
One week, will it ever be right?

1355
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:10,600
Then out of the hat, it's that big first night

1356
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:13,400
The overture is about to start

1357
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:17,300
You cross your fingers and hold your heart

1358
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:22,500
It's curtain time and away we go

1359
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:26,700
Another opening

1360
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:32,700
Just another opening of another show

1361
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:39,700
Very good. Thank you, all.

1362
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,300
Carry on. And chorus...

1363
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:53,200
keep those consonants crisp.

1364
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:58,500
The audience shouldn't think you're saying,
''An annoying opening for an ugly show.''

1365
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:01,500
Let them come to that conclusion
on their own.

1366
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:22,800
Please stop that knocking.

1367
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,900
-Mr. Porter.
-What?

1368
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,800
Your wife sent me to fetch you.

1369
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,500
Fetch me for what?

1370
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:33,100
-For tea.
-l don't like tea.

1371
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,200
lt's just a few steps. She's waiting.

1372
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:41,900
Fine, come in. Fetch me, for Christ's sake.

1373
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,900
-Who are you, anyway?
-Bill, Bill Wrather.

1374
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:51,000
Bill rather? Rather what?

1375
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:57,500
Bill Wrather. Yes, you're Linda's...

1376
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:02,200
-decorating wizard. Yes.
-lt's a great pleasure for me, Mr. Porter.

1377
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:04,100
The pleasure is mine.

1378
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:05,600
-Can l?
-No.

1379
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:08,100
-Are you sure?
-No. Lots of practice.

1380
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,700
l will take an arm, actually. Thank you.

1381
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:21,900
Well, l'll be making my way.

1382
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Linda, a pleasure as always.

1383
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,300
lndeed.

1384
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,000
l'll see you soon.

1385
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:30,500
Cole, that tune you were playing
was just beautiful.

1386
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,800
l can't wait to hear that in the show.

1387
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:34,700
-Goodbye now.
-Safe drive.

1388
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:40,500
-lsn't he delightful?
-Lovely.

1389
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,900
We've become such fast friends.

1390
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,400
l was hoping that you might as well.

1391
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:50,500
He'd be a good companion for you.

1392
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Linda?

1393
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:56,600
l don't want you to be lonely.

1394
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,600
l'm worried about you.

1395
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:07,200
You don't need to worry about me
or your show, it's all taken care of.

1396
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,600
l'm in God's hands, the show is in yours.

1397
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:14,100
l do wish it were
the other way round, though.

1398
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:17,600
Give me that cigarette.

1399
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:53,500
Strange, dear

1400
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:56,100
But true, dear

1401
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:03,900
When I'm close to you, dear

1402
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:10,400
The stars fill the sky

1403
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:17,500
This really needs a proper singer.
l really can't do it justice.

1404
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:21,000
Wait till opening night, hear it sung well.

1405
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:23,900
l think it sounds fine right now.

1406
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:27,300
And l won't be there, dear.

1407
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:30,600
What are you talking about?
Why wouldn't you be?

1408
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,700
You know the doctors, honey,
they're so boring.

1409
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:39,300
l don't think l would add very much to it.

1410
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:41,700
l'm sure it will be a great occasion.

1411
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:45,200
lt won't be any occasion if you're not there.

1412
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:49,100
Darling, Bill will be with you.

1413
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:51,500
He'll help you.

1414
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:57,200
l wrote this for you. What's the point
of doing it if you're not gonna be there?

1415
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:00,000
Well, that's why l want you to play it for me.

1416
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:01,700
All the way through.

1417
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:07,400
All right.

1418
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,700
l won't do it justice, but l'll do it.

1419
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:19,200
Strange, dear, but true, dear

1420
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:25,300
When I'm close to you, dear

1421
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:31,600
The stars fill the sky

1422
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:37,500
So in love with you am I

1423
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:45,000
Even without you

1424
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:50,900
My arms fold about you

1425
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:56,800
You know, darling, why

1426
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:03,200
So in love with you am I

1427
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:10,900
In love with the night mysterious

1428
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:16,500
The night when you first were there

1429
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:21,900
In love with my joy delirious

1430
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:24,000
-Wait.
-Are you all right?

1431
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:27,000
A few people may have been carried
out of my shows...

1432
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:29,500
but no one's ever been carried in.

1433
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:36,100
So taunt me and hurt me

1434
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:43,000
Deceive me, desert me

1435
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:49,500
I'm yours till I die

1436
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:53,900
So in love

1437
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,800
So in love

1438
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,800
So in love with you, my love

1439
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:04,400
Think of Linda a little and applaud a lot.

1440
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:13,400
In love with the night mysterious

1441
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:18,000
The night when you first were there

1442
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:25,700
In love with my joy delirious

1443
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:31,000
When I knew that you could care

1444
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:35,900
So taunt me

1445
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,300
And hurt me

1446
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,400
Deceive me

1447
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:45,900
Desert me

1448
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:50,400
I'm yours till I die

1449
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:54,900
So in love

1450
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:57,600
So in love

1451
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:02,600
So in love with you

1452
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:06,600
my love, am I

1453
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:13,500
In love with the night mysterious

1454
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:19,700
The night when you first were there

1455
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:26,700
In love with my joy delirious

1456
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:32,500
When I knew that you could care

1457
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,900
So taunt me

1458
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,200
And hurt me

1459
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:44,300
Deceive me

1460
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,500
Desert me

1461
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:52,300
I'm yours till I die

1462
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,800
So in love

1463
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,200
So in love

1464
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:06,300
So in love

1465
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:12,000
my love

1466
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:17,300
am I

1467
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:29,700
Bravo!

1468
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,900
Sorry, we have to move on.

1469
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,500
Please, let me enjoy this.

1470
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:41,600
lt took two years to get the backers
interested in this show.

1471
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:45,400
No one wanted anything to do with it,
they thought l was finished.

1472
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:47,300
We have to move on.

1473
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:53,700
Very well.

1474
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:43,800
We make quite a pair, don't we?

1475
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:48,400
We're still les colporteurs of Paris.

1476
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:50,400
Plying our humble trade.

1477
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,900
l could hear the score.

1478
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:57,800
Darling, it's giddy.

1479
01:42:57,800 --> 01:42:59,600
lt's all about Paris.

1480
01:42:59,900 --> 01:43:02,000
Brings back fond memories.

1481
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:08,300
-Those were fine days.
-Yes, they were.

1482
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:11,100
-And we were fine.
-We were fine.

1483
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:13,900
Finding each other.

1484
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,800
Taking care of each other.

1485
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,800
l have a little something for you.

1486
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:26,100
lt's a whole new flower.

1487
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:29,100
A gentleman in Spain did it up for me.

1488
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:31,900
lt's a hybrid of two varieties of rose...

1489
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,300
thought to be completely incompatible.

1490
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,800
Yet look at it, it's perfect.

1491
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:40,200
The Linda Porter rose.

1492
01:43:46,100 --> 01:43:47,300
Exquisite.

1493
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:52,800
lt's just a pale reflection of our life together.

1494
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:57,300
lt wasn't all beautiful.

1495
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:04,400
You were always my life to be.

1496
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:10,500
-l remember that song.
-lt was about you.

1497
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
They were all about you.

1498
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,300
Not all of them.

1499
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,500
But some, l hope.

1500
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:25,500
How l have loved you, Cole.

1501
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:36,500
l don't know how much longer l can stay.

1502
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,100
Would you mind terribly if l went
just a little early?

1503
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:09,700
Every time

1504
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:13,400
we say goodbye

1505
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:18,400
I die a little

1506
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,300
Every time

1507
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,800
we say goodbye

1508
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:30,800
I wonder why a little

1509
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:36,100
Why the gods above me

1510
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:41,800
who must be in the know

1511
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:48,300
Think so little of me

1512
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:53,800
they allow you to go

1513
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:59,800
When you're near

1514
01:45:59,900 --> 01:46:03,200
there's such an air

1515
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:07,700
of spring about it

1516
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:11,500
I can hear

1517
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:15,500
a lark somewhere

1518
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:20,200
begin to sing about it

1519
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:25,200
There's no love song finer

1520
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:29,500
But how strange the change

1521
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:34,600
from major to minor

1522
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:41,600
Every time

1523
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:45,500
we say

1524
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:49,400
goodbye

1525
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:58,300
Goodbye

1526
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:15,100
Sara.

1527
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:18,200
Hello, darling.

1528
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:21,600
Gerald.

1529
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:24,300
How is he?

1530
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:26,500
Cole is already seated.

1531
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:29,400
He doesn't want anyone
to feel awkward about the leg.

1532
01:47:29,900 --> 01:47:33,100
He would still have the damn thing
if Linda were here.

1533
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:37,300
And Monty was by for a visit.
He asked to be remembered, of course.

1534
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:38,700
Good old Monty.

1535
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Noted.

1536
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:47,800
So, Cole, when are we gonna
get another lyric from you?

1537
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:53,500
l haven't the wit nor the will
to write any more.

1538
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:57,300
Cole, you can write from everything
you remember.

1539
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:59,400
You've had the most fascinating life.

1540
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:00,600
Sara.

1541
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:02,500
Memories.

1542
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,300
lt's like the phantom pains l get
in my missing leg.

1543
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:11,200
They're not real and they hurt too much.

1544
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:16,200
l'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop.

1545
01:48:16,300 --> 01:48:18,800
Cole, please. Don't.

1546
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:20,400
Oh, my God.

1547
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
My dear friends, l'm boring you.

1548
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Let us repair to the living room
for some goodbyes...

1549
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:32,000
and some coffee
and some traveling music, shall we?

1550
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:36,800
Bill is all packed,
and you all have a long drive ahead of you.

1551
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:39,500
The invitation was for the weekend.

1552
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:42,500
Let's pretend it's Sunday.

1553
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:46,300
We'll be right there.

1554
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:49,000
-Sara.
-All right, dear.

1555
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:03,000
l wish you'd let me stay with you, Cole.
l want to stay.

1556
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:09,600
Bill, please, let me at least
try to do something noble, all right?

1557
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:11,800
What l'm trying to do is best for both of us.

1558
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:14,700
Then can't both of us decide, not just you?

1559
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:21,300
My sweet boy, there's nothing for you here.

1560
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:24,800
Come on now, get the wheelchair.

1561
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:30,000
It's the wrong time

1562
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:34,000
and the wrong place

1563
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:38,300
Though your face is charming

1564
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:40,800
it's the wrong face

1565
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:44,100
It's not her face

1566
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:48,100
That was evil. l'm sorry.

1567
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:53,500
l think you're trying very hard to misbehave.

1568
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:06,200
-And you used to be a better actor.
-l used to be better at a lot of things.

1569
01:50:08,300 --> 01:50:11,400
At words poetic, I'm so pathetic

1570
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:16,800
That I always have found it best
Instead of getting them off my chest

1571
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:20,400
To let them rest, unexpressed

1572
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:25,800
You're the top

1573
01:50:28,700 --> 01:50:31,400
You're the Coliseum

1574
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:33,900
You're the top

1575
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,600
Go on, get out of here.

1576
01:50:47,300 --> 01:50:48,600
Get outta town

1577
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:49,700
Cole, by all means--

1578
01:50:49,700 --> 01:50:52,600
Before it's too late, my love

1579
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:54,700
Take it easy, old friend.

1580
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:56,100
Get outta town

1581
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:59,400
Be good to me please

1582
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:04,100
Why wish me harm?

1583
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:05,200
Take care of him.

1584
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:07,700
Why not retire to a farm

1585
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:11,800
and be contented to charm

1586
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:16,100
the birds off the trees?

1587
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:17,300
We love you.

1588
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:35,300
It's done

1589
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:39,200
The little dream, it's done

1590
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:47,100
So bid me a fond farewell
we both had our fun

1591
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:50,300
Cole.

1592
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:55,600
Was it Romeo or Juliet who said

1593
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:58,800
when about to die

1594
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:03,600
''Love is not all peaches and cream''

1595
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:08,600
Little dream

1596
01:52:08,700 --> 01:52:11,000
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1597
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,600
Goodbye

1598
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:42,100
Lonely, miserable, melancholy

1599
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,900
What a perfect musical finale.

1600
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:47,400
Don't worry.

1601
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:51,500
Never open on a ballad,
never end on one either.

1602
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:57,300
-Do you hear that playing?
-Yes, we hear that playing

1603
01:52:58,100 --> 01:53:01,500
-Do you know who's playing?
-No, who is that playing?

1604
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:05,700
Well it's Gabriel, Gabriel playing
Gabriel, Gabriel saying

1605
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:09,200
''Will you be ready to go
when I blow my horn?''

1606
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:13,000
Oh, blow, Gabriel blow

1607
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:17,600
Go on and blow, Gabriel, blow

1608
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:20,200
I've been a sinner, I've been a scamp

1609
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:25,600
But now I'm willing to trim my lamp
So blow, Gabriel, blow

1610
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:29,800
Oh, I was low, Gabriel, low

1611
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:33,400
Mighty low, Gabriel, low

1612
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:38,700
But now since I have seen the light
I'm good by day and I'm good by night

1613
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:41,800
So blow, Gabriel, blow

1614
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:46,700
Go on and blow, Gabriel, blow

1615
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:49,400
I want to join your happy band

1616
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:54,500
And play all day in the Promised Land
So blow, Gabriel, blow

1617
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:58,400
Blow, Gabriel, blow

1618
01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:02,600
Blow, Gabriel, blow

1619
01:54:04,100 --> 01:54:08,400
Blow, Gabriel, blow

1620
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:12,100
Blow Gabriel, blow, blow, blow

1621
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:16,400
I want to join your happy band
And play all day in the Promised Land

1622
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:20,700
So blow, Gabriel, blow

1623
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:25,000
Blow, Gabriel, blow

1624
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:30,100
Blow, Gabriel, blow

1625
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:04,500
In the still of the night

1626
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:10,700
As I gaze from my window

1627
01:56:13,700 --> 01:56:16,300
at the moon in its flight

1628
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,300
My thoughts all stray to you

1629
01:56:25,100 --> 01:56:28,600
In the still of the night

1630
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:34,800
While the world is in slumber

1631
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:40,200
Oh, the times without number

1632
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:43,700
Darling, when I say to you

1633
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:54,200
''Do you love me

1634
01:56:55,700 --> 01:56:59,600
''as I love you?

1635
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:05,400
''Are you my life to be

1636
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:11,200
''my dream come true?''

1637
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:16,100
Or will this dream of mine

1638
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:20,200
fade out of sight

1639
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:23,500
Like the moon

1640
01:57:24,700 --> 01:57:28,700
growing dim on the rim

1641
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:34,100
of the hill, in the chill

1642
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:40,800
still of the night?

1643
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:49,500
Like the moon

1644
01:57:51,100 --> 01:57:55,300
growing dim on the rim

1645
01:57:57,400 --> 01:58:02,300
of the hill, in the chill

1646
01:58:05,600 --> 01:58:10,600
still of the night?
