1
00:03:09,202 --> 00:03:10,066
Good morning.

2
00:03:10,337 --> 00:03:11,634
You lie to me!

3
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:14,234
It's not the first time anymore.

4
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:17,571
Last week the property transaction
was more than $400,000.

5
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:19,305
True?

6
00:03:19,646 --> 00:03:21,136
And?

7
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:31,551
I've expected you
to know the other $300,000.

8
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:34,082
I'll transfer to you anyway.

9
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:38,658
You know I must check,
why do you try to play tricks?

10
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,200
You're a smart girl!

11
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:46,738
But in a case I've played some tricks on,
and you'll never know.

12
00:03:47,908 --> 00:03:50,206
Kelvin's case, $500,000.

13
00:03:50,744 --> 00:03:52,336
Anyway, I'll give you a share.

14
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,472
As our 5th Anniversary gift. Like it?

15
00:03:57,684 --> 00:04:00,847
It's very difficult for you
to find a husband as honest as me.

16
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:17,262
Hello, yes! Don't panic,
I think the market is good.

17
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:20,235
I think I can't make it. Mr. Chu.

18
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:24,070
Hi, good morning!

19
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:27,069
Today is really nice.

20
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:32,810
I'd just finished an American breakfast
with my wife downstairs.

21
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:38,520
- That's why we come to visit you!
- Yeah...

22
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:43,390
Good business?

23
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:49,458
Have you received
that 10 million dollars yet?

24
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:58,106
Go home first, alright?

25
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:07,215
I'll wait for your call.

26
00:05:39,486 --> 00:05:41,181
Please wait...

27
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:48,860
Wait.

28
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:51,195
Good morning.

29
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:54,092
Mrs. Yau, they are waiting for you
in the meeting.

30
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:55,724
I know it.

31
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:58,702
Ha...someone sent you flowers.

32
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,300
Who sent it?

33
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:02,635
I don't know.

34
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:05,611
Do you know who is the father?

35
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:08,043
I know, it's my husband!

36
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:11,376
It's really put yourself to hell
to have baby in these days!

37
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:15,248
OK, meeting adjourn! Let's continue
to make money for the company.

38
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:17,681
The meeting is over yet?

39
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:19,449
We've waited for you for an hour already!

40
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:22,357
It's not over yet,
I've a case to discuss with your guys.

41
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:29,968
I'll take care of the Chung Chi's case.

42
00:06:32,305 --> 00:06:33,897
Only if we give them
3 million dollars bribe money.

43
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,735
Then they will give us
all confidential documents.

44
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:38,901
I've decided to give this case to Roy.

45
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:42,640
Give it to him! Are you sure?

46
00:06:42,782 --> 00:06:45,683
I've my acquaintance in Chung Chi,
I'll win this case definitely.

47
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:47,082
Save your trouble,

48
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:50,054
I've just confirmed the deal
with the chairman of Chung Chi.

49
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,780
Who do you know?

50
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:54,325
The one who handle rubbish
or the one who clean the toilet?

51
00:06:55,795 --> 00:06:57,592
Why are you so eager to grab every case?

52
00:06:58,198 --> 00:06:59,392
Let me ask you,

53
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:02,957
how many cases
have you won these 6 months?

54
00:07:03,103 --> 00:07:04,627
Do you know your own record?

55
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:07,465
Zero! It's zero!

56
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:11,068
You're in bad luck,
why don't you take a vacation?

57
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:16,176
I just come to inform you,
I'll take care of everything.

58
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:18,179
I'm not trying to solicited the job.

59
00:07:18,518 --> 00:07:19,815
It's company business,

60
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,217
we cannot transfer it between us.

61
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:25,289
It's from here, by brainstorming!

62
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:26,619
Let me ask you guys,

63
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,853
who makes the most profit
for the company?

64
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:35,223
Boss, I begin to question your judgement!

65
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:37,728
Oh yeah, you said
you'll have your vacation before retired,

66
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:39,668
how come you're still in the office?

67
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:42,397
Boss, are you OK?

68
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:43,736
Boss...

69
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:51,249
What makes you so angry?

70
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,611
It's personal matters!

71
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:04,760
What's the matter? You haven't made love
with your husband, have you?

72
00:08:05,498 --> 00:08:07,090
It's not your business!

73
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:10,332
Don't you like man to send you flowers?

74
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,763
I don't like man-playing tricks.

75
00:08:14,274 --> 00:08:15,764
This is my style.

76
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:20,739
The stronger the woman,
the more I want to push her down...

77
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:23,438
To see how she behaves in bed.

78
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:28,819
You're disgusting.

79
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:31,081
I'm more disgusting than you may expect.

80
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,551
I want you teach him a lesson.

81
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:44,332
Here is the toilet.

82
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:45,936
I know.

83
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:01,549
You got to wash your hands and face
in the washroom.

84
00:09:10,263 --> 00:09:14,063
Mr. Yau, I just come to let you know,
this is my last day!

85
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:16,259
Do you feel
there's no prospect in this office?

86
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:17,666
No...

87
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:24,498
Thank you, Mr. Yau.

88
00:09:24,644 --> 00:09:26,839
Young man ought to
see more about the world.

89
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,574
Leave me your telephone number.

90
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:31,342
- When you're rich, give me a treat.
- Sure...

91
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:39,323
- Mr. Yau.
- Go back to work.

92
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,492
Attorney Lau...

93
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:51,035
I've found what you asked me to get.

94
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,764
I've found the paper
with doctor's signature.

95
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:55,169
See where is it...

96
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:59,611
This and these are other documents.

97
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:03,739
My sisters said, you'd have lucky money
before proceeding to court.

98
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:09,788
This is three hundred.
It should be alright, shouldn't it?

99
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:17,719
Call for the first defendant
Chan Ngan Sun.

100
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:24,493
Regarding this patient Yu Ping Wah
was injected with...

101
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:26,036
wrong medicine and causing paralyzed.

102
00:10:26,172 --> 00:10:29,664
With my deepest regret to his family
on behalf of the hospital.

103
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:33,404
And I hereby
declared as a practicing doctor.

104
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:36,140
I've not signed any such authorization,

105
00:10:36,316 --> 00:10:39,808
and I've not given any hints
to Madam Ma to give injection.

106
00:10:39,953 --> 00:10:43,150
I've worked in this hospital
for 13 years.

107
00:10:44,657 --> 00:10:46,648
And my principle is:

108
00:10:47,193 --> 00:10:51,493
More job, more mistakes; less job,
less mistakes; no job, no mistake,

109
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:55,530
so how would I bother to
give injection to the patient?

110
00:10:55,635 --> 00:10:56,624
If you didn't give me the authorization,

111
00:10:56,703 --> 00:10:58,193
I'd not have done such thing!

112
00:10:58,371 --> 00:10:59,861
According to the record
from the hospital.

113
00:11:00,006 --> 00:11:02,566
You've been complaint
by patients' families,

114
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:05,209
for 18 times in these 13 years,

115
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:08,072
including your bad attitude,
yelled at patients,

116
00:11:08,314 --> 00:11:11,613
stole their food.

117
00:11:11,684 --> 00:11:14,175
And watched TV in the private wards,

118
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:17,448
and to smoke during your shift.

119
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:19,647
According to these evident,

120
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:22,459
it is proven that the defendant
is not just a heartless...

121
00:11:22,595 --> 00:11:26,497
but also and irresponsible nurse.

122
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:30,596
So, it is not surprising
we accuse the second defendant...

123
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:32,737
of misinjection.

124
00:11:35,908 --> 00:11:37,307
Why don't you talk about something nice?

125
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,910
Many patients have come to visit me
after they left the hospital.

126
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:41,207
They also bought me lots of food.

127
00:11:41,381 --> 00:11:43,076
The defendant please control yourself.

128
00:11:43,182 --> 00:11:45,082
Sorry, but I've evidences.

129
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:46,946
I've got the authorization
with Dr. Chan's signature,

130
00:11:47,086 --> 00:11:49,884
I've got it!

131
00:11:50,757 --> 00:11:52,054
Attorney Lau.

132
00:11:56,462 --> 00:11:58,157
Here are the documents
presented to the court,

133
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:00,026
but there is no such document!

134
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:04,465
No? How come? Attorney Lau.

135
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:08,230
It's not true! I've given you by hand
just at the entrance!

136
00:12:08,374 --> 00:12:10,467
I really have such document.

137
00:12:10,643 --> 00:12:11,940
My verdict is:

138
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:14,478
the first defendant
Chan Ngan Sun is not acquitted,

139
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:17,138
and the second defendant
Ma Mei Chun is quality.

140
00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:20,911
I sentenced her
to pay $400,000 as compensation.

141
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:28,985
Attorney Lau...

142
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:34,732
- Thank you very much.
- Don't mention it.

143
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:36,295
I've got your cheque already.

144
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:38,427
But remember to be careful the next time.

145
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:40,105
OK...thank you.

146
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:42,130
Why do you keep it? Burn it!

147
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:46,268
OK...Burn it...

148
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:47,743
Bitch...

149
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:51,174
Bitch...Damn you...

150
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,842
- Claim down.
- Get lost!

151
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:55,643
You make me lose everything!

152
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:02,952
Bitch, don't let me see you again!

153
00:13:03,162 --> 00:13:04,561
Or else you must die!

154
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,963
A tooth for a tooth, an eye for an eye!

155
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:53,673
You said you're going to
have lunch with my wife?

156
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:16,096
What is the 10 million US dollars
mentioned by my hubby this morning?

157
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:20,432
Haven't I told you not to be fussy?

158
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:38,313
OK! lt'll be alright!

159
00:14:38,457 --> 00:14:41,255
Anyway, I'll give him more pressure
in the court tomorrow.

160
00:14:42,328 --> 00:14:45,126
I've your money,
of course I know what to do.

161
00:14:45,264 --> 00:14:47,960
OK, trust me. Bye!

162
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,511
What are you doing?
Looking for something?

163
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:11,021
You've taken my 10 million,
haven't you?

164
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:13,957
I've tried to
give you a chance this morning.

165
00:15:14,093 --> 00:15:18,291
I thought you'd be honest to me
about the money,

166
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:21,527
but you didn't, you even lied to me.

167
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:24,566
You're really cunning.

168
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:27,536
You helped the Thai
to wash the black money?

169
00:15:27,673 --> 00:15:30,164
Even up to 10 million US dollars?

170
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:36,145
Give me just half million
as anniversary gift?

171
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:38,115
Thank you!

172
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:42,285
To be honest. How much more
are you trying to hide from me?

173
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:44,879
So, this 10 million will be mine,

174
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:46,285
as a compensation.

175
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:50,625
Do you know
how important this money is to me!

176
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:53,891
The Thai is not ordinary guy,
they'll kill me.

177
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:58,166
I guess you don't want me to be killed.
We're still a couple, right?

178
00:15:58,237 --> 00:15:59,431
Couple?

179
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:05,634
Do you remember
the last time you sleep with me?

180
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:07,244
Have you tried to treat me as your wife?

181
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:08,836
Couple should sleep in separate rooms!

182
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:10,245
I don't even have the key to your room!

183
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:12,783
I almost forgot how your dick looks like!

184
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:14,876
Guess I have to ask Chu's wife.

185
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:15,885
She knows it better!

186
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:17,411
- Have you finished yet?
- No!

187
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,881
OK! I've slept with other woman,

188
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:21,253
and not just one, alright?

189
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:23,522
Why don't you look at yourself?
Do you expect me to sleep with you?

190
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:35,103
What do you want me to do?

191
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,672
Come on! Hit me!

192
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:42,742
Shoot me! Come on! Shoot me!

193
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,880
I don't think you have the guts to do it!

194
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:47,412
Do you know what you're good at?

195
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:50,683
Cheat woman's money
and cozy woman to bed!

196
00:16:51,057 --> 00:16:54,458
You looked pale
when I mentioned the Thai!

197
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,255
Son of a bitch!

198
00:16:58,197 --> 00:16:59,994
Come on! Kill me!

199
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:05,266
If you can't, I'll go!

200
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:10,602
I don't want this 10 million!

201
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:12,335
I call the police
and tell them everything, damn you!

202
00:17:57,556 --> 00:17:59,148
Hello. May I speak to Fan Shu Hung?

203
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:01,617
I'm Mr. Yau.

204
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:05,161
Well, I want to see you.

205
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:08,489
You're alone?

206
00:18:08,968 --> 00:18:12,267
Well, I've something to talk to you.

207
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:16,206
You know my address, don't you?

208
00:18:17,476 --> 00:18:19,467
OK, see you later!

209
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,590
Mr. Yau, what is it so urgent?

210
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:35,123
Please come in!

211
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:08,017
I had lots of thing to do in the office,

212
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:09,626
so I was home late.

213
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:12,860
When I opened the door,
I heard my wife shout upstairs.

214
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:17,301
I didn't know what's happening.
I saw her run down...

215
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:21,496
Mr. Yau, is this modern art?

216
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,607
Isn't it expensive?

217
00:19:23,742 --> 00:19:25,642
Sorry! Go on!

218
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,379
Where am I?

219
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:32,642
I heard my wife from upstairs. Oh no!

220
00:19:32,818 --> 00:19:36,310
She ran down and rushed to the door.

221
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:39,752
I saw her hand with a gun.

222
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:41,620
I didn't know why we fight together,

223
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:44,821
anyway, I...Got her gun. I shot her.

224
00:19:44,997 --> 00:19:46,487
Have you learned Karate?

225
00:19:46,932 --> 00:19:49,730
I've too! Go on!

226
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,435
I've learned Karate,
but that was long ago.

227
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:01,845
Sir, the woman is still alive.

228
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:12,010
The patient got a shot in the forehead.

229
00:21:12,151 --> 00:21:14,745
The bullet got through
the brain nervous system.

230
00:21:14,954 --> 00:21:16,649
This thief is really cold-blooded.

231
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:30,767
Where am I up to?

232
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:35,630
Oh yeah, it is Pathology,

233
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:38,800
caused by the bursting of blood vessel,

234
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:42,038
and blocked the circular system
in the brain.

235
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:47,782
If it is just a temporary lack of oxygen,

236
00:21:47,953 --> 00:21:51,548
it won't cause any permanent disability.

237
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:56,286
But, Mr. Yau
I hope you will get prepared.

238
00:21:57,563 --> 00:21:59,861
Your wife may become coma.

239
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:04,131
Dr. Lee, I don't care how much money,

240
00:22:04,303 --> 00:22:05,531
you must cure my wife.

241
00:22:05,671 --> 00:22:07,662
"INTENSIVE CARE WARD"

242
00:22:36,902 --> 00:22:38,301
Sorry!

243
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:47,234
Sorry! You know I don't want it.

244
00:22:48,747 --> 00:22:50,840
You're my wife,
we've married for so long.

245
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:52,916
How will I hurt you?

246
00:22:54,253 --> 00:22:57,450
But don't provoke me,
you can't put me to test.

247
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:06,023
Anyway, it's over, let's forget it!

248
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,667
Please tell me where you hide the money.

249
00:23:11,437 --> 00:23:15,931
The money is very important to me!
You don't want me to be killed.

250
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,205
Where is the money?

251
00:23:24,116 --> 00:23:27,916
Don't pretend,
I know you hear what I'm saying.

252
00:24:06,725 --> 00:24:11,321
Call Dr. Lee immediately.
Let's rush to see her!

253
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:37,111
OK, please tell Mr. Naichai,
I'll go to Bangkok tomorrow.

254
00:24:37,222 --> 00:24:40,316
I'll explain to him.

255
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,752
OK!

256
00:24:53,438 --> 00:24:55,838
- Please give this report to Dr. Wu.
- Yes!

257
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:14,688
This patient in the ward
has been unconscious for several weeks.

258
00:25:14,793 --> 00:25:18,285
You may come to
exercise her legs and arms!

259
00:25:18,397 --> 00:25:21,889
You're almost the Nurse-in-chief
in your previous hospital.

260
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,091
You ought to know how to do!

261
00:25:27,105 --> 00:25:29,403
I'll leave this to you, I'm leaving.

262
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:37,839
Hello, aren't you dead?

263
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:42,816
God! So young!

264
00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:45,580
I help you to exercise!

265
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:47,381
Come on!

266
00:26:02,307 --> 00:26:03,797
You bitch!

267
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:06,239
You made me lose my position,

268
00:26:06,378 --> 00:26:07,970
and made me lose my job,

269
00:26:08,614 --> 00:26:12,607
and have to listen to people's order!
Go to hell!

270
00:26:30,035 --> 00:26:34,028
Bitch! I must kill you!

271
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:00,928
Shut up.

272
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,303
How strange, she shouldn't be awake.

273
00:27:14,446 --> 00:27:16,141
Quick! Call her husband.

274
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:17,511
Her husband is not in Hong Kong.

275
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,219
Miss Ma, how did you wake her up?

276
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:27,083
I...I told her to get up...

277
00:27:27,192 --> 00:27:30,093
and enter the Miss Hong Kong Pageant.

278
00:27:30,228 --> 00:27:31,627
Then...then she become conscious!

279
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:36,423
Oh! Don't bite me!

280
00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:37,900
Stop...

281
00:27:44,343 --> 00:27:46,334
I said, "stop", and she'll stop.

282
00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:48,840
But you can't speak in Mandarin "stop",

283
00:27:48,947 --> 00:27:52,348
she won't stop, you have to say "Stop!".

284
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:54,615
Mrs. Yau, please have a seat!

285
00:28:00,826 --> 00:28:05,092
Stop...

286
00:28:05,297 --> 00:28:06,321
Why don't you remember what I told you?

287
00:28:06,465 --> 00:28:07,261
See what have you done?

288
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:09,457
You wanna ruin yourself.

289
00:28:19,811 --> 00:28:22,905
Delicious...

290
00:28:26,952 --> 00:28:28,442
It's really delicious.

291
00:28:56,848 --> 00:28:58,247
How are you?

292
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:02,115
That's right. Take the medicine!

293
00:29:02,254 --> 00:29:03,551
And you'll regain your memory.

294
00:29:03,688 --> 00:29:05,918
Drink the water! Drink it!

295
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:28,002
I made the promise before I went abroad,
of course I can do it!

296
00:29:28,814 --> 00:29:30,907
I even went to Thailand
and explain it to you.

297
00:29:36,521 --> 00:29:38,512
Why are you so mysterious?
Haven't I seen you for 2 weeks.

298
00:29:38,623 --> 00:29:40,318
Where have you been?

299
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,260
My husband told me
you're not doing so well lately.

300
00:29:44,663 --> 00:29:45,857
Do you need any help?

301
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,360
My husband also said...

302
00:29:50,602 --> 00:29:51,899
Have you said enough?

303
00:29:52,804 --> 00:29:54,999
You've been talking about your husband
since you came up.

304
00:29:55,707 --> 00:29:57,197
What's so special about him?

305
00:29:59,578 --> 00:30:01,273
He's just a dog.

306
00:30:01,947 --> 00:30:03,847
One of my dogs!

307
00:30:15,894 --> 00:30:20,797
Oh, I'm sorry,
I won't dare, don't get mad!

308
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,202
I won't mention him again!

309
00:30:27,906 --> 00:30:29,100
Do you want?

310
00:30:43,221 --> 00:30:47,317
Don't, it's bad luck
if we do it in the office.

311
00:30:57,202 --> 00:30:58,499
Hello, yes, who's calling?

312
00:31:00,138 --> 00:31:03,596
Pardon?

313
00:31:04,442 --> 00:31:06,376
What did you say?

314
00:31:09,681 --> 00:31:11,376
Why don't you let me know immediately
that my wife is awake.

315
00:31:11,516 --> 00:31:13,507
Once you're back,
you said not to be disturbed,

316
00:31:13,618 --> 00:31:15,313
how can I tell you?

317
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,481
Did my wife mention anything about me
when she woke up?

318
00:31:20,692 --> 00:31:22,683
Mrs. Yau won't remember a thing now.

319
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,621
Actually, I think it's a miracle
that she can wake up.

320
00:31:27,766 --> 00:31:30,667
Now, it all depends on you
to stimulate her memory.

321
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:37,506
I've arranged somebody
to look after her 24 hours.

322
00:32:10,942 --> 00:32:12,136
Darling.

323
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,378
Sit!

324
00:32:22,187 --> 00:32:23,677
Patient losing memory
normally will attack others.

325
00:32:23,788 --> 00:32:25,688
However, you don't have to be afraid,
Miss Ma will handle her.

326
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,983
Sit!

327
00:32:29,527 --> 00:32:32,519
You scared me to death,
what do you think you are doing?

328
00:32:33,531 --> 00:32:36,125
Bye. Never want to see you again!

329
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,137
What's happening?

330
00:32:46,211 --> 00:32:48,304
Help...

331
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:56,043
This woman is crazy, she beats me!

332
00:32:56,154 --> 00:32:57,348
Yes, she's always like this!

333
00:32:57,455 --> 00:32:59,150
- Luckily, you didn't break your leg!
- She is crazy!

334
00:32:59,357 --> 00:33:00,654
Let it be...

335
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:01,953
I'm scared.

336
00:33:15,307 --> 00:33:18,708
Is that true?
Is it really $100,000 per month!

337
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:22,774
He gives me $100,000 per month!

338
00:33:22,947 --> 00:33:24,847
You go and tell the Chief,
I'm taking a vacation!

339
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,745
$100,000...Bye!

340
00:33:28,753 --> 00:33:29,947
Sit!

341
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:42,224
This money is hard to earn.
She is hard to be looking after!

342
00:33:53,978 --> 00:33:59,473
This house is great!
So large and beautiful!

343
00:33:59,884 --> 00:34:03,342
Though there's not many people in it.

344
00:34:03,788 --> 00:34:04,982
Are you thirsty?

345
00:34:13,631 --> 00:34:15,826
Hold it...

346
00:34:16,968 --> 00:34:20,870
Are you thirsty?
Do you want to drink some water?

347
00:34:21,706 --> 00:34:25,198
The kitchen is over there.
Help yourself! Go!

348
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:33,543
Mr. Yau, even if I ask for $100,000 more,

349
00:34:33,618 --> 00:34:36,610
you still have to give that!

350
00:34:37,956 --> 00:34:41,756
What's wrong?

351
00:34:43,561 --> 00:34:44,858
You can't take it for granted.

352
00:34:45,263 --> 00:34:47,754
She's my wife, I can handle her!

353
00:34:51,736 --> 00:34:53,727
If you can last 10 seconds,
then you're great.

354
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,182
Come in.

355
00:35:07,685 --> 00:35:09,084
I quit!

356
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:12,052
I'll pay you $30,000 more each month?

357
00:35:13,158 --> 00:35:14,455
OK, I'll stay.

358
00:35:14,993 --> 00:35:16,483
Come on, I'll drive you home
and pick up your clothes.

359
00:35:16,661 --> 00:35:20,859
I'm not used to strange beds.

360
00:35:21,032 --> 00:35:23,023
How much more do you want
to stay overnight?

361
00:35:23,868 --> 00:35:25,768
- $3,000.
- OK! Dead!

362
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:28,268
What if I ask for $4,000.

363
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,635
I expected you to say $40,000.

364
00:35:32,877 --> 00:35:34,469
Shit!

365
00:35:35,246 --> 00:35:36,235
Go.

366
00:35:40,018 --> 00:35:41,918
From now on,
you have to report to me of what...

367
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:43,850
she eats, does and says.

368
00:35:44,189 --> 00:35:46,180
I'll give you $3,000
for every useful news.

369
00:35:46,758 --> 00:35:48,055
I'll be back any time!

370
00:35:49,027 --> 00:35:51,621
Mr. Yau, don't you live here?

371
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:54,323
Are you two OK? Why did you say that?

372
00:35:54,466 --> 00:35:57,264
We're friends, you can tell me!

373
00:36:15,987 --> 00:36:17,386
Calm down!

374
00:36:17,555 --> 00:36:21,252
It's so frightening, I had a bad dream.
Someone wants to kill me.

375
00:36:21,893 --> 00:36:23,485
What's wrong with you?

376
00:36:23,628 --> 00:36:25,118
I just had a bad dream, and I'm scared!

377
00:36:25,563 --> 00:36:27,554
Don't be frightened! Go back to sleep!

378
00:36:27,665 --> 00:36:29,064
I can't, I'm too scared!

379
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:31,064
OK, don't go to sleep.

380
00:36:31,135 --> 00:36:33,126
But I'm sleepy, stay with me please.

381
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:37,366
You're troublesome. Come on, sit here.

382
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:42,205
Sit here and sleep,
you won't have bad dream anymore.

383
00:36:42,747 --> 00:36:44,738
If you have any more bad dreams,
I'll eat them up.

384
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:48,379
I'll be with you, be quiet!

385
00:36:48,486 --> 00:36:50,477
Or else, I'll kick you!

386
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:13,572
Be honest,
this medicine was banned in the States,

387
00:37:13,912 --> 00:37:15,903
because the side effect is very strong.

388
00:37:16,047 --> 00:37:19,642
The patient many have headache,
if worst, it may be fatal.

389
00:37:20,151 --> 00:37:22,949
Who are you going to give this to?
Your wife?

390
00:37:23,454 --> 00:37:25,945
No, you said it's got side effects!

391
00:37:26,057 --> 00:37:27,854
Of course,
I won't give this to my wife. Stupid.

392
00:37:30,895 --> 00:37:32,089
Then don't!

393
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:35,829
Hey, don't forget
I bought you the doctor license.

394
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:53,983
- Mr. Yau.
- Listen.

395
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:57,113
Remember to give this potion to Mrs. Yau.

396
00:37:57,255 --> 00:37:58,654
Four times a day!

397
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:10,762
Time to take the medicine.

398
00:38:14,172 --> 00:38:15,662
Hold it yourself.

399
00:38:18,242 --> 00:38:21,040
Mr. Yau, Mrs. Yau is taking the potion.

400
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:28,582
Go to bed.

401
00:38:40,498 --> 00:38:43,990
Mr. Yau, would you like some coffee?

402
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:53,809
Mr. Yau, here's the report.

403
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,078
The first one must worth $3,000!

404
00:38:58,249 --> 00:38:59,739
Mrs. Yau screamed
in her dream last night at 10:45,

405
00:38:59,984 --> 00:39:04,250
she said...

406
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:05,783
What did she say?

407
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,421
Then this will be the second news.

408
00:39:07,525 --> 00:39:10,426
So total $6,000 Mr. Yau.

409
00:39:12,397 --> 00:39:13,887
She said she was chased by somebody.

410
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,074
Mr. Yau, I see you're not a mean guy.

411
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:36,152
I give you another goods news.

412
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:41,221
Mrs. Yau has just gone out.

413
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:19,760
Happy Birthday to you...

414
00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:21,091
Thank you.

415
00:40:21,966 --> 00:40:24,264
Make a wish before you cut the cake.

416
00:40:24,335 --> 00:40:25,825
- Really...
- It's not necessary!

417
00:40:25,937 --> 00:40:27,632
You have to!

418
00:40:27,905 --> 00:40:29,896
Then, do I need to close my eye
to make the wish?

419
00:40:30,074 --> 00:40:32,872
- Of course...
- As you wish...

420
00:40:34,912 --> 00:40:36,504
What wish should I make?

421
00:40:38,116 --> 00:40:41,415
OK...I hope my husband will love me more!

422
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:44,010
My daughter will have lots of boyfriends.

423
00:40:44,388 --> 00:40:45,582
That's all!

424
00:40:48,126 --> 00:40:49,218
Mrs. Yau.

425
00:40:57,635 --> 00:40:59,626
Oh, it's good to have you back!

426
00:40:59,737 --> 00:41:02,228
You're back, I can retire now!

427
00:41:02,907 --> 00:41:06,001
Do you know
the Chung Chi's case is a tough one!

428
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:08,008
Chung Chi? Who is he?

429
00:41:08,179 --> 00:41:11,580
Chung Chi Enterprises. Remember,
we've earned 10 million for this.

430
00:41:13,117 --> 00:41:14,311
Don't you remember?

431
00:41:14,485 --> 00:41:16,578
Please feel free to walk around,
make yourself at home.

432
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:19,121
Make yourself at home.
I'm going to a meeting. Excuse me.

433
00:41:30,201 --> 00:41:32,499
Mrs. Yau, would you like some cake?

434
00:41:35,473 --> 00:41:37,771
Am I really that dreadful?

435
00:41:39,177 --> 00:41:42,078
Please tell me. I want to know.

436
00:41:43,648 --> 00:41:44,637
What is this?

437
00:41:44,782 --> 00:41:46,682
This is your past record file.

438
00:41:48,352 --> 00:41:49,842
This girl is cute.

439
00:41:49,954 --> 00:41:52,354
She was raped by several rich guys.

440
00:41:52,557 --> 00:41:53,546
And then?

441
00:41:53,658 --> 00:41:57,856
You helped those guys
to win the case and got 5 million.

442
00:41:58,563 --> 00:41:59,860
Then what happened to her?

443
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:02,422
That girl finally jumped off the window
and killed herself.

444
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,465
Don't you remember?

445
00:42:10,508 --> 00:42:12,806
And this, a 80 years old man was
forced to move out from his apartment.

446
00:42:12,977 --> 00:42:15,673
Not only he couldn't get any money,
you even sued him,

447
00:42:15,813 --> 00:42:18,111
and put him to jail.

448
00:42:21,919 --> 00:42:24,012
Don't worry! Look at her!

449
00:42:24,121 --> 00:42:26,112
She's insane, she has lost her memory.

450
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:28,281
How would I get her back?

451
00:42:28,492 --> 00:42:31,893
Don't worry!

452
00:42:33,531 --> 00:42:35,829
Are you OK?

453
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:38,362
- Who are you?
- Me?

454
00:42:39,337 --> 00:42:42,033
I'm your only friend here.

455
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:46,506
Let's go for a drink!

456
00:42:51,649 --> 00:42:54,345
Here is very windy. Let's go to my place?

457
00:42:55,386 --> 00:42:58,082
Oh no, I want to go home.

458
00:42:59,357 --> 00:43:01,052
You really lost your memory?

459
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:03,760
I've never heard
you saying you want to go home.

460
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:08,563
Really, how come I don't like going home?

461
00:43:08,733 --> 00:43:10,325
You have also done many things.

462
00:43:11,135 --> 00:43:12,227
Like what?

463
00:43:17,441 --> 00:43:21,639
I'll do it again,
so you may remember the past, alright?

464
00:43:37,194 --> 00:43:38,889
My head is killing me!

465
00:43:39,563 --> 00:43:41,463
Don't touch me, go away!

466
00:43:41,766 --> 00:43:43,165
What are you doing?

467
00:43:56,113 --> 00:43:57,705
Nothing...

468
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,349
is there anything wrong with you?

469
00:44:15,733 --> 00:44:16,825
Sorry!

470
00:44:16,901 --> 00:44:19,392
I just want you to know.

471
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,367
No one can take away anything
that's mine.

472
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:25,134
OK, it's my fault. Sorry.

473
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:29,107
I won't do it again. Sorry!

474
00:44:33,951 --> 00:44:35,043
Attorney Chan!

475
00:44:40,024 --> 00:44:42,925
How come you're so cheap,
if you want to date other's wife?

476
00:44:43,928 --> 00:44:45,725
Don't you think you deserve it?

477
00:44:50,034 --> 00:44:51,433
Thank you!

478
00:44:59,643 --> 00:45:02,635
It's ridiculous, he said he's my friend,

479
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,314
but how come he treats me like this?

480
00:45:04,448 --> 00:45:05,847
Then why did you believe him?

481
00:45:06,317 --> 00:45:07,944
It's so good that you show up on time.

482
00:45:09,153 --> 00:45:10,848
Where is Miss Ma?

483
00:45:12,857 --> 00:45:16,953
Come and drink it. It's good for you.

484
00:45:17,061 --> 00:45:18,551
- I don't want to drink it!
- Come on!

485
00:45:27,405 --> 00:45:29,498
Sorry. This medicine is good for you.

486
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,732
It can make you remember the past.

487
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:33,867
I don't want to remember! I was so bad,
why'd I remember all these?

488
00:45:33,911 --> 00:45:37,403
- I don't want it!
- Mr. Yau.

489
00:45:37,782 --> 00:45:38,976
Mr. Yau.

490
00:45:39,483 --> 00:45:40,381
Where have you been?

491
00:45:40,684 --> 00:45:43,380
My friend's getting married.
I just go to buy her something.

492
00:45:43,521 --> 00:45:44,510
Did I pay you to shop?

493
00:45:44,688 --> 00:45:45,586
No.

494
00:45:45,723 --> 00:45:47,020
Give her the medicine.

495
00:45:48,893 --> 00:45:50,292
OK, Mr. Yau.

496
00:45:51,796 --> 00:45:54,492
You're a trouble-maker, you're worthless.

497
00:45:54,632 --> 00:45:58,534
Come, come and have your medicine...
Go to hell!

498
00:46:24,562 --> 00:46:26,553
That doctor gave you $250,000,
then you kept the evidences.

499
00:46:26,764 --> 00:46:30,256
You made me broke!
What sort of woman you are?

500
00:46:31,469 --> 00:46:32,561
Bitch!

501
00:46:33,404 --> 00:46:34,598
Bitch!

502
00:46:35,206 --> 00:46:36,503
Bloody bastard! No one likes you.

503
00:46:36,707 --> 00:46:39,107
No one wants to get close to you.

504
00:46:39,677 --> 00:46:41,975
You devil, you harmed everybody!

505
00:46:42,046 --> 00:46:43,138
Why did you wake up?

506
00:46:43,247 --> 00:46:45,738
Damn it! Why not remain coma and die?

507
00:46:51,288 --> 00:46:55,281
What's this bloody picture, all white!
Is this art?

508
00:47:05,669 --> 00:47:07,500
Bitch, open the door!

509
00:47:14,145 --> 00:47:15,942
What happened? How come you
don't open the door for me.

510
00:47:16,147 --> 00:47:18,638
My hands are occupied,
how can I open the door!

511
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:23,144
Why are you crying?
You've already got all the best!

512
00:47:23,354 --> 00:47:27,256
Get up and take your medicine.
You're so bad!

513
00:47:29,226 --> 00:47:32,127
Don't be lazy, get up! I said get up!

514
00:47:34,331 --> 00:47:37,630
What's happening?

515
00:47:37,735 --> 00:47:40,829
- I'm so worst...
- What makes you likes this?

516
00:47:40,938 --> 00:47:46,535
You've got everything you want,

517
00:47:46,744 --> 00:47:49,338
why do you want to die?

518
00:47:49,513 --> 00:47:51,413
How about those who's got cancer?

519
00:47:51,615 --> 00:47:54,516
And the sick who lost all their hair?
Why do you have to die?

520
00:47:54,618 --> 00:47:57,416
What the hell are you doing?

521
00:48:00,624 --> 00:48:02,216
What the hell are you doing?

522
00:48:03,561 --> 00:48:05,461
Death can't solve anything!

523
00:48:07,464 --> 00:48:09,557
You'll even hurt me if you dead!

524
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:11,130
Don't you know it?

525
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:15,767
Remember you've made me suffer once.

526
00:48:16,073 --> 00:48:18,268
Do you recall it?

527
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:23,312
It's better to forget everything
and start all over again.

528
00:48:23,514 --> 00:48:26,005
You don't have to do it? Understand?

529
00:48:26,116 --> 00:48:27,105
You see, your skin is so nice.

530
00:48:27,218 --> 00:48:30,619
It's no good to have a scar here!

531
00:48:31,422 --> 00:48:34,516
I know you were very bad!

532
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:36,384
But so what, you're smart.

533
00:48:37,394 --> 00:48:40,090
You can start again.
You can help the need.

534
00:48:40,231 --> 00:48:43,029
It's good to be able to help! Right?

535
00:48:43,067 --> 00:48:46,264
Like a goddess, alright?

536
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:47,869
Now, alright, don't cry any more.

537
00:48:47,972 --> 00:48:49,769
I'll fix you something to eat, OK?

538
00:48:50,307 --> 00:48:52,104
Now remember, be a good girl,

539
00:48:52,243 --> 00:48:53,733
and don't tell your husband about this.

540
00:48:53,911 --> 00:48:55,708
Or else if he fires me, I'll be dead!

541
00:48:55,879 --> 00:48:57,676
Then I won't be able to
take care of you again, right?

542
00:48:58,215 --> 00:49:00,012
Stop crying...

543
00:49:00,784 --> 00:49:01,773
Oh shit! It's awful,

544
00:49:01,952 --> 00:49:03,419
I don't remember how to wrap it!

545
00:49:05,322 --> 00:49:06,311
Coffee.

546
00:49:07,858 --> 00:49:11,259
Brother Lung, I'm so scared,
you've got to help me.

547
00:49:11,595 --> 00:49:12,584
What's up?

548
00:49:12,796 --> 00:49:14,593
That guy from Thailand
called me this morning.

549
00:49:14,665 --> 00:49:17,065
I was shaking all over
when I picked up that phone.

550
00:49:17,701 --> 00:49:20,295
My hands are still shaking now, you see.

551
00:49:20,404 --> 00:49:22,201
Why didn't he call me instead?

552
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:24,830
Yeah, that's why I feel so strange.

553
00:49:24,942 --> 00:49:27,240
I told him on the phone
that you are my big brother.

554
00:49:27,344 --> 00:49:29,539
- I only listen to you.
- What are you talking about?

555
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:31,613
I'm talking about money.
That 10 million dollars.

556
00:49:31,849 --> 00:49:33,749
He asked
why hasn't he received them by now.

557
00:49:36,987 --> 00:49:38,284
That's funny.

558
00:49:40,124 --> 00:49:43,423
OK, ask yourself. You've co-operated
with that Thailand guy for so long,

559
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:47,155
and you've washed so much black money
for him. It's OK so far.

560
00:49:47,331 --> 00:49:50,323
Now it's only 10 million dollars.
I really can't stand it.

561
00:49:50,934 --> 00:49:54,335
Brother Lung,
are you really doing OK now?

562
00:49:54,438 --> 00:49:56,235
Tell me, see if I can help.

563
00:49:56,373 --> 00:49:57,965
I'll handle it myself.

564
00:49:58,609 --> 00:49:59,701
You don't have to do it this way.

565
00:49:59,877 --> 00:50:02,573
It's money. I've got to be more careful.

566
00:50:03,714 --> 00:50:04,510
What are you talking about?

567
00:50:04,682 --> 00:50:08,083
You told me so.
I memorize that since then.

568
00:50:10,254 --> 00:50:12,848
Now.
Talking about that 10 million dollars.

569
00:50:13,157 --> 00:50:14,749
What happens to my share?

570
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:19,027
You know I've got 10 apartments
in Hung Shan Peninsula.

571
00:50:19,697 --> 00:50:21,995
I can't take it anymore now.

572
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,670
Is this beautiful?

573
00:50:37,781 --> 00:50:38,679
It looks good.

574
00:50:38,782 --> 00:50:40,477
This shirt is very expensive. Thank you.

575
00:50:41,085 --> 00:50:43,576
Do you think Mr. Yau would mind
if I don't wear uniform?

576
00:50:44,021 --> 00:50:45,010
You don't have to bother about.

577
00:50:45,155 --> 00:50:47,646
I like you dressing like this.
I don't like you wearing uniform.

578
00:50:48,192 --> 00:50:49,489
I'll buy you
the matching trousers next time.

579
00:50:49,626 --> 00:50:51,218
Good. Thank you.

580
00:50:52,262 --> 00:50:54,162
Why are you always looking so angry
when you take a photo?

581
00:50:56,433 --> 00:50:58,230
Where are your photos with your husband?

582
00:50:58,402 --> 00:50:59,994
Is this the only one?

583
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:03,606
Where are your wedding pictures?

584
00:51:04,775 --> 00:51:06,174
I don't think we have taken that.

585
00:51:06,643 --> 00:51:09,077
Are you serious?
You don't even have wedding photo.

586
00:51:10,214 --> 00:51:13,206
Oh, no, I really don't think
I've taken any!

587
00:51:15,152 --> 00:51:19,145
It's OK as long as I've got a husband.
Is that true?

588
00:51:26,497 --> 00:51:28,089
How can it be so ugly?

589
00:51:28,265 --> 00:51:30,062
Did your husband give you this?

590
00:51:31,101 --> 00:51:32,398
I just picked it up.

591
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,863
When I was young,

592
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:41,443
my family was very poor,
there's no money to buy any dolls.

593
00:51:42,346 --> 00:51:45,247
My father left us long time ago.

594
00:51:47,918 --> 00:51:49,715
This doll was picked up...

595
00:51:50,721 --> 00:51:53,622
by my mother in the market.

596
00:51:55,058 --> 00:51:58,459
It's head has already fallen apart!

597
00:51:58,896 --> 00:52:01,194
Then my mother said
she would mend it for me.

598
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,067
However, she was dead
before she could fix it.

599
00:52:08,338 --> 00:52:14,140
I remembered when she's dying.
I've made a vow that...

600
00:52:15,145 --> 00:52:16,942
I must be rich...

601
00:52:17,648 --> 00:52:20,742
and I was going to buy a thousand dolls
to put beside her tomb.

602
00:52:23,787 --> 00:52:26,381
I succeeded in doing this when I was 20.

603
00:52:28,826 --> 00:52:33,320
The money come from...A man gave me that.

604
00:52:35,499 --> 00:52:39,196
I went to bed with a fat and ugly guy.

605
00:52:43,307 --> 00:52:46,105
It's him who gave me money
to go to university!

606
00:53:06,797 --> 00:53:07,821
What do you think of this color?

607
00:53:07,898 --> 00:53:09,490
Any color is better than the old one.

608
00:53:09,633 --> 00:53:12,625
That's true, I just don't understand
why your husband like this stuff.

609
00:53:13,003 --> 00:53:14,595
Don't mention my husband all the time.

610
00:53:14,671 --> 00:53:16,866
Do you have a husband?

611
00:53:17,374 --> 00:53:18,671
I wanted to!

612
00:53:20,244 --> 00:53:22,940
But I've never had any date before!

613
00:53:24,414 --> 00:53:26,006
I don't think I'll get any chance.

614
00:53:26,183 --> 00:53:28,583
I'm old and ugly.

615
00:53:29,486 --> 00:53:31,784
- I won't take the medicine.
- Even if you want to, nothing is left.

616
00:53:32,689 --> 00:53:35,180
Remember? When you tried to
kill yourself last time.

617
00:53:35,459 --> 00:53:37,154
You kicked it over!

618
00:53:37,227 --> 00:53:40,128
I've gone to the hospital to
get some more. But, don't tell Mr. Yau.

619
00:53:45,235 --> 00:53:47,430
Is Mr. and Mrs. Yau here, please?

620
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:52,731
That guy was quite good looking.
Why did he have to be a thief?

621
00:53:55,612 --> 00:53:56,909
She doesn't know anything.

622
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,880
He's got a gun.

623
00:53:59,049 --> 00:54:00,641
Why didn't he rob a bank or a goldsmith?

624
00:54:00,784 --> 00:54:02,274
But robbed her?

625
00:54:05,522 --> 00:54:07,752
She doesn't know anything.

626
00:54:09,092 --> 00:54:13,859
Mrs. Yau, I just come to
ask for more information.

627
00:54:14,264 --> 00:54:18,724
She hasn't recovered yet,
I don't think she can help you any way.

628
00:54:20,604 --> 00:54:24,096
OK, then, I'll go now, Mrs. Yau.

629
00:54:28,211 --> 00:54:31,703
I am cooking some fish, shrimps and soup.

630
00:54:31,848 --> 00:54:33,907
Why don't you stay over for the meal
and we can talk.

631
00:54:33,951 --> 00:54:36,647
May be we'll come up something.
Come on, sit here!

632
00:54:36,687 --> 00:54:39,679
Oh, no,
my wife is waiting for me at home.

633
00:54:42,893 --> 00:54:44,087
Mrs. Yau,

634
00:54:44,895 --> 00:54:47,193
we are suspecting
that dead man coming in...

635
00:54:47,364 --> 00:54:48,854
did not just come to rob, but...

636
00:54:50,934 --> 00:54:53,835
So what? If you got anything to say.
Talk to my lawyer.

637
00:54:54,137 --> 00:54:55,832
Could you stop disturbing my wife?

638
00:54:56,273 --> 00:54:58,764
Mr. Yau, it's only our procedure!

639
00:55:00,377 --> 00:55:03,744
Mr. and Mrs. Yau. I'll go now.

640
00:55:05,882 --> 00:55:06,974
Shrimp.

641
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:10,847
Yes, I'll tell my wife
to cook some shrimps tonight.

642
00:55:33,276 --> 00:55:38,077
I'm felling better now.
It's all Miss Ma's help.

643
00:55:38,815 --> 00:55:41,613
She taught me how to make this soup.

644
00:55:42,386 --> 00:55:43,580
Is she good to you?

645
00:55:44,021 --> 00:55:45,921
- Did you say she's fierce?
- No, I haven't.

646
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:50,787
Today, I remembered
many things about my childhood.

647
00:55:51,595 --> 00:55:54,530
I think I'm going to gain back my money.

648
00:56:15,018 --> 00:56:16,110
Do you want to have some more?

649
00:56:16,186 --> 00:56:17,676
You go on, I will take it myself.

650
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:21,382
Mr. Yau, you want some more soup?

651
00:56:21,525 --> 00:56:24,119
This's delicious. My wife told me
it's you taught her to make the soup.

652
00:56:24,327 --> 00:56:25,123
Yes, that's right.

653
00:56:25,228 --> 00:56:26,525
- I can do it myself.
- OK.

654
00:56:27,397 --> 00:56:29,797
She's feeling better now. Thank you.

655
00:56:30,033 --> 00:56:34,129
Don't mention it. Mr. Yau,
I've got your money, so I will do it.

656
00:56:35,372 --> 00:56:37,067
Do you feel that
she's not so scared about me recently?

657
00:56:37,207 --> 00:56:39,505
Yes, that's good.

658
00:56:41,878 --> 00:56:43,573
Starting tonight,
I'll keep her companion myself.

659
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,974
Good.

660
00:56:52,522 --> 00:56:57,016
You want to fire me? Mr. Yau,
do you really want to fire me?

661
00:57:00,797 --> 00:57:01,593
Not enough?

662
00:57:01,665 --> 00:57:05,226
No, it's more than enough.
Thank you, Mr. Yau.

663
00:57:06,636 --> 00:57:08,934
I can retire now.

664
00:57:09,706 --> 00:57:11,105
When should I leave?

665
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:14,139
I'll leave tonight!

666
00:57:20,317 --> 00:57:22,615
I just don't understand
who do you leave now?

667
00:57:22,786 --> 00:57:25,186
If you really want to go,
why not wait till tomorrow.

668
00:57:25,388 --> 00:57:26,787
Where can you go now? It's so late.

669
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:28,187
I will be going back to my doom.

670
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:33,452
Mr. Yau, he said he would come back
to take care of you himself.

671
00:57:33,597 --> 00:57:35,292
That's good, right?

672
00:57:35,465 --> 00:57:37,160
Don't look back!

673
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,200
Turn a new page, OK?

674
00:57:39,402 --> 00:57:42,098
You two will go fonder after
you're separated for a little while.

675
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:45,333
You can walk around naked at your home.
Right?

676
00:57:45,475 --> 00:57:48,069
It's not convenient if I am here.
Is that true?

677
00:57:48,345 --> 00:57:49,744
Can I see you again?

678
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:53,577
Of course,
you can treat me lunch or dinner.

679
00:57:53,717 --> 00:57:56,618
And I can come
and visit you again some time, OK?

680
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,915
Don't be upset, go inside.

681
00:57:59,022 --> 00:58:00,922
- I will walk you out!
- There's no need.

682
00:58:01,024 --> 00:58:04,482
Go inside and have a good time!
Go inside, bye.

683
00:59:04,988 --> 00:59:08,788
After Miss Ma left, there will be
only you and me in this house.

684
00:59:08,925 --> 00:59:10,916
I really want to help you
to remember all the past.

685
00:59:11,761 --> 00:59:13,558
You've got to help me.

686
00:59:13,964 --> 00:59:15,556
How are we getting along in the past?

687
00:59:16,233 --> 00:59:19,361
We seldom stay home together.

688
00:59:20,704 --> 00:59:23,195
I must be always working
in my lawyer firm.

689
00:59:23,406 --> 00:59:25,499
I'm definitely not a good wife.

690
00:59:26,409 --> 00:59:27,808
Why did you marry me?

691
00:59:27,944 --> 00:59:29,343
Because I'm worse than you!

692
00:59:30,614 --> 00:59:32,514
I pretend to be a broker,

693
00:59:33,383 --> 00:59:34,975
but I'm really helping someone
to wash black money.

694
00:59:35,752 --> 00:59:36,946
Other than Hong Kong,

695
00:59:37,187 --> 00:59:41,180
I've also got many clients
in USA and South-East Asia.

696
00:59:42,893 --> 00:59:46,294
Do you know that
the money earned by my company,

697
00:59:47,063 --> 00:59:48,553
you can have a share.

698
00:59:50,433 --> 00:59:51,627
I also have a share?

699
00:59:51,735 --> 00:59:56,695
Thailand guy asked me
to wash 10 million black money.

700
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,932
And you've hidden the money
before you lost your money.

701
01:00:01,111 --> 01:00:03,306
Why did I have to
hide your 10 million dollars.

702
01:00:04,581 --> 01:00:06,071
Because you wanted to set me up.

703
01:00:10,854 --> 01:00:14,688
Do you know that the Thailand guy
is forcing me to return the money.

704
01:00:16,092 --> 01:00:18,583
If you can't remember
where you have put it,

705
01:00:19,429 --> 01:00:21,420
then we will be in big trouble.

706
01:00:30,507 --> 01:00:32,202
I can't, I can't remember.

707
01:00:32,342 --> 01:00:34,936
Don't think of it now,
you can't remember that this way.

708
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:38,970
I'll take you to play a game.
It is exciting!

709
01:00:39,582 --> 01:00:40,776
What would we be playing?

710
01:00:41,184 --> 01:00:43,982
It's what we used to play.
You must love it.

711
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:48,689
Sorry, we're closed!

712
01:00:48,925 --> 01:00:51,416
- They've closed already!
- Please come again tomorrow.

713
01:00:52,462 --> 01:00:53,656
Pack up your stuffs.

714
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:54,719
Cover up your face.

715
01:00:54,864 --> 01:00:56,855
- What?
- Cover up your face.

716
01:01:00,704 --> 01:01:02,797
Don't move. Freeze!

717
01:01:02,973 --> 01:01:05,134
Give me all the hamburgers!

718
01:01:05,308 --> 01:01:06,707
I told you to cover up!

719
01:01:09,212 --> 01:01:11,806
I don't want money.
I want hamburger! Hamburger!

720
01:01:11,982 --> 01:01:13,677
OK! Give them all the hamburgers.

721
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:15,442
No need for chips, I don't like chips!

722
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:25,652
Hurry, pack this up!

723
01:01:25,795 --> 01:01:27,285
I caught him...

724
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:29,921
Put it down. Come on! Be careful!
He wants to call the police!

725
01:01:30,133 --> 01:01:31,532
Let's flee with the hamburgers.

726
01:01:31,801 --> 01:01:33,701
- Quick!
- Come on, hurry up!

727
01:01:33,803 --> 01:01:36,397
Come on, hurry up!

728
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,439
It's very excited. Let's try again!

729
01:01:38,608 --> 01:01:39,802
OK! Let's play murder next time!

730
01:01:39,843 --> 01:01:46,339
It's not this? Go this way.

731
01:01:50,587 --> 01:01:55,183
It's dangerous! Very excited!

732
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:57,349
Go...

733
01:02:01,064 --> 01:02:02,258
See how scared you're!

734
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:06,893
Of course!
We've just committed a robbery.

735
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,400
Do you find it excited?

736
01:02:09,672 --> 01:02:13,369
It really does! But it's not right!

737
01:02:13,877 --> 01:02:16,778
That's what you told me
when you first defended me.

738
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,508
What's the result?

739
01:02:19,616 --> 01:02:21,106
So you became my legal consultant
and my wife.

740
01:02:22,585 --> 01:02:26,487
Oh yeah! It's real excited
to deal with the ICAC.

741
01:02:28,825 --> 01:02:30,315
You recall something?

742
01:02:31,628 --> 01:02:32,925
A little bit.

743
01:02:34,531 --> 01:02:37,625
I don't know why I always recall...

744
01:02:37,867 --> 01:02:39,664
something unhappy.

745
01:02:41,037 --> 01:02:42,334
Then forget it.

746
01:02:42,806 --> 01:02:46,105
See what we've stolen.

747
01:02:47,577 --> 01:02:49,272
- What do you want to eat?
- I want chicken.

748
01:02:49,446 --> 01:02:51,437
Chicken? There's only one here.

749
01:02:52,048 --> 01:02:53,640
I want it...

750
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:55,650
- What do you want?
- Oh...

751
01:02:59,255 --> 01:03:01,450
Come on...Here...

752
01:03:01,558 --> 01:03:03,753
No! I've got it, it's mine!

753
01:03:03,927 --> 01:03:05,792
You've cheated much money from me.

754
01:03:05,995 --> 01:03:08,486
I've taken the 10 million US dollars,
they're mine.

755
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,090
Give me back the money!

756
01:03:25,548 --> 01:03:27,539
Mister,
there're eight sorts of ice-cream.

757
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,945
Can I have half cone of each?

758
01:03:30,086 --> 01:03:31,280
What about you take one for each?

759
01:03:31,488 --> 01:03:35,481
Oh no! It's too rich!
Let me think about it!

760
01:03:35,692 --> 01:03:37,091
Sure, no problem.

761
01:03:42,332 --> 01:03:43,321
Delicious!

762
01:03:43,533 --> 01:03:45,831
You look strange!

763
01:03:50,907 --> 01:03:52,204
Someone is dating me!

764
01:03:56,412 --> 01:03:58,403
That's wonderful but don't tease me!

765
01:04:00,717 --> 01:04:05,086
He is six years smaller...

766
01:04:06,289 --> 01:04:07,984
and he treats me very good,

767
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:14,456
although he is ugly, he is very gentle.

768
01:04:16,132 --> 01:04:17,929
I'll introduce him to you next time!

769
01:04:19,802 --> 01:04:22,100
Let's talk about other,
what do you want me for?

770
01:04:24,841 --> 01:04:26,934
- Let's take a look.
- What's that?

771
01:04:31,548 --> 01:04:33,038
It's the authorization paper,

772
01:04:33,183 --> 01:04:35,083
I can sue the bloody doctor now.

773
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:40,020
I have remembered you told him
to burn it away.

774
01:04:40,223 --> 01:04:42,123
- That was a phony one.
- Really?

775
01:04:42,258 --> 01:04:44,249
This is the original.

776
01:04:44,727 --> 01:04:46,024
So you remember everything?

777
01:04:46,963 --> 01:04:50,660
Oh no, I just happened to remember this,

778
01:04:51,434 --> 01:04:53,425
then I forgot the others.

779
01:04:53,536 --> 01:04:55,834
Never mind, it makes no harm,

780
01:04:56,005 --> 01:04:58,030
it doesn't matter.

781
01:04:58,074 --> 01:04:59,871
What do you think about
your husband now?

782
01:05:00,043 --> 01:05:02,944
I don't know! I really don't know.

783
01:05:04,414 --> 01:05:05,711
He's a bit strange, but he's nice to you.

784
01:05:05,848 --> 01:05:10,182
He loves you and cherishes you.

785
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,420
So you shouldn't eat too much ice-cream,

786
01:05:12,488 --> 01:05:14,479
or else your boyfriend may dump you.

787
01:05:16,392 --> 01:05:17,586
He doesn't mind if I put on weight!

788
01:05:26,502 --> 01:05:27,594
Like it?

789
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:29,863
Yeah. You painted it?

790
01:05:30,139 --> 01:05:32,437
Of course not, I asked people to do it.

791
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:35,202
You said you didn't like the old one.

792
01:05:36,913 --> 01:05:39,814
I just went to have ice-cream
with Madam Ma,

793
01:05:39,882 --> 01:05:41,474
and I've a bucked for you!

794
01:05:41,751 --> 01:05:42,843
That's good!

795
01:05:43,586 --> 01:05:44,883
I'll take the call first!

796
01:05:50,994 --> 01:05:52,291
Hello, Chu, how is it?

797
01:05:55,431 --> 01:05:56,523
What?

798
01:05:58,801 --> 01:06:00,098
Are you crazy?

799
01:06:01,604 --> 01:06:03,003
What did you say?

800
01:06:05,341 --> 01:06:06,239
OK!

801
01:06:48,184 --> 01:06:51,278
Brother Lung, I've got trouble.

802
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:12,736
I have subscribed the whole thing.

803
01:07:12,909 --> 01:07:15,207
Please help me, I can't take it any more.

804
01:07:15,378 --> 01:07:16,276
You thought I was better off?

805
01:07:16,479 --> 01:07:18,674
No kidding, man?

806
01:07:18,748 --> 01:07:21,182
I've got any share
of the 10 million US dollars,

807
01:07:21,351 --> 01:07:22,545
it's not possible!

808
01:07:28,224 --> 01:07:29,316
I'll take care of you!

809
01:07:29,425 --> 01:07:31,916
What's the use? No money no talk!

810
01:07:32,095 --> 01:07:35,087
Even your wife will betray you!

811
01:07:42,572 --> 01:07:44,369
What have I done?

812
01:07:48,077 --> 01:07:49,476
Who seduced your wife?

813
01:07:49,612 --> 01:07:52,706
You know I'm nice to her
and I really love her.

814
01:07:55,051 --> 01:07:58,543
Stay cool, man!

815
01:07:58,755 --> 01:08:01,155
We've got through lots of crises.

816
01:08:01,324 --> 01:08:03,315
How come you change like that
for a woman,

817
01:08:03,459 --> 01:08:06,223
- Is it worth?
- I really loved her very much!

818
01:08:06,996 --> 01:08:08,588
Man shouldn't cry!

819
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:11,963
It's only a woman.

820
01:08:12,935 --> 01:08:16,632
OK! I'll check this man out.

821
01:08:17,106 --> 01:08:21,543
Then we'll give him a lesson!
So, settle now!

822
01:08:38,561 --> 01:08:44,466
You played my wife.
You don't give my share.

823
01:08:44,567 --> 01:08:48,663
You owe me money, I want to kill you!

824
01:08:54,677 --> 01:09:00,081
Damn you! You sleep with my wife!

825
01:09:00,216 --> 01:09:03,708
You said I'm your dog.

826
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:08,286
Band on the floor.
I made you a dog, I've to smash you.

827
01:09:08,524 --> 01:09:10,515
Bitch...

828
01:09:10,993 --> 01:09:13,587
I want to kill you now.

829
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:16,825
Don't move! Bitch, you dare to hit me?

830
01:09:16,933 --> 01:09:19,561
You both are the same shit!

831
01:09:38,054 --> 01:09:43,458
Cool down...Listened?
I asked you to calm down!

832
01:09:44,727 --> 01:09:47,719
Call the ambulance!

833
01:09:47,864 --> 01:09:49,354
He's dead!

834
01:09:49,565 --> 01:09:50,964
Not yet!

835
01:09:51,133 --> 01:09:56,833
He's dead!

836
01:09:57,874 --> 01:09:59,774
We've killed him?

837
01:10:00,376 --> 01:10:01,866
It's him who tried to kill you first.

838
01:10:04,514 --> 01:10:09,213
If we're discovered, I'll take the blame!

839
01:10:10,386 --> 01:10:12,081
No...

840
01:10:56,866 --> 01:11:00,666
Oh, that police! Don't look back!
You've got blood stain!

841
01:11:01,437 --> 01:11:03,632
You're stained too! Get calm!

842
01:11:03,773 --> 01:11:06,333
- What should I do?
- It's OK!

843
01:11:06,509 --> 01:11:09,501
No, he'll go after us, what shall we do?

844
01:11:09,845 --> 01:11:11,039
Mrs. Yau, Mr. Yau...

845
01:11:19,689 --> 01:11:21,384
Calm down.

846
01:11:25,595 --> 01:11:26,789
Let me hit you!

847
01:11:26,963 --> 01:11:28,658
What are you doing?

848
01:11:30,933 --> 01:11:35,632
No! Oh I can't remember! Oh!

849
01:11:36,906 --> 01:11:40,899
Let it be! OK! It's OK!

850
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:42,407
Mr. Yau, are you alright?

851
01:11:42,912 --> 01:11:44,709
It's OK? She will behave like this
every now and then.

852
01:11:45,581 --> 01:11:46,570
Is there anything you want from us?

853
01:11:47,783 --> 01:11:49,478
About the dead man Fan Shu Hung.

854
01:11:49,619 --> 01:11:51,610
On that night,

855
01:11:51,754 --> 01:11:53,551
he left after he's received the call.

856
01:11:54,123 --> 01:11:56,216
We are going to find out who called him.

857
01:11:56,659 --> 01:11:58,251
You better take a rest!

858
01:11:59,829 --> 01:12:01,023
You're bleeding.

859
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:07,469
It's OK...He's left, it's alright!

860
01:12:11,107 --> 01:12:12,404
Don't panic.

861
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:39,760
You don't need to remember the past,

862
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:44,231
and where you hide
the 10 million dollars.

863
01:13:46,402 --> 01:13:49,496
I've decided to
sell this house and leave.

864
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:52,668
Do you take me with you?

865
01:13:52,808 --> 01:13:55,709
Of course! You're my wife.

866
01:13:57,446 --> 01:13:59,744
Did you treat me like this before?

867
01:14:04,353 --> 01:14:07,618
It doesn't matter now.
Anyway you have forgotten the past.

868
01:14:09,258 --> 01:14:10,657
What about the future?

869
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:13,753
Will you love me?

870
01:14:39,188 --> 01:14:41,486
- Three.
- Four.

871
01:14:41,657 --> 01:14:43,557
- Five.
- Six.

872
01:14:44,059 --> 01:14:49,361
- Seven.
- Eight.

873
01:14:50,499 --> 01:14:52,990
- Nine.
- Ten.

874
01:14:53,469 --> 01:14:54,766
Eleven.

875
01:14:58,574 --> 01:15:02,670
You lost! There's no eleven.

876
01:15:21,897 --> 01:15:24,297
You look so red.

877
01:15:24,466 --> 01:15:27,663
Oh no! You're sitting on my saline pack.

878
01:15:27,803 --> 01:15:29,998
I can't take it any more!

879
01:15:33,242 --> 01:15:34,436
Oh, sorry!

880
01:15:36,245 --> 01:15:37,644
You naughty guy!

881
01:15:37,813 --> 01:15:39,610
We are waiting for you for operation.

882
01:15:39,748 --> 01:15:42,046
How come you hide inside Madam Ma's room?

883
01:15:44,053 --> 01:15:45,645
The medicine that you gave me
was banned in the States for years.

884
01:15:45,788 --> 01:15:49,690
The side effect is very severe.

885
01:15:49,792 --> 01:15:51,987
It'll kill you if you over-dosed.

886
01:15:52,027 --> 01:15:54,120
Where did you get it?

887
01:15:59,068 --> 01:16:00,467
Hello! Sister?

888
01:16:00,603 --> 01:16:02,002
Miss Ma, what's the matter?

889
01:16:02,137 --> 01:16:03,434
Your medicine...

890
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:06,105
Is your husband there?

891
01:16:06,809 --> 01:16:08,504
Yes, please hold on.

892
01:16:08,978 --> 01:16:10,570
It's for you! It seems very urgent.

893
01:16:13,349 --> 01:16:17,217
Mr. Yau, the medicine
you gave it to your wife,

894
01:16:17,419 --> 01:16:20,047
was banned in the States for years.

895
01:16:20,756 --> 01:16:23,748
Overdosed will cause lots of
side effects, and is very harmful!

896
01:16:26,562 --> 01:16:27,961
You wait for me in the hospital,
I'll come over.

897
01:16:29,665 --> 01:16:30,654
What's the matter?

898
01:16:32,201 --> 01:16:33,600
She said there's something wrong.

899
01:16:33,869 --> 01:16:35,063
What's the problem?

900
01:16:36,505 --> 01:16:38,700
She said, there were some problems
with your medicine.

901
01:16:38,841 --> 01:16:39,739
Really?

902
01:16:39,842 --> 01:16:43,039
I must see her. It should be alright!

903
01:17:03,766 --> 01:17:04,528
Mr. Yau.

904
01:17:04,566 --> 01:17:06,534
- Have you called the police?
- No! But I'm going to.

905
01:17:07,369 --> 01:17:08,768
Oh...Get in, get into my car.

906
01:17:39,401 --> 01:17:43,497
Give half million as my anniversary gift?

907
01:17:52,214 --> 01:17:53,704
Anyway, we are a couple.

908
01:17:54,917 --> 01:17:56,908
Do you remember
the last time you went to bed with me?

909
01:17:57,052 --> 01:17:57,950
Do you expect me to sleep with you?

910
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:01,021
Back to business! You turned pale
when mentioning the Thai.

911
01:18:01,357 --> 01:18:03,052
- Just like a dog!
- Have you finished yet?

912
01:18:03,225 --> 01:18:06,683
Hit me, come on beat me, come on!

913
01:19:18,767 --> 01:19:21,793
Mr. Yau...

914
01:19:22,471 --> 01:19:24,462
Do you know that bloody doctor?

915
01:19:25,908 --> 01:19:27,205
Not quite.

916
01:19:28,911 --> 01:19:30,606
When he gave you the medicine,

917
01:19:31,046 --> 01:19:35,142
did he mention that it was harmful?

918
01:19:35,717 --> 01:19:37,014
No!

919
01:19:40,255 --> 01:19:42,849
Are you sure?
How come it would like this?

920
01:19:42,991 --> 01:19:46,290
It's a matter of life. You can make joke,
but you can't abuse medicine!

921
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:49,627
You're too careless.

922
01:19:52,501 --> 01:19:56,267
Is that doctor one of her enemy?

923
01:19:56,405 --> 01:19:59,397
Not to mention that doctor.

924
01:19:59,508 --> 01:20:01,999
Even I also wanted to kill her, right?

925
01:20:07,349 --> 01:20:10,841
Oh no! We must do something.

926
01:20:11,753 --> 01:20:13,653
We must call the police!

927
01:20:13,989 --> 01:20:16,082
- Let's make the call!
- Does it help to call the police?

928
01:20:17,259 --> 01:20:20,660
It may not be, in fact I've tried before.

929
01:20:20,829 --> 01:20:24,822
Let it be...
Anyway I'll never give this to her,

930
01:20:25,167 --> 01:20:28,068
and I'll never see the doctor again.
Let it be!

931
01:20:29,505 --> 01:20:31,097
Let's find some place to eat?

932
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:33,773
Where?

933
01:20:34,009 --> 01:20:38,503
You got the money. You can nail him!
Come on, call the police...

934
01:20:38,747 --> 01:20:41,045
How to operate the phone?

935
01:20:41,183 --> 01:20:42,980
- Don't do it.
- Why?

936
01:20:43,819 --> 01:20:45,218
Let's go to the police directly.

937
01:20:45,487 --> 01:20:50,584
Yes, that's right!
It's better we go in person!

938
01:20:59,902 --> 01:21:03,804
The road is temporary closed,
please use the other route.

939
01:21:04,573 --> 01:21:06,234
Let's turn the other way!

940
01:22:54,449 --> 01:22:56,440
Don't kill me!

941
01:22:58,954 --> 01:23:03,857
I'm going to married!
Don't kill me, I've no money.

942
01:23:04,026 --> 01:23:10,192
Why do you have to kill me.

943
01:23:10,332 --> 01:23:14,029
Don't...please don't...

944
01:24:10,792 --> 01:24:12,487
You finally recall
where you put the money?

945
01:24:15,731 --> 01:24:17,824
I remember everything.

946
01:24:22,871 --> 01:24:25,567
I've tried to figure out
what should I do.

947
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:28,570
I've three alternatives.

948
01:24:29,911 --> 01:24:31,708
I can call the police,

949
01:24:33,081 --> 01:24:35,174
or shoot you dead,

950
01:24:36,885 --> 01:24:39,581
or we can give the Thai back
all the money.

951
01:24:39,855 --> 01:24:43,655
Then we sell this house and leave here.

952
01:24:45,026 --> 01:24:46,618
So what have you decided?

953
01:24:51,366 --> 01:24:53,163
I shouldn't be forgiven!

954
01:24:53,301 --> 01:24:55,098
I deserved it.

955
01:24:57,038 --> 01:24:59,336
I've decided to forget all the past.

956
01:25:02,411 --> 01:25:06,370
Let's give them their money and leave!

957
01:25:09,551 --> 01:25:12,850
No problem...

958
01:25:22,864 --> 01:25:24,263
Mr. Yau, Mrs. Yau.

959
01:25:24,466 --> 01:25:28,368
I saw your back door was unlocked.
I'm afraid someone may break in,

960
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:30,963
so I come from the back.

961
01:25:31,506 --> 01:25:33,906
Did I scare you?

962
01:25:34,543 --> 01:25:38,138
Mrs. Yau, you look much better now!

963
01:25:43,118 --> 01:25:45,712
It's good to change the color!

964
01:25:46,721 --> 01:25:48,814
Mr. Yau, please excuse me.

965
01:25:49,524 --> 01:25:53,221
I think there is something wrong
with your house's Fungshui.

966
01:25:53,795 --> 01:25:56,286
Last time,
I just stayed here for a while,

967
01:25:56,398 --> 01:25:58,798
then I'd quarrel with my wife.

968
01:25:59,367 --> 01:26:01,358
Then I had to sleep in the dinning room
for two nights.

969
01:26:02,938 --> 01:26:04,337
Anything to drink?

970
01:26:04,473 --> 01:26:07,840
Oh, thanks.

971
01:26:08,643 --> 01:26:10,634
Mr. Yau.
Have you seen Chu Chung Hong lately?

972
01:26:11,213 --> 01:26:12,407
No, what's the matter?

973
01:26:13,415 --> 01:26:17,112
Well, Chu Chung Hong was missing.

974
01:26:17,586 --> 01:26:19,076
Before that,

975
01:26:19,421 --> 01:26:21,855
he had beaten up his wife.

976
01:26:22,991 --> 01:26:25,789
Surprising his wife called your name...

977
01:26:25,927 --> 01:26:28,225
instead of her husband,

978
01:26:28,396 --> 01:26:30,193
when she regained consciousness.

979
01:26:32,534 --> 01:26:34,229
How come it's like this?

980
01:26:36,938 --> 01:26:39,930
I think may be Mrs. Chu
is one of our best friends,

981
01:26:40,141 --> 01:26:42,541
especially for me,
we're just like sisters,

982
01:26:42,978 --> 01:26:44,172
she was beaten up by Mr. Chu,

983
01:26:44,346 --> 01:26:46,940
she must want us to help.

984
01:26:47,115 --> 01:26:49,015
I understand...

985
01:26:49,718 --> 01:26:51,913
You two are really very affectionate,

986
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:55,116
please teach me
how to maintain this relationship.

987
01:26:56,024 --> 01:26:58,219
I...I just get married.

988
01:27:00,729 --> 01:27:04,722
Mrs. Yau, in fact I wanted to discuss
Madam Ma's case with you.

989
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:07,460
- I hope you'll get prepared.
- What is it?

990
01:27:08,136 --> 01:27:11,902
Ma was killed at the entrance
of the Junk Bay Tunnel an hour ago,

991
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:14,240
and she's got several wounds.

992
01:27:27,122 --> 01:27:29,113
Why did you do it?

993
01:27:30,292 --> 01:27:33,693
Do you understand, she's my only friend!

994
01:27:34,362 --> 01:27:36,853
I don't mind what you've done before.

995
01:27:37,532 --> 01:27:39,932
I don't care even you had killed me,

996
01:27:40,735 --> 01:27:43,226
but you can't kill her.

997
01:27:46,107 --> 01:27:48,200
Mr. Yau, excuse me.

998
01:28:02,424 --> 01:28:04,016
Open the door...

999
01:28:50,071 --> 01:28:52,369
Cool down!

1000
01:28:53,074 --> 01:28:54,564
Don't get too impulsive!

1001
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:58,709
We've solved
a lot of difficulties before.

1002
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,780
How can you give up now?

1003
01:29:03,885 --> 01:29:07,844
Get lost! If you don't go away.
I'll kill you.

1004
01:29:08,356 --> 01:29:11,757
Don't you understand?
I was forced to kill her.

1005
01:29:14,029 --> 01:29:16,930
She threatened me
to disclose all my secrets!

1006
01:29:22,170 --> 01:29:25,970
I don't care if I've to go to jail,
but I don't want to get you involved!

1007
01:29:28,743 --> 01:29:35,046
Go away! You're insane! Go away!

1008
01:29:36,384 --> 01:29:38,284
I must kill the police downstairs!

1009
01:29:38,386 --> 01:29:40,479
Sooner or later he'll find out
we've killed Chu, don't you understand?

1010
01:29:40,689 --> 01:29:42,884
Don't you understand?

1011
01:29:57,272 --> 01:29:58,466
You...

1012
01:30:06,514 --> 01:30:10,814
You've shot me already?
What do you scare of?

1013
01:30:11,386 --> 01:30:14,878
There're only two options.
We've only two choices.

1014
01:30:14,989 --> 01:30:19,483
Either we die, or we go away together.

1015
01:30:20,495 --> 01:30:22,190
We've no other alternative.

1016
01:30:31,106 --> 01:30:36,703
Think it carefully,
we've no turning back.

1017
01:30:37,712 --> 01:30:39,703
You've to believe me.

1018
01:30:40,615 --> 01:30:42,515
And I've trust you.

1019
01:30:43,985 --> 01:30:45,976
Put down the gun!

1020
01:30:52,393 --> 01:30:54,293
Put it down!

1021
01:31:22,123 --> 01:31:24,523
Let's start all over again!

1022
01:31:36,938 --> 01:31:39,338
We can start it over!

1023
01:31:39,507 --> 01:31:43,603
We used to have deals between us,

1024
01:31:43,812 --> 01:31:48,613
but it is different now.

1025
01:31:50,051 --> 01:31:55,751
Let's flee together!

1026
01:31:56,991 --> 01:32:02,588
With the 10 million dollars. Let's go!

1027
01:32:12,073 --> 01:32:13,370
You liar!

1028
01:32:25,053 --> 01:32:32,459
Congratulation!
At last you've recovered!
