1
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,120
Hey, Bronc.

2
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,280
Oh, man.

3
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,799
I figured to see you at the stockyard.

4
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,400
You have some trouble?
- Well, no. No, I didn't.

5
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,400
I had a little business in Flagstaff.

6
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,880
Now, how was she?

7
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,690
Now, now, no, we can't keep
the congressman waiting.

8
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,960
Let's go. Yeah.

9
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,000
Yahoo! Here we go.

10
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,650
Hey, Bronc, move them this way.
Move them this way. Look out.

11
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,480
Look out.

12
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,280
Come on. Come on now.

13
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,000
Yahoo!

14
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,640
Move them out.

15
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,420
All right, boys, let's take them home.

16
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,680
Come on.

17
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,440
Turn them in. Yahoo!

18
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,080
Move them out. Come on.

19
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,200
Bring them over here.

20
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,000
Shoot. Missed the brake.

21
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,480
Shut up!

22
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,440
I'm sorry, Mr. Congressman.

23
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,000
Are you really a congressman?
A real one?

24
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,170
- Yes, I am. Now, as I was saying, Mr...
- Is he a real congressman?

25
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,560
Yes, and if you can
make a go of this, Charlie...

26
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:15,679
...you'll be an example
to every other Indian in the territory.

27
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,520
Come on. Oh! Ha-ha!

28
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,200
Oh, don't worry, I'll make a go of it.

29
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,360
I'll make good. Make a go of what?

30
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:27,439
Well, it's really quite simple.
You're in the cattle business.

31
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,240
- Twenty heifers and a young bull, Charlie.
- Purebred Herefords.

32
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,030
- Now, as I told Joe, it's...
- Smoke.

33
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,490
Oh, no, thanks. Now, if you build this herd,
I promise you that I will...

34
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,960
No, no, smoke. Something's on fire.

35
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,560
Fire, hell. That's smoke talk.

36
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,480
Chester Walking Bear
over at Big Springs.

37
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,480
I thought that old dog-eater
was dead by now.

38
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,200
What's it say?

39
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,880
You know I can't read smoke talk.

40
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,680
Lot of good it did to send you to school.
Can't even read your own language.

41
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,400
He say, "Get ready for big whoop-up.
Watch squaws.

42
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,720
Joe Lightcloud coming home."

43
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,040
- Joe coming home? Joe coming home.
- Oh, for heaven's sakes.

44
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:21,239
- Now, that's what I was trying to tell you.
- Annie? She's not home. What you saying?

45
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,439
Joe's bringing your cattle here.

46
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,970
Joe bringing them?
What's Joe got to do with this?

47
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,520
Joe's the one brought up the idea.

48
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,560
- Joe's the one. Your Joe.
- My Joe?

49
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,310
He talked the congressman here
into giving it a try.

50
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,720
I admit I was a bit skeptical at first...

51
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:39,159
...however, he pointed out
certain political advantages to the project.

52
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,360
Providing Charlie can make a go of it.

53
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,320
If you stay out of debt
and the herd prospers, Charlie...

54
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,390
...the government will likely adopt
this policy for the rest of the reservation.

55
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,520
So you see that the future of your
and my fellow Indians is in your hands...

56
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,360
...if you're ready to accept
such a responsibility.

57
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,640
If I'm ready? Hear this, Mr. Congressman.

58
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,880
I, Charlie Lightcloud...

59
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,720
...a direct descendant of great chiefs
and mighty warriors...

60
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,880
...will take care of these fat cows.

61
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,520
And I will raise strong calves.

62
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,200
And when people come to my reservation,
I will point out the fat cows.

63
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,080
I will say, "Do you know
who gave me these fat cows...

64
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,440
...and these strong calves?

65
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,040
My congressman.

66
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,720
And do you know why?

67
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,720
In order to prove
that an Indian can be fine...

68
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,240
...hard-working American citizen.

69
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,040
And not a lazy bum
like some white men think."

70
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,320
Charlie Lightcloud has spoken.

71
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,040
Good. Then it's, uh, settled.

72
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:55,439
All the necessary arrangements
have been taken care of with your son.

73
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,079
If you have any questions at all,
you contact Mr. Slager.

74
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,759
- He's in charge locally.
- All right.

75
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,520
Goodbye and good luck.

76
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,280
He need it.

77
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,840
Uh, we'll see you, Charlie.

78
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:09,919
I don't suppose there's any way to keep
this quiet, just in case it doesn't work out?

79
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,439
Word will spread like wildfire.

80
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,079
There'll be more Indians here
to see Charlie's cows...

81
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,240
...than there were at the Little Bighorn.

82
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,560
- I have good news.
- Get the lard out.

83
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,800
Huh?

84
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:54,759
- In the back seat.
- Oh.

85
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,000
Did you know that was
United States Congressman Morrissey...

86
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,360
...you almost hit out there?

87
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,250
Just because he got elected
to Congress don't mean he owns the road.

88
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,920
And if we don't fix the brakes
on that car...

89
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,039
- Sweetheart...
- lf somebody doesn't do something...

90
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,530
...about this rotten old porch,
it will float away in the next heavy rain.

91
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:16,999
- Don't worry, I'm going to fix it.
- Not that it matters.

92
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,839
It's just the way most everything got
in this house, including me, just floated in.

93
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,580
Wait till you hear what's happened.

94
00:09:22,581 --> 00:09:24,719
- I hope something floats by soon...
- Annie.

95
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,599
...and plugs that hole in the floor
before somebody falls in.

96
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,000
The United States government
is gonna give us a whole herd of cows.

97
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,280
The whole house is coming down
around our ears.

98
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,960
- And a bull. And a bull.
- Windmill is half busted, roof leaks.

99
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,720
And the best part of it is, Annie...
The best part of it... Will you listen?

100
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,560
We got dry rot, wet rot,
old rot, new rot...

101
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,560
Look, the best part of it is...
Annie, listen to me. Annie.

102
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,700
Rotten, that's what it is. Clear through.

103
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,440
- Will you listen? The best part of it is...
- Rotten.

104
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,040
Joe's home,
and he arranged the whole thing.

105
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,280
I heard all about it in town.

106
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,320
- Horse puckey.
- Horse puckey.

107
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,600
No, no, is that any way for a mother
to welcome her only son?

108
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,920
He is not my son.
He is your son and don't you forget it.

109
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,800
Wicked stepmother. Legend speak true.

110
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,760
- Go gather the eggs.
- That's squaw work.

111
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:15,719
Like everything else around here.

112
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,000
Annie, look what this means to us.

113
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,280
Joe got us a herd of cows
of our very own, and they'll multiply...

114
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,000
- ...over and over.
- Along with our problems.

115
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
Charlie, haven't you learned yet?

116
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,680
- But this time, it'll be different.
- Carlos...

117
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,040
...what about the oil well
and the golf course?

118
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,550
We got problems enough
without Joe helping us.

119
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,720
- But, Annie...
- Tongue of viper.

120
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,320
Should strip you naked, paint you red,
horse-drag you across river.

121
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,840
- Now, Grandpa.
- And don't call me Grandpa.

122
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,600
Scorpion squaw
should work more, talk less.

123
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,120
Watch out, old man...

124
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,920
...or I will bury you and that filthy blanket
of yours in the happy hunting ground.

125
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:07,239
Hey, Charlie, you better get that gate open
and turn that gray horse out there.

126
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,759
Don't want him kicking holes
in your new cows, do you?

127
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,040
Hey, Bronco, have you seen Joe yet?

128
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,640
You betcha. He's up on the flats,
headed this way fast.

129
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,080
Giddyup. Let's go.

130
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,080
Get off there.

131
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,800
Get off there. Get off.

132
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,250
- Get on over there.
- Ha-ha-ha!

133
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,160
Look out. Come on back. Come on.

134
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,240
Come on, they're turning. Stop it.

135
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,920
Go on there.

136
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,920
Come on, Bronc.

137
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,680
He's here, Annie. Here they come.

138
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,360
No trouble so far.

139
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:21,599
Hold on there, Charlie.

140
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,679
I wouldn't button that gate up
too tight, if I was you.

141
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,730
Huh?

142
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,970
You got 20 heifers in there,
Mr. Lightcloud.

143
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,280
But I don't see no young bull.

144
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,880
Where is he?

145
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,280
Oh, uh, he'll be along all right.

146
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,640
Woo-hoo!

147
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,040
Look, look.

148
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,760
Oh, Joe.

149
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,120
- Come on, Joe.
- Come on, Joe.

150
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,360
Woo-hoo!

151
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,160
Ride that thing, baby. Woo-hoo!

152
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,200
Woo-hoo!

153
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,120
- Come on, Joe.
- Come on, let's get up here.

154
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,600
Bahh.

155
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,480
He's gonna herd it!

156
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,560
Open the gate,
open the gate, open the gate.

157
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,440
- Come on.
- Open the gate.

158
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,960
Will somebody scratch my back?
I got an itch.

159
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,200
Where's Annie?

160
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:59,719
Where's, uh...? Where's old Grandpa?
Is he still alive?

161
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,840
You damn right he is.

162
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,320
- You don't look a day older.
- Day older than what?

163
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,410
Annie.

164
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,400
Just as good-Iooking as ever.
Pop, you're a lucky guy.

165
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,460
A guy's got a right to hug his mama.

166
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,360
Same old Annie.

167
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,800
Laugh yourself right into the poorhouse.

168
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,880
You have nothing better to do,
but I have work to take care of.

169
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,240
Where's Mary? Where's my baby sister?

170
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,280
Oh, Mary's moved into town.

171
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,360
She's got a job with Mr. Slager
at the First National Bank.

172
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,440
She's city folk now.

173
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:54,559
Yeah, I'll kick the dogs out of her room,
and you can move in.

174
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,519
No, I've been outside so long,
a roof don't feel natural to me.

175
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,320
You sure rode that bull, Joe.

176
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,640
Yeah, Joe, how come
you come riding in on a bull?

177
00:16:05,641 --> 00:16:08,039
Where's that Cadillac
you were gonna bring home?

178
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,319
I got it all right, but it up and quit on me.

179
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,959
Just don't make them like they used to.

180
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,730
Oh, yeah.
Who are you trying to kid? Ha-ha-ha!

181
00:16:17,201 --> 00:16:20,879
Hey, what happened to that saddle
you won for bronco riding in Forth Worth?

182
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,710
That silver studded one?
Did you bring it back with you?

183
00:16:23,711 --> 00:16:26,159
I traded it off to a city fella.

184
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,200
What'd he give you for it?
A pack of gum? Ha-ha-ha!

185
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:31,519
Are you kidding, man?
He gave me his wife.

186
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,280
Ohh!

187
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,320
Hey, Joe, was she pretty?

188
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,040
Hit him up, Joe. Give him what for.

189
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:49,679
What'd you do with that diamond
belt buckle that you won...

190
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,480
...for bulldogging at Madison Square?

191
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,320
He used it as a door handle
on his Cadillac.

192
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,730
Hey, Joe. Does that Cadillac...?
Does it say Ford on the front?

193
00:16:57,731 --> 00:17:01,039
One of these days I'll drive it up here
and take all your squaws away.

194
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,040
- He'd do it too.
- Anytime.

195
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,290
Hey, wait a minute.
Something's missing.

196
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,520
Hi! Ohh.

197
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,600
Hey, down, boy. Private property.

198
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,200
No, beer.

199
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:17,039
Bronc, get over to Glenda Callahan's
and buy up every case of beer she's got.

200
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,800
Sure, Bronc. Just jump
into Joe's Cadillac and take off.

201
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,640
What am I gonna use for money, Joe?

202
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,560
Look.

203
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,520
A hundred dollars.

204
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,200
Holy Custer.

205
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,440
Hey, look, it's $ 100.

206
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,040
You got a match, Bull?

207
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,920
Yeah.

208
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,320
Here.

209
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,880
Hey, Grandpa.
Where's your smoke blanket?

210
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,320
I'm wearing it.

211
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,070
Well, get it working
and send out a signal, Grandpa.

212
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:54,199
Tell them Joe Lightcloud's home.
Tell them we're gonna throw one big party.

213
00:17:55,481 --> 00:17:58,639
Might last a week, a month.
Depends on how long the beer holds out.

214
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,000
Hey, Jackson, cool off.

215
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,840
Hey, hand me a case of that beer.

216
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:13,959
- Hey, one hell of a party, Joe.
- How's the beer holding out?

217
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,919
Well, we're gonna get through the night,
unless old Bull gets a little bit thirsty.

218
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,120
I better go check on him.

219
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,240
- Hey, listen...
- Thanks a lot, old buddy. Thanks a lot.

220
00:20:52,111 --> 00:20:56,839
Jump down spin around, let's have a party

221
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,520
Look who's back, Stay Away Joe

222
00:20:58,521 --> 00:21:00,679
Choctaw, Chickasaw
Gonna drink hearty

223
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,520
Welcome back, Stay Away Joe

224
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,560
Stay Away Joe, they call me

225
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,760
Stay Away Joe, oh, yeah

226
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,760
But if you need me, call me

227
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,120
A whoop and a holler
And I'll be there

228
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,120
Who keeps turning up like a bad penny?

229
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,160
Take one guess, Stay Away Joe

230
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,240
Always finding trouble aplenty

231
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,080
Oh, my, yes, reckon you know

232
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,480
Stay Away Joe, they call me
Stay Away Joe, oh, yeah

233
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,480
But if you need me, call me

234
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,510
A whoop and a holler
And I'll be there

235
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,200
Okay, then, I'll dance with you.

236
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:45,839
When two lips are ripe for the picking

237
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,879
- Who crops up?
- Stay Away Joe

238
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,079
Love them, leave them
Screaming and kicking

239
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,890
Hey, ho, giddyup
Hey, look at him go

240
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,720
Stay Away Joe, they call me
Stay Away Joe, oh, yeah

241
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,000
But if you need me, call me

242
00:21:58,001 --> 00:21:59,959
A whoop and a holler
And I'll be there

243
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,600
Hey.

244
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,800
Well, Mary, you are really something.

245
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,920
Oh, Joe, I missed you. Oh, Joe...

246
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,880
Lorne, this is Joe.

247
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:13,279
I kind of figured it was Joe.
I'm Lorne Hawkins.

248
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,559
Hi. What's this I hear
about you living in town?

249
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,200
Oh, I got a good job.
Never mind about me.

250
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,430
I wanna hear all about your deal
with Congressman Morrissey.

251
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,480
I'll talk to you later about that.

252
00:22:23,481 --> 00:22:25,759
Come on, let's go meet
the rest of the tribe.

253
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,530
- Nice to have met you. See you later.
- See you later.

254
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,240
How are you, Mr. Lightcloud?

255
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,040
Hey, how about a beer?

256
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:39,119
Do you know him, Bronc?
The guy with Mary?

257
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,519
It's Lorne Hawkins.
He bought up a local newspaper.

258
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,440
Welcome home, Joe.

259
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,240
Who was that?

260
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,960
Billie-Jo Hump.

261
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,960
Well, she can chew on my moccasins
any time she wants to.

262
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,640
All right, Joe.
Now, that's Frank Hawk's new girl.

263
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,560
And he watches her like a hawk.

264
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,880
- Is that a fact?
- And...

265
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,090
Joe.

266
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:20,559
What's Hawk gonna say about that?

267
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,960
Well, he don't mind her dancing.

268
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,360
Joe, remember last time.

269
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,960
- Hawk, how's it going, boy?
- Hey, Joe, it's a good party.

270
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,480
That's my new girl over there.

271
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,800
With Jackson He-Crow?

272
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,200
That's her.

273
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,760
Billie-Jo. She's nice, huh?

274
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,400
Man, you better believe it.

275
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,240
I don't know, Hawk.
If she was my girl, I'd...

276
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,840
Well, what do you mean?

277
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,040
Well, I mean, it's nice of you
not to start any trouble or anything.

278
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,480
Well, what's the matter?

279
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,920
What's he doing to her?

280
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,440
If a guy did that without music,
they'd throw him in jail.

281
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,600
That no-good son of an Apache.

282
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,360
- Joe...
- Fight.

283
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,440
Fight. Fight.

284
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,360
Aah!

285
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,320
Annie, great party.

286
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,200
Everybody having fun.

287
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:36,559
Much more of that kind of fun and
the whole house will come down on them.

288
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,920
You fix something to eat?

289
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,520
No, I'm fixing to take a bath.

290
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,940
Wonder how long the fight will last.

291
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,720
Long enough, baby.

292
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,480
- Have you had enough?
- Hell, no.

293
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,440
Hey, everybody, break it up.

294
00:27:02,441 --> 00:27:03,999
Break it up. All right, you guys.

295
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,610
Hey, that's enough.
Break it up, break it up.

296
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,920
Hey, Hawk,
that was a good fight, man.

297
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,360
- I enjoyed it.
- Thanks.

298
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
- Honey, are you all right?
- Uh-huh.

299
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,560
Uh, music. We need some music. Hey.

300
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,040
You guys wanna play something slow?
Everybody looks a little winded.

301
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,240
Joe, same old Joe.

302
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,480
I better talk to you right now.

303
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,320
Do you mind, Lorne?

304
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,520
- Lorne.
- What?

305
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,960
Okay with you if I take a tall, good-Iooking
young man outside for a walk?

306
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,880
Oh, sure, you and Joe go right ahead.

307
00:27:46,571 --> 00:27:54,519
You're really too much. The congressman
actually believes he'll become governor...

308
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,759
...if Charlie succeeds with the herd?
- It's a cheap way to buy votes.

309
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,919
- What if Charlie doesn't succeed?
- He will.

310
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,240
How do you know?

311
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,230
Look what happened
with the golf course and the oil well.

312
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,080
- Well, I was young then, it's...
- Why do you keep coming back, Joe?

313
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,150
Why are you always
trying to help Charlie...

314
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,800
...instead of staying away
and making something of yourself?

315
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,240
Well, maybe it's because I wanna know
this place is still here when I need it.

316
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,680
Demon squaw.

317
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,400
Shame tribe of Lightcloud.

318
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,630
- What's happened now?
- Why don't you find out...

319
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:39,240
...while I rescue a certain white man
from being scalped by wild Indians?

320
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,040
Female Indians.

321
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,730
I am not going to give away
what little food we have...

322
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,000
...to a bunch of drunks.

323
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,160
- You bad Indian.
- Now, Grandpa...

324
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,400
- And don't call me Grandpa.
- She's only half Indian.

325
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,240
And half Mexican,
and proud of it.

326
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,600
Okay, what's wrong now?

327
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,040
We invite friends to celebrate
our great good fortune...

328
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,080
...and this half-breed scorpion squaw
will not feed them.

329
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,720
Be careful or I will
trade places with you...

330
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,800
...and I will serve you for dinner.

331
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,360
Hoo-hoowee!

332
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,720
I ain't had so much beer
in my whole life.

333
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,960
Most of my stomach's growling
like an old hound dog.

334
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,280
What's for chow?

335
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,520
Something else.

336
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,920
In old days, when we have whoop-up,
we have whoop-up.

337
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,560
When friends come to my father's tepee,
they get buffalo.

338
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,760
Big fat buffalo.

339
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,320
Where am I supposed to get buffalo?

340
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,800
Hey, Bronc, old buddy,
I got a job for you.

341
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,040
Lovely.

342
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,560
Hold it.

343
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:36,160
Hey, like I told you,
it's one hell of a party.

344
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,320
- Here's to the future governor.
- Yeah.

345
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,960
Shut up.

346
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,280
I think...

347
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,200
Oh, I think I'm going to die.

348
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,680
Joe?

349
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,920
Joe?

350
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,400
Joe.

351
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,240
Joe?

352
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,200
Yeah, Pop.

353
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,160
Man, ain't it a beautiful morning?

354
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,600
Hey, Annie.
Look out, you'll let the cows out.

355
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,960
Oh, there you are.

356
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,000
What did I do?

357
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,760
Wait a minute.

358
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,520
What did I do, Annie?

359
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,640
Annie. Annie, what's eating you?

360
00:33:54,641 --> 00:33:56,839
You remember the cow
you ate last night?

361
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,080
- Yeah.
- It was the bull.

362
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:03,439
You mean Bronc was so stoned
he couldn't tell the difference?

363
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,720
That's right.

364
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,080
You mean he butchered my bull?

365
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:13,800
When the Congress finds out, they will pass
the law against you, Charlie Lightcloud.

366
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,310
And you will spend
the rest of your life in jail.

367
00:34:16,311 --> 00:34:18,119
Wait a minute, Annie, wait a minute.

368
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,560
I can get you a better one.

369
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,600
What would you say if I were to get you
a big, strong, blue-ribbon stud...

370
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,160
...weighs about 1700 pounds?

371
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,000
I'd say that's a lot of bull.

372
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,000
- So would I.
- Ow!

373
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,440
She'd look good painted red.

374
00:34:33,441 --> 00:34:36,319
Say, where you gonna find
an animal like that?

375
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,120
Hike Bowers over at
the Big Springs Stockyard.

376
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,590
I'll just take a ride over to
Glenda Callahan's and give him a call.

377
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,600
But, son, do you know
how much a herd bull like that cost?

378
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,360
- Five hundred dollars, maybe more.
- Five hundred?

379
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,730
That's peanuts.

380
00:34:51,731 --> 00:34:55,039
Could you let me have a dollar?
I left my money in my other pants.

381
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,640
Sure. Here.

382
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,680
What other pants?

383
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,920
Up jumped the devil.

384
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,760
- How you been, Glenda?
- Can't complain.

385
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,280
- You've been away a long time, Joe.
- Long enough.

386
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,000
I'll bet you didn't give
us folks out here a thought.

387
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,320
Oh, yeah, I did.
I thought about you a lot.

388
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,840
- I'll bet you did.
- No, it's true.

389
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,880
What kind of things
did you think about, Joe?

390
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,040
All sorts of things.

391
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,960
Such as?

392
00:36:04,471 --> 00:36:12,079
Give me some change for a phone call
and a drink, and I'll tell you all about it.

393
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,399
I got no license to sell whiskey
and you know it.

394
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,239
- It never made a difference before.
- They're watching me now.

395
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,920
So it's strictly wine and beer
until they lose interest.

396
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,320
Of course, for you...

397
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,480
...I can make an exception.

398
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,040
- I wouldn't wanna ruin your reputation.
- Don't worry about that.

399
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,680
Now, before you left, we was...

400
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,080
Oh, damn.

401
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,240
Help yourself to a beer.

402
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,480
I'll be right back.

403
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,040
Hello. May I speak
to Hike Bowers, please?

404
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,920
- Tell him Joe Lightcloud's calling.
- Hi, Joe.

405
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,960
What do you know?

406
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,000
- Little Mamie Callahan.
- That's right.

407
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,640
- You've kind of grown up.
- I'm 19 now.

408
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,040
Hey, Joe.

409
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,760
Oh. Oh, yeah, hello. Hike?

410
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,760
Yeah, I got back yesterday.

411
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,010
Listen, Hike, I wonder if I could come over
and talk to you about borrowing a bull?

412
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,200
Yeah, that's right, a bull,
and a good one.

413
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,280
Oh, you have? Great.

414
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,320
Come by later, Hike. Thanks.

415
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,680
What do you need a bull for, Joe?

416
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,640
- I'll explain it to you sometime.
- Over my dead body.

417
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,360
Mamie, you take that shameful thing off.

418
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,880
It's a minidress, I made it myself.

419
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:22,239
Minidress, hell.
It looks like your underwear.

420
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,600
I like it.

421
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,280
Not now, baby.

422
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,360
I can't get over
how much she's grown.

423
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,690
- Out.
- At least let me finish my beer.

424
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,000
- You're gonna ruin your carpet.
- Next time I won't aim so low.

425
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,560
I see what you mean.

426
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,000
Bye, Mamie.

427
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,640
Bye, Joe.

428
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,180
You quit messing around with him.

429
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,240
He reminds me of your father,
that no-account.

430
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,320
Gee, Ma.

431
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,160
Baby, dear. Don't you want to be good?

432
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,960
How am I gonna be good
if I never get any practice?

433
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,670
I'm sure you're gonna be pleased
with your choice, Mr. Lightcloud.

434
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,280
In fact, I'm certain of it.

435
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,640
I sure hope you're right.

436
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,880
Oh, I'd bet my last dollar on it.

437
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:14,960
Now, where's that old one-seater
you're trading in on this little gem?

438
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,120
Right over there.

439
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,320
- Stick them up.
- Joe.

440
00:40:37,321 --> 00:40:40,879
- They finally got you in a cage, didn't they?
- I'm glad you stopped by.

441
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,840
- Morning, Joe.
- Oh, hello, Hy, you old politician.

442
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,980
They haven't caught you yet, have they?

443
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,530
Well, I hear you had
quite a wingding last night.

444
00:40:48,531 --> 00:40:51,119
- Hope the herd's okay.
- Oh, they're a little hung-over.

445
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,480
Cows just can't hold
their beer, you know.

446
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,440
Well, listen, all joking aside...

447
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,560
...this cattle deal's
damned important, you know?

448
00:40:59,561 --> 00:41:02,159
Morrissey's running for governor
means a lot to me.

449
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,679
Now, you just leave everything to me, Hy.
You're practically home free.

450
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,600
I know you, Joe...

451
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,640
...and if you mess this up,
I will have your skin.

452
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,600
Bank's looking great, Hy.

453
00:41:14,601 --> 00:41:18,079
Mary, I wanna show you something
outside. I'll bring her right back.

454
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,680
I have a terrible feeling
before this thing's over...

455
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,720
...I'm going to be feeling terrible.

456
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,470
You're kidding. How'd you do it?
Where'd you get it?

457
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,130
- It was easy. I traded in old Gray for it.
- You did what?

458
00:41:29,131 --> 00:41:32,959
I was talked into it. This fellow needed
one more sale to make his monthly quota.

459
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,240
So you helped him out?
Oh, come on, Joe.

460
00:41:35,241 --> 00:41:37,359
- Who does it really belong to?
- Hey, sis.

461
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,400
What's with you and this Lorne stud?

462
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,280
Well, I told mama last night that...

463
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,200
Holy cow. I forgot the bull.

464
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,440
See you later, sis.

465
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,880
- Hey! Joe, you're looking great.
- Where'd you get that?

466
00:42:08,881 --> 00:42:12,559
- Hank, I ain't seen you in a long time.
- Business is looking pretty good.

467
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,670
I'll show you how good.
Let me buy you a beer.

468
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,680
- I'm on duty.
- I'll tell you what...

469
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,890
...when you get off,
come out to Callahan's.

470
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:21,479
- I'll buy all the brew you can handle.
- See you there.

471
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,360
You too, Bronc. We'll have a party.

472
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,760
Great. But wait...

473
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,000
Where did you get...

474
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,320
...the new car?

475
00:42:48,411 --> 00:42:52,999
Hi, Glenda.
I wanna talk to you about something.

476
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,279
- I told you to stay away.
- I came to help you.

477
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,039
- Hi, Joe.
- Eat your wheat germ.

478
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,510
- Help from you I don't need.
- I was in town just now.

479
00:42:59,511 --> 00:43:01,759
I heard Matson tell Bronc
he's on his way here.

480
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,600
- For what?
- To check the liquor you got, what else?

481
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,920
- I don't believe it.
- Then don't.

482
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,000
- Hi, Joe.
- Make your bed.

483
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,040
- I already made it.
- Then lie in it.

484
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,520
- Go on. Out.
- Mama.

485
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,840
Shut the door.

486
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,800
- Who told him?
- Not me.

487
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,200
I'll bet.

488
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,650
Well, then, why would
I come here to warn you?

489
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,770
What am I gonna do?

490
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,200
- Get out of here, I'll take care of him.
- Oh, no.

491
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,720
Look, I've been thinking
about you and me.

492
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,280
Yeah, I know how you was thinking.

493
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,680
Mamie's nice, but she's just a baby.

494
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,040
I like a woman with maturity.

495
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,480
Uh-huh.

496
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,080
Why don't you take my car
and drive up to Flagstaff?

497
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,960
As soon as I get rid of Hank,
I'll join you there.

498
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,680
- What about Mamie?
- Leave her here.

499
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,520
That'll be the day.

500
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,960
It'll look phony with both of you gone.

501
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,400
Why don't I tell him
you had some shopping to do?

502
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,240
- Forget it.
- Okay.

503
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,240
But I hope you got the stuff hid real good,
because here he comes right now.

504
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,040
Meet you at the Maverick Bar.

505
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,720
- I'm parked out back, the keys are in it.
- Right.

506
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,640
That sure is a funny way to drive a car.

507
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,240
Would you like some yogurt?

508
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,360
No, thanks, baby.

509
00:44:53,361 --> 00:44:56,079
Wasn't that your new car
we just saw leaving?

510
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,240
What new car?

511
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,280
Hey, Hank, let me get you a beer, buddy.

512
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,440
I can't stay too long.
I gotta get on home.

513
00:45:02,441 --> 00:45:05,159
That's too bad,
because we're gonna have a party.

514
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,079
Well, how come you weren't driving?

515
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,000
Here you go, Bronc, go call the tribe.

516
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,920
Because we're gonna
have ourselves a real party.

517
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,110
Hey, everybody, I've brought more booze.
Come and get it.

518
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,680
Booze!

519
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,880
More booze? Ha-ha!

520
00:45:41,881 --> 00:45:46,439
Here we go, everybody,
drink up the evidence...

521
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,879
...so poor Glenda will never
have to sneak off again.

522
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,520
Poor old Glenda, all alone in Flagstaff.

523
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,760
I hope she's having a good time, Joe.

524
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,080
Okay, boys. Don't push.

525
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,520
- There's enough for everybody.
- Joe.

526
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,240
Hey, Bronc, did you ever tend bar?

527
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,440
Uh, nope. Used to be a butcher though.

528
00:46:02,441 --> 00:46:04,319
I know, but now you're a bartender.

529
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,600
- Pass the hat, buddy, let's keep it legal.
- We'll keep it legal.

530
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,440
Holy cow, I forgot the bull. Hey, Bronc.

531
00:46:15,441 --> 00:46:19,119
You want something to drink?
A little fire water, you put it right there.

532
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,239
- Bronc!
- Come on.

533
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,160
You're not the owner! Get out of here!

534
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,520
Bronc.

535
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,200
- Come here, I need your help.
- Yeah? Take care, don't spill it.

536
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,600
Uh, what can I do for you, old buddy?

537
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:32,839
Tomorrow morning
go over to Hike Bowers'...

538
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,200
...and pick up this bull he's got for me.
- His bull? Uh...

539
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,520
What do you need a bull for?

540
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,920
Yeah, yeah.

541
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,160
- Anything you say, Joe.
- Thanks a lot, Bronc.

542
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,240
This is fun.

543
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,960
You say you never
kissed anybody before?

544
00:47:01,961 --> 00:47:04,999
- What's the matter?
- I'm just wondering what you'll be like...

545
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,200
...when you've had a little practice.
- Okay, then, well...

546
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,280
I guess this is what it's like.

547
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,190
- What what's like?
- Being in love.

548
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,920
- Wait a minute, Mamie. We're not...
- Ma won't be back for a long time.

549
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,400
And maybe not even all night.

550
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,600
- Did you hear something?
- More. Come on.

551
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,160
Joe, let's you and me go someplace...

552
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,240
- What's wrong with where we are?
...and get married.

553
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,680
Married?

554
00:48:03,721 --> 00:48:06,839
Well, look, honey,
you just don't up and get married like that.

555
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,370
You gotta plan these things,
you know what I mean?

556
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,880
All right. You gotta get to know
each other better.

557
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,800
Oh, you mean like this.

558
00:49:24,251 --> 00:49:28,119
- Mama.
- I can explain everything.

559
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,000
Meet me in Flagstaff, huh?

560
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:41,200
I'm getting to know him better,
so we can get married.

561
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,760
Mama, don't!

562
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,360
Joe, look out!

563
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,720
Hear me, get out
or I'll clobber you, you lousy...

564
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,800
I got him, Joe. I got the bull.

565
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,680
You stole him, huh?

566
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,600
Just like old days.

567
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,080
Charlie, you're gonna get rich.

568
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,240
- Hey, come on. Come on.
- Oh, good to go.

569
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,920
Annie, you hear that?
You hear that, Annie?

570
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,200
Joe got us a bull.

571
00:50:52,201 --> 00:50:56,599
Best stay away from that tailgate,
he'll charge anything that moves.

572
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,919
Better look out. He sees them heifers,
he'll come like a freight train.

573
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,310
- Ready, Bronc?
- I'm ready.

574
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,080
Okay, here she goes.

575
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,440
- It's coming.
- Yep.

576
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,770
- Everybody stay out of the way.
- Yeah.

577
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,480
Come on.

578
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,160
Come on.

579
00:52:04,191 --> 00:52:07,639
- You gonna take that end?
- Yeah.

580
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,040
I'll take his head,
and you take the other end.

581
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,200
- Be careful.
- Come on, now.

582
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,280
Come on, now. Come on down there.

583
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,520
Come on.

584
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,730
Wait until he gets a look
at them heifers.

585
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,760
Some bull.

586
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:34,760
Hike says he's blue ribbon.
Dominic the Twelfth.

587
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,280
Twelfth? Don't tell me
there was 11 more like him?

588
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:41,159
You shouldn't have said it.
Now he's mad at you.

589
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:45,440
Mad? He look like he's going to cry.

590
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,160
He isn't even looking at them heifers.

591
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,880
He's had a hard day
riding around in that truck.

592
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,560
- Just wait until he gets a little rest.
- It is morning. He just got up.

593
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,240
Looks like good bull. I like him.

594
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,000
Of course you like him.

595
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,880
Only thing around here
that moves slower than you do.

596
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,320
What do you know about bulls?

597
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,840
I know more than he does.

598
00:53:24,841 --> 00:53:28,839
I think he'll come around.
We just gotta get him interested, that's all.

599
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,400
And how are you going to do that?

600
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,760
I'll figure out a way.
Even if I have to show him myself.

601
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,280
Can I watch?

602
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,760
I am not going to wait for you.

603
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,720
Bronc, put one of those cows
on your truck.

604
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,920
Hold it, Bronc. What for?

605
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:46,040
- I am going to sell it and buy a toilet.
- A toilet?

606
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:48,399
Yeah, we've been
through that before, Annie.

607
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,880
I told you, them things have to be
connected up with pipes at both ends...

608
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,600
...and a handle in the middle.

609
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:59,080
I am not going to have
Mary's mother-in-law use no outhouse.

610
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,150
- Come on, Bronc.
- Hold it, Bronc.

611
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,880
Mary's mother-in-law?

612
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,840
Yeah, she's coming here
in two weeks to visit.

613
00:54:05,841 --> 00:54:07,559
But Mary ain't even married.

614
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,880
She's going to be, to Lorne Hawkins.

615
00:54:09,881 --> 00:54:12,039
- Why didn't she tell me?
- She tried...

616
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,640
Come on, Bronc.

617
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,800
- Put one of those cows in your truck.
- Hold it, Bronc.

618
00:54:16,801 --> 00:54:19,279
You can't just go selling off
the herd like that.

619
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,120
Oh, I see. It is all right to eat them,
but not to sell them, is that it?

620
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,750
What else they are good for
with a bull like that?

621
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,040
I got an idea.

622
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:33,480
Why doesn't Mary ask her mother-in-law
to go to the toilet before she leaves town?

623
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,640
Oh, Carlos, you don't ask people
things like that.

624
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,000
You don't even know her.

625
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,320
Besides, I am going to need
many more things before I am through.

626
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,800
Okay, okay. I'll get the money for you,
but leave the herd alone.

627
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,850
- And how you going to do that?
JOE: Never mind, I'll get it.

628
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,610
All right, but if you don't come back
with some money...

629
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,520
...I will keep selling cows
until this house is just the way I want it!

630
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,800
Annie. You woke him up.

631
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,320
Look at that.

632
00:55:04,561 --> 00:55:09,159
Sorry I can't give you anything
for the windshield, Joe.

633
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,320
Too many holes in it.

634
00:55:10,321 --> 00:55:12,719
I was sure hoping we'd get
more dough than this.

635
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,440
Well, spare parts aren't hard
to come by nowadays.

636
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,600
Too many accidents on the highway.

637
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,240
Well, thanks anyway. Come on, Bronc.

638
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,280
See you later, Orville.

639
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,880
I sure hope you know
what you're doing, Joe.

640
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,400
New car and all.

641
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,530
Listen, this money's gonna protect
the prettiest herd of heifers you ever saw.

642
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:03,880
Dominic, Dominic, why are you stalling?

643
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,800
Don't you hear love calling to you?

644
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,480
Move your little foot do

645
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,000
Dominic, Dominic, pick one and take her

646
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,240
There's acres and acres to choose

647
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,680
Only a fool would refuse

648
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,840
If I had your trouble

649
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,600
Life would be double, good sweet

650
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,640
There'd be no grass
Growing under my feet

651
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,760
Listen, Dominic, Dominic
When will you hunger?

652
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,520
You ain't getting younger, my friend

653
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,960
Love, love, love them all
Right to the end

654
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,720
I can't understand you

655
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:05,360
Leaving them beauties forlorn

656
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,000
It's time to take the old bull by the horn

657
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:15,720
Come on, Dominic, Dominic
They're itching and twitching

658
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,040
Better start pitching some woo

659
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:27,240
Move your little foot do

660
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,360
Hello, misfortune

661
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:04,680
How's my old friend Mr. Misery?

662
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,960
I've been away so long

663
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:13,800
I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me

664
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,800
I got no bed to rest my head

665
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,600
No doors or walls or windowpane

666
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,040
Now all I needed was the rain

667
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,920
Rain, rain, rain, rain

668
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:44,080
Met a little honey
At the Buzzin' Bumble Bee Caf

669
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,640
Yes, I did

670
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,000
One drink and all my money

671
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:53,840
And that honeybee had flown away

672
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,840
About as low as I can go

673
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,560
I don't really mean to complain

674
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:08,080
Now all I needed was the rain

675
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,960
Rain, rain, rain, rain

676
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:16,280
All I needed was this rain

677
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,640
All I needed was the rain

678
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,640
Come on, lie down.
There's no problems.

679
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,520
What are you howling about now?

680
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,720
Man, all I needed was you dogs.

681
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,280
Hey, cut it out,
you're getting me all wet.

682
01:03:30,281 --> 01:03:32,759
Get your tail out of my mouth.
Come on, move over.

683
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,630
Get on your own side.
I said, cut it out.

684
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,480
Bull now get up again.

685
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:51,040
He's probably walking in his sleep.

686
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,360
Two-wheeler not look good.

687
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,020
Well, at least it's got a motor.

688
01:04:00,021 --> 01:04:02,639
The car ain't much good anymore,
even for sleeping.

689
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,320
You sleep in hogan with me.

690
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,320
Thanks, Grandpa.

691
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:10,680
Charlie. Carlos, where are you?

692
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:15,480
Darn rain nearly washed
all the stones off of this house.

693
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,920
Where is Grandpa?

694
01:04:17,921 --> 01:04:21,599
Does he has his new clothes on?
They're going to be here any minute.

695
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,240
Well, I'll go get him.

696
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,600
Tell him not to bring
that filthy scalp in this house.

697
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,720
- Oh, Carlos, Carlos.
- Hm?

698
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,840
Did you fill the water tank
on the toilet?

699
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,240
Three buckets full,
she can flush all day.

700
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,480
Old man, go get dressed.

701
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,330
What are you doing out here?

702
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,880
Running away.
I was gonna go out looking for you...

703
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,730
...so as we could go on
getting to know each other better.

704
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:40,280
Well, hop on. I got an errand to run.

705
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,400
I thought you told me
not to expect too much.

706
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:04,200
Apparently they've made a few changes.

707
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,120
Mother, this is Mrs. Hawkins.

708
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,880
- How do you do?
- Mrs. Lightcloud, it's so nice to meet you.

709
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,320
This is my husband, Charles.

710
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,760
Call me Charlie.

711
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,320
Shake...

712
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:23,200
Uh, we have been looking forward
for this day for a long time.

713
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,230
- You all know Lorne.
- Sure do.

714
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,320
- Hello, Lorne.
- Hi.

715
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,950
Charlie. Hey, Mrs. Lightcloud,
the place looks tremendous.

716
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,720
What have you done to it?

717
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,760
Well, we just add a few things
here and there.

718
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,320
Here and there.
You know that we had a lot of cows...

719
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,160
- Will you please come in?
- Thank you.

720
01:06:42,161 --> 01:06:46,639
Don't mind the dogs,
they won't bite you if you don't bite them.

721
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,650
It's beautiful.

722
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,720
I must say it's refreshing
to find such a striking home...

723
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,000
...in the midst of all this wild country.

724
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:06,400
One might almost say
it's an oasis in the desert.

725
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:09,440
- Please make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

726
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:12,240
Isn't this interesting.

727
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,850
Look at the little fan.

728
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,880
Oh, Lorne!

729
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:19,640
Ooh. I forgot to warn you about that.

730
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,420
Didn't have time to have it fixed.

731
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,600
Carlos, help him out of the hole.

732
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,800
- The hole, Carlos.
- It's a little mistake.

733
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,730
- May I take your coat, Mrs. Hawkins?
- Why, no, thank you.

734
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,690
It was rather cool coming out.
I think I'll just leave it on.

735
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,370
- I'll build a fire.
- Aah!

736
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,720
I think a fire would be a lovely idea.

737
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:50,880
Fire? I forgot, we can't have a fire.

738
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,440
Annie made me hide
the old potbellied stove...

739
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:57,000
...out behind the manure...
- Sit down, Mrs. Hawkins.

740
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,090
Maybe you will be
more comfortable on the davenport.

741
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,360
- Thank you.
- Look out for the holes.

742
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,600
Carlos. Carlos.

743
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,120
What?

744
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,560
Fix the hole.

745
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,150
Would you care
for a drink of water, Lorne?

746
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,480
Maybe you would like some tea.

747
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,400
Tea. I'd love some tea.

748
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,360
Mother, wouldn't you like some tea?

749
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,900
If it isn't too much trouble.

750
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,960
Oh, no, no trouble at all.

751
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,280
Well, I'll help you, Mother.

752
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,080
Oh, no. Carlos forget
to hook up the pipes.

753
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:45,560
It's all right, I'll get some outside.

754
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,160
Maria.

755
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:04,160
Will you please forgive the fuss?
We, uh...

756
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,570
Would either of you
like to use the toilet?

757
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,680
Oh, gee, look at the pretty light, Mom.

758
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,720
- Isn't that nice?
- Yes.

759
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,200
Oh, uh...

760
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,600
Maria, I want everything
just right for you.

761
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,440
You are my daughter.
I will do everything for you.

762
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,120
Oh, I know, Mom, it looks wonderful.

763
01:10:19,121 --> 01:10:22,319
But Mrs. Hawkins isn't like that.
You don't need to impress her.

764
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,200
Well, we're sure doing it.

765
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,320
- What happened?
- Me.

766
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,720
He came up on her blind side.

767
01:10:33,721 --> 01:10:36,479
- I'm afraid I forgot to introduce them.
- Here, fix this.

768
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,920
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mrs. Hawkins.

769
01:10:37,921 --> 01:10:40,119
I'm sure Grandpa
didn't mean to startle you.

770
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:43,480
- Scare hell out of her.
- It was silly of me to scream.

771
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:46,880
- Mary.
- How do you do, Mr. Lightcloud?

772
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,120
- Chief Lightcloud.
- Chief.

773
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,520
Grandpa.

774
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:53,840
You stay away from me, old squaw.

775
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,800
Where is your new clothes, Grandpa?

776
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,680
Mail-order suit stink.

777
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,160
Wolf skin and blanket good enough.

778
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,240
It's very colorful.

779
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,320
Is different color on inside.

780
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,000
Grandpa.

781
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:09,360
Um, the tea is going to be ready
in a minute.

782
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,810
- Would you please sit down?
- Well, thank you.

783
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,520
And where is Joe?

784
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,800
I've heard so much about Joe.

785
01:11:15,801 --> 01:11:18,519
- Did you tell him we'd be here?
- Oh, I told him.

786
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:21,640
- She told him to stay away.
- Carlos.

787
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,800
I imagine Joe's pretty busy, Mom.

788
01:11:23,801 --> 01:11:26,679
I'm disappointed I won't have
the opportunity to meet him.

789
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:27,999
You'll meet him.

790
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:34,680
See what I mean,
couldn't get very far in that thing.

791
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,680
But, Joe, the motorcycle
could get us to Flagstaff...

792
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,440
...and they've got ministers there.

793
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,000
Attaboy, Joe.

794
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,320
Is Joe coming in?

795
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,680
He busy.

796
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,600
- Mrs. Hawkins.
- Thank you.

797
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,720
- Grandpa.
- Water? Ah.

798
01:12:11,721 --> 01:12:14,399
Well, that certainly
is a lovely refrigerator.

799
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,880
Should be. Cost half a cow.

800
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,520
Half a what?

801
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:21,720
It is just a little family joke, you know?

802
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,160
Here we go again.

803
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,370
Now what?

804
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,600
Oh, my...! Oh, that's cold.

805
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,880
I'll see you later, maybe.

806
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,960
Mama, don't!

807
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,170
Oh, hello. Excuse me,
I'm sorry I can't stay.

808
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:11,440
Head for outhouse, Joe.
She not look for you there.

809
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,920
Mama, wait. Mama...

810
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,800
Mama.

811
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,200
Mama, will...? What...?

812
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,680
You go that way, I'll head him off.

813
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:57,440
You no-good, cradle-robbing...

814
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,000
...rotten, dirty bum.

815
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,960
It's all right. Mom?

816
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,200
Mama!

817
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,360
Hold it, baby, hold it.

818
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,240
Joe. Hey, you forgot me.

819
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,440
Joe.

820
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,040
Wait for me.

821
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,570
Looks like you and I just weren't
meant for each other, baby.

822
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:32,960
I want to thank you all
for a delightful afternoon.

823
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,880
- I'm so sorry, Lorne.
- Oh, don't be silly.

824
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,840
I didn't realize your family
had such a sense of humor.

825
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,080
Are you coming
back to town with us?

826
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,920
No, I think I'll stay here.
Where I belong.

827
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:51,280
Mrs. Lightcloud, Charlie, Grandpa,
it's been a gas.

828
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,040
I hope to see you all again
before I leave.

829
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,120
You got lot of guts, lady.

830
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,920
Hi.

831
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:20,840
Hi, yourself.

832
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:25,400
I'm sorry I fouled things up
the way I did.

833
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:26,840
It wasn't your fault.

834
01:16:26,841 --> 01:16:29,679
I guess I made an impression
on Lorne's mother, didn't I?

835
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,630
Well, that's the trouble.
We were all trying to impress her.

836
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,440
- You wanna come inside?
- Hm?

837
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,650
Oh, yeah.

838
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,560
Have you talked to Lorne?

839
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,090
I wrote him a letter.

840
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,880
What does that mean?

841
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:48,320
I was wrong, Joe. I realize it now.

842
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:50,080
I'm what I am.

843
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:54,880
No amount of paint and fancy furniture
is gonna change it.

844
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:58,200
I don't belong in Lorne's world.

845
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:01,240
It's just time I stopped
kidding myself about it.

846
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:05,359
If you talked to him, I'm sure you'd find out
you're getting steamed up over nothing.

847
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:08,599
Nothing? Sure. Just a grandfather
who still wants to scalp white men...

848
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,399
Who cares if you live in Lorne's world
or he lives in yours?

849
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,919
If you love each other,
you'll build your own world.

850
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,000
Out of what?

851
01:17:15,001 --> 01:17:19,959
You know what you are?
You're a phony, that's what you are.

852
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:22,559
- You like to feel sorry for yourself.
- Don't lecture me.

853
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,520
Not me. If I goof, I'm not gonna
sit down and lick my wounds.

854
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:28,600
I'm gonna get out and do something
about it. And fast.

855
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,240
Hey, Joe.

856
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:50,240
Hey, don't you say hello
to friends anymore?

857
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,120
Just like old times.

858
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:06,000
- Morning.
- I thought you was my friend, Hike.

859
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,640
You slugged me first.

860
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,240
I'm not talking about that.

861
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,550
I'm talking about that bull
you loaned me.

862
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,040
What about it?

863
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:17,920
- You said he won a bunch of blue ribbons.
- Well, he... Ha-ha-ha!

864
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,920
Well, he did, old buddy.
Well, he did.

865
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,560
For what? Unh! Sleeping?

866
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:29,400
He hasn't even looked at those heifers.

867
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:33,760
Heifers? You mean you wanted
to build a herd?

868
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,400
Well, what else?

869
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,560
What's so funny?

870
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:54,200
You being in rodeo,
I figured you knew.

871
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,200
Knew what?

872
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,400
Dominic the Twelfth.

873
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:05,400
He just happens to be the best
bucking bull in the Eastern circuit.

874
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,080
He ain't never been rode.

875
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:11,720
Is that a fact?

876
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,920
Wait a minute, hold it down.

877
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:28,840
Wait a minute, hold it down.
I'll say it again.

878
01:19:28,841 --> 01:19:32,079
I'm willing to bet there's not
a man here that's cowboy enough...

879
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,560
...to ride this old bull of mine.

880
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:38,040
I got 10-to-1 that says
that he can't be rode.

881
01:19:38,041 --> 01:19:39,919
Ten to one? You must be kidding.

882
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,520
- Is that to a standstill?
- Nope, to a whistle. Eight seconds.

883
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:46,120
- You putting us on?
- Lf I am, he'll throw you off.

884
01:19:46,121 --> 01:19:49,319
- And I'll bet double that I can ride it.
- That part of the deal?

885
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,879
If I don't go the distance, you collect.
Help pay your hospital bill.

886
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:55,270
Let me have 100 of that.

887
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,200
Looks good, looks good.

888
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,680
Oh, hello, boys. Excuse me.

889
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:07,800
BULL: We wanna talk with you, Joe.
- What about?

890
01:20:07,801 --> 01:20:10,079
Oh, a little personal matter
we wanna settle.

891
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,959
- You've been going out with our girls.
- We seen you with them.

892
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,720
Darn near ran me down.

893
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,720
Well, uh, look, fellas...

894
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,320
...I gotta go.

895
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,480
We'll get him at the main gate,
after the rodeo.

896
01:20:27,481 --> 01:20:30,359
- Hi, Joe.
- How are you?

897
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:33,010
Well, don't you two look cute?
What's the occasion?

898
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,320
Mamie's getting married.

899
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,120
- Oh, yeah? To who?
- You.

900
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:39,200
Right after the fair,
we'll meet you at the gate...

901
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:44,720
...drive over to Judge Nibley's,
and he'll issue a license or lock you up.

902
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,640
- Come on, Mamie.
- Bye, Joe.

903
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,600
Look at that, Joe. We got enough money
to buy every cow in Arizona.

904
01:20:55,591 --> 01:21:02,959
Now, folks, you're not gonna
find the next entry in your program...

905
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,430
...but I guarantee you
we're gonna have a few laughs.

906
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,970
We have a cowboy who seems
to wanna give money away.

907
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,650
And some of our riders are gonna do
what they can to accommodate him.

908
01:21:11,651 --> 01:21:14,279
Now, let me call your attention
to chute number three.

909
01:21:15,361 --> 01:21:17,279
We present Dominic the Twelfth.

910
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,840
The world's most dangerous bull...

911
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,920
...if we can wake him up.

912
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:08,320
And now, folks,
we have a surprise for you.

913
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:10,680
To prove that Dominic
can really be ridden...

914
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:13,760
...and he's willing to put up
all his winnings to prove it...

915
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,960
...coming out of chute number four...

916
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:19,640
...the pride of Calgary, Cheyenne
and Madison Square Garden...

917
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:23,040
...Arizona's own Joe Lightcloud.

918
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:29,160
Take it away, Joe.

919
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:33,210
Hang on there, baby.

920
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,920
Mama, he could get killed.

921
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,360
He should be so lucky.

922
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:44,280
Joe, do you see me?

923
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,240
Get in there, Joe. Stay on there.

924
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,800
Cowboy Joe.

925
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,520
- Hey, we did it.
- We did it. Ha-ha!

926
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:08,240
That's all of the money in the world.

927
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,800
You did it. We did it. We did it.

928
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,240
Hold it, Bronc.

929
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:35,279
- Where is he?
- Now, listen...

930
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,040
...we were here first. Where is he?

931
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,800
Well, he'll be along soon.

932
01:23:38,801 --> 01:23:42,479
He had to go by the first-aid station
to get something for, uh, rope burn.

933
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:46,279
He'll have more than that to
worry about if he tries to sneak out on us.

934
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:49,720
You wouldn't be trying to pull something
on us, would you, Bronc?

935
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,600
What you got in back?

936
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:54,920
It's just old Dominic.

937
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:57,360
Yeah, it's just old Dominic.

938
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,160
All right, I'm leaving.

939
01:24:00,161 --> 01:24:02,959
Look, if you see Joe, tell him
I'll meet him downtown, will you?

940
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:20,680
Oh, Joe...
Joe wouldn't take off like that.

941
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:24,640
- Not without saying goodbye.
- Why not? He did it before.

942
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,920
Well, what are we
gonna do now?

943
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:31,040
Go to jail for sell government cows.

944
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:34,760
- Where is he?
- Out here.

945
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:37,960
- I say how to Lorne.
- Lorne?

946
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,240
Mary, I wanna talk to you.

947
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,840
Come in, Lorne.

948
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,360
Nice of you to drop by.

949
01:24:44,361 --> 01:24:48,319
- Mary, will you open up this door?
- No, go away. I don't wanna see you.

950
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,879
Will you open up the door
and stop acting like a child?

951
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,680
Oh, no, she doesn't mean it.
She's just putting on a show.

952
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:57,160
Show gets better.
Here come congressman.

953
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,710
- Carlos.
- What?

954
01:24:59,711 --> 01:25:02,119
- Carlos, let me do the talk.
- All right.

955
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:05,720
And maybe I can save you
from going to jail.

956
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,160
Carlos.

957
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,640
Charlie.

958
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:28,400
Mr. Congressman, Mr. Slager, hello.

959
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,840
I see you've made a number
of improvements in the house.

960
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,890
Well, I just added little Mexican
touches here and there.

961
01:25:34,891 --> 01:25:37,199
There is a story
going around town, Charlie...

962
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,679
That your cattle are showing up
at the stockyards.

963
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:41,160
Now, I'm sure you can explain.

964
01:25:41,161 --> 01:25:43,519
- Where is the herd, Charlie?
- I can explain.

965
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:44,879
Where is the herd, Charlie?

966
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,079
- They're out on the range somewhere.
- Right.

967
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:50,039
- Wrong. You tell us the truth.
- Mr. Congressman, I can explain.

968
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:52,040
Let him speak.

969
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:01,800
Uh...

970
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,000
He cannot speak.

971
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,640
Uh, where?

972
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:14,320
You've sold them.

973
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:19,000
This is gonna be very hard to explain
back in Washington.

974
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:22,000
He not so good explaining it here.

975
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,800
Just open the door and let me talk.

976
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,570
- Just for a minute.
- No, I won't.

977
01:26:25,571 --> 01:26:28,399
Mary, you sent me that letter,
and it doesn't make sense.

978
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,639
- It does make sense.
- Mary, will you open the...?

979
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:32,840
Mary... Will you open
the door, Mary, please?

980
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,680
I'll have you all in jail.

981
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,600
You have destroyed our careers.

982
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,800
I mean, the governor's.

983
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:42,040
The congressman's.

984
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,960
It is entirely your fault, Charlie.

985
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:48,040
Selling government cattle
for your own personal gain...

986
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:52,120
...is an out-and-out crime against
the United States of America.

987
01:26:52,121 --> 01:26:53,719
You're a disgrace to the Indian...

988
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:58,760
The Indian na...

989
01:27:02,521 --> 01:27:04,919
Mary, I know you're in there. I can see you.

990
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:08,640
You can't get out the other way.
If you try and get out, I'll go around.

991
01:27:15,571 --> 01:27:22,879
- What are you doing with my cars?
- Loan company told me to pick them up.

992
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,999
You tell them I'm gonna report them
to the Better Business Bureau.

993
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,720
Looks like you've got
a little explaining to do, Joe.

994
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,680
What about? Turning 20
head of cows into a hundred?

995
01:27:31,681 --> 01:27:34,159
- Those are yours?
- Nope, they belong to my father.

996
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:35,400
Here's a bill of sale.

997
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,610
I'd say this makes you
the biggest cattleman...

998
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:45,240
...in the 23rd district, Mr. Lightcloud.

999
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,790
- Kind of makes you feel warm, don't it?
- Yes, yes, you could say that.

1000
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,640
Come along, Mr. Slager,
we've got work to do.

1001
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,240
Now, I want the newspapers
to know about this.

1002
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,300
Photographs, interviews, the works.

1003
01:27:59,301 --> 01:28:02,399
We might even get the television station
in Phoenix to cover it.

1004
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,479
This is the greatest thing
that could ever have happened to us.

1005
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:06,959
Look at all the other people.

1006
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,370
- Look at John Smith and Pocahontas...
- Oh, Lorne!

1007
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,680
My son, my son.

1008
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,160
My son.

1009
01:28:18,161 --> 01:28:20,239
Don't worry, Annie, things will get worse.

1010
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:21,400
You better believe it.

1011
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:31,040
- Will you...? Will you listen to me?
- Stop.

1012
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:32,560
Ow! Mary.

1013
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:39,120
Aah! Come on, come on.

1014
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:46,720
I told you everything
would be all right. Look out.

1015
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,280
We can eat again.

1016
01:28:54,911 --> 01:28:58,399
All right, judge, there he is.

1017
01:28:58,400 --> 01:28:59,840
Well, here we go again.

1018
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:01,330
Come on, Joe.

1019
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:03,600
- You come right here with me...
- Why?

1020
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,600
...and stand over there. Right there.

1021
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:08,520
Mamie, stand there and hold his hand.

1022
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:12,320
Here, Bronc, take this,
and you go over on the other side.

1023
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,080
All right, judge, let's go.

1024
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,640
- Go? Go where?
- Highly unusual.

1025
01:29:16,641 --> 01:29:19,199
But I am empowered
under statute number...

1026
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:20,719
- Joe, we have to get married.
- Huh?

1027
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:23,040
I've never been so shamed
in my entire life.

1028
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,430
What'd you tell her I did?
All we did was kiss.

1029
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:26,600
Start the ceremony.

1030
01:29:26,601 --> 01:29:29,759
- We are gathered here...
- Wait a minute.

1031
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,440
No wait.

1032
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,200
- Keep going.
- Yeah.

1033
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:34,560
Well...

1034
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:37,720
I'm going now.
I'll see you around, okay? Bye.

1035
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,280
- Aha! Mary!
- Aah!

1036
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:56,400
Do you, Joe, take Mamie
to be your lawfully wedded wife...

1037
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:59,280
...to love and to cherish
as long as you both shall live?

1038
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,240
- No.
- Yes.

1039
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,420
Now, this is highly improper, you know?

1040
01:30:03,421 --> 01:30:07,679
Uh, do you, Mamie, take Joe
to be your lawfully wedded husband...

1041
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:11,200
...to love and to cherish
as long as you both shall live?

1042
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:13,120
Excuse me, judge, I gotta run.

1043
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:14,870
Pardon me, ma'am.

1044
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:24,520
- Nice try, Joe.
- A man's gotta try.

1045
01:30:29,451 --> 01:30:34,679
If you don't open the door,
I'll break the thing down!

1046
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:37,570
If you break it down, I'll hit you
in the head with a chair!

1047
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,440
What do we do now?

1048
01:30:41,441 --> 01:30:44,479
Wait till they finish,
then we'll go on with the ceremony.

1049
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,120
I'm afraid that's impossible.

1050
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:49,080
Excuse me.

1051
01:30:49,081 --> 01:30:51,839
Now, that boy claims
that he only kissed your daughter.

1052
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,890
- And l...
- That's right, and Mama said that...

1053
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,720
Look, I'll decide.

1054
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,520
That's right?

1055
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,720
Is that all you did, is kiss him?

1056
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:05,400
Mama, you said that if I kissed a boy,
I would get in trouble.

1057
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:10,000
Mamie, you and me are gonna have
a good long talk about the facts of life...

1058
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:12,630
...and you're gonna tell me
how you think it happens.

1059
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:16,120
- What happens?
- Baby, dear, get in the car.

1060
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:52,400
JOE: Bye, Mamie.
- Bye, Joe.

1061
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:03,360
Get up. Fight for honor of tribe.

1062
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:13,640
Thank you, sir.

1063
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,520
Mary, just open the door.

1064
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:42,930
Mary, I love you.

1065
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:44,880
Mary, will you come out?

1066
01:32:44,881 --> 01:32:47,639
- You all right, buddy?
- Yeah, that big clown stepped on...

1067
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:49,880
Open the... Mary.

1068
01:32:49,881 --> 01:32:53,439
You can give me a hundred reasons why
it won't work, but I'll marry you.

1069
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:54,680
You tell her, Lorne.

1070
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:05,280
What are you helping him for?
We saw him out with your girl too.

1071
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:16,910
- Oh, Joe, I'm sorry...
- That's all right. It clears the head a bit.

1072
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,560
Hey, Lorne, get her out of here.

1073
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,480
- Aah! No!
- I'm gonna marry you.

1074
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:23,090
Let me go.

1075
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:26,080
Mary, I love you!

1076
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:40,960
Joe.

1077
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:46,120
Where did he go? Joe?

1078
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:48,240
Don't let Joe...

1079
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:53,040
Joe?

1080
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,160
I got him.

1081
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:02,600
Don't let him get away.

1082
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:04,920
Stop that Indian-chasing man!

1083
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:13,520
Man, that's what I call
one hell of a fight.
