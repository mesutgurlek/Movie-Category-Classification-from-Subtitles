1
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:44,596
I'm going to take the elevator.

2
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:51,044
- What floor is Ezra Ounce on?
- Why, the Ezra Ounce floor.

3
00:01:51,214 --> 00:01:54,980
Take this elevator to the 25th floor
then take the special tower elevator.

4
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:57,620
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

5
00:02:07,364 --> 00:02:09,594
I beg pardon,
which is the tower elevator?

6
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:12,564
- Did you wish to see Mr. Ezra Ounce?
- Yes, sir.

7
00:02:21,978 --> 00:02:23,639
Have you an appointment?

8
00:02:23,814 --> 00:02:26,408
- Yes, sir.
- Have you any identification?

9
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,416
Ezra Ounce is my wife's cousin.

10
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,284
Mr. Horace P. Hemingway
of New York City to see Mr. Ounce.

11
00:02:34,424 --> 00:02:37,518
Mr. Horace P. Hemingway
of New York City to see Mr. Ounce.

12
00:02:37,694 --> 00:02:40,390
- <i>Send him up.</i>
- Send him up.

13
00:02:40,764 --> 00:02:43,927
- That way, please.
- Yes, sir.

14
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:57,036
- Pistol?
- Kidnappers.

15
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:10,020
Mr. Horace P. Hemingway
of New York City to see Mr. Ounce.

16
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,358
Mr. Horace P. Hemingway
of New York City to see Mr. Ounce.

17
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,623
- <i>Send him in.</i>
- Take him in.

18
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,004
Electricity.

19
00:03:25,642 --> 00:03:29,544
Mr. Horace P. Hemingway of New York City
has an appointment to see Mr. Ounce.

20
00:03:37,487 --> 00:03:41,617
Cousin Ezra, that is, Mr. Ounce,
sent for me to come from New York.

21
00:03:41,792 --> 00:03:44,488
You are three and one-half minutes early.

22
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:46,629
This is the first time that Cousin Ezra...

23
00:03:46,797 --> 00:03:49,027
...Mr. Ounce
has sent for me in 20 years.

24
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,102
March 8, 1912, you had
an appointment at 10:23 a.m.

25
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:56,466
You stayed four minutes.

26
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,044
Yes. He had heard that I'd had a baby.
That is, my wife, Mathilda, had it.

27
00:04:02,212 --> 00:04:04,146
He wanted to add it to the family tree.

28
00:04:04,314 --> 00:04:07,477
Girl. Name: Barbara.
Weight: Five pounds.

29
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:11,883
Complexion: Undetermined. Hair: Bald.

30
00:04:12,055 --> 00:04:16,389
Yes. Barbara took after me at first.
She was born bald.

31
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:19,658
She's got hair now.

32
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,826
- Fortunate.
- She's 22 now.

33
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:26,435
Twenty-two years, two months,
three days is correct.

34
00:04:26,603 --> 00:04:29,367
Cousin Ezra wasn't very happy
about her being a girl.

35
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:32,406
Mr. Ounce does not approve of females.

36
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:37,371
I'm, that is, we're sorry
we couldn't have given him a boy.

37
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:40,042
It is time for your appointment.

38
00:04:40,217 --> 00:04:44,916
Mr. Ounce is very particular as to
punctuality. Mr. Ounce is waiting.

39
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:47,022
Oh, thank you.

40
00:04:53,697 --> 00:04:55,631
Electricity.

41
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,167
You told me the tire
would run 10,000 miles.

42
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:01,202
Now, what happened? It blew out.
I don't want a new tire.

43
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:05,432
I want my $ 18.75. If I don't get it back,
I'm gonna sue you.

44
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:08,544
Cousin Ezra, it's been 20 years since...

45
00:05:08,712 --> 00:05:10,646
He told me the tire
would run 10,000 miles.

46
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:13,840
What happened? It only ran 9998 miles.

47
00:05:14,017 --> 00:05:16,542
It's dishonest. False representation,
that's what it is.

48
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,053
I don't want a new tire. Sounds eccentric
but I can afford to be.

49
00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:21,554
I've got $35 million.

50
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:24,489
You haven't got $35 million.
You can't afford to be eccentric.

51
00:05:24,661 --> 00:05:27,755
- What are you shaking your head for?
- I can't afford to be eccentric.

52
00:05:27,931 --> 00:05:29,956
- That's what I said.
- That's what I mean.

53
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,867
Well, why didn't you say so?

54
00:05:33,103 --> 00:05:35,298
Mathilda and Barbara
send their love to you.

55
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:38,173
- Barbara sends her love to me?
- Yes, Ezra.

56
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:40,832
Why should she send her love to me?
She's never seen me.

57
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:42,569
Well, she's seen your picture.

58
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:44,577
She's sending her love to my picture.

59
00:05:44,748 --> 00:05:48,184
No, no, you see. We've told her,
that is, she knows all about you.

60
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:49,875
Sit down.

61
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:09,802
I've prepared a questionnaire. And if you
answer the questions to my satisfaction...

62
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:12,032
- Yes, Ezra?
...to my entire satisfaction...

63
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,904
...I may have an important
decision to announce.

64
00:06:16,346 --> 00:06:18,007
Hemingway questionnaire.

65
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:24,618
Do you promise to tell the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth?

66
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:26,153
I do.

67
00:06:27,057 --> 00:06:29,048
Are you a moral man, Mr. Hemingway?

68
00:06:29,225 --> 00:06:31,125
Well, I like to think so.

69
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:34,286
- Well, don't you know?
- Oh, yes, yes, I'm a moral man.

70
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,960
- Have you ever touched liquor or nicotine?
- Never.

71
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,865
Have you ever purposely sinned?

72
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:44,836
No, not much, on purpose.

73
00:06:45,108 --> 00:06:47,338
Have you ever dawdled
with the idea of sinning?

74
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,671
Now, Ezra, you know I never dawdle.

75
00:06:50,046 --> 00:06:52,310
- Answer me, yes or no.
- No.

76
00:06:57,554 --> 00:06:59,579
- Yes, Mr. Ounce?
- Listen carefully, Horace...

77
00:06:59,756 --> 00:07:02,384
...and you'll understand
my decision. The family tree.

78
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:04,049
Yes, sir.

79
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:12,424
This is the Ounce family tree.

80
00:07:12,602 --> 00:07:15,435
Here's Mr. Ounce coming right up
out of the trunk.

81
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:18,167
This is Mathilda Ounce Hemingway...

82
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:19,638
...out on this limb.

83
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:21,572
You married this limb.

84
00:07:22,512 --> 00:07:25,572
And this twig sprouting here
is Miss Barbara.

85
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:27,582
Show him the withered branches.

86
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:31,414
Mr. Ounce has looked with horror
on the rotten branches of his family tree...

87
00:07:31,588 --> 00:07:33,249
...if I might use the term.

88
00:07:33,423 --> 00:07:35,118
Bad banana in every bunch.

89
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:38,920
There is only one more living fruit
of the Ounce family tree...

90
00:07:39,095 --> 00:07:41,256
...and that is bad fruit.

91
00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:45,059
James Higgens, over here,
has succumbed to the stage...

92
00:07:45,235 --> 00:07:48,068
...in defiance of Mr. Ounce's
known wishes in the matter.

93
00:07:48,405 --> 00:07:51,101
James "Bad Fruit" Higgens, an actor.

94
00:07:52,609 --> 00:07:55,339
And have you barred
said James Higgens from your home...

95
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:59,642
...pursuant to Mr. Ounce's memorandum,
January 13, 1930?

96
00:07:59,816 --> 00:08:02,080
- I have.
- You'd better.

97
00:08:02,252 --> 00:08:06,279
Very well, Mr. Hemingway. Mr. Ounce
has decided not to wait until he dies...

98
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:07,946
...before dividing his fortune.

99
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:10,490
He's going back
to New York with you tonight.

100
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,390
There he will liquidate $ 10 million...

101
00:08:13,563 --> 00:08:15,758
...and give it to your wife and yourself.

102
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:18,492
Ten million dollars.

103
00:08:18,668 --> 00:08:19,896
What about it?

104
00:08:20,303 --> 00:08:24,171
- That's very nice of you, Ezra.
- Yes, but if I find out you haven't...

105
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,501
...answered the questions truthfully...
- Ezra.

106
00:08:26,676 --> 00:08:29,873
If I find your moral life is nothing
more than a snare and a delusion...

107
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:31,843
...I'll cut you off like a ripe banana.

108
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:34,540
Yes, Ezra, like a ripe banana.

109
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,381
James "Bad Fruit" Higgens.
Take a look at that.

110
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,983
Destroy this. He's no longer an Ounce.

111
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:02,067
Like to hear a little secret?
I love you.

112
00:09:02,245 --> 00:09:05,772
Jimmy Higgens, why all this love
and affection? Have you got a job?

113
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:07,541
Do I have to have a job to love you?

114
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,976
No, but I'd like to hear both.

115
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:12,883
Well, I haven't got a job.
Nothing but love.

116
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:15,991
Thirty-four shows in New York
and not a one of them aching for me.

117
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,457
You'll get there yet.
You just keep trying.

118
00:09:18,628 --> 00:09:21,461
Honey, a couple of boys
and myself are writing our own show.

119
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:25,397
You should have waited until Uncle Ezra
died before you went on the stage.

120
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:29,334
I'd have been playing old-man parts by then.
Besides, I don't want any of his money.

121
00:09:29,506 --> 00:09:33,306
I only want to do the things I like,
and kiss the girl I love.

122
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,946
It doesn't seem right, our loving each other
like we do, being related and everything.

123
00:09:42,118 --> 00:09:44,518
Related? We're 13th cousins.

124
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:46,314
- Thirteenth?
- Thirteenth.

125
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:50,823
- Say, is that bad luck?
- Nothing's bad luck, sitting here like this.

126
00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:55,264
- Too hot?
- Of course not.

127
00:09:55,431 --> 00:09:57,126
- That spot...
- So what?

128
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,269
<i>It's a precious souvenir to me</i>

129
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:02,832
- <i>In love?</i>
- <i>In strong</i>

130
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:04,769
<i>With me? How long?</i>

131
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:08,672
<i>Oh, since you were about</i>
<i>Now, let me see</i>

132
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:12,276
- <i>'Bout 8? 'Bout 10? 'Bout 12?</i>
- <i>No</i>

133
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:17,647
- <i>Well, when?</i>
- <i>I'll tell you very confidentially</i>

134
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:22,681
<i>When you were a smile</i>
<i>on your mother's lips</i>

135
00:10:22,859 --> 00:10:26,386
<i>And a twinkle in your daddy's eye</i>

136
00:10:26,563 --> 00:10:29,930
<i>I loved you then</i>
<i>I loved you when</i>

137
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:33,591
<i>You were a little tender sigh</i>

138
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,671
<i>When I was a babe in my mother's arms</i>

139
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,206
<i>I would wake up with a lonely cry</i>

140
00:10:40,376 --> 00:10:42,503
<i>I cried for you</i>

141
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:47,582
<i>They never knew</i>
<i>They thought it was my lullaby</i>

142
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,982
<i>I gave up every little toy</i>

143
00:10:52,155 --> 00:10:54,350
<i>I played no game</i>

144
00:10:54,524 --> 00:10:58,790
<i>I was a lonely little boy</i>

145
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:02,329
<i>Until you came</i>

146
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:04,090
<i>The days flew apart</i>

147
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:05,894
<i>You were in my heart</i>

148
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:09,300
<i>And I waited for the stork to fly</i>

149
00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:13,406
<i>When you were a smile</i>
<i>On your mother's lips</i>

150
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:19,971
<i>And a twinkle in your daddy's eye</i>

151
00:11:24,454 --> 00:11:26,684
No. That way.

152
00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:36,823
Up.

153
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:40,232
Careful.

154
00:11:42,372 --> 00:11:44,567
Oh, Barbara.

155
00:11:46,342 --> 00:11:48,537
Barbara, guess what?

156
00:11:48,711 --> 00:11:51,839
Cousin Ezra is on his way
form Buffalo with father.

157
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:55,644
- And he's gonna give us $ 10 million.
- What's he gonna give Jimmy?

158
00:11:55,818 --> 00:11:59,447
Don't you dare breathe that young
reprobate's name to Cousin Ezra.

159
00:11:59,622 --> 00:12:03,558
My, your father has dreamed of this moment
ever since we were married.

160
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:06,320
That's all you've talked about
as long as I can remember.

161
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:09,363
But just think. Ten million dollars.

162
00:12:09,532 --> 00:12:13,195
Oh, I can hardly wait to see
dear, dear Ezra.

163
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:19,736
I'd rather see Jimmy once
than that old ruin 10 million times.

164
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:22,673
Barbara, that's almost sacrilege.

165
00:12:22,845 --> 00:12:26,337
Yes, and I wish Uncle Ezra would hurry
and get here so I could tell him so.

166
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:27,777
Barbara.

167
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:36,483
Laura, how could
you do this to Cousin Ezra?

168
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:37,921
Come on, get up.

169
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,663
Barbara will be glad to see you, Ezra.

170
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:49,862
Why not? And I've got some
good news for you and Mathilda.

171
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:54,032
While I liquidate $ 10 million, I've decided
to spend about a month at your house.

172
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,043
Oh, that is good news, Ezra.

173
00:12:57,213 --> 00:13:01,172
New York City reeks with sin, especially
the hotels. I wouldn't go near any of them.

174
00:13:01,351 --> 00:13:03,216
Oh, you're right, Cousin Ezra.

175
00:13:03,386 --> 00:13:04,614
And here's something else.

176
00:13:04,787 --> 00:13:07,915
I shall take a second 10 million
to form the O.F. For the E. Of A.M.

177
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:09,649
- The what?
- The Ounce Foundation...

178
00:13:09,826 --> 00:13:11,623
...for the Elevation of American Morals.

179
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:15,093
You can elevate a lot of morals
for $ 10 million, Ezra.

180
00:13:15,264 --> 00:13:19,724
New York City is a hotbed of vice.
We'll start with New York and work west.

181
00:13:19,902 --> 00:13:21,927
- Very commendable.
- Mathilda can work south.

182
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:23,800
I'll give her the southern territory.

183
00:13:23,973 --> 00:13:26,339
- Mathilda will appreciate that very much.
- Yeah?

184
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:29,637
She's always been interested
in reforming everything.

185
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:35,339
Ten o'clock. Past our bedtime.
Come, Horace.

186
00:13:36,386 --> 00:13:39,446
Bulger. Bodyguard.

187
00:13:46,229 --> 00:13:47,992
Stop that, you old roué, you.

188
00:13:48,164 --> 00:13:51,361
Did you see her trip me? Come, Horace.

189
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,794
Shows you how careful one must be.

190
00:13:55,972 --> 00:13:58,304
You're a good, clean moral man,
aren't you, Horace?

191
00:13:58,474 --> 00:14:00,908
- Oh, yes, indeedy.
- Well, see that you remain that way.

192
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:04,274
We must prepare for the battle in New York.
Sleep well, Horace.

193
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:07,280
- Good night, Ezra.
- Good night. Come, Bulger.

194
00:14:19,862 --> 00:14:23,298
- Oh, the wrong room.
- No, it isn't my room. It must be yours.

195
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:26,333
- No, it's not mine.
- Well, look.

196
00:14:31,307 --> 00:14:33,275
- It is mine.
- Good.

197
00:14:33,443 --> 00:14:35,206
What are you doing in my compartment?

198
00:14:35,378 --> 00:14:39,337
I was with a burlesque show. We were
stranded and laid an egg in Troy, see?

199
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:41,449
- I don't see it at all.
- It's very simple.

200
00:14:41,617 --> 00:14:43,482
This is better than walking to New York.

201
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:46,679
- Y... You get out of here.
- Why? I don't snore.

202
00:14:46,856 --> 00:14:48,619
Snore?

203
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:57,891
One, two, one, two.

204
00:14:58,067 --> 00:15:01,264
One, two, one, two. Well, Horace.

205
00:15:01,437 --> 00:15:03,166
I thought you were in bed.

206
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:07,537
No, I'm not in bed. I came out
to get some air. You're not in bed.

207
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:11,146
My compartment was too small so I came
down to exercise. It's good for you.

208
00:15:11,314 --> 00:15:15,341
Stimulates the digestion, strengthens
the corpuscles. One, two, one, two.

209
00:15:17,353 --> 00:15:20,083
I've overdone it. Athlete's stomach.

210
00:15:20,256 --> 00:15:21,621
Must go to bed, Horace.

211
00:15:23,693 --> 00:15:25,490
Come, Bulger.

212
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:28,622
Well, here's your compartment, Horace.

213
00:15:28,798 --> 00:15:32,029
This should've been mine.
"E" stands for Ezra. Do you get it?

214
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:35,799
- Good night, Cousin Ezra.
- Good night, Horace.

215
00:15:46,582 --> 00:15:49,915
Oh, I thought there was a catch in this.
Indian giver, huh?

216
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:51,917
Get out of here,
I'll call the conductor.

217
00:15:52,088 --> 00:15:55,319
Call him. I'll tell him we got on at Buffalo
and that you got cold feet.

218
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:58,016
I'll make a scandal to shake
this rattler off its tracks.

219
00:15:58,194 --> 00:15:59,957
- Oh, no.
- I think I'll start screaming.

220
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:03,257
Oh, no, no, no. Stay right here.
Make yourself at home.

221
00:16:03,432 --> 00:16:06,401
Wild horses couldn't keep me in here.

222
00:16:16,412 --> 00:16:18,277
Mr. Hemingway.

223
00:16:18,881 --> 00:16:20,974
Is there anything wrong
with your compartment?

224
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,614
Oh, it's full of rats.

225
00:16:25,421 --> 00:16:26,445
I see.

226
00:16:26,622 --> 00:16:28,954
I'm not a drinking man myself,
but I'm broad-minded.

227
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:32,891
Yes, sir. I had a cousin
used to see rats. Pink ones.

228
00:16:33,062 --> 00:16:35,963
- Come on, you better go to bed.
- No, no, I refuse to go to bed.

229
00:16:36,132 --> 00:16:38,259
Will you go quietly,
or must I call Mr. Ounce?

230
00:16:38,434 --> 00:16:41,130
Oh, no, no. I'll go quietly.

231
00:17:58,347 --> 00:18:02,374
Mathilda, I shall appoint you first-crusading
vice president of the Ounce Foundation.

232
00:18:02,785 --> 00:18:05,185
Well, what do I do first, Ezra?

233
00:18:05,354 --> 00:18:09,347
Well, first... First, we must
put our ear to the ground.

234
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:11,015
What do you mean, Cousin Ezra?

235
00:18:11,193 --> 00:18:12,820
Oh, just snooping around.

236
00:18:12,995 --> 00:18:14,223
Barbara.

237
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:17,659
- Well?
- And a good, good evening to you, miss.

238
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:21,633
- We don't wanna buy nothing.
- I represent the Empire Insurance Company.

239
00:18:21,804 --> 00:18:24,898
- I have a little policy for you.
- We've got it. Go away, I got orders.

240
00:18:25,074 --> 00:18:27,008
So have I.
I've got to see Mr. Hemingway.

241
00:18:27,176 --> 00:18:28,837
Take your foot away from the door...

242
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:31,411
...and I'll tell him you're here.
- I'm coming in...

243
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:33,012
...if you don't mind.

244
00:18:33,182 --> 00:18:36,777
I do mind. You stay right here.

245
00:18:36,952 --> 00:18:39,648
I can hardly wait till you get back.

246
00:18:48,864 --> 00:18:52,231
- I never saw such nerve.
- Laura, who was at the door?

247
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:55,427
One of them fresh insurance fellas,
ma'am. And he got in.

248
00:18:55,604 --> 00:18:57,401
What company does he represent, miss?

249
00:18:57,573 --> 00:19:00,804
- He says he's from the Empire of Buffalo.
- I'll get rid of him, Ezra.

250
00:19:00,976 --> 00:19:03,410
No, just a moment, Horace.
He represents my company.

251
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:08,607
I like persistency. Show him into
the sitting room. I'll interview him.

252
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:11,082
Laura, show him in.

253
00:19:17,526 --> 00:19:19,357
Here I am.

254
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:24,863
Mr. Ounce says for you to come
into the sitting room.

255
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:26,467
Well, what's this?

256
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:30,036
- Well, this is the sitting room.
- All right, I'll sit.

257
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:35,433
Do you realize that 65 out of every
100 people become paupers at age 50?

258
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:37,238
- No.
- It's the truth...

259
00:19:37,413 --> 00:19:39,973
...and nothing can prevent it
but life insurance.

260
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,381
And you, Mr. Hemingway,
do you realize that 65...

261
00:19:43,552 --> 00:19:45,952
...out of every 100 people
become paupers at age 50?

262
00:19:46,122 --> 00:19:48,352
- No.
- Do you?

263
00:19:48,524 --> 00:19:49,923
- Do you?
- Yes.

264
00:19:50,092 --> 00:19:53,152
The lady is right and nothing
can prevent it but life insurance.

265
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:56,787
- Haven't I seen you someplace before?
- You haven't. That's why I'm here.

266
00:19:56,966 --> 00:19:59,560
I want to give us a break.
My spies told me you'd be here.

267
00:19:59,735 --> 00:20:02,260
- You are James Higgens.
- You are Uncle Ezra.

268
00:20:02,438 --> 00:20:05,430
I've got a musical show that's a honey.
It's called <i>Sweet and Hot.</i>

269
00:20:05,608 --> 00:20:07,473
- Get out.
- I got the show, you the dough.

270
00:20:07,643 --> 00:20:08,974
- Get out.
- Now wait a minute.

271
00:20:09,145 --> 00:20:13,707
We don't know or like each other,
but this is strictly a business proposition.

272
00:20:13,883 --> 00:20:17,478
- And you stand to make at least $25,000.
- Horace, tell him to get out.

273
00:20:17,653 --> 00:20:19,712
- You get out of here.
- Now you get right out.

274
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:23,825
- If you don't make money it's a good show.
- If you mention show to me... Bulger.

275
00:20:24,493 --> 00:20:26,188
Bulger.

276
00:20:28,297 --> 00:20:29,525
Bulger.

277
00:20:29,698 --> 00:20:33,065
Bulger. Here. Put that gun away.
Put that gun away. And throw him out.

278
00:20:33,235 --> 00:20:35,635
- Wait a minute.
- Throw him out. Throw him out. Out.

279
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:41,072
D.S. Oggle-wopple. D.S. Oggle-wopple.
D.S. Oggle-wopple.

280
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,139
- What does D.S. Oggle-wopple mean?
- Maybe he's hysterical or something.

281
00:20:48,317 --> 00:20:50,012
Hysterical? He's a maniac.

282
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:54,514
- What's the matter?
- When I get excited...

283
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,987
...I get nervous indigestion.

284
00:20:56,158 --> 00:20:57,557
Come over here and sit down.

285
00:20:57,726 --> 00:21:01,423
Now you sit right down there, Ezra.
And keep quiet.

286
00:21:02,631 --> 00:21:05,623
- We'll get you a drink of water.
- No. No.

287
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:08,167
Well, go get Uncle Ezra
some bicarbonate of soda.

288
00:21:08,337 --> 00:21:10,703
- No.
- Wouldn't plain baking soda be all right?

289
00:21:10,873 --> 00:21:12,238
No.

290
00:21:12,408 --> 00:21:14,535
Well, then hold your breath
and count a hundred.

291
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,511
Have you ever tried holding your finger
to your upper lip, hard? Like this?

292
00:21:18,681 --> 00:21:20,478
There's only one remedy.

293
00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:24,016
- What is it, uncle?
- Dr. Silver's Golden Elixir.

294
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:27,485
- Made in Buffalo.
- I'll run to the drugstore and get some.

295
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:29,715
- Yeah, hurry, hurry.
- All right.

296
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:33,520
Call the drugstore, quick.

297
00:21:35,431 --> 00:21:39,595
What's the matter? Don't you know
people have hiccups for weeks sometimes?

298
00:21:40,936 --> 00:21:43,200
- Line's busy.
- Well, call another one.

299
00:21:43,372 --> 00:21:45,363
Aren't there any other drugstores
in New York?

300
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,202
Do something.

301
00:21:48,344 --> 00:21:50,710
Want me to tickle his feet?
He might start laughing.

302
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,871
I don't wanna hear
another word out of you.

303
00:21:53,816 --> 00:21:55,909
Have you got
Dr. Golden's Silver Elixir?

304
00:21:56,085 --> 00:21:59,145
Dr. Silver's Golden Elixir.

305
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:00,879
All right. He hasn't got it anyway.

306
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:04,617
Maybe if the gentleman would stick his
head upside down in a bucket of water.

307
00:22:05,961 --> 00:22:08,691
You're fired. Go pack your things.

308
00:22:08,864 --> 00:22:14,063
Very well, ma'am. And I hope the old
buzzard hiccups himself into spasms.

309
00:22:14,236 --> 00:22:17,967
Get out. Get out. Ezra. Ezra.

310
00:22:22,077 --> 00:22:24,978
That was a very dangerous
and silly thing for you to do.

311
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:29,413
He was my last chance. I've been to every
producer's office and couldn't get in.

312
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:31,644
- You got past our maid.
- I'll be an expert...

313
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,151
...at getting thrown out.

314
00:22:33,322 --> 00:22:35,586
- Say, how'd you get out?
- Oh, I was lucky.

315
00:22:35,758 --> 00:22:38,852
You gave Uncle Ezra the hiccups,
and I had to run for medicine.

316
00:22:39,028 --> 00:22:43,692
- Well, I hope they haven't got any.
- Oh, you nasty man.

317
00:22:44,366 --> 00:22:46,027
- Good evening, Barbara.
- Good evening.

318
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:48,931
Do you have Dr. Silver's Golden Elixir?

319
00:22:49,104 --> 00:22:52,631
- What?
- Dr. Silver's Golden Elixir.

320
00:22:52,808 --> 00:22:55,174
I haven't been asked for that
in 20 years.

321
00:22:55,344 --> 00:22:57,073
I may have a bottle somewhere.

322
00:22:57,246 --> 00:22:59,407
- I'll look.
- Thank you.

323
00:23:00,783 --> 00:23:03,980
You know, Mother asked me
what D.S. Oggle-wopple meant.

324
00:23:04,153 --> 00:23:06,917
Jimmy, I've heard you say that
over the phone so many times...

325
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:09,853
...I figured out that D.S. Meant:
Meet me at the drugstore.

326
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:11,890
But what does Oggle-wopple mean?

327
00:23:12,061 --> 00:23:16,225
It's a long story. That was just to make
it tough in case the folks were listening in.

328
00:23:16,398 --> 00:23:17,888
Oh, I understand.

329
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:26,237
Here's your elixir, Barbara.
It's probably the only bottle in New York.

330
00:23:26,408 --> 00:23:28,308
- Thank you. Charge it, please.
- Certainly.

331
00:23:28,477 --> 00:23:30,707
- Want a sip?
- Thanks.

332
00:23:32,581 --> 00:23:33,980
Good?

333
00:23:35,351 --> 00:23:36,682
- Well, let's go.
- All right.

334
00:23:36,852 --> 00:23:39,320
- So long, Eddy. See you later.
- So long, Jimmy.

335
00:23:39,488 --> 00:23:41,786
Oh, my elixir.

336
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:49,627
You don't have to go right back home,
do you, honey?

337
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:52,528
Gosh, it's the first night we've been
together in months.

338
00:23:53,102 --> 00:23:54,967
Look at that moon, sweets.

339
00:23:55,137 --> 00:23:57,264
I wanna talk about the show
and about us.

340
00:23:57,439 --> 00:23:59,168
I can't concentrate on it, Jimmy.

341
00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:01,571
All I can think of is Uncle Ezra's hiccups.

342
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:04,804
Now which would you rather do,
listen to Uncle Ezra's hiccups...

343
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,278
...or let me tell you
how much I love you?

344
00:24:08,317 --> 00:24:11,411
- Where you gonna tell me, Jimmy?
- I could do it here, but I won't.

345
00:24:11,587 --> 00:24:13,077
I gotta have background.

346
00:24:13,422 --> 00:24:15,151
Okay, kid, come on.

347
00:24:21,897 --> 00:24:23,592
How's this for background, sweetheart?

348
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:26,599
The sea, the moon and you.

349
00:24:28,437 --> 00:24:30,871
- It's perfect, isn't it?
- Almost.

350
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,737
- What do you mean, almost?
- Jimmy, if your play was a success...

351
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,470
...we could choose our own
background always, couldn't we?

352
00:24:37,646 --> 00:24:41,173
Success? Sweetheart, we've got
a million dollars right here...

353
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,079
...if I can get someone to back me.

354
00:24:43,252 --> 00:24:45,277
Just listen to this.

355
00:24:46,155 --> 00:24:48,419
This is how I feel about you.

356
00:24:49,391 --> 00:24:52,986
<i>My love must be a kind of blind love</i>

357
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:59,123
<i>I can't see anyone but you</i>

358
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:05,705
<i>And, dear, I wonder if you find love</i>

359
00:25:05,874 --> 00:25:11,506
<i>An optical illusion too</i>

360
00:25:11,947 --> 00:25:15,644
<i>Are the stars out tonight?</i>

361
00:25:16,085 --> 00:25:19,350
<i>I don't know if it's cloudy or bright</i>

362
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:22,388
<i>'Cause I only have eyes</i>

363
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,858
<i>For you, dear</i>

364
00:25:27,129 --> 00:25:29,757
<i>The moon may be high</i>

365
00:25:29,932 --> 00:25:33,095
<i>But I can't see a thing in the sky</i>

366
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:36,604
<i>'Cause I only have eyes</i>

367
00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:40,472
<i>For you</i>

368
00:25:40,642 --> 00:25:45,978
<i>I don't know if we're in a garden</i>

369
00:25:46,682 --> 00:25:50,448
<i>Or on a crowded avenue</i>

370
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:56,114
<i>You are here, so am I

371
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:59,590
<i>Maybe millions of people go by</i>

372
00:25:59,761 --> 00:26:06,189
<i>But they all disappear from view</i>

373
00:26:06,368 --> 00:26:11,806
<i>And I only have eyes</i>

374
00:26:11,974 --> 00:26:17,606
<i>For you</i>

375
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,878
Gee, Jimmy, that's swell.

376
00:26:25,053 --> 00:26:26,384
So are you.

377
00:26:33,896 --> 00:26:35,591
My.

378
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:50,000
For heaven's sakes.

379
00:26:53,982 --> 00:26:57,349
Ezra, please let me send for a doctor.

380
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:59,919
Don't wanna. I hate doctors.

381
00:27:00,088 --> 00:27:05,253
Don't know what's keeping Barbara.
Well, are you comfortable?

382
00:27:05,427 --> 00:27:07,224
Is there anything I can do?

383
00:27:07,396 --> 00:27:10,388
Yes. Get me some elixir and get out.

384
00:27:10,566 --> 00:27:13,091
Never had a woman
in my bedroom before in my life.

385
00:27:13,268 --> 00:27:15,099
- But, Ezra...
- Get out.

386
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,364
- But I...
- Go on, get out.

387
00:27:22,211 --> 00:27:23,473
Crown Drug?

388
00:27:23,645 --> 00:27:27,411
I'll give you $ 100
for a bottle of Dr. Silver's Golden Elixir.

389
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:30,074
And I'll give you 1000 bucks
if I ever heard of it.

390
00:27:31,853 --> 00:27:33,218
Do something.

391
00:27:33,388 --> 00:27:36,789
I've called up 500 drugstores,
and you ask me to do something.

392
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:38,256
Call one other one, quick.

393
00:27:40,462 --> 00:27:41,929
My.

394
00:27:43,332 --> 00:27:45,562
Hello? Star Drug?

395
00:27:45,734 --> 00:27:49,727
I'll give you 500 bottles...
$500 for a bottle of Dr. Silver's...

396
00:27:49,905 --> 00:27:53,363
- Dr. Golden, Dr. Silver's Gold...
- Dr. Silver's Golden Elixir.

397
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:55,100
Dr. Silver's Golden Elixir.

398
00:27:55,277 --> 00:27:57,745
I haven't seen a bottle
since the Spanish-American War.

399
00:27:58,247 --> 00:28:01,080
Oh, get another number, quick.

400
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:04,981
Ezra.

401
00:28:05,153 --> 00:28:07,781
There's not a drugstore
in New York that carries it.

402
00:28:07,956 --> 00:28:09,685
Serves me right for coming without it.

403
00:28:09,858 --> 00:28:13,919
Imagine no druggist in New York City
carrying Dr. Silver's Elixir.

404
00:28:14,096 --> 00:28:17,156
Send to Buffalo.
Get a couple of cases. Don't stand there.

405
00:28:17,332 --> 00:28:19,425
- But I...
- Do something. Get out.

406
00:28:19,635 --> 00:28:22,126
Go on. Get out. Get it. Get the elixir.

407
00:28:22,304 --> 00:28:25,865
How do I know where you get it?
What kind of a drugstore is this?

408
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:27,599
That's your business.

409
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,266
Oh, Horace, control yourself.

410
00:28:29,444 --> 00:28:31,435
- I've called up every...
- Horace.

411
00:28:31,613 --> 00:28:34,548
- Blankety-blank drugstore in this town.
- Control your language.

412
00:28:34,716 --> 00:28:36,411
- Ezra might hear you.
- I don't give a...

413
00:28:36,585 --> 00:28:37,813
Horace.

414
00:28:40,622 --> 00:28:42,487
Barbara.

415
00:28:47,162 --> 00:28:48,527
Where have you been?

416
00:28:48,697 --> 00:28:51,131
- Staten Island.
- What for?

417
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,536
- Oh, for Dr. Silver's Golden Elixir.
- She's got it.

418
00:28:55,704 --> 00:28:58,639
- Give it to me, Horace.
- Hurry up. Give it to him. Cousin Ezra.

419
00:28:59,207 --> 00:29:02,142
- Come on, hurry up. Give it to him.
- Cousin Ezra, here it is.

420
00:29:02,344 --> 00:29:04,403
That's it. The only thing that never fails.

421
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:07,980
- How many spoonfuls?
- Never mind. I'll drink it out of the bottle.

422
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,243
Goodbye, hiccups.

423
00:29:21,096 --> 00:29:24,657
That stuff is magic.
I feel like a new man.

424
00:29:36,387 --> 00:29:37,945
- Honey.
- Jimmy.

425
00:29:39,891 --> 00:29:42,451
I got a date with a producer.
They're playing the songs.

426
00:29:42,627 --> 00:29:44,356
- I need you for good luck.
- Okay.

427
00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:45,826
Fine.

428
00:30:01,613 --> 00:30:03,706
Boys, that's just what the theater needs.

429
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:06,475
It's fresh. It's young. It's good.

430
00:30:06,651 --> 00:30:09,085
I like the songs. I like the book.

431
00:30:09,253 --> 00:30:11,016
The whole thing is colossal.

432
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:14,823
- You'll accept it?
- For immediate production.

433
00:30:14,993 --> 00:30:19,589
I'm going to give you my check
for $5000, advance royalties.

434
00:30:19,764 --> 00:30:21,664
Five thousand dollars?
Did you hear that?

435
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:25,894
- Oh, gee, that's swell.
- We're in. We're in. We're on the way.

436
00:30:26,371 --> 00:30:28,430
There's your check, my boy.

437
00:30:28,606 --> 00:30:30,597
Now if you will just
put your name to this...

438
00:30:30,775 --> 00:30:32,868
...merely a release
of the property to me...

439
00:30:33,044 --> 00:30:37,845
...while we're waiting for the contracts.
Now, I'll notify you when rehearsals start.

440
00:30:38,016 --> 00:30:39,950
Will we get the regular percentage?

441
00:30:40,118 --> 00:30:43,645
You don't have to be satisfied
with any usual royalties.

442
00:30:43,821 --> 00:30:47,814
I'll guarantee you boys a straight
15 percent of the gross.

443
00:30:47,992 --> 00:30:49,983
Mr. Todd, you don't know
how grateful we are.

444
00:30:50,161 --> 00:30:55,155
Indeed. The only other playwright getting
15 percent is George Bernard Shaw.

445
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:58,734
Mr. Todd,
you're the swellest guy in the world.

446
00:30:58,903 --> 00:31:01,770
My boy, you're youth.
Your play is youth.

447
00:31:01,939 --> 00:31:04,305
And I always believe
in encouraging youth.

448
00:31:05,777 --> 00:31:09,372
In fact I may almost say
that I was young once myself.

449
00:31:09,547 --> 00:31:13,039
Well, you go right ahead and say it.
Nobody's stopping you.

450
00:31:17,488 --> 00:31:20,753
Well, well, Mabel.
My, you're looking splendid.

451
00:31:20,925 --> 00:31:23,758
I ought to. I spent
my last 200 bucks on this outfit.

452
00:31:23,928 --> 00:31:26,522
- Know what I came back to New York in?
- In good health.

453
00:31:26,698 --> 00:31:30,190
- In a coat and a pair of step-ins.
- Did you have to walk back?

454
00:31:30,368 --> 00:31:32,427
It wasn't your fault that I didn't,
you bandit.

455
00:31:32,603 --> 00:31:34,833
Well, Mr. Higgens,
I'll call you up later...

456
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:39,067
...since this is a personal matter.
- Personal my eye, I want witnesses.

457
00:31:39,577 --> 00:31:42,205
One o'clock. I have a luncheon
engagement with my banker.

458
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,213
- Now, you'Il...
- Fork over that $57 back salary or I'Il...

459
00:31:45,383 --> 00:31:46,907
You'll have to see my lawyer.

460
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:50,452
Your lawyer. You four-flushing chiseler.

461
00:31:50,655 --> 00:31:53,556
He sends me out in a turkey show
that folds up like an accordion.

462
00:31:53,725 --> 00:31:56,592
He leaves me holding the bag,
stranded, broke in Troy.

463
00:31:57,128 --> 00:31:59,153
Have you ever been stranded in Troy?

464
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,820
Have you ever even been there?

465
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:03,361
- No, no.
- No.

466
00:32:10,808 --> 00:32:13,140
Well, buddy, what did that
look like to you?

467
00:32:13,311 --> 00:32:15,506
It looks like you can't get
blood out of a turnip.

468
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,080
- Did he hook you too?
- No, he just...

469
00:32:18,249 --> 00:32:20,444
...gave us a check
for $5000 for our show.

470
00:32:20,618 --> 00:32:24,213
Five thousand?
Pardon me while I have a convulsion.

471
00:32:25,323 --> 00:32:28,690
Well, I'd like to meet my fellow
sufferers. I'm Mabel Anderson.

472
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,124
This is Miss Hemingway.

473
00:32:31,562 --> 00:32:33,587
And this is Johnny Harris.

474
00:32:33,865 --> 00:32:36,629
And this is Buttercup Balmer.
And I'm Jimmy Higgens.

475
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:38,268
- Hello, Jimmy.
- Hello.

476
00:32:38,436 --> 00:32:40,734
You're not related
to Horace P. Hemingway?

477
00:32:40,905 --> 00:32:43,635
- He's my father.
- The sausage casing Hemingways?

478
00:32:43,808 --> 00:32:46,038
- Yes, why?
- Oh, nothing.

479
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:49,407
Nothing. I just seemed to see
a meal ticket coming over the horizon.

480
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,480
Jimmy, please. Let's get out of here.

481
00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:53,344
No, wait a minute.
I'm getting an idea.

482
00:32:53,518 --> 00:32:56,043
Yes, I've got it.
You say you've got a show?

483
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,744
Have you got $20,000 to put it on?

484
00:32:57,922 --> 00:33:01,653
I've got 17 cents and the clothes I stand in.
But there's life in the old girl yet.

485
00:33:01,826 --> 00:33:04,454
Let's you and me go into a conference.
Beat it, Buttercup.

486
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:08,292
Come on, Johnny.
Miss Hemingway, if you please.

487
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,528
Goodbye now.

488
00:33:12,203 --> 00:33:13,761
She's got a nerve.

489
00:33:14,672 --> 00:33:16,697
My friend, what kind
of a show have you got?

490
00:33:16,874 --> 00:33:19,775
It's a great musical show,
got the swellest songs you ever heard.

491
00:33:19,944 --> 00:33:21,639
Is that a fact? Well, let me hear one.

492
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:24,145
I got one here I think you'll like.
It's called:

493
00:33:24,315 --> 00:33:26,112
"Try To See it My Way."
Here we go.

494
00:33:30,588 --> 00:33:34,285
<i>Girl of my heart</i>
<i>Why should we start</i>

495
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:37,188
<i>Quarreling you and I?</i>

496
00:33:37,728 --> 00:33:40,754
<i>That's a very bad beginning</i>

497
00:33:40,932 --> 00:33:44,299
<i>Ending with goodbye</i>

498
00:33:44,468 --> 00:33:49,269
<i>You're a bit wild</i>
<i>Simply a child</i>

499
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,637
<i>Wanting your own sweet way</i>

500
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:56,179
<i>So before you leave me</i>

501
00:33:56,347 --> 00:33:57,814
<i>Count up to 10</i>

502
00:33:57,982 --> 00:34:00,075
<i>While I say</i>

503
00:34:00,985 --> 00:34:04,785
<i>Try to see it my way, baby</i>

504
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:08,119
<i>Don't break up a beautiful affair</i>

505
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:13,957
- What are you smiling at?
- Isn't that a sweet song I wrote?

506
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:16,860
Why is he singing my song to her?

507
00:34:17,034 --> 00:34:18,899
I guess that's the way a crooner works.

508
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,628
- <i>tried to see it your way</i>

509
00:34:20,805 --> 00:34:23,740
<i>Tried to understand your point of view</i>

510
00:34:24,575 --> 00:34:28,170
<i>But I don't want to see it your way</i>

511
00:34:28,346 --> 00:34:31,713
<i>'Cause your way means we're through</i>

512
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:36,353
<i>Let's both sit down and talk a while</i>

513
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,580
<i>That's all that I suggest</i>

514
00:34:39,924 --> 00:34:43,758
<i>A word of love, a tender smile</i>

515
00:34:43,928 --> 00:34:47,022
<i>And a kiss or two will do the rest</i>

516
00:34:48,266 --> 00:34:52,134
<i>Your way is the last goodbye way</i>

517
00:34:52,303 --> 00:34:56,069
<i>My way is the end of every tear</i>

518
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,006
<i>Won't you try to see it my way?</i>

519
00:35:00,177 --> 00:35:04,978
<i>Try to see it my way, dear</i>

520
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:14,014
- Well, what are they doing now?
- Maybe they're planning a double suicide.

521
00:35:14,992 --> 00:35:17,426
- That's swell.
- Wait till you hear the rest of them.

522
00:35:17,595 --> 00:35:19,028
There's a great part for you.

523
00:35:19,196 --> 00:35:22,188
- Help me put the show on.
- All right. The show's on and I'm in.

524
00:35:22,366 --> 00:35:26,097
All you've got to do is get me a private
interview with Horace P. Hemingway.

525
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,397
- Is that all you need?
- I'll get enough money...

526
00:35:28,572 --> 00:35:30,563
...to finance <i>Ben-Hur</i>
with solid-gold horses.

527
00:35:30,741 --> 00:35:33,676
- Let's shake on it.
- I'll raise you one. We'll kiss on it.

528
00:35:37,081 --> 00:35:39,072
Barbara. The show's in. Mabel's done it.

529
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,547
I don't care what she's done.

530
00:35:40,718 --> 00:35:43,243
And I don't care what happens
to your show or to you.

531
00:35:43,421 --> 00:35:45,082
Oh, Barbara, Barbara...

532
00:35:45,256 --> 00:35:46,587
Business before pleasure.

533
00:35:46,757 --> 00:35:48,349
Wait, let's see if I've got it.

534
00:35:51,362 --> 00:35:54,923
Yep, there it is. There's the backer
of our show, and there's the billet-doux.

535
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:59,263
Look out, Uncle Tom Hemingway, here
comes Mabel Legree a-cracking her whip.

536
00:36:16,787 --> 00:36:21,019
Thus, my friends, we form tonight
the kernel of the nut which is to be.

537
00:36:21,258 --> 00:36:25,217
That nut is the Ounce Foundation
for the E. Of the A.M.

538
00:36:30,801 --> 00:36:32,496
Oh, thank... Thank you.

539
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,433
Thank you.

540
00:36:38,743 --> 00:36:41,109
Those magic letters
signify so much to all of us.

541
00:36:41,278 --> 00:36:44,304
What does it mean? My friends,
the elevation of American morals.

542
00:36:44,482 --> 00:36:46,507
That's what it means.

543
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:51,911
The nut I refer to is going to be
a hard nut to crack.

544
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:58,927
We all know what a task lies before us.
You know what a task lies before you.

545
00:36:59,096 --> 00:37:02,259
You know, you know and you know.

546
00:37:06,003 --> 00:37:09,939
And if the O.F. For the E. Of the A.M.
Shall prevail, and it must prevail...

547
00:37:11,842 --> 00:37:14,675
...every theater in our
wicked city shall be closed.

548
00:37:18,582 --> 00:37:20,846
Mr. Horace P. Hemingway,
our vice president...

549
00:37:21,018 --> 00:37:22,383
...will conclude the meeting.

550
00:37:22,553 --> 00:37:25,522
Mr. Horace P. Hemingway.

551
00:37:25,689 --> 00:37:30,251
All right, folks, our honored president
has declared war on the wicked.

552
00:37:32,563 --> 00:37:35,657
Now if you'll just pick up the little
slips of paper which you have...

553
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:38,859
...we shall all join in the battle cry.

554
00:37:39,036 --> 00:37:40,401
Rise, please.

555
00:37:41,205 --> 00:37:43,264
Now, all together.

556
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:48,003
"The Ounce Foundation
for the Elevation of American Morals.

557
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:49,544
Who are we?

558
00:37:49,713 --> 00:37:52,648
The Ounce Foundation
for the Elevation of American Morals.

559
00:37:52,817 --> 00:37:56,412
Rah-rah-rah.
Ziss-boom bah.

560
00:37:56,587 --> 00:37:59,613
The O.F. For the E. Of the A.M."

561
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:05,228
The meeting is dismissed.
Thank you. Thank you.

562
00:38:05,396 --> 00:38:08,593
- I'm so glad you could come.
- Goodbye.

563
00:38:10,835 --> 00:38:13,463
- Wonderful.
- The Ounce Foundation.

564
00:38:19,176 --> 00:38:22,407
We are fathering... I mean, mothering
a great movement. Yes, indeed.

565
00:38:23,614 --> 00:38:24,979
Good night. Thank you.

566
00:38:25,149 --> 00:38:29,017
Don't forget the Ounce Foundation
for the Elevation of American Morals.

567
00:38:30,821 --> 00:38:32,152
The Ounce Foundation...

568
00:38:36,093 --> 00:38:39,221
- Is Jimmy there?
- No, he's out. Say, listen, Barbara.

569
00:38:39,396 --> 00:38:41,523
We're writing in a little
dance tune for you.

570
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:45,191
- But where's Jimmy?
- Out with Mabel, digging up our financing.

571
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:47,599
Don't write any dance tune for me.

572
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:51,832
Write them for his Mabel.
I don't ever wanna see him again.

573
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,471
- Was I all right with the battle cry?
- Yes, yes.

574
00:38:55,646 --> 00:38:58,274
- Thank you, Cousin Ezra.
- I was proud of you, Horace.

575
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:01,941
- Yes, it was a remarkable fine meeting.
- Oh, I was thrilled to the core.

576
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:05,384
- Me too.
- Let me see. Oh, it's 10:00.

577
00:39:05,556 --> 00:39:07,217
Way past our bedtime.

578
00:39:07,391 --> 00:39:10,383
Good night. Sleep well
so your loins may be girded for the battle.

579
00:39:10,561 --> 00:39:13,223
- Same to you, Cousin Ezra. Same to you.
- Thank you.

580
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,694
- Good night, Horace.
- Good night, dear.

581
00:40:12,356 --> 00:40:15,792
"Please don't mention
this unfortunate night to a soul.

582
00:40:16,026 --> 00:40:19,018
Horace P. Hemingway."

583
00:40:20,764 --> 00:40:23,528
You dreadful woman.
How did you get in my room?

584
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:25,225
Hello, Horace.

585
00:40:25,402 --> 00:40:27,870
- You can't smoke in here.
- I am smoking.

586
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:33,475
Do I smell cigarette smoke?

587
00:40:33,644 --> 00:40:36,010
Not in this house, Ezra.

588
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,807
Must be someone burning garbage.

589
00:40:38,983 --> 00:40:40,382
Well, good night, Mathilda.

590
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:42,416
Good night, Ezra.

591
00:40:46,523 --> 00:40:48,753
How did you get in here?
What did you want?

592
00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:51,952
- Twenty thousand dollars.
- T... Twenty what?

593
00:40:52,129 --> 00:40:53,960
Twenty thousand of these.

594
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:55,723
Twenty thousand dollars.

595
00:40:55,899 --> 00:40:57,560
- Go away.
- Look, honey.

596
00:40:57,735 --> 00:41:00,135
We've played this scene before,
we know how it goes.

597
00:41:00,304 --> 00:41:01,794
Now please don't waste any time.

598
00:41:01,972 --> 00:41:03,667
Give.

599
00:41:06,844 --> 00:41:09,438
Every time I come into this room
I'm afraid of finding you.

600
00:41:09,613 --> 00:41:11,103
I dream about it at night.

601
00:41:11,282 --> 00:41:12,943
I wake up in a cold sweat.

602
00:41:13,117 --> 00:41:15,745
Are you gonna quit stalling
or am I gonna start screaming?

603
00:41:15,919 --> 00:41:19,218
- You wouldn't dare.
- Cousin Ezra...

604
00:41:28,232 --> 00:41:31,998
- What was that?
- Sounds like it came from down here.

605
00:41:38,575 --> 00:41:40,099
Horace?

606
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,647
Yes, Ezra?

607
00:41:44,882 --> 00:41:46,372
Did you hear something just now?

608
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:48,416
No.

609
00:41:49,053 --> 00:41:51,578
That was just the plumbing.

610
00:41:51,755 --> 00:41:53,382
You mean that little:

611
00:41:53,557 --> 00:41:56,890
"Ezra"?

612
00:41:57,194 --> 00:41:58,889
Was that the plumbing?

613
00:41:59,063 --> 00:42:03,659
Y... Yes, Mathilda.
Just a little wind in the pipes.

614
00:42:03,967 --> 00:42:06,993
I've heard many a wind in many a pipe,
but never a sound like that.

615
00:42:07,171 --> 00:42:09,230
Well, now, Ezra,
you'd better go back to bed.

616
00:42:09,406 --> 00:42:12,807
Well, there's something amiss here.
I can feel it in my bones.

617
00:42:16,413 --> 00:42:19,109
- Good night, Ezra.
- Good night, Mathilda.

618
00:42:24,254 --> 00:42:27,712
- If you ever scream like that again...
- I'll never scream like that again.

619
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:31,622
Next time you'll hear me a mile away.
It won't sound like no wind in the pipes.

620
00:42:31,795 --> 00:42:33,729
- What will you do?
- What'll you do, Horace?

621
00:42:33,897 --> 00:42:35,296
Don't call me by my first name.

622
00:42:35,466 --> 00:42:38,299
- Okay, P. P's your second name, isn't it?
- P stands for Peter.

623
00:42:38,469 --> 00:42:40,266
All right, Pete, how about the 20 grand?

624
00:42:40,437 --> 00:42:41,927
I feel another scream coming on.

625
00:42:42,106 --> 00:42:45,303
You'd rather give me $20,000 than
lose Ezra's 10 million, wouldn't you?

626
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:47,341
- How'd you know about that?
- A little bird.

627
00:42:47,611 --> 00:42:48,976
W... Where you going?

628
00:42:49,146 --> 00:42:52,604
- To tell Cousin Ezra what a Romeo you are.
- Oh, no.

629
00:42:53,283 --> 00:42:56,081
I'll tell him about our night.
That we were train roommates.

630
00:42:56,253 --> 00:42:58,244
- I'll show him your card.
- How much?

631
00:42:58,422 --> 00:43:00,356
- Twenty-five thousand.
- You said 20 before.

632
00:43:00,524 --> 00:43:03,118
- Why didn't you pay me before?
- That's every cent I've got.

633
00:43:03,293 --> 00:43:06,160
- I'd cry, but I haven't a handkerchief.
- If I give it to you...

634
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,264
...will you give me the card,
let me alone?

635
00:43:08,432 --> 00:43:10,263
- Need you ask?
- All right.

636
00:43:18,675 --> 00:43:20,302
Plumbing, huh?

637
00:43:20,477 --> 00:43:22,809
Wind in the pipe, huh?

638
00:43:25,315 --> 00:43:26,612
- There.
- Twenty-five thousand.

639
00:43:26,784 --> 00:43:28,547
All that fuss over a mere trifle.

640
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:31,085
You take my last penny
and call it a trifle.

641
00:43:32,456 --> 00:43:35,254
- W... Who is it?
- It's Mathilda.

642
00:43:35,993 --> 00:43:38,257
My wife. Come on, get out here.

643
00:43:38,429 --> 00:43:40,624
- No, I won't get out...
- Here. No, I...

644
00:43:40,798 --> 00:43:42,595
If she catches you in here, I'm ruined.

645
00:43:42,766 --> 00:43:45,496
Come on, get in this closet.

646
00:43:53,577 --> 00:43:57,377
Why... Why, Mathilda. It's you.

647
00:43:58,215 --> 00:44:01,082
I'm your wife, Mathilda. Remember?

648
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:04,584
I... I was nervous.
I couldn't sleep.

649
00:44:04,755 --> 00:44:08,122
- So you've been to bed?
- Oh, yes, yes, you see? That's... That's it.

650
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:11,784
Since when do you go to bed
with your pants on?

651
00:44:11,962 --> 00:44:16,126
Well, you see I...
Suddenly I had a heart attack.

652
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,029
Yes.

653
00:44:18,202 --> 00:44:21,831
- You know.
- If I don't, I'll find out.

654
00:44:24,141 --> 00:44:25,506
That's the bathroom.

655
00:44:26,143 --> 00:44:29,442
What do you suppose I thought it was?
The Bank of England?

656
00:44:31,014 --> 00:44:34,142
- W... Where you going now?
- You'll find out.

657
00:44:41,959 --> 00:44:45,258
- Goodbye, fatty.
- Conspiracy. Conspiracy.

658
00:44:50,367 --> 00:44:53,029
Well, only a few weeks more
and the $ 10 million is yours.

659
00:44:53,203 --> 00:44:55,330
Providing you don't make me
change my mind.

660
00:44:55,506 --> 00:44:57,337
Thank you, Ezra. Thank you very much.

661
00:44:57,508 --> 00:44:59,499
You don't know
how generous you are, Ezra.

662
00:44:59,676 --> 00:45:01,337
Now how about a bite of lunch?

663
00:45:01,512 --> 00:45:03,036
Well, I do feel a bit peckish.

664
00:45:03,213 --> 00:45:06,341
Oh, I know a real nice place
where we can get a healthful meal.

665
00:45:06,517 --> 00:45:08,985
- Well, let's go there.
- Oh, yes.

666
00:45:14,091 --> 00:45:16,082
Just a minute. Just a minute.

667
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,990
I found the first object for our
foundation to crush.

668
00:45:19,162 --> 00:45:22,427
James Higgens is rehearsing a play on
Broadway entitled <i>Sweet and Hot.</i>

669
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:25,625
Just read that disgraceful item,
Horace. Read that.

670
00:45:26,236 --> 00:45:28,704
<i>"Sweet and Hot,</i> Jimmy Higgens'
torrid musical comedy...

671
00:45:28,872 --> 00:45:30,897
...springs from the fountain of youth.

672
00:45:31,074 --> 00:45:34,066
Author, songwriters and actors
are all youngsters."

673
00:45:35,212 --> 00:45:37,407
- Go on, go on.
- "Jimmy's backer is said to be...

674
00:45:37,581 --> 00:45:39,981
...none other than a big businessman...

675
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:45,520
...who is very much interested
in the career of Mabel Anderson."

676
00:45:46,056 --> 00:45:50,015
Well, it was horrible enough for Jimmy
to write such a terrible play...

677
00:45:50,193 --> 00:45:52,593
...but any man who would
finance such an outrage...

678
00:45:52,763 --> 00:45:54,458
...should be tarred and feathered.

679
00:45:54,631 --> 00:45:56,963
The Ounce Foundation
shall run him out of town.

680
00:45:57,134 --> 00:46:00,035
I myself shall give him
a scathing rebuke.

681
00:46:00,203 --> 00:46:02,364
We'll attend the opening
of this production.

682
00:46:02,539 --> 00:46:04,939
- And denounce it to the world.
- Will you excuse me?

683
00:46:05,108 --> 00:46:09,135
A conference with a lot of big, sausage
casing men from Australia. See you tonight.

684
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,276
Not a word about our attitude
toward <i>Sweet and Hot.</i>

685
00:46:12,449 --> 00:46:13,973
We must swoop down on them.

686
00:46:14,151 --> 00:46:17,643
Oh, yes, Ezra, swoop down on them
like an eagle from the sky.

687
00:46:17,921 --> 00:46:20,253
- Well, goodbye, Ezra.
- Goodbye, Horace.

688
00:46:20,424 --> 00:46:22,619
- Goodbye, Mathilda.
- Goodbye, Horace.

689
00:46:22,793 --> 00:46:26,092
You know Horace's heart and soul
is with the Ounce Foundation.

690
00:46:26,263 --> 00:46:27,525
I know.

691
00:47:06,036 --> 00:47:08,266
Say, that kid can dance.

692
00:47:19,449 --> 00:47:22,441
Say, you'll do, kid. Go up
and get measured for costumes.

693
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:24,780
Oh, gee, thanks.

694
00:47:25,255 --> 00:47:27,621
All right, girls, take it easy.

695
00:47:29,926 --> 00:47:32,793
Say, that kid's got plenty of stuff.
Who is she?

696
00:47:32,963 --> 00:47:34,453
I don't know. What name she give?

697
00:47:34,631 --> 00:47:37,794
Joan Grey. Never heard of her.
She'll do till a better one comes along.

698
00:47:37,968 --> 00:47:39,401
Okay.

699
00:47:39,569 --> 00:47:43,198
All right, kids. Come on, places now.
Let's get set. Let's get started.

700
00:47:43,373 --> 00:47:45,534
All right, Buttercup, hit it.

701
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:54,077
Hiya, pop.

702
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:56,048
Go away, go away.

703
00:48:18,508 --> 00:48:21,443
Burn my clothes, if it isn't Romeo,
our financial backer.

704
00:48:23,146 --> 00:48:25,239
I wonder what's on his mind. Come on.

705
00:48:32,656 --> 00:48:34,920
- Well, well, Uncle Horace.
- Hello, Hemie.

706
00:48:35,092 --> 00:48:37,993
James, a word with you.

707
00:48:42,466 --> 00:48:45,367
- See here, young man...
- Congratulations, Horace, congratulations.

708
00:48:45,535 --> 00:48:48,470
- On what?
- Defying Uncle Ezra and seeing our show.

709
00:48:48,638 --> 00:48:51,630
I'm not defying Ezra.
And this show has got to stop right now.

710
00:48:51,808 --> 00:48:54,504
Got to stop? Fat chance,
Uncle Horace, fat chance.

711
00:48:54,678 --> 00:48:56,976
You young scoundrel. It's my money.

712
00:48:57,147 --> 00:48:59,411
It was your money.
You're a credit to this country.

713
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:02,143
- You put a lot of people to work.
- Not this kind of work.

714
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:05,686
- If this gets out, I'm ruined.
- You'll take bows when the show opens.

715
00:49:05,856 --> 00:49:08,723
This show is not going to open.

716
00:49:14,397 --> 00:49:17,889
Stop it. Everybody, stop it.
This show is off, understand?

717
00:49:18,068 --> 00:49:21,435
- You're all dismissed.
- Girls, girls. Don't pay any attention to him.

718
00:49:21,605 --> 00:49:23,300
This show must not go on.

719
00:49:23,473 --> 00:49:28,035
He's only our backer and we've already
got the money. Feed him to the lions.

720
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:47,622
Help. Help.
Let me go, let me go, let me go.

721
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:52,692
Back to rehearsal. Let's go, everybody.
Come on. Snap into it.

722
00:49:59,643 --> 00:50:02,441
I'll call the police.
I'll have you arrested for assault.

723
00:50:02,612 --> 00:50:05,172
Go ahead, Uncle Horace.
We'd be glad to get the publicity.

724
00:50:05,348 --> 00:50:07,316
- Publicity?
- Sure. "Horace P. Hemingway...

725
00:50:07,484 --> 00:50:08,781
...big sausage man in town...

726
00:50:08,952 --> 00:50:11,546
...gives chorus girl $25,000
to put on show...

727
00:50:11,721 --> 00:50:14,383
...puts a lot of people out of work"...
- No, no, no.

728
00:50:14,558 --> 00:50:16,685
Please don't do anything like that.

729
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,259
Go ahead and rehearse.

730
00:50:18,428 --> 00:50:20,896
But promise me that Ezra
won't find out about me.

731
00:50:21,064 --> 00:50:22,964
Now, don't you worry, because...

732
00:50:23,133 --> 00:50:27,934
All right, girls. Come on, come on. Get
into it. Hit the deck. Let's see it.

733
00:50:28,171 --> 00:50:29,832
- Barbara.
- Hit it, Buttercup.

734
00:50:32,409 --> 00:50:35,003
- Barbara.
- My name is Joan Grey.

735
00:50:35,178 --> 00:50:36,406
You go put on some clothes.

736
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,980
- I have them on.
- Why, that's disgraceful.

737
00:50:39,149 --> 00:50:41,515
Barbara's just a visitor.
She's not in the show.

738
00:50:41,685 --> 00:50:43,209
Oh, is that so?

739
00:50:43,386 --> 00:50:46,480
You asked me to come to rehearsal,
and your dance director hired me.

740
00:50:46,656 --> 00:50:48,647
I got in the show,
and I'm going to stay in.

741
00:50:48,825 --> 00:50:51,453
Now, now, now, honey,
maybe your father's right.

742
00:50:51,628 --> 00:50:53,459
You don't want me around, is that it?

743
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:56,758
Afraid I'll cramp your style
with your darling Mabel?

744
00:50:56,933 --> 00:50:59,231
I've heard enough of this.
You get some clothes on.

745
00:50:59,469 --> 00:51:01,096
I don't care what either of you say.

746
00:51:01,271 --> 00:51:03,034
I'm free, white and 21.

747
00:51:03,206 --> 00:51:05,265
I love to dance and I'm going to dance.

748
00:51:05,442 --> 00:51:09,435
And if you fire me from this show,
I'll get a job in another one.

749
00:51:12,782 --> 00:51:16,479
Wait till Ezra and Mathilda hear
about this. I'm ruined. Sunk. Lost.

750
00:51:16,653 --> 00:51:18,985
Listen, you don't really
think we'd let Barbara...

751
00:51:19,155 --> 00:51:20,622
...appear in a professional show?

752
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:22,257
Why, she can't. She's an amateur.

753
00:51:22,425 --> 00:51:24,188
Helen Wills is an amateur in tennis.

754
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:27,353
- She can't play pro tennis, can she?
- I don't know, can she?

755
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:29,589
Why, of course she can't.
Now, don't you worry.

756
00:51:29,766 --> 00:51:32,200
I can handle Barbara.
Besides, the show's a bit long...

757
00:51:32,369 --> 00:51:35,099
...and we're gonna cut out
all the numbers that Barbara's in.

758
00:51:35,272 --> 00:51:38,901
If Ezra ever finds out
anything about anything...

759
00:51:39,075 --> 00:51:42,238
...he'll cut me off
like a ripe banana. He said so.

760
00:51:42,412 --> 00:51:44,209
How's he ever gonna hear of it?

761
00:51:44,381 --> 00:51:46,042
He always has his ear
to the ground.

762
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:49,381
Lot of newspapermen to see you
about the show, Mr. Higgens.

763
00:51:49,552 --> 00:51:51,747
- This is the end.
- Now you go hide someplace...

764
00:51:51,922 --> 00:51:53,480
...I'll take care of everything.

765
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:57,787
- Hi, Jimmy.
- Hello, Jimmy.

766
00:51:57,961 --> 00:52:00,156
- Hi, boys.
- Who's this secret backer of yours?

767
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:01,661
Can't tell you just now, boys.

768
00:52:01,831 --> 00:52:04,197
I get it. The more mysterious,
the more publicity.

769
00:52:04,367 --> 00:52:05,925
You've got the right idea.

770
00:52:09,639 --> 00:52:12,267
This is the one. Put it in the alley.

771
00:53:00,623 --> 00:53:03,091
Here they come. Finally.

772
00:53:14,571 --> 00:53:16,732
- Have you seen Barbara yet?
- Hasn't she shown up?

773
00:53:16,906 --> 00:53:18,874
- Hasn't she even called?
- Not a peep.

774
00:53:19,042 --> 00:53:20,509
I told you about amateurs.

775
00:53:20,677 --> 00:53:23,373
She probably forgot it's the opening
and made another date.

776
00:53:23,546 --> 00:53:25,446
- You know the opening number?
- Backwards.

777
00:53:25,615 --> 00:53:28,675
Put on Barbara's costume.
If I drop dead from all this, play my part.

778
00:53:28,852 --> 00:53:30,149
Come on, Mabel, we're late.

779
00:53:32,956 --> 00:53:35,254
Hurry up, will you, Mabel?
Go ahead, hurry.

780
00:53:36,993 --> 00:53:40,053
Hold that curtain. We can't start.
The leading lady hasn't shown up.

781
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:41,697
Okay, boss.

782
00:53:43,266 --> 00:53:46,429
My, I'm so glad Barbara
didn't tease to go.

783
00:53:46,603 --> 00:53:48,468
I'd never permit it.
She's much too young.

784
00:53:48,638 --> 00:53:50,606
- Yes, yes, indeedy.
- Yes.

785
00:53:50,774 --> 00:53:53,038
Bulger? Are your loins
girded for the battle?

786
00:53:53,209 --> 00:53:55,803
The loins is ready to roar.

787
00:54:01,418 --> 00:54:03,750
Are these gentlemen
capable and fearless?

788
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,184
Sure, they's the cream of the crop.

789
00:54:06,356 --> 00:54:08,119
They understand my signal for action?

790
00:54:08,291 --> 00:54:11,158
Sure, when you takes out
your handkerchief and waves it...

791
00:54:11,327 --> 00:54:12,851
...they gives it the works.

792
00:54:13,029 --> 00:54:14,257
- Right.
- Right.

793
00:54:14,431 --> 00:54:16,422
Mathilda, Horace, forward.

794
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:19,295
Ezra, don't you think
you're going a trifle too far?

795
00:54:19,469 --> 00:54:23,735
No, evil must be met with force.
Ezra Ounce is merciless when aroused.

796
00:54:53,803 --> 00:54:55,134
Overture.

797
00:54:55,438 --> 00:54:57,099
Come on, everybody, places, will you?

798
00:54:57,273 --> 00:54:58,831
On stage. Everybody. Come on.

799
00:54:59,008 --> 00:55:00,566
Curtain.

800
00:55:06,082 --> 00:55:10,678
Ezra, have you discovered who is
backing this nefarious enterprise?

801
00:55:12,155 --> 00:55:15,124
We find out tonight. Tonight is my night.

802
00:55:15,725 --> 00:55:17,784
- W... Will you excuse me a minute?
- Gladly.

803
00:55:17,961 --> 00:55:19,223
Now, hurry back, Horace.

804
00:55:19,395 --> 00:55:21,226
I'll be right back. Yes.

805
00:55:21,397 --> 00:55:23,831
Not yet, Ezra, the handkerchief.

806
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,594
You can't stop the show
before it's started.

807
00:55:26,769 --> 00:55:29,067
Just a little excited, that's all.

808
00:55:31,307 --> 00:55:33,298
- Ezra.
- Thank you.

809
00:55:40,984 --> 00:55:42,713
Hey, I gotta talk to you.

810
00:55:42,886 --> 00:55:45,446
You certainly picked a swell time.
Places, everybody.

811
00:55:45,622 --> 00:55:48,557
- I mean it. This is serious.
- You're serious and I'm going daffy.

812
00:55:48,725 --> 00:55:51,558
- Tell Mabel to step on it, will you.
- Mabel, step on it.

813
00:55:51,728 --> 00:55:53,525
- This is the point.
- What is? Mabel?

814
00:55:53,696 --> 00:55:56,631
No, this. Ezra's gonna give me
$ 10 million tomorrow.

815
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:59,029
I'll give you a million dollars
if you don't open.

816
00:55:59,202 --> 00:56:01,636
My first show on Broadway.
Is Mabel ready?

817
00:56:01,804 --> 00:56:05,365
- Mabel, hurry up.
- I've worked, hoped, dreamed for this night.

818
00:56:05,542 --> 00:56:07,874
I've aged five years
and lost 12 pounds at rehearsal.

819
00:56:08,044 --> 00:56:10,706
I'm about to pull the curtain
on the most important thing...

820
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,348
...in my life and you come blubbering
for me to stop.

821
00:56:13,516 --> 00:56:15,541
- Scram, will you?
- I'll give you two million.

822
00:56:15,718 --> 00:56:18,209
I'll give you two seconds
to get out. Clear the stage.

823
00:56:18,388 --> 00:56:22,188
Hurry on, girls. Plenty of pep now.
Give me a big smile out there.

824
00:56:22,659 --> 00:56:24,957
On stage. Come on, hurry.

825
00:56:25,128 --> 00:56:26,652
Come on,
get out of here, will you?

826
00:56:26,829 --> 00:56:28,592
- Jimmy, I'm late.
- I'll say. Too late.

827
00:56:28,765 --> 00:56:31,097
- Barbara, what are you doing here?
- I'm in this show.

828
00:56:31,267 --> 00:56:33,292
You told me amateurs
couldn't play tennis.

829
00:56:33,469 --> 00:56:36,529
- Who's asking her to play tennis?
- If you step out on that stage...

830
00:56:36,706 --> 00:56:39,504
...you're no longer my daughter.
- We'll argue that later.

831
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:43,736
- I'm ready.
- She has on my costume. Take it off.

832
00:56:43,913 --> 00:56:46,040
Sorry, I take orders from Jimmy.
Hello, Horace.

833
00:56:46,216 --> 00:56:48,411
Jimmy, I couldn't sneak out
until after 8...

834
00:56:48,585 --> 00:56:52,112
...and my taxi got caught in a traffic jam.
- Well, you didn't show. Mabel did.

835
00:56:52,355 --> 00:56:55,984
- If you let her step on that stage, I'll...
- Get out of here, leave us alone...

836
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:58,150
...or I'll tell them
you're backing the show.

837
00:56:58,328 --> 00:56:59,761
No, no, don't do that. I'll go.

838
00:56:59,929 --> 00:57:02,864
Come on, get out.
All right, everybody, on stage. Come on.

839
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,825
I wonder what happened to Horace.

840
00:57:06,002 --> 00:57:08,334
I hope the excitement
isn't too much for him.

841
00:57:08,504 --> 00:57:10,870
He's so enthusiastic.

842
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,507
Oh, my.

843
00:57:13,676 --> 00:57:15,268
Thank you.

844
00:57:21,718 --> 00:57:23,982
Bulger, this elixir tastes a little strange.

845
00:57:24,153 --> 00:57:26,212
That's the new triple-strength kind.

846
00:57:26,389 --> 00:57:29,483
A case just came down
from Buffalo this afternoon.

847
00:57:29,659 --> 00:57:32,321
Oh, I'm so sorry you don't like it, Ezra.

848
00:57:32,495 --> 00:57:34,463
Who said I didn't like it?

849
00:57:36,966 --> 00:57:39,366
Kill your house lights.
Get ready for the curtain.

850
00:57:41,571 --> 00:57:44,404
Horace, where have you been?

851
01:04:24,874 --> 01:04:27,502
There's nothing so dreadful about that.
Think so, Ezra?

852
01:04:27,677 --> 01:04:30,646
Well, they're saving the worst
for later. Wait and see.

853
01:04:30,813 --> 01:04:33,509
No nudity at all. I'm disappointed.

854
01:04:33,683 --> 01:04:36,243
Agreeably, of course.

855
01:04:47,196 --> 01:04:49,061
Barbara.

856
01:04:50,566 --> 01:04:51,897
A fine "fishel" of kettle...

857
01:04:52,068 --> 01:04:55,765
Kettle of fish. Your daughter.
Treachery in our own ranks.

858
01:04:56,072 --> 01:05:01,135
Oh, Horace, the pity of it. Our daughter.
Our flesh and blood. A painted actress.

859
01:05:02,745 --> 01:05:05,771
Quick, Bulger, a bottle of that elixir.
Excitement has unnerved her.

860
01:05:05,948 --> 01:05:08,416
I don't feel so well myself.
Give me a bottle of...

861
01:05:08,584 --> 01:05:11,417
I'll take one if you don't mind.

862
01:05:11,921 --> 01:05:15,516
How can you control $ 10 million?
You can't even control your own daughter.

863
01:05:15,691 --> 01:05:18,558
Oh, Ezra, are you gonna
cut me off like a ripe banana?

864
01:05:18,828 --> 01:05:20,227
A ripe banana.

865
01:05:20,429 --> 01:05:22,226
I'm just a victim of fate.

866
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:03,766
<i>'Cause I only have eyes</i>

867
01:06:03,939 --> 01:06:06,669
<i>For you</i>

868
01:06:09,812 --> 01:06:11,370
- One seat, please.
- How many?

869
01:06:11,547 --> 01:06:14,015
- One.
- There you are.

870
01:06:18,487 --> 01:06:19,852
Got a couple in the balcony?

871
01:06:20,089 --> 01:06:23,183
Well, you got the last two, mister.
And am I glad.

872
01:06:29,165 --> 01:06:35,661
<i>And I only have eyes for you</i>

873
01:06:36,105 --> 01:06:39,734
<i>Are the stars out tonight?</i>

874
01:06:39,909 --> 01:06:42,969
<i>I don't know if it's cloudy or bright</i>

875
01:06:43,145 --> 01:06:49,641
<i>'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear</i>

876
01:06:49,819 --> 01:06:52,811
<i>The moon may be high</i>

877
01:06:52,988 --> 01:06:56,048
<i>But I can't see a thing in the sky</i>

878
01:06:56,225 --> 01:07:02,721
<i>'Cause I only have eyes for you</i>

879
01:07:03,399 --> 01:07:09,395
<i>I don't know if we're in a garden</i>

880
01:07:09,572 --> 01:07:14,339
<i>Or on a crowded avenue</i>

881
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:20,449
<i>You are here, so am I

882
01:07:20,616 --> 01:07:23,881
<i>Maybe millions of people go by</i>

883
01:07:24,053 --> 01:07:30,549
<i>But they all disappear from view</i>

884
01:07:30,726 --> 01:07:36,961
<i>And I only have eyes</i>

885
01:07:37,166 --> 01:07:40,795

<i>Are the stars out tonight?</i>

887
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:51,111
- He doesn't know if it's cloudy or bright.
- That's right.

888
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:56,843
<i>'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear</i>

889
01:07:57,019 --> 01:07:59,510
The moon may be high.

890
01:07:59,688 --> 01:08:02,486
- But he can't see a thing in the sky.
- Why?

891
01:08:02,658 --> 01:08:08,563
<i>'Cause I only have eyes for you</i>

892
01:08:08,731 --> 01:08:12,030
Now you don't know
if you're in a garden, do you?

893
01:08:12,201 --> 01:08:13,429
Come on, answer me.

894
01:08:14,270 --> 01:08:16,534
Or on a crowed avenue.

895
01:08:16,705 --> 01:08:19,503
Be truthful. Never mind.

896
01:08:19,675 --> 01:08:21,939
You're here, so am I.

897
01:08:22,111 --> 01:08:24,375
Maybe millions of people go by.

898
01:08:24,546 --> 01:08:27,276
- Yes, but they all disappear.
- Where?

899
01:08:27,449 --> 01:08:30,077
<i>From view</i>

900
01:08:30,252 --> 01:08:36,122
<i>And I only have eyes for you</i>

901
01:08:36,992 --> 01:08:40,655
<i>My love must be a kind of blind love</i>

902
01:08:41,864 --> 01:08:45,231
<i>I can't see anyone but you</i>

903
01:08:46,468 --> 01:08:51,167
<i>And, dear, I wonder if you find love</i>

904
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:56,903
<i>An optical illusion too?</i>

905
01:08:57,079 --> 01:09:00,242
<i>Are the stars out tonight?</i>

906
01:09:00,416 --> 01:09:03,112
<i>I don't know if it's cloudy or bright</i>

907
01:09:03,285 --> 01:09:08,917
<i>'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear</i>

908
01:09:09,091 --> 01:09:11,685
<i>The moon may be high</i>

909
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:14,556
<i>But I can't see a thing in the sky</i>

910
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:20,191
<i>'Cause I only have eyes for you</i>

911
01:09:20,369 --> 01:09:25,830
<i>Yes, I only have eyes</i>

912
01:09:26,241 --> 01:09:30,871
<i>For you</i>

913
01:14:07,856 --> 01:14:13,123
And I only have eyes for you.

914
01:14:41,823 --> 01:14:44,792
<i>Are the stars out tonight?</i>

915
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,622
<i>I don't know if it's cloudy or bright</i>

916
01:14:47,796 --> 01:14:53,257
<i>'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear</i>

917
01:14:53,435 --> 01:14:55,995
<i>The moon may be high</i>

918
01:14:56,171 --> 01:14:58,935
<i>But I can't see a thing in the sky</i>

919
01:14:59,107 --> 01:15:05,137
<i>'Cause I only have eyes for you</i>

920
01:15:05,314 --> 01:15:10,183
<i>I don't know if we're in a garden</i>

921
01:15:10,952 --> 01:15:14,820
<i>Or on a crowded avenue</i>

922
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:18,721
<i>You are here, so am I

923
01:15:18,894 --> 01:15:21,522
<i>Maybe millions of people go by</i>

924
01:15:21,697 --> 01:15:27,067
<i>But they all disappear from view</i>

925
01:15:27,235 --> 01:15:31,968
<i>And I only have eyes</i>

926
01:15:32,307 --> 01:15:37,404
<i>For you</i>

927
01:15:46,822 --> 01:15:48,289
Very beautiful.

928
01:15:48,457 --> 01:15:50,550
Very, very beautiful.

929
01:15:50,726 --> 01:15:55,823
Oh, very, very, very beautiful.

930
01:15:57,799 --> 01:16:02,759
Ezzy, you wouldn't cut off poor old
Horace like a ripe banana, would you?

931
01:16:02,938 --> 01:16:06,840
No, Horacey, not like a ripe banana.
Like a ripe avocado.

932
01:16:09,578 --> 01:16:11,603
Boys. Quiet.

933
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:14,011
- How we doing?
- We're doing all right.

934
01:16:14,182 --> 01:16:16,446
- The customers love you.
- Do you like me?

935
01:16:16,618 --> 01:16:19,348
- Do I what?
- Am I forgiven for being late?

936
01:16:19,521 --> 01:16:20,954
Ask me if I like you again.

937
01:16:21,123 --> 01:16:22,385
Do you like me, Jimmy?

938
01:16:22,557 --> 01:16:23,854
Now ask me if I love you.

939
01:16:24,025 --> 01:16:25,959
Well, do you love me?

940
01:16:26,128 --> 01:16:28,619
- Ask me after the show.
- You think I won't?

941
01:16:40,542 --> 01:16:44,273
I tell you, gentlemen. If I'm going to
put any money into this show...

942
01:16:44,446 --> 01:16:46,971
...I want to be sure that we get
the best music possible.

943
01:16:47,149 --> 01:16:50,209
You're absolutely right.
Great songs draw people into the theater.

944
01:16:50,385 --> 01:16:54,321
The story's what's important. I don't put
in a cent until we get the best playwright...

945
01:16:54,489 --> 01:16:57,049
Listen, nobody cares about the story.
People want songs.

946
01:16:57,225 --> 01:16:59,420
Right, V.C. We've got
to get good snappy music.

947
01:16:59,594 --> 01:17:01,562
You've got to have a great leading man.

948
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:03,493
You said it.

949
01:17:03,665 --> 01:17:06,065
- <i>Mr. McDonald of the Commercial Trust.</i>
- Can't see him.

950
01:17:06,234 --> 01:17:08,293
I tell you it's the story
that makes the show.

951
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:10,938
- No, sir, it's the cast.
- It's the publicity.

952
01:17:11,106 --> 01:17:12,903
The music.

953
01:17:13,575 --> 01:17:16,510
Gentlemen, please, please.
Just think for a moment.

954
01:17:16,678 --> 01:17:18,441
<i>Who writes the words and music</i>

955
01:17:18,613 --> 01:17:20,513
<i>For all the girlie shows?</i>

956
01:17:20,682 --> 01:17:24,482
<i>No one cares</i>
<i>And no one knows</i>

957
01:17:24,653 --> 01:17:26,416
<i>Who is the handsome hero</i>

958
01:17:26,588 --> 01:17:28,283
<i>Some villain always frames?</i>

959
01:17:28,457 --> 01:17:30,482
<i>But who cares if there's a plot or not</i>

960
01:17:30,659 --> 01:17:33,389
<i>When they've got a lot of dames?</i>

961
01:17:33,562 --> 01:17:35,496
<i>What do you go for?</i>

962
01:17:35,664 --> 01:17:37,996
<i>Go see a show for?</i>
<i>Tell the truth</i>

963
01:17:38,166 --> 01:17:41,658
<i>You go to see those beautiful dames</i>
<i>Yes, sir</i>

964
01:17:41,837 --> 01:17:45,034
<i>You spend your dough for</i>
<i>Bouquets that grow for</i>

965
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:49,166
<i>All those cute and cunning</i>
<i>Young and beautiful dames</i>

966
01:17:49,344 --> 01:17:52,609
<i>Oh, dames</i>
<i>Are temporary flames</i>

967
01:17:52,781 --> 01:17:54,908
<i>To you, dames</i>

968
01:17:55,083 --> 01:17:57,984
<i>You don't recall their names</i>
<i>Do you?</i>

969
01:17:58,153 --> 01:18:01,520
<i>But their caresses</i>
<i>And home addresses</i>

970
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:05,148
<i>Linger in your memory</i>
<i>Of those beautiful dames</i>

971
01:18:06,428 --> 01:18:08,020
- Yes?
- <i>Mr. Earl Farroll to see you.</i>

972
01:18:08,196 --> 01:18:10,061
- Can't see him.
- <i>Also Mr. George Hershwin.</i>

973
01:18:10,232 --> 01:18:11,995
Tell him, "Tomorrow." Now, gentlemen...

974
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:14,067
- Well?
- <i>Miss Dolly Devoe to see you.</i>

975
01:18:14,236 --> 01:18:15,999
Show her right in.

976
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:21,136
- Miss Devoe?
- Yes.

977
01:18:21,309 --> 01:18:23,743
- Come right in.
- Thank you. Kind of you to see me.

978
01:18:23,912 --> 01:18:26,472
Oh, not at all. Yes?

979
01:18:26,648 --> 01:18:30,049
- <i>Miss Dubin, Miss Warren, Miss Kelly, Miss...</i>
- Send them all in.

980
01:18:30,519 --> 01:18:32,851
Come right in, girls.

981
01:18:34,389 --> 01:18:36,118
<i>Leave your addresses</i>

982
01:18:36,791 --> 01:18:40,158
<i>My big successes</i>
<i>All depend a lot upon</i>

983
01:18:40,328 --> 01:18:42,523
<i>You beautiful dames</i>

984
01:18:43,231 --> 01:18:47,463
<i>As I was telling all those gentlemen</i>
<i>A while ago</i>

985
01:18:47,636 --> 01:18:50,537
<i>That what do we go for</i>

986
01:18:50,705 --> 01:18:52,935
<i>Go see a show for</i>
<i>Tell the truth</i>

987
01:18:53,108 --> 01:18:56,271
<i>We go to see you beautiful dames</i>

988
01:18:57,212 --> 01:19:00,978
<i>We spend our dough for</i>
<i>Bouquets that grow for</i>

989
01:19:01,149 --> 01:19:05,609
<i>All you cute and cunning</i>
<i>Young and beautiful dames</i>

990
01:19:05,787 --> 01:19:10,747
<i>Oh, dames are necessary</i>
<i>To show business</i>

991
01:19:10,926 --> 01:19:15,192
<i>Dames, without you there would be</i>
<i>No business</i>

992
01:19:15,363 --> 01:19:18,855
<i>Your knees in action</i>
<i>That's the attraction</i>

993
01:19:19,034 --> 01:19:23,471
<i>And what good's a show</i>
<i>Without you beautiful dames?</i>

994
01:19:23,939 --> 01:19:26,271
<i>Rehearsal tomorrow, 11:00</i>

995
01:19:26,441 --> 01:19:28,602
<i>Be there promptly by then</i>

996
01:19:28,777 --> 01:19:31,837
<i>Better set your alarm clocks for 9

997
01:19:32,013 --> 01:19:37,041
<i>At least no later than 10</i>

998
01:27:06,901 --> 01:27:12,430
Hooray for the Ounce Foundation
For the Elevation of Celebration. Hooray.

999
01:27:12,607 --> 01:27:16,008
The O.P. For the E. Of the A.F.M.

1000
01:27:16,978 --> 01:27:20,607
Boys. Be quiet.
Those people are all staring at you.

1001
01:27:20,782 --> 01:27:23,808
Well, they couldn't be staring
at a better couple of men.

1002
01:27:24,419 --> 01:27:27,513
- He's getting ready.
- It won't be long now.

1003
01:28:04,725 --> 01:28:07,455
That creature's trying to lure you boys.

1004
01:28:07,628 --> 01:28:11,462
Impossible. I never even
saw her before in my whole life.

1005
01:28:11,632 --> 01:28:14,726
She's a very nice, friendly young lady.

1006
01:28:41,796 --> 01:28:43,491
Stop this show.

1007
01:28:48,269 --> 01:28:50,203
Keep going. Keep going, girls.

1008
01:28:50,838 --> 01:28:53,932
What's the matter? Girls, girls.

1009
01:28:56,644 --> 01:28:58,839
Oh, Ezra, you started it, now stop it.

1010
01:28:59,013 --> 01:29:00,640
I knew I should've stayed at home.

1011
01:29:36,984 --> 01:29:38,918
Quiet. Quiet.

1012
01:29:39,086 --> 01:29:41,850
Oh, Horace, get away from
those shameless women.

1013
01:29:42,023 --> 01:29:46,119
Oh, Mathilda, go away
and leave me alone. I'm in jail.

1014
01:29:47,061 --> 01:29:48,289
Silence.

1015
01:29:48,462 --> 01:29:52,023
Mr. Ounce, I've arranged to
get you out of this terrible jail.

1016
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,498
Yes, but I don't wanna
get out of jail. I like it.

1017
01:29:54,669 --> 01:29:57,695
I never had a better time in my life.

1018
01:29:58,673 --> 01:30:01,836
But, Ezra, think
of the Ounce Foundation.

1019
01:30:02,009 --> 01:30:04,136
You know what I think
of the Ounce Foundation?

1020
01:30:04,312 --> 01:30:05,540
Phooey.

1021
01:30:08,249 --> 01:30:12,185
We'll get a million dollars' worth of publicity
out of this. The show will run a year.

1022
01:30:12,353 --> 01:30:14,685
Maybe we owe Uncle Ezra
a vote of thanks.

1023
01:30:14,855 --> 01:30:16,846
I'll offer him a job
as company press agent.

1024
01:30:17,024 --> 01:30:20,516
Say, by the way, I was going
to ask you something after the show.

1025
01:30:20,695 --> 01:30:21,923
Is it all right now?

1026
01:30:22,096 --> 01:30:24,929
You couldn't pick a better time
or a better place.

1027
01:30:40,514 --> 01:30:42,505
