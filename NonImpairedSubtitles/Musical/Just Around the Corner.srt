- Is my daddy here?

Penny, come here, please.

16
00:01:30,314 --> 00:01:33,875
Penny, I have some
sad news for you.

17
00:01:33,984 --> 00:01:36,145
But you'll be a brave
little girl, won't you?

18
00:01:36,253 --> 00:01:39,347
- Is it about my daddy?
- Yes, Penny.

19
00:01:39,457 --> 00:01:43,518
- Has anything happened to him?
- No. No, dear, no.

20
00:01:43,627 --> 00:01:47,495
But he's sent for you.
You're going to leave us.

21
00:01:47,598 --> 00:01:52,058
<i>- Are you gonna take me right now, Gus?
Right this minute?
- Yes, Miss Penny.</i>

22
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:54,899
- I'm gonna live with my daddy at the Riverview?
- Yes, Miss Penny.

23
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:57,064
On and on, for keeps?

24
00:01:57,174 --> 00:01:59,472
- Yes, Miss Penny.
- Oh, Gus!

25
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:02,808
Maybe I'd better
wait outside.

26
00:02:02,913 --> 00:02:05,848
It's very sad news, Miss Vincent,
but I wanna be brave...

27
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,885
even though I am
gonna miss everybody so much.

28
00:02:08,986 --> 00:02:11,511
- And now I'd better pack. Don't you think?
- Oh, yes.

29
00:02:11,622 --> 00:02:14,386
- It's not polite to keep people waiting.
- No, dear.

30
00:02:14,492 --> 00:02:16,653
Please, may I be excused?

31
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,522
I feel awful sad about
leaving you, Miss Vincent.

32
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:22,690
- Good-bye! [Laughs]
- Good-bye.

33
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,360
<i>- Good-bye, Miss Burns.
- [Door Closes]</i>

34
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:29,428
I wonder why Mr. Hale is taking her
out of school so suddenly.

35
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,940
They're going abroad,
no doubt.

36
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:35,409
It wouldn't be finances.
His last check is overdue.

37
00:02:35,513 --> 00:02:37,674
Finances? Hardly--

38
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:39,976
with the Riverview
as an address?

39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,099
- Why, Miss Penny.
- Hello, Corporal.

40
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:08,235
- Please don't stop me now.
I've gotta find my daddy.
- Wait a minute.

41
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:10,711
Hey, Penny,
come back here!

42
00:03:10,814 --> 00:03:13,908
Fine doorman you are-- Lettin' her go
right through the door.

43
00:03:14,018 --> 00:03:16,213
What kind of a doorman
you call that?

44
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,221
Hello, Mr. Waters.
I'm back.

45
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:21,621

<i>J'habite ici.
"I live here."</i>

That proves
how stupid you are.

63
00:04:29,593 --> 00:04:32,460
- You don't live here and neither does she.
- Don't mind him.

64

He's all mixed up. I'm the one
who lives here-- My daddy and me.

65
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,828
I beg your pardon.
This is my uncle's apartment.

66
00:04:38,936 --> 00:04:43,464
I live here with my mother and my sister and
my Uncle Sam. Now, kindly vacate our premises.

67

Do you think I don't know where I live?
We've lived here three years.

you'd better get out and--

embarrassed. Come along, Miss Hale, quickly.</i>

00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:56,684
- But why?
- Run along, little girl. Scat! Shoo!

- I'm taking you to your daddy right now.

- This is very unfortunate. I apologize.

It will never happen again.
I assure you. I'm very sorry.

Children are impossible
these days.

77

They don't ask if they live
in your house, they just tell you.

78
00:05:14,938 --> 00:05:18,271
They walk right in and tell you.
You haven't a moment of privacy...

without some child coming in
to tell you she lives with you.

80
00:05:21,045 --> 00:05:23,377
Mother, I pointed out her
mistake to her emphatically--

- not only in English, but in French.
- In French? Bah!

82

But why did Daddy move?
He liked our penthouse, and I loved it.

Oh, questions, questions.

109
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,614
I went up
to the penthouse.

110
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,048
A lot of funny people
live there now.

111
00:07:08,152 --> 00:07:10,552
No wonder you moved
down here.

112
00:07:10,654 --> 00:07:13,145
- Did Gus take you up there?
- Oh, no.

113
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:16,488
I just supposed--
I mean, I thought--

114
00:07:16,593 --> 00:07:18,788
Gus didn't take me.

115
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,956
Well, he's working for those people now
because we haven't any job for him.

116
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:25,728
- I... sold our car.
- Oh.

117
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:30,330
Well, then, you and I are gonna have
a lot of nice walks together, aren't we?

118
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,965
Oh, sure.
Do you remember--

119
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:36,341
Do you remember how hard I used to
work before you went away to school?

120
00:07:36,446 --> 00:07:39,347
How I was always planning buildings
and putting them up?

121
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:41,508
We had hardly any time at all
to be together.

122
00:07:41,618 --> 00:07:43,586
And you were tired
all the time.

123
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:46,520
Well, that wasn't so good,
was it?  But it made money.

124
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:51,686
We had money to live in a penthouse
and have a car and Gus and all the others.

125
00:07:51,795 --> 00:07:54,320
But now it's awfully hard
to get jobs.

126
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:56,831
There seem to be enough buildings,
so I'm not working...

127
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,027
and we haven't so much
in our pocketbook.

128
00:07:59,136 --> 00:08:03,334
But you see what that means? It means
we have all that extra time to be together.

129
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,772
- That's a lot better, isn't it?
- Sure it is.

130
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:08,777
But there's one thing
I want to do.

131
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,905
There's one thing
I want to finish.

132
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:15,849
That's the one building
your daddy wants to finish.

133
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:20,252
- Why?
- I put all my money into it.

134
00:08:20,357 --> 00:08:23,724
A lot of other men did too,
because it took a great deal.

135
00:08:23,827 --> 00:08:29,231
Then we had bad times, and a banker
came along and took it away from us.

136
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,392
- What's a banker?
- [Chuckles]

137
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:34,436
Well, a banker--

138
00:08:34,538 --> 00:08:39,373
A banker is a sort of person that, uh--
that keeps things that belong to other people.

139
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:42,206
- You mean a burglar?
- [Chuckling] Oh, no.

140
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:44,303
No, darling, not that.

141
00:08:44,414 --> 00:08:48,043
But we're not licked. And your daddy
is gonna make that banker understand...

142
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:50,415
that he must let me
go through with the deal.

143
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,489
And then we can move upstairs,
and you can go back to school.

144
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,252
Who wants to go upstairs
and go back to school?

145
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,988
Not me.
I like it here.

146
00:08:59,096 --> 00:09:02,224
There aren't so many stairs to climb,
and the rooms are small.

147
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:05,768
- I don't have to walk around so much.
- [Laughing]

148
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:08,497
- Oh!
- My legs are so short...

149
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:12,132
it used to wear me out walking across

talk to me about vision.

Who let you in here,
young man?

303
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:20,616
If you want the truth, Lola did.
She believes in this project.

304
00:19:20,717 --> 00:19:23,948
- She believes in me.
- And I believe that you are the nerviest rascal...

305
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:27,216
that I ever met
in a life knee-deep in rascals.

306
00:19:27,323 --> 00:19:31,953
Using my niece to get in here, feeding her
your crack-brained schemes.

307
00:19:32,061 --> 00:19:35,519
- Careful. Remember your stomach.
- You leave my stomach out of it.

308
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:39,864
You leave her out of it too.
She's crack-brained enough without your help.

309
00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:42,699
She's the sanest one
in the family at that.

310

- Git!

- Awful.

315
00:19:59,422 --> 00:20:01,754
Oh, darling, sit down,
tell me all about it.

316
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:05,419
There isn't much to tell.
I told him, and then he told me.

317
00:20:05,528 --> 00:20:08,827
- But he had an edge.
- And he wouldn't even listen
to what you had to say?

318
00:20:08,932 --> 00:20:10,991
Honestly, darling,
even if he is my own uncle--

319
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,500
Don't bother. You can't
call him anything that I haven't.

320
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:17,266
Jeff, I know how
we can get around him.

321
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:20,274
- Oh, let's forget about it.
- Oh, so, you're quitting?

322
00:20:20,376 --> 00:20:22,401
I'm not quitting,
but what can I do?

323
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,980
Listen, Jeff, I've been
handling him since I was a little girl...

324
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:27,106
and I've always
gotten what I wanted.

325
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:30,276
You won't get anywhere trying to
fight with him. You've got to go around him.

326
00:20:30,386 --> 00:20:34,152
- Come on. Let's try it my way.
- Just to make conversation, what's your way?

327
00:20:34,257 --> 00:20:36,987
- By way of Connecticut. Come on.
- Connecticut?

328
00:20:37,093 --> 00:20:39,084
- What'll we do in Connecticut?
- Get married.

329
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:41,254
- Married?
- Don't you see? Once you're in the family...

330
00:20:41,364 --> 00:20:43,332
my uncle would have to
do something.

331
00:20:43,433 --> 00:20:45,993
- His pride would be at stake.
- What about my pride?

332
00:20:46,102 --> 00:20:48,502
You can be proud when
the building's built and people live in it.

333
00:20:48,605 --> 00:20:52,132
- It's a failure now. You can't be proud of that.
- You don't understand.

334
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:54,709
What good would it do me
to get it that way?

335
00:20:54,811 --> 00:20:57,302
Supposing it flopped?
Then look. Married.

Starting out married life
in the basement.

337

But, darling, I don't care
where I live if it's with you.

338
00:21:01,884 --> 00:21:05,786
That's what you think now. But you wouldn't
think so as month after month passed on.

339
00:21:05,888 --> 00:21:09,289
First, you'd make up with the old weasel,
then you'd start calling on the penthouse.

340
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:12,225
Before long, you'd see no reason why
I shouldn't move up there with you.

341

much faith you have in my love for you.

you think I'm a quitter too.

So I'm a quitter?
That's a lovely sentiment.

345

Nice to know. All right.
I'll prove it to you.

00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:36,608
Well, maybe this picture will make
you understand. You see all these people:

445
00:27:36,712 --> 00:27:39,340
<i>The farmer, the housewife,
the laborer--</i>

446
00:27:39,448 --> 00:27:42,576
<i>Look what they're doing.
They're all pulling...</i>

447
00:27:42,685 --> 00:27:46,280
on this one poor fellow,
Uncle Sam.

448
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:50,450
- What has he done?
- He's done everything he can,
and still it's not enough.

449
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,687
He gives and he gives,
and he tries to make everything right...

450
00:27:53,796 --> 00:27:56,287
but there just doesn't seem
to be any end to it.

451
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,197
- Is he the president?
- He's greater than the president, darling.

452
00:27:59,301 --> 00:28:03,795
He's the most important thing
in the whole country, maybe in the world.

453
00:28:03,906 --> 00:28:07,569
I don't think it's fair for everybody
worrying Uncle Sam...

454
00:28:07,676 --> 00:28:10,873
especially when he gives
all the money he can all the time.

455
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,472
It's not only money, darling.
He has to find places for people to live...

456
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:17,074
and clothes for them to wear,
find jobs.

457
00:28:17,186 --> 00:28:19,211
That's the most important thing.

- Hmm.

459
00:28:23,692 --> 00:28:28,720
Daddy, it's a wonder somebody
doesn't try to help Uncle Sam for a change.

460
00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:31,163
Well, lots of us try.

461
00:28:31,267 --> 00:28:34,100
Well, I hope Uncle Sam
doesn't get discouraged.

462
00:28:34,203 --> 00:28:37,502
Don't you worry about that.
He's a tough old bird.

463
00:28:37,606 --> 00:28:39,801
And pretty soon,
he'll be back on his feet...

464
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:43,276
stronger than ever,
and then watch things boom.

465
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:46,974
And I'll build the tallest buildings
in the whole world, and lots of them.

Black eye with your hair cut. Huh!

Now, then, young lady,
did you cut Milton's curls off?

- Yeah. Where's his fancy pants?

Mugsy has them on now.
Milton traded him.

it's an awful shock to you.

I don't mind if you're sour and cross.

Yeah.
Well, upon my soul.

Do you think I ought to tell my daddy
that she's in love with him so much?

Oh, he'll undoubtedly
find out for himself...

although we could probably save considerable time
if we wanted to cooperate.

about her, she'd feel better.

It might be interesting psychologically.
[Clears Throat]

No. I'm supposed to be helping

All right. Tell me what you've
been doing with yourself.

640
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:57,516
I've been very busy
taking care of my daddy.

641
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:01,087
By the way, how is he?

642
00:40:01,189 --> 00:40:05,523
When he's with me, he's—he's fine,
but I don't think he's so cheerful inside.

643
00:40:05,627 --> 00:40:09,927
Well, maybe you just imagine that.
Or do you think he has something on his mind?

644
00:40:10,031 --> 00:40:15,128
- I think he's worried.
- Probably because he hasn't any buildings to build.

645
00:40:15,237 --> 00:40:20,300
- I think he's worried about you.
- Oh, Penny, you're just guessing.

646
00:40:20,408 --> 00:40:25,107
- What makes you think so?
- Because he's always asking me
questions about you.

647
00:40:25,213 --> 00:40:29,047
- Just like you're asking me questions about him.
- Oh, Penny!

648
00:40:30,252 --> 00:40:33,653
Goodness, you must
feel better.

There's a short circuit.

- Sure, it is. It'd be better if I'd made it up myself.

658

Just like "Hail Columbia." [Laughs]

Oh, yes, of course.

Now see here. You've outshouted this family
for years, but you're not going to outshout me.

728
00:45:25,847 --> 00:45:29,283
- I love that man, and I'm going to marry him.
- Over my dead body you'll marry.

729
00:45:29,384 --> 00:45:32,945
- I'm going to marry him
if it's over everybody's dead body.
- You won't marry him!

730
00:45:33,054 --> 00:45:36,751
If you'd only listen to him about that
East Gate project, instead of being
a stupid old--

731
00:45:36,858 --> 00:45:39,418
- old--old--
- Old, uh, what, my dear?

732
00:45:39,527 --> 00:45:42,758
Oh, I'm sorry, Uncle Sam.
Really I am. But I'm not giving in.

733
00:45:42,864 --> 00:45:45,594
- I'm going to marry Jeff Hale.
- Well, you win.

734
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,669
Uh, you wouldn't be my niece
if you didn't have a will of your own.

735
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:51,364
Uncle Sam,
you don't mean it?

736
00:45:51,473 --> 00:45:54,670
You're going to, uh,
live in the basement, I suppose?

737
00:45:54,776 --> 00:45:58,678
We won't have to live in the basement
if you'll listen to Jeff. He has so much to offer.

738
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:01,647
All he needs is to have someone
cooperate instead of fighting him.

739
00:46:01,749 --> 00:46:03,808
If you'll just
do something for him.

740
00:46:03,918 --> 00:46:08,651
<i>- Well, maybe I can do something for him.

[Sputters]

742
00:46:11,893 --> 00:46:15,021
Some change in tone,
my dear.

743
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,963
Yeah. Hello.
Henshaw speaking.

744
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:25,369
A little matter you can
attend to for me, Black.

745
00:46:26,508 --> 00:46:28,499
Yeah.

746
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:32,512
The pipeline we propose to lay in Dutch Borneo
will run from here to here.

747
00:46:32,614 --> 00:46:34,582
What is the terrain like,
Mr. Black?

748
00:46:34,682 --> 00:46:37,879
Well, there's a range of mountains here,
and then swamp and jungle.

749
00:46:37,986 --> 00:46:39,977
- Tough going?
- Very tough.

750
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,579
That's why we need a good man
to superintend the job.

751
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:46,182
- How did you happen to pick me?
- You were highly recommended
by a friend of mine.

752
00:46:46,294 --> 00:46:48,660
- Uh, cigarette?
- Thank you, no.

753
00:46:48,763 --> 00:46:53,200
After all, the man who carried on
with the East Gate project against the
odds that you did--

754
00:46:53,301 --> 00:46:55,997
- It's too bad you couldn't go through with it.
- I will someday.

755
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:58,504
Mmm. I'm sure of it.

756
00:46:58,606 --> 00:47:02,406
In the meantime, here's a job that needs
doing right now and will pay well.

757
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:05,274
- I could surely use it.
- Eh, you're not married, are you?

758
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,780
- No, not yet.
- That's good.

759
00:47:07,882 --> 00:47:11,682
We don't send family men out in that country.
You'll have to leave right away.

760
00:47:11,786 --> 00:47:14,277
How long should the job take?

761
00:47:14,389 --> 00:47:17,017
You'd have to sign up
for two years.

762
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:25,426
Borneo.

763
00:47:25,533 --> 00:47:30,061
Jeff, you can't go. You simply can't go to the end
of the world and leave us here.

764
00:47:30,171 --> 00:47:33,038
Do you think for a moment
I want to go?

765
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,109
Oh, it's a grand job,
a wonderful chance...

766
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:38,805
but if I had anything half as good here,
l-- I wouldn't even consider it.

767
00:47:38,913 --> 00:47:43,816
But you'll have something here if you wait.
Uncle promised to do something.

768
00:47:43,918 --> 00:47:49,413
I don't want that sort of job.
I told you before.

769
00:47:49,524 --> 00:47:52,891
- Jeff, I'm going with you.
- Now, that's the spirit.

770
00:47:52,994 --> 00:47:56,327
You can't go, but--
but just the same, that's the spirit.

771
00:47:56,431 --> 00:48:00,265
You see, they--they won't
take a married man on the job.

772
00:48:00,368 --> 00:48:04,099
Oh, but, Jeff, think how long it is,
how desperately long.

773
00:48:04,205 --> 00:48:07,231
Two whole years to wait.

774
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:10,402
I know.
I wanted to tell you.

775
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:14,470
I'm not asking you
to wait for me, Lola. It's not fair.

776
00:48:14,582 --> 00:48:16,948
Now, look here,
Jeff Hale.

777
00:48:17,051 --> 00:48:22,489
- I can't stop you from going, but you just
try to stop me from waiting for you.
- Mmm.

778
00:48:25,426 --> 00:48:27,485
<i>Good morning,
Miss Penny.</i>

779
00:48:27,595 --> 00:48:31,258
Corporal,
where's Borneo?

780
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:34,335
Uh, Borneo?
[Clears Throat] Borneo?

781
00:48:34,435 --> 00:48:36,596
Oh. Uh, he's moved up
into Harlem.

782
00:48:36,704 --> 00:48:40,504
Borneo isn't a man.
It's a place. Where is it?

783
00:48:40,608 --> 00:48:43,634
Borneo-- Oh, sure.

784
00:48:43,745 --> 00:48:47,681
That's where that big light
come from in the sky... nights.

785
00:48:47,782 --> 00:48:52,719
- What light?
- The aurora, uh, "borenalis."

786
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:55,448
- Everybody's heard of that.
- I haven't.

787
00:48:55,556 --> 00:48:59,515
Well, it's sorta north--
way up north near the North Pole.

788
00:48:59,627 --> 00:49:03,654
- That's where Borneo is.
- Full of icebergs and polar bears?

789
00:49:03,765 --> 00:49:06,632
Yes, ma'am.

790
00:49:06,734 --> 00:49:10,864
Just stick your little nose outside of the door,
and you'll freeze to death.

791
00:49:10,972 --> 00:49:14,203
And if the "polo" bears
don't eat you, the Eskimos do.

792
00:49:14,309 --> 00:49:17,107
Oh.

793
00:49:24,485 --> 00:49:26,749
- Gus.
- Yeah?

794
00:49:26,854 --> 00:49:29,823
Gus, this is important.
I want a man's angle on it.

795
00:49:29,924 --> 00:49:31,892
- On what?
- Borneo.

796
00:49:31,993 --> 00:49:34,587
Bo-- Now, listen, beautiful.
I'm in a hurry.

797
00:49:34,696 --> 00:49:37,688
So am I.
I've only got a few days.

798
00:49:37,799 --> 00:49:40,267
- Where's Borneo?
- B-- Uh--

799
00:49:40,368 --> 00:49:42,928
It's, um--
It's near Gibraltar.

800
00:49:43,037 --> 00:49:47,838
- Where's Gibraltar?
- Well, I just told ya. It's, uh—It's near Borneo.

801
00:49:47,942 --> 00:49:51,036
Didn't you ever hear
of  ‘The Wild Man of Borneo?’
That's it.

802
00:49:51,145 --> 00:49:55,946
Wild men, lions, tigers,
swamps, fevers, uh--

803
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:59,076
Well, I gotta get to work.

804
00:49:59,187 --> 00:50:03,715
- The Corporal said it was
full of icebergs and polar bears.
- Aw, that's in winter.

805
00:50:03,825 --> 00:50:08,592
If anyone had lived there for two years,
could they ever come back alive?

806
00:50:08,696 --> 00:50:11,631
Not a chance.

807
00:50:11,733 --> 00:50:17,365
Now, you stay right here in little old
New York and let Borneo take care of itself.

808
00:50:23,411 --> 00:50:27,643
But please, you'll do everything
you can think of, won't you?

809
00:50:27,749 --> 00:50:31,116
I--I mean, if one thing doesn't work,
you won't stop.

810
00:50:31,219 --> 00:50:33,380
- You'll go right on.
- Count on me, darling.

811
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:36,480
I want him to stay here
just as much as you do.

812
00:50:36,591 --> 00:50:39,992
Not quite as much,
because, after all...

813
00:50:40,094 --> 00:50:43,495
you've got Milton and--
and all, and I'll be alone.

814
00:50:43,598 --> 00:50:46,499
But, Miss Lola...

815
00:50:46,601 --> 00:50:51,163
even if he says no a hundred
thousand times, you just insist.

816
00:50:51,272 --> 00:50:56,175
If you insist long enough
with my daddy, he always gives in...

817
00:50:56,277 --> 00:50:58,336
sometimes.

818
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:15,256
Hey, what are you doing
with those shirts?

819
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:20,665
I have to look them over. You can't go
to Borneo without buttons on your shirts.

820
00:51:28,643 --> 00:51:31,771
My socks.
But you've looked them over.

821
00:51:31,879 --> 00:51:35,144
Oh, sure, once,
but I have to double-check.

822
00:51:35,249 --> 00:51:37,945
I wouldn't think of letting you go
without double-checking.

823
00:51:38,052 --> 00:51:40,213
That's the second time
you've rated those socks.

824
00:51:40,321 --> 00:51:42,721
Aren't they
double-checked enough?

825
00:51:42,824 --> 00:51:46,851
Well, after all these are socks.
You can't check them too much.

826
00:51:46,961 --> 00:51:49,486
You might find a hole
in a sock anytime...

827
00:51:49,597 --> 00:51:51,895
and then what would
those "Borneonians" say?

828
00:51:51,999 --> 00:51:57,403
They'd say, "Now, what kind of a woman
is taking care of this poor man?"

829
00:51:57,505 --> 00:52:01,635
There! Just look at that.
And this is a triple-check.

830
00:52:01,742 --> 00:52:03,710
[Chuckles Quietly]

831
00:52:03,811 --> 00:52:07,645
What you would do a way off in Borneo
without me to look after you...

832
00:52:07,748 --> 00:52:09,716
I hardly can imagine.

833
00:52:09,817 --> 00:52:12,081
I don't think I'll pack
any more today.

834
00:52:12,186 --> 00:52:15,519
After all, there's no hurry.
We still have two more full days.

835
00:52:15,623 --> 00:52:18,148
- And you might not go.
- What's that?

836
00:52:18,259 --> 00:52:20,591
Anything can happen
in two days.

837
00:52:20,695 --> 00:52:25,189
What if somebody did something for Uncle Sam,
and Uncle Sam did something for business?

838
00:52:25,299 --> 00:52:27,392
Then you wouldn't have to go
to Borneo, would you?

839
00:52:27,502 --> 00:52:29,527
No, I wouldn't
have to go, Penny.

840
00:52:29,637 --> 00:52:32,606
But don't you count on it, partner,
because it won't happen.
