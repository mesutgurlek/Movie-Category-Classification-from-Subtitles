2
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,167
Halli means village.

3
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,772
It's one of the villages in between
of Karnataka and Kerala.

4
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,675
Only poor people live there.

5
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,686
Many languages..Many cuIture...

6
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:58,522
They follow their own rules
and principles.

7
00:00:59,225 --> 00:00:59,850
That follows here.

8
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,891
It's time for moon to rise...

9
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,074
You sing...

10
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:18,760
In this country people gets excites
seeing the rain clouds.

11
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:24,774
Paddy sways towards the left.

12
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:31,106
In this country parrot's
songs flow like honey.

13
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:37,119
Even waste lands become fertile when
the river flows through them.

14
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:43,292
l'm also coming with gold
ornaments etc.

15
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,502
With the beats produced by the
crane on the pond.

16
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:35,678
Oh my bulls, please
run fast.

17
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:41,681
Anxiously waiting to reach the
country which is far off.

18
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:48,016
ls the country which l like most.

19
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:54,026
You also come to this
cold place.

20
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,424
Hey Manickam -Yes brother.

21
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,600
Why're you late?

22
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,770
No pick up like before. -What?

23
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,441
l meant that l didn't have
the old pick up.

24
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:19,114
Whatever it's lets wash our faces
in the temple tank and go home.

25
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,949
There's water in the cart
gargle your mouth.

26
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,285
Take 2 caramoms from the box and
chew them.That's all.

27
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,629
Yes...Yes...It's not like earlier.

28
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:36,458
She'll know that l've had liquor
the moment she smells cardamom.

29
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,795
That's right. Will anybody chew cardamom
early in the morning?

30
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,810
There's another trick brother.
-Don't tell me.

31
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,640
Whenever l listened to your words
l got into trouble.

32
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,915
You just listen to what l say.

33
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:51,978
Stop...

34
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,992
While talking about the fare
to Yashodhama.

35
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,491
Don't tell her that
l drank liquor.

36
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,219
l'll not tell even if l'm beheaded.

37
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,155
Do you want to gargle your mouth?

38
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,333
l don't want...l'm not drunk, right?
- l'll give you blow.

39
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,828
Manickam, are you doing fine?

40
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,327
Nothing special.

41
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:13,831
Greetings sir.

42
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,837
How was the fair this time?

43
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,506
ls this the fair Munuswamy?

44
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,838
Fair'll look like a fair only after
the month of Kumbham(Feb-March).

45
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,859
You idiot...

46
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,192
How many times l've told you not to stand,

47
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,421
With the broom and water l come out
early in the morning.

48
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,759
Why did you come out when l was standing
with the broom and water?

49
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,597
l've not seen a fool
like you anywhere, ruined.

50
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,205
When did you come back
from the fair?

51
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,275
l came at dawn -Where are those 2?

52
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,841
Brother and Manickam are coming behind?

53
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,774
He said, he'll deliver the things in the fair
bathe the bull & take the cart.

54
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:02,110
He might be fully drunk!
- l've no idea.

55
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,620
l didn't see him going to the toddy shop.
-Then what did you see?

56
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,292
l saw him coming out of the
toddy shop.

57
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:11,228
Oh he must be without 'dhothi'.

58
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,293
He had the dhothi.

59
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:15,293
But he had wrapped it around his head
so that it'll not be removed.

60
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:16,794
Oh my god!

61
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,571
You came here without bringing him
after seeing him in that condition.

62
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,742
l called him but he rebuked
me a lot.

63
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,808
l reached Rajamadai
at the break of dawn.

64
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,810
That time l heard bus people saying
that he fought at the fair.

65
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,309
Lord is a poor man.

66
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,983
He got spoiled after he became
friendly with Manickam.

67
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,152
Don't tell him that l told you all this.

68
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,998
Why did you bad mouth Manickam?

69
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,659
Just because he's bad.
He's also a servant here.

70
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,498
But he thinks he is the lord here.

71
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,338
Only after he's chucked out form here
this family'll be saved.

72
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,337
Watch...l'll tell Manickam about it.

73
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,679
l don't care...Why should l be
scared of him?

74
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:06,011
lf he plays the fool with me
l'll urge the bull to kick him & kill him.

75
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,084
Who is more important to you, me or him?

76
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,951
Don't forget l'm your Fiancee.

77
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,359
After the harvest l should
only marry you.

78
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,524
ls it enough if only you decide
about my marriage?

79
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,526
That was your father's promise.

80
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,289
Then marry my father.

81
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,291
Don't l've to go to heaven for that?

82
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,369
Lord is coming.

83
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:59,063
Injimuda Gandhari would've got the
information, isn't it Manickam?

84
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,567
Then...This time we bought
spritely cows.

85
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,404
Why to bother about the price?

86
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,905
We can see at the fair how fast it runs.

87
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:11,243
This time l'll make the honour of the
Gandhari fly like the kite.

88
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,920
Only then Yashodama
will understand us.

89
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,647
l've already understood you people.

90
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:23,926
Hey tell the truth did you drink toddy
-Me? Toddy?

91
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,190
Oh god! -Tell me the truth?
Drank toddy?

92
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,164
l didn't. -Not you...l asked
you. Did he drink?

93
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,597
No... -No?

94
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,605
Now tell me didn't be drink?
-He drank.

95
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,108
Now a days you've started
telling lies to me.

96
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,943
Since l got it free
l drank a glass of toddy.

97
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,446
That was to feel good. lf it was wrong
forgive me. -Enough?

98
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,949
Didn't you pick up a fight?
-Fight? Me?

99
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:56,125
Oh god! Who told you all this?
Manickam, did you hear?

100
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,126
That's a lie...Nothing happened like that.

101
00:09:58,664 --> 00:09:59,460
Keep your hand on the head.

102
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,896
Not on your head but
on my head.

103
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,136
Tell me what happened in the fair
after he drank toddy?

104
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,069
That was nothing in particular.

105
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,807
His leg slipped and he fell.
That's all.

106
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:13,808
What happened next?

107
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:17,312
Where he fell, there
was a strength less pillar too.

108
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:18,479
Even that fell along with him.

109
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:19,810
That's what happened? -Yes.

110
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,249
There was a pot under the pillar.

111
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,150
That broke...That's all that happened.
And we came back.

112
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,657
Keep your hand here.

113
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,995
Was there a fight due to
the breaking of the pot?

114
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:36,494
Not 1 pot...There were 10-20 pots
on top of that pot.

115
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:40,001
As soon as the pot at the bottom broke
others also broke into pieces.

116
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,002
It's natural.

117
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:44,335
One of the broken pieces
hit the glass of the lorry.

118
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:48,775
Broken pieces hit the glass only that
much had happened -It's natural.

119
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,846
Lorry man wasn't reconciled when this
drunk tried to explain to him?

120
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,679
So we called the policeman and
explained the sequence to him.

121
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:55,854
And we left the place.
That's all that happened there.

122
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,781
Hey tell me clearly.

123
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,122
Okay, l'll tell it clearly.
Lorry man had hit our lord.

124
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,855
He hit him back.
There was a severe fight.

125
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:06,861
Then policeman arrived and
filed the case.

126
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,697
Oh god!...Were you beaten
up badly?

127
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,700
l got 3 blows and l gave
back 10-20 blows.

128
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,032
Since he was injured badly
so l didn't...

129
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,037
Then we didn't stay
there any longer.

130
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,209
When policeman arrived and filed the case

131
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,378
We told him not to file the case we'll not...

132
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,876
We told him that Yashodama's
waiting for us.

133
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:27,212
''We came here to get a saree
for her for pongal''.

134
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:31,147
So we came back here after getting
a grand saree.

135
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,823
Look here...l told the weaver
to give me the best, and brought it.

136
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,894
Even Gandhari doesn't have
a saree like this.

137
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:41,396
lf you wear this and come to
the temple on Pongal,

138
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,569
Even if 100 bulls were
assembled there,

139
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,570
Everybody'll be only looking
at your pretty face.

140
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:52,073
Wear this and come soon
lets look at your saree.

141
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,907
Not now...When you come back victorious
in the bull's race.

142
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:59,414
l'll wear this and wait
to meet you. -Yes she's right.

143
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,245
This all... -You don't utter a word.

144
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:05,746
Both of you'll get it from me.
Have bath and eat something.

145
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,261
You said that you'll not say anything
even if you're beheaded.

146
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,863
You've to listen attentively
when l say something.

147
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,200
l said l'll not say anything
even if l am beheaded.

148
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,528
Won't l die if l'm beheaded!
Then how could l say?

149
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,930
Don't show off! You would've
know if l hasn't there.

150
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,941
Brother, where are you going?

151
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:31,950
To get drowned.

152
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,952
Don't talk unnecessary things.

153
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,787
Don't apple polish me.

154
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:36,955
Tell me directly, whatever you want to say.

155
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,789
Yesterday, parrot said that
our wishes'll come true.

156
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:41,459
Which parrot?

157
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,962
That Astrology parrot picked up the
card which said that it'll be fulfilled.

158
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,634
What'll be fulfilled?
- My wish of marrying you.

159
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:53,293
Yes, nowadays events are governed
by astrology?

160
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,307
Oh Parrot...l'll kick &
kill everything.

161
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:57,968
Definitely parrot's words
will come true.

162
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,145
Don't tell Appakalai what the
parrot said.

163
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,648
Even then, he's very angry with you.

164
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,985
He said madam that you, people drank
toddy & picked up a fight at the fair.

165
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:19,828
97...98...99....

166
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,163
99....

167
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,662
100....

168
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:30,339
This punishment is for informing her
that we drank toddy.

169
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,841
Punishment for informing her about the
fight l picked up with the lorry man.

170
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,172
Manickam how many bulls do we've?

171
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,178
We....52...53...55 bulls.

172
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:42,013
For 55 bulls...fetch water from the well
& fill 4 troughs for each bull.

173
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,688
Bathe them before evening.

174
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,515
Then meet me.

175
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,351
What about the punishment for
informing her about the arrival of the police.

176
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,860
l'll tell you the punishment
for that at that time.

177
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:52,530
Come....

178
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,704
Hey Manickam, l'll fix you.

179
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,870
l've found a man to participate
in the cart race, Marimuthu.

180
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,544
He's number cart driver
in the entire market.

181
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:13,882
But, he'll demand more money.
- Money isn't the problem at all.

182
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:16,486
But, l must win the race.

183
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,383
Madam..Don't give importance
to his words

184
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,390
Oh Last Pongal, he boasted
& brought a bull.

185
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,722
After the race, Manickam won.

186
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,731
Whatever it is, our bull didn't
lose to Manickam's bull.

187
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,895
We lost our honour as well as
the bet, 100 acres of land.

188
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:34,231
l'll not allow him inside
if our bull fails this time.

189
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,908
Rajaiah, give him whatever
he requests.

190
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,577
Oh God, he's coming.

191
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:52,921
Why did you come here?

192
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,423
You always come here by having a
bag under your arms.

193
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,425
There're many things here for you to
take and go, aren't they?

194
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,592
Junior Lord'll be having betel
leaves in the box.

195
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,767
Get me a betel leaf.

196
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,762
It's long since l chewed
Thulasi Betel leaves.

197
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,595
My tongue is salivating.

198
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:06,930
Hey, even my tongue is itching.

199
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,107
l'll give you a betel chew it
and quit the place.

200
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:13,608
l'll go only after celebrating Pongal
with junior lord and Yashodama.

201
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:14,278
That's good.

202
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,608
You've decided to stay here for
6 days and eat rich food.

203
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,613
Then, you'll find tobacco
in Jr.Lord's box.

204
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,454
Lime'll be as sweet as honey.

205
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:23,952
Bring even that while
you bring the betel.

206
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,452
l had heard that some
graze cows in other's fields.

207
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:29,127
Now, l've seen it myself.

208
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,625
This isn't your father's
field, right?

209
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:31,625
Hey, if you talk about my father.

210
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:32,793
What'll you do if l talk
about your father?

211
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:33,794
Just say it once again.

212
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,968
Your father is a beggar,
shameless creep.

213
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:39,970
Agreed?- Yes.

214
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:40,968
ls it?- Yes.

215
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:42,970
It's enough, if l know that.

216
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,307
What was the bitter arguments
between father and son?

217
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:50,143
Things are okay.
But he's going bit too far.

218
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,646
What happened?

219
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:56,479
Mother, l've a only sister, right?
He comes here very rarely.

220
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,987
Then, What's the purpose of his
coming here alone without her?

221
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,158
It's very long time since
l've seen her.

222
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,827
That's right, you could've
brought Chinnu with you.

223
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,825
l've also seen her a very
long time ago.

224
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,827
Next week she is having exams, that's why.

225
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,829
Yes, after finishing her exams, she'll...

226
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,160
lf l stay here any further...

227
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:16,835
He said so, out of worries.
You don't take his words serious.

228
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:23,845
Oh God....When l see him bossing here
l really feel very happy.

229
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,517
Working here, in Madambi palace.

230
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,517
ls there any other job more
valuable than this, in the world.

231
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,520
l've experienced it
personally, haven't l?

232
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,358
Those times have gone.

233
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,525
Srikrishnan came here after
selling the palace & the house.

234
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,865
l opposed but he was very
insistant about it.

235
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,192
Can't blame him.

236
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,529
She did injustice to you.

237
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:49,697
Though he's your brother, you brought
him up in the place of mother.

238
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,034
Then could he bear it?

239
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:55,539
A Gandhari...She's not
Gandhari(noble) but Kali (evil).

240
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:56,874
Tell her that Kannaiya.

241
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,878
She still has some soft
corner for them.

242
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,211
They're her husband's
people, aren't they?

243
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,887
You don't talk nonsense.

244
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,885
l don't have soft corner for anybody.

245
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,892
Only your words are
important to me.

246
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:12,054
After us,

247
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,562
Don't we need an heir to take care
of all this?

248
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,565
That's why, l asked you to marry.

249
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,563
Many proposals had come.

250
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:20,568
You refused to marry.

251
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,899
l had asked whether you've
somebody in your mind.

252
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:23,904
You said 'No'.

253
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,909
Kannaiya, do you know how many vows
l had taken for his marriage.

254
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,415
Now l've grown old sister.

255
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,584
It'll be wrong if l talk to you.

256
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,912
Kannaiya, come to the backyard if you
want anything.

257
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,915
Regarding your marriage,

258
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,591
l'll marry...you've someone?

259
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,591
lf you want to marry,
then decide soon.

260
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:45,422
After you lose your pick up then...

261
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,929
What? - l said if you lose your pick up,
nothing will work out.

262
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:48,758
l'll give you a blow.

263
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:53,593
Did you see? Mani got me
this to wear on Pongal.

264
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:57,600
Do you know how since when he
is going to the fair?

265
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,936
20 years.

266
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:05,443
All these years, l go to the temple,
wearing the dress he gets me for pongal.

267
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,619
l've kept them safely.

268
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,281
l kept him here when he was 4.

269
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:17,951
Even l feel jealous of the love
you've for him.

270
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,963
l'm worried only about Sri Krishna.

271
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,625
He lives for me, not for his own self.

272
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,631
He's involved in all of his tricks.

273
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,969
He can't advise him
even for good things.

274
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:36,307
Hey girl....after Kannaiya finishes eating
wash these vessels too.

275
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,422
Chinnamma, do you've
anything to say?

276
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:54,223
l'm telling you truth.
This is my child.

277
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,931
Other than him, l haven't had
any sex with my other man.

278
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,939
Even he's right when he asks.

279
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,938
You and your husband have dark
complexions.

280
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,770
How did you deliver a
fair baby?

281
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,275
What do you think?

282
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:12,779
Your decision is our decision.
- l'll decide.

283
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:17,285
We the panchayat believe that
she's lying.

284
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:22,791
She's making her husband responsible
for the child fathered by someone.

285
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:27,955
We've to shave her head,make her sit
on a donkey & hit her.

286
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,794
And take her around
the village.

287
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,299
This is the decision of the panchayat.

288
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,470
l've not committed any aduItery.

289
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,034
Has any one got to say
anything about this.

290
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,201
May any one got any objections?

291
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,510
Yes, l do have.

292
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:49,144
Without knowing the truth,
you mustn't punish this girl.

293
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,485
What do you mean?

294
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,988
l mean that you can't punish tell her
crime is proved. - Yes.

295
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,152
Panchayat has gathered here.

296
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,991
To know how did they beget a fair
child when both of them are dark.

297
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,658
Madam Gandhari has currently judged
that Chemana is at fauIt.

298
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,837
Can you prove it's wrong?

299
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:06,834
lf l do....

300
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,499
lf you do...then from tomorrow onwards
you be the chieftain.

301
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,836
Or else you'll be taken on the donkey
with a shaved head.

302
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,676
Agreed? - Yes.

303
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,518
Hey Kitappa, come here.

304
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:38,192
Have it...- No need.

305
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,370
Have it.

306
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,707
For last 20 years, he didn't know that
she had an affair with somebody, right?

307
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:54,216
Nobody in this tiny village have a
different opinion about Chinnama.

308
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:54,885
Do you?

309
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,049
Okay, only on the premises
that black & black can not be white,

310
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,384
You've accused her.

311
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,388
But, l'll not let you accuse her
under those premises.

312
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,724
What was the colour of the betel leaf
l gave him?

313
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:12,567
Green right?...and the
lime's colour was white.

314
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,233
lf he doesn't spit out any
one of those colours,

315
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,238
l'll bash him up to pulp.

316
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,570
Spit man...spit.

317
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,925
Babies will be of fair
or dark complexion.

318
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,591
Suspecting your wife by listening
to other's...

319
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,927
Take the baby and go home.

320
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,432
You've saved my honour sir.

321
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,766
You didn't tell me whether l've to sit
in your place or on the donkey.

322
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,205
l've relinquished my chieftain's post.

323
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,010
Hereafter, Srikrishnan
will be chieftain.

324
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,308
Stop...Stop please.

325
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,812
Enough. -Stop.

326
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,987
lf Injimuda people win this race
what'll Madambi people give?

327
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:44,652
101 acres of land...101
bullock carts, 101 cows.

328
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,490
What'll Injimuda people give
if they lose?

329
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:53,164
202 acres of land...202 bullock carts
....202 cows....

330
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,170
Okay then lets begin.
- yes lets begin.

331
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:57,500
Start.

332
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,239
Hey come.

333
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,099
Bunch of special bananas: 50.

334
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,829
Bunch of young coconuts: 60.

335
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,872
Bunch of coconuts: 400.

336
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,441
Then what about the mango peel?
- No...coconuts: 450.

337
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,605
Delivered all these items
in Velu's place.

338
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,440
Okay you take the cart and go.

339
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,120
lf you go there & talk any
nonsense to Yashodama.

340
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,353
l'll chop you. -Go...

341
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,797
Oh, sister-in-law is coming.

342
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,128
Hey shut up, man.

343
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,301
l've warned you several times
not to talk about her.

344
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,740
Enough of counting....
Give the money.

345
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,750
Boss....This time you didn't deliver
any items to my shop.

346
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,249
Groundnuts, dry coconut & something else
That's your business, right?

347
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:31,159
But no use bargaining the price...
Don't expect anything.

348
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,657
You always think about money.

349
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,392
Have you heard this song
Manicka?- Which song?

350
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:45,439
Everybody says that you're a
stone hearted person.

351
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:56,685
Kathu sister, he's not a
stone hearted man.

352
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,356
He got into this mess.

353
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:03,520
l don't think he'll marry
anybody in this birth.

354
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,261
Then l'll also not marry.

355
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,359
He has loved me for 10 yrs.

356
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:13,596
l know, that he'll marry only me
if he wants to marry.

357
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:18,203
That's why, l still wait for him,
not whole heartedly.

358
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,977
But now he has only
one aim in his life.

359
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:25,138
To subjugate that Injimuda Gandhari.
You yourself say.

360
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,377
The injustice which Gandhari did
to Yasodhama & him, was it fair?

361
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:35,052
She got her brother married to Yashodama
without revealing that he's mad.

362
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,158
She delivered a baby.

363
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,886
And that mad fellow jumped into the
well and died with that baby.

364
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:39,722
We didn't get even the corpses.

365
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,399
Would the corpses be found if he didn't
marry me?- l didn't mean that.

366
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:46,901
After that incident Gandhari threw
Yashodama out of the house.

367
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,231
Didn't give her the properties too.

368
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,237
That till he subjugates Gandhari,
he'll not lead a family life,

369
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,570
He has taken an Oath.

370
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,178
What else can l call it except
''my bad luck''.

371
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,412
Okay, aren't you marrying anybody?

372
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,346
Don't l've to get a girl
according to my taste?

373
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,749
Leave that oldy...l'm ready.

374
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:08,248
l'll give you a blow. His mischief...
l'll fix you later, just watch.

375
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:18,603
We're deceived.

376
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,100
Private buses have gone
on strike suddenly.

377
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,102
Oh God! What'll we do with
this girl and him?

378
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,771
Can you accommodate them in your
house for the time being?

379
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,772
My father is angry with me
for staging a drama.

380
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,945
lf l make the artistes also
stay there, heavens will fall.

381
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:31,779
Why isn't the bus not
to be seen?

382
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,280
Bus people have gone on
strike suddenly.

383
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,782
How could he say like this?

384
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,713
We've promised to reach Meenakshipuram
tomorrow to stage a drama.

385
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,287
What can we do if
bus people strike?

386
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:43,450
What'll we do if you talk like that?
We came for your drama.

387
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:47,621
It's your responsibility to send us
back. Call a taxi man.

388
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,791
Oh God!...That'll cost a fortune.
We can't afford it.

389
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:55,970
Don't play the fool with me.
You'll be in a soup.

390
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,972
Brother, don't shout
we're known here.

391
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,644
Then call a taxi man.

392
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,473
l'll think about some way.
- Then do it.

393
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,491
By the time you bring the party
l'll have toddy and come.

394
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,819
Having toddy isn't the problem.

395
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,155
But you'll not find me
if you create trouble.

396
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,161
l've stopped getting beatings, now.

397
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,664
No...l'll not create any problems.
You go and come back.

398
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,503
lf we leave before dusk we'll
reach there day after in the wee hours.

399
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,667
Why do you carry a stick?
- Dogs are troubling.

400
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:31,842
Last time, they chased me a lot.

401
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,510
Brother, shall we put
you in this cart?

402
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:41,118
l'll not get into the cart.

403
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:42,851
You call a taxi, man.

404
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,784
Uncle, lets leave this place somehow.

405
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,518
You be quiet, they can't play
the fool with me. Call the taxi.

406
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:54,028
Lets take toddy and go. -What?

407
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,199
Lets take toddy and....

408
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,546
Load 5-6 bags of paddy
in the vehicle.

409
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,553
Brother, she's the one.

410
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,722
What's your name?

411
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,559
You'll reach Meenakshipuram at dawn.

412
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,389
He agreed just because l said that
l'll give the bus fare.

413
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:26,893
Where's my uncle?

414
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,894
He'll come back now.
He has also agreed.

415
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,564
Okay, take out the money.

416
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,902
You sit in that cart. -Have it.

417
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:36,899
Come...

418
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,850
Not that...l don't know
who you're.

419
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,424
Karthumbi.- Who Karithupi
(spit)on you?

420
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,655
Nobody spit on me.
l said my name is Karthumbi.

421
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:01,923
l don't want to know your place
or name.

422
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,931
Why're you sitting inside the cart?
- l was told to sit inside.

423
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,763
By whom?- An oldy.

424
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,767
No oldy is authorised to make you sit
in the cart. Get down you girl.

425
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,268
Then why did he take the money?
- Who?

426
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,779
An uncle....- Which uncle?

427
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,775
l don't know, you find out
...He's in that shop.

428
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:18,615
Shop?

429
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:24,054
He's coming...Ask him
whatever you want to...

430
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,122
What? - Uncle, he's talking nonsense.

431
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,954
You dog, are you using
fiIthy words with a girl?

432
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,288
Better talk respectfully
or l'll kick you.

433
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,965
Did he take money from you?
- Oh God..Uncle didn't take money.

434
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,134
You said uncle took. Who's he?
- He's my uncle.

435
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,131
You said that he didn't
take the money.

436
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,395
It's true that l said uncle
took money from me, but...

437
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,131
When did l take the money
from you?

438
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,571
Oh God! l didn't say that you took
money. - She said that you took money.

439
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:48,644
l didn't tell you that my uncle took
money. -Then which uncle took money?

440
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,315
Hey liar, you're lying?
- lf you call me a liar...

441
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,484
Then do l've to call a liar,
a truthful person?

442
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,649
Whatever l told you is true.

443
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,315
He's my uncle. Another
uncle took money from me.

444
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,822
l got into the cart only after
he told me that this's his cart.

445
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,653
Okay leave that...Who're you
to ask all this?

446
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,590
Who am l?

447
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:08,892
lf you don't know who you're...
then ask me who you're.

448
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,668
l'll tell you who you're. - Uncle.

449
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,502
Ask me whether l know me.

450
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,835
That time l'll tell you
who you're and who l'm.

451
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,671
Uncle...Don't talk nonsense
after drinking Toddy.

452
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,507
It's my fauIt to have come with you.

453
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,577
What's the confusion there?

454
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,676
There..he's the one who took
money from them. Ask him...

455
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,684
What?

456
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,017
You had asked me to sit only after
taking money from me, right?- Yes.

457
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,452
Then why does this creep shout at me?
- Hey mind your words.

458
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,860
Can you only talk nonsense to
the girls whom you meet on the way?

459
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:45,195
You both don't fight. They're stranded
on the road due to the strike.

460
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:49,464
Since cart was going empty, l asked them
to get in by way of help.

461
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:50,538
Brother, you give me that money.
- Which money?

462
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,709
Give me the money they gave you.

463
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,137
Take back your money...Take away your
baggages. This cart'll not go.

464
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:56,278
l don't want the money back.

465
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,708
Give it back to the one
who took it from me.

466
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,209
We'll go only by this cart.

467
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,721
lf you hadn't taken the money
they would've dropped us.

468
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,886
They said that they would call
the taxi. - Uncle be quiet.

469
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:09,393
Come here.

470
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,391
Think that l've committed a mistake.

471
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,830
Poor fellows. We didn't
lose anything.

472
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,396
l've taken four times of
the bus fare.

473
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,573
Atleast we'll use that amount
during our journey.

474
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,072
Whatever it's, Bulls will pull
the cart.

475
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,507
They'll pull even 2 extra members,
what's our problem, please agree.

476
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,238
l know that you'll create a problem as
soon as you drink.

477
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,246
l didn't pick up a fight, right?
- But that was better than this.

478
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,248
You got me scoldings
from a girl.

479
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,585
You come and get into the cart.

480
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,286
Go, you dog.

481
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,133
Hey call the taxi.

482
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,638
Ask him to sleep quietly.

483
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,642
He's sleeping.

484
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,312
l think, he's from a
pedigreed family.

485
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,984
Very good cuIture!

486
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,649
You go idiot.

487
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,819
This will not work.
l'll make them get down.

488
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,917
What can l do if he blabbers
in sleep?

489
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:53,327
You thief pig's mother's sister's, wife's son!

490
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,495
Why did you stop?

491
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,497
Hey, l'll perform your
last rites today.

492
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,335
His grandmother's.... -Uncle.

493
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,269
No problem if we don't take him.

494
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:06,667
He blabbers in his sleep.

495
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,503
He's not blabbering in sleep...
Both of them are enacting a drama.

496
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,683
We'll be rebuked till dawn
if we leave him like this.

497
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,843
Come here man.
- l'll bury him alive.

498
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,522
ls he mad?

499
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,517
ls he picking up a fight with the
person who's sleeping?- Shut up.

500
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,286
Oh God! This has become a big nuisance.
Picking up a fight at midnight?

501
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:27,521
Whatever it is, we've taken the
responsibility. We've to adjust, you get in.

502
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,790
l'll tell you one thing.

503
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,868
lf he says anything more, l'll pierce
something in his mouth.

504
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,531
l'll put both of them down
when l see a light.

505
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,699
lf they agree, l'll take the cart or
you come by walk. - Agreed, you get in.

506
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:44,370
Who's that... - Your father, bloody
creep, beggar, nasty fellow.

507
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:15,073
Brother, sit on his face...
if l see his face...Both are....

508
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,414
Hey go...

509
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,824
No noise? Both of them
be ready to get down.

510
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:07,850
Prepare 2 strong teas.

511
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,787
Hasn't brother come?- He has come.
He needn't have tea...He's in full booze.

512
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,540
2 troublesome persons have got
into the cart on the way.

513
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,708
l'm going to put them
down here.

514
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,204
Let them be here till dawn.

515
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,879
Then they'll go by some
vehicle tomorrow.

516
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:31,878
Get down.

517
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,060
Hey, we should behave like
humans, shouldn't we?

518
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:56,571
Leaving a young girl and an old drunkard
on the way at midnight...

519
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:57,900
What about their misbehaviour?

520
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,407
Getting offended by that
old drunkard's words..

521
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,070
What'll that poor girl do? - Oh God!
she's not poor...She's a chatter box.

522
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:11,854
Couldn't you forgive her because
she said something offensive?

523
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:14,422
Even if you try to convince me...
-You don't say anything further.

524
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:21,597
lf your sister Chinnu faces similar
situation, will you bear it?

525
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,925
That's why, l said that they'll
not create any trouble.

526
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,605
We'll reach Meenakshipuram at dawn.

527
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,934
You don't take oldy howls seriously
till we reach.

528
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,435
What? Go and have it and come.

529
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:48,224
Then....

530
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:51,961
l....

531
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,792
Shall l ask you something?

532
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:58,635
What's it?

533
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,303
Do you like to have Bun?

534
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,644
What?- Bun?

535
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,815
l don't want...l feel sleepy.

536
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,983
You sleep as soon as
the cart moves.

537
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:55,144
Water inside(toddy)
as well as outside.

538
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:10,994
It's me Srikrishnan, standing
behind the bullock cart.

539
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,003
Shall l ask you something?

540
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:15,433
Nobody will see or hear us.

541
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,668
l'll not get such a good
chance hereafter.

542
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:19,668
That's why....

543
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,671
Please go ahead.

544
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,672
Do you like me, Thumbi?

545
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,019
Oh God, why did you ask
me that?

546
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:35,022
As you think, l'm not so old.
l've not yet married also.

547
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:39,025
Till now, l've not even thought
about a girl.

548
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:45,191
For the first time, l thought about
a girl as soon as l saw you.

549
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,200
l want to know your mind, right?

550
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,035
Don't you like me?

551
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,203
Why're you silent?

552
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,478
You must be feeling shy, right?

553
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,045
Say it openly if you
don't like me.

554
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:04,046
l'm asking you directly because l'm
not used to this.

555
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,887
Oh God, what am l to say?

556
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:11,721
Don't say yes, even if you like me.

557
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,954
l'll take your silence
as acceptance.

558
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:16,896
Shall l?

559
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,141
Don't mistake me.

560
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:31,145
l considered you as
my own brother.

561
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,246
Like my sibling.

562
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:36,419
l was afraid that you'll put me down
from the cart yesterday,

563
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:38,353
So l kept quiet.

564
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:42,251
lf l've done any mistake...
forgive me.

565
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,757
Don't have any bad intentions
about me.

566
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:48,257
Since l've told you all this,
don't get angry.

567
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:50,031
Hereafter, smile at me
whenever you look.

568
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:53,262
Only then, l'll be sure that you've
understood me.

569
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:57,702
Don't stand here anymore.
People'll mistake you. Go...

570
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:14,624
l think they have come.

571
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:24,300
For drama.... -Yes.

572
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:26,302
We were very upset.

573
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:29,370
What to do? Bus people went on
a strike suddenly.

574
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,636
Anyway you people have reached, right?

575
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:32,301
6 'o' clock is the drama.

576
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:34,310
There's time for one rehearsal.

577
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:35,804
It's over.

578
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:37,980
Okay, then shall we take leave?

579
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:39,808
Come....

580
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,247
Shall l take leave,
Srikrishna brother?

581
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:45,378
Don't know when we'll meet again.

582
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,381
We'll meet....We've to meet.

583
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:50,827
Our journey is via this way, right?

584
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:52,162
How's it impossible for
us to meet then?

585
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:55,661
Okay, lets go.

586
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:59,928
Every dog has it's own day.

587
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,000
It's like this.

588
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:04,003
Did you see the power of bullock cart,
when there were no buses?

589
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,335
They think as if they're
flying an aeroplane.

590
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:21,357
Lets go.

591
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:25,520
Lets go.

592
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:33,101
Okay, my stomach is upset...
l'll drink soda & come back.

593
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:40,540
Oh...Have the artistes arrived?
- Yes, they arrived just now.

594
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:47,445
You put us in lot of tension.
Forget about the club.

595
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,783
l would've been disgraced, if the drama
hadn't been staged.

596
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,787
lf l, Jr.Boss had invested
something and if it goes in vain....

597
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:59,229
Her father, right?
- No, her uncle.

598
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,557
Don't we've to get together
this evening, uncle?

599
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:05,667
Yes, sure....Will anyone
oppose you Jr.boss?

600
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:08,468
You go...l'll come.

601
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:16,576
Brother, l'll fetch water & come.

602
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:21,918
Give me a pack of cigarette.

603
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:24,253
Party is superb, man....

604
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:27,249
Only now the money which l had invested
in the drama has yielded profits.

605
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:30,760
Uncle looks as if he'll take 5-6
bottles of liquor.

606
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:34,430
Okay leave that, will
it work, man?

607
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,496
Why ask?

608
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,595
She doesn't seem like opposing us.

609
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:44,429
Whatever its, l shouldn't
miss her.

610
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:48,176
Do as l say, come.

611
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:05,193
l feel difficuIt to breathe..
l feel giddy.

612
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:06,458
Earlier you said that
your stomach is upset.

613
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:08,392
True, that has caused this.

614
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:09,863
l'll become alright,
if l lie down somewhere.

615
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:11,964
You lie down in the cart...
l'll drive.

616
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:16,294
No...l'll not be able to sleep
properly due to the shakes.

617
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,865
Earlier, Didn't you sleep in the
cart nicely?

618
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:21,868
That was when l didn't
have body pain.

619
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:23,543
Body pain?

620
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:26,812
Head & stomach etc...
are the part of the body.

621
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:28,484
Okay, you lie down in the cart.
We'll go in the afternoon.

622
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:29,310
No...That's....

623
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:32,814
Have you been to Meenakshipuram
temple here?

624
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:34,490
No...l've not...
- Very famous temple.

625
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:36,318
l had taken a vow. - Vow?

626
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,159
5-6 yrs back, because of perpetual
headache, l had taken a vow,

627
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:41,490
To worship Goddess by
lighting the camphor.

628
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:44,166
You don't do that now
with this body pain.

629
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:44,834
Lets go later and perform it.

630
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:46,161
Aren't we coming here every month?

631
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,503
Like postponing Lord Ganapathy's
marriage,

632
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:53,676
Worshiping of Goddess is
also getting postponed.

633
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:55,174
Needn't postpone it even now.

634
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:57,677
That Goddess might've reminded me
of my vow by giving me pain.

635
00:46:58,215 --> 00:46:59,512
She's very powerful, our prayers
will be answered immediately.

636
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:00,580
Don't test her.

637
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:02,909
Whatever it's, lets perform it.
l've decided.

638
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:04,577
Oh Goddess Bagavathi!

639
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:13,927
Good.

640
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:15,922
Oh Goddess.

641
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:22,698
You've fulfilled your
vow, right?

642
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:24,703
We'll reach by noon if
we start now, lets go....

643
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:25,541
Lets go.

644
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:28,207
Do you want Cutlet?
- No need, lets go.

645
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:31,706
Shall we go?- Have you seen dramas?

646
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:33,044
l've seen in my childhood.

647
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:36,047
Nowadays, dramas aren't like that.
It's full of modern technic.

648
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:37,880
Even l had watched them long back.

649
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:40,215
Today l've to watch their
technic. Thief.

650
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:46,554
Stop....No need of dramas etc...
Lets go brother.

651
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:51,401
What has happened to you?

652
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:54,570
Hey... from fields to business and
from business to fields.

653
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:56,568
From fair to house....
and from house to fair.

654
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:58,570
Drinking liquor, getting beaten up...
Falling down unconscious.

655
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:00,242
These were the routine.

656
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:01,570
There should be some
change inbetween them.

657
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:05,578
Today, l've decided
to watch the drama.

658
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:33,273
l feel shy....l feel shy....

659
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:41,441
By plucking the feathers,
my lover came this way.

660
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:45,838
Haven't you entered my heart as
a deer and taken an abode?

661
00:49:56,727 --> 00:50:10,198
Aren't you exhilarating my heart
by entering it as a song?

662
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:13,869
You're the one...who searches this
blushing flower, aren't you?

663
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:21,048
Aren't you the coral thumbi?(black beetle).

664
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,599
When l play Veena on your body,

665
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:17,262
And sing songs, my desires
will become passionate.

666
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:41,622
Oh my life don't go....
Aren't you the Lord Indra?

667
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:45,293
Aren't you the smiling flower
....the chilIness?

668
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:24,171
Uncle...Boss....

669
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:39,516
Boss...in your feet...lies the heaven.

670
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:45,628
You say that 2 lives are
starving.- Yes.

671
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,271
What's this? Don't you know
this is the dressing room?

672
00:52:56,706 --> 00:53:00,506
l know....Don't change in a hurry.

673
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:03,175
Let the next scene
begin slowly.

674
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,845
Here in Meenakshipuram, things move
as per my convenience.

675
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,017
Will you please go out or not?

676
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:09,014
How can l?

677
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:13,689
l'm not performing dramas,
dance etc to enjoy the show.

678
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:16,685
But girls like you
fall in my trap.

679
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:18,360
Tell me if you want any money.

680
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:20,256
Don't create unnecessary scenes.

681
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:22,894
l'll shout if you don't go.

682
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:25,861
These are the drama dialogues,
aren't they?

683
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:29,134
Don't increase the demand, right?
You come.

684
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:30,039
Leave her.

685
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:33,867
You go from here...No need of
drama or dance here.

686
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:35,374
Are you misbehaving?

687
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:39,942
Are you from this place?
- Why do you need to know that?

688
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:51,786
Leave him.

689
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:05,804
Don't hit him. Leave him.
-Inside this..

690
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:10,302
Don't hit him.

691
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,499
Thief.... - Don't leave him, catch...

692
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:49,344
Hey, is there anybody else?

693
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:55,519
Move...

694
00:54:57,994 --> 00:55:00,019
Where's brother?- All of them
have got in...Come lets go.

695
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:21,268
Mother, which place is this?

696
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:23,208
Mother.

697
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,448
Which is the way to Srihalli?

698
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:31,614
Mother, won't you talk?
Which is the way to Srihalli?

699
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:32,783
Mother.

700
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:39,462
Look at the way princess is sleeping!
Hey, get up...

701
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,464
Don't know which idiot's face
l saw and left this morning.

702
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:49,130
Look she's sleeping cooly after
creating all this ruckus.

703
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:51,636
Oh God...Where's brother?

704
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:53,305
Brother....

705
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,974
Hey, l'm asking you only
where's brother?

706
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:58,813
l don't know. You said that
everybody had got in.

707
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:01,643
l don't remember.
- Were you drunk,

708
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:05,647
That you don't remember?
Oh God, they may kill my brother.

709
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:09,484
lf anything happens to him, l swear
on God.. l'll see your end.

710
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:10,989
What am l to do if he
didn't get in?

711
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:12,491
Get down and stand upside down.

712
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:15,823
Yes, l'm mad to stand upside
down in this forest.

713
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:17,829
So you know it's the forest?
- Why did we come here?

714
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:22,668
Have we come here? When they chased
us in the dark,

715
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:24,499
Did your father run in the front,

716
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:25,674
To show us the way?

717
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:29,541
Can't he talk decently?

718
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:32,681
l can't. You dancer...You...

719
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:36,510
lf you act too much, l'll rebuke
you in bad words.

720
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:40,912
ldiot, are you teaching me decency
after doing all the harm to me?

721
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:44,193
It'll not work if l talk to him.
You don't talk to me hereafter.

722
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:47,522
That's fine! l'm not leaving you in the
forest because you're a girl.

723
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:49,861
l'll drop you when l find a road.

724
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:54,863
l'll break your teeth if you
talk till then...go...Bulls, move...

725
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:56,867
Hell with you.

726
00:57:58,174 --> 00:58:00,039
ls there any necessity for you
to run through the forest?

727
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:02,044
How many times you've
been to the fair?

728
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:04,873
Don't you know the way yet?
That's why you're called as bull.

729
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:08,543
Animals should've some sense.

730
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:30,869
Which is the way to Srihalli?

731
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:35,042
What are you talking man?

732
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:41,872
No...Do you know malayalam?

733
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:43,882
We don't know.

734
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:46,555
Please listen to what
l say attentively.

735
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,555
Bullock cart...l...

736
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:53,889
By mistake we came here
through the forest. Understood?

737
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:56,728
l'm saved.

738
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:59,731
Hereafter listen to what
l say attentively.

739
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:03,401
Srihalli. -Yes Halli.

740
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,534
We want to go there.

741
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:11,406
Angalu... -Oh Angalu...?

742
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:13,582
We want to go there.

743
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:18,579
Polallam!(Go) Angalu Polallam
(Want to go there).

744
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:22,087
Angalu Polallam.

745
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:23,589
Yes, that's it.

746
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:27,422
Now got the technique.
Angallu Polallam!

747
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:30,758
lf l add (La) to everything...
Then it becomes their language.

748
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:37,937
Srihalli...Pollalam...Vali (motion).

749
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:40,276
Vazhi (way...)

750
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:49,946
Which is the way
to go to Srihalli?

751
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:55,287
l don't know, he seems to be a crack.
- This isn't Telugu or Kannada.

752
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:57,518
May be this language was born
before the world was created.

753
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:01,463
That's right.

754
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:02,961
Don't sit in the way, mother.

755
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,627
She's...

756
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:10,806
Oruchalla...(one tea).

757
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:11,803
Chaiah...(tea).

758
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:22,480
Alli ondha (one) -Yes...

759
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:35,494
She'll pay separately for her tea.
l'll not pay.

760
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:53,345
Hey...You...For a tea...

761
01:00:56,619 --> 01:00:58,177
How far is Srihalli from here?

762
01:00:58,388 --> 01:00:59,355
A day's journey.

763
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:04,022
A day's journey, right? -Yes.

764
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:07,523
How did she know?.

765
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:15,370
Are you the tribal? That's why you've
the monkey's character.

766
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:18,369
Don't talk to me. -lf you tell
me not to talk...

767
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:20,872
l don't understand what these
people are talking.

768
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:23,204
Don't we've to know the way
to go back to our place?

769
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:26,041
Let's go by the way we know.
Let's reach when we can reach.

770
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:27,876
l don't want to reach there
immediately.

771
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:30,552
You'll not...You don't have any house
nor anything. You're set free.

772
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:37,582
We're told not to talk.- Then return the
amount which l paid for your tea.

773
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,557
l didn't ask you for tea.

774
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:41,229
Why did you drink
when he gave you?

775
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:43,228
He gave me and l drank,
that's all.

776
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:45,560
Don't quarrel with me unnecessarily.

777
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:56,901
Then...No use, if we quarrel like this.

778
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:00,745
Forgive me if l have hurt you.

779
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:03,578
Karthumbi, ask for the way.

780
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,087
lf you want, l'll
drop you home.

781
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:14,090
Not necessary. - Then?

782
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:17,095
l'll ask for the way but...

783
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:20,868
But... -You've to
do something for me.

784
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:22,669
Ask whatever you want.

785
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:26,866
l.....Muthu Gavuu (Kiss me).

786
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:28,534
What's that?

787
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:30,872
Muthu gavuu.

788
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:44,884
Oh god...It wouldn't be that.

789
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,732
Did you ask? - Yes there's way.

790
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:56,632
But we can leave only after 2 days.
- Why?

791
01:02:57,006 --> 01:02:59,975
It seems rain water has flooded
the river and the way is blocked.

792
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:02,701
River? l didn't see
any river here.

793
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,481
It seems they don't know the way.

794
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:07,546
How do these people know that water
has flooded the river?

795
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:10,546
It seems the tribals who had gone
to the fair with honey, haven't returned.

796
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,548
They are staying on the other side.
Our state is on that side.

797
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:14,550
This is Mysore.

798
01:03:14,757 --> 01:03:19,626
Oh God...Let my enemies also
not face this plight.

799
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:23,565
They're warning us to move
somewhere from here -Why?

800
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,992
Because after dusk wild elephants'll
be roaming here -Elephants!

801
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:31,165
But it seems elephants will not come
near us, if they see the fire.

802
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,715
Hey what're you thinking?

803
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:51,291
l'm thinking whether your grandmother'll
get a good husband.

804
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:52,461
Did you get it?

805
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,458
Oh God!..It's enough
if l can pass that way.

806
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:57,530
Oh God! Wild Elephant!

807
01:03:58,334 --> 01:03:59,961
Everything will end if
Elephants stamp us.

808
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,797
According to my predictions,
if a week passes.

809
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,973
Not only the elephants even their
young ones wouldn't come.

810
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:08,310
l'm unable to see
because of starvation.

811
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,313
lf you get something from the
shop tomorrow.

812
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:12,572
l'll prepare something
and give you.

813
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,245
But...One thing.

814
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:18,112
Neku Muthu gavuu.

815
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:20,455
What?

816
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:21,613
Muthu gavu.

817
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:24,387
lf you've anything to say.
say if directly.

818
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,628
l'm hearing this for a very long time.
Are you taunting me?

819
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:30,128
Muthu gavu! l'm telling you, l can
understand everything.

820
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:46,411
Evalu dey Akkaraileh.

821
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:48,678
Give me cela.

822
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:50,248
Give me that cela(bag)

823
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:53,919
Give...Only for that.

824
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:58,587
Only such language will be found
here in this world.

825
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:02,764
How did she know this?
Muthu gavu!

826
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:07,265
She's playing the fool with me.

827
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:08,763
Let's ask him.

828
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,766
3 muthu gavu! -Go man.

829
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:18,939
Are you asking me!
l'll hit you. go man.

830
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:32,690
Mother..why don't l ask her?

831
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:36,965
Muthu gavu.

832
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:41,865
What? What did you say?
what're you asking?

833
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:44,731
l'll chop you into pieces.
-No...Don't chop me, l'll die.

834
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,806
How dare you talk like this after
coming to our place?

835
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:48,806
Come here again,l'll show yu
what'll l do to you.

836
01:05:59,021 --> 01:05:59,988
Muthu gavu.

837
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:02,151
Muthu gavu.

838
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:48,201
Gowri, bring some water.

839
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,705
l'll finish with household
work and bring water.

840
01:06:58,247 --> 01:07:05,949
Give me just one, muthu gavu.
-No...Leave me.

841
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:10,051
l feel shy. -Hey get up.

842
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:20,565
Brother untie me.

843
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,738
Oh my god -Untie me.

844
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:27,071
Oh my god.

845
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:29,907
What happened?

846
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:36,817
He was peeping into the bed room
of a newly married couple.

847
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:40,585
For the past few days money thefts are
being reported here. - Oh God!

848
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:43,254
Hey untie me.

849
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:44,585
l'll hand over him
to the police.

850
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:46,921
Please forgive him if he has done
anything wrong.

851
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:48,763
He's a nasty fellow.

852
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:52,764
l'm an oldie...He's talking
fiIthily to me?

853
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:55,129
He had come to my shop
& talked bad words.

854
01:07:59,675 --> 01:08:00,642
Aren't you ashamed man?

855
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:01,969
What all the nasty things have
you done?

856
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:04,976
That's mother didn't understand
what l said.

857
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:06,814
It's because that she didn't
understand me.

858
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:10,152
You were tied here because you peeped
into the bedroom of husband & wife.

859
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:12,316
You had insuIted that lady
and that shop keeper.

860
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:15,649
They said that you're also involved in
the robberies which're taking place here.

861
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:16,658
Me?

862
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:19,756
Persons have gone to town to
call the police.

863
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:22,324
Have you heard about
Mallikattu policeman.

864
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:24,992
Nobody'll question him even if
he beats and kill you.

865
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:31,332
Such a nasty person will come here
and blemish,

866
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:33,906
The name of we malayalees who
work and earn pennies.

867
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:42,180
Please save my husband.

868
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:44,451
l'll leave this place with him.

869
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:47,351
Please save my husband.

870
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:54,419
What mother? - Hey it seems he's
her husband.

871
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:56,031
Lets pardon him and free him.

872
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:58,197
They'll leave this place.

873
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:00,259
There's he's coming.

874
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,530
Never step into these jungle again.
Be careful! Go...

875
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:05,532
What is he saying?

876
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:08,877
It seems he's leaving you because your
wife cried and pleaded - Who?

877
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:11,538
Leave the place immediately.

878
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:13,874
He says that you shouldn't be
seen in this forest.

879
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:14,879
lf you don't want to spoil
your heaIth.

880
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:16,642
Fall at his feet and seek
his pardon.

881
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:18,547
How can l do it when my
hands are tied?

882
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:21,052
lf mappu(pardon) means dirty meaning
also in their language,

883
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:22,884
l'll have to undergo another
punishment for that.

884
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:25,390
It'll be enough, if you
say Lellu Allu

885
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:27,721
What?- Lellu Allu.

886
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:31,198
Lellu Allu....
Please untie me.

887
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:45,180
Oh God...l feel ashamed
when l think of that.

888
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:47,115
Inspite of roaming with the
dirty creep,

889
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:50,417
l saved my honour only because of my
good deeds accumulated in the last birth.

890
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,818
Peeping into somebody's bedroom,

891
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:57,522
Yuck...Only dirty creeps
will do such things.

892
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:02,727
His honourable appearance is
a deception to his rogueness.

893
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,568
Oh my Goddess, how to read
the mind of humans?

894
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:11,069
Stop it...lf you want to read them,
then enter into my mouth.

895
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:14,242
Don't act too much, you'll fall...

896
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:34,422
She's packing something.

897
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:04,125
Muthu gavu.

898
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:06,457
Muthu Gavu!(Kiss me).

899
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,127
Muthu Gavu!(kiss me).

900
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:27,542
Somebody catch us...Water....

901
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:32,205
Oh God!

902
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:32,099
How many times have l warned
you not to tease me?

903
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:34,108
You teased me again.

904
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:40,145
l faced many problems because l went to
find out what was that.

905
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:45,646
l was slapped by an old lady, tribals
tied me & l lost my honour.

906
01:13:45,988 --> 01:13:47,956
You had even teased me
for that also.

907
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:50,290
Only when l came to
know its meaning,

908
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:55,623
Anger, sorrows, shame which l had
internalized till then, have externalised.

909
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:58,290
l didn't do it wantonly.

910
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:01,801
l never expected that
it'll happen like this.

911
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:05,636
Had l known how to seek your pardon...
- Not necessary.

912
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:07,437
It's my fauIt also.

913
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:11,338
l lied to you that rain water
had flooded the river.

914
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:16,815
When l got angry with you, l planned
to torture you for 2 days.

915
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:20,483
Even l didn't expect that
it'll happen like this.

916
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:25,490
Karthumbi, when you go home...

917
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:33,828
No, earlier you had said,
''l don't have house nor anything''

918
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:40,998
Then... - l had only
an elder sister.

919
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:45,341
Didn't tribals tell you
about 'Mallikathu'.

920
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:49,180
He's my sister's husband,
he's a Police Officer in Mysore.

921
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:56,684
He's No.1 rowdy as well
as the Policeman.

922
01:14:57,326 --> 01:15:00,523
People will tremble
if they see his shadow.

923
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:05,522
l saw him killing my sister,

924
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:09,863
And hanging her body
to the beam.

925
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,037
Then, he filed a false case saying that
she hanged herself to death.

926
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:15,373
Who could question him?

927
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:19,545
There's a gossip in the village that
only to marry me he killed my sister.

928
01:15:20,749 --> 01:15:25,049
l came out from my house for drama etc.,
to escape from him.

929
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:29,057
The one who was with me
wasn't my uncle.

930
01:15:29,491 --> 01:15:31,550
But Mallukathu's distant relative.

931
01:15:34,763 --> 01:15:37,891
l don't have any
animus towards you.

932
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:40,561
To tell the truth,

933
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:44,567
l found the tiff with you
very delightful.

934
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:46,233
When l got the sense
of understanding,

935
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:50,571
l didn't admire such days
even in my childhood,

936
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:52,080
And those days will not
come again also.

937
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:56,581
l've only one thing to
tell you, Manickam.

938
01:15:57,185 --> 01:15:57,913
Thanks.

939
01:15:59,187 --> 01:16:06,389
For quarelling, saving, buying tea
for me and making me cry.

940
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:08,263
Thanks for everything.

941
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:45,327
On the other side of the rice field,
is my house.

942
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:46,133
What?

943
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:48,499
l said on the other side of the
rice field, is my house.

944
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:51,967
l want to ask you something.

945
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:56,970
What's it?

946
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,648
What do you want to ask me?

947
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:06,149
l was about to ask you
something but l forgot.

948
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:12,991
Even l was about to ask you something.
Forget it.

949
01:17:13,195 --> 01:17:13,820
Shall l take leave?

950
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:20,665
Couldn't you call me back once?

951
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:25,835
l told you many a times that
l don't have anybody with me.

952
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:29,177
l would've stayed as
your servant atleast.

953
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:33,346
Even then, why would
you call me?

954
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:35,342
Who am l to you?

955
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:38,519
l'm a fool.

956
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:43,354
It's all because of me. l wished
for things unnecessarily.

957
01:18:00,575 --> 01:18:02,873
l suddenly remembered what
l wanted to ask you.

958
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:07,706
Ask me quickly before
you forget again.

959
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:13,210
Do you want to come with me?

960
01:18:26,435 --> 01:18:34,740
Oh black girl...Was there a day when l
didn't see you? l regretted...

961
01:18:57,632 --> 01:19:02,433
Oh black girl...Was there a day when
l didn't see you?

962
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:08,098
l regretted that l wasn't
born a beetle.

963
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:29,286
l'm thinking of you in my heart.

964
01:20:26,721 --> 01:20:30,680
Oh pretty girl with a dot....
your coquettish talks....

965
01:20:30,892 --> 01:20:34,521
How did you make me your's?

966
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:38,688
When l saw you on the
mountain top.

967
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:42,529
Hymns came and chanted
in my ears.

968
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:46,863
Oh Golden girl....
Oh doe-eyed maiden.

969
01:20:47,075 --> 01:20:50,704
You've the magic veena
which cupid plays.

970
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:58,717
Rejoice your heart
- Oh thief rejoice yourself.

971
01:21:55,477 --> 01:22:03,441
With the beatings of drum, When you
come to me as a bull with golden horns...

972
01:22:03,985 --> 01:22:07,785
Adoring a dot and wearing stone bangles,

973
01:22:07,989 --> 01:22:10,958
Will you fly away singing?

974
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:19,794
l'm eager to sleep with you together!
Aren't you the dew drops?

975
01:22:20,001 --> 01:22:23,960
Hey stop...Stop...
Let me see your mischief.

976
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:27,972
In a little pond, l feel like chill dew
splashing on me when l swim with you.

977
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:25,195
l'll tell him that you're not
getting down from the cart.

978
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:29,863
Lets act like enemies till
l explain everything to him.

979
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:31,368
Do as l say, okay?

980
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:37,874
Have you reached?
Thank heavens!

981
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:39,546
Brother....Do you've legs and hands?

982
01:23:40,248 --> 01:23:42,216
Not that...Where's she?

983
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:45,544
There she's...

984
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:55,389
l feel shy...l feel shy...

985
01:23:56,765 --> 01:24:03,568
By plucking feathers, my lover'll
come this way.

986
01:24:30,965 --> 01:24:32,796
Manikutta, have you come?

987
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:34,296
l was very upset.

988
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:38,429
Can l believe the words of this liar?

989
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,230
l had taken many vows.

990
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:43,105
This mistake has been committed
because of the vow we had taken.

991
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:44,036
Right, brother?

992
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:48,080
Okay, who's she?

993
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:50,477
Ask the one who was
responsible for bringing her.

994
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:53,046
Srikrishna told me everything.
- Did he tell you everything?

995
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:54,721
Yes, l've told her everything.

996
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:56,754
Now listen to what she says.

997
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:58,119
It seems, she doesn't have
a place to go.

998
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:00,227
So she says that she'll stay
here doing some work.

999
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:02,396
Yes, this's a charitable institution
to give sheIter to everybody!

1000
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:05,062
l used all my efforts to put
her down from the cart.

1001
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,897
But she was very adamant
& didn't get down.

1002
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:09,229
l feel like bashing her up.

1003
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:16,240
Sister, poor girl. Lets give
her some work here.

1004
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:24,748
You don't cry...You stay here.

1005
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:28,582
What is her caste?
- Our caste only.

1006
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:29,415
How do you know her?

1007
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:30,750
l asked her.

1008
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:32,927
Her father's name is Govinda Nair.
- Mother's name is Chovakutty.

1009
01:25:33,495 --> 01:25:34,928
You don't create any problem now.

1010
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:37,431
She looks to be from
a pedigreed family.

1011
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:41,591
We need a person to do jobs inside.
You come...

1012
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:48,939
Then, you always create some problems
whenever you go to the fair & drink.

1013
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:51,772
Better stop drinking or
stop going to the fair.

1014
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,107
Oh God! My dear sister.
l swear on your head.

1015
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:58,615
No, now l'm unable to lift up my head
because of you keep on promising on it.

1016
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:00,280
Manikutta, you come here.

1017
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:02,448
You keep quiet.

1018
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:04,955
You keep your hand on his head.
- Oh mother, no....

1019
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:08,621
Keep your hand. Promise that
you'll not drink.

1020
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:09,463
Hereafter, l'll not drink.

1021
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,631
What?- Toddy.

1022
01:26:11,566 --> 01:26:16,629
It'll be affect your head
if he drinks again.

1023
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:18,969
Girl, you come.

1024
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:22,810
Brother....My head....

1025
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:26,643
l don't feel like laughing.

1026
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:36,149
Come Balamuruga...Pick up a
card for Srikrishna.

1027
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:58,174
Won't you give?
- l'll not.

1028
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:01,181
What're you talking? Brother....

1029
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:03,350
This's not the bull
but an elephant.

1030
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:04,848
Not one elephant....
But 5 elephants.

1031
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:07,351
This Bull can do the
job of 5 elephants.

1032
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:10,854
Lord Srikrishna's bull....Bull....

1033
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,357
Open its mouth and see.
Did you see its wide forehead?

1034
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:17,361
Look at his 8 white teeth.

1035
01:27:17,799 --> 01:27:21,360
You'll get the girl
whom you wish.

1036
01:27:21,736 --> 01:27:26,696
But don't talk about this to anyone
till the end of July.

1037
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:27,704
Why?

1038
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:30,707
You can buy the ornaments
after the new moon day.

1039
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:34,712
But don't talk to that girl
by your mouth.

1040
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:36,710
Greetings sir.

1041
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:38,215
Do l've to talk with my buttocks
if not with the month?

1042
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:41,715
lf you want to ask anything
write it down and ask.

1043
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,717
Parrot says so...

1044
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:48,388
You'll not get any girl
if you don't comply.

1045
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:53,064
Yes, that's right...Her family members
may not be interested in it.

1046
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:55,402
Parrot predicted and l've
told you.

1047
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:57,400
Parrot's words have come true.

1048
01:27:57,772 --> 01:28:00,741
Whatever parrot has predicted for me,
has come true.

1049
01:28:04,846 --> 01:28:06,245
No other problems, is it?

1050
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:14,085
How much money do you've? Save it,
it'll be needed for our marriage.

1051
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:15,756
lf you want this money, you marry
brother. This's his money.

1052
01:28:16,858 --> 01:28:18,086
Brother is hearing the
prediction of parrot.

1053
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:20,420
Parrot?- Yes, Thimmayan's parrot.

1054
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:23,757
Yes, parrot has predicted again that
we both'll get married.

1055
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:26,426
Do you know what people say here,

1056
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:28,602
That you'll not get a
girl like me.

1057
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:30,098
We both are made for each other.

1058
01:28:31,472 --> 01:28:32,769
Hey go away from here.

1059
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:34,601
lf anybody sees us...
It seems made for each other!

1060
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:43,272
What? Romancing man?
Shall l fix her for you?

1061
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:45,952
Oh God...l don't want.
- What's lacking in her?

1062
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:47,280
What's lacking in Kathu sister-in-law?

1063
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:49,782
l've warned you many times
not to talk about her.

1064
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:50,958
Then you don't talk about this.

1065
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,126
l'll talk about that
if you start this topic again.

1066
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:53,624
l'll not start that topic, if you don't talk
about this, that's all.

1067
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:56,296
Take the money.
- Where's Appakalai?

1068
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:58,458
Hey Appakalai.

1069
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:18,815
What has happened to him?

1070
01:29:20,755 --> 01:29:22,382
Come....

1071
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:32,158
With saffron on the forehead
and waiving his hand,

1072
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:35,666
Lord Srikrishna stands
infront of me.

1073
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:39,335
What're you doing now?

1074
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:42,839
l'm also watching him. There's
some change in his behaviour.

1075
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:44,170
Oh God! Brother, where's
your Kombu (moustache)?

1076
01:29:44,412 --> 01:29:45,674
What?- Where's your moustache?

1077
01:29:46,547 --> 01:29:50,506
l've changed away my style,

1078
01:29:51,085 --> 01:29:54,350
To trap a new kombu(girl).

1079
01:29:54,555 --> 01:29:55,180
Be explicit man.

1080
01:29:57,158 --> 01:30:00,355
Sister, haven't l fulfilled
all your wishes?

1081
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:02,859
Except marriage...

1082
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:07,194
Only that's left, right? Okay, you
needn't get angry with me for that.

1083
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:08,369
l'll marry.

1084
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:12,235
Oh my Goddess....What am l hearing?

1085
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:16,036
Oh Goddess, you needn't give me
anything more. This's enough for me.

1086
01:30:17,111 --> 01:30:19,045
Atleast now you've
thought of marrying.

1087
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:23,213
We've to celebrate this...
- Do something.

1088
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:27,547
Okay who's the girl?

1089
01:30:27,755 --> 01:30:31,714
l'll tell you about her
after the month of July.

1090
01:30:31,926 --> 01:30:35,225
This's bad time even to think about
auspicious things, that's why.

1091
01:30:35,797 --> 01:30:37,890
You've decided to marry, haven't you?
That's enough for me.

1092
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:42,729
Manikutta...Next is your marriage.
- Let Chinnu's marriage get over.

1093
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:45,235
l'll take care of her marriage.
She's my sister too.

1094
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,236
You just talk about your's.

1095
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:51,902
l've promised her that l'll think about
me only after your marriage.

1096
01:30:52,113 --> 01:30:54,581
Right?- Yes, whatever
he said is right.

1097
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,577
Oh my Goddess...
Shower your benevolence.

1098
01:30:57,785 --> 01:31:02,245
lmmediately, l'll make arrangements to
light the lamp & worship in the temple.

1099
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:06,586
Oh...What a shame! Come here.

1100
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:10,597
Who's the girl?

1101
01:31:11,632 --> 01:31:13,259
l was told that let this
July end.

1102
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:14,765
Who?- Timmayan.

1103
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:17,604
Hell with Timmayan &
his parrot.

1104
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:19,936
Has his words ever come true?

1105
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:22,939
What hasn't come true?
- No, what has come true?

1106
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:27,274
Last ''Pongal'', didn't we win the race
with the bull he suggested.

1107
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:30,280
When he had asked us to
plant sugarcane,

1108
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:32,612
Didn't the paddy get ruined?

1109
01:31:32,987 --> 01:31:36,115
3 cows which we bought
without heeding his words.

1110
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:36,949
Didn't they fall sick and die?

1111
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:38,618
Timmayan words always come true.

1112
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:39,952
What did you say her name is?

1113
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:42,629
Her name is...Let July end.

1114
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:46,622
Okay let it end.
l know the girl.

1115
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:49,299
Who?

1116
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:54,304
Shall l tell you the
first letter of her name?

1117
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:55,635
Go ahead...

1118
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:02,980
K. - Just K or Ka.

1119
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:04,981
Ka....

1120
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:09,656
Hey, how did you find out?

1121
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:12,325
Hey thief. She's Kathu sister.

1122
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:26,332
Hell with Kathu sister.

1123
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:34,174
Brother...l've kept pancakes
and curry inside.

1124
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:36,850
You needn't fear....
l did the curry.

1125
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:37,847
You'll like it.

1126
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:48,691
l'll go home & come back
after fixing my sister's marriage.

1127
01:32:48,896 --> 01:32:50,693
She's salivating too much for you.

1128
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:52,695
l'm watching this for
past 2-3 days.

1129
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,868
What bothers you?
- Nothing bothers me.

1130
01:32:55,736 --> 01:32:58,364
Will you get something for me
when you come back?

1131
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:01,041
What?- Black bangles.

1132
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:04,875
We believe that if we wear black bangles
our marriage will be performed soon.

1133
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:08,207
Only that's remaining now.
l've some other work, girl.

1134
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:09,713
l'm not your servant.

1135
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:11,718
l'm not telling you anything
now since l'm going out.

1136
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:13,045
What happened?- Nothing.

1137
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:15,055
What happened?

1138
01:33:15,756 --> 01:33:19,715
l just asked him to get me black
bangles when he comes back.

1139
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:21,391
And he has started shouting.

1140
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:23,063
Wild buffalo!

1141
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:25,896
Simple! Couldn't you ask
me to get them?

1142
01:33:58,466 --> 01:33:59,091
Why're you laughing now?

1143
01:34:02,803 --> 01:34:04,430
Did you see anything?

1144
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,266
l couldn't see....Did you see?

1145
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:07,941
What?- Her changing the dress.

1146
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:12,943
You idiot, get lost....
go man....

1147
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:20,620
Stay there.

1148
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:29,125
Don't tell anyone that l had peeped
into her room. Heard?

1149
01:34:29,997 --> 01:34:32,465
Heard?- Yes l heard.

1150
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:36,792
What?- That you're going to
marry her, aren't you?

1151
01:34:37,838 --> 01:34:41,638
You needn't tease me...
Do you need any money?

1152
01:34:41,842 --> 01:34:43,309
l don't want money. - Then?

1153
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:47,038
But l need an old dress
of your's to wear.

1154
01:34:47,682 --> 01:34:49,377
l'll tell sister. Get it from her.

1155
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:54,318
l'll whip you if this gets leaked.

1156
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:06,666
Oh my heart!

1157
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:11,270
l'm eagerly waiting for the day
we're going to get united.

1158
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:14,004
These black bangles which
hold 1000 kisses....

1159
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:18,042
When l see you wearing them,
My heart will be in ecstasy.

1160
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:19,277
Your's Srikrishna.

1161
01:35:32,893 --> 01:35:39,526
l saw the bride
selected by the lord.

1162
01:36:05,826 --> 01:36:10,058
Parrot says, that girl's mind will
not change if you give her chain & bangles.

1163
01:36:10,264 --> 01:36:13,893
Then ask the parrot what's the other
way for me to marry her?

1164
01:36:14,268 --> 01:36:18,329
What l could see is that this'll
not take place in a direct way.

1165
01:36:19,106 --> 01:36:22,405
Even if it curves a little
it's enough if l marry her.

1166
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:23,804
There's only one way for that.

1167
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:27,239
Ask all the bachelors here
not to marry her.

1168
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:29,674
She'll marry you only if she doesn't
find anybody.

1169
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:37,147
What's the price of this parrot?
- l'll not sell the parrot.

1170
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:39,422
This's my livelihood.
- You needn't sell.

1171
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:42,027
But l want to know how much will l've
to give if l kill it.

1172
01:36:42,296 --> 01:36:46,164
You and your parrot are predicting
some nonsense to her.

1173
01:36:46,467 --> 01:36:48,162
l'll kill you both & throw
in the water.

1174
01:36:59,146 --> 01:36:59,942
Take the thing which
you had asked me to bring.

1175
01:37:00,147 --> 01:37:01,444
What's this?- Black bangles.

1176
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:04,277
Marriage needn't be stopped by not
wearing them.

1177
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:06,119
Anyway you've bought the bangles.

1178
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,617
Why don't you put them on
for me?

1179
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:10,052
lf anybody sees...
Look, mother.

1180
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:18,860
Karthumbi, if you want to go to
the temple, then come soon.

1181
01:37:21,001 --> 01:37:22,798
Sister, ask the keeper of the bull
Velaiyan to remain here when he comes.

1182
01:37:23,003 --> 01:37:23,628
l'll come back soon.

1183
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:30,408
Superb.

1184
01:37:35,349 --> 01:37:36,213
Bangles.

1185
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:40,881
Bangles suit you well.

1186
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:43,653
l didn't think that
they'll match you so well.

1187
01:37:44,525 --> 01:37:46,493
Now you've seen.

1188
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:50,558
Couldn't put them on my hand
when they were bought for me?

1189
01:37:51,198 --> 01:37:52,096
Rude person!

1190
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:56,332
Even then you like, right?

1191
01:37:57,037 --> 01:37:59,665
Would l say like this
if l don't like?

1192
01:38:01,876 --> 01:38:05,573
Not rude Thumbi.
Waiting for the time.

1193
01:38:06,046 --> 01:38:07,513
Then why do you need
black bangles?

1194
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:09,444
Can't get you golden bangles?

1195
01:38:10,384 --> 01:38:12,682
Wait till July ends.

1196
01:38:13,053 --> 01:38:14,520
Marriage'll be performed soon.

1197
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:46,879
It's the marriage offerings.

1198
01:38:47,087 --> 01:38:51,046
This's the marriage time.

1199
01:38:51,258 --> 01:38:55,627
Aren't you the
Goddess of music?

1200
01:38:56,096 --> 01:39:03,730
You sing.

1201
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:17,580
lf sky is clear & if our
hearts are contented,

1202
01:39:17,785 --> 01:39:21,084
Marriage is warranted.

1203
01:39:21,522 --> 01:39:25,925
Shyness will swing my
heart with the golden swing.

1204
01:39:26,126 --> 01:39:29,254
It's time for celebration.

1205
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:33,589
With the Golden Chariot,

1206
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:38,431
Bring auspicious pendant
for Karthumbi.

1207
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:29,486
Paddy swings in the fields,
Aren't you the spike?

1208
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:32,818
Rain clouds are coming
in the chariot.

1209
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:37,319
Aren't you the rainbow?

1210
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:41,831
Oh water Lily, come into my
heart & jump with joy.

1211
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:54,010
Oh flower, come to adore
the Pearl necklace.

1212
01:40:54,381 --> 01:40:58,841
Lets join together tonight and watch
the festival publicly.

1213
01:41:54,274 --> 01:42:02,238
Moon light is waning.
Aren't you the new moon?

1214
01:42:02,783 --> 01:42:05,911
l can hear the dance steps.

1215
01:42:06,787 --> 01:42:10,416
It's time for the spikes
of the corn to play.

1216
01:42:10,691 --> 01:42:14,593
Oh Parrot. Come to marry me.

1217
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:27,096
Give me your golden feathery cage
to live.

1218
01:42:27,307 --> 01:42:31,607
Who presented me this new hand spun
silk bordered saree?

1219
01:43:10,951 --> 01:43:13,317
10 sovereigns of jewels & Rs.5000.

1220
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,488
Or according to the
present capacity,

1221
01:43:15,689 --> 01:43:16,986
15 milchy cows.

1222
01:43:17,191 --> 01:43:18,818
What's that calculation man?

1223
01:43:19,426 --> 01:43:21,826
Groom's father deals
in cattle business.

1224
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:24,657
So, he demanded cows,
if not money.

1225
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:27,497
What about the groom?
- He's the signaler for the trains.

1226
01:43:28,702 --> 01:43:30,829
We needn't accept this proposal
giving this much of dowry.

1227
01:43:31,104 --> 01:43:32,332
Oh God...Reducing more
than is...

1228
01:43:32,539 --> 01:43:33,665
Who asked to reduce?

1229
01:43:34,041 --> 01:43:36,009
She's not your daughter.

1230
01:43:36,543 --> 01:43:38,841
But Manickam's sister
of Madambi house.

1231
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:42,515
This proposal doesn't suit Madambi.

1232
01:43:42,716 --> 01:43:44,013
What're you saying?

1233
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:48,343
Manickam came here & helped
me to make all these things.

1234
01:43:48,555 --> 01:43:50,682
His sister is, my sister too....

1235
01:43:50,891 --> 01:43:54,349
l'll give 20 sovereigns of jewels
and 25,000 as dowry.

1236
01:43:54,561 --> 01:43:57,359
Find a suitable groom and fix it.

1237
01:43:57,564 --> 01:44:00,533
Next time you come here
only with the marriage invitation.

1238
01:44:00,734 --> 01:44:01,701
Don't ask anything further.

1239
01:44:02,402 --> 01:44:04,529
Do we need such an
exaIted proposal?

1240
01:44:04,738 --> 01:44:07,366
Madambi people don't
change their words.

1241
01:44:07,574 --> 01:44:09,542
Do you've a doubt?
- No.

1242
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:12,205
This year, many marriages
will be performed here.

1243
01:44:12,412 --> 01:44:15,381
l'm thinking of performing
all the marriages together.

1244
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:18,050
l thought of something.

1245
01:44:18,418 --> 01:44:20,716
You need some money for
your journey, right? Wait.

1246
01:44:24,825 --> 01:44:26,053
Did you hear?

1247
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:30,556
Government job isn't as great as
working in the kitchen of Madambi house.

1248
01:44:31,265 --> 01:44:35,395
They're grateful people. We've to
worship them with flowers.

1249
01:44:37,104 --> 01:44:37,900
We've to worship.

1250
01:44:38,305 --> 01:44:41,741
We've to worship the auspicious
pendant & ornaments in the temple.

1251
01:44:41,975 --> 01:44:43,738
Lets do that after the engagement.

1252
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:51,740
l didn't think that she was your
sweetheart, she being here for so long.

1253
01:44:52,452 --> 01:44:55,421
That's why, purposely father named
you like this.

1254
01:44:55,856 --> 01:44:57,084
You're the thief Krishnan.

1255
01:44:58,191 --> 01:45:00,751
You've made everything
ready without my knowledge.

1256
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:05,424
For the first time, l thought
that l need a girl.

1257
01:45:05,666 --> 01:45:09,762
That time Timmayan asked me to tell
this to everyone after the end of July.

1258
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:14,429
In case of any obstacles,
l'll not get married ever.

1259
01:45:14,975 --> 01:45:21,437
What obstacles'll arise....
- Nothing...Forget me. Do you like her?

1260
01:45:22,215 --> 01:45:23,614
She's Goddess Lakshmi, right?

1261
01:45:23,817 --> 01:45:27,275
Even if she's a demon, l'll consider
her as Goddess Lakshmi, if you like her.

1262
01:45:29,156 --> 01:45:31,624
Advise Manickam.

1263
01:45:31,992 --> 01:45:34,460
Manickam & Thumbi are like mongoose &
snake when they meet each other.

1264
01:45:34,661 --> 01:45:37,129
Now onwards, we're going to live under
the same roof, isn't it?

1265
01:45:37,331 --> 01:45:39,128
Won't he change his mind
when he comes to know that,

1266
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:40,630
She's his sister-in-law?

1267
01:45:40,901 --> 01:45:42,300
He'll carry her on his
shoulder and roam.

1268
01:45:42,502 --> 01:45:44,470
l'll show these things to her
and come.

1269
01:45:48,508 --> 01:45:53,969
l feel shy...l feel shy....

1270
01:45:57,517 --> 01:46:00,816
l came to know about the secret love
affair going on here.

1271
01:46:05,726 --> 01:46:09,162
You both were cheating us for
these many days, right?

1272
01:46:09,529 --> 01:46:11,656
Oh God! l was told that it'll be better
if we tell you at the right time.

1273
01:46:11,865 --> 01:46:13,492
Right time has come now.

1274
01:46:13,734 --> 01:46:18,000
My dear brother has purchased saree &
auspicious pendant for marriage.

1275
01:46:18,205 --> 01:46:20,833
Now, marriage band &
the hub-hub are remaining.

1276
01:46:21,208 --> 01:46:23,676
He didn't say that he has made
so much of arrangements.

1277
01:46:23,877 --> 01:46:26,004
He just said that it'll take place
after the end of this month.

1278
01:46:26,546 --> 01:46:28,673
Engagements arrangements are made.

1279
01:46:28,882 --> 01:46:32,511
We'll fix the time when priest comes
on Monday from Mangalapuram.

1280
01:46:33,286 --> 01:46:34,844
Don't we've to inform
Manickam's father?

1281
01:46:35,088 --> 01:46:40,355
Mancikam told me that we'll
marry after his sister's marriage.

1282
01:46:42,963 --> 01:46:44,191
What're you saying?

1283
01:46:45,565 --> 01:46:48,193
Manickam told me that brother
has some girl in his mind,

1284
01:46:48,402 --> 01:46:50,870
And marriage will take
place immediately.

1285
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:57,207
Manickam planned to disclose our affair
to everyone after that.

1286
01:46:58,245 --> 01:47:00,042
That's why, l too kept it
as a secret.

1287
01:47:02,315 --> 01:47:06,046
Does Krishnan know that
you & Manickam are in love?

1288
01:47:06,586 --> 01:47:08,884
Yes...He teases me often.

1289
01:47:09,089 --> 01:47:13,048
That's why, he made our marriage
arrangements without our knowledge.

1290
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:17,389
Manickam'll be shocked when he
knows this, right mother?

1291
01:47:18,098 --> 01:47:21,067
Whatever it's, you don't tell
this to Manickam.

1292
01:47:21,268 --> 01:47:28,231
Let Krishnan tell him directly.
You don't know his intention, right?

1293
01:47:28,809 --> 01:47:30,401
Okay, l'll not tell him.

1294
01:47:50,964 --> 01:47:51,760
What?

1295
01:47:52,165 --> 01:47:54,258
l want to tell you something.

1296
01:47:54,501 --> 01:47:57,595
Here? - l can't talk
to you at home.

1297
01:47:58,138 --> 01:48:02,438
That's why, l brought you to
the temple. Not only for that,

1298
01:48:02,809 --> 01:48:05,937
Praying before committing a
deliberate mistake.

1299
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:10,939
When l feel guiIty of my crime, l chant
God's name & get relieved, right?

1300
01:48:11,485 --> 01:48:12,782
What're you saying mother?

1301
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:14,784
Even if l'm not your own mother,

1302
01:48:14,988 --> 01:48:19,948
lf you consider me as your foster
mother, then you've to heed my words.

1303
01:48:21,127 --> 01:48:24,585
lf you've considered me as your son,
then tell me.

1304
01:48:25,198 --> 01:48:28,929
l know that you like Karthumbi.

1305
01:48:31,671 --> 01:48:32,797
You've to forget her.

1306
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:38,641
You love me and your brother
more than her, right?

1307
01:48:40,313 --> 01:48:43,544
Couldn't you forsake
her for our sake?

1308
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:45,718
But what's her mistake?

1309
01:48:45,919 --> 01:48:47,716
She didn't commit any mistake.

1310
01:48:47,988 --> 01:48:49,546
But my brother has committed
the mistake.

1311
01:48:50,857 --> 01:48:53,155
He has loved a girl for
the first time.

1312
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:57,159
He bought gold jewels & sari
for her like a fool,

1313
01:48:57,364 --> 01:48:59,332
And he's dreaming about
the marriage.

1314
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:04,999
He didn't know that his heart
is jumping like kids.

1315
01:49:05,539 --> 01:49:08,508
But you're in the girl's
heart whom he loves.

1316
01:49:09,709 --> 01:49:13,668
He'll not be able to bear it
if he comes to know this.

1317
01:49:14,681 --> 01:49:20,381
That's why, l'm cruel to you.
Forget her.

1318
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:24,019
lf you can...Ask her
also to forget you.

1319
01:49:26,326 --> 01:49:29,853
Don't you know that l'm eager to
see that he leads a family life.

1320
01:49:31,064 --> 01:49:34,192
Since, l didn't find any other way...
Please obey...

1321
01:49:34,734 --> 01:49:37,362
Orelse l'll curse you.

1322
01:49:47,747 --> 01:49:51,877
For the Lords(Bosses), slaves lives
are similar to the life of the cattle.

1323
01:49:53,453 --> 01:49:56,354
Buying cattle in the fair.
Feeding them grass & bran,

1324
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:59,718
Making them heaIthy and let them
lie in the cattle shed.

1325
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:03,228
They'll sell them when its profitable.

1326
01:50:04,097 --> 01:50:06,895
And'll not ask whether they're taking
them for slaughtering or rearing.

1327
01:50:07,167 --> 01:50:12,901
That's why, l say...Believing them,
l can't marry you now.

1328
01:50:13,940 --> 01:50:16,568
Let me own something first, then
l'll think about it.

1329
01:50:17,277 --> 01:50:19,745
You had'nt told me about
this earlier.

1330
01:50:20,447 --> 01:50:24,247
Have you seen any person
who's constant in his views?

1331
01:50:24,451 --> 01:50:26,919
Tell me if you don't like me.
l'll leave.

1332
01:50:27,454 --> 01:50:32,084
Did l tell you like that?
- l feIt so when you said like that.

1333
01:50:32,292 --> 01:50:33,759
Karthumbi, don't cry.

1334
01:50:34,794 --> 01:50:36,591
Whatever has to happen
has happened.

1335
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:38,263
My father used to say,

1336
01:50:38,465 --> 01:50:43,926
That we're not the deciding authority
but its God. Believe him.

1337
01:50:55,315 --> 01:50:57,112
Hey do it fast. - Greetings sir.

1338
01:50:58,652 --> 01:51:01,120
What Lord? Feast?

1339
01:51:02,155 --> 01:51:03,122
What's going on man?

1340
01:51:04,324 --> 01:51:06,451
Your parrot's words are true.

1341
01:51:06,993 --> 01:51:09,791
On my behalf, get some
fruits & milk for the parrot.

1342
01:51:17,370 --> 01:51:20,134
His parrot will not tell the truth.
- Who said?

1343
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:24,970
l say....lf parrot had
told you the truth,

1344
01:51:25,178 --> 01:51:28,477
Then why didn't the parrot say
that everybody is cheating you?

1345
01:51:28,682 --> 01:51:34,814
Cheating me? Who? - l'll not say Lord.
You'll not believe me.

1346
01:51:35,055 --> 01:51:38,821
Tell me what it's. - l'll not.

1347
01:51:39,459 --> 01:51:42,656
l'm afraid to say what l saw
and heard.

1348
01:51:42,862 --> 01:51:43,988
But l'm sure of one thing.

1349
01:51:44,197 --> 01:51:46,825
You've fed milk to a snake
for these many years.

1350
01:51:47,367 --> 01:51:52,999
Manickam is a cobra. - l'll kill you
if you bad mouth, Manickam.

1351
01:51:53,406 --> 01:51:56,842
Kill me...l'm happy to die
at your hands.

1352
01:51:57,377 --> 01:51:59,504
Whatever it's, let me tell
the truth and die.

1353
01:51:59,879 --> 01:52:04,839
Your marriage will not take place.
- Marriage will not take place?

1354
01:52:05,218 --> 01:52:06,515
Yes...He'll not perform it.

1355
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:09,348
l saw with these eyes.
Heard with these ears.

1356
01:52:09,723 --> 01:52:16,856
That Manickam kissed her. You're my
God. l'll tell you the truth only.

1357
01:52:17,397 --> 01:52:21,527
He told her it'll be better if you
marry any donkey rather marry you.

1358
01:52:22,235 --> 01:52:27,867
It seems, you've lost your pick up &
you'll not have children.

1359
01:52:28,074 --> 01:52:30,042
l started boiling with rage
when l heard it.

1360
01:52:31,778 --> 01:52:34,872
Are you telling the truth?
- You call both of them and ask.

1361
01:52:35,081 --> 01:52:35,877
Then you'll know.

1362
01:52:36,316 --> 01:52:39,547
She hugged and told him,
''lets run away somewhere''.

1363
01:52:39,753 --> 01:52:45,385
And he replied, ''Not necessary. Lets rob
the money & ornaments & run away''

1364
01:52:46,459 --> 01:52:48,552
This isn't a recent affair.

1365
01:52:49,362 --> 01:52:53,059
She's a simpleton. But Manickam
has manipulated her.

1366
01:52:56,269 --> 01:52:59,727
So, was he cheating me
for these many years?

1367
01:53:01,107 --> 01:53:04,565
Were they both enacting a
drama before me?

1368
01:53:04,944 --> 01:53:06,411
Ungrateful dogs!

1369
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:10,242
We've to pluck the teeth of that ungrateful
dog which bit the benevolent hand.

1370
01:53:10,950 --> 01:53:11,575
Then let him run away.

1371
01:53:11,785 --> 01:53:12,911
We shouldn't pardon.

1372
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:14,245
He should go away
from this place.

1373
01:53:15,355 --> 01:53:18,415
lf you're born to one father,
you've to do this.

1374
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:22,928
No need...Not now.

1375
01:53:27,634 --> 01:53:31,263
l want her....l'm very
particular about it.

1376
01:53:32,839 --> 01:53:36,434
l'll decide about what to do
with the other one.

1377
01:54:05,004 --> 01:54:13,309
Where were you last night?
Manickam went home.

1378
01:54:14,013 --> 01:54:15,810
Tomorrow is Chinnu's engagement.

1379
01:54:16,549 --> 01:54:19,484
He was waiting here till
dusk to inform you.

1380
01:54:23,423 --> 01:54:25,653
Have you drunk?- Yes...

1381
01:54:27,026 --> 01:54:32,123
You made me swear on that cheap
fellow that l'll not drink.

1382
01:54:32,332 --> 01:54:36,291
You had said, ''thunder will strike
his head if l drink hereafter''

1383
01:54:36,836 --> 01:54:42,468
l drank for it to strike.
- Krishna, don't talk unknowingly.

1384
01:54:42,842 --> 01:54:45,310
l know everything...
l've come to know everything.

1385
01:54:45,578 --> 01:54:50,641
l wished that you shouldn't
know anything.

1386
01:54:50,850 --> 01:54:54,980
l wished that whatever l heard
shouldn't be true. Now l'm sure.

1387
01:54:55,188 --> 01:54:58,157
Please listen to what l say.
- No need.

1388
01:54:58,558 --> 01:55:00,651
Everybody was fooling me, right?

1389
01:55:01,027 --> 01:55:04,485
l'm a fool....You made me
a clown & enjoyed.

1390
01:55:04,864 --> 01:55:08,163
Even you've joined their mirth without
bothering about me.

1391
01:55:08,735 --> 01:55:14,674
He's not as you think. He's a poor
fellow.- No...He's a snake.

1392
01:55:14,874 --> 01:55:16,671
He bit the hand
which fed him.

1393
01:55:17,076 --> 01:55:23,675
Hereafter nobody should support him.
l've only one thing to tell you.

1394
01:55:23,950 --> 01:55:26,510
Hereafter, l & he'll not
live under this roof.

1395
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:38,890
Yes Lord. - l want her.

1396
01:55:39,098 --> 01:55:41,896
For that she has to
forget Manickam.

1397
01:55:42,101 --> 01:55:46,731
Only then l'll get her.
- l'm getting an idea in my small brain.

1398
01:55:49,442 --> 01:55:50,739
My uncle's daughter, isn't it,

1399
01:55:50,944 --> 01:55:52,411
Kuyili.

1400
01:55:53,112 --> 01:55:54,739
Yes the servant maid here.

1401
01:55:56,282 --> 01:55:58,580
She's interested in
Manickam & not me.

1402
01:55:59,118 --> 01:56:02,918
She's after him to marry him.
The whole village knows about this.

1403
01:56:03,890 --> 01:56:06,916
So...The idea which is brewing
into my small brain...

1404
01:56:07,126 --> 01:56:08,753
Hey, tell me man.

1405
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:15,092
Lets make Kuyili tell in panchayat
that she has lost her chastity.

1406
01:56:15,301 --> 01:56:18,099
Panchayat will ask her
who the person is.

1407
01:56:18,538 --> 01:56:20,768
It's enough if she says
it's Manickam.

1408
01:56:23,309 --> 01:56:26,767
Panchayat'll agree when
a girl says so.

1409
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:28,777
It'll order Manickam
to marry her.

1410
01:56:28,982 --> 01:56:32,941
He'll not listen. Then Panchayat will
ask him to leave the place.

1411
01:56:33,653 --> 01:56:34,449
He'll run away.

1412
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:43,128
This was the idea which was brewing
in my small brain.

1413
01:56:43,997 --> 01:56:46,465
This isn't the idea emerging
from a small brain.

1414
01:56:49,168 --> 01:56:52,296
And Karthumbi will hate him &
forget him for that.

1415
01:56:54,007 --> 01:56:57,636
Very good. 2 birds with one stone!

1416
01:56:58,011 --> 01:57:00,138
Tomorrow there'll be 3 birds in
the small brain.

1417
01:57:00,513 --> 01:57:02,981
Which is the 3rd one?

1418
01:57:03,516 --> 01:57:05,143
lf Manickam goes away,

1419
01:57:05,685 --> 01:57:07,312
Then Kuyili will become
an unchaste woman.

1420
01:57:08,021 --> 01:57:09,818
So nobody'll marry her.

1421
01:57:10,590 --> 01:57:14,151
Only l know that she's not
unchaste & l'll marry her.

1422
01:57:18,197 --> 01:57:21,166
You're really superb!

1423
01:57:22,602 --> 01:57:24,661
This idea got into my
small brain.

1424
01:57:26,372 --> 01:57:29,830
That's why, God purposely didn't
give you a big brain.

1425
01:57:30,877 --> 01:57:33,004
But will Kuyili agree to it?

1426
01:57:33,813 --> 01:57:36,179
Just because she likes Manickam
she'll agree.

1427
01:57:36,716 --> 01:57:39,685
You've to make her agree
just because you like Karthumbi.

1428
01:57:40,219 --> 01:57:42,016
You've to show your talents there.

1429
01:58:03,276 --> 01:58:05,540
l'm afraid Lord.

1430
01:58:07,914 --> 01:58:12,874
l know how much you
love Manickam.

1431
01:58:13,586 --> 01:58:16,384
But that girl has
cajoled him nicely.

1432
01:58:16,923 --> 01:58:19,721
lf you want him...Then
this is the only way.

1433
01:58:19,926 --> 01:58:21,553
l'm telling you to do this
out of affection,

1434
01:58:21,761 --> 01:58:23,888
Or would l stand besides
you to do such a thing?

1435
01:58:25,598 --> 01:58:26,565
You say it boldly.

1436
01:59:03,136 --> 01:59:09,439
Since l know the accused very well,
it's not right for me to take a decision.

1437
01:59:09,809 --> 01:59:15,611
So let Madam Gandhari & other's here
think & take a decision.

1438
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:25,453
Since its proved that Manickam
has raped Kuyili,

1439
01:59:25,658 --> 01:59:29,287
We've decided that he should marry her
& redeem his folly.

1440
01:59:31,664 --> 01:59:34,633
l don't know who's
behind this plot.

1441
01:59:36,836 --> 01:59:41,967
l'll marry her. Only l should
marry the one l've raped.

1442
01:59:43,509 --> 01:59:46,637
l'll be with her &
give money for her expenses.

1443
01:59:47,513 --> 01:59:49,310
lf she's pregnant, then she'll
deliver the baby, won't she?

1444
01:59:49,515 --> 01:59:50,311
l'll marry her at that time.

1445
01:59:53,953 --> 01:59:55,318
lf she's not pregnant,

1446
01:59:55,521 --> 02:00:01,323
Will any of you insist that l marry
the girl whom l don't like?

1447
02:00:06,766 --> 02:00:10,167
l'm reacting positively to the decision
taken by the Panchayat.

1448
02:00:10,436 --> 02:00:12,336
Please show mercy on me.

1449
02:00:13,773 --> 02:00:17,504
Since his request is just,

1450
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:20,008
We've decided that
let him do what he has said.

1451
02:00:31,724 --> 02:00:34,192
l want to ask you something.
- lf l don't want to hear anything...

1452
02:00:34,894 --> 02:00:39,024
When l think that l had been with
such a dirty creep, l feel ashamed.

1453
02:00:39,232 --> 02:00:42,360
Brother... - Don't call me brother
anymore, everything has ended.

1454
02:00:42,568 --> 02:00:45,196
lf you step in there by claiming
our old relationship...

1455
02:00:46,072 --> 02:00:46,697
Come man.

1456
02:01:03,422 --> 02:01:06,220
l knew that such problems
will crop up.

1457
02:01:06,425 --> 02:01:08,723
But l didn't think it'll be
magnified like this.

1458
02:01:10,930 --> 02:01:12,397
Shame!

1459
02:01:13,165 --> 02:01:18,228
Now l'm unable to face the people.
What's the use of crying?

1460
02:01:19,605 --> 02:01:22,073
Atleast now you understand one thing.

1461
02:01:22,375 --> 02:01:26,072
Shouldn't love a person falling
for the beauty and age.

1462
02:01:26,279 --> 02:01:27,246
But nobility should be the criterion.

1463
02:01:28,114 --> 02:01:30,912
l...don't think, l'm...

1464
02:01:44,864 --> 02:01:45,922
You've sinned.

1465
02:01:46,132 --> 02:01:48,100
Yes, what else could l do?

1466
02:01:48,467 --> 02:01:50,264
Atleast now l thought of
caring for myself.

1467
02:01:50,469 --> 02:01:52,096
Orelse he would've
betrayed me further.

1468
02:01:53,306 --> 02:01:54,933
l'm talking about you only.

1469
02:01:55,141 --> 02:01:58,440
What did l do?

1470
02:01:58,644 --> 02:02:02,102
It's hurting you, right?

1471
02:02:02,682 --> 02:02:06,448
You were silent when he had hurt me
after being with you for these many years.

1472
02:02:06,652 --> 02:02:09,780
You're thinking and worrying about
some beggar, right?

1473
02:02:10,556 --> 02:02:12,751
You and Manikuttan are
same to me.

1474
02:02:12,992 --> 02:02:15,961
Manikuttan! That son of
your's is dead.

1475
02:02:16,162 --> 02:02:18,289
He'll not become your son
if you call him son.

1476
02:02:18,497 --> 02:02:21,625
But l'm your brother, who wasted my
life for your sake.

1477
02:02:21,834 --> 02:02:23,802
Don't forget that & compare
me with him.

1478
02:02:25,371 --> 02:02:27,965
You've not spoken to
me like this so far.

1479
02:02:28,174 --> 02:02:31,803
No...l've not told you anything harsh
other than calling you sister.

1480
02:02:32,011 --> 02:02:35,139
But when l see my sister crying
for the one who has hurt me,

1481
02:02:35,348 --> 02:02:35,814
l'm boiling.

1482
02:02:36,182 --> 02:02:38,480
l don't have the generosity
to bear it.

1483
02:02:39,352 --> 02:02:43,311
l'll not say anything more.
Do as you like.

1484
02:02:43,522 --> 02:02:47,822
l'll be only with you.
l don't have anybody other than you.

1485
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:11,338
l've come with the invitation.
l should give you the first one.

1486
02:03:13,552 --> 02:03:16,180
Dear...Give it to him gracefully.

1487
02:03:26,899 --> 02:03:29,527
You would've known what
had happened here, right?

1488
02:03:29,735 --> 02:03:31,532
l don't know what happened.

1489
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:34,539
Your son raped
Kuyili who's working here.

1490
02:03:34,774 --> 02:03:37,538
Panchayat has ordered
him to live with her.

1491
02:03:37,743 --> 02:03:43,204
Now Lord is going out by covering
his face. - He may be simply saying.

1492
02:03:43,416 --> 02:03:45,884
Lord...My son'll not do
such a nasty thing.

1493
02:03:46,085 --> 02:03:47,712
Then, he might not be
your son.

1494
02:03:48,988 --> 02:03:52,549
l thought of telling
you something.

1495
02:03:53,426 --> 02:03:56,224
This time even though there
were dark clouds.

1496
02:03:56,462 --> 02:03:58,726
But there were no enough rains.

1497
02:03:59,098 --> 02:04:01,726
l can deliver the produce in the fair
only if l start the work in the fields.

1498
02:04:01,934 --> 02:04:05,392
So, the amount which l promised
to pay for her marriage,

1499
02:04:05,604 --> 02:04:07,902
Now, l'm unable to pay.

1500
02:04:08,107 --> 02:04:10,234
Lord, don't say like that.

1501
02:04:10,476 --> 02:04:13,741
l fixed the time and printed the
invitation only by heeding your words.

1502
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:16,407
Did l think that this year will
be unprofitable when l promised you?

1503
02:04:17,483 --> 02:04:20,748
You only said that Madambi
people will not change their words.

1504
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:23,748
Can we change the limbs,
if not the words?

1505
02:04:23,956 --> 02:04:26,424
Just became you gave your son
to look after our fields & cattle,

1506
02:04:26,625 --> 02:04:29,093
l didn't promise you that l'll take
care of your entire family.

1507
02:04:29,295 --> 02:04:32,753
Don't come here again regarding this.
- Lord...

1508
02:04:33,165 --> 02:04:36,100
Enough father...After hearing all this,
are you still of worshiping him?

1509
02:04:36,302 --> 02:04:39,430
You needn't stoop so low to
perform my marriage.

1510
02:04:39,638 --> 02:04:40,764
Don't dear.

1511
02:04:40,973 --> 02:04:42,941
Don't the slaves have
shame & modesty?

1512
02:04:43,175 --> 02:04:45,109
lf you want to come, then come.
l'm going.

1513
02:04:56,055 --> 02:04:58,285
Do you think, l'm a debauch?

1514
02:04:58,491 --> 02:05:01,119
No, but when he said...

1515
02:05:01,727 --> 02:05:05,458
You don't listen to others.
l know my brother well.

1516
02:05:05,664 --> 02:05:07,962
He's insuIting you having
some animus.

1517
02:05:09,168 --> 02:05:12,467
Rather getting me married using his
money, It's better to kill me.

1518
02:05:13,339 --> 02:05:16,308
You were minding your business, but
l bothered you with the marriage proposal.

1519
02:05:16,876 --> 02:05:18,468
l'll perform your marriage.

1520
02:05:19,211 --> 02:05:21,475
Otherwise why should l be
called a brother?

1521
02:05:23,349 --> 02:05:24,976
Day is fixed after Pongal, isn't it?

1522
02:05:25,184 --> 02:05:28,312
You print the invitations, l'll perform
her marriage by taking loans.

1523
02:05:29,889 --> 02:05:31,652
l've the stamina to
work and repay them.

1524
02:05:32,691 --> 02:05:33,487
You go with hope.

1525
02:05:43,569 --> 02:05:46,663
Manickam, somebody has come from
Gandhari house in search of you.

1526
02:06:00,052 --> 02:06:02,179
Manickam, you sit down.

1527
02:06:02,454 --> 02:06:05,184
Rajaiya, put a mat for Manickam.

1528
02:06:06,392 --> 02:06:09,020
You were meekly adjusting with the Lord
in Madambi house, right?

1529
02:06:09,228 --> 02:06:12,197
Don't consider yourself inferior
because you've come here.

1530
02:06:13,566 --> 02:06:16,535
You know that Pongal is nearing.
- Yes.

1531
02:06:16,735 --> 02:06:21,195
l heard that you're not driving
Madambi people's cart this time.

1532
02:06:22,741 --> 02:06:26,370
Yes.... - Then, can't you
drive my cart?

1533
02:06:29,248 --> 02:06:33,207
What?- What'll l get?

1534
02:06:33,419 --> 02:06:34,886
Half of the bet amount.

1535
02:06:36,155 --> 02:06:40,057
lsn't it enough? Think & say.

1536
02:06:42,494 --> 02:06:45,759
There's nothing to think,
l want money.

1537
02:07:09,788 --> 02:07:10,413
Sister.

1538
02:08:05,844 --> 02:08:06,469
Stop it please.

1539
02:08:08,514 --> 02:08:10,641
In this race, Injimuda people's,

1540
02:08:10,849 --> 02:08:16,310
Bet is, 1000 acres of land....
200 bulls....100 milch cows.

1541
02:08:16,855 --> 02:08:21,986
lf Madambi people lose, they've to give
their entire property & leave the place.

1542
02:08:22,461 --> 02:08:24,827
lf you're ready, announce it.

1543
02:08:25,030 --> 02:08:26,657
Manickam is my cart man.

1544
02:08:40,546 --> 02:08:41,672
l'm ready to take up the bet.

1545
02:08:41,880 --> 02:08:44,849
Not only that, if
Madambi people lose,

1546
02:08:45,050 --> 02:08:48,850
l'll shave my sister's head,
make her sit on the donkey,

1547
02:08:49,054 --> 02:08:49,850
And take her around the village.

1548
02:08:52,958 --> 02:08:54,016
Only then l'll leave this place.

1549
02:08:57,730 --> 02:09:02,190
Appakalai is my cart man.
Lets begin.

1550
02:09:02,401 --> 02:09:03,197
Begin...

1551
02:09:05,904 --> 02:09:16,872
Manickam get into the cart.
- No, l can't....

1552
02:09:17,082 --> 02:09:20,882
Reason... - l feel giddy.

1553
02:09:21,086 --> 02:09:23,554
No problem...It's just a
matter of 5 minutes.

1554
02:09:23,756 --> 02:09:27,385
l can bear it even if you
join the race and lose.

1555
02:09:27,593 --> 02:09:31,051
l'll not lose if l join the race.
l very well know that.

1556
02:09:31,430 --> 02:09:33,057
That's why, l told you that
l'll not get into the cart.

1557
02:09:33,799 --> 02:09:37,235
Let anybody say anything...
l've not been ungrateful till now,

1558
02:09:37,436 --> 02:09:41,566
And l'll not be...Please forgive me.

1559
02:09:41,807 --> 02:09:45,243
You cheat...Treacherous fellow.
You've cheated me.

1560
02:09:45,811 --> 02:09:48,245
You men should keep up
your words.

1561
02:09:48,447 --> 02:09:50,244
l'll not leave you so easily.

1562
02:09:50,449 --> 02:09:54,579
On the next panchayat,
l'll throw you out from this place.

1563
02:10:09,368 --> 02:10:12,098
l've the money in my pocket which l've
got by selling his father.

1564
02:10:12,638 --> 02:10:16,096
ls he trying to defeat me?
ls he laying a bet with me?

1565
02:10:16,308 --> 02:10:21,940
l glossed & lived for these many days
by creating new bets daily & winning.

1566
02:10:22,514 --> 02:10:23,947
Did you see how l pulled his leg?

1567
02:10:24,650 --> 02:10:25,947
Didn't you see him
falling down there?

1568
02:10:28,987 --> 02:10:30,784
lf you hadn't stopped him
from the race.

1569
02:10:31,056 --> 02:10:32,455
l would've defeated him.

1570
02:10:34,159 --> 02:10:35,956
Yuck...You'll do it! Go man...

1571
02:10:36,829 --> 02:10:41,289
ls there any man in this world
who can beat him in this?

1572
02:10:43,402 --> 02:10:44,960
lf he had joined the race,

1573
02:10:45,170 --> 02:10:49,630
By this time, we would've had to give
away everything & leave this place.

1574
02:10:49,842 --> 02:10:52,970
Do you know?- So you know that.

1575
02:10:54,346 --> 02:10:59,147
He could've performed his sister's marriage
by selling this house if he wanted.

1576
02:10:59,351 --> 02:11:02,650
Just because he's loyal to us,
he didn't do like that.

1577
02:11:03,222 --> 02:11:06,680
Our family wasn't cursed
by anybody so far.

1578
02:11:07,226 --> 02:11:11,322
Now you don't get the curse.
You've to perform that marriage.

1579
02:11:12,030 --> 02:11:15,830
l told you whatever l wanted to.
Hereafter you do as you like.

1580
02:11:25,911 --> 02:11:29,005
You go & ask that Kannaiyan
to come here.

1581
02:11:31,550 --> 02:11:36,681
Don't think l'm giving up.
l wanted to win again.

1582
02:11:39,057 --> 02:11:40,854
It's good that Lord agreed.

1583
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:45,189
Now we needn't beg with anybody
& perform it, right?

1584
02:11:45,397 --> 02:11:49,026
You didn't hear the complete thing.
First hear & then say we need this or not.

1585
02:11:49,568 --> 02:11:50,364
What's it father?

1586
02:11:51,069 --> 02:11:53,367
My heart is beating fast...
How can l tell you?

1587
02:11:53,572 --> 02:11:54,197
l'll tell you.

1588
02:11:54,406 --> 02:11:59,207
Lord has ordered that marriage will
be performed only if you don't come.

1589
02:12:00,579 --> 02:12:05,710
Father... - l've promised him
that you'll not come.

1590
02:12:06,919 --> 02:12:08,546
We've to perform it somehow,
haven't we, son?

1591
02:12:08,754 --> 02:12:12,713
No need...What sin have l committed
to suffer so much?

1592
02:12:12,925 --> 02:12:17,385
Father who has brought up a grown up
motherless daughter,

1593
02:12:17,596 --> 02:12:20,565
You'll not understand that father's
feelings. That's why, l agreed.

1594
02:12:21,934 --> 02:12:23,902
l don't want a marriage
without you.

1595
02:12:24,102 --> 02:12:26,570
l'll be there...You don't cry.

1596
02:12:27,773 --> 02:12:31,732
My heart & blessings will
always be with you, dear.

1597
02:12:32,277 --> 02:12:36,577
l've fixed this marriage proposal.
It shouldn't stop because of me.

1598
02:12:37,649 --> 02:12:39,913
Atleast for our father,
you've to agree to this.

1599
02:12:40,786 --> 02:12:42,413
Offer him this money.

1600
02:12:52,998 --> 02:12:55,762
l'll meet you and the groom later.

1601
02:12:57,302 --> 02:12:58,269
You go.

1602
02:13:17,990 --> 02:13:20,788
l've served supper...
Sister has gone to bed.

1603
02:13:23,362 --> 02:13:25,125
Who'll feel hungry at
this miserable time?

1604
02:13:26,164 --> 02:13:28,462
l didn't join the feast even
though l attended the marriage.

1605
02:13:29,001 --> 02:13:32,129
l & Manickam should've had that
feast on the same leaf.

1606
02:13:32,904 --> 02:13:33,962
He may be angry with me.

1607
02:13:34,172 --> 02:13:36,970
But what to comment when he didn't
come for his sister's marriage.

1608
02:13:39,177 --> 02:13:42,305
l don't understand even now
how he became so venomous.

1609
02:13:45,017 --> 02:13:45,813
Wait....

1610
02:13:48,020 --> 02:13:49,817
My sister has a wish.

1611
02:13:50,689 --> 02:13:55,319
She didn't tell you because she
was hesitant to tell you directly.

1612
02:13:56,862 --> 02:13:58,489
Let anything happen,
you be here.

1613
02:13:59,931 --> 02:14:05,665
But sister's wish is that you should
stay here as the member of this family.

1614
02:14:07,205 --> 02:14:09,332
l don't get you.

1615
02:14:11,743 --> 02:14:15,509
l'm also fed up living alone.

1616
02:14:16,048 --> 02:14:20,849
l've received many proposals
from well off families.

1617
02:14:21,386 --> 02:14:25,186
But l'm not interested
in money & fame.

1618
02:14:25,957 --> 02:14:29,188
l want a girl who'll understand &
look after me.

1619
02:14:29,394 --> 02:14:30,691
Only that's needed, right?

1620
02:14:31,229 --> 02:14:39,034
So you... - No...l've committed sins.

1621
02:14:39,971 --> 02:14:43,372
Even the people who want to help me are
in no position to do it

1622
02:14:43,975 --> 02:14:45,374
l don't feel so.

1623
02:14:45,911 --> 02:14:47,708
l'm going to fix and declare
this immediately.

1624
02:15:11,103 --> 02:15:14,072
lsn't the boss there? - Who're you?
l don't recognise you.

1625
02:15:14,272 --> 02:15:15,899
Ask him...He'll tell you.

1626
02:15:22,114 --> 02:15:22,739
What?

1627
02:15:28,286 --> 02:15:32,086
l came to see the groom.
l've brought a gift.

1628
02:15:32,958 --> 02:15:37,759
l made these ornaments
for our marriage.

1629
02:15:38,630 --> 02:15:40,257
l heard that you're
going to marry someone else.

1630
02:15:40,799 --> 02:15:44,428
When you give her the jewels and saree,
give her even this.

1631
02:15:45,704 --> 02:15:48,764
For some years he was
romancing with me.

1632
02:15:49,040 --> 02:15:50,439
At that time when he said that he
doesn't want marriage,

1633
02:15:50,642 --> 02:15:52,610
And he's going to live for
his sister,

1634
02:15:52,811 --> 02:15:55,279
l didn't cry and fall at his feet.

1635
02:15:55,480 --> 02:15:56,447
l was just waiting for him.

1636
02:15:57,649 --> 02:16:01,949
l prayed to all the Gods that
he should change his mind.

1637
02:16:03,054 --> 02:16:07,787
Till now l didn't think of
another man or to lead a family.

1638
02:16:09,528 --> 02:16:13,294
Now when he saw the beauty of the girl
who's like his daughter,

1639
02:16:13,532 --> 02:16:15,124
He forgot me.

1640
02:16:16,501 --> 02:16:19,299
l've teased you and sang
that you're a stone hearted man.

1641
02:16:20,071 --> 02:16:24,633
But if you had a pebble sized heart,
you would've remembered me.

1642
02:16:27,078 --> 02:16:31,811
l hate myself for loving you
all these years.

1643
02:16:42,527 --> 02:16:46,987
That's good...Even you're involved
in grabbing, right? - What's it?

1644
02:16:47,199 --> 02:16:51,499
Oh god! Pregnant women should be very
careful for first 3 months.

1645
02:16:51,703 --> 02:16:53,170
Shouldn't do these type of jobs.

1646
02:16:53,705 --> 02:16:56,003
lf you had learnt to steal,
you've to be cautious.

1647
02:16:56,208 --> 02:16:59,006
lf anybody sees now, cat'll be
out of the bag.

1648
02:16:59,377 --> 02:17:03,006
lf it does, even your head'll be
shaved and you'll be taken on a donkey.

1649
02:17:03,448 --> 02:17:06,713
It will be awkward scene
hey, going away!

1650
02:17:08,887 --> 02:17:12,687
When in love...Girls really
behave like kids.

1651
02:17:13,225 --> 02:17:14,852
Some don't get what they wish for.

1652
02:17:15,393 --> 02:17:16,360
So they'll grab it when they
don't get it.

1653
02:17:16,561 --> 02:17:18,859
While grabbing they'll slip.

1654
02:17:19,064 --> 02:17:21,362
And make a mess of everything.

1655
02:17:23,068 --> 02:17:27,368
Atleast now tell me, who told you that
by lying you can marry me?

1656
02:17:30,242 --> 02:17:31,368
Who made you say lie?

1657
02:17:38,817 --> 02:17:39,374
Thief!

1658
02:17:52,297 --> 02:17:53,559
Thief...

1659
02:17:55,433 --> 02:17:56,559
Cuckoo...Cuckoo...

1660
02:17:58,603 --> 02:18:00,230
Thief...Thief.

1661
02:18:02,607 --> 02:18:10,742
Oh thief cuckoo...Will you tell it softly
and sweetly in my ears?

1662
02:18:23,295 --> 02:18:30,428
That day you laid
eggs in the crow's nest,

1663
02:18:31,303 --> 02:18:34,602
And flew away singing
that you didn't.

1664
02:18:34,806 --> 02:18:37,775
Why did you lie?

1665
02:19:23,355 --> 02:19:34,493
Even wind is endorsing that those
are crow's eggs.

1666
02:19:35,367 --> 02:19:41,499
Nobody believed the crow when it told the
truth, opened its heart and showed.

1667
02:19:42,207 --> 02:19:46,667
Then it swooned and lay in the nest.

1668
02:19:47,545 --> 02:19:54,678
Who's standing at the distance?

1669
02:19:55,553 --> 02:20:01,856
Tiny branch of the banyan tree
is swaying merrily.

1670
02:20:45,603 --> 02:20:51,906
When the temple dones flew and
cooed all over the village.

1671
02:20:52,110 --> 02:20:56,410
Gossip spread like wild fire.

1672
02:20:57,615 --> 02:21:08,753
Parrot which loved the crow didn't
know the true story.

1673
02:21:09,627 --> 02:21:16,760
Breeze is flowing in this garden.

1674
02:21:17,635 --> 02:21:24,097
My dear bird smiled
by flapping it's wings.

1675
02:22:43,221 --> 02:22:46,850
In the Srihalli fair, have you seen the
bull fixed by the Surya family.

1676
02:22:50,562 --> 02:22:52,359
l've not brought it for sale.

1677
02:22:52,597 --> 02:22:55,532
Those who have not seen
the good ones can have a look.

1678
02:22:55,733 --> 02:22:58,861
l didn't sell it even after they
promised to give me gold.

1679
02:23:00,905 --> 02:23:04,864
No... -Go man.

1680
02:23:05,076 --> 02:23:06,873
What a man he's?

1681
02:23:08,580 --> 02:23:12,380
Look at the bull, count its
teeth and then fix the deal.

1682
02:23:18,089 --> 02:23:20,717
Those who've lot of money
can bid.

1683
02:23:20,925 --> 02:23:24,053
Did you see the people
yelling in the hot sun?

1684
02:23:24,262 --> 02:23:29,393
He was strong and heaIthy when he
was in my house with 3 square meals.

1685
02:23:29,634 --> 02:23:31,397
Now did you see him, how
lean and dark he has become?

1686
02:23:31,769 --> 02:23:33,396
He'll suffer like this if
he doesn't behave decently.

1687
02:23:33,605 --> 02:23:37,405
Hereafter you'll see him roaming
as a beggar, in this fair.

1688
02:23:38,109 --> 02:23:41,909
Did you see the bulls shining?
- He made them shine by applying oil.

1689
02:23:42,113 --> 02:23:44,240
They'll faint and fall if they
take 4 steps forward.

1690
02:23:46,317 --> 02:23:50,913
Lord...Don't trouble me,
let me somehow live.

1691
02:23:51,122 --> 02:23:52,248
l'll trouble you.

1692
02:23:52,991 --> 02:23:56,757
Trapping women in my house after
eating my food.

1693
02:23:56,961 --> 02:23:59,429
These are not enough for
dirty creeps like you.

1694
02:23:59,797 --> 02:24:03,756
Who knows that he'll not trap even
my sister whom he calls his mother?

1695
02:24:08,640 --> 02:24:15,773
l'll kill you if you
talk nonsense.

1696
02:24:50,682 --> 02:24:52,479
Where's he?

1697
02:24:54,452 --> 02:24:56,647
That person with the saffron paste
on his forehead.

1698
02:25:07,198 --> 02:25:10,167
Hey dog's progeny, you'll marry
my girl, won't you?

1699
02:25:10,902 --> 02:25:13,871
Your corpse will only marry her.

1700
02:25:15,740 --> 02:25:19,176
l've warned him already.

1701
02:25:29,554 --> 02:25:31,852
Please come...They're hitting our Lord.

1702
02:29:11,676 --> 02:29:12,643
Take him and go.

1703
02:29:13,511 --> 02:29:15,979
He might be a Policeman there,
but here he's nothing.

1704
02:29:16,347 --> 02:29:17,644
This is a different State.

1705
02:29:17,848 --> 02:29:20,646
Warn him that he'll lose his limbs
if he comes here again.

1706
02:29:36,901 --> 02:29:38,698
Where are you going?
-l'm going!

1707
02:29:40,538 --> 02:29:44,497
Only now l've understood that
l've not committed a big sin.

1708
02:29:45,009 --> 02:29:47,637
Orelse if at the end of this night,

1709
02:29:47,845 --> 02:29:52,305
My life would've been hell,
after marrying you, you cheat.

1710
02:29:53,684 --> 02:29:54,742
Kuyili told me everything.

1711
02:29:55,453 --> 02:30:02,757
Do you want to know anything else?
l want to tell you some more.

1712
02:30:02,960 --> 02:30:09,923
www.bibzworld.co.in

1713
02:30:10,134 --> 02:30:11,601
So l'm not saying anything.

1714
02:30:22,913 --> 02:30:25,381
Go...All of you dogs...go.

1715
02:30:25,916 --> 02:30:27,383
But this Srikrishnan'll not lose.

1716
02:30:27,918 --> 02:30:29,044
You people are nothing to me.

1717
02:30:29,754 --> 02:30:32,552
Nobody'll live happily after
hurting me.

1718
02:30:32,923 --> 02:30:36,051
l'll teach a lesson to
all of you, go...

1719
02:30:51,175 --> 02:30:51,903
It's enough man.

1720
02:30:53,444 --> 02:30:55,071
Let all those who
want to go, go.

1721
02:30:56,781 --> 02:30:58,078
Am l not there for you?

1722
02:30:59,617 --> 02:31:01,346
Forget everything dear.

1723
02:32:02,947 --> 02:32:03,811
Where are you going?

1724
02:32:04,014 --> 02:32:06,915
l want to meet that beggar.

1725
02:32:09,620 --> 02:32:10,587
Stay there.

1726
02:32:49,660 --> 02:32:59,797
Come...

1727
02:33:00,337 --> 02:33:01,804
Many have died here.

1728
02:33:02,006 --> 02:33:04,474
Only plants are here...
even corpses will not be found.

1729
02:33:18,689 --> 02:33:19,485
He killed the Lord.

1730
02:33:20,357 --> 02:33:26,489
And threw him in the pond
to get that girl.

1731
02:33:57,461 --> 02:33:58,428
You killed him, right?

1732
02:33:58,796 --> 02:34:02,095
You killed my Lord for a dirty
girl right? - Father.

1733
02:34:03,801 --> 02:34:04,927
No, father....

1734
02:34:05,135 --> 02:34:07,603
No...Didn't you hit him
in this fair?

1735
02:34:08,072 --> 02:34:09,596
Didn't you say that
you'll kill him?

1736
02:34:09,807 --> 02:34:13,607
My heart cried when l saw his
sister crying.

1737
02:34:14,311 --> 02:34:19,112
You'll be ruined, you ungrateful dog.
- Are you a human being?

1738
02:34:19,483 --> 02:34:21,110
You're making your father to cry.

1739
02:34:21,318 --> 02:34:24,287
Yes...It's a heart-rending sight, isn't it?

1740
02:35:01,191 --> 02:35:04,752
l didn't think that you'll kill him
when you threatened to.

1741
02:35:06,030 --> 02:35:07,998
But you did as you said.

1742
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:11,997
Please listen to what l
want to say.

1743
02:35:12,536 --> 02:35:15,334
l know he was very vile.

1744
02:35:16,040 --> 02:35:18,008
He was very cruel to you.

1745
02:35:18,208 --> 02:35:23,339
Even then, didn't l bring you both together
and fed rice from the same pot.

1746
02:35:24,481 --> 02:35:26,381
How could you think
of doing this?

1747
02:35:28,886 --> 02:35:35,519
Atleast you should believe me. -No
everything is over now...

1748
02:35:36,894 --> 02:35:38,020
It'll be good if l know one thing.

1749
02:35:38,729 --> 02:35:41,926
ls his corpse in the pond or have
you buried him somewhere?

1750
02:35:43,167 --> 02:35:47,194
So that l can get
a handful of his ashes to perform the rites.

1751
02:35:48,405 --> 02:35:51,704
Let his soul atleast rest in peace
-Mother.

1752
02:35:53,911 --> 02:35:54,639
Mother.

1753
02:35:56,914 --> 02:35:58,040
l didn't throw.

1754
02:35:59,917 --> 02:36:01,282
l didn't do it.

1755
02:36:02,920 --> 02:36:04,387
l didn't kill him.

1756
02:36:09,827 --> 02:36:17,131
Oh my god! How can l make her believe?

1757
02:36:29,613 --> 02:36:32,081
No time to think. Do something immediately.

1758
02:36:33,951 --> 02:36:34,918
l'll sent a person right now.

1759
02:36:35,119 --> 02:36:38,088
We've to call the police from the town
or else he'll leave this place.

1760
02:36:47,464 --> 02:36:48,431
Brother.

1761
02:36:50,968 --> 02:36:53,095
l'm going -Where?

1762
02:36:54,071 --> 02:36:55,766
l'll get into the 10'clock bus.

1763
02:36:56,774 --> 02:36:59,470
l'll get down at the terminus and
walk from there.

1764
02:37:01,478 --> 02:37:02,672
l've thought only that much now.

1765
02:37:04,815 --> 02:37:05,645
l'm unable to bear it.

1766
02:37:07,151 --> 02:37:11,281
l'm unable to bear the punishment
for the crime which l've not committed.

1767
02:37:23,934 --> 02:37:26,402
Now if l come with you
l'll not trouble you.

1768
02:37:28,105 --> 02:37:29,231
l'll get down on the way.

1769
02:37:48,625 --> 02:37:52,083
Uncle...Manickam and that girl
are leaving this place.

1770
02:37:52,296 --> 02:37:54,594
We'll not be able to catch him if he
leaves by 10'clock bus, come.

1771
02:38:10,047 --> 02:38:12,845
l thought of meeting you
before l left.

1772
02:38:13,717 --> 02:38:17,118
Hey dog, you're broadcasting everywhere
that l've killed him, aren't you?

1773
02:39:19,449 --> 02:39:21,917
Tell me...Who killed the Lord?
-No.

1774
02:39:22,119 --> 02:39:24,087
Where's Lord? -l don't know.

1775
02:39:24,288 --> 02:39:26,586
Tell me, where's the Lord?

1776
02:39:28,959 --> 02:39:30,426
Catch him, man.

1777
02:40:35,859 --> 02:40:37,349
Come fast.

1778
02:41:42,192 --> 02:41:45,559
Didn't you die?
- Die? Why?

1779
02:41:49,199 --> 02:41:52,828
My son...We shouldn't live with
the girl whom we like.

1780
02:41:53,203 --> 02:41:56,001
But should live with
the girl who likes us.

1781
02:41:56,540 --> 02:42:00,169
This is the lesson l've learnt
from the nonsense l did.

1782
02:42:16,393 --> 02:42:17,690
Please bless us.

1783
02:42:21,898 --> 02:42:23,195
You come this side and stand.

1784
02:42:24,735 --> 02:42:25,360
Why?

1785
02:42:25,836 --> 02:42:27,599
Let me see you clearly.

1786
02:42:40,484 --> 02:42:46,616
Please pardon me. All have
troubled you alot isn't it?

1787
02:42:48,325 --> 02:42:49,292
Pardon me.

1788
02:42:50,660 --> 02:42:51,786
Mother, you don't say like that.

1789
02:42:52,796 --> 02:42:54,525
Brother has come alive, hasn't he?

1790
02:42:55,398 --> 02:42:56,865
But l've only regret.

1791
02:42:57,734 --> 02:43:01,534
You believed when somebody said
that l killed him.

1792
02:43:02,472 --> 02:43:03,370
You killed me?

1793
02:43:04,407 --> 02:43:05,874
Which bastard said this?

1794
02:43:07,744 --> 02:43:08,369
He only.

1795
02:43:14,017 --> 02:43:15,712
Catch him.

1796
02:43:21,758 --> 02:43:22,782
Make him stand here.

1797
02:43:24,427 --> 02:43:25,553
Did you say like that?

1798
02:43:27,864 --> 02:43:29,331
Lord, tell us what to do with him.

1799
02:43:29,533 --> 02:43:30,500
Shall we throw him in the pond?

1800
02:43:30,700 --> 02:43:32,429
He has do situps here.

1801
02:43:32,636 --> 02:43:36,504
You made me a killer by throwing his
slippers & upper cloth in the pond?

1802
02:43:36,706 --> 02:43:37,673
Pardon me.

1803
02:43:37,874 --> 02:43:41,105
Do situps till it becomes dark and
the come there to bathe the cattles.

1804
02:43:41,311 --> 02:43:43,176
We'll tell you the rest of
the punishment at that time.

1805
02:43:43,880 --> 02:43:46,678
Nobody should give him water.
-We'll not give.

1806
02:43:46,883 --> 02:43:48,851
Hey do situps...count man.

1807
02:43:50,053 --> 02:43:52,180
1 - 1 .

1808
02:43:52,389 --> 02:43:54,857
2 - 2.

1809
02:43:55,058 --> 02:43:57,026
3 - 3.

1810
02:43:57,227 --> 02:43:59,195
4 - 4.

1811
02:43:59,563 --> 02:44:01,531
5 - 5.

1812
02:44:01,731 --> 02:44:03,358
6 - 6.

1813
02:44:03,567 --> 02:44:05,364
7 - 7.

1814
02:44:05,902 --> 02:44:14,037
lf the sky is clear and hearts are
contented, marriage is warranted.

1815
02:44:14,244 --> 02:44:18,203
Shyness'll swing my heart
