00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:25,735
<i>On the pages of American folklore,</i>

2
00:00:25,905 --> 00:00:29,784
<i>a legion of mighty men have left
the symbols of their greatness.</i>

3
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:31,617
<i>There was Paul Bunyan's axe.</i>

4
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:34,899
<i>John Henry's hammer.</i>

5
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:37,979
<i>Davy Crockett's rifle.</i>

6
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:41,661
<i>And then, quite unexpectedly,</i>

7
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:44,180
<i>one comes upon a tin-pot hat,</i>

8
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:48,054
<i>a bag of apple seed and a holy book.</i>

9
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:49,863
<i>And strangely enough,</i>

10
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:53,614
<i>these are the symbols
of one of the mightiest men of all.</i>

11
00:00:53,785 --> 00:00:56,697
<i>John Chapman, a real-life pioneer.</i>

12
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:01,854
<i>With the passing years, however,
reality has given way to legend.</i>

13
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:06,934
<i>Until today, we know this remarkable man
simply as Johnny Appleseed.</i>

14
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:12,259
<i>This is his story, told by an old settler
who knew Johnny well.</i>

15
00:01:12,425 --> 00:01:13,778
<i>Listen.</i>

16
00:01:13,945 --> 00:01:17,654
<i>Well, sir,
every time I see an apple-blossom sky,</i>

17
00:01:17,865 --> 00:01:19,503
<i>I think of Johnny Appleseed.</i>

18
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:22,095
<i>Because of course
them clouds up there,</i>

19
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:24,221
<i>they ain't really clouds at all.</i>

20
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:25,500
<i>No, sir.</i>

21
00:01:25,665 --> 00:01:28,054
<i>Why, there wouldn't be
no apple-blossom sky</i>

22
00:01:28,225 --> 00:01:30,739
<i>if it weren't for the fact that Johnny...</i>

23
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:32,861
<i>But, now, hold on here.</i>

24
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:36,057
<i>Guess I better start back
to the beginning.</i>

25
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:39,860
<i>And that's when Johnny lived on a farm
near Pittsburgh town.</i>

26
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:43,694
<i>The year was 1806
or maybe there around.</i>

27
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,464
<i>Now, just to look at him,</i>

28
00:01:45,665 --> 00:01:48,862
<i>you'd say Johnny Appleseed
never would make a pioneer.</i>

29
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:52,301
<i>He was such a sawed-off
scrawny little fella.</i>

30
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:55,138
<i>Of course, that didn't faze Johnny none.</i>

31
00:01:55,305 --> 00:01:57,773
<i>He had his apple trees
and the morning sun</i>

32
00:01:57,945 --> 00:02:00,300
<i>and the evening breeze.</i>

33
00:02:03,705 --> 00:02:06,094
<i>The Lord is good to me</i>

34
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:08,142
<i>And so I thank the Lord</i>

35
00:02:08,905 --> 00:02:11,465
<i>For giving me the things I need</i>

36
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,815
<i>The sun and rain and an apple seed</i>

37
00:02:13,985 --> 00:02:18,979
<i>Yes, he's been good to me</i>

38
00:02:21,465 --> 00:02:23,854
<i>I owe the Lord so much</i>

39
00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:26,585
<i>For everything I see</i>

40
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:28,895
<i>I'm certain if it weren't for him</i>

41
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:32,057
<i>There'd be no apples on this limb</i>

42
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:36,662
<i>He's been good to me</i>

43
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,459
<i>Oh, here am I
Neath the blue, blue sky</i>

44
00:02:39,665 --> 00:02:41,621
<i>A- doing as I please</i>

45
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:45,740
<i>Singin' with my feathered friend</i>

46
00:02:45,905 --> 00:02:50,057
<i>Hummin' with the bees</i>

47
00:02:50,265 --> 00:02:52,460
<i>I wake up every day</i>

48
00:02:52,665 --> 00:02:55,418
<i>As happy as can be</i>

49
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:57,860
<i>Because I know that with his care</i>

50
00:02:58,065 --> 00:03:00,260
<i>My apple trees, they will still be there</i>

51
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:05,220
<i>Oh, the Lord is good to me</i>

52
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:10,256
<i>Working, singing, carefree and gay,</i>

53
00:03:10,465 --> 00:03:13,059
<i>that's how Johnny spent each day</i>

54
00:03:13,265 --> 00:03:15,859
<i>attending to his apple trees.</i>

55
00:03:17,385 --> 00:03:22,015
<i>But lately, little Johnny here
would feel a stirring in the air.</i>

56
00:03:22,185 --> 00:03:26,383
<i>A rumbling, rolling under bead
of restless men and restless feet.</i>

57
00:03:26,545 --> 00:03:28,581
<i>There's plenty of room for you</i>

58
00:03:28,745 --> 00:03:30,861
<i>Get on the wagon rolling west</i>

59
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:32,583
<i>Out to the great unknown</i>

60
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,861
<i>Get on the wagon rolling west</i>

61
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:36,504
<i>Or you'll be left alone</i>

62
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:38,496
<i>We'd little hope before</i>

63
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:40,496
<i>We're starting out again</i>

64
00:03:40,665 --> 00:03:42,496
<i>We ain't afeard of man or beast</i>

65
00:03:42,665 --> 00:03:43,984
<i>We're strong-hearted men</i>

66
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:46,613
<i>So get on the wagon rolling west</i>

67
00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:48,662
<i>Seeking a land that's new</i>

68
00:03:48,865 --> 00:03:50,617
<i>Get on the wagon rolling west</i>

69
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:52,537
<i>There's plenty of room for you</i>

70
00:03:52,705 --> 00:03:54,616
<i>Get on the wagon rolling west</i>

71
00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:56,537
<i>Out to the great unknown</i>

72
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:58,582
<i>Get on the wagon rolling west</i>

73
00:03:58,745 --> 00:04:00,497
<i>Or you'll be left alone</i>

74
00:04:00,665 --> 00:04:02,656
<i>The rivers may be wide</i>

75
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,656
<i>The mountains may be tall</i>

76
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:06,736
<i>But nothing stops the pioneer</i>

77
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:08,418
<i>We're trailblazers all</i>

78
00:04:08,585 --> 00:04:10,735
<i>Oh, get on the wagon rolling west</i>

79
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:12,782
<i>Out to the great unknown</i>

80
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:14,901
<i>Get on the wagon rolling west or...</i>

81
00:04:15,065 --> 00:04:16,657
<i>You'll be left alone</i>

82
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:18,583
<i>You'll be left alone</i>

83
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:20,417
<i>Poor Johnny.</i>

84
00:04:20,585 --> 00:04:23,145
<i>He weren't no pioneer
and he knowed it.</i>

85
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,819
<i>It was all just pretend.</i>

86
00:04:25,985 --> 00:04:28,215
<i>And them folks going west
to build this nation</i>

87
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:32,583
<i>sure made picking apples
look like a plum useless occupation.</i>

88
00:04:33,865 --> 00:04:37,380
<i>Well, sir,
that's when a miracle happened.</i>

89
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:40,298
Well, what's holding you, Johnny?

90
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:41,580
<i>Says a voice.</i>

91
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:46,057
Go on. Go on out west
if that's your choice.

92
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:54,697
<i>Well, sir, it was a angel.</i>

93
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:58,062
<i>Johnny's own private guardian angel.</i>

94
00:04:58,225 --> 00:05:01,183
<i>Might look mighty queersome
to you and me,</i>

95
00:05:01,345 --> 00:05:05,543
<i>but you know, that's just the way
John figured he'd be.</i>

96
00:05:05,945 --> 00:05:08,584
Well, speak up, boy.

97
00:05:08,745 --> 00:05:10,463
Don't stand there gawking.

98
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,741
Unlock your jaw and get to talking.

99
00:05:12,905 --> 00:05:14,020
Yes, sir.

100
00:05:14,185 --> 00:05:16,141
Yes, sir.

101
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:19,225
Why don't I go west?

102
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,740
Because I ain't got the muscle

103
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,782
or the breadth of chest.

104
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:27,096
Out there it's the strong men
who's surviving.

105
00:05:27,265 --> 00:05:29,938
I'm about the puniest fella alive.

106
00:05:32,185 --> 00:05:35,416
Shame to you, Johnny.

107
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:40,619
You got faith and courage
and a level head.

108
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:44,059
But you see, sir,

109
00:05:44,265 --> 00:05:47,257
all I know is apple trees.

110
00:05:47,465 --> 00:05:50,457
And what's wrong with apples,
if you please?

111
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,980
Ain't they about the finest fruit
in all the land?

112
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:56,296
Why... Why, shoot, man,
they take the cake.

113
00:05:56,465 --> 00:06:00,822
Just think, Johnny,
of all the things that apples make.

114
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,499
There's apple pickles.

115
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:05,815
<i>Oh-so-tasty apple tarts</i>

116
00:06:05,985 --> 00:06:09,057
<i>And apple pastry, apple dumplings
Not to mention...</i>

117
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:10,499
- Apple sauce?
- Yes.

118
00:06:10,665 --> 00:06:12,974
<i>And there's apple fritters, light as thistle</i>

119
00:06:13,145 --> 00:06:14,464
<i>And for folks to wet their whistle</i>

120
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:18,578
<i>- Tangy apple cider in a glass
- Tangy apple cider in a glass</i>

121
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,815
<i>Stew 'em, fry 'em, boil 'em, pick 'em</i>

122
00:06:20,985 --> 00:06:23,180
- Apple-pie and apple-cake them.
- Yep.

123
00:06:23,345 --> 00:06:26,018
<i>You can cook 'em many ways</i>

124
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,779
<i>There's apple this and apple that</i>

125
00:06:28,945 --> 00:06:30,583
<i>The recipes'd fill your hat</i>

126
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:34,533
<i>Why, I could carry on like this all day</i>

127
00:06:34,705 --> 00:06:38,220
<i>So pack your stuff and get a-going</i>

128
00:06:38,385 --> 00:06:40,262
<i>Get them apple trees a-growing</i>

129
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:43,775
<i>There's a lot of work out there to do</i>

130
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:48,453
<i>- There's a lot of work to do
- There's a lot of work to do</i>

131
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:50,018
Yes, sir.

132
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:51,664
I mean, no, sir.

133
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:55,579
You see, sir, I ain't got the traps,
ain't got the gear.

134
00:06:55,745 --> 00:06:57,622
Or none of the things I'll need out there.

135
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,264
You ain't got the...

136
00:06:59,465 --> 00:07:03,458
Dad gummit, boy. I'm ashamed of you.

137
00:07:04,145 --> 00:07:06,261
You got the stuff to see you through.

138
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,617
Why, you got all the seeds
you're needing.

139
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:12,334
And for pretty darn good reading...

140
00:07:12,505 --> 00:07:16,100
<i>There ain't nothing finer than your book</i>

141
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:18,973
Here's a mighty handy bonnet.

142
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:21,022
Even got a handle on it.

143
00:07:21,185 --> 00:07:24,302
<i>Turn it upside down and you can cook</i>

144
00:07:24,465 --> 00:07:27,104
<i>So come on, son, and get a-going</i>

145
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:29,017
<i>Get them apple trees a-growing</i>

146
00:07:29,185 --> 00:07:32,302
<i>- There's a lot of work out there to do
- There's a lot of work out there to do</i>

147
00:07:32,465 --> 00:07:37,095
<i>- Oh, there's a lot of work to do
- Oh, there's a lot of work to do</i>

148
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:43,542
<i>Well, sir, that's how it all began.</i>

149
00:07:43,705 --> 00:07:48,984
<i>That's how Johnny, all alone,
set out to meet the great unknown.</i>

150
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:56,541
<i>It was a mighty big and fearsome place
for a man to face.</i>

151
00:08:22,465 --> 00:08:25,184
<i>A little man and all alone,</i>

152
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:28,815
<i>without no knife, without no gun.</i>

153
00:08:28,985 --> 00:08:31,215
<i>And though the forest is dark and wide</i>

154
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:34,019
<i>with fearsome critters on every side,</i>

155
00:08:34,185 --> 00:08:36,904
<i>Johnny just kept walking on.</i>

156
00:08:40,705 --> 00:08:44,380
<i>Walked until at last he found
a little spot of open ground</i>

157
00:08:44,545 --> 00:08:48,140
<i>with fertile soil and warmsome breeze.</i>

158
00:08:48,305 --> 00:08:51,661
<i>A likely place for apple trees.</i>

159
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,293
<i>Now, the varmints here,
they couldn't know</i>

160
00:08:56,465 --> 00:08:58,979
<i>if John was friend or John was foe.</i>

161
00:08:59,145 --> 00:09:01,818
<i>So some took off in sudden flight.</i>

162
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:07,496
<i>And some got set to claw and bite.</i>

163
00:09:09,145 --> 00:09:12,057
<i>But if Johnny seen him,
he paid no heed.</i>

164
00:09:12,225 --> 00:09:15,774
<i>Just got busy planting apple seed.</i>

165
00:09:30,225 --> 00:09:32,455
<i>Now, them varmints
come from everywhere,</i>

166
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:35,455
<i>watched that man a-digging there.</i>

167
00:09:35,665 --> 00:09:37,781
<i>Didn't like what they were seeing.</i>

168
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:41,017
<i>Didn't trust no human being.</i>

169
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,458
<i>Yep, that ornery human had to go.</i>

170
00:09:53,065 --> 00:09:55,260
<i>But who was a-gonna tell him so?</i>

171
00:09:55,465 --> 00:09:58,696
<i>Well, not a soul could answer that</i>

172
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:02,301
<i>till here come along
a black and white cat.</i>

173
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:06,501
<i>Now, he weren't too bright,
but he didn't much care.</i>

174
00:10:06,665 --> 00:10:09,862
<i>He knowed he had a certain air</i>

175
00:10:10,065 --> 00:10:11,384
<i>about.</i>

176
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:20,862
<i>Well, sir, that done it.</i>

177
00:11:24,345 --> 00:11:26,779
<i>The critters ne'er see the be to that:</i>

178
00:11:26,945 --> 00:11:30,255
<i>The likes of a human a-liking that cat.</i>

179
00:11:30,465 --> 00:11:35,414
<i>Why, this little man
had went and busted every precedent.</i>

180
00:11:35,585 --> 00:11:37,462
<i>He was the very first to come</i>

181
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:42,019
<i>without no knife, without no gun.</i>

182
00:11:44,225 --> 00:11:46,944
<i>And so it was from that time on,</i>

183
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:50,984
<i>every last living varmint
was a friend to John.</i>

184
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:53,864
<i>They surely was.</i>

185
00:11:54,425 --> 00:11:56,939
<i>The Lord is good to me</i>

186
00:11:57,105 --> 00:11:59,824
<i>And so I thank the Lord</i>

187
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,704
<i>For giving me the things I need</i>

188
00:12:02,865 --> 00:12:05,174
<i>The sun and rain and an apple seed</i>

189
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:09,657
<i>And he's been good to me</i>

190
00:12:21,065 --> 00:12:22,862
<i>Well, as time went by,</i>

191
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:25,823
<i>Johnny kept right on
a- planting his apple trees</i>

192
00:12:25,985 --> 00:12:28,624
<i>and making friends everywhere.</i>

193
00:12:28,785 --> 00:12:31,060
<i>And his best friend was the pioneers.</i>

194
00:12:31,225 --> 00:12:34,615
<i>For, of course, John was planting
more than an apple tree.</i>

195
00:12:34,785 --> 00:12:38,903
<i>He was planting his own boundless faith
and courage too.</i>

196
00:12:39,065 --> 00:12:40,817
<i>And that give folks new heart,</i>

197
00:12:40,985 --> 00:12:44,102
<i>new hope in the job they had to do.</i>

198
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:51,219
<i>And as more and more pioneers
come to push back the forest,</i>

199
00:12:51,425 --> 00:12:54,223
<i>the kindly deeds
of little Johnny Appleseed</i>

200
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:56,893
<i>spread throughout the land.</i>

201
00:12:57,065 --> 00:12:59,977
<i>And more than once
with a good old-fashioned jubilee</i>

202
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:02,579
<i>folks would honour Johnny Appleseed</i>

203
00:13:02,745 --> 00:13:05,339
<i>and the fruit of the apple tree.</i>

204
00:13:37,545 --> 00:13:40,537
<i>Now, sometimes
if John was a-passing by,</i>

205
00:13:40,705 --> 00:13:43,219
<i>he'd mosey over
and kind of look in on the doings.</i>

206
00:13:43,385 --> 00:13:46,616
<i>Because it sure tickled him
to see how the fruit of his labours</i>

207
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:50,061
<i>brought all kinds of folks together
and made them good neighbours.</i>

208
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,303
Come and get it.

209
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:31,218
The food is on the table set.
It's all a-waiting to be eat.

210
00:14:31,385 --> 00:14:32,864
Come and get it.

211
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:44,696
- Apple pickles.
- Mighty tasty.

212
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:46,856
- Apple butter.
- Apple pastry.

213
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:49,659
- Apple dumpling.
- How'd you like some applesauce?

214
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:51,144
Yes, ma'am.

215
00:14:51,305 --> 00:14:55,139
<i>Yep, Johnny did bring folks
a heap of happiness.</i>

216
00:14:55,305 --> 00:14:57,500
<i>But he weren't looking for thanks.</i>

217
00:14:57,665 --> 00:14:59,860
<i>Didn't have time for it.</i>

218
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,579
<i>He knowed a man can take no rest</i>

219
00:15:02,745 --> 00:15:05,418
<i>if he aims to plant
the whole darn wilderness</i>

220
00:15:05,585 --> 00:15:07,541
<i>in apple trees.</i>

221
00:15:10,545 --> 00:15:13,264
<i>And so it was for more than 40 year</i>

222
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:17,060
<i>John walked and planted
that old frontier.</i>

223
00:15:25,505 --> 00:15:29,259
<i>Yes, sir,
40 years of walking and planting.</i>

224
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:32,263
<i>And in that space of two-score year</i>

225
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:33,693
<i>this little man,</i>

226
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:37,255
<i>he throwed his shadow
clear across the land</i>

227
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:41,583
<i>across a hundred thousand
miles square.</i>

228
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:48,339
<i>And in that shadow everywhere,</i>

229
00:15:48,505 --> 00:15:52,214
<i>you'll find he left his blessings three:</i>

230
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:57,418
<i>Love and faith</i>

231
00:15:57,585 --> 00:16:02,659
<i>And the apple tree</i>

232
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:09,894
Boy, for sleeping you take the cake.

233
00:16:10,465 --> 00:16:12,262
Come on, get up.

234
00:16:12,825 --> 00:16:14,656
We got a longsome trip to make.

235
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:18,215
Oh, why, Mr. Angel. How do you do?

236
00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:21,064
I'm fine. And how be you?

237
00:16:21,225 --> 00:16:23,500
I'm fine. Just feeling...

238
00:16:27,545 --> 00:16:30,855
Who is that
sleeping in the evening dusk?

239
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:34,062
Why, that's just your husk, John.
Your mortal husk.

240
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:35,419
My husk?

241
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:38,376
You mean to say I'm...?

242
00:16:38,545 --> 00:16:40,854
I'm passed away?

243
00:16:41,745 --> 00:16:44,737
Dagnabbit, angel. I just can't go.

244
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:46,782
Got crops to harvest, seeds to sow.

245
00:16:46,945 --> 00:16:50,062
Now, now, now. Hold on, boy.

246
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,741
Down here on Earth,
your work is through.

247
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:54,858
But yonder?

248
00:16:55,065 --> 00:16:57,215
Well, we need you, Johnny.

249
00:16:57,385 --> 00:16:59,421
Yep, we sure do.

250
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:03,858
You think we had most all we please,

251
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,783
but we ain't.

252
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:09,535
We're kind of short on apple trees.

253
00:17:10,665 --> 00:17:14,817
Well, I swan. I didn't know.

254
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:18,136
What are we waiting for?
Come on, let's go.

255
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:21,103
<i>We're wasting time, let's get it going</i>

256
00:17:21,265 --> 00:17:23,062
<i>Get them apple trees a-growing</i>

257
00:17:23,225 --> 00:17:26,661
<i>- There's a lot of work up there to do
- There's a lot of work up there to do</i>

258
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:31,774
<i>- Oh, there's a lot of work to do
- Oh, there's a lot of work to do</i>

259
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:37,464
<i>Well, sir, now you know the reason why</i>

260
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:41,783
<i>whenever I see that certain sky,
I think of little John.</i>

261
00:17:41,945 --> 00:17:44,334
<i>Because it's like I said, if you'll recall.</i>

262
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:47,224
<i>Them clouds ain't really clouds at all.</i>

263
00:17:47,425 --> 00:17:49,780
<i>They're apple blossoms, if you please,</i>

264
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:54,461
<i>from John's heavenly orchard
of apple trees.</i>

265
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:59,062
<i>And someday they're will be apples there</i>

266
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:04,857
<i>For everyone in the world to share</i>

267
00:18:05,065 --> 00:18:15,054
<i>The Lord is good to me</i>
