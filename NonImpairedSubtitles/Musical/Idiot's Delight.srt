1
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,699
Private Van, you ride with the driver.
Okay, pal.

2
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:57,304
You can't cross 5th Ave.
till the parade is finished.

3
00:06:57,305 --> 00:07:00,065
How long will that be ?
Don't ask me, buddy.

4
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:23,200
Goodbye, babe.
We'll miss you terribly.

5
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:24,732
Yeah, don't kid the troupe.

6
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:26,340
Goodbye, honey.

7
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:29,221
Remember, you promised to write.
Sure, every day.

8
00:07:29,222 --> 00:07:31,212
Goodbye, beautiful.

9
00:07:31,513 --> 00:07:34,370
Goodbye, Harry.
What's the new address ?

10
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,966
Karen B. A. National Vaudeville Artists.
They'll know where I am.

11
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:39,612
Goodbye.
You've been swell to me.

12
00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:44,968
You've been wonderful to us, Harry.
Yeah, yeah, sure. Goodbye.

13
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:49,469
Don't forget, Harry.
One of these days we're gonna
see his name up in electric lights.

14
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,980
Biggest star on Broadway.

15
00:07:56,081 --> 00:08:00,129
You oughta realize, Harry,
that this is the wrong season
to be looking for openings in outdoors stuff.

16
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,866
Every Carnival attraction is set.

17
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:05,477
You should have come back sooner.
I know, I shouldn't have let
the war last so long.

18
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:07,575
But you ain't licked.
No, I ain't licked.

19
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:11,845
No, all your friends, and you got a million of them,
they all have the utmost respect for you, Harry.

20
00:08:11,846 --> 00:08:16,618
Sure, plenty of respect, but no job.
Don't be like that, you'll get a job.

21
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:19,060
You with your talent and fine war record.

22
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:23,152
All we gotta do is slap a little add
on the billboard and before you know it...

23
00:08:33,553 --> 00:08:37,620
So you went into a speakeasy
and told the man you wanted a cocktail, did you ?
Huh-huh.

24
00:08:37,627 --> 00:08:40,123
And I suppose you drank the cocktail ?
Hm ?

25
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:43,005
I merely asked did you drink the cocktail ?
Hm-hm.

26
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:46,433
Come now. You can't expect me
to believe you went into a speakeasy...

27
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:50,201
... told a man you wanted a cocktail
and then didn't drink it.
I couldn't.

28
00:08:50,202 --> 00:08:52,767
Why not, were you paralyzed ?
No.

29
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,632
I didn't drink it because...

30
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,360
Because why ?
Because the man hadn't any.

31
00:09:30,147 --> 00:09:34,730
By the light of the silvery moon

32
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:38,209
I want to croon

33
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,723
to my honey I'll croon love's tune.

34
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:47,228
Honeymoon, keep a-shining in June

35
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:52,698
Your silvery beams will bring love's dreams,
We'll be cuddling soon

36
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:54,935
By the silvery moon.

37
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:00,154
And there you are, friends...

38
00:10:00,155 --> 00:10:05,444
Now, the miracle remedy,
old Dr. Maltese's marvelous elixir...

39
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:09,015
... discovered in the desert of Arizona
by Wahoo, Chief of the Kickapoo Indians.

40
00:10:09,016 --> 00:10:10,806
Right, chief ?
Mm-mm.

41
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:14,216
Unfortunately, Chief Wahoo
doesn't speak a word of English
or he'd tell you all about it.

42
00:10:14,217 --> 00:10:18,946
But words don't mean a thing, friends.
You'll have to try the medicine
to find out the marvelous results.

43
00:10:18,947 --> 00:10:20,106
Here come the cops.

44
00:10:33,413 --> 00:10:36,742
Well, what do you want ?
Madam, I bring you the
golden book of knowledge.

45
00:10:36,743 --> 00:10:39,228
The New University Encyclopedia.
Tells you the facts of life.

46
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:41,962
I don't want any facts.
I got too many of them already.

47
00:10:47,763 --> 00:10:52,271
As I pass among you I shall ask you to produce some objects,
either from your pockets or wearing apparel.

48
00:10:52,272 --> 00:10:54,980
These will be identified instantly by Madame Zuleika.

49
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:56,562
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

50
00:10:56,563 --> 00:10:58,985
Please note that I have no
radio broadcasting sets concealed.

51
00:10:58,986 --> 00:11:02,107
This is entirely mental.
All I ask of you is that you concentrate.

52
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:05,099
Come anyone, any object.
Oh, thank you, madam.

53
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,198
Speak. Hurry up. What is it ?
Concentrate.

54
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:13,626
Say something. Hurry up.
What am I holding ?

55
00:11:13,627 --> 00:11:16,874
Concentrate.
It's a...

56
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:20,967
... a medicine.
What kind ? Concentrate.

57
00:11:20,968 --> 00:11:22,840
Headache powders.

58
00:11:22,841 --> 00:11:25,310
Very good, Zuleika.
Thank you, madam.

59
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,170
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I just want to say...

60
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:31,318
... that charges have been made
that all these articles which I obtained...

61
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:35,267
... and which are identified instantly
by the telepathic genius of Madame Zuleika...

62
00:11:35,268 --> 00:11:39,088
... had been handed to me by confederates of mine
previously planted in the audience.

63
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:43,400
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want once and for all to disprove these ridiculous charges...

64
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:46,598
before you,
the good citizens of this fair city of Omaha.

65
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:50,455
We have the good fortune
to have with us tonight, sitting right up here...

66
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:55,494
... the honorable Thomas McCreevy
and his very charming wife, Mrs. McCreevy.

67
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:57,576
I shall ask them to furnish me with an object.

68
00:11:57,577 --> 00:12:02,148
I'm sure that you all know
that the honorable Thomas McCreevy
and his very lovely wife...

69
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:03,616
... are no confederates of mine.

70
00:12:03,617 --> 00:12:05,865
We don't know no such thing !

71
00:12:05,866 --> 00:12:09,379
I shall treat that remark
with the contempt it so richly deserves.

72
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,532
Now, Mr. McCreevy, if you would be so kind.

73
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:19,276
Or perhaps Mrs. McCreevy will oblige.
Thank you very kindly.

74
00:12:19,277 --> 00:12:21,382
Now we can get it.

75
00:12:21,383 --> 00:12:23,594
Concentrate.

76
00:12:23,595 --> 00:12:28,015
Concentrate, concentrate.

77
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:30,041
See that water she's drinking ?

78
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:32,857
It's gin.

79
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:38,199
Now, you can't keep Mrs. McCreevy waiting.
Concentrate.

80
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,787
There's a... disturbance here.

81
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:49,514
Telepathic waves are all ... all confused.

82
00:12:50,515 --> 00:12:53,180
She's drunk.
Sure.

83
00:12:53,181 --> 00:12:58,136
We must dispel this confusion.
The waves must get through.

84
00:12:58,137 --> 00:13:01,030
Umm.. everybody concentrate.

85
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:05,773
Now, can't you concentrate ?

86
00:13:05,775 --> 00:13:09,742
Now, can't you concentrate ? Concentrate.

87
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:13,906
It's a vanity case.

88
00:13:13,907 --> 00:13:16,745
What ?
A vanity case.

89
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:19,018
It's a vanity case.

90
00:13:26,732 --> 00:13:28,516
Tell them to ring down that curtain.

91
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,206
Can I have your attention for just one moment.

92
00:13:31,207 --> 00:13:33,093
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

93
00:13:33,094 --> 00:13:36,687
Now please remember that the greatest scientists
sometimes slip up with their experiments.

94
00:13:36,688 --> 00:13:41,623
So, with your kind indulgence,
we will continue with our performance
and attempt to demonstrate...

95
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,856
Get a hold of her
Quiet !

96
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:09,246
Some dame. Where is she ? I'll break her neck !
Was it you ?
Me ?

97
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:12,127
Yes, you, you cheap little acrobat.

98
00:14:12,128 --> 00:14:14,773
You were standing in the wings
when we went on.

99
00:14:14,774 --> 00:14:16,643
Why, I was talking to this gentleman, wasn't I ?

100
00:14:16,644 --> 00:14:18,663
I wasn't even watching your stupid act.

101
00:14:18,664 --> 00:14:20,728
I'll find out who it was.

102
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:25,020
And when I do I'll beat the living crown out of her !
Shut up, Madame. !

103
00:14:25,021 --> 00:14:26,803
What I want to know is
who rung that curtain down.

104
00:14:26,804 --> 00:14:28,297
I did. What about it ?

105
00:14:28,298 --> 00:14:31,944
Nothing. I just wanted to know.
Well, now you do know.
Come on, next act. Strike the orchestra.

106
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:36,975
They're deliberately trying to ruin us.
Excuse me, Mr. Van.

107
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:42,180
Clear the stage.

108
00:14:42,186 --> 00:14:45,119
Let's get out of here.
Ready Fellara ? Take it away.

109
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:30,106
Who do you suppose hollered to Zuleika from the wings ?
I don't know. Probably the ghost of
P.T. Barnum trying to help out a pal.

110
00:15:30,107 --> 00:15:31,737
What's gonna happen to you now, Harry ?

111
00:15:31,738 --> 00:15:37,257
She'll have a fine hangover tomorrow,
then she'll take the pledge and swear
she'll never take another drink so help her.

112
00:15:37,258 --> 00:15:41,888
Then next week in Little Rock
she'll feel another cold coming on
and it'll be the same thing all over again.

113
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:46,313
Then one day you'll look at the billboard
and see "Harry Van at Liberty, Again".

114
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,473
That's show business.
Yes, yes, the gay, carefree world of entertainment.

115
00:15:50,474 --> 00:15:54,853
Come on, old lady.
Good night, Harry.
Good night, Jim. Good night, Mumpo. Be a good girl.

116
00:16:08,454 --> 00:16:10,215
Well, what can I do for you ?

117
00:16:10,216 --> 00:16:12,633
If it's an autograph, I'm sorry.
I never learned how to read or write.

118
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:15,845
No, I'm not collecting autographs, Mr. Van.

119
00:16:15,846 --> 00:16:18,703
I have something rather important to tell you.

120
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:20,164
What is it, babe ?

121
00:16:20,165 --> 00:16:22,334
Do you mind if I sit down ?

122
00:16:22,335 --> 00:16:25,409
As a matter of fact I do. But anyway, have a seat.

123
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:30,058
And if you see a bottle of champagne
sitting around, open her up.
Now, what's on your mind ?

124
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:33,881
I want to confess.
You'll find a church right around the corner.

125
00:16:33,882 --> 00:16:35,883
I was the one who prompted Madame Zuleika.

126
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:38,721
You ?
Yes, I couldn't help it, Mr. Van.
Who are you anyway ?

127
00:16:38,722 --> 00:16:41,740
I'm one of the Fellara troupe.
I know you're an acrobat, but...

128
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:44,496
Oh, you noticed me.
We've been on the same bill a week, haven't we ?

129
00:16:44,497 --> 00:16:47,716
Yes, but you never seem
to pay any attention to anyone.

130
00:16:47,717 --> 00:16:50,389
Why did you holler out like that
tonight and ruin the act ?

131
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,851
Anybody could see
that she was in an alcoholic fog.

132
00:16:52,852 --> 00:16:56,144
So thick that your signals couldn't get through.
I knew what you were trying to say.

133
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:58,996
How did you know that ?
I've been watching your act, Mr. Van.

134
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:02,782
I couldn't help picking up some of the code.
I mean, your tone of voice when you say...

135
00:17:02,783 --> 00:17:05,924
... "Concentrate".
There are subtle changes that mean different things.

136
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:09,299
Where did you learn words like "subtle" ?

137
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,841
I haven't always been an acrobat, Mr. Van.

138
00:17:11,842 --> 00:17:14,130
I attended the University in Vienna.

139
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,890
I worked with Freud, Jung, all the great teachers.

140
00:17:16,891 --> 00:17:19,716
From the University in Vienna to the Eldorado in Omaha.

141
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:21,759
Some jump.
Yes.

142
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,695
That's been my whole life.
Today the mountain tops, tomorrow the Dead Sea.

143
00:17:26,696 --> 00:17:29,140
Yeah, I guess you're right, sister.

144
00:17:29,141 --> 00:17:31,999
But you haven't yet explained
why you tried to please Madame Zuleika.

145
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,250
I had to, Mr. Van, because...

146
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:37,787
... because I have a great admiration for you.

147
00:17:41,488 --> 00:17:45,911
You liked my electrical personality, hm ?
No, nothing as obvious as that.

148
00:17:45,912 --> 00:17:48,793
I think you have a very remarkable brain.

149
00:17:48,794 --> 00:17:51,481
So you've noticed that too, eh ?

150
00:17:52,682 --> 00:17:54,805
I also have a very remarkable brain.

151
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:59,064
Yeah, but a very remarkable way of talking
for a girl who makes her living swinging by her teeth.

152
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:02,602
I was born for excitement, adventure, danger.

153
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:06,967
I've had all of them.
I'll have a lot more
before I come to a violent death.

154
00:18:06,968 --> 00:18:09,034
So you've even got that arranged.

155
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:11,041
Well...

156
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:13,195
So what are your plans for supper ?

157
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:19,127
Oh, Mr. Van.
Are you inviting me ?

158
00:18:19,128 --> 00:18:21,512
Don't look at me like that.
I'm only offering to buy you a cup of coffee...

159
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:24,566
... because I appreciate your kind motives
in busting up our act tonight.

160
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:26,662
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Van.

161
00:18:26,663 --> 00:18:28,513
I'll get dressed right away.

162
00:18:29,514 --> 00:18:31,946
I'll be proud to be seen in a restaurant with you.

163
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:37,385
This place, "Eats".
What beautiful simplicity in those words.

164
00:18:37,386 --> 00:18:39,402
They tell a whole story.

165
00:18:39,403 --> 00:18:40,599
Yeah.

166
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,038
How you are, Mr Van ?
You are, lady ?

167
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,064
Special tonight, corned bee hash.
Corned beef hash is always special.
Give me a cup of coffee and some donuts.

168
00:18:50,065 --> 00:18:52,087
What'll you have, babe ?
Oyster stew.

169
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:56,593
Are the oysters strictly fresh ?
Sure, we fly them in every day
from Baltimore in aeroplane.

170
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,275
Oyster stew.
Oyster stew.

171
00:19:04,196 --> 00:19:08,596
And I'll have corned beef hash with two poached eggs,
whole wheat toast butter then grade A milk.

172
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:11,851
Aren't you gonna have some dessert ?
Oh, yes. I'll order that later.

173
00:19:11,852 --> 00:19:16,998
I guess you have to eat a lot to keep
your teeth in training for that iron jaw act, eh ?
Yes.

174
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:22,541
In old Russia we used to serve an entire roast ox before lunch.
Just as an hors d'oeuvre.

175
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:24,364
You certainly lived on a big scale, babe.

176
00:19:24,365 --> 00:19:26,435
My name isn't Babe.

177
00:19:26,436 --> 00:19:29,004
It's Irene.
Don't worry about that. I call everybody babe.

178
00:19:29,005 --> 00:19:31,284
Perhaps that's why I don't like it.

179
00:19:31,285 --> 00:19:33,865
I'm not everybody.
Oh, I beg your pardon.

180
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:35,698
I should have realized, you're pretty exclusive.

181
00:19:35,699 --> 00:19:37,220
I am.

182
00:19:37,221 --> 00:19:39,405
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, Mr. Van.

183
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:41,280
That's all right. I'm not seriously injured.

184
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:44,704
You see, I was really born to live in a palace.

185
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:48,572
So it isn't always easy to adjust myself to as dark a place as Eats.

186
00:19:48,573 --> 00:19:51,350
Well, here's your food.
Perhaps that'll help the adjustment.

187
00:19:51,351 --> 00:19:54,465
85 cents.
She hasn't finished ordering yet.

188
00:19:57,866 --> 00:19:59,759
Careful how you handle those knees.

189
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,040
Ouch !
Yeah, you gotta do it like this.

190
00:20:04,341 --> 00:20:07,511
That's a technique you learn
after you get the Ritz out of your mind.

191
00:20:07,612 --> 00:20:09,027
Oh, I haven't got a table napkin.

192
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:11,817
I'll get one.

193
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:19,855
Ain't one napkin enough ?
Not for a repast like this.

194
00:20:19,856 --> 00:20:21,526
Thank you very much, Mr. Van.

195
00:20:21,527 --> 00:20:24,474
Listen, Irene, you can discard the Mr. Van.
My name's Harry.

196
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:26,576
But I don't like Harry.
What's the matter with it ?

197
00:20:26,577 --> 00:20:29,603
It sounds cheap.
Isn't your name Henry ?

198
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:32,262
No. And it isn't Harold either.

199
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:36,106
Very well, Harry.
Whatever I call you, I think you're sweet.

200
00:20:36,107 --> 00:20:38,371
Eat your stew.

201
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:42,326
Where did you get your education, Harry ?

202
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:45,379
What makes you think I got one ?
Oh, I know you have. You're like me.

203
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,651
You're a student of life.
Well, I worked my way
through college selling encyclopedias.

204
00:20:49,652 --> 00:20:52,480
I knew you had culture.
What college was it ?

205
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:54,095
No college in particular.

206
00:20:54,096 --> 00:20:56,489
You know, my line of selling talk was so good
I fell for it myself.

207
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,953
I bought the whole bunch of encyclopedias
and read them cover to cover.

208
00:21:05,454 --> 00:21:07,911
Here. Try the hash.

209
00:21:10,012 --> 00:21:12,046
Oh, there isn't any ketchup.

210
00:21:12,047 --> 00:21:14,641
No, so there isn't.

211
00:21:18,942 --> 00:21:20,616
Excuse me, babe.

212
00:21:20,617 --> 00:21:24,258
You're so very kind.
Yeah, I think you're right.

213
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:26,948
You know, it makes my blood boil.

214
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:30,305
I mean, it makes me so furious to think that you're only a...

215
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:32,732
What is the word for it ?
Word for what ?

216
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:36,436
Stooge. That's it.
A stooge for that drunken old hag.

217
00:21:36,437 --> 00:21:39,367
Hey, choose your words more carefully, babe.

218
00:21:39,368 --> 00:21:43,608
I tell you my name is Irene.
Whatever it is, no cracks out of you about Madame Zuleika.

219
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:45,609
She's a very wonderful, wonderful woman.

220
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,172
A genius.

221
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:49,342
And besides that, I'm not a stooge.

222
00:21:49,343 --> 00:21:51,571
I'm the one who does the real brain work in the act.

223
00:21:51,572 --> 00:21:54,615
You know, Harry, I could learn that code easily.

224
00:21:54,616 --> 00:21:56,070
You think so ?
I know I could.

225
00:21:56,071 --> 00:21:59,087
I don't know. It's a very deep, complicated scientific problem.

226
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:01,316
We'd be perfect together, you and me.

227
00:22:01,573 --> 00:22:05,442
I can see the electric sign
shining over Picadilly Circus in London.

228
00:22:05,443 --> 00:22:10,523
It reads Irene, Irene the Great.

229
00:22:10,524 --> 00:22:14,618
Assisted by Harry Van.
You got a nice billing there.

230
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:18,874
You'd love London.
I was there as a little girl
after I escaped from the Soviets.

231
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:22,926
That was a terrible exerience.
I must tell you about it, Mr. Van.

232
00:22:22,927 --> 00:22:27,610
All right, but you've got four shows tomorrow,
and seeing as you're still an acrobat
you'd better get some sleep.

233
00:22:32,211 --> 00:22:34,021
Do you know that song ?

234
00:22:34,022 --> 00:22:36,522
It's Kaak Strana. It's Russian.

235
00:22:36,744 --> 00:22:38,478
It's so lovely.

236
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:42,729
It takes me back so far
to the Winter Palace in Petersburg.

237
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,132
That means "How Strange."

238
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:58,982
It tells such a sad, beautiful story
about two people who meet...

239
00:22:58,983 --> 00:23:02,078
... and fall in love for one exquisite moment.

240
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:04,198
And then they part.

241
00:23:04,475 --> 00:23:07,214
Like ships that pass in the night.

242
00:23:18,515 --> 00:23:20,814
How strange.

243
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:28,174
When will you teach me the code, Harry ?

244
00:23:28,175 --> 00:23:30,563
We'll get together soon
and run over the fundamentals.

245
00:23:30,582 --> 00:23:33,888
Hiya, Frank.
Good evening, Mr. Van.
Good evening, Miss Irene.

246
00:23:33,889 --> 00:23:37,034
Hello, Harry.
Hi, Ed. Hi, Bert.

247
00:23:37,035 --> 00:23:40,336
Well, good night, babe.

248
00:23:43,837 --> 00:23:45,178
Do we have to say good night ?

249
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:48,532
Yes, we do. I'm going to join the boys
for a little political discussion.

250
00:23:49,933 --> 00:23:53,434
All right, Harry. Good night.
Good night.

251
00:23:54,035 --> 00:23:57,469
Thanks for giving me such a good time.
Oh, thank you, Irene.

252
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,677
I always enjoy seeing a woman eat.

253
00:23:59,678 --> 00:24:05,708
Don't forget now.
Brush your teeth carefully, tuck yourself in
and have sweet dreams of old Russia.

254
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:11,522
Hod did the show go tonight ?
Just as usual. A sensation.

255
00:24:11,523 --> 00:24:14,722
It's always warm, Harry.
Yes, we got a very warm reception tonight.

256
00:24:14,723 --> 00:24:16,885
In fact, I'm still burning.

257
00:24:16,886 --> 00:24:20,282
Go for a little drink ?
Bert here's got some pre-war rye.

258
00:24:20,283 --> 00:24:23,964
Yeah, pre to the next war.
But it's all right, though.
I know the guy who made it.

259
00:24:23,965 --> 00:24:26,885
No, thanks, Bert. I'm going to bed.
I gotta think about my art.

260
00:24:26,886 --> 00:24:30,083
Yeah, we know all about your art...

261
00:24:30,084 --> 00:24:31,990
Good night.
Good night.

262
00:24:41,588 --> 00:24:44,425
Thank you very much, sir.
It will be returned imediately.

263
00:24:44,426 --> 00:24:46,949
Now, what is it ?
What am I holding, Madame ?

264
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,657
A key.
What kind of a key ?

265
00:24:48,658 --> 00:24:51,135
A key to a room.
A man's room.

266
00:24:51,136 --> 00:24:53,623
Very good, Madame.
What else can you tell me about it ?

267
00:24:53,624 --> 00:24:57,249
Come, come, Madame. Concentrate.
There are numbers on it.

268
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,769
Magic, mystic numbres.
Yes, yes.

269
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:05,017
I read in the book of fate 274.
Very good, Madame. Very good.

270
00:25:05,018 --> 00:25:06,775
Thank you very much, sir.

271
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,486
Who gave you permission
to wrap my best sock around your head ?

272
00:25:14,487 --> 00:25:17,400
When it comes to that,
how did you get in here at all ?

273
00:25:17,401 --> 00:25:20,511
All the keys in this hotel fit all those doors.

274
00:25:20,512 --> 00:25:23,081
So you've been experimenting, huh ?

275
00:25:23,082 --> 00:25:25,840
Well, what do you want now ?

276
00:25:25,842 --> 00:25:28,492
Please teach me the code, Harry.
No.

277
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:31,415
I tell you I could learn it. I know I could.
I know part of it already.

278
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:34,681
When you were talking about
Mr. McCreevy's wife in the audience...

279
00:25:34,682 --> 00:25:37,481
... and you said... Now...

280
00:25:37,482 --> 00:25:39,213
... that means the number is 1.

281
00:25:39,214 --> 00:25:45,511
"Can't" means 2.
When you said "Now, can't you concentrate ?",
that is 1-2, which is 12 and 12 is a vanity case.

282
00:25:45,512 --> 00:25:48,261
And "Concentrate" means...
Where did you find out all these things ?

283
00:25:49,662 --> 00:25:54,809
Well, I... just figured it out by psychology.

284
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:57,148
You're lying through those pretty teeth.
You've been snooping.

285
00:25:57,149 --> 00:25:59,533
Well...
Where did you get that coat ?

286
00:26:00,534 --> 00:26:04,088
I suppose I might as well tell you.
You'd better.

287
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:06,432
So you stole it, huh ?

288
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:10,103
Don't you realize the American Society of Magicians
could put thieves like you in jail ?

289
00:26:10,104 --> 00:26:13,462
Why Harry, I only went into the dressing room to see Mr. Barzek...

290
00:26:13,463 --> 00:26:18,168
... and I made friends with little Mumpo
and the coat was lying there so I just...

291
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,323
... well... I just borrowed it.

292
00:26:21,324 --> 00:26:25,278
Please forgive me, Harry.

293
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,378
Can't you understand
that I just want to improve myself ?

294
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,349
I want to be someone.

295
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:35,167
And if I could only work with you,
be your partner then I...
Sure. You'd have your name up in lights in London.

296
00:26:35,168 --> 00:26:37,639
"Assisted by Harry Van."

297
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,751
You're a funny kid at that.

298
00:26:41,752 --> 00:26:45,399
I gotta admit it. And maybe you're right.

299
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,166
Maybe you do deserve something better
than just being an acrobat.

300
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,999
But unfortunately I haven't the time to teach you the whole code.

301
00:26:52,292 --> 00:26:55,467
However, I'll tell you what I'll do.
What, Harry ?

302
00:26:55,468 --> 00:26:57,752
I'll read you something out of the encyclopedia.

303
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:04,102
This is the article about the subject of truth.

304
00:27:06,403 --> 00:27:12,706
"Truth is the ideal of perfection for which all artists,
scientists and philosophers have striven.

305
00:27:12,707 --> 00:27:19,918
The poet Keats wrote: Beauty is truth. Truth beauty.
That's all you know on earth
and all you need to know.

306
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,489
However, various philosophers,
notably the early Greeks, have argued that..."

307
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,855
Watch yourself, please.

308
00:27:55,556 --> 00:27:58,575
How much is this piece of junk ?
75 cents.

309
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,920
75c... six bits ?

310
00:28:00,921 --> 00:28:02,110
That's right.

311
00:28:02,111 --> 00:28:04,283
That thing isn't worth more than a nickle.
Are you crazy ?

312
00:28:04,284 --> 00:28:07,053
I'm sorry, brother. I didn't write the prices.
I'm only here to repeat them.

313
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:11,374
OK, pal. I'll take the phony thing.

314
00:28:13,075 --> 00:28:15,467
Which proves I'm crazy too.

315
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:17,914
You're right again.
Don't mention it.

316
00:28:20,015 --> 00:28:25,580
Well, babe, it seems we have to say goodbye.
You're going north to Sioux Falls
and I'm heading south on the Interstate.

317
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:27,665
Train's pulling out in a few minutes.

318
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,595
Do you think we'll ever see each other again, Harry ?

319
00:28:29,596 --> 00:28:31,927
Maybe we will and maybe we won't.

320
00:28:31,928 --> 00:28:33,942
You can't predict anything in show business.

321
00:28:33,943 --> 00:28:36,331
Or in any other kind of a life, I suppose.

322
00:28:36,332 --> 00:28:37,849
No, I guess not.

323
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,659
But I'll be thinking about you, babe.

324
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,681
Oh, I'm sure you will.

325
00:28:41,682 --> 00:28:45,712
As a matter of fact
I'd like to know that you're thinking
about me a little bit too.

326
00:28:45,713 --> 00:28:52,322
I guess it's a mistake in show business
to remember anything except the part
you're about to play.

327
00:28:52,855 --> 00:28:57,954
Yep. Well, even so...
I got you something.

328
00:29:00,219 --> 00:29:03,760
What is it ?
I don't know what it is.
You hang neckties on it, I guess.

329
00:29:03,761 --> 00:29:06,339
It's just a souvenir, see ? Says so here: Souvenir Omaha.

330
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,660
Did you buy it for me, Harry ?
Yes. Certainly I did.

331
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:14,241
What's more, it cost 75c.
That's the most expensive present I ever bought for any dame.

332
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,492
What made you want to buy a present for me, Harry ?

333
00:29:17,493 --> 00:29:20,794
I don't know. It's against my principles.

334
00:29:20,795 --> 00:29:24,127
But you know, Irene ?
I've met a lot of dames in my time...

335
00:29:24,128 --> 00:29:27,043
... and most of them are so dumb
you have to talk to them in sign language.

336
00:29:27,044 --> 00:29:29,331
You're the only one I've met I couldn't answer.

337
00:29:29,332 --> 00:29:34,051
That's because I'm the only one that recognizes you
for the great man that you are.

338
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:36,830
Great man, huh ?
Great bust.

339
00:29:36,831 --> 00:29:39,087
Tried everything, failed at everything.

340
00:29:39,381 --> 00:29:44,044
But you don't see it that way, babe,
because the world you live in
isn't a world of facts and figures...

341
00:29:44,045 --> 00:29:45,604
It's a world of dreams.

342
00:29:45,605 --> 00:29:48,247
That's what I like about you, Irene.

343
00:29:48,248 --> 00:29:50,606
You're so beautifully phony.

344
00:29:50,607 --> 00:29:53,163
And maybe you're wrong, my darling.

345
00:29:53,164 --> 00:29:56,783
Maybe we two cheap people with our cheap lives...

346
00:29:56,784 --> 00:30:01,021
... maybe we're the only ones
in this crazy world who are real.

347
00:30:07,453 --> 00:30:12,921
12:34 train for Sioux City,
Sioux Falls

348
00:30:13,224 --> 00:30:15,804
We gotta be pulling out now, babe.

349
00:30:15,805 --> 00:30:19,174
We gotta be pulling out, I know,
but not together.

350
00:30:19,176 --> 00:30:21,795
No, not together, you go your way and I go mine.

351
00:30:21,796 --> 00:30:24,669
But I got a hunch we'll see each other again, some time.

352
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,254
Yes, Harry.

353
00:30:29,155 --> 00:30:31,429
Goodbye, Harry.
Goodbye, Irene.

354
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,005
Thanks for the souvenir.

355
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:41,094
Hello, Harry, dear.

356
00:30:41,095 --> 00:30:42,875
Hello, Madame.

357
00:31:04,591 --> 00:31:06,006
Goodbye.

358
00:31:06,007 --> 00:31:07,877
Goodbye, Irene.

359
00:32:34,576 --> 00:32:37,470
What are they talking about, Harry ?
How should I know ?

360
00:32:37,473 --> 00:32:39,583
But you're always saying you know the language.

361
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:43,086
The last time I said that was when we were in Romania
and that was six countries ago.

362
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:45,025
When are we gonna get to a decent place to sleep ?

363
00:32:45,026 --> 00:32:46,682
When we get to Geneva.

364
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,353
Excuse me, countess.

365
00:33:12,254 --> 00:33:14,341
What's the trouble now ?

366
00:33:14,342 --> 00:33:16,185
Another frontier, I guess.

367
00:33:16,186 --> 00:33:20,401
That's my analysis of what's the trouble with Europe,
there are too many frontiers that keep waking you up.

368
00:33:20,402 --> 00:33:22,558
Skip it.

369
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:32,897
What did he say, Harry ?
I'll ask him.
So what's the word, pal ?

370
00:33:36,698 --> 00:33:39,621
I guess we're supposed to get out here.
Come on, we gotta get the baggage, girls.

371
00:33:39,622 --> 00:33:42,284
Is this Geneva ?
Does it look like Geneva ?

372
00:33:42,285 --> 00:33:44,046
I don't know.

373
00:34:02,147 --> 00:34:07,147
Oh, Harry, I'm so cold.
I'm freezing...

374
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:14,818
I'm so glad to know you, Mr. and Mrs. Cherry.
It was awfully kind of you
to come down and meet us.

375
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:20,372
It was a pleasure, I assure you.
And I think I can assure you that your stay
at the Montaloda Hotel will be a thouroughly enjoyable one.

376
00:34:20,373 --> 00:34:23,418
Civilized people at last.
Come on girls, follow me.

377
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:27,366
The hotel porters are attending to your luggage.
If you'll just step into the bus...

378
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:30,715
Hey, listen pal, you're an American, aren't you ?
I am, Don Navadel's the name.

379
00:34:30,716 --> 00:34:33,953
Harry Van's mine.
Mr. Van, I sure am glad to know you.
Glad to see you.

380
00:34:33,954 --> 00:34:36,225
Anything I can do for you ?
Yeah, we'd like to know what's the idea.

381
00:34:36,226 --> 00:34:39,541
The idea ? Of what ?
Kicking us off the train, pushing us around.

382
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:43,321
Are you all here, girls ?
Wait a minute, one two, three, four, five...

383
00:34:43,322 --> 00:34:46,483
Six. Yes. we're all here.

384
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:49,022
We're entertainers at nightclubs,
we're trying to get to Geneva, Switzerland.

385
00:34:49,023 --> 00:34:51,983
Well, there's rather serious trouble just now here at this frontier.

386
00:34:51,984 --> 00:34:55,192
Say, perhaps you and the young ladies
would like to come up to our hotel for a little while...

387
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:58,716
... till this situation has been cleared up.
Yeah, Harry, let's go to the hotel.

388
00:34:58,717 --> 00:35:00,257
We'd like to sleep in a bed for a change.

389
00:35:00,258 --> 00:35:02,540
No, we're not stopping at any hotel. We got to get to Geneva.

390
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:05,246
Look, Harry.
Look what they're doing to our trunks.

391
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,989
Excuse me.
Wait here, girls.

392
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,802
Hey, hey !

393
00:35:10,803 --> 00:35:13,913
Would you please be a little more
careful with those trunks ?
They contain the wardrobe of my act.

394
00:35:22,935 --> 00:35:24,693
Yeah, I'll take vanilla.

395
00:35:40,943 --> 00:35:43,576
Hey, listen buddy,
will you please tell me
what I'm supposed to do with these trunks ?

396
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:47,977
Excuse me, my friend.
Another white man in this jungle ?
How do you do ?

397
00:35:47,978 --> 00:35:49,932
My name's Harry Van.
My name is Quillary.

398
00:35:49,933 --> 00:35:54,025
I've got 6 girls with me, I'm in terrible trouble.
The whole world is in terrible trouble, Mr. Van.

399
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,003
Well, what are we all gonna do about it ?
Who can tell ?

400
00:35:56,004 --> 00:35:58,772
I just talked to one of the officials here
who can speak a little French...

401
00:35:58,773 --> 00:36:02,065
... and he said that there are orders
that no one is permitted to cross the frontier.

402
00:36:02,066 --> 00:36:05,537
Look, I must get back to my country.
I must get back to Italy.

403
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:09,829
I'm a German. They have no right to deny me.
I shall make a protest to our Embassy.

404
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:14,000
There's an American here.
I think he's connected to the local hotel.
Let's go see him. Maybe he can tell us something.

405
00:36:14,012 --> 00:36:18,218
Harry, Mr. Navadel is telling us all about the hotel.

406
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:21,637
They have winter sports here.
They're in the skiing business.
"Shiing".

407
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:24,610
Never mind the winter sports.
But can't we go up there, Harry ?

408
00:36:24,611 --> 00:36:27,091
We're sick of those smelly day coaches.
Shut up !

409
00:36:27,092 --> 00:36:29,660
These three gentlemen and I
want to know where we can find
the head man around here.

410
00:36:29,661 --> 00:36:32,192
There must be somebody who can tell us when we do get across that border.

411
00:36:32,193 --> 00:36:35,115
The Commander of the Frontier Post is
Captain Kirvline and he's stopping at the hotel.

412
00:36:35,116 --> 00:36:37,721
Let's go up to see him, Harry.
Yes, let's go up and get a drink.

413
00:36:37,722 --> 00:36:39,719
All right.
What about the baggage ?

414
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,235
Our porter will attend to that.

415
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,738
Here we are, folks.

416
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:02,869
Quick, quick, take the luggage.

417
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,478
Say, this place is a berry.

418
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:15,827
We can have a swell time here.

419
00:37:15,828 --> 00:37:19,892
After the way we've been betrayed in the Balkans
we can't afford to have a swell time any place.

420
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:24,020
This is our cocktail lounge.

421
00:37:25,221 --> 00:37:27,566
Rather a magnificent view, isn't it ?

422
00:37:27,567 --> 00:37:29,407
It's great.

423
00:37:36,808 --> 00:37:38,925
What's that big bare patch down there ?

424
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:41,305
It's an airport.
We have a great deal of flying around here.

425
00:37:41,306 --> 00:37:43,725
That's swell. I love aviators.
You do ?

426
00:37:43,726 --> 00:37:45,624
This place looks to me like it's laying an egg.

427
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:49,301
Laying a what ?
I mean, you aren't doing much business,
I don't see many customers around.

428
00:37:49,302 --> 00:37:52,241
This is between seasons.
Do you own this hotel ?

429
00:37:52,242 --> 00:37:53,807
I'm the social manager.

430
00:37:53,808 --> 00:37:56,149
A professional breeder, huh ?
How did you happen to get here ?

431
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,907
I'm a specialist in resort hotel business
all the way from Santa Barbara to St. Moritz.

432
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:02,199
Perhaps the gentlemen and ladies
would care to register now ?

433
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,218
No. I'm not registering until I find out what's going on.
Come on, Harry, let's settle down.

434
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:09,543
We can go to Geneva some other time.
Relax, girls. I'll attend to the bookings.

435
00:38:09,544 --> 00:38:12,515
Then you do not want rooms ?
No, pal, I  just came up for the view.

436
00:38:12,516 --> 00:38:15,668
Evidently, Mr. Van, you're not fully aware of the current international situation.

437
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:18,404
I'm aware that the international situaton is always regrettable.

438
00:38:18,408 --> 00:38:20,668
What's wrong now ?
Haven't you been reading the papers ?

439
00:38:20,669 --> 00:38:24,884
In Bulgaria and Yugoslavia ? No.
We're on the verge of a war.

440
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,523
What ? Another one ?
When's that scheduled to begin ?

441
00:38:27,524 --> 00:38:29,585
Any minute now.
That's why they've closed every frontier in Europe.

442
00:38:29,586 --> 00:38:33,723
Mr. Van, I advise you to be careful how you talk.
Why ?

443
00:38:33,724 --> 00:38:36,707
I'm an American citizen, I can say what I please.
There's Captain Kirvline now.

444
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:40,127
I tell you I must go across that frontier.
I cannot delay.

445
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,055
I only obey my orders, Dr. Waldersee.
I can't permit anyone to cross.

446
00:38:43,056 --> 00:38:45,997
I must go into neutral territory to continue my experiments.

447
00:38:45,998 --> 00:38:49,126
I'm a scientist.
A servant of the whole stupid human race.

448
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:52,247
I'm working on a cure for cancer, a disease of civilization.

449
00:38:52,248 --> 00:38:54,491
If I delay, my experiments are ruined.

450
00:38:54,492 --> 00:38:56,561
I am deeply sorry, but I have no choice.

451
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:03,278
Captain Kirvline, this is a fellow countryman of mine, Mr. Harry Van.

452
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:06,734
Will you please tell him that the train
for Switzerland will not leave tonight.

453
00:39:06,735 --> 00:39:08,148
Yes, Mr. Van, that's the unhappy fact.

454
00:39:08,149 --> 00:39:10,398
Listen, Captain, I've got my passports,
all seven of them. Look.

455
00:39:10,399 --> 00:39:14,203
You're travelling with a large family.

456
00:39:14,204 --> 00:39:17,731
It isn't exactly a family.
There they are in there. They're blondes.

457
00:39:17,732 --> 00:39:21,200
Lovely girls they are too, Captain, and very intelligent.

458
00:39:21,201 --> 00:39:23,156
In fact, the mothers of tomorrow.

459
00:39:23,157 --> 00:39:29,179
Well, the first good thing that's happened around here in years.
Hey, girls, come here. I want you to meet the head man.

460
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:32,505
Captain Kirvline, this is Miss Shirley Laughlin,
owner of the best voice in the two continents.

461
00:39:32,506 --> 00:39:34,120
Charming.
Hiya, Captain.

462
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:37,409
And Miss Beulah Tremayne.
How do you do ?

463
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:40,437
Beulah's our bubble dancer. And quite a dreamer.
Exquisite.

464
00:39:40,438 --> 00:39:44,477
And next, Miss Francine Merle.
A daughter of the old South.

465
00:39:44,478 --> 00:39:46,423
Very alluring, eh Captain ?
Magnificent.

466
00:39:46,424 --> 00:39:49,330
Thank you ever so much, I...
Turn it off, honey.

467
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:53,352
Next, Miss Edna Creech. She's as good as gold and twice as tough.
Hiya, toots.

468
00:39:53,353 --> 00:39:57,108
Next, Miss Elaine Messiger.
I've heard she's a debutante, but she won't talk.

469
00:39:57,109 --> 00:40:00,609
And next, Miss Bebe Gould,
a very, very lovely little number.

470
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:04,591
Aw, Harry...
Yeah, Bebe's our hula artist.
Come on, shake it for the Captain.

471
00:40:04,592 --> 00:40:07,332
Hold it, hold it. Not at these prices.

472
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:11,971
That's very beautiful.
I congratulate you.

473
00:40:11,972 --> 00:40:15,820
No, it's purely business with me, Captain.
You see, we're an act. Harry Van and Les Blondes, it's called.

474
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:18,629
Oh, he's cute.
Hm, I'll say.

475
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:22,036
Now, we've got some very attractive bookings
at a night spot in Geneva.

476
00:40:22,037 --> 00:40:24,950
But we've got to be there by Thursday or else we lose the time.

477
00:40:24,951 --> 00:40:29,734
Mr. Van, under these circumstances,
it's a pleasure for me to tell you
that I cannot let you pass.

478
00:40:29,735 --> 00:40:33,706
But perhaps in the meantime
you will permit me to buy the young ladies a drink.

479
00:40:35,107 --> 00:40:37,625
Well, all right, but only one apiece.

480
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:40,723
Oh, thank you, Captain. We'd love it.
Do you have any more soldiers around here, Captain ?

481
00:40:40,724 --> 00:40:42,812
Thousands of them.

482
00:40:43,713 --> 00:40:47,676
Well, I guess I might as well register.
I'll need three double rooms, two girls to a room.

483
00:40:47,677 --> 00:40:49,146
And a single for me.

484
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:52,661
Adjoining.
I promised their mothers I'd always be within earshot.

485
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:57,015
What's that ?

486
00:40:58,716 --> 00:40:59,831
What is it ?

487
00:41:06,032 --> 00:41:09,984
Hey, hey, what's all these sirens ? Is there a fire ?
That's the warning from the airfield down there.

488
00:41:09,985 --> 00:41:13,072
They're testing combat planes in case of war.

489
00:41:26,173 --> 00:41:29,741
They look pretty tough, don't they ?
Yes, they are the wings of death.

490
00:41:29,742 --> 00:41:32,547
Maniacs. Obscene maniacs.

491
00:41:37,548 --> 00:41:41,855
All right, all right. Finish your drinks and come on upstairs.
I'm gonna give you all a bath.

492
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,969
I gotta get us in Geneva,

493
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:47,434
So don't run up any bills in this dump.
There's a hairdresser here, Harry,
can't I get a finger wave ?
No !

494
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:50,147
Can we go skiing ?
And risk breaking those pretty legs ?

495
00:41:50,148 --> 00:41:53,790
But it's healthy.
But you're not sick, those gambs of yours are my bread and butter.
Now remember...

496
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:56,693
... we get breakfast free here with our roommates,
so we eat plenty of that...

497
00:41:56,694 --> 00:41:58,056
... to lay off on the other meals.

498
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,818
I'm going down to see if there are any more news.

499
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,209
And get off my bed.

500
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:04,536
Harry, see if there's a movie in town.
Harry, don't play informant with the Captain.

501
00:42:16,037 --> 00:42:18,967
Look, Mr. Van, they're bringing out the big planes.

502
00:42:18,968 --> 00:42:20,970
They're full of bombs to drop on people.

503
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:23,623
They can fly from here to Rome, Berlin or Paris.

504
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,435
Even all the way to London.

505
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:28,922
I like the looks of the mountains better.

506
00:42:28,923 --> 00:42:30,752
You belong here in this country ?

507
00:42:30,753 --> 00:42:33,431
Yes, sir. That is to say, I didn't use to.

508
00:42:33,432 --> 00:42:36,985
That's my country over there.

509
00:42:36,986 --> 00:42:42,396
You see, after the last war they decided
those mountains must be taken away from my country.

510
00:42:42,397 --> 00:42:43,775
And I went with them.

511
00:42:43,776 --> 00:42:46,477
Then one day I became a foreigner.

512
00:42:47,778 --> 00:42:50,683
Even my old father, he's dead.

513
00:42:50,684 --> 00:42:55,106
But all the writing on the gravestones,
they rubbed it out and translated it.

514
00:42:55,107 --> 00:42:58,010
So now he's a foreigner too.

515
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:06,112
Excuse me, Mr. Van, that fine car
coming up the road must be rich people.

516
00:43:06,113 --> 00:43:08,667
I'll be needed at the door.
Excuse me, please.

517
00:43:32,268 --> 00:43:35,606
We have your reservation.
Thank you. Pardon me.

518
00:43:35,607 --> 00:43:40,732
You're gonna be with us for a long stay, madame ?
Oh, no. I'm afraid Mr. Weber must go on at once.

519
00:43:40,733 --> 00:43:45,327
But I should love to stay here in these mountains.

520
00:43:45,328 --> 00:43:50,107
They're so quiet, so cold and impersonal.

521
00:43:50,108 --> 00:43:53,719
We have a marvelous view from here.
This is our cocktail longe.

522
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:59,228
Very nice.
Achille, you must come and see this charming crew.

523
00:43:59,229 --> 00:44:00,874
In a moment, my dear.

524
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,000
And from our terrace,
on a clear day you can see for 50 miles.

525
00:44:10,001 --> 00:44:13,028
It really is a view of unparalelled beauty.

526
00:44:13,029 --> 00:44:15,915
Oh, magnificent !

527
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:19,941
Covered with the beautiful white snow.

528
00:44:19,942 --> 00:44:23,139
I think the whole world
should always be covered with snow.

529
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,912
It would be so much more clean, wouldn't it ?

530
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:30,571
Like in my Russia.
White Russia.

531
00:44:30,572 --> 00:44:32,811
You should see the snow from the terrace, madame.

532
00:44:36,312 --> 00:44:42,839
Oh, and how exciting. A flying field.
Look. All those big bombers.

533
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,549
There are so many of them.
Isn't it miraculous ?

534
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:49,367
Madame is interested in aviation ?
No, no.

535
00:44:49,368 --> 00:44:56,432
Just ordinary flying, sportsy.
But there is no experience in life quite so thrilling...

536
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:58,690
... as a parachute jump, is there ?

537
00:44:58,691 --> 00:45:01,284
I've never had that thrill, I'm ashamed to say.

538
00:45:01,285 --> 00:45:06,173
Once I had to jump when I was flying over the jungle.

539
00:45:06,174 --> 00:45:08,345
It was indescribable.

540
00:45:08,346 --> 00:45:14,513
Frisking down, sinking into that great
green sea of enchantment and hidden danger.

541
00:45:14,514 --> 00:45:16,079
And you weren't afraid ?

542
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:22,400
No, no. In moment like that,
one is given the sense of eternity.

543
00:45:22,401 --> 00:45:24,304
Yes, sir.
Hm ?

544
00:45:26,205 --> 00:45:29,411
Oh, get me a scotch.
And put ice in it.

545
00:45:29,412 --> 00:45:35,548
If you haven't got any ice,
go out and scoop up some of that beautiful, white snow.

546
00:45:36,549 --> 00:45:37,944
Yes, sir.

547
00:45:37,945 --> 00:45:42,248
But your place is really charming.
I must tell everyone in Paris about it.

548
00:45:42,249 --> 00:45:46,384
We are rather proud of it.
There is something about this design.
It suggests...

549
00:45:46,385 --> 00:45:49,446
... an amusing kind of horror.

550
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:52,581
It is like somebody's tomb, isn't it ?

551
00:45:54,182 --> 00:45:57,052
What's that ?
It's merely some kind of warning. They're testing it.

552
00:45:57,053 --> 00:46:00,137
Warning ? Warning against what ?
I believe it's for use in case of war.

553
00:46:00,138 --> 00:46:03,439
War ?
But there will be no war.

554
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,189
Achille.
Yes, Irena.

555
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,021
There will be no war, will there ?
No, there'll be no war.

556
00:46:10,022 --> 00:46:13,443
They're all too much well prepared.
Ah, there, you see ?

557
00:46:13,444 --> 00:46:18,456
They will not fight.
Mr. Weber say so, and he know.

558
00:46:18,457 --> 00:46:20,993
Wish to see your suite now, Mr. Weber ?
Yes, if you please.

559
00:46:29,354 --> 00:46:33,138
Achille, I am mad about this place.

560
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:37,790
We must be sure to tell everyone about this place.
We must make it fashionable at once.

561
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:41,641
Say, who is that ?
That's Achille Weber,
one of the biggest men in Europe.

562
00:46:41,642 --> 00:46:43,794
I used to see him often at St. Moritz.

563
00:46:43,795 --> 00:46:46,792
No, who's the dame ?
I assume she's his wife.

564
00:46:46,793 --> 00:46:48,862
You only assume it, eh ?

565
00:46:48,863 --> 00:46:52,163
Are you implying that she's not ?
No, I'm not implying anything.

566
00:46:52,164 --> 00:46:55,985
I'm just being kind of bewildered.
Evidently.

567
00:46:57,486 --> 00:46:59,878
White Russia.

568
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:05,245
Parachute jumper.

569
00:47:38,646 --> 00:47:42,234
Put it down there.
Very good, sir.
Thanks, pal.

570
00:47:44,435 --> 00:47:48,210
Bitte, mineral wasser.
Ya wohl, herr doktor.

571
00:48:07,598 --> 00:48:11,629
Old museum piece. Period of Louis XV.
You gotta hoard your gum over here.

572
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:30,599
What is that you're playing ?

573
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,215
It's an old Russian song entitled Kaak Strana

574
00:48:34,216 --> 00:48:36,422
Meaning "How Strange".

575
00:48:36,423 --> 00:48:41,184
One of those morose ballads about
how once we met for one immortal moment.

576
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:43,700
Like ships that pass in the night.

577
00:48:43,701 --> 00:48:46,385
Or maybe like a couple of drunks sideswiping each other.

578
00:48:46,486 --> 00:48:50,891
And now, I got a hunch we meet again.

579
00:48:50,892 --> 00:48:53,634
How strange.

580
00:48:53,635 --> 00:48:57,688
I'm afraid I was rude to you before.
Aw, that's all right, pal.

581
00:48:57,689 --> 00:49:00,053
I've been rude to lots of people and never regretted it.

582
00:49:00,054 --> 00:49:03,046
Sorry you should worry about a punk like me.

583
00:49:03,047 --> 00:49:05,931
You've got important work to do for the benefit of humanity.

584
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:08,148
You too work for humanity, Mr. Van.

585
00:49:08,149 --> 00:49:10,852
Me ?
Yes, you are a musician.

586
00:49:10,853 --> 00:49:13,082
That's a nice name for it.

587
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:16,470
I used to play piano in picture theatres
when that was the only sound they had...

588
00:49:16,471 --> 00:49:17,924
... except for peanuts.

589
00:49:17,926 --> 00:49:20,107
Listen to this.

590
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,859
The waters of the Minetawk...

591
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:28,615
... suitable for scenics, Niagara Falls by moonlight.

592
00:49:28,616 --> 00:49:31,358
Or if you can play it like this...

593
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:39,048
Goes fine with the scene when the young Indian Chief
turns out to be a Yale man.

594
00:49:42,049 --> 00:49:45,005
I've turned my head to about everything,
including your line of business.

595
00:49:45,006 --> 00:49:48,896
My business ?
Yeah, Dr. Maltese's elixir, the medical remedy.

596
00:49:48,897 --> 00:49:52,776
A remedy for what, may I ask ?
It was a cure for almost everything.

597
00:49:52,777 --> 00:49:56,952
All my life I've been selling phony goods
to people of meager intelligence and great faith.

598
00:49:56,953 --> 00:49:59,685
Hey Harry, have those officers come up here yet ?
Not yet.

599
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,603
Don't be discouraged.
Sit down.

600
00:50:03,604 --> 00:50:06,335
I'm feeling in a generous mood.
I'm gonna buy you all a drink.

601
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,014
What ?

602
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,521
It's only my bracelet, Achille.
Because you like them.

603
00:50:15,522 --> 00:50:21,880
My dear, there's certainly nobody else
in this dismal hotel who can appreciate your charms.

604
00:50:23,428 --> 00:50:25,080
We'll have dinner in there.

605
00:50:25,198 --> 00:50:28,659
Did you get your telephone call ?
Yes, I spoke to Falvero.

606
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,712
He was very apologetic over this delay.

607
00:50:30,713 --> 00:50:32,837
But everything is arranged for us to proceed tomorrow.

608
00:50:32,838 --> 00:50:35,392
Oh.

609
00:50:35,493 --> 00:50:39,786
I think I shall go downstairs and have a glass of vodka.

610
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:42,635
But why, we can have it sent up here.
No, Achille...

611
00:50:42,636 --> 00:50:44,978
... I would prefer to have it down there.

612
00:50:44,979 --> 00:50:46,778
With all those gentle people gaping at you ?

613
00:50:46,779 --> 00:50:50,154
I don't mind. I love people.
I shall come right back.

614
00:50:50,155 --> 00:50:52,506
I will go with you. It may be amusing.

615
00:51:02,937 --> 00:51:05,289
Good afternoon, madame.
Good afternoon, Mr. Weber.

616
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:07,067
Good afternoon, Mr. Navadel.

617
00:51:07,068 --> 00:51:13,213
It is a lovely view.
It is like a landscape on the moon.

618
00:51:17,014 --> 00:51:20,393
Get a load of that.
Isn't she gorgeous ?

619
00:51:20,394 --> 00:51:22,941
I bet you she's a duchess.
Well, anyway, a princess.

620
00:51:22,942 --> 00:51:24,973
Hey, Harry, what are you looking at ?

621
00:51:27,574 --> 00:51:29,782
She looks to me like a phony.

622
00:51:32,883 --> 00:51:34,904
Hi, Cap.

623
00:51:34,905 --> 00:51:37,681
Good afternoon, ladies.
Where's all of your boyfriends, Cap ?

624
00:51:37,682 --> 00:51:39,841
Excuse me a moment, please.

625
00:51:40,842 --> 00:51:43,235
Mr. Weber, Madame.

626
00:51:43,236 --> 00:51:45,337
Captain Kirvline, Commandant of the frontier station.

627
00:51:45,338 --> 00:51:47,393
How do you do ?
Captain.

628
00:51:47,394 --> 00:51:51,341
Just received instructions that you were here, Mr. Weber.
I am to be of assistance to you in every possibe way.

629
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:53,662
Thank you very much. Won't you join us ?
Thank you, sir.

630
00:51:53,663 --> 00:51:56,440
What would you like ?
Brandy and soda, please.

631
00:51:56,441 --> 00:51:58,905
Irena ?
Vodka, if you please.

632
00:51:58,906 --> 00:52:01,354
Vermouth for me.
If you please, sir.

633
00:52:23,528 --> 00:52:25,558
Where are they going, Achille ?

634
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,185
Probably moving to another airbase farther from the frontier.

635
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:29,963
Isn't that so, Captain ?

636
00:52:29,964 --> 00:52:32,603
Yes, I imagine so.

637
00:52:37,004 --> 00:52:41,223
Are they gonna keep that up forever ?
They're gonna have to get us some ear muffs, Harry.

638
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:44,534
Hello, Mr. Quillary. Sit down and have one.
I'm buying.

639
00:52:44,535 --> 00:52:47,243
Keep drinking and be merry, for tomorrow we starve.

640
00:52:47,244 --> 00:52:49,011
Except for breakfast.

641
00:52:49,012 --> 00:52:54,749
I've just heard some very ugly rumors down in town.
They say that war has already been declared.

642
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:57,234
Rumors, rumors, everything's rumors.
When are we going to know ?

643
00:52:57,235 --> 00:53:00,527
Soon enough, heaven help us.
But we'll stop this war.

644
00:53:00,528 --> 00:53:04,452
We'll save the human race from plunging
into a mass murder, mass suicide.

645
00:53:04,453 --> 00:53:06,515
Say, what's your line of business, Mr. Quillary ?

646
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,344
I'm a preacher, Mr. Van.
You don't say so, a preacher, huh ?

647
00:53:09,345 --> 00:53:11,223
But not in a church.

648
00:53:11,224 --> 00:53:15,750
I used to be a worker in an industry that made poison gas.
It gave me ideas.

649
00:53:15,751 --> 00:53:19,964
Since then I've gone about the world preaching
the message of peace, the brotherhood of man.

650
00:53:20,205 --> 00:53:23,275
You've got a great idea there, pal. Stick to it.

651
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,695
Did you hear what they're saying ?
I heard, but I couldn't understand.

652
00:53:37,696 --> 00:53:42,811
About the war. It's already been declared.
That means I'll go and demand
that they let me cross the border at once.

653
00:53:42,812 --> 00:53:45,901
That's right, pal. If you're gonna save the world,
you've got no time to lose.

654
00:53:45,902 --> 00:53:48,021
Harry, what's it all about ?

655
00:53:48,922 --> 00:53:50,327
I'll tell you later.

656
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:56,703
Hey, Don. Set up the music,
some of these young people wanna dance.

657
00:53:56,704 --> 00:53:59,280
Come on boys, give us a tune with a lot of oomph.

658
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:01,303
Come on, babe.

659
00:54:54,704 --> 00:54:56,968
Nothing from Berlin, except Wagner.

660
00:54:56,969 --> 00:54:59,348
Try Paris, perhaps we can get some news from there.

661
00:55:01,649 --> 00:55:04,965
There... that's from the Paris station.

662
00:55:04,966 --> 00:55:07,841
Silent. I'll try another.

663
00:55:09,842 --> 00:55:11,458
Silent.

664
00:55:11,459 --> 00:55:15,372
Try at 1016, Captain Kirvline, that's also Paris.
Thank you.

665
00:55:20,173 --> 00:55:23,677
Probably code messages
from the Ministry of War to the Army.

666
00:55:23,717 --> 00:55:25,073
If we could only read them.

667
00:55:25,674 --> 00:55:30,597
Seems to me everybody would be much happier in here
if they only knew how to make coffee.

668
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,336
There. That's a station at Prague.

669
00:55:39,637 --> 00:55:42,592
Do you understand any of that, Achille ?

670
00:55:42,593 --> 00:55:45,705
No, not a word.
Neither do I.

671
00:55:45,706 --> 00:55:48,008
Can I suggest you try London ?

672
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:54,498
"And now to conclude our news program,
we shall give you the results of the day's
more important football matches.

673
00:55:54,499 --> 00:55:57,573
Sheffield United 2, Birmingham 1.

674
00:55:57,574 --> 00:56:00,684
England is England still.

675
00:56:00,685 --> 00:56:02,425
I'll try and get through.
Will the wires be open, Captain ?

676
00:56:02,426 --> 00:56:05,348
Yes, I'll try to arrange it, Mr. Weber.
Irena.

677
00:56:05,349 --> 00:56:08,183
I'll be up presently, Achille.
Madame.

678
00:56:18,184 --> 00:56:21,776
You look unhappy, Mr. and Mrs. Cherry.

679
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,347
I'm afraid so, but it's difficult to be
cheerful under these circumstances, isn't it ?

680
00:56:26,348 --> 00:56:31,035
You must forget the circumstances.
Come here and drink some vodka with me.

681
00:56:31,036 --> 00:56:32,809
We'd love to.

682
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:38,488
I've never tasted vodka before.
Then it is high time.

683
00:56:39,689 --> 00:56:43,175
And your friend, I do not know his name.

684
00:56:43,176 --> 00:56:45,967
Oh, Mr. Van, may I present Madame... Madame...

685
00:56:45,968 --> 00:56:48,734
How do you do ?
Glad to make your acquaintance, Madame.

686
00:56:48,735 --> 00:56:51,429
You will join us in a glass of vodka ?

687
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:53,071
Thank you.

688
00:56:53,072 --> 00:56:55,274
Three glasses, August.
Yes, Madame.

689
00:56:55,275 --> 00:56:57,646
Please sit down, Mr. Van.

690
00:57:00,647 --> 00:57:04,230
I know why you're depressed, Mrs. Cherry.

691
00:57:04,231 --> 00:57:06,404
It is the altitude.
After the first exhileration,

692
00:57:06,405 --> 00:57:11,404
... there comes a depressive reaction

693
00:57:11,405 --> 00:57:16,626
Especially for you, who are accostumed to the heavy
"Pigwigean" atmosphere of England.

694
00:57:16,627 --> 00:57:20,748
"Pigwiggean" ?
Yes, "Pigwig". Oliver Twist.

695
00:57:20,749 --> 00:57:23,652
You know, your Dickens.
You know England, Madame ?

696
00:57:23,653 --> 00:57:25,694
Of course I know England.

697
00:57:25,695 --> 00:57:29,175
My governess was a sweet old ogre from your north country.

698
00:57:29,176 --> 00:57:35,605
And when I was a little girl, I used to visit often at Sandringham.
Sandringham ?

699
00:57:35,606 --> 00:57:40,544
Yes, but that was before your time.

700
00:57:40,545 --> 00:57:47,136
It was in the reign of dear, gay King Edward
and his beautiful Alexandra.

701
00:57:50,537 --> 00:57:54,877
I used to have such fun playing with my cousin David.

702
00:57:54,878 --> 00:57:57,416
He used to try to teach me to play cricket.

703
00:57:57,417 --> 00:58:03,596
And when I couldn't swing the bat properly he said,
"Oh, you Russians will never be civilized."

704
00:58:05,397 --> 00:58:12,958
And when I went home to Petersburg,
I told to my uncle what David had said
and he was so amused.

705
00:58:18,759 --> 00:58:22,009
But now we must drink our vodka.

706
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:25,470
With your permission.

707
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:31,087
I drink to his most gracious majesty the King,

708
00:58:31,088 --> 00:58:36,928
... and the President of your United States.
Thanks, I'm sure he'll appreciate that.

709
00:58:36,929 --> 00:58:38,729
Now...

710
00:58:41,306 --> 00:58:45,752
No, no. You must drink it right down.
Like this.

711
00:58:48,253 --> 00:58:49,546
So.

712
00:58:49,547 --> 00:58:53,920
There, you see ?
The second glass will go more easily.

713
00:58:53,921 --> 00:58:55,472
I hope so.

714
00:58:55,473 --> 00:58:59,531
You are not married for a long time ?
We were married the day before yesterday.

715
00:58:59,532 --> 00:59:04,023
No ! How thrilling !
Let me offer my congratulations.

716
00:59:04,024 --> 00:59:08,252
Thank you very much.
We were married in Florence, you see.
I've been studying painting there.

717
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:10,856
We both love Italy.
How wonderful.

718
00:59:10,857 --> 00:59:14,257
Florence is the most perfect place to be married in.

719
00:59:14,258 --> 00:59:19,545
Don't you think so, Mr. Van ?
I guess any place is perfect for that purpose.

720
00:59:19,546 --> 00:59:26,353
Oh, no. Not your America.
Too dull. Too much business. Not enough romance.

721
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:29,707
You've been in America ?
Oh, yes.

722
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:33,937
I have seen it all.
New York, Washington, Palm Beach.

723
00:59:33,938 --> 00:59:36,615
No, no, I said America.

724
00:59:36,616 --> 00:59:40,144
Have you ever been in the West ?
Certainly, I have.

725
00:59:40,145 --> 00:59:42,336
I flew across your continent.

726
00:59:42,337 --> 00:59:50,647
Did you ever make any parachute landings
in any places like Kansas or Iowa ?

727
00:59:50,648 --> 00:59:52,507
Or Nebraska ?

728
00:59:52,508 --> 00:59:57,337
No. On that flight I had no parachute.

729
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,095
You like the vodka now ?
It feels marvelous. In here.

730
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,099
I used to laugh so at your funny British Tommies in your country.

731
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:14,365
They all hated vodka
until one of them thought of mixing it with beer.

732
01:00:14,366 --> 01:00:17,238
How awful !
It was.

733
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:22,474
But I shall be forever grateful to them, those Tommies.

734
01:00:22,475 --> 01:00:26,484
They saved my life when I escaped from the Soviets.

735
01:00:26,485 --> 01:00:30,079
For days and nights, I don't know how many...

736
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:33,990
... I was driving through the snow.
Snow, snow, snow, snow...

737
01:00:33,991 --> 01:00:35,876
... in a little sleigh...

738
01:00:35,877 --> 01:00:38,722
... with the dead body of my father beside me.

739
01:00:38,723 --> 01:00:43,493
I was in agony from the bayonet boons of the Bolsheviki.

740
01:00:43,495 --> 01:00:48,020
And the wolves were running along like an escort of dragoons.

741
01:00:48,021 --> 01:00:50,575
You must have been dreadfully afraid.
Oh, no.

742
01:00:50,576 --> 01:00:53,132
I was not afraid for myself.

743
01:00:53,133 --> 01:00:55,709
It was the thought of my father.

744
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:59,332
Oh, please. I know you don't want to talk about it any more.

745
01:00:59,334 --> 01:01:01,547
Oh, no. It is so far away now.

746
01:01:01,548 --> 01:01:06,120
But I shall never forget the moment
when I came to through the haze of delirium...

747
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:09,415
... and saw the faces of those Tommies...

748
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:17,089
... those simple, friendly faces.
And the snow, the wolves and the terrible cold,
they were all gone.

749
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:21,064
And I was looking at Kew Gardens.
It was a Sunday afternoon.

750
01:01:21,065 --> 01:01:26,999
A sea of golden daffodils
fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

751
01:01:29,098 --> 01:01:35,534
In the face of real danger,
one forgets to be afraid, don't you think so, Mr. Van ?

752
01:01:35,535 --> 01:01:36,987
I don't know.

753
01:01:36,988 --> 01:01:39,809
I was scared stiff once.

754
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:43,468
It was when I was working with a mindreading act.
Really ?

755
01:01:43,469 --> 01:01:46,686
You mean you read people's minds ?
Sure.

756
01:01:46,687 --> 01:01:50,433
I can see right through'em.
Oh !

757
01:01:50,434 --> 01:01:54,757
How embarassing.
I was playing a week in Omaha.

758
01:01:54,758 --> 01:01:58,246
Have you ever been in Omaha, Madame ?

759
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:00,357
Omaha ?

760
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:02,613
Omaha.

761
01:02:02,614 --> 01:02:05,237
Where is that ?
Persia ?

762
01:02:05,238 --> 01:02:08,269
It's in Nebraska.
That's one of our States.

763
01:02:08,771 --> 01:02:14,300
If you please, madame,
Mr. Weber would like to see you, if convenient.
Thank you.

764
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:19,315
You must tell me later about that mindreading, Mr. Van.

765
01:02:19,316 --> 01:02:21,804
Whenever you're free.

766
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:24,553
And do finish the vodka, all of it.

767
01:02:24,554 --> 01:02:28,029
Thank you very much, Madame.
It will help you both so much.

768
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:37,019
She's an amazing woman, isn't she ?
Amazing is a feeble word for her.

769
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:40,355
Well did you get them to call off the war ?

770
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:43,174
I only learned that
when the borders are opened we'll be notified.

771
01:02:43,175 --> 01:02:47,243
Is there any news ?
Not in this patriotic journal.

772
01:02:47,244 --> 01:02:52,292
Unconfirmed reports from Vienna,
London, Rome, Berlin, Moscow, Tokyo.

773
01:02:52,293 --> 01:02:55,668
Not a confirmed line from the local censored press.

774
01:02:55,669 --> 01:03:00,983
If you want to know what is really happening
you must ask the great Mr. Achille Weber upstairs

775
01:03:00,984 --> 01:03:03,735
He can give you all the war news because he made it.

776
01:03:03,736 --> 01:03:06,647
You don't know who the great Mr. Achille Weber is, do you ?

777
01:03:06,648 --> 01:03:08,709
Well, I'll tell you.

778
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:12,890
He's been organizing the arms industry.
Munitions for murder.

779
01:03:12,891 --> 01:03:20,321
In every part of the world,
the good desires of men for peace and decency
is undermined by the dynamite of ingenuism.

780
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:25,666
So it takes only a spark set off anywhere to send it up into one fatal explosion.

781
01:03:25,667 --> 01:03:31,446
Then love becomes hatred,
courage becomes terror and hope becomes despair.

782
01:03:31,447 --> 01:03:37,353
And it's very nice for Mr. Achille Weber,
because he is master of the one real League of Nations...

783
01:03:37,354 --> 01:03:38,880
... the League of the Merchants of Death.

784
01:03:38,882 --> 01:03:40,613
Nonsense.
Who speaks ?
I speak.

785
01:03:40,614 --> 01:03:42,388
The eminent Dr. Hugo Waldersee.

786
01:03:42,389 --> 01:03:45,351
If you love your country so much,
why aren't you there now with your rats ?

787
01:03:45,352 --> 01:03:47,759
I am not concerned with politics, I'm a scientist.

788
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,190
That's right, Herr Doktor, you are a scientist.
And a servant of the people.

789
01:03:51,191 --> 01:03:55,384
And yet you know that if you were in your own country,
you'd have to abandon your cure for cancer.

790
01:03:55,385 --> 01:03:57,285
It might benefit too many people.

791
01:03:57,286 --> 01:03:59,680
Your duty would be not to cure, but to kill.

792
01:03:59,681 --> 01:04:03,955
You and your fight against disease and death
would be a Judas goat in a slaughterhouse.

793
01:04:03,956 --> 01:04:06,938
I say, Quillary, do you have to have
so much talk about blood just before dinner ?

794
01:04:06,939 --> 01:04:09,441
Just before dinner ?
That's all you worry about.

795
01:04:09,442 --> 01:04:13,908
What do you care that civilization is falling to pieces,
as long as you have your dinner in your dinner jacket ?

796
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:16,200
I'm sorry, Quillary, I think we'd better conclude the discussion out on the terrace.

797
01:04:16,201 --> 01:04:18,134
Jimmy, don't be a fool, you'll gain nothing by this discussion.

798
01:04:18,135 --> 01:04:21,143
Mr. Cherry, I'm at your disposal.
If you can't discuss this as a gentleman, Mr. Quillary...

799
01:04:21,144 --> 01:04:25,111
Now listen, folks. There's no reason for any heat
under the collar. We're all buddies here.

800
01:04:25,112 --> 01:04:31,126
Mr. Van is right. There's no reason for any heat.
My apologies, Mr. Cherry.

801
01:04:31,127 --> 01:04:32,624
That's all right, old man.

802
01:04:32,794 --> 01:04:34,510
Come and have a drink.
Thank you.

803
01:04:34,511 --> 01:04:39,006
My apologies to you too, Herr Doktor.
I ask for no apologizing.

804
01:04:39,007 --> 01:04:43,363
I let my speach run away with me
because I have hatred for certain things.

805
01:04:43,364 --> 01:04:45,243
You should hate them too.

806
01:04:45,244 --> 01:04:47,681
They are the things that make us blind.

807
01:04:47,682 --> 01:04:50,375
And ignorant, and dirty.

808
01:05:03,476 --> 01:05:06,394
How would it be if I and the girls
put on part of our acts here tonight ?

809
01:05:06,395 --> 01:05:10,822
For the purpose of wholesome merriment.
And relieveing the general tension.

810
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:12,593
What kind of an act is it ?

811
01:05:12,594 --> 01:05:16,031
Don't say what kind of act is it in that tone of voice.
Good enough for this place.

812
01:05:16,032 --> 01:05:20,625
We'll omit the bubble dance.
But I can have Bebe do the hula number
if there's a special request for it.

813
01:05:20,626 --> 01:05:23,389
Do you  expect to get paid for this ?
Certainly not. I'm offering this
out of the the goodness of my heart.

814
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:27,041
Of course if you care to make any
appropriate adjustments on the hotel bills...

815
01:05:27,042 --> 01:05:29,189
Ok, Mr. Van, if you think you can entertain us.

816
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:31,488
I'll get the girls ready.
What time do you want the show to go on ?

817
01:05:31,489 --> 01:05:33,269
After we eat.

818
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:35,147
They've what ?

819
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,520
Just as I thought.
Those bombers have gone off on an air raid.

820
01:05:43,521 --> 01:05:46,451
The one mad dog act of violence
all Europe has been fearing.

821
01:05:46,452 --> 01:05:48,606
The the next war has started, Achille ?

822
01:05:48,607 --> 01:05:51,659
With avengeance.
But I thought you said they will not fight.

823
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:54,155
No one could predict what they would do in their desperation.

824
01:05:54,156 --> 01:05:56,812
We must get out of here quickly.
I will send some telegrams.

825
01:05:56,813 --> 01:05:59,860
It'll soon be found out that some of the bombers
came from this airbase.

826
01:05:59,861 --> 01:06:03,414
Tomorrow night they'll come over here for revenge.
That will be exciting to see.

827
01:06:03,415 --> 01:06:06,999
What, an air raid ?
Yes. With bombs bursting in the snow.

828
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,512
Sending up great great geysers of diamonds.

829
01:06:09,513 --> 01:06:12,586
Great geysers of us perhaps.
No, my dear, we leave at once for Biarritz.

830
01:06:12,587 --> 01:06:13,954
It's healthier there.

831
01:06:13,955 --> 01:06:17,148
I can imagine how thrilling it must be in Paris at this moment.

832
01:06:17,149 --> 01:06:22,779
Just like 1914.
All the lovely soldiers singing, marching, marching.

833
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:26,499
I am so happy for you, Achille.
What, my dear ?

834
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:29,490
I said I am so happy for you.
Happy, why ?

835
01:06:29,491 --> 01:06:33,039
All this wonderful death and destruction everywhere

836
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,299
And you promoted it.

837
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:38,581
You have a superb imagination, my dear.

838
01:06:38,582 --> 01:06:42,039
It's the quality in you that fascinates me most.

839
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:47,383
It's what has made you such a brilliant and admirable liar,
and all very helpful to me.

840
01:06:47,384 --> 01:06:50,171
Am I right ?
Of course you're right, Achille.

841
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:56,622
Had I been bound by any self-respect for the truth
I should never have escaped from the Soviets.
I'm sure of it.

842
01:06:56,525 --> 01:06:59,588
Did I ever tell of my escape from the Soviets ?

843
01:06:59,589 --> 01:07:03,557
You've told me about it at least eleven times
and every time it was different.
Well...

844
01:07:03,558 --> 01:07:05,563
... I made several escapes.

845
01:07:11,164 --> 01:07:13,758
I am always making escapes, Achille.

846
01:07:14,459 --> 01:07:17,598
When I'm worrying about you and your career,

847
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:21,198
... I have to run away from the terror of my own thoughts.

848
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:24,941
I amuse myself by studying the faces of the people I see.

849
01:07:24,942 --> 01:07:27,903
Ordinary, casual, dull people.

850
01:07:27,904 --> 01:07:30,354
That little English couple, for instance.

851
01:07:30,355 --> 01:07:34,498
I was watching them during dinner,
sitting there close together holding hands.

852
01:07:34,499 --> 01:07:38,798
And I saw him in his nice, smart British uniform...

853
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:42,356
... shooting a little pistol at a huge tank.

854
01:07:42,357 --> 01:07:46,174
And a tank rolls over him...

855
01:07:46,176 --> 01:07:51,249
... and his fine, strong body
that was so full of the capacity for ecstasy...

856
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:55,278
... is a mass of mashed flesh and bones...

857
01:07:55,279 --> 01:08:00,103
... a smear of purple blood, like a stepped-on snail.

858
01:08:00,104 --> 01:08:05,641
But before the moment of death,
he consoles himself by thinking...

859
01:08:05,642 --> 01:08:08,481
... thank God she is safe.

860
01:08:08,482 --> 01:08:11,451
She is bearing the child I gave her.

861
01:08:11,452 --> 01:08:14,985
And he will live to see a better world.

862
01:08:14,986 --> 01:08:19,252
But I know where she is.

863
01:08:19,253 --> 01:08:23,430
She is under a house that has been wrecked by an air raid.

864
01:08:23,431 --> 01:08:26,232
She is as dead as he is.

865
01:08:26,233 --> 01:08:30,070
But he died in action against the enemy gloriously.

866
01:08:30,071 --> 01:08:33,794
But she died in a cellar....

867
01:08:33,795 --> 01:08:36,314
... not so very gloriously.

868
01:08:37,515 --> 01:08:41,986
There will be many who will die that way in this war,
won't there, Achille ?

869
01:08:41,987 --> 01:08:45,742
You don't say anything.

870
01:08:45,743 --> 01:08:47,861
Probably you are bored.

871
01:08:47,862 --> 01:08:51,415
But I like to think about these things, Achille.

872
01:08:51,416 --> 01:08:56,557
And it makes me so proud to think that I am so close to you...

873
01:08:56,558 --> 01:08:59,871
... who makes all this possible.

874
01:08:59,872 --> 01:09:02,894
That's all very interesting, my dear.

875
01:09:02,895 --> 01:09:07,077
But before you waste too much sympathy
on these little people, like your English friends,

876
01:09:07,078 --> 01:09:10,102
just ask yourself this:
Why shouldn't they die ?

877
01:09:10,103 --> 01:09:14,981
And who are the greater criminals ?
Those who sell the instruments of death
or those who buy them and use them ?

878
01:09:14,982 --> 01:09:18,356
It is they who make war seem noble and heroic.

879
01:09:18,357 --> 01:09:20,183
And what does it all amount to ?

880
01:09:20,184 --> 01:09:25,681
Mistrust of the motives of everyone else. A dog in the manger in defense of all they've got.
Greed for the other fellow's possessions.

881
01:09:30,002 --> 01:09:32,267
I assure you, Irena.

882
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:36,203
For such little people,
the deadliest weapons are the most merciful.

883
01:09:42,404 --> 01:09:45,718
Quiet. Ladies and gentlemen, quiet, please.

884
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:47,164
Thank you so much.

885
01:09:47,165 --> 01:09:52,726
The management of the hotel Montaloda
has the privilege and the  pleasure
of presenting for your entertainment tonight...

886
01:09:53,071 --> 01:09:55,291
A troupe of outstanding American artists...

887
01:09:55,292 --> 01:10:00,140
... who have lately been touring Europe scoring notable triumphs
in Monte Carlo and other centers of gaiety.

888
01:10:00,141 --> 01:10:04,509
I know that you will join with us in giving a
really rousing, rip-roaring reception...

889
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:07,384
... to Harry Van and Les Blondes.
Mr. Van.

890
01:10:10,685 --> 01:10:13,760
Hello, people, and thank you Don for
the very lovely introduction you gave us...

891
01:10:13,761 --> 01:10:16,447
All I can say is thanks a million
and I won't settle for a cent less.

892
01:10:16,448 --> 01:10:21,017
In our modest act tonight we'll be ably assisted
by Professor Polovan and his talented little team.

893
01:10:21,018 --> 01:10:22,913
Give him a hand, folks.

894
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,995
Please remember, we haven't have much time for rehearsal
so I pray for your indulgence as the rhythm isn't all strictly kosher.

895
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,707
Thanks for that laugh, pal.
Thank you very much indeed.

896
01:10:33,708 --> 01:10:38,867
All I ask of you is that Christian pearl of charity,
to quote our great American poet John Greenleaf Wittier.

897
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:40,461
Give him a hand, folks.

898
01:10:40,462 --> 01:10:42,648
Okeedokee, play it away.

899
01:10:44,749 --> 01:10:48,580
It will be amusing, Achille.
I hope so.

900
01:10:51,481 --> 01:10:54,311
If you're blue
And you dont know where to go to

901
01:10:54,312 --> 01:10:58,975
Why don't you go where Harlem sits
Puttin' on the Ritz

902
01:10:58,976 --> 01:11:07,145
Spangled gowns upon a bevy of high browns
From down the levee, all misfits
Puttin' on the Ritz

903
01:11:07,746 --> 01:11:16,452
That's where each and every lulubelle goes
Ev'ry Thursday evening with her swell beaus
Rubbing elbows

904
01:11:16,453 --> 01:11:23,544
Come with me and we'll attend their jubilee
And see them spend their last two bits
Puttin' on the Ritz

905
01:11:43,845 --> 01:11:46,115
Bravo ! Bravo !

906
01:11:46,116 --> 01:11:50,740
Hear that applause ?
Come on.

907
01:11:50,741 --> 01:11:59,441
If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where Harlem sits
Puttin' on the Ritz

908
01:12:00,642 --> 01:12:07,828
Spangled gowns upon a bevy of high browns
From down the levee, all misfits
Puttin' on the Ritz

909
01:12:07,829 --> 01:12:13,651
That's where each and every lulubelle goes...

910
01:12:13,652 --> 01:12:19,271
I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Van,
for interrupting your entertainment like this but...

911
01:12:19,272 --> 01:12:22,458
.. after your charming young ladies have changed, I wonder...

912
01:12:22,459 --> 01:12:25,507
... do you think they could be persuaded
to have a drink with my comrades ?

913
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:29,182
Yes, I think they could.
Tell the boys to sit down.

914
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:31,192
After this next number girls, you can join the army.

915
01:12:34,293 --> 01:12:37,321
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, our next number...

916
01:12:37,322 --> 01:12:44,122
... will be a solo presentation by Miss Bebe Gould entitled
"Shame on You ".
Hit it again.

917
01:12:45,523 --> 01:12:49,007
Shame on you
you loveless lover...

918
01:12:49,008 --> 01:12:55,373
I wake up so you discover
someone making eyes and taking you right out of my blue arms.

919
01:12:55,374 --> 01:12:57,808
Shame on you
It isn't funny

920
01:12:57,809 --> 01:12:59,690
Have you heard the news ?
No. What happened ?

921
01:12:59,691 --> 01:13:02,713
There's been an air raid. A terrible air raid.
Shh. There's an entertainment going on here.

922
01:13:02,714 --> 01:13:07,268
Entertainment ?
While tens of thousands of innocent
people are dead or dying, an entertainment ?

923
01:13:07,269 --> 01:13:09,835
If you cannot keep quiet, I must ask you to leave.

924
01:13:09,836 --> 01:13:11,484
Keep it up girls, keep it up.

925
01:13:11,485 --> 01:13:15,297
Tonight they dropped 50.000 kilos of terrible death...

926
01:13:15,298 --> 01:13:18,126
This is no time for a news bulletin.
How do you know this ?

927
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:21,144
It's on the wire, it's everywhere.
And I just talked to one of the mechanics...

928
01:13:21,145 --> 01:13:23,330
The planes from that very field down there...

929
01:13:23,331 --> 01:13:25,613
Sit down, will you, pal ?
We're trying to give a little entertainment.

930
01:13:25,614 --> 01:13:30,054
While you sit here eating and drinking,
airplanes drop 50.000 kilos of bombs on innocent people.

931
01:13:30,055 --> 01:13:34,930
Heaven knows how many were killed.
How much of life and beauty is forever destroyed...

932
01:13:34,931 --> 01:13:37,884
... and you sit here eating and drinking with them, the murderers.

933
01:13:37,885 --> 01:13:41,472
With their planes from that very field down there.
Assassins !

934
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:45,454
Here, here, we can't have any skull cracking in this club.
Captain, speak to your men before they attack him.

935
01:13:45,455 --> 01:13:50,576
I'll take charge.
Jimmy, you keep out of this.
I curse you, assassins !

936
01:13:50,577 --> 01:13:53,399
Now, listen, pal.
Harry, don't get yourself mixed up in this mess.

937
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,547
We stand together.
It's all right, Captain. I can handle this.
Now stop shooting off your face.

938
01:13:56,548 --> 01:13:59,252
We curse you and curse the villain wthat sent you
on this errand of death.

939
01:13:59,253 --> 01:14:01,853
Mr. Quillary, if you don't shut your mouth
I'll be forced to arrest you.

940
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:05,226
Go on, you toy soldiers, commit national suicide.
It's the last gesture left to you.

941
01:14:05,227 --> 01:14:07,872
It's all right, Captain.
Mr. Quillary's for peace.
He's going home to stop the war.

942
01:14:07,873 --> 01:14:10,798
You're not authorized to speak for me.
I'm competent to say what I feel.

943
01:14:10,799 --> 01:14:13,484
And what I say is he that taketh up the sword
shall die by the sword.

944
01:14:13,485 --> 01:14:15,527
And you too shall die, murderers !

945
01:14:15,528 --> 01:14:17,325
Mr. Quillary, you are under arrest.

946
01:14:17,326 --> 01:14:19,582
Go on, call out the firing squads !
Shoot me dead.

947
01:14:19,583 --> 01:14:21,616
But don't think you can silence the truth that's in me.

948
01:14:21,467 --> 01:14:24,499
Down with your Germany murderers.

949
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:27,781
Shoot me ! Go on, shoot me.

950
01:14:27,782 --> 01:14:31,214
Excuse me, my dear. Some important business.
I'll leave you with your charming friends.

951
01:14:31,215 --> 01:14:34,156
Better carry on your turn, old man.
No, the act is called.

952
01:14:34,157 --> 01:14:38,561
Hey, maestro, give us some dance music.
Let dancing become general.

953
01:14:57,349 --> 01:14:59,116
Will you dance with me ?

954
01:14:59,117 --> 01:15:02,493
Why, yes. I should love it.

955
01:15:31,994 --> 01:15:39,306
The horrors of that terrible journey had broken his body.
but his spirit was strong.

956
01:15:39,307 --> 01:15:42,616
The spirit that is Russian.

957
01:15:42,617 --> 01:15:46,066
He lay there in that little boat...

958
01:15:46,067 --> 01:15:48,005
... and he looked up at me...

959
01:15:48,006 --> 01:15:53,700
Never can I forget his face.
So pale, so white.

960
01:15:53,701 --> 01:15:56,776
So beautiful in the starry night.

961
01:15:56,777 --> 01:15:59,866
And he said to me...

962
01:15:59,867 --> 01:16:03,357
Irena, little daughter...

963
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:07,397
And then... he died.

964
01:16:07,398 --> 01:16:13,984
For four days I was alone with his body.
Sailing through the storms of the Black Sea.

965
01:16:13,985 --> 01:16:20,382
I had no food, no water.
I was in agony from the
bayonet boons of the Bolsheviki,

966
01:16:20,456 --> 01:16:23,285
I knew I must die.

967
01:16:23,286 --> 01:16:32,523
But then an American cruiser rescued me.
May heaven bless those good men.

968
01:16:32,524 --> 01:16:37,939
Excuse me, madame, but it seems to me
the last time you told me about your escape
it was different.

969
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:41,457
Well, I made several escapes.

970
01:16:41,458 --> 01:16:46,422
But I have talked too much about myself.
What about you, my friend ?

971
01:16:46,423 --> 01:16:50,288
I'm not very interesting.
I'm just what I seem to be.

972
01:16:50,289 --> 01:16:55,797
Really ?
Why do you waste yourself in degraded work ?

973
01:16:55,798 --> 01:16:58,813
You think I'm fitted for something
that requires more mentality ?

974
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:01,898
Of course.
How do you know so much about me ?

975
01:17:01,899 --> 01:17:05,535
For one thing, I saw your performance tonight.
You thought it was rotten ?

976
01:17:05,536 --> 01:17:08,998
I thought it was unworthy.
Unfortunately it was interrupted.

977
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:10,340
I saw enough.

978
01:17:10,341 --> 01:17:15,396
You are a very bad dancer.
In Romania they thought I was pretty good.

979
01:17:17,097 --> 01:17:19,736
Do you know that you can be extremely rude ?

980
01:17:19,737 --> 01:17:21,137
Me ? How ?

981
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:24,090
Why do you stare at me so ?
Was I staring ?

982
01:17:24,091 --> 01:17:27,406
Steadily. Ever since I arrived here this morning.

983
01:17:27,407 --> 01:17:28,994
Why do you do it ?

984
01:17:28,995 --> 01:17:35,305
Well, I thought I detected a funny kind of resemblance
to somebody I used to know.

985
01:17:37,306 --> 01:17:42,092
You should know better than to tell any woman
that she resembles someone else.

986
01:17:42,093 --> 01:17:47,570
We none of us like to think that our appearence is commonplace.

987
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:50,816
The one you looked like wasn't commonplace.
Oh !

988
01:17:50,817 --> 01:17:54,145
She was someone dear and dear to you ?

989
01:17:54,146 --> 01:17:57,799
She occupies a unique shrine in the temple of my memory.

990
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:02,027
Really ?
That is a glowing tribute.

991
01:18:02,028 --> 01:18:06,493
The temple of your memory must be so crowded.

992
01:18:06,494 --> 01:18:09,912
Are you sure you've never been in Omaha, Madame ?

993
01:18:09,913 --> 01:18:11,831
Omaha.

994
01:18:11,832 --> 01:18:14,660
Oh, yes !

995
01:18:14,661 --> 01:18:19,152
That is where you said you did...
What was it ?

996
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:21,969
Mind reading.
Of course.

997
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:27,476
No, I'm afraid I do not know your Omaha.

998
01:18:27,477 --> 01:18:32,375
But I have seen enough of your countrymen
to know that you are typical.

999
01:18:32,376 --> 01:18:35,020
I'm not typical of anything.
Oh, yes you are.

1000
01:18:35,021 --> 01:18:38,579
You are an ingenious, sentimental idealist.

1001
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:42,509
You believe in the goodness of human nature, don't you ?

1002
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:45,244
You can call that sentimental, Mrs. Weber, but it's true.

1003
01:18:45,245 --> 01:18:48,391
Forgive me, but that is not my name.
Oh, I thought you...

1004
01:18:48,392 --> 01:18:54,009
I know what you thought.
Mr. Weber and I are associated
in a sort of business way.

1005
01:18:54,010 --> 01:18:56,926
I see. Business is pretty good, isn't it ?

1006
01:19:08,527 --> 01:19:12,523
But it is getting late,
and I am keeping you from your duties.

1007
01:19:12,524 --> 01:19:15,554
I haven't got any duties.
Hello, Harry. How are we doing ?

1008
01:19:15,555 --> 01:19:18,229
Shouldn't you be worried about your young ladies ?

1009
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:21,138
I thought you were supposed to be the chaperone.

1010
01:19:21,139 --> 01:19:23,299
I leave the girls to their own resources.

1011
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,708
Of which they have plenty.
Ah-ha.

1012
01:19:31,909 --> 01:19:35,117
There you are, staring at me again.

1013
01:19:35,118 --> 01:19:38,205
I was just thinking.
You said you were interested in aviation.

1014
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:43,745
So was the girl I knew in Omaha.
She swung from the tail of a tin aeroplane by her teeth.

1015
01:19:43,746 --> 01:19:47,371
What an extraordinary way to make a living.

1016
01:19:47,372 --> 01:19:50,690
Excuse me, were you always a blonde ?

1017
01:19:50,691 --> 01:19:54,972
Why, yes. As far back as I can remember.

1018
01:19:54,973 --> 01:19:59,887
But that other one, the one I remind you of,
was she blond ?

1019
01:19:59,888 --> 01:20:03,187
She had red hair.
But I suspected even that.

1020
01:20:04,188 --> 01:20:06,786
Tell me, what was she like ?

1021
01:20:06,789 --> 01:20:09,766
She said she was a graduate of the University of Vienna.

1022
01:20:09,767 --> 01:20:13,348
And she was the fanciest liar I ever knew.

1023
01:20:13,349 --> 01:20:19,167
She sounds fascinating.
She was a pest.
One night she broke up the mindreading act.

1024
01:20:19,168 --> 01:20:21,395
And then she had the nerve
to ask me to teach her the code.

1025
01:20:21,396 --> 01:20:23,065
I had a terrible time getting rid of her.

1026
01:20:23,066 --> 01:20:25,126
She even forced her way into my room at the hotel.

1027
01:20:25,127 --> 01:20:30,058
Oh, dear !
I hope you didn't teach her the code.

1028
01:20:30,059 --> 01:20:33,317
But I really must go now.

1029
01:20:33,318 --> 01:20:36,241
Do you know any Russian songs ?

1030
01:20:36,242 --> 01:20:42,457
Oh, yes. When I was a little girl, my father
used to engage Chaliapin to come often to our house.

1031
01:20:42,458 --> 01:20:44,638
He taught me many songs.

1032
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:49,975
Hm, Chaliapin. Your father spared no expense.
That was in old Russia.

1033
01:20:51,176 --> 01:20:53,479
Do you know this one ?

1034
01:20:56,780 --> 01:20:59,011
Oh ! Kaak Strana.

1035
01:20:59,012 --> 01:21:02,385
How Strange.

1036
01:21:02,386 --> 01:21:05,298
How strange...

1037
01:21:31,599 --> 01:21:33,521
What did you say your name was ?
Irena.

1038
01:21:34,622 --> 01:21:37,765
How do you spell it ?
I-R-E-N-E.

1039
01:21:38,083 --> 01:21:41,157
That's it. Irene !
But why ?

1040
01:21:41,158 --> 01:21:42,842
I knew it. You're the one.

1041
01:21:42,843 --> 01:21:47,302
What one ?
That redheaded liar, Irene. I knew I couldn't be mistaken.

1042
01:21:47,303 --> 01:21:52,676
Ah, there are so many by that name.
Not like you, babe.

1043
01:21:52,677 --> 01:21:56,486
Everything fits, the name, the face,
the voice, Chaliapin, old Russia...

1044
01:21:57,787 --> 01:22:01,622
Certainly it's you.
And there's no use shaking your head...

1045
01:22:01,623 --> 01:22:08,268
No matter how much you lie you can't wipe out
the memory of the Royal Grand Hotel in Omaha.

1046
01:22:08,325 --> 01:22:09,725
The what Hotel ?

1047
01:22:10,858 --> 01:22:14,523
Go ahead and laugh,
that blond hair had me fooled for a minute...

1048
01:22:14,524 --> 01:22:17,801
... but it's just as phony as that parachute jump into the jungle.

1049
01:22:17,802 --> 01:22:22,490
Oh, you amuse me.
It's a pleasure to be entertaining,
but you can't get away with it.

1050
01:22:22,491 --> 01:22:25,053
You amuse me very much indeed.

1051
01:22:25,054 --> 01:22:30,672
Here we are, on a mountain peak in bedlam.
Tonight war is breaking over the world...

1052
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:37,543
And all you worry about is whether
I am a girl you once met casually in Omahahaha.

1053
01:22:37,544 --> 01:22:40,233
Hahaha, did I say it was casual ?

1054
01:22:40,245 --> 01:22:48,078
Oh, it is amusing. Sure it is, it's absolutely sizefitting.
but don't think for one minute there's any more doubt in my mind.
I've got you tagged.

1055
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:53,210
Good night, my friend, my bonnie friend.

1056
01:22:55,411 --> 01:23:02,246
Good night.
And thank you for making me laugh so much tonight.

1057
01:23:04,447 --> 01:23:07,257
And what did you say was the name of that hotel ?

1058
01:23:07,258 --> 01:23:11,055
The Royal Grand.
Oh, yes...

1059
01:23:12,956 --> 01:23:19,910
The Royal Grand.
You may recall it had one of those
old air-conditioned elevators just like this one.

1060
01:23:21,711 --> 01:23:24,415
The Royal Grand.

1061
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:27,771
The Royal Grand.

1062
01:23:28,739 --> 01:23:30,738
They're mine. Thank you, Harry dear.

1063
01:23:30,939 --> 01:23:33,412
I couldn't believe we were leaving a place
without one of you overlooking something.

1064
01:23:33,413 --> 01:23:36,537
Now, we're going to Geneva, girls.
It's a very important city and we've gotta make good.

1065
01:23:36,538 --> 01:23:38,929
If we're good there, we're all set for London and Paris.

1066
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:42,077
Maybe we'll make enough money to get us home.
Oh, don't speak of such a thing.

1067
01:23:42,078 --> 01:23:44,636
Home.
To give our real decent head a rest again.

1068
01:23:44,637 --> 01:23:48,337
I reached a decision last night about the act.

1069
01:23:48,338 --> 01:23:49,620
What is it, Harry ?

1070
01:23:49,621 --> 01:23:54,868
From now on I do no more dancing.
Why ? What ?
We gotta have you in the routine, Harry.

1071
01:23:54,869 --> 01:23:57,328
I've decided hoofing hurts me. It's undignified.

1072
01:23:57,329 --> 01:24:00,026
From now on I devote myself to the more intelectual side of the act.

1073
01:24:00,027 --> 01:24:03,310
And, of course, the negotiations of contract.
What made you decide that, Harry ?

1074
01:24:03,311 --> 01:24:05,134
I'm a thinker, not a performer.

1075
01:24:05,135 --> 01:24:08,348
Say, what were you talking about to that Russian number ?

1076
01:24:08,349 --> 01:24:12,599
We discussed world conditions.
Oh. And how are world conditions ?

1077
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:16,366
Hello, girls. I just want to tell you that orders have come through.

1078
01:24:16,367 --> 01:24:19,131
The frontier will be open at 5 o'clock and we'll all be allowed to pass.

1079
01:24:19,132 --> 01:24:20,648
You're going too, Don ?
I cetainly am.

1080
01:24:20,649 --> 01:24:21,958
But you got a swell job here.

1081
01:24:21,959 --> 01:24:25,860
This place is finished.
They know where those planes came from last night
and the same thing'll happen here.

1082
01:24:25,861 --> 01:24:28,822
Boom, boom. So it's California here I come.

1083
01:24:28,823 --> 01:24:31,625
And run right into the Japs.
You'd better stop off in Oklahoma City.

1084
01:24:31,626 --> 01:24:34,497
I'm going down to see about the passports.
Harry, can't we go too. I'm afraid.

1085
01:24:34,498 --> 01:24:36,387
No, wait here till I call you.

1086
01:24:36,388 --> 01:24:39,012
Mr. and Mrs. Cherry, here you are.
Thank you, Captain.

1087
01:24:39,013 --> 01:24:42,887
You're leaving, Mr. Cherry ?
Our country is coming into this business and
so there's nothing for it.

1088
01:24:42,888 --> 01:24:47,459
The honeymoon's over, eh ?
Yes, Jimmy feels he has to do his bit.

1089
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:50,083
Don't worry, darling.
The war will be over before I even get into a uniform.

1090
01:24:50,095 --> 01:24:52,410
That's what they said in 1914.

1091
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,599
Goodbye, Captain.

1092
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:00,515
Goodbye, and good luck and hapiness to both of you.

1093
01:25:00,516 --> 01:25:01,947
Thank you, Captain.

1094
01:25:01,948 --> 01:25:04,490
Come, my sweet.
See you on the bus, Mr. Van.

1095
01:25:04,491 --> 01:25:08,484
Frankly, Captain, my heart bleeds for them.

1096
01:25:08,485 --> 01:25:10,873
They come up here to spend their honeymoon on skis...

1097
01:25:10,876 --> 01:25:13,959
... and now they have to go back and fight
to make the world safe for democracy.

1098
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:15,924
Again.

1099
01:25:15,925 --> 01:25:17,268
Yes.

1100
01:25:17,269 --> 01:25:19,252
It is a tragedy.

1101
01:25:19,253 --> 01:25:24,953
Mr. Van, here are your passports.
With my compliments, you'll find them duly stamped.

1102
01:25:24,954 --> 01:25:28,584
Thank you, Captain.
How about Mr. Weber and the Madame,
are they leaving too ?

1103
01:25:28,586 --> 01:25:31,092
Oh, yes, their passports are right here.

1104
01:25:31,093 --> 01:25:35,820
If I may advise you, Mr. Van, better make ready to leave.
The train will be leaving in about 45 minutes.

1105
01:25:35,821 --> 01:25:37,246
Ok, Captain, I'll see about the trunks.

1106
01:25:41,549 --> 01:25:44,756
Is everything in order ?
Quite, Mr. Weber. Here it is.

1107
01:25:44,757 --> 01:25:47,371
Thank you. And Madame's ?
Oh, Mr. Weber...

1108
01:25:47,372 --> 01:25:53,980
... this is an unusual kind of passport.
It has given us quite some worry.

1109
01:25:53,981 --> 01:25:57,250
She was born in Russia, so she says.

1110
01:25:57,251 --> 01:26:00,761
But ever since she was a child
she has been wandering around the world
belonging to no country.

1111
01:26:00,762 --> 01:26:03,497
I secured this passport for her from the League of Nations.

1112
01:26:03,498 --> 01:26:07,276
I see. Well, since Madame is traveling with you,
I'll be glad to approve her visa.

1113
01:26:07,277 --> 01:26:09,237
But Madame is not traveling with me.

1114
01:26:10,138 --> 01:26:11,598
Well...

1115
01:26:11,599 --> 01:26:14,006
... wasn't it understood that you vouched for her ?

1116
01:26:14,007 --> 01:26:18,027
No one need vouch for Madame.
She's quite capable of taking care of herself.

1117
01:26:18,028 --> 01:26:21,887
If her passport is not in order, that's no affair of mine.
But Mr. Weber...

1118
01:26:21,888 --> 01:26:24,679
... you put me in a very embarassing position.

1119
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,434
I'll be forced to detain her.

1120
01:26:26,435 --> 01:26:30,495
You're a soldier, my dear Captain.
You should be used to being placed in embarassing positions.

1121
01:26:30,496 --> 01:26:35,261
No doubt you were in a very embarassed
when you had to shoot that confused little pacifist Quillary, huh ?

1122
01:26:35,262 --> 01:26:37,707
This is war, Captain, and...

1123
01:26:39,408 --> 01:26:41,891
Thank you, I'll look after my luggage.

1124
01:26:45,692 --> 01:26:48,954
You have my passport visa ?
Yes, Mr. Waldersee.

1125
01:26:48,955 --> 01:26:51,933
Hi, doctor. You get your rats packed ?
Yes.
There you are.

1126
01:26:51,934 --> 01:26:55,061
I can tell you, doctor.
I'm gonna be proud to have known you.

1127
01:26:55,062 --> 01:26:57,334
When I read in the papers that you've wiped out cancer...

1128
01:26:57,335 --> 01:27:00,791
... and won the Nobel Prize,
and you're the greatest hero in the world...

1129
01:27:00,792 --> 01:27:03,738
... I'll be able to say: He's a personal friend of mine.

1130
01:27:03,739 --> 01:27:06,342
He once admired my music.
Thank you very much.

1131
01:27:06,343 --> 01:27:11,927
This visa is good for crossing all borders ?
Yes, certainly, doctor.
But you're going to Zurich, aren't you ?

1132
01:27:11,928 --> 01:27:14,786
I've changed my plans. I'm going back to my home.

1133
01:27:14,787 --> 01:27:18,014
We are at war. Maybe I shall be needed.
Needed for what ?

1134
01:27:18,015 --> 01:27:20,268
I shall offer my services for what they are worth.

1135
01:27:20,269 --> 01:27:24,496
What about your rats ?
Why should I save people who don't want to be saved ?

1136
01:27:24,697 --> 01:27:27,894
So they can go out and exterminate each other ?

1137
01:27:29,095 --> 01:27:33,129
As for my rats, maybe they will be useful.

1138
01:27:33,130 --> 01:27:37,024
There will be another blockade of my country
and we will be starving.

1139
01:27:37,025 --> 01:27:40,618
Maybe I will cut my rats into filets...

1140
01:27:40,619 --> 01:27:43,119
... and eat them.

1141
01:27:43,267 --> 01:27:46,104
Now, wait a minute, doctor.
You're not thinking what you're doing.

1142
01:27:46,105 --> 01:27:49,629
I'm thinking that probably
the remedy you sold is better than mine.

1143
01:27:49,630 --> 01:27:53,712
Hasten to apply it.
We are all diseased.

1144
01:27:53,713 --> 01:27:57,979
I'm sorry to disappoint you about the Nobel Prize.

1145
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:04,284
Goodbye, Doctor.
Adieu.
Good Luck.

1146
01:28:04,446 --> 01:28:07,811
Why can't anybody answer the question everybody's asking ?

1147
01:28:07,812 --> 01:28:11,204
I know the obvious answers, but that's not good enough.

1148
01:28:11,504 --> 01:28:14,893
Weber and a million like them can't take the credit for all of this.

1149
01:28:14,894 --> 01:28:18,427
Who is it that does a dirty trick like this
to a lot of decent people ?

1150
01:28:18,547 --> 01:28:20,589
Why do you let them get away with, that's what I'd like to know.

1151
01:28:21,898 --> 01:28:25,113
My friend, we have avalanches up here.

1152
01:28:25,303 --> 01:28:26,593
They're disastrous.

1153
01:28:26,594 --> 01:28:30,735
They start with a tiny little crack in the ice,
so small you can't even see it.

1154
01:28:30,736 --> 01:28:34,606
Until suddenly it bursts wide open and then it's too late.

1155
01:28:34,607 --> 01:28:37,928
That's a very slick explanation, Captain, but it doesn't satisfy me.

1156
01:28:37,929 --> 01:28:41,306
Because this avalanche isn't made of ice,
it's made of flesh and blood, and brains.

1157
01:28:41,307 --> 01:28:43,432
Yes, I know.

1158
01:28:45,733 --> 01:28:49,099
Feel a lot better about the situation, Mr. Van ?

1159
01:28:49,338 --> 01:28:52,952
Good afternoon, my dear Captain Kirvline.
Good afternoon, madame.

1160
01:28:52,953 --> 01:28:58,203
I've had the most superb rest here.
The atmosphere here is so calm, so soothing.

1161
01:28:58,204 --> 01:29:04,124
I can't bear to think that we are going to Biarritz
with the dull, dismal old sea pounding in my ears.

1162
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:06,608
We are leaving now, Achille ?

1163
01:29:06,609 --> 01:29:10,900
I believe some difficulties have arisen.
What difficulties ?

1164
01:29:10,901 --> 01:29:12,800
Yes, Madame.

1165
01:29:13,694 --> 01:29:20,574
Madame, this passport of yours presents certain problems...
Mr. Weber will settle the problems
whatever they are, won't you, Achille ?

1166
01:29:20,575 --> 01:29:23,478
There seems to be some question about your nationality.
Yes.

1167
01:29:23,479 --> 01:29:27,255
It states here that your birthplace is uncertain, but assumed to be Armenia.

1168
01:29:27,256 --> 01:29:30,541
I have never before had the slightest difficulty about my passport.

1169
01:29:30,542 --> 01:29:32,946
It was issued by the League of Nations.

1170
01:29:34,647 --> 01:29:39,160
Madame, the fact is that circumstances
over which I have no control...

1171
01:29:39,173 --> 01:29:42,526
... compel me to deny you permission
to cross the frontier at this time.

1172
01:29:42,530 --> 01:29:47,734
I'm sure you'll appreciate the delicacy of my position.

1173
01:29:47,735 --> 01:29:50,623
Perhaps we'll be able to adjust this matter tomorrow.

1174
01:29:53,524 --> 01:29:54,922
Madame.

1175
01:30:01,623 --> 01:30:04,952
I should stay over, of course, my dear...

1176
01:30:04,953 --> 01:30:09,312
... but you know how dangerous that would be
even if I delayed my return for even so much as one day.

1177
01:30:09,523 --> 01:30:11,400
I've been in touch with our agents...

1178
01:30:11,401 --> 01:30:15,929
... and the War Ministry is demanding
that production of all munitions be doubled, trebled at once.

1179
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:18,633
Of course.

1180
01:30:18,634 --> 01:30:23,018
I'm sure this will take care of all necessary expenses.

1181
01:30:23,019 --> 01:30:26,325
And I don't think you'll be inconvenienced very long.

1182
01:30:26,326 --> 01:30:30,230
I suggest you go towards the East, Athens, possibly.
There's no danger there.

1183
01:30:32,431 --> 01:30:34,450
Thank you, Achille.

1184
01:30:34,451 --> 01:30:40,018
Thank you for having managed this so very, very tactfully.

1185
01:30:40,019 --> 01:30:43,094
You are a genuinely superior person, my dear.

1186
01:30:43,095 --> 01:30:45,205
It is a privilege to have known you.

1187
01:30:48,506 --> 01:30:50,843
Thank you again, Achille.

1188
01:30:50,844 --> 01:30:54,172
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Irena.

1189
01:31:06,773 --> 01:31:08,835
Tough luck, babe.
It's no matter.

1190
01:31:08,836 --> 01:31:11,621
I talked to the Captain.
He can't explain what went wrong.
But you can trust him.

1191
01:31:11,622 --> 01:31:15,457
He won't be as ruthless as the Bolsheviki were.
I mean, you won't suffer any bayonet boons.

1192
01:31:15,458 --> 01:31:20,388
He'll see that you get through tomorrow.
You want to be encouraging, my friend,
but that could be of no use.

1193
01:31:20,389 --> 01:31:23,082
Hey, Harry, it's time to go.
I'll be right there.

1194
01:31:23,083 --> 01:31:26,054
Go away, go away with your friends.

1195
01:31:26,055 --> 01:31:29,365
If I am to remain here, it's no concern of yours.

1196
01:31:29,366 --> 01:31:33,303
Listen, babe, I haven't any wish to...
Please don't call me babe.

1197
01:31:33,304 --> 01:31:36,939
Even if I don't believe anything you say
I can see pretty plainly that you're in a tough spot.

1198
01:31:37,194 --> 01:31:42,471
Considering our friendship back in The Royal Grand Hotel...
Must you always be in Omaha ?

1199
01:31:44,472 --> 01:31:47,754
I wanna help you Irene.
Isn't there something I can do ?

1200
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:59,297
You are very kind and very gallant,
but unfortunately you are no match for Achille Weber.

1201
01:31:59,298 --> 01:32:02,944
He has decided that I shall remain here.

1202
01:32:02,945 --> 01:32:04,897
And the decision is final.

1203
01:32:04,898 --> 01:32:07,051
Harry, come on !

1204
01:32:07,052 --> 01:32:08,874
What's he got against you ?

1205
01:32:08,875 --> 01:32:14,362
He's afraid of me.
I know too much about his methods
of promoting his own business.

1206
01:32:14,363 --> 01:32:18,046
Everybody knows about his methods.
Even Quillary was talking about them last night.

1207
01:32:18,047 --> 01:32:20,845
Yes, and what happened to Quillary ?

1208
01:32:20,846 --> 01:32:25,334
That's what happens to everyone who dares to criticize him.

1209
01:32:25,335 --> 01:32:30,120
Last night I did the one thing he could never forgive.

1210
01:32:30,121 --> 01:32:32,523
I told him the truth.

1211
01:32:32,524 --> 01:32:35,493
At last I told him just what I think.

1212
01:32:37,394 --> 01:32:40,302
And now you see how quickly he strikes back ?

1213
01:32:44,203 --> 01:32:46,609
Harry, the bus is gonna leave.

1214
01:32:46,610 --> 01:32:49,440
All right, all right.
But we gotta go this minute.

1215
01:32:49,441 --> 01:32:51,142
I'll be right there. Get out.

1216
01:32:51,144 --> 01:32:55,218
How do you like that. He stops everything
to make another pass at that Russian.

1217
01:32:55,219 --> 01:32:59,299
Go ahead. You can't help me. No one can.

1218
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,705
But...

1219
01:33:08,606 --> 01:33:15,540
... if it will make you any happier
in your future travels with Les Blondes...

1220
01:33:15,557 --> 01:33:19,922
... I will tell you, yes...

1221
01:33:20,723 --> 01:33:24,923
... I did know you slightly in Omaha.

1222
01:33:24,989 --> 01:33:27,907
So you've decided to break down and admit it at last.

1223
01:33:27,908 --> 01:33:29,472
I can't believe it.

1224
01:33:29,473 --> 01:33:31,091
Perhaps you're lying again.

1225
01:33:31,092 --> 01:33:34,027
It was room 274.

1226
01:33:34,028 --> 01:33:37,659
Does that convince you ?
How can I remember what room it was ?

1227
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:42,580
Then you will never be sure, Mr. Van.

1228
01:33:43,581 --> 01:33:46,171
Harry !
We can't wait another instant.

1229
01:33:46,172 --> 01:33:49,662
They're gonna go off without us.
We'll get stuck here.
Hurry, you're letting down the act.

1230
01:33:50,863 --> 01:33:52,754
Goodbye, Harry.

1231
01:33:55,555 --> 01:33:57,842
Goodbye again.

1232
01:34:04,743 --> 01:34:07,500
Oh, Harry, come on.
Let's go.

1233
01:34:07,628 --> 01:34:09,202
Oh, all right.

1234
01:34:20,503 --> 01:34:21,924
Goodbye.

1235
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:36,228
Why, Dumpsty.
Good afternoon, madame.

1236
01:34:36,463 --> 01:34:41,065
What is that costume ?
They called me up.

1237
01:34:41,066 --> 01:34:43,402
Look. I'm a soldier.

1238
01:34:43,403 --> 01:34:47,506
You look splendid.
If you please, madame.

1239
01:34:47,507 --> 01:34:49,816
But why didn't you go on that bus ?

1240
01:34:51,017 --> 01:34:56,825
I have decided to stay here and enjoy the winter sports.

1241
01:34:56,836 --> 01:34:58,900
This isn't a good place any more, madame.

1242
01:34:58,901 --> 01:35:00,398
They said the war is very big.

1243
01:35:00,399 --> 01:35:04,480
Bigger than the last time.
The enemy will be over here with the bombs.

1244
01:35:04,481 --> 01:35:08,332
It will be thrilling for us if they do, Dumpsty.

1245
01:35:08,333 --> 01:35:13,823
Maybe it will, madame,
but I came to say goodbye to Auguste, the barman.

1246
01:35:13,824 --> 01:35:16,256
He's a cousin of mine.

1247
01:35:16,257 --> 01:35:19,350
He will laugh when he sees me in these clothes.

1248
01:35:21,451 --> 01:35:23,373
Thank you, madame.

1249
01:35:23,374 --> 01:35:27,304
Dumpsty.
Bring bottle of champagne and two glasses.

1250
01:35:27,305 --> 01:35:30,496
We'll have drink together.
If you please, madame.

1251
01:35:34,397 --> 01:35:37,922
Your luggage is in the hall, madame.
Will you wish it taken to the same suite ?

1252
01:35:38,623 --> 01:35:42,510
No, thank you.
Have you anything smaller ?

1253
01:35:42,511 --> 01:35:44,120
Smaller ?
Yes.

1254
01:35:44,121 --> 01:35:47,754
We have smaller rooms on the other side of the hotel.

1255
01:35:47,755 --> 01:35:50,479
I will have the smallest. It will be cosier.

1256
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:51,915
Wish to go to it now ?

1257
01:35:51,916 --> 01:35:55,209
No, thank you. You can send up the luggage,
I will look at it later.

1258
01:35:55,210 --> 01:35:56,587
Very well.

1259
01:36:00,088 --> 01:36:04,936
I was right, madame.
August laughed very much.

1260
01:36:08,837 --> 01:36:14,192
You'll enjoy being a soldier, Dumpsty.
Oh yes, madame. If I'm taken prisoner soon enough.

1261
01:36:18,793 --> 01:36:22,991
Go ahead and pour yourself one.
Thank you so much, madame.

1262
01:36:22,992 --> 01:36:25,968
I wasn't sure I heard you correctly.

1263
01:36:25,969 --> 01:36:28,494
Here's to you, Dumpsty.

1264
01:36:28,536 --> 01:36:33,225
And to you, madame, if you please.
Thank you.

1265
01:36:38,226 --> 01:36:43,018
Who do you think will win this war, Dumpsty ?
I know nothing of that, madame.

1266
01:36:43,019 --> 01:36:47,927
I expect it will be like the last time.
Whoever wins, my country will lose.

1267
01:36:47,928 --> 01:36:51,182
They will all lose, Dumpsty.

1268
01:36:51,183 --> 01:36:53,032
If you please, madame.

1269
01:36:53,533 --> 01:36:57,585
Now I must go, if you will excuse me.

1270
01:36:58,455 --> 01:36:59,721
Dumpsty...

1271
01:37:02,222 --> 01:37:03,880
Here's for you.

1272
01:37:03,881 --> 01:37:10,918
Goodbye, and God bless you.
Thank you so much, madame.

1273
01:38:31,399 --> 01:38:34,306
Did you have some trouble ?
No.

1274
01:38:34,307 --> 01:38:37,650
Whose is that champagne ?
Mine, won't you have some ?

1275
01:38:37,651 --> 01:38:39,221
Thanks.

1276
01:38:39,222 --> 01:38:41,612
Dumpsty used that glass.
That's all right.

1277
01:38:41,784 --> 01:38:44,331
What happened ?

1278
01:38:44,332 --> 01:38:47,555
Didn't you get across the border ?
The girls did.

1279
01:38:47,556 --> 01:38:51,949
There was a train waiting on the other side.
Mr. and Mrs. Cherry promised to look out for them.
They'll be okay.

1280
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:57,287
And you came back to me.

1281
01:38:57,288 --> 01:39:00,150
It seems fairly obvious that I did come back.

1282
01:39:00,151 --> 01:39:05,319
You meant it when you said you wanted to help me.
You said I'd never be sure.

1283
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:07,952
Well, I came back to tell you that I am sure.

1284
01:39:07,953 --> 01:39:12,160
I got to thinking it over in the bus
and I came to the conclusion that it was room 274.

1285
01:39:12,161 --> 01:39:14,122
Or close to it anyway.

1286
01:39:14,123 --> 01:39:19,660
Somehow or other, I couldn't help feeling touched to think
of all the sordid hotels you've been in
you should have remembered that one.

1287
01:39:19,661 --> 01:39:22,924
The age of chivalry still lives.

1288
01:39:22,925 --> 01:39:26,893
What ?
I said romance is not dead.

1289
01:39:26,894 --> 01:39:33,621
Somewhere in that funny music hall soul of yours
is the spirit of a knight in shining armour.

1290
01:39:33,622 --> 01:39:39,476
You give up everything, risk your life,
walk unafraid into the valley of the shadows...

1291
01:39:39,477 --> 01:39:44,477
... to aid and comfort a damsel in distress. Isn't that the truth ?

1292
01:39:44,478 --> 01:39:47,683
Yes, that's the truth. Plainly and simply put.

1293
01:39:47,684 --> 01:39:50,666
Give me some more champagne.

1294
01:39:55,667 --> 01:39:57,727
Another bottle of champagne.
Hi, Captain.

1295
01:39:57,728 --> 01:40:00,860
Mr. Van. What's happened ?
Was there some mistake at the frontier ?

1296
01:40:00,861 --> 01:40:04,953
No, no mistake.
It's just that I'm an incurable sap, I guess.

1297
01:40:04,954 --> 01:40:06,542
I'll be seeing you, Captain.

1298
01:40:10,643 --> 01:40:13,250
Look, Harry.

1299
01:40:13,251 --> 01:40:17,320
The souvenir of Omaha.

1300
01:40:20,721 --> 01:40:23,274
I told you then that I wasn't everybody.

1301
01:40:23,275 --> 01:40:25,306
And it's true. I'm nobody.

1302
01:40:25,307 --> 01:40:28,797
But I learned that it's no use telling the truth
to people whose whole life is a lie.

1303
01:40:28,798 --> 01:40:33,474
So I thought if I told lies big enough, I'd make myself big.

1304
01:40:33,641 --> 01:40:36,651
But I can't lie to you, Harry.
You're different from all the rest.

1305
01:40:46,552 --> 01:40:51,201
All these years you've been surrounded by blondes
and you've loved only me.

1306
01:40:51,202 --> 01:40:55,781
Quit pawing me, will you ?
If you're hooking up with me
it's for professional reasons only, see ?

1307
01:40:55,782 --> 01:40:59,123
Yes, I see.
And what's more, I'm the manager.

1308
01:40:59,124 --> 01:41:01,398
I'll fix it with the Captain
so we can get across the border tomorrow.

1309
01:41:01,399 --> 01:41:03,983
Or the next day, or soon.
We'll join up with the girls in Geneva.

1310
01:41:03,984 --> 01:41:06,362
And while we're working there,
you and I will rehearse the code.

1311
01:41:06,363 --> 01:41:07,887
The code ?

1312
01:41:07,888 --> 01:41:09,815
Of course, the code.

1313
01:41:09,816 --> 01:41:11,800
I'll learn it easily.

1314
01:41:11,801 --> 01:41:14,716
I shall be the greatest mind reader in the world.

1315
01:41:14,717 --> 01:41:17,644
If you're gonna qualify for this act with me you gotta lay off the liquor.

1316
01:41:17,645 --> 01:41:19,631
I mean, after this is gone.

1317
01:41:19,632 --> 01:41:22,142
It's a well known fact that booze and science don't mix.

1318
01:41:22,143 --> 01:41:25,256
I don't think I shall use my own name. No.

1319
01:41:25,257 --> 01:41:28,531
Americans would mispronounce it horribly.

1320
01:41:28,532 --> 01:41:34,843
I shall call myself Namura.
Namura, the Great.

1321
01:41:34,844 --> 01:41:36,569
Assisted by Harry Van.

1322
01:41:39,370 --> 01:41:42,738
I shall wear a black velvet dress, very plain.

1323
01:41:42,739 --> 01:41:45,274
My skin, of course, ivory white.

1324
01:41:45,275 --> 01:41:47,449
I must have something to hold.

1325
01:41:47,450 --> 01:41:49,265
One white flower.

1326
01:41:50,367 --> 01:41:52,668
No, a little white prayer book.

1327
01:41:52,672 --> 01:41:55,810
That's it. A little white...

1328
01:41:56,311 --> 01:41:58,159
What's that ?

1329
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:05,350
What is it, Captain ?

1330
01:42:05,351 --> 01:42:09,238
Enemy airplanes. Reprisal for last night.
They have come to destroy our base here.

1331
01:42:09,256 --> 01:42:13,759
I see.
They have no reason to attack this hotel,
but accidents might easily happen. I advise the cellar.

1332
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,788
Please, madame. Please, do come.
In a moment, Captain.

1333
01:42:17,789 --> 01:42:22,159
I entreat you, madame, not to be reckless.
I have enough on my conscience right now
without having to add to it your innocent life.

1334
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:26,255
Don't worry, Captain. Death and I are old friends.
God be with you, Madame.

1335
01:42:28,556 --> 01:42:31,012
They are bombing us.
Everyone is going to the cellar.

1336
01:42:31,013 --> 01:42:32,301
Thanks, pal.

1337
01:42:32,302 --> 01:42:34,701
I wouldn't like to die in a cellar, would you, Harry ?

1338
01:42:34,702 --> 01:42:36,661
No, but that's where we're going. Come on.

1339
01:42:36,662 --> 01:42:38,172
I love you, Harry.

1340
01:42:40,273 --> 01:42:42,129
And you adore me, don't you, darling ?

1341
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:45,320
Did I ever say so ?
No, of course not. You'd never admit it.

1342
01:42:57,421 --> 01:43:01,737
We won't have to die in the cellar after all, Harry.
Nor in any other place if I can help it.

1343
01:43:07,538 --> 01:43:11,922
Harry !
Do you realize the whole world has gone to war ?

1344
01:43:11,923 --> 01:43:13,439
The whole world.

1345
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:16,168
I realize it, but don't ask me why.
I've stopped trying to figure it out.

1346
01:43:16,169 --> 01:43:17,571
I know why it is.

1347
01:43:17,572 --> 01:43:21,868
The intention to kill us, you and me, is because we are the little people.

1348
01:43:21,869 --> 01:43:25,548
And for us, the deadliest weapons are the most merciful.
Irene.

1349
01:43:25,549 --> 01:43:30,466
I never cared before, Harry, but now I want to live.
So do I, but if we don't, let's hope we make a fast exit.

1350
01:43:30,467 --> 01:43:32,487
And together.

1351
01:43:37,488 --> 01:43:40,247
Nice try, buddy, but you missed it.

1352
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:43,897
Harry.

1353
01:43:45,698 --> 01:43:47,518
Do you know any hymns ?

1354
01:43:47,519 --> 01:43:49,074
What ?

1355
01:43:49,075 --> 01:43:51,042
Do you know any hymns ?

1356
01:43:52,343 --> 01:43:54,687
Sure. Sure I do.

1357
01:44:01,388 --> 01:44:03,804
Which one ?
Any one.

1358
01:44:03,805 --> 01:44:06,424
Something you used to sing when you were a little boy.

1359
01:44:11,025 --> 01:44:18,745
"Abide with me; fast falls the eventide"

1360
01:44:18,746 --> 01:44:27,776
"The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide"

1361
01:44:27,777 --> 01:44:36,735
"When other helpers fail and comforts flee"

1362
01:44:36,736 --> 01:44:42,732
"Help of the helpless..."
I loved you all the time, Irene.

1363
01:44:42,833 --> 01:44:44,912
Thanks for telling me, darling.

1364
01:44:46,413 --> 01:44:55,148
I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless

1365
01:44:55,149 --> 01:45:03,670
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness

1366
01:45:03,671 --> 01:45:12,949
Where is deaths sting? Where, grave, thy victory?

1367
01:45:12,950 --> 01:45:24,981
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.

1368
01:45:29,071 --> 01:45:30,760
Look, Harry !

1369
01:45:30,761 --> 01:45:32,722
They've gone away.
