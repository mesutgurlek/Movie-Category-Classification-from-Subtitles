All characters & incidents
in this film are fictitious.

2
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,551
lt's all stabbings & killings
one hears about Tirunelveli.

3
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,057
They are always carrying a sickle
saying to cut grass or thorns.

4
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,228
lf they get angry,
they hack down people.

5
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,897
You said you're going to a marriage.
But you're not wearing any jewels.

6
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:19,894
lf l wear jewellery ,

7
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,397
l don't know if l can reach
the destination safely.

8
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,528
Lorries are banned to ply on this road.
But, who follows rules here?

9
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,739
Yesterday also 2 people
were stabbed here.

10
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,404
Generally people come to
temple after bath.

11
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:30,572
But these people come drunk
to the temple.

12
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,244
lf there's a wine shop
opposite the temple.

13
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:33,241
They will come drunk to the temple.

14
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,414
Lord Nellaipparsamy must
find a way out for us.

15
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,265
One beer!

16
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,933
Still you've not fully recovered from
last night's drinking binge.

17
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,328
Still, you want beer.

18
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,225
A beer so early in the morning!
Who are you man?

19
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,459
Saamy!

20
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,133
They've strewn leaves on the path.

21
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,470
4 ''idlies''. l don't want
chutney & ''sambar''.

22
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,572
Do you want to choke yourself
to death eating just ''idlies''?

23
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:43,978
Watch!

24
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,486
He has turned ''idlies'' into a paste.

25
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:50,587
He has turned beer
into buttermilk.

26
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:58,324
l've seen many varieties of ''idlies''!

27
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,492
But for the first time
l'm seeing a beer ''idly''.

28
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,158
You look new to the place.
Who are you? - Saamy.

29
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,998
Hail Saamy! who eats ''idly'' with beer.

30
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,838
Hailing me!

31
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,841
Selling oil to an Arab!
Selling ice to an Eskimo.

32
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,347
Hey! lsn't he having hiccups!
Give him water.

33
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,474
Water! Who'll drink?

34
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:25,757
Lord Arumugasaamy has a spear
as weapon.

35
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:34,295
Lord Ayyanarsaamy has trident as a
weapon in his hands.

36
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:42,873
Lord Ganesha's place
is Pillaiyarpatti.

37
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:51,646
For a man singing & dancing on road.
With a full bottle of beer.

38
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,048
What's this Saamy?
Your song has lulled down.

39
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,721
Saamy needs a kick!
- What do you want us to do?

40
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,551
Beat the drums!
- Hey! beat the drums boy!

41
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,563
Buddy, sing a lively song.

42
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:15,571
lt's Tirunelveli ''halwa''!
lt's Trichy's Rockfort.

43
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:16,901
What?

44
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,917
l'm the Saamy who gave ''laddu''
to Tirupathi Saamy (God).

45
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:28,412
''Halwa'' of this Theft shop,
Old woman of ''ldli'' shop.

46
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,749
lf you hear the noise of batons...
lt's Saamy!

47
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,253
Lord Nellaiapparsaamy will
secure us like a fence.

48
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:38,760
l'll be a fence,
if you come to me.

49
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:42,025
Lord Kanthimathi saamy will
fulfill your wishes.

50
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:45,600
l'll come to you & fulfill
your wishes.

51
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:49,271
A train is whistling beside the
Palayamkottai jail.

52
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,319
Never make fun of any one
calling him egg.

53
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:40,754
lf you keep an egg on an egg
lt'll become 8.

54
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,358
Don't insult anyone calling
him a drunkard.

55
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,832
l'm a man who can withstand
500ml of local stuff also.

Shaven head of Palani.

l'm a bull gifted to the temple.

59
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:04,672
lf l get angry entire
gang will vanish.

60
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,877
Betel leaves of Kumbakonam,
aren't enough for me.

61
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:11,683
She's grinding like the
local sugar mill.

62
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:54,059
Our fragrance will be pleasing.
Did a beauty come?

63
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:07,910
l had seen MGR's films sitting on
sand at a touring talkies.

64
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:14,747

65
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:18,253

What's there in Chennai?
Not a drop of water.

69
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,929
Test the waters before entering into it.

70
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:35,437
Tell me if there's any one
to challenge me.

71
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,769
You'll get a kick, if you

What l'm saying is right.

73
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:28,784
<i>TAMlLlNl</i>

74
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,322
Hey! Why are you creating
trouble here?

75
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,499
He has beaten me!

76
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,431
Hey!...How dare you touch me?

77
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:46,175
lf a man gets drunk & creates
trouble in my station limits,

78
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,505
Won't l hold him by his neck?

79
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,237
l'll beat you.

80
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,248
You're under arrest!
- Do you've a warrant?

81
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:56,844
Will this Punctuality Paramasivam
come without a warrant?

82
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,024
Take it man! Read it.

83
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:05,194
Sir, please come to station with me.
Your's `Punctuality Paramasivam'.

84
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:10,864
What's this? - Under arrest.

85
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,264
`Upper' arrest is enough for you.

86
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:14,865
Throwing bottles!

87
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,541
Did you see how perfectly
l found out?

88
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:17,606
Statesmanship!

89
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,810
One must have intelligence first.

90
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,876
Don't think l'm not
brave enough.

91
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,878
ln a jiffy, l can break open
the gate & beat you.

92
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,550
Why do you want to break?
lt's already open.

93
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,219
Hey! Catch it...Catch it...
Couldn't you tell me it isn't locked?

94
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,884
Hey! Wait...he's having
the bail order.

95
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,560
lt's against law, if we keep a man
in jail with a bail.

96
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,059
Will you give me the bail and
come out of the jail?

97
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,725
lf you write on a white paper,
it's warrant.

98
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,730
lf Gandhi smiles on a green note,
is it a bail order?

99
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,570
You're maintaining
law & order perfectly. - Sir bail!

100
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,403
Sir, how can you release
after filing F.l.R?

101
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,576
Put this man into the jail
instead of him.

102
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,574
We can change people
but can we change names?

103
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,076
What's this man's name?
- Kuppusaamy.

104
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,578
That man's name?
- Saamy.

105
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:57,578
Add `Kuppu' before Saamy's name.

106
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:58,977
And put this `Kuppa' (trash)
into the jail.

107
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:00,949
How did you manage it?

108
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,554
You were arrested yesterday
but out today.

109
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:03,584
lt's the power of money.

110
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,916
Where can l get this `matter'?
- You mean `Marijuana'?

111
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,922
lf you go to ''Rettai Marathadi''
and ask for 'sugar cane refuse'.

112
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:08,593
You'll get it.

113
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,591
'Sugar cane refuse'?
- That's the other name of Marijuana.

114
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,757
Do you get girls here?

115
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:17,762
Girls! MLA is running it as a wholesale
trade in Melapalayam.

116
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,598
Ward & district level leaders are
doing it in retail in lodges.

117
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,934
Not only that spurious liquor is
brewed behind the market.

118
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,778
There are hired henchmen
in Palayamkottai.

119
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,776
There are hired killers
in our area.

120
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,673
Rowdies are spreading out to
4 states from our place only.

121
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,449
Annachi Perumal Pitchai is the
king pin of this illegal trade.

122
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,618
Why are you asking me
all the details?

123
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,958
l never asked, you told me
everything yourself.

124
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,354
Oh! ls this known as making
others sing?

125
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,634
Hey! What's going on man?
Leave him...

126
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,807
Hey what did he do?
- Sir, he stole my briefcase.

127
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,479
How dare you steal a briefcase
in the middle of a busy town?

128
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,236
Give it to me.

129
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,808
Constable, put him into the jeep.

130
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:05,809
Whose briefcase is this?

131
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,315
Sir, it's mine, there are
Rs.3 lakhs cash in it.

132
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,650
Let it be there! Come to the station,
sign the papers and take it.

133
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,154
Hey! Why are you gathering
around here? Go away.

134
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,002
Sir greetings!
- Who's stopping the police jeep?

135
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,835
lf police like you resort to stealing,
what do we thieves do then?

136
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,173
Give me way.

137
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,347
Brother, you can't go from here
without answering me.

138
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,015
Hey! Run over the jeep on him.

139
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,380
He said he's Saamy (God) but he's
beating like a devil.

140
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:22,843
Give it man.

141
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,013
Hey, stop it man!

142
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:30,519
How dare a rowdy like you
beat a policeman?

143
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,453
Am l a vandal and you a policeman?

144
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,695
You're not a D.D. Dandapani
but KD(vandal) Dandapani.

145
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,527
Looks like you'll give your uniform
to make him a policeman.

146
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,530
He's a wastrel, you're supporting him.
Arrest him.

147
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,703
l know whom l should arrest.
Who are you?

148
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:50,534
One, two, three, four, five...

149
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,003
l'm Aru(Six) Saamy.

150
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:57,215
Deputy Commissioner of Police,
Tirunelveli city.

151
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,881
Bloody rascal, you were stealing
spare parts in lorry sheds.

152
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,716
And you're robbing people here?

153
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,153
Arrest him.

154
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,132
Did you salute me
or your big bellies?

155
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,971
Once more... - Yes sir.

156
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,579
He's taking us to task for salute.
Don't know what's in store.

157
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,245
Who hoisted this flag?
- l did sir.

158
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,576
You've hoisted it 3 inches lower!

159
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,753
l couldn't see 3 inch difference
at the height of 30 feet.

160
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,750
Then, you wouldn't be able to see a
thief 30 feet away from you.

161
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:37,922
One week's suspension!

162
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,588
Oh God! Then l think
l'll be dismissed.

163
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,590
Do you know march past?
- They've forgotten all that.

164
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:43,591
Poor guys!

165
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,923
They've become like statutes
standing in one place for 20 years.

166
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,928
But l'm not like them sir
if you say l'll achieve it.

167
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,930
lf you say milk l'll become butter
if you say pulse l'll become sambar.

168
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,102
lf l say fire, will you
immolate yourself?

169
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,429
Will you kill if l
pay you money?

170
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,936
Will you throw out Kuppa (trash) and
add `Kuppa' to Saamy's name.

171
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:57,605
First zip up your pant.
- Yes sir.

172
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,108
Look here! l'm telling
everyone.

173
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,946
Go and get drunk any where.

174
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,774
Wear shoes or not?
Cut hair or not?

175
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,609
Wear uniform or not?
Wear your cap or not?

176
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,115
l'm not bothered about all these.

177
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:11,115
You must follow the orders strictly,
if anyone bungles or refuses.

178
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,117
No warnings, suspensions or dismissals.

179
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,790
l'll kill you overnight and throw
your bodies into river Thamaraparani.

180
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:16,619
Mind it!

181
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,956
100 Criminals might escape,
forget about them.

182
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,791
But an innocent should
never be punished.

183
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,631
A policeman must be proud.

184
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,800
lf anyone disturbs peace in public places.
Bash him up right there.

185
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:30,141
We must be a friend to people
and a rogue to rogues.

186
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,641
We policemen should salute
only our National flag.

187
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,810
lt's a town with a radius
of just 5 kms.

188
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,311
Though so many policemen are here, still
crimes are being committed regularly.

189
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:38,642
Who's responsible for it?

190
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,143
Mr.Paramasivam! - Yes sir.

191
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,649
Buses, lorries plying in Tirunelveli,

192
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:42,980
Wine shops, jewellery shops,
provision shops,

193
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,816
Lodges, hotels, colleges
businessmen, students,

194
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,317
Government servants, lawyers, doctors,

195
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,824
l want the entire list of people in
this town within 24 hours.

196
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:50,653
Why do you want doctors list?

197
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,660
l must know the number
of fake doctors.

198
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,599
Unwanted lorries shouldn't
enter the town.

199
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,665
Buses shouldn't stop at
unnecessary places.

200
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,162
No one should be in a petty shop
for more than 10 minutes.

201
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,168
A group of 4 people shouldn't
walk on the roads.

202
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,008
Most important, no one must tie their
lungies above their thighs.

203
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,608
lf they refuse,
kick their butts.

204
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,176
Sir, this is like MlSA rule.

205
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:08,171
What is my name?

206
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,507
Read it from the end `SA' `Ml'! MlSA.

207
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,515
l'm not a policeman but a rogue.

208
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,382
Rascal!

209
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,923
Unload it slowly,
don't hurt yourself.

210
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,882
l'll supply mustard, pepper, cumin and
fenugreek in 50 & 100 gms pack.

211
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:58,893
l'll supply sugar in 1 kg pack.
Take delivery tomorrow.

212
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,843
Sir, Rs.4,500, last week's bill.

213
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,071
Give it to my grand daughter as usual.

214
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,247
Come here for a moment.

215
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,915
Grandpa, did you call me?
- Yes.

216
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,420
Take that money and keep it safely.

217
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,089
Sugar bag appears very weak.
ls it not feeling well?

218
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,094
What's the weight of this bag?
- 100 kgs.

219
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,926
You bought it after
weighing it, didn't you?

220
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,261
No, l must weigh it now.
- Weigh it & show me.

221
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,937
Hey! Put the bag on weighing scale.

222
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,538
lt's 94 kgs. only!
What happened to 6 kgs?

223
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,610
ls it for this bag only or
is it a feature to all your bags?

224
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,778
lf your proprietor comes to know,
you'll lose your job.

225
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:58,285
We get 40 paise per packet
as commission.

226
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,219
We are doing it to supplement
our meager earnings.

227
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,290
You are making us lose money.
- Forgive me sir.

228
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:03,119
l'll take leave mother

229
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,122
Hereafter this mistake
will not be repeated.

230
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,960
Your son is labour officer
for name's sake only.

231
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:14,465
lf he takes bribe from shop owners
he'll easily make money.

232
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:19,133
He's talking like a mad man
about honesty, sincerity.

233
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:22,802
That's why we are struggling
to meet both ends meet.

234
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,642
Grandpa, don't criticize dad.

235
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,485
Desiring other's money is a sin.

236
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,320
Money earned by hard work
only, will be with us.

237
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,720
Mother, l've taken
Rs.100 for bus pass.

238
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,787
Grandma, l'll go to college.
- Okay dear.

239
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:34,822
Sister, l'll go.

240
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,995
Meenakshi, your husband
is not to be seen all day?

241
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:42,062
Yes, is your son-in-law behaving
like a brahmin?

242
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:43,996
He went to conduct a sacrifice.

243
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,329
Don't know where he might be
picking up trouble now?

244
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,508
Stop, park your vehicle aside.
- Have you started it?

245
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:55,680
l'm on my way to conduct
a ceremony.

246
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,178
Let's take care of things
while coming back.

247
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,612
Forget it, park it aside and
take out your documents.

248
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,513
Documents mean?
- lnsurance.

249
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,685
For me, you or my bike?
- Of the bike?

250
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,118
Then, take it.

251
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,860
R.C.book! - Take R.C book.

252
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,689
Road tax! - There's no road but
you're asking for road tax.

253
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,523
What's this you're riding the bike without
changing the number plate?

254
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:18,031
Take it.

255
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,362
Why are you showing
like channel V?

256
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,539
You're changing rules at
the drop of a hat.

257
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,369
So, l've a white, black and
yellow number plate.

258
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:29,445
When you decide,
l'll fix that number plate.

259
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,878
You can fix it later, take out
your license. - License?

260
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,814
Take it...Check it.

261
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:39,052
You're without the tuft
in this photo.

262
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,051
That photo was taken
when l was a student.

263
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,385
So, l didn't have a tuft then.

264
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:46,155
lt is passport size photo,
infact l had gone there without pant.

265
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,559
Do you need all that?

266
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,394
How to make him pay fine?
Can you do an 8?

267
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,328
Not that, on your bike
can you do it?

268
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,904
Would they grant me a license
without doing that?

269
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:59,243
Then, make a 7 on your bike
- 7?

270
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,743
l think he's expecting some
bribe from me.

271
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,583
Come & sit on my bike
l'll do a 7.5.

272
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:10,187
How can you do that?
- Sit man, l'll show you.

273
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,587
l'm sitting. - Your bad time
starts now, pray to god.

274
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:21,262
Go slowly! - This is second installment
it has just started.

275
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:25,766
Are you killing me in installments!
- This is 3rd round.

276
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:30,504
Watch out, l'm doing a 7.5 on bike.
lsn't it fine? - Leave me, priest.

277
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:34,440
l'll show you how to repent.

278
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:42,119
Mr. Priest.

279
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:46,450
l asked your number plate and you
made me a nameless policeman.

280
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,285
That is real bad time.

281
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,624
Hey! Where's my left hand?

282
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,128
lt fell near Rettaipalam bridge.
Didn't you pick it up?

283
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:57,301
You're are referring to it as a cheap pencil?
- l'll get it for you.

284
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,318
Why does he never pray to
god at the temple?

285
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,322
Why are you looking at
me like this?

286
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:30,930
An astrologer told me to visit the temple
on Fridays or else l'll die.

287
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,661
Otherwise why would l come
to visit this man?

288
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:37,504
Saamy, l'll not spare you without
packing you to Singapore.

289
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:41,509
Book a ticket to God's idol from
Tuticorin port to Singapore.

290
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:42,179
As you say.

291
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:53,020
He's a millionaire!

292
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,783
But, his name is
Perumal Pitchai(Beggar).

293
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,029
lt seems God had collected
food in alms.

294
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,198
And Hanuman snatched it from his
hands & enjoyed eating it.

295
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:04,027
But here, l'll snatch & l'll eat.

296
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:10,533
40 years ago, l was begging
in this temple.

297
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:15,310
So, l had changed my name from
llaya Perumal to Perumal Pitchai (Beggar).

298
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,038
Enough!

299
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:18,875
Greetings sir.

300
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,882
He's garlanding a rogue
instead of god.

301
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:26,415
Why did you garland me?
Are you changing party? - No Annachi.

302
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:30,216
A by-election is scheduled for
SriVaikuntam. Brother needs your support.

303
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:32,491
l've already made you two as MLA's.

304
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,391
Do you want one more?

305
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:36,999
There's only one bridge
in SriVaikuntam.

306
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,829
Only one bus can go on it, at a time.

307
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,403
Are you planning to bring it down?
- Nothing like that sir.

308
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:42,903
Okay, you want to contest
the election.

309
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:46,236
Subramani, are you doing well?
- l'm fine.

310
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,239
He stole a woman's jewels when she
bent to give him alms.

311
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:50,243
Today, he's a big shot.

312
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,014
l know him very well.

313
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,852
Even if l give him Rs. 10 lakhs.

314
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:59,251
He'll make a golden begging bowl
and beg in Singapore.

315
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:04,926
Sir, we've got information that
Coimbatore MP is going to Guruvayoor.

316
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:11,595
A man who was hiding without
even going to Parliament.

317
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,934
lf he's daring to come out, it means...

318
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,442
Kill him! - Annachi, situation
is very bad.

319
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:23,444
Are we killing for money, to be returned,
if we fail in our mission.

320
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,113
Political murders must be committed
at regular intervals.

321
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:30,112
lll fated guy! Bloody man is
going to a temple to die.

322
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,665
Sir, you'll never get married?
- Why?

323
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:41,962
You're searching
so many houses to live.

324
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,634
How many girls would
you see to marry one?

325
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:44,798
Don't worry if we
fail to get one.

326
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:45,970
We've police quarters
as the last resort.

327
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,799
This's the house mentioned
by the shop keeper.

328
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:55,271
Whom do you want?

329
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,807
We've come to see a house for rent.
- Who are you?

330
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,246
l'm an lnspector and he's
Deputy Commissioner.

331
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:07,491
Just wait there.

332
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:13,028
Grandma, last week two people stole in the
disguise of policemen, they're here.

333
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:14,788
Yes, did you close
the door properly?

334
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,830
Grandma, we must plan
and catch them.

335
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,832
Why do you want to take
unnecessary risk?

336
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,334
Aunt, be ready with
chili powder.

337
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,166
You all come immediately,
when l call you, come grandma.

338
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,178
We'll come late at nights,
there's only one way here.

339
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,506
What can we do if they lock it?
- We must break the lock.

340
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,011
Don't we know it?
- Didn't l tell you?

341
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,352
Come...come...please.

342
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,521
This is the hall,
a very large one.

343
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:42,125
You can place the sofa,
Sit or do anything.

344
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,528
Why is she speaking
like a loose (mad)?

345
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:47,197
Yes, loose...the door latch
is little loose.

346
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,525
lt'll be okay if we tighten it.

347
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:53,026
Grandma is old, but really bold.
- They say old is gold.

348
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,202
They said upstairs is vacant.
But, you're showing the downstairs.

349
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:58,035
Our first floor and ground
floors are alike. - Yes.

350
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:01,303
lf you see one you
needn't see another.

351
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,947
This is middle of the house,
that is the store room.

352
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,548
You can stock groceries.

353
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,877
This is prayer room
to pray to god.

354
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,383
ls the entire family mad?
- That's kitchen.

355
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:13,148
You can cook, fry, eat or do anything.
- Clever girl.

356
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,883
That is bedroom!
- You can sleep, take rest.

357
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,226
You said it right, go inside
and see. - No need.

358
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,899
Go inside!
- Hey why are you pushing us inside?

359
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,401
Aunt...Aunt! All of you come here.
We've caught the thieves.

360
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,834
Thieves! Tell them, who are we?

361
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,738
How many people we would've arrested?

362
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:32,409
Today 2 mad women
have arrested us.

363
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:35,507
Wait, did you call the police? - Yes.

364
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,082
Aunt, we are real police.

365
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,750
Last week 2 guys
said the same thing.

366
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,748
Aunt, please listen to me.

367
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:45,915
What happened?

368
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,926
Sir, they threw chili
powder on my face.

369
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:50,423
Why are you laughing sir?

370
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,926
What happened madam?

371
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,599
Open the door carefully, 2 strong
bull like men are there. - Yes.

372
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:56,934
Aim your rifles at them.

373
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,762
Sir, will your gun fire?

374
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,431
Look at the way they're
coming out, beat them.

375
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:04,767
Sir, what's this?
- Did you call him a thief?

376
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,603
He's our Deputy Commissioner.

377
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,109
Deputy Commissioner?

378
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:13,375
A mistake has been
committed unknowingly.

379
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:14,110
Please forgive us...

380
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,288
Last week, a similar incident
happened in the next street.

381
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:18,956
That's why my grand daughter
mistook you.

382
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,659
Sorry! - Forgive us.

383
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:28,297
That is the way out.

384
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,125
Give me some ''idlies''...
l'll have them with this side dish.

385
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:40,807
Greetings sir...

386
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:41,671
Greetings sir...

387
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,814
lf we leave it as it is, it'll
become a problem. - Okay...okay..

388
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:45,312
New Deputy Commissioner
has come to see you.

389
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,150
Welcome, Deputy Commissioner...

390

Name...Arusaamy!
Place...Palani.

391
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,653
Till now, you've been transferred to
7 places and this is your 8th place.

392
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,757
You never stayed at any place
for a long time...

393
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,828
You're such an honest man.

394
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:05,833
My boys told me this place has changed
a little after your arrival.

395
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,766
What are you looking at man?
l'm here ...

396
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,169
But l'm aware of all that's happening
in every nook & corner of lndia.

397
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:17,439
But nobody knows about me...
- l know...

398
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:21,085
Your original name is llaya Perumal,
63 years old, native place, Vallanadu.

399
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:24,513
Out of 123 wine shops in Tirunelveli,

400
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:27,247
You own 1 16 shops including
36 illegal shops.

401
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,123
Out of 80 lorries quarrying
sand from river Tamarabarani,

402
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,419
You own 75 lorries.

403
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,691
30 of them are running illegally.

404
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,599
18 omni buses plying to out stations
are without permits.

405
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,594
You own many lodges
under fictitious names.

406
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,528
They're being used for
illegal activities.

407
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:44,104
You've 3 ships in Tuticorin & 2 cracker
factories in Sivakasi. Apart from these,

408
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,004
Which ever party may come to power...

409
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:47,975
ln the 8 districts of south,

410
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:51,113
You select the winning &
losing MLA's & MP's.

411
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,279
Perumal Pitchai, kingmaker.

412
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,786
But your name will never be published
in the newspaper...

413
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,219
Your posters will never be seen.

414
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:04,122
After knowing all this, you won't
leave me without taking action.

415
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,796
But, if you take action
l won't spare you.

416
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,624
You won't take bribe also.

417
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,298
Which place you want to
be transferred? Tell me.

418
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:14,035
l'll help you...
- Who said that l won't take bribes?

419
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:15,971
My henchmen.

420
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:18,142
Hey! Give him a chair.
Go & bring it.

421
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:20,640
How much can you offer?

422
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:22,139
How much you want?

423
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,976
l want to do my duty.
l need your help for that.

424
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:26,980
l didn't get you.

425
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:28,812
ln city, your lorries
always cross speed limit,

426
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,317
and are frequently involved
in accidents.

427
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,988
They should be
within city speed limits.

428
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:34,483
Despite knowing, drinking liquor is
injurious to health, they drink.

429
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,319
l'm not bothered about them.

430
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:39,595
But if a drunkard creates a scene
on the road, l'll not spare him.

431
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,596
Your henchmen shouldn't come to me
for taking them out on bail.

432
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,168
l'm not bothered about your
illegal businesses.

433
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:47,230
But you should control local goons
who use your name.

434
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,665
Or else, l may have to control them
and you shouldn't get angry with me.

435
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,502
l don't care about your
illegal wine shops.

436
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:56,775
But, you've 7 shops near schools & temples
which are troublesome to people.

437
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,448
l'm not asking you to
close down those shops.

438
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,075
You can shift them to
some other place.

439
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:06,849
lf you agree to this,
l'll accept your money.

440
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:12,359
l think what you said is right.

441
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:15,032
Okay, l'll make arrangements.

442
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,701
Hey! Give him...take it...

443
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:24,366
l'll take leave...

444
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:26,543
Brother...

445
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:31,038
You said you're from Palani...
What is the caste you said...

446
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,041
l didn't say.

447
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:39,385
Sir, what's this?
Why did you act like a`Yes man'?

448
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:44,050
He seems to be from our caste.
- What do you mean?

449
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,630
Did you hear his brave words?

450
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:48,558
So, do we've to obey
all his commands?

451
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:52,133
He was not ordering us.
He told us politely.

452
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:54,903
His predecessors went against us.

453
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,074
Or else, they took bribe and
ruined the town.

454
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,902
He's different to them.

455
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,739
Not only that we are also facing
problems in those 7 shops.

456
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,240
let's shift them & see.

457
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:10,615
What's this? Why do you create so much
smoke like a dream sequence?

458
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:14,758
Shut up. Can't you
cut your hair?

459
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:17,257
Shut up! This's going to be
a fashion in 2005.

460
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:20,522
Watch out! Even Capt. Vijaykanth
will sport this hair style.

461
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,757
Not only that, for all priests,

462
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,936
it's traditional to sport
such a hair style...

463
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,761
Are you atleast doing that properly?

464
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,768
Wherever you go, you create trouble.
- What to do?

465
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,009
Last week, the marriage which
l had attended as a priest,

466
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,371
at the time of giving
the auspicious thread,

467
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,104
l saw the groom's face
and got shocked...

468
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:41,115
l had performed that rascal's
marriage a month earlier.

469
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,377
l was tensed.

470
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,951
l took a brick from
sacrificial fire,

471
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,954
asked him, ''How many girl's lives
are you going to ruin'',

472
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,123
l threw it on his face.

473
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,455
That's all.
He started to bleed profusely.

474
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:53,789
Then, it stopped.

475
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:54,794
Did the bleeding stop?

476
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,125
No...marriage was stopped.

477
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:59,997
lt's enough if you perform your job
properly without creating problem today.

478
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,138
You knot the hair soon...
l'll conduct it excellently...

479
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:02,806
l've already done it.

480
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,238
Rogues are not traveling on the
foot-board these days.

481
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,910
After the arrival of D.C. Arusaamy...

482
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,579
lf they do, they're beaten black & blue.

483
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,942
Oh God! l've lost my chain...

484
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:13,583
Driver, go to the police station...

485
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,015
Check every one.

486
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:20,921
Don't spare anyone.

487
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,454
Brahmin girl!

488
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,522
Stand in a line.

489
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,532
Can't you recognize a thief by face?
Do we look like thieves?

490
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,724
Didn't you throw
chili powder on our faces?

491
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,371
Hey! What's happening there?
- Sir, chain snatching...

492
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,206
They are making even girls
to stand in a line.

493
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,708
Why is he staring at us?

494
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,381
Show me your bag.
- We are getting late to college.

495
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,055
First check us...

496
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,656
Paramasivam, send them first.

497
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,985
Women police are coming
to check women.

498
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,888
When will they come
and when will we go?

499
00:34:59,097 --> 00:34:59,995
lt's alright, send them.

500
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,723
Sir, l'll not allow anyone
to disturb me in my duty.

501
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,925
Because, l'm not a police man
but a rogue.

502
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,705
You can go...
- What about the bus?

503
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,564
Bus will go after checking every one.

504
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,238
Then, how will we go?
- Go by an auto.

505
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:14,535
Money?

506
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:18,841
Don't you carry Rs.20, while going
to the college? - Rs.20!

507
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,642
We've a student bus pass.

508
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,753
lf by chance we lose it,
we've Rs.5 for to & fro fare.

509
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,946
We've curd rice & pickle for lunch.

510
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:28,591
Apart from this, why should a
college girl carry money?

511
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,789
Okay, l'll give you money.

512
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:34,429
Hey! Call an auto.
- We don't want other's money.

513
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,499
Okay, take it as loan
& repay it later.

514
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,199
His mind is getting distracted.

515
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:47,704
Sir, my wife isn't happy
about my late coming.

516
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:48,776
Atleast today let's go early.

517
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,914
Wait, let the night show be over.

518
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:54,282
He'll neither marry & enjoy
nor allow me to enjoy.

519
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,452
Why are you blabbering?

520
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:59,049
l was talking about the
greatness of bachelor's life.

521
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,789
Who's that?
Where are you coming from?

522
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,526
Sir, we went to a movie.
- Movie?

523
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:05,457
Didn't your husbands come with you?

524
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,322
No Sir.

525
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,123
Where is your house? - Vagedu.

526
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,266
Vagedu?...Are you going there
alone at this late hour?

527
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:12,231
Take this torch.
- No, it's alright.

528
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:13,528
lt's alright, take it.

529
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,603
Ask your husband to return it
in the station tomorrow.

530
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,400
Take it. - Okay sir, bye.

531
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,745
Sir take it. You've helped my wife.
Thank you very much.

532
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,781
Wife? Hey! Are you a man?

533
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,919
Neither you were courageous to take
your wife to the night show,

534
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:32,817
Nor you had the guts to
stop her from going alone.

535
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,218
Then, why did you marry?

536
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,390
After not stopping her from
going alone,

537
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:39,324
You complain that she has been
robbed, raped, murdered etc..

538
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,499
Hey! There are 550 million women
in our country.

539
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,497
ls it possible to provide police
security to every woman?

540
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,170
Paramasivam, hereafter you arrest
all the husbands,

541
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,671
Who send their wives alone to
movies. - Yes sir.

542
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,636
lf he had married, he would've known
the problem of a husband. - What?

543
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,572
Sir, nothing. l just tested whether
this torch is working or not.

544
00:36:54,879 --> 00:37:00,044
A white cat is living
in my house.

545
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,448
What's this Hubby?
Who are they?

546
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:07,989
They're very tired children.
Serve them food.

547
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:10,786
Oh God! lt's a great sin.
- Sin?

548
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,168
Why grandpa is shouting like this?
- Did he get a stroke?

549
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,134
Don't blabber. They're offering
food to the crows.

550
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,900
You'll offer food to the crows.
Won't you offer it to them?

551
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:27,202
Crows are our forefathers,
our ancestors.

552
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,380
Ancestors? ls an ordinary crow
your grandfather?

553
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,606
ls Raven, your great grand father?

554
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,375
Whom are you fooling?

555
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:38,715
Hey! Don't criticize the traditions,
you fool. - Forgive me grandpa.

556
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,915
Crows may satiate their hunger
by picking or stealing food.

557
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:45,323
Blue cross also protects them.

558
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:49,966
But for the poor & uneducated
like them,

559
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,795
White cross like us are
here to help.

560
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,268
Grandpa, do you know, because
of the food you offer to crows,

561
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,270
How many problems politicians
have to face?

562
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:58,100
What do you mean?

563
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,277
lt eats gravy food here,

564
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:03,970
And a rotten `Masal vada'
from a shop,

565
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:07,673
Mutton piece
from a mutton shop.

566
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:10,149
Eating all this, its stomach
gets upset.

567
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,585
Lastly they go & sit over
the Politician's head,

568
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,588
And shit like this.

569
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,227
Don't you've Rs.50? What's this man?
...Go, man...

570
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:28,267
Sir, l asked for his license
and he said `No'.

571
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,632
That's why, l warned him.

572
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,102
l believe...l believe you...

573
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,166
Why do you ask Rs.50 and
insult the police?

574
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:36,039
You ask Rs.500. To escape from the
trouble, he'll take a license,

575
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:37,544
And you can also avoid
asking bribes frequently.

576
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:42,412
ls he asking me take bribe or not?
l don't get him.

577
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,181
Why are you dull for the
past 2 days?

578
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:51,389
Hey! DC is there, l'll return
the auto fare.

579
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:55,924
Bus may start...
- l'll come back before that.

580
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,997
When will it be finished?
- The judgement is on 10th of next month.

581
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:02,195
You said, it's one day's work.
Remind me about it. - Yes sir.

582
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,802
Hello, What's it?

583
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:08,604
That day you gave me Rs.22.50
as auto fare, take it...

584
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:13,011
lt was Rs.45, why're you giving me
only Rs.22.50? - Rs.45?

585
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:18,345
Metre showed only Rs.22.50...
- He asked me for the return fare of Rs.22.50.

586
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:19,523
Oh God!

587
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:24,184
To repay Rs.22.50, l was
sleepless for 2 days.

588
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,522
l packed chili powder
in 60 packets.

589
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:32,098
Oh God! l missed the bus.
How will l go now? - You go by an auto.

590
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,965
What about the auto fare?
- How many of you've started this business?

591
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:38,141
You may not have much money,
but only Rs.5 for bus fare.

592
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:39,604
For lunch, you would've curd rice
& pickle.

593
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,540
No, today l've sambar rice & `pulse'
curry. - Let it be anything.

594
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:45,038
You'll say that why does a college girl
need money more than this?

595
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:47,774
Take it back. Keep your cash bag
with yourself.

596
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:48,950
Hey! Auto...

597
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,214
Your money... - Repay the total
money later.

598
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:56,050
Hey! Wait.

599
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,091
What's your name? - Sir, Murugan.

600
00:39:58,295 --> 00:39:59,887
Which area? - Pettai.

601
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,723
You know the station phone number?
- Yes sir.

602
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,991
lnform me on phone after dropping her.
- Okay sir. - Go.

603
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:09,703
Dhanam brother. - Yes sir.

604
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,670
You follow that auto.

605
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,002
Why did he ask you to
phone him?

606
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,304
l look like a rowdy, don't l?
That's why, he suspects me.

607
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,083
ls DCP your relative? He's very concerned
about you! - Nothing like that.

608
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,283
Then, why is he sending a
constable to follow us?

609
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:30,819
After Saamy sir's arrival, Tirunelveli
junction is entirely changed.

610
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,893
All those vandals on roads have
gone into hibernation.

611
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,565
Wow, whether the auto runs or not,
metre runs perfectly...

612
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,234
He's an honest man...

613
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,706
Do you know how much
he's concerned about me?

614
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,043
Don't move around with a policeman. Forget it,
or else l'll inform aunt.

615
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:59,287
You tell aunt or Saamy (god).
- Again Saamy!

616
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,220
He's a good person...
He's an honest man.

617
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:04,792
Bhuvana, do you know who's the guest
for tomorrow's function?

618
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,622
Deputy Commissioner Saamy!

619
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,101
What's it Annachi?
You've made me jobless.

620
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,206
Earlier atleast once in a month
we used to hear the blasts.

621
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,535
Now, there's no sound and l feel as
if l've become deaf.

622
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:22,473
Don't you know anything else
other than planting bombs?

623
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:27,850
l've made you the proprietor of a
35 acre crackers factory in Sivakasi.

624
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:31,579
You're standing here like a lamp post
leaving behind your brain in Sivakasi.

625
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:34,952
A dog will always remain loyal
to lick it's boss's feet.

626
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,389
lf we allow him, he may plant
a bomb here itself.

627
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,028
First send him to Sivakasi.

628
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,424
Brother, come let's go
to bus station.

629
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:41,996
l'll call you when l need you.

630
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:45,567
Greetings, sir... - Greeting sir...

631
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,095
Annachi...

632
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:48,168
He is taking bath.

633
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,475
Generally people can hold breath
for 2 minutes under water.

634
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:55,345
But Annachi can hold for 10 minutes.

635
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,672
Welcome Saamy.

636
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:01,576
What are you looking at?

637
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,950
Surprised as to how l know about
your arrival?

638
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:10,190
Even from under 10 feet water,
l can recognize anyone.

639
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,862
l'm used to take bath here
since my childhood.

640
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:15,827
Neither l know it's virtues
nor sins..

641
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,462
l made him a MLA.

642
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:24,732
But, he made tall promises that
he'll give this & that,

643
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,603
Sanction water supply etc.,
on the stage.

644
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,711
Believing him, farmers are
waiting with their implements.

645
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:34,317
Even CM used to ask me before
saying anything on the stage.

646
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,543
He went over board.

647
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:40,188
Tirunelveli is receiving Tamarabarani
water after l take my bath in it.

648
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,422
Saamy, don't mistake me.

649
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:45,891
l'm a friendly type but if l
get angry, l'll not spare anybody.

650
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:48,656
All having Tata Sumos,
Qualis etc.,

651
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:51,391
Are you wondering why l'm
still using Ambassador?

652
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:54,397
Astrologer told me that if l lose
this car my life will be in danger.

653
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:57,539
Nagarajan of 75th ward is
troubling us using your name.

654
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:00,971
Hey! Who's that rascal? Playing politics
without our knowledge!

655
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:02,345
Ask him to meet me...

656
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:04,914
l'll take care of him, you go.
- l'll get along.

657
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:08,408
He's the right man. He consults me
& does everything...

658
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:14,415
District Magistrate who's the Chief Guest
here on this lndependence day..

659
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:17,924
After you've come to Tirunelveli
crime rate has come down a lot.

660
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:21,091
Whatever help you want, tell me...

661
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:24,396
As a Judge, l'll definitely do the
needful. - Thank you sir.

662
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:29,095
l'll request the Deputy Commissioner
Arusaamy to give a speech.

663
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,535
l like Tirunelveli ''Halwa''.

664
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,438
Becareful, he might cheat you.

665
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:40,382
l like girls in this town
more than that.

666
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:42,948
Don't mistake me.

667
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:44,678
l like your courage...

668
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,783
ln this town, the way the
girls carry umbrellas,

669
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:50,626
l feel as if they're
carrying sickles.

670
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:56,625
Normally, men will trouble women.

671
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,962
He may be a thief or a rogue.
You shouldn't get scared of them.

672
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,965
l'm not asking you to carry
weapons for self protection.

673
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:03,465
Even chili powder in
your house will do.

674
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,640
l've the experience of being attacked
by the chili powder.

675
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:07,970
Hey! He's referring to you.

676
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:11,143
ln this town, when we went in search
of a house in civil dress, a girl...

677
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:16,486
A girl mistook us as thieves
and locked us inside a room.

678
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:17,988
She threw chili powder on us.

679
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,587
She's a student of
your college.

680
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,417
Who's she?

681
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:24,822
The girl wearing black
upper cloth...that girl.

682
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:26,826
lt's you only.

683
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:28,596
lt'll be better if you come on
the dais yourself.

684
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:34,829
He's calling you.
Go...go.

Bhuvana, please come to the stage.

686

your lips near my ears.

Saamy gave me the garland.
- What?

00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:03,699
l mean a garland which was
offered to Saamy(God)

Oh, God's garland!

Hey, they're from a different caste.

l want them also to join us.
- They are from other caste.

Colour difference must be

Not in the hearts of people.

You are calling them as others.
Who are they?

724
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:33,062
They laid these roads.
They built your houses.

725
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:36,061
They are the people who vote in
elections. They wash your clothes.

726
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:39,235
They hold breath and clean sewages,
diving into them.

727

Rice, Wheat & Flour,

They are the people
who produce them.

how'll we get food?

We were eagerly waiting for
chocolates. You spoiled that too.

for you only.

Today, it's our lndependence Day!

On this day, you must know about
a great freedom fighter.

Look at this.

Did you see? Do you know him?

737

him, isn't it?

What are you saying boy?

739
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:09,758
He's the kidnapper who abducted
Rajkumar & Nagappa, isn't he?

740
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:14,596
Just for the moustache, you've made
Poet Bharati into brigand Veerappan.

741
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:19,601
Bharati, are you closing your ears
with head gear not to hear this?

Greetings leader!

lt seems you've started a new party.
Admit me into your party.

Hey, when did l start a party?

You've hoisted a colourful flag.
You've gathered a crowd around you.

746
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:34,185
Can't you differentiate between National
flag & a Party flag, when you're drunk?

l'm your party's Propaganda Secretary.

That is P.S.!

You're not P.S. For me, you're
the murderer Godse.

750
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:46,198
They are from a very
poor family.

751

You must find the stolen jewellery
& return it to them.

752
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:51,866
You're saying 30 sovereigns
of gold and 40,000 cash.

753
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:54,873
Will you keep them in this ramshackle
bureau instead of bank?

754
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:58,214
You seem to be senseless people.
- Please, find it somehow.

755
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:00,883
You're asking us to find them,
as if we know where they're.

756
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:02,483
Can we visualize with
extra sensory perception?

757
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:04,477
Hey, tell me man!
Tell me your name.

758
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:05,387
Narayanan!

759
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:06,556
When did it happen?

760
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:08,485
l don't know!

761
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:12,220
Did you go to the temple with the
entire family leaving them at home?

762
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:21,233
Yes, Saamy!
- l'm Bhuvana speaking.

763
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:22,230
Which Bhuvana?

764
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:24,907
You know me and l know you.

765
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,840
Oh! Chili powder!
What's the matter?

766
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:34,307
Modus-operandi! - He had bent
window bars.

767
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:36,085
To open the bureau he had
used a crow bar.

768
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,751
We've informed finger print experts.
Police sniffer dogs are on the way.

769
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:44,593
Hello!

770
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:47,763
Paramasivam, get me the list of
thieves who use crow bars.

771
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:48,760
One minute sir.

772
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:50,591
Tell me!

773
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,768
Setta Muthu, Melapalayam Anwar,
Market Radha, Palayamkottai David...

774
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,937
Atthupalayam Buddhar and
Vallanadu Mottai, sir.

775
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:57,936
Trace out all of them and inform me.
- Okay sir.

776
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:02,275
Sir, they're my 35 years savings.

777
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:05,614
lt's your hard earned money,
you'll get them.

778
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:08,784
Sir, 5 are available.
Vallanadu Mottai is missing.

779
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:10,213
Find him!

780
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,347
l had saved the jewels
for her marriage.

781
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:16,288
lf we don't get them back,

782
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,623
Our entire family must
commit suicide.

783
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:20,360
Why are you crying?
Be brave.

784
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:22,794
Sir, Vallanadu Mottai has stolen them.

785
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:23,795
What are you saying, man?

786
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,628
He has informed B-2 Police lnspector
on phone about the theft.

787
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:29,304
lt's shameful!
Where's the accused now?

788
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:30,803
We've arrested him at
Kaitharu check post.

789
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,133
First bring those jewels
and cash immediately,

790
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:34,303
Or else a family will
commit suicide.

791
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:41,984
Make the date as 12.

792
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:44,911
Yes, Paramasivan. - Take it!

793
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:48,153
These are your jewels, aren't they?
Check them.

794
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:50,152
Sir! - What's this sir?

795
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,987
You're like my father, why are
you falling at my feet?

796
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:53,992
You're like God to
our family.

797
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:57,332
You take their statement. - Yes sir.
- You've saved our lives.

798
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:59,593
We'll be indebted to you all our lives.
- l'll get along.

799
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:05,674
You caught the thief by
investigating brilliantly.

800
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:08,343
l'm proud of you.
Reduce your girths,

801
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:10,410
Or else you won't be able to
see your own shoes also.

802
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:13,342
Didn't you get any
pirated VCD's?

803
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:14,517
You all are going to theatre,
aren't you?

804
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:17,016
Venkatrama, an injustice is going on
in this neighbourhood.

805
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,016
What's going on?

806
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:22,351
lt seems a policeman comes here
and finds a thief in one hour.

807
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,186
Are they stealing themselves
and returning,

808
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:27,192
Or is it a nexus between police
and thieves? l've a doubt.

809
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:29,024
lf they find, you'll accuse
them of a nexus.

810
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:30,529
lf they fail you'll accuse
them of incompetence.

811
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,702
People like you must be punched.

812
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:33,869
You might defend
them vociferously.

813
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,197
But when a sniffer dog takes
a day to find a thief,

814
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:38,040
How can he find in one hour?

815
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:41,039
lf Police decides, not in
one hour,

816
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:44,042
They can arrest you this very
minute under POTA...

817
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:46,374
How's it possible? - They can arrest
if you possess any weapon.

818
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:47,880
l don't have any weapon
in my possession.

819
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:48,880
Here, you've one.

820
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:53,545
He's having a weapon. Arrest him.
- Are you talking Law? Come man.

821
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:56,385
Here they are arresting on receiving
just one complaint.

822
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,887
There, a brigand is releasing
audio cassettes in the forest,

823
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:00,062
Arranging a press meet.

824
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:02,731
When are you going to
arrest him?

825
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:14,100
Brother, Police have been informed.
Saamy is coming here.

826
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:15,711
Who's this Saamy?

827
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:17,539
lf 10 people join and
do it, it's a criminal act.

828
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:19,874
lf 100 people join & do it,
it's a violent communal clash.

829
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:21,880
What's going to happen now
is the communal clash.

830
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,222
Disperse peacefully from here
without disturbing people.

831
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:36,899
A man from our caste has been killed.
We'll not stop.

832
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,567
lnvestigation is progressing.

833
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,065
lt's unlawful to gather a crowd
without permission.

834
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:43,637
We've been born & brought up here,
whose permission do we've to take?

835
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,902
l'm warning you for the last time,
disperse immediately.

836
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,634
lf we don't, will you
baton charge us?

837
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:49,812
Will you stop us with brick bats,

838
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,571
Or disperse us using
tear gas shells?

839
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:56,343
Whatever it is, we are not
going to disperse.

840
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:05,192
Look, he's running away.

841
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:27,173
Saamy, are you a Policeman
or a rowdy?

842
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:32,853
l'm not a fool to get hacked by you
with a baton & brickbat.

843
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:38,727
l'm not an idiot policeman to wait for
Collector's order to fire below knees.

844
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:39,988
l'm Saamy.

845
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,798
Are you using bad words publicly?
- What will you do?

846
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,766
lf you kill us,
l'll also kill you.

847
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:47,128
Will you burn down a bus?
l'll burn you down!

848
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:48,895
lf you kill us, it's a murder.

849
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:50,897
lf l kill you,
it's an enquiry commission.

850
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:53,132
l know how to face that
enquiry commission.

851
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:57,243
lf you like to fight, go to Vallanadu
mountains, fight & die there.

852
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:59,472
Why are you entering the town and
disturbing the peace?

853
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:01,741
Saamy, do you know against
whom you're going?

854
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,441
You're going against a
powerful caste.

855
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:11,324
You'll find all these
names in thousands.

856
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:15,829
One in 100 millions will be named as
Arusaamy. l'm one in 100 million.

857
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:18,926
lf you go against me, l'll exterminate
your entire group.

858
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:19,999
Be careful!

859
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:23,230
l'm not a Policeman but
a rogue.

860
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:29,444
Sir, you said something,
what does it mean?

861
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:33,707
Rotten egg and foolish monkey!
- Oh, doesn't it have a bad meaning?

862
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:35,441
Hold it tightly, don't loosen
the bedspread.

863
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:40,417
Bloody idiots!

864
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,454
Who used so much herbal medicine
for inhaling vapours,

865
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,727
As if it's to be given to a cattle?
- l used for immediate...

866
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,487
My life? - No, cold!

867
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:48,220
That's alright!

868
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:51,996
l'll add poison to the food you eat.
You'll reach heaven.

869
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:55,171
Annachi, today he had threatened
that caste.

870
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:56,599
ln future, he might go
against us also.

871
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:59,331
Hey, why are you getting
such crazy ideas?

872
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:01,340
Saamy is our man.

873
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:04,172
He'll never go against us.
You go...

874
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:10,178
Sir, let's shift the Police station
to the bus stand. - Why?

875
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:13,617
We are always here.
- lt's peak hour!

876
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,522
Peak hour or girl hour! - Hey!

877
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:20,518
ln the morning, you're standing there
& in the evening you're here.

878
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,857
lt's sunny there in the morning
& sunny here in the evening.

879
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,091
Are you standing here for the Sun
or the girl?

880
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:29,534
Saamy is standing there.

881
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:33,872
Are you disappointed that he hasn't
turned to see you?

882
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:37,046
Shall l call him? ... Saamy!
- Hey, keep quiet!

883
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:49,321
Hello!

884
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:10,079
Bundle him into the jeep.

885
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:17,242
He's itching for trouble.
Take him away, bloody rogue.

886
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,078
lf l'm a little careless,
l think he'll kill me also.

887
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:27,091
l've curd rice & pickle
for lunch.

888
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,589
Why does a college going girl
need money for other than this.

889
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,773
Madam, DC told me to
give this to you.

890
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,134
Silence, what's this trouble
in front of a temple?

891
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:08,463
We've bought a new elephant
for our neighbourhood temple.

892
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:10,138
Did you buy it? Very good.

893
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,468
Are you going to make it
beg in the shops around here?

894
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:14,973
That isn't the problem.
- What's the problem?

895
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:18,477
There's a temple inside dedicated to
Lord Vishnu & Lord Shiva separately.

896
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:19,807
lt's a known fact!

897
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:22,143
Do we've to mark the elephant
with Lord Vishnu's symbol,

898
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:23,819
r the sacred ash symbol of Lord Shiva, that's the probler

899
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:25,779
Oh, have you started that problem?

900
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:27,853
Does the elephant know
about this problem?

901
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:32,050
How can it know, it's an animal?
- ls it the only animal here?

902
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:36,992
Silence! You're arguing about
Lord Vishnu's & Lord Shiva's symbols.

903
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,828
Did anyone of you think of
making it wear a shirt?

904
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:42,501
You've seen film
''Kalikambal'', haven't you?

905
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:44,502
ln that film, the elephant
wears a shirt.

906
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:47,505
First tell us, whose side are you,
their's or our's?

907
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,769
Aunt, Lord Vishnu & Shiva
are one & the same.

908
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,341
Those who're ignorant of this are
useless. l believe in this thought.

909
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:56,348
So, l'm sporting a ''Rudraksh'' here &
Lord Vishnu's symbol on my forehead.

910
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:57,712
Both are same to me.

911
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,514
l don't know whether you'll mark it
with Lord Vishnu's or Shiva's symbol.

912
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:05,023
lt's going to drop dung now.
First decide who's going to clean it.

913
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:06,960
You... you...

914
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,966
He's right hand and
left hand of my Annachi.

915
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,368
As the girl was chubby & beautiful,
he molested her.

916
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,401
Will you do it, if your
sisters are like that?

917
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,465
Take him away!

918
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:19,967
Don't stare at me after
committing the mistake.

919
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:20,972
Shall l go, Saamy?

920
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:24,811
Hey, Manickam, MLA is
taking him away!

921
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,576
Hey, look there.

922
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:33,349
Sir, we thought you were a good
and honest policeman.

923
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,987
You've released him.

924
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,154
Be patient.

925
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,657
How can l be patient?
He has molested my sister.

926
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:40,495
Can we do anything if we've money?

927
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,327
Have you finished?

928
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,392
Okay l'll arrest him now.

929
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:47,327
They'll transfer me from here,
l'm not bothered about it.

930
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:48,728
Another Officer will come.

931
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:50,337
He'll release him and arrest
you under Goondas Act.

932
01:01:50,573 --> 01:01:51,335
He'll foist a theft case
on your father.

933
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:53,939
He'll brand your sister as prostitute
and ruin your entire family.

934
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:56,509
So, do we've to endure all this?
- You've to.

935
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,013
You're waiting patiently in a queue
for kerosene in a ration shop,

936
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:01,672
And for tickets in a theatre.
How can you get instant justice?

937
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,515
lf the case goes to Court,

938
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:09,352
They'll put embarrassing questions
and kill that girl alive.

939
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:12,192
A secret between us will
become an open secret.

940
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,521
Then, isn't there any way
to get justice?

941
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,858
Putting such rogues in jail isn't
just punishment for them.

942
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:20,866
Against Law, we must stone him to death
or shoot him to death publicly.

943
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,539
Such a situation will come,
then l'll give you a sickle.

944
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,369
Till then, retain this anger on him.
- Sir, Annachi has called you.

945
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,504
Tell him, l'll come. - He has asked you
to come immediately, sir.

946
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,377
Rascal!

947
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,179
Bloody!

948
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:45,620
What do you think of me?

949
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,890
Am l your servant or
your broom?

950
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,895
He's calling me authoritatively
as if l'm his watchman.

951
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,229
l've self esteem & self respect. l'll not
give them up under any circumstances.

952
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:57,303
The money you pay me is fee
for the mistakes you commit.

953
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,575
lt's a price for not
doing my duty.

954
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:02,740
l'll respect only Perumal Pitchai.

955
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:05,243
l don't care for any other beggar
who begs from him.

956
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:09,077
lf you still do it, l'll pump bullets
into everyone of you here.

957
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:12,315
King will kill on the same day.
God will kill leisurely,

958
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:15,049
And l'll kill without leaving
any evidence. Be careful.

959
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:17,957
Annachi, he's abusing us loudly and
you're watching.

960
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:21,821
He's definitely from our caste only.

961
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:25,495
When he was speaking in anger,
his ears turned red. Did you see?

962
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:28,101
He meant all of us and
you're talking about his caste.

963
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,272
l had told you to call him.

964
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:31,997
Did you cross the limits and
invited trouble here?

965
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:36,435
A Tiger will crouch to pounce
on the prey. Be careful.

966
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:39,180
Hey, stop the jeep.

967
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:41,846
Why is she standing here without
going to college?

968
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:45,612
Sir, where're you now?

969
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:46,846
l'm on my way to
Commissioner's office.

970
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:48,349
lsn't that chili powder
girl there..

971
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:49,422
Yes, so what?

972
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,752
She's standing at the bus stop for a
long time. Did you ask her to come?

973
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:53,087
Okay...l'm coming there immediately.

974
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:54,530
Then, Commissioner?

975
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:55,526
l'll meet him later.

976
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:57,199
That's it.

977
01:03:57,733 --> 01:03:59,360
When it comes to love
even God will falter.

978
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:02,195
Can Saamy stay away from faltering?
Start the jeep.

979
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:21,988
Why're you standing here?

980
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:23,158
l want to talk to you...

981
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:37,201
About what?

982
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:41,243
Why didn't you come for
the last 4 days?

983
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:44,169
l went to Madurai for
CM's programme, why?

984
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:48,883
What happened?
Why're you crying?

985
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:52,244
l feel lost without seeing you.

986
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:54,923

you every day.

987

Okay, hereafter, you'll always
be with me only.

989
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:03,598
How?

990

lf l marry you, won't you be always
with me?

Yes.

01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:32,448
Excuse me. l've come to know from uncle
that the groom takes bribes.

1057
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:34,279
This is an honest and straight
forward family.

1058
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:37,550
You leave the place, it'll not suit you.
- ls this the respectful way?

1059
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:39,119
Then, l'll do one thing.

1060
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:43,628
l'll pack some crisps and
chutney for you. Go away.

1061
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:44,560
Hey Tuft!

1062
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:45,893
Are you calling me tuft?

1063
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:48,796
lf l tie this tuft,
it's personality.

1064
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:51,401
lf l untie, it's university.

1065
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:55,141
lf l show my character,
it's municipality.

1066
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:59,644
Shall l tie, untie or show you?
Tell me. - Son-in-law.

1067
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:01,816
You can leave...go...go.

1068
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:04,979
What happened? - My father has
refused the proposal.

1069
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:07,155
Saved me from creating trouble,
okay, l'll go now.

1070
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:09,655
Why did he refuse the proposal?

1071
01:12:09,925 --> 01:12:11,324
lt seems the bridegroom
takes bribes.

1072
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:14,422
My father has come to know about it.
So, he rejected him.

1073
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:17,326
What was that noise?

1074
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:19,326
Nothing.

1075
01:12:19,535 --> 01:12:20,661
Police quarters.

1076
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:22,336
Sister!

1077
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:24,566
Hey chili powder?
How come you're here?

1078
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:26,174
Give me his house keys.

1079
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:28,104
Why're you asking DC's
house keys?

1080
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:30,778
He's always eating in Hotels.

1081
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:33,348
So, l've come to cook for him.

1082
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:35,181
l've asked him to come
home for lunch.

1083
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:35,941
Oh!

1084
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:38,915
ls it dress rehearsal before marriage?
Restrict it to cooking only.

1085
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:40,780
What is his favourite food?

1086
01:12:40,989 --> 01:12:44,015
Except a flying plane & a floating ship,
he'll eat everything.

1087
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:48,726
Sir, they're adulterating petrol
in the gas station.

1088
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:50,728
Adulteration is in everything.
Go & complain to the Consumer court.

1089
01:12:50,933 --> 01:12:52,400
Sir, they've attacked a woman.
- What're you saying?

1090
01:12:52,601 --> 01:12:54,398
Look there, sir.
- What happened?

1091
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:55,900
When l complained about the shortage
of petrol he supplied.

1092
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:58,005
They kicked my scooter
and pushed me down.

1093
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,402
What're you looking at?
First take her to a hospital. Go...go.

1094
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:01,234
l don't want all that.

1095
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:03,741
l'll not budge till l find a way out
for this problem. - What's this?

1096
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:11,182
How much sir! - One litre.

1097
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,350
We'll not supply in bottles.

1098
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:19,519
Come on.

1099
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:40,377
ls it one litre?

1100
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:43,545
Sir, why did you beat him?

1101
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,550
Who beat that woman?
Tell me...tell me.

1102
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:47,221
Why're you beating him, sir?

1103
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:49,721
How dare you beat a woman?

1104
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:53,383
Sir, why're you beating us?
- Tell me, who beat that woman?

1105
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:57,053
You don't have any right to ask us.
This is Annachi's petrol station. - Go away.

1106
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:58,733
Are you giving 3/4 litre
for one litre?

1107
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:00,561
There's another department
to enquire all this.

1108
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:02,236
Anyone can enquire about
your short supply.

1109
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,406
Any department can ask you.

1110
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:06,233
Sir, this man had kicked me.

1111
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:11,072
Sir, don't beat me.
- Where're you running away?

1112
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,076
Do you think there's no one
to question you?

1113
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,248
Get everyone into the jeep.

1114
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:16,910
Close the petrol station
and seal it.

1115
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:20,346
Annachi, DC has sealed
our petrol station.

1116
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,904
Greetings sir.
- Where's your D.C.?

1117
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:16,134
He has gone home for lunch.

1118
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:21,475
Brother Paramasivan saide that you like
non-vegetarian food very much.

1119
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,647
l don't know to cook
non-vegetarian. Sorry.

1120
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:26,814
But, l'll learn to cook
non-vegetarian after marriage.

1121
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:27,647
Hey Chili Powder!

1122
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,917
Ever since l fell in love with you,
l've reduced taking non-vegetarian.

1123
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:32,991
l'll stop it completely after marriage.

1124
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,997
Great! Fantastic!

1125
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:47,671
Do you know what my friends say?
l'm very lucky. - Why?

1126
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:49,271
lt seems you're
straight forward.

1127
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:52,009
And earned a good name
from all quaters. - ls it?

1128
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:54,511
There's only one thing which
l don't like in you.

1129
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,348
That one gray hair
in your moustache.

1130
01:15:57,553 --> 01:16:00,681
Shall l remove it?
- No...my lucky hair.

1131
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:03,355
l'll remove it one day.
- Let me see.

1132
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:25,212
You please sit down. - Okay.

1133
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:31,148
l say, wait.

1134
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:32,849
Who's that?

1135
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:36,216
Are you married?

1136
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:37,884
Who's this girl?

1137
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:40,392
Are you having intimate relations with girls?

1138
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:42,894
Do whatever you feel like doing?

1139
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:44,895
Why're you troubling me?

1140
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:49,566
Are you sealing my
petrol station?

1141
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:55,566
ls it the way to show your loyalty
towards the millions l paid you?

1142
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,578
Even the food that's sticking
in your hand.

1143
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,752
Was bought by the money
l gave you as alms.

1144
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:14,089
lf l don't like anyone l'll kill
him even if he's my sibling.

1145
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:17,856
By staying with me, are you trying
to go against me?

1146
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:23,594
l'm a man who will burn an
entire place to kill one man.

1147
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:26,607
lf you go against me next time.

1148
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:28,435
No one can find even the place
where you were killed.

1149
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,271
Or find any clue
about your grave.

1150
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,709
l'll shred you into pieces.

1151
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:36,947
We'll go...go.

1152
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:46,623
Please listen to me.

Wait...do you know what they had done?

1154
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:50,628
Without knowing the truth...

1155
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:53,624
l thought you were a good man.
- Please listen to me.

1156
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:55,962
Leave me.

1157
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:57,972
Don't go away in haste.

1158
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:25,725
Annachi, petrol bunk is opened.

1159
01:18:25,934 --> 01:18:28,562
Hey, is it a finance company
to open & close frequently?

1160
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:29,896
The insult which
we've faced, is history.

1161
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:31,902
The day he entered our house
we should've taught him a lesson.

1162
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:33,766
What do you want me to do?
Tell me, Annachi....

1163
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:36,737
As a woman got hurt,
he got angry.

1164
01:18:37,112 --> 01:18:39,080
We asked many times...
but, he didn't reply.even once...

1165
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:41,579
Hey, forget about it.

1166
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:45,483
Hey, this news shouldn't be
published in evening's newspaper.

1167
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:54,595
Bhuvana.... - Don't touch me.

1168
01:18:55,297 --> 01:18:56,924
Listen to me...
- What's left to say?

1169
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:58,724
What happened was....
- lt's enough.

1170
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:02,099
The faith which l had on you is lost.

1171
01:19:02,637 --> 01:19:06,095
God won't forgive you
for deceiving a girl.

1172
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:07,605
Bhuvana, don't talk like a fool.

1173
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:09,936
l'm a fool to have believed a cheat
who cheats the town.

1174
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:12,109
Today, you used your position
and took money.

1175
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:14,748
Tomorrow, what's the guarantee that
you won't sell me? - Hey, stop it...

1176
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:19,147
l can just leave you & go away.

1177
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,421
But, you'll commit suicide
within a week.

1178
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:23,458
l can't bear that....

1179
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:26,055
Do you know why l took bribe?

1180
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:29,957
Every police man's job
has become commercial.

1181
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:33,301
But, l consider this uniform
as my honour.

1182
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:35,970
My father considered his
job as sacred.

1183

Whichever caste or religion a person
may belong to, if mistake is committed,

1184
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:43,311
Only police has the right to get it rectified.

1185
01:19:43,845 --> 01:19:46,814
That's why, l educated my son &
asked him to take up police job.

1186
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:49,643
Then, will Saamy become
lnspector in our place?

1187
01:19:49,851 --> 01:19:51,409
Why're you asking like
a competitor?

1188
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:54,822
lf my son gets a job....He'll become
an officer, in this place.

1189
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:01,818
Saamy, you've got an interview card.

1207
01:22:19,968 --> 01:22:26,601
When Aruasaamy will come in a procession
landlord will give respect to him.

1208
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:33,775
When Saamy sees the young girls
he'll fold his hands.

1209
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:20,222
<i>TAMlLlNl</i>

1210
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:23,656
Oh Dear....Oh dear...

1211
01:23:23,898 --> 01:23:25,331
Oh dear...Where're you going?

1212
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:27,160
Oh dear...Oh dear...

1213
01:23:31,373 --> 01:23:44,514
Oh train...Oh train...

1214
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:48,018
Those who print fake currencies,

1215
01:23:48,723 --> 01:23:51,851
Those who charge high interest rates,

1216
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:55,526
Those who steal hens...and goats...

1217
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:58,699
Better reform yourselves
within six months.

1218
01:24:02,937 --> 01:24:06,031
lf you keep concubine
l'll not spare you.

1219
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:09,377
l'll smash those who
abuse their parents.

1220
01:24:10,078 --> 01:24:13,536
lf l see the boys playing
with marbles,catapults,

1221
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:16,717
l'll join them happily.

1222
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:24,052
He'll punish those who
commit mistakes.

1223
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:27,725
And if those people realise
their mistakes.

1224
01:24:27,929 --> 01:24:31,558
l swear, l don't want anything else
from them.

1225
01:25:27,889 --> 01:25:30,187
Son, how did your interview go?

1226
01:25:31,559 --> 01:25:33,026
Father, this job won't
be suitable for me.

1227
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:34,024
What do you mean?

1228
01:25:35,396 --> 01:25:36,363
l don't want it...
- Why?

1229
01:25:37,232 --> 01:25:38,859
Didn't you reply properly?

1230
01:25:40,235 --> 01:25:41,532
l would've replied
if they had questioned me.

1231
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:45,294
But they want bribe....
l Don't want it father.

1232
01:25:46,908 --> 01:25:50,036
You want the job but
you're hesitating.

1233
01:25:51,246 --> 01:25:54,545
How much they asked?
- 7 Lakhs, father.

1234
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:00,618
Father, what's all this?

1235
01:26:00,922 --> 01:26:03,982
l sold our fields for 5 lakhs.

1236
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:06,054
l've pledged the house for 2 lakhs.

1237
01:26:06,761 --> 01:26:07,659
By selling the fields...

1238
01:26:08,196 --> 01:26:10,164
Son, to get something
we've to lose something.

1239
01:26:11,432 --> 01:26:15,892
30 years ago, l exercised & conditioned
my body to become a policeman.

1240
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:19,300
As my father was unable
to give a mere Rs.8000,

1241
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:21,140
l was unable to get
that job.

1242
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:25,407
On the first day when
l worked in the fields.

1243
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:28,081
l can't express the anguish
which l went through.

1244
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:30,315
You shouldn't face
similar situation.

1245
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:32,082
You should get that job.

1246
01:26:32,954 --> 01:26:34,751
l started my work sincerely
in the office.

1247
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:37,915
But it's feed back was....
Politicians problems...

1248
01:26:38,226 --> 01:26:39,591
l got a bad name
among higher officials.

1249
01:26:39,794 --> 01:26:40,761
l got transferred frequently.

1250
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:43,256
Atlast, they transferred
me to Trichy.

1251
01:26:44,799 --> 01:26:45,424
What's this, man?

1252
01:26:46,467 --> 01:26:48,435
You've joined very recently and you're
refusing to accept bribe from us!

1253
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:50,597
You must've got this job
by giving bribe.

1254
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:51,939
When are you going to get that money back?

1255
01:26:52,307 --> 01:26:55,105
You take as much as you want &
don't bother about it.

1256
01:26:58,146 --> 01:26:58,612
Sorry sir.

1257
01:27:00,148 --> 01:27:03,606
You should stop illicit liquor trade
rowdism & vandalism.

1258
01:27:04,652 --> 01:27:06,051
Or else, l've to do my duty.

1259
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:10,116
You should've given them,
saying ''Pattu has given it''.

1260
01:27:10,325 --> 01:27:12,725
l told them. But they've the
support of the new DCP.

1261
01:28:17,158 --> 01:28:18,455
Can you pound without a pestle?

1262
01:28:19,494 --> 01:28:22,190
Can you be in politics without rowdism?
You can't, isn't it?

1263
01:28:22,563 --> 01:28:25,691
Then, why've you arrested him?
Release him.

1264
01:28:26,067 --> 01:28:27,034
Do you've bail order?

1265
01:28:27,235 --> 01:28:29,203
You're a policeman, right?
Don't you know?

1266
01:28:29,504 --> 01:28:31,267
Today is Sunday. Can a bail order be got today?

1267
01:28:31,572 --> 01:28:32,869
l'll get it tomorrow
release him now.

1268
01:28:34,676 --> 01:28:38,237
FlR is registered. l can't release him
without bail order.

1269
01:28:38,446 --> 01:28:40,209
FlR! Tear it
& throw it away.

1270
01:28:44,519 --> 01:28:45,486
Beat him & lock him inside.

1271
01:28:47,021 --> 01:28:48,318
Did you hit our ward officer?

1272
01:28:48,523 --> 01:28:50,150
lf l hit him, He'll turn into pulp.

1273
01:28:50,358 --> 01:28:51,985
Why did you hit him?

1274
01:28:52,193 --> 01:28:54,320
Hey, as you've come in uniform,
you've saved your skin.

1275
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:56,156
Or else, l would've bashed you nicely.

1276
01:28:57,031 --> 01:28:58,430
We should immediately transfer him.

1277
01:28:58,866 --> 01:28:59,833
Transfer, won't be enough.

1278
01:29:00,535 --> 01:29:02,162
Like branding the cows coming for sale,

1279
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:04,497
We should
confine him to his house, without hitting him.

1280
01:29:05,206 --> 01:29:08,733
We should teach him that politicians
are born criminals.

1281
01:29:21,089 --> 01:29:21,885
We're from vigilance department.

1282
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:23,887
We've got the information that
you've taken bribe.

1283
01:29:24,425 --> 01:29:25,722
We've to check your jeep.

1284
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:30,724
For my sincerity...They suspended me
accusing me of taking bribe.

1285
01:29:31,599 --> 01:29:32,725
You should definitely attend the
marriage with your family.

1286
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:34,231
Will l fail to attend
Saamy's marriage?

1287
01:29:34,435 --> 01:29:36,232
lt seems, our kinsman is coming.

1288
01:29:37,605 --> 01:29:39,835
Welcome kinsman....
- Come here....

1289
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:40,564
What's it?

1290
01:29:41,609 --> 01:29:42,906
First stop distributing
the invitations.

1291
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:44,738
This marriage won't be performed
- What do you mean?

1292
01:29:44,946 --> 01:29:48,746
Your son has been arrested for
taking bribe in a prostitution case.

1293
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:50,076
Don't cast wrong aspersions.

1294
01:29:50,284 --> 01:29:51,911
Hey, who hasn't taken bribe
in the country?

1295
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:55,089
No fool will take bribe & get his name
published in the paper.

1296
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:57,587
No. This marriage won't be performed.
You stop this marriage.

1297
01:30:07,135 --> 01:30:07,601
Father...

1298
01:30:10,972 --> 01:30:12,098
Do you also believe it?

1299
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:16,500
l won't believe even if
Lord Muruga comes & says.

1300
01:30:17,812 --> 01:30:19,609
You won't do a wrong thing.

1301
01:30:20,148 --> 01:30:25,780
Our village people say that you
want to multiply 7 lakhs into 70 lakhs.

1302
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:27,115
Let them talk.

1303
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:30,448
This's the punishment
for being honest.

1304
01:30:30,992 --> 01:30:32,289
Justice & law are dead.

1305
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:34,959
What did law do to you,
for being honest?

1306
01:30:35,496 --> 01:30:37,191
lt suspended you & made you
to stay in the house.

1307
01:30:37,498 --> 01:30:40,126
Being brave is not enough,
you should be intelligent also.

1308
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,963
Without taking bribe....
They accused you of taking bribe.

1309
01:30:43,337 --> 01:30:44,861
Hereafter, you take bribe
& do good things.

1310
01:30:45,173 --> 01:30:46,640
You create a law for yourself.

1311
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:49,402
There may be 100's of
bad people in a place.

1312
01:30:49,677 --> 01:30:50,302
Forget about them.

1313
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:52,575
ln the same place there may
be four good people.

1314
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:54,008
You do good to them.

1315
01:30:54,816 --> 01:30:56,807
ln Epic Ramayanam, if Vali was
a good person.

1316
01:30:57,018 --> 01:30:58,485
Raman would've hit him
facing him.

1317
01:30:58,686 --> 01:31:01,348
Since he was a bad persons
be hit him from behind.

1318
01:31:01,556 --> 01:31:03,114
According to the rules of
the war, it's a sin.

1319
01:31:03,524 --> 01:31:05,788
But, according to human law
it's right.

1320
01:31:06,627 --> 01:31:10,324
Saamy, l had lost 5 children
before you were born...

1321
01:31:10,765 --> 01:31:14,292
You're my 6th child. That's why
l named you Arusaamy.(Six Swamy)

1322
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:20,164
You were born after
killing five children.

1323
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:22,500
You do anything for good things.

1324
01:31:22,844 --> 01:31:24,243
You kill anyone.

1325
01:31:25,713 --> 01:31:29,205
Nothing wrong in that.
There's no sin in that.

1326
01:31:32,587 --> 01:31:37,490
l struggled for six months to prove
myself innocent in the court.

1327
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:40,787
We can find Politicians & rich men
in all the places.

1328
01:31:41,229 --> 01:31:42,321
l can't reform all of them.

1329
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:45,124
That's why, as my father had said,
l changed myself.

1330
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,968
Or else, l wouldn't have stayed for
such a long time in this place.

1331
01:31:48,703 --> 01:31:51,297
Bhuvana, l didn't take bribe
from the public.

1332
01:31:51,906 --> 01:31:54,636
l took bribe from the evil persons
who deceive the Government.

1333
01:31:55,376 --> 01:31:58,368
Bribe, which l'm taking is like
offerings to God.

1334
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:02,108
lt'll go to temple's trust
but not to God.

1335
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:04,048
Believe me.

1336
01:32:10,424 --> 01:32:12,790
Hey, what's our caste & tradition.

1337
01:32:12,994 --> 01:32:14,359
We don't know who's he...

1338
01:32:14,562 --> 01:32:16,086
You've done such a mistake.

1339
01:32:16,297 --> 01:32:17,525
Mother, he's a good person.

1340
01:32:17,765 --> 01:32:20,962
What's your age? Why do
you think like this?

1341
01:32:21,235 --> 01:32:24,693
You call & talk to him... - Shut up.
That's why l wanted you,

1342
01:32:24,906 --> 01:32:27,898
to check whether your daughter is going
to college or somewhere else. - Silence.

1343
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:29,641
At this vulnerable age of falling in love,

1344
01:32:29,844 --> 01:32:31,277
lt's your mistake to send her
to college.

1345
01:32:31,479 --> 01:32:33,879
Now, who'll take the responsibility?

1346
01:32:34,081 --> 01:32:36,641
You call & talk to him.
- What to talk?

1347
01:32:36,851 --> 01:32:38,250
At teenage, while she is going
to college,

1348
01:32:38,452 --> 01:32:41,250
lf you wish to marry her,
then, the family will be in problem.

1349
01:32:41,455 --> 01:32:43,423
Will you please shut up?

1350
01:32:45,126 --> 01:32:49,085
Look, she won't be reformed by
pouring water on her.

1351
01:32:49,297 --> 01:32:53,028
You call that boy & talk to him.
That'll be better.

1352
01:32:55,603 --> 01:32:56,763
You take coffee.

1353
01:32:58,673 --> 01:33:00,197
To dissolve the sugar you mix the coffee well.
Tumble the coffee well.

1354
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,069
Only then, sugar will be dissolved.

1355
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:05,772
lt may be Hot...Cool it
and drink.

1356
01:33:10,618 --> 01:33:12,984
Don't sip...Pour it in
your mouth.

1357
01:33:14,055 --> 01:33:16,922
They're giving such elaborate instructions
for drinking coffee. Very funny!

1358
01:33:17,792 --> 01:33:23,025
We can't even imagine that our
girl loves a police officer.

1359
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:26,097
Grandma, it's wrong to love a thief.

1360
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:27,824
We're different from you.

1361
01:33:28,135 --> 01:33:30,501
With what faith can we marry
our daughter to you?

1362
01:33:30,738 --> 01:33:33,798
Apart from being a good husband
and a good son-in-law,

1363
01:33:33,908 --> 01:33:36,077
l'll be your son...You believe my words &
get your daughter married to me.

1364
01:33:36,077 --> 01:33:38,910
She's a very young girl. Not even
finished her college.

1365
01:33:39,113 --> 01:33:40,944
Before that, how can we
perform her marriage?

1366
01:33:41,148 --> 01:33:45,050
Don't worry, l'll treat your daughter
as a child. l'll keep her happy.

1367
01:33:45,319 --> 01:33:49,187
lf we accept your proposal
how much dowry will you expect?

1368
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:51,153
You give me one sovereign
of gold & Re.1 .

1369
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:54,260
Rs.1 ...What's this?
He's asking like CM's salary.

1370
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:57,363
Sir, do you consider us
beggars? - That's it.

1371
01:33:57,565 --> 01:33:59,863
My sons's monthly salary
is Rs.7000.

1372
01:34:00,067 --> 01:34:03,503
Our women earn Rs.10,000
monthly by packing spices.

1373
01:34:03,704 --> 01:34:05,695
Our son-in-law. - Why do you talk
about all that now? Forget it.

1374
01:34:05,906 --> 01:34:07,806
Let's talk about other things.
- Okay, let's forget it.

1375
01:34:08,009 --> 01:34:11,968
We'll offer you generously...
You ask unhesitatingly.

1376
01:34:12,179 --> 01:34:14,670
Then, you give one lakh &
100 sovereigns of Gold.

1377
01:34:14,882 --> 01:34:16,907
What's this? You're asking
in PM's range.

1378
01:34:17,418 --> 01:34:20,945
l don't want anything. You give me only
your daughter. That's enough.

1379
01:34:21,155 --> 01:34:23,146
l'm living for Bhuvana.

1380
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:26,121
Till l'm alive, l want to
live for Bhuvana.

1381
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,925
Bless me.

1382
01:34:28,129 --> 01:34:28,652
Hubby...

1383
01:34:29,764 --> 01:34:30,662
May you long live.

1384
01:34:32,266 --> 01:34:36,600
First son-in-law is a priest
& 2nd one is a policeman.

1385
01:34:36,837 --> 01:34:37,496
Grandpa...

1386
01:34:37,705 --> 01:34:40,674
What's it? Hubby...
- We like you very much.

1387
01:34:41,642 --> 01:34:42,904
l don't like this.

1388
01:34:48,049 --> 01:34:50,415
Your face shows that you're not happy.

1389
01:34:51,285 --> 01:34:53,412
Sir, l'll wait till you believe me
comprehensively.

1390
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:56,419
Sir, you seem to be a good person.

1391
01:34:57,024 --> 01:35:00,016
But, l've about 400 relatives
in `Ambasamudhiram'.

1392
01:35:00,227 --> 01:35:02,388
l don't know what to
tell them. - Uncle.

1393
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:05,097
You forget about 400 persons.
You select a good person.

1394
01:35:05,299 --> 01:35:08,860
Srinivasa, if l had a son & sought your
daughter's alliance, won't You accept?

1395
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:11,766
l'm considering him as my son &
asking your daughter's hand.

1396
01:35:12,873 --> 01:35:16,070
That day, when l fell at your feet
you said, ''l'm like your father.''

1397
01:35:16,277 --> 01:35:18,108
l don't know what you meant by that.

1398
01:35:18,312 --> 01:35:21,110
But, l consider you as my son.

1399
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:26,881
Why're you still thinking?
Say `yes'. - Okay.

1400
01:35:28,055 --> 01:35:31,024
ln the year of `Chitra Banu'
on Jan 4th...

1401
01:35:31,258 --> 01:35:35,126
Palani Sriram Chokka Lingam's son
Saamy(alias) Arusaamy.

Now, my dreams are coming true...

1408
01:36:21,909 --> 01:36:26,369
But, l've become your partner.

1409
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:35,318
The days which l count for the
marriage, are a pleasant burden...

1410
01:36:35,523 --> 01:36:40,085
Without separating the lips &
without raising the voice.

1411
01:36:40,294 --> 01:36:45,197
l'll sing a song for myself.

1412
01:37:04,552 --> 01:37:29,071
<i>TAMlLlNl</i>

1413
01:37:29,410 --> 01:37:38,842
Hereafter, the drama which we'll
play in the house will be pleasant.

1414
01:37:39,053 --> 01:37:47,518
Your eyes will search
me every where.

1415
01:37:48,062 --> 01:37:50,189
You'll find me near the stair case.

1416
01:37:50,397 --> 01:37:52,695
You'll act as though,
you haven't seen me.

1417
01:37:53,167 --> 01:37:55,135
You'll embrace me.

1418
01:37:55,336 --> 01:37:57,702
You'll hug me in the
middle of the stair case.

1419
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:02,539
Fear will beget fear &
it'll vanish.

1420
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:06,710
Shyness will feel shy &
vanish.

1421
01:39:22,323 --> 01:39:31,459
You'll prepare lunch by yourself
on Sunday afternoons.

1422
01:39:31,832 --> 01:39:40,467
You'll ask me to watch
the fun & wash my clothes.

1423
01:39:40,841 --> 01:39:43,139
The entire town is afraid of you.

1424
01:39:43,344 --> 01:39:45,642
But, you behave like a child with me.

1425
01:39:46,013 --> 01:39:47,981
l'll feel proud of me.

1426
01:39:48,182 --> 01:39:50,480
We both are made for each other!

1427
01:39:51,185 --> 01:39:54,985
My heart is drenched with happiness.

1428
01:39:55,356 --> 01:39:59,486
My world will blossom.

1429
01:40:49,576 --> 01:40:51,373
There's no inter-caste anomaly.

1430
01:40:51,578 --> 01:40:53,375
There's no inter-caste anomaly.

1431
01:40:53,747 --> 01:40:55,715
Sir, read `Konar Tamil'.

1432
01:40:55,916 --> 01:40:56,883
l ate at `Devar's mess.

1433
01:40:57,084 --> 01:40:58,051
l had tea in a `Nair's shop'.

1434
01:40:58,252 --> 01:40:59,378
l bought provisions
from Nadar's shop.

1435
01:40:59,586 --> 01:41:00,883
l borrowed money from
chettiar's house.

1436
01:41:01,088 --> 01:41:03,113
Sir, how can we believe that
there's no caste system .

1437
01:41:04,258 --> 01:41:05,987
Wow, he has put me in a fix.

1438
01:41:06,193 --> 01:41:07,888
Sir...Greetings sir...

1439
01:41:08,095 --> 01:41:08,720
What do you want, man?

1440
01:41:08,929 --> 01:41:12,330
My son is a good student.
but they aren't admitting him in the school.

1441
01:41:12,599 --> 01:41:13,896
Aren't they?

1442
01:41:14,268 --> 01:41:15,895
Sir, greetings... - Greetings.

1443
01:41:16,103 --> 01:41:18,071
This boy is from a poor family
but studies well.

1444
01:41:18,272 --> 01:41:19,068
Give him a seat.

1445
01:41:19,273 --> 01:41:21,070
l can't give him admission in
a convent school. - Why?

1446
01:41:21,275 --> 01:41:22,173
His parents are uneducated.

1447
01:41:22,376 --> 01:41:24,469
Then, do one thing.
First give admission to the parents.

1448
01:41:24,711 --> 01:41:26,906
Let them obtain their degrees.
Then admit him.

1449
01:41:27,114 --> 01:41:28,741
Priest what're you blabbering?

1450
01:41:28,949 --> 01:41:29,574
l'm not blabbering, this child
is going to study.

1451
01:41:29,783 --> 01:41:31,080
His parent's age is around 40.

1452
01:41:31,285 --> 01:41:32,343
How will they study now?

1453
01:41:32,553 --> 01:41:34,680
lf parents are educated, only then
they can teach their children.

1454
01:41:34,888 --> 01:41:38,085
Then, why're you here working as
a teacher? - Come here.

1455
01:41:38,292 --> 01:41:40,419
What's it? - Here, you've to give
donation to get admission.

1456
01:41:40,627 --> 01:41:42,595
Okay, you get it from
those who have.

1457
01:41:42,796 --> 01:41:45,264
He's poor, but he studies well...
Give him a seat.

1458
01:41:45,466 --> 01:41:46,933
What is he going to
do after studying?

1459
01:41:47,468 --> 01:41:49,936
Children's education will uplift lndia.

1460
01:41:50,137 --> 01:41:52,367
So said by Dr.Abdul Kalam whose
photo you've hung on the wall.

1461
01:41:52,573 --> 01:41:54,438
And you're refusing to give education
to a poor student.

1462
01:41:54,641 --> 01:41:55,608
ls it not injustice?

1463
01:41:55,809 --> 01:41:58,334
They all belongs to
cloth less caste.

1464
01:41:58,745 --> 01:42:01,612
So, clothes is the criteria, isn't it?.
- Yes.

1465
01:42:01,815 --> 01:42:03,442
l'll solve it now itself.

1466
01:42:09,156 --> 01:42:10,623
Hands up, boy...

1467
01:42:10,824 --> 01:42:12,291
Why does a chair need a cloth?

1468
01:42:12,493 --> 01:42:14,222
You need a shirt.

1469
01:42:15,996 --> 01:42:17,964
He has a shirt.
Give him a seat now.

1470
01:42:18,165 --> 01:42:20,963
ls shirt alone enough?
- Then, do you want pant also?

1471
01:42:21,168 --> 01:42:23,636
ls this okay for a pant?
- Oh God...l'll give him a seat.

1472
01:42:25,339 --> 01:42:25,805
Take him.

1473
01:42:26,173 --> 01:42:28,141
Sir, did my son get admission?

1474
01:42:28,342 --> 01:42:30,310
He got a seat & shirt also.

1475
01:42:30,511 --> 01:42:31,637
How did you wangle it?

1476
01:42:32,513 --> 01:42:33,912
l told the truth.

1477
01:42:35,516 --> 01:42:37,313
On January 12th,

1478
01:42:37,518 --> 01:42:40,817
The opposition party badmouthed
the ruling party leader.

1479
01:42:41,021 --> 01:42:44,980
So, the ruling party has decided to go
for one day's strike in the city.

1480
01:42:45,192 --> 01:42:50,824
Hey, it's a bandh of our party.
No one should come out.

1481
01:42:51,198 --> 01:42:53,325
Even tea or petty shops
shouldn't open.

1482
01:42:53,534 --> 01:42:55,832
lnform our henchmen in
all the areas. - Yes boss.

1483
01:42:56,203 --> 01:42:58,330
Sir, if there's bandh before `Pongal' fetival?
How will it be?

1484
01:42:58,872 --> 01:43:01,170
lt's a bandh called by the ruling party
so, close all your shops.

1485
01:43:01,375 --> 01:43:03,843
Government is not supporting it.
lt's ruling party's Bandh.

1486
01:43:04,044 --> 01:43:06,672
These are all perishable goods
we can't store them.

1487
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:10,839
We've bought goods
on high interest rates.

1488
01:43:11,051 --> 01:43:12,348
Sir, if you insist like this
what can we do?

1489
01:43:12,886 --> 01:43:15,514
lf we close our shops,
business will suffer a great loss.

1490
01:43:15,722 --> 01:43:18,691
Okay, you all sign on a paper
demanding protection.

1491
01:43:18,892 --> 01:43:20,860
l'll see to rest of the things.
- Thank you very much, sir.

1492
01:43:22,563 --> 01:43:24,793
Sir Annachi is involved
in this affair.

1493
01:43:25,065 --> 01:43:26,191
Do we've to interfere in this?

1494
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:29,528
All hard workers are
suffering a lot.

1495
01:43:29,903 --> 01:43:31,200
Forget about that man...

1496
01:43:38,579 --> 01:43:40,206
Sir, who's on duty in Palayamkottai?
- Kumarasamy.

1497
01:43:40,414 --> 01:43:42,211
Whoever creates problem,
put him in jail. - Okay sir.

1498
01:43:48,589 --> 01:43:50,887
We learnt about today's Bandh
only from the newspaper.

1499
01:43:56,263 --> 01:43:58,891
Sir, as you had said, l've given
security to the entire state.

1500
01:43:59,099 --> 01:44:00,726
Not only here, there won't be
any problem at any place.

1501
01:44:08,775 --> 01:44:11,073
Police chases & beats the rowdies.

1502
01:44:11,278 --> 01:44:13,746
Till Saamy sir is there,
l can bravely open the shop.

1503
01:44:23,123 --> 01:44:24,920
Thank you, sir... Long live, sir...

1504
01:44:42,909 --> 01:44:46,606
Hello, who's it? Annachi has gone out.

1505
01:44:47,147 --> 01:44:48,774
Put down your phone..

1506
01:44:49,149 --> 01:44:51,549
Saamy is not a human being.
Truly, he's a God.

1507
01:44:51,752 --> 01:44:52,514
Very good, Paramasivam...

1508
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:54,448
You're protecting the Public
against ruling Party's bandh.

1509
01:44:54,655 --> 01:44:55,622
Whether it's ruling
or opposition Party.

1510
01:44:55,822 --> 01:44:56,789
l'll give importance to the Public.

1511
01:44:57,157 --> 01:44:59,455
lf he wasn't there, we couldn't
have run the business.

1512
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:02,629
They've won & we've lost.

1513
01:45:02,829 --> 01:45:05,389
Bandh announced by ruling Party
passed off peacefully.

1514
01:45:05,832 --> 01:45:08,960
Except in Tirunelveli, there was no
disturbance in daily routines.

1515
01:45:09,169 --> 01:45:12,730
All the shops were open.
There were no untoward incidents.

1516
01:45:12,939 --> 01:45:14,634
Start the car.

1517
01:45:14,841 --> 01:45:17,469
Annachi, don't be in a hurry.
Everything is over.

1518
01:45:17,678 --> 01:45:18,474
Now, if you hit him...

1519
01:45:18,679 --> 01:45:20,306
He's a cheat. l didn't refer to him.

1520
01:45:21,181 --> 01:45:24,480
How dare businessmen
open their shops?

1521
01:45:24,685 --> 01:45:26,482
lt's all because of
that Saamy's support.

1522
01:45:26,687 --> 01:45:28,985
They know what'll happen if
they act against Annachi.

1523
01:45:29,189 --> 01:45:31,657
Annachi, coming Friday,
Saamy is going to get married.

1524
01:45:32,025 --> 01:45:34,152
At that time, all Police men will
be in the marriage hall.

1525
01:45:34,528 --> 01:45:36,996
On that day, let's show the
businessmen our true colour.

1526
01:45:37,197 --> 01:45:39,165
Their corpses should be
telecast in the T.V.

1527
01:45:40,367 --> 01:45:42,164
On Bogi festival, people burn all the rubbish,

1528
01:45:42,369 --> 01:45:46,169
And create pollution generating
Carbon-monoxide & dioxide.

1529
01:45:46,373 --> 01:45:48,841
People have already created a hole
in the Ozone layer.

1530
01:45:49,042 --> 01:45:51,010
Don't know where they are going
to create more holes.

1531
01:45:51,378 --> 01:45:53,346
Aunt, stop.

1532
01:45:53,714 --> 01:45:55,181
lt seems Uncle sleeps on this mat.

1533
01:45:55,382 --> 01:45:56,508
Are you going to put it in the fire?

1534
01:45:56,717 --> 01:45:58,116
lt has become old.
- Do you mean Uncle?

1535
01:45:58,385 --> 01:45:58,851
Shut up!

1536
01:45:59,052 --> 01:46:01,850
lf you give it to people who don't
have mat, they can sleep on it. Give it to me.

1537
01:46:02,089 --> 01:46:04,057
Shut up & get lost.

1538
01:46:04,224 --> 01:46:06,692
Uncle, please stop. What're you
putting in the fire.

1539
01:46:06,893 --> 01:46:07,689
Old clothes.

1540
01:46:07,894 --> 01:46:09,953
They may be old for you,
but they're new for them.

1541
01:46:10,163 --> 01:46:12,688
lf you give them they'll wear them.
- lt's good to burn old things.

1542
01:46:13,066 --> 01:46:15,534
The proverb says ''Discard old things &
accept the new ones''.

1543
01:46:16,002 --> 01:46:17,196
That is what Bogi festival is for, isn't it?

1544
01:46:18,405 --> 01:46:21,636
So, anything which is old can
be put in the fire, isn't it? - Sure.

1545
01:46:25,912 --> 01:46:27,209
Hey, what're you doing?

1546
01:46:27,414 --> 01:46:29,882
This is the oldest thing
in the entire District.

1547
01:46:30,083 --> 01:46:31,710
l'm going to put this in the fire.

1548
01:46:32,085 --> 01:46:33,552
And enjoy Bogi festival.

1549
01:46:34,755 --> 01:46:36,723
Hey, don't harm him. - Why?

1550
01:46:36,923 --> 01:46:37,719
He's my brother.

1551
01:46:37,924 --> 01:46:39,653
Let him be your brother or anyone.

1552
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:41,885
First keep the clothes down.

1553
01:46:42,262 --> 01:46:44,890
Only then, l won't put him
in the fire. - Get lost.

1554
01:46:45,265 --> 01:46:46,027
Children, take the clothes.

1555
01:46:48,602 --> 01:46:51,730
Thanks Uncle.
- l used you for a good cause.

1556
01:46:52,105 --> 01:46:54,164
Don't be afraid. l won't put you
in the fire.

1557
01:46:54,374 --> 01:46:58,071
Come. Let's go to your house &
have a cup of coffee. come..

1558
01:46:58,712 --> 01:46:59,736
Open your eyes.

1559
01:47:02,282 --> 01:47:05,843
Hey, it's been 2 days since he died.

1560
01:47:06,052 --> 01:47:08,680
And you're celebrating
Bogi festival!

1561
01:47:09,055 --> 01:47:10,750
You shouldn't celebrate
even Pongal festival which comes later..

1562
01:47:17,130 --> 01:47:17,755
Stop it!

1563
01:47:18,131 --> 01:47:20,031
How long will you be playing
the same music?

1564
01:47:20,233 --> 01:47:23,259
Beat the drum in the modern trend.

1565
01:47:26,473 --> 01:47:29,704
Come.. come.. You must eat & go.

1566
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:30,774
My stomach is upset.

1567
01:47:30,977 --> 01:47:33,275
Then, eat & discard your waste
in a corner.

1568
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:35,778
Stupid! Doesn't know what to
talk in a marriage.

1569
01:47:47,994 --> 01:47:49,621
Hey, leave me... leave me..

1570
01:48:01,842 --> 01:48:03,639
Hey, why're you doing like this?

1571
01:48:03,844 --> 01:48:05,471
How dare you defy our boss &
open the shop?

1572
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:41,047
Beat the drum.

1573
01:48:46,753 --> 01:48:49,881
Sir.. sir..

1574
01:48:50,257 --> 01:48:53,556
Annachi's henchmen are destroying shops
in the market. - You sit down.

1575
01:48:53,927 --> 01:48:55,792
They've killed the shopkeepers.

1576
01:48:55,996 --> 01:48:58,726
Not only that, they've hacked
4 policemen too.

1577
01:48:58,932 --> 01:49:01,560
They're hitting women & children too.

1578
01:49:01,768 --> 01:49:03,133
Come & see there. - Come.

1579
01:49:07,941 --> 01:49:09,408
Sir... sir... Did you see this?

1580
01:49:09,609 --> 01:49:11,668
We've lost all our goods.

1581
01:49:11,878 --> 01:49:14,438
Look, they've killed our men.

1582
01:49:20,453 --> 01:49:23,251
Sir, we opened our shops because you
told us to open them.

1583
01:49:23,623 --> 01:49:25,921
Look, what Annachi's men have
done to us?

1584
01:49:26,726 --> 01:49:29,422
Look there, they've destroyed
all the shops.

1585
01:49:32,065 --> 01:49:35,592
He was in the market.
They killed him & went away.

1586
01:49:35,802 --> 01:49:38,100
l don't know what to do.
l'm clueless.

1587
01:49:38,305 --> 01:49:43,607
Did you see? Look how brutal they are.

1588
01:49:45,478 --> 01:49:48,447
We opened our shops because
you told us to open them.

1589
01:49:48,815 --> 01:49:51,113
Scoundrels, they've killed our men.

1590
01:49:51,651 --> 01:49:56,281
Look at this brutality!
What crime have we committed?

1591
01:49:57,157 --> 01:49:59,284
Why should we suffer like this?

1592
01:49:59,492 --> 01:50:02,290
Stop madam.. stop..

1593
01:50:03,663 --> 01:50:04,721
Look at this brutality.

1594
01:50:05,332 --> 01:50:06,799
They all opened the shops because we
told them to open.

1595
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,297
What should we do with Annachi?

1596
01:50:08,501 --> 01:50:09,798
What're we going to do for them?

1597
01:50:25,185 --> 01:50:25,810
Stop sir.

1598
01:50:29,122 --> 01:50:30,487
Come Saamy.

1599
01:50:30,857 --> 01:50:33,826
Have you come to get my blessings
after marriage.

1600
01:50:34,527 --> 01:50:35,824
Where's your wife?

1601
01:50:36,363 --> 01:50:36,988
Hey stop!

1602
01:50:37,197 --> 01:50:39,995
Hey, do you know the value of life?

1603
01:50:40,867 --> 01:50:43,768
Since your name is Saamy(God), did you
think you're God of this City?

1604
01:50:45,271 --> 01:50:47,831
Who permitted you to give them
Police protection?

1605
01:50:48,041 --> 01:50:49,838
Whom do l have to ask?
- You must ask me.

1606
01:50:50,043 --> 01:50:51,305
Are you the Collector or
the Government?

1607
01:50:51,511 --> 01:50:52,671
l'm more than that.

1608
01:50:53,713 --> 01:50:59,515
With Rs.13,000 salary, 2 sets
of uniforms & a pair of shoes,

1609
01:50:59,886 --> 01:51:02,855
Controlling 4 police stations
& 40 police men,

1610
01:51:03,056 --> 01:51:05,854
You've so much of arrogance?

1611
01:51:06,393 --> 01:51:10,193
l control 8 districts,
92 MLA's & 16 MP's,

1612
01:51:10,397 --> 01:51:15,198
And l control the Government.
How arrogant l should be?

1613
01:51:15,402 --> 01:51:18,701
Hey, l read 20 Newspapers a day.

1614
01:51:19,072 --> 01:51:21,540
Do you think it's easy to
indulge in Politics?

1615
01:51:21,741 --> 01:51:26,041
My high command is continuously
seeking information about the strike.

1616
01:51:26,246 --> 01:51:27,713
Will you answer them?

1617
01:51:29,582 --> 01:51:32,710
l don't have any value
for lives.

1618
01:51:32,919 --> 01:51:37,720
You made me lose my honour.
So, l took revenge.

1619
01:51:39,259 --> 01:51:40,055
lf you wanted to take revenge,

1620
01:51:40,260 --> 01:51:41,955
You must've fought with me for
giving them protection.

1621
01:51:42,929 --> 01:51:45,056
But you've killed innocent
businessmen.

1622
01:51:45,265 --> 01:51:47,733
You've broken the heads of women
& children too.

1623
01:51:47,934 --> 01:51:49,902
2 Policemen have died.
Who'll answer their families?

1624
01:51:50,670 --> 01:51:53,002
You people get salaries to die.

1625
01:51:53,206 --> 01:51:56,232
You're proud that you're part of
the fighting force, aren't you?

1626
01:51:56,609 --> 01:51:57,906
You must die when it
comes to fight.

1627
01:51:58,111 --> 01:52:01,239
Hey, we'll compensate for the
lost lives & damaged shops.

1628
01:52:01,448 --> 01:52:03,746
You Police dogs will wag your tail
if we give you bribes,

1629
01:52:03,950 --> 01:52:05,076
Or else you'll bark at us.

1630
01:52:05,285 --> 01:52:08,743
l don't bark, l bite!

1631
01:52:09,622 --> 01:52:12,750
l would've cut your throat on the day you
entered my house without permission.

1632
01:52:13,626 --> 01:52:16,925
l spared you because it could've
ruined a girl's life. Shit!

1633
01:52:17,697 --> 01:52:19,426
Since l didn't want the public
to be agitated,

1634
01:52:19,632 --> 01:52:21,429
l accepted money from you.

1635
01:52:21,634 --> 01:52:22,601
But now they're agitated.

1636
01:52:23,470 --> 01:52:25,097
You've showed your arrogance.

1637
01:52:25,638 --> 01:52:27,606
From now on, l'll show how
arrogant l can be.

1638
01:52:27,974 --> 01:52:28,599
What did you say?

1639
01:52:29,142 --> 01:52:32,942
l'll destroy your 92 MLA's,16 MP's,
4 Ministers, 40 Cars, 30 Jeeps,

1640
01:52:33,146 --> 01:52:34,443
And your title, Kingmaker.

1641
01:52:34,647 --> 01:52:37,775
lf l don't make you a beggar
& make you beg on the streets,

1642
01:52:39,652 --> 01:52:41,449
l'll change my name.

1643
01:52:41,988 --> 01:52:43,455
Only if l leave you till then...

1644
01:52:44,324 --> 01:52:45,120
Take it.

1645
01:52:45,992 --> 01:52:46,788
Transfer order!

1646
01:52:47,327 --> 01:52:49,295
Keep this as my gift for
your marriage.

1647
01:52:50,663 --> 01:52:52,631
You've to shift to another
City in 7 days.

1648
01:52:52,832 --> 01:52:54,800
Go & pack your luggage.

1649
01:52:59,172 --> 01:53:01,140
l can kill you
this second itself.

1650
01:53:02,842 --> 01:53:07,643
l'll kill you & perform your obsequies
within a week's time which you've given me.

1651
01:53:11,017 --> 01:53:12,314
Hey, Perumal Pitchai!

1652
01:53:13,353 --> 01:53:17,483
On the 7th day when l leave this City,
You'll not be in this City.

1653
01:53:27,033 --> 01:53:27,499
Thank God!

1654
01:53:31,371 --> 01:53:34,499
What happened? There wasn't any
problem, isn't it? - No dad.

1655
01:53:38,545 --> 01:53:39,512
Go inside.

1656
01:53:41,381 --> 01:53:44,407
Are you angry with me?
- No, my time isn't good,

1657
01:53:45,385 --> 01:53:46,682
That's why such things are
happening to you.

1658
01:53:46,886 --> 01:53:47,853
No, you mad girl.

1659
01:53:49,055 --> 01:53:51,853
All these days, l was feeling bad
for accepting money from a rogue.

1660
01:53:53,059 --> 01:53:55,687
The moment you came, into my life,
everything is coming to an end.

1661
01:54:00,233 --> 01:54:04,192
Venkatrama... - Yes.
- Come here.

1662
01:54:04,404 --> 01:54:05,371
No Uncle, l've some work
in this house.

1663
01:54:05,572 --> 01:54:07,039
Just come & have some water.

1664
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:08,366
No Uncle, l might create problems
if l come there.

1665
01:54:08,575 --> 01:54:10,873
There won't be any problem.
l've forgotten the earlier incident.

1666
01:54:11,077 --> 01:54:13,045
Come & sit. Mangalam, get him a
glass of water.

1667
01:54:13,246 --> 01:54:14,543
Who's Mangalam?
ls she your wife?

1668
01:54:14,747 --> 01:54:17,215
She's just a maid servant.
Sometimes, she'll be my wife.

1669
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:18,216
Have it.

1670
01:54:19,185 --> 01:54:20,550
How come this vessel is damaged more?

1671
01:54:20,753 --> 01:54:21,481
Go inside.

1672
01:54:22,021 --> 01:54:24,216
Who's this boy, studying?
- He's my son.

1673
01:54:24,424 --> 01:54:25,721
He'll go to U.S. in a few days.

1674
01:54:25,925 --> 01:54:27,950
Do you mean Uzhavar Sandhai
(Farmers Market). - No, United States.

1675
01:54:28,761 --> 01:54:31,059
Who's this boy, polishing the shoes?
- He is....

1676
01:54:31,264 --> 01:54:33,232
He'll clean my son's shoes till
he completes his schooling.

1677
01:54:33,433 --> 01:54:33,990
After that,

1678
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:35,724
He'll clean my shoes till
l retire from my Office.

1679
01:54:35,935 --> 01:54:37,402
After that, will he
clean Aunt's shoes?

1680
01:54:38,605 --> 01:54:41,403
Both are of the same age.
Why don't you educate him also?

1681
01:54:41,608 --> 01:54:43,405
lf l educate him, then who'll work?

1682
01:54:43,610 --> 01:54:45,976
This is the land of Kamarajar,
who wanted everyone to get educated.

1683
01:54:46,179 --> 01:54:50,240
And Pasumpon, who, generously,
gave his wealth to others.

1684
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:53,419
How can you make a small boy work?
This is Child Labour.

1685
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:57,249
Hey, he'll study, he'll clean,
they're destined like that.

1686
01:54:57,957 --> 01:54:58,685
Hey, get up.

1687
01:54:59,392 --> 01:55:02,259
l'll educate you.
What do you want to study?

1688
01:55:02,462 --> 01:55:03,759
Law. - Law?

1689
01:55:04,297 --> 01:55:08,427
You scoundrel! You've made a future
Legal luminary to clean your shoes.

1690
01:55:08,635 --> 01:55:12,435
Which Law do you like to study?
Civil Law, Criminal Law or Company Law.

1691
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:14,266
SHAKEELAW! - SHAKEELAW?

1692
01:55:17,310 --> 01:55:20,370
You've ruined him by allowing him to
watch ''Midnight Masala'' along with you.

1693
01:55:22,248 --> 01:55:23,112
Who were responsible for the
violence that broke out?

1694
01:55:23,316 --> 01:55:24,783
Annachi's 4 important men.

1695
01:55:25,151 --> 01:55:28,279
They're every thing to him.

1696
01:55:28,488 --> 01:55:31,184
lf you ask them to do something,
they'll always exceed their brief.

1697
01:55:32,325 --> 01:55:34,953
The affected people are stronger,
than the predators.

1698
01:55:35,495 --> 01:55:37,292
l'll tear them into pieces.

1699
01:55:37,497 --> 01:55:38,794
But you all must be with me.

1700
01:55:39,165 --> 01:55:41,463
Destroy all his wine shops,
brothel houses,

1701
01:55:41,668 --> 01:55:44,296
And his illegal breweries
in all the districts.

1702
01:55:44,504 --> 01:55:47,473
There'll be problem. l'll arrest
them & subsequently release you.

1703
01:55:48,274 --> 01:55:53,473
Seize all unlicenced buses, lorries and
close down all his illegal bars.

1704
01:55:57,183 --> 01:55:58,309
No..no...seize it.

1705
01:55:58,518 --> 01:55:59,985
Okay sir! we won't spare any one.

1706
01:56:03,856 --> 01:56:04,652
Go & check inside.

1707
01:56:05,525 --> 01:56:05,991
Take it.

1708
01:56:06,526 --> 01:56:08,426
Don't talk.
Take the bus to the station.

1709
01:56:10,196 --> 01:56:11,322
Take the bus to the station.

1710
01:56:19,539 --> 01:56:22,007
No sir, don't beat us.
- Seize all lorries.

1711
01:56:22,875 --> 01:56:25,002
This is Annachi's Sand quarry.
Don't create any problem unnecessarily.

1712
01:57:15,261 --> 01:57:16,228
Hey, stop it.

1713
01:57:16,596 --> 01:57:17,392
Why're you taking photographs?

1714
01:57:17,597 --> 01:57:18,894
We've to give this news to
the evening newspapers.

1715
01:57:19,098 --> 01:57:20,895
And we also need it for our records.
- As if he has come to pose...

1716
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:23,395
Hey, if you want to take photographs
of all those who commit crimes,

1717
01:57:23,603 --> 01:57:24,661
Then, there'll be no one
left in Tamil Nadu.

1718
01:57:24,937 --> 01:57:26,564
Why do you publicize such
matters in newspapers,

1719
01:57:26,773 --> 01:57:28,570
And torture them mentally who're
already physically tortured?

1720
01:57:28,775 --> 01:57:30,572
You all can go... go...

1721
01:57:30,777 --> 01:57:31,744
You don't even have a moustache...

1722
01:57:31,944 --> 01:57:36,313
Sir, people who arrest us,
have a fling at us the next day.

1723
01:57:36,682 --> 01:57:38,673
But amongst them, you're the only
one who is so concerned about us.

1724
01:57:39,285 --> 01:57:40,582
Thank you very much, sir.
- Okay, go.

1725
01:57:45,558 --> 01:57:46,422
Paramasivam... - Sir.

1726
01:57:49,062 --> 01:57:51,257
Why're you seizing Annachi's lorries
and closing down wine shops?

1727
01:57:51,464 --> 01:57:52,931
All those shops don't have licenses.

1728
01:57:53,466 --> 01:57:54,524
All those lorries are
without permit.

1729
01:57:54,801 --> 01:57:55,995
l'm following the rules.

1730
01:57:57,470 --> 01:58:01,668
l feel ashamed to face Annachi.

1731
01:58:02,308 --> 01:58:04,367
He'll spit on us if we go now.

1732
01:58:04,877 --> 01:58:08,108
He has seized all our lorries,
closed down our shops & lodges.

1733
01:58:08,314 --> 01:58:10,441
He has sprouted just now.

1734
01:58:10,650 --> 01:58:12,117
Look, how he's wagging his tail.

1735
01:58:12,318 --> 01:58:14,445
Annachi made us MLAs.

1736
01:58:14,987 --> 01:58:16,454
Since we live at Annachi's mercy,

1737
01:58:17,490 --> 01:58:18,957
We must put him in jail.

1738
01:58:19,158 --> 01:58:20,785
Earlier, they used to give
free tea & money too.

1739
01:58:20,993 --> 01:58:23,291
Now, they're taking money before
supplying a tea, after your arrival.

1740
01:58:23,496 --> 01:58:24,622
l can make out from
your large girth.

1741
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,968
Do you consider yourself
a great police man?

1742
01:58:30,036 --> 01:58:33,597
lt seems, you'll take action against us.
Are you trying to threaten us?

1743
01:58:34,674 --> 01:58:36,642
Answer me, l'm asking you.

1744
01:58:36,843 --> 01:58:38,140
l consider it below my dignity
to talk to you.

1745
01:58:38,344 --> 01:58:39,641
What's so cheap about me?

1746
01:58:39,846 --> 01:58:45,478
l've the right to ask you and
dismiss you.

1747
01:58:45,685 --> 01:58:47,812
Go away silently.
l'm very angry with you.

1748
01:58:48,020 --> 01:58:50,147
Even my men are itching
to kill you.

1749
01:58:50,356 --> 01:58:53,154
One hint is enough
& they'll finish you.

1750
01:58:53,359 --> 01:58:54,986
Don't over stretch it, brother.
Just go away.

1751
01:58:55,194 --> 01:58:56,491
Why're you calling me brother?

1752
01:58:56,696 --> 01:58:58,994
Look at that head constable,
he's elder to me.

1753
01:58:59,198 --> 01:59:00,165
But, he's calling me sir.

1754
01:59:00,867 --> 01:59:09,832
Sometimes, we've to call, brother
sir, rowdy, rogue, pimp, idiot, fool etc.,

1755
01:59:12,044 --> 01:59:13,238
We were waiting for
this opportunity.

1756
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:15,177
Hey, how dare you think of arresting
our MLA. - Arrest him.

1757
01:59:15,381 --> 01:59:17,849
Okay sir. - Yes sir.
- l'm a ruling party MLA.

1758
01:59:18,050 --> 01:59:19,847
l'll show you the consequences of
holding a police man's collar.

1759
01:59:20,052 --> 01:59:23,021
How dare you arrest me?
l'll see you later.

1760
01:59:23,222 --> 01:59:26,020
How dare you arrest
this lR-8 Sundaram?

1761
01:59:26,225 --> 01:59:28,693
lt's lR-30.
You've kept a wrong name.

1762
01:59:28,895 --> 01:59:31,864
l should've arrested you in just an
underwear & beaten you on the road.

1763
01:59:32,064 --> 01:59:34,692
l don't want to insult 67,500
people who had voted for you.

1764
01:59:34,901 --> 01:59:36,368
So, l'm taking you in a jeep.

1765
01:59:36,569 --> 01:59:38,196
Call the Commissioner.

1766
01:59:44,744 --> 01:59:45,540
Mr.Saamy! - Sir.

1767
01:59:45,745 --> 01:59:46,803
What's this? What's happening?

1768
01:59:47,079 --> 01:59:50,879
You've arrested an MLA on the road.
Why did you arrest him?

1769
01:59:51,083 --> 01:59:52,710
Last night he raped a woman.

1770
01:59:53,085 --> 01:59:55,053
l called him with all due
respects for enquiry.

1771
01:59:55,254 --> 01:59:57,154
He pulled me by my shirt.
l've proof for that.

1772
01:59:58,424 --> 02:00:01,052
What? Did l rape?
Where's the evidence?

1773
02:00:01,260 --> 02:00:02,557
l've a written complaint
from that woman.

1774
02:00:02,762 --> 02:00:06,220
Anyone can write a complaint
if they've a paper & pen.

1775
02:00:06,432 --> 02:00:07,228
Who's that woman?

1776
02:00:24,450 --> 02:00:26,077
Okay, you can proceed.
- Yes sir.

1777
02:00:28,454 --> 02:00:31,184
You once said, ''The girl was chubby
and beautiful, so he raped her.''

1778
02:00:31,791 --> 02:00:33,258
Look, l've arrested you for rape
without you raping anyone.

1779
02:00:33,459 --> 02:00:34,858
This is Saamy style.

1780
02:00:38,130 --> 02:00:38,926
Thanks Madam.

1781
02:00:41,133 --> 02:00:44,660
Annachi, Saamy has arrested
MLA lR-8 Sundaram also.

1782
02:00:53,980 --> 02:00:54,674
Oh my God!

1783
02:01:01,487 --> 02:01:02,215
Oh my God!

1784
02:01:03,823 --> 02:01:05,791
Dear. - Go away, don't disturb me.

1785
02:01:05,992 --> 02:01:07,960
All my clothes in the bureau
and box are missing.

1786
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:10,628
Will a thief dare to enter a police
man's house? Search properly.

1787
02:01:10,830 --> 02:01:12,297
l've searched properly.
Everything is missing.

1788
02:01:12,498 --> 02:01:13,965
Even the silk sari presented
by my mother is missing.

1789
02:01:14,166 --> 02:01:18,296
Chili powder! You're inciting my desires
by coming half naked early morning.

1790
02:01:20,339 --> 02:01:20,805
What?

1791
02:01:23,009 --> 02:01:24,636
ls the thief inside the house?

1792
02:01:25,011 --> 02:01:26,137
Bloody rascal!

1793
02:01:26,512 --> 02:01:28,309
You're that 4 letter word.

1794
02:01:28,848 --> 02:01:29,974
Why're you using foul language?

1795
02:01:30,182 --> 02:01:35,313
You had only said its rotten egg
& foolish monkey.

1796
02:01:35,855 --> 02:01:37,823
That's for others.
Do you know the real meaning?

1797
02:01:38,024 --> 02:01:38,991
Dirty fellow!

1798
02:01:39,859 --> 02:01:41,986
Give me a dirty kiss.
- Dirty kiss?

1799
02:01:42,194 --> 02:01:43,991
lf we both take bath and kiss,
it's a beauty kiss.

1800
02:01:44,196 --> 02:01:45,823
lf kissed without taking bath,
it's a dirty kiss.

1801
02:01:46,032 --> 02:01:46,498
Kiss me.

1802
02:01:53,873 --> 02:01:56,273
What're you doing?

1803
02:01:56,475 --> 02:01:59,410
l've plucked out the
gray hair which l hated.

1804
02:02:01,547 --> 02:02:02,980
This is `Theft case'.

1805
02:02:03,215 --> 02:02:05,843
Paramasivam, we've got a call that a bomb
is planted in Rathna theatre.

1806
02:02:06,052 --> 02:02:07,519
We must clear it,
come quickly...quick.

1807
02:02:07,887 --> 02:02:08,512
Control room.

1808
02:02:08,721 --> 02:02:10,086
Send the bomb squad
to Rathna theatre.

1809
02:02:18,397 --> 02:02:18,863
First send everyone inside.

1810
02:02:19,065 --> 02:02:20,532
First send all the spectators out.

1811
02:02:20,733 --> 02:02:22,860
Everyone go inside,
including the bomb squad.

1812
02:02:23,069 --> 02:02:24,366
Go quickly.
- Clear out people from here.

1813
02:02:24,570 --> 02:02:25,696
Search every corner.

1814
02:02:28,741 --> 02:02:29,366
Quick...quick...

1815
02:02:29,575 --> 02:02:31,202
Send out all the people and
close the gates.

1816
02:02:34,580 --> 02:02:37,640
Search the canteen. Go...go...

1817
02:02:43,422 --> 02:02:45,549
Sir, it's 1 1 a.m. now.
Go to the court immediately.

1818
02:02:45,758 --> 02:02:46,884
Or else that MLA will
come out on bail.

1819
02:02:47,093 --> 02:02:49,220
Whatever he might do,
he'll not get a bail.

1820
02:02:49,428 --> 02:02:52,397
Judge is on our side.
He'll definitely get 15 days remand.

1821
02:02:55,434 --> 02:02:57,561
Hello. - Saamy, the bomb isn't
in the theatre.

1822
02:02:57,770 --> 02:02:59,567
What're you saying?
- lt's in the bus station.

1823
02:02:59,772 --> 02:03:01,569
Go & save the people there.
- Who are you, man?

1824
02:03:05,277 --> 02:03:07,575
Check all the buses thoroughly.
Send all the passengers out.

1825
02:03:13,953 --> 02:03:15,580
All of you, go this side...
This side.

1826
02:03:29,969 --> 02:03:33,769
Hello. - Saamy, bomb is placed under
C.T's statue opposite the court.

1827
02:03:33,973 --> 02:03:35,941
Tell everyone to get down from the bus.
Get down...Get down.

1828
02:03:38,978 --> 02:03:39,603
Come here. - Sir.

1829
02:03:39,812 --> 02:03:40,437
l've a doubt.

1830
02:03:40,646 --> 02:03:42,273
You go and search Railway station,
schools & colleges.

1831
02:03:42,481 --> 02:03:43,106
Okay sir.
- l'll go to the court.

1832
02:03:43,315 --> 02:03:43,940
Okay sir.

1833
02:03:55,161 --> 02:03:58,790
Saamy, did you come here fearing
that the bomb will go off?

1834
02:03:59,331 --> 02:04:02,129
This is not a bomb that'll
blast but it's ''Zandu Balm'' (pain killer).

1835
02:04:02,334 --> 02:04:03,130
Look, its there.

1836
02:04:07,006 --> 02:04:08,871
You would've got tired by
running all over the city.

1837
02:04:09,074 --> 02:04:10,974
Your knees must be paining,
use the pain balm.

1838
02:04:14,346 --> 02:04:15,142
Why're you staring at me?

1839
02:04:15,347 --> 02:04:19,147
l stopped you from going to
court to attend MLA's case.

1840
02:04:20,252 --> 02:04:21,480
Go away coolly from here.

1841
02:04:21,687 --> 02:04:24,315
Next time instead of ''Zandu Balm'',
it'll be gelatin bomb.

1842
02:04:26,358 --> 02:04:26,824
Sir.

1843
02:04:27,026 --> 02:04:29,551
Mr.Saamy, what do you
think of yourself?

1844
02:04:29,762 --> 02:04:31,821
You're going all over the city
with police & bomb squad.

1845
02:04:32,031 --> 02:04:33,828
And creating nuisance to the public.

1846
02:04:34,033 --> 02:04:35,330
Sir, a phone call...

1847
02:04:36,035 --> 02:04:38,503
Believing an anonymous
phone call you've...

1848
02:04:38,704 --> 02:04:39,500
What nonsense is this?

1849
02:04:39,705 --> 02:04:41,434
Stop everything and come to
my office immediately.

1850
02:04:41,707 --> 02:04:44,505
Sir, the phone call about
a bomb is not a hoax.

1851
02:04:44,710 --> 02:04:46,177
lt's true. - What're you saying?

1852
02:04:46,378 --> 02:04:48,505
lt was found inside Athangarai MLA
Shanmugham's car.

1853
02:04:49,215 --> 02:04:50,011
What happened to the MLA?

1854
02:04:50,216 --> 02:04:54,016
Sir, l was able to save the MLA
but not his car.

1855
02:05:10,069 --> 02:05:11,468
Hey, what're you doing?

1856
02:05:29,755 --> 02:05:32,053
You're not in my hit-list. Why're you falling
into the trap?

1857
02:05:33,926 --> 02:05:35,052
l'll fix you.

1858
02:05:38,430 --> 02:05:40,625
l noticed all the 7 people keenly
while running out to clear the bomb.

1859
02:05:41,934 --> 02:05:44,903
l observed the sincerity in your swiftness
in defusing the bomb.

1860
02:05:45,771 --> 02:05:49,400
ln my fight against Annachi,
can you support me indirectly?

1861
02:05:49,608 --> 02:05:52,236
Till now, no officer had
acted against Annachi.

1862
02:05:52,778 --> 02:05:55,406
lf you're doing it,
we'll support you openly.

1863
02:05:57,449 --> 02:06:01,249
For the first time, they've called me
for an inter caste marriage.

1864
02:06:01,453 --> 02:06:02,920
l'm very happy.

1865
02:06:02,988 --> 02:06:05,582
Move! l want to see the groom & bride.
Move...move...

1866
02:06:07,626 --> 02:06:10,925
What's this? The bride looks
like a donkey.

1867
02:06:11,297 --> 02:06:13,857
Donkey is the bride.
- ls donkey the bride?

1868
02:06:14,967 --> 02:06:15,763
What's this?

1869
02:06:16,302 --> 02:06:18,429
You can have marriage
between different castes.

1870
02:06:18,637 --> 02:06:20,264
lnter-religion marriages
are also acceptable.

1871
02:06:20,472 --> 02:06:24,431
But you've become too modern
by marrying a donkey.

1872
02:06:24,643 --> 02:06:25,610
There is no rain for
the past 2 years.

1873
02:06:25,811 --> 02:06:28,439
According to a tradition, if anyone
marries a donkey, a chameleon or a frog.

1874
02:06:28,647 --> 02:06:29,443
lt'll rain, won't it?

1875
02:06:30,149 --> 02:06:33,778
Why don't you marry a lion?
- lt'll eat me alive.

1876
02:06:33,986 --> 02:06:34,953
You know that, don't you?

1877
02:06:35,154 --> 02:06:37,622
Why're you still superstitious?

1878
02:06:38,157 --> 02:06:39,624
You're breaking a coconut
on tonsured head.

1879
02:06:39,825 --> 02:06:42,293
lf it bleeds, you'll call it
as wrath of God.

1880
02:06:42,494 --> 02:06:46,294
You're offering goat, hen, pig, buffalo
& everything other than man.

1881
02:06:46,498 --> 02:06:48,466
Then you eat everything.
What's all this?

1882
02:06:48,667 --> 02:06:51,227
You had taken the advance
to conduct the marriage.

1883
02:06:52,338 --> 02:06:53,635
Never let go an opportunity
to threaten people.

1884
02:06:54,506 --> 02:06:56,474
Take this auspicious thread and
tie the knot. - Recite the hymns.

1885
02:06:57,009 --> 02:06:57,634
Hymn?

1886
02:07:03,515 --> 02:07:04,709
Stop it. This isn't a hymn.

1887
02:07:05,517 --> 02:07:08,486
This hymn is enough for
donkey's marriage.

1888
02:07:08,687 --> 02:07:09,654
Tie the auspicious thread.

1889
02:07:09,855 --> 02:07:13,985
My grandson is coming
majestically like a lion.

1890
02:07:14,193 --> 02:07:17,253
Anyone crossing swords with him
will not be able to bear his kick.

1891
02:07:22,534 --> 02:07:25,162
Hey, donkey got enraged and kicked
his sensitive part.

1892
02:07:26,872 --> 02:07:29,670
This donkey has become
punching donkey.

1893
02:07:29,875 --> 02:07:32,673
You all planned a marriage
of the donkey.

1894
02:07:32,878 --> 02:07:36,279
But, this donkey has made
him impotent.

1895
02:07:36,882 --> 02:07:37,678
What's this sir?

1896
02:07:37,916 --> 02:07:40,043
They're planning a protest for reservation
and presenting a memorandum.

1897
02:07:40,219 --> 02:07:41,345
You've permitted them.

1898
02:07:41,553 --> 02:07:42,679
Two MLA's are leading
the procession.

1899
02:07:42,888 --> 02:07:44,185
Minister ordered me to permit them.

1900
02:07:44,390 --> 02:07:45,516
What can l do other
than permit them?

1901
02:07:45,724 --> 02:07:47,521
You restrict yourself to
security arrangements only.

1902
02:07:48,394 --> 02:07:50,521
Sir, what happened?
- He has given them the permission.

1903
02:07:50,729 --> 02:07:52,697
Then, you don't stay here.
- What are you saying?

1904
02:07:52,898 --> 02:07:54,866
They all are very angry with you.

1905
02:07:55,401 --> 02:07:57,369
2 years ago just like this,
They planned a procession.

1906
02:07:57,569 --> 02:07:59,366
And ransacked Melapalayam
Police station.

1907
02:07:59,571 --> 02:08:01,300
Four people hacked
the lnspector to death.

1908
02:08:01,740 --> 02:08:05,039
As the procession crosses Corporation
office starting from bus station.

1909
02:08:05,577 --> 02:08:06,703
There's a petty shop
which belongs to our man.

1910
02:08:06,912 --> 02:08:08,777
Soda water bottles will be
supplied from there.

1911
02:08:09,081 --> 02:08:10,378
That's their first weapon.

1912
02:08:10,582 --> 02:08:12,049
Further up from there,
it's ''Kandappa lathe works.''

1913
02:08:12,251 --> 02:08:13,548
We'll get sickles from there.

1914
02:08:13,752 --> 02:08:15,879
They'll try to attack us as soon as
they get hold of the weapons.

1915
02:08:16,088 --> 02:08:19,057
Since the Collector is out of station,
they'll not get firing orders.

1916
02:08:19,258 --> 02:08:22,227
They'll cross their limits thinking
that we'll not get firing orders.

1917
02:08:22,428 --> 02:08:23,224
l'll take care of that.

1918
02:08:23,429 --> 02:08:25,397
As procession nears the police station,
...clashes must break out.

1919
02:08:25,497 --> 02:08:28,295
ln that, police station and
Saamy, both must be annihilated.

1920
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:31,330
Files which we can't be closed legally
must be closed illegally.

1921
02:08:31,603 --> 02:08:33,730
Sir, you're saying that....
- You'll understand.

1922
02:08:34,606 --> 02:08:35,903
Another very important thing.

1923
02:08:36,775 --> 02:08:39,573
No pressmen must photograph the event.
Even if they manage,

1924
02:08:39,778 --> 02:08:41,336
Only smoke must be seen in
those photos, okay?

1925
02:08:43,282 --> 02:08:45,409
We'll be in trouble only if they
cross corporation office.

1926
02:08:46,618 --> 02:08:47,414
They'll never cross it.

1927
02:08:47,619 --> 02:08:53,751
ls this strength enough
or do you want more?

1928
02:08:53,959 --> 02:08:56,757
How dare you challenge our Boss?

1929
02:08:56,962 --> 02:09:00,420
We'll fight till we get justice.

1930
02:09:00,632 --> 02:09:06,935
Remove... - Poverty...

1931
02:09:07,139 --> 02:09:10,267
Don't take away...
- Don't take away our rights.

1932
02:09:10,476 --> 02:09:17,780
Handcuff the police.
We'll give them a run for their money.

1933
02:09:17,983 --> 02:09:20,383
Today, they're in for some boons from Saamy(God).

1934
02:09:22,654 --> 02:09:24,281
They're raising slogans without
knowing our D.C.

1935
02:09:25,991 --> 02:09:28,789
Sir, as soon as we cross Corporation
office, we'll get weapons.

1936
02:09:29,161 --> 02:09:31,721
l'll make the first kill of D.C.
- Okay.

1937
02:09:31,930 --> 02:09:33,124
We must do as sir has ordered us.

1938
02:09:33,332 --> 02:09:35,800
Hello... - We'll be reaching
Corporation office shortly.

1939
02:09:36,001 --> 02:09:37,730
We are ready.
- You must strictly follow my orders.

1940
02:09:43,509 --> 02:09:45,306
We are hearing. - Okay sir.

1941
02:09:46,678 --> 02:09:48,407
Get the ambulance ready.
- Okay, sir.

1942
02:09:50,015 --> 02:09:53,815
We are going to teach a
lesson to the police.

1943
02:09:54,019 --> 02:10:00,322
Don't take away our rights.

1944
02:10:00,526 --> 02:10:04,826
Tirunelveli district is going
to teach you a lesson.

1945
02:10:05,030 --> 02:10:05,655
Baton charge.

1946
02:10:08,700 --> 02:10:09,667
Ambulance is ready.

1947
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:23,347
Hey, who's throwing
stones at us?

1948
02:10:23,549 --> 02:10:24,345
Stop it.

1949
02:10:24,716 --> 02:10:25,182
Beat them back, boys.

1950
02:10:26,051 --> 02:10:27,916
Baton charge!

1951
02:10:29,054 --> 02:10:31,181
Down with Police atrocities....

1952
02:10:31,390 --> 02:10:32,857
Hey, stop.

1953
02:10:33,725 --> 02:10:39,357
Down with the Police atrocities.

1954
02:10:42,067 --> 02:10:43,364
Tear gas.

1955
02:10:47,906 --> 02:10:49,703
Hey, don't spare them.
Beat them.

1956
02:11:24,776 --> 02:11:25,242
Go away.

1957
02:11:35,787 --> 02:11:37,914
You raped my sister.

1958
02:11:39,625 --> 02:11:41,525
Hereafter you can never rape any girl.

1959
02:11:46,798 --> 02:11:49,266
Hey, how dare you catch me?
l'm an MLA.

1960
02:11:49,468 --> 02:11:49,991
Come, man.

1961
02:11:52,304 --> 02:11:53,999
How can l fire without orders?

1962
02:11:54,473 --> 02:11:56,600
My pistol and six bullets are here.

1963
02:11:56,808 --> 02:11:57,274
Then, who shot them dead?

1964
02:11:57,476 --> 02:11:59,774
5000 people were in that procession.
10,000 people were watching the fun.

1965
02:11:59,978 --> 02:12:01,104
How can l know who shot them dead?

1966
02:12:01,313 --> 02:12:02,940
So, l was against giving
them permission.

1967
02:12:03,148 --> 02:12:04,615
Now, you're responsible for
all the trouble.

1968
02:12:04,983 --> 02:12:07,451
Okay! Atleast release that
Athankarai Shanmugam.

1969
02:12:07,653 --> 02:12:09,280
Till l get clear evidence
about the death of 3 people,

1970
02:12:09,488 --> 02:12:10,284
l'll not release them.

1971
02:12:10,489 --> 02:12:13,117
Are you talking so bravely as your
records are straight?

1972
02:12:13,659 --> 02:12:15,627
You don't know the
reach of Annachi!

1973
02:12:15,827 --> 02:12:17,124
l don't want to know.

1974
02:12:27,005 --> 02:12:27,630
Greetings sir.

1975
02:12:27,839 --> 02:12:30,307
Why're you greeting me, man?
Fire...fire at me.

1976
02:12:31,009 --> 02:12:33,569
He shot my men.
You fire at me.

1977
02:12:33,845 --> 02:12:35,244
Welcome, Perumal Pitchai.

1978
02:12:35,681 --> 02:12:40,311
You've killed my men and accounted
their deaths under communal clashes.

1979
02:12:40,519 --> 02:12:43,317
lt's true, l shot them dead, then.
lt's true your men saw me.

1980
02:12:43,522 --> 02:12:44,318
But, there are no records.

1981
02:12:44,523 --> 02:12:48,983
Hey, are you teaching me the game
in which l'm an expert?

1982
02:12:49,194 --> 02:12:50,991
lf there's a reason,
l'll use Government pistol.

1983
02:12:51,196 --> 02:12:52,493
Or else an illegal pistol.

1984
02:12:52,864 --> 02:12:54,661
A sickle used by anyone
will hurt you.

1985
02:12:55,200 --> 02:12:56,997
A pistol fired by
anyone will kill.

1986
02:12:57,869 --> 02:12:58,665
Watch out, in 2 days...

1987
02:12:58,870 --> 02:12:59,837
How dare you point your
finger at Annachi?

1988
02:13:00,038 --> 02:13:01,665
Oh, shouldn't l talk pointing
a finger at him?

1989
02:13:06,545 --> 02:13:10,504
l'll make you run away
leaving everything behind.

1990
02:13:10,716 --> 02:13:15,176
Down with police atrocities.

1991
02:13:15,387 --> 02:13:21,690
People waiting outside will kill any
number of people on a hint from me.

1992
02:13:21,893 --> 02:13:25,021
The guns here will fire at any
number of people on my orders.

1993
02:13:25,230 --> 02:13:27,198
l'll immolate here for Annachi.

1994
02:13:28,734 --> 02:13:30,702
l'll immolate here.

1995
02:13:30,902 --> 02:13:38,206
Down with Police atrocities.

1996
02:13:38,410 --> 02:13:39,877
l'll immolate for Annachi.

1997
02:13:45,250 --> 02:13:46,649
l think he'll really burn us down...
Run away from here.

1998
02:13:47,753 --> 02:13:48,378
Run away.

1999
02:13:53,425 --> 02:13:54,722
l'm like a live wire.

2000
02:13:55,260 --> 02:13:56,659
lf you touch, you can't
bear the shock.

2001
02:14:01,933 --> 02:14:04,401
He has insulted us.
Annachi, what shall we do now?

2002
02:14:04,603 --> 02:14:08,130
lnform our boys in Kaitharu
and get him lynched.

2003
02:14:08,774 --> 02:14:11,072
l was never afraid even when l
went against the British.

2004
02:14:11,443 --> 02:14:14,469
But, l'm damn scared
of these murderers.

2005
02:14:15,447 --> 02:14:18,416
l'm anticipating trouble here
any moment.

2006
02:14:18,617 --> 02:14:20,244
When there are so many
policemen around,

2007
02:14:20,452 --> 02:14:22,579
And when they are not bothered,
why are you?

2008
02:14:22,788 --> 02:14:25,916
Son-in-law, everyone has come
out with fear.

2009
02:14:26,124 --> 02:14:27,591
l don't know what to say.

2010
02:14:27,959 --> 02:14:32,589
You both must be safe & happy.

2011
02:14:32,964 --> 02:14:35,592
Anyway, you're going out from
here on a transfer.

2012
02:14:35,801 --> 02:14:38,429
You go away today.
No one will be in any trouble.

2013
02:14:38,637 --> 02:14:41,538
Son-in-law...
- Father, all of you may go now.

2014
02:14:42,407 --> 02:14:43,339
Nothing will happen to me.

2015
02:14:44,242 --> 02:14:45,869
You don't unnecessarily
make him tense.

2016
02:14:46,645 --> 02:14:47,111
Please go away.

2017
02:14:50,816 --> 02:14:55,378
Did you send them out to pacify me?
Or are you really confident about me?

2018
02:14:56,321 --> 02:14:58,846
lf anything happens to me,
you'll be the worst affected.

2019
02:14:59,991 --> 02:15:01,959
lf your confidence in me has dipped
even by 1 percent, tell me.

2020
02:15:02,427 --> 02:15:03,223
We'll leave this place.

2021
02:15:05,664 --> 02:15:09,964
l've 100% confidence in you.
You'll definitely win.

2022
02:15:14,906 --> 02:15:17,704
Brother, son-in-law hasn't taken
any of our advise.

2023
02:15:18,009 --> 02:15:22,036
You advise him. - You don't worry.
l'll talk to him.

2024
02:15:29,688 --> 02:15:32,156
Are you scared? - No.

2025
02:15:32,357 --> 02:15:33,585
Why're your eyes
filled with tears?

2026
02:15:34,192 --> 02:15:35,056
Sacred ash fell into my eyes.

2027
02:15:35,360 --> 02:15:36,987
Son, where are you?
- ln the temple, father.

2028
02:15:37,195 --> 02:15:38,492
l heard you had been transferred.

2029
02:15:38,697 --> 02:15:39,994
l heard you're in some trouble.

2030
02:15:40,198 --> 02:15:41,165
Shall l come there?

2031
02:15:41,366 --> 02:15:42,663
No need. Problem will be
solved in 2 days.

2032
02:15:43,034 --> 02:15:44,001
l'll come back there.

2033
02:15:44,202 --> 02:15:45,169
Don't unnecessarily come here.

2034
02:15:45,537 --> 02:15:46,003
Okay, son.

2035
02:16:03,221 --> 02:16:04,916
Bhuvana, remove your slippers and
go into the temple immediately.

2036
02:16:05,123 --> 02:16:05,589
Why?

2037
02:16:05,957 --> 02:16:06,685
Just follow my orders.

2038
02:16:07,292 --> 02:16:08,088
Sister, take her.

2039
02:17:06,751 --> 02:17:11,211
Can't you understand why a man
is running away with a pistol?

2040
02:17:13,024 --> 02:17:16,289
lf l beat you in front of the temple,
it'll be a disturbance to devotees.

2041
02:17:18,029 --> 02:17:22,591
lt's better to slaughter a goat in
a closed area than on the road.

2042
02:17:27,806 --> 02:17:28,534
What're you looking at?

2043
02:17:29,674 --> 02:17:31,665
God will get into a trance only
when drums are beaten.

2044
02:19:08,206 --> 02:19:10,766
Saamy has told you not to go there.
Why're you going there?

2045
02:19:10,975 --> 02:19:15,071
No, l'm anxious.
l'll check personally.

2046
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:17,214
Bhuvana, you leave for
Palani immediately. - Why?

2047
02:19:17,415 --> 02:19:18,780
We've just 24 hours.

2048
02:19:19,284 --> 02:19:20,774
You mustn't get into any
trouble before that.

2049
02:19:21,486 --> 02:19:22,714
l'll come there by
tomorrow evening.

2050
02:19:22,987 --> 02:19:24,113
Who's going with you?

2051
02:19:24,322 --> 02:19:25,220
l'm going alone, mother.

2052
02:19:25,423 --> 02:19:26,617
Go safely, dear.

2053
02:19:26,825 --> 02:19:27,291
Okay, mother.

2054
02:19:28,760 --> 02:19:29,226
Tell me, Babu.

2055
02:19:29,427 --> 02:19:32,396
Perumal Pitchai talked to
Pattasu Raman of Sivakasi.

2056
02:19:32,597 --> 02:19:33,256
What did he say?

2057
02:19:33,465 --> 02:19:36,400
He said we must create a
`loud noise' in Tirunelveli.

2058
02:19:36,901 --> 02:19:39,665
l think `loud noise' is
their code word.

2059
02:19:40,739 --> 02:19:42,468
ln Sivakasi, bursting of crackers
will make loud noise.

2060
02:19:42,674 --> 02:19:45,142
Crackers, loud noise?
Anything connected with bomb?

2061
02:19:46,511 --> 02:19:47,307
lt must be a bomb.

2062
02:19:47,579 --> 02:19:51,208
l want to talk to you...Come...

2063
02:19:52,183 --> 02:19:53,741
No. l'll get into the jeep
without warrant.

2064
02:19:54,986 --> 02:19:55,884
l've not come in a jeep.

2065
02:19:56,221 --> 02:19:59,748
You're facing charges of 4 murders, arson,
stabbing and many other crimes.

2066
02:20:00,024 --> 02:20:02,584
We can put you in jail
for 12 years.

2067
02:20:03,862 --> 02:20:07,491
Or else with one shot,
l can close the file as a murder.

2068
02:20:09,701 --> 02:20:10,429
Don't get scared.

2069
02:20:11,369 --> 02:20:12,996
l would've killed you that day,
if had l wanted to.

2070
02:20:14,205 --> 02:20:16,002
When l shot others,
l saw only individuals.

2071
02:20:16,207 --> 02:20:19,005
But, when l aimed at you,
l saw your wife & children.

2072
02:20:19,711 --> 02:20:20,507
lf you follow my orders.

2073
02:20:20,712 --> 02:20:23,408
l'll dilute the cases so that you'll
get 2 or 3 years jail term.

2074
02:20:23,748 --> 02:20:24,237
What do you say?

2075
02:20:25,483 --> 02:20:26,848
l'll always keep up my promise.

2076
02:20:27,886 --> 02:20:28,511
Okay.

2077
02:20:28,720 --> 02:20:33,248
Annachi has called Pattasu Raman
to plant a bomb here. - Why?

2078
02:20:34,058 --> 02:20:35,525
To plant a bomb in your house.

2079
02:20:35,727 --> 02:20:37,024
What're you saying man?

2080
02:20:37,228 --> 02:20:41,358
He has asked him plant the bomb
to go off at 10.30 p.m.

2081
02:20:41,966 --> 02:20:43,763
And asked him to stay
at Hotel Sugam.

2082
02:20:43,968 --> 02:20:45,196
Sir, let's go immediately. - No.

2083
02:20:47,238 --> 02:20:48,034
Let the bomb go off.

2084
02:20:49,073 --> 02:20:50,040
What're you saying sir?

2085
02:20:51,743 --> 02:20:53,711
This is the only way to
arrest Perumal Pitchai.

2086
02:20:53,912 --> 02:20:55,880
He has become an approver.
We can arrest Pattasu Raman.

2087
02:20:56,080 --> 02:20:58,207
With this evidence we can arrest him.
- Case will not stand in the court.

2088
02:20:58,783 --> 02:21:00,717
Because of the influence he has,
he'll walk out freely.

2089
02:21:01,252 --> 02:21:01,980
Let my house get blasted off.

2090
02:21:02,420 --> 02:21:04,684
Only then, l can arrest him under
Terrorist act. - Then, Bhuvana?

2091
02:21:04,889 --> 02:21:05,787
She's on the way to Palani.

2092
02:21:05,990 --> 02:21:08,049
Look, the bomb will
blast at 10.30 p.m.

2093
02:21:08,259 --> 02:21:10,056
Arrest Pattasu Raman
exactly at 10.35 p.m.

2094
02:21:10,261 --> 02:21:11,728
l'll go & meet the Commissioner. - Why?

2095
02:21:13,198 --> 02:21:14,995
Department must know Annachi
has planted a bomb.

2096
02:21:15,733 --> 02:21:17,098
But they mustn't
know the location.

2097
02:21:17,435 --> 02:21:19,027
No one can harm my son.

2098
02:21:19,671 --> 02:21:21,400
lf you all stay here,
he'll give up a winning race.

2099
02:21:22,207 --> 02:21:24,072
And spend his entire energy
to save your lives.

2100
02:21:24,275 --> 02:21:25,867
So, go to Palani immediately.

2101
02:21:26,211 --> 02:21:28,372
No one can harm my son
till l'm alive.

2102
02:21:28,613 --> 02:21:30,012
l'll come with him tomorrow.

2103
02:21:30,215 --> 02:21:33,082
Pattasu Raman come immediately. We must
create a loud noise in Tirunelveli.

2104
02:21:35,153 --> 02:21:39,419
lf we touch Annachi, we'll get orders
from C.M.. Who'll face the consequences.

2105
02:21:39,624 --> 02:21:42,092
lf we don't take any action
and the bomb goes off.

2106
02:21:42,293 --> 02:21:44,261
Still, we've to face the heat from C.M.
- Everything is your doing.

2107
02:21:44,462 --> 02:21:46,760
For the action you took against them
in the procession.

2108
02:21:46,965 --> 02:21:49,593
Tell me your decision to
solve this problem.

2109
02:21:50,802 --> 02:21:52,929
First, send a message of alert
to all police stations.

2110
02:22:00,144 --> 02:22:01,111
Sir, here are the keys.

2111
02:22:02,847 --> 02:22:03,871
Shall l get you something to eat?

2112
02:22:04,082 --> 02:22:07,381
No need. l'll eat along
with my son. - Okay sir.

2113
02:22:21,866 --> 02:22:22,457
Hello.

2114
02:22:22,667 --> 02:22:23,861
l'm Saamy's father speaking.

2115
02:22:24,068 --> 02:22:25,558
Sir has gone to meet Commissioner.

2116
02:22:25,837 --> 02:22:26,633
You call him on his cell phone.

2117
02:22:29,374 --> 02:22:31,171
Sir is in a meeting
with Commissioner.

2118
02:22:31,342 --> 02:22:32,809
So, he has left his phone with me.

2119
02:22:33,077 --> 02:22:35,568
Tell him, l've come here.
l'll talk to him later.

2120
02:22:39,450 --> 02:22:40,747
Sir, you got a call
from your father.

2121
02:22:43,354 --> 02:22:45,322
From where did he call me?
- He called from your house only.

2122
02:22:46,658 --> 02:22:47,215
What are you saying?

2123
02:22:47,525 --> 02:22:49,152
He said he had come just now
from your native place.

2124
02:22:49,527 --> 02:22:51,154
Oh shit!

2125
02:22:58,870 --> 02:23:01,498
My daughter-in-law and her
relatives are coming there.

2126
02:23:01,706 --> 02:23:03,833
Take good care of them.
- Okay sir.

2127
02:23:06,878 --> 02:23:08,175
They're strict vegetarians.

2128
02:23:08,379 --> 02:23:10,176
Tell servants to clean the
vessels thoroughly.

2129
02:23:11,549 --> 02:23:14,347
lt seems some Perumal Pitchai
is troubling my son.

2130
02:23:14,886 --> 02:23:17,013
l'll kill him myself
and go to jail.

2131
02:23:17,221 --> 02:23:18,882
But, l'll not allow him
to touch my son.

2132
02:23:26,564 --> 02:23:27,963
Father, come out of the
house immediately.

2133
02:23:28,166 --> 02:23:28,757
Why?

2134
02:23:28,967 --> 02:23:30,798
A bomb has been planted in our house.
Come out immediately.

2135
02:23:31,736 --> 02:23:32,202
What?

2136
02:23:35,740 --> 02:23:36,365
Oh my god!

2137
02:23:43,915 --> 02:23:44,540
Father...

2138
02:23:46,017 --> 02:23:48,645
Father...

2139
02:23:49,253 --> 02:23:50,379
Father...

2140
02:23:59,430 --> 02:24:00,055
Father...

2141
02:24:01,265 --> 02:24:01,890
Father...

2142
02:24:18,082 --> 02:24:20,550
Father...

2143
02:24:34,799 --> 02:24:36,426
He has been with
Annachi for 16 years.

2144
02:24:36,968 --> 02:24:38,265
l wish to become an approver.

2145
02:24:44,142 --> 02:24:45,700
l heard about it...sorry.

2146
02:24:48,646 --> 02:24:49,203
Best of luck.

2147
02:24:49,480 --> 02:24:51,607
l told you to keep cool for 2 days.

2148
02:24:51,983 --> 02:24:53,280
Why did you plant
a bomb in his house?

2149
02:24:53,484 --> 02:24:55,213
Already he's after you
like a mad dog.

2150
02:24:55,653 --> 02:24:57,848
He made a fool proof
case against you.

2151
02:24:58,056 --> 02:24:59,455
And has taken arrest
warrant against you.

2152
02:24:59,657 --> 02:25:04,959
l can't help you anymore. Abscond for a
day or get yourself arrested.

2153
02:25:05,496 --> 02:25:07,123
Whom are you suggesting
to surrender?

2154
02:25:07,432 --> 02:25:10,128
lf l get arrested, Tirunelveli will
rise against him.

2155
02:25:10,668 --> 02:25:12,295
lnsult...it's an insult.

2156
02:25:12,670 --> 02:25:15,969
Getting arrested is impossible
in my life.

2157
02:25:16,174 --> 02:25:18,802
Okay. l'll talk to him
once again for you.

2158
02:25:20,678 --> 02:25:25,138
Hey, kill everyone in his family.

2159
02:25:25,349 --> 02:25:27,647
He has already packed them
all to his native place.

2160
02:25:33,958 --> 02:25:36,256
Sir, call from the Commissioner.

2161
02:25:36,461 --> 02:25:39,589
An urgent secret meeting has
been arranged in our Dept.

2162
02:25:39,797 --> 02:25:40,923
You must come immediately.

2163
02:25:41,466 --> 02:25:44,435
Ministers, MLAs, District Collectors
from 8 districts are coming.

2164
02:25:44,635 --> 02:25:45,602
You must attend without fail.

2165
02:25:47,805 --> 02:25:48,328
Hello...

2166
02:25:48,639 --> 02:25:49,765
l'm DC's wife speaking.

2167
02:25:50,141 --> 02:25:51,199
House phone is not responding,

2168
02:25:51,409 --> 02:25:52,273
l'm not able to reach him
on cell phone also.

2169
02:25:52,577 --> 02:25:54,602
Please give him the phone.
- Sir is in hospital.

2170
02:25:54,812 --> 02:25:55,938
Why? What happened to him?

2171
02:25:56,147 --> 02:25:57,614
Don't you know house was
blasted off with a bomb?

2172
02:25:57,815 --> 02:25:58,281
What're you saying?

2173
02:25:58,483 --> 02:26:02,442
Don't tell her. - Hello...hello...
What happened to him?

2174
02:26:02,653 --> 02:26:04,120
Sir is safe.
You don't worry.

2175
02:26:04,655 --> 02:26:05,451
Why did you tell her?

2176
02:26:05,656 --> 02:26:07,180
lt's midnight now.
You want to go there.

2177
02:26:07,391 --> 02:26:08,790
Your parents are on the way.

2178
02:26:08,993 --> 02:26:12,690
Even if l catch the last bus.
l'll reach by morning.

2179
02:26:12,897 --> 02:26:14,296
Drop me at bus stand.

2180
02:26:16,400 --> 02:26:18,061
Mr.Saamy, please don't
arrest Annachi.

2181
02:26:18,269 --> 02:26:20,464
lf you arrest him, it'll
create political problems.

2182
02:26:20,671 --> 02:26:23,139
Sorry sir. l don't care about it.

2183
02:26:23,341 --> 02:26:24,808
His influence extends from
State to Central level.

2184
02:26:25,343 --> 02:26:27,311
You're not going to
stay here tomorrow.

2185
02:26:27,512 --> 02:26:28,638
Then, why're you creating
trouble for him?

2186
02:26:28,846 --> 02:26:31,872
Ten years ago, you were
a vegetable seller.

2187
02:26:32,083 --> 02:26:32,981
Today, you're a Minister.

2188
02:26:33,351 --> 02:26:34,648
You own 5 colleges.

2189
02:26:34,852 --> 02:26:35,648
You don't say a word.

2190
02:26:36,187 --> 02:26:37,484
Why're you talking bad about him?

2191
02:26:37,688 --> 02:26:41,647
You're telling me not to arrest
an accused? - Are you Mr.Clean?

2192
02:26:42,026 --> 02:26:45,826
You had taken Rs.34 lakhs as
bribe from Annachi. - Deny it.

2193
02:26:46,864 --> 02:26:48,195
No.

2194
02:26:49,934 --> 02:26:53,836
He has given the list of bribes
he gave you, date-wise.

2195
02:26:55,873 --> 02:26:59,832
l didn't take Rs.34 lakhs,
but Rs.36 lakhs 50 thousand.

2196
02:27:00,745 --> 02:27:02,906
l was about to tell that he had
left out a few payments.

2197
02:27:04,715 --> 02:27:05,773
l've full account of it.

2198
02:27:06,551 --> 02:27:07,518
The money he paid me on a date....

2199
02:27:07,718 --> 02:27:08,946
l've sent it to Gujarat
Earth quake relief fund.

2200
02:27:09,153 --> 02:27:10,381
Orissa starvation deaths,
cyclone relief fund...

2201
02:27:10,588 --> 02:27:12,749
To CM's welfare fund...

2202
02:27:12,957 --> 02:27:14,720
l've receipts on his name
as money sent by him.

2203
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:23,698
What're you looking at?

2204
02:27:24,101 --> 02:27:26,365
Annachi is not a meek cat to kick.

2205
02:27:26,571 --> 02:27:27,037
He's an Elephant.

2206
02:27:27,805 --> 02:27:28,737
We must get on its head to beat it.

2207
02:27:29,407 --> 02:27:31,534
So, l took money from him
and his built trust on me.

2208
02:27:32,410 --> 02:27:33,035
Now, l'm beating him.

2209
02:27:33,411 --> 02:27:34,639
Then, you took Rs.4 lakhs
from a killer.

2210
02:27:34,912 --> 02:27:36,880
And Rs.3 lakhs from a man
who ran over another man...

2211
02:27:37,248 --> 02:27:38,215
On what account?

2212
02:27:40,418 --> 02:27:41,214
Justice Account!

2213
02:27:42,587 --> 02:27:43,713
lf we arrest any who runs over
another man with his car.

2214
02:27:43,921 --> 02:27:44,888
You'll jail him for 3 months.

2215
02:27:45,089 --> 02:27:46,113
He'll pay Rs.3000 as fine
and goes out scott free.

2216
02:27:46,324 --> 02:27:47,552
Who'll feed the victim's family?

2217
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:50,894
So, l took Rs.4 lakhs from him and
paid it to the victim's family.

2218
02:27:52,096 --> 02:27:53,893
l'm concerned about dead man
than the killer.

2219
02:27:54,765 --> 02:27:56,562
Tell me, if anyone has complained that
l've taken bribe from general public.

2220
02:27:56,767 --> 02:27:58,291
l'll kill myself at that very moment.

2221
02:27:59,770 --> 02:28:03,228
A man living on bribes will not have
2 sets of uniform & torn socks.

2222
02:28:04,609 --> 02:28:09,069
To join police! My father is still paying
interest on Rs.2 lakhs loan.

2223
02:28:09,447 --> 02:28:10,311
Leave it.

2224
02:28:10,681 --> 02:28:14,082
Are you running a police station
according to law or a jungle justice?

2225
02:28:14,452 --> 02:28:17,910
Will you change laws like
you change clothes?

2226
02:28:18,122 --> 02:28:19,248
What's so great about law?

2227
02:28:20,291 --> 02:28:21,758
When Tamil Nadu was
under Prohibition,

2228
02:28:21,959 --> 02:28:23,256
lf anyone drinks in Pondicherry
it's not a crime.

2229
02:28:23,794 --> 02:28:25,694
But, if he comes to nearby
Cuddalore, it's a crime.

2230
02:28:26,797 --> 02:28:29,265
Prostitution is legal in
Mumbai according to law.

2231
02:28:30,468 --> 02:28:31,594
The same thing is illegal here.

2232
02:28:32,970 --> 02:28:34,597
A law for each caste & state.

2233
02:28:35,473 --> 02:28:35,996
Forget about all that.

2234
02:28:37,308 --> 02:28:39,435
l've not yet performed
my dead father's last rites.

2235
02:28:40,144 --> 02:28:43,341
You're asking me not to arrest
his killer. What's this law?

2236
02:28:43,547 --> 02:28:45,606
What's your final decision?
- l'm saying that l'll arrest him.

2237
02:28:45,917 --> 02:28:48,283
l may be forced to stop you
from arresting him,

2238
02:28:48,653 --> 02:28:49,278
Are you threatening me?

2239
02:28:50,154 --> 02:28:51,951
l came into this world
killing five people.

2240
02:28:52,890 --> 02:28:54,619
lf anyone stops me in
discharging my duty.

2241
02:28:55,493 --> 02:28:56,721
l'll kill anyone
& any number of people.

2242
02:28:56,928 --> 02:28:58,452
lf you arrest him.
l'll hack you.

2243
02:29:00,731 --> 02:29:01,459
l'm like wind.

2244
02:29:01,999 --> 02:29:03,694
l'll be omnipresent,
but no one can see me.

2245
02:29:04,068 --> 02:29:06,798
Neither you can see me
nor catch me,

2246
02:29:15,346 --> 02:29:17,644
Hey, Saamy's wife...
- Yes...yes.

2247
02:29:18,182 --> 02:29:18,807
Come quickly.

2248
02:29:48,879 --> 02:29:49,573
Hey, come on boys.

2249
02:29:56,554 --> 02:30:00,012
He has accounted for all the money he
received from you. lncluding interest.

2250
02:30:00,391 --> 02:30:01,517
We can't take any action against him.

2251
02:30:01,892 --> 02:30:02,824
lf possible try to escape.

2252
02:30:03,094 --> 02:30:03,685
Don't disturb us.

2253
02:30:18,743 --> 02:30:20,870
Sir, l'm Annamalai from
Madurai Highway. - Tell me.

2254
02:30:21,078 --> 02:30:22,204
Annachi's car is coming here.

2255
02:30:22,913 --> 02:30:23,538
Don't arrest him.

2256
02:30:26,083 --> 02:30:26,879
But don't allow him to
leave the district.

lf you're bent upon arresting me...
Then, go ahead. Arrest me.

2301
02:36:52,803 --> 02:36:54,270
Who said l'm going to arrest you?

02:36:55,305 --> 02:36:57,796
Tirunelveli will go up in flames.

2303
02:36:58,642 --> 02:37:00,109
Poor innocent public

You'll exterminate my entire clan.

Did you see today's paper?

2308
02:37:09,386 --> 02:37:12,480
''Perumal Pitchai is Absconding.
Police are on his trail''

2309
02:37:13,657 --> 02:37:16,956
Why should l be afraid of you & run?

Arrest me, l say.

lf l arrest you, it'll be
a problem for people.

2312
02:37:23,267 --> 02:37:24,791
lf you're killed, they'll make you
a patriot & put up your statue.

2313
02:37:25,169 --> 02:37:26,898
And scores of Perumal Pitchais
will generate from under it.

2314
02:37:28,172 --> 02:37:31,107
Tirunelveli would be agog
with your absconding news.

2315
02:37:32,743 --> 02:37:34,472
Let you be an absconder
all your life.

2316
02:37:35,412 --> 02:37:37,744
Let police hunt you eternally.

2317
02:37:38,849 --> 02:37:39,816
But, you'll never be found.

2318
02:37:43,187 --> 02:37:46,987
lt must be recorded that you
got scared of me & absconded.

2319
02:37:48,192 --> 02:37:49,819
Do legally whatever
you want to do.

2320
02:37:50,727 --> 02:37:51,989
You can only destroy.

2321

02:37:55,332 --> 02:37:56,162

2323
02:38:01,705 --> 02:38:02,603
And l can destroy too.

2324
02:38:55,759 --> 02:38:58,227
Saamy's hunt will go on....
