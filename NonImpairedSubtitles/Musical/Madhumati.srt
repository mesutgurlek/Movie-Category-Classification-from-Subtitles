1
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,063
What is the time?
- It is ten past eight.

2
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,065
Ten past eight?
We are very late.

3
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,397
Please drive faster.
- Are you crazy?

4
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,229
This stormy night and
these bad roads.

5
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,075
There are still twenty
two miles left.

6
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,086
Why don't you drive
a bit faster?

7
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,088
Why are you acting so hasty?

8
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,097
Whether sister-in-law
is worried or not..

9
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,291
But my dear friend..

10
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,448
Sir..

11
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,130
Shall we take this?
- Yes.

12
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,475
What happened?

13
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,141
Sir. These are very big rocks.

14
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,479
You please go and
sit in the car.

15
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,155
Go. You go. Run and go.

16
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,355
There is a landlord's
bungalow up there.

17
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,159
You please go and rest there.

18
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,498
We will surely be trapped
in this rain.

19
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,161
Come on. We will go
to the bungalow.

20
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,463
will sit here.

21
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,176
Come on. Come on.

22
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,533
There is
- There is nobody inside.

23
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,468
Now that we have come,
let us see.

24
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,239
Who opened the door?

25
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:47,246
I did. The door opener
is there. And you?

26
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,914
Yes. Why not? Please come.

27
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,267
It seems to be a very
old bungalow.

28
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,294
Yes. There was. But
it fell down..

29
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,626
This is the limit.

30
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,342
He will take some
time to arrange..

31
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,016
See if the rain has
settled down or not.

32
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,372
Doctor..

33
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,382
No.

34
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,397
No. I don't want brandy
or anything.

35
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,070
Who?
- What happened?

36
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,075
Did you hear some girl
shouting? - No.

37
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,084
Maybe I had some misconception.

38
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,870
I had prepared it.

39
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,546
I don't know anything
about that.

40
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,881
What happened? What
noise was it?

41
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,062
He was the last landlord
of this area.

42
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,576
Sir..

43
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,597
Sir..

44
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:49,327
I remember it now. I
remember it clearly.

45
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,334
Maybe it is of the
previous birth.

46
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,022
As if it was inviting me.

47
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,796
''I am afraid, I don't
get lost somewhere.''

48
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,820
''Who smiles hiding
in the flowers?''

49
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,825
''For what is the
spring yearning?''

50
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,831
''There is a bulbul somewhere.''

51
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:13,599
''These seas dance and
trip like this.''

52
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:17,595
''That sky is coming
down on the earth.''

53
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,944
''We haven't seen
scene anywhere.''

54
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,984
Sir, don't go ahead.

55
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:35,671
''Come..''

56
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,350
''O foreigner..''

57
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,040
Brother.. is this the
way to Shamghad?

58
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,042
This side or that side?

59
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,040
I understood.

60
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,724
Not down. Up here.

61
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,461
Oh god!

62
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,060
Who are you then?

63
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,078
Here.

64
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,080
Hey..

65
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,415
I will tell you if you
give me four annas.

66
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,092
Here you are. We are
right now, isn't it?

67
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,492
What is your name?

68
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,096
You tell me first.

69
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,428
My name is Anand.

70
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,103
Greetings.

71
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,502
Listen..

72
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:16,773
Shamgadh? Timber estate?
Mr. Anand?

73
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,445
Your name is Anand?

74
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,781
Yes. I have told that
my name is Anand.

75
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,794
You please come with me.

76
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,488
It is quite a beautiful place.

77
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,163
It seems beautiful to you now?

78
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,175
You are really very tired?

79
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,177
Why don't you drink
a cup of tea?

80
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,191
And the biggest one here is..

81
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,194
The best person here is
the accountant here.

82
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,199
Greetings, sir.

83
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,359
Did you have any troubles
on the way?

84
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,526
No. I didn't have any troubles.

85
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,306
I'd sent Charan. He is
a bit of a drunkard.

86
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,206
There is a liquor
shop in the way.

87
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,613
..then how would sir reach here?

88
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,208
No..
- Okay. Everything is all right.

89
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,880
I will come to work
from tomorrow.

90
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,219
Look around the area
a bit. You will..

91
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,764
..get to see excellent
scenes here.

92
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,233
But we are unfortunate.

93
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,240
You are new here, isn't
it? Please take care.

94
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,774
Everyone here is a thief.

95
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,909
I am a child.
- You fool!

96
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,921
Sir. You please have some rest.

97
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,261
And please tell me if
you need anything.

98
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,260
What are you doing
standing there?

99
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:14,017
''Come..

100
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,958
'' O foreigner..''

101
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:50,657
''My eyes are waiting for you.''

102
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,380
It was very good at that time.

103
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,789
And where is his son nowadays?

104
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,727
Because he become the chief now.

105
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,402
Sir. Greetings.
- Greetings.

106
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,407
This is our new manager, Anand.

107
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,402
Greetings.
- Greetings.

108
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,575
We cut seven hundred
trees today.

109
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,892
Leave something
for tomorrow too.

110
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,154
Come on. Come to the office.
- Yes, come on.

111
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,426
Sir..
- Yes?

112
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,765
What is this?

113
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,764
Let it be, sir.

114
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,108
Sir.. this letter.

115
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,448
Oh my god!
- What happened?

116
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,453
The younger king is coming here.

117
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,790
So what is to be
so scared in it?

118
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,566
No sir. There is nothing
to be scared in it.

119
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:14,197
Veer Singh.. Veer Singh..
oh Veer Singh..

120
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,476
Where have everyone died?

121
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,478
Sir..

122
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,489
Yes. I have heard it.

123
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,486
And the public there
is dead in fear.

124
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,824
And it doesn't have
any effect on you?

125
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,160
Why will it affect me?

126
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,170
Sir.. sir..

127
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,843
Sir.. sir..

128
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,507
Sir..

129
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:05,520
I forgot to tell you something.

130
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,920
Why?

131
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,929
There are big and strange
animal here.

132
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,534
There are beasts here too.

133
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,868
I cannot think that
you are a animal.

134
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,075
Forget about animals,
please come here.

135
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,542
The company people have
put up a notice.

136
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,945
Nobody can go there.
- You go.

137
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,218
I was going down here.

138
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:03,630
''Please come..

139
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,638
o foreigner..''

140
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:38,337
''My eyes are waiting for you.''

141
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:25,052
''I am such a wick of light..''

142
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:29,778
''We were to stay throughout
births.''

143
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:34,792
''Why did you forget
it, o beloved?''

144
00:31:50,308 --> 00:32:32,283
''I yearn all through
the day and night.''

145
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:36,845
''I am a lake and yet
I am thirsty.''

146
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:41,851
''This is a deep secret
but a small matter.''

147
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:02,208
''Without every thing
is so incomplete.''

148
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,064
Who are you? What is your name?

149
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,067
Madhumati.

150
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,060
Why did you steal my picture?

151
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,095
Please don't cut my
money this month.

152
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,425
My house and door all
has fallen down.

153
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,089
Please cut my money
the next month.

154
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,428
What are you saying?

155
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,094
I will die. -
If you don't die, I will die

156
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,098
Kill me..
- Give me the money.

157
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,446
Please give me justice, sir.

158
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,448
Shut up.

159
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,114
Veer Singh.. give
him back the money.

160
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,120
Okay.

161
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,487
Charan..
- Yes?

162
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,160
Where are these girls going?

163
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,162
Girls?

164
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,166
Oh! What can be said
about them, sir?

165
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,168
The girls are an excellent race.

166
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,831
They come and go in a breeze.

167
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,184
They go to the fair
every year, sir.

168
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,177
But you please don't go there.

169
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,516
Why shouldn't I go there?

170
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,194
Will you go there?
- Yes. I will go there.

171
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:20,193
Yes? Then I will go there too.

172
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,758
''I saw a heartless man..''

173
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:04,521
''I saw a heartless man.''

174
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,374
''What kind of night was this?''

175
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,414
''He plays the flute secretly.''

176
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:12,090
''He makes me hear
an exciting song.''

177
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:21,437
''He calls me in the
shadow of the stars.''

178
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,442
''He steal my sleep,
I keep awake.''

179
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:38,116
''He is behind me.''

180
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:28,164
''The illness increases
as we talk.''

181
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:50,526
''See my craziness someone.''

182
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:03,539
''I call the moon with
my beloved's name.''

183
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:07,068
''A magical wand worked
on my mind.''

184
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,950
Hey.. run run..

185
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:28,286
Run.. run..

186
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,631
My child.. my child..

187
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,640
You beast.

188
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:49,804
Who said it?

189
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,646
Sorry.

190
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:06,390
Bless you, brother.
You saved my son.

191
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:07,992
You are so good.

192
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,711
Sir, I am hurt.

193
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,043
Just like that.
- I will make you bleed.

194
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,376
Please wait.. I will
come right away.

195
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:10,726
Please let me see it.

196
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,397
I was scared.
- And now?

197
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,068
I am not scared now.

198
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,732
Why are you not scared now?

199
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:29,074
You are a good man,
sir. You risked..

200
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,340
..your life and saved
Manglu's brother.

201
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:33,279
Hey.. he was saved by his fate.

202
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:36,409
How am I connected with that?

203
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,756
Is it still paining you?
- Yes.

204
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,749
Then why don't you
come to my house?

205
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,760
Father will apply
some nice medicine.

206
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,090
Will he get angry?

207
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:50,423
If he will be happy, come on.
- Come on.

208
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,780
Listen.. Walk a bit slowly.

209
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:06,779
Please run and come.

210
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,780
How far is your house now?

211
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,790
Come.

212
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,786
Come on.

213
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:22,798
See that. Down there.

214
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,800
That is my house.

215
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,793
Is it down there?

216
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:27,962
Yes.

217
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,129
But how will we go down?

218
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:37,475
From here? Oh no! I
won't be able to go.

219
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,852
Come. Please come.

220
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,845
Father..

221
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:20,856
Where has he gone?

222
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,860
Father.. father..

223
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,526
Please sit. I will see, okay?

224
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:33,867
Father..

225
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,875
Father..

226
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,892
Father..

227
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:02,895
Who are you?

228
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,903
Who are you?

229
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,236
I.. me.. I am the manager..

230
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,905
Why did you come here?

231
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,244
I came with her..

232
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,908
Who?

233
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,919
I brought him, father. Yes.

234
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,933
Sit down.

235
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,600
Let me see where
you are wounded.

236
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,605
It is not a wound, I just
have a gash here.

237
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,486
Yes. Sir. It is a
small gash first.

238
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,284
And then, it is
a very big wound.

239
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,955
The medicine is a bit strong.

240
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:17,299
Sir.. are you new here?

241
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,975
I have come here a few days ago.

242
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,306
Just to wander around?

243
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,972
No, I work here.
- Where?

244
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,648
In work in his majesty's
timber estate.

245
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,317
Go away from here.

246
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,320
But what did I do?

247
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,994
Madhu..

248
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:54,006
Madhu..

249
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,004
Father..

250
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:00,342
He doesn't even know the way.

251
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,680
He will search for it.
Come on inside.

252
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:25,040
Charan..

253
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,200
Who is it? Who is it?

254
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,367
It is me.

255
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,707
You are in, then outside..

256
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:35,042
Sir, where were you
lost in the fair?

257
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,052
Listen, Charan..

258
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,068
He is Pand the king..

259
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,398
King?
- Yes.

260
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,062
His ancestors were kings.

261
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,077
Okay. The king of this time..

262
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,406
Enmity?

263
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,074
What are you talking
about enmity?

264
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,243
The company people
aren't permitted..

265
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,411
..to neither go there
and nor to talk there.

266
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,090
Why?
- Sir. Many years ago..

267
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:28,628
And he killed him, sir.
Not only this..

268
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,103
..they even did a
lot of injustice.

269
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,100
Ruined.

270
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,269
What I didn't want
to say, I said it.

271
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:43,110
Sir.. the betel nuts
here are excellent.

272
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,450
Why don't you eat
the betel nuts?

273
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:53,128
Jeevan.. how is the
work going around?

274
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,458
It is going on nicely.

275
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,122
Sir.. you are a educated
and learned man.

276
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,133
Why do you come
into the forest..

277
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,237
..everyday to look at
the work going on?

278
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,671
You should just sit
in the office.

279
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:10,473
The laborers are a
bit afraid of you.

280
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,138
Why? Am I the devil incarnate?

281
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,150
Sir.. the king has called you.

282
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,310
Yes. Tell him that
I am busy now.

283
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,477
I will come there in some time.

284
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:18,747
Please listen..

285
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,820
His majesty is a very
different man.

286
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,488
And please listen..

287
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,687
His majesty likes being praised.

288
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:28,491
If you just praise
him a little bit..

289
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,896
I will try to remember
your suggestion.

290
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,224
Did you like the photograph?

291
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,227
You..

292
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,557
Greetings.

293
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,221
Are you the new manager?
- Yes.

294
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:37,229
You are a brave man.

295
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:39,629
It was proved in the
fair that day.

296
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,968
You had called me?
- Yes.

297
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,240
Helplessly.

298
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:47,569
After I have come here,
everyone..

299
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,411
See.

300
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,578
When the employer comes, it is..

301
00:55:58,688 --> 00:55:59,780
..customary here to
come and greet him.

302
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:04,588
Know this.
- I know it now.

303
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:09,254
I was stuck up in
the old accounts.

304
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,594
It is cured.

305
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,736
If you'd see it, you'd
understand..

306
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,932
If I had to see it,
why would I pay you?

307
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,606
Please don't believe
any of your servant..

308
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,944
I will tell, not even me.

309
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:30,282
I praise the way you speak.

310
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,288
I live in the city normally.

311
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,620
I sometimes have to
come to this jungle.

312
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:38,954
There are servants
all around me here.

313
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,304
Ramsingh..
- Yes, sir?

314
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:56,974
You can go.
- Farewell. - Open it quickly!

315
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,667
He is a very good man at heart.

316
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,331
I have heard it. Where
are you going?

317
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,500
I am going to the
nearby village.

318
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:27,667
We will meet tomorrow.
- Where?

319
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,335
Here. At this time.

320
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,339
Madhu..
- I am coming, father.

321
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,681
Where had you stopped?

322
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,389
Sir..

323
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:19,056
Sir.. I have come.

324
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,387
Do you know what I had thought?

325
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,394
That I won't come, isn't it?
- Yes.

326
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,397
Didn't I promise you?

327
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:27,399
See sir, the tree is moving.

328
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:34,409
Like this and like that.
It is so happy.

329
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,740
Even I am happy.

330
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,417
I am just happy.

331
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:51,423
Madhmati..

332
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,095
I will make your picture, Madhu.

333
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:02,767
You will make a picture?
Make it.

334
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:28,790
I cannot sit down anymore, sir.

335
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,469
I am getting late.

336
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,799
Wait for a while more, Madhu.

337
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,463
The picture will be
done right away.

338
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:45,478
Sir.. see.
- What is the matter?

339
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,142
Come here. Come here.

340
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,814
What is the matter?

341
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,150
See. The ants are going home.

342
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,483
So what if the ants
are going home?

343
00:59:57,694 --> 00:59:59,491
The water is coming, isn't it?

344
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,497
Where is the water coming?

345
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,525
Where have you gone?

346
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,188
Please make the nose
a bit longer. A bit.

347
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,863
The sun?
- Yes.

348
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,539
Come on. Come on.
I will show you.

349
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:52,072
The sun hides there
in the night.

350
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,882
..from the cave behind
that mountain.

351
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,660
When we are sleeping,
it travels through..

352
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,096
..hell and goes back
there once again.

353
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:08,892
From down below?

354
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:16,568
I will make you understand.

355
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:18,570
You will make me understand?

356
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:27,243
Now go and sit on that
rock. Go. Go. Go.

357
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:31,583
Am I some tree or
some rock, that..

358
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,588
..I will be rooted at
one place?

359
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:35,919
I had come..

360
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:41,263
We will chat a bit. But you..

361
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,612
What are you staring at?

362
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,614
You.

363
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,621
Madhu..

364
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,623
God has made you so beautiful..

365
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,625
..that I cannot make
your portrait at all.

366
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,627
Look here.

367
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:30,636
Show me your face.

368
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:47,655
Someone is coming.

369
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,343
No. I just draw some
stupid lines.

370
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,698
I have made it with
my own thoughts.

371
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,700
Wow. You have a nice creativity.

372
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,709
You are right.

373
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:54,721
Let me go.
- No, I can't hear to anything.

374
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,731
Let me go!

375
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:58,730
No. nobody can go from here.

376
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,894
Please let me go. Please
have mercy on me.

377
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,732
I don't know any mercy
or anything.

378
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,740
Please let me go.
My son will die.

379
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,742
What can I do if your
son will die?

380
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,072
I beg you, please let me go.

381
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:10,736
No. nobody can go from here.

382
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,075
What is the matter, Veer Singh?

383
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:14,741
Sir.. he isn't letting
me go that side.

384
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:17,419
A snake has bitten my son.

385
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,288
Nobody except Pand can cure him.

386
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,761
Please tell him to let
us go that side.

387
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,091
Let these people go that side.

388
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:29,755
This is his majesty's orders.

389
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:36,430
Wait..
- Veer Singh!

390
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:41,769
You go.

391
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,799
Sit down.

392
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,474
And Mr. Anand and she are..

393
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:31,485
Okay. So this is the matter?

394
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,336
But even then he paints
her picture.

395
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:45,507
And he meets her too.
Near the lake.

396
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,833
Oh..

397
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:13,859
Are you in a haste
to go somewhere?

398
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,870
Yes. My work is done
for today and..

399
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,200
I have some work left.

400
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,885
Thank you.

401
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,931
''My heart beats
again and again.''

402
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:20,597
''Why does it beat
again and again?''

403
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:23,938
''Today, we are to meet.''

404
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:26,330
''I have got so much love.''

405
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:31,796
''Please brace yourself and see.''

406
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,101
So you are Mr. Anand's thoughts?

407
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,104
Let me go. Let me go!

408
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:49,255
''My heart yearns and says,
please come.''

409
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:28,300
''The roses have not bloomed
in your wait.''

410
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:57,329
''My heart yearns and says,
please come.''

411
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:25,359
''My life is so beautiful
because of you.''

412
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:29,691
''I am living because
I Iove you.''

413
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:19,413
''There is the result
of laughing love.''

414
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:24,080
''Where are we, where
is my heart?''

415
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,826
''I don't know anything.''

416
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:37,421
''I don't know anything
where it is.''

417
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:58,449
Come closer.

418
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:00,454
Yes, come closer.
Don't talk to me.

419
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,458
Why didn't you come yesterday?

420
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:10,464
You don't know, Madhu.

421
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,796
If you were a man,
you'd have known..

422
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,464
..they don't give us
time for love at all.

423
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:20,803
Then why do you do such a job?

424
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:22,467
What else should I do?

425
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:31,476
I will bring food for you.

426
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:39,486
And a apartment?

427
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:41,495
That's enough. Your
needs are increasing.

428
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:47,232
Okay.. when you didn't
come yesterday..

429
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:50,833
What would have happened to you?

430
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:58,174
What if someone snatches
me from you?

431
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:02,516
I will kill him. Who is he?

432
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,849
Nobody. I was just
asking like that.

433
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:16,520
Where?
- Why don't you just come?

434
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:37,542
It is such a strange place.

435
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:41,214
I wanted to bring you here.
- Here? - Yes.

436
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,548
This is where I wanted
to bring you.

437
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:46,223
Do you see those rocks there?

438
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,568
There is so much of
peace and calm here.

439
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,575
All alone.

440
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,578
At that time, I am not alone.

441
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:08,582
I feel as if..

442
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:15,579
What are you saying?

443
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:21,255
Really, sir. Nothing
dies in this world.

444
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:43,143
And we have come somewhere..

445
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:45,276
..up from these
stars in the sky.

446
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:46,949
What kind of brightness is this?

447
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:37,333
''Oh!''

448
01:19:54,122 --> 01:20:00,357
''Filling the pot.. oh!''

449
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,103
''Oh!''

450
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:15,370
''The sinful scorpion
climbed up!''

451
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:03,086
''I will say some hymns.''

452
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:09,462
''The soft body..''

453
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:16,770
''Leave it and go.''

454
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,767
''Go!''

455
01:22:43,425 --> 01:22:47,521
'' Beloved, please come home.''

456
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:53,526
''Come home. Come home.''

457
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:19,890
''See, see.. the scorpion
has gone up.''

458
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:26,229
''The poison is gone,
the scorpion is left.''

459
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:43,977
You don't know.

460
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:52,978
I don't even care for
him even this much.

461
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:54,988
As much as you listen
to these sirs..

462
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:56,990
..they become as much pompous.

463
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:01,992
He wasn't giving me
a holiday at all.

464
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:05,328
When I became angry,
he became a goat.

465
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:08,331
And he started telling me.

466
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:09,994
He folded his hands.

467
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:11,333
And he told me..

468
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,339
And he even held my feet.

469
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:21,173
He was crying, he was crying.

470
01:25:21,282 --> 01:25:22,340
Then what?

471
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:30,023
And then?

472
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,030
Then?

473
01:25:38,132 --> 01:25:39,360
Sir.. sir..

474
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:42,027
Then I was scared and
took out this tie.

475
01:25:42,136 --> 01:25:44,366
I thought that if sir
asks me, I will..

476
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:46,702
..say that I am sorry.
- Then?

477
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:53,712
Please start and hit me.
This is your shoe.

478
01:25:54,148 --> 01:25:56,048
Let it be, sir. Please
come. Forget it.

479
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:58,380
Sir, Madhu is saying something.

480
01:25:58,486 --> 01:26:00,044
You won't do such a
stupid antic again.

481
01:26:00,154 --> 01:26:04,056
What about me? I will
write and go.

482
01:26:08,763 --> 01:26:11,231
All this is because of alcohol.

483
01:26:11,432 --> 01:26:13,730
You please don't drink
it. It is very bad.

484
01:26:24,178 --> 01:26:26,078
You dance very well.

485
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:29,073
It is too late now.
Father will be angry.

486
01:26:29,784 --> 01:26:32,082
I will reach quickly
on the forest road.

487
01:26:36,190 --> 01:26:38,090
I am a wild girl, sir.

488
01:26:41,195 --> 01:26:42,423
Okay.

489
01:27:20,234 --> 01:27:22,134
Where are you going?

490
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:27,131
Where are you going?

491
01:27:28,242 --> 01:27:30,142
Come on inside.

492
01:30:44,772 --> 01:30:47,332
Sir.. sir..

493
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:50,334
Madhu..

494
01:31:02,456 --> 01:31:04,356
You?

495
01:31:05,459 --> 01:31:07,689
I was dreaming about you.

496
01:31:17,938 --> 01:31:20,702
Sir.. how did you come here?

497
01:31:21,475 --> 01:31:23,375
I came to meet you.

498
01:31:23,811 --> 01:31:25,369
Did father come
to know about it?

499
01:31:43,364 --> 01:31:45,059
Sir..

500
01:31:45,165 --> 01:31:50,569
You are all wet. Sit
down. Sit down.

501
01:32:03,384 --> 01:32:05,375
Here, take this fire.

502
01:32:07,288 --> 01:32:09,153
How can I tell you?

503
01:32:09,456 --> 01:32:11,424
What happened, sir?

504
01:32:12,192 --> 01:32:16,094
When you didn't come,
god knows..

505
01:32:25,205 --> 01:32:28,106
The rain surrounded
me from all sides.

506
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:32,709
All of them made a storm
set in my heart.

507
01:32:34,214 --> 01:32:36,273
I couldn't tolerate
it. I came here.

508
01:32:37,318 --> 01:32:40,287
I fell down and
got up many times..

509
01:32:41,488 --> 01:32:43,649
I wasn't in my senses.

510
01:32:44,224 --> 01:32:46,715
When I raised and looked around.

511
01:32:48,228 --> 01:32:50,196
You were there everywhere.

512
01:33:09,516 --> 01:33:13,145
Oh! You are crying!

513
01:33:14,455 --> 01:33:18,152
You took such pain,
sir. And me..

514
01:33:18,258 --> 01:33:21,819
..the fool just smiled
and slept here.

515
01:33:22,529 --> 01:33:24,895
If only this is the
case everything.

516
01:33:26,266 --> 01:33:28,564
How many ever storms
and lightning.

517
01:33:28,669 --> 01:33:30,330
All of them should
come in my share.

518
01:33:33,774 --> 01:33:37,767
No sir, I swear.

519
01:33:42,282 --> 01:33:43,772
I tell you.

520
01:33:43,884 --> 01:33:46,182
If I live, I will live
in your presence.

521
01:33:47,821 --> 01:33:49,686
No, Madhu.
- Really, sir.

522
01:33:49,823 --> 01:33:54,351
Even if I die, I will
stay with you.

523
01:33:56,497 --> 01:33:58,795
If I smile, I will
smile with you,

524
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,866
If I stay, I will stay with you.

525
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:31,555
Who had come here?

526
01:34:35,436 --> 01:34:38,894
Tell me. Tell me.

527
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:53,247
Okay. I will see it for myself.

528
01:34:56,557 --> 01:34:58,252
Father..

529
01:35:05,365 --> 01:35:07,333
Father..

530
01:35:13,907 --> 01:35:15,932
Father.. father..

531
01:35:23,717 --> 01:35:25,776
You wretch. You rogue.

532
01:35:33,594 --> 01:35:35,357
Take this.

533
01:35:35,462 --> 01:35:37,293
Slash my neck away, but don't..

534
01:35:41,401 --> 01:35:44,370
There is sin even in your blood.

535
01:35:50,010 --> 01:35:52,035
Get aside, Madhu.
- No, father no.

536
01:35:57,818 --> 01:35:59,649
You are very proud of
your love, isn't it?

537
01:35:59,753 --> 01:36:00,845
And I will be proud
of it till I die.

538
01:36:00,954 --> 01:36:01,978
You are lying.

539
01:36:02,089 --> 01:36:03,818
No, father. He is
telling the truth.

540
01:36:03,924 --> 01:36:06,654
You fool. You don't
know these conmen.

541
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:11,527
Ask him and see. Will
he marry you?

542
01:36:16,436 --> 01:36:20,930
Sir.. will you marry me?

543
01:36:24,778 --> 01:36:29,408
Yes, Madhu, if you
father allows us.

544
01:37:32,012 --> 01:37:33,570
I want that girl, that's it.

545
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:36,410
Sir.. this matter is not easy.

546
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:41,917
Silence! Get the girl
in anyway you can.

547
01:37:42,022 --> 01:37:44,081
Sir, there is one way for it.

548
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:46,489
The fair in Chandanpur
is about to start.

549
01:37:51,531 --> 01:37:53,761
..this work will be
done in a jiffy.

550
01:37:55,068 --> 01:37:56,763
It will be arranged for.

551
01:38:04,544 --> 01:38:06,512
Give it to me, daughter
give me the bag.

552
01:38:06,613 --> 01:38:08,444
Come quickly, father.

553
01:38:12,052 --> 01:38:13,451
And the, even I am in haste.

554
01:38:17,658 --> 01:38:18,852
And listen..

555
01:38:21,662 --> 01:38:23,857
Whatever you feel like, dad.

556
01:38:34,174 --> 01:38:35,539
If only your brother
was alive today.

557
01:38:38,578 --> 01:38:40,876
Okay. Okay, I will bring them.

558
01:38:54,661 --> 01:38:56,492
All the arrangements
are done too.

559
01:38:59,599 --> 01:39:01,499
I won't be here for
a couple of days.

560
01:39:01,601 --> 01:39:03,660
And it is necessay to
go to Neelpur too.

561
01:39:03,770 --> 01:39:06,000
Tell me, how can I help you?

562
01:39:11,011 --> 01:39:12,035
But your majesty..

563
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:15,908
Please go as soon as possible.

564
01:39:16,016 --> 01:39:18,849
Very good. Farewell.
- Farewell.

565
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:33,599
No.. I won't let you go.

566
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:36,266
Why won't you let me go?

567
01:39:36,636 --> 01:39:39,127
I feel so scared without you.

568
01:39:42,042 --> 01:39:43,942
No. Not kind of fear, sir.

569
01:39:55,655 --> 01:39:59,284
Listen. You don't worry
about the king.

570
01:39:59,860 --> 01:40:02,727
He has gone with his
friends for a hunt.

571
01:40:02,829 --> 01:40:06,162
And I will return
before he does.

572
01:40:06,666 --> 01:40:09,157
See.. I am going now.

573
01:40:13,673 --> 01:40:16,574
Please smile a little.. please..

574
01:41:11,064 --> 01:41:13,225
The flower has fallen down.

575
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:14,698
So what if the flower
has fallen down?

576
01:41:15,068 --> 01:41:17,298
It is very inauspicious.

577
01:41:17,737 --> 01:41:21,229
If someone's flower
falls down, he dies.

578
01:41:24,144 --> 01:41:26,635
No, this is the truth.

579
01:41:26,847 --> 01:41:28,815
I don't want to die.

580
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:33,854
I wasn't scared of death
before seeing you.

581
01:41:48,768 --> 01:41:53,330
God.. I amn't even
married till now.

582
01:42:02,782 --> 01:42:04,750
Here, you are married now.

583
01:42:15,795 --> 01:42:17,763
God is a witness.

584
01:43:08,048 --> 01:43:10,744
Today you have Charan
drink so much..

585
01:43:10,850 --> 01:43:12,283
Don't worry, sir.

586
01:43:12,385 --> 01:43:13,750
I will have him drink so much..

587
01:43:13,853 --> 01:43:15,753
..he won't come to his
senses till two days.

588
01:43:15,855 --> 01:43:17,083
Very good.

589
01:43:27,067 --> 01:43:28,091
Oh!

590
01:43:28,201 --> 01:43:29,759
Too bad!

591
01:43:30,136 --> 01:43:31,364
Should I get more?

592
01:43:31,471 --> 01:43:35,373
No. I have drunk a lot.
Not a drop more.

593
01:46:02,288 --> 01:46:06,315
''Someone likes green
green notes.''

594
01:46:06,426 --> 01:46:10,522
''Someone likes boot,
suit and coat.''

595
01:46:20,039 --> 01:46:24,339
''Friends.. I like drinks..''

596
01:46:51,604 --> 01:46:53,970
Charan.. it is a problem.

597
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:57,173
A problem? I didn't sing fully.

598
01:46:57,677 --> 01:47:00,237
If I sang fully, it
would be better.

599
01:47:00,346 --> 01:47:01,973
Charan, there is
a major problem.

600
01:47:02,081 --> 01:47:03,378
Sir has met with an accident.

601
01:47:03,483 --> 01:47:05,576
Yes. He is very injured.
- Where is he?

602
01:47:07,687 --> 01:47:09,518
He is taking Madhu's name.

603
01:47:12,692 --> 01:47:14,159
Okay.

604
01:47:31,110 --> 01:47:32,168
What happened, Charan?

605
01:47:34,113 --> 01:47:36,343
He is badly injured.
- Injured?

606
01:47:39,118 --> 01:47:40,176
Where is he?

607
01:47:40,286 --> 01:47:41,310
He is in his majesty's bungalow.

608
01:47:41,421 --> 01:47:42,513
Why is he there?

609
01:47:42,622 --> 01:47:43,680
He had gone to his office.

610
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:45,417
The police chief has
brought him there.

611
01:47:45,525 --> 01:47:47,356
He is taking your name
again and again.

612
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:49,018
Come on, quickly.

613
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:16,388
Sir..

614
01:48:23,162 --> 01:48:27,792
How is sir? Is it him? Sir..

615
01:50:02,261 --> 01:50:03,558
Madhu..

616
01:50:03,663 --> 01:50:05,824
Please give me some
drinking water..

617
01:50:11,270 --> 01:50:13,238
Madhu..

618
01:50:14,340 --> 01:50:16,240
Madhu..

619
01:50:28,621 --> 01:50:30,589
Madhu..

620
01:50:39,298 --> 01:50:41,266
Madhu..

621
01:50:53,513 --> 01:50:55,606
Sir.. where is Madhu?

622
01:50:55,715 --> 01:50:56,739
Why? Where did she go?

623
01:51:01,654 --> 01:51:02,746
And she isn't there.

624
01:51:04,991 --> 01:51:07,221
No. I myself am returning
from Neelpur.

625
01:51:07,427 --> 01:51:08,451
I had gone there for two days.

626
01:51:08,561 --> 01:51:10,825
Then she surely is
in some problem.

627
01:51:11,330 --> 01:51:13,230
Shall we search for her?

628
01:51:14,333 --> 01:51:16,301
Come on.

629
01:51:19,338 --> 01:51:21,306
Madhu..

630
01:51:29,348 --> 01:51:31,248
Madhu..

631
01:51:31,350 --> 01:51:33,250
Madhu..

632
01:51:41,561 --> 01:51:43,586
Madhu..

633
01:51:59,579 --> 01:52:01,342
What happened?

634
01:52:05,384 --> 01:52:06,681
What happened?

635
01:52:06,786 --> 01:52:08,811
Looking for her is useless.

636
01:52:26,506 --> 01:52:28,474
Madhu..

637
01:52:38,518 --> 01:52:47,392
Come.. o foreigner..

638
01:53:15,855 --> 01:53:17,345
Madhu..

639
01:53:18,791 --> 01:53:20,759
Where is Madhu?

640
01:53:23,462 --> 01:53:25,430
Where is Madhu now?

641
01:53:25,731 --> 01:53:28,700
I heard her voice.
Didn't you hear it?

642
01:53:29,468 --> 01:53:30,901
No.

643
01:53:31,804 --> 01:53:33,431
Come.. I am waiting for you..

644
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:42,548
''Come..''

645
01:53:47,486 --> 01:53:49,977
Did you hear that?

646
01:53:54,493 --> 01:53:56,552
Where, sir?

647
01:53:56,662 --> 01:53:59,130
Didn't you hear anything?

648
01:54:00,499 --> 01:54:05,527
No. this is just your
misconception.

649
01:55:42,802 --> 01:55:44,827
Sir..

650
01:55:44,937 --> 01:55:46,564
Sir.. have you come sir?

651
01:55:46,672 --> 01:55:50,506
It is all my fault.
You can punish me.

652
01:55:50,609 --> 01:55:52,042
Why? What did you do?

653
01:55:52,144 --> 01:55:53,907
Veer Singh told me
that you have..

654
01:55:59,985 --> 01:56:01,543
But the king wasn't
there at all.

655
01:56:01,587 --> 01:56:02,747
No, sir.

656
01:56:02,955 --> 01:56:05,856
I have found out that
all that was false.

657
01:56:09,028 --> 01:56:10,996
He didn't go anywhere at all.

658
01:56:21,841 --> 01:56:31,944
''Your heart cannot be
equal to my heart.''

659
01:56:44,830 --> 01:56:49,767
''I will tell the state
of the heart.''

660
01:56:49,869 --> 01:56:53,168
''Whether you listen
to it or not.'

661
01:57:00,012 --> 01:57:04,574
''A hundred times, I will tell.''

662
01:57:04,683 --> 01:57:08,585
''Whether you will
listen or not.''

663
01:57:28,808 --> 01:57:29,832
Where is Madhu?

664
01:57:29,942 --> 01:57:31,000
Madhu..

665
01:57:31,110 --> 01:57:32,134
Yes, where is she?

666
01:57:32,244 --> 01:57:34,269
What do I know? Get lost..

667
01:57:35,981 --> 01:57:38,609
You wretch.

668
01:57:39,919 --> 01:57:42,945
I know which hunt you went for.

669
01:57:43,055 --> 01:57:46,684
You have molested
an innocent woman.

670
01:57:46,792 --> 01:57:48,783
I will show you.

671
01:57:52,731 --> 01:57:53,789
Tell me..

672
01:58:09,748 --> 01:58:14,811
Tell me where she is,
come on. Tell me.

673
01:58:48,787 --> 01:58:49,879
Veer Singh.

674
01:58:49,989 --> 01:58:51,013
Yes, sir?

675
01:58:51,123 --> 01:58:53,284
Throw this dead body
out of my area.

676
01:58:53,392 --> 01:58:55,360
Very well.

677
01:59:14,813 --> 01:59:16,781
Wait, you wretch.

678
01:59:21,820 --> 01:59:23,788
Come on!

679
01:59:28,928 --> 01:59:30,793
Where are you taking the sir?

680
01:59:30,896 --> 01:59:32,124
I say, let me go.

681
01:59:32,231 --> 01:59:34,461
And I say, get down.

682
01:59:39,338 --> 01:59:41,329
I have to settle old
accounts with you.

683
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:43,738
Not one, but many. Get down!

684
02:00:27,886 --> 02:00:29,854
Where are you taking
the vehicle?

685
02:00:47,172 --> 02:00:54,305
Here you are.. and this
too.. and this too.

686
02:00:54,413 --> 02:00:56,472
And this too.

687
02:02:05,984 --> 02:02:07,952
What happened?

688
02:02:10,055 --> 02:02:11,886
She didn't come.

689
02:02:11,990 --> 02:02:13,048
Who didn't come?

690
02:02:13,158 --> 02:02:14,955
The one who was to.

691
02:02:15,327 --> 02:02:17,488
The one who was to didn't come?

692
02:02:17,996 --> 02:02:19,395
What is the problem?

693
02:02:23,001 --> 02:02:24,559
And now I am almost ill.

694
02:02:24,670 --> 02:02:26,399
Okay, come on.

695
02:02:32,010 --> 02:02:33,978
Careful.. careful..

696
02:02:35,114 --> 02:02:37,639
Take it carefully.
Take it carefully.

697
02:02:48,026 --> 02:02:50,517
But not with your heart.

698
02:02:51,296 --> 02:02:54,094
I will find you under
any circumstances.

699
02:03:00,038 --> 02:03:01,266
What is it?

700
02:03:01,373 --> 02:03:02,601
Ruined.

701
02:03:06,044 --> 02:03:07,102
How is that?

702
02:03:07,212 --> 02:03:09,339
When I took the tea
and went inside..

703
02:03:12,117 --> 02:03:14,017
I don't know what has
happened to him.

704
02:03:15,053 --> 02:03:16,953
I know what has happened to him.

705
02:03:17,055 --> 02:03:18,113
Should I tell you?

706
02:03:18,223 --> 02:03:20,020
Yes.
- Should I?

707
02:03:20,125 --> 02:03:22,958
Will you tell me or
should I hit you?

708
02:03:23,061 --> 02:03:24,289
A ghost..

709
02:03:24,396 --> 02:03:27,126
Not on you, but on your sir.

710
02:03:27,232 --> 02:03:29,632
On sir.. what should we do now?

711
02:03:30,068 --> 02:03:31,968
Give me a bidi.

712
02:03:39,478 --> 02:03:40,502
Will you come with me?

713
02:03:40,612 --> 02:03:41,977
Come on. Come on right now.

714
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:44,378
Will you be scared?

715
02:03:44,483 --> 02:03:46,474
I will be scared!

716
02:03:48,086 --> 02:03:51,055
I don't know what the
meaning of fear is.

717
02:04:02,100 --> 02:04:04,159
Come in.

718
02:04:34,132 --> 02:04:36,100
Don't sit here.

719
02:04:37,135 --> 02:04:39,228
Someone else is sitting here.

720
02:04:40,138 --> 02:04:41,435
There is nobody here.

721
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:43,201
Will you ever do anything
like this?

722
02:04:43,308 --> 02:04:45,435
Hold your ears.

723
02:04:45,544 --> 02:04:48,536
Sit down. Get up.

724
02:04:48,647 --> 02:04:50,046
Get up.

725
02:04:50,148 --> 02:04:52,309
Sit down. Go.

726
02:04:53,352 --> 02:04:55,115
You will not go?

727
02:04:55,220 --> 02:04:57,211
I tell you, go away silently.

728
02:04:59,324 --> 02:05:01,224
You won't go?

729
02:05:01,326 --> 02:05:03,726
Okay, wait.

730
02:05:09,434 --> 02:05:11,595
Oh! He has started burning!

731
02:05:16,375 --> 02:05:17,399
Is he behind me?

732
02:05:17,509 --> 02:05:19,477
Sit down.

733
02:05:19,578 --> 02:05:20,602
What is the matter?

734
02:05:24,583 --> 02:05:26,141
So what should I do?

735
02:05:32,190 --> 02:05:34,488
I mean, a witch.
She is very bad.

736
02:05:34,593 --> 02:05:36,686
If she very bad, I
am the son of bad.

737
02:05:36,795 --> 02:05:39,093
Son or father?
- Father!

738
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:44,259
But your skull?
- Take it and come.

739
02:06:03,221 --> 02:06:06,122
Go.. go and call your employer.

740
02:06:06,224 --> 02:06:08,624
Employer of ghost?
- The employer..

741
02:06:14,333 --> 02:06:19,737
Sir.. sir.. nothing.

742
02:06:25,344 --> 02:06:27,539
Is it? Then close the door.

743
02:06:39,591 --> 02:06:41,559
Louder.. Baba..

744
02:06:44,262 --> 02:06:46,230
Louder.. Baba..

745
02:06:55,273 --> 02:06:57,332
Did you see?
- No.

746
02:07:00,278 --> 02:07:01,711
Or else, he won't go.

747
02:07:04,783 --> 02:07:05,841
Give it to me.

748
02:07:08,286 --> 02:07:09,344
Twenty five paise..

749
02:07:10,956 --> 02:07:12,184
That is not my responsibility.

750
02:07:12,290 --> 02:07:13,848
Where did sir go?

751
02:07:23,635 --> 02:07:26,195
You dangerous! Tell
me where is sir..

752
02:07:26,304 --> 02:07:28,704
..or else I will smash
your head down.

753
02:07:33,311 --> 02:07:35,541
See. He has become a cat.

754
02:07:36,314 --> 02:07:38,214
But why are you running
like a dog?

755
02:08:38,710 --> 02:08:40,803
Where were you, Madhu?

756
02:08:40,912 --> 02:08:43,278
I had gone crazy searching
for you.

757
02:08:44,382 --> 02:08:46,282
Why are you staring
at me like this?

758
02:08:46,384 --> 02:08:49,785
Come closer to me. Come to me.

759
02:08:54,593 --> 02:08:57,687
Brother.. brother..

760
02:08:57,796 --> 02:08:59,286
This was Madhavi's voice,
isn't it?

761
02:08:59,397 --> 02:09:00,455
Yes. It was her voice.

762
02:09:00,565 --> 02:09:01,623
Is she in some trouble?

763
02:09:01,733 --> 02:09:03,360
Trouble? You mean a tiger?

764
02:09:03,468 --> 02:09:04,560
My gun.. my gun..

765
02:09:04,669 --> 02:09:06,637
You search here, I
will search there.

766
02:09:07,606 --> 02:09:09,631
Madhavi, where are you?

767
02:09:09,741 --> 02:09:12,801
Sir.. sir..

768
02:09:14,513 --> 02:09:18,313
Brother.. brother..

769
02:09:18,850 --> 02:09:20,818
Madhavi, where are you?

770
02:09:23,522 --> 02:09:25,490
Why are you running
from me, Madhu?

771
02:09:25,590 --> 02:09:27,649
Who is Madhu? I am not Madhu.

772
02:09:27,759 --> 02:09:28,817
No, don't say like this.

773
02:09:28,927 --> 02:09:30,656
Say that you have forgotten
your father.

774
02:09:30,762 --> 02:09:32,491
That you don't love
me any longer.

775
02:09:32,597 --> 02:09:33,723
You have some misconception.

776
02:09:33,832 --> 02:09:37,495
Please let me go. Please
let me go. Brother..

777
02:09:42,641 --> 02:09:46,543
I wasn't insulting
anyone. I was..

778
02:09:53,652 --> 02:09:55,517
Hey.. what is this?

779
02:09:58,456 --> 02:09:59,684
My name is Anand.

780
02:09:59,791 --> 02:10:01,349
Should I splatter
your brains out?

781
02:10:01,459 --> 02:10:03,427
He seems to be crazy. Run away!

782
02:10:06,064 --> 02:10:07,361
He is the police chief
of this area.

783
02:10:07,465 --> 02:10:09,763
And I am his brother-in-law.

784
02:10:11,670 --> 02:10:12,694
Where do you reside?

785
02:10:12,804 --> 02:10:14,362
I live in the Dak Bungalow.

786
02:10:14,472 --> 02:10:16,372
In the Bungalow..

787
02:10:18,009 --> 02:10:20,477
He has ruined the
whole picnic today.

788
02:10:20,579 --> 02:10:22,376
Come on, Ms. Madhavi.

789
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:24,448
Come on. Madhavi.

790
02:10:41,766 --> 02:10:43,393
Come on, forget it.

791
02:10:45,503 --> 02:10:46,731
Brother.. look at this.

792
02:10:46,838 --> 02:10:48,567
Yes, Madhavi. This is strange.

793
02:10:48,673 --> 02:10:51,005
This picture is similar to you.

794
02:10:52,510 --> 02:10:55,138
But he never saw me before this.

795
02:10:58,016 --> 02:11:00,143
Yes. It is possible.

796
02:11:00,518 --> 02:11:02,418
It is seen sometimes..

797
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:04,420
..that even when there
is no relation..

798
02:11:04,522 --> 02:11:06,422
..the faces of two people
are so similar..

799
02:11:06,524 --> 02:11:08,424
..that even the police
are stunned.

800
02:11:08,526 --> 02:11:10,960
Then the poor man wasn't lying.

801
02:11:11,529 --> 02:11:13,497
He should get this picture..

802
02:11:13,598 --> 02:11:14,826
The poor man?

803
02:11:28,546 --> 02:11:37,614
''The broken dreams
have taught us..''

804
02:11:37,722 --> 02:11:43,661
''Who had been achieved
by the heart.''

805
02:11:43,762 --> 02:11:48,461
''The eyes have lost her.''

806
02:12:25,804 --> 02:12:29,672
''I keep searching for her.''

807
02:12:47,158 --> 02:12:51,527
''The guest of my heart.''

808
02:12:55,834 --> 02:13:00,533
''What my ambition was.''

809
02:13:00,638 --> 02:13:04,540
''What has come to be done.''

810
02:14:21,920 --> 02:14:31,227
'' But even this yearning
is useless.''

811
02:15:13,771 --> 02:15:15,739
Does anyone named
Anand live here?

812
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:17,068
What can I tell you, madam?

813
02:15:20,778 --> 02:15:23,076
This poor man is a thief
of just cooking.

814
02:15:23,181 --> 02:15:25,206
Even that, I have to eat.

815
02:15:25,884 --> 02:15:28,876
Neither is sir here, and
nor is his bearer.

816
02:15:42,066 --> 02:15:44,034
Excuse me.

817
02:15:44,802 --> 02:15:45,860
Charan..

818
02:15:45,970 --> 02:15:47,096
You don't speak with me.

819
02:15:47,205 --> 02:15:48,229
What are you saying?

820
02:15:48,339 --> 02:15:49,363
Thief, fool, rogue, wretch..

821
02:15:49,474 --> 02:15:50,702
You are a thief, your
father is a thief.

822
02:15:52,410 --> 02:15:54,105
You ruined my money yesterday.

823
02:15:56,814 --> 02:15:58,111
You wretch. Where is the ghost?

824
02:16:04,822 --> 02:16:06,722
Me.. no.. me.. no..

825
02:16:06,824 --> 02:16:08,052
What happened?

826
02:16:08,159 --> 02:16:09,717
No..

827
02:16:09,928 --> 02:16:11,725
Move.

828
02:16:28,112 --> 02:16:29,739
Madhavi..

829
02:16:29,847 --> 02:16:31,940
Is it?

830
02:16:33,851 --> 02:16:38,151
I will touch you, okay..

831
02:16:38,256 --> 02:16:40,747
The same nose, the
same features.

832
02:16:40,858 --> 02:16:42,826
That same mouth and
those same eyes.

833
02:16:44,862 --> 02:16:48,298
So sir had thought
you to be Madhu.

834
02:16:48,866 --> 02:16:53,303
Okay, tell me. Who
is this Madhu?

835
02:16:53,871 --> 02:16:55,099
What has happened to her?

836
02:17:11,889 --> 02:17:14,289
This is the poor
girl's sad story.

837
02:17:20,898 --> 02:17:23,799
Looking at you, now
I have understood..

838
02:18:00,138 --> 02:18:02,163
Has sir come?

839
02:19:19,016 --> 02:19:20,984
Mr. Anand..

840
02:19:25,022 --> 02:19:26,319
I know.

841
02:19:26,424 --> 02:19:28,449
I have heard everything.

842
02:19:33,364 --> 02:19:35,264
I feel that..

843
02:19:36,033 --> 02:19:39,264
That Madhu's sorrow is mine now.

844
02:19:55,052 --> 02:19:57,020
Don't spend any tears on me.

845
02:20:02,193 --> 02:20:05,629
Those eyes, that face.

846
02:20:06,330 --> 02:20:08,457
That look.

847
02:20:23,080 --> 02:20:28,985
''Come..''

848
02:20:30,288 --> 02:20:33,985
''O foreigner..''

849
02:20:39,096 --> 02:20:41,155
Are you hearing it?
- What?

850
02:20:42,366 --> 02:20:44,334
She is calling me.

851
02:20:45,436 --> 02:20:46,994
Where are you going?

852
02:20:48,206 --> 02:20:53,610
Madhu.. Madhu..

853
02:21:05,156 --> 02:21:07,624
I am living with you.

854
02:21:07,725 --> 02:21:09,090
I had promised you.

855
02:21:09,193 --> 02:21:14,631
I have won, he has lost.

856
02:21:22,540 --> 02:21:24,371
Who is it?

857
02:21:24,475 --> 02:21:26,443
Ugranarayan.

858
02:21:27,245 --> 02:21:29,110
Ugranarayan.

859
02:21:29,247 --> 02:21:32,444
He wanted to bite me that day.

860
02:21:32,550 --> 02:21:34,575
Anand.. Anand..

861
02:21:34,685 --> 02:21:36,710
Madhu.. Madhu..

862
02:21:44,161 --> 02:21:45,219
I am going.

863
02:21:45,329 --> 02:21:47,058
Where?

864
02:21:47,164 --> 02:21:50,463
His hands have my Madhu's blood.

865
02:21:50,568 --> 02:21:52,661
And that snake is alive yet.

866
02:21:52,770 --> 02:21:54,601
Whom are you speaking about?

867
02:21:54,705 --> 02:21:58,573
Ugranarayan. Ugranarayan.

868
02:22:02,179 --> 02:22:05,148
Ugranarayan. I know that wretch.

869
02:22:05,449 --> 02:22:07,076
There have been a
couple of murders..

870
02:22:07,184 --> 02:22:08,276
..earlier, and he has
had an hand in them.

871
02:22:12,189 --> 02:22:14,680
Why don't you arrest
him, inspector?

872
02:22:14,792 --> 02:22:16,817
Didn't I tell you
my helplessness?

873
02:22:17,662 --> 02:22:20,426
I cannot do anything
without proof.

874
02:22:22,199 --> 02:22:23,496
Hello?

875
02:22:23,601 --> 02:22:25,831
Hello, Kamal.. yes..

876
02:22:29,607 --> 02:22:31,632
There are still a full
fifteen minutes left.

877
02:22:32,209 --> 02:22:34,507
I will come there
directly from here.

878
02:22:34,612 --> 02:22:36,603
Ciao..

879
02:22:42,219 --> 02:22:47,122
Wait. Give me the pistol.
Give it to me.

880
02:22:48,492 --> 02:22:50,653
Please give the pistol
to me for two days.

881
02:22:51,228 --> 02:22:53,526
I will kill the
sinner with this.

882
02:22:53,631 --> 02:22:55,531
Hang me after that if you wish.

883
02:22:55,633 --> 02:22:57,624
Just my revenge should
be completed.

884
02:23:04,508 --> 02:23:06,135
Listen..

885
02:23:11,248 --> 02:23:13,148
Then find some solid
proof for it.

886
02:23:13,250 --> 02:23:15,548
I will help you.

887
02:23:17,254 --> 02:23:18,551
Where are you going?

888
02:23:18,656 --> 02:23:19,680
I don't know.

889
02:23:19,790 --> 02:23:22,657
Come with me.
- Where? - Come on.

890
02:23:38,376 --> 02:23:41,345
Hello.
- Hello, inspector.

891
02:23:41,445 --> 02:23:43,242
You are very late.

892
02:23:43,347 --> 02:23:45,508
Yes, we were late due
to the office work.

893
02:24:59,356 --> 02:25:05,989
''Oh.. the scorpion..''

894
02:25:45,402 --> 02:25:48,803
'' Beloved, please come home.''

895
02:25:54,478 --> 02:25:56,912
The proof is in your presence.

896
02:25:57,414 --> 02:25:59,314
What are you saying?

897
02:25:59,416 --> 02:26:01,384
I didn't understand.

898
02:26:07,424 --> 02:26:11,724
..then even he will
be stunned like me.

899
02:26:15,766 --> 02:26:17,734
What will happen then?

900
02:26:26,610 --> 02:26:31,343
Madhavidevi.. this
is my last request.

901
02:26:31,782 --> 02:26:34,080
Please help me..

902
02:26:35,786 --> 02:26:37,754
Brother..

903
02:26:39,657 --> 02:26:41,352
When will we have to go?

904
02:26:41,458 --> 02:26:44,689
I will tell you
when I come back.

905
02:26:46,463 --> 02:26:49,864
Sir, you are with me?

906
02:26:49,967 --> 02:26:52,765
It is the law's duty
to be with you.

907
02:28:06,543 --> 02:28:08,511
You are sitting here?

908
02:28:08,612 --> 02:28:10,637
What have you come to do here?

909
02:28:11,548 --> 02:28:12,947
I had come to apologize to you.

910
02:28:13,050 --> 02:28:15,109
What did you want
to apologize for?

911
02:28:20,057 --> 02:28:22,617
I wanted to apologize
to you for them.

912
02:28:29,566 --> 02:28:31,864
And you see what the
result of that is.

913
02:28:31,969 --> 02:28:33,459
I don't have anything
to eat or wear.

914
02:28:33,570 --> 02:28:35,538
I am tired of life.

915
02:28:47,918 --> 02:28:49,886
Make he do some work.

916
02:28:49,987 --> 02:28:52,012
Your pride isn't broken as yet.

917
02:28:55,592 --> 02:28:58,026
I will make these pictures.

918
02:29:04,601 --> 02:29:06,899
Come some time else.

919
02:29:10,874 --> 02:29:12,842
Your majesty..

920
02:29:18,015 --> 02:29:19,915
But I don't have
time in the day.

921
02:29:21,218 --> 02:29:23,186
When you will have some time.

922
02:29:26,123 --> 02:29:31,686
Okay. I will leave
now. Thank you.

923
02:29:41,638 --> 02:29:42,935
Here you are.

924
02:29:47,644 --> 02:29:49,612
You will come, won't you?

925
02:29:51,915 --> 02:29:53,940
I asked Charan and
had these made..

926
02:29:54,051 --> 02:29:57,282
..exactly as Madhu had
worn that night.

927
02:29:58,655 --> 02:29:59,713
But..

928
02:29:59,823 --> 02:30:00,881
The road to Shampur is very bad.

929
02:30:00,991 --> 02:30:02,151
You will come with her,
isn't it? - Yes.

930
02:30:02,259 --> 02:30:03,556
Okay, I will leave now.

931
02:30:05,329 --> 02:30:07,058
Madhavi.. please arrange
for some tea.

932
02:30:07,164 --> 02:30:08,563
No. please don't
take the trouble.

933
02:30:13,003 --> 02:30:14,903
I cannot wait here
for even a minute.

934
02:30:15,005 --> 02:30:16,563
But..

935
02:30:19,009 --> 02:30:20,977
Yes, I will.

936
02:30:24,014 --> 02:30:25,572
Poor man.

937
02:30:40,697 --> 02:30:42,756
Very well.

938
02:31:10,828 --> 02:31:12,796
It is such a dangerous night.

939
02:31:15,899 --> 02:31:17,867
Do your work silently.

940
02:31:29,246 --> 02:31:32,807
Behind me.. where? Who is it?

941
02:31:41,758 --> 02:31:44,056
Anand.. you wanted to scare me?

942
02:31:44,161 --> 02:31:45,992
No. I myself was scared,
your majesty.

943
02:31:46,096 --> 02:31:48,326
I don't have time
to waste. Quickly.

944
02:31:49,766 --> 02:31:52,667
There isn't more time for eight.

945
02:31:52,769 --> 02:31:54,737
Do your work quietly.

946
02:31:59,109 --> 02:32:02,670
Your majesty, blood.
- Blood? - Yes, blood.

947
02:32:09,119 --> 02:32:10,848
Come here, look at this.

948
02:32:20,197 --> 02:32:22,757
There is someone else's
hand in this blood.

949
02:32:22,866 --> 02:32:26,768
But who else is there
other than us here?

950
02:32:26,870 --> 02:32:29,703
There is someone here.
I can feel it.

951
02:32:31,008 --> 02:32:32,771
Did you hear that noise?

952
02:32:36,813 --> 02:32:37,905
You are listening
to it, isn't it?

953
02:32:38,015 --> 02:32:39,710
I can't listen to anything else.

954
02:32:40,083 --> 02:32:42,051
Make the picture.

955
02:33:09,179 --> 02:33:10,237
Were you scared?

956
02:33:10,347 --> 02:33:12,406
No. not at all.

957
02:33:17,854 --> 02:33:19,822
How are you staring at me?

958
02:33:19,923 --> 02:33:21,823
Just like a painter looks.

959
02:33:24,861 --> 02:33:26,920
..self out of his subject.

960
02:33:27,030 --> 02:33:30,761
Your majesty, do you
believe in spirits?

961
02:33:30,867 --> 02:33:32,835
Why are you asking
me such questions?

962
02:33:32,936 --> 02:33:35,097
The night is something
like that.

963
02:33:35,872 --> 02:33:40,275
It seems that a spirit,
whose dream..

964
02:33:44,214 --> 02:33:47,843
Do you see those
dancing shadows?

965
02:34:24,921 --> 02:34:26,889
What kind of noise is this?

966
02:34:34,131 --> 02:34:35,223
Who is that?

967
02:34:35,332 --> 02:34:38,233
Anand.. light.. light.. Anand..

968
02:34:59,289 --> 02:35:02,588
Don't move ahead. Go away.

969
02:35:04,294 --> 02:35:06,023
I tell you, go away from here.

970
02:35:06,129 --> 02:35:08,256
Anand.. tell her to go away.

971
02:35:10,967 --> 02:35:12,935
Why are you scared today?

972
02:35:13,970 --> 02:35:16,268
Do you remember that
stormy night..

973
02:35:16,373 --> 02:35:19,365
..when you called
me here giving..

974
02:35:19,476 --> 02:35:22,079
..me the false message
that he is wounded?

975
02:35:22,079 --> 02:35:24,274
What happened after that?

976
02:35:24,981 --> 02:35:26,949
Tell me, what happened
after that?

977
02:35:29,252 --> 02:35:31,277
Why are you silent?

978
02:35:39,429 --> 02:35:41,897
I tried to force myself on you.

979
02:35:42,099 --> 02:35:44,294
You saved yourself
from my clutches..

980
02:36:29,045 --> 02:36:30,103
Don't you dare.

981
02:36:33,550 --> 02:36:34,949
Killing a innocent woman..

982
02:36:35,051 --> 02:36:37,451
You will never have any peace.

983
02:37:09,085 --> 02:37:11,315
So that nobody knows.

984
02:37:19,362 --> 02:37:22,058
Is there anyone? Light.. light..

985
02:37:28,104 --> 02:37:29,162
You are under arrest.

986
02:37:29,272 --> 02:37:30,330
All this is lies, this
is a conspiracy.

987
02:37:34,511 --> 02:37:36,604
You can say everything
else in the court.

988
02:37:41,117 --> 02:37:43,085
Guards.. take the gun.

989
02:38:25,362 --> 02:38:27,660
But how do you know all this?

990
02:38:48,251 --> 02:38:50,685
Where are you going,
Madhavidevi?

991
02:38:54,190 --> 02:38:57,159
Brother.. it is eight.
I will go.

992
02:39:02,732 --> 02:39:08,170
Mr. Anand.. Mr. Anand..
I am sorry.

993
02:39:14,411 --> 02:39:16,276
Madhu..

994
02:39:16,379 --> 02:39:17,607
What happened?

995
02:39:24,487 --> 02:39:26,114
She had come.

996
02:39:26,222 --> 02:39:27,450
Who?

997
02:39:27,557 --> 02:39:29,115
Madhu..

998
02:39:29,326 --> 02:39:30,520
Where?

999
02:39:30,627 --> 02:39:31,651
Sir..

1000
02:39:31,761 --> 02:39:33,126
Did you hear that?

1001
02:39:34,431 --> 02:39:36,126
She is calling me.

1002
02:39:36,232 --> 02:39:37,529
Sir.

1003
02:39:40,437 --> 02:39:42,132
Anand..

1004
02:39:42,572 --> 02:39:44,130
Madhavi..

1005
02:39:45,241 --> 02:39:47,209
Sir..

1006
02:39:48,244 --> 02:39:50,212
Anand..

1007
02:39:52,248 --> 02:39:53,647
Madhu..

1008
02:39:53,750 --> 02:39:55,479
Sir..

1009
02:39:58,455 --> 02:40:00,480
Sir..

1010
02:40:01,458 --> 02:40:03,483
Anand..

1011
02:40:05,261 --> 02:40:06,558
Madhu..

1012
02:40:06,663 --> 02:40:14,337
''Come.. I have been waiting
at this bank..''

1013
02:40:14,337 --> 02:40:20,765
''Oh.. Please come..''

1014
02:40:21,544 --> 02:40:31,920
''Come.. o foreigner..''

1015
02:40:40,497 --> 02:40:43,591
And this was the end
of my last birth.

1016
02:40:44,300 --> 02:40:46,598
I didn't get Madhu
in that birth.

1017
02:40:55,512 --> 02:40:58,606
And in this birth,
I have got her.

1018
02:40:58,715 --> 02:41:01,616
Who. Sister-in-law?
- Yes.

1019
02:41:02,318 --> 02:41:04,218
Our love has taken
birth once again..

1020
02:41:04,320 --> 02:41:06,618
..breaking the darkness
of death.

1021
02:41:07,424 --> 02:41:09,949
And we have taken
birth once again.

1022
02:41:12,328 --> 02:41:14,626
Oh! It is morning.
And we don't know..

1023
02:41:14,731 --> 02:41:17,222
..anything about that
driver. Radha..

1024
02:41:17,333 --> 02:41:19,392
..must be so worried
thinking about us.

1025
02:41:19,502 --> 02:41:20,526
Sir.. sir..

1026
02:41:20,637 --> 02:41:21,729
What? Has the road
been cleared out?

1027
02:41:27,410 --> 02:41:28,434
How do you know that?

1028
02:41:28,545 --> 02:41:30,570
The driver is telling
it downstairs.

1029
02:41:31,347 --> 02:41:33,838
No, this is not possible.
Come on, doctor.

1030
02:42:20,396 --> 02:42:22,364
Radha..

1031
02:42:22,465 --> 02:42:24,365
You are all right.

1032
02:42:24,734 --> 02:42:27,703
I had died listening
about the accident.

1033
02:42:31,508 --> 02:42:33,703
It is as if that I have
got you once again.

1034
02:42:36,412 --> 02:42:38,380
Do you know?

1035
02:42:43,686 --> 02:42:48,521
Oh! I had forgotten!
