1
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,241
One day,
when I was 6 years old,

2
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:07,943
I saw a magnificent picture in a
nature book about the primeval forest.

3
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:11,885
It was a picture of a boa constrictor
swallowing an animal.

4
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:15,549
I'm trying to make a sketch of it
to show you.

5
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,855
Under this splendid picture, it said;

6
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:22,660
"Boa constrictors swallow
their prey whole, without chewing it."

7
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,131
There.

8
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:29,297
"And then remain stationary
for six months digesting it."

9
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,841
I pondered that deeply.

10
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:36,772
And after some work, I succeeded
in making my first drawing.

11
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,512
I called it Drawing Number One.

12
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,951
I showed my masterpiece
to the grownups.

13
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,526
I asked them if it frightened them.

14
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:55,230
Frighten us?
Why should we be frightened of a hat?

15
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:56,933
A hat?

16
00:03:57,136 --> 00:04:00,572
It was a picture of a boa constrictor
digesting an elephant.

17
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,400
Obviously.

18
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,067
Since the grownups were not
able to understand it, I made another,

19
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,975
showing the elephant
inside the boa constrictor,

20
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,911
so they could see it clearly.

21
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,880
My Drawing Number Two.

22
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:19,149
This time, I was told to stop wasting
my time drawing boa constrictors,

23
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,092
whether from the inside or the outside,
and attend to my studies, which I did.

24
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,231
And that is why, at the age of 6,

25
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:30,129
I gave up what might have been
a magnificent career as a painter.

26
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:34,568
As I grew up, whenever I'd meet one
who seemed to be at all clear-sighted,

27
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,710
in order to find out if he was really
a person of true understanding,

28
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:42,745
I would show him my first drawing.
But whoever it was would say;

29
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,248
It's a hat, it's a hat
It's a sort of a kind of hat

30
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,148
Painted poorly
But it surely is a hat

31
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,347
It's a hat, it's a hat
There's no doubt of it, it's a hat

32
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,824
Top of Papa
Is its proper habitat

33
00:04:57,063 --> 00:05:00,464
My, oh, my, look at that
Why, this dummy has drawn a hat

34
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,497
It's a hat, it's a hat
If it's anything, it's a hat

35
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,511
Why, it's nothing but a common
Himalayan mountain hat

36
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:17,979
A hat that looks like down upon
Which someone must've sat

37
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:21,278
Not Picasso or Corot
But a very nice chapeau

38
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:25,116
Are you kidding?
It's a hat, you silly brat

39
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,488
Every grownup was the same
Uniformly, they'd exclaim

40
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:32,062
It's a hat, it's a hat, it's a hat

41
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,530
I could see it wasrt won'th
Spending time with them on earth

42
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:39,034
There were fewer in the sky
I decided I would fly

43
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,569
- It's a hat
- It's a hat

44
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,297
- It's a hat
- It's a hat

45
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,204
It's a hat, it's a hat, it's a hat

46
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,411
I need air

47
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:53,574
Where only stars get in my hair

48
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:58,086
And only eagles stop and stare

49
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,815
I need air

50
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:05,020
All the world is mad
And I have had my share

51
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,222
I need air

52
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:11,096
I need air

53
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,183
I need air

54
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:37,557
One hour of mortal wear and tear

55
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:41,564
Gives my morale moral-de-mer

56
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:06,187
Any corner lot
That heavers got to spare

57
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,257
I need air

58
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,095
I need air

59
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:20,295
There's not a sign of life down there

60
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:24,704
Just hats and grownups everywhere

61
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,378
I need air

62
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:31,744
Lots of cozy sky
That God and I can share

63
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,010
I need air

64
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:40,955
I need air

65
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,494
Over the years,
I came to know many grownups,

66
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,398
and my opinion of them
never improved.

67
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,199
In time, I stopped
showing my drawing

68
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:59,845
and never again mentioned
boa constrictors, elephants or stars.

69
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:04,915
Instead, I would talk about golf,
money, politics and neckties.

70
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:08,848
And everyone was pleased
to have met such a sensible man.

71
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:12,024
So I lived my life alone,

72
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:16,719
without anyone I could really talk to,
until a short time ago.

73
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,363
I was testing a new plane,

74
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:23,057
racing it against the clock
from Paris to India.

75
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,469
Paris calling flight F-BDXY.

76
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:30,870
Paris calling flight F-BDXY.
Come in, please, over.

77
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,840
F-BDXY to Paris.

78
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:37,414
Ground speed: 1 -9-0.
Running ten minutes behind schedule.

79
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,517
Strong headwinds.

80
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,885
Trouble!

81
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,385
- Losing altitude!
- Paris calling flight F-BDXY.

82
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,856
Detail location.
Repeat, detail location.

83
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,323
Detail location.
Repeat, detail location.

84
00:08:55,568 --> 00:09:00,665
Paris calling flight F-BDXY.
Are you there, F-BDXY?

85
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,841
Where are you?

86
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:11,431
If you please,
draw me a sheep.

87
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,608
Will you?

88
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,910
- Will I what?
- Will you draw me a sheep?

89
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,149
Who are...?
Where did you...?

90
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,780
How did you...?

91
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,053
How did you get here?

92
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:44,029
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you to draw me a sheep.

93
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,665
No, no. Listen to me.

94
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,932
- Where did you come from?
- Will you draw me a sheep?

95
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,709
Don't you know any other words?

96
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,678
Is that all you can say?

97
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,574
No.

98
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,657
Will you draw me a sheep?

99
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:23,065
When a mystery is too overpowering,
one doesn't dare disobey.

100
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:26,711
A thousand miles from civilization
and death at my heels,

101
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,972
I picked up a pad and pencil
and began to draw.

102
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,810
Look, I...
I don't know how to draw.

103
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:37,011
- That doesn't matter.
- And I certainly can't draw a sheep.

104
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,548
I've only drawn one thing
in my whole life.

105
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,650
Here.

106
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:47,792
Oh, no. I don't want an elephant
inside a boa constrictor.

107
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,630
A boa constrictor is very dangerous,
and an elephant is very cumbersome.

108
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,898
Where I live, everything is very small.

109
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,838
What I need is a sheep.

110
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,013
Do you live in a small town?
On a small island?

111
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,677
Where is it very small?

112
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,521
What sort of object is that?

113
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,425
- What?
- That.

114
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,054
It's called an aeroplane.
It flies.

115
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,958
I was flying in it,
but it broke down.

116
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,599
Then you must have dropped
from the sky.

117
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,268
That's right.

118
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,035
You too. How funny.

119
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:32,310
If you don't mind, I prefer having
my misfortunes taken seriously.

120
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,749
- What do you mean, "you too"?
- That's a very sick-Iooking sheep.

121
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,579
Is that how you got here?
In a plane that crashed?

122
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,755
Could you make another?

123
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:47,221
- Why?
- Because that one doesn't look well.

124
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:54,826
This is not the way two strangers get to
know each other on the average desert.

125
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,304
This is the way.
Ask me a question.

126
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,497
- Where do you come from?
- Good.

127
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,975
To which I reply,
"I come from Paris."

128
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,874
Now I'll ask you a question.

129
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,747
- Where do you come from?
- Is Paris on this planet?

130
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,250
Of course it's on this planet.

131
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,018
I'm sorry, it won't do.

132
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,989
- Why not?
- See for yourself.

133
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,565
That's not a sheep.
It's a ram. It has horns.

134
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,262
Do you think
this is all I have to do?

135
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:36,771
I have this engine to take apart
and fix before my water runs out.

136
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:41,106
I have no time to draw for a little boy
dressed in a coat, carrying a sword,

137
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,282
who appears from nowhere
in the middle of the Sahara.

138
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,759
There, and that's the last.

139
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,465
There's no horns.

140
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,363
No.

141
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,295
It's not sick.

142
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,200
No.

143
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,370
- Well, then?
- It's old.

144
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,842
I'm sorry.

145
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,598
It's only his box.

146
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,268
The sheep you asked for is inside.

147
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,838
That's perfect,
exactly the way I wanted it.

148
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,172
It is?

149
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,639
Good.

150
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,609
Do you think this sheep
will need a lot of grass?

151
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,946
- Why?
- I told you.

152
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:56,383
Where I come from,
everything is very small.

153
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:59,455
Don't worry.
It's a very small sheep.

154
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,192
This sheep isn't so small.

155
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,959
Alas, I couldn't argue with him.

156
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:14,432
I'd grown too old to see sheep
through the walls of boxes.

157
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,152
Is Paris on this planet?

158
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,023
Of course it is.
Did you forget?

159
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,227
No, I didn't forget.
But why did you ask?

160
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:43,361
- Arert you from this planet?
- The thing that's so good about this box

161
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,538
is, at night,
he can use it as his house.

162
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,840
- He's just going to sleep.
- Oh, sorry.

163
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,764
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

164
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:22,237
Where in God's name
could you have come from?

165
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:34,549
- Do you know what asteroids are?
- What whats are?

166
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,550
- Asteroids.
- No.

167
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,417
They're very, very small planets.

168
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:44,653
The smallest, Asteroid B-61 2,

169
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:47,696
was discovered by a Turkish
astronomer in 1 909.

170
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,962
I think you may live on Asteroid B-61 2.

171
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,702
What do you think?

172
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:03,775
I think you may live on Asteroid B-61 2.

173
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:05,117
What do you think?

174
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,641
What do you think?

175
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,806
Does that mean they also
eat baobab bushes?

176
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:40,579
- Who?
- The sheep.

177
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,991
Do they also eat flowers?

178
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,698
- Do they?
- Just hold it a minute, will you?

179
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:02,671
- Do they also eat flowers?
- What?

180
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,139
Oh, yes, they do.

181
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:08,472
Except the flowers
that have thorns, of course.

182
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,809
No, they even eat the flowers
that have thorns.

183
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,381
But the thorns protect them,
don't they?

184
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:17,384
Maybe from being picked,
but not from being eaten.

185
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:20,615
Then what's the good
of having them?

186
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,524
- Having what?
- Thorns.

187
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,528
I don't know. Spite, I suppose.

188
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,965
Flowers have thorns just for spite.

189
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,998
I don't believe you.

190
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,902
Flowers are weak and helpless,
and they know it.

191
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:41,637
How could they face the world if they
didn't believe they were protected?

192
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,305
- What I'm doing here is important.
- Important?

193
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,611
Flowers have been growing thorns
for millions of years.

194
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:53,154
And for millions of years, sheep have
been eating them just the same.

195
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,486
Eating them.
And you think that's not important?

196
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,788
- Of course it is.
- I know one flower

197
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:03,229
that's unique in all the world.
It grows nowhere but on my planet.

198
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:07,098
But some morning, a sheep can
come along and destroy it

199
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:11,106
with one single bite.
And you think that's not important?

200
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,703
- I suppose so.
- What you don't understand is,

201
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:20,146
that if someone loves one flower
that grows on one star

202
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,685
among all the millions and millions
of stars in the sky,

203
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,756
it's enough to make him happy
to look at the stars.

204
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,486
He can say to himself,
"Somewhere my flower's up there."

205
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,062
But if a sheep eats the flower,

206
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,098
in one moment,
all the stars will go dark.

207
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:39,429
And you think that's not important?

208
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,371
It's not a matter
of consequence to you, is it?

209
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,024
Wait!

210
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,454
Wait! Come back!

211
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:11,226
I most humbly apologize.

212
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,430
I was behaving like a grownup.

213
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,202
Your flower is very important.

214
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,438
I swear it.

215
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,220
Come back!

216
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,851
Please!

217
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,386
Please come back!

218
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:45,534
Where did you go?

219
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,205
Where did you go?
Little man, don't you know

220
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:51,433
That I'm on your side?

221
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:56,205
Why did you go?

222
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,940
Why did you go?
Little man, let me show you

223
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,312
I'm on your side

224
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,455
This world

225
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:10,151
Is an ocean without any shore
When you're on your own

226
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:14,389
Dawn is the end of the rope
When you're all alone

227
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,864
I've been, I've seen
I've known it

228
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:23,133
Where can you be?

229
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,810
Where can you be?
Hurry back, and you'll see

230
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,809
That I'm on your side

231
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:33,542
Where did you run?

232
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,084
Why did you run
From the one, only one

233
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,587
Who is on your side?

234
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,986
Everybody needs a friend

235
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,628
Come make use of me

236
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,230
God gave people hands to lend

237
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,332
Mine are free

238
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:54,801
So why stay away?

239
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,735
Come what may

240
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,376
I'm on

241
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:05,414
Your side

242
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,154
I missed him.

243
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:19,228
I wished I'd discovered
more about him.

244
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:22,823
But he'd gone and taken
his mystery with him.

245
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,665
Unaccustomed as I am
to drawing anything

246
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,203
but boa constrictors and elephants,

247
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,500
I decided to make a portrait of him

248
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,904
so that I wouldn't forget him.

249
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:35,477
After all, he was a friend.

250
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,046
And not everyone has a friend.

251
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:40,651
Least of all me.

252
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:43,612
I'm hungry.

253
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,457
I have your supper right here.

254
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,995
I waited as long as I could.

255
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:03,032
I'd advise saving some
of that till tomorrow.

256
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,837
That is, of course,
unless you're very hungry.

257
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,377
Is this all you have?

258
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,641
Well, at the moment, yes.

259
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:17,210
This will be quite enough,
thank you.

260
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:30,658
Needless to say,
that problem you outlined,

261
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,996
concerning the flower you know.

262
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:36,834
The one on the star,
and your sheep...

263
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:40,672
In fact, all flowers
and all sheep, that's...

264
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,411
That's extremely important.

265
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,213
In fact, I can't think of anything
that's more important.

266
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:52,813
Well, I've been giving it
a great deal of thought, and I...

267
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:56,721
I think I've come up with a solution
that will remove your flower

268
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,624
from any possibility of danger.

269
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,524
Now, this is my plan.

270
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:05,601
But this is subject
to your approval, of course.

271
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:09,839
One, to draw a muzzle
for your sheep.

272
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,909
Two...

273
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:16,410
If you can describe your planet
to me in sufficient detail

274
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,674
for me to make a drawing of it,

275
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:22,251
I'll put up a big, strong fence
all around your flower.

276
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,384
Would you really do that?

277
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:40,471
Smaller.

278
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,006
Smaller.

279
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,604
I have three volcanoes.

280
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:17,400
- How big are they?
- Very big.

281
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,442
- Compared to you?
- Knee-high.

282
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:24,480
I have to clean them out every day.

283
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:28,016
- All by yourself?
- There's no one else.

284
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,383
There are three baobab bushes.

285
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:36,322
You don't have to draw them.
They don't come up for a while.

286
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,860
- Where's your house?
- On the other side.

287
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,498
You don't have to draw that either.

288
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,033
And my flower lives on this side here.

289
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:01,544
When she first came
through the ground,

290
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:04,586
I was afraid she was going
to be a baobab,

291
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,848
but then she blossomed.

292
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,456
One bright, yellow morning,
she blossomed.

293
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:16,865
- Good morning.
- Stop.

294
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,865
What is it?

295
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:23,006
- Give me a moment to wake up.
- I'm sorry.

296
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,379
How beautiful you are.

297
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:32,777
Yes, I know.

298
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:37,351
I was born at the same moment
as the sun.

299
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,648
- Did you know that?
- No.

300
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:43,322
- Did you know you were quite selfish?
- Selfish?

301
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:45,758
Instead of thinking of my needs,

302
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,762
you're standing there doing
what you want to do,

303
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,332
which is stare at me.

304
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:53,003
- What is it you need?
- Water.

305
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:56,264
- Water?
- I realize this is a small,

306
00:27:56,474 --> 00:28:00,274
- unequipped little planet.
- I'll get it for you right away.

307
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,829
I brought her some water.

308
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,836
I brought it every day.

309
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,340
I did everything I could for her.

310
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,717
It's cooler when the sun goes down.

311
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,519
Do you have a glass bowl
to put over me?

312
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:53,755
That will only make you weaker.
The night air is good for you.

313
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,635
I'm cold!

314
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,998
I'm cold!

315
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,435
You promised me a glass bowl.

316
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,201
It's not cold.

317
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:11,007
- Do you love me?
- Yes, I love you very much.

318
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:13,946
You've made my planet beautiful.

319
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:15,676
I don't believe it.

320
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,685
If you loved me,
you'd know how cold I am.

321
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,621
I promise you, the nights aren't long.
You'll soon get used to it.

322
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,863
- Do you love me?
- I'll get the bowl.

323
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:31,468
I couldn't understand it,
and I couldn't understand her.

324
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:34,638
I loved her,
but I was so unappy.

325
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:40,106
I began to realize
I didn't really understand anything.

326
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:43,144
So I decided to leave my planet

327
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:49,048
and go out into the universe
and try to learn something.

328
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,682
I was wrong to leave her.

329
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:56,259
But at the time,
I didn't even understand that.

330
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,725
I was too young.

331
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:03,892
One morning,
I cleaned out my volcanoes,

332
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:09,665
took one last look for baobabs
and put my planet in order.

333
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,611
Good morning.

334
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,806
- You're all dressed up.
- Yes.

335
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,781
- You look very handsome.
- Thank you.

336
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:25,416
- You're going away, aren't you?
- Yes.

337
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,989
- For a long time?
- Perhaps.

338
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:29,820
I see.

339
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,024
It's my fault you're going,
isn't it?

340
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,993
I've been very foolish,
haven't I?

341
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:41,294
I wonder who will call on me
when you're not here.

342
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,974
There are those two caterpillars,
of course.

343
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,973
I don't like them,
but one has to put up with them

344
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,874
if one wants to meet butterflies.

345
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:53,676
For anything else, I have my thorns.

346
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,315
Well...

347
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,489
...if you're going...

348
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,385
: : : go:

349
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:05,123
- Goodbye.
- Be happy, be happy, be happy

350
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:10,495
Forget that I have no one
And nowhere to go

351
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,694
Be happy, be happy, be happy

352
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:19,002
Don't think of me in winter
All covered with snow

353
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,371
Be happy, be happy

354
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:26,539
Forget that I'll be crying still

355
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:29,185
And never

356
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:35,053
Will be happy

357
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:41,222
Be happy

358
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:47,633
Without you

359
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,115
Stop!

360
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,480
- Where are your papers?
- What papers?

361
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,122
You can't cross the border
without papers.

362
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,417
- What border?
- That border there.

363
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,220
- You need a visa. Do you have one?
- No.

364
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,364
Then you can't cross it.
Those are the rules. Stop!

365
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:50,227
You almost backed
into another country.

366
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:54,269
What are you? A smuggler?
A refugee? An idealist?

367
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,100
- Speak up. What are you?
- I'm ignorant.

368
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,401
Well, you might outgrow it.

369
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,744
Now, look...

370
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:04,540
My country is too small
for both of us,

371
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:07,479
but I have a colonial possession
1 foot to your left.

372
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:10,779
If your papers are in order,
you can settle down there.

373
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:15,187
Your Majesty, it's such a small planet.
Why do you need borders?

374
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,393
Why do we need borders?

375
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:23,329
Yes. Why do you need borders?
You told me to ask questions.

376
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:27,594
But any child understands
why we need borders.

377
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:30,672
- I don't.
- Well, of course you don't understand.

378
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,467
You're a child.

379
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,668
How do you expect
You can understand

380
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:37,313
International things and stuff?

381
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,745
Scissoring the earth
Carving up the land

382
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,215
Is the business of kings and stuff

383
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,446
Continentally, you are mentally
A silly-billy boy of 2

384
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:49,183
How absurd, it's uneard-of
You can never think as grownups do

385
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,954
Why, you
Why, you

386
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:55,326
Oh, you're a child
You're a child

387
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,093
You're a twerp
And that's putting it mild

388
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:00,896
You're a speck
You're a fleck

389
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:03,869
And it's just too tough
Pounding grown-up stuff

390
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:06,771
In the bean of a green little child

391
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,536
- Try.
- What?

392
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,414
Explain it to me. I want to learn.

393
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:12,844
Well...

394
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:17,283
Why do borderlines exist?
Well, first and foremost on the list

395
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:20,980
If all the borders were destroyed
Tomorrow, I'd be unemployed

396
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:25,128
And what would statesmen do for fun
If all at once the world was one?

397
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,763
And one could wander
Where he pleases

398
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:30,195
Flashing smiles instead of visas

399
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,892
Why, it could

400
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,833
It might

401
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,529
It would

402
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,437
Oh, go away and grow
Come again when you're

403
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:42,636
Not a mini-brained punk like this

404
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:47,375
You are really too undeveloped
For philosophical junk like this

405
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,816
Too adult is it? Difficult is it?
To get your teeth into?

406
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:54,583
Too bewildering for the children
And that, of course, means you

407
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:58,284
Means you
Means you

408
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,624
You're a child
You're a child

409
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,894
And the kind that can
Drive grownups wild

410
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,834
You're a wee little pea

411
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,032
Any thought profound
That I might expound

412
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:15,337
Wort fit into a pineaded child

413
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:17,912
Is that clear?
Now, where are your papers?

414
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,244
- I don't have any.
- You can't stay without papers.

415
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,044
Then I'll leave.

416
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:26,655
Just as well. You're dangerous.
Where's your passport?

417
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:30,089
- I don't have a passport.
- Then you can't leave.

418
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,089
Come back here!

419
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,628
Get off this planet!

420
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:40,168
Come back here!
Get off this planet!

421
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:49,808
Four hundred million and 997,000...

422
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:56,317
...plus six, equals 400,997,006!

423
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,546
Good day, sir.

424
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,624
Good day.

425
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,521
Five hundred million and ten!

426
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,622
Five hundred million and ten.

427
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,468
Plus one.
Five hundred million and 32!

428
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,639
Five hundred million, 32 what?

429
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,298
Five hundred million and 32 plus three.
Those things.

430
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,535
Five hundred million and 35.

431
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:24,146
- Stars?
- That's it. Stars.

432
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,043
Five hundred...

433
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:32,779
...million, 44.

434
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,358
- Plus...
- Why are you counting the stars?

435
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:37,823
Five hundred million...

436
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,623
I own them, and I want to see
how much I have.

437
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:44,130
But what good does it do you
to own the stars?

438
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:48,294
- It does me the good of making me rich.
- What good is it to be rich?

439
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,173
Because...

440
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:51,869
I don't know.

441
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:54,101
But how can you own the stars?

442
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:59,044
When you find a diamond that doesn't
belong to anyone, it's yours.

443
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,749
If you get an idea before anyone else,
it's yours.

444
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:07,448
So I got the idea of owning the stars.

445
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,087
You want to stay here? Fine.
You can help me count.

446
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:16,266
But if I owned a flower,
I could do something for it.

447
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:18,162
What can you do for the stars?

448
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,462
You wouldn't understand.

449
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,236
You're a child.

450
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,670
Gimme, how can you
Gimme, understand

451
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:28,174
Gimme, gimme,
Financial stuff?

452
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:30,404
Gimme, your supply
Gimme, my demand

453
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:33,709
Mentally is gigantial stuff

454
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,909
Gimme oodles of
Gimme boodles of

455
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,985
I don't care what
But give me more

456
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:41,920
You're too poor and immature to know
What there are gimme-gimmes for

457
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:45,289
Why, you're
Why, you're

458
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,599
You're a child

459
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,096
You're a child

460
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:54,067
You're too darling and dopey and mild

461
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,830
You're a nit

462
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,974
Half a wit

463
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:01,572
Speaking wisdom-wise
Private enterprise

464
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:05,715
Is too big
For a twig of a child

465
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,981
Oh, stocks and bonds!
I've lost me place!

466
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,289
Now I shall have to start
all over again.

467
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,791
Here, add up these figures.

468
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:47,290
Good afternoon, sir.
I'm searching for knowledge.

469
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:50,253
Oh, good.

470
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,619
You've come to the right place.

471
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:57,665
It's been said that I am
the greatest historian in history.

472
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:00,735
That's wonderful, sir.
Who said it?

473
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:03,263
I said it. I wrote it.

474
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:07,672
I read it. It's printed.
Consequently, it's fact.

475
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:09,675
It's history.

476
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:12,215
And now that you're here,

477
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:15,146
I shall put you down.
In history, I mean.

478
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:19,150
- Where did you come from?
- From another planet, sir.

479
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,053
- What was it called?
- I don't know, sir.

480
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,989
Oh, good, I'll give it a name.

481
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,495
I like making things up.
That's my job, making things up.

482
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,394
I'm an historian.

483
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:33,161
Let me see. Planet...

484
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,168
Alice! Do you like that?

485
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:40,470
Oh, no, sir. The planet Alice?
I don't like it at all.

486
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,440
No wonder you left it.

487
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:47,106
Here. Read my latest, an official
version of the French Revolution.

488
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,984
The other ones are now
totally inoperative.

489
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,623
Is that the truth, sir?

490
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:57,389
- What?
- The truth.

491
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:58,857
How do you spell it?

492
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:02,191
Never mind, sir.
I don't think I'd better stay.

493
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,092
Right. Wipe!

494
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,757
Left. Left. Left.

495
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:30,859
Shoulders back. Left. Left. Left.

496
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:35,054
Left. Left. On your feet, boy.
On your feet.

497
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,562
Where's your arm, boy? Where?

498
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:42,000
- My arm?
- The colors. The colors.

499
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,798
The flag.

500
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:46,939
Sir, I don't see anyone.

501
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:50,079
How could you?
There's no one there, silly ass.

502
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:54,274
Get those shoulders back. Back. Back!

503
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,510
Not that much. Watch it.

504
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,711
Stand easy.

505
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,957
Welcome to the base.
State your business.

506
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,526
I'm trying to learn about life, sir.

507
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,458
- Learn about what?
- Life.

508
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:11,800
Life? Oh, life. That.

509
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:13,492
Yes, of course.

510
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:17,105
Company, double-quick march!

511
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:19,809
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.

512
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,269
You want to know what life is about?

513
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,210
Dying! That's what it's all about.

514
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:29,318
Die like a hero, boy.
That's the way to live. Company, halt!

515
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,985
Boy, this is your lucky day.

516
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,191
We just happen to have an opening.

517
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:41,330
There's not a blankety-blank soldier
in the whole army. Just a general, me.

518
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:45,226
I can outthink the enemy
but just can't fight them.

519
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:47,529
Enemy? What enemy?

520
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,729
There isn't any, dunce!

521
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:54,138
You've got to have your army first.
Then you find your enemy.

522
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:59,377
Company, on your stomachs! Crawl!

523
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,811
Join up, lad.

524
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:05,114
The army needs you, your country
needs you, and most of all, I need you.

525
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:07,187
Every young man
wants to be a soldier.

526
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,325
Speak up, boy. Any questions?

527
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,526
Which way is the next planet?

528
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,595
The next planet?

529
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:19,860
Oh, the next planet. It is called...
You know, it's that round thing.

530
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:21,870
It's called...

531
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,200
Dirt. No.

532
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,842
Mud.

533
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,079
No. Earth!

534
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,875
That's it, Earth. Bring up the cannon!

535
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:36,512
- Company, on your...
- Which way is it?

536
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,915
- Which way is what?
- Earth.

537
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:41,557
Earth? Oh, Earth.

538
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:44,287
That way. Crawl, men!

539
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:47,894
Shoulders back! Shoulders down!
What about it, boy...?

540
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:35,674
Come back!

541
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:39,913
Who said that?

542
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,581
Who are you?

543
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,924
Be my friend.

544
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:49,889
I'm alone.

545
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:57,730
"What a queer planet," I thought.
Everyone says the same thing.

546
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:00,131
Just about.

547
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:05,067
That was just one year ago,
and all I've learned since I left her

548
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:07,766
is that I should never have left her.

549
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,572
All of those little games of hers,

550
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:14,979
I didn't see all of the affection
that was underneath.

551
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:22,391
One should never listen to flowers,
should one?

552
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:25,423
I wouldn't know.

553
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:28,196
My experience is limited.

554
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:41,938
Oh, I have met a Daisy

555
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:44,478
But where we met is hazy

556
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,276
And I have walked the streets
With Marguerites

557
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:51,682
And clinging vines beside me

558
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:55,154
Oh, I've met a lot of those

559
00:44:56,694 --> 00:45:00,391
But I never met a Rose

560
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:04,563
There's often been a Heather

561
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:06,998
An armful altogether

562
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,798
And I have even met
A Violet

563
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:13,966
Who almost satisfied me

564
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:18,342
Yes, I've met every kind that grows

565
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,879
But I never met a Rose

566
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:27,085
Among the Dahlias

567
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,452
I often dally

568
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:34,461
I left a Lily in the valley

569
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:36,792
But now and then, I ponder

570
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,230
And wonder as I wander

571
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:41,370
Among the fields and shrub

572
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:46,566
Perhaps the trouble is...
Who knows?

573
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:50,838
That I never met a Rose

574
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:55,084
Never, never met a Rose

575
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,494
Perhaps you werert
really looking for one.

576
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,600
Perhaps.

577
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,973
While roaming through the clover

578
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:24,841
Could I have passed her over?

579
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:29,417
When all is said and done
Am I the one to blame?

580
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,817
Who knows?

581
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:37,817
That I never met a Rose

582
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:44,928
Never, never met a Rose

583
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:58,346
Good morning.

584
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:04,686
Good morning.

585
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:09,349
Are you feeling all right?

586
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,861
Why don't you rest for a little while.

587
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:18,590
I can't. We've run out of water.

588
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:22,637
Unless I can get this thing
off the ground...

589
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,302
But I will.

590
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:27,838
Don't worry, I will.

591
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:30,343
- I'm not worried.
- Good.

592
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:33,212
We'll get some water from the well.

593
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:36,879
Well? What well?

594
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:40,614
- Out there.
- What?

595
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:44,351
- Did you see an oasis?
- No, but there must be one out there.

596
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:54,670
No.

597
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:59,809
We could get lost and never find water
and never make it back to the plane.

598
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:04,910
No, I'd rather bet on the motor.
At least we know it can work.

599
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:14,053
- Where are you going?
- To the well.

600
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:17,354
I said we were staying here.

601
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,478
This way.

602
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,780
Why not this way?

603
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:43,543
Or that way or that way?

604
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,688
This way.

605
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,217
Coming?

606
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,916
This is suicide,
don't you understand? Suicide.

607
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,578
Then maybe I won't have
to find my friend The Snake.

608
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,191
- What are you saying?
- It doesn't matter.

609
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:26,089
It does matter. What snake?

610
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:29,090
I'll tell you about him later.

611
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:35,671
- Tell me now.
- You can't draw while you're walking.

612
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:11,332
The stars are beautiful
because of a flower I can't see.

613
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:15,671
Why is the desert
So lovely to see?

614
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:19,713
Why is the desert
So lovely to see?

615
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:24,478
There is a reason
Lovely to tell

616
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:29,887
Because the desert
Is hiding a well

617
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:38,965
What makes the desert
So lovely at night?

618
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:43,333
What makes the desert
So lovely at night?

619
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,838
Millions of reasons

620
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,409
Tell me just one

621
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:53,606
At night, the desert
Is hiding the sun

622
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:04,920
Look! Look!

623
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:14,467
It's water.

624
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:37,322
Why am I happy?
We're dying of thirst

625
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:40,562
Why am I happy?
We're dying of thirst

626
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:43,857
- Why are you happy?
- Why do you think?

627
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,592
Because there's plenty
Of water to drink

628
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:29,497
Why was the desert
So lovely before?

629
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:34,109
Why was it lovely
But not anymore?

630
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:36,506
Water was hiding

631
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,648
No one could see

632
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:42,511
But now the water

633
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:48,817
Is hiding in me

634
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:18,187
- You mustrt forget your promise.
- What promise?

635
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:20,583
You know, a muzzle for my sheep.

636
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:22,280
I won't forget.

637
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:25,188
But first, I want to hear more
about that snake.

638
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:27,625
- Now?
- Now.

639
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:29,992
Very well, then.

640
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:35,365
I met him in a tree at the edge
of the desert, not far from here.

641
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,597
There are some hills here.

642
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:42,604
He was the first real person I met
when I landed here.

643
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:44,905
And until I met someone else,

644
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:48,016
I thought everyone on Earth
was a snake.

645
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:54,118
I arrived on the other side of the tree.

646
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:57,793
Good afternoon.

647
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:04,127
Good afternoon.

648
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:07,401
You're talking to the wrong end.

649
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:17,903
You're a funny animal.
You're nothing but a tail.

650
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:19,342
Where's the rest?

651
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:21,983
- I'm not an animal.
- What are you?

652
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:23,482
What am I?

653
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:26,019
I'm a snake.

654
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:31,654
- I'm enchanted.
- Well, you should be.

655
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,654
You're all cold and slimy.

656
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:38,026
Thank you. It runs in the family.

657
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:41,063
Could you tell me what I've landed on?

658
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:47,506
Yes. This sunny section of the
solar system is called the Sahara.

659
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,179
The name of this planet is Sahara?

660
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:54,544
No, no, no, no. This simmering spot
of singing sand is called the Sahara.

661
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:58,847
The whole silly, stupid, smelly sphere
is called the Earth.

662
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:02,991
Oh, good. I thought I'd come
to the wrong place.

663
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,820
Oh, you have.

664
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:07,829
Listen.

665
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:10,755
You look like a nice fellow.

666
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:15,529
Why don't you take off your sword
and stay a while.

667
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:19,834
You seem like a smart, sensible sort.

668
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:23,410
Why did you swing down
to this sorry, sleazy swamp?

669
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:28,346
- I'm trying to learn something.
- I see.

670
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:33,488
Well, sir, this speck in space
is a scholastic sewer.

671
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:37,626
All that you can learn here
is sorrow. Sorrow.

672
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:40,159
If I were you, I'd scram.

673
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:43,992
I can't, my flock of birds
have flown away.

674
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,363
- So?
- They brought me here.

675
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:49,638
I see.

676
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:54,471
Listen, you are so lucky
that you met me.

677
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:56,235
Why am I lucky?

678
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:58,573
Well, you see, if someday,

679
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:03,647
any day, you want to see your own
small, sparkling star again,

680
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:06,549
I may have a solution.

681
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:10,920
You see, I have this special... sting.

682
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:12,890
It's almost painless,

683
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:17,556
and it can send you scooting
out of this sad slum

684
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:23,501
and sailing into the sweet, sunny,
splendiferous sky.

685
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:25,802
Really?

686
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:34,144
If you would like to cure the fever
Called life

687
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:38,911
Get some relief from all the struggle
And strife

688
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:42,353
The grandest medicine
That I can propose

689
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,527
Is under your nose

690
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:47,719
A snake in the grass

691
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:52,194
If you would like a spot
Where life never goes

692
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:55,701
Where you can leave your body
Home in your clothes

693
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,601
The finest travel agent
You'll ever meet

694
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,709
Is right at your feet

695
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:03,970
A snake in the grass

696
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:08,482
One sting

697
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:13,418
And you can say goodbye
To all of your friends

698
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,590
One sting

699
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:20,456
And you'll be singing
As your spirit ascends

700
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,631
All's well that ends

701
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:27,468
So any day or night
Wherever you are

702
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:31,572
If you would like to take
A trip to a star

703
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:34,971
The quickest transportation
Yet known to Man

704
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,941
Is none other than

705
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:39,205
A snake in the grass

706
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,218
A snake in the grass

707
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:47,582
A snake in the grass

708
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,083
If you would like to leave
That inuman race

709
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:24,289
And take up residence
Out yonder, in space

710
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:28,054
When you are ready
To go traveling on

711
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:30,198
Sit right down upon

712
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,300
A snake in the grass

713
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:36,737
One sting

714
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:41,274
Is quite enough to make you
Happy and free

715
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:44,839
One sting

716
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:49,041
And you'll discover
How relaxed you can be

717
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,152
Posthumously

718
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:55,490
And while you're wandering through
The heavenly blue

719
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:59,526
If you should see the Lord come
Strolling in view

720
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:04,894
Go up and say you bring him
Best wishes from his fallen old chum

721
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,092
A snake in the grass

722
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:11,131
A snake in the grass

723
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:15,733
A snake in the grass

724
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:53,507
One sting.

725
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,677
It's almost painless.

726
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:10,616
A snake in the grass

727
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:13,751
A snake in the grass

728
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:19,232
A snake in the grass

729
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:24,370
I'll be waiting.

730
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:29,042
Wait a minute.

731
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,008
Just a moment.

732
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:34,945
Are you looking for that snake
in order to do away with yourself?

733
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:37,881
I can't get back to my planet
any other way.

734
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:41,250
It's too far,
and my birds have disappeared.

735
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:43,982
Well, of all the...
You...

736
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:48,357
Now, you listen to me. That snake's
poisoned you against the Earth.

737
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:52,898
- It's not what The Snake said.
- He's hated us since the world began.

738
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:56,230
- It's what The Fox said.
- I'll tell you right now,

739
01:02:56,439 --> 01:03:00,500
you're not going to allow yourself
to be poisoned. Is that clear?

740
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:05,870
- What fox?
- The fox I met after I met The Snake.

741
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:07,777
I see.

742
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:11,613
You certainly got yourself mixed up
with a strange crowd.

743
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,615
All right, let's have it.

744
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:16,986
- Where did you meet The Fox?
- In a garden of roses.

745
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:20,253
How many roses in the garden,
50, 1 00, 500?

746
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:24,297
I don't know how many roses,
but if it's too difficult to draw...

747
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,831
No. No. Not at all.

748
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:30,997
Let's get every detail of this whole
sordid nonsense out in the open.

749
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:58,765
When she finds out there are millions
of flowers that look just like her,

750
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:01,232
it will break her heart.

751
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:04,699
Good morning.

752
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,047
I thought I was rich.

753
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:17,550
I thought I had the most unique flower
in all the world.

754
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:21,519
But all I had was a common rose.

755
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:26,718
A common rose and three volcanoes
that came up to my knees.

756
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:30,092
And one of them was extinct at that.

757
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:34,326
That doesn't make me
a very great prince, does it?

758
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:37,602
Good morning.

759
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,707
Good morning.

760
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:47,610
You're a prince?

761
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:50,647
Yes.

762
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:03,796
I'm a fox.

763
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:06,933
I'm sad. Would you play with me?

764
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:15,032
- No.
- Why not? It'll be fun.

765
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:23,249
Where are the others?

766
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:27,885
- What others?
- The other hunters.

767
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:30,687
There's no one here but me.

768
01:05:30,893 --> 01:05:34,420
Please play with me.
I won't harm you.

769
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:38,498
- Then why do you have a gun?
- I don't have a gun.

770
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:42,634
- You must. You're a human being.
- I'm from another planet.

771
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:46,139
- Arert there guns on your planet?
- No.

772
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:50,672
Really?

773
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,145
- Are there hunters on your planet?
- No.

774
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,888
- Any chickens?
- No.

775
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:04,492
- Oh, well, nothing's perfect.
- Let's play hide-and-seek.

776
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:06,559
I can't play with you.

777
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:10,524
- I'm not tamed.
- What do you mean, "tamed"?

778
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:16,033
Can't you stay put? I'm getting dizzy.

779
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:20,336
Sorry. I just don't wish
to become extinct.

780
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:23,307
Do you mean, if I move,
you will disappear again?

781
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:25,207
- Of course.
- Why?

782
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:28,850
You're a human. I'm a fox.
I hunt chickens, you hunt foxes.

783
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:32,316
- But I don't.
- You're a human, and you also lie.

784
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:34,182
But I don't lie.

785
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:36,520
Then you're inuman.

786
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:39,021
To be tamed...

787
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:43,164
Let me know before you move.

788
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:47,867
See if this clears it up. Underneath
the prince, you're a little boy.

789
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:50,436
Just like a million other little boys.

790
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:52,004
I'm a fox.

791
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:56,838
Just like a million other foxes.
But if you tame me...

792
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:02,348
...I won't be like all the other foxes,
and you won't be like the little boys.

793
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:05,019
I'll be unique to you,
and you to me.

794
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:07,719
- You understand?
- Sort of.

795
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:11,754
- Where are you?
- You moved.

796
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:15,021
I'm sorry, it won't happen again.

797
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:21,603
I have a very monotonous life.

798
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:24,298
I hunt chickens.

799
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:29,604
Men hunt me. They come, I hide.
They leave, I come out.

800
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:31,411
That's all.

801
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:35,209
But if you tamed me,
everything would be different.

802
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:38,353
- Even the wheat fields.
- The wheat fields?

803
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:39,883
Of course.

804
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:44,856
I don't like bread, so I don't care about
wheat. Wheat is the color of gold.

805
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,262
Like your hair. So if you tamed me,
I'd start to care about wheat

806
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:49,698
Like your hair. So if you tamed me,
I'd start to care about wheat

807
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:53,096
because it would
remind me of you.

808
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,563
I'm going to sit down.

809
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:01,800
What would I have to do?

810
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:08,246
Well, every day, you would come
and sit where you're sitting now.

811
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:14,149
You'd always come at the same time.
At, let's say, 4 in the afternoon.

812
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:19,521
I could start to get excited
about... Oh, about 3:00.

813
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:22,923
If you came at any old time,
I couldn't get keyed up.

814
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:25,566
But what would I do at 4:00?

815
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,899
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

816
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:32,473
Of course not. If you did, I'd get
frightened and I wouldn't come out.

817
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:34,370
It's like this.

818
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:39,945
At first, I'll hide behind the trees.

819
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:44,482
Trembling...

820
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:46,780
...as I do in winter.

821
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:49,287
In time

822
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:52,859
I'll start to feel at ease

823
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,564
Show my face

824
01:08:56,765 --> 01:08:58,323
And we'll

825
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:02,262
- Beginter
- "Beginter"?

826
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:04,968
Get closer.

827
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:08,037
And closer.

828
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:10,909
And closer.

829
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:15,817
We'll go a glance at a time

830
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:18,646
A small advance at a time

831
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:22,116
We'll be afraid a bit
And shy a bit

832
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:25,225
Avoid each other's eye a bit

833
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:29,930
Less often each day
The ice will soften each day

834
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:35,263
As we get closer
And closer and closer

835
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:42,673
We'll go a blush at a time
A happy flush at a time

836
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:45,676
Begin to laugh a bit
And stare a bit

837
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:51,046
And walk around on air a bit
As gaily we grow

838
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:53,483
As night and daily we grow

839
01:09:53,722 --> 01:09:57,954
A little closer
And closer and closer

840
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,355
And then one day

841
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:02,497
There'll come a day

842
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:06,691
A Christmas Eve
Midsummer Day

843
01:10:06,902 --> 01:10:10,929
A moment when
Right there and then

844
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,472
We're gonna touch

845
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:20,081
Then we'll jump miles at a time
A million smiles at a time

846
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:22,842
Begin to love a lot
And live a lot

847
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:25,384
And give and give and give a lot

848
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:29,251
Away we will go
And every day we will grow

849
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:32,256
A little closer and closer

850
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:36,158
And closer and closer
And closer and closer

851
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:40,165
And closer and closer
All the time

852
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:59,512
And then one day

853
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:02,387
There will come a day

854
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:05,752
A Christmas Eve

855
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:08,953
Midsummer Day

856
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:12,099
A moment when

857
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:15,464
Right there and then

858
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:18,663
We're gonna touch

859
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:21,536
Begin to laugh a bit and stare a bit
And walk around on air a bit

860
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:25,104
As gaily we grow
As night and daily we grow

861
01:12:25,307 --> 01:12:29,266
A little closer and closer
And closer

862
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:57,303
Away we will go
And every day we will grow

863
01:12:57,773 --> 01:13:00,037
- A little closer
- And closer

864
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:02,039
- And closer
- And closer

865
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:03,871
And closer and closer

866
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:07,173
And closer and closer
All the time

867
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:21,885
After I tamed him,
we stayed together for quite a while.

868
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:26,329
But then one day,
I had to say goodbye.

869
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:29,165
I think I'm going to cry.

870
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:34,866
I didn't want to make you unappy,
but you asked me to tame you.

871
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:38,735
- I know.
- Then I haven't done you much good.

872
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:43,316
- It's all been a waste of time.
- No.

873
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:47,520
Because you wasted
so much time on me...

874
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:50,218
...you made me feel very important.

875
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:54,795
But now I feel
sort of responsible for you.

876
01:13:56,999 --> 01:14:00,025
I should have warned you
that would happen.

877
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:03,763
You always feel responsible
for what you've tamed.

878
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:08,807
The moment he said that,
I understood everything.

879
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:12,909
He wasrt like all the other foxes
in the world anymore.

880
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:17,347
I tamed him, and now
he was unique, at least to me.

881
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:21,011
And my flower
wasrt like all those other flowers,

882
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:26,126
because I had fetched her a screen
and put a glass bowl over her at night

883
01:14:26,328 --> 01:14:30,697
and listened when she grumbled,
and now she was my rose.

884
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:36,201
And I was responsible for her, and
I had to go back and take care of her.

885
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:45,810
I brought you a present.

886
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:48,508
It's a secret.

887
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:51,544
So I wrote it down.

888
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:05,295
The last time I saw him,
he was sitting in a wheat field.

889
01:15:08,904 --> 01:15:10,963
What was the secret?

890
01:15:21,316 --> 01:15:25,047
It's only with the heart
that one can see clearly.

891
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:30,755
What's essential...

892
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:34,755
...is invisible to the eye.

893
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:53,948
It works!

894
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:56,208
Eureka! It works!

895
01:15:58,453 --> 01:16:00,478
I need air!

896
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,787
It works.

897
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:09,086
It works!

898
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:48,426
Wait.

899
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:50,229
Don't.

900
01:17:09,024 --> 01:17:11,424
My God. What have you done?

901
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:16,225
No.

902
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:19,833
Don't.

903
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:27,334
I'm glad you've repaired your engine.
Now you can go back home.

904
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:33,113
- Yes.
- I, too, am going back home.

905
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:37,917
You must keep your promise.

906
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:43,086
- What promise?
- You know, a muzzle for my sheep.

907
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:46,852
I'm responsible for this flower.

908
01:17:48,196 --> 01:17:51,359
Please. You promised.

909
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:06,178
You also forgot the fence.

910
01:18:17,826 --> 01:18:21,193
It's a very nice muzzle and fence.

911
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:23,159
Thank you.

912
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:29,595
You're cold as ice.

913
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:32,764
Are you afraid?

914
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:39,039
Please leave me.

915
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:45,915
I can't.

916
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:48,851
I won't.

917
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:13,546
I don't want you to suffer.

918
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:18,118
I'll look as if I'm dead,
but it won't be true.

919
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:24,315
It's just that it's too far
to carry this body with me.

920
01:19:24,526 --> 01:19:27,256
You understand, don't you?

921
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:32,161
This part of me will be like
an old, abandoned shell.

922
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:36,599
There's nothing sad
about old shells, is there?

923
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:03,863
My star is so small
I can't show you where it is.

924
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:09,799
I'm going back there now, but before
I do, I want to give you something.

925
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:13,334
All I want is to hear you laugh again.

926
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:17,535
You will hear me laugh.
More than you ever did before,

927
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:20,306
because on one of those stars,

928
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:23,507
I'll be laughing,
but you won't know which one.

929
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:26,619
So they'll all be laughing,
all the stars.

930
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:31,616
It will be like a bell that's hanging
from every star in the sky.

931
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:36,096
There now, that's all.

932
01:20:51,046 --> 01:20:52,707
Little Prince

933
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:55,815
From who knows where

934
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:58,008
Was it a star?

935
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,450
Was it a prayer?

936
01:21:00,655 --> 01:21:05,115
With every smile
You clear the air

937
01:21:05,327 --> 01:21:08,819
So I can see

938
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:14,598
Oh, Little Prince
Don't take your smile

939
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:17,704
Away from me

940
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:25,506
When you came
My day was done

941
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:30,117
And then your laugh
Turned on the sun

942
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:32,115
Oh, Little Prince

943
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:37,758
Now, to my wonder and surprise

944
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:42,396
All the hopes and dreams
I lived among

945
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:47,830
When this heart of mine
Was wise and young

946
01:21:48,036 --> 01:21:51,528
Shine for me again

947
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:53,731
Little Prince

948
01:21:54,309 --> 01:21:57,210
In your eyes

949
01:22:49,431 --> 01:22:51,422
Please, Little Prince

950
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:55,592
Don't take your smile away from me

951
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:03,533
When you came
My day was done

952
01:23:03,745 --> 01:23:07,545
And then your laugh
Turned on the sun

953
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:09,307
Oh, Little Prince

954
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:14,580
Now, to my wonder and surprise

955
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:19,283
All the hopes and dreams
I lived among

956
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:24,454
When this heart of mine
Was wise and young

957
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:29,262
Shine for me again

958
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:31,598
Little Prince

959
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:38,071
In your eyes

960
01:24:23,858 --> 01:24:25,382
Where are you?

961
01:24:25,927 --> 01:24:28,794
I won't leave without you!

962
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:32,860
Oh, my God.

963
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:37,526
It never happened.

964
01:25:40,502 --> 01:25:42,595
He wasrt here.

965
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:47,005
It never happened.
