1049
01:13:29,184 --> 01:13:32,119
Oh, weII,
did you expect to see him around?

1050
01:13:32,287 --> 01:13:36,815
WeII, yes, I did,
but I guess I was wrong about him.

1051
01:13:37,459 --> 01:13:41,122
You know, I can't figure him out.

1052
01:13:41,296 --> 01:13:43,924
He hasn't seen Lucy James
since we started rehearsing.

1053
01:13:44,099 --> 01:13:45,794
JENNY: He hasn't?
-Not once.

1054
01:13:45,967 --> 01:13:47,662
Then, why haven't you heard
from him?

1055
01:13:47,836 --> 01:13:49,701
Maybe because he thinks I'm married.

1056
01:13:49,871 --> 01:13:52,567
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

1057
01:13:52,741 --> 01:13:56,006
Gee, I'm the one
that spoiIed everything for you.

1058
01:13:56,177 --> 01:13:59,806
-Oh, you weren't to bIame, Jenny.
-Oh, yes, I was too.

1059
01:13:59,981 --> 01:14:03,644
And if I'd known then what I know now,
it never wouId have happened.

1060
01:14:04,052 --> 01:14:06,612
You know, Nora,
I've been thinking things over.

1061
01:14:06,788 --> 01:14:10,656
And when Gunny gets out of the Navy,
we're gonna settIe down, make a go of it.

1062
01:14:10,825 --> 01:14:13,089
You are? Oh, I'm so gIad.

1063
01:14:13,261 --> 01:14:16,196
-What did Gunny say when you toId him?
-I haven't toId him yet.

1064
01:14:16,364 --> 01:14:18,195
WeII, how did you decide?

1065
01:14:18,366 --> 01:14:21,392
WeII, I kissed him
and I didn't think I Iiked it, but--

1066
01:14:21,569 --> 01:14:22,866
But you did.

1067
01:14:23,038 --> 01:14:25,529
Yeah. I did.

1068
01:14:29,377 --> 01:14:32,744
BeIieve me, without pubIicity
you can wrap the show up.

1069
01:14:33,448 --> 01:14:35,643
RehearsaIs are fine.
What are you kicking about?

1070
01:14:35,817 --> 01:14:38,684
I'd rather pIay safe and keep the pubIic
Lucy James conscious.

1071
01:14:38,853 --> 01:14:41,151
But pIease, Mac,
not about my private Iife.

1072
01:14:41,322 --> 01:14:42,653
Nothing spreads Iike gossip.

1073
01:14:42,824 --> 01:14:45,657
It's the best kind of baIIyhoo
as Iong as you keep it cIean.

1074
01:14:45,827 --> 01:14:48,887
WeII, I didn't mind at first,
but now it's different.

1075
01:14:50,131 --> 01:14:52,861
Are you on the IeveI?
Are you serious this time?

1076
01:14:54,436 --> 01:14:57,166
Yeah, just as you were a few months ago
with Tommy Morgan.

1077
01:14:57,338 --> 01:14:59,829
HonestIy, Mac, I swear this is different.

1078
01:15:00,008 --> 01:15:03,205
-Yeah, I've heard that before too.
-Oh, forget it.

01:15:04,979 --> 01:15:07,277
-This Barker is out of the Navy, isn't he?
-Yes.

1080
01:15:07,449 --> 01:15:09,781
If he's crazy about you,
why hasn't he been around?

1081
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:13,284
-Because he resents the whoIe thing.
-Oh, he does. WeII, that's too bad.

1082
01:15:13,455 --> 01:15:17,289
He phoned and wanted to see me.
That is, if it couId be arranged privateIy.

1083
01:15:17,459 --> 01:15:18,926
And I asked him to come here.

1084
01:15:19,094 --> 01:15:20,925
-Tonight?
-Any minute now.

You're writing the finish first.
The man hasn't asked me yet.

1087
01:15:26,968 --> 01:15:30,460
But if he does and I shouId marry him,
not a word in the papers about it.

1088
01:15:30,638 --> 01:15:32,799
What's the use
if you don't get any pubIicity?

1089
01:15:32,974 --> 01:15:34,407
Oh, Mac, you're hopeIess.

1090
01:15:34,576 --> 01:15:36,510
AII right, go ahead and marry him.

1091
01:15:36,678 --> 01:15:38,976
Let's arrange for a divorce
before the show opens.

1092
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:41,905
-We need the pubIicity.
-There'II be no pubIicity.

Look, I hope I'm not interrupting.

-ShaII we go out on the terrace, Ted?

-SkoaI.

Uh, why was Mr. McKay
here tonight?

1111
01:16:30,832 --> 01:16:34,097
I sent for him to put a stop
to that cheap pubIicity we were getting.

1112
01:16:34,269 --> 01:16:36,760
Oh, weII, thanks.

1113
01:16:37,038 --> 01:16:39,700
That's the reason I came up here
to taIk to you tonight.

1114
01:16:39,874 --> 01:16:42,240
I toId him if there was
one more word about us...

WeII, are you serious?

WeII, what'II happen to the show
opening night?

can pIay your part?

Oh, I wouIdn't know about that.
