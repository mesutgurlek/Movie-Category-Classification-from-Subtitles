1
00:02:12,494 --> 00:02:14,462
Sir, our consignment has left from
Geneva on the twentieth

2
00:02:15,497 --> 00:02:17,465
Okay. Make arrangements for its
clearance. -Okay.

3
00:02:23,505 --> 00:02:25,473
Sir, our seafood export contract in
Germany has been extended for

4
00:02:26,508 --> 00:02:28,476
another year.
Good.

5
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:33,470
Sir, Mr. Morrison from New York has
called and agreed to open a factory

6
00:02:34,516 --> 00:02:37,485
in our collaboration.
-That's very good.

7
00:02:41,523 --> 00:02:45,482
Sir, Kailasnath and his company has
quoted a real low rate in their tender..

8
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:51,488
Kishanlalji, we will quote an even
lower rate.... -But sir,...

9
00:02:52,534 --> 00:02:55,503
...remember, we should not lose this
contract come what may, okay..

10
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:04,444
Yes, Kishanlalji... speak your mind

11
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:07,449
lts not my place to say this, but sir,
we may suffer a loss if we quote an

12
00:03:08,484 --> 00:03:10,452
even lower rate than Kailasnath and
his company..

13
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:15,457
How much will we lose? One crore,
two crores, four crores.....it does not

14
00:03:16,492 --> 00:03:18,460
make a difference.

15
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:26,457
But, this will hurt Kailasnath forever
and l can't bear to Kailasnath live

16
00:03:27,503 --> 00:03:30,472
a good and happy life.

17
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:35,477
Dayashankar! Dayashankar!

18
00:03:36,512 --> 00:03:40,471
He always tips over and upsets my
win at the last minute by his games

19
00:03:42,518 --> 00:03:46,477
l always end up a loser. Never mind,
my name is Kailasnath...

20
00:03:48,524 --> 00:03:50,492
We know that since our childhood

21
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:54,496
Shut up! My own son is making fun
of me! Even l will have my day. And

22
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:57,499
that day l will destroy him forever.

23
00:03:58,534 --> 00:04:00,502
But when will that day come father?

24
00:04:02,538 --> 00:04:05,439
lt will come. Every dog has its day.

25
00:04:07,476 --> 00:04:09,444
You hurt his feelings

26
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:15,450
My friend Rajpal, l still remember
that day twenty years ago.....

27
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:25,460
Greetings brother....

28
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:32,467
You! Why have you come here now?

29
00:04:35,504 --> 00:04:40,464
How can you not know why l'm here?
lt's the same thing every time.

30
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:45,469
Twenty lakhs rupees. For now, l will
make do with that much.

31
00:04:46,515 --> 00:04:48,483
Kailasnath, you have taken more
than your inheritance. Now you will

32
00:04:49,518 --> 00:04:51,486
not get anything.

33
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:59,483
lts not that easy to get rid of me.
Besides, we are related by blood

34
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,430
l don't believe in such blood relations

35
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:08,436
You are a result of my father's
mistake and l have to suffer for it

36
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:12,440
Yes, you are right. That old man died
before he could pay for his mistake.

37
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:16,444
As it is, that's the way things usually
are... one makes a mistake while

38
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,448
somebody else pays for it. Anyway,
you are his sole son in the eyes of

39
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:24,452
the world, while l am his illegitimate
son....his bastard.

40
00:05:26,488 --> 00:05:32,449
Yes, bastard! You have proved that
someone like you can never improve

41
00:05:35,497 --> 00:05:40,457
l am going to be around you all the
time, bugging you.

42
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,471
GET OuT!

43
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,419
Here you go. Rajpal, if you don't mind..
can l ask you a question? -Yes

44
00:06:12,468 --> 00:06:15,437
You look very worried nowadays

45
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:21,443
Yes, l have been very worried.
What happened?

46
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,439
My father made a mistake once.
Every time his son Kailasnath comes

47
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:33,444
here, l get real anxious.

48
00:06:35,491 --> 00:06:39,450
He is a bad man and he can do
anything anytime.

49
00:06:42,498 --> 00:06:48,459
Don't worry, my friend. l am with you.
Nothing will happen to you.

50
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:03,417
Hands up, uncle. -Hold on, let
me eat an apple before l die.

51
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:11,426
Hold on. Okay, shoot me.

52
00:07:13,462 --> 00:07:16,431
Hands up, dad.
Okay, now its my turn.

53
00:07:19,468 --> 00:07:22,437
Hands up. Please, don't shoot me.
Please.

54
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:26,441
Amar, shoot your father.

55
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:46,461
Bhaisahib!
-Rajpal!

56
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,468
Rajpal, what happened?

57
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:05,412
Rajpal! Rajpal!

58
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:08,416
l don't have a lot of time, my friend

59
00:08:09,451 --> 00:08:11,419
Nothing will happen to you.

60
00:08:14,456 --> 00:08:19,416
Promise me that you will take care of
Amar after me.... Rajpal!

61
00:08:22,464 --> 00:08:25,433
No, my friend. RAjPAL!

62
00:08:54,496 --> 00:09:00,457
Don't cry, my child. Once gone, the
dead people don't come back.

63
00:09:02,504 --> 00:09:05,405
Besides, l am with you.

64
00:09:08,443 --> 00:09:14,404
Dayashankar, l will keep an eye on
how long you keep this child under

65
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,418
your wing.

66
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:25,415
Kailasnath, l will never let either you
or your cruel plans even touch Amar.

67
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:30,420
l will fight against you and your cruel
intentions.

68
00:09:51,486 --> 00:09:53,454
My child!

69
00:10:07,502 --> 00:10:10,471
This girl is like an whirlwind. l have
told her several times to keep her

70
00:10:11,506 --> 00:10:14,475
room clean, but she does not listen
at all.

71
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,478
Why are you grumbling so much, my
dear?

72
00:10:18,513 --> 00:10:21,482
What else should l do? Not a single
thing is in place. l give up on Pooja.

73
00:10:23,518 --> 00:10:26,487
ls this the same Pooja that made us
both suffer- you inside and me out

74
00:10:27,522 --> 00:10:29,490
when she was born?

75
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:32,493
Even today l am suffering.

76
00:10:33,528 --> 00:10:38,488
My darling wife, do you remember
when Pooja was very sick once? We

77
00:10:39,534 --> 00:10:44,494
had prayed so much and were so
worried. Do you remember?

78
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,509
How can l forget? My dear little child

79
00:10:49,544 --> 00:10:52,513
My poor little baby!
She was in so much pain.

80
00:10:53,548 --> 00:10:55,516
My poor little baby!

81
00:10:56,551 --> 00:11:00,510
You have spoilt her with your babying
Tomorrow when your baby marries

82
00:11:01,556 --> 00:11:04,457
and goes to her in-laws, what will
they say?

83
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:07,462
They will say that she is
Dayashankar's daughter.

84
00:11:08,497 --> 00:11:14,458
You will never change. You keep on
making money and she, spending it.

85
00:11:15,504 --> 00:11:17,472
She must be blowing away money
somewhere for sure.

86
00:11:18,507 --> 00:11:20,475
This much shopping is enough for
today, right? -Bye.

87
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,478
We will meet in jogger's park
tomorrow, don't forget.

88
00:12:16,498 --> 00:12:18,466
Oooh, sorry!

89
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:25,473
Oh my God, run!

90
00:12:26,508 --> 00:12:28,476
Hey! Where are you running off to?
Wait!

91
00:12:30,512 --> 00:12:32,480
l won't let you off like that.

92
00:12:34,516 --> 00:12:36,484
She has blackened my face.

93
00:12:49,531 --> 00:12:52,500
Hey STOP! STOP!

94
00:13:01,543 --> 00:13:03,443
Madam!

95
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,449
License! lts one way.

96
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:25,466
What happened?

97
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:30,471
Puncture! Shoot!

98
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:35,476
Here you go. Can l go now? Thank
you, thank you.

99
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:45,486
Where did she go?

100
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:51,492
She's become Mr. lndia.

101
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:55,496
Tire puncture!

102
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:04,437
Can you help me go home, my son?
Yes. Give me your luggage.

103
00:14:10,478 --> 00:14:13,447
Wait here please.

104
00:14:14,482 --> 00:14:17,451
Auto! Stop here. Come on.

105
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:23,457
No, no. That's the driver's seat. Sit in
the back, here.

106
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:29,452
My bag. God bless you.

107
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:37,460
Brother, where did that girl go?
Which girl?

108
00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:41,475
The one who took my cane from me.
Auto, stop.

109
00:14:45,513 --> 00:14:47,481
And then l broke both his eyes

110
00:14:48,516 --> 00:14:50,484
Whose? His?
-No, his car's.

111
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,487
You mean headlights?
Yes, my tubelight.

112
00:14:54,522 --> 00:14:59,482
Then he got real mad and turned
towards me and l socked him like this

113
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:06,434
Then?
Then l acted like l was blind

114
00:15:07,469 --> 00:15:09,437
How?
like this.

115
00:15:10,472 --> 00:15:12,440
A shopping bag in this hand and a
cane (stolen) in this hand...

116
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:20,437
Then l walked.... Son, take me to a
rickshaw, my son....

117
00:15:24,486 --> 00:15:26,454
...and he....he....

118
00:15:30,492 --> 00:15:35,452
Do you want a cab, eh? Who is going
to pay for my damages?

119
00:15:36,498 --> 00:15:39,467
l will. But l don't have anything now.
l will pay you later.

120
00:15:40,502 --> 00:15:43,471
No. l want repayment now.
l told you l will pay later.

121
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:52,469
No. l want it right now.
l will pay later.

122
00:15:56,518 --> 00:15:58,486
Now we are even.

123
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:28,438
Pooja, lets go.
Yes.

124
00:16:39,494 --> 00:16:42,463
Hello doll.
Hello.

125
00:16:53,508 --> 00:16:56,477
Naina, lets go up.
Okay.

126
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:05,418
Oh, that's so cute.

127
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:18,432
Are you okay?
Yes.

128
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:56,470
lts so much fun. Are you frightened?
-No. lt's a lot of fun.

129
00:17:58,506 --> 00:18:01,475
What a lovely feeling.
-Really!

130
00:18:12,453 --> 00:18:14,421
Pooja!
Who is it?

131
00:18:15,456 --> 00:18:17,424
lts your worshipper.

132
00:18:21,462 --> 00:18:25,421
From which temple?
Not temple, l worship you.

133
00:18:26,467 --> 00:18:30,426
Pooja, its me Vijay. So far l have
always succeeded in my endeavors.

134
00:18:32,473 --> 00:18:35,442
But l will really succeed when l will
win over your affection.

135
00:18:36,477 --> 00:18:38,445
l have seen a lot of people like you.

136
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,448
But you must not have seen someone
like me.

137
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:45,452
You are very insolent. Come, face me
you want to see me?

138
00:18:56,497 --> 00:18:59,466
Hey, you worshipper...
Yes?

139
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:03,402
Who do you think you are? You must
be crazy. You have been stalking me

140
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:07,408
for a long time. ln a store, on the
phone. Now you have landed a plane

141
00:19:08,443 --> 00:19:12,402
in the middle of the highway. This is
not your airfield. My car has been in

142
00:19:14,449 --> 00:19:17,418
an accident and l have suffered a lot
of damages. l will report you to police

143
00:19:19,454 --> 00:19:22,423
You blackened my face....
l will send you to jail.

144
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:28,418
No problem. Whatever had to happen
happened. What do we do now?

145
00:19:29,464 --> 00:19:31,432
At least say bye to them.

146
00:25:31,626 --> 00:25:33,594
Vikasmohan?
What number do you want?

147
00:25:34,495 --> 00:25:37,464
6336507?
-lt's a wrong number

148
00:25:38,499 --> 00:25:40,467
l lost my money for no reason.

149
00:25:45,506 --> 00:25:47,474
Can you please give the phone to the
girl? -What?

150
00:25:48,509 --> 00:25:50,477
Yes, the one who is walking outside.
girl?

151
00:25:51,512 --> 00:25:53,480
The blue one.
is there ever a blue girl?

152
00:25:54,515 --> 00:25:56,483
Oh! Blue jeans, okay.

00:26:31,485 --> 00:26:37,446
Really? l don't buy it.
Okay, Then try and test me.

159

165
00:27:39,487 --> 00:27:45,448
One, two, three........ten, eleven. l'll
hit him with all these shoes.

166
00:27:46,494 --> 00:27:52,455
He promised me that he will sit and
eat fish curry and dessert with me.

167
00:27:53,501 --> 00:27:59,462
Why does he also manage to fool me
so? l am hungry and he is still gone.

168
00:28:03,444 --> 00:28:09,405
Mama Lucy...
Hi, sonny. Are you back?

169
00:28:11,452 --> 00:28:13,420
You must be hungry.
Yeah.

170
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:22,418
Here you go. Take this and this and
this.

171
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:40,447
Where did this girl come from?

172
00:28:41,482 --> 00:28:46,442
Who are you? And where is that
damn Vijay?

173
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,455
Mama, l am here.

174
00:28:53,494 --> 00:28:56,463
Are you not ashamed of hiding
behind a female? Who is she?

175
00:28:57,498 --> 00:29:01,457
She is Pooja, she is Mama.....
What Are you saying?

176
00:29:02,503 --> 00:29:07,406
She is Pooja, she is Mama. She has
taken care of me throughout my life,

177
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:12,401
looked after me. l am her mother lndia
and she is my son of lndia.

178
00:29:13,447 --> 00:29:16,416
l am her son of lndia and she is my
mother lndia.

179
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:21,410
You are cheating me with long tales.

180
00:29:22,456 --> 00:29:24,424
Mama, she is the same one...

181
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,419
..she is so beautiful when she's shy...
She really looks like an angel.

182
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:36,425
This idiot has done something worth
while for the first time. l told him often

183
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:41,430
to bring home a bride, but he never
listened. What happened?

184
00:29:43,477 --> 00:29:47,436
God bless you, my child. Why are
you staring at me? Pooja has come

185
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:50,450
here for the first time, give her
something sweet to eat.

186
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:53,453
Come here.
What Are you doing?

187
00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:58,458
Giving you something sweet. Why
won't anybody let me do it?

188
00:30:00,494 --> 00:30:04,453
Auntie, let me take your leave now.
do visit here sometimes.

189
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:07,467
Think of this as your own house.
Shut up.

190
00:30:09,503 --> 00:30:12,472
When l had gone to your uncle's
house for the first time, he had given

191
00:30:13,507 --> 00:30:17,466
me this. Now you keep it.
-Auntie, me....l...

192
00:30:18,512 --> 00:30:22,471
Keep it, l will like you to have it.
its free, keep it.

193
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:29,478
Okay, l will leave now.
-Mama, l'll drop her....give you sweet

194
00:30:32,526 --> 00:30:36,485
God, please make Pooja my
daughter-in-law soon.

195
00:30:38,532 --> 00:30:42,491
Sir,sir...
Laxmi, why Are you shouting?

196
00:30:43,037 --> 00:30:46,495
Sir, the young master is coming.
What?

197
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:49,509
Amar's coming?
But how do you know?

198
00:30:50,044 --> 00:30:53,502
He was trying to phone you but it
was engaged, so he called me.

199
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:57,517
Oh... Parvati, Listen...
l am coming.

200
00:30:58,052 --> 00:31:00,520
Amar is coming.

201
00:31:01,055 --> 00:31:02,955
Amar is coming...
-Amar is coming....

202
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,958
Pooja, come down soon....Amar is
coming.

203
00:31:07,494 --> 00:31:09,962
Fantastic! Let him come. l will
welcome him in such a way that he

204
00:31:10,497 --> 00:31:12,465
will remember it all his life.

205
00:36:22,476 --> 00:36:24,444
Pooja should be coming.

206
00:36:30,484 --> 00:36:33,453
Sir... Welcome... Congratulations...

207
00:36:34,488 --> 00:36:38,447
Sir, You have grown so big...
Yes, But you Are still the same.

208
00:36:39,493 --> 00:36:42,462
l had taken an oath that l will remain
same till you come back

209
00:36:42,996 --> 00:36:45,464
so that you can recognize me.

210
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:50,470
ls everything alright?
Yes, everything is okay.

211
00:36:54,508 --> 00:36:56,476
Pooja, what are you doing?

212
00:37:00,514 --> 00:37:02,482
l am washing out his foreign influence

213
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,418
Now it's started.

214
00:37:07,454 --> 00:37:11,413
What's going on Pooja. You haven't
left your childishness. Release him.

215
00:37:18,465 --> 00:37:21,434
Poor boy got all wet. Released.....

216
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,597
They have grown up but they still act
and play like children.

217
00:37:25,973 --> 00:37:27,440
Yes, you are right.

218
00:37:35,482 --> 00:37:37,950
Okay, my foreign color got washed
out

219
00:37:38,986 --> 00:37:40,954
Now what will happen to you?

220
00:37:42,489 --> 00:37:44,457
No... No...

221
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,469
Give me a hand.
-Come on...

222
00:38:08,448 --> 00:38:10,416
She ditched me...

223
00:38:12,452 --> 00:38:14,420
There is no time value.

224
00:38:27,968 --> 00:38:29,435
Are you upset?
-No... you have come only one hour

225
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,438
late. You could have come one more
hour late.

226
00:38:33,473 --> 00:38:36,442
Okay, now tell me how do l look?
Amar brought it for me.

227
00:38:36,977 --> 00:38:38,444
So...

228
00:38:38,979 --> 00:38:41,447
Look at this chain. Amar got this one
too.

229
00:38:41,982 --> 00:38:43,449
So...

230
00:38:43,984 --> 00:38:46,452
Amar has brought me so many good
things like this bag, ear rings,

231
00:38:46,987 --> 00:38:51,447
sunglasses, these shoes, this dress.
Everything. Amar brought it for me.

232
00:38:52,492 --> 00:38:56,451
Then go to your Amar. What are you
doing here?

233
00:38:58,498 --> 00:39:00,466
Vijay, What happened to you?

234
00:39:01,501 --> 00:39:03,401
Okay, even l don't want to talk to you

235
00:39:04,438 --> 00:39:07,407
ls she really going?
Pooja!

236
00:45:48,508 --> 00:45:51,477
Tomorrow reach there on time and
don't praise Amar.

237
00:45:52,512 --> 00:45:54,480
Okay, l won't. l love you.
-l love you.

238
00:45:55,515 --> 00:45:58,484
Amar, have you chosen a girl for
marriage?

239
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:01,487
For who, you? Are you tired of auntie?

240
00:46:02,522 --> 00:46:04,422
l am talking about you, not me.

241
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:07,426
l have selected her.

242
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:10,429
How is she?
Very beautiful.

243
00:46:11,464 --> 00:46:13,432
Color?
Very fair.

244
00:46:14,467 --> 00:46:16,435
Where is she from?
Local.

245
00:46:23,476 --> 00:46:26,445
Then l will have to take my proposal
back.

246
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,449
May l ask you to name the girl of
your choice, uncle?

247
00:46:32,485 --> 00:46:34,453
l can choose only one person and
her name is Pooja. -WHAT?

248
00:46:39,492 --> 00:46:43,451
My son, if this is the case now, then
what will happen after marriage?

249
00:46:46,499 --> 00:46:51,459
Parvati! Parvati!
l am here.

250
00:46:53,506 --> 00:46:55,974
l am very happy today
why, What happened?

251
00:46:56,509 --> 00:46:58,477
Amar has agreed.
really?

252
00:46:59,012 --> 00:47:01,480
Yes. Now we will get them married in
a grand style.

253
00:47:02,515 --> 00:47:07,418
l was waiting for this day. Now watch
how l dress my sweet little daughter

254
00:47:08,454 --> 00:47:13,414
And my beautiful bride will start her
married life

255
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:19,420
Parvati, this house will become really
empty after Pooja moves away.

256
00:47:22,468 --> 00:47:25,437
When you had married me and
brought me here, hadn't my parent's

257
00:47:25,972 --> 00:47:27,439
house become empty?

258
00:47:28,474 --> 00:47:30,442
a parent's happiness lies in the fact
that their daughter goes to her in-

259
00:47:30,977 --> 00:47:32,444
laws house with dignity.

260
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,448
Good morning, dad.
Good morning, mom.

261
00:47:38,484 --> 00:47:40,952
What traditions were you talking
about?

262
00:47:41,487 --> 00:47:44,945
We were talking about you.
Then it must be definitely special.

263
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:48,460
You are absolutely right.
-Then tell me, don't wait.

264
00:47:49,495 --> 00:47:51,963
Parvati, you tell her.
No. you tell her.

265
00:47:52,498 --> 00:47:54,466
You want me to?

266
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:59,460
We have decided to get Amar and
you betrothed.

267
00:48:01,507 --> 00:48:04,408
And even Amar has agreed to this
proposal. -Yes.

268
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:14,409
You decided between yourselves.
Didn't even try to find out my feelings

269
00:48:16,456 --> 00:48:20,916
We don't need to know what you feel.
We know that you can never get a

270
00:48:21,461 --> 00:48:24,430
better proposal than Amar in this
world.

271
00:48:25,465 --> 00:48:28,434
How can you say that, dad? You
don't even know him.

272
00:48:28,968 --> 00:48:32,426
At least meet him once.
Who, Vijay?

273
00:48:33,473 --> 00:48:38,433
A simple pilot? You don't know a
thing about his family or his parents.

274
00:48:38,978 --> 00:48:42,436
What can he give you?

275
00:48:42,982 --> 00:48:45,951
All that that can make your daughter
happy for the rest of her life.

276
00:48:46,486 --> 00:48:48,954
You are not in the right frame of mind

277
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:53,459
l fulfilled all your wishes. l dreamt big
dreams for you. And now you are

278
00:48:53,993 --> 00:48:56,461
destroying all my dreams.

279
00:48:58,498 --> 00:49:01,467
l will not let this happen. You will get
married to Amar only.

280
00:49:02,001 --> 00:49:04,902
You will marry Amar only.

281
00:49:18,451 --> 00:49:21,420
Hi Pooja, l...
Statue.

282
00:49:22,455 --> 00:49:25,424
How dare you? Why did you say yes
to our marriage? l have loved you as

283
00:49:26,459 --> 00:49:29,428
a good friend. What kind of a friend
are you?

284
00:49:35,468 --> 00:49:37,436
l love someone else.

285
00:49:39,472 --> 00:49:43,431
But you have messed everything up.
Don't stand still, say something.

286
00:49:44,477 --> 00:49:46,445
Released.

287
00:49:55,488 --> 00:49:59,447
That's it. uncle asked me and l said
yes. You have to respect elders.

288
00:49:59,992 --> 00:50:03,450
There is nothing to get upset over. lf
you say so, l will say no to him.

289
00:50:04,497 --> 00:50:06,465
Really?
Yes.

290
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:12,460
But at least tell me who is the lucky
guy that you love.

291
00:50:13,506 --> 00:50:16,475
You want to meet him?
Of course.

292
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:20,479
Be ready tomorrow evening. l will
come and pick you up. Okay?

293
00:50:21,514 --> 00:50:23,482
Thank you.
Thanks.

294
00:51:29,515 --> 00:51:32,484
Statue!
Released.

295
00:51:36,522 --> 00:51:39,491
You fell.
Statue!

296
00:52:29,508 --> 00:52:34,639
You said so easily that you love
someone else. But you have forgotten

297
00:52:35,014 --> 00:52:39,974
that friend from your childhood who
only wished for you. Pooja, how can

298
00:52:40,519 --> 00:52:45,479
l live this life without you?

299
00:52:58,537 --> 00:53:00,505
Come on...

300
00:53:04,477 --> 00:53:07,446
Hello, where are you going? You act
like you know him already.

301
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,949
l don't know him but watch me, l will
recognize him in a glance.

302
00:53:11,484 --> 00:53:14,510
Why just one shot, take a couple
more... three guesses, l mean

303
00:53:15,488 --> 00:53:18,457
Okay, lets give it a try.
Yes.

304
00:53:43,516 --> 00:53:47,475
Vijayji, greetings.
Greetings, my friend.

305
00:53:49,522 --> 00:53:53,481
How do you know me? l am Vijay
Bannerjee.

306
00:53:54,026 --> 00:53:57,484
l am looking for Vijay Mukherjee.
Sorry.

307
00:54:05,471 --> 00:54:07,439
Come on.
-No no no.....

308
00:54:09,475 --> 00:54:11,443
Hi Vijay.
What did you say?

309
00:54:11,978 --> 00:54:14,446
Nothing, big brother.
Oh my God.

310
00:54:36,502 --> 00:54:41,462
Pooja, you have to admit at my
guesswork that l recognized Amar.

311
00:54:42,508 --> 00:54:46,467
Yes sir. l salute to your third glance.
Come, have a seat.

312
00:54:51,517 --> 00:54:53,485
Pooja always talks about you.

313
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,488
Good or bad?
Obviously Good.

314
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:59,491
And you are much better than what
l had heard about you.

315
00:55:07,466 --> 00:55:11,425
One vanilla milkshake for me.
Chocolate milkshake for me and him

316
00:55:15,474 --> 00:55:19,433
She knows what l want.
and l know What he wants.

317
00:55:22,481 --> 00:55:26,440
Someone should ask me what l want.

318
00:55:28,487 --> 00:55:31,456
Big brother...
-Yes...

319
00:55:33,492 --> 00:55:39,453
we have our brother over here
and with a beautiful girl

320
00:55:40,499 --> 00:55:43,468
But who is the third person with this
girl?

321
00:55:44,503 --> 00:55:47,472
Must be someone.

322
00:55:52,511 --> 00:55:57,471
Even l am aching for her. lf l get her,
even l will celebrate Diwali.

323
00:55:58,517 --> 00:56:04,422
We will. ln any case, we have a right
on our brother's property.

324
00:56:23,476 --> 00:56:26,445
Where did you park your car?
its over there.

325
00:56:26,979 --> 00:56:30,437
The driver parked it. Did you forget?
Yes, l forgot.

326
00:56:34,487 --> 00:56:38,446
Oh oh! l forgot my lighter. You go on
ahead, l will be right back.

327
00:56:54,507 --> 00:56:57,476
One of you was wishing that someone
should ask you what you want. So

328
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:00,478
here we go. What do you want, my
friends?

329
00:57:01,013 --> 00:57:04,414
What have you come to give?
-Hold this. Here's your cold milkshake

330
00:57:10,456 --> 00:57:13,425
Save him, save him, bring some water

331
00:57:39,485 --> 00:57:42,545
Vijay is always like this. He is
always forgetting something or other

332
00:57:42,988 --> 00:57:47,550
Pooja, l really liked your choice.
Really? l am very happy

333
00:57:50,496 --> 00:57:53,465
But why is Vijay not here yet?
-He will. He's looking for his lighter.

334
00:57:53,999 --> 00:57:56,467
ls he looking for it or making it?
Sorry, Sorry.

335
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:00,472
lt was under the table. l found it after
looking real hard.

336
00:58:02,508 --> 00:58:07,502
Oh God! l forgot my glasses. l will be
back in two minutes.

337
00:58:07,947 --> 00:58:11,405
Looks like it's a day for forgetting
things today. -l guess.

338
00:58:15,454 --> 00:58:20,414
What's up? You were anxious to
celebrate Diwali? As a brother, l have

339
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,418
brought these flowers to share.
Then Give them.

340
00:58:43,482 --> 00:58:45,450
He will come, don't worry.

341
00:58:47,486 --> 00:58:50,455
l forgot my glasses at home.
Crazy.

342
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:55,450
What? When you are in, he's out.
And vice versa. Sometimes you

343
00:58:55,995 --> 00:59:00,455
forget your lighter, and he his glasses
Either you both stay in or stay out.

344
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,404
Vijay, look at him. Amar, both have
disappeared.

345
00:59:25,457 --> 00:59:28,426
Looks like there is something wrong
inside.

346
01:00:29,521 --> 01:00:33,480
What have you done here?
-l haven't done a thing.

347
01:00:34,026 --> 01:00:34,993
What are you doing here?

348
01:00:35,527 --> 01:00:38,496
l was looking for both of you. Where
were you two?

349
01:00:39,031 --> 01:00:41,499
lt doesn't matter now that you found
us. God know what you do.

350
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:54,501
You are Kailasnath's lions. And Amar
turned you into cotton in no time.

351
01:00:55,547 --> 01:00:58,516
He was not alone. There was another
guy with him.

352
01:00:59,051 --> 01:01:01,019
Where did this other person come
from?

353
01:01:01,553 --> 01:01:04,454
Don't know, dad. But he was even
better than Amar.

354
01:01:05,491 --> 01:01:09,450
l am trying to eliminate my enemies
and they keep on growing in numbers

355
01:01:09,995 --> 01:01:12,463
Who is this new enemy?

356
01:01:19,505 --> 01:01:22,474
How do l look?
this blue hat will go with it. Fantastic

357
01:01:23,509 --> 01:01:26,478
l think this will go with it.

358
01:01:29,515 --> 01:01:32,484
Amar, this white hat does not go.
The color does not match.

359
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:37,489
What are you talking? See this.

360
01:01:38,023 --> 01:01:39,991
Amar, this is Rs. 2000, this is Rs.500
This is better.

361
01:01:40,526 --> 01:01:43,495
Look at this border...
Excuse me. l like this one.

362
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:46,498
Lets fight some more...

363
01:01:48,534 --> 01:01:52,493
We came out with bags instead of
a hat...

364
01:01:53,539 --> 01:01:57,498
Why are you laughing?

365
01:02:07,486 --> 01:02:10,455
Sister, don't cut from there, cut from
here. Like this. That's exactly how l

366
01:02:10,989 --> 01:02:13,457
want them. She should look like
Miss World.

367
01:02:14,493 --> 01:02:17,462
He's absolutely right, but you should
cut the hair at the back of her head

368
01:02:17,996 --> 01:02:21,454
like this.
Amar, Are you crazy, talking stupid

369
01:02:22,501 --> 01:02:25,470
things. This is how the hair.....
-Cut this hair like this.....

370
01:02:26,004 --> 01:02:30,464
Shut up! Quiet!
you may Cut her hair your way.

371
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,488
l was waiting for you only.

372
01:02:45,524 --> 01:02:47,492
How are you?
Okay.

373
01:02:48,527 --> 01:02:50,495
Come. Lets play a game or two.

374
01:03:07,479 --> 01:03:10,448
uncle, today l have come to ask you
for something.

375
01:03:10,983 --> 01:03:15,443
What is it that you needed to ask me
for? All that is mine is yours.

376
01:03:19,491 --> 01:03:23,450
l have a priceless treasure with me,
even that will be yours one day.

377
01:03:24,496 --> 01:03:29,456
l am waiting for the day when Pooja
will go to your house as your bride.

378
01:03:30,502 --> 01:03:34,461
That will be the happiest day of my
life.

379
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:44,471
uncle, even l want happiness. Not
for me, but for Pooja.

380
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:51,489
That's what we are giving her, my son

381
01:03:53,525 --> 01:03:57,484
No, uncle. Pooja's happiness lies
with someone else, not me. And l

382
01:03:58,030 --> 01:04:02,490
don't want to grab that from Pooja.

383
01:04:03,468 --> 01:04:05,436
Amar...

384
01:04:08,473 --> 01:04:13,433
Yes uncle. Pooja loves Vijay, not me
-She is very naive. lt's a mistake that

385
01:04:13,979 --> 01:04:18,439
she is making. Vijay does not love
her. He is just using her as a ladder

386
01:04:19,484 --> 01:04:25,445
to get to my wealth. l know it well.

387
01:04:32,497 --> 01:04:38,458
No, uncle. Vijay is not that kind of
guy. l have met him.

388
01:04:39,004 --> 01:04:40,471
You met him?

389
01:04:42,507 --> 01:04:48,468
l've met him, l've judged him. And he
is really a right man for Pooja. And

390
01:04:49,014 --> 01:04:53,474
as far as his financial situation goes,
we can get rid of that problem.

391
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,489
This cannot be possible, not at all...
-Please!

392
01:05:04,463 --> 01:05:10,424
Listen to me. l always want to see
Pooja smiling, not with tears in her

393
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:17,431
eyes. Only Vijay can give her all the
laughter in the world, not me.

394
01:05:19,478 --> 01:05:21,446
But, son....
uncle, Please.

395
01:05:22,481 --> 01:05:27,441
You have called me a son, then listen
to your son.

396
01:05:31,490 --> 01:05:37,451
Okay. My happiness is in your
happiness.

397
01:05:39,498 --> 01:05:43,457
Vijay sahib, do come in. You...
Where is your sir?

398
01:05:44,002 --> 01:05:45,469
He is not home yet.

399
01:05:46,004 --> 01:05:48,472
He calls me over and disappears
himself.

400
01:05:49,007 --> 01:05:51,475
lf he called you, then he will come
definitely.

401
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:53,978
Please have a seat, l will bring you a
nice hot cup of tea.

402
01:05:54,513 --> 01:05:56,481
No, l will drink it with your sir.
As you wish.

403
01:05:57,516 --> 01:06:01,475
Tell me, your sir lives all alone in this
big house.

404
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:04,921
No, l also live with him.

405
01:06:05,457 --> 01:06:11,418
Married or not?
Even l wish That l should have a

406
01:06:11,963 --> 01:06:17,424
beautiful wife, who will cook hot food
for me, sing a lullaby for me....

407
01:06:20,472 --> 01:06:26,433
l am not talking about your marriage,
l am talking about your sir.

408
01:06:26,978 --> 01:06:29,981
He used to love a lot, he was also
supposed to get married..

409
01:06:29,981 --> 01:06:32,449
To whom?
Laxmi, Who Are you talking about?

410
01:06:32,984 --> 01:06:35,452
l was talking about me. You have a
seat, l will bring tea.

411
01:06:35,987 --> 01:06:38,455
Hi.
Hi Vijay. Sorry, l was a little late.

412
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:42,448
The traffic is as slow as the speed in
the pace of life.

413
01:06:42,994 --> 01:06:46,452
A lot of times you have to change
roads to get home. Lets go in the bar

414
01:07:03,949 --> 01:07:07,407
Amar, do you think of me as a friend?
Any doubt?

415
01:07:08,453 --> 01:07:11,911
Yes, l doubt a lot. lf you thought of
me like that, then you would not hide

416
01:07:12,524 --> 01:07:15,516
anything from me.

417
01:07:15,961 --> 01:07:18,429
Hide what?
just That you were in love with some

418
01:07:18,964 --> 01:07:23,424
one, were supposed to get married...
What happened? Did she cheat you?

419
01:07:31,476 --> 01:07:34,445
No, not her. The circumstances
cheated us.

420
01:07:38,483 --> 01:07:41,452
Who was she? Won't you tell me her
name?

421
01:07:43,488 --> 01:07:48,448
No, my friend. Now that she belongs
to someone else, l can't reveal it.

422
01:07:51,496 --> 01:07:56,456
Anyway, forget this. l had almost
forgotten why l called you.

423
01:07:57,502 --> 01:08:01,461
Here you go.
What is this?

424
01:08:02,007 --> 01:08:04,407
Read it and sign it. From today you
are the director of Rajpal Aviation's.

425
01:08:04,943 --> 01:08:10,404
And also a chief engineer as well.
What?

426
01:08:13,451 --> 01:08:17,410
Amar, such a big obligation....
now you Are forgetting, Vijay. you

427
01:08:17,956 --> 01:08:20,424
call me a friend on one side and talk
about gratitude on the other.

428
01:08:20,959 --> 01:08:25,419
But Amar..... -There is no
gratitude among friends. Congrats.

429
01:08:49,487 --> 01:08:53,446
My god. You look beautiful. l can't
believe that l am handing you over to

430
01:08:53,992 --> 01:08:58,452
someone else. Maybe l will have to
change my plans.

431
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,400
l was just joking.

432
01:09:11,443 --> 01:09:14,412
Auntie, what are you doing here?
Why don't you come inside?

433
01:09:14,946 --> 01:09:17,414
No, l am okay here.

434
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:37,425
Today, l am announcing Pooja's
engagement with Vijay Khanna.

435
01:09:39,471 --> 01:09:44,431
On this occasion l ask for you to
bless this couple.

436
01:17:16,461 --> 01:17:18,429
What's the matter? You look very
upset.

437
01:17:18,963 --> 01:17:22,421
Yes, l wanted to send some important
documents to Cochin and pilots have

438
01:17:22,967 --> 01:17:26,425
striked today. lt will be a loss of
thousands.

439
01:17:31,476 --> 01:17:34,445
l will carry them for you, if you don't
mind.

440
01:17:34,979 --> 01:17:39,439
l had almost forgotten that you are a
pilot. Are you free?

441
01:17:40,485 --> 01:17:45,445
Don't worry. lts only a half hour flight.
l will be back in an hour.

442
01:17:46,491 --> 01:17:51,451
Here is the file.
When do l have to take it?

443
01:17:55,500 --> 01:18:01,530
Right now.
Which one, the blue one?

444
01:18:47,485 --> 01:18:49,510
Yes, your work is done.

445
01:19:11,442 --> 01:19:14,411
l am losing altitude.
Bring the plane in control.

446
01:20:18,261 --> 01:20:21,230
Doctor, l don't understand what is the
matter?

447
01:20:24,267 --> 01:20:28,226
As your family doctor, l should not
hide anything from you.

448
01:20:28,771 --> 01:20:33,231
Your daughter is pregnant.

449
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:53,251
Pooja, my child, you made such a big
mistake in your youth. This will only

450
01:20:53,796 --> 01:20:59,257
lead to destruction for you and us.

451
01:21:00,303 --> 01:21:06,264
Parvati, our daughter is very under-
standing. She will not do anything

452
01:21:06,809 --> 01:21:12,270
that will damage us and make me
ashamed to even face myself in the

453
01:21:14,317 --> 01:21:19,220
mirror. Pooja, you will have to abort
this baby.

454
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:28,720
Dad, no. Life has stolen my love from
me. Now please don't tell me to lose

455
01:21:29,265 --> 01:21:33,224
his last memory also. Please dad.

456
01:21:36,272 --> 01:21:42,233
You stupid girl. The baby that you call
the memory of your love is going to be

457
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:49,240
called a bastard by this world. And
Dayashankar will not allow this.

458
01:28:35,224 --> 01:28:40,184
(Recites poetry)

459
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:53,208
This formula also backfired.

460
01:28:55,244 --> 01:28:59,203
Come on Pooja, lets go for a drive.
-l don't want to go.

461
01:28:59,749 --> 01:29:02,217
Why not?
Leave me alone.

462
01:29:04,253 --> 01:29:10,214
Leave you alone? No way. l am your
friend.

463
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:23,160
l can feel your pain. l also know that
one can tolerate their own pain. But

464
01:29:23,706 --> 01:29:29,167
if it affects others, then it is easier to
share it with others.

465
01:29:36,218 --> 01:29:42,179
Amar, some heartaches cannot be
shared with others. My parents want

466
01:29:45,227 --> 01:29:51,188
me to give up Vijay's last gift of love.

467
01:29:53,235 --> 01:29:59,196
Gift of love?
Yes. l am pregnant with his child.

468
01:30:06,248 --> 01:30:11,208
Now you tell me, who will share this
with me?

469
01:30:15,257 --> 01:30:17,225
l will share it with you.

470
01:30:23,265 --> 01:30:29,226
l will give me name to this child. l will
marry you.

471
01:31:03,305 --> 01:31:05,273
She is waiting for you. Bye.

472
01:31:53,289 --> 01:31:58,249
Pooja, we might be husband and wife
in the eyes of the world. But l will not

473
01:31:58,794 --> 01:32:04,255
do anything that will break your heart.

474
01:32:49,278 --> 01:32:54,238
Dayashankar has played such a sixer
by marrying his daughter with my

475
01:32:55,284 --> 01:33:00,244
nephew. The ball is completely out
of the field for us now.

476
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:06,250
Daddy, l can't even see the ball. lf l
saw the ball, then l will run him out.

477
01:33:07,296 --> 01:33:10,265
l mean, kill him.

478
01:33:10,799 --> 01:33:13,768
Then there will not be any hindrance
for us.

479
01:33:14,303 --> 01:33:17,704
You be quiet. Amar will not just die.
he will leave a child in his wake and

480
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:21,209
then the inheritance will go to the
child.

481
01:33:22,244 --> 01:33:25,213
What should we do?

482
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:31,219
Sometimes l feel that you are not my
children. lf l had to kill Dayashankar,

483
01:33:32,254 --> 01:33:35,223
l would have killed him before. He is
very cunning and we will have to think

484
01:33:35,758 --> 01:33:39,216
twice before every step.

485
01:33:52,274 --> 01:33:56,233
Here you go.
No No No.

486
01:33:56,779 --> 01:34:02,240
Look, you have to eat. Remember,
you've someone else eating with you.

487
01:34:11,293 --> 01:34:13,261
See you.
one minute.

488
01:34:43,258 --> 01:34:46,227
Be careful. Slowly.

489
01:34:49,264 --> 01:34:51,732
Sir, you have a phone call.
tell them That l am busy.

490
01:34:52,267 --> 01:34:54,235
Sir, its urgent. lts from your home.

491
01:35:01,276 --> 01:35:04,245
Sir, you have become the child of a
cute little father. l mean you have

492
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:07,248
become the father of a cute little baby.

493
01:35:35,244 --> 01:35:37,712
Hi. How are you?
l am fine.

494
01:35:38,247 --> 01:35:41,216
That's great. Where is the child.
over there.

495
01:35:47,256 --> 01:35:49,224
He looks just like you.

496
01:35:49,758 --> 01:35:54,218
lf my child doesn't look like me, then
who will he look like? Right?

497
01:37:01,263 --> 01:37:03,231
Sshh! Pooja!
l am coming.

498
01:37:03,765 --> 01:37:07,223
What did l know?
did you get your father wet?

499
01:37:18,213 --> 01:37:20,181
Come on the horse. Come on.

500
01:37:26,221 --> 01:37:30,180
Mom, l will become a pilot.
you will Not become a pilot, okay?

501
01:37:30,726 --> 01:37:32,694
Laxmi, put this in my briefcase.

502
01:37:33,228 --> 01:37:36,197
Where is the briefcase?
Downstairs.

503
01:37:36,732 --> 01:37:40,190
Daddy, mom will not let me become
a pilot.

504
01:37:41,236 --> 01:37:45,195
Why not? You can become whatever
you want. lf you want to become a

505
01:37:45,741 --> 01:37:48,710
pilot, then that's what you will be.

506
01:39:14,262 --> 01:39:18,164
uncle, where is Auntie Lucy who used
to stay here?

507
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:24,161
The poor woman passed away. When
her son Vijay was killed in an plane

508
01:39:24,706 --> 01:39:29,166
accident, she couldn't absorb the
shock and died.

509
01:41:24,259 --> 01:41:26,227
Drink your milk.
-Hold on mama....

510
01:41:26,761 --> 01:41:29,229
You can do this later. Drink your milk
first.

511
01:41:30,265 --> 01:41:35,225
You drink half....come on, drink. You
have become so thin.

512
01:42:26,254 --> 01:42:30,213
Now l know why you never answered
my letters. You brought up an orphan

513
01:42:30,759 --> 01:42:39,224
like me with so much love and now
you have left me alone. Very nice.

514
01:43:00,288 --> 01:43:04,247
Do you want to meet anyone?
Pooja used to live here.

515
01:43:05,293 --> 01:43:09,252
My sir's daughter. She got married
and moved away.

516
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:23,200
Even she did not wait for me. Mama
also left me alone.

517
01:43:40,262 --> 01:43:42,230
Who are you?

518
01:43:56,278 --> 01:43:58,303
Your death.

519
01:43:59,281 --> 01:44:01,249
Are you Vijay?

520
01:44:42,257 --> 01:44:44,225
Tell me, who tried to kill me.

521
01:46:05,273 --> 01:46:07,241
Tell me, who tried to kill me. Say it.

522
01:46:56,257 --> 01:47:00,216
This is the same car that was involved
in the Mishra accident.

523
01:47:17,212 --> 01:47:19,180
Don't trouble your teacher, learn
carefully.

524
01:47:22,217 --> 01:47:25,186
Send the car on time for lunch, it
was late yesterday.

525
01:47:35,230 --> 01:47:39,189
Bye Rahul. Remember to bring his
history book today. Bye.

526
01:47:44,239 --> 01:47:48,198
She couldn't wait for even a little
while.

527
01:48:51,239 --> 01:48:54,208
Hello, who is this idiot on the line?

528
01:48:54,742 --> 01:48:58,200
Pooja, l am Amar. Why are you so
upset?

529
01:48:59,247 --> 01:49:01,215
You...oh nothing...

530
01:49:01,749 --> 01:49:05,207
l called to tell you that l have a
meeting tonight. l will be late.

531
01:49:05,753 --> 01:49:08,221
Try to come early.
l will, But lt will be atleast midnight.

532
01:49:08,756 --> 01:49:12,214
Midnight?
Yes, you eat your dinner and sleep.

533
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:17,163
Okay.
Bye.

534
01:49:30,211 --> 01:49:31,678
Midnight!

535
01:51:40,274 --> 01:51:44,233
Toady my love has broken all barriers
and made you mine.

536
01:51:47,281 --> 01:51:50,250
After seeing you after so long, l felt
like l got my life.

537
01:51:50,785 --> 01:51:55,245
You said so easily that you love some
one else. Wish l could tell you how

538
01:51:55,790 --> 01:51:59,248
much l love you. How can l live
without you?

539
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:11,260
That means that l was the barrier. By
breaking that, you stole Pooja from

540
01:52:11,806 --> 01:52:16,209
me. Amar, l realized today, that your
friendship was all fake. You tried to

541
01:52:16,744 --> 01:52:23,206
kill me but l have come as your death
today. l will make your life hell.

542
01:52:35,263 --> 01:52:41,224
Fire! Fire! Laxmi uncle, there is a fire
Hurry up.

543
01:52:44,272 --> 01:52:46,240
Bring water, quick!

544
01:53:04,292 --> 01:53:07,261
What?
the cottage is on fire. Please hurry.

545
01:53:07,795 --> 01:53:10,263
Okay, l will be right there.

546
01:54:02,283 --> 01:54:08,244
You said so easily that you like Vijay.
Wish l could tell you how much l love

547
01:54:08,789 --> 01:54:12,247
you. From childhood till today.

548
01:55:18,225 --> 01:55:20,193
Pooja how can l live without you.

549
01:55:22,229 --> 01:55:26,188
After seeing Pooja after a long time
today, it felt like l got my life. l can

550
01:55:26,734 --> 01:55:31,694
hardly wait for the day when you will
come to my house as my bride.

551
01:55:32,239 --> 01:55:38,200
But when l found out, l think l lost you

552
01:55:44,251 --> 01:55:48,210
You loved me so much without letting
me know. You always tried to look

553
01:55:48,756 --> 01:55:53,216
out for my happiness and l gave you
grief. Your love is great and you are a

554
01:55:53,761 --> 01:55:58,221
great person. l bow to you and your
love.

555
02:03:16,236 --> 02:03:19,205
Amar, what happened?
Nothing.

556
02:03:21,241 --> 02:03:24,210
No my son, it's a lot.

557
02:03:24,745 --> 02:03:27,213
The murderer had your name on this
bullet.

558
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:31,718
Kailasnath! Kailasnath!

559
02:03:38,258 --> 02:03:44,219
Why am l scared, this is my house.
Even a dog acts like a lion in his area

560
02:03:44,765 --> 02:03:50,226
Dayashankar, why are you screaming
like that in a decent man's house?

561
02:03:51,271 --> 02:03:55,230
l am not deaf.

562
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:59,234
You may not be deaf but you are
definitely dumb. You have always

563
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:05,240
acted slyly. You killed Rajpal and
now you tried to kill Amar?

564
02:04:07,287 --> 02:04:13,248
Amar? l cannot do such an evil thing
to my nephew. No, no.

565
02:04:14,294 --> 02:04:18,196
Only you can do such a thing. Do you
remember what l had said at Rajpal's

566
02:04:18,732 --> 02:04:25,194
funeral? Even the shadow of your
misdeeds will not touch our Amar.

567
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:30,199
Your Amar? Since when did he
become your Amar? You should be

568
02:04:30,744 --> 02:04:36,705
grateful to me that you are still alive,
only because we have no enmity.

569
02:04:37,251 --> 02:04:39,219
You were Rajpal's enemy.

570
02:04:40,254 --> 02:04:44,213
l killed my brother, not a stranger. lt
is a family matter. After his death, l

571
02:04:44,758 --> 02:04:49,218
should have received the inheritance.
But due to you, l lost it. You started

572
02:04:49,763 --> 02:04:55,224
running everything only because you
were his friend.

573
02:04:57,271 --> 02:05:03,232
You were his enemy, not his brother.
And l was his friend as well as his

574
02:05:03,777 --> 02:05:10,239
brother. l had promised him that
nobody will steal Amar's inheritance.

575
02:05:11,285 --> 02:05:14,254
Sometimes you have to sacrifice your
life to keep your promise.

576
02:05:14,721 --> 02:05:17,189
Are you threatening me?

577
02:05:17,724 --> 02:05:22,184
No, l am giving you advice. Your best
interests are in you packing your bag

578
02:05:22,729 --> 02:05:25,698
and leaving this place. Let Lord
Shankar help you.

579
02:05:26,233 --> 02:05:32,194
lf you stay here, you will die. Because
in our family, there will be always be

580
02:05:32,739 --> 02:05:35,207
a lot of bloodshed.

581
02:05:37,244 --> 02:05:43,205
Kailasnath, you missed your aim. But
now l have written your name on this

582
02:05:43,750 --> 02:05:49,211
bullet. The next time this bullet leaves
my gun, l will not miss my aim.

583
02:05:56,263 --> 02:05:59,232
Daddy, why was Dayashankar
barking at us?

584
02:05:59,766 --> 02:06:04,226
Now you come, you idiots. l love and
feed you more than my dogs and yet

585
02:06:04,771 --> 02:06:08,229
you can't even bark, if not bite.

586
02:06:09,276 --> 02:06:13,235
Tell me, did you fire at Amar?
No.

587
02:06:13,780 --> 02:06:16,180
Did you?
No.

588
02:06:18,218 --> 02:06:24,179
That's amazing. lf none of us fired at
him, then who was it?

589
02:06:41,241 --> 02:06:46,201
The sky fell down and there was a
disaster. Dayashankar's factory has

590
02:06:46,747 --> 02:06:50,205
been destroyed.

591
02:06:51,251 --> 02:06:55,210
l had not even hissed venomously at
him and this happened. What l could

592
02:06:55,756 --> 02:07:00,216
not do in twenty years, this person
has done it in twenty minutes.

593
02:07:00,761 --> 02:07:04,219
Looks like Dayashankar has got a
new enemy.

594
02:07:04,765 --> 02:07:06,232
New enemy? What do you mean?

595
02:07:06,767 --> 02:07:10,225
You idiot. We are already his enemies
right? But we haven't done this. l feel

596
02:07:10,771 --> 02:07:14,229
like kissing whoever did this job.

597
02:07:15,208 --> 02:07:19,167
Mr. Commissioner, we are incurring
a lot of destruction. And you people

598
02:07:19,713 --> 02:07:25,174
are just trying. l don't want tryouts, l
want you to catch the criminal.

599
02:07:26,219 --> 02:07:32,180
Don't worry at all. Wherever he is, he
will be caught soon.

600
02:07:32,726 --> 02:07:35,695
Hello, who is speaking?
your destruction.

601
02:07:36,229 --> 02:07:39,198
Don't be stupid, who are you?

602
02:07:40,233 --> 02:07:46,194
l fired at you, you didn't know it. Your
factory was burnt down, you didn't

603
02:07:46,740 --> 02:07:52,201
know. Don't be silly, Amar. Very soon
you will find out my identity.

604
02:07:57,250 --> 02:08:01,209
Whose phone was it, son?
the same man Who destroyed us.

605
02:08:10,263 --> 02:08:12,231
Now catch it.

606
02:08:22,209 --> 02:08:27,169
Mommy, look what l found.
What did you find? Let me see.

607
02:08:40,227 --> 02:08:42,195
Lighter. This is Vijay's lighter.

608
02:08:43,230 --> 02:08:47,189
My lighter had gone under the table
hence l had to look for it.

609
02:09:43,223 --> 02:09:47,182
Mama, l have written so many letters
to Pooja and you, but you two never

610
02:09:47,727 --> 02:09:52,187
wrote back. When l was going to
Cochin, my plane caught fire suddenly

611
02:09:52,732 --> 02:09:57,192
l was saved by God's grace. The
fishermen saved my life. l was

612
02:09:57,737 --> 02:10:01,195
unconscious for many years. When l
regained consciousness, l tried to get

613
02:10:01,741 --> 02:10:06,201
in touch with you. But unfortunately,
l was unable to walk and hence l felt

614
02:10:06,746 --> 02:10:10,204
ashamed. Their leader took good care
of me and now l am able to walk. l am

615
02:10:10,750 --> 02:10:16,211
coming. l want to get even with the
person who did this to me. Yours Vijay

616
02:10:22,262 --> 02:10:27,222
NOOOO! You all cheated me. You
all lied to me.

617
02:10:43,283 --> 02:10:46,252
Pooja, what are you doing?

618
02:10:46,786 --> 02:10:49,254
Get out of my sight!

619
02:10:52,292 --> 02:10:54,260
What happened Pooja? Why are you
crying?

620
02:10:54,794 --> 02:10:56,261
Don't touch me!

621
02:10:56,796 --> 02:10:59,264
You have blood on your hands. You
are a murderer!

622
02:10:59,799 --> 02:11:01,767
What? Are you in your senses?

623
02:11:02,302 --> 02:11:06,261
l wasn't before, but now l am. Vijay
did not die, he was killed. By none

624
02:11:06,806 --> 02:11:11,266
other than you. Here, read this.
You sent Vijay away on an excuse so

625
02:11:11,811 --> 02:11:17,215
you could kill him. You sabotaged his
plane and put him out of your way.

626
02:11:17,751 --> 02:11:22,211
Why? Why did you do it?

627
02:11:25,258 --> 02:11:30,218
l had thought of you as my friend. You
showed me sympathy and gave me

628
02:11:30,764 --> 02:11:35,224
so much grief. Why? just to win me?

629
02:11:35,769 --> 02:11:41,230
No. You are misjudging me. lf Vijay
is alive, then it is a happy news for all

630
02:11:41,775 --> 02:11:46,235
lt is good news only for me. You must
be very sad with it.

631
02:11:46,780 --> 02:11:51,240
Where is Vijay, Pooja? l want to
meet him.

632
02:11:51,785 --> 02:11:55,744
Who do you want to meet? The one
who is after your blood?

633
02:11:56,289 --> 02:12:02,250
l am not afraid of death. l am sad
because both of you misjudged me.

634
02:12:07,300 --> 02:12:12,260
You still haven't got rid of your mask.
You played with our lives and yet you

635
02:12:13,306 --> 02:12:18,209
are..... l cannot stay with a selfish
man like you. l feel suffocated. l am

636
02:12:18,745 --> 02:12:23,205
leaving and l will not be coming back
to this house again.

637
02:12:29,255 --> 02:12:31,723
A daughter comes to in-laws house
after marriage and only leaves it when

638
02:12:32,258 --> 02:12:33,225
she dies.

639
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:37,718
You are right, father. Please kill me
so that l don't have to live with a

640
02:12:38,264 --> 02:12:40,232
murderer. Please kill me.

641
02:12:40,767 --> 02:12:43,235
Who are you talking about?

642
02:12:43,770 --> 02:12:47,228
The same man who is standing as
my husband in front of me.

643
02:12:47,774 --> 02:12:51,232
Who has he killed?
my love.

644
02:12:51,778 --> 02:12:55,236
You mean Vijay?
Vijay is alive, daddy.

645
02:12:58,785 --> 02:13:03,245
Vijay can escape death once, not
again and again. -Daddy!

646
02:13:05,792 --> 02:13:08,260
Amar is not Vijay's killer.

647
02:13:08,795 --> 02:13:14,256
Then who is it? Tell me so that l can
kill him. He has destroyed his life.

648
02:13:28,248 --> 02:13:32,207
Then kill me.
Daddy, you?

649
02:13:34,254 --> 02:13:38,213
Yes. l am Vijay's killer.

650
02:13:41,261 --> 02:13:46,221
Why? You knew that Pooja never
loved me. l can't believe that you

651
02:13:46,766 --> 02:13:52,227
played with Vijay's life like that. uncle,
l had told you that l can't bear to see

652
02:13:52,772 --> 02:13:58,233
tears in Pooja's eyes. lnspite of all
that, you killed everybody's happiness

653
02:13:58,778 --> 02:14:05,240
for my sake. Why?

654
02:14:10,290 --> 02:14:16,195
You want to know? Then listen.
Whatever l am today is due to Amar's

655
02:14:16,729 --> 02:14:22,190
father and my friend, Rajpal. l had
promised Rajpal when he died that

656
02:14:22,735 --> 02:14:28,196
Amar's well-being and his happiness
will be my life's aim. You started

657
02:14:28,741 --> 02:14:35,203
loving Vijay and Amar sacrificed his
happiness for yours. But l couldn't let

658
02:14:36,249 --> 02:14:43,212
that happen. Hence, l sacrificed your
happiness by planning to kill Vijay.

659
02:14:54,267 --> 02:15:01,230
And not just that, but l also hid all of
Vijay's letters about his survival from

660
02:15:01,774 --> 02:15:07,235
you. Because Dayashankar would do
anything to maintain the promise

661
02:15:07,780 --> 02:15:10,248
given to his friend.

662
02:15:27,233 --> 02:15:31,192
Pooja!
Let me die, l want to die.

663
02:15:36,242 --> 02:15:42,203
Life has brought me at such an uneven
crossroad today. On one side is my

664
02:15:42,749 --> 02:15:48,210
husband who has helped and
comforted me. On the other side is

665
02:15:48,755 --> 02:15:54,216
love who is screaming for justice.
You tell me what l should do.

666
02:15:59,265 --> 02:16:05,226
l don't know, Pooja. Life is always
testing us and we never know when.

667
02:16:08,274 --> 02:16:14,235
All l know is that l have and will
always be your friend. This is our test

668
02:16:16,216 --> 02:16:22,177
and we will pass it together. We will
get out of this.

669
02:16:33,233 --> 02:16:35,201
You stay here and l will be back with
your teddy.

670
02:16:35,735 --> 02:16:38,203
Come soon.
l will. Give me a kiss.

671
02:17:29,222 --> 02:17:33,181
Mommy! Mommy!

672
02:17:37,230 --> 02:17:39,198
Rahul, my child! Rahul. Save my son!

673
02:18:03,256 --> 02:18:08,216
Take care of him. His father will come
out to save him.

674
02:18:08,761 --> 02:18:11,229
Now will start the fight between the
snake and the mongoose.

675
02:18:11,764 --> 02:18:15,165
Tell Kailasnath that if Amar does
not show up, then kill the child.

676
02:18:17,203 --> 02:18:23,164
l want my son. l can't live without him
Daddy, please find him for me.

677
02:18:23,710 --> 02:18:29,171
Have some faith, nothing will happen
to Rahul. lf Rahul gets hurt....

678
02:18:34,220 --> 02:18:37,189
Yes, l am Amar. Have you found out
anything about Rahul?

679
02:18:37,724 --> 02:18:43,185
You will know about him. First listen
to me. A few years ago, you had

680
02:18:43,730 --> 02:18:49,191
traded my life. You won't live long for
that. Anyway, you will die when you

681
02:18:49,736 --> 02:18:53,194
realize that your son is in my hands.
-Listen to me.....

682
02:18:53,740 --> 02:18:59,201
You listen to me. Your time to talk
has expired and its time l spoke. lf

683
02:18:59,746 --> 02:19:03,204
you wish to save your child, then
come to Madh island before twelve

684
02:19:03,750 --> 02:19:08,210
tomorrow. Or else l will send your
son's pieces parceled to your house.

685
02:19:11,257 --> 02:19:13,282
And yes, you wanted to know who l
am...your old friend Vijay.

686
02:19:34,213 --> 02:19:40,174
What's the matter Pooja? Are you
surprised to see me alive?

687
02:19:41,220 --> 02:19:47,181
You think you are alive. But you can't
be the Vijay that l was so devastated

688
02:19:48,394 --> 02:19:56,199
to lose. You just have his body, not
his soul. His soul is not as evil as you

689
02:20:04,243 --> 02:20:11,206
You are right. l am evil, but why?
Because you have lost your shame.

690
02:20:14,253 --> 02:20:21,216
You called yourself a living dead body
at my death. Do you remember that

691
02:20:26,265 --> 02:20:30,224
a dead person is buried and not
married? ln our society, people grieve

692
02:20:30,770 --> 02:20:35,230
on someone's death. They do not
celebrate for a few days. But you went

693
02:20:35,775 --> 02:20:40,235
and got married. Aren't you not
ashamed of yourself? Did you not

694
02:20:40,780 --> 02:20:47,242
have faith in me? Was that love fake?
You are evil, not me. Your soul has

695
02:20:47,787 --> 02:20:51,245
no morals.

696
02:20:51,791 --> 02:20:54,259
Did you finish what you had to say?
lf there is anything left, say that too.

697
02:20:55,294 --> 02:21:00,254
l want to see how much venom you
have in you.

698
02:21:03,302 --> 02:21:07,261
What do you want to say? That l am
lying? That it does not mean a thing?

699
02:21:08,307 --> 02:21:13,267
Yes, it does not mean a thing. And
you say that because you are a man

700
02:21:13,813 --> 02:21:19,217
who sins, but the woman has to bear
the consequences of that. l was the

701
02:21:19,752 --> 02:21:26,214
same depressed woman with a
burden. Amar not only married me

702
02:21:26,759 --> 02:21:32,220
but also gave me a power to feel
myself alive today.

703
02:21:35,268 --> 02:21:42,231
Wow, Pooja. You are a real lndian
wife. You will do anything to maintain

704
02:21:43,276 --> 02:21:48,236
your husband's image, no matter how
evil he is.

705
02:21:48,781 --> 02:21:50,248
Beware, Amar is....

706
02:21:50,783 --> 02:21:56,244
How can he give life to anyone? He
plays with others life for his own

707
02:21:57,290 --> 02:22:04,253
happiness. He tried to kill me to win
you. l was lucky that l did not die.

708
02:22:04,797 --> 02:22:10,258
But not even God can save him.

709
02:22:13,306 --> 02:22:16,207
Are you crazy?
Yes, l am Crazy. l am Crazy. l am

710
02:22:16,742 --> 02:22:21,202
burning in my own misery. lts your
Amar's fault. He tried to kill me. Vijay

711
02:22:21,747 --> 02:22:28,209
became Devaa due to your Amar. l
will kill him and his son.

712
02:22:40,266 --> 02:22:44,225
You cannot do that!
-l will do exactly that!

713
02:22:44,770 --> 02:22:48,228
Okay, then go and kill the memory of
our love.

714
02:22:51,277 --> 02:22:53,245
What do you mean?

715
02:23:00,286 --> 02:23:03,255
l am telling the truth. Rahul is your
son. Your own blood.

716
02:23:06,292 --> 02:23:08,260
Pooja, you are lying?

717
02:23:09,295 --> 02:23:14,255
No. And the person that you are
calling your murderer, he does not

718
02:23:14,734 --> 02:23:20,195
even know who planned this.

719
02:23:22,241 --> 02:23:27,201
Yes. Even l doubted him at first until
l realized that he is innocent. Had

720
02:23:27,747 --> 02:23:34,209
Amar not been there then, l would
have either committed suicide or l

721
02:23:34,754 --> 02:23:43,219
would have ended up in some bad
part of town with a bad reputation.

722
02:23:44,263 --> 02:23:52,227
Amar did not just give me a life, he
gave your son his name and a right

723
02:23:53,272 --> 02:24:02,237
to respectability in society. And here
you are, trying to kill such a nice man

724
02:24:04,283 --> 02:24:06,251
What have l done?

725
02:24:10,289 --> 02:24:16,194
l thought that my savior was my
murderer. Pooja, who had planned

726
02:24:16,729 --> 02:24:21,189
my death?

727
02:24:27,239 --> 02:24:30,174
My daddy.

728
02:24:36,248 --> 02:24:42,209
But why?
Amar had somehow convinced him

729
02:24:42,755 --> 02:24:47,215
about our wedding, but he couldn't
forget his old promise to his friend.

730
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:53,221
Enough Pooja. After hearing all this,
l have started hating myself.

731
02:24:58,270 --> 02:25:04,231
There is not much time. l will have to
go there before sunrise.

732
02:25:06,779 --> 02:25:08,246
Vijay, listen to me. Vijay!

733
02:27:08,267 --> 02:27:12,226
Vijay, l have come. Vijay.

734
02:27:29,221 --> 02:27:32,190
Nephew, l have also come here.

735
02:27:32,725 --> 02:27:35,193
Where is Vijay? Where is my son,
Kailasnath?

736
02:27:35,728 --> 02:27:39,186
You will get him. You forgot your
relations in caring for your son. After

737
02:27:39,732 --> 02:27:41,199
all, l am your uncle.

738
02:27:41,734 --> 02:27:45,192
Evil people like you can never be
anyone's uncles.

739
02:27:45,738 --> 02:27:51,199
You are stubborn and stupid just like
your father. l wanted to be near him,

740
02:27:51,744 --> 02:27:54,713
but he went near God. He wouldn't
come close to me at all.

741
02:27:55,247 --> 02:27:58,216
l don't want to hear your garbage.
just give me my child.

742
02:27:58,751 --> 02:28:01,219
Daddy! Daddy!
-Rahul!

743
02:28:03,255 --> 02:28:08,215
Kailasnath, if anything happens to
my son, l will not let you live.

744
02:29:24,203 --> 02:29:28,162
You like to trouble kids right? Now
see how l take you for a spin.

745
02:29:44,223 --> 02:29:48,182
Come here my child.
l want to go to My daddy.

746
02:29:48,727 --> 02:29:52,185
l am your daddy.
l want My daddy.

747
02:29:52,731 --> 02:29:56,189
l am your daddy.
Not you, l want My daddy.

748
02:29:56,735 --> 02:29:58,202
l will take you to your Daddy.

749
02:31:06,305 --> 02:31:08,273
Rahul, my son. Are you all right?
Yes daddy.

750
02:31:34,266 --> 02:31:36,234
Kailasnath!

751
02:31:58,290 --> 02:32:02,249
Pooja, l can't bear to see tears in
your eyes. l always want to see you

752
02:32:02,794 --> 02:32:05,262
happy.
Nothing will happen to you, my son.

753
02:32:10,302 --> 02:32:12,270
Amar, let me take you to the hospital

754
02:32:12,804 --> 02:32:18,208
Vijay, l am returning your love to you.

755
02:32:18,744 --> 02:32:26,207
Forgive me Amar. l am really
ashamed of myself.

756
02:32:28,253 --> 02:32:34,214
lt's not your fault, Vijay. lt's fate. You
got your Vijay. Today my wish is

757
02:32:34,760 --> 02:32:42,223
fulfilled. Are you going to send off
your childhood friend in tears?

758
02:32:48,273 --> 02:32:51,242
No Amar, l will not let you go. Statue!

759
02:32:53,278 --> 02:32:59,239
You are my childhood friend. l am
going to need you at every step of my

760
02:32:59,785 --> 02:33:06,247
life. Amar, you cannot leave me in
between. Released. Released Amar.

761
02:33:23,242 --> 02:33:29,203
Amar, l only loved Pooja. But you
have also worshipped Pooja in such

762
02:33:29,748 --> 02:33:35,209
a way that even the angels will bow
before you.
