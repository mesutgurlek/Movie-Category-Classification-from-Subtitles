1
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,948
Thanks. What's the idea
of the pictures, mister?

2
00:01:28,018 --> 00:01:30,077
<i>Life magazine's doing
a story on the theater.</i>

3
00:01:30,154 --> 00:01:32,782
Why didn't you tell me?
Look at my hair!

4
00:01:32,856 --> 00:01:34,551
What's so special
about this place?

5
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:35,785
It's news, soldier.

6
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:38,293
This theater went through the Blitz
and never missed a single performance.

7
00:01:38,362 --> 00:01:39,420
No kidding?

8
00:01:39,496 --> 00:01:41,794
Aye. And one of your
lassies is in on it, too.

9
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:44,762
Rosalind.

10
00:01:44,835 --> 00:01:46,735
She's an American.

11
00:01:47,771 --> 00:01:50,604
Wonderful thing,
lend-lease.

12
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,877
<i>I come into
the park each day</i>

13
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:04,443
<i>To watch the children
as they play</i>

14
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:07,752
<i>And see they don't go
near the water banks</i>

15
00:02:07,824 --> 00:02:09,655
<i>Although it never
was too hard</i>

16
00:02:09,726 --> 00:02:12,024
<i>To flirt with soldiers
on the guard</i>

17
00:02:12,095 --> 00:02:14,859
<i>I find it simpler still
to meet the Yanks</i>

18
00:02:15,432 --> 00:02:18,799
<i>This little high park bench</i>

19
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:23,469
<i>Is sometimes like a trench</i>

20
00:02:24,174 --> 00:02:26,608
<i>The Poles, the Czechs,
the Greeks</i>

21
00:02:26,677 --> 00:02:30,807
<i>Auditioning their techniques</i>

22
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,775
<i>First I embrace them
then I place them</i>

23
00:02:35,852 --> 00:02:38,650
<i>On an honor roll</i>

24
00:02:39,823 --> 00:02:42,291
<i>And the Yanks
always rate a spot</i>

25
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:45,488
<i>On my...</i>

26
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:50,094
<i>What does an English girI
think of a Yank?</i>

27
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:54,501
<i>For he's a doll and
Just as solid as it takes</i>

28
00:02:55,906 --> 00:03:00,172
<i>What does an English girI
think of his looks?</i>

29
00:03:00,244 --> 00:03:02,474
<i>And when he says,
"What's cooking?"</i>

30
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:04,946
<i>Does she know what cooks?</i>

31
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:08,216
<i>She Just adores
his Southern roar</i>

32
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:10,480
<i>Can't resist his
"Hi, y'all"</i>

33
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:11,748
<i>He says, "Evening, ma'am"</i>

34
00:03:11,822 --> 00:03:13,289
<i>She says, "Evening, Sam"</i>

35
00:03:13,357 --> 00:03:16,383
<i>That she's from Alabamy</i>

36
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,863
<i>What does an English girI
think of his Jive?</i>

37
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:23,422
<i>And when a band
is on the stand</i>

38
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,991
<i>Well, man alive</i>

39
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:27,502
<i>He knows from nothing</i>

40
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:28,868
<i>He starts rug-cutting</i>

41
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:30,839
<i>And throws a hip or two</i>

42
00:03:30,907 --> 00:03:34,172
<i>Do we hip bang?
Of course, we do</i>

43
00:04:58,695 --> 00:05:00,560
Mind if I get some
stuff from here, Sam?

44
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,530
Make yourself at home.

45
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:05,997
There isn't one of them girls that
couldn't be on the cover of your magazine.

46
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,505
Oh, can't you stay
off my feet?

47
00:05:09,573 --> 00:05:10,972
Hold it.

48
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:14,270
<i>Girls, we've made history.
Now we're making Life.</i>

49
00:05:14,344 --> 00:05:15,709
Wait till you see it.

50
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:18,111
A six-page spread glorifying
the Music Box Girls.

51
00:05:18,215 --> 00:05:19,876
Come on, girls.
We're on.

52
00:05:23,086 --> 00:05:24,986
Now, Miss Bruce, Just one
of you. Something informal.

53
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:26,522
Surely.

54
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:30,018
This ought to help
the circulation.

55
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:31,822
This'll do more for
the blood pressure.

56
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:35,462
Just one more.

57
00:05:35,532 --> 00:05:36,863
Sorry. I'm on again.

58
00:05:39,803 --> 00:05:41,168
Getting all the pictures
you want?

59
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:42,762
There's one I'd like to
get right now. The boss.

60
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,828
How about it,
Miss Tolliver?

61
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:46,404
The only pictures I've
taken now are X-rays.

62
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:47,966
Fine. We'll use them too.

63
00:05:48,745 --> 00:05:50,372
Anything about the woman
who kept this theater

64
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:53,245
going through the Blitz
is human interest.

65
00:05:54,818 --> 00:05:57,048
I'd like to get some from
up high with my view camera.

66
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,610
Sam, show him around.
I'll take over.

67
00:05:58,688 --> 00:06:00,246
Come along, young man.

68
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:13,097
You were here during
the Blitz, weren't you Sam?

69
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,467
That I was.

70
00:06:14,538 --> 00:06:15,562
How was it?

71
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,698
Well, you were gonna
take things as you find them.

72
00:06:17,808 --> 00:06:18,866
How did you
find them?

73
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:20,136
We didn't have to,
my boy.

74
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,235
They found us. There.

75
00:06:22,312 --> 00:06:23,336
Bombs, eh?

76
00:06:23,447 --> 00:06:25,347
Yes, incendiaries.

77
00:06:25,415 --> 00:06:26,575
Even that didn't
stop the show?

78
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,947
That it didn't.

79
00:06:28,018 --> 00:06:30,418
Actors are used to having
things thrown at them.

80
00:06:30,754 --> 00:06:33,120
I'd like to have had my camera
here when things were popping.

81
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,181
Well, you'd have got
some rare pictures.

82
00:06:35,258 --> 00:06:36,816
And a story to go
with it, I'll bet.

83
00:06:36,893 --> 00:06:39,327
Yes, and a story
to go with it.

84
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:41,088
Any special story, Sam?

85
00:06:41,364 --> 00:06:43,025
A very special story.

86
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,563
A story that'd make you laugh
if it didn't make you cry.

87
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,862
Would you like to hear it?

88
00:06:47,938 --> 00:06:49,496
That's what I'm here for.

89
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:52,770
Well, I'll have to go back before
the Blitz. Back before the war.

90
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:57,411
There was peace on Earth and bad
will among men, as you might say,

91
00:06:57,481 --> 00:06:59,472
but we knew the war
wasn't far off.

92
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,880
It was in rehearsal,
so to speak.

93
00:07:01,051 --> 00:07:02,416
<i>Like our new show.</i>

94
00:07:12,963 --> 00:07:17,093
TOLLIVER: Come on, Roz. Judy,
Angela, Toni, that's your cue.

95
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:20,468
All right, we'll take it
from the second four.

96
00:07:29,412 --> 00:07:30,640
Stop!

97
00:07:32,215 --> 00:07:35,275
Judy, darling. How
nice of you to drop in.

98
00:07:35,418 --> 00:07:37,181
And what a lovely hat.

99
00:07:37,888 --> 00:07:40,254
Now that we've all seen it,
you can take it off!

100
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:43,224
Well, you see, it was
this way, Tolly, I...

101
00:07:43,527 --> 00:07:47,657
When I call rehearsal at
10:00, I don't mean 10:30.

102
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:50,227
What's that?

103
00:07:53,937 --> 00:07:56,770
It's me, Mrs. Tolliver. I Just
got it back from the pawnbroker's.

104
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,898
I was practicing.

105
00:07:58,675 --> 00:08:01,075
I hired you as an electrician, didn't I?

106
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:04,278
But, Mrs. Tolliver, you can get
all the electricians you want,

107
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:06,542
but there's only one
xylophone player like me.

108
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:08,243
Well, that's encouraging.

109
00:08:08,318 --> 00:08:11,617
That's right. Now, put that thing
away and get back on your Job!

110
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:13,779
Very well, ma'am.

111
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:15,755
All right, girls,
we'll try it now.

112
00:08:16,126 --> 00:08:18,219
And I want no
further interruptions.

113
00:08:19,095 --> 00:08:21,120
There I'll give her right.

114
00:08:34,678 --> 00:08:36,441
What do you want?
Mrs. Tolliver?

115
00:08:36,513 --> 00:08:38,606
Yes? I have a letter from Mr. Halliday.

116
00:08:38,682 --> 00:08:39,671
Oh.

117
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:49,589
Is Jim Halliday
a friend of yours?

118
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:51,388
Well, I...
I know Mr. Halliday.

119
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:53,691
Obviously. What's more important
is has he seen you dance?

120
00:08:53,763 --> 00:08:54,855
Oh, yes.
Yes, several times.

121
00:08:54,931 --> 00:08:56,398
Where did you work?
The Globe.

122
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:57,865
What sort of thing
did you do there?

123
00:08:57,934 --> 00:08:59,265
I worked at a loom.

124
00:08:59,336 --> 00:09:01,167
But you Just said you danced
at the Globe Theatre.

125
00:09:01,237 --> 00:09:03,137
No, I said I worked
at the Globe.

126
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:05,834
That's Mr. Halliday's firm.
The Globe Cotton Mills.

127
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:08,343
But your dancing,
where did you dance?

128
00:09:08,411 --> 00:09:09,435
At the Globe.

129
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:11,744
TOLLIVER: How can you
dance at the Globe?

130
00:09:11,815 --> 00:09:13,680
The Globe's not a theater,
it's a cotton mill.

131
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,082
Well, you see, when you dance,
you must have a rhythm.

132
00:09:16,152 --> 00:09:18,120
Naturally.
And I worked at a loom.

133
00:09:18,188 --> 00:09:19,485
And there's a rhythm
to the way it works.

134
00:09:19,556 --> 00:09:21,922
And what, may I ask,
is your forte?

135
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:23,316
My what?

136
00:09:23,393 --> 00:09:24,860
I mean, what sort of
dancing do you do?

137
00:09:24,928 --> 00:09:27,897
Oh, I see. Well, none, really. What?

138
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:30,125
I dance pretty much
as I feel.

139
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,634
If I feel good, I dance.

140
00:09:33,136 --> 00:09:34,626
If I don't feel so good...

141
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:36,699
And how do you feel now?

142
00:09:37,173 --> 00:09:38,333
Hungry.

143
00:09:38,408 --> 00:09:40,467
I came up on the milk train
and I've had no breakfast.

144
00:09:40,543 --> 00:09:43,808
I think we should see this
NiJinsky from Manchester.

145
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,609
The name is Lawson.
Tommy Lawson.

146
00:09:45,682 --> 00:09:47,149
Give your music to the
pianist, Mr. Lawson.

147
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:48,275
Oh, I have no music.

148
00:09:48,351 --> 00:09:49,375
Then tell him what you
want him to play.

149
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,054
Well, I...
I don't rightly know.

150
00:09:52,322 --> 00:09:54,449
I'm sorry we haven't
a loom, Mr. Lawson.

151
00:09:56,026 --> 00:09:58,517
When you're not at the mill,
what do you dance to?

152
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:02,225
Oh, Beethoven, Mozart, Bach,
Gilbert and Sullivan.

153
00:10:02,298 --> 00:10:03,663
Whatever's coming in
over the radio.

154
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:06,433
Now I've heard everything.
Sam.

155
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:09,663
Bring me your wireless.

156
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:11,934
Move back, girls,
and give him room.

157
00:10:12,008 --> 00:10:14,169
Young man,
the stage is yours.

158
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:15,438
Thank you.

159
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:13,256
Oh, no, no, no. Leave it
alone. I often dance to him.

160
00:13:14,123 --> 00:13:15,920
Very interesting,
young man.

161
00:13:15,992 --> 00:13:18,051
That trick thing
you did on the stairs.

162
00:13:18,127 --> 00:13:19,594
Will you do it
again, please?

163
00:13:19,996 --> 00:13:22,055
I don't think I can.
TOLLIVER: What do you mean?

164
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:24,258
Well, I don't
remember the steps.

165
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:26,029
I Just make them up
as I go along.

166
00:13:27,403 --> 00:13:30,895
You have talent, young man, but
it's a Sunday-driver sort of talent.

167
00:13:30,974 --> 00:13:32,100
I wouldn't know
how to use it.

168
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:35,872
Half an hour, everybody,
and be back on time.

169
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:37,978
Tolly.
What is it?

170
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:40,515
You're crazy if you let
that boy go. He's wonderful.

171
00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:43,811
Give him a chance, Tolly. Think
of what he can do for the show.

172
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:46,015
That's what I'm afraid of.

173
00:13:49,826 --> 00:13:51,657
Hey, Manchester,
wait a minute.

174
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:53,460
Don't let Tolly
get you down.

175
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:54,962
I've been a dancer
all my life,

176
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:56,896
and I know dancing
when I see it.

177
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:58,058
Well, I'm glad
you liked it.

178
00:13:58,134 --> 00:13:59,567
Hold on a minute.
I liked it too.

179
00:13:59,636 --> 00:14:00,864
Oh, I meant you too.

180
00:14:00,937 --> 00:14:02,336
But you've got to
set a routine

181
00:14:02,405 --> 00:14:04,066
and do it exactly the
same way every time.

182
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,402
And you must remember it.

183
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:06,999
It's no good. I'm going back to my loom.

184
00:14:07,076 --> 00:14:09,544
Look, if you go back
home now, you're licked.

185
00:14:09,612 --> 00:14:11,409
You've got something to sell. Sell it.

186
00:14:11,481 --> 00:14:13,210
You're very kind,
both of you.

187
00:14:13,283 --> 00:14:15,649
But this business of dancing the
same way all the time, I can't...

188
00:14:15,718 --> 00:14:16,776
You can do it.

189
00:14:16,853 --> 00:14:18,650
We're going to teach you
everything you know.

190
00:14:18,788 --> 00:14:19,777
Go ahead, Judy.

191
00:14:19,856 --> 00:14:21,323
Now watch me.

192
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:32,601
Got it?
Got it.

193
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:33,727
Go ahead, try it.

194
00:14:33,803 --> 00:14:35,168
All right.

195
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,168
Well, I've seen better
and I've seen worse.

196
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,338
Now that's a bit
of all right.

197
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:46,712
How do you know?

198
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:50,879
How do I know? I've worked
in the theater 15 years.

199
00:14:50,954 --> 00:14:51,943
What do you know?

200
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:53,045
What do I know?

201
00:14:53,122 --> 00:14:55,352
Haven't I worked with some of the
biggest managers in this business?

202
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:57,985
Go on. You cleaned their
theaters, that's what.

203
00:14:58,061 --> 00:15:00,757
Well, they never did nothing
without asking me, "What about it?"

204
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,320
Come off it.

205
00:15:02,398 --> 00:15:04,593
"Mrs. Peabody," they'd say.

206
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,635
"In or out?"

207
00:15:06,903 --> 00:15:08,063
And it was usually out.

208
00:15:08,137 --> 00:15:09,764
Well, what do you
think now, Mrs. Peabody?

209
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,898
Ma'am, you did give me
a nasty turn.

210
00:15:11,975 --> 00:15:14,000
Well, what do you think?

211
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:16,400
In.

212
00:15:54,017 --> 00:15:55,780
Put that light out.

213
00:15:56,819 --> 00:15:58,810
Don't you know
there's a war on?

214
00:15:58,888 --> 00:16:00,014
Sorry, Mr. Warden.

215
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:01,681
It was my fault.

216
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:03,919
I Just wanted to see our
names in lights before...

217
00:16:29,886 --> 00:16:33,219
Pilot to navigator. Pilot to
navigator. Where the devil are we?

218
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:36,224
Can't get my bearings
in this bottle of ink.

219
00:16:40,963 --> 00:16:42,396
Wow!

220
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:44,697
Gentlemen, we seem to have
located an obJective.

221
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:46,234
Our target
for tonight, sir?

222
00:16:46,302 --> 00:16:48,327
We can try, gentlemen.
We can try.

223
00:16:48,404 --> 00:16:50,167
Changing course, sir.

224
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,390
<i>You excite me</i>

225
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:21,995
<i>Beyond my power
to explain</i>

226
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:25,905
<i>Yours is the art
to start my heart</i>

227
00:17:25,975 --> 00:17:29,843
<i>A bubbling
like champagne</i>

228
00:17:30,713 --> 00:17:33,648
<i>You excite me</i>

229
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:38,346
<i>And there is nothing
I can do</i>

230
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:42,388
<i>When you appear
I hear a cheer</i>

231
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:46,895
<i>Like thunder in the blue</i>

232
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:51,422
<i>When we dispeI we</i>

233
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:55,594
<i>I fear to stay
and hate to leave</i>

234
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:58,367
<i>You excite me</i>

235
00:17:58,441 --> 00:18:03,140
<i>You lead me on
and I pursue</i>

236
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:07,772
<i>The dye is cast
It's too fantastic</i>

237
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:13,186
<i>Yet it's true</i>

238
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,115
<i>Am I right?</i>

239
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:23,064
<i>Am I exciting you?</i>

240
00:19:39,342 --> 00:19:42,106
<i>You excite me</i>

241
00:19:42,178 --> 00:19:47,115
<i>You lead me on
and I pursue</i>

242
00:19:47,183 --> 00:19:50,710
<i>The dye is cast
It's too fantastic</i>

243
00:19:50,786 --> 00:19:52,617
<i>Yet it's true</i>

244
00:19:55,057 --> 00:19:56,456
<i>Am I right?</i>

245
00:19:56,525 --> 00:20:01,428
<i>Am I exciting you?</i>

246
00:20:19,181 --> 00:20:22,480
Bert, cut your finale short.
Here they come again.

247
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:25,020
Well, can I help it
if they're early?

248
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:32,016
Ladies and gentlemen, there's
a shelter under the stage.

249
00:20:32,094 --> 00:20:34,892
Just pass through the doors at
each side of the theater. Thank you.

250
00:20:45,107 --> 00:20:46,904
This way, gentlemen.

251
00:20:46,976 --> 00:20:49,308
Come on, boys.
We've been invited to stay.

252
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,180
How do you do, Mrs. Good?
Straight ahead.

253
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,048
Right turn down there. Right
on down to the basement, folks.

254
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,458
No, sir. This way, sir.
Right on down, sir.

255
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:07,595
This way. Right turn, right
on down to the basement.

256
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:09,460
Move along now, folks.

257
00:21:09,732 --> 00:21:12,792
I wish I had my makeup off
and was home in bed.

258
00:21:12,868 --> 00:21:14,836
Well, wishing
won't get you there.

259
00:21:14,904 --> 00:21:16,531
Nor you either, chum.

260
00:21:16,605 --> 00:21:18,334
I haven't slept a wink for nights.

261
00:21:18,774 --> 00:21:21,538
Oh, neither have I.
I'm exhausted.

262
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,875
Last night, the man next
to me snored for hours.

263
00:21:26,682 --> 00:21:29,207
I'll never sleep
in the underground again.

264
00:21:32,588 --> 00:21:34,988
Alfred, don't make
so much noise.

265
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:37,887
Sorry, is that yours?

266
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,861
You mean to say you've never heard
of The Great Waldo and his xylophone?

267
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,659
Can't say I have.
That's me.

268
00:21:42,732 --> 00:21:45,326
Twenty years ago.
And this is my xylophone.

269
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:47,232
We were a great act.
Evidently.

270
00:21:47,303 --> 00:21:48,793
A great act.

271
00:21:49,905 --> 00:21:51,304
Sorry.

272
00:22:05,988 --> 00:22:07,046
Excuse me.

273
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,221
Scared?

274
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:43,758
Naturally.

275
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:45,483
So am I.

276
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:48,519
Well, that's
not very comforting.

277
00:22:48,597 --> 00:22:49,894
That's like
having a lifeguard say

278
00:22:49,965 --> 00:22:51,023
he's afraid of the water.

279
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,591
Oh, I don't mean this.
I mean you.

280
00:22:55,171 --> 00:22:57,139
You did a little
bombing tonight yourself,

281
00:22:57,206 --> 00:22:58,468
you know.

282
00:22:58,908 --> 00:23:00,034
That dance you did.

283
00:23:03,312 --> 00:23:05,803
In fact, you bombed
from a very low altitude.

284
00:23:05,881 --> 00:23:08,441
It was not only unfair,
it was practically illegal.

285
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:09,882
Well, I'm sorry.

286
00:23:09,952 --> 00:23:11,351
You should be.

287
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:14,586
I hope I didn't
hit anything vital.

288
00:23:14,657 --> 00:23:16,420
You knocked out
my whole communicating system,

289
00:23:16,492 --> 00:23:17,618
if that's any concern to you.

290
00:23:19,261 --> 00:23:20,751
I think you should
have supper with me

291
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,390
and sort of help put me
together again, don't you?

292
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,724
No.

293
00:23:26,168 --> 00:23:27,226
You don't?

294
00:23:27,903 --> 00:23:28,995
No.

295
00:23:29,071 --> 00:23:31,369
You haven't any conscience
at all, have you?

296
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,034
I have a perfectly
beautiful conscience

297
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:35,474
but I also have a date.

298
00:23:36,545 --> 00:23:38,035
Yeah, naturally.

299
00:23:38,347 --> 00:23:40,247
But you could switch it.

300
00:23:40,316 --> 00:23:43,080
I've only got tonight
and tomorrow night.

301
00:23:43,152 --> 00:23:44,141
I'm sorry, but I...

302
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,744
Have you ever been
to the 299 Club?

303
00:23:45,821 --> 00:23:46,845
Never.

304
00:23:46,922 --> 00:23:48,082
You'll like it enormously.

305
00:23:48,157 --> 00:23:49,317
I've no doubt
about it, but...

306
00:23:49,391 --> 00:23:50,517
They've got
the hottest band in London,

307
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:51,992
imported from America.

308
00:23:52,061 --> 00:23:53,551
You are an American,
aren't you?

309
00:23:54,497 --> 00:23:55,555
St. Louis.

310
00:23:55,631 --> 00:23:58,259
<i>Wait till you hear that band
play the St. Louis Blues.</i>

311
00:23:58,334 --> 00:24:00,598
It'll sound like
a letter from home.

312
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:03,103
For a man whose communicating
system is out of order,

313
00:24:03,172 --> 00:24:04,639
you're doing awfully well.

314
00:24:04,707 --> 00:24:05,696
Am I?

315
00:24:05,774 --> 00:24:07,833
What must you be like
when it's working?

316
00:24:08,777 --> 00:24:09,766
You'll see.

317
00:24:09,845 --> 00:24:13,508
Tolly, that last one got the
Cumberland Theater. A direct hit.

318
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:15,379
That's the first hit
they've had in 10 years.

319
00:24:17,753 --> 00:24:19,277
All clear!

320
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:24,292
Goodnight, Tolly.

321
00:24:25,227 --> 00:24:26,956
TOLLIVER:
Good night, girls.

322
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,565
Roz, I've got to make a telephone
call to the sector chief.

323
00:24:34,637 --> 00:24:37,003
You and Judy
go ahead to Philippe's.

324
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,468
Oh, by the way,
goodnight.

325
00:24:42,511 --> 00:24:43,671
You don't really mean that?

326
00:24:43,746 --> 00:24:45,043
I mean Just that.

327
00:24:45,114 --> 00:24:47,378
I wish you
a very good night.

328
00:25:07,303 --> 00:25:09,294
Do you know something? You
are a very, very naughty child.

329
00:25:09,538 --> 00:25:11,199
Why? Why did you not tell Annette?

330
00:25:11,273 --> 00:25:12,706
I would've fixed you...
What?

331
00:25:12,775 --> 00:25:14,572
...a really big celebration.
Celebration?

332
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:17,237
And you are Just
as bad as she is.

333
00:25:17,313 --> 00:25:18,803
Why keep away from me
those secrets?

334
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:20,576
What are you talking about, Annette?

335
00:25:23,352 --> 00:25:24,944
Many happy returns
of the day.

336
00:25:25,921 --> 00:25:28,014
A little birthday party
for you.

337
00:25:28,424 --> 00:25:29,413
Oh.

338
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:35,129
Hmm. Very nice.

339
00:25:36,565 --> 00:25:38,829
Champagne. Flowers.

340
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:40,869
How beautiful. And
look, Judy, candy too.

341
00:25:40,936 --> 00:25:42,460
Oh, it's really nothing.

342
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:44,870
Too bad.
It isn't my birthday.

343
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,239
It isn't? What do you know
about that, Madame Annette?

344
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,368
It's not her birthday.

345
00:25:49,445 --> 00:25:50,639
No?

346
00:25:50,713 --> 00:25:53,546
<i>Oh, I get it. You're the
clever one, mon brave.</i>

347
00:25:53,616 --> 00:25:55,607
Such a pity.
Oh, please stay.

348
00:25:55,684 --> 00:25:58,619
Well, if you decide
it is your birthday, Roz,

349
00:25:58,687 --> 00:25:59,984
I'll meet Tommy
somewhere else.

350
00:26:00,055 --> 00:26:02,114
Oh, no. I'm expecting all of you. Oh?

351
00:26:02,191 --> 00:26:03,283
We might as well, Judy.

352
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:05,020
If I don't admit it's my
birthday, I shudder to think

353
00:26:05,094 --> 00:26:06,959
what holiday
he might declare.

354
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:08,360
Intelligent girl.

355
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,456
Oh, no. No, I know when
I'm licked, that's all.

356
00:26:12,301 --> 00:26:13,290
Here we are.

357
00:26:13,369 --> 00:26:15,798
Thank you.

358
00:26:15,904 --> 00:26:17,166
Mmm.

359
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:18,263
For you.

360
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,001
Champagne.

361
00:26:20,075 --> 00:26:21,975
What are you trying to do,
launch something?

362
00:26:22,044 --> 00:26:24,205
That's an idea.

363
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:27,442
I christen thee beautiful
friendship, very beautiful.

364
00:26:27,516 --> 00:26:30,076
He's very charming,
your aviator.

365
00:26:30,152 --> 00:26:33,121
<i>Thank you, Annette. Vive
la Francel Free French.</i>

366
00:26:33,188 --> 00:26:34,985
<i>Vive I'amour.</i>

367
00:26:35,057 --> 00:26:36,854
I remember
during the last war.

368
00:26:36,925 --> 00:26:40,486
<i>There was an aviator Just
such a one as you, monsieur.</i>

369
00:26:40,562 --> 00:26:42,086
So watch out!

370
00:26:45,601 --> 00:26:47,967
I been hearing nothing from
you for the past three days,

371
00:26:48,037 --> 00:26:50,471
except that you're
a Blitz grandmother.

372
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:53,133
Blown clean out of bed,
my daughter was.

373
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:55,642
And her baby was born
underneath it.

374
00:26:55,711 --> 00:26:58,805
The air raid warden said it must
have been a special kind of a bomb.

375
00:26:58,881 --> 00:27:00,576
Hitler's secret weapon,
I suppose.

376
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:03,311
What? It ain't everybody that
can have a baby in an air raid.

377
00:27:03,385 --> 00:27:05,512
Well, it could
happen to anyone.

378
00:27:05,587 --> 00:27:07,384
I'd like to
see it happen to me!

379
00:27:07,456 --> 00:27:08,684
Goodnight, Mr. Lawson.
Goodnight.

380
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:09,746
Goodnight.

381
00:27:09,825 --> 00:27:11,622
ROSALIND: Come in.

382
00:27:15,264 --> 00:27:17,391
Mmm-hmm. Let me take a look at you.

383
00:27:18,534 --> 00:27:19,933
What you can
do to a dress!

384
00:27:20,002 --> 00:27:21,196
Thank you, Tommy.

385
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,259
You know,
I was Just thinking.

386
00:27:22,337 --> 00:27:24,931
If I saw you somewhere
and didn't know you...

387
00:27:25,007 --> 00:27:26,702
I'm awfully glad
I know you, Roz.

388
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:28,072
So am I, Tommy.

389
00:27:28,143 --> 00:27:30,236
If only someone from Manchester
could be in Philippe's

390
00:27:30,312 --> 00:27:31,870
to see me
walk in with you.

391
00:27:31,947 --> 00:27:35,508
Oh, I'm sorry, Tommy, but I can't
have supper with you and Judy.

392
00:27:35,584 --> 00:27:37,313
I have a date.
The Air Force again?

393
00:27:37,386 --> 00:27:38,410
Mmm-hmm.

394
00:27:38,487 --> 00:27:39,977
Whose birthday
is it tonight?

395
00:27:40,055 --> 00:27:41,113
Nobody's.

396
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,953
No, of course not.
What is it this time?

397
00:27:43,025 --> 00:27:45,823
His uncle's silver wedding
or the Chinese New Year?

398
00:27:46,361 --> 00:27:48,022
No, it's old home week.

399
00:27:48,097 --> 00:27:50,588
I'm going to meet a fellow from
his outfit. His name's Chuck Brown.

400
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:52,133
And he's from St. Louis,
same as me.

401
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:53,463
Oh, no, Roz.

402
00:27:53,535 --> 00:27:55,799
Sure he is. It's a
small world, isn't it?

403
00:27:56,338 --> 00:27:57,669
I'm disappointed in him.

404
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,367
I thought he'd pull
a better one than that.

405
00:27:59,608 --> 00:28:01,075
Who?
Lundy.

406
00:28:01,143 --> 00:28:03,805
Roz, that's the oldest
dodge in the world.

407
00:28:05,013 --> 00:28:06,674
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

408
00:28:07,483 --> 00:28:09,713
Perhaps there is
a Chuck Brown.

409
00:28:09,785 --> 00:28:11,844
Of course there is,
or Paul wouldn't say so.

410
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,444
Well, where
are you meeting?

411
00:28:13,522 --> 00:28:14,716
I don't know. Why?

412
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,189
I'll bet
it's his apartment.

413
00:28:16,258 --> 00:28:18,055
It's such a comfortable
place to wait.

414
00:28:18,127 --> 00:28:20,061
In case
Mr. Brown is delayed.

415
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:22,427
I'll also bet you that
sometime during the evening

416
00:28:22,498 --> 00:28:24,193
there'll be a convenient
message from Mr. Brown...

417
00:28:24,266 --> 00:28:25,790
Thanks, Tommy.

418
00:28:26,668 --> 00:28:29,296
But I think I'm as good a
Judge of people as you are.

419
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:30,963
Woman's intuition, eh?

420
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,199
That's right.

421
00:28:32,274 --> 00:28:35,675
Woman's intuition is an old
established custom, Tommy.

422
00:28:38,313 --> 00:28:39,507
Good night, Judy.

423
00:28:39,581 --> 00:28:41,173
Good night, Roz.

424
00:28:46,522 --> 00:28:48,387
You two been having a row? Oh, no, no.

425
00:28:48,457 --> 00:28:50,857
Just bustling her off
to meet Prince Charming.

426
00:28:50,926 --> 00:28:51,915
Oh.

427
00:28:52,294 --> 00:28:54,785
Shows what a uniform can do.

428
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:58,156
I like your eyes,
even if the army doesn't.

429
00:28:58,233 --> 00:29:01,396
Come on, Tommy. I've
got a date too, you know.

430
00:29:11,914 --> 00:29:13,541
Thank you, sir.
All right.

431
00:29:17,986 --> 00:29:19,783
Uh-uh, mustn't smile.

432
00:29:19,855 --> 00:29:23,086
It lights up the street so much
the warden will be running us in.

433
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,518
We're going to have supper
at my apartment.

434
00:29:26,595 --> 00:29:27,789
It's more comfortable there.

435
00:29:27,863 --> 00:29:29,228
Temple Gardens.

436
00:29:37,372 --> 00:29:39,067
Now you can smile.

437
00:29:52,387 --> 00:29:53,479
Good evening.

438
00:29:53,555 --> 00:29:54,783
Beg pardon, sir.

439
00:29:54,857 --> 00:29:57,087
Yes? This letter came for you, sir.

440
00:29:57,159 --> 00:29:59,787
A gentleman from the
Royal Air Force left it.

441
00:29:59,862 --> 00:30:01,124
Thank you.

442
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:11,835
Here's where I lived
before I Joined up.

443
00:30:12,608 --> 00:30:14,075
It's very nice.

444
00:30:14,643 --> 00:30:17,339
Oh, you've no idea how your
being in it improves it.

445
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,375
Make yourself at home. I'll
find us something to drink.

446
00:30:20,449 --> 00:30:22,474
Aren't you going to
read your note?

447
00:30:22,551 --> 00:30:24,280
Oh, may I?

448
00:30:25,354 --> 00:30:27,754
Of course.
It might be something...

449
00:30:27,823 --> 00:30:29,757
Well, unexpected.

450
00:30:31,026 --> 00:30:32,755
No, I, I rather
expected this.

451
00:30:32,828 --> 00:30:34,625
It's from
a very forgetful man.

452
00:30:34,696 --> 00:30:37,392
I'll be right back.
I suppose you'd like ice?

453
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:23,077
I want to warn you, this
really isn't a cocktail.

454
00:31:23,145 --> 00:31:25,807
It's a deadly love potion, brewed
from an ancient recipe that...

455
00:31:26,715 --> 00:31:28,342
What's the matter?

456
00:31:29,084 --> 00:31:30,984
I Just did something awful.

457
00:31:31,053 --> 00:31:32,213
Impossible.

458
00:31:32,287 --> 00:31:33,618
I read your letter.

459
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:38,550
It's awfully bad manners and I never
did anything like that before but I...

460
00:31:38,627 --> 00:31:41,187
I Just had to,
don't you see?

461
00:31:41,263 --> 00:31:45,427
Well, there's no reason why you
shouldn't have read it if you wanted to.

462
00:31:46,368 --> 00:31:49,201
It was Just from...
I know, but...

463
00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:53,630
For goodness' sakes,
give me a drink.

464
00:32:00,515 --> 00:32:02,813
You know, at home, I used
to read books about England.

465
00:32:02,884 --> 00:32:05,546
The hero always lived
in rooms like this.

466
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:09,285
Fine old building
with lots of tradition.

467
00:32:09,358 --> 00:32:12,350
Cheerful fire,
oak-paneled walls.

468
00:32:13,095 --> 00:32:15,586
Old, worn
leather armchairs.

469
00:32:15,664 --> 00:32:17,529
Solid and substantial.

470
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:21,201
It's very reassuring.
Oh?

471
00:32:26,108 --> 00:32:27,541
Yes?

472
00:32:27,609 --> 00:32:28,803
Of course.
Send him up at once.

473
00:32:35,217 --> 00:32:36,775
Who's that?

474
00:32:36,852 --> 00:32:38,251
My father.

475
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,153
He doesn't look as if
he likes me very much.

476
00:32:41,223 --> 00:32:42,850
Well, if he looks
a bit startled,

477
00:32:42,924 --> 00:32:45,552
you're probably the first actress
he's ever seen in his life.

478
00:32:47,162 --> 00:32:48,322
Excuse me.

479
00:32:57,672 --> 00:32:59,833
Anything more, sir? No, that'll
be all. Thanks. Good night.

480
00:32:59,908 --> 00:33:01,341
Good night, sir.

481
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,570
Good night, Miss.

482
00:33:02,644 --> 00:33:04,134
If we get hungry.

483
00:33:10,786 --> 00:33:12,811
He isn't coming, is he? Who?

484
00:33:12,888 --> 00:33:14,116
Chuck Brown.

485
00:33:14,189 --> 00:33:16,020
Oh darling, you really
wouldn't have liked him at all.

486
00:33:16,091 --> 00:33:17,581
Very rude fellow.
Not your type.

487
00:33:17,893 --> 00:33:21,294
Of course, I didn't find
all these things out until...

488
00:33:21,363 --> 00:33:24,855
Rosalind, please, say
you're glad he isn't coming.

489
00:33:26,835 --> 00:33:28,166
Doesn't matter.

490
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,332
Rosalind.

491
00:33:33,408 --> 00:33:36,468
I discovered something very
interesting tonight. Do you know that?

492
00:33:36,545 --> 00:33:37,807
What?

493
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:40,746
That woman's intuition
is highly overrated.

494
00:33:41,383 --> 00:33:42,941
I've discovered
something too.

495
00:33:43,318 --> 00:33:44,307
Really?

496
00:33:44,386 --> 00:33:46,445
Well, don't you want
to hear what it is?

497
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:48,887
It's something you
yourself said last night.

498
00:33:48,957 --> 00:33:50,857
I? What?

499
00:33:50,926 --> 00:33:52,416
Listen.

500
00:33:59,301 --> 00:34:00,962
<i>You excite me</i>

501
00:34:01,036 --> 00:34:05,063
<i>Beyond my power to explain</i>

502
00:34:06,608 --> 00:34:10,408
<i>Yours is the art
to start my heart</i>

503
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:14,745
<i>A bubbling like champagne</i>

504
00:34:15,217 --> 00:34:16,707
<i>You ex...</i>

505
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,988
I'm glad this is not an
example of British strategy,

506
00:34:28,063 --> 00:34:31,226
or I'd be very worried
about the outcome of the war.

507
00:34:41,009 --> 00:34:42,533
Hello.

508
00:34:42,611 --> 00:34:43,873
Hello!

509
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:51,409
You're home early.

510
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,150
Oh, is it early?
I hadn't noticed.

511
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,757
Didn't you have
a nice time?

512
00:35:00,295 --> 00:35:02,388
Oh, sure, grand.

513
00:35:02,464 --> 00:35:04,295
Well, tell me about it.
Where did you go?

514
00:35:05,267 --> 00:35:09,363
Oh, well, we ended up
at Paul's apartment.

515
00:35:27,189 --> 00:35:29,817
There wasn't any man
from St. Louis.

516
00:35:29,891 --> 00:35:33,156
He didn't show up, he
wasn't meant to show up.

517
00:35:34,296 --> 00:35:36,958
It was Just one of
Paul's little ideas.

518
00:35:48,043 --> 00:35:50,671
It was Just one
of those things.

519
00:35:50,745 --> 00:35:53,509
I thought Paul
was different. But...

520
00:35:54,482 --> 00:35:58,145
Oh, Judy, how I wanted
him to be different.

521
00:36:14,202 --> 00:36:17,467
To be here,
or not to be here,

522
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:19,530
that is the question,
old man.

523
00:36:19,608 --> 00:36:22,168
No, old boy,
that's the answer.

524
00:36:33,221 --> 00:36:35,746
What's happened to my call to
the Music Box Theatre, London?

525
00:36:35,824 --> 00:36:37,917
I've been waiting
more than...

526
00:36:39,794 --> 00:36:42,354
But she can't refuse
the call, can she?

527
00:36:44,766 --> 00:36:46,666
Oh, she can.

528
00:36:49,237 --> 00:36:51,068
These are for you, sir, they're
marked, "Return to sender. "

529
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:52,766
Yes, I know. I know.
What shall I do?

530
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,508
Well, have you a mother?

531
00:36:54,576 --> 00:36:55,600
Why, yes, sir.
That's it.

532
00:36:55,677 --> 00:36:56,974
Thank you, sir.

533
00:36:57,045 --> 00:36:58,774
<i>You excite me</i>

534
00:36:58,847 --> 00:37:02,374
<i>Beyond my power
to explain</i>

535
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:05,385
<i>Yours is the art
to start my heart</i>

536
00:37:05,453 --> 00:37:07,546
<i>A bubbling
like champagne</i>

537
00:37:10,058 --> 00:37:14,256
It's sensational, sir.
Music, dancing, girls.

538
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:16,229
Everything the men want.

539
00:37:17,966 --> 00:37:21,197
Oh, I don't know. We've got
Shakespeare booked on Sunday.

540
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:25,664
I'm not saying a word against
Shakespeare, he's very well thought of.

541
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,106
But a thing like this
has its points too, sir.

542
00:37:28,176 --> 00:37:31,077
I mean, in its own way,
it's quite educational.

543
00:37:31,613 --> 00:37:33,979
I'll put in a request
for them.

544
00:37:36,084 --> 00:37:38,109
Thank you very much, sir.

545
00:37:39,788 --> 00:37:42,086
Oh, could you
mark it "urgent," sir,

546
00:37:42,157 --> 00:37:44,250
in case any of the young
ladies has other plans?

547
00:37:45,226 --> 00:37:46,784
What?

548
00:37:46,861 --> 00:37:48,590
Oh, yes. Yes, quite.

549
00:38:07,615 --> 00:38:09,378
I'm sorry.

550
00:38:09,551 --> 00:38:11,280
They really gave it
to us tonight.

551
00:38:11,353 --> 00:38:13,218
The streets are full
of bricks and glass.

552
00:38:13,288 --> 00:38:16,052
We can't even get home.
This is the last straw.

553
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:19,616
Oh, I can't remember when
I've had a good night's sleep.

554
00:38:19,694 --> 00:38:21,286
Well, aren't
the buses running?

555
00:38:21,363 --> 00:38:22,421
Nothing's running.

556
00:38:22,497 --> 00:38:23,759
Nothing's even walking.

557
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,602
Well, look who's here.
Mary, queen of the war effort.

558
00:38:31,706 --> 00:38:32,695
Where's the colonel?

559
00:38:32,774 --> 00:38:34,605
Waiting for me
at the 299 Club.

560
00:38:34,676 --> 00:38:36,906
My taxi couldn't
get through.

561
00:38:36,978 --> 00:38:39,105
Why didn't he send
a tank for you?

562
00:38:41,716 --> 00:38:45,152
I don't know what my ma
will say, not going home.

563
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,744
So you had to
come back too?

564
00:38:46,821 --> 00:38:49,221
Couldn't take the girls to supper
and we couldn't take them home

565
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,520
so we brought them
back to you.

566
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,657
It's no good, children,
we can't go on like this.

567
00:38:53,728 --> 00:38:55,821
It's going to get worse
instead of better.

568
00:38:55,897 --> 00:38:57,865
You're not gonna close
the Music Box, are you?

569
00:38:57,932 --> 00:38:59,797
What about us?
Ain't we got our rights?

570
00:38:59,868 --> 00:39:01,062
It's easy for you chaps.

571
00:39:01,136 --> 00:39:04,105
You're only in for one show,
we do five a day.

572
00:39:04,172 --> 00:39:05,161
Don't close up.

573
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,639
There aren't many
theaters left open.

574
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:09,108
I'm on a minesweeper. These
shows are nice to come home to.

575
00:39:09,177 --> 00:39:10,804
You can't do it, Tolly.
They're right.

576
00:39:10,879 --> 00:39:12,437
If they wanna come,
you've got to stay open.

577
00:39:16,918 --> 00:39:18,783
I don't know how
we're going to do it,

578
00:39:18,853 --> 00:39:20,514
but if that's the way
you want it, lads,

579
00:39:20,588 --> 00:39:22,453
we'll have a try at it.

580
00:39:22,857 --> 00:39:24,222
All right, girls, say
goodnight to your friends.

581
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:25,486
Goodnight, boys.

582
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,870
Well, wake me up for
the first show, somebody.

583
00:39:43,545 --> 00:39:45,206
My poor dogs,
are they barking!

584
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,544
I could sleep
standing up.

585
00:39:47,615 --> 00:39:50,175
Well, it's better than trying to
get home. That's all I can say.

586
00:39:50,251 --> 00:39:51,741
If we've still got a home.

587
00:39:53,755 --> 00:39:55,814
Of course
we've got a home.

588
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:58,415
What's the matter with staying
right here in the theater?

589
00:39:58,493 --> 00:40:01,189
Live in the theater? But
what about my social life?

590
00:40:01,596 --> 00:40:03,996
No, thanks, I'm not
running any home for actors.

591
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:06,364
Oh, we won't be
any trouble, Tolly.

592
00:40:06,434 --> 00:40:08,664
All we have to do is put
mattresses in the dressing rooms.

593
00:40:08,736 --> 00:40:11,637
I can imagine you people
together 24 hours a day.

594
00:40:11,706 --> 00:40:13,037
A thing like that
breeds murder.

595
00:40:13,107 --> 00:40:15,473
Oh, we'd behave
like lambs, Tolly.

596
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:16,908
We could pool
our ration points

597
00:40:16,978 --> 00:40:19,446
and rig up a kitchen
and canteen upstairs.

598
00:40:19,514 --> 00:40:21,175
Come on, Tolly,
it'd be fun.

599
00:40:25,286 --> 00:40:27,686
Very well. If all of you
want to try it, I'll agree.

600
00:40:28,523 --> 00:40:31,515
You've made your beds, now you
can sleep in them. Good night.

601
00:40:31,593 --> 00:40:32,992
Good night!

602
00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:43,762
<i>You feeI you'd
like to drop</i>

603
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:45,931
<i>But you must never stop</i>

604
00:40:46,007 --> 00:40:47,736
<i>Just go on with the fight</i>

605
00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:49,834
<i>Tonight and every night</i>

606
00:40:58,653 --> 00:41:01,087
<i>When all is said and done</i>

607
00:41:01,155 --> 00:41:02,986
<i>Let's have some fun</i>

608
00:41:03,057 --> 00:41:07,391
<i>Tonight and every night</i>

609
00:41:16,337 --> 00:41:18,601
Everybody up!
Come on, girls.

610
00:41:18,673 --> 00:41:21,267
Eight o'clock. Up you get. Show a leg.

611
00:41:21,342 --> 00:41:22,741
ROSALIND: Oh, have
a heart, Sam.

612
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:25,040
Can't we even sleep
on Sunday morning?

613
00:41:25,179 --> 00:41:26,339
Not this Sunday,
you can't.

614
00:41:26,414 --> 00:41:28,473
You've got a date with
the Air Force. All of you.

615
00:41:40,662 --> 00:41:42,562
Well, I've seen
better landings.

616
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:45,155
Sorry, sir. Not bad,
we made it in 55 minutes.

617
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,629
We're in luck, sir.
The show's still on.

618
00:41:47,702 --> 00:41:51,866
Yes. I'm afraid my devotion to the
drama isn't as great as yours, Lundy.

619
00:41:53,608 --> 00:41:56,304
I suppose you want me to take
these reports to Control, sir.

620
00:41:56,377 --> 00:41:57,935
No. Never mind.

621
00:41:58,012 --> 00:42:00,537
The war's taken up quite enough
of your time this evening, Lundy.

622
00:42:00,748 --> 00:42:02,375
Thank you very much, sir.

623
00:42:23,438 --> 00:42:25,463
<i>Before the bugle blows</i>

624
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,768
<i>Lights out</i>

625
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:32,445
<i>We have some time
to think about</i>

626
00:42:32,747 --> 00:42:37,116
<i>The many chaps that
we have left behind us</i>

627
00:42:40,121 --> 00:42:42,612
<i>There's one
especially I recall</i>

628
00:42:43,558 --> 00:42:46,755
<i>There's one I miss
the most of all</i>

629
00:42:47,161 --> 00:42:51,825
<i>We've placed them
on the wall Just to remind us</i>

630
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:55,397
<i>And I snapped
my favorite pin up</i>

631
00:42:56,104 --> 00:42:59,631
<i>As he waved goodbye
at the train</i>

632
00:43:00,341 --> 00:43:02,502
<i>He started to cry</i>

633
00:43:02,644 --> 00:43:05,204
<i>I yelled, "Chin up"</i>

634
00:43:06,014 --> 00:43:09,882
<i>One of us has to remain</i>

635
00:43:13,855 --> 00:43:17,882
<i>I'm a lonely girI
I readily admit it</i>

636
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:21,686
<i>I was merely patriotic
when I signed</i>

637
00:43:22,664 --> 00:43:26,065
<i>And I'm very frank
to say I did it</i>

638
00:43:26,401 --> 00:43:29,802
<i>For the boy I left behind</i>

639
00:43:30,938 --> 00:43:34,203
<i>Some men in uniform
have tried to sway me</i>

640
00:43:34,609 --> 00:43:38,272
<i>They all faiI because
he's always on my mind</i>

641
00:43:39,013 --> 00:43:42,380
<i>And I'm saving most of
what they pay me</i>

642
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:46,242
<i>For the boy I left behind</i>

643
00:43:46,888 --> 00:43:50,915
<i>Yes he was first
in line to enlist</i>

644
00:43:51,492 --> 00:43:54,427
<i>Shouting V for victory</i>

645
00:43:55,296 --> 00:43:59,392
<i>They looked but found
no pulse in his wrist</i>

646
00:43:59,834 --> 00:44:04,430
<i>So maybe that's why
they took me</i>

647
00:44:04,972 --> 00:44:08,601
<i>If they need me then
I'm glad to be of service</i>

648
00:44:08,976 --> 00:44:12,935
<i>But there's one thing
that I wish they had defined</i>

649
00:44:13,381 --> 00:44:17,215
<i>Oh, they should have
told me, I get nervous</i>

650
00:44:17,285 --> 00:44:21,517
<i>For the boy I left behind</i>

651
00:44:32,533 --> 00:44:35,661
<i>I get aches all over
and it's getting chronic</i>

652
00:44:36,537 --> 00:44:39,665
<i>I take medicines and pills of every kind</i>

653
00:44:40,742 --> 00:44:44,542
<i>But they'll never
substitute our tonic</i>

654
00:44:44,979 --> 00:44:48,039
<i>For the boy I left behind</i>

655
00:44:49,117 --> 00:44:51,847
<i>The other day I got
the sweetest letter</i>

656
00:44:52,653 --> 00:44:56,248
<i>All my love and kisses,
that's the way he signed</i>

657
00:44:56,991 --> 00:45:00,552
<i>So each night
I wear his favorite sweater</i>

658
00:45:00,762 --> 00:45:04,198
<i>For the boy I left behind</i>

659
00:45:04,799 --> 00:45:09,065
<i>He goes down to
the blood bank each day</i>

660
00:45:09,504 --> 00:45:12,371
<i>Shouting V for victory</i>

661
00:45:13,141 --> 00:45:17,544
<i>He takes more blood
than he gives away</i>

662
00:45:17,879 --> 00:45:22,282
<i>So maybe that's why
they took me</i>

663
00:45:23,184 --> 00:45:26,881
<i>I'm supposed to be content
and Just keep dreaming</i>

664
00:45:27,355 --> 00:45:30,950
<i>If they think that I'm
content they must be blind</i>

665
00:45:31,793 --> 00:45:36,059
<i>'Cause I go to sleep
and wake up screaming</i>

666
00:45:49,477 --> 00:45:56,144
<i>For in every dream
I've pined</i>

667
00:45:56,717 --> 00:46:01,416
<i>For the boy I...</i>

668
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:22,803
<i>We're the victims of
a thousand regulations</i>

669
00:46:23,611 --> 00:46:28,207
<i>That's a military strata
Just designed</i>

670
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:35,055
<i>They can't regulate
a girI's sensations</i>

671
00:46:35,423 --> 00:46:39,120
<i>There's no rule
that they can find</i>

672
00:46:39,994 --> 00:46:43,430
<i>For the boy I left behind</i>

673
00:47:01,415 --> 00:47:02,814
Hello.

674
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:06,215
I couldn't wait until
after the show to see you.

675
00:47:07,255 --> 00:47:09,416
You are going to
talk to me, aren't you?

676
00:47:09,857 --> 00:47:10,949
What about?

677
00:47:11,025 --> 00:47:12,492
Rosalind, please.

678
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,093
So I acted like an idiot.

679
00:47:14,161 --> 00:47:16,789
But you can't rule a man out
for trying, can you?

680
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:18,693
After all, even a dog
is entitled to one bite.

681
00:47:20,868 --> 00:47:22,563
Now, wait a minute.

682
00:47:22,637 --> 00:47:24,366
I don't mean that literally.
I Just mean that...

683
00:47:24,438 --> 00:47:26,099
I know exactly
what you mean.

684
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:30,510
"We're grown up, we're modern,
we know what it's all about.

685
00:47:30,711 --> 00:47:33,202
"And remember, darling,
there's a war on. "

686
00:47:33,848 --> 00:47:35,372
Routine number three.

687
00:47:35,449 --> 00:47:37,349
That isn't a routine,
it's true.

688
00:47:37,418 --> 00:47:39,010
There is a war on.

689
00:47:39,086 --> 00:47:40,849
And it gives us
so little time.

690
00:47:41,455 --> 00:47:43,116
Don't let's waste it,
Rosalind.

691
00:47:43,324 --> 00:47:44,484
Please don't
let's waste it.

692
00:47:44,558 --> 00:47:45,684
Aren't you convinced yet that I'm...

693
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,284
I'm convinced of this,

694
00:47:47,395 --> 00:47:50,193
I've had a very bad time
since you walked out on me.

695
00:47:50,264 --> 00:47:51,288
Too bad about you.

696
00:47:51,365 --> 00:47:53,560
I tried to phone you, I've
apologized a dozen times in letters.

697
00:47:53,634 --> 00:47:55,226
Which I never opened.

698
00:47:55,303 --> 00:47:57,737
Well, there you are.
Is that fair?

699
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:00,329
I've tried to tell you
how I feel, I...

700
00:48:00,608 --> 00:48:02,303
Rosalind,
you've got to listen.

701
00:48:02,376 --> 00:48:03,843
I might not have
another chance.

702
00:48:03,911 --> 00:48:05,208
Why not?

703
00:48:05,746 --> 00:48:07,304
If there is a tomorrow
it's so much velvet, Roz.

704
00:48:10,685 --> 00:48:12,209
Don't talk like that.

705
00:48:13,487 --> 00:48:15,011
Please like me.

706
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:17,917
At least like me.

707
00:48:22,697 --> 00:48:23,891
This is Miss Bruce, sir.

708
00:48:23,965 --> 00:48:25,193
How do you do?
How do you do?

709
00:48:25,266 --> 00:48:27,393
Sorry, Lundy, but there's
something big on tonight.

710
00:48:28,936 --> 00:48:29,994
For you?

711
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:31,299
Evidently.

712
00:48:37,845 --> 00:48:39,710
I'm sorry to have to
interrupt this excellent show,

713
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,509
but I have
an announcement to make.

714
00:48:41,682 --> 00:48:45,675
All crews of Squadrons 1082, 1083
and 1084 will assemble at once

715
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,747
in the lecture room
of this building.

716
00:48:47,822 --> 00:48:49,380
The rest of you,
as you were.

717
00:48:50,024 --> 00:48:52,254
Please carry on with
the show. Thank you.

718
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,987
Well, so long.

719
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:57,722
Paul!

720
00:49:02,937 --> 00:49:03,961
Come back safely.

721
00:49:05,606 --> 00:49:06,732
Do you want me to?

722
00:49:08,042 --> 00:49:09,031
I want you to.

723
00:49:12,313 --> 00:49:13,337
Come on, Paul.

724
00:49:14,315 --> 00:49:15,407
Okay.

725
00:49:17,151 --> 00:49:18,618
You'll let me know when...

726
00:49:18,686 --> 00:49:20,017
I'll telephone you tomorrow.

727
00:49:20,087 --> 00:49:22,351
In the meantime, say it over
to yourself 100 times,

728
00:49:22,423 --> 00:49:23,617
"Paul loves me. "

729
00:49:23,724 --> 00:49:25,385
And when I get back,
you'll be used to the idea.

730
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,252
I'm used to it right now.

731
00:49:30,631 --> 00:49:32,599
I catch on awful quick

732
00:49:32,967 --> 00:49:34,229
when I want to.

733
00:49:53,954 --> 00:49:55,546
All right,
stand at ease.

734
00:50:18,746 --> 00:50:20,771
You're from the Music Box,
aren't you?

735
00:50:21,515 --> 00:50:22,641
Yes.

736
00:50:23,317 --> 00:50:24,841
You'll be late.

737
00:50:31,792 --> 00:50:33,384
Morning, ladies.

738
00:50:37,031 --> 00:50:38,464
Well, that's the first time

739
00:50:38,532 --> 00:50:40,591
I ever saw our Mr. Tommy take a nip.

740
00:50:40,668 --> 00:50:43,330
It's the Blitz.
Everything's topsy-turvy.

741
00:50:43,437 --> 00:50:45,405
My old man
stopped drinking.

742
00:50:45,573 --> 00:50:47,302
The doctor calls it
shell-shock.

743
00:50:47,374 --> 00:50:48,636
Quaint, ain't it?

744
00:50:49,343 --> 00:50:51,243
Hi, Judy,
top of the morning.

745
00:50:51,512 --> 00:50:53,104
Hello, Tommy.

746
00:50:54,715 --> 00:50:57,081
Tommy creates the most
original new steps.

747
00:50:57,418 --> 00:50:59,545
ROSALIND: I'm sorry
to keep bothering you.

748
00:50:59,987 --> 00:51:02,922
Yes, I know you're not permitted
to give out any information but...

749
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:05,517
Well, last night,
Squadron Leader Lundy said...

750
00:51:06,594 --> 00:51:07,856
Well, he said he would
telephone me

751
00:51:07,928 --> 00:51:09,520
and I haven't heard from him.

752
00:51:10,698 --> 00:51:12,427
All I wanna know is,

753
00:51:12,967 --> 00:51:14,696
did he get back?

754
00:51:15,636 --> 00:51:17,934
Can't you tell me
that, please?

755
00:51:21,275 --> 00:51:23,800
And all the time I thought
Tommy was going for you.

756
00:51:24,845 --> 00:51:26,176
Oh, shut up.

757
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,210
I can't keep up with the
love life of this opera house.

758
00:51:32,153 --> 00:51:34,053
Now, when I want a man,
I go after him.

759
00:51:34,989 --> 00:51:36,581
Thanks for the trade secret.

760
00:51:36,657 --> 00:51:38,124
Judy, you're on!

761
00:51:38,192 --> 00:51:39,420
Coming, Sam.

762
00:51:42,029 --> 00:51:44,088
I'm betting on Paul, Roz.

763
00:51:44,532 --> 00:51:46,329
Do you think I'm not?

764
00:51:52,273 --> 00:51:53,968
On with you, Judy.

765
00:52:04,818 --> 00:52:06,479
<i>If you're all used to</i>

766

00:52:31,845 --> 00:52:33,039
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

772
00:52:42,957 --> 00:52:47,189
<i>Here's a news reeI made
strictly for smiles</i>

773
00:52:48,462 --> 00:52:53,229
<i>And dedicated
to the British Isles</i>

774
00:52:57,404 --> 00:52:59,702
<i>Hi there, mister</i>

775
00:53:00,007 --> 00:53:01,838
<i>Mean me, sister?</i>

776
00:53:02,209 --> 00:53:06,612
<i>Would you step down here
and also bring the gals?</i>

777
00:53:18,492 --> 00:53:21,655
<i>A word with you, there</i>

778
00:53:22,196 --> 00:53:26,257
<i>I'd like to talk
to you two, there</i>

779
00:53:26,367 --> 00:53:28,835
<i>Would you Join me, please?</i>

780
00:53:29,069 --> 00:53:33,301
<i>And bring along your pals</i>

781

<i>Say, men, you with the wren</i>

783
00:53:48,689 --> 00:53:52,147
<i>I'd like to have you
come down here</i>

784
00:53:52,293 --> 00:53:55,592
<i>For a little tte--tte</i>

785
00:54:04,104 --> 00:54:07,232
Pardon me, I think I see
a friend of mine in the ARP.

786
00:54:07,841 --> 00:54:09,741
Hi there, pal!
Is that you, Al?

787
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:11,710
Yes, come on down
and bring your gal.

788
00:54:22,022 --> 00:54:24,786
<i>Just a few more
one or two more</i>

789
00:54:24,858 --> 00:54:27,725
<i>And the row's complete</i>

790
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:31,587
<i>Here stands all...</i>

791
00:54:31,699 --> 00:54:33,667
<i>The guy in the scarf</i>

792
00:54:33,734 --> 00:54:35,702
<i>The boy on the phone</i>

793
00:54:35,769 --> 00:54:42,402
<i>And the man on the street</i>

794
00:54:43,744 --> 00:54:47,737
<i>We would like to ask you
why we're gathered here</i>

795
00:54:48,215 --> 00:54:51,184
<i>The reason
you've been invited</i>

796
00:54:51,285 --> 00:54:53,776
<i>Is to show the world</i>

797
00:54:53,854 --> 00:54:57,722
<i>That we're united</i>

798
00:54:58,125 --> 00:54:59,990
<i>If you've a faith like mine</i>

799
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:02,051
<i>The stars are about to shine</i>

800
00:55:02,129 --> 00:55:03,528
<i>The skies will all be bright</i>

801
00:55:03,597 --> 00:55:05,656
<i>Tonight and every night
Every night</i>

802
00:55:05,733 --> 00:55:07,598
<i>So keep your spirits high</i>

803
00:55:07,668 --> 00:55:09,602
<i>The clouds will all go by</i>

804
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:10,967
<i>We've got a goaI to sight</i>

805
00:55:11,038 --> 00:55:13,370
<i>Tonight and every night
Every night</i>

806
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,206
<i>Say, hi there, chum
why so glum?</i>

807
00:55:17,911 --> 00:55:20,846
<i>Things could be much worse Be worse</i>

808
00:55:20,948 --> 00:55:23,508
<i>And how about you lad</i>

809
00:55:23,584 --> 00:55:25,449
<i>Why so sad?</i>

810
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:28,579
<i>How could we go forward
when you're in reverse?</i>

811
00:55:28,655 --> 00:55:30,520
<i>If you agree with me</i>

812
00:55:30,591 --> 00:55:32,525
<i>Let's have some harmony</i>

813
00:55:32,593 --> 00:55:33,992
<i>Do-re-mi-fa-so-mi</i>

814
00:55:34,061 --> 00:55:35,995
<i>So, what if it's not right</i>

815
00:55:36,063 --> 00:55:38,190
<i>Whatever song is played</i>

816
00:55:38,265 --> 00:55:40,062
<i>Will help your worries fade</i>

817
00:55:40,134 --> 00:55:41,601
<i>And make your cares
take flight</i>

818
00:55:41,668 --> 00:55:43,932
<i>Tonight and every night</i>

819
00:55:44,071 --> 00:55:46,198
<i>We're gonna win</i>

820
00:55:46,407 --> 00:55:48,398
<i>Come on, grin</i>

821
00:55:48,475 --> 00:55:51,740
<i>Therein lies our might</i>

822
00:55:52,246 --> 00:55:55,647
<i>We'll go on
and on and on</i>

823
00:55:55,716 --> 00:55:58,378
<i>Tonight</i>

824
00:55:58,552 --> 00:56:03,216
<i>And every night Tonight,
tonight, and every night</i>

825
00:56:03,957 --> 00:56:07,256
<i>Tonight</i>

826
00:56:07,361 --> 00:56:09,522
<i>And every night</i>

827
00:56:09,596 --> 00:56:10,790
<i>The skies will all be bright</i>

828
00:56:10,864 --> 00:56:12,422
<i>Tonight and every night</i>

829
00:56:12,499 --> 00:56:15,195
<i>Be bright tonight</i>

830
00:56:17,204 --> 00:56:18,967
<i>And every night</i>

831
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:20,506
<i>You keep your
spirits high</i>

832
00:56:20,574 --> 00:56:22,701
<i>The clouds will
all go by</i>

833
00:56:22,976 --> 00:56:25,342
<i>We're gonna win</i>

834
00:56:25,512 --> 00:56:26,774
<i>Come on, grin</i>

835
00:56:26,847 --> 00:56:30,112
<i>Because therein
lies our might</i>

836
00:56:30,184 --> 00:56:31,674
<i>Our might</i>

837
00:56:31,752 --> 00:56:35,051
<i>We'll go on
and on and on</i>

838
00:56:35,522 --> 00:56:36,682
<i>Tonight</i>

839
00:56:36,757 --> 00:56:38,247
<i>We're going to fight
because we're right</i>

840
00:56:38,325 --> 00:56:41,055
<i>And every night</i>

841
00:56:41,128 --> 00:56:45,565
<i>Tonight, and every night
Tonight, and every night</i>

842
00:56:45,632 --> 00:56:48,931
<i>Tonight</i>

843
00:56:49,369 --> 00:56:54,466
<i>And every night</i>

844
00:56:58,846 --> 00:57:01,314
Hello? Yes, this is
the Music Box.

845
00:57:01,849 --> 00:57:03,146
Who?

846
00:57:03,217 --> 00:57:05,549
Oh, yes. Just a moment,
I'll get her.

847
00:57:06,353 --> 00:57:07,581
For you.

848
00:57:11,592 --> 00:57:12,752
Hello.

849
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:16,955
Paul!

850
00:57:18,065 --> 00:57:19,327
Oh, Paul!

851
00:57:20,467 --> 00:57:21,991
Are you all right?

852
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:24,059
I didn't know
what had happened.

853
00:57:24,137 --> 00:57:25,195
I thought you were...

854
00:57:25,272 --> 00:57:26,739
I was afraid that...

855
00:57:28,909 --> 00:57:31,139
Of course I've been saying it.

856
00:57:31,578 --> 00:57:33,239
Yes, it sounds wonderful.

857
00:57:33,881 --> 00:57:34,939
Where are you?

858
00:57:35,415 --> 00:57:37,076
I'm here, in London,

859
00:57:37,684 --> 00:57:39,345
on my way back to my unit.

860
00:57:39,987 --> 00:57:42,387
I ran into a little trouble,
force landed in Scotland.

861
00:57:42,856 --> 00:57:44,483
I'm going to
see you, aren't I?

862
00:57:44,625 --> 00:57:46,252
You're not going
back right away?

863
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,925
There's an eight o'clock train
tomorrow morning.

864
00:57:47,995 --> 00:57:49,053
I've got to be on it.

865
00:57:49,263 --> 00:57:51,561
That'll give us
10 whole hours, darling.

866
00:58:08,215 --> 00:58:09,546
Hello.

867
00:58:09,716 --> 00:58:11,047
Hello.

868
00:58:14,421 --> 00:58:17,254
Begging your pardon, sir, but we
are going somewhere, aren't we?

869
00:58:17,324 --> 00:58:19,815
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm sorry. We...

870
00:58:22,162 --> 00:58:23,424
Where to?

871
00:58:24,598 --> 00:58:27,158
We've never been by
ourselves in our whole life.

872
00:58:27,467 --> 00:58:29,059
Do you realize that?

873
00:58:29,703 --> 00:58:31,295
Do I realize it?

874
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:33,465
Well, once.

875
00:58:34,308 --> 00:58:36,538
Bu we don't
talk about that, do we?

876
00:58:36,777 --> 00:58:38,745
No, we don't
talk about that.

877
00:58:38,812 --> 00:58:40,040
Thanks.

878
00:58:40,547 --> 00:58:42,538
Besides, you're forgiven.

879
00:58:42,683 --> 00:58:45,345
How about me forgiving you
too, governor, and let's be off.

880
00:58:45,419 --> 00:58:48,149
Oh, yes, yes. Uh...

881
00:58:51,024 --> 00:58:52,924
There must be
somewhere we can go.

882
00:58:54,795 --> 00:58:55,887
There's only one place

883
00:58:55,963 --> 00:58:58,454
we could be by ourselves,
isn't there?

884
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:01,327
Can't we go there?

885
00:59:01,535 --> 00:59:02,797
My place?

886
00:59:03,203 --> 00:59:04,431
Why not?

887
00:59:05,405 --> 00:59:06,770
I love you.

888
00:59:13,313 --> 00:59:14,507
I love you.

889
00:59:14,581 --> 00:59:17,106
It's all so beautiful
it fair makes me heart bleed.

890
00:59:17,184 --> 00:59:18,583
Can't we
love and trust each other

891
00:59:18,652 --> 00:59:20,142
and still drive
around the park a bit?

892
00:59:21,521 --> 00:59:23,284
No, cabby, my place.

893
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,460
I don't want to
be nosy, governor,

894
00:59:28,528 --> 00:59:31,019
but it would be much easier
if I had your address.

895
00:59:31,098 --> 00:59:32,690
Now, wouldn't it?

896
00:59:33,133 --> 00:59:35,260
Oh, I'm sorry,
Temple Gardens.

897
00:59:35,736 --> 00:59:36,998
DRIVER: Thank you, sir.

898
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,206
Would you like to
take cover, sir?

899
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:51,508
No, thanks, we'll go on.

900
01:00:00,427 --> 01:00:02,952
ARMY OFFICER: Sorry, sir, would you
mind giving up this cab? It's urgent.

901
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:04,991
Certainly,
go right ahead.

902
01:00:14,341 --> 01:00:15,672
It's not very far
to my place.

903
01:00:15,742 --> 01:00:17,539
I don't suppose you can make
it though, in those high heels?

904
01:00:17,644 --> 01:00:19,475
I go everywhere
in high heels.

905
01:00:19,546 --> 01:00:20,877
Come on, let's go!

906
01:00:21,715 --> 01:00:23,683
What a climate! The one
night you'd beg for fog,

907
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,116
and look at that silly moon,
absolutely blazing away!

908
01:00:34,027 --> 01:00:35,824
Isn't that your flat?

909
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:38,657
That was my flat.

910
01:00:49,042 --> 01:00:50,771
Have you ever been asleep
with the girl you love

911
01:00:50,844 --> 01:00:52,709
on the embankment,
in the early morning?

912
01:00:52,846 --> 01:00:54,746
Quite frankly,
I haven't.

913
01:00:54,948 --> 01:00:56,711
Opens up a whole
new line of thought.

914
01:00:56,783 --> 01:00:58,512
I'm going to marry her,
you know.

915
01:00:58,585 --> 01:01:00,246
Does she know
anything about it?

916
01:01:00,554 --> 01:01:02,021
I suppose so.

917
01:01:02,689 --> 01:01:05,453
I haven't actually mentioned
it to her yet, but...

918
01:01:10,464 --> 01:01:12,455
Good heavens! You don't
suppose she wouldn't?

919
01:01:12,632 --> 01:01:14,429
Well, it's happened,
I imagine.

920
01:01:17,137 --> 01:01:18,195
Hey, what's your hurry?

921
01:01:18,271 --> 01:01:20,466
What's my hurry? I'm
going to telephone her.

922
01:01:20,907 --> 01:01:22,272
Oh, no you don't.

923
01:01:22,342 --> 01:01:23,969
The old man
wants to see you.

924
01:01:24,478 --> 01:01:25,706
Now!

925
01:01:26,413 --> 01:01:27,641
Now?
Now.

926
01:01:41,561 --> 01:01:43,085
Don't worry, Roz.

927
01:01:43,163 --> 01:01:46,155
If something had happened to
Paul, you'd have heard by now.

928
01:01:46,233 --> 01:01:47,962
Bad news travels...
Yes, I know.

929
01:01:48,101 --> 01:01:50,160
But it's been
nearly two weeks, Judy,

930
01:01:50,303 --> 01:01:52,635
and they're always back
in six or eight hours, if...

931
01:01:53,573 --> 01:01:55,302
If they're coming back.

932
01:01:57,077 --> 01:01:58,101
Judy, look!

933
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:01,740
It's Paul's observer.

934
01:02:01,815 --> 01:02:03,180
Yes. That means...

935
01:02:08,288 --> 01:02:09,414
Hello, Leslie.

936
01:02:09,489 --> 01:02:10,854
Oh, Miss Bruce,
Miss Kane.

937
01:02:10,924 --> 01:02:13,449
When did you get back?
Is Paul all right?

938
01:02:13,527 --> 01:02:15,825
I imagine
he's quite all right.

939
01:02:16,229 --> 01:02:18,060
We haven't
seen him, exactly.

940
01:02:18,131 --> 01:02:19,257
You haven't?

941
01:02:19,332 --> 01:02:21,823
No. You see, we've
been on 14-days leave.

942
01:02:21,902 --> 01:02:24,268
Yes, and as you can imagine, we've
been putting it to pretty good use.

943
01:02:24,337 --> 01:02:26,202
Yes. Well, have you all been on leave?

944
01:02:26,273 --> 01:02:27,399
Yes.
Yes.

945
01:02:27,674 --> 01:02:29,266
All the squadron,
in fact.

946
01:02:29,442 --> 01:02:31,672
We've sent
the second team in.

947
01:02:31,945 --> 01:02:35,381
Well, I think we've
got to be getting along.

948
01:02:35,448 --> 01:02:36,847
Yes, goodbye.
Goodbye.

949
01:02:36,917 --> 01:02:38,407
Goodbye, Miss Bruce.
Goodbye.

950
01:02:38,819 --> 01:02:40,878
Oh, and have
a nice time.

951
01:02:40,954 --> 01:02:42,683
Thank you. Goodbye.
Thank you.

952
01:02:48,695 --> 01:02:50,322
Now, wait a minute, Roz.

953
01:02:50,397 --> 01:02:53,264
Perhaps Paul had to help
the second team or something.

954
01:02:53,867 --> 01:02:55,164
You know better than that.

955
01:02:55,235 --> 01:02:57,169
If they're on leave,
he's on leave.

956
01:02:57,437 --> 01:02:59,337
You saw how they acted,
didn't you?

957
01:02:59,873 --> 01:03:02,068
Men are so
beautifully loyal.

958
01:03:02,609 --> 01:03:05,009
Oh, Miss Bruce.
Here's a message for you.

959
01:03:09,783 --> 01:03:11,011
Oh.

960
01:03:11,551 --> 01:03:12,711
"Oh," what?

961
01:03:12,786 --> 01:03:14,151
Read it.

962
01:03:15,088 --> 01:03:16,783
"Dear, Miss Bruce.
I'm Paul's father.

963
01:03:16,857 --> 01:03:19,655
"I'm in town and shall come
to see the performance tonight.

964
01:03:19,726 --> 01:03:21,523
"I would like very much to have
a few words with you afterwards

965
01:03:21,595 --> 01:03:22,584
"if it is convenient.

966
01:03:22,662 --> 01:03:24,721
"Yours faithfully,
Gerald Lundy. "

967
01:03:24,965 --> 01:03:26,227
What does he want?

968
01:03:26,299 --> 01:03:27,323
It's very simple, darling.

969
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,960
He wants to explain to me that
he's allergic to grocers' daughters

970
01:03:30,036 --> 01:03:31,526
who go on the stage.

971
01:03:32,205 --> 01:03:33,729
Well, I'll give him
that pleasure.

972
01:03:33,807 --> 01:03:36,571
I'll explain to him that I
have a few allergies myself.

973
01:03:36,643 --> 01:03:39,077
And one of them is
weak-kneed squadron leaders!

974
01:03:41,381 --> 01:03:43,178
Third row, center.

975
01:03:46,486 --> 01:03:48,420
It's too bad I have
this costume on.

976
01:03:48,755 --> 01:03:51,349
I'd like to have made his
visit really worthwhile.

977
01:04:14,948 --> 01:04:17,849
<i>Life's up and down</i>

978
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:22,247
<i>It's smile and frown</i>

979
01:04:23,089 --> 01:04:25,887
<i>It can either be a place</i>

980
01:04:25,959 --> 01:04:29,122
<i>To laugh or weep in</i>

981
01:04:31,097 --> 01:04:34,294
<i>The fact is you're the one</i>

982
01:04:34,367 --> 01:04:38,929
<i>Who makes
the bed you sleep in</i>

983
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:49,471
<i>Cry and you cry alone</i>

984
01:04:50,116 --> 01:04:52,983
<i>Your smile is gone</i>

985
01:04:53,053 --> 01:04:56,580
<i>And so you're on your own</i>

986
01:04:57,657 --> 01:05:03,618
<i>Remember the
weeping willow, my friend</i>

987
01:05:05,065 --> 01:05:08,000
<i>It's such a lonely tree</i>

988
01:05:08,068 --> 01:05:10,229
<i>Just look and see</i>

989
01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:13,567
<i>All the birds have flown</i>

990
01:05:13,707 --> 01:05:18,269
<i>Laugh, make it
long and loud</i>

991
01:05:18,945 --> 01:05:21,311
<i>That Joke you crack</i>

992
01:05:21,414 --> 01:05:24,383
<i>Will soon attract a crowd</i>

993
01:05:25,251 --> 01:05:29,312
<i>You'll find my logic
well founded</i>

994
01:05:29,556 --> 01:05:32,218
<i>Laugh, you're surrounded</i>

995
01:05:32,325 --> 01:05:36,694
<i>But cry
and you cry all alone</i>

996
01:05:41,701 --> 01:05:46,035
<i>Cry, and you cry alone</i>

997
01:05:47,807 --> 01:05:50,537
<i>Your smile is gone</i>

998
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:53,875
<i>And so you're on your own</i>

999
01:05:55,015 --> 01:06:00,578
<i>Remember the
weeping willow, my friend</i>

1000
01:06:01,988 --> 01:06:04,889
<i>It's such a lonely tree</i>

1001
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:07,119
<i>Just look and see</i>

1002
01:06:07,193 --> 01:06:10,162
<i>All the birds have flown</i>

1003
01:06:23,476 --> 01:06:26,240
<i>Laugh</i>

1004
01:06:28,915 --> 01:06:31,645
<i>Laugh</i>

1005
01:06:34,087 --> 01:06:35,554
<i>Laugh</i>

1006
01:06:35,622 --> 01:06:37,886
<i>Make it long and loud</i>

1007
01:06:38,591 --> 01:06:40,582
<i>That Joke you crack</i>

1008
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,924
<i>Will soon attract a crowd</i>

1009
01:06:43,863 --> 01:06:47,663
<i>You'll find my logic
well founded</i>

1010
01:06:47,734 --> 01:06:49,895
<i>Laugh, you're surrounded</i>

1011
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,154
Take care of that one, Fred.
You come with me.

1012
01:08:48,855 --> 01:08:50,652
Take it easy. There.

1013
01:08:50,823 --> 01:08:52,484
Have off with his cloak.

1014
01:08:55,595 --> 01:08:58,257
Sam, you'd better set
the Gypsy number.

1015
01:08:58,431 --> 01:09:00,365
It's no good. There's
no room for them to work.

1016
01:09:00,433 --> 01:09:02,663
The rigging's stuck.
I can't fly the drop.

1017
01:09:02,769 --> 01:09:04,669
We'll have to stop the
show for 15 minutes.

1018
01:09:04,938 --> 01:09:06,269
Very well.

1019
01:09:11,277 --> 01:09:12,972
Oh, Mrs. Tolliver!

1020
01:09:13,713 --> 01:09:16,011
You don't have to stop
the show. Let me go on.

1021
01:09:16,082 --> 01:09:17,106
What?

1022
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,309
Oh, let me do my act.

1023
01:09:18,384 --> 01:09:20,944
I have all me props here.
I've always had them here.

1024
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:22,009
Oh, Fred.

1025
01:09:22,088 --> 01:09:24,022
But, Mrs. Tolliver,
20 years ago...

1026
01:09:24,090 --> 01:09:26,752
I know.
You knocked them cold.

1027
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,227
What do you think, Sam?

1028
01:09:29,596 --> 01:09:31,621
Well, what have
we got to lose?

1029
01:09:31,998 --> 01:09:33,329
All right, Fred.

1030
01:09:33,633 --> 01:09:35,965
I'm on. I'm on!

1031
01:09:39,305 --> 01:09:40,567
Don't worry, miss.

1032
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,631
He was a bit of
all right in his day.

1033
01:09:42,709 --> 01:09:43,698
How do you know?

1034
01:09:43,776 --> 01:09:46,438
I cleaned the theater
where he worked 20 years ago.

1035
01:09:46,646 --> 01:09:48,580
Of course, it won't be
the same without Lucy.

1036
01:09:48,648 --> 01:09:49,706
Lucy?

1037
01:09:49,782 --> 01:09:51,340
Oh, she was
the other half of the act.

1038
01:09:51,417 --> 01:09:52,406
The better half.

1039
01:09:56,256 --> 01:09:57,314
Do you remember
what they did?

1040
01:09:57,390 --> 01:09:59,324
Oh, like it was yesterday.

1041
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:01,626
Come with me.

1042
01:10:05,898 --> 01:10:07,160
Will you tell Bert
to follow me,

1043
01:10:07,233 --> 01:10:08,530
<i>and we'll finish
with Anywhere.</i>

1044
01:10:13,906 --> 01:10:16,431
Bert, Fred's going on
to do his act.

1045
01:10:16,709 --> 01:10:19,007
<i>Now, follow him and
finish up with Anywhere.</i>

1046
01:10:19,879 --> 01:10:22,439
Now, how do you know
it's worse than the Blitz?

1047
01:10:39,766 --> 01:10:42,166
Well, who'd you expect,
Bing Crosby?

1048
01:10:42,969 --> 01:10:45,460
Are you ready, maestro?
Let's torture the customers.

1049
01:10:52,245 --> 01:10:53,769
Wait a minute. Wait.

1050
01:11:00,486 --> 01:11:02,784
Save the wood, boys,
it may be a cold winter.

1051
01:11:05,158 --> 01:11:07,319
<i>And now I'm going to play
Pop Goes the WeaseI</i>

1052
01:11:07,393 --> 01:11:09,258
for you with sound effect.

1053
01:11:09,329 --> 01:11:11,263
<i>Pop Goes the WeaseI
with sound effect.</i>

1054
01:11:15,335 --> 01:11:16,563
Wait a minute.

1055
01:11:19,605 --> 01:11:21,129
I'm gonna let you
pop the bag.

1056
01:11:21,207 --> 01:11:22,265
I'm gonna let you
pop the bag.

1057
01:11:22,342 --> 01:11:24,833
You take the bag. You
take the bag. Take the bag.

1058
01:11:25,178 --> 01:11:26,941
I'll play the music.

1059
01:11:27,313 --> 01:11:29,747
When I give you the cue,
you pop the bag.

1060
01:11:29,882 --> 01:11:31,281
Whoopee!
AUDIENCE: Whoopee!

1061
01:11:31,684 --> 01:11:33,345
Thank you, folks,
thank you.

1062
01:11:44,897 --> 01:11:46,421
He didn't do it.

1063
01:11:46,532 --> 01:11:47,624
Look, give me the bag.
Give me the bag.

1064
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,190
You don't get the idea.
Look here.

1065
01:11:49,268 --> 01:11:50,860
Give me the bag.

1066
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:53,165
How do you expect to pop
without blowing it up?

1067
01:11:56,209 --> 01:11:57,574
Now watch.
Okay.

1068
01:11:57,877 --> 01:11:59,469
Whoopee!
AUDIENCE: Whoopee!

1069
01:11:59,579 --> 01:12:01,206
Thank you, folks,
thank you.

1070
01:12:12,825 --> 01:12:14,690
What's the matter?
Are you too good to pop?

1071
01:12:17,363 --> 01:12:20,389
<i>Say, maybe you'd like to hear
Listen to the Mockingbird?</i>

1072
01:12:20,533 --> 01:12:21,761
AUDIENCE: No!

1073
01:12:21,834 --> 01:12:23,529
You're going to
get it anyhow.

1074
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:25,397
Oh, listen to the mockingbird.

1075
01:12:28,508 --> 01:12:30,169
Ah. Wait a minute.

1076
01:12:30,243 --> 01:12:31,870
I'm gonna give you
another chance.

1077
01:12:31,944 --> 01:12:34,071
Here. You take
the bird whistle there.

1078
01:12:34,147 --> 01:12:36,308
You take the bird whistle.
Take the bird whistle.

1079
01:12:36,416 --> 01:12:39,010
In this number, when I say,

1080
01:12:39,085 --> 01:12:40,450
"Oh, listen to
the mockingbird... "

1081
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,489
"Oh, listen to the mockingbird"
is the cue for the bird whistle.

1082
01:12:43,656 --> 01:12:44,782
Do you get it?
Yes.

1083
01:12:44,924 --> 01:12:46,357
Whoopee!
AUDIENCE: Whoopee!

1084
01:12:46,426 --> 01:12:48,360
Thank you, folks,
thank you.

1085
01:12:57,437 --> 01:12:59,701
I forgot to mention,
in this number,

1086
01:12:59,772 --> 01:13:03,902
I do a very clever imitation
of the mockingbird in flight.

1087
01:13:09,816 --> 01:13:11,010
Do you like it?

1088
01:13:12,118 --> 01:13:13,676
Here it is.

1089
01:13:15,855 --> 01:13:18,255
Well, what did you want
me to do? Break me leg?

1090
01:13:26,666 --> 01:13:28,293
<i>Oh, listen to
the mockingbird</i>

1091
01:13:28,367 --> 01:13:30,335
<i>Oh, listen to
the mockingbird</i>

1092
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:37,300
The guy's balmy.

1093
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:39,637
But I'm all right.

1094
01:13:39,712 --> 01:13:41,646
Look, the time to pop is over.

1095
01:13:43,783 --> 01:13:46,251
Now it's the bird effect.
The bird effect.

1096
01:13:54,627 --> 01:13:56,356
<i>Oh, listen to
the mockingbird</i>

1097
01:13:56,429 --> 01:13:57,760
<i>Oh, listen to the mocking</i>

1098
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:58,819
Give me the bird.

1099
01:14:04,036 --> 01:14:05,765
That is the last straw!
Take it easy.

1100
01:14:05,838 --> 01:14:07,738
Take it easy.
Take it easy now.

1101
01:14:07,807 --> 01:14:09,672
Oh, all right,
all right. Whoopee!

1102
01:14:09,742 --> 01:14:10,800
AUDIENCE: Whoopee!

1103
01:14:10,877 --> 01:14:12,469
Thank you, folks.
Thank you.

1104
01:14:13,346 --> 01:14:14,938
Boys, a chord in D.

1105
01:14:19,752 --> 01:14:21,117
And now I...

1106
01:14:22,955 --> 01:14:24,718
I've lost me dickey.

1107
01:14:32,999 --> 01:14:35,126
I have a very beautiful thing
and I'm gonna play for you.

1108
01:14:35,201 --> 01:14:38,295
<i>A number from our show
called Anywhere.</i>

1109
01:14:39,272 --> 01:14:41,331
When you hear me play this,

1110
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,601
you'll wish you were
anywhere but here.

1111
01:14:45,111 --> 01:14:47,579
Are you ready, professor?
Let's give them one.

1112
01:15:55,081 --> 01:15:57,413
You can believe it or not,
but one night,

1113
01:15:57,483 --> 01:15:59,883
I played 108 choruses of this.

1114
01:16:00,252 --> 01:16:01,583
Give them another one, boys.

1115
01:16:54,206 --> 01:16:55,230
Miss Bruce?

1116
01:16:55,307 --> 01:16:56,638
This way, sir.

1117
01:17:03,149 --> 01:17:04,309
Come in.

1118
01:17:07,119 --> 01:17:09,679
How do you do?
I'm Paul's father.

1119
01:17:10,089 --> 01:17:12,250
I know. This is
my friend, Miss Kane.

1120
01:17:12,491 --> 01:17:14,823
Her best friend.
And I'm staying.

1121
01:17:16,128 --> 01:17:19,291
Oh, I'm sure if Miss Bruce
doesn't obJect, I don't.

1122
01:17:21,333 --> 01:17:23,995
I'm very much afraid I've
taken on a difficult task.

1123
01:17:24,537 --> 01:17:27,062
You'll be surprised
how easy it's going to be.

1124
01:17:27,139 --> 01:17:28,902
Sit down, Mr. Lundy.

1125
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:32,304
Judy.

1126
01:17:37,883 --> 01:17:40,545
Have you heard from my son
in the last two weeks?

1127
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:44,184
Well, I haven't kept track
of the time exactly. I...

1128
01:17:46,192 --> 01:17:47,591
You know I haven't,
Mr. Lundy.

1129
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:49,059
Neither have I.

1130
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,753
You haven't?

1131
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:52,798
But he's here in London,
isn't he? His friends were...

1132
01:17:52,865 --> 01:17:53,889
Oh, no.

1133
01:17:53,966 --> 01:17:56,457
No. He was detailed for a
special mission of some sort.

1134
01:17:56,535 --> 01:17:57,866
That much I did learn.

1135
01:17:57,937 --> 01:17:59,700
Something quite important,
I believe.

1136
01:17:59,772 --> 01:18:02,434
Important enough to take him
away from his own squadron.

1137
01:18:03,609 --> 01:18:05,509
I received a trunk
with books

1138
01:18:05,578 --> 01:18:07,068
and personal belongings
yesterday.

1139
01:18:07,146 --> 01:18:08,579
You mean something's
happened?

1140
01:18:09,615 --> 01:18:11,173
Oh, no. No.

1141
01:18:11,417 --> 01:18:12,975
I believe that
during his absence,

1142
01:18:13,052 --> 01:18:15,145
his squadron is being moved
to another station, that's all.

1143
01:18:17,323 --> 01:18:18,483
Oh!

1144
01:18:20,359 --> 01:18:21,519
Uh, yes.

1145
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:26,528
Among the things
he sent home

1146
01:18:26,832 --> 01:18:28,356
was this Bible.

1147
01:18:29,034 --> 01:18:31,264
The one I gave him
when he enlisted.

1148
01:18:32,404 --> 01:18:34,838
This is precisely
the way it came.

1149
01:18:35,074 --> 01:18:36,735
Your photograph,

1150
01:18:37,176 --> 01:18:39,337
with a page of
the theater program.

1151
01:18:39,645 --> 01:18:42,011
See where he's written?
"This is for her. "

1152
01:18:42,081 --> 01:18:44,811
What's he trying to suggest?
Rosalind needs a Bible?

1153
01:18:45,518 --> 01:18:46,815
Quiet, Judy.

1154
01:18:47,086 --> 01:18:48,644
I didn't disturb a thing.

1155
01:18:48,854 --> 01:18:50,378
Here is where
your picture was,

1156
01:18:50,456 --> 01:18:51,616
in First Corinthians.

1157
01:18:52,858 --> 01:18:54,826
First Corinthian is
one of Paul's epistles.

1158
01:18:54,927 --> 01:18:56,189
The Saint Paul.

1159
01:18:56,295 --> 01:18:58,422
My Paul was named after him.

1160
01:18:58,798 --> 01:18:59,958
Hopefully.

1161
01:19:01,167 --> 01:19:04,000
Do you think he's trying
to tell me something or...

1162
01:19:04,436 --> 01:19:05,869
She means maybe it's a,

1163
01:19:05,938 --> 01:19:07,633
you know, a code
or something.

1164
01:19:07,706 --> 01:19:09,606
Maybe. Let's see now.

1165
01:19:10,609 --> 01:19:12,372
"In concerning
the things whereof,

1166
01:19:12,611 --> 01:19:14,374
"defraud ye not
one the other,

1167
01:19:14,513 --> 01:19:16,811
"for I would that all men
were even as I was.

1168
01:19:17,449 --> 01:19:19,349
"Therefore I say,
tis better to marry... "

1169
01:19:19,418 --> 01:19:20,783
What was that last one?

1170
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:22,109
"Tis better to marry... "

1171
01:19:22,188 --> 01:19:23,587
Mr. Lundy, look!

1172
01:19:24,356 --> 01:19:26,324
The words "This is for her"

1173
01:19:26,392 --> 01:19:28,986
come right opposite
"Tis better to marry. "

1174
01:19:30,963 --> 01:19:32,260
Do you suppose that...

1175
01:19:32,331 --> 01:19:33,992
That's the way
I translated it.

1176
01:19:35,234 --> 01:19:37,168
Well, I'll be...

1177
01:19:43,809 --> 01:19:46,801
I admit it is an extraordinary
way to propose to a girl.

1178
01:19:47,813 --> 01:19:49,075
What do you think?

1179
01:19:52,618 --> 01:19:54,085
What do you think?

1180
01:19:54,587 --> 01:19:56,612
I hope you're
going to accept.

1181
01:19:58,390 --> 01:19:59,652
Oh, dear.

1182
01:20:00,059 --> 01:20:01,287
The last time I proposed

1183
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:02,827
was 27 years ago.

1184
01:20:03,262 --> 01:20:04,991
I seem to have
lost my technique.

1185
01:20:06,198 --> 01:20:07,859
Will you marry us, Rosalind?

1186
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,027
Of course, I will.

1187
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:17,070
Tolly, Angela,
Toni, Joan, Tommy!

1188
01:20:17,877 --> 01:20:20,072
Apparently your betrothal
is being announced.

1189
01:20:21,714 --> 01:20:23,739
It has every sanction
I know.

1190
01:20:29,121 --> 01:20:30,486
Goodbye, my dear.

1191
01:20:31,323 --> 01:20:32,449
Goodbye.

1192
01:20:32,524 --> 01:20:33,923
What I've learned about
the theater tonight

1193
01:20:33,993 --> 01:20:35,961
has made me very humble

1194
01:20:36,028 --> 01:20:37,256
and very proud.

1195
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:40,196
It's nice to know that
my daughter is a soldier,

1196
01:20:40,266 --> 01:20:41,733
as well as my son.

1197
01:20:53,178 --> 01:20:55,237
Tommy, Tommy!
Have you heard...

1198
01:20:56,415 --> 01:20:58,280
Why, what's
the matter, Tommy?

1199
01:20:58,350 --> 01:20:59,442
Nothing.

1200
01:20:59,551 --> 01:21:01,849
I'm wondering what's gonna
happen to the deal we all made

1201
01:21:01,921 --> 01:21:04,151
to stick to the Music Box
for the duration.

1202
01:21:04,223 --> 01:21:06,214
But I'm not going to
leave the Music Box.

1203
01:21:06,292 --> 01:21:08,192
Paul's got his Job
and I've got mine.

1204
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:10,490
Don't make me laugh.

1205
01:21:10,996 --> 01:21:12,964
All Mr. Paul has to do
is raise his finger

1206
01:21:13,032 --> 01:21:15,125
and you'll come running,
wherever he is.

1207
01:21:16,035 --> 01:21:17,263
Tommy!

1208
01:21:18,671 --> 01:21:20,036
You're kidding, aren't you?

1209
01:21:20,105 --> 01:21:21,970
The only person I've
been kidding is myself.

1210
01:21:22,041 --> 01:21:23,474
I had a lot of
funny ideas about you,

1211
01:21:23,542 --> 01:21:25,134
only they're
not so funny now.

1212
01:21:25,477 --> 01:21:28,037
I never got around
to telling you, Roz, but,

1213
01:21:28,113 --> 01:21:29,580
I'm in love with you.

1214
01:21:29,748 --> 01:21:31,375
Or thought I was,
or used to be...

1215
01:21:31,517 --> 01:21:33,417
I don't know,
you sort it out.

1216
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:56,164
Paul's back, isn't he?

1217
01:21:56,241 --> 01:21:57,708
No, Roz,
it's his group captain.

1218
01:21:57,776 --> 01:21:59,471
He's waiting
in your dressing room.

1219
01:21:59,578 --> 01:22:00,704
Oh, Sam!

1220
01:22:00,946 --> 01:22:02,846
Now, now, take it easy.

1221
01:22:06,852 --> 01:22:09,286
Is he... Did anything...
Good morning, Miss Bruce.

1222
01:22:09,455 --> 01:22:10,786
I'm sorry.

1223
01:22:12,191 --> 01:22:13,215
You can tell me.

1224
01:22:13,292 --> 01:22:15,351
I only wanted to tell you that
Paul's back in the country

1225
01:22:15,427 --> 01:22:17,395
and he'll be here
tomorrow, Miss Bruce.

1226
01:22:17,997 --> 01:22:18,986
Oh!

1227
01:22:19,098 --> 01:22:21,362
And to explain that he's
been on a secret mission.

1228
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:23,895
You read about
the conference overseas?

1229
01:22:24,203 --> 01:22:26,262
Now, when a personage like
that has to be flown somewhere,

1230
01:22:26,338 --> 01:22:28,329
we choose a pretty
good pilot to fly him.

1231
01:22:29,141 --> 01:22:31,609
And your Paul's a pretty
good pilot, Miss Bruce.

1232
01:22:32,211 --> 01:22:33,872
You must think
I'm awfully silly,

1233
01:22:33,946 --> 01:22:35,880
but I saw the car outside,
and I...

1234
01:22:35,981 --> 01:22:37,448
I had to be in London
for the day,

1235
01:22:37,516 --> 01:22:39,677
so I thought I'd save you
24 hours of worry.

1236
01:22:40,986 --> 01:22:42,385
Thank you.

1237
01:22:43,889 --> 01:22:45,584
Thank you ever so much.

1238
01:22:49,328 --> 01:22:51,262
Roz, Roz.

1239
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:52,854
I'm all right.

1240
01:22:53,365 --> 01:22:55,560
I'm not crying, I'm laughing.

1241
01:22:57,202 --> 01:22:58,464
Oh, Judy.

1242
01:22:58,637 --> 01:23:00,036
Paul's coming back.

1243
01:23:00,372 --> 01:23:01,430
Oh!

1244
01:23:06,612 --> 01:23:09,012
<i>Anywhere</i>

1245
01:23:09,681 --> 01:23:13,708
<i>As long as you are there</i>

1246
01:23:15,387 --> 01:23:17,548
<i>Anywhere</i>

1247
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:22,456
<i>Just start the chase</i>

1248
01:23:24,163 --> 01:23:27,189
<i>I'll go where you are, dear</i>

1249
01:23:27,633 --> 01:23:30,898
<i>It doesn't matter
how far, dear</i>

1250
01:23:30,969 --> 01:23:33,062
<i>I'd take a trip</i>

1251
01:23:33,372 --> 01:23:35,806
<i>To a star, dear</i>

1252
01:23:35,941 --> 01:23:39,308
<i>For that warm embrace</i>

1253
01:23:39,378 --> 01:23:42,745
<i>Just say you care</i>

1254
01:23:43,749 --> 01:23:47,651
<i>And I'll go anywhere</i>

1255
01:23:50,489 --> 01:23:53,014
<i>Anytime</i>

1256
01:23:53,092 --> 01:23:55,959
<i>And anyplace</i>

1257
01:23:57,996 --> 01:24:02,490
<i>Oh, boy, I have
no magic carpet</i>

1258
01:24:02,868 --> 01:24:05,735
<i>I'm willing to swear</i>

1259
01:24:06,138 --> 01:24:09,335
<i>That kiss of yours</i>

1260
01:24:10,342 --> 01:24:15,473
<i>Could take me anywhere</i>

1261
01:24:17,583 --> 01:24:19,278
Roz, the Air Ministry
have agreed.

1262
01:24:19,351 --> 01:24:20,511
Hello.

1263
01:24:20,586 --> 01:24:22,713
Hello, Tommy. How are
you? So you're back, eh?

1264
01:24:22,788 --> 01:24:24,483
A fine welcome too.
That's a nice...

1265
01:24:24,556 --> 01:24:26,581
What would you do with a
girl who turns you down?

1266
01:24:26,658 --> 01:24:27,750
Turns you down?

1267
01:24:27,826 --> 01:24:29,521
Yes, here I am with
something I never counted on.

1268
01:24:29,595 --> 01:24:31,529
A real honeymoon.
A long one in Canada.

1269
01:24:31,597 --> 01:24:32,689
I'm being sent there.

1270
01:24:32,764 --> 01:24:34,732
And she tells me she's going
to stay here in the theater.

1271
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,700
But Paul, don't you...
Oh, no, she's not.

1272
01:24:37,336 --> 01:24:38,826
She's going to Canada.

1273
01:24:38,904 --> 01:24:41,270
There you are. Tommy knows
what he's talking about.

1274
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:43,631
Not always, but I do now.

1275
01:24:43,976 --> 01:24:46,103
Good luck, Roz,
and lots of happiness.

1276
01:24:46,178 --> 01:24:48,009
Everybody on stage
for the finale.

1277
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,547
Places quickly.

1278
01:24:53,685 --> 01:24:57,143
And if you're still in town when that
ship sails for Canada, I'll fire you.

1279
01:24:58,524 --> 01:25:00,253
Good luck, Roz.
Good luck.

1280
01:25:04,530 --> 01:25:06,088
Have you seen Tommy, Fred?

1281
01:25:06,165 --> 01:25:07,291
Tommy?

1282
01:25:07,366 --> 01:25:10,199
Well, now, come to
think of it, yes. Where?

1283
01:25:10,269 --> 01:25:12,464
Heading across the street
to the pub, Judy.

1284
01:25:12,538 --> 01:25:13,732
Thanks.

1285
01:25:17,609 --> 01:25:18,735
Hello, Judy.

1286
01:25:18,810 --> 01:25:20,141
Hello, Tommy.

1287
01:25:20,312 --> 01:25:23,179
Thought I'd have a little
celebration on my own. Join me?

1288
01:25:23,549 --> 01:25:25,540
Thanks. Sherry, please.

1289
01:25:28,153 --> 01:25:29,882
Have you got something
to celebrate, Tommy?

1290
01:25:29,955 --> 01:25:31,422
Certainly.

1291
01:25:31,490 --> 01:25:35,551
When an old pal gets married it calls for
a private toast from her two best friends.

1292
01:25:35,727 --> 01:25:36,921
To Roz.

1293
01:25:37,262 --> 01:25:38,388
To Roz.

1294
01:25:46,738 --> 01:25:50,504
It's going to be sort of empty
without her, isn't it, Tommy?

1295
01:25:50,776 --> 01:25:52,403
Oh, yes. Yes. Sure.

1296
01:25:52,945 --> 01:25:54,572
Especially to us.

1297
01:25:54,846 --> 01:25:57,337
We started something,
the three of us.

1298
01:26:00,085 --> 01:26:01,313
And now?

1299
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:05,447
Well, take one away from three
and you've got two.

1300
01:26:06,892 --> 01:26:09,292
A nice comfortable
figure, two.

1301
01:26:12,464 --> 01:26:14,432
A very nice figure, two.

1302
01:26:16,602 --> 01:26:19,036
You were very sweet
to Roz, Tommy.

1303
01:26:19,204 --> 01:26:20,694
I could kiss you for it.

1304
01:26:20,772 --> 01:26:22,763
Well, who's stopping you?

1305
01:26:47,299 --> 01:26:48,766
That was a close one.

1306
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,663
I hope everyone's all right.
What happened?

1307
01:26:51,003 --> 01:26:52,197
Any damage, Sam?

1308
01:26:52,271 --> 01:26:53,829
Pretty near.

1309
01:26:53,939 --> 01:26:55,429
Has anyone seen Tommy?

1310
01:26:55,507 --> 01:26:57,998
He should be on the roof
on fire watch. He's not there.

1311
01:26:58,443 --> 01:26:59,967
He must be
in his dressing room.

1312
01:27:00,045 --> 01:27:01,239
Roz!

1313
01:27:02,914 --> 01:27:04,939
Well, he must be someplace
in the theater.

1314
01:27:05,384 --> 01:27:06,749
If he is,
we can't find him.

1315
01:27:06,818 --> 01:27:08,809
The pub!
They got the pub!

1316
01:27:19,398 --> 01:27:21,229
Stand back there.
Keep under cover.

1317
01:27:39,451 --> 01:27:40,713
Tommy wasn't at the party.

1318
01:27:40,786 --> 01:27:42,845
No, he wasn't.
I didn't see him.

1319
01:27:42,921 --> 01:27:44,081
Judy!

1320
01:27:44,856 --> 01:27:46,289
Where's Judy?

1321
01:27:53,231 --> 01:27:54,858
Dear God, please!

1322
01:27:56,301 --> 01:27:58,735
Not Judy, not Tommy.

1323
01:28:02,074 --> 01:28:04,508
Oh, Paul, I can't stand
it. I've got to go.

1324
01:28:04,609 --> 01:28:06,270
Rosalind, you mustn't.

1325
01:28:25,997 --> 01:28:27,225
Judy?

1326
01:28:28,567 --> 01:28:29,898
And Tommy.

1327
01:28:51,757 --> 01:28:53,782
Overture and beginners.

1328
01:28:54,426 --> 01:28:57,259
Better call it off, Sam.
We can't go on.

1329
01:28:58,130 --> 01:29:00,496
We can't do that,
Mrs. Tolliver.

1330
01:29:00,932 --> 01:29:02,797
That's the way it is.

1331
01:29:02,868 --> 01:29:05,200
One falls out,
another steps in.

1332
01:29:05,570 --> 01:29:07,333
Soldier or civilian.

1333
01:29:15,614 --> 01:29:17,138
Very well, Sam.

1334
01:29:18,717 --> 01:29:21,379
We'll have to make some
changes in the running order.

1335
01:29:22,621 --> 01:29:24,088
Let me see.

1336
01:29:26,958 --> 01:29:29,552
Switch the gold number
next to the opening, and,

1337
01:29:30,762 --> 01:29:33,128
<i>we'll have to cut
Tonight and Every Night.</i>

1338
01:29:33,632 --> 01:29:34,860
Tolly.

1339
01:29:35,667 --> 01:29:38,067
Don't cut Judy's number.
I'll do it.

1340
01:29:40,172 --> 01:29:41,503
Okay, Roz.

1341
01:29:42,441 --> 01:29:44,875
We'll have it
next to the closing.

1342
01:29:45,644 --> 01:29:47,578
Children,
the curtain's going up.

1343
01:29:48,447 --> 01:29:50,574
Make it
a great performance.

1344
01:29:53,652 --> 01:29:54,778
Oh, Paul!

1345
01:29:54,853 --> 01:29:57,083
You don't have
to tell me. I know.

1346
01:29:57,589 --> 01:29:59,113
You're staying.

1347
01:30:01,026 --> 01:30:02,186
You...

1348
01:30:02,727 --> 01:30:04,092
You understand?

1349
01:30:04,162 --> 01:30:05,527
I understand.

1350
01:30:06,898 --> 01:30:08,365
And what we need

1351
01:30:08,433 --> 01:30:10,298
is a few more guys
from St. Louis.

1352
01:30:11,203 --> 01:30:12,397
Oh, darling.

1353
01:30:13,338 --> 01:30:15,397
<i>If you've a faith like mine</i>

1354
01:30:15,474 --> 01:30:17,738
<i>The stars are about to shine</i>

1355
01:30:17,809 --> 01:30:19,436
<i>The skies will all be bright</i>

1356
01:30:19,511 --> 01:30:22,275
<i>Tonight and every night
Every night</i>

1357
01:30:22,347 --> 01:30:24,372
<i>So keep your spirits high</i>

1358
01:30:24,449 --> 01:30:26,679
<i>The clouds will all go by</i>

1359
01:30:26,751 --> 01:30:28,480
<i>We've got a goaI to sight</i>

1360
01:30:28,553 --> 01:30:31,283
<i>Tonight and every night
Every night</i>

1361
01:30:31,356 --> 01:30:35,759
<i>Say hi there, chum
why so glum?</i>

1362
01:30:36,094 --> 01:30:38,688
<i>Things could be much worse</i>

1363
01:30:38,763 --> 01:30:39,855
<i>Be worse</i>

1364
01:30:39,931 --> 01:30:42,331
<i>And how about you lad</i>

1365
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,425
<i>Why so sad?</i>

1366
01:30:44,503 --> 01:30:46,562
<i>Tell me how could
we go forward</i>

1367
01:30:46,638 --> 01:30:48,572
<i>When you're in reverse?</i>

1368
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:50,767
<i>If you agree with me</i>

1369
01:30:50,842 --> 01:30:52,833
<i>Let's have some harmony</i>

1370
01:30:52,911 --> 01:30:54,572
<i>Do-re-mi-fa-so-mi</i>

1371
01:30:54,646 --> 01:30:57,274
<i>So what if it's not right?
So, what?</i>

1372
01:30:57,349 --> 01:30:59,476
<i>Whatever song is played</i>

1373
01:30:59,551 --> 01:31:01,644
<i>Will help your worries fade</i>

1374
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:03,312
<i>And make your cares
take flight</i>

1375
01:31:03,388 --> 01:31:05,015
<i>Tonight and every night</i>

1376
01:31:05,090 --> 01:31:06,182
<i>Every night</i>

1377
01:31:06,258 --> 01:31:08,419
<i>We're gonna win</i>

1378
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:10,760
<i>Come on, win</i>

1379
01:31:10,996 --> 01:31:13,658
<i>Therein lies our might</i>

1380
01:31:13,732 --> 01:31:15,199
<i>Our might</i>

1381
01:31:15,267 --> 01:31:19,101
<i>We'll go on
