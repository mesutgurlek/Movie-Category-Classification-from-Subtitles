1 
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:20,969 
APRIL TO PARIS 

2 
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,541 
DEPARTMENT OF STATE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 

3 
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,642 
- Hello, Mr Putnam. 
- Hello. 

4 
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:56,159 
- Hello, Mr Putnam. 
- You were not careful. 

5 
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,728 
Hi, Tracy. 

6 
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:01,370 
- Everything is squared? 
- Affirmative. 

7 
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,664 
Very good. 

8 
00:02:05,608 --> 00:02:07,974 
S. WINTHROP PUTNAM 
ASSISTANT TO THE ASSISTANT 

9 
00:02:08,144 --> 00:02:09,771 
DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE 

10 
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,288 
The letter, sir. 

11 
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,361 
In fact, the French still insists 
to see you. 

12 
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,296 
- It is not immigration? 
- It was sent to Justice 

13 
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:33,901 
who sent the Treasury, 
who has returned here. 

14 
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,470 
The usual channels. 
What is his complaint? 

15 
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,732 
This is the third time he comes here. 

16 
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:42,776 
I'm really busy with the festival, 
but let him come. 

17 
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:44,846 
You made me look? 

18 
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,408 
Find a place. 

19 
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,982 
If you get there. 

20 
00:02:53,022 --> 00:02:55,286 
Fouquet, my secretary has already said 

21 
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,857 
nothing could. 

22 
00:02:57,026 --> 00:03:01,360 
- I must be in Paris next week. 
- Your passport is in order. 

23 
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:04,466 
- You can go whenever you want. 
- When I want. 

24 
00:03:04,634 --> 00:03:09,003 
But I have no money for my ticket. 
And I can not fly by myself. 

25 
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,935 
I spent all winter 
to earn dollars Yankee 

26 
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,771 
but I do not 
Yankee every penny. 

27 
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,641 
The Treasury had to lock all your money 

28 
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:21,283 
to count how much tax you owe. 

29 
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:25,210 
- How long? 
- One week, two weeks. One month. 

30 
00:03:25,388 --> 00:03:26,480 
A month? 

31 
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:30,490 
No money, no wine, no women? 

32 
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:35,486 
Is this a way for man to live 
unless you are American? 

33 
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:39,324 
Sorry, but what are the rules. 
I can not do anything. 

34 

In France, I am a famous artist. 

35 
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:45,432 
I have my own cabaret. 

36 
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:48,975 
At the bank, I francs 
not knowing what to do. 

37 
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:51,278 
I'll call Paris 

38 
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:53,915 
and ask them to send me money. 
I can? 

39 
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,983 
- Yes. 
- Okay. 

40 
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,848 
But we must grasp 
as soon as it arrives. 

41 
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:02,316 
Charming. 

42 
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,055 
It will soon 
spring in Paris. 

43 
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:08,720 
Children dancing 
the Bois de Boulogne. 

44 
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:13,062 
Men will be selling hot chestnuts 
in small trucks in the street. 

45 
00:04:13,236 --> 00:04:14,260 
Chestnuts. 

46 
00:04:14,437 --> 00:04:19,067 
And everywhere, young couples 
will be entwined, kissing. 

47 
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:23,736 
Have pity for a man who is not breathing, 
only lives and loves when he is in Paris. 

48 
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,277 
You lend me enough to leave? 

49 
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:29,244 
It is against the rules. 

50 
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,881 
- In second class? 
- Impossible. 

51 
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:34,922 
- In steerage? 
- It is also against the rules. 

52 
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:38,185 
Coat me fat 
I'm going to swim across. 

53 
00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:39,554 
- It's ... 
- I know. 

54 
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:42,095 
It is also against the rules. 

55 
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:45,894 
I will wait to see a wizard 
above you. 

56 
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:01,141 
Ladies and gentlemen, this is not 
to criticize your government, 

57 
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:04,115 
but there are only regulations. 

58 
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:08,917 
Forms, red tape, efficiency, 
no room for error. 

59 
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:11,720 
What would happen to this giant machine 

60 
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:15,887 
if only one small human error 
it slipped? 

61 
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,795 
Things would not be as square, 
believe me. 

62 
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:21,835 
This mechanism would make the delicate balance ... 

63 
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,472 
There is something terrible happened. 

64 
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:31,374 
- What's going on? 
- I'm off to New York. 

65 
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:34,448 
Tell the Harvard Club 
I miss dinner. 

66 
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:36,482 
Tell them anything. 

67 
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,248 
Invent. 

68 
00:05:43,726 --> 00:05:45,591 
- I know what's wrong. 
- What? 

69 
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,730 
He mixed the letters 
Festival in Paris 

70 
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:50,559 
and sent the invitation Ethel Barrymore 
a dancer. 

71 
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:51,995 
A dancer? 

72 
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:54,466 
I'd better make his cartoons. 

73 
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,846 
One minute, Mr. Putnam. 

74 
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:11,350 
Why this whirlwind trip 
from Washington? 

75 
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:13,113 
The Festival of Paris is canceled? 

76 
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:17,089 
Any statement will come from the wizard. 
I am his assistant. 

77 
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,592 
But the Festival of Arts is you. 

78 
00:06:19,762 --> 00:06:22,287 
It seems that you take 
a representative of the theater. 

79 
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,491 
That it will be, 
Ethel Barrymore or Bugs Bunny? 

80 
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:27,033 
Very funny. 

81 
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:29,194 
Representatives of various arts 

82 
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:31,806 
come the best of the United States. 

83 
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,307 
Sorry to disappoint you, 
but everything is going very well. 

84 
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,345 
Why have caught 
the first cap and took a plane? 

85 
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:42,075 
I caught nothing at all, 
as you so vulgarly. 

86 
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:47,086 
This is a scheduled visit there for weeks. 
I wish you a good day. 

87 
00:06:51,527 --> 00:06:54,223 
- A further statement. 
- Mr. Putman. 

88 
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,622 
Knickerbocker theater. 
Make sure nobody is following us. 

89 
00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:01,927 
Okay, Dick Tracy, 
this will be our little secret. 

90 
00:07:11,914 --> 00:07:16,374 
Knickerbocker THEATRE PRESENTS 
THE GREAT MUSICAL SUCCESS: 

91 
00:07:16,552 --> 00:07:18,747 
"IT MUST BE OWL" 

92 
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,551 
It will $ 5. 

93 
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:30,858 
Hold. 

94 
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,558 
Say, and the tip? 

95 
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:36,000 
Your rates are set by the Commission. 

96 
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:38,072 
They will provide a living wage. 

97 
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:40,709 
You want to marry me for my money? 

98 
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,608 
Gratuities are unworthy 
and anti-American. They should be abolished. 

99 
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,806 
I'll give you some advice. 

100 
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:49,645 
Do not cross the street. 

101 
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:52,151 
It is a big organization. 

102 
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:07,992 
Close the door. 

103 
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:13,308 
- Where is your heel? 
- My what? 

104 
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:15,910 
You have a ticket 
or is it to get warm? 

105 
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,443 
I have no ticket. 

106 
00:08:17,613 --> 00:08:20,548 
I'm traveling on official 
for the government. 

107 
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:22,115 
I'd like to see ... 

108 
00:08:23,953 --> 00:08:25,750 
Miss Ethel S. Jackson. 

109 
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,390 
- Where can I find it? 
- Dynamite Jackson? 

110 
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:29,957 
Come here. 

111 
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:38,998 
It must be nice   
 Love every street corner  

112 
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:41,102 
This is the third from the left. 

113 
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,104 
 twinge  
It must be nice   

114 
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,639 
A beautiful plant, right? 

115 
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:51,303 
It must be nice   
 One way to heaven  

116 
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,347 
 It makes us peasants  
 A society full of people  

117 
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:57,384 
 That must be really cool  

118 
00:08:57,553 --> 00:09:00,283 
 It says  
 not rewrite history  

119 
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,923 
Since we are bewitched   

120 
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:03,615 
 We can not fight  

121 
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:07,126 
 Whoever said  
 That man was not made of wood  

122 
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:09,325 
 understand  

123 
00:09:09,498 --> 00:09:12,262 
It must be nice   
 Yes, really cool  

124 
00:09:12,435 --> 00:09:15,063 
 The only remedy to celibacy chronic  

125 
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,505 
 Go put a price  
 For shoes, rice  

126 
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:21,040 
Marked  "She" and "Him"  

127 
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:25,169 
 You will see that love  
 Is all that tells  

128 
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:33,845 
Cole Porter asked   
 What is love?  

129 
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:41,188 
 If you have not been answered yet  
 Dear Mr. Porter  

130 
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:46,660 
 is what we do not know what love is  

131 
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:51,332 
 But we can tell you what it looks  

132 
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:55,934 
 is the least we can do  

133 
00:09:57,113 --> 00:10:00,605 
 You listen, Porter  

134 
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:06,479 
It must be nice   
 Yes, really cool  

135 
00:10:06,656 --> 00:10:09,591 
 The only remedy to celibacy chronic  

136 
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:12,523 
 Go put a price  
 For shoes, rice  

137 
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,061 
Marked  "She" and "Him"  

138 
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:18,792 
 And you will see that love  
 Is all that tells  

139 
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:21,835 
 Love is all that is said  

140 
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:24,871 
 Love is all that is said  

141 
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,977 
 Love is all that is said  

142 
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:36,451 
A beautiful plant, right? 

143 
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,712 
Sit down. 

144 
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:40,947 
Thank you. 

145 
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,975 
Surprise! 

146 
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:10,014 
- It's all for me? 
- Stop doing the baby 

147 
00:11:10,186 --> 00:11:12,586 
and open your gifts. We gotta go. 

148 
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,953 
- A nightgown. 
- You like? 

149 
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,254 
- So? 
- Superb. 

150 
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,124 
- Splendid. 
- Put that when they say: 

151 
00:11:22,298 --> 00:11:25,199 
"Women and children first" 
they know. 

152 
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:29,529 
Slippers and perfume. 
The girls adore. 

153 
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,371 
And a dictionary. 
Everything I need. 

154 
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,571 
- And the invoice. 
- Give me that. 

155 
00:11:36,746 --> 00:11:38,805 
How it got there? 

156 
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:43,382 
Girls. 

157 
00:11:44,153 --> 00:11:45,780 
Where did you get the money for it? 

158 
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,413 
We refuse to answer 
because it could put us in question. 

159 
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:54,662 
Do not look at me, I'll cry. 

160 
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,229 
- Take that. 
- Go ahead. 

161 
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:05,533 
Where can I find Miss Jackson? 

162 
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,040 
We must wait outside with the others. 

163 
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,111 
You do not understand, 
I represent the government. 

164 
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:14,278 
- Our government? 
- Yes. 

165 
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,444 
It is worse than I thought. 

166 
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,317 
On stage. 

167 
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,229 
Donna, you wanted some cake? 
A big part. 

168 
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,369 
I ask you forgiveness. 

169 
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:43,438 
Miss Jackson? 

170 
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:55,215 
A speech. 

171 
00:12:56,892 --> 00:12:57,916 
No. 

172 
00:12:58,093 --> 00:12:59,685 
We want  Jackson.  

173 
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,832 
I do not know what to say. 

174 
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,231 
Imagine the government choose me 

175 
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:12,636 
to represent the American theater 
Festival of Paris. 

176 
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:14,139 
Why not? 

177 
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,437 
I could not believe it 
when I received the letter. 

178 
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:20,104 
I must be a representative sample. 

179 
00:13:20,282 --> 00:13:23,410 
Or perhaps it is 
because I represent the equity? 

180 
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:27,055 
Tomorrow everything will be more 
a big mistake. 

181 
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,520 
Miss Jackson ... 

182 
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,927 
I guess everyone has the right, 
once in his life, 

183 
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:36,291 
a great moment. 

184 
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,066 
This is mine, this is my big moment. 

185 
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:43,664 
I'll remember all my life. 

186 
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:50,007 
If someone says that I cried, 
I knocks. 

187 
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:51,840 
If it is not already. 

188 
00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:57,475 
- Bon voyage. 
- Promised. 

189 
00:13:57,653 --> 00:13:59,621 
Do nothing that I would not do. 

190 
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:01,255 
If you can hold you back. 

191 
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,412 
Goodbye. 

192 
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:05,724 
Thank you again, girls. 

193 
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,695 
Miss Jackson? 

194 
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:17,304 
Zippers. 

195 
00:14:17,473 --> 00:14:19,168 
I would like to introduce myself. 

196 
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:20,638 
I beg you. 

197 
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:23,209 
S. Winthrop Putnam 
Department of State. 

198 
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,713 
I'm sorry. 

199 
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:27,075 
Magic. 

200 
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:35,818 
I imagine any old 
with a beard before. 

201 
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:39,893 
- Forgive me if I disappointed you. 
- No. 

202 
00:14:40,062 --> 00:14:42,428 
- You agree very well. 
- Thanks. 

203 
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:44,657 
Can I put the cake? 

204 
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,097 
I've had enough. 

205 
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:50,397 
You have the passport and the ticket? 
The boat leaves on Friday. 

206 
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:52,541 
That's what I want to talk about. 

207 
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,336 
- You go there all the time, I guess? 
- Where? 

208 
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:57,069 
In Europe, I mean. 

209 
00:14:57,246 --> 00:15:00,443 
I've never been anywhere 
where the subway does not drive. 

210 
00:15:00,616 --> 00:15:02,948 
And now I'm off to Paris, France. 

211 
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:04,244 
Thanks to you. 

212 
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,978 
I could kiss you for that. 

213 
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,090 
- That's what I'll do. 
- No, Miss Jackson. 

214 
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,655 
In your speech, 
you were talking to an error. 

215 
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,661 
- And then? 
- That's exactly what happened. 

216 
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,891 
There was a letter to Ethel Jackson 

217 
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:21,935 
about a work permit 
a cabaret 

218 
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:23,366 
in Montreal, I think. 

219 
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:26,736 
Do not worry about it. 
Can I cancel Montreal to Paris. 

220 
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:29,070 
Only the Eskimos there. 

221 
00:15:29,244 --> 00:15:32,179 
And there was a letter 
for Miss Ethel Barrymore 

222 
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,475 
asking 
to represent the United States 

223 
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,244 
International Arts Festival. 

224 
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:43,120 
I'm sorry. 
I hope you understand. 

225 
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:45,287 
Everything is canceled? 

226 
00:15:45,894 --> 00:15:47,327 
That's right. 

227 
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:49,964 
Sorry to have confused the letters. 

228 
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:53,358 
Sure. 

229 
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:58,472 
Imagine Ethel Barrymore 
play in this rat trap in Montreal? 

230 
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:02,338 
The State Department would appreciate 
you do not tell anyone. 

231 
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:04,945 
The Department of Justice 
would investigate, 

232 
00:16:05,114 --> 00:16:09,414 
This would be a bit annoying, 
because it is we who are investigating them. 

233 
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:11,549 
Imagine the girls. 

234 
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,212 
They are put into four 
for all these gifts ... 

235 
00:16:15,824 --> 00:16:18,486 
It is the most beautiful thing 
that ever happened to me. 

236 
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:20,086 
And now ... 

237 
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:23,356 
Miss Jackson, I know exactly 
what you feel. 

238 
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:25,022 
How can you? 

239 
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:31,002 
When I was a kid in Boston 
my father bought me a rifle. 

240 
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:34,768 
A 22 mm, I was 12. 

241 
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:37,741 
I had never seen anything more beautiful. 

242 
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:42,907 
We were out hunting in Maine 
and I caught chickenpox. 

243 
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,212 
Why do not you be fired? 

244 
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:48,584 
It's your fault, 
you have confused the letters. 

245 
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,157 
Without you, I would not have been 
so enthusiastic. 

246 
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:53,226 
- I can do something? 
- Yes. 

247 
00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:56,660 
Add it to your friend in Washington. 
I will not need it. 

248 
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:59,494 
- If you listen to my version ... 
- Exit. 

249 
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:02,603 
You'll grow a beard. 

250 
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:05,939 
Next year I am voting for Anthony Eden. 

251 
00:17:36,338 --> 00:17:39,136 
 April in Paris  

252 
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:45,474 
 chestnut flowers  

253 
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,610 
 tables are out  

254 
00:17:50,018 --> 00:17:55,046 
 Under the trees  

255 
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:58,250 
 April in Paris  

256 
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:04,359 
 Feeling  

257 
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,094 
 That person could never  

258 
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:12,705 
 Painter  

259 
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:18,108 
 I never knew  
The charm of spring   

260 
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:24,017 
'd never hit so close  

261 
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:30,549 
 I do not know  
 That my heart could sing  

262 
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:37,589 
 No warm embrace  
 had never missed  

263 
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:43,671 
 Till April in Paris  

264 
00:18:45,574 --> 00:18:50,511 
 to turn to?  

265 
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:57,884 
 What did you make me  

266 
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:05,050 
 heart  

267 
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:22,075 
Hello, Mr. Putnam. 

268 
00:19:30,986 --> 00:19:32,954 
Mr. Sherman is waiting for you, Mr. Putnam. 

269 
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:34,986 
He learned the good news. 

270 
00:19:35,157 --> 00:19:37,182 
- Really? 
- Go ahead. 

271 
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:52,239 
At the right loan. 

272 
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:01,344 
I know what you mean, sir, 
and I deserve it. 

273 
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:06,314 
I congratulate you, my boy, 
it is good work. 

274 
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:08,752 
I am in Department 10 years 

275 
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:11,484 
and it was the diplomatic mission 
The most difficult 

276 
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,823 
from an explorer 
was lost at the Pentagon. 

277 
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:19,361 
Imagine naming a dancer 
to represent the American theater. 

278 
00:20:19,534 --> 00:20:23,630 
- I take full responsibility. 
- It was a stroke of genius. 

279 
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,829 
Oh yeah? 

280 
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:28,875 
I do not know how the news services 
have known, but I'm delighted. 

281 
00:20:29,044 --> 00:20:30,909 
Look at all these telegrams. 

282 
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:33,809 
You have captured the popular imagination. 

283 
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,314 
I saw the young lady and told her ... 

284 
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,817 
"A representative of ordinary people." 

285 
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,683 
She threw my hat 
and her babydoll face. 

286 
00:20:41,857 --> 00:20:45,953 
The Department of Labour: 
"250,000 new voters." 

287 
00:20:46,128 --> 00:20:48,688 
250 000 new votes for our party. 

288 
00:20:48,864 --> 00:20:51,389 
And Anthony Eden. 

289 
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,725 
Winthrop, here passports 
for our group. 

290 
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:57,633 
Joshua Stevens 
the greatest American artist. 

291 
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,643 
Sinclair Wilson 
our greatest man of letters. 

292 
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,370 
Joseph Weimar 
one of our greatest composers. 

293 
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:09,273 
And "Miss Ethel S. Jackson." 

294 
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:11,348 
How to describe? 

295 
00:21:12,154 --> 00:21:14,418 
Just say: "A beautiful plant." 

296 
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:20,119 
This is top secret 
or any girl can she get? 

297 
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:22,855 
- Marcia. 
- Hello, darling. 

298 
00:21:23,498 --> 00:21:25,295 
That's nothing. 

299 
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,295 
And so, for something. 

300 
00:21:29,471 --> 00:21:31,063 
Congratulations, honey. 

301 
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:34,003 
I heard your feat. 
How to do you think? 

302 
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:37,043 
It came to me by sending a letter. 

303 
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,407 
I just talked to Senator Owen. 

304 
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:42,072 
There is a vacancy 
Council of Labour. 

305 
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,447 
One member of the board 
back to work. 

306 
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,418 
We accept no small job. 

307 
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:51,718 
We want the seat of Massachusetts 
the Senate. 

308 
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,828 
Oh yeah? Is large enough 
for both of us? 

309 
00:21:54,997 --> 00:21:57,795 
Right now, you're the darling 
Capitol Hill. 

310 
00:21:57,966 --> 00:22:01,993 
What you have done is perhaps 
a springboard to the White House. 

311 
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:05,571 
Come, do not we dream a little too much? 

312 
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:09,242 
I do not have the qualifications. 

313 
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:12,913 
No, it's too wacky. 

314 
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:18,018 
Never doubt the power of a woman 
who wants to be First Lady. 

315 
00:22:18,286 --> 00:22:20,117 
Goodbye, darling. 

316 
00:22:20,622 --> 00:22:22,886 
- Continue like that. 
- I'll go with you. 

317 
00:22:23,058 --> 00:22:24,923 
You have more important things to do. 

318 
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,459 
- Dad will accompany me. 
- Come, my dear. 

319 
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:31,087 
Dad, can you assign 
a larger office in Winthrop? 

320 
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,667 
I could demote 
and give him mine. 

321 
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:37,595 
Maybe. 

322 
00:22:38,407 --> 00:22:40,375 
As a wedding gift. 

323 
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,234 
-  Yes, sir  
- Tracy? 

324 
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,311 
Send a telegram 
Miss Ethel S. Jackson. 

325 
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,938 
At 128 West 48th Street, 
in New York. 

326 
00:23:22,117 --> 00:23:23,175 
The plans have changed. 

327 
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:26,115 
Pack your bags 
to be picked up. 

328 
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,123 
At 16 pm tomorrow to embark. 

329 
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,054 
Signed, the President. 

330 
00:23:31,226 --> 00:23:32,250 
 Who  

331 
00:23:33,195 --> 00:23:35,129 
S. Winthrop Putnam, of course. 

332 
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:46,837 
 Ladies and gentlemen,  
 President of the United States.  

333 
00:23:54,716 --> 00:23:59,346 
Mr. President of Congress, Mr. President 
of the House of Representatives. 

334 
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:02,649 
Dear Members of Congress. 

335 
00:24:02,824 --> 00:24:05,486 
 I have the honor to submit  

336 
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:09,096 
 My report on the state of the Union  

337 
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:16,836 
 is an honor and a privilege  

338 
00:24:17,005 --> 00:24:20,441 
 A privilege and an honor  

339 
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,509 
 come to this day  

340 
00:24:22,677 --> 00:24:23,939 
 to repeat  

341 
00:24:24,112 --> 00:24:26,273 
 Let each of our 48 states  

342 
00:24:26,448 --> 00:24:30,043 
 East, as I will soon show  
 certainty and absolute  

343 
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:33,278 
 And I say in a firm  
 that you understand  

344 
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:37,789 
 Each state is thriving  

345 
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,657 
 my last interview with the firm  

346 
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:47,495 
 There were no debt  

347 
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:50,866 
 The budget is balanced  
 credit  

348 
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,597 
 Did I say balanced  

349 
00:24:52,774 --> 00:24:54,639 
 I withdraw the word  

350 
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:58,267 
We are more that balancing   

351 
00:24:58,446 --> 00:25:01,745 
 You will be pleased to know  

352 
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,784 
 What we found money  

353 
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,948 
 go  

354 
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,324 
I therefore reaffirm   

355 
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:17,124 
 And I said to my  

356 
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:20,498 
Sixth  term  

357 
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:24,532 
What  all 48 states  

358 
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:28,107 
 East, as I will soon show  
 one certainty and absolute  

359 
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,744 
 I say definitely  
 that you understand  

360 
00:25:31,546 --> 00:25:36,040 
 Each state is thriving  

361 
00:25:41,323 --> 00:25:43,518 
 robins sing around me  

362 
00:25:43,692 --> 00:25:45,489 
 Life, what a delight  

363 
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:50,130 
 Do not think power  
 Exchange the Treasury against it  

364 
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,532 
 sunlight dances around me  

365 
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:55,465 
 Life, what a delight  

366 
00:25:56,204 --> 00:25:58,297 
 Luck is on my side  

367 
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,134 
Imagine my bliss   

368 
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,037 
 Street  

369 
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,270 
 I walk hopping  
 I happily humming tunes  

370 
00:26:05,447 --> 00:26:06,846 
 Again  

371 
00:26:07,015 --> 00:26:11,247 
 That life can be more fun  
That  Barnum and Bailey  

372 
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:13,717 
 Gay as a lark  

373 
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,549 
 Life, what a delight  

374 
00:26:16,391 --> 00:26:18,689 
 moods, I do not know  

375 
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,657 
 I come  

376 
00:26:21,263 --> 00:26:23,231 
 Life, what a delight  

377 
00:26:59,301 --> 00:27:02,566 
 Life will be a joy every day  

378 
00:28:09,204 --> 00:28:12,537 
 Life, what a delight today  

379 
00:28:27,088 --> 00:28:28,715 
Who would have thought a French 

380 
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,950 
would borrow 
another French United States? 

381 
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,391 
No, really, you saved my life. 

382 
00:28:34,562 --> 00:28:36,427 
Here is your reservation. 

383 
00:28:36,598 --> 00:28:40,034 
- The Royal Suite on the main deck. 
- Thank you, sir. 

384 
00:28:42,504 --> 00:28:46,065 
- I'm here. 
- Simone, my little pigeon. 

385 
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:48,471 
- Philippe. 
- You also go by boat? 

386 
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,634 
You remember our last trip? 

387 
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,177 
From this last night? 

388 
00:28:52,347 --> 00:28:55,407 
You remember this, this and that? 

389 
00:28:59,187 --> 00:29:00,779 
We continue? 

390 
00:29:00,955 --> 00:29:03,355 
The first few minutes, 
it is always like that. 

391 
00:29:03,525 --> 00:29:05,083 
You get the picture. 

392 
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,387 
I think so. This is my wife. 

393 
00:29:15,537 --> 00:29:16,697 
Exactly. 

394 
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:35,185 
- Here I am, gentlemen. 
- Professor Weimar. 

395 
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,517 
You know Sinclair Wilson 
Joshua Stevens? 

396 
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:41,355 
Very good. They left 
In my last concert. 

397 
00:29:42,263 --> 00:29:46,859 
Our government is about 
to launch another noble experiment. 

398 
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:51,472 
Three of the greatest minds of this country 
will travel to Paris with a dancer. 

399 
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:54,972 
Everything happens to me with 20 years behind. 

400 
00:29:55,777 --> 00:29:57,074 
Trent. 

401 
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:58,905 
Dad. 

402 
00:30:00,648 --> 00:30:03,014 
I knew you forget your pills. 

403 
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:04,708 
Me too. 

404 
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,645 
Dad, 

405 
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:08,948 
I should not go to sea? 

406 
00:30:09,123 --> 00:30:11,557 
Everyone does, 
even dancers. 

407 
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,524 
It is a terrible grip on Winthrop. 

408 
00:30:14,696 --> 00:30:16,288 
Do not show him your concern. 

409 
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:19,058 
- You can see it? 
- As an old petticoat. 

410 
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,394 
Let him go alone. 

411 
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,830 
When he is in Paris, 

412 
00:30:22,003 --> 00:30:24,972 
He will care for you in Washington. 

413 
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:27,164 
Very good. You're a clever mind. 

414 

I look like my daughter. 

415 
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,505 
- What's the holdup? 
- Where is he? 

416 
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,341 
He sought Miss Jackson 
home. 

417 
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:40,579 
Miss Jackson, open this gate. 

418 
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,416 
Did you get my telegram? 

419 
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,650 
Yes, Western Union 
would not send my reply. 

420 
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:47,021 
Go. 

421 
00:30:49,564 --> 00:30:52,658 
- How did you get? 
- I have a friend at the FBI. 

422 
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:55,098 
And the Red Cross? 

423 
00:30:56,471 --> 00:30:58,803 
I know I've treated 
meanly, 

424 
00:30:58,973 --> 00:31:01,237 
but you need the government 
to cooperate. 

425 
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:02,603 
- Cooperate? 
- Yes. 

426 
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:03,869 
She is very good. 

427 
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:07,037 
It's been 10 years that Uncle Sam takes 
heavily on my pay 

428 
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:09,183 
and now I owe him. 

429 
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,818 
What have you done with my $ 200 
last year? 

430 
00:31:11,986 --> 00:31:14,477 
I assure you 
they were well spent. 

431 
00:31:14,656 --> 00:31:17,250 
By sending letters 
the wrong people. 

432 
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,957 
- I just check. 
- Leave me alone. 

433 
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,618 
I have a duty to perform. 

434 
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:26,165 
It means nothing to you that 
I spent three years up to the festival? 

435 
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:30,202 
- Try it with a violin. 
- Miss Jackson, you do not laugh. 

436 
00:31:34,342 --> 00:31:36,276 
Do you know what my title? 

437
00:31:37,345 --> 00:31:40,837
Wizard Wizard
Deputy Secretary of State.

438
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,742
I took 10 years to get that far.

439
00:31:43,918 --> 00:31:46,352
If this fails,
I will return to square one.

440
00:31:46,521 --> 00:31:50,184
Wizard Wizard
the assistant to the Deputy Secretary of State.

441
00:31:50,358 --> 00:31:52,952
It is a real affair of state, tell me.

442
00:31:55,396 --> 00:31:57,193
Miss Jackson

443
00:31:57,966 --> 00:32:00,400
Have you ever been to Paris in the spring?

444
00:32:00,568 --> 00:32:01,899
Are you kidding?

445
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:05,039
The prince and I'll always be
going to Monte Carlo.

446
00:32:05,206 --> 00:32:08,505
No beautiful young lady
should miss this.

447
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:12,442
The cafes on the sidewalk,
champagne, songs.

448
00:32:12,614 --> 00:32:15,606
- Who sings?
- In Paris, everybody sings.

449
00:32:16,317 --> 00:32:17,545
All the time.

450
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:19,550
It's like that there.

451
00:32:23,725 --> 00:32:26,489
This will soon be spring in Paris.

452
00:32:26,661 --> 00:32:29,596
Children dancing
the Bois de Boulogne.

453
00:32:29,764 --> 00:32:31,925
- Bolognaise?
- Boulogne.

454
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:36,901
Men will be selling hot chestnuts
with their little carts.

455
00:32:37,071 --> 00:32:38,504
Chestnuts.

456
00:32:38,673 --> 00:32:43,940
And everywhere, young couples hugging
to kiss.

457
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,648
Do not sacrifice this trip
because you hate me.

458
00:32:48,816 --> 00:32:50,977
But I do not hate you.

459
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:53,950
You make so much effort
I'm starting to believe you.

460
00:32:54,122 --> 00:32:57,285
If you come to use
your $ 200?

461
00:32:57,458 --> 00:33:01,519
You may encounter a beautiful
young man and return to your cost.

462
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,194
You know what?

463
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:06,563
I might try it, yes.

464
00:33:07,001 --> 00:33:09,333
I'll help you pack your bags.

465
00:33:11,272 --> 00:33:15,231
- These bags are already made.
- What good is a waste of time!

466
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:41,791
 When you're burning me too 

467
00:33:42,704 --> 00:33:45,901
 I implore you, madam 

468
00:33:46,908 --> 00:33:49,035
 hand me your lips 

469
00:33:51,045 --> 00:33:55,345
 Do not whisper: "Let me time" 

470
00:33:56,517 --> 00:33:59,645
 Keep your reasons 
 your rhymes for you 

471
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,685
 Give me your lips 

472
00:34:03,658 --> 00:34:08,459
 Madam, somewhere, a ghost island 

473
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:13,157
 just waiting for our ghost ship 

474
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,131
We will  

475
00:34:17,672 --> 00:34:22,939
 giving me hope 
You'll be mine  

476
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:27,210
 Give me everything that is most sublime 

477
00:34:28,683 --> 00:34:31,311
 Give me your lips 

478
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:41,823
 Give me your lips 

479
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:47,361
 Madam, somewhere, a ghost island 

480
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,604
 just waiting for our ghost ship 

481
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,604
We will  

482
00:34:55,910 --> 00:35:01,507
 giving me hope 
You'll be mine  

483
00:35:02,383 --> 00:35:05,477
 Give me everything that is most sublime 

484
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:14,125
 Give me your lips 

485
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,092
Philip!

486
00:35:26,073 --> 00:35:27,199
She leaves a big tip.

487
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,401
Philip, you just calm down in the kitchen.

488
00:35:30,578 --> 00:35:32,341
See you later, miss.

489
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:42,146
You think a good example

490
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:43,483
to other servers?

491
00:35:43,658 --> 00:35:46,058
Yes, the question is,
can they go?

492
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,025
You should thank me
for this opportunity

493
00:35:49,197 --> 00:35:50,824
Working to return to France.

494
00:35:50,998 --> 00:35:53,865
Instead, you will not cause me
but trouble.

495
00:35:54,035 --> 00:35:57,835
But I did not ask to be a waiter.
If I could talk to the commander,

496
00:35:58,005 --> 00:36:01,441
I explained that
I could pay my travel in 1st class.

497
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:04,578
- Upon our arrival in France.
- The commander is ill.

498
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:05,939
He sees no one.

499
00:36:06,113 --> 00:36:09,173
And I'm sure
he was not impressed

500
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,318
because you are Philippe Fouquet.

501
00:36:11,485 --> 00:36:13,214
I seem to be the one to be.

502
00:36:13,387 --> 00:36:16,618
If I still need to complain,
when will the captain standing

503
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:18,782
He will return to the United States,

504
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,087
where you will spend the rest of your life.

505
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,991
I beg you not when I eat.

506
00:36:23,164 --> 00:36:28,158
Yesterday you made
breakfast in bed for a young lady

507
00:36:28,336 --> 00:36:30,896
and you're there remained until after lunch.

508
00:36:31,072 --> 00:36:32,767
Tomorrow, I'll go away.

509
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,372
You are so French.

510
00:36:39,213 --> 00:36:41,147
Go take care of your table.

511
00:36:41,315 --> 00:36:43,476
I promise not to tell the captain.

512
00:36:43,651 --> 00:36:46,814
Mr. Leader, I love you.

513
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,016
If only you knew how to cook.

514
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,889
I'm sorry.

515
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:33,556
What was I thinking?

516
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:44,338
Miss Jackson
you use the teaspoon

517
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,446
instead of the spoon broth.

518
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:52,214
Try to remember:
The dessert spoon is a truncated ellipse.

519
00:37:52,386 --> 00:37:55,355
Spoon broth, part of a sphere.

520
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,081
I will practice at night.

521
00:38:18,012 --> 00:38:20,344
You did not think that I would?

522
00:38:23,117 --> 00:38:25,142
Gentlemen, what have you ordered?

523
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:28,982
- The New England boiled dinner.
- With a poached egg.

524
00:38:29,323 --> 00:38:32,121
Fortunately for you,
I am a man of taste.

525
00:38:32,293 --> 00:38:37,060
I brought you to the place
coq au vin in Burgundy.

526
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:41,361
A chicken delicately flavored,
surrounded by nasty little fungus,

527
00:38:41,535 --> 00:38:45,665
swimming naked in a pool of burgundy.

528
00:38:46,607 --> 00:38:49,872
In Boston, you could use it
in public.

529
00:38:50,978 --> 00:38:55,347
I should have kept Immigration
or grease for you that you're swimming.

530
00:38:58,019 --> 00:38:59,043
Repeat this.

531
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,054
A spoonful of this rich food
surely kill me.

532
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:14,225
Better to die with it in the mouth
than live with a boiled dinner.

533
00:39:14,402 --> 00:39:15,699
Amen.

534
00:39:23,244 --> 00:39:25,405
Miss commissioned
The duckling flamed.

535
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:27,774
I will prepare before your eyes.

536
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:31,750
- That is good. This is my first time.
- Me too.

537
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,718
I'll bring my personal touch.

538
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:40,527
What a wonderful way
to drown a duck.

539
00:39:40,694 --> 00:39:44,027
It does not bother you?
After all, this is our last evening.

540
00:39:44,198 --> 00:39:47,326
Which reminds me,
your bags are ready?

541
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:51,232
I am so amused that
I could have stayed in the bag myself.

542
00:39:51,405 --> 00:39:54,670
If everything is ready,
you do anything after dinner?

543
00:39:54,842 --> 00:39:56,867
No. What were you thinking?

544
00:39:57,044 --> 00:39:59,638
I think Mr. Stevens and Mr. Weimar

545
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:03,113
should help you
for your speech at the festival.

546
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,710
If you still flamed in cognac?

547
00:40:06,887 --> 00:40:10,152
After that, Mr. Wilson spends time
with you

548
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,723
make the combination.

549
00:40:11,892 --> 00:40:15,157
Irregular verbs,
that you pose so many problems.

550
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,797
- Then we could find.
- With joy.

551
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,995
To study the protocol.
You'll find it quite interesting.

552
00:40:23,871 --> 00:40:25,771
Gentlemen, I have heard enough.

553
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,534
It has been four days since
I serve this table.

554
00:40:28,709 --> 00:40:31,542
And nobody out
one word romantic

555
00:40:31,712 --> 00:40:33,202
this lovely lady.

556
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,144
- It's against the rules, too?
- Waiter!

557
00:40:36,317 --> 00:40:38,615
What has she done wrong?

558
00:40:38,786 --> 00:40:43,348
From what I see from where I am,
it is an incredibly attractive young woman.

559
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,152
- Thank you, boy.
- Of course I could be wrong.

560
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:49,228
But I have at least half right.

561
00:40:49,396 --> 00:40:51,921
Boy, so we'll look
our dessert.

562
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:55,068
Sir, your dessert is right here.

563
00:40:55,236 --> 00:40:58,433
Tonight, there was a dance in the great hall.

564
00:40:58,606 --> 00:41:01,200
I noticed as the young lady
you looked

565
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,570
when she takes the wrong spoon.

566
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,904
Believe me, sir.

567
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:07,104
If you take him to the ball tonight

568
00:41:07,281 --> 00:41:09,545
you'll thank me
for the rest of your life.

569
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,082
Oh yeah?

570
00:41:11,252 --> 00:41:14,244
This is outrageous.
I will report to the captain.

571
00:41:14,421 --> 00:41:15,854
Not so fast.

572
00:41:16,023 --> 00:41:18,082
There are 24 complaints before you.

573
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:21,956
It is right for one thing.
I'd love to go to the ball tonight.

574
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,029
It's out of question.

575
00:41:24,198 --> 00:41:26,098
You have too much to do.

576
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:30,598
It's out of question.
You have too much to do.

577
00:41:31,472 --> 00:41:34,441
Miss Jackson
I am no longer young

578
00:41:34,608 --> 00:41:36,075
and I do not dance very well.

579
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:41,977
My feet are tired of having served
long hours of breakfast in bed.

580
00:41:42,149 --> 00:41:46,210
But if you do me the honor
accompany me to the ball

581
00:41:46,387 --> 00:41:48,355
I am a young man again.

582
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:51,690
It is the most beautiful invitation of my life.

583
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:55,989
If you want to shame the delegation
going to the prom with a server ...

584
00:41:56,163 --> 00:42:00,031
- In this case, I can take.
- You will not do that.

585
00:42:00,868 --> 00:42:03,063
And you, young lady,
finish your dinner.

586
00:42:03,237 --> 00:42:05,899
Forget this nonsense
and reach your cabin.

587
00:42:06,073 --> 00:42:07,267
Enough.

588
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:10,103
I did not ask to come
I was invited.

589
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,336
In fact, I was almost forced.

590
00:42:12,513 --> 00:42:16,074
Sorry if I demeans the standing
This agreement pallbearers,

591
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,378
but I have enough to obey.
I shall not finish my dinner.

592
00:42:19,553 --> 00:42:23,148
I will not in my room.
I do not know what I'll do.

593
00:42:23,324 --> 00:42:26,953
Listen to my advice, hang well
your life jackets.

594
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:30,119
- Miss Jackson.
- Sit down, Winthrop.

595
00:42:30,831 --> 00:42:33,800
Eat this duck, goose species.

596
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,959
I hope you like it cooked.

597
00:42:37,738 --> 00:42:38,932
Waiter!

598
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:40,998
Do something.

599
00:42:41,175 --> 00:42:42,870
Does it help?

600
00:42:53,454 --> 00:42:55,217
It's wonderful, Philip.

601
00:42:55,389 --> 00:42:58,881
- The whole trip should be like this.
- He's going to be patience.

602
00:42:59,059 --> 00:43:02,586
In a few minutes, Mr. Putnam
will be enough to play chess.

603
00:43:02,763 --> 00:43:05,789
He will pick you
I will tap on the shoulder ...

604
00:43:05,966 --> 00:43:08,298
- You see?
- Philippe.

605
00:43:09,236 --> 00:43:12,000
- Hello.
- Mademoiselle, I am very embarrassed

606
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:15,005
but do you know
that this man is a steward?

607
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,699
She is an angel.

608
00:43:18,145 --> 00:43:21,239
- Fouquet has remade his own.
- If you allow ...

609
00:43:21,415 --> 00:43:23,110
It is impossible.

610
00:43:23,284 --> 00:43:27,186
We have been very lenient with you,
but you went too far.

611
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:32,155
Sorry, miss, you can stay
but not your joyous companion.

612
00:43:32,326 --> 00:43:34,385
In this case, I still do not.

613
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:38,361
Come, my dear.
We will continue on another boat.

614
00:43:42,136 --> 00:43:44,627
I'm sorry
you're put on your 31.

615
00:43:44,805 --> 00:43:47,365
It was very nice of you
for inviting me tonight

616
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,270
but I returned to my cabin.

617
00:43:50,411 --> 00:43:53,710
Would you like to live a life
boiled dinners

618
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,872
- And poached eggs?
- No.

619
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,848
And spend your evenings
to study programs?

620
00:43:59,019 --> 00:44:00,043
No.

621
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:04,156
Do you prefer to rely entirely
the hands of a French

622
00:44:04,325 --> 00:44:09,228
who has imagination, joy of living
and years and years of experience?

623
00:44:11,031 --> 00:44:13,261
Lafayette, I'm here.

624
00:44:16,503 --> 00:44:20,633
Cinderella has to go to the ball
albeit by the back door.

625
00:44:25,979 --> 00:44:29,540
Unleash the room.
The ball will start.

626
00:44:29,717 --> 00:44:31,912
Philip, are you crazy?

627
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,145
- Where have you been?
- There is work.

628
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:35,948
Yes, there is work.

629
00:44:36,123 --> 00:44:40,457
This charming young lady
on the boat for four whole nights

630
00:44:40,627 --> 00:44:41,924
and nothing has happened yet.

631
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,996
- Nothing.
- Impossible.

632
00:44:44,164 --> 00:44:46,632
And on a French ship!

633
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,963
Do you know what that little
spent his evenings?

634
00:44:50,404 --> 00:44:52,133
To conjugate verbs.

635
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:58,004
The honor of France is at stake

636
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:02,609
Can we let her in America
without a spouse?

637
00:45:03,984 --> 00:45:07,181
No, gentlemen, never.
I pray you, sit down.

638
00:45:07,354 --> 00:45:10,187
Even if the grand salon We are prohibited,

639
00:45:10,357 --> 00:45:12,348
we have our ball here.

640
00:45:14,395 --> 00:45:17,853
Well, my friends.
You are timid or the French?

641
00:45:18,031 --> 00:45:19,726
French!

642
00:46:38,111 --> 00:46:40,272
Sorry for the delay
your baking,

643
00:46:40,447 --> 00:46:42,176
but the food was packed.

644
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:44,544
Let's drink to French cuisine.

645
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:48,313
- My stomach will never be the same.
- This is a unique evening.

646
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:51,720
All servers are dancing in the kitchen
even the head.

647
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:55,020
And your young lady danced
with each of them.

648
00:46:55,195 --> 00:46:57,220
The true spirit of democracy.

649
00:46:58,866 --> 00:47:03,269
And now, gentlemen, I leave you.
The next dance is for me.

650
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:10,006
Gentlemen, it was a noble experiment,
but it did not work.

651
00:47:10,177 --> 00:47:12,839
We ran out of kindness.
Miss Jackson is young ...

652
00:47:13,013 --> 00:47:15,447
- She should be told immediately ...
- And beautiful.

653
00:47:15,616 --> 00:47:18,050
... we are bringing the United States.

654
00:47:18,218 --> 00:47:21,415
Sir, I am not totally
agree with you,

655
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:25,319
but if you so desire,
I beg you not to be harsh with her.

656
00:47:25,492 --> 00:47:27,426
I will not be hard.

657
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,562
For it is yours to do.

658
00:47:31,899 --> 00:47:34,390
Very good, sir. I'll tell him.

659
00:47:36,136 --> 00:47:39,367
But it may be that his reaction is violent.

660
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:46,710
Mr. Weimar, if I do not return,

661
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,040
finish the game

662
00:48:12,272 --> 00:48:17,141
The representative of this great country
for which we have so much respect before ...

663
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,541
- What is it already?
- The United States.

664
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,307
Let's drink to the health of the United States.

665
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,009
Sorry, I never drink.

666
00:48:27,187 --> 00:48:29,883
The man refuses to drink
the health of his country?

667
00:48:30,057 --> 00:48:32,321
Which is the official?

668
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:35,484
- It'll make the one in Moscow.
- Sure.

669
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,789
Give me that.
I do not want the committee

670
00:48:37,965 --> 00:48:40,559
investigating committees,
investigate me.

671
00:48:40,734 --> 00:48:42,099
That's better.

672
00:48:42,269 --> 00:48:43,429
United States.

673
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:49,573
And not for France?

674
00:48:52,946 --> 00:48:54,846
It is very important to drink to France.

675
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,039
In France.

676
00:49:04,091 --> 00:49:08,755
Miss Jackson, I promise you that in Paris
this will be the same every night.

677
00:49:08,929 --> 00:49:11,796
I unlock my money
and you unlock me, me.

678
00:49:11,965 --> 00:49:13,489
I do not want to stop now.

679
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:14,691
I prances.

680
00:49:18,305 --> 00:49:23,470
 For three nights in a row 
 It forced me to calm down 

681
00:49:24,244 --> 00:49:27,975
 And say I did not like the role 

682
00:49:29,149 --> 00:49:36,146
 Thanks to you, my friends 
 This little game is over 

683
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:43,618
 And you forgive me 
 If I lose a little control 

684
00:49:47,334 --> 00:49:49,894
 I do not care what I did last night 

685
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,335
 And the night before 
 And the other night as before 

686
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:57,809
 I'll ring the bell tonight 
 I'll ring the bell tonight 

687
00:49:57,978 --> 00:50:00,845
 That's what I'll do 

688
00:50:01,014 --> 00:50:04,780
 I radiate joy and I feel 
On  mood to party 

689
00:50:05,118 --> 00:50:07,586
That hangs  Commander 
 crew 

690
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:11,417
 It blew the plug tonight 
 It blew the plug tonight 

691
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:14,355
 That's what I'll do 

692
00:50:14,528 --> 00:50:18,089
 And when the band 
 Will his five-minute break 

693
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,859
 You'll want 
It  it resumes 

694
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:25,337
 your health, my health 
 a life full of joy 

695
00:50:25,505 --> 00:50:27,905
 Me I oops-there-boom 

696
00:50:28,075 --> 00:50:31,977
 The boat will pitch tonight 
 The boat will pitch tonight 

697
00:50:32,145 --> 00:50:34,670
's what we gonna do 

698
00:50:35,048 --> 00:50:38,506
When a violinist  danced his fiddle 

699
00:50:41,688 --> 00:50:45,215
 It makes me want to jiggle my 

700
00:50:45,392 --> 00:50:48,156
 But it could well be the bubbles 

701
00:50:48,328 --> 00:50:51,695
 What makes this moaning saxophone 

702
00:50:55,001 --> 00:50:57,868
 Go and find a ukulele 

703
00:50:58,338 --> 00:51:01,501
And you can do  ding-dong, ding-doung 

704
00:51:01,675 --> 00:51:05,668
 your health, my 
 And a life full of joy 

705
00:51:05,846 --> 00:51:07,837
Let us therefore stick  trial 

706
00:51:08,281 --> 00:51:12,411
 The boat will pitch tonight 
 The boat will pitch tonight 

707
00:51:12,586 --> 00:51:14,986
's what we gonna do 

708
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:18,454
 I'll ring the bell 
Saut  cap 

709
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:21,753
 And if the vessel sinks 
 be too bad for them 

710
00:51:21,928 --> 00:51:24,021
 Because I "quoted" 

711
00:51:24,197 --> 00:51:25,824
Make  pitch 

712
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:31,938
 to rock the boat this evening 

713
00:51:38,278 --> 00:51:39,302
In Ethiopia!

714
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,313
In Afghanistan.

715
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:51,021
And if you think of other countries,
tell me.

716
00:51:56,563 --> 00:51:58,155
The ball is now completed.

717
00:51:58,331 --> 00:52:00,799
Cinderella returns to the heap of ashes.

718
00:52:02,803 --> 00:52:04,327
I go home quietly.

719
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:07,070
You heard me.

720
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,471
As if I did not know what
you and your cartel have expected.

721
00:52:10,644 --> 00:52:14,444
Send me the first plane
and hope he fails.

722
00:52:15,315 --> 00:52:16,441
Go ahead.

723
00:52:16,616 --> 00:52:18,481
Say I'm ashamed for my country.

724
00:52:18,652 --> 00:52:20,449
Say something.

725
00:52:20,754 --> 00:52:22,813
I have only one thing to say.

726
00:52:22,989 --> 00:52:24,456
What?

727
00:52:24,624 --> 00:52:25,989
What a beautiful plant.

728
00:52:27,427 --> 00:52:28,826
Well.

729
00:52:28,995 --> 00:52:31,156
It does not look like S. Winthrop Putnam.

730
00:52:31,331 --> 00:52:32,923
Call me Sat

731
00:52:33,099 --> 00:52:36,330
Mr. Putnam
should not be angry with Miss Jackson.

732
00:52:36,503 --> 00:52:39,199
It's my fault. I made it come here.

733
00:52:39,372 --> 00:52:41,863
I made him drink a little champagne.

734
00:52:42,042 --> 00:52:43,907
I made it dance.

735
00:52:47,881 --> 00:52:49,678
The medal will come later.

736
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,278
We dance?

737
00:52:53,553 --> 00:52:56,351
You'd better go
take a poached egg.

738
00:52:56,523 --> 00:52:59,185
Not worth the fight tonight
I'm lecturing.

739
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,896
 I do not care 
 what you did last night 

740
00:53:04,064 --> 00:53:07,727
 And the night before 
 And the other night as before 

741
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:11,999
 It rings the bell tonight 
 It rings the bell tonight 

742
00:53:12,472 --> 00:53:14,770
's what we gonna do 

743
00:55:36,816 --> 00:55:39,114
I did not know you danced
Department of State.

744
00:55:39,285 --> 00:55:41,344
It depends what state you are.

745
00:55:42,455 --> 00:55:45,083
You happen rather human.

746
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:48,853
I'll show you exactly
how I became one.

747
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,195
He  
 was, yes 

748
00:55:54,501 --> 00:55:56,526
 Now it is continental 

749
00:55:56,703 --> 00:55:59,171
 can do the same for you 

750
00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:01,068
 It rings the bell tonight 

751
00:56:01,241 --> 00:56:03,175
 It rings the bell tonight 

752
00:56:03,343 --> 00:56:05,470
That's what we're going  ...

753
00:56:31,538 --> 00:56:33,130
Mr. Putnam.

754
00:56:34,574 --> 00:56:36,542
Do not apologize
for having embraced.

755
00:56:36,709 --> 00:56:38,336
Even if you are engaged.

756
00:56:38,511 --> 00:56:41,412
- I understand.
- It does not upset you?

757
00:56:43,883 --> 00:56:45,180
In this case,

758
00:56:45,785 --> 00:56:47,047
Forgive me.

759
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:57,288
- Good night, Sam
- Good night.

760
00:57:15,882 --> 00:57:17,144
Bad cabin.

761
00:57:17,317 --> 00:57:18,545
Me too.

762
00:57:19,219 --> 00:57:20,345
Forgive me.

763
00:57:30,263 --> 00:57:32,629
- Good night, Sam
- Good night.

764
00:57:58,057 --> 00:58:00,025
It must be wonderful to go to Vassar

765
00:58:00,193 --> 00:58:02,718
and for the State Department for a father.

766
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,126
Not when we talk all the time.

767
00:58:05,865 --> 00:58:07,526
My father was a janitor.

768
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,895
Building Equitable
at 48th Street and 8th Avenue.

769
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:11,832
I like janitors.

770
00:58:12,005 --> 00:58:14,337
Me too. My father, anyway.

771
00:58:15,642 --> 00:58:19,703
Without them, the Pentagon would be in
his memo to the knees.

772
00:58:22,382 --> 00:58:24,077
- Good night.
- Good night.

773
00:59:02,488 --> 00:59:04,786
It was not an ordinary janitor.

774
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,358
He was offered a watch. Any gold.

775
00:59:07,527 --> 00:59:09,085
I have no doubt.

776
00:59:12,065 --> 00:59:14,033
- Good night, Sam
- Good night.

777
01:00:16,829 --> 01:00:18,160
You're going to marry?

778
01:00:18,331 --> 01:00:21,664
- Her father is a very important man.
- That you will marry?

779
01:00:21,834 --> 01:00:24,894
Neither one nor the other if I can prevent it.

780
01:00:25,071 --> 01:00:26,834
But this I know.

781
01:00:27,006 --> 01:00:31,102
Our engagement was announced
in the reports of Congress.

782
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,155
Well ...

783
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:14,576
- You're still the wrong cab.
- It's mine.

784
01:01:16,889 --> 01:01:18,481
Sorry.

785
01:01:30,303 --> 01:01:31,827
Wait.

786
01:01:32,171 --> 01:01:33,229
It's yours.

787
01:01:33,406 --> 01:01:35,203
I have a bigger water bottle.

788
01:01:35,641 --> 01:01:36,699
Are you sure?

789
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:39,243
Listen.

790
01:01:43,549 --> 01:01:46,416
There was a man on board
who can arrange this.

791
01:01:46,586 --> 01:01:48,884
- Who?
- Commander.

792
01:01:49,055 --> 01:01:51,080
Because he married people?

793
01:01:51,557 --> 01:01:54,526
We can then spend the night
in your cabin

794
01:01:55,328 --> 01:01:57,193
or mine,

795
01:01:57,363 --> 01:01:58,762
or both.

796
01:01:58,931 --> 01:02:01,866
It looks to me fair. Let's go.

797
01:02:02,034 --> 01:02:03,433
Incidentally,

798
01:02:03,603 --> 01:02:06,572
I love you very much,

799
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,068
Ethel.

800
01:02:08,841 --> 01:02:10,206
Me too, Sam

801
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:14,603
First, the commander.

802
01:02:15,748 --> 01:02:19,684
Miss, do you want
this man for a husband?

803
01:02:19,852 --> 01:02:20,876
Yes, I want it.

804
01:02:21,053 --> 01:02:24,284
And you, will you take
this woman in marriage?

805
01:02:24,457 --> 01:02:25,481
Yes, I want it.

806
01:02:26,259 --> 01:02:28,284
Not you. You are the witness.

807
01:02:29,695 --> 01:02:30,719
Yes, I want it.

808
01:02:30,897 --> 01:02:34,697
I now pronounce you husband and wife
by the power given to me

809
01:02:34,867 --> 01:02:37,131
as commander of that ship.

810
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:44,900
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

811
01:02:51,584 --> 01:02:54,075
I think we'd better go ...

812
01:02:54,787 --> 01:02:56,982
There is nothing else to do in the area.

813
01:02:57,156 --> 01:02:58,453
Goodbye and thank you very much.

814
01:03:00,927 --> 01:03:03,054
- Where are you?
- I am the witness.

815
01:03:04,063 --> 01:03:05,997
Now you are no more.

816
01:03:06,165 --> 01:03:07,632
Thank you for everything, Philip.

817
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,791
Go drink coffee black.

818
01:03:10,269 --> 01:03:11,702
Thank you.

819
01:03:18,578 --> 01:03:23,208
 I know a place 

820
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:27,318
 A very special place 

821
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:34,817
 Where we only can go 

822
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:40,632
 one reaches its shores 

823
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,236
 because there was no shore 

824
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:48,737
Neither  no house 
Neither  no door at all 

825
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:51,600
 Yet the place is here 

826
01:03:51,777 --> 01:03:54,746
 indeed the 

827
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:58,680
 The day you guess 

828
01:03:59,151 --> 01:04:03,349
 The place and address 

829
01:04:03,856 --> 01:04:10,159
 Will be the first day of happiness 

830
01:04:12,131 --> 01:04:14,326
 Is it far? 

831
01:04:15,067 --> 01:04:17,467
 Is almost 

832
01:04:18,538 --> 01:04:25,535
 When we kiss 
 It differs very much 

833
01:04:26,746 --> 01:04:30,307
 is the place 

834
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:36,916
 Whether you occupy in my heart 

835
01:04:58,177 --> 01:05:00,737
I've always considered that
stubborn as a fool,

836
01:05:00,913 --> 01:05:05,441
tonight you proved that
you were a stubborn romantic fool.

837
01:05:05,618 --> 01:05:06,949
I salute you.

838
01:05:09,455 --> 01:05:11,855
- Francis.
- Sure.

839
01:05:12,024 --> 01:05:13,651
Help me to open it.

840
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:17,057
But what does a busboy
in the captain's cabin?

841
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,360
He steals his liquor, why?

842
01:05:20,533 --> 01:05:21,932
This is not logical.

843
01:05:22,101 --> 01:05:25,298
A ship as large
with a commander-busboy?

844
01:05:25,471 --> 01:05:28,770
Sober you up, Philip.
I am not the commander.

845
01:05:28,941 --> 01:05:31,000
So why do you wear his jacket?

846
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:36,012
Because when you and your friends have come
knock at the door, I had to improvise.

847
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:37,680
Stop this blather.

848
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:40,250
There is more alcohol in the kitchen.

849
01:05:40,419 --> 01:05:44,082
Francis, you married my American friends.

850
01:05:44,256 --> 01:05:46,781
I'm sorry.
Tomorrow, I will divorce.

851
01:05:46,959 --> 01:05:49,723
They returned to their cabin.
We must stop them.

852
01:05:50,096 --> 01:05:52,656
They have helped many
with the Marshall Plan!

853
01:05:52,832 --> 01:05:54,094
So I have to stop.

854
01:05:54,266 --> 01:05:57,258
Say they are not married,
you imitated the commander.

855
01:05:57,436 --> 01:06:01,167
Do you realize the seriousness
of this crime on the high seas?

856
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:04,309
We'll lock me up.
You'll be returned to the United States.

857
01:06:04,477 --> 01:06:05,944
So what can we do?

858
01:06:06,112 --> 01:06:08,637
Separates them while they are on the ship.

859
01:06:08,814 --> 01:06:11,874
Once they are ashore,
you can tell them,

860
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:17,580
because the commander must never learn
what happened tonight.

861
01:06:17,757 --> 01:06:20,317
What do I never learn?

862
01:06:20,493 --> 01:06:22,051
What are you doing in my cabin?

863
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:25,493
It just steals your spirit, that's all.

864
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:30,092
I'm sick days
and the whole ship goes mad.

865
01:06:30,269 --> 01:06:32,999
We dance in the kitchen,
you steal my champagne.

866
01:06:33,172 --> 01:06:35,402
You're Fired both.

867
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:38,099
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much and good night.

868
01:06:38,277 --> 01:06:40,370
- Where are you going so fast?
- In the kitchen.

869
01:06:40,546 --> 01:06:44,073
- There was something on fire.
- Sit down, Mr. Fouquet.

870
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,512
You too.

871
01:06:48,788 --> 01:06:51,518
I wish I had a long discussion
with you.

872
01:06:51,691 --> 01:06:54,819
You could summarize
 for Reader's Digest 

873
01:06:54,994 --> 01:06:55,983
Sure.

874
01:07:11,877 --> 01:07:13,538
Toothbrush.

875
01:07:13,713 --> 01:07:16,204
I always read before going to sleep.

876
01:07:22,421 --> 01:07:25,185
You look for a cab, I on the other.

877
01:07:25,357 --> 01:07:27,086
I hate myself already.

878
01:08:11,804 --> 01:08:14,534
With the compliments of the chef,
your wedding breakfast.

879
01:08:14,707 --> 01:08:17,369
Breakfast?
It's the middle of the night.

880
01:08:17,543 --> 01:08:19,511
In fact, the night has barely begun.

881
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:22,306
- Good.
- Philip, you're drunk.

882
01:08:22,481 --> 01:08:26,884
I assure you I could not do
I'll do if I was sober.

883
01:08:27,052 --> 01:08:28,713
Philip.

884
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:32,855
I have heard of breakfast in bed
but this is ridiculous.

885
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:34,049
Forgive me.

886
01:08:34,226 --> 01:08:36,990
- I will clean it immediately.
- No.

887
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:40,790
Excuse me.

888
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:45,068
I will not for awhile.

889
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:48,466
So tell you.

890
01:08:48,641 --> 01:08:50,472
What?

891
01:08:57,950 --> 01:08:59,042
Listen ...

892
01:09:12,164 --> 01:09:14,598
I'm too busy this booth.

893
01:09:14,767 --> 01:09:17,702
It gives a bad reputation
this boat.

894
01:09:22,007 --> 01:09:23,770
You're gonna love my parents.

895
01:09:23,943 --> 01:09:25,137
Really?

896
01:09:25,311 --> 01:09:29,077
Dad is a professor
at the Institute of Technology Massa ...

897
01:09:31,116 --> 01:09:32,208
chusetts.

898
01:09:32,384 --> 01:09:34,579
No wonder you're so smart.

899
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:39,247
Enough to marry you
before you can say no.

900
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:47,792
Somewhere
I am not really married.

901
01:09:47,967 --> 01:09:49,195
Me either.

902
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:53,405
I guess you do not feel
the second year.

903
01:09:58,444 --> 01:09:59,536
Earlier than that.

904
01:10:08,651 --> 01:10:11,051
Ms. S. Winthrop Putnam.

905
01:10:11,887 --> 01:10:13,912
Ms. Sam Putnam.

906
01:10:19,495 --> 01:10:21,156
Forgive me, darling.

907
01:10:39,415 --> 01:10:40,507
Toothbrush.

908
01:10:45,288 --> 01:10:47,188
I'm so sleepy.

909
01:10:49,191 --> 01:10:51,250
Sam, what has happened?

910
01:10:51,427 --> 01:10:53,224
Is everything okay?

911
01:10:53,396 --> 01:10:54,454
Who is it?

912
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:57,531
Surely your drunkard friend Philippe
with breakfast.

913
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:00,533
He must think
it's a fun racket.

914
01:11:00,703 --> 01:11:02,170
Go!

915
01:11:02,338 --> 01:11:04,670
Take an anchor
and jump overboard.

916
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,705
What's there, young man?

917
01:11:08,844 --> 01:11:09,970
One minute.

918
01:11:10,146 --> 01:11:12,114
This is Sherman.
What do we do?

919
01:11:12,281 --> 01:11:15,876
Tell him we're married.
We can perhaps use his cabin.

920
01:11:18,521 --> 01:11:20,648
- You can not do that.
- Why not?

921
01:11:20,823 --> 01:11:24,657
I'm going to tell him gently.
After all, I'm going to marry his daughter ...

922
01:11:24,827 --> 01:11:26,226
Really?

923
01:11:26,395 --> 01:11:28,090
You'd better go there.

924
01:11:29,298 --> 01:11:31,858
What a place for a honeymoon.

925
01:11:37,306 --> 01:11:38,432
Well, young man.

926
01:11:38,607 --> 01:11:41,132
I hope you are happy with you,
tonight.

927
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:43,301
I can not say I am.

928
01:11:43,479 --> 01:11:45,470
I have nothing against a little wine

929
01:11:45,648 --> 01:11:48,879
but this scene in the kitchen,
it was a bit too much.

930
01:11:49,151 --> 01:11:52,416
- Close the door.
- I will do my best.

931
01:11:58,294 --> 01:12:00,626
- I had a nightmare.
- Really?

932
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:02,561
Indian.

933
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:07,760
You do not seem to grasp
the seriousness of the situation.

934
01:12:07,937 --> 01:12:12,135
I have something very important
I want to talk about.

935
01:12:12,975 --> 01:12:16,433
Winthrop, you must understand
that the American people ...

936
01:12:23,753 --> 01:12:26,950
expects its staff
be appointed by him,

937
01:12:27,123 --> 01:12:29,717
but do not act like him.

938
01:12:36,665 --> 01:12:39,862
And do the wedding with dancers
is no way

939
01:12:40,035 --> 01:12:41,866
to influence voters.

940
01:12:42,037 --> 01:12:45,370
If I hear more gossip
you and Miss Jackson

941
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:50,171
I do not want my daughter
to postpone his marriage with you.

942
01:12:50,346 --> 01:12:51,836
It would be right.

943
01:12:52,014 --> 01:12:54,710
And also you will destroy your career.

944
01:12:54,884 --> 01:12:57,853
I would have no choice
that you refer.

945
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:00,147
Let me read a few paragraphs

946
01:13:00,322 --> 01:13:04,224
the manual driving
Department of State.

947
01:13:06,495 --> 01:13:07,894
Trapped.

948
01:13:08,063 --> 01:13:10,395
- I'm sorry.
- I do not care for your courtesies.

949
01:13:10,566 --> 01:13:12,557
- Get me out of there.
- It was an accident.

950
01:13:12,735 --> 01:13:14,498
All this is a nightmare.

951
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:16,501
- I'll dust.
- I've had enough.

952
01:13:16,672 --> 01:13:18,503
This has already been used.

953
01:13:20,109 --> 01:13:23,306
Regardless, just listen to me.

954
01:13:23,913 --> 01:13:26,006
"Section B, paragraph 32:

955
01:13:26,182 --> 01:13:27,945
All employees of this department

956
01:13:28,117 --> 01:13:31,177
must maintain the dignity and decorum

957
01:13:31,353 --> 01:13:34,015
expected of employees
Department of State. "

958
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:35,748
It is repeated

959
01:13:35,925 --> 01:13:39,224
that any misconduct
will reflect unfavorably

960
01:13:39,395 --> 01:13:41,454
the United States government.

961
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:42,654
Yes, sir.

962
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:50,630
Who lit the fire extinguishers?

963
01:13:55,978 --> 01:13:57,240
Sam!

964
01:14:02,518 --> 01:14:05,681
Read on,
the evening is damn anyway.

965
01:14:31,547 --> 01:14:34,710
Hello, darling.
And do not say that the world is small.

966
01:14:34,884 --> 01:14:36,112
Marcia.

967
01:14:36,285 --> 01:14:37,946
You remember my name.

968
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:40,918
- Hello, Dad.
- How did you get so far?

969
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:44,651
My pocket money was so
accumulated I took a plane.

970
01:14:44,827 --> 01:14:47,022
I'm grown up now.

971
01:14:48,697 --> 01:14:52,133
We stay here or you remain standing there
play in the post?

972
01:14:52,968 --> 01:14:57,598
- Is this our little dancer?
- Not yours, dear.

973
01:14:59,074 --> 01:15:04,706
Marcia, I would like to introduce you
Mrs, Miss. ..

974
01:15:05,314 --> 01:15:06,804
Dynamite Jackson.

975
01:15:13,355 --> 01:15:15,448
Here they are.
Now they are down,

976
01:15:15,624 --> 01:15:17,888
I must say
they are not married.

977
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:20,290
You become a boiled dinner.

978
01:15:20,462 --> 01:15:22,293
They ride in their car.

979
01:15:22,464 --> 01:15:25,729
- They go through customs?
- They have diplomatic immunity.

980
01:15:25,901 --> 01:15:27,732
Yes, but not all.

981
01:15:57,766 --> 01:16:00,929
OPENING TODAY

982
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:27,522
I tell him just after the festival.

983
01:16:27,696 --> 01:16:30,722
And meanwhile,
I sleep in bathtubs?

984
01:16:37,006 --> 01:16:40,498
This meeting is important.
I will not be returned before.

985
01:16:40,676 --> 01:16:44,703
If you touch Miss Vassar 1922
Again, I beat you.

986
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:49,447
Goodnight, Sam

987
01:16:56,892 --> 01:17:00,760
- Everybody kiss you, except your wife.
- After all, France.

988
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:04,294
Who had the idea to bring that Jackson?

989
01:17:04,466 --> 01:17:06,593
We shall return soon
Winthrop but thought

990
01:17:06,769 --> 01:17:10,398
him to make an appearance,
as a democratic gesture.

991
01:17:10,572 --> 01:17:13,234
His movements are increasingly
each day.

992
01:17:13,409 --> 01:17:14,433
Calm down.

993
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:18,569
Respect for the thousands of dollars
spent to make you a lady.

994
01:17:18,747 --> 01:17:23,616
Lady or not, if Miss Cabaret continues
whisper in his ear, I freak.

995
01:17:29,491 --> 01:17:31,516
I am pleased to present

996
01:17:31,694 --> 01:17:34,322
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State

997
01:17:34,496 --> 01:17:37,056
United States of America.

998
01:17:42,905 --> 01:17:45,339
Is not that wonderful, darling?

999
01:17:54,983 --> 01:17:56,917
Ladies and gentlemen

1000
01:17:57,086 --> 01:18:00,715
delegates
International Arts Festival.

1001
01:18:00,889 --> 01:18:03,722
It is a privilege to speak
at a meeting

1002
01:18:03,892 --> 01:18:09,489
whose sole purpose is to promulgate
peace, friendship and harmony.

1003
01:18:11,433 --> 01:18:13,697
You know why I followed you?

1004
01:18:13,869 --> 01:18:16,531
I think we should get married
immediately.

1005
01:18:20,209 --> 01:18:22,575
There will be the world in the bathtub.

1006
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,207
Put on your helmets,
you hear better.

1007
01:18:28,584 --> 01:18:31,849
I do not need it, honey.
My mind is wide.

1008
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:34,716
And in this case, I use the term
deliberately.

1009
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:38,986
Here, unanimity of thought is complete.

1010
01:18:39,161 --> 01:18:44,030
Here do not rule but harmony, friendship and peace.

1011
01:18:45,734 --> 01:18:50,433
Before continuing, Mr. Putnam should you
tell what happened on the boat.

1012
01:18:50,606 --> 01:18:53,040
You should listen.
We enter the story.

1013
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:55,738
I guess.

1014
01:18:55,911 --> 01:18:58,345
I was told that in New York
you had a specialty.

1015
01:18:58,847 --> 01:19:02,339
I try to be nice, my dear,
so do not provoke me.

1016
01:19:02,518 --> 01:19:04,884
I do not want
what I might be ashamed.

1017
01:19:05,053 --> 01:19:07,851
You mean the day, of course.

1018
01:19:09,858 --> 01:19:13,021
We all
one big happy family,

1019
01:19:13,195 --> 01:19:14,719
whose words are peace,

1020
01:19:15,297 --> 01:19:16,286
Friendship

1021
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,558
and harmony.

1022
01:19:19,735 --> 01:19:22,431
I beg you, Miss Sherman.

1023
01:19:22,604 --> 01:19:25,095
Do not do that, please. Attention.

1024
01:19:25,274 --> 01:19:27,265
- No!
- Ladies ...

1025
01:19:27,442 --> 01:19:28,534
Marcia!

1026
01:19:29,645 --> 01:19:31,875
- Stop immediately!
- Miss Sherman.

1027
01:19:32,047 --> 01:19:36,313
Ms. Jackson, do not!
Winthrop, can you stop it!

1028
01:19:36,485 --> 01:19:38,350
Mr. Wilson, do something ...

1029
01:19:39,521 --> 01:19:42,217
Standing. Stop. Listen.

1030
01:19:42,391 --> 01:19:45,326
- It has begun.
- Marcia, behave yourself.

1031
01:19:45,494 --> 01:19:46,654
There.

1032
01:19:48,297 --> 01:19:51,494
Ladies, you realize
it is the international festival.

1033
01:19:51,667 --> 01:19:54,158
I think you proved demonstration

1034
01:19:54,336 --> 01:19:57,328
the need to refer
Ms Jackson in the United States.

1035
01:19:57,506 --> 01:20:00,475
- The sooner the better.
- You think you're clever.

1036
01:20:00,642 --> 01:20:02,769
Your baby has something
to tell you.

1037
01:20:02,945 --> 01:20:04,913
Ethel, I mean, Miss Jackson

1038
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:08,607
it will take weeks
to restore harmony here.

1039
01:20:08,784 --> 01:20:12,550
I do not want to do anything
that the more disruptive.

1040
01:20:12,721 --> 01:20:14,018
Not now.

1041
01:20:14,189 --> 01:20:17,090
You measure the importance
it has for me.

1042
01:20:17,259 --> 01:20:18,624
I start, yes.

1043
01:20:18,794 --> 01:20:22,059
Give me some time
to arrange ...

1044
01:20:22,231 --> 01:20:24,392
- Ethel, wait ...
- Let her go.

1045
01:20:41,083 --> 01:20:42,380
Miss Jackson?

1046
01:20:47,289 --> 01:20:49,621
Welcome to the gay Paris.

1047
01:21:04,907 --> 01:21:07,535
So I'm not even married
this big beta.

1048
01:21:07,709 --> 01:21:11,941
I would have told you earlier,
but I did not before arrival.

1049
01:21:12,114 --> 01:21:13,240
Sam knows?

1050
01:21:13,415 --> 01:21:15,781
I left him a message to the hotel.

1051
01:21:16,818 --> 01:21:20,481
Married and divorced by servers.
This is a great career.

1052
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:24,520
My little Camille, do not be so tragic.

1053
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:26,718
Tragic? Me?

1054
01:21:26,895 --> 01:21:30,490
I'm brimming with joy to rid myself
this pretentious.

1055
01:21:30,666 --> 01:21:32,657
In fact, I celebrate the news.

1056
01:21:32,834 --> 01:21:34,199
Boy?

1057
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:37,170
Another drink.

1058
01:21:38,907 --> 01:21:40,067
Thank you.

1059
01:21:40,242 --> 01:21:42,233
Why not go inside?

1060
01:21:42,945 --> 01:21:44,708
Because it is April in Paris.

1061
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:48,338
When it's April in Paris
we sit all out.

1062
01:21:48,517 --> 01:21:50,815
Can I leave the bottle?

1063
01:21:50,986 --> 01:21:52,647
You come back?

1064
01:21:53,689 --> 01:21:55,020
In July.

1065
01:21:56,558 --> 01:21:59,789
I'll tell you:
Sat Putnam means nothing to me.

1066
01:21:59,962 --> 01:22:03,921
I came to Paris for fun
and that's what I'll do.

1067
01:22:07,202 --> 01:22:08,863
Do not be sarcastic.

1068
01:22:09,671 --> 01:22:11,434
Philippe, sing something.

1069
01:22:11,606 --> 01:22:14,200
Sing? I do not want to.

1070
01:22:14,376 --> 01:22:17,402
But in Paris
everybody wants to sing.

1071
01:22:17,579 --> 01:22:18,637
What a horrible idea.

1072
01:22:18,814 --> 01:22:21,282
Come, Philip,
be gay and careless.

1073
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:23,577
And Champs Elysees.

1074
01:22:23,752 --> 01:22:26,277
Okay, I'll try.

1075
01:22:28,957 --> 01:22:30,891
 April in Paris 

1076
01:22:32,728 --> 01:22:35,356
 chestnut flowers 

1077
01:22:36,465 --> 01:22:40,799
 output tables under the trees 

1078
01:22:42,738 --> 01:22:45,172
 April in Paris 

1079
01:22:46,208 --> 01:22:48,039
 It feels 

1080
01:22:49,177 --> 01:22:53,307
 What nobody could reproduce 

1081
01:22:55,717 --> 01:22:59,448
 I never knew 
The charm of spring  

1082
01:23:00,222 --> 01:23:02,782
'd never hit so close 

1083
01:23:04,026 --> 01:23:07,723
 I never knew 
 That my heart could sing 

1084
01:23:09,131 --> 01:23:12,828
 No warm embrace 
 had never missed 

1085
01:23:13,101 --> 01:23:17,561
 Until April in Paris 

1086
01:23:18,807 --> 01:23:21,503
 to turn to? 

1087
01:23:23,078 --> 01:23:25,546
 What did you make me 

1088
01:23:26,948 --> 01:23:30,076
 heart 

1089
01:23:42,064 --> 01:23:43,554
Useless, Philip.

1090
01:23:44,166 --> 01:23:47,829
Like the man I married
and who is not even my husband.

1091
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:51,496
Even in Paris, this is unusual.

1092
01:23:51,673 --> 01:23:55,803
What will I do?
I can crawl back to him.

1093
01:23:56,745 --> 01:23:59,441
Sure he will not return
crawling towards me.

1094
01:23:59,614 --> 01:24:02,583
You will not leave Paris without him.

1095
01:24:02,751 --> 01:24:04,116
I promise you.

1096
01:24:04,286 --> 01:24:09,121
With what I have up there
and what you have there,

1097
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:10,815
we find a way.

1098
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:10,349
Good night, darling.

1099
01:25:11,086 --> 01:25:12,280
You're not ready?

1100
01:25:12,454 --> 01:25:15,252
You better
to go to the tavern without me.

1101
01:25:15,423 --> 01:25:16,515
I have a headache.

1102
01:25:16,691 --> 01:25:19,489
But it's the best show in Paris.

1103
01:25:19,661 --> 01:25:21,424
We have a table first.

1104
01:25:21,596 --> 01:25:24,861
There is apparently a new
great American artist.

1105
01:25:28,303 --> 01:25:29,327
What's going on?

1106
01:25:29,504 --> 01:25:32,064
I do not want
you catch my migraine.

1107
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:34,606
I will not go if you feel well.

1108
01:25:35,177 --> 01:25:38,010
Lay down that I will ground the temples.

1109
01:25:39,814 --> 01:25:44,114
- I can get up to take an aspirin.
- But this is not the same thing.

1110
01:25:46,555 --> 01:25:50,889
- Get out. I feel better.
- While there is no reason to leave.

1111
01:25:55,597 --> 01:25:57,861
I will be ready in a gale.

1112
01:27:09,804 --> 01:27:11,066
Ethel.

1113
01:27:11,239 --> 01:27:14,572
- I'm distributed in New York.
- They had to refuse.

1114
01:27:14,743 --> 01:27:18,907
 So keep the Empire State 
 Who is great 

1115
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:20,672
 But that's all 

1116
01:27:21,483 --> 01:27:25,817
Take  therefore, your old New York 
I'm also going  

1117
01:27:25,987 --> 01:27:27,818
 Me, I want Paris 

1118
01:27:28,523 --> 01:27:31,048
 My New York may have its faults 

1119
01:27:31,226 --> 01:27:33,353
 As you say 

1120
01:27:34,162 --> 01:27:36,289
But your  Paris has also 

1121
01:27:36,698 --> 01:27:38,723
 Please, over here 

1122
01:27:47,509 --> 01:27:50,740
From your hotel  
 The view is beautiful 

1123
01:27:50,912 --> 01:27:54,143
 But the problem in the story 
 There is no bathtub 

1124
01:27:54,316 --> 01:27:56,807
The plumbing  date of 1883 

1125
01:27:56,985 --> 01:27:58,009
 I know 

1126
01:27:58,186 --> 01:28:00,916
 But therein lies the charm of Paris 

1127
01:28:01,089 --> 01:28:04,115
The clothes are chic  
 hats, unique 

1128
01:28:04,559 --> 01:28:07,790
What rapture  
 Then comes the note 

1129
01:28:07,962 --> 01:28:11,193
 And you end up penniless 

1130
01:28:12,033 --> 01:28:14,763
 Therein lies the charm of Paris 

1131

 We do not support 
 Not without love 

1140
01:28:31,986 --> 01:28:34,887
 I like love 
 But not always 

1141
01:28:35,357 --> 01:28:38,758
 I think it's heredity 

1142
01:28:39,527 --> 01:28:40,858
 As they say ...

1143
01:28:43,131 --> 01:28:45,429
 Therein lies the charm of Paris 

1144

 To have a taxi

 It can go

 Force me a little and it will 

1167
01:29:58,039 --> 01:30:00,303
 Paris begins to please me 

1168

 De Paris 

1176
01:30:39,113 --> 01:30:42,412
It was quite a spectacle
for at least one person.

1177
01:30:43,818 --> 01:30:46,412
I wonder what he has
between it and the French.

1178
01:30:46,588 --> 01:30:48,146
I gotta go find out.

1179
01:30:48,323 --> 01:30:52,419
No. You're going back to the hotel and forget it.

1180
01:30:52,594 --> 01:30:53,925
I can not forget.

1181
01:30:54,095 --> 01:30:57,155
Whenever I try,
I remember very clearly.

1182
01:30:57,332 --> 01:30:59,391
It might be easier
to forget.

1183
01:30:59,567 --> 01:31:00,761
Winthrop.

1184
01:31:01,202 --> 01:31:04,433
If you leave me,
it's the end of your career.

1185
01:31:04,606 --> 01:31:07,302
You will not be even
dog catcher.

1186
01:31:07,475 --> 01:31:08,567
It suits me perfectly.

1187
01:31:08,743 --> 01:31:10,904
I've picked up too.

1188
01:31:11,079 --> 01:31:12,103
You never loved me.

1189
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:15,545
You wanted to marry me
to redo the White House.

1190
01:31:15,717 --> 01:31:18,618
- Winthrop.
- I will tell Ethel that I love.

1191
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:25,623
- Dad, why did not you say?
- What could I say?

1192
01:31:25,793 --> 01:31:28,387
He pretty much covered it.

1193
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:37,130
It's yours.

1194
01:31:37,305 --> 01:31:40,001
I heard him gasp from the scene.

1195
01:31:40,174 --> 01:31:42,540
- You think he'll come back?
- Crawling.

1196
01:31:42,710 --> 01:31:44,371
Like a poodle.

1197
01:31:46,014 --> 01:31:47,447
He scratches at the door.

1198
01:31:47,615 --> 01:31:49,048
I do not want to see.

1199
01:31:49,217 --> 01:31:50,650
But he came back.

1200
01:31:50,818 --> 01:31:54,049
You love him, he loves you.
What's more?

1201
01:31:54,222 --> 01:31:56,690
He has not suffered enough, that's all.

1202
01:31:56,858 --> 01:31:57,984
Enter.

1203
01:32:00,995 --> 01:32:03,190
Ethel, I love you.

1204
01:32:03,364 --> 01:32:04,388
He loves you.

1205
01:32:04,566 --> 01:32:08,024
- Shut up, thief of women.
- Bravo. He is also jealous.

1206
01:32:08,202 --> 01:32:11,296
- Would you hit me? I'm despicable.
- After.

1207
01:32:11,472 --> 01:32:14,669
You're not my wife,
but I want you to be.

1208
01:32:14,842 --> 01:32:16,104
Mr. Putnam

1209
01:32:16,277 --> 01:32:20,008
I never trust to a promise
made on a whim.

1210
01:32:20,181 --> 01:32:23,673
- It would break your career is already over.
- I do not want.

1211
01:32:23,851 --> 01:32:25,648
- Shall we?
- Where?

1212
01:32:25,820 --> 01:32:27,378
Where we go every night.

1213
01:32:27,555 --> 01:32:30,683
He is embarrassed in front of men
honorable intentions.

1214
01:32:30,858 --> 01:32:32,655
We'll do the wedding.

1215
01:32:32,827 --> 01:32:34,886
- One minute.
- We'll dance until dawn.

1216
01:32:35,063 --> 01:32:38,362
And laugh, sing
drink champagne and endless.

1217
01:32:38,533 --> 01:32:41,058
Mr. Putnam then inform
State Department

1218
01:32:41,235 --> 01:32:44,534
that tonight I will have for my 200 dollars.

1219
01:32:47,575 --> 01:32:50,305
What do you want from me?
Sam is income to you.

1220
01:32:50,478 --> 01:32:53,675
You just need to pick
like a ripe peach.

1221
01:32:53,848 --> 01:32:56,043
It is not mature enough. He must suffer.

1222
01:32:56,217 --> 01:32:57,684
Ethel.

1223
01:33:00,355 --> 01:33:01,788
Suffer.

1224
01:33:18,573 --> 01:33:22,805
Hurry. Do not lose eye
this taxi. The girl I married is.

1225
01:33:22,977 --> 01:33:24,672
Fouquet has remade his own.

1226
01:33:35,056 --> 01:33:37,081
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Philip.

1227
01:33:37,258 --> 01:33:42,321
Bring the young lady to his hotel
at 94, rue Fauberge.

1228
01:33:43,998 --> 01:33:45,397
Thank you.

1229
01:34:05,386 --> 01:34:06,580
Guess who.

1230
01:34:07,755 --> 01:34:08,983
Si

1231
01:34:10,324 --> 01:34:12,554
Tuck, it's late.
The game is over.

1232
01:34:12,727 --> 01:34:14,752
Almost. He followed us.

1233
01:34:14,929 --> 01:34:17,830
- He saw you come in?
- That's what I wanted.

1234
01:34:18,499 --> 01:34:20,967
There are crazy in your family?

1235
01:34:21,135 --> 01:34:22,796
- No.
- Now, if.

1236
01:34:30,945 --> 01:34:32,435
They do not believe.

1237
01:34:32,613 --> 01:34:35,582
Me, Philippe Fouquet
I fight for my honor.

1238
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:37,980
Sat

1239
01:34:40,354 --> 01:34:41,378
Destroyer of homes.

1240
01:34:41,556 --> 01:34:43,683
In America, you hang him for that.

1241
01:34:43,858 --> 01:34:45,985
It was self-defense.

1242
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:48,993
- Species of gigolo.
- Sat

1243
01:34:49,163 --> 01:34:50,425
You really want me.

1244
01:34:50,598 --> 01:34:52,623
And you go back to the hotel with me.

1245
01:34:53,568 --> 01:34:55,661
Get up I knock you down again.

1246
01:34:55,837 --> 01:34:57,737
Explain to us ...

1247
01:34:57,905 --> 01:35:00,533
I stay on the floor as she does.

1248
01:35:00,942 --> 01:35:03,308
Philip. What happened?

1249
01:35:03,478 --> 01:35:04,570
What's the matter?

1250
01:35:04,746 --> 01:35:06,475
- What did they do?
- Nothing.

1251
01:35:06,647 --> 01:35:08,080
Who are you?

1252
01:35:08,249 --> 01:35:11,013
Miss Jackson, my wife, Madame Fouquet.

1253
01:35:11,185 --> 01:35:13,380
Married too.

1254
01:35:13,554 --> 01:35:16,819
In America, you wring the neck
after you have hung.

1255
01:35:16,991 --> 01:35:18,015
Why?

1256
01:35:18,192 --> 01:35:21,457
For trying to bring
an idiot to her man?

1257
01:35:21,629 --> 01:35:23,927
To have it thrown out of my house?

1258
01:35:24,098 --> 01:35:27,534
Almost every night
a fool follows him home.

1259
01:35:27,702 --> 01:35:29,670
It has become monotonous.

1260
01:35:31,038 --> 01:35:33,472
But nobody told me his wife.

1261
01:35:33,641 --> 01:35:35,905
In the eyes of all,
I'm his housekeeper.

1262
01:35:36,077 --> 01:35:38,238
Everyone should know in France

1263
01:35:38,412 --> 01:35:43,543
Philippe Fouquet
an old married man with five children.

1264
01:35:43,851 --> 01:35:48,254
- Five children.
- I am a very good housekeeper.

1265
01:35:48,422 --> 01:35:51,050
If it is known, it would be bad
for my business.

1266
01:35:51,225 --> 01:35:54,991
- And how he would feed his family?
- That's what I want to know.

1267
01:35:55,163 --> 01:35:59,122
Philippe Fouquet must play
the gay fellow, dancing, singing.

1268
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:01,598
A different woman every night.

1269
01:36:01,769 --> 01:36:04,101
And I always come home to my wife.

1270
01:36:04,672 --> 01:36:07,232
Tired, but he returned.

1271
01:36:07,775 --> 01:36:08,969
Merry Paris.

1272
01:36:09,143 --> 01:36:12,044
I will not believe anything about Paris
my whole life.

1273
01:36:12,213 --> 01:36:13,510
I do not believe this.

1274
01:36:13,681 --> 01:36:16,548
You can fool S. Winthrop Putnam
not Sat

1275
01:36:16,717 --> 01:36:18,082
I am a new man.

1276
01:36:18,252 --> 01:36:20,083
You'll wake the children.

1277
01:36:20,254 --> 01:36:22,222
If anything, I eat them all.

1278
01:36:22,390 --> 01:36:24,881
- On toast.
- Papa!

1279
01:36:28,663 --> 01:36:30,358
Or white bread?

1280
01:36:40,541 --> 01:36:44,568
Here's my good American friends,
miss Mr. Jackson and Putnam

1281
01:36:44,745 --> 01:36:46,940
who do not believe you exist.

1282
01:36:49,650 --> 01:36:51,550
Enough. Go to bed.

1283
01:36:51,719 --> 01:36:54,916
- Charles, Yvonne.
- She is right. I accompany you.

1284
01:36:56,624 --> 01:36:59,286
This is my career.

1285
01:37:00,061 --> 01:37:01,323
Good night.

1286
01:37:13,841 --> 01:37:14,967
So?

1287
01:37:15,142 --> 01:37:19,169
All this proves that you flirts
with a married man.

1288
01:37:19,747 --> 01:37:22,045
It proves nothing of the sort.

1289
01:37:24,919 --> 01:37:26,716
How could I know?

1290
01:37:26,888 --> 01:37:28,150
It is a state secret.

1291
01:37:28,322 --> 01:37:31,223
Then you cook something up
with a man who was not.

1292
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:35,021
- I did not know his children.
- If it were 5 women do not matter.

1293
01:37:35,196 --> 01:37:38,632
I pray you, go home.

1294
01:37:38,799 --> 01:37:43,463
Kiss you, marry you,
do something you go to bed.

1295
01:37:43,638 --> 01:37:45,299
I married once is enough.

1296
01:37:45,473 --> 01:37:48,442
How to convince
poached egg that I like?

1297
01:37:48,609 --> 01:37:51,737
- Love is for peasants.
- So I am one.

1298
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:55,008
Philippe, love is not it wonderful?

1299
01:37:55,182 --> 01:37:56,342
It is I who am asking you.

1300
01:37:56,517 --> 01:37:57,779
Love?

1301
01:37:57,952 --> 01:38:00,284
Love is beautiful, I tell you.

1302
01:38:00,688 --> 01:38:04,681
 Ask anyone in Paris 
 He will tell you yes 

1303
01:38:04,859 --> 01:38:06,087
 Not for me 

1304
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:08,023
 It's so nice 

1305
01:38:08,195 --> 01:38:09,219
 I hate 

1306
01:38:09,397 --> 01:38:10,887
 For boys and girls 

1307
01:38:11,065 --> 01:38:12,089
 Overrated 

1308
01:38:12,266 --> 01:38:14,063
 Love is happiness 

1309
01:38:14,235 --> 01:38:15,395
 pure idiocy 

1310
01:38:15,569 --> 01:38:16,661
 is you, the idiot 

1311
01:38:16,837 --> 01:38:19,567
 Stop being an idiot and kiss me 

1312
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:21,105
 She's right, stubborn 

1313
01:38:21,275 --> 01:38:22,503
 Stay out of it 

1314
01:38:22,677 --> 01:38:24,668
 It's my fault, not hers 

1315
01:38:24,845 --> 01:38:27,279
 is fine 
 Can I go? 

1316
01:38:27,448 --> 01:38:29,177
If I can monitor  

1317
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:32,080
It's so sad  
 is scary 

1318
01:38:32,253 --> 01:38:34,847
 She is adorable 
He is contemptuous  

1319
01:38:35,022 --> 01:38:38,116
 they arrange it for themselves 

1320
01:38:38,292 --> 01:38:39,953
Philip?

1321
01:38:40,127 --> 01:38:44,427
 Goodbye, my friends 
 I have problems on my side 

1322
01:38:47,635 --> 01:38:49,296
 You've 

1323
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:50,767
 is wrong 

1324
01:38:50,938 --> 01:38:52,166
 is you who I am 

1325
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:53,568
Who  follows that 

1326
01:38:53,741 --> 01:38:55,038
 Let us all 

1327
01:38:55,209 --> 01:38:58,406
 embrace us and we say farewell 

1328
01:38:58,579 --> 01:39:00,012
 Farewell forever 

1329
01:39:00,181 --> 01:39:01,512
 Please 

1330
01:39:01,682 --> 01:39:04,310
 Love is not it wonderful? 

1331
01:39:05,186 --> 01:39:06,585
 I ask 

1332
01:39:06,754 --> 01:39:09,348
 Is not it wonderful? 

1333
01:39:09,957 --> 01:39:12,118
 I ask 

1334
01:39:22,770 --> 01:39:28,709
 I do not know 
 That my heart could sing 

1335
01:39:28,876 --> 01:39:35,076
 No warm embrace 
 had never missed 

1336
01:39:40,254 --> 01:39:42,586
Is not it beautiful?

1337
01:39:42,757 --> 01:39:44,622
What a beautiful plant.

1338
01:40:02,910 --> 01:40:04,901
