How're you doing?

4
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:11,085
I said heeeey-o!

5
00:00:24,729 --> 00:00:27,798
There's people that like
to do things the safe way.

6
00:00:27,799 --> 00:00:32,006
And that's just never been
part of my vocabulary.

00:01:04,102 --> 00:01:08,507
But I never thought I'd end up,

Billie Joe's a punk

18
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:32,062
working class kid.

- Tickets.
- It's just me.

20
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:36,467
I'm from Rockville, Maryland,

21
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:40,839
upper middle class family and theatre geek.

22
00:01:45,075 --> 00:01:46,810
We have nothing in common.

23
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:49,880
There's absolutely no reason
why this should work.

24
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:53,951
Again, you can be as
cocky as you want to be.

25
00:01:53,952 --> 00:01:56,253
Broadway is such a foreign thing to me,

26
00:01:56,254 --> 00:01:57,988
Stairway to your right, please.

27
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:00,324
This is crazy.

28
00:02:00,325 --> 00:02:02,459
Tonight Billie Joe Armstrong

29
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,696
will be making his
professional theatre debut,

30
00:02:05,697 --> 00:02:08,332
and his Broadway debut at one time.

31
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,632
Fucktime!

32
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:12,303
The role of Saint Jimmy,
usually played by Tony Vincent,

33
00:02:12,304 --> 00:02:14,839
will be played by Billie Joe Armstrong.

34
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:23,147
I can't act, I can't dance.

35
00:02:23,148 --> 00:02:25,348
Compared to a lot of these people,
I can't even sing.

36
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:26,349
Come on!

37
00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:31,055
I was thinking to myself,

38
00:02:31,056 --> 00:02:33,824
"What the fuck are you doing here?"

39
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:44,134

41
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:54,078
American Idiot, the album,
exploded on the scene

42
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,814
in those really hideous post 9/11 years.

43

<i>♪ The subliminal mindfuck America ♪</i>

44
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:05,257

<i>♪ Everything isn't meant to be okay ♪</i>

46
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,865
As a band we really wanted to make

47
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:16,299
some kind of concept record.

48
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,936
Drawing from like Tommy to Sergeant Pepper.

49
00:03:19,937 --> 00:03:21,806
England!

50
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:24,475
Mike Dirnt kind of started it off,

51
00:03:24,476 --> 00:03:26,210
and then we all just sort of joined in,

52
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:28,211
and we were all like,
"this could be really great."

<i>♪ Well maybe I'm the faggot America ♪</i>

54
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,251
To me, bringing American Idiot to Broadway

55
00:03:34,252 --> 00:03:36,553
seemed like a really great idea.

56

But, you know,
I mean this album's, it's my baby.

60
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:50,834

I never put so much emotion into any record

69
00:04:36,714 --> 00:04:40,751
like I have into every song
that's on American Idiot.

70

<i>♪ Summer has come and passed ♪</i>

71
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:47,323
There are times where I
feel like I get choked up

72
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:50,326
and I feel like it's hard to
sing the next line

73
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:53,162
because everything comes from
some emotional place

74
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:56,333
that i've experienced in my life

75
00:04:56,334 --> 00:05:00,037
and it resurfaces every time
that I play those songs.

76
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:04,540

79
00:05:16,187 --> 00:05:17,987
It was the first time

80
00:05:17,988 --> 00:05:21,258
I ever wrote about like my father dying.

81
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:23,761
So when I moved out I was 17,

82
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:25,528
you know, I started living in warehouses.

83
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:27,664
My dad died when I was 10,
so I said seven years

84
00:05:27,665 --> 00:05:30,032
- as if it was seven years later.
- Right.

85
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:34,171
And then you go to, um,
at the end, at the last verse,

86
00:05:34,172 --> 00:05:35,838
- it says 20 years.
- Right.

87
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,975
So it's an adult reminiscing
about being a young adult.

91
00:05:54,492 --> 00:05:56,760
And it just happened to be September?

92
00:05:56,761 --> 00:05:57,828
Is that when it was?

93
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:01,364
Yeah, well he passed away in September,

94
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:04,667
and it's like the whole thing
is kind of like that,

95
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:10,239
it's like the worst month of the year,
you know.

96
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,244
I mean for some weird reason,
some strange like coincidence,

97
00:06:14,245 --> 00:06:17,481
I mean whether it's like
my parent dying or...

98
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:21,184
To me it was all-it was a
9/11 kind of thing.

99
00:06:21,185 --> 00:06:23,389
That's what resonated for me.

100
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:25,523
Here's the deal...

101
00:06:25,524 --> 00:06:28,258
When we started
really kicking around this idea,

102
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,662
we did not know if Green Day
would give us permission

103
00:06:32,663 --> 00:06:34,266
to do the production.

104
00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:37,434
My heart was in my throat
a little bit because I thought,

105
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:39,939
"what if this doesn't work for them?"

106
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:43,306
When people think of Broadway,

107
00:06:43,307 --> 00:06:48,044
they think of everyone's singing
and dancing and life is swell,

108
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:50,547
and you know,
the Rockettes or something like that.

109
00:06:50,548 --> 00:06:53,484
What we're gonna try and do today
is map out the harder stuff.

110
00:06:53,485 --> 00:06:56,820
My fear was that it was just
gonna be sort of absurd,

111
00:06:56,821 --> 00:06:59,823
and not relatable and corny.

At the start of the show

117
00:07:13,303 --> 00:07:15,939
I lead my friends into this catharsis of

118
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,808
"there's gotta be something else out there.

119
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:20,443

00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:30,254

124
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:42,131
American Idiot...

125
00:07:42,132 --> 00:07:45,771
I would say 90 percent is
sort of based on my life.

126
00:07:46,771 --> 00:07:49,138
I just wanted to get the
hell out of my town.

127
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:53,075
I wanted to leave with reckless abandon.

128
00:07:53,076 --> 00:07:54,443
I didn't car where I ended up,

129
00:07:54,444 --> 00:07:57,847
as long as I saw as much
as humanly possible.

130
00:07:57,848 --> 00:08:00,322
And it had nothing to do
with where I came from.

131
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,653
That's what I was looking for.

135

And then break,
and we'll just figure out who calls that,

136
00:08:25,142 --> 00:08:26,475
and who makes the break.

137
00:08:26,476 --> 00:08:29,446
In terms of the way
that we plan to tell our story

138
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:32,152
in American Idiot,
the closest thing would be opera.

139
00:08:34,152 --> 00:08:36,052
In opera, you're telling your story

140
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:39,790
through the physical actions
and character behavior

141
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,825
that accompanies the singing.

142
00:08:41,826 --> 00:08:43,694
This is the dawning of
the rest of our lives.

143
00:08:43,695 --> 00:08:47,064
You're in the city now,
so it's like this massive exultation

that you've finally arrived here.

145
00:08:48,432 --> 00:08:50,200
So sing the sh-out of it

146
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:53,504

just be like wild and mad.

00:09:54,932 --> 00:09:59,638
We started Green Day
when I was about 15 years old.

160
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:04,441
Coming from Berkeley we were always
exposed to different politics

161
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:06,677
where people were really confrontational.

162
00:10:06,678 --> 00:10:09,211
So around 2003,

163
00:10:09,212 --> 00:10:11,148
because of what was happening
in the administration

164
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:13,617
what was going on in the war in Iraq,

165
00:10:13,618 --> 00:10:16,655
we started to take more
of a personal stance.

166
00:10:18,655 --> 00:10:21,490
I remember going on this walk
and then thinking,

167
00:10:21,491 --> 00:10:24,427
"I'm the son of rage and love,
the Jesus of Suburbia".

168
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:26,729
Those two lines right there for me were,

169
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,634
"Oh my God, here we go".

170
00:10:32,602 --> 00:10:35,705
Those two lines came out
and they excited me

171
00:10:35,706 --> 00:10:38,542
and scared the living piss
out of me at the same time.

172
00:10:38,543 --> 00:10:44,414
<i>♪ Rage and love, the story of my life ♪</i>

173

175
00:10:57,562 --> 00:11:00,629
I remember cranking that record
as loud as it would go,

176
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,600
and really just feeling understood.

177
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:08,705
For me,
coming of age in post 9/11 United States,

178
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:13,844
there was this sense of
sadness and disillusionment.

179
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:17,047

187
00:11:36,134 --> 00:11:38,667
If you really take the time
to sit with the lyrics,

188
00:11:38,668 --> 00:11:40,903
they are wonderfully poetic.

189
00:11:40,904 --> 00:11:43,008
I am the king of fuckdom!

190
00:11:44,008 --> 00:11:46,877
Billie is writing about
the world of suburbia

191
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:49,479
and convenience stores,
and those things that you grew up with

192
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,947
that you hate so much.

193
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:57,354
I've never seen a
cast connect to their characters

194
00:11:57,355 --> 00:11:59,725
in such a profound way.

195
00:12:00,725 --> 00:12:05,096
These characters are sort of us,
extensions of us.

196
00:12:06,612 --> 00:12:08,665
I've gone through those periods of time

197
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,935
where I've just felt this desperate longing

198
00:12:11,936 --> 00:12:14,937
to get out into a bigger world than this.

199
00:12:14,938 --> 00:12:16,273
You just feel like, you know,

200
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:19,143
you're just sinking in to quicksand.

201
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,680
<i>♪ To fall in love and fall in debt ♪</i>

209
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:47,870
Whether it has to
do with romance or politics,

210
00:12:47,871 --> 00:12:49,819
I'm just trying to figure things out.

211
00:12:51,107 --> 00:12:55,644
A theme of mine, is just,
you know, sort of just being...

212
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:59,616
you know, lost in chaos.

213
00:13:12,596 --> 00:13:14,064
When I came on board,

214
00:13:14,065 --> 00:13:16,766
the question was how do we
take this iconic album,

215
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:19,702
that primarily is sung by one person,

216
00:13:19,703 --> 00:13:22,973
and create characters and stories

217
00:13:22,974 --> 00:13:25,643
for a number of different people.

218
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,514
So after the...

219
00:13:32,515 --> 00:13:40,224
<i>♪ With every breath that I
am worth here on Earth... ♪</i>

220
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:43,461
I love your falsetto.

221
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:47,096
Me and Barry Gibb.

222
00:13:47,097 --> 00:13:48,931
For example the song "Last Night on Earth"

223
00:13:48,932 --> 00:13:49,972
is going to be this moment

224
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,369
where Johnny and Whatsername

225
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:57,641
are shooting up on drugs
in a very romantic way.

226
00:13:57,642 --> 00:14:00,576
So, already the image of
romantically getting high...

227
00:14:00,577 --> 00:14:03,683
was in my head, and I thought,
"Well how can we make this...

228
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:09,720
...how can we make this
a trippy love ballad?"

229
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:17,127
And I was on the train one day
and I started thinking about it,

230
00:14:17,128 --> 00:14:18,497
and then I just thought...

231
00:14:20,096 --> 00:14:24,701
...how about a wall of sound,
beautiful vocal arrangement,

232
00:14:24,702 --> 00:14:27,303
kind of in the style of the Beach Boys,

233
00:14:27,304 --> 00:14:29,806
these beautiful falsetto harmonies,

234
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:31,176
just raining down on them.

235
00:14:34,711 --> 00:14:38,848
<i>♪ I text a postcard sent to you ♪</i>

236
00:14:38,849 --> 00:14:41,718
And I remember saying to Michael, I said,

237
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:45,388
"This is kind of crazy and it's going
to take a while for them to learn,

238
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:49,191
but I promise you, if it sounds anything
like my head, it's going to be worth it".

239
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:51,226
You take turns singing, right?

240
00:14:51,227 --> 00:14:55,231
We put the stuff together and
today we have to show Green Day.

241
00:14:59,803 --> 00:15:03,206
Baritones, you guys can really
ease up on the volume there.

242
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:11,316
<i>♪ I walked for miles 'til I found you ♪</i>

243
00:15:12,316 --> 00:15:13,782
With "Last Night on Earth"

244
00:15:13,783 --> 00:15:16,518
they won't know
what song it is when we start.

245
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:19,723
It doesn't have any of the signature chords

246
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:21,625
or instrumentation.

247
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,228
So when Declan starts singing,

248
00:15:25,229 --> 00:15:31,033
<i>♪ I text a postcard sent to you,
did it go through ♪</i>

249
00:15:31,034 --> 00:15:34,350
I think they are going to be like,
"Oh my god, that's the song".

250
00:15:35,005 --> 00:15:36,706
Hey, Michael?

251
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:42,979
We have to get the go-ahead from Green Day

252
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,782
or the show is over.

253
00:15:45,783 --> 00:15:49,254
They're one of the biggest
rock bands on the planet.

254
00:15:49,854 --> 00:15:52,122
They're not gonna sign
a piece of paper that says,

255
00:15:52,123 --> 00:15:53,355
"Oh yeah, you know,

256
00:15:53,356 --> 00:15:56,926
you seem like a good guy
and I liked your play.

257
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:00,196
So here, go do whatever you want."

258
00:16:00,197 --> 00:16:01,931
They need to make sure

259
00:16:01,932 --> 00:16:04,143
it's something they can really get behind.

260
00:16:05,135 --> 00:16:08,238
Whoo!

261
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:10,875
This one, um, this is a...

262
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,976
you'll know this song when you hear it.

263
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:15,211

277

278
00:18:05,522 --> 00:18:07,891
That was incredible, that was so good.

279
00:18:07,892 --> 00:18:10,012
I was sitting next to Billie
Joe and I was so nervous.

280
00:18:10,027 --> 00:18:12,729
And at the end of it he just
grabbed my leg and squeezed,

281
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,097
and told me how beautiful
he thought it was, so...

282
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:17,933
I was happy on two fronts.
We're telling our story,

283
00:18:17,934 --> 00:18:21,237
and as importantly, the band is happy.

284
00:18:21,238 --> 00:18:23,373
Man, I mean that's like...

285
00:18:23,374 --> 00:18:26,976
you know I was just-I was floored.

286
00:18:26,977 --> 00:18:29,312
As soon as I was able to hear it that way,

287
00:18:29,313 --> 00:18:31,681
I was completely into it.

288
00:18:31,682 --> 00:18:34,183
I could visualize it.
I was like, "Oh, this can work".

289
00:18:34,184 --> 00:18:35,985
I didn't wanna, like, do it without-

290
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:38,254
Yeah, play with it and then, you know-

291
00:18:38,255 --> 00:18:40,456
I kind of do it like how
I did on the record,

292
00:18:40,457 --> 00:18:42,624
which has nothing to do with

293
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,059
the way you guys are
gonna do it whatsoever,

294
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,261
but, I mean, that'd be cool.

295
00:18:46,262 --> 00:18:50,833
The band not only gave us
permission to do the show,

296
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:55,137
they've encouraged us
with great enthusiasm,

297
00:18:55,138 --> 00:18:59,174
and with a kind of appetite

298
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:02,579

321
00:21:17,413 --> 00:21:20,982
You're just trying to create
a vessel for this...

322
00:21:20,983 --> 00:21:23,585
this event to happen inside of.

323
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:29,225
And to create as much potential
for all kinds of action to happen,

324
00:21:29,226 --> 00:21:32,563
whether it's the video action
or physical action.

325
00:21:35,098 --> 00:21:37,499
So I made a very large room,

326
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,076
which ultimately became
a room of 40 foot walls.

327
00:21:46,076 --> 00:21:48,044
The scene shop has layered in

328
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:50,515
all the things that we printed digitally,

329
00:21:51,515 --> 00:21:53,883
And now that we're here in the space,

330
00:21:53,884 --> 00:21:57,353
what I want to try to do is
make it feel like a real place.

331
00:21:57,354 --> 00:21:59,555
And I always like to say,
like giving it its soul.

332
00:21:59,556 --> 00:22:05,563
This one is like Will's room so this
is going to get like full of CDs...

333
00:22:06,352 --> 00:22:07,563
What I'm starting to do

334
00:22:07,564 --> 00:22:09,364
is to put things in the nooks and crannies

335
00:22:09,365 --> 00:22:12,268
where the actors will kind of
see them as they're living here.

336
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:14,370
Things that the audience will never see,

337
00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:16,305
but the actors will kind of discover

338
00:22:16,306 --> 00:22:18,374
as they're here and working.

339
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:22,245
Alright so, um,
now why don't we move this square...

340
00:22:22,246 --> 00:22:27,717
We have a team of designers who
are all after the same vision.

341
00:22:27,718 --> 00:22:30,688
- They look too clean?
- Yeah, just a little clean.

342
00:22:31,688 --> 00:22:37,429
The challenge is to create an
image of chaos on stage.

343
00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:40,230
It's like writing a simple song.

344
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,367
You know, "Eleanor Rigby"
is a simple song...

345
00:22:45,368 --> 00:22:48,136
but it doesn't mean that you
can fucking do it. You know.

346
00:22:48,137 --> 00:22:49,905
There's... you know,

347
00:22:49,906 --> 00:22:53,342
and what Christine Jones does with the set

348
00:22:53,343 --> 00:22:54,743
is almost the same thing.

349
00:22:54,744 --> 00:22:58,314
It's able to go-take you
to all these different places,

350
00:22:58,315 --> 00:23:01,317
but what you're looking at is
a warehouse full of flyers.

351
00:23:19,736 --> 00:23:22,338
We'll do this one for time
from the same place.

352
00:23:26,242 --> 00:23:28,710
<i>♪ I walk this empty street ♪</i>

353
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:32,280

00:23:32,281 --> 00:23:34,650

<i>♪ And i'm the only one

356
00:23:38,355 --> 00:23:41,156
American Idiot is based on my life

357
00:23:41,157 --> 00:23:43,092
and old friendships.

358
00:23:43,093 --> 00:23:46,162
The story's all about the character,
Jesus of Suburbia,

359
00:23:46,163 --> 00:23:49,899
wanting to figure things out
and step up and-and-

360
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,216
you know, stand for
something he believes in.

361
00:23:53,103 --> 00:23:56,338
It's about learning the hard lessons.

362
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:02,345
<i>♪ Sometimes I wish
someone out there will find me ♪</i>

<i>♪ 'Til then I walk alone ♪</i>

364
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:11,687
If you study musicals,
they talk to you about "I want" songs.

365
00:24:11,688 --> 00:24:13,154
That song at the top of the show

366
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:16,325
where a character expresses
their wants for the evening.

367
00:24:16,326 --> 00:24:18,260
So in terms of this,

368
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:20,262
I wanted to think about,
well, where is that moment?

369
00:24:20,263 --> 00:24:23,932
<i>♪ I want adventure in the
great wide somewhere ♪</i>

370
00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:27,702
<i>♪ I want it more than I can say ♪</i>

371
00:24:27,703 --> 00:24:30,672
"Boulevard of Broken Dreams"
is kind of Johnny's "I want" song

372
00:24:30,673 --> 00:24:32,374
we get into his character.

373
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:35,778
<i>♪ I'm walking down the line ♪</i>

374
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:39,281
<i>♪ that divides me somewhere in my mind ♪</i>

375
00:24:39,282 --> 00:24:41,683
<i>♪ On the borderline ♪</i>

376
00:24:41,684 --> 00:24:45,556
<i>♪ of the edge and where I walk alone ♪</i>

377
00:24:48,158 --> 00:24:51,460
Your face should be out for the
"I" but it could be right on it.

378
00:24:51,461 --> 00:24:53,563
I, you know, okay cool.

379
00:24:53,564 --> 00:24:56,332
i play a character called Whatsername.

380
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:58,668
And um...

381
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:04,273
Whatsername is a woman who Johnny
meets when he's in the city.

382
00:25:07,844 --> 00:25:11,948
They have an immediate,
exciting and sparky energy

383
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:13,349
with each other.

384
00:25:19,355 --> 00:25:20,355
Okay, hold.

385
00:25:21,301 --> 00:25:22,459
That's good, isn't it?

386
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,893
Johnny primarily sings
"Boulevard of Broken Dreams",

387
00:25:24,894 --> 00:25:28,331
but we found a way to bring
Whatsername into that song

388
00:25:28,332 --> 00:25:30,533
so we establish the romance at that point.

389
00:25:30,534 --> 00:25:32,102
Awesome, thank you.

390
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,939
<i>♪ I walk alone I walk alone ♪</i>

391
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,307
There's this beautiful melodic line

392
00:25:39,308 --> 00:25:41,911
that the guitars play in the turn around

393
00:25:41,912 --> 00:25:43,912
between chorus and verse.

394
00:25:43,913 --> 00:25:47,682
It's the da nun da nun da nun daaa nun

395
00:25:47,683 --> 00:25:49,285
which I find so evocative,

396
00:25:49,286 --> 00:25:52,287
and I actually took that and
I put it in the strings

397
00:25:52,288 --> 00:25:54,089
at the beginning of the song,

398
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,325
because I wanted to
really set up that motif

399
00:25:56,326 --> 00:26:00,363
because later on she sings it
in the last chorus.

400
00:26:00,364 --> 00:26:05,735
<i>♪ Sometimes I wish

401
00:26:05,736 --> 00:26:10,139
So we feel their worlds
intertwine a little bit.

00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,577

408
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,882
Did it feel a hair too fast just now?

409
00:26:52,883 --> 00:26:55,116
Carmel, are you clicked on that?

410
00:26:55,117 --> 00:26:56,285
Yes.

411
00:26:56,286 --> 00:26:58,554
We can bring the tempo back if you want,
a little bit.

412
00:26:58,555 --> 00:26:59,654
Maybe like 2?

413
00:26:59,655 --> 00:27:01,556
What are you clocked at?

414
00:27:01,557 --> 00:27:02,725
159.

415
00:27:02,726 --> 00:27:04,327
Ca we try 157?

416
00:27:05,327 --> 00:27:08,163
<i>♪ She's a rebel, she's a saint ♪</i>

419
00:27:13,904 --> 00:27:17,573
So this is what it's supposed to be,
and I think it's really good.

420

some form of community.

425
00:27:38,062 --> 00:27:40,062
So if we could just do that each time.

426
00:27:40,063 --> 00:27:43,199
To have that in the rock world is rare.

427
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,581
Same power strokes but just
doing all downstrokes?

428
00:27:44,781 --> 00:27:46,302
Oh, okay, yeah,

431
00:27:52,275 --> 00:27:54,977
I've just kind of seen that
world for the first time.

432
00:27:54,978 --> 00:27:56,979
It's terrifying.
It is weird, man.

433
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,914
Billie Joe is so famous
and he is so careful

434
00:27:59,915 --> 00:28:02,951
to protect his family from so many people

435
00:28:02,952 --> 00:28:04,653
who want a piece of him...

436
00:28:04,654 --> 00:28:06,188
I'm lucky to have a cellphone right now.

437
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:08,891
...that he's really carved
out a very private life

438
00:28:08,892 --> 00:28:10,925
for himself and his family.

439
00:28:10,926 --> 00:28:15,264
And you can't have that
and be involved in a show.

440
00:28:15,265 --> 00:28:17,098
The minute you're in a show,

441
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:19,669
you are part of that extended family,

442
00:28:20,703 --> 00:28:24,940
for good or bad. For both, right?

443
00:28:24,941 --> 00:28:27,143
- Billie, is that right?
- He's right.

444
00:28:27,144 --> 00:28:28,912
Bon appetite.

445
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:37,353
I haven't experienced that sort
of camaraderie with-you know-

446
00:28:37,354 --> 00:28:41,958
with people and making friends
like that in a long time.

447
00:28:42,893 --> 00:28:44,927
Everyone was on the same level.

448
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,228
Like, there was one night,

449
00:28:46,229 --> 00:28:48,430
people started picking
things up and jamming,

450
00:28:48,431 --> 00:28:50,695
and then all of a sudden
we started playing.

451
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:54,737
And then Adrienne had the photo booth also.

452
00:28:54,738 --> 00:28:56,271
And so there was bonding going on...

453
00:28:56,272 --> 00:28:58,536
pretty wild bonding going on in that booth.

454
00:29:01,178 --> 00:29:03,746
I think it just grew from there.

455

458
00:29:14,891 --> 00:29:17,927
Any audience normally observe only
a quarter of the playing space,

459
00:29:17,928 --> 00:29:19,728
and there's three quarters from their heads

460
00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:21,497
that go up to the top.

461
00:29:21,498 --> 00:29:23,766
I wanted to make sure that
was part of our playing space

462
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:25,300
and not to kind of rule that area out.

463
00:29:25,301 --> 00:29:27,971
Pop back is on the two of that fourth bar.

466
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,748
I thought it was going to be easier.

467
00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:42,351
I was like, "Oh, I can do this.
This is easy, this is nothing."

468
00:29:42,352 --> 00:29:45,054
But... I don't know.

469
00:29:45,055 --> 00:29:48,959
<i>♪ From the one called Whatsername ♪</i>

470
00:29:51,361 --> 00:29:53,729
<i>♪ She's all alone again ♪</i>

471
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:57,132
It's difficult because
not only am I flying,

472
00:29:57,133 --> 00:29:58,299
but i'm also singing.

473
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,836
<i>♪ Some days he feels like dying ♪</i>

474
00:30:01,837 --> 00:30:06,275
But it's my job to show comfort
so we can deliver the story.

475
00:30:06,276 --> 00:30:09,711
Because it's not about the flying,
it's about the story.

476
00:30:09,712 --> 00:30:14,317
<i>♪ She's an extraordinary girl ♪</i>

477
00:30:18,721 --> 00:30:21,923
Because all of the material
has already been written

478
00:30:21,924 --> 00:30:23,726
and is being sung,

479
00:30:23,727 --> 00:30:25,928
we can't really change what they're saying.

480
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:27,429
Johnny's walking through New York...

481
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:32,534
So we had to figure out
how to plot out a real story

482
00:30:32,535 --> 00:30:35,738
and make them three dimensional characters.

483
00:30:35,739 --> 00:30:39,107
Johnny is the vulnerable one that gets...

484
00:30:39,108 --> 00:30:40,776
never had a family.

485
00:30:40,777 --> 00:30:44,512
Michael Mayer saw something in what I do

486
00:30:44,513 --> 00:30:47,682
that no one has ever really
been able to make sense of.

487
00:30:47,683 --> 00:30:48,784
Not in the rock world.

488
00:30:48,785 --> 00:30:51,653
Whatsername...
I always wish Whatsername had a name.

489
00:30:51,654 --> 00:30:53,655
And so I just trusted him.

490
00:30:53,656 --> 00:30:56,692
I knew what he was doing was-was cool.

491
00:31:01,897 --> 00:31:03,866
5, 6, 7, go, 1...

492
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:15,510
We kept working to make the story clear

493
00:31:15,511 --> 00:31:17,717
through the choreography.

494
00:31:20,717 --> 00:31:22,554
Soft.

495
00:31:24,554 --> 00:31:26,287
Steven had an idea

496
00:31:26,288 --> 00:31:29,490
that the chorus in "When September Ends"

497
00:31:29,491 --> 00:31:35,264
would do a kind of ballistic
searching for slumber

498
00:31:35,265 --> 00:31:37,365
almost under the stage floor,

499
00:31:37,366 --> 00:31:39,169
and it was thrilling to watch.

500
00:31:43,673 --> 00:31:48,445
<i>♪ 20 years has gone so fast ♪</i>

501
00:31:49,445 --> 00:31:51,079
But when we put it all together

502
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,384
it became very clear that it
was almost too much.

503
00:31:55,384 --> 00:31:58,354
And it was taking away from
the simplicity of the story

504
00:31:58,355 --> 00:31:59,722
of these three guys.

505
00:32:02,358 --> 00:32:05,760
Yeah, I think I wanted to put
all the whistles and bells on it,

506
00:32:05,761 --> 00:32:07,563
and actually when we
watched the whole thing

507
00:32:07,564 --> 00:32:11,232
there's literally a moment
that described everything.

508
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:12,968
And as long as we held on to that moment,

509
00:32:12,969 --> 00:32:16,337
right in front of us,
the nugget of the sequence,

510
00:32:16,338 --> 00:32:19,174
everything else was able to fall away.

511
00:32:45,435 --> 00:32:46,934
We've ended up with a version

512
00:32:46,935 --> 00:32:49,037
that's got more stillness
than anything else,

513
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:51,512
which is the last thing
I thought it would have.

514
00:32:51,907 --> 00:32:54,610
But working on it over the-over the weeks

515
00:32:54,611 --> 00:32:56,445
and then looking at the whole show...

516
00:32:56,645 --> 00:32:58,614
it's one of the pieces
that I'm most excited about.

517

When you're doing a new show,

526
00:33:25,607 --> 00:33:29,044
it's really important that you
try it out somewhere

527
00:33:29,045 --> 00:33:30,711
before you bring it to New York.

528
00:33:30,712 --> 00:33:32,480
Who do you have coming tonight?

529
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:36,751
I got my mom, and my sister...

530
00:33:36,752 --> 00:33:39,354
What you wanna do is give
yourself an opportunity

531
00:33:39,355 --> 00:33:42,857
to put a show on its feet
with full production values

532
00:33:42,858 --> 00:33:44,127
and learn what you can.

533
00:33:45,127 --> 00:33:46,233
Put your damn top on!

534
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:49,730
You want to make sure it's
the cast that you want.

535
00:33:49,731 --> 00:33:51,933
You wanna work the kinks out.

536
00:33:51,934 --> 00:33:53,335
Oh shit my nails aren't dry!

537
00:33:53,336 --> 00:33:55,863
And you wanna try it out in
front of an audience.

538
00:33:58,842 --> 00:34:00,608
I usually am angry

539
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:02,477
when the audience comes for the first time.

540
00:34:02,478 --> 00:34:04,413
I'm like, you know,
I've been having a great time

541
00:34:04,414 --> 00:34:05,580
here in rehearsal,

542
00:34:05,581 --> 00:34:07,883
and now you're going to come
with all your opinions...

543
00:34:07,884 --> 00:34:10,051
so I'm like, "fuck, the
audience is coming."

544
00:34:10,052 --> 00:34:13,455
Sound bright!
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

545
00:34:13,456 --> 00:34:15,323
But I don't feel that way at all.

546
00:34:15,324 --> 00:34:18,493
I just can't wait to, like,
just to get them there

547
00:34:18,494 --> 00:34:20,898
and like, see what happens.

548
00:34:22,498 --> 00:34:24,299
You know what?
I have no idea what's going to happen

549
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,834
or what it's going to be like.

550
00:34:26,034 --> 00:34:30,305
and so that's incredibly-
that's incredibly thrilling.

551
00:34:30,306 --> 00:34:34,878
So just like, bring it.
Come on, fuckers. What?

00:34:58,268 --> 00:35:03,404
the story that we had was 3
guys in a shitty little suburb

decide that they're going to get out.

Will's girlfriend is pregnant...

00:37:15,038 --> 00:37:17,074
whether it's through drugs or sex.

594
00:37:18,074 --> 00:37:20,042
When Johnny meets Whatsername,

595
00:37:20,043 --> 00:37:22,307
their relationship is just wild and sexual.

But then Saint Jimmy starts
to ruin him through drugs.

600
00:37:45,034 --> 00:37:47,868
Meanwhile,
Tunny has gone down to Times Square

601
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:48,904

and he loses a leg in battle.

605
00:38:06,422 --> 00:38:09,758
Michael really
stuck to the heart of the album

606
00:38:09,759 --> 00:38:12,295
and then he created new characters.

607
00:38:13,295 --> 00:38:16,864
I find all of those characters
very relatable.

608
00:38:16,865 --> 00:38:18,332
Those people remind me of my friends

609

and they remind me of myself.

610
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:26,875
At the end of the show
Johnny has gotten off drugs

but with a loving girlfriend.

615
00:38:50,666 --> 00:38:53,868

They knocked it out of
the park as they say.

624
00:39:38,246 --> 00:39:39,246
It was amazing.

625
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,627
We've had a month and a half
of rehearsals for this,

626
00:39:52,628 --> 00:39:54,495
so we were really ready for tonight.

627
00:39:54,496 --> 00:39:58,200
Um, but having a crowd that
was on board with us like that

628
00:39:58,201 --> 00:40:00,302
is a phenomenal feeling.

629
00:40:01,503 --> 00:40:04,638
It's always a little bit like,
"Ohhh" you know,

630
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:07,808
"please,
please like it" and part of me is like,

631
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:09,710
"you know what, we're
making a piece of art.

632
00:40:09,711 --> 00:40:11,814
We're putting it out there to the world,

633
00:40:12,014 --> 00:40:15,952
If we love it, if we believe in it,
that's what matters."

634
00:40:16,952 --> 00:40:19,386
I'm hoping the future is Broadway,

635
00:40:19,387 --> 00:40:20,988
which is something I've never touched.

636
00:40:20,989 --> 00:40:22,357
I've never been on Broadway before,

637
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:23,925
so this would be huge.

638
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:29,363
I felt sort of validated as a song writer,

639
00:40:29,364 --> 00:40:31,433
my melodies felt validated.

640
00:40:31,434 --> 00:40:33,502
You know,
people don't really talk about these things

641
00:40:33,503 --> 00:40:35,035
like that in the rock world so much,

642
00:40:35,036 --> 00:40:37,439
that, you know,
it's either a good song or it's a bad song,

643
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,772
or it's-you know, does it rock?

644
00:40:38,773 --> 00:40:40,709
Is there a riff? Where's the hook?

645
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,176
Where's the blah blah blah blah?

646
00:40:42,177 --> 00:40:43,646
Here we go.

647
00:40:54,389 --> 00:40:57,392
When Tom Kitt put his spin on it

648
00:40:57,393 --> 00:41:00,794
we were able to sort of
create sort of a dialogue

649
00:41:00,795 --> 00:41:03,365
I think I've been waiting to
have my entire life.

650
00:41:07,702 --> 00:41:11,605
So after we yanked Billie
Joe into our world,

651
00:41:11,606 --> 00:41:15,109
he turns around and invites us...

652
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,748
into the world of Green Day.

653
00:41:18,748 --> 00:41:19,748
Fuck.

654
00:41:26,054 --> 00:41:28,957
The cast was in Berkeley
doing the show every single day

655
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:31,392
and playing "21 Guns" every day.

656
00:41:31,393 --> 00:41:36,032
We were on tour playing
"21 guns" at the same time.

657
00:41:36,632 --> 00:41:39,701
So we said, "Well,
why don't we just do this thing together?

658
00:41:39,702 --> 00:41:42,706
Like-like let's do a recording."

659
00:41:43,706 --> 00:41:45,540
The challenge with "21 Guns"

660
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:48,844
is that it has so many
different layers to it.

661
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:03,692
So we had to keep track of
how they're supposed to fit

662
00:42:03,693 --> 00:42:05,641
when we were recording one at a time.

663
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:24,414

669
00:42:54,409 --> 00:42:57,044
For me recording and producing is...

670
00:42:57,045 --> 00:42:58,812
it's psychological.

671
00:42:58,813 --> 00:43:03,721

<i>♪ Did you try to live on your own? ♪</i>

675

00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,584

00:43:49,065 --> 00:43:51,170

Wow.

00:44:26,601 --> 00:44:27,669
- Hey, Christina?
- Yes?

699
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:30,305
Just simple, like, rhythmically, you and I,

700
00:44:30,306 --> 00:44:32,306
you're sort of holding
on the note a little bit.

701
00:44:32,307 --> 00:44:33,274
- Okay.
- Yeah, just go right into it.

702
00:44:33,275 --> 00:44:36,175
Okay, great.
Maybe I should stop clenching my fist.

703
00:44:36,478 --> 00:44:38,513
I'm like holding on to every note.

Except can we do one without sunglasses?

717
00:45:33,969 --> 00:45:35,969
I don't think we're there yet, Billie.

718
00:45:39,842 --> 00:45:41,609
The new arrangement of "21 Guns"

719
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:44,578
made me sort of re-
fall in love with the song.

720
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:47,415
you know, I think some
of these versions are-

721
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:49,585
are better than what we recorded.

When the Grammys

725
00:46:00,195 --> 00:46:03,897
asked Green Day to perform at the show,

726
00:46:03,898 --> 00:46:07,368
Billie Joe immediately said, "well,
I want to do it with my cast."

727
00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:10,471
- Here they are.
- Hey.

728
00:46:10,472 --> 00:46:11,538
It's the Grammy party.

729
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:13,841
- Grammy party's up in the air.
- Grammy party!

730
00:46:13,842 --> 00:46:16,877
I thought your hair might be down,
and sort of like that.

731
00:46:16,878 --> 00:46:18,546
<i>♪ She is one of a kind ♪</i>

733
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:27,421
It's a little too much fabric, though.

734
00:46:27,422 --> 00:46:30,058
Oh, yes!

735
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:32,060
You're a firebird.

736
00:46:32,061 --> 00:46:34,900
Oh my god, this is the Grammy outfit!

737
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,466
When we opened at Berkeley,

738
00:46:39,467 --> 00:46:43,538
there was a lot of interest in
bringing the show to New York.

739
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:45,772
And so, we are at the Grammys

740
00:46:45,773 --> 00:46:51,613
and we find out that we're
definitely going to Broadway.

741
00:46:51,614 --> 00:46:55,383
So not only do we get to
perform with Green Day,

742
00:46:55,384 --> 00:46:56,783
on the Grammy Awards,

743
00:46:56,784 --> 00:47:00,587
we get to actually say that
we're gonna be on Broadway.

744
00:47:00,588 --> 00:47:02,824
- This is nuts.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

745
00:47:05,427 --> 00:47:08,006
Show 'em your talent, buddy.
Show 'em your talent.

746
00:47:08,206 --> 00:47:10,665
I don't know if you guys
have done award show thing

747
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:12,834
or anything close to it, but it's like...

748
00:47:12,835 --> 00:47:14,768
kinda basically playing to cameras

749
00:47:14,769 --> 00:47:16,638
more than it is playing to the crowd,

750
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:18,538
'cause everybody's a fucking zombie.

751
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:20,741
Like they're all-everyone's nominated,

752
00:47:20,742 --> 00:47:22,209
like white knuckling it the whole time,

753
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:23,377
you know, like.

754
00:47:23,378 --> 00:47:25,879
So that's one thing
we figured out a long time ago.

755
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,951
In the beginning,
three punks created a rock masterpiece

756
00:47:29,952 --> 00:47:31,585
called "American Idiot".

757
00:47:31,586 --> 00:47:32,854
Their dreams live on,

758
00:47:32,855 --> 00:47:35,957
and "American Idiot"
has become a stage musical

759
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:39,794
about to hit Broadway
in a big way this March.

760
00:47:39,795 --> 00:47:42,462

We don't know what to call it.

815
00:52:32,654 --> 00:52:35,256
It's not an opera really,

816
00:52:35,257 --> 00:52:41,796
and it's definitely not your parents'
Broadway musical.

817
00:52:41,797 --> 00:52:44,534
So I don't know how-how it's gonna go down.

818
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,767
The thing I was worried about

819
00:52:46,768 --> 00:52:49,169
is I wanted to make sure
people had open minds.

820
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:51,571
When you're bringing your
family to go see something,

821
00:52:51,572 --> 00:52:53,140
on Broadway,

822
00:52:53,141 --> 00:52:54,575
it's hard to kind of go,

823
00:52:54,576 --> 00:52:56,877
"now,
do I feel like being challenged right now?

824
00:52:56,878 --> 00:52:59,747
Or do I want like, um...

825
00:52:59,748 --> 00:53:01,384
a nice little fairy tale?"

826
00:53:02,384 --> 00:53:05,688
American Idiot is like...
it's a cold reality.

827
00:53:07,688 --> 00:53:10,957
- Hi.
- Yes, yes yes yes.

828
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:12,792
I skyped with Hoggett this morning.

829
00:53:12,793 --> 00:53:15,562
He sends all his love,

830
00:53:15,563 --> 00:53:20,401
he's "gutted" not to be here.
He's just "gutted".

831
00:53:20,402 --> 00:53:22,970
But I described to him basically

832
00:53:22,971 --> 00:53:25,339
the adjustments that
Lorin and I are making,

833
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,774
and he thinks that all sounds great.

834
00:53:27,775 --> 00:53:29,542
So gear up.

835
00:53:29,543 --> 00:53:30,710
What will be required

836
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:34,180
will be even more than
what was required prior.

837
00:53:34,181 --> 00:53:35,915

we are starting up right away.

842
00:53:47,596 --> 00:53:49,062
What else is fucked?

843
00:53:49,063 --> 00:53:51,134
There's an incredible amount of stress.

844
00:53:52,134 --> 00:53:53,567
It's Broadway,

845
00:53:53,568 --> 00:53:56,972
and so you really are under the microscope.

846
00:54:03,144 --> 00:54:05,245
What we found in Berkeley

847
00:54:05,246 --> 00:54:10,750
was that we had a lot to do,
still, to improve the story.

848
00:54:10,751 --> 00:54:13,155
Saint Jimmy!

849
00:54:14,942 --> 00:54:17,258
As well as the staging,
and the choreography,

850
00:54:17,259 --> 00:54:18,392
and the arrangements.

851
00:54:18,393 --> 00:54:20,364

00:54:32,306 --> 00:54:34,140

856

And I was like,

939
00:58:52,701 --> 00:58:54,602
"I learned it when I was a little kid".

940
00:58:54,603 --> 00:58:57,471
<i>♪ Isn't it rich? ♪</i>

941
00:58:57,472 --> 00:59:01,207
<i>♪ Aren't we a pair? ♪</i>

942
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:05,578
<i>♪ Me here at last on the ground ♪</i>

943
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:10,183
<i>♪ You in mid-air ♪</i>

944
00:59:10,184 --> 00:59:13,287
<i>♪ Send in the clowns ♪</i>

945
00:59:13,288 --> 00:59:14,855
When I was a little kid,

946
00:59:14,856 --> 00:59:19,259
from the ages of like 4 and a half,
until I was about 14,

947
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:22,197
I took, like, vocal lessons.

948
00:59:22,855 --> 00:59:24,698
But I never told any of my friends,

949
00:59:24,699 --> 00:59:29,268
Like I-because it was-it
was just something that I did.

950
00:59:29,269 --> 00:59:31,705
And I was just learning
music, and you know,

951
00:59:31,706 --> 00:59:35,209
maybe it wasn't the most masculine thing,
or whatever, in the world.

952
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:37,343
<i>♪ Why can't they be like we were ♪</i>

953
00:59:37,344 --> 00:59:39,712
<i>♪ Perfect in every way ♪</i>

954

<i>♪ What's the matter with kids today? ♪</i>

955
00:59:42,995 --> 00:59:44,417
My mom would take me around

956
00:59:44,418 --> 00:59:46,654
and sing, like, at convalescent hospitals.

957
00:59:46,655 --> 00:59:49,288
And I would sing anything
from like Frank Sinatra,

958
00:59:49,289 --> 00:59:52,259
Al Jolson, George M. Cohen.

959
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:54,729
It would just be like stuff this woman,
Mrs. Favarone,

960
00:59:54,929 --> 00:59:56,562
she would teach me, and I didn't...

961
00:59:56,563 --> 00:59:58,732
I think it just kinds got
ingrained in my head.

962
00:59:58,733 --> 01:00:00,734
I wonder if that has had some impact,

963
01:00:00,735 --> 01:00:02,970
it must have,
in the way that you write songs...

964
01:00:02,971 --> 01:00:05,406
You take a song like "Wake me
Up When September Ends"

965
01:00:05,407 --> 01:00:07,508
which is the... you know,
one of the penultimate moment of the show,

966
01:00:07,509 --> 01:00:09,308
one of the penultimate
moments of the album,

967
01:00:09,309 --> 01:00:11,579
you know, and this progression...

968
01:00:17,818 --> 01:00:20,557
...which, you know, is so beautiful,

969
01:00:23,557 --> 01:00:27,661
and feels to me like Chorus Line,
"What I Did for Love".

970
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,704
Yeah. Wow, that's a good one.

971
01:00:42,811 --> 01:00:47,980
And then you have this major to minor,
which you know.

972
01:00:47,981 --> 01:00:53,353
"Love is Here to Stay", too,
does that major to minor.

973
01:00:55,255 --> 01:01:00,960
So it's-it is, all I mean it's
melodic and it's major to minor,

974
01:01:00,961 --> 01:01:02,863
it's the-it's the-

975
01:01:02,864 --> 01:01:05,499
it comes certainly from
this whole tradition.

976
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,167
Well I think album making,

977
01:01:08,168 --> 01:01:12,205
or the art of it for me, is like,
that it takes you on a ride,

978
01:01:12,206 --> 01:01:13,996
and the songs speak to each other.

979
01:01:16,945 --> 01:01:18,345
Okay that's a stretch.

980
01:01:18,346 --> 01:01:20,379
That's bad.

981
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:23,018
I don't know how to explain
how Billie Joe and I,

982
01:01:24,018 --> 01:01:26,520
who come from such different worlds,

983
01:01:26,521 --> 01:01:29,957
manage to have such a
fruitful collaboration.

984
01:01:29,958 --> 01:01:31,491
To me what's so interesting

985
01:01:31,492 --> 01:01:35,162
is it's that Tin Pan Alley stuff.

986
01:01:35,163 --> 01:01:38,665
I think it's because both of us,
at our hearts,

987
01:01:38,666 --> 01:01:40,067
are entertainers.

988
01:01:40,068 --> 01:01:41,901
- So it's not just about drugs.
- Yeah.

989
01:01:41,902 --> 01:01:44,705
'Cause here, it's such a metaphor,

990
01:01:44,706 --> 01:01:46,540
that he became that kind of...

991
01:01:46,541 --> 01:01:48,174
In my rock world,

992
01:01:48,175 --> 01:01:52,513
things get so competitive,
that sometimes it's a-

993
01:01:52,514 --> 01:01:55,783
you get into a mode where
people become discouraging.

994
01:01:55,784 --> 01:01:58,518
This was just a different feeling.

995
01:01:58,519 --> 01:02:00,587
It was almost-people were-

996
01:02:00,588 --> 01:02:02,522
you know,
I don't want to over-romanticize about it,

997
01:02:02,523 --> 01:02:04,691
but it was-everybody was
sort of encouraging each other,

998
01:02:04,692 --> 01:02:08,995
and... you know,
it's just-it's New York, it's not like-

999
01:02:08,996 --> 01:02:13,005
it's not some bullshit Hollywood crap,
you know.

1000
01:02:17,005 --> 01:02:20,174
The whole theatre thing
is really seductive,

1001
01:02:20,175 --> 01:02:22,209
and it's just inspiring too.

1002
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:27,715
<i>♪ I left my blood like
bullets over Broadway ♪</i>

1003
01:02:28,715 --> 01:02:31,618
Every day I had this discipline ritual

1004
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:33,386
where I would just write about anything.

1005
01:02:33,387 --> 01:02:35,388
It doesn't matter what it's about.

1006
01:02:35,389 --> 01:02:37,290
It doesn't have to even make sense.

1007

<i>♪ With broken legs and
roses over New York ♪</i>

1008
01:02:42,262 --> 01:02:45,098
I would just write something.
It would be 30 seconds,

1009
01:02:45,099 --> 01:02:47,500
it would be 40 seconds,
it would be two minutes.

1010
01:02:47,501 --> 01:02:49,669
I just had this momentum of just,
like, writing songs.

1011
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:51,772
And I would do that during the day,

1012
01:02:51,773 --> 01:02:55,110
and then I would end up going
to the show at night.

I just felt like a sponge.

01:03:01,916 --> 01:03:04,686
I just kind of sucked everything up.

1016
01:03:09,023 --> 01:03:10,756
So, what I'm gonna do

1017
01:03:10,757 --> 01:03:13,694
is look at swapping you guys out.

1018
01:03:13,695 --> 01:03:16,062
I just want to make sure
it doesn't translate

01:03:16,063 --> 01:03:17,864

<i>♪ Nobody's perfect and I stand accused ♪</i>

last little picky notes

1023
01:03:26,708 --> 01:03:30,112
or try new things for the last time.

1024

you were up here-ish.

01:03:40,588 --> 01:03:43,556
I don't think it should be busy. No.

Will!
Okay, hold.

1029
01:03:45,592 --> 01:03:48,694
So Carmel,
we're gonna make a small adjustment.

1030
01:03:48,695 --> 01:03:52,765
So it'll be "Oh shit,
this is my life." Bam bam-

1031
01:03:52,766 --> 01:03:54,402
as opposed to a question.

1032
01:03:55,402 --> 01:03:58,172
Oh shit, this is my life.

Full cast in the house, please.

1037
01:04:10,918 --> 01:04:14,087

1038
01:04:14,088 --> 01:04:16,089
so fly with it.

It's such a weird feeling because since,
you know,

1042
01:04:23,197 --> 01:04:25,399
since the beginning we've
been working and working

1043
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:28,301
and shifting things and finding it.

I'm here to welcome you
to the Gypsy robe ceremony

1056
01:05:13,981 --> 01:05:16,216
for the opening night on Broadway,

1057
01:05:16,217 --> 01:05:18,418
of American Idiot!

1058
01:05:22,889 --> 01:05:25,759
Everyone who's making their
Broadway debut tonight

1059
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,396
come here to the center of the stage.

1060
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:38,939
The Gypsy robe tradition began in 1950

1061
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:41,341
when a chorus dancer in
"Gentlemen Prefer Blonds"

1062
01:05:41,342 --> 01:05:43,709
sent a dressing robe to
the Imperial Theater

1063
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:45,278
where "Call me Madam" was opening

1064
01:05:45,279 --> 01:05:48,180
with a note proclaiming the
robe had been worn

1065
01:05:48,181 --> 01:05:51,917
by all the Ziegfeld beauties
and would bless their show.

1066
01:05:51,918 --> 01:05:54,955
the Gypsy robe is awarded
to a member of the chorus

1067
01:05:54,956 --> 01:05:58,225
who has the most Broadway
musical chorus credits.

1068
01:05:58,226 --> 01:06:00,160
The honored gypsy puts on the robe,

1069
01:06:00,161 --> 01:06:04,064
circles the stage three times
counter-clockwise,

1070
01:06:04,065 --> 01:06:06,399
and the show is blessed.

1071
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,267
Yeah!!

1072
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:09,803
It will be our pleasure

1073
01:06:09,804 --> 01:06:12,339
to see the Gypsy robe for American Idiot

1074
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:15,876
presented to Andrew Call.

1075
01:06:21,983 --> 01:06:23,885
Congratulations!

1076
01:06:47,775 --> 01:06:49,776
I always looked at Broadway

1077
01:06:49,777 --> 01:06:52,078
as being some sort of impossible dream.

1078
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:53,180
It is my goal, it is my dream,

1079
01:06:53,181 --> 01:06:54,848
and I'm living it right now.

1080
01:06:54,849 --> 01:06:56,652
It feels so good.

1081
01:07:00,387 --> 01:07:03,290
These actors,
they put so much passion and heart

1082
01:07:03,291 --> 01:07:04,659
into what they're doing.

1083
01:07:05,259 --> 01:07:07,160
I heard Liza Minnelli is coming tonight.

1084
01:07:07,161 --> 01:07:09,428
Oh you punk kids were just terrific!

1085
01:07:09,429 --> 01:07:13,466
I loved what you were doing-all
that stomping around on stage,

1086
01:07:13,467 --> 01:07:15,036
it was simply inspired.

1087
01:07:15,636 --> 01:07:17,971
I woke up today thinking,
"Okay, it;s just another show,

1088
01:07:17,972 --> 01:07:18,971
it's just another show."

1089
01:07:18,972 --> 01:07:20,107
But it's not just another show.

1090
01:07:20,108 --> 01:07:23,146
It's American Idiot! On Broadway, you know?

1091
01:07:27,981 --> 01:07:30,192
It was really strange to see Donald Trump.

1092
01:07:32,085 --> 01:07:35,654
I was like,
"what the fuck are you doing here? Really?"

1093
01:07:35,655 --> 01:07:37,124
In 3, 2, 1...

1094
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:40,794
Green Day is used to the stage,
but now they're coming to Broadway.

1095
01:07:40,795 --> 01:07:42,696
I am Ann Craig. Coming up, I'm taking you

1096
01:07:42,697 --> 01:07:45,765
inside their brand new
musical American Idiot.

1097
01:07:45,766 --> 01:07:47,103
It's showtime.

1098
01:07:48,779 --> 01:07:50,569
Did you ever think you'd get here?

1099
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:53,775
Uh...

1100
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:58,481
I've been working for this for 30 years...

1101
01:08:01,481 --> 01:08:04,584
I hoped I would make it.

1102
01:08:04,585 --> 01:08:06,720
The application of eye shadow

1103
01:08:06,721 --> 01:08:09,189
is a very very delicate procedure.

1104
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:11,424
We all believe in it so much...

1105
01:08:11,425 --> 01:08:13,225
But um...

1106
01:08:13,226 --> 01:08:16,765
I've never felt so lucky in my entire life.

1107
01:08:18,765 --> 01:08:20,002
You deserve it, man.

1108
01:08:21,002 --> 01:08:22,635
Thanks. Thanks.

1109
01:08:22,636 --> 01:08:24,403
Opening night, baby!

1110
01:08:24,404 --> 01:08:28,041
It's gunmetal grey. I had to.

1111
01:08:28,042 --> 01:08:31,211
I love boys, they're stupid!

1112
01:08:31,212 --> 01:08:33,613
I don't know what to expect.

1113
01:08:39,921 --> 01:08:42,988
It's kind of helpful to be like,
"I can handle it".

1114
01:08:42,989 --> 01:08:45,325
I'm saying this now I'm thinking,

1115
01:08:45,326 --> 01:08:48,233
"Okay, you're definitely
jinxing yourself right now."

1116
01:08:52,233 --> 01:08:54,170
And now we're at 15 minutes.

1117
01:08:55,871 --> 01:08:57,871
It's time to unleash this on New York.

1118
01:08:57,872 --> 01:08:58,438
Let's do it.

1119
01:08:58,439 --> 01:09:01,576
1, 2, 3, it's fucktime!

1120
01:09:17,658 --> 01:09:20,795

1124
01:09:37,444 --> 01:09:39,413
The reaction was amazing.

1125
01:09:40,413 --> 01:09:43,116
One hard-core Green Day fan is like,
"Oh my god."

1126
01:09:43,117 --> 01:09:44,819
I go, "It's not what you
thought it was gonna be was it?"

1127
01:09:45,019 --> 01:09:47,454
He was like, "Not at all."

1128
01:09:51,024 --> 01:09:54,394
And then I heard someone say,
"I guess this was inspired

1129
01:09:54,395 --> 01:09:56,962
by a rock band or something like that."

1130
01:09:56,963 --> 01:09:59,431
I mean they had no clue what Green Day was,

1131
01:09:59,432 --> 01:10:01,201
and that was really exciting,

1132
01:10:01,202 --> 01:10:04,037
because it was reaching
a whole new audience.

1133
01:10:56,957 --> 01:10:58,892
Amazing performances,

1134
01:10:58,893 --> 01:11:00,727
incredible energy,

1135
01:11:00,728 --> 01:11:03,129
not like anything else on Broadway.

1136
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:06,666
My next guests star in the
acclaimed new Broadway musical

1137
01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:09,301
based on the Green Day album
of the same name.

1138
01:11:09,302 --> 01:11:11,103
From the looks of things tonight,
I can tell you

1139
01:11:11,104 --> 01:11:13,939
this show is going to attract
a whole new crowd

1140
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:15,341
right here on Broadway.

1141
01:11:15,342 --> 01:11:18,278
Okay, here's the deal,
and this is the honest to god truth,

1142
01:11:18,279 --> 01:11:20,714
I don't read the reviews. I really don't.

1143
01:11:20,715 --> 01:11:22,081
American Idiot is getting

1144
01:11:22,082 --> 01:11:23,750
- phenomenal reviews.
- Great reviews.

1145
01:11:23,751 --> 01:11:27,386
I know that we got some ecstatic notices.

1146
01:11:27,387 --> 01:11:29,788
Almost the best thing
I've seen on Broadway.

1147
01:11:29,789 --> 01:11:33,163
And some notices that were
carping about this or that.

1148
01:11:37,163 --> 01:11:42,736
But I will say the audience
response was over the top.

1149
01:11:42,737 --> 01:11:44,403
It was crazy.

1150
01:11:44,404 --> 01:11:47,407
It was wild. Uh...

1151
01:11:47,408 --> 01:11:50,343
You know, I would just-all that
electricity, that excitement,

1152
01:11:50,344 --> 01:11:54,748
and sort of everything felt
like it was on fire.

1153
01:12:02,355 --> 01:12:07,693
Billie Joe went from being
moderately interested,

1154
01:12:07,694 --> 01:12:12,434
to getting more intrigued...

1155
01:12:13,434 --> 01:12:16,301
to becoming passionate

1156
01:12:16,302 --> 01:12:20,440
about what the whole Broadway vibe was.

1157
01:12:27,981 --> 01:12:32,285
So by the time I suggested to him

1158
01:12:32,286 --> 01:12:34,353
that my secret dream

1159
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:38,090
was that someday he would
play Saint Jimmy...

1160
01:12:38,091 --> 01:12:40,359
he couldn't-I-I saw a little light...

1161
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:43,362
behind his eyes, a flicker of excitement.

1162
01:12:43,363 --> 01:12:44,764
He said, "Oh really? You think so?"

1163
01:12:44,765 --> 01:12:46,198
I'm like, "Uh-huh."

1164
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:49,536
And the next day he called and said,

1165
01:12:49,537 --> 01:12:53,305
"Oh my god, are you serious about this?
I'm shitting."

The first day I rehearsed, Michael goes,

1171
01:13:08,421 --> 01:13:12,591
"Oh, there's something
I forgot to tell you.

1172
01:13:12,592 --> 01:13:16,395
This is going to be
really awkward at first."

1173
01:13:16,396 --> 01:13:18,363
And it was really awkward.

1174
01:13:18,364 --> 01:13:20,399
Don't look at the girls until the scream.

1175
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,367
Okay.

1176
01:13:21,368 --> 01:13:23,368
Just be focused on him.

1177
01:13:23,369 --> 01:13:26,574
They don't even penetrate
your consciousness.

1178
01:13:27,574 --> 01:13:29,274
I was really really nervous

1179
01:13:29,275 --> 01:13:31,644
about whether I could do it at all.

1180
01:13:31,645 --> 01:13:32,645
Here we go, ready?

1181
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:35,247
He didn't want the press to come,

1182
01:13:35,248 --> 01:13:38,251
he didn't want people to talk about it.

1183
01:13:38,252 --> 01:13:40,286
It was absolutely hush hush.

1184
01:13:40,287 --> 01:13:42,287
Do you mind? Just for me to see it again.

1185
01:13:42,288 --> 01:13:44,323
So we'd sneak him into a theater

1186
01:13:44,324 --> 01:13:45,657
where we would rehearse.

1187
01:13:45,658 --> 01:13:47,093
See how cool that looks?

1188
01:13:47,094 --> 01:13:50,030
She does that all in one.
You stop yourself.

1189
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:52,899
She's a professional dancer.

1190
01:13:57,805 --> 01:13:59,774
Are you asleep?

1191
01:14:01,774 --> 01:14:04,176
I was nervous about acting in general,

1192
01:14:04,177 --> 01:14:06,446
you know, like, the silent moments,

1193
01:14:06,447 --> 01:14:08,915
the stillness in parts.

1194
01:14:08,916 --> 01:14:11,818
I'm not used to doing that at all.

1195
01:14:11,819 --> 01:14:16,589
It's dead silent and your
brain's going brrrrr you know...

1196
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:21,094
"stay still, don't say anything."

1197
01:14:21,095 --> 01:14:24,266
You know, that part was hard.

1198
01:14:26,266 --> 01:14:30,169
He was freaked out.
He didn't know if he'd be any good.

1199
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:32,505
Is life imitating me
or is rage imitating life?

1200
01:14:32,506 --> 01:14:35,508
I feel like a civil war,
like a knife in the heart!

1201
01:14:35,509 --> 01:14:39,178
I've got an axe to grind
and it's splitting my head open!

1202
01:14:39,179 --> 01:14:42,815

Saint Jimmy!

1224
01:16:15,274 --> 01:16:19,645
In the old days,
coming from sort of an underground scene,

1225
01:16:19,646 --> 01:16:22,381
there was a lot of bands
that you would watch

1226
01:16:22,382 --> 01:16:25,151
that were your friends'
bands and things like that.

1227
01:16:25,152 --> 01:16:27,586
You know,
everyone would sort of feed off each other,

1228
01:16:27,587 --> 01:16:30,587
and have fun, but at the same time be,
you know, learning.

1229
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:38,697
Once Green Day took off,
we started losing that.

1230
01:16:38,698 --> 01:16:42,068
We were losing friends, which is fine,

1231
01:16:42,069 --> 01:16:44,103
you know, it's like, you only need a few.

1232
01:16:44,104 --> 01:16:47,576
But it's um... it's uh...

1233
01:16:49,576 --> 01:16:52,377
it gets, um... it just became difficult

1234
01:16:52,378 --> 01:16:57,250
to sort of find, um,
kindred spirits in that way

1235
01:16:57,251 --> 01:16:59,152
<i>♪ We are the world ♪</i>

1236
01:16:59,153 --> 01:17:01,453
Which charity is this for?

1237
01:17:01,454 --> 01:17:02,822
Mine!

1238
01:17:02,823 --> 01:17:05,692
When the cast came along
I started to feel it again

1239
01:17:05,693 --> 01:17:06,792
and Ive always wanted that.

1240
01:17:06,793 --> 01:17:10,095
I've always been,
almost-almost naïve about it,

1241
01:17:10,096 --> 01:17:12,800
where I wanted to make those
kinds of relationships...

1242
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,527
Did we get it? Did we get it?

1243
01:17:15,101 --> 01:17:17,505
and it didn't happen in
rock and roll music.

1244
01:17:18,505 --> 01:17:20,774
It happened in theatre.

1245
01:17:23,844 --> 01:17:27,679
That's the thing that sort of,
uh, blindsided me.

And don't wear it out!

1258
01:19:04,845 --> 01:19:07,793
Did I tell ya how many times
I've been reprimanded for...

1259
01:19:09,215 --> 01:19:10,883
- That was the best.
- For bad behavior.

1260
01:19:10,884 --> 01:19:11,884
I know.

1261
01:19:18,792 --> 01:19:21,961
One night I grabbed a bottle of
whiskey and took a sip of it.

1262
01:19:21,962 --> 01:19:25,398
And then- and then um...

1263
01:19:25,399 --> 01:19:26,465
and I remember you going-you were like,

1264
01:19:26,466 --> 01:19:27,733
"You can't do that."
- Right.

1265
01:19:27,734 --> 01:19:30,670
You know, it was like, "note",
and it was like my notes was,

1266
01:19:30,671 --> 01:19:34,645
"Don't get bottle of whiskey
and bring it one stage."

1267
01:19:39,245 --> 01:19:40,779
Then the naked cowboy happened,

1268
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:42,938
and then everything was off to the races.

1269
01:19:48,154 --> 01:19:49,755
And then another time,

1270
01:19:49,756 --> 01:19:52,058
I ran out and grabbed a bunch of Twizzlers,

1271
01:19:52,059 --> 01:19:54,193
and I threw it at the whole crowd,

1272
01:19:54,194 --> 01:19:55,627
and they were like "yeah!"

1273
01:19:55,628 --> 01:19:57,162
I was like, "Oh, that was pretty cool."

1274
01:19:57,163 --> 01:19:58,864
And then...

1275
01:19:58,865 --> 01:20:00,733
and then all of a sudden,

1276
01:20:00,734 --> 01:20:05,036
here comes Tom Hulce
walking back and he was like-

1277
01:20:05,037 --> 01:20:10,376
he goes, "Um... you... um...

1278
01:20:10,377 --> 01:20:14,380
there's this thing going on on the stage

1279
01:20:14,381 --> 01:20:17,884
and um... it's...

1280
01:20:17,885 --> 01:20:21,687
you can't run off of it because it's...

1281
01:20:21,688 --> 01:20:25,858
it's really disruptive to
what's happening on stage."

1282
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:27,193
And I go,

1283
01:20:27,194 --> 01:20:31,198
"So, you don't want me to throw
Twizzlers at people anymore?"
