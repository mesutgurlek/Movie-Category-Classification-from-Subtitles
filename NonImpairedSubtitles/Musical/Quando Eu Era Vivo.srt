9
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:08,801
Let me see that book.

10
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:16,577
Hush, it's dad.

11
00:01:20,736 --> 00:01:22,182
Pedro?

12
00:01:40,582 --> 00:01:42,433
Junior?

13
00:01:42,434 --> 00:01:44,243
Junior!

WHEN I WAS ALIVE

15
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:14,567
<i>Hello?</i>

16
00:05:15,103 --> 00:05:16,765
Hi, it's me.

17
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:18,869
- <i>Me who?</i>
- Me.

18
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:22,488
<i>I'm going down.</i>

19
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:01,914
I thought you were
only coming tomorrow.

20
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,414
Is that all the luggage?

21
00:06:06,756 --> 00:06:09,037
It's a madman
from the street.

22
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:13,032
His family abandoned him,
now he's homeless... So sad.

23
00:06:13,904 --> 00:06:16,777
Come in. It's not good
staying out this late.

24
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:37,229
We changed the wiring,
there are sensors now.

25
00:06:37,953 --> 00:06:41,131
The whole building
was renovated.

26
00:06:54,007 --> 00:06:57,800
The elevator's also new.
Did you see how fast it goes?

27
00:06:57,801 --> 00:07:00,476
The other one was
like a locomotive, remember?

28
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:05,352
If we don't take
good care of things, they end.

29
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:35,712
There's only the sofa.

30
00:07:35,713 --> 00:07:39,896
Bruna is staying in your room,
that girl from Avare.

31
00:07:47,848 --> 00:07:49,852
Where are the grates?

32
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,806
After your mother died,
I decided to take them all out.

33
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:57,765
It only made sense
when you two were little.

34
00:07:58,588 --> 00:08:02,921
But I reupholstered
the sofa, it's great.

35
00:08:03,545 --> 00:08:06,298
And the pillow is made
out of that Nasa foam,

36
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:08,761
that remembers
people's shape.

37
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,443
Even I like sleeping here.

38
00:08:11,998 --> 00:08:13,573
Sometimes...

39
00:08:18,107 --> 00:08:20,049
Is Caio OK?

40
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,302
I thought
he was coming with you.

41
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:24,805
He chose to stay with her.

42
00:08:27,188 --> 00:08:29,723
You need to explain everything
to your lawyer,

43
00:08:29,724 --> 00:08:32,284
with this whole
custody thing.

44
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:37,262
The mother always wins.

45
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:44,488
Thanks for having me.

46
00:08:45,118 --> 00:08:47,101
Don't worry...

47
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,493
You can tell me
all about it later.

48
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,261
You need to rest.

49
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,665
I didn't want to wake you,
but if I skip my routine,

50
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,495
my doctor will kill me.

51
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:28,278
- Did I oversleep?
- It's 11 AM.

52
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:34,076
There's coffee for you
in the kitchen.

53
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,855
Aren't you thinking
about having lunch?

54
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:43,218
I need to go, I have
so many things to do.

55
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:47,381
I'll find the number
of that hotel I promised you.

56
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:51,114
Perhaps we can get dinner,
what do you think?

57
00:10:51,457 --> 00:10:52,809
That's fine.

58
00:10:54,562 --> 00:10:56,750
Bruna is great.

59
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,839
She never delayed
a single day in rent.

60
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:04,356
It's not much,
but for a retired man like me,

61
00:11:04,357 --> 00:11:06,039
it's already something.

62
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,080
You should meet her.

63
00:11:10,942 --> 00:11:15,397
<i>Hello, I'm Zuzu.
I come from space.</i>

64
00:11:15,398 --> 00:11:19,869
<i>I came to talk to you, kid,
who's all alone, no one to play,</i>

65
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,251
<i>sometimes you don't have
someone to play with.</i>

66
00:11:22,252 --> 00:11:25,978
<i>So, my hint is: Make up
your friend! That's right!</i>

67
00:11:33,195 --> 00:11:35,693
Hi, I'd like
to talk to Tavares.

68
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:39,126
<i>It's very simple.
You'll need: Paper...</i>

69
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:40,571
It's a friend of his.

70
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:44,808
<i>You'll also need
non-toxic glue,</i>

71
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:49,680
<i>a pair of children's scissors,
that's very important.</i>

72
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:51,083
<i>Now that everything's set...</i>

73
00:11:51,084 --> 00:11:53,044
OK, I'm waiting.

74
00:11:53,331 --> 00:11:57,694
<i>Let's fabricate a paper doll</i>

75
00:11:57,695 --> 00:12:01,992
<i>Make a drawing
with pen or pencil</i>

76
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:06,403
<i>Cut the legs
very carefully</i>

77
00:12:06,404 --> 00:12:10,748
<i>Then the arms,
one at each side</i>

78
00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:15,088
<i>After you cut
the whole body,</i>

79
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:19,940
<i>don't cut
the poor guy's head out!</i>

80
00:12:20,544 --> 00:12:23,348
<i>Did you get it? No?</i>

81
00:12:23,349 --> 00:12:25,451
<i>We'll explain again.</i>

82
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:28,814
<i>Now, using
the children's scissors...</i>

83
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,515
Did you get some rest?

84
00:13:19,421 --> 00:13:22,579
I had forgotten
how we used to eat eggs here.

85
00:13:24,548 --> 00:13:27,626
That was your mother's,
where did you find that?

86
00:13:27,627 --> 00:13:29,306
In a drawer.

87
00:13:30,104 --> 00:13:31,572
Which one?

88
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:34,893
In the living room.
What's the matter?

89
00:13:36,155 --> 00:13:37,882
Nothing...

90
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,454
I thought I had
packed everything.

91
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:43,949
Did you talk to your friend?

92
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,587
Who?

93
00:13:46,935 --> 00:13:49,488
You said you'd talk
to a friend...

94
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,398
Tavares, that you
hadn't seen in years,

95
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,270
you said he'd get you
a job in Sao Paulo.

96
00:13:56,271 --> 00:13:58,386
No, his phone
number's changed.

97
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:01,134
Can't you look him up
in Orkut?

98
00:14:01,544 --> 00:14:03,661
I'll see that later.
Do you want to eat?

99
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:08,904
I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you,
I'm having dinner at Lurdinha's.

100
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:12,985
Lurdinha is a neighbor
from the eighth floor.

101
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:16,443
We're just starting...

102
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,262
...something.

103
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:23,273
I can make us some pasta
tomorrow, how about it?

104
00:14:24,006 --> 00:14:25,536
That's fine.

105
00:14:26,455 --> 00:14:29,612
When you finish,
turn off the gas.

106
00:14:56,374 --> 00:14:58,812
- Hi.
- Hi.

107
00:15:03,993 --> 00:15:05,755
Did you cook dinner?

108
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:10,042
This was my favorite dish
as a child.

109
00:15:30,736 --> 00:15:32,798
It makes me nauseous,
you know?

110
00:15:33,262 --> 00:15:34,595
Really?

111
00:15:34,596 --> 00:15:36,357
I swear.

112
00:15:40,462 --> 00:15:44,359
Since mr. Ze isn't home, let's
listen to some loud music.

113
00:15:45,352 --> 00:15:48,050
It's not the same
with headphones.

114
00:16:10,544 --> 00:16:12,863
Does my father
usually stay out for long?

115
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:14,249
It depends.

116
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,611
Do you know that one?

117
00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:17,346
That song?

118
00:16:17,347 --> 00:16:18,937
Yeah. Do you?

119
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:23,103
I don't think so.

120
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:25,045
Does it remind you
of anything?

121
00:16:25,741 --> 00:16:27,077
Madonna?

122
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:29,044
That's me.

123
00:16:30,631 --> 00:16:32,693
Do you go to music college?

124
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:36,711
I do. What kind
of pizza do you like?

125
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:39,393
Anything with cheese.

126
00:16:44,825 --> 00:16:47,051
Are you staying here
for a long time?

127
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,756
Not much.

128
00:16:50,237 --> 00:16:52,887
Just a few days,
until I find a place.

129
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:55,839
Did my father say anything?

130
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,878
No. Hi, I'd like to order.

131
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,631
I'd like a pizza, please.

132
00:17:03,173 --> 00:17:05,605
It'll be R$15 each.

133
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,723
You can pay me later.

134
00:17:09,317 --> 00:17:13,025
Large, pepperoni.
Without garlic, please.

135
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:20,897
"DIED..."

136
00:17:22,682 --> 00:17:25,566
"DIED..."

137
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:28,398
<i>Well, it could be
the sciatica.</i>

138
00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:30,916
<i>If it is, it's not
in my area of expertise.</i>

139
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,730
<i>It's not something I master.</i>

140
00:17:33,731 --> 00:17:36,593
<i>But what's part of my area
is the famous lactic acid.</i>

141
00:17:36,594 --> 00:17:38,894
<i>This lactic acid,
that everyone hears about,</i>

142
00:17:38,895 --> 00:17:40,392
<i>but no one knows what it is.</i>

143
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,693
<i>What I always say is this:</i>

144
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,260
<i>The important is
to die healthy.</i>

145
00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:47,100
<i>You can't give up on physical
exercise, even with pain.</i>

146
00:19:46,383 --> 00:19:48,065
I'm already awake.

147
00:19:48,677 --> 00:19:51,383
I'd like to introduce you
to a great friend of mine.

148
00:19:51,836 --> 00:19:53,543
Miranda.

149
00:19:53,544 --> 00:19:55,206
Manicure,

150
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:57,133
advisor,

151
00:19:57,134 --> 00:19:58,710
and psychic.

152
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:02,634
- Is that your first son?
- In the flesh.

153
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:05,264
Good morning.

154
00:20:05,265 --> 00:20:08,357
Good morning,
good morning,

155
00:20:08,358 --> 00:20:11,361
good morning, magic!

156
00:20:11,362 --> 00:20:13,476
It's late. Past 1 PM.

157
00:20:13,477 --> 00:20:16,326
I just need a little space...

158
00:20:17,374 --> 00:20:19,257
My God...

159
00:20:19,258 --> 00:20:22,988
No, look that way,
just so I can see one thing.

160
00:20:25,144 --> 00:20:27,833
It's the spitting image.

161
00:20:29,307 --> 00:20:33,573
Your nose... That bone
is just like your dad's.

162
00:20:33,574 --> 00:20:35,892
I hope you got
his kindness, too.

163
00:20:35,893 --> 00:20:38,978
Here's water.
There's coffee in the kitchen.

164
00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:40,939
I'm getting up.

165
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,417
I had already seen them,

166
00:20:43,418 --> 00:20:45,578
in the picture.
That picture,

167
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:50,579
in the farm, you were holding
the horse's reigns,

168
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,995
your brother
on top of the animal.

169
00:20:52,996 --> 00:20:54,961
I remember it because
of the bromeliads,

170
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,161
the farm was full of them.

171
00:20:59,632 --> 00:21:01,865
I'm allergic to bromeliads.

172
00:21:01,866 --> 00:21:05,158
My throat closes down,
I can't even speak.

173
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:08,710
Ze, didn't the picture
use to be here?

174
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:10,162
I put it away.

175
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:12,199
To keep it safe.

176
00:21:12,744 --> 00:21:16,085
- Do we have any aspirins?
- In the usual cabinet.

177
00:21:17,195 --> 00:21:18,863
Excuse me, Miranda.

178
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:25,963
<i>Where did you get
this black on your nails?</i>

179
00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:26,309
<i>That's a very strong word...</i>

180
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:29,237
<i>Let me see...</i>

181
00:22:29,238 --> 00:22:31,606
There's a great
love in your life,

182
00:22:31,607 --> 00:22:33,544
but you haven't seen it yet.

183
00:22:39,621 --> 00:22:42,449
Didn't the market have
the white one?

184
00:22:42,724 --> 00:22:45,068
No, only that one.

185
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:52,487
Less meat,
light tomato sauce, no garlic.

186
00:22:53,068 --> 00:22:55,266
That's great, thanks.

187
00:22:56,031 --> 00:22:59,954
I ran into Mathias,
the lawyer,

188
00:22:59,955 --> 00:23:02,478
by chance, at the club.
He's always there.

189
00:23:02,774 --> 00:23:04,188
I have a lawyer.

190
00:23:04,189 --> 00:23:05,994
You'll need a better one.

191
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:09,410
It's always good
having contacts up your sleeve.

192
00:23:09,643 --> 00:23:11,983
I worry about
my grandson too.

193
00:23:15,587 --> 00:23:17,359
Well...

194
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,078
I bought you both something.

195
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:24,753
As an apology for bothering.

196
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,680
Nothing fancy...

197
00:23:57,997 --> 00:24:00,543
How cute.
You didn't have to.

198
00:24:07,651 --> 00:24:09,314
What's this?

199
00:24:10,173 --> 00:24:13,019
There must be a mistake,
this wasn't what I bought.

200
00:24:13,555 --> 00:24:15,807
I bought a stone elephant,

201
00:24:15,808 --> 00:24:17,979
so you could put it
close to the door.

202
00:24:20,482 --> 00:24:23,047
This is crazy...
I'll take it back tomorrow.

203
00:24:24,737 --> 00:24:26,739
No, it's not a problem.

204
00:24:28,403 --> 00:24:29,980
It's big, huh?

205
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:37,749
I'm always curious to know
which face they use to...

206
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,368
to make these saints.

207
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:45,049
I was thinking of something
very important.

208
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,850
- What?
- It's a visitor's card.

209
00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:51,435
You have to let Miranda do it.
It'll change your life.

210
00:24:51,436 --> 00:24:54,320
That's the first thing they look
in a job interview.

211
00:24:54,321 --> 00:24:56,450
Is the resume finished?

212
00:24:57,098 --> 00:24:58,405
It is.

213
00:24:58,406 --> 00:25:00,186
I mean, I have to make
some changes,

214
00:25:00,187 --> 00:25:01,540
it's a bit outdated.

215
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,510
I have some samples,
if you want.

216
00:25:03,511 --> 00:25:05,186
And a printer, too.

217
00:25:10,481 --> 00:25:12,464
Single or married?

218
00:25:12,923 --> 00:25:15,107
That's a hard question.

219
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:20,485
Well, I'll print this one,
then you can complete it, OK?

220
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:21,660
OK.

221
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,845
My computer's kind of slow.

222
00:25:35,803 --> 00:25:38,023
There...

223
00:25:40,543 --> 00:25:41,936
What are you doing?

224
00:25:41,937 --> 00:25:44,844
This used to be
Pedro's bed, my brother.

225
00:25:52,442 --> 00:25:55,464
Didn't you ever feel
anything weird?

226
00:25:56,646 --> 00:25:59,059
When I lie down,
I sleep like a rock.

227
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,263
Even if rats
were in there...

228
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,641
It's Pedro's handwriting.

229
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,847
Is that blood?

230
00:26:14,848 --> 00:26:16,602
Stamp ink.

231
00:26:23,537 --> 00:26:27,271
It's funny, I've been dreaming
about him so much...

232
00:26:28,107 --> 00:26:30,090
Him and my mother.

233
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:34,967
BLOOD BROTHERS
I can't stop thinking
about this house...

234
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:37,843
And this room...

235
00:26:43,057 --> 00:26:45,185
I have a sister,
did you know?

236
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,507
Camila.

237
00:26:48,323 --> 00:26:50,839
I haven't seen her
since I came here.

238
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,247
She still lives in Avare.

239
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,243
But I'm not going
back there, no way.

240
00:27:01,947 --> 00:27:03,736
Hey, Paulo.

241
00:27:04,092 --> 00:27:06,564
Can I call you later?

242
00:27:07,522 --> 00:27:10,100
I'm a bit busy now.

243
00:27:10,646 --> 00:27:14,367
FULL NAME:
Jose Matos Junior

244
00:27:14,368 --> 00:27:16,934
ADDRESS:

245
00:28:18,194 --> 00:28:20,763
I've been thinking about
moving to the spare room.

246
00:28:23,256 --> 00:28:26,319
Is my morning exercise
bothering you?

247
00:28:26,761 --> 00:28:28,078
No.

248
00:28:28,725 --> 00:28:33,018
I got the phone of that hotel,
down the street, remember?

249
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:34,857
I'll pay, of course.

250
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,902
But what's the problem
with the spare room?

251
00:28:37,903 --> 00:28:40,406
It's full of garbage,
you can't even go in.

252
00:28:40,407 --> 00:28:42,403
Fine, I can take it all out.

253
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:45,292
No, I want you
to be comfortable.

254
00:28:46,979 --> 00:28:48,321
Fine...

255
00:28:48,963 --> 00:28:51,560
I don't even know
where I put the key.

256
00:30:32,209 --> 00:30:37,085
"For My Children"
Olga Matos

257
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,443
What's this?

258
00:30:59,139 --> 00:31:00,904
It was in the spare room.

259
00:31:02,306 --> 00:31:04,470
I found the key.

260
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:08,118
That must be rotten,
full of termites...

261
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:10,526
I don't want old things
in my living room.

262
00:31:10,527 --> 00:31:12,810
I'll have the superintendent
take it all away.

263
00:31:12,811 --> 00:31:16,089
There are no termites.
It's just like it was.

264
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,280
Like it was?

265
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:22,097
What did you do all day?
Is the headache better?

266
00:31:23,877 --> 00:31:25,552
And that, what is it?

267
00:31:25,869 --> 00:31:27,691
It's Lurdinha's.

268
00:31:27,692 --> 00:31:30,738
She lent it to me.
So I can watch in bed.

269
00:33:12,678 --> 00:33:17,326
PEDRO + ...
I LOVE YOU MOMMY

270
00:33:53,521 --> 00:33:55,425
I'm ready, go.

271
00:33:56,607 --> 00:33:58,037
Jump.

272
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:01,991
I said "jump",
not "skip like a gazelle".

273
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:05,729
Are you Pedro or Pedrita?

274
00:34:06,956 --> 00:34:08,828
Film over here.

275
00:34:11,453 --> 00:34:13,889
Play it right, Junior.

276
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,990
- Can you do better?
- I can.

277
00:34:19,152 --> 00:34:21,394
Let me film you, man.

278
00:34:25,632 --> 00:34:27,674
Try raising the camera.

279
00:34:27,974 --> 00:34:29,280
I can't see anything.

280
00:34:29,281 --> 00:34:32,016
- Let me try.
- Fine.

281
00:34:32,017 --> 00:34:34,187
Can you see her?

282
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:40,229
5 to the left,
3 to the side...

283
00:34:42,426 --> 00:34:44,730
- Can you hear it?
- I can.

284
00:34:44,731 --> 00:34:47,944
- What is he saying?
- He's pulling your leg tonight.

285
00:34:47,945 --> 00:34:50,326
- Stop it!
- It's true.

286
00:34:51,263 --> 00:34:55,599
"Pedro...
I'll pull your leg toni..."

287
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,141
5 to the left,
3 to the side, Pedro...

288
00:34:58,142 --> 00:34:59,691
That's it...

289
00:34:59,692 --> 00:35:01,334
I can't hear anything.

290
00:35:01,335 --> 00:35:04,406
He doesn't like you,
he won't talk to you.

291
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:07,509
He only talks to me and mom.

292
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:09,286
Stop it...

293
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:11,074
He thinks you're ugly.

294
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:12,898
You are.

295
00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:23,409
Strawberry flavor.

296
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:37,753
<i>The heads are
really good, Olga.</i>

297
00:36:37,754 --> 00:36:39,739
<i>They really are.</i>

298
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,896
<i>It's my time, I have to go.</i>

299
00:36:42,294 --> 00:36:43,711
Give it to me.

300
00:38:33,919 --> 00:38:36,417
<i>It's the serpent...</i>

301
00:40:05,682 --> 00:40:07,905
Why did you come back?

302
00:40:10,483 --> 00:40:12,104
I'll tell you one thing:

303
00:40:12,105 --> 00:40:15,236
You can't go back in time.

304
00:40:16,732 --> 00:40:19,415
Miranda said it's not good
keeping old things.

305
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:21,508
It brings bad energy
and bad luck,

306
00:40:21,509 --> 00:40:23,981
I should've solved this
a long time ago.

307
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:29,596
I made it myself.
With Bruna.

308
00:40:30,868 --> 00:40:32,921
But I don't speak English.

309
00:40:32,922 --> 00:40:35,036
You should have
learned by now.

310
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:42,556
The car's
picking you up at 3 PM.

311
00:40:42,557 --> 00:40:44,804
The driver's name is Donato.

312
00:40:44,805 --> 00:40:47,410
I left you a shirt
on the sofa.

313
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:50,261
Giani's waiting for you
at the shop to talk.

314
00:40:50,262 --> 00:40:52,217
Don't forget your resume.

315
00:41:22,993 --> 00:41:24,646
Mr. Jose Matos?

316
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,362
Yes.

317
00:41:27,363 --> 00:41:30,317
It must be funny, having
the same name as your father.

318
00:41:38,087 --> 00:41:40,642
I'm sorry, I just need
to check the hood,

319
00:41:40,643 --> 00:41:43,488
this engine's
a bit temperamental.

320
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:34,460
Lurdinha sent you a cake.

321
00:44:35,518 --> 00:44:38,196
This is for you
to check for a fever.

322
00:44:49,221 --> 00:44:51,868
I explained everything
to Giani.

323
00:44:52,476 --> 00:44:55,119
He'll see you another day.

324
00:45:00,252 --> 00:45:02,173
How is this pain
you're feeling?

325
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:04,377
On the head.

326
00:45:04,932 --> 00:45:09,689
Yes, but where?
Over here, at the back...?

327
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:11,612
It's everywhere.

328
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:17,110
I think it's best
to call dr. Romeo.

329
00:45:17,111 --> 00:45:18,968
I have his home number.

330
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:22,756
You don't need to call
or talk to anyone.

331
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:26,053
If it's head related,
it's always best to check.

332
00:45:26,054 --> 00:45:27,784
Your insurance
is valid, right?

333
00:45:27,785 --> 00:45:29,601
So it doesn't
make sense not to...

334
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:31,141
Shut up!

335
00:45:35,143 --> 00:45:37,066
I'm not my brother.

336
00:45:55,121 --> 00:45:57,826
Don't make any noise,
mr. Ze's home.

337
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,850
How bizarre...
What happened here?

338
00:46:07,851 --> 00:46:09,645
- Stop it.
- No.

339
00:46:10,328 --> 00:46:13,958
Stop it!
Give it to me.

340
00:46:17,464 --> 00:46:19,276
It's none of our business.

341
00:46:21,032 --> 00:46:23,402
5 minutes,
I'll be right back.

342
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:38,310
Wow...

343
00:46:46,124 --> 00:46:47,753
What's up, bro?

344
00:46:48,749 --> 00:46:50,167
How's it hanging?

345
00:47:02,675 --> 00:47:04,848
Hey! Can't you knock?

346
00:47:06,788 --> 00:47:08,475
It's just that...

347
00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:11,295
I found this.

348
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:14,323
It's my mother's.

349
00:47:14,867 --> 00:47:17,113
I wanted you
to play it for me.

350
00:47:17,915 --> 00:47:20,145
Can't you see I'm busy?

351
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,750
My mother used
to play the piano.

352
00:47:26,534 --> 00:47:29,004
We had a piano
in the living room.

353
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:32,340
But my father must have
thrown it away.

354
00:47:34,223 --> 00:47:35,662
Where are you going?

355
00:47:37,096 --> 00:47:38,873
I don't know.

356
00:47:40,972 --> 00:47:43,138
The night is young.

357
00:47:47,675 --> 00:47:49,025
<i>I'm ready.</i>

358
00:48:03,955 --> 00:48:05,503
May I come in?

359
00:48:31,668 --> 00:48:34,684
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to yell.

360
00:48:40,726 --> 00:48:42,193
It's alright.

361
00:48:52,252 --> 00:48:55,526
Do you know what mom did
with the cast heads?

362
00:48:56,828 --> 00:48:59,260
No, that was her business.

363
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:04,145
She kept it somewhere.

364
00:49:04,472 --> 00:49:07,556
I forgot where,
it's not in the spare room.

365
00:49:08,285 --> 00:49:10,495
This thing of making
your heads out of cast

366
00:49:10,496 --> 00:49:12,073
was part of her craziness.

367
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,112
She said she'd take it
to Aparecida city,

368
00:49:14,113 --> 00:49:17,234
that it would be good for you,
like a cleanse.

369
00:49:17,235 --> 00:49:19,346
She used
to love those things.

370
00:49:19,347 --> 00:49:21,544
- What things?
- The occult.

371
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:25,112
What about yours?

372
00:49:25,775 --> 00:49:28,223
Why didn't you
let her do yours?

373
00:49:28,748 --> 00:49:30,848
I don't believe
in that stuff.

374
00:49:33,734 --> 00:49:36,846
Someone had to put a stop
to those habits of hers.

375
00:49:36,847 --> 00:49:38,687
She was crazy.

376
00:49:39,367 --> 00:49:41,994
Your brother started
believing in those stories,

377
00:49:41,995 --> 00:49:45,711
and at the end,
he was crazy just the same.

378
00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:49,606
He wouldn't cross the T's.

379
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:52,381
- What?
- The letter "T".

380
00:49:52,382 --> 00:49:53,929
He'd always forget.

381
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,454
Do you miss him?

382
00:50:02,605 --> 00:50:04,455
I do.

383
00:50:06,364 --> 00:50:09,762
I miss how he was before.

384
00:50:10,412 --> 00:50:12,017
Before...

385
00:50:14,694 --> 00:50:18,195
Do you remember how
I used to put you to sleep?

386
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:22,992
You...

387
00:50:22,993 --> 00:50:26,626
You were very young...

388
00:50:27,503 --> 00:50:30,570
We'd take you to the car,

389
00:50:32,474 --> 00:50:36,980
and I'd cruise
around town with you,

390
00:50:38,756 --> 00:50:41,233
until you fell asleep.

391
00:50:41,598 --> 00:50:44,115
You rode backseat
with your mother,

392
00:50:44,116 --> 00:50:46,359
In that white Brasilia.

393
00:50:46,889 --> 00:50:48,986
The first car I ever bought.

394
00:50:50,516 --> 00:50:54,049
You'd keep saying
a bunch of things

395
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:57,277
in that crazy
baby language.

396
00:50:57,278 --> 00:50:59,048
And your mother
would laugh...

397
00:51:00,379 --> 00:51:03,895
I drove slowly,
looking at you two

398
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:05,833
on the rear view mirror.

399
00:51:06,812 --> 00:51:09,350
I'd leave the radio on,

400
00:51:09,351 --> 00:51:13,150
not playing music, you used
to like hearing the news.

401
00:51:14,701 --> 00:51:16,904
When you'd fall asleep,

402
00:51:18,654 --> 00:51:22,196
your mother would poke me
for me to turn down the volume.

403
00:51:23,325 --> 00:51:26,936
We'd cruise around
for a while more,

404
00:51:28,024 --> 00:51:30,260
so you didn't wake up.

405
00:51:34,808 --> 00:51:38,749
But then your mother started
to have her things...

406
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:42,694
Only she could put you
to sleep, no one else.

407
00:51:42,695 --> 00:51:45,623
And there were prayers,
and singing...

408
00:51:45,624 --> 00:51:48,842
Then the heads,
we had to make the heads.

409
00:51:48,843 --> 00:51:51,080
Make the heads,
make the heads...

410
00:51:52,935 --> 00:51:56,610
Once, we were coming back
from Rio, me and Lurdinha,

411
00:51:56,611 --> 00:51:58,650
and we stopped in Aparecida.

412
00:51:59,886 --> 00:52:04,011
While she took pictures,
I went to see the heads.

413
00:52:04,012 --> 00:52:06,525
Those saint offerings...

414
00:52:07,247 --> 00:52:12,089
I had an absurd idea that
if I found your brother's head

415
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:14,509
and brought it back to him,

416
00:52:14,904 --> 00:52:16,929
he could get better.

417
00:52:19,484 --> 00:52:22,336
Do you know
how many heads are there?

418
00:52:22,337 --> 00:52:23,868
I couldn't find it,
of course.

419
00:52:23,869 --> 00:52:26,251
I don't even know
if she took them there.

420
00:52:27,103 --> 00:52:29,751
But I made the mistake
of telling Pedro,

421
00:52:29,752 --> 00:52:32,964
and he became obsessed,
said I had to go back there,

422
00:52:32,965 --> 00:52:34,627
and look harder.

423
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,536
I want to visit Pedro.

424
00:52:37,537 --> 00:52:41,069
No way, are you crazy?

425
00:52:50,383 --> 00:52:52,221
<i>I'm ready, go.</i>

426
00:52:53,448 --> 00:52:54,733
<i>Jump.</i>

427
00:52:54,734 --> 00:52:58,480
<i>I said "jump",
not "skip like a gazelle".</i>

428
00:52:59,955 --> 00:53:01,977
<i>Are you Pedro or Pedrita?</i>

429
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:03,144
<i>Pedro.</i>

430
00:53:40,028 --> 00:53:42,811
<i>Only dad didn't want
to make the head.</i>

431
00:53:43,444 --> 00:53:46,808
- <i>Will he be sad?</i>
- <i>He's stubborn...</i>

432
00:53:48,076 --> 00:53:50,695
<i>Stop laughing, hold still.</i>

433
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:32,985
Mr. Ze?

434
00:54:33,539 --> 00:54:35,250
Is everything alright?

435
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,169
Just getting some air.

436
00:54:40,632 --> 00:54:43,549
I'm going to Lurdinha's
in a moment.

437
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:46,627
Is that all?

438
00:54:47,661 --> 00:54:49,345
It's my boy.

439
00:54:49,788 --> 00:54:51,778
I don't know
what else I can do to help,

440
00:54:51,779 --> 00:54:53,909
I'm feeling useless.

441
00:54:54,588 --> 00:54:57,047
I need to take him
to a doctor.

442
00:54:57,048 --> 00:55:00,219
I don't even know
how to bring it up.

443
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:02,794
I want to know if he's alright,

444
00:55:02,795 --> 00:55:05,292
maybe have a psychologist
look at him.

445
00:55:06,018 --> 00:55:08,894
I'm trying to talk to her,
to Marcia,

446
00:55:08,895 --> 00:55:10,828
to really know what happened.

447
00:55:10,829 --> 00:55:12,558
But she won't pick up.

448
00:55:12,813 --> 00:55:14,644
She hates me.

449
00:55:17,007 --> 00:55:18,664
Call from my cell.

450
00:55:18,665 --> 00:55:21,213
Maybe she won't pick up
because she knows it's you.

451
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:31,087
Nothing.

452
00:55:59,633 --> 00:56:01,011
Fuck!

453
00:56:01,012 --> 00:56:02,886
Are you trying
to scare me to death?

454
00:56:03,382 --> 00:56:04,835
I'm sorry.

455
00:56:04,836 --> 00:56:06,359
I didn't mean to scare you.

456
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,215
It's just that I
discovered something.

457
00:56:08,216 --> 00:56:10,373
Why are the lights
always like this now?

458
00:56:10,374 --> 00:56:11,988
Someone needs to check this.

459
00:56:11,989 --> 00:56:13,343
Look...

460
00:56:13,705 --> 00:56:15,556
Behind the music sheet.

461
00:56:16,243 --> 00:56:19,779
I discovered that my mother
left an anagram.

462
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:22,761
She used to love
giving us anagrams.

463
00:56:22,762 --> 00:56:26,366
If you take the first letter
of each word, you get this.

464
00:56:27,072 --> 00:56:29,256
The third gives you this.

465
00:56:29,894 --> 00:56:34,062
I'm sure she's trying
to tell me something.

466
00:56:34,648 --> 00:56:36,766
The letter "N", for example.

467
00:56:37,355 --> 00:56:39,630
I think it means "Christmas".

468
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:42,657
My mother used
to love Christmas.

469
00:56:43,407 --> 00:56:47,734
She'd hang saints on our tree
instead of balls.

470
00:56:50,071 --> 00:56:51,923
I wanted to ask you

471
00:56:51,924 --> 00:56:54,294
to help me understand this.

472
00:56:55,315 --> 00:56:57,091
What this means...

473
00:56:57,092 --> 00:57:00,320
Ask your father.
He may know what it is.

474
00:57:00,321 --> 00:57:02,000
That man is not my father.

475
00:57:06,018 --> 00:57:08,780
I mean, this man here now
is not my father.

476
00:57:08,781 --> 00:57:10,446
My father from before.

477
00:57:10,447 --> 00:57:11,764
It's not him.

478
00:57:13,778 --> 00:57:15,510
Relax a little.

479
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:20,175
Your father told me he's
sleeping at Lurdinha's tonight.

480
00:57:20,176 --> 00:57:22,381
We have
the house to ourselves.

481
00:57:24,061 --> 00:57:27,219
Relax, take this off.

482
00:57:28,883 --> 00:57:30,809
Will you help me
set the table?

483
00:57:57,887 --> 00:58:01,710
Mozzarella
and light turkey slices.

484
00:58:22,792 --> 00:58:24,375
Eat.

485
00:58:34,794 --> 00:58:36,566
It's good...

486
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:39,261
It's just a lasagna.

487
00:58:43,464 --> 00:58:44,940
What is it?

488
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:50,177
There's a smudge.

489
00:58:52,384 --> 00:58:54,309
Your hand's cold.

490
00:58:56,529 --> 00:58:59,070
When I was alive
it was warmer.

491
00:59:11,394 --> 00:59:14,301
Would you like to hear
something I wrote the other day?

492
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:29,366
<i>What is this fear that comes</i>

493
00:59:29,367 --> 00:59:31,679
<i>when night falls</i>

494
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,649
<i>It's the longing that comes</i>

495
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:35,950
<i>when the sun sets</i>

496
00:59:35,951 --> 00:59:41,193
<i>It's the longing for what...?</i>

497
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:46,966
<i>It's simply nostalgia</i>

498
00:59:46,967 --> 00:59:51,223
<i>The loneliness manifest</i>

499
00:59:53,101 --> 00:59:57,225
<i>Intermittent guest</i>

500
00:59:57,226 --> 01:00:01,747
<i>That never takes back
what he brings</i>

501
01:00:03,452 --> 01:00:06,836
It's something like that.
It's not finished yet.

502
01:00:22,367 --> 01:00:25,640
It's a music sheet for piano
and two voices.

503
01:00:26,848 --> 01:00:31,236
You see?
Piano and two voices.

504
01:00:31,237 --> 01:00:33,190
It must be yours
and your brother's,

505
01:00:33,191 --> 01:00:35,034
by the song's name.

506
01:00:35,035 --> 01:00:39,392
Yours must be the first,
and your brother's, the second.

507
01:00:39,393 --> 01:00:42,333
And these doodles

508
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:44,665
may be the lyrics,
I don't know.

509
01:01:43,092 --> 01:01:44,631
I'm sorry.

510
01:01:47,205 --> 01:01:49,408
I'm not feeling good,
I'm having a...

511
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:15,600
I HOPE YOU'RE
FEELING BETTER!

512
01:03:15,601 --> 01:03:19,668
I KEPT YOUR SHEET.
KISSES, BRUNA.

513
01:03:30,855 --> 01:03:32,953
Good luck, honey.

514
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:06,228
I just made them.

515
01:04:12,149 --> 01:04:13,817
Do you want it?

516
01:04:16,026 --> 01:04:18,177
Not now, I already ate.

517
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:30,919
I found her recipes.

518
01:04:31,488 --> 01:04:33,781
No one does it better.

519
01:04:42,426 --> 01:04:44,233
I'm going to take a shower.

520
01:05:05,743 --> 01:05:07,386
Bruna?

521
01:06:29,836 --> 01:06:31,375
Yes?

522
01:06:32,611 --> 01:06:34,328
Are you on the phone?

523
01:06:34,329 --> 01:06:35,772
I am.

524
01:06:37,221 --> 01:06:38,661
Well...

525
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:41,233
That's what I
came to ask you.

526
01:06:41,234 --> 01:06:44,142
If Marcia called...
That monster.

527
01:06:45,343 --> 01:06:48,478
She did. I talked to her.

528
01:06:48,479 --> 01:06:50,162
Is everything alright?

529
01:06:50,565 --> 01:06:52,344
Yeah...

530
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:56,960
Fine, then go back
to your phone call.

531
01:06:56,961 --> 01:06:59,016
I'm going to my bedroom.

532
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:02,030
I'm tired.

533
01:07:39,864 --> 01:07:42,144
I'm so horny...

534
01:07:44,034 --> 01:07:45,945
Come here...

535
01:07:50,753 --> 01:07:52,158
Wait.

536
01:07:53,423 --> 01:07:54,937
It's Marcia.

537
01:07:55,761 --> 01:07:57,862
Hello?

538
01:07:58,065 --> 01:08:02,524
It's... It's... Paloma.

539
01:08:02,525 --> 01:08:06,551
<i>You called me
the other day...</i>

540
01:08:07,238 --> 01:08:10,172
I don't recall calling you.

541
01:08:10,173 --> 01:08:12,056
Wasn't it wrong number?

542
01:08:12,567 --> 01:08:14,498
<i>Are you with Jose?</i>

543
01:08:14,499 --> 01:08:16,781
I know him, yeah... Why?

544
01:08:16,782 --> 01:08:18,704
He's my boyfriend.

545
01:08:18,705 --> 01:08:20,950
I think we can call it that.

546
01:08:20,951 --> 01:08:23,827
<i>You can't be serious.</i>

547
01:08:23,828 --> 01:08:26,517
Hey! I am serious!

548
01:08:26,518 --> 01:08:29,714
<i>Serious? You're
a skank, a whore...</i>

549
01:08:30,368 --> 01:08:31,944
Who was it?

550
01:08:35,168 --> 01:08:37,034
Come here, come...

551
01:08:38,419 --> 01:08:40,447
I don't like doing it here.

552
01:08:40,448 --> 01:08:41,890
Since when?

553
01:08:50,523 --> 01:08:52,679
- What is this shit?
- Give it back.

554
01:08:55,637 --> 01:08:58,010
Paulo, give it.

555
01:08:58,011 --> 01:08:59,637
It's from that guy, isn't it?

556
01:09:00,744 --> 01:09:02,398
What's wrong with you?

557
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:03,910
Just take me home...

558
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:10,532
Dr. Romeo,

559
01:09:10,533 --> 01:09:13,944
I remember when you
explained me about the phases.

560
01:09:13,945 --> 01:09:15,676
First there's
the confusion phase,

561
01:09:15,677 --> 01:09:17,575
when they only say nonsense.

562
01:09:18,305 --> 01:09:20,222
Then the calm comes.

563
01:09:20,223 --> 01:09:21,699
That's how he is now.

564
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,303
<i>Have patience...</i>

565
01:09:23,304 --> 01:09:25,182
I know, doctor,
I have patience.

566
01:09:25,183 --> 01:09:28,463
I observed his headache,
I did all that.

567
01:09:29,364 --> 01:09:31,228
<i>Then bring him to me...</i>

568
01:09:31,229 --> 01:09:33,443
He doesn't want to go there!

569
01:09:36,179 --> 01:09:38,571
It's just like what happened
to his brother.

570
01:09:39,514 --> 01:09:41,644
He's in phase two.

571
01:09:41,645 --> 01:09:45,082
<i>We can't know for sure...</i>

572
01:09:45,083 --> 01:09:47,349
But I can, I see it!

573
01:09:50,145 --> 01:09:53,932
- Doctor, I need to hang up.
- <i>Wait, wait...</i>

574
01:10:01,624 --> 01:10:03,483
Thank you, Bruna.

575
01:10:03,484 --> 01:10:04,829
I'll go get him.

576
01:10:17,418 --> 01:10:18,988
Here he is.

577
01:10:19,891 --> 01:10:22,394
Hi, beautiful.

578
01:10:22,395 --> 01:10:24,156
You can shave him, too.

579
01:10:24,157 --> 01:10:26,059
I don't do shaving.

580
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:29,112
I don't even carry
a razor, so I don't get asked.

581
01:10:29,752 --> 01:10:31,604
I'm very busy.

582
01:10:32,183 --> 01:10:34,465
You should have
told me before.

583
01:10:34,466 --> 01:10:36,169
- It'll be fast.
- Sure...

584
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:38,400
- She was available today.
- It'll be fast...

585
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:41,545
- Shall we start, Miranda?
- Sure, sure...

586
01:10:41,822 --> 01:10:44,102
- Have a seat.
- We're all set.

587
01:10:46,996 --> 01:10:49,244
Won't you start
with the nails?

588
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:54,261
No, I...

589
01:10:54,262 --> 01:10:57,766
Actually, it doesn't matter.
It's best to do this first,

590
01:10:57,767 --> 01:11:00,022
so I can feel him.

591
01:11:02,865 --> 01:11:04,479
Well...

592
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:08,870
Honey, straighten up.

593
01:11:08,871 --> 01:11:12,894
- So I can align your chakras.
- What is this?

594
01:11:13,342 --> 01:11:14,652
It's for your own good.

595
01:11:14,653 --> 01:11:18,070
It'll cleanse you,
you'll feel better.

596
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:28,766
Fine, we may begin.

597
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:37,618
Close your eyes,

598
01:11:38,339 --> 01:11:40,877
so I can feel you...

599
01:12:15,229 --> 01:12:17,982
Have you taken
your first communion?

600
01:12:19,356 --> 01:12:20,983
Yes, but...

601
01:12:23,622 --> 01:12:29,019
You can't come in here!

602
01:12:30,085 --> 01:12:32,967
You can't come in here!

603
01:12:32,968 --> 01:12:35,640
- You can't come in here!
- Who's that?

604
01:12:35,641 --> 01:12:40,212
You can't... come in here!

605
01:12:40,213 --> 01:12:44,284
You can't come in here!
You can't come in here!

606
01:13:00,917 --> 01:13:03,644
Now tell me, darling...

607
01:13:06,052 --> 01:13:08,018
What do you want?

608
01:13:11,322 --> 01:13:13,234
It doesn't matter
what I want.

609
01:13:13,871 --> 01:13:16,165
It matters what <i>she</i> wants.

610
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:18,197
And what does she want?

611
01:13:18,838 --> 01:13:21,637
The same she wanted
from my brother.

612
01:13:21,638 --> 01:13:23,931
And do you know
what that is?

613
01:13:27,402 --> 01:13:30,283
Do you know
what your brother did?

614
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:37,661
He tried to kill my father
with a .38 caliber pistol.

615
01:13:38,579 --> 01:13:41,210
But he didn't have bullets.

616
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:45,930
You don't want
to do that, OK?

617
01:13:45,931 --> 01:13:50,678
You don't want to do that.

618
01:13:50,679 --> 01:13:54,968
You... don't want
to do that.

619
01:13:54,969 --> 01:13:56,907
Your father loves you.

620
01:14:00,674 --> 01:14:02,815
He's not my father.

621
01:14:04,662 --> 01:14:07,288
That man over there
is not my father.

622
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:10,418
He never called me "son".

623
01:14:10,419 --> 01:14:11,979
Never.

624
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,021
Never in his life
has he called me "son".

625
01:14:14,022 --> 01:14:15,337
He's not my father.

626
01:14:17,909 --> 01:14:21,496
My house is my church,
my family is my creed.

627
01:14:21,844 --> 01:14:24,782
My house is my church,
my family is my creed.

628
01:14:24,783 --> 01:14:27,035
My house is my church,
my family is my--

629
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:57,837
What's happening in here, Ze?
It's all so dark...

630
01:14:58,417 --> 01:14:59,892
It's him.

631
01:14:59,893 --> 01:15:02,394
He turned the house
to what it was.

632
01:15:04,144 --> 01:15:07,066
There's something
in your boy, Ze.

633
01:15:08,073 --> 01:15:11,163
Ms. Neide's daughter,
my mother's neighbor...

634
01:15:11,164 --> 01:15:14,841
They thought she was possessed,
they even brought experts.

635
01:15:15,075 --> 01:15:19,279
Then they found out it was
a tapeworm maggot in the brain.

636
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,658
She had surgery
and that was it.

637
01:15:22,855 --> 01:15:24,492
I think...

638
01:15:24,493 --> 01:15:27,273
before we do something
more serious...

639
01:15:27,274 --> 01:15:29,359
you should take him
to a doctor.

640
01:15:30,095 --> 01:15:32,542
I know, Miranda.
I know.

641
01:15:34,334 --> 01:15:36,531
Are you wearing
your protection?

642
01:15:40,768 --> 01:15:43,044
Never take it off.

643
01:15:47,648 --> 01:15:49,222
Did he give you anything?

644
01:15:49,223 --> 01:15:52,487
Is there anything you have
from him recently?

645
01:17:00,942 --> 01:17:02,441
Hi, Bruna.

646
01:17:04,642 --> 01:17:06,231
Hi.

647
01:17:12,468 --> 01:17:14,030
Did you have dinner?

648
01:17:44,982 --> 01:17:46,431
May I come in?

649
01:17:50,087 --> 01:17:52,176
Do you have the music sheet?

650
01:17:52,637 --> 01:17:53,955
I do.

651
01:17:56,367 --> 01:17:57,996
Let me clear some space...

652
01:18:01,998 --> 01:18:03,282
Here.

653
01:18:11,486 --> 01:18:14,379
I need to show you
something, Bruna.

654
01:18:17,126 --> 01:18:18,593
Look.

655
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:24,135
It's my brother's
handwriting.

656
01:18:24,788 --> 01:18:27,485
He was the one
who wrote behind it.

657
01:18:29,102 --> 01:18:31,496
I need to visit Pedro.

658
01:18:31,497 --> 01:18:33,514
He knows what it says.

659
01:18:33,515 --> 01:18:37,692
My mom's dead but he isn't.
This is his handwriting...

660
01:18:40,709 --> 01:18:42,720
You better be careful.

661
01:18:42,721 --> 01:18:45,380
They want to take you
to a hospital.

662
01:18:58,632 --> 01:19:01,578
I have something
to show you, too.

663
01:19:56,478 --> 01:20:00,644
<i>Every time I look at you,</i>

664
01:20:01,776 --> 01:20:05,271
<i>my heart beats nonstop...</i>

665
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:11,589
Don't worry.

666
01:20:13,821 --> 01:20:16,454
It's her, talking to me.

667
01:20:19,328 --> 01:20:20,938
Can you hear it?

668
01:21:28,256 --> 01:21:29,391
Hi.

669
01:21:29,392 --> 01:21:32,379
I'm Lurdinha,
your father's girlfriend.

670
01:21:32,906 --> 01:21:36,356
I just came to lend
you guys a little hand.

671
01:21:44,536 --> 01:21:47,064
What is this?!

672
01:21:53,792 --> 01:21:56,325
No, let me go!

673
01:21:56,956 --> 01:21:59,832
Let me go, let me go!

674
01:22:06,244 --> 01:22:09,064
Help!

675
01:22:20,772 --> 01:22:23,065
You can't come in here.

676
01:22:23,666 --> 01:22:24,980
MAY GOD PROTECT THIS HOME.

677
01:22:24,981 --> 01:22:27,190
You can't come in here...

678
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:49,300
You had no right
to do that to her.

679
01:22:49,659 --> 01:22:51,623
No right!

680
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:27,330
<i>I came to get my TV.</i>

681
01:23:28,187 --> 01:23:31,832
- <i>Don't you want coffee...</i>
- <i>No, I just want my TV.</i>

682
01:23:33,271 --> 01:23:35,609
<i>"Lurdinha" my ass,
I want my TV!</i>

683
01:23:36,955 --> 01:23:38,895
<i>I want nothing
to do with you.</i>

684
01:24:29,403 --> 01:24:32,534
You'll visit your brother,
as you wish.

685
01:24:32,535 --> 01:24:34,845
You deserve to be grounded.

686
01:24:34,846 --> 01:24:38,276
We'll see the doctor afterwards.
We already have an appointment.

687
01:26:46,545 --> 01:26:48,383
Watch...

688
01:26:48,762 --> 01:26:50,837
Pen, pencil...

689
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:52,445
Anything else
that's piercing?

690
01:26:56,334 --> 01:26:58,903
Sir, your necklace.

691
01:26:59,981 --> 01:27:03,007
No. I never take it off.

692
01:27:04,095 --> 01:27:05,592
May I see it?

693
01:27:10,263 --> 01:27:12,107
You may go in.

694
01:27:29,018 --> 01:27:31,600
Did you like
the surprise, Pedro?

695
01:27:33,145 --> 01:27:35,196
He's still alive.

696
01:27:47,802 --> 01:27:50,363
Look, all your favorites.

697
01:27:50,364 --> 01:27:52,897
Chocolate cookies,
coconut candy...

698
01:27:52,898 --> 01:27:54,915
Soda...

699
01:27:55,355 --> 01:27:58,568
I couldn't find
that bubblegum you loved,

700
01:27:58,569 --> 01:28:00,565
but I brought a similar one.

701
01:28:06,045 --> 01:28:08,724
Your brother
was dying to see you.

702
01:28:09,085 --> 01:28:11,002
He missed you.

703
01:28:11,526 --> 01:28:12,961
Didn't you?

704
01:28:23,869 --> 01:28:26,173
"Blood brother."

705
01:28:27,647 --> 01:28:30,488
Put it... Put it away.

706
01:28:30,489 --> 01:28:31,988
What is this?

707
01:28:31,989 --> 01:28:34,200
You wrote
on the music sheet, isn't it?

708
01:28:34,201 --> 01:28:36,492
You and mom scrambled
the letters, right?

709
01:28:36,493 --> 01:28:38,591
- What does it say?
- Dad...

710
01:28:38,592 --> 01:28:41,062
Did you find the heads, dad?

711
01:28:41,063 --> 01:28:43,389
You must find
the heads, fast.

712
01:28:43,390 --> 01:28:46,063
Tell me, Pedro.
Tell me what it says!

713
01:28:46,064 --> 01:28:48,043
Give me this, let's put
an end to this.

714
01:28:48,044 --> 01:28:50,166
Give it back
or I'll kill you!

715
01:28:56,075 --> 01:28:58,454
Do you need anything?

716
01:28:59,546 --> 01:29:03,685
I wanted to be alone
with my brother, I miss him...

717
01:29:04,112 --> 01:29:07,314
- If it's OK by you...
- It is. It's OK...

718
01:29:07,315 --> 01:29:09,525
...by me. Yes.

719
01:29:29,489 --> 01:29:32,471
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you.

720
01:30:14,949 --> 01:30:17,010
Why did you take so long?

721
01:30:21,301 --> 01:30:23,478
I lived far...

722
01:30:26,846 --> 01:30:28,991
I missed you.

723
01:30:29,638 --> 01:30:31,309
Me too.

724
01:30:38,398 --> 01:30:40,288
Is there strawberry flavor?

725
01:31:05,265 --> 01:31:07,409
It's his language.

726
01:31:08,894 --> 01:31:11,752
She offered us to him.

727
01:31:13,092 --> 01:31:14,852
Both of us.

728
01:31:18,674 --> 01:31:21,930
Now she wants dad's soul.

729
01:31:22,552 --> 01:31:24,973
It's the only one left.

730
01:31:28,254 --> 01:31:30,362
Don't you remember anything?

731
01:31:33,945 --> 01:31:36,067
It's his prayer.

732
01:31:52,328 --> 01:31:54,233
Repeat it.

733
01:32:16,913 --> 01:32:19,392
Here's your medicine, Pedro.

734
01:32:20,334 --> 01:32:22,841
"I am the serpent
of the night.

735
01:32:22,842 --> 01:32:24,911
My body is your shelter.

736
01:32:24,912 --> 01:32:27,306
My blind eye I give to you.

737
01:32:27,307 --> 01:32:29,593
The head, I take with me."

738
01:32:49,954 --> 01:32:53,318
If you take these now,
the next ones will be at 7 AM.

739
01:32:53,319 --> 01:32:56,183
That way you won't have to
wake up in the middle of night.

740
01:32:56,184 --> 01:32:57,967
You must take it
at the right time,

741
01:32:57,968 --> 01:32:59,514
until the date of the exam.

742
01:32:59,515 --> 01:33:01,975
Dr. Romeo was very clear.
Take it.

743
01:34:47,559 --> 01:34:50,440
<i>"I am the serpent
of the night.</i>

744
01:34:50,441 --> 01:34:53,384
<i>The West wind brings me.</i>

745
01:34:53,385 --> 01:34:57,728
<i>Give me your...</i>

746
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:50,823
I hear you...

747
01:36:52,944 --> 01:36:55,556
I hear you...

748
01:37:05,017 --> 01:37:07,024
He's awake.

749
01:38:17,908 --> 01:38:23,303
I am the serpent
of the night.

750
01:38:27,838 --> 01:38:33,444
<i>I am the serpent
of the night.</i>

751
01:38:35,584 --> 01:38:41,216
<i>The West wind brings me.</i>

752
01:38:43,232 --> 01:38:49,412
<i>Give me your hand
and in exchange</i>

753
01:38:51,124 --> 01:38:57,024
<i>I'll give you my lilac wing.</i>

754
01:39:09,106 --> 01:39:14,408
<i>I am the serpent
of the night.</i>

755
01:39:14,409 --> 01:39:18,704
<i>And I live under the ground.</i>

756
01:39:19,291 --> 01:39:24,477
<i>To your heart, I offer</i>

757
01:39:24,478 --> 01:39:29,064
<i>my fang and my sting.</i>

758
01:39:39,821 --> 01:39:45,216
<i>I am the serpent
of the night.</i>

759
01:39:45,217 --> 01:39:50,325
<i>Your soul is my home.</i>

760
01:39:50,326 --> 01:39:55,499
<i>I steal your head
and leave you</i>

761
01:39:55,500 --> 01:40:00,934
<i>with your eyes
that see nothing.</i>

762
01:40:10,787 --> 01:40:16,055
<i>I am the serpent
of the night.</i>

763
01:40:16,056 --> 01:40:21,166
<i>Your body is my shelter.</i>

764
01:40:21,167 --> 01:40:26,276
<i>Your blind eye
I give to you.</i>

765
01:40:26,277 --> 01:40:31,715
<i>The head, I take with me.</i>

766
01:43:02,316 --> 01:43:04,495
Son.

767
01:43:27,179 --> 01:43:28,956
Father.
