1
00:00:07,217 --> 00:00:07,773
Quill.

2
00:00:08,526 --> 00:00:09,450
Check.

3
00:00:10,602 --> 00:00:11,465
Parchment.

4
00:00:11,463 --> 00:00:12,196
Check.

5
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:13,020
Extra ink.

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:13,540
Check.

7
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:14,949
Extra-extra ink.

8
00:00:14,946 --> 00:00:15,871
Check.

9
00:00:16,165 --> 00:00:17,822
Is that everything on the checklist?

10
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,153
-Yep!
-Great.

11
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:22,485
Now that we've completed the checklist
of things we need to create a checklist...

12
00:00:22,475 --> 00:00:25,937
...we can make my checklist of the things
I have to get done by the end of the day.

13
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,216
Ready?

14
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,400
Ready!

15
00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:32,770
Item 1: Create checklist of the things
I have to accomplish by the end of the day.

16
00:01:18,706 --> 00:01:19,737
How are we doing, Spike?

17
00:01:19,984 --> 00:01:21,120
Let's see...

18
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:22,910
We've already dropped off
your cape at the cleaner's...

19
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:24,901
...returned the blackboard
you borrowed from Cheerilee...

20
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:27,337
...ordered new parchment and quills
from the stationery shop...

21
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:30,818
Hmm... Seems like we just placed
an order for those a few days ago.

22
00:01:32,146 --> 00:01:34,898
Can imagine why we go
through so many of them.

23
00:01:35,106 --> 00:01:37,944
Sounds like we're ahead
of schedule. What's next?

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,936
Cupcakes!

25
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,215
Uh, I only ordered twelve.

26
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,641
Oh, I know, dear.

27
00:01:47,637 --> 00:01:51,244
But I had an extra, so I though
I'd make it a baker's dozen.

28
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:55,041
Oh, that was very thoughtful of you.

29
00:01:55,037 --> 00:01:57,554
It's just some of the icing
from the extra cupcake...

30
00:01:57,547 --> 00:02:00,440
...is getting all over
the one next to it. See?

31
00:02:02,102 --> 00:02:03,820
Oh! Sure.

32
00:02:03,816 --> 00:02:06,176
It's just that I'm planning on
sharing these at a picnic later...

33
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,726
...and I don't want anypony to feel like
somepony else is getting more icing.

34
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:13,421
Oh... no, of course not.

35
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:15,029
Not to worry.

36
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:17,258
I'll just move some of this one to...

37
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,581
Hmm... I think I may have
scooped too much.

38
00:02:20,698 --> 00:02:22,843
Oops! Now those two have more.

39
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:24,773
Let's just try this again.

40
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,319
Hmm... No, that won't do.

41
00:02:29,587 --> 00:02:32,626
Let me just... hmm...
put some here, then...

44
00:02:41,758 --> 00:02:42,822
Perfect!

45
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:46,312
Hmm, oh yes. Much better.

46
00:02:46,305 --> 00:02:49,096
Okay! Time to tackle
the next item on our...

47
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:50,209
Oops!

48
00:02:50,207 --> 00:02:54,083
Looks like we're gonna have to add
"Give a baby dragon a bath" to our list.

49
00:02:57,883 --> 00:03:01,506
Very efficient! And a little bit gross.

50
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,317
Looks like that's everything.

51
00:03:04,503 --> 00:03:06,226
Almost everything.

52
00:03:06,222 --> 00:03:09,741
"Triple-check checklist to make sure
we didn't miss anything..."

53
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,142
"...when the double-checked
the checklist".

54
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,843
Uh, check.

55
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:19,164
I've been holding that quill so long
I've got a claw cramp.

56
00:03:20,255 --> 00:03:23,643
Good thing we don't have anything
to report to Princess Celestia this week.

57
00:03:23,634 --> 00:03:25,663
I don't think I can write another word.

58
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,746
We haven't sent a letter
to Princess Celestia this week?!

59
00:03:28,738 --> 00:03:30,349
Why? Is that bad?

60
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:32,687
Bad?! BAD?! Of course it's bad!

61
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:35,283
I'm supposed to send Princess
Celestia a letter every week...

62
00:03:35,276 --> 00:03:37,383
...telling her about a lesson
I've learned about friendship!

63
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:39,759
Not every other week.
Not every ten days.

64
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,085
Every! Single! Week!

65
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:45,945
Where's my calendar?!
Where's my calendar?!

66
00:03:45,938 --> 00:03:48,332
Where it always is?

67
00:03:49,193 --> 00:03:51,203
When did we send the last one?

68
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:53,438
Last Tuesday?

69
00:03:53,592 --> 00:03:55,764
And today is...

70
00:03:56,283 --> 00:03:57,262
Tuesday?

71
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:00,216
Nonononononono...

72
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:04,193
If I don't send her a letter
by sundown, I'll be...

73
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,056
TARDY!!!

74
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:09,130
What's that now?

75
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:12,151
Tar-dy, Spike. Late! I'll be late!

76
00:04:12,343 --> 00:04:15,956
Oh, how could I've let this happen?
I'm usually so organized.

77
00:04:15,946 --> 00:04:17,933
I've never been late for an assignment.

78
00:04:17,927 --> 00:04:20,788
Oh, please! You're the most
studious student ever.

79
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:24,218
I'm sure the princess will forgive you
if you miss one little deadline.

80
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,312
I'm afraid to take that chance, Spike.

81
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:29,368
This is the ruler of all of Equestria
we're talking about.

82
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:31,817
The pony who holds
my fate in her hooves.

83
00:04:32,988 --> 00:04:34,376
What if she doesn't forgive me?

84
00:04:34,372 --> 00:04:36,113
Yeah, I don't think she...

85
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:37,489
What if instead she starts thinking...

86
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,141
...I'm not taking my studies
on friendship seriously?

87
00:04:40,135 --> 00:04:40,774
Why would she...

88
00:04:40,773 --> 00:04:43,399
What if she makes me come back to
Canterlot and puts me back in school...

89
00:04:43,392 --> 00:04:47,044
...and makes me *prove* I've been
taking them seriously by giving me a task?

90
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,947
What if I don't pass?!

91
00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:51,835
-But why wouldn't you pass...
-She's my teacher!

92
00:04:51,828 --> 00:04:54,905
Do you know what teachers do
to students who don't pass?

93
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,125
THEY SEND THEM BACK A GRADE!

94
00:04:58,119 --> 00:04:59,758
But she won't just send me back a grade.

95
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:01,493
She'll send me back to...

96
00:05:02,032 --> 00:05:04,065
...magic kindergarten.

97
00:05:10,997 --> 00:05:12,168
Twilight.

98
00:05:12,942 --> 00:05:14,215
Twilight!

99
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:17,688
That is the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard!

100
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,626
You're not gonna be sent back
to magic kindergarten.

101
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:23,634
You're right. I have no reason to worry.

102
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:25,921
Because I'm going to solve
a friend's problem...

103
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:29,516
...and get that letter to Princess
Celestia before sundown!

104
00:05:30,314 --> 00:05:31,714
So...

105
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:34,067
Got any problems, troubles, conundrums
or any other sort of issues...

106
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:37,667
...major or minor, that I as a good
friend could help you solve?

107
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:44,434
I got nothin'.

108
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:49,656
Then it looks like I'm gonna have to
find somepony who does.

109
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:53,131
This won't end well.

110
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,064
You've got this, Twilight.

111
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:02,521
You still have plenty of time to
get that letter to Princess Celestia.

112
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:06,184
Has to be somepony around here
who needs the help of a good friend.

113
00:06:07,572 --> 00:06:08,855
Rarity!

114
00:06:12,254 --> 00:06:15,394
Don't worry, Rarity! I'm here!

115
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:17,989
Why me?

116
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:20,964
WHY, WHY, WHY?!

117
00:06:20,955 --> 00:06:23,430
Of all the worst things
that could happen...

118
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:27,431
...this is the! Worst! Possible! Thing!

119
00:06:29,183 --> 00:06:31,418
What's happened?! Are you all right?

120
00:06:31,868 --> 00:06:35,401
I've lost my diamond
encrusted purple ribbon!

121
00:06:35,392 --> 00:06:38,074
I have searched HIGH!
And I have searched low.

122
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:39,778
LOW AND HIGH!
High and low.

123
00:06:40,554 --> 00:06:42,318
But I can't find it anywhere!

124
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:45,362
ANYWHERE!

125
00:06:45,882 --> 00:06:50,204
How can I possibly finish
my latest creation if I can't find it?

126
00:06:50,388 --> 00:06:54,018
Never fear, Rarity. As your friend
I'll do my best to help you fi...

127
00:06:54,008 --> 00:06:55,389
Oh, there it is.

128
00:06:55,385 --> 00:06:58,259
Isn't it always just
the last place you look.

129
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:03,168
So you just lost your ribbon...

130
00:07:04,912 --> 00:07:06,950
...but now you've found it.

131
00:07:06,945 --> 00:07:07,927
Yeah.

132
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:10,410
And nothing else is bothering you?

133
00:07:10,402 --> 00:07:14,030
Nothing that I as a good friend
could help you with?

134
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:17,866
There is one thing.

135
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,252
YES?!

136
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,558
I think I've left my measuring tape
under the fabric over there.

137
00:07:21,552 --> 00:07:23,223
Could you get that for me?

138
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:28,036
Measuring tape. Sure.

139
00:07:28,358 --> 00:07:30,913
Twilight. Is there something bother...

140
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:33,059
Twilight.

141
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,152
No need to panic.
Rarity is just one pony.

142
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:42,523
I'm sure one of my other
friends will need me.

143
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,272
What in the world...

144
00:08:03,113 --> 00:08:05,716
Rainbow must be angry with Applejack!

145
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:09,170
She must hate her guts. Oh, wonderful!

146
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:11,934
Rainbow Dash! Stop!

147
00:08:13,096 --> 00:08:17,493
Listen, Rainbow. I know you're upset
with Applejack, but don't worry.

148
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,686
Whatever it is that has
come between you two...

149
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,477
...I'm sure that I as a good friend
can help you resolve your problems.

150
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:27,993
Uh, what are you talking about?

151
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:29,885
Oh, Rainbow Dash.

152
00:08:29,881 --> 00:08:32,023
You don't have to hide
your feelings from me.

153
00:08:32,016 --> 00:08:34,853
I can tell you two must
have had a terrible fight.

154
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,695
Now, why don't you tell me all
about your issues with Applejack?

155
00:08:39,682 --> 00:08:41,876
I don't have any issues with Applejack.

156
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:45,356
You don't? Then why are you
destroying her property?

157
00:08:45,346 --> 00:08:46,878
Because she asked me to.

158
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:48,241
Right, Applejack?

159
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:49,431
Yes, ma'am.

160
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,954
I wanted to put up a new barn, but
this one's gotta come down first.

161
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,883
Now get back to it, RD.

162
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:57,047
You got it, boss!

163
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,161
I'd take cover if I were you.

164
00:09:24,948 --> 00:09:27,514
I can't believe I've
wasted all that time.

165
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:29,342
I should have just come here first.

166
00:09:29,337 --> 00:09:32,128
Fluttershy always has some fear
she's trying to get over.

167
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:35,234
As a good friend
I'll be able to help her.

168
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:48,516
Fluttershy?!

169
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,709
How can this be happening?!

170
00:09:57,705 --> 00:10:01,234
Of all the days she had to stop being such
a scaredy-pony she had to pick today?!

171
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,504
What am I going to do?

172
00:10:04,365 --> 00:10:06,706
You really should have
come to me sooner.

173
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,200
You were carrying so much
tension in that shoulder.

174
00:10:14,076 --> 00:10:17,998
It's fine. It'll all be fine.
Today isn't over yet.

175
00:10:17,986 --> 00:10:19,534
But it will be over soon!

176
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:25,819
It'll be all over! My time in Ponyville,
my advanced studies...

177
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:29,148
No, no. You're a good student.
You can do this.

178
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,414
Oh! But what if I can't?

179
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:33,528
You can! You just
have to keep it together.

180
00:10:33,522 --> 00:10:35,274
Keep! It! Together!

181
00:10:35,961 --> 00:10:38,568
Are you talking to... yourself?

182
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:40,813
Twilight?

183
00:10:49,718 --> 00:10:51,149
SNAP OUT OF IT!

184
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:52,691
Huh?

185
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,397
Are you okay?

186
00:10:57,558 --> 00:10:59,425
Twilight, I'm really worried.

187
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,706
I mean this letter thing
is really getting to you.

188
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:02,543
Here.

189
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,841
You've been so anxious all day that
you've completely forgot about the picnic.

190
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,115
Why don't you just relax
and go hang out with...

191
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,202
The picnic!

192
00:11:10,113 --> 00:11:12,126
I should go see my friends!

193
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:14,439
I'm glad you've come to your senses.

194
00:11:22,988 --> 00:11:26,115
Please tell me I did not forget the plates.

195
00:11:26,223 --> 00:11:28,328
I did! I totally forgot them!

196
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:31,412
Of all the worst things
that could happen, this is...

197
00:11:31,405 --> 00:11:34,763
The! Worst! Possible! Thing!

198
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:39,511
Why, why, why!

199
00:11:41,604 --> 00:11:42,566
What?

200
00:11:42,564 --> 00:11:45,218
You didn't expect me to
lay on the grass, did you?

201
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,160
You all right, hun?

202
00:11:55,157 --> 00:11:55,826
NO!

203
00:11:55,824 --> 00:11:57,537
I am not all right.

204
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,719
It's just terrible.

205
00:12:02,203 --> 00:12:03,189
Yes?

206
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:04,767
Simply awful.

207
00:12:05,062 --> 00:12:06,255
Yes?

208
00:12:06,252 --> 00:12:08,027
It's the most terrific trouble
I've ever been in...

209
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:10,977
...and I really, really,
really need your help!

210
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:12,615
YES?

211
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:15,661
My letter to Princess Celestia
is almost overdue.

212
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:18,622
And I haven't learned
anything about friendship!

213
00:12:20,587 --> 00:12:23,809
Oh, thank goodness. I thought
something really awful had happened.

214
00:12:26,295 --> 00:12:28,314
Something awful HAS happened!

215
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,499
If I don't turn in the letter
on time, I'll be tardy!

216
00:12:33,014 --> 00:12:34,747
TAAARDY!

217
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:40,398
No offense, sugar cube...

218
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:43,942
...but it looks like somepony's gettin'
themselves all worked up over nothin'.

219
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:47,036
This is not nothing.
This is everything!

220
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:50,714
I need you guys to help me find somepony
with a problem I can fix before sundown.

221
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:53,343
MY WHOLE LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!

222
00:12:54,103 --> 00:12:56,889
Oh, Twilight. You're such a crackup.

223
00:12:58,316 --> 00:12:59,468
Come on, now.

224
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:01,757
Have a seat and stop
sweatin' small stuff.

225
00:13:05,547 --> 00:13:08,880
Wow. I've never seen
Twilight so upset before.

226
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,714
Ugh, what a drama queen.

227
00:13:13,032 --> 00:13:14,925
Relatively speaking.

228
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,371
Clock is ticking, Twilight.

229
00:13:20,672 --> 00:13:22,787
Clock... is... ticking!

230
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,640
Keep it together.

231
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:28,948
If I can't find a friendship problem...

232
00:13:29,737 --> 00:13:31,826
...I'll *make* a friendship problem!

233
00:13:50,382 --> 00:13:52,234
Hai, gurls!

234
00:13:53,204 --> 00:13:55,454
Oh. Hi, Twilight. How's it goi..

235
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:57,728
Guh-reat! Just great!

236
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:00,118
You three look like
you're doing great too!

237
00:14:00,113 --> 00:14:01,808
Looks like three good
friends who obviously...

238
00:14:01,804 --> 00:14:04,928
...don't need the help
of another good friend!

239
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:08,559
This is Smarty Pants.

240
00:14:08,554 --> 00:14:10,378
She was mine when I was your age.

241
00:14:10,374 --> 00:14:12,777
And now I want to give her to you!

242
00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:17,047
Uh... She's... great!

243
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,595
Yeah... Great.

244
00:14:19,588 --> 00:14:23,793
I really like her... mane?

245
00:14:23,782 --> 00:14:27,300
She even comes with
her own notebook and quill.

246
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,583
For when you want to pretend
she's doing her homework.

247
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:34,373
That's, um... great.

248
00:14:34,364 --> 00:14:37,052
Yeah... Great.

249
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:41,850
I really like her... mane?

250
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,359
I just hope the fact that
there are three of you...

251
00:14:44,353 --> 00:14:47,113
...and only one of her
doesn't become a problem.

252
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:50,521
I'd hate to cause a rift
between such good friends!

253
00:14:51,738 --> 00:14:53,418
So who wants to play with her first?

254
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:56,342
Uh... You should play
with her first, Sweetie Belle.

255
00:14:56,336 --> 00:14:58,692
You know, cause you
like her mane so much.

256
00:14:59,076 --> 00:15:00,408
Nononononono.

257
00:15:00,405 --> 00:15:03,715
I think Scootaloo should
get to play with her first.

258
00:15:03,706 --> 00:15:06,862
I'd love to, but, um...
You take her, Apple Bloom.

259
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:10,410
Applejack says it's important to share.

260
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,948
I got to think of something.
Thinkthinkthink, Twilight, think!

261
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:15,752
That's it!

262
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,909
Ooh, you're going to like Smarty Pants.

263
00:15:18,902 --> 00:15:21,531
And you're going to like her
more than anything.

264
00:15:30,393 --> 00:15:31,777
I want it.

265
00:15:31,773 --> 00:15:33,705
I need it.

266
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:35,962
I really like her mane!

267
00:15:38,651 --> 00:15:41,417
The "want it, need it" spell.
Works every time.

268
00:15:41,771 --> 00:15:43,875
Okay, okay. Let's break it up.

269
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,408
I think you can all see that
there is an important lesson...

270
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,867
...to be learned here about...

271
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:51,941
Come on, girls. We're all friends here, right?

272
00:15:52,037 --> 00:15:53,672
Don't you think you have to share?

273
00:15:54,498 --> 00:15:55,740
No way!

274
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,696
Big McIntosh! Thank goodness!

275
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,630
You gotta help me get that
doll away from those girls.

276
00:16:07,844 --> 00:16:09,536
Eeyup.

277
00:16:16,463 --> 00:16:20,283
Thank you so much. Now if
you could just give her to me...

278
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:22,156
Nnnope.

279
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:24,528
Oh no!

280
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:30,503
What's all the commotion about?

281
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:32,090
They're fighting over that doll!

282
00:16:32,086 --> 00:16:35,016
That incredible, amazing doll!

283
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:39,743
Can't get a clear shot...

284
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:45,690
Give me!

285
00:16:50,082 --> 00:16:51,387
Nnnope.

286
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,760
Oh, what have I done?!

287
00:17:01,257 --> 00:17:02,650
Y'all hear that?

288
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,187
What in the name of all things
oats 'n apples is goin' on here?

289
00:17:16,813 --> 00:17:19,295
-DON'T LOOK AT IT!
-Don't look at what?

290
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,776
My Smarty Pants doll.

291
00:17:20,772 --> 00:17:23,861
I enchanted her and now
everypony is fighting over her.

292
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:26,734
Why would you enchant your doll?

293
00:17:26,728 --> 00:17:28,107
Oh, I had to do something!

294
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:30,305
I had nothing to report to Princess Celestia.

295
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,658
I thought if I couldn't find
a problem, I'd make a problem.

296
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:35,578
The day is almost over!

297
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,374
Not almost.

298
00:17:43,655 --> 00:17:45,519
Twilight Sparkle!

299
00:17:48,514 --> 00:17:50,273
Whoa, Nelly.

300
00:18:19,972 --> 00:18:22,340
Meet me in the library.

301
00:18:24,392 --> 00:18:27,540
Goodbye, girls. If you care to visit...

302
00:18:28,028 --> 00:18:32,064
...I'll be in magic kindergarten
back in Canterlot.

303
00:18:33,793 --> 00:18:36,683
-Magic kindergarten?
-Canterlot?

304
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,012
We're never gonna see Twilight again!

305
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,394
What are we gonna do, y'all?

306
00:18:42,427 --> 00:18:45,137
Of all the worst things
that could happen...

307
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:49,387
...this is the! Worst! Possible! Thing!

308
00:18:53,074 --> 00:18:55,972
What? I really mean it this time.

309
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:01,592
But... But... I'm supposed to send you
a letter about friendship every week.

310
00:19:01,806 --> 00:19:03,115
I missed the deadline.

311
00:19:03,113 --> 00:19:06,798
I'm a bad student. I'm tardy!

312
00:19:06,907 --> 00:19:09,483
You are a wonderful student, Twilight.

313
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:12,285
I don't have to get a letter
every week to know that.

314
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:13,691
Really?

315
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,016
WAIT!

316
00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:18,338
You can't punish her!

317
00:19:18,335 --> 00:19:19,731
It wasn't her fault!

318
00:19:19,728 --> 00:19:20,938
I'm listening.

319
00:19:20,935 --> 00:19:23,674
Please, your highness.
We all saw that Twilight was upset.

320
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:25,822
But we thought that the thing
she was worrying about...

321
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:27,688
...wasn't worth worrying about.

322
00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:29,577
So when she ran out all worked up...

323
00:19:29,571 --> 00:19:31,814
...not a single one of us
tried to stop her.

324
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:34,358
As Twilight's good friends,
we should have taken...

325
00:19:34,351 --> 00:19:37,023
...her feelings seriously
and been there for her.

326
00:19:37,016 --> 00:19:38,828
Please don't take her away from us...

327
00:19:38,823 --> 00:19:41,630
...just because we were
too insensitive to help her.

328
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:47,407
Looks like you all learned
a pretty valuable lesson today.

329
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:54,635
Very well. I'll forget Twilight's
punishment on one condition.

330
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,361
From this day forth
I would like you all...

331
00:19:59,357 --> 00:20:02,514
...to report to me your findings
on the magic of friendship.

332
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:05,555
When and only when you happen to discover them.

333
00:20:09,615 --> 00:20:11,539
Princess Celestia! Wait!

334
00:20:11,534 --> 00:20:13,555
How did you know I was in trouble?

335
00:20:13,649 --> 00:20:15,171
Your friend Spike made me aware...

336
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:17,545
...that you were letting
your fears get the best of you.

337
00:20:17,538 --> 00:20:20,605
I commend him for taking
your feelings seriously.

338
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:24,473
Now, if you will all excuse me,
I must return to Canterlot.

339
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:26,907
I'm expecting some mail.

340
00:20:31,153 --> 00:20:34,464
Y'all heard the princess.
Spike, take a letter.

341
00:20:40,749 --> 00:20:43,480
"Dear Princess Celestia.
We're writin' to you..."

342
00:20:43,472 --> 00:20:46,393
"...because today we all learned
a little somethin' about friendship."

343
00:20:46,385 --> 00:20:49,580
"We learned that you should take
your friends' worries seriously."

344
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:52,611
"Even if you don't think that
she has anything to worry about."

345
00:20:52,602 --> 00:20:55,845
"And that you shouldn't let
your worries turn a small problem..."

346
00:20:55,836 --> 00:20:59,096
"...into an enormously huge
entire-town-in-total-chaos..."

347
00:20:59,088 --> 00:21:01,807
"...Princess-has-to-come-
-and-save-the-day problem."

348
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,635
"Signed, your loyal subjects."

349
00:21:06,036 --> 00:21:08,986
"PS. Obviously Spike did not
have to learn a lesson..."

350
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:12,372
"...because he is the best, most
awesome friend a pony could ask for."

351
00:21:12,362 --> 00:21:15,750
"Unlike everypony else,
he took things seriously. And..."

352
00:21:18,073 --> 00:21:19,575
Uh... Yeah.

353
00:21:19,572 --> 00:21:21,155
I'll just, um...
