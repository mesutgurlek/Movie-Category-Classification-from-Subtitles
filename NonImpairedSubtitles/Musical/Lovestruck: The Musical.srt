And after the wedding I want
to stay in Italy with him.

70
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:41,954
Pumpkin, we go on
in three weeks.
You can't stay in Italy.

his idea, isn't it?

No. We made the decision
together.

discuss it with me.

through these bags.

Not one of you
has any aspirin?

yourselves dancers?

is still out of aspirin.

you threw him out.

Whatever dad
did or didn't do--

91
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,410
There wasn't much
he didn't do.

I'm not gonna let you
ruin your life

By trading in your dreams

94

For some ridiculous
fairy tale in Italy.

95

I want the fairy tale!

He's left that all behind.
He promised.

110
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:43,875
Promises. What about
the promise you made to me

Amanda.

224
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,452
Who's this?

225
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:15,854
It's me.
<i>Harper?</i>

226
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,355
Are you okay?

227
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,123
You sound weird.
<i>Ahem.</i>

228
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,959
Ahem! My throat is
a little swollen.

229
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,627
I must have caught
something on the flight.

230
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,529
How's the knee?
<i>It's, um...</i>

231
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,098
Better. A lot better,
actually.

232
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,366
That tonic really
did the trick.

233
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:32,303
One of the dancers found it
here in the theater. Why?

234
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:35,139
I had the tiniest,
sort of miniscule,
you know...

235
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,207
Harper.

236
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,642
Reaction.

237
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,011
What kind of reaction?
Are you sick?

238
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,313
I am definitely feeling
very strange right now.

239
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,948
You should go
to the doctor.

240
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,317
Amanda, I am fine.
I'm fine. I just--

241
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,887
I need you to figure out
where this stuff came from.

242
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:52,056
<i>I'll see what I can do,</i>
<i>but you need to come home</i>
<i>right now. We need to find</i>

243
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,058
A replacement
for mirabella <i>today.</i>

244
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,561
Yeah. I came here
to convince mirabella

245
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,564
That marco is not worth
giving up her career for.

246
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:03,167
And now I know
how to prove it.

247
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:05,970
What are you going to do?
<i>I'm going to seduce marco.</i>

248
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,539
<i>You're going to seduce</i>
<i>the playboy prince?</i>

249
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:12,343
I'm going to show her
that lover boy here
isn't cut out to keep promises.

250
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:13,912
Just find out what you can
about that tonic

251
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,513
<i>And call me back.</i>

252
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,541
Excuse me, sir.

253
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:46,344
I'll have you know that
I'm an almost-married woman.

254
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:50,114
Oh, that's all right,
I'm an almost-married man.

255
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:54,686
And this is how you choose
to spend your last few
precious hours of freedom?

256
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:57,355
Hours?
I only need five minutes.

257
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:58,523
Ew!
( both laughing )

258
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:01,192
What do we have here?

259
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:02,961
Put that down!
No, no!

260
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,629
In a marriage
there are no secrets.

261
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,465
We're not married yet!
Not for a couple of days.

262
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,467
So we do have secrets!
You started your novel?

263
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,602
No!
Oh, great!

264
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,705
Like father, like daughter.
No!

265
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:18,109
He's not a novelist.
He teaches comparative
literature at nyu.

266
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:22,313
Besides, I'm gonna stay in bed
with you all day
and have six kids. Stop!

267
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,348
They're my vows.

268
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,649
Sorry. Sorry.

269
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:28,152
Hmm. So...

270
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,388
How are yours coming along?
Great!

271
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,457
I mean, that's really
important to you, right?

272
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:35,126
That we both
write our own?

273
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:38,162
Yes.
It's very important.
It's the <i>most</i> important.

274
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,199
It's the one chance we have
to stand up in front
of everybody

275
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:46,004
And say how we really
feel about each other,
speak from our hearts.

276
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:49,507
And I do love you
with all my heart.

Seating emergency.
Total disaster. Come quick.

296
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:56,140

I'm gonna change.

Young harper:
Am I in the right place?

Surprise!

302
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,858
And--and you are?

303
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,827
You don't remember me?

304
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:20,331
Debbie hayworth.
Second cousin once removed.

305
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,334
Aunt marjorie's side?
Ohh. Okay,

306
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:26,571
Your grandmother
and my great-uncle--

307
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,106
I'm sorry,
too many details.

308
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,141
You must be on
my mother's list.

309
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,810
We played together
all the time as kids.

310
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:36,781
Remember the treehouse
uncle eddie built in
the back of the barn?

311
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,850
Of--of course!
The old treehouse!

312
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:41,652
God, it's been forever.
You look so...

313
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:47,291
So much like my mother
when she was young.

314
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,127
Really?

315
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:52,430
Yeah,
the spitting image.
It's weird.

It's <i>really</i> weird.

00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:58,469
Aunt marjorie always
said the same thing.
And--and I said,

318
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,304
"well, if I have to
look like somebody,

319
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,839
I'm so glad
it's aunt harper."

320
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,175
I mean, is she just
a timeless beauty, or what?

321
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:06,410
And--and so talented.

322
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:09,180
Aunt marjorie always
called her "superstar."

323
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:10,915
I really hate to break up
the family reunion,

324
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,351
But we have
a rehearsal dinner
nightmare on our hands.

325
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,786
See?
Oh, gosh, these
italian family feuds.

326
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,555
They last for 700 years.

327
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:19,490
And I don't know where I'm gonna
put my great-aunt birdie.

328
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,259
She came in
all the way from boston.

329
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:25,196
Interesting color scheme.
Is that...Puce?

330
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:27,398
Bold choice.

331
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,667
I thought your mom said
you were going with

332
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,203
Dusky rose
and gold accents.

333
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:34,205
No, that's what her mom
<i>wanted</i> her to go with.

334
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:36,174
Pink and gold are classics.

335
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,241
Old-fashioned.

336
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,210
Tasteful.
Boring.

337
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,316
Oh, my gosh!

338
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,885
Debbie,
you fixed it!
Thank you!

339
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:51,289
Oh! You have <i>got</i> to come
to my bachelorette party.

340
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,823
Bachelorette party?

341
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:56,227
Oh, yeah, we're family.
You have to come.

342
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,596
We have champagne
and mani-pedi's.
Mani-pedi's.

343
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:00,331
Yay!
Yay!

344
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,600
Well, I'll get
settled in, then.

345
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:03,901
Okay.
All right.
All right.

346
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:06,871
We'll see you
for mani-pedi's.

347
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,573
All: Mani-pedi's!

348
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,410
Amanda!

349
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,612
The tonic.
What have you got?

350
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:17,215
We have a bigger problem.

351
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:20,218
I spoke to the investors.

352
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,686
Amanda, the tonic.

353
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:23,487
Harper, this is serious.

354
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,923
You need to come home
right now. I can't do this.

355
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:30,361
I am in a situation here,
amanda. I need information.

356
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,230
What kind of situation?
How crazy

357
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,732
<i>Is it over there?</i>

358
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:35,933
( camera snaps )

359
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,405
I'd say it's getting
pretty crazy, don't you think?

360
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,974
Who's that?
She looks familiar.

361
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:44,809
Are you in my office?
What?

362
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:47,345
<i>Look around.</i>
<i>( sighs )</i>

363
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,256
Aaaaah!

364
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,790
<i>Amanda!</i>

365
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,261
<i>Amanda.</i>

366
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,263
Amanda?

367
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,998
Who is this?

368
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,500
It's <i>me,</i> amanda!
Now focus! The tonic!

369
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:13,371
No, you're not.
That is impossible.

370
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,939
You have worked
for me for 15 years.

371
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,307
<i>We have mounted</i>

372
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:17,441
22 productions together,
and turned

373
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,310
<i>Three unknowns</i>
<i>into broadway stars.</i>

374
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:23,014
And help me figure out
what is in this tonic
that turned me young,

375
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:25,816
I will fire you
without hesitation or regret!

376
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:26,984
Now pull yourself together!

377
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:31,289
Oh, my god. It <i>is</i> you.

378
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,025
Thank you.
What have you got?

379
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:35,693
<i>Um...</i>

380
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:39,063
Oh, god. The stuff
is really old, harper.

381
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:40,998
It was used for

382
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,301
<i>Rheumatism, gout, um...</i>

383
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:45,936
Melancholia, and impotence.

384
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,538
What about side effects?

385
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,473
Well, I've already
looked online.

386
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,776
The company's been
out of business
for decades.

387
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:02,653
Find out: Does it wear off,
and if so, can I take more.
You got it? Find out.

388
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,539
( exhales )

389
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,342
The things I do
for my daughter.

390
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,115
Hi.

391
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:32,516
Hello.

392
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,884
Debbie hayworth.

393
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,386
Marco vitturi.

394
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:38,789
You must be related to
mirabella. You look like her.

395
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,859
She looks like me.
We're second cousins.

396
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,095
Once removed.
Aunt marjorie's side.

397
00:22:44,097 --> 00:22:45,730
Right. Listen to this.

398
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,498
"dear mirabella,

399
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,600
"you are so beautiful.

400
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:53,104
"I want to never sleep
or even blink again

401
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:57,742
"just so I can stare at
your beautifulness forever...

402
00:22:57,744 --> 00:22:59,977
Until I die."

403
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:02,480
Too over the top?

404
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:06,050
Wow. That is, um...
Yeah, that's really bad.

405
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,919
It's terrible.

406
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:12,123
But it was mirabella's idea
for us to write our own vows
for the wedding,

407
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,125
And...I don't know,

408
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:16,794
I have no idea
what I'm gonna say.

409
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:19,630
Looks to me like
you can't <i>stop</i> figuring out
what to say.

410
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:21,031
True enough.

411
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:24,902
Love can make you
a little crazy sometimes.

412
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,405
That's not your reputation,
you know.

413
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,140
Yeah. I know.

414
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:32,076
Must be really hard
to give that up.

415
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:35,413
Not really.

416
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:39,116
Mirabella must be
very special to you.
Oh, she is.

417
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:41,118
She has this--

418
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,521
I mean, she's so--

419
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:47,458
When we first met,
I was like--

420
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,127
Oh, god.

421
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:52,062
She's--everything.

422
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,199
So it's kind of hard,
you know, to--

423
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,770
She has <i>the</i> most
beautiful blue eyes.

424
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,473
Yeah. Yeah,
she got those
from her dad.

425
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:07,044
And this beautiful smile
where one side of her mouth
kind of turns up--

426
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:10,147
Kind of like yours.
Think she's got a secret?

427
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:14,852
Yeah, right.
Something, uh...Secret.

428
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:18,489
Oh, and she--she has
these beautiful hands.

429
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:20,925
Oh, dancer's hands.

430
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:24,061
You're...A dancer too?

431
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:26,030
Runs in the family.

432
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,703
I'm--I'm sorry, have--
have we met before?

433
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:35,773
Not in this lifetime.

434
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:38,576
Are you sure? Because--
oh, I'm sure.

435
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:41,979
You would definitely
remember meeting me.

436
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:45,683
You know, for second cousins,
you and mirabella...

437
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:49,086
Yes?
It's strange how much
you remind me of her.

438
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,864
This is so going to work.

439
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,071
Noelle, how many times
did you lose your virginity?

440
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,773
I have no idea, but hey,

441
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:13,143
If the stars align
I might lose it again
this weekend.

442
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:15,513
( laughter )

443
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:18,682
Seriously though, em,
you're so lucky to have
found a guy like marco.

444
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,852
He's so hot and rich...

445
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:25,756
And hot and rich! Hello!

446
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:27,057
Okay, mirabella,
it's your turn.

447
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,226
Oh, no.
Somebody else go.

448
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:31,161
But your story's so good.

449
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:33,531
Okay. She was 16 years old,

450
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:36,000
She told her mom
she was spending the weekend
at a friend's house--

451
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:37,735
I'm that friend,
that influence--
and instead,

452
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:41,105
We snuck off to paris!
What?!

453
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:44,141
I mean, wow.

454
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:47,144
And there,
after staying up all night

455
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,979
Walking the banks of the seine
hand in hand,

456
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,282
Talking until sunrise,

457
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:53,150
Whispering their life stories
to each other--

458
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,953
Noelle, no!
You have got
to be kidding me.

459
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:58,989
Our dear, sweet,
innocent mirabella

460
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:03,327
Laid herself down
with that hot, sexy
french man

461
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:07,064
And gave up
her precious flower.
At sixteen?!

462
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,966
It was very romantic.

463
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:11,635
By the end of the night
we knew everything
about each other

464
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,904
And we were like
two ships passing.

465
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,307
And he was really very sweet.
Wait a second.

466
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:20,044
How the heck did you
get out of the country
without your mother knowing?

467
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:22,179
Her mom was at
an out-of-town preview.

468
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:24,648
Her dad gave us permission.
We told him it was
a class trip.

469
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,584
My mom didn't even
notice I was gone.

470
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:29,587
Okay, that is not fair.
She's a very busy woman.

471
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,755
A single mom,
a demanding career--

472
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,992
Debbie, my mom is, was,
and always will be

473
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:37,928
Way too self-centered
to think about anybody
but herself.

474
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:41,932
She took you to dance classes
three times a week
when you were a kid.

475
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,341
Noelle:
What are you <i>doing?</i>

476
00:26:50,343 --> 00:26:52,309
The sun is very bad
for your skin.

477
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:55,679
So, mirabella, tell me
about this french guy.

478
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,281
Did you think
you were in love with him?

479
00:26:57,283 --> 00:27:00,818
Okay, uh, no.
I mean, it was
a great experience,

480
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,053
But it wasn't like
how it is with marco.

481
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:06,657
Right. Marco.
The playboy prince.

482
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:10,194
I'm sorry. I just--
I read that.

483
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:13,263
He retired that title
when he met me. Besides,
he's not a real prince.

484
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:16,033
( laughter )
but he is a real italian.

485
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:18,235
I wouldn't worry too much
about that, though.

486
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:21,405
Not every italian guy
has to have a mistress,
right?

487
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:24,074
Right?
I'm not worried about it.

488
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:28,245
I knew marco was the right guy
right from the very beginning.

And now the not-so-good news.

537
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:14,812
The investors found out about
mirabella leaving the show.

00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:17,447
Oh, no! How?!
<i>One of the dancers</i>

539
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:19,116
Spilled, and it gets worse.

540
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:21,185
They're going to recast her.

541
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:22,920
They can't do that.
<i>Yes,</i>

542
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,421
They can. Look,

543
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:25,989
<i>I told the investors</i>

544
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,391
<i>Mirabella'd be back</i>
<i>for rehearsal on Monday,</i>

545
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:29,827
But if mirabella is not
back here for it,

546
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:32,996
They're going to replace her.
And you.

547
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,933
We don't need a new lead.
Mirabella is coming back.

( laughing )
whoo!

549
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:39,169
And they wouldn't dare
replace me.

Why am I scared?

551
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:42,039
Don't say anything to anybody.

Debbie, mirabella dared me
to be a better person,
and I thought I could.

574
00:32:22,675 --> 00:32:25,342
Because she believed in me
more than anyone has

575
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,444
In my entire life.

576
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,950
But now this?

577
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:36,987
I don't think I can be

00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:39,156
Or the man she deserves.

579
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,961
I'm not good enough
for her. Right?

580
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,633
I'm sorry, debbie,
this isn't your fault.
It's mine.

581
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,702
I have to go.

Oh! This is it.

583
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:20,464
Can you believe
I'm getting married tomorrow?

584
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:22,733
No, I really can't.

585
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,137
Debbie, what's wrong?

586
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:29,039
Nothing. Nothing.

587
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:32,075
I'm fine, it's just
this is the first time
I've seen you in your dress.

588
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:36,213
It seems like just yesterday
you were a little girl.

589
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:39,149
We. <i>We</i> were little girls.

590
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:41,084
Dancing around
the back yard together,

591
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:43,687
Playing with
each other's hair...

592
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,459
This is the most
beautiful you've looked
in your entire life.

593
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:51,228

594
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,263
Yes!

595
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,232
How could I not be?

596
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:58,068
I'm getting everything
that I ever wanted.

597
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:03,206
But you're giving up
your dream to be a dancer
to stay here with marco.

598
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,576
( laughs )
debbie.

599
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:11,181
Can I...
Can I tell you a secret?

600
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:14,184
I never wanted
to be a dancer.

601
00:34:14,186 --> 00:34:19,189
That was my mom's dream,
not mine.

602
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:24,194
What? Never?

603
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:28,632
I mean, maybe for
a little while,
when I was a kid.

604
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:32,369
I mean,
I worshipped my mother.

605
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:35,238
You remember, she was
this big glamorous star

606
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,340
And everyone loved her.

607
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:40,343
And I wanted to be
just like her...

608
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:43,313
For a while.

609
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:45,082
What happened?

610
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:48,285
I grew up.

611
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:54,524
I can't believe
you never said anything
to your mom.

612
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:57,094
Well...

613
00:34:57,096 --> 00:35:00,130
I didn't want
to disappoint her.

614
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:02,599
When my mom blew her knee out,

615
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,268
She wanted me
to be the big star that...

616
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,804
She couldn't be anymore.

617
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:10,774
And when I met marco,

618
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:16,313
I finally realized
I can't live my life for her,

619
00:35:16,315 --> 00:35:19,416
No matter how much I love her.

620
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,288
It was like...

621
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,524
The first time
marco and I met,

622
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:29,759
I could hear this little voice
telling me,

623
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:33,163
"this guy's the one."

624
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:34,631
Ya know? Like...

625
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,234
The future was talking to me,

626
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:41,171
Telling me I had already
spent a whole lifetime with him.

627
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:44,474
Does that sound crazy?

628
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,210
No.

629
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:50,881
It's the most romantic
thing I've ever heard.

630
00:35:50,883 --> 00:35:53,183
Woman:
Senorina mirabella?

631
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:00,790
Oh. You know, I forgot
to thank you for standing in
for noelle today, debbie.

632
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,359
I--

633
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:07,297
I have no idea where
she could possibly be.

634
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,201
Debbie, where are you going?

635
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:13,470
See you at
the rehearsal dinner!

636
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,297
( speaks italian )

637
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:49,639
Scott: Dude,
you gotta slow down.
I can't keep up.

638
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:57,681
But wait a sec.
She said <i>she</i> kissed <i>you?</i>

639
00:36:57,683 --> 00:36:59,449
Why are we freaking out
about this?

640
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:02,919
Because I didn't stop her--
and I should have.

641
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:07,224
I shouldn't have even
put myself in a situation
where that could have happened.

642
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:08,959
I broke my promise
to mirabella.

643
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:12,295
Dude, you only have to feel
guilty <i>after</i> the wedding,

644
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:14,231
That's the whole point
of getting married.

645
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,933
Sage advice from the guy
who defines a long-term
relationship

646
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:18,768
As a three-day weekend in aspen.

647
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,504
I promised her
I was done with other women.

648
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:24,307
I don't know,
maybe I'm just not
cut out for monogamy.

649
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:26,810
(laughing) fantastic!
I've got a number
of two swedish flight attendants

650
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:29,980
Who can meet us on your boat
in three hours!

651
00:37:29,982 --> 00:37:32,616
What? I'm not
judging you, man.

652
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:35,952
You weren't there.
She was like
some fairy creature.

653
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:37,687
She put a spell on me.

654
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:40,624
She had these
soulful brown eyes,
like a gypsy.

655
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:45,695
And she smelled like
the perfume my mother
used to wear.

656
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:48,365
It was weird. There was
something about her,

657
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:51,368
Like...Magical.

658
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,574
I have to cancel
the wedding.

659
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,046
Oh, god, what have I done?

660
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,951
I've got to fix this.

661
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,727
Name?
Ryan hutton.
Father of the bride.

662
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:20,330
Is harper hutton here?

663
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:21,998
She is not on the list.

664
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,035
About fifty,
eyes like a tiger shark.

665
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:30,006
The unmistakable aroma
of chanel number 5 and pure evil
gives her away.

666
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:31,608
Not on the list, sir.

667
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,077
Keep an eye out.
She'll never be able
to stay away.

668
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,479
I got your back.
Thanks.

669
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,928
( voices outside )

670
00:38:56,934 --> 00:39:00,070
...About my age,
about this tall?

671
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:02,005
Ryan.

672
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,986
Mirabella: <i>Debbie,</i>
<i>are you in there?</i>

673
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:20,056
Something's happened.
Debbie?

674
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:22,826
(falsetto) I'm here.
<i>Can you come out?</i>

675
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:24,127
I need to talk to you.

676
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:26,129
Not feeling well!

677
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:27,864
Why don't you
talk to noelle?

678
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,734
That's just it,
I can't.

679
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:33,670
<i>She and marco</i>
<i>kissed last night.</i>

680
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,539
Just a sec!

681
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:37,974
<i>Debbie, what's wrong?</i>

682
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:40,977
I thought--you know,
didn't we sort of bond?

683
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:44,714
<i>I haven't seen noelle</i>
<i>all day. She disappeared.</i>

684
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,383
<i>I know it was her.</i>

685
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:49,052
Debbie, are you okay?

686
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:50,820
Not so good!

687
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,090
I shouldn't go through
with it, right?

688
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:57,627
<i>He kissed another girl.</i>
<i>He broke his promise to me.</i>

689
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:59,062
What choice do I have?

690
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:01,431
Oh...Oh...

691
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:03,666
Debbie?

692
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,969
<i>I can't go through with it.</i>

693
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:07,470
Right?

694
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:10,173
Oh...Ohh...

695
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:19,182
Oh!

696
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,792
Uhh! Uhh!

697
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:32,896
Ohh!

698
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:42,038
<i>Hi, this is amanda.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

699
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,508
Amanda, where <i>are</i> you?
Call me back.

700
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:50,046
I need to know does this stuff
work more than once! Ohh!

701
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:54,684
Mirabella!
Dad!

702
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:56,453
I'm so glad you're here!

703
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:58,087
Oh, honey.

704
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,825
Is she here?
Dad--

705
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:05,695
I'm telling ya,
she won't be able to resist.

706
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:07,931
Honey, what's wrong?

707
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:11,134
Dad, I think
mom might have been right
about marco the whole time.

708
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:14,037
Your mother hasn't been right
about anything since 1987

709
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,840
When she said,
"let's name her mirabella."
noelle: Look who it is.

710
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:18,208
Hi, noelle.

711
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,746
What's wrong with her?
I don't know.

712
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:25,648
Pre-wedding jitters,
I guess.

713
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,083
Have you talked to her?

714
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:29,252
Harper: <i>Oh!</i>
<i>What's that?</i>

715
00:41:29,254 --> 00:41:32,088
Sounds like an elephant
passing a kidney stone.

716
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,157
Has to be debbie.
Who's debbie?

717
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,926
Mirabella's cousin,
debbie hayworth?

718
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,228
Never heard of her.

719
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:42,832
Ooh. Too many
tequila shooters.

720
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,668
Debbie, are you all right?
Mm-hmm.

721
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:49,038
Okay, well, then you need
to suck it up,

722
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,942
Because I have got a hangover
that could bring down a t-rex.

723
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:55,712
After the dance-off
is all a blur.

724
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:57,714
And where
is mirabella?

Harper?

00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:19,015
Harper.

Oh, my--

This is not

( door opens )

778
00:45:58,056 --> 00:46:00,757
What are you doing?

779
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:03,259
Why aren't you getting dressed
for the rehearsal dinner?

780
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:08,231
I'm leaving.
Marco and noelle
kissed last night, remember?

781
00:46:08,233 --> 00:46:12,135
Moonlight magic. Gag.

782
00:46:12,137 --> 00:46:15,371
My mom was right
about him, debbie.
He's never gonna change.

783
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:18,107
Have you...
Talked to him yet?

784
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,343
No. I know that I have to--
don't. Don't!

785
00:46:20,345 --> 00:46:24,280
This could all just be
normal jitters. Cold feet.

786
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,985
It's not just about
a kiss, debbie.

787
00:46:28,987 --> 00:46:30,520
Marco can't--

788
00:46:30,522 --> 00:46:33,523
He can't express
his feelings for me.

789
00:46:33,525 --> 00:46:38,094
Every single time
it comes up, he clams up.

790
00:46:38,096 --> 00:46:42,098
I just-- I think
that I made a big mistake.

791
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,202
I don't think that
he's ready for marriage.

792
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:50,173
That is not true.
It's not true. Marco <i>loves</i> you.

793
00:46:50,175 --> 00:46:54,043
Look, I know how you're feeling.
My ex cheated on me.

794
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:58,314
And I bet that
you dumped him.
Oh, I did. But....

795
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,883
I didn't dump him
because he cheated,

796
00:47:00,885 --> 00:47:04,987
I dumped him because he cheated
and lied to me about it.

797
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:08,024
I gave him a chance
to come clean,

798
00:47:08,026 --> 00:47:10,259
But by then it was too late.

799
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:14,897
That's terrible,
debbie. I'm sorry.

800
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:17,166
Listen, I speak
from experience.

801
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:20,102
If marco tells you the truth
about what happened,

802
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:23,172
You will know that
it was just a stupid mistake

803
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:25,208
And he is so sorry.

804
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:28,911
Can you handle that?

805
00:47:28,913 --> 00:47:30,847
I don't know.

806
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:33,883
We have this huge dance
in front of everyone

807
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:35,618
At midnight after
the rehearsal dinner.

808
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,855
It's a vitturi
family tradition.

809
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:42,558
Okay. Give him until
midnight, then.

810
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,894
Can you do that?

811
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:49,632
Okay, until midnight.

812
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:51,934
Good.

813
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:54,570
How'd you get so smart
about this stuff?

814
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:57,139
Because I have an old soul.

815
00:47:58,175 --> 00:47:59,976
It's gonna be okay,
pumpkin.

816
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:05,114
"pumpkin"?
My mom calls me that.

817
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:09,218
Does she?
That's so funny.
My mom calls me that too.

818
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,153
All right, well,
I gotta go.

819
00:48:11,155 --> 00:48:13,422
But debbie,
what if he doesn't--

820
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:16,092
Doesn't tell the truth?

821
00:48:16,094 --> 00:48:18,060
Mr. Hutton.

822
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,062
I'm so glad you're here.

823
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:21,397
Marco.

824
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:26,035
Oh, I'm sorry I missed
your bachelor party.

825
00:48:26,037 --> 00:48:28,237
I hope you
behaved yourself.

826
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,640
Well, actually,
I messed up.

827
00:48:30,642 --> 00:48:34,443
I got drunk, and I don't know
how it all happened,

828
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:41,584
But it ended up
with me kissing someone
who is not mirabella.

829
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:46,055
But it didn't mean anything,
and the other girl
kind of kissed me, really.

830
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:50,092
But I made this promise
to mirabella that I was
through with all that.

831
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:54,130
And now I don't
know what to do.

832
00:48:54,132 --> 00:48:56,299
Sit down.

833
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:02,505
I want you to
look me in the eye
and tell me the truth--

834
00:49:02,507 --> 00:49:06,542
Do you love my daughter?
Absolutely.
With all my heart, sir.

835
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:10,112
All right, then.
I can help you fix this,

836
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:12,214
But you have to do
exactly what I say.

837
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:14,350
I know I have to
tell her the truth.
<i>No.</i>

838
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:17,153
Don't tell her the truth.

839
00:49:17,155 --> 00:49:20,122
You'll only end up hurting her,
and I don't want that to happen.

840
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:23,359
Believe it or not,
I was once in your shoes--

841
00:49:23,361 --> 00:49:26,295
And <i>now</i> look at me.
You're divorced.

842
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:29,532
Exactly.
Because I told the truth!

843
00:49:29,534 --> 00:49:35,137
You know, your divorce
is why mirabella is
so worried about me.

844
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:38,007
It was really hard on her.
I know it was.

845
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:41,544
Telling mirabella the truth
won't change anything.

846
00:49:41,546 --> 00:49:44,013
I don't want to lie to her.

847
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:47,183
If you love her,
you    <i>ha</i>to lie.

848
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:50,619
You can't tell her the truth,
no matter what.

849
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:52,521
Clear?

850
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:56,025
All right.

851
00:49:56,027 --> 00:49:57,994
Hey, where ya goin'?

852
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,264
To talk to a ghost.

853
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,603
Oh! Where did that boy go?

854
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,306
Harper.

855
00:50:10,308 --> 00:50:13,476
It <i>is</i> you!
It is not!

856
00:50:13,478 --> 00:50:15,311
What the hell's
going on here?

857
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:18,147
How can--how can you
look like this?

858
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:20,649
I'm sure I don't know you,
so if you'll just excuse me--

859
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:24,020
Harper, your ass.
What?

860
00:50:24,022 --> 00:50:26,689
I recognized it
in the bathroom.

861
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:30,626
I know that ass.
I fell in love with that ass.

862
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:34,096
God help me, I spent
the better part of the eighties
worshipping that ass.

863
00:50:34,098 --> 00:50:35,264
Really?

864
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:37,633
It <i>is</i> you.

865
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:42,171
Hello, ryan.
It's been a while.

866
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,308
I need a drink.
I'll get it for you.
Come.

867
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,113
I also need a priest.

868
00:50:51,115 --> 00:50:54,183
Gotta be a priest
around here somewhere,
this is Italy.

869
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:56,218
Where are
all the priests?

870
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,487
Oh, my god. Will you stop
being so dramatic?

871
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:00,456
I have a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

872
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:03,559
There is <i>nothing</i>
<i>reasonable about this--</i>
<i>or you.</i>

873
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,361
Okay, just take
a deep breath--

874
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:08,130
Don't--
don't tell me what to do.

875
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,403
Where are you going?

876
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:17,706
To find a cop.
This can't be legal.

877
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:37,393
( coughing )

878
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:40,663
W-what happened?

879
00:51:40,665 --> 00:51:43,265
You're going to be
very angry.

880
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,701
Distinct possibility,
if you're involved
in any way.

881
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:47,803
My knee was the size
of a grapefruit, ryan,

882
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:50,339
And--and there was this tonic,
and it is <i>magical.</i>

883
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:52,274
And I took a sip
and I turned young.

884
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,110
Amanda found it
in the back of the theater--

885
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:55,711
Lord knows how long
that's been there--
but I had no choice.

886
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:58,147
So in a way,
it's kind of like fate.

887
00:51:58,149 --> 00:51:59,682
And I hated marco,
I hated him,

888
00:51:59,684 --> 00:52:04,253
But it turns out
he really loves her,
and she really loves him back,

889
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:09,358
And okay, I admit,
I originally came here
to stop the wedding--at first.

890
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,161
But    <i>the</i>you know,
as it turns out,

891
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:14,897
I, um, I kissed him...
Of course.

892
00:52:14,899 --> 00:52:17,900
And now it's all gone
terribly wrong somehow.

893
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:20,569
Well, then,
you haven't
lost your touch.

894
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,841
This isn't a joke, ryan.

895
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:29,478
Seriously, harper, how could
you do something like this
to our daughter?

896
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,448
I know, I know,
it's terrible.

897
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,817
Are you mad?
Hold on.

898
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:38,220
Did you drug me?
Of   <i>cours</i>i drugged you.

899
00:52:38,222 --> 00:52:41,524
You were gonna drop the dime
on me. Plus, I really need
your help with this.

900
00:52:41,526 --> 00:52:43,225
You...Drugged me!

901
00:52:43,227 --> 00:52:45,194
I was <i>thinking</i>
<i>about our daughter!</i>

902
00:52:45,196 --> 00:52:46,795
Oh, sure you were!

903
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:57,840
Wha--

904
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:02,478
Aaaah!

905
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:08,851
Right.

906
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,687
Ryan?

907
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,222
Ryan!
Hmm...

908
00:53:13,224 --> 00:53:15,558
Ryan. Ryan.
Huhh!

909
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,927
What did you
do to me this time?

910
00:53:17,929 --> 00:53:19,695
Whose voice is that?

911
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:22,798
Is that--(coughs)--
(shrill) hey, that's me!

912
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,934
(deeper)
hey, that's <i>me.</i>

913
00:53:24,936 --> 00:53:27,670
Why do I sound so weird,
harper?!

914
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:35,277
Oh, my god.
Harper, this...

915
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:36,579
Is a miracle.

916
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:38,781
I know, I know,
you're young,

917
00:53:38,783 --> 00:53:40,950
I've been there,
I've done that.
Listen to me.

918
00:53:40,952 --> 00:53:44,520
Yeah!
I have ruined our daughter's
one chance at love.

919
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:45,921
So I need you to
help me fix it.

920
00:53:45,923 --> 00:53:48,757
Yeah, well, you can check that
off your to-do list,

921
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:51,627
Because I already fixed it.
What do you mean?

922
00:53:51,629 --> 00:53:53,929
Marco spilled
the whole can of beans.

923
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:58,901
I told him no witness,
no crime. Just deny
till he dies.

924
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:00,236
It's all good.

925
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:02,304
No. Ryan! No--

926
00:54:02,306 --> 00:54:03,939
Ryan!!!

927
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:07,776
Mirabella overhead marco
talking about the kiss.

928
00:54:07,778 --> 00:54:10,279
He   <i>ha</i>to confess.
Uh-oh.

929
00:54:10,281 --> 00:54:12,781
Yeah. I told her that
if he tells her the truth,

930
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:14,817
That means he loves her
and she can trust him.

931
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:18,020
So if he doesn't tell her,
she'll just think he's
trying to cover it up

932
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:21,657
And that means
he'll cheat on her again.
We have to fix this.

933
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:26,962
Wow. To see your mind at work
is at once fascinating
and repugnant.

934
00:54:26,964 --> 00:54:30,666
Oh, my god.
You are completely useless.
I remember why I divorced you.

935
00:54:30,668 --> 00:54:32,268
It was not a divorce--

936
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:33,969
It was an exorcism!

937
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:37,039
You cheated on me!
One time!
Mid-life crisis.

938
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:38,707
And then you lied about it.

939
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:41,310
And when I told the truth,
you kicked me out!

940
00:54:41,312 --> 00:54:42,945
We do not
have time for this.

941
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:44,947
Where could marco be?
Think, ryan.

942
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:48,917
Think? I can't think
because I'm 30 years younger
than I was 20 minutes ago!

943
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:51,287
I can't believe
you got me into this!

944
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:53,989
Wait-- yes, I can.

945
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:59,061
Okay, look, I just read
this guy's diary on the plane,

946
00:54:59,063 --> 00:55:01,297
Oh my god,
I hope I'm not too late.

947
00:55:01,299 --> 00:55:04,767
Look, whatever happens,
do <i>not</i> take a third dose.

948
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:06,568
( disconnects )

949
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:13,876
Mirabella.

950
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:16,011
Wow. You look...

951
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:20,616
What's wrong?
Nothing.

952
00:55:20,618 --> 00:55:23,419
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.

953
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:26,055
So we're both good.
We're great.

954
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,660
Look...

955
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:34,430
I don't want any secrets
between us.

956
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:38,067
That's not the way
to start a marriage.

957
00:55:38,069 --> 00:55:39,601
I totally agree.

958
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:46,041
So...You would tell me the truth
about anything stupid

959
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:47,976
You might have done
in the past?

960
00:55:47,978 --> 00:55:52,681
Distant, recent, whatever?

961
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:57,519
Well, um, mirabella,

962
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:02,524
What I'm trying to say
is that, well, I...

963
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:04,960
Wait! He's gonna tell her.

964
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:06,895
Um...

965
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:11,800
Of <i>course</i> I would.

966
00:56:11,802 --> 00:56:15,104
If I had something,
you know, to confess.

967
00:56:15,106 --> 00:56:16,972
( grunts )

968
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:18,841
Damn.

969
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:24,813
Mirabella...

970
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:26,949
Young harper:
I've seriously messed this up.

971
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:28,984
And how.

972
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:31,019
Okay,
what's our plan?

973
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:33,689
Ha! "our" plan?

974
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:42,998
Would you stop, <i>please,</i>
look what I can do!
How long does th<i>ohh! Ow!</i> Last?

975
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,635
And help me? We only
have until midnight when
the rehearsal dinner ends.

976
00:56:46,637 --> 00:56:49,638
I can't help it.
This stuff <i>really</i> works.

977
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,774
Of course it works.
It's--(gasps )--

978
00:56:51,776 --> 00:56:54,843
Oh, my gosh, the tonic!
I left it at the bar!

979
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,098
Hmm.

980
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:27,810
No! No, no!
Where is it?
I don't see it.

981
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:30,979
( gasps )
what?

982
00:57:30,981 --> 00:57:33,615
Oh. What happened?

983
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,684
Oh, aunt birdie.

984
00:57:35,686 --> 00:57:38,654
She must have chugged
the whole bottle.

985
00:57:38,656 --> 00:57:42,124
What's that
gonna do to her?

986
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:44,593
I don't want to know.

987
00:57:44,595 --> 00:57:46,929
Aunt birdie?

988
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:49,064
( gasps )

989
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:50,833
Oh, my god.
What?

990
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:55,971
There goes great-aunt birdie.

991
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:59,007
Proud matriarch
of the hayworth line.

992
00:57:59,009 --> 00:58:01,777
Wow.
She's got some moves.
Runs in the family.

993
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:05,180
You have really
screwed this up.

994
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,755
( music, chatter )

995
00:58:13,757 --> 00:58:16,959
( whispering )

996
00:58:16,961 --> 00:58:20,596
Hey. I am debbie,
and you are...?
Angus.

997
00:58:20,598 --> 00:58:22,965
Angus?
Angus.

998
00:58:22,967 --> 00:58:27,102
Okay, we only have
until midnight to
get this fixed, <i>angus.</i>

999
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:31,106
Hey. I know it goes
completely against
your nature

1000
00:58:31,108 --> 00:58:34,576
And ever fiber of your being
is screaming at you
to do the opposite,

1001
00:58:34,578 --> 00:58:36,745
But you have to
tell the truth.

1002
00:58:36,747 --> 00:58:39,615
Let marco off the hook
for this kiss, harper.

1003
00:58:39,617 --> 00:58:41,984
Tell him <i>you</i> kissed <i>him.</i>

1004
00:58:41,986 --> 00:58:44,086
He's gotta understand
none of this was his fault.

1005
00:58:44,088 --> 00:58:46,655
It's the only way
to fix this mess.

1006
00:58:46,657 --> 00:58:48,156
You're right.

1007
00:58:48,158 --> 00:58:50,125
Ugh!

1008
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:52,961
God, I <i>hate</i> it
when that happens.

1009
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:59,601
Noelle: No, I'm serious.
You look <i>amazing.</i>

1010
00:58:59,603 --> 00:59:02,304
Oh, the bride-to-be is here.

1011
00:59:02,306 --> 00:59:04,139
Mirabella.

1012
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:07,209
Hey.
Mirabella: Hi.

1013
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:10,979
Thanks for ruining my life.
I thought we were
best friends.

1014
00:59:10,981 --> 00:59:14,116
Excuse me?
Back up a sec.
You can drop the act,

1015
00:59:14,118 --> 00:59:17,286
Because I know that
you and marco kissed last night.

1016
00:59:17,288 --> 00:59:19,555
What are you <i>talking</i> about?

1017
00:59:19,557 --> 00:59:21,723
I heard him and scott
talking about it
under the bridge.

1018
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:26,028
"soulful brown eyes,
full of life,
embracing the moment."

1019
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:29,831
Mirabella, I was
really drunk last night,
but I wasn't <i>that</i> drunk.

1020
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:31,934
"mirabella,
you're so lucky!

1021
00:59:31,936 --> 00:59:34,102
He's so hot and rich,
<i>and</i> hot and rich!"

1022
00:59:34,104 --> 00:59:35,571
Okay, fine!
I was plastered.

1023
00:59:35,573 --> 00:59:37,306
After I left you guys, I--

1024
00:59:37,308 --> 00:59:40,042
I hit up the bachelor party...

1025
00:59:40,044 --> 00:59:44,646
And I can't remember
much after that.
Convenient.

1026
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:48,283
We've been best friends
since seventh grade.
I would never hurt you.

1027
00:59:48,285 --> 00:59:55,057
Besides, I'm not
the only one around here
with brown eyes.

1028
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:58,026
The jig is up!
No, no, no! She can't
find out it was me!

1029
00:59:58,028 --> 01:00:00,095
What do we do?

1030
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,631
We have to
convince her

1031
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:06,602
That there's no way debbie
would have kissed marco.

1032
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:09,237
Okay, how do we do that?

1033
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:12,207
Hey! Hey, hey--
hey, wait.

1034
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:14,076
We lay it on thick.

1035
01:00:14,078 --> 01:00:16,211

01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:04,039
No, don't--
hello?
<i>Dad, where have you been?</i>

1097
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:05,240
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

1098
01:04:05,242 --> 01:04:07,342
Hey, honey. What's up?

1099
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:09,010
<i>Where are you?</i>

1100
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:12,047
Who    that guy?
And how did I miss him?
Uh....

1101
01:04:12,049 --> 01:04:14,049
<i>Upstairs. Uh, I'm...</i>

1102
01:04:14,051 --> 01:04:15,483
Jet lagged.

1103
01:04:15,485 --> 01:04:18,220
<i>You sound weird.</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1104
01:04:18,222 --> 01:04:20,121
I do feel
very strange right now.

1105
01:04:20,123 --> 01:04:21,489
<i>I'm not myself at all.</i>

1106
01:04:21,491 --> 01:04:24,860
I'm gonna
go find marco.

1107
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:28,063
Dad...
<i>What is it, honey?</i>

1108
01:04:28,065 --> 01:04:29,531
<i>I'm so confused.</i>

1109
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:31,366
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>I can go through</i>

1110
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:33,168
With this wedding.

1111
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:44,045
It's just that mom said
mthat he would never
mbe faithful to me.

1112
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:46,214
<i>And then debbie said</i>
<i>the way I could find</i>
<i>if he would be</i>

1113
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:48,250
<i>Is if he confessed to</i>
<i>kissing noelle last night,</i>

1114
01:04:48,252 --> 01:04:50,018
<i>Because that would mean</i>
<i>that he's sorry,</i>
<i>and he didn't.</i>

1115
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:53,054
And I think that it speaks
to a larger character flaw,

1116
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:57,659
And on top if it all,
he can't even tell me
how he feels about me.

1117
01:04:57,661 --> 01:04:59,327
Honey, listen.

1118
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:01,429
<i>People are human.</i>
<i>They make mistakes.</i>

1119
01:05:01,431 --> 01:05:04,299
I made a lot of mistakes
with your mom.

1120
01:05:04,301 --> 01:05:06,568
And she definitely
punished me for it.

1121
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:08,103
But I never stopped loving her

1122
01:05:08,105 --> 01:05:09,204
Through any of it.

1123
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:11,907
<i>Even asset seizure?</i>
<i>All the lawyers</i>

1124
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:14,109
In the world weren't able
to change the way
I feel about her.

1125
01:05:14,111 --> 01:05:17,545
So then why
did you cheat on her?

1126
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:25,553
( sighs )
because I was selfish...

1127
01:05:25,555 --> 01:05:30,225
And lonely and...Insecure.

1128
01:05:30,227 --> 01:05:34,062
Your mom was a real star,
honey.

1129
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:37,299
When she blew out her knee,
I wasn't sad. I was thrilled.

1130
01:05:37,301 --> 01:05:39,034
I thought, finally

1131
01:05:39,036 --> 01:05:41,303
I don't have to share her
with the rest of the world.

1132
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:43,705
But that didn't happen.
She went right back to work

1133
01:05:43,707 --> 01:05:47,008
And became
the star choreographer,
the one everyone

1134
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,110
Wanted to work with,
everyone adored.

1135
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:52,247
And there I was,
still nobody,

1136
01:05:52,249 --> 01:05:54,316
Holding her coat
at parties.

1137
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:57,185
Dad, I had no idea.

1138
01:05:57,187 --> 01:06:02,624
What I did to her was
the biggest mistake of my life.

1139
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:07,128
I think I must have always
hoped for a second chance.

1140
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,065
But I never thought
I'd get it.

1141
01:06:10,067 --> 01:06:12,534
I never felt I deserved it.

1142
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:19,174
After you cheated on mom,
she couldn't trust you anymore.

1143
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:21,109
<i>And now I know why.</i>

1144
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:25,113
And I can't trust marco.
<i>No--</i>

1145
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:27,082
He loves you, honey.

1146
01:06:27,084 --> 01:06:28,316
<i>Really?</i>

1147
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:30,552
Where's the proof?

1148
01:06:30,554 --> 01:06:32,454
<i>He can't even</i>
<i>talk to me anymore.</i>

1149
01:06:32,456 --> 01:06:36,691
I can't go through
with this wedding.
I'm going home.

1150
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:38,593
Mirabella--

1151
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:48,203
Damn.

1152
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:53,641
♪ ( dance music )

1153
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,683
Oh, no! Not now!

1154
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:21,736
Hello?

1155
01:07:21,738 --> 01:07:25,040
Mrs. Hutton?

1156
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:27,542
What are you doing here?

1157
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:30,378
I know I'm not
supposed to be here.

1158
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:33,214
If you came to stop the wedding,
you're too late.

1159
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:35,216
The wedding's not happening.

1160
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:37,419
I know. I spoke to debbie.
She told me everything.

1161
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:40,121
What? W-why?
We're very close.

1162
01:07:40,123 --> 01:07:42,257
You were right about me
all along.

1163
01:07:42,259 --> 01:07:46,528
I broke my promise to her,
and then I lied about it.
When mirabella finds out--

1164
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:49,197
Marco, shut up.

1165
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:51,132
I flew all the way here
to tell you.

1166
01:07:51,134 --> 01:07:55,336
I know debbie.
I've known her
all her life.

1167
01:07:55,338 --> 01:07:58,206
She's a rare
and beautiful creature--

1168
01:07:58,208 --> 01:08:00,809
Incomparable, actually,
one of a kind.

1169
01:08:00,811 --> 01:08:03,711
But she has a problem
letting go.

1170
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:06,748
She loves mirabella.

1171
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,650
They used to be
very close...

1172
01:08:08,652 --> 01:08:11,719
When they were younger.
Really?

1173
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:16,724
Debbie pushed herself on you.
She wanted to prove that
you weren't good enough.

1174
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:20,161
But why would she do that?
She doesn't even know me.

1175
01:08:20,163 --> 01:08:22,197
She...

1176
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:25,300
Had her heart broken
a long time ago.

1177
01:08:25,302 --> 01:08:28,136
She loved a man
more than she wanted to,

1178
01:08:28,138 --> 01:08:32,207
And it made her feel
out of control, and...

1179
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:34,442
And he cheated on her.

1180
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:39,214
I don't know, I guess
she just stopped believing
in love after that.

1181
01:08:39,216 --> 01:08:42,517
And when mirabella
met you...

1182
01:08:42,519 --> 01:08:45,753
The playboy prince?
It was like deja vu.

1183
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:48,556
Debbie expected
the worst from you,

1184
01:08:48,558 --> 01:08:53,228
And when the worst
didn't happen on its own,
she made it happen.

1185
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:58,199
She made a <i>terrible</i> mistake,
and she is so sorry, marco.

1186
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:03,605
I know I never
approved of you,

1187
01:09:03,607 --> 01:09:06,875
But I was wrong--
I should have
given you a chance.

1188
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:10,478
You're a good man.

1189
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,814
Don't give up
on mirabella.

1190
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:15,183
I think she might have
given up on <i>me.</i>

1191
01:09:15,185 --> 01:09:19,187
Go. Look for her.
Tell her how much
you love her.

1192
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:22,257
I don't think
she'll believe me.
Prove it to her.

1193
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:23,892
Find a way.

1194
01:09:23,894 --> 01:09:25,560
I'll try.

1195
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:55,757
Oh, ryan, look at you.

1196
01:09:55,759 --> 01:09:58,293
The tonic didn't
last very long, did it?

1197
01:09:58,295 --> 01:10:01,296
Probably from trying
to keep up with you
on the dance floor

1198
01:10:01,298 --> 01:10:02,730
Like back in the day.

1199
01:10:02,732 --> 01:10:04,732
I knew I still
had it in me.

1200
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:06,701
(groans)
now I have proof.

1201
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:09,204
Oh, my gosh. Proof!
Wha--

1202
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:11,539
What?

1203
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:14,442
What are we doing?

1204
01:10:14,444 --> 01:10:16,811
We're looking for a book.
A big book.

1205
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:19,280
What's in the book?
Marco's wedding vows.

1206
01:10:19,282 --> 01:10:20,448
We have to find it--

1207
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:23,918
( men speaking italian )

1208
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,955
What the hell
are you doing?
I'm trying to hide you.

1209
01:10:26,957 --> 01:10:30,225
Ryan, they're on marco's side.
They don't even know me.

1210
01:10:30,227 --> 01:10:32,994
Oh. I didn't think of that.
I'm sorry.

1211
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:36,898
Apology accepted.
Actually, you're still
a pretty good kisser.

1212
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,600
You're not bad yourself.

1213
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:45,840
It's locked!
Why is it locked?!

1214
01:10:45,842 --> 01:10:48,309
How important is it
to get into this greenhouse?

1215
01:10:48,311 --> 01:10:51,646
The future happiness
of our daughter may
depend on it.

1216
01:10:51,648 --> 01:10:53,848
All right.
Get out of the way.

1217
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:56,951
Ohh! Oh...

1218
01:10:56,953 --> 01:10:59,287
That was a bad idea.
Are you all right?

1219
01:10:59,289 --> 01:11:02,023
Ahhh. Yeah. Yeah.

1220
01:11:02,025 --> 01:11:04,325
Oh...

1221
01:11:04,327 --> 01:11:07,562
I'm so sorry, harper.
For what?

1222
01:11:07,564 --> 01:11:10,565
I don't know.
For all of it.

1223
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:12,934
Everything I didn't do,
everything I did.

1224
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:15,303
Well, it was
a long time ago.

1225
01:11:15,305 --> 01:11:17,505
Not so long.

1226
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:22,510
Ever since we split up
I feel like I've been living
someone else's life.

1227
01:11:22,512 --> 01:11:25,913
I love you, harper.
I miss you.

1228
01:11:25,915 --> 01:11:27,749
I want to come home.

1229
01:11:27,751 --> 01:11:31,452
I love you too,
you idiot.

1230
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:33,321
( laughs )

1231
01:11:33,323 --> 01:11:36,024
I always have.

1232
01:11:36,026 --> 01:11:39,027
Now let's finish this--
for mirabella.

1233
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:53,508
( sighs )
which ones are the vows?

1234
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:55,843
I think all of them.

1235
01:11:55,845 --> 01:11:58,946
Grab as many as you can.
And do what?

1236
01:11:58,948 --> 01:12:03,851
We have to find mirabella.
You have to show these to her

1237
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:07,922
So you can prove that
marco really loves her.

1238
01:12:07,924 --> 01:12:11,025
You think
that's gonna work?
It has to.

1239
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:14,028
Come on.
Right behind you.

1240
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,102
Where are you going?

1241
01:12:21,104 --> 01:12:23,538
Where does it
look like I'm going?

1242
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:24,939
Wait.
I-I have to tell you--

1243
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:27,375
What?!

1244
01:12:27,377 --> 01:12:31,012
Go ahead, marco,
tell me how you really
feel about me.

1245
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:35,383
You're--you look--um...

1246
01:12:35,385 --> 01:12:39,020
Well, um...Um--

1247
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:41,989
Wait. Give me a second.

1248
01:12:41,991 --> 01:12:46,027
I'm sorry. I don't know
what's wrong with me.

1249
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:49,664
Whenever
I'm around you lately,
I can't speak.

1250
01:12:49,666 --> 01:12:54,068
I know. All right?
About the kiss.

1251
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:57,038
So there's nothing
left to say.

1252
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,840
But there is.

1253
01:12:58,842 --> 01:13:00,975
I love you <i>so</i> much.

1254
01:13:00,977 --> 01:13:02,877
I know what
I did was wrong.

1255
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:05,113
I should have never
let it happen.

1256
01:13:05,115 --> 01:13:07,615
So then why <i>did</i> you?
I don't know.

1257
01:13:07,617 --> 01:13:11,619
But all I can think about
since it happened
is how much I hurt you.

1258
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:18,459
Oh-- this way.

1259
01:13:18,461 --> 01:13:19,961
Come on.

1260
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:26,968
Marco: <i>...So beautiful...</i>
<i>This is crazy.</i>

1261
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:29,070
<i>I can--I want to never...</i>
<i>Do you hear that?</i>

1262
01:13:29,072 --> 01:13:30,638
What?

1263
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,107
Just talk to me.

1264
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:38,813
Tell me right now
in your own words
why you want to marry me.

1265
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:44,585
It's them.

1266
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:52,994
Wait!

1267
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:06,007
What is this?

1268
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:09,544
Here, take some.

1269
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:25,159
"to mirabella
on our wedding day."

1270
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,763
Are these...
Your vows?

1271
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:35,136

1306
01:16:25,982 --> 01:16:28,149
Still?
<i>Always.</i>

1307
01:16:28,151 --> 01:16:30,985
Oh, harper,
thanks god!

1308
01:16:30,987 --> 01:16:33,588
Amanda!
I have been driving around
these back roads for hours.

1309
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:36,090
This place is
impossible to find.
What are you doing--

1310
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:38,092
Move away from that bottle.
Why? What--

1311
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:40,661
Harper, the third dose
is permanent.

1312
01:16:40,663 --> 01:16:43,097
Permanent?
Yes, as in "forever."

1313
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:46,033
And that's a bad thing
because...?
( sighs )

1314
01:16:46,035 --> 01:16:47,768
What?

1315
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:51,072
I mean, we're talking
about immortality here.

1316
01:16:51,074 --> 01:16:54,942
This is an unimaginable gift--
to be young forever?

1317
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:58,145
You can't just throw this away
without even considering it.

1318
01:16:58,147 --> 01:17:02,216
No, no, no.
It's not a gift,
it's a <i>curse.</i>

1319
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:07,755
There's only
one dose left here.

1320
01:17:07,757 --> 01:17:11,158
You were going to be
the biggest star broadway
had ever seen.

1321
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,928
The stage, the fans,
the spotlight...

1322
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:17,632
And it all would have
happened for you, except...

1323
01:17:17,634 --> 01:17:19,867
My knee.

1324
01:17:19,869 --> 01:17:23,337
You can have that
all back now.

1325
01:17:23,339 --> 01:17:27,341
You can be the new star
of your show.

1326
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,814
I could, couldn't I?

1327
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:38,052
And you really
want that for me?

1328
01:17:38,054 --> 01:17:41,255
I just want to
make you happy, harper.

1329
01:17:41,257 --> 01:17:44,859
That's all I've ever wanted
from the first day we met.

1330
01:17:44,861 --> 01:17:47,061
I've just never been
very good at it.

1331
01:17:47,063 --> 01:17:49,430
So...Yes.

1332
01:17:49,432 --> 01:17:53,067
If this is what
makes you happy,
this is what I want.

1333
01:17:53,069 --> 01:17:55,903
No, no, no, no.
Don't be crazy, harper.

1334
01:17:55,905 --> 01:18:01,142
You will lose everything.
Can you really say goodbye
to mirabella forever?

1335
01:18:01,144 --> 01:18:04,011
Never see your grandkids?

1336
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:08,149
Come on. You can't
give all that up.

1337
01:18:08,151 --> 01:18:10,384
It's your choice,
harper.

1338
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:26,701
You were the most handsome man
I'd ever seen.

1339
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:07,108
Noelle: Girl, I cannot believe
but you look so hot! Married.
Thank you.

1340
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:17,418
Mom.

1341
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,220
What are you doing here?

1342
01:19:19,222 --> 01:19:22,356
Hi, mrs. Hutton.

1343
01:19:22,358 --> 01:19:25,326
I'm gonna leave you two
to talk.

1344
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:32,266
I know. I'm banned.

1345
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:36,470
But I've had time
to think about it.

1346
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:40,775
I've just been so wrong
about everything.

1347
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:45,379
I was--
I was wrong about marco.

1348
01:19:45,381 --> 01:19:48,783
So wrong.
He's a wonderful guy.

1349
01:19:48,785 --> 01:19:53,187
And he loves you,
and love is what
really matters.

1350
01:19:57,425 --> 01:20:00,261
I mean, everything else
fades away, but love lasts.

1351
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:06,233
And I'm so proud of you
for knowing that...

1352
01:20:06,235 --> 01:20:08,169
And following your heart.

1353
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:15,209
You still mad at me?

1354
01:20:19,114 --> 01:20:20,981
Can I come to your wedding?

1355
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:26,287
I couldn't do it
without you.

1356
01:20:26,289 --> 01:20:27,521
Oh!

1357
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:32,426
Oh, I love you so much,
pumpkin.

1358
01:20:32,428 --> 01:20:35,496
I love you more
than you'll ever know.

1359
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:41,869
How did I ever get
such a smart girl?

1360
01:20:41,871 --> 01:20:45,172
(laughs) I don't know.
I guess I had a good teacher.

1361
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:50,110
Wait.
What about the show?

1362
01:20:50,112 --> 01:20:52,279
( laughs )

1363
01:20:52,281 --> 01:20:56,450
Today is about
celebrating your dreams,
not mine.

1364
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:03,123
Today my daughter
is getting married! Ha!

1365
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:09,129
Who are you
and what have you done
with my mother?

1366
01:21:09,131 --> 01:21:13,567
Oh...It's just
a brand-new me.

1367
01:21:13,569 --> 01:21:16,136
Oh. You have got to see
cousin debbie.

1368
01:21:16,138 --> 01:21:19,373
She reminds me
so much of you.
Really?

1369
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:22,610
Then she must be
quite a girl.

1370
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:25,446
Come on.

1371
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:38,893
