4
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,070
Break it up! Go home!

5
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,748
We don't want trouble.

6
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,834
Let us through! We won't go!

7
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,914
We want to come through!
Let us come through!

8
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,908
We're here to fight for our rights.

9
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,230
Break it up! Go home!

10
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,113
Withdraw in orderly fashion.

11
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,592
We're here to fight for our rights!

12
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,552
For our wives and children,

13
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,512
and our children's children.

14
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,719
We want to come through!
Let us come through!

15
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,674
We're here to fight for our rights.

16
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,638
Dammit!

17
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,593
They're splitting our eardrums!

18
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,350
Cops, pigs, scums, bums!

19
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,677
Stand back! Disperse!

20
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,276
Cops, pigs, scums, bums!

21
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,953
Don't come near!
And quit protesting!

22
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,036
Stand back! Disperse!
Don't call us names.

23
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,110
Cops, pigs, scums, bums!

24
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,236
Guilbaud,
I should have known.

25
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,118
These peasants stop at nothing.

26
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,913
To think I was kind enough
to let him lodge here!

27
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,476
A Communist! What gall!

28
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,075
Is that you, Guilbaud?

29
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,195
Hello Madam.

30
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,237
When will you learn
not to slam the door?

31
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,033
I'm sorry, Madame Langlois.

32
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,629
Wait, I must speak to you.

33
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,353
I have no time.

34
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,755
Don't worry, I'll be brief.

35
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,399
You were demonstrating.
Don't deny it!

36
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,874
Does it bother you?

37
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,913
It embarrasses me.
People will talk.

38
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,678
Let them talk.

39
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,273
Try to understand.

40
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,675
During his lifetime,
my husband the Colonel

41
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,114
would never have stood for it.

42
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,078
I don't want to house
an anarchist.

43
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,232
My ideas are no concern of yours.

44
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,596
I pay for my room, you know!

45
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,031
If you don't like my ideas
I can move out.

46
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,152
Thas not what I mean!

47
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,435
- May I come in?
- The place is yours.

48
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,029
I'm crying my eyes out.

49
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,715
Is that damn teargas.
The bastards!

50
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,989
Would you have a cigarette?

51
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,270
I don't have any left.

52
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,355
I don't dare go out in the street.

53
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,718
I'm scared of crowds,
even at Carnival time.

54
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,756
They're not mild.

55
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,669
When the Colonel was alive

56
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,598
I only smoked army issue.

57
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,877
Don't mind me.

58
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,393
The commotion upset me.

59
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,679
Riots, tension, hate.

60
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,199
I can't cope with it.

61
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,709
Try to understand.

62
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,636
We come from different worlds.

63
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,590
That doesn't mean
we can't be friends.

64
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,629
Friends?
Hard to believe.

65
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,074
You won't be my friend?

66
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,435
I don't give a damn!

67
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:21,190
I'm so Ionely since my son died.

68
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,796
Tomorrow ill be one year
since he killed himself.

69
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,470
Two years to the day
since my husband died.

70
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,792
Forgive me.

71
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,037
Could you lend me your shoe brush?

72
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,958
Yes, of course.

73
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,876
What happened to him?

74
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,149
My husband?

75
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,078
No, your son.

76
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,796
He killed himself like a fool
on his way to Paris.

77
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,230
He was driving 180km/h,

78
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,635
yet he was in no hurry.

79
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,509
He never worked a day in his life.

80
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,516
And the Colonel?

81
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,473
He died in Indochina.

82
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,189
I hadn't seen him for five years.

83
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,756
We had separated long before.

84
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,875
As for my daughter, the shrew,

85
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,355
I might as well be dead.

86
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,955
I haven't had a word

87
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,355
since she was married.

88
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,710
She, who used to say

89
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,393
she'd never find the right man.

90
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,669
Still, she married well.

91
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,150
As for me, I lost

92
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,068
my title along with my illusions

93
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,875
when I married the Colonel.

94
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,710
From Baroness de Neuville

95
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,753
I became Madame Langlois.

96
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,471
Well, we can't have everything.

97
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,076
Would you like some wine?

98
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,909
I have no time, thank you.
I've an appointment.

99
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,519
Are you going to march?

100
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,358
Is over for today.

101
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,152
I've a date with a girl.

102
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,874
I should remind you

103
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,230
that I want no visitors here.

104
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,159
Thas what hotel rooms are for.

105
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,749
Do as you like, but elsewhere.

106
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,917
Do I ask you

107
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,997
where you make love?

108
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,829
Or how often? Or who with?

109
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,517
You're bothering me.

110
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,431
Don't misunderstand.

111
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,830
Anyway, I should tell you

112
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,431
that with the strike,
I won't be able to pay you this month.

113
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,794
I won't leave until I find another place.

114
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,639
I'm not going to sleep
under a bridge.

115
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,510
Thanks for telling me.

116
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,280
Is nothing, really.
Good evening.

117
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,437
Guilbaud, before you go,

118
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,312
leave me a cigarette.

119
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,476
Take the pack.

120
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,955
- Guilbaud?
- No, is me.

121
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,309
- Edith?
- Yes, mother.

122
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,353
- How did you get in?
- I still have my key.

123
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,313
You must give it back to me.

124
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,636
Why? Did you lose yours?

125
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,354
- I need it.
- You must have a lover!

126
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,438
At least spare me

127
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,790
that kind of humor.

128
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,473
So you are back.

129
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,116
What have you done
since your marriage?

130
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,355
Not much.

131
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,233
I thought you'd forgotten me.

132
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,312
Why don't you take off your coat?

133
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,949
I'm not staying, Mother.

134
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,669
What are the streets like?

135
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,718
Is quiet. Cops everywhere.
Smells like pig.

136
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,639
I was stopped on the way.

137
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,149
I really wanted to see you.

138
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,948
I was just talking about you.

139
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,950
Who to?

140
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,315
My tenant.

141
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,034
I thought you saw no one.

142
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,118
Atenant. Thas funny.

143
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,556
Your father's pension

144
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,355
wasn't enough to pay

145
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,279
your brother's debts.

146
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,154
I had to rent your room last month.

147
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,837
You rented my old room?

148
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,196
Why not Philippe's?

149
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,878
Your brother's room? Never.

150
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,231
Is been locked since he died.

151
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,308
I haven't touched a thing.

152
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,639
I'll never have the courage

153
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,876
to open the door

154
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,550
and face all those memories.

155
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,348
Don't be so melodramatic!

156
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,316
You wouldn't understand.

157
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,150
Don't move around like that.

158
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,193
- I have ants in my legs.
- Are you wearing stockings?

159
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,630
Haven't for two years now.

160
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,436
- What does the tenant do?
- He's on strike.

161
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,437
I didn't mean that.

162
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,588
He works in the shipyard.

163
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,837
He's a fitter or a tool-maker.

164
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,193
Is he a metal-worker then?

165
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,277
Why do you ask?

166
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,230
Why this sudden interest

167
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,034
in the working class?

168
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,830
The other day, my fortune teller

169
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,272
predicted a great love affair

170
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,515
with a metal-worker.

171
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,075
Won't you stay for dinner?

172
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,238
Edmond is waiting.

173
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,034
You didn't bother to write.

174
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,038
You could have sent a postcard.

175
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,631
A postcard?
I never left the apartment.

176
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,718
Didn't you go on a honeymoon trip?

177
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,433
You mean Morocco?

178
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,598
We didn't go.

179
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,556
Did Edmond change his mind?

180
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,552
No, I did.

181
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,873
He's a disappointment.

182
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,394
In what way?

183
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,108
Want me to draw you a picture?

184
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,390
I hate that expression.

185
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,716
I've told you a hundred times.

186
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,319
Father used to say it.

187
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,317
Thas no excuse.

188
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,511
Better come out with it,

189
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,517
don't beat around the bush.

190
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,269
I can tell you. Is no secret.

191
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,198
His family knows.

192
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,719
Edmond is impotent.
Do you think is funny?

193
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,875
You don't know how to go about it.

194
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,393
Thas the best one yet.

195
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,149
I know what I'm talking about.
Is because you don't love him.

196
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,157
If you did, you'd know how to...

197
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,190
Thas enough!

198
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,472
Besides, you never loved anyone.

199
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,757
Is not that I don't love Edmond.

200
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,158
But he's stingy and jealous.

201
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,153
Right this moment,

202
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,351
I haven't got a penny on me.

203
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,039
You deserve it.

204
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,999
You married him for his money.

205
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,078
Atv salesman!
A real Prince Charming.

206
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,352
You don't know
what I've been through.

207
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,074
I must beg and implore.

208
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,953
At least Father was never there.

209
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,709
But Edmonïs after me all day long.

210
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,239
He follows me around,

211
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,431
wakes me up at night,

212
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,359
wants to know
if I'm thinking about him.

213
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,838
He questions me, tracks me down.
Is hell.

214
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,229
Here's your key.

215
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,318
Can you lend me some money.
I'm broke.

216
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,438
What is this?

217
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,278
Is a cap.

218
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,751
I can see that.

219
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,758
Whose is it?

220
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,191
Guilbauïs.
He must have forgotten it.

221
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,837
His name is Guilbaud?

222
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,839
Yes, François Guilbaud.

223
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,715
Did you wait long?

224
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,671
Just five minutes.

225
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,998
Did you see the cops?

226
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,436
The streets are full.

227
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,154
Protect me, François.

228
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,353
Hold me tight.

229
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,478
Violette, you're flushed.

230
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,751
Is because I ran.

231
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,919
Violets are like that.

232
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,877
They blush when they're happy.

233
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,480
They fade when they're not.

234
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,475
What did you do today?

235
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,989
I loafed and wandered around.

236
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,876
I don't know what to do all day.

237
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,914
You should rest up.

238
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,351
I can't sleep.

239
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,471
I'm up at six,

240
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,194
as if I had to punch the clock.

241
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,636
A customer at the shop

242
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,115
told me about the riot

243
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,756
in front of the police station.

244
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,869
The cops held us back.

245
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,436
We couldn't get through.

246
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,428
And they used their rotten tear gas.

247
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,554
We had to disperse,

248
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,072
next time we'll fight.

249
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,719
You'll win.

250
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,035
Are you sure?

251
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,913
Yes, because I love you.

252
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,998
I love you, François.

253
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,876
I want to live with you now.

254
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,514
I feel cold without you.

255
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,632
Les get married, François.

256
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,389
And the strike?

257
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,035
The city hall is not on strike.

258
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,230
But now I'm broke.

259
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,829
The strike won't last.

260
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,918
And I'm still working.

261
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,078
I can't even pay the Baroness.

262
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,392
Don't feel sorry for her.

263
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,716
We'll rent a studio.

264
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,277
You'll be able
to leave the old hag at last.

265
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,156
I want a room for us alone.

266
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,238
You understand, François.

267
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,355
Come, I'll take you to dinner.

268
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,035
I told Mother

269
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,118
I'd come home late.

270
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,475
I can't. Dambiel is waiting for me.

271
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,996
They're assigning strike pickets.

272
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,073
Go and picket, my love.

273
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,879
See you tomorrow.

274
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,796
See you tomorrow.

275
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,551
Meet me at the shop.
Don't forget.

276
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,194
I love you so, François!

277
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,518
Let dawn follow night,

278
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,678
and bring on a new day.

279
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,190
A day of light, at last,

280
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,357
a day of hope,
peace and happiness.

281
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,356
We'll resume negotiations.

282
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,791
The workers of Saint Nazaire
will be joining us.

283
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,237
- And how do we eat?
- A support group has been created.

284
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,955
If negotiations don't succeed,

285
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,879
we'll march to the police station.

286
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,510
And the cops?

287
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,877
Same tactic. No violence.

288
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,359
How are you?

289
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,108
I'm fine.

290
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,954
We picket until eleven.

291
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,796
Menager just drew the list.

292
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,957
We must hold on.

293
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,071
I know. I heard.

294
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,953
Don't look sad.

295
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,878
It seems to bother you.

296
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,350
Is not that.

297
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,120
I can take it.

298
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,989
I got no mouths to feed.

299
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,796
- What then?
- Nothing.

300
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,753
Is Violette.

301
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,475
She doesn't agree?

302
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,434
Yes, but she wants to get married.

303
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,076
This is hardly the right time.

304
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,470
No money, no job.

305
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,955
Soon, I won't have a place to stay.

306
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,912
Come home and bunk with the kid.

307
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,633
Anything wrong with Violette?

308
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:51,550
She's crazy about me,

309
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,320
while I just pretend.

310
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,316
I'm fond of her, you know.

311
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,670
I think she's nice.

312
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,759
But I don't want to live with her.

313
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,112
She dreams, she makes plans.

314
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,748
She's happy, but I can't dream.

315
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,876
I can't make plans.

316
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,150
Her love scares me.

317
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,319
I don't know how to tell her.

318
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,875
Be careful.

319
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,354
What do you mean?

320
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,949
You mustn't hurt her.

321
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,589
I know.

322
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,635
Still, I feel like leaving her.

323
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,312
You're early.

324
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,518
François couldn't stay with me.

325
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,678
- Had your dinner?
- Not yet.

326
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,917
Will you be long?

327
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,156
I'm almost done.

328
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,955
What is it? You look different.

329
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,032
I'm happy, thas all.

330
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,155
Mother, if I married François

331
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,555
and left home

332
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,593
to live with him,

333
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,271
would you hate me?

334
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,833
Of course not.

335
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,838
I'd be happy for you.

336
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,356
You know that.

337
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:13,273
If my leaving
would make you unhappy,

338
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,630
I wouldn't go.

339
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,115
You worry too much.

340
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,880
Think of yourself first,

341
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,032
of your own life.

342
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,994
I've lived mine.

343
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,197
One, two, three, four.

344
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,912
Is him again.

345
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,952
The metal-worker?

346
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,114
Thas him.

347
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,073
One, two, three, four.

348
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,679
How wonderful!

349
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,837
Don't say a word.

350
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,871
I don't like it.

351
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,910
Please, Madame Sforza!

352
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,918
Is the other one.

353
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,468
Edmond!

354
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,078
Is serious, isn't it?

355
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,319
You must be on your guard.

356
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,629
What must I do?

357
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,794
I just told you.

358
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,235
I see nothing more.

359
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,797
The cards are silent.

360
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,116
- Where were you?
- At Mother's.

361
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,719
Is almost nine.

362
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,949
And this afternoon?

363
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,199
I couldn't get
through the demonstration.

364
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,112
There was a riot,

365
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,356
but you don't care about strikes.

366
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,358
I care but I'm not a metal-worker.

367
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,109
After all, tv salesmen
never go on strike.

368
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,956
Why not?

369
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,799
I'd like to see you.
You're such a coward.

370
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,388
- What are you doing?
- Taking some money.

371
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,398
Say, you didn't sell much today!

372
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,113
Edith, give it back!

373
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,550
I forbid you to!

374
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,718
I need it for my book-keeping.

375
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,151
I couldn't buy a thing today.

376
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,074
You just said
you were at your mother's.

377
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,468
I couldn't even pay Madame Sforza.

378
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,433
Do you think she does it for fun?

379
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,719
You mustn't see
that old fortune teller again!

380
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,753
I don't work all week

381
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,111
so you can waste money
on fortune tellers.

382
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,156
Let me go, Edmond.

383
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,318
You're hurting me.

384
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,309
You burnt me
with your soldering iron.

385
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,555
Look at the blister!

386
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,994
Forgive me.

387
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,157
Bastard!

388
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,469
I didn't mean to.

389
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,517
Soldering fiend!

390
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,874
Keep your rotten money.

391
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,753
I know where to find some elsewhere.

392
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,111
Now let me go, you dirty bastard!

393
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,390
Please calm down, darling.

394
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,794
Rotten cop, SS!

395
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,470
I didn't mean to!
Please forgive me.

396
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,395
I swear! Listen to me!

397
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,432
You should be ashamed!
You're out walking around like this?

398
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,437
Is your fault,
I've nothing to wear.

399
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,198
Thas no reason!

400
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:01,354
So now you're a street-walker!
The strikers must have loved it!

401
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,519
Get out! Get dressed!

402
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,314
Come back when you're decent!

403
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,273
You won't have to tell me twice.

404
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,755
I warn you, I've had it.

405
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,679
You won't see me again
anytime soon!

406
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,110
Edith, come back,
I didn't mean it.

407
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,880
Take the money, is yours.

408
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,879
I didn't know what I was saying.

409
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,950
You disgust me.

410
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,351
Please come back.

411
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,312
You know I love you.

412
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,750
You'll do as you please.

413
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,672
I could never live without you.

414
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,555
Is too much to bear.
I'm so miserable!

415
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,155
I love you, Edith.

416
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,750
Edith, I'm just too dumb.

417
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,195
Shit, I left my cap at the cafe.

418
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,637
You didn't have it on then.

419
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,949
Thas right. Now I know.

420
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,196
I left it at home.

421
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,079
See you tomorrow.

422
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,109
Good evening.

423
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:16,111
Do I shock you?
Are you afraid I'll catch cold?

424
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,319
Is that all?

425
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,757
You saw what matters.

426
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,279
Make up your mind.

427
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,876
You come at the wrong time.

428
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,318
I'm on strike at the moment.

429
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,269
I'm not.

430
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,959
I'm broke.

431
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,359
I don't care about money.

432
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,875
Come along, my sweet, is late.

433
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,357
You should be in bed.

434
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,598
You're the most beautiful girl
I ever made love to.

435
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,598
I never made love with a guy

436
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,075
I liked as much as you.

437
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,398
You're not a real whore?

438
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,398
I only work half-time.

439
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,149
Give me my coat, I'm a little cold.

440
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,153
Whas this?

441
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,318
My husband beat me.

442
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,275
- And this?
- Is a burn.

443
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,516
The bastard!

444
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,071
Funny you should say that.

445
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,430
My very words.

446
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,919
He's stingy and jealous too.

447
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,349
I walk the streets
to get even with him.

448
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,829
We've been married one month,
can you believe it?

449
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,519
Not really.

450
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,720
Are you married?

451
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,232
No.

452
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,197
You mean you're free?

453
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,913
Exactly.

454
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,592
And with the strike,

455
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,553
I've got lots of time to myself.

456
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,878
What do you do?

457
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,513
I'm a fitter and a tool-maker.

458
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,836
Do you know what that is?

459
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,674
Sure! You're a metal-worker.

460
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,518
Are you surprised that I know?

461
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,030
Is nothing to laugh about.

462
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,712
My fortune teller predicted

463
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,429
a love affair with a metal-worker.

464
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,518
Do you believe the cards?

465
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,269
I should, now that I met you.

466
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,235
There are thousands of us in Nantes.

467
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,150
- How beautiful you are.
- How pretty you are.

468
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,590
I love the touch of your skin.

469
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,588
I love the look in your eyes.

470
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,319
Whas your name?

471
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,556
Is François.

472
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,755
I'd like to see you
but you can't come to my place.

473
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,430
I rent a room
in the house of a crazy Baroness.

474
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,475
She doesn't want me
to bring girls home.

475
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,074
By chance, is your name Guilbaud?

476
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,838
How did you know?

477
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,676
The crazy Baroness,
as you call her,

478
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,154
is my mother.

479
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,476
My name is Edith.

480
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,120
- Who's there?
- Is your son-in-law.

481
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,912
Are you mad?
Do you know what time it is?

482
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,473
Is she in her room?

483
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,159
Who do you mean?

484
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,759
- Your daughter.
- Why?

485
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,552
She's gone.

486
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,391
She stormed out.

487
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,437
She hasn't come home.
I'm worried.

488
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,591
I thought she'd be here.

489
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,713
Girls usually go home to mother
after an argument.

490
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,911
She's not the type.

491
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,839
My little Edith!

492
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,679
Where can she be?

493
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,314
- Is my fault.
- I'm sure of that.

494
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,794
Thas enough, please.

495
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,672
What exactly happened?

496
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,558
Less than nothing.

497
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,035
You know how she is.

498
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,993
We were just talking,
then she got mad.

499
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,590
From what I've heard,
she's not entirely to blame.

500
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,952
What are you insinuating?

501
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,788
Edith told me a few things.

502
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,197
She came crying home to mother!

503
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,069
She confided in me

504
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,430
because she's unhappy.

505
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,034
What did she say?

506
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,593
She admitted
that you were not always...

507
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,315
that you were not up to it
when it came down to it.

508
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,596
- What can I do about it?
- I don't know.

509
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,437
See a doctor.
There must be a cure.

510
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,518
Edith is sincere.
She'll return to you.

511
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,357
Sincere!

512
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,393
I caught her
with her hand in the cash-box.

513
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,957
Today she went walking
naked under her fur coat.

514
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,714
She dared to tell me
she had nothing to wear.

515
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,713
You asked for it, my dear.

516
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,510
Where can she be?

517
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,598
Whall become of me, without her?

518
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,110
You should have given her money.

519
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,595
Maybe she's killed herself.

520
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,512
You don't know her.

521
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,598
I'll call the police.

522
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,957
They have their hands full
with the strikers.

523
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,311
What have I done?

524
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,271
You're not going to moan all night.

525
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,756
Go home and take a shower.

526
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:35,030
I'm sure by now she's home
like a good little girl.

527
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,679
That tramp!

528
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,437
Take hold of yourself.

529
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,919
I've always hated vulgarity.

530
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,634
I won't have her insulted
to my face.

531
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,195
Not that she's perfect, but...

532
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,511
Do you think she has a lover?

533
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,151
I never said that.
You're dreaming!

534
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,358
Someone you know.

535
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,232
Someone she met before me.

536
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,271
Someone she ran into again.

537
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,596
And I was getting worried,

538
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,554
I was ready to forgive!

539
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,035
You know who he is.

540
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,835
Thas enough my friend.
You're completely mad.

541
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,636
You know everything.

542
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,593
You're protecting them!

543
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,550
I warn you, if I find them together

544
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,469
I'm capable of anything.

545
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,909
If you see her, tell her.

546
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,519
I love Edith and I'll kill her.

547
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,755
Stay away!

548
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,518
I'll kill her, do you hear?

549
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,508
My poor man, you'll end up in court.

550
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,751
Look, is already daylight.

551
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,599
I must go now.

552
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,394
Tell me more.

553
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,879
Mother died as well.

554
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,913
I came to work in Nantes.

555
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,997
I looked for a room in town.

556
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,474
I came to your mother's

557
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,590
by chance.

558
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:01,198
You're a real country boy.

559
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,357
My darling Guilbaud.

560
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,509
Even tired you're beautiful.

561
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,832
I feel so nice in your arms.

562
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,237
Let me tell you that I love you.

563
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,589
I'd like to stay but I can't.

564
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,909
Is daylight,

565
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,032
I must go.

566
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,078
When will I see you again?

567
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,317
Tonight if you wish.

568
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,677
Be here tonight at eight.

569
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:58,230
Give me the strength to wait.

570
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,791
I need you so.

571
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,193
You're up early.

572
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,629
Something wrong?

573
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,035
I'd like to see François.

574
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,715
He'll be here at ten.

575
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,071
Last night, we finished late.

576
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,752
What a pity.

577
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,837
I wanted to talk to him.

578
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,835
He must still be at the Baroness'.

579
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,517
I don't want to go there.

580
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:19,711
Why?

581
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,394
She scares me.

582
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,751
Don't be silly.
She's not going to eat you.

583
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,789
Is it urgent?

584
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,352
Not really.

585
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,348
It is, for me.

586
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,434
What should I tell him?

587
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,472
Nothing. Is not serious.

588
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,873
Is it a secret?

589
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,159
Not really,

590
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,715
your wife already knows.

591
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,230
I'm pregnant.

592
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,668
Shit.

593
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,631
Don't say that. I'm happy.

594
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,792
François will make up his mind

595
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,753
to marry me, I'm sure.

596
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,791
Before,
we had no real reason to marry.

597
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,516
Is different now, you know.

598
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,354
Don't you agree?

599
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,071
I wouldn't know.

600
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,790
I do. And thas why

601
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,390
I wanted to tell him myself.

602
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,431
You can wait if you wish.

603
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,599
I don't want to be late.

604
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,714
The floor manager is on my case.

605
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,195
I've felt faint a few times.

606
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,038
I know him.

607
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,834
He'll make trouble.

608
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,234
Don't tell François.

609
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,151
I'm counting on you.

610
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,472
I swear.

611
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,511
You'll be godfather.

612
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,597
Sure.

613
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,308
Listen to me!

614
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,433
Negotiations failed.

615
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,437
St. Nazaire will join us

616
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,200
when we march on Thursday.

617
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,278
Will it last long?

618
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,152
Six months more.

619
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,152
We must hold on tight.

620
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,430
Marching got us nowhere.

621
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,996
We mustn't give up.

622
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,319
Quiet! There's worse.

623
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,391
Management decided today

624
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,678
to lay off some workers.

625
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,718
Is a dirty trick.

626
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,799
Talks will resume tomorrow

627
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,716
and we won't accept the lay-offs.

628
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,993
The following are dismissed:

629
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,796
I've come to see Guilbaud.

630
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,599
He's not here.

631
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,633
Are you sure?

632
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,959
I'm telling you.

633
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,272
Thas too bad.

634
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,956
He could be in his room.

635
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:06,193
He's not, believe me.

636
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,273
He hasn't come home.

637
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,757
Not that it concerns me!

638
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,956
Do you know where he is?

639
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,755
I haven't the faintest idea.

640
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,070
Tell him I'll wait for him

641
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,999
until ten at the cafe.

642
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,109
Is that you, Guilbaud?

643
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,954
Don't look at me. I look awful.

644
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,599
I must say you look terrible.

645
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,631
You should see yourself.

646
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,115
I was awake all night.

647
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,999
So was I,
but not for the same reason.

648
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,032
My son-in-law woke me up at two.

649
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,196
His wife was gone.

650
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,594
He'll get her back.

651
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,190
He was naturally upset.

652
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,760
They had an argument,

653
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,509
but I couldn't get to
the bottom of it.

654
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,756
I wonder what she said

655
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,714
to drive him to such a state.

656
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,070
He's usually so sedate.

657
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,510
She's fed up.

658
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,670
What do you know?

659
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,234
Just talking.

660
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,632
If you knew her you'd understand.

661
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,718
She has a terrible temper.

662
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,435
She's always rebelled
against everything.

663
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,631
What did the other one say?

664
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,108
What other one?

665
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,509
Her husband.

666
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,511
He was a little nervous

667
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,358
but I calmed him down.

668
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,391
When he left

669
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,114
it was almost three.

670
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,795
She must be home by now.

671
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,237
Couples always fight at first.

672
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,396
I forgot: A friend came to see you,

673
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,349
the one who always seems
to be smiling.

674
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,075
Thas Dambiel.

675
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,748
He's waiting at the cafe.

676
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,557
You shoulïve told me sooner.

677
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,949
Are you going out?

678
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,072
For five minutes, to see a friend.

679
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,477
François, my love, you're here!

680
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,272
I love you so.

681
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,598
I found myself alone in that room

682
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,596
and I was afraid.

683
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,550
Why?

684
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,115
I don't know why.

685
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,958
Afraid of dreaming you up.

686
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,116
Afraid of losing you.

687
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,548
I couldn't wait till tonight.

688
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,479
I'm here, darling.

689
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,716
Whas the meaning of this?

690
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,640
Do you need an explanation?

691
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,836
Will you stop taking me for a fool?

692
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,395
And yet is very clear.

693
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,790
Tell her, my darling.

694
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,151
I don't want to know.

695
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,670
At least you could shut the door.

696
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,110
No need to stir up the neighbors.

697
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,150
Well?

698
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,510
I've nothing to say to you.

699
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,918
I'm of age.
I love François and he loves me.

700
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,189
You talk about love!

701
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,393
Your loving husband was waiting
all night with razor in hand.

702
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,631
He was beside himself.

703
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,075
Mad with jealousy.
He threatened me.

704
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,033
He's out to get you.

705
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,599
To get me? My foot!

706
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,439
That asshole!
Look what he did to me!

707
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,312
Don't be so vulgar!

708
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,189
He's a brute, a sadist.

709
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,674
You mustn't see him again.

710
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,839
Thas enough from you.
Go join your friend.

711
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,789
- I'll be back.
- Hurry, darling.

712
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,037
You better find another room.

713
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,390
You better shut up.

714
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:32,275
Pay no attention to her.
Hurry on back.

715
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,634
- Where are you going?
- To my room.

716
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,831
Is no longer yours.

717
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,598
I don't give a damn.

718
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,198
I'm moving back.

719
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,469
With Guilbaud?

720
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,672
I'm not going to put up
with the two of you.

721
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:59,839
Edmond will kill you both
and me as well to top it off!

722
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,673
You won't protect me!

723
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:05,555
I'm helpless,
hounded, persecuted!

724
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,320
You'd still throw us
out in the street.

725
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,795
- You admit he's your lover?
- I never hid it.

726
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,036
- Where did you meet him?
- In the street.

727
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,834
- How long have you known him?
- None of your business.

728
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,557
I'd rather give you Philippe's room

729
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,877
than have you in the same bed
in my house.

730
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,150
I'm throwing him out anyway.

731
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,399
Then we'll both go.

732
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,555
Can't you understand
that I love him?

733
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,309
Don't you know what love is?

734
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,394
You take me for an idiot?

735
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,437
What passion is?

736
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,914
Or obsession?

737
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,679
You're telling me!

738
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,475
Nothing matters anymore.

739
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,872
I'm in love for the first time.

740
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,629
Words seem so empty

741
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,839
to express such a strong feeling.

742
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,352
I love his skin, his smell.

743
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:11,998
His strength,
his tenderness, his laugh.

744
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,875
I miss him one step away.

745
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:20,039
He must touch me,
he must have me.

746
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,235
He must take me away.

747
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,956
Nothing you may say

748
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,789
will make any difference.

749
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,232
I won't leave Guilbaud.

750
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,517
Never.

751
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,676
I'm out of a job and on strike.

752
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,437
Is pretty funny.

753
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,111
You seem optimistic.

754
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,629
I'm not going to cry.

755
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,120
There's no justice.

756
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,757
Justice?

757
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,872
Do you believe in it?

758
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,035
I believe in solidarity.

759
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,629
I also believe in friendship.

760
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,956
Maybe I'm too idealistic.

761
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,917
And maybe I'm wrong.

762
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,718
Les drink to us.

763
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,628
To friendship.

764
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,432
To friendship.

765
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,315
You look tired.

766
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,632
I had no sleep.

767
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,795
Something wonderful happened.

768
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,678
I know, I saw Violette.

769
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,434
It has nothing to do with Violette.

770
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:55,477
I never thought it possible.

771
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,555
I can't understand it myself.

772
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,190
I thought I loved Violette

773
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,789
but it wasn't love.

774
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,834
My life begins with Edith.

775
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,998
Is like new strength.

776
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,993
Strength to sustain me,

777
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,469
to keep on living.

778
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,234
What is it?

779
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,313
You don't believe me?

780
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,037
I was thinking of Violette.

781
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,639
Whall become of her?

782
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,513
I'll tell her.

783
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:44,355
We weren't really serious.

784
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,358
She was looking for you
this morning.

785
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,759
What did she want?

786
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,759
I don't know.

787
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,352
I'll see her tonight.

788
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,198
I'll talk to her.

789
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,989
Good morning, Madame.

790
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,155
Is François in?

791
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,958
He's on strike.

792
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,873
Thas why I thought he'd be in.

793
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,395
Well, you thought wrong.

794
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,239
- Who is it?
- Is for Guilbaud, not for you.

795
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,352
And don't ask me where he might be!

796
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,316
Could you tell him
that Violette would like to see him?

797
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,952
Is urgent.

798
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,515
No, wait. He might worry.

799
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,069
As you wish, mademoiselle.

800
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:05,354
Just tell him Violette stopped by.

801
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,554
Your father loved this sonata,

802
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,355
yet he had no ear for music.

803
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,509
Who rang?

804
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,553
Agirl named Violette.

805
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,637
She asked for Guilbaud.

806
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,149
What did she want?

807
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:51,869
None of my business.

808
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:57,191
Your Guilbaud
seems quite a Don Juan.

809
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:03,108
Spare me your comments, please.

810
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,116
Can I borrow this suitcase?

811
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:08,716
Where are you going?

812
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,552
- I'm off to Edmonïs.
- Don't go!

813
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,513
- I need my belongings.
- Please don't go!

814
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,712
He's capable of anything.

815
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,520
He's a coward.

816
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:22,154
He'll get down on his knees.

817
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,749
He'll beg my forgiveness.

818
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,315
He'll beg me to stay.

819
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,829
Take it easy, I know him.

820
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,317
He was out of his mind.

821
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,317
He was there, in the hall.

822
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,875
I can see him now.

823
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,348
I'm in no danger.

824
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:41,996
The cards are on my side.

825
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,709
I fear the worst.

826
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,639
He might kill you.

827
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,912
I'm not taking chances.

828
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:53,390
Don't do it, Edith!

829
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,715
Leave the gun here.

830
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:58,959
Don't be ridiculous.
Everything must be settled.

831
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,991
For his sake and ours.

832
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,033
Please think it over.

833
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,514
I know what I'm doing.

834
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,472
Just like your father.

835
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,477
Thanks a lot.

836
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,989
What a pity. Violette is out.

837
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,753
She went to the store.

838
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,239
Please come in.

839
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,475
That might be her now.

840
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,240
I know her footsteps.

841
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:54,834
You're coming in?

842
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,474
I'd like to walk a little.

843
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,876
Will you stay for dinner?

844
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,798
I can't.

845
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,837
We have enough, you know.

846
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,031
Really, I can't.

847
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:16,315
Mother, I'm going for a walk
with François.

848
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,630
I looked for you all day.

849
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,512
Did they tell you?

850
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:38,190
Dambiel told me
you wanted to see me.

851
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,355
I called for you

852
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,630
at the old frump's.

853
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,592
Was it that urgent?

854
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,837
In a way, it was.

855
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,718
I had good news for you.

856
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,070
And I have bad news.

857
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,716
I was fired.

858
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:01,030
You scared me.

859
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,151
Is not really the end of the world.

860
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,635
You'll find another job.

861
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,597
Can't you guess?

862
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,633
I'm pregnant.

863
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,799
Are you sure?

864
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,991
Positive.

865
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:32,034
I'm so happy.

866
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,673
Do you realize?

867
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,391
Your child.

868
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,558
A little Guilbaud.

869
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,391
Whas wrong?

870
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,556
Say something.

871
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:50,673
Please answer me, François.

872
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:54,870
My little Violette, is not right.

873
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,997
I don't understand.

874
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:01,078
I had a speech prepared.

875
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,157
I didn't expect this.

876
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:07,558
Is not your fault.

877
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:13,037
Is not true! Look at me.

878
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,993
Is not true, is it?

879
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,912
My little Violette,

880
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:23,715
I don't want to hurt you.

881
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:27,352
I love another girl.

882
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,799
I don't want you to cry.

883
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,192
Is hard.

884
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,516
Shut up, François. Go away!

885
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,951
Is not my fault.

886
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:40,955
Listen to me.

887
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:45,517
Leave me alone, please.

888
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,914
It hurts too much.

889
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:55,591
I don't want to see you ever again.

890
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,116
Watch out, my man.

891
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,477
You'll get wet.

892
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,908
Don't bother to lock, Edmond.

893
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,838
I won't stay.

894
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,712
You're wrong, my sweet.
You won't leave.

895
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,593
I came to get my things.

896
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,870
I've forgiven you.

897
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:15,799
The slate is clean.

898
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,673
No questions asked.

899
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,235
I'm not jealous any more.

900
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,635
You won't understand.

901
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,400
Is over, I don't love you.

902
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,431
I want a divorce.

903
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:32,476
We'll start a new life together.

904
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:35,274
This time we'll be happy.

905
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:40,431
You must listen to me.

906
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,798
I am listening. I'm not joking.

907
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,789
I'm not cheating and I'll prove it.

908
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,513
What are you doing?

909
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,359
The bird won't leave the cage.

910
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,359
You're mad.

911
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,676
- You'll never leave me.
- You don't know me!

912
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,393
If you left me,

913
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,238
you'd be unhappy.

914
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,396
You'd regret it.

915
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,438
Keep talking.
My minïs made up.

916
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,478
Don't do it!

917
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,517
Put that razor away!

918
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,870
You're scared.
You know I'm serious.

919
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:27,516
You're afraid to shoot.
Your hand shakes.

920
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,352
I'm not shaking.

921
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:31,039
Watch out, Edmond.

922
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,555
My love, my pretty whore.

923
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,194
I love you the way you are.

924
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,876
Stop this nonsense.
If you don't, I'll shoot.

925
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,355
My very own whore.

926
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,353
Shut up, I say!

927
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,315
You're mine, Edith.

928
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,039
Please stop!

929
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:50,309
You're mine

930
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,911
and you'll never forget me.

931
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,112
Oh, this stool!

932
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,390
Is so ugly.

933
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,832
Don't you think?

934
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:28,034
I should sell it.

935
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,470
I should get rid of all this.

936
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,193
Don't you agree?

937
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:36,432
- You've been drinking.
- Not really.

938
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,078
Is Edith here?

939
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:43,232
She's not back.

940
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,355
I tried to stop her

941
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,235
from making a terrible mistake.

942
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,516
What mistake?

943
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:56,958
My daughter a criminal!
Thas all I need!

944
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,189
Where is she?

945
01:09:58,440 --> 01:09:59,793
She's at Edmonïs.

946
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,275
Right into the lion's mouth.

947
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,160
- I'll go.
- I forbid you!

948
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,437
You're not yet
a member of the family.

949
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,518
And she won't be long now.

950
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,918
Thank you.

951
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:20,870
Have a drink with me.

952
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:25,274
Ill cheer you up.

953
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,552
You've had enough.

954
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:30,672
You won't? Never mind.

955
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:33,753
You're smashed.

956
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:37,118
I find your language amusing.

957
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,914
Where did you get the idea?

958
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:44,318
Well, here's to your health,
my dear.

959
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,389
Is shocking when the bourgeoisie

960
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,068
lets its hair down.

961
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:59,039
The bourgeoisie can go to hell.

962
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,276
I'm not one of them.

963
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:03,789
I'll tell you something:

964
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,754
I like you better
than all the bourgeois.

965
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:14,390
Your are fighting for something,

966
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,879
for survival, just like myself.

967
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,868
The bourgeois are rotting away.

968
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:29,149
They wallow in their ways.

969
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:33,273
But I swear they won't have me.

970
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,395
Is horrible!

971
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,670
My child... What is it?

972
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,313
Please calm down.

973
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,988
Is blood! Are you hurt?

974
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,555
Say something!

975
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,797
Can't you see that I can't?

976
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,077
Give her your handkerchief.

977
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,316
She'll bleed to death.

978
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:07,874
I'm thirsty.

979
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,594
Get a glass of water.

980
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,753
Edmond slashed his throat.

981
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,757
How horrible!

982
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:37,512
He went mad when he saw me.

983
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,473
He called me names
and threatened me.

984
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:42,831
He circled around me

985
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,474
waving his razor.

986
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:48,956
Laughing, weeping.
I almost went crazy.

987
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,598
I took the gun out.

988
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:54,360
I wanted to scare him.

989
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:58,314
He stood before me and said:

990
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,750
"Edith, you're mine.

991
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,678
You'll never forget me."

992
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,557
Calm yourself, my darling.

993
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,720
I'll never forget his face, his cry.

994
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:24,914
Hold me in your arms, François.

995
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,628
I love you.

996
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:32,719
Please don't leave me.

997
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:37,077
I'm here, my love.

998
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,671
I love you.

999
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,389
Now I'm free.

1000
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,950
Someone rang. You must hide.

1001
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,872
You're covered in blood.

1002
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,718
Who could it be?

1003
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,114
I expect no one.

1004
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:01,030
Stay here.
You're in no condition to walk.

1005
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:06,708
Is you.

1006
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,311
Am I intruding?

1007
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,559
Not at all.

1008
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,751
Is dark in here.

1009
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,433
Can't see a word.

1010
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,631
Is the Baroness in?

1011
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,953
I don't know.

1012
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,355
She must be in her room.

1013
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,231
What is it?

1014
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,916
Is about tomorrow.

1015
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:31,434
We'll gather at the cathedral.

1016
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,950
We'll go together.

1017
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,196
I'll wait at the yard.

1018
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,757
The cops will be there.

1019
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:42,636
You O.K.?

1020
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,877
Sure.

1021
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,435
- Doesn't look it.
- Yes, I am.

1022
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,471
- Have you seen Violette?
- I saw her.

1023
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,838
She was sad.

1024
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,718
Until tomorrow.

1025
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:29,989
I found these in a closet.

1026
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,439
In this house,

1027
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:37,589
I relive my childhood.

1028
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:43,230
A past I thought forgotten.

1029
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:49,673
This doll was mine.

1030
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:56,038
I made the dress.

1031
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:02,438
Memories that make me
both happy

1032
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,676
and sad,

1033
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:10,512
move and disturb me.

1034
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:14,357
Like you, François.

1035
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:20,473
I love you so.

1036
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:26,675
My life begins with you.

1037
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,071
My happiness,

1038
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:36,030
I owe to you.

1039
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,717
You should be at work.

1040
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,718
I don't want to see anyone.

1041
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:45,594
I'm so disappointed.

1042
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,990
Then come help me.

1043
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:52,557
You shouldn't feel that way.

1044
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:57,431
Is no fun to be rejected,

1045
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:00,354
to feel abandoned.

1046
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:03,593
Nothing to be done.

1047
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:08,635
His decision may not be final.

1048
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:12,235
I don't care about that.

1049
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,749
I'll never see him again.

1050
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:16,030
And the child?

1051
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:17,759
I'll raise it.

1052
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,951
You'll help me.

1053
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:24,871
Together we'll find a way.

1054
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:29,919
Where are you going?

1055
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,633
To see that girl.

1056
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,556
- What for?
- I just want to.

1057
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:39,392
Come back, Violette.

1058
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:08,478
Let dawn follow night,

1059
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:15,357
and bring on a new day.

1060
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:21,320
A day of light, at last,

1061
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:28,278
of hope, peace and happiness.

1062
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,837
Break it up! Go home!

1063
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,754
We don't want any trouble.

1064
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,039
Let us through!
We won't leave!

1065
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,316
Disperse! Go back home!

1066
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:49,080
Withdraw in orderly fashion.

1067
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:52,835
Let us through.
We won't leave.

1068
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,794
Let us come through.

1069
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:00,669
We're here to fight for our rights.

1070
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:02,831
Disperse! Go back home now!

1071
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,554
Withdraw in orderly fashion.

1072
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,518
There they go again.

1073
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,593
There's more of them today.

1074
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:31,077
Last time they used tear gas.

1075
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,399
You couldn't breathe the air.

1076
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:39,116
As usual,
Guilbaud is in the front line.

1077
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:42,677
- I'm scared.
- You have nothing to worry about.

1078
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,715
I'm afraid for François.

1079
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:50,992
If something happened to him,

1080
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:55,079
I couldn't go on.

1081
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,999
If he were arrested,

1082
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:02,671
I couldn't stand it.

1083
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:06,350
If he died, I couldn't live on.

1084
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:08,671
You love him that much?

1085
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:12,708
He's indispensable to me.

1086
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:17,068
I must know he's near me.

1087
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:20,192
I need his warmth.

1088
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:25,633
I couldn't go to sleep
without his caresses,

1089
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:29,196
I couldn't wake up

1090
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:32,790
without his smile.

1091
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,434
I couldn't go on living.

1092
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,312
Guilbaud is demonstrating.

1093
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,829
I'm not here to see him.

1094
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:56,517
What do you want then?

1095
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,995
To see your daughter.

1096
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:02,952
She's not to be seen now.

1097
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,151
Are you Edith?

1098
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:08,595
Who are you?

1099
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:11,800
My name means nothing to you.

1100
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,956
I'm a friend of François.

1101
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:20,313
Has he ever told you about me?

1102
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,833
Why should he?

1103
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,832
I'm expecting his child.

1104
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,873
Please, mademoiselle!

1105
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,638
I have nothing to say to you!

1106
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:39,955
You can be such a bore!

1107
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,912
Let her speak.

1108
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:44,920
You took François from me.

1109
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,792
I'll keep the child.

1110
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:51,672
Now we're even, you see.

1111
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:53,919
None of my business.

1112
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:55,195
Why are you here?

1113
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,032
To see your face.

1114
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,271
And I don't care to see yours.

1115
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:02,233
I don't care
what happened between you two.

1116
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:04,192
He loves me and I love him.

1117
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,750
No arguments! No scenes!

1118
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,758
Enough fighting already.

1119
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:13,393
Will you shut up?

1120
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:14,959
Is starting again.

1121
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,390
They'll use tear gas.

1122
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:26,713
Cops, scums!

1123
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,393
Bums!

1124
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:31,959
Don't come near!

1125
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:34,720
End this demonstration!

1126
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:36,798
Don't call us names!

1127
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:58,878
What happened?

1128
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:01,879
We must call an ambulance, quick.

1129
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,468
Come.

1130
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,112
How did it happen?

1131
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,919
Two cops beat Menager.

1132
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:36,112
François took them on.

1133
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:39,399
He was clubbed himself.

1134
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:43,192
He's lost a lot of blood.

1135
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,758
He's coming to.

1136
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,750
We mustn't move him.

1137
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:56,872
Listen to me, Edith.

1138
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:02,591
I'm here, my François.

1139
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:06,719
I need you so.

1140
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:10,599
You know how much I love you.

1141
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:14,190
Don't leave me!

1142
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,951
I'm going to die.

1143
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:25,912
No, you won't die.

1144
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,789
A doctor's coming.

1145
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:37,158
He'll take care of you, you'll see.

1146
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:45,715
Edith! Where are you?

1147
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,229
I can't hear you any more.

1148
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:52,838
You'll live for me!

1149
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,839
Edith... my life...

1150
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:04,591
Oh, François, my love.

1151
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:29,548
I could never live without you.

1152
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,591
Don't do it, Edith!

1153
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:36,871
François, my love.
