Let's go, let's go.

473
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,537
Hey, Big Momma, you sure know
how to fry up a fish burger.

474
00:31:18,538 --> 00:31:23,338
If you can catch it,
Big Momma can cook it!

475
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:27,060
Ooh, shake a tail feather.

476
00:31:27,061 --> 00:31:28,442
Ha ha ha!

477
00:31:28,443 --> 00:31:31,623
Oh, boy, I gotta cook.

I guess I literally fell for you, huh?

515
00:33:41,284 --> 00:33:43,385
I'm Lela.

516
00:33:43,386 --> 00:33:45,486
I know.

517
00:33:46,171 --> 00:33:48,135
I mean...

518
00:33:48,136 --> 00:33:51,436
Yeah, you are. I mean...

519
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:54,378
I've dreamed about this since
I was, like, in fifth grade.

520
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:56,230
Who are you?

521
00:33:56,231 --> 00:33:59,845
Brady, Knight in shining board shorts.

522
00:33:59,846 --> 00:34:03,254
That's a really long last name.

523
00:34:03,255 --> 00:34:05,122
Nice of you to drop in.

524
00:34:05,123 --> 00:34:08,225
Um, sorry. I didn't see you.

525
00:34:08,226 --> 00:34:12,966
Now that you do, do
you like what you see?

526
00:34:13,448 --> 00:34:16,416
Sure. [Clears throat]

527
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:19,090
It's really nice to meet you.

528
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:22,004
Excuse me for just one second.

529
00:34:22,005 --> 00:34:26,642
Brady, can I have a moment? A
really quick, important moment.

530
00:34:26,643 --> 00:34:28,413
Excuse me, Lela.

531
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:29,394
Okay.

532
00:34:29,395 --> 00:34:32,767
It was really great falling into you.

533
00:34:32,768 --> 00:34:35,541
I hope we can do it again sometime.

534
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:40,266
The mannequin with six rows
of teeth just asked me out.

535
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:41,441
Mack, something's not right.

536
00:34:41,442 --> 00:34:43,348
We could write a list of
things that aren't right,

537
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:45,162
starting with the fact that there
are enough things to write a list.

538
00:34:45,163 --> 00:34:47,563
Look around.

539
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,733
Nothing's happening. It's almost...

540
00:34:49,734 --> 00:34:51,579
It's almost dull.

541
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,860
Okay. And?

542
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:57,517
Okay, so when Lela sings that song about
finding the perfect boy and being happy...

543
00:34:57,518 --> 00:34:58,744
See, that's exactly my point.

544
00:34:58,745 --> 00:35:01,250
- Why does she need a boy to be happy?
- Because it's 1962.

545
00:35:01,251 --> 00:35:02,971
The thing is, after she sings that song,

546
00:35:02,972 --> 00:35:06,250
it's Tanner who's supposed to
catch her as he's walking by.

547
00:35:06,251 --> 00:35:08,677
Okay, what happens right
after he catches her?

548
00:35:08,678 --> 00:35:14,578
They fall instantly in love, but are pulled
apart, and a full-on dance war breaks out.

549
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:23,700
It's almost like nobody
knows exactly what to do next.

550
00:35:26,912 --> 00:35:30,372
Lela and Tanner were supposed
to fall into each other's arms,

551
00:35:30,373 --> 00:35:33,477
find love, and then are
pulled apart by a turf war.

552
00:35:33,478 --> 00:35:34,730
That's how the movie's written?

553
00:35:34,731 --> 00:35:37,561
But instead, they fell into our
arms, and now, they're into us.

554
00:35:37,562 --> 00:35:39,856
- And there's no turf war.
- Right.

555
00:35:39,857 --> 00:35:42,819
So we changed the movie.

556
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,872
- We changed the movie.
- We changed the movie!

557
00:35:44,873 --> 00:35:46,872
- Yeah.
- Do you think it will affect anything?

558
00:35:46,873 --> 00:35:51,095
It affected who they fell for. Who
knows what else it could affect.

559
00:35:51,096 --> 00:35:52,522
Okay, okay...

560
00:35:52,523 --> 00:35:54,394
Brady, you said that
there's a storm at the end

561
00:35:54,395 --> 00:35:56,312
of the movie that we
can ride out of here on.

562
00:35:56,313 --> 00:36:00,213
Yeah, three days after they meet.

563
00:36:00,935 --> 00:36:02,004
[Clears throat]

564
00:36:02,005 --> 00:36:05,090
I'm gonna ask you something,
even though I know and,

565
00:36:05,091 --> 00:36:07,470
I know you know, I don't wanna know.

566
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:10,173
Is there anything that happens
in the next three days that could,

567
00:36:10,174 --> 00:36:13,534
somehow affect that storm?

568
00:36:17,624 --> 00:36:19,390
See. Didn't wanna know.

569
00:36:19,391 --> 00:36:22,226
If you're looking for this to make
sense, you're on the wrong beach.

570
00:36:22,227 --> 00:36:25,589
I'm looking to see if Les Camembert is
building his diabolical weather machine.

571
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,310
How often do you hear that sentence?

572
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:29,895
Remember, I told you about the
maniacal real estate developer?

573
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:30,976
Or that one.

574
00:36:30,977 --> 00:36:34,592
Les Camembert knows this beachfront
property will be gold someday.

575
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:38,808
So he tells Big Momma to sell it to him
so he can build an overpriced resort.

576
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:39,816
She says no.

577
00:36:39,817 --> 00:36:42,433
Of course she does,
or there'd be no movie.

578
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:45,433
- It gets better.
- I can't wait.

579
00:36:45,434 --> 00:36:48,974
Let's just stop right here.

580
00:36:51,306 --> 00:36:54,540
No way. It's the Camembert hideout.

581
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:57,481
Let's go. Come on.

582
00:37:06,104 --> 00:37:07,482
This is it.

583
00:37:07,483 --> 00:37:10,363
How do we get in?

584
00:37:16,887 --> 00:37:18,807
Boom.

585
00:37:21,153 --> 00:37:24,504
Les: You know, I've dreamed of a scheme
like this every since I was a mere lad,

586
00:37:24,505 --> 00:37:27,422
conning my school fellows
out of their lunch money.

587
00:37:27,423 --> 00:37:29,857
Lunch? How about takeout?

588
00:37:29,858 --> 00:37:31,120
That's him.

589
00:37:31,121 --> 00:37:34,365
He's all British and proper,
but he's from Pittsburgh.

590
00:37:34,366 --> 00:37:37,468
- Who's that with him?
- [Evil laughter]

591
00:37:37,469 --> 00:37:39,203
What are they building?

592
00:37:39,204 --> 00:37:42,625
Desperate to get Big Momma's, Les
Camembert hires a mad scientist,

593
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:46,143
Dr. Fusion, to carry
out his diabolical idea.

594
00:37:46,144 --> 00:37:48,964
Come on, come on.

595
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:52,249
What is that?

596
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:57,410
Les Camembert's diabolical
weather altering machine.

597
00:37:58,456 --> 00:38:00,879
Yes, yes, yes.

598
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,407
Manual...

599
00:38:02,408 --> 00:38:07,868
This thing's almost built.
Shouldn't you be off book?

600
00:38:08,278 --> 00:38:12,155
This machine will so drastically
change the weather patterns,

601
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:16,505
it will literally still the
oceans so there's no longer surf.

602
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:18,935
It'll create humidity so dense,

603
00:38:18,936 --> 00:38:23,347
it'll rust every piece off of
those shiny chrome machines.

604
00:38:23,348 --> 00:38:26,119
The surfers will leave to
find a new spot to surf,

605
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:30,298
the bikers won't come near this
area ever again, and I shall triumph.

606
00:38:30,299 --> 00:38:32,423
Triumph, I say!

607
00:38:32,424 --> 00:38:34,815
You will have the last laugh.

608
00:38:34,816 --> 00:38:37,343
Yes. I've always been rather
wary of the last laugh.

609
00:38:37,344 --> 00:38:39,178
What if it was only moderately funny?

610
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:41,666
- Ha ha ha.
- Ha ha ha.

611
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:44,141
- Ha ha ha.
- Ha ha ha.

612
00:38:44,142 --> 00:38:45,135
Ha ha.

613
00:38:45,136 --> 00:38:47,617
- Ha ha...
- Hah!

614
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:51,638
And this thing never won an Oscar.

615
00:38:51,783 --> 00:38:53,792
Mack. Wait, wait.

616
00:38:53,793 --> 00:38:56,964
In the movie, Lela and
Tanner discover Les' plan.

617
00:38:56,965 --> 00:38:59,115
They unite the surfers and bikers,

618
00:38:59,116 --> 00:39:01,958
and destroy the machine,
which ends in an explosion.

619
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:03,258
That's what creates the storm.

620
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:05,118
So if Lela and Tanner
don't get back together,

621
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,216
which would put the movie back on track
the way it's supposed to play out...

622
00:39:08,217 --> 00:39:10,446
The chain of events that
create that storm won't happen.

623
00:39:10,447 --> 00:39:15,199
And we'll be stuck
here and never get home.

624
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,249
Don't worry.

625

I can explain it to you, Brady,
but I can't understand it for you.

So the way to get her to like him,

is for me to deflect her

Hey, frat boy. How'd last night go?

940
00:55:10,701 --> 00:55:14,868
So cool being one of those
guys, even for a night, ya know?

Well, I couldn't get
Lela to talk about Tanner.

I don't think we're any
closer than we were before.

Not really, no.

What if we can't get them together?

We could be stuck here forever.

- Yes.

more time with each other

to do something else.

You know, sometimes...

I think that boys don't
tell us what they're thinking

out, he would blow a gasket.

before, I mean, until you, but that's...

you can and can't do in life.

in that direction now.

- Me what?

would I not know who I am?

Uh, Tanner! Hi.

1077

Um, so I gotta go talk to Brady, but
how about we meet in a few minutes?

I'm just like her, you
know. I even have her eyes.

Of course, I let her
keep the rest of her face.

1086

We've only got one mother.

1087

So, now that we've temporarily
caused these changes in the weather,

1088
01:03:30,926 --> 01:03:35,111
how do we make them permanent so we can get
rid of these bikers and surfers for good?

1089
01:03:35,112 --> 01:03:37,130
We need to magnify the power.
