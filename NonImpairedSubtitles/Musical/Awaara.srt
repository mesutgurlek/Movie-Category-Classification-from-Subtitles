1
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:09,738
Spice for the front page, isn't it?
- All you can think of are...

2
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,042
headlines for the front page.
- Oh, drop it!

3
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,879
Here comes Judge Raghunath

4
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:32,634
Such a gentleman! Why on earth
did that goon want to kill him?

5
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,500
Here comes your friend

6
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,775
ls the jury in place?

7
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,509
Yes, my Lord. Present

8
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,275
ls the accused present?
- Present, my Lord

9
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,209
Who is the counsel for the accused?

10
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,184
Who is the counsel for the accused?

11
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,157
Have you no lawyer
to defend your case?

12
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,831
ln that case, the government...

13
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,266
My Lord

14
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,841
l'm the counsel for the accused

15
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,993
l do not wish to defend myself

16
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:09,062
l promised to defend you, if
you're ever arraigned. Remember?

17
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,798
Does the accused give his consent?

18
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:18,876
Yes

19
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:30,684
Raj, you have been accused of
a murderous attack on Judge Raghunath

20
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:34,015
You may plead your case

21
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:49,365
l swear to speak the truth

22
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,842
Judge Raghunath, can you tell us
why the accused tried to kill you?

23
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:58,174
Did he have any enmity with you?

24
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:05,781
Yes. The grudge that a born felon
bears against the judge...

25
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:10,861
who sentences him and
grants no reprieve

26
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,562
Could there be no other reason
for such animosity?

27
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,595
None. How else could l
relate to him?

28
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,068
l have no further questions

29
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,338
Defense may proceed with
cross-questioning

30
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,584
Judge, you are senior to me

31
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,821
lf in the course of questioning,
l happen to affront you...

32
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:51,095
do forgive me. Someone's life is
at stake. And you have taught me...

33
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,296
to ignore all relationships for
the dispensation of justice

34
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:02,904
This is my first interrogation.
Please give me your blessings

35
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,723
What do you mean when you call
the accused a born felon?

36
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,126
He has been a tramp and a hoodlum...

37
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,390
ever since he was a child.
His record says it

38
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,996
This penchant for crime has surely
been transmitted congenitally

39
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,267
Judge, do you have any children?

40
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,474
No

41
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,440
But how is this question relevant
to this case?

42
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:39,952
Most relevant. Think again. Are you
certain that you have no children?

43
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:45,180
No. But l reiterate. This question...
- Can you recount the circumstance...

44
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:49,485
when you threw your wife
out of your house?

45
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:53,822
My Lord, am l to be forced to reply
to such meaningless questions?

46
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:58,836
Ms Rita, you may ask questions
relevant only to the case

47
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,836
We wish to know whether or not,
the accused attempted murder

48
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,736
lf yes, then why?

49
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,841
Enough! Stop it! l'm a murderer!
Hang me if you will!

50
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:12,582
Proceed with your questioning

51
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:16,847
The accused does not deny having
assaulted Judge Raghunath

52
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:21,750
But, as you said just now,
the question is why he did it

53
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,863
This interrogation is meant
to reveal the answer...

54
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:29,761
if you my Lord, and Judge Raghunath
repose your trust in me for a while

55
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,993
You may proceed

56
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:37,067
l repeat my question.
Can you recount the circumstance...

57
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,870
when you threw your wife
out of your house?

58
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,977
l beg your pardon, Judge Raghunath,
but this question is very important

59
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,948
And not only for the accused.
For you too

60
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:51,453
The cause of whatever is happening
today, lies rooted in your past

61
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,024
Remember...?

62
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,193
Can you tell us? Why, when
and under what circumstance...

63
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,767
did you throw your wife
out of your house?

64
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,846
24 years ago...

65
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,853
l was practising law in Lucknow

66
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:32,025
l was the black sheep of the family,
because l opposed social norm...

67
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:38,067
and l had married a widow.
My father was a big gun

68
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,467
and was away in Bombay most of the
time. He was unhappy with me

69
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,276
But under no circumstance,
was l willing to leave Leela

70
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,777
She was so good to me.
She was such a good woman

71
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:55,281
And l was in love with her

72
00:10:56,522 --> 00:11:02,950
But once, on our way from
Kanpur to Allahabad...

73
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,723
little did l realise that
like a boat in midstream...

74
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,298
my life too was to be caught
in cross currents

75
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,124
''Cross currents in the midstream''

76
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,890
'' Beware''

77
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,099
''ln the current you will sink or sail''

78
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,766
'' Beware''

79
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:07,652
''The open skies''

80
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,157
''Careful sailor''

81
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,595
''Your boat is headed into a storm''

82
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,938
''Restless flow the deep waters''

83
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,801
'' Beware''

84
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,999
''Twigs are carried away''

85
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:54,395
''Steel sinks''

86
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,802
''So what do you think?''

87
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,410
'' Beware''

88
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,789
Aren't you feeling sleepy?

89
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,488
What are you thinking about?
- Why do they sing '' Beware''?

90
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:32,227
They say, these parts are dangerous.
Jagga the bandit. He's from these parts

91
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,965
Bandits...?
- Yes, but don't worry

92
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,370
As of now, he must be fast asleep
in some prison

93
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,811
Go to bed. l'm feeling sleepy

94
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,811
ln case you're afraid,l can come over
- No

95
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,801
No! The lady is with them!

96
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,732
Leave me!

97
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,760
You heartless bandits!

98
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,196
Where's your chief?

99
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,599
What right have you to terrorise
women from good families?

100
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,236
Aren't you ashamed?
- Ashamed?

101
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,339
Shame is for good folks,
not for bandits and robbers

102
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:23,413
As for me, my grandfather was a bandit,
my father was a bandit! But l wasn't

103
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,611
And your husband went and made me one!
- My husband...?

104
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:33,221
Who are you?
- Jagga. And l was innocent

105
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:38,192
But without a shard of evidence,
your husband framed me...

106
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,661
just because my father, my grandfather
were bandits

107
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,629
He framed me for rape
and he sent me to jail

108
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:49,135
So l've decided to prove
your husband right

109
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,043
Coward!

110
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,644
See what's wrong with her

111
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,451
Has she come to her senses?

112
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:11,190
No, she's still in a swoon

113
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:17,458
Let her go, Chief. She's pregnant.
She's going to become a mother

114
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,968
Touch her, and you go to hell

115
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:27,175
Pregnant? With a baby?

116
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:35,983
Her husband said that children born
of good folks turn out good

117
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,687
And children born of bandits...

118
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,153
turn out to be bandits. Always

119
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:49,232
Now let's see what the lawyer's son
turns out to be

120
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,365
Send her back once she recovers

121
00:17:56,642 --> 00:18:03,104
Good are those born of good folks!
And of bandits are bandits born

122
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,319
You should make me a gift.
- What's the occasion?

123
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,516
Not any occasion.
The lady is back

124
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,130
What did you say? The lady?

125
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,198
Why is it dark in here?

126
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:33,344
Lights! Tonight we celebrate!

127
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:41,946
lt is you who lights up my life

128
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,763
Now that you're back,
even the lights seem so bright!

129
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,624
Give me the wick

130
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:09,576
But Leela, how did you escape?
l hope you weren't in danger?

131
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:15,016
Your love was with me.
How could anyone even look up at me?

132
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,186
You are tired. Change.
l'll bring you your dressing grown

133
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,065
These last four days

134
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:37,399
The last four days were
like a lifetime

135
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,536
l took the police and l looked
everywhere for you

136
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,603
All the while, l feared...

137
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:58,557
l feared you were in grave danger!

138
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:08,839
But how did you escape?
And who was this bandit?

139
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,841
Some Jagga. He said that you
had convicted him

140
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:23,277
So he escaped to get even with me!
lf he has done anything to you...

141
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:27,390
l'll see to it that he hangs!
- At heart, he's a devil

142
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,451
But God saved me at the last moment.
Thank God!

143
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,456
Tell me something

144
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,668
Ask

145
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:44,438
Does a bandit's son necessarily
become a bandit?

146
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,471
Yes, it's bound to happen

147
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,679
But why do you ask?

148
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,880
Just like that

149
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,465
Let's see what comes first.
Your becoming a magistrate, or...

150
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,340
Why? ls someone expected?

151
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,248
A new guest

152
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,875
Now l don't have any chances
of becoming a magistrate

153
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,284
Why? What happened?

154
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:35,921
Whatever... let's talk
of something else

155
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,331
How do you like this?

156
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:45,930
Nice

157
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:49,932
Listen...

158
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,733
Are you annoyed with me?

159
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:58,015
Annoyed? No

160
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,743
Why should l be annoyed with you?

161
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,355
Have my lunch sent over

162
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,431
What's the matter?
Where are the servants?

163
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,333
God knows! Maybe they're all dead!
l have to do all the chores

164
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,832
Let me help you.
- You'd rather tell her all this

165
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,476
She's sitting around like a queen!

166
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,113
Not to be cross with Leela.
l told her not to strain herself

167
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:36,944
You know the condition she is in.
And in a few days from now...

168
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:41,555
She's going to bear the fruit
of her sins!

169
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:45,594
What are you saying?!
- What everyone else is saying!

170
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:50,524
For four days, she lived with a bandit!
And Jagga at that!

171
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:52,863
Don't you remember what
he was convicted for?

172
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,437
Do you enjoy making someone unhappy?
The jaundiced eye sees all yellow

173
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,872
Do you think you're beyond scrutiny?
Don't you forget...

174
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:03,013
women have had to stand the test of
chastity. Because society asks for it

175
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:04,475
Bhabhi!
(Sister-in-law)

176
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,515
Forgive me Bhabhi,
your pot is broken

177
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,553
lt's only an earthen pot. But remember,
a woman's honour is far more fragile

178
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,286
Once disgraced, her honour
can never be redeemed

179
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,226
Just answer my question!

180
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,793
Did you not know that your wife
was seeing her lover on the sly?

181
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:55,797
The villagers used to say that.
But l didn't heed what they said

182
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,936
You haven't yet told the court
why your wife deserted you

183
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,162
You know it! Women are adulterous!

184
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,863
l know what that means!

185
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,888
Raghu, how can you lose
your cool in court?

186
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,487
l'm afraid your chances of
magistrateship may be clouded

187
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:29,100
Chances of a magistrateship?
That's out of question now

188
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:36,205
Can a lawyer whose wife is under
suspicion ever become a magistrate?

189
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:39,905
The whole town is agog!
- What are you saying?

190
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,714
Aren't you ashamed to talk like this
about your wife?

191
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,046
l'm just saying what
everyone is saying

192
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,913
Let them say what they want

193
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:59,528
You're right. That's what l decided.
Let them say what they want

194
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:07,433
But how do l get rid of the suspicion?
lt's like a leech sucking on...

195
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,405
some dark corner of my mind!
- What now...?

196
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:37,799
Where's everyone?

197
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,273
Send Bhabhi over to me

198
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,943
Oh, l'm so afraid!

199
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,406
Why isn't someone coming to me?

200
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:58,645
That's my husband. Please,
send him over to me

201
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:07,489
Look Raghu...

202
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,996
l'm telling you again! That baby
isn't going to be born in this house

203
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:16,206
lf she wants to have her bastard,
let her go elsewhere

204
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,876
l'm not going to let the honour
of my family be tainted

205
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,672
l'm going to throw this
wanton woman out!

206
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:25,542
No! l'm not going anywhere!
No one can take me away from here!

207
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:30,686
He knows that l'm innocent!
He trusts me, he trusts me!

208
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:39,760
You're here! Now l'm afraid of no one!

209
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,227
Have you heard? They want
to throw me out!

210
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:49,404
They say l'm a wanton woman!
They say, l've no right to be here!

211
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:54,638
But now you're here.
No one will dare anymore

212
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:00,984
Tell them l'm untainted!
Tell them you trust me

213
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:04,446
Tell them l'm mothering your child

214
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:28,575
Why are you so quiet?

215
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,579
Have you fallen for what they say?

216
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,083
You're the one who told me...
''l don't care for the baying dogs''

217
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:45,426
lf you desert me, who else
in this world can l turn to?

218
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:50,000
Tell me... tell me that you trust me!

219
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,461
''Do you think you're above scrutiny?
Don't you forget...''

220
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,834
''women have had to stand
the test of chastity''

221
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:23,329
Why are you quiet?
Speak... speak!

222
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:29,932
You can see the state l'm in.
l'm afraid... afraid!

223
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:35,736
l'm going to become a mother
... the mother of your child

224
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:43,012
Have mercy! This is your baby.
This baby is yours!

225
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,753
Get out!
Get out of here!

226
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:06,636
''The most chaste of women''

227
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:17,679
''Were banished''

228
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:23,391
''Why is not the earth rent asunder
in sorrow?''

229
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:32,563
''Why are not the skies torn apart?''

230
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:37,601
''So suffers the girl her father
raised lovingly''

231
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:45,273
''Her father raised her lovingly;
her husband loved her once''

232
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,277
''Now she goes from door to door''

233
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:08,237
''Oh such games The Lord above plays''

234
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:28,948
''Oh such games The Lord above plays''

235
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:36,456
''ln the oyster
He makes the pearl blossom''

236
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:42,866
''ln murky waters
He makes the lotus bloom''

237
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:51,345
''Strange are your ways, Lord''

238
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:03,651
Congratulations, Lawyer!
A son has born to you.

239
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:07,889
Son of a decent family!
Born in a filthy gutter!

240
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:23,505
Do you not know what your wife
and your son went through...

241
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,479
after you shut your doors on them?
- No

242
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,311
Nor did you try to find out

243
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,315
But l can tell you

244
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:36,022
To get out of your way,
your wife left Lucknow

245
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:41,725
And your innocent son grew up
in a Bombay slum

246
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,735
One day...

247
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,348
Police! Scram!

248
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:12,394
Hey Nathu...

249
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,961
Hello, Constable

250
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:17,926
What are you up there like a monkey?
Why don't you go to school?

251
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:22,163
At school, the master asks for fees

252
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:26,173
My father hasn't the money
to send me to school

253
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,242
Look at Leela's son, Raj.
He lives in this slum too

254
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:33,247
His mother is worse off. Yet she
sends her boy to such a big school

255
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:37,883
What did you say? He isn't a boy.
He's a sissy!

256
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:47,387
Ma, why do you put oil in my hair?
- Oil keeps the hair soft

257
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:49,930
But why do boys in the neighbourhood
call me sissy?

258
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:53,331
So what? How do they
compare with you?

259
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,270
You're a good boy
who goes to school

260
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,441
You'll grow up to become
an educated man

261
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,669
And those wayward boys
will go to jail

262
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:04,003
Ma, what's wayward?

263
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:08,215
The ones who just tramp around

264
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:11,120
Those who think that whatever
belongs to others, belongs to them

265
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:14,281
Those who gamble and drink
instead of going to school

266
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,450
And they have fun!

267
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:20,353
Ma, when l grow up,
l'll become wayward too

268
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:25,160
Nonsense! You'll become a lawyer

269
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,296
Then a magistrate

270
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:31,968
And then, a judge

271
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:42,844
You're sitting here?
Everyone's out there buying chocolates

272
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:45,283
l don't have money

273
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,651
Why, doesn't your mother
give you money?

274
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,327
Daddy gives me a whole Rupee
every day!

275
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,720
You're rich. And l'm poor.

276
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,158
Eat this

277
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:57,394
No, Ma says never ask
for anything to eat

278
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,832
lf she told you not to ask,
go ahead and snatch it

279
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:05,941
No!

280
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,772
You're coming to my place
this evening, aren't you?

281
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,677
Why, what's happening?
- My birthday party!

282
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,544
You must come! lt's going to be fun!

283
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,985
You know, Daddy has ordered
such a huge cake!

284
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:36,973
Let's go and eat ice cream

285
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:52,885
Raj, aren't you giving me a gift?

286
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:57,050
l didn't have money to buy anything.
l'll give you some other time

287
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,258
Must you only buy something
to make a gift?

288
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,124
You can give me a flower

289
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,193
Really?

290
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:13,140
Here you are

291
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,743
Someday, l'm going to make
lots of money

292
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:20,406
And l'll buy a gift for you.
Something better than all this

293
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,252
Do that

294
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,454
But can anything be better
than this flower?

295
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,253
Come on Raj, meet my father

296
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,265
Ritu, say hello to the Judge

297
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,000
Hello, Judge

298
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:46,565
Bless you

299
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:51,906
You've grown up in these four years
You must've forgotten me.

300
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,011
Happy birthday

301
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,289
l've just arrived from Lucknow.
l owe you a present

302
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:05,460
As of now, l can give you a flower

303
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,292
Here you are

304
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,196
Let me put it on your hair

305
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,205
Someone has already put a flower
over there

306
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,803
Raj has given me this flower

307
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,107
Daddy, this is Raj.
He's in my class

308
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,041
l see
- Hello

309
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,117
Hello

310
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:29,885
Hello

311
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,489
God bless you, son

312
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:37,121
Raj says that he will become a judge
when he grows up

313
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,562
Very good!

314
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:43,566
Your father must be a real gentleman

315
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,760
What does your father do?

316
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,165
l don't have my father.
l have only my mother

317
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:54,437
Has he passed away?
- No! Don't say that!

318
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:57,375
My mother says he is alive.
But...

319
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:04,511
He doesn't live with you
... and you haven't seen him either?

320
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,591
Your father is a strange man.
- Not a word about my father

321
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,162
Else... else...

322
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,935
How can you let your daughter
play with boys like him?

323
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,074
Go to play, Ritu

324
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:30,472
Why, what's wrong with the boy?
l like him

325
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,145
He doesn't even know his father's
name, and you like him?

326
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:38,888
l'd say he's just a wastrel
- Forget it.

327
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,557
Must you hang on to
those rotten old ideas?

328
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,689
What was the Bandit's name?

329
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:46,890
Yes, Jagga

330
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:50,691
l remember you saying the same
at his trial

331
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:54,904
That a bandit's son
always becomes a bandit

332
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,596
l still stand by that principle

333
00:37:56,741 --> 00:38:00,336
Principles, principles and principles!
lt's because of these blind dogmas...

334
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:04,241
that you lost someone
as precious as Leela

335
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:06,914
And because of your principles,
you never married again

336
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:09,709
The dry parched desert that
your life is, is your own doing

337
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,911
So much so that you would rather
destroy a friendship...

338
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,250
between two innocent children?
Why, what has the poor child done...

339
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,916
to bring you to harm?

340
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,523
Not this boy. But it was...

341
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:24,667
someone like him who destroyed my life
... and brought me to disgrace

342
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:28,563
Maybe today, he too says
what this boy just said...

343
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:32,402
''l'm only my mother's son
... l have no father''

344
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:38,615
ln every urchin l see him...

345
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,943
the one whom my wife bore,
the one who isn't mine

346
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,955
My wife's, yet not mine

347
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:52,492
Rita looks good in that photo,
doesn't she?

348
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:55,962
But Ma, why do you work so hard?
This is why you fall ill

349
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,293
l'm not going to let you work
anymore, you understand?

350
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:02,634
You mad boy! lf l don't work,
how are we going to eat?

351
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:05,034
l'm a man. l'm the one
who is going to work

352
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,766
From tomorrow,
no going to school!

353
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:11,073
You won't go to school?
Won't you?

354
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,973
How will you become a gentleman,
unless you educate yourself?

355
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:15,445
Wayward imp!

356
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:22,517
Without schooling, how can you become
a lawyer, a magistrate, a judge?

357
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:30,992
lf you say so, l'll go to school
... and l'll work too

358
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:35,001
But l won't become a judge.
At Rita's l met a judge

359
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,503
l didn't like him

360
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,440
''Are you out for a good time?''

361
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,667
''Hey Mister, Hey Babu,
Hey Mr White, Mr Black''

362
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,811
''Out on the streets
we're waiting for you''

363
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:17,038
''We, the merry boot-polish boys''

364
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,593
Good morning, teacher.
Sorry, l'm late

365
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,059
l work, you know. l work

366
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:34,661
What's all this?

367
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:39,296
Brush, wax... l give you a good polish

368
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,038
Your name has been struck
from the rolls

369
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,432
What?
- You can't study here anymore.

370
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:49,237
But l've brought the fees too! lf you
say so, l'll stop polishing boots

371
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,415
So l can't study here any longer,
can l?

372
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,592
No

373
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:10,689
For a minute, can l talk to Rita?
l have a gift for her

374
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:15,304
Rita's father has transferred her
out of this school. They have moved

375
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,122
Why did you kick my ball?

376
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,894
Forgive me, l stepped on it
by mistake

377
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:45,363
How dare a boot-polish-boy?
- Hit him!

378
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:52,767
You're just a boot-polish boy.
You dare take me on?

379
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:56,778
Hit him!

380
00:41:57,081 --> 00:42:00,141
His coat... strip him!

381
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,385
Hit him!

382
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,967
My Ma is ill.
Let me go to my Ma

383
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:21,398
You can hit me some other time.
My Ma is ill. Let me go to my Ma

384
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,733
Your Ma is ill?
- Yes

385
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,340
His Ma is ill!

386
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,177
Run! Uncle Jagga is here! Run!

387
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,415
Get up. Come with me

388
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,624
Where to?

389
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:24,290
Wherever l go. From now on,
you go wherever l go

390
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:27,236
That's what your father wanted

391
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,239
You know my father?
- Yes

392
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:32,740
l knew him

393
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:40,244
Whatever l am today,
is all thanks to him

394
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,910
l owe your Dad an old debt

395
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,613
Then you'll surely help me
find a job somewhere?

396
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:49,724
Job? What job?
- Whatever! l'll do anything!

397
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,585
My Ma is sick! We haven't anything
to eat! Give me any job!

398
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,265
l'll clean the dishes, sweep floors,
carry luggage... l'll do anything!

399
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,061
Just give me a job! Give me a job!

400
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,395
You fool! Only fools work

401
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:06,605
You're a smart boy.
And you talk of working?

402
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,574
Unless l work, how will l eat?
How will l feed my mother?

403
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,613
Steal

404
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:12,941
Steal?

405
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:24,284
Stealing... no!

406
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,963
Yes, yes, yes!
Steal! Steal! Steal!

407
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:41,110
Pick pockets, locks,
rob, kill

408
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:06,994
You took so long, son

409
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:11,735
You've been hungry all day.
Go on, eat food

410
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:16,980
Food? Have you cooked?
- Yes, why not?

411
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:19,149
lt's over there, under the plate

412
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:23,150
The bread is warm.
l even cooked potatoes

413
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,150
Take some. lt's on the shelf

414
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,366
Have you found it?

415
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,030
Yes Ma, l found it

416
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,576
The bread, and potatoes too

417
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,184
The potatoes are delicious

418
00:45:55,853 --> 00:46:01,382
Eat it then. Give me a bread too.
l'm very hungry

419
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,026
Very hungry

420
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:05,160
Bread...?

421
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:08,795
Yes, Ma. l'll get it right now

422
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:11,691
Right now

423
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:20,174
''Yes, yes, yes!
Steal! Steal! Steal!''

424
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:22,607
''Pick pockets, locks,
rob, kill''

425
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,426
You thief!

426
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,898
Stealing bread?
- Excuse me, my Ma is hungry

427
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:49,732
She hasn't had anything to eat
in three days

428
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:53,401
Son of a gun! Off you go to the cops!

429
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:00,850
What's your name?
l asked you what's your name

430
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:03,845
Father's name?

431
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:06,455
Ma has never told me
my father's name

432
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,688
Where does your mother live?
l asked you where your mother lives

433
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:13,329
l won't tell you. l won't

434
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,792
lf you don't, who pays for your bail?
You'll go to jail. You know that?

435
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,742
Where are you running?
- Don't send me to jail!

436
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:31,040
My Ma is hungry.
Don't send me to jail!

437
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:39,685
Afraid, son? Don't be.
This is just your first step

438
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:43,150
The road ahead is very long

439
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:37,212
Hey, are you mad?

440
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:40,040
Why are you laughing at your bread?

441
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:44,678
This bread...

442
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,352
you know this bread?
She makes you dance

443
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:51,356
What do you mean?
- She made me dance!

444
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:56,492
Outside the jail twelve years ago,
had l found her...

445
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,362
would l be here time and again,
for her sake?

446
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:03,300
You've had enough for free.
Come on, the jailer is calling you

447
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:06,605
Your time's up. Find yourself
some other hotel

448
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:07,742
Time up?
- Yes

449
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,209
l don't think l like the food here
anyway. From now on...

450
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:11,904
it's Hotel Taj Mahal for me

451
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:15,382
lf you want to eat at
the Taj Mahal Hotel, stop thieving

452
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:17,711
Stop picking pockets

453
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:21,249
And do some honest work
- Sure. l'm going on a pilgrimage.

454
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:46,814
''l'm a tramp''

455
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:53,421
''Whether l'm rising or falling,
l'm always a star''

456
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,451
''l have no family, no home''

457
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:27,816
''l have no one who loves me''

458
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:39,328
''l don't have a lover waiting for me
across some river''

459
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:44,673
''For me the city is empty city
The unknown path is all l love''

460
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,340
''l'm a tramp''

461
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:15,000
''l'm not rich''

462
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,706
''l'd rather stay a pauper''

463
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,503
'' But the songs l sing
are merry songs''

464
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:24,470
''My heart is full of wounds''

465
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:27,707
'' But my eyes are always
full of smiles''

466
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:33,386
''Oh this world''

467
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:42,053
''ln this world, maybe l'm doomed''

468
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:48,236
''l'm a tramp''

469
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:54,942
'' But whether l'm rising or l'm falling,
l'm always a star''

470
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,788
Raj! You had me scared

471
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:49,096
Come on, give me a hug

472
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:59,237
Hey, are you talking English?
- This time in jail...

473
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:01,672
l came across one of the politicos.
l thought l'd make the most of it

474
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:04,813
And got to talk some English.
l could use it

475
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:07,608
Tell me, what news of Ma?
You told her, didn't you?

476
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:12,413
Yes, a long time ago. She thinks
you're away on a long business trip...

477
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:18,492
with your boss. When you go home,
you must go home in style

478
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:22,429
l have it all fixed.
- First, tell me...

479
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:28,434
have you been sending money to Ma?
- Of course! On the 1st of every month!

480
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:31,505
Say, you'd need some money,
wouldn't you? Keep this

481
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,603
Looking for this thing?

482
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:39,610
l guessed it was for me.
So why not take it for myself?

483
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:41,841
Want a ten or a twenty? No...?

484
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:46,512
Bravo, my boy! You'll make
your guru proud someday

485
00:53:54,097 --> 00:54:00,127
And someday, l'll ask your father what
the gentleman's son grows up to be

486
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:18,485
Raj, l've been dying to see you!
This time, it has been a whole year!

487
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,421
Where has this boss of yours
been taking you to?

488
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:24,559
This time, l've been
to London and more

489
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:26,193
London?

490
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:34,101
On my way back, l even stopped
at Arthur Road

491
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:38,567
My boss is into import and export.
- What's that?

492
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:44,141
You don't know import-export?
You're so naive

493
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:47,913
Your son is about to become a big
businessman, and you don't know...

494
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:51,144
what import-export is?
Listen to this, Ma

495
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:58,585
lmport-export means moving the money
between here and there

496
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:02,522
But mostly, it comes in this way

497
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:06,729
How would l know?
You've even started talking English

498
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,935
Sit, l'll get tea for you

499
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:39,232
What are you looking at?

500
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:41,962
l'm a thief

501
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:44,730
A lying thief

502
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:47,969
l've sinned

503
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,148
Why did you turn that photo over?

504
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:07,655
Whenever l look at it,
she seems to be staring at me

505
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:10,229
She brings back childhood memories.
Why don't you admit that?

506
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:15,598
Where could she be now?
Why don't you try to locate her?

507
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:22,744
Childhood days, and childhood friends
... do they ever come back, Ma?

508
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:26,543
l'm going out
- But your tea?

509
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:28,647
Forget it. l've got to see a friend

510
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,319
My son he is! Silly boy!

511
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,863
''This is a colourful season''

512
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:22,335
''Men think it's exciting
to see me tonight on the sly''

513
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,401
''Exciting!''

514
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:02,307
''This youth is so exciting''

515
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:05,679
''Your girl is mad about you''

516
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:53,821
''Why do you refuse me?''

517
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,458
''Why do you look away from me?''

518
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:01,368
''Look here, the world is yours''

519
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:08,109
''Why are you afraid of love?''

520
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:41,941
How much did you make today?
- Ten thousand five hundred

521
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:54,521
Why only fifty-fifty?
You can have many times more

522
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:56,887
How?
- Tomorrow morning...

523
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:00,859
a bank is being inaugurated.
Say, how's the opportunity?

524
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:03,498
A sleight of hand, and there's
a hundred thousand or so going

525
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,827
All you need is a car.
- Car?

526
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:09,562
A good car.
- For me, that's a sleight of hand

527
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:12,639
Eleven tomorrow. l'll tell you where

528
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:17,838
Good! Someday, you'll surely
make me proud

529
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,664
lt's late

530
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:44,500
You have to make it by eleven

531
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:46,998
First class car!

532
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:49,370
Car? Where?

533
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:50,568
Out there

534
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:53,549
Who's driving it?
- No idea

535
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:55,913
A girl just got down
and walked into that shop

536
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:58,087
Keys?
- With her, maybe

537
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:02,224
That one?

538
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:26,909
Can't you see?

539
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,557
No keys here

540
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:42,126
Return the bag.
- What for?

541
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:45,325
lt will make things easier.
We'll make it work.

542
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:47,000
How will you return it?

543
01:01:51,274 --> 01:01:53,037
What happened?
- l've been robbed!

544
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:54,541
Who did it?
- l didn't notice

545
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:56,542
He was with you!

546
01:01:57,146 --> 01:02:00,206
l had it a moment ago
- You didn't notice who robbed you?

547
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:02,341
Had l noticed, l would've caught him!

548
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:05,019
You...

549
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:06,579
Yes you!
- Who me?

550
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,351
Look, there goes the thief!
Stop! Thief!

551
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,366
He jumped over the wall!

552
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:27,669
Wait here

553
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:32,045
Come on, help me

554
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:41,383
There you are! Hiding!

555
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:52,624
Aren't you ashamed? Give it to me.
Else, l'll beat you to pulp

556
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:56,534
l'm going to kill you! Give me!

557
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:15,915
You dare stare at me like that?

558
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:24,422
Hey... knife!

559
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:46,618
Are you running away? Coward!

560
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:48,782
Coward!

561
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:57,760
He ran away

562
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:01,962
Anyway, here's your purse

563
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:03,604
Keep it

564
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:06,599
You've been through so much
trouble for my sake

565
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:14,139
No trouble. l've taken more

566
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:20,086
l should apologise. You risked
your life to get my purse back

567
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,484
And l suspected you

568
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,491
Not your fault

569
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:27,285
lt's just my looks

570
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,790
Sometimes even the police
are mistaken

571
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:31,498
Bye

572
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:37,295
How was the show?
- No use

573
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:40,498
We'll find a car. Why worry?
Get over to the place

574
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:43,303
l'll join you after a change
of clothes

575
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:47,211
Hey Romeo! You tear your clothes
no sooner than you see a girl!

576
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:48,348
Get lost

577
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:50,117
Get going

578
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:19,541
Stop! Thief!

579
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:18,601
Where are you going?

580
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:21,508
lnside

581
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:26,274
lnside? What do you want?
- Strange question

582
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:29,316
Your boss is the one who called me.
And you ask me what l want?

583
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:31,281
The boss, or the lady? Who called you?

584
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:33,479
Yes, the lady

585
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:35,953
So you're the one
who fixes the piano?

586
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:38,860
Yes! The piano fixer!

587
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:42,220
ls the piano in there?
- Are pianos kept outside?

588
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:44,799
No! lnside. Come on in,
else l'll get into trouble

589
01:07:07,723 --> 01:07:10,157
Looks like a billionaire's palace!

590
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:29,802
The mantle!

591
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:34,678
What a lovely mantle!

592
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:36,917
What a grand mansion!

593
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:45,326
What kind of a joke is this?

594
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:46,960
Here's the piano

595
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,296
This piano is in bad shape.
Badly damaged

596
01:07:56,772 --> 01:08:01,038
Rotten! lt'll take me time to fix it.
Go on, get back to work

597
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:03,035
l'll fix it

598
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:27,262
Who's playing my piano?

599
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:33,973
You...?
- You...!

600
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:48,751
l'm mistaken, once again

601
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:51,417
l thought it must be a thief

602
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:53,759
That's what l am.
- What?

603
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:57,762
l mean, who else but a thief
would come in uninvited?

604
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,401
No, it's good of you
to have come

605
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:04,300
You did me a favour.
l should've called you over

606
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:08,937
But l didn't know your address.
How did you find out my address?

607
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,984
No, don't ask me that.
lt's a secret

608
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:19,985
Let's say, it's luck that has led me
to your doorstep

609
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:21,784
Please be seated

610
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:44,101
No, thanks

611
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:45,812
Matches

612
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:49,283
Madam, he's the piano-fixer...
- Piano fixer?

613
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:51,782
Your servant thinks l'm here
to fix the piano

614
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,215
But you said...

615
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:56,824
Never mind, take the call. Go on

616
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:02,289
Strange fellow. He took you
for a piano mechanic

617
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:07,027
Not his fault.
lt's just my looks

618
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:10,261
lnspector sahib, no thief
came in here

619
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:11,939
Please wait here

620
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:15,771
What brings the police here?

621
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,603
Excuse me, l'll be back

622
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:25,487
A car thief has sneaked into one
of the houses in this neighbourhood

623
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:30,022
Have you seen anyone?
- No, no one came in here

624
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:33,861
She's wrong about
no one coming in here

625
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:38,393
l happen to be a visitor.
Would you be looking for me?

626
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:42,398
No... how could this be?

627
01:10:45,174 --> 01:10:46,141
Come

628
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:51,544
Grand house

629
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:53,539
Yes. lt belongs to the Judge

630
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:56,216
Judge...?
- Yes, he's my guardian

631
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,082
Like the guard on the train
... signalling red and green?

632
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:04,892
No. After my father passed away,
l have been his ward

633
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:08,026
For the sake of my education,
he left Lucknow and he came to Bombay

634
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,288
l am much obliged to him

635
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:17,571
Do judges sport such grand houses?
He must be making a pile on the side

636
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,638
What a thing to say!
The judge is very principled

637
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:23,175
He never spares criminals

638
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:25,313
l hope God spares him!

639
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:31,784
Not to worry. lf you're ever arraigned
in his court, let me defend your case

640
01:11:32,988 --> 01:11:34,580
You... lawyer?
- Yes

641
01:11:39,862 --> 01:11:41,727
l took you for a schoolgirl

642
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:45,659
That was a nice one. A couple
of months, and l'll be an advocate

643
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:47,335
Would you like to see my degree?

644
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:54,471
A judge lives here. And a lawyer too.
Leaves only one to make a full court!

645
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:57,646
Yours truly. And here l am.
- And what are you up to?

646
01:11:57,846 --> 01:11:58,938
Thievery

647
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:02,615
Stealing, picking pockets, locks,
ladies' purses, like yours...

648
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:05,286
that's what l'm up to.
- You're joking again. Be seated

649
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:09,749
You don't think l'm a thief?
- No, l think you're a gentleman

650
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:16,760
This is the new world order!
The thieves, the hoodwinkers...

651
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:19,967
they all dress in first class suits
like l'm wearing, and we take them...

652
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:24,765
for gentlemen. But those who work hard
for an honest living and dress shabbily

653
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:29,637
... are labelled tramps and wastrels.
The capitalists, the blackmarketeers...

654
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:33,781
the profiteers, the usurers...
who are they? Thieves, like l am!

655
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:38,380
You sound like a stock broker
or a banker

656
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:41,983
You might say that give and take
of money is what l'm concerned with

657
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:44,421
As far as banks are concerned,
l visit banks regularly

658
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:46,326
Be seated

659
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:50,798
Tell me your name

660
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:13,353
Tell me, whose photo is this?
- Mine

661
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:23,763
You...?

662
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:26,260
Yes, when l was young

663
01:13:26,769 --> 01:13:28,634
lt's a birthday photo

664
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:30,770
Your name?

665
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:32,973
Rita. Why?

666
01:13:42,117 --> 01:13:45,848
Ms Rita, would you like to come
to my house?

667
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:49,253
l'd like to show you
something unique

668
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:54,795
My mother would be very pleased
to meet you. Come

669
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:14,814
You...?

670
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,477
After twelve years

671
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:25,883
You've changed!

672
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:29,096
You haven't changed at all

673
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:34,897
Where have you been, Raj?

674
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:38,103
Looking for you

675
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:42,570
And at last, l've found you
- And when l saw you...

676
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:44,805
l took you for a thief

677
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:50,075
Not your fault.
lt's in my looks

678
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:42,701
''Ever since my lover
has come home...''

679
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:45,303
''my heart leaps with joy''

680
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:09,924
''His heart said
something to mine''

681
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:13,857
''And the old days returned''

682
01:16:14,269 --> 01:16:17,796
''Our days have returned again''

683
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,204
''He brings so much of happiness...''

684
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:23,874
''my heart leaps with joy''

685
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:48,427
''My heart he could win
through my eyes''

686
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:52,165
''l could lay the stars
at his feet''

687
01:16:57,145 --> 01:17:02,481
''My hopes soar...
my heart leaps with joy''

688
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:06,054
''Ever since my beloved
has come home...''

689
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:08,549
''my heart leaps with joy''

690
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:27,000
''We are young
and we are in love''

691
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:31,070
''He is the one who
makes my world''

692
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:41,146
''My heart leads him to me...
my heart leaps with joy''

693
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:47,428
''Ever since my hero has returned,
my heart springs to life''
