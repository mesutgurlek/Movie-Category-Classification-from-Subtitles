MADAME GEORGES VALANDRAY
WlLL RECElVE GUESTS AT HER HOME

18
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,204
ON TUESDAY, OCTOBER 20.
TEA, PORT, BRlDGE.

19
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,857
Oh, when the lady of the house

20
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,225
Shows no nous

21
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,595
And when you come to call
she's out and about

22
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:41,463
Although she asked us
with such glee

23
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,230
Here for tea

24
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,602
Lord, how forgetful she can be!

25
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,904
So how on earth can one
save face in that case

26
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,174
And what to do for Heaven's
sakes with these cakes,

27
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,010
The wonders set
for today's spree

28
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,481
That we see

29
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,349
Pride of Battenberg and Dundee?

30
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,478
Gilberte's forgotten us today

31
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,113
l think Gilberte
could not care less

32
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,680
Or perhaps love's
gotten in the way

33
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,692
She has a man somewhere, l guess

34
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,421
ls it Faradel or Charly

35
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,326
She meets at a hotel?

36
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,058
No, Faradel is too ugly

37
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:14,760
That poor man, Faradel

38
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,192
Ah ha, l see

39
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,296
You're talking of me

40
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,000
l can't say l'm sad

41
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,974
lf your thoughts are bad

42
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,374
'Bout a man who's here

43
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,344
You call him your dear

44
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,846
lf a chap is here

45
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,974
You call him your dear

46
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,244
Some people say

47
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,252
lf a chap's away

48
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,947
He's fair game for sport

49
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,956
And he'll know not aught

50
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,651
lt may seem like spite

51
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,488
But they are quite right

52
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:41,858
lt may seem like spite

53
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,056
But they are quite right

54
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,428
Such maladresse

55
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,524
From today's hostess

56
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,364
ls ripe for attack

57
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,165
Getting our own back

58
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,762
What can she expect

59
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,602
After such neglect?

60
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:58,304
What can she expect
after such neglect?

61
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,902
When you criticize her

62
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,846
Make sure you take care

63
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,473
That despite your hauteur

64
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,279
You've a pleasant air

65
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,979
And that your slightest slur

66
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,715
Seems like praise foursquare

67
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:12,247
Play it grand, make a stand,
keep it underhand

68
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,884
When you criticize her

69
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,588
Make sure you take care

70
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,289
That despite your hauteur

71
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,025
You've a pleasant air

72
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,760
And that your slightest slur

73
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,427
Seems like praise foursquare

74
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,163
Pull in your claws and purr

75
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,501
Smile before you glare

76
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,132
-But now let us take tea
-Let's take tea

77
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,438
-Let us serve up the torte
-And the port

78
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,876
l'll keep the macaroons
as round as full moons

79
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,209
And the chocolate creams

80
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,579
That fill up my dreams

81
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,619
Guess what l have just seen

82
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:42,746
Oh, what can he have seen?

83
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,051
Such great bargains and buys

84
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,523
Where can one find such buys?

85
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,118
-And at all the counters
-But where are the counters?

86
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,652
-And on every shelf
-Tell us, where is that shelf?

87
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,165
Down at Selfbury and Co.

88
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,497
There a-shopping we'll go
for satin and pure silk

89
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,661
And fabrics of that ilk

90
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,035
For fine, bright bengaline
and for light mousseline

91
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,472
We ladies can't be blind
to bargains of that kind

92
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:04,067
Down at Selfbury and Co.

93
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,340
There a-shopping we'll go
for lace and organdie

94
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,711

00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,012
And bombazine with braid
And nice, warm astrakhan

96
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,415
And next summer's gingham

97
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,613
Down at Selfbury and Co.

98
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,815
There a-shopping we'll go
for the warmest cashmere

99
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:17,845
That we all hold so dear

100
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,050
Pongee and messaline

101
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,218
Tartan and velveteen

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,488
For mohair and nankeen

103
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:22,721
And for lustrous sateen

104
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,855
On offer just today

105
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:27,297
Dear Gilberte is away

106
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,301
-So you may as well go
-So we may as well go

107
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,461
Without letting her know

108
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,630
And we'll just sneak out

109
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,573
When the lady of the house
shows no nous

110
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,771
And when you come to call
she's out and about

111
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,642
Although she asked us
with such glee

112
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,113
Here for tea

113
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,013
Lord, how forgetful she can be!

114
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,608
Forgetful she can be!

115
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,951
So how on earth can one
save face in that case

116
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:52,151
And what to do for Heaven's
sakes with these cakes

117
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:55,251
The wonders set for
today's spree that we see

118
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,422
Pride of Battenberg and Dundee?

119
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,624
-They've all gone, as you see
-So we see!

120
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,294
-And so now you can flee
-Let us flee!

121
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:06,669
Let's be gone
Far from this salon

122
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,264
And so be gone!

123
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,512
There are no bargains
at Selfbury and Co.

124
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,139
l bargained on the bargains

125
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,412
to rid myself
of that little chorus line.

126
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,942
Now that we're alone together,
let's carry on.

127
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,484
Good afternoon, Mademoiselle.
How are you today?

128
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,790
What do you care, Faradel?

129
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,319
Everyone knows that you're not
interested in young girls!

130
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:35,232
Here you are,
teasing me already!

131
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,793
Are you here
without Madame Verberie?

132
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,670
Of course. Mother goes her way
and l go mine.

133
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,971
She knows that l'm perfectly
capable of defending myself.

134
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,239
And even attacking.

135
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,906
Dear Faradel, don't pester me,
you won't have the last word.

136
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,642
Nor should l want to.

137
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,980
The last word with you is,
''Marry me!''

138
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,110
Marry you?

139
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,346
Heavens, no!

140
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,083
We all know
Faradel's speciality:

141
00:05:57,123 --> 00:06:00,422
you take aim
at married women and miss.

142
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,552
l beg your pardon.

143
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,494
Oh, come on,
aren't you here hoping

144
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,794
to woo the beautiful
Gilberte Valandray?

145
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,199
She's in your sights.

146
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,361
Bang, bang!

147
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,631
Missed!

148
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,229
Know why you'll miss her?

149
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,365
Because you're out of date,
my poor Faradel.

150
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:16,773
Out of date?

151
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,369
Yes. You woo them by attending
to their every need,

152
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,506
by sending gifts and,
above all, by running errands.

153
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,312
Faradel, alias the taxi!

154
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,443
Well!

155
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,681
Well, that's all out of date.

156
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,657
lt's simply not done,
everyone knows that.

157
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,820
Such experience in one so young!

158
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,422
You think young women
are still like they were

159
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,261
in my grandmother's day and age.

160
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,102
Don't deny it!

161
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,767
l recall how in a pretty gown

162
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:53,575
A shy, young girl
could turn me upside-down

163
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:57,208
Flirting held me in its thrall

164
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,050
At a debs' ball!

165
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,987
l like a different style

166
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,922
lt may seem futile

167
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:08,984
But it makes me smile

168
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,962
l like to go skating

169
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,794
Drink in bars, go dancing

170
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:16,324
Who cares if it's shocking!

171
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:21,432
l love the dances
of my great aunt's day

172
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:25,035
Partners held hands
in a distant way

173
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,102
l like a different style

174
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,307
lt may seem futile

175
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:37,050
But it makes me smile

176
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,422
l have the feeling
Madame Valandray has forgotten

177
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,194
that she was supposed
to be at home for friends today.

178
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,827
There's no need to stand
on ceremony with friends.

179
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,200
Besides, Gilberte
is a whirlwind,

180
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,205
and a whirlwind doesn't run
to a fixed schedule.

181
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,434
Her sister,
Mademoiselle Poumaillac,

182
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,874
is more like a whirlwind!

183
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,570
Mademoiselle Poumaillac
is a tornado.

184
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:02,069
l've never known
such a turbulent spinster.

185
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,741
Perhaps that's
what makes her turbulent.

186
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,377
Ah! That's Mademoiselle
Poumaillac.

187
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,545
So l hear.

188
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,953
...and this for
the laundry room.

189
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,980
How are you, my dear?

190
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,925
lt's lovely to see you.

191
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,622
How's your mother?

192
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,823
l've left the large parcels
in the motor.

193
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,230
Send the man down for them.

194
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,597
Good old Faradel!

195
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,933
Ever loyal...ever precise...

196
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,461
-What have you brought us?
-l called to...

197
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,133
My dear,
those department stores...

198
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,701
l was only there for an hour
but l'm absolutely exhausted.

199
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,546
Guess whom l just met
on the Boulevard Haussmann.

200
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,210
Pélissot! The man's
the ghost of himself.

201
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,344
He looks a hundred.

202
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,150
His mistress has just left him.

203
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,919
l saw a darling little slip
on Rue de la Paix.

204
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,051
Did he catch her
in ''flagrante delicto''?

205
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,120
With ribbons along the hem
and a lovely cut.

206
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:54,655
She was a little minx.
Darling, absolutely darling.

207
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,224
But you haven't had tea...

208
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,827
We have, we have.

209
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,498
Honestly, why isn't Gilberte
here for her at home?

210
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,405
Her mind's never
on what she's doing.

211
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,500
Pour me a drop of port.

212
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,513
l take port at tea,
it's less debilitating.

213
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,881
-You have an iron constitution!
-No, l'm less and less active.

214
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,614
l feel absolutely wiped out.

215
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:25,259
All right, Faradel,
l'm listening now.

216
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,663
l called to bring tickets
for a box, tomorrow evening.

217
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:27,688
At which theatre?

218
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,995
The Cornmarket.

219
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,799
lsn't it in an old
joiner's workshop

220
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,566
out beyond the Bastille Square?

221
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,040
That's the place, the audience
sits on benches and,

222
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,804
in crepuscular light,

223
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,970
the actors, without sets
or costumes,

224
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,446
recite medieval mystery plays
in the original Old French.

225
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,176
lt's original, all right.

226
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,650
No one can understand a word.
lt's all the rage.

227
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:49,314
Most interesting.
l'm sure we shan't miss it,

228
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,915
but l believe my sister plans
to attend tomorrow's premiere

229
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,289
of Ratamu Pataga.

230
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,920
Ratamu Pataga. What is that?

231
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,930
You're the last to hear
about anything, Huguette.

232
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,455
lt's the opening night
for the Lapland ballet.

233
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,330
The leading dancer is a seal.

234
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,097
Everyone who's anyone
will be there tomorrow!

235
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,694
Madame Valandray has tickets?

236
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:06,932
l believe not.

237
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:10,101
May l hurry and get you a box,
if there are any left?

238
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:13,339
-Don't go to the trouble.
-l'd be delighted.

239
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,869
l'll be right back.

240
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,512
What a charming fellow,
always ready to oblige.

241
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,048
-Unusual for a taxi!
-A taxi?

242
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,789
l call him the taxi because
he's always running errands.

243
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,319
You little minx.

244
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,025
l always speak my mind.

245
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,363
How unwise of you.
lf you're that demanding,

246
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,028
you'll never find a husband.

247
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,229
l already have!

248
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:53,384
Actually, l've chosen him
but he doesn't know.

249
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,717
You secretive little madam!

250
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,188
l'm here to seek your support!

251
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,748
l'm all ears, my dear.
Who is it?

252
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,794
Charly!

253
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,986
Which Charly?

254
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,966
Charles Brunner,
the one we all call Charly.

255
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,599
-You must be mad!
-l am, mad about him!

256
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,935
He doesn't have a situation.

257
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,441
What? He's the head of a school.

258
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:21,343
Oh, yes, the chief competitor
of the dada school,

259
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,441
the cubisto-cuneiform school,
known as coocoo for short.

260
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,419
Surely you don't plan
to set up house on income

261
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,853
from the coocoo school?

262
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,652
l have enough money for two!

263
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:36,089
Well, he is a very sweet boy.

264
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,124
l was simply exposing
the rational objections,

265
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,396
but l have nothing
against cubism...

266
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:47,261
and l love to handle
matters of love.

267
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,774
-That's quite rare for a...
-Stop.

268
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,903
You were going to say
for an old maid.

269
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,140
l hate that term.
Firstly, l'm not old...

270
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,876
and if l'm still a maid,
it's against my will.

271
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,045
But enough of that.

272
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,988
l'll talk to Charly
for you, l promise.

273
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,012
Without naming me.

274
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,319
l can imagine...

275
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,591
Here's my sister at last.

276
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,230
Yes, Juliette, you're late

277
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,362
and l can't abide people
who are late.

278
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,566
She's the one accusing others
of being late now.

279
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,131
Hello, Huguette!

280
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,699
Where the devil have you been?

281
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,143
l was just at
the Spherists' exhibition,

282
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,702
the Supercubists...
very crowded.

283
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,180
You could have let me know.

284
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,513
l called you,
but you had already left.

285
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,212
Charly took me.

286
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,447
ls Charly well?

287
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,820
He saw me all the way home.

288
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,791
He could have come up,
the ill-mannered little lout!

289
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:43,226
He had an urgent appointment,
with some floozy, l think.

290
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,262
Are you leaving because of me?

291
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,271
No, because of the floozy.

292
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:56,331
No. l left mother in limbo
at the seamstress's.

293
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,039
We're expecting you
for dinner tonight.

294
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,052
l know.
See you later, Gilberte.

295
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,549
You won't forget?

296
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,251
You can count on me.

297
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,723
What a way
to receive your guests.

298
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,321
lf l hadn't been here...

299
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,624
lt completely slipped my mind.

300
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,435
Were there many
of the usual bores here today?

301
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,838
Just Huguette Verberie
and Faradel.

302
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,342
-Faradel gets on my nerves.
-Why?

303
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,572
Because he keeps
suggesting a rendezvous.

304
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,739
What about Charly,
your other admirer?

305
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,271
Now he's much more respectful.

306
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,876
He simply suggests
his friend's opium den.

307
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,012
That's the same thing.

308
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,852
l'd like admirers
who remain admirers.

309
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,923
l have no desire
to make them my lovers.

310
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:53,963
Why take on a lover

311
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,557
lt's a bother

312
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,995
l don't need the worry

313
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,803
l'm not sorry

314
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:08,242
But flirting has no importance

315
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,511
That way you keep your distance

316
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,747
l have two suitors, true

317
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:18,018
But l could never choose
between the two

318
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:22,985
Since l don't wish
to pick sides

319
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,623
lt's my husband who decides

320
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,724
He's the one through
and through

321
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:36,037
With whom my heart resides

322
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:46,644
l'd love my husband so,
as a lover, you see

323
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:52,123
l so like to think he could be

324
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,093
And at night

325
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,959
When he comes

326
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,931
To nestle

327
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,455
By my side

328
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:07,336
l hide those feelings
deep, deep inside

329
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:13,769
Dreaming of those times
when we make love

330
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:18,044
l cheat against my will

331
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:22,247
l may cheat
but l'm his far and above

332
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:30,718
And l feel such a heady thrill

333
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:37,032
l'd love my husband

334
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:41,335
So, as a lover, you see

335
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:51,715
Tenderly, ardently,
so madly

336
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,085
Now you're quibbling.

337
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,350
Well, l love my husband.

338
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,789
-He's enough for me!
-Right.

339
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,918
Valandray's a good man,

340
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,655
much better than your
first husband, Eric Thomson.

341
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,392
Really, Arlette,
do you have to mention him?

342
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,558
Let sleeping dogs lie!

343
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,964
Didn't you love Mr. Thomson?

344
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,400
No!

345
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,063
Why did you marry him, then?

346
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,401
l was curious.

347
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,703
We were in America and that
American intrigued me,

348
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,641
like a wild animal to be tamed.

349
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:21,874
lt isn't wise to train someone
that way in matters of love.

350
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,609
Poor Thomson!

351
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,082
What's become of him?

352
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,141
Still no news?

353
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,982
Really. lf ever my present
husband were to find out--

354
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,854
That's right, he has his own
particular ideas about marriage!

355
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,290
He wants to be a trailblazer.

356
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:39,289
Some people prefer to dwell
in new apartments!

357
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:44,496
Luckily, she forgot to have
the marriage authenticated

358
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:47,198
under French law by
our consul in Chicago.

359
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,639
Without whom, l'd never have
become Madame Valandray.

360
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,768
And that would have been a pity.

361
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,971
Your husband's quite charming!

362
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,739
Yes, he leaves me totally free

363
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,444
and indulges my every whim.

364
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,549
-How's his business doing?
-Wonderfully!

365
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,025
The metal works are booming

366
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,495
and he's on the verge
of signing a marvellous deal.

367
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,963
The dressmaker has just sent
a dress round.

368
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,193
Good, put it in my room.

369
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,360
My dress for tonight's
dinner party.

370
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,393
l have to write a note
for Huguette.

371
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,904
She wants to marry.

372
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,565
-So young?
-She's in love.

373
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,302
l thought she was
more modern than that.

374
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,775
With Charly.

375
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,744
Really!
Poaching on my territory!

376
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,269
She had no idea
she was trespassing.

377
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:32,181
She can have that small fry.
l prefer bigger game.

378
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,254
Young Charly?
Small fry?

379
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:39,348
More of a little monkey,
l'd say.

380
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,518
l must write to the boy.

381
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,198
''My dear Charly...

382
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:53,435
''l'm very curious...

383
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,704
about Spherist art.''

384
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,138
lt's you, Georges!

385
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,148
ls Gilberte home yet?

386
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,449
She's in her room,
trying on a new dress.

387
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,546
A serious undertaking
that mustn't be disturbed.

388
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,115
Here we are.

389
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,728
lt wasn't easy, believe me.

390
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,026
Hello.

391
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,930
Hello, Faradel.
You seem rather agitated.

392
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,764
-Not at all.
-Yes, you do!

393
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,633
-What's the matter?
-Nothing, old chap.

394
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:28,231
l just popped in to say hello.

395
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,241
l've heard that before.

396
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,541
Those words never quite mean
what they say.

397
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,473
So there you are slaving away

398
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:38,813
Like each day

399
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,876
Without one minute to waste

400
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,113
ln true haste

401
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,179
When you have the sudden visit

402
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,815
So be it

403
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,656
Of an unwelcome twit

404
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,321
He doesn't see
from your ruddy blush

405
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,193
You're in a rush

406
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,755
He says as with an air so sweet

407
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,733
He takes as seat

408
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:59,134
l just popped in to say hello

409
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,572
To see how you are
in life's mad whirl

410
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,200
My youngest girl

411
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,870
Such a pearl

412
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,674
Has learnt to stitch and sew

413
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,374
Top of her class, you know

414
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:12,815
l just popped in to say hello

415
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:16,378
And there he stays on
as you glower

416
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,048
Hour by hour

417
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,853
Like a cold shower

418
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:23,760
He just popped in
to say hello

419
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,888
You'll be two long months away

420
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,228
People say

421
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,325
But you hurry home in a blur

422
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,596
Earlier

423
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,695
As a surprise in this life

424
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,035
Of harsh strife

425
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:37,041
For your dear wife

426
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,804
She's in bed on a sunny day

427
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,402
But she's at play
With your best friend

428
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,276
lt's so risqué

429
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,941
You hear him say

430
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:47,440
l just popped in to say hello

431
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:50,819
And then you lash out
like a thug

432
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,653
At the mug

433
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,352
Of that poor fellow

434
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:58,420
Who just popped in
to say hello

435
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,926
Why all the song and dance?

436
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,860
Do you suppose that one day,
l, in a bed with your wife--

437
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,498
lt's what you desire,
but it will never happen.

438
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,838
l'll leave you...

439
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,969
No, please, stay, l insist.

440
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,970
Faradel, you're
courting my wife.

441
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,915
-l protest!
-Don't get carried away.

442
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:22,079
You court her
and yet l'm not jealous.

443
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,747
Do you know why, Faradel?

444
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,848
How can l possibly answer
such an absurd question?

445
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,688
Because you trust Gilberte.

446
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,387
True.

447
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:32,329
But because that trust
is based on scientific facts.

448
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,265
Scientific fidelity?
What do you mean by that?

449
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,293
l could never marry
a widow or a divorcée

450
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,999
even if l adored her.

451
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,506
l know, that's one
of your fixations.

452
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:47,069
No, not a fixation, merely
the application of a theory,

453
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,603
the practical implementation
of a system.

454
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:53,641
l work in metals and l truly
believe that marriage,

455
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:57,177
or rather the first
conjugal act,

456
00:20:57,222 --> 00:21:00,123
is like everything else here
in this world of ours,

457
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,991
a matter of chemistry.

458
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,086
What is he going on about?

459
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:07,792
This is already way beyond you.
l'm speaking to Arlette.

460
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,700
The union of two beings is
like the fusion of two metals.

461
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,727
There are all kinds
of precautions and rules.

462
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,968
lf not, you end up
with flaws or bubbles.

463
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:21,002
And adultery is the logical
result of a primeval bubble.

464
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:24,140
lt depends on how the crucible
is heated on the wedding night.

465
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:27,447
lf the imprint is made
on pure flesh,

466
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,249
with all the right
technical precautions,

467
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,017
well then,

468
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,923
the imprint is indelible
and the woman is marked for life

469
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,951
by the seal of the male
who first possesses her.

470
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,862
She will never be
unfaithful to him.

471
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,331
l can tell you, Faradel,

472
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,630
''Court my wife as much
as you like.

473
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,365
lt entertains her
and amuses me.''

474
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,394
What a fellow...

475
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,203
and to think l was going
to take this seriously.

476
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,509
-But you've gone and given me--
-What's wrong?

477
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:58,243
Nothing. When l get emotional,
it gives me hiccups.

478
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:01,616
l'm so easily impressed.
l'll soon get over it.

479
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,052
Get dressed for dinner.

480
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:07,422
You're running out of time.
l'll do likewise.

481
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,450
See you later, Mademoiselle.

482
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:14,491
Poor Faradel, he must have
a faulty imprint.

483
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:14,633
Let's finish this letter.
''My dear Charly.

484
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,397
Let's finish this letter.
''My dear Charly.

485
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,802
''l'm very curious
about Spherist art.

486
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,863
''Would you be kind enough
to send me an invitation?

487
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,374
''Even better, bring me
the invitation

488
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,137
and then you can go with me.''

489
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,838
Monsieur Charles Bruner!

490
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,573
Show him in!

491
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,309
How wonderful!
My letter has already arrived.

492
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,414
-l'm delighted to see you.
-Not as much as l am, Charly.

493
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,118
How is your Coocooism
school doing?

494
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,285
Wonderfully well.

495
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:45,490
My latest field is total art.

496
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,192
My goodness!
You certainly stop at nothing!

497
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:51,532
Or, if you prefer,
lyrico-symphonic art.

498
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,300
Anyway, l've painted a picture,

499
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:57,137
composed a symphony
and written a poem.

500
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,836
These three works form a whole:

501
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,606
one is impossible
without the other two.

502
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,078
The Holy Trinity!

503
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:05,083
Could we descend from such
lofty heights for a second?

504
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:06,982
-Lofty heights?
-Let's be down to earth.

505
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,612
Surely you're not counting on
this poetico-balsamic painting

506
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,952
to make you rich?

507
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,855
But, well,
l'm bringing you riches.

508
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,354
ln what form?

509
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,126
-A matrimonial one.
-l beg your pardon?

510
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,225
A charming young woman,
excellent dowry

511
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,828
and huge expectations.

512
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,499
Then l don't understand.

513
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,201
She loves you, good Lord.

514
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,042
You're serious.

515
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,382
l thought it was a joke.

516
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,785
-Someone wants to marry me?
-ls that a rejection?

517
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,722
A categorical
and downright rejection.

518
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,987
You don't know
what you're missing.

519
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,897
-Tell me her name.
-Not on your life.

520
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,967
lf she loves me,
l have the right to know her.

521
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,842
l can offer her some form
of compensation.

522
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,608
Don't even think about it.

523
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,912
At poker, when you pass,

524
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,248
does the other player
show you his cards?

525
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,585
Arlette? What do you think?

526
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,616
Charly! l didn't know you
were already here.

527
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:21,990
lt's exquisite!

528
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,086
-lt suits you.
-Do you think so?

529
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,657
You wear it admirably well.

530
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:29,360
l'm delighted to have
the authorization of an artist.

531
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,336
-And a demanding artist at that.
-l imagine you are!

532
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,339
After all, he is the head
of a cubisto-cuneiform school.

533
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:37,136
Make fun of me, l don't mind.

534
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,904
lt's all publicity.

535
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,845
What do l care,
as long as they talk about me?

536
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,711
Dadaism is over and out

537
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,579
Cubism's had its day

538
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,482
Nowadays without a doubt

539
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,214
Coocooism's the way

540
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,983
All these faddish art schools

541
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,887
And their frantic need to be

542
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,619
They're foolish food for fools

543
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,490
Fatuous, freakish flummery

544
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,964
Publicity, see

545
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,693
When they follow a fad
lt's mad

546
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,701
lt makes them glad

547
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:07,296
Publicity, see

548
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,204
Wield your clout
Pout and spout

549
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,072
Get talked about

550
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:14,772
Publicity, see

551
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,610
Don't go without
Don't be a lout

552
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,115
Get talked about!

553
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,113
l have to go dress for dinner.

554
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,144
Think about
that poker game of mine.

555
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,918
There's still time
to raise the stakes.

556
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,424
l never play.

557
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,427
-You worry me!
-Why?

558
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:32,055
Because children need
to be playful.

559
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,825
lt annoys you
when people call you a boy.

560
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:36,856
Yes!

561
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:40,269
You'll get over it.
Cigarette?

562
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:42,903
Please.

563
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,340
Thank you.

564
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:55,343
So, what was that game
my sister was talking about?

565
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,355
lt's not a game,
it's a match.

566
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,787
-And when's the wedding day?
-What wedding?

567
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,127
Yours.

568
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:10,191
ln another twenty years.
Girls don't interest me.

569
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:13,830
So who does interest you?

570
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:17,471
You do. And you know it.

571
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,508
And why is that?

572
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:26,616
lt can't be explained.

573
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,613
First of all, there's
something strange about you.

574
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,885
At times you make fun of me,

575
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,893
yet at others you listen to me
with something akin to sympathy.

576
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:36,916
l do?

577
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,429
You feel a sort of attraction.

578
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:41,694
Darling. You attract me.
lt's irresistible.

579
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:46,731
Deny it all you like.
l've sensed it clearly.

580
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,972
And when we dance a tango...

581
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,637
you're not unhappy
to press against me.

582
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,046
Charly, my boy,
l'm going to throw you out.

583
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,875
Do you know what you are?

584
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,911
-You're a tease.
-lmpossible!

585
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,583
You enjoy having men around
to arouse,

586
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,684
but you never intend
to give yourself to them.

587
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:11,821
lndeed, l don't give,
you'll have to come back.

588
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:18,035
Too bad if l can no longer
contain myself.

589
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,798
Gilberte,
it's your entire fault.

590
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:25,036
-Gilberte.
-Lord, what's come over you?

591
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:27,169
You foolish boy.
Get your paws off me.

592
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:34,378
Don't try that again
or we'll no longer be friends.

593
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,587
Please, forgive me,
it won't happen again.

594
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:40,489
Just like a child.
lt won't happen again.

595
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,049
You bad boy!

596
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,816
Again!

597
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,193
Ah, Charly.

598
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:49,223
l don't wish to send you packing
but you barely have time

599
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,792
to run off home
before coming back, kid.

600
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,360
l'll hurry.

601
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:04,910
You'll see who's the kid
when l give your wife one!

602
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:06,418
Here you are at last!

603
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,545
Here you are at last!

604
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:10,213
l was about to say
the same thing.

605
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,882
Say hello first.

606
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:12,981
All right.

607
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,223
Hello, darling.

608
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:18,589
How placid!

609
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:21,398
Conjugal.

610
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,196
That's what l'm saying.

611
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,526
You haven't noticed anything?

612
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,095
Noticed what?

613
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,509
My dress, for Heaven's sake!

614
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,044
Yes. lt's very nice!

615
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,884
You hadn't even noticed it.
That's conjugal too!

616
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,394
l love you in any dress,
and all the more without.

617
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,362
That's better!

618
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,132
Will dinner be good?

619
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,691
l hope so!

620
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,068
lt happens to be
of capital importance for me.

621
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,539
l have an unexpected guest,
a surprise for you.

622
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:04,899
Why?

623
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,604
lmportant news.

624
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,475
Our fortune increased
tenfold, perhaps.

625
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,674
-Lovely!
-Once our overseas guest tonight

626
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:13,309
signs the prepared contract
after dinner,

627
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:15,649
the whole American market
will open up to me.

628
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:16,847
Well!

629
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,480
You'll have your pearls
as dessert.

630
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,718
What a delightful husband
you are.

631
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,192
l believe l am.

632
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,821
Oh, let's not exaggerate.
You have one serious failing.

633
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,558
Which is?

634
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,691
You never tell me
that you love me.

635
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,159
But you know l do!

636
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:33,329
That doesn't matter.
l could forget.

637
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,438
Silly child!

638
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,506
Are we not blessed, dear?

639
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,710
Yes!

640
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:49,379
And do you ever wish to go?

641
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,512
No!

642
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,519
Such exquisite tranquillity!

643
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:58,257
True, l have never known
such calm and immobility!

644
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:02,824
lt's better than futility

645
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,628
My love for you is not a whim

646
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,433
lt's dim!

647
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,235
ls that all that you could find?

648
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:10,434
You're blind!

649
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,274
But Gilberte,
you're my true love!

650
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,006
Those words have such
a sweet tempo

651
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:18,015
They're wonderful
to hear, you know!

652
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:22,850
Must l repeat them,
Heavens above?

653
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:35,662
Talking about it
is not what you do

654
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,364
When a sweet love is true

655
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:48,101
You stay silent
beneath the skies

656
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:52,640
And let love speak out
through your eyes

657
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:59,620
lf we want love to last

658
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:01,147
Vast

659
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:06,152
Then our words must be few

660
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,824
True

661
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,891
All words must be small

662
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:12,425
Just a kiss, that's all

663
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,062
All

664
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:16,039
Withal

665

ln thrall

666
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,610
You see my silence as a plot!

667
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,910
What?

668
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:26,950
While endearments make you swoon

669
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,111
Goon!

670
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,779
Lying's an easy thing to do

671
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,619
When a man's as silent as you

672
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:35,285
A woman can't know what is true!

673
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:40,229
One kiss can give you a clue

674
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,324
Do you feel this love is sad?

675
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,267
Bad!

676
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:46,293
-You want love to effervesce?
-Yes!

677
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,400
Well, l find that worrying!

678
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,237
Your love must be
a constant thing

679
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,870
Forever bright and dazzling!

680
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:58,645
lt's not just some mad,
wild fling

681
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:07,923
Talking about

682
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:11,486
lt is not what you do

683
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:16,159
When a sweet love is true

684
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:24,237
You stay silent
beneath the skies

685
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:28,769
And let love speak out
through your eyes

You silly man.
You know l adore you.

695
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,438
-What about you?
-For words.

696
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:10,477
Just think, you're
my little wife, my very own.

697
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:15,919
Monsieur. Monsieur Zambeaux
is asking to see you.

698
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,086
Show him into my office.

699
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:20,120
My business lawyer's brought
the contract. Excuse me.

700
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,655
See you later, my millionaire.

701
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,967
-Juliette.
-Monsieur.

702
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,232
An American gentleman
will be arriving shortly.

703
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:28,966
Show him into
the small drawing room

704
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,872
and let me know right away.

705
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:34,435
Monsieur Eric Thomson,
an American.

706
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,071
Eric Thomson!

707
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,208
No, l can't have heard properly,
that's impossible!

708
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,592
What on earth's wrong?

709
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,117
What do you think of my dress?

710
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,686
The dress is what's wrong.

711
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:57,465
Do you have any idea whom
this dinner is in honour of?

712
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,663
Eric Thomson.

713
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,968
Eric Thomson?

714
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,065
Her first husband!

715
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:09,273
Yes, and Georges knows nothing
about my first marriage.

716
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:10,610
What's going to happen?

717
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:13,446
He expounded his ideas earlier,
it's all a matter of chemistry.

718
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:15,782
What are we going to do?

719
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,187
Pretend you've fallen ill all of
a sudden and take to your bed.

720
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:23,157
That's just putting off
the inevitable.

721
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:27,153
My second husband is about
to introduce me to my first.

722
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:29,564
You must speak to Eric first.

723
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,832
That's the door. lt's him.
You greet him, l'm too nervous.

724
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,840
Be eloquent.

725
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:49,478
l'll try but the fellow always
hated the very sight of me.

726
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,843
l can imagine
your surprise, Monsieur.

727
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:19,281
You didn't expect
to find me here?

728
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,542
l must admit that, myself.

729
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,989
You're looking very well.

730
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:31,051
l'm quite well myself, too,
thank you.

731
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:32,858
You're wondering
what l'm doing here?

732
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,023
Yes, l can tell,

733
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:36,499
seeing me here,
displaying such familiarity,

734
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,161
you're probably thinking
that l'm a member

735
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,567
of Monsieur Valandray's
inner circle.

736
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:42,869
Well. That's right.
l'm part of his family

737
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,967
and l shall now answer
the second question

738
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,274
that is burning your lips
and that you don't dare to ask.

739
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:51,372
You've always been
such a tactful fellow, Eric.

740
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:54,043
You don't mind me calling you
Eric after all this time?

741
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:59,321
Thank you, l expected nothing
less of your exquisite courtesy.

742
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,654
A drop of port?

743
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:02,984
Forgive me. ln my confusion,

744
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:05,325
l forgot how fond
you are of port.

745
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,263
l didn't offer you a glass.

746
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:11,466
Eric, how l so wish
we could clear up

747
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,901
this misunderstanding
between us,

748
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,700
there's no reason
for it anymore.

749
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:17,739
To your good health.

750
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:22,141
l was the cause
of your divorce, l know.

751
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,239
You found me to be a bit...

752
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,213
of a burden.

753
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:31,653
Say it, go on. l don't mind.

754
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,019
Can we bury the hatchet, Eric?

755
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,995
l see, you don't want
to mention it again.

756
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,557
Very well, that's that,
let's not mention it again.

757
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,569
Should l fetch
my sister for you?

758
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,199
You'll see her right away.

759
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,300
What a grouch!

760
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,882
-Have you told him?
-Not yet!

761
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,015
He hasn't opened his mouth.

762
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,353
Anyone would think he no
longer speaks a word of French.

763
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,157
Monsieur Thomson,
l have something to tell you.

764
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,537
l'm Monsieur Valandray's wife.

765
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:06,907
And so there's something
l must ask of you.

766
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,646
-lf you stay--
-What do you say?

767
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:10,483
-Do not betray
-What do you say?

768
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:12,318
-Our past today
-What do you say?

769
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:13,618
lt could be bad

770
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,055
-lt can be seen
-What do you mean?

771
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:17,720
-As go-between
-What do you mean?

772
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,593
-You're not serene
-What do you mean?

773
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,257
Oh, this is mad!

774
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,267
-ln God's name
-What do you want?

775
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,030
-Think of the shame
-What do you want?

776
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,798
-lt's not a game
-What do you want?

777
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,634
Don't be a cad

778
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,470
-lf he's au fait
-What do you say?

779
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,203
-ln the least way
-What do you say?

780
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:33,835
The consequences would be dire

781
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,004
Without a doubt

782
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,514
-He's just a lout!
-lt's a real snafu

783
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:41,245
You were married, true
But no one must ever know

784
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:43,185
-What do you mean?
-You're a has-been!

785
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,278
Husband number two

786
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,653
Could well misconstrue

787
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,386
lf you broke the status quo

788
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,291
-What do you want?
-Am l to blame?

789
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,625
lt's a real snafu

790
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,924
She wed after you

791
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,488
And the news could be a big blow

792
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,524
-What do you say?
-Lord, what a day!

793
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:58,830
ls this all for play?

794
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,336
His ''What do you say?''

795
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,863
l thought he'd
understand some way

796
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:04,897
He'll have to pay!

797
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,068
lt's a real snafu

798
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,475
You were married, true

799
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,105
But no one must ever know

800
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:12,138
-What do you mean?
-l'll take my aim!

801
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,377
Husband number two

802
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:14,679
Could well misconstrue

803
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:17,381
lf you broke the status quo!

804
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,321
-What do you say?
-Please go away!

805
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,018
lt's a waste of time

806
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:22,889
He reasons in rhyme!

807
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:23,916
lt's invo

00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,588
-What is it, veau?
-lt's invo

809
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:26,618
What is it veau?

810
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,063
l think it's involuntary

811
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,124
Or he's the slyest of us three

812
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,761
He's lost all his French,
you can see

813
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:36,398
What do you say?

814
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,873
Oh, go away!

815
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,245
Oh, you're already here?

816
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:53,386
No one informed me
of your presence

817
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:56,018
More an absence!

818
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,652
He's here, my dear

819
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:01,221
The introductions
have been done?

820
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:02,323
Well done!

821
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:03,424
Well done!

822
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:05,935
And he's met everyone!

823
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,598
Everyone, l must profess!

824
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,301
And so you've met my wife!

825
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,275
So let's see where we're all at!

826
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:22,046
Enough, let's leave it at that!

827
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:33,387
And here now are
our three dear friends

828
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,730
Huguette Verberie

829
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:40,462
Charly and Faradel

830
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,773
-How d'you do, cher Monsieur
-Cher Monsieur, how d'you do

831
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,332
How d'you do

832
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:54,841
l don't quite like his style

833
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:57,149
That's a Yankee profile?

834
00:40:57,188 --> 00:41:01,887
He could be from Carlisle

835
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,190
He's not that handsome

836
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,458
With his mug like a Hun

837
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:10,194
And he can't be much fun

838
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:15,695
You were dreaming of a real man

839
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:19,698
This one looks like
he could be called Anne

840
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:21,768
l like a different style

841
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,905
lt may seem futile

842
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:28,851
But that makes me smile

843
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,191
l am dying with hunger.

844
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,459
Lord knows what he needs
How he pleads

845
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,197
He needs it here and now!

846
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:49,695
What's he demanding?

847
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,471
He must be sucking on a plum
lt sounds so rum!

848
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,912
What's he demanding?

849
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,642
lf nature calls,
he shouldn't be shy

850
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,047
We don't wish to pry

851
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:05,420
l pray my husband
can't tell that l'm lying!

852
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:09,916
Oh, good Lord above,
l feel like dying!

853
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:13,461
Dinner is served.

854
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:19,098
All right
You see!

855
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:20,763
Hungry!

856
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:23,738
Here we are, our minds in havoc

857
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:26,038
While he's obsessed
by his own stomach

858
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:29,307
lt's a nice, light dinner,
just to say hello

859
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:32,543
A simple meal
with dainty trifles

860
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,016
Fresh cockles

861
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,678
Creamed morels

862
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,277
Smoked salmon from Oslo

863
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:38,948
And a fine Bordeaux

864
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:42,117
A nice, light dinner,
just to say hello

865
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:45,424
Grilled lobster
and a fat roast goose

866
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:46,986
Chocolate mousse

867
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,658
Nice and light, you know

868
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:51,998
A nice, light dinner,
just to say hello

869
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:55,403
lt's a nice, light dinner,
just to say hello

870
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:58,431
A simple meal
with dainty trifles

871
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,067
Fresh cockles

872
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,702
Creamed morels

873
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:05,272
Smoked salmon from Oslo
And a fine Bordeaux

874
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:08,376
A nice, light dinner,
just to say hello

875
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,855
Grilled lobster
and a fat roast goose

876
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,413
Chocolate mousse

877
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,015
Nice and light, you know

878
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:19,223
A nice, light dinner,
just to say hello

879
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:24,463
AND TEN DAYS LATER
AT 7:00 P.M...

880
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:28,298
MR. AND MRS. GEORGES VALANDRAY

00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,899
OF YOUR PRESENCE FRlDAY,
OCTOBER 30, 9:00 TO MlDNlGHT.

882
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,568
AN EXCERPT FROM
CHARLES BRUNNER'S PLAY

883
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,271
''PRlMlTlVE SOULS''
WlLL BE PRESENTED.

884
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:43,976
Get him something to drink.

885
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:46,148
Something nice and cold.
A cocktail.

886
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,214
Thank you, my dears.

887
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:48,383
No, slap him on the back.

888
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:52,225
Thank you, it will soon pass.
lt's nerves!

889
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:53,490
Give him a scare!

890
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,167
l hate this.

891
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:00,396
lt's not my fault.

892
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:02,530
Faradel, what are you
doing here?

893
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:03,972
What am l doing here?

894
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:06,169
Tonight's soirée,
l had an invitation.

895
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,871
To come and listen
to a new piece

896
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,105
by Monsieur Charles Brunner.

897
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,307
Well, hurry to your seat
in the hallway

898
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,816
and listen to the music
that sets the atmosphere.

899
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,519
But l have hiccups.

900
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,181
People will think it's jazz.
Off you go.

901
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,790
These artistic soirées!

902
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:27,794
Good Lord,
what a terrible headache!

903
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,891
Huguette, you can do
me a favour!

904
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:31,958
l'd be delighted!

905
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,630
l have to get all these young
ladies into their costumes.

906
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,230
Please seat the guests.

907
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:37,865
-Certainly, Mademoiselle!
-Mesdemoiselles!

908
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,933
We're rushed for time.

909
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,467
l'll take you through myself.

910
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,811
We're dressing in Madame
Valandray's bedroom. Follow me.

911
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,440
l much prefer that.

912
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:49,945
Well, he's very much at home!

913
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:54,219
He's so kind.
So active, so youthful!

914
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:55,987
Are you still as keen?

915
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,618
More than ever!

916
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:02,162
Bravo. Love is such
a beautiful thing!

917
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,232
Have you stepped in
on my behalf?

918
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:06,634
Of course!

919
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:07,864
And?

920
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,611
And then?

921
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:25,816
He refuses to listen.
But l didn't tell him your name.

922
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:28,015
Thank you.

923
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:35,193
ln that case,
l'll speak to him myself!

924
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,091
That's not really
the done thing.

925
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,365
But it's still the best way
to get results!

926
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,917
What a crush.
Such a mad scramble.

927
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:58,819
l thought that l'd never
be here on time.

928
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:01,825
Charly's painting is hanging
there in the large drawing room.

929
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:03,417
Yes, his total art!

930
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,985
Well, there was such a crowd
that l got jammed in.

931
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:08,190
You speak slang now?

932
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:12,225
lt's not slang. The way
Paris is going these days,

933
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,396
l'm afraid we're
all in the same boat!

934
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:16,564
On the avenue

935
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,871
l was speeding, in a stew

936
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,638
The cop on the plot
Tinpot despot

937
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:22,645
Fined me on the spot

938
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:26,046
On the street so wide
Traffic flowed from every side

939
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,710
Like an assault
Not through my fault

940
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,013
Grinding to a halt!

941
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:32,544
And so l found myself jammed in

942
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:36,218
The cop took it all right
on the chin

943
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,818
And despite his rank

944
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:39,761
My words were too frank

945
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,355
He gave a grin
Then took me in

946
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:43,195
l spent the night in the tank

947
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:46,669
And so l found myself jammed in

948
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:50,230
And my wife,
her poor mind in a spin

949
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:52,037
ln her stress
Called the press

950
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:53,838
And told them out of her wits

951
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:58,007
My husband's been
chopped to tiny bits

952
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:01,313
Since not so long ago
Paris has changed so

953
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:03,182
All her best sights
Full of Levites

954
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,051
And gruff Muscovites

955
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:08,387
Or with Spaniards
Camping out on the boulevards

956
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:10,222
Worse than Venice
Ancient Memphis

957
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,591
But it's not Paris!

958
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:15,064
And so we find ourselves
jammed in

959
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:18,499
By people their fortune
here to win

960
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:20,196
ln the bars
You've Magyars

961
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:22,296
With cashiers
From Algiers

962
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,034
From Vadodara
Or from Ankara

963
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:25,701
We'll end up with cholera

964
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:29,178
And so we find ourselves
jammed in

965
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:32,671
Sweep them out
before they settle in

966
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:33,705
They show gall

967
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,241
Take it all
While we sit by and just cry

968
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:40,120
Who'll get us out
of the jam we're in?

969
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:42,489
A man must never let himself
get jammed in!

970
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,060
What were you saying
about me this time?

971
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:48,326
My poor little Gilberte.
You're so nervous.

972
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,526
ls Thomson here yet?

973
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,797
l thought you'd ask me that.

974
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:56,135
Yes, l just saw him
at the buffet, where else?

975
00:47:56,173 --> 00:48:01,475
Excellent. Excuse me,
l need to have a word with him.

976
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:07,412
See that? lt's been that way
for a week now,

977
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,316
ever since Thomson got here.

978
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:10,980
They're always chasing after
one another.

979
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:12,386
They can't bear to be apart
for a minute!

980
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:14,913
You're proof that
they share the same tastes.

981
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:17,256
He has moved in here,
he takes all his meals here.

982
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:19,159
l see more of him now
than when we were married.

983
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:21,323
-And what's he like?
-Very polite.

984
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:23,390
So what are you
complaining about?

985
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:25,628
This. Watch.

986
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:29,002
He's like the police.

987
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,269
He's following me like a thief.

988
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,208
Or like the French President!

989
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,076
He saw l was with you,
so he turned away!

990
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:38,081
He's not likely
to be drawn to me!

991
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,383
l can't take anymore.

992
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,582
That music has
a totally numbing effect on me.

993
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:48,784
Dear me, Faradel,
are you deserting?

994
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:52,659
My neighbours keep complaining
that my hiccups annoy them.

995
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:54,391
-Some people are leaving.
-What?

996
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,730
You're driving our guests away.
l must stop them.

997
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,965
At last, alone with you.

998
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:03,472
Oh, no, Faradel,
spare me your declarations.

999
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:07,534
You've been giving me the cold
shoulder for two weeks now.

1000
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:10,137
Everything l do is wrong.
Everything l think.

1001
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,080
Don't exaggerate.
You don't think!

1002
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:15,312
Yes, l do, l think that you
really must come

1003
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:18,185
to that little ground floor flat
l've prepared for you!

1004
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:20,519
lt won't see me for a long time.

1005
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:22,989
You're so cruel.

1006
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:25,927
During the day, l only ever
undress at my couturier's.

1007
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:29,023
But a fitting with you, well,
l can't quite see that.

1008
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:33,000
l merely need to imagine
the look on your face.

1009
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:38,066
Your face. Then, when you...

1010
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:41,168
l'm cured of the notion of
adultery before even trying it.

1011
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:46,012
You're like a Member
of Parliament:

1012
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:48,074
you promise the moon
when you're a candidate

1013
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:50,484
but everything withers away
once you're in the chamber.

1014
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:56,985
l'm delighted to see
Monsieur Faradel.

1015
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:58,551
So am l, Monsieur Thomson!

1016
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:01,723
l am particularly pleased
to see Monsieur Faradel.

1017
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,164
The pleasure's mutual,
Monsieur Thomson!

1018
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,395
You please me enormously.

1019
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:07,096
l would never have guessed.

1020
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:10,629
l'll leave you.
l have to get into my costume.

1021
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,039
He's been listening again.

1022
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:16,841
l must get rid of the man!

1023
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,180
And l want to give you
a word of advice, dear old boy.

1024
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:23,742
Sit down.

1025
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:28,149
ln America, when a deal is...

1026
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,523
what's the word...

1027
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,018
when someone's
drowning, their head...

1028
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:35,053
Goes under!

1029
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:36,690
That's it, goes under.

1030
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:42,000
ln America,
when a deal goes under,

1031
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,735
we never push the issue,
we forget it.

1032
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:48,606
-And you're right!
-You think so?

1033
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:52,308
So if you think so,
why keep at it?

1034
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,909
l keep at it.
Yes, it's a waste of time.

1035
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:57,146
You might miss other
interesting deals.

1036
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,754
l don't quite follow you.

1037
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:07,054
When a woman doesn't
want to go to bed,

1038
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:10,225
there are so many others who
love to slip between the sheets.

1039
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:12,258
You deprive them.

1040
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:14,566
Do you understand,
my dear fellow?

1041
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:15,662
Not a word!

1042
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:20,904
Yes, you do understand.
Leave that person alone.

1043
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:25,608
l feel remarkably fond of you.

1044
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:28,948
l wouldn't want to have to give
you advice every day.

1045
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:30,577
You understand, my old fellow.

1046
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:35,917
Thank you. Thank you.
You slapped me on the back.

1047
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:38,792
That's cleared up my hiccups.

1048
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,387
l've been de-hiccuped!

1049
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,241
Here he is at last.
Hello, Sam.

1050
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,615
My name is Eric.

1051
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:08,647
But back there,
l always called you Sam.

1052
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:11,889
You don't remember? l thought it
was nicer, more American.

1053
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:14,192
Here, it's another
kettle of fish.

1054
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:15,459
Why are you talking
about fish?

1055
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:17,524
An English saying.

1056
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:20,001
l see. l'll answer
with a few French sayings

1057
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:21,333
to clear everything up.

1058
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:23,498
lndeed.

1059
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,065
-Don't wake a sleeping cat.
-Because?

1060
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:27,906
Because it has claws.

1061
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:29,969
-What's done is done.
-So you think!

1062
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:32,709
Don't disturb
a very happy marriage.

1063
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:36,014
You don't always have
what you dream of in life.

1064
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:39,215
Alas, l know
what l'm talking about.

1065
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:43,188
At times, you need to be content
with what you have.

1066
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:51,525
l've often dreamt
like all the girls

1067
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:56,938
Of cuddling here on my knee

1068
00:52:56,973 --> 00:53:00,374
A baby with pretty blonde curls

1069
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:06,315
However that never came to be

1070
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,876
And now here l am an old maid

1071
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,380
Well, not old,
a slip of the tongue

1072
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:19,726
For l'm not that starchy
and staid

1073
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:25,030
And this heart of mine
is still young

1074
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:29,300
lt's younger than yours is now

1075
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:33,901
But since it's young
with no design

1076
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:38,506
l spoil others' children anyhow

1077
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:45,920
Wishing so that they were mine

1078
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:57,592
When you cannot have
what you love

1079
00:53:57,634 --> 00:54:06,565
Treat what you already
have with love

1080
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:12,414
Just try to be content

1081
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:16,351
With the lot you've been sent

1082
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:28,696
When you cannot have
what you love

1083
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:34,401
You're not a bad girl,
Mademoiselle Poumaillac.

1084
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,634
And you're not a bad boy
either, Thomson.

1085
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:38,732
Come, come, Sam,

1086
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:41,243
you're just excessively shy,
l know you well.

1087
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,768
And you're afraid of women.

1088
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:53,850
-That's--
-But why?

1089
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:58,487
lt happened when l was knee high
to a grasshopper!

1090
00:54:58,528 --> 00:54:59,654
A grasshopper?

1091
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:05,259
Yes, just a little boy.
Tiny, in short pants.

1092
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:09,102
One day, my schoolmistress
kissed me on the lips.

1093
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,470
They do that in America, too?

1094
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:15,410
Oh, a lot. lt created such an
incredible revolution within

1095
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:17,470
that l swore never
to let another woman

1096
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:19,379
lay her lips on mine.

1097
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:20,678
Seriously!

1098
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:23,880
l don't usually laugh
about sad things.

1099
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,751
So you were married
to Gilberte for six months

1100
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:28,485
and never once exchanged such
a kiss, the prelude to love?

1101
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:29,685
Never!

1102
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:32,058
-Well, you're quite something.
-l am!

1103
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,689
-You did have other kisses?
-Oh, l had everything!

1104
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:37,427
But not on the lips,
it's not hygienic.

1105
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:40,095
You poor man, perhaps that's
what led to your divorce.

1106
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:45,707
But that's all over now
and you shouldn't be

1107
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:48,074
such a regular fixture
in your successor's home.

1108
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:49,100
Why not?

1109
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:50,669
l'm staying.

1110
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:54,844
And l'm happy to see you, too,
you're a dear old thing.

1111
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:57,546
Let me shake your hand.

1112
00:55:57,587 --> 00:55:59,953
There's something charming
about this fellow.

1113
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,499
He's charming
but l must find a way

1114
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:11,727
to rid Gilberte of him.

1115
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:11,835
Oh, l know.

1116
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:13,826
Oh, l know.

1117
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,861
Huguette. Do you want
to marry a millionaire?

1118
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:17,236
-Me?
-Nothing easier.

1119
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:20,208
You just need to get Mr. Thomson
to kiss you on the lips.

1120
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:22,677
But, Mademoiselle, l have no
desire to marry a millionaire.

1121
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:23,804
l forgot.

1122
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:26,509
She's taken, but l'll set all
the other girls after him,

1123
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:27,982
and there are plenty.

1124
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:29,917
The freer they are,
the better.

1125
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:32,319
Oh, a Mexican!

1126
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:39,956
Total art. lt's frightening
just how total this boy is.

1127
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:46,464
You look magnificent!

1128
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,130
Kind of you to say so.

1129
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:51,633
So, you're going to perform.

1130
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:53,699
Yes, later on, with Gilberte.

1131
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:57,877
lt's a tableau taken from
my work ''Primitive Souls.''

1132
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,404
l know!

1133
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,350
Do you find Gilberte attractive?

1134
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:03,545
She's a woman who--

1135
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:06,384
Forget her, married women
aren't this year's fashion.

1136
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,754
They're out of date.

1137
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:10,517
Like Mademoiselle Poumaillac
you're trying to marry me off.

1138
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,549
Was she wrong to?

1139
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:14,188
Not her.
But the young woman who...

1140
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,926
Don't say anything
unpleasant, l know her!

1141
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:19,730
What madness came over her
to make her want to marry me?

1142
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:22,294
As a tender young girl, she
immediately thought of marriage.

1143
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:26,307
That would have been madness!

1144
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:29,709
But she figured it out!
She is not stupid!

1145
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,342
She was telling me
that a mayoral sash

1146
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:39,754
or a cassock aren't always
necessary to unite two beings.

1147
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:43,088
And that a girl can give herself
to the man she's chosen

1148
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,527
without a crowd of five hundred
to back her up.

1149
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:48,997
l'm sure you share her opinion
on that point.

1150
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,198
Not exactly!

1151
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,066
How can that be?

1152
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,502
lt's much better to remain
within the norm

1153
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:03,945
and follow the precepts
of traditional...morality.

1154
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,311
Meaning?

1155
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:08,614
Meaning...

1156
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:15,190
she could marry someone
who counts less for her and,

1157
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:18,353
once married, give herself
to the man of her choice

1158
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:21,158
with an affair that follows
the social norm.

1159
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:24,191
You can tell your friend that.

1160
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:26,327
All the same,
she'd have to be sure

1161
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:28,769
that the crumbs
will lead to the cake.

1162
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,073
The cake's telling you so.

1163
00:58:33,743 --> 00:58:35,973
Well then,
l'll give her the message.

1164
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:42,240
Marvellous!

1165
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:43,912
l adore this costume.

1166
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:49,683
lt might be wise to
rehearse one last time.

1167
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:52,286
Perhaps.
l do feel a little nervous.

1168
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:54,694
l'll leave you
to work in peace.

1169
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:56,494
Could you tell
the other young ladies,

1170
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,933
who must be in costume by now,
to enter on cue?

1171
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,060
All right.

1172
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:02,866
Of course,
it's easy for her.

1173
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:04,703
l don't dress up as a Mexican.

1174
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:05,730
Let's rehearse!

1175
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:09,211
Just a second.
Let me admire you first.

1176
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,345
ln that costume, l see you and
another woman at the same time.

1177
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,851
Gilberte, if only you'd--

1178
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:18,149
Soon you'll be offering
to show me

1179
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:19,677
your bachelor flat like Faradel.

1180
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,384
-Faradel has offered you...
-No, he hasn't.

1181
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:25,519
Let's get one thing clear:
l'll never be your mistress.

1182
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,860
But you allow me
to be your lover!

1183
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:32,459
Silly man. That's all over now.
Let's rehearse.

1184
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,431
Let's rehearse.

1185
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:41,709
Remember what l'm symbolizing
with ''Primitive Souls''?

1186
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,803
Love in the different races.

1187
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:45,006
Again!

1188
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:47,349
-What?
-Nothing.

1189
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,713
l must cure him of his spying.

1190
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:57,125
Go back to what you were
saying before.

1191
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,650
Before?

1192
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:00,424
-He claims he's in love.
-Talk about love?

1193
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:02,328
-Of course.
-But you just forbade me to!

1194
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:04,856
l'm allowing you to now, so...

1195
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:08,098
Just a second.
Let me gather my thoughts.

1196
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:12,499
Gilberte, if only you would,
for months now l've longed to.

1197
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:15,033
You know, on the day
you were married...

1198
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:18,241
-Warmer, warmer.
-l never mentioned this to you.

1199
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,771
Mention it, please, mention it.

1200
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:24,685
Gilberte, l desire you madly,
your pliant body.

1201
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:26,712
l'd make a wonderful
little lover,

1202
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:28,018
will you let me?

1203
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:30,287
Yes, l can tell you want that.

1204
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:37,029
How silly, l didn't find
that at all unpleasant.

1205
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,106
He's gone,
that's done the trick.

1206
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,040
-Enough now!
-l haven't even started.

1207
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:47,474
Come on, let's rehearse!

1208
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,343
You were saying that as Mexico
l represented...

1209
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,746
The last traces of the Redskins.

1210
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:58,018
-You're a young maiden.
-l like that idea.

1211
01:00:58,054 --> 01:01:01,148
And you love
this adventurer fellow

1212
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,817
who camps up in the mountains,

1213
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:05,327
the attraction of purity
for the rogue.

1214
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:06,726
And you're the rogue.

1215
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:08,094
That's me!

1216
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:11,398
All right, let's start.

1217
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:18,833
ln the Sierra,
the night replaces day

1218
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:22,538
You quietly come my way

1219
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:25,570
My heart just flies away

1220
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:34,085
Beneath tall palms,
in the aromatic night

1221
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:37,684
My resistance is slight

1222
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:41,891
And your sweet voice
takes flight

1223
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:45,267
People tell me

1224
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:48,270
You're cruel without a care

1225
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:50,465
But all l see

1226
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:53,669
ls love beyond compare
But l knew it

1227
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:59,106
l saw as we embraced

1228
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:01,616
That your jacket

1229
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:04,586
Now bore a bloody trace

1230
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:07,453
The other man died

1231
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,920
Oh, my sweet pride!

1232
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:15,059
ln joy l cried

1233
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:26,438
Oh, ecstasy divine!

1234
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:32,847
l'll build to you a shrine

1235
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:38,980
Your lips brush against mine

1236
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:44,118
With a kiss so sweet

1237
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:51,533
l fear but l submit

1238
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:57,699
And after l taste it

1239
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:04,407
My soul l do forfeit

1240
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:13,583
To this thrill so fleet

1241
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:23,529
Oh, ecstasy divine!

1242
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:29,630
l'll build to you a shrine

1243
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:35,474
Your lips brush against mine

1244
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:44,476
With a kiss so sweet

1245
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,286
-Gilberte.
-Farewell, Charly.

1246
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,158
What a woman!

1247
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,494
My blood's boiling.
l'll have her.

1248
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:58,122
Faradel.

1249
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:03,164
Faradel, just the chap.

1250
01:04:03,206 --> 01:04:06,039
Faradel, l'd like you to lend me
your bachelor flat.

1251
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,607
l need to arrange
a private meeting.

1252
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:13,411
She isn't the kind one can
simply summon to a hotel room.

1253
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:16,885
Faradel, a Don Juan
such as yourself

1254
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:18,546
must have a small bachelor flat.

1255
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:19,850
But l don't.

1256
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:21,186
l know you do.

1257
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:24,387
l mean, l used to have
a bachelor flat.

1258
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:27,191
My lease has been terminated
to rent it to some foreigner.

1259
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:29,994
What a bother!

1260
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,262
Today's the thirtieth.

1261
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:34,792
Tomorrow, the thirty-first,
is the last day.

1262
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:36,099
One day's all l need.

1263
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:37,366
We can manage it!

1264
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:39,101
Be my guest!

1265
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:41,905
You're a true brother and,
believe me, l'll treat the place

1266
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:44,242
as if you were receiving
your cherished one there.

1267
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,009
l'm sure you will!

1268
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:47,447
l'll put myself in your shoes.

1269
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:49,212
Sorry, but l'm afraid
l'll be in yours.

1270
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:52,278
That's right.
l'll see you later.

1271
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:56,587
This is exhausting. l'm in
a state of total excitement.

1272
01:04:58,494 --> 01:04:59,825
Did you rehearse well
with Gilberte?

1273
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:01,386
l certainly did.

1274
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,862
l'd like your advice.

1275
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,200
-My advice?
-Yes.

1276
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:11,206
l wish to attempt
to conquer Mr. Thomson.

1277
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,037
l want to get him to marry me.

1278
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,270
-Do you know why?
-l can guess.

1279
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:18,546
Apparently, all a girl
needs to do

1280
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,776
is convince him to kiss her
on the lips.

1281
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:21,805
That's all?

1282
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:24,342
That's all,
but l lack experience.

1283
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:27,550
What must a girl do
to get a man to kiss her?

1284
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,023
That's a tough one.

1285
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:32,154
lt's harder than you're told

1286
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:35,322
To charm a man
who's so very cold

1287
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:37,860
And that's true, you'll grant

1288
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,926
When a girl's a mere debutante

1289
01:05:41,804 --> 01:05:43,431
But what can you do

1290
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:46,498
When he tries hard
to ignore you?

1291
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:48,807
You'd do what you could

1292
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:50,175
To do any good

1293
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:52,680
To that lump of wood

1294
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:54,706
l could act like l'm effete

1295
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:57,014
Now that's quite sweet!

1296
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:00,180
l could act like a naiad

1297
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:02,247
Now that's not bad!

1298
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:06,053
Or perhaps to make a start

1299
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:08,893
l could play a young sweetheart

1300
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:11,627
As a saucy little tyke

1301
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:14,329
Now that l like!

1302
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:16,497
l could wear a suit that's neat

1303
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:18,404
Now that's quite sweet!

1304
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,968
To make me look like a lad

1305
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:24,241
Now that's not bad!

1306
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:28,005
Tell me now, what would you say

1307
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:30,644
lf my stocking pulls this way

1308
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:33,382
And shows a patch of skin?

1309
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:36,687
Now there you win!

1310
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:38,660
This is rather grand!

1311
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:41,424
Finding a student
who can understand

1312
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:44,160
lt's such a delight

1313
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,863
To look good
in your teacher's sight

1314
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:49,530
But remember now

1315
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:53,372
l'm just helping, you'll allow

1316
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:54,774
Let's see what you know

1317
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:56,175
Which to me you owe

1318
01:06:56,212 --> 01:06:58,442
Repeat anyhow

1319
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,711
l'll use a perfume
that's discreet

1320
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,877
Now that's quite sweet!

1321
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:06,277
Made with myrrh
from Old Baghdad

1322
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:08,381
Now that's not bad!

1323
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:12,024
l cover up my bosom

1324
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:14,894
Leaving his eyes to fathom

1325
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:17,455
Cleavage worthy of Vandyke

1326
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,367
Now that l like!

1327
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:22,598
Then he'll sweep me off my feet

1328
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:24,196
Now that's quite sweet!

1329
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:27,902
And with a kiss
l'll drive him mad

1330
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:30,070
Now that's not bad!

1331
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,942
l'll move close temptingly

1332
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:36,713
So when l'm in his arms
he'll see

1333
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:39,516
That my body's made for sin

1334
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:42,388
Now there you win!

1335
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:45,221
Good Lord,
l really must apologize!

1336
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,092
-There's no need!
-What came over me?

1337
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:48,790
Oh, do be quiet.

1338
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:51,197
Charly, what are you up to?
The ladies are asking for you.

1339
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:53,963
l'll go to them now.
l'd quite forgotten.

1340
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:56,403
Did you put him in such a state?

1341
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:58,134
l don't know.

1342
01:07:58,174 --> 01:07:59,368
Perhaps l did.

1343
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,640
Mr. Thomson seems to be
in a very bad mood.

1344
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:05,203
lndeed!

1345
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,044
This is no time to seduce him.

1346
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,244
Besides, perhaps
l no longer need to.

1347
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:12,078
You're not happy, Thomson,
my dear fellow?

1348
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:13,611
-No!
-You have a problem?

1349
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:15,146
-Yes!
-Business?

1350
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:16,351
-No!
-Romance?

1351
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:18,792
-Yes!
-Perhaps you should give up.

1352
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:20,318
-No!
-You're as stubborn as ever.

1353
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:21,351
Yes!

1354
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:24,093
-And talkative with it. Lord!
-Go away!

1355
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:25,464
Really!

1356
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:27,332
What's come over you
in the last hour or so?

1357
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:29,030
Ah! Thank heavens you're here.

1358
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:31,130
Mr. Thomson has just made
an utterly ridiculous comment.

1359
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:33,334
You're the one
who must go out, immediately.

1360
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:34,967
You must be crazy, Mr. Thomson.

1361
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:37,342
-l'm sorry. l have my reasons.
-What reasons?

1362
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:38,971
l'll tell you when the lady
l don't wish to see

1363
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:40,003
has gone ''out''.

1364
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:42,017
As soon as you apologize,

1365
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:44,212
l'll leave you with Gilberte,
if she so desires.

1366
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:45,914
Yes, you really must!

1367
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:47,684
Come on, let's hear an apology!

1368
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:55,692
Thank you and au revoir,
my friend, for we'll meet again.

1369
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:59,056
l'll put every nubile maiden
in the place after him.

1370
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:03,470
Speak, l'm waiting.

1371
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:06,006
lt's not easy!

1372
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:08,642
l'll get straight to the point.

1373
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:11,009
l saw a man kiss you
on the lips!

1374
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:12,035
And then?

1375
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:13,878
l don't know
what he kissed then.

1376
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:16,510
-ls that any business of yours?
-But...

1377
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:18,452
Yes, he's my lover.
What is it to you?

1378
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:19,476
Damn it.

1379
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:20,819
The cure is working.

1380
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:25,049
-Feeling better?
-No!

1381
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:31,030
Come, come, Eric.
Let's have a little chat.

1382
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:32,658
l want to!

1383
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:34,999
lf l understand correctly,
you still love me,

1384
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:36,766
or, rather, you love me anew.

1385
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:37,999
l think so too.

1386
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,304
You're a man of
rigid principles, Eric.

1387
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:43,243
And now l'm a fallen woman,
l have a lover.

1388
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,975
You must scorn me and
cast me aside, you must leave.

1389
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,277
Oh! This is terrible.

1390
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:49,580
l desire you even more
now that l know

1391
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:51,779
you have a lover,
a frolicsome woman.

1392
01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:55,783
l now want those lips of yours
that l always refused!

1393
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:57,792
-Really.
-Be silent. l demand it.

1394
01:09:57,826 --> 01:09:59,350
l'm an American.

1395
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:02,219
There you are.

1396
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:03,925
l've been looking for you
everywhere.

1397
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:06,664
What's the matter with him?

1398
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:08,329
These Americans are odd people.

1399
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,531
You can be having a perfectly
pleasant conversation

1400
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:12,370
and all of a sudden,
''good-bye.''

1401
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:13,636
He should leave for good.

1402
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:15,644
-Why?
-Because he's a pest.

1403
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:18,146
He's a foreigner,
he doesn't realize.

1404
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:19,670
Have you signed
your partnership agreement?

1405
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:20,704
Not yet.

1406
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:21,807
Then don't!

1407
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,818
Oh, very funny, l'd be turning
down an absolute fortune.

1408
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:27,646
Do we need so much money
to be happy?

1409
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:29,855
You desire

1410
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:31,860
Many things to acquire

1411
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:33,361
You'd buy me

1412
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:35,386
The finest jewellery

1413
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:36,989
Everything

1414
01:10:37,032 --> 01:10:39,057
Fur coats, a diamond ring

1415
01:10:39,101 --> 01:10:40,591
But, my dear

1416
01:10:40,636 --> 01:10:42,695
l don't need that l fear

1417
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,365
Love, it's true

1418
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:46,306
Needs just enough for two

1419
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:47,900
Happiness

1420
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:50,036
ls romance, nothing less

1421
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,546
After all

1422
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,207
Why seek out a windfall

1423
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:54,238
For indeed

1424
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:57,480
There's not a lot we need

1425
01:10:57,519 --> 01:10:59,214
We don't need a lot

1426
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:00,847
Really not a lot

1427
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:02,754
Just to be content

1428
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:04,554
With love's kind assent

1429
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:08,085
A meal that's frugal
but palatable

1430
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:11,861
As the saying goes,
it's delectable

1431
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,595
We don't need a lot

1432
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:15,365
Really not a lot

1433
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:17,099
A nice, narrow bed

1434
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:18,902
With a thick bedspread

1435
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:22,399
lf the bed is small,
we'll still be comfortable

1436
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:23,433
Not a lot

1437
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:25,879
Really not
We're pleased with our lot

1438
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:30,310
As you say

1439
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:33,185
To be in love today

1440
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,153
We don't need a lot

1441
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,920
Really not a lot

1442
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,587
Just to be content

1443
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:41,493
With love's kind assent

1444
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:42,690
lnstead of lunch

1445
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:44,528
l'll feed on your sweet caress

1446
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:48,662
That will satisfy us
more than hot bouillabaisse

1447
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:50,262
We don't need a lot

1448
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,137
Really not a lot

1449
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:53,903
This year it's likely

1450
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:55,773
Coal will be costly

1451
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:58,837
We'll stay abed warmed
by our own tenderness

1452
01:11:58,881 --> 01:12:00,041
Not a lot

1453
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:01,071
Really not

1454
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:03,209
We're pleased with our lot

1455
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:06,050
That's agreed then,
you'll send Thomson packing.

1456
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:07,612
Not on your life!

1457
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,426
What if l told you
he'd been courting me?

1458
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:18,296
l'd say it was a good thing.

1459
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,734
lt could make him more flexible
on the contract.

1460
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:22,031
Really!

1461
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:23,732
What?

1462
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:26,206
You're not likely to take him
as your lover, are you now?

1463
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:29,233
Georges, you're
too sure of yourself.

1464
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:30,575
Or just sure of you.

1465
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:32,170
So you're not at all jealous?

1466
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:34,213
Absolutely not!

1467
01:12:34,249 --> 01:12:35,807
There's no love
without jealousy.

1468
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:37,148
Only if you're mad,
which l'm not.

1469
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:40,747
Oh, no, you're
far too calm for that.

1470
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:42,256
You're a real noodle.

1471
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:44,324
Yes.

1472
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,055
l'd rather leave.
You exasperate me.

1473
01:12:48,797 --> 01:12:51,527
Having one husband who kicks up
a fuss when you don't love him

1474
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:53,364
and another who doesn't
when you do,

1475
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:55,029
well, it's frightful.

1476
01:12:57,606 --> 01:12:59,506
How can a woman tell
which way to turn?

1477
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:02,207
Women.

1478
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:04,337
Honestly, Gilberte.

1479
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:07,946
Monsieur Thomson,
you must pay a forfeit.

1480
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:09,780
-What?
-You wagered, you lost.

1481
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:12,252
-Oh, yes?
-You owe us a forfeit.

1482
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:15,822
We ask anything
that we want of you.

1483
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:17,155
And what do you want?

1484
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:19,621
A kiss on the lips.

1485
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:21,492
Oh! Never.

1486
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:24,998
People say they love kissing

1487
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,728
But it's not exciting

1488
01:13:26,769 --> 01:13:28,862
l find it disgusting

1489
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:31,935
Don't think
that l'm cold as ice

1490
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:33,669
But l don't think it's nice

1491
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:36,837
Like some unpleasant vice

1492
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:40,246
l don't know any miss

1493
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:43,809
Whom l'd let steal a kiss

1494
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:47,310
Please leave my lips
on the shelf

1495
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:50,655
l keep them to myself

1496
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,289
Just a kiss! Just a kiss!

1497
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:55,228
Just a kiss! Just a kiss!

1498
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:58,700
Not on the lips!

1499
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:00,395
Just a kiss! Just a kiss!

1500
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:02,267
Just a kiss! Just a kiss!

1501
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:05,899
My stomach flips

1502
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:09,399
Not on the lips

1503
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:13,211
His stomach flips!

1504
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:17,014
My lips are made for talking

1505
01:14:17,052 --> 01:14:19,452
Not for kissing

1506
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:21,111
Just a kiss!

1507
01:14:21,156 --> 01:14:22,748
Just a kiss! Just a kiss!

1508
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:23,780
Just a kiss!

1509
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:27,193
Not on the lips!

1510
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:28,924
Just a kiss! Just a kiss!

1511
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:30,727
Just a kiss! Just a kiss!

1512
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:34,395
Hands off my hips

1513
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:37,963
Not on the lips

1514
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:39,871
Elsewhere is fine

1515
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:41,466
Just a kiss! Just a kiss!

1516
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:43,239
Just a kiss! Just a kiss!

1517
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:46,304
These lips are only mine

1518
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,650
Up there on the silver screen

1519
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:52,483
Kisses can be seen

1520
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:55,422
ln every other scene

1521
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:57,755
On the screen,
their lips are glued

1522
01:14:57,793 --> 01:14:59,624
ln a kiss they ne'er conclude

1523
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:02,653
As the public shares the mood

1524
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:06,190
Well, l can't say l'm keen

1525
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:09,671
What happened to hygiene?

1526
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:13,163
lt's to me my germs belong

1527
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:16,371
l won't pass them along

1528
01:15:17,312 --> 01:15:19,007
Just a kiss! Just a kiss!

1529
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:20,981
Just a kiss! Just a kiss!

1530
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:24,474
Not on the lips!

1531
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,112
Just a kiss! Just a kiss!

1532
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:27,917
Just a kiss! Just a kiss!

1533
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:31,619
My stomach flips

1534
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:35,096
Not on the lips

1535
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:38,657
His stomach flips!

1536
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:42,500
My lips are made for talking

1537
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,403
Not for kissing

1538
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:47,570
Just a kiss! Just a kiss!

1539
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:49,600
Just a kiss! Just a kiss!

1540
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:52,910
Not on the lips!

1541
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:54,540
Just a kiss! Just a kiss!

1542
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:56,380
Just a kiss! Just a kiss!

1543
01:15:56,418 --> 01:16:00,081
Hands off my hips

1544
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:03,649
Not on the lips

1545
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:05,489
Elsewhere is fine

1546
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:07,188
Just a kiss! Just a kiss!

1547
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:08,958
Just a kiss! Just a kiss!

1548
01:16:08,997 --> 01:16:12,558
These lips are only mine

1549
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:18,570
These young French women.

1550
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:20,370
They're even more of a handful

1551
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,206
than their American
counterparts.

1552
01:16:25,312 --> 01:16:27,177
l'm glad to see you.

1553
01:16:27,214 --> 01:16:28,545
Why?

1554
01:16:28,582 --> 01:16:30,209
Sit down, my friend.

1555
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:35,781
You must throw
this Charly fellow out.

1556
01:16:35,823 --> 01:16:36,812
Really? Why?

1557
01:16:36,857 --> 01:16:38,154
He's always lurking
around your wife!

1558
01:16:38,192 --> 01:16:40,251
Keep an eye on him!

1559
01:16:40,294 --> 01:16:42,626
l have absolutely nothing
to fear there.

1560
01:16:42,663 --> 01:16:45,826
l am mathematically ensured
of Gilberte's fidelity.

1561
01:16:45,866 --> 01:16:47,925
My theory is irrefutable.
Let me tell you:

1562
01:16:47,968 --> 01:16:49,697
a woman belongs to the first man
who possesses her,

1563
01:16:49,737 --> 01:16:52,604
as long as he's neither a brute
nor a clumsy idiot.

1564
01:16:53,774 --> 01:16:56,368
She is his and will necessarily
return to him,

1565
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:58,105
even if life parts them.

1566
01:16:58,779 --> 01:17:00,371
She is marked by
the indelible imprint

1567
01:17:00,414 --> 01:17:02,177
of the man who
reveals her to herself.

1568
01:17:02,216 --> 01:17:07,654
Yes, like a developer
in photography.

1569
01:17:07,688 --> 01:17:08,848
That's why l fear nothing.

1570
01:17:08,889 --> 01:17:10,447
l was the first
in Gilberte's case.

1571
01:17:12,192 --> 01:17:14,160
You were first?

1572
01:17:15,496 --> 01:17:16,861
Quite obviously

1573
01:17:16,897 --> 01:17:19,866
and l believe l've been
an excellent developer.

1574
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:24,132
You don't say,
a developer and fixative.

1575
01:17:31,745 --> 01:17:33,975
l mention you and you happen by

1576
01:17:34,014 --> 01:17:36,346
Would you like to tell me why?

1577
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:38,476
He was saying
that he adored you, see

1578
01:17:38,519 --> 01:17:40,885
That's no secret, we agree

1579
01:17:40,921 --> 01:17:43,116
Why do you tell him
with such glee?

1580
01:17:43,157 --> 01:17:45,284
Before the bomb blows
we should flee

1581
01:17:45,325 --> 01:17:47,520
He can say it again, l decree

1582
01:17:47,561 --> 01:17:49,859
-That l took your virginity!
-What did you say?

1583
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:50,919
-Hey-hey!
-Don't say it so

1584
01:17:50,964 --> 01:17:52,192
-Hey-ho!
-That's not the way!

1585
01:17:52,232 --> 01:17:53,529
Hey-hey! That's not the way!

1586
01:17:53,567 --> 01:17:55,694
He says when you
became his wife

1587
01:17:55,736 --> 01:17:57,931
He was the first,
the first man in your life

1588
01:17:57,971 --> 01:17:59,165
Yes, l'm number one

1589
01:17:59,206 --> 01:18:00,298
Next to none

1590
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:01,432
And yet l am too

1591
01:18:01,475 --> 01:18:02,669
Oh, says who?

1592
01:18:02,709 --> 01:18:04,768
Oh, what can you do?
When you're number two!

1593
01:18:04,812 --> 01:18:05,870
For straight off you see

1594
01:18:05,913 --> 01:18:07,141
-Good old number three
-But we're not talking of me

1595
01:18:07,181 --> 01:18:08,239
That's just what we say

1596
01:18:08,282 --> 01:18:09,374
Say, say, what do we say?

1597
01:18:09,416 --> 01:18:10,508
After two there's three!

1598
01:18:10,551 --> 01:18:11,575
lt must be

1599
01:18:11,652 --> 01:18:13,745
lt can't be done
With three in the queue!

1600
01:18:13,787 --> 01:18:14,811
There's one too many

1601
01:18:14,855 --> 01:18:17,255
After two, there's three!

1602
01:18:17,291 --> 01:18:19,725
lt's no fun being the second

1603
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,160
He's so very old-fashioned

1604
01:18:22,196 --> 01:18:24,255
lf you're numbers one and three

1605
01:18:24,298 --> 01:18:26,596
That can really never be

1606
01:18:26,633 --> 01:18:28,726
All these numbers,
it's quite crazy!

1607
01:18:28,769 --> 01:18:30,862
Marriage is a lottery, you see

1608
01:18:30,904 --> 01:18:33,099
A lottery l once tried for free

1609
01:18:33,173 --> 01:18:34,765
While l had a winning spree

1610
01:18:34,808 --> 01:18:35,832
-What did you say?
-Hey-hey!

1611
01:18:35,876 --> 01:18:36,865
-Don't say it so
-Hey-ho!

1612
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:39,037
-That's not the way!
-Hey-hey! That's not the way!

1613
01:18:39,079 --> 01:18:41,343
He says when you
became his wife

1614
01:18:41,381 --> 01:18:43,576
He was the first,
the first man in your life

1615
01:18:43,617 --> 01:18:44,743
Yes, l'm number one

1616
01:18:44,785 --> 01:18:46,047
Next to none

1617
01:18:46,086 --> 01:18:47,178
And yet l am too

1618
01:18:47,221 --> 01:18:48,210
Oh, says who?

1619
01:18:48,255 --> 01:18:50,280
Oh, what can you do?
When you're number two!

1620
01:18:50,324 --> 01:18:51,348
For straight off you see

1621
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,551
Good old number three

1622
01:18:52,593 --> 01:18:54,652
-That's just what we say
-Say, say, what do we say?

1623
01:18:54,695 --> 01:18:55,753
After two there's three!

1624
01:18:55,796 --> 01:18:56,956
lt must be

1625
01:18:56,997 --> 01:18:59,124
lt can't be done
With three in the queue!

1626
01:18:59,166 --> 01:19:01,225
There's one too many
After two, there's three!

1627
01:19:01,268 --> 01:19:02,394
When your love is true

1628
01:19:02,436 --> 01:19:03,767
ls this the same old song?

1629
01:19:03,804 --> 01:19:05,795
-The same old song!
-He's insisting and he's wrong!

1630
01:19:05,839 --> 01:19:07,704
You know what's done is done
And my love you have won

1631
01:19:07,741 --> 01:19:09,902
The man who's number one
Can the others outrun

1632
01:19:09,943 --> 01:19:12,070
l know what's done is done
And your love l have won

1633
01:19:12,112 --> 01:19:14,080
The man who's number one
Can the others outrun

1634
01:19:14,114 --> 01:19:16,446
-Oh really, for Heaven's sake
-Why for Heaven's sake?

1635
01:19:16,483 --> 01:19:18,713
-You expose my life like a rake?
-Oh no, he's not a rake

1636
01:19:18,752 --> 01:19:20,879
-l feel my very marrow shake!
-That's a big mistake

1637
01:19:20,921 --> 01:19:22,946
-My nerves are all a-quake
-Some ether she should take

1638
01:19:22,990 --> 01:19:23,979
l don't feel so odd

1639
01:19:24,024 --> 01:19:25,218
-God!
-What now, dear God?

1640
01:19:25,259 --> 01:19:26,487
lt's nerves, you can tell

1641
01:19:26,527 --> 01:19:28,427
-As clear as a bell
-No need for eau-de-vie!

1642
01:19:28,462 --> 01:19:29,690
As we can all see

1643
01:19:29,730 --> 01:19:31,755
-l'm as good as new
-She's as good as new

1644
01:19:31,798 --> 01:19:32,787
She's as good as new

1645
01:19:32,833 --> 01:19:34,061
But what's this to-do

1646
01:19:34,101 --> 01:19:35,261
-She's uneasy too
-What is it?

1647
01:19:35,302 --> 01:19:36,291
-Do l misconstrue
-What is it?

1648
01:19:36,336 --> 01:19:38,566
-lt's so impromptu!
-What is it?

1649
01:19:38,605 --> 01:19:40,505
-He looks right through you
-Really, what can l do?

1650
01:19:40,541 --> 01:19:42,941
-lt's as if he knew
-She's interrupting me too!

1651
01:19:42,976 --> 01:19:44,910
His suspicions accrue
l shudder anew

1652
01:19:44,945 --> 01:19:47,038
While he sticks like glue
After my virtue!

1653
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,274
Yes, l'm number one

1654
01:19:48,315 --> 01:19:49,339
l'm second to none

1655
01:19:49,383 --> 01:19:50,475
But what would l do

1656
01:19:50,517 --> 01:19:51,506
Were l number two?

1657
01:19:51,552 --> 01:19:53,645
For what can ensue
lf you're second too

1658
01:19:53,687 --> 01:19:55,848
l bore his name, too
After all, it's true

1659
01:19:55,889 --> 01:19:57,948
Yes, l'm number one

1660
01:19:57,991 --> 01:20:00,118
l'm second to none

1661
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,185
But what would l do
Were l number two?

1662
01:20:02,229 --> 01:20:04,390
For straight off you see
Good old number three

1663
01:20:04,431 --> 01:20:05,557
That's the conclusion

1664
01:20:05,599 --> 01:20:07,226
To the whole question!

1665
01:20:10,771 --> 01:20:13,239
By the way, where is
your bachelor flat exactly?

1666
01:20:13,273 --> 01:20:16,504
lt's very easy to find.

1667
01:20:16,543 --> 01:20:18,067
Make your way

1668
01:20:18,111 --> 01:20:19,772
To Quai Malaquais

1669
01:20:19,813 --> 01:20:21,371
Twenty-three

1670
01:20:21,415 --> 01:20:23,042
That's where you'll find me

1671
01:20:23,083 --> 01:20:24,675
ln the yard turn to your left

1672
01:20:24,718 --> 01:20:26,345
lt's the door without a cleft

1673
01:20:26,386 --> 01:20:29,753
You can't get it wrong
The framing shop is next along

1674
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:31,417
Make your way

1675
01:20:31,458 --> 01:20:32,948
To Quai Malaquais

1676
01:20:32,993 --> 01:20:34,585
There you meet

1677
01:20:34,628 --> 01:20:36,152
No one on the street

1678
01:20:36,196 --> 01:20:37,857
But for a scholar or two

1679
01:20:37,898 --> 01:20:39,490
Though they'll never bother you

1680
01:20:39,533 --> 01:20:40,966
They just care for books

1681
01:20:41,001 --> 01:20:42,764
And they will never
give you looks

1682
01:20:42,803 --> 01:20:45,829
Refusing second-best, l suggest

1683
01:20:45,872 --> 01:20:49,205
The perfect spot
for our little love-nest

1684
01:20:49,243 --> 01:20:50,733
Meet me tomorrow

1685
01:20:50,777 --> 01:20:52,472
And you'll know

1686
01:20:52,512 --> 01:20:54,275
Fiery passion nothing less

1687
01:20:54,314 --> 01:20:55,679
This is the address

1688
01:20:55,716 --> 01:20:57,047
Make your way

1689
01:20:57,084 --> 01:20:58,915
To Quai Malaquais

1695
01:21:08,996 --> 01:21:10,486

1696
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:12,122
The Quai Malaquais

1697
01:21:12,165 --> 01:21:13,723
Along that way

1698
01:21:13,767 --> 01:21:15,325
l shall never stray

1699
01:21:15,369 --> 01:21:18,566
You must be quite mad, dear boy
You can't treat me as your toy

1700
01:21:18,605 --> 01:21:19,902
And so you will stay

1701
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:22,738
Alone on your quai

1702
01:21:22,776 --> 01:21:26,041
l've just received the keys
lf you please

1703
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:29,048
For a flat where
l can take my ease

1704
01:21:29,082 --> 01:21:30,811
Much better than an hotel

1705
01:21:30,851 --> 01:21:32,478
lt'll be swell

1706
01:21:32,519 --> 01:21:35,818
Tell me now where it is found
And l shall call round

1707
01:21:35,856 --> 01:21:37,323
Make your way

1714
01:21:49,036 --> 01:21:50,663
All the way

1715

Here l am with my love-nest
What a pest

1723
01:22:06,253 --> 01:22:09,484
But l know a way
to put it to the test

1724
01:22:09,523 --> 01:22:12,754
Tomorrow for high tea
l'll be free

1725
01:22:12,793 --> 01:22:14,385
Really, it's a rendezvous

1726
01:22:14,428 --> 01:22:16,191
Where will l find you?

1727
01:22:16,229 --> 01:22:17,719

1734
01:22:29,576 --> 01:22:31,237
Ah l say

1735
01:22:31,278 --> 01:22:32,836
The Quai Malaquais

1736
01:22:32,879 --> 01:22:34,471
ln a trice

1737
01:22:34,514 --> 01:22:36,277
lt's like paradise

1738
01:22:36,316 --> 01:22:37,977
Charly, you're a charming boy

1739
01:22:38,018 --> 01:22:39,713
l shall meet you there with joy

1740
01:22:39,753 --> 01:22:41,152
Crossing the doormat

1741
01:22:41,188 --> 01:22:43,383
Of a young man's flat

1742
01:22:49,496 --> 01:22:52,124
l have just received
the papers from America

1743
01:22:52,165 --> 01:22:54,929
for our partnership contract.

1744
01:22:54,968 --> 01:22:56,401
Thank you.

1745
01:22:58,538 --> 01:23:00,369
You were once married?

1746
01:23:07,681 --> 01:23:09,342
To a Mademoiselle Poumaillac?

1747
01:23:15,455 --> 01:23:16,547
Fancy! How odd.

1748
01:23:16,590 --> 01:23:19,320
Perhaps she was related
to Gilberte.

1749
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:21,486
l don't know!

1750
01:23:21,528 --> 01:23:23,496
What about you, Gilberte?

1751
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:25,157
Perhaps you know
this Mademoiselle Poumaillac,

1752
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:26,825
who was married
to Monsieur Thomson?

1753
01:23:28,802 --> 01:23:30,099
Lord, no!

1754
01:23:31,371 --> 01:23:33,703
Why do you look so grim?

1755
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:35,799
What do you imagine?

1756
01:23:35,842 --> 01:23:38,777
There's more than one Poumaillac

1757
01:23:38,812 --> 01:23:42,179
There are many Poumaillacs
near Bergerac

1758
01:23:42,215 --> 01:23:44,809
Focus your attention

1759
01:23:44,851 --> 01:23:47,877
Oh, l feel quite sick

1760
01:23:47,921 --> 01:23:50,651
Yes, l see the situation

1761
01:23:50,690 --> 01:23:54,126
Could well be a trick

1762
01:23:54,161 --> 01:23:56,561
To calm down his emotion

1763
01:23:56,596 --> 01:23:59,588
Be diplomatic

1764
01:23:59,633 --> 01:24:01,567
We must try it all

1765
01:24:01,601 --> 01:24:03,694
But we must stand tall

1766
01:24:03,737 --> 01:24:08,265
Let's avoid every pitfall!

1767
01:24:08,308 --> 01:24:11,175
l'm a girl called Poumaillac

1768
01:24:11,211 --> 01:24:13,805
Here's another Poumaillac

1769
01:24:13,847 --> 01:24:20,252
Now there's a third Poumaillac

1770
01:24:20,287 --> 01:24:22,084
First there's number one

1771
01:24:22,122 --> 01:24:24,090
Who is next to none

1772
01:24:24,124 --> 01:24:25,853
Then there's number two
So what can you do?

1773
01:24:25,892 --> 01:24:27,757
The next has to be Number three

1774
01:24:27,794 --> 01:24:29,625
lt's accidental

1775
01:24:29,663 --> 01:24:31,597
But it's natural

1776
01:24:31,631 --> 01:24:33,428
And you have to say
There's no other way

1777
01:24:33,467 --> 01:24:35,833
Since it has to be
After two comes three!

1778
01:24:35,869 --> 01:24:37,302
But what's this to-do
She's uneasy too

1779
01:24:37,337 --> 01:24:39,430
l feel that my question
Must lack precision

1780
01:24:39,473 --> 01:24:41,168
-He looks right through you
-What is the reason

1781
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:42,937
-He seeks the reason
-For this combination

1782
01:24:42,976 --> 01:24:44,773
His suspicions accrue
l shudder anew

1783
01:24:44,811 --> 01:24:46,608
Does he have a clue
What he's going to do?

1784
01:24:46,646 --> 01:24:47,635
l am number one

1785
01:24:47,681 --> 01:24:49,546
But the boss never knew
Of the old issue

1786
01:24:49,583 --> 01:24:50,572
l'm in the stew

1787
01:24:50,617 --> 01:24:52,482
And the peace here to
ls losing its value

1788
01:24:52,519 --> 01:24:54,384
She bore my name too
After all it's true

1789
01:24:54,421 --> 01:24:56,116
-l am number one
-l see number one

1790
01:24:56,156 --> 01:24:58,124
And second to none

1791
01:24:58,158 --> 01:24:59,887
What is she to do
lf she's number two

1792
01:24:59,926 --> 01:25:01,860
He mustn't think she
ls now number three

1793
01:25:01,895 --> 01:25:04,762
lt's only natural, you see
After two comes three

1794
01:25:04,798 --> 01:25:06,595
And how true will it be?

1795
01:25:06,633 --> 01:25:10,000
After two comes three!

1796
01:25:16,977 --> 01:25:20,276
AND THlS ENDS ON MONDAY
AT 5:00 lN THE AFTERNOON.

1797
01:25:42,469 --> 01:25:43,993
Madame Janitor?

1798
01:25:44,037 --> 01:25:45,265
That's me!

1799
01:25:45,305 --> 01:25:47,432
-Ah! You're here for the flat!
-That's right!

1800
01:25:47,474 --> 01:25:49,066
Ah! l recall now.

1801
01:25:49,109 --> 01:25:51,577
You're the new tenant,
Monsieur Thomson.

1802
01:25:51,611 --> 01:25:53,806
-l am!
-And you've come to move in?

1803
01:25:53,847 --> 01:25:54,836
l've come!

1804
01:25:54,881 --> 01:25:55,870
Surely you don't want
to move in now?

1805
01:25:55,916 --> 01:25:57,850
-l do!
-That's not possible, sir.

1806
01:25:57,884 --> 01:25:59,818
Your lease doesn't begin
until tomorrow.

1807
01:25:59,853 --> 01:26:00,979
l'll pay!

1808
01:26:01,021 --> 01:26:03,990
The former tenant hasn't moved
his personal belongings out yet.

1809
01:26:04,024 --> 01:26:05,514
l'll pay.

1810
01:26:05,559 --> 01:26:07,424
You're buying the furnishings
and the carpets,

1811
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:09,223
but that doesn't
give you the right

1812
01:26:09,262 --> 01:26:11,594
to move in on the 31st
instead of the 1st.

1813
01:26:11,631 --> 01:26:13,189
l'll pay!

1814
01:26:13,233 --> 01:26:23,404
Ah! You mean you'll pay
compensation for the extra day.

1815
01:26:23,443 --> 01:26:24,910
l do mean.

1816
01:26:24,945 --> 01:26:27,743
You don't say a great deal, sir,
but you're easy to understand.

1817
01:26:27,781 --> 01:26:29,510
Let me see, eight thousand

1818
01:26:29,549 --> 01:26:31,540
for the carpets
and furnishings...

1819
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:36,450
five thousand for the lease,
paid in advance,

1820
01:26:36,489 --> 01:26:38,855
and one hundred and fifty
for the extra day.

1821
01:26:42,195 --> 01:26:43,628
l'll give it to you.

1822
01:26:43,663 --> 01:26:47,827
-Thirteen thousand two hundred.
-That's right.

1823
01:26:47,867 --> 01:26:49,767
l'll bring you
fifty francs change.

1824
01:26:49,803 --> 01:26:51,361
Keep it.

1825
01:26:51,404 --> 01:26:53,599
Thank you, sir.

1826
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:55,073
True, with the dollar
so strong,

1827
01:26:55,108 --> 01:26:56,973
that's barely ten francs
for you.

1828
01:26:57,010 --> 01:26:58,272
Thank you anyway.

1829
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:02,512
l'll give you
your receipt later.

1830
01:27:05,385 --> 01:27:08,616
l used to clean
for the previous tenant.

1831
01:27:08,655 --> 01:27:10,623
May l hope that Monsieur...

1832
01:27:10,657 --> 01:27:14,923
l'm asking you to go out
and stay out for a long time.

1833
01:27:14,961 --> 01:27:16,986
Very well, Monsieur.

1834
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:19,260
Oh, l forgot
to tell you my name.

1835
01:27:19,299 --> 01:27:20,698
l'm Madame Foin.

1836
01:27:20,734 --> 01:27:22,065
Widow Foin.

1837
01:27:22,102 --> 01:27:23,831
My husband,
the late Monsieur Foin...

1838
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:25,861
Get the hell...

1839
01:27:25,905 --> 01:27:28,169
-Get the hell...
-Hell out.

1840
01:27:28,208 --> 01:27:30,676
Thank you.
Yes, get the hell out.

1841
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:33,577
You speak French very well.

1842
01:27:33,613 --> 01:27:36,605
lt's a true pleasure
talking to you.

1843
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:39,710
All right, Monsieur, all right,
l'll see you later.

1844
01:28:58,932 --> 01:29:00,524
What a pleasant surprise!

1845
01:29:01,935 --> 01:29:03,960
Not very well,
but thank you for asking!

1846
01:29:09,075 --> 01:29:11,509
You seem rather upset.

1847
01:29:11,544 --> 01:29:14,274
-l couldn't sleep all night.
-Why?

1848
01:29:14,314 --> 01:29:16,373
l was mulling over
a lot of things.

1849
01:29:16,416 --> 01:29:21,080
That's bad. Sleep is sleep
and business is business.

1850
01:29:21,121 --> 01:29:24,386
l remembered the address
of the flat you'd found.

1851
01:29:25,959 --> 01:29:28,985
-l'll get straight to the point.
-That's always best.

1852
01:29:29,896 --> 01:29:33,388
Thomson, tell me the truth.
Were you married to Gilberte?

1853
01:29:43,543 --> 01:29:46,637
Since that scene yesterday,
a lot has come back to me.

1854
01:29:46,679 --> 01:29:48,408
Gilberte's awkwardness
when l found out

1855
01:29:48,448 --> 01:29:51,508
you had been married
to a Mademoiselle Poumaillac.

1856
01:29:51,551 --> 01:29:52,540
Then l remembered

1857
01:29:52,585 --> 01:29:54,883
she travelled to America
a few years ago.

1858
01:29:56,790 --> 01:29:59,588
This morning, a lawyer
told me that a wedding abroad

1859
01:29:59,626 --> 01:30:01,287
that isn't officialised
by the consul

1860
01:30:01,327 --> 01:30:03,557
doesn't count in the eyes
of French law.

1861
01:30:03,596 --> 01:30:07,032
And so, when l married her,
from a French legal viewpoint,

1862
01:30:07,066 --> 01:30:09,057
she was still
Mademoiselle Poumaillac.

1863
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:14,471
-Answer me, Thomson. ls it true?
-You seem very excited indeed.

1864
01:30:14,507 --> 01:30:18,034
You have to clear my doubts.
Answer me.

1865
01:30:18,711 --> 01:30:20,474
l have nothing to say.

1866
01:30:21,681 --> 01:30:23,012
That's tantamount
to a confession,

1867
01:30:23,049 --> 01:30:24,573
if you won't say anything.

1868
01:30:24,617 --> 01:30:26,482
That means you have
something to say.

1869
01:30:26,553 --> 01:30:28,020
Not at all. l speak good French.

1870
01:30:28,054 --> 01:30:30,784
ln America, it means
l'm not interested,

1871
01:30:30,824 --> 01:30:32,155
let's change the subject.

1872
01:30:32,225 --> 01:30:33,749
Try to understand.

1873
01:30:33,793 --> 01:30:35,988
Thomson, please,
tell me the truth.

1874
01:30:36,029 --> 01:30:39,897
The truth is that partners
must discuss business.

1875
01:30:40,767 --> 01:30:43,827
What do you think of
this morning's steel price?

1876
01:30:43,870 --> 01:30:46,498
Ah! You Americans
are quite extraordinary!

1877
01:30:47,607 --> 01:30:51,008
ln America, you think
you're all so smart

1878
01:30:51,044 --> 01:30:54,536
You believe no one
attains your state of art

1879
01:30:54,581 --> 01:30:56,014
You gaze in proud shock

1880
01:30:56,049 --> 01:30:58,017
At any tower block

1881
01:30:58,051 --> 01:31:01,578
But they don't have the power
Of our Eiffel Tower

1882
01:31:01,621 --> 01:31:05,113
You're the kings
and say so ad nauseam

1883
01:31:05,158 --> 01:31:08,616
The kings of iron
and the Grand Coulee Dam

1884
01:31:08,661 --> 01:31:10,424
The kings of combustion

1885
01:31:10,463 --> 01:31:12,158
The kings of emulsion

1886
01:31:12,198 --> 01:31:14,689
And the emperors
of Virginia ham

1887
01:31:15,235 --> 01:31:18,636
We have pigs here too,
cowboy, Old boy!

1888
01:31:18,671 --> 01:31:22,107
But they are far from coy,
Old boy!

1889
01:31:22,141 --> 01:31:23,802
When we have fun, we don't hide

1890
01:31:23,843 --> 01:31:25,572
And love here
is a source of pride

1891
01:31:25,612 --> 01:31:27,375
You drink vitriol over there

1892
01:31:27,413 --> 01:31:29,108
We drink wine without a care

1893
01:31:29,148 --> 01:31:32,481
For you, love's
a mere ploy, Old boy!

1894
01:31:32,518 --> 01:31:36,010
Over here, it's full of joy,
Old boy!

1895
01:31:36,055 --> 01:31:37,989
We do it best
from Paris to Hanoi

1896
01:31:38,024 --> 01:31:39,491
We're the best at that employ

1897
01:31:39,525 --> 01:31:43,256
There you'll never take
the lead, old boy!

1898
01:31:48,167 --> 01:31:52,331
l think you're very excited.

1899
01:31:52,372 --> 01:31:53,930
So l'll forgive you.

1900
01:31:53,973 --> 01:31:55,668
You still won't answer?

1901
01:31:56,910 --> 01:31:59,606
You can have a secret
that isn't yours alone.

1902
01:32:03,316 --> 01:32:06,114
Come back in an hour.
l'm sure to speak then.

1903
01:32:06,152 --> 01:32:07,517
All right.

1904
01:32:07,553 --> 01:32:10,647
Meanwhile, go for a run.

1905
01:32:10,690 --> 01:32:13,625
lt's very good to drain
the blood down to your feet.

1906
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:17,653
Yes, l feel...l need it...
my head is heavy.

1907
01:32:17,697 --> 01:32:20,666
His head is heavy because
he has something on his mind.

1908
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:22,658
See you in an hour.

1909
01:32:25,972 --> 01:32:28,031
-Madame Janitor!
-Here l am.

1910
01:32:28,074 --> 01:32:30,702
So quickly.
Were you behind the door?

1911
01:32:30,743 --> 01:32:33,871
l'm always ready to oblige.

1912
01:32:33,913 --> 01:32:38,976
Get me port, whisky,
soda and cakes.

1913
01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:43,220
l'll be in there working.
l'm expecting a lady

1914
01:32:43,256 --> 01:32:45,417
and l don't want
to be disturbed.

1915
01:32:45,458 --> 01:32:46,891
Very well, sir.

1916
01:33:05,478 --> 01:33:07,002
This is the place!

1917
01:33:08,881 --> 01:33:10,041
Most pleasant!

1918
01:33:11,384 --> 01:33:14,820
Monsieur Faradel.

1919
01:33:14,854 --> 01:33:16,879
Monsieur is here for his things?

1920
01:33:16,923 --> 01:33:17,912
Later.

1921
01:33:17,957 --> 01:33:19,288
There's plenty of time
until midday tomorrow.

1922
01:33:19,325 --> 01:33:24,194
lndeed, but the new tenant
has already brought his things.

1923
01:33:24,230 --> 01:33:28,394
Since he paid me to move in,
l thought he could.

1924
01:33:28,434 --> 01:33:31,801
Well, he's moved his things
in there, to the left-hand room.

1925
01:33:31,838 --> 01:33:34,272
The rest is free.

1926
01:33:34,307 --> 01:33:35,569
That's something!

1927
01:33:35,608 --> 01:33:37,098
Monsieur was here so rarely.

1928
01:33:37,143 --> 01:33:40,510
All right, Madame Foin,
now you mustn't let anyone in,

1929
01:33:40,546 --> 01:33:41,535
except a lady.

1930
01:33:42,281 --> 01:33:43,873
Who will ask for
Monsieur Charly here...

1931
01:33:43,916 --> 01:33:45,315
Monsieur isn't...?

1932
01:33:45,351 --> 01:33:47,046
No, l am.

1933
01:33:47,086 --> 01:33:49,077
Charly. Will you remember?

1934
01:33:49,756 --> 01:33:51,519
Charly.

1935
01:33:56,796 --> 01:33:59,731
He's a sweet boy. l love that.

1936
01:33:59,766 --> 01:34:00,858
There.

1937
01:34:01,868 --> 01:34:04,166
lt feels as if it's all for me.

1938
01:34:04,203 --> 01:34:07,229
You'll find the plates in the
small dresser with the glasses.

1939
01:34:07,273 --> 01:34:08,604
Perfect!

1940
01:34:08,641 --> 01:34:10,541
And is she pretty?

1941
01:34:10,576 --> 01:34:12,100
Delightful.

1942
01:34:12,145 --> 01:34:14,579
You lucky devil.
The bedroom's through here.

1943
01:34:14,614 --> 01:34:16,081
l'll find it, don't worry.

1944
01:34:16,115 --> 01:34:18,743
l won't keep you any longer.
And thank you.

1945
01:34:22,588 --> 01:34:25,386
At least this place will have
come in useful for once.

1946
01:34:42,942 --> 01:34:47,140
Let's decorate the chapel
and prepare the shrine.

1947
01:35:02,395 --> 01:35:05,193
Monsieur Charly will be
with you right away.

1948
01:35:05,231 --> 01:35:07,756
Such a nice young man.

1949
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:10,325
lt's easy to see how he could
drive a woman wild.

1950
01:35:11,537 --> 01:35:14,301
But, you know, you have nothing
to fear with me.

1951
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:17,707
lf ever your husband turns up,
l won't let him in.

1952
01:35:17,743 --> 01:35:18,835
My husband.

1953
01:35:25,051 --> 01:35:27,042
Talk of the devil.

1954
01:35:27,086 --> 01:35:29,680
There's nothing
you lovebirds need?

1955
01:35:29,722 --> 01:35:33,385
-No.
-All right. Have fun.

1956
01:35:33,426 --> 01:35:35,621
Oh, l love this.

1957
01:35:38,764 --> 01:35:39,992
Hello, Huguette!

1958
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:41,124
Hello, Charly.

1959
01:35:42,668 --> 01:35:45,034
What are you going
to think of me?

1960
01:35:45,071 --> 01:35:46,299
l'll tell you afterwards.

1961
01:35:47,273 --> 01:35:48,297
What?

1962
01:35:48,341 --> 01:35:49,865
You're shocked now!

1963
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:52,168
Believe me.

1964
01:35:52,211 --> 01:35:55,442
The most audacious people
are often the shyest.

1965
01:35:55,481 --> 01:35:58,109
-l feel a bit scared.
Really!

1966
01:35:58,151 --> 01:36:00,085
Do you promise to be reasonable?

1967
01:36:00,119 --> 01:36:03,111
How odd. You sound just like
a married woman.

1968
01:36:06,559 --> 01:36:09,551
So this is what
they call a bachelor flat?

1969
01:36:09,595 --> 01:36:10,892
That's right.

1970
01:36:12,899 --> 01:36:15,265
-A drop of port?
-l'd love some.

1971
01:36:24,610 --> 01:36:27,340
lt always begins
with a drop of port.

1972
01:36:38,491 --> 01:36:40,425
And then moves on to,
''Take off your hat.''

1973
01:36:41,093 --> 01:36:42,617
l can manage that.

1974
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:06,283
And then,
''Take off your dress.''

1975
01:37:06,319 --> 01:37:07,809
Oh no!

1976
01:37:07,853 --> 01:37:10,151
-Modest?
-Yes!

1977
01:37:10,189 --> 01:37:11,417
Forgive me, l'm rushing.

1978
01:37:11,457 --> 01:37:12,788
Oh! Charly.

1979
01:37:12,825 --> 01:37:14,952
l feel so awkward
because l love you.

1980
01:37:15,995 --> 01:37:18,156
l promise you, nothing
is going to happen.

1981
01:37:18,197 --> 01:37:21,030
l don't believe you.
l'd rather leave right now.

1982
01:37:24,337 --> 01:37:25,463
Farewell, then.

1983
01:37:29,408 --> 01:37:31,342
People kiss when
they say farewell.

1984
01:37:32,545 --> 01:37:33,569
Yes.

1985
01:37:40,019 --> 01:37:41,213
Huguette!

1986
01:37:41,254 --> 01:37:43,518
l'm leaving.

1987
01:37:43,556 --> 01:37:45,319
All right.
The door's through here.

1988
01:38:03,843 --> 01:38:06,277
When you're spying
through a hole

1989
01:38:06,312 --> 01:38:08,837
Through a hole

1990
01:38:08,881 --> 01:38:11,076
You lose all self-control

1991
01:38:11,117 --> 01:38:13,483
Through the keyhole of a door

1992
01:38:13,519 --> 01:38:15,680
When you're spying
through a hole

1993
01:38:15,721 --> 01:38:18,121
Through a hole

1994
01:38:18,157 --> 01:38:20,421
You learn and find out more

1995
01:38:20,459 --> 01:38:22,051
For through a hole

1996
01:38:22,962 --> 01:38:26,398
For through a hole,
things look so droll

1997
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:29,094
Well, for now,
they don't seem so hot

1998
01:38:29,135 --> 01:38:31,535
The poor lass has no experience

1999
01:38:31,570 --> 01:38:34,038
But that boy,
he knows what's what

2000
01:38:34,073 --> 01:38:36,667
He was showing her
his influence

2001
01:38:36,709 --> 01:38:39,075
lt's twenty years since
l saw it last, Lord

2002
01:38:39,111 --> 01:38:41,944
lt seemed so vast

2003
01:38:42,882 --> 01:38:45,146
When you're spying
through a hole

2004
01:38:45,184 --> 01:38:47,618
Through a hole

2005
01:38:47,653 --> 01:38:49,985
You learn and find out more

2006
01:38:50,022 --> 01:38:52,490
For through a hole,
things look so droll

2007
01:38:52,525 --> 01:38:54,993
When you're spying
through a hole

2008
01:38:55,027 --> 01:38:57,188
Through a hole

2009
01:38:57,229 --> 01:38:59,629
For through a hole,
things look so droll

2010
01:38:59,665 --> 01:39:01,997
Through a hole

2011
01:39:02,034 --> 01:39:04,366
You learn and find out more

2012
01:39:04,403 --> 01:39:05,392
End

2013
01:39:05,438 --> 01:39:07,906
Just next to the framing shop.

2014
01:39:10,042 --> 01:39:12,272
This is Monsieur Thomson's
residence?

2015
01:39:12,311 --> 01:39:13,437
Yes, Madame.

2016
01:39:13,479 --> 01:39:14,537
Mademoiselle.

2017
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:17,105
Oh! Sorry, l couldn't
have known.

2018
01:39:17,149 --> 01:39:18,514
ls Monsieur Thomson in?

2019
01:39:18,551 --> 01:39:21,952
l don't know. He said he was
only at home for a lady.

2020
01:39:21,987 --> 01:39:23,045
Well?

2021
01:39:23,089 --> 01:39:24,420
There are two of you!

2022
01:39:24,457 --> 01:39:25,924
lt's the same thing!

2023
01:39:25,958 --> 01:39:27,789
Well...

2024
01:39:31,931 --> 01:39:34,365
These Yankees
are an energetic lot.

2025
01:39:38,137 --> 01:39:43,234
l'm rather pleased to see
a bachelor flat, it's amusing.

2026
01:39:43,275 --> 01:39:45,539
Exciting, too.

2027
01:39:45,611 --> 01:39:47,841
The place is simply
fragrant with love.

2028
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:49,939
Really, Arlette, love is all
you seem to think about.

2029
01:39:49,982 --> 01:39:53,577
l can only find it here,
so let me hold onto it.

2030
01:39:55,321 --> 01:39:58,347
l'm not here for fun.
l asked her along

2031
01:39:58,391 --> 01:40:02,521
as soon as l got Thomson's note
fixing a rendezvous here.

2032
01:40:02,561 --> 01:40:04,324
Apparently, he has
something to tell me

2033
01:40:04,363 --> 01:40:06,991
that cannot be said
at my husband's home.

2034
01:40:08,701 --> 01:40:10,293
Do you have any idea
what he wants to tell me?

2035
01:40:10,336 --> 01:40:13,499
No...but in any case, he has
acted like a true gentleman.

2036
01:40:13,539 --> 01:40:14,836
He kept his word.

2037
01:40:14,874 --> 01:40:18,571
ln fact, he held it back,
which is even more difficult.

2038
01:40:18,611 --> 01:40:22,604
You must ask Thomson to return
to America immediately.

2039
01:40:22,648 --> 01:40:24,240
That's exactly why l'm here.

2040
01:40:26,886 --> 01:40:28,751
You have a chaperone?

2041
01:40:28,788 --> 01:40:31,018
A lady doesn't usually
call on a single gentleman

2042
01:40:31,056 --> 01:40:32,114
alone in France.

2043
01:40:32,158 --> 01:40:33,716
But it happens all the same.

2044
01:40:33,759 --> 01:40:36,523
l suppose you've nothing to say
to my sister that l can't hear.

2045
01:40:36,562 --> 01:40:38,359
On the contrary.

2046
01:40:38,397 --> 01:40:43,733
Ah, Madame Janitor
has bought the port.

2047
01:40:43,769 --> 01:40:46,329
A drop of port,
Mademoiselle Poumaillac?

2048
01:40:46,372 --> 01:40:48,067
l'd love some.

2049
01:40:48,107 --> 01:40:50,132
You may have some biscuits, too.

2050
01:40:51,544 --> 01:40:53,273
Gladly.

2051
01:41:00,686 --> 01:41:04,144
Well, my friend, l'm waiting to
hear this serious news of yours.

2052
01:41:08,794 --> 01:41:10,625
All right.

2053
01:41:10,663 --> 01:41:14,531
Your husband said something
that struck me yesterday.

2054
01:41:14,567 --> 01:41:19,561
He said, ''A woman
belongs forever

2055
01:41:19,605 --> 01:41:24,167
to the man
who first visited her.''

2056
01:41:24,977 --> 01:41:29,573
And, Gilberte,
your first visitor was me!

2057
01:41:29,615 --> 01:41:31,207
-Pardon?
-She's not a museum.

2058
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:33,946
He added, ''She is bound
to return to him,

2059
01:41:33,986 --> 01:41:35,112
even if life parts them.''

2060
01:41:35,154 --> 01:41:37,486
Now you're here, l'm glad
and we'll be very happy.

2061
01:41:37,523 --> 01:41:38,922
-You don't waste time!
-l'm American.

2062
01:41:38,958 --> 01:41:40,550
Surely you don't want me
to become your mistress?

2063
01:41:40,593 --> 01:41:41,582
Certainly not!

2064
01:41:41,627 --> 01:41:43,322
You divorce Valandray
and you marry me.

2065
01:41:43,362 --> 01:41:45,557
Valandray doesn't count,
he's dust, gone.

2066
01:41:45,598 --> 01:41:47,031
l'm going to tell him
everything.

2067
01:41:47,066 --> 01:41:48,055
No, you're not!

2068
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:50,398
l am, but l wanted
to warn you first.

2069
01:41:50,436 --> 01:41:51,733
So you're going to tell him,

2070
01:41:51,770 --> 01:41:53,465
''l was first,
hand back the goods.''

2071
01:41:53,506 --> 01:41:57,465
Exactly. Gilberte, you're
my fiancée, l'm so excited.

2072
01:41:57,510 --> 01:41:59,705
Sorry, but you're forgetting
l have a lover.

2073
01:41:59,745 --> 01:42:01,007
You'll need his permission.

2074
01:42:01,046 --> 01:42:03,879
Charly's not your lover.
He's just your sweetheart.

2075
01:42:03,916 --> 01:42:05,383
-You think so?
-l know so.

2076
01:42:05,417 --> 01:42:06,714
lf l'd thought that
he was your lover,

2077
01:42:06,752 --> 01:42:09,346
l wouldn't have told you
to become my wife again.

2078
01:42:09,388 --> 01:42:10,980
He's ready to be third,
but definitely not fourth.

2079
01:42:11,023 --> 01:42:12,456
No, no, no
and four times no!

2080
01:42:12,491 --> 01:42:14,254
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
four times yes.

2081
01:42:14,293 --> 01:42:16,022
This American's a real mule.

2082
01:42:16,061 --> 01:42:17,494
Monsieur.

2083
01:42:18,364 --> 01:42:22,061
No need, Madame Janitor,
name no names, l know.

2084
01:42:22,101 --> 01:42:26,197
Ladies, would you be kind enough
to step into the next room?

2085
01:42:26,238 --> 01:42:29,071
l still have a lot to tell you,
and l have someone to see first,

2086
01:42:29,108 --> 01:42:30,575
so l'll tell you after.

2087
01:42:30,609 --> 01:42:32,008
He wants to lock us away.

2088
01:42:32,044 --> 01:42:33,306
Just like Bluebeard.

2089
01:42:36,282 --> 01:42:38,079
lt's Monsieur Valandray,
isn't it?

2090
01:42:38,117 --> 01:42:40,779
No, Monsieur, l've just
brought you your receipt!

2091
01:42:47,593 --> 01:42:50,824
These Americans have
some very odd manners.

2092
01:42:58,871 --> 01:43:00,736
l forgot the bottle of port.
l need it now.

2093
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:03,139
The level's dropped.

2094
01:43:05,010 --> 01:43:06,204
Charly.

2095
01:43:06,245 --> 01:43:07,610
Gilberte!

2096
01:43:07,646 --> 01:43:09,910
You remembered our rendezvous
at Quai Malaquais?

2097
01:43:09,949 --> 01:43:11,849
ls this your bachelor flat?

2098
01:43:11,884 --> 01:43:13,681
Yes!

2099
01:43:13,719 --> 01:43:15,516
And you were expecting me?

2100
01:43:15,554 --> 01:43:17,078
Yes!

2101
01:43:17,122 --> 01:43:18,555
Really! How comical.

2102
01:43:18,591 --> 01:43:19,580
Why?

2103
01:43:19,625 --> 01:43:22,093
And very handy too!

2104
01:43:22,127 --> 01:43:23,355
l don't think so!

2105
01:43:25,064 --> 01:43:26,691
Charly, you're my saviour.

2106
01:43:26,732 --> 01:43:28,461
But the other one's
waiting next door.

2107
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:30,024
Come here.
Charly, my darling.

2108
01:43:30,069 --> 01:43:31,297
Yes.

2109
01:43:31,337 --> 01:43:32,895
Monsieur Thomson.

2110
01:43:32,938 --> 01:43:34,963
You refuse to believe
that Charly's my lover?

2111
01:43:36,008 --> 01:43:38,533
What's the matter?
l have to take you by force?

2112
01:43:38,577 --> 01:43:39,976
ls this the latest fashion?

2113
01:43:41,380 --> 01:43:43,041
Nowadays nothing does amaze

2114
01:43:43,082 --> 01:43:45,949
And nothing ever stops you

2115
01:43:45,985 --> 01:43:48,215
Feelings have no pride of place

2116
01:43:48,253 --> 01:43:50,414
Courting's not a thing to do

2117
01:43:50,456 --> 01:43:52,549
And love never leaves a trace

2118
01:43:53,993 --> 01:43:55,358
Good day; good night

2119
01:43:55,394 --> 01:43:58,454
After love,
they both take fright

2120
01:43:58,497 --> 01:44:00,021
Good night, good day

2121
01:44:00,065 --> 01:44:03,262
Feelings never get in the way

2122
01:44:03,302 --> 01:44:05,702
All those pretty words
Spoken by lovebirds

2123
01:44:05,738 --> 01:44:08,070
Are dead and gone

2124
01:44:08,107 --> 01:44:10,405
Seeing as bliss
Just a simple kiss

2125
01:44:10,442 --> 01:44:12,910
ls a bygone

2126
01:44:12,945 --> 01:44:14,674
Good day, good night

2127
01:44:14,713 --> 01:44:17,682
When it's over,
they're just polite

2128
01:44:17,716 --> 01:44:19,377
Good night, good day

2129
01:44:19,418 --> 01:44:22,080
Gallantry's gone the same way

2130
01:44:22,855 --> 01:44:24,015
You're so cold, Charly.

2131
01:44:24,056 --> 01:44:26,524
-Not at all.
-Do you still love me?

2132
01:44:26,558 --> 01:44:27,889
Yes, Gilberte, l love you!

2133
01:44:27,926 --> 01:44:30,019
-Say it louder.
-lt's just that...

2134
01:44:30,062 --> 01:44:31,996
Shout it out...like me!

2135
01:44:32,031 --> 01:44:33,225
ls he ever going to come back?

2136
01:44:33,265 --> 01:44:35,699
How am l going
to get out of this?

2137
01:44:35,734 --> 01:44:37,668
And take me in your arms.

2138
01:44:37,703 --> 01:44:42,333
Hurry! Charly, Charly!

2139
01:44:44,777 --> 01:44:46,108
Gilberte, here?

2140
01:44:47,413 --> 01:44:48,880
Georges, believe me.

2141
01:44:48,914 --> 01:44:49,903
Be silent!

2142
01:44:50,749 --> 01:44:52,080
Monsieur Valandray,
it's a mistake!

2143
01:44:56,121 --> 01:44:57,418
You, be gone.

2144
01:44:57,456 --> 01:44:59,287
Unless you want me
to grind your bones to dust.

2145
01:44:59,324 --> 01:45:00,313
Let me explain.

2146
01:45:00,359 --> 01:45:02,554
Not a word, go
and get dressed first.

2147
01:45:06,498 --> 01:45:08,398
Georges, it's not
what you think.

2148
01:45:08,434 --> 01:45:10,368
lt's not what l think?
That's brilliant.

2149
01:45:10,402 --> 01:45:12,233
l find you with some fellow
in his pyjamas

2150
01:45:12,271 --> 01:45:13,636
and it's not what l think!

2151
01:45:13,672 --> 01:45:15,037
Tell me what's going on.

2152
01:45:15,074 --> 01:45:18,134
-Just tell me!
-You're hurting me!

2153
01:45:19,244 --> 01:45:21,212
l love it when he's like this.

2154
01:45:24,083 --> 01:45:27,541
Good Heavens!
Georges, what are you doing?

2155
01:45:27,653 --> 01:45:29,052
l can see it all clearly now.

2156
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:30,988
Arlette, l see things
clearly at last.

2157
01:45:31,023 --> 01:45:35,016
l've just caught Gilberte here
with Charly in his pyjamas!

2158
01:45:35,060 --> 01:45:37,290
He really is her lover.

2159
01:45:37,329 --> 01:45:39,923
l don't need to hear Thomson.
l know where l stand.

2160
01:45:39,965 --> 01:45:41,933
l'm a cuckold,
because l'm not the first.

2161
01:45:41,967 --> 01:45:43,958
The Mademoiselle Poumaillac
that Thomson married

2162
01:45:44,002 --> 01:45:44,991
was Gilberte!

2163
01:45:45,037 --> 01:45:46,026
No, she wasn't!

2164
01:45:46,071 --> 01:45:48,596
That's not true...not at all.

2165
01:45:49,641 --> 01:45:52,974
The Mademoiselle Poumaillac
that Thomson married was me.

2166
01:45:53,011 --> 01:45:55,070
You would have said so earlier!

2167
01:45:55,114 --> 01:45:58,914
No, l couldn't.
lt was a big secret between us.

2168
01:45:58,951 --> 01:46:00,509
lsn't that right, Eric?

2169
01:46:00,552 --> 01:46:03,180
He made me suffer.
l wanted to forget him.

2170
01:46:03,222 --> 01:46:05,850
Come on, tell the truth, Sam.

2171
01:46:05,891 --> 01:46:07,882
You were the one who hurt me.

2172
01:46:10,162 --> 01:46:12,790
l adored the man,
but it's all over now.

2173
01:46:14,399 --> 01:46:16,026
My sister is wonderful.

2174
01:46:16,835 --> 01:46:19,099
Were you really married
to Mademoiselle Poumaillac?

2175
01:46:20,439 --> 01:46:22,771
Go on, answer, Sam.

2176
01:46:22,808 --> 01:46:24,867
l'll release you from
your vow of secrecy.

2177
01:46:30,682 --> 01:46:32,741
There's one simple way
to convince me.

2178
01:46:32,785 --> 01:46:35,879
Come along. Appease me.

2179
01:46:37,289 --> 01:46:39,348
Make up and kiss in front of me.

2180
01:46:40,459 --> 01:46:43,087
lf he made you suffer,
that means you still love him.

2181
01:46:43,128 --> 01:46:45,392
Come along.
A kiss of reconciliation.

2182
01:46:45,430 --> 01:46:47,125
Yes, Arlette, forgive him.

2183
01:46:47,166 --> 01:46:48,360
Do it for me.

2184
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,459
-You have to.
-Thomson, be a man.

2185
01:47:17,329 --> 01:47:18,921
Sam.

2186
01:47:18,964 --> 01:47:20,522
She kissed my lips!

2187
01:47:38,517 --> 01:47:40,781
Do you believe me now?

2188
01:47:40,819 --> 01:47:42,184
Yes...but Charly...

2189
01:47:42,221 --> 01:47:44,451
l'll explain,
but let's leave them.

2190
01:47:45,390 --> 01:47:46,880
We're in the way.

2191
01:47:46,925 --> 01:47:48,984
l merely came along
to accompany my sister.

2192
01:47:49,027 --> 01:47:50,289
Oh, Sam!

2193
01:47:51,663 --> 01:47:53,062
What have you done?

2194
01:47:53,999 --> 01:47:56,832
lt was you, l think.

2195
01:47:56,869 --> 01:48:00,327
Our lips met as they were trying
to avoid each other.

2196
01:48:00,372 --> 01:48:04,069
You're stirring the very
marrow of my bones.

2197
01:48:04,109 --> 01:48:08,045
l hadn't felt such an emotion
since my teacher.

2198
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:09,570
Sam.

2199
01:48:10,682 --> 01:48:14,118
At last l know
the sweet intoxication!

2200
01:48:14,152 --> 01:48:15,312
Of what?

2201
01:48:15,354 --> 01:48:19,017
The intoxication
of love's first kiss!

2202
01:48:20,092 --> 01:48:23,528
Yet l hardly dare to feel
that l care

2203
01:48:23,562 --> 01:48:24,654
Dare

2204
01:48:24,696 --> 01:48:28,029
lt overcomes me
when l feel such bliss!

2205
01:48:29,368 --> 01:48:32,769
Though my little heart
is full of fear

2206
01:48:32,804 --> 01:48:34,032
Dear

2207
01:48:34,072 --> 01:48:37,166
Yet it starts to fill with glee

2208
01:48:37,209 --> 01:48:38,676
''Ga-lee''?

2209
01:48:38,710 --> 01:48:42,874
l understand imperfectly

2210
01:48:42,915 --> 01:48:49,946
But l sense it so completely

2211
01:48:51,023 --> 01:48:53,548
Oh, Sam!

2212
01:48:56,094 --> 01:48:59,461
Do it once again, please

2213
01:48:59,498 --> 01:49:02,262
Oh, Sam!

2214
01:49:02,301 --> 01:49:04,895
You can be such a tease

2215
01:49:04,937 --> 01:49:07,235
l feel l've been swept away

2216
01:49:07,272 --> 01:49:09,638
lt's as if today's my birthday

2217
01:49:09,675 --> 01:49:14,339
My toes are curling
and my heart is pounding

2218
01:49:14,379 --> 01:49:18,076
Oh, Sam!

2219
01:49:18,116 --> 01:49:20,812
You're simply irresistible

2220
01:49:20,852 --> 01:49:23,685
Oh, Sam!

2221
01:49:23,722 --> 01:49:25,849
lt seems almost impossible!

2222
01:49:25,891 --> 01:49:28,189
The stars around me spangle

2223
01:49:28,226 --> 01:49:30,353
And my nerves are a-jangle

2224
01:49:30,395 --> 01:49:35,162
Cupid's aim is well
and truly infallible!

2225
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:38,533
You'll be the first
to have your way

2226
01:49:39,972 --> 01:49:44,068
That's something l have done

2227
01:49:44,109 --> 01:49:48,170
For l'm always number one

2228
01:49:51,249 --> 01:49:56,448
Oh, Sam!

2229
01:49:56,488 --> 01:49:59,719
You're simply irresistible

2230
01:49:59,758 --> 01:50:02,693
Oh, Sam!

2231
01:50:02,728 --> 01:50:05,526
lt seems almost impossible!

2232
01:50:05,564 --> 01:50:07,930
The stars around me spangle

2233
01:50:07,966 --> 01:50:10,059
And my nerves are a-jangle

2234
01:50:10,102 --> 01:50:14,937
Cupid's aim is well
and truly infallible!

2235
01:50:18,677 --> 01:50:21,168
l still can't understand
why Charly was in his pyjamas.

2236
01:50:21,213 --> 01:50:22,771
Well, neither can l.

2237
01:50:25,884 --> 01:50:28,079
-Oh, sorry!
-Drat.

2238
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:29,815
Ah well, too bad.

2239
01:50:31,656 --> 01:50:32,953
Everything's becoming clear now.

2240
01:50:33,825 --> 01:50:35,725
He was here for Huguette.

2241
01:50:40,565 --> 01:50:43,056
-My flat's quite crowded.
-But...

2242
01:50:43,101 --> 01:50:44,090
What do you mean, your flat?

2243
01:50:44,136 --> 01:50:46,036
Yes, this is my bachelor flat.

2244
01:50:46,071 --> 01:50:48,369
lt's mine, l paid for it!

2245
01:50:48,407 --> 01:50:50,307
And we've just celebrated
our engagement here!

2246
01:50:50,342 --> 01:50:52,276
-A little early!
-Hush!

2247
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:55,336
-And to consolidate a marriage--
-That was coming apart!

2248
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:57,814
And rebuilt one
that had been destroyed.

2249
01:50:59,084 --> 01:51:01,211
Lord! What have they
been up to in here?!

2250
01:51:01,253 --> 01:51:02,584
What a shock!

2251
01:51:02,621 --> 01:51:04,384
Drat! Here l go again.

2252
01:51:04,423 --> 01:51:07,221
All's well...

2253
01:51:07,259 --> 01:51:08,783
that end's well!

2254
01:51:10,262 --> 01:51:11,923
Will you say now
you're on your feet

2255
01:51:11,963 --> 01:51:14,397
Now, that was sweet!

2256
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:17,065
There's nothing more to add

2257
01:51:17,102 --> 01:51:19,297
Now that's not bad

2258
01:51:20,272 --> 01:51:22,740
Our songs were pleasant for you

2259
01:51:22,774 --> 01:51:25,368
And we're happy doing what we do

2260
01:51:25,410 --> 01:51:27,901
So we'll carry on alike

2261
01:51:27,946 --> 01:51:30,506
Now that we like

2262
01:51:30,549 --> 01:51:32,380
You're not yet on your feet

2263
01:51:32,417 --> 01:51:34,442
Now that's quite sweet

2264
01:51:35,620 --> 01:51:37,645
At the finale, you feel sad

2265
01:51:37,689 --> 01:51:39,714
Now that's not bad

2266
01:51:40,592 --> 01:51:43,083
lf you feel you do belong

2267
01:51:43,128 --> 01:51:45,562
Why don't you sing along?

2268
01:51:45,597 --> 01:51:48,088
We can all dive right back in

2269
01:51:48,133 --> 01:51:50,966
So let's begin

2270
01:51:51,736 --> 01:51:53,670
Will you say now you're
on your feet
