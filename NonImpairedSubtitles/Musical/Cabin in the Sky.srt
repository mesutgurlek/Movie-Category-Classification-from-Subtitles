1
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,137
Good evening, Lily. How are you?
Glad to see you.

2
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,805
- Hello, boys. How are you?
- Good evening, Reverend.

3
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,145
- Good evening. Glad to see you.
- How do you do?

4
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,617
- Good evening.
- I see you brought the twins too.

5
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,018
They had to come out.
I hope they stay awake.

6
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,954
- Hello there, Jean.
- How are you?

7
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:43,254
Come on in, now. Take your hats off, boys.
Take your hats off.

8
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:44,657
You see, Reverend?

9
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,426
It ain't every Wednesday night a scamp
like Little Joe comes back to the fold.

10
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:51,570
- Petunia dragged him in yet?
- He's coming of his own free will.

11
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:55,572
Well, I'll believe that
when I sees him stand up and confess.

12
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,671
Maybe he's let Petunia
down again, Reverend.

13
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,474
You better step over
to the house and make sure.

14
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,177
If he done backslid,
he wouldn't pay no mind to a deacon.

15
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,288
- You better go yourself.
- Perhaps you're right.

16
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:13,584
Petunia felt so sure of him this time.

17
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:38,406
- Now, we don't wanna be late, darling.
- Just a minute, Petunia.

18
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:42,077
Oh, the Lord won't mind if you
ain't wearing a necktie, Little Joe.

19
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:45,315
- I found the tie.
- Then what you worried about, honey?

20
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,621
Right now
I'm wrestling with the devil.

21
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,795
While I was looking for the necktie
in the bureau drawer...

22
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:57,870
...I also found two calamity cubes.
And I ain't thrown them away yet.

23
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,805
If I been redeemed, why ain't
I pitched them right into the stove?

24
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,968
The fact you told me you found them
shows you are trying to be good, Little Joe.

25
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,875
- Evening, Petunia.
- Evening, Reverend.

26
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,482
Bring them along
so Reverend Green can burn them up.

27
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,745
- Burn what up, Petunia?
- Oh, Little Joe found some dice...

28
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,288
...and he thinks the devil's
got a toehold on him again.

29
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,560
But don't worry,
we'll be to the meeting tonight.

30
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,220
Hurry up, Little Joe.
Reverend Green's here.

31
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,195
I'll be there in just a minute, honey.

32
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,632
I don't think any man could be very bad
with you to take care of him.

33
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,430
Oh, I reckon he knows I love him.

34
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,438
Yes, he knows I love him
better than anything in this world.

35
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,702
And he also knows now, when he gambles,
he ain't never gonna win.

36
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,402
How did you convince him of that?

37
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,277
I just showed him he can't win
when I ask the Lord to make him lose.

38
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,475
Is that why his luck's
always been so bad?

39
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,781
That's the only reason.
He just naturally got a talent for gambling.

40
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,414
Little Joe would've won every two bits
in this town if I hadn't told the Lord...

41
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:56,460
...I didn't want us
to make money that way.

42
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,790
You're a wonderful woman, Petunia.

43
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,365
Only last week he bought
an Irish Sweepstake ticket.

44
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:05,265
Got stuck up there in the mirror,
worshipping it every day.

45
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,972
"Guaranteed by two dream books
and a fortuneteller."

46
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:13,078
But I've been talking to the Lord about that.
It ain't gonna win either.

47
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,405
What made Little Joe realize
the power of your faith?

48
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,482
I'll tell you, Reverend, it's like this.

49
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,882
I've been praying every day
for Little Joe to get a job.

50
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,352
This morning he got one.

51
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:27,584
And that's finally convinced him
the Lord's in my corner.

52
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,660
- Good evening, Reverend.
- Evening, Joseph.

53
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,319
I hear you've started to work.

54
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,261
Yes, sir. From now on,
you can address me as "mine host."

55
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,493
- I've gone into the hotel business.
- That's fine.

56
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,037
He means he's got a job
down at that new hotel downtown.

57
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:44,665
Yes, sir. I'm operative in charge
of elevator number two.

58
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,972
That's gonna be nice for Little Joe.
That hotel's air-conditioned.

59
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,843
You know, honey,
when I get rich in the elevator game...

60
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,349
...maybe I'll air-condition our residence.

61
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,317
This one's already air-conditioned
with half the roof gone.

62
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,514
Well, it's about time
to start the services.

63
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,886
- You'll hurry along, won't you?
- We'll be there.

64
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,655
Reverend, when you call on
the sinners to confess...

65
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,163
...you'd better assign me
the rest of the evening.

66
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,164
Oh, you're not that bad, Joseph.

67
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:03,175
Now, those who wish to start out
on this pilgrim journey...

68
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:08,514
...we all will sing and join in singing
the song of invitation.

69
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:19,397
<i>'Tis the old ship of Zion</i>

70
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,280
come on, children. Come on, children.

71
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,915
Go ahead, now, Little Joe.

72
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,381
Go on, honey.

73
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,153
- Amen. Praise the Lord.
- Little Joe's joining up, Lily.

74
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,925
That's nice.

75
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,861
Wasn't a minute too soon, neither.

76
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,205
Don't whistle at me
through a church window, gentlemen.

77
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,875
- Can't you see I'm busy getting saved?
- Now, wait a minute.

78
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:20,056
Wait with that "getting saved" business
until you pays the money you owe.

79
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,558
- And you owes me more.
- You owe me more than that.

80
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,218
And you'll all be paid.

81
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,297
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Wait a minute.

82
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,990
You can pay us now.
Domino Johnson's back in town.

83
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:31,102
Domino Johnson?

84
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,205
- You in fast company.
- Yeah, he's over to Jim Henry's café now.

85
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,601
Loaded with money.

86
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,335
- Give him my congratulations.
- He's raring for action.

87
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,275
- He won't play with any of us.
- And he won't play with me.

88
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:43,347
I got an appointment with repentance.

89
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,279
Wait a minute. This is your chance.

90
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,887
Your last chance to make yourself
change before you gets repented.

91
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,647
Domino Johnson don't know you.

92
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,257
No, but you do.
And you know how unlucky I am.

93
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:57,395
- But this time, you'll play with our money.
- And with our dice.

94
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:01,194
And Georgia Brown
will be over there tonight too.

95
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,201
Look, please let me go.

96
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:07,635
- Be yourself. You coming along with us.
- I gave up gambling for Petunia's sake.

97
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,536
Didn't you say you wanted Petunia...

98
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,269
...to have those nice things
she didn't have before?

99
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,345
- Yes.
- All right, then, here's your chance.

100
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:17,004
Your last chance
to make it the easy way.

101
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,980
Why, man, you can clean up big tonight.

102
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,278
Yeah, but they're waiting
for me back in there.

103
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,853
Oh, you can get saved any day.

104
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,718
An opportunity like this only comes once.

105
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:29,361
Well, maybe I better cut down
on my gambling gradual.

106
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,428
- What can I do, Petunia?
- Come on.

107
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:39,368
Come on, children.
Come on to the Lord. Peace.

108
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,608
Lily.

109
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,211
- Little Joe ain't there.
- Ain't he?

110
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,577
- Well, he was here when the others got up.
- Maybe he's a little shy.

111
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,513
He must be waiting outside.

112
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:55,313
Come with me, Lily. I'm scared.

113
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,950
Little Joe?

114
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,858
Little Joe?

115
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:13,427
- He wouldn't go to...
- Well, you know that Little Joe.

116
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,074
No. He wouldn't do that.

117
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,903
He must have gone home.

118
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,544
Come on, Lily.

119
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,339
But, Petunia...

120
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,640
Little Joe? Little Joe?

121
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,840
Little Joe!

122
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,781
He ain't here.

123
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,985
Lily, something awful's happened
to Little Joe.

124
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,387
Petunia.

125
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,188
I got in a little trouble again, honey.

126
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,424
Little Joe!

127
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,040
I think he'll pull through.

128
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,545
We'll know in the morning.

129
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,411
- But can I go in, doctor?
- Yes, you may, Petunia.

130
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:36,247
But don't try to talk to him,
because he'll be out of his head.

131
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,254
Lord.

132
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,891
A fool.

133
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:51,594
Fool.

134
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,218
No, no. No.

135
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,017
Lord...

136
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,490
...please don't take Little Joe from me.

137
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,994
I know how sinful he's been lately,
but I love him.

138
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:22,464
And please forgive me
for loving him so much.

139
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:26,160
But Little Joe ain't wicked.
He's just weak.

140
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,273
And if he dies now,
the devil's going to get him sure.

141
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:33,502
And he don't deserve to be in a mess
like that. Little Joe ain't that bad.

142
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,738
So if you'll just let him
get well again...

143
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:40,818
...I promise you he'll mend his ways
and give you no more trouble.

144
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,446
Amen.

145
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,351
Those ain't my dice.

146
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,114
He's got a... He's got a gun.

147
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,918
Who's there?

148
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,360
Don't let him in here. I don't know you.

149
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,257
Get him out of here.

150
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,495
Little Joe...

151
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:02,293
...rise up from that bed
and report for duty.

152
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:05,292
Report? Report where?

153
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,530
Now, where do you suppose
you'd be reporting?

154
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,606
A shiftless no-account like you is.

155
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,869
- Get up.
- I can't get up from this bed.

156
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:17,311
- I'm a very sick man.
- Little Joe, you ain't sick no more.

157
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,576
You are dead.

158
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:32,662
What are you doing here, Lucius?

159
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,904
What's that you called me?

160
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,600
Ain't you my old friend Lucius Ferry?

161
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,541
Lucius Fe...

162
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:54,642
You are speaking to Lucifer Jr.

163
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,755
Joe, the asbestos chariot is awaiting.

164
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:01,154
- Come on, grab him and let's get going.
- No, no!

165
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:04,553
- Come on.
- I ain't dead. I don't feel dead.

166
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,888
If you ain't...

167
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,557
...who is that laying in that bed?

168
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,851
That's me.

169
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,416
That's right.
Then who do you think you are?

170
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,217
I don't know.
I ain't never been twins before.

171
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,950
And you still ain't twins.

172
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,722
You's the spirit of that body, Little Joe.
And you're the one we've come for.

173
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,525
Petunia.
Petunia, don't let them get me.

174
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,931
Petunia can't hear you now.
Boy, you is gone.

175
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:48,232
Here I is, Petunia.
Don't look at him. Look at me.

176
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,602
How you expect Petunia
to see your spirit?

177
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,904
To her, you just a hunk of thin air.

178
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,641
- Little Joe, your hands is cold.
- Course they is. I'm dead.

179
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,615
Oh, Lord, something's wrong
down here. I feel it.

180
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:05,188
- You ain't gonna let him die, are you?
- That's right, Petunia, pray.

181
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,382
Pray harder. You's a faithful servant.

182
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,357
If Little Joe dies,
I ain't got nothing left to live for.

183
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,225
Don't let up, Petunia.
Keep plugging. Keep plugging for me.

184
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,924
I know you hear me.
If you save him on earth for me...

185
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,626
...I’m gonna save him
for you up in heaven.

186
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,098
That is terrific praying.

187
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,374
Come on, grab this rascal.
Let's get him out of here.

188
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,704
- No!
- Get that leg. Take him on out of there.

189
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:31,475
Get the legs, number four. Pull him around.
Don't let him switch up on you like that!

190
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,430
What's going on here?

191
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,157
I'm in an awful mess.

192
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,892
Reverend?

193
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,437
Who gave you orders
to incinerate this man?

194
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,806
We got our orders direct from
the hot seat, from the big boss hisself.

195
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,140
And you better keep out of this.

196
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,955
- You're Lucifer's boy, aren't you?
- I am.

197
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,388
Look like old Lucifer
been jumping the gun again.

198
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:21,022
Oh, no, he haven't either. Little Joe here's
been 1-A on our list for a long time.

199
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,361
You've had lots of souls
that you didn't get.

200
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:27,631
Yes, I knows that, but Little Joe never did
do any repenting until after he was dead.

201
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,900
That don't count and you knows it.
What are you doing down here?

202
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,600
Answer me that.

203
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,473
I'll tell you.

204
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,706
We received a powerful prayer
from Petunia here.

205
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,942
It was the most powerful
piece of praying...

206
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:44,317
...we's heard up there in a long time.
- I was afraid of that.

207
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,323
Now, if you coal-heavers don't lay off
while we investigate...

208
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,518
...you gonna have
some explaining to do.

209
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,994
You don't have to check up on me,
Reverend. You know I been reforming.

210
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,759
I know very little about you, Joseph.

211
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:58,368
Ain't you the reverend in our church?

212
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,095
I am a soldier of the Lord.

213
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,901
And nothing must be done
till I look into this case.

214
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,673
Don't let him bluff you.

215
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,938
We've been wanting to tangle
with them birds for a long time.

216
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,382
Now wait a minute here.

217
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,451
What's the reason we can't talk
this thing over sensible-like?

218
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,555
Now, what does your boss want
with a no-account like Little Joe?

219
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,749
- You knows by rights he belongs to us.
- No, I don't, general.

220
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,053
And I thank you
for letting me come with you.

221
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,196
Wait a minute, Joseph. Not so fast.

222
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,333
I was told to investigate,
not to bring you up there.

223
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,434
But you won't be taking no chances, sir.

224
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:34,163
I can be a very handy man up there.
I can run the elevator...

225
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,332
...going up, tune harps
and mind cherubs, or anything.

226
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,344
First thing you know, you'll have a bunch
of dice-shooting angels on your hands.

227
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,311
Don't listen to him. Listen to Petunia.

228
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,917
- She knows how hard I been...
- Quiet.

229
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,150
I am listening to her.

230
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,380
Lord, if you just let him
get well again...

231
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,492
...I promise you I'll get him back
in the fold.

232
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,887
- But I promise you...
- Hold on here.

233
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,758
How come Petunia there knows
what we're talking about?

234
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,399
I don't know.

235
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,593
Petunia's always been
in pretty close touch with the Lord.

236
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,294
But this is a new one on me.

237
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,803
Looks like the Lord
is letting her in on something.

238
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,772
That's strictly against the rules
for human beings down here.

239
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,806
This is a problem.

240
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,742
Sergeant Fleetfoot.

241
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,245
- Yes, sir.
- Better zoom up...

242
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,611
...and get a firsthand judgment
from the Lord.

243
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,253
Yes, sir. I won't be a minute, general.

244
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:25,948
- No stunting, now.
- Oh, no, sir.

245
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:31,725
Now, what for you wanna go
through all this rigmarole?

246
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,832
You just messing up the bookkeeping.
I tell you what I'll do.

247
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,231
- I'll shoot you for him.
- Okay, you're faded.

248
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,702
Oh, no, Little Joe. Not you, him.

249
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,637
- You're a lot of trouble to us, Little Joe.
- Trouble?

250
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:49,042
Just wait until your boss starts checking up
on his carryings-on with Georgia Brown.

251
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:52,149
Maybe you didn't know
she's my pappy's favorite child.

252
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,842
We know all about
that Georgia Brown affair.

253
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,853
- It's a long black mark against you.
- Little Joe just weak.

254
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,583
He was trying to get away
from that old Georgia Brown...

255
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,522
...but she just overpowered him.

256
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,889
This coaching from the sideline
has gotta stop.

257
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,826
That's dirty pool and you knows it.

258
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,763
Petunia's right, sir.
I was trying to get rid of that woman.

259
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,425
And I was making headway too.

260
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,299
Why, only last week
I says to her... I says:

261
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,407
"Georgia, we can't go on like this.

262
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,839
Why, it's grieving
poor Petunia something fierce."

263
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,502
Oh, Little Joe, careful, now.

264
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,910
Well, that's what I thought anyhow.

265
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,983
Don't forget, we can read
your thoughts up there too.

266
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,915
Well, that's what I ought to thought.

267
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:36,054
Little Joe, we's gonna have
Georgia Brown with us before long.

268
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,196
You are, sure enough?

269
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:43,158
Makes no neverminds to me.
No, sir.

270
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,996
That's right where she belongs.

271
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,367
Little Joe, that thought that weaseled
through your soul just now...

272
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,271
...convinces me that you're not fit
to associate with our folks up there.

273
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,173
It's just too dangerous.

274
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,075
Oh, my.

275
00:21:56,248 --> 00:22:00,480
I'm just about the most miserablest person
what ever died.

276
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:06,221
Boy, you ain't half as miserable
as you gonna be.

277
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:10,455
Petunia!

278
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,629
Petunia, help!

279
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,423
Little Joe, you ain't breathing.

280
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,467
- Lily, Lily!
- I heard you, Petunia.

281
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:22,539
Oh, Lord, you ain't gonna let him die.
You ain't forsaken me, have you?

282
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,406
Lily! Little Joe ain't breathing.

283
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:37,953
- I'm afraid it's all over now, Petunia.
- Don't say that.

284
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:41,752
The Lord's not taken Little Joe from me
so I won't see him again.

285
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,122
You better come get some rest.

286
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:48,062
If it wasn't for the best, the Lord
never would've let this happen to you.

287
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,723
No.

288
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:53,136
Lord, I've heard your voice.

289
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:57,105
And I'm hanging on to my faith in you,
no matter what happens.

290
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,335
- But don't take Little Joe from me.
- Okay. It's all right.

291
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,275
Don't take him.

292
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:10,753
You certainly have been
a heartache to her, Little Joe.

293
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,982
General, I'm a rat.

294
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,561
Sergeant Fleetfoot,
you made good time.

295
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,754
The flying was good, general.

296
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:23,094
- Tail wind all the way.
- What's the Lord's verdict?

297
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:26,930
The Lord said Little Joe
ain't no fit company for our folks.

298
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,936
Oh, me. The jig's up.

299
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:31,541
But you ain't heard
the whole thing out yet.

300
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,769
- There's a proviso.
- A what?

301
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:38,079
Quote, "on account
of Petunia praying so hard...

302
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,311
...the Lord done give him leave to stay
on this earth for six months more.

303
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,921
If he whitewash his soul
in that time...

304
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,958
...he makes the grade with heaven."
- And what if he don't?

305
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:53,120
"Lucifer Sr.
Gets permanent control," unquote.

306
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,596
- You know Little Joe's never gonna change.
- Oh, yes, I can.

307
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,566
I done changed already. Yes, sir.

308
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:02,263
I'll spread the light
and preach the word. Hallelujah.

309
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,103
Wait a minute, Little Joe.
There's one catch in this.

310
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,006
You're not gonna remember anything...

311
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,147
...when you wake up
and become alive again.

312
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,407
- I ain't?
- No, you're not.

313
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:15,484
You see, your human mind
is gonna be blank about all this.

314
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:18,350
Your human mind is over there
in your human body.

315
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,548
How am I gonna reform
if I don't remember...

316
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:24,354
...what a mess I was in when I was dead?
- It's gonna be like this, Little Joe.

317
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,726
We're gonna be around telling
your conscience the right thing to do.

318
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,868
Of course, you won't see us,
but we'll be there.

319
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:34,836
And is he gonna be around telling
my conscience the wrong thing to do?

320
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,373
Oh, I'll be there, all right.
You can depend on that.

321
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,374
That's bad.

322
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,282
Well, I'll be seeing you, Little Joe.

323
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,417
So long.

324
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,757
We'll give him a fight.

325
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:59,521
Go back, Little Joe, to your human body.

326
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,793
I hope that in this second life...

327
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:04,902
...you fight a good fight.

328
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,334
I'll be in there pitching, general.

329
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,701
Good luck, Little Joe.

330
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,809
- Petunia! Petunia!
- Great day in the morning.

331
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:21,885
Here I am, darling.

332
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,216
- Little Joe.
- Petunia.

333
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:27,654
- You're alive.
- Oh, Lord. This is sure enough a miracle.

334
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:30,056
- I'll get the doctor.
- We don't need the doctor.

335
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,890
Tell the reverend, tell everybody.
Little Joe's all right.

336
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:37,660
Lord, I thank you. And right now
I'm so happy, I can't talk.

337
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:40,031
But I know you understand.

338
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,469
- Petunia.
- Don't move.

339
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,438
Be quiet.

340
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,352
Good morning, Petunia.

341
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,987
You're looking
mighty happy this morning.

342
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:57,362
I was till this minute. What you
and Dude coming here for, Jim Henry?

343
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,567
We is devotees of good singing.

344
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,036
But you ain't here
because you're music lovers.

345
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,607
We was just wondering
how Little Joe's getting along.

346
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:08,576
Oh, Little Joe just getting along fine.
Doc Jones says he'll be up and about soon.

347
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,944
I'm seeing to it he don't get mixed up
with you and your crowd again.

348
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:17,180
That suits us. But there's a little business
matter we'd like to take up with him.

349
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:20,756
We didn't want to bother Little Joe
till he got better...

350
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,450
...but it's been over a month now.

351
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:26,563
Very thoughtful of you.
I suppose this business matter is money?

352
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:30,792
Yes. As a matter of fact,
I has the loU right here for...

353
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:34,200
- Four dollars. And you?
- Six.

354
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,468
Well, Jim Henry...

355
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,974
...you being such a bigtime sport...

356
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:42,545
...you wouldn't take advantage
of somebody like me...

357
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,682
...who don't know
nothing about gambling?

358
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:48,580
- No, no.
- Well, I tell you what.

359
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:54,157
Suppose we shoot your dice for,
I think the phrase is, "double or nothing"...

360
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,428
...for that money Little Joe owes you.
- That sounds fair enough.

361
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:01,990
And to show you that we mean you good,
we gonna let you roll them.

362
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,533
You mean I can throw them
down there on the ground?

363
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:07,671
- Yeah, sort of out of the way.
- I see.

364
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,900
- Now, look, I can practice a little bit?
- Oh, that's perfectly all right.

365
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,137
- A one and another one.
- That's snake eyes.

366
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,375
- Is that bad?
- It ain't good.

367
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:25,822
- A two and a one. What's that?
- That's bad news again.

368
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,091
Look here. Ain't there
no good news on these things?

369
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,990
Oh, yes, the number's there
if you is lucky.

370
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:36,190
Something tells me I ain't lucky.
Let me see you roll them, Jim Henry.

371
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:39,598
Anything to pleasure a lady.
You got your money, ain't you?

372
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:42,035
- Why, of course.
- Well, all you have to do...

373
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,675
...is to lay your money on the ground.

374
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:51,644
Well, coming at you.
Your announcer is Jim Henry.

375
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,943
Big natural, dice.

376
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,612
- What's the matter?
- I done changed my mind.

377
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:59,723
- I think I'll roll them myself.
- But you passed the dice to me.

378
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:02,155
I know, and now I'm passing
the dice back to me.

379
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,659
- And these the same dice I had before?
- Oh, yes.

380
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:07,024
- All right...
- You don't wanna tire yourself out.

381
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,929
Oh, ladies first, Jim Henry.
Never forget your manners.

382
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,662
This time it's for keeps.

383
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,238
Seven.

384
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:20,468
Ain't that funny how my luck
done changed all of a sudden?

385
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,179
I guess I'm just dumb and lucky.

386
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,645
That takes care of you business,
little Jim Henry.

387
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:27,717
Now, put your money down here
so I can take charge of you, son.

388
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,854
I... I... I think I'm gonna let mine ride.

389
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:33,184
You must have thought that
I didn't hear myself speak.

390
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,258
- Read it.
- Eleven.

391
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:40,864
Correct. Switch dice on me, will you?

392
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:44,729
That's the stuff you been pulling off
on Little Joe. Get out of here, you two.

393
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:48,964
If I catch you here again,
I'll set the law on you.

394
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,841
Oh, Lord.

395
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,171
Please forgive me for backsliding.

396
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,472
But sometimes
when you fight the devil...

397
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,913
...you got to jab him
with his own pitchfork.

398
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,487
- You know something, Petunia?
- What?

399
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,151
When I gets recovered...

400
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,889
...I ain't gonna let you break your back
working for me.

401
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:17,034
Oh, I don't mind, sugar,
long as it's you I'm working for.

402
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,635
Well, I'm gonna be good to you
from now on.

403
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:22,295
I'm gonna buy you
electric washing machine.

404
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:24,839
You ain't gonna do
nobody's scrubbing but your own.

405
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:28,240
Sure enough? Little Joe, you just about
to kill me with kindness.

406
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:32,543
Oh, Petunia, you know I ain't never
done nothing for you before.

407
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:37,120
Why you've worked your fingers to the bone
to see that I had a pleasant recuperation.

408
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:40,416
You snatched me from the clutches
of all those hoodlums I ran with.

409
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:42,684
I tell you, I feel like a new man.

410
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,522
And that's just the way
you gonna continue to be.

411
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,358
How do you know that?

412
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:50,899
Oh, the Lord gives me proof in here.

413
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,696
How do you mean?

414
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,930
Little Joe, when you're good...

415
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,598
...something in here starts singing.

416
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:02,007
And the Lord seems to say,
"Petunia...

417
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,081
...all my angels
are playing beautiful music...

418
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:09,413
...because they feel so happy for you.
Can you hear it down there?"

419
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:11,282
And I listen.

420
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:15,183
And sure enough I hear it as plain
as if I was up in heaven myself...

421
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,454
...and they were teaching me
their prettiest tunes.

422
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:22,793
Then I realize that's the Lord's way
of telling me to be happy.

423
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:26,596
Petunia, how many tunes
do you suppose the angels know?

424
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:31,299
Well, nobody can say that down here.
But if you just keep on being good...

425
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,910
...me and you gonna hear
them together someday.

426
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:36,945
You mean way up there in the deep blue?

427
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:41,312
- You suppose they'll let us be together?
- Of course they will.

428
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,954
If we do the job right here,
they won't let us down...

429
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,750
...when we're finally ready to go home.

430
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:49,888
Do you reckon the angels know
any of the songs you sing?

431
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,790
They sure do.

432
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:55,729
Oh, I suppose they do sing awful pretty.

433
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,425
But I'd rather hear you any day.

434
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,120
Boogie!

435
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,491
Oh, boogie, boy.

436
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:58,226
Hey! Stop that noise!
What's going on around here?

437
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:00,393
Is this what you calls
office efficiency?

438
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:04,234
- You imps is supposed to be working.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

439
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:07,571
Well, boys, we's on the spot.

440
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:11,476
Pappy said we gotta get Little Joe, or I ain't
gonna be the head man around here.

441
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:15,611
You know that means there's gonna be
a shakeup in the Idea Department too.

442
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:19,051
Why is Lucifer so doggone bent
on getting that Little Joe?

443
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,384
Pappy's gotta make a test case
out of this one.

444
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,153
He won't let the Lord get away
with breaking the rules...

445
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,319
...by giving Little Joe another chance.

446
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:29,028
If the Lord gets pigheaded
about this case...

447
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,100
...I don't know how we gonna win out.

448
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,401
We never has yet.

449
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:38,631
Boys, we's got to pull something big.
We's got to get a colossal idea.

450
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,902
Like the time we got
King Pharaoh of Egypt...

451
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,808
...to force the children of Israel
to make bricks without straw.

452
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:46,506
- Do y'all remember that one?
- Do I remember that one?

453
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:50,176
- Wasn't I the one who thunk it up?
- That's right, you was.

454
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:53,949
- Wasn't the Lord burned up about that one?
- He was that.

455
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:57,561
I didn't do so bad myself.
I was the one that thought up...

456
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,891
...flies.
- And you ain't had an idea like that since.

457
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,862
You's going stale. All of you.

458
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:06,093
Ideas like them only come
once in a million years, Junior.

459
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,067
One of you better get an idea quick.

460
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,537
Or you all gonna be out there
in your old jobs...

461
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,074
...heaving coal in the boiler room.

462
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,303
It's gonna be kind of tough
on you boys...

463
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:19,176
...after this nice, cool,
air-conditioned office.

464
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,547
Now, that's gratitude for you.
That's gratitude for you.

465
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,019
After all the wickedness we done
promoted for the big boss...

466
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:30,149
...ever since Eve got Adam
to nibble on that apple.

467
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:32,622
There's a great idea.

468
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:36,130
Who thought that one up?
Oh, I know you did. Don't tell me.

469
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,531
- Man, that's how I started my career.
- Yeah.

470
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:42,934
And here we are watching it finish.

471
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:48,341
If I could just get that
psalm-singing Petunia out of the way.

472
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:51,970
Doggone it, she's in my horns
at every turn.

473
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,446
Hey, chief.

474
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,745
How about setting Petunia up
in a love nest with a rich racketeer...

475
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:59,412
...and then getting the joint raided?

476
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,550
- That is the most awful idea!
- I'm sorry.

477
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,889
The whole trouble is, I's stuck
with a bunch of B idea men.

478
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:08,293
All the A boys is over there in Europe.

479
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,865
Say...

480
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,797
...how about?

481
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,002
- No.
- No?

482
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,978
Let me see, now.

483
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:26,483
I've got it!
I've got something terrifical.

484
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,915
Listen to this. Why can't we flood
Little Joe with money?

485
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:31,349
Barrels of money.

486
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:35,322
Make him rich and watch him
come down here quicker than that.

487
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:39,425
- I don't know.
- It's awful good.

488
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:43,158
Think of all the success we've had
with rich souls up there.

489
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,734
Give a man money, watch him act funny.

490
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,928
It ain't bad, Junior.

491
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,699
Now, how you figure
you're gonna make Little Joe so rich?

492
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:55,107
- How about a sweepstake ticket?
- Well, ain't that a little corny?

493
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:57,839
Oh, no, man.

494
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:02,145
Ain't Little Joe always buying chances
on some kind of ticket that don't pay off?

495
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,346
Yeah. I just remembered,
he's got one right now.

496
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,253
Well, all right.

497
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:12,452
If Lucifer can fix it
for that ticket to pay off...

498
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:16,464
...then we'll call in a girl
that we know is gonna help us.

499
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:21,264
- Miss Georgia Brown.
- The same.

500
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:25,204
We as good as got Little Joe
on the broiler right now.

501
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:29,972
- Sounds better than the apple gag to me.
- Oh, I guarantees it personally.

502
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:33,139
Boys, maybe we's in again.

503
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:36,115
Wait a minute. I'm gonna pull
this one on the big boss.

504
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,950
- Get me Lucifer Sr.
- Just a minute.

505
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:41,751
I just got an idea.

506
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:44,360
How about taking Little Joe
and making him rich?

507
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:47,093
Boy, where have you been?

508
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:48,965
Hello.

509
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:52,602
Hello, Pappy.

510
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,102
I think we just cracked
that Little Joe case.

511
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:58,605
Oh, yes, sir. I just thought up
an idea that's a natural.

512
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:01,301
Came to me just like that.

513
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:05,044
Can you fix it so Little Joe can
cash in big on his sweepstake ticket?

514
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:06,978
You can?

515
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,446
Then he's just as good
as in the bag already.

516
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:13,914
That's right. We make him rich...

517
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,185
...and with the cooperation
of one of your favorite daughters...

518
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:20,023
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, that's the one.

519
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:24,861
Then all we does is just sit back
and watches the fun.

520
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,768
Okay, then, Pappy.

521
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,634
You just tend to that ticket
and leave the rest to me.

522
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:33,777
Oh, yes, sir. Thank you, Pappy.

523
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,502
How's Mammy?

524
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,815
So you still in the doghouse, huh?

525
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:43,483
Well, so long, Pappy.

526
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:46,712
Boys, he's crazy about it.

527
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,917
Now, all we's got to do
is to sell Georgia Brown the idea.

528
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:54,128
She'll know what to do
with that Little Joe.

529
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:14,915
My, my.
You sure are a pretty thing, Georgia.

530
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:18,282
Yes, sir, you certainly
are a sight for the eyes.

531
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:21,891
Now, just look at yourself.
There's no doubts about it.

532
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:24,721
You just about
the prettiest girl in town.

533
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:29,426
That's enough. Get going.

534
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:33,734
Oh, it's such a beautiful day.

535
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:37,840
Mostly anything could happen to a girl
on a pretty day like this.

536
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:41,535
Wearing her best dress,
her best perfume.

537
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:44,180
Your best perfume.

538
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:50,453
I wonder what Little Joe's
doing right now.

539
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:55,320
He never could resist you.
And you kind of like him too, don't you?

540
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:59,153
Yes, sir. That little man
certainly had something.

541
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:02,765
Wouldn't do no harm to sort of...

542
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:06,528
...mosey over and see
how he's doing, huh?

543
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:09,795
Go on.

544
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:16,243
Just mosey.

545
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,890
Hey, hey! Hey, be careful.

546
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,960
Where you want this put, Mr. Jackson?

547
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,996
Just take it around
to the rear entrance to my residence.

548
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:37,929
I guess he means the back porch.

549
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:50,709
- Petunia?
- Right here, honey.

550
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:54,347
- What you doing?
- Trying to keep your lunch warm.

551
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:57,885
- You're a little late today.
- I had to stop off at a couple of places.

552
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:00,888
Joe, you're up to something.
What you hiding behind your back?

553
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:02,787
A little gift for you.

554
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,760
Oh, Little Joe, you shouldn't.
And ain't they pretty.

555
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,693
Not pretty enough for you, Petunia.

556
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:11,767
There ain't no flowers pretty enough
for my Petunia's birthday.

557
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:16,497
Birthday. Oh, Joe, this is the first time
you've remembered my birthday in years.

558
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:20,336
Oh, it ain't nothing. I'm aiming
to remember all of them from now on.

559
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:23,412
- What's on the ice?
- Oh, a nice cold pitcher of lemonade.

560
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,878
Oh, yes.

561
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:29,014
Just what the doctor ordered.

562
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,517
Look at you.

563
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:35,215
Standing all covered with God's good dirt
and all the devilishness sweated out you.

564
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:37,451
My, but you a handsome sight.

565
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,358
Look at them muscles.
Ain't they killing?

566
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:44,092
- About to pop out of my sleeve.
- I bet you the strongest man on that job.

567
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:46,964
Oh, I toss them sacks around
like they was full of nothing.

568
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:51,198
Why, the boss say if I don't slow down he's
gonna have to unemploy a couple of men.

569
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,503
Joe, just what on earth are you doing?

570
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:58,375
Now comes the grand surprise.
Come on.

571
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:00,883
Come on, come on.

572
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:07,022
Have some refreshments
on the house, boys.

573
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:09,091
What'll you have for a chaser?

574
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:10,556
How you like it?

575
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:13,696
Now all we need is some electricity
so we can run it.

576
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:18,195
Come on.

577
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:33,980
Oh, honey.

578
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:35,812
Not on your birthday.

579
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:38,887
There ain't nobody got no right
being happy as I am.

580
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:41,889
Well, come on. Smile, then.

581
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:44,823
Come on. That's it.

582
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:47,122
Now, you wanna do something
to make me happy?

583
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:48,992
Sing us a little song.

584
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:52,624
- Oh, come on, Miss Jackson.
- Sure.

585
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:56,329
- The one you sang the first time we...
- Joe.

586
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:59,066
Oh, you know the one I mean.

587
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,747
Petunia!

588
00:52:30,677 --> 00:52:32,406
Six o'clock already.

589
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:34,809
How come you so spry, Little Joe?

590
00:52:34,981 --> 00:52:38,542
Oh, you can't wear out a man filled with
the spirit of the Lord.

591
00:52:51,764 --> 00:52:53,959
Which one of y'all
is Little Joe Jackson?

592
00:52:54,134 --> 00:52:56,329
- What do you want with him?
- Is you him?

593
00:52:56,503 --> 00:52:59,199
Maybe I am. That all depends
on who you are.

594
00:52:59,372 --> 00:53:01,863
Well, I got a cablegram for him.

595
00:53:03,877 --> 00:53:06,072
What's a cablegram?

596
00:53:06,479 --> 00:53:08,640
- Something good?
- Well, sometimes it's good...

597
00:53:08,815 --> 00:53:10,077
...and sometimes it's bad.

598
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:12,377
Well, how about this one?
Is it good or bad?

599
00:53:12,552 --> 00:53:14,076
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

600
00:53:14,254 --> 00:53:17,690
- Well, in that case, I don't want none.
- Oh, so you is Little Joe Jackson.

601
00:53:17,857 --> 00:53:20,758
- You got to receive it.
- What do you mean, I got to receive it?

602
00:53:20,927 --> 00:53:23,589
- This is a free country, ain't it?
- This is special for you.

603
00:53:23,763 --> 00:53:25,697
There's your name right on it.
See there?

604
00:53:25,865 --> 00:53:27,730
Looks like just a ordinary letter to me.

605
00:53:27,901 --> 00:53:30,392
It is, except that it come
from under the ocean.

606
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:33,004
Just sign right there.

607
00:53:33,406 --> 00:53:34,896
Is this gonna cost me something?

608
00:53:35,074 --> 00:53:37,565
We usually gets a little
something for our services.

609
00:53:37,744 --> 00:53:39,302
Of course, that's up to you.

610
00:53:39,479 --> 00:53:41,379
Well, that's settled.

611
00:53:45,852 --> 00:53:47,649
What you doing? Voting?

612
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:50,345
That's my signature
when my secretary ain't around.

613
00:53:50,523 --> 00:53:52,855
I'm a very busy man.
Clear out of here, will you?

614
00:53:53,026 --> 00:53:55,017
Maybe I'd better read it to you, huh?

615
00:53:55,195 --> 00:53:57,060
You trying to tell me I can't read?

616
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:59,994
Now, go on, beat it,
while I look over my correspondence.

617
00:54:00,166 --> 00:54:03,658
Okay. I was just trying to be helpful.

618
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:16,908
What in the world
is all this about anyhow?

619
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:19,313
So that's it.

620
00:54:21,821 --> 00:54:25,257
That's what you've been cooking up
in your fire, you smoke-eating mole.

621
00:54:25,425 --> 00:54:27,655
I told Pappy this was gonna
take you by surprise.

622
00:54:27,827 --> 00:54:30,591
What do you mean by fixing it
for him to win the sweepstake?

623
00:54:30,763 --> 00:54:34,722
- You're not gonna get away with this.
- This'll buy him a ticket to the boiler room.

624
00:54:34,901 --> 00:54:37,961
This is the dirtiest double-cross
since Lucifer's been in business.

625
00:54:38,137 --> 00:54:42,039
Why, thank you, general.
You're rather flattering today.

626
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:44,768
Can't make heads or tails
out of this thing.

627
00:54:44,944 --> 00:54:47,003
- Must be an ad, I guess.
- Joseph.

628
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:49,239
That paper might lead you
into temptation.

629
00:54:49,415 --> 00:54:51,679
- Throw it away.
- No, no, don't you do it.

630
00:54:51,851 --> 00:54:53,819
You wouldn't want Petunia
to know about it.

631
00:54:53,987 --> 00:54:56,547
Don't believe him.
Petunia would love to know about it.

632
00:54:56,723 --> 00:54:58,350
- Throw it away!
- Hang on to it!

633
00:54:58,524 --> 00:55:00,492
Maybe you'd better step in, Lord.

634
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,094
- Still here, Joe?
- I was just going.

635
00:55:03,263 --> 00:55:06,130
- Going to the picture show?
- No. Me and Petunia's going...

636
00:55:06,299 --> 00:55:08,096
...to a prayer meeting.
- Okay, deacon.

637
00:55:08,268 --> 00:55:11,101
- I'll walk down with you.
- Okay.

638
00:55:14,607 --> 00:55:18,065
Good evening, Junior.

639
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:26,847
- Does Little Joe Jackson work here?
- You just missed him, lady.

640
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,920
He went home.

641
00:55:52,945 --> 00:55:55,106
Oh, my!

642
00:55:56,215 --> 00:55:59,742
I guess we'll use the frying pan after all.

643
00:56:03,756 --> 00:56:05,747
Petunia!

644
00:56:07,493 --> 00:56:10,326
Honey! Petunia!

645
00:56:10,496 --> 00:56:12,691
Oh, Petunia?

646
00:56:12,865 --> 00:56:15,129
Where are you, Petunia?

647
00:56:16,502 --> 00:56:19,164
Oh, Lily? Where'd Petunia go?

648
00:56:19,339 --> 00:56:22,604
She said she's going to the store
to get you some clothes.

649
00:56:22,775 --> 00:56:24,538
Oh, yeah.

650
00:56:40,293 --> 00:56:43,057
Doggone, I ought to fix that roof.

651
00:56:58,544 --> 00:57:00,978
That would be a fine thing to do, Little Joe.

652
00:57:01,147 --> 00:57:03,308
The main idea is to keep busy, you know.

653
00:57:09,355 --> 00:57:10,982
Oh, I'm too tired.

654
00:57:11,157 --> 00:57:13,523
I'll fix it in the morning.

655
00:57:50,863 --> 00:57:54,890
General, you ain't seen nothing yet.

656
00:57:57,003 --> 00:57:59,301
Just take a look over yonder.

657
00:58:24,831 --> 00:58:26,958
Hello, Little Joe.

658
00:58:30,436 --> 00:58:33,371
This is bad business.

659
00:58:35,174 --> 00:58:38,075
Georgia Brown.
Wha..? What are you doing here?

660
00:58:38,244 --> 00:58:41,270
I just wanted to say hello
and see how you been.

661
00:58:41,447 --> 00:58:43,438
Ain't no harm in that.

662
00:58:43,616 --> 00:58:45,208
Is there?

663
00:58:45,384 --> 00:58:50,253
Well, there ain't no harm
in passing the time of day. I guess.

664
00:58:50,423 --> 00:58:52,948
It's nice to know
you're getting well again.

665
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:55,958
I hope you ain't forgot me.

666
00:58:56,128 --> 00:58:58,892
Oh, I ain't forgot you.

667
00:58:59,832 --> 00:59:04,064
Then maybe you'll be coming round
to Jim Henry's place to see me.

668
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:07,501
- I tell you, Georgia, it's like this.
- Yeah?

669
00:59:07,673 --> 00:59:10,369
It's like this.

670
00:59:11,611 --> 00:59:15,445
It seems the last time I was there,
I got into a little bit of trouble.

671
00:59:15,615 --> 00:59:19,278
Oh, that. Oh, the guy
that caused all that trouble...

672
00:59:19,452 --> 00:59:23,388
...that Domino Johnson, he's in jail now.

673
00:59:23,556 --> 00:59:25,683
I know, but that ain't it.

674
00:59:25,858 --> 00:59:27,519
Well, what is it, then?

675
00:59:27,693 --> 00:59:29,957
Look at me, Little Joe.

676
00:59:30,129 --> 00:59:32,893
Is you happy without seeing me?

677
00:59:33,065 --> 00:59:35,431
- Well, the truth is...
- of course you're happy.

678
00:59:35,601 --> 00:59:39,037
Tell her to get away from here
before you spoil all your chances.

679
00:59:39,205 --> 00:59:43,539
Tell the truth, I has been trying
my best not to think of you lately.

680
00:59:43,709 --> 00:59:46,269
You has, sugar?

681
00:59:47,146 --> 00:59:51,082
Why, you lying rascal. You know
you never could get her out of your mind.

682
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:52,842
Go ahead and tell her that.

683
00:59:53,019 --> 00:59:57,217
Of course, I ain't saying
I altogether forgot you.

684
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:59,358
You ain't easy to erase from the mind...

685
00:59:59,525 --> 01:00:02,653
...once a man gets
to know you good-like.

686
01:00:02,828 --> 01:00:06,457
Why does you want
to forget me, sugar?

687
01:00:06,632 --> 01:00:10,966
Well, it seems there was
a lot of reasons why...

688
01:00:11,137 --> 01:00:15,506
...but for the life of me, I can't seem
to think of one of them now.

689
01:00:15,675 --> 01:00:18,200
Of course, if you don't care
about me no more.

690
01:00:18,377 --> 01:00:20,174
Georgia, don't talk like that.

691
01:00:20,346 --> 01:00:23,474
Why, you know I'd never do anything
to hurt your feelings.

692
01:00:23,649 --> 01:00:27,483
Oh, honey.

693
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:41,364
- And there goes his passport to heaven.
- Get her out of here.

694
01:00:41,534 --> 01:00:45,800
Oh, this is the best fight
we've won in a long time.

695
01:00:46,806 --> 01:00:48,831
Go ahead, Little Joe.
Kick over the traces.

696
01:00:49,008 --> 01:00:51,203
Now, stop that, Little Joe.

697
01:00:51,377 --> 01:00:53,777
Think of the consequences.

698
01:00:53,946 --> 01:00:57,006
Little Joe, cut that out!

699
01:02:55,334 --> 01:02:58,167
Georgia, this has got to stop.

700
01:02:59,171 --> 01:03:02,368
Little Joe, you ain't fooling me none
with that there religion stuff.

701
01:03:02,541 --> 01:03:03,906
I know you better than that.

702
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:07,045
You're just playing hard to get.
And I know why too.

703
01:03:07,213 --> 01:03:10,341
- What are you talking about?
- This. This is what I'm talking about.

704
01:03:10,516 --> 01:03:14,179
- You dropped it down at the mill.
- Oh, that's just a little old ad.

705
01:03:14,353 --> 01:03:19,256
An ad? Did you read it?
You gonna be filthy with money.

706
01:03:19,592 --> 01:03:22,254
- How filthy?
- Why, you big ignoramus...

707
01:03:22,428 --> 01:03:26,159
...this here piece of paper says you've
drawn the horse in the Irish Sweepstake.

708
01:03:26,332 --> 01:03:29,460
- Say that again, slower.
- Listen to this:

709
01:03:29,635 --> 01:03:33,503
"Mr. Joe Jackson.
Dear sir, we are happy to learn...

710
01:03:33,672 --> 01:03:37,164
...that you drew the horse Runaway
in the forthcoming Irish Sweepstakes...

711
01:03:37,343 --> 01:03:39,436
...and that he is the favorite to win.

712
01:03:39,612 --> 01:03:44,447
We hereby offer you a sum equal
to $50,000 for your interest in..."

713
01:03:44,617 --> 01:03:46,812
I'm gonna be rich!

714
01:03:47,353 --> 01:03:49,548
I don't know whether
I'm dreaming or not.

715
01:03:49,722 --> 01:03:52,020
I'm gonna be rich.

716
01:03:53,626 --> 01:03:55,526
This must be the payoff.

717
01:03:55,694 --> 01:03:58,561
This must be my reward
for being a good husband.

718
01:03:58,731 --> 01:04:04,067
Petunia was right. The Lord
is wonderful! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

719
01:04:04,236 --> 01:04:07,000
No, no! That's not the way
it's supposed to work out.

720
01:04:07,173 --> 01:04:10,074
Wait till Petunia hears this. Hallelujah!

721
01:04:10,242 --> 01:04:11,971
Not quite the way you planned it, eh?

722
01:04:13,145 --> 01:04:15,613
What are you gonna do
with all that money, Little Joe?

723
01:04:15,781 --> 01:04:18,443
Buy Petunia all the things
she's never had.

724
01:04:18,617 --> 01:04:20,983
Wait till she gets here.

725
01:04:21,387 --> 01:04:25,289
But, Georgia, I wouldn't have known
about this if it hadn't been for you.

726
01:04:25,457 --> 01:04:27,584
I'm gonna show you how grateful I am.

727
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,752
I'm gonna buy you
a diamond bracelet and a fur coat...

728
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:33,228
...maybe even
your own nightclub too.

729
01:04:33,399 --> 01:04:35,890
- It's all right, Petunia.
- Oh, Little Joe...

730
01:04:36,068 --> 01:04:39,094
...I love you so much more now
than I ever did.

731
01:04:39,271 --> 01:04:42,069
This is the most wonderful thing
that's ever happened to me.

732
01:04:42,241 --> 01:04:43,503
Little Joe!

733
01:04:44,109 --> 01:04:45,736
Petunia.

734
01:04:46,712 --> 01:04:49,180
You double-crossing snake.

735
01:04:49,348 --> 01:04:52,579
Sneaking that woman in my house
the minute my back is turned.

736
01:04:52,751 --> 01:04:56,084
- But, Petunia, you're all wrong. Listen...
- Listen for what?

737
01:04:56,255 --> 01:04:58,246
Ain't I seen and heard enough already?

738
01:04:58,424 --> 01:05:00,949
You gonna buy her a bracelet
with the money you earned.

739
01:05:01,126 --> 01:05:03,788
What's the matter? You gone
out your mind? You gone crazy?

740
01:05:03,963 --> 01:05:05,191
Yes, I'm going crazy.

741
01:05:05,364 --> 01:05:08,561
And if I stand here looking at you
another minute, I'll kill you both!

742
01:05:08,734 --> 01:05:10,463
Listen, let me explain something.

743
01:05:10,636 --> 01:05:13,264
Joe, for the last time,
get out of my sight!

744
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,235
Oh, no.

745
01:05:32,258 --> 01:05:37,525
Petunia.
You didn't even give him a chance.

746
01:05:45,638 --> 01:05:47,265
Lord...

747
01:05:47,439 --> 01:05:49,669
...why you let me love him so much...

748
01:05:49,842 --> 01:05:52,675
...so he can hurt me so bad?

749
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:55,274
Why?

750
01:12:07,953 --> 01:12:09,181
Hey!

751
01:12:09,354 --> 01:12:11,720
Look who's present.

752
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:14,854
Knock me down
if it ain't Domino Johnson.

753
01:12:15,027 --> 01:12:16,426
- When'd you get out?
- Tonight.

754
01:12:16,595 --> 01:12:19,155
- Only had six months' lease on that cell.
- Welcome home.

755
01:12:19,331 --> 01:12:20,923
- Glad to be with you.
- Hey, big boy.

756
01:12:21,099 --> 01:12:22,760
- Hi, y'all, babes.
- Domino!

757
01:12:22,934 --> 01:12:25,425
- Easy, honey, easy.
- Hello, Domino.

758
01:12:25,604 --> 01:12:27,265
- Hello there, Jim Henry.
- Hi, Domino.

759
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:29,566
- Hi, Dude!
- Nobody I'd rather see than you.

760
01:12:29,741 --> 01:12:32,073
- Come on, have a little drink.
- Thanks. My, my.

761
01:12:32,244 --> 01:12:33,939
Things sure look prosperous.

762
01:12:34,112 --> 01:12:36,672
Last time, one of the
characters tried to operate...

763
01:12:36,848 --> 01:12:39,112
...with a pair
of imperfect dice, remember?

764
01:12:39,284 --> 01:12:41,514
I don't think Little Joe
knew they were loaded.

765
01:12:41,687 --> 01:12:43,780
- Well, he found out.
- What'll it be, Domino?

766
01:12:43,955 --> 01:12:46,685
- A little rye.
- It's on the house. A little rye.

767
01:12:46,858 --> 01:12:50,385
Duke Ellington's band.
Where'd all this prosperity come from?

768
01:12:50,562 --> 01:12:53,588
As a matter of fact, most of the
bankroll came from Little Joe.

769
01:12:53,765 --> 01:12:56,461
Yeah, he's just loaded down with money.

770
01:12:56,635 --> 01:12:58,967
He give me this 20
just for shining his shoes.

771
01:12:59,137 --> 01:13:00,661
You better keep him away from me.

772
01:13:00,839 --> 01:13:03,967
- You don't intend to start trouble with him.
- That's up to him.

773
01:13:04,142 --> 01:13:07,270
As a matter of fact,
I'm here entirely for social purposes.

774
01:13:07,446 --> 01:13:10,244
Suppose you tell Miss Georgia Brown
that her old friend...

775
01:13:10,415 --> 01:13:12,315
...Domino Johnson is back in circulation.

776
01:13:12,484 --> 01:13:15,920
- I'm not sure she'll be in this evening.
- Still working here, ain't she?

777
01:13:16,088 --> 01:13:17,988
Yeah, when she feels like it.

778
01:13:18,156 --> 01:13:21,057
If she gets in at all, it won't be till late.

779
01:13:21,226 --> 01:13:23,888
Then I'll stick around.
Got a game going upstairs?

780
01:13:24,062 --> 01:13:28,089
- Yeah, a little stud poker.
- Well, I'll stroll up and take a few hands.

781
01:13:28,266 --> 01:13:30,791
But don't forget to let me know
when Georgia gets here.

782
01:13:30,969 --> 01:13:33,164
We certainly won't.

783
01:13:34,272 --> 01:13:36,365
If he sees her with Little Joe...

784
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:41,376
This time I ain't gonna use the door,
I'm going out the window.

785
01:13:41,646 --> 01:13:43,477
- Well, look who's here!
- Domino!

786
01:13:43,648 --> 01:13:44,945
Welcome home, baby.

787
01:13:45,117 --> 01:13:49,451
- You gonna do any shooting tonight?
- Yes, sugar, but only with dice.

788
01:13:49,621 --> 01:13:53,489
- My, you do look sharp tonight.
- Yeah?

789
01:16:56,241 --> 01:16:59,438
Quiet. Which one of you kids
is gonna mind my tires tonight?

790
01:16:59,611 --> 01:17:01,238
I am!

791
01:17:01,413 --> 01:17:04,940
Well, I guess I better let you all do it.
Here's a little change for you.

792
01:17:05,116 --> 01:17:07,277
Catch it. Come on.

793
01:17:10,722 --> 01:17:13,088
You better pick us up
about 4 in the morning.

794
01:17:13,258 --> 01:17:16,750
Very good, sir, and hot dog.

795
01:17:18,363 --> 01:17:20,354
May I, Madame?

796
01:17:34,779 --> 01:17:37,714
Great day!

797
01:17:37,882 --> 01:17:40,749
Joe, that's the
bestest-looking raiment...

798
01:17:40,919 --> 01:17:44,047
...since they first invented clothes.

799
01:17:44,856 --> 01:17:48,724
My, my, look at that jewelry.

800
01:17:49,995 --> 01:17:51,257
It ain't nothing at all.

801
01:17:51,429 --> 01:17:54,262
Wait till you see what
I spring on you next Saturday.

802
01:17:55,166 --> 01:17:58,431
Now, if you'll all just step over
to the bar and be my guests.

803
01:18:02,273 --> 01:18:04,764
Georgia, that dress
will be ahead of fashion...

804
01:18:04,943 --> 01:18:07,503
...a hundred years from today.
- Yeah, yeah.

805
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:09,408
You ain't seen nothing yet.

806
01:18:09,581 --> 01:18:12,812
The accessories are even cuter.

807
01:18:17,222 --> 01:18:19,383
Georgia. Georgia.

808
01:18:19,557 --> 01:18:21,957
- Remember, you're a lady now.
- I know it, sugar.

809
01:18:22,127 --> 01:18:25,358
I'm just trying to impress them
with that fact.

810
01:18:33,104 --> 01:18:34,503
Hey.

811
01:18:34,673 --> 01:18:37,574
You wanna see something swell?
Lookie there. Genuine silk.

812
01:18:37,742 --> 01:18:39,505
I got a dozen of them.

813
01:18:40,045 --> 01:18:41,444
Dude!

814
01:18:41,613 --> 01:18:44,138
Tell the band to play Georgia's number.

815
01:20:16,107 --> 01:20:17,938
Domino!

816
01:20:18,576 --> 01:20:21,841
Hello, Little Joe.
How you doing these days?

817
01:20:22,013 --> 01:20:25,312
I'm still alive and kicking,
but that ain't no fault of yours.

818
01:20:25,483 --> 01:20:28,145
Still cheating the boys
with those one-way dice of yours?

819
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:30,412
Cut that stuff out.

820
01:20:30,588 --> 01:20:34,319
Georgia, what are you doing
hanging around with small fry like that?

821
01:20:34,492 --> 01:20:36,926
Better than hanging around
with a gambler like you.

822
01:20:37,095 --> 01:20:40,064
- I won't take that from you.
- Look out, he'll go after you again.

823
01:20:40,231 --> 01:20:42,028
That's all right. Let him.

824
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,260
- Only this time, I ain't running, see?
- Come on, boys. Break it up.

825
01:20:45,436 --> 01:20:48,405
This is a social gathering.
You trying to get back in that jail?

826
01:20:48,573 --> 01:20:50,200
Good evening, riffraff.

827
01:20:50,775 --> 01:20:53,437
Hello, Jim Henry.
Thought I'd just drop round...

828
01:20:53,611 --> 01:20:56,239
...and give your joint the once-over.

829
01:20:57,348 --> 01:20:59,839
Why, Petunia.

830
01:21:00,018 --> 01:21:02,486
- Is this really you?
- But not the same me...

831
01:21:02,654 --> 01:21:06,283
...you used to break her back
busting suds over a tub for you.

832
01:21:06,457 --> 01:21:07,890
Why, you...

833
01:21:08,059 --> 01:21:09,526
You're beautiful, Petunia.

834
01:21:09,694 --> 01:21:13,130
Save that sugarcoated talk
for your girlfriend.

835
01:21:13,364 --> 01:21:14,661
Where'd you get the clothes?

836
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:17,859
Don't you worry about that.
The main point is you paying for them.

837
01:21:18,036 --> 01:21:21,563
Of course. Of course I'll pay for them.
I didn't realize...

838
01:21:21,739 --> 01:21:25,004
And that ain't all I'm collecting
before I'm through.

839
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:27,235
Don't talk like that, Petunia.

840
01:21:27,412 --> 01:21:28,970
You know I still love you.

841
01:21:29,147 --> 01:21:31,172
Now, you just be a little more careful...

842
01:21:31,349 --> 01:21:34,318
...what you say to your wife
in front of me.

843
01:21:34,819 --> 01:21:36,309
Georgia, you keep out of this.

844
01:21:36,487 --> 01:21:38,978
- I'm speaking my mind.
- And I ain't heard a sound.

845
01:21:39,157 --> 01:21:41,955
Little Joe, are you so dumb
you can't see what she's after?

846
01:21:42,126 --> 01:21:47,257
We're both after the same thing, but
I'm still the wife and got the inside track.

847
01:21:48,733 --> 01:21:51,668
Petunia, don't talk like that.
Why, I was coming around to see...

848
01:21:51,836 --> 01:21:54,771
Don't strain yourself.
I'm sending my lawyer round to see you...

849
01:21:54,939 --> 01:21:56,372
...and he'd better find you in.

850
01:21:56,541 --> 01:21:58,099
- What for?
- Money. What you think?

851
01:21:58,276 --> 01:22:02,474
And if you ain't saved my half,
brother, start sprouting wings.

852
01:22:03,815 --> 01:22:06,716
- What's wings?
- That's one way of getting out of jail.

853
01:22:06,885 --> 01:22:09,012
I know all about
that sweepstake money...

854
01:22:09,187 --> 01:22:12,315
...and I'm solid collecting my half,
cash on the line.

855
01:22:12,490 --> 01:22:15,015
Well, I don't know
if I got that much left, Petunia.

856
01:22:15,193 --> 01:22:19,630
No? Then you're just
in the correct suit to be laid out in.

857
01:22:23,334 --> 01:22:26,531
I'll shoot you for a drink, Jim Henry,
with your own dice again.

858
01:22:26,704 --> 01:22:29,798
No. Might as well give you the drink
and pass up the formalities.

859
01:22:29,974 --> 01:22:31,942
What'll it be, Miss Jackson?

860
01:22:33,177 --> 01:22:37,580
- You may give me a double King Kong.
- Boy. Coming up.

861
01:22:39,617 --> 01:22:41,278
Petunia.

862
01:22:42,053 --> 01:22:46,888
Pardon me, but ain't you the gentleman
that used my ex-husband...

863
01:22:47,058 --> 01:22:49,151
...for target practice six months ago?

864
01:22:49,327 --> 01:22:51,056
Yes, I had that pleasure.

865
01:22:51,229 --> 01:22:54,130
Then permit me to buy you a drink
for that good deed.

866
01:22:54,299 --> 01:22:56,893
Oh, no, ma'am. The drinks is on me.

867
01:22:57,068 --> 01:23:00,003
You know, Mr. Johnson,
I usually don't drink with strangers...

868
01:23:00,171 --> 01:23:04,835
...but we have so much in common.
We both dislike the same people.

869
01:23:09,681 --> 01:23:13,310
Brown! Ain't it about time
for you to get into that cooch dance?

870
01:23:13,484 --> 01:23:16,783
Ladies. Georgia, remember,
when you in the presence of a lady...

871
01:23:16,955 --> 01:23:19,685
...you got to act like one.
- I guess she's just jealous...

872
01:23:19,857 --> 01:23:21,586
...because she ain't got what I got.

873
01:23:21,759 --> 01:23:24,887
Quit kidding yourself.
Not only have I got everything you got...

874
01:23:25,063 --> 01:23:27,725
...but a whole lot more.
- Well, you ain't got Little Joe.

875
01:23:27,899 --> 01:23:30,026
And that's the main thing
you got I don't want.

876
01:23:30,201 --> 01:23:32,567
And if I run across any more
secondhand junk...

877
01:23:32,737 --> 01:23:34,932
...I'll pass that on to you.

878
01:23:35,606 --> 01:23:38,541
- Petunia, you can't act like this.
- Oh, can't I?

879
01:23:38,710 --> 01:23:41,838
Why, Jim Henry, I see you've worked
yourself up with an orchestra.

880
01:23:42,013 --> 01:23:44,743
- Yeah.
- Ask the boys to put me in the mood...

881
01:23:44,916 --> 01:23:47,316
...so I can give out.
- With pleasure, Mrs. Jackson.

882
01:23:47,485 --> 01:23:50,386
I suddenly feel a musical urge.

883
01:23:52,056 --> 01:23:56,049
Mrs. Jackson, to your musical urge.

884
01:25:46,003 --> 01:25:48,028
- Give up, general?
- Certainly not.

885
01:25:48,206 --> 01:25:50,367
Well, you might as well.

886
01:25:51,175 --> 01:25:55,669
You haven't forgotten that Little Joe's
six-months' trial period is up tonight?

887
01:25:56,380 --> 01:26:00,749
In fact, I think he has
just 10 minutes left.

888
01:26:00,918 --> 01:26:03,443
That's a lot of time
when we're on the job.

889
01:26:03,621 --> 01:26:05,953
And it looks like he's not
coming down there alone.

890
01:26:06,124 --> 01:26:09,992
Why, it looks like he's gonna bring
Petunia right on down there with him.

891
01:26:27,845 --> 01:26:29,073
Little Joe!

892
01:26:30,114 --> 01:26:31,945
Little Joe!

893
01:26:33,017 --> 01:26:34,416
Look out!

894
01:26:35,186 --> 01:26:39,589
- Hey there, what you think you're..?
- Get out.

895
01:26:58,209 --> 01:27:02,043
Lord, do something about this.
Hear my prayer.

896
01:27:02,213 --> 01:27:05,842
Send down your wrath
and destroy this wicked place.

897
01:28:18,756 --> 01:28:21,623
No, don't!
Little Joe, don't! He'll shoot you!

898
01:28:27,932 --> 01:28:31,766
No! Little Joe! It's Little Joe!

899
01:29:29,727 --> 01:29:31,820
Little Joe.

900
01:29:33,130 --> 01:29:35,030
Little Joe?

901
01:29:40,538 --> 01:29:42,631
This feels familiar.

902
01:29:43,708 --> 01:29:46,575
Oh, me. I'm in for it again.

903
01:29:46,744 --> 01:29:48,644
Little Joe, you got a funny feeling?

904
01:29:48,813 --> 01:29:51,373
I got a feeling, but it ain't funny.

905
01:29:51,549 --> 01:29:53,710
You know, I don't feel no pain now.

906
01:29:53,884 --> 01:29:57,047
Of course you don't.
You're a ghost now, Petunia.

907
01:29:57,221 --> 01:30:00,384
A ghost? You mean we're both dead?

908
01:30:01,792 --> 01:30:03,589
We got killed in that ruckus.

909
01:30:03,761 --> 01:30:06,457
I'm scared of what'll happen
in the next couple of minutes.

910
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:09,724
How do you know what's gonna happen
in the next couple of minutes?

911
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:13,836
Oh, Lord, I know I ain't got no right
asking for forgiveness.

912
01:30:14,004 --> 01:30:17,132
But I was doing all right
until I had that falling out with Petunia.

913
01:30:17,308 --> 01:30:20,766
Little Joe, you didn't throw me over
for Georgia Brown, did you?

914
01:30:20,945 --> 01:30:22,913
Excuse me just a moment, Lord.

915
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:25,014
How come you understand
all that now?

916
01:30:25,182 --> 01:30:28,151
Oh, I see it plain now.
Georgia Brown come around trying...

917
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:31,379
...to take you from me,
but you resisted her.

918
01:30:31,555 --> 01:30:34,524
Ain't this a fine time
to be getting some sense.

919
01:30:34,692 --> 01:30:39,391
Oh, honey, I'm sorry. But then,
I was only human. I didn't understand.

920
01:30:39,597 --> 01:30:41,827
I wonder if the general's
gonna see it that way.

921
01:30:41,999 --> 01:30:44,331
General? What on earth
you talking about now?

922
01:30:44,502 --> 01:30:46,697
I ain't talking about nothing on earth.

923
01:30:46,871 --> 01:30:50,102
I just hope he gets here before
Lucifer Jr. Comes busting in on us.

924
01:30:50,274 --> 01:30:53,869
- Lucifer Jr.? Who's he?
- I ain't got time to explain that now.

925
01:30:54,044 --> 01:30:56,672
General? You coming, general?

926
01:30:56,847 --> 01:30:59,816
- General!
- Little Joe. Stop that shouting.

927
01:30:59,984 --> 01:31:02,817
Yes, sir, general. Yes, sir.

928
01:31:03,621 --> 01:31:06,055
Petunia, we've just balanced
the books on you...

929
01:31:06,223 --> 01:31:09,021
...and find you're eligible
to enter the Pearly Gates.

930
01:31:09,193 --> 01:31:12,128
We're discounting this little setback
tonight because we know...

931
01:31:12,296 --> 01:31:14,628
...you were just acting up
to get Little Joe back.

932
01:31:14,799 --> 01:31:18,166
Oh, thank you, sir. Little Joe
coming along with me too, ain't he?

933
01:31:18,335 --> 01:31:19,962
No, I'm afraid not.

934
01:31:20,137 --> 01:31:21,661
Oh, me.

935
01:31:21,839 --> 01:31:25,275
Little Joe,
we've just finished your ledger.

936
01:31:25,443 --> 01:31:28,071
- I'm afraid you're in the red again.
- I am?

937
01:31:28,245 --> 01:31:31,112
Yes. Our records show
that Georgia Brown...

938
01:31:31,282 --> 01:31:33,250
...got about half the sweepstake money.

939
01:31:33,417 --> 01:31:36,853
The other half was spent at Jim Henry's
and other places like that.

940
01:31:37,021 --> 01:31:39,512
You mean, you kept track
of how he spent that money?

941
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:42,523
Yes, it's all down here.

942
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:45,287
I'm a dead pigeon.

943
01:31:45,463 --> 01:31:49,832
Little Joe, you've heard the final report.
Your account is closed up.

944
01:31:53,604 --> 01:31:55,094
But we've opened...

945
01:31:55,272 --> 01:31:58,799
...a brand-new account for you,
you rascal.

946
01:31:58,976 --> 01:32:01,467
Little Joe, come along to Papa.

947
01:32:01,645 --> 01:32:04,478
And what if I refuses
to budge off this here spot?

948
01:32:04,648 --> 01:32:07,208
Oh, we likes it when souls
needs a little prodding.

949
01:32:07,384 --> 01:32:10,046
- Give me my pitchfork.
- I was only asking, that's all.

950
01:32:10,221 --> 01:32:11,916
- Come on, let's get going.
- No, wait.

951
01:32:12,089 --> 01:32:15,252
- Pappy...
- Junior, sir. Pappy wants to see you.

952
01:32:15,826 --> 01:32:18,454
Georgia Brown
has just give herself to the Lord.

953
01:32:18,629 --> 01:32:22,929
Georgia Brown? Why, that's impossible.
Why, she's the best sinner we've got.

954
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:25,898
She was, but she just repented
all of her sins...

955
01:32:26,070 --> 01:32:29,528
...and, boy, there sure was
a mess of them.

956
01:32:29,707 --> 01:32:31,299
We can't afford to lose her.

957
01:32:31,475 --> 01:32:33,875
Georgia's first act of atonement
was to hand over...

958
01:32:34,044 --> 01:32:36,444
...all of her worldly belongings
to the church.

959
01:32:36,614 --> 01:32:38,514
The church?

960
01:32:39,016 --> 01:32:42,144
That's bad.
Pappy's gonna burn about this.

961
01:32:42,319 --> 01:32:45,755
You know, that's just
what Pappy said about you.

962
01:32:45,923 --> 01:32:49,051
He also told me to take charge
of the Little Joe case.

963
01:32:49,226 --> 01:32:51,387
In fact, you is demoted.

964
01:32:51,562 --> 01:32:53,052
Demoted?

965
01:32:53,230 --> 01:32:54,754
Why, Pappy can't do this to me.

966
01:32:54,932 --> 01:32:58,299
Why, I put the... oh, Pappy!

967
01:32:59,703 --> 01:33:02,604
So long, Junior.

968
01:33:04,275 --> 01:33:06,038
They come and they go.

969
01:33:06,243 --> 01:33:08,040
Yeah, they come and they go.

970
01:33:08,846 --> 01:33:10,677
Georgia Brown atoning?

971
01:33:10,848 --> 01:33:14,249
- Why, this is a great day for us.
- Just a minute, general.

972
01:33:14,418 --> 01:33:18,752
Don't Little Joe get credit in the heavenly
ledger for all that money she took from him?

973
01:33:18,923 --> 01:33:21,050
I must. Let's see.

974
01:33:21,225 --> 01:33:23,591
A fur coat and a diamond bracelet...

975
01:33:23,761 --> 01:33:27,390
According to my figures, that just
puts me under the wire by a nose.

976
01:33:27,565 --> 01:33:30,500
In fact, I'm 2 cents to the good.

977
01:33:30,668 --> 01:33:32,761
Well, it was a tight squeeze,
but I made it.

978
01:33:32,937 --> 01:33:36,600
Little Joe. You ought to know
you can't bargain with the Lord.

979
01:33:36,774 --> 01:33:39,242
You're attempting to take advantage
of a technicality.

980
01:33:39,410 --> 01:33:41,605
- I am?
- For shame, Little Joe.

981
01:33:41,779 --> 01:33:44,907
Are you trying
to rouse the ire of the Lord?

982
01:33:46,317 --> 01:33:48,683
The voice of the Lord.

983
01:33:53,490 --> 01:33:55,321
Yes, Lord.

984
01:33:56,727 --> 01:34:00,458
Yes, Lord. That's about the way
things stand, Lord.

985
01:34:04,101 --> 01:34:05,966
Yes, Lord.

986
01:34:07,738 --> 01:34:12,141
Come, Petunia.
The golden chariot's waiting for you.

987
01:34:13,544 --> 01:34:15,011
No.

988
01:34:15,179 --> 01:34:18,706
Oh, Lord, please be patient
and listen to me again.

989
01:34:19,216 --> 01:34:23,414
I'm not asking you to take Little Joe
to heaven if he don't belong there.

990
01:34:23,587 --> 01:34:27,785
And, Lord, getting to heaven
has been the main thought in my life.

991
01:34:27,958 --> 01:34:32,122
But somehow it never crossed my mind
I'd be going there without Little Joe.

992
01:34:32,296 --> 01:34:36,062
And as I am to blame for all this,
I can't leave him.

993
01:34:36,233 --> 01:34:39,327
I just can't leave him, Lord.

994
01:35:53,177 --> 01:35:55,907
- Long climb, ain't it?
- It ain't much farther.

995
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:59,208
I'm feeling kind of funny.
You think I can make it?

996
01:35:59,383 --> 01:36:01,476
Sure, you can make it.
Yes, you can make it.

997
01:36:01,652 --> 01:36:04,485
I'm getting kind of weary.

998
01:36:04,655 --> 01:36:07,488
- Can I make it?
- Yes, you can make it.

999
01:36:07,658 --> 01:36:09,853
Do you think I can make it?

1000
01:36:10,327 --> 01:36:11,919
Petunia.

1001
01:36:12,096 --> 01:36:13,586
Can I make it?

1002
01:36:13,764 --> 01:36:15,698
Can I make it, Petunia?

1003
01:36:15,866 --> 01:36:17,663
Can I make it?

1004
01:36:20,304 --> 01:36:21,635
Petunia.

1005
01:36:21,805 --> 01:36:23,602
Are you all right, Petunia? Petunia.

1006
01:36:23,774 --> 01:36:25,639
- Petunia. Are you all right?
- Of course.

1007
01:36:25,809 --> 01:36:27,709
They didn't get you.
Doctor, do something.

1008
01:36:27,878 --> 01:36:29,641
- Lay him down.
- Lay down, dear. Quiet.

1009
01:36:29,813 --> 01:36:31,542
Do something.

1010
01:36:41,091 --> 01:36:45,494
Why, the fever's way down.
He's going to be all right.

1011
01:36:46,063 --> 01:36:50,659
All he needs now is plenty of rest.
And he's likely to be hungry pretty soon.

1012
01:36:50,834 --> 01:36:52,768
Oh, I'll take care of that.

1013
01:36:52,936 --> 01:36:57,100
Don't you worry about him, now,
and I'll call in again later on.

1014
01:36:58,175 --> 01:37:00,166
And you'd better get some rest yourself.

1015
01:37:00,344 --> 01:37:04,212
Oh, I don't need any rest.
I got new strength now.

1016
01:37:07,951 --> 01:37:09,851
What's the matter, darling? You in pain?

1017
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:13,478
No, I just remembered something.
Kind of a dream I had, I guess.

1018
01:37:13,657 --> 01:37:14,919
Oh, Petunia.

1019
01:37:15,092 --> 01:37:17,424
- Oh, Petunia.
- Now, Joe.

1020
01:37:17,594 --> 01:37:20,495
Petunia, get me that sweepstake ticket.

1021
01:37:25,536 --> 01:37:28,164
And them dice too.
They're on the bureau.

1022
01:37:32,042 --> 01:37:34,237
Now burn them.
Burn them up, right away.

1023
01:37:34,411 --> 01:37:37,505
All right, darling.
Put these in the stove, Lily.

1024
01:37:37,681 --> 01:37:40,912
Joe, what made you
think of that right now?

1025
01:37:41,084 --> 01:37:42,346
Petunia, you was right.

1026
01:37:42,519 --> 01:37:45,852
You was right about me gambling
and the bad company I was keeping.

1027
01:37:46,023 --> 01:37:48,253
I almost didn't get into heaven
on account of it.

1028
01:37:48,425 --> 01:37:50,655
Get into heaven?
What are you talking about, Joe?

1029
01:37:50,828 --> 01:37:52,887
I had a narrow escape, I'll tell you that.

1030
01:37:53,063 --> 01:37:56,931
- And if it hadn't been for you, Petunia...
- oh, well, let's not talk about that now.

1031
01:37:57,100 --> 01:38:00,866
Let's talk about how happy you've
made me now that you've come back.

1032
