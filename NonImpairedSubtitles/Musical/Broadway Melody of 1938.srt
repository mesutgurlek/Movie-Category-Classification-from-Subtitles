00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:10,096
Nicki. That was beautiful.
That was magnificent.

4
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:12,700
I've heard worse than that at the opera.
Haven't you?

5
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:15,531
Oh. You know opera ain't as bad
as it sounds.

6
00:04:15,705 --> 00:04:17,104
And not only can Nicki sing...

7
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:20,333
...but he can pick horses too.
SONNY: Who do you like in the big race...

8
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,411
...at Baltimore tomorrow?
- I got a hunch on Star Gazer.

9
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:25,444
Oh. That's a swell little horse.

10
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:27,173
Hey. Wait a minute. Get this.

That's just the job for me.

She pays the biggest wages at the track.

15
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:41,061
She can. She's one of the richest
chorus girls in the world.

16
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,357
- Is that so?
- Sure. She married Herman Whipple.

17
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,024
- You know. The Iceberg Sucker king.
- Is that the truth?

18
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,466
There's a picture of them

Peter. You and I
are going to Baltimore tonight.

21
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,037
What are we gonna use for money?

22
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,202
I don't know. But I know
I gotta get that job.

23
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,745
Nicki...

24
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:01,443
...I wanna give you a little tip.
- Thank you.

25
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:03,744
No. I mean on tomorrow's race
at Pimlico.

26
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,321
Don't talk about horses.
I wouldn't bet on another horse...

27
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,586
...if the horse talked to me personal.
- Don't forget the old adage.

28
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:14,992
- Nothing ventured. Nothing gained.
- Don't you forget that old adage.

29
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:17,962
That two rolling mosses gathers a bird
in the bushes.

30
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:19,601
George. You got something there.

31
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:22,465
There's a little horse in the big race
called Fast Asleep.

32
00:05:22,638 --> 00:05:25,471
L... Fast Asleep?
What kind of horse is that?

33
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:28,201
- Forty-to-one shot.
- Smartest racehorse in the country.

34
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:30,869
- Last time out he won by a lip.
- A lip?

35
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:33,140
- He puckered.
- Puckered?

36
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:36,444
- Oh. A smart horse.
- Peter. That sounds like the best bet to me.

37
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:41,022
It's a cinch. Nicki. You give us 20 bucks
and we'll place it for you at the track.

38
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,488
- How much could I win?
- Twenty will get you 800.

39
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:44,819
Come on. What do you say?

40
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:47,360
You heard what my uncle said.
No more bets.

41
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,930
- And I mean it.
- Eight hundred bucks ain't buttons.

42
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:53,125
Buttons. Who wants buttons?
I got buttons.

43
00:05:53,302 --> 00:05:56,100
I want bucks. L...

44
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,869
How much you got to put up
for the 800?

45
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:01,772
George. Old pal.
It will only cost you 20 bucks.

46
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,816
No. Absotively. No. I only...

47
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,313
Nicki. Come here.

48
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:13,614
Listen. This time I got a hunch.

49
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,588
When your Uncle George has got a hunch.
He's got something.

50
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,092
What do you say we both put 10 bucks
apiece on Fast Asleep's nose?

51
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:21,560
How's about it? Do you?

52
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:24,825
- Okay. Uncle George.
- That's right.

53
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:29,838
Here. L... Oh.

54
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:31,530
Here's your 20 bucks.

55
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:34,801
And for your sake. I hope the horse
don't get sleepy in the race.

56
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:38,071
- You can bet he'll win.
- What? Ain't that what I'm doing?

57
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:40,715
Wait a minute. George.
You got nothing to worry about.

58
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:42,407
PETER: Goodbye. Nicki.
- So long. George.

59
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:45,213
So long you bring me back the 800 bucks
it's all right.

60
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:49,347
And no monkey business.
And don't give me the cross double.

00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:40,836
My pet. That is the greatest slogan
I ever thought of.

75
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,275
- You paid $ 10.000 for it. Didn't you?
- Yes. But I thought of buying it.

76
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:46,972
Herman. Our train leaves at 9:00.
We'd better be going.

77
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,550
Yes. Of course.
My dear. At once. Bertram.

78
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,711
I'm leaving for Pimlico.
If anyone calls. Say that I'm out.

79
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,289
- Make no appointments.
- But you have an appointment.

80
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,790
- Mr. Raleigh is waiting.
- Of course. Young Raleigh.

81
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,428
- Can't you see him some other time. Dear?
- No. My pet.

82
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:03,827
Raleigh is the man who wrote the songs
you heard on our radio program.

83
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,401
He wants to produce a musical show
and I'm going to back it for him.

84
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,199
Oh. So you're going to be an angel
and put thousands of dollars into a show...

85
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:13,137
...for someone you know nothing about.

86
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:17,177
My pet. I'm always the businessman
and never neglect to investigate first.

87
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:20,247
I even checked on you
before we were married.

88
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,180
How nice.
Did you find anything interesting?

89
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:25,980
Several things. My dear.
That's why I married you.

90
00:08:26,155 --> 00:08:28,282
Bertram. Read me the report
on Mr. Raleigh.

91
00:08:28,457 --> 00:08:30,652
Herman. You're not putting my money...

92
00:08:30,826 --> 00:08:33,488
I mean our money into this stupid show.

93
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:38,657
- But. My pet. I have already agreed.
- I'll settle that. Show the gentleman in.

94
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,729
So you checked on me
before we were married. Eh?

95
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:44,372
Well. Brad Street
didn't do you any harm either.

96
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:49,039
- Hello. Mr. Whipple.
- Hello. Steve.

97
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,938
Oh. I'm... I'm sorry.
I thought you were alone.

98
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,379
I am. I mean. This is Mrs. Whipple.
Mr. Raleigh.

99
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,951
- How do you do. Ms. Whipple?
- How do you do?

100
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,214
- I've been hearing a lot about you.
STEVE: Good. I hope.

101
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,053
I brought the contracts and
I think they're exactly as you requested.

102
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:08,894
I put up my show. Book. Lyrics.
And music. Against your money.

103
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:11,829
If it's a hit. We split fifty-fifty.
If it's a flop...

104
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:15,198
...well. Then. We'll all be sorry. Okay?

105
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:18,067
Steve. Mrs. Whipple and I
have been talking this over.

106
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:19,936
And she doesn't quite approve...

107
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:22,737
...of my making any theatrical investments
at this time.

108
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:26,814
I should like to have you release me
from my promise. Will you?

109
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,351
Of course. I wouldn't hold you to it
if Mrs. Whipple objected.

110
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,748
But I didn't object.

111
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:35,482
If you want to break your word
with Mr. Raleigh...

112
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,286
...don't use me as your excuse.
- But didn't you say...?

113
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:41,123
I simply said
that I didn't know Mr. Raleigh.

114
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:45,324
Now that I do. I'm terribly enthusiastic
about the whole idea.

115
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:47,561
Thank you. Mrs. Whipple.

116
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:51,063
I wish there were producers like you
when I was in the chorus.

117
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:55,707
- Come. Herman. Sign the contract.
- Yes. My dove. Yes.

118
00:09:57,546 --> 00:09:59,639
By the way.
Why don't we invite Mr. Raleigh...

119
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:01,476
...to Pimlico with us?
- Will you?

120
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:04,882
Mrs. Whipple's horse. Star Gazer.
Is running in the big race tomorrow.

121
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:07,022
Why not come along
and help us root him in?

122
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,178
Well...

123
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:10,555
Do you like horses. Mr. Raleigh?

124
00:10:10,726 --> 00:10:12,557
Oh. Yes. Very much indeed but...

125
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:15,060
Well. At least we have one thing
in common.

126
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:18,723
ANNOUNCER: <i>They're rounding the turn</i>
<i>toward the stretch. What a beautiful sight.</i>

127
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:21,870
<i>Star Gazer and Fast Asleep</i>
<i>shoot out in front by two lengths.</i>

128
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,905
<i>They're increasing to four lengths.</i>
<i>Both jocks use the whips.</i>

129
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:29,067
<i>The battle is on in the home stretch. Jocks</i>
<i>are calling for that last ounce of speed.</i>

130
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:32,544
<i>Star Gazer in front by a head.</i>
<i>Now it's Fast Asleep by a nose.</i>

131
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,275
<i>They're even. Eye to eye</i>
<i>as they speed toward the line.</i>

132
00:10:35,451 --> 00:10:37,442
<i>Fighting furiously for an added inch.</i>

133
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,088
<i>There they go,</i>
<i>nose and nose under the wire.</i>

134
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,658
- <i>It's a photographic finish.</i>
- That was a close finish.

135
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:48,092
I got a hunch we should have placed
that 20 bucks on Fast Asleep.

136
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:50,095
It's a fine time to be getting hunches.

137
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:53,326
We had to use that dough to get here
to Baltimore to get this job.

138
00:10:53,502 --> 00:10:55,993
If that horse puckered. We're sunk.

139
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:58,963
<i>We just got the results</i>
<i>of the photographic finish.</i>

140
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:00,768
<i>The winner, Fast Asleep.</i>

141
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:02,467
I win $800.

142
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:06,081
- But half of that is mine.
- Don't be technical. I win!

143
00:11:06,716 --> 00:11:09,685
Herman. What do you suppose
ever happened to Star Gazer?

144
00:11:09,852 --> 00:11:11,012
I didn't know. Dear.

145
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,616
It looks like he's pulled a tendon.
All right.

146
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,724
Yes. He'd have won that race
if he hadn't.

147
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:20,089
You bet he would. You wanna rub
his leg down good and bandage it.

We're pulling out for New York
on the 6:45 train.

- It's on the siding.

- Okay. Mr. Blakeley.

- Have you had any experience?

152
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:35,407
I used to be a jockey.

- What did you ride? Elephants?
- No. I was a little guy then.

- Six-feet-one in my underwear.

- Well. It's none of my business...

...but why don't you put his leg
right in the tub?

158
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:01,465
Why don't you go back out to the track
and see the 8th race?

159
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,663
It's better for the horse's leg
if his foot's right in the water.

160
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,139
Well. If you don't mind.
I'll do this my way.

I wouldn't do a thing
without asking you.

Hey. What's going on there?

164
00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:31,430
You gotta take care of this quickly.
Pulling a tendon is plenty serious.

165
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,933
Some horses are laid up for months
and sometimes they never run again.

- Leg brace.

Run and get her some bandages.

- It's in pretty bad shape. Mrs. Whipple.

178
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:14,769
I'm afraid Star Gazer will be laid up
for quite a while.

Oh. That's ridiculous.

He should be turned out

299
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:02,463
No. Seriously.
What are you gonna do in New York?

300
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,622
- Try to find work.
- At the track?

301
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,132
No. On Broadway.

302
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,793
Well. That's the fastest track
in the world.

303
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,529
So I've heard.

304
00:23:11,706 --> 00:23:14,140
Do you know where Hamilton Brown's
casting office is?

305
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,470
No. No. I don't.

306
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,203
- I do.
- You do?

307
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,575
Sure. I've spent days waiting
in that office.

308
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:22,808
Swell. Now. Iook.
Will you see that Miss...?

309
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,976
Lee. Sally Lee.

310
00:23:27,722 --> 00:23:30,452
Uh... Will you see that Miss Lee
gets there and asks for Mr. Brown?

311
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,649
- I sure will.
- Be sure now.

312
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:32,919
CAROLINE:
Steve?

313
00:23:35,697 --> 00:23:38,222
- Well. Goodbye. Miss Lee.
- Goodbye.

314
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:40,496
See you later.

315
00:24:01,623 --> 00:24:04,854
- What are you. A prowler?
- I was on the platform getting some air...

316
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,426
...and I heard you playing the piano.
So I listened.

317
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,059
- Oh. An eavesdropper. Huh?
- It was lovely.

318
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:13,394
- Will you play some more?
- Lf you'll come in.

319
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,001
Oh. No. I wouldn't dare.

320
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,798
No. Don't be afraid. Come on in.

321
00:24:18,673 --> 00:24:21,870
- Say. Did you ever write a song?
- Oh. Sure.

322
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,204
When I was 6 years old.
But it was terrible.

323
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,075
- Well. I'm afraid mine is too.
- You mean the one you were playing?

324
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:29,843
- Mm-hm.
- Oh. That's beautiful.

325
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:32,418
- You really think so?
- Oh. I wouldn't fool you.

326
00:24:32,587 --> 00:24:35,351
- Let's hear the words.
- That's just the trouble.

327
00:24:35,524 --> 00:24:36,821
I haven't finished them yet.

328
00:24:36,992 --> 00:24:40,860
I got the chorus all right. But I certainly
dried up when I got to the verse.

329
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:42,496
Hey. How about you helping me?

330
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:43,688
- Me?
- Sure.

331
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:45,730
If you can write a song when you're 6...

332
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,495
...you ought to be able
to give me a suggestion now.

333
00:24:50,772 --> 00:24:53,172
"Words and music by Steve Raleigh."

334
00:24:53,341 --> 00:24:55,241
- That's you. Isn't it?
- Yeah.

335
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,674
- Lovely name.
- But it doesn't seem to rhyme...

336
00:24:57,846 --> 00:25:01,873
...with what I'm trying to write here.
- But it ought to be good for a start.

337
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,075
Start. That's it.

338
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,618
- Say. You're great.
- What did I do?

339
00:25:06,788 --> 00:25:10,451
You'll find out. I've got a feeling
you're lucky coming in here like this.

340
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:12,422
Lucky. Lucky. That's it.

341
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,427
- Oh. You're marvelous.
- What did I do now?

342
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:19,089
- Practically finished it for me.
- But I haven't said anything yet.

343
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:23,636
- Of course. It would make me happy...
- Happy. Happy. Happy. That does it.

344
00:25:24,072 --> 00:25:26,597
There you are. You finished it.

345
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,802
- You mean. I've written the verse?
- Exactly.

346
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,943
Are you sure you're feeling all right?

347
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:35,241
Absolutely. Now. Come on. Sing it for me.

348
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:37,885
- But I'll wake up everybody.
- Don't worry about that.

349
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:40,044
Now take the verse nice and slow-like.

350
00:25:40,222 --> 00:25:41,917
Oh. No. You sing it.

351
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,490
Me? If I sang one note.
They'd stop the train...

352
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:46,854
...come running back
looking for a flat wheel.

353
00:25:47,028 --> 00:25:49,553
- Now. Come on. Sing it.
- But after all. It's your song.

354
00:25:49,731 --> 00:25:51,858
No. It isn't. It's yours and mine.

How do you do?
I'd like to see Mr. Brown.

381
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,315
What do you want and who are you?

382
00:27:53,488 --> 00:27:55,820
Why. I am Alice Clayton.
Surely you've heard of me.

383
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,981
- The name is familiar.
- So it should be.

384
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,684
It represents 80 years
in the American theater.

385
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:05,128
Really. I must say. Madam.
You carry it very well.

386
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,165
You idiot. I was speaking of my family.

387
00:28:07,335 --> 00:28:10,099
- I was a child of the theater.
- Oh. I see. Yes.

388
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:14,173
Now I am a mother.
She. Too. Is a child of the theater.

389
00:28:14,342 --> 00:28:17,038
Born in a dressing room.
Raised in a wardrobe trunk.

390
00:28:17,212 --> 00:28:18,577
How romantic.

391
00:28:18,747 --> 00:28:22,183
Believe me. If I'd known show business
would turn out what it has today...

392
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,717
...I would've slammed the lid down on her.
- Oh. How very ghastly.

393
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:29,448
There you are.
The last and youngest of a royal family.

394
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:34,717
And it is my hope that she will carry on
for the Claytons.

395
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:37,558
- Oh. The Claytons are a bunch of hams.
- Betty.

396
00:28:37,732 --> 00:28:39,324
I'm sorry. Ma. It slipped out.

397
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:43,403
- You see. She is too young for her talent.
- Yes. Really. Yes.

00:28:43,571 --> 00:28:47,234
Mr. Brown is busy with Steve Raleigh
lining up a cast for his new show.

399
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:49,274
But that's what I came to see him about.

400
00:28:49,444 --> 00:28:53,847
Yes. So I gathered.
Well. You'll have to wait.

401
00:28:54,516 --> 00:28:56,108
Who's this?

402
00:28:56,284 --> 00:28:59,651
Marie Charnelle. The sensation
of the Folies Bergere in Paris.

403
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,311
And I can get her for you.

404
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,185
To Marie Charnelle
and Steve's new show.

405
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:06,088
Thanks. Duffy.

406
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:08,591
- How much?
- Fifteen hundred a week.

407
00:29:08,763 --> 00:29:10,128
That's too much.

408
00:29:10,298 --> 00:29:14,029
To Steve's new show.
Without Marie Charnelle.

409
00:29:15,603 --> 00:29:17,298
Who is she?

410
00:29:17,705 --> 00:29:20,697
Lucille Burton.
The best tap dancer in the world.

411
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:24,470
And for a 20-week guarantee.
I could get her for $2000 a week.

412
00:29:24,646 --> 00:29:26,307
And her name's worth it.

413
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:30,440
To Steve's new show and Lucille Burton.

414
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:33,786
- It's too much. Brown.
- With that millionaire Whipple behind...

415
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:36,617
I'm not putting on this show
to make money out of Whipple.

416
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:39,783
He's my partner. I make money for him.
She's out of the question.

417
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:42,327
- To Steve's new show...
- Without Lucille Burton...

418
00:29:42,497 --> 00:29:45,694
...or any more highballs.
- Okay. Boss.

419
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,698
Don't suppose you saw
the morning papers?

420
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,598
- Yes. They're great. Duffy.
- Great.

421
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:53,867
Why. Your press campaign for the past
two weeks has been colossal. Stupendous.

422
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,806
Your show isn't in rehearsal yet.
And around Times Square...

423
00:29:56,978 --> 00:29:58,502
...your name is a household word.

424
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,513
I don't remember what the word is now.
But it's a big one.

425
00:30:01,683 --> 00:30:03,446
And who did all this for you?

426
00:30:03,618 --> 00:30:05,848
- You did.
- You guessed it.

427
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,011
And now I'm going to do something
for you.

428
00:30:08,189 --> 00:30:10,248
Here's the $200 you loaned me
when things were tough.

429
00:30:10,425 --> 00:30:13,792
- Why. I can hardly believe it.
- You can't believe I'd pay you back?

430
00:30:13,962 --> 00:30:16,123
I can hardy believe
I ever had it to lend to you.

431
00:30:16,297 --> 00:30:18,390
You did. There's your
first two weeks' salary.

432
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:21,763
Oh. This is too much. Steve.
I feel faint.

433
00:30:23,438 --> 00:30:25,838
- I feel better.
- Right. But see that you carry on...

434
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:29,067
...where you left off. I expect something
in the papers every day.

435
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,077
Okay. But you gotta give me
something to write about now.

436
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,181
Gonna have a big name in the show.
I suppose.

437
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:36,681
Well. He should have
if he expects to put it over.

438
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:38,944
That's why this Lucille Burton
is a great buy.

439
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,054
I can't use her. Brown.
In the first place...

440
00:30:41,222 --> 00:30:44,020
...she's not the greatest tap dancer
in the world. Because I've got her.

441
00:30:44,192 --> 00:30:45,216
- Yeah?
- Yes.

442
00:30:45,393 --> 00:30:46,382
- Who?
- Sally Lee.

443
00:30:46,561 --> 00:30:47,994
- Never heard of her.
- So did I.

444
00:30:48,162 --> 00:30:49,925
You'll hear plenty when they see her.

445
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,658
- Where did you find her?
- In a boxcar.

446
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:54,734
- I beg your pardon.
- In a boxcar.

447
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:57,997
- You know. The thing they carry horses in.
- With a horse?

448
00:30:58,172 --> 00:31:00,231
- Yes.
- Let me get this straight.

449
00:31:00,408 --> 00:31:03,002
- You found a girl and a horse in a boxcar?
- Right.

450
00:31:03,177 --> 00:31:04,872
- And she's a great dancer?
- Right.

451
00:31:05,046 --> 00:31:06,638
- You mean the girl?
- Yes. The girl.

452
00:31:06,814 --> 00:31:10,079
That's a relief. And you're gonna put her
in the lead in the new show.

453
00:31:10,251 --> 00:31:12,981
I certainly am.
I've seen her do several dances...

454
00:31:13,154 --> 00:31:15,622
...and I've heard her sing the songs.
I'm sold on her.

455
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,884
But. Steve. You can't put a show over
with an unknown in the lead.

456
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,689
Why can't I? The picture people do it.
They're giving some unknown a chance...

457
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:25,560
...praying to make good
so they can cash in on a new star.

458
00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:27,064
But pictures are different.

459
00:31:27,235 --> 00:31:30,261
They print them on celluloid.
If the girl doesn't make good...

460
00:31:30,438 --> 00:31:32,599
...they can just take
a pair of scissors and...

461
00:31:32,774 --> 00:31:34,173
...cut her out like that.

462
00:31:34,342 --> 00:31:38,506
This girl gets on the stage and she has
to stay there until the curtain comes down.

463
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,672
By that time. You'll be over in Newark
looking for a new backer.

464
00:31:41,849 --> 00:31:45,808
I'll be apologizing to the newspaper boys
for having called you a smart producer.

465
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,387
Well. Don't start apologizing
until you've seen her.

466
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:50,820
- Where is she?
- She'll be up here today.

467
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:55,359
There's a strange woman outside
with a child who insists upon seeing you.

468
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,724
Have her arrested.

469
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:05,532
Mr. Brown wants to know
what the kid does.

470
00:32:05,707 --> 00:32:08,039
Oh. He does. Does he?
Well. We'd like to show him.

471
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:10,541
No. He's terribly busy now.
He can't hear anyone.

472
00:32:10,712 --> 00:32:14,341
- What's the matter. Is he deaf?
- Well. He was the last time I asked him...

473
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,846
...for a raise.

474
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,577
Listen. You. We came here for a purpose.

475
00:32:18,753 --> 00:32:22,519
Mr. Brown is gonna hear Betty sing today.
If she has to sing here in this office.

476
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,124
Well. Go ahead and sing. See if I care.

477
00:32:25,293 --> 00:32:27,989
- Oh. Mom. I'd rather not.
- Oh. Don't be silly. Little girl.

478
00:32:28,162 --> 00:32:32,064
You go right ahead.
Sing to your heart's content.

479
00:32:32,233 --> 00:32:35,168
All right. Betty. Go ahead and sing
and sing loud.

Someone with experience.

01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:55,482
I guess you got a lot of girls
that tell you the same thing.

1202
01:16:55,651 --> 01:16:59,610
And if you don't wanna read this.
Well. You don't have to.

1203
01:17:00,188 --> 01:17:04,318
But I just had to tell you about the time
I saw you in <i>It Happened One Night.</i>

1204
01:17:04,493 --> 01:17:06,757
That was the first time I ever saw you.

1205
01:17:06,928 --> 01:17:10,864
And I knew right then
you were the nicest fellow in the movies.

1206
01:17:11,066 --> 01:17:16,003
I guess it was because you acted so.
Well. So natural like.

1207
01:17:16,505 --> 01:17:21,340
Not like a real actor at all. But just like any
fellow you'd meet at school or at a party.

1208
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:24,946
And then one time I saw you in a picture
with Joan Crawford...

1209
01:17:25,113 --> 01:17:30,210
...and I had to cry a little
because you loved her so much...

1210
01:17:30,385 --> 01:17:32,512
...and you couldn't have her.

1211
01:17:33,221 --> 01:17:35,883
Not till the end of the picture. Anyway.

1212
01:17:36,058 --> 01:17:38,424
And then one time I saw you in person.

1213
01:17:38,593 --> 01:17:41,153
You were making a personal appearance.
And I was standing there...

1214
01:17:41,329 --> 01:17:44,093
...when you got out of your car.
And you almost knocked me down.

1215
01:17:44,266 --> 01:17:46,700
Oh. But it wasn't your fault.

1216
01:17:46,902 --> 01:17:49,370
No. I was in the way.

1217
01:17:49,771 --> 01:17:53,935
But you looked at me and you smiled.

1218
01:17:54,109 --> 01:17:56,441
Yeah. You smiled right at me.
As if you meant it...

1219
01:17:56,611 --> 01:18:00,547
...and I cried all the way home just because
you smiled at me for being in your way.

1220
01:18:00,716 --> 01:18:02,911
Oh. I'll never forget it. Mr. Gable.

1221
01:18:03,085 --> 01:18:07,215
Honest Injun. You're my favorite actor.

1222
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:12,959
<i>I don't care what happens</i>
<i>Let the whole world stop</i>

1223
01:18:13,128 --> 01:18:18,122
<i>As far as I'm concerned</i>
<i>You'll always be the top</i>

1224
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:24,068
<i>'Cause you know you made me</i>

1225
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:31,236
<i>Love you</i>

1226
01:18:54,236 --> 01:18:55,897
Here's to Steve's new show.

1227
01:18:56,071 --> 01:18:58,471
Yeah. It's plenty rough in spots.

1228
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,130
Hey. Burt. Come here.

1229
01:19:00,609 --> 01:19:02,873
You've gotta clean up that finish.
It's no good.

1230
01:19:03,044 --> 01:19:06,070
They're all tired out. It's after 1:00.

1231
01:19:06,248 --> 01:19:07,943
We'll call it quits for tonight.

1232
01:19:08,116 --> 01:19:10,414
All right. Girls. You can all go home.

1233
01:19:10,585 --> 01:19:11,609
[WOMEN CLAPPING]

1234
01:19:11,787 --> 01:19:13,914
See that you go home.
I'll expect you in the morning.

1235
01:19:14,089 --> 01:19:17,058
Ten o'clock in the morning. Girls.
Be here on time. No alibis.

1236
01:19:17,225 --> 01:19:18,817
STEVE:
Sally.

1237
01:19:18,994 --> 01:19:20,689
Come here a minute.

1238
01:19:24,499 --> 01:19:26,091
Sit down.

1239
01:19:28,303 --> 01:19:29,998
I didn't like your rehearsal today.

1240
01:19:31,206 --> 01:19:32,764
I'm sorry.

1241
01:19:32,941 --> 01:19:36,433
That love scene was pretty bad.
You didn't mean it.

1242
01:19:36,611 --> 01:19:37,908
But I tried.

1243
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:40,707
That's probably just the trouble.
You're trying too hard.

1244
01:19:40,882 --> 01:19:44,875
No. Just be simple and sincere.
Now come on. Read that line for me.

1245
01:19:45,053 --> 01:19:47,521
- Which one?
- The one where you say. "I love you."

1246
01:19:47,689 --> 01:19:49,816
I love you. Really I do.

1247
01:19:49,991 --> 01:19:52,482
I love you with all my heart.

1248
01:19:53,195 --> 01:19:56,631
Well. That's more like it.
Why didn't you say it like that at rehearsal?

1249
01:19:56,798 --> 01:19:58,459
I'll try to do it better tomorrow.

1250
01:19:58,633 --> 01:20:00,965
Be sure you do. It's very important.

1251
01:20:01,536 --> 01:20:03,003
Sally.

1252
01:20:03,171 --> 01:20:04,661
Yes?

1253
01:20:06,641 --> 01:20:11,078
- I'm sorry I had to pick on you today.
- Oh. That's all right. I understand.

1254
01:20:11,246 --> 01:20:13,646
Remember I told you
we'd be lucky if we were still speaking...

1255
01:20:13,815 --> 01:20:16,147
...to each other at the end of rehearsals?
- Uh-huh.

1256
01:20:16,685 --> 01:20:19,085
Speaking of rehearsals.
Let me hear that line again.

1257
01:20:19,254 --> 01:20:20,846
I wanna see if you remember it.

1258
01:20:21,022 --> 01:20:25,049
Why don't you read it for me.
Then I can tell what you really mean.

1259
01:20:25,594 --> 01:20:27,027
All right.

1260
01:20:28,964 --> 01:20:31,865
I love you. Really I do.

1261
01:20:32,033 --> 01:20:33,933
I love you with all my heart.

1262
01:20:34,102 --> 01:20:35,592
That sounded nice. Steve.

1263
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:37,670
Now let me try it again.

1264
01:20:37,839 --> 01:20:40,399
I love you. Really I do.

1265
01:20:40,575 --> 01:20:43,066
I love you with all my heart.

1266
01:20:43,311 --> 01:20:44,642
CAROLINE:
Steve.

1267
01:20:44,813 --> 01:20:48,374
If you two can stop loving each other
with all your hearts for one moment...

1268
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:50,950
...I'd like to see you in the office.

1269
01:20:52,254 --> 01:20:54,814
You better run along home. Sally.
And get some rest.

1270
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:58,255
- You've got a big day tomorrow.
- All right. Steve.

1271
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:07,967
- Well?
- Herman. Are you going to tell Steve...

1272
01:21:08,136 --> 01:21:09,763
...or shall I?
- Oh. Yes. Dear.

1273
01:21:09,938 --> 01:21:13,339
Steve. We have some rather bad news
for you.

1274
01:21:13,508 --> 01:21:15,499
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yes. So am I.

1275
01:21:15,677 --> 01:21:20,011
But we've come to the conclusion. Steve.
That we can't go on with the show.

1276
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:24,844
Here now. Wait a minute.
We're partners. We made a deal.

1277
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:27,853
That's right. So we did.
Steve's right. My dear.

1278
01:21:28,023 --> 01:21:30,548
We didn't agree to waste your money
on an unknown girl.

1279
01:21:30,725 --> 01:21:32,454
I know the idea of a Broadway show...

1280
01:21:32,627 --> 01:21:36,586
...resting on an unknown may sound foolish.
But that's been my plan from the first.

1281
01:21:36,765 --> 01:21:40,565
New faces. Fresh talent. That's the idea
you bought when you agreed to finance me.

1282
01:21:40,735 --> 01:21:42,862
We didn't agree
to finance your love affairs.

1283
01:21:43,038 --> 01:21:44,130
I hardly expected that.

1284
01:21:44,306 --> 01:21:46,536
I suppose you're not in love
with the girl?

1285
01:21:46,708 --> 01:21:47,834
Yes. I am.

1286
01:21:48,009 --> 01:21:51,001
If I didn't think she'd make good.
I'd never had her in the show.

1287
01:21:51,179 --> 01:21:53,044
I don't suppose
you can understand that.

1288
01:21:53,214 --> 01:21:56,741
Herman. Are you gonna sit there
and let him talk to me like that?

1289
01:21:56,918 --> 01:21:58,943
Certainly not. My dear.

1290
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,382
What did he say?

1291
01:22:01,289 --> 01:22:04,087
I want you to tell Steve
that unless the girl leaves...

1292
01:22:04,259 --> 01:22:06,523
...you're withdrawing
your financial support.

1293
01:22:06,695 --> 01:22:10,324
That's right. Steve. You can't have
two angels in one show. Can you?

1294
01:22:10,498 --> 01:22:11,863
I'll do the show without you.

1295
01:22:12,033 --> 01:22:14,297
But according to our contract.
I own half of it.

1296
01:22:14,469 --> 01:22:17,097
Not if you fail to go through with it.
You don't.

1297
01:22:17,272 --> 01:22:22,733
Mr. Raleigh forgets. Dear.
That you hold his personal note for $ 1250...

1298
01:22:22,911 --> 01:22:28,440
...and if it isn't repaid within 60 days.
Even his half of the show is yours. Darling.

1299
01:22:28,616 --> 01:22:30,846
That's right. Dear.
I'd forgotten about that.

1300
01:22:31,019 --> 01:22:34,682
Now. You shouldn't have given me a note
like that. Steve. That was a mistake.

1301
01:22:34,856 --> 01:22:38,485
- How did you ever come to do that?
- Mr. Raleigh's romantic. Dear.

1302
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:41,561
Of course. That's something
you wouldn't understand.

1303
01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:44,028
Here. Let's go.

1304
01:22:54,042 --> 01:22:56,840
- So they walked out on you. Eh?
- Yep.

1305
01:22:57,012 --> 01:22:59,708
Well. Here's to Steve's new show
without Sally Lee.

1306
01:22:59,881 --> 01:23:03,373
Don't you believe it. I'll find another backer.
And she'll be in the show.

1307
01:23:03,551 --> 01:23:07,009
Now listen. Steve. Any guy
that would give up a city bankroll...

1308
01:23:07,188 --> 01:23:10,214
...for a farmer's daughter.
If he isn't crazy. Then I am.

1309
01:23:10,392 --> 01:23:13,190
You can't do this. You can't throw away
that Whipple money...

1310
01:23:13,361 --> 01:23:15,693
...just on account of this Sally Lee girl.

1311
01:23:15,864 --> 01:23:19,322
You can find hoofers all over town.
You'll never find another like Whipple.

1312
01:23:19,501 --> 01:23:21,492
STEVE:
Oh. Don't worry about it. He's out.

1313
01:23:21,669 --> 01:23:23,330
Listen. Now use your head. Will you?

1314
01:23:23,505 --> 01:23:25,837
The Whipples will back the show
if the girl is out.

1315
01:23:26,007 --> 01:23:28,840
Forget about her
and do it Mrs. Whipple's way.

1316
01:23:29,010 --> 01:23:32,969
Make a name for yourself first and
then you can star the girl and her horse.

1317
01:23:33,148 --> 01:23:34,445
Forget it. Will you. Duffy?

1318
01:23:38,186 --> 01:23:39,847
Sally.

1319
01:23:41,456 --> 01:23:42,923
Yes?

1320
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,790
- I thought you'd gone home.
- I'm leaving now.

1321
01:23:47,962 --> 01:23:49,827
- Wait. I'll go with you.
- Don't bother.

1322
01:23:49,998 --> 01:23:52,489
- I'd rather go alone.
- All right.

1323
01:23:52,667 --> 01:23:54,999
I'll see you at rehearsal tomorrow. Huh?

1324
01:23:57,172 --> 01:23:59,333
I'm not coming tomorrow.

1325
01:24:03,812 --> 01:24:05,712
What do you mean. You're not corning?

1326
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,040
I'm leaving the show.

1327
01:24:07,215 --> 01:24:09,513
Now. Wait a minute.
Stop your kidding. Will you?

1328
01:24:09,684 --> 01:24:12,016
I'm not joking. I'm afraid of it.

1329
01:24:12,187 --> 01:24:14,018
I don't think I can make good.

1330
01:24:14,189 --> 01:24:16,089
Even you didn't like
my rehearsals today.

1331
01:24:16,257 --> 01:24:19,556
Well. That's what rehearsals are for.
To improve your work.

1332
01:24:19,727 --> 01:24:22,525
Now. You haven't been listening
to Duffy out there. Have you?

1333
01:24:22,697 --> 01:24:26,724
No. I've been up in my dressing room.
Thinking this all out alone.

1334
01:24:26,901 --> 01:24:29,131
I really don't fit in here. Steve.

1335
01:24:29,304 --> 01:24:31,932
I belong with Star Gazer and Sonny.

1336
01:24:32,107 --> 01:24:34,337
- Sonny?
- Yes.

1337
01:24:34,509 --> 01:24:36,602
This isn't fair to him.

1338
01:24:36,911 --> 01:24:38,344
What do you owe Sonny?

1339
01:24:38,513 --> 01:24:40,606
He works for me for nothing.
Besides that...

1340
01:24:40,782 --> 01:24:42,909
...he gave me the money
to buy Star Gazer.

1341
01:24:43,084 --> 01:24:45,644
- He gave it to you?
- Yes. He did.

1342
01:24:46,955 --> 01:24:49,287
Oh. Yeah. That's right. He did. Didn't he?

1343
01:24:49,457 --> 01:24:51,584
Well. That's no reason
why you should leave me.

1344
01:24:51,759 --> 01:24:53,226
My show. I mean.

1345
01:24:53,394 --> 01:24:56,295
Believe me.
It will be much better without me.

1346
01:24:56,464 --> 01:24:58,193
Good night. Steve.

1347
