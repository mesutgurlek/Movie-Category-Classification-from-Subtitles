1
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,353
Face

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,992
- We're looking for Antoine.
- You just missed him.

3
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,109
I'll call him.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,353
His cup is still there.

5
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,433
You know where he went?

6
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,152
He should be in the park.

7
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,830
- He doesn't live far?
- Just above that street.

8
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,112
Antoine, it's Christophe,

9
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,629
the production
manager on Kang's film.

10
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,956
I thought we had
an appointment at the cafe.

11
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,791
We had an appointment at ten...

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,479
He's at the dentist.

13
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,110
He thought it was at nine.

14
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,995
Do you know
how long it will take?

15
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,190
You, you, you...

16
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,436
You are so pretty!

17
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,756
And I, and I, and I...

18
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,916
I am so happy!

19
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,075
Look

20
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,511
at the bees making honey

21
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,712
How couldn't I fall in love
with thee?

22
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,596
It is because

23
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,836
you are so pretty!

24
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,110
You bring

25
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,356
joy to my heart!

26
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,878
You are so pretty!

27
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,116
I am so happy, you're so pretty!

28
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,039
I am so happy, you're so pretty!

29
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,910
You, you, you...

30
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,111
You are so pretty!

31
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,436
And I, and I, and I...

32
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,631
I am so happy!

33
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,795
Look

34
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,197
at the bees making honey

35
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,437
How couldn't I fall in love
with thee?

36
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,310
It is because

37
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,511
you are so pretty!

38
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,870
You bring

39
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,071
joy to my heart!

40
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,592
You are so pretty!

41
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,836
I am so happy, you're so pretty!

42
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,554
I am so happy, you're so pretty!

43
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,830
Yes,

44
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,670
come...

45
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,313
Vincent, stop!

46
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,357
Don't you understand?

47
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,271
They are complete idiots...

48
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,950
Hello...

49
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,239
Why was Antoine on the set?.

50
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,910
He wasn't scheduled for today,
couldn't you warn him?

51
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,871
You should have written a call sheet
telling him not to come.

52
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,878
Antoine has to be protected,
don't you get it?

53
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,799
The insurance won't work,
what do I do?

54
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,434
Is he disfigured, is it serious?

55
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,914
Is he suffering?

56
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,598
I'm fed up with your tales!

57
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,439
On top of it I lost a shoe,

58
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,312
that I loved incredibly...

59
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,839
I won't find...

60
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,919
Where am I? In the Tuileries,

61
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,111
in the snow... nothing, no one.

62
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,312
No one answers, just a machine...

63
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,112
I found my shoe!

64
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,469
I found it.

65
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,509
You must speak to him,

66
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,188
you must be by his side.

67
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,198
You must take care of him.

68
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,714
Antoine is a fragile actor.

69
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,512
You must watch him.

70
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,677
You are no longer by my side,
my heart

71
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,069
There is but solitude in my soul,

72
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,233
and if I can see you no more

73
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,476
as God made me love you

74
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,240
to make me suffer more...

75
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,278
You were always my reason to eXist

76
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,236
To adore you was my religion,

77
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,560
and in your kisses I found

78
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,796
the warmth which honored

79
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,355
the love of passion

80
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:43,038
It's the story of a love as no other

81
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,671
It made me see the good and the bad

82
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,952
and brought light to my life

83
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,237
Only to turn it off later

84
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,315
How dark life is,

85
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,878
without your love, I won't live

86
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,709
Liao...

87
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,433
I want it

88
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,593
to be slightly

89
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,190
translucent.

90
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,358
I want her skin to be translucent.

91
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,040
So the veins are visible.

92
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,999
How shall we do that?.

93
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,518
Let me think...

94
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,597
Take some of her makeup off.

95
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,913
We can't see the skin's teXture.

96
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,353
The skin color will be more natural.

97
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,230
Vincent?

98
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,714
Ask Christophe

99
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,912
to take some makeup off her cheeks.

100
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,032
Can you remove

101
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,516
the makeup from her cheeks.

102
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,679
The eyes too?

103
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,075
What about the eyes?

104
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,510
Yes, the eyes too.

105
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,192
It doesn't look cold enough.

106
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,355
Could I have a hot tea please?

107
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,355
Thanks.

108
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,437
Give it to her later.

109
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,032
I'd like her skin to evoke...

110
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,355
Liao, on the picture, I'd like

111
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,393
her skin to evoke jade.

112
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,997
She is too made up.
The skin still appears warm.

113
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,153
It's not cold enough?

114
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,956
We might have to put ice.

115
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,919
That's better.

116
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,349
I don't understand.
Who disappeared?

117
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,273
How so, disappeared?

118
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,835
From where? To go where?

119
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,675
The mating period?

120
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,472
You're totally mad.

121
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,274
You're telling me
the deer disappeared?

122
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,072
And he is where, in Paris?

123
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,952
Trotting where, he's where?

124
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,918
It's not possible.

125
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,509
So what! The night is falling.

126
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,075
The deer is all alone.
What will he do?

127
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,316
You're all lined up behind him?

128
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,109
It's ridiculous.
We've wasted too much time.

129
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,754
Then send some to get him,

130
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,791
and in the meantime tell Kang

131
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,390
to shoot a scene in...

132
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,879
in the underground.

133
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,799
Then ask him.
And we'll turn it around,

134
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,434
and notwaste any time.

135
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,709
How so, with Antoine?

136
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,195
Everyone's behind the deer,
Kang with Antoine,

137
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,118
and no one on the set?

138
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,792
That's not possible,

139
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,069
then try to get Kang,
try to neutraliZe Antoine,

140
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,670
find the deer,
and stop wasting time.

141
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,037
What's the deer's name?

142
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,468
Then call him! Call him in the night!

143
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,671
You call him "ZiZou"
and he doesn't answer?

144
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,435
Yes.

145
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,475
Well yes. Why not.

146
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,151
It would be eXtraordinary.

147
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,116
I should have brought a book.

148
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,115
Hello.

149
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,194
You too were invited, it's good.

150
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,390
Yes.

151
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,789
And you know... the person?

152
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,594
It's better to trust strangers.

153
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,438
I don't know who organiZed this.

154
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,510
We're eXpecting a lot of people.

155
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,996
Seventeen persons now.

156
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,156
There are no servants either.

157
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,590
They'll come, they'll come.

158
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,795
There's a door there, in the shadow.

159
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,919
There's a dead animal.

160
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,598
Nathalie lost her earring.

161
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,189
I lost an earring.
All right Fanny?

162
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,352
Did you find it?

163
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,829
Avery pretty, small crab.

164
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,112
She's a Cancer,
she's very attached to it.

165
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,317
When the butler comes,
we'll send him under the table.

166
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,633
I went to the end.

167
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,634
It's a funny table, there's no one.

168
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,593
- Are you hungry?
- Pretty much.

169
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,917
We have a huge beast to eat.

170
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,597
If we talk, time will go by.

171
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,995
Shall we drink while waiting?

172
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,115
Well...

173
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,035
just a bit,

174
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,195
thanks.

175
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,154
And me, yes.

176
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,959
Let's toast.

177
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,679
To your loves.

178
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,076
Take it.

179
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,189
Titi is a great director.

180
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,999
Small...

181
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,350
and great bird.

182
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,949
The Lady from Shanghai...

183
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,951
Everyone is gone,

184
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,595
but Titi will stay

185
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,718
till the end.

186
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,233
It's in his character.

187
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,671
PutTiti in front,

188
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,552
in front of the picture.

189
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,678
PutTiti in front.

190
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:52,750
Flowers from the garden

191
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,999
at dusk are sullen,

192
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,953
but as the day rises

193
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:08,237
their gloominess dies

194
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,073
It's a trap!

195
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,954
All right?

196
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,398
Too many things here.

197
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,475
It's all gone bad.

198
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,714
Do we keep that?
