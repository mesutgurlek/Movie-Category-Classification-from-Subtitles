1
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:24,612
The Threepenny Opera had its film
premiere in Berlin on February 19, 1931.

2
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:27,987
It was restored in 2006
for the film's 75th anniversary

3
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:32,153
from the original negative
in the German Federal Film Archives.

4
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:57,049
You gents who
to a virtuous life would lead us

5
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:02,160
And turn us
from all wrongdoing and sin

6
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,494
First of all
see to it that you feed us

7
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:12,460
Then start your preaching
That's where to begin

8
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:15,368
THE THREEPENNY OPERA

9
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:19,576
All you who love your paunch
and our propriety

10
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:25,745
There's one thing
you must finally realize

11
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:30,820
No matter how you try
to twist and turn it

12
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:37,590
First comes the grub
Then you can moralize

13
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:44,095
There must first be a chance
for all now poorly fed

14
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,573
To get their slice

15
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:52,210
Of life's great loaf of bread

16
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,747
How does a man survive?

17
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:02,782
How does a man survive

18
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:06,454
By daily cheating

19
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,824
Mistreating, beating others
Spitting in their face

20
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,591
Only that man survives

21
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,834
Who's able to forget

22
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:23,365
That he's a member of

23
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:26,773
The human race

24
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:31,684
Gentlemen

25
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:36,254
This truth you cannot shirk

26
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,962
Man lives exclusively

27
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:48,601
By dirty work

28
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,408
Mackie!

29
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:36,402
The shark has teeth

30
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:41,140
There they are
for all to see

31
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:47,052
But the knife
that Macheath carries

32
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:52,049
No one knows
where it may be

33
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:58,020
On a blue
and balmy Sunday

34
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:02,668
On the strand
a mars lost his life

35
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:08,070
A man darts
round the corner

36
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:13,011
People call him
Mack the Knife

37
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,405
And Schmul Meier

38
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,948
Is still missing

39
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:24,146
One more wealthy man removed

40
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:30,190
Somehow Mackie
has his money

41
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:35,026
And yet nothing
can be proved

42
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:41,268
Jenny Towler was discovered

43
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:46,002
With a knife stuck in her chest

44
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:52,046
Mackie strolls
along the dockside

45
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:56,711
Knows no more
than all the rest

46
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:02,989
Seven children
and an old man

47
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:08,592
Burned alive in old Soho

48
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:14,605
In the crowd stands
Mack the Knife

49
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:19,972
Who's not asked
and doesn't know

50
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,845
And the widow
not yet twenty

51
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,283
She whose name

52
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,548
All could say

53
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:36,923
Defiled one night
as she lay sleeping

54
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:42,693
Mackie, what price did you pay

55
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:48,772
Defiled one night
as she lay sleeping

56
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:56,074
Mackie, what price did you pay

57
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:04,148
Excuse me, ladies.
Care to step inside for a drink?

58
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:39,083
I don't want to be
disturbed tonight.

59
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,923
Is Mackie inside?

60
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,290
- How about you and me, Jenny?
- Stop it!

61
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,190
Let the lady go.

62
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,426
Lady?
What lady?

63
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,104
You mean me?

64
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:10,503
Worry about your own wife!
She's gone off with another guy!

65
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,772
Say hi to Mackie for me.

66
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:12,468
The best dancer in Soho.

67
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,574
Places on the dance floor!

68
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,043
A full bridal outfit.

69
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,118
In brocade.

70
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,457
Orders from the captain.

71
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,237
He's getting married

72
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,315
this morning at 10 past 2:00

73
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,818
in warehouse number 3
in the shipyard on the Thames.

74
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,422
Bring the vicar.

75
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,589
A full bridal outfit in brocade.

76
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,862
Complete home furnishings:

77
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:29,091
A four-poster bed and rugs,
and don't forget a grandfather clock.

78
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,051
Deliver this.

79
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:59,931
Dress properly.
Don't show up looking like this.

80
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:09,507
I hope this is
the last time he gets married.

81
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,843
Deliver this.

82
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,653
Deliver this.

83
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,405
Deliver this.

84
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,344
MR. J. M. BROWN
CHIEF OF POLICE, LONDON

85
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,995
Grab it, will ya?

86
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,576
It's about time!

87
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,314
Confound it!

88
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,718
One burglary after another?

89
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,087
A burglary at Selfridge's?

90
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,388
Now that's something!

91
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:49,055
And nobody was caught?

92
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,536
They all got away?

93
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,503
Is that all you have
to report, gentlemen?

94
00:17:56,708 --> 00:18:00,075
You don't know me very well.

95
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,874
I'm not chief of London police
for nothing.

96
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,416
Ten burglaries every night
and no one's ever caught?

97
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,452
How can I uphold
law and order

98
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,682
if you let me down like this,
gentlemen?

99
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:19,359
When I think of the upcoming
coronation festivities, I could -

100
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,125
If the slightest thing
should go wrong -

101
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,301
Come in! - 

102
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:27,802
you'll see a side of me
you've never seen before -

103
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:32,405
What is it now?
- We caught a burglar red-handed.

104
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:38,478
You actually... caught a burglar?

105
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,948
You have him here?

106
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,120
Bring him in immediately!

107
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:50,591
Now, gentlemen,
I'll show you

108
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:55,130
how you deal
with a fellow like this.

109
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,212
Take your hat off.

110
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:29,432
You were caught red-handed.

111
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,796
You know

112
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:38,272
this will cost you
several years.

113
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:46,778
You know that in such cases
I am ruthless!

114
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,817
...that I am ruthless

115
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,554
and unwavering.

116
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,927
Unwavering.

117
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,494
What's that?

118
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:10,507
Leave me alone with this man,
gentlemen.

119
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:24,320
What have you -

120
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:46,103
Very well. You can go.

121
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,743
No, wait!

122
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,495
Hands up...
if anyone's there!

123
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,232
Is anyone there?

124
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,231
There's no one here.

125
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,370
We can hold the wedding here
safe enough.

126
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:26,727
- Bill Lawgen
- And Mary Syer

127
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:30,533
Last Wednesday
man and wife became

128
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:34,473
As they stood
side by side at city hall

129
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:38,115
He wondered
where she got the gown and all

130
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:42,946
While she wasrt
too sure of his name

131
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:58,134
You see the moon over Soho?

132
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,673
I see it, dearest.

133
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,538
Do you feel my heart beating,
my beloved?

134
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,083
I feel it, my darling.

135
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:19,713
Wherever you go,
I too shall go.

136
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,018
And wherever you are...

137
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:29,690
I want to be too

138
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:36,630
And though there's no license
from city hall

139
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:43,814
And no altar
covered with flowers fair

140
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:50,820
And though you may not know
where your gown came from

141
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:57,824
And there's no myrtle
in your hair

142
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:07,069
Take the plate
on which you eat your bread

143
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:12,742
Don't look at it for long
Fling it far

144
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:20,173
Love lasts forever

145
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:24,321
Or else not at all

146
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:31,526
No matter where we are

147
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,311
No, no.
Stay a while, Reverend.

148
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:04,954
Attention, everyone!

149
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,915
It's ten past 2:00!

150
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:41,455
Hip, hip, hurray!

151
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,382
- Congratulations, Polly.
- Congratulations, Captain.

152
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:08,415
Congratulations!

153
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,495
Well, you didn't make
much of an effort.

154
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,935
Champagne in wine glasses!

155
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:45,982
Junk!

156
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,096
It's lovely.

157
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,766
Is all this stolen too, Mackie?

158
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,769
Of course.

159
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:11,745
Pity we don't have our own place
for these nice things.

160
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,387
This is pathetic.

161
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,820
All Scotland Yard
was out and about.

162
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,989
And where's
the grandfather clock?

163
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,765
No grandfather clock?

164
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,467
Pathetic.

165
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:40,569
My wife is beside herself.
What bunglers!

166
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,847
I'm getting married for once.
How often does that happen?

167
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,812
Reverend!

168
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:50,282
I'm so happy
you could be here

169
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:53,685
on the happiest day
of our lives.

170
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,760
Reverend,
this is Miss Peachum,

171
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,866
who loves me and wishes
to share her life with me.

172
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,536
Congratulations, Polly!

173
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,744
Congratulations, Captain!

174
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,247
Reverend!

175
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,946
Wort you honor us
by staying?

176
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:33,020
I've got... a christening.

177
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:37,654
Hopefully we'll need you
for that pretty quick too.

178
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,064
Shut up!

179
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,859
No dirty jokes
in the presence of a lady.

180
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:50,868
And where's
that grandfather clock?

181
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,040
Where's the grandfather clock?

182
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,147
Accompany the reverend.

183
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,510
I do apologize, Reverend.

184
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,413
This area's not very safe.

185
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:15,594
This way, Vicar.

186
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:18,926
Careful.

187
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,534
Sorry.

188
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:06,413
I would have preferred it
if you hadrt all rushed to the trough.

189
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,684
We could have used
a little entertainment.

190
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,445
I'm hungry, Mackie.

191
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:15,114
Other people always manage that
on these occasions.

192
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,090
Will none of you oblige?

193
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:40,315
Is anyone watching at the door?
Must I see to everything myself?

194
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,888
Gentlemen...

195
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,457
if none of you will oblige,

196
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,118
I'll offer up
a little song myself.

197
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:19,147
I once thought
in my innocent youth

198
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:21,552
And I once was
as innocent as you

199
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:24,694
Perhaps I too
would have a suitor one day

200
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,493
Then I must know what to do

201
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,667
And if he's rich
and if he's nice

202
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:33,894
And if his collar
is white as snow

203
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:37,802
And if he knows
how to treat a lady

204
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,802
Then I shall tell him no

205
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:44,504
Then you hold your head up high

206
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:47,548
And don't let your feelings show

207
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,744
Sure, the moon
will shine all night

208
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:54,186
But the boat on the river
will stay tied up tight

209
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,728
That's as far as you can go

210
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:06,327
Oh, you can't simply lie back

211
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:13,405
You must be cold
and heartless as you know

212
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:19,983
Or else all sorts of things

213
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:24,018
Could happen

214
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:32,529
Yes, there's just one answer- no

215
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:41,631
The first to come along
was a man from Kent

216
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,774
He was all
that a man should be

217
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,536
The second had
three ships in the harbor

218
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:50,543
And the third
was mad about me

219
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:53,512
And they had money
and they were nice

220
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,619
And their collars
were white as snow

221
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:00,882
And they knew
how to treat a lady

222
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,720
So I had to tell them

223
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,122
No

224
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,490
I held my head up high

225
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:10,599
Didrt let my feelings show

226
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:13,634
Sure, the moon shone all night

227
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,807
But the boat on the river
stayed tied up tight

228
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:21,411
That's as far
as things could go

229
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:32,347
Oh, you can't simply lie back

230
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:39,027
You must be cold
and heartless as you know

231
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:47,760
Or else all sorts of things
could happen

232
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:55,804
Yes, there's just one answer

233
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:57,605
No

234
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:07,186
But then one day
when the sky was blue

235
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,951
Came a man
who didn't bother wooing

236
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,821
He tossed his hat
on the peg in my room

237
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:17,194
And I no longer knew
what I was doing

238
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,700
Since he had no money
and he wasrt nice

239
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:24,033
And his collar
wasrt white as snow

240
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:28,679
Since he didn't know
how to treat a lady

241
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:32,906
I couldn't tell him no

242
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:36,118
I no longer
held my head up high

243
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,084
And I let my feelings show

244
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,589
Oh, the moon
shone as before

245
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,523
But the boat cast loose
and drifted from the shore

246
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:51,032
That's just how it had to go

247
00:37:53,971 --> 00:38:02,003
Oh, then you must
simply lie back

248
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:09,815
Oh, you can't be
cold and heartless, you know

249
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:21,060
Oh, it simply had to happen

250
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:30,099
There was no such word as

251
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,277
No

252
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,476
Very nice!

253
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,552
Funny!

254
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:47,849
The missus
can sure sing a song!

255
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,186
Very nice!

256
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,486
It wasrt "nice," you idiots!

257
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,727
It's not nice, it's art!

258
00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:00,093
That was wonderful, Polly.

259
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:02,966
Too good for this trash.

260
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,908
Bad news!
It's the sheriff himself!

261
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,315
Hello, Jackie!

262
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,342
Hello... Mackie.

263
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:32,296
Dear old Mackie, couldn't you
have done this someplace else?

264
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:35,370
Did you have to take over
somebody's warehouse?

265
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:39,339
It's burglary, Mackie -
another burglary!

266
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:43,172
Jackie, I'm delighted you've come
to your old friend's wedding.

267
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,976
My pleasure, my pleasure.

268
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:50,517
My heartfelt congratulations
on this occasion.

269
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:54,521
Now don't be angry,
but I must get back to work.

270
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,352
Polly?

271
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,492
This is

272
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,460
Tiger Brown.

273
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:09,629
- Chief of London police.
- Mackie, please!

274
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:15,102
Where haven't we been together?
India, the Sudan, in a hundred battles.

275
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,638
This is Polly.

276
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,910
The former Miss Peachum.

277
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:26,317
Peachum?
Did you say Peachum?

278
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,324
Is this old Peachum's daughter?

279
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:36,330
You're making off
with old Peachum's daughter?

280
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,895
That takes courage!

281
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,162
Why courage?

282
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:46,036
She's the daughter
of Londors beggar king!

283
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:50,577
My dear lady,
it's been delightful,

284
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,511
but I must be going.

285
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:54,945
Good-bye.

286
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:56,915
Good-bye, Mr. Brown.

287
00:40:57,188 --> 00:41:00,180
Good-bye, Mackie.
I must get back to the office.

288
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:03,485
The queers coronation
is coming up,

289
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:08,461
and if anything goes wrong,
I'll be held responsible.

290
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:11,658
I shudder to think
what could happen to me,

291
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:14,633
so I must be going.

292
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,670
Just a moment.

293
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:22,067
Does Scotland Yard have
anything on me in their files?

294
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:23,746
On you?

295
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,640
Not a thing!
It's all taken care of.

296
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,319
Good-bye, Mackie.

297
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,013
What an awful ladder!

298
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:37,852
Perhaps next time you might
choose a nicer warehouse.

299
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,131
- So that was Tiger Brown?
- Yes.

300
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:48,036
We have connections
with the highest authorities.

301
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,217
Captain,
now comes the best part.

302
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:08,955
- What is it?
- Another little surprise.

303
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:15,463
Bill Lawgen and Mary Syer

304
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:20,965
Last Wednesday
man and wife became

305
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:24,340
Three cheers
for the happy couple!

306
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,806
As they stood
side by side at city hall

307
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:28,979
He wondered
where she got the gown and all

308
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:32,080
While she wasrt
too sure of his name

309
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:58,333
You've seen the courtship
and marriage of Polly Peachum.

310
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:02,141
Now I'll show you
the power of the beggar king,

311
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:05,414
or as he calls himself,

312
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:09,410
"the poorest man in London."

313
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:28,995
Anyone wishing to take up
a beggar's trade in London

314
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:35,042
must have a license from
Jonathan Jeremiah Peachum & Co.

315
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,007
Twenty schillings.

316
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,641
Ten, Mr. Peachum.

317
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:45,047
Twenty. And 50%/%
of your weekly earnings.

318
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,722
But Mr. Peachum...

319
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,758
I have nothing.

320
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,204
Mrs. Peachum!

321
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:18,119
Number 314.
Baker Street district.

322
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:22,013
Get him some clothes.
Outfit C.

323
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,128
Come along, shorty.

324
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,660
My earnings.

325
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,825
What are those?

326
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:05,195
The five basic types of misery
guaranteed to move the human heart

327
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:09,668
and induce in a man
that unnatural state

328
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:13,104
in which he willingly
parts with his money.

329
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,244
Outfit C.

330
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:23,614
- Can't I have Outfit A?
- No.

331
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:28,457
That's the young man of good family
who's seen better days.

332
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,761
But I've seen better days myself.

333
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:34,726
No one will believe
your real suffering.

334
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:38,390
Complain of a real stomachache
and you'll only annoy them.

335
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:41,730
Enough questions.
Just get dressed.

336
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,670
Please forgive me.

337
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,409
Hurry it up, shorty.

338
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:57,576
I can't stand here holding
your trousers till Christmas.

339
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:06,685
Next.

340
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:09,229
P-p-please,

341
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:13,870
I have money
for a new co-co-co -

342
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:15,595
Polly!

343
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,802
Tell Polly to come down
right away.

344
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:20,874
How many times have I told you

345
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:23,774
that a gentleman
must have freshly laundered rags?

346
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:28,941
Holes are to be burned in
and stains made with candle wax.

347
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:32,145
Those with means to pay
are entitled to a uniform

348
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:35,325
that ensures the pity
of their clients.

349
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:40,696
What's that?

350
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:42,923
Your share of my take.

351
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,129
- Is that all?
- With this stump?

352
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:50,067
I'm lodging a complaint!
This place is a pigsty,

353
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:53,368
and this is a lousy stump!

354
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:10,682
There, my friend.
Now you can go work for a living.

355
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,452
Mr. Peachum!

356
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:23,172
Thugs! Thieves!

357
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:26,973
Next, please.

358
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:32,275
...a new co-co-costume!

359
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:34,074
Where's Polly?

360
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:36,619
I'll get her myself!

361
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:40,956
Let her sleep!

362
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:44,355
- Sleep? At this hour?
- Dear God!

363
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:13,115
Polly didn't come home?

364
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:19,062
Good morning!

365
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:26,700
G-g-good...

366
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:29,268
m-m-morning!

367
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,100
What?

368
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:41,514
A cane
with an ivory handle?

369
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:44,848
Mack the Knife!

370
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:47,623
Dear God!

371
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:01,326
Good morning.

372
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:09,274
Crook's trollop!

373
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,743
Help me undress.

374
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:56,784
You'll divorce him!

375
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:01,192
I love him.
How can I divorce him?

376
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,633
I'll tan your behind!

377
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:10,934
It won't do any good.
Love is greater than a tanned behind.

378
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:28,823
That's what we get
for spoiling her

379
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:32,962
with dresses, hats, gloves,
and parasols!

380
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:38,123
Mack the Knife! My honest business
and a common crook!

381
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:40,735
Hanging him's the only solution.

382
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:44,338
Hanging him?
You and your ideas.

383
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,839
Turn him in to the police.

384
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,569
- I don't know where he is!
- I do.

385
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,872
Where?

386
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:53,982
With his whores
in Turnbridge Alley.

387
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:35,782
I'm very sorry,

388
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:39,251
but there's nothing
the police can do.

389
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:44,065
Really? There's nothing

390
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,825
the police can do?

391
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:51,203
Then what's going to happen to you
will be a horrible injustice.

392
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:57,270
Me?

393
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:00,482
How so?

394
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,887
How so?

395
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:16,424
If you don't catch
Mack the Knife and hang him,

396
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:22,503
there'll be a scandal at the queers
coronation that will cost you your job.

397
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:29,538
An army of filthy beggars
will march up to greet the queen.

398
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:34,172
When they gather before
the church by the thousands,

399
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:37,251
it won't be a festive sight.

400
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:40,283
They're not an attractive crowd.

401
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:46,055
Not an attractive crowd, eh?

402
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:51,223
Well, I'll have them run off!

403
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:53,368
I'll force them to -

404
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:56,903
How will it look
at the coronation

405
00:52:57,107 --> 00:53:01,601
if 2,000 poor cripples
must be beaten to the ground?

406
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:06,013
It will look very bad,
Mr. Brown.

407
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:11,412
A revolting sight.

408
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:18,959
You're... you're threatening me!

409
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:22,262
This is blackmail!

410
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:27,394
I'll have you taken away,
Mr. Peachum!

411
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:29,799
Where's my bell?

412
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:33,167
I'll call to have you taken away

413
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:39,804
if you're ever so impertinent...

414
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:42,482
again.

415
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:45,678
I'm no criminal.

416
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:50,384
I'm just a poor man, Mr. Brown.

417
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:56,799
Look here, Mr. Peachum:

418
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,629
We're all poor men here.

419
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:04,440
Come, my dear,
poor Mr. Peachum.

420
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:09,237
I'm sure you understand
you can only hang a man

421
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:11,846
if you have the man.

422
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:15,882
You can only arrest a man
if you have him.

423
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,919
I can tell you where he is.

424
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:22,853
A mother-in-law ought to know
where her son-in-law can be arrested.

425
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:25,789
With the ladies
in Turnbridge Alley.

426
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:28,361
The whores
in Turnbridge Alley!

427
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:30,459
What's that?

428
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:35,629
A man lives by his head

429
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:39,706
He needs a larger size

430
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:44,009
Just try it for yourself
Your head

431
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:48,014
Wort feed a pair of lice

432
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:52,585
You see, for this existence

433
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:55,781
Man is never sharp enough

434
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,423
Hence his weak resistance

435
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,963
To its tricks and bluff

436
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:07,867
So make your little plan

437
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:11,805
Yes, be a shining light

438
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:16,435
Then make yourself
a second plan

439
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,840
None will turn out right

440
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,476
You see, for this existence

441
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:27,851
There's no man
who's bad enough

442
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:32,423
Still it's nice to watch them

443
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:35,962
Trying to be tough

444
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,726
Sure, chase your bit of luck

445
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:44,166
But no need to run fast

446
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:48,071
Though men always race after it

447
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:52,112
Luck always runs last

448
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:56,479
You see, for this existence

449
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:59,951
Mars demands are just too tough

450
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:04,654
All his noisy striving

451
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,125
Is self-deluding guff

452
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,060
ltem No. 8.

453
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:16,095
Regarding the safes
on Oak Street...

454
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:21,376
only cash is to be taken.

455
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:23,542
No securities.

456
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:27,683
Yeah, we're not getting
involved in stock fraud.

457
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,250
Jimmy Two...

458
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:35,351
will take command
of the explosives convoy.

459
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:40,692
If he's bumped off, no great loss.
He doesn't bring much in anymore.

460
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,901
You're one to talk.
Just a minute.

461
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:54,901
Three, four, five gold watches
was your take this month.

462
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:57,506
Not much.

463
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,252
Item No. 9.

464
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:13,295
Time of the burglary:

465
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:18,191
8:30, during
the coronation celebration.

466
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:22,497
- Guards will all be at the ceremony.
- And all plastered.

467
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:24,673
The job's a cinch.

468
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:27,242
Mackie!

469
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:34,078
What's the matter?

470
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:38,653
- You must pack right away.
- Nonsense! What's the matter?

471
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:41,619
You must leave immediately!

472
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:50,228
I went to see Tiger Brown,
and my father was there too.

473
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:54,062
They plan to arrest you.
You must pack immediately!

474
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:57,501
Nonsense!
Come here, Polly.

475
00:57:57,707 --> 00:58:00,039
There's something
I'd rather do than pack.

476
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:02,143
No, Mackie. Not now.

477
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:06,247
Brown stood up for you at first,
but then he gave in.

478
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:10,010
Now he says to tell you -
- What?

479
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,888
There's nothing more
he can do for you.

480
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:18,390
Come now!
I can trust Brown implicitly.

481
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:20,722
Scotland Yard
has nothing on me.

482
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,364
Maybe they didn't yesterday,

483
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:27,161
but today they've suddenly got
a whole lot on you.

484
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:38,311
In Winchester

485
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:42,781
you seduced two sisters,
both of them minors.

486
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,620
They told me
they were over 30.

487
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:49,220
Both of them together.

488
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:53,462
Your father's a fine one.

489
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:57,724
Is this the thanks I get
for marrying his daughter?

490
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:03,102
Very well.

491
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:08,300
If I must go, you'll have
to take over running the business.

492
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:13,507
Gentlemen...

493
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:17,208
I must unfortunately
take a little trip.

494
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,615
Now, with the coronation
coming up?

495
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:23,019
Without you,
it's like soup without a spoon!

496
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:27,390
I'm therefore temporarily entrusting
management of the business

497
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:29,462
to my wife.

498
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:32,529
What? A woman?

499
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:35,561
What about the big bank job?

500
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:37,262
Shut your trap!

501
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:40,636
Now, if the bank job
goes well,

502
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:44,711
then it's no more
picking pockets and street muggings.

503
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:48,941
It's good-bye to Soho
and hello to the big city!

504
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,022
Good-bye, you poor fools.

505
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:03,858
Good-bye, Captain!

506
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:37,196
Mackie,
don't tear my heart out.

507
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:42,666
Stay here with me,
and let's be happy.

508
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:47,364
I'm tearing my own heart out,

509
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:49,477
because I must go away,

510
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:52,170
and no one knows
when I'll return.

511
01:00:57,053 --> 01:01:00,750
It lasted so short a time.

512
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:03,851
Is it over then?

513
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:09,661
Don't forget me, Mackie,
in foreign parts.

514
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:12,528
I won't forget you, Polly.

515
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:16,171
Kiss me, Polly.

516
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:30,045
And don't go
to those ladies in Turnbridge.

517
01:01:30,586 --> 01:01:32,577
I love only you.

518
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,547
Farewell, Polly.

519
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:37,792
Farewell, Mackie.

520
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:34,480
I'm in charge now.

521
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:50,326
Gentlemen...

522
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:55,095
I think our captain
can depart in full confidence.

523
01:02:57,406 --> 01:03:00,603
We'll pull off that job just fine,

524
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:04,268
won't we, gentlemen?

525
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:08,007
In first-class style.

526
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:11,620
Isn't that right...

527
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:13,778
gentlemen?

528
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:18,017
Well, it's not for me to say,
but I'm not sure

529
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:22,186
that at a time like this,
a woman is the right man.

530
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:28,798
Nothing personal, ma'am.

531
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:31,930
The swine!

532
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,875
You bet
it was nothing personal!

533
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:38,979
Or else the others
would have tanned your hide!

534
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:41,480
Right, gentlemen?

535
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:53,490
Nothing personal, of course.

536
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:56,529
She packs a punch,
believe me.

537
01:03:56,732 --> 01:04:01,431
Splendid! Our lady captain knows
how to find the right word!

538
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:04,470
Bravo, Polly!

539
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:09,241
From now on

540
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:13,347
we'll settle accounts
every Thursday, gentlemen.

541
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:15,543
Dismissed.

542
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:15,773
Jenny, there's someone
here to see you.

543
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:35,358
- Isn't that lovely!
- The queers coronation gown?

544
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:37,532
It cost 7,000 pounds.

545
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:42,237
Imagine the fine underwear
a queen can afford.

546
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:46,039
Why would a queen
need fine underwear anyway?

547
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:51,637
I wonder if Mackie
will come by today.

548
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:54,543
I don't think
he'll ever be back.

549
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:59,915
WANTED!
£100 REWARD FOR MACK THE KNIFE

550
01:06:13,769 --> 01:06:18,468
He took away my daughter.
Married her, he did!

551
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:20,402
Married her?

552
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:24,375
Last night.
Married her good and proper.

553
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:30,443
I see.

554
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:48,092
So if he comes here today,

555
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:51,364
will you signal
from the window?

556
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:20,331
Hey, there! My coffee!

557
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:29,141
I'll signal.

558
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:39,352
Good heavens, Mackie!
What are you doing here?

559
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:41,916
Quickly, now! Mon café!

560
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:45,423
- Havert you seen the wanted posters?
- Yes, I know.

561
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:47,721
But Thursday's my day here.

562
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:51,889
I can't let such trifles
disturb my routine.

563
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:57,098
Hello, Mackie.

564
01:07:57,706 --> 01:07:59,469
Congratulations

565
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:02,033
on your marriage.

566
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:06,043
Too bad you missed it.

567
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,279
It was A-1.

568
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:11,850
Jenny, come join us.

569
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:17,286
Yes, Jenny...

570
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:19,120
come on.

571
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:30,672
Jenny, read his palm!

572
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:36,803
Jenny, why that look?

573
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:39,776
Just good news, please.
Nothing bad.

574
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:44,752
Mackie...

575
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:49,757
when the coronation bells
ring at Westminster,

576
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:54,328
you'll be in a bad way.

577
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:07,235
My hat and cane.

578
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,009
I'm going.

579
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:18,012
My jacket!

580
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:31,790
- Stay, Mackie.
- Who knows when you'll be back.

581
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:37,234
You can count on it.

582
01:10:37,866 --> 01:10:40,300
Gents, you see me
washing the glasses

583
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:42,527
And making your beds
without squawking

584
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:45,036
And you tip me a penny
and I thank you well

585
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:48,074
And you see my dirty rags
in this ratty old hotel

586
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:53,613
And you don't know
to whom you're talking

587
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:56,682
But one day there'll be
a shout at the dock

588
01:10:56,885 --> 01:10:59,353
And they'll ask
"What was that shout?"

589
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:03,456
And they'll see me smiling
as I wash my glasses

590
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:07,425
And they'll ask
"What's she smiling about?"

591
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:10,827
And a ship

592
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:14,434
With eight sails

593
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:20,306
And 50 cannon

594
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:23,837
Will be at the quay

595
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:31,109
Gentlemen, your laughter
will quickly stop

596
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,050
As walls tumble down
everywhere

597
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:37,588
The third day will see
the town razed to the ground

598
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:41,229
Just one ratty old hotel
will survive safe and sound

599
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:47,835
And they'll ask
"Who's so special that lives there?"

600
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:51,604
And that night a cry will go up
around the hotel

601
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,901
Folks will ask
"Why was this hotel spared?"

602
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:58,671
And at dawn they'll see me
coming through the doorway

603
01:11:58,881 --> 01:12:02,977
And they'll say
"So she lived in there!"

604
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:06,579
And a ship

605
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:09,690
With eight sails

606
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:15,494
And 50 cannon

607
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:19,757
Will lay siege to the town

608
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:28,971
A hundred men will land
in the bright midday sun

609
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:32,545
And stealthily step
through the shadows

610
01:12:32,748 --> 01:12:36,411
They'll enter every doorway
Grab every man they see

611
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:40,179
And clap them in chains
and bring them to me

612
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:44,155
And ask me
"Which shall we kill?"

613
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,989
And ask me
"Which shall we kill?"

614
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:54,760
That noon
there'll be quiet in the harbor

615
01:12:54,970 --> 01:13:00,033
As they ask me
"Who is to die?"

616
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:05,871
And then they'll hear my reply

617
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:07,708
"All of 'em!"

618
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:12,717
And as each head falls
I'll say

619
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:14,918
"Hoppla!"

620
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:19,149
And the ship

621
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:24,494
With eight sails

622
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:31,198
And 50 cannon

623
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:37,944
Will vanish with me

624
01:13:57,099 --> 01:14:00,535
Jenny,
you remember the days

625
01:14:00,736 --> 01:14:03,864
before my star
rose over this town?

626
01:14:05,207 --> 01:14:07,698
Even though I'm now
Mack the Knife,

627
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:12,745
I'll never forget you, Jenny.

628
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:22,015
What more
can a gentleman say?

629
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:23,919
Nothing.

630
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:42,072
Mackie, you must flee!

631
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:44,245
You've been betrayed!

632
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:49,015
Is there still just one way
out of this rattrap?

633
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:59,189
Stop him!
He went out the window!

634
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:54,937
You were
in quite a hurry just now.

635
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:57,771
I hadrt yet had the pleasure.

636
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,246
Is there someone
waiting for you?

637
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:04,516
She can wait.

638
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:18,698
I live just over there.

639
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:28,669
What is it now?

640
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:32,406
Never mind! Come on!

641
01:17:55,904 --> 01:17:58,134
Peachum!

642
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:10,609
He got away!

643
01:18:11,486 --> 01:18:12,919
Got away?

644
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:14,816
His girls helped him escape!

645
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:18,286
His girls!

646
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:30,429
Brown is the "girl" in question.

647
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:35,701
Tiger Brown
let his friend get away.

648
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:44,583
Well, Mr. Brown
has "out-Browned" himself.

649
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:50,625
It's time we start thinking
about the coronation parade.

650
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:03,094
We only just met,
and you're already leaving.

651
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:07,768
Goes with the profession.
Busy, busy, busy.

652
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,535
- Come back soon.
- Of course.

653
01:19:39,808 --> 01:19:42,072
No long speeches.

654
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:44,376
Time is money.

655
01:19:45,147 --> 01:19:47,115
I'm all yours, gentlemen.

656
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:04,230
You've seen Mackie's
bold and reckless nature.

657
01:20:04,432 --> 01:20:06,423
I'll now show you how,

658
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:09,968
through a loving wife's
cleverness,

659
01:20:10,172 --> 01:20:15,235
things take a turn
that even you wouldn't expect.

660
01:20:28,056 --> 01:20:30,354
The gentlemen of the board.

661
01:21:13,602 --> 01:21:15,900
Gentlemen of the board...

662
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:21,273
one can rob a bank,
or one can...

663
01:21:21,476 --> 01:21:24,639
Use a bank to rob others.

664
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:28,976
...tread the path of a respectable
and law-abiding business...

665
01:21:30,118 --> 01:21:33,315
as my papa so often told me.

666
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:36,256
"Polly," he always said,

667
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:39,552
"Who'd be so stupid
as to be a burglar these days

668
01:21:39,761 --> 01:21:42,423
when we've got laws?"

669
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:44,258
And though my husband -

670
01:21:44,466 --> 01:21:47,333
I mean, our most esteemed
managing director -

671
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:51,062
must hide like a fugitive
in foreign parts,

672
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:54,401
I'm certain he would approve

673
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:57,009
of how we pulled this off!

674
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:03,407
We bought this quiet,
elegant little bank...

675
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:08,888
which will be more profitable
than finding a few puny safes -

676
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:10,648
To rifle.

677
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:14,185
Now we'll really
get down to business!

678
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:16,995
Gentlemen,

679
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:20,861
we will remain true
to this institutiors honorable tradition

680
01:22:21,069 --> 01:22:23,936
of building and consolidating

681
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:27,836
the confidence
of the pu-pu-public

682
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:33,447
through our integrity
and fiduciary trustwon'thiness.

683
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:36,378
Bravo! Excellent!

684
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:38,916
Thank you, gentlemen.

685
01:22:51,599 --> 01:22:57,094
I'd just like to add that our firm
can only employ top-quality people.

686
01:22:58,473 --> 01:23:01,874
Street muggings
and pickpocketing are for idiots!

687
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:04,878
Forget the romance
of the past!

688
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,207
Life begins in earnest now.

689
01:23:07,782 --> 01:23:12,116
Whoever can't rise to the challenge
will be terminated forthwith

690
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,311
without remuneration.

691
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:17,190
Good day, gentlemen.

692
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:25,895
You can learn
a thing or two from her.

693
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:39,310
This way, Mr. Brown.

694
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:47,751
Would you like to see him?
- No...

695
01:23:47,956 --> 01:23:49,753
for God's sake.

696
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:52,825
Handle it yourself, please.

697
01:23:53,928 --> 01:23:55,623
Smith...

698
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:58,432
give him something to eat.

699
01:23:59,968 --> 01:24:01,765
A decent meal.

700
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:06,200
Wine.

701
01:24:08,676 --> 01:24:10,303
Cigarettes too?

702
01:24:10,512 --> 01:24:12,707
Of course!

703
01:24:12,914 --> 01:24:16,611
Wait!
He only smokes cigars.

704
01:24:16,818 --> 01:24:20,549
Give him these.

705
01:24:20,955 --> 01:24:24,447
He won't have time
to smoke many more.

706
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:15,132
Hello, Mackie.

707
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:17,071
Hello, Smith.

708
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:20,480
Did Brown
have any news for me?

709
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:24,077
He's very distraught,

710
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:28,779
and just when
the coronation parade's coming up.

711
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:30,480
I say, Smith...

712
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:34,784
you couldn't find
any heavier handcuffs?

713
01:25:35,363 --> 01:25:37,524
With your kind permission,

714
01:25:37,732 --> 01:25:40,462
I'd like
a more comfortable pair.

715
01:25:40,668 --> 01:25:44,570
Well, we have them
in every price range,

716
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:47,332
from one guinea to ten.

717
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:51,602
All depends on how much
you wish to spend.

718
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:57,743
How much for none at all?

719
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:03,256
Fifty.

720
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:14,196
Thanks, Captain.

721
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:20,572
Now, what would you like
to eat, Captain?

722
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:23,500
What have you got
in the canteen?

723
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:26,578
No, no prison fare for you.

724
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:30,342
If you'd like, I'll get it from -

725
01:26:31,986 --> 01:26:34,045
My last supper, eh?

726
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:38,949
There, Captain.
Now you can move about freely again.

727
01:26:57,245 --> 01:26:59,611
That's for someone else,
Captain.

728
01:27:04,085 --> 01:27:09,079
So, Captain,
what would you like for dinner?

729
01:27:11,492 --> 01:27:14,791
Leave it to me if you'd like.

730
01:27:14,996 --> 01:27:18,591
The gentlemen here
have always been most satisfied.

731
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:50,258
DO NOT TURN
A DEAF EAR TO MISFORTUNE

732
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:53,434
Hello?
Yes, I'll send them right away.

733
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:56,331
- Group 3 is ready.
- Off you go!

734
01:28:10,718 --> 01:28:13,414
Filch speaking. Good.

735
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:15,213
The 10th district is ready.

736
01:28:15,423 --> 01:28:19,553
They're to join the fourth
at Nelsors Column at 8:00 a.m.

737
01:28:19,761 --> 01:28:23,959
But we've got real cripples.
How can we make it by 8:00?

738
01:28:24,165 --> 01:28:25,757
You must.

739
01:28:29,537 --> 01:28:33,098
VICTIM
OF MILITARY DESPOTISM

740
01:28:41,182 --> 01:28:44,879
The ugliest are to march
on the outside...

741
01:28:47,088 --> 01:28:52,082
so the noble gentlemen
will have a pretty sight to look at.

742
01:29:06,974 --> 01:29:09,465
The royal guard
is presenting arms.

743
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:11,702
Dawn is breaking.

744
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:19,149
They'll ride right over us!

745
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:21,322
You've got slingshots.

746
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:24,980
- What if they shoot?
- Gentlemen!

747
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:28,785
Gentlemen...

748
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:33,831
at this very moment,
1,432 of your colleagues

749
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:38,028
are marching to pay
their respects to the queen.

750
01:29:39,507 --> 01:29:42,943
You too wish to be part
of this splendid occasion,

751
01:29:43,144 --> 01:29:45,169
you poorest of the poor,

752
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:48,747
who'd long ago have perished
in the sewers of Turnbridge

753
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:53,250
if I hadrt spent
sleepless nights devising a way

754
01:29:53,454 --> 01:29:57,015
to wring a few pence
out of your poverty.

755
01:29:57,225 --> 01:30:00,854
For I've shown
that the rich of this world

756
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:05,556
have no qualms about causing misery
but can't bear the sight of it!

757
01:30:06,734 --> 01:30:09,168
They have hard hearts

758
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:11,964
but weak nerves.

759
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:15,604
Well, we won't spare
their nerves today!

760
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:19,712
By the thousands
we'll tear at their nerves,

761
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:23,680
for our rags
do not conceal our wounds!

762
01:30:25,553 --> 01:30:27,248
Gentlemen...

763
01:30:28,289 --> 01:30:30,382
do not be afraid!

764
01:30:30,591 --> 01:30:34,925
The queen will not allow cripples
to be attacked with bayonets!

765
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:39,290
Forward!

766
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,331
Stop, Peachum!

767
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:44,334
Mackie's become
a bank president!

768
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:52,671
Call your people back!

769
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,577
Our Polly's a guest of honor
in the stands.

770
01:30:57,752 --> 01:30:59,686
Leave it to me.

771
01:31:23,411 --> 01:31:25,345
Stop!

772
01:31:25,546 --> 01:31:28,606
Back!

773
01:31:29,584 --> 01:31:31,779
Stop where you are!

774
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:33,920
Back!

775
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:38,425
Stop! Go back!

776
01:31:39,093 --> 01:31:41,493
Back, all of you!

777
01:31:42,897 --> 01:31:47,266
Stop! Go back!

778
01:31:47,969 --> 01:31:50,699
Come to your senses!

779
01:31:54,075 --> 01:31:56,305
Listen to reason!

780
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:10,984
So make your little plan

781
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:14,184
Yes, be a shining light

782
01:32:14,829 --> 01:32:18,595
Then make yourself
a second plan

783
01:32:18,799 --> 01:32:22,257
None will turn out right

784
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:25,928
You see, for this existence

785
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:29,075
There's no man
who's bad enough

786
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:33,510
Still it's nice to watch them

787
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:36,274
Trying to be tough

788
01:32:38,352 --> 01:32:43,051
I repeat: We must have
the remaining £3,000 in cash now!

789
01:32:43,257 --> 01:32:45,191
Without fail!

790
01:32:45,526 --> 01:32:47,460
You understand?

791
01:32:57,305 --> 01:33:01,071
Nervous, gentlemen?
Well, I'm very calm.

792
01:33:01,275 --> 01:33:05,006
But Tiger Brown, our best friend,
had him arrested!

793
01:33:05,212 --> 01:33:07,806
That must mean something.

794
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:17,683
We must get £10,000 in bail
to the police chief.

795
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:19,519
I'll take it!

796
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:22,627
There's turmoil in the streets.

797
01:33:23,764 --> 01:33:27,894
That's why I'm giving it
to our bank's trustwon'thy servant.

798
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:38,143
It's 11:00.
Why aren't you at the stock exchange?

799
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:45,308
Stop!

800
01:33:46,954 --> 01:33:50,014
Turn back!

801
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:53,457
Listen to me!

802
01:33:53,794 --> 01:33:55,887
Stop!

803
01:33:56,998 --> 01:34:00,058
Using force is pointless!

804
01:34:02,103 --> 01:34:05,266
They'll shoot you down!

805
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:07,998
Listen to me!

806
01:34:08,209 --> 01:34:11,906
You're marching
to your own destruction!

807
01:34:25,626 --> 01:34:28,754
Out of the question!
No visitors allowed here!

808
01:34:28,963 --> 01:34:30,897
Smith, let me go in.

809
01:34:31,098 --> 01:34:34,966
Jenny, I can't be responsible
if anyone should see you.

810
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:37,967
Smith, darling,
I'll only be a second.

811
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:41,835
I have to see that despicable
scoundrel once more.

812
01:34:42,043 --> 01:34:46,503
Mackie and I were close once.
- I know -

813
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:50,411
Smith, sweetie,
you can come see me tonight.

814
01:34:54,555 --> 01:34:56,819
I really shouldn't!

815
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:08,301
This slut is all I need now.

816
01:35:08,502 --> 01:35:11,096
- Enjoy your meal, Captain.
- My meal?

817
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:16,138
No time
to put on your face, eh?

818
01:35:16,343 --> 01:35:18,868
You dirty skunk!

819
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:23,380
How can you even look at me,
after all that's happened!

820
01:35:23,584 --> 01:35:24,812
Quiet, you stupid hussy!

821
01:35:25,019 --> 01:35:29,615
Monster! Think I don't know
about Suky Tawdry?

822
01:35:29,824 --> 01:35:31,655
Dinner's served, Captain.

823
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:36,727
Stop that now!
You'll drive the man crazy!

824
01:35:36,931 --> 01:35:40,799
Ah, Smith, my darling,
I love you so.

825
01:35:41,001 --> 01:35:46,132
I'd rather see him on the gallows
than in the arms of another.

826
01:35:46,674 --> 01:35:50,303
Oh, Smith,
you're such a darling,

827
01:35:50,511 --> 01:35:52,502
such a fine, upstanding man.

828
01:36:02,857 --> 01:36:04,324
Jenny, let go!

829
01:36:04,525 --> 01:36:06,993
No, I won't!

830
01:36:14,902 --> 01:36:16,563
So long!

831
01:36:17,138 --> 01:36:19,072
Let me go!

832
01:36:42,229 --> 01:36:45,721
GIVE AND
THOU SHALT RECEIVE

833
01:37:00,915 --> 01:37:03,850
More than 300 beggars
are marching towards Piccadilly.

834
01:37:04,051 --> 01:37:05,678
Disperse them!

835
01:37:06,821 --> 01:37:09,619
They broke through
the barrier at Baker Street.

836
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:12,793
The processiors been
completely obstructed.

837
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:16,485
- Arrest them!
- Arrest them all!

838
01:37:16,697 --> 01:37:20,428
Disperse them!
Use clubs if necessary!

839
01:37:20,634 --> 01:37:23,831
Use your clubs!
That's right!

840
01:37:24,038 --> 01:37:25,630
No, you idiot!

841
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:29,332
They can't club thousands
of beggars to the ground -

842
01:37:29,543 --> 01:37:32,068
and on Coronation Day!

843
01:37:32,279 --> 01:37:35,510
You can't be serious!

844
01:37:35,716 --> 01:37:39,311
- What do you want?
- I have bail for Mack the Knife.

845
01:37:40,054 --> 01:37:42,989
What's that?
What do you have?

846
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:44,748
Bail.

847
01:37:45,993 --> 01:37:47,654
For Mack the Knife.

848
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:51,423
Mackie?
I mean, Mack the Knife?

849
01:37:53,667 --> 01:37:55,134
Just a moment.

850
01:37:55,836 --> 01:37:57,531
Out of my way.

851
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:02,871
Hello?
Get me Division C, now!

852
01:38:03,077 --> 01:38:05,170
Hello?
Brown speaking.

853
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:08,576
Mack the Knife
is to be released immediately.

854
01:38:09,483 --> 01:38:10,973
What?

855
01:38:11,819 --> 01:38:15,585
Mack... has...

856
01:38:16,523 --> 01:38:18,991
escaped?

857
01:38:19,193 --> 01:38:20,660
Wait!

858
01:38:22,263 --> 01:38:25,232
Now you can go.
Confiscated goods.

859
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:40,913
Going to the coronation, Captain?

860
01:38:41,115 --> 01:38:44,175
Shut your trap!
I just busted out of jail!

861
01:38:44,385 --> 01:38:46,717
Busted out?

862
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:50,823
We sent over bail
from City Bank for you, our director.

863
01:38:51,025 --> 01:38:52,822
Bail?

864
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:55,285
For me?

865
01:38:55,496 --> 01:38:57,930
I just told you I busted out!

866
01:38:58,132 --> 01:38:59,622
Really?

867
01:38:59,833 --> 01:39:03,667
Good God!
£10,000 shot to hell!

868
01:39:03,871 --> 01:39:07,830
Pipe down! What filthy Soho sewer
is my office in now?

869
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:10,272
What Soho sewer?

870
01:39:10,477 --> 01:39:13,071
City Bank! Piccadilly!
Best part of town!

871
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,510
What? Piccadilly?

872
01:39:15,716 --> 01:39:18,742
City Bank? A real bank?

873
01:39:19,887 --> 01:39:23,448
Yes, sir!
An honest-to-goodness bank!

874
01:39:23,657 --> 01:39:26,285
Take the first right,
then the third left.

875
01:39:26,493 --> 01:39:29,792
If you see cops,
keep to the left!

876
01:39:29,997 --> 01:39:32,056
No, not right! Left!

877
01:42:24,371 --> 01:42:27,807
I was so worried about you.

878
01:42:28,008 --> 01:42:31,705
They were all after you
like bloodhounds.

879
01:42:32,412 --> 01:42:36,542
Did you remember
to pretty yourself up every day

880
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:39,742
just as if I'd been here?

881
01:42:40,254 --> 01:42:43,951
All I see are your lips.

882
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:47,753
I don't hear a word
you're saying.

883
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:51,423
Were you faithful to me too?

884
01:42:51,832 --> 01:42:56,667
You're looking good, Polly.
I'm very pleased with you.

885
01:42:57,938 --> 01:43:00,031
Have you seen the mail yet?

886
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:03,403
Mackie,
don't talk business now.

887
01:43:03,610 --> 01:43:05,908
Kiss your little Polly

888
01:43:06,113 --> 01:43:10,243
and swear
that you'll never, ever -

889
01:43:10,450 --> 01:43:12,611
We'd better get dressed.

890
01:43:12,819 --> 01:43:15,344
The coronation celebrations
have begun.

891
01:43:15,822 --> 01:43:17,585
The police barrier's broken!

892
01:43:17,791 --> 01:43:19,918
The coronation parade's
breaking up!

893
01:43:20,127 --> 01:43:22,118
Crowds of beggars
at Westminster!

894
01:43:22,329 --> 01:43:24,593
Pull the shades!

895
01:44:23,890 --> 01:44:25,858
Hello? Anyone here?

896
01:44:34,835 --> 01:44:38,134
Mackie, I'm ruined.

897
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:42,507
What a scandal!
I'll be sacked!

898
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:46,805
My days as police chief
are over!

899
01:44:51,918 --> 01:44:54,546
Don't worry.
You've come to the right place.

900
01:44:54,755 --> 01:44:56,916
You'll make
a great bank director.

901
01:44:57,124 --> 01:44:59,888
How much capital
would you like to invest?

902
01:45:00,394 --> 01:45:02,089
Capital?

903
01:45:03,096 --> 01:45:04,757
£10,000!

904
01:45:10,003 --> 01:45:13,996
His bail.
I salvaged it.

905
01:45:14,207 --> 01:45:17,370
Hear that, nitwits?
There's a lesson there.

906
01:45:17,744 --> 01:45:19,507
Come on.

907
01:45:19,713 --> 01:45:22,477
Come along,
you old battleship.

908
01:45:22,683 --> 01:45:25,117
Full steam ahead
for my whiskey bottle.

909
01:45:27,688 --> 01:45:29,178
Polly...

910
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:31,482
gentlemen...

911
01:45:33,627 --> 01:45:35,822
before you stands a man

912
01:45:36,029 --> 01:45:38,930
whom the king,
in his unfathomable wisdom,

913
01:45:39,132 --> 01:45:41,692
elevated high
above his fellow men.

914
01:45:42,803 --> 01:45:45,931
And yet this man remained
my friend through every storm,

915
01:45:46,139 --> 01:45:48,073
and so forth and so on.

916
01:45:52,579 --> 01:45:55,571
But fate moves
in mysterious ways.

917
01:45:55,782 --> 01:45:58,080
You all know what I mean.

918
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:02,587
Today this man
comes to me, Mack the Knife,

919
01:46:02,789 --> 01:46:05,724
as one friend to another.

920
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,152
There's a lesson there.

921
01:46:11,231 --> 01:46:14,564
Do you remember

922
01:46:14,768 --> 01:46:17,760
when you and I were soldiers

923
01:46:17,971 --> 01:46:20,701
and served
in the army in India?

924
01:46:20,907 --> 01:46:23,774
Yes, Jackie.
Those were the days!

925
01:46:32,252 --> 01:46:34,117
John was there and Jim was too

926
01:46:34,321 --> 01:46:36,312
And Georgie made sergeant
in short order

927
01:46:36,523 --> 01:46:38,184
The army doesn't give a fig
who you are

928
01:46:38,392 --> 01:46:40,792
And they marched us north
to the border

929
01:46:40,994 --> 01:46:45,328
Soldiers live under
the cannors thunder

930
01:46:45,532 --> 01:46:49,263
From the Cape to Cooch Behar

931
01:46:49,469 --> 01:46:51,460
If it should rain one night

932
01:46:51,671 --> 01:46:53,298
And they should chance to sight

933
01:46:53,507 --> 01:46:57,170
- An unfamiliar race
- Dark or fair of face

934
01:46:57,377 --> 01:47:01,438
They might just chop them up
to make their steak tartare

935
01:47:09,156 --> 01:47:13,183
- Johnny's whiskey was too warm
- And Jimmy thought he'd freeze

936
01:47:13,393 --> 01:47:17,727
- Georgie took them by the arm
- Saying, "Don't desert us, please"

937
01:47:17,931 --> 01:47:22,391
Soldiers live under
the cannors thunder

938
01:47:22,602 --> 01:47:26,333
From the Cape to Cooch Behar

939
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:28,337
If it should rain one night

940
01:47:28,642 --> 01:47:30,439
And they should chance to sight

941
01:47:30,644 --> 01:47:34,239
- An unfamiliar race
- Dark or fair of face

942
01:47:34,448 --> 01:47:38,509
They just might chop them up
to make their steak tartare

943
01:47:46,326 --> 01:47:48,191
John is buried and Jimmy's dead

944
01:47:48,395 --> 01:47:50,454
And they shot
poor Georgie for looting

945
01:47:50,664 --> 01:47:52,325
But blood is still blood-red

946
01:47:52,532 --> 01:47:55,194
And the army's still recruiting

947
01:47:55,902 --> 01:48:01,602
Soldiers live under
the cannors thunder

948
01:48:01,808 --> 01:48:05,175
From the Cape to Cooch Behar

949
01:48:05,979 --> 01:48:07,913
If it should rain one night

950
01:48:08,114 --> 01:48:09,775
And they should chance to sight

951
01:48:09,983 --> 01:48:11,848
An unfamiliar race

952
01:48:12,052 --> 01:48:13,679
Dark or fair of face

953
01:48:13,887 --> 01:48:18,517
They might just chop them up
to make their steak tartare

954
01:48:21,528 --> 01:48:26,329
The poorest man in London
and the wealthy Mack the Knife -

955
01:48:27,067 --> 01:48:30,036
shouldn't they join forces?

956
01:48:31,771 --> 01:48:36,799
The poorest man in London
is now bankrupt, my dear Peachum,

957
01:48:37,077 --> 01:48:39,739
and is just another poor devil.

958
01:48:39,946 --> 01:48:45,248
Today of all days showed me
the power of the poor.

959
01:48:50,056 --> 01:48:55,016
With your money and my experience,
we can do business,

960
01:48:55,228 --> 01:48:58,561
more business
than you could ever imagine.

961
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:05,334
If the poor are so powerful,
why do they need us?

962
01:49:05,539 --> 01:49:08,804
Because they don't know
that we need them.

963
01:49:10,277 --> 01:49:16,477
Gathered for the happy ending

964
01:49:17,183 --> 01:49:22,382
All and sundry pool their might

965
01:49:23,590 --> 01:49:29,290
When the needed funds are handy

966
01:49:29,996 --> 01:49:35,559
Things will usually turn out right

967
01:49:36,536 --> 01:49:42,202
Though a man
will fight his rival

968
01:49:42,943 --> 01:49:48,438
To fish the muddy depths

969
01:49:49,449 --> 01:49:55,251
In the end
they'll dine together

970
01:49:55,822 --> 01:50:01,260
And consume
the poor mars bread

971
01:50:02,662 --> 01:50:08,931
For some men
live in darkness

972
01:50:09,769 --> 01:50:15,503
While others stand in the light

973
01:50:16,977 --> 01:50:23,746
We see those in the light

974
