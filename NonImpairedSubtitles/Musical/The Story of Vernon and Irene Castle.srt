1
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,262
41 st Street.

2
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,406
Here, son.

3
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,043
- Castle?
- That's right.

4
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:31,547
$9.50.

5
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,710
- Cash.
- Oh, cash.

6
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,412
Wait a minute.

7
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,626
Mr. Fields, can I trouble you for $ 10
advance on my next week's salary.

8
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:45,423
You'll never have a next week's salary.
You already spent it last week.

9
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,329
Mr. Fields, if my next week's salary can
make a beautiful lady happy this week...

10
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,470
...it's my duty to spend it. Thanks.

11
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,833
- Here you are. Keep the change.
- Oh, thanks.

12
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:58,967
Say, Vernon, if those flowers
are for Miss Ford, you're aiming too high.

13
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:02,876
- We're having supper after the show.
- But you haven't got the right ammunition.

14
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,415
- The what?
- Spondoodles, mazuma.

15
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,746
Something that you second comics
never have.

16
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,412
But someday I'll be the first comic,
after you.

17
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,785
- Thanks.
- I'm sure you're wrong about Miss Ford.

18
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,928
A lot of fellas have been wrong
about Miss Ford. And you're next.

19
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,689
Look out.
She trifles with men's hearts.

20
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,993
Let her trifle with mine.
I'm not doing anything important with it.

21
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,892
- Addie.
- Yes, Miss Ford.

22
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,470
Be ready to dress me immediately
after the finale.

23
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,836
I'm having supper at Rector's
with Mr. Vanderpool.

24
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,405
Miss Ford.

25
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,603
- You're on next Mr. Castle.
- All right, John.

26
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,509
- Will you wear this tonight?
- Tonight?

27
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,412
- Remember our supper date.
- Oh, of course, I remember.

28
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:42,646
But my head is splitting and I should be in
bed this minute. You'll forgive me, darling.

29
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,449
- How about tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?

30
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:48,190
Sunday. Well, I'm going to the beach
at New Rochelle with my mother.

31
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,421
- Suppose I meet you at the club house?
- Oh, dear, well...

32
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,227
...if it's all right with Mother.
I'm so sorry about tonight.

33
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,539
Well, what did I tell you?

34
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:07,304
Mr. Fields, could you bag me
for a round trip ticket to New Rochelle.

35
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:14,177
<i>By the sea, by the sea</i>
<i>By the beautiful sea</i>

36
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:18,916
<i>You and I, you and I
<i>Oh, how happy we'll be</i>

37
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,459
<i>When each wave comes a-rolling in</i>

38
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,460
<i>We will duck or swim</i>

39
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,099
<i>And we'll float</i>
<i>And fool around the water</i>

40
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,634
<i>Over and under</i>
<i>And then up for air</i>

41
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:35,297
<i>Pa is rich, Ma is rich</i>
<i>So now why do we care?</i>

42
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,603
<i>I love to be beside your side</i>
<i>Beside the sea</i>

43
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,941
<i>Beside the seaside</i>
<i>By the beautiful sea</i>

44
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,878
Hello, pup. Who are you?

45
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,449
Well.

46
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,860
Mr. Castle. Mr. Castle.

47
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,388
Yes. Over here.

48
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,895
- You waiting for Miss Ford?
- Miss Claire Ford, yes.

49
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:03,695
She just phoned. Said,
tell Mr. Castle her head was still splitting.

50
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,334
Oh, I see.

51
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,972
It's too bad.

52
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,768
Lots of other ladies
sitting around here, Mr. Castle.

53
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,672
I dare say. Thanks.

54
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,747
- Have you seen a dog around here?
- Yes. Where is he?

55
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,824
Who is that fella?

56
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,825
Come on, there.
Get up you.

57
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,733
Oh, you poor little thing.

58
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,369
- Walter.
- I'm coming, Sailor.

59
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,698
- Isn't he your dog?
- Isn't he yours?

60
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,898
I never saw him until a moment ago.

61
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,838
Well, it must belong to somebody.

62
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,841
Walter, take the dog into the boat.

63
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,310
Well, I don't like the look of this,
Miss Irene.

64
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,474
- Take the dog.
- Drowning that dog to get acquainted.

65
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,846
Some of these whippersnappers
go pretty far.

66
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,352
- I beg your pardon.
- Don't mind Walter.

67
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:31,854
- You all right?
- Yes.

68
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,651
Climb in.

69
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,723
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

70
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,123
Goodbye.

71
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,389
Walter, let the gentleman into the boat.

72
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,965
That's exactly
what you want to do, ain't it?

73
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,695
No, no.
I'm quite comfortable, thank you.

74
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,264
Oh, please get in.

75
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,481
Thank you very much.

76
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,084
You are wonderful to jump in
to rescue a little stray dog.

77
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,592
- I'm very keen on dogs.
- Me too.

78
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,027
I keep a sort of boarding house
for wandering dogs in my dressing room.

79
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,133
- Dressing room?
- Yes, in the theatre.

80
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,166
In the theatre?

81
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,165
- Are you an actor?
- Well, yes.

82
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,807
- You're not the only actor in this boat.
- Do you act?

83
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,567
Me? No, I just work for the family.

84
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,910
- You?
- Hi.

85
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:28,813
She's a genius.

86
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:34,743
Walter practically raised me
and he's sort of prejudice.

87
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,889
What show are you with?

88
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:40,514
She played the fairy queen in Miss Dodd's
Seminary's Annual Entertainment.

89
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,321
- Oh, amateur shows.
- Dances like a sun beam.

90
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,727
What's your name?

91
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,924
- My name's Castle.
- My name's Foote.

92
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:52,002
My name will be mud when I try
to explain this to your mother.

93
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,171
- Why don't you start the motor?
- Because it's broke, that's why.

94
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,140
- Looks all right.
- Looks broke.

95
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,348
Irene was just 3, then.
Don't you love the flowers?

96
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,993
- And this is when she was 7.
- Very fetching.

97
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:19,461
The next one is <i>Pinafore.</i> Being English
yourself, Mr. Castle, I know you'll like it.

98
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:23,432
She was in a school production when
she was 10. Do you remember, Hubert?

99
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,969
- Oh, yes.
- Well, here's our dog.

100
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,470
- Our dog?
- I asked all around the neighborhood...

101
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,075
...and nobody claims him,
so Sailor wants to keep it.

102
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:34,077
- Well, he's very sweet.
- Here boy. Here boy.

103
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,738
- What train you figure on making?
- The 5:30.

104
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,009
I figure the 4:30.

105
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,611
Oh, look.

106
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,546
How nice.

107
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,817
Irene's going to do
a rendition for you.

108
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,888
- For me?
- Yes.

109
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:52,258
She's never had a chance to do
it for a professional audience before.

110
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,831
I think I'll go out
and work in the garden a bit.

111
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,526
Hubert, you stay right here.

112
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,601
I think my clothes must be dry by now.

113
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,743
You sit here, sir.

114
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,853
Ladies and gentlemen,
an imitation of Miss Bessie McCoy...

115
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:22,426
...doing her famous number,
"The Yama Yama Man." Thank you.

116
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:25,263
Mr. Castle, she may be
a little nervous.

117
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,898
I'm a little nervous myself.

118
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,184
<i>Every little tot at night</i>

119
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:52,256
<i>Is afraid of the dark, you know</i>

120
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,861
<i>Some big Yama Man they sing</i>

121
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:01,329
<i>As off to bed they go</i>

122
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:05,831
<i>Yama Yama Yama Man</i>

123
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:10,231
<i>Terrible eyes and a face of tan</i>

124
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,001
<i>If you don't watch out</i>

125
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:18,447
<i>He will sting you</i>
<i>Without a doubt, if he can</i>

126
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:23,016
<i>Maybe he's hiding behind the chair</i>

127
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:26,955
<i>Ready to spring out at you unaware</i>

128
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,993
<i>So run to your mama for here comes</i>

129
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:35,395
<i>The Yama Yama Yama Man</i>

130
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,280
<i>Bravo.</i>

131
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,720
- You did very nicely, dear.
- Thank you.

132
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,954
- Well, sir?
- That was fine.

133
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,593
Yes, sir that certainly was fine.

134
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:36,989
Thanks very much.

135
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,697
Do you really mean it
or you're just saying it?

136
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:46,167
No, really, I mean, you gave it quite
a professional touch... here and there.

137
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,737
Here and there?

138
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,432
I mean everywhere.
It was very nice.

139
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:53,271
Now, if you'll excuse me,
you see my train...

140
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,276
Oh, I see.

141
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,975
I'm sorry, I wish I can stay
and see it again.

142
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,245
- But I'm afraid...
- You afraid to see it again?

143
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,412
- Not at all.
- You don't wanna see it again?

144
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,854
- What the young man means is that...
- Hubert...

145
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,961
...let Mr. Castle decide.
- I would like to, but I must go.

146
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,859
- You'd like to see it again?
- Walter, he didn't say that.

147
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,624
- The man said...
- No, he didn't.

148
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,792
- I'd like to see it again, except my train...
- No trouble at all.

149
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,097
Now Walter,
not unless Mr. Castle wants to.

150
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,240
- I knew he didn't.
- I do.

151
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,739
Well, all right.

152
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:33,082
There's a possibility
you may catch the 8:15.

153
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:44,259
I understand every one of your criticisms,
except for one you sort of mumble.

154
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,761
Oh, that one.

155
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,196
- What does "ham" mean?
- That's just an expression.

156
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:50,665
Well, what does it mean?

157
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,737
In the theater we speak
of certain actors as hams.

158
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,397
Well, that makes me feel
so professional.

159
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,135
- Am I a real ham?
- Well, yes you're a little ham.

160
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,404
Oh, wonderful.

161
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,281
And after the way we ran.

162
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,622
<i>Come Josephine</i>
<i>In my flying machine</i>

163
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:18,993
<i>Going up all on</i>
<i>Goodbye</i>

164
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,861
<i>Come Josephine</i>
<i>In my flying machine</i>

165
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,629
<i>Going up she goes</i>
<i>Up she goes</i>

166
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,603
<i>Balance yourself like</i>
<i>A bird on a beam</i>

167
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:32,505
<i>In the air she goes</i>
<i>There she goes</i>

168
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,875
<i>Up, up a little bit higher</i>

169
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,581
<i>Oh, my moon is on fire</i>

170
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,448
<i>Come Josephine</i>
<i>In my flying machine</i>

171
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,384
<i>Going up</i>
<i>All on</i>

172
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,923
<i>Goodbye</i>

173
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,526
- Come on.
- Come on.

174
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:17,946
Go it, Vernon.

175
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,528
You didn't tell me
you can dance like that.

176
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,230
- You're marvelous.
- Thanks.

177
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,079
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

178
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:55,016
All aboard. Go ahead, kiss her.
Next Sunday is a long way off.

179
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,348
Next Sunday? Oh, yeah.

180
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,458
All aboard.
Hurry up, bashful.

181
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,674
<i>Oh, you beautiful doll</i>
<i>You great big beautiful doll</i>

182
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:24,680
<i>Let me put my arms about you</i>
<i>I could never live without you</i>

183
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:30,049
<i>Oh, you beautiful doll</i>
<i>You great big beautiful doll</i>

184
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:33,020
<i>If you ever leave me</i>
<i>How my heart would ache</i>

185
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:36,218
<i>I want to hug you</i>
<i>But I fear you'd break</i>

186
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:42,300
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>
<i>Oh, you beautiful doll</i>

187
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,006
- Oh, Irene, I can hardly wait.
- Does he dance soon?

188
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,335
Oh, here he is.

189
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,469
You see he's in the next scene
and he plays with the star.

190
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:58,241
The Barber Lew Fields
The Customer Vernon Castle.

191
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,442
- My aunt once knew an opera singer.
- Did she?

192
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,883
- Wait till you see Vernon dance.
- Isn't it wicked?

193
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,489
I mean knowing an actor.

194
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,535
- He's coming down the stairs now.
- Are you sure?

195
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,364
Leave him to me.
Leave him to me.

196
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,564
I'll show him
for insulting my daughter.

197
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,176
- Say something.
- L...

198
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,688
That's real ham comedy.

199
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,824
- What did you say?
- Ham.

200
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,017
- Where?
- You're looking at two of the best...

201
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,321
...right down there.

202
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,796
- Done it again, Vernon.
- Yeah.

203
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,066
- You were great today, Vernon.
- Oh, thanks.

204
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,233
Thanks very much.

205
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:42,980
Oh, hello.

206
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,747
Have you been out front?

207
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,653
How did you like it?

208
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,314
You were terrible.

209
00:19:57,062 --> 00:20:00,691
Oh, so Ms. Irene Foote... actress
of New Rochelle... thinks I'm terrible.

210
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,926
Thanks for taking the trouble
to come back and tell me so.

211
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:07,265
You could be a perfectly wonderful
dancer if you wanted to.

212
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,670
Instead you waste your talent
letting people set fire to you.

213
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:14,278
It takes talent to make people laugh.
And I like being set fire to.

214
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:18,246
- Well, I won't have you doing it.
- Oh, you won't.

215
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,282
Say, what makes you
so excited about me?

216
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:26,186
You have something no comedian
will ever have and you're wasting it.

217
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,389
What other reason could there be?

218
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:34,692
Oh, I don't know. Girls, especially young
girls, sometimes gets crushes on actors...

219
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,096
- Oh, I didn't...
- You called me a ham.

220
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:43,071
Well, you're a ham with mustard.
Oh, I know what it means.

221
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,439
And if you think I had interest
in coming back here, you're mistaken.

222
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,439
- Wait.
- Don't think I'll annoy you...

223
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:52,778
...with my intentions, Mr. Castle. Just go
on, be funny with soap on your face...

224
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,044
...and get to be a first comedian.

225
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,678
I thought you could be a first dancer.
A very beautiful first dancer.

226
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:02,987
Because you are a beautiful dancer,
but you're so smug and conceited...

227
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,721
...that you can't see any further
than your funny nose.

228
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,364
There!

229
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,514
Was you expecting someone, Sailor?

230
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:36,760
Can't a person sit in their own front yard
on a Sunday without expecting somebody.

231
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,793
I knew he's a fly-by-night.

232
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,057
I knew it the minute I seen him.

233
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:44,691
- Who?
- The fellow you're not expecting.

234
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,751
Hello there.

235
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,859
Is Ms. Foote at home?

236
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,722
She's not?

237
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:18,497
Did she go out?

238
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,533
Come on, Zowie.
Come on, Zowie.

239
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,802
Come on, Zowie. Come on.
That's it.

240
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:28,411
- My, it's getting warm, isn't it, Walter?
- Hello.

241
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,048
Oh, hello, Mr. Castle.

242
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:40,784
I just happened to be out this way,
so I stopped by to see if the dog is all right.

243
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:44,326
Oh, Zowie?
Oh, he's just fine, thank you.

244
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,726
Thought he might be sick,
that's why I came out.

245
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:51,392
- No, he's just fine.
- That's good.

246
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:55,465
See, I thought he might be sick
and just thought I'd...

247
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,232
Come out.

248
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,142
My, what a beautiful automobile.

249
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:05,010
- Is it yours?
- Just a little runabout.

250
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:08,675
- There's nothing like a good spin.
- Makes you dizzy.

251
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,015
No, it doesn't, Walter.

252
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,848
It's just I'm not one way
or another about it.

253
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:20,726
Well, I guess I'd better be
running along.

254
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,366
Bye.

255
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,138
Well, I'm glad the dog is all right.

256
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,763
Go on.
Go on.

257
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,196
Go on.

258
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,437
Go on.

259
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,415
Oh, dear.

260
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,750
Here, Zowie. Here, Zowie.

261
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,223
Oh, I'm so sorry.

262
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,456
Oh, Zowie, you bad little dog.

263
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:31,659
Sailor, you get down out
of that contraption. It ain't safe.

264
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:03,929
Smile...

265
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:05,535
...walk...

266
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,565
...cross in front. To the audience.

267
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,402
- To each other.
- To each other.

268
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,411
- Cross in front.
- Cross in front.

269
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:17,241
- To the audience.
- To each other.

270
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,542
- Cross in front...
- That's enough.

271
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:23,916
We get two bows
we'll be doing very well.

272
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:30,352
If we keep on like that, it won't be long
before we can ask Mr. Fields for a trial.

273
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:40,169
Cuba pressed by Spain appeals
to Uncle Sam for aid.

274
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,069
Niagara Falls.

275
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:50,273
That's quite a place for...

276
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,743
I mean, that's quite a place
for people to go.

277
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:55,284
Oh, you mean on honeymoons?

278
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,378
Yeah.

279
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:04,653
Devil's Island. That's interesting too.

280
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,571
- Irene.
- Yes?

281
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,102
We've only known each other
about three months.

282
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,709
Irene.

283
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,540
Irene, have you seen my copy of <i>Vogue?</i>

284
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,839
Oh, here it is, Mother.

285
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,112
- Anything yet?
- Not yet.

286
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,312
Well, I don't wanna interrupt anything.

287
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:45,164
You were saying that we've known
each other for nearly three months.

288
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:48,101
Yes, you see my one aim in life...

289
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,673
...has always been
to keep from getting involved.

290
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:53,868
"Vernon don't get involved,"
I've always said.

291
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:55,603
I mean I used to say.

292
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,376
Well, what do you say now?

293
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:04,010
Well, you know, I think
when people dance well together...

294
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:07,215
...it's because they're sympathetic
to each other.

295
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,361
In fact, that's part
of what I was getting at.

296
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,224
Dancing brings people
closer together.

297
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,492
I don't mean only closer together...

298
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,030
Oh, good evening, darling.

299
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,674
- Good evening, Vernon.
- Good evening, sir.

300
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:28,472
- Hello, Dad.
- Anything happened while I was out?

301
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:33,651
- Everybody finished with the paper?
- Oh, I'll get it for you, Dad.

302
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:38,913
Oh, thank you.

303
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,830
Some new records I brought.

304
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:51,529
Somebody flying an airship
across the English Channel.

305
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,671
Must have been in a hurry.

306
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:57,934
Dr. Foote, Mrs. Foote wants
to see you right away.

307
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,667
Excuse me.

308
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,748
- Can't you leave them alone?
- I've been leaving them alone all winter.

309
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,889
Aren't we ever going to use
that parlor again?

310
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,731
Do you like this tune?

311
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:44,084
<i>Only when you're in my arms</i>

312
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,858
<i>I can reach up to heaven</i>

313
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:51,587
<i>And pluck out a star from the blue</i>

314
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,560
<i>It's true</i>

315
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:59,068
<i>But only when you're in my arms</i>

316
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:02,831
<i>I can live without riches</i>

317
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:06,170
<i>And still have a million or two</i>

318
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,174
<i>It's true</i>

319
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:12,077
<i>But only when you're in my arms</i>

320
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,279
<i>Though I'm ambitious</i>

321
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:20,288
<i>My wishes</i>
<i>Have always been simple and few</i>

322
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,551
<i>Give me the moonlight</i>

323
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,217
<i>The music</i>

324
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:28,195
<i>And darling an armful of you</i>

325
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,793
<i>I can see myself doing</i>

326
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,269
<i>The things that I never could do</i>

327
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,135
<i>It's true</i>

328
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:41,836
<i>But only when you're in my arms</i>

329
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,544
Irene, look, I'm terribly in love with you.

330
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,709
I never thought I'd fall in love
but I have, and I'm glad I have.

331
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,048
And will you please marry me?

332
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:52,655
Yes.

333
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:55,816
- I'm in love with you too.
- You...

334
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,593
Well...

335
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,156
...thanks.

336
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,432
Walter.

337
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:11,063
- Walter, we're going to be married.
- Are you surprised?

338
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,210
Gee, whiz.

339
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:16,836
Well, where do we go on the honeymoon?

340
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:25,550
Dr. Foote, you can start using
the parlor again.

341
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,828
Vernon, I'm scared.

342
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,538
Now, now, sweetheart,
that's no way to talk.

343
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,040
I don't feel so rosy myself.

344
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:49,972
Maybe we're not quite ready yet.

345
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,381
Maybe we should rehearse some more.

346
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:56,315
And come back next week, huh?

347
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,921
- Yes, that's it.
- Come on Walter.

348
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,815
What are you doing, running away?

349
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:04,052
We thought we'd go home,
rehearse more and come back next week.

350
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,993
Next week? Now look,
you've been practicing for months...

351
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:11,101
...and you know everything fine. Why, you
did it for me last night. It was beautiful.

352
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,760
Come right back here and sit down.

353
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,269
When Mr. Fields tells you...

354
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,671
...keep your chin up, your chest out
and put your best foot forward.

355
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:21,073
Hello, Vernon.
Hello, Mrs. Castle.

356
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,180
How are the newlyweds?

357
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:28,049
Well, Vernon, what do you wanna
show me, a bride-and-groom skit?

358
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,084
Mr. Fields, it's a...

359
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:33,588
...it's a sort of a dance.
- It is a dance.

360
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:35,749
Since when have you had
dancing ambitions?

361
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:40,227
- Since he met me.
- Oh. Well, all right, let's look at it.

362
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,129
- Thanks.
- Charlie, put on the front border.

363
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:46,065
You sit here.

364
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:54,144
- I hope I don't disappoint you.
- Come on. You know...

365
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:57,304
...chin up, chest out
and best foot forward.

366
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,040
All right, Walter.

367
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,411
Very nice.

368
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:41,817
No?

369
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:45,778
Why not?

370
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:49,688
Well, now, who's gonna pay money
to see a man dance with his wife?

371
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,591
Look, I'll tell you what I'll do.

372
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:56,131
I'll give Mrs. Castle a line in the show,
and as for you, Vernon...

373
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,359
...next season I'll hand you
a whole new scene.

374
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,232
- That will be...
- Mr. Fields, what kind of a scene?

375
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:04,136
Well, I'll tell you.
The idea is that I'm a bricklayer.

376
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:05,707
- Oh, and I'm your helper.
- Yes.

377
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,641
- You come on with a hat full of bricks.
- And you trip me up.

378
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,974
No, I shove you right in the cement.

379
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:15,245
- And I'm covered with it.
- You clumsy geek, pick up those bricks.

380
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,388
Oh, I see.

381
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,692
See, he is the one, Papa.

382
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,954
The droll one.
Oh, so droll in the barbershop.

383
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:30,096
Right back into the cement.

384
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,132
What's the matter?

385
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,642
- I'm sorry, sir, I can't do it.
- What?

386
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,743
Why not?

387
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,449
We're going to dance together.

388
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:51,918
- Say, whose idea is this?
- Ours.

389
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,693
Well, you know Vernon, as a comedian
you're valuable to me.

390
00:34:56,861 --> 00:35:01,594
But as a dancer... Even two dancers.
- You wouldn't bring in two nickels.

391
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,667
We're sorry, Mr. Fields,
but we think you're wrong.

392
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,532
Maybe I'm wrong,
maybe you're wrong.

393
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,173
Now, don't take it too badly, Mrs. Castle.

394
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,502
We all make mistakes.

395
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,542
See you later, Vernon.

396
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:19,976
Greenhorn.

397
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:24,116
Do you think it's true,
what he said?

398
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,983
We can try some other managers.

399
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:28,557
We want to dance and we're going to.

400
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,518
I wish I knew where.

401
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,129
- Mr. Castle.
- Mr. Castle.

402
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,857
- Mr. Castle.
- Yes.

403
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:40,264
- I'm Mr. Aubel and this is Emile, my son.
- Oh, how do you do?

404
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:44,932
My father and I purchased from Mr. Fields
the French rights to <i>The Hen Pecks.</i>

405
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:47,737
And we reproduce the play
in the Paris next spring.

406
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,504
And we want you for our show.

407
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,243
You want...

408
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,884
Oh, Vernon, darling.

409
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,214
A honeymoon in Paris
and we get paid for it.

410
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,591
- You come?
- Sure, we'll come.

411
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:02,419
Oh, Walter, I don't know about you.

412
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,959
Walter, goes with us
if it takes our last cent.

413
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:07,859
Sure.
You think I'll let you two go alone?

414
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:10,125
Gee, whiz.

415
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,421
Wait a minute, there's the theater.

416
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,662
- There's the theater.
- Hold it.

417
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,200
Turn around. Tell him to turn around.
Back there.

418
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:54,000
No, no.

419
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,847
Have him wait, Walter.

420
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:01,212
- No, that's too expensive.
- Whatever, our salary starts any minute.

421
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,498
Hello, Mr. Aubel.

422
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,661
How do you do?

423
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,531
Here we are.

424
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:27,868
I believe you telephoned our secretary.

425
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:31,110
<i>Oui, Oui...</i>
I am very sorry...

426
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,682
...but it is so.
- What?

427
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:36,285
But you told him we were late.

428
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:37,749
Emile?

429
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,482
No, no. We are late.

430
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,785
<i>Nous,</i> not <i>vous.</i>

431
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,894
- The play is late.
- <i>Au revoir...</i>

432
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,996
...we see you in six weeks.

433
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:55,502
Vernon, what are we going to do
in the meantime? We haven't any money.

434
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:58,506
- Wait a minute. <i>Monsieur...</i>
- No, no, let me.

435
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,008
I'm used to this. It's very simple.

436
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,848
Mr. Aubel, could we trouble you
for the usual advance on our salary?

437
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:12,483
You don't understand. I mean,
we're a little short of cash.

438
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,950
Mr. Aubel.

439
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,313
Please.

440
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,620
For you, madam.
Emile.

441
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:57,067
You will please sign... A formality.

442
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,733
Wait, this is for eight days'
salary instead of seven.

443
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,306
Interest, you know?

444
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,340
- Like a bank.
- Oh, yes.

445
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,411
- What, is this customary?
- I guess so.

446
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,310
Our country seems so strange to you.

447
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,917
You must not bother about business.

448
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:19,022
- You are young, and it is Paris, it is spring...
- Papa.

449
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,554
<i>Au revoir,</i> madame.

450
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,472
Zowie, you bad dog. We're so sorry.

451
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,502
I wait.

452
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,510
From now on, we walk.

453
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:48,315
- Pay him, Walter.
- Take Zowie to that fancy hotel and pack.

454
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,716
We're going to look for a flat.

455
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:56,816
Bye.

456
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:00,061
What?

457
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,994
To you.

458
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,641
Well, we got our health, we're young...

459
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,971
...we're in Paris,
we're on our honeymoon...

460
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:18,013
...what more do we want?
- Nothing.

461
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,474
Oh, look.

462
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:24,519
- Isn't that a darling Dutch cap?
- Well, we can afford that.

463
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,713
Oh, no.
No, we can't.

464
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:30,793
- But you want it.
- I told you, I don't want anything but you.

465
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,853
- Mr. Castle.
- Come on, let's hurry.

466
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:38,654
- Hurry up, hurry up.
- Come on, Zow, come on.

467
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,660
Hurry up, Zowie.
Come on, Zowie.

468
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,958
- Oh, did you hurt yourself?
- Zowie.

469
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,461
Hurry up, hurry up.

470
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,304
- I hope I got the key.
- Get in here, Zowie. Hurry up.

471
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,270
That's it, hurry up.

472
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:53,773
Mr. Castle.

473
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:56,879
Where is my money?
For eight weeks you have not paid.

474
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,345
- Where is my money?
- Quiet, if you please.

475
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,577
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

476
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:05,483
Must we be subjected
to all this brawling?

477
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,647
Pardon, madame.
Let me explain.

478
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:12,660
But those young people...
I am hoarse from screaming for my rent.

479
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,288
You will have to scream for his rent,
too, if you don't mind your manners.

480
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:17,764
I've brought him a client...

481
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:21,632
...who can't stand noise.
- Maggie.

482
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,667
Quiet.

483
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:31,539
Such a quaint place, isn't it?
Veritable bit of Bohemia.

484
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,548
Really, Maggie,
these obscure geniuses of yours.

485
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,949
- I don't know if they're worth it or not.
- I'm sure this one is.

486
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:41,489
Of course you're sure.
You get 10 percent of what I pay him.

487
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:44,093
My nerves are on edge.

488
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:47,263
- Can't you work faster?
- Faster? Faster...

489
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,660
Maggie, I can't stand it.

490
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:54,861
Lady Bolton, please, please.
You take your time.

491
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,539
Look.

492
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:07,172
- Madam, the pose.
- You expect me to pose...

493
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,478
...when we all may be killed
at any instant?

494
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:11,177
I don't care if he is a genius.

495
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:14,813
Either this bedlam ceases, or I leave.

496
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:16,892
Stop it.

497
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:21,055
Stop it up there.

498
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:23,832
All right.

499
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:25,730
We heard you.

500
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,728
Well, at least we can eat.

501
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,100
I'm gonna move out of this place.

502
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:33,834
- Eat what?
- Oh, what have we here?

503
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,613
Would you carve?

504
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,944
- I'm not hungry.
- Oh, Vernon.

505
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:44,385
Why don't we get a call from the Aubels?
Why don't they start?

506
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:47,388
- Maybe we're not in the show.
- You know we are.

507
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:51,324
Oh, Vernon, you're the optimist. You're
the one that always sees the bright side.

508
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:53,258
Bright side?

509
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,193
Look.

510
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:59,598
- Darling, that's all that's left.
- Walter.

511
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:05,037
Quiet. Quiet.

512
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,241
They've started rehearsals
for the show.

513
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:09,311
- Started rehearsals?
- That's what it says.

514
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,108
- Repetition commences.
- Why didn't Mr. Aubel let us know?

515
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:16,013
What's the difference? The show starts,
our salary starts. Come on.

516
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:18,677
- Walter, where are my dancing shoes?
- In the trunk.

517
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,586
- Oh, no, they're on your feet.
- Oh. Come on, let's go.

518
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,193
Oh, wait a minute.
I can't go until I press my suit.

519
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:27,228
- You and Walter go, I'll meet you there.
- All right. Hurry.

520
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:41,973
Hello, Mr. Aubel.

521
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:44,671
Ah, Monsieur Castle.

522
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:48,511
Why didn't you tell us rehearsals started?
Did you think we didn't need any?

523
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,315
- But you knew what you have to do.
- Come.

524
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:01,594
There she is.

525
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:04,327
- Oh, but you hired us to dance.
- Dance?

526
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,196
No, no, no.
We have the dance.

527
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,033
- Oh, you will be a knockout, Mr. Castle.
- All Paris will laugh.

528
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,937
You are a very funny man.

529
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:16,545
<i>The whole French nation</i>
<i>You will hear them saying</i>

530
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,741
<i>A real sensation and the people</i>
<i>Will stay till the break of the day</i>

531
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:23,250
<i>While we are dancing</i>

532
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,986
Well...

533
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:35,255
...what happened?

534
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:37,460
False alarm.

535
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:39,666
Hello, Zowie.

536
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:43,071
I got myself all pressed up.

537
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:44,672
You look nice too.

538
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:46,173
Don't she, Vernon?

539
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,177
Yeah.

540
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,187
What happened?

541
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:09,188
Well...

542
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,869
Here's a present for you.

543
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:21,901
Oh, my little Dutch cap.

544
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,348
We didn't have money to buy this.

545
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:28,451
We haven't now.

546
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,785
Darling, they didn't hire us to dance.

547
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:35,220
They just want me for
the barbershop scene I did with Fields.

548
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:38,051
I won't do it, Irene.
I told them I wouldn't.

549
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:41,490
But then they brought up
the money we owe them.

550
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:48,000
Vernon, would they let you dance alone...

551
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:50,140
...because if they would...

552
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:53,071
Do you think I'd wanna dance
without you?

553
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:57,814
I should have let you
keep on doing what you were doing.

554
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:00,182
It's all my fault.

555
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,119
No, it isn't.

556
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:06,049
Look, darling, we're all right now.

557
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,418
After all, you have got a job.

558
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:12,289
May not be the job we wanted,
but still it's a job.

559
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:13,952
Maybe later on...

560
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:15,894
...we get a chance...

561
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,293
...sometime.

562
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,261
Maybe sometime.

563
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,471
Hey.

564
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,878
Dance with me.

565
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:38,385
All the people downstairs...

566
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:42,221
Look.

567
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:44,860
We can do it quietly, like this:

568
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:47,563
Just as if we're walking on air.

569
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:51,726
Funny, and we're down to earth
for the first time.

570
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:15,687
- What do you suppose they're doing?
- And you call me nervous.

571
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:18,919
I'm not nervous, I'm simply curious.

572
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:21,555
That's nice.

573
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:25,327
Take a good look, Walter.
This is our farewell appearance.

574
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:36,711
Get me a chair.

575
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:40,810
I said get me a chair.

576
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:45,511
What do you call that...?
That... what you were doing.

577
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:49,590
Oh. Well, l... I don't know, I guess
you might call it the Castle Walk.

578
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,820
- Castle Walk?
- Castle, that's our name.

579
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:55,556
I'm Vernon Castle, and this is my wife.

580
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:57,791
My name's Walter.

581
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:01,169
I'm Maggie Sutton.

582
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:06,605
Oh. Maggie Sutton,
of course.

583
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,504
How would you like to try out
for a dancing job?

584
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,671
- What?
- Where?

585
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:14,510
At the Cafe de Paris.

586
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:17,245
Cafe de Paris? Irene.

587
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:21,450
- You know the manager?
- My dear, the manager knows me.

588
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,287
- Darling, we got a job.
- Ah, just a tryout.

589
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,759
All I could guarantee
would be your dinner.

590
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:30,195
Well, maybe you could arrange
that for tonight... The dinner, I mean.

591
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:34,701
- And we could dance tomorrow night.
- Well, I think it might be arranged that way.

592
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:37,032
- Dinner at the Cafe de Paris.
- Dinner anyplace.

593
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:40,275
Dinner.

594
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,547
- Does this person dance too?
- No, but I eat.

595
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,946
Walter is our sort of manager.

596
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:50,915
He was your manager.

597
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:52,919
You mean you're an agent.

598
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:54,853
I'm an entrepreneuse...

599
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:57,683
...but I still expect my 10 percent.

600
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:03,032
That's some old crank downstairs.
Don't pay no attention.

601
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:08,234
I beg your pardon?

602
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:11,601
Everyone is staring at you.

603
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:13,326
Oh, dear, I hope not.

604
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:16,267
Because you look so beautiful.
Just like a bride.

605
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,932
I should in my wedding dress,
my Dutch cap.

606
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,767
I hope it brings us luck.

607
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:24,675
I am honored by your presence,
Your Highness.

608
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:28,011
My dear Louis, thank
Miss Sutton. She is my guide to Paris.

609
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:31,120
And none better, Your Highness.

610
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:37,786
They look very respectable for dancers.

611
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:39,258
Dancers? Who dances?

612
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:43,058
You must come back tomorrow night,
Louis has a treat for you. Two Americans.

613
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:45,326
But tomorrow I'm leaving
for St. Petersburg.

614
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:49,029
- Why do they not dance tonight?
- Well, I doubt if they're prepared.

615
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:50,969
How does one prepare for a dance?

616
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:53,234
One simply dances.

617
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,275
Have them dance.

618
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:59,474
I think it's going to be quite amusing.
American dancers.

619
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:03,219
- A little more caviar, please.
- Foie gras too.

620
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:05,616
And plenty of the truffles.

621
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,485
Such a rush all day,
I didn't even have time for tea.

622
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:12,094
I lunched at the club.
Food is very dull there.

623
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,556
- Can you dance now?
- Now, tonight?

624
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:17,461
I have a Grand Duke over there.

625
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,864
If he likes you, you're made.

626
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,868
- The orchestra.
- We haven't rehearsed with them.

627
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:25,530
Oh, they can play anything you want.

628
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:28,177
- But our dinner.
- No, no, no, dance first.

629
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:30,711
But if he doesn't like us,
do we still get dinner?

630
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:32,872
If you feel like it.

631
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:36,976
Well, Vernon, we've nothing to lose.

632
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:40,215
Tell them to play,
"Too Much Mustard."

633
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:02,938
- Oh, Vernon, I've forgotten everything.
- No. Come on, dance with me.

634
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,483
I raised them.

635
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:55,752
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. And Mrs. Castle...

636
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:58,086
...will dance again in one half-hour.

637
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:01,624
You know,
it's funny I'm not a bit hungry now.

638
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,629
- Neither am I.
- You can't waste it.

639
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,233
Oh, <i>magnifique.</i>

640
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:08,963
From now on you dance here every night,
I pay you.

641
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,437
A tip from the Grand Duke.

642
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:14,168
A tip?
We can't possibly accept it.

643
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:18,872
- We're very grateful but...
- No, this is no time to be proud. We need it.

644
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:22,384
Irene, look what they're doing.

645
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:28,451
I think you've started something tonight,
Mr. And Mrs. Vernon Castle.

646
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:36,669
Isn't there anything in this country
except the Castles?

647
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:26,420
This is getting to be the most...

648
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:05,752
<i>Chicago, Chicago, that toddling town</i>

649
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:30,207
<i>Hello, Frisco, Hello</i>

650
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:44,993
<i>Way down yonder in New Orleans</i>

651
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:52,399
<i>Take me back to New York Town</i>

652
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:00,802
When are you going
to break the news to Maggie?

653
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:03,343
The moment she mentions another tour.

654
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:07,313
- You're going to have trouble with her.
- Is it Maggie's life, or ours?

655
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:10,680
- It's ours.
- It's time she found that out.

656
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:12,946
Very nice.

657
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:16,817
Well, children, I have some vulgar
financial matters to take up with you.

658
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:18,961
Here are some ideas
for your next tour.

659
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:21,289
There isn't going to be
a tour for a while.

660
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:25,192
Oh, of course, I know you're tired.

661
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:28,428
So I've arranged to have
a week's rest before you start out.

662
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:34,938
- What's this?
- Going out on the platform. She needs air.

663
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:37,375
Another mouth to feed.
That makes seven.

664
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:40,914
- Where and when did you buy that?
- In Baltimore.

665
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:43,881
Here's the bill.
Hello, Maggie.

666
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,649
Maggie? Very touching.

667
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:51,853
We'll be in New York in an hour.
It would help if you would sign this now.

668
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:54,326
Maggie, we want to buy
a house in the country.

669
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,897
- All right, buy it.
- Yes, but we want to live in it.

670
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:58,556
All right, live in it.

671
01:03:58,734 --> 01:04:01,168
She don't want air, she wants water.
Come on, Mag.

672
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:07,903
Listen, you two,
you better make hay while the sun shines.

673
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:10,204
Maggie, we're in love.
We've made enough money.

674
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:14,713
- We want to live like simple, married people.
- In a house with our clothes in closets.

675
01:04:14,884 --> 01:04:16,681
We're not going to sign any contracts.

676
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,844
We've got it planned.
We'll visit England.

677
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:23,048
And Vernon's going to show me where
he was born and where he went to school...

678
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:26,286
Well, everything he knew before he met me.

679
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:28,657
I didn't know anything before I met you.

680
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:32,990
Seems to be a strong smell
of honey-suckling roses in this car.

681
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:35,034
And you can't raise horses and dogs...

682
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,900
...and children on a dancing tour,
you know that, Maggie.

683
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:41,804
Well, if I were your age
and had your opportunities...

684
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:44,003
Don't try to talk us out of it. We're firm.

685
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:47,581
- Don't interrupt me. As I was about to say...
- It won't make a difference.

686
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,216
I was about to say...

687
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:53,412
...l'd want to do exactly
what you're going to do.

688
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,120
Where are we?

689
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:02,589
Extra! Extra!

690
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,062
Here, boy. Boy.

691
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:16,578
Germany declares war,
England mobilizes.

692
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:20,112
"Thousands volunteer for British army."

693
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:31,723
I guess it won't amount to anything.
It says here that Europe can't afford a war.

694
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:34,124
It would probably be over in a week.

695
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,972
- Will you spend the night here?
- I should say not.

696
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:48,667
I find the country quiet
very disturbing.

697
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:52,644
How would you like to be back in Paris?
I see by the papers they bombed it again.

698
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:54,248
Here comes Sailor.

699
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:57,511
- Hello, Maggie.
- Hello there.

700
01:05:57,853 --> 01:06:00,947
- Have you told Vernon who was here yet?
- No, but I will.

701
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:02,918
How are you, Maggie, old girl.

702
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:10,198
Irene, you ready
to come back to the outside world?

703
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:13,335
As far as we're concerned,
there's nothing going on in the world.

704
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:15,493
There's a war going on.

705
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:19,633
- Don't talk that way in front of Vernon.
- Then it's on his mind?

706
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,103
No, not at all.

707
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:25,008
Women are pathetic when they try
to fight something bigger than they are.

708
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:27,149
I'm not trying to fight anything.

709
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:28,749
Vernon's my life.

710
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:31,546
I'm his life.
Isn't that enough?

711
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:35,179
One girl against an army?
It isn't quite enough, Irene.

712
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:38,125
Come on, let's find Vernon.

713
01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:47,591
- Vernon, Maggie's here.
- Oh, hello, Maggie.

714
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:51,167
- Vernon.
- What's the matter?

715
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:53,308
Oh, Vernon.

716
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:57,578
Oh, the uniform.
It's for the British benefit, Sunday night.

717
01:06:57,747 --> 01:06:59,476
They've asked me to dance.
I told you.

718
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:01,843
Well, if this is your idea of a joke...

719
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:05,078
No. Oh, I'm sorry, darling.

720
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:09,088
I haven't enlisted. Some crazy fellow
in the Publicity department sent this down.

721
01:07:09,258 --> 01:07:12,056
I'm... I'm not going to wear it,
I just tried it on.

722
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:16,556
So you went and done it, huh?

723
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:19,496
- No, Walter...
- You told me if you enlisted, I could join up.

724
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:23,069
It isn't real. It's just a uniform for benefit.
It doesn't mean a thing.

725
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:26,299
- He's not even going to wear it.
- Of course not.

726
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:29,933
Come on, Walter. We'll send this back.
I'll dig out something else to wear.

727
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:32,838
Looks like a regular soldier, don't he?

728
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:35,176
Here's the afternoon paper.

729
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:43,347
- I don't dare read the newspapers anymore.
- Neither do I.

730
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:46,051
- Oh, Maggie, what am I going to do?
- Nothing.

731
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:50,028
War is a man's business.
Women only do what they're told.

732
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:55,468
<i>It's a long way to Tipperary</i>

733
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:59,506
<i>It's a long way to go</i>

734
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:03,337
<i>It's a long way to Tipperary</i>

735
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:07,243
<i>To the sweetest girl I know</i>

736
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:12,382
You're next, Mr. Castle. Two thousand
people waiting to see you.

737
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:15,583
They didn't come to see me.
They came to see them.

738
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:19,353
<i>It's a long, long way to Tipperary</i>

739
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:23,487
<i>But my heart's right there</i>

740
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:25,531
Ready, Mr. Castle.

741
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:28,701
Mr. Castle?

742
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:31,034
Go on, darling.

743
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:39,772
<i>Jeremiah Jones, a ladies' man was he</i>

744
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:43,248
<i>Any pretty girl could turn his head</i>

745
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:46,980
<i>But he got an awful fright</i>
<i>While strolling out one night</i>

746
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:50,353
<i>When someone winked at him and said:</i>

747
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:57,832
There you are. Off you go.

748
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:02,965
<i>Hello, hello</i>
<i>Who's your lady friend?</i>

749
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:06,506
<i>Who's the little girlie by your side?</i>

750
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:10,267
<i>I've seen you with a girl or two</i>

751
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:13,882
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>
<i>I am surprised at you</i>

752
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:17,678
<i>Hello, hello</i>
<i>Stop your little games</i>

753
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:21,186
<i>Don't you think your ways</i>
<i>You ought to mend?</i>

754
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:24,915
<i>This isn't the girl I saw you with</i>
<i>At Brighton</i>

755
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:28,791
<i>Who, who, who's your lady?</i>
<i>Who, who, who's your lady?</i>

756
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:32,092
<i>Who, who, who's your lady friend?</i>

757
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:05,025
<i>This isn't the girl I saw you with</i>
<i>At Brighton</i>

758
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:08,932
<i>Who, who, who's your lady friend?</i>

759
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:17,978
Take another bow, Mr. Castle?

760
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:19,944
No, Frank, let them take the bows.

761
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:22,580
Fine bunch of men.

762
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:30,522
Ladies and gentlemen,
we want to thank all of the performers...

763
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:32,820
...who have willingly given
their services to...

764
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:35,862
- Where's the recruiting officer?
- A man here wants to join up.

765
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:38,261
He's over there talking with Mr. Castle.

766
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:43,064
- To thank this splendid representative body
of Canadian men.

767
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:59,611
- Frank, have you seen Mr. Castle?
- He went downstairs.

768
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:01,255
Oh, my.

769
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:08,189
Vernon.

770
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:17,396
Darling, I have enlisted
in the Royal Flying Corps.

771
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:20,699
I had to, Irene.

772
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:24,573
Maybe if America were in the war, you'd
understand how I feel, why I have to go.

773
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:26,408
I know.

774
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:28,510
It won't last long.

775
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:30,982
They say one more push,
and it'll all be over.

776
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:34,114
That's not so bad, is it?

777
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:39,818
And I'll come back,
and we'll settle down...

778
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:42,925
...and have the house again
and everything.

779
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:44,460
Just as we were.

780
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:47,498
Yes, darling.

781
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:49,734
They may kick me out sooner than that.

782
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:52,601
I'll probably make a very bad soldier.

783
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:55,470
You'll make a very good soldier.

784
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,895
- Hey, look at your aileron, sir.
- Yeah, I know.

785
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:35,866
- How'd you get back?
- I had to get back.

786
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:38,836
- My furlough starts this afternoon.
- I'll say you earned it.

787
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:41,237
Telegram, Lieutenant Castle.

788
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:44,908
- Sailor's in Paris.
- What?

789
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:48,248
We'll be seeing her tonight,
do you realize that?

790
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:49,850
We'll be seeing her. Come on.

791
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:53,353
- Castle.
- Yes, sir?

792
01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:56,855
- You better see these plate holders.
- What's the matter with them?

793
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,725
- Busted the whole lot of them.
- I'm afraid so.

794
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:07,562
- That bullet had your name on it.
- It's a lucky thing this case was in the way.

795
01:15:07,736 --> 01:15:11,536
- Well, we can get them tomorrow.
- But I start my leave this afternoon, sir.

796
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:13,839
I'm afraid it'll have to be postponed.

797
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:16,739
GHQ wants this sector covered.

798
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:19,312
- Can I go up right now?
- Without a convoy?

799
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:21,073
Yes, sir, I can use Morgan's plane.

800
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:24,947
- Well, go ahead. Good luck.
- Thanks.

801
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,521
- Hey, Flight, stand by that plane.
- Yes, sir.

802
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:33,083
- Why don't you get going?
- Where?

803
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:36,425
Paris. Tell Irene
I'll meet her at Louis' at 8:00.

804
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:38,862
- Contact.
- Contact.

805
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:42,069
Tell her to save the first dance for me.

806
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:06,791
Well, don't just sit there, talk.

807
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:10,527
- There ain't much news where I come from.
- Then make some up.

808
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,800
Well, we lost a couple of planes
this morning, but...

809
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:20,699
- but they lost more.

810
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:24,241
I guess that ain't very interesting.

811
01:16:25,447 --> 01:16:29,406
Did you tell Walter about your offer
to go to California to make moving pictures?

812
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,450
No, is that so?

813
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:35,654
- Maggie, why doesn't he come?
- Now, now, he's all right.

814
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:41,561
Back home, I used to think,
"Oh, if I could only be over there with him."

815
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:44,491
And now I'm here, and...

816
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:47,063
...he's not.

817
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:56,337
Ladies and gentlemen, a few years ago,
I introduced for the first time...

818
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:58,706
...someone who is now most famous.

819
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,906
She has come back to dance for us
again tonight.

820
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:04,746
Mrs. Vernon Castle.

821
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:23,032
Ladies and gentlemen, l...

822
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:25,798
l...

823
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,819
Oh, Vernon.

824
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:57,955
It's quarter to 5.

825
01:20:04,432 --> 01:20:06,423
It's almost daylight.

826
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:16,369
Oh, Vernon, how long do you think
it will go on?

827
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:19,605
I don't know. Nobody seems to know.

828
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:22,249
Is it terribly dangerous in those planes?

829
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:26,683
I mean, worse than in the trenches?

830
01:20:26,855 --> 01:20:29,221
Darling, we said
we wouldn't talk about it tonight.

831
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:32,155
I know, but it's almost morning,
and you'll be going back...

832
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:35,455
...and I won't see you for a long time.

833
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:39,427
I shouldn't worry, it's foolish.

834
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:42,832
I'm not the only soldier's wife,
I know that.

835
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:46,372
You will be careful, won't you?

836
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:49,076
I'll be careful.

837
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:52,306
And what's more I think
I'm going to be lucky.

838
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,744
- Lucky?
- Yes.

839
01:20:54,916 --> 01:20:57,146
They say there's one bullet
with your name on it.

840
01:20:57,319 --> 01:21:00,152
If it misses you, you come out all right.

841
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:04,486
Well, I think my bullet
missed me yesterday.

842
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:05,921
Darling.

843
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:09,621
And from now on,
I'm gonna be all right.

844
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:12,698
It's a good idea to hang on to.

845
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:15,696
I'll hang on to it.

846
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:23,310
You think of everything, don't you?

847
01:21:23,478 --> 01:21:25,742
You thought of coming here
instead of the Ritz...

848
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:29,350
...or some place
that might not feel quite like home.

849
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,112
What's that?

850
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:39,085
Oh, Vernon, maybe the war is over.

851
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:50,965
What's happened?

852
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:05,043
The Americans have come into the war.

853
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:06,718
- America.
- Hooray.

854
01:22:06,888 --> 01:22:09,652
- You know what that means.
- The war is practically over.

855
01:22:09,824 --> 01:22:12,520
Yeah.

856
01:23:16,424 --> 01:23:17,755
Get out, this is the picture.

857
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:21,555
- Now, camera, action.
- We're ready, Mrs. Castle.

858
01:23:31,539 --> 01:23:34,372
All right, Mrs. Castle.
All right, Mr. D'Arcy.

859
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:38,000
Now, let's make this bigger
than the war.

860
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:42,316
Ready... camera... action!

861
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:44,315
That's it, Mrs. Castle, closer.

862
01:23:44,486 --> 01:23:46,545
Mrs. Castle, closer...

863
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:48,951
- Bigger eyes, Mrs. Castle.
- Irene, telephone.

864
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:51,251
Can't you see we're shooting?

865
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:55,157
Irene, Vernon's on the telephone.
He's in Canada.

866
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:57,730
Oh, Vernon. Oh, excuse me.

867
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:00,096
Cut!

868
01:24:03,638 --> 01:24:05,469
Cut!

869
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:09,032
Cut.

870
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:12,039
Hello? Hello!

871
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:14,443
Darling, I just landed in Canada.

872
01:24:14,616 --> 01:24:17,847
Yeah, but I'm being transferred
next week to Fort Worth, Texas.

873
01:24:18,019 --> 01:24:20,920
Fort Worth, Texas?
Well, that's practically here.

874
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:23,990
I know. I'm to be a flying instructor
for the American Army.

875
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,992
Hello, Sailor, how are you?

876
01:24:27,495 --> 01:24:29,827
- Tell her who it is.
- That was Walter.

877
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:31,625
Can you meet me there next weekend?

878
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:35,463
- Next weekend? Oh, I can't wait.
- Me too.

879
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:38,003
Yes, darling.

880
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:07,058
Now, I want a room where we can have
dinner and absolute privacy.

881
01:25:07,235 --> 01:25:09,760
You just leave it to me, captain.

882
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,068
This ain't so much.

883
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:15,835
- Nice set up, huh. Cozy?
- Yes, this will do.

884
01:25:16,144 --> 01:25:19,113
I know the ladies,
they like things nice.

885
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,908
- Say, who do you think is gonna be...?
- Walter.

886
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:27,544
- My friend here is a bit strait-laced.
- Sure, I know the type. Reformer.

887
01:25:27,722 --> 01:25:30,987
Well, he's in the army now, eh, captain?

888
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:32,524
Can you close off that garden?

889
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:36,289
- You'll be as snug as a bug in a rug here.
- I want to reserve the garden too.

890
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:39,228
But that's for special occasions.
Our orchestra plays there.

891
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,800
- I want the orchestra.
- Oh, atmosphere, huh?

892
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:44,734
- No, music, you dumb...
- Walter...

893
01:25:44,906 --> 01:25:48,535
...try to be a little more sophisticated,
like the gentleman here.

894
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:50,143
Oh, here he is, in here.

895
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:52,905
Captain, you are to report
back to the field immediately.

896
01:25:53,081 --> 01:25:54,514
Not me, I've got weekend leave.

897
01:25:54,682 --> 01:25:56,809
I'm sorry, captain.
I know you just got here...

898
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:59,010
...but a brigadier general
blew in.

899
01:25:59,187 --> 01:26:01,417
They want all pilots in the air
this afternoon.

900
01:26:01,589 --> 01:26:03,352
Thank you, lieutenant.

901
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:07,658
Well, it looks as if
I have to leave it all to you.

902
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:11,788
I know what you want. A hot bird, a cold
bottle and a warm shoulder, eh, captain?

903
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:14,935
Look, here's the list of the music
I want the orchestra to play.

904
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:17,697
Take care of it and explain to the lady
I may be late.

905
01:26:17,872 --> 01:26:20,841
- Sure will. What name will she give?
- It's his wife.

906
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:23,477
- Your wife?
- Yes, do you mind?

907
01:26:23,645 --> 01:26:27,206
No, I don't mind,
but I don't understand it.

908
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:43,893
All right, Castle.

909
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,625
Only one more hour.

910
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:51,896
Hey, young fellow, sit in the back.

911
01:26:52,073 --> 01:26:54,541
But the officer just told me
that student pilots...

912
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:57,439
- I know, I like to ride in front.
- Yes, sir.

913
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,613
Why won't Captain Castle
ever ride in the back seat?

914
01:27:00,782 --> 01:27:03,512
Nobody can make him
since that crash in Canada...

915
01:27:03,685 --> 01:27:07,086
...when the boy in front got killed.
- Gas on, switch off.

916
01:27:07,922 --> 01:27:09,549
- Contact.
- Contact.

917
01:27:31,045 --> 01:27:33,946
Here we are.
Nice, huh? Best suite in the house.

918
01:27:34,115 --> 01:27:35,912
You're across the hall, Miss Sutton.

919
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:38,552
Did Captain Castle say
how long he'd be at the field?

920
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:42,053
No ma'am, but he arranged for dinner
at 7:30 in the private dining room.

921
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:45,954
- Sounds almost wicked.
- We cater only to a family trade, ma'am.

922
01:27:46,127 --> 01:27:48,891
- I beg your pardon.
- Not at all. My card.

923
01:27:49,063 --> 01:27:52,521
If we can ever be of any service to you,
call on me.

924
01:27:54,168 --> 01:27:57,569
- A wife-beater if ever I saw one.
- Maggie, won't you have dinner with us?

925
01:27:57,739 --> 01:28:00,367
- We'd love to have you.
- Liar. You'd better get dressed.

926
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:14,278
Here comes Castle's squadron now.

927
01:28:15,156 --> 01:28:17,124
Colonel, look out there.

928
01:28:18,826 --> 01:28:21,795
Don't let that fool take off.
Flag him down.

929
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:19,514
Walter.

930
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:21,989
Oh, it's wonderful to see you.

931
01:29:22,156 --> 01:29:23,589
- Hello, Sailor.
- Where's Vernon?

932
01:29:23,758 --> 01:29:25,089
Oh, so that's it.

933
01:29:25,259 --> 01:29:26,817
Vernon?

934
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:31,858
We wait months to see each other,
now you play games.

935
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,358
Vernon.

936
01:29:37,138 --> 01:29:38,799
Where is he?

937
01:29:40,341 --> 01:29:42,172
What's happened?

938
01:29:42,477 --> 01:29:45,105
Sailor, Vernon's...

939
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:47,110
He's hurt.

940
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:51,409
Well, where is he? I've got to...

941
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:56,856
No.

942
01:29:58,526 --> 01:30:04,294
He had his choice of
hitting another plane or crashing his own.

943
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:07,296
The student with him wasn't hurt much.

944
01:30:07,468 --> 01:30:09,959
But Vernon was in the front seat.

945
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:15,672
He was a hero, Sailor.

946
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:18,203
Oh, Vernon.

947
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:21,214
They'll remember what he did
this afternoon.

948
01:30:21,382 --> 01:30:24,044
They'll remember a lot of things he did.

949
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:28,617
The way he laughed
and the way he danced.

950
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:31,691
The way he made other people
want to dance.

951
01:30:32,226 --> 01:30:34,660
Walter, he was just beginning to live.

952
01:30:34,829 --> 01:30:38,856
He'll go on living. For you, and me.

953
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:42,196
Maybe even for a lot of people
that never knew him.

954
01:30:42,403 --> 01:30:47,102
There's got to be something in him in every
boy and girl that get up and dance together.

955
01:30:48,843 --> 01:30:54,110
They were singing that the day I met him
out in the water, with Zowie.

956
01:30:54,549 --> 01:30:58,144
- I'd better get down and tell them to stop.
- No.

957
01:30:58,419 --> 01:31:00,944
He wanted them tonight.

958
01:31:03,324 --> 01:31:07,784
That was at the train,
the first time he kissed me.

959
01:31:08,596 --> 01:31:10,564
Don't, Sailor.

960
01:31:11,999 --> 01:31:14,467
Don't you want to go to your room now?

961
01:31:16,404 --> 01:31:18,463
Go tell Maggie.

962
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,951
