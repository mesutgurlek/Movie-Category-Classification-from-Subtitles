1
00:07:03,528 --> 00:07:06,848
Step right up to the platform,
ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:11,088
You will see the greatest show
on the midway for only 50 cents.

3
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:14,688
These little ladies are entertaining
you now, but in just a moment...

4
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:17,648
...Little Egypt will turn on her stuff.

5
00:07:17,808 --> 00:07:21,169
She has danced before
all the crown heads of Europe.

6
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:25,409
She makes blue blood
turn into red.

7
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:32,568
Ladies and gentlemen, step right up...

8
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:36,848
...and buy your tickets for Sandow,
the strongest man in the world.

9
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:40,888
He juggles pianos.
He plays marbles with cannonballs.

10
00:07:41,048 --> 00:07:44,049
He lifts 10 times his own weight
with one arm.

11
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:47,528
He can even raise his own salary.

12
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:50,368
Now, folks, step right this way.

13
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:54,848
You are looking at the sensation of the fair,
the eighth Wonder of the World.

14
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,808
Ladies and gentlemen,
this way. This way.

15
00:07:57,968 --> 00:08:00,248
This little lady has wiggled herself...

16
00:08:00,408 --> 00:08:03,288
...from the desert
to the shores of Lake Michigan.

17
00:08:03,448 --> 00:08:07,168
And she's about to give you
an exhibition absolutely free.

18
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:11,408
Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the dance
that Little Egypt does inside...

19
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:15,088
...but to prove our generosity,
we're going to give a demonstration...

20
00:08:15,248 --> 00:08:19,248
...of that famous dance,
the hootchy-kootch. Egypt, wiggle.

21
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:24,207
That's sufficient.
Now, ladies and gentlemen--

22
00:08:24,368 --> 00:08:26,127
He's a masterpiece of manhood.

23
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:30,968
Step up to the box office and buy
your tickets. The show's about to begin.

24
00:08:31,128 --> 00:08:33,568
--phenomenon.
Ladies and gentlemen, this--

25
00:08:33,728 --> 00:08:37,247
Well, how's business, Ziggy?

26
00:08:46,287 --> 00:08:50,127
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Sandow concludes this performance...

27
00:08:50,288 --> 00:08:54,487
...by lifting, with Herculean strength,
the largest dumbbell in the world.

28
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:57,048
An unusual feat,
ladies and gentlemen...

29
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,647
...for inside this huge dumbbell,
there are other dumbbells.

30
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:04,087
Ladies and gentlemen, look.

31
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:09,368
There you are. Aren't they beautiful?
Aren't they glorious?

32
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:12,887
A total weight of 750 pounds.

33
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:18,168
Isn't it wonderful? Isn't it marvelous?
Let's give him a big hand.

34
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:28,727
What made you bring me
to a show of this kind?

35
00:09:28,887 --> 00:09:31,367
Well, you wouldn't let me see Little Egypt.

36
00:09:31,527 --> 00:09:34,767
I'll bet a heifer against a mare
the weights ain't on the level.

37
00:09:34,927 --> 00:09:38,288
Seven hundred and fifty pounds, my foot.

38
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:42,527
- I wonder what her total weight is. Oh, Bill?
- Yes, sir.

39
00:09:42,688 --> 00:09:46,007
- Open the curtains, will you?
- Open up those curtains.

40
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:52,047
Hey, Bill, you know, it seems to me
that this platform--

41
00:09:52,247 --> 00:09:55,967
Oh, hello, baby.
Want some candy, Jane, huh?

42
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:58,727
Bill, we ought to have
this platform built higher.

43
00:09:58,887 --> 00:10:02,647
There ought to be more steps.
The people in the back row can hardly see.

44
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:06,927
But, Mr. Ziegfeld, there's never
anybody in the back rows.

45
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:11,407
Well, nevertheless, I want this higher.
There ought to be a lot more steps.

46
00:10:11,607 --> 00:10:14,167
Okay, Mr. Ziegfeld.

47
00:10:18,807 --> 00:10:21,767
I'm sorry I lost my temper, Florenz...

48
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:25,327
...but I am awful disappointed.

49
00:10:25,487 --> 00:10:29,047
I hope you never get
downright disgusted.

50
00:10:29,207 --> 00:10:32,367
What is wrong?
Why don't they come in?

51
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:34,687
You're the attraction,
and you're asking me?

52
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:37,207
Maybe you would like
to cancel my contract.

53
00:10:37,366 --> 00:10:40,687
Oh, no, Sandow.
When I make a deal, it's a deal.

54
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:44,086
I like that. I like you.

55
00:10:44,247 --> 00:10:45,527
Well, I like you too.

56
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:49,966
If you want to pay me some of my
back salary, I take you to dinner, yeah?

57
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:53,047
Well, I'm not very hungry.

58
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:55,527
You're not worrying
about your money, are you?

59
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:58,726
- You don't think I'd ever walk out on you?
- No, no.

60
00:10:58,886 --> 00:11:02,166
Nobody do that to Sandow.

61
00:11:02,807 --> 00:11:07,086
- Maybe I better take you to dinner.
- That's fine.

62
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:10,926
Hands up, mister, and give me
all your money.

63
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:14,287
Well, I can't give you anything
with my hands up, sweetheart.

64
00:11:14,447 --> 00:11:17,966
All right, fresh, 23 skidoo for you.
I'll help myself.

65
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:21,926
Oh, no. Oh, I see you got
my little surprise.

66
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:24,966
This morning. Gee, ain't it swell?

67
00:11:25,127 --> 00:11:28,046
- Were you really surprised?
- Well, wouldn't you be?

68
00:11:28,246 --> 00:11:31,326
- Yes.
- If you expected a diamond ring.

69
00:11:31,486 --> 00:11:33,926
Oh, don't be--
Tell you what we'll do.

70
00:11:34,086 --> 00:11:38,046
- We'll go to the Little Vienna Restaurant.
- Oh, I'd like that.

71
00:11:38,206 --> 00:11:40,686
- Telegram, Mr. Billings.
- Oh, thank you.

72
00:11:40,846 --> 00:11:44,366
Just wait a minute. There might
be an answer. Let me see.

73
00:11:44,526 --> 00:11:46,647
- Oh, well, I'll be.
- Bad news?

74
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,247
No, it's from Ziegfeld.
He's across the midway.

75
00:11:49,406 --> 00:11:51,566
He can touch me,
but he has to send wires.

76
00:11:51,766 --> 00:11:55,446
Listen, "In Little Egypt, you have
the best female attraction of the fair.

77
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:58,286
In Sandow, I have the greatest
male attraction.

78
00:11:58,486 --> 00:12:01,966
Why not fake a romance?
The people will eat it up.

79
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:05,446
Then we can show them together,
and I'd be willing to split 50-50."

80
00:12:05,646 --> 00:12:08,526
- Well, that sounds like a great idea.
- Oh, yes, great.

81
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,926
I'm selling out every performance,
he's going to be thrown out...

82
00:12:12,086 --> 00:12:14,926
...and he's willing to split 50-50.
Give me your pencil.

83
00:12:15,086 --> 00:12:16,286
I'll answer this one.

84
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:17,846
- Jack?
- Yes.

85
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:21,806
- Is Ziegfeld a good friend of yours?
- Oh, yes, we've been pals for years.

86
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:24,205
- But you wouldn't like him.
- No?

87
00:12:24,406 --> 00:12:28,166
No, he's up one day and broke the next.
If he got $ 10,000 tomorrow...

88
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:31,006
...he'd spend it on the girl
he liked tomorrow night.

89
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,166
Wouldn't want to waste your time
meeting a fellow like that.

90
00:12:34,326 --> 00:12:39,166
- Not if I met him on the right night.
- On the right--? Oh, don't you--

91
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:44,566
- Shut up! And just send that collect.
- Yes, sir, and I'll deliver it too, sir.

92
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:48,366
Because every time I take Mr. Ziegfeld
a message, he gives me 50 cents.

93
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:50,245
- Oh, he does, does he?
- Sure.

94
00:12:50,406 --> 00:12:55,286
Yes, well, that's probably
why he's always broke. Come on, dear.

95
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:18,445
This cheese is so strong it could
walk over and say hello to your coffee.

96
00:13:18,645 --> 00:13:21,885
Well, it had better not.
This coffee's too weak to answer it.

97
00:13:22,045 --> 00:13:23,366
Florenz, you're wonderful.

98
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:28,045
You make jokes even when you're
so worried you can't touch your cold cuts.

99
00:13:28,245 --> 00:13:30,726
I got no appetite neither.

100
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,245
No?

101
00:13:34,485 --> 00:13:37,046
Message for you, Mr. Ziegfeld.

102
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:39,685
- They told me I'd find you here.
- From Billings.

103
00:13:39,845 --> 00:13:43,325
So soon he answers?
He must be crazy about your proposition.

104
00:13:43,486 --> 00:13:45,645
- Yeah.
- Read it to me, Flo. Read it.

105
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:49,605
"Dear Ziggy, your proposition interests me."
What did I tell you?

106
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:53,366
"But why fake a romance
between Sandow and Little Egypt?

107
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:59,725
Let's make Sandow marry Little Egypt,
and I'll split the children with you 50-50."

108
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:02,365
That message was collect.

109
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:07,765
- Fifty cents.
- Have you change for a dollar?

110
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:11,845
- Sure, but you always....
- Keep it.

111
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:13,965
Gee, thanks.

112
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:21,125
Florenz, I love you.
I will break chains for you...

113
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:26,125
...I will lift buildings for you,
but I will not have children for you.

114
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:30,045
But if I have children,
I will not split them.

115
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:35,725
- Oh, hello, Ziggy, I got your wire.
- I just got yours too.

116
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:39,565
Patterson tells me
he's putting you out Saturday.

117
00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:42,085
- He tells me too.
- How do you do, Mr. Ziegfeld?

118
00:14:42,245 --> 00:14:43,885
How do you--?

119
00:14:46,124 --> 00:14:50,165
- How do you do, Miss...?
- Yes, Blair, this is Mr. Ziegfeld.

120
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:54,445
- I'm very happy to know you, Miss Blair.
- I'm so happy to meet you, Mr. Ziegfeld.

121
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:57,445
And this is Mr. Sandow,
the strongest man in the--

122
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,645
The strongest man in the world.

123
00:14:59,805 --> 00:15:02,044
Jack tells me
the loveliest things about you.

124
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:04,364
Oh, yes, I imagine.

125
00:15:04,525 --> 00:15:08,125
- I could tell you lovely things about you.
- He's only just met you...

126
00:15:08,285 --> 00:15:10,725
...and he's going to tell
you all about yourself.

127
00:15:10,885 --> 00:15:12,645
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

128
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:16,404
- Oh, but no, we've got-- There's a table--
- I've seen you many times...

129
00:15:16,564 --> 00:15:17,804
...on the midway.

130
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:20,725
- Fibber. I bet you never even noticed me.
- Yes, I have.

131
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:24,045
Yesterday, you were wearing
a red dress trimmed in black lace.

132
00:15:24,244 --> 00:15:27,524
- Yes.
- And a yellow hat, and it was atrocious.

133
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:30,564
- Oh, indeed?
- Each was all right in itself, mind you...

134
00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:32,805
...but the combination....

135
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:36,324
And last Sunday, you were wearing
a blue gown and an orchid hat.

136
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:38,444
- Well, yes.
- And you were wrong again.

137
00:15:38,644 --> 00:15:40,325
Well, aren't we the observer?

138
00:15:40,485 --> 00:15:43,164
Do you always check the right
combinations for women?

139
00:15:43,324 --> 00:15:46,765
- Always for beautiful women.
- Oh, well, that's nice. Thank you.

140
00:15:46,964 --> 00:15:49,964
- How do I look today?
- Well, I don't like your hat.

141
00:15:50,164 --> 00:15:53,804
- It shades your eyes, and I like your eyes.
- Thank you.

142
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:57,484
He ought to be packing his own clothes
instead of selecting yours.

143
00:15:57,684 --> 00:16:00,684
- Come on, Ruth, we've got to go.
- Yes. Well, goodbye, then.

144
00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:06,404
- I'll be seeing you around the grounds.
- Yes. Well, not after Saturday, you won't.

145
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,244
- That fella Billings makes me mad.
- Yes?

146
00:16:15,444 --> 00:16:18,724
Even that music from his Little Egypt
drives me crazy.

147
00:16:18,884 --> 00:16:22,204
You won't have to listen to it
much longer. Wait a minute.

148
00:16:22,364 --> 00:16:26,084
Come away. For five weeks you've been
touching that elephant for luck...

149
00:16:26,244 --> 00:16:28,524
...and now in five days, we get put out.

150
00:16:28,684 --> 00:16:31,323
I know it's superstition,
but an old Hindu told me...

151
00:16:31,484 --> 00:16:36,044
...that if you touch an elephant's trunk,
and he raises it, everything will be all right.

152
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:41,404
Wait, wait. We know we got hard luck
without that elephant should tell us.

153
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:45,884
Say, I know what's wrong. You should
touch him. You're the attraction.

154
00:16:46,044 --> 00:16:48,564
- Me?
- Sure. Go on, go ahead.

155
00:16:48,723 --> 00:16:52,524
It sounds silly, but all right, I'll do it.

156
00:16:55,323 --> 00:17:00,444
Look, Florenz, would he do that for me?
The Great Sandow.

157
00:17:09,364 --> 00:17:11,203
Sandow.

158
00:17:13,724 --> 00:17:17,204
So that's what you call good luck, yeah?

159
00:17:17,363 --> 00:17:22,203
Look, Sandow, you've got to expect
a little rain with the sunshine.

160
00:17:25,443 --> 00:17:28,844
That was very embarrassing, Florenz,
very embarrassing.

161
00:17:29,003 --> 00:17:30,923
Don't get your dander up. Who knows?

162
00:17:31,124 --> 00:17:34,004
Maybe that little shower
will bring us oodles of luck.

163
00:17:34,164 --> 00:17:37,483
Well, I hope it brings us
so much business like that Little Egypt.

164
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:41,444
Look at those peoples, how they crowd
in to see that woman make wiggles...

165
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:46,203
...when yet they wouldn't come to see me
lift weights no other man in the world can.

166
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:49,763
Sandow, I'm afraid your trouble
is you developed the wrong muscles.

167
00:17:49,924 --> 00:17:53,803
What you say? Every muscle
in Sandow's body is developed...

168
00:17:53,963 --> 00:17:56,043
...even the toes, like that.

169
00:17:56,244 --> 00:18:00,163
With one arm I make a better dance
than that Little Egypt with the whole body.

170
00:18:00,323 --> 00:18:02,163
Look, boss.

171
00:18:06,883 --> 00:18:09,403
Good heavens!

172
00:18:11,803 --> 00:18:16,523
- Are you Mr. Sandow, the strongman?
- Yes, madam, this is the Great Sandow.

173
00:18:16,683 --> 00:18:19,643
Oh, look at those huge shoulders.
Aren't they marvelous?

174
00:18:19,803 --> 00:18:22,123
- Yes, dear, come on.
- And that big chest.

175
00:18:22,283 --> 00:18:25,003
- I never saw a chest like that before.
- Oh, come on.

176
00:18:25,163 --> 00:18:28,443
And his waistline, oh,
it's simply magnificent.

177
00:18:28,603 --> 00:18:30,843
- Precious, come on.
- Just a minute, dear.

178
00:18:31,003 --> 00:18:34,923
Mr. Sandow, I think your muscles
are simply astounding.

179
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:38,163
Perhaps madam would like
to feel the muscles of Sandow.

180
00:18:38,323 --> 00:18:42,923
- Oh, I'd love to.
- Sandow, your arm.

181
00:18:49,203 --> 00:18:52,683
- Florenz, is she dead?
- No, she's only fainted.

182
00:18:52,842 --> 00:18:56,883
- But, oh, what an idea. Come on!
- What? Wait a minute. What's wrong?

183
00:18:57,043 --> 00:18:59,923
- Where are you going?
- The papers. To the newspapers.

184
00:19:00,082 --> 00:19:02,722
I'll fill them so full,
women will fight to see you.

185
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:06,043
Not to watch you lift weights,
but simply to feel your muscles.

186
00:19:06,203 --> 00:19:08,803
Why, you've got more sex appeal
in your one arm...

187
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:10,922
...than Little Egypt has in her whole--

188
00:19:11,123 --> 00:19:15,363
Sandow, the modern Hercules.
The miracle of strength.

189
00:19:15,562 --> 00:19:21,723
Watch his muscles quiver
in musical rhythm. Sandow, quiver.

190
00:19:24,123 --> 00:19:25,882
Sufficient.

191
00:19:26,043 --> 00:19:29,962
And now, ladies, if you want
to see more of the Great Sandow...

192
00:19:30,163 --> 00:19:33,162
...if your hearts are strong enough
to stand the thrill...

193
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:36,522
...step up and buy your ticket.
The show starts in five minutes.

194
00:19:37,723 --> 00:19:41,042
- Folks, this is the show--
- How's business, Jack?

195
00:19:52,562 --> 00:19:54,282
All right?

196
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:58,442
- Doesn't it sparkle?
- Yes, doesn't it?

197
00:19:58,602 --> 00:20:01,962
- You like it?
- I certainly do.

198
00:20:02,162 --> 00:20:04,043
I'm glad.

199
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,122
- Dr. Ziegfeld.
- Yeah?

200
00:20:35,282 --> 00:20:39,522
Can't I play my piece for you now?
I get awful tired of this....

201
00:20:43,762 --> 00:20:46,642
I don't blame you, Mary Lou. So do I.

202
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:49,882
Go ahead, then.
Go on, play your little piece now.

203
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:57,602
- Dr. Ziegfeld?
- Yes, dear.

204
00:20:57,761 --> 00:21:00,482
- Do you know I was mad at your son?
- What?

205
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:04,162
Mad at your best fella?
Oh, but why?

206
00:21:04,322 --> 00:21:06,801
Because he left us for that old World's Fair.

207
00:21:07,122 --> 00:21:10,762
Oh, well, darling, you know
the fair closed yesterday.

208
00:21:10,962 --> 00:21:13,482
And is he coming back here again?

209
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,442
Well, I hope so.

210
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:20,521
Go on. You go on with your lesson.

211
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:28,081
- Dr. Ziegfeld.
- Yes, dear.

212
00:21:28,242 --> 00:21:31,722
Did you know I was
going to marry your son?

213
00:21:32,482 --> 00:21:34,682
Well, well, this is so sudden.

214
00:21:34,842 --> 00:21:38,761
- Are you?
- Oh, yes. We got that settled months ago.

215
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:42,721
Oh, yes, Father, didn't you know
Mary Lou and I are engaged?

216
00:21:45,481 --> 00:21:48,041
Well, don't I get a kiss today?

217
00:21:48,201 --> 00:21:50,602
Not even a smile?

218
00:21:50,801 --> 00:21:54,641
Well, Father, what do you think of that?
My future wife won't even kiss me...

219
00:21:54,801 --> 00:21:57,481
- ...and I brought her a present too.
- What?

220
00:21:57,641 --> 00:22:00,641
- Kiss first.
- No, present first.

221
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:05,402
No, kiss first. I'll tell you what. We'll both
give at the same time. How's that?

222
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:09,201
I'll count three. Ready? One.

223
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,241
- Two.
- Same time, remember.

224
00:22:12,402 --> 00:22:14,281
Three.

225
00:22:15,962 --> 00:22:18,801
Thank you so much.
Dr. Ziegfeld, isn't it lovely?

226
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:21,281
- Beautiful.
- I'm going to open it right now.

227
00:22:21,442 --> 00:22:26,321
- Right now. Yes.
- Oh, well, well, well.

228
00:22:26,481 --> 00:22:30,321
Well, Florenz, what have
you decided to do?

229
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:32,841
Well, I'm going to New York
tomorrow, Dad.

230
00:22:33,361 --> 00:22:36,201
With that Sandow, that strongman?

231
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:41,081
Father, I don't really belong here.
No, I don't like it.

232
00:22:41,241 --> 00:22:45,521
You don't like it, huh? The greatest
music conservatory in the country.

233
00:22:45,681 --> 00:22:49,400
I built it all myself. Students from
all over the world are coming here...

234
00:22:49,561 --> 00:22:53,161
...and you-- You don't like it.

235
00:22:53,361 --> 00:22:56,201
You realize that maybe somewhere
in one of these rooms...

236
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,400
...we find a future
Beethoven or Liszt?

237
00:22:59,601 --> 00:23:02,241
And you, my own son,
all you want is a circus.

238
00:23:02,401 --> 00:23:04,921
A circus with a fellow that can
throw cannonballs.

239
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:07,281
Well, now, Dad, don't be upset.

240
00:23:07,441 --> 00:23:11,521
- Sandow is a means to an end.
- Yeah, to your end.

241
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:15,881
When you was a little fellow, since then,
I've educated you in music and art.

242
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:19,521
From your mother, you got
the refinement, taste, culture.

243
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,160
What good has it all done?
What has it done you?

244
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,401
What are you now anyhow?
A muscle manager. A beef exhibitor.

245
00:23:27,601 --> 00:23:30,441
Then you got to go on the outside,
and you gotta be....

246
00:23:30,601 --> 00:23:33,441
You gotta act like a dog outside.
You act like a dog.

247
00:23:33,641 --> 00:23:35,720
Wait a minute,
what do you mean, a dog?

248
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,241
You know what I mean. I don't mean
you're a dog, I mean you got--

249
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,921
You gotta go outside and be a barker.
That's a dog, ain't it?

250
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,120
Now let me tell you something.
If you go away from here...

251
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,841
...I'll never speak to you again
as long as I live.

252
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,520
- Oh, Dad, you don't mean that.
- Yes, I do mean it.

253
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:55,241
And I mean-- I mean every word of it.

254
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,680
Hey, wait a minute here.

255
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,280
Now, you just stop that crying.

256
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,040
Now, you tell your fellow
why you're crying.

257
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,000
If you're my fellow,
why are you going away?

258
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,680
What--?

259
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,520
Now look here, you sit right up here,
and I'll tell you all about it.

260
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,600
Now, I'll be honest with you.

261
00:24:21,161 --> 00:24:27,201
- I'm not really your fellow.
- You mean you don't like me anymore?

262
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,081
I not only like you, I love you.

263
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,480
But you know, I'm the funniest kind
of a fellow. I love all the girls.

264
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,440
How can you do that?
Do they let you?

265
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,720
Well, you didn't quite understand
what I mean, darling.

266
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,480
Look....

267
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,480
Some people like beautiful paintings.

268
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,400
- Like that one?
- Like that one.

269
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,520
Some people love beautiful flowers.

270
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,920
- Like those?
- Like those.

271
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,560
Now, I love beautiful little girls
like this one.

272
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,680
- You know what I'm going to do someday?
- What?

273
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,359
I'm going to take all the beautiful
little girls like you...

274
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,280
...and I'm going to put them together
and make pictures with them.

275
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,240
- Will I be in a picture?
- Well, I should say you will.

276
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:19,320
But in the meantime, I think that
we ought to break our engagement.

277
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,120
- Why?
- Well, because...

278
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:24,440
...there are going to be lots of boys...

279
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,200
...who want to take you out
and buy you sodas.

280
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,800
If you're engaged to me,
you can't go with them.

281
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,640
- Why can't I?
- Because if you're married to me...

282
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,160
...I'm not going to have you running around
with other boys. I couldn't stand for that.

283
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:40,399
- You couldn't?
- Well, of course I couldn't.

284
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,120
- Well, what are you laughing at?
- At you, you're jealous.

285
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,719
Well, you can just bet I'm jealous.

286
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:51,999
Well, now I've got to run along.

287
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,879
Florenz.

288
00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:00,159
- Will you be home to dinner tonight?
- Yes, Dad.

289
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,759
Well, I'll see you then.

290
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:06,439
And in the meantime, son, remember:

291
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,520
Anything you do, I wish you luck.

292
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:11,919
I knew you would.

293
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:06,359
Hold it, Mr. Ziegfeld.

294
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:12,639
Thank you. Thank you.

295
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,479
Greetings. Greetings to San Francisco...

296
00:27:15,639 --> 00:27:21,519
...from my troupe, including the
strongest man in the world, Sandow.

297
00:27:31,878 --> 00:27:33,958
Humane Society?

298
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,598
Say, what's this I read in the papers
about a lion and a bear?

299
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:41,919
Is your society going
to tolerate such an atrocity?

300
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:47,159
Are you going to spill the blood of animals
over the good name of San Francisco?

301
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,559
Well, I didn't think
you'd permit such cruelty.

302
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:53,479
Why, it would be a crime
to send a poor grizzly bear...

303
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:56,838
...into a cage with
a man-eating lion. Crime.

304
00:28:35,638 --> 00:28:38,078
- What's so funny?
- Oh, you wouldn't understand...

305
00:28:38,238 --> 00:28:41,318
...because you don't know Ziegfeld.
Police are after him...

306
00:28:41,518 --> 00:28:45,118
...and this paper's two weeks old,
so he's probably in jail by now.

307
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,518
- But do you know him, Jack?
- Oh, yeah, he's a pal of mine.

308
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:00,678
Hello.

309
00:29:00,998 --> 00:29:05,078
- Well, Jack, this is a surprise.
- Yes.

310
00:29:05,238 --> 00:29:08,278
- Certainly glad to see you aboard.
- Yes, well, I'm glad I--

311
00:29:08,437 --> 00:29:12,398
Pardon me, I'll be back
in a few minutes, darling.

312
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:14,197
I thought perhaps you were--

313
00:29:14,358 --> 00:29:17,238
- Hey, who is she?
- You'll never know.

314
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:20,998
What happened in Frisco? Did you
really send Sandow in against a lion?

315
00:29:21,197 --> 00:29:22,918
Sure, but the lion wouldn't fight.

316
00:29:23,078 --> 00:29:24,438
Wouldn't or couldn't?

317
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:27,558
To tell you the truth, Jack,
I didn't stay for the finish.

318
00:29:27,757 --> 00:29:30,478
- I sort of thought that....
- Yes, I know.

319
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:32,998
Well, where is Sandow now?

320
00:29:33,158 --> 00:29:36,238
He's in New York.
He's going into the legitimate.

321
00:29:36,397 --> 00:29:40,678
<i>- He's with Lillian Russell in As You Like It.
- Yeah, well, I don't think I'd like it.</i>

322
00:29:40,878 --> 00:29:43,718
What are you going to Europe for,
another strongman?

323
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:46,277
Oh, no, no. Just a little vacation.

324
00:29:46,438 --> 00:29:48,717
- London?
- Well, Monte Carlo first.

325
00:29:48,877 --> 00:29:51,718
You're gonna lose all the money
you made on Sandow, huh?

326
00:29:51,877 --> 00:29:54,278
- No, I'm going to double it.
- Oh, yes.

327
00:29:54,477 --> 00:29:56,677
What are you going for,
another Little Egypt?

328
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:01,037
Oh, no, just a rest. Of course, if I see
any exceptional talent, I'll pick it up.

329
00:30:01,197 --> 00:30:03,237
Well, naturally. So will I.

330
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:05,717
Oh, you got anybody in mind?

331
00:30:05,877 --> 00:30:08,477
No, no. Why, have you?

332
00:30:08,637 --> 00:30:09,957
No, no.

333
00:30:10,117 --> 00:30:12,798
Only the greatest artist
in Europe, that's all.

334
00:30:12,957 --> 00:30:15,077
Say, who's that?

335
00:30:15,238 --> 00:30:18,757
If I told you, you'd cross me
before we crossed the ocean.

336
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,397
Beg pardon, sir.

337
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:24,557
Miss Carlisle wishes to know whether
there will be three for tea or just two.

338
00:30:24,718 --> 00:30:28,117
Just two. Yes, just two.

339
00:30:30,878 --> 00:30:33,638
- Miss Carlisle, huh?
- Yes, sir.

340
00:30:33,837 --> 00:30:35,398
Oh, thank you.

341
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:37,157
You're....

342
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,198
- You're Mr. Billings' man, are you?
- Yes, sir.

343
00:30:40,357 --> 00:30:42,997
Well, you're very efficient.

344
00:30:43,157 --> 00:30:44,797
- What is your name?
- Sidney, sir.

345
00:30:44,957 --> 00:30:47,557
Sidney. How much does
Mr. Billings pay you, Sidney?

346
00:30:47,757 --> 00:30:49,157
One hundred a month, sir.

347
00:30:49,357 --> 00:30:52,437
Only-- Well, that's not very much, is it?

348
00:30:52,597 --> 00:30:54,317
I hadn't thought of it, sir.

349
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:57,157
Well, think of it, Sidney.

350
00:31:06,157 --> 00:31:10,157
<i>London Evening News.
London Evening News.</i>

351
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:17,437
Oh, take care of the luggage, will you?
And tip the doorman, Sidney.

352
00:31:17,597 --> 00:31:19,237
Yes, sir.

353
00:31:24,237 --> 00:31:26,676
You have a reservation
for Florenz Ziegfeld Jr?

354
00:31:26,837 --> 00:31:30,157
- Yes, sir. Will you register, please?
- Surely.

355
00:31:31,277 --> 00:31:33,477
Is Mr. Billings still here?

356
00:31:33,677 --> 00:31:35,877
- Yes, sir, on your floor.
- Oh, yes.

357
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,517
Boy. Rooms 325 and 26.

358
00:31:40,157 --> 00:31:41,637
Thank you.

359
00:31:47,476 --> 00:31:50,477
Sidney. Well, you ingrate, you deserter--

360
00:31:50,636 --> 00:31:51,996
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

361
00:31:52,156 --> 00:31:54,957
Well, why didn't you tell me
you were dissatisfied? I--

362
00:31:55,117 --> 00:31:57,557
- You pirate.
- Now wait a minute, Jack.

363
00:31:57,717 --> 00:32:00,276
Gentlemen don't quarrel
over gentlemen's gentlemen.

364
00:32:00,437 --> 00:32:02,716
- Oh, you--
- Let me tell you the whole story.

365
00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:05,436
If you're still angry,
Sidney can go back with you.

366
00:32:05,596 --> 00:32:07,676
- Oh, I--
- Look, Jack, it was this way.

367
00:32:07,837 --> 00:32:12,556
I've always envied you.
Your dress, your style, the way you look.

368
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:15,356
So that when I saw your valet,
and I realized...

369
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:18,756
...that it was he who took
such magnificent care of you...

370
00:32:18,957 --> 00:32:23,757
...well, I just couldn't resist the temptation
of hiring him for myself.

371
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:25,996
You mean, you wanted to look like me?

372
00:32:26,156 --> 00:32:29,917
Well, that's right, Jack.
I wanted to look just like you.

373
00:32:30,477 --> 00:32:31,596
You faker.

374
00:32:31,756 --> 00:32:36,156
What are you doing here? I thought you
weren't going to be in London for weeks.

375
00:32:36,316 --> 00:32:38,676
Well, that's a long story.

376
00:32:38,837 --> 00:32:41,676
You know, I was going to break
the bank at Monte Carlo.

377
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:44,356
Yes, I know.
But the bank broke you, huh?

378
00:32:44,556 --> 00:32:46,956
- What did you lose?
- Fifty-thousand dollars.

379
00:32:48,236 --> 00:32:51,196
- What have you got left?
- Fifty cents.

380
00:32:51,356 --> 00:32:53,637
Fifty cents. Well, I'll see you later.

381
00:32:54,396 --> 00:32:56,636
But, Jack, wait a minute.

382
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,916
Lend me 5000, will you?

383
00:33:02,156 --> 00:33:03,756
Well, would you--?

384
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:05,076
Would you make it 2500?

385
00:33:05,236 --> 00:33:09,196
If I gave you $2500, by the time you
tipped six bellboys, you'd be broke again.

386
00:33:09,356 --> 00:33:11,356
Look, Jack, I really need it.

387
00:33:11,516 --> 00:33:12,476
I'll tell you what.

388
00:33:12,636 --> 00:33:16,196
I'll give you $500 if you'll catch
the next boat back to New York.

389
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:18,916
There's one leaving in the morning.
Fair enough?

390
00:33:19,116 --> 00:33:21,516
It's fair, but not enough.
Will you sail with me?

391
00:33:21,676 --> 00:33:24,076
Oh, no, Mr. Ziegfeld,
I have business in London.

392
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:26,836
Oh, haven't you got
the world's greatest artist yet?

393
00:33:26,996 --> 00:33:28,916
No, not yet, but I will have.

394
00:33:29,076 --> 00:33:30,516
Who is it, Jack?

395
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:33,036
Go on, you can tell me now. I'm broke.

396
00:33:33,196 --> 00:33:36,076
I won't tell you till I have
her name on the dotted line.

397
00:33:36,236 --> 00:33:37,796
It's a her, is it?

398
00:33:37,956 --> 00:33:41,956
Yes, and a beautiful her too,
and she's signing the contract tonight.

399
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:45,676
- Goodbye, Mr. Ziegfeld.
- Goodbye, Mr. Billings.

400
00:33:58,276 --> 00:34:00,716
I say, doorman,
did Mr. Billings come out?

401
00:34:00,876 --> 00:34:02,435
Just this moment drove away.

402
00:34:02,595 --> 00:34:04,716
I've got a very important message for him.

403
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:07,235
- Do you know where he went?
- Palace music hall.

404
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:09,756
- Is it a good show?
- Not so much, sir.

405
00:34:09,955 --> 00:34:12,595
Except for the French actress.
She's truly wonderful.

406
00:34:12,756 --> 00:34:14,115
She has eyes this big, sir.

407
00:34:14,316 --> 00:34:17,836
Every time she blinks them at you,
you jolly well blink yourself, sir.

408
00:34:17,996 --> 00:34:22,035
- Have you seen Anna Held, sir?
- No, no, I haven't, but I will tonight.

409
00:34:22,195 --> 00:34:23,316
Thank you, sir.

410
00:34:23,476 --> 00:34:25,635
I say, sir, do you realize you gave me £5?

411
00:34:25,796 --> 00:34:28,676
Yes, I'm trying to lose weight.

412
00:36:25,515 --> 00:36:27,234
Isn't it magnificent?

413
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:29,674
For me, Marie?

414
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:31,114
From whom?

415
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:34,234
Whoever gathered all the orchids
in the world just for me?

416
00:36:34,394 --> 00:36:37,234
I do not know, but they must've
cost thousands of francs.

417
00:36:37,394 --> 00:36:39,874
Was no card with it? Oh, yes.

418
00:36:41,234 --> 00:36:43,794
- Marie, this is very strange.
- What, madame?

419
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:48,034
I learned the English words, I sing the
English songs, yet I cannot read English.

420
00:36:48,234 --> 00:36:50,394
What shall that mean?
Please read it to me.

421
00:36:50,554 --> 00:36:54,234
"My dear Miss Held,
it is very important to your future...

422
00:36:54,394 --> 00:36:57,154
...that you see me
before signing any contracts.

423
00:36:57,595 --> 00:37:01,954
I shall be waiting at the stage entrance
immediately after your performance.

424
00:37:02,114 --> 00:37:04,354
Florenz Ziegfeld Jr."

425
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:07,474
- Who's this Florenz Ziegfeld Jr?
- I do not know, madame.

426
00:37:07,634 --> 00:37:11,714
- And why is it junior? Is he a little boy?
- I do not know, madame.

427
00:37:13,554 --> 00:37:16,434
I will not see this Mr. Ziegfeld Jr.

428
00:37:16,874 --> 00:37:19,394
<i>You will see Monsieur Billings, oui?</i>

429
00:37:21,914 --> 00:37:25,234
Oh, Marie, these flowers are very nice.

430
00:37:25,394 --> 00:37:29,634
I think I am polite and see this
Monsieur Junior Ziegfeld.

431
00:37:29,794 --> 00:37:33,274
But Billings is coming to talk to you
about the great American tour.

432
00:37:33,434 --> 00:37:35,074
Has madame forgotten his cables?

433
00:37:35,234 --> 00:37:40,154
Oh, yes, that's all right,
but these flowers are very beautiful.

434
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:45,153
Well, Jack, she's all right.

435
00:37:45,354 --> 00:37:47,473
Yeah, I know she is
without you telling me.

436
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:50,233
- I wish you wouldn't keep following me.
- All right.

437
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:53,634
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

438
00:37:54,714 --> 00:37:57,513
I wish you wouldn't annoy me.
Miss Held is expecting me.

439
00:37:57,674 --> 00:38:00,434
- I'm going to sign the contract tonight.
- That's great.

440
00:38:00,594 --> 00:38:02,594
- You bet it is.
- I said it was.

441
00:38:02,794 --> 00:38:06,034
- Yes, well, good night.
- Good night.

442
00:38:07,554 --> 00:38:09,194
Will you stop shadowing me?

443
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:12,593
I'm not following you.
I just happen to be going your way.

444
00:38:12,754 --> 00:38:15,193
You've got a date with a chorus girl,
I suppose.

445
00:38:15,354 --> 00:38:17,194
You're going to spend that $500.

446
00:38:17,353 --> 00:38:19,393
I can't spend it. I've spent it.

447
00:38:19,553 --> 00:38:22,754
- Oh, you've spent-- Well, good night.
- Good night.

448
00:38:23,714 --> 00:38:25,394
I beg your pardon, sir, but--

449
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:29,313
I have an appointment with Miss Held.

450
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,313
- Is Mr. Ziegfeld out here?
- Oh, no--

451
00:38:32,473 --> 00:38:34,274
Yes, my dear. I'm Mr. Ziegfeld.

452
00:38:34,473 --> 00:38:37,913
Mr. Ziegfeld, Miss Held
would like you to come in, please.

453
00:38:38,073 --> 00:38:39,873
Would you mind that for me?

454
00:38:40,074 --> 00:38:41,313
Well, good night, Jack.

455
00:38:41,993 --> 00:38:46,914
Oh, Mr. Ziegfeld, your orchids. They are
the most beautiful orchids I have ever seen.

456
00:38:52,114 --> 00:38:54,913
Won't you come in, Monsieur Ziegfeld?

457
00:38:59,953 --> 00:39:04,473
Your flowers are so beautiful. I could
not resist the temptation to thank you.

458
00:39:05,193 --> 00:39:07,713
Miss Held. Do you mind my telling you...

459
00:39:07,874 --> 00:39:11,433
...that you should never wear
so many jewels on your hands?

460
00:39:11,993 --> 00:39:14,353
- You think so?
- Some women, yes.

461
00:39:14,513 --> 00:39:15,993
But your hands, no.

462
00:39:17,673 --> 00:39:19,593
Oh, that's a very nice compliment.

463
00:39:19,753 --> 00:39:21,313
Did you hear that, Marie?

464
00:39:21,473 --> 00:39:23,473
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

465
00:39:23,633 --> 00:39:25,953
I did not know Americans
could be so gallant.

466
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,673
Tell me, Monsieur Ziegfeld,
are you in the theater?

467
00:39:28,873 --> 00:39:30,513
Yes, I'm a producer.

468
00:39:30,673 --> 00:39:34,113
Did you hear that, Marie?
Monsieur Ziegfeld is an American producer.

469
00:39:34,313 --> 00:39:36,673
Do you know Monsieur Billings?

470
00:39:37,993 --> 00:39:39,633
Billings?

471
00:39:40,513 --> 00:39:42,713
- Billings.
- He's American producer too.

472
00:39:42,873 --> 00:39:44,073
Oh, is that so?

473
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:45,913
- No, I've never heard of him.
- No?

474
00:39:46,073 --> 00:39:48,592
Of course, not in New York, that is.

475
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:49,952
America's a big country.

476
00:39:50,153 --> 00:39:53,633
We still have producers in the West
putting on shows for the Indians.

477
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:56,593
- Indians? Do you mean the savages?
- Yes.

478
00:39:56,753 --> 00:39:58,353
Did you hear that, Marie?

479
00:39:58,513 --> 00:40:01,752
- I do not think I will like America.
- Oh, you'll love New York.

480
00:40:01,913 --> 00:40:04,033
- Would New York love me?
- I think so.

481
00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:07,113
You only think so?
Did you not like my performance?

482
00:40:07,273 --> 00:40:09,353
Yes and no.

483
00:40:09,513 --> 00:40:13,433
- Yes and no. Does it mean yes or no?
- Well, both.

484
00:40:13,593 --> 00:40:15,753
- Did you not care for my singing, no?
- Yes.

485
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,113
A trifle nasal, I thought, but yes.

486
00:40:18,273 --> 00:40:20,313
And you did not like my costumes either?

487
00:40:20,473 --> 00:40:23,193
I thought one dress was
very effective, but the rest, no.

488
00:40:24,232 --> 00:40:27,112
Monsieur Ziegfeld,
I think you are very rude.

489
00:40:27,273 --> 00:40:28,953
Please go.

490
00:40:29,113 --> 00:40:31,232
Marie, open the door.

491
00:40:36,873 --> 00:40:38,912
Monsieur Ziegfeld.

492
00:40:40,152 --> 00:40:41,472
Yes?

493
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:43,552
Come back, please.

494
00:40:46,872 --> 00:40:48,512
Sit down.

495
00:40:51,592 --> 00:40:54,313
You know, you are very honest.

496
00:40:54,472 --> 00:40:56,872
I like you very much.

497
00:40:57,912 --> 00:41:01,592
Your note says it is important to my future
to see you. Why is that?

498
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:05,673
- If you want to play in New York, it is.
- I have many offers for New York now.

499
00:41:05,832 --> 00:41:07,873
I've no doubt, but so have many others.

500
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,672
There's foreign talent going
into New York every day.

501
00:41:10,832 --> 00:41:12,352
- What happens to them?
- What?

502
00:41:12,552 --> 00:41:16,152
Well, they open at Tony Pastor's theater,
and they get the hook.

503
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:17,512
The hook, what is that?

504
00:41:17,672 --> 00:41:21,312
Hook, a little thing you catch fish with.
You know, a hook.

505
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:25,432
Now, if I take you over,
I'll present you on Broadway.

506
00:41:25,592 --> 00:41:28,832
In a great show, in the best theater,
to the best people.

507
00:41:28,992 --> 00:41:30,912
I'll exploit you from coast to coast.

508
00:41:31,112 --> 00:41:32,752
Exploit? What is that?

509
00:41:32,912 --> 00:41:34,752
I'll put you over, I'll sell you.

510
00:41:34,952 --> 00:41:36,952
- Sell me?
- To the public.

511
00:41:37,112 --> 00:41:39,432
And I'll make them pay for you.

512
00:41:39,592 --> 00:41:42,072
And how much will you pay me?

513
00:41:42,232 --> 00:41:44,432
I'll advertise your name
from every corner.

514
00:41:44,592 --> 00:41:47,512
Women will be wearing Anna Held hats,
shoes, corsets.

515
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,312
Even the children will know you.

516
00:41:49,472 --> 00:41:51,232
But how much will you pay me?

517
00:41:51,392 --> 00:41:53,712
More publicity than
you've ever dreamed of.

518
00:41:53,872 --> 00:41:56,832
Yes, that's all right.
But how much money will you give me?

519
00:41:56,992 --> 00:42:00,392
I'll give you the greatest opening night
that New York has ever had.

520
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:03,111
You'll see the Goulds, the Astors,
the Vanderbilts.

521
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:05,872
"Diamond Jim" Brady, Lillian Russell.

522
00:42:06,032 --> 00:42:07,911
- Lillian Russell?
- Yes.

523
00:42:08,072 --> 00:42:10,791
- Oh, I would so much like to see her.
- Well.

524
00:42:10,952 --> 00:42:15,031
No. First you must speak about the money
because I have so many offers now.

525
00:42:15,191 --> 00:42:17,552
I'll meet your biggest offer.

526
00:42:17,712 --> 00:42:19,112
Really?

527
00:42:19,271 --> 00:42:21,871
Well, that is very nice of you.

528
00:42:22,031 --> 00:42:25,831
But maybe when you hear how much it is,
you don't think I'm worth so much.

529
00:42:25,991 --> 00:42:27,152
How much is it?

530
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:31,871
They are all very good, but the highest one
is that of Mr. Billings.

531
00:42:32,072 --> 00:42:36,391
He says he will give me 50,000 francs
besides my salary, which is very big...

532
00:42:36,551 --> 00:42:40,072
...just to sign the contract. That is
how much in American money?

533
00:42:40,231 --> 00:42:42,551
- $ 10,000, madame.
- $ 10,000, monsieur.

534
00:42:42,711 --> 00:42:46,031
<i>- Ten thousand dollars.
- Oui, that's a very big amount.</i>

535
00:42:46,192 --> 00:42:49,391
And even if you would give me
the $ 10,000 and I sign with you...

536
00:42:49,551 --> 00:42:52,991
...you still would have to wait
till I finished my London engagement.

537
00:42:53,192 --> 00:42:54,551
I couldn't do that.

538
00:42:54,712 --> 00:42:56,391
You couldn't even wait for me?

539
00:42:56,551 --> 00:42:58,471
I couldn't even give you the $ 10,000.

540
00:43:01,432 --> 00:43:04,511
- You think it's too much, huh?
- I think it isn't enough.

541
00:43:04,671 --> 00:43:06,232
But I haven't it.

542
00:43:07,071 --> 00:43:10,591
What, you expect I should sign a contract
for America with you...

543
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:14,312
- ...and you don't even have $ 10,000?
- I haven't even 1000.

544
00:43:14,471 --> 00:43:18,431
I did have before I stopped at Monte Carlo,
but right now, I haven't even 100.

545
00:43:18,591 --> 00:43:21,951
- But I'll spread your name all over--
- It is enough!

546
00:43:22,151 --> 00:43:24,271
You're just trying
to make the fool of me.

547
00:43:24,431 --> 00:43:27,231
You are the impostor.
You are no gentleman.

548
00:43:27,391 --> 00:43:28,831
Please go.

549
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:31,951
Marie, open the door.

550
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,191
Monsieur Ziegfeld.

551
00:43:46,031 --> 00:43:47,831
Come back, please.

552
00:43:51,351 --> 00:43:52,991
Sit down.

553
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:59,031
You know, you're very honest.

554
00:43:59,231 --> 00:44:01,671
I like you very much.

555
00:44:10,151 --> 00:44:13,110
Mr. Vanderbilt's carriage.
Mr. Van Rensselaer's carriage.

556
00:44:13,311 --> 00:44:16,511
- She has big eyes.
- But I couldn't understand a word she said.

557
00:44:16,711 --> 00:44:19,191
- I'll take Lillian Russell.
- Mr. Astor's carriage.

558
00:44:19,351 --> 00:44:22,191
- Did you like her?
- Cute. Did you notice the empty seats?

559
00:44:22,351 --> 00:44:23,670
Miss Russell's carriage.

560
00:44:23,831 --> 00:44:26,911
- I think she's charming.
- Why, there's Lillian Russell.

561
00:44:27,311 --> 00:44:28,791
Mr. Thaw's carriage.

562
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:31,190
Never mind, I don't want a carriage.

563
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:33,830
The show's all right
if they had an American star.

564
00:44:33,991 --> 00:44:38,070
Mrs. Harriman's carriage.
Mr. Stuyvesant's carriage.

565
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:39,791
You made a bad bet, Jim.

566
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:42,430
- May I have your carriage called, Mr. Brady?
- Yes.

567
00:44:42,631 --> 00:44:44,551
Oh, Ziggy.

568
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:47,110
Stanford and I just made a little wager.

569
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:50,591
He bet me 5000 that I wouldn't get back
the 10,000 you borrowed...

570
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,631
- ...to bring Anna over here.
- Mr. Brady's carriage.

571
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:56,231
I'll split your end 50-50
with you, Mr. White.

572
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:58,990
I told you so. I told you so.

573
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:02,030
Well, what's a few thousand
dollars anyway?

574
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:06,430
Mr. Chandler's carriage.
Mr. Saks' carriage.

575
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,550
Balcony 22.

576
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,510
Well, Sampston,
what's the loss this week?

577
00:45:12,671 --> 00:45:17,230
The show earned a profit of $ 1340.32.

578
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:20,390
You drew $2550...

579
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:25,350
...which gives us a loss of $ 1209.68.

580
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:28,510
That's terrible. We can't keep
the show running with losses.

581
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:30,190
- Say, where's Sage?
- Upstairs.

582
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:32,510
What a press agent, never around.

583
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:33,790
Take a wire to him.

584
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:37,630
- But he's just upstairs in his office.
- I know it. Take a wire anyway.

585
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:40,230
How can you do business
without publicity? Stop.

586
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:42,590
Anna Held was the sensation
of Europe. Stop.

587
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,630
Appeared before kings
and queens. Stop.

588
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:46,789
Yet you get nothing
in the papers. Stop.

589
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,190
You're ruining me. Stop.

590
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:50,790
If you're a press agent,
I'm President Cleveland.

591
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:53,310
Stop.
Beg your pardon.

592
00:46:11,749 --> 00:46:16,109
<i>Pardon, madame.
It is not jolie. It is jolly.</i>

593
00:46:16,269 --> 00:46:18,270
<i>Jolie, that's what I said, jolie.</i>

594
00:46:18,469 --> 00:46:20,830
<i>Pardon, it's my mistake. I mean jolly.</i>

595
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:22,870
Jolly. Good.

596
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:26,350
Please, let's start again. Jolly.

597
00:46:46,949 --> 00:46:50,470
No, no, no. I won't sing today.

598
00:46:50,629 --> 00:46:52,350
I can't sing today.

599
00:46:52,549 --> 00:46:55,629
I'm much too much inside here.

600
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:57,150
Much too much.

601
00:46:57,349 --> 00:46:58,789
Marie?

602
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:00,669
Marie.

603
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:03,709
It's so silly for Anna Held
to take singing lessons.

604
00:47:03,909 --> 00:47:06,070
But Ziegfeld did not ask me to teach you.

605
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:09,069
I simply want to help madame
to lose her French accent.

606
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:13,309
But your accent is much more than my
accent, and I don't want to lose my accent.

607
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:16,149
Marie, did you try to get
Monsieur Ziegfeld again?

608
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:18,709
- He is not home, madame.
- Please try it again.

609
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:21,669
- And the reporters?
- They are still in the lobby.

610
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:24,629
Tell them to go away.
Tell the hotel to push them out.

611
00:47:24,789 --> 00:47:27,789
Tell them we are going back to France.

612
00:47:29,709 --> 00:47:33,269
That's what we will do.
We are going back to Paris.

613
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:41,149
- Shut up, Pierre.
- I'm too happy, madame.

614
00:47:41,309 --> 00:47:44,709
- Happy about what?
- We are sailing for Paris.

615
00:47:45,549 --> 00:47:48,069
- No.
- No?

616
00:47:48,229 --> 00:47:50,789
No, I changed my mind.

617
00:47:50,949 --> 00:47:53,829
Marie, go unpack my things.

618
00:47:53,989 --> 00:47:55,949
- You see, it's true.
- It is not.

619
00:47:56,108 --> 00:47:57,829
- It is.
- No.

620
00:47:57,989 --> 00:48:00,189
What is true and what is not true?

621
00:48:00,389 --> 00:48:03,029
Pierre says madame is in love
with Monsieur Ziegfeld.

622
00:48:03,189 --> 00:48:05,109
Did you say that, Pierre?

623
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:08,829
- Why did you say that, Pierre?
- Because I'm afraid it's true.

624
00:48:09,029 --> 00:48:12,389
Why are you afraid?
Don't you like Monsieur Ziegfeld?

625
00:48:12,548 --> 00:48:14,188
<i>Oui, madame, that's the trouble.</i>

626
00:48:14,348 --> 00:48:16,668
Everybody likes him,
especially the ladies.

627
00:48:16,869 --> 00:48:19,268
Oh, madame, you'd never
be happy with him.

628
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:21,068
You'd never be able to hold him.

629
00:48:21,229 --> 00:48:24,068
Why, he attracts women
like the flowers attract bees.

630
00:48:24,229 --> 00:48:26,469
Like the flypaper attract the flies.

631
00:48:26,629 --> 00:48:29,909
Well, that's all right.
I've seen the flies on the flypaper...

632
00:48:30,069 --> 00:48:32,229
...and it seems to me
they stick very well.

633
00:48:32,389 --> 00:48:34,628
- But, madame--
- Pierre, please.

634
00:48:34,789 --> 00:48:38,949
How can I love someone who puts
terrible things in the newspaper...

635
00:48:39,109 --> 00:48:41,188
...has millions of reporters annoying me?

636
00:48:41,348 --> 00:48:44,549
Pardon, madame, but the newspapers
have been very nice to you.

637
00:48:44,709 --> 00:48:46,749
Why don't you want to see the reporters?

638
00:48:46,948 --> 00:48:49,349
Because I know exactly
what they want to ask me.

639
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:53,668
- You do not understand, no?
- Frankly, no, madame.

640
00:48:53,828 --> 00:48:56,668
Oh, then I will tell you what happened.

641
00:48:56,828 --> 00:48:58,868
Two months ago,
Monsieur Ziegfeld says:

642
00:48:59,028 --> 00:49:02,468
"Anna, from now on, I'm going
to send you, every day, a big present."

643
00:49:02,629 --> 00:49:05,068
I say, "Thank you so much, Flo--"

644
00:49:05,228 --> 00:49:07,309
I mean, "Mr. Ziegfeld.

645
00:49:07,468 --> 00:49:09,868
But already you send me orchids
every morning."

646
00:49:10,028 --> 00:49:11,269
Those are from him.

647
00:49:11,429 --> 00:49:14,589
But he says, "No, Anna, this is something
much more important."

648
00:49:14,788 --> 00:49:18,588
So naturally, I cannot wait to see
what he sends me.

649
00:49:18,788 --> 00:49:22,148
And the next day,
what do you think I get?

650
00:49:22,308 --> 00:49:24,068
- A diamond ring?
- No.

651
00:49:24,228 --> 00:49:29,028
- A bracelet?
- No. Four big cans of milk.

652
00:49:29,188 --> 00:49:31,429
- Milk.
- Twenty gallons.

653
00:49:31,588 --> 00:49:35,908
- Twenty gallons of milk?
- Twenty gallons of milk.

654
00:49:40,588 --> 00:49:43,868
- Shut up!
- Twenty gallons of milk.

655
00:49:47,108 --> 00:49:48,548
- Oh, please.
- No.

656
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:52,548
I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

657
00:49:53,188 --> 00:49:57,908
Well, that night I say to Flo--
I mean, Mr. Ziegfeld:

658
00:49:58,068 --> 00:50:00,068
"Flo, why do you send me
so much milk?"

659
00:50:00,228 --> 00:50:03,068
And he just laughs and says,
"Anna, that's a great idea.

660
00:50:03,227 --> 00:50:06,548
You get it from now on every day."
"Every day, 20 gallons of milk?"

661
00:50:06,748 --> 00:50:11,028
I say, "Flo, who can drink so much milk?"
And do you know what he says?

662
00:50:11,187 --> 00:50:14,988
"Don't drink it, bathe in it.
And you will be a big success."

663
00:50:15,147 --> 00:50:18,228
- No!
- Well, I'm too angry to speak.

664
00:50:18,388 --> 00:50:21,268
In Paris, I was a big success
because they liked my voice.

665
00:50:21,467 --> 00:50:24,067
In London,
because they liked my singing.

666
00:50:24,228 --> 00:50:29,147
But in America, to be a big success,
I need 20 gallons of milk and must sit in it!

667
00:50:29,348 --> 00:50:32,628
- Well, do you bathe in it, madame?
- No, of course not.

668
00:50:32,827 --> 00:50:35,388
But every day, we get the milk
and take it in...

669
00:50:35,587 --> 00:50:38,628
...because Monsieur Ziegfeld says
we must carry out his idea.

670
00:50:38,788 --> 00:50:41,627
And what happened?
Did you read this morning, the paper?

671
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,308
- No, madame.
- Please.

672
00:50:43,468 --> 00:50:47,188
- "Ziegfeld is sued for Anna Held's milk bill."
- On the front page.

673
00:50:47,347 --> 00:50:50,868
- Twenty gallons of milk.
- Oh, I'm so ashamed.

674
00:50:51,028 --> 00:50:52,947
Marie, please call him again.

675
00:50:53,507 --> 00:50:55,388
If he's not there, leave the message.

676
00:50:55,548 --> 00:50:58,467
Tell him I do not want
one can more of milk from him.

677
00:50:58,627 --> 00:51:01,388
And I don't want the orchids either.

678
00:51:01,548 --> 00:51:03,308
- Hello?
- Oh, those reporters again.

679
00:51:03,468 --> 00:51:05,747
Tell them no.
I do not want to speak to them.

680
00:51:05,907 --> 00:51:08,187
Madame, it is Monsieur Ziegfeld.

681
00:51:08,787 --> 00:51:13,107
I don't want to speak to him either.
I never wish to speak to him again.

682
00:51:14,148 --> 00:51:15,388
Where is he?

683
00:51:15,548 --> 00:51:17,627
Downstairs in the lobby, madame.

684
00:51:17,787 --> 00:51:19,628
Tell him to come up.

685
00:51:19,788 --> 00:51:22,947
But if he brings one of those reporters,
don't let him in.

686
00:51:23,107 --> 00:51:26,307
No, Pierre. Let them on the floor.
I want him to see them there.

687
00:51:26,467 --> 00:51:29,788
I make him pick them up.
He embarrasses me, I embarrass him.

688
00:51:29,987 --> 00:51:34,308
Madame, if you will take my advice,
you will not appear so excited.

689
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:36,187
Yes, you are right, Pierre.

690
00:51:36,347 --> 00:51:39,587
Pierre, play. Play. I sing for you, yes.
Just like he's not here.

691
00:51:39,747 --> 00:51:43,347
We'll let him wait till I'm finished.
Come on, play, play, play.

692
00:51:58,147 --> 00:52:02,787
<i>- Your missus is in lovely voice today, Marie.
- Oui, monsieur. You will see.</i>

693
00:52:05,227 --> 00:52:08,867
Marie, someone has apparently
spilled the orchids.

694
00:52:09,027 --> 00:52:13,427
Now, will you phone Sidney for me? Have
him send up another dozen immediately.

695
00:52:15,146 --> 00:52:18,586
Well? Why do you not pick these up?

696
00:52:19,907 --> 00:52:23,226
Because fallen flowers, my dear,
are like fallen stars.

697
00:52:23,386 --> 00:52:25,787
They soon lose their luster.

698
00:52:26,587 --> 00:52:28,467
Marie, pick them up.

699
00:52:29,266 --> 00:52:32,266
No, I cannot sing today.
I'm much too angry to sing.

700
00:52:32,426 --> 00:52:34,906
I'm sick of watching you
roll your eyes like I do.

701
00:52:35,107 --> 00:52:37,147
Please go home. I give you your notes.

702
00:52:37,307 --> 00:52:39,867
Please take them. Go home, yes?

703
00:52:40,226 --> 00:52:41,667
Go.

704
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:46,587
So I'm a fallen star, yes?
I have no luster, no?

705
00:52:46,786 --> 00:52:48,507
Oh, yes, you have, my dear.

706
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:51,707
- But do you know what it comes from?
- I don't care.

707
00:52:51,866 --> 00:52:53,067
What?

708
00:52:53,226 --> 00:52:56,426
Milk baths. Or at least that's what
you must tell the reporters.

709
00:52:56,587 --> 00:53:00,946
I'm so hurt. The front page of the paper
says you are sued on my account.

710
00:53:01,107 --> 00:53:03,226
If you send milk,
why don't you pay for it?

711
00:53:03,426 --> 00:53:05,387
If I did, it wouldn't be in the papers.

712
00:53:05,547 --> 00:53:09,986
Can't you tell them I just used the milk
without buying it and being sued for it?

713
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:12,986
They wouldn't believe it.
Now it's a matter of record.

714
00:53:13,146 --> 00:53:15,947
Besides, they don't care
whether I ever pay the bill.

715
00:53:16,106 --> 00:53:20,626
All that interests them is that in two
months, you've used 1200 gallons of milk.

716
00:53:20,786 --> 00:53:22,387
<i>This is terrible.</i>

717
00:53:22,546 --> 00:53:25,426
- Ask the reporters to come up.
- Do nothing of the kind.

718
00:53:25,626 --> 00:53:27,626
Anna, you must not insult the press.

719
00:53:27,786 --> 00:53:29,787
If they come up, I tell the truth.

720
00:53:29,986 --> 00:53:31,746
No, at first, tell them nothing.

721
00:53:31,906 --> 00:53:33,347
Desk, please.

722
00:53:33,506 --> 00:53:34,666
Pretend embarrassment.

723
00:53:34,826 --> 00:53:37,546
Pretend it? I was never so ashamed.

724
00:53:37,706 --> 00:53:40,986
Are the gentlemen of the press
still waiting for Miss Held?

725
00:53:41,186 --> 00:53:43,106
What are you doing?

726
00:53:43,266 --> 00:53:45,106
Oh, yes, if you will, please.

727
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:48,346
I will say I never in my life
took a milk bath.

728
00:53:48,506 --> 00:53:51,586
I will tell them it is all a press story.

729
00:53:52,706 --> 00:53:54,306
I will go back to France.

730
00:53:54,466 --> 00:53:57,106
Marie, pack the things. Quick.

731
00:53:57,266 --> 00:53:59,426
This time I mean it!

732
00:54:01,946 --> 00:54:03,506
You cannot make a circus of me.

733
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:06,066
I'm not a strongman like Sandow.

734
00:54:06,226 --> 00:54:09,346
I'm a real artist,
and I never, never, never will say that.

735
00:54:09,506 --> 00:54:12,346
Yes? Oh, ask them
to come right up, please.

736
00:54:12,506 --> 00:54:13,426
No!

737
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:16,746
Anna, don't you realize
that if we put this story over...

738
00:54:16,906 --> 00:54:19,746
...your name will be in headlines
from coast to coast?

739
00:54:19,906 --> 00:54:22,586
Every woman in the country will be
talking about you.

740
00:54:22,746 --> 00:54:24,266
I don't care.

741
00:54:24,426 --> 00:54:27,786
I do not have to be a cow
to be a success.

742
00:54:28,305 --> 00:54:33,306
And before I make such a fool of myself,
I tear up my contract with you. So...

743
00:54:34,185 --> 00:54:36,066
...where is it?

744
00:54:38,985 --> 00:54:42,106
And besides-- Besides--

745
00:54:42,265 --> 00:54:45,266
And besides, you do nothing
as I like to have it.

746
00:54:45,425 --> 00:54:47,026
It must always be your way.

747
00:54:47,186 --> 00:54:50,105
I ask you 1000 times
to have costumes like Lillian Russell.

748
00:54:50,306 --> 00:54:53,545
She has not to take milk baths
to be a success. She is beautiful.

749
00:54:53,706 --> 00:54:56,986
But, no, I cannot have gowns like her.
There now.

750
00:54:57,186 --> 00:54:59,705
Tell the reporters about that!

751
00:55:03,225 --> 00:55:06,945
- Anna.
- I mean it. I'm determined.

752
00:55:10,986 --> 00:55:12,425
Anna.

753
00:55:12,585 --> 00:55:17,105
You let the reporters come up, yes?
All right, I tell them everything.

754
00:55:20,425 --> 00:55:21,785
Anna?

755
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:26,906
Well, I should tell them, no?

756
00:55:31,185 --> 00:55:32,705
No.

757
00:55:37,785 --> 00:55:40,066
Now, you do what I ask you to, darling...

758
00:55:40,345 --> 00:55:42,945
...and I'll do whatever you wish.

759
00:55:43,265 --> 00:55:46,506
You mean, you'll let me have
gowns like Lillian Russell?

760
00:55:46,665 --> 00:55:51,905
Oh, no, darling.
You're not her type.

761
00:55:52,145 --> 00:55:54,945
- But I'll tell you what I will do.
- What?

762
00:55:55,225 --> 00:55:59,705
I'll put eight Lillian Russells
on the stage behind you.

763
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:43,104
Isn't Anna beautiful?

764
00:56:43,265 --> 00:56:46,264
I wonder if the milk baths
really make her skin so nice.

765
00:56:46,465 --> 00:56:50,624
Oh, they most certainly do.
I've been taking them for a long time.

766
00:57:20,185 --> 00:57:22,744
Oh, Marie, were they not
wonderful tonight?

767
00:57:22,944 --> 00:57:25,904
And the girls!
Don't they look gorgeous?

768
00:57:28,184 --> 00:57:29,704
Marie.

769
00:57:30,024 --> 00:57:33,625
Look. From my Flo.

770
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:36,304
Oh, my Flo.

771
00:57:36,784 --> 00:57:39,225
Oh, Marie! Marie!
You read what he says.

772
00:57:39,424 --> 00:57:40,865
<i>Oui, madame.</i>

773
00:57:41,425 --> 00:57:43,345
Read it to me, quick!

774
00:57:43,504 --> 00:57:45,224
What does it say?

775
00:57:46,144 --> 00:57:48,024
"My darling.

776
00:57:48,224 --> 00:57:53,464
I never knew that one long year
could seem like one short moment.

777
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:57,784
You are magnificent, my wife. Flo."

778
00:58:00,065 --> 00:58:01,985
Oh, Marie.

779
00:58:03,264 --> 00:58:05,824
- Marie, did you hear that?
- I just read it, madame.

780
00:58:05,984 --> 00:58:08,184
No, no. Did you hear what he says?

781
00:58:08,344 --> 00:58:12,064
"You are magnificent, my wife."

782
00:58:12,704 --> 00:58:15,224
Oh, madame, look! Look!

783
00:58:22,584 --> 00:58:24,463
Marie!

784
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:28,023
Come on, help me.

785
00:58:29,984 --> 00:58:31,984
Oh, isn't it gorgeous?

786
00:58:32,184 --> 00:58:35,464
Oh, madame, look, look!
Here's another one!

787
00:58:37,104 --> 00:58:39,383
Oh, Marie!

788
00:58:40,944 --> 00:58:44,904
Oh, that makes me
so much inside. Here.

789
00:58:45,344 --> 00:58:47,304
Much too much.

790
00:58:51,224 --> 00:58:53,984
First, he gives me all
the flowers in the world...

791
00:58:54,144 --> 00:58:58,904
...and now he takes the stars
from the heavens, just for me.

792
00:59:00,824 --> 00:59:03,864
"You're magnificent, my wife."

793
00:59:04,544 --> 00:59:07,584
<i>- Am I magnificent, Marie?
- Oui, madame.</i>

794
00:59:07,743 --> 00:59:11,704
No, no, no.
He's magnificent, not I.

795
00:59:12,023 --> 00:59:13,263
Marie!

796
00:59:13,704 --> 00:59:15,784
Marie, I must show them to the girls!

797
00:59:16,224 --> 00:59:17,503
I come back immediately!

798
00:59:17,663 --> 00:59:21,463
And when Mr. Ziegfeld comes,
please tell him he shall wait!

799
00:59:22,463 --> 00:59:24,903
Girls, would you like to see
something wonderful?

800
00:59:25,063 --> 00:59:26,344
Oh, what is it?

801
00:59:26,504 --> 00:59:27,984
- Look! And this!
- Diamonds!

802
00:59:28,144 --> 00:59:30,223
- From my husband!
- May I try the bracelet?

803
00:59:30,383 --> 00:59:33,903
- Yes, sure.
- That's gorgeous.

804
00:59:35,343 --> 00:59:39,383
Audrey, are you not interested
in my presents?

805
00:59:39,543 --> 00:59:43,023
I would be if they were mine.

806
00:59:43,624 --> 00:59:46,504
But, Audrey, you will have
many of them someday.

807
00:59:46,663 --> 00:59:50,744
Maybe you have to work a little,
to suffer a little.

808
00:59:50,903 --> 00:59:55,183
- But what is that?
- I'll work, but I won't suffer.

809
00:59:55,343 --> 00:59:56,943
- Here you are, dear.
- Thank you.

810
00:59:57,103 --> 00:59:58,863
Isn't it beautiful, Audrey?

811
00:59:59,023 --> 01:00:03,063
I'll say it is.
I'd give my soul for one like it.

812
01:00:03,223 --> 01:00:06,543
That would be a very
bad bargain, Audrey.

813
01:00:07,343 --> 01:00:09,983
All right, that's fine! Tie it off!

814
01:00:36,263 --> 01:00:38,503
You're better with your feet
than your broom.

815
01:00:38,663 --> 01:00:40,902
Mr. Ziegfeld, you think so?

816
01:00:41,063 --> 01:00:43,382
I wish you'd give me a chance.
I've got talent.

817
01:00:43,543 --> 01:00:46,543
I'd like to get away from shifting
scenery and moving props.

818
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:51,223
- How long have you been a property boy?
- Five years. But my heart hasn't been in it.

819
01:00:51,383 --> 01:00:53,942
You've been working a long time
without your heart.

820
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:56,343
- That tickle you?
- It does.

821
01:00:56,503 --> 01:01:00,543
And this weekly return tickles me more.
Look, a profit of $5000.

822
01:01:00,703 --> 01:01:03,583
If you'll just be conservative,
I mean, live reasonably.

823
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:07,183
Don't incur any fresh obligations,
forget you have charge accounts...

824
01:01:07,382 --> 01:01:09,142
- ...and you'll soon--
- You're right.

825
01:01:09,302 --> 01:01:11,342
- I will.
- Darling!

826
01:01:11,622 --> 01:01:13,423
Oh, Anna.

827
01:01:13,942 --> 01:01:15,383
Anna.

828
01:01:17,502 --> 01:01:20,782
You're the sweetest husband
in the whole world.

829
01:01:22,542 --> 01:01:24,382
Mr. Sampston!

830
01:01:25,302 --> 01:01:26,582
Look.

831
01:01:27,502 --> 01:01:30,342
From my husband.
On our anniversary.

832
01:01:30,502 --> 01:01:33,262
This and this.
Are they not gorgeous diamonds?

833
01:01:33,422 --> 01:01:35,862
Yes, indeed, Miss Held, gorgeous.

834
01:01:36,382 --> 01:01:38,302
Good night, Mr. Ziegfeld.

835
01:01:38,702 --> 01:01:40,422
Good night, Sampston.

836
01:01:41,062 --> 01:01:43,822
<i>He didn't seem very happy
about my presents, oui?</i>

837
01:01:43,982 --> 01:01:47,742
Anna, men who keep books
are never very happy.

838
01:01:49,742 --> 01:01:54,303
Marie, you go out for a while.
He is my maid tonight. Go, go, go, go.

839
01:01:54,462 --> 01:01:57,542
- Oh, I am, am I?
- Yes, you are.

840
01:01:58,062 --> 01:02:02,862
Later, I count the diamonds in the bracelet
and necklace and kiss you for each one.

841
01:02:03,062 --> 01:02:05,782
What about the orchids?
Don't I get anything for them?

842
01:02:07,622 --> 01:02:12,182
For each petal of each orchid,
another kiss extra. So....

843
01:02:14,862 --> 01:02:16,782
Take off my stocking, please.

844
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:18,942
You know, this might get to be a habit.

845
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:22,582
Flo, you're wonderful.
Do you know that?

846
01:02:23,342 --> 01:02:24,702
I suspect it.

847
01:02:24,861 --> 01:02:26,742
Everything you promise me, you do.

848
01:02:27,142 --> 01:02:29,782
Everything you say will happen, happens.

849
01:02:29,942 --> 01:02:33,462
And now I am a big success
in America, thanks to you.

850
01:02:35,062 --> 01:02:36,262
Flo!

851
01:02:36,422 --> 01:02:40,302
Why do you do that when I am
trying to say nice things to you?

852
01:02:40,542 --> 01:02:43,142
Besides, you're
a very bad mate.

853
01:02:43,382 --> 01:02:45,262
But I love you.

854
01:02:47,782 --> 01:02:49,862
- Flo?
- What?

855
01:02:50,022 --> 01:02:52,862
Flo, are you as happy as I am?

856
01:02:53,022 --> 01:02:55,581
Happier. Why do you ask?

857
01:02:55,742 --> 01:02:58,262
Because sometimes
I think I am too happy.

858
01:02:58,421 --> 01:03:01,622
Sometimes I get afraid
it won't be always like this...

859
01:03:01,782 --> 01:03:06,022
...working only for you
while you do the show just for me.

860
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:08,622
Couldn't I do another show
without spoiling our happiness?

861
01:03:08,782 --> 01:03:11,382
Of course you could. Don't be silly.

862
01:03:14,262 --> 01:03:16,502
Do you want to do another show?

863
01:03:17,142 --> 01:03:21,901
Well, darling, now that you've
made such a tremendous success...

864
01:03:22,102 --> 01:03:25,181
...I have a little idea
that I'd like to carry out.

865
01:03:25,341 --> 01:03:26,902
Idea for a show?

866
01:03:27,101 --> 01:03:30,742
- The biggest kind of a show.
- With music and girls?

867
01:03:30,941 --> 01:03:35,102
<i>- Beautiful girls and--
- And without me, oui?</i>

868
01:03:35,461 --> 01:03:39,021
Well, darling, you couldn't do
two shows at once, could you?

869
01:03:42,621 --> 01:03:44,901
Now, Anna, see here.

870
01:03:45,061 --> 01:03:48,142
Suppose we go down to Rector's
and celebrate our anniversary?

871
01:03:48,301 --> 01:03:50,582
- No, I don't--
- Just us and a bottle of wine.

872
01:03:50,742 --> 01:03:53,221
- I don't feel like it.
- Come on, now, dear.

873
01:03:53,381 --> 01:03:55,662
- No, I'm so nervous.
- It'll be good for you.

874
01:03:55,821 --> 01:03:57,061
I'm so tired.

875
01:03:57,501 --> 01:04:00,941
I'm so disappointed in you
I could scream!

876
01:04:01,101 --> 01:04:02,901
- Now, Anna--
- I mean it.

877
01:04:03,062 --> 01:04:05,781
I thought you loved me more
than anything in the world.

878
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:08,701
I thought I am your one ideal,
your only ambition.

879
01:04:08,861 --> 01:04:10,301
- Anna--
- No.

880
01:04:10,461 --> 01:04:13,781
I think only of you, and I thought
you will only think of me.

881
01:04:13,941 --> 01:04:16,301
But it is not so.
You have big plans without me.

882
01:04:16,502 --> 01:04:19,781
You will do a big show.
You will go broke again!

883
01:04:19,941 --> 01:04:23,061
Anna, you're jealous.

884
01:04:23,221 --> 01:04:24,181
- No, Flo!
- Yes.

885
01:04:24,341 --> 01:04:25,941
Don't say that, no, no, no!

886
01:04:26,101 --> 01:04:30,181
I hate jealous people,
and I don't know what's....

887
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:34,701
I'm angry, and I wish you would go.
Please, please.

888
01:04:34,901 --> 01:04:38,221
Please go. Go! Go!

889
01:04:45,301 --> 01:04:47,181
Marie!

890
01:04:48,221 --> 01:04:49,621
Marie.

891
01:04:56,501 --> 01:04:58,020
Flo.

892
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:09,101
- Good morning, Mr. Billings.
- Good morning, Miss Drake. Messages?

893
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:12,341
Nothing important, except Mr. Erlanger
wants to see you today.

894
01:05:12,501 --> 01:05:14,101
Mr. Ziegfeld is in your office.

895
01:05:14,261 --> 01:05:16,660
Well, why in my office
instead of out here?

896
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:19,061
I thought he'd be more
comfortable in there.

897
01:05:19,221 --> 01:05:22,061
Well, I-- Oh yes, I see.

898
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:35,420
To what do I owe the honor
of this visit, Mr. Ziegfeld?

899
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:41,541
Mr. Billings, if you've ever had it in for me,
you've certainly avenged yourself.

900
01:05:41,701 --> 01:05:45,820
This is positively the worst cigar I've ever
smoked in my life. How are you, Jack?

901
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:48,780
- All right. How are you?
- Never better. Sit, won't you?

902
01:05:48,941 --> 01:05:50,780
Thank you. Nice of you.

903
01:05:51,261 --> 01:05:52,941
I'm here to do you a great favor.

904
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:56,221
I'm sorry, I can't take advantage of it.
I'm broke.

905
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:58,300
That's why I'm hooked up
with Erlanger.

906
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:01,780
Oh, well, that's fine for me.
He's just the man I need.

907
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:04,981
Jack, I want to do a new show,
a big show.

908
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:09,781
I'm willing to split it 50-50 with Erlanger,
and all he has to do is put up the money...

909
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:12,860
- ...and furnish the theaters.
- Oh, that's all?

910
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:14,540
That's all.

911
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:18,500
Of course, you'd furnish the star.

912
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:21,060
Oh, this isn't for Anna.
Anna's show is all set.

913
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,540
No, in this one...

914
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:26,580
- ...I want to star the girls.
- Don't be ridiculous.

915
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:29,100
Without personalities,
you haven't got a chance.

916
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,780
I'll have personalities, all right,
Iots of them.

917
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:34,740
But they'll mostly be
blonds and brunettes.

918
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,820
What are you going to call this opera?

919
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,780
<i>I'm going to call it
the Ziegfeld Follies.</i>

920
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:42,100
Follies. Follies, all right.

921
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:44,660
What's the matter?
That's a good title.

922
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:48,100
What's so unusual about a girl show?
We've got plenty now.

923
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:50,660
I don't mean that kind.
They're way out-of-date.

924
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:54,900
You're using the same scenery you used
20 years ago, wood wings and flats.

925
01:06:55,060 --> 01:07:00,460
I want to do a show with silk drapes,
with lace, with beautiful girls.

926
01:07:00,619 --> 01:07:02,900
I won't dress them
for the men in the front...

927
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,780
...but for the women in the back.

928
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:09,100
I want to surround them with
glamour, glitter. Glorify them.

929
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:12,419
Say....

930
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:15,979
There's a good word, Jack. "Glorify."

931
01:07:16,139 --> 01:07:18,299
Sounds all right
if you know what it means.

932
01:07:18,459 --> 01:07:20,540
It'll look all right too.

933
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,859
"Glorifying the American Girl."

934
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:25,260
Where you gonna find
these beautiful girls?

935
01:07:25,459 --> 01:07:28,940
I'll take them from homes,
from stores, from shops--

936
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:31,700
From offices.

937
01:07:31,859 --> 01:07:34,820
I beg your pardon.
Mr. Erlanger would like to see you now.

938
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:36,659
Oh, all right.

939
01:07:37,739 --> 01:07:41,179
- Yes, well, that'll do, Miss Drake.
- Yes, sir.

940
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:45,780
Now, listen, Ziggy, not her.
She's the best stenographer I ever had.

941
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:48,499
- All right, Jack.
- Here, here.

942
01:07:48,859 --> 01:07:51,420
- You will buzz the little giant?
- I'll tell him...

943
01:07:51,579 --> 01:07:55,179
- ...but I doubt he'll be interested.
- He's missing a great opportunity.

944
01:07:55,339 --> 01:07:56,299
Yes, I know.

945
01:07:56,459 --> 01:07:59,659
But, well, I'll drop you a line about it.
Perhaps tomorrow.

946
01:07:59,819 --> 01:08:00,779
Wire me, will you?

947
01:08:00,939 --> 01:08:04,539
Well, if you'd rather hear
the sad news sooner, I'll wire.

948
01:08:05,419 --> 01:08:06,739
Yes.

949
01:08:08,579 --> 01:08:11,859
What's that? They won't give us
our share of the profits?

950
01:08:12,019 --> 01:08:14,059
All right! Open him in Boston...

951
01:08:14,259 --> 01:08:16,779
...jump him to New Orleans,
and then on to Frisco.

952
01:08:18,379 --> 01:08:21,619
Funny thing, Billings.
You just can't be nice to some people.

953
01:08:21,779 --> 01:08:24,819
Yes, that's what I was thinking.
Ziegfeld was just here.

954
01:08:24,979 --> 01:08:25,979
What did he want?

955
01:08:26,139 --> 01:08:29,059
Remember when he stole Anna Held
right from under my nose?

956
01:08:29,219 --> 01:08:33,099
Then, so I couldn't get her back,
he married her and made enough to retire.

957
01:08:33,259 --> 01:08:34,939
Now he comes back, broke again...

958
01:08:35,099 --> 01:08:38,059
...asking me to ask you for the money
to put on a new show!

959
01:08:38,219 --> 01:08:41,779
Well, that's nerve.
What do you want me to do?

960
01:08:42,499 --> 01:08:43,499
Give him the money.

961
01:08:52,818 --> 01:08:55,059
- Cantor and Will Rogers!
- $50 a pair!

962
01:08:55,219 --> 01:08:58,059
- Best show in town!
- Tickets, boys? And gentlemen?

963
01:09:07,539 --> 01:09:08,978
Standing room only.

964
01:10:36,818 --> 01:10:40,218
Come on, girls, come on, come on!
Get up those steps! Come on!

965
01:10:41,098 --> 01:10:42,818
You realize this is opening night?

966
01:10:42,978 --> 01:10:45,618
You take that brace and put it down here!
What is it?

967
01:10:45,778 --> 01:10:48,978
I've only got two minutes.
You ready to go in with those steps?

968
01:10:49,138 --> 01:10:52,458
I've built so many steps for Ziegfeld,
they go in by themselves.

969
01:10:52,818 --> 01:10:54,457
- What follows this number?
- The--

970
01:10:54,618 --> 01:10:57,458
I know, Greg Williams.
Have the finale costumes arrived?

971
01:10:57,618 --> 01:10:59,738
Mr. Sampston's talking
to the costumer now.

972
01:10:59,898 --> 01:11:02,378
Oh, I see. Trouble again.

973
01:11:02,537 --> 01:11:04,978
You can't do this!
It's an unheard-of procedure!

974
01:11:05,137 --> 01:11:07,698
I'm very sorry, Mr. Sampston,
I want my money.

975
01:11:07,858 --> 01:11:09,418
It's preposterous! Ridiculous!

976
01:11:09,578 --> 01:11:13,978
- No money, no finale costumes.
- It's a holdup! Oh, hello.

977
01:11:14,138 --> 01:11:17,458
You can't do this to Mr. Ziegfeld.
Wait here a minute.

978
01:11:17,617 --> 01:11:19,018
- Allen!
- Yes, sir.

979
01:11:19,178 --> 01:11:21,737
- Where's Ziegfeld?
- Haven't seen him in 10 minutes.

980
01:11:21,898 --> 01:11:23,698
- See if he's in the front.
- Yes, sir.

981
01:11:23,858 --> 01:11:25,417
No, no, I'll go.
No, no, you go.

982
01:11:25,618 --> 01:11:27,777
- No, no, send somebody else.
- Yes, sir. Joe!

983
01:11:27,938 --> 01:11:31,457
Tell him I must see him immediately.
The show depends on it.

984
01:11:31,617 --> 01:11:34,177
This is going to be the death of me.
This is awful.

985
01:11:34,337 --> 01:11:36,657
Wait here for me. You will wait?

986
01:11:36,817 --> 01:11:38,577
You bet I will.

987
01:11:47,018 --> 01:11:48,457
Yes?

988
01:11:49,257 --> 01:11:51,538
- Hello, Sam. How are y'all?
- Mr. Rogers?

989
01:11:51,698 --> 01:11:54,258
You look kind of worried.
What's on your mind, Sam?

990
01:11:54,418 --> 01:11:56,178
I was looking for Mr. Ziegfeld.

991
01:11:56,338 --> 01:11:57,737
Just a minute, Sam.

992
01:11:57,978 --> 01:12:00,897
Mr. Ziegfeld, it's very important.
The costumer's--

993
01:12:01,057 --> 01:12:04,057
Will, the audiences love
to hear you talk.

994
01:12:04,217 --> 01:12:08,337
Well, shucks, Flo.
I can't talk any more than I do.

995
01:12:08,497 --> 01:12:10,377
Gotta get the rope tricks in, don't I?

996
01:12:10,578 --> 01:12:12,977
I think they like to hear
your wisecracks better.

997
01:12:13,137 --> 01:12:18,097
Perhaps they do, but what will I talk about?
I ain't got anything to say that's funny.

998
01:12:18,258 --> 01:12:20,297
- Mr. Ziegfeld--
- Now wait a minute, Sam.

999
01:12:20,497 --> 01:12:23,338
Your wife tells me you keep
her laughing all the time...

1000
01:12:23,537 --> 01:12:25,697
...just about things
you read in the papers.

1001
01:12:25,857 --> 01:12:28,897
I catch on. Betty's been putting
you up to this, huh?

1002
01:12:29,057 --> 01:12:34,257
Well, I got a sort of a habit of telling her
all I know is what I read in the papers...

1003
01:12:34,417 --> 01:12:38,377
...and she says that's what I ought
to tell the audience.

1004
01:12:38,537 --> 01:12:40,977
Just sort of be kind
of a running gag item.

1005
01:12:41,137 --> 01:12:45,097
- She's right.
- Oh, sure, Betty's always right.

1006
01:12:45,297 --> 01:12:51,017
But she don't have to stand on the stage
and catch those overripe tomatoes...

1007
01:12:51,217 --> 01:12:54,377
- ...if the gag don't work.
- Mr. Ziegfeld, I must interrupt you.

1008
01:12:55,377 --> 01:12:58,537
- The finale costumes are here.
- Oh, good.

1009
01:12:58,696 --> 01:12:59,977
- Will you do it?
- I might.

1010
01:13:00,137 --> 01:13:03,057
- They won't leave without the money.
- Give them a check.

1011
01:13:03,216 --> 01:13:05,977
- Will you do it tonight?
- They want the cash.

1012
01:13:06,137 --> 01:13:08,976
They sent the costumes
for this show COD?

1013
01:13:09,137 --> 01:13:13,096
No, sir, not this show.
They want some money on the last show.

1014
01:13:13,617 --> 01:13:15,657
Reckon you got your shows mixed up?

1015
01:13:15,816 --> 01:13:17,297
Well, I reckon. A little.

1016
01:13:17,457 --> 01:13:20,057
If I can help you out on anything,
why, let me know.

1017
01:13:20,216 --> 01:13:21,777
Thanks, Bill. I'm all right.

1018
01:13:21,937 --> 01:13:23,177
Well, tell me if I can.

1019
01:13:23,337 --> 01:13:26,776
Of course, I don't suppose it makes
a lot of difference, because...

1020
01:13:26,936 --> 01:13:29,497
...even with the costumes on,
girls in this show...

1021
01:13:29,656 --> 01:13:31,856
...ain't exactly overdressed.

1022
01:13:32,217 --> 01:13:34,896
You save your wisecracks
for the audience, Bill.

1023
01:13:38,257 --> 01:13:40,177
- Hey, buddy! Hey!
- Yes?

1024
01:13:40,656 --> 01:13:44,096
Your opening night, your big chance,
and you're still moving scenery?

1025
01:13:44,257 --> 01:13:46,857
I can't help it, Mr. Ziegfeld.
It gets in the blood.

1026
01:13:47,017 --> 01:13:49,617
Besides, I don't know how
I'm gonna go over tonight.

1027
01:13:49,777 --> 01:13:52,337
I don't wanna lose a job
till I'm sure of the other.

1028
01:13:52,497 --> 01:13:55,217
When I hired you as an actor,
I fired you as a stagehand.

1029
01:13:55,377 --> 01:13:58,097
Better make good.
You'll find yourself without any job.

1030
01:13:59,217 --> 01:14:02,576
- Well, what seems to be the trouble?
- No trouble, I hope, except--

1031
01:14:02,736 --> 01:14:04,216
Except he's holding us up!

1032
01:14:04,376 --> 01:14:08,817
- He refuses to leave the costumes unless--
- Unless he gets some money, and he's right.

1033
01:14:09,016 --> 01:14:10,336
Let me see them first.

1034
01:14:10,496 --> 01:14:12,576
At once, Mr. Ziegfeld.
Open up the basket.

1035
01:14:12,736 --> 01:14:15,616
I tell you, Mr. Ziegfeld,
these dresses are wonderful.

1036
01:14:15,776 --> 01:14:20,336
The finest work I have ever done.
Look, Mr. Ziegfeld, isn't it stunning?

1037
01:14:21,137 --> 01:14:24,416
Perhaps you made a mistake.
This isn't for me.

1038
01:14:24,577 --> 01:14:27,736
Oh, yes, Mr. Ziegfeld, for the finale.

1039
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:29,456
Not my finale.

1040
01:14:29,616 --> 01:14:32,816
Mr. Schutz, this is the
New Amsterdam Theatre.

1041
01:14:32,976 --> 01:14:34,336
<i>This is the Follies.</i>

1042
01:14:34,496 --> 01:14:39,256
I know, Mr. Ziegfeld,
and this is the costume for the finale.

1043
01:14:39,816 --> 01:14:41,896
Well, not for my show.

1044
01:14:42,056 --> 01:14:45,856
Why, I couldn't let my girls appear
in a thing like that. That's horrible!

1045
01:14:46,016 --> 01:14:47,696
Oh, take it away.

1046
01:14:47,856 --> 01:14:51,536
But, Mr. Ziegfeld, they were made from
the sketches of your own designer.

1047
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:55,376
You yourself made the changes on
the sketches when you gave me the order.

1048
01:14:55,536 --> 01:14:59,655
I never ordered that. That's terrible!
Take it away, take it out of my theater!

1049
01:14:59,816 --> 01:15:03,016
But, Mr. Ziegfeld, I worked over
three weeks on these dresses.

1050
01:15:03,176 --> 01:15:05,135
I have plenty of money
invested in them.

1051
01:15:05,456 --> 01:15:08,975
I'm sorry, but I can't help that.
What do you want to do? Disgrace me?

1052
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:12,656
No, no, Mr. Ziegfeld. But please
do not disgrace me.

1053
01:15:12,815 --> 01:15:17,136
I mean, Mr. Ziegfeld, please
let your girls wear my costumes tonight.

1054
01:15:17,296 --> 01:15:18,855
No, I wouldn't humiliate them.

1055
01:15:19,016 --> 01:15:24,256
If you aren't satisfied, I'll make it up to you,
but please don't make me take them back.

1056
01:15:24,496 --> 01:15:28,295
All right, but just this once.
Send them up to the dressing rooms.

1057
01:15:28,656 --> 01:15:30,176
See me in my office next week.

1058
01:15:30,335 --> 01:15:31,616
- Next month.
- Next month.

1059
01:15:31,776 --> 01:15:33,655
Thank you very much, Mr. Ziegfeld.

1060
01:15:34,855 --> 01:15:37,696
- They are beautiful, aren't they?
- Awfully expensive.

1061
01:15:37,856 --> 01:15:40,296
All right, girls,
places for the melody number!

1062
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,936
He's singing very well
tonight, Mr. Ziegfeld.

1063
01:15:43,095 --> 01:15:45,256
He's all right,
but there's too much white.

1064
01:15:45,415 --> 01:15:48,656
Merv, he's too white.
Bring up the pink in your footlights.

1065
01:15:48,816 --> 01:15:51,895
Are the steps high enough
for you this time, Mr. Ziegfeld?

1066
01:15:52,496 --> 01:15:55,055
No, I don't think so.
We could use more, a lot more.

1067
01:15:55,216 --> 01:15:58,295
- I'd like to see them higher.
- How's that, Mr. Ziegfeld?

1068
01:15:58,455 --> 01:16:01,615
That's perfect now.
Keep it that way the rest of the number.

1069
01:25:01,611 --> 01:25:04,771
Ain't that something?
Don't you like your flowers, honey lamb?

1070
01:25:04,931 --> 01:25:08,931
- They're beautiful. Was there a card?
- Oh, sure. Here it is.

1071
01:25:09,131 --> 01:25:11,971
And there was a package too.
I done unwrapped it for you.

1072
01:25:12,131 --> 01:25:15,691
- You've done looked at it too, I suppose.
- Oh, no, honey lamb, I never.

1073
01:25:15,851 --> 01:25:19,051
- Pour me a drink, Flossie.
- Another? Ain't you all forgetting...

1074
01:25:19,211 --> 01:25:22,371
...you got a midnight show to do
on the roof tonight?

1075
01:25:22,531 --> 01:25:25,411
And ain't you all forgetting
to pour that drink?

1076
01:25:27,211 --> 01:25:32,211
Well, scratch my back, honey.
Is them diamonds, or is them stars?

1077
01:25:32,371 --> 01:25:35,011
- Who sent them to you, honey lamb?
- Who do you think?

1078
01:25:35,211 --> 01:25:38,211
I know.
They's from Mr. Zieg--

1079
01:25:38,611 --> 01:25:40,291
- Here he is.
- Tell him to come in.

1080
01:25:40,451 --> 01:25:41,891
Yes'm.

1081
01:25:45,651 --> 01:25:47,091
Audrey.

1082
01:25:48,491 --> 01:25:51,211
- You were beautiful tonight.
- Thank you.

1083
01:25:51,371 --> 01:25:52,931
Flossie, pour us a drink.

1084
01:25:53,090 --> 01:25:57,091
No, no, no, please, dear, no.
I just came to tell you--

1085
01:26:00,330 --> 01:26:03,370
<i>Somebody else thought
you were beautiful too, oui?</i>

1086
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:05,611
From an old friend.

1087
01:26:06,090 --> 01:26:08,450
Not too old, I hope.

1088
01:26:10,930 --> 01:26:14,571
What a beautiful bracelet, Audrey.

1089
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:17,171
Is this from your old friend too?

1090
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:20,691
- Do you like it?
- Yes, it's charming!

1091
01:26:21,131 --> 01:26:23,971
You know, your friend
must have very good taste...

1092
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:28,490
...because this is just the sort
of jewelry Flo would like.

1093
01:26:30,971 --> 01:26:34,531
I told you someday
you will have lots of diamonds, didn't I?

1094
01:26:34,691 --> 01:26:35,810
Yes, you did.

1095
01:26:35,970 --> 01:26:39,170
And I told you
I wouldn't suffer, remember?

1096
01:26:39,331 --> 01:26:40,731
Yes...

1097
01:26:40,890 --> 01:26:42,330
...I do.

1098
01:26:43,010 --> 01:26:46,250
Well, congratulations again, Audrey.

1099
01:26:48,010 --> 01:26:50,851
I'll see you later.
On the roof, oui?

1100
01:41:19,542 --> 01:41:22,142
She's really quite beautiful, Flo, oui?

1101
01:41:22,342 --> 01:41:26,942
- Yes, she is, isn't she?
- You're very much interested in her, oui?

1102
01:41:27,142 --> 01:41:29,502
I'm interested in all my girls, dear.

1103
01:41:29,662 --> 01:41:32,342
But maybe a tiny, little bit more
in her, oui?

1104
01:41:32,502 --> 01:41:34,062
A lot more.

1105
01:41:34,222 --> 01:41:36,062
- She's very unusual.
- Yes.

1106
01:41:36,222 --> 01:41:39,902
I could make a great star out of her,
if she'd only let me.

1107
01:41:46,382 --> 01:41:49,341
Ladies and gentlemen!

1108
01:41:49,702 --> 01:41:55,461
On behalf of the rest of the company,
I've been asked to make a little speech.

1109
01:41:56,981 --> 01:41:59,502
Well, you see,
I have a confession to make.

1110
01:41:59,662 --> 01:42:02,181
Little Audrey is a wee bit tight tonight.

1111
01:42:03,942 --> 01:42:07,062
No, but seriously,
you really shouldn't applaud all of us...

1112
01:42:07,222 --> 01:42:10,661
...because everything we've done
we owe to Flo.

1113
01:42:12,901 --> 01:42:16,542
You see, I was just a little chorus girl
when Flo discovered me.

1114
01:42:16,701 --> 01:42:19,861
He taught me how to walk
and how to dress...

1115
01:42:20,021 --> 01:42:22,542
...and how to smile.

1116
01:42:22,781 --> 01:42:24,182
So....

1117
01:42:24,381 --> 01:42:25,781
Well....

1118
01:42:25,982 --> 01:42:28,221
Here's to Flo.

1119
01:42:43,981 --> 01:42:47,021
I am afraid you must forgive
Miss Lane tonight.

1120
01:42:47,181 --> 01:42:51,342
She just passed through many weeks
of very tedious rehearsals.

1121
01:42:51,501 --> 01:42:55,701
And the nervous strain of an opening night.
She's not really herself.

1122
01:42:58,581 --> 01:43:01,061
On behalf of my company,
I want to thank you.

1123
01:43:01,221 --> 01:43:05,221
You've been very kind
to my girls and my stars.

1124
01:43:05,381 --> 01:43:07,461
And speaking of stars...

1125
01:43:07,621 --> 01:43:10,581
...there's a young lady here tonight
who, in my opinion...

1126
01:43:10,741 --> 01:43:13,341
...is destined to reach
the top of her profession.

1127
01:43:13,501 --> 01:43:16,181
She doesn't work for me,
I'm sorry to say...

1128
01:43:16,341 --> 01:43:20,501
...but I'm very proud of her. She's here
tonight with her producer, lucky fellow.

1129
01:43:20,660 --> 01:43:24,181
And if she will, I'm going to ask
Sally Manners to take a bow.

1130
01:43:24,341 --> 01:43:26,261
Sally Manners.

1131
01:43:32,781 --> 01:43:35,221
Nice of him to pay my star
a tribute, isn't it?

1132
01:43:35,381 --> 01:43:39,901
Yes, it is. I hope you've got her
on a long contract.

1133
01:43:40,781 --> 01:43:42,821
- Are you ready, Mr. Ziegfeld?
- All ready.

1134
01:43:42,981 --> 01:43:46,221
Now, you'll be signing the contract
but look in the camera.

1135
01:43:46,381 --> 01:43:50,181
The picture wouldn't be right
without the Manners smile.

1136
01:43:50,341 --> 01:43:52,900
All right?
All right, shoot!

1137
01:43:53,061 --> 01:43:54,500
Those things horrify me.

1138
01:43:54,660 --> 01:43:58,741
- I think we're both to be congratulated.
- I feel it's a great opportunity.

1139
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:01,660
- Thank you.
- Sage, if you'll take Miss Manners...

1140
01:44:01,861 --> 01:44:05,340
...and the boys into your office,
I'm sure she'll have things to say.

1141
01:44:05,541 --> 01:44:08,701
- I could tell them how happy I am now.
- May I congratulate you?

1142
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:11,461
- Thank you.
- Right this way, Miss Manners.

1143
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:13,860
- Ms. Manners....
- Come along now, boys.

1144
01:44:22,541 --> 01:44:26,300
- Where's that girl you said was my friend?
- Here I am.

1145
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:29,860
I didn't want to disturb you.

1146
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:36,340
You told them out there
that you were a friend of mine, huh?

1147
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:38,500
Yes, I did.

1148
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:41,341
Well, I see.
Just to get into my office, huh?

1149
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:44,420
- Smart girl.
- Well, I am a friend of yours.

1150
01:44:44,580 --> 01:44:46,740
Have you forgotten me?

1151
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:51,660
No, no, of course not. I....

1152
01:44:51,820 --> 01:44:54,340
I remember you very well.

1153
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:56,541
Who am I?

1154
01:44:56,740 --> 01:44:58,780
- As if I didn't know.
- Do you?

1155
01:44:58,940 --> 01:45:03,180
Of course. I always remember
the time, the place and the girl.

1156
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:05,140
It was....

1157
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:07,060
- Atlantic City.
- Nope.

1158
01:45:07,220 --> 01:45:08,980
- No?
- No.

1159
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:12,860
Well, that's funny. I seem to remember
a chair on a boardwalk...

1160
01:45:13,020 --> 01:45:16,820
...you beside me and....
Are you sure it wasn't Atlantic City?

1161
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:19,860
It might have been Atlantic City,
but it wasn't me.

1162
01:45:24,340 --> 01:45:27,099
Now I remember!
Why, it was right here in this office.

1163
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:30,980
You came up to see me about a year ago.
Oh, now it all comes back to me.

1164
01:45:31,140 --> 01:45:33,780
Well, how are you?
Where have you been?

1165
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:35,260
No.

1166
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:37,420
- No?
- No. You don't seem to remember...

1167
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:40,020
...the time, the place or the girl.

1168
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:41,619
Well....

1169
01:45:41,779 --> 01:45:43,780
Perhaps this will help you.

1170
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:56,579
Mary Lou!

1171
01:45:56,820 --> 01:45:59,260
Well, how's my girl?

1172
01:45:59,459 --> 01:46:01,340
How's my fella?

1173
01:46:01,939 --> 01:46:04,620
Well, my little Mary Lou
is a big girl now, isn't she?

1174
01:46:04,779 --> 01:46:06,220
Yes!

1175
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:11,300
Yes, indeed, a very big girl.

1176
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:14,819
- Aren't you glad to see me?
- Yes, I certainly am!

1177
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:18,219
Even if I wasn't at Atlantic City
with you?

1178
01:46:18,379 --> 01:46:20,900
Don't be silly.
I knew you all the time.

1179
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:23,419
Now, fibber....

1180
01:46:24,259 --> 01:46:26,739
- Well, how long you been in New York?
- One day.

1181
01:46:26,899 --> 01:46:29,979
- One day. You seen my father lately?
- Yes, just before I left.

1182
01:46:30,179 --> 01:46:33,419
Oh, that reminds me,
he told me to give you a big kiss.

1183
01:46:34,939 --> 01:46:36,260
Well.

1184
01:46:36,419 --> 01:46:39,459
You know, I think that in all fairness...

1185
01:46:39,619 --> 01:46:44,259
- ...I should tell you I am a married man now.
- Yes, I know. I read about it.

1186
01:46:44,419 --> 01:46:46,940
It nearly broke my heart.

1187
01:46:47,139 --> 01:46:50,739
But being married in New York
doesn't mean anything, does it?

1188
01:46:51,139 --> 01:46:53,059
Oh, yes, it does, young lady.

1189
01:46:54,259 --> 01:46:56,820
Now, why are you here,
and what can I do for you?

1190
01:46:56,979 --> 01:47:01,060
Well, first of all, I want to give you
a big kiss for all the candy you sent me.

1191
01:47:01,219 --> 01:47:03,979
You've already done that twice.
Now, what else?

1192
01:47:04,139 --> 01:47:07,099
- Well, I want to go into the Follies.
- You do?

1193
01:47:07,459 --> 01:47:10,179
- I've been taking dancing lessons two years.
- Yeah?

1194
01:47:10,339 --> 01:47:14,779
- How do your father and mother feel?
- I haven't a father and mother anymore.

1195
01:47:14,939 --> 01:47:17,019
I'm so sorry, my dear.

1196
01:47:17,219 --> 01:47:19,899
Of course, Jimmy won't like it.

1197
01:47:20,059 --> 01:47:23,379
- Who's Jimmy?
- Just another fellow I've been engaged to.

1198
01:47:23,579 --> 01:47:25,339
Oh, well....

1199
01:47:25,539 --> 01:47:29,859
- All right, I think we can look after you.
- Do you think we can have dinner tonight?

1200
01:47:30,019 --> 01:47:33,339
Well, no, no, I'm afraid we can't.

1201
01:47:35,339 --> 01:47:36,899
- Oh, Alice!
- Yes, sir.

1202
01:47:37,059 --> 01:47:41,299
Take this lady down to the stage and tell
Julian to put her on as an extra dancer.

1203
01:47:41,459 --> 01:47:44,019
- For the time being.
- Oh, gee, thank you!

1204
01:47:45,139 --> 01:47:49,139
Mary Lou is an old friend of mine
from Chicago, and she's a stranger here.

1205
01:47:49,298 --> 01:47:52,619
- So I'd like you to sort of look after her.
- Yes, sir.

1206
01:47:52,779 --> 01:47:56,259
- This way, dear.
- Oh, may I say one thing before I go?

1207
01:47:56,418 --> 01:48:00,179
- Well, yes, of course. What?
- I forgive you for not marrying me.

1208
01:48:00,658 --> 01:48:04,219
- All right. Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye.

1209
01:48:05,218 --> 01:48:08,058
- Hello. Pardon me. Hello, Alice.
- Say, Flo!

1210
01:48:08,419 --> 01:48:09,858
I know! You got a new song.

1211
01:48:10,018 --> 01:48:12,419
I'll say we have.
Play him the melody, Danny.

1212
01:48:12,578 --> 01:48:15,218
Oh, you'll go crazy over this, Flo.

1213
01:48:16,899 --> 01:48:18,618
Mr. Ziegfeld.

1214
01:48:19,379 --> 01:48:21,459
I must interrupt you.
This is important.

1215
01:48:21,618 --> 01:48:23,538
- I got an idea.
- How much will it save?

1216
01:48:23,698 --> 01:48:26,458
- This has nothing to do with money.
- Feeling all right?

1217
01:48:26,618 --> 01:48:28,859
My usual headache,
but this is about talent.

1218
01:48:29,058 --> 01:48:32,738
- Good and cheap, no doubt?
- Exactly. A young lady, the name of Brice.

1219
01:48:32,898 --> 01:48:36,379
- Fannie Brice. She's working in burlesque.
- I've seen that gal, Flo.

1220
01:48:36,539 --> 01:48:37,938
- Pretty?
- Well, yes and no.

1221
01:48:38,138 --> 01:48:40,858
Shut your eyes and listen, yes.
Open them and look, no.

1222
01:48:41,059 --> 01:48:44,339
- But a great performer.
- We should see her at once, tonight.

1223
01:49:18,298 --> 01:49:21,818
- Shall I take your coat?
- Why not? You bought it for me.

1224
01:49:22,018 --> 01:49:25,258
I gave it to you because you've been
behaving yourself this week.

1225
01:49:25,418 --> 01:49:27,418
What are you going to give me
next week?

1226
01:49:27,618 --> 01:49:30,018
- Watch the show.
- I don't see how you can find...

1227
01:49:30,178 --> 01:49:32,258
...great stars in a place like this.

1228
01:49:32,418 --> 01:49:36,137
Some of our greatest stars
have come from places like this.

1229
01:49:36,538 --> 01:49:40,178
Well, of course, not being a star yet,
I wouldn't know.

1230
01:49:40,338 --> 01:49:41,978
You can, if you behave yourself.

1231
01:51:20,897 --> 01:51:23,137
- What's on now, Fannie?
- Jim Boss.

1232
01:51:23,297 --> 01:51:27,177
- If that guy's funny, I'll be a--
- That guy's gonna be a big star someday.

1233
01:51:27,337 --> 01:51:31,017
- He can make you laugh and make you cry.
- Yeah, and he can make me sick.

1234
01:51:31,177 --> 01:51:33,337
Comics bore me.

1235
01:51:33,536 --> 01:51:37,657
You give me a pain in the neck too, always
telling me who's gonna be a great star.

1236
01:51:37,857 --> 01:51:40,337
Once in burlesque, always in burlesque.

1237
01:51:40,497 --> 01:51:42,777
Unless you got looks or a voice
or something.

1238
01:51:42,937 --> 01:51:45,097
- Well, that's what I got, kid.
- What?

1239
01:51:45,257 --> 01:51:46,817
- Something.
- On the level...

1240
01:51:46,976 --> 01:51:49,137
...you don't hope to get out
of burlesque?

1241
01:51:49,296 --> 01:51:52,217
You're good here because these people
are from 10th Avenue.

1242
01:51:52,417 --> 01:51:55,017
How good do you think you'd be
on Fifth Avenue?

1243
01:51:55,177 --> 01:51:58,137
Half as good.
Another silk stocking gone.

1244
01:51:58,297 --> 01:52:01,537
I'll never buy anything
from those stage-door peddlers again.

1245
01:52:01,697 --> 01:52:05,056
That's what you said before.
What'd you let the fella in for? Here.

1246
01:52:05,216 --> 01:52:08,216
He told the stage doorman
his name was Belasco.

1247
01:52:08,417 --> 01:52:11,457
And you thought it was the Mr. Belasco,
the producer.

1248
01:52:11,616 --> 01:52:15,456
- Calling personally to see you?
- Well, maybe I was a little optimistic.

1249
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:19,257
Miss Brice,
Mr. Ziegfeld is here to see you.

1250
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:20,656
Another peddler.

1251
01:52:20,816 --> 01:52:23,497
First it's Belasco, now it's Ziegfeld.

1252
01:52:23,657 --> 01:52:27,577
Tell Mr. Ziegfeld I'm not in, and if
I was in, tell him I wouldn't see him.

1253
01:52:27,777 --> 01:52:31,057
And if I did see him,
tell him I wouldn't buy a thing.

1254
01:52:31,256 --> 01:52:33,617
- Yes, miss.
- Thank you.

1255
01:52:33,816 --> 01:52:35,376
Miss Brice?

1256
01:52:36,576 --> 01:52:38,857
I hope I'm not intruding.

1257
01:52:39,016 --> 01:52:41,416
- I'm Florenz Ziegfeld.
- Is that so?

1258
01:52:41,577 --> 01:52:45,656
Sarah, this is Mr. Ziegfeld.
Mr. Ziegfeld, this is Sarah Bernhardt.

1259
01:52:45,817 --> 01:52:48,177
Not the Sarah Bernhardt?

1260
01:52:48,376 --> 01:52:49,736
Well....

1261
01:52:49,896 --> 01:52:53,497
- A pleasure to run into you.
- If you run into your friend Belasco...

1262
01:52:53,657 --> 01:52:55,896
...tell him about the runs
in his stockings.

1263
01:52:56,056 --> 01:52:59,096
- Do you know David Belasco?
- Better than you know Ziegfeld.

1264
01:52:59,257 --> 01:53:01,576
Well, come on,
what do you want for it?

1265
01:53:01,737 --> 01:53:03,216
I'm not interested.

1266
01:53:03,416 --> 01:53:06,456
Miss Brice, I am here to offer you
a great opportunity.

1267
01:53:06,656 --> 01:53:08,696
That's what they all say.

1268
01:53:09,616 --> 01:53:11,616
What kind of fur is this?

1269
01:53:11,776 --> 01:53:13,216
This?

1270
01:53:13,696 --> 01:53:15,696
- That's mink.
- That so?

1271
01:53:16,296 --> 01:53:17,936
And what's the price?

1272
01:53:18,096 --> 01:53:20,736
Well, the original cost was $2700.

1273
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:23,896
Who cares from originals?
Copies is just as good.

1274
01:53:24,096 --> 01:53:25,776
Come on, I'll try it on.

1275
01:53:25,936 --> 01:53:27,736
Yes, of course.

1276
01:53:28,096 --> 01:53:31,136
As a matter of fact,
it ought to fit you very well.

1277
01:53:31,296 --> 01:53:33,656
Don't give me the talk,
just tell me the price.

1278
01:53:33,856 --> 01:53:36,896
I don't wanna buy it,
but I'll give you $50 for it.

1279
01:53:37,056 --> 01:53:40,456
- And not a cent more.
- Miss Brice, the coat is yours.

1280
01:53:40,616 --> 01:53:44,376
- Stuck again.
- Fannie! Are you really gonna buy it?

1281
01:53:44,536 --> 01:53:48,896
If I can give Belasco 4 dollars
for silk stockings made of cotton...

1282
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:52,256
...I can give Ziegfeld more
for a mink coat made of skunk.

1283
01:53:52,416 --> 01:53:54,816
Besides, a bargain's a bargain.
Here.

1284
01:53:54,976 --> 01:53:56,695
Here's your $40.

1285
01:53:56,896 --> 01:53:59,376
Get out before I change my mind.

1286
01:53:59,536 --> 01:54:00,976
Thank you.

1287
01:54:06,816 --> 01:54:08,215
Fannie!

1288
01:54:09,735 --> 01:54:11,416
- Fannie!
- What?

1289
01:54:11,615 --> 01:54:13,135
Fannie, look!

1290
01:54:13,295 --> 01:54:16,415
- What? Moths already?
- No, feel! It's real mink.

1291
01:54:16,575 --> 01:54:17,815
How do you know?

1292
01:54:18,016 --> 01:54:20,216
I've been promised one
often enough to tell.

1293
01:54:20,376 --> 01:54:24,255
It's real mink, all right.
It's probably stolen goods.

1294
01:54:24,416 --> 01:54:27,975
- You mean it's hot?
- Of course it's warm.

1295
01:54:28,136 --> 01:54:31,255
- Then I'll be arrested if I keep it?
- Of course you will.

1296
01:54:31,416 --> 01:54:34,616
Call the stage manager!
Call the police! Call my mother!

1297
01:54:35,455 --> 01:54:37,216
Come in.

1298
01:54:37,375 --> 01:54:39,735
Message for Miss Brice.

1299
01:54:39,936 --> 01:54:42,095
You read it. I'm dying.

1300
01:54:42,855 --> 01:54:44,135
"Dear Fannie Brice.

1301
01:54:44,295 --> 01:54:48,055
I can't accept your $40, but you can
please me by accepting the coat.

1302
01:54:48,215 --> 01:54:51,415
I shall expect you at my office
in the New Amsterdam tomorrow...

1303
01:54:51,615 --> 01:54:53,735
...as I want to engage you
for the Follies.

1304
01:54:53,895 --> 01:54:55,976
Florenz Ziegfeld Jr."

1305
01:54:56,135 --> 01:54:58,775
Fannie, it was him!
It was Ziegfeld!

1306
01:54:58,935 --> 01:55:01,015
How do you like that?

1307
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:03,656
I like it.

1308
01:55:04,736 --> 01:55:07,015
Fannie! Fannie!
Have you fainted?

1309
01:55:07,175 --> 01:55:10,415
Can't you see I have, you chump?
Get me some whiskey!

1310
01:55:12,296 --> 01:55:14,255
- Oh, Miss Brice?
- Yes, sir?

1311
01:55:14,455 --> 01:55:16,695
- We're ready for you.
- I'm coming right down.

1312
01:55:16,855 --> 01:55:21,135
Yes, sir, I'll be right down.
I'm coming as fast as I can.

1313
01:55:21,336 --> 01:55:23,775
I thought I had more time.

1314
01:55:27,695 --> 01:55:30,815
Don't lose your nerve, kid.
This is your big chance.

1315
01:55:30,975 --> 01:55:32,855
Be a trouper!

1316
01:55:33,015 --> 01:55:36,375
Look at you. You're working
for Ziegfeld now.

1317
01:55:36,575 --> 01:55:38,775
And you look like a million dollars.

1318
01:55:38,935 --> 01:55:42,735
For the first time in your life,
you're class, you mug.

1319
01:55:48,215 --> 01:55:51,415
Wait a minute! Ho!

1320
01:55:52,375 --> 01:55:55,695
What in the--? Fannie!
What in the world are you made up for?

1321
01:55:55,855 --> 01:55:57,255
Veronica? Clarence?

1322
01:55:57,415 --> 01:55:59,375
Anything I can do, Mr. Ziegfeld?

1323
01:55:59,535 --> 01:56:01,015
Yes. Come here, will you?

1324
01:56:01,214 --> 01:56:03,414
Yes, Mr. Ziegfeld?

1325
01:56:04,815 --> 01:56:06,215
Will you rip off that train?

1326
01:56:06,375 --> 01:56:08,494
- But, Mr. Ziegfeld!
- Go ahead.

1327
01:56:08,655 --> 01:56:12,854
Take off the hat.
Get rid of this boa constrictor.

1328
01:56:13,055 --> 01:56:15,575
Now, will you get me a shawl?
An old shawl.

1329
01:56:15,734 --> 01:56:17,374
Yes, sir.

1330
01:56:17,534 --> 01:56:20,735
How do you expect Miss Brice
to sing a sad song about her man...

1331
01:56:20,895 --> 01:56:22,574
...dressed up like a nightingale?

1332
01:56:22,734 --> 01:56:25,015
I find personalities,
you try to destroy them.

1333
01:56:25,214 --> 01:56:27,534
I didn't engage Miss Brice
as a showgirl.

1334
01:56:27,934 --> 01:56:31,575
- Is that all right, Mr. Ziegfeld?
- Well, that's all right for now.

1335
01:56:31,735 --> 01:56:33,495
Tomorrow, buy her another outfit.

1336
01:56:33,694 --> 01:56:36,215
Go to a secondhand store
and get her an old dress.

1337
01:56:36,414 --> 01:56:40,934
She's supposed to be an apache,
a poor French girl, an urchin.

1338
01:56:41,894 --> 01:56:44,534
So to work for Ziegfeld,
I gotta be an urchin.

1339
01:56:44,735 --> 01:56:46,935
Even in burlesque,
I was middle class.

1340
01:56:47,094 --> 01:56:48,695
Now...

1341
01:56:48,855 --> 01:56:50,534
...let me see this, Fannie.

1342
01:56:54,335 --> 01:56:55,815
Fannie?

1343
01:56:55,975 --> 01:56:58,015
Sing the song. Now!

1344
01:56:58,494 --> 01:57:01,494
Vic? All right. Let's go.

1345
01:57:41,574 --> 01:57:45,654
If she can turn those tears on in front
of an audience, she'll be a sensation.

1346
01:57:45,854 --> 01:57:47,093
Look.

1347
01:57:48,334 --> 01:57:50,134
Look at the girls.

1348
01:57:56,014 --> 01:57:58,613
Mr. Ziegfeld, shall we get back
to that conference?

1349
01:57:58,774 --> 01:58:00,654
The boys are still waiting, you know.

1350
01:58:00,854 --> 01:58:03,014
Yeah, yeah. Tell them I'll be right up.

1351
01:58:15,134 --> 01:58:17,774
She's all right.
She's gonna be great.

1352
01:58:17,933 --> 01:58:19,573
- Who's that?
- Brice. Fannie Brice.

1353
01:58:19,774 --> 01:58:23,374
- I've got a great spot for her in this show.
- And I discovered her!

1354
01:58:23,533 --> 01:58:25,774
That's right, Sam,
and you deserve a raise.

1355
01:58:25,934 --> 01:58:30,133
And I'd give it to him, but I'm afraid
he wouldn't approve of the expense.

1356
01:58:30,334 --> 01:58:33,013
- How's it look, Gene?
- It's the best we've ever done.

1357
01:58:33,214 --> 01:58:35,893
You're the best author.
Herbert's the best composer.

1358
01:58:36,053 --> 01:58:40,013
Julian's the best director. Joe's the best
artist. Sam's the best bookkeeper.

1359
01:58:40,293 --> 01:58:43,293
I'm dying to hear it.
Every line he writes is a laugh.

1360
01:58:45,373 --> 01:58:48,253
We open on a street in Cairo.

1361
01:58:49,934 --> 01:58:52,814
Didn't I tell you every line
was a laugh?

1362
01:58:57,454 --> 01:59:01,613
We open on a street in Cairo.
Along comes a man leading an elephant.

1363
01:59:01,773 --> 01:59:03,693
Wait just a minute, Gene.

1364
01:59:04,734 --> 01:59:07,614
- Can you boys stand a shock?
- Well, what do you mean, Flo?

1365
01:59:07,774 --> 01:59:11,293
I hate to tell you this because
I know how hard you've worked....

1366
01:59:11,454 --> 01:59:14,334
- But I've decided not to do another Follies.
- What?

1367
01:59:14,493 --> 01:59:17,774
I'm going on with this new edition
with Brice...

1368
01:59:17,973 --> 01:59:21,813
...but after that I wanna do a story.
Something with a plot.

1369
01:59:22,014 --> 01:59:26,693
Something with all the glamour
of the Follies, around a sweet, simple story.

1370
01:59:26,853 --> 01:59:29,853
Something that will fit this little girl
Sally Manners.

1371
01:59:30,013 --> 01:59:31,893
We might call it Sally.

1372
01:59:32,053 --> 01:59:33,813
Oh, Jerry.

1373
01:59:34,013 --> 01:59:35,213
Hello, Flo. How are you?

1374
01:59:35,373 --> 01:59:38,293
- I was just thinking of you.
- It's nice to be thought of.

1375
01:59:38,493 --> 01:59:39,773
- Hello, boys.
- Hello.

1376
01:59:39,933 --> 01:59:42,933
Remember that melody you played
at my house a few weeks ago?

1377
01:59:43,133 --> 01:59:45,533
- I played several.
- And they were all beautiful.

1378
01:59:45,693 --> 01:59:49,333
But this one was.... You remember?
You were going to send it to me.

1379
01:59:49,533 --> 01:59:51,573
Oh, I know.
"Look for the Silver Lining."

1380
01:59:51,773 --> 01:59:54,213
That's the one. Come on, play it.
Do you mind?

1381
01:59:54,373 --> 01:59:56,613
Sure, I will.
I've got the lyrics right here.

1382
01:59:56,773 --> 01:59:59,213
Fine. Get this.

1383
01:59:59,653 --> 02:00:01,933
"Look for the Silver Lining."

1384
02:00:12,732 --> 02:00:14,573
See what I mean?
That's what I want.

1385
02:00:14,733 --> 02:00:17,613
A story just as simple and sweet
as that tune.

1386
02:00:17,813 --> 02:00:19,093
Sing it, Jerry, will you?

1387
02:01:03,292 --> 02:01:04,772
Ziegfeld...

1388
02:01:04,932 --> 02:01:09,452
...these gentlemen are pestering me about
money for scenery, costumes and whatnot.

1389
02:01:09,612 --> 02:01:13,332
And I wanna tell you in their presence,
I have no interest in this show...

1390
02:01:13,493 --> 02:01:15,772
...and in no way am I concerned with it.

1391
02:01:15,932 --> 02:01:20,332
Our agreement is for Ziegfeld Follies
and nothing else.

1392
02:01:20,493 --> 02:01:23,373
You understand that, gentlemen?
Nothing else.

1393
02:01:23,933 --> 02:01:26,692
Mr. Ziegfeld, this is very unpleasant
at a rehearsal...

1394
02:01:26,852 --> 02:01:30,373
...but we insist on at least 50 percent
of our money before opening.

1395
02:01:30,532 --> 02:01:34,572
- We are selling a lot of tickets.
- Sampston, that's our best proposition.

1396
02:01:34,732 --> 02:01:38,092
- Mr. Ziegfeld, we're ready for the finale.
- All right, Benny.

1397
02:01:38,252 --> 02:01:40,572
Boys, what are you worried about?

1398
02:01:40,732 --> 02:01:44,532
Have I started anything I couldn't finish?
Don't my curtains always go up?

1399
02:01:44,732 --> 02:01:47,732
Why, if I owed you 100 times
the amount I do, you'd get it.

1400
02:01:47,892 --> 02:01:50,972
- Come to me tomorrow, I'll pay you.
- 50 percent, Mr. Ziegfeld.

1401
02:01:51,132 --> 02:01:52,852
A hundred percent if you want it.

1402
02:01:53,052 --> 02:01:55,932
Maybe I can give you an advance
on the Eddie Cantor show.

1403
02:01:56,092 --> 02:01:57,772
I'm doing a story with him too.

1404
02:01:57,932 --> 02:02:00,092
Eddie Cantor?

1405
02:02:02,092 --> 02:02:04,052
How are you gonna do it?

1406
02:02:04,612 --> 02:02:07,052
- I don't know.
- Finale.

1407
02:02:11,611 --> 02:02:14,132
Mr. Ziegfeld, Audrey Dane
is visiting backstage...

1408
02:02:14,332 --> 02:02:16,772
...and she brought a lot
of champagne with her.

1409
02:02:16,932 --> 02:02:19,092
- Well....
- Yes, sir?

1410
02:02:19,892 --> 02:02:21,372
Never mind.

1411
02:02:22,812 --> 02:02:27,371
- It looks very good, the show, huh?
- Yes, it's wonderful, really.

1412
02:02:28,891 --> 02:02:31,812
- I'll be back in a moment, darling.
- All right.

1413
02:02:49,692 --> 02:02:50,931
Hello.

1414
02:02:52,812 --> 02:02:55,731
I wanna see every one of you
in my office in the morning.

1415
02:02:56,331 --> 02:02:57,651
Get out.

1416
02:03:04,612 --> 02:03:07,772
Audrey, you know I've forbidden
drinking in the dressing rooms.

1417
02:03:07,931 --> 02:03:10,251
Oh, Flo, don't be mad at me.

1418
02:03:10,411 --> 02:03:12,611
I just asked the girls up
to have a drink.

1419
02:03:12,771 --> 02:03:15,091
It isn't their fault.
You see, it's my f--

1420
02:03:15,251 --> 02:03:18,292
Now, Audrey, please.
Please stand up now.

1421
02:03:18,491 --> 02:03:20,892
I can't. I wanna get down,
but I can't get down.

1422
02:03:21,052 --> 02:03:22,931
Lift me, Flo.

1423
02:03:23,092 --> 02:03:24,691
Audrey.

1424
02:03:26,652 --> 02:03:30,291
Oh, don't put me down.
Don't put me down.

1425
02:03:30,451 --> 02:03:33,691
Audrey, you've broken
your last promise to me.

1426
02:03:36,651 --> 02:03:38,131
Flo!

1427
02:03:40,331 --> 02:03:44,811
You should have at least
closed the door.

1428
02:03:45,731 --> 02:03:47,171
Wait!

1429
02:03:47,331 --> 02:03:48,811
Anna!

1430
02:03:50,451 --> 02:03:53,491
Anna, please don't misjudge me.
I couldn't help it.

1431
02:03:53,651 --> 02:03:55,611
She's drunk.

1432
02:03:55,771 --> 02:03:58,931
Do you always do that
when she's drunk?

1433
02:03:59,131 --> 02:04:01,811
The members of your company
must enjoy that very much.

1434
02:04:01,971 --> 02:04:03,891
Oh, Anna, don't say that.

1435
02:04:04,091 --> 02:04:06,611
Don't you understand, dear?
When one of my girls--

1436
02:04:06,771 --> 02:04:11,890
Poor Flo. You have so much trouble
with your girls, oui?

1437
02:04:17,851 --> 02:04:19,251
Anna!

1438
02:04:26,931 --> 02:04:29,531
Aren't you going to eat
your grapefruit, sir?

1439
02:04:29,691 --> 02:04:31,770
No, nothing, Sidney.

1440
02:04:33,331 --> 02:04:36,371
Well, we know now why she didn't
come home last night.

1441
02:04:36,570 --> 02:04:37,891
I'm sorry, sir.

1442
02:04:38,050 --> 02:04:41,251
- Did you send the flowers?
- The minute I learned the address.

1443
02:04:41,411 --> 02:04:44,691
- A dozen orchids as usual.
- Good.

1444
02:04:50,410 --> 02:04:52,971
Mr. Sampston called again, sir.

1445
02:04:53,130 --> 02:04:56,690
He says the bank positively refuses
to increase your loans.

1446
02:04:56,850 --> 02:05:00,010
- Thank you, Sidney.
- Yes, sir.

1447
02:05:38,970 --> 02:05:41,010
- Miss Dane, sir.
- Here?

1448
02:05:41,170 --> 02:05:43,730
Undoubtedly she's read the paper, sir.

1449
02:05:45,330 --> 02:05:47,170
Show her in, Sidney.

1450
02:05:53,570 --> 02:05:56,690
Well, Flo, congratulations.

1451
02:05:56,890 --> 02:06:00,050
- On what?
- I just saw the headline.

1452
02:06:01,450 --> 02:06:03,770
I don't think I'm to be congratulated,
Audrey.

1453
02:06:04,810 --> 02:06:07,089
Little Audrey is speaking
out of turn again.

1454
02:06:07,250 --> 02:06:11,250
- And I was a bad girl last night too.
- I don't think you should have come here.

1455
02:06:11,410 --> 02:06:12,890
So that's how you feel.

1456
02:06:13,050 --> 02:06:16,050
- Going to Atlantic City tonight?
- No.

1457
02:06:16,250 --> 02:06:19,490
- Isn't the show opening there tomorrow?
- No.

1458
02:06:19,650 --> 02:06:21,650
Broke again?

1459
02:06:21,850 --> 02:06:23,970
Yes, broke again.

1460
02:06:25,650 --> 02:06:30,330
- Please don't turn the elephant, Audrey.
- Afraid I'll spoil your luck?

1461
02:06:31,209 --> 02:06:32,370
So...

1462
02:06:32,530 --> 02:06:36,050
...nobody thinks enough of your new star
to loan you money.

1463
02:06:36,210 --> 02:06:37,929
I don't blame them.

1464
02:06:38,090 --> 02:06:42,130
Why didn't you star me in the show?
You, with all your promises.

1465
02:06:42,329 --> 02:06:46,930
"Audrey, if you'll just behave yourself,
I'll put your name on Broadway."

1466
02:06:47,089 --> 02:06:51,249
"Audrey, if you'll only stop drinking,
I'll have great shows written for you."

1467
02:06:51,410 --> 02:06:54,010
Why didn't you make me
a great star?

1468
02:06:54,690 --> 02:06:57,330
- I couldn't depend on you, as I could on--
- Yes!

1469
02:06:57,529 --> 02:06:59,490
Well, all right. Depend on her now.

1470
02:06:59,650 --> 02:07:01,970
Go on, star her.
Do anything you like with her.

1471
02:07:02,169 --> 02:07:05,449
I hate you!
I'm never gonna see you again.

1472
02:07:05,609 --> 02:07:09,329
I'm quitting you and your show.
I hope you don't get the money to open it.

1473
02:07:09,489 --> 02:07:13,490
And if you do, I hope it's a flop!
That's how I feel about you!

1474
02:07:14,289 --> 02:07:16,889
And this is how I feel
about your elephant!

1475
02:07:41,450 --> 02:07:43,650
- Sidney?
- Yes, sir?

1476
02:07:43,809 --> 02:07:45,529
Take a wire to Mr. Billings.

1477
02:07:50,370 --> 02:07:52,489
Will that be all, Mr. Billings?

1478
02:07:53,009 --> 02:07:55,449
Yes, that'll be all, thank you.

1479
02:08:03,129 --> 02:08:07,009
- Miss Jones, take care of that right away.
- Yes, sir.

1480
02:08:08,569 --> 02:08:12,568
I got another telegram from Ziegfeld.
He can't open his show unless we help him.

1481
02:08:12,729 --> 02:08:15,049
We won't help him.
I told him so yesterday.

1482
02:08:15,209 --> 02:08:17,969
I'm not interested,
and I won't loan him 5 cents.

1483
02:08:18,169 --> 02:08:19,729
- Send him a wire--
- I just did.

1484
02:08:19,889 --> 02:08:23,049
- Did what?
- Wired him the money.

1485
02:08:58,529 --> 02:09:00,889
Isn't that Mr. Ziegfeld?

1486
02:09:01,888 --> 02:09:04,329
Say, Flo, why don't you go
put on the costume...

1487
02:09:04,528 --> 02:09:07,808
- ...and get into the spirit of the dance.
- I'm tired, Gene.

1488
02:09:07,968 --> 02:09:11,329
Come on, Flo.
Don't lose interest in everything.

1489
02:09:11,488 --> 02:09:14,329
No, I'm going home.
Good night.

1490
02:09:14,488 --> 02:09:16,929
- Let me have that megaphone, honey.
- Yes, sir.

1491
02:09:17,088 --> 02:09:18,768
- Willie.
- Flo, you're not leaving.

1492
02:09:18,928 --> 02:09:21,408
- Yes, I am.
- We're starting a Paul Jones inside...

1493
02:09:21,569 --> 02:09:25,208
...and I promise whenever you get
a pretty girl, I'll blow the whistle.

1494
02:09:25,368 --> 02:09:27,088
Not tonight, Willie.

1495
02:09:28,169 --> 02:09:31,248
Say, who is that girl
with the gorgeous red hair?

1496
02:09:31,449 --> 02:09:33,568
Why, that's Billie Burke.

1497
02:09:36,888 --> 02:09:38,608
Thanks, Willie.

1498
02:09:51,688 --> 02:09:55,648
- Good evening, Jack.
- How do you do? Come on.

1499
02:09:57,928 --> 02:09:59,368
Willie.

1500
02:09:59,568 --> 02:10:02,768
- Yes, Flo?
- I'm staying for the Paul Jones.

1501
02:10:02,968 --> 02:10:05,648
Whenever you see me with Miss Burke,
blow the whistle.

1502
02:10:05,808 --> 02:10:07,328
Okay.

1503
02:10:13,488 --> 02:10:16,568
Take your places for the Paul Jones,
everybody.

1504
02:10:16,728 --> 02:10:18,928
The Paul Jones!

1505
02:10:24,888 --> 02:10:28,968
- Well, do you think we ought to? I--
- Oh, yes. I love the Paul Jones.

1506
02:10:29,128 --> 02:10:32,208
- Perhaps we could both go the same way.
- No, we can't do that!

1507
02:10:32,368 --> 02:10:34,448
Oh, Well, I....

1508
02:10:50,168 --> 02:10:51,808
Miss Burke.

1509
02:10:51,968 --> 02:10:53,888
Mister...?

1510
02:10:54,208 --> 02:10:56,007
It doesn't matter.

1511
02:10:57,888 --> 02:11:00,728
Oh, no, I'm supposed to--
I've got to-- We're not--

1512
02:11:00,888 --> 02:11:03,527
- Oh, no, this is our dance.
- Oh, is it?

1513
02:11:48,007 --> 02:11:51,448
- Miss Burke.
- We meet again, Mister...?

1514
02:11:51,608 --> 02:11:53,687
It still doesn't matter.

1515
02:11:53,847 --> 02:11:55,168
Won't you tell me?

1516
02:11:55,327 --> 02:11:57,447
- Tell you what?
- Your name.

1517
02:11:57,607 --> 02:12:01,207
- Why don't you ask Mr. Billings.
- I will, if I can find him.

1518
02:12:01,367 --> 02:12:03,647
But you seem to stand in
with the whistle.

1519
02:12:03,807 --> 02:12:06,927
Oh, yes, when I was a little boy,
I used to love to whistle...

1520
02:12:07,087 --> 02:12:08,728
...and a whistle never forgets.

1521
02:12:18,247 --> 02:12:20,527
- Aren't you getting bored?
- No. Are you?

1522
02:12:20,687 --> 02:12:22,487
- I'm afraid not.
- Tired?

1523
02:12:22,647 --> 02:12:25,967
- Are you?
- No, but I'd much rather just talk.

1524
02:12:26,167 --> 02:12:28,607
- Would you mind?
- No.

1525
02:12:35,687 --> 02:12:37,607
Don't you love the lights of New York?

1526
02:12:37,767 --> 02:12:40,246
For me, they're more beautiful
than any landscape.

1527
02:12:40,407 --> 02:12:43,727
- More beautiful than the mountains?
- Yes, I think so.

1528
02:12:43,887 --> 02:12:48,127
- Are you too cold out here?
- No, indeed. I'm enjoying it.

1529
02:12:48,287 --> 02:12:50,246
That is, I....

1530
02:12:50,406 --> 02:12:53,327
I mean, the electric signs fascinate me.

1531
02:12:53,487 --> 02:12:59,687
"Wrigley's Chewing Gum, Fleischmann's
Yeast, Ziegfeld's Follies."

1532
02:12:59,846 --> 02:13:03,126
- Do you know Ziegfeld?
- No, I don't want to.

1533
02:13:03,286 --> 02:13:06,406
- I understand he's a horrible person.
- Horrible?

1534
02:13:06,566 --> 02:13:10,487
Yes, they say he's a terrible lady's man.
Well, I suppose that's forgivable.

1535
02:13:10,647 --> 02:13:13,047
He's surrounded by so many
beautiful women.

1536
02:13:13,207 --> 02:13:16,127
Yes, yes.
Strange you've never met him.

1537
02:13:16,286 --> 02:13:18,687
I don't want to. I love his shows.

1538
02:13:18,847 --> 02:13:23,087
They're so beautiful and in such good taste.
It would disappoint me to meet him...

1539
02:13:23,247 --> 02:13:26,446
...and find him to be a fat, pudgy man
with a big stomach.

1540
02:13:26,606 --> 02:13:29,927
He's not fat
and not really so pudgy.

1541
02:13:30,087 --> 02:13:32,247
- No? You know him?
- Oh, yes.

1542
02:13:32,407 --> 02:13:34,047
Yes. He would like you.

1543
02:13:34,207 --> 02:13:38,326
- How do you know?
- Didn't you just say he had good taste?

1544
02:13:38,486 --> 02:13:41,246
Well, you're sort of a lady's man yourself,
aren't you?

1545
02:13:41,406 --> 02:13:45,446
I think with you as the lady,
I could make Ziegfeld look like an amateur.

1546
02:13:46,527 --> 02:13:50,286
- You haven't told me your name yet.
- If you don't mind, Mr. Ziegfeld...

1547
02:13:50,446 --> 02:13:53,126
...Miss Burke, with the permission
of her producer...

1548
02:13:53,286 --> 02:13:54,726
...came here with me tonight.

1549
02:13:54,926 --> 02:13:57,686
And if you've no objection,
I'd like to have one dance.

1550
02:13:57,846 --> 02:14:00,926
Mr. Ziegfeld? Well, you were right.
He isn't pudgy.

1551
02:14:01,086 --> 02:14:02,486
- Shall we go in?
- Yes!

1552
02:14:02,646 --> 02:14:05,326
- Don't I get one more dance?
- I'm afraid not.

1553
02:14:05,486 --> 02:14:08,606
I imagine it's Mr. Frohman
you're really afraid of, isn't it?

1554
02:14:08,766 --> 02:14:10,446
- Oh, I'm....
- Perhaps.

1555
02:14:10,606 --> 02:14:12,966
He doesn't want you to appear
too much socially.

1556
02:14:13,166 --> 02:14:14,726
Frankly, no, he doesn't.

1557
02:14:14,886 --> 02:14:17,566
And you don't like me
very well anyway, do you?

1558
02:14:17,726 --> 02:14:21,366
- Frankly, no, I don't.
- No. She doesn't!

1559
02:14:22,846 --> 02:14:26,206
You put him in his place, all right.

1560
02:14:33,846 --> 02:14:37,046
What would Gen. Grant think
if he knew we were using...

1561
02:14:37,206 --> 02:14:40,006
...the very shadow of his tomb
as our meeting place?

1562
02:14:40,166 --> 02:14:44,646
Well, I never knew the general personally,
but I have an idea he'd approve.

1563
02:14:44,806 --> 02:14:48,646
I don't know. Nobody else seems to.
At least, Mr. Frohman doesn't.

1564
02:14:48,806 --> 02:14:50,166
And why not?

1565
02:14:50,326 --> 02:14:53,166
Why can't we meet where we like?
Go where we want?

1566
02:14:53,326 --> 02:14:55,366
Just because he has you
under contract...

1567
02:14:55,526 --> 02:14:58,246
...is no reason he should
dictate your personal life.

1568
02:14:58,406 --> 02:15:01,485
- I'm here.
- Yes, and so am I.

1569
02:15:01,885 --> 02:15:04,326
But it must seem like
kindergarten to you.

1570
02:15:04,525 --> 02:15:05,605
Why?

1571
02:15:05,766 --> 02:15:08,286
The great Mr. Ziegfeld,
producer of the Follies...

1572
02:15:08,446 --> 02:15:10,766
...surrounded by hundreds
of beautiful women...

1573
02:15:10,925 --> 02:15:12,966
...sitting on a bench, holding hands...

1574
02:15:13,165 --> 02:15:15,885
...watching the riverboats
go back and forth.

1575
02:15:16,366 --> 02:15:20,326
- Doesn't sound a bit like you, does it?
- No, it doesn't.

1576
02:15:21,006 --> 02:15:23,165
But here I am, sitting on a bench...

1577
02:15:23,326 --> 02:15:27,005
...holding hands and watching
the riverboats go back and forth.

1578
02:15:27,166 --> 02:15:30,445
And regretting all the years
I haven't known you.

1579
02:15:30,965 --> 02:15:33,886
Didn't Anna Held take up a few
of those years?

1580
02:15:34,046 --> 02:15:35,846
Yes, Billie, she did.

1581
02:15:36,005 --> 02:15:38,525
She was truly a wonderful woman.

1582
02:15:39,165 --> 02:15:41,405
I love you for saying that.

1583
02:15:44,365 --> 02:15:47,925
Look, there's another ferryboat going
across to the Palisades.

1584
02:15:49,485 --> 02:15:52,525
Will you keep your eyes on it
while I tell you something?

1585
02:15:52,686 --> 02:15:54,925
Must I look at a ferryboat
to listen to you?

1586
02:15:55,085 --> 02:15:57,725
Yes, or I won't be able to tell you.

1587
02:15:58,285 --> 02:16:01,205
You mean the great lady's man
is bashful?

1588
02:16:01,365 --> 02:16:04,606
Strange as it may seem,
in your presence, he is.

1589
02:16:07,245 --> 02:16:09,205
All right, I'm looking.

1590
02:16:10,965 --> 02:16:12,365
I love you, Billie.

1591
02:16:12,525 --> 02:16:14,206
The ferryboat.

1592
02:16:15,405 --> 02:16:19,645
I haven't anything to offer you, because
there's nothing you really seem to need.

1593
02:16:19,805 --> 02:16:24,365
You've made the most of yourself
unassisted, and that's grand.

1594
02:16:24,525 --> 02:16:26,085
Ferryboat.

1595
02:16:27,685 --> 02:16:32,005
You're a great star already,
so there's little I can offer you.

1596
02:16:32,165 --> 02:16:36,445
Nothing I can give you,
except my love.

1597
02:16:41,005 --> 02:16:42,765
That isn't enough.

1598
02:16:43,445 --> 02:16:48,044
I'd expect part of your ambition,
half of your trouble...

1599
02:16:48,205 --> 02:16:52,564
...two-thirds of your worries
and all of your respect.

1600
02:17:18,405 --> 02:17:20,645
Here's your medicine, madame.

1601
02:17:20,804 --> 02:17:23,564
No, thank you, Marie.
I'm tired of it.

1602
02:17:23,725 --> 02:17:26,724
- But, madame....
- No, no, no, no.

1603
02:17:27,804 --> 02:17:29,724
Perhaps you would like
to go to Paris?

1604
02:17:29,884 --> 02:17:35,565
No, I'm too tired to go anywhere
and to do anything.

1605
02:17:37,644 --> 02:17:39,164
Marie....

1606
02:17:41,965 --> 02:17:43,964
Look at the paper...

1607
02:17:44,124 --> 02:17:48,204
...and tell me where did they go
on their honeymoon?

1608
02:17:48,364 --> 02:17:50,244
But they couldn't go anywhere,
madame.

1609
02:17:50,404 --> 02:17:52,364
Miss Burke is appearing in a play here.

1610
02:17:52,525 --> 02:17:54,564
We saw her only two weeks ago.

1611
02:17:54,964 --> 02:17:57,605
You insisted, madame.
You remember.

1612
02:17:57,765 --> 02:18:01,244
Oui, I know. And we enjoyed it
very much too.

1613
02:18:01,404 --> 02:18:04,404
She's a lovely actress, Marie, oui?

1614
02:18:05,804 --> 02:18:08,524
She has such twinkling eyes...

1615
02:18:08,684 --> 02:18:13,324
...and such a funny little twitter
when she speaks.

1616
02:18:15,165 --> 02:18:21,364
Yes, I can well imagine
Flo being in love with her.

1617
02:18:23,684 --> 02:18:24,804
Marie?

1618
02:18:25,804 --> 02:18:29,204
Call his office.
I will congratulate him.

1619
02:18:33,284 --> 02:18:36,324
Hello? Brian 3093, please.

1620
02:18:36,484 --> 02:18:39,084
I should wish him luck, oui?

1621
02:18:39,244 --> 02:18:42,563
- Oui, I should.
- Mr. Ziegfeld, please.

1622
02:18:42,724 --> 02:18:45,964
- Miss Anna Held speaking.
- No, Marie, hang up!

1623
02:18:46,124 --> 02:18:49,404
- I cannot speak with him today!
- Mr. Ziegfeld?

1624
02:18:50,004 --> 02:18:52,244
He's on the telephone, madame.

1625
02:18:52,924 --> 02:18:54,604
He is?

1626
02:19:03,204 --> 02:19:05,084
Hello, Flo.

1627
02:19:05,964 --> 02:19:08,364
Yes, here's Anna.

1628
02:19:09,163 --> 02:19:11,763
I'm so happy for you today.

1629
02:19:11,924 --> 02:19:16,324
I could not help but call on you
and congratulate you.

1630
02:19:17,803 --> 02:19:21,724
Wonderful, Flo.
Never better in my whole life.

1631
02:19:21,883 --> 02:19:25,603
I'm so excited about my new plans.
I'm going to Paris.

1632
02:19:25,763 --> 02:19:28,964
Yes, for a few weeks,
and then I can get back...

1633
02:19:29,124 --> 02:19:31,523
...and then I'm doing a new show,
and I--

1634
02:19:31,724 --> 02:19:35,763
Oui, it's all so wonderful.
I'm so happy.

1635
02:19:35,924 --> 02:19:40,003
Yes, and I hope you are happy too.

1636
02:19:40,484 --> 02:19:42,043
Yes?

1637
02:19:42,804 --> 02:19:46,364
I'm so glad for you, Flo.

1638
02:19:49,603 --> 02:19:55,404
It sounds funny for ex-husband and ex-wife
to tell each other how happy they are, oui?

1639
02:19:55,564 --> 02:19:57,764
Yes, Flo.

1640
02:20:00,043 --> 02:20:02,643
Goodbye, Flo.

1641
02:20:04,044 --> 02:20:05,923
Goodbye.

1642
02:20:22,284 --> 02:20:26,963
If you love him so much,
why did you divorce him?

1643
02:20:28,003 --> 02:20:32,363
Because I thought it would
bring him back to me.

1644
02:20:32,523 --> 02:20:37,723
I was sure that it would
bring him back to me.

1645
02:20:49,163 --> 02:20:53,003
Goody, goody, goody!
Is that all for me?

1646
02:20:53,163 --> 02:20:57,083
That certainly is, every bit for you.
And that isn't all. Sidney?

1647
02:20:57,243 --> 02:20:58,363
Yes, sir?

1648
02:20:58,523 --> 02:21:01,283
Now, if you don't like the view
from this side...

1649
02:21:01,443 --> 02:21:03,723
- ...then--
- I don't.

1650
02:21:03,883 --> 02:21:06,923
- That's the chimney Santa came down.
- Yes!

1651
02:21:07,083 --> 02:21:11,123
- That's where the reindeer stopped.
- I wonder how they kept from sliding off.

1652
02:21:11,283 --> 02:21:13,962
Probably the bricks stopped them.

1653
02:21:14,642 --> 02:21:17,323
See, Mommy, it's almost big enough
for me to get in.

1654
02:21:17,483 --> 02:21:20,363
- It is!
- It's almost big enough for us all to get in.

1655
02:21:20,522 --> 02:21:23,043
- Oh, yes! Sidney....
- Yes, sir?

1656
02:21:23,203 --> 02:21:25,363
Hasn't Santa Claus brought
the elephant yet?

1657
02:21:25,523 --> 02:21:29,403
Not yet, sir, but he, she-- It may
be here at any moment, sir.

1658
02:21:29,562 --> 02:21:31,522
- You didn't buy an elephant?
- I did.

1659
02:21:31,683 --> 02:21:36,123
- A live elephant, Daddy?
- A great big, live elephant.

1660
02:21:36,282 --> 02:21:39,083
I beg your pardon, sir, madam.

1661
02:21:39,243 --> 02:21:42,243
In behalf of the help,
and as their spokesman...

1662
02:21:42,403 --> 02:21:46,083
...I wish to express our thanks
for your thoughtfulness and generosity...

1663
02:21:46,243 --> 02:21:48,362
...and to wish you a very
merry Christmas.

1664
02:21:48,522 --> 02:21:50,522
- Thank you.
- That's very nice, Sidney.

1665
02:21:50,682 --> 02:21:53,682
And may we wish a very
merry Christmas to all of you.

1666
02:21:53,842 --> 02:21:56,842
Thank you, sir. Thank you, madam.
Merry Christmas.

1667
02:21:57,642 --> 02:22:00,042
And to you, Miss Patricia.

1668
02:22:01,482 --> 02:22:02,803
Same to you, Sidney.

1669
02:22:03,243 --> 02:22:05,122
Now, how about opening
your presents?

1670
02:22:05,283 --> 02:22:07,883
With all this extravagance,
I'm a little afraid to.

1671
02:22:08,042 --> 02:22:10,442
Nonsense, darling,
that's what Christmas is for.

1672
02:22:10,602 --> 02:22:12,322
Come on, now.

1673
02:22:13,643 --> 02:22:15,762
- Oh, Flo.
- Now.

1674
02:22:15,922 --> 02:22:19,442
- This isn't all for me?
- Well, who else?

1675
02:22:20,482 --> 02:22:25,322
- I don't know which one to open first.
- Well, suppose you try this one.

1676
02:22:26,362 --> 02:22:28,922
Oh, Flo!

1677
02:22:29,082 --> 02:22:31,362
A crown of diamonds.

1678
02:22:31,522 --> 02:22:33,762
How beautiful.

1679
02:22:33,922 --> 02:22:36,562
This proves that America
is not a republic.

1680
02:22:36,722 --> 02:22:41,482
Because you are the queen,
and queens always wear crowns.

1681
02:22:43,442 --> 02:22:46,402
A bracelet for the regal wrist.

1682
02:22:48,041 --> 02:22:50,842
A pendant for the royal throat.

1683
02:22:51,002 --> 02:22:53,602
- And....
- Flo!

1684
02:22:53,922 --> 02:22:56,962
A cloak for Her Majesty's shoulders.

1685
02:22:57,122 --> 02:22:58,762
- Darling!
- And....

1686
02:22:58,922 --> 02:23:01,402
- Oh, no, Flo. Nothing else!
- Yes.

1687
02:23:01,562 --> 02:23:05,082
A kiss from her most humble subject.

1688
02:23:06,722 --> 02:23:08,402
Darling!

1689
02:23:08,762 --> 02:23:11,201
Oh, everything's so lovely.

1690
02:23:11,682 --> 02:23:15,362
- But you shouldn't have done so much.
- Oh, well, I....

1691
02:23:16,082 --> 02:23:17,842
I hadn't anything to do with it.

1692
02:23:18,002 --> 02:23:20,162
It was Santa Claus.
He brought everything.

1693
02:23:20,322 --> 02:23:23,681
Yes, I know, but Santa Claus
was far too extravagant.

1694
02:23:25,002 --> 02:23:26,762
You should take some of it back.

1695
02:23:26,922 --> 02:23:30,921
Oh, Mama, I don't want Santa Claus
to take back any of my presents.

1696
02:23:31,241 --> 02:23:32,642
Don't worry, he won't.

1697
02:23:32,841 --> 02:23:35,562
No, and he won't take back
any of your mama's either.

1698
02:23:35,721 --> 02:23:38,002
I'd cry if he took my circus back.

1699
02:23:38,162 --> 02:23:39,441
- You would?
- Why, darling?

1700
02:23:39,601 --> 02:23:44,202
- You like it better than your other presents?
- But I wish it was a real, live circus.

1701
02:23:44,361 --> 02:23:46,762
Well, I guess you'll have to do
a circus, Flo.

1702
02:23:46,922 --> 02:23:48,402
Could you, Daddy?

1703
02:23:48,562 --> 02:23:50,241
Well, I don't know. Let's see.

1704
02:23:50,401 --> 02:23:52,682
I've never had any experience
with circuses.

1705
02:23:52,841 --> 02:23:54,281
But I can try.

1706
02:23:54,442 --> 02:23:57,921
I'll tell you what. Let's make a chorus
in front of these two wagons.

1707
02:23:58,081 --> 02:24:03,202
Who's this fellow? That's the ringmaster
in the center, where a ringmaster should be.

1708
02:24:03,362 --> 02:24:05,962
Now, we'll put these two acrobats
up next to him...

1709
02:24:06,122 --> 02:24:10,082
...then we'll put this Tyrollean fellow
there. Put the clown next to him.

1710
02:24:10,241 --> 02:24:12,641
He's a funny fellow,
and there's the lion-tamer.

1711
02:24:12,802 --> 02:24:16,802
Gosh, I bet he's a brave fellow too.
And there's the drum major.

1712
02:24:16,961 --> 02:24:20,721
And here is the strongman.
We'll call him Sandow.

1713
02:24:20,881 --> 02:24:23,321
- And who is this?
- Well, that's....

1714
02:24:23,481 --> 02:24:26,001
Oh! Of course.
That's little Harriet Hoctor.

1715
02:24:26,161 --> 02:24:28,321
I've always wanted
to give her a chance.

1716
02:24:28,481 --> 02:24:33,001
I'll tell you what. Now, you hold her for a
minute, and we'll bring her on later. Now...

1717
02:24:33,161 --> 02:24:36,601
...let's put it all back of a curtain,
just as I do in the theater.

1718
02:24:36,761 --> 02:24:39,281
Now, this is the curtain.

1719
02:33:12,677 --> 02:33:15,197
- What's the laugh, Jack?
- This article on Ziegfeld.

1720
02:33:15,397 --> 02:33:18,237
Says he's broke and can't
borrow a nickel from any bank.

1721
02:33:18,397 --> 02:33:20,877
He wouldn't have to borrow
if he'd commercialized.

1722
02:33:21,037 --> 02:33:23,397
He'd never send out
a number two company.

1723
02:33:23,557 --> 02:33:25,917
He wanted the public to see
his best production.

1724
02:33:26,117 --> 02:33:29,597
Why doesn't he stick to his Follies?
That other show is terrible.

1725
02:33:29,757 --> 02:33:32,997
- Guess the old boy's washed-up.
- He's been slipping for years.

1726
02:33:33,157 --> 02:33:36,517
- White and Carroll have got it all over him.
- Bob....

1727
02:33:36,676 --> 02:33:38,637
Let me have a cold towel, will you?

1728
02:33:38,797 --> 02:33:40,197
Well, the guy's getting old.

1729
02:33:40,357 --> 02:33:43,557
Yeah, and broke. He won't
have another hit on Broadway.

1730
02:33:43,717 --> 02:33:47,677
- Isn't someone making a theater for him?
- Yeah. It's to be his monument.

1731
02:33:48,117 --> 02:33:50,957
It's about time.
He could use a monument.

1732
02:33:52,677 --> 02:33:56,156
- I don't know you fellows.
- You got nothing on me. I don't know you.

1733
02:33:56,317 --> 02:34:00,757
You ought to. You've been burying me
for five minutes. I'm Ziegfeld. You're right.

1734
02:34:00,916 --> 02:34:04,516
I'm not gonna have another hit
on Broadway. I'm gonna have four.

1735
02:34:04,677 --> 02:34:06,996
Four at one time.
You get that? Four!

1736
02:34:07,157 --> 02:34:09,276
And all hits.

1737
02:34:11,076 --> 02:34:12,996
Oh, Mr. Ziegfeld!

1738
02:34:13,396 --> 02:34:14,877
You forgot your tie.

1739
02:34:15,036 --> 02:34:18,437
He's gonna have four hits,
and he hasn't got a tie left.

1740
02:34:24,116 --> 02:34:25,677
Flo.

1741
02:34:26,316 --> 02:34:27,956
Darling.

1742
02:34:29,036 --> 02:34:33,357
Why did you come upstairs without
saying hello? Are you trying to elude me?

1743
02:34:34,116 --> 02:34:37,037
Well, I'm not feeling very well, dear.

1744
02:34:37,556 --> 02:34:40,197
Poor darling. You're just tired.

1745
02:34:40,357 --> 02:34:42,117
Where's your tie?

1746
02:34:45,436 --> 02:34:47,516
What do you think of that? I....

1747
02:34:47,956 --> 02:34:50,796
I must have left it
in the barbershop this afternoon.

1748
02:34:51,317 --> 02:34:53,956
And you've been around
without it ever since?

1749
02:34:54,756 --> 02:34:57,436
Darling, that isn't like you.

1750
02:34:57,836 --> 02:34:59,556
What's wrong, Flo?

1751
02:35:01,796 --> 02:35:03,517
Billie, I'm all through.

1752
02:35:03,676 --> 02:35:06,596
- Through with what?
- Everything. I'm slipping. I'm...

1753
02:35:06,756 --> 02:35:08,356
...getting old.

1754
02:35:08,636 --> 02:35:10,516
And who told you that?

1755
02:35:10,796 --> 02:35:15,076
- Three men in the barbershop.
- That's why you forgot your tie.

1756
02:35:15,236 --> 02:35:18,236
Yes, I've never done anything
like that in my whole life.

1757
02:35:18,396 --> 02:35:22,916
Isn't that tragic? For the first time
in your long career, you forgot a tie.

1758
02:35:23,076 --> 02:35:24,636
It's a calamity.

1759
02:35:29,716 --> 02:35:33,795
- Who were those men, Flo?
- I don't know. I never saw them before.

1760
02:35:34,556 --> 02:35:37,436
They said I'd never produce another hit.

1761
02:35:38,276 --> 02:35:40,235
And what did you say?

1762
02:35:40,596 --> 02:35:43,876
I told them I'd have four on Broadway
at the same time.

1763
02:35:44,036 --> 02:35:48,236
- Sounds more like you.
- Yeah, but it was only a bluff.

1764
02:35:49,916 --> 02:35:52,756
I'm sorry, dear.
I don't mean to worry you.

1765
02:35:54,235 --> 02:35:55,916
Where's Patricia?

1766
02:35:56,236 --> 02:35:58,276
She's having her dinner.

1767
02:35:59,555 --> 02:36:03,316
- You came home very late, dear.
- Yes, dear. I'm sorry. I....

1768
02:36:04,036 --> 02:36:06,036
I've been so worried.

1769
02:36:06,356 --> 02:36:09,196
The play is such a terrible failure.

1770
02:36:09,516 --> 02:36:11,475
But you're not, darling.

1771
02:36:12,475 --> 02:36:14,036
Afraid I am.

1772
02:36:15,315 --> 02:36:19,116
- Well, shall we have some dinner?
- Flo.

1773
02:36:19,275 --> 02:36:21,195
I'm disappointed in you.

1774
02:36:21,355 --> 02:36:24,355
I didn't think you'd ever lose
confidence in yourself.

1775
02:36:24,915 --> 02:36:26,916
But I must be the failure, not you.

1776
02:36:27,076 --> 02:36:29,755
- Oh, Billie.
- No, I mean it, darling.

1777
02:36:29,916 --> 02:36:31,556
Before we were married...

1778
02:36:31,716 --> 02:36:35,276
...you never thought of failure
even when you were broke.

1779
02:36:35,556 --> 02:36:38,875
It was your sublime superiority
more than anything else...

1780
02:36:39,075 --> 02:36:42,956
...that made me admire you so much.
Please don't change, Flo.

1781
02:36:43,435 --> 02:36:46,356
Don't let Patricia and me
become a worry to you.

1782
02:36:46,595 --> 02:36:49,475
We don't expect you
to reduce your life to just us.

1783
02:36:49,755 --> 02:36:53,875
I want you to go right on
being just as you always were.

1784
02:36:54,755 --> 02:36:56,715
I would never be jealous...

1785
02:36:56,995 --> 02:37:01,195
...because with your love of beauty,
you could never be cheap or common.

1786
02:37:01,675 --> 02:37:04,596
So in whatever you do...

1787
02:37:04,755 --> 02:37:06,835
...you need never fear me.

1788
02:37:06,995 --> 02:37:08,835
And what is more important...

1789
02:37:09,235 --> 02:37:11,515
...don't be afraid of yourself.

1790
02:37:16,995 --> 02:37:18,635
I'm not gonna be afraid, Billie.

1791
02:37:18,915 --> 02:37:22,115
All right, young man.
I'll give you a chance to prove it.

1792
02:37:22,275 --> 02:37:25,475
In my vault, I have all the jewelry
you've ever given me...

1793
02:37:25,635 --> 02:37:27,835
...even the queen's crown...

1794
02:37:28,115 --> 02:37:30,395
...and some very good bonds.

1795
02:37:30,555 --> 02:37:32,195
They're all yours...

1796
02:37:32,515 --> 02:37:34,075
...on one condition.

1797
02:37:34,235 --> 02:37:38,875
That you keep your promise to those
three men and have four hits on Broadway.

1798
02:37:39,075 --> 02:37:42,235
- Is that a bargain?
- Oh, Billie.

1799
02:38:27,554 --> 02:38:29,314
Mr. Ziegfeld.

1800
02:38:29,474 --> 02:38:31,074
Just a minute.

1801
02:38:31,514 --> 02:38:35,234
Mr. Ziegfeld, it's Police Inspector Doyle.
He says it's important.

1802
02:38:35,395 --> 02:38:38,194
- Why didn't you say so? Send him in.
- All right.

1803
02:38:40,994 --> 02:38:42,994
All right, Mr. Doyle.

1804
02:38:44,834 --> 02:38:46,394
Mr. Ziegfeld.

1805
02:38:47,634 --> 02:38:48,914
Hello, inspector.

1806
02:38:49,074 --> 02:38:51,674
- We got them, all right.
- You did? That's wonderful.

1807
02:38:51,835 --> 02:38:54,514
It is wonderful,
with the descriptions you gave us.

1808
02:38:54,674 --> 02:38:56,474
- Where are they?
- Right outside.

1809
02:38:56,635 --> 02:38:58,954
- Bring them in.
- All right, sir.

1810
02:39:00,475 --> 02:39:01,834
Bring those birds in here.

1811
02:39:06,154 --> 02:39:08,074
- Here they are.
- What's going on?

1812
02:39:08,234 --> 02:39:12,114
- Pipe down, pipe down.
- What's the charge against these men?

1813
02:39:12,275 --> 02:39:14,714
- Murder.
- Murder?

1814
02:39:14,914 --> 02:39:16,795
Yes, murder.

1815
02:39:16,994 --> 02:39:20,474
About a year ago, these three gentlemen
killed me and buried me.

1816
02:39:20,635 --> 02:39:24,234
- Killed? Buried?
- Yes. In a Times Square barbershop.

1817
02:39:24,394 --> 02:39:27,154
- Remember?
- Oh, yes, I remember. Don't you?

1818
02:39:27,314 --> 02:39:31,554
Now, I'm going to give each of you
a box to all four of my shows.

1819
02:39:31,714 --> 02:39:33,914
Four hits, all in one season.

1820
02:39:34,074 --> 02:39:38,274
And then I want you to tell me whether
or not you still think I'm washed-up.

1821
02:39:38,474 --> 02:39:41,274
I'm sorry, but this is the only way
I could locate you.

1822
02:39:41,434 --> 02:39:45,514
I knew that if you were to be found at all,
Inspector Doyle was the one to do it.

1823
02:39:45,954 --> 02:39:49,994
Sam, have Goldie take their reservations
for whatever nights they wish.

1824
02:39:50,154 --> 02:39:51,714
- Good day, gentlemen.
- This way.

1825
02:39:51,873 --> 02:39:54,594
- Thank you.
- That's getting even with a vengeance.

1826
02:39:54,753 --> 02:39:58,434
That's not a bad ending
for a practical joke, is it?

1827
02:39:59,153 --> 02:40:02,554
Goldie, take these gentlemen's
names and addresses.

1828
02:40:05,114 --> 02:40:08,034
Don't you realize what you
may have let yourself in for?

1829
02:40:08,193 --> 02:40:10,314
- What?
- They can sue you for false arrest.

1830
02:40:10,474 --> 02:40:13,833
- And the police department.
- Don't you realize we have nothing...

1831
02:40:13,994 --> 02:40:15,993
- ...to worry about anymore?
- I hope so.

1832
02:40:16,194 --> 02:40:18,593
No need to hope.
You know what I've been doing?

1833
02:40:18,753 --> 02:40:21,794
- What?
- Buying stocks. I've bought over a million.

1834
02:40:21,954 --> 02:40:24,674
- Outright?
- No, on margin.

1835
02:40:24,834 --> 02:40:26,794
But all solid securities.

1836
02:40:26,953 --> 02:40:30,393
When I've paid for them, I'm gonna
buy another million and another.

1837
02:40:30,553 --> 02:40:34,434
- Sam, I'm going to be really rich.
- I hope you're right, sir.

1838
02:40:34,594 --> 02:40:38,154
But the market's been behaving
very queerly these last few days.

1839
02:40:39,953 --> 02:40:42,153
- Yes?
- Croydon & Company on the phone.

1840
02:40:42,313 --> 02:40:44,513
- Put them on.
- Been trying to get you.

1841
02:40:44,673 --> 02:40:47,353
They're my broker. Hello? Speaking.

1842
02:40:50,153 --> 02:40:52,633
Oh. Well, what happened?

1843
02:40:54,073 --> 02:40:56,553
Down 20 to 40 points?

1844
02:40:58,473 --> 02:41:00,033
How much?

1845
02:41:00,673 --> 02:41:03,593
- Three hundred thousand?!
- What is it?

1846
02:41:05,473 --> 02:41:06,993
Oh, no, no, no! Don't do that!

1847
02:41:07,153 --> 02:41:10,673
I'll cover. I'll get the money
to you in just a little while.

1848
02:41:10,833 --> 02:41:13,713
- Will you put Holloway on the phone?
- Flo, what is it?

1849
02:41:13,873 --> 02:41:16,073
The market, Sam, it's crashed.

1850
02:41:16,273 --> 02:41:18,593
I've got to get $300,000
in cash, immediately.

1851
02:41:18,753 --> 02:41:20,793
- How are we gonna do it?
- I don't know.

1852
02:41:20,953 --> 02:41:24,033
- Maybe I could borrow it from a bank.
- On what?

1853
02:41:24,194 --> 02:41:25,913
On your shows.

1854
02:41:26,073 --> 02:41:30,313
It's too late. I've already mortgaged the
shows for the first payments on the stock.

1855
02:41:30,673 --> 02:41:32,233
What's that?

1856
02:41:32,513 --> 02:41:34,513
But you've got to locate him!

1857
02:41:34,673 --> 02:41:38,553
Yes, I'll cover. I'll get the money to you
in a while. Just hold the wire.

1858
02:41:38,713 --> 02:41:40,153
- Sam, get Billings.
- Yes, sir.

1859
02:41:40,353 --> 02:41:43,153
Try his house, his office,
anywhere, but get Billings!

1860
02:41:52,633 --> 02:41:56,353
Mr. Nagus, we haven't received your check,
and your margin's wiped out.

1861
02:41:56,513 --> 02:42:00,112
Hello, Mr. Billings. I'll be right with you.
No, we can't, Mr. Nagus.

1862
02:42:00,273 --> 02:42:03,193
I'm sorry, but we can't hold
your stocks any longer.

1863
02:42:03,353 --> 02:42:05,633
Mr. Billings, we've had
to sell you out too.

1864
02:42:05,793 --> 02:42:09,152
Well, that takes me back
to my second childhood consistently.

1865
02:42:09,313 --> 02:42:11,352
I was a poor kid when I started.

1866
02:42:11,553 --> 02:42:15,513
- Mr. Ziegfeld's on number six for you.
- Excuse me, Mr. Billings.

1867
02:42:15,872 --> 02:42:19,233
Hello? Oh, yes, Mr. Ziegfeld.

1868
02:42:19,633 --> 02:42:22,393
Yes, we had to sell you out
about half an hour ago.

1869
02:42:23,073 --> 02:42:24,313
Yes.

1870
02:42:24,472 --> 02:42:27,112
I know it is, and I'm terribly sorry.

1871
02:42:27,273 --> 02:42:30,272
- I didn't know Ziegfeld was in the market.
- Yes, very heavy.

1872
02:42:30,433 --> 02:42:32,393
- He'll lose everything.
- Everything?

1873
02:42:32,553 --> 02:42:34,033
Everything.

1874
02:42:34,193 --> 02:42:37,713
Well, this is one time
he can't get it from me.

1875
02:43:31,752 --> 02:43:34,592
Yes, madam. Yes, madam, it is.

1876
02:43:34,912 --> 02:43:37,672
The doctor left
about 10 minutes ago, madam.

1877
02:43:38,152 --> 02:43:40,872
He seemed very happy
about Mr. Ziegfeld.

1878
02:43:41,032 --> 02:43:43,232
Said he might stay up for a while longer.

1879
02:43:43,392 --> 02:43:47,032
Oh, he did so enjoy sitting up to dinner
with you and Miss Patricia.

1880
02:43:47,632 --> 02:43:50,512
- No, madam.
- But don't let him stay up too long.

1881
02:43:50,672 --> 02:43:54,471
Yes, I know, but the more he rests,
the sooner he'll be well again.

1882
02:43:56,632 --> 02:43:59,831
And tell him I'll be home
immediately after the performance.

1883
02:43:59,992 --> 02:44:02,632
- It's time for your entrance, Miss Burke.
- Yes, yes.

1884
02:44:02,792 --> 02:44:05,711
Sidney, be sure to call me
right after the second act.

1885
02:44:05,872 --> 02:44:07,351
Yes, about 10:05.

1886
02:44:07,712 --> 02:44:09,232
Yes, madam.

1887
02:44:13,312 --> 02:44:15,832
Madam was very happy about you, sir.

1888
02:44:20,791 --> 02:44:22,392
Oh, my poor Billie.

1889
02:44:24,872 --> 02:44:27,231
I wish she weren't working.

1890
02:44:29,232 --> 02:44:31,712
But it does help some, Sidney.

1891
02:44:32,352 --> 02:44:35,552
- Get those wires off as quickly as you can.
- Yes, sir.

1892
02:44:35,711 --> 02:44:38,432
Were you able to reach
Eddie Cantor by phone?

1893
02:44:38,591 --> 02:44:41,511
The Los Angeles operator's
been trying for some time, sir.

1894
02:44:41,672 --> 02:44:43,912
Tell her to keep on trying.

1895
02:44:44,111 --> 02:44:45,991
- Sidney?
- Yes, sir?

1896
02:44:46,151 --> 02:44:47,752
When you get him...

1897
02:44:47,911 --> 02:44:51,032
...tell him that I want him
for a new show.

1898
02:44:51,191 --> 02:44:56,191
Tell him I'll start rehearsals the instant
he can get away from those pictures.

1899
02:44:56,512 --> 02:44:58,471
Tell him I need him.

1900
02:44:58,631 --> 02:45:02,871
- I haven't had a real show in two years.
- Yes, sir.

1901
02:45:05,791 --> 02:45:08,631
- Wasn't that the bell, Sidney?
- Yes, sir.

1902
02:45:08,832 --> 02:45:10,671
Well, why don't you answer it.

1903
02:45:10,831 --> 02:45:12,311
Yes, sir.

1904
02:45:18,111 --> 02:45:20,591
- Mr. Billings.
- Hello, Sidney.

1905
02:45:20,752 --> 02:45:22,631
How's Mr. Ziegfeld?

1906
02:45:23,391 --> 02:45:26,071
Well, he's much improved, sir,
but he's very nervous.

1907
02:45:26,231 --> 02:45:28,671
He will be glad to see you, sir.

1908
02:45:28,831 --> 02:45:31,191
If we could get him
started on a new show, sir.

1909
02:45:31,351 --> 02:45:34,271
- Yeah.
- I mean to say, if he had the money, sir.

1910
02:45:34,431 --> 02:45:37,151
Yes, well, we'll see that he gets it.

1911
02:45:40,031 --> 02:45:42,711
My valet isn't as efficient
as you used to be, Sidney.

1912
02:45:42,871 --> 02:45:46,551
He lets me neglect things.
All right for me to see him?

1913
02:45:46,711 --> 02:45:49,671
- Yes, sir. I wouldn't stay too long.
- No, no, no.

1914
02:45:50,910 --> 02:45:54,711
Well, hello, Ziggy.
How are you feeling?

1915
02:45:55,391 --> 02:45:57,111
Hello, Jack.

1916
02:45:57,951 --> 02:45:59,831
I'm feeling much better.

1917
02:46:00,031 --> 02:46:02,311
- Thank you. Sit down, won't you?
- Yes.

1918
02:46:02,471 --> 02:46:04,551
Let me look at you.

1919
02:46:05,631 --> 02:46:11,470
I don't think you've been sick. Just playing
possum so your creditors can't find you.

1920
02:46:14,031 --> 02:46:15,310
No.

1921
02:46:15,471 --> 02:46:16,830
No creditors.

1922
02:46:16,991 --> 02:46:18,870
No. No creditors.

1923
02:46:20,510 --> 02:46:23,471
- When are you gonna be up and around?
- Well...

1924
02:46:23,871 --> 02:46:26,270
- ...pretty soon now, I hope.
- Hurry up.

1925
02:46:26,430 --> 02:46:28,951
I'm expecting you
to go to Europe with me.

1926
02:46:29,111 --> 02:46:31,031
Oh. Well, when are you sailing?

1927
02:46:31,190 --> 02:46:34,471
In a couple of weeks.
We'll stop off at Monte Carlo.

1928
02:46:34,630 --> 02:46:37,151
You can break the bank again.

1929
02:46:38,431 --> 02:46:43,511
And then we'll go to London. Maybe
we can find some new talent together.

1930
02:46:43,710 --> 02:46:45,190
Does it interest you?

1931
02:46:45,350 --> 02:46:48,190
Yes. Yes, I'd like to go to London.

1932
02:46:48,350 --> 02:46:49,870
Yeah? Why?

1933
02:46:50,031 --> 02:46:53,030
- You got someone in mind?
- No.

1934
02:46:54,270 --> 02:46:57,910
- Why, have you?
- No.

1935
02:46:58,070 --> 02:47:02,671
But I wouldn't tell you if I had,
not if you were 10 times as sick as you are.

1936
02:47:07,871 --> 02:47:10,631
Oh, those were great old days, Jack.

1937
02:47:10,790 --> 02:47:12,350
Yeah.

1938
02:47:12,630 --> 02:47:14,430
Remember the fair?

1939
02:47:14,750 --> 02:47:17,710
Do I. Little Egypt.

1940
02:47:18,630 --> 02:47:21,311
- Sandow.
- Yeah, and then Anna Held.

1941
02:47:22,750 --> 02:47:24,471
Yes.

1942
02:47:25,070 --> 02:47:27,950
Oh, I'm sorry, Ziggy.

1943
02:47:29,630 --> 02:47:33,070
Why is it, Jack, that in a world so old...

1944
02:47:34,150 --> 02:47:35,710
...life must be so short?

1945
02:47:35,870 --> 02:47:39,310
Short? I feel as if
I'd been here 1000 years.

1946
02:47:39,470 --> 02:47:41,630
And I'm gonna stay 1000 more.

1947
02:47:41,790 --> 02:47:46,230
And you'd feel the same way if you'd
snap out of it and get a new show started.

1948
02:47:47,150 --> 02:47:48,750
Yes.

1949
02:47:49,950 --> 02:47:52,270
Yes, I'd like to do another Follies.

1950
02:47:52,430 --> 02:47:53,910
Why don't you do it.

1951
02:47:54,070 --> 02:47:58,430
Don't you think it's about time
that you and I split 50-50 in something?

1952
02:47:58,590 --> 02:48:00,310
I'd love to, Jack.

1953
02:48:00,870 --> 02:48:02,550
But it'll take a lot of money.

1954
02:48:03,230 --> 02:48:05,270
I've never refused you before, have I?

1955
02:48:05,470 --> 02:48:07,070
No, but...

1956
02:48:07,550 --> 02:48:11,030
...that was all in the dark ages.

1957
02:48:11,550 --> 02:48:14,390
Before the Depression, I mean.

1958
02:48:16,070 --> 02:48:21,749
- I heard that the market got you.
- Me? Why, I.... Don't be silly.

1959
02:48:21,990 --> 02:48:23,990
I'm too smart for any stock market.

1960
02:48:24,150 --> 02:48:29,350
Oh, I lost a couple of thousand or so,
but I got out in time.

1961
02:48:29,510 --> 02:48:31,510
- Really?
- Yeah.

1962
02:48:31,710 --> 02:48:34,229
How about you? Did it get you?

1963
02:48:34,430 --> 02:48:36,190
Oh, no. No, I....

1964
02:48:36,350 --> 02:48:38,189
I never played the market.

1965
02:48:38,990 --> 02:48:43,190
Oh, I may have dropped
a few hundred, maybe...

1966
02:48:43,389 --> 02:48:45,550
...but nothing to speak of.

1967
02:48:48,670 --> 02:48:52,270
Well, how much money
do you suppose it'll take, Ziggy?

1968
02:48:53,630 --> 02:48:57,349
- A couple of hundred thousand.
- A couple of hundred thousand?

1969
02:48:57,629 --> 02:49:00,789
Well, okay, it's a deal.

1970
02:49:00,949 --> 02:49:03,910
Pull yourself together, get well,
and I'll give you money.

1971
02:49:04,069 --> 02:49:07,870
Isn't that wonderful, Mr. Ziegfeld?
Doesn't that make you feel better, sir?

1972
02:49:08,030 --> 02:49:10,829
Yes, that makes me feel much better.

1973
02:49:11,030 --> 02:49:12,629
Jack...

1974
02:49:13,029 --> 02:49:15,390
...you're a real person.

1975
02:49:15,589 --> 02:49:17,229
Yeah, well, you're....

1976
02:49:17,389 --> 02:49:20,190
You're not a bad sort yourself, Ziggy.

1977
02:49:21,789 --> 02:49:23,829
Well, I'll drop in tomorrow.

1978
02:49:23,989 --> 02:49:26,549
Yes. Do that.

1979
02:49:26,709 --> 02:49:31,909
And, Ziggy, if you just put your mind to it,
I think you'll be up and around in a week.

1980
02:49:32,069 --> 02:49:35,469
Don't let me rush you, because
while you're here convalescing...

1981
02:49:35,629 --> 02:49:39,189
...I'll be picking out the gals
for the new show.

1982
02:49:44,069 --> 02:49:47,669
- Well, he looks all right to me, Sidney.
- Undoubtedly he will be, sir.

1983
02:49:47,829 --> 02:49:49,189
Thanks to you.

1984
02:49:49,349 --> 02:49:51,149
I hope so.

1985
02:49:51,669 --> 02:49:53,549
Take good care of him, Sidney.

1986
02:49:53,709 --> 02:49:57,909
Because if anything happened
to Ziggy, I....

1987
02:49:59,029 --> 02:50:01,669
Well, take good care of him.

1988
02:50:17,189 --> 02:50:19,029
Mr. Ziegfeld.

1989
02:50:21,989 --> 02:50:23,629
Mr. Ziegfeld.

1990
02:50:23,869 --> 02:50:26,589
I wouldn't tax my strength
if I were you, sir.

1991
02:50:26,749 --> 02:50:28,149
Sidney...

1992
02:50:28,349 --> 02:50:30,228
...I've got things to do.

1993
02:50:30,589 --> 02:50:34,869
I must get Cantor, Bill Rogers,
Bill Fields.

1994
02:50:35,069 --> 02:50:36,948
They must come back to me!

1995
02:50:37,269 --> 02:50:41,949
I'll have all my old stars
together in one great show.

1996
02:50:42,269 --> 02:50:46,229
I must do the biggest Follies
of my whole life!

1997
02:50:46,428 --> 02:50:48,109
I....

1998
02:50:59,708 --> 02:51:04,029
Oh, Sidney, I'm so terribly broke.

1999
02:51:04,189 --> 02:51:07,388
But Mr. Billings, sir,
isn't he going to help you?

2000
02:51:07,548 --> 02:51:09,629
Sidney, he hasn't a nickel.

2001
02:51:09,789 --> 02:51:13,588
He was lying to me just
to make me feel better.

2002
02:51:13,749 --> 02:51:15,068
We're both broke.

2003
02:51:15,228 --> 02:51:17,148
I wouldn't worry about that, sir.

2004
02:51:17,309 --> 02:51:19,708
You've been broke before, sir.

2005
02:51:19,868 --> 02:51:24,029
Yes, I know.
I've always laughed about it.

2006
02:51:25,628 --> 02:51:28,468
But I can't laugh anymore, Sidney...

2007
02:51:28,628 --> 02:51:31,029
...because I've been wrong.

2008
02:51:31,548 --> 02:51:33,588
I've got nothing.

2009
02:51:34,708 --> 02:51:36,828
Nothing to leave anyone.

2010
02:51:36,988 --> 02:51:39,188
Nothing, sir?
You leave them the memories...

2011
02:51:39,348 --> 02:51:41,948
...of the finest things ever done
on the stage, sir.

2012
02:51:42,108 --> 02:51:45,788
You'll leave them a name that they
can be proud of all their lives.

2013
02:51:45,948 --> 02:51:47,348
You'll soon feel better...

2014
02:51:47,508 --> 02:51:51,028
...and then you can do more beautiful
things than ever before, sir.

2015
02:51:51,188 --> 02:51:54,469
It's nice of you, Sidney, to say that.

2016
02:51:54,628 --> 02:51:57,748
I must call madam again now, sir.
It's after 10.

2017
02:52:07,347 --> 02:52:09,148
The memories...

2018
02:52:11,508 --> 02:52:16,308
...of the finest things ever done
on the stage.

2019
02:52:16,468 --> 02:52:18,867
Chicory 5161.

2020
02:52:22,228 --> 02:52:25,788
Hello? Get me Miss Burke's
dressing room, please.

2021
02:52:25,948 --> 02:52:27,388
Yes.

2022
02:52:29,147 --> 02:52:34,227
Oh, Miss Burke. He seems
to be resting comfortably.

2023
02:52:34,388 --> 02:52:37,107
Yes, I thought you'd like to know.

2024
02:52:37,268 --> 02:52:41,788
Yes, Miss Burke.
Yes, I'll deliver your message.

2025
02:52:50,267 --> 02:52:52,348
Mr. Ziegfeld.

2026
02:52:52,827 --> 02:52:54,588
Mr. Z--

2027
02:53:02,067 --> 02:53:05,427
Hello. Is Dr. Hassel
still in the building, please?

2028
02:53:05,587 --> 02:53:08,828
Would you ask him to come up
to Mr. Ziegfeld's apartment at once?

2029
02:53:08,988 --> 02:53:10,588
Yes. Hurry, please.

2030
02:53:43,707 --> 02:53:47,187
I've got to have more steps.

2031
02:53:48,827 --> 02:53:52,947
I need more steps.

2032
02:53:54,707 --> 02:53:57,107
I've got to get higher.

2033
02:53:59,547 --> 02:54:01,267
Higher.
