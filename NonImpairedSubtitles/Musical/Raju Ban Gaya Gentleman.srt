1
00:02:08,024 --> 00:02:11,050
Okay God, let's begin
again. I am Raj Mathur.

2
00:02:12,095 --> 00:02:14,655
Recognise me? I'm your Raju.

3
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:17,391
I thought you'd forgotten me.

4
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,669
I've brought this trident for you. Take.

5
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:23,401
Hurry up!
- Wonder when our turn will come.

6
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,075
What's going on here? Is
this a temple or a motel?

7
00:02:27,343 --> 00:02:29,709
Wonder who is inside.
He is not coming out.

8
00:02:30,146 --> 00:02:31,010
You understand?

9
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:33,376
Raju, what are you doing?

10
00:02:33,683 --> 00:02:35,651
Don't disturb us, we
are discussing something.

11
00:02:35,752 --> 00:02:37,652
Hurry up, there is a huge
crowd waiting outside.

12
00:02:37,754 --> 00:02:39,051
Alright, you go.

13
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:40,856
You haven't left?

14
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:42,658
Hurry up.

15
00:02:44,093 --> 00:02:47,392
God, your middleman troubles me a lot.

16
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:49,392
I forgot what I was saying.

17
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:52,668
God, you know what I want.

18
00:02:52,902 --> 00:02:55,666
I want to be a renowned engineer.

19
00:02:55,838 --> 00:03:00,002
So in my life there should be
big streets, big buildings...

20
00:03:00,143 --> 00:03:04,079
big houses... This
city is very small, God.

21
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:06,715
I cannot do anything here, God.

22
00:03:06,816 --> 00:03:08,716
My talent will be
wasted here, you know it.

23
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:11,446
I feel suffocated here.

24
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:14,723
Send me to Bombay somehow.

25
00:03:15,758 --> 00:03:19,125
God, if I reach Bombay,
my life will be made.

26
00:03:19,762 --> 00:03:25,132
Make me a rich man, God. Look, my
results are going to be declared

27
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:27,133
today Please let me score well.

28
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:29,737
Just a minute.

29
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:34,676
Please God...Bombay.

30
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:35,137
''My heart is crazy''

31
00:04:36,806 --> 00:04:39,741
''Friends, I am going''

32
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:54,183
''My destination is far, but go I must''

33
00:04:54,824 --> 00:04:58,191
''Good bye, friends!''

34
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,247
''My eyes hold dreams for the future''

35
00:05:55,885 --> 00:05:58,854
''My goals are very high''

36
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:03,256
''Don't stop me, friends''

37
00:06:04,894 --> 00:06:07,260
''My heart is not in my control''

38
00:06:08,898 --> 00:06:12,857
''My destination is
far, but go I must...''

39
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:26,372
''I have set out with a yearning''

40
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,638
''And a million desires in my heart''

41
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:35,315
''One day, the star of my luck''

42
00:07:36,352 --> 00:07:39,321
''Will surely shine''

43
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:44,656
''My destination is
far, but go I must...''

44
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:12,013
Hey hello! Do you know
where Ram Mohan lives?

45
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:15,778
I don't have time.
- No one seems to have time in

46
00:09:17,486 --> 00:09:19,044
Bombay. Do you know
where Ram Mohan lives?

47
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:23,790
Abdul, do you want to work or not?
- Of course sir.

48
00:09:24,093 --> 00:09:26,061
You just disappear.
Go serve tea to Pandey.

49
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:30,065
Pandey uncle, tea. Want anything else?

50
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,327
- No. Did you find a job?

51
00:09:32,435 --> 00:09:34,062
- Not yet. Let's see... Hello.

52
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,468
- Hello. Is this Azad Nagar?

53
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,506
- Yes. Who are you looking for?

54
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:40,574
- Do you know where Ram
Mohan lives? Who Ram Mohan?

55
00:09:40,743 --> 00:09:43,109
The one whose wife eloped
with the vegetable vendor.

56
00:09:43,212 --> 00:09:46,511
No, he's not even married. -
Shut-up! You are always raving.

57
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:50,846
He works in Raj Mills.
- Gulu Dada knows everyone.

58
00:09:51,153 --> 00:09:52,518
Take him to Gulu Dada's den.

59
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:00,128
Give me those hands, Thakur.

60
00:10:01,163 --> 00:10:04,860
What a dialogue it was, Amjadbhai.
I am a great fan of yours.

61
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:07,465
Boss, some men have come to meet you.

62
00:10:07,603 --> 00:10:10,538
How many men?
- Only five, Boss.

63
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:12,868
But in 'Sholay', they were just two.

64
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:15,905
Why am I afraid? I am not afraid.

65
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:23,914
Hey guys, leave. It’s 10 pm.
lf Sister comes, it will pour.

66
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,916
Boss, we have laid a bet.
Just let us play one game.

67
00:10:27,223 --> 00:10:30,852
Just one more strike.
- Just one strike and four men.

68
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,127
That's very unfair!

69
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:38,861
Gulu Dada, listen. This boy
has come from Darjeeling.

70
00:10:39,168 --> 00:10:42,137
He wants to meet some Ram
Mohan. Tell him where he lives.

71
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:45,866
Gulu Dada, no one can escape your eyes.

72
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,575
I know, but I cannot help him.
- But why, Dada?

73
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:52,909
I cannot, that's all.
- But why?

74
00:10:53,215 --> 00:10:58,517
He has left this colony. I
only got his house vacated.

75
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:01,181
Wonder if he is even dead or alive.

76
00:11:02,224 --> 00:11:03,191
What say, Tamba?

77
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,589
Gulu Dada, how many times have
I told you to shut shop at 10 pm?

78
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:13,802
It’s well past decent people's bed time.

79
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:15,931
Besides, even the school
exams are going on.

80
00:11:16,272 --> 00:11:20,834
Renu, what have you done? This poor
guy has come from Darjeeling only

81
00:11:21,277 --> 00:11:25,577
today He was asking for someone address.

82
00:11:25,681 --> 00:11:29,640
And you wet him. You didn't do
right. Come, on, leave all of you.

83
00:11:30,219 --> 00:11:34,178
And no Ram Mohan lives here.
I told you it will pour.

84
00:11:35,224 --> 00:11:36,191
Leave, come on. Let's go, Tamba.

85
00:11:51,273 --> 00:11:52,205
Wipe your head.

86
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,213
Hail Bholenath. You gave
me a good bath in Bombay...

87
00:12:37,286 --> 00:12:38,981
Got scared?
- Yes.

88
00:12:39,288 --> 00:12:41,654
Are you new here?
- Yes.

89
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:46,261
There is no place for
cowards in Bombay. Go back!

90
00:12:47,296 --> 00:12:50,265
lf you stay, you won't
realise when you got sucked.

91
00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:53,665
I have not come here to go back.

92
00:12:54,303 --> 00:12:56,271
I will make something
of myself and show you.

93
00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:59,264
What did you say?
- I am not leaving.

94
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:03,307
Come here.
- Let me take my bag.

95
00:13:03,746 --> 00:13:05,304
Jaibabu, your dinner.

96
00:13:05,414 --> 00:13:08,042
You?
- Jaibabu, he is new here.

97
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,318
The poor guy was orphaned as
soon as he stepped in Bombay.

98
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:17,318
This idol inside... People call it God.

99
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,721
I've heard he created the world.

100
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:24,332
And this creator was
orphaned in his own world.

101
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:26,732
You are no comparison.

102
00:13:31,674 --> 00:13:34,666
You met Sister?...Take this.

103
00:13:35,344 --> 00:13:38,279
It’s just a comb.
- Comb? I thought it was a knife.

104
00:13:38,414 --> 00:13:40,041
Come, let's eat.
- But...

105
00:13:40,349 --> 00:13:44,046
All these ifs and buts
are meaningless words.

106
00:13:45,354 --> 00:13:46,719
Have a place to stay?

107
00:13:48,357 --> 00:13:49,722
Alright, you can stay with me.

108
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,726
Do you know how to live in Bombay?
- How?

109
00:13:54,363 --> 00:13:56,331
Eat, itch, switch off the light.

110
00:13:56,432 --> 00:13:59,731
Open your eyes, and fool people.
Throw your cigarette and burn the

111
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:01,734
hut. I mean to say, come here.

112
00:14:02,404 --> 00:14:04,338
Kids, have money in your pocket?
- No.

113
00:14:04,473 --> 00:14:08,375
Then scram!...Hey alright, stay.

114
00:14:09,411 --> 00:14:13,370
I won't wish 'namaskar' to
Hindus, 'salaam' to Muslims...

115
00:14:13,482 --> 00:14:15,109
or 'good morning' to Christians.

116
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:17,385
Because I have not come here
to create communal problems.

117
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:19,386
Am I right?
- Yes.

118
00:14:19,822 --> 00:14:24,384
You must be thinking I will woo
you with my talks and sell you kohl.

119
00:14:24,493 --> 00:14:29,396
No, that's not my job,
the doctors do that.

120
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:35,065
Then you will assume I am
going to sell you tooth powder.

121
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:38,066
I don't consider you to be such fools.

122
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:41,774
What will you do with
strong teeth anyway?

123
00:14:44,413 --> 00:14:47,780
No brothers, I won't even
foretell your destiny.

124
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:52,717
Because a street performer,
and his audience, both have bad

125
00:14:56,425 --> 00:15:02,386
destinies. You must be
wondering what I am going

126
00:15:03,432 --> 00:15:09,132
to sell that you don't get in
Bombay. Look friends, in this magical

127
00:15:09,471 --> 00:15:11,837
city, from fritters to chicken...
and from the most petty to the most

128
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:14,840
expensive, everything is available.
You only need money to buy it.

129
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:19,104
And that's what you don't
have. All of you are broke.

130
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:22,450
Every man standing here desires
to move around in a car...

131
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:26,453
and dance with a babe
in a five star hotel.

132
00:15:29,892 --> 00:15:32,383
But your pocket is empty.

133
00:15:32,494 --> 00:15:35,725
I'll tell you how to
make money. Want to know?

134
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:39,790
Yes!
- See! Everyone wants to know.

135
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:43,132
Everyone wants to grow,
everyone wants to be rich.

136
00:15:43,472 --> 00:15:47,135
But this is Bombay, you don't
get anything for free here.

137
00:15:47,476 --> 00:15:50,775
Everything costs money. You won't
get my advice for free either.

138
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,440
Come on, everyone pay Rs. 1

139
00:15:55,884 --> 00:15:58,785
You'll first have to learn to look up.

140
00:15:58,887 --> 00:16:00,855
Here, only the one
who looks up survives.

141
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,185
Those who...you looked down again!

142
00:16:03,492 --> 00:16:05,460
Those who look down have
no right to live in Bombay.

143
00:16:05,561 --> 00:16:08,462
Only the one who makes his goal
his stepping stone can rise here.

144
00:16:08,564 --> 00:16:11,863
And never give a thought to
who he crushed under his feet.

145
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:14,469
There is no place for
those who look back.

146
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,505
Just push and make way for yourself.

147
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,464
This is the first lesson... come.

148
00:16:25,047 --> 00:16:27,413
Hello Pandey uncle.
- Bless you.

149
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,348
Come Jaibabu. Took him around Bombay?

150
00:16:31,387 --> 00:16:32,354
Have tea and come home.

151
00:16:34,991 --> 00:16:37,960
Rafiqbhai, I'm very tired.
- Abdul, special tea for Raju.

152
00:16:38,394 --> 00:16:42,956
Why are you beating me?
- You steal cake from the bakery!

153
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:45,363
No, I just had bread.

154
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:48,297
Shut-up! Rafiqbhai, you
are always defending him.

155
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:50,962
He steals cake everyday from my bakery.

156
00:16:51,107 --> 00:16:54,338
His wage is Rs.10 a day, and he
eats cake worth Rs.15 every day.

157
00:16:54,443 --> 00:16:56,377
Then give me a raise.
- I'll give you a tight slap!

158
00:16:57,446 --> 00:17:00,006
Raise indeed! Go and work.

159
00:17:00,116 --> 00:17:03,017
Serve me a hot cup of tea.
- Now stop being angry.

160
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:04,086
Abdul, give him tea.

161
00:17:07,056 --> 00:17:09,422
One cutting.
- Give him half a cup.

162
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,028
Take.
- Here's the money, Rafiqbhai.

163
00:17:13,129 --> 00:17:17,031
Great! Joseph look,
he is giving me money.

164
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:22,028
Don't bother. Pay me
when you start earning.

165
00:17:22,505 --> 00:17:24,029
Abdul, serve mince meat and bread there.

166
00:17:24,507 --> 00:17:27,032
Hello Rafiqbhai.
- Hello Sister. Come.

167
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,710
How are you?
- I'm fine, Joseph uncle.

168
00:17:30,046 --> 00:17:33,015
What do you want?
- Four eggs and a loaf of bread.

169
00:17:33,115 --> 00:17:34,412
Get four eggs.

170
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:41,012
Rafiqbhai, if Raju wants,
he can work in my bakery.

171
00:17:41,123 --> 00:17:44,024
He'll get paid too.
- Good idea.

172
00:17:44,126 --> 00:17:47,357
Raju, work in his bakery for now. You
will at least make some money to live

173
00:17:47,463 --> 00:17:52,366
by No Rafiqbhai, I don't want to ruin my

174
00:17:52,468 --> 00:17:56,427
lf I do odd jobs, I'll
always remain menial.

175
00:17:58,107 --> 00:18:01,406
So you think every man who
does odd jobs is menial?

176
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:05,471
I didn't say that.
- No, you didn't.

177
00:18:05,715 --> 00:18:09,082
But that's what you meant.
- No, you are mistaken.

178
00:18:09,185 --> 00:18:12,416
What I meant is doing small
jobs, one begins to think small.

179
00:18:12,521 --> 00:18:14,079
Even his ambition in life becomes small.

180
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,817
Even your desires become small.

181
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,821
Do you know there are many
people in the world...

182
00:18:19,128 --> 00:18:21,426
who do ordinary jobs and are yet happy?

183
00:18:22,131 --> 00:18:24,497
Then who are you to decide
who is big and who is small?

184
00:18:25,134 --> 00:18:28,433
Rafiqbhai, I was talking to you. I
didn't ask her to budge in between.

185
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:31,802
Your statement was such that...
- Look, I don't want to argue with you.

186
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:35,043
I will one day show you who I am

187
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:36,143
and what I have come here to be. - Eggs.

188
00:18:38,514 --> 00:18:39,446
She is strange.

189
00:18:39,615 --> 00:18:41,583
lf she is up, she throws water,
and if she's down, she fights.

190
00:18:42,118 --> 00:18:43,380
Does she have a problem?

191
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,098
We have no vacancy to
offer you right now.

192
00:19:08,577 --> 00:19:11,137
You won't get a job like that.

193
00:19:12,181 --> 00:19:17,483
Dreaming of a good job, you
studied from childhood to youth.

194
00:19:17,586 --> 00:19:20,555
Got reprimanded by teachers,
kept writing reams of papers.

195
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,649
And what did you learn? Monday comes
after Sunday. You get 4 eggs for

196
00:19:26,195 --> 00:19:28,561
Rs.1 . You took the beating,

197
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:36,562
but someone else is
ruling. What did you learn?

198
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:38,171
1x2 makes 4, 4x2 makes
1? What did you learn?

199
00:19:52,254 --> 00:19:54,222
How will you get a job like that?

200
00:19:54,323 --> 00:19:57,952
Only if you watch the world
standing on your head will you see it

201
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,626
straight. lf you don't
keep weight(bribe) on

202
00:20:01,263 --> 00:20:04,630
your application, it will be
lost. And weights are of different

203
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:07,235
colours, different types.
The weight of black money,

204
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:09,236
the weight of a beautiful
body. The weight of bullies.

205
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:27,016
You won't get a job like that.

206
00:20:27,323 --> 00:20:30,622
What is very dear, what
can be lost very easily.

207
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,627
Look through the torn sole of your
shoe, and you'll see the truth.

208
00:20:35,264 --> 00:20:37,630
Your shoe will seem
big, and the world small.

209
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:41,630
Your destiny will fall apart.

210
00:20:43,305 --> 00:20:46,240
Did the shoe have to tear today?
I have to go for an interview.

211
00:20:49,311 --> 00:20:51,677
What happened? Why are
you walking like that?

212
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:55,008
Have you sprained your leg?
- No Pandey uncle.

213
00:20:55,317 --> 00:20:57,615
My shoe sole tore.
- Your shoe tore?

214
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,818
You are laughing? It’s a
question of saving my grace.

215
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:01,680
I have to go for an interview today.

216
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:05,488
You will surely get the
job, my heart says so.

217
00:21:16,505 --> 00:21:19,440
Where are you going?
- To get vegetables.

218
00:21:19,575 --> 00:21:21,475
But you have sprained
your foot. I'll get them.

219
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:25,138
It’s not too bad. I'll be
back soon, you take rest.

220
00:21:25,581 --> 00:21:27,549
Must you do everything yourself?

221
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:32,821
You are going for an interview,
and look at your gait. Great!

222
00:21:33,122 --> 00:21:36,091
What a gait! Keep limping.

223
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:43,496
lf they ask who I am,
I'll say, I am a cripple.

224
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:46,101
Cripple. Keep limping like cripples.

225
00:21:49,171 --> 00:21:50,536
What kind of a joke is this?

226
00:21:51,173 --> 00:21:53,107
You could not argue, so you
have stooped to this now?

227
00:21:53,242 --> 00:21:54,470
What do you mean?

228
00:21:54,577 --> 00:21:57,478
You should feel ashamed
to misbehave like that.

229
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,138
How did I misbehave with you?

230
00:21:59,248 --> 00:22:02,877
imitating girls in the street,
teasing them, is a very decent act?

231
00:22:03,185 --> 00:22:05,153
Look, don't spoil my mood early
morning. You go if you like.

232
00:22:05,254 --> 00:22:08,155
Why should I go? You go.
- You want to go, you go.

233
00:22:08,257 --> 00:22:11,556
Strange man you are. You are
asking me to go, why don't you go?

234
00:22:12,194 --> 00:22:14,560
Alright, I only will go.
You are always fighting.

235
00:22:16,198 --> 00:22:19,565
You are teasing me again? Rogue, loafer!

236
00:22:19,702 --> 00:22:21,897
Why are you calling me names?

237
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:24,502
I'm helpless, that's why I
am tolerating your nonsense.

238
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,576
Look, my shoe is torn.
Are you satisfied now?

239
00:22:29,245 --> 00:22:31,543
As it is, I am upset, moreover,
you are calling me names.

240
00:22:32,181 --> 00:22:37,551
I am not a loafer, I am an engineer.
Those people who make homes...

241
00:22:45,194 --> 00:22:48,163
Please mend this.
- It will cost you Rs.20.

242
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,567
I have only this much money.
Please make do with it.

243
00:22:55,204 --> 00:22:57,172
Actually, I have to attend an interview.

244
00:22:57,306 --> 00:22:59,206
lf I don't reach in
time, I'll have a problem.

245
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:01,606
No sir, I won't take
anything less than Rs.20.

246
00:23:03,245 --> 00:23:04,177
Take.

247
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:12,618
Dagdu, take this, and hurry.
- Dagdu, return her money.

248
00:23:13,255 --> 00:23:14,222
I don't want your money.

249
00:23:15,591 --> 00:23:18,560
I'm sorry I made a mistake.
- I don't want anyone's favour...

250
00:23:18,661 --> 00:23:21,630
I am giving it to you as a
loan, not doing you any favour.

251
00:23:22,264 --> 00:23:24,630
Return it to me when you get a job.

252
00:23:25,267 --> 00:23:26,234
Okay?

253
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:34,539
We cannot give you any job in this firm.

254
00:23:34,643 --> 00:23:36,167
I wanted this job...

255
00:23:42,585 --> 00:23:45,281
But sir, I badly need
this job. You can...

256
00:24:03,305 --> 00:24:05,603
Father, I'll just be back.
- What is the matter?

257
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,232
I'll just be back.

258
00:24:23,325 --> 00:24:26,021
Look God, whatever you
are doing is not right.

259
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:29,627
Have you sent me from Darjeeling to
Bombay to run from pillar to post?

260
00:24:29,932 --> 00:24:34,232
Look, my pocket is empty, my time
bad, and even my shoe tore today.

261
00:24:34,336 --> 00:24:35,303
Go and see outside.

262
00:24:35,471 --> 00:24:38,634
I had to take a loan
from a girl...a girl!

263
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:41,674
I truly feel like crying now.

264
00:24:43,312 --> 00:24:45,246
But I am a man, I cannot even cry.

265
00:24:46,315 --> 00:24:50,684
Enough now God, I cannot
tolerate it anymore.

266
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,287
Do something for me.

267
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:02,625
You?
- I'd come to ask...

268
00:25:02,731 --> 00:25:05,700
Look don't worry,
I'll return your Rs.20.

269
00:25:06,335 --> 00:25:09,702
I'm not asking for money What
happened at the interview?

270
00:25:09,972 --> 00:25:14,909
What will happen? Even they felt
I am not suitable for their firm.

271
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:21,679
So what have you thought of doing?
- What is left to think now?

272
00:25:25,387 --> 00:25:30,290
Look Renu, I'm very sorry. In
my zeal, I was talking big that

273
00:25:31,327 --> 00:25:34,296
day. But now I
understand you were right.

274
00:25:35,331 --> 00:25:37,697
What is the harm in
taking up a small job?

275
00:25:38,334 --> 00:25:40,029
Good you changed your mind.

276
00:25:41,337 --> 00:25:45,296
Father is home. Meet him,
maybe he can help you.

277
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:48,740
No...
- Come on!

278
00:25:53,382 --> 00:25:58,342
I have written a letter for Mr.
Kavas. I hope he can help you.

279
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:03,756
You have taken the right decision.
Until you don't get a job...

280
00:26:03,893 --> 00:26:05,758
as per your qualification,
take up this job.

281
00:26:06,395 --> 00:26:09,762
Come on, it's time for the library
to close down. Can't you hear the

282
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:11,764
bell? Close the books. It’s 5:30.

283
00:26:14,403 --> 00:26:17,804
Come at 10 am tomorrow.
Come on, pack up everyday.

284
00:26:19,842 --> 00:26:24,779
Geeta, pack up. Why don't
you eat? You are so skinny.

285
00:26:25,848 --> 00:26:26,815
Come tomorrow.

286
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,749
Didn't you hear the bell?
- Let me finish the last list.

287
00:26:32,388 --> 00:26:36,757
No, I have never done overtime,
nor let anyone else work overtime.

288
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:40,362
You must come at 10 am,
and leave at 5:30 pm.

289
00:26:40,462 --> 00:26:44,364
You close at 5:30 everyday?
- Sharp 5:30!

290
00:26:44,466 --> 00:26:48,766
That's great.
- You've learnt my language.

291
00:27:04,853 --> 00:27:06,411
Geeta, don't forget that file.

292
00:27:24,506 --> 00:27:28,169
I had not come to meet you. I am
working in the library these days...

293
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,808
so I had come to deliver some
books here to a shopkeeper.

294
00:27:31,447 --> 00:27:34,746
But his shop was closed.
Then I noticed this building.

295
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:39,810
And I realized it was your
building, so I came to peep in.

296
00:27:41,457 --> 00:27:42,822
You came to deliver
books to a shopkeeper?

297
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:45,426
Yes, at the corner here.
- So where are the books?

298
00:27:49,865 --> 00:27:53,426
I'm caught.
- Yes, you are.

299
00:27:55,471 --> 00:27:57,439
Actually, I wanted to meet you.

300
00:27:58,707 --> 00:28:01,471
Actually, even I wanted
that you come and meet me.

301
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:02,842
Really?

302
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:06,113
Shall we go?
- Yes.

303
00:28:24,935 --> 00:28:27,233
Abdul, serve two halves to Pandit.
- Yes, two special...

304
00:28:28,105 --> 00:28:30,039
Keep one on my table.

305
00:28:31,108 --> 00:28:32,040
Give me a pack of biscuits.

306
00:28:34,111 --> 00:28:37,046
Hey! Do you see what I see?

307
00:28:41,118 --> 00:28:42,813
What are you doing?
- What happened?

308
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,087
Both are coming together?

309
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:48,587
An air plane in water
and a ship in the air?

310
00:28:51,228 --> 00:28:54,197
5:45.
- Let me see... 5:45.

311
00:28:55,232 --> 00:28:56,199
Leave her hand.

312
00:29:02,672 --> 00:29:05,197
Jai, you deliberately rode between them.

313
00:29:08,612 --> 00:29:09,544
Hey, no messing.

314
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:12,646
Look there.

315
00:29:14,284 --> 00:29:15,649
We'll have to go now.

316
00:29:17,287 --> 00:29:20,654
They were at war until yesterday,
today they are at peace.

317
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:24,590
Be at it!
- Why are you behaving like that?

318
00:29:24,694 --> 00:29:26,252
Have you never seen a girl before?

319
00:29:26,363 --> 00:29:28,661
Bye.
- Bye...just a minute.

320
00:29:33,303 --> 00:29:34,270
Going?

321
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:41,275
He's coming here.

322
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:01,661
Guys, now the girl's door will open
& she will come out on the pretext

323
00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:03,733
... of drying an already dry towel.

324
00:30:03,867 --> 00:30:06,335
'Dil diya dard liya' running in Roxy

325
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:20,383
She did it!

326
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:24,717
Now?
- The hero will act stylish.

327
00:30:24,821 --> 00:30:27,790
Then he will slyly make
a gesture at his beloved.

328
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:31,327
He will make a gesture now.

329
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:42,336
Now?

330
00:30:42,472 --> 00:30:44,372
The girl will coyly drum
her fingers on the parapet.

331
00:30:47,811 --> 00:30:49,335
The girl will now drum her fingers.

332
00:30:56,086 --> 00:30:59,385
She did!... Now?

333
00:30:59,489 --> 00:31:04,119
Caring a damn about the world, she
will throw a flying kiss at the boy.

334
00:31:04,427 --> 00:31:06,395
And he will catch it like Azharuddin.

335
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:09,796
The girl will throw a kiss.

336
00:31:20,477 --> 00:31:21,409
He caught it.

337
00:31:28,818 --> 00:31:31,378
Jai, you are a champion.
Where did you learn it?

338
00:31:31,488 --> 00:31:32,455
Experience!

339
00:31:33,423 --> 00:31:35,391
Even you were in love?
- Very deeply.

340
00:31:35,492 --> 00:31:37,119
What was the name of the girl?
- Madhumati.

341
00:31:37,427 --> 00:31:39,793
But you said Bandhini the other day.
- She came later.

342
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,125
The first one was Madhumati.
I was deeply in love with her.

343
00:31:42,432 --> 00:31:44,798
Why didn't you marry her?
- I forgot.

344
00:31:46,436 --> 00:31:47,403
The girl's father has come.

345
00:31:49,873 --> 00:31:50,805
He's come!

346
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:02,451
What will happen now?

347
00:32:02,552 --> 00:32:04,850
Nothing, he'll water
the plant and leave.

348
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:13,462
He's gone.

349
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:24,905
Listen to this... 'That light pole'

350
00:32:25,942 --> 00:32:27,466
'Those leaves'

351
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:32,846
The heart will meet the heart.

352
00:38:12,221 --> 00:38:14,189
Bye.
- Bye.

353
00:38:14,824 --> 00:38:19,193
Manoj, give madam grams. I don't
have change. Madam, pay him.

354
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:23,196
Manoj, I have notes!
- He's become a rich man.

355
00:38:26,136 --> 00:38:27,103
Take.

356
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:29,434
Renu, we sit and eat
grams here everyday.

357
00:38:29,606 --> 00:38:33,474
Let's go somewhere,
freak around, eat Chinese.

358
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:37,478
And blow away the whole
month’s salary in a day.

359
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,413
And then ask for loans.
- Yes. You will give me?

360
00:38:40,517 --> 00:38:42,417
Not at all. We are not going anywhere.

361
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:45,079
Such good breeze is
blowing here. Stay here.

362
00:38:45,188 --> 00:38:47,088
Stay here indeed! We sit here everyday.

363
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:50,819
Look how much money I
have. 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

364
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:53,096
I'll keep the money.
- No, I want to spend it all.

365
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,100
Alright, keep one.

366
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:01,104
Keep one more.

367
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:03,832
Enough! We'll spend
the rest of the money.

368
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:05,106
But why?
- Don't argue.

369
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:06,539
We'll treat ourselves to Chinese.

370
00:39:08,378 --> 00:39:09,310
No, there is no need.

371
00:39:56,259 --> 00:39:58,625
We are very tired walking.
Let's buy a small car.

372
00:39:58,762 --> 00:40:00,957
You started it again? Let's go home.

373
00:40:01,264 --> 00:40:03,232
No, we won't go home. lf
we do, we'll go by car.

374
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,563
Are you crazy? Have
you seen your pocket?

375
00:40:06,703 --> 00:40:08,967
I have very little
money, but huge desires.

376
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,241
Desires cannot buy you a car.
- Everything is possible with

377
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:14,605
desires. Come on! For some time.

378
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:18,272
- No! Don't stop me today. Come on.

379
00:40:18,381 --> 00:40:20,611
- But why go inside?
I want to buy a car.

380
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,278
Why don't you understand?
We want to buy a car.

381
00:40:26,723 --> 00:40:28,623
- Car?...you want to buy a car? Yes.

382
00:40:29,259 --> 00:40:31,227
- Both of you? Yes, both of us.

383
00:40:32,262 --> 00:40:35,959
- Want to buy a car? lf you don't mind,

384
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:40,225
I want to ask you something. Go ahead.

385
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:45,004
- Buying a car for the first
time? Isn’t it? Even I am selling

386
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:50,006
a car for the first time. Oh great!

387
00:40:51,314 --> 00:40:54,681
- It’s my first day in
the show room. Please come.

388
00:41:03,326 --> 00:41:06,295
- I'll have a look at the cars.
Look, we don't want to buy any car.

389
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,391
Raju, let's go. Wait!

390
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,830
Look at his face. The poor
man will be heart broken.

391
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,605
It’s his first day to work.
Sir, don't worry. Tell me

392
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:22,212
about the car features. Features?

393
00:41:22,345 --> 00:41:24,279
There are so many. Come.

394
00:41:26,683 --> 00:41:30,517
- No, I don't... Look
at its body, its colour,

395
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,178
its size, the model,
its wipers! Look inside.

396
00:41:36,226 --> 00:41:40,185
It has everything. Take a look inside.

397
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:41,696
I saw it all. Shall we go now?

398
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:47,602
Can we sit inside?
- Of course! Come.

399
00:41:48,271 --> 00:41:50,205
Not you...madam.

400
00:41:51,274 --> 00:41:54,209
Me?
- Please come.

401
00:41:55,278 --> 00:41:57,644
Renu, get in.

402
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:02,581
I'll go and sit on the
other side. Renu, I'm coming.

403
00:42:04,287 --> 00:42:06,653
Madam, we'll go for a long drive.

404
00:42:13,296 --> 00:42:16,265
Excuse me, we'll wind up the
glasses to see how it feels.

405
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:26,675
Renu, those who have such cars
must be having so much fun.

406
00:42:31,281 --> 00:42:32,646
Raju, he is standing
outside, sit properly.

407
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:34,648
He can't see a thing, I
have wound up the glass.

408
00:42:35,285 --> 00:42:38,652
But he is looking here.
- You look at me, don't look there.

409
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,261
You look so beautiful. Give me a kiss.

410
00:42:47,697 --> 00:42:50,666
Are you in your senses?
- No, not at all.

411
00:42:51,301 --> 00:42:53,269
Where does one get
such a chance in Bombay?

412
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,001
Raju please!
- He cannot see anything.

413
00:43:01,344 --> 00:43:02,276
You have become very brazen.

414
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:08,647
Sorry...you took very long, so...

415
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,720
Renu, what happened?

416
00:43:11,354 --> 00:43:15,051
We like the car, but
madam is in a bad mood.

417
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:17,656
Look, it's enough now, let's go.
- See! I told you she's off mood.

418
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,730
You convince her.
- Madam, please don't be in a bad

419
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:28,269
mood. Actually, you are right.

420
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:32,706
What a lovely car this
is. And look at this car.

421
00:43:33,343 --> 00:43:36,278
It’s such a lovely colour.
Darling, shall we buy both the cars?

422
00:43:36,746 --> 00:43:37,678
- Both? Yes, both.

423
00:43:38,748 --> 00:43:41,308
We'll take both the cars.

424
00:43:42,352 --> 00:43:44,718
But what will we do with two cars?

425
00:43:45,355 --> 00:43:48,654
I'll take one for shopping,...

426
00:43:48,758 --> 00:43:51,318
and you use the other to drop
Bablu and Pappu to school.

427
00:43:54,364 --> 00:43:56,730
Our kids, Bablu and Pappu.

428
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:03,669
Nice names. Sir look, madam
has been convinced now.

429
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:08,744
I'll go and make the bill.
- Just a minute...What is your name?

430
00:44:09,012 --> 00:44:13,381
My name? Lovechand Kukreja.
- Mr. Kukreja, there's a problem.

431
00:44:13,483 --> 00:44:17,385
No problem sir, I'll help
you. What's the problem?

432
00:44:18,421 --> 00:44:19,786
We don't have money.

433
00:44:21,424 --> 00:44:24,723
You don't have money? And
you had come to buy two cars?

434
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:25,795
Madam wanted...

435
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,728
Let's go, Renu.

436
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,337
Wait.

437
00:44:39,409 --> 00:44:42,344
Lovechand, I will
surely come back one day.

438
00:44:44,414 --> 00:44:46,382
And buy a car for her.

439
00:44:47,617 --> 00:44:48,584
That's a promise.

440
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:53,723
Come.

441
00:45:15,478 --> 00:45:19,437
Hey!
- Sorry! They were rejection letters.

442
00:45:19,549 --> 00:45:22,848
Didn't get a job?
- Where do you get jobs in your city?

443
00:45:23,486 --> 00:45:25,454
You'll get one.
- Oh yeah?

444
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:28,389
Sorry...you...

445
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,412
How are you?

446
00:45:52,882 --> 00:45:54,850
Sorry, I got late.

447
00:45:55,885 --> 00:45:57,853
But I have brought a surprise
for you in this envelope.

448
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:02,458
Want to have grams? Take, eat.

449
00:46:03,493 --> 00:46:07,452
Why are you sitting sullen?
- Then should I laugh like you?

450
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,464
Why not?
- Stop laughing!

451
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,065
Your city is horrible!

452
00:46:12,902 --> 00:46:15,837
It’s got a population of 10 million,
but a man cannot get a job here!

453
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,840
Look, don't blame Bombay.
What has the city done to you?

454
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,877
Damn your Bombay! Damn it!!

455
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:30,442
Hey! Who is it? Can't you see?

456
00:46:30,553 --> 00:46:33,852
I'm sorry.
- Are you hurt?

457
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:36,459
Continue.

458
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:38,789
You'll hurt someone.
- What do I do?

459
00:46:38,895 --> 00:46:41,864
They are popping out of
everywhere. Even earlier...

460
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,867
I know now. I can't do
anything in this city.

461
00:46:47,537 --> 00:46:48,469
Bombay!

462
00:46:49,539 --> 00:46:52,474
I am destined to work
in that damned library.

463
00:46:54,544 --> 00:46:57,479
Poor Raju! Have grams.

464
00:47:03,953 --> 00:47:06,513
But this envelope contains
a bumper lottery,...

465
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,523
opening which, your destiny will shine.

466
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:11,527
You will have a car,
bungalow, money, everything.

467
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:14,927
Have a look.
- No, I am not that lucky.

468
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:18,262
Raju! That was your interview call.
- My interview call?

469
00:47:18,568 --> 00:47:20,536
That too, from our company.
- Chhabria Constructions?

470
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,934
And you tore it.
- Why did you give it to me?

471
00:47:23,606 --> 00:47:24,971
Pick it up!

472
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:30,503
It’s my interview call! Do
your romance later, help me.

473
00:47:31,948 --> 00:47:33,506
You leave, please.

474
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:40,921
You didn't tell me...

475
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:48,929
Take.
- What now?

476
00:47:49,065 --> 00:47:51,533
What? We'll stick it, what else?

477
00:47:51,634 --> 00:47:54,262
The annual report is
lying at home, read it.

478
00:47:59,609 --> 00:48:01,975
I'm Rishi Vaswani, I've
come for an interview.

479
00:48:05,615 --> 00:48:07,583
Please sit there.

480
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:23,599
Yes.
- You may go in.

481
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:33,974
The Howrah Bridge suspension.

482
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,591
Mr. Mathur, you have just done
a diploma in civil engineering.

483
00:48:48,691 --> 00:48:50,591
Whereas, even degree holders
have applied for the job.

484
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,995
I don't understand.

485
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:57,600
He means to ask why
we should appoint you.

486
00:49:01,671 --> 00:49:05,607
Because a degree only gives
you a certificate, not brains.

487
00:49:07,677 --> 00:49:10,612
Which you have?
- Yes.

488
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:16,381
Can you prove it?
- Of course.

489
00:49:16,686 --> 00:49:17,653
How?

490
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:21,383
Take Shakti Nagar, your
construction in Delhi.

491
00:49:21,691 --> 00:49:23,989
You take great pride in it.
- Why won't we?

492
00:49:24,093 --> 00:49:27,062
It is one of the posh and
best complexes in Delhi.

493
00:49:27,697 --> 00:49:32,066
That's very true, and you put in
about 300 million rupees in it.

494
00:49:35,738 --> 00:49:38,104
The RCC component would
be 150 million rupees?

495
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:40,675
That accounts to so
much wastage of money.

496
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:53,720
Yes, and if you used load
bearing bricks walls...

497
00:49:53,823 --> 00:49:56,724
your budget would be 35 %.

498
00:50:01,764 --> 00:50:04,460
The other expenses including labor
would come to 25 million rupees.

499
00:50:04,767 --> 00:50:09,067
Where you have spent 150 million,
you would only spend 100 million.

500
00:50:09,205 --> 00:50:14,142
Call this a saving of 50 million,
or a profit of 50 million.

501
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:19,179
What does your computer say?

502
00:50:36,766 --> 00:50:40,133
Modi, who made this complex?
- Sir, not me....

503
00:50:41,804 --> 00:50:44,170
So you made this complex?

504
00:50:45,808 --> 00:50:48,174
That means...
- That means I must get this job.

505
00:50:52,815 --> 00:50:55,181
Meet me later, Mr. Saxena.

506
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:18,807
''Our colony is celebrating today''

507
00:51:19,475 --> 00:51:23,844
''Everyone is lost in gaiety.

508
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:37,189
''Our Raju is a hero,
and we are Raju's fans''

509
00:51:37,827 --> 00:51:39,795
''Raju has become a gentleman!''

510
00:52:30,279 --> 00:52:34,238
''Even my stars have shined''

511
00:52:34,884 --> 00:52:39,253
''Water has gushed out of a stone''

512
00:52:41,891 --> 00:52:46,260
''Lost in my own world''

513
00:52:46,896 --> 00:52:51,265
''I hide what's in my heart''

514
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:53,596
''My heart is now at peace''

515
00:52:53,903 --> 00:52:55,268
''It used to be so restless''

516
00:52:55,938 --> 00:52:59,874
''Raju has become a gentleman!''

517
00:53:23,966 --> 00:53:28,266
''You will have the world
at your feet one day''

518
00:53:28,938 --> 00:53:33,307
''You will be very successful one day''

519
00:53:47,957 --> 00:53:52,326
''God will continually
shower his mercy on you now''

520
00:53:52,962 --> 00:53:56,921
''Raju has become a gentleman!''

521
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:11,946
''Despite your presence, it is
money that rules your world''

522
00:54:12,081 --> 00:54:16,381
''Money is the God of the world,
what kind of a God are you?''

523
00:54:17,019 --> 00:54:21,388
''It is now I realise
even you are like me''

524
00:54:22,024 --> 00:54:25,983
''Money...money...money...''

525
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:49,712
''Running after money, the world
has forgotten everything else''

526
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:53,978
''Raju has become a gentleman!''

527
00:55:14,076 --> 00:55:18,445
''Sing and play the band''

528
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:27,980
''I am crazy about you, you are my love''

529
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:36,988
''You have done a great
job, you are Superman''

530
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,447
Gentlemen, this is project Dreamland.

531
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:58,181
In America, with the help
of a senior architect...

532
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:01,457
I designed it keeping
the Indian middle class in mind.

533
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:06,453
There will be 12 multi
storied buildings in it.

534
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:20,837
And even a swimming pool.

535
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:28,847
What do you all have to say?

536
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:41,191
I think, this will be the first
project of its kind in India.

537
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:44,467
Why not also have a disco?

538
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:50,462
In fact, I even want a gym, where
there will also be tennis courts.

539
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:54,842
That will help in selling
our project easily...

540
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:08,923
You want to say something?
- I... no.

541
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:14,530
I'm Raj Mathur.

542
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:17,532
He's Raj Mathur, assistant
engineer, he has joined recently.

543
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:24,973
lf you want to say something, say
it. lf you want to laugh, go outside.

544
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:29,237
It’s nothing like that.
- Then what it is?

545
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:33,507
I was just saying...
- Stand up and talk.

546
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:38,919
The project you are talking
about is for the common man?

547
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:41,524
Yes, why?

548
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,518
Then this swimming pool,
jogging park, gymnasium...?

549
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,929
I don't know which world you live in.

550
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:48,531
Shall I sit?

551
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:52,933
Why, what's wrong in it?
What are you trying to say?

552
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,538
Sir, I want to say... what is it?

553
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:01,306
I want to say that those
whose life itself is a jog...

554
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:04,307
whose children play hockey
with a broken stick...

555
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:06,582
Madam, hockey is our national game.

556
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:08,310
and kick a burst ball...

557
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:10,313
for them, even thinking of
a swimming pool, gymnasium...

558
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:13,589
and like sir said, a
disco, is a cruel joke.

559
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:17,990
Madam, these middle income people...

560
00:58:18,128 --> 00:58:21,586
don't want status, they want facilities.

561
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:25,328
Don't give them a gym,
give them a school.

562
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:27,535
Give them a bus stop, a hospital.

563
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:30,534
Give them clean drinking
water, like this.

564
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:37,546
lf you give them all
this, they will bless you.

565
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,412
And if you don't give them all this,
your Dreamland project will be a

566
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,318
ruin. Because the rich won't

567
00:58:45,422 --> 00:58:46,980
go so far for a flat. And
the middle income class

568
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,990
won't be able to afford it. Am I right?

569
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:50,992
- Yes... I mean... no. And
if it's no, what's the

570
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:53,797
sense in making this
building? Believe me, madam.

571
00:59:05,576 --> 00:59:07,510
Who are you to advice us?

572
00:59:08,979 --> 00:59:11,948
Mr. Saxena, teach him how
to speak in a board room.

573
00:59:17,588 --> 00:59:19,954
Saxena, understood what Malhotra said?

574
00:59:20,091 --> 00:59:22,559
- Yes sir. Then hurry up.

575
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,958
Sir...
- You are acting over intelligent.

576
00:59:25,596 --> 00:59:26,563
You spoilt...
- But you said it was alright.

577
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:38,075
But sir, tell me, what is my fault?

578
00:59:38,544 --> 00:59:42,105
Fault? Call it carelessness.

579
00:59:43,148 --> 00:59:44,706
You challenged the management.

580
00:59:46,151 --> 00:59:48,119
The company from which
you want your salary...

581
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:51,451
Sapna madam is the only daughter
of it's owner, Mr. Chhabria.

582
00:59:51,557 --> 00:59:53,115
What?
- Yes!

583
00:59:53,225 --> 00:59:56,854
Sir, do you have a revolver,
a knife, a dagger, a blade?

584
00:59:57,162 --> 00:59:59,130
Blade? You think I am a pick pocket?

585
01:00:01,166 --> 01:00:04,135
Sir, listen to me. I was dumb.

586
01:00:04,236 --> 01:00:05,863
I've got this job with great difficulty.

587
01:00:06,205 --> 01:00:07,570
And you'll lose it with equal ease.

588
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:10,573
Do you know what he did
at the board meeting?

589
01:00:10,876 --> 01:00:14,175
He wants a bus stop for the poor
people, a school, a hospital.

590
01:00:14,279 --> 01:00:18,181
He doesn't want a jogger's park, he
doesn't want a swimming pool, a gym.

591
01:00:18,283 --> 01:00:20,581
Then what does he want? He
said all this in the board

592
01:00:20,819 --> 01:00:23,913
meeting. And do you know to whom?

593
01:00:24,223 --> 01:00:25,121
- Whom? Sapna madam.

594
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:31,125
Renu, you typed his
appointment letter a week ago.

595
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:34,529
Now type is dismissal
letter. He's lost his job.

596
01:00:36,168 --> 01:00:40,127
What will happen now? Mr. Saxena
should have told me she is...

597
01:00:40,272 --> 01:00:43,173
What happened, Raj?
- I am ill-fated.

598
01:00:43,275 --> 01:00:45,505
How was I to know Sapna
is the boss' daughter?

599
01:00:45,611 --> 01:00:48,171
I unnecessarily got into an
argument with her in the meeting.

600
01:00:50,215 --> 01:00:51,182
What now?

601
01:00:54,219 --> 01:00:56,585
Raj, Mr. Chhabria has
called you to his room.

602
01:00:57,222 --> 01:01:01,522
I've lost my job! Renu, I
don't want to lose this job.

603
01:01:01,627 --> 01:01:03,527
Don't say that,
everything will be alright.

604
01:01:03,629 --> 01:01:06,189
You go and apologise to her.

605
01:01:06,632 --> 01:01:09,192
Big people often forget small matters.

606
01:01:09,301 --> 01:01:12,202
This is no small matter. She
got angry and left the meeting.

607
01:01:13,672 --> 01:01:16,573
Now that she has called
you, you will have to go.

608
01:01:16,675 --> 01:01:17,607
Yes.

609
01:01:19,678 --> 01:01:25,583
Renu, you also come along with me.
- Me? Raju, I'll stay here.

610
01:01:25,884 --> 01:01:28,853
You'll stay here? Don't go, please.

611
01:01:29,221 --> 01:01:31,189
I'll stay here, and wait for you.

612
01:01:33,225 --> 01:01:34,192
Don't be afraid.

613
01:01:42,634 --> 01:01:43,601
Just a minute.

614
01:02:20,339 --> 01:02:23,274
Sir, before you say anything,
I'd like to say something.

615
01:02:23,408 --> 01:02:27,970
I know I made a mistake,
I should not have argued.

616
01:02:32,284 --> 01:02:35,981
You can see how upset I am. Actually,
I have a problem since childhood.

617
01:02:36,288 --> 01:02:41,248
I cannot sleep. And until I
cannot sleep....I stay awake.

618
01:02:42,294 --> 01:02:44,262
And when I am awake, I keep thinking.

619
01:02:47,299 --> 01:02:49,267
Madam, that's my problem.
I cannot sleep at night...

620
01:02:49,368 --> 01:02:51,666
I stay awake. lf I stay
awake, I don't sleep.

621
01:02:51,837 --> 01:02:53,270
And if I don't sleep, I keep thinking.

622
01:02:53,405 --> 01:02:55,703
And if I don't think, I speak.
You understand my problem, madam?

623
01:02:57,743 --> 01:02:59,677
Look how much I am talking even now,
because I have not slept at night.

624
01:03:01,346 --> 01:03:04,315
I was thinking something last night,
& said something else in the meeting.

625
01:03:04,416 --> 01:03:10,321
And in all the confusion,
I argued with madam.

626
01:03:11,356 --> 01:03:13,324
I had no intention to trouble you.

627
01:03:17,362 --> 01:03:18,329
Drink water.

628
01:03:27,339 --> 01:03:29,705
One feels thirsty too,
when one cannot sleep.

629
01:03:31,743 --> 01:03:36,043
Mr. Mathur, whatever you
said in the board meeting...

630
01:03:36,348 --> 01:03:38,714
the suggestions that you made...

631
01:03:39,351 --> 01:03:43,310
I want you to repeat those
suggestions before us again.

632
01:03:43,755 --> 01:03:47,316
I only wanted to say...
- Then say it.

633
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:52,319
Yes...Madam, I didn't mean what
I said in the board meeting.

634
01:03:52,431 --> 01:03:56,731
You didn't understand...
- Then explain to me, Mr. Mathur.

635
01:03:58,036 --> 01:03:59,003
Yes.

636
01:03:59,404 --> 01:04:00,735
It’s time to close the office.

637
01:04:14,419 --> 01:04:20,790
Mr. Mathur, Sapna and I
liked your suggestions.

638
01:04:22,427 --> 01:04:26,056
And we have decided to
give you a promotion.

639
01:04:29,368 --> 01:04:32,064
You liked my suggestions? Sir,
I have many more suggestions...

640
01:04:32,404 --> 01:04:33,735
This is enough for today.

641
01:04:35,407 --> 01:04:39,776
Mr. Mathur, we respect
people who work diligently.

642
01:04:40,512 --> 01:04:41,774
But remember one thing.

643
01:04:49,421 --> 01:04:51,787
I understand, sir. I will work hard.

644
01:04:53,825 --> 01:04:55,793
Sapna, you want to say something?

645
01:04:57,429 --> 01:04:58,794
From now on, we will work together.

646
01:04:59,498 --> 01:05:02,399
And am sure we will do good work.

647
01:05:28,427 --> 01:05:30,122
''There is a heart in my chest''

648
01:05:30,629 --> 01:05:32,790
''Heartbeats in my heart''

649
01:05:32,931 --> 01:05:35,798
''And just you in those heartbeats''

650
01:05:37,436 --> 01:05:40,803
''You are my first desire''

651
01:05:41,873 --> 01:05:45,400
''And my last wish!''

652
01:06:26,885 --> 01:06:30,844
''The weather melts into colours...''

653
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:34,857
''that you come in''

654
01:06:35,894 --> 01:06:39,853
''My mornings and evenings...''

655
01:06:40,499 --> 01:06:43,468
''all come under your lashes''

656
01:06:44,503 --> 01:06:52,467
''Sleep in my eyes, dreams in my
sleep, and only you in my dreams''
