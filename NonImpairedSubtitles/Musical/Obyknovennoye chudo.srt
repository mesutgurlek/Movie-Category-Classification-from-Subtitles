A USUAL WONDER
Part One

5
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,883  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Based on a play by Yevgenyi
SCHWARZ of the same name

6
00:01:26,247 --> 00:01:29,205  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's her. It's her footsteps.

7
00:01:50,447 --> 00:01:53,564  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've been in love with my wife
for 15 years. Like a schoolboy.

8
00:01:59,527 --> 00:02:01,245  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hello, my wife.

9
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:07,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Are you sore with someone?
- You.

10
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:14,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The boor. My God, what have
I done this time?

11
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:18,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What's all that mess in the
hen-house?

12
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,201  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I did that out of love.

13
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:23,724  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And who promised to live like
everyone else?

14
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:25,525  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Live like everyone else!

15
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:31,964  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Are you sore with someone?
- You.

16
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:39,365  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The boor! What have I done
this time?

17
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,522  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What's all that mess in the
hen-house?

18
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:43,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I did that out of love.

19
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:46,324  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And who promised to live like
everyone else?

20
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:52,043  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Live like everyone else...

21
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:35,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But after all I am a magician.

22
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:49,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm entitled to an
occasional prank.

23
00:03:50,007 --> 00:03:52,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You could have done something
useful for the household.

24
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:55,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They brought sand to
sprinkle the walks.

25
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:57,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why don't you turn it into
Sugar.

26
00:03:58,207 --> 00:03:59,526  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What kind of a prank is that?

27
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:04,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Or else turn the stones, piled
up at the barn, into cheese.

28
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:06,805  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Cheese? That's not funny.

29
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:09,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What am I to do with you?

30
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:14,046  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No matter how hard I try, you're
still the same crazy man.

31
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:19,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Who are you waiting for?
- No one.

32
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:22,166  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Look me in the eyes.
- I'm looking.

33
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:28,205  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Tell me the truth. What
guests are we expecting today?

34
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:32,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Will those be people or ghosts,
that will come to play with you?

35
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:52,686  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's all right, it's
all right...

36
00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:55,484  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Soon, soon!

37
00:04:56,527 --> 00:05:00,486  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who are you waiting for? You
think you can fool your wife?

38
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:02,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Tell me! Now!

39
00:05:03,527 --> 00:05:05,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We are having very unusual
guests today.

40
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:08,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This time I'm up to something
more than pranks or jokes.

41
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:10,885  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Please don't be sore.

42
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,564  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I knew who I was marrying.

43
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:16,485  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's him. It's him!

44
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:48,042  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've been expecting you.
Come in.

45
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:06,364  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hello, son.

46
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:11,281  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Seat yourself at the table,
have some coffee.

47
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:12,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What is your name?

48
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:17,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Bear.

49
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:22,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Bear...

50
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:31,246  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That nickname does not
become you.

51
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:33,361  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It is not a nickname.

52
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:53,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
7 years ago your husband put a
spell on me and made me human.

53
00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:57,884  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He did a wonderful job.

54
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:01,165  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He has hands of gold.

55
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:07,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thank you, son.

56
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:08,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Is that true?

57
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:12,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why didn't you tell me?

58
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:18,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I forgot.

59
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:24,682  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I was walking in the forest...

60
00:07:29,007 --> 00:07:34,365  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And I saw this young bear cub,
funny looking chap.

61
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:38,885  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Broad forehead, clever eyes.

62
00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:45,563  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I liked him.
- Stop it!

63
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:50,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I hate it when people abuse
animals out of fun.

64
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:54,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They make elephants dance,
lock nightingales into cages,

65
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and teach tigers swing on
a swing.

66
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:03,726  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Life is tough, son?

67
00:08:10,087 --> 00:08:11,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes.

68
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:15,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's not easy to be a real man.

69
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:20,926  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're laughing?

70
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:22,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm happy.

71
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:25,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Admiring my work.

72
00:08:26,447 --> 00:08:29,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A man makes a statue out of a
dead stone, and

73
00:08:29,847 --> 00:08:31,326  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
it makes him proud if it comes
out beautiful.

74
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:34,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But try turning a living
creature into an even more

75
00:08:35,247 --> 00:08:36,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
living one.
That's a challenge for you!

76
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:40,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's what I've been waiting
for for many years.

77
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:42,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
For many years.

78
00:08:43,127 --> 00:08:45,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Turn him back into a bear this
very minute,

79
00:08:45,687 --> 00:08:47,086  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
if you love me.

80
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:49,086  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Set him free.

81
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't worry!

82
00:08:54,807 --> 00:08:57,924  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's what he's here for -
to be turned into a bear again.

83
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,522  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm glad. Will you do it right
here?

84
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:02,325  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, that's no fun.

85
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:08,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Everything will be wonderful!
It will be different.

86
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:43,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It will be absolutely different.

87
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:51,121  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- It will be different.
- Will it happen now?

88
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:53,005  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, it's not that simple.

89
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:57,441  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I will turn back into a bear,
when a Princess...

90
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:00,200  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
falls in love with me and
kisses me.

91
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,279  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Did you think of that?
- I think it's good, don't you?

92
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:07,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- But that's awful!
- I didn't please you again!

93
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:11,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Did you think about her?
- It's healthy to fall in love.

94
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:15,523  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She will fall in love, and he
will turn into an animal.

95
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:17,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- That's nothing unusual. - He
will run away into the forest.

96
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:19,726  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That happens too, they run away.

97
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,806  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You will leave a girl who is in
love with you, son?

98
00:10:31,527 --> 00:10:36,681  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Soon as she sees that I'm a
bear, she will fall out of love.

99
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:42,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Not that I want to frighten you,
but it is a dangerous game.

100
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:46,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I though I could take anything,
but this time I'm afraid.

101
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,485  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But what can happen?

102
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:53,124  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're afraid she won't fall in
love? Of course she will!

103
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:56,245  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Look, how charming he is.

104
00:10:58,767 --> 00:10:59,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What if...

105
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:11,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's too late anyway!

106
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:17,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've arranged it so that one
of the kings...

107
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:20,684  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
would want to make a detour
and visit our house.

108
00:11:22,007 --> 00:11:23,281  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's on his way here now.

109
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:46,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Go hide yourself, son. We will
meet them ourselves.

110
00:11:47,087 --> 00:11:49,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll call you when the time
comeS.

111
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:54,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I don't believe it! A king!
- Wait till you see him!

112
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:55,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's a boor and a churl!

113
00:11:56,167 --> 00:12:00,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He'll make a nuisance of himself
and order us about.

114
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:04,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Good day.

115
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,645  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My friends, I am a King.

116
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:13,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Good day, Your Majesty.

117
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:20,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
For some reason I found your
house extremely attractive.

118
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:24,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So allow me to visit with you
for a couple of days.

119
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:28,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I must warn you, we're a
troublesome bunch.

120
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:31,044  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I am an impossible person.

121
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:36,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A tyrant, a despot. Insidious
and unforgiving.

122
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,283  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Someone - come here!
You, for instance!

123
00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:45,086  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Say hello to them.

124
00:12:45,607 --> 00:12:47,325  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
See, what I'm doing?

125
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:52,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And the interesting thing is,
it's not my fault.

126
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:54,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's the truth.

127
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:55,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now beat it!

128
00:12:56,727 --> 00:13:00,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm not to blame!
It's the ancestry.

129
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:04,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Great grandfathers, grand-uncles
and all sorts of aunts,

130
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:09,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
all my ancestors always behaved
like complete pigs.

131
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:13,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And now I have to pay for their
past.

132
00:13:13,407 --> 00:13:15,204  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What can I say? Parasites!

133
00:13:15,447 --> 00:13:19,042  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Pardon my language.
Parasites! That's the word.

134
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:21,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
By my nature I am kind and
gentle.

135
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:25,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm into poetry, prose, music,
art, fiishing.

136
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:26,922  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I like cats.

137
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:30,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But occasionally I can pull
something weird.

138
00:13:32,527 --> 00:13:34,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Like this, for instance.
- Joker!

139
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:36,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're a funny man yourself.

140
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:38,804  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Mistress, give us three
goblets.

141
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:42,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It is the King's vintage wine
that's 300 years old.

142
00:13:42,927 --> 00:13:47,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's drink to our acquaintance!
Here's to us!

143
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:50,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Bottoms up!

144
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:52,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Don't drink.
- Why?

145
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:55,160  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You don't respect your guest?
- Quiet, you're not at home.

146
00:13:55,407 --> 00:13:56,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't order me about!

147
00:13:56,647 --> 00:13:59,207  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I blink my eye, and the
ministers will act,

148
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:01,005  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and express their condolences,
and that'll be it!

149
00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:04,205  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't! The wine is poisoned.

150
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:07,007  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Well listen to the scoundrel!
- Then you drink first.

151
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,926  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All right, the wine is poisoned.

152
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:12,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why through it away? Pour it
back into the bottle.

153
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:15,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This is high quality poison.
Hard to get.

154
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:17,445  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Can always come in handy.

155
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:20,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Shame on you, Your Majesty!
- I'm not to blame!

156
00:14:20,687 --> 00:14:21,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Who is?
- My uncle.

157
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:25,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He would often talk too much,
slander himself, and with

158
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:30,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
his delicate and vulnerable
soul, you know, to spare himself

159
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:34,364  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
the agony of remorse, he would
afterwards poison his vis-a-vis.

160
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Bastard.
- Animal!

161
00:14:36,447 --> 00:14:38,165  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You ought to be ashamed.
- Oh, don't start.

162
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:41,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now you're gonna say, I must be
responsible for my own actions.

163
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:45,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And not put the blame on
friends, neighbors or relatives.

164
00:14:45,287 --> 00:14:47,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm only human! It's more
than I can do!

165
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:51,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I am a King. Just your
ordinary King.

166
00:14:51,447 --> 00:14:53,802  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There are thousands like me.

167
00:14:54,447 --> 00:14:57,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We understand one another.
Why pretend?!

168
00:14:57,847 --> 00:14:59,326  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And don't frown!

169
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:03,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We're alive and kicking!
We're staying here!

170
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:07,522  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Courtiers! Make yourselves
comfortable! Put the music on!

171
00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:13,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If I may ask, King, is the
Princess also...

172
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Of course not! She's not like
that. She's kind and sweet.

173
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:18,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Living with me is hard on her.

174
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:22,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Her mother died when she was
only 7 minutes old.

175
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:25,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- So don't you be rude to her.
- Your Majesty!

176
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:29,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I stop being a King when I
think of her or see her.

177
00:15:29,927 --> 00:15:31,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Dear friends!

178
00:15:32,447 --> 00:15:34,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm so happy that I love...

179
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
my child so much!

180
00:15:55,447 --> 00:16:00,567  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How funny and crazy,
Absurd and untimely...

181
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,165  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And how wonderful!

182
00:16:03,607 --> 00:16:09,284  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Without any reason or
Meaning

183
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:12,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
At all!

184
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:25,126  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There comes a day,
There strikes an hour,

185
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:28,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There comes a moment,
There comes the right time,

186
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:32,962  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And the connection breaks.

187
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:37,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Granite boils,
Ice catches fire,

188
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:41,201  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Light down
Knocks you off your feet.

189
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:44,962  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What madness?!

190
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:49,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Weeds blossom,

191
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:53,122  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The old owl sings like a
nightingale,

192
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:56,962  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And even the thinnest of
threads

193
00:16:57,367 --> 00:17:00,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Can not be cut in half

194
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:04,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
By a steel blade,

195
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:09,604  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
By a steel blade!

196
00:17:11,527 --> 00:17:17,284  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How funny and crazy,
Absurd and untimely

197
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:20,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And how wonderful!

198
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:26,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Without any reason or
Meaning

199
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:28,483  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
At all!

200
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:41,406  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There comes a time,
And it brings

201
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:45,123  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Shivers and fear,
And a secret fever,

202
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:48,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Power and delight,

203
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:53,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Pain and laughter,
Light and shadow,

204
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:56,803  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All thrown into one fiire,
Into one burning flame.

205
00:17:57,127 --> 00:18:00,802  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What madness?!

206
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And out of this mirage,
Out of nothing,

207
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:08,602  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Out of my own wild fantasies

208
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:12,760  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Appears someone's face,

209
00:18:13,087 --> 00:18:16,443  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And it acquires shape and
Color,

210
00:18:16,687 --> 00:18:20,441  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Flesh and passion,

211
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:25,602  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Flesh and passion!

212
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:33,163  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How funny and crazy,
Absurd and untimely,

213
00:18:33,927 --> 00:18:35,645  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And how wonderful!

214
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:42,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Without any reason or
Meaning

215
00:18:42,327 --> 00:18:44,602  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
At all!

216
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:02,846  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She is extraordinary!

217
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:11,682  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Not at all like a King's
daughter.

218
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:17,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She's extraordinary!

219
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:20,886  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Not at all like a King's
daughter.

220
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:27,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I used to come to the nursery

221
00:19:28,007 --> 00:19:32,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and, believe it or not,
I felt better about myself.

222
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:41,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Or I would sit there signing a
death sentence,

223
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:45,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and laugh at her little
pranks.

224
00:19:46,927 --> 00:19:49,805  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I know, I'm a self-centered
bastard!

225
00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:52,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I got so used to warming my
heart being next to her,

226
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
that I started to protect her
from anything

227
00:19:56,927 --> 00:19:58,724  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
that could stain her pure soul.

228
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:04,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Surely you know what a royal
court is like.

229
00:20:07,087 --> 00:20:11,365  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Every day they strangle their
own brothers and sisters.

230
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:14,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's right, strangle them.

231
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:17,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
In other words, there's this
usual everyday life going on.

232
00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:22,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But once you enter the wing
of the princess,

233
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:25,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
there's pleasant conversation,
poetry, music.

234
00:20:26,247 --> 00:20:27,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It heals your soul.

235
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:31,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And that tranquil world
collapsed because of a trifle.

236
00:20:32,527 --> 00:20:33,846  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I remember it clearly.

237
00:20:35,247 --> 00:20:37,442  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It was Saturday, I was doing
my homework,

238
00:20:37,687 --> 00:20:41,680  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
looking through cavils of
my ministers,

239
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
When there was a knock at the
door. My daughter was by my side

240
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
embroidering a scarf for my
Birthday.

241
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:52,364  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It was all so calm and peaceful,
birds were singing.

242
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Then the Master of Ceremonies
breaks the bad news.

243
00:20:55,607 --> 00:20:57,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Says, her aunt, the Dutchess,
was coming to visit.

244
00:20:57,927 --> 00:21:00,521  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I always hated her shrill
voice.

245
00:21:02,447 --> 00:21:05,200  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So I tell him to tell her,
we're not in.

246
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:07,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's not anything unusual
for us,

247
00:21:07,687 --> 00:21:09,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
because we're ordinary
people.

248
00:21:09,927 --> 00:21:12,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But my poor little girl
fainted.

249
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:21,403  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
''Her daddy told a lie!''

250
00:21:22,327 --> 00:21:24,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's how it all started.

251
00:21:26,527 --> 00:21:29,963  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She became thoughtful and looked
bored. I didn't know what to do.

252
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:34,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Then the genes of my great
granddad awakened in me.

253
00:21:34,687 --> 00:21:38,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Whatever trouble happened, he
didn't do anything at all,

254
00:21:38,487 --> 00:21:39,886  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
but waited for it to pass.

255
00:21:40,127 --> 00:21:42,766  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
When they were strangling his
beloved wife before his eyes,

256
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:46,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
he stood there and begged:
''Hold on, it'll pass''.

257
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:49,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Nice man!
- Oh sure!

258
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:54,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But then I woke up one night
and I said: Harness the horses!

259
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:59,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And at sunrise we were already
rushing in the direction of

260
00:21:59,727 --> 00:22:02,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
the Carpathian Mountains.
We don't know anyone here,

261
00:22:04,447 --> 00:22:07,200  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
so you will have to bear
with us,

262
00:22:07,447 --> 00:22:10,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
until we build a castle with
all the conveniences,

263
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:13,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
a garden, a prison cell,
and a playground.

264
00:22:13,927 --> 00:22:15,724  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I'm afraid...
- Don't be.

265
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:20,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Your Majesty, I will show
you your roomS.

266
00:22:20,927 --> 00:22:24,522  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Careful, watch your step.

267
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:26,962  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This way, your Majesty.

268
00:22:30,927 --> 00:22:34,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Just imagine him turning into a
wild beast before her very eyes.

269
00:22:34,807 --> 00:22:37,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- It's good to fall in love!
- I won't allow this.

270
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:40,166  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That would be painful even
for a mature woman.

271
00:22:40,407 --> 00:22:42,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Tell me it's a joke.
- It's too late!

272
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:46,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No! I will ask the
Bear to wait,

273
00:22:46,287 --> 00:22:48,926  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
until we find another princess.

274
00:22:49,527 --> 00:22:52,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I need to talk to you in
private. In the garden.

275
00:22:52,927 --> 00:22:53,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Quick!

276
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:18,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm sorry if I hurt you,
charming young lady.

277
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:21,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What is it? Did I scare you
so much?

278
00:23:22,247 --> 00:23:25,603  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No. I'm just a little shaken.

279
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:30,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I have never been called
''charming young lady'' before.

280
00:23:32,847 --> 00:23:34,405  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I didn't want to offend you.

281
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:37,646  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm not offended.

282
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:47,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's just that I can't
tell a lie.

283
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,043  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If I see a charming young lady,

284
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:52,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I tell her so.

285
00:23:57,447 --> 00:24:00,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Are you the owner's son?
- No, I am an orphan.

286
00:24:05,007 --> 00:24:05,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Me too.

287
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:09,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I mean, my father is alive,
but my mother died

288
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:12,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
when I was only 7 minutes
old.

289
00:24:13,167 --> 00:24:15,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm sure you have many
friends.

290
00:24:19,007 --> 00:24:20,565  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why would you say that?

291
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:23,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I think, everyone should love
someone like you.

292
00:24:52,247 --> 00:24:54,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I think, everyone should love
someone like you.

293
00:25:07,687 --> 00:25:10,804  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You are extraordinary,
you are gentle.

294
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:14,405  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Have I offended you now?

295
00:25:17,007 --> 00:25:17,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No.

296
00:25:20,247 --> 00:25:22,602  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Then I will tell you,
that you are beautiful.

297
00:25:23,847 --> 00:25:25,565  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And that I came to
like you.

298
00:25:27,087 --> 00:25:29,647  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Very much. The moment
I saw you.

299
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:38,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you fiind me funny?

300
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:40,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No.

301
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:54,165  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I think, everyone should love
someone like you.

302
00:25:57,007 --> 00:25:59,805  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You are so extraordinary,
so gentle.

303
00:26:02,927 --> 00:26:05,680  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Have I offended you now?
- No.

304
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:10,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Then I will tell you,
that you are beautiful.

305
00:26:31,607 --> 00:26:35,122  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And that I came to like you.
At first sight.

306
00:26:37,367 --> 00:26:38,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you fiind me funny?

307
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:44,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No.

308
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:04,362  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You must be tired and hungry.

309
00:27:05,687 --> 00:27:08,281  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There's milk fresh from a cow.

310
00:27:13,087 --> 00:27:14,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Have some.

311
00:27:23,687 --> 00:27:26,406  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Is it some holiday today?
- I don't know, maybe.

312
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:29,764  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Are you one of the King's
suite? - No.

313
00:27:30,007 --> 00:27:31,804  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Then one of the Princess's
suite?

314
00:27:33,687 --> 00:27:36,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What if I am the Princess?

315
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:50,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What is it? You grew so pale!

316
00:27:53,607 --> 00:27:58,123  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, you can't be the
Princess.

317
00:27:59,687 --> 00:28:00,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No!

318
00:28:03,167 --> 00:28:04,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I roamed the world.

319
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I saw many princesses.

320
00:28:13,007 --> 00:28:14,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You don't look like any
one of them.

321
00:28:23,007 --> 00:28:23,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Please...

322
00:28:28,247 --> 00:28:29,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't tease me.

323
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:32,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Touch on any subject but
this one.

324
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:37,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My god! I forgot all about
them.

325
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,724  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The suite has arrived.

326
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:43,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yesterday's homely faces.

327
00:29:02,687 --> 00:29:04,325  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's hide from them.

328
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:07,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Run! Fast!

329
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:22,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My god!

330
00:29:24,247 --> 00:29:28,525  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why is it that I cry and laugh
like a child!

331
00:29:31,087 --> 00:29:33,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How dare you? I begged
you not to.

332
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,884  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hello there, beautiful!

333
00:29:53,247 --> 00:29:55,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sorry for the intrusion.

334
00:29:56,247 --> 00:29:58,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I hope I'm not interfering with
anything? You want me to leave?

335
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:02,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, of course not!
Please do sit down.

336
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:10,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- May I put down my bundle?
- Well of course!

337
00:30:18,087 --> 00:30:19,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You are so kind.

338
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:28,564  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What a charming cozy home!

339
00:30:30,447 --> 00:30:34,281  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There's a handle for the spit,
and a hook for the cattle.

340
00:30:36,927 --> 00:30:38,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You must be the King's
cook!

341
00:30:44,687 --> 00:30:47,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No. I am the King's First
Minister.

342
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:52,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Who?
- The King's First Minister.

343
00:30:59,687 --> 00:31:02,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There was a time when everyone
recognized me.

344
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:06,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I was so brilliant,
so grand!

345
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:10,165  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Experts say, it was diffiicult
to tell,

346
00:31:10,407 --> 00:31:13,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
who had more stature:
me or the King's cats.

347
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:20,680  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now I dance stupid dances
for everyone's amusement.

348
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:23,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm no longer good
for anything else.

349
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:25,285  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Am I any good?

350
00:31:26,687 --> 00:31:30,726  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I don't think so.
- I don't think so either.

351
00:31:31,527 --> 00:31:33,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'd say, quite mediocre.

352
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:38,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What brought you to
such a poor state?

353
00:31:38,327 --> 00:31:41,285  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's the traveling,
my lady.

354
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:45,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
For certain reasons we,
a group of courtiers,

355
00:31:45,887 --> 00:31:48,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
were torn away from our
habitual atmosphere

356
00:31:48,447 --> 00:31:50,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and sent away to a foreign
land.

357
00:31:50,607 --> 00:31:53,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And to add insult to injury
there's this tyrant.

358
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:55,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- The King?
- No, of course not!

359
00:31:57,087 --> 00:31:59,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We've gotten used to his
whims.

360
00:32:05,247 --> 00:32:08,364  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The tyrant is the Minister
Administrator.

361
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:11,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He alone knows how to
travel,

362
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:14,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
get us horses, feed everyone.

363
00:32:14,527 --> 00:32:17,564  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He does a rotten job, but thinks
everyone else is no good.

364
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:20,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Only don't tell him I was
complaining.

365
00:32:20,727 --> 00:32:23,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Or he will leave me without
dessert.

366
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:25,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why don't you tell the king?

367
00:32:28,607 --> 00:32:34,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
As they say in the business
circles, he services and serves

368
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:39,606  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
the King so well, he doesn't
want to hear anything about it.

369
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:44,403  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What a shame! What a disgrace!
What a bedlam!

370
00:32:44,647 --> 00:32:46,444  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What is this anyway?

371
00:32:46,687 --> 00:32:48,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He'll starve everyone
to death.

372
00:32:49,247 --> 00:32:51,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I wish he were dead!
But that's wishful thinking!

373
00:32:51,487 --> 00:32:53,205  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What can you expect of the
parasite!

374
00:32:53,447 --> 00:32:55,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What do I need my head for,

375
00:32:55,847 --> 00:32:57,565  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If I hadn't washed it
For three days!

376
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:04,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where's the soap? Where's
The bast? Where?

377
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:08,284  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where's the cream? Even
A shaving cream would do.

378
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:12,842  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
One who economizes on
Being clean

379
00:33:13,087 --> 00:33:16,363  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Is either a thief, or
A swine!

380
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:19,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He is either a thief,
Or a pig!

381
00:33:21,607 --> 00:33:24,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where is the soap? Where is
The bast? Where?

382
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:28,043  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where is the cream? Where?

383
00:33:28,767 --> 00:33:31,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
One who economizes on
Being clean

384
00:33:32,687 --> 00:33:36,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Is either a thief, or a pig!

385
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:39,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Damn him, when will
this torture end?

386
00:33:39,807 --> 00:33:42,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We will all become mangy
before long,

387
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:46,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
before this venomous creature
will deign to give us soap.

388
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:50,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Allow me to introduce
the First Court Dame!

389
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:54,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Maids of honor,
Orynthia and Amanda!

390
00:33:55,727 --> 00:33:57,001  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's outrageous!

391
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:59,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Today His Excellency,
damn him,

392
00:33:59,927 --> 00:34:02,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
refused to give us soap,
powder and perfume!

393
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,526  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I am sure he sold all
that to the natives!

394
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:09,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
When we left, he only had
a hat box

395
00:34:09,727 --> 00:34:12,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
with a sandwich and old torn
drawers,

396
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,401  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and now he has 33 small coffers
and 22 suitcases!

397
00:34:15,647 --> 00:34:18,559  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Would you like to take a bath?
- But we don't have soap!

398
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:22,686  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- We have soap and hot water.
- Hot water?!

399
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:24,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She's a saint!

400
00:34:25,927 --> 00:34:28,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A bath! Memories of our
old settled life!

401
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,761  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What utter joy!
- Tss! He's coming!

402
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:33,846  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's almost here!

403
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:38,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Please, not a word!
I didn't tell you anything!

404
00:35:26,687 --> 00:35:27,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hello.

405
00:35:31,847 --> 00:35:34,407  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I said, hello.
- I already saw you today.

406
00:35:36,007 --> 00:35:38,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Where is our luggage?
- Look at these people!

407
00:35:39,607 --> 00:35:42,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They only think about
themselves!

408
00:35:49,007 --> 00:35:54,001  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If you bother me again, I'll
leave you without your lunch.

409
00:35:54,247 --> 00:35:56,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That goes for everyone
else too.

410
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:03,564  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
4 pounds to the courtiers.

411
00:36:05,087 --> 00:36:06,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Minus 2...

412
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:08,846  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
3 pounds to the King.

413
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:12,280  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Minus one and a half.

414
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:15,362  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
1 pound to the Princess.

415
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:19,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Minus half a pound.

416
00:36:20,087 --> 00:36:23,523  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All in all 6 pounds today so
far. Not bad.

417
00:36:27,087 --> 00:36:29,806  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- At midnight.
- What?

418
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:33,927  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Come by the barn, you
won't regret it.

419
00:36:38,687 --> 00:36:40,564  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't have time for
courtship.

420
00:36:41,447 --> 00:36:43,165  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're an attractive woman.

421
00:36:43,847 --> 00:36:47,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I am an extremely
attractive man.

422
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:51,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why waste time?
I'll be there at midnight.

423
00:36:54,687 --> 00:36:57,247  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- How dare you?!
- Always, darling.

424
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:00,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're crazy?

425
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:03,286  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
On the contrary, I'm as
sane as a man can be.

426
00:37:03,527 --> 00:37:07,281  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You are a bastard.
- Yes. Who isn't?

427
00:37:08,087 --> 00:37:11,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Today, for instance,
I see a butterfly flying.

428
00:37:11,487 --> 00:37:15,241  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Small head, no brains.

429
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:19,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Flips her winds - tit, tit, tit.
Can't be any more stupid.

430
00:37:19,847 --> 00:37:21,963  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The sparrow was no better.

431
00:37:23,087 --> 00:37:25,885  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The birch tree - a dim-wit.
The oak tree - a moron.

432
00:37:26,367 --> 00:37:29,643  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The river - an imbecile.
The clouds - idiots.

433
00:37:30,607 --> 00:37:33,041  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All horses - traitors.

434
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:35,361  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All people - swindlers.

435
00:37:35,767 --> 00:37:39,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What to do? The world is such,
we shouldn't think twice.

436
00:38:02,007 --> 00:38:04,760  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It is good if there is
a woman around.

437
00:38:05,007 --> 00:38:07,680  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A lady, a dame, signora,
Le femme.

438
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:11,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And the most important thing
For a woman is her good honor,

439
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:15,204  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
When there's a Man around.

440
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:18,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And everywhere, especially
Here,

441
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:23,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where nature is tranquil
And innocent,

442
00:38:25,527 --> 00:38:31,523  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And the butterfly goes:
Tit-tit-tit,

443
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:37,600  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And the sparrow chases her:
Tat-tat-tat,

444
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:42,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And he catches the baby:
Dang-dang-dang,

445
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:46,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yummy-yummy-yummy,
And goes: split-split-split.

446
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:54,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The butterfly flips her wings:
Tit-tit-tit,

447
00:38:56,527 --> 00:39:00,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The sparrow chases her;
Tat-tat-tat,

448
00:39:01,327 --> 00:39:05,002  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He catches the baby:
Dang-dang-dang,

449
00:39:05,647 --> 00:39:07,205  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yummy-yummy-yummy!

450
00:39:07,927 --> 00:39:09,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And goes: split-split-split!

451
00:39:14,447 --> 00:39:17,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You are my angel,
You are my ideal,

452
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:20,804  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My shining star,
My luscious berry,

453
00:39:21,607 --> 00:39:24,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Your teeth are pearls,
Your lips - corals.

454
00:39:25,007 --> 00:39:27,965  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Your breasts and your smile
Are not bad either.

455
00:39:28,847 --> 00:39:31,964  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've never met anyone like you,

456
00:39:32,207 --> 00:39:35,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And I want to correct that
mistake.

457
00:39:37,727 --> 00:39:43,723  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The butterfly flips her wings:
Tit-tit-tit,

458
00:39:46,527 --> 00:39:50,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And the sparrow chases her:
Tat-tat-tat,

459
00:39:51,247 --> 00:39:54,922  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He catches the baby:
Dang-dang-dang,

460
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:59,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yummy-yummy-yummy, and he
Goes: split-split-split.

461
00:40:01,127 --> 00:40:07,123  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The butterfly flips her wings:
Tit-tit-tit,

462
00:40:10,847 --> 00:40:14,760  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And the sparrow chases her:
tat-tat-tat,

463
00:40:15,367 --> 00:40:19,280  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He catches the baby:
Dang-dang-dang,

464
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:23,841  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yummy-yummy-yummy, and then
he goes: Split-split-split.

465
00:40:24,087 --> 00:40:26,885  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So you will come then?

466
00:40:28,687 --> 00:40:29,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That is out of the question.

467
00:40:30,527 --> 00:40:33,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Wait till husband
turns you into a rat.

468
00:40:34,087 --> 00:40:37,762  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What is your husband?
- A magician.

469
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:40,646  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You should have told me.

470
00:40:44,447 --> 00:40:46,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I was wrong. Blew my top.

471
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:50,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's consider this
a misunderstanding.

472
00:40:50,327 --> 00:40:53,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I ask your permission to let
me redress my wrong.

473
00:40:58,847 --> 00:40:59,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Music!

474
00:41:15,527 --> 00:41:18,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I say, I really like it here!

475
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:21,326  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This house is so full of good
attitude and love!

476
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I could take it for myself.
Honest to god!

477
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's a good thing I came
here.

478
00:41:26,927 --> 00:41:29,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
At home I would most probably
lock you away in the Tower.

479
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:33,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's the one in the Market
Square. Awesome place.

480
00:41:33,767 --> 00:41:36,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You remember? Hot in the
daytime, cold at night.

481
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:40,764  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The inmates suffer so much,
the even the warden cries.

482
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:45,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Cries out of pity, you
understand?

483
00:41:46,327 --> 00:41:49,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I could jail him for that.

484
00:41:49,527 --> 00:41:51,279  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Sure! And take his house!
- Monster.

485
00:41:51,567 --> 00:41:54,286  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I am a King - from head to toe!

486
00:41:54,527 --> 00:41:57,325  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He thinks there are
better kings than I am.

487
00:41:57,607 --> 00:42:00,167  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We're all monsters!
Alike like twin brothers.

488
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:02,564  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My lady, please.

489
00:42:04,687 --> 00:42:06,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where is my daughter,
anyway?

490
00:42:07,007 --> 00:42:09,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The Princess asked us to
leave her alone.

491
00:42:09,647 --> 00:42:12,559  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Her Highness wanted to pick
flowers...

492
00:42:12,807 --> 00:42:14,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
in solitude.

493
00:42:15,087 --> 00:42:19,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How could she leave my
child all by herself?.

494
00:42:19,767 --> 00:42:23,362  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There can be snakes in the
grass, she may catch cold.

495
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- How come?
- Because the river is cold.

496
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:29,806  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There she is.

497
00:42:31,087 --> 00:42:33,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Safe and sound.

498
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:42,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There she is!

499
00:42:43,447 --> 00:42:46,166  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My daughter!

500
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,727  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My only child! She's
smiling!

501
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:53,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Now she's contemplating!
- She smiled again!

502
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:57,002  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What a charming smile!

503
00:42:58,087 --> 00:43:00,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who is that young man
with her?

504
00:43:01,847 --> 00:43:04,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I can see she likes him!
Then I like him too.

505
00:43:05,367 --> 00:43:07,005  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Are his parents still living?
- They passed away.

506
00:43:07,247 --> 00:43:08,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's wonderful!

507
00:43:08,487 --> 00:43:10,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Any brothers and sisters?
- None.

508
00:43:13,167 --> 00:43:15,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I shall grant him a title
and make him rich,

509
00:43:15,647 --> 00:43:18,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and let him travel with us.

510
00:43:18,447 --> 00:43:20,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He can't be all too bad,

511
00:43:21,087 --> 00:43:24,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
since my girl likes him
so much.

512
00:43:27,087 --> 00:43:29,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Is he a good boy?
- Very! But...

513
00:43:29,727 --> 00:43:30,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No ''buts''!

514
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:34,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I haven't seen my girl
so happy for years.

515
00:43:34,367 --> 00:43:36,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There can be no ''buts''!

516
00:43:40,167 --> 00:43:41,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Today I'm having a ball.

517
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:44,166  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I shall be joyful and
good-natured,

518
00:43:44,407 --> 00:43:46,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and allow myselfjust a
few harmless pranks.

519
00:43:47,847 --> 00:43:52,921  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Get the chinaware ready.
I shall break plates today.

520
00:43:55,327 --> 00:43:56,885  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Take the bread out of
the barn.

521
00:43:57,847 --> 00:44:00,361  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I will set the barn on fire.

522
00:44:08,247 --> 00:44:09,885  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hello, everyone.

523
00:44:18,927 --> 00:44:22,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I saw all of you today, but it
seems it was ages ago.

524
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:24,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Ladies and gentlemen!

525
00:44:27,327 --> 00:44:30,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This young man is my
best friend.

526
00:44:33,007 --> 00:44:35,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I always envied girls,

527
00:44:35,567 --> 00:44:38,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
who had brothers, but now I
think it was silly of me,

528
00:44:38,727 --> 00:44:42,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
because I like him more
than a brother.

529
00:44:42,527 --> 00:44:44,006  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They fight with brothers,

530
00:44:44,247 --> 00:44:46,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
but I couldn't fight with
him.

531
00:44:46,807 --> 00:44:48,445  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He loves the things
that I love.

532
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:52,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He understands me and I
understand him, like myself.

533
00:44:58,167 --> 00:45:00,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You see, he's sore with me?

534
00:45:01,367 --> 00:45:02,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know why?

535
00:45:05,247 --> 00:45:07,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Because I didn't tell him
I was a Princess.

536
00:45:07,807 --> 00:45:09,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And he hates princesses.

537
00:45:12,007 --> 00:45:13,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes, that's true!

538
00:45:18,607 --> 00:45:22,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know, I would want him

539
00:45:24,927 --> 00:45:28,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
to see, how different I am
from all the other princesses.

540
00:45:29,847 --> 00:45:32,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I hate them too, darling.

541
00:45:32,807 --> 00:45:35,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't be so terrified.

542
00:45:35,367 --> 00:45:37,483  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're scaring me!

543
00:45:40,167 --> 00:45:42,806  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Would you like me to kiss you?

544
00:45:50,927 --> 00:45:51,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No.

545
00:45:53,247 --> 00:45:54,362  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Not ever!

546
00:45:56,007 --> 00:45:57,201  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Not ever!

547
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:01,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I have to go.

548
00:46:03,367 --> 00:46:04,766  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You will never see me again.

549
00:46:06,247 --> 00:46:09,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Get him! Stop him!

550
00:46:30,007 --> 00:46:32,805  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know him well.
Was it something I said?

551
00:46:33,087 --> 00:46:35,806  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, sweetheart.
You didn't do anything wrong.

552
00:46:37,087 --> 00:46:40,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He didn't like it when I said
about the brothers.

553
00:46:41,047 --> 00:46:44,801  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I must have been too
straightforward!

554
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:46,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And then...

555
00:46:47,247 --> 00:46:49,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How could I have forgotten
myself! The most shameful part!

556
00:46:49,487 --> 00:46:51,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I offered to kiss him.

557
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,966  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- And he... - He saddled his
horse and went away!

558
00:46:53,207 --> 00:46:55,846  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
On that crazy horse of his!
Off into the mountains!

559
00:46:56,087 --> 00:46:58,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
With no road lying ahead.

560
00:47:00,327 --> 00:47:03,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Daughter... Where are you
going? Come back!

561
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:05,843  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Come back!

562
00:47:31,447 --> 00:47:33,722  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Executioner! Get ready!

563
00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:53,727  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Courtiers! Say your
prayers!

564
00:47:58,847 --> 00:48:03,125  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The Princess locked herself in
her room. You will be executed.

565
00:48:03,367 --> 00:48:05,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Your Majesty, I think...

566
00:48:05,607 --> 00:48:08,121  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The sand-glass! Fast!

567
00:48:14,367 --> 00:48:15,402  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I shall spare the life
of anyone,

568
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:20,363  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
who, while the sand runs
in the sand-glass,

569
00:48:21,087 --> 00:48:25,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
will teach me, what to do
with the Princess.

570
00:48:25,847 --> 00:48:26,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Think!

571
00:48:28,527 --> 00:48:31,963  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Think! The sand runs fast.

572
00:48:38,527 --> 00:48:43,123  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Take your turns, and speak
plainly and clearly.

573
00:48:44,767 --> 00:48:45,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The First Minister!

574
00:48:49,087 --> 00:48:52,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Your Majesty! In my opinion,
parents should not

575
00:48:52,807 --> 00:48:55,480  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
interfere in the love
lives of their children.

576
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:57,246  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You will die first.

577
00:49:00,847 --> 00:49:02,565  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Speak, my lady.

578
00:49:03,447 --> 00:49:05,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Many years ago, Your Majesty,

579
00:49:06,247 --> 00:49:08,807  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I stood at the window, and
a young man on a black horse

580
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:11,686  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
was rushing away along a
mountainous path.

581
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:14,323  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It was a quiet moonlit night.

582
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:19,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- And a clatter of hoofs...
- Get to the point, you fool.

583
00:49:19,927 --> 00:49:21,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- The sand is running.
- Don't interrupt her.

584
00:49:22,087 --> 00:49:25,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- But there are many of us.
- And only one sand-glass.

585
00:49:25,327 --> 00:49:26,726  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What will be left for us?

586
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:29,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Go on.

587
00:49:29,847 --> 00:49:31,644  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I never saw him again.

588
00:49:33,767 --> 00:49:35,485  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And I married someone else.

589
00:49:36,167 --> 00:49:40,843  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And here I am, alive and
at Your Majesty's service.

590
00:49:41,087 --> 00:49:43,806  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You too will have your
head chopped off.

591
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:45,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Your turn.

592
00:49:46,007 --> 00:49:49,602  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The best way to console
the Princess -

593
00:49:49,847 --> 00:49:52,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
is to let her marry someone,
who is loyal to the King,

594
00:49:53,247 --> 00:49:55,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
has some experience in life
and an administrator's skills,

595
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,685  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and who is one of the
King's suite.

596
00:49:57,927 --> 00:49:59,645  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Are you talking about
the executioner?

597
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:03,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
God no! I don't know him
that well.

598
00:50:03,727 --> 00:50:04,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You will.

599
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My child! What is it?

600
00:50:19,687 --> 00:50:21,086  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You are frightening me?

601
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:24,486  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where are you going?

602
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I won't tell anyone.

603
00:50:34,927 --> 00:50:36,246  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Good girl!

604
00:50:38,767 --> 00:50:40,962  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Child, we are going
with you!

605
00:50:55,367 --> 00:50:56,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Father!

606
00:51:00,607 --> 00:51:01,926  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I love you so much.

607
00:51:02,607 --> 00:51:04,404  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't be sore with me,
but I'm leaving alone.

608
00:51:04,647 --> 00:51:06,046  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Stop her! Fast!

609
00:51:06,287 --> 00:51:07,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I swear!

610
00:51:09,047 --> 00:51:11,686  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I will kill anyone who
follows me.

611
00:51:12,607 --> 00:51:14,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Remember this.

612
00:51:16,087 --> 00:51:19,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I have my own life now,
and I want to be left alone.

613
00:51:19,887 --> 00:51:20,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Stop her!

614
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:24,924  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Stop her at any cost!

615
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:30,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Stop her!

616
00:51:31,527 --> 00:51:32,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Stop her!

617
00:51:53,687 --> 00:51:55,006  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What a girl!

618
00:51:57,087 --> 00:52:00,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
In the mountains she'll catch
cold and lose her way!

619
00:52:00,567 --> 00:52:03,286  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
she will fall off the horse,
tangle her foot in the stirrup!

620
00:52:03,527 --> 00:52:05,245  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't just stand there!
Go after her!

621
00:52:05,487 --> 00:52:08,923  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She will shoot anyone,
who follows her!

622
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:12,762  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I will follow her, hiding
behind big stones.

623
00:52:13,007 --> 00:52:15,282  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What are you talking
about?

624
00:52:16,847 --> 00:52:19,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I shall crawl in the grass
like a snake.

625
00:52:20,087 --> 00:52:21,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But I shall not abandon
her!

626
00:52:21,327 --> 00:52:23,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Follow me!
- Wait!

627
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:44,926  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Are you happy now?

628
00:54:12,087 --> 00:54:13,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Lousy weather!

629
00:54:22,007 --> 00:54:24,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All my life I lived here,
on the mountain peak,

630
00:54:26,167 --> 00:54:27,646  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
amidst eternal frost,

631
00:54:29,327 --> 00:54:31,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
but I don't remember such
a hurricane.

632
00:54:33,167 --> 00:54:36,443  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's a good thing this
tavern was built strong.

633
00:54:37,447 --> 00:54:39,085  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Strong like a castle.

634
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:41,563  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Tavern called ''Emily''.

635
00:54:44,327 --> 00:54:45,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Emily...

636
00:54:48,527 --> 00:54:52,202  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She must be grey-haired
by now.

637
00:54:53,527 --> 00:54:54,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And probably happily
married.

638
00:54:57,007 --> 00:55:00,283  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But I still dream...

639
00:55:02,847 --> 00:55:04,724  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
of hearing her voice
one day.

640
00:55:13,087 --> 00:55:15,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Welcome, ladies and
gentlemen!

641
00:55:15,847 --> 00:55:18,645  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Please come in and make
yourselves comfortable!

642
00:55:19,687 --> 00:55:22,042  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sit by the fiire!

643
00:55:23,167 --> 00:55:25,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't cry, my lady.
I will help you.

644
00:55:25,887 --> 00:55:28,162  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There, hot wine is good
for you.

645
00:55:38,447 --> 00:55:40,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
May I know who you are?
Even though...

646
00:55:42,527 --> 00:55:47,601  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm used to travelers
not telling their names.

647
00:55:49,367 --> 00:55:51,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Nonsense! I'm a King.

648
00:55:52,327 --> 00:55:54,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Good evening, Your Majesty.

649
00:55:54,807 --> 00:55:56,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Good evening, innkeeper.

650
00:55:59,007 --> 00:56:00,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I am very unhappy.

651
00:56:01,927 --> 00:56:03,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That happens.

652
00:56:04,007 --> 00:56:05,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My daughter is gone.

653
00:56:06,247 --> 00:56:08,807  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Idiots. Spongers.

654
00:56:09,687 --> 00:56:12,281  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They left her unattended.

655
00:56:13,247 --> 00:56:16,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She fell in love,
they had a fight.

656
00:56:16,487 --> 00:56:18,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She put on men's clothes
and disappeared.

657
00:56:19,207 --> 00:56:21,004  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Spongers! Idlers!

658
00:56:21,847 --> 00:56:23,405  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who lives in this tavern?

659
00:56:23,767 --> 00:56:26,486  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A famous hunter and his
apprentices.

660
00:56:26,727 --> 00:56:29,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hunters? Maybe they saw
her?

661
00:56:29,447 --> 00:56:32,007  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They're hunting everywhere
around this place.

662
00:56:32,247 --> 00:56:34,886  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This hunter does not
hunt any more.

663
00:56:35,127 --> 00:56:38,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What does he do then?
- Certifies his skills.

664
00:56:38,287 --> 00:56:41,085  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He already got himself
50 diplomas, that prove

665
00:56:41,327 --> 00:56:42,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
that he is famous.

666
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:46,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What does he do in life?
- Nothing.

667
00:56:47,367 --> 00:56:51,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
To prove you're famous! That
can be a very tiresome business.

668
00:56:51,607 --> 00:56:52,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The hell with him!

669
00:56:52,847 --> 00:56:55,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You, awaiting death penalty!
We're off!

670
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:57,206  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Oh, my god!
- Take to the road!

671
00:56:57,847 --> 00:57:00,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
To go up into the mountains in
such weather! That's a killer.

672
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We have no choice.

673
00:57:02,407 --> 00:57:04,284  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There's the key to your room.

674
00:57:04,527 --> 00:57:07,041  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What will I do there?
- Do nothing.

675
00:57:07,287 --> 00:57:10,563  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And at sunrise we will set
off in search of her.

676
00:57:12,007 --> 00:57:14,567  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You will all get your keys.

677
00:57:15,687 --> 00:57:19,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Everyone should get their sleep
and prepare for tomorrow!

678
00:57:19,647 --> 00:57:22,400  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Follow me!

679
00:57:47,607 --> 00:57:49,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't be afraid, there's
no one here.

680
00:57:57,927 --> 00:58:01,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If those are the hunters,
I will kill you.

681
00:58:02,087 --> 00:58:06,683  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hunters everywhere!
I hate them!

682
00:58:06,927 --> 00:58:10,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Their wives start
discussing hunting!

683
00:58:10,647 --> 00:58:13,366  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Apprentice! Did you
deliver the letters?

684
00:58:13,607 --> 00:58:15,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I did. - To the Chief of the
Hunting Ground?

685
00:58:15,927 --> 00:58:19,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes, sir. And when I was coming
back I saw a fox's trails.

686
00:58:20,007 --> 00:58:23,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The hell with it!
That's a waste of time,

687
00:58:23,487 --> 00:58:25,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and meanwhile envious people are
masterminding a plot against me.

688
00:58:25,887 --> 00:58:29,482  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Maybe they're not?
- Sure they are.

689
00:58:32,367 --> 00:58:34,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Everyone's against me.

690
00:58:35,247 --> 00:58:38,683  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let them! Why don't we
shoot us some game!

691
00:58:38,927 --> 00:58:41,680  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let them do whatever they want,
we'll be the winners.

692
00:58:41,927 --> 00:58:43,201  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We'll be the good guys,

693
00:58:43,447 --> 00:58:45,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and they'll be the bad guys.

694
00:58:46,687 --> 00:58:47,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You fool!

695
00:58:48,327 --> 00:58:51,524  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They'll scrutinize my every
shot.

696
00:58:51,767 --> 00:58:53,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They'll say I shot the fox same
way as last year.

697
00:58:54,007 --> 00:58:56,202  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And that I didn't introduce any
innovations into hunting.

698
00:58:56,447 --> 00:58:58,085  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And what if I miss?

699
00:58:58,327 --> 00:59:01,125  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Me, who never missed
in his whole life.

700
00:59:01,367 --> 00:59:04,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You better not say anything,
or I'll kill you.

701
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:07,246  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Where's our new apprentice?
- He's cleaning his gun.

702
00:59:07,767 --> 00:59:08,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That a boy!

703
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:13,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You always praise every
new apprentice.

704
00:59:18,447 --> 00:59:20,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's the hunter!
Open up, you fool!

705
00:59:25,927 --> 00:59:29,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Is this a hotel? - The owner
will be with you in a minute.

706
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:31,086  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Are you a hunter?
- God forbid!

707
00:59:31,327 --> 00:59:33,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't like hunters.

708
00:59:33,847 --> 00:59:34,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Me too.

709
00:59:35,927 --> 00:59:38,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I hate them! Even though I'm
one myself. A famous hunter.

710
00:59:40,087 --> 00:59:41,122  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Too bad.

711
00:59:41,367 --> 00:59:43,927  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Not to mention small game,
in my lifetime,

712
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:47,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I shot 500 deer,
500 wild goats, 400 wolves,

713
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:50,006  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and 99 bears.

714
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:54,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Killing bears is no better
than killing children.

715
00:59:54,967 --> 00:59:55,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Did you see their claws?

716
00:59:55,927 --> 00:59:58,202  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They're shorter than a
hunter's dagger.

717
00:59:59,167 --> 01:00:03,001  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- They're so aggressive!
- Not if you don't tease them.

718
01:00:03,927 --> 01:00:06,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm so enraged, I'm speechless.

719
01:00:07,167 --> 01:00:08,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We will have to shoot.

720
01:00:08,807 --> 01:00:11,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My new apprentice!
Get my rifle!

721
01:00:12,327 --> 01:00:15,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I will kill you now.
- I don't care.

722
01:00:15,607 --> 01:00:16,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's get on with it then!

723
01:00:18,607 --> 01:00:21,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There, my new apprentice,
watch and learn.

724
01:00:21,687 --> 01:00:24,406  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now this boor and ignoramus
will be killed,

725
01:00:24,647 --> 01:00:27,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
for he knows nothing
about art.

726
01:00:29,847 --> 01:00:34,602  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Very well! But why don't you
eat these sausages fiirst.

727
01:00:36,167 --> 01:00:40,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I shall not eat when this
boor is staring at me.

728
01:00:40,487 --> 01:00:42,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Take these sausages to my
room,

729
01:00:43,207 --> 01:00:44,765  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and I will kill him after
dinner.

730
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I beg your pardon, do you
have a sister?

731
01:00:57,367 --> 01:01:00,962  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You remind me of I woman,
I have to forget.

732
01:01:03,007 --> 01:01:03,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where are you going?

733
01:01:05,927 --> 01:01:08,646  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't want to remind you of
something you need to forget.

734
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And this voice!

735
01:01:13,167 --> 01:01:14,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The voice is just like hers!

736
01:01:16,367 --> 01:01:17,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You must be hallucinating!

737
01:01:18,087 --> 01:01:20,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Perhaps. My vision is hazy.

738
01:01:22,447 --> 01:01:24,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I spent three days in
the saddle.

739
01:01:26,007 --> 01:01:29,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
When I was passing by this
tavern, my horse started crying.

740
01:01:29,887 --> 01:01:32,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What did you flee from,
like a criminal?

741
01:01:34,527 --> 01:01:39,282  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I fled from love.
- What a funny story!

742
01:01:39,687 --> 01:01:41,200  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Please don't laugh!

743
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:43,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There was something I found
out about this girl...

744
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:47,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And when she said
she would kiss me...

745
01:01:47,407 --> 01:01:49,602  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Foolish girl!
How stupid of her!

746
01:01:49,847 --> 01:01:52,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You don't dare say that!
- She deserves it!

747
01:01:54,607 --> 01:01:56,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Boaster and windbag!
- Who, me?

748
01:01:57,007 --> 01:02:00,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
To boast of his victories
in front of a stranger!

749
01:02:00,807 --> 01:02:03,526  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- She's a fool!
- Don't say that about her!

750
01:02:04,767 --> 01:02:05,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What did you say?
- She's a fool!

751
01:02:10,327 --> 01:02:12,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Impudent people ought
to be punished.

752
01:02:13,767 --> 01:02:16,406  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Defend yourself.
- I'm at your service.

753
01:03:42,327 --> 01:03:43,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Daddy!

754
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Princess!

755
01:04:04,687 --> 01:04:05,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It is you!

756
01:04:08,847 --> 01:04:10,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm so happy!

757
01:04:12,847 --> 01:04:14,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why are you here?

758
01:04:19,607 --> 01:04:21,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I followed you for 3 days.

759
01:04:22,367 --> 01:04:23,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes!

760
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:27,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
To tell you that I don't care
about you in the least!

761
01:04:29,087 --> 01:04:31,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I had no intention of
kissing you!

762
01:04:31,607 --> 01:04:33,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Or of falling in love
with you!

763
01:04:37,767 --> 01:04:41,362  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You hurt me so much,

764
01:04:44,367 --> 01:04:46,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
that I want revenge.

765
01:04:48,607 --> 01:04:50,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I will prove to you,
that I don't care.

766
01:04:52,367 --> 01:04:54,244  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll die but I'll prove it.

767
01:04:59,247 --> 01:05:00,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Run away...

768
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:07,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I have to run away!
Miserable bear!

769
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:10,559  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Run away, and save her
and myself!

770
01:05:12,687 --> 01:05:13,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Coward!

771
01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:18,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Coward!

772
01:05:31,367 --> 01:05:37,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How funny, how crazy,
How untimely,

773
01:05:37,847 --> 01:05:39,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And how wonderful!

774
01:05:39,767 --> 01:05:45,763  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Without any reason and
Without any meaning...

775
01:05:46,447 --> 01:05:48,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
At all!

776
01:05:58,447 --> 01:06:02,486  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There comes a day,
There strikes an hour,

777
01:06:02,927 --> 01:06:06,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There comes a moment,
There comes a time,

778
01:06:07,167 --> 01:06:11,160  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And the connection breaks,

779
01:06:11,607 --> 01:06:15,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Granite boils,
Ice catches fire,

780
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:19,806  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Light down knocks
You off your feet,

781
01:06:20,047 --> 01:06:24,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What madness!

782
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:28,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Weeds start to blossom,

783
01:06:28,687 --> 01:06:32,521  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The old owl sings like a
Nightingale,

784
01:06:32,767 --> 01:06:36,521  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And even the thinnest of
Threads...

785
01:06:36,967 --> 01:06:40,846  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Can not be cut in half

786
01:06:41,087 --> 01:06:44,284  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
By a steel dagger!

787
01:06:45,327 --> 01:06:49,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
By a steel dagger!

788
01:06:52,527 --> 01:06:58,523  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How funny, how crazy,
How untimely,

789
01:06:59,607 --> 01:07:01,643  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And how wonderful!

790
01:07:01,887 --> 01:07:07,883  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574

791

A USUAL WONDER
Part Two

810
01:09:15,914 --> 01:09:19,668  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Based on a play by Yevgenyi
SCHWARZ of the same name

811
01:09:29,834 --> 01:09:32,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There comes a day,
There strikes an hour,

812
01:09:32,954 --> 01:09:35,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There comes a moment,
There comes a time,

813
01:09:35,994 --> 01:09:38,428  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And the connection breaks,

814
01:09:39,034 --> 01:09:41,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Granite boils,
Ice catches fire,

815
01:09:42,194 --> 01:09:44,867  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Light down
Knocks you off your feet.

816
01:09:45,674 --> 01:09:47,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What madness!

817
01:09:48,354 --> 01:09:51,187  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Weeds start to blossom,

818
01:09:51,474 --> 01:09:54,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And old owl sings
Like a nightingale,

819
01:09:54,434 --> 01:09:57,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And even the thinnest of
Threads...

820
01:09:57,754 --> 01:10:00,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Can not be cut in two

821
01:10:00,434 --> 01:10:03,346  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
By a steel dagger!

822
01:10:03,594 --> 01:10:06,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
By a steel dagger!

823
01:10:09,354 --> 01:10:15,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How funny, how crazy,
How untimely,

824
01:10:15,674 --> 01:10:17,346  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And how wonderful!

825
01:10:17,674 --> 01:10:23,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Without any reason
Or meaning...

826
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:26,267  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
At all!

827
01:10:33,274 --> 01:10:36,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There comes a time,
And it brings...

828
01:10:36,554 --> 01:10:39,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Shivers and fear,
And a secret fever,

829
01:10:39,674 --> 01:10:43,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Power and delight,
Laughter and pain,

830
01:10:43,954 --> 01:10:45,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Light and shadow,

831
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:48,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And throws it all into
One big fire.

832
01:10:48,754 --> 01:10:51,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What madness!

833
01:10:51,834 --> 01:10:54,507  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And out of a mirage,
Out of nothing...

834
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:57,587  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Out of my own wild fantasies

835
01:10:57,834 --> 01:11:00,985  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Appears someone's face,

836
01:11:01,274 --> 01:11:03,868  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And it acquires shape
And color,

837
01:11:04,114 --> 01:11:06,947  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Flesh and passion,

838
01:11:07,194 --> 01:11:11,426  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Flesh and passion.

839
01:11:13,034 --> 01:11:18,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How funny, how crazy,
How untimely,

840
01:11:19,354 --> 01:11:21,106  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And how wonderful!

841
01:11:21,354 --> 01:11:27,065  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Without any reason
Or meaning...

842
01:11:27,754 --> 01:11:30,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
At all!

843
01:12:49,754 --> 01:12:51,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Have you been talking to
someone?

844
01:12:53,754 --> 01:12:54,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't know.

845
01:12:56,794 --> 01:12:57,783  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Maybe.

846
01:13:00,754 --> 01:13:03,222  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I know I'm not well.

847
01:13:04,914 --> 01:13:07,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Can I help?
- I doubt it.

848
01:13:08,594 --> 01:13:11,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Unlock the door, I'm leaving.
- That's impossible.

849
01:13:12,034 --> 01:13:13,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you hear how quiet
it is?

850
01:13:13,754 --> 01:13:16,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I tried to go out, but
I couldn't.

851
01:13:17,954 --> 01:13:19,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We're buried under the snow.

852
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:22,584  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I can't leave then?
- No.

853
01:13:22,834 --> 01:13:26,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Then lock me in.
I can't meet with her.

854
01:13:26,594 --> 01:13:27,822  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I love her.

855
01:13:28,754 --> 01:13:29,743  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The Princess?

856
01:13:34,354 --> 01:13:37,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- How did you know?
- I just asked.

857
01:13:39,354 --> 01:13:40,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Is she in this tavern?

858
01:13:41,674 --> 01:13:43,904  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes, disguised in a man's
outfit.

859
01:13:44,194 --> 01:13:47,584  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now I understand how she
insulted me.

860
01:13:47,834 --> 01:13:50,746  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Did you hear what she said?
- No, I haven't.

861
01:13:50,994 --> 01:13:53,428  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But I've lived a long life,
and I understand everything.

862
01:13:53,674 --> 01:13:56,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I won't say another word!

863
01:13:56,754 --> 01:14:00,224  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I thought I was talking to a
young man who looked like her.

864
01:14:00,474 --> 01:14:02,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That was a mean thing to do!

865
01:14:04,434 --> 01:14:07,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It is over now!

866
01:14:07,754 --> 01:14:09,585  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Lock me in.
- Here's the key.

867
01:14:10,514 --> 01:14:12,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I won't lock you in.

868
01:14:12,394 --> 01:14:15,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I wouldn't want you to
break my new lock.

869
01:14:17,434 --> 01:14:18,583  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Good night.

870
01:14:20,594 --> 01:14:21,583  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where will you fiind peace?

871
01:14:23,754 --> 01:14:25,267  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You won't.

872
01:14:28,114 --> 01:14:31,584  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Lock yourself in a monastery, -
solitude will remind you of her.

873
01:14:33,754 --> 01:14:35,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Set up a tavern by the
road, -

874
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:40,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
every knock at the door will
remind you of her.

875
01:14:43,594 --> 01:14:47,143  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Damn! The candle keeps
blowing out.

876
01:14:50,954 --> 01:14:52,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well of course it is.

877
01:14:53,354 --> 01:14:54,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I was thinking of you.

878
01:14:58,514 --> 01:14:59,742  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Emily...

879
01:15:06,354 --> 01:15:07,582  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well I'll be damned!

880
01:15:20,114 --> 01:15:21,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you recognize me?

881
01:15:23,114 --> 01:15:24,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Emil?

882
01:15:28,594 --> 01:15:29,583  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes.

883
01:15:33,834 --> 01:15:38,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That was the name of a young man
whom a very mean girl forced to

884
01:15:38,674 --> 01:15:40,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
flee to no-man's land.

885
01:15:40,914 --> 01:15:43,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't look at me like that.

886
01:15:43,274 --> 01:15:46,107  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My face is wind-beaten.

887
01:15:46,674 --> 01:15:49,586  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I see you like you were
20 years ago.

888
01:15:49,834 --> 01:15:52,348  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I forgot how to cry.
I became mean and callous.

889
01:15:52,594 --> 01:15:56,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I smoke sailors' tobacco,
devilish stuff.

890
01:15:57,194 --> 01:15:59,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's what became of me.

891
01:15:59,754 --> 01:16:02,427  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You were always like that.

892
01:16:02,674 --> 01:16:05,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Stubborn and proud by nature.

893
01:16:06,754 --> 01:16:09,143  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's just a new form it
acquired, that's all.

894
01:16:09,754 --> 01:16:11,187  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's the whole difference.

895
01:16:11,434 --> 01:16:12,583  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Damn!

896
01:16:13,114 --> 01:16:16,584  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
At every crowded
masquerade...

897
01:16:17,674 --> 01:16:21,986  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I would recognize you
under any mask.

898
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:25,103  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You remember?

899
01:16:28,954 --> 01:16:30,103  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes.

900
01:16:53,274 --> 01:16:58,268  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My lady, don't you think

901
01:16:58,514 --> 01:17:02,826  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The weather is better
Than ever?

902
01:17:03,514 --> 01:17:07,587  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I will answer, my lord...

903
01:17:08,434 --> 01:17:13,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I do find...

904
01:17:13,514 --> 01:17:19,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That the weather is quite
Unusual indeed.

905
01:17:23,954 --> 01:17:28,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My lady, why is it...

906
01:17:29,194 --> 01:17:33,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That this evening is so
Extraordinary wonderful?

907
01:17:33,954 --> 01:17:38,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My lord, perhaps...

908
01:17:38,994 --> 01:17:43,624  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It is not easy to explain,

909
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:49,984  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But it is probably because
You are with me tonight.

910
01:18:03,274 --> 01:18:08,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh, my lady,
When we are together,

911
01:18:08,514 --> 01:18:13,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All the flowers blossom
In the meadows,

912
01:18:13,594 --> 01:18:18,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I will say this, my lord...

913
01:18:18,354 --> 01:18:22,745  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It is time for me to go,

914
01:18:23,034 --> 01:18:29,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But I can't hurt the feelings
Of the little flowers.

915
01:18:30,914 --> 01:18:35,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I fiind it pleasing and
Amusing,

916
01:18:35,954 --> 01:18:39,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That you like me,

917
01:18:40,434 --> 01:18:45,064  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And I like you even more.

918
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:49,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That is wonderful!
Ding-ding-dong!

919
01:19:11,834 --> 01:19:16,305  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And this is just a mask
time has put on you.

920
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:22,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why? Oh, why?

921
01:19:25,674 --> 01:19:28,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why were you mad at him
then?

922
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:31,984  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Why?
- You kissed him.

923
01:19:34,354 --> 01:19:36,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He passed away long ago.

924
01:19:39,034 --> 01:19:42,424  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But why did you kiss him?

925
01:19:44,274 --> 01:19:45,866  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Only to avenge you.

926
01:19:46,954 --> 01:19:49,184  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You danced with the general's
daughter.

927
01:19:50,274 --> 01:19:53,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Dancing is not a sin.
- No.

928
01:19:54,754 --> 01:19:56,745  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You were whispering something
in her ear.

929
01:19:57,034 --> 01:20:00,344  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I was whispering:
one, two, three...

930
01:20:01,434 --> 01:20:03,664  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She couldn't follow the
rhythm.

931
01:20:08,194 --> 01:20:10,264  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Funny.
- So funny I want to cry.

932
01:20:13,194 --> 01:20:17,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Can you forgive my wicked self
for kissing him?

933
01:20:18,354 --> 01:20:20,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I am so happy to see you.

934
01:20:22,034 --> 01:20:23,183  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How stupid.

935
01:20:24,514 --> 01:20:26,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I forgot how to cry.

936
01:20:26,834 --> 01:20:29,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's talk about something
else.

937
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:32,025  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There is one important
matter.

938
01:20:32,274 --> 01:20:34,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There are two young people
in this house,

939
01:20:34,914 --> 01:20:38,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
who will die if we don't
do something.

940
01:20:38,754 --> 01:20:43,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The Princess and the young man,
because of whom she ran away.

941
01:20:43,514 --> 01:20:46,506  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- They met?
- And had a fiight.

942
01:20:47,274 --> 01:20:48,946  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hit the drums!

943
01:20:50,594 --> 01:20:53,062  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Blow the pipes!
- What pipes?

944
01:20:53,674 --> 01:20:56,268  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't pay attention, it's just
a court habit.

945
01:20:56,514 --> 01:20:58,425  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Get your swords out!
Prepare for battle!

946
01:20:59,194 --> 01:21:00,263  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Get up and going!

947
01:21:01,594 --> 01:21:02,743  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I get it.

948
01:21:03,754 --> 01:21:07,144  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Emily was married to the
palace commandant.

949
01:21:08,954 --> 01:21:10,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hit the drums!

950
01:21:18,034 --> 01:21:19,183  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Get up and going!

951
01:21:31,274 --> 01:21:34,425  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He didn't know who
he was married to!

952
01:21:34,674 --> 01:21:36,505  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
May his soul rest in peace.

953
01:21:37,514 --> 01:21:38,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Did you see her?
- Yes.

954
01:21:39,074 --> 01:21:41,065  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She must be pale and weak?

955
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:43,544  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She's tanned and running around
dressed like a boy.

956
01:21:45,034 --> 01:21:46,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Is he here?
- Yes.

957
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:48,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Still in love?
- Very much so.

958
01:21:49,034 --> 01:21:51,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Hurting?
- Indeed!

959
01:21:51,834 --> 01:21:54,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He deserves it, the bastard!

960
01:21:54,354 --> 01:21:57,266  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Heart drops, fast!

961
01:21:58,034 --> 01:21:59,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My apprentice is not
feeling well.

962
01:22:02,194 --> 01:22:05,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Give me those drops! Quick!

963
01:22:07,274 --> 01:22:09,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- He's not feeling well.
- This one?

964
01:22:10,034 --> 01:22:12,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh really! He won't notice
it if I die.

965
01:22:12,954 --> 01:22:16,105  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The new one! He won't eat, won't
drink and won't answer questions.

966
01:22:17,754 --> 01:22:19,107  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It is my daughter!

967
01:22:19,394 --> 01:22:21,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh my god!

968
01:22:22,954 --> 01:22:24,626  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Who is your daughter?
- The new apprentice.

969
01:22:24,874 --> 01:22:28,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- It's the Princess in disguise.
- Well I'll be damned!

970
01:22:28,514 --> 01:22:30,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I almost hit her.

971
01:22:30,554 --> 01:22:33,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Can't you tell a boy
from a girl?

972
01:22:33,514 --> 01:22:34,742  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- And what about you?
- What?

973
01:22:34,994 --> 01:22:37,144  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All right, enough of that.

974
01:22:38,834 --> 01:22:40,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where's the Princess?

975
01:22:41,914 --> 01:22:44,826  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey you! Don't shout at me!

976
01:22:45,354 --> 01:22:47,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My job puts me under
great pressure.

977
01:22:47,914 --> 01:22:49,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't like being shouted at.

978
01:22:49,474 --> 01:22:52,705  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If you want to show me my
mistakes, compliment me first.

979
01:22:52,954 --> 01:22:53,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Scoundrel!

980
01:22:54,274 --> 01:22:55,263  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's a King.

981
01:22:55,514 --> 01:22:58,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

982
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:00,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll forgive you later.

983
01:23:06,594 --> 01:23:07,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where's the Princess?

984
01:23:08,914 --> 01:23:12,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sitting at the fiireplace,
looking at burning coals.

985
01:23:12,674 --> 01:23:13,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Take me to her.

986
01:23:14,234 --> 01:23:16,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I always remember your stories
about hunting.

987
01:23:17,194 --> 01:23:18,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Please be careful!

988
01:23:18,834 --> 01:23:21,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You have to take of yourself
for our sake!

989
01:23:22,754 --> 01:23:27,145  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We love you so much'
Your Majesty!

990
01:23:29,954 --> 01:23:32,024  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She'll open fiire.

991
01:23:32,954 --> 01:23:35,787  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The Princess said she will
shoot anyone, who...

992
01:23:36,034 --> 01:23:38,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She won't shoot her own
father.

993
01:23:38,914 --> 01:23:39,903  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't think so.

994
01:23:40,154 --> 01:23:42,987  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I doubt it she will spare
even her own father.

995
01:23:47,594 --> 01:23:49,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now he will shout at me
again.

996
01:23:52,754 --> 01:23:54,824  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Jesus, my throat is sore!

997
01:23:55,434 --> 01:23:57,664  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There's no job more hazardous
than the job of a courtier.

998
01:23:57,954 --> 01:23:58,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How true.

999
01:24:04,514 --> 01:24:05,947  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I am in terrible anguish!

1000
01:24:07,194 --> 01:24:08,866  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I warn everyone.

1001
01:24:10,114 --> 01:24:12,582  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She is sitting there, all
sad and miserable.

1002
01:24:12,834 --> 01:24:14,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There is no way I can
help her.

1003
01:24:15,674 --> 01:24:16,743  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's how it is.

1004
01:24:17,674 --> 01:24:20,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who will dare to approach her,
talk to her,

1005
01:24:21,274 --> 01:24:23,469  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
console and comfort her?

1006
01:24:24,594 --> 01:24:25,583  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who?

1007
01:24:26,034 --> 01:24:30,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- She will open fiire.
- That's for sure.

1008
01:24:30,754 --> 01:24:33,985  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So what?! You've been sentenced
to death anyway.

1009
01:24:34,754 --> 01:24:37,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Who will go first?
- Allow me.

1010
01:24:38,034 --> 01:24:39,023  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That a boy!

1011
01:24:39,514 --> 01:24:40,503  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, you can't!

1012
01:24:41,514 --> 01:24:44,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's better if one of her close
ones went there.

1013
01:24:44,474 --> 01:24:47,227  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
For one who is in love the
closest seem the most distant.

1014
01:24:47,474 --> 01:24:50,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The world has changed, but
they are still the same.

1015
01:24:50,914 --> 01:24:52,267  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Gee, I haven't thought
about that.

1016
01:24:52,514 --> 01:24:56,507  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But I will not cancel my order,
because I am a stubborn tyrant.

1017
01:24:56,754 --> 01:24:59,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I feel the genes of my aunt
awakening in me now.

1018
01:25:00,154 --> 01:25:02,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She was a hopeless fool.

1019
01:25:02,674 --> 01:25:04,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Give me a hat and a
scrap of paper.

1020
01:25:05,954 --> 01:25:07,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We shall draw lots.

1021
01:25:18,914 --> 01:25:20,142  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
we shall draw lots.

1022
01:25:23,514 --> 01:25:24,503  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Ready.

1023
01:25:26,354 --> 01:25:30,745  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Whoever draws the one with the
cross, goes to the Princess.

1024
01:25:31,354 --> 01:25:33,345  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She is armed.

1025
01:25:33,594 --> 01:25:36,062  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let me talk to the Princess.

1026
01:25:36,314 --> 01:25:39,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I know what to tell her.
- My answer is ''no''.

1027
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:41,425  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm having one of my fiits
of stubbornness.

1028
01:25:43,674 --> 01:25:47,223  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Am I a King or not?

1029
01:25:48,594 --> 01:25:50,903  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
First Minister, you draw fiirst.

1030
01:25:55,034 --> 01:25:56,945  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Alas!
- Thank god!

1031
01:26:01,034 --> 01:26:02,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There's no cross here.

1032
01:26:03,754 --> 01:26:06,222  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why did you say ''alas'',
you idiot?

1033
01:26:07,434 --> 01:26:08,423  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Quiet!

1034
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:12,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Your turn, my lady.

1035
01:26:14,034 --> 01:26:16,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I have to go!
- Congratulations!

1036
01:26:17,354 --> 01:26:19,265  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And may your soul rest
in peace.

1037
01:26:20,834 --> 01:26:22,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Show me that paper.

1038
01:26:25,754 --> 01:26:28,063  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You liar!

1039
01:26:28,514 --> 01:26:29,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Look at these people!

1040
01:26:30,594 --> 01:26:34,223  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All they know is how to
cheat on their King.

1041
01:26:35,514 --> 01:26:36,503  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Next!

1042
01:26:37,034 --> 01:26:39,264  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Next!
- What are you shouting for?

1043
01:26:39,514 --> 01:26:42,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Draw the lot!

1044
01:26:44,434 --> 01:26:46,902  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

1045
01:26:47,754 --> 01:26:50,063  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Open your eyes,
the hat is right here.

1046
01:26:55,194 --> 01:26:58,425  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Alas, no cross.
How unfortunate!

1047
01:26:58,674 --> 01:27:01,142  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Next!
- Come on, show me that.

1048
01:27:01,794 --> 01:27:04,024  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What?
- Give me that scrap of paper.

1049
01:27:06,834 --> 01:27:08,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- No cross?
- No.

1050
01:27:11,034 --> 01:27:13,867  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What's this then?
- You call that a cross?

1051
01:27:14,114 --> 01:27:18,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Nonsense! This is not a cross?
This looks more like an ''X''.

1052
01:27:18,594 --> 01:27:22,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, this is not an ''X'',
it is your lot.

1053
01:27:23,674 --> 01:27:24,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Go ahead.

1054
01:27:25,194 --> 01:27:26,422  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Your Majesty!

1055
01:27:27,674 --> 01:27:30,984  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Be reasonable. What do you want
me to risk my life for?

1056
01:27:31,834 --> 01:27:35,543  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
For a whim, for some kind of
a stupid prejudice?

1057
01:27:36,274 --> 01:27:37,423  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
For love!

1058
01:27:38,114 --> 01:27:40,503  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What love?
Did you see it?

1059
01:27:40,754 --> 01:27:43,063  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't be selfish and
don't keep us waiting.

1060
01:27:43,314 --> 01:27:47,307  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
When a smuggler crosses a
canyon clinging to a perch,

1061
01:27:47,554 --> 01:27:51,024  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
or a merchant sails across the
ocean in a frail boat,

1062
01:27:51,274 --> 01:27:53,947  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
that is understandable,
that is noble.

1063
01:27:54,194 --> 01:27:56,264  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
These people are making money.

1064
01:27:57,194 --> 01:28:00,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But what's there for me
in this?

1065
01:28:01,354 --> 01:28:04,266  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What you call love, my lady,

1066
01:28:04,514 --> 01:28:07,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
can be a lot of fun and
a little absurd.

1067
01:28:08,034 --> 01:28:11,026  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- But to risk my life!
- Shut up, you despicable fool!

1068
01:28:11,274 --> 01:28:13,265  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Tell her not to abuse
me.

1069
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:15,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What are you staring at me!

1070
01:28:15,874 --> 01:28:18,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
As if you really believe
what you're saying.

1071
01:28:18,834 --> 01:28:21,826  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've seen enough of
noble sufferers,

1072
01:28:22,074 --> 01:28:23,746  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and the torturers of
human souls.

1073
01:28:23,994 --> 01:28:28,067  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They push the deceived fools
to their sure death.

1074
01:28:28,514 --> 01:28:30,266  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It is them who invented
love!

1075
01:28:33,914 --> 01:28:36,667  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There is no such thing as
love, Your Majesty!

1076
01:28:38,194 --> 01:28:42,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Trust the word of an
experienced man.

1077
01:28:44,034 --> 01:28:47,583  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All right, you said your
fiinal word.

1078
01:28:47,834 --> 01:28:50,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now go. Don't expect me
to pardon you.

1079
01:28:50,634 --> 01:28:52,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Go, or I'll shoot you myself.

1080
01:29:00,194 --> 01:29:01,422  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why did I listen to him!

1081
01:29:02,674 --> 01:29:04,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now he awakened the aunt
in me.

1082
01:29:05,154 --> 01:29:07,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The one who could be easily
convinced by anyone.

1083
01:29:08,674 --> 01:29:10,744  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The poor thing was married
18 times,

1084
01:29:10,994 --> 01:29:13,508  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
not to mention fleeting
affairs.

1085
01:29:14,954 --> 01:29:16,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Maybe love doesn't exist
after all?

1086
01:29:17,354 --> 01:29:20,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Maybe the Princess is suffering
from a case of severe angina?

1087
01:29:21,514 --> 01:29:23,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Your Majesty.
- Shut up!

1088
01:29:26,114 --> 01:29:28,423  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You are an honorable and
devout woman.

1089
01:29:28,674 --> 01:29:30,187  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let us listen to the
young.

1090
01:29:31,434 --> 01:29:32,423  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You...

1091
01:29:33,274 --> 01:29:34,502  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Beat it.

1092
01:29:34,754 --> 01:29:36,028  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
For good.

1093
01:29:39,194 --> 01:29:41,105  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
May his soul rest in peace.

1094
01:29:41,434 --> 01:29:45,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- She may have missed!
- Never! She's my student!

1095
01:29:47,274 --> 01:29:49,742  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Quiet! I personally am happy.

1096
01:29:50,114 --> 01:29:53,265  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My daughter behaves
like all normal people.

1097
01:29:53,514 --> 01:29:56,586  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She's feeling low, and
she starts shooting around.

1098
01:30:06,194 --> 01:30:07,866  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She missed!

1099
01:30:08,594 --> 01:30:12,303  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Why are you still alive?
- Because I fired that shot.

1100
01:30:12,594 --> 01:30:14,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's right.

1101
01:30:14,754 --> 01:30:17,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Who at?
- At the Princess.

1102
01:30:17,754 --> 01:30:20,143  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh, she's alive, don't worry.

1103
01:30:22,194 --> 01:30:25,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey you! Get me an executioner's
block and a shot of Vodka.

1104
01:30:25,434 --> 01:30:27,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Vodka for me, the rest for him!
Move it!

1105
01:30:28,074 --> 01:30:29,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Not so fast.

1106
01:30:30,954 --> 01:30:32,785  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Listen here, father.

1107
01:30:37,514 --> 01:30:40,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The princess is my
fiiance.

1108
01:30:48,514 --> 01:30:49,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's crazy.

1109
01:30:49,794 --> 01:30:50,783  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Not in the least!

1110
01:30:51,194 --> 01:30:53,264  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Tell me everything,
or I'll kill you!

1111
01:30:53,514 --> 01:30:55,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I like to tell about
deals,

1112
01:30:55,714 --> 01:30:57,306  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
that worked out fine.

1113
01:30:57,754 --> 01:31:01,224  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I go there, I open the door
And wait to be shot at.

1114
01:31:01,514 --> 01:31:04,904  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't want to die,
just like anyone else.

1115
01:31:05,594 --> 01:31:07,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So I stand there,

1116
01:31:08,194 --> 01:31:10,662  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I stand and I think,

1117
01:31:10,914 --> 01:31:15,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I think something like that:
Now is my hour of death.

1118
01:31:15,674 --> 01:31:20,702  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And life is so good,
Oh, so good,

1119
01:31:20,954 --> 01:31:25,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And I don't want to die,
Just like anyone else.

1120
01:31:28,034 --> 01:31:30,787  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The girl jumps up,
She rushes to the door,

1121
01:31:31,274 --> 01:31:32,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I grab at my gun,

1122
01:31:33,514 --> 01:31:35,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And I fire a shot at her.

1123
01:31:36,154 --> 01:31:37,587  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What was I to do?

1124
01:31:37,834 --> 01:31:42,783  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I fiire at her,
At the sweet little lady,

1125
01:31:43,194 --> 01:31:47,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Because of the circumstances,
Not out of spite.

1126
01:31:48,514 --> 01:31:53,144  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She didn't shake,
She didn't shiver,

1127
01:31:53,594 --> 01:31:57,906  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But instead she said
In her gentle voice...

1128
01:31:58,954 --> 01:32:02,264  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I said to myself that I will
Marry anyone who comes fiirst,

1129
01:32:02,514 --> 01:32:05,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't really care who.

1130
01:32:06,274 --> 01:32:08,868  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So you have come fiirst,
She said.

1131
01:32:10,754 --> 01:32:15,782  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes, that's what she said
To me, the sweet girl.

1132
01:32:16,034 --> 01:32:20,425  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You are the fiirst one I see,
And I am yours forever.

1133
01:32:21,194 --> 01:32:26,222  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And in the midst of
All that fire and smoke

1134
01:32:26,674 --> 01:32:30,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I planted a kiss on her
tender lips.

1135
01:32:33,594 --> 01:32:36,506  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Please stop, or I will
kill you.

1136
01:32:36,754 --> 01:32:39,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No problem! They already
tried to kill me today.

1137
01:32:39,434 --> 01:32:41,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- And look what happened!
- One hell of a mess!

1138
01:32:45,754 --> 01:32:48,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Look for some medicine
in the fiirst aid kit.

1139
01:32:49,194 --> 01:32:52,345  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I nearly fainted, and all I
got left is feelings.

1140
01:32:52,594 --> 01:32:54,744  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Delicate, fragile,
feelings I can't explain.

1141
01:32:55,834 --> 01:32:59,907  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Is it music or flowers I
want, or to stab someone?

1142
01:33:00,154 --> 01:33:02,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I know, something strange
has happened to me.

1143
01:33:03,114 --> 01:33:06,504  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And I'm afraid to face reality.

1144
01:33:10,194 --> 01:33:11,183  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Daddy!

1145
01:33:12,954 --> 01:33:15,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Good evening, daddy.
- Good evening.

1146
01:33:16,034 --> 01:33:17,387  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm getting married.

1147
01:33:19,674 --> 01:33:21,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who to, my child?

1148
01:33:22,674 --> 01:33:24,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
To this one.

1149
01:33:24,834 --> 01:33:27,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Give me your hand.
- With great pleasure.

1150
01:33:28,114 --> 01:33:30,344  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't play the fool, or I'll
shoot you.

1151
01:33:30,594 --> 01:33:32,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're OK!
I'm proud of you!

1152
01:33:32,954 --> 01:33:35,104  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The wedding is to take
place right now.

1153
01:33:35,354 --> 01:33:37,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A wedding is always a
happy occasion.

1154
01:33:37,914 --> 01:33:40,428  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why postpone it!

1155
01:33:40,834 --> 01:33:41,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My sword!

1156
01:33:43,514 --> 01:33:46,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I ask you to be my wife.

1157
01:33:46,834 --> 01:33:49,428  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I am young and healthy.
And I will make you happy.

1158
01:33:49,674 --> 01:33:50,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What is this?

1159
01:33:51,274 --> 01:33:53,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Will you marry me?
- Don't answer him.

1160
01:33:55,354 --> 01:33:57,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You can do this,
and I can't?

1161
01:33:58,674 --> 01:34:01,984  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I swore to marry the
fiirst person that comes by.

1162
01:34:02,234 --> 01:34:03,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Me too!
- I don't care.

1163
01:34:04,434 --> 01:34:07,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Ladies! You will help me
put on my wedding gown.

1164
01:34:08,114 --> 01:34:12,187  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Gentlemen! You will help
me set the table.

1165
01:34:13,834 --> 01:34:17,543  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Think of a pretext and make
the Princess come back.

1166
01:34:18,034 --> 01:34:20,343  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I will bring her back by
force if I have to!

1167
01:34:21,674 --> 01:34:23,983  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I ask you to marry me.

1168
01:34:24,234 --> 01:34:26,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Which one of us are you
proposing to? There's two of us.

1169
01:34:27,514 --> 01:34:29,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sorry, I haven't noticed.

1170
01:34:29,314 --> 01:34:32,465  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
To come near two people in love
when they're fiighting

1171
01:34:32,714 --> 01:34:34,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
can be lethally dangerous.

1172
01:34:34,434 --> 01:34:37,506  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Have pity on the girl!
- Does anyone have pity on me?

1173
01:34:37,754 --> 01:34:40,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A couple of kind gentle
words,

1174
01:34:40,554 --> 01:34:42,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and you will both be happy!

1175
01:34:42,754 --> 01:34:45,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Tell her you were wrong
and kiss her.

1176
01:34:46,114 --> 01:34:47,627  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Don't be stubborn.
- No!

1177
01:34:48,354 --> 01:34:50,185  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't waste time!

1178
01:34:51,274 --> 01:34:54,505  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I hear Emily's footsteps.
She's bringing the Princess.

1179
01:35:18,674 --> 01:35:19,902  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Ladies and gentlemen!

1180
01:35:20,154 --> 01:35:22,622  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Please accept my congratulations
on this happy occasion!

1181
01:35:22,874 --> 01:35:25,946  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The wedding of the Princess
and the Minister

1182
01:35:26,194 --> 01:35:27,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
will take place right now.

1183
01:35:29,034 --> 01:35:30,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Emily, what are you
saying?

1184
01:35:33,594 --> 01:35:37,382  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's an order!

1185
01:35:39,674 --> 01:35:41,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What's gotten into you,
Emily?

1186
01:35:43,114 --> 01:35:44,342  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't touch me!

1187
01:35:49,834 --> 01:35:50,983  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What's with me?

1188
01:35:51,954 --> 01:35:53,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What's with you, Emily?
- Don't touch me!

1189
01:35:53,994 --> 01:35:56,986  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm on duty! I'm doing my job.

1190
01:35:58,674 --> 01:35:59,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What's gotten into me?

1191
01:36:02,434 --> 01:36:05,426  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm only doing my job!

1192
01:36:06,674 --> 01:36:07,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
God damn me!

1193
01:36:09,434 --> 01:36:11,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Everything's ready,
Your Majesty.

1194
01:36:35,954 --> 01:36:37,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
As honorary Saint,

1195
01:36:39,114 --> 01:36:40,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
honorary Martyr,

1196
01:36:43,114 --> 01:36:47,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and honorary Pope of our
kingdom

1197
01:36:49,274 --> 01:36:52,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I take it upon myself to
perform this pleasant duty.

1198
01:36:53,874 --> 01:36:55,023  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I ask the bride and groom

1199
01:36:55,674 --> 01:36:57,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
to join hands.

1200
01:36:57,474 --> 01:36:58,463  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No!

1201
01:36:58,794 --> 01:37:02,503  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What do you mean, ''no''?
Go ahead, say it.

1202
01:37:02,754 --> 01:37:05,746  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Leave us alone, I have to
talk to the Princess.

1203
01:37:05,994 --> 01:37:06,983  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The impudent young man!

1204
01:37:07,594 --> 01:37:09,107  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Boor!

1205
01:37:10,674 --> 01:37:12,426  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What a boor!

1206
01:37:13,954 --> 01:37:15,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Look at that boor!

1207
01:37:17,194 --> 01:37:19,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Please leave, everyone.

1208
01:37:20,434 --> 01:37:22,743  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And leave us alone.

1209
01:37:22,994 --> 01:37:25,906  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I think we should go.

1210
01:37:26,354 --> 01:37:28,345  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I would leave,

1211
01:37:28,594 --> 01:37:31,984  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
but I'm dying to know what
he will say to her.

1212
01:37:32,234 --> 01:37:35,385  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Please, let's do what
the young man asks.

1213
01:37:36,274 --> 01:37:38,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We can do that,

1214
01:37:39,514 --> 01:37:42,984  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
the more so that we can
eavesdrop through the keyhole.

1215
01:37:43,594 --> 01:37:44,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's go, gentlemen!

1216
01:37:56,434 --> 01:37:58,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I will tell you the truth.

1217
01:38:00,514 --> 01:38:02,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Our encounter brought
us disaster.

1218
01:38:03,274 --> 01:38:04,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We shouldn't have fallen
in love.

1219
01:38:07,834 --> 01:38:08,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It is terrible.

1220
01:38:14,954 --> 01:38:16,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We fell in love.

1221
01:38:21,434 --> 01:38:22,583  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We fell in love...

1222
01:38:25,754 --> 01:38:27,745  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We fell in love with
each other.

1223
01:38:33,354 --> 01:38:36,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If you kiss me, I will
turn into a beast.

1224
01:38:39,354 --> 01:38:41,026  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I will turn into a beast.

1225
01:38:58,914 --> 01:39:00,905  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If I kiss you...

1226
01:39:01,754 --> 01:39:03,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I will turn into a bear.

1227
01:39:04,434 --> 01:39:07,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- A bear?
- Yes, and I don't want that.

1228
01:39:12,954 --> 01:39:15,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I couldn't bare it.

1229
01:39:34,194 --> 01:39:38,984  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I swore that sooner I'd
die than hurt you.

1230
01:39:54,034 --> 01:39:55,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Forgive me.

1231
01:39:57,754 --> 01:40:01,064  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- The moment I kiss you?
- Yes.

1232
01:40:03,434 --> 01:40:06,506  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And you will walk around
the room in silence,

1233
01:40:07,754 --> 01:40:09,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
like in a cage?

1234
01:40:10,034 --> 01:40:11,023  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes.

1235
01:40:14,834 --> 01:40:18,224  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And you will never talk
to me in a human voice?

1236
01:40:18,474 --> 01:40:19,463  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No.

1237
01:40:24,514 --> 01:40:26,903  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How terrible that this
should end in this way!

1238
01:40:33,274 --> 01:40:34,263  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Father!

1239
01:40:35,954 --> 01:40:36,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Father!

1240
01:40:39,954 --> 01:40:44,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Father, he...
- I know.

1241
01:40:44,954 --> 01:40:47,263  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I was eavesdropping, daughter.

1242
01:40:48,354 --> 01:40:49,503  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How terrible!

1243
01:40:49,754 --> 01:40:51,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's leave, father.

1244
01:40:51,394 --> 01:40:54,909  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Something's happening inside me,
something frightening and kind.

1245
01:40:55,434 --> 01:40:56,583  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's scary!

1246
01:40:57,594 --> 01:41:01,587  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Maybe we shouldn't send him
away? Look at how others live.

1247
01:41:01,834 --> 01:41:05,144  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
After all, he's a bear,
not a ferret.

1248
01:41:07,354 --> 01:41:11,063  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We could tame him,
brush his hair.

1249
01:41:11,354 --> 01:41:13,424  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He could dance for us
once in a while.

1250
01:41:13,674 --> 01:41:16,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No! I love him too much
for that.

1251
01:41:19,274 --> 01:41:20,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Good-bye forever.

1252
01:41:34,274 --> 01:41:35,423  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Forever.

1253
01:41:43,114 --> 01:41:46,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's say good-bye
In a soft voice,

1254
01:41:46,674 --> 01:41:49,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Say good-bye in a low
Voice,

1255
01:41:50,434 --> 01:41:54,825  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Say good-bye with a light
Heart.

1256
01:41:57,594 --> 01:42:00,506  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A week or two,

1257
01:42:01,114 --> 01:42:04,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And it we'll get over it.

1258
01:42:04,674 --> 01:42:09,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Everything will remain
In the past.

1259
01:42:11,914 --> 01:42:14,826  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Even though it is sad!

1260
01:42:15,434 --> 01:42:18,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It is senseless and
Meaningless!

1261
01:42:19,114 --> 01:42:24,586  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh, how good it would be to
Start all over again!

1262
01:42:26,434 --> 01:42:32,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But that is impossible,
That is unthinkable,

1263
01:42:33,514 --> 01:42:37,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't even dream of it,
Forget it.

1264
01:42:40,674 --> 01:42:43,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's go back to our lunches,

1265
01:42:44,114 --> 01:42:47,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Back to our clothes.

1266
01:42:47,914 --> 01:42:52,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Fill our days with little
careS.

1267
01:42:54,914 --> 01:42:58,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It is easier that way,

1268
01:42:58,434 --> 01:43:01,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It is much more simple,
Isn't it?

1269
01:43:02,194 --> 01:43:06,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And it hurts less,
Isn't it?

1270
01:43:09,034 --> 01:43:12,106  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's not invent ways,

1271
01:43:12,354 --> 01:43:15,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's not count on our destiny,

1272
01:43:16,354 --> 01:43:20,905  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's not worth the effort,
Believe me.

1273
01:43:23,434 --> 01:43:26,267  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's true, gentlemen.

1274
01:43:26,994 --> 01:43:30,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Not ever, not in your dreams.

1275
01:43:30,834 --> 01:43:35,828  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It will never be.

1276
01:43:38,194 --> 01:43:41,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh, how charming,

1277
01:43:41,954 --> 01:43:44,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh, how good it was,

1278
01:43:45,274 --> 01:43:48,346  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It was, and it is no more.

1279
01:43:49,114 --> 01:43:51,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It was, and it is no more.

1280
01:43:59,434 --> 01:44:03,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I brought them to this hotel,

1281
01:44:05,834 --> 01:44:09,065  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Heaped up all entrances
and exits with snow.

1282
01:44:11,354 --> 01:44:13,868  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I was so proud of my
resourcefulness.

1283
01:44:15,834 --> 01:44:19,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And you didn't kiss her.

1284
01:44:27,194 --> 01:44:31,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Ladies and gentlemen,
the hotel is closing down.

1285
01:44:33,194 --> 01:44:34,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm leaving.

1286
01:44:37,514 --> 01:44:39,982  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The keys! I'll lock the place
myself.

1287
01:44:41,274 --> 01:44:45,187  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Go tell the hunter to hurry.
He's packing his diplomas.

1288
01:44:54,194 --> 01:44:57,266  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How dared you not to
kiss the girl?

1289
01:44:59,954 --> 01:45:01,023  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How could you do that?

1290
01:45:02,354 --> 01:45:04,345  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know what that would
lead to.

1291
01:45:04,594 --> 01:45:06,824  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't! You don't love her.

1292
01:45:07,514 --> 01:45:08,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's not true!

1293
01:45:12,114 --> 01:45:13,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You don't love her,

1294
01:45:14,514 --> 01:45:17,586  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
otherwise the power of passion
would have taken over!

1295
01:45:18,114 --> 01:45:19,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who can tell what will
happen,

1296
01:45:20,154 --> 01:45:23,146  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
when someone is seized with
strong noble emotions?

1297
01:45:23,394 --> 01:45:27,182  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Poor unarmed people
overthrow kings!

1298
01:45:27,434 --> 01:45:28,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Out of love for their
fellow brothers.

1299
01:45:29,074 --> 01:45:33,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Out of love for their nation
soldiers defy death.

1300
01:45:33,434 --> 01:45:36,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Men of wisdom rise to the sky
and plunge into hell.

1301
01:45:38,034 --> 01:45:39,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Out of love for Truth.

1302
01:45:40,954 --> 01:45:45,027  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And what have you done out
of love for a woman?

1303
01:45:54,914 --> 01:45:56,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I gave her up.

1304
01:45:57,834 --> 01:46:03,784  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Once in a lifetime there
comes a day,

1305
01:46:04,954 --> 01:46:07,184  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
when everything lovers do,
works.

1306
01:46:08,434 --> 01:46:10,868  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You missed your chance.

1307
01:46:16,354 --> 01:46:17,343  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So long.

1308
01:46:21,034 --> 01:46:23,184  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I won't help you any more.

1309
01:46:25,034 --> 01:46:26,865  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I lost interest in you.

1310
01:46:49,594 --> 01:46:51,664  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Want to kill your 100th bear?

1311
01:46:51,914 --> 01:46:54,747  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I will find the princess
and I will kiss her.

1312
01:46:54,994 --> 01:46:56,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And I will turn into a bear!

1313
01:46:57,034 --> 01:46:58,023  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I see.

1314
01:46:58,434 --> 01:46:59,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A 100th bear?

1315
01:47:02,194 --> 01:47:04,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sounds tempting!

1316
01:47:05,034 --> 01:47:06,786  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Interesting idea.

1317
01:47:07,034 --> 01:47:10,026  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I hate to abuse your kindness.

1318
01:47:10,274 --> 01:47:13,425  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't feel awkward, I
volunteered to be your victim.

1319
01:47:13,674 --> 01:47:16,347  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What about the Princess?
- She will be happy.

1320
01:47:16,594 --> 01:47:18,983  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well as they say, the Art
demands sacrifiices.

1321
01:47:20,514 --> 01:47:23,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- How true!
- Thank you, my friend!

1322
01:47:59,514 --> 01:48:05,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I am starting to forget
that tune.

1323
01:48:32,594 --> 01:48:33,583  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's all right.

1324
01:48:48,274 --> 01:48:50,105  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You wrote a bad story.

1325
01:48:51,954 --> 01:48:53,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's time to forget it.

1326
01:48:55,034 --> 01:48:59,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Time will come and you will
write another beautiful one!

1327
01:49:00,434 --> 01:49:01,583  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A merry one!

1328
01:49:03,594 --> 01:49:07,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No. I don't think I can.

1329
01:49:11,354 --> 01:49:13,504  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This was my last story.

1330
01:49:29,834 --> 01:49:34,544  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What does the doctor say?
- What does the doctor say?

1331
01:49:34,834 --> 01:49:37,064  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That the Princess may die.

1332
01:49:37,594 --> 01:49:40,745  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We don't believe that.
That would be too much.

1333
01:49:41,434 --> 01:49:45,268  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You promised to forget.
- All right, I will.

1334
01:49:47,514 --> 01:49:48,947  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Coffee, please.

1335
01:49:51,514 --> 01:49:54,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No use thinking about something,
that can't be brought back.

1336
01:49:54,914 --> 01:49:56,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We promise, we won't.

1337
01:50:00,834 --> 01:50:03,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- When did he come back?
- He didn't.

1338
01:50:04,034 --> 01:50:08,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It was the Hunter. No one
knows, where the bear is.

1339
01:50:08,434 --> 01:50:10,743  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Is he hunting?
- Of course not!

1340
01:50:10,994 --> 01:50:12,985  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He is busy writing a book on
the theory of hunting.

1341
01:50:13,234 --> 01:50:15,464  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- When will it come out?
- No one knows.

1342
01:50:15,714 --> 01:50:17,511  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's only written a few
chapters so far.

1343
01:50:18,274 --> 01:50:21,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's in charge of the
King's Hunting.

1344
01:50:22,514 --> 01:50:27,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Recently married maid of
honor Amanda.

1345
01:50:29,274 --> 01:50:33,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They have a daughter too.
Name Bullet.

1346
01:50:35,354 --> 01:50:38,983  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The hunter's apprentice married
Orynthya. They have a boy.

1347
01:50:40,114 --> 01:50:41,467  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They called him Target.

1348
01:50:53,434 --> 01:50:56,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Did you invite them?
- Orynthya with her son?

1349
01:50:57,034 --> 01:51:01,346  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They never wait for an
invitation.

1350
01:51:02,354 --> 01:51:05,903  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They come whenever they
please. Just like you.

1351
01:51:06,834 --> 01:51:09,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And feel quite at home here.

1352
01:51:10,594 --> 01:51:13,506  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's busy and he doesn't
feel well.

1353
01:51:13,954 --> 01:51:16,866  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And he promised, that's over.

1354
01:51:18,434 --> 01:51:21,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You understand?
- I do.

1355
01:51:21,594 --> 01:51:23,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But I can't do otherwise.

1356
01:51:28,754 --> 01:51:30,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They can't.

1357
01:51:33,754 --> 01:51:35,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And I can't do without
them.

1358
01:51:37,114 --> 01:51:42,142  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Every story has to have an
end.

1359
01:51:43,514 --> 01:51:45,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Some kind of an end.

1360
01:51:47,034 --> 01:51:50,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sad, happy, funny, stupid.

1361
01:51:52,274 --> 01:51:53,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Whatever. But there has
to be an end.

1362
01:51:54,914 --> 01:51:59,385  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They will all come back here,
all except for the Bear.

1363
01:52:01,354 --> 01:52:02,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't want to see him.

1364
01:52:04,594 --> 01:52:09,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I erased him from my
memory.

1365
01:52:10,674 --> 01:52:12,824  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Amanda with her daughter!

1366
01:52:27,754 --> 01:52:28,743  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes...

1367
01:52:30,834 --> 01:52:36,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The princess is suffering,
but life goes on its usual way.

1368
01:52:38,834 --> 01:52:39,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes!

1369
01:52:40,834 --> 01:52:44,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The fiish here is cheaper
than at home.

1370
01:52:46,594 --> 01:52:49,062  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But beef is the same
price.

1371
01:52:49,954 --> 01:52:51,228  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What about vegetables?

1372
01:52:51,954 --> 01:52:55,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The vegetables are
unbelievable!

1373
01:52:57,274 --> 01:53:01,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They lease pumpkins to poor
families.

1374
01:53:02,354 --> 01:53:06,825  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They live inside and they
feed on them.

1375
01:53:09,514 --> 01:53:15,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They tried to rent watermelons
too, but they're too damp.

1376
01:53:34,594 --> 01:53:38,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's say good-bye
In a soft voice,

1377
01:53:39,354 --> 01:53:44,223  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's say good-bye
With a light heart.

1378
01:53:46,034 --> 01:53:52,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A weak or two,
And we will get over it,

1379
01:53:52,594 --> 01:53:57,907  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Everything will remain
In the past,

1380
01:54:00,274 --> 01:54:01,423  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know very well...

1381
01:54:03,194 --> 01:54:06,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What's going on.
You could help us.

1382
01:54:08,434 --> 01:54:10,425  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The Administrator became
a Prince,

1383
01:54:10,674 --> 01:54:12,983  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and he prevents the Bear from
seeing the Princess.

1384
01:54:13,354 --> 01:54:15,584  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It is not the Administrator.

1385
01:54:17,594 --> 01:54:20,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- It is me!
- I don't believe you.

1386
01:55:45,314 --> 01:55:47,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm only doing it to make these
lazy people do something.

1387
01:55:47,914 --> 01:55:48,903  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What a shame.

1388
01:55:51,674 --> 01:55:55,223  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't be sore with me,
my lady.

1389
01:55:57,114 --> 01:55:58,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It was all my fault
in the fiirst place.

1390
01:56:01,354 --> 01:56:04,824  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A Minister's duty is to report
the truth to the King.

1391
01:56:06,674 --> 01:56:09,142  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But I was afraid to grieve
His Majesty.

1392
01:56:13,354 --> 01:56:16,107  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The King must know the truth.

1393
01:56:21,754 --> 01:56:22,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hello!

1394
01:56:26,754 --> 01:56:28,506  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What a beautiful morning!

1395
01:56:29,954 --> 01:56:32,707  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How is everything?
How is the Princess?

1396
01:56:33,594 --> 01:56:36,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All right, don't bother
to answer.

1397
01:56:36,554 --> 01:56:38,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I know everything's well.

1398
01:56:39,354 --> 01:56:40,582  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There, look!

1399
01:56:42,674 --> 01:56:44,824  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Your Majesty...
- Don't!

1400
01:56:45,194 --> 01:56:46,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Farewell.

1401
01:56:48,554 --> 01:56:51,387  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Listen to me!
- I want to sleep.

1402
01:56:52,914 --> 01:56:55,223  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If you won't help
your daughter,

1403
01:56:56,114 --> 01:56:57,547  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
than who will?

1404
01:56:58,834 --> 01:57:00,984  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't you see what's going
on around here?

1405
01:57:03,274 --> 01:57:07,426  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A swindler and an impudent man
without a heart and a mind

1406
01:57:07,674 --> 01:57:09,904  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
has seized power in the
Kingdom.

1407
01:57:10,514 --> 01:57:13,824  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Everything and everyone
serve his purse.

1408
01:57:15,194 --> 01:57:17,264  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
His people are all around
the place,

1409
01:57:17,514 --> 01:57:20,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
carrying bales with goods from
place to place.

1410
01:57:22,194 --> 01:57:25,425  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You have to order to oust this
the Prince-Administrator,

1411
01:57:25,954 --> 01:57:28,263  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and the Princess will feel
better,

1412
01:57:28,514 --> 01:57:31,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and she will no longer be
threatened by this foul wedding.

1413
01:57:32,034 --> 01:57:34,343  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Your Majesty!
- No.

1414
01:57:35,354 --> 01:57:37,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I can't do anything.
- But why?

1415
01:57:40,034 --> 01:57:41,023  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why?

1416
01:57:42,114 --> 01:57:47,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why! Because I am degenerating!

1417
01:57:49,594 --> 01:57:51,505  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I say, you are a fool.

1418
01:57:51,754 --> 01:57:55,224  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You have to read books, then
you'll know, you can't ask a

1419
01:57:55,474 --> 01:57:57,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
King more than he can do!

1420
01:57:57,834 --> 01:57:59,062  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The Princess will die.

1421
01:58:01,034 --> 01:58:02,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let her die.

1422
01:58:03,594 --> 01:58:06,666  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If I feel that something like
that is coming on to me,

1423
01:58:08,114 --> 01:58:09,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll kill myself.

1424
01:58:10,274 --> 01:58:11,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I keep poison especially
for that purpose.

1425
01:58:12,034 --> 01:58:14,343  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I tried it on my partner
just the other day.

1426
01:58:14,594 --> 01:58:15,822  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We were playing a game
of cards.

1427
01:58:16,354 --> 01:58:19,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The stuff worked wonders!
He died without noticing it.

1428
01:58:19,394 --> 01:58:20,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why all the shouting?!

1429
01:58:21,034 --> 01:58:24,743  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You needn't worry about me.
- We worry about the Princess.

1430
01:58:25,754 --> 01:58:27,984  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're not worrying
about your King?

1431
01:58:28,954 --> 01:58:30,546  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, Your Excellency!

1432
01:58:31,594 --> 01:58:35,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What did you call me?
- Your Excellency.

1433
01:58:36,194 --> 01:58:39,425  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You addressed the greatest of
all kings by a general's title?

1434
01:58:39,674 --> 01:58:43,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- That is a riot! - Yes I have
raised my voice against you.

1435
01:58:44,914 --> 01:58:46,347  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm standing up to you!

1436
01:58:47,594 --> 01:58:49,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And you are not the
greatest of all kings!

1437
01:58:50,034 --> 01:58:52,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Just an outstanding
one, that's all.

1438
01:58:53,194 --> 01:58:54,343  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What, are you gonna
bite me?

1439
01:58:55,194 --> 01:58:56,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Outstanding, but not more!

1440
01:58:57,154 --> 01:59:00,464  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And you're not worthy of the
title ''honorary Saint''.

1441
01:59:00,714 --> 01:59:02,909  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You ma be a hermit,
but you're no saint.

1442
01:59:03,274 --> 01:59:04,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Call the executioner!
- He won't come.

1443
01:59:05,154 --> 01:59:08,703  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He writes poems for the
Administrator's newspaper.

1444
01:59:09,954 --> 01:59:12,866  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You're not coming?
- Nope.

1445
01:59:13,914 --> 01:59:19,307  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Call the Administrator
Minister!

1446
01:59:20,754 --> 01:59:21,743  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No respect!

1447
01:59:26,754 --> 01:59:27,743  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But why?

1448
01:59:29,114 --> 01:59:30,103  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
For what reason?

1449
01:59:30,354 --> 01:59:34,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who dares to mistreat
the ruler,

1450
01:59:34,954 --> 01:59:37,184  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
our little homely King!

1451
01:59:37,434 --> 01:59:40,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They don't show me any respect,
they want me to get rid of you.

1452
01:59:40,794 --> 01:59:43,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The lousy plotters with
their intrigues.

1453
01:59:44,514 --> 01:59:46,584  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- They're scaring me.
- What with?

1454
01:59:46,834 --> 01:59:50,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They say the Princess
will die of love.

1455
01:59:50,754 --> 01:59:53,826  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What utter nonsense!
Gibberish, as I call it.

1456
02:00:00,194 --> 02:00:02,185  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Our family doctor,

1457
02:00:03,194 --> 02:00:06,504  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
mine and the King's,

1458
02:00:07,194 --> 02:00:10,982  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
examined the Princess and
reported on her health condition

1459
02:00:11,234 --> 02:00:15,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He found no symptoms
of any love disease.

1460
02:00:15,674 --> 02:00:18,507  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's fiirst. And second...

1461
02:00:19,274 --> 02:00:22,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All love illnesses are
a mere trifle,

1462
02:00:22,434 --> 02:00:25,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and a cause for jokes,

1463
02:00:25,954 --> 02:00:27,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
but they're nothing lethal
and easily curable.

1464
02:00:28,834 --> 02:00:30,506  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If you don't neglect them.

1465
02:00:30,754 --> 02:00:33,587  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What's this talk about death?
- That's what I'm saying.

1466
02:00:33,834 --> 02:00:36,348  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The doctor knows better!

1467
02:00:36,594 --> 02:00:40,382  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The doctor is certain, the
Princess will get well soon.

1468
02:00:40,634 --> 02:00:44,627  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Must be the wedding fever.
- As they call it.

1469
02:00:45,434 --> 02:00:46,787  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
As I call it.

1470
02:00:50,754 --> 02:00:52,187  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Here!
- What is it?

1471
02:00:52,834 --> 02:00:55,064  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- The doctor ran away!
- That's impossible!

1472
02:00:55,314 --> 02:00:58,784  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I went to see him about
the calming drops,

1473
02:00:59,034 --> 02:01:02,265  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and I find rooms unlocked,
drawers open and wardrobe empty.

1474
02:01:02,514 --> 02:01:03,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And a note on the table.

1475
02:01:04,074 --> 02:01:07,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't show it to me.
I'm afraid!

1476
02:01:08,434 --> 02:01:12,666  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How do you like that?! No
executioner, no gendarmes!

1477
02:01:13,354 --> 02:01:15,584  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You are pigs, and disloyal
at that!

1478
02:01:16,074 --> 02:01:19,703  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't follow me!
I won't listen to you!

1479
02:01:21,674 --> 02:01:23,187  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I am not listening!

1480
02:01:24,114 --> 02:01:28,187  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Show me that note.
- Read it to me.

1481
02:01:29,354 --> 02:01:31,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
''Only a miracle can save
the princess...

1482
02:01:32,234 --> 02:01:34,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
''You make her suffer, but I
will be the one you will blame.

1483
02:01:35,034 --> 02:01:39,585  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
''Doctors are human beings too,
they want to live. Good-bye.''

1484
02:01:39,834 --> 02:01:42,587  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Damn! The traitor!
How inopportunely!

1485
02:01:42,834 --> 02:01:43,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Doctor!

1486
02:01:45,754 --> 02:01:48,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Call him and say it is all
his fault. Quick!

1487
02:01:53,754 --> 02:01:56,222  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, please, don't stand up,
my friends.

1488
02:02:02,034 --> 02:02:04,184  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Today is such an
extraordinary day!

1489
02:02:06,834 --> 02:02:08,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Today whatever I try to do
works.

1490
02:02:09,914 --> 02:02:14,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Things, that I thought were
lost, somehow appear again.

1491
02:02:22,434 --> 02:02:24,902  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If I think about the past,

1492
02:02:25,354 --> 02:02:28,744  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
only the best comes to mind.

1493
02:02:29,034 --> 02:02:31,343  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
In this way life must
be saying good-bye to me.

1494
02:02:32,754 --> 02:02:35,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Did they tell you I am
going to die today?

1495
02:02:37,594 --> 02:02:39,346  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But Princess...

1496
02:02:39,754 --> 02:02:42,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes, it's even more frightening
than I thought.

1497
02:02:43,594 --> 02:02:47,507  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Death is gross and dirty.

1498
02:02:49,594 --> 02:02:53,428  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It comes with a sack full of
loathsome instruments.

1499
02:02:53,834 --> 02:02:56,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But how do you know all
that, Princess?

1500
02:03:09,274 --> 02:03:12,744  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Death came so close,
that I could see it all.

1501
02:03:19,274 --> 02:03:20,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But that's enough.

1502
02:03:22,674 --> 02:03:25,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Talk to me as if nothing
happened.

1503
02:03:25,754 --> 02:03:29,793  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joke, smile, tell me
stories.

1504
02:03:31,034 --> 02:03:34,743  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I just don't want to think
about what's going to happen.

1505
02:03:36,354 --> 02:03:37,343  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who is that?

1506
02:03:38,434 --> 02:03:39,423  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who?!

1507
02:03:40,914 --> 02:03:41,903  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who is it?

1508
02:03:44,034 --> 02:03:45,023  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who is it?!

1509
02:03:53,834 --> 02:03:54,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you hear it?

1510
02:03:56,954 --> 02:03:58,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Do you hear?
- Yes.

1511
02:04:39,354 --> 02:04:41,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm sorry, I was afraid
of being late.

1512
02:04:43,954 --> 02:04:47,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Leave, everyone,
except the Princess.

1513
02:04:51,434 --> 02:04:53,743  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How did you get here?

1514
02:04:54,114 --> 02:04:56,025  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I isolated you.

1515
02:04:56,274 --> 02:04:58,868  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Please leave now.

1516
02:05:01,034 --> 02:05:03,184  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Or I will want to
kill you again.

1517
02:05:04,354 --> 02:05:06,424  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Only this time I will
really do it.

1518
02:05:07,434 --> 02:05:09,664  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He will do it.

1519
02:05:10,274 --> 02:05:12,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Please leave now.

1520
02:05:17,754 --> 02:05:19,187  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why are you crying?

1521
02:05:28,434 --> 02:05:29,423  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm crying of happiness.

1522
02:05:32,594 --> 02:05:34,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now I have a secret,
with which

1523
02:05:34,554 --> 02:05:38,183  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I wouldn't trust anyone,
not even the closest friends,

1524
02:05:38,434 --> 02:05:39,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
only you.

1525
02:05:41,354 --> 02:05:42,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I love you.

1526
02:05:47,674 --> 02:05:49,187  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I love you.
That's the truth!

1527
02:05:49,434 --> 02:05:52,904  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I love you so much
I will forgive you anything.

1528
02:05:54,354 --> 02:05:57,346  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You want to turn into a bear?
Very well.

1529
02:05:59,194 --> 02:06:01,867  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Only don't leave me.

1530
02:06:05,114 --> 02:06:09,744  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I couldn't bare to be
alone again!

1531
02:06:10,914 --> 02:06:13,223  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What took you so long?

1532
02:06:14,034 --> 02:06:15,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No-no, don't answer.

1533
02:06:16,194 --> 02:06:18,185  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I won't ask you.

1534
02:06:18,434 --> 02:06:21,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If you didn't come, that's
because you couldn't.

1535
02:06:21,394 --> 02:06:22,543  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I will not reproach you.

1536
02:06:22,794 --> 02:06:26,707  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I will be patient.
Only don't leave me.

1537
02:06:35,594 --> 02:06:38,427  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Today death came very close.

1538
02:06:39,274 --> 02:06:40,343  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's true.

1539
02:06:41,434 --> 02:06:42,662  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But I am not afraid of it.

1540
02:06:44,194 --> 02:06:47,584  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I am so happy, I don't know
anything about death and grief.

1541
02:06:48,754 --> 02:06:52,542  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Especially now, when you are
standing so close.

1542
02:06:54,914 --> 02:06:57,986  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No one ever came this
close to me.

1543
02:06:59,274 --> 02:07:02,346  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No one ever came this
close to me,

1544
02:07:03,194 --> 02:07:04,547  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and no one ever held
me tight.

1545
02:07:05,674 --> 02:07:09,064  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You are holding me, like
you have the right to,

1546
02:07:09,314 --> 02:07:12,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and I like that.

1547
02:07:19,114 --> 02:07:22,106  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's go to my room.

1548
02:07:23,434 --> 02:07:26,983  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll show you the room, where
I spent so many hours crying.

1549
02:07:27,514 --> 02:07:30,586  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The balcony from which I looked
to see if you were coming,

1550
02:07:30,834 --> 02:07:32,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A hundred books about bears.

1551
02:07:33,954 --> 02:07:35,865  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Bears were all I could
read about.

1552
02:08:07,114 --> 02:08:08,103  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It is all my fault.

1553
02:08:09,954 --> 02:08:11,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We can't do anything
about that now.

1554
02:08:19,194 --> 02:08:20,468  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes, it is your fault.

1555
02:08:21,674 --> 02:08:23,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why did you do that?

1556
02:08:24,594 --> 02:08:26,505  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I warned you, didn't I?

1557
02:08:31,674 --> 02:08:35,383  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's the way I am.

1558
02:08:38,034 --> 02:08:42,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I wanted to talk to you
about love.

1559
02:08:44,954 --> 02:08:46,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But I'm a magician.

1560
02:08:49,034 --> 02:08:50,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Remember, what you said?

1561
02:08:52,674 --> 02:08:54,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Do you?
- I remember.

1562
02:08:58,034 --> 02:09:02,027  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So I took all these people
and reshuffled them.

1563
02:09:03,434 --> 02:09:07,825  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And they lived, so that you
would laugh and cry.

1564
02:09:09,034 --> 02:09:10,023  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I am crying.

1565
02:09:10,434 --> 02:09:13,506  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Some of them worked better,
Some worSe,

1566
02:09:14,514 --> 02:09:16,664  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
but I've grown used to them.

1567
02:09:17,754 --> 02:09:19,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I couldn't cross them out,
could I?

1568
02:09:19,954 --> 02:09:21,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They're not words -
they're people.

1569
02:09:22,914 --> 02:09:26,145  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sometimes I even let them
argue with me,

1570
02:09:26,954 --> 02:09:28,103  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and disobey me.

1571
02:09:36,754 --> 02:09:39,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sleep, darling.

1572
02:09:54,194 --> 02:09:57,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Unfortunately, I am
immortal.

1573
02:10:02,354 --> 02:10:04,424  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I will have to outlive you,

1574
02:10:06,674 --> 02:10:08,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and forever miss you.

1575
02:10:09,914 --> 02:10:11,267  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But now you are with me.

1576
02:10:13,674 --> 02:10:17,462  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Glory to the brave ones,

1577
02:10:19,354 --> 02:10:21,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
who have enough courage
to love,

1578
02:10:21,834 --> 02:10:24,302  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
knowing that everything
has to end.

1579
02:10:28,954 --> 02:10:30,546  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Glory to the daring,

1580
02:10:31,954 --> 02:10:36,664  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
who live as though they
will live forever.

1581
02:10:59,434 --> 02:11:03,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Why aren't you asleep?
- Don't scare away the bear!

1582
02:11:08,034 --> 02:11:09,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Let's go back.
- No.

1583
02:11:09,674 --> 02:11:12,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Let's go to your place.
- I'm scared.

1584
02:11:16,114 --> 02:11:17,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're hurting me.

1585
02:11:21,754 --> 02:11:23,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, please, don't be
offended.

1586
02:11:25,514 --> 02:11:27,425  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let it be the way you
want it.

1587
02:11:28,354 --> 02:11:30,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
God, I'm so happy that I
have decided everything!

1588
02:11:31,354 --> 02:11:34,824  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Foolish me! I didn't know it
could be that good.

1589
02:11:39,114 --> 02:11:41,025  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
let's do it your way.

1590
02:12:21,114 --> 02:12:22,103  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well!

1591
02:12:55,034 --> 02:12:56,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm terribly sorry.

1592
02:12:57,514 --> 02:13:00,187  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't want to interfere
in your work,

1593
02:13:01,834 --> 02:13:04,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
but I think just now a
miracle happened.

1594
02:13:06,114 --> 02:13:07,103  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Very well could be.

1595
02:13:09,114 --> 02:13:10,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why are you surprised?

1596
02:13:11,194 --> 02:13:14,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What's going on?!
I was promised,

1597
02:13:14,954 --> 02:13:17,024  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
that he will turn into
a bear.

1598
02:13:17,674 --> 02:13:20,507  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You confiirmed that.
- I did.

1599
02:13:20,754 --> 02:13:21,743  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So where's the bear?

1600
02:13:21,994 --> 02:13:27,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I confiirmed it, because I
was not too clever.

1601
02:13:32,594 --> 02:13:34,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But I don't regret it now.

1602
02:13:35,954 --> 02:13:39,026  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I found your last story
very amusing.

1603
02:13:39,434 --> 02:13:41,345  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
At least it is good.

1604
02:13:42,754 --> 02:13:44,187  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Perhaps even the best.

1605
02:13:56,754 --> 02:13:59,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's say good-bye
In a soft voice,

1606
02:14:00,274 --> 02:14:03,027  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's say good-bye
In a low voice,

1607
02:14:04,034 --> 02:14:08,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's say good-bye
With a light heart.

1608
02:14:11,034 --> 02:14:13,946  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A week or two,

1609
02:14:14,354 --> 02:14:17,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And we'll get over it,

1610
02:14:17,754 --> 02:14:22,544  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And everything will remain
In the past.

1611
02:14:25,194 --> 02:14:28,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It is sad,

1612
02:14:28,594 --> 02:14:31,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It is senseless and
Meaningless.

1613
02:14:32,194 --> 02:14:36,824  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh, how good it would be
To start all over again.

1614
02:14:39,034 --> 02:14:45,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But it is impossible to
Go back to where it started.

1615
02:14:46,194 --> 02:14:50,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't even dream about it.

1616
02:14:53,594 --> 02:14:58,987  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It was charming,
It was fun,

1617
02:15:00,194 --> 02:15:06,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But it slipped away, and it
Is not there any more.
