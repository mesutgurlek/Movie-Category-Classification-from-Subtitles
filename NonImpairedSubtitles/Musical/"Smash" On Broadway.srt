00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:46,504
I, uh, trust there are no objections?

166
00:07:46,506 --> 00:07:48,440
Nope.

167
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:50,976
Okay, good.
Let's talk about the reviews.

168
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:52,477
Uh, remember, I haven't read them.

169
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,147
- You're not serious.
- She never does.

170
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:56,515
I just read Tom's face.

171
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,366
It tells me everything I need to know.

172
00:07:58,368 --> 00:07:59,951
Oh, did Tom's face tell you
what they singled out, then?

173
00:07:59,953 --> 00:08:01,620
Me, the cast...
Derek.

174
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:03,205
She's the one who hasn't read them.

175
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:05,791
I don't need some critic
getting in my head.

176
00:08:05,793 --> 00:08:07,542
I sat in the audience for three weeks.

177
00:08:07,544 --> 00:08:09,711
I know there are things
that need to be done.

178
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:12,464
I want this to be the best it can be.

179
00:08:12,466 --> 00:08:13,866
And that's what we're going to do.

180
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:15,967
After my meeting tonight
with Jordan roth,

181
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:17,869
we're going to book the best theater

182
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:19,471
Broadway has to offer...

183
00:08:19,473 --> 00:08:20,872
The St. James.

184
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:23,675
Oh, the St. James
would be so amazing.

185

<i>The king and I.</i>

186

Both:
<i>The producers.</i>

187
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,046
- Big hits.
- Long runs.

188
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:29,981
- Good juju.
- Yeah, okay, great, um...

189
00:08:29,983 --> 00:08:32,067
What if we don't get
a theater today, hmm?

190
00:08:32,069 --> 00:08:33,852
I've got a lot of projects
waiting to hear

191
00:08:33,854 --> 00:08:35,687
how busy I'm gonna be...
I want to know what to plan for.

192
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:38,323
Don't worry about it, Derek.
I'll get it.

193
00:08:38,325 --> 00:08:40,659
Meanwhile, keep our leading lady happy.

194
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:42,511
Everyone's talking about her.

195
00:08:42,513 --> 00:08:44,162
They want to know if she's
as good as they've heard.

196
00:08:44,164 --> 00:08:45,730
Oh, she's better.

197
00:08:45,732 --> 00:08:48,200
Yes, we all know
where you stand on the matter.

198
00:08:48,202 --> 00:08:50,418
Oh, and it's not just me.

199
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,403
Or didn't you read the reviews either?

200
00:08:52,405 --> 00:08:55,257
Oh, God, not listening.

201

Yeah, well, can we not do it

212
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:18,129
Bye, Derek.

213
00:09:18,131 --> 00:09:21,432
Thank you, Ana, for letting me move in

214
00:09:21,434 --> 00:09:23,201
and everything.

215
00:09:23,203 --> 00:09:24,619
Well, thank my roommate
for doing that Disney cruise.

216
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:26,204
Where are you going tonight,
by the way?

217
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:28,773
Derek is taking me
to see Veronica Moore

218
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:30,275
and then meet her after.

219
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:32,210
Oh, you get to meet her?
I'm so jealous.

220
00:09:32,212 --> 00:09:35,547
She's incredible.
You're gonna love the show too.

221
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:39,134
It's about this, like, sweet,
1950s aretha/etta James type,

222
00:09:39,136 --> 00:09:40,552
but she has
this really overbearing mother.

223
00:09:40,554 --> 00:09:42,470
- Well, don't spoil it.
- Here.

224
00:09:42,472 --> 00:09:46,308
- How do I look?
- Like you care.

225
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,127
Maybe I do.
See ya later, sweet cheeks.

226
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:51,062
Bye.

227
00:09:51,064 --> 00:09:53,064
So what'd your agent say?

228
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:55,734
When I told him that
he should expect a phone call

229
00:09:55,736 --> 00:09:57,802
about my contract,
he said that the agency

230
00:09:57,804 --> 00:10:00,822
had already received phone calls
for their other clients.

231
00:10:00,824 --> 00:10:02,640
Maybe they're calling alphabetically.

232
00:10:02,642 --> 00:10:04,109
They just haven't gotten to "l" yet.

233
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:06,477
Did you get a call, Sam Strickland?

234
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:08,496
Yeah.

235
00:10:08,498 --> 00:10:09,781
What can I do about it?

236
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:11,750
Besides be on your best behavior...

237
00:10:11,752 --> 00:10:13,501
Which I know you already are...

238
00:10:13,503 --> 00:10:17,672
You got to find a way
to stay with the show.

239
00:10:17,674 --> 00:10:19,257
Any suggestions?

240
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:22,660
Well, you're an amazing singer,

241
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:24,346
an even better actress.

242
00:10:24,348 --> 00:10:25,830
Remind everybody why they fell in love

243
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:27,349
with you in the first place.

244
00:10:27,351 --> 00:10:29,634
Once you do that,
you can get back on the road

245
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:32,270
to becoming the star
you were intended to be.

246
00:10:32,272 --> 00:10:35,857
What is a star, anyway?
Do they even still exist?

I can't wait.

Another good-girl role
for Broadway's sweetheart.

307
00:12:57,834 --> 00:13:00,668
As long as you keep
winning them Tonys, darling.

308
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,321
Oh, if you don't mind me saying,

309
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:05,623
the speech you gave
when you won your first one,

310
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,959
about the things you gave up
when you started out

311
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:09,844
and how those sacrifices
weren't for nothing,

312
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:11,679
it was a huge inspiration to me.

313
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:13,798
I have a question, Ronnie.

314
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
What is the best piece of advice

315
00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:17,335
you would give to someone
who's about to get

316
00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:20,321
exactly where you are?

317
00:13:20,323 --> 00:13:22,941
That's easy.
Protect the work.

318
00:13:22,943 --> 00:13:26,861
The moment you lose focus,
the moment the work suffers.

319
00:13:26,863 --> 00:13:28,646
Someone's always waiting
to take you down, honey.

320
00:13:28,648 --> 00:13:32,984
But if the work's good,

Have you ever done that?

486
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:45,356
You didn't allow yourself
to feel a second of happiness

over the reviews you got.

488
00:20:46,842 --> 00:20:48,359
I mean, what did <i>Variety</i> say again?

Look, I allowed myself
some happiness in private.

493

I just didn't want it to seem

494
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,790
like I was gloating around Julia.

495
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:04,458
I mean, she got...

I'll tell her, in time, just not yet.

499

Her focus needs to be on her marriage.

We're partners, Sam.
It's my job to protect her.

501
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:18,372
As her partner, it's your job

to be the one person who doesn't.

I mean, if you can't tell her, who can?

Maybe I'll never have to.

Maybe she'll figure out her problems...

You may be a womanizer,

but I know there's no merit
to her story.

Yeah, well, you might want to tell that

I'll say hello to Eileen.

And here I was,

00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:41,339
throwing a party and thinking
I could talk about the show

said he's coming tonight.

I want you to turn him away
at the door.

I don't think so.

He just ran a quote out of context.

I don't blame Michael Riedel
for your mess,

Yes.

00:43:51,631 --> 00:43:54,132
I don't want to hang out.
I just want...

976
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:56,184
You know what?
Forget it.

977
00:43:56,186 --> 00:44:00,004
See ya.

978
00:44:00,006 --> 00:44:01,672
Dude, was that Karen Cartwright?

979
00:44:01,674 --> 00:44:03,341
No idea.

980
00:44:03,343 --> 00:44:04,943
She's the girl I told you about,

981
00:44:04,945 --> 00:44:06,344
the one that was here the other night.

982
00:44:06,346 --> 00:44:08,446
She's a big deal.
She could help us.

983
00:44:08,448 --> 00:44:10,098
We do it on our own, all right?

984
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,849
We don't need anyone's help.

985
00:44:11,851 --> 00:44:14,402
Move it.
I'm late.

986
00:44:16,355 --> 00:44:18,790
Derek, it's me. Um, I just
wanted to let you know

987
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:20,792
I finally got in touch
with that composer.

988
00:44:20,794 --> 00:44:22,693
- Hey! Hey, Karen, wait up!
- Um, it turn...

989
00:44:22,695 --> 00:44:26,297
And... um, I got
to call you back.

990
00:44:26,299 --> 00:44:28,699
Hey.
Hey.

991
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:30,718
Look, I'm sorry about whatever
he said to you back there.

992
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,836
That guy's your friend, right?

993
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:33,371
Why, exactly?
I know.

994
00:44:33,373 --> 00:44:35,056
He's complicated.

995
00:44:35,058 --> 00:44:36,558
But he's a really good guy
when you get to know him

996
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,176
and an amazing composer.

997
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:39,978
He's just really protective
of our stuff.

998
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,846
Well, I wanted to hear more,
play it for my friend Derek,

999
00:44:41,848 --> 00:44:44,182
see what he thought.
Derek, as in Derek Wills?

1000
00:44:44,184 --> 00:44:47,218
[Chuckles] Like... like
<i>the</i> Derek Wills? He's, uh...

1001
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,020
Irrelevant to this conversation,

1002
00:44:49,022 --> 00:44:50,572
since your friend
clearly isn't interested.

1003
00:44:50,574 --> 00:44:52,073
Yes, he is.

1004
00:44:52,075 --> 00:44:54,075
He just doesn't know it yet,
and so am I.

1005
00:44:54,077 --> 00:44:55,860
Look, can you meet me
in a couple hours,

1006
00:44:55,862 --> 00:44:57,362
when I'm done with my shift?

1007
00:44:57,364 --> 00:44:59,864
There's something I want to show you.

1008
00:44:59,866 --> 00:45:02,200
I realize your clients
haven't gotten paid, Saul.

1009
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:04,335
No one has.
I'm truly sorry.

1010
00:45:04,337 --> 00:45:07,255
But mark my words, I'll have
this all ironed out,

1011
00:45:07,257 --> 00:45:08,406
<i>tout de suite!</i>

1012
00:45:08,408 --> 00:45:11,909
Now, if you'll excuse me...

1013
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:16,047
The fact I was able to stage
a single number

1014
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:17,715
in the middle of that circus
you and Julia created

1015
00:45:17,717 --> 00:45:19,250
is nothing short of a miracle.

1016
00:45:19,252 --> 00:45:21,085
"Circus"... how choice.

1017
00:45:21,087 --> 00:45:24,755
Let's talk about you juggling
every Marilyn in the show.

1018
00:45:24,757 --> 00:45:27,392
Boys, there's nothing to be gained

1019
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:29,227
by turning on each other.

1020
00:45:29,229 --> 00:45:30,945
But it feels good.

1021
00:45:30,947 --> 00:45:34,932
All right, then...
Maybe we should turn on you.

1022
00:45:34,934 --> 00:45:37,735
Did it not even seem
a little bit strange to you

1023
00:45:37,737 --> 00:45:40,238
that a Brooklyn bartender
and his funny little friends

1024
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,123
had millions of dollars
in cash lying around?

1025
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:44,075
I have spent the last three hours

1026
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:46,978
with the federal government
and my accountant,

1027
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,447
going through every bill,
receipt, and pay stub

1028
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:51,032
since the beginning of time.

1029
00:45:51,034 --> 00:45:52,634
It's all in order.

1030
00:45:52,636 --> 00:45:54,819
Did they say
when we could get back to work?

1031
00:45:54,821 --> 00:45:57,255
No, but we're still alive.

1032
00:45:57,257 --> 00:46:00,892
Karen is singing tonight at
the American theatre wing gala.

1033
00:46:00,894 --> 00:46:03,294
Every Broadway bigwig will be there.

1034
00:46:03,296 --> 00:46:05,763
So, for now, I'd like
to ask both of you

1035
00:46:05,765 --> 00:46:08,066
please not to accept any other project

1036
00:46:08,068 --> 00:46:09,800
until all of this is settled.

1037
00:46:09,802 --> 00:46:11,653
Yeah, I can't make that
guarantee... I need to work.

1038
00:46:11,655 --> 00:46:14,639
You have offers
after last week's revelations?

1039
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:16,257
Yeah.

1040
00:46:16,259 --> 00:46:18,243
Rebecca Duvall has moved on,
so have the tabloids.

1041
00:46:18,245 --> 00:46:19,911
So, beyond directing

1042
00:46:19,913 --> 00:46:22,163
one of Broadway's
biggest stars in <i>The Wiz,</i>

1043
00:46:22,165 --> 00:46:24,982
- yes, I have several offers.
- Amazing.

1044
00:46:24,984 --> 00:46:26,150
What a business.

1045
00:46:26,152 --> 00:46:27,168
Oh, Tom.

1046
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:28,603
Did you pack something warm

1047
00:46:28,605 --> 00:46:30,588
for your trip to the moral high ground?

1048
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,257
Why don't you both
get out of my office?

1049
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:35,493
I'll let you know what happens tonight.

1050
00:46:35,495 --> 00:46:37,762
Julia and I are here for you,
whatever you need.

1051
00:46:37,764 --> 00:46:39,297
You are.

1052
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:41,666
This is the third meeting
Julia's missed.

1053
00:46:41,668 --> 00:46:43,468
She had a college thing with Leo.

1054
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,637
[Phone ringing]

1055
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:50,508
It's Miriam Abramson's office
on line e... on

1056
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:53,511
the American theatre wing.

1057
00:46:53,513 --> 00:46:55,446
I'm so jealous.

1058
00:46:55,448 --> 00:46:57,348
You're going on tour
with <i>The Book of Mormon,</i>

1059
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:59,850
and I can't even get a callback
for an eHarmony commercial.

1060
00:46:59,852 --> 00:47:01,686
You got to bug your agent more.

1061
00:47:01,688 --> 00:47:03,655
Are you kidding me?
That's all I've been doing.

1062
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:05,323
But you are Ivy Lynn.

1063
00:47:05,325 --> 00:47:07,208
She don't stay down for long.

1064
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:08,993
At least you're not Lisa McMann.

1065
00:47:08,995 --> 00:47:10,662
Approaching, approaching.
Oh, my God, oh, my God,

1066
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:12,863
oh, my God, oh, my God...
I cannot face that woman today.

1067
00:47:12,865 --> 00:47:16,701
She's been plugging away
longer than I have.

1068
00:47:16,703 --> 00:47:19,370
Ivy? And Sam?

1069
00:47:19,372 --> 00:47:21,506
- [Squeals] Oh, my God!
- Lisa McMann!

1070
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:23,141
- Hi!
- Oh!

1071
00:47:23,143 --> 00:47:24,559
This is too funny!

1072
00:47:24,561 --> 00:47:26,711
I was just thinking about you guys

1073
00:47:26,713 --> 00:47:28,146
and that awful Shakespeare festival

1074
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:29,880
we did in the adirondacks.

1075
00:47:29,882 --> 00:47:32,400
Ugh, don't remind me.
[Laughs]

1076
00:47:32,402 --> 00:47:35,219
So what have you been up to?

1077
00:47:35,221 --> 00:47:37,238
Stationery!

1078
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,856
Yeah!

1079
00:47:38,858 --> 00:47:42,193
I got out of the biz,
and my whole life changed.

1080
00:47:42,195 --> 00:47:44,061
Now I make my own hours.

1081
00:47:44,063 --> 00:47:45,530
People actually want
what I'm offering...

1082
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:47,415
No more rejection,
rejection, rejection.

1083
00:47:47,417 --> 00:47:50,401
Oh, um...
Here is my guesthouse.

1084
00:47:50,403 --> 00:47:52,370
Yeah.
[Giggles]

1085
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:54,589
Oh, how about you guys?

1086
00:47:58,043 --> 00:47:59,744
Hello, darling.

1087
00:47:59,746 --> 00:48:01,879
How's my second favorite
agent in the world?

1088
00:48:01,881 --> 00:48:03,881
Oh.
Very sweet.

1089
00:48:03,883 --> 00:48:05,082
Loving the purple.

1090
00:48:05,084 --> 00:48:06,551
- Thank you.
- So...

1091
00:48:06,553 --> 00:48:07,885
Got some news for me?

1092
00:48:07,887 --> 00:48:09,587
What's happening with <i>The Wiz?</i>

1093
00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:11,756
Well, Ronnie's a big fan, as you know,

1094
00:48:11,758 --> 00:48:13,591
and she remains that way.

1095
00:48:13,593 --> 00:48:16,394
She fought hard for you
with the producers.

1096
00:48:16,396 --> 00:48:17,729
Whoa, wait.

1097
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:20,515
Am I hearing a past tense in there?

1098
00:48:20,517 --> 00:48:22,099
They're letting you go.

1099
00:48:22,101 --> 00:48:24,435
Just because I shagged
a couple of actresses?

1100
00:48:24,437 --> 00:48:25,903
That's ludicrous.

1101
00:48:25,905 --> 00:48:28,039
Well, it's not just because of that.

1102
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:29,940
The local news has a story.

1103
00:48:29,942 --> 00:48:31,576
We got the heads-up
an hour ago.

1104
00:48:31,578 --> 00:48:34,612
Five dancers have come forward

1105
00:48:34,614 --> 00:48:37,448
and are accusing you
of sexual harassment.

1106
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:39,801
I have the names here somewhere.

1107
00:48:39,803 --> 00:48:41,386
Um...

1108
00:48:41,388 --> 00:48:43,621
I don't want to talk
to her assistant again.

1109
00:48:43,623 --> 00:48:46,257
I want to talk to her.

1110
00:48:47,593 --> 00:48:49,811
Looks nothing like you.
[Chuckling]

1111
00:48:49,813 --> 00:48:52,397
I knew I should have moved offices.

1112
00:48:52,399 --> 00:48:55,483
Jerry...

1113
00:48:55,485 --> 00:48:58,403
I'm in a particularly tight spot,

1114
00:48:58,405 --> 00:48:59,604
and you owe me.

1115
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:01,122
- I do?
- Yes.

1116
00:49:01,124 --> 00:49:02,940
You're giving me your table tonight

1117
00:49:02,942 --> 00:49:04,659
for the American theatre wing gala.

1118
00:49:04,661 --> 00:49:06,477
I thought you were already going.

1119
00:49:06,479 --> 00:49:08,279
I thought I was too.

1120
00:49:08,281 --> 00:49:11,132
But Miriam Abramson's
assistant called to say

1121
00:49:11,134 --> 00:49:12,950
that I am no longer on the guest list.

1122
00:49:12,952 --> 00:49:14,969
Is that so?

1123
00:49:14,971 --> 00:49:18,172
I have only a small window
of opportunity for <i>Bombshell,</i>

1124
00:49:18,174 --> 00:49:20,007
and I will not have it closed.

1125
00:49:20,009 --> 00:49:22,510
I refuse to be treated like a criminal.

1126
00:49:22,512 --> 00:49:24,762
So...

1127
00:49:24,764 --> 00:49:26,848
You want to be my date, hmm?

1128
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:28,666
[Laughs] Oh, no.
You're not going.

1129
00:49:28,668 --> 00:49:30,852
It'll be just me and my creative team.

1130
00:49:30,854 --> 00:49:33,604
I hear Julia's a mess.

1131
00:49:33,606 --> 00:49:36,023
<i>The Wiz</i> dropped Derek
