1
00:02:18,196 --> 00:02:20,323
<i>This is a Renoir.</i>

2
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,526
Actually, it is the painting of the daughter
of the marquis de Marineau...

3
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:25,569
and was said
to have been done in 1894.

4
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,968
Renoir is famous
for his paintings of children...

5
00:02:28,072 --> 00:02:30,336
but this
is one of his finest.

6
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,842
Here we have a Corot.

7
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:37,005
<i>In this painting, the foliage, far more than
any signature, proclaims the painter.</i>

8
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,276
Note the rich use
of browns and yellow-

9
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:45,987
<i>A truly fine example of Corot at his best.</i>

10
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,025
And now, as is customary,
we conclude the tour...

11
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,619
with the Pendleton
family portraits.

12
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:59,170
<i>Uh, here we have a portrait
of the firstJervis Pendleton...</i>

13
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,603
painted by
James Abbott McNeill Whistler.

14
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:08,112
<i>Jervis Pendleton II sat,
or stood, as you can see...</i>

15
00:03:08,213 --> 00:03:11,376
<i>forJohn Singer Sargent,
whose portraits are hung...</i>

16
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,883
in every important museum
in the world.

17
00:03:15,086 --> 00:03:17,554
<i>Please, madam.!</i>

18
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,714
Oh, I must insist
that you stay with the group.

19
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:24,557
Oh, yes, of course. But what is that
in that room up there?

20
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:28,154
That, madam,
is Jervis Pendleton III.

21
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:30,598
Who, as you
can see, has, uh...

22
00:03:30,702 --> 00:03:35,002
broken with the family
tradition somewhat.

23
00:03:46,584 --> 00:03:48,916
Griggs speaking.

24
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,253
Baldwin Brothers, 99.
Dexter Chemicals, 35.

25
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,418
Just a moment.

26
00:04:00,331 --> 00:04:02,663
- Good. Buy both.
- Both.

27
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,228
Mr. Pendleton
accepts both offers.

28
00:04:07,338 --> 00:04:11,069
Griggs speaking.

29
00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:14,872
Native Boy, three-eighths of a mile,
34 and two-fifths seconds.

30
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:17,174
Just a moment.

31
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,613
Your horse.
Your horse!

32
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,624
Mr. Pendleton wants
two dollars across the board.

33
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:33,390
Griggs speaking!

34
00:04:33,498 --> 00:04:36,797
Oh, yes, that matter will be attended to
immediately. I'll call you right back.

35
00:04:38,503 --> 00:04:40,698
What shall I tell
the man about-

36
00:05:01,492 --> 00:05:03,483
Hey! Hey.

37
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,529
Aw, no!

38
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:10,432
Griggs. Griggs, you can't
do that to me. You can't d-

39
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:12,435
The State Department has b-

40
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,400
- State Department has been trying to reach you.
- I don't care who's been trying.

41
00:05:17,508 --> 00:05:19,499
I was right in
the middle of a... thing.

42
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,772
It's about the economic
mission to France.

43
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:24,177
The secretary must know
your decision about going.

44
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,512
- I was going great. I was with it.
- Aw, Jervis...

45
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,518
it's beyond my understanding
how a man...

46
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,282
who holds the controlling interest
in 34 separate corporations...

47
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:34,916
can sit all by himself wasting his time
beating these silly tom-toms!

48
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:38,553
All by myself? Listen, I have one of the finest
record collections in the country.

49
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:40,790
I play with
the very best bands.

50
00:05:40,898 --> 00:05:43,332
My father used to get up at 6:00
every morning to train...

51
00:05:43,434 --> 00:05:45,629
carrier pigeons,
most of whom never came back.

52
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:47,637
Did you consider that
childish nonsense?

53
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:51,004
- That was his hobby.
- Hobby, my foot. That's the way he got his kicks.

54
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:53,077
Now, if you don't mind,
flip that record.

55
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:55,771
- I beg your pardon?
- Flip it. Turn it, you know, over.

56
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,110
No, look, the secretary
must have your answer.

57
00:05:58,216 --> 00:06:00,844
The mission leaves tomorrow night
from Idyllwild Airport.

58
00:06:00,952 --> 00:06:03,420
- The seriousness of the problem-
- I thoroughly understand...

59
00:06:03,521 --> 00:06:05,648
the seriousness of
the French economic situation.

60
00:06:05,757 --> 00:06:07,657
Vital lag in
industrial production...

61
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,659
coal mining output
can be stepped up...

62
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:12,286
electric kilowatt hour
consumption not up to its potential.

63
00:06:12,397 --> 00:06:14,592
Even the agricultural program,
of which France...

64
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,929
has always been the European leader,
can be increased.

65
00:06:17,035 --> 00:06:20,027
Now, flip that record.

66
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:28,245
- Anything else?
- Yes. Just sit there and listen.

67
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,976
Griggs
because I hold you

68
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:36,178
In affection
and great esteem

69
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,755
I shall now begin
to instruct you in

70
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,051
What the jazz elite
call the modern beat

71
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,252
A complete anthology
of"Well, all reet"

72
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,852
<i>And how I made the team</i>

73
00:07:13,324 --> 00:07:15,224
Ah!

74
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:23,265
Ooh, ooh-
Ooh, boy.

75
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,935
Well?

76
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:07,840
What shall I tell
the State Department?

77
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,845
That we're going,
of course.

78
00:08:13,384 --> 00:08:15,511
Did you say "we"?

79
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,215
Certainly. Everyone knows you make
all my decisions for me.

80
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,054
Everybody but me!

81
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,373
Now, a little more gravel
under that wheel. That's it.

82
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:48,851
Bring the pole over here. That's it.
Now, give me some of those branches.

83
00:08:48,953 --> 00:08:52,480
<i>- Uh, may I make a suggestion?
- Mr. Pendleton, please.!</i>

84
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:56,651
Mr. Bronson happens to be our expert
in tractors and farm machinery.

85
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:59,423
If he can't get us
out of here, no one can.

86
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,930
<i>Thank you for that
vote of confidence.</i>

87
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:06,231
All ready, Sergeant.
Now, everybody, get behind and push!

88
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,771
<i>Push.! Push.!</i>

89
00:09:13,377 --> 00:09:17,541
Well, I think we finally
struck firm ground.

90
00:09:17,648 --> 00:09:20,811
I think you've struck oil.
But you can have my share.

91
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:23,443
Uh, do you mind if I go
up the road a piece...

92
00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:26,819
to see if I can find a farmhouse
or a telephone or something?

93
00:09:26,924 --> 00:09:30,792
Good, I knew you wouldn't. Uh, Griggs, why don't
you break out that last bottle of brandy?

94
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:33,659
Everybody could use a drink.
Right, Mrs. Carrington?

95
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:36,494
Well!

96
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:39,035
I don't know what the president
could've been thinking of...

97
00:09:39,136 --> 00:09:41,570
when he appointed that man
to this commission.

98
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,775
Oh!

99
00:10:06,597 --> 00:10:08,622
<i>- Bonjour.
- Bonjour, monsieur.</i>

100
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,463
<i>Est-ce que vous avez
un téléphone?</i>

101
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:15,130
<i>Un téléphone?
Allô. Allô.</i>

102
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,230
<i>Allô, monsieur.</i>

103
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:19,241
<i>Est-ce qu'il y a
quelqu'un ici...</i>

104
00:10:19,343 --> 00:10:21,311
<i>- le maître ou la maîtresse?
- Oui. La maîtresse.</i>

105
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,744
<i>- Entrez, monsieur.
- Merci.</i>

106
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,084
<i>- Attendez, monsieur, s'il vous plaît.
- Merci.</i>

107
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,578
Today we speak
only English.

108
00:11:31,682 --> 00:11:35,209
But as a reward, you may have
whatever you want for lunch.

109
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,722
- Marie.
- Ice-cream soda.

110
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,884
One ice-cream soda. One.

111
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,895
- Paul.
- A "hamburgère."

112
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:50,024
- "Burger," Paul. "Burger."
- A hamburger with chocolate sauce.

113
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:54,264
- Paul.
- Please, Julie.

114
00:11:54,372 --> 00:11:59,332
One hamburger with chocolate sauce
and three onions.

115
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:01,809
<i>Claudine-</i>

116
00:12:01,912 --> 00:12:03,880
<i>- Bubble gum.
- Bubble gum.!</i>

117
00:12:03,981 --> 00:12:07,382
Bubble gum!
Bubble gum.

118
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,661
<i>Monsieur.</i>

119
00:12:17,762 --> 00:12:20,253
<i>Bonjour, madame. Uh,
je m'appelle Pendleton.</i>

120
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:24,232
Oh, an American. How do you do,
Mr. Pendleton? I am Madame Savanne.

121
00:12:24,335 --> 00:12:26,496
Well, that takes
the strain off my French.

122
00:12:26,604 --> 00:12:29,072
Uh, I wonder,
have you a telephone?

123
00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:33,610
A telephone? Oh, no, monsieur.
Why do you need one?

124
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,679
Well, I'm with a group
of people and, uh...

125
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,647
- our car skidded off the road into a ditch.
- No!

126
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:42,048
No one's hurt. It's just that we can't
seem to get the car out.

127
00:12:42,153 --> 00:12:44,951
Uh, is there a garage nearby?

128
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,190
For whom?

129
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:51,455
The only car around here for miles is
the one that belongs to our gardener.

130
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,530
Well, your gardener has a car.
That's wonderful.

131
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,623
Oh, you should see it.
It was left here after the war.

132
00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:00,465
- Ajeep?
- Oh, no, no, no. Not that war. The one before it.

133
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,062
Oh. But still, i-it would
be better than nothing.

134
00:13:03,174 --> 00:13:05,165
I'd be very glad
to pay for the use of it.

135
00:13:05,276 --> 00:13:09,042
I think you better see it first. I will ask
the gardener to push it around in the front.

136
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:11,637
- Push it?
- Oh, only to start it.

137
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:15,446
After that-
it marches.

138
00:13:15,553 --> 00:13:18,317
Julie! Julie!

139
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,856
<i>Oui, madame?</i>

140
00:13:25,896 --> 00:13:31,027
I was watching that girl. She seems quite unusual.
Has a wonderful way with children.

141
00:13:31,135 --> 00:13:33,296
Perhaps it's because
she is one of them.

142
00:13:33,404 --> 00:13:35,804
I, myself, found her
and named her.

143
00:13:35,906 --> 00:13:38,067
- She has lived her whole 18 years here.
- Is that so?

144
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,575
Oh, but that is not getting
your car out of the ditch.

145
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:44,114
- I will fetch the gardener. He is working with the potatoes.
- Thank you.

146
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:10,438
C-A-T spells cat

147
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,533
R-A-T spells rat

148
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:17,102
Although the cat
can catch the rat

149
00:14:17,214 --> 00:14:20,183
The rat can't
catch the cat

150
00:14:20,284 --> 00:14:24,516
H-E-R spells her

151
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:27,955
F-U-R spells fur

152
00:14:28,058 --> 00:14:32,017
Just pat her fur
and listen to her

153
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:34,757
P-U-R-R, purr

154
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,132
<i>Do you see the cow</i>

155
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:44,537
<i>She is eating hay</i>

156
00:14:44,642 --> 00:14:47,076
<i>She is eating hay
to give her milk</i>

157
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,112
I have spoken
to the gardener.

158
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:51,181
<i>M- l-L-K</i>

159
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:57,184
Yes. Every once in a while one meets
a person who has it in her...

160
00:14:57,288 --> 00:15:01,247
to take life and make
something wonderful of it.

161
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,451
Seems a shame.
Oh, I don't mean...

162
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:05,586
that this isn't a wonderful
place, a good life-

163
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,164
Oh, monsieur, don't apologize.
I do my job very well...

164
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:10,233
and I know Julie
will even do it better.

165
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:13,030
- Julie what?
- Julie Andre.

166
00:15:13,137 --> 00:15:17,403
- But, uh, for a young woman to spend her
life here- Oh! - Oh, but she's so attractive.

167
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:19,806
- Surely there must be some young man who-
- Oh, yes.

168
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,401
There is the widow farmer
who needs a wife.

169
00:15:22,513 --> 00:15:27,974
He sells us our eggs every week and lately has
been giving us an extra dozen free of charge.

170
00:15:28,085 --> 00:15:33,352
I am very, very nervous. You know, we need
the eggs for the children, and yet-Aah!

171
00:15:33,457 --> 00:15:37,791
- Handkerchiefs too, huh?
- Oh-ho-ho, you have noticed our ginghams.

172
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:42,491
A little while back we were notified we were
going to receive 2,000 yards of cloth.

173
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,331
Oh, monsieur,
we were so excited!

174
00:15:46,437 --> 00:15:49,270
And then it came.

175
00:15:49,373 --> 00:15:51,364
All blue and white
checkered.

176
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:55,673
Oh, sometimes I wish charity
would not be so mechanical, so cold, so-

177
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:58,111
- So all blue and white.
- Precisely.

178
00:15:58,215 --> 00:16:01,343
<i>Oh, the car is waiting, monsieur.</i>

179
00:16:01,452 --> 00:16:04,046
- After all, that's what I came for, isn't it?
- Yes, but this car...

180
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:06,054
is not very obedient.

181
00:16:06,156 --> 00:16:09,216
You better think twice before you even get into it.

182
00:17:02,112 --> 00:17:04,376
Hi, Alec!

183
00:17:10,954 --> 00:17:14,390
Stop making noises like an ambassador,
"Alex," and answer the question.

184
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,221
How do I go about
adopting a French orphan?

185
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,455
Now, look, Jerv. You stumbled
into some orphanage.

186
00:17:19,563 --> 00:17:23,124
You're tired. You've been cooped up with
the same people for a couple of weeks now.

187
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:25,724
All of a sudden you see
the bright, shining faces...

188
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,327
of these unwanted children,
and you catch on fire.

189
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,839
Next thing I know, you arrive here
in a beat-up old jalopy...

190
00:17:30,941 --> 00:17:33,466
- you bang into my Cadillac-
- That's the only way I could stop.

191
00:17:33,577 --> 00:17:35,875
I told you that before.
The car had no brakes.

192
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:39,312
Now, let's get to it.
What red tape do we have to cut?

193
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:43,614
Jervis, even you cannot go leaping about
from country to country adopting orphans.

194
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:47,122
I am not leaping about.
It's only one country and one orphan.

195
00:17:47,224 --> 00:17:50,091
Will you please stop stalling
and get started?

196
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,220
- All right, Jervis, we can try.
- Try? Don't give me that.

197
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,356
- Any time the American ambassador can't-
- Okay, okay.

198
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:58,401
Now, what's the name
of the orphanage?

199
00:17:58,502 --> 00:18:02,939
Uh, Jeanne d'Arc,
right outside Soissons.

200
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,771
- And the child's name?
- Julie Andre.

201
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,471
A-N-D-R-E.

202
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,879
- Do you know how old she is?
- Yes. Eighteen.

203
00:18:17,988 --> 00:18:20,718
- Let's have another martini.
- Oh, Alec.

204
00:18:20,824 --> 00:18:23,156
- Oh, Jervis!
- Now, if you're gonna take that attitude...

205
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,558
- we won't get anyplace.
- Mm-hmm.

206
00:18:25,662 --> 00:18:27,687
Tell me, has she
got a friend?

207
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:29,698
This girl has
a gift for life.

208
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,826
I want to send her to America.
I want to educate her.

209
00:18:32,936 --> 00:18:36,497
You can't adopt an 18-year-old girl.
You can't ask me-

210
00:18:36,607 --> 00:18:39,007
They have a name for what
you're asking me to do.

211
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:42,340
That is narrow-minded,
bigoted and evil.

212
00:18:42,446 --> 00:18:46,382
Jervis, have you any idea how easy it is to lose
a job at the State Department these days?

213
00:18:46,483 --> 00:18:50,010
- But my motives are as pure as-
- Just a moment, Jervis. I, uh-

214
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,850
I think the ambassador fears
that if the press hear about this...

215
00:18:52,956 --> 00:18:56,153
they might conceivably place
a different interpretation...

216
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,718
upon your motives,
however pure in fact they may be.

217
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,730
- Thank you, Griggs.
- Yeah.

218
00:19:01,832 --> 00:19:05,893
Mm-hmm, fair point.
Uh, I have it.

219
00:19:06,003 --> 00:19:07,903
The entire thing
can be done anonymously...

220
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:09,973
uh, like
a scholarship fund.

221
00:19:10,073 --> 00:19:12,871
There'll be absolutely no contact
between the girl and myself.

222
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:15,604
She won't even know who I am.
The Pendleton Foundation...

223
00:19:15,712 --> 00:19:18,806
gives lots of scholarships
to American boys and girls.

224
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:22,079
Why not to this girl?
Why not?

225
00:19:22,186 --> 00:19:25,587
- I don't know why not.
- Well?

226
00:19:25,689 --> 00:19:28,123
But, of course, you're not really
adopting her in this case...

227
00:19:28,225 --> 00:19:30,853
- you're merely sponsoring her.
- Right.

228
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:34,419
But you want to send her to college.
How do we know she'll qualify?

229
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:36,999
Qualify. Um-
I'm on the board of trustees...

230
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,330
of, uh, some institution
of learning for young ladies.

231
00:19:39,436 --> 00:19:43,065
- W-W-Which one is it, Griggs?
- Walston College in Massachusetts.

232
00:19:43,173 --> 00:19:45,073
What makes you think
they'll take her?

233
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:47,507
Uh, what was our
contribution last year?

234
00:19:47,611 --> 00:19:50,045
Sizable.

235
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,047
She is now
an enrolled member...

236
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,118
of the freshman class
of Walston College in Massachusetts.

237
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:59,679
Here, start writing.
Now, uh, where were we?

238
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:03,590
"Eighteen years old."

239
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:08,193
Julie! Everything is true!
Everything is happening!

240
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:11,096
Look, here is a letter
from the American ambassador.

241
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:13,192
Your name, Julie Andre.

242
00:20:13,303 --> 00:20:17,034
You-You are going
to America to college.

243
00:20:21,645 --> 00:20:25,604
- How do I go?
- By airplane. Everything has been arranged.

244
00:20:25,716 --> 00:20:29,015
Traveling expenses,
college, clothes to wear.

245
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,418
- And the food too?
- Food, everything that you desire.

246
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,753
- Hamburger?
- Hamburger!

247
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,952
- Ice cream?
- Three times a day!

248
00:20:38,061 --> 00:20:40,359
<i>Oh! Oh la la la la.!</i>

249
00:20:40,464 --> 00:20:42,625
I will send some back
to the children and...

250
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:45,201
- pictures of Indians a-and cowboys and so.
- Oh!

251
00:20:45,302 --> 00:20:48,738
Maybe where you are going there won't be
any cowboys. Indians maybe, but not cowboys.

252
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:52,536
<i>Oh la la, m-madame.
Is not possible. Is- Is like a dream.</i>

253
00:20:52,643 --> 00:20:54,611
Is- Is-
Is too-

254
00:20:57,014 --> 00:20:59,812
Who is it that would do that for me?
What's his name? Where is he?

255
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:02,613
Oh, I cannot tell you his name.
He doesn't wish you to know it.

256
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,085
He-Why- How-
I want to thank him!

257
00:21:05,188 --> 00:21:08,385
He doesn't want any thanks!
He doesn't want any gratitude.

258
00:21:08,492 --> 00:21:11,290
His only wish is that
you write him once a month...

259
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,295
just like he would
be your father...

260
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,627
and tell him the progress
you are making in school.

261
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:19,668
And, uh,
this is the address:

262
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,965
"Mr. John Smith...

263
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,940
Post Office Box 3642,
New York City."

264
00:21:26,043 --> 00:21:30,139
It's all written out here. Of course,
Mr. John Smith is not his real name.

265
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,705
<i>Oh la la, madame.</i>

266
00:21:33,817 --> 00:21:36,547
- It- It has really happened, eh?
- Mm-hmm.

267
00:21:36,653 --> 00:21:39,520
- Is really true?
- Everything is true.

268
00:21:39,623 --> 00:21:42,922
Go on, Julie.
You go to sleep...

269
00:21:43,026 --> 00:21:46,860
and say a nice
prayer of thanks, huh?

270
00:21:48,398 --> 00:21:50,593
<i>- O-Oh, oh!
- Merci, madame.</i>

271
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:59,041
<i>- Oh, how beautiful it is!
- It is an American automobile.</i>

272
00:21:59,142 --> 00:22:02,543
<i>- No, no, it is Italian.
- It is not. It's a Cadillac.</i>

273
00:22:02,646 --> 00:22:05,877
- We saw one in the cinema.
- Shh! Kids, what are you doing there?

274
00:22:05,983 --> 00:22:09,749
There is an American automobile with a man.
He has been talking to Emile.

275
00:22:09,853 --> 00:22:12,219
Where? Let me see.

276
00:22:17,661 --> 00:22:19,993
<i>Oh, zut.!</i>

277
00:22:20,097 --> 00:22:23,191
- Did you see him? Did you see his face?
- Yes, I saw him.

278
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,632
You did?
What did he look like?

279
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:29,866
- Was he old?
- Oh, yes, very old.

280
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,873
- How old?
- Older than him.

281
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:34,808
Oh! Did you see his hair?
What kind of hair did he have?

282
00:22:34,911 --> 00:22:36,879
- No hair.
- Bald?

283
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,848
- Maybe. He wore a hat.
- We saw only a shadow.

284
00:22:40,951 --> 00:22:43,920
He was very thin and very tall.
Very long legs.

285
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:46,387
<i>- Comme un faucheux.
- Un faucheux?</i>

286
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,050
<i>Yes, a faucheux.
A daddy longlegs.</i>

287
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,218
Oh, a daddy longlegs!

288
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:54,559
Yes, a daddy longlegs!

289
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:57,429
Shh. Now, off to bed,
quickly. Be very quiet.

290
00:22:57,534 --> 00:22:59,798
Don't wake up the others.

291
00:23:55,525 --> 00:23:58,517
Daddy Longlegs.

292
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:05,001
<i>Papa faucheux.</i>

293
00:24:08,538 --> 00:24:12,998
<i>Daddy Longlegs</i>

294
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:17,706
<i>Daddy Longlegs</i>

295
00:24:17,814 --> 00:24:20,681
<i>Pretty please make</i>

296
00:24:20,784 --> 00:24:24,618
<i>My little dream come true</i>

297
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:27,315
<i>Daddy Longlegs</i>

298
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,985
<i>If Cinderella's godmama</i>

299
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:35,258
<i>Could make her
coach and four</i>

300
00:24:35,365 --> 00:24:39,825
<i>I'm sure a real-live godpapa</i>

301
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:45,670
<i>Could do
a whole lot more</i>

302
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:50,509
<i>Make me pretty</i>

303
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:54,744
<i>Make me witty</i>

304
00:24:54,851 --> 00:24:58,685
<i>Make mejust as nice</i>

305
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:04,421
<i>As a girl can be</i>

306
00:25:04,528 --> 00:25:09,898
<i>Don't know how
I'll find a way</i>

307
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,564
<i>But I'll pay you
back someday</i>

308
00:25:16,673 --> 00:25:22,475
<i>Daddy Longlegs</i>

309
00:25:22,579 --> 00:25:28,518
<i>Wait and see</i>

310
00:25:37,727 --> 00:25:40,127
Julie, Julie.

311
00:26:30,146 --> 00:26:35,584
<i>Daddy Longlegs</i>

312
00:26:35,685 --> 00:26:41,624
<i>Wait and see</i>

313
00:27:31,841 --> 00:27:33,866
That'll be
a dollar and a half.

314
00:27:46,256 --> 00:27:48,383
Keep the change, please.

315
00:27:48,491 --> 00:27:50,391
Thank you.

316
00:27:59,936 --> 00:28:02,769
- Hi!
- Hi!

317
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:07,904
Through those portals, sister.

318
00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:10,502
See ya.

319
00:28:10,613 --> 00:28:12,513
See ya.

320
00:28:16,953 --> 00:28:18,853
- Hi!
- Hi there.

321
00:28:18,955 --> 00:28:20,923
- Hi.
- Hi!

322
00:28:21,024 --> 00:28:22,924
Frosh?

323
00:28:23,026 --> 00:28:26,792
- Pardon?
- Freshman. Are you a freshman?

324
00:28:26,896 --> 00:28:29,194
<i>Oui. Uh, yes.
I'm a freshman.</i>

325
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:32,166
Well, you must be our
French girl, Julie Andre.

326
00:28:32,268 --> 00:28:35,169
Oh. You know
about me, huh?

327
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:37,899
Yes, I have a list of everybody
and where they come from.

328
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:42,968
I'm Pat Whithers, senior.
Welcome to Walston College.

329
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:45,240
Thank you.

330
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:49,182
You're in Room 205 with Linda Pendleton
and Sally McBride.

331
00:28:49,285 --> 00:28:51,776
Right up the stairs
and down the hall to your left.

332
00:28:51,888 --> 00:28:54,083
Thank you, Miss Senior.

333
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,388
Egghead! Egghead!

334
00:28:59,496 --> 00:29:02,590
Egghead!

335
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,690
Egghead!
Hit it, mama!

336
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:07,031
<i>- Okay.!
- Come on, everybody.</i>

337
00:29:07,137 --> 00:29:10,937
Welcome, egghead
Wipe that smile off your face

338
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:14,977
Never speak
until you're spoken to

339
00:29:15,078 --> 00:29:18,946
What an egghead
You're an egghead

340
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:22,917
But you're soon
gonna be hard-boiled

341
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:27,547
Blow your nose, dry your ears
Get up and salute when a senior appears

342
00:29:27,657 --> 00:29:29,557
Move your feet
Get out the lead

343
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:31,593
Put a hat on to cover
the point on your head

344
00:29:31,694 --> 00:29:35,494
Tummy in, sweater out
And eliminate that supercilious pout

345
00:29:35,598 --> 00:29:38,897
But since you are a lady, dear
you're very welcome here

346
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:42,904
Welcome, egghead
You're an egghead

347
00:29:43,006 --> 00:29:46,498
But you're soon
gonna be hard-boiled

348
00:29:46,609 --> 00:29:49,043
- Oh! Oh, pardon.
- Excuse me.

349
00:29:49,145 --> 00:29:52,273
Hi. I'm Sally McBride.
This is Linda Pendleton.

350
00:29:52,382 --> 00:29:56,079
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi, Miss Pendleton. I am Julie Andre.

351
00:29:56,186 --> 00:30:00,122
We've heard about you. We're both signing up
for French and we expect to get straight A's.

352
00:30:00,223 --> 00:30:04,990
You know, I'd help you with English,
but I'm a total loss at it myself. I smell.

353
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:07,063
Oh! You do?

354
00:30:07,163 --> 00:30:09,063
- At English.
- Oh!

355
00:30:09,165 --> 00:30:12,692
However, I have got a brother
at Harvard who's real smooth.

356
00:30:12,802 --> 00:30:15,771
So if I were you, I'd cultivate me.
You better cultivate Linda too...

357
00:30:15,872 --> 00:30:18,136
because her folks are big
muck-a-mucks around here.

358
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:21,540
Every time you need a new building or
something, her uncle coughs up the mazuma.

359
00:30:21,644 --> 00:30:25,944
Oh, pipe down, Sally. Look, have we said
anything that you can understand yet?

360
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:30,247
Well, most of the words, yes,
but the meaning, l-

361
00:30:30,353 --> 00:30:32,913
- I thought so.
- Don't worry. You'll get with it.

362
00:30:33,022 --> 00:30:35,013
Uh, one of us has to sleep
in a room by herself.

363
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,252
Would it bother you
if you slept alone?

364
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,295
Alone?
A bedroom for myself?

365
00:30:40,396 --> 00:30:43,229
Oh, no. No, no, that would
not bother me at all.

366
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:46,791
Good, then that's settled.
Now, uh, where's your trunk?

367
00:30:46,903 --> 00:30:49,531
Uh, l- I don't know.

368
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,766
What do you mean you don't know?
Didn't you pack?

369
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:55,868
Oh, yes, but, uh-
All I packed was this.

370
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,140
She's smart.
She believes in traveling light.

371
00:30:58,248 --> 00:31:01,684
Well, surely those aren't all the clothes
you have for the whole year, are they?

372
00:31:01,784 --> 00:31:05,311
<i>I don't know. Uh-</i>

373
00:31:05,421 --> 00:31:07,719
Uh, come in.

374
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,019
Miss, uh, Julie Andre?

375
00:31:10,126 --> 00:31:12,617
<i>- Yes, that's me.
- We got a couple of trunks for you.</i>

376
00:31:12,729 --> 00:31:14,629
Oh!

377
00:31:16,933 --> 00:31:18,833
- Okay.
- Oh-

378
00:31:20,103 --> 00:31:23,095
- Oh, you-
- If I didn't-

379
00:31:23,206 --> 00:31:27,506
Good night!
Why, I've never seen anything so big.

380
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,510
- Oh, Julie.
- I don't believe it.

381
00:31:29,612 --> 00:31:31,512
- Miss Andre?
- Yes?

382
00:31:31,614 --> 00:31:33,514
Will you sign here, please?

383
00:31:33,616 --> 00:31:35,641
- And you were the girl who didn't have any trunks?
- Here?

384
00:31:35,752 --> 00:31:37,947
- Yes, please.
- Oh, and she believes in traveling light.

385
00:31:38,054 --> 00:31:40,022
Oh!

386
00:31:40,123 --> 00:31:42,216
Look at them-
at two of them.

387
00:31:42,325 --> 00:31:44,225
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

388
00:31:44,327 --> 00:31:48,058
- Well, come on! Aren't you gonna open them?
- Open them!

389
00:31:48,164 --> 00:31:51,463
Ooh, yes. Yes.

390
00:31:51,568 --> 00:31:53,934
- Hurry.
- Well, uh-They are locked.

391
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,164
Well, of course they're locked!
Where are the keys?

392
00:31:56,272 --> 00:31:58,433
Oh, uh-
Oh, the keys!

393
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,566
- The keys!
- Of course, the keys.

394
00:32:00,677 --> 00:32:03,475
Oh, well, uh, I am tired
of saying I do not know...

395
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,447
but I do not know.

396
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,916
Well, look, we'll try my nail file.
It works great on my sister's diary.

397
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:11,919
- Yes?
- Julie?

398
00:32:12,021 --> 00:32:13,921
- Yes?
- This just arrived, special delivery.

399
00:32:14,023 --> 00:32:16,457
- Oh, thank you.
- Now, don't get used to this kind of service.

400
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,527
- It's only the first day.
- The keys!

401
00:32:18,628 --> 00:32:20,528
- I think it's the keys.
- See if you're right.

402
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:24,464
- There they are. There they are!
- Will you come on? Hurry up.

403
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,558
- I am.
- Hurry! I have a strange feeling...

404
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:28,899
I'm gonna be
the best-dressed girl on campus.

405
00:32:29,005 --> 00:32:32,566
- Oh!
- Oh, my heavens. Look at them, will ya?

406
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:35,906
Oh!

407
00:32:36,012 --> 00:32:38,572
- Oh, wow!
- Wow!

408
00:32:38,681 --> 00:32:40,581
- Wow!
- Oh!

409
00:32:40,683 --> 00:32:45,985
- Whoo! Ooh.
- Oh, get a load of these labels.

410
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,649
<i>- It's from my guardian.
- Are you sure he's your guardian?</i>

411
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,658
Oh, yes,
that I do know.

412
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,786
- Oh, there's so many of them.
- Oh! Ooh, here it is.

413
00:32:53,896 --> 00:32:56,364
- What? Oh.
- They're beautiful.

414
00:32:56,466 --> 00:32:59,492
- Oh, this is the one that I like.
- Oh.

415
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:02,127
- Pardon. Yes, I'll be back.
- Isn't this a beauty?

416
00:33:02,238 --> 00:33:05,901
Look, Linda. You know,
if I lose about five pounds-

417
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:08,978
- I can step right into this one.
- Oh, that's beautiful.

418
00:33:09,078 --> 00:33:12,013
- How did he know my eyes were blue, the darling?
- Julie?

419
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:15,676
Julie, I'll swap you a date with my brother
for a chance to wear this dress.

420
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,685
<i>- Eh?
- Swell, it's a deal.</i>

421
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,982
- There's still some more in there.
- Oh, my heavens, look-

422
00:33:20,089 --> 00:33:22,319
- Oh, I've never seen so many.
- Aren't they beautiful?

423
00:33:22,425 --> 00:33:24,325
- Sally?
- What?

424
00:33:24,427 --> 00:33:26,327
Sally, do you think
he's really her guardian?

425
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:28,522
- Huh?
- Well, I don't care what his intentions are.

426
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:31,225
His taste is divine.

427
00:33:31,334 --> 00:33:33,996
<i>- Julie? Julie?
- Coming.!</i>

428
00:33:35,538 --> 00:33:39,770
Eh, behold-
an American "froshman."

429
00:33:41,878 --> 00:33:43,903
Oh, you look-

430
00:33:44,013 --> 00:33:45,913
Look!

431
00:33:56,259 --> 00:33:58,250
"Dear Daddy Longlegs...

432
00:33:58,361 --> 00:34:01,023
"or perhaps I should say-
Dear kind person...

433
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,724
who sends orphans
to college."

434
00:34:08,705 --> 00:34:12,141
Yesterday morning...

435
00:34:12,241 --> 00:34:15,870
I was in France.

436
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:21,582
And tonight...

437
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,584
I am...

438
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:27,315
sleeping in...

439
00:34:27,423 --> 00:34:30,449
Massach-

440
00:34:36,766 --> 00:34:39,462
Walston.

441
00:34:39,569 --> 00:34:42,868
"It is strange to be writing letters
to somebody you don't know.

442
00:34:42,972 --> 00:34:46,635
"It is very strange for me
to be writing letters at all.

443
00:34:46,743 --> 00:34:49,234
"Never before had I
anyone to write to.

444
00:34:49,345 --> 00:34:52,280
But now I belo-"

445
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:56,113
"But now I belong
to somebody...

446
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,154
"and it is a very
comfortable sensation.

447
00:34:59,255 --> 00:35:01,621
"I will try
to make you proud of me.

448
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:06,058
Yours very respectfully,
Julie."

449
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:11,026
Is, uh, Mr. Pendleton
to see this?

450
00:35:11,134 --> 00:35:13,432
No. No, Miss Pritchard.
Just start a new file.

451
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,164
"Andre." "Julie Andre."

452
00:35:16,272 --> 00:35:18,172
Yes, Mr. Griggs.

453
00:36:44,894 --> 00:36:47,829
"Dear Daddy Longlegs, I doubt
that it will interest you...

454
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:50,558
"but this semester
I have moved up two places.

455
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:53,157
"I am now 12th
in my class.

456
00:36:53,269 --> 00:36:56,830
My average is just above a 'B'."

457
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,469
Griggs speaking. Yes.

458
00:37:02,912 --> 00:37:07,815
Oh, she is?
Uh, just a moment.

459
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:11,444
- Yes, Griggs, old boy. - Jervis, your
sister-in-law, Gertrude, is on the phone.

460
00:37:11,554 --> 00:37:13,852
I just left
for Alaska.

461
00:37:13,956 --> 00:37:15,924
She's called five times.

462
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,993
It's about your house
at Murray Bay.

463
00:37:18,094 --> 00:37:20,119
She's decided to spend
the summer there with Linda.

464
00:37:20,229 --> 00:37:23,562
She wants you to have
it redecorated. French provincial.

465
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:26,328
She wants me to have
my house redecorated...

466
00:37:26,435 --> 00:37:29,063
- so she can use it for her vacation?
- Yes.

467
00:37:29,171 --> 00:37:31,469
For Gertrude, it seems
a fairly reasonable request.

468
00:37:31,574 --> 00:37:34,099
Well, you can tell my
sister-in-law she can-

469
00:37:36,078 --> 00:37:38,046
Uh, tell Mrs. Pendleton
Mr. Pendleton...

470
00:37:38,147 --> 00:37:41,310
will be very happy
to have her use the house.

471
00:37:41,417 --> 00:37:45,148
Yes, he agrees with her that French
provincial should be most attractive.

472
00:37:45,254 --> 00:37:49,452
He wonders why he didn't
think of it himself. Yeah.

473
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,660
Now, where was I?

474
00:37:52,762 --> 00:37:55,196
"My average
is just above a 'B'."

475
00:37:55,298 --> 00:37:58,267
- What?
- The Andre letter.

476
00:37:58,367 --> 00:38:00,267
Oh.

477
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:03,471
Uh, file it.

478
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,803
You didn't finish
reading it!

479
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:12,779
"It is very hard to go on
writing to a- a thing.

480
00:38:12,882 --> 00:38:17,182
"You never answer my questions. You never
show the slightest interest in anything I do.

481
00:38:17,286 --> 00:38:19,686
"You don't praise,
and you don't scold.

482
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:22,349
"It's like having
a machine for a father.

483
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:24,688
"I love college,
and I love you for sending me...

484
00:38:24,794 --> 00:38:29,322
"but couldn't you write
just one letter?

485
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:33,664
Not too respectfully yours,
Julie."

486
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:38,433
- File it, Miss Pritchard.
- Isn't somebody, someday going to answer that poor child?

487
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:41,476
All right, all right!

488
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:45,945
Dear Miss Andre...

489
00:38:46,048 --> 00:38:48,039
your letter
of the 23rd received.

490
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,414
Mr. Smith's attention
will be called to your progress.

491
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:53,044
I'm sure he'll be pleased
with the report. Very truly yours.

492
00:38:53,155 --> 00:38:56,955
That's a cheerful, breezy little note.
I'm sure that'll warm her up!

493
00:38:57,059 --> 00:38:59,527
What do I know about
writing to a young girl?

494
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:03,030
All right, destroy my letter.
Continue the old arrangement. File it under "A."

495
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,157
Yes, Mr. Griggs.

496
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:10,397
Mr. Griggs!

497
00:39:10,506 --> 00:39:13,532
A person is not a corporation.

498
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:18,171
A person is- is, uh,
flesh and- and blood and-

499
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,180
and feelings!

500
00:39:48,577 --> 00:39:50,909
<i>On slide three,
I don't like the word "coach."</i>

501
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:54,005
Pendleton Airways is selling something
better than coach travel.

502
00:39:54,116 --> 00:39:56,710
We must find a new phrase.
Yes, Griggs.

503
00:39:56,819 --> 00:39:58,946
- Jervis, a person is not a corporation.
- Really?

504
00:39:59,055 --> 00:40:01,615
Uh, "Cabin Clipper"just occurred to me.
How does that strike you?

505
00:40:01,724 --> 00:40:04,989
A person is flesh and blood and feelings
and has to be treated as such.

506
00:40:05,094 --> 00:40:07,722
- I'll vote for that. Where do I register?
- Your treatment of her...

507
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:10,663
- has been absolutely shameful.
- She's a monster.

508
00:40:10,766 --> 00:40:13,929
Sometimes I think my poor brother gave up
the ghost just to get away from her.

509
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:17,904
Not your sister-in-law.
I am referring to Miss Julie Andre.

510
00:40:18,007 --> 00:40:22,034
- Miss Julie Andre?
- Oh, I'm not in the least surprised!

511
00:40:22,144 --> 00:40:24,578
- Yes, sir?
- Miss Pritchard, bring in that file.

512
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,548
- Which file, Mr. Griggs?
- The one you've been crying into.

513
00:40:28,651 --> 00:40:31,017
Crying in the file?
Not only does it sound inefficient...

514
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,020
it sounds like a tune
on the hit parade.

515
00:40:33,122 --> 00:40:35,022
Say, what's going on
around here?

516
00:40:35,124 --> 00:40:37,649
Nothing is going on around here,
and it's all your fault!

517
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,729
Over two years ago,
you impulsively, capriciously...

518
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:44,197
against the better judgment
of the American ambassador and myself...

519
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,291
picked a young girl
out of a French orphanage...

520
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,838
and deposited her
in Walston College.

521
00:40:49,939 --> 00:40:53,500
- Oh, thatJulie Andre.
- Yes, thatJulie Andre!

522
00:40:53,609 --> 00:40:56,442
She's been kicked out!
Griggs, how could you let this happen...

523
00:40:56,545 --> 00:40:59,207
- after all we do for that college?
- She has not been kicked out.

524
00:40:59,315 --> 00:41:01,215
She stands 12th
in her class.

525
00:41:01,317 --> 00:41:05,344
She's a lovely, sensitive, marvelous girl,
one that any parent should be proud of.

526
00:41:05,454 --> 00:41:08,617
And yet, no one pays
the slightest bit of attention to her.

527
00:41:12,695 --> 00:41:16,461
- Thank you, Miss Pritchard.
- Thank you, Mr. Griggs.

528
00:41:28,144 --> 00:41:30,578
For a moment I was afraid
there was a baby in it.

529
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:33,147
- What kind of a performance was that?
- For more than two years...

530
00:41:33,249 --> 00:41:36,412
that poor girl has been pouring her heart out
to you in those letters.

531
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:38,419
And you haven't
answered one of them.

532
00:41:38,521 --> 00:41:40,751
You haven't even
bothered to read one!

533
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:44,451
Now, wait a minute.
That was the arrangement.

534
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,461
l-lt had to be done anonymously,
remember? Alec insisted upon that.

535
00:41:47,563 --> 00:41:51,966
At least you could've asked about her.
Shown some compassion, some humanity.

536
00:41:52,067 --> 00:41:54,831
Hmm. Oh, I see.

537
00:41:54,937 --> 00:41:57,167
I see.
You're in love with her.

538
00:41:57,273 --> 00:41:59,798
Y- No, Jervis, it's
much worse than that.

539
00:41:59,909 --> 00:42:02,139
- She's in love with you.
- Y-What?

540
00:42:02,244 --> 00:42:05,543
Although you don't know it, you've been
a thoughtful and considerate guardian.

541
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:08,708
She spent the last two summers
on your farm in Nova Scotia.

542
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:11,184
Although she thinks
Linda's responsible for that.

543
00:42:11,287 --> 00:42:13,221
- Linda?
- Your niece.

544
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:16,985
Gertrude's daughter. The one
you haven't seen since she was born.

545
00:42:17,092 --> 00:42:19,583
- Oh, yes. Horrible looking baby.
- Well, she's no longer...

546
00:42:19,695 --> 00:42:22,630
a horrible looking baby,
and she's Julie's roommate.

547
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:24,665
- Who put them together?
- You did.

548
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:29,466
It was the only way you could arrange for Miss
Andre's summer vacations without causing talk.

549
00:42:29,572 --> 00:42:32,063
And last Christmas,
you sent her a nice present.

550
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:36,042
- I did? What?
- Three pairs of... silk pajamas.

551
00:42:36,145 --> 00:42:39,603
- Griggs-
- All right. Miss Pritchard selected them.

552
00:42:39,715 --> 00:42:42,240
All in all, Miss Andre
has a lot to thank you for...

553
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,581
and she's very
devoted to you.

554
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,053
She calls you her
"Dear Daddy Longlegs."

555
00:42:47,156 --> 00:42:49,056
Y-
"Dear Daddy What-legs?"

556
00:42:49,158 --> 00:42:51,956
Well, it has something to do with
your shadow crawling on the wall...

557
00:42:52,061 --> 00:42:55,588
- or a spider, uh, uh-
- Oh.

558
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:59,600
- Jervis, I think you'd better read these letters.
- I think I better read 'em too.

559
00:43:05,007 --> 00:43:08,067
"Dear Daddy Longlegs."
Hmm.

560
00:43:08,177 --> 00:43:10,577
Hmm, she's a prolific
little thing, isn't she?

561
00:43:13,682 --> 00:43:16,617
Uh, Griggs, uh, w-will you
tell Miss Pritchard...

562
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,745
to hold all my calls
until she hears from me?

563
00:43:38,307 --> 00:43:42,403
<i>Dear Daddy Longlegs,
you never answered my questions...</i>

564
00:43:42,511 --> 00:43:45,207
<i>and they were
very important.</i>

565
00:43:45,314 --> 00:43:47,544
<i>Are you very bald?</i>

566
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:50,016
<i>Orjust a little bald?</i>

567
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:52,019
<i>Are you very old?</i>

568
00:43:52,121 --> 00:43:54,954
<i>Orjust a little old?</i>

569
00:43:55,057 --> 00:43:57,491
<i>Oh, well, on second thought,
please don't answer.</i>

570
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,426
<i>Not that you will.
It is just as much fun...</i>

571
00:44:00,529 --> 00:44:02,861
<i>not knowing
anything about you.</i>

572
00:44:02,965 --> 00:44:06,298
<i>It leaves me free to imagine
whatever I want.</i>

573
00:44:06,402 --> 00:44:08,927
<i>You could be anything.</i>

574
00:44:09,038 --> 00:44:12,474
<i>Sometimes I think
that you are...</i>

575
00:44:12,574 --> 00:44:15,168
<i>a Texas millionaire.</i>

576
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:18,735
<i>That's what you are.
And you are so rich...</i>

577
00:44:18,847 --> 00:44:21,975
<i>that there is a special department
in the United States Treasury...</i>

578
00:44:22,084 --> 00:44:25,419
<i>which works only on
your income tax report.</i>

579
00:45:15,204 --> 00:45:18,469
<i>Down in Texas
where the stars are bright</i>

580
00:45:18,574 --> 00:45:22,066
<i>Down in Texas where they treat you right</i>

581
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:25,578
<i>Everybody sings
this little song</i>

582
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:29,208
<i>Daddy, Daddy
why's your legs so long</i>

583
00:45:29,318 --> 00:45:32,651
<i>Love your figure
'cause it's so corn-fed</i>

584
00:45:32,755 --> 00:45:36,282
<i>Love that hair
upon your pumpkin head</i>

585
00:45:36,392 --> 00:45:39,657
<i>- Though you're richer than Vanderbilt
- Yoo-hoo!</i>

586
00:45:39,762 --> 00:45:42,230
<i>Daddy, Daddy
where'd you get them stilts</i>

587
00:45:42,331 --> 00:45:44,799
<i>Now, chicken in the bread pan
pickin'up dough</i>

588
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,959
<i>Stick out your hen
and pick out your rooster</i>

589
00:45:47,069 --> 00:45:49,594
<i>First prize is a block of stocks
Second prize is Fort Knox</i>

590
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,502
<i>Let me introduce
that dancing fool</i>

591
00:45:51,607 --> 00:45:53,370
<i>Long-leg Tex
with the big, fat wallet</i>

592
00:45:53,475 --> 00:45:55,204
<i>Wait'll he starts
to walk the dog</i>

593
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:57,244
<i>He'll bug out your eyes
like a stomped-on frog</i>

594
00:45:57,346 --> 00:45:59,246
<i>Alouette left
and Alouette right</i>

595
00:45:59,348 --> 00:46:01,612
<i>Parlez-vous
and "FrèreJacques"</i>

596
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,617
<i>Both feet up
Make a hole in the ground</i>

597
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,619
<i>Hands up high
and the gents go under</i>

598
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,621
<i>Grab your gal
and swing her like thunder</i>

599
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,624
<i>Kiss her once andjump forjoy
Kiss her twice-</i>

600
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:14,996
<i>Well, maybe not.</i>

601
00:46:15,097 --> 00:46:19,193
<i>You're probably
an international playboy.</i>

602
00:47:35,043 --> 00:47:39,810
<i>No, no, no, no, no.!
l- I don't like you like this.</i>

603
00:47:39,915 --> 00:47:42,213
<i>I prefer
to think of you...</i>

604
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,251
<i>as my guardian angel.</i>

605
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,407
<i>Oh, it's very confusing.</i>

606
00:52:09,351 --> 00:52:11,342
<i>I wish I knew
who you really are.</i>

607
00:52:11,453 --> 00:52:15,583
<i>I wish- I wish one day
you would write and tell me.</i>

608
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:18,716
<i>Your lonesome... Julie.</i>

609
00:52:32,307 --> 00:52:34,775
Will you get my sister-in-law
on the phone, please?

610
00:52:34,876 --> 00:52:38,403
- Who, sir?
- My sister-in-law, Gertrude Pendleton.

611
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:44,318
Oh.

612
00:52:50,725 --> 00:52:53,159
Hello.

613
00:52:53,261 --> 00:52:55,695
Hello, Gertrude.
Tell me. How's Linda?

614
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:58,095
Who is this?

615
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,168
Jervis?

616
00:53:00,268 --> 00:53:02,634
I don't believe it.
You've been drinking.

617
00:53:02,737 --> 00:53:06,639
No, no. Not a drop. l- I merely called up
to find out about my niece.

618
00:53:06,741 --> 00:53:08,971
Uh, tell me.
How is she enjoying college?

619
00:53:09,077 --> 00:53:12,069
Jervis, this is very peculiar.

620
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:16,139
Linda is 20 years old, and you haven't
seen her for more than 19 and a half.

621
00:53:16,251 --> 00:53:18,515
Oh, you're so right.
You're so right, Gertrude.

622
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:21,589
l- I've been the worst
of all possible uncles. I'm sorry.

623
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:24,784
Uh, say. How about you and me
driving up to see her?

624
00:53:24,893 --> 00:53:27,987
But this is insane. All I wanted you to do
is writeJulie a letter.

625
00:53:28,096 --> 00:53:30,326
Will you keep quiet?
No, no, no. Not you, Gertrude.

626
00:53:30,432 --> 00:53:34,732
l- l-There's a mechanical device
here that produces strange noises.

627
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:39,239
Uh, w-
Uh, spring dance? Saturday?

628
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,502
Oh. Sounds charming.

629
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:44,340
Fine. Uh, we'll
drive up together.

630
00:53:44,446 --> 00:53:48,075
Wonderful. Wonderful.
See you then. Good-bye.

631
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:52,142
But you can't do this. You can't go to
the school and reveal yourself to that girl.

632
00:53:52,254 --> 00:53:54,245
It's violating your-
your promise to Alec.

633
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:57,655
Griggs, how you do carry on.
I have no intention of revealing myself.

634
00:53:57,759 --> 00:53:59,784
I'm simply going up there
to visit my niece.

635
00:53:59,895 --> 00:54:02,386
And while I'm there,
I'll get a look at my orphan.

636
00:54:02,497 --> 00:54:04,988
<i>But-</i>

637
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,068
<i>Mrs. Gertrude Pendleton on the phone.</i>

638
00:54:07,168 --> 00:54:09,136
Put her on.

639
00:54:09,237 --> 00:54:11,467
Yes, Gertie.

640
00:54:11,573 --> 00:54:14,133
Why, of course it was me
you were talking to a moment ago.

641
00:54:14,242 --> 00:54:17,973
Who else? Who else
but Linda's UncleJervis?

642
00:55:10,966 --> 00:55:13,935
Oh, Jervis, please remember
that you're with me and don't leer.

643
00:55:14,035 --> 00:55:16,333
I wasn't leering.
I was just looking around.

644
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:18,906
I hope you'll remember,
they are very young.

645
00:55:19,007 --> 00:55:23,273
Time cannot wither nor custom stale
your infinite charm, Gertrude.

646
00:55:23,378 --> 00:55:26,609
I don't know what wild plans you have,
Jervis, but I don't propose to-

647
00:55:26,715 --> 00:55:28,649
- Ah, here comes Linda.
- Oh!

648
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:31,184
Linda, darling.
Can you ever forgive your UncleJervis?

649
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:34,687
- For heaven's sake, Jervis. That's not Linda.
- Oh, I am sorry.

650
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:37,519
<i>- What in the world are you doing here anyway? Linda, dear.
- Mother.</i>

651
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:40,789
I don't suppose you remember your UncleJervis,
but that's perfectly all right.

652
00:55:40,895 --> 00:55:43,693
- He doesn't remember you either.
- Hello, UncleJervis.

653
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:46,961
Linda, dear. I-I've been very foolish
in not coming to see you more often.

654
00:55:47,068 --> 00:55:49,593
- You're lovely.
- Why, thank you.

655
00:55:49,704 --> 00:55:53,470
Mm-hmm. Well, I guess
I haven't made a mistake.

656
00:55:53,575 --> 00:55:55,475
- What?
- Well, I took the liberty of-

657
00:55:55,577 --> 00:55:58,944
- That is, the girls insisted I fill out a dance card for you.
- Sounds charming.

658
00:55:59,047 --> 00:56:01,106
So if you just go
and stand under your initial...

659
00:56:01,216 --> 00:56:03,810
you'll be claimed like
a piece of luggage at an airport.

660
00:56:03,918 --> 00:56:06,011
A well-traveled piece of luggage.

661
00:56:06,121 --> 00:56:08,988
Linda, dear, do I have the pleasure
of a dance with your mother?

662
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:13,117
- Why, no. Oh, I mean- Well, it never occurred
to me when l- - My, my. Isn't it a shame?

663
00:56:13,228 --> 00:56:15,321
Well, here I go.

664
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:17,489
- Come off it, McBride.
- You can't keep her to yourself.

665
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,228
Sorry, boys. I gave up one dance to
somebody's uncle, and that's as far as I'll go.

666
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:24,737
- I beg your pardon, Professor.
- That's quite all right, fella. Quite all right.

667
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:28,639
Only I don't happen
to be a... professor.

668
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,973
- Mr. McBride.
- Yes, Miss Andre.

669
00:56:34,082 --> 00:56:37,313
- I believe this is our dance.
- Thank you, ma'am. Pardon us, Professor.

670
00:56:37,419 --> 00:56:39,785
I told you
I was not a prof-

671
00:56:39,888 --> 00:56:41,856
- Oh, you must be UncleJervis.
- Oh.

672
00:56:41,956 --> 00:56:44,948
- Well, I'm Sally McBride, Linda's roommate.
- I thought Linda's roommate was-

673
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,359
Oh. You mean the vision of loveliness
that just danced off with my brother?

674
00:56:48,463 --> 00:56:51,091
Well, that's Julie Andre.
She's the third cell mate.

675
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,133
Oh, I see.

676
00:56:53,234 --> 00:56:56,761
- Well, uh, shall we have a go at it?
- Why, uh-

677
00:56:56,871 --> 00:57:00,238
Of course, if this is too bluesy for you,
we could sit this one out.

678
00:57:00,341 --> 00:57:03,276
- Well, I'll do my best.
- All right.

679
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:07,439
- I, uh- I can do the box step.
- Oh.

680
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:10,541
One, two. One, two.

681
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:16,088
Well, you're quite good.

682
00:57:16,191 --> 00:57:18,785
Thank you. I'm glad those lessons
weren't a complete waste.

683
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:21,987
- Oh.
- Last week they put me on Spanish rhythms.

684
00:57:38,379 --> 00:57:42,008
Hmm. Mr. McBride seems to be
quite taken with Miss Andre.

685
00:57:42,117 --> 00:57:46,019
Taken? He's Georgia,
and she's Sherman marching through.

686
00:57:46,121 --> 00:57:49,784
- Uh, she the same way about him?
- She'd be a darn fool if she weren't.

687
00:57:49,891 --> 00:57:51,859
Hmm.

688
00:58:02,003 --> 00:58:05,166
- Am I leading?
- Well, up to now, I think it's a tie.

689
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:08,470
That's a fault of mine.
It comes of going to a girls' school.

690
00:58:14,149 --> 00:58:16,140
- Well, that's that.
- Thanks a lot.

691
00:58:16,251 --> 00:58:19,084
Oh, and, uh, you won't forget.
Tomorrow afternoon we're playing Vassar.

692
00:58:19,187 --> 00:58:22,384
- I do hope you can be there.
- Good luck. Although I'm sure you could beat Yale.

693
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:24,458
Why, thank you!

694
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:40,372
Mr. Pendleton?
I am Julie Andre.

695
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:42,909
How do you do?
Is this our dance?

696
00:58:43,011 --> 00:58:46,447
Yes. If you'd rather
not dance, we can talk.

697
00:58:46,548 --> 00:58:50,314
Oh, I think I'd like that. Isn't there,
uh, someplace we could go?

698
00:58:50,418 --> 00:58:53,854
In the garden perhaps? Or maybe that
would be bad for your reputation.

699
00:58:53,955 --> 00:58:56,685
Uh, it would.

700
00:58:56,791 --> 00:59:00,283
Come on. Let's destroy my reputation.

701
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:07,529
Spring is in the air,
isn't it?

702
00:59:07,635 --> 00:59:09,660
Yes. Isn't it?

703
00:59:17,645 --> 00:59:21,706
Now, uh, where do you suggest
we have our flirtation?

704
00:59:21,816 --> 00:59:24,444
Well, one usually
goes that way.

705
00:59:28,756 --> 00:59:32,089
- Tell me. Haven't we met somewhere before?
- No.

706
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:35,321
That sounds like what the boys
usually say, but haven't we?

707
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:39,025
No. No. l- I'm sure
I would have remembered.

708
00:59:39,133 --> 00:59:41,829
I have the funniest feeling-

709
00:59:41,936 --> 00:59:43,927
- Of course. I know. Come on.
- Where?

710
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:46,199
- You'll see.
- Oh!

711
00:59:46,307 --> 00:59:49,470
I'm sorry. I beg your pardon.
I was just, uh-

712
00:59:49,577 --> 00:59:53,343
- Miss Andre, where are you taking me?
- You'll see.

713
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:57,718
There you are.

714
00:59:57,819 --> 01:00:00,014
<i>Grandfather.!</i>

715
01:00:00,121 --> 01:00:05,058
What a wonderful way to end his days:
in the middle of a girls' school.

716
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:08,651
Ah. Did he have
a weakness for ladies?

717
01:00:08,763 --> 01:00:10,788
Oh, no. Great strength.

718
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:13,834
Ah. Did you inherit
that tendency?

719
01:00:13,935 --> 01:00:16,267
That is a very
direct question.

720
01:00:16,371 --> 01:00:18,805
Ah. Suppose it is.

721
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:21,569
But, you know,
I never talked to an uncle before.

722
01:00:21,676 --> 01:00:24,668
How do I talk
to an uncle?

723
01:00:24,779 --> 01:00:27,646
Very respectfully.
And you don't ask questions. You answer them.

724
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,876
Now, sit down,
and do just that.

725
01:00:31,986 --> 01:00:35,149
- Yes, sir.
- Not quite that respectful.

726
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:37,952
- Yes, UncleJervis.
- That's better.

727
01:00:38,059 --> 01:00:41,028
I take it that you haven't
any uncles of your own.

728
01:00:41,129 --> 01:00:43,597
No uncles, no aunts,
no cousins...

729
01:00:43,698 --> 01:00:45,996
no brothers,
no sisters, no nothing.

730
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:49,501
- Isn't there anyone who-
- Oh, it's a very sad story.

731
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:52,630
My father and mother were the duc
and duchesse de Monchartres...

732
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:55,174
and they both died
before I was born.

733
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:57,210
- Both.
- Yes.

734
01:00:57,312 --> 01:00:59,405
It was during a typhoon.

735
01:00:59,514 --> 01:01:02,745
Our yacht overturned
in the Sargasso Sea...

736
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:05,216
and I was
the only survivor.

737
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,288
Hmm.

738
01:01:09,324 --> 01:01:12,020
<i>- If you don't believe my story,
I have several others...</i>

739
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:15,186
<i>which are much more interesting.</i>

740
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,696
I'm sure you have.

741
01:01:21,369 --> 01:01:25,032
I only tell the stories
because nobody believes the truth.

742
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:29,632
Would you like to dance now?

743
01:01:29,744 --> 01:01:31,803
Uh, yes. l- I would.

744
01:01:39,887 --> 01:01:42,219
Uh...

745
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:44,689
would you tell me
what the truth is?

746
01:01:44,792 --> 01:01:46,851
Yes. I have a guardian.

747
01:01:46,961 --> 01:01:49,794
I see. Now, what
sort of man is he?

748
01:01:49,897 --> 01:01:52,525
Oh, he's tall
and very skinny.

749
01:01:52,633 --> 01:01:56,763
He always walks with a cane,
and he's bald up here.

750
01:01:56,871 --> 01:01:59,772
But he has a lovely fringe
of white hair all around.

751
01:01:59,874 --> 01:02:01,774
- All around?
- Uh-huh.

752
01:02:01,876 --> 01:02:03,810
Sounds perfectly stunning.

753
01:02:03,911 --> 01:02:07,278
Oh, don't you make fun of him.
I love him very much.

754
01:02:07,382 --> 01:02:10,180
- When I get out of college, I'm going to live with him.
- Huh?

755
01:02:10,284 --> 01:02:12,377
- You are?
- Yes.

756
01:02:12,487 --> 01:02:16,048
But it's a surprise. He doesn't know it yet.
I have it all planned.

757
01:02:16,157 --> 01:02:19,456
I'm going to read aloud to him
and plump his pillows...

758
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,858
and warm up his slippers...

759
01:02:21,963 --> 01:02:24,796
and always make sure he wears
his galoshes when he goes out.

760
01:02:24,899 --> 01:02:26,799
From the way you describe him...

761
01:02:26,901 --> 01:02:30,098
I don't think he'll be going out very often.

762
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:33,230
Oh, well. He's not a boy anymore.

763
01:02:33,341 --> 01:02:36,333
That is, uh,
probably true. Uh-

764
01:02:36,444 --> 01:02:38,412
Does he ever come
to see you?

765
01:02:40,915 --> 01:02:42,883
- No.
- Well, why not?

766
01:02:44,619 --> 01:02:47,383
Well, he doesn't care
anything about me really.

767
01:02:47,488 --> 01:02:50,252
Oh. Now, I'm sure he does.

768
01:02:50,358 --> 01:02:55,557
Oh, I just pretend. One must have
somebody to love, you know.

769
01:02:55,663 --> 01:02:57,995
So I make believe
that he really cares.

770
01:02:58,099 --> 01:03:02,229
- Maybe he does care, more than you think.
- Oh, he does, huh?

771
01:03:02,336 --> 01:03:06,397
I write to him all the time whenever
I get lonely. He doesn't even read my letters.

772
01:03:06,507 --> 01:03:09,237
- How do you know?
- He throws them in the wastebasket.

773
01:03:09,343 --> 01:03:12,676
He does no such thing.
I mean, I, uh, uh, don't think he does.

774
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:14,771
Then why
doesn't he ever answer?

775
01:03:17,018 --> 01:03:19,953
Dropsy.
Probably can't hold a pencil.

776
01:03:20,054 --> 01:03:23,455
<i>Oh la la.</i>

777
01:03:23,558 --> 01:03:26,049
<i>Hey, you.</i>

778
01:03:27,895 --> 01:03:30,887
Oh. It's only you, Professor.
I was gonna punch somebody in the nose.

779
01:03:30,998 --> 01:03:33,364
- Hey, Julie. We missed a dance.
- Oh. Sorry, Jimmy.

780
01:03:33,468 --> 01:03:35,493
This is Mr. Pendleton.
He's not a professor.

781
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,628
- Oh.
- Mr. Pendleton, Jimmy McBride.

782
01:03:37,738 --> 01:03:40,298
- How do you do?
- How do you do, sir? Natural mistake, of course.

783
01:03:40,408 --> 01:03:42,603
- Of course.
- Come on, Julie. They're gonna do "Sluefoot."

784
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:44,769
Oh, good.
Excuse us, UncleJervis.

785
01:03:44,879 --> 01:03:47,814
Thank you for keeping
Little Red Riding Hood away from the wolves.

786
01:04:03,111 --> 01:04:05,341
Now hear this

787
01:04:06,381 --> 01:04:08,315
Now hear this

788
01:04:10,385 --> 01:04:12,819
Everybody
everybody, everybody

789
01:04:12,921 --> 01:04:15,481
Get ready for sluefoot

790
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:17,558
Go!

791
01:04:22,631 --> 01:04:25,691
You want a dance
that's easy to do

792
01:04:25,801 --> 01:04:28,793
Then dig the one
I'm hippin' you to

793
01:04:28,904 --> 01:04:32,271
I'm gonna teach you
to fall in on what they are callin'

794
01:04:32,374 --> 01:04:35,207
The sluefoot

795
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:38,643
<i>You make your right foot
point to the north</i>

796
01:04:38,747 --> 01:04:41,682
<i>You make your left foot
point to the south</i>

797
01:04:41,783 --> 01:04:43,751
<i>And then you stroll
sort of westerly</i>

798
01:04:43,852 --> 01:04:46,719
<i>Slow and "siestally,"Sluefoot</i>

799
01:04:48,824 --> 01:04:54,490
<i>Don't be an oddball
and don't be a fig</i>

800
01:04:54,596 --> 01:04:57,793
<i>Try
Why be shy</i>

801
01:04:57,899 --> 01:05:00,925
<i>After all, it's even better
if your feet's too big</i>

802
01:05:01,036 --> 01:05:04,028
<i>You put the old
posterior out</i>

803
01:05:04,139 --> 01:05:07,302
<i>Then you manipulate it about</i>

804
01:05:07,409 --> 01:05:09,309
<i>It is the most
"lackadaisiest"</i>

805
01:05:09,411 --> 01:05:12,005
<i>I mean the craziest
Sluefoot</i>

806
01:05:13,448 --> 01:05:16,906
You gotta rock
like a rockin' chair

807
01:05:17,018 --> 01:05:20,181
The step is clocklike
but slightly square

808
01:05:20,288 --> 01:05:22,813
<i>You count to
one, two, three, four</i>

809
01:05:22,924 --> 01:05:25,415
<i>- Then you holler
- Sluefoot</i>

810
01:05:25,527 --> 01:05:29,793
<i>- You put your toe out
You drag it back</i>

811
01:05:29,898 --> 01:05:33,061
<i>- You really go out, You ball thejack
- Terribly sorry. l-</i>

812
01:05:33,168 --> 01:05:35,796
<i>Do what you done, done before
when you holler</i>

813
01:05:35,904 --> 01:05:37,804
Sluefoot

814
01:05:37,906 --> 01:05:39,806
<i>Well.</i>

815
01:05:39,908 --> 01:05:41,808
All right.

816
01:05:49,451 --> 01:05:51,976
Sluefoot

817
01:05:59,761 --> 01:06:02,093
- Go, Julie!
- Yeah!

818
01:06:02,197 --> 01:06:04,165
Don't stop now.

819
01:06:11,773 --> 01:06:13,741
Hey. That's it!

820
01:06:41,002 --> 01:06:44,130
- My, my, my!
- That's it. Keep goin'.

821
01:07:10,098 --> 01:07:12,430
Stay with it!

822
01:07:12,534 --> 01:07:14,502
Yeah, yeah!

823
01:08:50,962 --> 01:08:52,930
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

824
01:08:56,968 --> 01:08:58,936
Thanks.

825
01:09:38,309 --> 01:09:40,243
Hello, Jervis.

826
01:09:40,344 --> 01:09:43,142
Oh, hello, Griggs.
Wonderful day, isn't it?

827
01:09:44,315 --> 01:09:46,579
Yes. The market opened
very strong.

828
01:09:46,684 --> 01:09:49,676
- Bring the mail?
- Did I ever fail to bring it, Jervis?

829
01:09:53,191 --> 01:09:55,159
No.

830
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:08,705
My dear fellow, what are you in
such a foul mood about?

831
01:10:10,007 --> 01:10:12,441
The first days of spring
always affect me this way.

832
01:10:12,543 --> 01:10:17,037
Oh. Oh, Griggs. Uh, will you please
have this record sent to Miss Andre?

833
01:10:17,148 --> 01:10:20,345
- And who is sending the record?
- I am, of course.

834
01:10:20,451 --> 01:10:23,909
Yeah. I'm aware of that, Jervis,
but in which incarnation are you sending it?

835
01:10:24,021 --> 01:10:27,218
Jekyll or Hyde?
UncleJervis or Daddy Longlegs?

836
01:10:27,325 --> 01:10:30,624
Jervis Pendleton, and you can leave off
the "uncle," if you don't mind.

837
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:35,426
What you're looking for
is in the personal file.

838
01:10:35,533 --> 01:10:37,501
Thank you, Griggs.

839
01:10:41,739 --> 01:10:44,037
"Dear Daddy Longlegs, l-"

840
01:10:45,076 --> 01:10:47,408
"I'm- I met
Linda's UncleJervis.

841
01:10:47,511 --> 01:10:49,638
He seemed very nice."

842
01:10:49,747 --> 01:10:51,874
<i>"He seemed very nice."</i>

843
01:10:53,351 --> 01:10:55,319
<i>"He seemed very nice."</i>

844
01:10:58,756 --> 01:11:02,089
"But an awful thing has happened.
Oh, not to me, but toJimmy McBride.

845
01:11:02,193 --> 01:11:04,093
"He's had a dreadful
disappointment.

846
01:11:04,195 --> 01:11:08,029
He was all set to go to South Africa
as a mining engineer when the project blew up."

847
01:11:09,901 --> 01:11:12,335
"lmagine. Only about a month
from graduation...

848
01:11:12,436 --> 01:11:14,870
"and he considers himself
a failure.

849
01:11:14,972 --> 01:11:17,634
"If he would follow my advice,
he'd stay in this country...

850
01:11:17,742 --> 01:11:19,903
"and work in his father's
overalls factory.

851
01:11:20,011 --> 01:11:21,911
But he hates it."

852
01:11:22,013 --> 01:11:26,245
Hmm. "I can't tell you
how miserable I feel for him."

853
01:11:27,885 --> 01:11:29,876
- Griggs.
- Yes, Jervis.

854
01:11:29,987 --> 01:11:33,821
- Would you come here a moment, please?
- I'll be right there.

855
01:11:33,925 --> 01:11:39,022
"He was all set to go to South Africa as
a mining engineer when the project blew up."

856
01:11:40,564 --> 01:11:43,590
Uh, Griggs, I'd like to do something
for a young chap I know.

857
01:11:43,701 --> 01:11:46,397
Name's McBride.
Brilliant mining engineer.

858
01:11:46,504 --> 01:11:48,404
Do we have an opening for him?

859
01:11:48,506 --> 01:11:51,475
Well, our New Jersey lab
can always use a bright young man.

860
01:11:51,575 --> 01:11:54,635
No, no. Not- Not, uh- Not New Jersey.
He- He's the adventurous type.

861
01:11:54,745 --> 01:11:58,010
He- He'd want to go far away.
You know, see the world kind of thing.

862
01:11:58,115 --> 01:12:00,049
I see. Someplace
out of the country, eh?

863
01:12:00,151 --> 01:12:03,177
He'd sign up for a year's contract.
As a matter of fact, he wants to.

864
01:12:03,287 --> 01:12:05,187
He's a good man.
Very highly recommended.

865
01:12:05,289 --> 01:12:07,189
- By whom?
- By-

866
01:12:07,291 --> 01:12:11,523
By me. l- I, uh- I met him at
that college dance recently.

867
01:12:11,629 --> 01:12:14,257
He's a friend of Linda's.
I was quite impressed with him.

868
01:12:14,365 --> 01:12:18,358
I, uh- I have an eye for these young people
who are going places, you know.

869
01:12:18,469 --> 01:12:23,270
Going places.
How about our tin mines in Bolivia?

870
01:12:23,374 --> 01:12:26,172
- Bolivia?
- Would that be far enough away for you?

871
01:12:26,277 --> 01:12:29,269
- It's not for me. It's for him.
- Oh. Of course.

872
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:31,575
I can't imagine what
I was thinking of.

873
01:12:31,682 --> 01:12:34,344
- Our mines in Bolivia sound ideal.
- Oh, they are.

874
01:12:34,452 --> 01:12:39,048
Almost inaccessible. Takes two days to
reach them after you get off a burro's back.

875
01:12:39,156 --> 01:12:42,182
Fine, fine. Uh, will you get
Miss Pritchard in here, please?

876
01:12:42,293 --> 01:12:45,421
- Miss Pritchard?
- Yes. I want her to take a letter now.

877
01:12:45,529 --> 01:12:48,327
I thought perhaps you wanted
to teach her the sluefoot.

878
01:13:31,342 --> 01:13:33,242
Hi, Jervis.

879
01:13:33,344 --> 01:13:35,244
Oh. Hello, Larry.
How are you?

880
01:13:35,346 --> 01:13:37,280
- Fine, fine.
- Good, good.

881
01:13:37,381 --> 01:13:39,713
- Meeting someone?
- Yeah. My niece Linda and her roommate.

882
01:13:39,817 --> 01:13:41,717
They're coming down
from college.

883
01:13:41,819 --> 01:13:44,720
- Oh, yes? I wish I knew she was on the plane.
- Yeah. Oh.

884
01:13:44,822 --> 01:13:48,155
- Jervis, how are you?
- Hello, Julie. So good to see you. How was the flight?

885
01:13:48,259 --> 01:13:50,819
- Just wonderful. Wonderful.
- Well, Jervis, I'll just-

886
01:13:50,928 --> 01:13:53,624
Pardon me. Uh, M-Mr. Hamilton,
Miss Andre. Uh, uh-

887
01:13:53,731 --> 01:13:55,631
- How do you do?
- Where-Where's Linda?

888
01:13:55,733 --> 01:13:57,633
- She couldn't come.
- She couldn't come?

889
01:13:57,735 --> 01:14:00,499
- No.
- Well, as I was saying, Jervis, I'll just be buzzing along.

890
01:14:00,604 --> 01:14:02,902
Uh, three's
a... you know what.

891
01:14:03,007 --> 01:14:04,907
- Very happy to have met you.
- Good-bye.

892
01:14:05,009 --> 01:14:07,341
Uh, uh-
What happened to Linda?

893
01:14:07,445 --> 01:14:09,606
Oh, she woke up this morning
with the sniffles...

894
01:14:09,713 --> 01:14:13,114
and she told me her colds always
get much worse before they get better...

895
01:14:13,217 --> 01:14:15,344
so I just let her-

896
01:14:15,453 --> 01:14:18,115
- Shouldn't I have come alone?
- Oh, yes. Of course. Certainly.

897
01:14:18,222 --> 01:14:20,122
I'd have been very disappointed
if you hadn't.

898
01:14:20,224 --> 01:14:22,158
- Oh.
- Really. Are these your baggage checks?

899
01:14:22,259 --> 01:14:24,523
- Yes.
- John, will you handle these for Miss Andre, please?

900
01:14:24,628 --> 01:14:26,528
Yeah. Sure.

901
01:14:54,592 --> 01:14:56,526
This way, please,
Mr. Pendleton.

902
01:15:23,287 --> 01:15:26,085
Oh. Jervis,
you know, it's-

903
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:28,624
It's just beautiful.

904
01:15:28,726 --> 01:15:30,956
Count four towers over
and nine towers to the right.

905
01:15:31,061 --> 01:15:33,723
In the basement of the 10th tower
there's a lovely little restaurant.

906
01:15:33,831 --> 01:15:36,527
I thought we might
have dinner.

907
01:15:36,634 --> 01:15:40,934
Why don't we have it right here
so we can see the lights of the city?

908
01:15:41,038 --> 01:15:43,131
Don't they teach you
anything at that college?

909
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:46,232
You know what
they'll be thinking.

910
01:15:46,343 --> 01:15:48,903
Oh, it's ridiculous.
What time would you like to dine?

911
01:15:49,013 --> 01:15:50,913
Oh, anytime.

912
01:15:51,015 --> 01:15:52,915
- Be back at 7:00.
- Mm-hmm.

913
01:15:53,017 --> 01:15:55,781
- Black tie?
- But of course.

914
01:16:21,278 --> 01:16:25,305
You know, Jervis. I've worked out
your whole past.

915
01:16:25,416 --> 01:16:27,543
That doesn't surprise me
in the least.

916
01:16:27,651 --> 01:16:29,881
There was someone years ago.

917
01:16:29,987 --> 01:16:32,512
She was tall, slender...

918
01:16:32,623 --> 01:16:36,218
blonde, very beautiful,
and you loved her madly.

919
01:16:36,327 --> 01:16:38,261
But she married
someone else.

920
01:16:38,362 --> 01:16:41,661
- Oh, she was very foolish.
- Thank you.

921
01:16:41,765 --> 01:16:44,893
So you never loved
anyone else since.

922
01:16:45,002 --> 01:16:46,902
Is that the way it was?

923
01:16:48,105 --> 01:16:51,632
No. There never was
a tall, slender blonde...

924
01:16:51,742 --> 01:16:53,710
but there was a short
little redhead.

925
01:16:53,811 --> 01:16:56,245
And then there was
a very large brunette.

926
01:16:56,347 --> 01:16:58,815
And then there was someone
I met in Switzerland.

927
01:16:58,916 --> 01:17:01,043
<i>- And then there was-
- Hmm. Oh la la.</i>

928
01:17:01,151 --> 01:17:03,585
- And you loved them all?
- Madly.

929
01:17:03,687 --> 01:17:06,155
Hmm. And why didn't you
ever marry?

930
01:17:06,257 --> 01:17:08,487
I didn't love them
that madly.

931
01:17:10,561 --> 01:17:12,620
I don't think
you ever will.

932
01:17:14,598 --> 01:17:16,657
Marry?

933
01:17:16,767 --> 01:17:18,735
Hmm.

934
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:22,038
That all depends.

935
01:17:23,107 --> 01:17:26,565
You know,
there's an old theory.

936
01:17:26,677 --> 01:17:28,645
I mean-

937
01:17:30,114 --> 01:17:35,814
When an irresistible force

938
01:17:35,919 --> 01:17:38,410
Such as you

939
01:17:38,522 --> 01:17:44,392
Meets an old
immovable object

940
01:17:44,495 --> 01:17:46,759
Like me

941
01:17:46,864 --> 01:17:52,769
You can bet
as sure as you live

942
01:17:54,805 --> 01:18:00,710
Something's gotta give, Something's gotta give
Something's gotta give

943
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:08,809
When an irrepressible smile

944
01:18:08,919 --> 01:18:11,444
Such as yours

945
01:18:11,555 --> 01:18:16,857
Warms an old
implacable heart

946
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,428
Such as mine

947
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:25,435
Don't say no
because I insist

948
01:18:27,371 --> 01:18:33,276
Somewhere, somehow
someone's gonna be kissed

949
01:18:34,745 --> 01:18:38,112
So, en garde

950
01:18:38,215 --> 01:18:43,585
Who knows what the Fates
have in store

951
01:18:43,687 --> 01:18:49,592
From their vast
mysterious sky

952
01:18:50,728 --> 01:18:54,129
I'll try hard

953
01:18:54,231 --> 01:18:59,931
Ignoring those lips
I adore

954
01:19:00,037 --> 01:19:05,942
But how long
can anyone try

955
01:19:07,878 --> 01:19:11,143
Fight, fight, fight, fight

956
01:19:11,248 --> 01:19:14,684
Fight it with
all of our might

957
01:19:16,153 --> 01:19:18,053
<i>Chances are</i>

958
01:19:18,155 --> 01:19:23,218
Some heavenly
star-spangled night

959
01:19:24,862 --> 01:19:30,767
<i>We'll find out
as sure as we live</i>

960
01:19:32,669 --> 01:19:37,936
Something's gotta give, Something's gotta give
Something's gotta give

961
01:23:07,084 --> 01:23:12,989
When an irresistible
force

962
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:16,423
Such as you

963
01:23:16,526 --> 01:23:22,431
Meets an old
immovable object

964
01:23:22,532 --> 01:23:25,000
Like you

965
01:23:48,792 --> 01:23:50,783
Your morning paper.

966
01:23:50,894 --> 01:23:53,488
Oh.

967
01:23:53,597 --> 01:23:56,464
Uh, did anything
happen yesterday?

968
01:24:01,538 --> 01:24:05,030
- A man got robbed.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. What a shame.

969
01:24:05,142 --> 01:24:07,042
A girl got married.

970
01:24:07,144 --> 01:24:09,635
Ah. That's nice.

971
01:24:09,746 --> 01:24:11,714
Who did she marry?

972
01:24:11,815 --> 01:24:15,046
- A man.
- Oh.

973
01:24:15,152 --> 01:24:17,211
They've been in love
for a long time.

974
01:24:18,488 --> 01:24:20,456
Oh.

975
01:24:22,492 --> 01:24:24,483
Anything else happen?

976
01:24:27,197 --> 01:24:30,257
Yes. But it's not
in the paper.

977
01:24:31,902 --> 01:24:34,769
- Oh.
- Good night, Julie.

978
01:24:35,806 --> 01:24:37,740
Good night, Jervis.

979
01:25:30,327 --> 01:25:32,295
Excuse me,
Mr. Ambassador.

980
01:25:39,035 --> 01:25:41,299
- Right this way, Mr. Ambassador.
- Thank you.

981
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:50,109
I think you'll find this to your liking.
This wing is very quiet.

982
01:25:56,753 --> 01:25:58,983
- How much is it?
- It's worth $200,000.

983
01:25:59,089 --> 01:26:00,989
- Did you say something, Griggs?
- l-

984
01:26:01,091 --> 01:26:03,889
- I was merely inquiring about the price, Jervis.
- Hmm.

985
01:26:03,994 --> 01:26:07,122
Uh, have you something simpler?
Much larger, but simpler.

986
01:26:07,230 --> 01:26:09,494
Yes, Mr. Pendleton.
I think we have the very thing.

987
01:26:09,599 --> 01:26:11,499
Hmm.

988
01:26:11,601 --> 01:26:13,796
<i>Well.</i>

989
01:26:13,904 --> 01:26:16,634
$300,000.

990
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:19,903
I, uh- I think that's
kind of cute, don't you?

991
01:26:22,179 --> 01:26:24,079
Very cute.

992
01:26:24,181 --> 01:26:26,672
Oh. Very cute.

993
01:26:26,783 --> 01:26:28,808
Well, that's it.
I'm glad you all agree.

994
01:26:28,919 --> 01:26:32,650
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a breakfast
appointment. Good-bye.

995
01:26:32,756 --> 01:26:36,248
Uh, uh, you understand, of course,
this is subject to the lady's approval.

996
01:26:36,359 --> 01:26:39,328
Naturally. But I think
you should know, Mr. Griggs...

997
01:26:39,429 --> 01:26:42,762
it's been our experience
that a diamond of that quality...

998
01:26:42,866 --> 01:26:44,766
never comes back.

999
01:26:44,868 --> 01:26:46,836
Never.

1000
01:27:14,831 --> 01:27:17,095
<i>Thank you.</i>

1001
01:27:21,471 --> 01:27:24,133
- Coffee now, Jervis?
- Yes, please.

1002
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:34,443
You know, last night was the most
wonderful night of my life.

1003
01:27:36,453 --> 01:27:39,217
<i>- I'll drink to that.
- Yes.</i>

1004
01:27:42,325 --> 01:27:45,419
And let's drink to today.
Look how beautiful it is.

1005
01:27:45,528 --> 01:27:48,725
I'm glad you like it. I ordered it especially for you.

1006
01:27:48,832 --> 01:27:53,326
<i>I suppose if you're
a Pendleton you can make anything happen.</i>

1007
01:27:53,436 --> 01:27:56,030
<i>- Can't you, Jervis?
- Mmm. Not quite.</i>

1008
01:27:56,139 --> 01:27:58,300
<i>Some things are
in the lap of the gods.</i>

1009
01:28:00,944 --> 01:28:03,936
You know, Jervis, yesterday
when I arrived from college...

1010
01:28:04,047 --> 01:28:07,881
and you looked so stern, and you thought
that I should not have come alone-

1011
01:28:09,452 --> 01:28:11,477
<i>Well, I have
a confession to make.</i>

1012
01:28:11,588 --> 01:28:15,718
<i>I was really terribly afraid and unsure.</i>

1013
01:28:15,825 --> 01:28:18,623
<i>But it's been very wonderful.</i>

1014
01:28:18,728 --> 01:28:23,097
<i>You know, last time I came in that airport
was when I arrived from France.</i>

1015
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:27,192
<i>Was that only three years ago?
Seems like forever.</i>

1016
01:28:29,205 --> 01:28:32,299
Let's drink to France
for having sent you here.

1017
01:28:32,409 --> 01:28:34,502
To America
for letting me come.

1018
01:29:09,045 --> 01:29:11,240
Connect me
with 3203, please.

1019
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:19,720
- Hello?
- I'd like to speak with Mr. Pendleton, please.

1020
01:29:19,823 --> 01:29:22,849
Oh. Just a minute.
Jervis, it's for you.

1021
01:29:28,765 --> 01:29:32,929
- Hello.
- Jervis, you are the most contemptible...

1022
01:29:33,036 --> 01:29:36,870
deceitful, dishonorable character
it has ever been my misfortune to know.

1023
01:29:36,973 --> 01:29:40,739
Who is this? Who?

1024
01:29:40,844 --> 01:29:44,336
Oh, uh- Oh. Well, yeah.
I think so, Alec.

1025
01:29:44,447 --> 01:29:48,144
Well, all right. I will.
Right away. Yeah.

1026
01:29:54,958 --> 01:29:58,519
Um, Julie, I'll be right back.
Uh, just a few minutes.

1027
01:29:58,628 --> 01:30:01,654
- Where are you going?
- Some friend of mine wants to see me.

1028
01:30:01,765 --> 01:30:04,233
You finish breakfast.
It won't be long. Just-

1029
01:30:20,483 --> 01:30:22,451
Hi.

1030
01:30:27,824 --> 01:30:29,985
Well, I'm waiting.
Say something.

1031
01:30:30,093 --> 01:30:32,653
All right.
Why aren't you in France?

1032
01:30:32,762 --> 01:30:34,992
I am here to report
to the secretary of state.

1033
01:30:35,098 --> 01:30:37,965
- Then why aren't you in Washington?
- I'll be there tonight.

1034
01:30:38,068 --> 01:30:40,468
Now that I've answered your questions,
suppose you answer mine.

1035
01:30:40,570 --> 01:30:44,563
- What are you doing in that next suite?
- Why, you evil-minded-

1036
01:30:44,674 --> 01:30:47,040
Jervis, the last time you accused me
of being evil-minded...

1037
01:30:47,143 --> 01:30:50,544
was when you wanted to bring that young
French girl to this country to "educate."

1038
01:30:50,647 --> 01:30:53,081
- Alec- - Never mind what the
newspapers would make of all this.

1039
01:30:53,183 --> 01:30:56,311
How you enlisted the services of the
United States government in your enterprise.

1040
01:30:56,419 --> 01:30:59,684
Never mind the part I played.
Let's leave all that out. Think of the girl.

1041
01:30:59,789 --> 01:31:01,689
She is here
on a student's visa.

1042
01:31:01,791 --> 01:31:03,691
Her behavior is subject
to constant scrutiny.

1043
01:31:03,793 --> 01:31:05,727
She could be expelled,
her passport picked up-

1044
01:31:05,829 --> 01:31:09,162
Now, wait a minute. Now, wait a minute.
Alec, it is nothing like that.

1045
01:31:09,265 --> 01:31:11,790
Jervis, I was on the terrace.
Now, I'm no eavesdropper...

1046
01:31:11,901 --> 01:31:14,392
but I'd have to be deaf
not to overhear the conversation...

1047
01:31:14,504 --> 01:31:17,905
- you and the young lady were having at the breakfast table.
- Like what?

1048
01:31:18,007 --> 01:31:22,376
"Jervis, last night was
the most wonderful night of my life."

1049
01:31:22,479 --> 01:31:25,471
Even the most generous
interpretation of that is horrifying.

1050
01:31:25,582 --> 01:31:28,278
And serving her cocktails
at this hour.

1051
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:32,411
- Cocktails? Are you nuts?
- I distinctly heard the glasses clink.

1052
01:31:32,522 --> 01:31:34,513
It was orange juice.

1053
01:31:34,624 --> 01:31:37,923
Nobody clinks orange juice glasses.
I haven't been out of the country that long.

1054
01:31:38,027 --> 01:31:41,827
- Alec, you've got it all wrong. I'm in love with the girl.
- Is she in love with you?

1055
01:31:41,931 --> 01:31:45,594
I don't know. I was just about to ask her
when the darn phone rang, and it was you.

1056
01:31:45,702 --> 01:31:48,728
I'm glad I was in time. What could
the poor girl have said but "yes"?

1057
01:31:48,838 --> 01:31:50,806
- She could have said "no."
- Don't be ridiculous.

1058
01:31:50,907 --> 01:31:52,807
You've obviously
swept her off her feet.

1059
01:31:52,909 --> 01:31:55,104
You're older than she is.
That's always very attractive.

1060
01:31:55,211 --> 01:31:57,304
- You're rich, and that's even more attractive.
- Mm-hmm.

1061
01:31:57,413 --> 01:32:01,144
You've changed her life completely,
for which she must be very grateful.

1062
01:32:01,251 --> 01:32:04,584
She doesn't know anything about that.
She doesn't know that I'm her Daddy-

1063
01:32:06,923 --> 01:32:09,653
Daddy what?
Daddy Sugar?

1064
01:32:10,894 --> 01:32:12,794
Oh, shut up.

1065
01:32:12,896 --> 01:32:15,729
She only knows me as Jervis Pendleton,
the uncle of her roommate.

1066
01:32:15,832 --> 01:32:19,666
The uncle of her roommate.
Doesn't that at least give you pause?

1067
01:32:19,769 --> 01:32:23,364
Not particularly. I'm not the only man
she's met in America.

1068
01:32:23,473 --> 01:32:25,600
Uh, she's also interested
in a Harvard graduate.

1069
01:32:25,708 --> 01:32:28,700
Can he afford to bring her to New York
and entertain her in this style?

1070
01:32:28,811 --> 01:32:31,609
- Well-
- Of course not. He's probably out looking for a job.

1071
01:32:31,714 --> 01:32:36,344
He is not. He's working in Bolivia
in the tin mine. Now, if you'll excuse me-

1072
01:32:36,452 --> 01:32:40,388
It wouldn't by any chance happen
to be the Pendleton tin mine, would it?

1073
01:32:42,358 --> 01:32:45,293
Well, uh, he- he-
he needed a job, uh-

1074
01:32:45,395 --> 01:32:48,125
And, well, what's the matter
with helping young people? Uh-

1075
01:32:48,231 --> 01:32:51,894
It's an interesting hobby.
You seem to have embraced it vigorously.

1076
01:32:52,001 --> 01:32:55,164
Well, he applied for a job in Africa.
The project blew up, and-

1077
01:32:55,271 --> 01:32:58,001
and I just happened to have
an opening in Bolivia.

1078
01:32:59,042 --> 01:33:01,010
King David.

1079
01:33:02,045 --> 01:33:03,945
What are you
talking about?

1080
01:33:04,047 --> 01:33:08,711
David sent Uriah into battle
because he coveted Bathsheba.

1081
01:33:08,818 --> 01:33:11,582
Oh, no. Oh, no.

1082
01:33:11,688 --> 01:33:14,486
Oh, I've had just about enough.
Now, look here, Alec.

1083
01:33:14,591 --> 01:33:17,389
There's nothing underhanded
or deceitful about this.

1084
01:33:17,493 --> 01:33:19,393
l-lt is true
I sent that young man-

1085
01:33:19,495 --> 01:33:21,486
Well, he was going
out of the country anyway.

1086
01:33:21,598 --> 01:33:23,759
He needed a job,
and- and I sent him.

1087
01:33:23,866 --> 01:33:26,733
Oh, sure. Sure the girl
is much younger than I am.

1088
01:33:26,836 --> 01:33:28,736
l- I'm not denying that.

1089
01:33:28,838 --> 01:33:31,363
Sure I'm rich.
There's no question about that.

1090
01:33:31,474 --> 01:33:34,204
Certainly I did everything possible
to sweep her off her feet.

1091
01:33:34,310 --> 01:33:36,437
But doesn't every man
who's in lo-

1092
01:33:42,652 --> 01:33:45,018
Ah, you're absolutely right.

1093
01:33:45,121 --> 01:33:47,316
It's insane.

1094
01:33:47,423 --> 01:33:49,857
What was I thinking of?

1095
01:33:49,959 --> 01:33:51,927
I don't know.

1096
01:33:53,062 --> 01:33:55,292
- You got a cigarette here?
- Hmm.

1097
01:33:59,702 --> 01:34:01,602
She must be
very attractive, Jervis.

1098
01:34:01,704 --> 01:34:03,604
Very.

1099
01:34:03,706 --> 01:34:05,606
I'll, uh-

1100
01:34:05,708 --> 01:34:08,233
I'll- I'll bring that boy
back from Bolivia.

1101
01:34:14,584 --> 01:34:18,520
Alec, have you any idea how many hotels
there are in New York?

1102
01:34:18,621 --> 01:34:23,684
- Not the slightest.
- There are hundreds, thousands.

1103
01:34:23,793 --> 01:34:26,853
But, Jervis,
I always stop here.

1104
01:35:12,575 --> 01:35:14,543
3203, please.

1105
01:35:21,851 --> 01:35:23,842
Jervis, where are you?
What are you doing?

1106
01:35:23,953 --> 01:35:27,889
Uh, I'm downstairs
in the lobby.

1107
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:31,221
Uh, listen. Something terribly important
has just come up...

1108
01:35:31,327 --> 01:35:34,524
and I'm afraid I won't be able to
get back there to see you.

1109
01:35:34,630 --> 01:35:36,564
No, no. No.
I'm- I'm all right.

1110
01:35:36,666 --> 01:35:40,898
It's just-just business.
You know, uh, State Department.

1111
01:35:41,003 --> 01:35:44,734
Um-Well, it's rather
hard to explain.

1112
01:35:44,841 --> 01:35:49,505
Uh, there are certain things about it
that I'm not at liberty to discuss.

1113
01:35:49,612 --> 01:35:53,742
- Can you understand that?
- Of course I understand. When shall I see you?

1114
01:35:53,850 --> 01:35:55,818
Well, uh-

1115
01:35:57,387 --> 01:35:59,355
They may-They may
want me to go abroad.

1116
01:35:59,455 --> 01:36:02,720
In which case, uh,
l- I won't see you for quite some time.

1117
01:36:06,562 --> 01:36:08,530
Oh.

1118
01:36:10,133 --> 01:36:12,101
Oh.

1119
01:36:13,803 --> 01:36:17,034
Oh, l- I see.
I see. Oh.

1120
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:19,108
Well-

1121
01:36:20,777 --> 01:36:23,974
Oh, no. I'm-
I'm not upset. I'm...

1122
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:25,980
just disappointed.

1123
01:36:26,082 --> 01:36:28,676
Uh, Julie, um,
I want you to see New York.

1124
01:36:28,785 --> 01:36:31,879
And, uh, I'll send the car and the chauffeur
or anything you want.

1125
01:36:31,988 --> 01:36:34,582
Thank you very much.

1126
01:36:38,528 --> 01:36:40,496
Did you say something?

1127
01:36:43,132 --> 01:36:45,327
Well...

1128
01:36:45,435 --> 01:36:47,335
bon voyage.

1129
01:36:49,539 --> 01:36:51,439
Thank you.

1130
01:36:51,541 --> 01:36:54,237
Take care of yourself, Julie.

1131
01:36:54,343 --> 01:36:56,311
Good-bye.

1132
01:37:33,583 --> 01:37:36,108
- Hey, Linda. Catch.
- Hey. You sure this is mine?

1133
01:37:36,219 --> 01:37:38,119
Positive.

1134
01:37:38,221 --> 01:37:40,121
How am I ever gonna fit this in?

1135
01:37:40,223 --> 01:37:43,522
Oh. How do you suppose we ever
accumulated so much junk in only four years?

1136
01:37:43,626 --> 01:37:45,526
- Say, Linda. Is this yours?
- No.

1137
01:37:45,628 --> 01:37:49,086
Well, I don't know who it could belong to.
Anyone belong to this? Hi.

1138
01:37:49,198 --> 01:37:51,098
- Hi.
- Hi, Julie.

1139
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,896
- Last call. Anyone belong to this?
- Oh. Sally. Sally, it's mine.

1140
01:37:54,003 --> 01:37:56,198
Oh. I never
saw you wear it.

1141
01:37:56,305 --> 01:37:59,206
- Yeah. I know, but it's mine.
- Oh.

1142
01:37:59,308 --> 01:38:01,640
Hey, Julie.
Aren't you gonna pack?

1143
01:38:01,744 --> 01:38:04,804
Oh. We have
plenty of time.

1144
01:38:05,882 --> 01:38:08,077
There's a whole week
till graduation.

1145
01:38:08,184 --> 01:38:11,176
Well, don't you want your things
to get there before you do?

1146
01:38:12,855 --> 01:38:15,016
Yeah.
I guess so.

1147
01:38:18,094 --> 01:38:20,494
<i>Do you know something?</i>

1148
01:38:20,596 --> 01:38:23,258
I don't even think
she knows where to send her trunks.

1149
01:38:23,366 --> 01:38:27,496
- No, it's not that. It's that darn UncleJervis of mine.
- Yeah.

1150
01:38:27,603 --> 01:38:31,198
Now you see him, now you don't. There they
were having a perfectly wonderful time...

1151
01:38:31,307 --> 01:38:34,003
and suddenly he calls her up
and says he has to go away.

1152
01:38:34,110 --> 01:38:37,477
He's been traveling ever since.
Last time I heard, he was in Madrid.

1153
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:40,105
- I thought he was in Calcutta.
- That was three cities ago.

1154
01:38:40,216 --> 01:38:43,049
- Last week he was in Hong Kong.
- Oh, the beast.

1155
01:38:43,152 --> 01:38:46,610
Still, he can be awfully nice when he wants to.
Look how nice he's been toJimmy.

1156
01:38:46,722 --> 01:38:48,622
- Yeah.
- Brought him back to New York.

1157
01:38:48,724 --> 01:38:50,624
- Raised his salary. Raised it twice.
- Hmm.

1158
01:38:50,726 --> 01:38:53,251
And you can hardly say
Jimmy's been a success.

1159
01:38:53,362 --> 01:38:56,991
You know, that new experiment
of his nearly blew up the whole lab last week.

1160
01:38:57,099 --> 01:39:01,559
I know. My UncleJervis
is very strange.

1161
01:39:01,671 --> 01:39:03,866
<i>Very.</i>

1162
01:39:28,497 --> 01:39:31,796
Rio. Jervis Pendleton in Rio.

1163
01:39:34,770 --> 01:39:38,672
Personality of the week in India.

1164
01:39:41,477 --> 01:39:44,571
Lisbon.

1165
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:47,148
Spain. Oh-

1166
01:39:53,155 --> 01:39:55,453
The Opera of Paris.

1167
01:39:58,394 --> 01:40:00,362
<i>Oh, zut.</i>

1168
01:40:17,213 --> 01:40:19,477
Dear Daddy Longlegs-

1169
01:40:23,219 --> 01:40:26,154
May I please come to see you?

1170
01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:34,152
I am desperately...

1171
01:40:34,263 --> 01:40:36,231
in need of advice.

1172
01:40:41,070 --> 01:40:43,698
And there is no one...

1173
01:40:43,806 --> 01:40:47,401
I can turn to but you.

1174
01:41:35,891 --> 01:41:39,520
<i>Something's gotta give, Something's gotta give</i>

1175
01:41:39,628 --> 01:41:44,691
<i>Something's gotta give, Something's gotta give
Something's gotta give</i>

1176
01:47:06,889 --> 01:47:10,347
<i>Something's gotta give, Something's gotta give</i>

1177
01:47:10,459 --> 01:47:13,019
<i>Something's gotta give</i>

1178
01:53:20,695 --> 01:53:22,856
<i>Julie. Julie.</i>

1179
01:53:24,132 --> 01:53:26,225
<i>Huh? Oui?</i>

1180
01:53:28,403 --> 01:53:31,497
- Oh, Linda.
- I was just going down to the post office.

1181
01:53:31,606 --> 01:53:33,733
Want me to mail that
for you?

1182
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:38,002
Oh. Oh, yes. Please.

1183
01:53:38,113 --> 01:53:41,139
- Can you wait a minute?
- Sure. Take your time.

1184
01:53:58,900 --> 01:54:00,800
- Mr. Griggs.
- Yes.

1185
01:54:00,902 --> 01:54:02,802
- You are critically ill.
- I am?

1186
01:54:02,904 --> 01:54:05,065
- The doctors have no hope for you.
- They haven't?

1187
01:54:05,173 --> 01:54:07,539
We must cable Mr. Pendleton
to come home immediately.

1188
01:54:07,642 --> 01:54:10,042
- There's been another letter from that girl.
- Yes, Mr. Griggs...

1189
01:54:10,145 --> 01:54:12,045
and what are we
going to do about her?

1190
01:54:12,147 --> 01:54:15,173
You can't just hand somebody the world
and then take it away from them.

1191
01:54:15,283 --> 01:54:18,116
Well, I'm in the process
of drafting a letter to her now.

1192
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:21,417
- I've been told that she's to be married shortly.
- Oh, a lot you know.

1193
01:54:21,523 --> 01:54:24,981
Well, in the event that she doesn't,
a trust fund is being established.

1194
01:54:25,093 --> 01:54:27,527
And from that she'll be given
a sensible income each month.

1195
01:54:27,629 --> 01:54:30,462
- She'll have security for the rest of her life.
- Security?

1196
01:54:30,565 --> 01:54:33,625
I have security,
and believe me, it's nothing.

1197
01:54:33,735 --> 01:54:36,568
You have security,
and a duller life nobody ever led.

1198
01:54:36,671 --> 01:54:39,572
Well, I'm glad to know what you think
about security, Miss Pritchard...

1199
01:54:39,674 --> 01:54:41,642
because you may be
about to lose yours!

1200
01:54:41,743 --> 01:54:45,702
I can't, Mr. Griggs, because I qualified
for my pension last month.

1201
01:54:45,814 --> 01:54:49,875
Maybe that's why I don't care. But if you won't
cooperate with me, I'll send the cable myself.

1202
01:54:49,985 --> 01:54:51,885
Y-

1203
01:54:51,987 --> 01:54:55,423
- Well, if you qualified for your pension, how about a drink?
- Bourbon on the rocks.

1204
01:54:55,524 --> 01:54:57,492
Uh-

1205
01:55:01,496 --> 01:55:03,760
What do you plan
to say in that cable?

1206
01:55:03,865 --> 01:55:07,392
"Griggs critically ill.
Imperative you come home immediately.

1207
01:55:07,502 --> 01:55:09,595
Doctors have no hope."

1208
01:55:09,704 --> 01:55:13,196
Oh, that's fine.
Thank you.

1209
01:55:13,308 --> 01:55:16,744
If I'd offered you a drink 25 years ago,
you'd have slapped my face.

1210
01:55:16,845 --> 01:55:19,006
How do you know?

1211
01:55:19,114 --> 01:55:21,082
You never asked me.

1212
01:55:27,822 --> 01:55:29,790
Helen Adams.

1213
01:55:34,529 --> 01:55:36,429
Julie Andre.

1214
01:55:41,002 --> 01:55:42,970
<i>Sue Anthony.</i>

1215
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:47,508
<i>Mary Armstrong.</i>

1216
01:55:49,377 --> 01:55:51,345
<i>Patricia Benton.</i>

1217
01:55:53,415 --> 01:55:55,383
<i>Margaret Benson.</i>

1218
01:56:38,727 --> 01:56:40,820
<i>Come in.</i>

1219
01:56:40,929 --> 01:56:44,421
Congratulations, my dear.
Congratulations.

1220
01:56:44,532 --> 01:56:47,467
- Well, thank you.
- I had a lovely cry too.

1221
01:56:47,569 --> 01:56:50,436
This is the first graduation
I've been to since my own.

1222
01:56:50,538 --> 01:56:54,599
Well, I don't want to appear impolite,
but should I know you?

1223
01:56:54,709 --> 01:56:57,803
There's no reason why you should.
I'm Alicia Pritchard.

1224
01:56:57,912 --> 01:57:01,871
- And I've come to take you to seeJohn Smith.
- Oh. John-John Smith?

1225
01:57:01,983 --> 01:57:04,781
Daddy Longlegs.

1226
01:57:04,886 --> 01:57:06,854
Oh.

1227
01:57:06,955 --> 01:57:08,855
He wants to see me.

1228
01:57:08,957 --> 01:57:11,721
Well, let's say
he's going to see you.

1229
01:57:11,826 --> 01:57:14,192
Oh.

1230
01:57:14,295 --> 01:57:16,786
- Who is he?
- I think he should tell you that himself.

1231
01:57:16,898 --> 01:57:20,129
Now you hurry and change
because we're going to New York.

1232
01:57:20,235 --> 01:57:22,203
Oh.

1233
01:57:22,303 --> 01:57:24,396
<i>- We go to New York today?
- Today.</i>

1234
01:57:24,506 --> 01:57:28,499
- Today? She's bringing her here today?
- Very shortly.

1235
01:57:28,610 --> 01:57:32,979
That cablegram was right.
Brother, you are sick. Sick in the head.

1236
01:57:33,081 --> 01:57:37,211
Don't you know about that girl and Jimmy
McBride? Why, they're suited to each other.

1237
01:57:37,318 --> 01:57:39,309
They'll be married,
happy and have children.

1238
01:57:39,421 --> 01:57:42,549
Why, ifJulie comes here today and-
and finds out that I did everything...

1239
01:57:42,657 --> 01:57:44,557
she'd- she'd be beholden.

1240
01:57:44,659 --> 01:57:47,822
She'd fling herself into my arms
out of gratitude. Now, who wants that?

1241
01:57:47,929 --> 01:57:50,625
Don't you know that's just
the reason I went away?

1242
01:57:50,732 --> 01:57:52,859
Jervis, if I were you,
I'd pull myself together.

1243
01:57:52,967 --> 01:57:55,333
Miss Andre will be coming through
that door very shortly.

1244
01:57:55,437 --> 01:57:59,464
Oh. Well, when she does, do you know who
she's gonna find sitting behind that desk? You.

1245
01:57:59,574 --> 01:58:02,099
- Me?
- Yes. You started all this, and you can handle it.

1246
01:58:02,210 --> 01:58:04,770
- You are Daddy Longlegs. Sit down.
- But-

1247
01:58:04,879 --> 01:58:07,541
She's never seen you before.
You fit her description of me...

1248
01:58:07,649 --> 01:58:09,617
better than I do myself,
you old fuddy-duddy.

1249
01:58:09,718 --> 01:58:12,243
<i>But this is ridiculous.
What would I say to her?</i>

1250
01:58:12,353 --> 01:58:16,084
I don't give a hang what you say to her.
You can propose marriage for all I care.

1251
01:58:16,191 --> 01:58:19,285
Let's keep this thing tucked around you
so you'll look properly feeble.

1252
01:58:19,394 --> 01:58:23,125
Keep your head down. You know, you haven't
the strength to keep your chin up anymore.

1253
01:58:23,231 --> 01:58:25,131
- You've been very ill. Remember?
- Oh!

1254
01:58:25,233 --> 01:58:27,133
Okay. That's good.

1255
01:58:27,235 --> 01:58:29,726
Ah. Whistler's father.

1256
01:58:29,838 --> 01:58:33,171
You may accept my resignation from your
employment- effective as of this moment.

1257
01:58:33,274 --> 01:58:35,742
<i>It's too late now. Don't you dare move. Yeah?</i>

1258
01:58:35,844 --> 01:58:37,744
- Mr. Pendleton-
- Fine. Have her come right up.

1259
01:58:37,846 --> 01:58:39,780
- Yes, sir.
- Now, Jervis, don't be a fool.

1260
01:58:39,881 --> 01:58:41,781
Look. I'm an expert
at being a fool.

1261
01:58:41,883 --> 01:58:43,908
That's why I know
I'm not being one this time.

1262
01:58:44,018 --> 01:58:45,986
Y-Y-

1263
01:58:54,562 --> 01:58:56,462
Uh, come in, my dear.

1264
01:58:56,564 --> 01:58:59,158
<i>Sit down, my dear.</i>

1265
01:58:59,267 --> 01:59:01,599
The-The time has come
to tell you...

1266
01:59:01,703 --> 01:59:03,603
I am John Smith.

1267
01:59:03,705 --> 01:59:06,196
Well, I am
not Pocahontas.

1268
01:59:06,307 --> 01:59:08,798
I'm Linda Pendleton,
and I want to see my UncleJervis.

1269
01:59:08,910 --> 01:59:10,810
- Linda. Linda.
- Well, w-

1270
01:59:10,912 --> 01:59:12,812
- Hello, my dear.
- Hello, UncleJervis.

1271
01:59:12,914 --> 01:59:14,814
Now how did you know
I was back?

1272
01:59:14,916 --> 01:59:16,975
I have a very nice spy
who works for you.

1273
01:59:17,085 --> 01:59:20,521
- That doesn't surprise me a bit.
I am surrounded by spies.

1274
01:59:20,622 --> 01:59:23,318
UncleJervis, I have
a dreadful problem. I must talk to you.

1275
01:59:23,424 --> 01:59:25,324
Go right ahead.

1276
01:59:25,426 --> 01:59:28,361
- Oh, I have no secrets from Griggs.
- Well, I have.

1277
01:59:28,463 --> 01:59:31,557
Thank you. Thank you very much,
Miss Pendleton.

1278
01:59:31,666 --> 01:59:33,566
I am so glad
to be out of something.

1279
01:59:33,668 --> 01:59:35,568
- Well, don't go far.
- Hmph!

1280
01:59:35,670 --> 01:59:38,833
Sit down, honey. Tell me.
Uh, what's on your mind?

1281
01:59:41,743 --> 01:59:44,837
UncleJervis, I'm in love,
and I want to get married.

1282
01:59:44,946 --> 01:59:48,712
Well, there's no problem there.
Sounds very nice and natural.

1283
01:59:48,817 --> 01:59:51,445
Mother's very much against it.
She doesn't approve of him.

1284
01:59:51,553 --> 01:59:54,716
Well, if your mother doesn't approve,
you've probably made an excellent choice.

1285
01:59:54,823 --> 01:59:57,314
Why don't you just elope?
Or is that too old-fashioned?

1286
01:59:57,425 --> 01:59:59,393
No, but I would like
a big wedding.

1287
01:59:59,494 --> 02:00:02,395
Silly of me, I suppose,
but I'm only planning to be married once.

1288
02:00:02,497 --> 02:00:05,261
- That is old-fashioned.
- Don't joke, UncleJervis.

1289
02:00:05,366 --> 02:00:07,425
I thought perhaps
if you talked to Mother...

1290
02:00:07,535 --> 02:00:11,266
told her how well he's doing at the lab,
what a wonderful future you see ahead for him...

1291
02:00:11,372 --> 02:00:14,637
well, she might forget
that his father manufactures overalls.

1292
02:00:14,742 --> 02:00:18,007
I think she's afraid his whole family
will attend the ceremony in overalls.

1293
02:00:18,112 --> 02:00:20,580
Uh, Linda. Linda.

1294
02:00:20,682 --> 02:00:24,743
Uh, you couldn't by any chance
be speaking of oneJimmy McBride?

1295
02:00:24,853 --> 02:00:26,753
The one and only.

1296
02:00:26,855 --> 02:00:29,824
Jimmy McBride and you?

1297
02:00:29,924 --> 02:00:33,690
How perfectly wonderful.
l-lt's sensational.

1298
02:00:33,795 --> 02:00:35,820
But tell me.
Uh, uh, when and how?

1299
02:00:35,930 --> 02:00:37,989
I got him on the rebound,
UncleJervis...

1300
02:00:38,099 --> 02:00:41,694
- but I got him, and that's all that I care about.
- Well, congratulations, my dear.

1301
02:00:41,803 --> 02:00:44,897
Your mother will give you the biggest
wedding this town has ever known.

1302
02:00:45,006 --> 02:00:46,940
- Do you think so?
- I know so. You know why?

1303
02:00:47,041 --> 02:00:49,566
- Because I'm going to pay for it.
- Oh, thank you!

1304
02:00:49,677 --> 02:00:52,840
I hope you'll be very happy.
Now, make a list of the presents you want.

1305
02:00:52,947 --> 02:00:54,847
A long, long list.
Don't stint.

1306
02:00:54,949 --> 02:00:57,918
- You're only doing this once, you know.
- Oh, UncleJervis, I love you.

1307
02:00:58,019 --> 02:01:01,011
- I love you. If you'll excuse me, I'm expecting-
- Of course. I understand.

1308
02:01:01,122 --> 02:01:03,420
Oh, oh. Listen, honey.
Uh, how is, uh-

1309
02:01:03,524 --> 02:01:05,424
Uh, how- how is Julie?

1310
02:01:05,526 --> 02:01:07,426
- Julie Andre?
- Mmm.

1311
02:01:07,528 --> 02:01:12,090
She's- Oh, she's having the most
dreadful time. She's terribly unhappy.

1312
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:14,100
Is she?

1313
02:01:14,202 --> 02:01:16,864
I thought you'd be glad to hear that.
Good-bye, UncleJervis.

1314
02:01:16,971 --> 02:01:18,871
- Good-bye. Good-
- Thank you.

1315
02:01:18,973 --> 02:01:20,941
Thank you.

1316
02:01:25,947 --> 02:01:28,381
- Griggs.
- Yes?

1317
02:01:28,483 --> 02:01:31,247
- Have I been rude to you?
- Most.

1318
02:01:31,352 --> 02:01:33,843
Forgive me.
You're utterly charming.

1319
02:01:33,955 --> 02:01:37,823
You're a little fat boy with wings
and a bow and arrow, and I'm very fond of you.

1320
02:01:37,926 --> 02:01:40,690
Mmm. You're a dandy.

1321
02:01:45,233 --> 02:01:47,997
Here we are.
This is where he lives.

1322
02:01:49,504 --> 02:01:53,167
- Who shall I ask for?
- Don't worry about it. You're expected.

1323
02:01:54,909 --> 02:01:57,935
Thank you, Miss Pritchard.
Thank you for everything.

1324
02:02:18,366 --> 02:02:20,266
- Miss Andre.
- Yes.

1325
02:02:20,368 --> 02:02:23,667
May I take your coat?
Wait just a moment, please.

1326
02:02:23,771 --> 02:02:25,671
<i>- As we continue to view-
- Thank you.</i>

1327
02:02:25,773 --> 02:02:27,673
<i>this truly remarkable
collection of art...</i>

1328
02:02:27,775 --> 02:02:31,211
<i>one feels more and more
a sense of debt toward its donor.</i>

1329
02:02:31,312 --> 02:02:33,507
<i>Now we come to
some of the impressionists...</i>

1330
02:02:33,614 --> 02:02:37,277
<i>a group of painters who have always
been a subject of great controversy.</i>

1331
02:02:37,385 --> 02:02:41,116
<i>Their break with the past was viewed
with great horror by the academic school...</i>

1332
02:02:41,222 --> 02:02:44,123
<i>who had for so long
reigned supreme in French art.</i>

1333
02:02:45,393 --> 02:02:47,361
This is a Renoir.

1334
02:02:47,462 --> 02:02:50,727
Actually, it is a painting of the daughter
of the marquis de Marineau...

1335
02:02:50,832 --> 02:02:54,666
and was said to
have been done in 1894.

1336
02:02:54,769 --> 02:02:57,431
Will you please
stay with the group, miss?

1337
02:02:57,538 --> 02:03:00,473
- Me?
- We cannot have people wandering off by themselves.

1338
02:03:00,575 --> 02:03:02,975
I must insist that
you stay with the rest of us.

1339
02:03:03,077 --> 02:03:06,513
<i>Renoir is famous
for his paintings of children...</i>

1340
02:03:06,614 --> 02:03:08,582
<i>but this is
one ofhis finest.</i>

1341
02:03:08,683 --> 02:03:11,516
<i>Here we have a Corot.</i>

1342
02:03:11,619 --> 02:03:14,611
<i>- In this painting, the foliage,
far more than any signature-</i>

1343
02:03:14,722 --> 02:03:16,917
proclaims the painter.

1344
02:03:20,194 --> 02:03:22,992
- Note the rich use of browns and yellows.
- Jervis.

1345
02:03:23,097 --> 02:03:27,591
<i>A truly fine example
of Corot at his best.</i>

1346
02:03:28,636 --> 02:03:32,367
<i>For him, the countryside was
a constant source of inspiration.</i>

1347
02:03:32,473 --> 02:03:37,103
<i>The homely, rustic scene is brought
to life here with great sensitivity.</i>

1348
02:03:37,211 --> 02:03:39,111
Hello, Julie.

1349
02:03:39,213 --> 02:03:41,113
<i>Hello.</i>

1350
02:03:41,215 --> 02:03:44,616
- What are you doing here?
- Shh! Quiet, please. Quiet.

1351
02:03:46,087 --> 02:03:50,581
- Do you know my guardian?
- Oh, yes. Yes. Very well.

1352
02:03:50,691 --> 02:03:54,388
- Oh. You never told me before.
- He asked me not to.

1353
02:03:54,495 --> 02:03:58,090
But I knew you were coming here today,
and I had to see him first because...

1354
02:03:58,199 --> 02:04:01,259
there was something
very important I wanted to ask him.

1355
02:04:01,369 --> 02:04:04,065
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
as is customary, we conclude the tour-

1356
02:04:04,172 --> 02:04:08,472
- I'm so happy to see you again.
- with the Pendleton family portraits.

1357
02:04:10,178 --> 02:04:13,011
Here we have the portrait
of the firstJervis Pendleton...

1358
02:04:13,114 --> 02:04:15,981
painted by
James Abbott McNeill Whistler.

1359
02:04:20,822 --> 02:04:23,552
<i>Jervis Pendleton II sat, or-</i>

1360
02:04:23,658 --> 02:04:26,422
<i>stood, as you can see,
forJohn Singer Sargent...</i>

1361
02:04:26,527 --> 02:04:29,655
<i>whose portraits are hung in every
important museum in the world.</i>

1362
02:04:40,074 --> 02:04:42,474
This is
Jervis Pendleton III...

1363
02:04:42,577 --> 02:04:46,013
who, as you can see, has broken with
the family tradition somewhat.

1364
02:04:48,116 --> 02:04:51,085
Well, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
That concludes our tour.

1365
02:04:51,185 --> 02:04:53,153
Thank you very much.

1366
02:04:56,958 --> 02:04:58,926
Oh, miss. The tour is o-

1367
02:04:59,026 --> 02:05:02,757
Oh. I beg your pardon, sir.
Yes. Of course, sir. Good day, sir.

1368
02:05:07,068 --> 02:05:09,628
Tell me.
When you saw John Smith...

1369
02:05:10,872 --> 02:05:12,840
what did you ask him?

1370
02:05:12,940 --> 02:05:15,704
Since he's your guardian,
I felt I should ask his permission...

1371
02:05:15,810 --> 02:05:18,244
before asking you
to marry me.

1372
02:05:18,346 --> 02:05:20,837
Oh. What did he say?

1373
02:05:20,948 --> 02:05:22,882
He said I'd have to
wait my turn-

1374
02:05:22,984 --> 02:05:25,646
that he wants to
ask you himself first.

1375
02:05:25,753 --> 02:05:28,051
Ah.

1376
02:05:28,156 --> 02:05:30,124
Well, why don't you?
