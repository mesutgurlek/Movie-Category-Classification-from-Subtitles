1
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,853
<i>Are you wearing old dreams</i>

2
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,865
<i>Breaking out at the seams</i>

3
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,163
<i>They should be new</i>

4
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,829
<i>And have I got the bargain</i>

5
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,238
<i>You lucky people you</i>

6
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:19,802
<i>Here's a hollyhock scent
that makes a lady or gent</i>

7
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,507
<i>Feel well-to-do</i>

8
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,142
<i>And the price
fits your pocket</i>

9
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:28,585
<i>You lucky people you</i>

10
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:33,592
Now here's
a green velvet landscape

11
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,993
And to prove
I'm no rogue

12
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:40,294
I'll add
a smart-looking rainbow

13
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:43,096
Something that's
always in vogue

14
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,137
I've a wonderful buy

15
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:49,005
In a wraparound sky
of moonlight blue

16
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,771
And it's yours
for a love song

17
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:56,578
You lucky people you

18
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,482
That's for nothing, folks,
and probably worth it too.

19
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,112
But inside is the big show.

20
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,452
If you're in the market
for a thrill...

21
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,618
and if you wish to witness
the most hair-raising,

22
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,162
spine-tingling,
bloodcurdling spectacle...

23
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,698
ever presented on
the continent of Africa,

24
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:15,359
don't fail to see
Fearless Frazier.

25
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,903
Fearless Frazier,
the living bullet!

26
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,735
Hurry, hurry.
Come over, come over.

27
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,241
Think of it, folks.
This human torch,

28
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,971
this indomitable character,
soaked in kerosene and...

29
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:29,446
shot through a flaming hoop of
fire far into the ocean. Chuck!

30
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,507
What's the matter? It's
Fearless. He fainted again.

31
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,644
Give him the smelling salts.
As I was saying...

32
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,417
<i>this character,
this man with nerves of steel,</i>

33
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,981
<i>is shot through
a flaming hoop of fire.</i>

34
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,289
Come on, Fearless.
Come on, boy.

35
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,092
Come on, Fearless.
There you are.

36
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,099
You're gonna be
all right.

37
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,499
Oh, swell.

38
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,503
Why do I do this?
Why do I do it?

39
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,938
You oughta see the mob outside.
You're gonna clear 100 bucks.

40
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,602
That's why I do it.

41
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,544
Hey. Where were
you last night?

42
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,173
I left you a note. Yeah,
out with your grandmother.

43
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:06,412
Mm-hmm. Your grandmother crawled
into bed with me at 4:00...

44
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,613
and had lip rouge
all over his face.

45
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,622
<i>Right this way, folks.</i>

46
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,817
Step lively now.

47
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,861
There he is,
the mighty Fearless Frazier.

48
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:19,922
Douse your cigarettes. Fearless
is covered with kerosene...

49
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,695
<i>from the tip ofhis head
to his 12 double A's.</i>

50
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,669
And when he hits
the fiery hoop in midair,

51
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,604
<i>he will burst into flame
before your very eyes.</i>

52
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:31,770
Come back next week. My partner's working
on an idea to make me explode in midair.

53
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,778
That's not a bad
idea at all, Fearless.

54
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,872
I had to open my big mouth.
Are you ready, Fearless?

55
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,884
Ready?
Hmm?

56
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:42,251
I don't mind being drafted,
but not as ammunition.

57
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,654
We have to be careful
how we aim this instrument.

58
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:49,161
Last week we were two feet off
and we sunk the S.S. Idaho.

59
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,288
We went right through "Ida" and
there wasn't much left of"ho. "

60
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,060
Yo-ho.
Ho.

61
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,567
Folks, one mighty charge
from this little derringer...

62
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:59,628
and Fearless Frazier
will fly so far and so fast...

63
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:03,699
that his head will arrive by
streamliner and his feet on a local.

64
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,835
If it's all the same to you,
I'd like a photo finish.

65
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,473
All right, folks,
Fearless Frazier flies again.

66
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,950
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it!

67
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,044
Okay.

68
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:18,488
Ready, little lady.
Roll the drums, please.

69
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,924
All right, folks.
Everybody watching?

70
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,554
The living bullet is on his way.
Here we go!

71
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,962
Ohh!

72
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:31,499
That concludes the first
part of our performance.

73
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,664
Now we all repair
to the riverbank...

74
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,073
where we hope to find the mighty
Fearless unscathed and unharmed.

75
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,134
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

76
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,872
Ah, there's
my little man.

77
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,510
Won't you come in? I
don't want to crowd you.

78
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,851
Everything all right? We have to
have more room when the baby comes.

79
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,823
Don't pull that lever so
fast. What's the matter?

80
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:56,293
You're gonna open the trap door
and the dummy will come out.

81
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:59,024
Nobody will know the
difference. Come on, here we go.

82
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,089
Wait for my legs.
Here we go.

83
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:04,102
All right.
We got it.

84
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,638
Hey, you all right?
I feel fine.

85
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,674
Woop!
I feel fine.

86
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:11,904
You all right? You got
a pint of blood with ya?

87
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,776
I don't know how you
"Svengalied" me into this.

88
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:19,147
It took my mother three years
to get me to eat spinach.

89
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:23,018
Three minutes of talk from you and I'm
getting fan mail from casket companies.

90
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,023
Here's some
fan mail for you.

91
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:28,925
Do you know that 94 of those federal
diplomas clinked into our till?

92
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,020
There's some music for
you. Oh, sing out loud.

93
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:35,329
Just 94. What is the total?
I'll get into the department.

94
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,892
We have plenty of happy cabbage. How much?

95
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,336
Look at that.
5,200 skins.

96
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,738
Those ever-loving
Morgenthau mashnotes.

97
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,471
Beginning to add up, isn't it?
We'll have enough to pay the tax.

98
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:49,003
Stick with me and if you live,
we're gonna do all right.

99
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,176
Well, we can't miss...

100
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:15,130
Hey, where you going?
Just going.

101
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,142
I know you're going,
but with who?

102
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,203
With "whom. " That's proper.
Don't give me that stuff.

103
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,441
I want to know with who. With grandmother.

104
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,883
She told me to give you
the brush.

105
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:30,116
<i>Come here.
There's a fire!</i>

106
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,884
<i>Somebody must've dropped
a cigarette.</i>

107
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,325
Let's get out of here.
Yes, indeed. We gotta go.

108
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,296
Beat it! They're after ya!
Who's after what for which?

109
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:43,233
Our dummy went through the big top and
the carnival's on fire. Ohhh! Let's go.

110
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,293
Our week
was up anyway.

111
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,896
Don't come this way. They're
after you. Go the other way.

112
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:51,671
What is this? A bus station?
Wait! Bring the cannon!

113
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,679
I'll get the cannon!
Get the cann...

114
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:10,128
We take this light bulb, courtesy
of the Nairobi electrical outlet.

115
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,562
And we place it in
the mouth of the subject.

116
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:17,433
Engineers have agreed that 500
volts is fatal to a human being,

117
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,063
but Fearless is going
to take 1,000 volts.

118
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,403
Are you ready?
Here we go.

119
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,353
All right, folks.
Hurry! Come over!

120
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:42,224
See Fearless Frazier, the human
bat with only man-made wings.

121
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:47,733
Give 'em a flutter. His fierce
character will climb 100 feet.

122
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,826
Like a swallow from Capistrano,
he will soar to earth...

123
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,633
in a perfect
three-point landing.

124
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,215
All right, men,
bring it around here.

125
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,549
Right down here now.
Easy. Woop.

126
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,555
Wait a minute.

127
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,083
<i>Just sit it in there.</i>

128
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,890
<i>Careful, now, woop.
Careful, now.</i>

129
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,931
<i>Woop, look out, men.</i>

130
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,523
<i>You all right?</i>

131
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,570
Get that bench in the corner
and put it on the bench.

132
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,764
Get this one up here.
There we go.

133
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,467
<i>Woop. Look out. Christmas cards?</i>

134
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,136
Huh?
Set it right there.

135
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,543
Here you are.

136
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,549
Hey, where you been? I've been shopping.

137
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:41,576
I know, but where?
Wait'll you see what I got.

138
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,214
There's a million bucks inside,
a million bucks!

139
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,224
How long can you
hold your breath?

140
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:49,352
<i>I don't know. I never tried. Well, try it.</i>

141
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,692
<i>Why?
Try it.!</i>

142
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,140
How long did I go?

143
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,976
Get that outta here!
It's an octopus!

144
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,710
That's what she is.
The greatest idea I ever had.

145
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,412
Get this for a setup.
We'll build the tank bigger.

146
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,217
We'll dress you up like a pearl
diver... little sarong or something.

147
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,589
Then you wrestle with him like
you did with Bonzo the bear.

148
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,595
Remember how we cleaned up?
It'll be terrific.

149
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:27,531
Fearless Frazier wrestles
with the terror of the deep.

150
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,661
No, sir. Wait, I mean
when you're feeling better.

151
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,570
That thing's got eight arms.
I only got one-and-a-half.

152
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,540
What's the matter with
that? I don't like the odds.

153
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,543
We'll snip
a couple off of him.

154
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,579
Wrestle an octopus? Me? Yeah.

155
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,945
Those things are murderous.
That ain't spaghetti he's waving.

156
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,041
Besides, they're poison.
They spit ink.

157
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,382
<i>You can wrestle and write
home at the same time.</i>

158
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,581
I've had enough.
I can't do it.

159
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:54,114
Ah-ah-ah!
Junior, never say "can't. "

160
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,388
You can do anything
you think you can do.

161
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:59,260
You told me I could fly
and look, a broken wing.

162
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,732
You tried to land downwind.
You can't do that.

163
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:06,704
Why don't you slip in some night
and just put a shotgun to my head?

164
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,900
Boy, you're slipping.
You're really slipping.

165
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:13,503
I'm trying to make a big fellow outta
you. They'll write books about you.

166
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,571
I know three words that won't
be in them: "ripe old age. "

167
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,810
It's a cinch. We'll train him. Train him?

168
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:22,285
I'd look fine swimming with a chair
and a whip. You can't train an octopus.

169
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,722
They only know one thing. Grab you
quick and suck the blood out of you.

170
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,918
How would I look
with no blood?

171
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,928
Just the same.

172
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,930
Why not train him to knit? Knit?

173
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,796
He could work on four
sweaters at the same time.

174
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:38,860
I'm ashamed of you, afraid of
a poor little thing like this.

175
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:42,305
The man I bought him off of
raised him from a polliwog.

176
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,502
Look, I'll show you
how gentle he is.

177
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,943
Come on, boy.
Come on.

178
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,947
Come on here.

179
00:10:56,722 --> 00:11:00,351
Just for that you go back to the
fish store. How do you like that?

180
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:04,328
Go ahead.
Write a letter.

181
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,131
Now, listen, Fearless, I've
given it a lot of thought.

182
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,769
We get a boa constrictor.
We stun him.

183
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:24,179
You go in there with a lasso and hogtie
him. I'll tell him when he comes in.

184
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,708
We've been kicking around the world for
five years two jumps ahead of trouble.

185
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:31,814
I'm homesick! I wanna get back to
Birch Falls and my relief checks.

186
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,349
You'll wind up in Barney Dean's
Beanery blowing up bloodwurst.

187
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,862
If we're gonna go home,
let's go home loaded.

188
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,957
They'll have a band meet us. And
they'll be playing an awful slow tune.

189
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,933
What's this?

190
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:55,640
Hey, what do you think we are, a couple
of round haircuts? We ordered beer.

191
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,343
Compliments of Mr. Kimble. Who's that?

192
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,875
Mr. Kimble, Kimble Diamond
Mines. That's him in the box.

193
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:04,149
Cheerio!
Hurray!

194
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,851
Good health.

195
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:10,885
You know the big yacht in
the harbor? That's his.

196
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,897
That's ours?
Mm-hmm.

197
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:16,128
It's on the cuff.
Pour, brother, pour.

198
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:21,105
Ha-ha-ha. Charles, must you
send champagne to strangers?

199
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,801
They're not strangers.
They're Americans.

200
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:27,243
They look like nice fellows.
I bet they'd be fun to know.

201
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,771
Say, you know,
it's not bad stuff.

202
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,251
Piper Heidsieck '28. Yeah,
but pipe her "heidsieck. "

203
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,812
Si vous voulez voir
la ville avec moi

204
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,586
Un taxi nous attendra

205
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,457
Oh, no, now, Junior.
Here, here.

206
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,396
Let's get in the mood. It's
a little rich for your blood.

207
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,263
You might break out in a
rash. That's what I want,

208
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,701
one of the larger rashes
if you don't mind.

209
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,331
Ah-ah-ah. Ahh.
That happy juice.

210
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:58,536
Daddy, the bubbles make my
nose tickle. Ooo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

211
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,342
Was that at this table? Go ahead, drink up.

212
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:05,872
Please, Mr. Inspector,
we do not want the police here.

213
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,818
We are running a first-class
place. Don't be disturbed.

214
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:12,756
It's a matter south of here.
I'm looking for two Americans.

215
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:16,693
<i>Hey.
They burned down a carnival.</i>

216
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:20,630
In fact, they nearly
burned down the town.

217
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:24,465
A votre santé, monsieur.
A votre santé? Oui, oui.

218
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:32,244
Ahh ahh
de avec fromage

219
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,871
A-zing-zing-zing
A-zing-zing-zing

220
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,006
Ha-ha-ha!

221
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:40,540
All right, that's enough.
Wait. We work here.

222
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:43,713
I am sorry. My partner,
she and me, we "worka" here.

223
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,916
Your pardon.
He not speak good English.

224
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,188
I only been in this
country short time. Oui.

225
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:52,890
We are performers in the show.
Artists. Tou jours I'amour.

226
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,899
Will you pardon? We blow. Danke schoen.

227
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,935
We must perform now. Eau de cologne.

228
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,562
Bon voyage. Je t'adore. Je t'adore.

229
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,765
Whoo!

230
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,332
It's them all right. Of course, it is.

231
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,810
Let 'em go.
They can't get out.

232
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:21,623
Hey, hey, look out.
The house is sold out.

233
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,060
No autographs.

234
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:48,185
Tough audience.
Yeah.

235
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,228
We gotta get out of here. What
are we gonna do? I don't know.

236
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:13,642
I got an idea. Mesdames and
messieurs, my partner and I...

237
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,646
Attention, please.
Attention, please.

238
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,614
Attention, ha-ha.
Attention.

239
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,117
My partner and I will
give our impression...

240
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,154
of two orchestra leaders
meeting on "ze" boulevard.

241
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:27,124
Two orchestra leaders
meeting on ze boulevard.

242
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,431
Leopoldo!
Arturo!

243
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,899
How do you do? How are things with you?

244
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,902
Well, Leopoldo,

245
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,201
you know how it is in
the concert business.

246
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:45,539
People are not going to concerts
like they did in the old days.

247
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,545
But I think
it will pick up.

248
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,138
I got some wonderful horns
with the big fat tone.

249
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,446
They play mellow.
And my violas, Leopoldo.

250
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,148
I tell you every viola
player is an "arteest. "

251
00:15:57,222 --> 00:16:01,386
When I think about violas, I
get so excited I can hardly talk.

252
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,089
And tell me, Leopoldo,
how are things with you?

253
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:09,199
I have a
pretty good band.

254
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,566
I have the finest aggregation
on the continent.

255
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:16,973
I tell you I have the greatest
oboe players. And I have cellos...

256
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,340
Did you say cellos?
I said I have cellos.

257
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,845
I pay my "celloists"
much more than you do.

258
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,348
Arturo! I've got
the greatest cellos!

259
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,611
<i>All right, that's it.</i>

260
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,218
What are you
arresting them for?

261
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,592
They burned down a carnival.
I'll pay for the carnival.

262
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,266
My name's Kimble. I don't
care what your name is.

263
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,475
Pretty tasty, aren't they? This is it.

264
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,477
Wonderful guy,
that Kimble.

265
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,604
He got us out of
a ticklish situation.

266
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,275
If it wasn't for him, we'd still
be in the brig. What a tired brig.

267
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,683
Now we can pack and get back
to Birch Falls, huh? No hurry!

268
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,052
Listen, I'll go over
to the hotel and pack.

269
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:07,581
We'll go to Birch Falls.
But relax a while.

270
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,253
Go get the tickets.
I'll pack.

271
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,456
Let's forget the whole
thing. You know what?

272
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,830
What is it? We ought to catch Johannesburg.

273
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,131
Let's get killed, huh?
Great town, Johannesburg.

274
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,296
Remember how we go down
there? Oh, wonderful.

275
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,772
I've got the greatest idea
I've ever had. I know you have.

276
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:26,834
We get a lead coffin.
Put you in the coffin.

277
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,472
Seal it up tight and
throw it in the lake.

278
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,778
Seal it with me inside?
Don't want no water in there.

279
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,149
How do I get out? I
haven't worked that out.

280
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,848
If you don't want to go home,
I'll go alone.

281
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,153
How much do I owe?
Four kolaks.

282
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,160
For what? That shredded wheat?
This is not shredded wheat.

283
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,287
It's malo-palo.
Malo-palo? What's that?

284
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:49,391
Malo-palo is
candied grasshoppers.

285
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,926
Wait. Did I hear right? What
did you say? Grasshoppers.

286
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,713
I'll get the tickets.
I'll hop over to the hotel.

287
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:08,114
<i>There we are, boys.
Now for a snappy landing.</i>

288
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,748
<i>Keep her Moored here.
I'll be back in 15 minutes.</i>

289
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,760
<i>Hello, Chuck.</i>

290
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,659
Well, Mr. Kimble, hi.

291
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:20,254
How's me old Chuck?
Very fit, very fit.

292
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,994
I don't think I've ever had
a better time than last night.

293
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,036
We really broke it up,
didn't we?

294
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:29,336
Stick with us. Compound
fractures, anything for a laugh.

295
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,535
Thank you for getting
us out of the brig.

296
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,807
I'd hate to think of a couple
of cheery blokes like you...

297
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,974
disintegrating
in a dark, damp dungeon.

298
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,917
Not a very happy
forwarding address.

299
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,614
What are you doing now?
I'm going to get tickets.

300
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,522
We're going back to the
States. That spoils everything.

301
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,322
I like you two and
I want to do something for you.

302
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:53,490
What about coming to my yacht and
having a drink? I want to talk to you...

303
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:56,966
about something you two
will be interested in. Yeah?

304
00:18:57,035 --> 00:19:00,402
I want to get my tickets.
I'll look after that for you.

305
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:07,241
There's no place
like home

306
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,606
Well, Fearless,
wait'll you hear what I got.

307
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,617
Outside rooms on "A" deck? No, no.

308
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:16,085
That costs dough.
You remember Kimble?

309
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,214
Yeah, but let's have the
tickets. I ran into him.

310
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,418
That's the main issue. You're
gonna kiss me when you hear this.

311
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:26,089
Hear what? I got to thinking we
should be in some legitimate business.

312
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,895
Something sound, conservative.
I was telling Kimble.

313
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:32,198
He agreed with me and
let us in on a little thing.

314
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,398
Let us in on what?

315
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:37,601
I guess you'd
call it a diamond mine.

316
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,735
Never mind what you guess
I'd call it. What is it?

317
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,211
A diamond mine.

318
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,816
Keep your head now. Hold onto
yourself. Don't get excited.

319
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:50,286
What did you say?
We got a diamond mine.

320
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,017
Ha, ha, it's hot for you,
isn't it? No, I'm all right.

321
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,116
Tropical sun.
Take it easy.

322
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,162
The man in the
white coat will be here.

323
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,163
I got the documents,
the map, the rights, the deeds.

324
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,165
They're all signed,
sealed and delivered.

325
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:05,363
Kimble gave you a diamond
mine? He couldn't give it.

326
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,803
He said that would
involve the corporation.

327
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,865
We had to pay him
a little something.

328
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,741
A little something?
How much?

329
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:17,748
Well, roughly...
How much? How much?

330
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:20,307
About five grand.
Five grand?

331
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,081
Half that dough is mine.
It took years.

332
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:27,091
I killed myself to get it...
four times!

333
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,095
Oh, you're a great
little kidder.

334
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,631
Cheery Chuck.
That's funny.

335
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,224
You had me upset
for a while.

336
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:40,362
When do we sail? I'm not
kidding. We got us a diamond mine.

337
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,169
Yeah, we got a...
diamond mine! Where is it?

338
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,144
It's one of those things. It hasn't been
worked for centuries. It's kinda lost.

339
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:50,579
All we gotta do is find it. That's a cinch.

340
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,982
You just whistle.
Put an ad in the paper.

341
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,043
Give me the papers. Hey,
hey, where you going?

342
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:59,147
I'm gonna get our dough back
and stick Kimble in a thimble!

343
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:02,250
Wait a minute!
Now, wait! Wait a minute!

344
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,261
I want my money. You're gonna crab the gag.

345
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,729
You oughta see the yacht
this fellow's got.

346
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,665
I could have a yacht, if I
could run into a yokel like you.

347
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,363
Wait, you heard
what the waiter told us.

348
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,371
Everybody knows him.
He's a philanthropist.

349
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,407
I don't care who he votes
for, I want my money.

350
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:19,273
Here comes the owner of the
hotel. I'll leave it to him.

351
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:23,280
Mr. Saunders, could we see you? Certainly.

352
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,511
Do you know Mr. Charles Kimble?
Kimble? Of the Kimble Mines?

353
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,519
I should say so.

354
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:31,522
The family is one
of the richest in Africa.

355
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,683
Even before
they rooked us?

356
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,557
Why don't you trust me?
I know what I'm doing.

357
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,791
Yes, Charles,
charming fellow.

358
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,993
Delightful company.
Loads of fun.

359
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:47,232
He's a little eccentric,
of course.

360
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:51,140
But, you know after all... Wait, what
do you mean he's a little eccentric?

361
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:56,112
He has a certain weakness
for signing papers.

362
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:59,309
Not that his signature
is any good.

363
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:04,048
If the family didn't watch,
Charles would sell you anything.

364
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:07,182
Anything? He'd even sell
one of his diamond mines.

365
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,989
Give me the papers.
Wait, wait!

366
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:23,540
I'm sorry,
Fearless.

367
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:27,203
He was such a nice fellow.
There it goes. 5,000 bucks.

368
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,770
Blood money squeezed
out of my arteries.

369
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,976
I met his sister. He showed me
corporation papers and things.

370
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:37,078
How was I to know he was wacky?
Looked as sane as you... saner.

371
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:40,352
This is the end
of everything between us.

372
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:44,452
For years I've been breaking my neck
'cause you asked me, 'cause we were pals.

373
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,930
Now, you toss away
our money.

374
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:52,197
I've stood for plenty, but now
I'm through. Know what I mean?

375
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,204
Now, look.
Look here, Junior.

376
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,638
We've been through a lot
since we were kids.

377
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,642
We've been through
thick and thin.

378
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,644
I never figured it was
your dough or my dough.

379
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,704
I thought everything
belonged to both of us.

380
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,683
What about that blonde in
Brooklyn? You didn't want a share.

381
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,686
You wanted to be
the whole corporation.

382
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,688
You wound up as
the holding company.

383
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:14,157
Let's forget about those
things. Let's forget about you?

384
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,626
I'm loaded with your treatment. I'm fed up.

385
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,754
I don't care where you go
or what you do.

386
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,596
Just forget about me, huh?
Get yourself another pigeon.

387
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,779
Hey, Chuck, come here. I
thought you walked out on me.

388
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,479
Don't be silly. I could walk
out on my right arm easier.

389
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:49,726
<i>Let's see now.
600 bucks for the tickets.</i>

390
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,729
The hotel bill.

391
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,391
Fifty for you.
Fifty for me.

392
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:58,869
Fifty here. Fifty there. Look,
we've never done nothing crooked.

393
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,838
We agreed. We did have
to go up the sleeve.

394
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,637
But we give the sucker
a fair shake for his sugar.

395
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,007
We never robbed nobody.
We never cut nobody's throat.

396
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:11,071
Fifty there.
How'd that five get in there?

397
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:14,585
- Fifty. Fifty.
- Where'd you get that money?

398
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,587
Don't worry.
I got it legitimate.

399
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,919
I was getting a drink in a dive.
There were a couple of fellows.

400
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,550
They were loaded. Naturally,
I struck up a conversation.

401
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,560
What are you getting
at? Wait'll you hear it.

402
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,688
We had a few drinks
and to get down to cases...

403
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:29,256
I unloaded that phoney
diamond mine on them. You what?

404
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:32,030
I sold 'em that mine. I got
our dough back, five grand!

405
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:35,698
- Who's operating now?
- I can't believe it.

406
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,743
It was a case of superior mind
arguing them into it.

407
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,574
That... and the Mickey
I managed to slip them.

408
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,910
Come on. Get your things.
Let's get going.

409
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,110
What's the hurry? Those fellows,
they might be a little mad.

410
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:49,119
Besides, my rabbit's foot
just crouched.

411
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:52,418
Let's move on, huh? Oh, no
hurry. We're in good company.

412
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:56,052
You amaze me. This is a
talent I didn't know you had.

413
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,219
- What kinda fellows were they?
- Well, they were...

414
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,295
That's the kind of fellows.

415
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,875
Here, here.
Leave that stuff...

416
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,706
Hiya.

417
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,876
You are not thinking of
walking out on us, are you?

418
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:24,012
Oh, no, we were just figuring
on taking a short jaunt.

419
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:28,890
We might toddle to the country.
We gotta see a sick tiger.

420
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,929
Your sick tiger
has got to wait.

421
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:35,091
Just a minute, friend.
Who are you?

422
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,100
We have mighty good reasons. You have?

423
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:39,932
$7,000 worth
of good reasons.

424
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,304
$7,000...
you told me five.

425
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,605
Oh, the other pocket.
There's more?

426
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:49,135
The interest mounts up fast. I
was gonna surprise you. How nice.

427
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,081
<i>I'm afraid your friend
hasn't told you everything.</i>

428
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,916
He promised to take us
to a lost diamond mine.

429
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,478
What kind of diamonds
are in it?

430
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,151
Lost diamonds.

431
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,694
<i>He tells us he is the only
one who knows where it is.</i>

432
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,925
Oh, yes, I knew that.
He runs over there quite often.

433
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:10,092
I have a tough time
keeping him away from the joint.

434
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:15,105
That's fine. Now, there is
only one thing I want to know.

435
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:20,678
When do we start?

436
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,679
When do we leave,
Fearless?

437
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,612
Uh, well...

438
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,878
It's Tuesday now.
Yeah, all day.

439
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:30,581
You couldn't come back
about Friday afternoon, late?

440
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:34,751
One more of your jokes
and Solomon, here,

441
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,529
will tear out your insides...

442
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,533
and the birds will carry
them home to their young.

443
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,627
<i>How do you like that? I
think it's rather good.</i>

444
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,264
It's a nice switch.
This time the bird gets you.

445
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,707
Get your clothes.
You are going with us.

446
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,675
We're going with them.
We're going with them.

447
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,874
We're going with them.

448
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,918
Patty cake, patty cake,
baker's man.

449
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,386
Bake a cake
as fast as you...

450
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:08,053
- He must have seen the picture.
- Get him.

451
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,060
Ohhh!

452
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,348
Chuck!

453
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:39,816
This must be the nowhere that
everyone is always 500 miles from.

454
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:43,156
Why did you have to hop us
on a boat going the wrong way?

455
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:47,460
With those two guys after us, I'd have
hopped on a turtle if it'd been moving.

456
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,625
A couple of more days here
and I'm gonna be punchy.

457
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:52,192
Don't go wolfing at me.
I didn't get us into this.

458
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,431
Did I sell Lebec
the mine or did you?

459
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,565
You bought it, or I
wouldn't have had it.

460
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,836
If I didn't have it, I
couldn't have sold it. Umm.

461
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:02,073
And if I didn't sell it, we
wouldn't be here, would we? Uh-uh.

462
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,081
I don't get it.

463
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,208
<i>Psst.!
Hey, hey, up here.</i>

464
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:09,515
Come up here,
will you, please?

465
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:12,385
- Both of us?
- Yes, it's a matter of life and death.

466
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:15,221
Death.
Yeah, but for who?

467
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,318
No, for whom.

468
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:20,728
Please do and hurry.
It's the third door.

469
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,824
Let's not go for this.
Wait, wait.

470
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:25,199
You've been beefing about it
being dull. Here's some action.

471
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,238
Come on.
Oh, now...

472
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:36,978
Come on, you follow me... in
front. Fearless Frazier, huh?

473
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,778
Come in.

474
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,623
Sit down, please.

475
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,067
Get a load of
that stale character.

476
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:00,332
What are we in? A duck blind or something?

477
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,396
Sit down.

478
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,342
I don't smoke.
He don't smoke either.

479
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,616
You're Reardon and you're
Frazier, is that right?

480
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,118
Yeah, how'd you know? What's
with you? What's your racket?

481
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:19,850
- How much money have you got?
- That's that.

482
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,587
How much? We haven't got anything.

483
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:25,561
We're tapped out.

484
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,724
We ain't working. Besides,
we got a lot of relatives...

485
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,291
who ain't working who got a
lot of relatives. Big family.

486
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:40,170
We're killing her.
Wait, she's crying.

487
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:42,713
You're not gonna go for
that crying dame routine.

488
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,715
They want to wipe their eyes
on your bankroll.

489
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,217
Don't you want to hear
what it's about? Wait.

490
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:51,654
Honey, honey,
what's the matter?

491
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:56,859
I have a friend
who's in serious trouble.

492
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,055
Yeah?
What kind of trouble?

493
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,031
Donna,
that's my friend.

494
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,568
Donna and I were on our
way into the interior...

495
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:08,072
when a terrible thing
happened. What happened?

496
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,836
We were captured
by slave traders.

497
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,174
Are you ready?

498
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,237
- Please.
- Honey, what are you selling?

499
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,284
We're not kids out of the sixth
grade. What happened to the fifth?

500
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,444
Well, you were...
look...

501
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:31,088
You're in Africa now.
Strange things happen here.

502
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:34,660
This is a horrible place.
Really, it's terrible.

503
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:36,893
The whole magilla here,
isn't it?

504
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:39,937
If you were both captured,
how is it you're loose?

505
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,029
They didn't want me.
Oh, naturally.

506
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,472
I mean, that's too bad. Nice out.

507
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,602
If I had any money, I'd buy
her freedom. I wouldn't ask you.

508
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,479
Take us to her. Where is
she? This way, I think.

509
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,104
Hiya, hiya, hiya.

510
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:17,141
There she is.
There's Donna.

511
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:22,036
<i>Very rakish, huh?</i>

512
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:26,880
That's it. Let's get her.
No, you've got to bid.

513
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:30,751
She's gonna come high too.
Let's get a down payment.

514
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:34,053
Bounce the whole thing on the
barrel head. The lump, huh?

515
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:40,863
She has, hasn't she? I wouldn't know.

516
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:43,492
- 20 kolaks.
- 25 kolaks.

517
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:47,026
<i>- 30 kolaks.
- 40 kolaks.</i>

518
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:49,198
What's a kolak?
It's about six bits.

519
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,936
50 kolaks.

520
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,978
50 kolaks!

521
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:58,174
What was the price?
50 kolaks.

522
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:02,413
Is that F.O.B. Detroit?
Shhh. One of the newer models.

523
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,352
Hiya.

524
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,686
Here she is now.
Here's Donna.

525
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:18,157
Oh, bid, bid. Say something. I will, wait.

526
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:21,467
Hey, 5 kolaks.
5 kolaks.

527
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,099
35 kolaks.

528
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:27,042
Uh, 40 kolaks.

529
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,944
Fifty.
50 kolaks.

530
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:33,313
60 kolaks.
70 kolaks.

531
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,545
71 kolaks.
75 kolaks.

532
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,554
76 kolaks.
77 kolaks.

533
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,920
78 kolaks. What are we
doing? Who are you with?

534
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:44,325
- 120 kolaks.
- A-ha.

535
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,363
120 kolaks.

536
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,867
Let me get at
that capitalist.

537
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:59,173
150 kolaks. One
hundred and... ha-ha-ha!

538
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:02,679
He's ticklish. Stay with him. 150 kolaks.

539
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:06,740
50, 50, 50,
bongo. American.

540
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,013
Bongo, we made it. Right here, dear.

541
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:12,420
Pay the man, Junior. You
handle all the good stuff.

542
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,458
How many kolaks?

543
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,429
Sticky, ain't it?

544
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,961
Let's get you out
of those things.

545
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:28,005
I think they're overdoing
this slave bracelet thing.

546
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,472
There we are.

547
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:33,840
Ah, bongo. How can I ever repay you?

548
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:37,847
It was nothing. What do you
mean? It cost us 150 Polkas.

549
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:39,883
What's that? Two beers. Are you kidding?

550
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,920
You can pay us. We're not
proud. Walk home with me.

551
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:47,117
I'd be glad to. We'll see you
later. Half the money was mine.

552
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,024
You can walk halfway.
Half...

553
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:52,289
I wonder if
the sale's over.

554
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,297
<i>Come back here.</i>

555
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:58,062
What kind of a shuffle is this?
Halfway!

556
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,678
Fifty.

557
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,414
Sixty.

558
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:14,417
Seventy.
Seventy-five.

559
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:18,285
75 for you,
75 for me.

560
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:22,190
You very smart girl.
Very clever idea.

561
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,160
Ideas are all
we've got.

562
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:28,187
Baby, have I got food! What'd you get?

563
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,257
All the vitamins
from "A" to "Z."

564
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:33,565
I'll take "A" and be
satisfied with that.

565
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:37,438
Well, it worked okay.
We'll eat for a while.

566
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:40,136
What happened
to Zeke and Lemuel?

567
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:44,011
Prepare yourself for a shock.
How's your heart?

568
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,142
It'll feel better when I wrap
this goose liver around it.

569
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,743
Do you know how much money
those two boys had?

570
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,619
Not $100.
Nobody's got $100.

571
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:56,956
- $7,000.
- Water.

572
00:34:57,028 --> 00:35:02,432
Just let me look at it. Let me get
my hands on it. Now, wait a minute.

573
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,231
They're not that easy.
But listen to this.

574
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:10,070
They're taking us cross-country
to young Bradley.

575
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:13,110
You trying to tell grandma
they'd lug you across country...

576
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,168
so you can marry
the Bradley bankroll?

577
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,976
They don't know about that.
I put on an act.

578
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,415
They think they're taking
me to see a dying father.

579
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:23,477
He's an ivory trader.

580
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,488
You're really improving.

581
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:28,024
That's better than the yarn
you gave young Bradley.

582
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:32,290
I managed to squeeze out tears.
I made 'em trickle down.

583
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,425
What are we doing going
into a jungle with dames?

584
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,334
They'll start hanging unto our
necks and screaming... or vice versa.

585
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:42,236
If there's any screaming,
I'll know who to blame.

586
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:45,605
If they spend our dough, you're gonna
hear plenty of screaming from me.

587
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,644
She gives you
a baby stare...

588
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,044
and you're reaching into
your pocket for my dough.

589
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:54,813
The kid was crying so hard
she could hardly talk.

590
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:58,117
An American girl too. Where's
your red, white and blue blood?

591
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:02,057
I ain't waving it every time
I see a big pair of brown eyes.

592
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,924
<i>I had to help her.
I'd do that much for a dog.</i>

593
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,430
A dog don't sell you an idea
of going on a safari.

594
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:11,025
A dog don't eat three meals a day and
there's no chance of marrying a dog.

595
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,093
Ah-ah-ah,
you're in the tree tonight.

596
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,196
Oh, not again.
Oh, yes.

597
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:19,107
Oh, please. There we go. That's a big man.

598
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:23,238
You mean you're going into the
suite again. I'm very happy here.

599
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:25,805
Everything's comfortable
for you? I like it here.

600
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:28,511
Just ring if you need anything.
I wouldn't want to bother you.

601
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:31,077
A cup of cocoa
or something.

602
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,919
Make yourself comfy. Yeah, that's
what I like about you, 50-50.

603
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,687
That's a big man.
Ha, ha, ha.

604
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,752
Don't worry about me.
Ha, ha, ha.

605
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,763
You all right?
Who's there?

606
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,095
You all settled
and cozy and comfy?

607
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,431
Let's have a nice,
Frank, open discussion.

608
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:48,233
We might as well
go out on a safari.

609
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:52,402
Look, I'm not going on any
safari. It's a great hideout.

610
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,376
Let's hide somewhere.
Let's go back.

611
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,436
Back?
How we gonna go back?

612
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:59,210
If we're lucky enough
to get through those cops,

613
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:02,116
we gotta face Lebec and that 7-foot
character with the toad-stabber.

614
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:07,123
<i>You want any piece ofhim? No, I guess not.</i>

615
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:11,389
Well, so far, safari.

616
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:19,901
Donna, have you got the bags?
Yes, it's here. It's all set.

617
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:23,930
I'm not too fussy. This
will do for me. Ah-ah-ah.

618
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:27,637
I'm not fussy. You're in the
observation car in the rear.

619
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:30,237
How about this? This is mine.
Been in the family for years.

620
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,646
My folks are old safari
people from South Dakota.

621
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,947
How about me? You catch
a zebra and ride in.

622
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,385
I just swing it from tree
to tree. Do the best you can.

623
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:40,754
Mr. Livingstone, can I see you?
I'm sending out the laundry.

624
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,487
Keep in touch with me, will you? Okay.

625
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,654
Give me a hand with the
trunk. Get your head down.

626
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,823
My head?
You're gonna carry it.

627
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:50,264
What about the Porters?
It's full of valuables.

628
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:53,531
I'm not gonna trust it to
them. Boys, give it a lift.

629
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,971
Mush on, men.
Give it a big right rudder.

630
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:07,678
Ma-toum-bom-ba

631
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:23,993
Ma-toum-bom-ba

632
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,405
Ma-toum-bom-ba

633
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,840
Ma-toum-bom-ba

634
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,921
Ma-toum-bom-ba

635
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,550
<i>Ma-toum-bom-ba</i>

636
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,681
Warm skies

637
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:26,025
The cry of a wild bird

638
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:31,467
The murmuring shadows

639
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:37,804
That hide in
the deep tangled wood

640
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:43,245
<i>The wind
softly whispers</i>

641
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:49,514
<i>That it isn't far
where enchanted orchids are</i>

642
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:53,387
<i>This is thejungle
Thanks!</i>

643
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:57,188
And the road
to Zanzibar

644
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,354
<i>Ma-toum-bom-ba</i>

645

646
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,865
<i>Ma-toum-bom-ba</i>

<i>Ma-toum-bom-ba</i>

648
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:25,581
Lions may roar
leopards may growl

649
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:30,525
Savages may
shout and holler

650
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:35,258
But outside of that
it's peaceful

651
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:40,668
<i>And a gentleman
needn't have a dollar</i>

652
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:45,698
The trees
deal in magic

653
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:51,715
And a guiding star
can't help you where you are

654
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:56,048
Romance may happen

655
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,715
On the road
to Zanzibar

656
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,781
<i>Ma-toum-bom-ba</i>

657

<i>Ma-toum-bom-ba</i>

658
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:27,077
Hey, this is okay.
Not bad.

659
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,312
We'll probably start
an auto camp here.

660
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:32,116
- Mr. Frazier, bwana.
- I don't wanna bwana.

661
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:34,123
Men want money
before sleep.

662
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:37,354
I paid them last night, the night
before and the night before that.

663
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,692
What, do they got slot
machines around here?

664
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:42,698
Might as well pay them, unless
you want to follow the swallows.

665
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:46,566
Think they got a union?
Union! They got muscles too.

666
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,510
Hey.

667
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:57,308
Here.

668
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,815
Sticky, ain't it?

669
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:11,191
- Fearless.
- Yeah?

670
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:15,722
Fearless, I wonder if...
I can't call you Fearless.

671
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:18,529
What's your right name?

672
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:24,668
Hubert.
Oh.

673
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:28,075
Fearless, I wonder if
you'd do something for me.

674
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:31,478
Oh, sure, anything...
within reason.

675
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,517
Sit down.

676
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,117
Nervous?
No, a splinter.

677
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,488
There.

678
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,997
Now, I want you to try
and forget that I'm here.

679
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,998
Try and forget
you're here?

680
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,557
Yeah.
Oh.

681
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:58,231
Your smile
is much too wise

682
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:01,005
You're dangerous

683
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:06,748
You kiss me
with your eyes

684
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:08,978
You're dangerous

685
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:11,578
Sure you have
the right fellow?

686
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:15,557
My heart
gets so excited

687
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:19,357
It's thrilled
for a change

688
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:24,129
And simply because
you're charming

689
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:27,967
Now isn't
that strange

690
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:32,907
You know
that moon too well

691
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:36,845
You're dangerous

692
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:41,476
Why any fool
can tell

693
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:44,043
You're dangerous

694
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:50,855
And with your
arms around me

695
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:55,058
I should call
for aid

696
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:59,432
You're dangerous

697
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:03,963
But who's afraid

698
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:06,236
Me!

699
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,870
Now, wait a minute.

700
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:18,616
Ooh, you're dangerous.
Chuck!

701
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:23,854
You kiss me
with your eyes

702
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:27,693
Oh, you're dangerous

703
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:32,998
My heart
gets so excited

704
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:37,006
It's thrilled
for a change

705
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:41,738
And simply because
you're charming

706
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:45,213
Now isn't
that strange

707
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:50,777
You know the moon
too well

708
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,948
Oh, you're dangerous

709
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:59,929
Why any fool
can tell

710
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:03,558
You're dangerous

711
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:08,367
And with your arms
around me

712
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:12,466
I should call
for aid

713
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:17,242
<i>You're dangerous</i>

714
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:24,413
But who's afraid

715
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:31,019
Does that do anything
to you, Mr. Frazier?

716
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:34,622
No, nothing at all.
Well, good-bye.

717
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:44,906
What's the idea? What are you
turning the heat on him for?

718
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:47,967
Just practicing.
Practicing? Oh!

719
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:51,310
I haven't seen Bradley in weeks.
He might have cooled off.

720
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:54,111
I wanted to see what kind
of effect the song had.

721
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,754
Hey, Chuck?
Hmm?

722
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:01,450
I want you to do
something for me.

723
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:05,017
What is it? I'm kind
of worried. It's Donna.

724
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:09,122
She's gettin' romantic notions and I
don't want any entangling alliances.

725
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:12,760
I want you to put in
a bad word for me.

726
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,701
I wouldn't worry, Junior,
you can handle it.

727
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,708
I know how
these dames work.

728
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,711
First thing you know,
she'll be getting cold,

729
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,771
and she'll come up
and snuggle next to me.

730
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:35,952
See what I mean? Don't know how you do it?

731
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:38,824
It's chilly,
isn't it?

732
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:43,492
Are you comfortable? Yes, thanks.

733
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:48,095
Look at that moon. It's as big
as a million-dollar gold piece.

734
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:50,766
It's funny. I'm just
beginning to notice it.

735
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:53,571
It's pretty,
isn't it, Junior?

736
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,738
The moon routine...
opening maneuver.

737
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,873
What did you say
your father was doing...

738
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,974
<i>in the middle
of thejungle?</i>

739
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:04,418
I thought I told you.
He's a rubber trader.

740
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,548
Your girlfriend said
he was an ivory trader.

741
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:13,126
Well, he is.
He trades rubber for ivory...

742
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:16,792
and ivory back again
for more rubber, you see?

743
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:19,028
Comes out
even, huh?

744
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:21,866
Leave Donna alone.
She's had trouble enough.

745
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:24,635
She's takin' it like
a little soldier too.

746
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:27,302
Little soldier in
the old army game.

747
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:29,709
You're in pretty solid
with this kid,

748
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,248
but I think I can
sabotage you.

749
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:35,251
Don't scuttle me. I wouldn't
do it for anybody but you.

750
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,253
I know
you wouldn't.

751
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:41,280
Oh, my.

752
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:45,761
You about ready to go to
sleep, baby? I'll be along soon.

753
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:49,196
Wouldn't you like me
to fix you a cup of tea?

754
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:52,963
No thank you. But look what I found!

755
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:56,267
<i>Bradley's tea. It's your
favorite brand, remember?</i>

756
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:00,743
All right, Julia,
if it'll make you happy.

757
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:02,836
Well, come on.

758
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:06,781
Good night, Chuck.
Good night, Hubert.

759
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,444
Hubert?
Is that you?

760
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,646
I told her
everything.

761
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,555
Wait a minute.
Where's my other leg?

762
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:17,287
I think it's in your other pants. Oh, yeah.

763
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:22,389
She's just usin' you to get
to me. You're a riot, Hubert.

764
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:26,800
I had a gal in Birch Falls. You know
what she did to get me on the hook?

765
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,703
She was runnin' around with
a sailor to make me jealous.

766
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:32,765
I used to send her candy, furs,
jewelry, and things like that.

767
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:35,607
And she used to send them
back with nasty notes.

768
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:39,479
Thought I didn't get it. She's probably
still carrying a terrific torch for you.

769
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:42,412
<i>What was that?</i>

770
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:46,582
It's just an owl or
something. Go to sleep. An owl?

771
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:50,957
<i>What was that?</i>

772
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:54,259
Me! Come on, will you go to sleep?

773
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:56,265
I will.

774
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:59,666
What're you gonna do with
that? It's just for propaganda.

775
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:03,934
Couldn't hit anything with it.
But I could worry 'em a little.

776
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:09,670
Boy, I'm nervous.
Hey, I'm shaking!

777
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:13,773
I was so nervous, the bed is still
shaking. Go to sleep, will ya?

778
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:16,318
Oh, no wonder.
Look, it's a snake.

779
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:19,219
<i>Snake?
Yeah, snake.</i>

780
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,223
A snake!

781
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:26,962
<i>And so, at daybreak, our little
band of intrepid adventurers...</i>

782
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,498
<i>sets forth on its
perilous journey...</i>

783
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:32,228
<i>into the mysterious,
unfathomablejungle.</i>

784
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,561
<i>Week after week,
they plod onward...</i>

785
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:40,440
<i>with nothing to guide them but the
stars by night and the sun by day...</i>

786
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,502
<i>and their own inherent
sense of direction.</i>

787
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:47,778
<i>Over mountains,
through marshes, over rivers...</i>

788
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:50,513
<i>Why, they've been
over that river before.!</i>

789
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:52,851
<i>Something's gone wrong here.
Oh, this is terrible.</i>

790
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:55,858
<i>Why are they going that way?
If I could only tell them.</i>

791
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:59,623
<i>No, no, no.!
Not that way. Turn back.!</i>

792
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:02,790
<i>Well, at last they're
back on their course again.</i>

793
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:05,061
<i>Day after day,
theyjourney onward,</i>

794
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:09,094
<i>cutting a trail deeper and deeper
into the uncharted interior.</i>

795
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:14,542
<i>Onward and onward, unaware of the
dangers that lurk on every side.</i>

796
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:17,705
<i>Suddenly, there's a tense moment
as they come face-to-face...</i>

797
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:19,749
<i>with the terror of
the dark continent...</i>

798
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:22,614
<i>a charging rhinoceros.!</i>

799
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,621
<i>The ground trembles beneath
5,000 pounds of death on the hoof.</i>

800
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,782
<i>But dauntless
and unafraid,</i>

801
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:31,350
<i>our courageous four
hold their ground.</i>

802
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:37,433
<i>Shaken by their narrow escape,
they come to the Masaka River.</i>

803
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:50,503
I know you, old boy. You and your
moonlight walks. Don't you worry about that.

804
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:56,683
If Donna wants to, let her
slap my face. Come here.

805
00:50:56,753 --> 00:51:01,122
What? I shaved. What's
this? Your eyes are all red.

806
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:05,218
Just a minute. You're crazy.
Just the white part is red.

807
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:08,458
Guess it's my imagination. I'm ready.

808
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:11,023
That and with what
Thonga's been saying.

809
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:13,831
What does Thonga know?
He's no doctor.

810
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,031
Well, don't wait up...
Thonga's what?

811
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:19,768
Go ahead now. Have a
good time, enjoy yourself.

812
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:22,937
What was it? A lot of white
men have come down with it...

813
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:26,278
and a lot of them have gotten
over it. They haven't all died.

814
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:29,750
What're you doing?
What're you tryin' to sell?

815
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,812
Thonga's been saying you might
be coming down with malaria.

816
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:35,653
I don't think so. Me?

817
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:39,183
Are you kidding? I'm one of
the healthiest men around here.

818
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:44,998
What is that, Chuck? This is
a little malarial preventive.

819
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:47,593
I thought I better take some.
I've been exposed now.

820
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:51,437
I gotta rush on... You look
all right. Have a good time.

821
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:55,342
Even if you have anything, it's
just a very mild case. Yeah.

822
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:57,846
So long.

823
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:01,006
Say, Chuck,

824
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:03,712
I thought I'd take a dose
before I started.

825
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,778
It'll pick me up
a little.

826
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:08,051
That's the last dose. The last dose?

827
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,320
I better take it. I
think I'd better have it.

828
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:12,327
I'm operating this
safari and I think...

829
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:16,855
I'm the man with the pink eyes.
I'd better go for it. There we go.

830
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:19,458
Take it all.
That's a good boy.

831
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:24,432
Makes you feel better.
That's good.

832
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:27,306
What is that? It's a mild sort of sedative.

833
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:30,005
Sedative!
Yeah.

834
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,413
That'll make me sleep! I gave you a
double-header. It shouldn't hurt you.

835
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:39,388
I got a date with Donna. I gotta
be peppy. I'll make up your bed.

836
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:43,552
Why do I listen to you? I gotta
take something. Take a nap.

837
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:47,119
I gotta be... Come on,
Junior. La da Dee Dee

838
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:49,688
Why do you
do this to me?

839
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:54,703
Da da Dee Dee da There. Why
do I want to listen to you?

840
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:05,242
Oh, what a night!

841
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:08,341
What a moon!
What a girl!

842
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:14,323
<i>Must be more to it than this. What does
a fella do now? You could read poetry.</i>

843
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,791
I could if I had
a book of poetry.

844
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,420
I could play a guitar
if I had a guitar.

845
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:23,296
If you knew how to play one. How
about a nice mixed green salad?

846
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,398
This reminds me
of a picture I saw once.

847
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:31,099
A fellow and a girl
in a canoe.

848
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:34,007
Just like we are...
only he was paddling.

849
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:35,374
Showing off?

850
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:38,676
Yeah, and out of a clear sky
he started to sing a song.

851
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:41,114
What's wrong with that? Nothing.

852
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:44,950
But what killed me is that from
nowhere an orchestra started...

853
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:47,956
Violins and everything right
in the middle of the jungle.

854
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:51,460
I think I can top that.
I saw a picture once...

855
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:53,962
Same situation...
a boy and a girl in a canoe.

856
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:56,931
She was paddling.
Show-off?

857
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,298
All of a sudden he sticks
his hand in the water...

858
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:03,669
and out comes the sound of a harp,
out of the water. I don't believe it.

859
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:07,176
<i>It's a fact.
All he did was this.</i>

860
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,974
Did you hear something?
Uh-huh. Do it again.

861
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:13,842
What is this?

862
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,748
That's not bad. Now if you could
just take it down a halftone.

863
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,793
Okay, shorty!

864
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:30,890
<i>Orchestra, please.</i>

865
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:46,006
Whenever it's
early twilight

866
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:51,281
I watch 'til a star
breaks through

867
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:57,156
Funny, it's not
a star I see

868
00:54:57,227 --> 00:55:03,791
It's always you

869
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:09,897
Whenever I roam
through roses

870
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:14,103
And lately
I often do

871
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:21,650
<i>Funny, it's not
a rose I touch</i>

872
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:26,746
<i>It's always you</i>

873
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:33,923
If a breeze
caresses me

874
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:39,401
It's really you
strolling by

875
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:46,567
And if I hear
a melody

876
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:54,277
It's merely
the way you sigh

877
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:59,448
Wherever you are

878
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:03,049
You're near me

879
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:09,156
<i>You dare me
to be untrue</i>

880
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:16,468
Funny, each time
I fall in love

881
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:25,140
It's always you

882
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:54,069
Where have you been half the
night? And I don't believe it. Oh...

883
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:57,602
Just out, grandma.
Just out, huh?

884
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,514
I don't need any thermometer to tell
me that you're running a temperature.

885
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:04,144
Tomorrow, huh?
Oh, no.

886
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:07,189
I'm a little tired. We'll
take care of it right now!

887
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:10,522
You're marrying Bradley if
I have to climb the steeple...

888
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:14,359
and ring the wedding bells
myself. Can't we forget Bradley?

889
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:17,662
You wanna forget Bradley?
Now, you listen to me!

890
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:20,601
You're not going to pass up
the Bradley millions,

891
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:23,104
not for the other half
of a human cannonball!

892
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:25,107
All right, Julia!

893
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:29,009
If it'd make you happier, the next time
Chuck comes near, I'll sling mud at him!

894
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:32,878
Good! And I'll
hand you the mud!

895
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:36,975
Good night, baby.

896
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:44,249
Not too much muscle on
those duds. Leave it to me.

897
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:50,831
There we are. What did
you do to my best shirt?

898
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,961
What'd you do to your best pal?
You handed me a Mickey Finn!

899
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:58,701
Would I do that to you? You sure
would, if you were in the same spot.

900
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:01,710
All the time she was with you,
she was talkin' about me.

901
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:04,542
She was very unhappy
because you weren't there.

902
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:09,176
Cried, cried, and cried... on my
shoulder. That don't mean nothin'.

903
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:11,686
Being a gentleman
of the old school,

904
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:15,918
I slipped my arm around her, no
struggle. That don't mean nothin'.

905
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,927
With the moon and the stars
and one thing and another,

906
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:22,226
I sorta kissed her.

907
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:26,132
That don't mean nothin'. Did to me.

908
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:30,662
Listen, Buster, you're just the
come-on, the shill. I'm the shill?

909
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:33,573
You think she's gonna kiss
me to make you jealous?

910
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,770
You weren't there.
You didn't even see it.

911
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:38,780
Somehow you don't get it.
Don't you know why she does it?

912
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:43,182
Why's that? She knows you'll
tell me. You big blabbermouth!

913
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:50,885
Fearless, would you like to
take a little walk with me?

914
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:56,728
Huh? Oh, sure! I'll be right
with you. I can finish this later.

915
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:59,597
If you don't mind, I'd like
to talk to Fearless alone.

916
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:05,366
Alone?
Sure.

917
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:09,901
That's the way life is. Some fellas
got it and some fellas ain't got it.

918
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:13,908
Hey!
You got it!

919
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:16,417
I'm no different than
a lot of other guys.

920
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:21,287
I've knocked around, but then the
right one comes along and I'm hooked.

921
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:23,882
Not easy, mind you.

922
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:29,021
Fearless,
let's sit down.

923
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,968
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

924
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,167
You can fight it
all you want to,

925
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,507
but when love really
comes along, you're gone.

926
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,571
And it's
come along, huh?

927
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:49,884
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

928
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:54,014
Well, tell Hubert. What's whispering
in that little heart of yours.

929
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:59,926
Well, it's about Chuck. Oh.

930
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:02,191
No, don't go.

931
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:08,896
Last night I guess I was carried
away, gave him the wrong idea.

932
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:14,433
Now I'm worried. I want to be
fair with him, but you see...

933
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:19,375
There's
somebody else.

934
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:23,647
Oh. And now you wonder whether
you ought to tell Chuck?

935
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:28,214
Uh-huh, but it's kinda
hard for me to do, I...

936
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:34,230
How did you know? I know what girls are
thinking better than they do themselves.

937
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:37,858
What should I do?
I've got to tell him.

938
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:41,233
I like him so much, and yet
I... Listen, it's simple.

939
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:45,240
Don't worry. He already knows.
I've been tellin' him all along.

940
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:49,972
How did you find out? Right there.
I got a feeling for those things.

941
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:52,879
It shows all over you. I
knew the first time I met you.

942
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:57,113
And you told Chuck? I tried to, but
it's so hard to beat it into his head.

943
01:00:57,186 --> 01:01:00,178
He's one of the nicest fellas
in the world, my best pal,

944
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:02,383
but he's so
stuck on himself.

945
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:05,689
Thinks when he's around a girl,
they won't look at anybody else.

946
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:08,560
What do you think I should
do about it? Don't do a thing.

947
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:10,997
Leave it all to me.
I'll handle the whole thing.

948
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:15,470
Fearless, you're a darling. Yeah, I know.

949
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:17,631
<i>Donna?</i>

950
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:20,369
I think I better go.

951
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:25,471
Thank you, Fearless.
Aren't you coming?

952
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:29,040
<i>Not until my toes uncurl. Bye.</i>

953
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:41,262
Come on, come on. Put
that junk up, will ya?

954
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:44,561
Let's talk this over. This isn't
junk and I've got nothing to say.

955
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:48,297
I've gotta get it finished.
Should look very fetching on you.

956
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:51,772
I'm getting shoes and a
bag to match. I'd do that.

957
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:55,971
It's for a certain party. Token
of my steam. "Esteem" is the word.

958
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,707
No, steam.
I was hot that night.

959
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:01,477
Stop dropping these
veiled hints around here.

960
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,384
What's percolating up in
that single cell of yours?

961
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:07,082
It's what I've been
trying to tell you.

962
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:09,784
Donna doesn't care for you,
she's in love with me.

963
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:13,625
- She told you?
- If I might say, verbatim.

964
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:17,188
That's the silliest
thing I ever heard of.

965
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:20,064
How could she be
in love with you?

966
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:22,661
You talk like I'm a goon or something.

967
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,708
When I'm with women, I get
a different personality.

968
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:30,075
Sort of a Jekyll and Hyde. You
don't ever get them mixed up, do you?

969
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:33,138
You've been wonderful to me,
and I want to be fair with you,

970
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:36,481
because we like you...
but you know that's life.

971
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:40,181
Some fellas got it and some
fellas ain't got it... I got it.

972
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:44,420
Chuck, I wanna talk to
you. Why don't you knock?

973
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:46,519
What,
on canvas?

974
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:49,429
I'd like to talk to Chuck. Go ahead.

975
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:52,798
Chuck, sit down.
The lady wants to talk.

976
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:56,430
What I'm gonna tell you, it's for
your own good. Donna's, everybody's.

977
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:58,974
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

978
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,202
You're gettin'
Donna mixed up.

979
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:03,939
There's no use dusting
off the orange blossoms.

980
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:06,345
I've been giving him
the same routine.

981
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:08,440
She's in love
with somebody else.

982
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:11,954
You're hearing it with your
own ears. I've been tellin' him.

983
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:14,285
How do you know? She told me.

984
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:18,657
What is this, everybody tellin'
everybody else? Why don't she tell me?

985
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:20,889
She gets tongue-tied
in the moonlight,

986
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,488
but she's got one chance for
security and for happiness...

987
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:25,625
and I'm gonna see
that she gets it.

988
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:30,866
She's gonna marry Jay Theodore
Bradley if I have to use a shotgun.

989
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:35,573
Now, I guess you'll listen.
She's gonna marry Bradley...

990
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,772
Who? Hey!

991
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:41,943
<i>What do you mean she's
gonna marry Bradley?</i>

992
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:49,955
<i>Okay.! Okay.!</i>

993
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:52,654
<i>How do you like that,
she's got a guy.!</i>

994
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:55,390
Who? We're dumb. She's gonna marry Bradley.

995
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:58,228
Nobody's dying, you understand?
That's what kills me.

996
01:03:58,301 --> 01:04:00,292
Nobody's dyin'...
not even her father.

997
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:03,270
She never had a father.
We're suckers! No father?

998
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:06,365
She's hitchhiking on us,
spending our dough!

999
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:09,172
She's gonna marry Bradley,
that guy with the yachts!

1000
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:11,679
You could melt his cups
and have a million.

1001
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:16,013
We're the guys sailing. Take it
slower, about eight-to-the-bar.

1002
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:19,486
What was that? She's gonna marry
Bradley, the guy with the boats.

1003
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:23,013
And I'm stringing the beads! I saw you.

1004
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:25,652
He tells her to come,
but she has no dough.

1005
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:28,390
We step into the picture,
loaded with dough. We're big men.

1006
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:30,659
We had dough.
They're gone.

1007
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:33,167
We're cooked. Wish I was dead. So do I.

1008
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:37,229
How about that trouble with
the slave market? All a phoney!

1009
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:39,433
We're supposed
to be smart gees!

1010
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:42,272
Where do you think those
dames are from? Where?

1011
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:45,280
<i>Brooklyn, and they did it to us! Oi, vai.!</i>

1012
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:49,546
What're we gonna do? We'll have
her dodging all the way to Brooklyn!

1013
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:51,587
Come on!
How do you like that?

1014
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,990
Hey, Donna,
come here.

1015
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:59,084
Wait a minute.
I'll get her.

1016
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:03,030
She's not here.
Not here?

1017
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:06,034
Thonga, did you see Miss Donna? Miss Donna?

1018
01:05:06,102 --> 01:05:08,536
She go that way.
Come on.

1019
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:37,164
Help! Help!

1020
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:39,667
<i>Somebody help.!</i>

1021
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:43,535
Wait. Do we know what we're
doing? No, but come on.

1022
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:49,978
- Help!
- Donna?

1023
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:56,210
Donna?
Donna?

1024
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:59,254
<i>It's her clothes.</i>

1025
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:05,754
The leopards! They've
killed her! It can't be.

1026
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:07,762
Oh, Donna.

1027
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:10,128
She was so pretty.
Just a kid.

1028
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:13,327
<i>We shouldn't have
let her go out alone.</i>

1029
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:15,996
<i>It's our own fault.</i>

1030
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:18,632
<i>Who's gonna break
the news toJulia?</i>

1031
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:21,973
Somebody's gotta tell her. Yeah. Somebody.

1032
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:27,772
This is all there is
left of her, I guess.

1033
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:31,047
Not even an ear,
nothin'.

1034
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:34,351
Gee, what hogs
those leopards are.

1035
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:37,119
Want to take this
stuff back to camp?

1036
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:39,661
No, let's bury
it right here.

1037
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:42,459
Sort of make the ground...
Make the ground hallowed, huh?

1038
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:46,365
Yeah, that's the stuff. That's
a nice thought, Fearless.

1039
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:50,166
Only moments ago we were
talking together, laughing.

1040
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,766
You know, sometimes when the
light hit her just right...

1041
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:57,279
<i>she was the prettiest thing
I've ever seen. Yeah, I noticed.</i>

1042
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:01,305
And a couple of minutes ago we were
gonna tell her where to head in.

1043
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:05,480
When I think of what she did
to us, that Bradley thing!

1044
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:11,015
If I'd have gotten my hands on
her, I'd have... Fearless, not now.

1045
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:14,085
We have to rise above
these petty things.

1046
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:16,097
Yeah.

1047
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:20,363
When I think what she did to us,
it's so hard to rise.

1048
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:39,110
Maybe you oughta
say a few words, huh?

1049
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:42,214
Yeah. A poem would be nice.

1050
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:45,522
You know any poems?
Me?

1051
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:53,232
"A bunch of the boys were whooping
it up at the malamute saloon,

1052
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:56,237
and the kid that was playing... " No. No.

1053
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:58,273
Don't fit, huh?

1054
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:01,138
"'Twas a balmy
summer's evening,

1055
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:04,008
and a goodly crowd
was there... "

1056
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,878
No? There must be other poems.

1057
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:11,147
Might be better if I just
said what I feel. Yes.

1058
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:14,621
Donna, I've only
known you a short time,

1059
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:18,091
but in that short time you've...
you've crept into my heart.

1060
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:21,220
What's the matter with me? She
crept into both of us. Donna...

1061
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:23,595
<i>it's true
you lied to us.</i>

1062
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:27,432
That's just too bad. You
didn't have too, you know.

1063
01:08:27,503 --> 01:08:30,995
You could've... I don't
know why she did it.

1064
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:33,064
I've never heard of
such a filthy trick.

1065
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:35,667
<i>Carting us
across thejungle,</i>

1066
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:38,178
<i>spending our dough
and lying like that.!</i>

1067
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:40,477
She didn't
have to do it!

1068
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:44,041
If she'd come out with it,
we'd have helped her! Yes.

1069
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:48,284
Not once did she tell us...
Chuck! We gotta rise above it.

1070
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:50,655
<i>I'm sorry. Even though she's wrong...</i>

1071
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:54,457
We gotta rise.
We gotta rise.

1072
01:08:54,530 --> 01:09:00,628
Donna, good-bye. Chuck, doesn't
seem like a funeral to me.

1073
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:02,637
<i>Maybe you oughta
sing a hymn.</i>

1074
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:07,642
Maybe if I just sang our song? That's nice.

1075
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:10,941
Whenever it's
early twilight

1076
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:14,107
I watch 'til a star
breaks through

1077
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:19,281
It's funny,
it's not a star I see

1078
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:23,519
It's always you

1079
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:25,856
Come in,
Fearless.

1080
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:29,728
Wherever you are
you're near me

1081
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:33,996
You dare me
to be untrue

1082
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:39,598
It's funny, each time
I fall in love

1083
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:45,011
It's always you

1084
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:49,449
<i>If a breeze
caresses me</i>

1085
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:54,114
<i>It's really you
strolling by</i>

1086
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:58,354
<i>And if I hear
a melody</i>

1087
01:09:58,427 --> 01:10:00,395
<i>It's merely...</i>

1088
01:10:00,462 --> 01:10:04,364
<i>The way you sigh Hey, hey, look here.</i>

1089
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:07,061
You're alive, huh?
I might've known.

1090
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:10,003
If I could find those
leopards, I'd sic 'em on you.

1091
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:12,597
What's the matter?
I was just having fun.

1092
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:16,338
She's buried and she's having
fun! A comical corpse, huh?

1093
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:19,381
<i>We know about Bradley
and you lying too.!</i>

1094
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:22,611
<i>You and that phoney slave market.! You
can't even get killed on the level.!</i>

1095
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:25,119
Anybody else would leave
you out in this jungle.

1096
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:27,678
But not us, we're the
better-type suckers!

1097
01:10:27,756 --> 01:10:30,020
You're right. We're gonna
give you the full treatment.

1098
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:33,653
Take Thonga and the
safari! And take the money!

1099
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:36,163
Take a powder! You can take Bradley too!

1100
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,166
And how
you'll take him.

1101
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,498
Give him our deepest
sympathies. He'll need it!

1102
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:44,300
That's tellin' her. That's
the larger-type brush.

1103
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:47,809
I never heard you go better. Very
seldom I give out with that routine.

1104
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:04,516
<i>Wouldn't you think
she'd come crawling...</i>

1105
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:08,154
on her hands and knees,
begging us to forgive her?

1106
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:12,894
Instead, she runs out on us.
All we did was tell her to.

1107
01:11:12,968 --> 01:11:16,404
Isn't that a woman for you every
time? Maybe Bradley was a bluff.

1108
01:11:16,472 --> 01:11:18,906
Maybe she saw I wasn't
gettin'jealous of you,

1109
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:20,908
so she rang in
a millionaire.

1110
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:23,206
You mean, there
was no Bradley?

1111
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:27,147
She travels across Africa
just to be with you? Could be.

1112
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:31,380
You're a riot. Fearless
Frazier, the great profile.

1113
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:33,648
Not bad from
the side, either.

1114
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:36,156
Come on, let's get out of
here. Where are we goin'?

1115
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:38,716
Anywhere where we can get
a boat back to the States.

1116
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:43,322
Now you're cookin' with gas. Which
way is that? Well, we came in...

1117
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:47,529
Here.
Here we go.

1118
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:49,764
Chuck,
where'd you go?

1119
01:11:56,745 --> 01:12:00,806
See any signs of life? Life?
This looks like a graveyard.

1120
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:04,444
Who built this? I don't
know. It wasn't beavers.

1121
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,750
Old Man Mose.

1122
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:14,792
Uh-oh!

1123
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:17,024
<i>What a way to
collect the rent.</i>

1124
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:19,829
Badly hurt.

1125
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:22,894
There's been a bit of
pig-sticking, dear boy.

1126
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:25,132
What's this?

1127
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:27,675
Come on. Let me hear from you.

1128
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:34,743
Hey.
What is this?

1129
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:38,651
This must have been some
party. We miss everything.

1130
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:42,282
Look at the drums!
Fearless!

1131
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:47,528
You remember him.

1132
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:51,192
Don't get up.

1133
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:54,030
<i>Look at this. Drums! Yeah.!</i>

1134
01:12:57,306 --> 01:12:59,297
How about this?

1135
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:04,344
<i>Good.!</i>

1136
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,312
Was I too
hot for you?

1137
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:59,530
What's that, an echo? Sounds like an echo.

1138
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:02,798
Let's try it.

1139
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:09,268
Hey...
that's no echo.

1140
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:12,279
You know what this is?
Ajungle telegraph office.

1141
01:14:12,347 --> 01:14:15,874
Jungle telegraph?
S.O. S... get us out of here.

1142
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:19,478
I don't know the code.
Well, fake it. Do something.

1143
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:23,290
Chloe!

1144
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:29,422
She's never around when you
need her. Let's try this here.

1145
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:33,326
Tell 'em
we need food.

1146
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:35,529
And a change
of linen.

1147
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:39,904
Get a big bus. We want to
get back to Birch Falls.

1148
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:52,678
Any messages for the folks?
Can you send over ten words?

1149
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:55,621
What was that? I just sent it collect.

1150
01:14:58,427 --> 01:15:01,089
Do you hear that?
What is it?

1151
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,597
I don't know.
We're not getting through.

1152
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:06,998
We're on the wrong wavelength.
Here, you try it once. I'll try it.

1153
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:09,503
Come and get us!

1154
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:37,056
You take it. I'm beat. Who, me?

1155
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:49,133
I'll try it on the little drum.
Yeah, get a different tone.

1156
01:15:52,581 --> 01:15:56,278
The boys are here.
They are?

1157
01:15:57,653 --> 01:16:00,349
You sent the wrong
message. It was intercepted.

1158
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:02,515
Hi, fellas.
Who's got the dice?

1159
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:24,741
What do you make of it? The way I figure,

1160
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:28,408
they think we're big shots, maybe
gods or something. I wish I was sure.

1161
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:33,554
What worries me is
all this trimming...

1162
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:37,991
Don't mean a thing. It's
like parsley on fish. Yeah.

1163
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:41,689
Looks like they're gonna
broil us like lamb chops.

1164
01:17:29,544 --> 01:17:35,141
Wait a minute! What do you want to
be? "The man who came to dinner"?

1165
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:57,566
Moon-face is for us, but old
ratchet-head's putting in an awful knock.

1166
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:29,102
Should we kiss the babies?
We're not running for anything.

1167
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:31,696
We've already
been elected.

1168
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:44,818
What's this?
That's gold.

1169
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:48,549
Cut yourself in, Junior.
I'm in there. Yes, sir!

1170
01:18:48,623 --> 01:18:50,818
Old pawnbroker.

1171
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:54,293
If this keeps up, we'll be
loaded. Try and act like a god.

1172
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:56,227
A god?

1173
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:59,426
<i>I said a god,
not a cod.</i>

1174
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:16,572
This is okay. This is
probably the 40-cent tour.

1175
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:20,012
These open-top cabs are the
thing, boy. Yeah, no meter.

1176
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:23,073
We're off
to see the wizard.

1177
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:25,381
I don't like the
looks of these.

1178
01:20:25,453 --> 01:20:27,887
Probably some of their
own boys killed in battle.

1179
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:32,052
This one's got a removable
bridge! Well, remove it.

1180
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:39,190
Yeah,
ghoul it.

1181
01:20:42,637 --> 01:20:45,606
Me? Probably wants me
to make a speech.

1182
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:48,472
Say a few words.
I'll be right back.

1183
01:20:48,543 --> 01:20:51,478
<i>This kid's a great
talker. Where's the stand?</i>

1184
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:54,037
This'll be all right.
I can speak here.

1185
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:58,518
Wait a minute!
Am I exhibit "A"?

1186
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:02,421
I guess they don't think you're a
god anymore. I'm big in Birch Falls.

1187
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:06,688
Wait, wait! Don't move. What're you doing?

1188
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:11,527
What're you talkin' about? Hinge!

1189
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,797
Hiya.
Listen...

1190
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,838
No! No!

1191
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:20,972
<i>Oh, no.!
Look out.!</i>

1192
01:21:26,014 --> 01:21:28,778
Get me out of here!
He'll kill me!

1193
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:32,411
<i>He'll tear me up like an old
blotter! It's a test of strength.</i>

1194
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:35,251
<i>They want you to wrestle him.! Wrestle?</i>

1195
01:21:35,323 --> 01:21:38,224
<i>Like Bonzo the bear.! Nothing but
hair and muscles! I can't wrestle that!</i>

1196
01:21:40,262 --> 01:21:42,025
Pour it on him!

1197
01:21:42,097 --> 01:21:46,466
Pour what, my blood? He's down! Go get him!

1198
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:50,527
Go ahead, go get him!
Climb on him, boy!

1199
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:05,547
Think you're playing with kids?
That'll teach you!

1200
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:07,918
You can't miss.
You're too scientific.

1201
01:22:07,989 --> 01:22:11,015
I got him!
I got him!

1202
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:14,186
Oops!
Positions reversed.

1203
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:18,263
No! Foul!

1204
01:22:19,868 --> 01:22:24,464
Chuck, do something!
Oh, my toes!

1205
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:26,973
Come on,
you fearless boy!

1206
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:29,636
<i>Chuck,
tell him to stop.!</i>

1207
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:36,150
Oh, you don't
like it?

1208
01:22:36,217 --> 01:22:38,811
I'll dig my way
out of here!

1209
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:40,821
Hey! Hey!

1210
01:22:43,425 --> 01:22:45,757
Now you're
working in there!

1211
01:22:45,827 --> 01:22:47,920
<i>Come on, boy.!</i>

1212
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:51,424
<i>Here you are.</i>

1213
01:22:51,499 --> 01:22:54,991
Beat it, Fearless.
Fly, boy!

1214
01:22:57,706 --> 01:23:01,938
- Keep working in there.
- Oh, Chuck!

1215
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:04,137
Keep working
in there, boy!

1216
01:23:04,212 --> 01:23:06,373
<i>Go ahead,
Fearless.!</i>

1217
01:23:19,894 --> 01:23:22,556
Monotonous,
isn't it?

1218
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:25,497
<i>Come on, boy.!
Now you're working in there.</i>

1219
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:28,035
- You're gonna outpoint him.
- Excuse me.

1220
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:29,502
<i>Now you got it.!</i>

1221
01:23:29,571 --> 01:23:33,473
Was that me? Get back in there
and pitch. You're gonna win!

1222
01:23:40,482 --> 01:23:42,473
Come on, fearless boy!
Take him! Hit him, boy!

1223
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:51,086
If I get this act to the States, it'll
kill them! What state will I be in?

1224
01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:54,617
<i>Light a match! Do something!
I haven't got any more.</i>

1225
01:24:24,259 --> 01:24:28,127
<i>Let the blood go
back in my head.!</i>

1226
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:55,654
I don't want
any more food!

1227
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:04,020
Hey, will you cut out
that chirping?

1228
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:06,659
You're driving me crazy
in this chicken coop.

1229
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:09,168
These guys dancin' and beatin'
those drums for days.

1230
01:25:09,237 --> 01:25:11,899
If they're gonna eat us,
why don't they do it?

1231
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:15,932
Don't be in a hurry, boy. You'll
be brisket of beef soon enough.

1232
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:18,501
Imagine me on the
65-cent blue plate.

1233
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:21,981
I think you're slated for
the businessman's lunch.

1234
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:25,042
Fearless Frazier,
the human meatball!

1235
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,521
I gotta get out of here. There must
be some way. Look out, look out.

1236
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:30,922
They'll grab an
hors d'oeuvre off you.

1237
01:25:35,029 --> 01:25:38,157
Well,
pardon yourself.

1238
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:39,962
Must've been
somebody he ate.

1239
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:43,561
That's life...
here today...

1240
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:46,266
and just a
burp tomorrow.

1241
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:53,347
I like it in here.

1242
01:25:53,414 --> 01:25:57,145
What about this? It's the last mile, boy.

1243
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:59,345
I'm telling you,

1244
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:02,321
I'll give you indigestion.
You won't like me!

1245
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:05,052
Think of something.
You're the big idea man.

1246
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:08,892
They're gonna make 4-minute eggs
out of us. He's had enough already.

1247
01:26:08,963 --> 01:26:11,431
Well, it's worth
a trial. Here.

1248
01:26:11,499 --> 01:26:13,990
Patty cake, patty cake
baker's man

1249
01:26:14,068 --> 01:26:17,504
Bake a cake
as fast as you...

1250
01:27:06,187 --> 01:27:08,781
<i>Now, listen. Don't nix this
thing until you've heard it.</i>

1251
01:27:08,856 --> 01:27:11,188
It might be the biggest idea I've ever had.

1252
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:14,057
You come out beautifully gowned
with sequins and spangles.

1253
01:27:14,128 --> 01:27:16,790
You flex your muscles,
and there you are...

1254
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:20,800
Mademoiselle Frazier, the
bearded lady. Are you kidding?

1255
01:27:20,868 --> 01:27:23,701
You think I want those
sailors chasing me? No, sir!

1256
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:26,205
You seem to have lost
all confidence in me.

1257
01:27:26,274 --> 01:27:30,142
Get me out of this Emile Zola and
get me two tickets home. What with?

1258
01:27:30,211 --> 01:27:32,236
The minute
I get off that boat,

1259
01:27:32,313 --> 01:27:34,747
I'm gonna grab a handful
of that U.S.A. and eat it.

1260
01:27:34,816 --> 01:27:37,376
Birch Falls! What're we gonna
use for money, personality?

1261
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:38,976
Money?
Come here.

1262
01:27:39,053 --> 01:27:42,147
What's this? You know
Fearless Frazier in a pinch.

1263
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:45,488
Solid gold. What did you
do, roll a prospector?

1264
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:48,495
When we were gods, the chief
put 'em around our neck.

1265
01:27:48,563 --> 01:27:50,588
Where've you had them? I hid them.

1266
01:27:50,665 --> 01:27:53,463
I got a secret panel in my
head. Room enough there for it.

1267
01:27:53,534 --> 01:27:56,401
Let's hock 'em, get
sharpened up and draped down!

1268
01:27:56,471 --> 01:27:58,405
And check
this beaver.

1269
01:27:58,473 --> 01:28:03,172
I'll have a shave if you can
find my face. Don't cut yourself.

1270
01:28:03,244 --> 01:28:07,681
How 'bout me getting the boat tickets
while you're losing that hedge?

1271
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:10,183
What's the matter
with waitin' for me?

1272
01:28:10,251 --> 01:28:13,186
I waited for you. There might
be a boat sailin' any minute.

1273
01:28:13,254 --> 01:28:15,688
I don't know about you
goin' alone for the tickets.

1274
01:28:15,757 --> 01:28:18,487
I think I'm old enough
to get a couple of tickets.

1275
01:28:18,559 --> 01:28:21,494
See you in the hotel
in a half hour, huh?

1276
01:28:32,674 --> 01:28:35,575
He said half an hour.
It's six hours already.

1277
01:28:35,643 --> 01:28:38,476
He's got 'em.
He must have the tickets.

1278
01:28:42,383 --> 01:28:45,113
Please let him
have the tickets.

1279
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:49,621
Maybe something happened to him. Nah.

1280
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:51,921
Maybe he drowned.

1281
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:55,053
<i>If he did drown, let them find
the tickets on him. Fearless.!</i>

1282
01:28:55,129 --> 01:28:58,326
<i>Wait 'til I tell you
what happened.!</i>

1283
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:00,799
Just wave the tickets at me
while you're doing it.

1284
01:29:00,868 --> 01:29:04,634
There's no boat for a month. Tie
an outboard motor on me and aim me.

1285
01:29:04,706 --> 01:29:07,504
Wait 'til I tell you.
I didn't get the tickets.

1286
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:10,669
You didn't get the tickets?
No, I ran into a fella...

1287
01:29:10,745 --> 01:29:14,613
I don't want to hear about a fella
unless he has an anchor and a poop deck.

1288
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:17,651
You're always running into a
fella, and I want to go home!

1289
01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:21,348
What are you doing to me? What I
got is better than tickets home!

1290
01:29:21,422 --> 01:29:23,754
There's nothin' better. This is better.

1291
01:29:23,825 --> 01:29:25,918
Our dough's gone.
You bought something.

1292
01:29:25,993 --> 01:29:29,394
I'm going to take you in my
hands and walk all over you!

1293
01:29:29,464 --> 01:29:32,729
Chuck! Be a good boy. Just relax.

1294
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:35,325
The tickets!
I wanna go home!

1295
01:29:35,403 --> 01:29:38,099
Wait just a minute.

1296
01:29:38,172 --> 01:29:42,233
<i>Here's what we got and for
keeps too. Donna.! Julia.!</i>

1297
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:46,144
What is this? We wanted
to get money to get home.

1298
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:50,241
They were workin' that slave
racket. What about Bradley?

1299
01:29:50,318 --> 01:29:53,754
Love upset that. I couldn't get
Donna near him with a mule team.

1300
01:29:53,821 --> 01:29:58,451
She tossed him over, huh?
Well, it's no surprise.

1301
01:29:58,526 --> 01:30:01,495
I figured sooner or later she'd
get moody about me again...

1302
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:03,928
Wait, Livingstone.
Not you, him.

1303
01:30:03,998 --> 01:30:06,626
You know,
some fellas got it...

1304
01:30:06,701 --> 01:30:08,794
and some fellas
ain't got it.

1305
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:10,701
So that's
the way it is?

1306
01:30:10,772 --> 01:30:12,763
I got it.

1307
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,536
How are we all
gonna get home?

1308
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:18,943
<i>We've only got dough for
two tickets. I got an idea.</i>

1309
01:30:19,013 --> 01:30:21,208
What an idea!
Money to get home?

1310
01:30:21,282 --> 01:30:23,682
We'll have enough for
a Mediterranean cruise!

1311
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:26,811
Chuck, go on your honeymoon!
I'll give you everything.

1312
01:30:26,888 --> 01:30:29,516
I can see this now. A
big black box. Chuck...

1313
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:32,491
It's never been done in this territory
before. You got that look, Chuck.

1314
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:36,052
<i>Hurry, hurry, hurry, folks.
Come closer, come closer.</i>

1315
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:38,621
<i>Fearless Frazier,
king of the bucksaw,</i>

1316
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:40,860
<i>will saw this
young lady in half!</i>

1317
01:30:40,935 --> 01:30:44,166
Here we go. The lid is
placed upon the lovely lady.

1318
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:46,729
We fasten the catch.
The saw is put in place...

1319
01:30:46,808 --> 01:30:49,299
and we are
about to proceed.

1320
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:51,743
You all right, honey? Right, I hope.

1321
01:30:51,813 --> 01:30:54,407
Here we go!

1322
01:30:54,482 --> 01:30:56,575
You sure you know
how to do this?

1323
01:30:56,651 --> 01:31:00,314
If I don't, one of us
is going back half-fare.
