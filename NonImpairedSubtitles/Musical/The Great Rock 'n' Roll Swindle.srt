00:00:24,617 --> 00:00:28,549
MALCOLM MCLAREN
- THE EMBLEZZER -

2
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,479
STEVE JONES
- THE CROOK -

3
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,038
PAUL COOK
- THE TEA-MAKER -

4
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,555
SID VICIOUS
- THE GIMMICK -

5
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:41,568
JOHNNY ROTTEN
- THE COLLABORATOR -

6
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:45,384
RONNIE BIGGS
- THE EXILE -

7
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,310
My name is Malcolm McLaren,

8
00:01:06,202 --> 00:01:09,195
I have brought you many
things in my time.

9
00:01:10,115 --> 00:01:15,878
A Teddy Boy named ******
suits suits, fine tailoring, pointy shoes,

10
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:19,743
Sex clubs, bondage, whips,
chains, the whole bloody lot;

11
00:01:20,982 --> 00:01:24,938
but the most succesfull of all was
an invention of mine that they called,

12
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:26,462
The Punk Rock.

13
00:01:26,913 --> 00:01:27,849
LESSON 1.

14
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:32,894
- HOW TO MANUFACTURE YOUR GROUP? -

15
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:35,893
Find yourself four kids.

16
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,642
Make sure they hate each other.

17
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,130
Make sure they can't play.

18
00:01:43,683 --> 00:01:46,590
Ah, let me start from the begining...

19
00:01:46,794 --> 00:01:50,145
How should we know
whether the pope is a murderer?

20
00:01:58,296 --> 00:02:00,859
Fire, fire, fire!

21
00:02:11,772 --> 00:02:19,626
In our case, there was Steve Jones,
18 years of age, a brilliant cat-burglar

22
00:02:20,496 --> 00:02:24,691
In one instance, nearby at
Rolling Stones' Keith Richards' house,

23
00:02:25,684 --> 00:02:30,348
he manage to steal a colour tv,
a load of nice fur coats,

24
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:32,362
and a bunch of guitars.

25
00:02:32,697 --> 00:02:36,046
Well, I nominated him a guitarist.

26
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,900
Anarchy!

27
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,274
Ahh, there was another fella
friend of his, Paul Cook, a typical lout,

28
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:52,223
unafraid of anything criminal,
always on time.

29
00:02:52,296 --> 00:02:54,561
We had to provide the bait!

30
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:57,437
He became our drummer.

31
00:02:58,765 --> 00:02:59,800
Go away!

32
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:16,163
Do you want these prawns?

33
00:03:22,023 --> 00:03:23,788
I've a lot of burning to do tonight.

34
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:31,484
Often, lurking in the corner of the shop,
i noticed this dickensian figure

35
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:36,903
and a chance to be singer
in our group was one he had to take.

36
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:43,108
When I learned he was Irish
and Steve saw his green teeth,

37
00:03:43,354 --> 00:03:47,268
we called him Johnny Rotten!

38
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,872
Then there was Sid.

39
00:03:51,182 --> 00:03:54,240
Sidney was a natural terrorist,

40
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:59,691
who arrived too damn late, but he
kept in touch as an Agent Provocateur,

41
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:01,711
working in the clubs.

42
00:04:01,844 --> 00:04:09,640
Ensuring that every gig the group played
ended up in an unpredictable bloody mess.

43
00:04:10,546 --> 00:04:13,131
Bashing and jumping all about.

44
00:04:13,592 --> 00:04:18,383
He invented the pogo
and we gave him a nice name,

45
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,059
Sidney Vicious.

46
00:05:02,793 --> 00:05:05,056
ENEMIES OF THE WORLD

47
00:05:45,682 --> 00:05:47,299
With the lineup complete,

48
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,846
we immediately set about
putting our plan into effect.

49
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:54,748
To swindle our way to the top
of the rock n roll industry.

50
00:05:57,886 --> 00:06:00,560
It was a plan, that within 2 years,

51
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:03,404
was to bring us close on a million pounds,

52
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:09,159
and a household name as the
most filthy, disgusting, dirtiest,

53
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:11,737
rock n' roll band in the
whole bloody world.

54
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:19,003
1978 KIDS AUDITION
ANYONE CAN BE A SEX PISTOL

55
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:41,074
# People said we couldn't play #

56
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,800
# The called us foul-mothed yobs #

57
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:47,261
# But the only notes that really count #

58
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,661
# Are the ones that come in wads #

59
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:53,630
# They all drowned when the air turned blue #

60
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:56,192
# 'cos we didn't give a toss #

61
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,752
# Filthy lucre, ain't nothing new #

62
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,738
# But we all get cash from the chaos #

63
00:07:03,446 --> 00:07:06,296
# The time is right to do it now #

64
00:07:06,453 --> 00:07:09,002
# The greatest rock'n'roll swindle #

65
00:07:09,718 --> 00:07:13,726
# The time is right to do it now #

66
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,050
# E.m.i. said you're out of hand #

67
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:21,446
# And they gave us the boot #

68
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:25,364
# But they couldn't sack us, just like #

69
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,866
# That Without giving us the loot #

70
00:07:29,028 --> 00:07:31,755
# Thank you kindly A&M #

71
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,614
# They said we were out of bounds #

72
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,169
# But that ain't bad for two weeks work #

73
00:07:38,388 --> 00:07:41,612
# And 75,000 pounds #

74
00:07:41,656 --> 00:07:44,404
# The time is right to do it now #

75
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,321
# The greatest rock'n'roll swindle #

76
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:52,261
# The time is right to do it now #

77
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,303

78
00:07:57,614 --> 00:08:00,361
# The greatest rock'n'roll swindle #

79
00:08:00,935 --> 00:08:05,061
# The time is right to do it now #

80
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,193
# I just wanna play with my hand #

81
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:12,770
# Are you good enough for me #

82
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:16,398
# Hiya boys I'm the choosen one #

83
00:08:16,424 --> 00:08:19,067
# Can't you fucking see #

84
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,647
# I'm a jealous God and
I want everything #

85
00:08:22,673 --> 00:08:25,184
# And I love you with a knife #

86
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:29,195
# I'll take you, if you're ready for me #

87
00:08:29,484 --> 00:08:31,638
# And I'll give you my life #

88
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,573
# The time is right for nickey's special #

89
00:08:35,612 --> 00:08:38,039
# The greatest rock'n'roll star #

90
00:08:38,703 --> 00:08:43,159
# The time is right for me, now! #

91
00:08:43,993 --> 00:08:49,261
# I'd kill... Elvis Presley died in 1959 #

92
00:08:51,153 --> 00:08:54,054
Chuck Berry is a (?) fucker

93
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:05,982
Ian Dury cockney fraud,
Mick Jagger white nigger

94
00:09:06,053 --> 00:09:09,604
Bob Dylan with a parking
ticket stuck to his arsehole

95
00:09:09,992 --> 00:09:12,833
David Bowie is blessed curse!!!!!

96
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,462
Rod Stewart's got a luggage
label tied to his tonsils

97
00:09:27,636 --> 00:09:31,472
Elton John: hair transplant

98
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,722
Sid Vicious, a rock'n'roll cliche.

99
00:09:42,236 --> 00:09:44,184
Paul Cook, hamburguesas

100
00:09:45,317 --> 00:09:47,212
Rock 'N' Roll!

101
00:09:49,037 --> 00:09:52,402
Johnny Rotten his days are even numbered.

102
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:18,566
Hello Mama!

103
00:10:20,378 --> 00:10:21,636
Rock 'N' Roll!

104
00:10:22,566 --> 00:10:25,089
Swindle! It's a swindle!

105
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,832
Helen, come and turn this racket off!

106
00:10:53,475 --> 00:10:56,079
Haven't you understood anything yet?

107
00:10:56,418 --> 00:11:01,067
You realized these kids didn't
buy the records for the music.

108
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:04,188
That was the case this thing would
have died a death years ago.

109
00:11:05,354 --> 00:11:08,164
LESSON 2
- ESTABLISH THE NAME -

110
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:16,560
Well, to establish the name Sex Pistols
i avoided competition of all costs.

111
00:11:16,725 --> 00:11:21,608
I prevented the band from ever playing
in any of those Rock'N'Roll houses.

112
00:11:21,685 --> 00:11:27,285
Instead we play strip-tease clubs,
prisons, fashionable parties,

113
00:11:27,402 --> 00:11:31,253
didn't really matter just any shit-hole
that didnt reak of Rock'N'Roll.

114
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:36,684
I used to plant people in the audience,
get them to swear 'nd split.

115
00:11:37,986 --> 00:11:40,915
People throw a few hard throw
bottles at the bastards,

116
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,954
but i made double-ly sure that
it was always the Sex Pistols

117
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,940
that got thrown out
for causing all the trouble.

118
00:11:48,581 --> 00:11:52,324
I felt the time was right
to find a real good solid base,

119
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:54,844
smack in the heart of the record industry.

120
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:57,787
Remembering all the time never to compete

121
00:11:57,974 --> 00:12:00,458
with that necrophiliac Rock'N'Roll.

122
00:12:00,614 --> 00:12:01,903
Not yet anyway.

123
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:08,365
I walk around down into Soho,
looked in the arcades and discos,

124
00:12:08,435 --> 00:12:10,192
soliciting young kids.

125
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:12,561
Didn't want fans who like music,

126
00:12:12,837 --> 00:12:15,297
just wanted kids who loved to dress up,

127
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:16,821
mess up.

128
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:28,943
Get off your arse!

129
00:12:30,823 --> 00:12:35,761
Cultivate the curiosity
of the press and other media.

130
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,176
Minimalize the possibility
of them ever seeing the group.

131
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,708
# I am an antichrist #

132
00:12:44,084 --> 00:12:47,287
# I am an anarchist #

133
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,796
# Don't know what I want
But I know how to get it #

134
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,180
# I wanna destroy passerby #

135
00:12:54,205 --> 00:12:56,117
# 'Cause I #

136
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,189
# I wanna be #

137
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:03,596
# Anarchy #

138
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,393
# In the City. #

139
00:13:07,682 --> 00:13:11,744
# Anarchy for the UK #

140
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:15,476
# It's coming sometime and maybe #

141
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:18,954
# I give a wrong time
stop at traffic line #

142
00:13:19,196 --> 00:13:22,344
# Your future dream is
a shopping scheme #

143
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,814
# 'Cause I #

144
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:27,532
# I wanna be #

145
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:33,182
# Anarchy #

146
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:42,301
Forget about music, and concentrate
on creating generation gaps.

147
00:13:46,095 --> 00:13:51,900
Call all hippies boring old farts
and set light to them.

148
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:59,292
# How many ways to
get what you want #

149
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:02,644
# I use the best
I use the rest #

150
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:06,161
# I use the N.M.E #

151
00:14:06,474 --> 00:14:09,812
# I use Anarchy #

152
00:14:09,843 --> 00:14:11,155
# 'Cause #

153
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:15,836
# I wanna be #

154
00:14:16,181 --> 00:14:19,212
# Anarchy #

155
00:14:19,736 --> 00:14:21,971
# Get pissed! #

156
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:37,126
Terrorize, threaten and insult
your own useless generation.

157
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:41,235
# Anarchy for the UK #

158
00:14:41,611 --> 00:14:44,837
# Is this the U.D.A #

159
00:14:45,127 --> 00:14:48,401
# Is this the I.R.A #

160
00:14:48,744 --> 00:14:51,667
# I thought it was the UK #

161
00:14:51,747 --> 00:14:53,286
# Or just #

162
00:14:54,678 --> 00:15:01,252
# Another country #

163
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,659
# Council tenancy #

164
00:15:06,277 --> 00:15:10,972
# I wanna be #

165
00:15:12,301 --> 00:15:15,551
# Anarchy #

166
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,568
# Get pissed! #

167
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:25,016
# I wanna be #

168
00:15:26,244 --> 00:15:29,100
# Anarchist #

169
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,694
Suddenly, you become a noble idea.

170
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:36,630
And you've got people wanting to join in.

171
00:15:37,086 --> 00:15:42,246
You've gained credibility from nothing,
you're the talk of the town.

172
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,347
Develop this as a story you can sell.

173
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:51,624
The first time i layed eyes on Mclaren,
he was chasing me down the King's road

174
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:54,420
on account of the clothes
i'd just nicked from his shop.

175
00:15:56,034 --> 00:16:00,918
3 years later i steped off the concord
from Rio with a foul taste in my mouth.

176
00:16:03,052 --> 00:16:04,382
It was me looking for him.

177
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:07,498
The trial has lead from the
plush appartment of Ronnie Biggs.

178
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,857
Back to the rat ridden streets of Soho.

179
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:14,107
I thought we was in it together
but the swindle had become a vicious circle

180
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:15,967
and now it was reaching me.

181
00:16:20,016 --> 00:16:24,112
He ran his empire from a sleazy back room
above a strip club in Greek Street

182
00:16:24,572 --> 00:16:29,338
Malcolm always had good taste, but if he
rips me off i'll break his fucking legs.

183
00:16:40,272 --> 00:16:43,022
I tried the safe where
he always stashed his dough,

184
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:45,404
he didnt trust anyone, let alone a bank.

185
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,496
The clues were in
front of me in black and white,

186
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,138
Bollocks!

187
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:55,909
but i never learned to read or write.

188
00:17:02,764 --> 00:17:06,317
People often ask me the difference
between the sex pistols and the beatles.

189
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,710
Soap and water.

190
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:10,260
I was only a nipper
when they was going,

191
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:12,416
but i was fucking glad when they broke up.

192
00:17:15,658 --> 00:17:19,971
Hello, i've got a lesson 3 on the line,
"How to sell the swindle?".

193
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,322
Reverse charges, will you accept the call?

194
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:27,408
Helen, find yourself a lawyer
who has no interest in music.

195
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:30,542
That is purely interesting
in making money.

196
00:17:30,698 --> 00:17:34,595
He's your main asset in
developeing the highest price.

197
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:37,275
And in illustrating to record companies

198
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:40,517
the enormous potential a
band that can't play.

199
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:46,665
Now begins the task of intresting
the record companies on your own terms

200
00:17:46,907 --> 00:17:50,469
And get them to start battling
against each other for the group.

201
00:17:57,921 --> 00:17:59,381
Dave Dee, please! A&R

202
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:01,915
- A&R, Dave Dee speaking.
- This is Chris Parry.

203
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:03,653
Halo, Doug Darcy, Chrysalis records.

204
00:18:04,005 --> 00:18:05,551
What about the Sex Pistols?

205
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,628
They were a particularly ugly band.

206
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,265
It's dreadful.

207
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,458
The group were doing a very private,

208
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:11,949
I think, secret show,

209
00:18:12,018 --> 00:18:14,175
at "The Screen on the Green," lslington.

210
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:16,901
I went along with a
couple of our A&R people,

211
00:18:16,927 --> 00:18:18,754
and, eh, Chris Wright, the chairman.

212
00:18:18,971 --> 00:18:21,666
And eh, we got to the door,
knocked on the door,

213
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:23,586
somebody opened the door
and said, "Fuck off!"

214
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,022
My initial reaction when
i walked into the club, you know,

215
00:18:27,452 --> 00:18:31,405
was to make the bar which is always quite,
you know, the best thing to do.

216
00:18:31,581 --> 00:18:33,233
Well we weren't gonna be dissuaded,

217
00:18:33,264 --> 00:18:37,037
so we sort of tapped on
the door again and said: "We're invited."

218
00:18:37,114 --> 00:18:39,231
And a head popped 'round again,
and said, "Fuck Off!"

219
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:42,109
It was full of these,
you know, young kids.

220
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,848
They were obviously very
much into the band.

221
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,588
So we tried a third time,

222
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:48,684
and eventualy another head
came out the door and we said:

223
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:50,247
"Look, we really are invited along".

224
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,152
So they said:
"Okay, you come in, but stand at the back!"

225
00:18:53,238 --> 00:18:55,597
And there was a little bit
of a scuffle, nothing much.

226
00:18:55,744 --> 00:18:58,783
Generaly there was an
atmosphere of antagonism,

227
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,899
you know, of supressed violence.

228
00:19:00,923 --> 00:19:04,716
I've known musicians to defend themselves
if the thing goes onto the stage,

229
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:07,739
But I've never seen musicians
drop their instruments and sort of,

230
00:19:07,987 --> 00:19:13,208
sort of, dive in a small scrap and like
extend it, and forget about the music.

231
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:14,770
You know, and I found that a bit much.

232
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:18,127
So, I went back two or three times
after that, just to make sure that,

233
00:19:18,444 --> 00:19:21,794
um, you know, they were as bad as
I thought they were the first time.

234
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:27,767
In fact a group that can't play
is better then a group that can.

235
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:37,134
# If you could see... oh God, fuck off... #

236
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:42,756

249
00:20:27,098 --> 00:20:31,060
# Go! Johnny B. Goode #

# Ayayayayayayayayayayayagwuah #

251
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:37,902
# Oh, fuck, it's awful! #

252
00:20:37,928 --> 00:20:39,302
# 
Hate songs like that! #

253
00:20:40,184 --> 00:20:43,730
Now, you're in the most
important position of all,

254
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,450
one in which you are able to sign

255
00:20:46,476 --> 00:20:50,506
with the most prestigious
company in the world.

256
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,564
Don't commit until the last minute,
when you finaly come to sign,

257
00:20:59,603 --> 00:21:00,641
forget about the future,

258
00:21:00,688 --> 00:21:04,102
get as much money as possible,
on the dotted line.

259
00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:08,374
Then demand a big party,
get all photographers there,

260
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,279
make sure it's an
important event for them.

261
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:21,645
Be as obstructive as possible Helen,

262
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:26,309
 in order to fulfill the record
company's wildest dreams;

263
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:31,074
that they are obtaining the
bargain of the century.

264
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:37,288
Malcolm McLaren
- CASH FROM CHAOS -

265
00:21:51,855 --> 00:21:54,987
The english autumn was
closing in, and so was I.

266
00:21:55,842 --> 00:21:57,444
I was calling on the cunt.

267
00:22:15,444 --> 00:22:18,765
His rambling gothic hideaway on
the slopes of Highgate cemetery,

268
00:22:18,891 --> 00:22:20,533
overlooked the tomb of Karl Marx,

269
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:22,877
and the bedroom of Lyndsey de Paul.

270
00:22:23,428 --> 00:22:26,975
I had to give it to him,
his taste was improving.

271
00:22:33,748 --> 00:22:34,818
Ahoy Malcolm?

272
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,946
There was some old
tart at the Joanna.

273
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,322
Nice, very nice!

274
00:23:28,377 --> 00:23:29,846
Who the fuck are you?

275
00:23:29,932 --> 00:23:32,017
My name is Dona De Brett.

276
00:23:32,325 --> 00:23:35,279
And i gave a few lessons
to Johnny Rotten,

277
00:23:35,305 --> 00:23:39,516
years ago before the
group in fact began.

278
00:23:39,988 --> 00:23:44,114
Malcolm Mclaren sent
him up to me, and um,

279
00:23:44,444 --> 00:23:48,703
with the very worthy idea of teaching
him a little about voice production.

280
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:52,978
I'd say to him, "You start
one of your songs",

281
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:56,302
i don't recognise any of these
they're all since um, since my day.

282
00:23:56,506 --> 00:24:03,323
But suposing, just suposing,
that he took, um, Submission.

283
00:24:03,968 --> 00:24:07,718
And he decided that,
um, he would sing

284
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:14,965
Okay so he might sing that, and i'd
say 'right', now i know where we are.

285
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,904
And by the time i was ready,
he would have changed key.

286
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:23,330
No way, absolutly no way,
could we pick up a note

287
00:24:23,741 --> 00:24:28,594
Where-as, there, um, um, erstwhile,
their manager, erstwhile,

288
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,573
Malcolm Mclaren came up here.

289
00:24:30,726 --> 00:24:33,694
Beautiful ear, he should
have been a singer.

290
00:24:34,618 --> 00:24:37,446
It was time to find someone
who can read more than music.

291
00:24:37,584 --> 00:24:41,320
I was sure, those letters from the safe,
held the key to the swindle.

292
00:24:41,345 --> 00:24:43,934
LESSON 4.
- DO NOT PLAY DON'T GIVE THE GAME AWAY -

293
00:24:52,356 --> 00:25:00,102
# You need hands to hold
someone you care for #

294
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:08,554
# You need hands to show
that you're sincere #

295
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:18,338
# When you feel the nobody
wants to know you #

296
00:25:19,593 --> 00:25:27,120
# You need hands to
brush away the tears #

297
00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:36,349
# When you hold a brand new baby #

298
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:44,706
# You need tender hands to
guide them on their way #

299
00:25:47,021 --> 00:25:54,747
# You need hands to thank
the lord for living #

300
00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:02,881
# and for giving us this day. #

301
00:26:27,547 --> 00:26:30,218
CASH FROM CHAOS

302
00:26:32,737 --> 00:26:34,988
Was all going smoothly now,

303
00:26:35,014 --> 00:26:38,507
our record company were footing
the bill for a nationwide tour.

304
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:43,519
The only problem being - the Sex Pistols,
a band that couldn't play.

305
00:26:43,575 --> 00:26:46,880
I must admit i was a bit
stumped at this point

306
00:26:47,661 --> 00:26:50,575
but fortune played into our hands.

307
00:26:50,938 --> 00:26:54,078
The record company came up
with the Bill Grundy show.

308
00:26:54,343 --> 00:26:59,289
It was my task to
make absolutely sure,

309
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,868
that none of us would
ever return to normality.

310
00:27:05,405 --> 00:27:07,186
You dirty sod.

311
00:27:07,928 --> 00:27:09,358
You dirty old man.

312
00:27:09,384 --> 00:27:12,349
Keep going, go on, you've got another
five seconds, say something outrageous.

313
00:27:12,696 --> 00:27:14,318
- You dirty fucker.
- Clever boy.

314
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:16,561
- What a fucking rotter.
- Well that's it for tonight.

315
00:27:16,596 --> 00:27:17,380
CENSORED BY
THAMES TV

316
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,455
The show was live the lads were lively,

317
00:27:19,494 --> 00:27:21,369
i invited them to shock me, they did

318
00:27:21,418 --> 00:27:23,996
Some people were upset by
what those loutish lads said,

319
00:27:24,053 --> 00:27:26,381
but it did provide front
pages like these.

320
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,190
Carry on lads, swearing or performing

321
00:27:29,253 --> 00:27:30,674
Shut up, shut up!

322
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:34,919
I personaly have spoke to the,
the eh, manager of the group,

323
00:27:35,575 --> 00:27:39,145
who tells me that the Sex
Pistols will not perform

324
00:27:39,313 --> 00:27:43,352
before the councilors
unless we're prepared

325
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:45,872
to come here this evening to see
the whole of the show,

326
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:47,703
which we are not prepared to do.

327
00:27:47,953 --> 00:27:52,289
The commitee have decided
that the concert of the sex pistols,

328
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,477
they will not perform here tonight,

329
00:27:54,503 --> 00:27:56,651
but we are quite agreeable

330
00:27:56,677 --> 00:28:00,557
that the 3 other groups that have
already been booked will go on.

331
00:28:00,866 --> 00:28:03,619
You're sick on stage,
you spit at the audiance and so on.

332
00:28:03,713 --> 00:28:06,095
How can this be a good
example to children?

333
00:28:06,182 --> 00:28:07,978
Well, people are sick everywhere,

334
00:28:08,432 --> 00:28:10,433
people are sick and fed
up of this country.

335
00:28:10,511 --> 00:28:14,057
- Telling them what to do.
- But not getting paid for it?

336
00:28:14,174 --> 00:28:14,738
Pardon?

337
00:28:14,764 --> 00:28:17,378
But not getting paid for putting
on that sort of public show.

338
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,937
Well nor are we, we aint even
being allowed to play...

339
00:28:21,453 --> 00:28:22,960
Makes ya sick dun' it.

340
00:28:24,742 --> 00:28:29,727
Sorry. My personal view on punk
rock is that it's nauseating,

341
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:32,797
disgusting, degrading,
gastly, sleazy,

342
00:28:32,823 --> 00:28:35,407
prurient, voyeuristic and
generally nauseating.

343
00:28:35,426 --> 00:28:37,671
I think that just about covers
it as far as i'm concerned.

344
00:28:37,753 --> 00:28:41,645
Um, I think most of these groups would
be vastly improved by sudden death.

345
00:28:41,777 --> 00:28:46,004
The worst of the punk rock groups i
suppose currently, are the Sex Pistols.

346
00:28:46,055 --> 00:28:51,164
They are unbelievably nauseating, they
are the antithesis of human-kind.

347
00:28:51,511 --> 00:28:55,167
I would like to see somebody
dig a very very large,

348
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:58,033
exceedingly deep hole and drop
the whole bloody lot down it.

349
00:28:58,078 --> 00:29:00,336
You know, I think the whole
world will be vastly improved

350
00:29:00,362 --> 00:29:02,321
by their total and
utter non-existence.

351
00:29:02,467 --> 00:29:04,053
Huh, have mercy.

352
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,472
The press is a bleedin' riot today, init?

353
00:29:06,508 --> 00:29:08,243
- What are you trying to do about it?
- Make it work.

354
00:29:08,305 --> 00:29:11,179
You have to expect nothing,
you get nothing.

355
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:14,728
You start off in school and
they take your soul away ,

356
00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:16,331
they take your brains away.

357
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,890
You're not allowed to have an
opinion that differs from thiers.

358
00:29:19,528 --> 00:29:21,668
You've got to think what
they tell you to think.

359
00:29:22,223 --> 00:29:26,402
So when you leave school your
only future is getting married

360
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:32,098
and by the time you're about
29 you've got two kids

361
00:29:32,286 --> 00:29:34,386
you just want to commit suicide.

362
00:29:44,807 --> 00:29:47,314
# I've seen you in the mirror
when the story began #

363
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:50,346
# And I fell in love with you
I love your mortal sin #

364
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:53,144
# Your brains are locked away
but I love your company #

365
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:56,113
# I only ever leave you
when you got no money #

366
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,291
That's it.

367
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:07,961
Read that through Sophie so we
can understand what it's about.

368
00:30:09,732 --> 00:30:10,820
"Dear Sounds,

369
00:30:11,096 --> 00:30:13,791
why do you devout so much space
to the appalling Sex Pistols?

370
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:15,798
I thought we were trying
to cut out violence

371
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:17,658
at concerts, football
matches and where-ever.

372
00:30:17,969 --> 00:30:19,961
It's these sick bastards
who encourage it.

373
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,643
You just have to look
at their audience,

374
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:23,477
i doubt if they've got one
'O Level' between them."

375
00:30:23,962 --> 00:30:25,392
Yeah, that's not bad Soph.

376
00:30:26,873 --> 00:30:28,195
But we gota make fucking sure

377
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,955
that we can create enough
stink to whip up real hatred

378
00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:32,571
before that record comes out.

379
00:30:33,978 --> 00:30:35,408
Have you got a name for this one,

380
00:30:35,613 --> 00:30:38,338
i'm fed up with sending letters
to the poxy music press.

381
00:30:38,392 --> 00:30:41,267
# I got no emotions for anybody else #

382
00:30:41,448 --> 00:30:44,088
# You better understand
I'm in love with myself, #

383
00:30:44,113 --> 00:30:48,730
# Myself, my beautiful self #

384
00:30:49,832 --> 00:30:52,715
# A no feelings #

385
00:30:52,865 --> 00:30:55,379
# A no feelings #

386
00:30:55,825 --> 00:30:58,075
# A no feelings #

387
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,434
# For anybody else #

388
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:16,364
# Sleep in heavenly peace #

389
00:31:16,387 --> 00:31:20,035
We hope tonight, by this protest
to make Wales know,

390
00:31:20,189 --> 00:31:22,235
and time for people of this town know,

391
00:31:22,288 --> 00:31:25,733
that we do protest and it
is by no fault of ours,

392
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:27,826
that this thing has come to Caerphilly.

393
00:31:28,073 --> 00:31:32,519
We have done everything humanly possible
to ban this thing and to stop it.

394
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:34,291
And as we have not been able to

395
00:31:34,317 --> 00:31:37,976
we have done the last thing possible
to stand here in open protest

396
00:31:38,006 --> 00:31:41,560
to let you now that we are responsible

397
00:31:41,584 --> 00:31:45,466
and we are doing all we can
to set an example in leadership

398
00:31:45,505 --> 00:31:50,338
and in every other way for free living,
home-ly living and pure living.

399
00:31:50,447 --> 00:31:52,301
The thing is they're
outside, freezing.

400
00:31:52,405 --> 00:31:53,433
We're in here, we're all right.

401
00:31:54,336 --> 00:31:58,470
Caerphilly didn't quite what
to expect so took no chances.

402
00:32:01,018 --> 00:32:04,308
Pubs and cafes were closed
before and after the concert.

403
00:32:05,782 --> 00:32:08,504
On decible points the
Sex Pistols won,

404
00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:11,353
on numbers it was a victory
for the carol singers.

405
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,392
Excuse me Sir, can i ask you
why you're here tonight?

406
00:32:13,513 --> 00:32:17,380
Because i'm, um,
recognise as a christian.

407
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:21,250
Nevermind about christianity,
i think it's, well, degrading

408
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:24,629
and disgusting for our children
to hear and see such things.

409
00:32:25,363 --> 00:32:28,613
Eh, I got teenage daughters,
and, eh, youngsters,

410
00:32:28,794 --> 00:32:29,879
they went and went to Rod Stewart

411
00:32:29,905 --> 00:32:31,883
 but i wouldnt let them
go to see this rubbish.

412
00:32:31,925 --> 00:32:34,797
If i thought one of mine was in there,
i'd go in there and drag them out.

413
00:32:35,506 --> 00:32:37,574
Terrible I think it is, i
think it's disgusting.

414
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,101
It's, well, it's lowering the
standard of our people in Caerphilly.

415
00:32:55,804 --> 00:32:58,657
# What you see, you can get #

416
00:32:59,056 --> 00:33:01,853
# Nothing's free, nothing's said #

417
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,228
# Don't be fooled by the signs #

418
00:33:05,548 --> 00:33:08,392
# Don't read in between the lines #

419
00:33:08,743 --> 00:33:11,080
# What you're gonna say #

420
00:33:11,665 --> 00:33:14,455
# What you're gonna do #

421
00:33:15,087 --> 00:33:18,087
# Now you've missed out once again #

422
00:33:18,548 --> 00:33:22,627
# But I thought you knew #

423
00:33:22,756 --> 00:33:25,330
# Oh you silly thing #

424
00:33:26,095 --> 00:33:28,619
# You've really gone and done it now #

425
00:33:29,446 --> 00:33:32,667
# Oh you silly thing #

426
00:33:35,656 --> 00:33:36,805
300%
PROOF

427
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,714
AIRPORT

428
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,140
PISTOLS SACKED

429
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,940
JUST SUCKED

430
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:14,793
I should have known,
it was a Rock 'N' Roll swindle all along.

431
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:19,170
Mclaren had spent a fucking
long time with these record hippys.

432
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:23,965
It can't all have been breaking
whiskey bottles over their bleedin' desks.

433
00:35:24,363 --> 00:35:26,277
The deals were too good to be true.

434
00:35:26,861 --> 00:35:30,048
I was sure ??Noel was there??,
the freckled face cunt.

435
00:35:32,394 --> 00:35:35,839
The Sex Pistols - a walking abortion.

436
00:35:37,275 --> 00:35:42,837
The Sex Pistols are nothing but a
bunch of irresponsible, half-dead lumps.

437
00:35:44,044 --> 00:35:45,799
But the best are born.

438
00:35:45,955 --> 00:35:48,303
I was only in it for the
birds after the show.

439
00:35:51,337 --> 00:35:57,165
You, Steve Jones, are nothing but
a walking dildo doing a good plumbing job.

440
00:35:57,334 --> 00:36:02,697
You'd swim through a river of snot,
wade nostril deep through a mile of vomit,

441
00:36:02,767 --> 00:36:05,931
as long as you thought there
was a sexy cunt at the end of it

442
00:36:06,891 --> 00:36:09,102
and those cunts!

443
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:14,211
Daddy's girl!

444
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,278
Daddy's girls are in awe
of the Sex Pistols!

445
00:36:18,597 --> 00:36:22,478
They really believe that what
they're grooving on bores them to shit!

446
00:36:22,733 --> 00:36:26,264
Daddy's girls are just hot
water bottles with tits.

447
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:31,408
Why are they so fucking
successful, the Sex Pistols?

448
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:37,980
And the Sex Pistols like death,
it excites them sexually.

449
00:36:38,652 --> 00:36:41,090
In the end, you see, it all
comes down to one thing:

450
00:36:41,555 --> 00:36:45,282
they have a sort of
negative Midas touch.

451
00:36:45,721 --> 00:36:48,971
Everything they touch
turns to shit!

452
00:36:50,483 --> 00:36:54,358
I gota hand it to Malcolm,
he certanly brought the punk out in me.

453
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:08,441
- Hi.
- Evening Malcolm.

454
00:37:08,466 --> 00:37:11,075
I hope theres no guest list tonight,
no record executives,

455
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:12,827
remember, I don't
want any journalists,

456
00:37:12,962 --> 00:37:15,365
none of those bloody
vampires, just the kids.

457
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:16,428
You'll be away Malcolm.

458
00:37:16,574 --> 00:37:18,433
Good enough, I'm gona
pop in and have a beer.

459
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:19,987
They're jumping live
in there tonight.

460
00:37:21,443 --> 00:37:22,763
-Hi
-Alright!

461
00:37:25,015 --> 00:37:27,077
Punkrockers, lesson 5.

462
00:37:27,093 --> 00:37:29,710
How to steal as much money
as quickly as possible

463
00:37:29,733 --> 00:37:32,397
from the record company of
you choice, you dig it?

464
00:37:32,648 --> 00:37:35,000
And here they are, 'Black Arabs'.

465
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:50,807
It was inevitable; disco.

466
00:38:51,337 --> 00:38:52,977
Malcolm always was a hustler,

467
00:38:53,002 --> 00:38:55,884
he bought out a taty jet set
dive in ol' Bond Street,

468
00:38:56,025 --> 00:38:58,705
makin' ends meet in the disco heat.

469
00:39:00,097 --> 00:39:02,230
- Membership only tonight.
- I'm on the guest list.

470
00:39:02,254 --> 00:39:04,699
- There's no guest list tonight.
- I wana see Malcolm.

471
00:39:04,738 --> 00:39:07,245
- Malcolm who?
- Malcolm McLaren, you know who i mean.

472
00:39:08,831 --> 00:39:10,534
- What's your name?
- Jones.

473
00:39:10,832 --> 00:39:12,214
- Jones what?
- Steve.

474
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,427
- Ask Nolan if he knows Steve Jones?

475
00:39:14,464 --> 00:39:16,341
Steve Jones? You want
me to go right now?

476
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:17,043
Right now!

477
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,043
You hand on there.

478
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:29,417
- Hi
- In ya go son, straight away.

479
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,738
Right thereon the left.

480
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:37,904
Straight through straight on through
there, goon then, enjoy yourselves, go on.

481
00:39:38,742 --> 00:39:40,038
WHO KILLED BAMBI?

482
00:39:50,728 --> 00:39:53,634
Next step is to get off the
record label quick as possible

483
00:39:53,788 --> 00:39:56,631
give the record company any
excuse but just make sure

484
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:59,225
you ripped them off for
as much money as you can.

485
00:39:59,495 --> 00:40:03,418
Switch the groups misbehaviour in
public, bullshit the record company,

486
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,652
making them believe that
you are an anarcist.

487
00:40:10,632 --> 00:40:15,258
One week after EMI dumped the Sex
Pistols, A&M records picked them up.

488
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,828
And staged a contract signing ceremony
in front of Buckingham Palace.

489
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:23,404
At this point, the Sex Pistols,
despite having been fired,

490
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,112
were not exactly suffering.

491
00:40:25,321 --> 00:40:28,921
Before EMI could get rid of them,
it had to buy off the contract,

492
00:40:28,946 --> 00:40:32,500
and that cost the company
a reported L25.000.

493
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,658
And here they were
signing a new contract

494
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,305
that could make them
a lot of money,

495
00:40:38,368 --> 00:40:42,875
and they already had a song to record for
A&M in honour of the Queens jubilee.

496
00:40:43,922 --> 00:40:46,976
They did not record it, not
at least for A&M records.

497
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:49,288
They never recorded anything for A&M.

498
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:53,133
Acording to the story, after
this happy signing ceremony

499
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:55,822
everyone went back to A&M
offices to celebrate.

500
00:41:12,608 --> 00:41:15,383
# She was a girl from Birmingham #

501
00:41:15,408 --> 00:41:18,150
# She just had an abortion #

502
00:41:18,339 --> 00:41:21,174
# She was case of insanity #

503
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:23,933
# Her name was Pauline,
she lived in a tree #

504
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:26,918
# She was a no one who killed her baby#

505
00:41:26,981 --> 00:41:29,817
# She sent her letters
from the country #

506
00:41:29,873 --> 00:41:31,919
# She was an animal #

507
00:41:32,592 --> 00:41:35,084
# She was a bloody disgrace #

508
00:41:35,413 --> 00:41:37,568
# Body! #

509
00:41:37,959 --> 00:41:39,724
# I'm not an animal #

510
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,452
# Body! #

511
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:45,672
# I'm not an animal #

512
00:41:47,235 --> 00:41:49,914
# Dragged on a table in factory #

513
00:41:50,212 --> 00:41:52,970
# Illegitimate place to be #

514
00:41:53,173 --> 00:41:55,846
# In a packet in a lavatory #

515
00:41:55,951 --> 00:41:58,923
# Die little baby screaming #

516
00:41:58,947 --> 00:42:00,332
# Body! #

517
00:42:00,363 --> 00:42:02,964
# Screaming fucking bloody mess #

518
00:42:04,582 --> 00:42:06,379
# Not an animal #

519
00:42:07,302 --> 00:42:09,607
# It's an abortion #

520
00:42:10,725 --> 00:42:12,803
# Body! #

521
00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:14,968
#  I'm not animal #

522
00:42:16,466 --> 00:42:21,047
# Mummy! I'm not an abortion #

523
00:42:22,571 --> 00:42:25,126
# Throbbing squirm, #

524
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:29,275
# gurgling bloody mess #

525
00:42:32,565 --> 00:42:34,459
# I'm not a discharge #

526
00:42:34,733 --> 00:42:38,178
Push drugs, sex and
any other stories to the papers,

527
00:42:38,204 --> 00:42:41,777
just make sure headlines
are coming quick and fast.

528
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:48,757
You know, for my point of view, I feel
that we're like some contageous disease.

529
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:52,390
You know that, eh, is
totaly misunderstood.

530
00:42:53,514 --> 00:42:55,061
I mean, when you walk in
and out of a company,

531
00:42:55,098 --> 00:42:58,551
and the guy just gives you: "Look just
take this money and don't come back"

532
00:42:59,002 --> 00:43:01,257
What are you supposed
to think about that?

533
00:43:01,283 --> 00:43:02,108
Have you had the money?

534
00:43:02,415 --> 00:43:04,548
Yes, they gave us the
cheque last night.

535
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:08,203
And you couldn't - you didn't don't
believe it was on, you couldnt..?

536
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:10,076
It just shows the hypocrisy,

537
00:43:10,197 --> 00:43:12,343
makes it very clear where
their heads are at.

538
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:15,029
- Nowhere
- I was asking Malcolm earlier..

539
00:43:15,054 --> 00:43:20,014
To give away that much money
for nothing, classic stupidity

540
00:43:20,112 --> 00:43:21,135
Ok, leave it to me.

541
00:43:22,393 --> 00:43:23,885
..he dont want of his pals, come on!

542
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,346
What do you mean,?? he's
my fucking manager.

543
00:43:25,377 --> 00:43:28,143
- That's your problem! Come on.
- Don't fuck with me!

544
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:32,377
What do you mean,??
he's my fucking manager??

545
00:43:32,492 --> 00:43:33,183
Now Get out!

546
00:43:34,548 --> 00:43:37,430
You thought you'd gotten
rid of us didn't you?

547
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,882
But you are old bean
because were back, with a vengance.

548
00:43:41,022 --> 00:43:42,966
God save the queen, my son!

549
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:45,867
LESSON 6:

550
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:50,060
- HOW TO BECOME THE WORLD'S
GREATEST TOURIST ATTRACTION? -

551
00:43:53,702 --> 00:43:57,085
Helen, never trust a hippy.

552
00:43:57,506 --> 00:44:03,803
Look for the current event,
in our case we chose the jubilee.

553
00:44:04,029 --> 00:44:06,544
And exploited it to the hilt.

554
00:44:06,967 --> 00:44:09,451
If you play your cards right...

555
00:44:09,528 --> 00:44:11,809
There's the tosspot mouthin'
off again, up there.

556
00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:17,409
You can capture the imagination
of the entire world.

557
00:44:29,053 --> 00:44:31,084
Ever get the feeling
you're being trapped?

558
00:44:32,427 --> 00:44:38,467
Banned on the land, we decided to play
our tribute to the Queen, from the river.

559
00:44:38,706 --> 00:44:44,084
Between the hours of 6 and 8 pm
the Sex Pistols play their songs.

560
00:44:44,109 --> 00:44:46,905
Beneath the bridges of London!

561
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:09,876
# God save the queen #

562
00:45:10,995 --> 00:45:13,116
# The fascist regime #

563
00:45:14,234 --> 00:45:16,719
# They made you a moron #

564
00:45:17,665 --> 00:45:19,494
# Potential H-bomb #

565
00:45:20,868 --> 00:45:22,815
# God save the queen #

566
00:45:23,809 --> 00:45:25,738
# She ain't no human being #

567
00:45:27,075 --> 00:45:29,543
# There is no future #

568
00:45:30,426 --> 00:45:33,215
# In England's dreaming #

569
00:45:33,575 --> 00:45:39,746
# Don't be told what you want
Don't be told what you need #

570
00:45:39,943 --> 00:45:43,052
# There's no future, no future, #

571
00:45:43,264 --> 00:45:45,834
# No future for you #

572
00:45:46,562 --> 00:45:48,288
# God save the queen #

573
00:45:49,474 --> 00:45:51,841
# We mean it man #

574
00:45:52,638 --> 00:45:54,810
# We love our queen #

575
00:45:55,694 --> 00:45:58,279
# God saves #

576
00:45:59,397 --> 00:46:01,397
# God save the queen #

577
00:46:02,382 --> 00:46:05,006
# 'Cause tourists are money #

578
00:46:05,851 --> 00:46:08,000
# And our figurehead #

579
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:11,571
# Is not what she seems #

580
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:14,627
# Oh God save history #

581
00:46:15,456 --> 00:46:17,777
# God save your mad parade #

582
00:46:18,683 --> 00:46:21,729
# Oh Lord God have mercy #

583
00:46:22,066 --> 00:46:24,769
# All crimes are paid #

584
00:46:25,161 --> 00:46:28,161
# When there's no future
How can there be sin #

585
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,482
# We're the flowers in the dustbin #

586
00:46:31,615 --> 00:46:34,513
# We're the poison in your human machine #

587
00:46:34,889 --> 00:46:38,146
# We're the future, your future #

588
00:46:38,178 --> 00:46:40,178
# God save the queen #

589
00:46:41,116 --> 00:46:43,452
# We mean it man #

590
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,999
# We love our queen #

591
00:46:47,577 --> 00:46:51,022
# God saves #

592
00:47:01,434 --> 00:47:04,062
They arrested Malcolm!

593
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:07,961
# God save the queen #

594
00:47:09,071 --> 00:47:11,423
# We mean it man #

595
00:47:12,321 --> 00:47:14,854
# And there is no future #

596
00:47:15,277 --> 00:47:18,316
# In England's dreaming #

597
00:47:19,184 --> 00:47:22,278
# No future, #

598
00:47:22,303 --> 00:47:25,537
# No future, #

599
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:31,015
# No future for you #

600
00:47:32,124 --> 00:47:35,290
# No future, #

601
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,611
# No future, #

602
00:47:38,752 --> 00:47:44,259
# No future for me #

603
00:47:45,259 --> 00:47:48,221
# No future, #

604
00:47:48,455 --> 00:47:51,674
# No future, #

605
00:47:51,925 --> 00:47:56,370
# No future for you #

606
00:47:56,597 --> 00:48:04,491
# No future, no future,
No future for me! #

607
00:48:06,274 --> 00:48:07,839

Two: Eagles - Hotel California

614
00:48:23,983 --> 00:48:25,608
The Sex Pistols' current record,

615
00:48:25,634 --> 00:48:28,868
 'God Save The Queen' is at number 1
at the capital hitline today,

616
00:48:28,937 --> 00:48:31,890
but the I.B.A. which administers
The Broadcasting Act,

617
00:48:31,916 --> 00:48:34,739
has advised us that
particularly at this time,

618
00:48:34,765 --> 00:48:37,920
this record is likely to cause offense
to a number of our listeners,

619
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:41,144
and have asked us not to play
it in our normal programming.

620
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:44,698
However, we will be playing this
record, with the authorities approval,

621
00:48:44,724 --> 00:48:47,801
at 7:30pm tonight on
??Brian Wills open line??

622
00:48:47,941 --> 00:48:52,558
And will welcome your views about the Punk
Rock phenomena, which this is part of.

# There's no point in asking,
you'll get no reply #

624
00:49:28,036 --> 00:49:31,207
# Oh just remember I don't decide #

625
00:49:31,255 --> 00:49:34,575
# I got no reason it's all too much #

626

# Don't ask us to attend
'cos we're not all there #

633
00:49:59,137 --> 00:50:02,465
# Oh don't pretend 'cos I don't care #

634
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:05,857

654
00:51:22,365 --> 00:51:30,228
# But now and we don't care #

655
00:51:32,065 --> 00:51:33,854
# We're pretty #

656
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:37,277
# A pretty vacant #

657
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,825
# We're pretty #

658
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:44,115

00:51:45,733 --> 00:51:47,382
# We're pretty #

660
00:51:48,259 --> 00:51:51,117
# A pretty vacant #

661
00:51:52,407 --> 00:51:54,524
# We're pretty #

662
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:57,386
# A pretty vacant #

663
00:51:57,417 --> 00:52:02,198
# And we don't care #

664
00:52:06,062 --> 00:52:10,218
It was amazing,
you couldn't see this group play,

665
00:52:10,908 --> 00:52:12,954
you couldn't hear them on the radio.

666
00:52:14,056 --> 00:52:16,923
If you wanted to buy the
record it was impossible.

667
00:52:17,016 --> 00:52:22,078
But yet this group had become
the world greatest tourist atraction.

668
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:27,623
And was fast become
Englands public enemy number 1.

669
00:52:28,524 --> 00:52:31,438
Instantly recognized
wherever they went.

670
00:52:32,293 --> 00:52:35,340
Literally prevented from
walking the streets.

671
00:52:36,493 --> 00:52:41,701
I Remember ol' Johnny,
got cut up real bad, jumped by thugs.

672
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,529
God Save the Queen, eh, John?

673
00:53:16,179 --> 00:53:21,968
Noel C??, when he came back home
with his head all covered in blood.

674
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:29,286
I knew then that i'd really cracked it
boy who was marvelous really.

675
00:53:36,308 --> 00:53:37,089
# Look at that #

676
00:53:37,769 --> 00:53:38,917
# Here she comes #

677
00:53:40,261 --> 00:53:42,839
# Here comes that girl again #

678
00:53:43,394 --> 00:53:46,073
# One of the cutest since
I don't know when #

679
00:53:46,183 --> 00:53:49,292
# But she don't notice me when I pass #

680
00:53:49,386 --> 00:53:52,581
# She goes with all the
guys from outta my class #

681
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:56,050
# But that can't stop me
from thinkin' to myself #

682
00:53:56,245 --> 00:53:58,917
# She's sure fine lookin', man,
she's something else #

683
00:54:05,191 --> 00:54:06,070
# Look at that #

684
00:54:06,071 --> 00:54:07,804
# 'Cross the street #

685
00:54:07,805 --> 00:54:12,013
# There's a car built just for me #

686
00:54:12,014 --> 00:54:15,132
# To own a car would be a luxury #

687
00:54:15,133 --> 00:54:18,308
# But right now I can't afford the gas #

688
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:21,557
# A brand new convertible
is out of my class #

689
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:24,805
# But that can't stop me
from thinkin' to myself #

690
00:54:24,806 --> 00:54:27,900
# That car's fine lookin', man,
it's something else #

691
00:54:34,316 --> 00:54:34,966
# Hey, look at that #

692
00:54:34,967 --> 00:54:36,562
# Just wait and see #

693
00:54:36,563 --> 00:54:40,818
# Worked hard and saved my dough #

694
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,971
# I buy that car and then
I roll up with Joe #

695
00:54:43,972 --> 00:54:47,156
# Get me that girl and
we go ridin' around #

696
00:54:47,157 --> 00:54:50,395
# We look real sharp
with the wide top down #

697
00:54:50,396 --> 00:54:53,651
# I keep on dreamin' and
thinkin' to myself #

698
00:54:53,652 --> 00:54:56,683
# When it all comes true, man,
that's something else #

699
00:55:02,959 --> 00:55:03,799
# Hey, look at that #

700
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,392
# What's all this? #

701
00:55:05,393 --> 00:55:09,744
# Never thought I'd do this before #

702
00:55:09,745 --> 00:55:12,848
# But here I'm a-knockin' on her door #

703
00:55:12,849 --> 00:55:16,009
# My car's out front and it's all mine #

704
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:19,216
# It's a '41 job not a '59 #

705
00:55:19,217 --> 00:55:22,568
# I got that girl and I'm
thinkin' to myself #

706
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:25,529
# She's sure fine lookin', man,
she's something else #

707
00:55:40,851 --> 00:55:41,997
It made sense,

708
00:55:42,185 --> 00:55:45,523
McLaren had never stoped talking about
that record convention in Hove.

709
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,696
They'll have more whip
rounds than a pub crawl

710
00:55:49,165 --> 00:55:51,665
And he's clean up with his
fashionable rubber gear.

711
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:57,779
Now i find myself in a respectable
backstreet off King's Cross Station,

712
00:55:57,982 --> 00:56:00,774
Looking for the Cambridge Rapist Hotel.

713
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:05,005
Client number 1 was Mamie
Records boss, Ed Berg.

714
00:56:05,411 --> 00:56:07,942
Awaiting trial on a child molesting charge.

715
00:56:08,293 --> 00:56:11,230
I'd love to see him nailed,
but i'd a funny feeling

716
00:56:11,253 --> 00:56:13,745
that either way he'd always get off.

717
00:56:14,596 --> 00:56:16,331
I promised to sign
a band a week.

718
00:56:17,284 --> 00:56:18,918
And that's excatly
what i'm gonna do.

719
00:56:18,946 --> 00:56:21,680
Never mind the signing Mr Berg,
where's Malcolm Mclaren then?

720
00:56:22,093 --> 00:56:23,119
Mclaren?

721
00:56:23,657 --> 00:56:25,334
He's never gonna work again.

722
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:27,843
The Sex Pistols are finished, over!

723
00:56:27,866 --> 00:56:29,678
Yeah, they's filthy
rich though aint they?

724
00:56:31,924 --> 00:56:34,356
We don't take risks in
this bussiness anymore.

725
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:35,761
We don't need to.

726
00:56:35,908 --> 00:56:37,681
You dirty old man.

727
00:56:39,241 --> 00:56:41,576
You were lucky last year,
when we swallowed it.

728
00:56:41,709 --> 00:56:45,334
I remember sitting at home with me
wife and kids thinking it over.

729
00:56:45,615 --> 00:56:47,412
What a fucking rotter.

730
00:56:47,607 --> 00:56:49,670
Anarchy dropped out
of the top 20.

731
00:56:49,696 --> 00:56:51,038
It was dead.

732
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:53,559
Yeah, but where were you
last night, Mr. Berg?

733
00:56:53,614 --> 00:56:56,309
Did you bum it up with that new
group you got, the Black Arabs?

734
00:56:56,918 --> 00:56:59,878
Rock n roll can mean
anything we want it to mean.

735
00:57:00,636 --> 00:57:06,190
Peace and love, bringing people
together, it can get rid of politics,

736
00:57:06,229 --> 00:57:11,955
it can be art, it's automatic,
it's just the beat.

737
00:57:12,686 --> 00:57:18,705
Big money, the normal promotion
of records isn't fun.

738
00:57:21,076 --> 00:57:22,427
Hello Judy.

739
00:57:23,091 --> 00:57:26,653
I was getting no where fast,
a chamber maid crossed my path.

740
00:57:26,754 --> 00:57:30,730
I took it out on her, i don't know
why, she couldn't talk if she tried.

741
00:57:47,442 --> 00:57:49,966
Where is Malcolm? He owns the gaff dun he?

742
00:57:55,075 --> 00:57:58,660
Every room was a dead end,
i needed to relax.

743
00:58:06,133 --> 00:58:12,617
# I'm left in misery,
the girl I love's gone across the sea #

744
00:58:12,999 --> 00:58:19,338
# I'm all alone,
I ain't got no home #

745
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:26,190
# Mandy was her name,
sleepin' was her game #

746
00:58:27,016 --> 00:58:33,761
# She didn't care about me,
oh, God, baby can't you see #

747
00:58:34,255 --> 00:58:40,731
# I'm a lonely boy. I'm a lonely boy. #

748
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:47,653
# I'm a lonely boy. I'm a lonely boy. #

749
00:58:48,492 --> 00:58:54,772
# I need her tender touch,
oh, I need it oh so much. #

750
00:58:59,019 --> 00:59:05,577
# I'm a lonely boy. I'm a lonely boy. #

751
00:59:06,097 --> 00:59:13,065
# I'm a lonely boy. I'm a lonely boy. #

752
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:21,279
# Oh my darlin' can't you see
you're the one that means so much to me. #

753
00:59:21,812 --> 00:59:28,496
# I know I need you're tender touch,
oh, I need it oh so much.  #

754
00:59:28,875 --> 00:59:30,290
***********************************************

755
00:59:35,566 --> 00:59:38,269
By the way Steve,
if you're looking for Malcolm,

756
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:41,214
he'll be on the 6.15
out of Marylebone station.

757
00:59:48,076 --> 00:59:51,858
- Sydney, this is the receiver speaking.
- Okay, ready to rock!

758
01:00:02,176 --> 01:00:02,942
Thanks a lot.

759
01:00:05,081 --> 01:00:09,015
# Well c'mon everybody
and let's get together tonight #

760
01:00:09,887 --> 01:00:12,980
Cor blimey, Jesus Christ
Helen what platform is it?

761
01:00:13,019 --> 01:00:13,886
Platform three.

762
01:00:18,422 --> 01:00:22,184
# But I'm gonna dance with three or four #

763
01:00:23,782 --> 01:00:27,627
# And the house will be shakin' from the
bare feet A-stampin' on the floor #

764
01:00:27,669 --> 01:00:29,531
I'll see ya in a few minutes,
i've just gotta do something.

765
01:00:30,109 --> 01:00:34,249
# Well, we're really gonna party
But we gotta leave a guard outside #

766
01:00:44,629 --> 01:00:47,456
OUT OF ORDER
(VANDALISM)

767
01:00:48,008 --> 01:00:49,107
LESSON 7

768
01:00:49,628 --> 01:00:53,450
- CULTIVATE HATRED,
IT IS YOUR GRATEST ASSET -

769
01:00:54,328 --> 01:00:56,725
Force the public to hate you.

770
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:01,693
Here at home, create a tour
that no one can turn up to.

771
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:07,067
Throw the groups name away, and
leave a question mark in its place.

772
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:09,572
Create confusion.

773
01:01:10,352 --> 01:01:16,198
The Sex Pistols made sure that they
failed to turn up at certain venues.

774
01:01:16,434 --> 01:01:19,220
Spreading false rumours
wherever they could.

775
01:01:19,221 --> 01:01:21,608
# Ooh! C'mon everybody #

776
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:26,577
You know, we encouraged all those kids
to travel all over the country

777
01:01:26,632 --> 01:01:30,046
without em never having the slightest
chance of seeing the band play.

778
01:01:30,046 --> 01:01:31,142
# Who cares? #

779
01:01:31,223 --> 01:01:33,537
But above all we prevented the press

780
01:01:33,563 --> 01:01:36,552
from determining whether the
band could actualy play.

781
01:01:39,741 --> 01:01:42,804
And from questioning their
now growing stature.

782
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:49,854
Well Helen, remember:
We were now a legend.

783
01:01:58,534 --> 01:02:02,575
# Well c'mon everybody
and let's get together tonight #

784
01:02:04,195 --> 01:02:05,854
# I got some money in my jeans #

785
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:08,276
# And I'm really gonna spend it right #

786
01:02:09,324 --> 01:02:12,934
# Well I've been doin' my
homework all week long #

787
01:02:13,017 --> 01:02:15,794
# Now to have some fifty
and my folk are gone #

788
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:18,716
# Ooh! C'mon everybody #

789
01:02:28,904 --> 01:02:31,138
- Isn't that Bill Jacobs?
- No.

790
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:37,773
LESSON 8

791
01:02:37,774 --> 01:02:40,774
HOW TO DIVERSITY YOUR BUSINESS...
WHAT A BUSINESS.

792
01:02:55,508 --> 01:02:59,226
I got an important gig tonight,
i want to be alone.

793
01:03:37,056 --> 01:03:40,118
Momy, Momy, come quick
someones killed Bambi!

794
01:04:06,761 --> 01:04:07,860
Step on it, Byron.

795
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:10,242
We got a plane to catch
at Hindley airport.

796
01:04:18,762 --> 01:04:21,145
Why remain just a Rock N Roll star?

797
01:04:22,042 --> 01:04:23,432
Malcolm! Open up!

798
01:04:23,604 --> 01:04:25,948
You don't just have a
group that can't play.

799
01:04:27,449 --> 01:04:29,957
You also have four actors that cant act.

800
01:04:30,746 --> 01:04:32,184
What do you mean i cant act?

801
01:04:32,826 --> 01:04:37,076
Don't think in tens, think in hundreds
and thousends of pounds.

802
01:04:37,162 --> 01:04:38,427
Come out of your closet.

803
01:04:38,505 --> 01:04:43,403
We opened officed and bank accounts
overseas, now worldwide organizations,

804
01:04:43,548 --> 01:04:47,007
it was difficult to avoid the
temptation of working with criminals

805
01:04:47,033 --> 01:04:48,359
enganged in embezzling

806
01:04:48,402 --> 01:04:52,300
huge sums of money from
international corporations.

807
01:04:52,339 --> 01:04:56,706
But i much say their expertise really
took our film investers for a ride.

808
01:04:56,759 --> 01:05:00,314
So simple, collecting thousands
of pounds of cash each week

809
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:03,532
from our record company
on the basis of a script

810
01:05:03,558 --> 01:05:07,014
that was so disgusting it just
couldn't possibly be made.

811
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:08,305
Who killed bambi?

812
01:05:08,378 --> 01:05:12,763
I kept my mouth shut, collected L250,000.

813
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:18,590
Having got a fortune for doing nothing,
the final problem was how to enjoy it.

814
01:05:18,668 --> 01:05:21,809
And get out of this stupid
rock n roll circus.

815
01:05:22,238 --> 01:05:25,215
Eventualy, we signed to the Americans.

816
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,615
For more money,

817
01:05:29,192 --> 01:05:31,895
than all the other record
companies put together.

818
01:05:33,044 --> 01:05:36,395
These bloody barbarians
who invented rock n roll

819
01:05:37,464 --> 01:05:42,104
were naturally curious about what
the Sex Pistols were all about

820
01:05:42,588 --> 01:05:46,714
and wanted their image exposed
accross the whole united states.

821
01:05:47,554 --> 01:05:49,114
Initially i admit i didnt want to go,

822
01:05:49,167 --> 01:05:52,634
we were sloppy and abusive in our
applications at the embassy ensuring

823
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:54,488
that the Visas would be refused,

824
01:05:54,495 --> 01:05:58,237
Bob Carter was in poland and those damn
hippies were demanding freedom of speech.

825
01:05:58,268 --> 01:05:59,810
Nobody better than us anyway.

826
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:03,643
Except for The Eagles, The
Eagles are better than us.

827
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:07,410
The idea was to get lost in
the swamps and the badlands,

828
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:10,458
making it impossible for
the legend to be unmasked.

829
01:06:10,621 --> 01:06:14,214
Life is so intensely profound you
know like the Sex Pistols are

830
01:06:14,253 --> 01:06:17,315
they just, their lyrics and
everything about them is so deep

831
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:18,925
you can just really get into them.

832
01:06:19,027 --> 01:06:20,792
One, two, three, four!

833
01:06:27,504 --> 01:06:32,988
Cheap holiday in other
people's misery.

834
01:06:49,234 --> 01:06:51,894
# I don't wanna holiday in the sun #

835
01:06:51,895 --> 01:06:54,872
# I wanna go to new Belsen #

836
01:06:54,873 --> 01:06:57,846
# I wanna see some history #

837
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,882
# 'Cause now I got a reasonable economy #

838
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:04,023
# Now I got a reason, now I got a reason #

839
01:07:04,024 --> 01:07:07,208
# Now I got a reason and I'm still waiting #

840
01:07:07,209 --> 01:07:08,636
# Now I got a reason #

841
01:07:08,637 --> 01:07:11,972
# Now I got reason to be waiting #

842
01:07:11,973 --> 01:07:14,006
# The Berlin Wall #

843
01:07:14,108 --> 01:07:16,116
If this is what the
american youth look up to,

844
01:07:16,142 --> 01:07:17,695
if this is what they believe in,

845
01:07:17,724 --> 01:07:20,224
then we are in sad shape.

846
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:40,143
# So bad #

847
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:41,534
# Be a man #

848
01:07:41,535 --> 01:07:43,269
# Join the army #

849
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:44,564
# Kill someone #

850
01:07:44,565 --> 01:07:46,181
# Kill yourself #

851
01:07:46,182 --> 01:07:47,812
# Kill someone #

852
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:49,468
# Join the army #

853
01:07:49,469 --> 01:07:51,028
# Kill yourself #

854
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:52,102
# Be a man. #

855
01:07:52,103 --> 01:07:53,735
# A real man. #

856
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,280
***************************************************************

857
01:07:55,281 --> 01:07:57,110
# A Hero. #

858
01:07:58,235 --> 01:07:59,204
Faggots!

859
01:08:00,015 --> 01:08:03,281
- Leave him alone you bastards!

860
01:08:04,039 --> 01:08:04,954
Leave him alone!

861
01:08:08,465 --> 01:08:10,847
As far as i'm concerned,
they're not worth killing.

862
01:08:14,397 --> 01:08:18,256
I just came up and upset the bass player
because i knew that he knew

863
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:21,826
that i meant physical harm.
And i have to say that I was ugly about it.

864
01:08:21,898 --> 01:08:24,687
But he came out and hit us
over the head with a bass.

865
01:08:24,688 --> 01:08:28,200
# It's not funny, there's no fun #

866
01:08:28,201 --> 01:08:32,456
# Head being alone, no fun! #

867
01:08:32,457 --> 01:08:36,246
# Noooo Fuuuuun! #

868
01:08:36,247 --> 01:08:39,177
# No Fuuuun! #

869
01:08:39,178 --> 01:08:42,082
# No Fuuuuuuuuuuun! #

870
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:44,974
# No Fuun! No Fuuun! #

871
01:09:25,726 --> 01:09:27,343
Our cover was blown.

872
01:09:27,945 --> 01:09:31,532
For the first time our publicity
had worked against us.

873
01:09:32,484 --> 01:09:37,109
We had become the most important name
after the president of the United States.

874
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:43,547
And that night, in Winterland,
in San Francisco.

875
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:46,884
The Sex Pistols played to the whole world.

876
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:50,839
It wasn't a rock n roll party.

877
01:09:51,696 --> 01:09:55,058
Was more like a dying horse that
needed putting out of its misery.

878
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:59,492
We raised that horses head and
choked the living daylights out of it.

879
01:10:33,548 --> 01:10:35,931
Ever get the feeling
you're been cheated?

880
01:10:37,707 --> 01:10:39,637
Jesus, Byron! Is this it?

881
01:10:39,996 --> 01:10:41,173
This is it Malcolm.

882
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:43,248
Hindley airfield.

883
01:10:43,745 --> 01:10:45,291
Battle of Britain station.

884
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:01,581
- Take off in 10 minutes Malcolm.
- Alright.

885
01:11:01,697 --> 01:11:05,695
LESSON 9
WHO KILLED BAMBI?

886
01:11:11,643 --> 01:11:14,690
Oi, can you stop here please,
i want to see Malcolm fly away.

887
01:11:27,353 --> 01:11:30,235
Haven't seen you since
our second sacking.

888
01:11:32,822 --> 01:11:34,002
Good afternoon.

889
01:11:35,361 --> 01:11:37,200
Why did the Sex Pistols break up

890
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:39,151
on the brink of being a
successful rock n roll band?

891
01:11:39,193 --> 01:11:39,766
Why?

892
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:43,915
Because we seized our chance in
San Francisco to frame our singer,

893
01:11:44,054 --> 01:11:46,597
leaving him with the contracts
and us with the money.

894
01:11:46,864 --> 01:11:52,184
Johnny Rotten claims that he's been
fired from the group? Is that true?

895
01:11:52,947 --> 01:11:54,892
Yes it is, but let me first explain.

896
01:11:56,268 --> 01:11:59,088
In order to gain everything,
you have to sarcrifice something.

897
01:11:59,822 --> 01:12:03,322
In America, our record company
was working inside our camp.

898
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:07,696
Encouraging Johnny Rotten's
pretensions as some rock n roll superstar.

899
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:10,378
We let them and they
lapped it up of course.

900
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:13,320
But eventualy he started
working for the other side.

901
01:12:13,801 --> 01:12:17,385
And what do you call people
like that in your country, monsieur?

902
01:12:17,769 --> 01:12:18,980
Collaborators.

903
01:12:21,528 --> 01:12:25,528
- How much has been made out all this?
- What? Can't hear yah.

904
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:29,246
How much money has been
made out of all this?

905
01:12:29,996 --> 01:12:36,683
So far my secretary said it was L779,000.

906
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:45,017
****************************************************************

907
01:12:45,283 --> 01:12:51,983
I have no idea, and i don't give
a shit about the Americans.

908
01:12:52,248 --> 01:12:55,850
Sure, and just how
far have you gone

909
01:12:55,875 --> 01:12:57,968
in planning this whole afair?

910
01:12:59,001 --> 01:13:02,558
Ever since i was 10 years old.

911
01:13:02,871 --> 01:13:07,268
Ever since Elvis Presley
joined the army!

912
01:13:07,351 --> 01:13:11,063
In the minds of the Sex Pistols would
you say that Punk Rock is finally dead.

913
01:13:12,938 --> 01:13:16,392
Haha, that's the most laughable
question i've heard this year.

914
01:13:16,431 --> 01:13:19,869
Who killed Bambi?

915
01:13:28,797 --> 01:13:29,499
Bollocks!

916
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,767
He left the country in a light aircraft.

917
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:36,354
The film had better be good Malcolm,

918
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:39,268
or i give you a good fucking kicking
when you get back.

919
01:13:44,041 --> 01:13:47,838
# Gentle pretty thing
Who only had one spring #

920
01:13:47,877 --> 01:13:51,509
# You bravely faced the world
Ready for anything #

921
01:13:51,554 --> 01:13:55,264
# I'm happy that you lived
For your life is mine #

922
01:13:55,309 --> 01:13:58,897
# What have I except to cry
Spirit never die #

923
01:13:59,344 --> 01:14:03,234
# Birds of the air
Beasts of the earth #

924
01:14:04,947 --> 01:14:09,789
# Overjoyed at Bambi's birth
they gambolled in the glade #

925
01:14:10,896 --> 01:14:14,490
# Who killed Bambi? Who killed Bambi? #

926
01:14:14,874 --> 01:14:18,576
# Who killed Bambi? Who killed Bambi? #

927
01:14:18,773 --> 01:14:22,193
# Who killed Bambi? Who killed Bambi? #

928
01:14:22,392 --> 01:14:24,262
# Who killed Bambi? #

929
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:27,107
Excuse me!

930
01:14:27,765 --> 01:14:29,093
Hold up? humphrey?

931
01:14:29,201 --> 01:14:31,927
Why on earth are we
going to see the Sex Pistols film.

932
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:34,685
I let to see pogo dance, very good.

933
01:14:34,967 --> 01:14:35,863
We just look.

934
01:14:36,644 --> 01:14:38,393
 You my friend,
everything they want.

935
01:14:41,288 --> 01:14:44,965
# Who killed Bambi?
Who killed Bambi? #

936
01:14:45,238 --> 01:14:48,777
# Who killed Bambi?
Who killed Bambi? #

937
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:52,667
# Who killed Bambi?
Who killed Bambi? #

938
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:55,120
# Who killed Bambi? #

939
01:15:12,161 --> 01:15:18,581
# Who killed Bambi?

940
01:15:19,661 --> 01:15:23,513
# Who killed Bambi?

941
01:15:23,723 --> 01:15:27,293
# Who killed Bambi?

943
01:15:31,341 --> 01:15:33,974
# Who killed Bambi? #

944
01:15:35,974 --> 01:15:40,059
The sinking ship of rock n roll
is going to have a tough task

945
01:15:40,107 --> 01:15:44,568
recovering for the terminal body blow
dealt it by the sex pistols.

946
01:15:44,817 --> 01:15:47,455
These four, unloveable spiky tops,

947
01:15:47,541 --> 01:15:49,502
swindle their way to the top.

948
01:15:50,173 --> 01:15:54,275
They didn't care about the music.
They were purly into chaos.

949
01:15:54,579 --> 01:15:59,586
Across the globe they achieved
a notority in 19 languages.

950
01:15:59,959 --> 01:16:04,041
On fleet street they sold
more papers than the armistice.

951
01:16:04,681 --> 01:16:09,595
In the city voted young bussinessman
of the year by the investers review.

952
01:16:09,861 --> 01:16:15,432
Yes, 1977 and the four sex pistols
had never had it so good.

953
01:16:15,486 --> 01:16:20,619
All this, a number 1 album,
four hit singeles; but then.

954
01:16:21,346 --> 01:16:24,916
Sid Vicious - hospitalized.
Johnny Rotten - fired.

955
01:16:24,994 --> 01:16:27,166
Punk Rock became a new wave

956
01:16:27,345 --> 01:16:31,447
for Paul Cook and Steve Jones,
it had to be Brasil.

957
01:16:50,133 --> 01:16:54,403
Europe's more wanted man
the great train robber Ronnie Biggs!

958
01:17:00,638 --> 01:17:01,424
Jesus!

959
01:17:04,099 --> 01:17:05,678
See that, it's me!

960
01:17:12,530 --> 01:17:14,999
Gee i'd really fancy a Sex Pistol.

961
01:17:16,663 --> 01:17:17,797
Halo, who is it?

962
01:17:17,837 --> 01:17:19,680

963
01:17:20,126 --> 01:17:22,376
Ere, who is this an army ariving?

964
01:17:24,901 --> 01:17:25,689

965
01:17:26,423 --> 01:17:27,852

01:17:29,408 --> 01:17:33,347

- There you are.

967
01:17:33,463 --> 01:17:35,474
You don't look anything
like Johnny Rotten.

968
01:17:35,537 --> 01:17:36,605
Don't fucking want to!

969
01:17:37,314 --> 01:17:40,431
You know, if you didn't swear like that
you could be another Spencer Tracy.

970
01:17:40,574 --> 01:17:43,136
I supose you want to ask the famous
question, where's all the money?

971
01:17:43,252 --> 01:17:44,988
- Where is it?
- Where is it all?

972
01:17:45,175 --> 01:17:46,622
I done it down the boozer, didn't i?

973
01:17:48,494 --> 01:17:51,034
How much did you get away
with then, all together?

974
01:17:51,181 --> 01:17:52,728
Two and a half million.

975
01:17:54,885 --> 01:17:58,010
Were on our way were on our way...

976
01:17:58,724 --> 01:18:00,091
We'll soon be up with ya.

977
01:18:01,809 --> 01:18:02,715
How much have you made?

978
01:18:02,777 --> 01:18:04,324
Well weve got ***, you didnt get any

979
01:18:04,548 --> 01:18:06,430
- Crime is strickly for mugs.
- Yes.

980
01:18:06,473 --> 01:18:08,646
Get in to the pop word,
thats the thing to do.

981
01:18:09,415 --> 01:18:11,524
Don't go round nicking
bike and things like that,

982
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:12,980
get yourself a
guitar the honest way.

983
01:18:13,017 --> 01:18:14,306
Legaly, or whatever.

984
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:17,618
This one looks so fit now,
she looks like a cat burglar or something.

985
01:18:17,806 --> 01:18:21,579
- I dont believe that
- Oh no no no!

986
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:25,855
-  Nobody believe it until they see me.
- What ** the cambridge rapist.

987
01:18:39,413 --> 01:18:42,860
A Cheap holiday in
other peoples misery!

988
01:18:47,452 --> 01:18:50,748
# I don't wanna holiday in the sun #

989
01:18:50,749 --> 01:18:53,869
# I wanna go to new Belsen #

990
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:57,029
# I wanna see some history #

991
01:18:57,030 --> 01:19:00,364
# 'Cause now I got a reasonable economy #

992
01:19:00,365 --> 01:19:03,614
# Now I got a reason, now I got a reason #

993
01:19:03,615 --> 01:19:06,845
# Now I got a reason and I'm still waiting #

994
01:19:06,846 --> 01:19:08,269
# Now I got reason #

995
01:19:08,270 --> 01:19:12,012
# Now I got reason to be waiting #

996
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:14,720
# The Berlin Wall #

997
01:19:22,309 --> 01:19:24,527
Halo, Sex Pistols?

998
01:19:24,598 --> 01:19:27,207
- Yeah.
- Who is working Fuhrer now?

999
01:19:27,232 --> 01:19:28,747
I dont know, dont ask me.

1000
01:19:28,841 --> 01:19:32,739
I , Martin Bormann, wish to be this man.

1001
01:19:33,514 --> 01:19:35,248
This is diabolical.

1002
01:19:35,274 --> 01:19:37,539
Come back Jess Conrad, all is forgiven

1003
01:19:39,212 --> 01:19:41,063
Makes me look like Lawrence
Olivier, this lot.

1004
01:19:41,554 --> 01:19:43,045
Come on, Come on Mary, mari, Maria.

1005
01:19:45,351 --> 01:19:47,414
I'm not having you watching this rubbish.

1006
01:19:47,539 --> 01:19:49,578
- Just sit down.

1007
01:19:49,632 --> 01:19:52,124

1009
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:23,196
See that, i wernt just a sex pistol,

1010
01:20:25,836 --> 01:20:27,454
Come down here, i'll tell
ya what it was all about.

1011
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,380
Le importa pedir permiso !

1012
01:20:48,806 --> 01:20:50,901
- Toma una hamburguesa, yo invito.

1013
01:20:52,161 --> 01:20:53,802
How did you have so much success?

1014
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,442
We used to nick all our
gear in the beginning.

1015
01:20:55,465 --> 01:20:57,678
We didnt have, we didnt have
enough money to pay for it

1016
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:00,725
so we used to nick it off
people like David Bowie.

1017
01:21:02,097 --> 01:21:03,927
How did, how did you manage to...

1018
01:21:03,953 --> 01:21:07,012
would you like to, sort of, give me some
information exactly how you used to steal,

1019
01:21:07,232 --> 01:21:09,747
id very very interested as a professional

1020
01:21:09,772 --> 01:21:12,357
What was your first job as a crook?

1021
01:21:12,897 --> 01:21:15,311
As a crook? Woolworths.

1022
01:21:15,428 --> 01:21:16,123
Woolworths?

1023
01:21:16,209 --> 01:21:19,147
- What did you do in Woolworths?
- Pens and pencils.

1024
01:21:19,436 --> 01:21:21,647
- Pens and pencils?
- No rubbers?

1025
01:21:22,124 --> 01:21:24,398
Okay, don't use rubbers presumably?

1026
01:21:25,044 --> 01:21:26,966
How much bread did you get from EMI?

1027
01:21:28,107 --> 01:21:32,857
Bout, 55,000 publishing fee.

1028
01:21:33,153 --> 01:21:36,489
Get together and start
composing some music

1029
01:21:36,514 --> 01:21:40,506
If i wrote the words for example,
would you possibly write the music?

1030
01:21:40,899 --> 01:21:41,701
Yeah easy.

1031
01:21:54,205 --> 01:21:59,414
# God save the sex pistols

1032

# They just like wearing filthy clothes

1033
01:22:06,769 --> 01:22:12,689

For a solution we have to go up the ***

1067
01:25:01,554 --> 01:25:03,663
For Belsen was a gaser.
