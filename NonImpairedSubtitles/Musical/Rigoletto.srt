Rigoletto!                      
Now hush and pay attention,     

3
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:48,580
Or you'll miss something        
really important.               

4
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,650
Once upon a time,               
in a land far away--            

5
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,486
So far away you'd               
never know it existed--         

6
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,054
There lived                     
an Elfin prince.                

7
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:59,758
To his people,                  
he was called Rigoletto.        

8
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,392
He was a master of song,        

9
00:01:01,493 --> 00:01:04,496
And he used the art             
of music to heal his people,    

10
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:07,065
And they lived in peace         
and prosperity                  

11
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,267
Unknown to                      
the race of men.                

12
00:01:09,368 --> 00:01:13,371
And on these distant shores     
lived the Princess Gorfindel.   

13
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,039
She was lovely to behold        

14
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,576
And her voice was cherished     
by all who heard her sing.      

15
00:01:18,677 --> 00:01:21,846
She loved Rigoletto,            
and he her,                     

16
00:01:21,947 --> 00:01:25,016
But cold winds                  
blew them ill will--            

17
00:01:25,117 --> 00:01:28,986
Mortal men who came to destroy  
the Elfin kingdom               

18
00:01:29,087 --> 00:01:32,456
On the night before             
Rigoletto and Gorfindel         

19
00:01:32,557 --> 00:01:35,660
Were to be wed                  
in eternal bliss.               

20
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,929
        Yuck.                   

21
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,065
            What do you         
            mean "yuck"?        

22
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:44,169
                    Go ahead,   
                    Bonnie.     

23
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:49,273
And Rigoletto would             
not yet know happiness,         

24
00:01:49,374 --> 00:01:52,144
For he was struck               
in battle by an evil sword,     

25
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,146
Which left half                 
of his face pale,               

26
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:58,616
Deathlike                       
and hideous to behold.          

27
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,122
In his pride, Rigoletto allowed 
the ugliness of his face        

28
00:02:05,223 --> 00:02:09,694
To poison his heart,            
making it ugly as well.         

29
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:13,230
And none could heal him.        

30
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:18,102
So Rigoletto left his kingdom   
and went into the world of men, 

31
00:02:18,203 --> 00:02:20,871
Accompanied only                
by his betrothed                

32
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:23,108
And his faithful servant,       

33
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:27,011
Never to return until he found  
one from the world of men       

34
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:31,583
Of pure heart, whose love       
would break the evil spell.     

35
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:37,889
I wish I could sing             
like the Princess.              

36
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,625
Then I would win

    than other people?

They just can't express 'em     
like you and me do.

that's why not!

Wait just a minute.

Probably a banker.

    You know, it's funny getting

212
00:13:45,823 --> 00:13:48,059
            Especially during

His name's Ribaldi.

Other than that, nobody seems   
to know a thing about him,

00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,842
Except that he has access       
to large amounts of money.      

220
00:14:05,943 --> 00:14:08,980
This world has gone crazy       
when a good man like Alf

    Get out!                    

335
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:36,099
                     <i>Hans! Hans!</i>

336
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,603
        I think                 
        he wants you.           

337
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:42,238
                 <i>Hans, come</i>     
                 <i>to me now!</i>     

338
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,941
                 <i>You told me</i>    
                 <i>it would work!</i> 

339
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,209
                 <i>You told me</i>    
                 <i>what to do!</i>    

340
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,376
             <i>It didn't work!</i>    

341
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:47,711
                 <i>How long</i>       
                 <i>must I wait?</i>   

342
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:49,846
            How long must       
            I keep looking?     

343
00:20:49,947 --> 00:20:51,949
            Aaauuuuggghhhh!     

344
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,851
Patience                        
is a virtue.                    

345
00:20:54,952 --> 00:20:57,887
                Patience        
                is a virtue?    

346
00:20:57,988 --> 00:21:04,594
    Get your sniveling,         
    pasty face out of here--now!

347
00:21:04,695 --> 00:21:08,165
            I don't know.       

348
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:10,467
You told him no?                

349
00:21:10,568 --> 00:21:13,069
        Bonnie, you are not     
        working for that man.   

350
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,171
    Why not?                    

351
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:17,207
    Cuz there's something about 
    him that frightens me.      

352
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:18,809
Like what?                      

353
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,643
            It's like he's      
            hiding something--  

354
00:21:20,744 --> 00:21:22,579
            This dark secret.   

355
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,481
            He wouldn't even    
            let me see him.     

356
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:26,149
        As we talked, he just   
        kept in the shadows,    

357
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,684
            And then, when      
            he got angry,       

358
00:21:27,785 --> 00:21:30,487
            It was as if        
            he were this beast. 

359
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:34,958
So...Either                     
we're homeless...               

360
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:37,661
Or I go to work                 
for a person                    

361
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:43,166
That's more like                
a beast than a man?             

362
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:47,704
        Sweetheart,             
        this is not worth it.   

363
00:21:49,707 --> 00:21:50,774
    It's okay.                  

364
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,042
    I don't mind.               

365
00:21:52,143 --> 00:21:54,511
Could it be worse               
than being homeless?            

366
00:21:54,612 --> 00:21:55,946
                Maybe.          

367
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:58,348
Let me at least                 
try it for one day.             

368
00:21:58,449 --> 00:22:00,484
                He is different.

369
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:07,491
But, being different            
doesn't make you bad...Does it? 

370
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:11,962
        Most of the time, no.   
        But sometimes it does.  

371
00:22:13,631 --> 00:22:17,967
Well, there's only              
one way to find out.            

372
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:25,535
                Bonnie, do you  
                see this door?  

373
00:23:25,636 --> 00:23:26,102
    Yes.                        

374
00:23:26,203 --> 00:23:27,571
            This door, here.    

375
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:28,838
    I see it.                   

376
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:34,778
        You must never,         
        never enter this room.  

377
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:37,146
        Do you understand?      

378
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,150
        I can't hear you.       

379
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:40,984
I understand.                   

380
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:43,253
            Good.               
            Follow me.          

381
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,926
[ Hans: ]                       
Bonnie...                       

382
00:23:50,027 --> 00:23:54,464
             <i>What will happen</i>   
             <i>if I go in there?</i>  

383
00:23:56,401 --> 00:24:00,604
        Have you ever           
        heard the expression,   

384
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:03,440
            "curiosity          
            killed the cat?"    

385
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,642
    Yes.                        

386
00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:07,711
                Good.           

387
00:24:07,812 --> 00:24:09,412
                Now follow me.  

388
00:24:09,513 --> 00:24:13,182
So what will happen             
if I go into the room?          

389
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:24,094
            The master resides  
            in that room.       

390
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:26,596
            The master          
            desires his privacy 

391
00:24:26,697 --> 00:24:29,465
        More than anything      
        else in life.           

392
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:32,869
        Should you invade       
        that privacy,           

393
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,705
        You risk his anger.     

394
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:40,210
                His anger can   
                be terrible.    

395
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:43,647
                Do you          
                understand now? 

396
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:46,616
So what will he do?             

397
00:24:51,422 --> 00:24:53,756
        If you promise me       

398
00:24:53,857 --> 00:24:58,595
        That you will never     
        go into that room,      

399
00:24:58,696 --> 00:25:02,899
        Then I'll see to it     
        that you receive        

400
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,368
        Whatever dessert        
        you want                

401
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:07,037
Every night                     
you are here.

          Banana split?         

403
00:25:09,306 --> 00:25:10,173
Certainly.                      

404
00:25:10,274 --> 00:25:11,908
        Deal.                   

405
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:16,079
            Good.

            like animals.       

411

Them pigs is animals,           
ain't they?                     

412

            two differences

sticking out of his mouth

Often.                          
You're a special girl.          

547
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,283
But then all little             
girls are special.              

548
00:32:34,384 --> 00:32:36,686
Aren't they, Ari?               

549
00:32:39,556 --> 00:32:40,824
            Is that Ari?        

550
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,692
    Yes.                        

551
00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:46,729
Ari and I have been             
friends for an eternity.        

552
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,798
I suppose you could say         
that our road together          

553
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:51,768
Has been long                   
and hard.                       

554
00:33:01,345 --> 00:33:05,115
Your lessons are refreshing,    
as well as frustrating.         

555
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:09,486
            Then why do you     
            keep coming back?   

556
00:33:09,586 --> 00:33:12,155
        Why don't you stay      
        in your world of princes

557
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:15,124
             <i>With dainty faces,</i> 
             <i>and white knights</i>  

558
00:33:15,225 --> 00:33:18,294
            Full of Grace       
            and pleasantries?   

559
00:33:22,265 --> 00:33:24,367
            Gabriella...        

560
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:43,920
I will always come back,        

561
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:47,256
Even though                     
we're worlds apart.             

562
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,467
        Good-bye, Bonnie.

00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:23,926
She's beautiful.                

566
00:34:25,428 --> 00:34:29,665
            You were told not   
            to enter this room. 

567
00:34:29,766 --> 00:34:32,602
I heard the music.              

568
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:35,738
That woman--                    
who is she?                     

569
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,874
        Her name is Gabriella.  

570
00:34:38,975 --> 00:34:42,044
        Gabriella is a Princess.

571
00:34:42,145 --> 00:34:43,813
A real Princess?

573
00:34:45,782 --> 00:34:49,952
    A lie is a black hole that  
    grows deeper and deeper,    

574
00:34:50,053 --> 00:34:53,623
        Getting blacker         
        and blacker,

happens to stumble into it.     

576
00:34:57,427 --> 00:34:59,061
Then when all                   
are consumed by it--            

577
00:34:59,162 --> 00:35:00,697
Friends, loved ones,            
family, all--                   

578
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:03,399
            Do you know         
            what happens?       

579
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,135
    What?                       

580
00:35:06,236 --> 00:35:10,039
            It turns into       
            a great black beast.

581
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:16,746
        It turns on its creator 
        and devours him or her. 

582
00:35:18,582 --> 00:35:20,850
I never lie,                    
either.                         

583
00:35:22,352 --> 00:35:23,819
        That is good to know.   

584
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:28,491
        Trust is the best way   
        to begin a relationship.

585
00:35:30,193 --> 00:35:33,096
        Now, tell me the truth--

586
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:37,000
        Did you like what you   
        heard from Gabriella?   

587
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:38,501
        It was beautiful.       

588
00:35:38,602 --> 00:35:40,203
Yes, it was.                    

589
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,770
    In fact, you have           
    never heard anything        

590
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:43,673
    Quite so beautiful

591
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:44,941
                No, never!      

592
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:47,977
        And do you know why     
        Gabriella is the best?  

593
00:35:48,078 --> 00:35:50,579
She was born that way?          

594
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:53,283
    Born that way?              

595
00:35:54,317 --> 00:35:55,851
    Born that way?              

596
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:59,789
    No...And yes.               

597
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:03,392
You see, many are born          
with what Gabriella has,        

598
00:36:03,493 --> 00:36:06,595
But few ever become             
what Gabriella is.              

599
00:36:06,696 --> 00:36:10,399
No, Gabriella is the best       
because I made her so.          

600
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,336
She is the product              
of my genius.                   

601
00:36:14,437 --> 00:36:16,773
            You're not very     
            humble, are you?    

602
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:17,873
Humble? Humble.

No,

So, what are you saying?

    I'm a friend                
    of b-Bonnie's.              

987
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:15,168
        Yes, Bonnie speaks      
        highly of you.          

988
01:01:15,269 --> 01:01:17,371
    Really?                     

989
01:01:17,472 --> 01:01:19,406
        She tells me            
        you've got a problem.   

990
01:01:19,507 --> 01:01:21,641
                Sit down.       

991
01:01:37,891 --> 01:01:41,161
There is nothing more mean      
     and ugly in this world     

992
01:01:41,262 --> 01:01:46,833
 Than to have a beautiful gift, 
        a loving spirit,        

993
01:01:46,934 --> 01:01:49,802
         <i>And a desire to give</i>

    don't you, porter?

1003
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:25,872

1004

        He doesn't              
        deserve love!           

1005
01:02:27,842 --> 01:02:29,675
    He's mean and selfish!      

1006
01:02:29,777 --> 01:02:31,645
    He doesn't care about us!   

1007
01:02:31,746 --> 01:02:34,013
        He only cares           
        about himself.          

1008
01:02:34,114 --> 01:02:35,382
        I hate him!             

1009
01:02:35,483 --> 01:02:36,917
        He should love us!      

1010
01:02:37,018 --> 01:02:39,953
        He should take us       
        hiking and fishing      

1011
01:02:40,054 --> 01:02:42,455
        And teach us            
        how to play ball...     

1012
01:02:49,196 --> 01:02:54,501
  Sometimes it takes hard times 
  to make us gentle and strong. 

1013
01:02:54,602 --> 01:02:56,703
How can it do both?             

1014
01:02:56,804 --> 01:03:00,374
It just makes my dad mean.      

1015
01:03:00,475 --> 01:03:02,909
    Meanness isn't strength.    

1016
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:06,246
        Your father             
     is not a strong man...     

1017
01:03:06,347 --> 01:03:09,449
         Not yet anyway.        

1018
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:12,419
            But who knows what  
            tomorrow brings.    

1019
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:15,054
        You mustn't             
         give up on him.        

1020
01:03:15,156 --> 01:03:17,057
        He needs the love       
    of his family now,          

1021
01:03:17,158 --> 01:03:18,725
        Just as you need        
            his love.           

1022
01:03:18,826 --> 01:03:22,862
        And someday you will    
        both get what you need.

1027
01:03:36,944 --> 01:03:39,946
    Now that you mention it,    
    I think it was snow white

  The mirror will show you how  
 you've been made a better man. 

1032
01:03:55,596 --> 01:03:57,930
I don't understand.             

1033
01:03:58,032 --> 01:04:00,534
            You d-d-d-don't?    

1034
01:04:07,041 --> 01:04:09,542
        Wow!                    

1035
01:04:11,512 --> 01:04:14,047
So, you have Cyrano who has     
a nose about a foot long        

1036
01:04:14,148 --> 01:04:16,483
Afraid to tell Roxanne          
he loves her.                   

1037
01:04:16,584 --> 01:04:17,583
She's too beautiful,            

1038
01:04:17,684 --> 01:04:19,552
And he's afraid                 
that she'll laugh at him.       

1039
01:04:19,653 --> 01:04:20,854
Can you imagine it?             

1040
01:04:20,955 --> 01:04:22,522
A guy who just                  
the night before                

1041
01:04:22,623 --> 01:04:26,759
Successfully dueled 100         
assailants scared of a woman!   

1042
01:04:26,861 --> 01:04:28,628
So what does                    
he do about it?                 

1043
01:04:28,729 --> 01:04:31,698
He hires the handsomest man     
he can, named Christian,        

1044
01:04:31,799 --> 01:04:33,966
To "woo" the beautiful Roxanne  

1045
01:04:34,067 --> 01:04:36,770
By saying the things            
that Cyrano writes for him.     

1046
01:04:36,871 --> 01:04:38,471
Well,                           
it just so happens              

1047
01:04:38,572 --> 01:04:40,774
That Roxanne falls in love      
with Christian,                 

1048
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:42,909
But not because he's handsome,  

1049
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:45,412
But because he expresses        
a beautiful soul                

1050
01:04:45,513 --> 01:04:47,914
By the things                   
he says and writes.             

1051
01:04:48,015 --> 01:04:50,583
Problem is that Christian       
also loves Roxanne,             

1052
01:04:50,684 --> 01:04:53,120
But can't tell her              
because he has a hard time      

1053
01:04:53,221 --> 01:04:55,255
Expressing his feelings...      

1054
01:04:55,356 --> 01:04:57,390
    So who get's the girl?
