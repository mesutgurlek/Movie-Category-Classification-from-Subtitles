Gentlemen.

120
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:21,378
I pray you tell me where a gentle maiden
dwelleth named Yum-Yum - the ward of Ko-Ko.

121
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,880
And what may be your business
with Yum-Yum?

122
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,552
A year ago, I saw Yum-Yum.
We loved each other at once...

123
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,555
but she was betrothed to her
guardian Ko-Ko, a cheap tailor...

124
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,557
and I saw that my suit was hopeless.

125
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,642
Judge of my delight when I heard
a month ago...

126
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:38,061
that Ko-Ko had been condemned
to death for flirting.

127
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,647
I hurried back at once, hoping
I should find Yum-Yum at liberty.

128
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:44,067
It is true that Ko-Ko was
condemned to death for flirting.

129
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,194
But he was reprieved
at the last moment...

Ko-Ko, the cheap tailor,
Lord High Executioner of Titipu.

165
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,067
Why, that's the highest rank
a citizen can attain.

166
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,277
It is.

167
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,987
That is Pooh-Bah.

168
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:56,199
Our logical Mikado, seeing no moral
difference between the dignified judge...

169
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,452
who condemns a criminal to die...

170
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,621
and the industrious mechanic
who carries out the sentence...

171
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:04,541
has rolled the two
offices into one...

172
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,295
and every judge is now
his own executioner.

173
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:13,216
But how good of you,
a nobleman of the highest rank...

174
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:17,053
to condescend to tell all this
to me, a mere strolling minstrel.

175
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:20,223
Don't mention it.
I am, in point of fact...

176
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:23,018
a particularly haughty
and exclusive person...

177
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,104
of preadamite ancestral descent.

178
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:30,066
You will understand this when I tell
you that I can trace my ancestry back...

179
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:34,571
to a protoplasmal primordial
atomic globule.

180
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:39,159
Consequently, my family pride
is something inconceivable.

181
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:43,663
I can't help it.
I was born sneering.

182
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,833
But I struggle hard
to overcome this defect.

183
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:50,170
I mortify my pride continually.

184
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,673
When all the great officers
of state resigned in a body...

185
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:57,594
because they were too proud
to serve under an ex-tailor...

186
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:02,390
did I not unhesitatingly accept
all their posts at once?

187
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,351
And the salaries attached to them?

188
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:07,312
- Oh.
- You did.

189
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,440
A Pooh-Bah paid for his services!

190
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:13,068
I a salaried minion!

191
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,653
But I do it.

192
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:18,740
It revolts me, but I do it.

193
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,325
And it does you credit.

194
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,161
But I don't stop at that.

195
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:27,207
I also retail state secrets
at a very low figure.

196
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,960
- For instance -
- Any information about Yum-Yum -

197
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:33,213
Would come under the head
of a state secret.

198
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:42,472
Another insult,
and, I think, a light one.

Oh, Pooh-Bah, Pooh-Bah.

233
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,065
It seems that the
festivities in connection...

234
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:21,966
...with my approaching
marriage must last a week.

235
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,634
Now I should like to do the thing
handsomely, and I want to consult you...

236
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,553
as to the amount I ought to spend
upon them.

237
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,638
Certainly. In which
of my capacities?

238
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:31,808
As first lord of the treasury,
lord chamberlain...

239
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,811
attorney general,
chancellor of the exchequer...

240
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,605
privy purse or private secretary?

241
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,816
Suppose we say as private secretary.

242
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,235
Speaking as your private secretary...

243
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:47,323
I should say that, as the city will have
to pay for it, don't stint yourself.

244
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,409
- Do it well.
- Exactly.

245
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,328
As the city will have to pay for it -
that is your advice.

246
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,498
Of course,
as chancellor of the exchequer...

247
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:59,836
I am bound to see that
due economy is observed.

248
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,048
Oh, but you said just now,
"Don't stint yourself. Do it well."

249
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,050
As private secretary.

250
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,635
And now you say
that due economy must be observed.

251
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,847
As chancellor of the exchequer.

252
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,099
I see.

253
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,854
Come over here where the
chancellor can't hear us.

254
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,981
Now then, as my solicitor...

255
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,609
how would you advise me to
deal with this difficulty?

256
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:26,362
Oh, as your solicitor, I should have
no hesitation in saying "Chance it."

257
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:29,365
- Thanks. I will. - If it were not
that, as lord chief justice...

258
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,703
I am bound to see
that the law isn't violated.

259
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:43,588
Now then,
as first lord of the treasury?

260
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,882
Of course,
as first lord of the treasury...

261
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:50,553
I could propose a special vote
that would cover all expenses -

262
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,972
if it were not that,
as leader of the opposition...

263
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:57,435
it would be my duty
to resist it tooth and nail.

264
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:04,067
Or, as paymaster general,
I could so cook the accounts...

265
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:08,613
that, as lord high auditor,
I should never discover the fraud.

266
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:12,075
But... as archbishop of Titipu...

267
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,411
it would be my duty
to denounce my dishonesty...

268
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:20,917
and give myself into my own custody
as first commissioner of police.

269
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,086
That's extremely awkward.

270
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:28,925
I don't say that all these distinguished
people couldn't be squared.

271
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,262

- Oh, Nanki-Poo!

317
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,698
- I'm so glad! - I haven't
seen you for ever so long!

318
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:45,371
I've come home for good.
And I'm not going back anymore!

319
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:47,790
I beg your pardon,
but will you present me?

320
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,542
Oh, this is the gentleman -

321
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,627
One at a time, please.

322
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:55,298
If you please. He is the gentleman
who used to play so beautifully on the -

323
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,883
Oh, on the, uh - on the -

324
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,551
On the Marine Parade.

325
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,846
Oh, sir, I have the misfortune
to love your ward Yum-Yum.

326
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,973
Oh, I know I deserve your anger.

327
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,017
You -

328
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:16,069
Anger? Not a bit, my boy.

329
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,488
Why, I love her myself.

330
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:22,325
Charming little girl, isn't she?
Pretty eyes, nice hair.

331
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,410
Taking little thing altogether.

332
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:28,664
Very glad to hear my opinion
backed by a competent authority.

333
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:31,334
Thank you very much. Good-bye.

334
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,919
Take him away.

335
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,670
Oh!

336
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,479
Yum-Yum!

337
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,523
Oh, at last we're alone.

338
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,525
I've sought you night and day
for three weeks...

339
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,860
with the belief that your guardian
was beheaded.

340
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:01,364
But now I find that you're about
to be married to him this afternoon.

341
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,949
Yes.

342
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,868
But you do not love him?

343
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:07,120
No.

344
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,205
Oh, why don't you refuse him?

345
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,790
What good would that do?

346
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:14,001
He is my guardian,
and he wouldn't let me marry you.

347
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:18,381
Besides, a wand'ring minstrel who plays
a wind instrument outside teahouses...

348
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,968
is hardly a fitting husband for
the ward of the Lord High Executioner.

349
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:24,554
Oh, but...

350
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:27,306
what if it should prove
that after all I am no musician?

351
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:30,726
There! I was certain of it,
directly I heard you play.

352
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,437
Oh, it -

353
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,632
But what if it should
prove that I am...

354
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:36,733
...the son of His
Majesty the Mikado?

355
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:39,569
- The son of the Mikado?
- Oh! Shh, shh, shh!

356
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,574
But why is Your Highness disguised?

357
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:48,578
And what has Your Highness done? And will
Your Highness promise never to do it again?

358
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:54,041
Some years ago I had the misfortune
to captivate Katisha...

359
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,085
an elderly lady of my father's court.

360
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,755
My father ordered me to marry her
within a week or perish on a scaffold.

361
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,759
That night I fled his court and, assuming
the disguise of a second trombone...

362
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:05,887
I joined the band in

00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,931
I am the bearer of a letter
from His Majesty, the Mikado.

396
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:59,018
A letter from the Mikado?

397
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:06,859
What in the world
can he have to say to me?

398
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,200
Ah, here it is at last.

399
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:19,622
I thought it would come
sooner or late - later.

400
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,131
The Mikado is struck by the fact...

401
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:32,718
that no executions have taken
place in Titipu for a year.

402
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:38,724
And he decrees that unless someone
is beheaded within one month...

403
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:44,647
the post of Lord High Executioner
shall be abolished!

404
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:51,195
And the city reduced
to the rank of a village!

405
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,281
There's no help for it.

406
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,493
I shall have to execute
somebody at once.

407
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:03,207
The only question is,
who shall it be?

408
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,668
Well, it seems unkind to say so...

409
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:09,338
but as you're already under
sentence of death for flirting...

410
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:12,007
everything seems to point to you.

411
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:18,681
To - To me? Wh-What are you talking
about? I can't execute myself.

412
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,349
Why not?

413
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:22,977
I don't see how a man can
cut off his own head.

414
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,771
A man might try.

415
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,858
If he only succeeded
in cutting it half off -

416
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,279
that would be something.

417
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:38,117
No. Pardon me, but
there I am adamant.

418
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:41,746
I am afraid that unless
you can obtain a substitute -

419
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,330
A substitute?

420
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,875
Nothing easier.

421
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:53,549
Pooh-Bah, I appoint you
lord high substitute.

422
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,217
I should be delighted.

423
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:58,888
Such an appointment would
realize my fondest dreams!

424
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,350
But, no, at any sacrifice...

425
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:08,647

This is simply appalling!

481
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,682
Is this public gratitude?

482
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:48,951
What are you going to do
with that rope?

483
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,120
I'm about to terminate
an unendurable existence.

484
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:53,956
Terminate your existence?
Nonsense!

485
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,040
What for?

486
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,042
Because you're going to marry
the girl I adore.

487
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:59,086
Nonsense, sir.
I won't permit it.

488
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,922
I am a humane man, and if you
attempt anything of the kind...

489
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,632
I shall order your instant arrest.

490
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:06,301
Come, sir. Desist at once,
or I summon my guard.

491
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:08,220
That's absurd. If you attempt
to raise an alarm...

492
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,556
I instantly perform the happy
dispatch with this dagger.

493
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,307
No, no! Don't do that!

494
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,146
Why, this is horrible.

495
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,064
You cold-blooded scoundrel.

496
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:22,151
Are you aware that in taking your
life you're committing a crime?

497
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,819
Committing a crime which -

498
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:25,571
which -

499
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,076
The substitute!

500
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,329
What's the matter?

501
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:36,915
Is it absolutely certain
that you're resolved to die?

502
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Absolutely.

503
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,169
- Will nothing shake your
resolution? - Nothing.

504
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,139
Then, if you really
mean what you say,

505
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,340
...don't spoil yourself
by committing suicide...

506
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:48,677
but be beheaded handsomely at
the hands of the public executioner.

507
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:51,180
- I don't see how that would
benefit me. - You don't?

508
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,267
Observe.

509
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:59,354
You'll have a month to live, and you'll
live like a fighting cock at my expense.

510
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:02,191
When the day comes, there'll
be a grand public ceremonial.

511
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,942
You will be the central figure.

512
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:06,653
No one will attempt to deprive you
of that distinction.

513
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:10,199
There'll be a procession,
bands, dead march, bells tolling...

514
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,367
all the girls in tears -

515
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:15,037
Yum-Yum distracted.

516
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,207
Then, when it's all over,
general rejoicings...

517
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:21,543
and a display of fireworks
in the evening!

518
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:24,797
You won't see them, but
they'll be there all the same.

519
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,966
Do you think Yum-Yum will
really be distracted at my death?

520
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:32,721
I'm convinced of it. Bless you, she's the
most tenderhearted little creature alive.

521
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:35,140
I should be sorry to cause her pain.

522
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,726
Perhaps, after all,
if I were to withdraw from Japan...

523
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:41,063
and travel in Europe for a couple of
years, I might contrive to forget her.

524
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,233
Oh, I don't think you could
forget Yum-Yum so easily.

525
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:49,822
And, after all, what is more
miserable than a love-blighted life?

526
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:50,864
True.

527
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:55,244
Life without Yum-Yum.

528
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:58,330
Why, it seems absurd.

529
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:01,333
And yet there are a great many people
in the world who have to endure it.

530
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:06,088
Poor devils, yes! You're quite
right not to be of their number.

531
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,924
I won't be of their number!

532
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,509
Noble fellow!

533
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,094
I'll tell you how we'll manage it.

534
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:15,806
Let me marry Yum-Yum tomorrow...

535
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,599
and in a month you may behead me.

536
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:21,103
No. No. I draw the line at Yum-Yum.

537
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,188
Very good. If you can draw
the line, so can I.

538
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:26,191
No! Stop! Listen one moment!
Be reasonable.

539
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:28,777
She'll be a widow in a month,
and you can marry her then.

540
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:33,365
Yes, that's true, of course.
I quite see that.

541
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:38,036
But dear me. My position during
the next month will be most unpleasant.

542
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:40,372
Most unpleasant.

543
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,749
Not half so unpleasant
as my position at the end of it.

544
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,043
Yes, but dear me -

545
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,629
Oh, very well. I agree.

546
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:51,967
After all, it's only putting off
one's wedding for a month.

547
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,888
But you won't prejudice her
against me, will you?

548
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,765
You see, I've educated
her to be my wife.

549
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,811
She's been taught to regard me
as a wise and good man.

550
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:05,981
Now, I shouldn't like her views
on that point disturbed.

551
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,569

Everything seems to smile upon me.

709
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:38,423
I'm to be married today
to the man I love best...

710
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:40,925
and I believe
I'm the very happiest girl in Japan.

711
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:42,760
Well, dear, it can't be denied...

712
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:45,555
that the fact that your husband
is to be beheaded in a month...

713
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,557
is, in its way, a drawback.

714
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,893
It does seem to
take the top off it, you know.

715
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,186
I don't know about that.
It all depends.

716
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:54,272
At all events, he will
find it a drawback.

717
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:57,442
Not necessarily, bless you.
It all depends.

718
00:53:57,526 --> 00:54:00,403
Oh! I think it very
indelicate of you...

719
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,615
to refer to such a subject
on such a day.

720
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,618
If my married happiness
is to be - to be -

721
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:07,952
Cut short?

722
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:10,496
Well, cut short in a month...

723
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,540
can't you let me forget it?

724
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:28,973
Yum-Yum! Yum-Yum in tears -
and on her wedding morn?

725
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:35,897
They've been reminding me that
in a month you're to be beheaded.

726
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,399
A month? Why, what's a month?

727
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:40,735
These divisions of time
are purely arbitrary.

728
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,737
Who says 24 hours make a day?

729
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,073
There's a popular impression
to that effect.

730
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:47,700
Then we'll efface it.

731
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:50,203
We'll call each second a minute -
each minute an hour...

732
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,622
each hour a day
and each day a year.

733

Oh, at that rate, we've about 30 years
of married happiness before us.

Yes. How time flies when one
is thoroughly enjoying oneself.

735
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:03,675
That's the way to look at it.
Don't let's be downhearted.

00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:34,867
No. I must learn to bear it.

776
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:39,122
Now oblige me by allowing her
head to rest on your shoulder.

777
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,085
Like that?

778
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:47,922
I'm much obliged to you.

779
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:51,217
Now, k -

780
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,510
k- k-k -

781
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,262
kiss her.

782
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,724
Thank you.

783
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:01,811
Thank you.

784
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,896
It's simple torture!

785
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:08,860
Oh. Oh, come, come. Bear up.
After all, it's only for a month.

786
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:13,364
No. It's no use deluding oneself
with false hopes.

787
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:18,703
- What do you mean?
- My child. My poor child.

788
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:22,582
My little bride that
was to have been.

789
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,709
"Was to have been"?

790
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:26,544
You never can be mine.

791
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:27,879
- Oh!
- What?

792
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:29,964
Oh, I'm so glad!

793
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,510
I've just ascertained
that, by the Mikado's law...

794
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:38,222
when a married man is beheaded,
his wife is buried alive.

795
00:58:38,307 --> 00:58:40,600
- Buried alive?
- Buried alive!

796
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,935
Buried alive.

797
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:48,149
It's a most unpleasant death.

798
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:51,652
- But whom did you get that from?
- Oh, from Pooh-Bah.

799
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:54,322
- He's my solicitor.
- But he may be mistaken.

800
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:57,700
So I thought. So I consulted the
attorney general, the lord chief justice...

801
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:00,745
the master of the rolls, the judge
ordinary and the lord chancellor.

802
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:02,705
They're all of the same opinion.

803
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:06,083
Never knew such unanimity
on a point of law in my life.

804
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:08,586
But stop a bit. This law
has never been put in force.

805
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:14,425
Not yet. You see, flirting is the only
crime punishable with decapitation...

806
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:18,012
and married men never flirt.

807
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:23,017
Oh, I quite forgot that.

808
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:28,814
Well, I - I suppose I may take it that
my dream of happiness is at an end.

809
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:31,859
- Darling -
- Yes?

810
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:33,778
Oh.

811
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:35,947
I don't want to appear selfish...

812
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:38,908
and I love you with all my heart.

813
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,202
It makes a difference, doesn't it?

814
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:44,830
You see, burial alive - It's -

815
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:47,124
It's such a stuffy death.

816
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,169
I call it a beast of a death.

817
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:53,089
You see my difficulty, don't you?

818
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,382
Yes.

819
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:58,761
And I see my own. If I insist
on you carrying out your promise...

820
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,763
I doom you to a hideous death.

821
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,932
If I release you,
you marry Ko-Ko at once.

822
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,350

Ko-Ko. Ko-Ko!

866
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:37,711
The Mikado and his suite
are approaching the city -

867
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:40,464
and will be here in 10 minutes.

868
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:42,007
- The Mikado?
- Mmm.

869
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:44,135
He's coming to see
if his orders have been carried out.

870
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:47,513
Oh, I can't live without Yum-Yum. This
afternoon I perform the happy dispatch.

871
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,975
Now look here, you know. This is
getting serious. A bargain's a bargain.

872
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:54,186
As a man of honor and a gentleman,
you are bound to die ignominiously...

873
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:56,772
at the hands of the
public executioner.

874
01:02:56,857 --> 01:02:58,566
Very well then.

875
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:00,818
- Behead me.
- Ooh!

876
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,945
What? Now?

877
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:05,656
Certainly. At once.

878
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,701
Chop it off, Ko-Ko. Chop it off.

879
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:20,838
I don't go about prepared to execute
gentlemen at a moment's notice.

880
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,506
Oh!

881
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:25,176
Why, I never even killed a bluebottle.

882
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:29,013
Oh, come, my poor fellow. After
all, if I don't mind, why should you?

883
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:31,223
Remember.
Sooner or later, it must be done.

884
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:33,934
Must it?

885
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:35,936
I'm not so sure about that.

886
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:37,980
What do you mean?

887
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,502
Why should I kill you
when making an affidavit...

888
01:03:40,503 --> 01:03:42,903
...that you've been executed
will do just as well?

889
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:45,779
Here are plenty of witnesses
the lord chief justice...

890
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:47,449
...the lord high admiral,
commander-in-chief,

891
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:48,950
...secretary of state for
the Home Department...

892
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:52,036
first lord of the treasury and
the chief commissioner of police.

893
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,079
- Where are they?
- There they are.

894
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:57,208
They'll all swear to it. Won't you?

895
01:03:57,292 --> 01:04:00,711
Am I to understand that all
of us high officers of state...

896
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:05,424
are required to perjure ourselves
to ensure your safety?

897
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:08,219
Why not? You'll be grossly
insulted, as usual.

898
01:04:08,303 --> 01:04:11,263
Will the insult be cash down
or at a date?

899
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:13,307
It will be a ready
money transaction.

900
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,643
Oh.

901
01:04:16,228 --> 01:04:17,686
Very good.

902
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:22,399
Choose your fiction,
and I'll endorse it.

903
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:23,859
Ha-ha!

904
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:25,444
Family pride.

905
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:28,072
How do you like that, me buck?

906
01:04:28,156 --> 01:04:29,990
But I tell you that
life without Yum-Yum -

907
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:32,076
Oh, Yum-Yum, Yum-Yum.
Bother Yum-Yum!

908
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:36,413
Take Yum-Yum, and marry Yum-Yum. Only
go away and never come back anymore.

909
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:39,083
- Yum-Yum, are you
particularly busy? - No.

910
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,585
Then go along with His Grace,
the archbishop of Titipu.

911
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:44,088
- He'll marry you at once.
- But if I'm to be buried alive -

912
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:46,715
Don't ask any questions!
Do as I tell you.

913
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,927
- Oh, but one moment. You... - Not for
worlds. If the Mikado finds you alive...

914
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,763
I shall have the greatest difficulty
in persuading him I've beheaded you.

915
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:55,224
Well, now. Wait a minute.
You have to give me a chance -

All this is very interesting,
and I should like to have seen it.

1053
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:11,154
But we came about a
totally different matter.

1054
01:14:11,239 --> 01:14:15,659
A year ago, my son, the heir to the throne
of Japan, bolted from our imperial court.

1055
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:16,993
Indeed?

1056
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:19,996
Had he any reason to be dissatisfied
with his position?

1057
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:23,750
None whatever. On the contrary,
I was going to marry him.

1058
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:26,670
And yet he fled.

1059
01:14:26,754 --> 01:14:31,383
I am surprised that he should
have fled from one so lovely.

1060
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,135
That's not true.

1061
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:34,678
No.

1062
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:39,307
He's now masquerading in this town,
disguised as a second trombone.

1063
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:40,600
A second trombone!

1064
01:14:40,685 --> 01:14:44,104
Yes. Would it be troubling you too
much if I asked you to produce him?

1065
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:46,773
He goes by the name of, uh - of, uh -

1066
01:14:46,858 --> 01:14:49,317
- Nanki-Poo.
- Nanki-Poo.

1067
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:51,111
Nanki-Poo?

1068
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:56,158
Oh, not at all.
It's quite easy. Uh -

1069
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:58,535
Th-That is, it's rather difficult.

1070
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:01,663
In point of fact, he's gone abroad.

1071
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:04,541
Gone abroad?

1072
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:08,920
See here! His name!
Nanki-Poo - beheaded this morning.

1073
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:12,883
Oh, where shall I find another?

1074
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:17,053
Where shall I find another?

1075
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:25,729
Dear, dear, dear.
This is very tiresome.

1076
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:28,982
My poor fellow, in your anxiety
to carry out my wishes...

1077
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:31,526
you've beheaded
the heir to the throne of Japan.

1078
01:15:31,611 --> 01:15:33,820
I beg to offer an unqualified apology.

1079
01:15:33,905 --> 01:15:37,490
I desire to associate myself
with that expression of regret.

1080
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:39,576
We really hadn't the least notion.

1081
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:42,078
Of course you hadn't.
How could you?

1082
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:46,166
If a man of exalted rank chooses
to disguise himself as a second trombone...

1083
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:48,084
he must take the consequences.

1084
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:50,962
I've no doubt he thoroughly
deserved all he got.

1085
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:53,882
We are infinitely
obliged to Your Majesty.

1086
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:55,675
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

1087
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,761
Very much obliged, Your Majesty.

1088
01:15:57,845 --> 01:16:01,723
Obliged? Not a bit. Don't mention it.
How could you tell?

1089
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:04,476
No. Of course we couldn't tell
who the gentleman really was.

1090
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,686
It wasn't written on his forehead,
you know.

1091
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:08,897
It might have been
on his pocket handkerchief...

1092
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:11,900
but Japanese don't use
pocket handkerchiefs.

1093
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:24,412
I forget the punishment for compassing
the death of the heir apparent.

1094
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:26,790
"Punishment."

1095
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:29,000
Hmm. Yes. Uh -

1096
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:30,835
Uh -

1097
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:35,006
Something lingering,
with boiling oil in it, I fancy.

1098
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,175
Something of that sort.

1099
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:40,345
I think boiling oil occurs in it,
but I'm not sure.

1100
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:45,308
And I know it's something
humorous, but lingering -

1101
01:16:45,393 --> 01:16:50,146
with either boiling oil
or melted lead.

1102
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:55,151
Come, come.
Don't fret. I'm not a bit angry.

1103
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:59,239
If Your Majesty will accept our
assurance, we had no idea -

1104
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:01,491
- Of course.
- I knew nothing about it.

1105
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:03,535
I wasn't there.

1106
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:07,038
Unfortunately, the fool of an act says
"compassing the death of the heir apparent."

1107
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:08,123
Yes.

1108
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:10,834
- There's not a word in it
about a mistake. - No.

1109
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:12,919
- Or not knowing.
- No!

1110
01:17:13,004 --> 01:17:15,046
- Or having no notion.
- No.

1111
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:17,882
- Or not being there.
- No.

1112
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:20,176
- There should be, of course.
- Yes.

1113
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:22,887
But there isn't.

1114
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:26,433
That's the slovenly way
these acts are always drawn.

1115
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:30,353
Now, let's see.
About your execution -

1116
01:17:30,438 --> 01:17:32,522
Would after luncheon suit you?

1117
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:36,109
Can you wait till then?

1118
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:39,612
Oh, yes. We can wait till then.

1119
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:43,658
Very well then.
We'll make it tomorrow, after luncheon.

1120
01:17:43,743 --> 01:17:46,619
Um, I shan't want any lunch.

1121
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:54,377
Well! And a nice mess
you've got us into...

1122
01:17:54,462 --> 01:17:57,547
with your nodding head and "the
deference due to a man of pedigree."

1123
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:01,051
Merely corroborative detail,
intended to give artistic verisimilitude...

1124
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:04,220
to an otherwise bald
and unconvincing narrative.

1125
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:07,307
Corroborative detail indeed.
Corroborative fiddlestick.

1126
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:09,309
Oh, you're just as bad as he is...

1127
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:12,729
with your cock-and-a-bull story about
catching his eye and whistling an air.

1128
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:16,399
But that's so like you.
You must put in your oar.

1129
01:18:16,484 --> 01:18:18,943
But how about your big right arm?

1130
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:22,113
Yes. And your snickersnee.

1131
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:24,991
Yeah. Well, well -
Well, never mind about that now.

1132
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,411
There's only one thing to be done.

1133
01:18:28,496 --> 01:18:32,874
Nanki-Poo hasn't started yet.
He must come to life again at once.

1134
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,632
Nanki-Poo! Nanki-Poo!

1135
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:43,510
- I'm a dead man, and I'm off
for my honeymoon. - Oh, wait, wait.

1136
01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:46,596
Nanki-Poo! Nanki-Poo!
I've good news for you.

1137
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,432
- You're reprieved.
- Oh, but it's too late.

1138
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:53,603
Nonsense.
A terrible thing has just happened.

1139
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:56,815
It seems that you are
the son of the Mikado.

1140
01:18:56,899 --> 01:19:00,151
Oh, but that happened some time ago.

1141
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:02,862
Is this a time for airy persiflage?

1142
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:05,031
Your father is here -
and with Katisha.

1143
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:08,660
- My father? And with Katisha?
- Yes. He wants you particularly.

1144
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:11,121
Oh! So does she.

1145
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:14,416
- But he's married now. - Bless me
heart. What has that got to do with it?

1146
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,043
Well, Katisha claims me in
marriage, but I'm married already.

1147
01:19:17,128 --> 01:19:21,339
Consequently, she'll insist on my execution,
and my wife will have to be buried alive.

1148
01:19:21,424 --> 01:19:23,383
I don't know what's to be done.

1149
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:27,470
There's one chance for you. If you
can persuade Katisha to marry you -

1150
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:33,643
Ah, but wait.

1151
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:36,563
I can then come to life without
any fear of being put to death.

1152
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:38,982
I marry Katisha?

1153
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:41,067
I really think it's the only course.

1154
01:19:41,152 --> 01:19:43,862
But, my good girl...

1155
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:45,864
have you seen her?

1156
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:48,450
She's something appalling.

1157
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:52,829
Well, it comes to this: While Katisha is
single, I prefer to be a disembodied spirit.

1158
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:56,875
When Katisha is married, existence
will be as welcome as the flowers in spring.

The miscreant who robbed me
of my love.

But vengeance pursues.

1199

They are heating the cauldron.

1200
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:46,878
Katisha, behold a suppliant
at your feet.

1201
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,921
Katisha, mercy.

1202
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:50,423
Mercy?

1203
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:53,968
Had you mercy on him?

1204
01:22:54,053 --> 01:22:56,971
You have slain my love.

1205
01:22:57,056 --> 01:23:00,642
Well, he is dead,
and where shall I find another?

1206
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:04,687
It takes years to train
a man to love me.

1207
01:23:05,272 --> 01:23:10,360
Where shall I find another?

1208
01:23:14,365 --> 01:23:15,865
Here.

1209
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:18,034
Here!

1210
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:20,119
What?

1211
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:25,083
Katisha, for years I have loved
you with a white-hot passion...

1212
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:29,671
which is slowly but surely
consuming my very vitals!

1213
01:23:34,093 --> 01:23:37,887
Ah, shrink not from me.

1214
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:44,143
Kat -

1215
01:23:45,646 --> 01:23:49,524
Katisha, I dare not
hope for your love...

1216
01:23:49,608 --> 01:23:51,734
but I will not live without it.

1217
01:23:51,819 --> 01:23:53,528
Darling!

1218
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:57,490
You! You, whose hands still reek
with the blood of my betrothed...

1219
01:23:57,574 --> 01:24:01,869
dare to address words of passion to
the woman you have so foully wronged?

1220
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:06,958
I do. Accept my love,
or I perish on the spot!

1221
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:14,924
Go to!

1222
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:19,971
Who knows so well as I that no one
ever yet died of a broken heart.

1223
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:24,767
You know not what you say.

1224
01:24:28,856 --> 01:24:31,065

Ko-Ko!

1259
01:27:13,687 --> 01:27:17,857
Now then, we've had a capital lunch,
and we're quite ready.

1260
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:20,526
Have all the painful
preparations been made?

1261
01:27:20,611 --> 01:27:22,528
Your Majesty, all is prepared.

1262
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:24,780
Then produce the
unfortunate gentleman...

1263
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:28,784
and his two well-meaning
but misguided accomplices.

1264
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:53,893
Mercy for Ko-Ko.
Mercy for Pitti-Sing.

1265
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:56,020
Mercy even for Pooh-Bah.

1266
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:58,648
I beg your pardon. I don't think
I quite caught that remark.

1267
01:27:58,732 --> 01:28:00,858
Mercy even for Pooh-Bah.

1268
01:28:02,903 --> 01:28:04,987
My husband that was
to have been is dead...

1269
01:28:05,072 --> 01:28:08,616
and I have just married
this, uh, miserable object.

1270
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:14,914
Oh. You've not been long about it.

1271
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:18,334
No. We were married
before the registrar.

1272
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:20,586
I am the registrar.

1273
01:28:20,671 --> 01:28:21,837
I see.

1274
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:26,092
But my difficulty is that, as
you have slain the heir apparent -

1275
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:43,567
- The heir apparent is not slain.
- Bless my heart. My son!

1276
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:46,445
And your daughter-in-law-elected.

1277
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:49,407
Traitor! You have deceived me!

1278
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:52,326
Yes. You are entitled to
a little explanation...

1279
01:28:52,411 --> 01:28:55,830
but I think he'll give it better whole
than in pieces.

1280
01:28:57,958 --> 01:29:02,503
Your Majesty, it's quite true that
I stated that I had killed Nanki-Poo.

1281
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:05,089
Yes, with most affecting particulars.

1282
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:07,216
It's like this, Your Majesty:

1283
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,385
When your Majesty says,
"Let a thing be done"...

1284
01:29:09,469 --> 01:29:12,138
that thing is as good as done -
practically, it is done -

1285
01:29:12,222 --> 01:29:14,557
because Your Majesty's will is law.

1286
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:16,809
Your Majesty says,
"Kill a gentleman" -

1287
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:19,562
Well, a gentleman is
told off to be killed.

1288
01:29:19,646 --> 01:29:22,064
Consequently,
that gentleman is as good as dead -

1289
01:29:22,149 --> 01:29:24,692
practically, he is dead.

1290
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,738
Well, if he is dead,
why not say so?

1291
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:33,159
I see. Nothing could possibly
be more satisfactory.
