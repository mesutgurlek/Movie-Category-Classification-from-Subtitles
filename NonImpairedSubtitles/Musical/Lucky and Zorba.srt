1
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:26,410
It's time. I prepare dinner.

2
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,715
But in the meantime can play rhymes?

3
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:30,017
With what?

4
00:00:34,462 --> 00:00:35,272
With a word "cat".

5
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,093
Starved cat is eating again...

6
00:00:38,408 --> 00:00:41,226
Opening the fridge and finding... an egg?

7
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:47,107
Egg belongs to cat, a cat is hatching it

8
00:00:47,668 --> 00:00:49,786
An insane kitty, who's
giving him heat.

9
00:00:50,223 --> 00:00:52,434
They're prowling, flying so far.

10
00:00:52,947 --> 00:00:54,871
The egg breaks and appears a...

11
00:00:55,303 --> 00:00:57,024
...seagull!

12
00:00:58,555 --> 00:01:00,249
Little soul of equilibrist.

13
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:02,470
Nothing in the world makes him so glad

14
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,274
as that unexpected drips

15
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:07,837
what brings the wind, what
brings the sun.

16
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:09,991
That is beautiful!

17
00:01:10,598 --> 00:01:12,373
Yes, it is. It should be saved.

18
00:01:12,857 --> 00:01:15,663
What brings the wind, what
brings the sun...

19
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,151
And now, attention!

20
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:22,853
A final frightening!

21
00:01:22,853 --> 00:01:25,995
As black as oil, with a thousand red eyes.

22
00:01:26,414 --> 00:01:28,862
From their black lairs look eyes of rats.

23
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:33,133
In a town, what sleeps and dreams,
they bug out, bug out...

24
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:34,774
rats from ditchs.

25
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:37,565
What are you doing, little ones!

26
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:40,407
They bug out, bug out from dumpsters

27
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:45,962
strong and powerful, ferocious rats.

28
00:01:46,645 --> 00:01:48,590
What eat cats!

29
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,656
Dinner is ready!

30
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,650
LUCKY AND ZORBA

~ It's hard, but someone have to do it ~

32
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:32,685
~ It's hard to not always be what you want ~

33
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:42,617
~ It's hard, but this someone is us ~

34
00:02:44,892 --> 00:02:48,767
~ They are asking us, why we do that ~

34
00:02:49,892 --> 00:02:54,267
~ They're all standing aside, here's why ~

35
00:02:55,565 --> 00:03:00,565
~ I take a look to understand that ~

36
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:05,883
~ what you've throw out, may be useful to me ~

37
00:03:07,155 --> 00:03:10,000
~ It's hard, but someone have to do it ~

~ It's hard to not always be what you want ~

39
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:31,282
Move on, quickly, unload!

40
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,301
~ We continue to work ~

41
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,150
~ Each of us multiplies it more ~

42
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:48,375
~ While hideous cats consume crunchy food ~

43
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:51,743
~ The effort what we make ~

44
00:03:52,195 --> 00:03:53,865
~ Soon will give us an reward ~

45
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:56,613
~ The moment is coming ~

46
00:03:57,048 --> 00:04:00,357
~ Soon all that city will belong to us ~

47
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,794
It's hard to accept, but that
disgusting rat is right...

48
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,113
Even if so... That stinkers
become every day more fat

49
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:19,074
and more numerous.

50
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:22,096
For all rats! It smells so disgusting!

51
00:04:25,675 --> 00:04:27,119
Quiet, youngster.

52
00:04:27,549 --> 00:04:28,932
We can not stay indifferent!

53
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:30,319
We must do something!

54
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:31,816
Right, Diderot?

55
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:34,799
Thus masa multiplied by 3.14...

56
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:38,224
Considering hydraulic
lever arm...

57
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:40,144
It is brilliant!

58
00:04:40,244 --> 00:04:41,728
Have you heard me, clever one?

59
00:04:42,227 --> 00:04:43,207
We must do something!

60
00:04:43,787 --> 00:04:44,791
- Evidently, Zorba.
- So?

61
00:04:45,764 --> 00:04:47,680
This, what do we do, namely what will you do,

62
00:04:48,226 --> 00:04:49,698
is to climb up to the command cabin

63
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,503
and... do you see?

64
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:53,826
Press the red button
to turn round the lever arm.

65
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,682
Green one, to lift the weight.

66
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:57,530
Yellow one, to move it into a truck.

67
00:04:57,954 --> 00:05:00,255
Violet one, to release weight,
making it fall into...

68
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,309
Yes, and then the supercat
is gonna make a carnage,

69
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:06,298
breaks them tails and smash
theirs stinky mugs!

70
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:07,987
What are you doing here, Small Ball?

71
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:09,929
I came to help Zorba
deal with him, grandpa.

72
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:18,992
So, "supercat", are you ready?

73
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:24,758
Move forward, and I,
the supercat, will cover you.

74
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,294
- Go ahead, Secretary.
- Me?

75
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:29,628
Why just me?

76
00:05:29,628 --> 00:05:32,025
Becouse you are a robust and courageous cat.

77
00:05:32,544 --> 00:05:35,898
Yes, sure, but I am extremely
allergic to trash...

78
00:05:35,998 --> 00:05:37,440
Go, young one!

79
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,440
Let's go!

79
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,740
Courage!

80
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,451
For all rats!

81
00:06:02,944 --> 00:06:05,065
Which one press? Red, green...

82
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:11,775
- It wasn't so powerful, just small sneeze...
- Shut up!

83
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,954
Click the buttons!

84
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:45,717
- How's it going?
- I do not know!

85
00:06:50,134 --> 00:06:52,675
What are orders, great rat?

86
00:06:54,485 --> 00:06:55,406
Enough, get out of here!

87
00:06:55,777 --> 00:06:57,777
Leave it!

88
00:07:03,746 --> 00:07:06,346
Retreat!

89
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:10,854
Now comes the supertomcat
and makes meatballs!

90
00:07:15,094 --> 00:07:17,134
Run for your life!

91
00:07:51,144 --> 00:07:55,052
For nothing sighs as much
as for that rain...

92
00:07:55,662 --> 00:07:57,927
A rain that falls from the sky

93
00:07:58,016 --> 00:07:59,878
and dews the sea.

94
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:14,100
Good evening!

95
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:18,880
Miss, let me introduce myself

96
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:22,564
My name is Colonel of cats from port...

97
00:08:22,595 --> 00:08:24,848
Please excuse us we bother you,

98
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:28,609
but by accident we were followed
hier by those uncivilized rats.

99
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:31,753
We even have one wounded.

100
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:32,565
Who?

101
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:33,718
Me?

102
00:08:33,818 --> 00:08:36,052
No, Colonel, overact!...

103
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:38,948
I am very delighted.

104
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,822
Bubulina Siamese.

105
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:43,744
The pleasure is mine.

106
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:45,897
Zorba the Cat.

107
00:08:45,907 --> 00:08:47,007
It hurts heavily?

108
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:48,501
Does it hurt?

109
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:51,316
No, I swear, it's nothing.
Just a scratch.

110
00:08:51,554 --> 00:08:54,440
I am sure he was great!

111
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,244
And really enormous!

112
00:08:56,876 --> 00:08:58,336
And Zorba crushed them all!

113
00:08:58,564 --> 00:09:00,564
But if am I...

114
00:09:00,753 --> 00:09:02,413
"If it was me", Small Ball.

115
00:09:03,244 --> 00:09:08,803
If it was me I would have grabbed that
inflated rat and blasted from bottom

116
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:10,820
and then I would...

117
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:13,521
Bubulina, what are you doing?

118
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:15,416
Hide yourself, quick!

119
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,181
Move on, youngster!

120
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:30,968
Come on, Small Ball!

121
00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:33,754
Who are you?

122
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:37,350
Who is it, Bubulina? Your fiancé?

123
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:41,426
Aren't you impolite for her, crumb?

124
00:09:41,777 --> 00:09:43,269
Oh, hi!

125
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:48,918
Nina, come inside before
the rain begins!

126
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,941
Be right back, dad!

127
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,615
Come on, run to your friends
before the rain begins!

128
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:04,431
Do you want to hear how I have
changed the poem about seagulls?

129
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,987
Their little acrobat heart

130
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:10,638
for nothing sighs as much

131
00:10:10,673 --> 00:10:15,557
as for that silly drips... which
almost always brings wind and sun.

132
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:16,884
But it doesn't rhyme!

133
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:19,118
It became a poem for the great.

134
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:21,192
It grew up and lost the rhyme!

135
00:10:21,802 --> 00:10:22,863
But is a shame!

136
00:11:32,998 --> 00:11:35,936
Seagulls! Frizzoni island on the right!

137
00:11:36,835 --> 00:11:39,440
Prepare yourself for a settle!

138
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,029
Hi! Where are you from?

139
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:48,132
From the Baltic Sea. And you?

140
00:11:48,794 --> 00:11:50,625
From here, nearly. From North Sea.

141
00:11:51,246 --> 00:11:52,236
Paro island.

142
00:11:52,857 --> 00:11:55,392
I return home from my first migration.

143
00:11:56,553 --> 00:11:58,625
And now I am going to lay egg.

144
00:11:59,124 --> 00:12:00,671
You know, my first egg!

145
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:02,643
Big congratulations!

146
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:05,516
Being a mother is a wonderful experience.

147
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,298
I'm a happy father.

148
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:10,138
I am not uneducated.
My name is Igor!

149
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,751
Hello, Igor! My name is Kenga.

150
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,790
Hi, Colonel!

151
00:12:24,564 --> 00:12:27,386
I heard that last night you've
given them a hefty spanking!

152
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:29,836
Can you say it out loud?

153
00:12:30,745 --> 00:12:31,927
It was not so!...

154
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:33,139
Silence, youngster!

155
00:12:33,517 --> 00:12:35,077
Nose up with dignity!

156
00:12:35,236 --> 00:12:37,439
You have given them a good lesson!

157
00:12:37,768 --> 00:12:41,287
Since the time of the second
war for independence from canines

158
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:43,080
I haven't had so much fun!

159
00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:45,312
Yes, sir, those were hard times.

160
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:48,584
Dogs was made masters, and
for us, cats, was no rescue.

161
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,175
In that time we couldn't
move freely on the street.

162
00:12:54,526 --> 00:12:56,940
One day, when I could not stand it any more,

163
00:12:57,191 --> 00:13:00,532
we mobilize us in mass and force
them to return to their places.

164
00:13:00,601 --> 00:13:02,105
Get out of here!

165
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,798
The problem is, that young ones
today have quite different concerns.

166
00:13:18,175 --> 00:13:19,865
Grandpa, why is that guy doing this?

167
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,490
I think his stomach a little hurts.

168
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,899
He fall in love.

169
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:26,965
And it hurts so bad?

170
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:30,338
No, but it happens that a male
cat finds a female cat and...

171
00:13:30,507 --> 00:13:32,264
Enough, Secretary!

172
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:37,784
Do something useful and obtain
much fat from friendly sellers above.

173
00:13:37,993 --> 00:13:39,405
Yes, sir, to order!

174
00:13:41,508 --> 00:13:45,361
Becouse of it they both hug
and meow all night?

175
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:48,625
No... Becouse of...

176
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,922
Then they don't make kittens?

177
00:13:55,591 --> 00:13:57,647
You have the nerve to show up here?

178
00:13:58,047 --> 00:13:59,925
Do you know, what rats did last night?

179
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:02,444
Ate two boxes of hake!

180
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:04,644
You are worth nothing, vamoose!

181
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:17,268
How strange! What are those
colored sheets over ships?

182
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:20,466
Flags. People call them so.

183
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,915
Each flag corresponds to one country

184
00:14:23,527 --> 00:14:25,324
and each country corresponds
to a different language.

185
00:14:25,912 --> 00:14:29,163
Oh, yes! And how do people understand
with each other when they talk?

186
00:14:29,876 --> 00:14:31,291
Sardine on the right!

187
00:14:38,638 --> 00:14:39,748
Come on, Kenga!

188
00:14:45,828 --> 00:14:47,456
It's really good, isn't it?

189
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:49,856
I have never eaten so good fish!

190
00:14:50,318 --> 00:14:51,673
Let's catch one more!

191
00:14:51,773 --> 00:14:52,780
Go ahead!

192
00:14:58,746 --> 00:15:00,083
Danger, danger!

193
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,281
What is happening?
I see everything in black!

194
00:15:14,397 --> 00:15:15,501
And the sea is black!

195
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:23,149
That's oil, the people curse.

196
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:26,629
I am unable to fly!

197
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:29,783
Go on, Kenga, the flock cannot
wait, you have to fly!

198
00:15:30,578 --> 00:15:32,254
Do not manage!

199
00:15:32,354 --> 00:15:34,222
Come on, before the flock departs!

200
00:15:35,371 --> 00:15:36,461
Do not leave me here!

201
00:15:37,406 --> 00:15:39,776
You can't save yourself from people curse.

202
00:15:40,446 --> 00:15:43,974
Inhale air as much as you can,

203
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:47,457
then dive into the water, wash yourself

204
00:15:48,457 --> 00:15:50,457
and with all strength try to
get out of the black lacquer!

205
00:15:50,513 --> 00:15:53,513
You must succeed, for your egg!

207
00:16:49,804 --> 00:16:51,589
Bravo, we present just for food!

208
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:54,424
But where have you been all night?

209
00:16:55,923 --> 00:16:58,372
How squeamish you are!
What happened to you?

210
00:16:58,766 --> 00:16:59,933
You have a fight with someone?

211
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,521
Mommy's pretty boy!

212
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,756
Stay there as I bring you some tucker.

213
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:46,084
Please do not eat me!

214
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,224
Do not eat me!

215
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,846
To eat you? It even didn't
go through my head!

216
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,936
How strong stink!

217
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,926
But how you get like this?

218
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,042
I got into a black wave, what
people let out into the sea.

219
00:18:01,962 --> 00:18:03,460
- Oil?
- Yes.

220
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,801
And I feel I am going to die.

221
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:08,506
How: to die? You're just tired and dirty!

222
00:18:09,704 --> 00:18:11,415
Do not manage!

223
00:18:12,488 --> 00:18:13,936
That was my last flight.

224
00:18:20,587 --> 00:18:21,888
It's so disgusting!

225
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:24,404
Anyway thank you, my friend!

226
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:26,439
Friend? What are you saying?

227
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:28,299
Cats and seagulls were never friends.

228
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,139
Not a chance. I'm gonna
never clean her like that.

229
00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:36,681
I really have to go for help.

230
00:18:37,404 --> 00:18:38,246
Wait!

232
00:18:41,074 --> 00:18:45,160
With my last strength
I will try to lay my egg.

233
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,801
But I have to ask you for
promise me three things.

234
00:18:51,371 --> 00:18:53,567
Promises? Forget it!

235
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:54,985
I am dying!

236
00:18:55,522 --> 00:18:57,346
I can't wait any longer, please!

237
00:19:00,593 --> 00:19:01,863
All right, I promise, I promise!

238
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:03,543
What's that?

239
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:06,672
Firstly: promise me not to eat an egg.

240
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,126
Agree. What else?

241
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,917
Secondly: promise you'll take care
of it, until the baby hatch.

242
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:17,140
And the last thing:

243
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,140
promise me you teach him to fly.

244
00:19:20,141 --> 00:19:20,891
To fly?

245
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:22,245
But I'm a cat!

246
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:25,247
But you have a great spirit like a seagull!

247
00:19:25,553 --> 00:19:27,108
Will you do what I've asked you?

248
00:19:27,553 --> 00:19:29,599
Okay, okay, I promise.

249
00:19:30,156 --> 00:19:31,744
Now I go to seek help.

250
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:47,674
Grandpa, look, it's Zorba!

251
00:19:50,962 --> 00:19:52,938
Welcome, youngster! How may I serve you?

252
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:54,409
I have no time, Colonel!

253
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,067
I need a help and an advice.

254
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,043
These people are a bit quirky!

255
00:20:15,408 --> 00:20:17,408
Build new museums and then abandon them.

256
00:20:17,608 --> 00:20:20,227
One so beautiful in center of the city!

257
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,244
You know, the last rational people
were during time of ancient Egyptians,

258
00:20:24,979 --> 00:20:28,155
who worshiping god-cat
by built the pyramids.

259
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:29,803
A sphinx, Colonel!

260
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:31,998
And what have I said? A sphinx!

261
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:35,184
And with what kind of people
we have to live instead?

262
00:20:35,718 --> 00:20:39,740
They treat us as if we were
some stupid dog-like vermins!

263
00:20:42,232 --> 00:20:43,732
An horrible horribleness!

264
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:46,949
Rats, that ignorants, ate a page of an atlas!

265
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:48,908
I have lost Portugal!

266
00:20:49,064 --> 00:20:51,900
We can repay it to them too, son,

267
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,255
but be careful now!

268
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,473
We have another problem!

269
00:20:56,748 --> 00:20:58,812
S... S as "seagull"...

270
00:20:59,076 --> 00:21:01,256
What invention irresistible
that encyclopedia!

271
00:21:01,456 --> 00:21:03,395
Every time you flick it, you learn something new.

272
00:21:03,602 --> 00:21:08,044
Grandpa, what's that... enciploredia?

273
00:21:08,144 --> 00:21:10,037
It is said "encyclopedia".

274
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,190
Sure, Small Ball, it is said the encyclopedia.

275
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:18,905
It's a big store that sells cycles with pedals
of all types, cycles, bicycle...

276
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:24,255
Actually it's a great book of science, where
is information about all things of the world.

277
00:21:24,924 --> 00:21:27,924
Of the world, that is.
That I wanted to say too.

278
00:21:29,564 --> 00:21:32,578
Sea... Seafront... Seagull!

279
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:36,161
What does it say?
Oh, yes, perfect!

280
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,161
His flesh is hard a bit,
but absolutely edible!

281
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:41,588
It's terrible, but they do not
explained clear enough.

282
00:21:42,445 --> 00:21:45,610
Seagull of filth, gull anointed
served with oil, seagull full of stains...

283
00:21:45,776 --> 00:21:46,876
Brilliant!

284
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:49,026
I found!

285
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:52,476
Stain removal!

286
00:21:53,742 --> 00:21:58,326
I found. Remove the stains... a damp
cloth... gasoline...

287
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,566
We need a gasoline!

288
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,019
The problem is resolved, son -
we must get a gasoline.

289
00:22:04,633 --> 00:22:06,443
I wish to know how! We are cats!

290
00:22:06,953 --> 00:22:10,797
We can not go to the gas station to ask:
"20 liters of petrol Super, please!"

291
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,374
20 liters of petrol Super, please!

292
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:14,281
Immediately, sir!

293
00:22:24,007 --> 00:22:24,738
Who are you?

294
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,261
Poor little one!

295
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:27,971
Where's your mom?

296
00:22:32,574 --> 00:22:34,911
- No, please, no.
- Stop lamenting and go ahead!

297
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,954
- Why me?
- Because of the longer tail.

298
00:22:55,884 --> 00:22:57,705
I was brave as you, Zorba!

299
00:22:57,905 --> 00:23:00,438
That gas station bumpkin has thought as a fool

300
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:02,933
There cannot be anyone...

301
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,292
Hurry up!

302
00:23:11,706 --> 00:23:13,706
For all rats!

303
00:23:14,914 --> 00:23:15,811
Too late!

304
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,595
We have to close the wings.

305
00:23:22,302 --> 00:23:23,288
What's doing, sleep?

306
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:25,154
No, she flew in the sky.

307
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,255
How?

308
00:23:26,651 --> 00:23:28,677
She flew up there without using wings?

309
00:23:28,777 --> 00:23:30,632
- Becouse...
- An egg! An egg!

310
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:32,898
For all rats! What do
I do with an egg?

311
00:23:32,907 --> 00:23:35,161
- A good omelet!
- Omelet?

312
00:23:35,902 --> 00:23:36,615
An optimal idea!

313
00:23:37,107 --> 00:23:39,778
In an encyclopedia we can find, how
to prepare an omelet with flakes.

314
00:23:40,129 --> 00:23:41,590
No, paws down, we can't touch that egg.

315
00:23:41,698 --> 00:23:44,325
I'd feel a... a murderer.

316
00:23:44,935 --> 00:23:45,553
A murderer?

317
00:23:46,097 --> 00:23:47,897
Zorba, do not tell me it's your first egg!

318
00:23:48,097 --> 00:23:49,830
I want an explanation, young one.

319
00:23:49,915 --> 00:23:51,877
Why do you keep so much the seagull egg?

320
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,708
Because... I have promised.

321
00:23:55,256 --> 00:23:57,741
Secretary, what is he saying?
What promise is talking about?

322
00:23:59,566 --> 00:24:00,871
I promised not to eat that egg...

323
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:02,769
to care for a chick, what will be born...

324
00:24:03,181 --> 00:24:04,751
and that'll teach him to fly.

325
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,850
She was feeling so bad...

326
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:10,581
A sad story, but you get
in big trouble, young man!

327
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,711
And you think you are able to
respect these promises?

328
00:24:13,363 --> 00:24:15,102
Zorba always respects
promises, what he makes!

329
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:16,422
Of course I respect, but...

330
00:24:16,972 --> 00:24:18,616
I do not know, how to care for an egg.

331
00:24:19,116 --> 00:24:21,265
If that can be done by some stupid birds,

332
00:24:21,922 --> 00:24:24,590
we, cats, can do that three
thousands times better for sure!

333
00:24:24,747 --> 00:24:26,019
It's extremely simple!

334
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:28,300
Volume "E", keyword "egg".

335
00:24:28,838 --> 00:24:31,455
No need an encyclopedia.
We are talking about hatching.

336
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:32,526
What hatching?

337
00:24:32,883 --> 00:24:35,397
It can not be! There was
never a hatching by a cat!

338
00:24:35,829 --> 00:24:37,137
It's beneath us!

339
00:24:37,764 --> 00:24:40,700
It means heat transmission
to the egg from the mother.

340
00:24:41,097 --> 00:24:42,107
Mother?
What mother?

341
00:24:42,503 --> 00:24:44,062
You have to wrap around the egg.

342
00:24:44,355 --> 00:24:45,520
Slowly, do not crush it!

343
00:24:47,357 --> 00:24:48,976
Maybe, but I think it's 
very uncomfortable.

344
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:52,007
How long should I sit
motionless in the nest?

345
00:24:53,478 --> 00:24:56,296
An hour, a month... how long?

346
00:24:56,847 --> 00:24:59,072
We'll get that info in Diderot's
encyclopedia and tell you.

347
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:36,284
~ A short, but beautiful
flight is life of mine ~

348
00:25:39,865 --> 00:25:46,405
~ But it does not lead any regrets ~

349
00:25:49,272 --> 00:25:56,746
~ With my wings on the blue sky ~

350
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:07,421
~ Nothing was more beautiful
than to fly up there ~

351
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:12,197
~ But I am sad, because... ~

352
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:18,275
~ Because I will not be with you ~

353
00:26:19,105 --> 00:26:23,307
~ You are looking for me ~

354
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:28,781
~ But I will not be near to you ~

355
00:26:30,391 --> 00:26:33,389
~ And I pray ~

356
00:26:34,182 --> 00:26:39,413
~ That true friends would help you ~

357
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:49,972
~ Until you grow a little ~

358
00:26:50,761 --> 00:26:58,826
~ And if I will be no longer
able to do it, you will fly... ~

359
00:27:00,996 --> 00:27:05,340
~ You will fly... ~

361
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:16,327
My dear fellow cats,

362
00:27:16,651 --> 00:27:18,783
We are gathered here
in this moonlit night

363
00:27:18,934 --> 00:27:22,886
to give last salute
an young unlucky seagull.

364
00:27:23,805 --> 00:27:26,970
It is saddened, that she
left us, but especially

365
00:27:27,911 --> 00:27:30,546
our hearts are crying
for the way she left,

366
00:27:30,646 --> 00:27:33,011
killed by human folly,

367
00:27:33,687 --> 00:27:37,721
which one day will destroy
the wild and wonderful world,

368
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:40,684
what mother nature has given us.

369
00:27:41,302 --> 00:27:45,066
And now, all miaow together
the moon farewell song

370
00:27:45,774 --> 00:27:47,586
of us, of cats from port.

371
00:28:05,381 --> 00:28:07,498
Shut up, imbecile, you
want to be discovered?

372
00:28:09,515 --> 00:28:10,698
They certainly went mad!

373
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:12,164
It is terribly cold!

374
00:28:12,681 --> 00:28:15,467
I wouldn't say. In fact the temperature
is above the average in season.

375
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:16,910
Look!

376
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:18,601
For me this is a polar cold!

377
00:28:19,104 --> 00:28:20,364
Even doesn't seem so!

378
00:28:20,755 --> 00:28:22,233
Excuse me.

379
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:35,925
Is icily!

380
00:28:55,156 --> 00:28:57,484
Cat's egg! I'm gonna scoff it!

381
00:28:58,545 --> 00:28:59,421
What do you say?

382
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:00,936
You are stupid? It's unsafe!

383
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:04,612
- Unsafe?
- How do you imagine a cat lays an egg?

384
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:22,299
So if cats begin to make eggs,
wont take long as they become...

385
00:29:29,628 --> 00:29:32,833
I have told you, sir, that dry food was
predicting to have strong side effects...

386
00:29:33,882 --> 00:29:36,513
Crisps it's corruption of cats.

387
00:29:37,363 --> 00:29:39,372
It's the way that's going to lead us

388
00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:41,869
to power and to light!

389
00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:46,327
What are you doing here yet?

390
00:29:47,317 --> 00:29:50,251
We are waiting for orders, Your Holiness!

391
00:29:51,611 --> 00:29:53,560
Our orders were given!

392
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,511
Give me the report!

393
00:30:08,602 --> 00:30:10,323
Zorba, what are you playing?

394
00:30:11,068 --> 00:30:11,800
What do you have there?

395
00:30:12,366 --> 00:30:13,403
Come on, show me.

397
00:30:29,572 --> 00:30:30,465
What's happening?

398
00:30:31,968 --> 00:30:33,521
What do you try to tell me?

399
00:30:34,244 --> 00:30:35,036
Wait, let me think.

400
00:30:36,822 --> 00:30:37,612
Egg...

401
00:30:37,988 --> 00:30:39,048
You want to eat it!

402
00:30:39,148 --> 00:30:42,638
Egg... in throat!

403
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,380
I didn't know you were so funny!

404
00:30:54,214 --> 00:30:57,470
I have good news! I discovered how
long an seagull egg should be hatched.

405
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,043
How long?

406
00:30:59,381 --> 00:31:00,446
Only 20 days!

407
00:31:02,011 --> 00:31:03,648
For all heavens cats! An eternity!

408
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,692
Hi!

409
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,530
What are you doing on the ground?

410
00:31:48,702 --> 00:31:53,343
I thought I saw... Ciao, how are you?

411
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:56,015
Good, and you? I have not seen you yet.

412
00:31:56,579 --> 00:31:59,303
Well, you know, I'm a busy cat,
I have a lot of things to do.

413
00:31:59,748 --> 00:32:01,924
Excuse me, but now
I have to go, I'm sorry.

414
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:04,251
See you in a few days.

415
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,500
Zorba, it is true what they meows around?

416
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:09,064
Is that true, that you are
an hatching seagull egg?

417
00:32:09,765 --> 00:32:10,574
An egg? What egg?

418
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,552
You hear, what that cats came up with!

419
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:16,121
I simply stayed in home,
because I had fever.

420
00:32:16,378 --> 00:32:17,149
Hideously cold.

421
00:32:18,969 --> 00:32:20,969
- Not!
- What happened?

422
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:23,597
What have I done?

424
00:32:30,386 --> 00:32:32,079
- What you said?
- Nothing.

425
00:32:33,501 --> 00:32:37,050
Excuse me, Bubulina, but I'm busy,
you don't know how busy!

426
00:32:37,702 --> 00:32:38,558
I am very busy!

427
00:32:39,316 --> 00:32:40,410
You are sure that you okay?

428
00:32:40,714 --> 00:32:41,870
You need something?

429
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,347
- No! I feel very good!
- Bye!

431
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:55,491
Mom, mom, I'm hungry!

433
00:32:56,996 --> 00:32:58,396
So was born a cat-chick.

434
00:32:59,002 --> 00:33:00,604
We have to go to the Great Rat.

435
00:33:01,058 --> 00:33:02,602
- HUNGRY!
- Yes, yes, alright.

436
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:05,698
Now I will bring you...
What bring to you?

437
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:08,533
- What do you eat?
- Papa, papa, papa!

438
00:33:15,691 --> 00:33:17,201
Here is your "papa".

439
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:30,935
It's good, isn't it?

441
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:39,323
I want papa!

442
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:40,862
I go to see what I can find.

443
00:33:42,326 --> 00:33:43,085
Now!

444
00:33:43,698 --> 00:33:45,073
But what if it will grow?

445
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:05,969
Puss-puss... Puss-puss...

446
00:34:11,165 --> 00:34:12,360
It comes...

447
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,413
Just a bit more, closer...

449
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:29,375
Mom, I'm hungry!

450
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,530
I want papa!

451
00:34:36,132 --> 00:34:37,053
Mom, I'm hungry!

452
00:34:43,898 --> 00:34:45,452
Good papa!

453
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,219
Mom, I'm hungry!

454
00:34:51,188 --> 00:34:53,310
Look at him, bulging one is adapting!

455
00:35:02,153 --> 00:35:03,622
I'm so sleepy, mommy!

456
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,350
Listen, baby, I am sorry,

457
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,312
but I am not your mom.

458
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:10,452
But yeah, sure you are!

459
00:35:12,213 --> 00:35:16,433
You're the mom, who is
the best on the world.

460
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:20,509
Zorba, where are you?

461
00:35:21,221 --> 00:35:22,909
Mom, where am I?

462
00:35:23,463 --> 00:35:25,242
Here you are? You keep me company.

463
00:35:25,702 --> 00:35:26,805
I want to change ground in pots.

464
00:35:28,088 --> 00:35:30,373
I need a small vessel for those violets.

465
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:32,762
Where I left it then?

466
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:34,478
Well well!

467
00:35:39,149 --> 00:35:41,582
Zorba, you're naughty!
What's wrong today?

468
00:35:48,228 --> 00:35:50,525
What are you doing, do you want
to break also the another?

469
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,093
What's wrong, Zorba, you feel bad?

470
00:36:09,617 --> 00:36:12,558
I understood, buster,
it's time of your crunching.

471
00:36:13,131 --> 00:36:15,165
Ok then, I bring you now.

472
00:36:17,165 --> 00:36:18,844
Stay here quietly, I will back soon.

473
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,628
Here you are!

474
00:36:25,252 --> 00:36:26,519
Help!

475
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,519
Help, mom!

477
00:36:45,213 --> 00:36:47,869
They wanted to eat me, mommy.

478
00:36:48,586 --> 00:36:50,586
We eating a baby? What an idea!

479
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:53,948
No, know that we
are vegetarians, lady!

480
00:36:54,576 --> 00:36:55,226
Lady?

481
00:36:56,717 --> 00:36:59,427
No, I was wrong.
Anyway have a lovely baby!

482
00:37:00,164 --> 00:37:04,014
I'm sure it becomes
a big and beautiful cat.

483
00:37:04,772 --> 00:37:07,069
There's no a cat, it's a seagull chick.

484
00:37:07,649 --> 00:37:09,912
Exactly, it's what I always say.

485
00:37:10,483 --> 00:37:11,712
Seagull chicks are the most beautiful.

486
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,364
All would like to have one.

487
00:37:13,243 --> 00:37:15,149
Yes. Be seagulls.

488
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,326
Have a good day, madam.

489
00:37:17,771 --> 00:37:19,605
And you too, mommy chick, bye.

490
00:37:20,349 --> 00:37:23,285
You are the strongest mom at the world!

491
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:26,812
Let's go home. Go.

492
00:37:29,116 --> 00:37:30,371
I have to find a safer place for you.

493
00:37:38,162 --> 00:37:40,297
A cat that hatches...

494
00:37:40,746 --> 00:37:43,027
Pure madness, Your Majesty!

495
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:45,956
Uncontrolled madness.

496
00:37:46,483 --> 00:37:47,417
Insanity.

497
00:37:48,716 --> 00:37:50,390
If the cats lost their wits,

498
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,555
it is great news for us.

499
00:37:53,274 --> 00:37:55,051
We give them a memorable lesson.

500
00:38:01,635 --> 00:38:03,635
What are you still doing here?

501
00:38:03,702 --> 00:38:06,539
- We...
- Go back and watch every his move!

502
00:38:07,164 --> 00:38:09,899
Fast, faster! Forward! March!

503
00:38:21,546 --> 00:38:24,001
Look what nice pack Zorba
brought for us!

504
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:25,989
Congratulations, kid!

505
00:38:26,089 --> 00:38:27,612
It's a really very nice chicken.

506
00:38:27,927 --> 00:38:29,927
Is horrible!

507
00:38:32,515 --> 00:38:34,484
Don't you think, he looks
a bit like Zorba?

508
00:38:35,057 --> 00:38:37,464
You have even the same eyes.
How much weighs little one?

509
00:38:37,978 --> 00:38:39,148
How do I know?
I'm not his mom!

510
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,716
Who are they, mom?

511
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:44,958
Mama! You heard, he called you "mama".

512
00:38:45,591 --> 00:38:47,876
How tender chick!

513
00:38:49,103 --> 00:38:50,715
They are my friends

514
00:38:50,915 --> 00:38:52,801
and I say you, that you will
stay here until'll be bigger.

515
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,521
As you wish, mom!

516
00:38:54,811 --> 00:38:56,050
"As you wish, mom!"

517
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:58,874
What is his name?

518
00:38:59,194 --> 00:39:00,158
Already... do not know.

519
00:39:00,698 --> 00:39:02,819
- I didn't think...
- You have to give him a name.

520
00:39:03,455 --> 00:39:05,655
But first we need to find
out if it's boy or girl.

521
00:39:07,226 --> 00:39:08,280
An letter "S".

522
00:39:18,986 --> 00:39:20,486
Spice... Spirala...

523
00:39:20,885 --> 00:39:21,937
Susan... Sex...

524
00:39:24,652 --> 00:39:28,617
Unfortunately encyclopedia doesn't say,
how to determine the sex of seagulls.

525
00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:30,685
Look at "seabirds".

525
00:39:30,925 --> 00:39:32,725
Nation of birds, birds of sea.

526
00:39:32,925 --> 00:39:36,651
Is needed to check a sea wolf
or better, a sea cat.

527
00:39:37,193 --> 00:39:39,567
Maybe someone specializes in
chickens, like Wind Rose.

528
00:39:39,814 --> 00:39:42,092
That's what I said, Wind Rose.

529
00:39:42,292 --> 00:39:44,292
When will you stop draw out
meowing from my mouth?

530
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,189
- Wind Rose!
- Welcome to the port, sailor!

531
00:39:49,675 --> 00:39:51,675
For thousand marinated anchovies!

532
00:39:51,854 --> 00:39:52,647
My friends!

533
00:39:52,747 --> 00:39:53,832
We must talk with you!

534
00:39:53,932 --> 00:39:55,871
Let me anchor. I go to you right away.

535
00:39:57,036 --> 00:39:59,229
Mom, I'm hungry!

536
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:01,428
What to do in such cases?

537
00:40:01,595 --> 00:40:04,432
Flies! Catch as many flies as you can!

538
00:40:05,132 --> 00:40:07,367
For a soul of all insane scomber!

539
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,765
The thing certain is serious!

540
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:14,620
Grow a seagull chick?

541
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,016
You've kinda messed up!

542
00:40:17,322 --> 00:40:19,794
But there is a solution:
take it back to Zorbas house,

543
00:40:19,953 --> 00:40:21,491
leave it to letting his owner to find it

544
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:23,288
and let she think about how to grow it.

545
00:40:23,978 --> 00:40:25,406
It seems very reasonable.

546
00:40:26,151 --> 00:40:27,093
It's true.

547
00:40:27,773 --> 00:40:29,700
- However...
- I don't know, it doesn't convince me.

548
00:40:30,285 --> 00:40:31,810
- And what do you say, Zorba?
- Me?

549
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:33,893
I believe that...

550
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:39,466
How good it is to be a cat!

551
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,735
Okay, I understand. Let me see.

552
00:40:50,241 --> 00:40:52,830
- So?
- So, for the wings of flying fish!

553
00:40:53,009 --> 00:40:54,581
It is a seagull femele. It is a girl.

554
00:40:54,681 --> 00:40:56,587
Congratulations, youngster.

555
00:40:57,283 --> 00:40:59,021
Is ugly. That chicken has a brain.

556
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,309
It's a horribly horrible girl.

557
00:41:01,469 --> 00:41:02,969
Yes, kid, it's true.

558
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:06,114
but one day this lady here
will lay so many eggs

559
00:41:06,335 --> 00:41:08,530
as many hairs on your
tail you have, slicker.

560
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,030
What a yucky!

561
00:41:10,881 --> 00:41:12,827
Okey, now we can give her a name.

562
00:41:13,317 --> 00:41:15,239
- "Horriblea".
- Small Ball!

563
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,864
What you say about "Snowball"?

564
00:41:17,373 --> 00:41:20,000
What a name! It's better with "Mizi".

565
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,173
Minu.

566
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,877
- Princess!
- Paniodina!

567
00:41:23,323 --> 00:41:25,211
Gosh, we even some fun!

568
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:28,162
We make a big mistake,
all these are names for cats.

569
00:41:28,388 --> 00:41:30,099
- Instead...
- I'm a cat!

570
00:41:33,101 --> 00:41:34,336
I found! I found!

571
00:41:35,149 --> 00:41:39,978
I thought, as the seagulls was
lucky to get under our protection,

572
00:41:40,842 --> 00:41:43,539
we might call her Lucky.

573
00:41:44,016 --> 00:41:45,540
I am ready to meow!

574
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,897
For the liver of hake, it's
a very beautiful name!

575
00:41:48,904 --> 00:41:51,552
Lucky, yes, it's a very
beautiful cat name!

576
00:41:51,855 --> 00:41:53,326
~ We are cats ~

577
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:57,498
~ We are we ~

578
00:42:00,815 --> 00:42:03,024
~ We are cats ~

579
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,478
~ How good to us! ~

580
00:42:10,854 --> 00:42:14,635
~ On the streets, we
happy, meeting our friends ~

581
00:42:15,577 --> 00:42:17,216
~ How are you? ~

582
00:42:17,851 --> 00:42:22,506
~ The problems, what we have on our heads ~

582
00:42:24,006 --> 00:42:26,006
~ Are disappearing here ~

583
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,500
~ On the street, all
together we feel so good ~

584
00:42:51,781 --> 00:42:54,085
~ I am a tomcat among tomcats ~

585
00:42:54,285 --> 00:42:57,132
~ I am proud and satisfied,
what more do you want? ~

586
00:43:00,126 --> 00:43:02,738
~ We are cats... ~

587
00:43:26,668 --> 00:43:29,068
~ With friends and with the mom ~

588
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,904
~ Everyone is calling me ~

589
00:43:31,999 --> 00:43:33,599
~ I am here! ~

590
00:43:34,007 --> 00:43:37,233
~ Everything is beautiful,
there's nothing bad ~

591
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:42,250
~ I want to do everything and always say "yes" ~

592
00:43:43,026 --> 00:43:48,088
~ We are cats, we are we ~

593
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:37,288
Good, Bubulina, I open for you.

594
00:44:43,387 --> 00:44:45,643
You will get out of here with
your meowing when I hit your head!

595
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:49,475
Dad, come, we must give
food that cats!

596
00:44:49,775 --> 00:44:51,480
Cats? What cats?

597
00:44:51,661 --> 00:44:52,661
Come on, let's go!

598
00:44:58,994 --> 00:45:03,748
- How is cat-chicken?
- Learns, Your Rattness.

599
00:45:03,948 --> 00:45:05,499
And grow?

600
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:09,214
Yes, Your Rattness, it becames rounder.

601
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,182
Excellent!

602
00:45:14,979 --> 00:45:18,347
Do not you think it's time
to move your plan to action, sir?

603
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:21,600
Yeah, sure.

604
00:45:22,868 --> 00:45:27,292
I want rats guarding
every corner of the city.

605
00:45:27,742 --> 00:45:30,327
Today we eat a good sausage of a chicken!

606
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:36,855
Good, isn't it?

607
00:45:36,955 --> 00:45:38,539
I think they was very hungry.

608
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:40,957
I would call the girl.

609
00:45:41,699 --> 00:45:43,711
- Fishes...
- Come on, Lucky.

610
00:45:44,385 --> 00:45:45,355
Come to eat.

611
00:45:48,243 --> 00:45:49,437
Look, dad.

612
00:45:49,437 --> 00:45:52,573
What bird is it? A pigeon?

613
00:45:52,993 --> 00:45:54,623
When they are so small, I do not know.

614
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,805
Surely however it sounds strange.

615
00:45:57,394 --> 00:45:59,366
Look here, little one. You like?

616
00:46:00,067 --> 00:46:01,186
Isn't that nice, dad?

617
00:46:01,724 --> 00:46:03,963
- Yes. Now we go home.
- Bye, kitties!

618
00:46:07,195 --> 00:46:09,651
Supercat arrives, strikes the right side,

619
00:46:10,035 --> 00:46:11,259
crushes all opponents...

620
00:46:11,932 --> 00:46:15,982
Fifi hits of the center,
from left, from center...

621
00:46:16,714 --> 00:46:18,526
Let me play too from time to time.

622
00:46:19,095 --> 00:46:19,860
It is mine!

623
00:46:20,363 --> 00:46:22,246
- It's not yours, it's mine!
- Yes, I have it!

624
00:46:22,669 --> 00:46:24,361
It's mine, I got it from Zorba!

625
00:46:33,317 --> 00:46:34,838
What is happening here?

626
00:46:35,088 --> 00:46:36,888
- She started!
- He did!

627
00:46:36,924 --> 00:46:38,394
I do not care who started!

628
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:43,449
With a bundle Lucky is playing. You
surprise me much with your behavior, son.

629
00:46:44,023 --> 00:46:44,969
You're older than her.

630
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:48,948
You argue with her for a bundle
when you're big enough to hunt rats?

631
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:01,427
Small Ball, if you want to play more, I...

632
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:03,714
I do not care about your stupid game!

633
00:47:04,252 --> 00:47:07,693
It's easy to be good, sister,
when the adults are crazy about you!

634
00:47:08,295 --> 00:47:10,373
- Small Ball, but I...
- You what, Horriblea?

635
00:47:10,919 --> 00:47:13,701
Do you know why Zorba and others spoil you?

636
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,162
- Because they love me?
- No!

637
00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:19,314
Because they want you to
be fat when they eat you!

638
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:21,651
It's not a true! They would never do that!

639
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:23,810
Of course yes, cats eat birds!

640
00:47:24,171 --> 00:47:25,544
But I am a cat!

641
00:47:25,726 --> 00:47:27,433
Yes, and where are your whiskers?

642
00:47:28,075 --> 00:47:29,159
And claws?

643
00:47:29,497 --> 00:47:31,654
And tail? You're not a cat!

644
00:47:31,917 --> 00:47:34,441
You are a bird just like them!

645
00:47:51,478 --> 00:47:52,566
I got him!

646
00:47:53,402 --> 00:47:55,318
...to do not forget all...

647
00:47:56,127 --> 00:47:58,892
- 6 times 7 equals 44.
- 42!

648
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:03,885
...forget all when rain

649
00:48:04,111 --> 00:48:06,076
falls in love with twilight.

650
00:48:06,257 --> 00:48:07,682
- 8 times 3... 24.
- Bravo!

651
00:48:09,907 --> 00:48:12,539
You know what, all cat of our
friends seem so stupid.

652
00:48:13,331 --> 00:48:14,828
They are thinking always about food,

653
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,704
how to split it between them.

654
00:48:18,704 --> 00:48:20,000
And I'm like that for you?

655
00:48:20,203 --> 00:48:21,034
Sometimes yes.

656
00:48:21,612 --> 00:48:22,776
And sometimes not.

657
00:48:23,956 --> 00:48:26,110
You are... different.

658
00:48:27,025 --> 00:48:29,135
In fact, you are different too.

659
00:48:30,067 --> 00:48:32,574
- You...
- Yes, I am different.

660
00:48:32,905 --> 00:48:36,534
because I was lucky to meet two people
who understand that every being

661
00:48:37,108 --> 00:48:38,844
has his soul, thoughts,

662
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:39,728
feelings...

663
00:48:40,312 --> 00:48:41,860
Exactly what I wanted to talk with you about.

664
00:48:42,384 --> 00:48:44,361
I have... many feelings.

665
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:45,685
Very many.

666
00:48:46,278 --> 00:48:48,193
But the most important... is that one,

667
00:48:48,737 --> 00:48:51,683
what I feel when I am close
to someone, who I...

668
00:48:52,115 --> 00:48:52,937
Who you...?

669
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:56,681
...who I... wish... wish so much...

671
00:49:01,212 --> 00:49:02,807
- Come quickly to the museum!
- Why?

672
00:49:02,954 --> 00:49:04,451
Something terrible happened!

673
00:49:04,762 --> 00:49:05,693
Lucky ran away!

674
00:49:08,015 --> 00:49:09,413
Who have seen her as last?

675
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:10,445
I have.

676
00:49:10,538 --> 00:49:12,422
She was arguing for a bundle with Small Ball.

677
00:49:12,898 --> 00:49:13,866
I finished it.

678
00:49:14,162 --> 00:49:15,939
Then the last one who seen her is Small Ball.

679
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:17,819
Small Ball, what happened?

680
00:49:18,774 --> 00:49:19,891
I... don't know...

681
00:49:20,686 --> 00:49:23,061
She was so... I didn't want...

682
00:49:23,668 --> 00:49:24,975
I really didn't want!

683
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,420
But I fell into anger.

684
00:49:28,684 --> 00:49:29,838
- And then...
- Then?

685
00:49:30,532 --> 00:49:33,013
I've said you want to eat her.

686
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:40,309
Go, we have to find her! Hurry!

687
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:55,428
~ I'm not a cat ~

688
00:49:57,269 --> 00:49:58,993
~ Who am I? ~

689
00:50:02,589 --> 00:50:05,345
~ I'm not a cat ~

690
00:50:06,345 --> 00:50:09,639
~ Who am I? ~

691
00:50:15,498 --> 00:50:19,172
~ Me, my mother and my friends
was the happiest cats ~

692
00:50:20,252 --> 00:50:21,837
~ From the street ~

693
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:25,504
~ But the celebration was ended ~

694
00:50:26,209 --> 00:50:29,990
~ And I was left with just a lie ~

695
00:50:31,496 --> 00:50:33,641
~ A lie ~

696
00:50:34,207 --> 00:50:35,855
~ I'm not a cat ~

697
00:50:37,855 --> 00:50:40,074
~ Who am I? ~

698
00:50:56,202 --> 00:50:57,846
~ I wished to that life ~

699
00:50:58,925 --> 00:51:03,007
~ Would never ended, just was my life! ~

700
00:51:04,571 --> 00:51:06,812
~ Was beautiful, was perfect ~

701
00:51:07,212 --> 00:51:11,119
~ But why did you tell me a lie? ~

702
00:51:11,882 --> 00:51:14,028
~ A lie ~

703
00:51:14,752 --> 00:51:16,522
~ I'm not a cat ~

704
00:51:19,216 --> 00:51:21,415
~ Who am I? ~

705
00:51:25,814 --> 00:51:27,749
~ I'm not a cat ~

706
00:51:30,124 --> 00:51:32,573
~ Who am I? ~

707
00:51:38,202 --> 00:51:40,647
Bravo, beautiful show!

708
00:51:41,299 --> 00:51:43,531
- Now come with us!
- No!

709
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:54,060
I do not know, really do not know!

710
00:51:54,117 --> 00:51:56,077
Curiosity killed the cat...

711
00:51:57,554 --> 00:51:59,300
An terrible thing!

712
00:51:59,819 --> 00:52:00,992
An awfuly terrible thing!

713
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,293
What is it, Small Ball?

714
00:52:03,393 --> 00:52:05,961
Let attack them directly in
the canal and destroy them!

715
00:52:06,521 --> 00:52:09,387
In due time. I respect your courage, but...

716
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:12,176
In this case we must act craftily.

717
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,871
Craftily military, strategy, tactics,

718
00:52:14,971 --> 00:52:17,075
ocular, diversion...

719
00:52:17,269 --> 00:52:18,835
Right, but how?

720
00:52:19,073 --> 00:52:21,749
Please, Secretary. I am just
trying to understand...

721
00:52:21,835 --> 00:52:23,606
- I found!
- What, Diderot?

722
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:24,307
The solution!

723
00:52:24,705 --> 00:52:26,574
The encyclopedia is suggesting
it, in the 13th volume,

724
00:52:27,182 --> 00:52:28,310
a letter "H" from "Homer".

725
00:52:28,768 --> 00:52:30,901
- What is that?
- A great poet of antiquity.

726
00:52:31,177 --> 00:52:33,788
In his work, "Iliad", is the
solution to our problem.

727
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:35,235
In other words?

728
00:52:35,651 --> 00:52:36,318
Look!

729
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:38,522
Not bad!

730
00:52:39,016 --> 00:52:40,319
Really not bad!

731
00:52:40,748 --> 00:52:42,857
I do not want to be pessimistic,
but there is few of us.

732
00:52:43,383 --> 00:52:47,862
This is a war, all cats in the
city will bring their contribution.

733
00:52:48,073 --> 00:52:49,405
Quickly, we have no time to lose!

734
00:52:55,668 --> 00:52:56,959
Come back here, cat thief!

735
00:53:12,252 --> 00:53:14,529
Why always me?

736
00:53:16,181 --> 00:53:17,886
Thank you, Bubulina, you're great!

737
00:53:18,315 --> 00:53:21,175
It's nothing, Diderot.
I just did my duty.

738
00:53:21,743 --> 00:53:23,802
If you will see him,
pass greetings to Zorba

739
00:53:25,279 --> 00:53:26,844
Next!

740
00:53:28,053 --> 00:53:29,056
Is not fair, grandpa!

741
00:53:29,156 --> 00:53:30,361
I want to come too!

742
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:31,639
Negative, my boy.

743
00:53:32,204 --> 00:53:36,013
That's the most dangerous action
that we, cats, ever tried!

744
00:53:36,113 --> 00:53:38,146
Females and kittens should stay home.

745
00:53:38,531 --> 00:53:41,566
I'm not kitten! I am big, even
you've said that I am big!

746
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:42,746
Enough! Orders are orders!

747
00:53:43,241 --> 00:53:44,857
You are bad! You are
bad and not fair!

748
00:53:45,921 --> 00:53:47,353
Calm down.

749
00:53:47,747 --> 00:53:49,115
Do you think he is big enough?

750
00:53:49,533 --> 00:53:50,798
Winds Rose does!

751
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:52,612
- When action takes place?
- Tonight!

752
00:53:53,283 --> 00:53:57,216
We will give a hard time those canal rats!

753
00:55:13,218 --> 00:55:15,338
~ We are rats ~

754
00:55:17,102 --> 00:55:19,977
~ No one, nobody ~

755
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:27,067
~ We circulate alone in the dark night ~

756
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:32,973
His Majesty, the Great Rat

757
00:55:33,447 --> 00:55:39,822
~ The moment, what we are
waiting for, will arrive ~

758
00:55:43,689 --> 00:55:50,202
~ Soon that entire city will be ours ~

759
00:55:53,144 --> 00:55:55,113
Subject rats of all canals

760
00:55:55,683 --> 00:55:58,254
For a long time our nation has grown in numbers

761
00:55:59,001 --> 00:56:02,134
in importance as well as in weight.

762
00:56:03,595 --> 00:56:06,653
Rats, see this chick?

763
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,042
It was raised by cats.

764
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:18,953
~ We hate cats, just a little longer
and they go away from here ~

765
00:56:19,441 --> 00:56:21,166
And this demonstrates that

766
00:56:21,703 --> 00:56:23,936
now the cats have lost their reason.

767
00:56:24,478 --> 00:56:28,851
~ We come out from canals ~

768
00:56:29,471 --> 00:56:31,370
~ On the top ~

769
00:56:34,672 --> 00:56:41,356
~ We will win and nothing's gonna stop us ~

770
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:49,605
~ The world is ours at last ~

771
00:56:55,011 --> 00:57:00,189
~ For us nothing is frightening ~

772
00:57:03,881 --> 00:57:06,191
But before we go outside,

773
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:09,890
Let's celebrate with scoffing juicy... chicken!

774
00:57:13,107 --> 00:57:15,217
No!

775
00:57:15,674 --> 00:57:18,110
Leave her alone!

776
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:23,662
Leave her right now!

777
00:57:24,164 --> 00:57:25,565
Keep away from her!

778
00:57:31,356 --> 00:57:32,670
Bring me here that grub!

779
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:34,915
Leave me!

780
00:57:35,055 --> 00:57:36,345
Small Ball!

781
00:57:36,545 --> 00:57:37,785
Shut up, chicken sausages!

782
00:57:37,885 --> 00:57:39,365
Be respectful with her, understand?

783
00:57:39,585 --> 00:57:41,355
She is a cat!

784
00:57:42,744 --> 00:57:44,532
And I'm Snow White!

785
00:57:47,674 --> 00:57:48,760
Kill him!

786
00:57:49,629 --> 00:57:52,263
Great Rat!

787
00:57:52,814 --> 00:57:54,764
Your Highness, historical news!

788
00:57:55,591 --> 00:57:57,105
Cats surrendered!

789
00:57:57,365 --> 00:57:58,771
As a sign of peace sent a gift!

790
00:57:59,153 --> 00:58:00,130
Pull on!

791
00:58:08,075 --> 00:58:09,987
Bring him here to taste it.

792
00:58:10,418 --> 00:58:14,198
Stuff your belly!

793
00:58:20,846 --> 00:58:22,128
Come out, rats!

794
00:58:22,428 --> 00:58:24,243
Today should be a great day,

795
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:26,812
but it's so big triumph

796
00:58:28,716 --> 00:58:31,019
that today it's a glorious day!

797
00:58:33,019 --> 00:58:38,941
A glorious day for us!

798
00:58:53,565 --> 00:58:56,974
What are you waiting for, herds of rabbits?

799
00:58:57,216 --> 00:58:59,061
Attack!

800
00:58:59,765 --> 00:59:02,948
Tomcat, I advise you to be
careful with these claws

801
00:59:03,562 --> 00:59:06,245
Better you watch out for your neck.

802
00:59:07,295 --> 00:59:09,000
Release my friends!

803
00:59:09,097 --> 00:59:10,436
- You can't.
- No?

804
00:59:11,809 --> 00:59:14,375
You can... Release the grub!

805
00:59:18,233 --> 00:59:21,637
Good. And the chick.

806
00:59:25,097 --> 00:59:26,141
Quickly, let's all get out of here!

807
00:59:31,736 --> 00:59:32,761
With strength ahead!

808
00:59:39,012 --> 00:59:40,754
Throw them out.

809
00:59:48,052 --> 00:59:50,617
How dare you spit on me?

810
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:32,516
Still thinking about what
Small Ball said to you, huh?

811
01:00:33,261 --> 01:00:34,111
Yes.

812
01:00:34,647 --> 01:00:35,737
And you're sad.

813
01:00:36,484 --> 01:00:39,330
You should know, that he said something true

814
01:00:39,825 --> 01:00:40,507
and something false.

815
01:00:41,253 --> 01:00:43,880
It's true that cats eat birds,
it's part of their nature.

816
01:00:44,634 --> 01:00:46,005
But we could never eat you,

817
01:00:46,693 --> 01:00:49,480
because we love you and
we love you ever so much more

818
01:00:49,999 --> 01:00:51,171
just because you're different than us.

819
01:00:52,407 --> 01:00:53,796
I don't want to be different from you.

820
01:00:54,415 --> 01:00:55,375
I want to be a cat!

821
01:00:55,939 --> 01:00:58,247
We are pleased and proud
that you want to be like us.

822
01:00:58,936 --> 01:01:02,212
But we are more proud since
you're a beautiful seagull.

823
01:01:02,943 --> 01:01:06,378
And someday you'll be able to fly
free in the sky just like your mom.

824
01:01:07,812 --> 01:01:10,196
Brawo, youngster copes with words.

825
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:12,797
- It's eminent cat.
- Talk like from a book.

826
01:01:13,659 --> 01:01:15,518
So you're not my real mom?

827
01:01:16,058 --> 01:01:16,796
Are you, Zorba?

828
01:01:17,431 --> 01:01:19,984
No, Lucky. Your mother was
a young and brave seagull.

829
01:01:20,754 --> 01:01:23,549
She was gracile, elegant, noble

830
01:01:24,089 --> 01:01:25,705
like all creatures who can fly.

831
01:01:26,762 --> 01:01:27,966
But I'm afraid to fly!

832
01:01:28,429 --> 01:01:30,132
You don't need to fear
of your natural instincts.

833
01:01:30,642 --> 01:01:33,259
I promise that when you will
be ready, I'll be close.

834
01:01:34,378 --> 01:01:35,265
I love you, Zorba.

835
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:36,726
I love you all.

836
01:01:41,508 --> 01:01:44,120
Movement of pressure points
A and B must be accelerated.

837
01:01:45,252 --> 01:01:46,985
Expand C node.

838
01:01:48,078 --> 01:01:49,829
Expand D node.

839
01:01:50,928 --> 01:01:52,221
Raising point E.

840
01:01:53,537 --> 01:01:55,037
Leveling point F.

841
01:01:56,311 --> 01:01:57,504
30 beats per minute.

842
01:01:58,723 --> 01:02:00,209
Points A and B raised to chest.

843
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:02,513
And departure...

844
01:02:09,505 --> 01:02:10,279
I fell.

845
01:02:10,878 --> 01:02:11,984
Never mind, Lucky, calm down.

846
01:02:12,482 --> 01:02:13,846
Nobody flies at first attempt.

847
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:15,819
Let's try again.

848
01:02:33,675 --> 01:02:36,389
I'm not good at anything!

849
01:02:37,473 --> 01:02:39,061
We reached 21 trial.

850
01:02:39,396 --> 01:02:41,102
I fail to understand!

851
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,261
I studied Leonardo Da Vinci's machine
until the smallest details.

852
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:46,219
I strictly kept instructions, but...

853
01:02:46,838 --> 01:02:47,935
Anyway done for now.

854
01:02:48,035 --> 01:02:50,389
If we continue to failures,
Lucky never gonna fly.

855
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:53,074
Why do not we try with a volunteer?

856
01:02:54,072 --> 01:02:54,884
Volunteer?

857
01:02:55,362 --> 01:02:57,042
How great is our Secretary!

858
01:02:57,537 --> 01:03:00,000
This is what I like, awake
heart and brave brain.

859
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:07,429
Help! But why all me?

860
01:03:10,194 --> 01:03:13,280
Obvious, cause you're the lightest,
most agile and more aerodynamic.

861
01:03:18,153 --> 01:03:19,248
Start

862
01:03:29,667 --> 01:03:31,967
I rise up!

863
01:03:32,087 --> 01:03:33,853
- Hang on, young one!
- Fly!

864
01:03:33,953 --> 01:03:36,723
I rise up!

865
01:03:46,668 --> 01:03:48,621
Compass went crazy.

866
01:03:48,814 --> 01:03:50,773
The waves were as tall as buildings.

867
01:03:50,997 --> 01:03:53,854
The storm had already lasted five long days

868
01:03:54,549 --> 01:03:58,283
and I didn't know if we was going
towards the ground or on the deep sea.

869
01:03:58,525 --> 01:03:59,927
So what did you do?

870
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,965
All crew began to cry and pray.

871
01:04:03,497 --> 01:04:08,873
But right then the steersman saw three seagulls.

872
01:04:12,251 --> 01:04:13,540
For barracuda teeth!

873
01:04:13,841 --> 01:04:15,620
Those seagulls were flying towards ground.

874
01:04:16,775 --> 01:04:19,039
Let's follow them and we are saved!

875
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:22,102
You mean seagulls flies
in the midst of the storm?

876
01:04:22,397 --> 01:04:27,228
For the scared crampfish! Birds are
the most robust in the universe!

877
01:04:27,428 --> 01:04:30,033
Cool... You are cool!

878
01:04:32,303 --> 01:04:36,262
- It seems she wants to fly.
- I know, we've tried in all ways.

879
01:04:36,371 --> 01:04:40,154
I exhausted all flying items, plane and wings.

880
01:04:40,417 --> 01:04:42,490
It is absolutely the first time,
when encyclopedia disappoints me.

881
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:44,843
Perhaps she lived with us too long

882
01:04:45,425 --> 01:04:46,814
and now she can't anymore...

883
01:04:47,195 --> 01:04:49,246
For the swordfish, not to say foolishness!

884
01:04:49,515 --> 01:04:51,269
It's a seagull and seagulls fly!

885
01:04:52,981 --> 01:04:55,959
I promised her mother that she's
gonna fly. And she is gonna fly.

886
01:04:58,775 --> 01:05:00,807
Let try make her fly from
a very, very high place.

887
01:05:02,051 --> 01:05:03,819
I found, from belfry!

888
01:05:04,978 --> 01:05:07,270
We need to get up there,
where are the bells.

889
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:09,354
No, youngster, it's not possible.

890
01:05:09,578 --> 01:05:12,791
It's closed, it's not possible
for us, cats, to reach up there.

891
01:05:13,273 --> 01:05:15,702
We must consult someone who
is not part of the animal world.

892
01:05:16,054 --> 01:05:19,406
- Who could that be?
- It would be... human beings.

893
01:05:20,088 --> 01:05:21,106
Excluded!

894
01:05:21,309 --> 01:05:25,153
Speaking people language
is absolutely forbidden!

895
01:05:25,293 --> 01:05:27,851
You have no idea, what would
people make with speaking cats.

896
01:05:28,233 --> 01:05:29,681
Would close immediately in a cage.

897
01:05:29,907 --> 01:05:32,462
Yes, and then do their stupid medical exams.

898
01:05:32,629 --> 01:05:33,685
Would put it in a zoo

899
01:05:34,134 --> 01:05:35,289
and use in circuses,

900
01:05:35,843 --> 01:05:38,323
for all to see and laugh at him.

901
01:05:38,995 --> 01:05:42,023
You're right. I am convinced that most people

902
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,537
are not yet able to accept the idea

903
01:05:44,946 --> 01:05:49,092
that different being can be intelligent
and, eventually, could be smarter than them.

904
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,745
And even if, assuming we want to miaow with man,

905
01:05:58,963 --> 01:06:02,241
- who do you think would...
- My captain is a good person.

906
01:06:02,651 --> 01:06:06,189
He's a sailor, he has nothing
to do with flight, with air.

907
01:06:06,433 --> 01:06:08,295
What about humans from fishing?

908
01:06:08,797 --> 01:06:10,700
Yeah, right, like that which gaves
the Secretary shoot in ass.

909
01:06:10,924 --> 01:06:13,968
No, he is absolutely unworthy of this mission.

910
01:06:14,574 --> 01:06:16,783
Could it be your human, Zorba?

911
01:06:17,127 --> 01:06:19,159
No, my heart suffers.

912
01:06:19,829 --> 01:06:21,380
But I can not talk to him.

913
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,151
I would lose my domestic human.

914
01:06:23,837 --> 01:06:26,848
In fact it would require
a truly superior human.

915
01:06:27,285 --> 01:06:30,640
Actually we need even more special one.

916
01:06:30,892 --> 01:06:34,081
Someone who understands that
all beings in the world

917
01:06:34,267 --> 01:06:36,568
have a soul, thoughts and feelings.

918
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:38,891
I know someone like that.

919
01:06:42,088 --> 01:06:43,995
I knew I do wrong if I let you go in.

920
01:06:45,104 --> 01:06:46,898
What do you want to do?

921
01:06:46,926 --> 01:06:49,664
Do not move, be quiet and watch.

922
01:06:49,829 --> 01:06:51,644
But Zorba, it's forbidden!

923
01:07:07,029 --> 01:07:08,958
- Ciao, Nina.
- Where did you put my friends?

924
01:07:10,275 --> 01:07:12,929
- How can you speak?
- Everything is possible in a dream.

925
01:07:13,454 --> 01:07:17,253
- Are you in a dream?
- Yes, but I want to talk about something real.

926
01:07:17,574 --> 01:07:21,000
There is a seagull who
needs to fly, but fails.

927
01:07:22,154 --> 01:07:25,253
- I will help him.
- Yes.

928
01:07:26,285 --> 01:07:29,305
When you wake up, you have to take
us to the highest building in town,

929
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:31,281
Belfry of St. Michael.

930
01:07:32,494 --> 01:07:35,179
Doors are locked up and
we do not know how to enter.

931
01:07:35,554 --> 01:07:37,127
Do not worry, sir cat.

932
01:07:37,588 --> 01:07:43,899
Dad occasionally go up there at night
to think, through a gate what is always open.

933
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,695
Thank you, Nina. See you later.

934
01:07:45,911 --> 01:07:47,011
Wait!

935
01:07:47,111 --> 01:07:48,213
What's your name?

936
01:07:51,647 --> 01:07:54,633
Zorba, is that you?

937
01:07:55,451 --> 01:07:60,473
Cat from a dream! Bubulina, you
understand what I say too?

938
01:08:02,043 --> 01:08:03,860
Just as I've always suspected.

939
01:08:04,595 --> 01:08:07,176
Come quickly, but carefully.
Do not wake up my dad.

940
01:08:23,919 --> 01:08:25,582
How big you have grown!

941
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:27,011
She is Nina.

942
01:08:28,038 --> 01:08:29,024
She wants to help you, Lucky.

943
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:31,187
Come here, little one!

944
01:08:31,421 --> 01:08:32,546
I am your friend.

945
01:08:45,823 --> 01:08:47,823
I am scared, mom.

946
01:08:48,535 --> 01:08:51,061
Lucky, I am not your mom.

947
01:08:53,792 --> 01:08:55,692
I am scared... dad.

948
01:08:56,524 --> 01:08:58,569
But you want to fly, don't you?

949
01:09:00,481 --> 01:09:01,245
Yes.

950
01:09:21,027 --> 01:09:23,345
Look, you can see a yard where you're born.

951
01:09:23,779 --> 01:09:25,051
And there is the Diderot's museum.

952
01:09:25,811 --> 01:09:27,186
I am so scared!

953
01:09:27,694 --> 01:09:28,926
Courage, seagull!

954
01:09:29,057 --> 01:09:32,009
I know you're scared, I haven't
a courage to look down.

955
01:09:32,261 --> 01:09:33,929
Don't forget that you have wings,

956
01:09:34,357 --> 01:09:36,408
and who has wings, isn't afraid of heights,

957
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:38,879
and any obstacle what he can meet.

958
01:09:39,099 --> 01:09:42,342
If you have wings, nothing can stop you.

959
01:09:42,669 --> 01:09:45,157
You can fly to up there, to the moon!

960
01:09:45,656 --> 01:09:48,175
Fly, little seagull, fly!

961
01:09:49,223 --> 01:09:51,283
Do it for us, cats. I have never flown!

962
01:09:51,763 --> 01:09:54,212
Be the first flying cat!

963
01:09:55,763 --> 01:09:57,043
I love you, Zorba!

964
01:09:57,571 --> 01:09:58,625
Me too, Lucky.

965
01:09:59,611 --> 01:10:01,586
- Courage!
- Fly!

966
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:04,376
Fly, little seagull!

967
01:10:28,025 --> 01:10:30,434
Majesty! Cat's daughter flies!

968
01:10:30,524 --> 01:10:32,524
What's the big deal?

969
01:10:32,942 --> 01:10:35,387
We, rats, fly thousands of centuries!

970
01:10:36,201 --> 01:10:38,811
Crazy idiot!

971
01:10:44,845 --> 01:10:48,662
~ My feet do not touch anymore ~

972
01:10:48,762 --> 01:10:53,149
~ I am flying in blue ~

973
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:57,521
~ It's strange and beautiful to look from here ~

974
01:10:58,243 --> 01:11:02,346
~ And see houses so much small ~

975
01:11:02,987 --> 01:11:06,904
~ The world is different from up here ~

976
01:11:08,109 --> 01:11:11,353
~ It has no barriers anymore ~

977
01:11:12,335 --> 01:11:15,763
~ And, all my friends ~

978
01:11:16,293 --> 01:11:21,033
~ I owe it to you ~

979
01:11:22,105 --> 01:11:23,533
I am FLYING!

980
01:11:23,883 --> 01:11:30,146
~ I am flying, I would never have believed ~

981
01:11:40,795 --> 01:11:43,262
- Goodbye, Zorba.
- Goodbye, Lucky.

982
01:11:43,422 --> 01:11:44,354
~ Look at me! ~

983
01:11:44,922 --> 01:11:46,954
Bye, sister!

984
01:11:47,164 --> 01:11:53,715
~ Look at me, it seems a play to fly so ~

985
01:11:56,213 --> 01:12:01,663
~ Look at me, it seems a play ~

985
01:12:02,547 --> 01:12:10,707
~ Now I know where is my place,
and the sky is my place ~

986
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:20,022
~ And these wings, I feel
it now, are my freedom ~

987
01:12:20,751 --> 01:12:25,044
~ Distant sky, blue ocean ~

988
01:12:25,518 --> 01:12:30,012
~ Are already calling me ~

989
01:12:30,366 --> 01:12:39,398
~ That's my life and now
I am getting to know my destiny ~

990
01:12:40,954 --> 01:12:47,716
~ I am flying, I would never have believed ~

991
01:12:49,862 --> 01:12:56,997
~ I am flying, I would never have hoped ~

992
01:12:59,255 --> 01:13:03,855
~ I am flying ~

993
01:13:08,055 --> 01:13:10,455
~ Look at me! ~

994
01:13:13,669 --> 01:13:20,931
~ Look at me, it seems a play to fly so ~
