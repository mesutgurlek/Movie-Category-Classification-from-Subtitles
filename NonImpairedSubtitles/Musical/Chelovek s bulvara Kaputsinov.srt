Your road is long...

Written by Eduard Akopov

00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,080
It is long and empty...

Directed by Alla Surikova

00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,320
All that distance is not
For those weak of heart...

Andrey Mironov, Mikhail Boyarsky

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,280
Oh prairie, oh prairie,
The distance is great,

13
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,880
The Indian feathers,
The steel of the Brits.

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,360
The price is absurd,
But the payment is hard.

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,720
The principal thing
Is to keep my hat on.

16
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,520
But I value in some sense

17
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,880
The thing that is kept in my
hat.

18
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,320
That's how it goes!

19
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,320
You ride fast, you die young,

20
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,480
You ride slow, you never come.

21
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,560
So live and don't chicken out.

22
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,240
Let it all go it's way,

23
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,120
And you'll get what happens
next.

24
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,280
- The Black Jack Gang!
- You'll get it, Jack!

25
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,560
Go, move it!

26
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,400
Why don't you shoot, God damn
you?

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,720
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes, you!

28
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,080
- I don't have a weapon.
- Did you come here without one?

29
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,960
- I didn't come to kill.
- Then you'll get killed.

30
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,520
I don't get it, how can you read
in such a minute?

31
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,320
Aren't you scared?

32
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,840
What one has a purpose in life,

33
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,360
one is not afraid of death.

34
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,360
You weren't expected, sir.

35
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,440
Sammy, don't you want to greet
me?

36
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,200
I greeted you the last time
around.

37
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,960
Go!

38
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,720
Let's say good-bye then.

39
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,840
Well, Jack...

40
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,160
Don't worry, ma'am. I'll just
have a look.

41
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,080
Oh, such a leg...

42
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,120
What a leg!

43
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
10 to 1, sir,

44
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,480
you're clutching your Bible with
both hands.

45
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,000
For me, it's rather the Holy
Writ.

46
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,680
- Preparing for a better life?
- I wish you the same.

47
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,200
I'm not in a hurry and I don't
hurry you.

48
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,280
Careful, this is the world
history of cinema.

49
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,160
- He doesn't seem to see well.
- But I can hear well.

50
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,560
I have to admit, grammar isn't
my element,

51
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,120
but even I can discern that some
pages are empty.

52
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,440
It's the place for history, sir.

53
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,800
Dare it, and your name might be
written there.

54
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,480
- They wait for their heroes.
- You say funny things, sir.

55
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,800
I wish I could listen to you
some other time.

56
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,680
When I sent my 1st dozen to hell,

57
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,480
my mommy told me, "Jack, if

58
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,640
you're guilty of something, it's

59
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,680
only that you haven't met a good
man in life".

60
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,520
Sign it here. You took 50 grand
from us.

61
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,840
It was 40, Andy.

62
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,720
I can count, you know.

63
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,200
No insurance company would trust
my receipt.

64
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,440
Only if you don't negotiate it
with its president first.

65
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,320
Money loves everyone.

66
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,400
Remember it, gentlemen,

67
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,400
this country will be ruined by
the corruption.

68
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,400
Have a good day, sir.

69
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,640
Who knows, our paths might still
cross.

70
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,600
I'd be glad if they do.

71
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,520
- Our mommy has come!
- Oh my little birdies!

72
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,240
Mommy's here!

73
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,520
Why did you marry me?

74
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,080
I didn't know you were this
dumb!

75
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,000
You did!

76
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,880
You did!

77
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,600
No way!

78
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,840
How do you do. My friend, could
you tell me

79
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,480
where I could get...

80
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,520
You couldn't...

81
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,840
Mister, ask at the drugstore,
they might have it.

82
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,800
Mrs. Parker, you should be
confined to bed.

83
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,280
Yes!

84
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,000
Mrs. Parker! Don't forget it,

85
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,440
10 drops before you shoot.
Before it, not after!

86
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,920
- Yes.
- No, did you get it?

87
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,880
Screw off...

88
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,880
Did you say something?

89
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,520
So you don't have anything to
tell me?

90
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,360
A real man always has something
to say,

91
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,040
is he's a real man, of course.

92
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,480
Mr. King, your steak.

93
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,000
Sir, it was my steak.

94
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,560
That's right, it was yours.

95
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,360
Harry, put $10 on my account.

96
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,320
Looks like the entire 30.

97
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,680
Fly!

98
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
Your health!

99
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,320
Shall we relax?

100
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,560
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

101
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,720
I didn't invite you.

102
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,880
Hi there.

103
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,880
That's friends, Peppy!

104
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,520
Careful there.

105
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,240
Sorry.

106
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
Harry, put $4 on his account!

107
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,640
$4!

108
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,360
Fly!

109
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,560
- Billy, I'm standing here.
- You'll lie down now.

110
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,000
Harry, I owe you $11!

111
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,360
Rowdy-dowdy... $12!

112
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,680
Excuse me, for Gods sake.

113
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,080
I'd like to have a drink with
you.

114
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,200
- I'd like a drink.
- I'm busy.

115
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,120
You refused. Too bad.

116
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,400
Fly!

117
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,400
It's serious, Billy, it's 80.

118
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,480
- Yesterday it cost 50.
- What about an inflation?

119
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,360
Gentlemen, I pass.

120
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,600
Hello!

121
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,920
Hi!

122
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,720
I'd like a drink.

123
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,760
- Harry, what's my count?
- 180, Billy!

124
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,720
Let's make it even. Fly away.

125
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,520
- A beauty.
- Sorry.

126
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,000
1, 2, 3...

127
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,600
4...

128
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,120
5, 6.

129
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,840
OK, guys, that's enough!

130
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,600
Time to clean up a bit.

131
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,840
You heard it, man.

132
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,720
The end!

133
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,520
The time has come,

134
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,280
And here we are!

135
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,760
Here we are, your babies!

136
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,600
That's it, enough scratching
your heads,

137
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,760
Enough sucking on bottles,

138
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,240
You'd better clap your hands!

139
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,640
A soldier is loved for his
dough,

140
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,080
An officer is loved for his
uniform,

141
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,600
But I love the cowboy

142
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,120
Because he's the only one!

143
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,600
A cowboy,

144
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,160
the hero of the magic dreams,

145
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,720
You excite me, I admit it,

146
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,560
Cowboy, a couple of tender words

147
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,160
You find for me and I'll go with
you.

148
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,840
Your steak, sir.

149
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,560
In the rattle of the day,
In the quiet of the night

150
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,000
I'll hear the words of love.

151
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,960
It's cold.

152
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,840
You only say it,

153
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,840
And I shall hear it.

154
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,080
Sir, it was my steak.

155
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,480
'Scuse me.

156
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,600
Where?

157
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,800
Sir...

158
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,560
- Harry, I owe you $100.
- Sorry, no credit.

159
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,800
I could lend it, if you don't
mind.

160
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,200
Please.

161
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,520
Your steak, sir.

162
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,800
Sorry.

163
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,720
An actor is loved for his art,

164
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,440
A player is loved for his music,

165
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,760
But why I love the cowboy,

166
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,320
I'll tell only to him!

167
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,680
I like you, man.

168
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,280
- Billy.
- Johnny.

169
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,760
Cowboy, you're a swell guy,

170
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,120
You've been exciting me for
years,

171
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,440
Cowboy, you're brave but the
problem is,

172
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,240
You can't put 2 words together.

173
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,960
Just for me, find them and put
them together,

174
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,040
I'll always hear you,

175
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,640
Just say it,

176
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,440
Say it, I'll hear you,

177
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,040
Tell me, I'll hear you,

178
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,040
I'll hear you.

179
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,840
Raise your leg higher, it'll be
a success,

180
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,040
The legs should be clearly seen,

181
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,960
If a cowboy orders it, who's
gonna refuse?

182
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
Guys, we are your babes!

183
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,080
A sailor is loved for his
courage, a captain for his wine,

184
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,320
But why do I love my cowboy?

185
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,200
'Cause he has everything...

186
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,360
'Cause he has everything...

187
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,760
'Cause he has everything...

188
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,400
'Cause he has everything there.

189
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,640
I love her.

190
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,120
Friend, this is hopeless.

191
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,040
Ms. Little's heart is
impregnable like Ft. Knox.

192
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,680
Ft. Knox is the national
treasury.

193
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,600
You'd better have a drink.

194
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,920
A drink of water if I could.

195
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,960
Water...

196
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,480
- Water.
- C'mere, my pin.

197
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,440
Never drink this piss.

198
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,880
If you're used to it, your life

199
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,680
won't be worth a brass fart.

200
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
We're relaxing, Johnny.

201
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,240
But a soul wants something
grander.

202
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,640
Billy!

203
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,200
Something light and huge.

204
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,120
What did you say?

205
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,760
Light and huge?

206
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,040
That's why I'm here.

207
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,840
D'you have a white bed-sheet?

208
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,480
No, you missed my point.

209
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,160
Sorry.

210
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,280
Who has a white sheet?

211
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,760
Billy, I think your friend here
tries to offend us.

212
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,520
Gentlemen...

213
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,760
I have a white sheet.

214
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,240
I even have 2 white sheets.

215
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,880
And both of them are yours.

216
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,280
I think Ft. Knox throws a white
sheet.

217
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,840
Over there, in the coach,
there's my equipment.

218
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,240
If it's not too hard for you,

219
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,000
could you do me a favor and

220
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,880
just send someone to...

221
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,440
Are you deaf? On the double!

222
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,800
Thank you.

223
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,320
Please take your seats.

224
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,880
Billy, I think 2 offences a day
are too much.

225
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,680
It's not just this thing was
hung on the wall,

226
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,760
we're made to look at it!

227
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,800
Gentlemen, could you really
think...

228
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,440
Mr. First, I'm at your service.

229
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,120
Just a sec.

230
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,120
Here you are.

231
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,560
I could never hurt your
feelings.

232
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,760
Careful with this.

233
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,920
I'd like to suggest a different
spectacle.

234
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,440
Go on, man!

235
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,240
I'm on my saddle already.

236
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,480
How could I kill the light?

237
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,320
Godspeed!

238
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,040
Attention!

239
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,280
You're witnessing the arrival of
the train...

240
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,480
Looks like it won't stop at this
station.

241
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,680
...to the St. Lazar Station in
Paris.

242
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,200
Enough shooting! What are you
doing?

243
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,040
Where are you running? My
friends, it's not scary.

244
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,680
It's not scary at all, Diana,
not in the least.

245
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,800
There has never been anything
scary for me in the world.

246
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,760
But you succeeded in it.

247
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,040
I won't grudge you my only eye

248
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,280
to have that feeling again.

249
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,280
Thank you.

250
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,160
Mr. First, your invention is a
miracle.

251
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,280
Guys made a sieve out of my
walls,

252
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,960
so the repairs could cost $100.

253
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,760
The cinema isn't my invention, I
just serve it.

254
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,600
May I drop dead if that thing

255
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,680
doesn't clear the head better
than whiskey.

256
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,840
Gentlemen,

257
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,600
could anyone reproach me for

258
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,760
not paying for my whiskey?

259
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,840
- No one could.
- Pay then.

260
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,440
Mr. First, I'm yours!

261
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,840
- Here, Harry.
- Thank you...

262
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,320
...for trusting me. Thank you
again. To continue.

263
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,280
Maestro, something easy.

264
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
The screen should be replaced
though.

265
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,440
- Ms. Diana!
- Already.

266
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,080
Gentlemen, have I missed the
train?

267
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,240
- Look.
- Stepped on it!

268
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,360
Have you seen him twisting his
hose?

269
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,480
Johnny is a swell guy!

270
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,680
I think, gentlemen, it was a...

271
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,040
Comedy.

272
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,320
I'm sure, you realize, that
rapture

273
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,040
is the best when it's converted
into gold.

274
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,640
I think 30% would be fine, huh?

275
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,080
I realize, this figure is an
offence for a man of business.

276
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,600
What would you say about 40%?

277
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,720
OK, 50.

278
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,080
- This is a robbery!
- I don't need anything.

279
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,560
When I see a man who doesn't
need anything,

280
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,080
I realize he'll take all of it!

281
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,200
I misjudged you, you're a hard
nut to crack.

282
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,640
What would be your conditions?

283
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,840
Sir, turn around.

284
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,480
Have a look around.

285
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,120
Around, sir.

286
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,520
You'll see the world

287
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,480
that is imperfect.

288
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,960
The country lost.

289
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,640
Blood, sin and avarice

290
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,120
set us apart.

291
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,800
We've been driven to the edge,

292
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,160
with only the abyss and eternal
dark beyond it.

293
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,840
But there is a way out.

294
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,000
Yes, I saw it.

295
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,480
That unforgettable night when

296
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,840
I found myself at the Boulevard des
Capucines in the Lumiere theater.

297
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,880
The cinematograph!

298
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,640
That's the Messiah that could
change everything.

299
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,440
It will make us purer and
better.

300
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,600
For that...

301
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,160
I can sacrifice everything.

302
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,040
Even my own life.

303
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,440
So you'll excuse me but any

304
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,040
mention of the money seems

305
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,640
sacrilegious to me.

306
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,560
The only thing I could allow is

307
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:06,280
selling admission tickets for
the lowest possible price,

308
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,240
in order to guarantee the supply
of new pictures.

309
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,320
I'm getting older.

310
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,960
To misjudge one man twice.

311
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,040
It had never happened before.

312
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,600
Make a decision! You have the

313
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,200
future of the cinema in your
hands.

314
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,040
OK, Mr. First, we're agreed.

315
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,360
You can roll your films. I won't
charge you.

316
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,120
Thank you, Mr. McCue.

317
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,280
You're a generous person.

318
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,400
Raise your legs higher, and
it'll be a success,

319
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,640
Only the legs should be seen,

320
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,400
If the cowboy orders it, who
could refuse him?

321
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,720
Billy, I've arranged everything!

322
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,600
A sailor is loved for his
courage, a captain for his wine,

323
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,600
But why I love my cowboy?

324
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,480
'Cause he has everything,

325
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,040
'Cause he has everything,

326
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,440
'Cause he has everything there.

327
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,680
Yes, I'm on time.

328
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,640
The water's disappeared. Where's
the water?

329
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,080
I'll give it to you. Let me go.

330
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,720
>From now on and forever,

331
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,680
Right now, in any weather,

332
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,360
Right here, and everywhere,

333
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,880
We'll live in a different way!

334
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,200
With no anger or sadness,

335
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,520
For the good of the earth,

336
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,960
We've long dreamt about it,

337
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,480
But could never do it.

338
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,800
Cinema, cinema, cinema,

339
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,200
We're crazy about you!

340
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,000
Yes, I see you're glad,

341
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,680
But afraid to be disappointed,

342
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,640
'Cause you've been duped many
times before.

343
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,080
You don't need dreamers,
Yes, sure, of course,

344
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,400
But I'm not a dreamer,
And I know how...

345
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,360
>From now on and forever,

346
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,760
Right now, in any weather,

347
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,800
Right here, and everywhere,

348
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,400
We'll liver in a different way!

349
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,560
With no anger or sadness,

350
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,920
For the good of the earth,

351
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,040
We've long dreamt about it,

352
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,400
But could never do it.

353
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,720
With no anger or sadness,

354
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,000
For the good of the earth,

355
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,480
We've long dreamt about it,

356
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,840
But could never do it!

357
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,160
Cinema, cinema, cinema,

358
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,080
We're crazy about you!

359
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,440
One more time!

360
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,200
Good morning!

361
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,120
It's good for some, and it's the
last for others, sir.

362
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,680
I'd like to order something from
you

363
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,040
that looks like a big box.

364
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,160
It's called a coffin.

365
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,480
I'd rather call it a cradle for
new life.

366
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,920
Are you a philosopher? What was
your school?

367
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,680
Harvard? Some Washington courses?

368
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,200
What an I saying? Where do they
train philosophers nowadays?

369
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,680
Have you graduated?

370
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,400
Alas, a naive youth came here
with his grand ideas.

371
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,480
To transform the world, to save
the country.

372
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,240
Where are his ideas now?

373
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,360
Let's get back to business,
though. Do you know the size?

374
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,000
Yes, sure.

375
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,000
I'd like you to make

376
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,480
a small window in the center.

377
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,600
It could be fun to look up from
the netherworld.

378
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,400
And the door on the other side,

379
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:06,280
to enter and exit at will.

380
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,280
It's my first time, when a corpse

381
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,720
is prepared to this active
afterlife.

382
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,320
- Here's the size.
- Where should I deliver?

383
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,400
Harry's Saloon.

384
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,840
The deposit.

385
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,760
I won't hurry you up.

386
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,200
I'm interested in the quality.

387
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,160
Hello, baby!

388
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,160
- Oh how cute we are!
- I like him too.

389
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,320
- Piss off, holy father!
- You'll regret it, daughter.

390
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,920
- Good morning, minister.
- Good morning, my son.

391
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,120
I'm sorry, I thought Ms.
Little lives here.

392
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,760
'Scuse me, Mr. First, I didn't
think it might be you.

393
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,200
Could this charming girl have...

394
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,440
...have any enemies?

395
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,960
I wish they were!

396
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,600
They're a god-damned admirers!

397
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,560
Come in, Mr. First.

398
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,320
If you only knew how hard it is
to remain a decent girl.

399
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,000
Especially if the girl...

400
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,040
is beautiful as you are.

401
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,520
Flowers? For me?

402
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,520
God damn it all!

403
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,240
Ms. Diana, what's wrong?

404
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,160
Oh Johnny, you're the first man
in my life

405
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,360
who ever brought me flowers.

406
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,400
Now my heart is forever yours.

407
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,400
The end. Farewell, my love.
The destiny separates us,

408
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,320
but you'll live forever in my
heart.

409
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
God damn it!

410
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,120
Some people have all the luck!

411
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,040
They fall in love.

412
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,680
They go to theaters.

413
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,520
- To lie...
- Don't, Billy.

414
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,800
To libraries.

415
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,320
And how they behave: excuse me,
please...

416
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,640
What about you, Hugh?

417
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,280
Have you ever said please in your
life?

418
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,000
Oh would you shut up for
Chrissakes? I'm sick as it is.

419
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,520
That gentleman would say,

420
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,320
"Hugh, shut up, please".

421
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,920
Gentlemen!

422
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,160
It's not a secret for anyone

423
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,640
that all of you declared your
love to me one time or another.

424
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,520
I don't mention words you used.

425
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,480
But could any one of you,

426
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,000
just once,

427
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,560
drop on your knees in front of
me?

428
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,640
You're right, baby.

429
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,000
Personally, I could

430
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,120
only manage

431
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,200
to slap your bottom.

432
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,880
What could be said here...

433
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,720
We're all shit and we swim in
shit.

434
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,120
It seems to me, Billy King, that

435
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,600
you're trying to offend me.

436
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,600
Tale my Colt, Martin, and

437
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,560
shoot me if I'm wrong.

438
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,760
I just think that "shit" is the
wrong word

439
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,760
to be used in a decent company,
and...

440
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,320
I second that.

441
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,600
Excuse me, gentlemen. Please.

442
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,040
Harry, what's wrong with you?

443
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,080
Farewell, my love...

444
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,680
The fate separates us...

445
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,720
But you'll live forever in my
heart... I can't...

446
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,840
That's art for you! This is
something to live for.

447
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,120
Such things make you want to
accomplish a lot.

448
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,440
I can't understand what's wrong
with me,

449
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,600
Everything's like a dream and a
reality,

450
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,680
And my heart beats in a new way,

451
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,040
Like I live afresh.

452
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,040
A magic ray

453
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,160
In the pitch darkness,

454
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,320
Thank you, oh thank you.

455
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,040
You're like a key

456
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,280
To my prison.

457
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,200
Thank you, oh thank you.

458
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,160
My pure ray, you illuminate my
way,

459
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,040
You're not hot, but I'm ablaze,

460
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,240
You light up the dark, and thank
you for that,

461
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,920
Oh thank you!

462
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,800
Mr. First, here's your ordered
item.

463
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,920
- The size is yours.
- I'm much obliged.

464
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,320
Have a nice day.

465
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,160
Mr. Danly, we haven't seen you
for ages.

466
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,320
You sure have had a lot of
changes. How interesting!

467
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,320
- Later.
- Should we deal a hand?

468
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,560
- I'd like to talk to you.
- I don't have time.

469
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,600
Harry, I'm dying of thirst.

470
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,560
I haven't seen you for ages,
Danly. Please.

471
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,640
What is it?

472
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,560
Water.

473
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,600
What?

474
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,480
You said you were dying of thirst
and I gave you water.

475
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,400
You stinking skunk!

476
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,560
I've spent the whole month at my
rancho

477
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,400
without a drop of whiskey,
and you give me water.

478
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,520
You cheap bastard. You coyote and
the coyote's son!

479
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,480
And you...

480
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,520
Danly, did you ask me for water
or...

481
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,160
Whiskey, god damn it!

482
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,920
Have I ever asked you anything
different?

483
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,080
Come on, Danly!

484
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,400
Gentlemen, my horse was the first

485
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,000
in line in the morning.
I was next to Billy.

486
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,240
Bollocks, Hubert, I was next to
Billy.

487
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,760
Martin was next to me, and we
haven't seen you here at all.

488
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,920
Gentlemen, queue up for the
admittance.

489
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,680
Please.

490
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,960
I need it badly!

491
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,280
Easy now!

492
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,240
Upon my honor, I'm broke.

493
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,840
I cry twice a day.

494
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,600
The first time, at night when I
watch the film,

495
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,040
then in the morning when I count
the losses.

496
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,960
- Mister, where should I put it?
- As usual.

497
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,400
- Hi there, Danly.
- What have you brought?

498
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,680
Could I have a free ticket,
mister?

499
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,360
You see, Danly, the dollar is
devalued.

500
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,360
Harry, have it really come to the
fact

501
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,640
that the lads drink this cow
slop?

502
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,840
Mr. Parker, please.

503
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,120
My Peggy says, if I come home

504
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,400
no black eyes, it means
I was with the girls,

505
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,800
and not in the saloon. She
doesn't give me money.

506
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,400
- No.
- Mr. Bobby, one last time.

507
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,160
Mr. Thompson, I've been letting
you in free for 2 weeks.

508
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,720
Clear the path.

509
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,080
OK then. Then I'll shoot you.

510
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,840
Shoot, but I'll be replaced by
someone else.

511
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,280
How do you do.

512
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,120
Sorry for bothering you,
gentlemen, but let me through.

513
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,680
Please, be so kind.

514
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,760
The third shot!

515
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,880
Mr. Johnson, don't be late.

516
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,080
Here, stick it, the bloodsucker.

517
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,800
Please, sir.

518
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:21,040
Your habit of entering after
the 3rd shot is irritating.

519
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,720
Martin...

520
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,640
Give me a black eye, if you
could.

521
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,840
Please, I really need it.

522
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,440
This is for my old woman.

523
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,760
You must be crazy. Thompson,

524
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,360
how could I hit a man? Who do you
think I am?

525
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,760
But I love my cowboy,

526
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,800
because he has...

527
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,800
Because I have...

528
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,960
I have everything!

529
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,480
So screw your cinematography!

530
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,040
They drink milk.

531
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,040
I'll have some rest.

532
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,600
Wait!

533
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,160
We used to dance for temptation,

534
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,840
And raised our legs without
shame,

535
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,480
Now we dance a lot more modestly,

536
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,360
And we are moved by beauty.

537
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,840
A magic ray

538
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,080
In the pitch darkness,

539
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,040
Thank you, oh thank you.

540
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,720
You're like a key
To my prison,

541
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,480
Thank you, oh thank you.

542
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,600
My pure light, you illuminate my
way,

543
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,200
You're not hot, but I'm all
aflame,

544
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,880
You light up my darkness, and
thank you for that,

545
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,320
Oh thank you.

546
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,160
What a beautiful hand.

547
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,640
It looks like it was created to
turn the projector's handle.

548
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,920
Your cinematograph is the whole
world.

549
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,160
You've opened a wonderful magic
window for me...

550
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,520
Which I will close.

551
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,880
Father, the cinema is

552
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,080
the cure for the sick.

553
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,720
And the opium for the people.

554
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,680
Please stop it.

555
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,560
That's why I...

556
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,440
Love my cowboy...

557
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Did you say anything?

558
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,600
Does it mean you have nothing to
say?

559
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,600
A real man always have something
to say.

560
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,440
If he is a real man.

561
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,320
- Your steak, Mr. King.
- Thank you, sir.

562
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,800
Where is it? Here it is!

563
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,560
Here it is! Your steak, Mr. King!

564
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,840
- Harry!
- Yes, Billy?

565
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,800
Well I...

566
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,240
Thanks for your reminding me,

567
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,200
sir, that it was my steak.

568
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,560
- Did you want to say something?
- I wanted to say...

569
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,840
Harry, that it's time to serve
forks for dinner.

570
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,480
A gentleman shouldn't eat with a
knife only.

571
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,000
I'm sorry, sir, but I should

572
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,520
remind you that you're in a place

573
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,440
where films are shown.

574
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,200
We don't allow drinking liquor
here,

575
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,640
and carry it with you.

576
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,160
Go to hell with your film!

577
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,760
This shitty cinema of yours has

578
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,040
turned us into cowardly mules.

579
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,360
Did I hear you correctly? You
said "shitty cinema"?

580
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,840
Yes, shitty cinema and cowardly
mules.

581
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,480
I can forgive you mules, but only
them.

582
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,200
Could you be so kind as to do me
a favor?

583
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,120
At last!

584
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,200
Not here.

585
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,320
I wouldn't like to desecrate
this place.

586
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,760
He didn't like cinema.

587
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:16,480
I'm poisoned by the cinema.

588
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,240
The films substituted everything
for me.

589
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,240
I feel they're more valuable
than money to me.

590
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,280
Please advise me, father. I'm
torn in two.

591
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,080
My son, listen to the voice of
your heart.

592
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,640
For Lord speaks to you through
it.

593
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,800
My father,

5931
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,480
I'll be broke then.

594
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,280
My son.

595
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,360
Listen top your reason, for Lord
gave it to you,

596
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,480
so that you could listen to it.

597
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,800
Should I get rid of First?
What about the cinema?

598
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,480
Won't I see it again?

599
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,320
Do you really think that Lord
could

600
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,040
tolerate your indecision
for your meager $10?

601
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,840
Here's a good fiance for you.

602
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,520
- But he's old.
- You're not going to boil him.

603
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,880
Johnny, I want us to have a
baby.

604
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,560
Today, right now.

605
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,960
Now? It's impossible, my dear.
There's time

606
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,120
for everything. We should
get married first.

607
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,760
You deceive me. Don't you want
to have a baby?

608
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,920
People kiss in your films, and

609
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,720
the next minute they have a
baby.

610
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,760
We've surely kissed a lot.

611
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,760
Diana, how should I put it?

612
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,600
It's called editing.

613
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,800
First, people kiss.

614
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,200
Then some time passes, a month
or a year.

615
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,320
Then they get married. Some more
time passes,

616
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,520
and they have a baby.

617
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,200
In cinema all this is edited
out.

618
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,760
A kiss...

619
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,840
A marriage...

620
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,640
And a baby.

621
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,520
Johnny, I want it like in the
cinema.

622
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,480
Please edit it.

623
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,240
- Diana...
- Johnny...

624
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,760
The Comanches!

625
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,160
That's him.

626
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,080
Where's Diana?

627
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,480
First! Comanches!

628
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,880
Stuffy! Take it!

629
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,200
Johnson, follow me. Harry, take
the machine-gun to the attic!

630
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,960
- Take Diana upstairs.
- I'm going with you.

631
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,880
You take care for the device!

6311
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,800
Comanches are at the path of
war!

632
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,760
To work, gentlemen!

633
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,240
I'll die for First happily!

634
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,200
Peppy, we're going to see things

635
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,680
we'd better never see.

636
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,040
Let's get to work, gentlemen!

637
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,880
Farewell, love!

638
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,440
The destiny...

639
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,520
separates us.

640
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,320
Do it, Harry.

641
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,120
That damn woman! We're done with
now.

642
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,600
Hugh, how can you refer to a
lady like this?

643
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,680
I'm gonna slap her out.

644
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:37,040
My hand won't touch a woman.

645
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,080
Gentlemen, I pass!

646
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,880
I'm out of ammo!

647
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,000
- Me, too!
- Stuffy!

648
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,320
There's none... that's it!

649
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,920
I don't see a woman among you.

650
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,520
A pale-faced one.

651
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,960
With her hair like a morning
dawn.

652
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,560
- We didn't have a woman.
- Lies don't become a warrior.

653
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,600
I wish I could have a single
cartridge.

654
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,880
I wouldn't miss that painted ape.

655
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,480
I forgive the pale-faced one

656
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,960
his words.

657
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,400
He may have never heard of Sir
Charles Darwin and he

658
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,480
may not be aware that an ape

659
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,120
is our common ancestor.

660
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,440
Are you sitting in this booth?

661
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,880
Oh my chief, it is she!

662
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,120
I saw her the last moon.

663
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,560
If he lays a finger on her, I'll
tear his throat out.

664
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,520
I'll take part, too.

665
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,080
2 tickets to the afternoon
performance.

666
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,440
For me...

667
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,560
and for my squaw.

668
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,400
You killed First and now mock
us!

669
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:24,520
Woman, don't you dare touch my
husband!

670
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,160
I wish I knew what are they
dragging here.

671
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,720
Looks like a guillotine.

672
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,480
After Sir Charles Darwin

673
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,280
I can expect an electric chair
from them.

674
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,320
- You're alive!
- Johnny!

675
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,040
You have a motion sickness!

676
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,040
My darling, you're safe. I can't
believe my eyes!

677
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:20,840
Calm down, dear. The Indians
just invited me to visit.

678
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:25,200
They asked me to arrange a
seance for them.

679
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,840
Billy, set it up!

680
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,840
Please, come in.

681
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,200
No, I'd never sit

682
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,280
with Injuns.

683
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,880
Mr. Atwood, cinema doesn't have
borders

684
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,000
and races. Everyone's equal
facing the screen.

685
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,160
Johnny, you're a saint.

686
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,520
- No charge today.
- A saint!

687
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,200
Where are you going? Dad, what
about me?

688
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,680
You're too little.

689
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,600
Right, and I'm not little to go
the path of war.

690
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:18,240
- But when it comes to movies...
- Shame on you, White Feather.

691
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,480
You haven't celebrated your 16th
spring yet.

692
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,040
It's my seat.

693
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,840
It's my seat.

694
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,280
Go away.

695
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,760
Chief, take that jacket off, I
can't see anything.

696
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,200
If you jerk another time, I'll
shoot you.

697
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,640
Harry, you asked me for a piece
of advice.

698
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:04,960
Here it comes. Get rid of First
immediately.

699
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,160
Or he'll ruin you.

700
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,160
Get rid of him! Drive him away!

701
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,960
That's it! Stop!

702
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,560
Stop it.

703
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,680
What's wrong, Mr. McCue?

704
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,840
What do you want?

705
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,960
I won't allow it, you don't have
a right! Everyone watches it OK.

706
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,160
I suffer losses, and they don't
even let me watch it!

707
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,120
Wait, gentlemen.

708
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,920
Harry just wants to say that he

709
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,960
terminates Mr. First's lease of
the premises.

710
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,800
That's all there is to it.
Right, Harry?

711
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,240
Yes!

712
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,280
Gentlemen, calm down!

713
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,720
I'll try to negotiate it.

714
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,000
Harry,

715
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,680
a couple of words.

716
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,600
Billy, what could we talk about?

717
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,680
Go, Billy will explain.

718
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,320
Oh my pale-faced brother,

719
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,440
tell me, is the cinema going

720
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:16,680
to turn to the life of
Comanches?

721
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:20,120
I have a smashing plot idea.

722
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,600
Yes, it's quite smashing.

723
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:33,920
Gentlemen, you have a problem
with your sense of humor.

724
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,040
It was a joke!

725
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,920
Mr. First, continue, I pray.

726
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,880
I saw it,

727
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,960
and my mind was clouded.

728
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:18,000
Not in the dead of night, not
over blind walls and fences,

729
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,920
but on a white sheet...

730
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,840
A daughter of man

731
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,840
gave a man her...

732
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,240
kiss!

733
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:35,560
The creatures of debauch and
sin,

734
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,200
that's your cinema!

735
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,760
That's why I say unto you: if
you cherish your home...

736
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,080
Go,

7361
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,280
and drive away

7362
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,240
that God-awful Mr. First.

737
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,800
Hurry, women!

738
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,760
That's him!

739
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,640
I think it's worse than a
Comanche attack.

740
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,280
He looks like needing help.

741
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,160
We want movies!

742
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,400
A woman is a movie-goer too!

743
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,960
I think, Peppy, that if a woman
asks for something, she should

744
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,800
be granted this by all means, or
she'll take it herself.

745
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,160
Billy, set it up!

746
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,320
We want a film!

747
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,720
I'll kill him!

748
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:32,400
The art...

749
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,720
cannot be destroyed!

750
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,600
Set it up!

751
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,760
For a couple of words.

752
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,640
I'm fine as it is.

753
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,120
You don't want to sit through it
under the counter.

754
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:03,040
- There'll be no film.
- There will be, Harry.

755
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,120
The art doesn't burn!

756
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,000
- Right?
- Right!

757
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,160
Is it true?

758
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,040
You know, I'm so glad!

759
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:20,520
I'm just happy. You know how I
love cinema.

760
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,440
I do! Let's go!

761
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,440
Let's talk about your love of
it.

762
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:29,640
I hope, you'll remember this
conversation.

763
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,120
Let go of me, it hurts!

764
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,240
Don't get underfoot.

765
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,480
Oh it's perfectly fine.

766
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,920
Father, stop it.

767
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,440
We didn't come here for this.

768
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,880
Don't do it.

769
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,640
Don't!

770
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,320
- Hi, Chico!
- Good morning, sir!

771
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,480
Good morning, Mr. First!

772
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,920
Good morning, Billy! Is
everything right?

773
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,440
If I undertake something, I do
it.

774
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,320
- Everything's right.
- Mr. First.

775
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,600
- Good morning.
- Greetings.

776
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,560
Do you recognize me?

777
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,200
Sure! You're the undertaker.

778
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,640
- An ex-philosopher.
- It's in the past now.

779
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:50,000
Good morning, Ms. Diana!

780
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,640
Time to wake up.

781
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,200
Good morning, Conchita.

782
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,200
Your sheet...

783
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,040
I mean, your screen...

784
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,320
has been stolen!

785
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:37,000
Santa Maria, a drop to your
feet. Perform a miracle!

786
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,840
You know, in our town there's no
more white sheets.

787
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,120
Santa Maria, you've always been
so kind.

788
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,920
No time for pray.

789
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,880
Well, I'm unemployed now,

790
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:56,520
because people don't want to
part with their lives.

791
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,320
So I had a marvelous idea once,

792
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:03,840
why don't we organize a printed
edition in our town?

793
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,760
It could be entitled, say,

794
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,200
"Cinema", and it would cover

795
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:12,320
only the cinematographic issues.

796
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,320
What's good there, and the main

797
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,320
point, what's bad.

798
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,520
I've watched almost all films,

799
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:24,800
I start to have some ideas.

800
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,960
They might be interesting for
other people, too.

801
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,480
What do you think of my idea?

802
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:36,640
I think that if a philosopher
could become an undertaker,

803
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,520
why doesn't an undertaker

8031
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,080
become a critic?

804
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,040
Quick, Conchita.

805
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,320
My darling,

806
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,960
my love, hello.

807
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,280
Don't be cross with me. Forgive
me.

808
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,640
- Quick, Ms. Diana!
- Conchita, scissors.

809
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:00,920
Bear with it.

810
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,040
Put it here.

811
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,560
What if you won't be in time?

812
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,600
I should.

813
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,760
- I won't survive the shame.
- You won't do it!

814
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,680
Don't touch it.

815
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,080
A girl that couldn't save the
most valuable thing

816
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,360
she has for her husband to be,
deserves death.

817
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,800
Billy, I'm showing it for the
last time.

818
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,960
There's no more.

819
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,280
That's it.

820
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,600
No, not this. The death is
better!

821
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:47,520
The art, Concita, demands
sacrifices.

822
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,600
We've made a new screen.

823
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,080
Take your seats, gentlemen.

824
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,920
The slave to love!

825
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,080
Why did you seek me?

826
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,760
Harry McCue?

827
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,240
Jack!

828
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,720
What can you do for money?

829
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,160
For money, I can do everything.

830
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,400
Here's $1000.

831
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:51,320
The life of the man named First.

832
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Begging your pardon, miss.

833
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:17,160
Sir, some old woman is asking
for you.

834
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,400
- For me?
- Yes, you. She's afraid...

835
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:24,600
...to cross the street, and says
only you could help her.

836
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,040
My love,

837
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,560
I'll be back.

838
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:38,560
Billy...

839
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,640
Set it up!

840
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,560
Where's your granny?

841
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,280
Here you are.

842
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:54,000
Good evening.

843
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,960
Allow me to offer you help,
miss.

844
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:12,200
So our paths have crossed, sir.

845
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,520
To tell you the truth, I don't
enjoy it much.

846
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,880
Yes, I recognized you, "granny".

847
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,920
I offered you a place in
history.

848
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:42,040
You should visit our seances by
all means.

849
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,480
I invite you to the cinema.

850
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,800
I'm here!

851
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:51,760
You could cross the street in
some other place, granny.

852
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,160
Johnny!

853
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:08,000
Bear with it, my friend.

854
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:47,920
My love...

855
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:49,840
Don't die!

856
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:52,880
Don't die...

857
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,960
Jesus, I wish I could start
living anew...

858
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:08,720
How could I save you?

859
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:12,920
Only a miracle could save him
now.

860
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,400
No!

861
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,680
You road...

862
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,640
is long.

863
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,440
Wait, father.

864
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,840
Johnny...

865
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,240
Tell us your last...

866
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:35,920
No!

867
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,880
I swear...

868
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,680
we'll fulfil it.

869
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,640
We swear!

870
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:46,040
Billy...

871
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,160
Set it up!

872
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,320
A genius!

873
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,280
Could I go with you anyway?

874
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:10,880
Don't worry, my friend, nothing
bad will happen to me.

875
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,560
I hope he doesn't leave for
long.

876
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:25,440
I can't picture a day without
cinema.

877
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,840
Mr. First leaves for 3 days only
to get wedding presents.

878
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,440
- When do they have the wedding?
- On Sunday.

879
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:34,160
Is it true that the priest
refused to marry them?

880
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:36,960
It is. Yet Billy persuaded him.

881
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:40,200
I can imagine how he did that.

882
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,120
Cinema, cinema, cinema,

883
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:01,000
We're crazy about you.

884
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,640
Get lost!

885
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,280
Cinema... cinema...

886
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:16,400
We're crazy about you.

887
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,800
Whom do you see off?

888
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,360
Oh, he was a great man!

889
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:28,040
Why was he great?

890
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:31,120
He was the first to introduce
the cinema to us.

891
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:34,600
In this case, I'll be the next
one. My name's Second.

892
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,760
Are you the owner of this
saloon?

893
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,480
- I am.
- I have a business proposal.

894
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,920
He unscrews his head.

895
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,360
The cranium must crackle now.

896
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,840
What a big,

897
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,640
fat and delicious hand!

898
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,280
Now, the finger.

899
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:49,120
Andy, you forgot the second
ear. Well, excellent.

900
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:52,280
Guys, this is the real life.
Now, the leg...

901
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:59,440
How could you watch that junk?

902
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:03,400
That's awful shit, Mr. First.

903
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:07,240
I wish you knew how I miss your
films!

904
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:10,320
They could've made me human.

905
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,520
But the truth is bitter, in this
country

906
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:15,280
only the money could make a
gentleman human,

907
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:18,040
and Mr. Second's films bring me
money.

908
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:20,320
Mr. McCue, I've always suspected

909
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:24,000
that a businessman would kill a
movie-goer in you. But you...

910
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:26,840
Billy, how could you like it?

911
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,200
I watched it from the corner of
one eye.

912
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,000
Guys, enough sniveling!

913
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:39,720
You'll have the sequel!

914
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,960
Where's my steak?

915
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:55,240
Let me through, I have an urgent
business.

916
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:02,480
Are you all right, Mr. First?

917
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,240
- Where's Diana?
- Upstairs, with the priest.

918
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:04,200
Mr. First, my life is in your
hands.

919
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,080
But before you pull the trigger,

920
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,600
you should know, you'll never

921
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,560
find a man more faithful to you.

922
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:16,240
>From Mexico to Canada. I knew a
lot of happiness,

923
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:20,000
love of women and power of
money,

924
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:24,040
but all this is dust compared to
this.

925
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:28,840
I'll dedicate my whole life to
this God,

926
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,160
if you would leave it to me, of
course.

927
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,160
Say no more!

928
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:38,920
>From now on, my Colt and my

929
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:41,440
fists are at your service.

930
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:44,440
But before we set out from
here...

931
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,120
I should take revenge on Mr.
Second.

932
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:50,800
He desecrated the name of the
cinema.

933
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:53,800
He sows the seeds of hatred in
the audience's souls.

934
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,720
- He should die.
- Don't do it, Jack.

935
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:00,200
To each his own. The future will
judge us.

936
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:04,000
Let's move on, our audience's
waiting!

937
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:10,560
Oil both of your Colts real
good,

938
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,800
Oil your Winchester rifle, too,

939
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:17,120
And move on, because

940
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:20,360
You just had a fancy to move.

941
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:23,360
Let's go, that's all right,

942
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:26,280
Riding or walking.

943
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:29,680
I swear by the name of the
bloodthirsty coyote,

944
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:32,960
We'll reach some destination!

945
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:43,440
What will be, will be,

946
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,560
Whatever might happen,

947
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:50,040
What will be, will be,
And that's what there is.

948
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:52,320
Starring:

949
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:56,080
Projectionist, roll it,

950
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,160
Put the alarm lamps out,

951
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:01,320
Andrey Mironov

952
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:04,720
Add your bit of light
To the severe days of souls.

953
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:07,480
Alexandra Aasmae

954
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:10,240
Light your ray up from the
window, and believe as we do,

Mikhail Boyarsky
Oleg Tabakov

956
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:17,120
That this plain can be crossed
Almost without losses.
