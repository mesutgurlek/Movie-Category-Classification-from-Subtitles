All right, quit stalling and get in.

- Suppose these survival outfits don't work?
- Yeah.

filed a written guarantee.

00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,185
SAILOR 2:
Listen, I know how to bake a cake.

SAILOR 1: Pick me.

Hey, we did it.

All right, come on, get in.

23
00:03:07,837 --> 00:03:10,772
- Pretty cute gag about that cake, Bill.
- No gag.

24
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,771
- Well, what happened to the cook?
- Sick.

25
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,933
And I have to have a cake baked.
A good one.

26
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,477
I already had one volunteer,
and he didn't work out.

27
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:19,444
Well, what's the deal? Brief us on it.

28
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,449
There just happens to be a plane due in
with replacements.

29
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,144
- Replacements.
- Hey, we're getting out of cold storage.

30
00:03:25,321 --> 00:03:26,549
Slow down.

31
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:30,090
Only three replacements are coming up,
and only three men are going out.

32
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,852
One, two, three. It figures.

33
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:33,791
Yeah, it depends on the cake.

34
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,261
Now, the skipper's
cutting the orders himself.

35
00:03:36,432 --> 00:03:40,960
Today is his birthday,
and he's very sentimental about birthdays.

36
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:44,368
So I figured if I walked in
carrying the cake...

37
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,202
...and you two guys followed me
singing "Happy Birthday"...

38
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:49,368
- Hey, that's a good idea.
- "Happy Birthday."

39
00:03:49,545 --> 00:03:51,137
It's only as good as the cake.

- Hi, George.
DANNY: What do you say, George?

41
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,183
- You got a cake.
- Yeah, if you can call it a cake.

42
00:03:58,354 --> 00:04:01,346
- You see what I mean?
- I followed the cookbook.

43
00:04:01,524 --> 00:04:03,890
Well, next time, learn how to read,
will you?

44
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,085
Now get going.

45
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:08,287
The skipper won't like it
if you get loaded.

46
00:04:08,464 --> 00:04:11,490
So what'll he do, send me home?

47
00:04:12,535 --> 00:04:14,162
You sure you guys can handle this?

48
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,635
Oh, anybody can bake a cake.

- Sure, women do it all the time.

50

Yeah, women have babies all the time too,
but we don't.

Wow. That's what I call living.

156
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,318
A boy's best friend is his mother,
but there's nothing wrong with this, either.

157
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:18,358
Now, if you guys want dates,
I'll just say the word to Ginger.

158
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:20,688
And with Ginger, what I say goes.

159
00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:23,627
Well, even if Dad is home,
I could get away around 11 or so.

160
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,528
Susie'll be asleep long before that.

161
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:27,828
Mom's getting older,
likes to get to bed early.

162
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:29,630
Okay, you guys are in business.

163
00:11:29,805 --> 00:11:33,536
You be here 11:00, you watch the show,
you pick out you what you want...

164
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:35,939
...and Ginger will deliver.

165
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,580
- Okay, chief.
- See you later.

Ginger.

206
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,062
What's the matter, honey?
I'm gone for almost a year.

207
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:25,672
I break my neck to see you.
You don't even say hello.

208
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:29,004
Hello. And now
that that's over, goodbye.

209
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,874
But I brought you a present.
Aren't you even gonna open it?

210
00:15:32,047 --> 00:15:33,480
I'm not opening a gift shop.

211
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:36,948
But it's a genuine baby turtle
from the south seas.

212
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:39,610
Great. That's just what I needed.

213
00:15:39,788 --> 00:15:41,415
First, a parrot, now a turtle.

214
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,388
Always another mouth to feed.
I don't want him.

215
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,996
Oh, but he's only a baby.
What'll I do with him?

216
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:49,755
You know what you can do with him?

217
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:52,799
Throw him in the bay, head him south,
and let him swim home.

218
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:55,232
And you can go with him.

219
00:15:55,938 --> 00:15:58,270
Oh, I don't understand.

220
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,841
What are you mad about?
What did I do?

221
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:06,107
Nothing. For six years, nothing.

222
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:10,411
You know, when a girl gets engaged,
sooner or later, she'd like to get married.

223
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:13,282
Oh, honey, don't start that all over again.

224
00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:15,650
I wanna get married too,
but being in the Navy...

225
00:16:15,824 --> 00:16:17,849
If it's so bad,
why do you keep reenlisting?

226
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:21,519
- Well, it's my job. It's what I do.
- It's your alibi.

227
00:16:21,697 --> 00:16:24,962
For six years, you've been using it
as an excuse, and I'm tired of it.

228
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:27,694
I wanna get married and settle down
like everybody else.

229
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,306
- I promise as soon as this cruise is over...
- Yeah, well, don't rush.

230
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:33,668
I found somebody else.

231
00:16:33,842 --> 00:16:35,241
You found somebo...?

232
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,471
Oh, no. You can't do that to me.

233
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:42,777
You're my girl. I'd die for you.
You know that.

234
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:46,148
Yeah, well, that's the difference
between you and Herman.

235
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:48,380
Herman wants to marry me
and take care of me.

236
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:51,993
But you? You'd sooner drop dead.

237
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:54,989
Okay, drop dead.

238
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:06,641
- Mom.
- Rico. Rico.

239
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:09,107
I'm so glad to see you. Oh!

240
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,644
- You look taller and handsome.
- You look beautiful.

241
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:13,076
- How's my girl?
- Fine, fine.

242
00:17:13,248 --> 00:17:15,512
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming home today?

243
00:17:15,684 --> 00:17:19,552
- I thought you might like a surprise.
- Oh, a surprise. It certainly is, believe me.

244
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:23,021
- Mr. Peroni is visiting.
- Peroni? Who's he?

245
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:26,355
Well, he bought the flower shop
on the corner about six months ago.

246
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:30,487
He's a very lovely man,
and we're keeping company.

247
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,066
Great, best news I ever heard.
I'd like to meet him.

248
00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:36,170
Of course, but it might be a surprise
to him too.

249
00:17:36,338 --> 00:17:39,068
- Why? Didn't you tell him about me?
- Certainly, I did.

250
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:42,267
But he doesn't think
I have such a grown-up son.

251
00:17:42,444 --> 00:17:45,572
And I know it's silly, but if he sees
how grown-up you are...

252
00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:47,340
...he might think I'm an old lady.

253
00:17:47,516 --> 00:17:49,643
Oh, Mom.

254
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,286
PERONl:
What's keeping you so long...?

255
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:55,782
What's going on here?

256
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:59,189
Come inside, Rico, and meet Mr. Peroni.

257
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:08,533
Mr. Peroni, I want you to meet a young man
I'm very proud of:

258
00:18:08,704 --> 00:18:10,467
My son, Rico.

259
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:12,573
Your son?

260
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:15,766
PERONl:
Hmph.

261
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,779
- Hmph. Son.
- I'm very happy to know you, Mr. Peroni.

262
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,612
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to barge in...
- That's all right.

263
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:26,084
I was going to leave anyway.

264
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:28,519
Oh, not at all.
Look, I have to meet some friends.

265
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,126
You stay right here. I'm sure you
and Mom have a lot to talk about.

266
00:18:32,294 --> 00:18:33,693
I'll be back later.

267
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:37,093
And I'm looking forward
to seeing you again too, Pop.

268
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:40,060
I mean, Mr. Peroni.

269
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:44,272
Well, for 9 years old,
he's pretty grown-up.

270
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:48,933
- You know boys. They grow up overnight.
- Must have been a long night.

271
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:53,013
To a mother, no matter how big they are,
they're always babies.

272
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:55,173
You're not angry
just because I exaggerate...

273
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,480
Well, I don't know. I don't know
whether I'm angry, but I'm upset.

274
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:00,883
A grown-up son.

275
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,115
You didn't think I was a bobbysoxer,
did you?

276
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,055
But I did not bargain for that much.

277
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,889
I'm glad to hear it,
because with most men...

278
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,327
...the older they get,
the younger they want them.

279
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:11,966
Oh, so I'm an old man now?

280
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:14,898
Well, let me tell you something.
I am not yet 50.

281
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,630
- And I'm not 45.
- With a man, it's much different.

282
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:19,740
Not with the insurance companies.

283
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,877
They say that most women
outlive their husbands.

284
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:26,014
Now she's got me dead already.
That's enough.

285
00:19:26,181 --> 00:19:27,205
Where are you going?

286
00:19:27,382 --> 00:19:31,045
I have a very stylish wedding.
I have to get the flowers ready.

287
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:35,455
And I'm not too old to work all night.

288
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:02,283
Hello, Father.

289
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:06,012
- Daniel, glad to see you.
- Thank you, sir. You look well, sir.

290
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:09,385
I'm just leaving for San Diego,
but I'll be back in a couple of days.

291
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:10,650
We can have a talk then.

292
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:12,851
I won't be here, sir. I only have a 48.

293
00:20:13,028 --> 00:20:16,987
Oh, that's too bad,
but it can't be helped. Uh...

294
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:19,258
Tell me, why did you come in
the back way?

295
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:22,995
- Something wrong with the front door?
- I didn't want to tangle with your men.

296
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:26,368
You know how they are,
always curious about an admiral's family.

297
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,203
- Still keeping it dark, eh?
- Yes, sir.

298
00:20:29,378 --> 00:20:32,575
What's the matter with you?
Are you ashamed of me?

299
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:36,616
In my time, I was very proud of the fact
that my father was an admiral.

300
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:38,980
My father felt the same way
about his father.

301
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,215
You're not gonna keep me dark

302
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:46,054
It's different there, sir. In Annapolis,
everyone has brass in his ancestry.

303
00:20:46,228 --> 00:20:48,822
I'm not an ancestor yet.
I'm still in active service.

- What is there to understand?

- But, well, if they knew about you...

307
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,369
...they'd think I was asking
for special privileges.

308
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:02,635
Then I'd have no more friends
and no more fun.

One of them was called Smith.
Danny Smith.

- And the others?
- Well, they were friends of his.

Shouldn't be hard
to find out who they are.

914
01:04:05,815 --> 01:04:08,010
- You can't do that.
- We're all in this together.

915
01:04:08,184 --> 01:04:10,948
Now, wait a minute.
I got news for you and for you.

916
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:14,112
The only one I care about is Bilge.
He's in a real jam.

917
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:15,882
Fourteen years to get your rating.

918
01:04:16,059 --> 01:04:18,755
Fourteen years,
and they'll bust you right down to nothing.

919
01:04:18,928 --> 01:04:21,260
What you need is an alibi,
and I've got it for you.

920
01:04:21,431 --> 01:04:22,796
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

921
01:04:22,965 --> 01:04:23,989
What is it?

922
01:04:24,167 --> 01:04:27,796
Well, you got off the ship,
came straight to my place...

923
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:30,029
...and stayed there all night.

924
01:04:30,206 --> 01:04:32,606
SUSAN: Would you really say
a thing like that, Ginger?

925
01:04:32,775 --> 01:04:35,505
For Bilge, yes.

926
01:04:35,678 --> 01:04:36,906
That might work, Bill.

927
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,344
It might work
but I'm not gonna let her do it.

928
01:04:39,515 --> 01:04:41,244
What kind of a guy do you think I am?

929
01:04:41,417 --> 01:04:43,317
Well, somebody's gotta
look out after you.

930
01:04:43,486 --> 01:04:45,920
You're such a dope,
always sticking your neck out.

931
01:04:46,089 --> 01:04:48,057
They could bust you for a thing like this.

932
01:04:48,224 --> 01:04:51,352
I'll get busted, but I'm not gonna
let them talk that way about you.

933
01:04:51,527 --> 01:04:54,462
You know, if you two were married,
it would be all right.

934
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:57,565
Now, there's a girl
with a head on her shoulders.

935
01:04:57,734 --> 01:05:02,068
You know, that never occurred to me.
Did it occur to you, Bill?

936
01:05:02,238 --> 01:05:05,503
Ginger, baby, you know
I've got too much respect for you...

937
01:05:05,675 --> 01:05:08,337
...to let you marry me
just to do me a favor.

938
01:05:08,511 --> 01:05:12,845
When I ask you to be my wife,
it won't be because I need an alibi.

939
01:05:13,015 --> 01:05:15,984
That's the same phony line
you've been handing me for six years.

940
01:05:16,152 --> 01:05:18,552
Ginger, baby,
I worship the ground you walk on.

941
01:05:18,721 --> 01:05:23,351
Now he's talking real estate.
Okay, sailor, this is it!

942
01:05:23,526 --> 01:05:27,018
As far as I'm concerned, I've had it!

943
01:05:29,132 --> 01:05:30,929
(POUNDING)

944
01:05:32,969 --> 01:05:35,904
Sometimes Ginger gets a little upset.

945
01:05:36,072 --> 01:05:38,870
Her big mistake is she thinks more of you
than you do of her.

946
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:42,909
Now, wait a minute.
As far as I'm concerned, she's the best.

947
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:44,842
What are you waiting for? Second best?

948
01:05:45,014 --> 01:05:48,848
What goes on between Ginger and me
is none of your business.

949
01:05:49,018 --> 01:05:51,816
Is that so? Well, if you've made
my affairs your business...

950
01:05:51,988 --> 01:05:55,185
Don't you start with me!
You've got me enough trouble already.

951
01:05:55,358 --> 01:05:56,586
RICO:
Take it easy, chief.

952
01:05:56,759 --> 01:05:59,819
I'm going up on the roof
and get some air.

953
01:06:02,932 --> 01:06:03,921
(POUNDING)

954

MAN: Take it easy, please!
I'm trying to get some sleep.

955
01:06:06,435 --> 01:06:09,268
Susie, you shouldn't mix
in Bill's personal affairs.

956
01:06:09,438 --> 01:06:12,635
And who are you to talk?
You mixed in mine, didn't you?

957
01:06:12,809 --> 01:06:15,437
- This whole thing's your fault.
- That's the thanks I get.

958
01:06:15,611 --> 01:06:18,671
- You had no right to interfere.
- Somebody's gotta look out for you.

959
01:06:18,848 --> 01:06:22,648
- You don't know to keep out of trouble.
- There was no trouble till you came along.

960
01:06:22,819 --> 01:06:24,480
Don't you forget that.

961
01:06:25,521 --> 01:06:27,512
MAN (POUNDING):
Hey, cut it out!

962
01:06:28,157 --> 01:06:30,284
What are you barking at her for?
She's right.

963
01:06:30,459 --> 01:06:31,653
You had to go barging in.

964
01:06:31,828 --> 01:06:34,388
Look, it was a private fight.
You stuck your nose in it.

965
01:06:34,564 --> 01:06:37,328
That's not fair.
Rico and Bill were just trying to help you.

966
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,866
- Now, you keep out of this.
- Danny Smith!

967
01:06:40,036 --> 01:06:42,903
I hardly know you. You came to me
and got me mixed up in this.

968
01:06:43,072 --> 01:06:46,098
Okay. You're not mixed up in it anymore.
Now, stay out of it.

969
01:06:46,275 --> 01:06:50,735
It'll be a pleasure. And don't think
it hasn't been fun, because it hasn't.

970
01:06:51,981 --> 01:06:54,381
MAN: I'm coming down there
and knock your head off!

971
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:57,075
- Come and try it.
- One fight a night isn't good enough?

972
01:06:57,253 --> 01:06:59,517
Oh, go soak your head!

973
01:07:00,489 --> 01:07:03,754
MAN (POUNDING):
I'm coming down! I'm warning you!

974
01:07:03,926 --> 01:07:06,053
What happened to the party?
Where is everybody?

975
01:07:06,229 --> 01:07:08,060
Who cares? Where you been, Mom?

976
01:07:08,231 --> 01:07:10,631
I took some food to Mr. Peroni,
but he wouldn't eat.

977
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,291
Not good enough for him, huh?
Who does he think he is?

978
01:07:13,469 --> 01:07:17,269
- Lf I'm not mad at him, why should you be?
- I'll get mad at him if I feel like it.

979
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,034
And I feel like it. Good night.

Shut up yourself!

GINGER:
Carol, come sit down.

983
01:07:33,723 --> 01:07:35,987
- Men!
- You can have them.

984
01:07:36,158 --> 01:07:37,557
I don't want them.

985
01:07:37,727 --> 01:07:40,594
I gave him six
of the best years of my life.

986
01:07:40,763 --> 01:07:45,063
How do you like that guy?
I do him a favor and he bites my head off.

987
01:07:45,234 --> 01:07:47,725
You take my advice, Ginger,
and marry Herman.

988
01:07:47,904 --> 01:07:50,737
No, even better,
marry Bilge and make his life miserable.

989
01:07:50,907 --> 01:07:55,037
And you, Carol, never do a man a favor.
They only hate you for it.

990
01:07:55,645 --> 01:07:57,545
You think you have trouble.

991
01:07:57,713 --> 01:08:01,274
A couple of hours ago,
I had four men fighting over me.

992
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:03,509
Now I have nothing.

<i>They take your heart</i>
<i>And break your heart</i>

1003

Oh, I thought I heard your car.
Anything wrong, sir?

01:09:55,765 --> 01:09:57,323
Didn't mean to awaken you, Jenny.

1010
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,936
No, the meeting was cancelled,
so I flew right back.

1011
01:10:01,103 --> 01:10:03,469
I suppose the children are asleep already.

1012

Miss Susan's in, but Daniel isn't in yet.

1013
01:10:07,276 --> 01:10:11,610
Pretty late. He knows I don't
approve of these late hours.

01:10:11,781 --> 01:10:13,646
You go on back to bed, Jenny.
Good night.

We're looking for him. Where is he?

1019

- He's in there. I'll tell him.
- Never mind. We'll tell him.

Straighten up, chum. This is it...

01:10:46,082 --> 01:10:48,744
At ease. What can I do for you?

1023
01:10:48,918 --> 01:10:51,045
- Admiral, we were looking...
- We made a mistake.

1024
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,279
One at a time. Looking for what?

Daniel Smith, sir.

1026
01:10:55,224 --> 01:10:57,488
I'm Daniel Smith. What do you want?

1027
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:01,152
We were told
that this Daniel Smith was a sailor, sir.

Well, what do you think I am?
A ballet dancer?

01:11:03,632 --> 01:11:05,395
- No, sir.
- Then speak up.

1030
01:11:05,568 --> 01:11:08,002
We're supposed to put you
under arrest, admiral.

Well, that's better.

You're what?

And may I ask why?

1034
01:11:19,315 --> 01:11:22,079
Well, you beat up a civilian
named Wendell Craig.

1035
01:11:22,251 --> 01:11:23,445
You wrecked his apartment.

1036
01:11:23,619 --> 01:11:24,643
Why?

1037
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:27,380
Please, sir,
I'm sure there's been a mistake.

1038
01:11:27,556 --> 01:11:29,751
SMITH:
Answer my question.

1039
01:11:29,925 --> 01:11:36,421
Well, it seems that you and him
were having a fight over a broad.

1040
01:11:36,799 --> 01:11:37,823
I mean, a dame.

1041
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,934
- He means a girl.
- Don't explain.

1042
01:11:40,102 --> 01:11:42,366
I've been in the Navy all my life.

1043
01:11:42,538 --> 01:11:47,168
Of all the incompetent, idiotic,
insane, outrageous...

1044
01:11:47,343 --> 01:11:49,243
As soon as we saw you, sir...

1045
01:11:49,411 --> 01:11:51,572
...we had the feeling
that something was wrong.

1046
01:11:51,747 --> 01:11:55,012
Oh, did you? How very shrewd.

1047
01:11:55,184 --> 01:11:57,584
You ought to be in Naval Intelligence.

1048
01:11:57,753 --> 01:12:00,415
Yes, sir. Just following orders, sir.

1049
01:12:00,589 --> 01:12:03,820
We were given
this sailor's name and address.

1050
01:12:05,528 --> 01:12:07,155
SMITH:
Huh.

1051
01:12:07,763 --> 01:12:09,788
Yeah, quite right.

1052
01:12:10,065 --> 01:12:13,466
Uh, I'm sorry I lost my temper.

1053
01:12:13,636 --> 01:12:18,073
I should've realized that there must be
more than one Daniel Smith in the Navy.

1054
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,107
Soon as you find this man,
I want to be notified at once.

1055
01:12:21,277 --> 01:12:22,301
Dismissed.

1056
01:12:22,478 --> 01:12:24,207
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1057
01:12:39,361 --> 01:12:41,921
SMITH: That you, Susan?
- Father, you startled me.

1058
01:12:42,097 --> 01:12:44,691
- I thought you were away.
- The meeting was cancelled.

1059
01:12:44,867 --> 01:12:46,630
Where were you last night?

1060
01:12:46,802 --> 01:12:49,635
A concert. I went to a concert.

1061
01:12:49,805 --> 01:12:51,739

Not a thing.
Why should anything be wrong?

- No reason. Just thought I'd ask.
- You don't know where he went, do you?

1067
01:13:06,121 --> 01:13:08,385
Probably went with some of the boys
from the ship.

that would marry without love.

01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:20,094
Aye, aye, sir.

1363
01:33:20,268 --> 01:33:23,431
If the admiral prefers,
I'd be happy to talk to him for you.

1364
01:33:23,604 --> 01:33:27,370
Thanks, but it's my problem
and I'll have to sweat it out.

- Mm?

- Yes, I know.

JACKSON: Morning, admiral.
- Carry on, Mr. Jackson.

You all look as if you had
at least normal intelligence...

1431
01:39:38,245 --> 01:39:41,442
...so I can only conclude that you knew
what you were doing, correct?

1432
01:39:41,615 --> 01:39:43,048
DANNY, BILL & RICO:
Yes, sir.

1433
01:39:43,217 --> 01:39:47,278
You, in particular,
should have a sense of responsibility.

1434
01:39:47,454 --> 01:39:50,514
Obviously, it was a mistake
to promote you to your present rate...

...but we'll take care of that.

DANNY: With the admiral's permission, sir...
- I know.

1437
01:39:54,762 --> 01:39:58,721
You'll each say it was your fault.
Very noble. Everybody bails everybody out.

1438
01:39:58,899 --> 01:40:03,927
Well, it doesn't impress me.
You've all behaved like idiots.

1439
01:40:04,104 --> 01:40:08,438
I know the facts. A brawl over a woman,
and no fancy talk will change it.

1440
01:40:08,609 --> 01:40:11,373
It will happen every time you pick up
a no-good, conniving...

1441
01:40:11,545 --> 01:40:14,241
With permission, I don't think
the character of the lady...

1442
01:40:14,415 --> 01:40:18,215
Lady? You'd better look up
the meaning of that word, sailor.

1443
01:40:18,385 --> 01:40:21,752
Yes, I think the admiral should know
that I hope to marry the young lady.

1444
01:40:21,922 --> 01:40:23,389
Some wife you'll be getting.

1445
01:40:23,557 --> 01:40:26,720
You have to break into a man's hotel room
to fight for her honor.

1446
01:40:26,894 --> 01:40:28,862
With permission,
that's not quite accurate.

1447
01:40:29,029 --> 01:40:32,487
Don't talk to me about these pickups.
They're no-good, cheap, common...

1448
01:40:32,666 --> 01:40:36,363
With the admiral's permission, sir,
this young lady isn't.

1449
01:40:36,537 --> 01:40:39,734
I suppose you're an authority
on these matters, sailor?

1450
01:40:39,907 --> 01:40:44,435
On this matter, sir, I am.
I know the young lady very well.

1451
01:40:45,145 --> 01:40:47,306
She's my sister.

1452
01:40:49,617 --> 01:40:51,517
She's your...?

1453
01:40:54,388 --> 01:40:56,083
If that's a joke...

1454
01:40:56,257 --> 01:40:58,953
No, sir. None of us
consider this a laughing matter.

1455
01:41:07,001 --> 01:41:09,401
These men are confined to base
until further orders.

1456
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:11,504
Aye, aye, sir.

1457

- Dismissed.
SMITH: Mr. Jackson.

1458

Anything I can do, sir?

1460
01:41:20,648 --> 01:41:23,947
I'm afraid there's nothing anyone can do.
Thank you.

You can't come in here.

1464
01:41:31,959 --> 01:41:34,086
When my boy's in trouble,
I can go anywhere.

1465
01:41:34,261 --> 01:41:36,126
- Listen to me.
- The admiral isn't here.

1466
01:41:36,297 --> 01:41:37,559
Then you tell him.

1467
01:41:37,731 --> 01:41:40,825
I'm a lieutenant, and lieutenants
don't tell admirals anything.

1468
01:41:41,001 --> 01:41:44,061
- Not if they still wanna be lieutenants.
- Then I wait for him here.

1469
01:41:44,238 --> 01:41:47,230
- Fine. Well, I'll tell you what I'll do.
- This is very important.

1470
01:41:47,408 --> 01:41:50,172
- What's going on around here?
- That's what I'd like to know.

1471
01:41:50,344 --> 01:41:51,971
- Where's Danny?
- I was telling him...

1472
01:41:52,146 --> 01:41:54,774
- What's the matter?
- What are you trying to do to Bilge?

1473
01:41:54,949 --> 01:41:57,281
- I'll write my congressman.
- All we wanna know is...

1474
01:41:57,451 --> 01:41:59,112
- My boy...
- Ladies, you can't do this.

1475
01:41:59,286 --> 01:42:00,651
I can do anything I want to.

1476
01:42:00,821 --> 01:42:03,085
- Why, I'm old enough to be your mother.
MARINE: Come on.

1477
01:42:03,257 --> 01:42:05,316
Take your hand off me
or I'll knock you flat.

1478
01:42:05,492 --> 01:42:10,623
- Now, just tell us where you put...
- lf you'll just stop hollering, I'll listen.

1479
01:42:10,798 --> 01:42:12,459
Now, that's a good boy.

1480
01:42:19,406 --> 01:42:21,738
Just where do you think
you're going, young lady?

1481
01:42:21,909 --> 01:42:23,968
I was on the way to the base
to see you, Dad.

1482
01:42:24,144 --> 01:42:27,409
I want to talk about the trouble
Danny and his friends are in.

1483
01:42:27,581 --> 01:42:30,015
- I'm the girl the fight was about.
- Yes.

1484
01:42:30,184 --> 01:42:32,243
And it makes a pretty picture, doesn't it?

1485
01:42:32,419 --> 01:42:35,718
A girl like you, at your age,
up in a man's apartment. I...

1486
01:42:35,889 --> 01:42:39,757
Well, I'm not a child anymore, you know.
You don't wanna admit it, but I've grown.

1487
01:42:39,927 --> 01:42:45,092
Then I don't see why you didn't have sense
enough to keep out of this mess with Craig.

1488
01:42:45,265 --> 01:42:48,792
There isn't any mess,
but not at least the way you mean it.

1489
01:42:48,969 --> 01:42:51,870
- Why do you believe the worst about me?
- What else can I think?

1490
01:42:52,039 --> 01:42:55,475
That I'm your daughter, and wouldn't stand
for anything cheap and shabby.

1491
01:42:55,642 --> 01:42:57,940
Then why did Daniel have to save you?

1492
01:42:58,112 --> 01:43:00,774
Because he's just like you,
jumping to conclusions.

1493
01:43:00,948 --> 01:43:04,111
He didn't have to save me.
Nobody had to save me.

1494
01:43:04,284 --> 01:43:08,152
Once I found out what Craig was really like,
I'd have enough sense to walk away.

1495
01:43:08,322 --> 01:43:12,156
I don't know why you couldn't have come
to me and talked about this before.

1496
01:43:12,326 --> 01:43:15,887
Would you have listened,
or would you have just issued a command?

1497
01:43:21,769 --> 01:43:23,634
I'm sorry.

1498
01:43:24,271 --> 01:43:29,470
I didn't realize that having an admiral
for a father might have some disadvantages.

1499
01:43:31,211 --> 01:43:33,805
Oh, it has its advantages too.

1500
01:43:33,981 --> 01:43:36,916
- Oh, you've gotta help them, Dad.
- I can't do a thing.

1501
01:43:37,084 --> 01:43:41,248
The fact that you were just naive,
and Daniel's motives were the best...

1502
01:43:41,422 --> 01:43:43,390
...doesn't alter what he did.

1503
01:43:43,557 --> 01:43:45,752
They're such wonderful fellows.
Talk to them.

1504
01:43:45,926 --> 01:43:48,326
I have talked to them.

1505
01:43:49,730 --> 01:43:52,961
- Did you like Danny's friends?
- Of course I liked them.

1506
01:43:53,133 --> 01:43:56,193
- And Rico? Did you like him?
- Uh...

1507
01:43:56,370 --> 01:43:59,430
You mean Ferrari? Yes.

1508
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:04,309
Oh, he's the fellow that told me
he was going to marry you.

1509
01:44:05,079 --> 01:44:06,842
- He did?
- Yeah.

1510
01:44:07,014 --> 01:44:10,177
Of course,
he didn't know that I was your father.

1511
01:44:13,821 --> 01:44:16,722
Just what are you beaming about?

1512
01:44:18,258 --> 01:44:20,624
I had exactly the same idea.

1513
01:44:20,794 --> 01:44:22,557
Oh, you did?

1514
01:44:22,729 --> 01:44:27,530
Well, let me tell you something, young lady.
Nobody in this family marries a sailor.

1515
01:44:27,701 --> 01:44:31,569
Excuse me, sir. Lieutenant Jackson's
downstairs and wants to see you.

1516
01:44:31,738 --> 01:44:35,367
- Tell him I'm busy.
- But he insists, sir. It's very important.

1517
01:44:35,542 --> 01:44:40,673
He insists?
Has the whole Navy gone mad?

1518
01:44:42,116 --> 01:44:44,311
And don't you dare leave this house,
young lady.

1519
01:44:44,485 --> 01:44:48,046
I have enough worries about your brother
without having you dash off to get married.

1520
01:44:48,222 --> 01:44:49,382
(SUSAN CHUCKLES)

1521
01:44:49,556 --> 01:44:51,751
What's this about getting married?

1522
01:44:51,925 --> 01:44:53,586
Soon as he asks me.

1523
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:56,320
- And who is he?
- Oh, you'll meet him, Jenny.

1524
01:44:56,497 --> 01:45:00,160
When things settle down, I'm going
to have Rico and his mother over for dinner.

1525
01:45:00,334 --> 01:45:02,097
Well, that sounds more like it.

1526
01:45:02,269 --> 01:45:04,669
Just what's going on, Mr. Jackson?
In all my years...

1527
01:45:04,838 --> 01:45:08,501
Excuse me, sir, but there's a gentleman here
that wants to talk to you.

1528
01:45:09,743 --> 01:45:12,735
- This is Mr. Wendell Craig, sir.
- How do you do?

1529
01:45:12,913 --> 01:45:15,711
He wanted to talk to you.
Isn't that right, Mr. Craig?

1530
01:45:15,883 --> 01:45:16,907
Yes, indeed.

1531
01:45:17,084 --> 01:45:19,780
Admiral, you don't mind
if I keep these glasses on, do you?

1532
01:45:19,953 --> 01:45:21,784
A little eye strain.

1533
01:45:21,955 --> 01:45:23,547
- Well?
- Go ahead, Mr. Craig.

1534
01:45:23,724 --> 01:45:25,589
The admiral is a busy man.

1535
01:45:25,759 --> 01:45:30,423
Yes. Well, admiral,
it seems as if I made a little mistake.

1536
01:45:30,898 --> 01:45:32,798
You know how things are.

1537
01:45:32,966 --> 01:45:36,766
You get a little excited, you think
you see things that aren't really there.

1538
01:45:36,937 --> 01:45:39,462
Just what wasn't where, Mr. Craig?

1539
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:43,269
Well, in the first place,
take that business in my hotel room.

1540
01:45:43,443 --> 01:45:47,675
Now that I come to think about it,
it wasn't even in my hotel room.

1541
01:45:47,848 --> 01:45:49,577
And about that girl...

1542
01:45:49,750 --> 01:45:51,479
You don't think
I'm the kind of man...

1543
01:45:51,652 --> 01:45:54,917
...that'd have a girl up
to my hotel room, do you? Ha-ha-ha.

1544
01:45:55,689 --> 01:46:00,251
That is, if it was in my hotel room,
which, of course, it wasn't.

1545
01:46:00,427 --> 01:46:04,830
- See what I mean?
- Vaguely. Very vaguely.

1546
01:46:04,998 --> 01:46:07,296
Mr. Craig isn't quite finished yet,
admiral.

1547
01:46:07,467 --> 01:46:09,298
- Oh?
- Are you, Mr. Craig?

1548
01:46:09,469 --> 01:46:11,403
Oh! Oh, no, of course not.

1549
01:46:11,572 --> 01:46:13,540
About those three sailors...

1550
01:46:13,707 --> 01:46:16,107
You see, admiral,
this play that I'm appearing in...

1551
01:46:16,276 --> 01:46:19,837
...is so full of sailors,
I'm beginning to think everyone's a sailor.

1552
01:46:20,013 --> 01:46:23,847
Actually, those three sailors
were three soldiers.

1553
01:46:24,017 --> 01:46:28,420
So you see, if nothing happened,
there's no point in filing charges.

1554
01:46:28,589 --> 01:46:31,649
Uh, you mean you wish
to withdraw the charges?

1555
01:46:31,825 --> 01:46:35,386
Oh, absolutely. Yes, indeed. Definitely.
Without a doubt.

1556
01:46:35,562 --> 01:46:38,929
Why, I don't wanna make any trouble
for the Navy.

1557
01:46:39,099 --> 01:46:42,466
The, uh, Navy appreciates
your attitude, Mr. Craig.

1558
01:46:42,636 --> 01:46:45,571
Mr. Craig wants to get to the base
to withdraw the charge, sir.

1559
01:46:45,739 --> 01:46:50,267
Yes, I do, and the sooner the better.
Well, good day, sir.

1560
01:46:50,444 --> 01:46:53,379
I'll drive you over, Mr. Craig.
I wouldn't want you to get lost.

1561
01:46:53,547 --> 01:46:55,742
- With the admiral's permission, sir.
- Of course.

1562
01:46:55,916 --> 01:46:58,714
We certainly wouldn't want
Mr. Craig to get lost.

1563
01:46:59,753 --> 01:47:03,086
- Uh, Mr. Jackson?
- Yes, sir.

1564
01:47:04,224 --> 01:47:07,751
What caused this sudden change?
There were no threats, no violence, huh?

1565
01:47:07,928 --> 01:47:11,159
Oh, no, sir. I just called on Mr. Craig
to discuss the wedding.

1566
01:47:11,331 --> 01:47:13,128
Wedding? What wedding?

1567
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:14,961
After what happened, sir,
I thought...

1568
01:47:15,135 --> 01:47:19,037
But nothing happened. I've spoken
to Susan. Absolutely nothing happened.

1569
01:47:19,206 --> 01:47:22,403
Of course. But you know how
the newspapers would write up this story.

1570
01:47:22,576 --> 01:47:24,703
It'd be better if Susan and Craig
were married.

1571
01:47:24,878 --> 01:47:28,177
Married. I don't want Susan
marrying that Craig.

1572
01:47:28,348 --> 01:47:31,613
Mr. Craig didn't think his wife
would like it, either, sir.

1573
01:47:36,890 --> 01:47:39,222
Oh, Mr. Jackson?

1574
01:47:39,393 --> 01:47:41,020
Yes, sir?

1575
01:47:41,728 --> 01:47:44,788
Thank you very much.

1576
01:47:45,465 --> 01:47:47,262
Yes, sir.
