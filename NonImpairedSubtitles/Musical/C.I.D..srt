1
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,821
Hello, listen, it's me.

2
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:28,826
The boss says he had
better come around.

3
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,829
He better be kept silent.

4
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:36,834
If he won't be paid off...

5
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:39,837
...then use
another method, get it?

6
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,858
It's me.

7
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,861
Get him out of the way!

8
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:07,865
If need be, pay him. Or else,
have him removed. All right?

9
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,025
Take this to printing room.

10
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,032
Who's calling?

11
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:58,035
Remember the man who has
been very good to you?

12
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,039
I've made my
decision very clear.

13
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:05,042
We must know if you'll
see our point of view.

14
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:08,045
My newspaper
always prints the truth.

15
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:10,047
Is that your last word?

16
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:15,052
Yes! Neither money nor threat
will make me change my mind.

17
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,083
Inspector Shekhar, please.

18
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,094
A call from Bombay Times office.

19
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:02,099
I'm coming. Here...

20
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:10,107
Constable, I've been here
all day. My feet are aching.

21
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,110
Please be patient.
- How can I be?

22
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,114
Sir, I've been robbed.

23
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,116
What is it?
- Sir, he's gone.

24
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:23,120
Who are you talking about?
- He's vanished again.

25
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:27,124
Can you tell me his name?
- Oh Lord! What can I say?

26
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,128
How can I tell you his name?

27
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:37,134
It's like a ball that sinks.
- You mean the moon?

28
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:43,141
No, not the moon. It sparkles.
- Star? You mean. Tarachand?

29
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,143
Ramsingh, look after the case!

30
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:52,149
I've told you a thousand
times go to the police station.

31
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:58,155
I've been there so often, that
I'm exhausted. I won't go again.

32
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:06,163
I'll tell the superintendent,
the commissioner.

33
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:10,167
I'll lodge a complaint, I'll
write to the home minister.

34
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,170
You call me every day, you cross
examine me.

35
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:19,176
Look into my eyes. Do
I look like a thief?

36
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,178
We'll have to find out.

37
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,191
Mr. Srivastav, what made
you think of me today?

38
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:38,195
I needed help so
I thought of you.

39
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,197
Police help? How can we...?

40
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:44,201
Someone is
threatening to kill me.

41
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:48,205
Who is it? - Someone.
It'd help if you came over.

42
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,213
What's new, Inspector?
Any murder, any robbery?

43
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:59,216
Mr. Banerjee. This is the
C.I.D. Office not a news agency.

44
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,224
I know. You realize that as a
reporter, I must make public...

45
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,227
Don't bother me!

46
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,237
Give this for typesetting.

47
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,305
What is it?

48
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,312
Who are you? What do you want?

49
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,409
Who was he?

50
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:18,415
Phone the hospital! The police!

51
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:25,422
Where's the fellow who
was standing near the lift?

52
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:32,429
There's been a murder at
the Bombay Times office...

53
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,466
Follow that car!
- Why? Who are you?

54
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:12,469
I'm a C.I. D officer.
We've got to follow that car.

55
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,471
I don't need to.

56
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,476
Then I will.

57
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,501
Stop the car. I
said, stop the car!

58
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,505
Can you see it?

59
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,509
What do I care?

60
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:56,513
There's a killer escaping. Let
me get him. I'll return the car...

61
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,515
...with thanks.

62
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:01,518
Before you arrest him,
I'll have you arrested.

63
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,521
I've told you, I'm
a C.I. D officer.

64
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,524
You look more like murderer.

65
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:26,543
Is that car following us?
- It looks like it.

66
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,546
Drive faster!

67
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,550
You won't catch up with them.

68
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:36,553
Don't worry. I'll
overtake them as soon as I can.

69
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:57,574
If you're a gentleman,
you'll get me home at once.

70
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,578
I assure you. I'll take
you home, safe and around.

71
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,620
Are we to follow them all night?

72
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,623
I won't stop
until I've got them.

73
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,644
Drive faster!

74
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,669
Look, the car stopped.
They've pulled over.

75
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,675
Check the license plate!

76
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,678
What is it? Give me the key.

77
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,682
The key!

78
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,694
Do you realize that murderer
has got away because of you?

79
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,699
If you want to get home,
you'll have to search for the keys.

80
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,703
In this rain?

81
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,706
If you don't want to
get wet, then sit here.

82
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,737
I can't find them.

83
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,743
I'm off. I'll go
and look for help.

84
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,748
Wait!

85
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,751
I'll be all alone.

86
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,756
Aren't you afraid of me?

87
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:06,763
All right. Sit in the back.
We'll look for the keys later.

88
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:26,783
Are you cold?

89
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:52,869
Why not guess my name? I
live by the bank of the river.

90
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:56,873
In my yard, swaying fig tree
spreads its cool shadow over me.

91
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,903
People call me crazy, as
my hair flies the breeze.

92
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,612
A black mole enhances my beauty.
My face is as fair as could be.

93
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,622
On the winding streets I
wander, young men stare in stupor.

94
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,661
Be careful today,
when you look my way.

95
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:33,670
As you gaze at my hair,
you'll be caught in a snare.

96
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:44,681
Whenever I walk,
I gather hearts.

97
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:23,720
Those who have heart to
lose, I am a women of ill repute.

98
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:32,729
I am a mystery, that is my
fame, but why not guess my name?

99
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:42,739
It's time to go. Will you
ask me where I'll travel?

100
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:35,792
What is it?
- Police.

101
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:44,801
Where were you at that time? -
I was at the press. He sent me.

102
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,805
He sent you there?

103
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,811
Who else was there?
- I believe...

104
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,814
Who else was there?

105
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,816
No one. The editor was alone.

106
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,819
The morning shift had left.
The night shift hadn't come.

107
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,829
Was the phone in this position?

108
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,832
Any fingerprints?
- I'm checking.

109
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,840
He may not survive.

110
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:29,846
Made any arrests?
- We're holding someone.

111
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,858
Weren't you following a lead?

112
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:47,864
Any conclusions?

113
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:50,867
Who are you?
- The sub editor.

114
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,883
Did the editor smoke?
- No, nor did he eat paan.

115
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,912
Your name?
- Master.

116
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:40,917
Occupation?
- I'm a cutter- tailor.

117
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,921
I cut coats and trousers.

118
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,924
If I need money, I'm
known to cut pockets, too.

119
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:51,928
Why were you at the office?

120
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,931
My stomach and brain are empty.

121
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,935
With some tea, my
brain will start working.

122
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,938
Shut up! I'll set
your brain right.

123
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,944
Why were you there?
- To place an advertisement.

124
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,948
An advertisement? What for?
- For a bride.

125
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,952
For whom?

126
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:21,958
Don't you understand?
- Be quiet!

127
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,962
A bride for me.
- You fool!

128
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,968
Whose marriage?
- Who is she?

129
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,970
She was my wife to be.

130
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,973
I mean, she is my wife to be.

131
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,975
Then why place an advertisement?

132
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,980
The advertisement
was to look for work.

133
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,984
To her it's work, and
to me it's marriage?

134
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:49,986
She's the one I'll
marry. I'll work anywhere.

135
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:53,990
You talk to me of
marriage, and to her of work.

136
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:58,995
What do you mean?
Aren't you ashamed?

137
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:02,999
You told me you'll marry
me. Who is this other girl?

138
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,003
Do you both want to
be put in the lock-up?

139
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,005
Sorry, Inspector.
This man is insane.

140
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:14,010
This isn't your home.
Now, what do you want?

141
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,013
To stand bail.
- Impossible!

142
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,016
It's a murder charge
- Murder?

143
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,024
Constable, take her away.

144
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:41,037
I'm glad you've come.
- What are you doing here?

145
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:44,040
He was found at the
scene of the crime.

146
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:50,046
You know me very well.
Help me. He doesn't know me.

147
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,049
Why were you at the
Bombay Times office?

148
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:56,052
Someone did his job before I...

149
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,054
What nonsense?

150
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:01,057
I haven't done
anything. I'm innocent.

151
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,062
I've spent all my life
cutting clothes, never throats.

152
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,065
Did you see who did it?
- Of course!

153
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,067
I saw him go in
and come out again.

154
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:17,073
He had eyes as big as a 100
watt bulb. Built like a wrestler.

155
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,075
I was trembling with fear.

156
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:23,079
Can you identify him? - I
Can identify his entire clan.

157
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:30,086
You can leave
- Really?

158
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:34,090
Stop pickpocketing or
you'll be in for life.

159
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:46,102
He's a mere pickpocket.
I know him very well.

160
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,106
But keep an eye on him.

161
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:10,126
O gentle heart... life
is an uphill struggle...

162
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:13,129
Be alert, be street wise.
This is my Bombay, my friend.

163
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:47,163
There are buildings and
trams, and motorcars and mills.

164
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:52,168
There is everything to be
had, except a heart's thrills.

165
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,181
There's not a trace of
humanity in this bustling city.

166
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:36,212
Some play numbers, some
go to races, others thieve.

167
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:40,216
Some starve, some suffer
insults, others grieve.

168
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:53,229
Yet the idle manage to
make both ends meet.

169
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:23,259
Here, vagabond is
another name for homeless.

170
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:27,263
While others cut throats
and that's called business.

171
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,276
It may be the same game, but
it goes under many a name.

172
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:11,307
You called the world unfair,
don't be so naive, beware.

173
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:16,312
You will reap what you sow
that's the name of the game.

174
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:30,326
Flexing your muscles
won't make old Bombay tame.

175
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,361
Any news?

176
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:11,367
You're right. Sir, there is
hashish mixed in this tobacco.

177
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:16,372
Get me the file on the
criminals who deal in narcotics.

178
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,380
Did you find anything out?
- No, nothing.

179
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:27,383
I'm hoping when
Srivastav regains consciousness...

180
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:31,387
I am sorry, Shekhar...

181
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:35,391
...the hospital phoned
that Shrivastav is dead.

182
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,395
Why would anyone want to
kill such a noble man?

183
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,399
Bad news.

184
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:48,404
I'm sure there are at
least two people involved.

185
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:55,411
One who committed the crime,
the other who engineered it.

186
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,416
Is this a doubt, or...?
- Here. Have a look.

187
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,421
Srivastav sent this article
just before he was attacked.

188
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:09,425
He was about to
expose someone important...

189
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:15,431
...but he was killed before
he could accomplish that.

190
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:24,440
Have you found any clues?
- A cigarette.

191
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:32,448
4 million people live
here, at least million smoke.

192
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:36,452
Those who smoke hashish can
be counted among thousands.

193
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,480
Here's our man.

194
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,484
Bring him to me!

195
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,561
Ibrahim, let's have another
- All right, then.

196
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:48,584
How are things
with you, Shersingh?

197
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:55,591
Who's he?
- A friend.

198
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:59,595
Here...
- A cigarette?

199
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,600
I don't like his face.

200
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:08,604
Your name?

201
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,609
Editor Srivastav.

202
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,634
Who picked my pocket?

203
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:40,636
Lost much?
- 8 annas.

204
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,640
Take the packet. Pay me later.

205
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:52,648
A packet of Peela
Haathi and a paan.

206
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:55,651
Posing as a millionaire
without a penny!

207
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:59,655
That's the trouble. You
think I'm good for nothing.

208
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,659
So you picked his pocket?

209
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:09,665
Here's 8 annas. Fill the
paan with my unrequited love.

210
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:19,675
It's a counterfeit.
- Counterfeit?

211
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:24,680
Poison disguised as
nectar! What's going on?

212
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,684
To the police station!

213
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,686
Why?
- You'll see.

214
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,688
Here's 8 annas, tell me now.

215
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,691
Join the police. You
visit them each day.

216
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:38,694
There'll be no need to
have a police force.

217
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,697
If there are no thieves,
there won't be any thefts.

218
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,702
You'll go hungry.

219
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:50,706
Why are you taking
me? I'm innocent.

220
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:56,712
Then why? It's not on
a murder charge, is it?

221
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,717
Inspector Shekhar
knows it. I didn't do it.

222
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,720
He'll be there. You tell him.

223
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:10,726
My love, caress my
neck for the last time...

224
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,729
...it's heading
straight for the noose.

225
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,733
You've been called to
identify the killer.

226
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,736
You've got him? Let's go.

227
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,742
Wait! Is he securely bound?

228
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:31,747
I'm not scared. But I don't
get on well with cutthroats.

229
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:49,765
Well? Will you be able
to identify the murder?

230
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:51,767
At once!
- Scared?

231
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,771
Scared? Me? I
have a lion's heart.

232
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,775
Who is the man you saw at
the Bombay Times office?

233
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,788
Identify him!

234
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:38,814
If looks could kill, I'd be...

235
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:42,818
Don't worry. We're with
you. Tell us who he is.

236
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,821
Point him out. Which one?
- That one.

237
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,823
Speak up!

238
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:51,826
Black coat!

239
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,830
It wasn't me. He's
lying. I'll fix you.

240
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:59,835
Take him away! You may leave.

241
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,842
Skekhar, wake up!

242
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:03,018
Enchanted my first love,
eyes filled with sweet dreams.

243
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,022
From the realm of
magic, appeared a magician.

244
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:44,059
A cloud of fine hair
blows over your face.

245
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:49,064
Don't walk away,
turn around and stay.

246
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:03,078
He stands at your door,
eyes filled with sweet dreams.

247
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:34,109
Your eyes may
flash with anger now...

248
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:39,114
...but cupid's bow
will smooth your brow.

249
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:53,128
You'll soon surrender
under the magician's spell.

250
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:24,159
Hearing you talk, she
begins to break into smile.

251
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:29,164
See how the laughter
gathers at her lips.

252
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:43,178
Despite herself, her face
reveals her love, anger veils.

253
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,182
From the realm of
magic, appeared a magician.

254
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:16,211
If you value your life, go away.

255
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:22,217
Take another step,
and you go to jail.

256
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:26,221
This is the S.P.'s home.
- I know. I'm here to see him.

257
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:30,225
The call of death
is irresistible.

258
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:32,227
Come in. I'll take care of you.

259
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:36,230
After you.

260
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:50,245
You're so impolite.

261
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,267
Making yourself at home, eh?

262
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,271
May I have a glass of water?

263
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:20,275
You'll even get
lemonade. Let father come.

264
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:22,277
Yes, my father.
- Your...?

265
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:30,285
Father, see...
- What is it?

266
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:33,288
That man's here again.
- What man?

267
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,290
The man who took my car.
- Where is he?

268
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:37,292
He is sitting there.

269
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:43,298
First, it was the car.
Now, he's followed me in.

270
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:47,302
Do you mean him?
- Yes.

271
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:00,315
My daughter Rekha.
- Delighted to meet you.

272
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,320
Rekha has a bone
to pick with you.

273
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:10,325
I needed a car to follow a
suspect. I had no choice.

274
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,330
Excuse me, please.

275
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:21,336
Instead of lemonade,
may I have some water?

276
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:23,338
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

277
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:29,344
The mistake was fortunate or
else how would we have met?

278
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:41,356
Since when did you know him?

279
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:53,368
What did you have against
him? Why did you kill him?

280
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:02,377
Silence won't save
you from hanging.

281
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:11,386
At 8.07, you entered
the Bombay Times office...

282
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,389
...at 8.10 Srivastav was killed.

283
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:20,395
At 8.12 you left the office,
at 8.14 I saw near the lift.

284
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:27,402
Fool! Death is as close to
you as this chair before you.

285
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:30,406
A call for you, sir.

286
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:34,409
Srivastav didn't hurt a
fly. He was a noble man...

287
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:38,413
...and you killed
him. You'll pay.

288
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:44,419
Sooner or later, you'll tell us
why you killed him, understood?

289
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:57,432
Who is it?
- We've never met.

290
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:01,436
Your name?
- I can't tell you.

291
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:06,441
Can I be of help?
- Actually, I can help you.

292
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,443
Help me?
- Yes.

293
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:14,449
I have some information
about Srivastav's murder...

294
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,451
...which will most
probably fascinate you.

295
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:20,455
Come over then.
- I can't

296
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:25,460
You'll have to come to see me.
- Where are you?

297
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:28,463
You must come here.
- But how?

298
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:33,468
My car is parked in
front of your office.

299
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:38,473
License plate BMZ 1454.

300
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:42,477
Get into the car. My
driver will bring you.

301
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:03,498
Are you here for me?
- Yes. Sit down.

302
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:18,513
So you prefer tinted glass?

303
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:23,518
Don't you find it too dark?
- I'm used to it.

304
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:42,537
Some cool breeze preferably?
- I'm not used to it.

305
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:47,542
Don't you find it stuffy?

306
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:53,548
It's dangerous for us
to be seen together.

307
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:02,557
Where are we going?
- You'll see.

308
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:12,687
Do sit down.

309
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:21,696
What can you tell me
about the murder case?

310
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,701
Case? What case?

311
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:31,706
You told me you could shed
some light on the matter.

312
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:38,713
Shed light? I don't like light.

313
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:41,716
Why call me here?

314
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:45,720
I hear you like parrots.

315
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:48,723
Parrots?
- Yes parrots.

316
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:55,730
I suppose I do. What about you?

317
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:58,733
Only one kind... a mute one.

318
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:02,737
They're worthless.
They won't fetch 4 annas.

319
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:05,740
Name your price. I'll pay well.

320
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:09,744
A thousand, two
thousand, five thousand.

321
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,747
You own such a parrot.
- No.

322
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:15,750
The one I own is a chatterbox.

323
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:18,753
A new parrot entered
your cave recently.

324
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:21,756
You've tried hard
to make him talk...

325
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:23,758
So far he hasn't.

326
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:29,764
That one?
- Yes.

327
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:31,766
So you understand me now.

328
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:37,772
I'll pay any price you
want. 10,000, 20,000, 50,000.

329
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:43,778
Is it a deal?
- Find yourself another parrot.

330
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,783
I won't sell.
Bribing is an offence.

331
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:53,788
A bribe? I'm not bribing anyone.

332
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:56,791
If you won't sell, then don't.

333
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:02,797
Why get angry?
- I'll have you arrested.

334
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:04,799
Go ahead, Inspector.

335
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:16,811
He refuses to sell.

336
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:20,815
How high did you bid?
What was your offer, 50,000?

337
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:24,819
He refused.
- He's left?

338
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,822
He's here, unconscious.

339
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:31,826
Good. Have him dumped.
- Where?

340
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:34,829
On The Bombay Agra road.

341
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:40,835
He mustn't know
where he was. Be careful!

342
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:19,874
Rekha! It's you?

343
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:24,879
How did I get here?
- You were brought here.

344
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:28,883
You were lying unconscious
on the Bombay Agra road.

345
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:32,887
What's happening?

346
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:39,894
Your friends are waiting.

347
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:44,899
Do you feel better?
- Much better, sir.

348
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:49,904
I'm sorry to bother,
coming here in this state.

349
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:52,907
Regard this as your
home. But what happened?

350
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:58,913
I was following a lead
on the Srivastav case.

351
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:02,917
I was offered a drink and then...

352
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,921
It can wait. We'll talk later.

353
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:10,925
It's Rekha's birthday.
Freshen up and come down.

354
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:30,945
Happy birthday!

355
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:33,948
Where were you?
- I am here now. Some cake?

356
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,950
You won't get it.

357
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:40,955
Here, have it.
- No, thanks.

358
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:44,959
Why? You will have to.

359
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:54,969
I fast on Tuesdays.
- It is only fruit, Dharamdasji.

360
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:58,973
I don't touch fruit, either.
- Such principles!

361
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:04,979
You are opening a hospital?
- It's my duty to serve.

362
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:07,982
You are a benevolent man.

363
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:13,988
Meet Mr. Dharamdas, a well
- known citizen of Bombay.

364
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:18,993
Pleased to meet you.
He helps everyone.

365
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:22,997
Just today, he donated Rs.
5,000 to Srivastav's family.

366
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,000
Don't embarrass me, Mr. Mathur.

367
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:31,005
Have you made any
progress on Srivastav's case?

368
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:35,009
It's his case, ask him.
- Well...

369
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:57,031
I haven't seen you for ages
- It's been four years.

370
00:58:57,133 --> 00:59:01,035
Four years! They've
flown by like four days.

371
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:05,039
You're lucky to think of
four years as four days.

372
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:10,044
I have so much to
talk to you about.

373
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:15,049
I must leave.
- Already?

374
00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:24,058
Come along, Kamini.
- No, I must leave.

375
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:30,064
Srivastav's case...?
- Nothing so far.

376
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:36,069
Excuse me.

377
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:39,073
Where have you been?

378
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:44,078
You look pale.
- Trouble with income tax?

379
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,140
Kamini, meet Inspector Shekhar.

380
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:52,146
Pleased to meet you.
- For the second time.

381
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:55,149
The second time?
- Yes.

382
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:57,151
Then, you were after a parrot.

383
01:00:57,253 --> 01:01:00,154
A parrot?
- You offered 50,000.

384
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:03,157
I'm serious.

385
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:07,161
What's wrong with you?

386
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:12,167
Come on, let's go.

387
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:29,183
She's the same girl.
- She's a close friend.

388
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:32,186
I'm leaving, Rekha.
- Why the hurry?

389
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:34,188
It's quite late. Bye!

390
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:53,207
What are you doing here?
- Rekha asked me over.

391
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:56,210
How long have you known her?
- We are childhood friends.

392
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:59,213
We've no friends here.

393
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:05,219
They're all police officers.
They can send you to your death.

394
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:09,223
Did Shekhar
realize who you were?

395
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:12,226
I fooled him...

396
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:15,229
...but I think he
suspects something.

397
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:19,233
Leave the city before his
suspicions are confirmed.

398
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:23,237
Keep clear of the C.I.D.

399
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:26,207
You're leaving?
- Yes I have some work.

400
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:28,209
We'll meet again?
- Yes.

401
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:51,232
Where are you going?

402
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:54,235
I have some urgent work.
- I know.

403
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:56,237
You'll follow her though.
I've told you she's a friend.

404
01:03:00,343 --> 01:03:03,244
Don't follow her.
- I won't. I have work.

405
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:05,245
Do you, really?

406
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,250
I don't care.

407
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:13,254
If you leave now, I'll
never talk to you again.
