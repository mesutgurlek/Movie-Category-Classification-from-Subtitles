But it's still alive.

28
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,882
The old woman begins to move.

29
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,527
The old woman gets up.

30
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,087
The old woman's stomach growls.

31
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,642
Old woman, old woman.

32
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,041
Old woman, old woman.
Old woman, old woman.

00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,681
Old woman, old woman.

34
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,922
The old woman thinks.

35
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,567
Thinks on an empty stomach.

36
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,327
Thinks of what to do.

37
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,881
Thinks with her limited mind.

38
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,561
Thinks with her dirty mind.

39
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,968
Old woman, old woman.

40
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,481
Old woman, old woman.
Old woman, old woman.

41
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,126
Back to work.

42
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,121
Yes, sir.

43
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,887
Do not swim.

44
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,684
Hang in there, little one.

45
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,008
Yikes, almost dropped you.

46
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,564
We”re almost there, okay?
Oh no!

47
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,091
That was close.

48
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,410
Oh, this way.

49
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,523
Hey.

50
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,727
A kappa.

51
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,407
A kappa!

52
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,331
Lt”s a kappa, a kappa!

53
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,284
Hey, I saw a kappa!

54
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,082
I said I saw a kappa!

55
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,130
A kappa, everyone!

56
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,087
I really did.

57
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,481
Over here.

58
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,647
Hurry.

59
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,965
What's happening?

60
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,528
I saw m y first kappa!

61
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,961
This way.

62
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,366
I don't see it.

63
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,726
I swear I saw it.

64
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,167
It was here.

65
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,443
Where is it?

66
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,603
Maybe over here?

67
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,087
Where is it?

68
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,727
Kappa! Come out, kappa!

69
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,451
That”s strange, I know I saw it.

70
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,521
Kappa! Where are you?

71
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,082
-Asuka.
- Yeah?

72
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,843
Can I announce our engagement?

73
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,527
Sure.

74
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,646
Really?

75
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,487
Thanks.

76
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,886
What?

77
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,006
Can I kiss you?

78
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,601
Sure.

79
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,765
There”s no kappa.

80
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,246
Just them kissing.

81
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,087
Tongue and all.

82
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,807
Hey.

83
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,290
What do you want?

84
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,688
Lt”s me, Tetsuya Aoki.
Remember?

85
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,687
Aoki?

86
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,326
Longtime no see.

87
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,771
Why are you a kappa?

88
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,649
I died and became a kappa.

89
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,810
I remember, you died in high school.

90
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,286
You drowned in the swamp.

91
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,488
That was you, right?

92
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,767
That”s me.

93
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,566
Why are you a kappa?
No, wait...

94
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,406
Why”s a dead person alive?
No, wait...

95
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,610
This doesn't make any sense.

96
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,681
Lt”s normal, Chage.

97
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,047
That”s my nickname.

98
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,445
Been a while, Chage.

99
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,444
So you really are a kappa.

100
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,009
Yeah, I need water.

101
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,724
How long ago was it that you drowned?

102
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,766
I don't remember.

103
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,688
We were high school seniors,
so 17 years ago?

104
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,764
Been that long, huh?

105
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,240
Yeah.

106
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,570
You haven”t changed.

107
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,844
I'm an old woman now.

108
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,050
No, you”re not.

109
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,770
What brings you here?

110
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,249
Stuff.

111
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,930
What stuff?

112
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,686
You know, stuff.

113
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,287
Asuka!

114
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,161
It's me.

115
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,770
Hide here, okay?

116
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,001
Uh, sure.

117
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,448
I'm here.

118
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,604
Not today.

119
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,642
Why not?

120
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,564
I have to watch some TV

121
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,046
Let”s watch together.

122
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,404
I have to think alone.

123
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,526
Something happened?

124
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,646
No, nothing.

125
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,966
I'm already here.
Let”s plan the wedding.

126
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,367
Right...

127
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,087
Asuka.

128
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,249
No, not today.

129
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,010
C'mon, why not?

130
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,002
No.

131
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,124
Won 'l lake long.
Think all you want later.

132
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,527
OW.

133
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,687
What was that?

134
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,720
It was nothing.

135
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,327
Take it off.

136
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,047
Wow.

137
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,601
Asuka.

138
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,922
Yes!

139
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,567
You”re amazing.

140
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,680
You're amazing, Asuka.

141
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,362
Here.

142
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,366
Thanks.

143
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,721
I'm taking a bath.

144
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,129
Wait, don't go there.

145
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,007
Hey, what”s wrong?

146
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,005
I'm getting horny again.

147
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,367
Boyfriend?

148
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,810
Yeah, we”re getting married.

149
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,488
Huh, good for you.

150
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,685
Aoki, have you been
a kappa ever since you drowned?

151
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,523
Yeah.

152
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,571
Whats it like?

153
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,249
Not all that different.

154
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,205
I eat fish until I'm full,
go to sleep,

155
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,290
wake up in the morning.

156
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,360
I see.

157
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,730
I manage all right.

158
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,728
I'm glad you”re alive.

159
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,201
Let me stay tonight.

160
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,329
What?

161
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,443
I want to live here a while.

162
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,050
You can't.
Hajime comes here sometimes,

163
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,881
and the villagers might see you.

164
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,166
I know, but c'mon, please?

165
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,965
No, go back to your swamp.

166
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,686
C'mon.

167
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,929
That”s where you live, right?

168
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,804
I just got here.
Let”s have some more fun.

169
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,521
No, I've got stuff to do.

170
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,289
I have to plan the wedding

171
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,449

172
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,282

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,401
Let”s play.

175
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,006
No.

176
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,686
Let”s play, Chage.

177
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,966
No. What do you mean, "play"?

178
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,845
Like sing or dance.

179
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,970
Or eat fish or swim, whatever.

180
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,091
I know, let”s do sumo

181
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,367
That”s stupid.

182
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,566
What”s stupid?

183
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,520
I mean, you”re not a kid anymore.

184
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,484
Aoki, why are you here?

185
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,690
C'mon, let”s play.

186
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,122
I said no.

187
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,324
Fine then, stupid Chage.

188
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,681
Just like this.
Just like this.

189
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:27,248
Just like this.
Forever and ever.

190
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:33,847
Just by hoping.
As sincere! y as I can.

191
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:42,761
Just by wishing.
As intensely as I can.

192
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,167
Everything will work out fine.

193
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,885
Even after I die.
Even after you die.

194
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,525
Even after the stars die.
Forever and ever.

195
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,841
Somewhere out there.

196
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,850
In some place we've never been.

197
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,520
This moment will live on.

198
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:35,480
Just like this.
Just like this.

199
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:44,167
Just like this.
Forever and ever.

200
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:50,880
Just by hoping.
As sincere! y as I can.

201
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:59,607
Just by wishing.
As intensely as I can.

202
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,691
Listen up, everyone.

203
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,730
This is Aoki,
who”ll be joining us part-time.

204
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,486
Hi, I'm Aoki.

205
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,291
He has a condition
that makes him sensitive to sunlight.

206
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,042
But he promises to work hard here.

207
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,964
So please welcome him.

208
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,683
Kawaguchi.

209
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,208
Yes?

210
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,248
Show him the ropes.

211
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,083
Yes, sir.

212
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,724
I appreciate it.

213
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,765
Are you crazy?

214
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,526
What”s the big deal?

215
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,451
Go home to your swamp.

216
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,887
Nope.

217
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,006
You shouldn't have come here.

218
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,126
Oh, be quiet.

219
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,489
Getting smart on me?
Go home, go home!

220
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,086
Cut it out, it”s cold.

221
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:16,007
Kappa need water, right?
I'll pour some on your head.

222
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,764
Does that feel good?

223
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,809
Hey, cut it out.

224
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,890
You got me wet now!

225
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,609
Take this, you kappa!
You want water, right?

226
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,007
What?

227
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,481
Let”s go home together.

228
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,161
I have a date, so don”t follow me.

229
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,727
Huh.

230
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,085
I'm serious, don't.

231
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,881
Fine, whatever.

232
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,047
Chage.

233
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,370
I'm going to protect you.

234
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,247
Idiot.

235
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,726
Rejected, huh?

236
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,126
Poor thing.

237
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,487
Shall we?

238
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,771
Check this out, and then this,

239
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,686
and then this.

240
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,007
Cool, huh?

241
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,289
I'm getting excited
looking at these brochures.

242
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,407
We're really getting married.
isn't that amazing?

243
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,847
Sure is.

244
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,805
I think I'm gonna cry.

245
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:08,608
Look, they still have gondolas!
Wanna ride one of these?

246
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,442
Sure.

247
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,449
What”s wrong? Let”s go in.

248
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,567
This is my house.

249
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,727
Liar! it's been abandoned for a while.

250
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,126
I used to live here.

251
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,926
Sure, sure.

252
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,970
My secret hideaway.

253
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,601
Where did everyone go?

254
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,367
The residents?

255
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,761
Tokyo, probably.

256
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,046
I'm saving up to go to Tokyo, too.

257
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,362
Here.

258
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,528
Thank you.

259
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,645
Got any money?

260
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,087
No.

261
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,121
Oh well, first one”s free, then.

262
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,123
What's wrong? Take 'em off.

263
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,326
Yes, ma'am.

264
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,009
Hey, you”re a kappa.

265
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,281
Sorry.

266
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,361
Wow, I haven”t seen
a kappa since I was a kid.

267
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,367
Okay, let”s do it.

268
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,607
Are you sure?

269
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,368
Yeah.

270
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,801
Okay, then.

271
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,807
Come here.

272
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,646
Pardon, excuse me.

273
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,885
Where”re you going?

274
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,681
Sorry, I have to go somewhere.

275
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,168
But we have lots to decide.

276
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,129
I'm so sorry! Next time.

277
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,691
I used to play with kappa.

278
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,530
We'd play doctor and stuff.

279
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,240
Wait, is this your first time?

280
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,841
I'm sorry.

281
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,728
Okay, just leave it to me.

282
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,605
Hard to kiss.

283
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,247
Touch me.

284
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,126
This one, too.

285
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,128
Wow, they're amazing.

286
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,321
They”re soft.

287
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,729
Wow, they're so big.

288
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,561
Just like that.

289
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,011
Feels amazing.

290
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,690
Oh my god, it's huge.

291
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,365
Oh, yes.

292
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,244
Oh, yes.

293
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,762
Feels great.

294
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,241
I'm putting it in.

295
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,329
Yes, please.

296
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,322
Lt”s in.

297
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,368
Oh my god.

298
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,771
Oh my god, you feel good.

299
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,047
Feels good?

300
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,123
Yes, feels great.

301
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,807
Come here.

302
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,647
I'm coming.

303
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,163
You”re amazing.
Kappa are sure something.

304
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,084
Why, thank you.

305
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,801
Are you here?

306
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,207
Aoki.

307
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,606
Aoki, where are you?
Hey!

308
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,326
Where is he?

309
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,168
C'mon, kappa, come on out.

310
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,011
Hey!

311
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,725
Aoki!

312
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,886
Come on out!

313
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,681
Hey!

314
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,640
Boo.

315
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,088
Something good is coming.

316
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,162
If I wait for it.
it'll come.

317
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:56,802
Something so good
There are now words for it.

318
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:03,321
Something so fleeting.
it'll disappear it you touch it.

319
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:12,923
it'll appear before me.
I know it.

320
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,522
I don? understand at all.

321
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,007
I 7/ stay one night.
So let me drink some water.

322
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,922
I $11 hungry now.

323
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,003
So let's eat.
So let's eat.

324
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,966
What? good is gluttony.
I 7/ eat anything.

325
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,125
The can itself.
The bottle itself.

326
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,768
Things that taste terrible.
Things that are bad

327
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,241
Things I hate.
Things I hate.

328
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,287
Sadness, tears resentment.

329
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,602
Gluttony deliciously consumes it all.

330
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,642
Gluttony happily consumes ll all.

331
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:27,048
Gluttony gluttony.

332
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,122
Even eats the chipped plate itself.

333
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,488
Gluttony gluttony.

334
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,562
Now just let the gastric juices
work their course.

335
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:51,563
Now just let drowsiness
take its course.

336
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,962
And dive deep into a dream.

337
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,124
Deeper and deeper.

338
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,966
I need more time.

339
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,327
How long?

340
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,361
About 30 years.

341
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,010
Idiot, that defeats the point of a life span.

342
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,810
I'm sure there are other lives to take.

343
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,366
What can I do?
it's been decided.

344
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,286
I'm begging you. 20 years, then.

345
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,807
Nope.

346
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,009
Aoki, time to get back to work.

347
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,167
Here.

348
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,690
Hey, please, stop it.

349
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,970
Bukkake, bukkake!

350
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,566
Please, no. bukkake...

351
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,530
Pour it on my head.

352
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,847
Lt”s cold.

353
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,401
Hey, cut it out.

354
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,568
Hey.

355
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,409
It stopped.

356
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,840
Hey there.

357
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,327
What”s going on?

358
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,847
About what?

359
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,570
You and Aoki seem close.

360
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,882
Yeah?

361
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,447
Something”s up.

362
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,163
Not really.

363
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,009
What, do you like him?

364
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,847
Not especially.

365
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,171
Not especially what?

366
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,603
Actually,
I'm getting married to the boss.

367
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,287
To Hajime.

368
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,250
So getting married
means forgetting the past.

369
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,370
That”s not what I said.

370
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,324
Aoki was your classmate, right?

371
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,170
He told me.

372
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,926
He died, became a kappa,

373
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,086
and came all the way here.

374
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,209
Can't you be nicer to him?

375
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,447
You two are friends, aren”t you?

376
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,041
Mmm, yum.

377
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,762
So how”s it been for you?

378
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,407
What?

379
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,768
What”d you do after high school?

380
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,481
I went to Tokyo.

381
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,322
Yeah?

382
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,170
I worked at an office in Shimbashi.

383
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,721
That 's great.

384
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,084
It wasn't great at all.

385
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,051
It was just back and forth
between home and work,

386
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,122
nothing really interesting at all.

387
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,449
Then, ten years had passed.

388
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,201
My parents died so I came back.

389
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,922
I guess you”ve been
toughing it out, too.

390
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,525
Asuka, we have a problem.

391
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,285
I wanted to reserve
the hall today but...

392
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,726
Oh, hi boss.

393
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,121
What”re you doing here?

394
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,766
Uh...

395
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,321
What”s going on?

396
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,440
Aoki was my high school classmate,

397
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,810
and he drowned and became a kappa.

398
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,126
Think I'm stupid?

399
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,244
Lt”s true.

400
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,889
Did you guys... do it?

401
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,565
Lt”s not like that.

402
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,970
Take a good look. He”s a kappa, see?

403
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,250
Looks like one,
but ii”s just a condition.

404
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,603
What're we gonna do?
Are we getting married?

405
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,802
C'mon, answer me.

406
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,161
We are.

407
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,488
Right?

408
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,328
That means you”ve gotta go, now.

409
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,044
Don't come to work, either.

410
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,088
Are you fucking deaf, Aoki?

411
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,126
Shut up, you talk big for a human.

412
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,841
I've died and come back to life.

413
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,684
I'll tell you this.

414
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,441
I'll never lose to you.

415
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,522
Hey, kappa.

416
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,966
You again.
Better not get in my way.

417
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,811
Hey, come with me.

418
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,207
What for?

419
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,727
Let”s get a drink.

420
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,451
Ooh, sounds good.

421
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,481
Dam n, that”s good.

422
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,527
How long?

423
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:48,929
What?

424
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,688
How long will Chage live?

425
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,084
Sorry, can”t tell you that.

426
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,490
But I gave you sake.

427
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,330
Fine, then.

428
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,888
She has until sunset tomorrow.

429
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:16,561
When the sun goes down,
poof, she expires.

430
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,364
Cant you do something?

431
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,091
Lt”s been decided.

432
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,364
Damn, I'm drunk.

433
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,802
I'm off.

434
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,286
Don”t get any ideas.

435
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,486
I heard it all.

436
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,725
Asuka's going to die?

437
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,487
Don't worry.

438
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,407
I found this love letter
you wrote in the closet.

439
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,842
So you loved Asuka, huh?

440
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,722
Lt”s not too late.
You should tell her how you feel.

441
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,966
Once we”re married,

442
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,724
we”ll have sex like this everyday.

443
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,685
We”ll make babies, have a family,

444
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,486
our kids will grow up and have kids,

445
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,240
and their kids will have kids...

446
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,646
I know.

447
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,121
I know.

448
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,371
Hey, what the hell.

449
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,450
Hey, that”s cold. Stop it.

450
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,367
Got a moment?

451
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,445
Here she is.

452
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,167
Sorry.

453
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,207
What?

454
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,922
You only have until
Sundown today to live.

455
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,004
Huh? What”re you talking about?

456
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,641
Let”s run away.

457
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,721
Quit with the jokes already.

458
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,687
Chage.

459
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,046
What in the world is going on?

460
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,845
For once, just trust me.

461
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,887
I think that”s why I'm here.

462
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,762
I want to save you.

463
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,371
Don't bother,
it's already been decided.

464
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,321
Who”s this?

465
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,483
What the hell”s going on?

466
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,404
Great, look who”s here.
Hurry, go!

467
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,891
Aoki, what do you want?

468
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,288
Chage, let”s go.

469
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,846
If you go, the marriage is off!

470
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,082
Wherever you go, I'll find you.

471
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,647
Chage.

472
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,406
Enough already!

473
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,241
Run!

474
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,561
Almost tripped.

475
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,849
I've decided decided.
I 've made up my mind.

476
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,722
I've decided decided.
I 've made up my mind.

477
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,566
All that 's left.
Is to do it, to move.

478
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,723
wish for it.
And just do it.

479
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:18,329
Believe in it.
And go with the wind.

480
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:23,451
The water will carry me.

481
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:29,245
The water of happiness.
Proof of life.

482
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,202
Like a demon with a club.
It makes me stronger.

483
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,563
Don? trust the tears.

484
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,123
Walk forwards and you won? fall.

485
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:52,726
I've decided decided.
I 've made up my mind.

486
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,842
I've decided decided.
I 've made up my mind.

487
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,766
All that 's left.
Is to do it, to move.

488
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,883
wish for it.
And just do it.

489
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,643
Believe in it.
And go with the wind.

490
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,606
The water will carry me.

491
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,561
Where”re we going?

492
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,201
Into the mountains.

493
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,688
I see.

494
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,281
Am I going to die?

495
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,687
No.

496
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,640
My time”s up, it's set in stone.

497
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,807
We can change it.

498
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:05,922
You think so?

499
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,522
I'll change it.

500
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,604
Gotta embrace being human
and live as long as you can.

501
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,801
You”re right, I'll try my best.

502
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,208
Good.

503
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,367
I'm tired. How much further?

504
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,087
A ways to go.

505
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,690
Are you serious?

506
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,007
Hang in there.

507
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,130
I'm so exhausted.

508
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,568
Really exhausted.

509
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,491
Further?

510
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,405
Almost there.

511
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,080
I'm serious, I can't go on.

512
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,767
Watch for Vipers.

513
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,007
Here?

514
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,002
Yeah.

515
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,601
We made it! Yes!

516
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,962
Wow, look at this.

517
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,691
Long time no see, sir.

518
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,167
Been well?

519
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,206
I'm managing okay.

520
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,367
State your purpose.

521
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,045
I need the anal pearl.

522
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,930
To fool the God of Death?

523
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,527
Yes, sir.

524
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,841
Don”t, he”ll curse you.

525
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,441
I'm begging you.

526
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,009
Is she the one who”ll die?

527
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:58,128
She”s a very dear friend of mine.

528
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,449
Woman, how many years
have you lived?

529
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,531
35 years, sir.

530
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,002
You wish to live still?

531
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,486
Or do you not?

532
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,041
I want to live.

533
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,766
You”ll die eventually.

534
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:30,765
No matter now much you prolong it,
you only delay the inevitable.

535
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,283
I guess I'll die one day.

536
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,369
Resist all you want,
you”ll still die.

537
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,688
Do you still wish to live?

538
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,925
Yes, I want to live.

539
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,842
Tomorrow, the day after...
I want to live.

540
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,925
I might forget what happened today,

541
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,442
but I'll do my best to remember.

542
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,007
I'll be sure to remember it all.

543
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,285
Please, lend me the anal pearl.

544
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,806
- Woman.
- Yes?

545
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,487
Are you fertile?

546
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,170
Yes, probably.

547
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,367
Good luck.

548
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,728
Music, start!

549
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,966
I've decided decided.
I 've made up my mind.

550
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,051
I've decided.
I 've made up my mind.

551
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,441
I've decided decided.
I 've made up my mind.

552
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,731
I've decided.
I 've made up my mind.

553
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,842
Nothing good will ever happen.

554
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,129
I was a fool for believing.

555
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,767
I was naive for wishing.

556
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,208
kill, kill, beaf him FO deafh.

557
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,720
Beat that lying kappa to death.

558
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,485
kill, kill, beat him to deafh.

559
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:45,361
I've decided decided.
I 've made up my mind.

560
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,485
I've decided.
I 've made up my mind.

561
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,881
I've decided decided.
I 've made up my mind.

562
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,170
I've decided.
I 've made up my mind.

563
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,650
What do we do with this?

564
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,729
Wash it at the river
and shove it up your butt.

565
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,361
What! In my butthole?

566
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,368
Will this thing really lil?

567
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:50,609
You have to!
it'll ward off the God of Death.

568
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:13,967
What”s wrong?

569
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,685
My scalp is dry.
I can”t move anymore.

570
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,524
Oh c'mon, pull yourself together!

571
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,007
I'm sorry.

572
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,286
We”re almost there, let”s go.

573
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,203
Go on ahead and wash it.

574
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,368
What, by myself?

575
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,564
Hurry, the sun”s setting.

576
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,722
Fine, then.

577
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,643
Ran all the way here, huh?

578
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,771
What do you want with me?

579
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:40,161
Your time”s up.
Say goodbye to this world.

580
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:41,647
No.

581
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,850
You have no choice.

582
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,289
No means no.
I have a lot left to do.

583
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,202
Come.

584
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,211
How dare you!

585
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,321
We”re going.

586
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:06,046
I'm not going with you.
Now go get my anal pearl!

587
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:12,050
Do you realize I'm a God of Death?

588
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,241
So what?

589
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,805
Show your ass!

590
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,971
I'll give you a wedgie!

591
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:56,529
Yes!

592
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:14,720
There it is.

593
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:39,401
Don”t look!

594
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,727
Go away!

595
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:02,847
Water...

596
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,046
What”S with that bitch?

597
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,767
What”s wrong?

598
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,126
Not feeling well?

599
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,921
Take me instead of Chage.

600
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,684
She has the anal pearl now.

601
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,646
She”s that important to you?

602
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:43,882
Yeah.

603
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,371
She's just a violent old woman.

604
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,090
You must be an idiot.

605
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,810
For a God of Death,
you don”t see anything.

606
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,407
See what?

607
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:02,245
She”s still young at heart.
That”s why I love her.

608
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,046
Take her when she's actually old.

609
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,450
Now is too soon.

610
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:12,800
That”s not your call.

611
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,684
Please, I'm begging you.

612
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,322
You really want to lake her place?

613
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,643
Yeah.

614
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:26,809
You might be reborn as cow shit.
Still willing to do this?

615
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:28,687
That”s fine.

616
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,400
Blue sky today.

617
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,808
Yeah. Sure hate to lose
a good friend, too.

618
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:49,922
Sorry.

619
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,290
Aoki.

620
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:47,369
The anal pearl... it's in.

621
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,204
Ll hurts like hell.

622
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,087
It really hurts, Aoki.

623
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,970
You”ll get used to it.

624
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,090
I convinced the God of Death
to let you live.

625
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:01,927
Really?

626
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,051
I'm so glad.

627
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,368
What”s wrong? You okay?

628
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,329
I'm glad I got to see you.

629
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,124
What”re you talking about?

630
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,369
I wrote this for you years ago.

631
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,047
What is il?

632
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:26,886
A love letter, sort of.

633
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,281
You dork.

634
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,962
Well, goodbye, Chage.

635
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,361
Wait, what”s going on?

636
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,809
Hey, Aoki, wake up.

637
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:51,290
You're joking, right?
Aoki, Aoki!

638
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,007
Hey.

639
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:15,887
Aoki.

640
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,406
Aoki, wake up.

641
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,521
Why”d you have to die?

642
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:43,682
I wrote a love letter
to you, too, you know.

643
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,210
This isn't fair! We came this far!

644
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,490
Damn you, God of Death!

645
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,210
I'll kill you!

646
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,127
Aoki.

647
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:28,526
Come back to life.

648
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,087
Aoki.

649
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,201
Please.

650
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,167
Please.

651
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,481
Oh my god.

652
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:13,729
Aoki, wake up, please

653
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:52,881
Aoki.

654
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,447
Been a while.

655
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:01,881
I'm so glad.

656
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:27,487
Aoki.

657
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:29,927
Chage.

658
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:43,127
Aoki.

659
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,287
Chage.

660
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,207
Chage, I love you.

661
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:01,766
Ii Love you, too.

662
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:12,970
I'm going to come.

663
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:14,686
Me, too.

664
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:34,681
Aoki.

665
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:10,528
"Chage, I like you. I like you a lot

666
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:14,643
Can we walk
to school together next time?"

667
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:41,204
"This may seem sudden,
but I've fallen for you, Aoki.

668
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:47,730
When I see your face,
my back gets tingly.

669
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:55,084
I'm so glad we”re in the same class.

670
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:02,889
I hope I'll be able
to see you forever and ever.

671
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:08,968
Maybe I can be your girlfriend?”

672
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,486
Let”s meet again someday, somewhere.

673
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:01,801
I saw your hand in my dream.

674
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:08,086
Your cute, white hand.

675
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:13,848
It was a terrible nightmare.

676
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:20,048
A nightmare in which
I kill lhe one I love.

677
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:26,288
its just a dream.
its just a dream.

678
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,562
But if it's my dream.
It may come true.

679
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:41,891
You turn into a kappa.
And play baseball forever.

680
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:48,241
