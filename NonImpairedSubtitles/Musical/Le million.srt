1
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:22,780
The story is set
in Paris around 1 930

2
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:16,693
I don't mind being kept awake,

3
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,390
but at least tell me
why you're all so merry.

4
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,031
You haven't heard!

5
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,795
They haven't heard!

6
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:29,102
They haven't heard the events
So we'll tell the story to you.

7
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:33,269
You may think it all nonsense
Though every word is true.

8
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,182
Can you give us an explanation?

9
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:43,286
You want an explanation? Very well.

10
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:47,649
We'd be happy to relate
the whole story

11
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,922
Since everything here
is now hunky-dory

12
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,089
But to explain
how it all came to pass

13
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,162
Father Time would have
to change his way.

14
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:01,705
So be patient
and have yourselves a glass

15
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:05,299
And let's go back to early today.

16
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,742
So be patient
and have yourselves a glass

17
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,941
And let's go back to early today.

18
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,758
And let's go back to early today.

19
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,181
Leave us alone, pal.

20
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,118
Shut up, you fool.

21
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:23,817
What is it...
What do you want, Beatrice?

22
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,957
Nothing. Nothing.
I didn't mean to disturb you.

23
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,828
Excuse me.

24
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,628
That girl seemed annoyed.
Is she your girlfriend?

25
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,207
No, she's a neighbor.

26
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,811
She's a dancer. She's quite nice.

27
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:51,482
But she didn't know I was doing
your portrait. It surprised her.

28
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,918
You're probably wooing her.

29
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:57,216
Not at all.
We're just sort of engaged.

30
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,525
Why do you bother with Michel?
You always run after him.

31
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,795
You love him.
Well, that's your business.

32
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,296
You always wait on him.

33
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,876
I promised to mend his old jacket.
I was bringing it back.

34
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,875
It's too old to mend.

35
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,704
Anyway, I've had enough.

36
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,383
Sure, he's a nice fella.

37
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:31,654
He's my friend.
I can't badmouth him. But still...

38
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,488
He's short, not good-looking,
and he has a big nose.

39
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,523
But you're so soft on him.

40
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,187
Me, soft on him?

41
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,109
- Who is it?
- The butcher.

42
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,084
The gentleman's not in.

43
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:04,349
Oh, no? Then just tell him
if he doesn't pay his bill today

44
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,253
he'll have to answer to me.

45
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:09,953
I'm wise to people's tricks
when they're flat broke.

46
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,224
When you can't pay,
you don't go shopping. Thief!

47
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,561
Him, a thief?

48
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:18,996
Don't give me that!
You're the one who owes me.

49
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,996
How can you accept that?

50
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,767
Ignore him. He'll go away.

51
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:26,606
Forget your floozies and find a job.
Bum! Good-for-nothing!

52
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,213
If you don't like it, come on out.

53
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,614
Loafer!
I'll have your furniture impounded.

54
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:38,584
It's better not to answer
people like that back.

55
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:48,597
Why don't you just pay the man?

56
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,200
Because I'm hard up right now.

57
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:54,238
But not for long.
I'm expecting some money.

58
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,971
How annoying.

59
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:03,180
It's the third time we've been
interrupted since I arrived.

60
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,408
No way to see the fellow.

61
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,384
They're awful people,
these artists, these doodlers!

62
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:09,783
He owes me 2 months.

63
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,116
And 2 months' rent!

64
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,986
Let me get my hands on him.

65
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,719
I was just upstairs.
He wouldn't open the door.

66
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:16,829
Same here.

67
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,455
Don't worry. We'll have
his furniture impounded tomorrow.

68
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll be here with this gentleman.

69
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,898
We'll impound.

70
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,472
Enough is enough.
This has gone on too long.

71
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,142
Going, Wanda dear?

72
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,274
Look at how you're dressed!

73
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,582
Relax, I'm the boss now.

74
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,923
Here, pal...

75
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,924
Why the get-up?

76
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,622
Because it's your turn.

77
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,926
Why should I play the servant alone?

78
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,506
Get off my back. Wait a minute.

79
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:08,446
Close your door
when you entertain your mistresses.

80
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,411
But Beatrice...

81
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,777
You let her insult me!

82
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:14,013
No, Wanda, don't go.

83
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,654
You're being ridiculous, Beatrice!

84
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,518
Wanda, listen!

85
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,625
I'm sorry, dear.
I'll finish your portrait tomorrow.

86
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,598
You'd do better
to pay the milk maid.

87
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,133
Quiet, you old bat!

88
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,497
Scoundrel!

89
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,732
Murderer! Artist!

90
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,427
So there you are!

91
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,265
And now, young man,
you can pay my bill.

92
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,599
And mine.

93
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,968
You owe me, too.

94
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,575
And my bill.

95
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,338
Enough, gentlemen!
I don't settle bills in stairwells.

96
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,606
There's a lady present.

97
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,239
Your business doesn't concern me.

98
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,478
I'll leave you to your friends.
Goodbye.

99
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,552
Goodbye, my dear.

100
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,317
Good day, gentlemen.
That's enough!

101
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,949
I won't stand
for your penny-pinching manners.

102
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:06,556
The nerve!
Penny-pinching manners, us?

103
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,035
- Stop, thief!
- He's on the run.

104
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:20,237
- Stop, thief!
- Catch that one.

105
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:23,246
He went that way,
he'll come this way

106
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,406
Stop, thief!

107
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,279
Stop that man, I say!

108
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,902
What are you doing here?

109
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,335
Please, young lady, not a word.

110
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,940
You come into my room,
take that jacket...

111
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,841
Young lady, let me ask you
one question. Just one.

112
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,273
Do you enjoy the piano?

113
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:12,816
- What?
- I can tell you do. Come here.

114
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:55,820
Who's after you?
Are you in debt, too?

115
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,094
Why are they after you?

116
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:06,334
Listen, child, you've just done me
a great, great service.

117
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:11,568
If ever you need a helping hand,
count on me.

118
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,112
Grandpa Tulip.

119
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,704
23, rue des Vieilles Haudriettes.

120
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,581
Are you done playing?

121
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:25,883
Why?

122
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,792
I have to run out the door.

123
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,863
Then I won't keep you.

124
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:36,992
Would you mind
if I kept the jacket?

125
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,802
But it's not mine.

126
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,565
It's worthless.

127
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,308
Let go!

128
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,285
Will you let go of me!

129
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,286
- I'll put the cuffs on you.
- Leave him to us.

130
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,719
Let go!

131
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,787
You're hurting me!

132
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,198
- He's not our man.
- He's not?

133
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,257
What d'you want?

134
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,391
Will you pay us?

135
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,164
Will you pay us?

136
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:15,664
Will you pay?

137
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,537
We'll count to three.

138
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,669
We'll count to three.

139
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,371
One...

140
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,506
Two...

141
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:26,780
Three...

142
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,246
Yes!

143
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,017
What's got into you?

144
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,751
Read this.
One of us is a millionaire.

145
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:38,087
- Millionaire?
- That's right, fella...

146
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,627
- What's the matter?
- Look.

147
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,998
NO. 27 009 WlNS
1 MlLLlON FLORlNS

148
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,866
The Dutch Lottery!

149
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,873
We bought tickets.
Who won, you or me?

150
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,067
The tickets!

151
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,677
What's this nonsense?

152
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,642
Is it you? Or me?

153
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,648
Listen, please!

154
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:58,943
The tickets!

155
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,381
You noted the numbers.

156
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,077
My notebook.

157
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,357
Is it you? Is it me?
Answer me, dummy!

158
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,619
I don't know. Take a look.

159
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:13,761
Let's make a deal. Whether
it's you or me, we split it, okay?

160
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:16,925
No way, old man.
If it's me, I keep it all.

161
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,400
See how he is?

162
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,835
This joke's gone far enough.

163
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:22,997
You'll see.

164
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,107
- Split or no split?
- Not a cent.

165
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,370
Okay.

166
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,458
Well?

167
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,359
Dammit!

168
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:53,028
It's me. Say, what's a million
florins come out to?

169
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:58,169
It comes out to... Iots of millions.
I don't know how much.

170
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,445
Imagine that! Imagine that!

171
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,544
This is terrific! Aren't you glad?

172
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,778
You'll all be paid tomorrow.

173
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,780
How do we know
you have this ticket?

174
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,626
A good point.
Come with me. You'll see.

175
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:18,693
Gladly.

176
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:44,754
Upwards, upwards,
to the light up there.

177
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:49,259
We'll see if his claim is true

178
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,894
If the painter is really
a millionaire.

179
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:54,999
The baker...

180
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,158
The butcher...

181
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,268
The grocer...

182
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,369
The dairy maid...

183
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:02,497
We shall bear witness to his virtue.

184
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,751
Do you remember
where I put the ticket?

185
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,788
No, I don't, old man.

186
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,196
What a dope! Beatrice has it.

187
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,678
Darn! She's out!

188
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:52,214
Stay here, old man.
Watch the door till she gets back.

189
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,148
My fortune's in this room.

190
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,917
I can't show you the ticket now.

191
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:03,126
It's in there, all right,
but it's locked. I have to wait.

192
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:07,763
Look, we'll come back later.

193
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,134
No. I insist on showing it to you.

194
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,267
You'll see it soon enough.

195
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:17,140
Some port, gentlemen!

196
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,381
Don't worrry.

197
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:26,950
I'll go fetch a bottle.

198
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,110
Bring a dozen, while you're at it.

199
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:30,448
A dozen? All right.

200
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,988
And some pastries.

201
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,185
And champagne.

202
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,651
And then...

203
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:40,322
I'll leave it up to you.
So long as it's quality stuff.

204
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,263
Have no fear. I'll be right back.

205
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,363
Gentlemen, please, take a seat.

206
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,911
Millionaire! Millionaire!

207
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,176
Who?
That beggar, that bohemian?

208
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,809
The fellow in the studio.

209
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:05,915
The one who's behind in his rent.
He's become a...

210
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,351
Millionaire!

211
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,395
The one who never pays?

212
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,265
What a lucky fellow!

213
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,661
He'll be paying me now.

214
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,198
Sure, it's easy when you're a...

215
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,497
Millionaire!

216
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,840
The million's been won!

217
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,046
Get your lottery results!

218
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,182
Who? Michel? He won what?

219
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,048
Enough money to burn.

220
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,587
Gentlemen, to his health!

221
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:07,375
Miss, you're needed at home.
It's urgent. Come with me.

222
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:08,444
What for?

223
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,241
Dunno. They just sent me.

224
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:11,906
What happened?

225
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:14,045
You can run along.

226
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,915
I'm parked just outside.

227
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,869
Is Michel here?

228
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,533
Police.

229
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,938
- Where?
- That fellow.

230
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,943
- You sure?
- I think so.

231
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:41,995
What do you want?

232
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,672
Why... nothing.

233
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,471
What are you doing here?

234
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,307
I came to...

235
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,108
Who are you?

236
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,407
Who am l?

237
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,650
I am Ambrosio Sopranelli.

238
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,756
Tenor at the New York Met.

239
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,284
Tenor?

240
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:04,721
Prove it.

241
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:06,827
Sing!

242
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,632
Don't shoot. I'll sing.

243
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:14,600
Do you sense the courage

244
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:18,732
That now sustains my arm?

245
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:23,677
Do you see my visage
Which betrays no alarm?

246
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,850
O angel mine,

247
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:31,114
All danger I shall decline.

248
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:35,591
O angel mine!

249
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,572
Goodbye, Michel.
Goodbye, my love.

250
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,534
Michel, here comes Beatrice.

251
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,266
Quick! Open up!

252
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,705
- What is it?
- I'm a millionaire.

253
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,868
- He's gone crazy.
- He's right.

254
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,981
Open up, quick!
My million's inside, you know.

255
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:36,382
The jacket, Beatrice. The jacket.

256
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:37,910
Yes, the jacket.

257
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,250
What for?

258
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,382
My lottery ticket's in it.

259
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:43,721
Oh, my God! I don't have it.

260
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,221
You don't have it?

261
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:48,892
Where did it go?

262
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,201
Here you are, and thank you.

263
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,731
And if you want to hear me...

264
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,573
I'm at the Opera Lyrique.

265
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,579
You forgot your cane, sir.

266
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,250
Why return his cane?

267
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:10,854
To pinch his watch.

268
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,992
They were chasing him, you see...

269
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:21,030
I gave him the jacket...
so they wouldn't recognize him.

270
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:25,899
I don't know...
it was an old, beat-up jacket...

271
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,732
I didn't think...

272
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,175
You didn't think, you didn't think.
Don't think.

273
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:34,403
No mistake about it.
It's gone for good.

274
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,381
Go on, fella.
Don't panic.

275
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:48,083
You can't tell them what happened.

276
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:51,024
Go out there.
Put on a happy face, and laugh.

277
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:52,789
Fake it. Go on.

278
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,574
In the name of all the tenants here,

279
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,184
so proud to know a millionaire,

280
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,787
accept this bouquet of flowers

281
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,355
and may your happiness be ours.

282
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:36,136
Didn't the man who took the jacket
leave a name or address?

283
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:40,040
Yes, but I forgot it.
There was so much confusion...

284
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:45,012
But I think... it was like
the name of a flower.

285
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,118
Something like Grandpa Rose.

286
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,389
Grandpa Tulip.

287
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,519
I'm sure of it.

288
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,126
And his address?

289
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:59,094
The address, I don't know.

290
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,092
A smile, sir. More.

291
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:08,763
Tilt your head a bit...
The bouquet...

292
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,033
That's it.

293
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:13,633
Imagine, this picture will be
in all the papers tomorrow.

294
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:17,908
Smile. More, more.
Just a little bit...

295
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,610
Smile a bit more. To the right.

296
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:25,954
Hold it right there. Smile.

297
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:27,582
That's it.

298
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:30,717
It didn't come out. Sorry, sir.

299
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,226
But isn't there a way
to find his address?

300
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:43,164
Tough luck.
Grandpa Tulip should be enough.

301
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:45,742
It should be easy
to find a Tulip in Paris.

302
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:49,506
Look, I'm going to give
Michel a hand.

303
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:50,906
Wait a minute...

304
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:54,374
Smile. Smile.

305
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,745
That's it.

306
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:01,386
Does she have any clues?

307
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,255
No, nothing.

308
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,787
No, no. This can't be!

309
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:11,197
Look here, I want to do
something for you.

310
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:16,440
I have some contacts. If I find
the ticket, do we split it?

311
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,106
Split it? No, we don't split it.

312
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,644
Then go look for your ticket.

313
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,877
If you call that friendship...

314
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,482
Why did you ask?

315
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:28,776
It was just a hunch I had.

316
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,548
Oh, why not!
I have nothing to lose now.

317
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:37,661
It's a deal?
However I manage,

318
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:40,958
if I bring you the ticket,
we split the million.

319
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:41,997
It's a deal.

320
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:43,532
Word of honor?

321
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:45,993
Then you're on, pal.

322
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:47,796
Don't hold your breath.

323
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,041
Tulip...

324
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,657
I'm so sorry.

325
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,393
And we needed the money
to get married.

326
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,293
That's out of the question now.

327
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,831
Why?

328
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:19,230
Forgot already? I'll never forget.

329
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,702
But you'll find your million.

330
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:26,873
Oh, so what.

331
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:30,208
I remembered the thief's name.
I told Prosper.

332
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:32,145
He went off to find him.

333
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,741
Prosper? The bastard!
So that's it.

334
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,281
What's the name?

335
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,721
Grandpa Tulip.

336
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,828
Oh, why bother!

337
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:49,130
I'm not going to start chasing
after this Tulip fellow.

338
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,693
23, rue des Vieilles Haudriettes.

339
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:54,131
That's Grandpa Tulip's address.

340
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,295
Good heavens!

341
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,380
We are the foot soldiers
of inequality

342
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:16,892
We take back the spoils
of social injustice

343
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:20,191
And under the watchful eye
of the police...

344
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,059
...watchful eye of the police

345
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:28,730
We redistribute wealth
and private property.

346
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:30,438
At ease.

347
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:34,375
Gentlemen,
I almost got arrested today.

348
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,913
The police are on our trail.
We must be careful.

349
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:40,241
Anyone on guard outside?

350
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:42,112
Yes. Young Laborde.

351
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,050
Good. Let's get to work.

352
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,924
Are you Grandpa Tulip?

353
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,431
What can I do for you?

354
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:33,230
I'm Michel Bouflette.
The owner of the jacket.

355
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:34,895
What jacket?

356
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:39,140
The jacket a young lady
lent you this morning,

357
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,575
when you were in bad straits.

358
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:47,207
I'm here for the jacket
you borrowed from me.

359
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,179
But it was worthless.

360
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,813
This man was wearing
a superb jacket.

361
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:55,118
I followed him in the street,

362
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,422
I went into his shop
and bought the jacket.

363
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:02,764
A great artist must pay attention
to the slightest details.

364
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:08,005
I'm all set to sing "The Bohemians"
in this costume.

365
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:11,838
Alone are we,

366
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:14,843
O beloved!

367
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,939
My watch! My watch chain!

368
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:24,085
But why sell the jacket to a singer
who's going to America?

369
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:27,623
How should I know?
He said it was for a role.

370
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,658
A role?

371
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,591
Do you know his name?

372
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,736
We bought his watch.

373
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,867
So what if you did?

374
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,776
It may have his name inside.

375
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,108
Exactly.

376
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:52,977
The watch, son.

377
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,380
Good idea.

378
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,312
You're Crochard, alias The Tulip.

379
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:26,810
Me?

380
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,282
Who's watch is that?

381
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,649
Just what I'd like to know.

382
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:33,655
Don't get funny with me, buster!

383
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,224
Take him away.

384
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:40,024
We are the foot soldiers of legality

385
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:43,930
No bandit can escape the police

386
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:46,434
Our arm upholds
the scales ofjustice

387
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:51,036
In the name of public virtue
and private property.

388
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:17,624
Gentlemen, this jacket business
looks very suspect to me.

389
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,663
I sell it to a singer,

390
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:22,671
and another man comes
to get it back,

391
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:26,072
upon which we get a police raid.

392
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:30,044
So tonight we go
to the Opera Lyrique

393
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,513
and we get that jacket.

394
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:55,162
Michel, Michel,
how can you sit there?

395
00:37:56,073 --> 00:38:00,066
When will you be a millionaire?

396
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:03,612
You won't stop the clock by whining

397
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,380
The meter's running,
the price is climbing!

398
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:14,114
Victory was there for you to hold

399
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:18,626
Somewhere yourjacket's flying

400
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:22,298
With a pocketful of gold

401
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,539
Mr. Prosper Benevant?

402
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,020
Report to the station.

403
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,189
Why?

404
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,783
They arrested a man
who claims to know you.

405
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:54,557
He lost his papers.
We need you to identify him.

406
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,759
I'll be right down.

407
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,581
Ambrosio Sopranelli.

408
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:20,953
Ambrosio... Sopa...

409
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,890
Sopranelli. The singer.

410
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,962
I'm singing tonight
at the Opera Lyrique.

411
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,589
I'm off to America
to sing my repertoire.

412
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,064
Repert...

413
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:35,003
Carmen, Paillasse, Rigoletto.

414
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,033
That watch meant a lot to me.

415
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:44,240
I'm sure Grandpa Tulip stole it.

416
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:48,978
The police does its job.

417
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:52,952
Here's your watch.

418
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,047
And here's Grandpa Tulip.

419
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:57,023
- Is this yours?
- lndeed it is.

420
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,685
So you bought my jacket.

421
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,660
The one Grandpa Tulip wore.

422
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,231
But it's mine.

423
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:05,164
So you admit
to being Grandpa Tulip.

424
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:07,634
No, no. But this man...

425
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,707
Are you or aren't you
Grandpa Tulip?

426
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,405
Then be quiet.

427
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,168
Be quiet.

428
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,142
No, I'm trying to explain...

429
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,010
It's important to me.

430
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,381
Excuse me,
but the watch is mine.

431
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,953
The jacket is mine.
Everything is mine.

432
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,487
The jacket's mine.

433
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:31,254
Take them away.

434
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:33,659
My jacket! Let go!

435
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:35,962
My jacket!

436
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,666
Don't let it get away!

437
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,203
May I go?

438
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:42,498
Sit down.

439
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:48,976
Prosper, quick!

440
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:55,979
The guy there. Sopranelli. He sings
at the Opera Lyrique tonight.

441
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,419
He's got the jacket. Go get it.
At the Opera Lyrique.

442
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,099
What is it?

443
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:17,367
Sir, here's the person
for the interrogation.

444
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:22,002
Fine. Go fetch this Tulip fellow.

445
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,544
Just a moment, sir.

446
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,050
It's all right.

447
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:38,595
So, sir...
Will you release my fare?

448
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,023
Wait outside.

449
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:45,101
Wait, wait...
And the meter's running...

450
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,635
I can't help you.

451
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,798
Can I go now?

452
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:52,408
Sit down, you!

453
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,780
Do you know this gentleman?

454
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:03,614
Me?

455
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:05,216
Not at all.

456
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,818
Is this a joke?

457
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:10,659
I never saw him before.

458
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,254
Never saw me before?

459
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:16,798
Sure, I saw him a moment ago
when he was making a fuss...

460
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,799
It's the first time I saw him.

461
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,596
He's known me for over 20 years.

462
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,673
That's a lie. I don't know him.

463
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:25,803
You don't know me?

464
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:28,968
You don't know me?

465
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:30,841
No, I don't know him.

466
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,209
No one asked you.

467
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,943
- Can I go now?
- Sit down.

468
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:43,754
Hey, you, do you realize
what you're doing?

469
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:48,130
You bet, I do.

470
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,199
Why are you doing this?

471
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:51,960
Can't you guess?

472
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:53,501
No, I can't.

473
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,704
This morning you said
we'd share the million

474
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,570
if I found the ticket.

475
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:03,775
This way I'm sure to get it.
As promised.

476
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,244
I'm going to break your neck.

477
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:10,245
I'm going to break your neck,
you hear!

478
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:12,617
Don't forget your hat.

479
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:15,784
You louse! You gangster!

480
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:19,758
You bastard! You'll pay for this.

481
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:22,565
Can I go, sir?

482
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,565
You're free to go.

483
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,940
Prosper, what have you done?

484
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:40,607
Prosper, what have you done?

485
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:43,618
As a friend, you're no paragon

486
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:46,814
Let your conscience confess

487
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:50,085
That your friend is in distress

488
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:52,957
Prosper, what have you done?

489
00:43:56,533 --> 00:44:01,266
Best not to give another thought
To the remorse your acts brought

490
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:04,101
Don 't let it get the better of you

491
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:07,836
Instead of trying to make amends

492
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:12,472
Go spend a moment or two
With a charming lady friend

493
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:23,059
I don't understand this.

494
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,022
So you'll get the million?

495
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:27,862
The thing is...

496
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,158
Not quite.

497
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:34,127
It's like this: Michel and l
each have a claim on the ticket.

498
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:38,674
But Michel's in trouble,
so he'll get whatever I give him.

499
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:42,210
It all depends on
how generous I want to be.

500
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,310
Then you're a rich man.

501
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:48,316
Yes... not yet...
but very soon I will be.

502
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:50,613
I'm so happy...

503
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,155
for you.

504
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,400
Prosper, how can you dare?

505
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,605
Let the voice of virtue declare

506
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,471
See your friend, see his state

507
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:18,604
The jacket's gone, the hour's late,
The proud fighter has not a prayer

508
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:21,845
Prosper, how can you dare?

509
00:45:58,122 --> 00:45:59,316
It's him!

510
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:02,220
This is Michel Bouflette?

511
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:04,889
You'll vouch for him?

512
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:09,430
So swear we, he's the millionaire.

513
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:13,127
This is Michel. Yes, it is.
So swear we.

514
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:17,204
So swear we, Mister Commissioner.

515
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:21,569
No law can make us forswear.

516
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:25,537
We, his friends, shall set him free.

517
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:28,446
So swear we, so swear we.

518
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:33,747
So swear we, Mister Commissioner.

519
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:36,317
This is Michel. Yes, it is.

520
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,056
So swear we.

521
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:42,793
It's about time.
You have to pay up.

522
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:44,560
That's enough!

523
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:47,261
Wait at my place

524
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:49,372
while I run over
to the Opera Lyrique.

525
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:52,202
Not me. I want my money.

526
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:55,334
If you want your money,
you have to drive me.

527
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:58,815
I'm not used to working this way.

528
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:02,309
I can't buy gas with promises.

529
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:50,122
- It's for the bouquet.
- Just a second.

530
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:58,663
Get out, sir! I've had enough
of this jacket business.

531
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,640
Just when I'm about to sing.

532
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:03,405
- But I only wanted to ask...
- Get out of here!

533
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:08,974
When would you like these ladies
to throw you the bouquet?

534
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:11,948
At the end of Act One,
after the love duet.

535
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:14,148
Make sure it's in my direction.

536
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:15,818
Did you understand?

537
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:17,153
You can count on us.

538
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:11,746
So, you're one
of my greatest admirers?

539
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:13,372
Oh, yes.

540
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:16,516
You're so handsome in that costume.

541
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:19,816
Wait until you see me with my beard.

542
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:22,284
Look.

543
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:33,698
Tell me, child,

544
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:37,462
why don't we speak
after the performance?

545
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:41,338
Come to my dressing room
after the final curtain.

546
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,003
Oh, certainly, Maestro.

547
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,605
Nothing could make me happier.
See you later.

548
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:25,946
What is it, child?

549
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:29,024
Nothing.
I just wanted to see you.

550
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,087
How sweet.

551
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:34,052
You're in the ballet?

552
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:37,598
Yes, I'm dancing.
I've heard you sing so often.

553
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:42,296
Then you'll be delighted
to hear me on stage.

554
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:45,207
You're so charming.

555
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:49,444
Would you mind if I watch you
put on your makeup?

556
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:54,441
Well... of course, take a seat.

557
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,645
She's irresistible.

558
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:14,561
You have such a nice voice.

559
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:18,272
You haven't heard anything yet.
Just wait...

560
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,536
Oh, yes, I know.
But it's still so pleasant.

561
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:23,407
She's so charming.

562
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,753
- What is it?
- Nothing.

563
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:36,925
Would you pass me
the jacket there, child?

564
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:42,126
Here. Here.

565
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:44,958
Thank you.

566
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:47,030
Isn't she adorable!

567
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:50,105
Will you come see me
after the performance?

568
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:52,935
Who is it?

569
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,147
- On stage.
- Coming.

570
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,373
They're waiting.

571
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:01,507
Coming. So you'll come?

572
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,145
Coming?

573
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,051
Excuse me, I'll be right there.

574
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,418
Until later.

575
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:26,275
- Did you get the ticket?
- I couldn't.

576
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:27,433
Why not?

577
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:30,375
Someone was with him.
I saw the jacket.

578
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:46,229
Hello, Michel.

579
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:47,796
Working for Prosper now?

580
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:49,728
- Not at all.
- Nice work.

581
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,800
- But I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

582
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:53,266
Let me explain.

583
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:56,395
There's nothing to explain.
I get the picture.

584
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,021
Who are you? Thief!

585
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,150
Let me out of here!

586
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,431
Stop him!

587
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,796
Don't let him get away!

588
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:28,956
I might be her brother!

589
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,964
I might be her father!

590
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:44,847
- What are we waiting for?
- Madame Ravellina.

591
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:46,505
I won't be kept waiting.

592
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,117
That's not the costume!

593
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:50,014
That's the "Bohemian" costume.

594
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,182
But we start with the love duet.

595
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:53,289
That's right.

596
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:54,947
No one told me.

597
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,458
On stage, madame.

598
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:04,291
We're locked in!

599
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:08,995
Let us out!

600
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:13,509
Let me go!

601
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:30,216
On stage!

602
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:32,588
Quick! Quick!

603
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,333
Now it's my turn!

604
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:44,171
I refuse to change.

605
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:46,308
What are you doing backstage?

606
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,669
But you can't!

607
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:50,712
The public's waited long enough.
Because of her.

608
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:51,836
What?

609
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:54,973
Sopranelli waits for no one.

610
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:57,484
I won't stand for criticism.

611
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,588
- But your costume!
- I don't care!

612
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:01,884
- What will the audience think?

613
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:04,016
Leave them to me.

614
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,388
He's mad.
The management will hear of this.

615
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:36,945
Alone are we at last tonight

616
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:42,289
All else to their slumbers
have gone

617
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:48,093
Alone are we
in the failing light

618
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:53,168
Side by side
upon this bench of stone

619
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:58,871
We are free at last to speak openly

620
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:04,569
Far from the crowds,
the city's blare

621
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:10,213
Far from the world and its agony

622
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:15,422
Truth is what we find here

623
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:21,920
What sorrow clouds thy sense?

624
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:24,659
O heart, what is my offense?

625
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:28,259
O pity, see how I grieve

626
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:32,932
Yes, great is my adversity

627
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:35,772
There is no balm, no reprieve

628
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:39,211
Thou lovest me not,
I who love thee

629
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:43,474
Heed not thy jealous heart

630
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:49,153
Nothing shall keep us apart

631
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:55,956
We are alone in the forest

632
00:58:56,466 --> 00:59:01,563
This blessed place is our shrine

633
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:06,838
Let your hand in my hand rest

634
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:12,309
And our fingers forever entwine

635
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:18,147
I lack the force to resist thy pleas

636
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:24,091
I feel so weak when thou art near

637
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:30,063
Let me gaze into thine eyes

638
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:35,129
Let thy love be all most dear

639
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:44,975
Let us forget sorrows past

640
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:47,844
Let us sad thoughts outcast

641
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:50,919
Let the Spring now sow its pedals

642
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:56,054
In the furrows of thy hair

643
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:59,157
Our pain shan 't our love unsettle

644
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:02,596
The breeze on this night so fair

645
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:07,226
Carries off our coupled sighs

646
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:12,906
Far away toward distant skies

647
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:20,080
In the forest deep are we alone

648
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:25,319
What care we of fortune's sting?

649
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:31,322
When Heaven to us opens its throne

650
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:36,861
Pure gold do the moonbeams bring

651
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:43,132
When the Earth is graced
from up Above

652
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:48,971
The night is sworn to secrecy

653
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:54,779
Cradled in eternal love

654
01:00:56,052 --> 01:01:01,319
Alone in the forest are we

655
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:00,504
Why do you keep stroking
your beard like that?

656
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:02,975
I believe we've met before, child.

657
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,138
Think hard.

658
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:10,515
Grandpa Tulip.

659
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:15,923
Don't count on me
for any more jackets.

660
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:19,251
The troubles I've had over that!

661
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:22,397
Look, sir,
you promised to help me.

662
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:27,401
All I ask is: give me my jacket
back now. I must have it.

663
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:31,764
You'll have your jacket, child.
There's not a minute to lose.

664
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:33,068
- Honest?
- Yes, go on.

665
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:34,369
- You promise?
- I promise.

666
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:35,807
I'll get it?

667
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:37,640
Thank you, sir.

668
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:55,998
Gentlemen...

669
01:03:58,267 --> 01:04:02,897
THE BOHEMlANS
Opera in three acts

670
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:41,410
Give us the giddiness
Give us the caress

671
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:45,207
Of a ravishing mistress!

672
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:56,590
That's our only happiness!

673
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:13,206
We are alone, O angel mine!

674
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:20,015
Join me beneath the scented pine.

675
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:34,562
What sight do my eyes take in?

676
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:39,801
What! Laurence in this place of sin?

677
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:43,633
Impure girl, get thee hence

678
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:48,372
Or my wrath shall chastise thee!

679
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:52,737
I laugh at your violence!

680
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:58,047
She laughs at his violence!

681
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:54,199
They fight! Make haste!
They are crimson-faced!

682
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:57,278
Anger takes its toll.
We must keep them apart.

683
01:06:57,413 --> 01:07:01,042
Assassin of my heart!

684
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:05,277
Ravisher of my soul!

685
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:45,392
Mother, thy face I descry.

686
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:54,163
Son, I hear thee cry.

687
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,998
I die.

688
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:02,777
You die.

689
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:07,042
He dies.

690
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:14,279
O tragic demise!

691
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:56,161
Heavens, he is dead.
What is this I hearest?

692
01:08:57,533 --> 01:09:01,435
Laurence, hear me now.

693
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:09,405
Hear me now, my dearest.

694
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:14,911
Now even the stars do bemoan

695
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:21,318
This life by my hand bereft.

696
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:27,156
Of my last friends, none are left...

697
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:38,297
But what care I for remorse

698
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:41,807
When I love thee.

699
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:44,879
Thou lovest me!

700
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:57,354
Till death do us part!

701
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:27,859
You again! What do you take me for?
I told you to move on.

702
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:32,064
I've been around the block
a dozen times.

703
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:36,371
I'm waiting for my fare to come out.
He's got to pay me.

704
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:38,670
Here he comes now.

705
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:42,309
Next time I'll hit you
with a ticket.

706
01:13:59,868 --> 01:14:02,894
Where to now? The police station?

707
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:06,474
Not the station. You can spend
your life there. Home!

708
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,439
Home? Where's home?

709
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:11,102
You were waiting there this morning.

710
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:12,838
Will I get paid this time?

711
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:14,676
Sure, sure, you'll get paid.

712
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:16,682
- It's about time.
- You tire me out.

713
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:19,652
I tire you?
I just want what's coming to me.

714
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:35,531
Michel, Michel,
how can you sit there?

715
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:46,740
The meter's running,
the price is climbing.

716
01:14:57,159 --> 01:15:00,925
With a pocketful of gold.

717
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:20,648
The jacket!

718
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:22,147
It was on the roof.

719
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:24,445
That's great!

720
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:26,679
Not a word! Not a move!

721
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:28,119
Shut up!

722
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:32,652
- This can't be!
- Don't, Michel, stay here!

723
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:39,762
After them, you idiot!
They're getting away.

724
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:43,804
After them? That's a good one.
And stop a bullet?

725
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:47,875
No. Pay the fare and that's that.
Goodbye and good riddance.

726
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:52,344
Or else I'll take you to the cops.
There are too many guys like you.

727
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:54,642
Risk my life for an honest living?

728
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:59,914
I've got a wife and I might have
kids some day. I'm a future father.

729
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:14,201
If you don't want to pay, say so.

730
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:16,668
I'll take you to the cops.

731
01:16:16,805 --> 01:16:18,204
I heard you. Thanks.

732
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,774
No, you didn't hear.
I cooled my heels...

733
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:23,707
- I haven't a cent on me.
- Then don't take taxis.

734
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:24,903
Look for yourself.

735
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:27,811
"Look for yourself."
Where?

736
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:31,918
Come in, ladies and gentlemen.

737
01:16:40,228 --> 01:16:44,562
Give us the giddiness
Give us the caress

738
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:48,693
Of a ravishing mistress!

739
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:02,509
You ought to be glad.
We did things right.

740
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:04,448
That's for sure.

741
01:17:04,586 --> 01:17:07,783
Tell me, are all these folks
creditors?

742
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:10,517
Not all of them. They're neighbors.

743
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:12,684
They brought friends to see you.

744
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:15,194
How nice of them!

745
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:20,231
Driver, have a glass of champagne
and some cake.

746
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:22,030
Sure.

747
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:27,238
Say, mister...
Who's this fellow I've been driving?

748
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:28,543
He's flat broke.

749
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:30,277
Who's paying for this?

750
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:33,040
What a question! You are.

751
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:34,239
- Me!
- It's natural.

752
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:36,078
So it's me.

753
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:40,317
- Aren't you glad?
- Sure I am.

754
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:42,116
That's more like it.

755
01:17:42,457 --> 01:17:43,981
A million?

756
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:47,191
Then why wouldn't he pay his fare?

757
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,957
He didn't have
his lottery ticket then.

758
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:51,463
But he has it now.

759
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,534
We should ask to see it.

760
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:55,398
Sure. You'll see.

761
01:17:58,473 --> 01:18:00,100
Do you have the ticket?

762
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:03,676
That's just what I was saying...

763
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:06,444
- Well then...
- Come on.

764
01:18:07,115 --> 01:18:09,640
- Don't keep us waiting.
- Let's see it.

765
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:10,975
What?

766
01:18:11,753 --> 01:18:12,811
The lottery ticket.

767
01:18:12,954 --> 01:18:13,921
The million.

768
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:15,921
Oh, you want to see the...

769
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,326
Well, then, I'll show you the...

770
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,119
Your attention...

771
01:18:27,169 --> 01:18:29,603
Gentlemen, I have some news.

772
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:31,770
Some bad news.

773
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:35,706
We aren't always masters
of our fate.

774
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:37,909
Is Miss Beatrice here?

775
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:41,243
No, that's enough, please,
leave me alone.

776
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:45,816
I kept the ticket in a jacket,
and this jacket...

777
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:49,717
The jacket!

778
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:58,762
But the jacket's empty!

779
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:02,295
This is the end. The jacket's empty.

780
01:19:02,437 --> 01:19:04,598
Explain the problem to me.

781
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,139
The ticket was in it.

782
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:07,366
What ticket?

783
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:08,806
The lottery ticket.

784
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:11,344
I was asked
to bring back a jacket...

785
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,278
- It's the ticket I want.
- So I brought a jacket.

786
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:15,508
The lining!

787
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:20,211
There was a ticket in the pocket.

788
01:19:20,355 --> 01:19:21,481
What ticket?

789
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:23,488
The lottery ticket!

790
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:27,788
Then say so. Had you told me
about a lottery ticket,

791
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:31,228
I'd have brought you
a lottery ticket.

792
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:35,325
It would have been easy,
because it's right here.

793
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:39,963
The ticket that was in the jacket.
I have it. Here it is!

794
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:48,741
When you haven't got a cent

795
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:53,410
You're never content,
And life seems unfair.

796
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:56,814
But your thoughts are gay

797
01:19:56,958 --> 01:20:00,758
When you're young and can say
You're a millionaire.

798
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:04,457
Money isn 't everything, so beware!

799
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:08,501
Well that's what folks pretend.

800
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:12,135
But when you're a millionaire

801
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:15,903
You're not any worse off
in the end.

802
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:19,707
Money isn 't everything, so beware!

803
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:23,181
So say folks who are intelligent

804
01:20:23,785 --> 01:20:25,343
to folks without a cent

805
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:27,478
We'll believe what they say

806
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:30,921
When they give
all their money away

807
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:33,016
And there you have it!
