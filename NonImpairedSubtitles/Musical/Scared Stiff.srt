1
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:49,913
Hey!

2
00:01:51,224 --> 00:01:53,215
Oh, hey! Hello, honey.

3
00:01:56,562 --> 00:01:58,723
- Am I going to see you later?
- You certainly are.

4
00:01:59,632 --> 00:02:02,294
Wait. You can't go out there like that.

5
00:02:06,906 --> 00:02:09,397
- Pierre?
- Yes?

6
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:11,233
The Big Boy wants to see you.

7
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:12,709
- But...
- Now.

8
00:02:13,179 --> 00:02:16,239
- I'll get my hat and coat.
- You won't need them.

9
00:02:42,174 --> 00:02:44,233
Come on, get in here quick.

10
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:50,081
- Boy, it's sure raining cats and dogs.
- Oh, it sure is, Pop.

11
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,180
There you are, Pop.
Find a home for them.

12
00:02:54,287 --> 00:02:56,517
- Brother and sister.
- Brother and sister?

13
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:57,778
Yeah.

14
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:12,195
- Hello, honey.
- Hi, Rosie.

15
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:15,365
Crazy.

16
00:03:17,843 --> 00:03:20,539
Oh, Larry, I'm just an average girl.

17
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:25,013
Honey, if you're an average girl,
I've been going out with boys.

18
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:26,414
Oh, Larry.

19
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:36,387
- Am I going to see you later?
- You certainly are.

20
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:41,224
I know a wonderful place
for just the two of us.

21
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:42,733
Yeah, where?

22
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:45,665
In a telephone booth.

23
00:03:51,777 --> 00:03:54,746
Remind me to bring along
plenty of dimes, huh?

24
00:03:56,082 --> 00:03:57,811
You're on, Mr. Todd.

25
00:04:00,586 --> 00:04:03,214
So here he is, ladies and gentlemen,
that clown prince of song,

26
00:04:03,322 --> 00:04:05,415
the one and only Larry Todd.

27
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:15,423
<i>I don't care if the sun don't shine</i>

28
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:17,866
<i>I get my loving in the evening time</i>

29
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,164
<i>When I'm</i>

30
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:22,107
<i>with my baby</i>

31
00:04:23,309 --> 00:04:25,777
<i>Well, it's no fun with the sun around</i>

32
00:04:25,878 --> 00:04:28,210
<i>But I get going when the sun goes down</i>

33
00:04:28,314 --> 00:04:29,372
<i>And I</i>

34
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:32,416
<i>meet my baby</i>

35
00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:35,946
<i>That's when we kiss and kiss and kiss</i>

36
00:04:36,055 --> 00:04:38,387
<i>And then we kiss some more</i>

37
00:04:38,724 --> 00:04:41,284
<i>Who cares how many times we kiss?</i>

38
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:44,420
<i>Well, at a time like this</i>
<i>who keeps score?</i>

39
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,158
<i>Well, I don't care if the sun don't shine</i>

40
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:49,564
<i>I get my loving in the evening time</i>

41
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:53,571
<i>When I'm with my baby</i>

42
00:04:55,408 --> 00:04:57,706
<i>I don't care if the sun don't shine</i>

43
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,176
<i>I get my loving in the evening time</i>

44
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,303
<i>When I'm</i>

45
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:05,646
<i>- I'm living it up</i>
<i>...with my baby</i>

46
00:05:05,785 --> 00:05:08,413
<i>Well, it's no fun with the sun around</i>

47
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:10,682
<i>But I get going when the sun goes down</i>

48
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,779
<i>And I</i>

49
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:13,051
<i>I want you to meet</i>

50
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:15,218
<i>Meet my baby</i>

51
00:05:16,095 --> 00:05:18,996
<i>That's when we kiss and kiss and kiss</i>

52
00:05:19,432 --> 00:05:21,127
<i>Then we kiss some more</i>

53
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:24,100
<i>Who cares how many times we kiss?</i>

54
00:05:24,203 --> 00:05:27,297
<i>Well, at a time like this</i>
<i>who keeps score?</i>

55
00:05:27,406 --> 00:05:29,874
<i>I don't care if the sun don't shine</i>

56
00:05:30,109 --> 00:05:32,304
<i>I get my loving in the evening time</i>

57
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:36,871
<i>- When I'm with my baby</i>
<i>- I'm with my baby</i>

58
00:05:38,417 --> 00:05:44,378
<i>Pretty baby of mine</i>

59
00:05:47,693 --> 00:05:49,684
Where is Pierre?
All of his tables are full,

60
00:05:49,795 --> 00:05:51,126
and there is no Pierre to wait on them.

61
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,663
Please don't get excited.

62
00:05:52,765 --> 00:05:54,892
Pierre has been here,
then Pierre disappeared.

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,627
- But I arrange everything.
- How?

64
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:59,204
I sent Myron
to take care of Pierre's tables.

65
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:01,671
- Myron? Myron the busboy?
- Yes.

66
00:06:01,774 --> 00:06:03,469
- You put a busboy on Pierre's tables?
- Yes.

67
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:04,668
Where is he?

68
00:06:04,777 --> 00:06:06,506
He just went out
with an order of spaghetti.

69
00:06:06,612 --> 00:06:07,738
Oh, no.

70
00:06:20,326 --> 00:06:23,124
<i>In my estimation</i>

71
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:25,760
<i>I had to call</i>

72
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:29,200
<i>'cause you've got so much on the ball</i>

73
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:31,269
<i>You hit the spot</i>

74
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:34,302
<i>Like the first embrace</i>
<i>when the knot is tied</i>

75
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:36,840
<i>Well, you hit the spot</i>

76
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:40,001
<i>Like a pipe and slippers by a fireside</i>

77
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:43,213
<i>Matter of factly, don't know exactly</i>

78
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:45,340
<i>what it is that you've got</i>

79
00:06:45,818 --> 00:06:50,812
<i>But you hit the spot</i>

80
00:06:51,824 --> 00:06:53,758
<i>You hit the spot</i>

81
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:56,987
<i>Like a balmy breeze on a night in May</i>

82
00:06:57,096 --> 00:06:58,961
<i>You hit the spot</i>

83
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:02,601
<i>Like a cool mint julep on a summery day</i>

84
00:07:03,235 --> 00:07:05,260
<i>You hit a new high</i>

85
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:07,896
<i>In my estimation</i>

86
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:10,506
<i>I had to fall</i>

87
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:11,803
You, busboy!

88
00:07:11,911 --> 00:07:15,608
I'm sorry, sir, but you know I'm nervous.
I could have spilled everything all...

89
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,315
Oh, shut up.

90
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:26,290
I'll get something to clean it up
right away, and don't you do a thing.

91
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:33,623
Oh, there you are. He's gonna get
something to clean you up right away.

92
00:07:33,732 --> 00:07:36,200
I'm awfully sorry, sir, but I'm nervous,

93
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:38,736
and the man yelled
when I served the spaghetti.

94
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:41,329
- I'm not too well, anyhow.
- Hey!

95
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:46,377
Hey, hey! I'm not bothering you, am I?

96
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:50,174
Oh, no, sir. I'm just trying
to get this straightened out.

97
00:07:51,283 --> 00:07:54,013
You don't mind if I finish my number,
do you?

98
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:56,679
- Oh, is the show on?
- No. I'm waiting for a bus.

99
00:07:56,822 --> 00:07:59,347
Well, you're in the wrong place, buddy.
It's about three blocks down...

100
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,619
Oh, get out of here.
Let me finish my number.

101
00:08:01,727 --> 00:08:02,853
You know what? I'll get that, lady.

102
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:06,864
- Oh, get out of here.
- Lady, the show is on, lady. I'll get this.

103
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:08,524
Just hold still.

104
00:08:10,236 --> 00:08:11,533
You idiot!

105
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:17,339
- Who do you think you're pushing?
- Get away from me!

106
00:08:17,443 --> 00:08:20,571
- I'm going to get the manager!
- I want the manager!

107
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:23,739
- I want the manager!
- Oh, yeah? The show is on air!

108
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:27,341
I was bringing the spaghetti,
and I fell down, that's all.

109
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:31,578
Hello.

110
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,783
It seems you like to get laughs
around here.

111
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:35,952
- Oh, no, this wasn't... Laughs?
- Yeah.

112
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:37,050
Oh, sure.

113
00:08:37,162 --> 00:08:39,494
Well, how would you like to get
a few laughs with me on the floor?

114
00:08:39,598 --> 00:08:40,895
- What would I do there?
- I'll show you.

115
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,935
- What about this?
- I'll clean you up later.

116
00:08:45,571 --> 00:08:47,766
- Now, you ready?
- Yeah, what do we do?

117
00:08:47,873 --> 00:08:51,138
Well, we'll do a very dramatic scene
where you play the debonair, suave...

118
00:08:51,243 --> 00:08:55,202
- Oh, I'm a debonair slob.
- No, suave, S-L-O-B. Suave.

119
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:59,015
Now what we need is a girl. Rosie?

120
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:03,287
Myron, this is Rosie. Rosie, Myron.

121
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:07,222
All right, easy, easy.

122
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,557
Down, boy.

123
00:09:13,165 --> 00:09:14,894
Hey, you want me to walk you around
for an hour?

124
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,194
No, I'll be all right.

125
00:09:16,302 --> 00:09:18,497
All right. Now you take her in your arms
and you kiss her.

126
00:09:18,604 --> 00:09:21,505
- How do you feel about that?
- Oh, I like it. I like it.

127
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:23,040
I thought so. I knew you would.

128
00:09:23,142 --> 00:09:24,769
No, wait. No, wait for the cue!

129
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:27,641
When I say "ready," then you kiss her.
Wait for the cue.

130
00:09:27,746 --> 00:09:31,443
All right, now you get set now. When
I say... Easy, not yet. When I tell you!

131
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,280
I'm anxious. I'm all excited.

132
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:37,219
Okay, now I'm the husband,
you're the lover and this is my wife.

133
00:09:37,323 --> 00:09:40,121
I come home unexpectedly,
and I find you kissing her, all right?

134
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:41,886
Not yet. Wait till I say "go." All right?

135
00:09:41,994 --> 00:09:43,018
Go!

136
00:09:44,663 --> 00:09:46,995
My best friend kissing my best wife...
My wife.

137
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:48,361
Well, no...

138
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:55,939
- Save him! Oh, save him!
- Wait, wait, wait!

139
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,099
Wait!

140
00:09:57,443 --> 00:10:00,003
- What's the matter?
- This is a good part you gave me.

141
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:02,512
- You don't like it?
- No, I don't like it.

142
00:10:02,614 --> 00:10:05,344
- What part would you like?
- Your part.

143
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:07,116
- Oh, you want to be the husband?
- Yeah.

144
00:10:07,219 --> 00:10:08,550
- All right, I'll be the lover.
- Right.

145
00:10:08,654 --> 00:10:10,884
All right, now we'll pick up
right where we left off.

146
00:10:11,023 --> 00:10:13,423
No, you've already hit me.
I'm down here. See?

147
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,220
- Did I hurt you?
- No.

148
00:10:15,327 --> 00:10:16,624
- No.
- I get up and I say,

149
00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:18,526
- boy, you got a lot of nerve.
- No!

150
00:10:19,798 --> 00:10:23,632
- Oh, no!
- Wait, wait, wait!

151
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:28,105
- All right.
- Wait!

152
00:10:28,207 --> 00:10:30,801
- What in the...
- I don't like that part, either.

153
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:34,009
Well, there's only one part left,
and that's Rosie's.

154
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:36,377
- I'll take it.
- All right, you be Rosie,

155
00:10:36,482 --> 00:10:38,780
Rosie will be Myron,
and I'll be the husband.

156
00:10:38,884 --> 00:10:41,250
And we'll pick up right where we left off.

157
00:10:41,353 --> 00:10:43,378
See? I get up and I say,

158
00:10:44,056 --> 00:10:47,890
Myron, we shouldn't fight like this.
We've been friends too long.

159
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:52,597
- You're right, Larry.
- And besides, it's all her fault.

160
00:10:53,432 --> 00:10:56,401
No, no, no, wait!

161
00:10:56,535 --> 00:10:59,527
Wait, wait, wait!

162
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:01,428
Come on, Myron.

163
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:05,043
- He's just a troublemaker, anyhow.
- You're right, Larry.

164
00:11:06,345 --> 00:11:08,176
I don't know what I'm going
to do with you, Myron.

165
00:11:08,313 --> 00:11:10,873
You don't know? You've already done it.

166
00:11:10,983 --> 00:11:14,783
Oh, look, Myron, we've been friends
a lot of years, ever since we were kids.

167
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:17,856
You made a fool out of me, Larry,
and I'm hurt.

168
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:20,817
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you.

169
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:25,586
I like you. We're buddies, aren't we?

170
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:30,933
<i>I'm your chum</i>

171
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:32,765
I forgot. You're my chum.

172
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:34,634
<i>I'm your friend</i>

173
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,072
<i>Through thin and through thick</i>

174
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:38,438
<i>I'm your pal</i>

175
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:40,603
<i>That's right, you're my pal</i>

176
00:11:40,712 --> 00:11:42,202
<i>Till you die</i>

177
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:45,348
- Already I'm sick.
- Which reminds me.

178
00:11:45,851 --> 00:11:49,150
<i>When you were sick</i>
<i>remember how I nursed you?</i>

179
00:11:49,788 --> 00:11:52,689
<i>Stayed by your side</i>
<i>and wouldn't go away</i>

180
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:54,549
Yeah.

181
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,390
<i>But what have you done for me lately?</i>

182
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,261
<i>What did you do for me today?</i>

183
00:11:59,364 --> 00:12:02,925
Today? Every day, everywhere I go,
I find something for you.

184
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:05,401
And every time you let me down.
Now, take tonight.

185
00:12:05,504 --> 00:12:07,904
I get you a job as a busboy,
and what are you doing?

186
00:12:08,006 --> 00:12:10,839
- You're waiting on tables.
- Well, they told me to do that, Larry.

187
00:12:10,943 --> 00:12:12,740
I was taking Pierre's place.

188
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:14,642
- And where was Pierre?
- Oh, he got in trouble.

189
00:12:14,746 --> 00:12:16,771
He was kissing one of the girls
in the show.

190
00:12:16,882 --> 00:12:19,874
That shouldn't get him in trouble.
I kiss some of the girls in the show.

191
00:12:19,985 --> 00:12:21,350
Yeah, but he picked the wrong one.

192
00:12:21,453 --> 00:12:23,853
This one happened to belong
to the Big Boy.

193
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:25,446
- You mean Shorty?
- Yeah. Could you imagine?

194
00:12:25,557 --> 00:12:28,788
Of all the girls in the line, he gotta pick
Shorty's girl to play around with.

195
00:12:28,894 --> 00:12:30,156
They were dancing
in a telephone booth,

196
00:12:30,262 --> 00:12:32,321
and one of Shorty's men saw them.

197
00:12:32,431 --> 00:12:34,092
- Telephone booth?
- Yeah.

198
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:35,894
What a dope. What happened to him?

199
00:12:36,034 --> 00:12:38,764
I don't know. A couple of Shorty's men
came over and took him away.

200
00:12:38,871 --> 00:12:40,065
- They took him away?
- Yeah.

201
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:43,141
- Which girl was it?
- This one.

202
00:12:44,476 --> 00:12:45,636
Oh, no!

203
00:12:46,512 --> 00:12:49,140
- Why, what's the matter, sweetie?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

204
00:12:49,915 --> 00:12:51,109
Bye.

205
00:12:52,584 --> 00:12:53,881
Excuse me.

206
00:12:55,087 --> 00:12:57,112
So what's the matter with him?

207
00:12:57,222 --> 00:12:59,713
I just told him about you and Pierre.

208
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:01,690
Oh, you did, did you?

209
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,396
You better get out of here
before Shorty finds out about Larry, too.

210
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:08,932
Yeah? Well, it's too late,
'cause he found out already.

211
00:13:10,435 --> 00:13:12,460
- He did?
- Yeah, he did.

212
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:17,406
Oh, I'd better answer that.
It might be a phone call.

213
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:20,541
Hello? Hello?

214
00:13:20,946 --> 00:13:23,141
I want to talk to Larry Todd.

215
00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:25,515
<i>He isn't in.</i>

216
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:29,552
Well, tell him to get over to my hotel
as soon as he gets off.

217
00:13:29,655 --> 00:13:32,522
- I wanna have a little talk with him.
- Who's this?

218
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:36,759
Shorty?

219
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:39,520
It's Shorty.

220
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:42,256
Shorty. Yeah.

221
00:13:42,634 --> 00:13:44,261
Yeah. I...

222
00:13:45,804 --> 00:13:50,104
I'll tell him. Sure, Shorty.

223
00:13:51,677 --> 00:13:55,204
- As soon as he comes in.
- I'll be expecting him.

224
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:01,786
Mr. Todd will be with us very soon.

225
00:14:02,054 --> 00:14:04,147
Yeah, but not for very long.

226
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:08,959
- Oh, poor Larry.
- Hey!

227
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:11,353
Why don't you go talk to Shorty?

228
00:14:11,496 --> 00:14:15,455
Larry's always doing things for you.
Now is your chance to pay him back.

229
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:18,798
You're right. Larry's always been
like a big brother to me,

230
00:14:19,238 --> 00:14:21,433
and I'm always messing him up.

231
00:14:22,274 --> 00:14:25,766
Say, this would be my big chance
to even the score, huh?

232
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:27,642
I'll do it.

233
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:31,515
That's a boy.

234
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:37,213
Don't tell Shorty.

235
00:14:38,223 --> 00:14:41,351
Shorty. Shorty!

236
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:45,519
Down for eight.

237
00:14:47,432 --> 00:14:49,161
There they go again.

238
00:14:50,102 --> 00:14:54,061
Hey, Frankie. Go down and see if they
ain't gonna do something about this.

239
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:55,469
All right.

240
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:11,588
The whole hotel is in darkness.

241
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,658
Hello? Hello.

242
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:17,289
Oh, operator,
the lights in my room are... What?

243
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:20,061
Oh, I see.

244
00:15:20,732 --> 00:15:23,360
Well, do you suppose I could get
some sort of light up here?

245
00:15:23,468 --> 00:15:27,165
I'm leaving for Cuba tonight,
and I still have packing to do.

246
00:15:27,806 --> 00:15:29,740
Oh, that'll be fine. Thanks.

247
00:15:31,176 --> 00:15:33,076
They're sending up some candles.

248
00:15:33,178 --> 00:15:36,511
- At what time does your plane leave?
- Oh, I'm not flying.

249
00:15:36,948 --> 00:15:38,677
It's much too quick.

250
00:15:39,117 --> 00:15:42,780
I've always looked forward
to a wonderful cruise to Havana.

251
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,525
Exciting, isn't it?

252
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:06,642
- I hope these will help, Miss Carroll.
- Oh, they will. Thanks.

253
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:08,303
Hold it, sister.

254
00:16:09,514 --> 00:16:11,744
It's like Christmas, ain't it?

255
00:16:14,252 --> 00:16:16,345
More like the Fourth of July.

256
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:18,719
- Nice night for a murder.
- Yeah.

257
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:25,185
- Hey, how did you know?
- I didn't.

258
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:29,823
I didn't.
I just said it'd be a nice night for one.

259
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:38,273
You will have to get used to candles,
Miss Carroll.

260
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:40,777
There's no electricity on Lost Island.

261
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:44,781
The castle today is exactly
as your great-great-grandfather built it.

262
00:16:44,883 --> 00:16:47,613
You mean the ghosts still have to find
their way around in the dark?

263
00:16:47,753 --> 00:16:49,243
How depressing.

264
00:16:49,888 --> 00:16:52,982
You may joke, my dear,
but unfortunately the legends

265
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:55,992
about the castle
are not to be taken lightly.

266
00:16:56,128 --> 00:16:57,595
Oh, come now.

267
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,257
You don't really believe in ghosts,
do you?

268
00:17:00,365 --> 00:17:03,596
I know that as the executor
of your grandfather's estate,

269
00:17:03,702 --> 00:17:07,433
I'm supposed to paint the castle
as a palm-fringed paradise.

270
00:17:08,907 --> 00:17:11,808
But I also know
that during the last 20 years,

271
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,446
no human being who tried to spend
a night in Black Castle

272
00:17:15,547 --> 00:17:17,640
ever lived to see a sunrise.

273
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:27,747
Well, and not a moment too soon.

274
00:17:28,727 --> 00:17:30,388
Now I can finish my packing.

275
00:17:30,495 --> 00:17:34,829
Miss Carroll, I urge you to accept
the offer I've been authorized to make.

276
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:37,458
Now, $50,000 is quite a bit of money.

277
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,261
It's such a strange offer.

278
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:43,831
The place is haunted, full of bats,

279
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:47,540
and yet somebody wants it,
$50,000 worth.

280
00:17:48,313 --> 00:17:50,804
Who's making the offer, Mr. Cortega?

281
00:17:51,516 --> 00:17:53,882
I'm sorry, I can't tell you that.

282
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,785
Hello? Yes.

283
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,960
- Who?
- You don't know me, Miss Carroll.

284
00:18:04,062 --> 00:18:06,496
My name is Cariso, Ramon Cariso.

285
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:10,960
I want to warn you
against selling your castle to Cortega.

286
00:18:11,203 --> 00:18:12,795
What did you say?

287
00:18:13,905 --> 00:18:16,169
Well, not right now. Where are you?

288
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:19,704
I'm near your hotel.
When may I see you?

289
00:18:20,712 --> 00:18:22,907
- In 20 minutes?
- I'll be there.

290
00:18:23,648 --> 00:18:26,048
In the meantime, be cautious.

291
00:18:30,822 --> 00:18:33,484
Oh, I want to show you a map
of the island.

292
00:18:36,561 --> 00:18:39,029
Lost Island is certainly
an out-of-the-way place, isn't it?

293
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,461
Yes, it is.

294
00:18:40,832 --> 00:18:42,424
And since
it does not belong to any country,

295
00:18:42,534 --> 00:18:44,764
there are no established
trade routes to it.

296
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,771
It's more or less
part of the Greater Antilles,

297
00:18:47,873 --> 00:18:50,933
but the easiest way to reach it
is from Havana.

298
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,645
What do you wish to do about the offer,
Miss Carroll?

299
00:18:54,746 --> 00:18:57,010
Must I decide now, this minute?

300
00:18:57,782 --> 00:19:01,013
Anything over $4 calls for deep thought
on my part.

301
00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:04,849
Take your time. Until sailing time.

302
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:07,351
- Thank you.
- And I hope you'll change your mind.

303
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:11,122
I'll be in my room down the hall
if you want to reach me.

304
00:19:12,197 --> 00:19:14,358
Leave your door open,
and your motor running.

305
00:19:14,466 --> 00:19:17,162
- I might be coming out in a hurry.
- Okay.

306
00:19:23,174 --> 00:19:24,505
Oh, thank you.

307
00:19:39,424 --> 00:19:42,450
I'll tell that Shorty guy.
He can't hurt Larry,

308
00:19:44,162 --> 00:19:46,960
not while Larry has friends
like Big Myron.

309
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,734
I'll go right in there and I'll say to him,
"Shorty, listen here.

310
00:19:54,005 --> 00:19:57,964
"If you hurt one hair on Larry's head,
you'll have to deal with me.

311
00:19:58,343 --> 00:20:01,779
"So you better watch your step,
'cause I'm a killer."

312
00:20:04,182 --> 00:20:05,740
You're a killer?

313
00:20:07,352 --> 00:20:09,252
I better think this thing over.

314
00:20:09,354 --> 00:20:10,480
Myron.

315
00:20:14,092 --> 00:20:15,059
Myron.

316
00:20:18,363 --> 00:20:19,387
Me?

317
00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:26,667
Who are you, Dr. Coffee Nerves?

318
00:20:26,771 --> 00:20:29,365
No. I am the voice of your conscience.

319
00:20:29,908 --> 00:20:32,934
You are not going to run out on Larry,
are you?

320
00:20:33,111 --> 00:20:36,774
Remember, he's your best friend,
and he's in trouble.

321
00:20:37,015 --> 00:20:39,381
Now you go in there and show that gang

322
00:20:39,484 --> 00:20:41,577
that you're just as tough as they are.

323
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,848
I can't go in there and fight
that whole mob. They got guns.

324
00:20:44,956 --> 00:20:46,548
You can get a gun.

325
00:20:46,658 --> 00:20:47,920
They got blackjacks.

326
00:20:48,026 --> 00:20:49,891
You can get a blackjack.

327
00:20:49,995 --> 00:20:52,020
They got big, strong muscles.

328
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:54,097
You can get a blackjack.

329
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:56,794
No. I can't do it and I won't do it.

330
00:20:56,935 --> 00:21:00,063
Oh, it's easy, Myron.
All you have to do is be tough.

331
00:21:00,705 --> 00:21:02,400
Oh, you mean like this?

332
00:21:02,507 --> 00:21:05,601
All right, you guys,
line up against that wall.

333
00:21:08,513 --> 00:21:10,447
He wants me to be tough.

334
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:35,362
Myron. Myron. Myron!

335
00:21:37,842 --> 00:21:40,310
That's tough enough. Now get going.

336
00:21:45,684 --> 00:21:48,551
- Myron.
- Oh, I'm going. Stop rushing me.

337
00:21:55,727 --> 00:21:57,160
Hurry, Myron.

338
00:21:59,097 --> 00:22:00,792
I forgot what I was supposed to do.

339
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:03,333
Oh, Myron, I'm at my wit's end with you.

340
00:22:03,435 --> 00:22:05,562
You're supposed to help Larry, right?

341
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,695
Well, go in there and be tough.

342
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:10,331
Show them you're boss. Assert yourself.

343
00:22:10,442 --> 00:22:11,909
You know what you've got to do.

344
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,205
Now get going. Show them who's boss,

345
00:22:14,345 --> 00:22:16,939
don't take no for an answer,
tell them what you want,

346
00:22:17,048 --> 00:22:19,346
and see that it's done
the way you want it.

347
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:21,885
Now get going and don't come back.

348
00:22:21,986 --> 00:22:23,613
Get going already!

349
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:36,993
Stop stalling. Get going.

350
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:56,150
Somebody's gotta move.

351
00:23:04,162 --> 00:23:06,756
Pretty nice hideout youse guys got here.

352
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,809
Now get out of the way!

353
00:23:19,577 --> 00:23:22,876
Hey, when I say "get out of the way,"
I mean it.

354
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:30,411
Now which one of you is the Shorty?

355
00:23:35,827 --> 00:23:37,556
Listen here, Shorty,

356
00:23:37,862 --> 00:23:40,330
I want you and your guys
to lay off Larry Todd.

357
00:23:40,431 --> 00:23:42,991
Happens to be
a personal friend of mine.

358
00:23:43,101 --> 00:23:45,865
Anybody that fools with him
is gonna have to answer to me.

359
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:46,994
See?

360
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:56,110
And furthermore, I want you...

361
00:23:56,848 --> 00:24:00,716
Hey, let's pay attention, buddy.
When someone's talk...

362
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:03,647
Hey, Pierre! Hey, Pierre, it's me, Myron.

363
00:24:03,755 --> 00:24:05,746
We were worried about you.

364
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:07,654
He's dead.

365
00:24:09,127 --> 00:24:11,789
- Oh, honey.
- Now look, baby, it's just like I said.

366
00:24:11,896 --> 00:24:13,295
We're all washed up.

367
00:24:13,398 --> 00:24:15,059
I don't mind competing
with a French waiter,

368
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:18,795
but when it comes to double-crossing
the Big Boy, you can include me out.

369
00:24:18,903 --> 00:24:21,394
Oh, Larry,
they don't mean anything to me.

370
00:24:21,506 --> 00:24:23,531
Besides, Pierre's disappeared,

371
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:26,007
and Myron's taking care of Shorty
right now.

372
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,840
- Myron's what?
- He's gone over to Shorty's.

373
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:30,812
He's gonna tell him to leave you alone.

374
00:24:30,915 --> 00:24:33,884
Why, that crazy kid. Shorty'll kill him.

375
00:24:35,153 --> 00:24:37,781
Well, better him than you, sweetie.

376
00:24:38,122 --> 00:24:39,885
Now, lay off, Rosie.

377
00:24:40,058 --> 00:24:42,151
Why didn't you tell me this before?

378
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,319
It's probably too late, now.

379
00:24:46,164 --> 00:24:49,133
Water. Water.

380
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:54,466
Thank you.

381
00:24:54,639 --> 00:24:56,664
Let's have it, buster.
What's your racket?

382
00:24:56,808 --> 00:24:58,935
- Who sent you here?
- Did Larry Todd send you?

383
00:24:59,043 --> 00:25:00,067
Come on and talk!

384
00:25:00,178 --> 00:25:02,043
What do you know
about Larry and Rosie?

385
00:25:02,146 --> 00:25:03,408
How long they been going together?

386
00:25:03,514 --> 00:25:04,913
Whose mob you with?

387
00:25:05,016 --> 00:25:06,643
How come you don't pack a rod, buster?

388
00:25:06,751 --> 00:25:07,740
You ever been in the pen?

389
00:25:07,852 --> 00:25:11,253
If you wanna get out of here
in one piece, you'd better sing.

390
00:25:11,356 --> 00:25:13,551
You heard him, ape head. Sing!

391
00:25:14,292 --> 00:25:17,557
- All right, I'll sing.
- And you better make it good.

392
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:22,823
<i>Just one more chance to</i>

393
00:25:22,934 --> 00:25:25,767
Okay, wise guy, you asked for it.

394
00:25:26,671 --> 00:25:28,195
Which way is 1401?

395
00:25:28,306 --> 00:25:29,933
Straight down the hall
and turn to the left.

396
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:31,338
Thank you.

397
00:25:41,052 --> 00:25:42,610
- Is that you?
- What?

398
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,280
- No, it's not me.
- I'm very sorry.

399
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,481
It's all right. Forget it.

400
00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:49,459
What a joint.

401
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:58,731
Hot and cold running gangsters.

402
00:26:18,957 --> 00:26:21,653
So you thought
you'd get away with it, huh?

403
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:33,337
Somebody tipped the cops.

404
00:26:53,992 --> 00:26:55,016
Myron!

405
00:26:55,126 --> 00:26:57,185
- Oh, this is it.
- This is what?

406
00:26:57,295 --> 00:27:01,561
Don't confuse me.
Oh, Larry, why'd you do it?

407
00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:04,032
Come on, let's get out of here.
There's nothing wrong with you.

408
00:27:04,135 --> 00:27:07,798
Nothing wrong with me?
Everybody bleeds like this?

409
00:27:17,982 --> 00:27:20,246
Come on, let's get out of here.

410
00:27:20,351 --> 00:27:22,376
Oh! Bye.

411
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,213
Back up. Get in there. Quick! Quick!

412
00:27:52,316 --> 00:27:54,682
Get in there, I tell you. Get in.

413
00:27:54,852 --> 00:27:57,480
I just came in to borrow a cup of sugar.

414
00:27:57,588 --> 00:28:00,853
- What is this?
- Don't talk. Especially, don't scream.

415
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:04,724
If there's gonna be any
hysterics around here, I'll have them.

416
00:28:06,697 --> 00:28:10,030
Put it down, sister.
Put it down and stand still.

417
00:28:11,803 --> 00:28:14,363
Look, if this is another attempt
to scare me into selling the island,

418
00:28:14,472 --> 00:28:16,997
- it just won't work.
- I'm not buying an island, lady.

419
00:28:17,108 --> 00:28:18,803
I'm headed for one.

420
00:28:19,811 --> 00:28:21,972
Don't move.

421
00:28:22,146 --> 00:28:25,206
- Say, you're really terrified, aren't you?
- How can you tell?

422
00:28:25,316 --> 00:28:28,376
I don't mind dying, lady.
It's the preliminaries I hate.

423
00:28:28,486 --> 00:28:30,454
You'd better put down that gun.
The way you're shaking

424
00:28:30,555 --> 00:28:33,991
- you might shoot someone.
- That's the trouble. I already did.

425
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:37,687
- You did?
- I feel the same way about it, lady.

426
00:28:41,432 --> 00:28:43,263
You better sit down before you collapse.

427
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:45,835
Thanks. I think my blood's
running the wrong way,

428
00:28:45,937 --> 00:28:47,495
if it's running.

429
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:50,664
- Who'd you shoot?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

430
00:28:51,242 --> 00:28:53,335
You mean you killed a perfect stranger?

431
00:28:53,478 --> 00:28:56,447
- Nobody's perfect.
- Why'd you shoot him?

432
00:28:56,614 --> 00:28:58,479
- He was shooting at me.
- Oh.

433
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:01,312
Well, isn't that self-defense?

434
00:29:01,552 --> 00:29:05,682
Lady, when you kill one of Shorty's men,
it's suicide.

435
00:29:08,993 --> 00:29:11,427
You wouldn't be Ramon Cariso,
would you?

436
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:13,997
Right now,
I'd like to be anybody but Larry Todd.

437
00:29:14,098 --> 00:29:15,963
Stand back! Keep it clear here!

438
00:29:28,146 --> 00:29:29,408
Larry.

439
00:29:29,514 --> 00:29:31,379
All right, photograph him the way he is.

440
00:29:31,516 --> 00:29:33,643
Oh, let me through, please.
Let me through.

441
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:37,084
- Do you know him?
- Do I know him? My best friend.

442
00:29:37,188 --> 00:29:39,588
I worked with him. I sang with him.
I ate with him.

443
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,591
- And you want to know if I know him?
- Do you?

444
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,422
- No, I don't know him.
- Get out of here!

445
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,160
Come on, people, back up, now.
We got work to do. Come on.

446
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,392
- Is he dead?
- No. He's waiting for a room.

447
00:29:54,772 --> 00:29:56,831
- Gangway, please.
- All right, all right. Come on.

448
00:29:56,941 --> 00:30:00,638
Make room for them.
Let them get the stretcher through here.

449
00:30:01,546 --> 00:30:03,480
You say you never saw
that man before?

450
00:30:03,581 --> 00:30:05,242
- No.
- This woman says

451
00:30:05,349 --> 00:30:08,477
she saw a tall man wearing
a trench coat and a polka-dot scarf

452
00:30:08,586 --> 00:30:11,248
- running down the hall. Is that right?
- I certainly did.

453
00:30:11,355 --> 00:30:14,586
- He ran right down that way.
- And you didn't see or hear anything?

454
00:30:14,692 --> 00:30:16,319
- No, I didn't.
- Oh.

455
00:30:16,561 --> 00:30:18,620
Well, come on, get back to your rooms.
Go on, folks.

456
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:20,162
Get back to your rooms and stay there.

457
00:30:20,264 --> 00:30:21,993
- Sergeant, are all the exits covered?
- Yes, sir.

458
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:25,865
Come on, boys, search every room.
You come with me, Thompson.

459
00:30:27,605 --> 00:30:30,506
It's the police.
They're searching the rooms.

460
00:30:30,608 --> 00:30:32,041
Don't give me away, please.

461
00:30:32,143 --> 00:30:34,475
Someday you may have a little boy,
and he'll grow up

462
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:38,106
- and commit an innocent murder, too.
- But what can I do?

463
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:40,909
You're going to make me miss my boat.

464
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:43,148
- Who is it?
- Police.

465
00:30:44,455 --> 00:30:46,423
Quick, get under the bed.

466
00:30:47,091 --> 00:30:48,649
Wait, take this.

467
00:30:50,828 --> 00:30:53,228
Just a moment, please. I'm coming.

468
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:09,106
Sorry, miss. We're making a check up
of all the rooms,

469
00:31:09,213 --> 00:31:12,148
- trying to locate a killer.
- A killer? What...

470
00:31:13,684 --> 00:31:15,879
- Do I seem like...
- There's nothing personal about this.

471
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:18,547
- I just want to look around.
- Certainly.

472
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:45,242
- Is this the bedroom?
- Yes, but there's nobody in there.

473
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:48,250
There never is. I'll have a look, anyway.

474
00:32:21,952 --> 00:32:23,419
- Miss?
- Yes?

475
00:32:23,988 --> 00:32:26,479
Will you come here a minute, please?

476
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:33,957
I see your baggage is all out.
You just arriving or leaving?

477
00:32:34,065 --> 00:32:36,465
Oh, I'm leaving.

478
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:39,900
Taking a boat tonight.

479
00:32:40,304 --> 00:32:43,171
- You've got your ticket, I presume.
- Ticket?

480
00:32:43,674 --> 00:32:46,666
- Oh, yes. It's in there, on the desk.
- I'll have a look.

481
00:32:46,777 --> 00:32:50,440
Oh, I'll get it for you.
Right there in the big brown envelope.

482
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,640
All right, Sergeant,
check the other boys.

483
00:32:54,752 --> 00:32:55,980
Yes, sir.

484
00:33:10,501 --> 00:33:12,128
What's the matter?
Have you lost something?

485
00:33:12,536 --> 00:33:15,630
No. I was just scratching.

486
00:33:17,775 --> 00:33:19,766
Excuse me, Miss Carroll.
Can I get your trunk?

487
00:33:19,877 --> 00:33:21,276
- I'm busy at the moment.
- I know, miss,

488
00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:23,472
but if I don't take it now,
it might not make the boat.

489
00:33:23,581 --> 00:33:25,412
- Is it all right, Officer?
- Sure. Go ahead.

490
00:33:25,516 --> 00:33:29,043
- It's in the bedroom. Lock it first, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

491
00:33:30,621 --> 00:33:33,590
I'm sorry to bother you this way,
but that's the routine.

492
00:33:33,691 --> 00:33:36,819
Oh, it's quite all right,
and I'm sure you'll find your man.

493
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:37,951
I know one thing.

494
00:33:38,062 --> 00:33:41,122
He'll never get off this floor
unless he jumps.

495
00:33:55,112 --> 00:33:56,875
You can come out now.

496
00:33:58,048 --> 00:33:59,515
Where are you?

497
00:34:12,029 --> 00:34:14,020
- Who are you?
- I'm Myron.

498
00:34:14,465 --> 00:34:16,660
- Where's Larry?
- I said who are you?

499
00:34:16,767 --> 00:34:19,201
Oh, Myron M. Mertz.
Well, what did you do with Larry?

500
00:34:19,303 --> 00:34:22,932
- Myron M. Mertz?
- Yes. The "M" stands for Myron, too.

501
00:34:23,274 --> 00:34:25,401
Your name is Myron Myron?

502
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:28,037
Yes, you see, when I was a little boy,
I was awful.

503
00:34:28,145 --> 00:34:31,979
And when my mother called me,
she had to say, "Myron, Myron!"

504
00:34:32,116 --> 00:34:35,017
- So it's Myron Myron.
- You're crazy.

505
00:34:35,853 --> 00:34:38,481
- I'm getting the police.
- Oh, no. Don't do that, lady.

506
00:34:38,589 --> 00:34:42,320
You'll get Larry and me in trouble,
and Larry is my best friend.

507
00:34:42,426 --> 00:34:45,759
- Just tell me where he is.
- I don't know where he is.

508
00:34:46,964 --> 00:34:48,795
He's hiding somewhere.

509
00:34:50,501 --> 00:34:52,901
- Mr. Todd!
- Larry!

510
00:34:53,904 --> 00:34:57,533
Larry, come out, wherever you are.

511
00:35:04,515 --> 00:35:08,246
My good dresses,
and I packed them so carefully.

512
00:35:09,153 --> 00:35:10,586
- Good heavens!
- What's the matter?

513
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:13,054
- My trunk. He's in my trunk.
- Well, let's get him out.

514
00:35:13,157 --> 00:35:14,749
- I'll phone the porter.
- Oh, no, don't do that.

515
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:17,327
He's got to get out of here somehow,
and the hotel is surrounded.

516
00:35:17,428 --> 00:35:19,419
Well, we've got to get him
out of that trunk. Find it.

517
00:35:19,597 --> 00:35:21,758
It's got my initials on it.
M.C., Mary Carroll.

518
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:24,232
- Here are the keys and get him out.
- Oh, right.

519
00:35:24,335 --> 00:35:26,428
Wait a minute! Where did it go?

520
00:35:26,537 --> 00:35:29,005
The pier at Pier 54.
I'm sailing for Cuba tonight.

521
00:35:29,106 --> 00:35:31,836
Oh, Larry can't go to Cuba.
He's gotta go to work in a...

522
00:35:31,942 --> 00:35:33,034
Cuba!

523
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:38,772
Well, the Lieutenant wants to see
you guys right away. Hurry!

524
00:35:38,883 --> 00:35:40,441

537
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:30,459
Larry?

538
00:36:31,235 --> 00:36:32,202
Larry?

539
00:36:34,805 --> 00:36:36,272
Larry?

540
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:38,842
Larry?

541
00:36:44,982 --> 00:36:50,511
<i>Larry... me back to ol' Virginny</i>

542
00:36:51,322 --> 00:36:52,983
<i>Back</i>

543
00:36:53,223 --> 00:36:54,417
Larry!

544
00:36:56,627 --> 00:37:02,259
<i>I don't wanna walk without you, Larry</i>

545
00:37:02,733 --> 00:37:04,030
Larry?

546
00:37:07,671 --> 00:37:09,502
- Larry.
- Come in.

547
00:37:13,043 --> 00:37:15,944
Larry. Larry.

548
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:23,276
Gee, I'm glad to see you.
Are you all right, Larry?

549
00:37:23,387 --> 00:37:24,877
Get me out of here.

550
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:28,049
- Okay. How do you feel?
- I'll tell you when I unpack.

551
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:31,821
- Well, keep your chin up, pal.
- I can't. My knees are in the way.

552
00:37:32,396 --> 00:37:33,829
Oh, here they are.

553
00:37:34,264 --> 00:37:36,926
It'll just be a second, Larry. Hold on.

554
00:37:37,601 --> 00:37:38,966
I got it now.

555
00:37:40,971 --> 00:37:42,404
Here you are.

556
00:37:44,074 --> 00:37:46,634
Wow! Must've been pretty crowded
in there, huh?

557
00:37:46,744 --> 00:37:48,211
Oh, you can say that again.

558
00:37:48,345 --> 00:37:50,336
Wow! It must've been pretty crowded
in there, huh?

559
00:37:50,447 --> 00:37:52,278
Oh, why don't you shut up?

560
00:37:57,354 --> 00:37:58,787
- What's the matter?
- One of Shorty's men.

561
00:37:58,889 --> 00:38:00,618
He's looking for me.

562
00:38:06,597 --> 00:38:07,655
Is he coming?

563
00:38:07,765 --> 00:38:10,632
No, he's just standing there
looking around.

564
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,704
- Yeah, he's going now.
- Don't you worry.

565
00:38:14,805 --> 00:38:17,171
Because if he comes,
I'll stop him with one word.

566
00:38:17,307 --> 00:38:18,672
- What's that?
- Help!

567
00:38:18,776 --> 00:38:22,041
Now shut up, you idiot,
before you do get him down here.

568
00:38:24,548 --> 00:38:27,244
Hey, let me see you talk
to the trunk again.

569
00:38:27,351 --> 00:38:30,787
That was marvelous, positively terrific.

570
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:33,288
Never saw your lips move a bit.

571
00:38:33,424 --> 00:38:37,190
Boy, you're the greatest ventriloquist
I ever saw.

572
00:38:37,561 --> 00:38:39,153
Come on, do it again.

573
00:38:39,263 --> 00:38:41,424
Why don't you go home
and lie down on a sponge?

574
00:38:41,532 --> 00:38:44,763
All right,
I can be just as stubborn as you.

575
00:38:44,868 --> 00:38:48,133
I'm gonna stay right here
until you do it again.

576
00:38:48,305 --> 00:38:50,000
Get me out of here!

577
00:38:50,107 --> 00:38:53,634
Terrific! Positively terrific!

578
00:38:53,744 --> 00:38:55,211
Hey, what's going on here?

579
00:38:55,312 --> 00:38:57,280
This guy is sensational!

580
00:38:57,381 --> 00:39:00,282
Talks to the trunk
and makes the trunk talk back.

581
00:39:00,384 --> 00:39:02,443
It's nothing, Officer.
I'm a ventriloquist, that's all.

582
00:39:02,553 --> 00:39:04,544
Get me out of here, Larry!

583
00:39:05,222 --> 00:39:06,689
- See?
- Yeah, that's all right.

584
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,121
I didn't catch you at all. Do some more.

585
00:39:08,225 --> 00:39:10,250
Yeah, come on.
Do it some more, do it some more!

586
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,328
- No, I can't.
- What's going on out there?

587
00:39:12,429 --> 00:39:15,830
Myron, there's a nice
big policeman here. Say hello.

588
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:18,592
Oh, hello, nice big policeman.

589
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,462
That's all right!

590
00:39:21,872 --> 00:39:24,033
Takes a little practice.
I got to get on the boat.

591
00:39:24,141 --> 00:39:27,338
Just for the fun of it,
open it up and let's have a look inside.

592
00:39:27,444 --> 00:39:30,607
- No, I can't do that.
- Then I can. I want to see the little man!

593
00:39:30,714 --> 00:39:33,808
Oh, no! You don't want to let
the genie escape, do you?

594
00:39:34,518 --> 00:39:35,849
Hou-genie?

595
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:39,216
Yeah, you know, the spirit that gives
the power. The officer knows.

596
00:39:39,323 --> 00:39:41,689
You know, the little genie.
Get him out of here.

597
00:39:41,792 --> 00:39:43,783
Oh, the little genie. Yes.

598
00:39:44,061 --> 00:39:47,087
You don't want to let
the little genie escape, do you?

599
00:39:47,197 --> 00:39:50,360
Oh, no.
It's raining out and he'll get all wet.

600
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:51,627
That's right.

601
00:39:51,735 --> 00:39:55,432
You leave the man alone, now,
and go on back to your party, okay?

602
00:39:55,539 --> 00:39:57,973
- Well, I don't know.
- Oh, go on now.

603
00:40:00,043 --> 00:40:03,809
- Larry, I could've asphyxicated.
- Oh, you'll be all right.

604
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:08,374
So this is Myron.

605
00:40:08,886 --> 00:40:12,151
I always wanted to meet...

606
00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:17,026
Oh, he's no dummy! He's a spy!

607
00:40:17,294 --> 00:40:20,627
- Officer! Officer!
- Oh, come here. No!

608
00:40:21,031 --> 00:40:24,467
This is my dummy. Look at that. Look.

609
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:26,463
Sawdust.

610
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,538
- Look, it's a dummy.
- He's a big one.

611
00:40:29,673 --> 00:40:32,506
You don't know how big a dummy he is.
Look.

612
00:40:34,545 --> 00:40:37,173
- Genuine wood.
- Can I do that?

613
00:40:37,281 --> 00:40:39,579
Go ahead. Go ahead, be my guest.

614
00:40:54,431 --> 00:40:56,262
He don't like me.

615
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,995
Are you all right, Mr. Todd?

616
00:41:00,103 --> 00:41:01,934
That must've been a terrible experience.

617
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:03,199
You're darn tooting.

618
00:41:03,307 --> 00:41:06,105
Oh, this whole day has been
a terrible experience, except for you.

619
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:08,440
And I sure want to thank you
for all you've done.

620
00:41:08,545 --> 00:41:09,978
Larry! Larry!

621
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:15,415
- What is it? What's the matter?
- It's the gangsters.

622
00:41:40,711 --> 00:41:43,612
Watch it, buddy.
We got to load these trunks.

623
00:41:44,147 --> 00:41:45,580
Hold it, Sam.

624
00:42:00,097 --> 00:42:01,394
He's gone.

625
00:42:05,502 --> 00:42:07,868
My trunk. It's going on the boat!

626
00:42:15,746 --> 00:42:16,770
Wait!

627
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,971
Larry, let me out of here!

628
00:42:19,983 --> 00:42:22,713
- Larry!
- Come on.

629
00:42:22,853 --> 00:42:25,617
- Extra! Extra!
- Where am I going?

630
00:42:26,023 --> 00:42:27,786
Extra! Paper!

631
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:31,327
All about the polka-dot scarf murder!
Paper!

632
00:42:31,428 --> 00:42:34,124
Hey, give me a paper.

633
00:42:38,035 --> 00:42:40,629
Get your paper! Paper! Extra!

634
00:42:40,737 --> 00:42:44,195
Read all about it!

635
00:42:45,342 --> 00:42:47,936
- Come on, we've got to hurry.
- I sure do.

636
00:42:48,045 --> 00:42:51,173
- Get your paper! Paper!
- Look out, lady.

637
00:42:54,651 --> 00:42:58,052
You wait in the stateroom,
and I'll look for the trunk.

638
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,926
- Please be careful with that trunk.
- Yes, ma'am.

639
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:13,303
- Oh, now, it's upside-down.
- Oh, so it is.

640
00:43:13,937 --> 00:43:17,395
- Oh, please be careful.
- Well, I am, lady. I'm taking it easy.

641
00:43:17,507 --> 00:43:19,873
- There you are. Should I open it for you?
- Oh, no, thanks. I'll do it.

642
00:43:19,977 --> 00:43:21,968
- No trouble.
- That's all right.

643
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,842
Thank you very kindly,
and I hope you have a very pleasant...

644
00:43:23,947 --> 00:43:26,040
I will. I will. Thank you. Goodbye.

645
00:43:27,517 --> 00:43:30,486
- Myron, are you all right?
- Let me out of here!

646
00:43:30,587 --> 00:43:33,283
I can't. You or Larry must have the key.

647
00:43:37,894 --> 00:43:39,452
I can't find it.

648
00:43:39,863 --> 00:43:43,731
- There's another key in the top drawer.
- I'm in the top drawer.

649
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:48,601
Oh, I got it. Here it is.

650
00:44:00,684 --> 00:44:04,711
- Now I know what a sardine feels like.
- I'm terribly sorry, Myron.

651
00:44:06,056 --> 00:44:07,614
Hold it. There's somebody at the door.

652
00:44:07,724 --> 00:44:10,090
- Don't go away.
- Where am I going?

653
00:44:13,864 --> 00:44:16,128
- Why, Mr. Cortega.
- Miss Carroll.

654
00:44:17,734 --> 00:44:19,361
What's the matter?

655
00:44:27,144 --> 00:44:30,170
Miss Carroll, I must ask you a question
that may seem impertinent.

656
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,406
What is it?

657
00:44:31,515 --> 00:44:34,040
Someone telephoned you tonight
while I was in your room.

658
00:44:34,151 --> 00:44:37,018
I would like to have you tell me
who it was.

659
00:44:39,523 --> 00:44:40,956
Oh, excuse me.

660
00:44:42,459 --> 00:44:44,654
- Miss Carroll?
- Yes. Thank you.

661
00:45:00,477 --> 00:45:01,774
From an admirer?

662
00:45:01,878 --> 00:45:04,676
No, just a friend wishing me a safe trip.

663
00:45:04,915 --> 00:45:07,406
Safe? Is there any doubt about that?

664
00:45:08,285 --> 00:45:10,776
Now, about this person
who called you tonight.

665
00:45:10,887 --> 00:45:12,946
It was a man I didn't know.

666
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:15,758
He said his name was Ramon Cariso.

667
00:45:16,593 --> 00:45:17,787
Cariso?

668
00:45:17,994 --> 00:45:19,928
Did he mention my name
when he talked to you?

669
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:21,088
I don't remember.

670
00:45:21,198 --> 00:45:22,927
It is very important
that you do remember.

671
00:45:23,033 --> 00:45:24,967
Mr. Cortega, you really must go now.

672
00:45:25,068 --> 00:45:27,662
Thanks for all your trouble
coming down to see me off.

673
00:45:27,804 --> 00:45:30,602
See you off?
Why, my dear, I'm sailing with you.

674
00:45:30,707 --> 00:45:31,765
You're what?

675
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:36,710
I've decided to go home for a short visit.
My stateroom is right across the hall.

676
00:45:39,049 --> 00:45:41,540
The boat must be getting ready
to pull out.

677
00:45:41,651 --> 00:45:43,812
- All ashore that's going ashore.
- But they can't...

678
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,549
I mean, let's go up on deck
and wave goodbye.

679
00:45:49,426 --> 00:45:52,589
There certainly are a lot of people
going to Cuba.

680
00:46:16,786 --> 00:46:20,381
Oh, my back. Oh, pain! Oh, pain!

681
00:46:20,824 --> 00:46:24,555
My back. Larry!

682
00:46:26,863 --> 00:46:29,127
Oh, Larry! Pain! Oh, my back.

683
00:46:30,467 --> 00:46:32,367
Oh, my back. Larry!

684
00:46:33,303 --> 00:46:35,931
- Larry, help me. I can't get up.
- Well, what's the matter?

685
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:38,371
I'm a midget. Oh, I can't get up.

686
00:46:38,475 --> 00:46:40,739
No, you're just a little stiff.
Come on, loosen up.

687
00:46:40,844 --> 00:46:43,745
Oh, no. It hurts me.
That trunk had me upside-down.

688
00:46:43,847 --> 00:46:45,974
All I need now is an organ and a tin cup.

689
00:46:46,082 --> 00:46:48,209
- Come on, get me up.
- Come on, try. Get up.

690
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:50,115
- Oh, no, I...
- Come on, try!

691
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,278
No, I can't Larry.

692
00:46:51,388 --> 00:46:53,856
- All right, put your hands on the floor.
- What are you gonna do?

693
00:46:53,957 --> 00:46:55,549
- Just relax. I'll fix you.
- Oh, but don't hurt me.

694
00:46:55,659 --> 00:46:56,717
- Take a deep breath.
- All right.

695
00:46:56,826 --> 00:46:57,884
And watch it!

696
00:46:58,962 --> 00:47:01,123
There. Don't you feel better?

697
00:47:03,867 --> 00:47:05,494
Look, Myron. Myron!

698
00:47:06,636 --> 00:47:08,194
You hurt me, Larry.

699
00:47:08,305 --> 00:47:10,603
Now look what you did
to Mary's flowers.

700
00:47:16,346 --> 00:47:18,814
Hey, Myron, look at this.

701
00:47:18,949 --> 00:47:21,645
- I don't want to. I'm mad at you.
- Oh, read it.

702
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:25,051
- Hey, that girl's in trouble, huh?
- Yeah.

703
00:47:25,155 --> 00:47:27,419
She's not the only one. Read that.

704
00:47:28,525 --> 00:47:31,517
- "Polka-dot scarf killer hunted." You?
- Me.

705
00:47:31,628 --> 00:47:33,596
- Wow!
- Wow.

706
00:47:34,164 --> 00:47:38,066
"Ramon Cariso, Cuban visitor,
killed under mysterious circumstances

707
00:47:38,168 --> 00:47:40,193
"by a.38 caliber bullet."

708
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:43,166
Well, at least it wasn't one
of Shorty's men.

709
00:47:43,273 --> 00:47:46,208
Hey, this is the guy
that called up Mary in the hotel.

710
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:47,333
What?

711
00:47:47,444 --> 00:47:51,312
I heard her tell that fellow Cortega,
and he's on the boat, too.

712
00:47:51,448 --> 00:47:53,882
Now that I think of it,
when I went into her room,

713
00:47:53,984 --> 00:47:55,076
she thought I was Cariso.

714
00:47:55,218 --> 00:47:57,118
Did you use the gun
in your dressing room,

715
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,949
the one you use in your act?

716
00:47:59,055 --> 00:48:01,922
All right, Larry, don't start thinking
there were blanks in it,

717
00:48:02,025 --> 00:48:03,083
'cause there weren't.

718
00:48:03,193 --> 00:48:05,388
I put in real bullets
on the way to the hotel.

719
00:48:05,495 --> 00:48:08,123
- But you still couldn't have killed him.
- Why?

720
00:48:08,498 --> 00:48:12,434
Well, 'cause your gun is a.32 caliber,
and he was shot with a.38 caliber.

721
00:48:12,535 --> 00:48:14,765
It says so right here in the paper.

722
00:48:14,871 --> 00:48:16,361
- It does?
- Sure.

723
00:48:17,374 --> 00:48:18,636
- Then I didn't do it.
- No.

724
00:48:18,742 --> 00:48:20,300
- Somebody else did it.
- Yeah.

725
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:22,275
- We can go home.
- Right.

726
00:48:22,746 --> 00:48:26,011
Hey, if I didn't do it, who did it?

727
00:48:26,349 --> 00:48:29,944
- I don't care, Larry.
- Myron, something sure smells fishy.

728
00:48:30,353 --> 00:48:32,913
Why shouldn't it? We're on the ocean.

729
00:48:35,558 --> 00:48:37,025
We're moving!

730
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,291
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to tell the Captain

731
00:48:39,396 --> 00:48:42,092
to turn the ship around. I'm going home.

732
00:48:42,832 --> 00:48:44,129
I'm sorry.

733
00:48:46,403 --> 00:48:48,462
- What's all the excitement?
- Oh, plenty.

734
00:48:48,571 --> 00:48:51,597
Read all about it.
Man killed, but I didn't do it.

735
00:48:51,708 --> 00:48:53,107
What on earth are you talking about?

736
00:48:53,209 --> 00:48:56,303
Well, he was shot with a.38,
and I'm from the class of.32.

737
00:48:57,881 --> 00:49:00,076
- So that's Ramon Cariso.
- Yep.

738
00:49:02,052 --> 00:49:04,919
By the way,
what do you know about all this?

739
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:09,725
Hey, Corporal, I don't belong
on this boat. I want to go home.

740
00:49:09,826 --> 00:49:11,817
Well, the pilot boat will be leaving
in five minutes.

741
00:49:11,928 --> 00:49:15,022
Oh, good. We'll be right back.
I'm gonna... Tell him to wait!

742
00:49:15,865 --> 00:49:18,390
...trouble. You two make me sick.
Always sick to your stomachs.

743
00:49:18,501 --> 00:49:21,334
- But the ocean, she rocks.
- Oh, get out of the boat.

744
00:49:21,438 --> 00:49:22,928
- Oh, pardon me.
- Oh, pardon me.

745
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:24,973
- Myron!
- Miss Castinha!

746
00:49:25,075 --> 00:49:27,373
I didn't recognize you
without your fruit bowl.

747
00:49:27,477 --> 00:49:29,308
Did you remember the last time
we see each other?

748
00:49:29,412 --> 00:49:31,642
But I didn't mean to drop the tray
in the middle of your act, honest.

749
00:49:31,748 --> 00:49:33,943
It was an accident.
Besides, that was two years ago.

750
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:37,486
And you should forget about it.
Anyhow, I was very young at the time.

751
00:49:37,587 --> 00:49:39,555
I'm sorry. I apologize.

752
00:49:39,656 --> 00:49:43,148
- You don't need to apologizes.
- I don't need to apologizes?

753
00:49:43,259 --> 00:49:46,854
No, because you see,
when you dropped the tray, I got fire,

754
00:49:46,996 --> 00:49:50,397
and when I got fire, I find
a wonderful job and now I'm a big star,

755
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,900
and that's why I love you. You see?

756
00:49:53,002 --> 00:49:55,197
Oh, everybody's kissing everyone
around here.

757
00:49:55,305 --> 00:49:57,068
Well, I'm sure glad
you're not mad at me no more.

758
00:49:57,173 --> 00:49:58,697
- I'm not.
- I have to go.

759
00:49:58,808 --> 00:50:00,275
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

760
00:50:00,977 --> 00:50:02,035
That was Myron.

761
00:50:02,145 --> 00:50:03,908
- I'm sick.
- Me, too.

762
00:50:04,347 --> 00:50:05,814
And that's all I know.

763
00:50:05,949 --> 00:50:08,417
This fellow, Cariso,
warned me not to sell the castle,

764
00:50:08,518 --> 00:50:10,486
and now I find he's been killed.

765
00:50:10,587 --> 00:50:13,522
Hey, Larry, we can get off the boat
and go ashore with the pilot.

766
00:50:13,623 --> 00:50:14,647
- We can?
- Yeah.

767
00:50:14,758 --> 00:50:16,453
- Great!
- But we better hurry.

768
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,049
- Bye, Miss Carroll.
- Goodbye, Myron.

769
00:50:18,161 --> 00:50:19,992
- Come on, Larry!
- Larry,

770
00:50:20,997 --> 00:50:23,693
- thanks for everything.
- Thank you, Mary.

771
00:50:24,033 --> 00:50:25,830
- When you get back to New York...
- Come on, Larry.

772
00:50:25,935 --> 00:50:28,335
The man's waiting in the pilot boat.
We got to hurry up.

773
00:50:28,438 --> 00:50:30,702
- Come on, Larry!
- I'd like that.

774
00:50:31,307 --> 00:50:33,935
- You would?
- The man said he won't wait too long.

775
00:50:34,043 --> 00:50:36,773
Here we go. Right out there, Larry boy!

776
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,575
Come on, what do you say?

777
00:50:38,681 --> 00:50:42,344
The man... Larry!
Larry, the man's waiting.

778
00:50:42,485 --> 00:50:45,215
We'll be right down, pal!
Larry, come on, let's go!

779
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:47,312
The man's not gonna wait too long.
Come on.

780
00:50:47,424 --> 00:50:48,823
Pilot boat leaving!

781
00:50:50,226 --> 00:50:51,557
Here we go!

782
00:50:52,529 --> 00:50:53,689
Myron,

783
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:55,691
I'm not going back to New York.

784
00:50:55,865 --> 00:50:57,230
I'm going to Cuba.

785
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,127
Cuba! Are you crazy?

786
00:50:59,769 --> 00:51:03,102
Yeah, I'm crazy about Cuba.
Everybody should see Cuba.

787
00:51:03,206 --> 00:51:04,935
Now wait a minute, Larry.

788
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:06,975
I wouldn't want you to do this
on my account.

789
00:51:07,076 --> 00:51:10,307
- No, don't do it on her account.
- Oh, don't try to talk me out of it, Mary.

790
00:51:10,413 --> 00:51:12,973
Somebody around here
is playing murder and for keeps.

791
00:51:13,082 --> 00:51:15,482
You helped me out of a jam,
so I want to help you.

792
00:51:15,585 --> 00:51:16,711
Larry,

793
00:51:17,086 --> 00:51:20,988
there aren't any words to tell you
how I appreciate what you're doing.

794
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:24,025
- It's wonderful of you.
- It's dangerous, too.

795
00:51:24,861 --> 00:51:28,524
I don't know why I do these things.
Guess I'm just crazy.

796
00:51:30,533 --> 00:51:32,125
You're an angel.

797
00:51:35,438 --> 00:51:38,532
That does it. She kissed him.
He's finished.

798
00:51:38,641 --> 00:51:41,667
Now he'll do anything,
even getting himself killed.

799
00:51:41,878 --> 00:51:45,177
- Well, I'm not. I'm going. Bye-bye.
- Myron!

800
00:51:46,316 --> 00:51:49,444
Myron, I'm ashamed of you.
How can you run out at a time like this?

801
00:51:49,552 --> 00:51:51,315
- It's easy. I'll show you.
- Come here.

802
00:51:51,421 --> 00:51:53,981
Look, now Mary's in trouble,
and we're the only friends she has.

803
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:56,024
- We got to stand by her.
- You stand by her, Larry.

804
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:58,252
I'm leaving. I don't go
for none of this murder business.

805
00:51:58,361 --> 00:52:00,522
And I don't mind telling you,
I'm scared stiff.

806
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:02,894
Well, if you're scared here,
imagine what'll happen if you go back.

807
00:52:02,999 --> 00:52:06,025
- What about Shorty and his men?
- Oh, I forgot about them.

808
00:52:06,135 --> 00:52:08,467
No, Myron, it's cut and dried.
Either you play ball with me,

809
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:11,563
- or Shorty plays taps for you.
- Okay, you win.

810
00:52:12,575 --> 00:52:16,011
But I'm onto your game, Larry.
You ain't got me fooled.

811
00:52:16,112 --> 00:52:18,546
You're risking our lives for that girl.

812
00:52:18,648 --> 00:52:20,878
I know you. Just 'cause she's beautiful,

813
00:52:20,984 --> 00:52:24,249
and she has luscious lips,
a beautiful figure and she's pretty,

814
00:52:24,354 --> 00:52:26,982
and her hair is shiny and silky and...

815
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:28,523
- You know something?
- What?

816
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:30,252
I don't blame you.

817
00:52:47,744 --> 00:52:49,769
- Good evening, Miss Carroll.
- Good evening.

818
00:52:49,879 --> 00:52:53,042
I hoped you might be coming in. I have
a very nice table. Won't you join me?

819
00:52:53,149 --> 00:52:54,343
Oh, that's very nice of you, but I have...

820
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:56,179
- Thank you.
...a table.

821
00:53:17,607 --> 00:53:21,202
<i>It started in the Congo</i>

822
00:53:23,613 --> 00:53:26,980
<i>Where drums beat night and day</i>

823
00:53:29,352 --> 00:53:32,583
<i>It started in the Congo</i>

824
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:39,358
<i>Where the natives beat away</i>

825
00:53:45,902 --> 00:53:47,927
<i>The beat of the bongo</i>

826
00:53:48,037 --> 00:53:49,800
<i>The beat of the bongo</i>

827
00:53:49,906 --> 00:53:52,966
<i>For down there in the Congo</i>

828
00:53:53,076 --> 00:53:57,672
<i>The rhythm makes you sway</i>

829
00:54:04,087 --> 00:54:05,884
<i>It came to San Domingo</i>

830
00:54:05,989 --> 00:54:07,684
<i>The rhythm was so grand</i>

831
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:09,382
<i>Way down in San Domingo</i>

832
00:54:09,492 --> 00:54:11,323
<i>The rhythm swept the land</i>

833
00:54:11,427 --> 00:54:13,258
<i>The beat of the bongo</i>

834
00:54:13,363 --> 00:54:15,126
<i>And the bongo from the Congo</i>

835
00:54:15,231 --> 00:54:16,994
<i>And now from San Domingo</i>

836
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,692
<i>I bring a bongo band</i>

837
00:54:18,801 --> 00:54:20,359
<i>In San Domingo</i>

838
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:22,199
<i>They bongo bingo</i>

839
00:54:22,305 --> 00:54:24,034
<i>It's quite the thingo</i>

840
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,835
<i>In San Domingo</i>

841
00:54:25,942 --> 00:54:27,569
<i>That's where the gang go</i>

842
00:54:27,677 --> 00:54:29,941
<i>The bongo bingo</i>

843
00:54:30,046 --> 00:54:31,877
<i>When they fandango</i>

844
00:54:31,981 --> 00:54:34,040
<i>In San Domingo, ol!</i>

845
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:36,084
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce to you

846
00:54:36,185 --> 00:54:38,551
the most terrific, the most sensational...

847
00:54:40,857 --> 00:54:43,417
The biggest bongo players in history!

848
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:56,061

00:55:01,611 --> 00:55:03,203
<i>- That's where the gang go</i>

853
00:55:03,312 --> 00:55:05,246
<i>- To bongo bingo</i>
<i>- Arriba! Ol!</i>

854
00:55:05,348 --> 00:55:06,940

861
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:38,544
<i>The castanets</i>

862
00:55:38,648 --> 00:55:40,707
<i>They gaily play</i>

863
00:55:40,817 --> 00:55:42,478
<i>Castanets</i>

864
00:55:42,585 --> 00:55:44,280
<i>Make you sway</i>

865
00:55:44,387 --> 00:55:46,252
<i>- They bongo bingo</i>
<i>- Ay, ay, bongo!</i>

<i>- They bongo bingo</i>

<i>- Ay, ay, kingo!</i>

868
00:55:50,126 --> 00:55:51,718
<i>- In San Domingo</i>
<i>- Bongo bingo!</i>

869
00:55:51,828 --> 00:55:53,659
<i>If you know how to sway</i>

870
00:55:53,763 --> 00:55:55,560
<i>You can learn how to play</i>

871
00:55:55,665 --> 00:55:57,394
<i>Just the way that they play</i>

872
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,127
<i>In San Domingo</i>

873
00:55:59,235 --> 00:56:01,100
<i>If they beat when you hum</i>

874
00:56:01,204 --> 00:56:02,831
<i>Just repeat it on a drum</i>

875
00:56:02,939 --> 00:56:06,500
<i>And they'll know that you're from</i>
<i>Old San Domingo</i>

876
00:56:06,609 --> 00:56:08,338
<i>Bongo bingo</i>

877
00:56:08,444 --> 00:56:09,911
Did you say bingo?

878
00:56:10,012 --> 00:56:11,809
<i>Bingo bingo, bing-gongo ringo</i>

879

<i>Bingo bingo, bing-gongo ringo</i>

00:56:21,858 --> 00:56:23,792
<i>When you fandango</i>

884
00:56:23,893 --> 00:56:25,360
<i>In San Domingo</i>

<i>Just bingo bongo</i>

<i>And you'll be kingo</i>

00:56:31,234 --> 00:56:33,464
<i>- In San Domingo</i>
<i>- Bango</i>

889
00:56:34,137 --> 00:56:35,399
Did you say bingo?

890
00:56:35,505 --> 00:56:38,167
- Well, let's read this girl's card.
- Let's go.

891
00:56:38,808 --> 00:56:41,504
<i>A 17, a 21, a 25, you gotta that?</i>

892
00:56:41,611 --> 00:56:42,600
Yep.

893
00:56:42,712 --> 00:56:46,375
<i>- Do you got a 9, an 18, 27, 36?</i>
<i>- I gotta that</i>

894
00:56:46,482 --> 00:56:49,713
<i>- You gotta 4, gotta 9, got a 10</i>
<i>- Yup. Come again</i>

895
00:56:49,819 --> 00:56:52,788
<i>A 17, a 24, 31, 35</i>

896
00:56:52,889 --> 00:56:54,550
<i>A "B," and an "I," and a "B-l-N"</i>

897
00:56:54,657 --> 00:56:56,488
<i>A "B-l-N-G," bingo!</i>

898
00:57:03,966 --> 00:57:06,196
<i>San Domingo, bye-bye-bye</i>

899
00:57:06,335 --> 00:57:08,496
<i>Two, three, four, five, six</i>

900
00:57:09,172 --> 00:57:10,366
<i>Ol!</i>

901
00:57:23,352 --> 00:57:25,183
I really must be going now, Mr. Cortega.

902
00:57:25,288 --> 00:57:26,778
Why, of course.

903
00:57:29,392 --> 00:57:32,452
Hey, Larry, Miss Castinha thinks
we'll go great in Havana.

904
00:57:32,562 --> 00:57:34,655
And I'm going to get top billing, <i>amigo.</i>

905
00:57:34,764 --> 00:57:35,958
I think.

906
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:37,930
- Oh, get out.
- I'm sorry, Larry.

907
00:57:38,034 --> 00:57:39,399
I was just telling you about Havana.

908
00:57:50,012 --> 00:57:53,413
Why is it no one has ever invented
a cheerful foghorn?

909
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:56,814
There is a great deal of fog
on Lost Island, Miss Carroll.

910
00:57:57,153 --> 00:57:59,951
At times,
it completely shrouds the castle.

911
00:58:00,423 --> 00:58:02,357
You can't discourage me.

912
00:58:02,992 --> 00:58:04,861
- I'm going to have fun on that island.
- I'm not so sure.

913
00:58:04,861 --> 00:58:06,488
- I'm going to have fun on that island.
- I'm not so sure.

914
00:58:10,399 --> 00:58:13,197
Pardon me.
I was just dropping a few eaves.

915
00:58:13,636 --> 00:58:17,037
- Oh, Larry, I'm so glad to see you.
- Glad to see you, too.

916
00:58:17,406 --> 00:58:20,637
Well, Mr. Cortega, I've heard about you.

917
00:58:21,377 --> 00:58:23,208
Oh, have you been in Havana before?

918
00:58:23,312 --> 00:58:26,008
- No. First trip.
- A pleasure trip?

919
00:58:26,115 --> 00:58:27,514
Not exactly.

920
00:58:27,617 --> 00:58:30,245
Are you interested
in some tobacco plantation?

921
00:58:30,353 --> 00:58:33,754
Look, I'll save you a lot of time.
I'm a ghostbuster.

922
00:58:34,557 --> 00:58:35,546
A what?

923
00:58:35,658 --> 00:58:38,752
Well, you've heard of trustbusters
and broncobusters and gangbusters.

924
00:58:38,861 --> 00:58:42,058
Well, I'm a ghostbuster.
So watch it, buster.

925
00:58:42,298 --> 00:58:45,199
I hope you still feel as comical
when you come off the island.

926
00:58:45,301 --> 00:58:47,269
Good night, Miss Carroll.

927
00:58:49,405 --> 00:58:52,238
He's certainly trying to scare me away
from that castle.

928
00:58:52,341 --> 00:58:55,139
Naturally.
He wants to haunt it in private.

929
00:59:00,049 --> 00:59:04,179
Well, there's nothing like an ocean
voyage to bring people together.

930
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:07,148
Deck tennis, gypsy violins.

931
00:59:08,024 --> 00:59:10,492
Gay crowd in the cocktail lounge.

932
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:15,297
Then after dinner,
champagne, dancing, bridge,

933
00:59:15,564 --> 00:59:19,091
moonlight, moonlight nights.

934
00:59:19,201 --> 00:59:21,032
And warnings of death.

935
00:59:21,304 --> 00:59:25,570
- Oh, Larry, I am frightened.
- Don't lose your nerve now, honey.

936
00:59:27,176 --> 00:59:30,168
On the other hand,
stay as frightened as you want.

937
00:59:30,279 --> 00:59:31,576
I'm sorry.

938
00:59:34,817 --> 00:59:35,943
Larry,

939
00:59:37,053 --> 00:59:39,954
I don't know what I'd do
if you weren't here.

940
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:43,925
- You've been just wonderful.
- I have?

941
00:59:44,427 --> 00:59:47,760
I've been called a lot of things
but never wonderful.

942
00:59:49,365 --> 00:59:50,730
That's my key.

943
00:59:52,835 --> 00:59:58,432
<i>When someone wonderful</i>

944
00:59:59,642 --> 01:00:04,204

01:00:05,815 --> 01:00:12,311

946
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:18,727

947
01:00:20,396 --> 01:00:24,230
<i>it's so beautiful</i>

948
01:00:25,801 --> 01:00:29,168
<i>To hear her sigh</i>

949
01:00:29,505 --> 01:00:32,702
<i>I love you, I do</i>

01:00:36,145 --> 01:00:40,741
<i>Then suddenly you hear music</i>

951
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:45,780

Oh, Larry!

961
01:01:40,242 --> 01:01:41,209
Larry?

962
01:01:50,219 --> 01:01:51,186
Larry!

963
01:02:03,265 --> 01:02:04,232
Larry!

964
01:02:09,138 --> 01:02:10,833
Larry, I'm scared! I'm scared.

965
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,737
Come on,
someone just tried to kill Mary!

966
01:02:12,842 --> 01:02:14,070
Who? Who?

967
01:02:16,178 --> 01:02:17,770
You go that way.

968
01:02:20,049 --> 01:02:22,108
Larry! I got him, Larry!

969
01:02:22,218 --> 01:02:23,446
Larry, I got him!

970
01:02:23,552 --> 01:02:25,383
- Oh, it's you.
- Well, aren't you glad?

971
01:02:25,488 --> 01:02:26,750
- You do me a favor.
- What?

972
01:02:26,856 --> 01:02:29,120
Will you get lost for a while?

973
01:02:31,994 --> 01:02:33,052
Mary.

974
01:02:33,162 --> 01:02:36,563
- I'm right here, Larry.
- Come on. We better get below.

975
01:02:37,933 --> 01:02:39,662
Leave me alone, huh?

976
01:02:39,768 --> 01:02:42,760
With a killer running around loose, yet.

977
01:02:42,872 --> 01:02:44,931
Just 'cause you got a girl.

978
01:02:45,541 --> 01:02:47,008
Well, I don't care.

979
01:02:47,109 --> 01:02:50,135
Killer or no killer,
I can take care of myself.

980
01:02:51,313 --> 01:02:54,146
Larry, Larry.

981
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:57,913
Hey, buddy, what time does this boat

982
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,011
get to New York?

983
01:03:04,293 --> 01:03:07,353
You get a good night's sleep.
Be sure you keep that door locked.

984
01:03:07,463 --> 01:03:08,555
I will.

985
01:03:09,365 --> 01:03:10,855
Tell me, Larry.

986
01:03:11,634 --> 01:03:14,398
- Why are you so nice to me?
- Oh, I don't know.

987
01:03:14,803 --> 01:03:18,671
I guess I've always been a sucker
for girls named Mary Carroll.

988
01:03:18,941 --> 01:03:23,344
- I'll see you first thing in the morning.
- Well, I'll see you long before that.

989
01:03:23,512 --> 01:03:24,740
You will?

990
01:03:25,381 --> 01:03:28,544
You see, I'm planning to dream tonight.

991
01:03:36,926 --> 01:03:39,486
- Good night, Larry.
- Good night, Mary.

992

- What?

Well, that's what it says.

Look, there's a trick.
There's a trick to this.

See, you got to know
how to fold these things.

1006
01:04:35,784 --> 01:04:38,150
Just kind of fold naturally, see?

01:04:38,254 --> 01:04:40,051

1015

Mr. Todd, could I have a word with you
and your friend before we land?

1016
01:05:02,945 --> 01:05:04,936
- Now?
- It's very important.

- Will you excuse us, Miss Carroll?

1018
01:05:08,717 --> 01:05:10,275
- Of course.
- Thank you.

1019
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:43,618
What are you doing there?

1020
01:05:56,098 --> 01:05:57,224
Pardon me.

1021
01:05:57,333 --> 01:05:59,801
I just saw a disagreeable-looking native
listening at your door.

1022
01:05:59,902 --> 01:06:02,166
It's none of my business,
but I thought you might want to know.

1023
01:06:02,271 --> 01:06:03,738
Why, thank you.

1024
01:06:04,173 --> 01:06:06,038
- Aren't you... New Haven.
- Yes, you're...

1025
01:06:06,141 --> 01:06:07,130
The Murrays!

1026
01:06:07,242 --> 01:06:09,710
- The party after the Dartmouth game.
- That's right. Now I remember.

1027
01:06:09,812 --> 01:06:11,837
- You're Tony Warren.
- And you're Mary Carroll.

1028
01:06:11,947 --> 01:06:13,005
Right. How are you?

1029
01:06:13,115 --> 01:06:14,946
- Won't you come in?
- You look wonderful!

1030
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,381
Have you been onboard all this time?

1031
01:06:16,485 --> 01:06:18,510
No, I flew down from New York
about 10 days ago.

1032
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:22,488
I just came aboard on the official launch
to meet some friends.

1033
01:06:23,225 --> 01:06:25,785
You've lived in Havana
for quite some time now, haven't you?

1034
01:06:25,894 --> 01:06:27,657
I'm practically a native.

1035
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:30,994
Then perhaps you can tell me
what that is.

1036
01:06:33,769 --> 01:06:35,532
- Oh, hello.
- What is it?

1037
01:06:36,238 --> 01:06:38,035
- It's a voodoo <i>ouanga.</i>
- A what?

1038
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:41,576
<i>Ouanga,</i> a charm prepared
by a native voodoo priest.

1039
01:06:42,578 --> 01:06:44,978
Some of them are supposed
to bring good luck.

1040
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:47,514
But not that one.

1041
01:06:48,851 --> 01:06:49,551
No.

1042
01:06:49,551 --> 01:06:49,846
No.

1043
01:06:51,787 --> 01:06:53,721
This is a death <i>ouanga.</i>

1044
01:07:06,301 --> 01:07:08,098
I don't quite understand this, Mary.

1045
01:07:08,203 --> 01:07:10,501
Voodoo's a thing of the past
around Cuba.

1046
01:07:10,606 --> 01:07:12,130
The only place you might still find it

1047
01:07:12,241 --> 01:07:14,709
are on some of the primitive islands
further south.

1048
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:18,439
- Would Lost Island be one of them?
- What do you know about Lost Island?

1049
01:07:18,547 --> 01:07:20,105
- I own it.
- What?

1050
01:07:21,283 --> 01:07:23,308
I heard that jinx had been wished
on somebody,

1051
01:07:23,419 --> 01:07:25,580
but I didn't know it was you.

1052
01:07:27,456 --> 01:07:29,924
I'm simply doing my best
to make clear to you both

1053
01:07:30,025 --> 01:07:32,050
that Miss Carroll's
taking her life in her hands

1054
01:07:32,161 --> 01:07:33,685
if she goes into that castle tonight.

1055
01:07:33,796 --> 01:07:36,356
You know, that gives me an idea
that scares the wits out of me.

1056
01:07:36,465 --> 01:07:37,864
- What?
- Yeah, what?

1057
01:07:37,966 --> 01:07:39,058
We'll go there first.

1058
01:07:39,168 --> 01:07:40,260
- We will?
- Yeah!

1059
01:07:40,369 --> 01:07:42,963
Oh, yeah, that's right,
because there's ghosts and spooks,

1060
01:07:43,071 --> 01:07:46,097
and we always wanted
to get killed in a haunted castle.

1061
01:07:46,241 --> 01:07:47,230
Larry.

1062
01:07:47,342 --> 01:07:49,674
- You're a very brave man, Mr. Todd.
- Not at all.

1063
01:07:49,778 --> 01:07:51,746
As a matter of fact,
do you know what's liable to happen

1064
01:07:51,847 --> 01:07:53,007
if we should see a ghost tonight?

1065
01:07:53,115 --> 01:07:54,082
No.

1066
01:07:54,183 --> 01:07:57,277
We'd be so scared,
we'd probably take shots at it.

1067
01:07:57,386 --> 01:08:00,287
- Won't we feel silly shooting at ghosts?
- Yeah.

1068
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:04,623
Well, tell your friends.
We'll be seeing you.

1069
01:08:05,127 --> 01:08:06,719
Oh, yeah, we'll be seeing you.

1070
01:08:06,829 --> 01:08:08,820
Don't fly around too fast.

1071
01:08:10,299 --> 01:08:11,891
- Oh, Larry!
- Come on!

1072
01:08:13,969 --> 01:08:15,459
Do you know anybody down here?

1073
01:08:15,571 --> 01:08:18,039
No, but Larry and Myron are
on my team.

1074
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:20,438
- Who?
- Oh, excuse me.

1075
01:08:22,811 --> 01:08:24,176
Oh, come in, boys.

1076
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:26,645
Larry, Myron,
this is Tony Warren, an old friend.

1077
01:08:26,748 --> 01:08:27,772
- Hi, Tony.
- Howdy.

1078
01:08:27,883 --> 01:08:28,872
Hi.

1079
01:08:29,218 --> 01:08:31,083
He doesn't look so old.

1080
01:08:31,854 --> 01:08:33,913
- Hey, Mary, what's a zombie?
- A what?

1081
01:08:34,022 --> 01:08:37,549
- Who said anything about a zombie?
- Oh, I always thought it was a drink.

1082
01:08:37,659 --> 01:08:40,127
But that fellow Cortega,
he says it's an old dead guy

1083
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:42,697
over on the island,
and he walks like this.

1084
01:08:47,469 --> 01:08:48,595
Oh, Larry!

1085
01:08:48,704 --> 01:08:50,968
- He was telling the truth.
- He was?

1086
01:08:51,073 --> 01:08:53,303
It's voodooism, and not very pleasant.

1087
01:08:53,408 --> 01:08:55,399
You see, when a man dies
and is buried,

1088
01:08:55,511 --> 01:08:57,308
some voodoo priests
seem to have the power

1089
01:08:57,412 --> 01:08:58,640
to bring him back to life.

1090
01:08:58,747 --> 01:09:02,308
The fact is, there's an old woman living
on Lost Island who has a zombie son.

1091
01:09:02,417 --> 01:09:04,180
- Tomb-mates.
- Oh, shut up!

1092
01:09:04,553 --> 01:09:07,249
- How horrible!
- It's worse than horrible,

1093
01:09:07,623 --> 01:09:10,285
because a zombie
has no will of his own.

1094
01:09:10,392 --> 01:09:14,123
Every once in a while you see them
walking about with dead eyes,

1095
01:09:14,229 --> 01:09:16,163
blindly following orders,

1096
01:09:16,431 --> 01:09:19,093
not knowing what they do
and not caring.

1097
01:09:19,301 --> 01:09:22,634
Just like husbands.

1098
01:09:22,738 --> 01:09:25,468
Oh, we're coming! Come on, Larry.
We gotta get ready for the show tonight.

1099
01:09:25,574 --> 01:09:26,541
Okay.

1100
01:09:26,642 --> 01:09:28,906
The boys are opening at the El Caribe
tonight with Carmelita.

1101
01:09:29,011 --> 01:09:30,945
Oh, wonderful. Let me take you there.

1102
01:09:31,046 --> 01:09:32,911
And after the show is over,
we can all get together

1103
01:09:33,015 --> 01:09:34,448
and celebrate your first night in Havana.

1104
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:35,517
I'd love to.

1105
01:09:35,617 --> 01:09:37,175
Well, I was wondering
what you were going to do

1106
01:09:37,286 --> 01:09:38,378
after the show.

1107
01:09:38,487 --> 01:09:40,512
Now it's all taken care of.

1108
01:09:41,189 --> 01:09:43,054
First night in Havana.

1109
01:09:45,861 --> 01:09:48,295
No, thank you.

1110
01:10:11,653 --> 01:10:14,144
Hey, Larry, show business
really gets in your blood, don't it?

1111
01:10:14,256 --> 01:10:16,724
- First you got to have some.
- Oh, you!

1112
01:10:17,092 --> 01:10:19,959
- Hey, fellows, have you seen Carmelita?
- No. Why?

1113
01:10:20,062 --> 01:10:23,293
It is time for her to go on,
and we cannot find her!

1114
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:26,568
Hey, Larry, if she don't go on,
we don't go on.

1115
01:10:26,802 --> 01:10:29,362
Yeah, and if we don't go on,
we don't get paid.

1116
01:10:29,705 --> 01:10:33,368
- And what are we gonna do for money?
- Gee, that's bad, ain't it?

1117
01:10:33,609 --> 01:10:38,137
Well, if you can't get the original,
you gotta use a substitute.

1118
01:10:38,747 --> 01:10:40,237
Well, that makes sense.

1119
01:10:40,349 --> 01:10:43,580
If you can't get the original,
you have to use a...

1120
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,278
- Oh, Larry!
- Myron!

1121
01:10:46,388 --> 01:10:47,412
- Larry!
- Myron!

1122
01:10:47,522 --> 01:10:48,887
- Larry!
- Myron!

1123
01:10:50,258 --> 01:10:53,193
Say, why don't we all go over
to my island later?

1124
01:10:53,295 --> 01:10:54,762
- Tonight?
- Yes.

1125
01:10:55,163 --> 01:10:56,187
Sorry.

1126
01:10:56,298 --> 01:10:59,995
But only this morning my doctor
warned me against sudden shocks.

1127
01:11:00,102 --> 01:11:02,002
Besides, the boatmen won't go there
after dark.

1128
01:11:02,104 --> 01:11:03,628
I bet we'd find a way.

1129
01:11:06,241 --> 01:11:08,436
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1130
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:12,343
As you know, tonight we were to have
a wonderful show for you,

1131
01:11:12,948 --> 01:11:16,475
but I'm sorry to say
that the star of our show,

1132
01:11:17,452 --> 01:11:20,250
Miss Carmelita, is indisposed.

1133
01:13:24,813 --> 01:13:26,144
That Myron.

1134
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:32,746
This isn't in the book of etiquette,
but I'm going to do it, anyhow.

1135
01:13:37,859 --> 01:13:39,417
What's the matter?

1136
01:13:39,528 --> 01:13:40,790
That man!

1137
01:13:43,598 --> 01:13:45,930
What man? What is it?

1138
01:13:46,468 --> 01:13:47,696
I'm sorry.

1139
01:13:48,937 --> 01:13:51,303
I guess I was just seeing things.

1140
01:14:02,384 --> 01:14:06,343
<i>Enchiladas</i>

1141
01:14:06,454 --> 01:14:12,723
<i>Enchiladas</i>

1142
01:14:14,729 --> 01:14:19,792
<i>Enchiladas</i>

1143
01:14:19,901 --> 01:14:23,962
<i>Enchiladas</i>

1144
01:14:26,308 --> 01:14:32,304
<i>Enchiladas</i>

1145
01:14:33,148 --> 01:14:35,639
<i>I got, I got</i>

1146
01:14:39,955 --> 01:14:45,120
<i>All over town with a song</i>
<i>goes the enchilada man</i>

1147
01:14:45,594 --> 01:14:50,531
<i>Come gather round for the song</i>
<i>of the enchilada man</i>

1148
01:14:51,533 --> 01:14:56,561
<i>And for a treat good to eat</i>
<i>there's nothing better than</i>

1149
01:14:56,671 --> 01:15:02,337
<i>Enchiladas so nice and hot</i>

1150
01:15:02,444 --> 01:15:07,541
<i>Enchiladas I got, I got</i>

1151
01:15:11,286 --> 01:15:13,652
<i>Enchiladas</i>

1152
01:15:13,755 --> 01:15:15,552
<i>So nice and hot</i>

<i>Enchiladas</i>

1154
01:15:19,628 --> 01:15:21,220
<i>I got, I got</i>

1155
01:15:24,299 --> 01:15:28,429
<i>Say, come along, come along</i>
<i>I'm the enchilada gal</i>

1156
01:15:28,536 --> 01:15:32,472
<i>Filling the air with a song</i>
<i>I'm the enchilada gal</i>

1157
01:15:32,574 --> 01:15:35,975
<i>Come take a taste of the stuff</i>
<i>that I make like no one can</i>

1158
01:15:36,077 --> 01:15:38,773
<i>Enchiladas I got, I got</i>

1159
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:39,938
<i>How you make them?</i>

1160
01:15:40,048 --> 01:15:43,609
<i>First, you take a chili pepper</i>
<i>Add a little spice, throw a little salt in</i>

1161
01:15:43,718 --> 01:15:44,685
<i>That's nice</i>

1162
01:15:44,786 --> 01:15:46,447
<i>Little bit Tabasco, and the vinegar, too</i>

1163
01:15:46,554 --> 01:15:49,284
<i>And lots of hot mustard</i>
<i>It's good for you!</i>

1164
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:52,624
<i>Another chili pepper, stir like mad</i>

1165
01:15:52,727 --> 01:15:54,854
<i>- Take a little taste, now</i>
<i>- Not bad</i>

1166
01:15:54,963 --> 01:15:56,863
<i>Little more Tabasco, maybe a clove</i>

1167
01:15:56,965 --> 01:15:59,126
<i>- Little gasoline?</i>
<i>- Oh, that's for the stove</i>

1168
01:16:06,641 --> 01:16:09,906
<i>Enchiladas, so nice and hot</i>

1169
01:16:10,979 --> 01:16:12,537
<i>Enchiladas</i>

1170
01:16:12,647 --> 01:16:13,944
<i>I got, I got</i>

1171
01:16:17,585 --> 01:16:20,918
<i>My name is Don Ferdinand</i>
<i>I'm the enchilada king</i>

1172
01:16:21,022 --> 01:16:24,924
<i>I'll have you all understand</i>
<i>I'm really quite the thing</i>

1173
01:16:25,026 --> 01:16:28,928
<i>I make a cheese if you please</i>
<i>that is positively "ugh"</i>

1174
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:33,524
<i>And for a treat</i>
<i>try the meat that is absolutely "ugh"</i>

1175
01:16:33,635 --> 01:16:36,832
<i>After you buy it and try it</i>
<i>you'll say it's simply "ah"</i>

1176
01:16:36,972 --> 01:16:40,533
<i>Enchiladas I don't know</i>

1177
01:16:40,642 --> 01:16:43,110
<i>Enchiladas</i>

1178
01:16:43,211 --> 01:16:45,179
<i>Oh, hello</i>

1179
01:16:47,349 --> 01:16:50,944
<i>Little boy without a peso</i>

1180
01:16:51,086 --> 01:16:54,487
<i>There's no reason for your sorrow</i>

1181
01:16:54,589 --> 01:16:57,717
<i>All you have to do is say so</i>

1182
01:16:57,826 --> 01:17:01,227
<i>I will trust you till tomorrow</i>

1183
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:06,532
<i>Enchiladas so nice and hot</i>

1184
01:17:06,634 --> 01:17:09,762
<i>Enchiladas I got, I got</i>

1185
01:17:11,373 --> 01:17:13,534
<i>Pay him with your lilting laughter</i>

1186
01:17:13,641 --> 01:17:15,404
<i>It's your happiness he's after</i>

1187
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:17,944
<i>If you're happy, we are happy, too</i>

1188
01:17:18,046 --> 01:17:19,035
<i>I'm with you</i>

1189
01:17:19,147 --> 01:17:23,413
<i>All over town with a song</i>
<i>goes the enchilada man</i>

1190
01:17:23,518 --> 01:17:27,352
<i>Come gather round for the song</i>
<i>of the enchilada man</i>

1191
01:17:27,455 --> 01:17:31,186
<i>Nobody else in the world</i>
<i>ever sings the way he can</i>

1192
01:17:31,326 --> 01:17:32,918
<i>Enchiladas</i>

1193
01:17:33,028 --> 01:17:34,359
<i>So nice and hot</i>

1194
01:17:35,196 --> 01:17:37,096
<i>Enchiladas</i>

1195
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:38,563
<i>I got, I got</i>

1196
01:17:39,534 --> 01:17:41,468
<i>Enchiladas</i>

1197
01:17:41,569 --> 01:17:43,434
<i>Enchiladas</i>

1198
01:17:43,538 --> 01:17:48,407
<i>Enchiladas</i>

1199
01:17:49,377 --> 01:17:50,605
<i>We got, we got</i>

1200
01:17:57,052 --> 01:17:58,952
- Aren't they wonderful?
- They're quite a pair.

1201
01:17:59,054 --> 01:18:00,180
- Are you Mr. Warren?
- That's right.

1202
01:18:00,288 --> 01:18:01,721
- There is a call for you.
- Oh, thank you.

1203
01:18:01,823 --> 01:18:03,154
- Will you excuse me a minute?
- Of course.

1204
01:18:03,258 --> 01:18:04,657
I'll be right back.

1205
01:18:08,863 --> 01:18:09,887
Pardon, <i>seorita.</i>

1206
01:18:09,998 --> 01:18:12,865
- A note for you from the two crazy ones.
- Well, thank you.

1207
01:19:20,635 --> 01:19:22,500
"Lafayette, we are here."

1208
01:19:26,174 --> 01:19:27,732
Lafayette's here, too.

1209
01:19:27,842 --> 01:19:30,743
Oh, stop. Here, hold this.
I think it's this way.

1210
01:19:43,958 --> 01:19:45,448
Will you take it easy, Myron?

1211
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:47,721
That must be the woman
Cortega told us about.

1212
01:19:47,829 --> 01:19:50,320
She won't harm you.
She has a son of her own.

1213
01:19:50,431 --> 01:19:53,696
Oh, yeah, I forgot for a minute.
But she sure scared me.

1214
01:19:55,203 --> 01:19:56,864
- Who is her son?
- The zombie.

1215
01:19:56,971 --> 01:19:58,063
The...

1216
01:19:59,207 --> 01:20:00,231
Myron!

1217
01:20:03,378 --> 01:20:06,142
- We're going up to that castle.
- What about that woman?

1218
01:20:06,247 --> 01:20:09,273
- Oh, she's only trying to scare us.
- Well, she's doing a very good job of it!

1219
01:20:09,384 --> 01:20:10,578
Come here. Come on.

1220
01:20:33,541 --> 01:20:36,704
Hey, Larry, how long has it been
since anybody lived here?

1221
01:20:36,811 --> 01:20:38,301
Oh, about 20 years.

1222
01:20:39,113 --> 01:20:42,776
It's only been two months
since anybody's been killed here.

1223
01:20:42,884 --> 01:20:45,079
Oh, what did you go and say that for?

1224
01:20:45,253 --> 01:20:47,118
Give me the flashlight.

1225
01:20:52,794 --> 01:20:54,489
- What's that?
- Bats.

1226
01:20:55,597 --> 01:20:57,792
I wonder which one is Cortega.

1227
01:21:03,071 --> 01:21:04,197
Larry?

1228
01:21:10,845 --> 01:21:13,643
What'd we have to come here for,
Larry? Who needs ghosts?

1229
01:21:13,748 --> 01:21:14,942
<i>Needs ghosts?</i>

1230
01:21:16,684 --> 01:21:19,414
- If that's you, Cortega, you're not funny.
- You're not funny.

1231
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,509
<i>You're not funny.</i>

1232
01:21:20,622 --> 01:21:23,614
- Oh, come on, it's only echoes.
- Echoes?

1233
01:21:24,993 --> 01:21:26,551
Here. Hold this.

1234
01:21:31,065 --> 01:21:33,625
Larry, we could have got killed
a lot easier back at the club.

1235
01:21:33,735 --> 01:21:34,895
<i>- At the club.</i>
- Shut up.

1236
01:21:35,003 --> 01:21:36,903
- Oh, shut up.
<i>- Shut up.</i>

1237
01:21:41,876 --> 01:21:44,003
- You got a cold?
<i>- Got a cold?</i>

1238
01:21:54,422 --> 01:21:56,219
Now, look. You busted it.

1239
01:21:56,324 --> 01:21:57,791
Well, you scared me.

1240
01:22:10,872 --> 01:22:13,636
Hey, Myron, who does that look like?

1241
01:22:13,741 --> 01:22:15,333
Why, that's Mary!

1242
01:22:21,549 --> 01:22:23,517
That's probably
her great-great-grandmother.

1243
01:22:23,618 --> 01:22:24,676
Yeah.

1244
01:22:24,786 --> 01:22:27,050
Oh, what a dish you must have been.

1245
01:22:29,023 --> 01:22:30,991
You're not going up there,
are you, Larry?

1246
01:22:31,092 --> 01:22:34,061
Of course I am.
You can stay here if you want,

1247
01:22:35,096 --> 01:22:37,564
but if a couple of guys come
running down here in a few minutes,

1248
01:22:37,665 --> 01:22:39,064
let the first one go by.

1249
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:40,634
It'll be me.

1250
01:22:40,802 --> 01:22:43,896
Yeah, well,
if anyone passes you, that'll be me.

1251
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:18,102
They can't do that to us.
We know better.

1252
01:23:18,206 --> 01:23:19,764
Yeah. We know better.

1253
01:23:19,874 --> 01:23:22,707
You go down that way. I'll go this way.
We'll get him in between us.

1254
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:24,300
Oh, goody. Oh, wait.

1255
01:23:24,412 --> 01:23:25,436
- What?
- Bye.

1256
01:23:25,546 --> 01:23:26,513
Bye.

1257
01:23:54,909 --> 01:23:58,037
- Old man Mose is certainly dead.
- Let's go home, Larry.

1258
01:24:02,316 --> 01:24:04,648
We'll get to the bottom of this.

1259
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:13,654
I go no farther.

1260
01:24:13,761 --> 01:24:15,820
Oh, but please. We're so close.

1261
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:19,390
No, no, I don't go ashore.
I told you before.

1262
01:24:22,737 --> 01:24:24,204
Hurry, hurry.

1263
01:26:07,909 --> 01:26:09,638
There it goes again.

1264
01:26:11,846 --> 01:26:13,404
Look out, Larry!

1265
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,410
Myron!

1266
01:26:21,355 --> 01:26:24,415
Larry!

1267
01:26:26,527 --> 01:26:29,462
- Oh, why do you have to be so clumsy?
- Larry!

1268
01:26:29,564 --> 01:26:31,293
- What? What?
- Larry, a body!

1269
01:26:31,399 --> 01:26:33,026
All right, a body.

1270
01:26:35,369 --> 01:26:37,030
- "Maria."
- "Ysobel."

1271
01:26:37,138 --> 01:26:41,006
- "Carrillo."
- "1776 to 1820."

1272
01:26:41,108 --> 01:26:44,236
Hey, that's all that's left
of that beautiful girl in the portrait.

1273
01:26:44,345 --> 01:26:45,676
A mummy.

1274
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:48,578
Yeah, that's Mary's
great-great-grandmummy.

1275
01:26:49,684 --> 01:26:52,744
Oh, I shouldn't have said that
in a place like this.

1276
01:26:52,954 --> 01:26:54,819
I must have a frog in my throat.

1277
01:26:54,922 --> 01:26:57,948
It's better than having a knife
in your throat.

1278
01:27:00,394 --> 01:27:02,658
Hey, old Don Santiago himself.

1279
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:09,497
- That's the guy we saw in the hall.
- Hey, he hasn't changed a bit.

1280
01:27:09,604 --> 01:27:12,266
- He sure gets around.
- He's got a lot of spirit.

1281
01:27:12,373 --> 01:27:13,499
Oh, Myron.

1282
01:27:15,810 --> 01:27:16,777
Hey.

1283
01:27:17,745 --> 01:27:20,612
Now we know
where the ghost music came from.

1284
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:28,846
- Hey, Larry, there's the pumper.
- Go ahead, pump it.

1285
01:27:30,257 --> 01:27:32,953
- Would you like milk or cream?
- Oh, shut up.

1286
01:27:34,128 --> 01:27:36,323
There's no air coming through here.
This thing's dead.

1287
01:27:36,430 --> 01:27:37,590
It's in the right place.

1288
01:27:54,515 --> 01:27:57,643
Larry.

1289
01:28:07,995 --> 01:28:08,689
<i>Larry.</i>

1290
01:28:08,796 --> 01:28:11,424
- Yoo-hoo.
<i>- Yoo-hoo.</i>

1291
01:28:12,633 --> 01:28:15,431
- Larry, is that you?
<i>- Is that you?</i>

1292
01:28:17,638 --> 01:28:19,128
Larry, where are you?

1293
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:20,798
Did you find anything back there, Larry?

1294
01:28:20,908 --> 01:28:23,843
- No, not a thing.
- Good. Let's quit while we're ahead.

1295
01:28:23,944 --> 01:28:25,741
- Larry.
<i>- Larry.</i>

1296
01:28:25,846 --> 01:28:28,406
- That sounds like Mary's voice.
- Yeah.

1297
01:28:28,916 --> 01:28:29,940
Wait a minute, Myron.

1298
01:28:30,051 --> 01:28:32,042
That's exactly what they want us
to believe.

1299
01:28:32,153 --> 01:28:34,246
Yeah, and they can't fool us again.

1300
01:28:34,355 --> 01:28:36,016
- Can they?
- No.

1301
01:28:46,967 --> 01:28:48,628
Larry, answer me.

1302
01:28:48,736 --> 01:28:50,203
<i>Answer me.</i>

1303
01:28:59,413 --> 01:29:01,438
Larry!

1304
01:29:01,549 --> 01:29:04,211
<i>Larry!</i>

1305
01:29:20,534 --> 01:29:22,024
<i>No. Don't come up here.</i>

1306
01:29:22,136 --> 01:29:23,694
<i>Run away before it's too late.</i>

1307
01:29:23,804 --> 01:29:25,795
<i>Get out.</i>

1308
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:28,340
<i>Run away before it's too late.</i>

1309
01:29:28,442 --> 01:29:32,003
<i>Before it's too late.</i>

1310
01:29:37,985 --> 01:29:39,247
Larry!

1311
01:29:42,923 --> 01:29:44,220
<i>Larry!</i>

1312
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,860
Larry, help me!

1313
01:29:47,962 --> 01:29:49,691
<i>Help me!</i>

1314
01:30:08,582 --> 01:30:10,243
Mary, is that you?

1315
01:31:37,571 --> 01:31:40,836
Larry, we got to get out of here
before we get hurt.

1316
01:31:41,075 --> 01:31:42,906
I'm telling you,
we're not going to get hurt

1317
01:31:43,010 --> 01:31:44,944
unless we find the real secret
of this place.

1318
01:31:45,045 --> 01:31:47,013
Well, what do we keep looking for it for?

1319
01:31:47,114 --> 01:31:49,344
- Because of Mary.
- "Because of Mary."

1320
01:31:49,450 --> 01:31:50,712
Mary, Mary.

1321
01:31:51,452 --> 01:31:53,079
<i>- Gesundheit.</i>
<i>- Gesundheit.</i>

1322
01:31:53,187 --> 01:31:54,347
What did you say that for?

1323
01:31:54,455 --> 01:31:56,685
I always say <i>gesundheit</i>
when somebody sneezes.

1324
01:31:56,790 --> 01:31:59,418
Well, I didn't sneeze.
I haven't got the strength.

1325
01:31:59,526 --> 01:32:02,791
Well, if you didn't sneeze,
and I didn't sneeze...

1326
01:32:03,764 --> 01:32:06,631
Neither one of us has a cold,
so what are you worried about?

1327
01:32:06,734 --> 01:32:07,996
I'll tell you what I'm worried about.

1328
01:32:08,102 --> 01:32:10,002
The guy that sent
the death warning to Mary

1329
01:32:10,104 --> 01:32:13,505
and the volunteer fireman
that dropped a bucket on us

1330
01:32:14,541 --> 01:32:18,443
and the ghost we've been chasing
ever since we've left New York.

1331
01:32:24,251 --> 01:32:26,947
He's in this castle somewhere. Myron!

1332
01:32:27,054 --> 01:32:29,852
- Hold it!
- Get him, Larry! Larry, grab him!

1333
01:32:30,925 --> 01:32:33,894
Myron, get the can opener!

1334
01:32:42,303 --> 01:32:44,100
I got him, Larry!

1335
01:32:44,204 --> 01:32:45,762
It's the zombie!

1336
01:32:52,746 --> 01:32:54,304
Larry!

1337
01:33:45,165 --> 01:33:47,326
Myron, put him in the closet.

1338
01:34:01,949 --> 01:34:05,112
- Will you let go of him, Myron?
- Me let go of him?

1339
01:34:05,219 --> 01:34:06,413
Larry!

1340
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:10,115
Larry, the leg. The leg, Larry!

1341
01:34:10,224 --> 01:34:11,282
- The legs, Larry.
- Come on.

1342
01:34:11,392 --> 01:34:14,122
Wait. One more arm!

1343
01:34:14,228 --> 01:34:16,492
- Come on.
- One arm! Larry!

1344
01:34:20,467 --> 01:34:22,662
Larry. Oh, Larry.

1345
01:34:23,504 --> 01:34:25,768
Myron, let that zombie out again.

1346
01:34:25,873 --> 01:34:27,465
Is that really Mary?

1347
01:34:27,574 --> 01:34:29,166
It's not her great-great-grandmother.

1348
01:34:29,276 --> 01:34:31,540
Always smooching.
Let's get out of here.

1349
01:34:31,645 --> 01:34:35,081
Mary, you're the most beautiful ghost
that ever walked.

1350
01:34:37,051 --> 01:34:38,541
She was lovely, wasn't she?

1351
01:34:38,652 --> 01:34:41,951
She certainly was,
and she's improved with age.

1352
01:34:42,256 --> 01:34:45,316
Oh, kiss her again,
and let's get out of here, Larry.

1353
01:34:45,759 --> 01:34:47,693
There's nothing in reincarnation,
is there?

1354
01:34:47,795 --> 01:34:49,319
Why do you ask?

1355
01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:52,196
Because I seem to understand her.

1356
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:57,601
It's as though she were trying to tell us
how to solve the secret of this place.

1357
01:34:58,005 --> 01:34:59,666
What's down there, Larry?

1358
01:34:59,773 --> 01:35:02,264
Nothing. Just a few
of your stuffed ancestors.

1359
01:35:02,376 --> 01:35:05,038
- Take me there.
- If you insist.

1360
01:35:08,515 --> 01:35:10,449
You stay here
and keep an eye on things.

1361
01:35:10,551 --> 01:35:11,643
Stay here?

1362
01:35:11,752 --> 01:35:13,982
- You don't mind, do you?
- Oh, no.

1363
01:35:32,673 --> 01:35:34,265
Are you in there, zomb?

1364
01:35:36,510 --> 01:35:37,977
I only wanted to make sure.

1365
01:35:47,821 --> 01:35:49,652
Larry, look up there.

1366
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:52,381
What does it say?

1367
01:35:52,493 --> 01:35:54,791
"God's" something, I don't know.

1368
01:35:54,895 --> 01:35:57,523
"Treasures." The word is "treasures,"
isn't it?

1369
01:35:57,631 --> 01:36:01,761
"Treasures in abundance lie."

1370
01:36:01,869 --> 01:36:03,166
That's it.

1371
01:36:03,670 --> 01:36:05,695
Something, something...

1372
01:36:05,806 --> 01:36:07,000
"Heavenly."

1373
01:36:07,107 --> 01:36:11,066
"Heavenly key before they die."

1374
01:36:11,178 --> 01:36:12,839
There's more to this
than meets the eye.

1375
01:36:12,946 --> 01:36:15,471
You're telling me.
That's a message if I ever read one.

1376
01:36:15,582 --> 01:36:17,072
Look for a key.

1377
01:36:22,022 --> 01:36:23,455
Here are some keys.

1378
01:36:23,557 --> 01:36:26,492
- Oh, that's very funny.
- Well, a key could mean music.

1379
01:36:26,593 --> 01:36:29,061
Not on that organ. It doesn't work.

1380
01:36:31,398 --> 01:36:34,663
- I thought you said it didn't work.
- Well, it didn't.

1381
01:36:34,768 --> 01:36:37,168
Someone's fixed that since I left.

1382
01:36:37,905 --> 01:36:39,668
Mary, play some more.

1383
01:37:00,594 --> 01:37:03,427
Nobody's gonna sneak up
on little old Myron.

1384
01:37:12,706 --> 01:37:16,142
Don't look now, but old grandpappy's
having a nightmare.

1385
01:37:28,522 --> 01:37:29,853
Mr. Cortega!

1386
01:37:29,957 --> 01:37:33,449
Here, hold this. Take it easy, boy.
We'll get you out of here.

1387
01:37:33,894 --> 01:37:35,384
There's no use.

1388
01:37:36,463 --> 01:37:37,930
I've only a...

1389
01:37:38,932 --> 01:37:40,422
He stabbed me.

1390
01:37:41,435 --> 01:37:42,993
Who? Who did it?

1391
01:37:44,371 --> 01:37:46,066
I came to warn you,

1392
01:37:46,974 --> 01:37:48,464
to protect you.

1393
01:37:49,943 --> 01:37:54,209
Under the castle is a fortune.

1394
01:37:56,383 --> 01:37:58,544
- A fortune...
- What kind of fortune?

1395
01:38:00,254 --> 01:38:01,585
You'll find it.

1396
01:38:04,758 --> 01:38:05,884
Music...

1397
01:38:06,526 --> 01:38:07,823
Marching men...

1398
01:38:08,495 --> 01:38:09,484
The organ.

1399
01:38:09,596 --> 01:38:12,394
Mr. Cortega, tell us, who did this to you?

1400
01:38:12,866 --> 01:38:14,356
Marching men...

1401
01:38:16,103 --> 01:38:17,297
Music...

1402
01:38:18,605 --> 01:38:19,936
The organ.

1403
01:38:22,643 --> 01:38:24,008
Mr. Cortega.

1404
01:38:29,116 --> 01:38:31,107
All right, come on, honey.

1405
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,131
Marching men.

1406
01:38:50,737 --> 01:38:51,795
Wait.

1407
01:38:53,774 --> 01:38:55,207
Look at this.

1408
01:38:55,642 --> 01:38:57,633
I think I've got it. Here.

1409
01:39:06,887 --> 01:39:10,687
- Why, that's a bar of music.
- That's it. That's the key.

1410
01:39:10,791 --> 01:39:13,123
The marching men are keys of music.

1411
01:39:36,983 --> 01:39:39,417
Keep playing, Mary. Keep playing.

1412
01:39:45,092 --> 01:39:46,719
That's it. Higher.

1413
01:39:47,961 --> 01:39:49,690
Keep playing higher.

1414
01:39:53,266 --> 01:39:54,460
Higher.

1415
01:39:55,135 --> 01:39:56,568
Keep playing.

1416
01:39:57,037 --> 01:39:58,004
Just a little bit more.

1417
01:40:38,979 --> 01:40:40,173
Help!

1418
01:40:47,254 --> 01:40:48,949
Keep it going, Mary. Keep it going.

1419
01:40:49,055 --> 01:40:50,716
Something else is happening.

1420
01:40:50,824 --> 01:40:53,622
Help!

1421
01:40:53,727 --> 01:40:55,524
Myron, come back here.

1422
01:40:55,629 --> 01:40:56,857
Oh, Larry, it was terrible!

1423
01:40:56,963 --> 01:40:59,397
I lit a cigarette with my third hand,
and I don't have a third hand.

1424
01:40:59,499 --> 01:41:01,990
- I wanna go home! I'm scared.
- All right. Come on. Snap out of it.

1425
01:41:02,102 --> 01:41:04,070
Myron, listen.
There's a fortune under the castle.

1426
01:41:04,171 --> 01:41:05,138
It's right down there.

1427
01:41:05,238 --> 01:41:06,865
- A fortune?
- Yeah, come on. Let's go.

1428
01:41:11,978 --> 01:41:13,878
You're not going down there,
are you, Larry?

1429
01:41:13,980 --> 01:41:15,607
Certainly. Come on.

1430
01:41:15,715 --> 01:41:16,875
Oh, not me.

1431
01:41:18,618 --> 01:41:20,483
I'm gonna stay up here

1432
01:41:21,721 --> 01:41:23,279
where it's safe.

1433
01:41:38,972 --> 01:41:42,703
- Look at these old slave chains.
- Look at those old lanterns.

1434
01:41:46,413 --> 01:41:48,472
"Made in Scranton, P.A."

1435
01:41:48,582 --> 01:41:51,016
- Hmm.
- Double "hmm."

1436
01:41:54,421 --> 01:41:57,151
Hey. I wonder who lit that.

1437
01:42:17,010 --> 01:42:18,136
Larry!

1438
01:42:21,314 --> 01:42:22,406
Help!

1439
01:42:24,851 --> 01:42:25,977
Larry?

1440
01:42:29,289 --> 01:42:31,780
Oh, Mr. Cortega.
Oh, am I glad to see you.

1441
01:42:31,892 --> 01:42:35,384
Larry and Mary went downstairs here,
and they left me all alone, Mr. Cortega.

1442
01:42:35,495 --> 01:42:38,191
Mr... Gee, you're cold.

1443
01:42:43,169 --> 01:42:44,932
Help! Larry!

1444
01:42:45,038 --> 01:42:48,201
Look at these railway tracks
running through here.

1445
01:42:48,308 --> 01:42:51,573
Yeah, reminds me of my hotel room
in Steubenville.

1446
01:42:51,678 --> 01:42:53,976
It seems like some sort of mine.

1447
01:42:55,949 --> 01:42:57,211
Oh, there's a door.

1448
01:43:00,186 --> 01:43:01,517
It's stuck.

1449
01:43:02,122 --> 01:43:05,819
- Get something to pry it open with.
- There's something.

1450
01:43:08,128 --> 01:43:09,993
Here. Help me. Press on that.

1451
01:43:16,670 --> 01:43:18,297
What's the matter?

1452
01:43:36,189 --> 01:43:39,920
No, this time you are not seeing
a ghost, Miss Carroll.

1453
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:42,728
It was I at El Caribe.

1454
01:43:42,829 --> 01:43:46,629
I am Francisco Cariso.
Ramon was my twin brother.

1455
01:43:47,767 --> 01:43:50,031
I want to know why
he was murdered and by whom.

1456
01:43:50,136 --> 01:43:51,364
I've no idea.

1457
01:43:51,471 --> 01:43:53,496
He talked with you on the phone,
then he was killed.

1458
01:43:53,607 --> 01:43:55,472
- Why was he killed?
- Now, look, Cariso,

1459
01:43:55,575 --> 01:43:57,099
Miss Carroll
doesn't know anything about it.

1460
01:43:57,210 --> 01:43:58,871
- Keep out of this.
- Now hold on a minute.

1461
01:43:58,979 --> 01:44:00,606
- You can't get away with it!
- Now listen!

1462
01:44:00,714 --> 01:44:02,477
Not you. Look out!

1463
01:44:06,352 --> 01:44:07,410
Tony!

1464
01:44:07,519 --> 01:44:09,510
- All right, back away.
- Put that down.

1465
01:44:09,622 --> 01:44:12,591
Back away, all of you,
over against that wall.

1466
01:44:18,497 --> 01:44:21,261
Come on.
Put your hands behind your backs.

1467
01:44:21,467 --> 01:44:23,526
- Let the girl go.
- For what?

1468
01:44:23,836 --> 01:44:26,896
I did my best to keep her
from coming down here.

1469
01:44:27,306 --> 01:44:28,705
I even tried to buy her out,

1470
01:44:28,807 --> 01:44:31,207
but first your brother
and then Cortega crossed me.

1471
01:44:31,310 --> 01:44:33,039
What's this all about?

1472
01:44:33,145 --> 01:44:36,546
A vein of gold as wide as this island,
that's what it's about.

1473
01:44:36,649 --> 01:44:38,810
I discovered it. It's mine!

1474
01:44:38,917 --> 01:44:40,145
All mine.

1475
01:44:41,453 --> 01:44:44,581
Nobody's gonna carry any tales
away from here.

1476
01:44:46,659 --> 01:44:48,217
Close your eyes.

1477
01:44:51,230 --> 01:44:53,095
I said close your eyes.

1478
01:45:06,745 --> 01:45:09,111
Did I push the wrong note, Larry?

1479
01:45:12,851 --> 01:45:15,319
- Now move around a little.
- Oh, yeah.

1480
01:45:23,429 --> 01:45:24,919
That's the last of the film.

1481
01:45:25,030 --> 01:45:28,124
Oh, well, thank you. You won't forget
to send me a copy, will you, Francisco?

1482
01:45:28,233 --> 01:45:30,064
No, I won't forget.
Now you get Larry and Mary,

1483
01:45:30,169 --> 01:45:32,637
- and I'll get the boat ready.
- Okay.

1484
01:45:34,339 --> 01:45:36,739
We'll certainly have a lot to tell
our grandchildren.

1485
01:45:36,842 --> 01:45:38,070
Our what?

1486
01:45:38,410 --> 01:45:40,037
Our grandchildren.

1487
01:45:40,212 --> 01:45:42,180
Oh, didn't I tell you
about the next 50 years?

1488
01:45:42,281 --> 01:45:44,146
- No.
- Now you listen...

1489
01:45:44,650 --> 01:45:46,481
Hey, Lar. Hey.

1490
01:45:49,455 --> 01:45:53,255
Good morning. Good morning, children.
It's a lovely morning, children.

1491
01:45:53,358 --> 01:45:56,327
Come on, we got to get going.
The boat's waiting.

1492
01:46:14,580 --> 01:46:15,569
Larry.

1493
01:46:17,449 --> 01:46:20,350
Hey, Larry, look over there.
There's another panel.

1494
01:46:20,452 --> 01:46:21,680
I wonder what's in there.

1495
01:46:21,787 --> 01:46:23,687
Forget it, Myron.
You'll only get in trouble.

1496
01:46:23,789 --> 01:46:26,553
Oh, trouble. I'm going to take a look,
anyhow. Ha, ha, ha.

1497
01:46:31,563 --> 01:46:32,860
Larry!

1498
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:37,098
What is it, Myron? What's wrong?

1499
01:46:38,337 --> 01:46:40,498
What is this, a new language?

1500
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:46,070
Myron, there's nothing to be afraid of.
It's all been taken care of.

1501
01:46:46,378 --> 01:46:49,541
Will you take it easy?
All right, I'll look. I'll look.

1502
01:46:52,885 --> 01:46:54,648
Mary, run! Run, Mary!

1503
01:47:11,637 --> 01:47:14,333
- Mary!
- Wait for me!

1504
01:47:22,581 --> 01:47:23,946
Mary, quick!

1505
01:47:32,958 --> 01:47:34,755
Well, that's the end.
