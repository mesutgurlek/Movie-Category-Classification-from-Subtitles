1
00:00:53,189 --> 00:01:00,089
FRIENDS

2
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,419
Mom, how was your health today?

3
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,176
I alone made three goals
- Really?

4
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,929
Look I got the award for best
man of the game

5
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,724
Its very nice
- All the guys carried me here on their shoulders

6
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,104
You should have been there

7
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,648
My good son

8
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:38,570
Why are you getting out of bed?
What ever you need, I'll do it

9
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,377
What did you ask god?

10
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:58,882
What should I say?
- I say it everyday but god doesn't listen to me

11
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:04,054
What?
I say, Lord please take away our pain and sorrow.

12
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:09,852
...let me grow quickly get a good
paying job to take care of my mother

13
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:13,981
I'll get happy when you get a job?
- You won't?

14
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:15,732
Than?

15
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,485
What do I have to do to keep you happy?

16
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,612
Tell me mom

17
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,617
No matter how hard it is,
I will do it. Tell me

18
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,246
Will you do it?

19
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,206
Ofcourse, just say it

20
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:36,253
Do you know what a mother wants
from her son? - What?

21
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:47,014
Not money, wealth, or a good job.
She wants to be proud of her son...

22
00:05:48,640 --> 00:06:00,694
just like the mothers of the presidents and
the ancestors, I too want to be a mother

23
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:07,659
Would you be able to get me that respect.
Would you do those things when you get older?

24
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:14,958
Ofcourse I will. I promise to do all those
things to make you proud

25
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,465
Live long my son

26
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,056
Mom, you have a very high fever.
Please lay down

27
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,809
Okay son, you go study

28
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:40,317
I'm tired today. I will study tomorrow
- No don't skip out on studying

29
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:46,198
This is the first step to fulfilling my
am. You must study and become a respectable per

30
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,536
Okay mom, you lay down

31
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,683
Did you know how worried the doctor
was for you today?

32
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:14,476
What did he say?

33
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:18,230
He said you need full rest.
You shouldn't walk around that much

34
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:22,734
You don't get out of bed and do anything.
L will do everything when I get home

35
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,696
Okay go, its time for you school

36
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:30,868
I have made your medicine, take
it every 2 hours

37
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,997
If I come home and see that you
haven't drank your medicine than...

38
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:38,709
They are right here

39
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:42,838
Oh they are here

40
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:52,431
No letter has come from father's company

41
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,183
It's been so many days and they...

42
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,982
They will send the money

43
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,613
They know you father passed away
while working for that company...

44
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:16,496
You write them another letter and tell
them how we are living each day

45
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,459
The money we are suppose to get,
please send it quickly

46
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,671
Okay mom. Shall I go now?

47
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,779
Did they money come yet?
- Not yet Mr. Mehta

48
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:57,246
Leave my house if you cant pay the rent.
- This is not a story. In just 2 or 3 days...

49
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:06,129
By saying 2 or 3 days, its been 4 months.
i don't pay me in 2 days than I'm going to throw yo

50
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,819
Harry, did you do this question?

51
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:32,239
What are you saying?

52
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:36,493
He lost his voice while yelling at the match

53
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:37,703
Did you do the question?

54
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:40,080
No sir, I was playing in the match
- Sit down

55
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,547
You didn't either?

56
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,136
He's the one that wont the match.
Goal after goal

57
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:56,972
I know everything

58
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,350
Ral Nat, did you do the question?

59
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,518
Yes sir
- very good

60
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:08,066
See, do sports stop you from studies.
Good students are brilliant in both

61
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,694
Your heart is not into studies

62
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,697
Come show everyone how to do this question

63
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,412
Ram Nat, the principal is calling you

64
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,792
So, look...

65
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,885
Did you bring the fees?
- Sir today...

66
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,470
Today is the last day

67
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,973
If you don't give the fees today, your
name will be crossed out

68
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:41,975
In 2 or 3 days, I will get the money
from my fathers company

69
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,938
When will they come. It's been already 4
months

70
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,066
Please give me 2 more days

71
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:56,198
I have to follow the rules, tell the
committee, I cant do anything

72
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:04,957
Now I wont be able to study?

73
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:06,124
So what do you want me to do?

74
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,043
You may go now

75
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:23,725
What happened?

76
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,355
What happened, Ram Nat?

77
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:31,650
Where are you going?

78
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:40,701
L couldn't give the fees for 4 months,
so they erased my name

79
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:42,452
Your name is erased?

80
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:46,582
They erased the name of a brilliant
student like you?

81
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:53,714
Did the principal...
- He said that he has to follow the rules

82
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,851
Have faith my boy

83
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:13,483
Your name may have been erased today,
out one day your name will be on everone's tongue

84
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:18,572
God will find you a way

85
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,002
You got off very early today

86
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:33,337
Why?

87
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:39,134
Why wont you answer me?

88
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,266
What's the matter Ramu?

89
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:52,147
My name got erased because I never
gave the fees

90
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:58,362
That's why your crying. Tears in your
eyes...

91
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,781
Only cowards cry

92
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:03,867
You are my brave boy

93
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:06,912
Why are you crying?

94
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:14,962
What's going to happen if you cry.
Poverty is hard to come by in the world

95
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:22,094
You were born in a poor home, so you
should be ready to face any problem

96
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,973
You can only go ahead by going through
these problems

97
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:41,738
Just let me get better, I will work to
get you through school

98
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:48,620
Don't worry I will get you through school

99
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:54,668
Lay down mom or you will get dizzy and fall

100
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:06,013
Go check, it might be the money from the
company

101
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,698
What does it say? Tell me

102
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:35,667
We wont get the money. It says the company
is not responsible for fathers death

103
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:43,967
Not responsible? For whom he sacrificed his
life, they say they are not responsible. Crooks

104
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:51,600
I wont let this happen.

105
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:57,064
L will go plead for justice. L will...

106
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,441
You will fall mom. You will fall

107
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:17,501
Some one go call the doctor

108
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:36,557
Excuseme, sir...

109
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:37,724
What is it?

110
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:40,519
Can I get a job?
- A job?

111
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,647
What ever it is. L will do it

112
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:45,607
What can you do?

113
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:54,968
Can some one please help me cross the
road. Some one take me on the other side

114
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:02,017
I have to go to the other side.
Some one take me please

115
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,830
Are you blind? What if you died?

116
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:27,000
Yes I am blind. L can't see anything

117
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:31,129
I was asking for so ling but
no one listened

118
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:35,717
Where do you have to go?
- Over by the small store

119
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,721
Such beautiful eyes...
- Not worth anything

120
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:41,640
Come with me

121
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:11,170
What is this?

122
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:15,424
Me feet. With these I am able to walk

123
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,594
Just like you cant see, I cant walk

124
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:24,516
What is your name?
- Mohan

125
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:28,020
And yours?
- Ram Nat

126
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,360
Where do you live?
- I don't have a place

127
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:41,533
What about you?
- Right now I'm a guest on the foot path

128
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,244
You are like me too

129
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:48,457
Don't you have any one else?
- No

130
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:49,708
I am also alone

131
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:53,712
God brought us together

132
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,428
Here, the store is here

133
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:48,267
Did you eat yet?

134
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,520
Here have some

135
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:59,570
No I'm not hungry
- Think of me as your own

136
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:03,740
You starve while I eat,
that cant happen

137
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:05,659
And today you saved my life

138
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:08,620
You are my friend, right?
- Yes

139
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,874
Here, eat

140
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,713
What happened to your foot?

141
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:23,218
L got run over by a car. L just
got released from the hospital today

142
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:27,639
You were in the hospital?
- Yes, why?

143
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:35,522
Was there a nurse named Meena.
- All the nurses are called sisters

144
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:39,568
I don't know the names. Why?

145
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,363
She is my sister
- Sister?

146
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,741
Yes. That's who I am looking for

147
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:49,244
Which hospital is your sister in?
- What hospital...?

148
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,708
L don't know
ow will you find her than, there are so many hospit

149
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,836
No matter what, I still have to find her

150
00:22:58,337 --> 00:23:04,801
I'll go stand in front of every hospital.
L may not see but she will recognize me

151
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:08,972
You really have beautiful eyes

152
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:22,653
There was a time when I could see
everything. L had everything

153
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:26,782
I had a house in the village right
by the lake. It was such a peaceful life

154
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:32,704
One day darkness came and took away my sight

155
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,752
Sister, sister

156
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:41,338
Won't my eyes get better?

157
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:48,929
The doctor said he can be treated
but only from a doctor in the city

158
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:51,890
Come inside

159
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,271
I wont be able to see you any more?
- No, why do you worry

160
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:06,780
I will go and learn nursing and than
get you treated from a very good doctor

161
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:10,576
You will see again

162
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,745
Your going to the city?
- Yes, I have to go

163
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:15,497
I will take care of him till than

164
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:20,919
And she left. After a couple of days
we received a letter saying she had become a nurse

165
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:22,796
And than one night...

166
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:36,268
The weather is bad. You go to sleep.
L will come back in the morning

167
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:26,026
With all those people, I too came
to the city

168
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:30,531
And since than I have been searching
for my sister

169
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,621
Are you crying?
- I don't have sight, but I do have tears

170
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:40,707
One day we will find your sister

171
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:43,669
Come, lets go to sleep

172
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:48,423
Blind man. Please give. Long live who
gives and long live who doesn't give

173
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:56,431
Shall I open my eyes now?
- Yes open them

174
00:25:57,266 --> 00:25:58,767
Give me my share

175
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:03,313
Give me more. You kept me with you all day
- Go get out of here

176
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:05,524
Give me more or I will start screaming

177
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:31,633
Wake up. The street cleaner is here

178
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,210
What do you do during the day?

179
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:07,377
L beg

180
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:09,338
Beg?
- Yes

181
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:14,009
There is no other way. If I don't beg,
than who will feed me

182
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:18,972
You tell me, you starved all day, did
any one take care of you?

183
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:22,893
There is no use for handicapped in this
- I wont be able to do it

184
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:29,191
Than you will starve to death
- I-ll die but I wont beg

185
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:36,323
First couple of days I was the same.
But than I had to beg

186
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:40,911
That day I knew life is hard. Very hard

187
00:27:48,794 --> 00:27:49,169
Me

188
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:53,006
You play very well. Play more

189
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:07,915
Why did you stop?
- People are giving us money

190
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:13,670
Its not begging. You didn't even ask anyone
- So than what is it?

191
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:22,554
From their own will. You entertained them.
They are pleased so they are giving generously

192
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:00,903
Hey music man

193
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:07,326
Come to this window

194
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:13,707
Who is it Ramu?
- The princess of the big city

195
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:20,255
Have you heard the story of the
princess of the angels?

196
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:24,593
When she laughed, the flowers blossomed
and when she cried diamonds fell

197
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:30,516
She is just like that.
She has a very big castle...

198
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:32,976
Come come

199
00:31:35,646 --> 00:31:39,691
Wont you play some more.
L really like it

200
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:43,278
Okay I will play more

201
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:27,656
here you go
- We can't take anything from you

202
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,243
But you took from everyone else
- But we will not take from you

203
00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:35,747
Because you called us over to
listen to our music for the first time

204
00:32:36,165 --> 00:32:38,709
Also who takes anything from
their younger sister?

205
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:43,881
What are your names?
- My name is Mohan and he is Ramu

206
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:49,678
Mohan, Ramu. My name is Manjula.
Everyone calls me Manju

207
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:51,638
But we will call you princess

208
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:57,811
Why?
ys you like the princess who laughs and the flowers

209
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:01,064
Will you come back here?
- Yes ofcourse we will

210
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:05,736
Your promising your little sister, don't
- No no we wont

211
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:10,157
You guys stand here and play music
and I will come hiding

212
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:11,533
Why hiding?

213
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:16,830
Everyone forbids me to get out of bed.
Doctor says I am very sick

214
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:19,333
You will get better very soon

215
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:23,253
My brother is comming

216
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:28,342
You came down again?
Go upstairs and rest

217
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,687
Not too fast. Slowly

218
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,866
Greetings Doctor
- Greetings Ashok

219
00:33:53,283 --> 00:34:00,499
Sister Meena to take care of Manju at
night. L think she is the most qualified

220
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:11,134
Manju doesn't stop roaming around

221
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:18,058
She keeps getting out of bed. L don't
know why she came down just to meet 2 beggers

222
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:22,563
That's not right. Don't let her get
out of bed at all

223
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:25,023
Where is our Manju daughter

224
00:34:29,111 --> 00:34:32,865
Our princess seems to be upset. Why?

225
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:36,827
Why doesn't Bhai let me out of bed?
- Oh so that's the matter

226
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:40,956
Your illness gets worse from walking
around. That's why

227
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:52,593
I know you get lonely

228
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:54,928
That's why look I brought you a friend

229
00:34:57,431 --> 00:35:00,851
She will stay with you. You cant
talk to her

230
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:05,272
Now you take care of my Manju daughter

231
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:07,566
And tell her stores too

232
00:35:19,203 --> 00:35:26,210
I told you many times this is a heart
nything could happen at any time. You need to be

233
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:31,548
I am but these servents...
- Servents can't care like family

234
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:36,512
I think you should get married. Bring
Manju a sister in law

235
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:39,556
I don't want to make the wrong move

236
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:46,855
I think what if the other person that
es here doesn't give Manju the same affection I giv

237
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:50,108
But still

238
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:16,802
Why did you stop. Play

239
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:22,307
No one listens here. They come stay
for a bit and than leave

240
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:27,312
You still keep playing
- For how long? L told you no one listens here

241
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:33,110
But you make them listen. Bring them
here with the music. Let them feel your pain

242
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:22,117
Your singing?
- Don't stop. Keep playing

243
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,080
You dins very well

244
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:06,420
We got a lot of money today
- That's because you sang so good

245
00:43:07,504 --> 00:43:10,966
How could I sing without your music

246
00:43:11,717 --> 00:43:13,927
I only remembered the song by
hearing your tune

247
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:31,111
Why did you stop Ramu?

248
00:43:37,534 --> 00:43:39,244
What happened?

249
00:43:40,662 --> 00:43:45,501
L'm looking at an algebra book. L use
to use this in my class

250
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:50,672
What are you doing? Are you thinking of
stealing it? Get out of here

251
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:55,010
Why are you saying that. It's a book
from my course

252
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:56,845
Lier. Get out

253
00:43:58,305 --> 00:44:00,390
How much is it?
- Go on your way

254
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:04,311
How much is the book?
- Its 2 rupees

255
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:08,524
Give it to him Ramu. He thinks
we are crooks

256
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:31,171
They got hustled too. They paid 2
rupees for a 75 cents book

257
00:44:38,971 --> 00:44:40,931
Watch where you are going

258
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:45,978
Why don't you watch where your going.
Why you walking in the middle of the street?

259
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:52,359
Don't swear at me
ur showing me your finger. Get away from me, beg

260
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:55,279
Who are these people? What did we
do to them?

261
00:44:56,029 --> 00:44:57,447
Please don't fight

262
00:44:58,574 --> 00:45:01,201
Who's algebra book is this?
- This is mine. Give it to me

263
00:45:02,411 --> 00:45:05,080
He must have stolen it
- No I just bought this to read

264
00:45:06,165 --> 00:45:12,546
This is not for you. Go and beg
- This is ours. Give it to us

265
00:45:13,005 --> 00:45:15,424
Are you going to read too?
- Look friends even the blind can read now

266
00:45:17,926 --> 00:45:19,469
Give me the book
- Stay back

267
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,694
He stole this book
- Stole the book?

268
00:45:37,696 --> 00:45:40,199
Who's book is this?

269
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:45,871
This is mine sir
- This is yours?

270
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:48,624
What is your name?

271
00:45:51,168 --> 00:45:54,588
There is no name on it
- We just bought it right now

272
00:45:56,965 --> 00:45:58,467
Get out of here

273
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:35,045
Ramu. Where did you go

274
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:49,059
What are you doing?
- I was doing some questions

275
00:46:49,977 --> 00:46:53,021
You were doing questions all
night. What a hobby

276
00:46:54,231 --> 00:47:03,949
Its not a hobby. It's a promise.
L promised my mom I would learn

277
00:47:05,534 --> 00:47:08,412
Will you read and go to school?

278
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:13,333
L want to, but how is it possible?

279
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:20,841
How much will it cost for your studies?
- A lot

280
00:47:22,134 --> 00:47:24,428
It will cost a lot just to be enrolled

281
00:47:26,138 --> 00:47:37,316
Admission, terme tuition, texts and
books will come up atleast 50- 60 rupees

282
00:47:38,901 --> 00:47:41,862
Atleast. Who will give us that much?

283
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:50,913
L heard there are some countries where
the government pays for everyones education

284
00:47:51,872 --> 00:47:53,665
When will that happen in our country?

285
00:47:54,374 --> 00:48:00,756
Lt will happen. But by that time
we will be old

286
00:48:05,594 --> 00:48:07,971
We will get the money for sure

287
00:48:08,472 --> 00:48:10,682
From where? Who will give it to us?
- The princess

288
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:17,481
They are wealthy people. 50-60 rupees
nothing for them. The princess will give us the mom

289
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,234
She will give it but how do I ask?

290
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:23,695
Why?
- Who asks money from their younger sister?

291
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,618
That's true. But we can ask for a loan

292
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:33,205
You just get in to the school and we
will pay off the loan bit by bit

293
00:48:35,499 --> 00:48:37,668
Okay
- Than lets go there today

294
00:49:24,715 --> 00:49:27,134
Is she here?
- Yes

295
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:30,179
How are you princess?
- L'm not talking to you

296
00:49:30,846 --> 00:49:34,725
Why?
you take so long to come, I was looking out for you

297
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,519
Forgive us this time. Next we
will come quicker

298
00:49:38,312 --> 00:49:41,607
How are you feeling?
- Still the same

299
00:49:42,357 --> 00:49:44,443
How are you guys?
- Good

300
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:47,362
Talk

301
00:49:49,656 --> 00:49:52,826
You talk
- Tell her

302
00:49:54,036 --> 00:49:55,370
What's the matter?

303
00:49:55,996 --> 00:49:59,917
We have to ask you something princess
- What?

304
00:50:00,918 --> 00:50:03,253
Ramu wants to go to school
- Really

305
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,381
And for that we need money

306
00:50:06,924 --> 00:50:08,300
It could happen if you give us the money

307
00:50:08,884 --> 00:50:11,345
Hoe much do you need?
- Sixty rupees

308
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:14,139
Sixty rupees?
- We will slowly pay you back

309
00:50:14,806 --> 00:50:17,184
But I don't have that much money

310
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,821
You guys stay here, I will be right back

311
00:50:32,115 --> 00:50:36,036
Didn't I tell you to stay in bed?
- Yell at me later, first give me 60 rupees

312
00:50:36,662 --> 00:50:38,121
What will you do with it?

313
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:40,582
Ramu needs it. He wants to go to school

314
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:43,710
Yes the one who plays the music

315
00:50:44,336 --> 00:50:47,047
These are beggers
- No they aren't beggers

316
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:53,428
That day I gave them a rupee they didn't
take it. Now they need to money for school

317
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:56,390
Okay you go upstairs and I will give
it to them

318
00:50:59,268 --> 00:51:01,478
You will give them 60 rupees right?
- Yes, you go

319
00:51:03,856 --> 00:51:04,523
You guys come to the gate

320
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:24,751
Don't disturb Manju by coming here

321
00:51:25,961 --> 00:51:27,713
Don't come here again

322
00:51:31,008 --> 00:51:33,677
What are you looking at? You hustled
him, now go

323
00:51:43,145 --> 00:51:47,357
Did you get the money?
- He gave 5 rupees

324
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:51,695
Give it back to them

325
00:51:51,987 --> 00:51:55,365
Meet me when you get in to school

326
00:51:56,867 --> 00:52:00,662
We cant give it back. The princess
will be upset

327
00:52:10,756 --> 00:52:13,467
What are you doing there? Come lay down

328
00:52:15,552 --> 00:52:17,971
Why did Ramu leave crying?

329
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:20,599
Tell me why?
- I don't know

330
00:52:21,517 --> 00:52:22,893
You didn't give the money did you?

331
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:24,353
L did
- How much?

332
00:52:25,062 --> 00:52:26,063
L gave him 5 rupees

333
00:52:26,563 --> 00:52:28,315
Five rupees? That's it?

334
00:52:28,649 --> 00:52:32,736
What will happen with 5 rupees?
Why did you tell me you will give them 60 rupees?

335
00:56:47,574 --> 00:56:49,159
Come sit here

336
00:56:55,165 --> 00:56:58,293
How much did we get?
- We got 3.75

337
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:05,384
If we get this much everyday, we
can get 100 rupees in a month

338
00:57:06,301 --> 00:57:13,433
If we work harder, than we can get
even more right?

339
00:57:16,353 --> 00:57:20,190
Lt wont be long till we get your fees,
than you can go to school

340
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:28,407
And after that?
you drop me some where than take me when you I

341
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:34,663
So you work all day while I go to school?

342
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:37,040
L cant do that
- You have to go to school

343
00:57:37,749 --> 00:57:39,877
You have to fulfill your mom's dream

344
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:47,885
If you don't make something of yourself,
how will our worries go away. Who will look at us?

345
00:57:49,136 --> 00:57:51,805
There is no pain in singing.
L feel more peaceful

346
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:57,811
You will go to school right?
- Yes I will go

347
00:57:58,812 --> 00:58:02,524
You said you will take me in
front of all the hospitals...

348
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:08,489
Just leave me in front of a hospital
everyday

349
00:58:09,198 --> 00:58:15,204
When you find your sister, you will leave me

350
00:58:15,996 --> 00:58:20,626
What are you saying?
Why would I leave you?

351
00:58:22,169 --> 00:58:24,588
L will never leave you

352
00:58:25,339 --> 00:58:31,512
I cant live without you either
- How could you? God didn't bring us together part

353
00:58:34,723 --> 00:58:36,225
Here, have the medicine

354
00:58:38,977 --> 00:58:39,895
Now drink the water

355
00:58:41,939 --> 00:58:45,192
Is it gone?
No

356
00:58:48,904 --> 00:58:50,113
Is it gone now?

357
00:58:50,989 --> 00:58:53,033
What is your name?

358
00:58:54,451 --> 00:58:56,411
L don't like calling you sister

359
00:58:56,954 --> 00:58:59,540
Why? Everyone calls me sister

360
00:59:00,082 --> 00:59:01,375
But I don't like it

361
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:03,710
Are you going to call me by my name?
- No

362
00:59:04,711 --> 00:59:08,763
What if I call you didi?

363
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:10,634
Why wont you answer me?

364
00:59:11,677 --> 00:59:13,470
Don't you have a brother or a sister?

365
00:59:13,846 --> 00:59:18,600
L had a brother that called me didi

366
00:59:22,271 --> 00:59:24,314
I don't know if he is alive or not

367
00:59:26,233 --> 00:59:29,945
If he is than where is he?
- So can I call you didi?

368
00:59:34,908 --> 00:59:37,035
Go to sleep now

369
01:00:16,074 --> 01:00:19,453
Who is it? Ramu, thief

370
01:00:26,919 --> 01:00:32,883
He is the thief

371
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:37,012
Come with me

372
01:00:53,695 --> 01:01:00,285
Its dangerous to keep the
money here. You keep it

373
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:04,164
Good thing you woke up or all of
this would have been gone

374
01:01:05,249 --> 01:01:09,002
We wont stay here anymore. You find
another place tomorrow

375
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:11,380
Okay. Go to sleep

376
01:01:21,098 --> 01:01:25,185
It's a very peaceful village. A lot
wealthy people come to see it

377
01:01:26,603 --> 01:01:28,313
Come come

378
01:02:44,765 --> 01:02:47,976
There is no other place like this
in the village

379
01:02:48,435 --> 01:02:52,272
Its open from both ends. There is
a lot of wind and light

380
01:02:55,651 --> 01:03:00,656
First come in and see how comfortable
you will stay here

381
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:08,747
Your lucky this is empty.
Usually it never is

382
01:03:22,886 --> 01:03:32,146
That was Bansi. His habits are bad.
Stay away from him

383
01:03:33,814 --> 01:03:35,315
I'll get this window fixed today

384
01:03:35,732 --> 01:03:38,569
You like this place right?
- Yes

385
01:03:40,028 --> 01:03:44,533
I just want my rent on time

386
01:03:45,367 --> 01:03:49,037
We will always be on time
- That's great. Get comfortable, I will be back

387
01:03:52,875 --> 01:04:00,841
You spend all day with your friends
and forget about school

388
01:04:02,759 --> 01:04:04,803
You wont hit me will you?
- Lf you don't go to school, than I will hit you

389
01:04:13,812 --> 01:04:18,066
Are you guys new here
- Yes

390
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:23,155
Where is the luggage?
here is nothing right now, but soon we get everyth

391
01:04:26,825 --> 01:04:29,244
You didn't go to school yet.
Go to school

392
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:36,585
You have no one else? Mother, father?
- No we have no one

393
01:04:39,421 --> 01:04:50,390
I live right in front of you. Let me
know if you need anything with out hesitation.

394
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:14,915
May I come in sir?

395
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:34,852
Come

396
01:05:42,651 --> 01:05:45,487
Have a seat. What's the matter?

397
01:05:45,946 --> 01:05:49,741
L have never in the school...
- I want to study in you school

398
01:05:49,867 --> 01:05:53,328
You. In which grade?
- In 10th

399
01:05:55,873 --> 01:06:02,963
Classes have already begun.
How will you make up

400
01:06:04,882 --> 01:06:05,883
Its hard

401
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:09,845
We don't admit any student in the
middle of the term

402
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:15,767
Please do something for me.
L worked so hard to get the money

403
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,646
Can anything be done?

404
01:06:22,649 --> 01:06:27,654
L came with such hope

405
01:06:36,455 --> 01:06:37,915
Wait

406
01:06:47,799 --> 01:06:49,676
Can you write a test?
- Yes

407
01:06:50,552 --> 01:06:53,180
The result must be very good.
That's the only way

408
01:06:54,681 --> 01:06:55,641
I agree with everything

409
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:07,319
Take this boy to Mr. Sharma

410
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:35,055
Stop from entering and push
you once your in

411
01:07:37,182 --> 01:07:41,812
Get them out of here or we will
have to come see you on our knees

412
01:07:42,646 --> 01:07:45,065
It's a good thing. You will
younger again

413
01:07:47,609 --> 01:07:49,111
Look at that kids result

414
01:07:49,403 --> 01:07:57,870
English, 87. Math, 100, and
History and Geography, 87

415
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:00,747
I had to give him 274 out of 300

416
01:08:01,456 --> 01:08:02,666
I cant find any mistakes in it

417
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:07,379
That's very good
- Good? He's a gem

418
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:10,257
That's why he came to you

419
01:08:11,258 --> 01:08:13,135
Where is he?
- He's coming

420
01:08:16,555 --> 01:08:19,057
Call Pandey with the
admission forms

421
01:08:20,517 --> 01:08:21,101
You come inside

422
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:30,986
You test was excellent.
You will be admitted

423
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:32,738
Thank you very much

424
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:35,532
What is your name?
- Ram Nat Gupta

425
01:08:36,533 --> 01:08:39,661
Who is your guardian?
- I have no one

426
01:08:40,454 --> 01:08:45,918
Than its hard. We can't admit any
one with out a guardian's signature

427
01:08:46,168 --> 01:08:49,838
But sir...
- What can I do? Those are the rules

428
01:08:51,882 --> 01:08:57,429
There has to be someone responsible
for you or I cant do anything

429
01:09:00,849 --> 01:09:03,393
I will take his responsibility.
Give me the forms

430
01:09:04,812 --> 01:09:09,358
Your going to stop his education
because of one rule

431
01:09:10,818 --> 01:09:14,238
I'm his guardian from today.
hat the difference between a guardian and a teach

432
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:22,454
Here you go

433
01:09:23,831 --> 01:09:24,832
Admit him

434
01:09:25,249 --> 01:09:26,792
Come with me
- Go my son

435
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:06,123
Tell them to shut up

436
01:10:07,958 --> 01:10:09,918
Stop playing that music

437
01:10:10,711 --> 01:10:12,838
There is no noise allowed here.
There is a patient in the house

438
01:10:14,047 --> 01:10:16,133
Patient. Who, the princess?

439
01:10:16,884 --> 01:10:19,469
Who is princess.
Manju is not feeling well

440
01:10:19,845 --> 01:10:22,431
We call her princess
- What's wrong with her?

441
01:10:22,764 --> 01:10:27,436
L don't know. Since you left her
health has gotten worse

442
01:10:28,395 --> 01:10:28,937
Go away from here

443
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:35,152
We're going. Just tell the princess,
Ramu has been admitted in the school

444
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:37,779
Okay I will tell her. Go away from here

445
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:43,994
Why did you send them away?

446
01:10:44,369 --> 01:10:46,413
So what should I have done?
Put those 2 on my head?

447
01:10:47,289 --> 01:10:49,458
That I gave 5 rupees, that's
why they came back

448
01:10:50,042 --> 01:10:53,295
They don't come for your 5 rupees.
They come to meet me

449
01:10:54,004 --> 01:10:55,172
No. You will not meet them

450
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:58,717
I hate those people
who hustle young kids

451
01:11:00,427 --> 01:11:02,387
You don't know them at all

452
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:04,681
Why did you send them away? Why?

453
01:11:05,808 --> 01:11:07,601
Don't cry Manju
- Go away from here

454
01:11:07,935 --> 01:11:10,145
I don't want to hear anything

455
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:38,757
What's the matter?

456
01:11:39,299 --> 01:11:40,259
Why are you sitting here?

457
01:11:43,637 --> 01:11:44,805
Okay tell me what's the matter?

458
01:11:45,848 --> 01:11:47,307
Tell me
- I wont talk

459
01:11:48,142 --> 01:11:51,436
I cant go to school. L cant
listen to music, I cant meet anyone

460
01:11:52,187 --> 01:11:53,480
The ones I want to meet,
he makes them go away

461
01:11:54,314 --> 01:11:57,401
He calls the beggars, crooks. Why?

462
01:11:58,944 --> 01:12:02,865
Lf all of this is forbidden,
man my eating, talking and listening is also forbidde

463
01:12:03,157 --> 01:12:05,742
I wont talk to anyone
- Not even me?

464
01:12:09,788 --> 01:12:13,667
Your brother stopped you. What
did I do that you wont talk to me

465
01:12:14,293 --> 01:12:14,835
Tell me

466
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:21,717
Okay don't talk to me,
but atleast look at me

467
01:16:12,656 --> 01:16:16,451
Hey what is this handicap doing here?
- He is the book stealer

468
01:16:17,161 --> 01:16:20,539
Who let you come here?

469
01:16:20,873 --> 01:16:22,708
L've come to study

470
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,926
Save your books

471
01:16:34,428 --> 01:16:36,013
Keep going ahead

472
01:16:40,726 --> 01:16:42,728
That's my seat. Keep going

473
01:17:22,601 --> 01:17:24,394
Sit down

474
01:17:27,105 --> 01:17:28,357
Open your books

475
01:17:53,298 --> 01:17:55,217
What do they both mean?

476
01:17:57,219 --> 01:18:01,140
You tell me
- Sit down

477
01:18:02,766 --> 01:18:03,684
You tell me

478
01:18:05,978 --> 01:18:07,437
Sit down

479
01:18:13,026 --> 01:18:15,487
Doesn't anyone know?

480
01:18:17,197 --> 01:18:18,407
Tell me

481
01:18:37,009 --> 01:18:40,596
very good. Why are you
sitting there? Come here

482
01:18:59,490 --> 01:19:00,866
What happened?

483
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:05,662
Why did you get up?
- His clothes smell

484
01:19:07,623 --> 01:19:08,916
I don't know where the
beggars come from

485
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:10,000
Shut up

486
01:19:11,084 --> 01:19:12,544
Don't feel ashamed when you say that?

487
01:19:13,128 --> 01:19:15,506
Ls a man only recognized by his clothes?

488
01:19:16,131 --> 01:19:18,050
Ls that what you've learned?

489
01:19:19,092 --> 01:19:26,266
The one you don't like sitting beside,
oneday you feel privileged to sit beside him

490
01:19:30,521 --> 01:19:35,651
Will no one become friends with him

491
01:19:38,779 --> 01:19:41,365
No one will sit beside him?

492
01:19:46,286 --> 01:19:52,251
Shall I think none of you have
the right to be called peers

493
01:20:30,873 --> 01:20:31,373
What happened?

494
01:20:32,457 --> 01:20:33,750
Some one kicked form behind

495
01:20:34,626 --> 01:20:36,044
Who? Who is behind you?

496
01:20:39,756 --> 01:20:41,258
L didn't do anything

497
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:42,301
Stand on the bench

498
01:20:42,551 --> 01:20:43,635
I didn't do anything

499
01:21:10,787 --> 01:21:11,872
Do all this work for tomorrow

500
01:21:12,915 --> 01:21:14,208
Chandu, sit down

501
01:21:24,676 --> 01:21:27,012
Will you tell on me again?

502
01:21:41,652 --> 01:21:43,487
Head Master is coming

503
01:21:44,696 --> 01:21:45,739
What is happening in here?

504
01:21:46,657 --> 01:21:49,827
Look sir, this boy hit Niresh very badly

505
01:21:53,831 --> 01:21:55,749
No one hits like that

506
01:22:00,087 --> 01:22:01,255
Why did you hit him?

507
01:22:09,054 --> 01:22:11,849
Don't hit him sir. He is innocent
- He is innocent?

508
01:22:13,058 --> 01:22:16,937
Chandu started the fight. He swore
at him, pushed him and they all hit him

509
01:22:17,271 --> 01:22:19,898
They were taking his cruches
and it hit Niresh

510
01:22:20,232 --> 01:22:20,899
Why didn't you tell me this before?

511
01:22:21,191 --> 01:22:22,067
Because of Chandu's fear

512
01:22:23,193 --> 01:22:25,988
I couldn't stand to see him get beat

513
01:22:26,905 --> 01:22:31,702
Why didn't you tell me?

514
01:22:33,036 --> 01:22:36,957
What could I say sir. Its all my fault

515
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:45,174
Its my fault I'm handicapped, its my
fault I'm poor, I don't have nice clothes,

516
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:49,845
That's why you believed them too

517
01:22:51,763 --> 01:22:56,518
I am sorry. You have been through a lot

518
01:23:10,824 --> 01:23:12,409
Let him go. Please forgive him today

519
01:23:14,328 --> 01:23:21,502
Learn something from him. You don't
big by wearing nice things. You have to have a go

520
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:26,006
The one you made hit is apologizing for you

521
01:23:26,673 --> 01:23:29,968
Remember I am letting you go because of him

522
01:23:37,935 --> 01:23:39,812
Do it slowly, don't spread the dust

523
01:23:42,898 --> 01:23:44,817
You're here my son?

524
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:49,613
Ramu, what happened?
- What happened?

525
01:23:50,197 --> 01:23:54,034
His eyes are closed, his face is
black and swollen

526
01:23:54,451 --> 01:23:55,869
Looks like someone beat him up
- beat him

527
01:23:56,787 --> 01:23:58,622
Who hit you. Tell me

528
01:24:00,332 --> 01:24:01,834
I fell
- Fell?

529
01:24:02,918 --> 01:24:05,003
Are you hurt a lot?

530
01:24:07,464 --> 01:24:08,924
Your in pain. That's why you
weren't talking to me

531
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:13,762
I cant see, so your not going
to tell me anything

532
01:24:14,555 --> 01:24:17,307
Its on his back too. Come lay down my son

533
01:24:23,647 --> 01:24:26,400
Why are you sleeping? Get up

534
01:24:31,446 --> 01:24:34,366
Where is Mohan?
- He went to the bazaar with Nandu

535
01:24:34,658 --> 01:24:36,243
Bazaar, why?

536
01:24:36,952 --> 01:24:37,870
To get your medicine

537
01:24:38,537 --> 01:24:43,333
I already had medicine from the
school. Didn't any of you stop him?

538
01:24:44,042 --> 01:24:48,046
Mother told him but he said you
were hurt and you needed medicine

539
01:24:50,299 --> 01:24:53,260
Mohan loves you a lot

540
01:24:53,927 --> 01:24:56,180
Yes. He loves me a lot

541
01:24:57,097 --> 01:24:58,765
Here you go

542
01:25:42,351 --> 01:25:47,523
Hey you, you cant study here

543
01:25:48,398 --> 01:25:51,944
Why?
- We're going to play cards here

544
01:25:52,569 --> 01:25:54,822
Do you have a cigarette?
- I don't smoke

545
01:25:55,697 --> 01:25:57,825
He doesn't smoke. He drinks
milk like a baby

546
01:25:58,951 --> 01:26:01,829
Become my friend. L will
teach you everything

547
01:26:02,204 --> 01:26:03,747
I don't want to learn
- Than get out of here

548
01:26:33,443 --> 01:26:36,613
Where does Ram Nat live?
- I don't know

549
01:27:10,856 --> 01:27:13,817
He is handicapped
- He is talking about the handicap

550
01:27:14,776 --> 01:27:16,862
On this side

551
01:27:24,077 --> 01:27:25,204
Sir, you?
- Yes

552
01:27:25,662 --> 01:27:27,164
I came to see you my son

553
01:27:29,583 --> 01:27:37,382
You listen to everything the
master says. L am certain you will succeed

554
01:27:42,304 --> 01:27:44,348
The lord is with you.
You will become big

555
01:27:45,891 --> 01:27:46,683
Please come in

556
01:27:49,728 --> 01:27:51,438
Sit here
- Don't worry

557
01:27:53,398 --> 01:27:54,191
I will sit right here

558
01:27:56,151 --> 01:28:00,364
We don't have anything to spread.
We don't know how we got this house

559
01:28:01,281 --> 01:28:03,450
Its okay sit
- I'm okay sir

560
01:28:10,165 --> 01:28:11,375
So you got this house?
- Yes

561
01:28:40,904 --> 01:28:43,740
This yelling and fighting must
happened here all the time

562
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:45,576
Yes

563
01:28:46,952 --> 01:28:50,038
No this place is not worthy of you

564
01:28:52,082 --> 01:28:54,543
How can any one study in a place like this

565
01:28:55,419 --> 01:28:57,296
Leave this place

566
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:01,800
Look for a better place
- Where else can I go?

567
01:29:02,759 --> 01:29:08,515
We found this house with many
difficulties. And all the villages are the same

568
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:13,353
Every where will be the same thing
- Yes that is true

569
01:29:14,646 --> 01:29:17,191
Why don't you come to my house?

570
01:29:18,233 --> 01:29:20,652
There is enough room. You wont be bothered

571
01:29:21,236 --> 01:29:23,530
You can study there nice and quitely

572
01:29:24,323 --> 01:29:26,283
How can that be?
- Why what's wrong with that?

573
01:29:27,075 --> 01:29:30,496
L'm not alone. L have my
blind friend with me too

574
01:29:32,372 --> 01:29:33,499
I cant leave him

575
01:29:34,166 --> 01:29:37,628
But you wont be able to
study here at all

576
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:47,012
You're a bright kid who has a great
uture. It will be shame if this place gets in your way

577
01:29:50,182 --> 01:29:56,772
I know sir but I cant leave Mohan

578
01:29:57,689 --> 01:30:06,240
Okay but think about what I said.
My doors are always open for you

579
01:30:08,909 --> 01:30:10,661
Okay I will go now

580
01:30:20,462 --> 01:30:23,090
Greetings
- Live long

581
01:30:24,258 --> 01:30:26,677
Who was that?
- Ramu bhai's teacher

582
01:30:32,558 --> 01:30:35,811
You're here. What was the need
for the medicine?

583
01:30:36,395 --> 01:30:41,817
Lf you don't use the medicine,
how are you going to get better?

584
01:30:50,242 --> 01:30:53,036
Your teacher was here
- Yes

585
01:30:53,579 --> 01:30:56,748
He came to see you. It seems
like he also loves you

586
01:30:59,209 --> 01:31:03,839
I cant leave you

587
01:31:06,508 --> 01:31:08,802
Yes but why? Why all of a sudden...

588
01:31:09,636 --> 01:31:11,805
Nothing. Lets sit

589
01:31:18,312 --> 01:31:24,485
I brought your medicine but
I cant put it on with my hands

590
01:31:25,319 --> 01:31:29,698
If I had my eyes, I would
put it on properly

591
01:31:30,824 --> 01:31:35,370
You just put your hand on it.
Everything will be okay

592
01:31:58,644 --> 01:31:59,603
What happened father?

593
01:32:01,188 --> 01:32:07,069
Lts too late. Operation is the
only way. And that too is difficult

594
01:32:08,487 --> 01:32:12,741
There have been operations like
this but only in other countries

595
01:32:13,784 --> 01:32:16,745
Meaning over here...

596
01:32:16,995 --> 01:32:20,290
Okay uncle. Okay Gopal,
we will meet tomorrow

597
01:32:29,299 --> 01:32:33,137
I know my eyes will never get better

598
01:32:33,887 --> 01:32:38,642
Why wont they get better.
will take you to another country to get your operati

599
01:32:40,269 --> 01:32:44,148
Go ahead, your choice.
L have no use for eyes any more

600
01:32:44,565 --> 01:32:47,651
Why?
- Your friendship is the light in my eyes

601
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:49,903
I will see everything from your eyes

602
01:33:07,379 --> 01:33:13,051
Let him come. Ill teach him a
lesson for telling on me

603
01:33:16,513 --> 01:33:19,558
They haven't come out yet
- Where else will they go?

604
01:33:20,017 --> 01:33:24,813
Just stay ready. As soon as they come...

605
01:33:28,859 --> 01:33:31,320
He goes after people for no reason
- I don't like it either

606
01:33:31,653 --> 01:33:35,866
He will fight and everyone will help him
- Lets leave

607
01:33:39,536 --> 01:33:42,706
Where are you running?
- Why running, we have no fear

608
01:33:43,207 --> 01:33:45,834
Than?
- We don't want to feel strong by hitting some one

609
01:33:47,127 --> 01:33:50,172
Go out on bangles than scary cats

610
01:33:51,089 --> 01:33:55,636
Don't you dare
- Get out of here

611
01:33:57,304 --> 01:34:00,140
Did you swear at us?
- Yes

612
01:34:06,855 --> 01:34:09,441
I will go call someone to save you

613
01:34:11,193 --> 01:34:12,194
Go save him

614
01:34:13,362 --> 01:34:16,073
Get away

615
01:34:19,868 --> 01:34:25,666
That's enough. L'm going home

616
01:34:40,514 --> 01:34:47,813
He is sitting here again. We told you,
this is our permanent place

617
01:34:48,814 --> 01:34:51,150

Always study. Doesn't he

Why did you get him up? Why
didn't you let him study?

622

Lf he studies here, than

Is this your father's place?
- Look don't bring my father in to this

644
01:38:58,856 --> 01:39:02,609
You guys?
- Is the princess not well?

645
01:39:03,193 --> 01:39:05,237
Very bad. She's fainted

646
01:39:07,072 --> 01:39:12,244
Can we see her just once?
- No. L cant do anything

647
01:39:13,036 --> 01:39:16,582
Just leave from here. If the boss
sees, I will lose my job

648
01:39:18,584 --> 01:39:23,255
If its possible, tell the princess
that Ramu passed

649
01:39:23,797 --> 01:39:27,050
Yes I will say that. Toffy is here

Please heal the princess. You're
the most merciful. Make her feel better

651
01:40:25,943 --> 01:40:29,613
Come Ram Nat, there is good news for you

One day I needed this help. But today...
- Meaning now you want no help

655
01:40:56,640 --> 01:41:03,981
I want you to give this to
someone else other than me

656
01:41:05,816 --> 01:41:11,613
You worth praising. L am very

Who are you calling?
- My sister Meena

660
01:45:14,022 --> 01:45:16,483
Your sister?

661
01:45:16,692 --> 01:45:20,320
Sister is a nurse and the
brother is a begger

662
01:45:23,115 --> 01:45:24,283
Lets go. What are you doing here?

663
01:45:25,284 --> 01:45:26,368
He's gone mad

664
01:45:28,162 --> 01:45:33,000
He says his sister's name is Meena
and she is a nurse. Go recognize your brother

665
01:45:35,502 --> 01:45:39,131
You're my didi. L recognize your
voice. Tell me I'm your Mohan

666
01:46:05,532 --> 01:46:09,203
Did you know, he is one them
who came to hustle Manju

667
01:46:09,578 --> 01:46:10,996
It's a good thing I never
gave them 60 rupees

668
01:46:11,663 --> 01:46:14,124
What happened? Are you sick?

669
01:46:25,594 --> 01:46:27,930
Who are you calling

670

Where is she?
- She left

Where?
- Look the one that's going in the car is his didi

672
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:40,067
She is a nurse. She is leaving
with the princess's brother

673
01:46:40,734 --> 01:46:45,572
That's my didi
- if it was your didi, wouldn't she recognize you?

674
01:46:47,032 --> 01:46:48,742
Come lets go

L have to go back to the hospital

677
01:46:59,753 --> 01:47:02,464
But your done all your work.
Why do you want to go back now?

678
01:47:03,298 --> 01:47:05,509
L must go
- Tell me what's wrong

679
01:47:07,302 --> 01:47:12,099
I didn't have the strength.
People will laugh at me

680
01:47:12,808 --> 01:47:16,645
The respect that you have for
me will vanish

681
01:47:18,438 --> 01:47:25,654
I got weak and I couldn't say
that he was really my brother

682
01:47:26,530 --> 01:47:30,284
What did you do? What did you do?

683
01:47:51,805 --> 01:47:53,891
Don't worry. L will find him

684
01:47:54,766 --> 01:47:58,979
He might come and see Manju.
You will find him

685
01:48:11,658 --> 01:48:15,329
Ramu is here and he is playing music

686
01:48:16,580 --> 01:48:22,169
Look. They took so long to come

687
01:48:23,462 --> 01:48:27,341
I will go
- No one is here Manju

688
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:32,679
Bhai send them away

689
01:48:35,474 --> 01:48:42,481
They are such nice people

690
01:48:44,274 --> 01:48:45,943
they are both my friends

691
01:48:53,325 --> 01:48:58,205
No don't go. Princess, don't go

692
01:49:05,796 --> 01:49:06,713
Mohan what happened?

693
01:49:07,339 --> 01:49:09,758
Look the princess is here
- Where?

694
01:49:10,759 --> 01:49:18,725
Lt felt like she was standing right
here. She said she came too see us,

695
01:49:19,852 --> 01:49:27,651
How will she come here?

696
01:49:28,819 --> 01:49:30,737
Lets go

697
01:52:17,905 --> 01:52:20,282
Who is it?
- L'm Manju's brother

698
01:52:22,075 --> 01:52:23,994
Maybe you don't know that
Manju is no more

699
01:52:26,789 --> 01:52:28,207
She remembered you always

700
01:52:29,666 --> 01:52:32,836
Come with me to my house. Manju
has left some memories for you

701
01:52:35,005 --> 01:52:37,424
What time is it?
- It's almost 4

702
01:52:38,091 --> 01:52:41,804
At 5 Ramu will be back form school.
- There is still a long time before 5

703
01:52:42,805 --> 01:52:45,349
I will bring you back before he comes

704
01:52:55,984 --> 01:53:00,739
Are you done? Just give me 2
answers or I'll fail

705
01:53:02,616 --> 01:53:05,202
Sit down and revise it

706
01:53:06,078 --> 01:53:07,371
Here you go
- Are you done the questions?

707
01:53:17,131 --> 01:53:19,258
Where did Mohan go?

708
01:53:20,259 --> 01:53:25,389
A guy came and said he is Manju's
brother and took him with him

709
01:53:26,932 --> 01:53:27,391
Okay

710
01:53:35,774 --> 01:53:39,027
She loved this music box

711
01:53:40,696 --> 01:53:41,989
She left this for you

712
01:53:49,997 --> 01:53:52,416
Okay shall I go now?
- Sit for a while

713
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,502
Have some breakfast. Here
take some sweets

714
01:53:55,961 --> 01:53:58,338
No I will get late. Ramu will
come there and get worried

715
01:53:58,755 --> 01:54:02,968
There is still time before 5.
And if he is not there I will take you home

716
01:54:10,392 --> 01:54:12,644
Can I say something? Will you listen?
- What is it?

717
01:54:13,270 --> 01:54:15,397
Don't beg in the streets again
- Why?

718
01:54:16,106 --> 01:54:20,027
You don't know how hurt your did
was when she saw you begging

719
01:54:20,736 --> 01:54:27,075
My didi?
- When you called your didi was your Meena didi

720
01:54:28,577 --> 01:54:31,413
What are you saying?
- She cried a lot after

721
01:54:32,039 --> 01:54:36,168
At that time you couldn't bring
herself up from the humiliation

722
01:54:36,835 --> 01:54:39,713
She was ashamed seeing me beg

723
01:54:40,547 --> 01:54:47,971
I became a begger for who? L went
through hurdles, for who?

724
01:54:48,764 --> 01:54:50,641
Please forgive me bhai
- Bhai?

725
01:54:50,974 --> 01:54:55,604
No I'm a begger not your brother

726
01:54:56,647 --> 01:55:08,867
Your going to punish your did?
- Where was she when I was calling out her name

727
01:55:09,701 --> 01:55:11,370
I don't have a didi

728
01:55:11,870 --> 01:55:14,289
Please don't say that

729
01:55:15,332 --> 01:55:22,214
I mage a big mistake
- I made the mistake. L forgot I was a begger

730
01:55:23,423 --> 01:55:29,763
Forgive me. For get about that day
- How can I forget it?

731
01:55:30,681 --> 01:55:37,437
That's the problem, I cant forget.
L should've forgotten that I have a didi

732
01:55:38,147 --> 01:55:43,986
I should've forgotten the voice my
ears longed to hear

733
01:55:45,487 --> 01:55:51,118
I should've forgotten that when you
see me you would take me in your arms

734
01:55:51,410 --> 01:55:53,787
Listen to Mohan

735
01:55:54,997 --> 01:55:57,458
Your not going to forgive me

736
01:55:58,167 --> 01:56:02,838
Did you hear, I'm a begger. That's w
hy my did wont come to me

737
01:56:05,591 --> 01:56:10,053
Leave me. L'm no one's brother.
L have no sister

738
01:56:11,555 --> 01:56:14,975
Im still yours
- Yes only you

739
01:56:17,853 --> 01:56:21,815
My bhai. Just call me didi once

740
01:56:32,743 --> 01:56:35,537
He went in here

741
01:56:37,498 --> 01:56:39,291
Where is he?
- No one came here

742
01:56:39,792 --> 01:56:42,419
I saw with my own eyes.
L'll look myself

743
01:56:45,214 --> 01:56:48,592
What happened
- Thief thief

744
01:56:49,468 --> 01:56:52,888
If you keep hitting me with the
stick, how am I suppose to get out

745
01:56:53,555 --> 01:56:55,140
Okay put the stick else where

746
01:57:00,020 --> 01:57:02,356
He is the one. Ask him who else was there?

747
01:57:03,899 --> 01:57:04,608
Who else was there?
- Who else was there?

748
01:57:05,692 --> 01:57:07,778
You were four guys that ran off with my jar

749
01:57:09,947 --> 01:57:12,491
Ask him ask him
- Tell who else was there

750
01:57:12,825 --> 01:57:15,869
I don't know who else was there
- Hit him

751
01:57:17,079 --> 01:57:20,916
Was he there?
- He is blinf

752
01:57:22,709 --> 01:57:23,293
Him?

753
01:57:25,087 --> 01:57:28,006
He was there
- Lier

754
01:57:30,008 --> 01:57:34,221
You are a thief
- What are you babbling? Does he look like a thief?

755
01:57:34,930 --> 01:57:37,766
Than why did he say no one was in his house.
Grab him too

756
01:57:38,350 --> 01:57:40,644
Ramu didn't steal anything.
He doesn't know anything

757
01:57:42,104 --> 01:57:44,690
Don't worry. Why should I be
scared when I didn't even do anything

758
01:57:45,274 --> 01:57:50,028
Please inform my teacher,
Mr. Sharma. Nandu knows where he lives

759
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:51,780
Lets go
- Shut up old man

760
01:57:52,489 --> 01:57:54,533
Don't worry I will send him right away

761
01:57:55,742 --> 01:58:00,122
He's innocent. He didn't do anything
- Throw more water

762
01:58:03,876 --> 01:58:07,087
Found the 3rd one too. Take him

763
01:58:20,267 --> 01:58:21,685
Where are you?

764
01:58:22,144 --> 01:58:23,312

What are you looking at?

767
01:58:32,154 --> 01:58:34,781
Ls the police gone?
- Yes its gone. Your that scared

768
01:58:35,574 --> 01:58:40,579
I shouldn't be scared
Go inform Sharma that the police took away Ramu

769
01:58:41,371 --> 01:58:43,540
NO I'm not going. What if
they grab me too

770
01:58:43,957 --> 01:58:46,835
I'll be happy if they take you away

771
01:58:48,295 --> 01:58:49,546
Stop making excuses and go quickly

772
01:58:58,222 --> 01:59:01,099
Go into jail for at least 6 months

773
01:59:01,767 --> 01:59:06,438
Is this why you go to school? To steal?
- L'm innocent. L didn't do anything

774
01:59:07,022 --> 01:59:10,025
If you didn't do anything,
than why did he say your name?

775
01:59:10,317 --> 01:59:11,401
He is a lier

776
01:59:11,443 --> 01:59:14,905
I'm telling the truth.
L've never stole anything

777
01:59:15,906 --> 01:59:17,199
We think nothing of studying

778
01:59:18,116 --> 01:59:20,953
I is lying
- No sir he is the one that told me

779
01:59:23,038 --> 01:59:25,958
And if he tell you to burn your
house, would you do it

780
01:59:26,333 --> 01:59:26,708
Yes, I mean no

781
01:59:28,168 --> 01:59:29,419
Lock them up

782
01:59:35,968 --> 01:59:40,556
What's the matter
- Save me sir. He got me here purposely

783
01:59:41,098 --> 01:59:43,142
I didn't do anything. Please save me

784
01:59:44,434 --> 01:59:46,520
He lives in the same village right?

785
01:59:48,939 --> 01:59:53,819
L knew this was going to happen one day

786
01:59:54,695 --> 01:59:58,240
That's why I told you not to stay there.
Do you see what happened now

787
01:59:58,824 --> 02:00:01,869
There are tests happening in
school and your in jail

788
02:00:03,370 --> 02:00:07,624
Please get me out of here
- Say I get you out of here today...

789
02:00:08,167 --> 02:00:14,882
...what going to happen tomorrow?
ll have another problem. This is going to go on forg

790
02:00:16,049 --> 02:00:18,469
Please get me out sir. Get me out

791
02:00:20,137 --> 02:00:24,391
You have to listen to me
- I will listen to what ever you say

792
02:00:27,227 --> 02:00:28,520
Okay I will try

793
02:00:34,693 --> 02:00:39,198
Come partner. Please send him some juice
- Shut up

794
02:00:47,247 --> 02:00:51,293
There is a mistake happening some where

795
02:00:52,085 --> 02:00:57,466
We will find out right now.
Bring them in

796
02:00:58,717 --> 02:01:02,387
He is the best student in the school

797
02:01:03,055 --> 02:01:07,851
I know he cant do anything like this

798
02:01:08,644 --> 02:01:09,812
Come inside

799
02:01:21,532 --> 02:01:26,537
Bring the stick. It can tear off
his skin in one whip

800
02:01:27,704 --> 02:01:31,583
Tell me honestly. Was he involved?

801
02:01:43,095 --> 02:01:48,016
Was he involved?
- Yes

802
02:01:50,310 --> 02:01:52,604
He wasn't there. L was there,
and he was there

803
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:58,944
You cant take your son now

804
02:02:01,572 --> 02:02:05,993
From now on stay away from them

805
02:02:16,962 --> 02:02:21,383
Where are you going? Aren't
you coming home?

806
02:02:21,884 --> 02:02:25,262
He will never go there again

807
02:02:25,637 --> 02:02:27,598
Why?
- From now on, he will stay with me

808
02:02:44,531 --> 02:02:48,202
You came alone?
- Yes

809
02:02:49,119 --> 02:02:50,954
Didn't he get released?
- Yes he did

810
02:02:51,455 --> 02:02:52,873
Than why didn't he come with you

811
02:02:53,373 --> 02:02:55,501
He will never come back here
- Why

812
02:02:57,711 --> 02:03:01,965
Sharma took him home and said he
is going to stay there

813
02:03:02,633 --> 02:03:05,344
Stay there?
- You didn't understand him. What did Ramu say?

814
02:03:06,345 --> 02:03:09,848
He didn't say anything.
He didn't even talk to me

815
02:03:10,682 --> 02:03:34,289
Sharma said he will never go
to the village. He will stay with me

816
02:03:40,337 --> 02:03:44,341
Your feelings are right for your friend

817
02:03:46,218 --> 02:03:49,888
How can you ruin your future for them

818
02:03:52,432 --> 02:03:59,398
If you cant make your own future?
What are you going to do for him?

819
02:04:00,524 --> 02:04:06,405
For whom you love, you cant live
without. What will you do for him?

820
02:04:21,170 --> 02:04:25,799
L'm here
- He is not even answering

821
02:04:27,384 --> 02:04:30,429
He will answer

822
02:04:31,722 --> 02:04:33,682
No. Don't answer him

823
02:04:34,349 --> 02:04:36,768
If you talk once than you wont
be able to stop yourself

824
02:04:42,733 --> 02:04:49,823
Just let me see him once. Just once

825
02:05:00,334 --> 02:05:02,461
Just answer me once

826
02:05:05,547 --> 02:05:07,007
He's coming
- Coming, where?

827
02:05:07,424 --> 02:05:07,925
In the window

828
02:05:16,934 --> 02:05:21,563
Why aren't you talking

829
02:05:25,192 --> 02:05:28,195
What is my fault. Why wont you answer

830
02:05:30,697 --> 02:05:32,407
Why aren't you talking.
Tell me something

831
02:05:36,578 --> 02:05:41,542
You wont answer to my voice.
You wont come to me

832
02:05:44,044 --> 02:05:49,842
You wont talk to me

833
02:05:51,343 --> 02:05:54,638
Lets go from here

834
02:10:39,631 --> 02:10:44,470
You have come in first in the test.
But I'm not happy with your numbers

835
02:10:45,846 --> 02:10:50,642
To get on the records, you have
to get better marks. You have to study harder

836
02:10:51,310 --> 02:10:55,522
He will. He will work very hard

837
02:10:57,983 --> 02:11:02,070
You know at the test time what
problems he got into

838
02:11:03,405 --> 02:11:05,908
Now he will make up for everything

839
02:11:06,950 --> 02:11:12,748
I'm taking holidays to go to my village.
L'm thinking of taking him with me

840
02:11:13,707 --> 02:11:18,045
Over there he will study and I
will also watch him

841
02:11:19,922 --> 02:11:22,591
You cant stay without teaching

842
02:11:23,634 --> 02:11:27,763
Your taking holidays after 30 years
and our taking him with you to teach him

843
02:11:29,473 --> 02:11:31,642
How can he change his habits

844
02:11:32,768 --> 02:11:40,317
I have high hopes for you. This year
you have to make the name for the school

845
02:11:40,943 --> 02:11:42,820
I just need your blessing
- I'm proud of you

846
02:11:43,779 --> 02:11:48,784
He will have to come once to fill out forms
- He will come

847
02:11:50,160 --> 02:11:54,248
If I feel good, I will bring myself
or else he will come himself

848
02:11:55,207 --> 02:11:58,544
Greetings
- Greetings

849
02:12:27,614 --> 02:12:28,782
Give me some water
- Yes

850
02:12:34,163 --> 02:12:38,083
Your cough is getting worse.
Your fever is getting high

851
02:12:38,959 --> 02:12:43,005
I told you to sit at home.
Can't I feed you myself?

852
02:12:44,590 --> 02:12:45,841
L want to lay down
- Just lay down son

853
02:13:00,731 --> 02:13:03,108
What are you looking for?
- Nothing

854
02:13:04,526 --> 02:13:10,240
It feels like Ramu is right beside me
- Why don't you forget about him?

855
02:13:11,283 --> 02:13:17,206
Did he ever think about you?
He only thought about himself and ran away

856
02:13:17,581 --> 02:13:23,045
Don't say that. He is very
that he lost your love

857
02:13:25,047 --> 02:13:27,883
Can I say something?
- Yes go ahead

858
02:13:28,258 --> 02:13:32,805
If Ramu comes back, please forgive him
- Don't say his name infront of him

859
02:13:39,603 --> 02:13:41,063
Please take me

860
02:13:53,992 --> 02:13:56,954
Come with me. Come

861
02:14:01,416 --> 02:14:01,875
Give me some water

862
02:14:02,543 --> 02:14:04,419
Water after. First taste this

863
02:14:06,130 --> 02:14:07,714
What is it?
- Just taste it

864
02:14:09,424 --> 02:14:10,717
Churma?
- Yes

865
02:14:19,393 --> 02:14:24,606
How did you know I like this?
How did you make it?

866
02:14:25,274 --> 02:14:28,944
L didn't make it. Someone gave it
- Who gave it?

867
02:14:30,654 --> 02:14:39,413
She never said her name. It was a
etty lady who brought you some clothes, shoes and

868
02:14:40,122 --> 02:14:45,169
I want any of this. Throw it all away

869
02:14:45,961 --> 02:14:53,552
I don't want any hand outs.
L'm fine being poor

870
02:15:06,023 --> 02:15:08,817
Are you crying?

871
02:15:10,235 --> 02:15:20,037
Educators never die. T
hey are always alive

872
02:15:27,419 --> 02:15:34,301
and they are remember by upcoming
- Don't talk too much sir, your in pain

873
02:15:35,511 --> 02:15:44,019
I'm not in pain. L'm fine

874
02:15:44,937 --> 02:15:48,816
My time has come

875
02:15:49,149 --> 02:15:56,031
You read and I will listen to you
- Please lay down

876
02:15:57,324 --> 02:16:04,540
I will educate you. Where is my cane?

877
02:16:10,003 --> 02:16:11,755
What happened?

878
02:16:42,995 --> 02:16:46,999
Ram Nat has sent a letter

879
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:49,001
What does it say?

880
02:16:50,878 --> 02:16:53,255
He will not give the exams
- What?

881
02:17:01,346 --> 02:17:07,686
"Dear sir, I am writing this
letter with such sorrow...

882
02:17:08,687 --> 02:17:14,985
...you know that I though of
Mr. Sharma as a father...

883
02:17:16,153 --> 02:17:18,864
...he was the only one that helped me...

884
02:17:19,990 --> 02:17:25,329
...but now he is gone and I don't
have the money to pay for the exams...

885
02:17:26,497 --> 02:17:28,457
...that's why this year I will not
be able to sit in the exams...

886
02:17:29,625 --> 02:17:30,459
...please forgive me"

887
02:17:37,174 --> 02:17:41,512
Cant we somehow get a seat in the exam?

888
02:17:42,471 --> 02:17:45,098
How Mr. Pandey? How?

889
02:17:46,058 --> 02:17:48,811
Lf he doesn't want anyone's help,
than what can I do?

890
02:17:49,603 --> 02:17:52,731
L know him. Remember about the tuition...?

891
02:17:54,149 --> 02:17:55,234
He wont agree

892
02:18:06,328 --> 02:18:11,166
It was a dream that he would make
this school proud

893
02:18:13,127 --> 02:18:14,044
Now that cant happen

894
02:18:21,009 --> 02:18:22,010
Have some water

895
02:18:24,972 --> 02:18:26,890
You ran away from school?

896
02:18:27,266 --> 02:18:28,809
L didn't run, the day is done

897
02:18:29,143 --> 02:18:31,645
This early?
- Because Mr. Sharma passed away

898
02:18:32,187 --> 02:18:33,856
Sharma who?
- Ramu's Sharma

899
02:18:34,481 --> 02:18:35,649
Yes that's him

900
02:18:36,066 --> 02:18:38,986
So Ramu?
- I heard something about him

901
02:18:40,070 --> 02:18:40,779
What?
- He's not taking the exams

902
02:18:41,029 --> 02:18:43,782
Why?
- He doesn't have any money for the fees

903
02:18:44,992 --> 02:18:51,248
He doesn't have money so he wont
ite the exams? That cant be. He must write the exa

904
02:18:52,583 --> 02:18:55,335
Where are you going?
- I have to do something

905
02:18:55,502 --> 02:18:59,423
My Ramu doesn't write the exam and
I sit at home. No that cant be

906
02:19:00,215 --> 02:19:02,676
Your not well
- No let me go

907
02:23:20,976 --> 02:23:23,812
Greetings sir
- Greetings. What can I do for you?

908
02:23:24,605 --> 02:23:27,357
L have brought Ramu's fees

909
02:23:27,900 --> 02:23:30,319
Its his exam fee

910
02:23:31,195 --> 02:23:32,905
And you?
- L'm his friend

911
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:38,243
He doesn't want any help
o take this. He has to do his exams or everything w

912
02:23:40,496 --> 02:23:41,371
I cant take it

913
02:23:43,582 --> 02:23:47,669
Please don't say that. L went through
a lot to make this money

914
02:23:48,587 --> 02:23:53,008
Take it, but don't tell him
I gave the money

915
02:23:54,009 --> 02:23:55,427
That's even harder

916
02:23:56,178 --> 02:23:56,887
I will not take this

917
02:23:58,847 --> 02:24:02,726
Please take it. Please

918
02:24:04,895 --> 02:24:13,946
Okay I will take. Even if I have
to lie, he will write the exam

919
02:24:21,745 --> 02:24:22,204

920
02:24:26,208 --> 02:24:30,587
Sharma sent your fees with his friend

921
02:24:31,338 --> 02:24:38,887
He came late. So now we have to
urry and send these forms in. That is why I am her

922
02:24:41,265 --> 02:24:43,475
He never told me anything

923
02:24:44,518 --> 02:24:49,857
I don't know about that. If you d
on't want to sign, than dont

924
02:24:51,483 --> 02:24:56,280
But Sharma thought of you as his son

925
02:24:57,156 --> 02:25:01,410
Even while he was ill, he didn't
forget to pay your fees

926
02:25:04,913 --> 02:25:09,293
If you don't want to fulfil his
last wish. Than what can I do?

927
02:25:25,476 --> 02:25:29,771
Where are you going? Go quickly
and get Mohan

928
02:25:30,189 --> 02:25:33,066
He doesn't stay at one place.
God knows where he is

929
02:26:12,856 --> 02:26:15,859
What happened?

930
02:26:19,947 --> 02:26:22,825
He's the blind guy. He's fainted

931
02:26:23,450 --> 02:26:25,160
Can you take him to my house?
- Give me a hand

932
02:27:08,203 --> 02:27:12,207
Will he be okay?
- Don't worry he will be alright

933
02:27:13,167 --> 02:27:17,546
Can I stay here
- I'm sorry no one can stay in the general ward

934
02:27:18,255 --> 02:27:23,051
We're here to take care of him.
You go home and relax. You can come tomorrow

935
02:27:25,429 --> 02:27:27,806
What time?
- Between 4 and 6

936
02:27:28,265 --> 02:27:30,767
He's under your supervision
- Yes don't worry

937
02:27:34,480 --> 02:27:37,191
Keep calm. He will be fine

938
02:27:37,733 --> 02:27:42,196
Take care of him. This is not
the time to lose faith

939
02:27:46,617 --> 02:27:48,202
What's the matter?

940
02:27:51,038 --> 02:27:53,165
L want to attend to number 12 in you ward

941
02:27:53,457 --> 02:27:54,750
If you let me that is?

02:27:55,417 --> 02:27:59,087
You will get the permission.
Number 12...

943
02:28:00,339 --> 02:28:02,966
That blind begger?
- He's not a begger. He's my brother

944
02:28:03,884 --> 02:28:05,594
Your brother?
- Yes

945
02:28:08,680 --> 02:28:10,265
Its good if you stay with him

946
02:28:13,227 --> 02:28:17,147
But he cant know that
I'm taking care of him

947
02:28:17,689 --> 02:28:21,068
But why?
- L'll tell you all f this later

948
02:28:22,319 --> 02:28:24,029
Okay, sit. L will be right back

949
02:28:31,286 --> 02:28:33,288
You're here?

950
02:28:37,084 --> 02:28:40,879
L knew he would come

951
02:28:41,964 --> 02:28:46,844
Ramu is outside. Come in Ramu

952
02:28:55,644 --> 02:28:58,814
Water. Water

953
02:29:14,538 --> 02:29:16,457
What do you need?

954
02:29:18,041 --> 02:29:23,338
Who's soft bed is this? Who are you?

955
02:29:26,341 --> 02:29:26,675
Your in the hospital

956
02:29:28,343 --> 02:29:30,762
Don't worry. You will be well very soon

957
02:29:32,514 --> 02:29:34,558
What is it?

958
02:29:35,267 --> 02:29:36,310
Are you in a lot of pain?

959
02:29:43,609 --> 02:29:46,904
Who? Who?

960
02:29:49,072 --> 02:29:49,823
This is a sister

961
02:29:53,368 --> 02:29:56,663
Oh nurse. Ramu told me

962
02:29:57,372 --> 02:30:00,584
Do you know my didi?

963
02:30:01,877 --> 02:30:04,129
She is also a nurse

964
02:30:05,130 --> 02:30:06,131
Her name is Meena

965
02:30:07,674 --> 02:30:08,967
Do you know her?

966
02:30:15,098 --> 02:30:17,392
Maybe you only speak english

967
02:30:21,396 --> 02:30:29,071
You know it feels like this
hand is my didi's

968
02:30:30,989 --> 02:30:35,702
When I was younger and was sick,
she would rub her hand the same way

969
02:30:39,873 --> 02:30:47,047
She would sit on my bed side.
But now she wont even recognize me

970
02:30:48,215 --> 02:30:49,633
I'm a begger that's why

971
02:30:50,717 --> 02:30:56,640
If she come here. You don't
let her come near me

972
02:30:59,518 --> 02:31:02,146
Are you crying?

973
02:31:12,614 --> 02:31:15,117
She went to see anther patient

974
02:31:21,874 --> 02:31:24,293
Congratulations. You came in 1st

975
02:31:26,795 --> 02:31:27,880
I also passed

976
02:31:31,842 --> 02:31:35,304
Forgive me for everything
- Why this kind of talk today? Tell us your result

977
02:31:35,679 --> 02:31:42,227
Mine doesn't matter. L'm so
that I can tell people that Ram Nat used to study w

978
02:31:53,614 --> 02:31:58,952
Live long. Keep striving
for this kind of success through out your life

979
02:31:59,495 --> 02:32:02,623
I'm very happy today. So happy
that I ant tell you

980
02:32:03,457 --> 02:32:10,047
Your marks that made the record
has made the school very proud

981
02:32:11,298 --> 02:32:14,968
I keep remembering Sharma on this day

982
02:32:16,220 --> 02:32:20,891
His spirit must be in peace
right now with your success

983
02:32:30,150 --> 02:32:36,615
Today is a very special day.
Today I cant stop myself from telling you something

984
02:32:37,533 --> 02:32:42,746
I keep thinking of the person
who had a hand in your success

985
02:32:43,747 --> 02:32:46,542
He told me not to tell you
- I don't understand

986
02:32:47,251 --> 02:32:47,918
What are you saying?

987
02:32:48,919 --> 02:32:51,755
L'm telling you the truth.
That day I was lying to you

988
02:32:52,339 --> 02:32:55,259
And if I didn't, we wouldn't s
ee this special day

989
02:32:56,218 --> 02:33:00,430
Sharma never sent your fees
- Than who?

990
02:33:01,140 --> 02:33:02,349
One blind boy gave it

991
02:33:02,766 --> 02:33:05,978
I wasn't going to take it but he...

992
02:33:14,236 --> 02:33:15,446
Where are you going?

993
02:33:24,288 --> 02:33:27,291
Your perfectly well now.
You will go home soon

994
02:33:27,958 --> 02:33:29,042
This is all because of you

995
02:33:29,751 --> 02:33:31,211
You're the one that made me better

996
02:33:31,920 --> 02:33:36,633
If sister never took care of
me, I wouldn't be alive

997
02:33:40,095 --> 02:33:43,640
My son passed
- Your son passed?

998
02:33:44,766 --> 02:33:47,644

My friend gave the exam too.
Can I know his result?

1002
02:33:59,573 --> 02:34:01,575
Do you know the role number?
- No I don't know the number

1003
02:34:02,284 --> 02:34:03,243
Than how can you know?

1004
02:34:07,206 --> 02:34:11,126
Lt's a miracle, this year
a handicap came in 1st for the ACC exam

1005
02:34:13,295 --> 02:34:15,464
His picture is there too
- What's his name?

1006
02:34:20,969 --> 02:34:24,848
My Ramu came in 1st. This is my friend

1007
02:34:26,058 --> 02:34:28,310
Please give me the paper.
Where is his picture?

1008
02:34:46,036 --> 02:34:51,041
You don't know what he
had to face to study

1009
02:34:57,506 --> 02:35:01,677
Who's voice is that?
L recognize this voice

1010
02:35:02,594 --> 02:35:04,930

I failed

1013
02:35:27,619 --> 02:35:30,581
You're the one that passed.
Please forgive me

1014
02:35:31,582 --> 02:35:34,501
Don't talk like that. L was
never upset with you

1015
02:35:35,627 --> 02:35:40,883
I knew you would come back.
L had faith in my friendship

1016
02:35:41,550 --> 02:35:45,262
I knew our friendship would never break

1017
02:35:47,973 --> 02:35:51,977
No one can keep us apart. No one

1018
02:35:52,311 --> 02:35:55,147
I hope your enemies stay a far

1019
02:35:55,355 --> 02:35:59,818
I hope you always stay together

1020
02:36:04,490 --> 02:36:05,407
My sweets?

1021
02:36:08,994 --> 02:36:11,538
Can I say something on this
happy occasion?

1022
02:36:12,539 --> 02:36:15,834
Some one else wants to be
- Who?

1023
02:36:16,001 --> 02:36:17,795
The one who take care of you

1024
