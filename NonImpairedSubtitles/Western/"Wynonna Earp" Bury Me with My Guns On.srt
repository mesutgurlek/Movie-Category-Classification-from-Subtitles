<i>Previously in</i> Wynonna Earp...

00:00:01,447 --> 00:00:03,380
<i>Wynonna and Officer Haught.
They've been taken.</i>

3
00:00:03,416 --> 00:00:04,425
What do you mean, taken?

4
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,770
There's something very
wrong deep inside of you.

5
00:00:06,805 --> 00:00:09,329
- What was the last thing you saw?
- Waverly smiling at me

6
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:10,447
from her front porch.

7
00:00:10,472 --> 00:00:12,915
You want my help? You
two need to earn it.

8
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,135
- (grunting)
- What happened to your shoulder?

9
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,108
Revenants are human.
My boys are something more.

10
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,747
(screaming) No!!!

11
00:00:21,782 --> 00:00:23,915
- Somebody lost their head.
- Who are you?

12
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:27,653
I'm the last of the Seven. You're
just like me. You're broken.

13
00:00:29,156 --> 00:00:30,608

(Doc): The thing about an Earp, they are
survivors to the core. Quick to recover,

20
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:52,974
tenacious, committed to their cause.

21
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:57,279
Hey! Hey, stranger guy!

22
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:04,086
(Doc): The thing about this
Earp is she is all these things,

23
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:06,588
with demons for miles.

24
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:09,324
Ah!

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,859
I'm free. I'm good.

26
00:01:10,894 --> 00:01:14,663
She is also a distraction
I cannot afford right now,

27
00:01:14,698 --> 00:01:17,499

that needs to get dead.

Kyle...

29
00:01:19,703 --> 00:01:22,571
- It's Pete.
- Let me make it up to you.

30
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:32,781
(Doc): But what are friends for

31
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:35,117
if not to lend a rescuing hand
maybe once in a while?

32
00:01:35,152 --> 00:01:37,918
- Come on, just one more kiss.
- Don't!

33
00:01:37,943 --> 00:01:41,723
- Back all the way up, friend.
- This is none of your business.

34
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:45,727
She ain't anybody's but her own.

35
00:01:53,465 --> 00:01:55,103
You alright?

36
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:56,722
I'm going to be sick.

37
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,148
I thought I'd feel different.

38
00:02:06,183 --> 00:02:08,310
I thought I'd look different.

39
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:11,353
You near perished at
the hands of a maniac.

40
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:13,321
I'm not talking about that.

41
00:02:14,114 --> 00:02:16,058
The seven murderous spawns of Hell

42
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:18,827
that attacked the homestead
and killed Willa are dead.

43
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:21,943
Well, you said you'd get them,
and you got 'em.

44
00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:27,427
But this spring, coiled so tight in me?

45
00:02:27,462 --> 00:02:29,729
It's just as tight, Doc.

46
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:35,234
From my experience and I've got some

47
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,837
you release the rage,

48
00:02:38,752 --> 00:02:40,032
you might find there's nothing left.

49
00:02:42,014 --> 00:02:43,973
Worst fortune-cookie advice ever.

50
00:02:44,993 --> 00:02:46,585
I hate this stupid curse.

51
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:50,850
What did Wyatt do
to mess us all up so bad?

52
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,180
He always aimed to be a good
man. It might be it didn't take.

53
00:02:55,618 --> 00:02:57,015
In the end, it's men like me

54
00:02:57,615 --> 00:02:59,418
often survive.

55
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,127
Then maybe it's better to be bad.

56

(grunting) Shiiiit.

57
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:14,833
- I'm bored outta my tits.
- Why in hell we need 20 of us

58
00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:16,214
to guard them witch's bones?

59
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,236
Yeah, what's she gonna do?
Cast a scaredy spell?

60
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:20,405
- (laughing)
- Or a love potion.

61
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:23,075
Hey, maybe she got a magic wand

62
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,944

Oh, I've got a wand.

make you shit your pants.

92

What.

93
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:04,592
- A brain peeler?
- Psychological assessment.

94
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:07,356
I was "assessed" plenty
when I was a crazy teenager

95

Yeah, well, Head Office insists on it.

- You tell them.

There's an Analyst waiting

Are you having trouble sleeping?

100
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:26,442

What? Kidding. No. No trouble.

102
00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:33,382
Do you have an exaggerated
startle response?

103
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:35,136
Only to shirtless men with man-boobs.

Stay on course, Earp.

105
00:05:36,653 --> 00:05:39,088
Have you ever mistaken
a human for a demon?

106
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:42,158
- Never.
- Do you have disturbing

107
00:05:42,193 --> 00:05:44,260
and repeated thoughts or flashbacks

108
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:46,495
of your abduction
and near-death experience?

109
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:48,255
Nope.

110
00:05:49,104 --> 00:05:51,834
Do you have disturbing and
repeated thoughts or flashbacks

111
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:54,170
of killing supernatural creatures?

112
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:57,506
- No.
- Do you have disturbing

113
00:05:57,542 --> 00:06:00,109
and repeated thoughts or
flashbacks of killing your father?

114
00:06:00,814 --> 00:06:02,545
Why's she going off book?

115
00:06:02,854 --> 00:06:04,377
Sometimes. I guess.

116
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,418
When was the last time
you had sexual intercourse?

117
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:12,205
I don't know what that has to
do with anything.

118
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,157
The bomb in the Bleaker Case was traced
back to a young woman

119
00:06:15,193 --> 00:06:17,026
who ran briefly with the Banditos.

120
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:20,397
You ran with the Banditos.

121
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:24,133
- Two people died.
- Is there a question in there?

122
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:27,036
Would you consider yourself a murderer,

123
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,051
Wynonna?

124
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:32,141
(Wynonna): <i>All you did was watch.</i>

125
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:34,510
I couldn't burst in. It would've
made you look even worse.

126
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:36,304
You're supposed to be
my goddamned friend.

127
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,613
Yeah, I'm your boss.

128
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:40,583
- You know what I mean.
- We need to be careful, alright?

129
00:06:40,618 --> 00:06:42,985
You're not even a real
deputy, Earp, come on.

130
00:06:43,021 --> 00:06:45,154
No. I'm just the one
with the big-ass gun

131
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:47,710
who sends the fiends of Hell to
their deaths.

132
00:06:47,735 --> 00:06:50,126
Technically, it's not the gun
that kills them, it's...

133
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:51,584
Oh my God!

134
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,664
You stupid government lackey,

135
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,532
you left me in there

136
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:58,834
with a bureaucratic sadist
and I was alone and scared.

137
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,270
- You're not alone, Earp.
- Or a murderer.

138
00:07:01,306 --> 00:07:02,577
OK.

139
00:07:03,374 --> 00:07:05,367
Just once, I want you to say it.

140
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:07,695
That you care about me.

141
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,786
Pussy.

142
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,639
(sighing) Earp.

143
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,271
You failed the assessment.

144
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:24,488
You're suspended until further notice.

145
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:29,013
Badge.

146
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:33,336
Perfect.

147
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:35,805
Have fun with your girlfriend.

148
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,763
It's quite generous,

149
00:07:40,798 --> 00:07:42,748
considering the condition
of the building.

150
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:46,676
I'm seeing some fine print here.

151
00:07:47,318 --> 00:07:50,008
- The usual, Waves.
- Pete...

152
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:51,980
The usual, please.

153
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:55,624
That states the buyer's intentions,
which could include anything

154
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,399
- from rebuilding or remodeling...
- They want to tear it down?

155
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:01,218
There you go.

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,642
I heard about you and Champ, by the way.

157
00:08:06,037 --> 00:08:09,789
He never treated you right,
Waverly. I was thinking,

158
00:08:09,841 --> 00:08:12,908
you know, any man in Purgatory
would be lucky to have you.

159
00:08:12,944 --> 00:08:16,112
- And I was also thinking...
- That you should find a gal

160
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:18,848
like me, only taller, right?
So she can actually get up

161
00:08:18,883 --> 00:08:21,617
in that custom-lifted tricked-out pickup

162
00:08:21,652 --> 00:08:22,697
- of yours?
- Yeah,

163
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:25,175
- exactly.
- Move.

164
00:08:25,316 --> 00:08:27,516
Ooh! Someone woke up on
the wrong side of the bed.

165
00:08:27,552 --> 00:08:29,318
Why do I even get out of bed?

166
00:08:29,353 --> 00:08:31,828
A bed that I have every right
to screw whoever I want in.

167
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:33,622
Don't even.

168
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:35,991
"Have fun with your girlfriend?"

169
00:08:36,027 --> 00:08:38,173
What kind of stupid exit line was that?

170
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,429
Move!

171
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:45,201
Who's that?

172
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,570
Gus is getting an offer to buy the bar.

173
00:08:48,323 --> 00:08:49,638
I know!

174
00:08:49,674 --> 00:08:52,842
She can't do that, can she, Wyn? I mean,
she wouldn't, right, she couldn't...

175
00:08:52,877 --> 00:08:54,038
She won't.

176
00:08:57,215 --> 00:09:00,883
If that asshat's a real estate broker,
then I'm an oil baron's labradoodle.

177
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:05,421
No one's taking the bar. No one is ever

178
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:07,702
taking anything from us again.

179
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:18,518
Turn around, shit brick.

180
00:09:19,564 --> 00:09:22,171
Please, don't. I can give you money.

181
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:24,440
You want to get to me?
You don't go through my family.

182
00:09:25,026 --> 00:09:26,409
I don't even know you.

183
00:09:26,444 --> 00:09:29,445
It doesn't matter how many of you

184
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,615
come after me. I will put you down

185
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,885
whether you make your peace or not.

186
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,154
(gun cocking)

187
00:09:38,189 --> 00:09:40,122
Show me your brand.

188
00:09:40,158 --> 00:09:43,125
(liquid trickling)

189
00:09:46,998 --> 00:09:49,431
Sorry, I thought you were
something... someone else.

190
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,172
You're crazy.

191
00:09:59,343 --> 00:10:02,011
That's all the bones we have, boys.

192
00:10:02,046 --> 00:10:03,979
And I'm afraid the one
with the head wins.

193
00:10:04,015 --> 00:10:05,929
I'm sorry, my love.

194
00:10:06,918 --> 00:10:09,818
You will live in your brother.
One is better than none.

195
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:20,162
(incantation)

196
00:10:35,947 --> 00:10:38,647
No matter how you bring
a child into this world,

197
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:40,616
it sucks the life out of you.

198
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:43,719
(gasping)

199
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,324
Drek.

200
00:10:52,763 --> 00:10:54,096
(screaming)

201
00:10:58,336 --> 00:11:01,203
(gasping) Your face...

202
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:04,540
- Who...
- I'm your...

203
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,041
mother.

204
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,445
Mama.

205
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:17,052
Brother. It wasn't my fault.

206
00:11:17,088 --> 00:11:20,389
A bad man made me do it.
I had to choose.

207
00:11:20,424 --> 00:11:23,626
- We will kill this man.
- No!

208
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:25,694
I lost you once.

209
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,822
I won't have that happen again.

210
00:11:27,847 --> 00:11:29,398
- Stop!
- I'm sorry.

211
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:31,433
Your skin is young,

212
00:11:31,469 --> 00:11:32,856
but it will toughen.

213
00:11:33,437 --> 00:11:36,805
(screaming)

214
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:39,642
My magic is spent, but as soon
as we cross the boundary,

215
00:11:39,677 --> 00:11:41,806
I will fix this, baby, I promise.

216
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,346
OK, there isn't much time.
We have to go.

217
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:45,846
Come.

218
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,385
I need you to be my big boy.

219
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,634
- (whimpering)
- Drek!

220
00:11:52,356 --> 00:11:54,646
- Shh.
- (grunting)

221
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:56,558
Shh.

222
00:11:56,594 --> 00:11:58,627
A new world awaits us.

223
00:12:00,277 --> 00:12:01,355
And out there,

224
00:12:02,993 --> 00:12:05,393
we will be gods.

225
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:09,536
Then I tossed my badge and said,
"Have fun with your girlfriend".

226
00:12:09,571 --> 00:12:11,938
'Cause he loves work so much.

227
00:12:11,973 --> 00:12:14,240
- But it didn't really land, you know?
- I do not. Lord, girl.

228
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,585
You need to blow off that steam.

229
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:19,978
This mindscrew of a bastard's
calling me a murderer,

230
00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:23,416
and the whole time Dolls
is just... just watching,

231
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:27,253
- when he could've been...
- Rescuing you?

232
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,722
My dear,

233
00:12:28,757 --> 00:12:30,890
I believe Dolls

234
00:12:30,926 --> 00:12:33,757
abandoned that white stallion years ago.

235
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:35,958
I don't need a knight in shining armor.

236
00:12:35,983 --> 00:12:38,517
I just... I need to know
he's got my back.

237
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:41,353
I've learned a thing or two about
Dolls, and I'll tell you this:

238
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:44,089
He is a hypocrite at best,

239
00:12:44,124 --> 00:12:46,825
and a malicious manufacturer
of falsehoods at worst.

240
00:12:49,254 --> 00:12:51,364
Wynonna, you are shaking like a leaf.

241
00:12:52,247 --> 00:12:54,133
I almost killed a guy today.

242
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:59,138
A real live red-blooded human.

243
00:12:59,163 --> 00:13:01,607
It was an honest case
of mistaken identity.

244
00:13:01,641 --> 00:13:03,675
Sadly, in your current profession,

245
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:07,145
it is difficult for you to tell
a revenant from one that is not.

246
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,489
It was more than that.

247
00:13:09,383 --> 00:13:11,614
I wanted to kill something, Doc.

248
00:13:13,006 --> 00:13:14,552
I wanted to stare down the barrel

249
00:13:14,588 --> 00:13:16,855
of Peacemaker and just shoot.

250
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,523
Jesus, listen to me.

251
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:22,795
Maybe I am crazy.

252
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:24,992
You just got the itch.

253
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:28,500
It is a thing rarely articulated,

254
00:13:28,535 --> 00:13:31,403
but there is a power in taking
the life of someone else,

255
00:13:31,438 --> 00:13:34,239
and it is unequalled by
anything else in this world.

256
00:13:34,597 --> 00:13:36,409
It is a dangerous drug.

257
00:13:36,443 --> 00:13:38,443
(sighing)

258
00:13:38,478 --> 00:13:40,645
I guess I'd rather chase the dragon

259
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,715
- than be a pathetic victim.
- Oh, you were never that.

260
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:49,387
- Then what am I?
- Well, you're Wynonna Earp.

261
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,700
Now, I am not sure
this is the best idea.

262
00:14:02,736 --> 00:14:05,837
You're the one who told me
I should blow off steam.

263
00:14:05,872 --> 00:14:08,173
My vast wisdom is a burden.

264
00:14:17,517 --> 00:14:19,651
(whimpering) Oh!

265
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,653
Is it bad?

266
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:25,356
Well, considering the bullet
went through Clootie and not me,

267
00:14:25,392 --> 00:14:27,325
I guess not.

268
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,761
When she gave you almost-immortality,

269
00:14:29,796 --> 00:14:32,497
you became joined. By unnatural forces.

270
00:14:32,532 --> 00:14:35,967
Oh, there are natural
forces at work here.

271
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:40,805
And right now,

272
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:43,608
I am far more interested in them.

273
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,485
"Unnatural." "Otherworldly."

274
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:53,117
"Potential Jack The Ripper."
Really, Nicole? I like a joke

275
00:14:53,152 --> 00:14:54,462
as much as the next guy,

276
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:56,964
- but I don't have time for this.
- It wasn't easy

277
00:14:57,001 --> 00:15:00,018
to write any of that down,
but it is what I experienced.

278
00:15:00,053 --> 00:15:01,105
I swear.

279
00:15:01,852 --> 00:15:02,856
Look,

280
00:15:03,374 --> 00:15:06,041
I know you've had a hell of a time.
You wanna take a day or two,

281
00:15:06,076 --> 00:15:08,543
- I understand.
- This isn't about getting kidnapped.

282
00:15:09,218 --> 00:15:10,678
It's not just that. Sheriff, come on,

283
00:15:10,714 --> 00:15:13,282
you gotta admit this place is weird.

284
00:15:13,317 --> 00:15:16,441
It's a small town, Nicole.

285
00:15:16,476 --> 00:15:17,307
It's quirky.

286
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:19,955
It's called Purgatory, for chrissake.

287
00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:22,165
Look...

288
00:15:24,343 --> 00:15:25,960
if you think it's anything
more than that,

289
00:15:26,613 --> 00:15:28,463
you might as well put in
your resignation.

290
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:31,667
I don't want to resign. I like it here.

291
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,302
Good.

292
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:36,437
I'll redo the report.

293
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:39,975
Door.

294
00:15:54,258 --> 00:15:57,326
(mysterious music)

295
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:01,997
Whoa!

296
00:16:02,032 --> 00:16:04,900
Where's the hold-up?
'Cause you're a cop.

297
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:07,168
Right. Sorry.

298
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:10,939
- Um, can we talk?
- Yyeah. Yeah.

299
00:16:10,974 --> 00:16:12,974
God, we're totally overdue.

300
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,911
I'm not... I'm not crazy, right?

301
00:16:15,946 --> 00:16:19,081
- There's something going on here.
- No. You're not crazy.

302
00:16:19,116 --> 00:16:20,749
- OK.
- I'm not sure

303
00:16:20,784 --> 00:16:24,019
I'm really ready to... get into it.

304
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:25,791
Why?

305
00:16:26,364 --> 00:16:28,590
Because it's different for me, right?

306
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,453
And it's... it's really personal.

307
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:33,729
But it's personal

308
00:16:33,764 --> 00:16:36,965
for everybody, right?
I mean, they must know.

309
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,034
People must whisper about it.

310
00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:42,204
My God, I hope not! No, I...

311
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,506
I kind of only just discovered it.

312
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:48,076
- When I met you.
- Me?

313
00:16:48,112 --> 00:16:49,708
Yeah.

314
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:52,647
You're kinda special.

315
00:16:52,683 --> 00:16:54,783
OK, uh...

316
00:16:54,818 --> 00:16:57,686
Maybe a little bit more open- minded, but
it's not like I have some mystical gift

317
00:16:57,721 --> 00:16:59,788
- or something.
- No, I get it.

318
00:16:59,823 --> 00:17:01,923
You're a lesbian, not a unicorn, right?

319
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,658
- What?
- What?

320
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,383
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

321
00:17:06,418 --> 00:17:07,996
Don't you want to talk?

322
00:17:08,031 --> 00:17:09,865
I want the truth.

323
00:17:13,043 --> 00:17:14,286
Ugh...

324
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:16,805
I think I'd do better with a unicorn.

325
00:17:19,877 --> 00:17:23,311
(dramatic music)

326
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,189
Shit.

327
00:17:36,202 --> 00:17:37,726
No way but out.

328
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:44,499
(growling)

329
00:17:52,717 --> 00:17:54,001
Stay in the car, baby.

330
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:00,982
(growling)

331
00:18:01,018 --> 00:18:03,185
Look at you all.

332
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,320
Roadkill without the "killed" part.

333
00:18:05,355 --> 00:18:06,521
Constance,

334
00:18:07,346 --> 00:18:09,368
you put holes in a few of my boys here.

335
00:18:09,581 --> 00:18:12,494
Tell me about it.
They really messed up my shoes.

336
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:16,142
Yet Peeper here has done you a solid.

337
00:18:25,249 --> 00:18:27,074
Now, I don't know the legal term

338
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,713
you might- but I believe
it's somewhere in the vicinity

339
00:18:30,748 --> 00:18:33,761
of "reckless abandonment."

340
00:18:35,486 --> 00:18:37,252
Bad mommy.

341
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:40,689
(banging on trunk)

342
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:42,791
Peeper.

343
00:18:46,763 --> 00:18:48,734
You don't want to do that.

344
00:18:53,904 --> 00:18:55,937
Holy shit.

345
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:01,176
Baby, I told you

346
00:19:01,211 --> 00:19:03,078
to stay in the car.

347
00:19:03,113 --> 00:19:05,046
I see he's got his father's looks.

348
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:08,383
I'm done with this place.

349
00:19:08,418 --> 00:19:10,785
- That wasn't the deal.
- You lied to me, Bobo.

350
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:13,889
- There's still time.
- Not for me.

351
00:19:13,924 --> 00:19:17,425
- Then give me the Lead.
- (grunting)

352
00:19:20,063 --> 00:19:23,157
Out of all the chances I have given you,

353
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:25,819
you have one chance left.

354
00:19:28,058 --> 00:19:30,105
(gun cocking)

355
00:19:31,368 --> 00:19:32,606
What are you gonna do with it?

356
00:19:32,643 --> 00:19:35,532
- I don't have it.
- What?

357
00:19:35,705 --> 00:19:39,308
All I know is, it's still somewhere

358
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,482
in the triangle.

359
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,788
(piercing roar)

360
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:51,660
- Muzzle that thing now!
- I can't.

361
00:19:51,695 --> 00:19:54,563
You told me the skeletons
were almost complete.

362
00:19:54,598 --> 00:19:57,432
- So we're even.
- Oh, we will be.

363
00:19:57,467 --> 00:20:00,135
- (piercing roar)
- Gimme that thing.

364
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,037
Move it.

365
00:20:03,273 --> 00:20:04,706
Bobo.

366
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:12,180
I can't do it.

367
00:20:12,215 --> 00:20:15,317
(roaring)

368
00:20:17,454 --> 00:20:19,020
No!!

369
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:24,993
No!!

370
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:28,363
No! No!

371
00:20:34,571 --> 00:20:37,305
(whimpering)

372
00:20:37,341 --> 00:20:39,207
What is it?

373
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,242
Are you in pain?

374
00:20:41,278 --> 00:20:44,012
And it's beautiful. The Witch.

375
00:20:44,047 --> 00:20:47,549
I can feel her, and she has
never been in such agony.

376
00:20:47,584 --> 00:20:50,685
- What can I do?
- You can help me.

377
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:53,822
If I can feel her, I can find her.

378
00:20:53,857 --> 00:20:57,092
And then I can kill her.

379
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,695
Whatever's got their claw

380
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,730
in her... Could be waiting

381
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,699
to get their claws in us.

382
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,439
We got to think clearly.
This could be a trap.

383
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:12,303
Trap or no trap, she will
die at my hands today.

384
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,505
If you kill her, you'll die too.

385
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,786
- Doc, you're not really planning...
- Wynonna,

386
00:21:16,821 --> 00:21:19,510
my plan is the same as it was the
day I crawled out of that well.

387
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:22,213
It is a simple plan.
It is a exceptional plan:

388
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:24,248
Kill the witch.

389
00:21:24,941 --> 00:21:27,386
- I won't let you.
- (phone ringing)

390
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:36,222
OK.

391
00:21:37,742 --> 00:21:39,497
I have a plan.

392
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,599
And we will get the Stone Witch,
I promise, but...

393
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:45,470
Doc? Shit!

394
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:52,176
You've been fighting with that coffeepot
for twenty minutes and losing. Come.

395
00:21:52,594 --> 00:21:53,951
That's my mug, Nedley.

396
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,123
Nedley, that's my mug!

397
00:21:58,591 --> 00:22:00,282
Close the door. Sit down.

398
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:03,126
Or not.

399
00:22:05,207 --> 00:22:06,792
- Nedley...
- Randy.

400
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,227
You drink my hooch, you call me Randy.

401
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:10,896
Xavier.

402
00:22:11,477 --> 00:22:14,933
Oh, well, we'll just stick
to what we know, then.

403
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:17,769
You ever notice that we get
some pretty high winds here

404
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:19,093
in Purgatory?

405
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:24,777
You ever notice that weathervane in
the town square always points West?

406
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:33,184
Took it down, oiled it myself.
Works fine, any direction.

407
00:22:33,213 --> 00:22:35,514
But a high wind comes up,
always points West.

408
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,790
Look, if you're leading up
to something, now's a good time

409
00:22:37,825 --> 00:22:40,176
- to get there.
- Well, any given day,

410
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:43,728
Purgatory is like an ER on
a full moon. But you know that,

411
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:47,331
because I think you came here
to investigate the paranormal.

412
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,333
Don't deny it. Guessed it a while back,

413
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:52,629
- decided to keep it under my hat.
- Smart man.

414
00:22:54,174 --> 00:22:55,840
And why don't you keep it there?

415
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:59,977
Look, whatever's going on
in this county nearly got

416
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:02,280
our only deputies killed,
and I don't know about you,

417
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:06,150
but if I lose mine, I gotta go
deputize some fool like Champ Hardy.

418
00:23:06,186 --> 00:23:08,219
(chuckling)

419
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,588
Yeah, that would be a scary
day in Purgatory, huh?

420
00:23:12,513 --> 00:23:13,289
What's all that?

421
00:23:13,314 --> 00:23:14,988
Well, that's a little
on the trailer park.

422
00:23:15,155 --> 00:23:17,628
A little on Bobo Del Rey's enterprises.

423
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:19,564
I've been keeping my eyes and ears open.

424
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:22,700
He's got some powerful friends in town.
I happen to know a few of them.

425
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,338
You know what I do is classified.

426
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:29,254
But if you have any information...

427
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:32,135
Underneath the multiple
layers of asshole,

428
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,979
you seem like a good man. I know that.

429
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:37,241
Then sometimes, you're gonna
have to trust me.

430
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:38,482
I do that,

431
00:23:38,518 --> 00:23:42,954
maybe we can start working
together. Case by case basis.

432
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:44,984
Definitely maybe.

433
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,093
Happy hour's starting.

434
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,591
You want to wander over
to Shorty's with me?

435
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:53,001
I don't drink...

436
00:23:53,026 --> 00:23:55,624
At four o'clock. I know. Neither do I.

437
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:59,961
But sometimes learning things
is just a matter of blending in.

438
00:24:00,329 --> 00:24:02,875
Come on there, "Xavier,"

439
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:05,217
it's time you became one of the people.

440
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:11,582
Waverly, what are you doing?

441
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:14,707
Being alone. I wanna be alone.

442
00:24:14,742 --> 00:24:17,255
Alright, well, you've
reached the edge of town,

443
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,790
so any further out and
you're gonna freeze to death.

444
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:22,284
- Just get in the car.
- No, thank you.

445
00:24:23,263 --> 00:24:26,085
I've got a taser.
Don't you make me use it.

446
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:31,804
OK, so, I'll start.

447
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:34,356
I'm sorry for being
such an asshole before.

448
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:36,807
First you wanna talk,
then you don't wanna talk,

449
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:38,943
- then you tell me to talk...
- OK,

450
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:42,680
well, maybe we should figure out what
exactly it is we're talking about.

451
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:46,484
Gus is selling Shorty's. She
acts like she won't, but she is.

452
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:49,620
And everything is changing around me,
but it's all too fast, you know,

453
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:52,056
and it's like nobody ever asks
me if I'm okay with it.

454
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:54,425
Like, could everybody just stand still

455
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,795
for one frickin' minute?! (sighing)

456
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,552
Hey...

457
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,200
It's gonna be okay.

458
00:25:05,777 --> 00:25:08,440
I just screamed at you.
You shouldn't be nice to me.

459
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:11,409
You know, I think you've just
been dating too many shitheads.

460
00:25:11,444 --> 00:25:13,377
We're not dating.

461
00:25:13,413 --> 00:25:14,800
I know.

462
00:25:15,745 --> 00:25:17,115
God, Waverly,

463
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,075
I would never ask you to be
someone you're not.

464
00:25:19,111 --> 00:25:21,085
Good. Just don't ask me to be anyone.

465
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,045
- Fine.
- Fine.

466
00:25:28,462 --> 00:25:30,162
Well, maybe just friends.

467
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:36,500
Yeah, sure, Waverly. Whatever you want.

468
00:25:42,822 --> 00:25:45,077
Constance Clootie.

469
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:48,546
What kind of a mess have you
gotten yourself into now?

470
00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:53,317
Help me.

471
00:25:53,353 --> 00:25:56,087
Get me across the line,

472
00:25:56,122 --> 00:25:58,489
and I'll give you anything you want.

473
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:01,158
Power. Riches.

474
00:26:01,194 --> 00:26:03,127
A girl. Any girl.

475
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,997
Step into a new life with me.

476
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:08,366
She's an old-school
temptress, ain't she?

477
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:11,202
Or just another washed-up whore.

478
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:14,638
- You lured me, you sow.
- No! No!

479
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,374
He's tricking you!

480
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:17,599
Holliday,

481
00:26:18,211 --> 00:26:20,077
you never disappoint.

482
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:24,937
I was gonna leave her

483
00:26:24,972 --> 00:26:28,786
and her smoldering spawn here,
but then I saw her pain

484
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:33,124
speak to you and, well,
I'm just a sucker for a reunion.

485
00:26:34,394 --> 00:26:37,728
- Well, me too.
- No.

486
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:43,467
- You're just a sucker.
- Says the unarmed revenant.

487
00:26:43,503 --> 00:26:46,637
In a coat Lady Gaga
deemed 'maybe too much'.

488
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:49,707
Wynonna, girl, you are less cut open

489
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:51,076
than I thought you'd be,

490
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:55,346
given your... dance with Jack.

491
00:26:55,887 --> 00:26:57,576
No more speeches.

492
00:26:58,231 --> 00:27:01,019
Just you, me and a gun.

493
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:03,487
Make your Peace.

494
00:27:03,523 --> 00:27:06,057
You cock that Buntline,

495
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:09,927
and I will blow it out of your lily
white hand faster than a fly can blink.

496
00:27:12,468 --> 00:27:16,137
If you shoot, this all goes to shit.

497
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:22,710
Dolls and Nedley are in
the hills with a sniper rifle.

498
00:27:22,746 --> 00:27:25,213
Your poker face is pitiful.

499
00:27:25,248 --> 00:27:27,849
Now put that gun back in your pants.

500
00:27:31,421 --> 00:27:33,688
Well, someone's gun's
already been down there.

501
00:27:33,723 --> 00:27:36,324
Lovers' quarrel?

502
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:38,835
Weapons away, boys. There's a...

503
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:42,530
lady present. You too, Doc.

504
00:27:46,136 --> 00:27:49,437
Bobo Del Rey.

505
00:27:49,472 --> 00:27:51,806
Now did you or did you not vow

506
00:27:51,841 --> 00:27:53,775
to deliver me the witch?

507
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,877
That was before your betrayed me.

508
00:27:55,912 --> 00:27:59,447
Now, now. You have made
similar assurances

509
00:27:59,482 --> 00:28:03,084
to individuals here
who have done much worse.

510
00:28:03,985 --> 00:28:06,256
You've made promises of glory.

511
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:08,489
Promises of escape.

512
00:28:08,525 --> 00:28:12,827
Now, if you were to renege
on one gentleman's agreement,

513
00:28:12,862 --> 00:28:15,530
well, who is to believe

514
00:28:15,565 --> 00:28:17,532
that you would guarantee

515
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:19,567
fulfillment of another?

516
00:28:23,506 --> 00:28:25,640
It ain't that simple.

517
00:28:25,675 --> 00:28:27,241
Oh, but it was,

518
00:28:27,277 --> 00:28:30,645
in the time from which we all hail from.

519
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,849
When a man's word was all that he had.

520
00:28:47,497 --> 00:28:48,996
Alright.

521
00:28:49,878 --> 00:28:54,502
I may have played with her
a little. Broken her spirit.

522
00:28:54,537 --> 00:28:57,004
But she's all yours, Doc.

523
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,040
As pledged.

524
00:29:00,643 --> 00:29:02,944
Now, you see, that proves
I keep my promises.

525
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:06,180
Well, then I am satisfied.

526
00:29:06,216 --> 00:29:09,851
So long as my women
and I have safe passage.

527
00:29:11,685 --> 00:29:12,620
Go.

528
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,957
(cell phone ringing)

529
00:29:18,394 --> 00:29:20,595
- Your women?
- Shut up, Wynonna.

530
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,341
Keep movin'.

531
00:29:27,802 --> 00:29:29,670
Round 'er up, boys.

532
00:29:30,146 --> 00:29:33,006
Well, I hate to gift and run,
but I got another deal pending.

533
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:34,976
As for her,

534
00:29:35,521 --> 00:29:37,010
screw her, torture her.

535
00:29:37,046 --> 00:29:38,514
She's a screamer either way.

536
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,015
Wynonna Earp,

537
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:43,818
I have a very special surprise for you.

538
00:29:56,533 --> 00:29:59,567
♪♪♪

539
00:30:00,273 --> 00:30:01,602
Thank you much.

540
00:30:01,638 --> 00:30:03,571
Need anything else, let me know, OK?

541
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:07,321
Now what?

542
00:30:08,077 --> 00:30:10,427
Now we drink coffee. Observe.

543
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,248
Socialize. Jerry, how you doin'?

544
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,956
So you just did it? You just
went ahead and sold it.

545
00:30:21,991 --> 00:30:24,091
Decisions had to be made.

546
00:30:24,127 --> 00:30:26,127
I know you don't believe me,
but you were not born

547
00:30:26,162 --> 00:30:28,796
- to be a goddamn small town waitress.
- Yeah, I believe you,

548
00:30:28,831 --> 00:30:31,098
but I have, like, three shirts
that say Shorty's.

549
00:30:31,745 --> 00:30:33,367
Honey, it's in the agreement.

550
00:30:33,403 --> 00:30:37,038
Shorty's will never get
torn down. You can work here

551
00:30:37,073 --> 00:30:39,207
in as many shirts as you want
for as long as you want.

552
00:30:39,242 --> 00:30:41,242
- That's not the point...
- But, when you decide

553
00:30:41,277 --> 00:30:44,445
you're ready to unstick
those wings of yours...

554
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:50,117
Don't cash it for a week or so.

555
00:30:50,153 --> 00:30:53,321
- What's this?
- It's freedom, honey.

556
00:30:53,356 --> 00:30:56,324
You've been doing what others
want you to do for so long.

557
00:30:57,588 --> 00:30:59,627
Now you can do whatever it is you want.

558
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:01,736
Which is what?

559
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,130
Live your life.

560
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:05,331
Remember:

561
00:31:05,356 --> 00:31:09,270
some of the best things in life
are the surprises it throws us.

562
00:31:09,864 --> 00:31:11,703
About what we want.

563
00:31:12,475 --> 00:31:14,017
Who we want.

564
00:31:16,131 --> 00:31:17,844
You've always been an honest kid.

565
00:31:18,304 --> 00:31:19,879
Don't stop now.

566
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:28,589
(dramatic music)

567
00:31:29,482 --> 00:31:30,691
Hey.

568
00:31:32,028 --> 00:31:34,195
I got a message for Wynonna Earp.

569
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,387
She's not here.

570
00:31:36,466 --> 00:31:37,898
I can wait.

571
00:31:48,711 --> 00:31:49,910
Doc.

572
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:57,518
(incantation)

573
00:31:59,188 --> 00:32:01,989
- Sorry, no speak evil.
- I wasn't talking to you.

574
00:32:02,025 --> 00:32:04,558
Then who were you talking... Shit!

575
00:32:04,594 --> 00:32:06,961
(incantation)

576
00:32:18,768 --> 00:32:20,040
Honey,

577
00:32:20,076 --> 00:32:22,810
you don't bring table salt
to a witch fight.

578
00:32:22,845 --> 00:32:26,147
- What is that?
- A gift from The Blacksmith.

579
00:32:27,702 --> 00:32:30,684
Gallows Silk. Soaked in the blood

580
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,355
of this pitiful creature,
rendering her power futile.

581
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:37,091
- NOOOO!
- Three months.

582
00:32:37,821 --> 00:32:40,861
One hundred and thirty years.

583
00:32:40,897 --> 00:32:44,765
Retribution does not come quick,
but it will be glorious.

584
00:32:45,077 --> 00:32:46,867
I had a clean shot at Bobo.

585
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:49,970
You would have been dead
before you pulled the trigger.

586
00:32:50,006 --> 00:32:52,340
Bobo and I had a deal.

587
00:32:52,963 --> 00:32:54,775
Who won't you make a deal with, huh?

588
00:32:54,811 --> 00:32:56,970
First a witch, then the Devil himself.

589
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,482
You're nothing like...

590
00:33:01,302 --> 00:33:02,750
You're just nothing.

591
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:06,120
You can judge me all you want.
What do I care

592
00:33:06,155 --> 00:33:08,923
for some broken woman's
evaluation of my character?

593
00:33:10,493 --> 00:33:11,792
(giggling)

594
00:33:11,828 --> 00:33:14,105
Look at all this history

595
00:33:14,141 --> 00:33:15,792
repeating itself.

596
00:33:17,376 --> 00:33:18,799
How many Earps

597
00:33:18,835 --> 00:33:21,635
- can you fail in one lifetime?
- Talk all you want.

598
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:24,331
They are last words anyway.

599
00:33:25,389 --> 00:33:26,941
I know why you were cursed, and how.

600
00:33:26,976 --> 00:33:30,077
I'll tell you if you keep me alive.

601
00:33:30,113 --> 00:33:32,708
- She's lying.
- Could be.

602
00:33:34,754 --> 00:33:36,549
Or could be I'm about to make a deal.

603
00:33:41,609 --> 00:33:42,902
She's stalling.

604
00:33:43,242 --> 00:33:45,242
Don't you want to know this too?

605
00:33:46,502 --> 00:33:47,983
Tell me about the Earp Curse.

606
00:33:49,004 --> 00:33:50,365
The details are hazy,

607
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,462
as that was my demon husband.

608
00:33:52,966 --> 00:33:54,899
Revenge for the death of our boys.

609
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:57,938
Direct and manly

610
00:33:57,973 --> 00:33:59,831
and, quite frankly, boring.

611
00:33:59,866 --> 00:34:03,303
- Not the first word I'd use.
- Us girls like to take vindictiveness

612
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:05,142
to the next level, don't we, Wynonna?

613
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:08,613
And I wanted my own revenge on Wyatt,

614
00:34:08,648 --> 00:34:11,382
so I went after what Wyatt loved most.

615
00:34:12,662 --> 00:34:13,818
His best friend.

616
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:16,422
You're a liar.

617
00:34:16,457 --> 00:34:18,222
I threw it a few juicy morsels

618
00:34:18,258 --> 00:34:21,325
like "health" and "longevity,"

619
00:34:21,361 --> 00:34:23,294
and you were mine.

620
00:34:24,143 --> 00:34:26,547
- You tricked me.
- When Wyatt found you buried

621
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:29,250
in a whore's muff instead of
underground, when he learned

622
00:34:29,745 --> 00:34:30,635
of our deal,

623
00:34:31,852 --> 00:34:32,991
his heart broke in two.

624
00:34:34,578 --> 00:34:36,095
Then I threw you down a well,

625
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:38,597
so that even if Wyatt softened,

626
00:34:39,226 --> 00:34:40,866
came looking for you...

627
00:34:42,242 --> 00:34:45,475
- Did he?
- And you got to spend

628
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,584
decades in the dark,

629
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,609
knowing your best friend despised you.

630
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:52,778
John Henry.

631
00:34:52,813 --> 00:34:55,814
This whole time,
you thought it was personal,

632
00:34:56,237 --> 00:34:58,717
but it's always been
about the alpha dog.

633
00:35:00,076 --> 00:35:02,120
You shut your lyin' mouth.

634
00:35:02,156 --> 00:35:04,156
You're a good sidekick,

635
00:35:04,191 --> 00:35:06,930
dear "Doc," but you'll never be a hero.

636
00:35:07,777 --> 00:35:10,169
A perpetual second choice.

637
00:35:10,204 --> 00:35:13,839
But in the end, everyone
chooses the lawman.

638
00:35:14,514 --> 00:35:15,808
Everyone.

639
00:35:15,843 --> 00:35:18,989
- I'm going to kill you.
- You gave me your word he wouldn't.

640
00:35:19,025 --> 00:35:21,240
If you kill her, you kill yourself.

641
00:35:21,265 --> 00:35:23,773
Then you'll be
the last person I disappoint.

642
00:35:24,585 --> 00:35:27,580
But this inhuman creature
must be made to pay.

643
00:35:27,615 --> 00:35:30,656
Hey, take revenge now, and it's over.

644
00:35:30,691 --> 00:35:33,280
But that coil inside

645
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:34,860
stays just as tight, Doc.

646
00:35:35,772 --> 00:35:38,298
What if her suffering wasn't
just a gunshot away?

647
00:35:38,332 --> 00:35:40,132
What if you could make it last?

648
00:35:41,211 --> 00:35:42,635
You got a better idea?

649
00:35:43,258 --> 00:35:45,637
Yeah, actually, I do.

650
00:35:45,673 --> 00:35:47,873
You can claw your veins out,

651
00:35:47,908 --> 00:35:50,942
it won't come off. Mattie told me.

652
00:35:52,746 --> 00:35:54,913
Stupid white witch healer whore.

653
00:35:54,948 --> 00:35:57,416
What are we doing here,
Wynonna? What is this stuff?

654
00:35:57,451 --> 00:35:58,814
Taste it.

655
00:36:05,392 --> 00:36:08,093
- Salt.
- No!

656
00:36:09,863 --> 00:36:11,972
- No!
- Fields and fields

657
00:36:11,997 --> 00:36:12,964
of the beautiful stuff,

658
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,434
just waiting to snuff out
a witch's powers.

659
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:17,369
Wait, wait! I can...

660
00:36:17,404 --> 00:36:19,404
I can help you get to Bobo.

661
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,007
I know his secrets. I'll work for you.

662
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:23,555
I'll be your slave.

663
00:36:25,279 --> 00:36:28,880
- Listen to me!
- You dig.

664
00:36:30,851 --> 00:36:33,652
Wait a second. If I bury
the witch, what happens to me?

665
00:36:33,687 --> 00:36:35,987
You dig. I bury her.

666
00:36:36,848 --> 00:36:39,925
- Loopholes are a beautiful thing.
- My dear,

667
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,160
you do like to make me sweat.

668
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:50,769
- Hey, Nedley out for dinner?
- You mean happy hour at Shorty's?

669
00:36:50,804 --> 00:36:53,605
Same time every day. Like clockwork.

670
00:36:54,622 --> 00:36:55,640
Hey.

671
00:36:57,277 --> 00:36:58,810
Wave!

672
00:37:03,016 --> 00:37:05,751
Hey! Excuse me.

673
00:37:05,786 --> 00:37:07,886
What is your problem? You...

674
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,435
- What happened to friends?
- You know what I've always wanted?

675
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,630
What?

676
00:37:19,054 --> 00:37:21,300
To parachute out of a plane
at fifteen thousand feet.

677
00:37:21,335 --> 00:37:24,636
Yeah. To swim far,
far out into the ocean

678
00:37:24,671 --> 00:37:26,838
so that I can't see the bottom
anymore. To eat geoduck.

679
00:37:27,198 --> 00:37:29,122
Isn't it the one that kinda
looks like a p...

680
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:30,275
Yeah, it is. Point is,

681
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:34,112
I've always wanted to do things
that scared me. But, well,

682
00:37:34,148 --> 00:37:37,015
it's not so easy to be brazen

683
00:37:38,112 --> 00:37:39,852
when the thing that you want,

684
00:37:39,887 --> 00:37:42,222
that scares you to death,

685
00:37:43,323 --> 00:37:46,425
is sitting right in front of you.

686
00:37:48,054 --> 00:37:49,361
I scare you?

687
00:37:50,386 --> 00:37:51,330
Yes.

688
00:37:51,365 --> 00:37:55,033
Yes, you do. Because
I don't wanna be friends.

689
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,103
When I think about

690
00:37:57,137 --> 00:37:59,704
what I wanna do most in this world...

691
00:38:00,343 --> 00:38:01,441
it's you.

692
00:38:02,976 --> 00:38:05,377
Oh God, that sounded so much
more romantic in my head.

693
00:38:07,347 --> 00:38:09,681
Just jump in any time, Nicole,

694
00:38:09,716 --> 00:38:11,483
because I really, really
don't know how to do this.

695
00:38:12,478 --> 00:38:14,519
Oh, sure you do.

696
00:38:16,398 --> 00:38:17,689
Maybe I should just stop talking.

697
00:38:17,724 --> 00:38:19,190
See,

698
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,784
you're getting better at this already.

699
00:38:22,563 --> 00:38:24,629
Maybe you should stop talking too.

700
00:38:25,335 --> 00:38:27,333
Maybe you should make me.

701
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:53,825
(laughing) Sorry.

702
00:38:53,861 --> 00:38:56,862
I just... I told him I had it.

703
00:38:56,897 --> 00:38:58,897
And then he went

704
00:38:58,932 --> 00:39:00,999
and he collected all the bones,

705
00:39:01,034 --> 00:39:03,001
but I lost the Lead.

706
00:39:03,036 --> 00:39:05,937
Constance, you gotta watch
the tears. This mascara

707
00:39:05,973 --> 00:39:08,540
is clearly not waterproof, and it's not
like you can touch it up yourself.

708
00:39:08,575 --> 00:39:10,852
Now what is this damn lead?

709
00:39:11,303 --> 00:39:14,045
It's the one thing
he'll never stop searching for.

710
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,961
The one thing he needs.

711
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:19,328
For what?

712
00:39:19,853 --> 00:39:22,787
To escape the Ghost River
Triangle. The Curse.

713
00:39:22,823 --> 00:39:25,201
And you, Wynonna Earp.

714
00:39:25,526 --> 00:39:28,927
You and your promise of death.

715
00:39:30,797 --> 00:39:33,932
Dry your tears, witch.

716
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:37,235
With this amount of salt keeping
you, you'll be pickled in no time.

717
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:39,905
Wait! Don't...

718
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,257
don't leave me!

719
00:39:42,676 --> 00:39:44,609
No, no, wait!

720
00:39:44,645 --> 00:39:47,379
I don't want to be left alone!

721
00:39:47,414 --> 00:39:49,948
I owe you a heap of thanks. And my life.

722
00:39:49,983 --> 00:39:53,652
Well, keep your life, Doc.
I'd only mess it up.

723
00:39:54,178 --> 00:39:55,621
Can I at least buy you a drink?

724
00:39:55,656 --> 00:39:58,790
(cell phone ringing)

725
00:40:01,093 --> 00:40:02,861
I gotta get back.

726
00:40:02,896 --> 00:40:05,664
I thought the Deputy Marshal was
no longer in your good graces.

727
00:40:08,556 --> 00:40:09,569
Rain check on the drink?

728
00:40:09,603 --> 00:40:11,636
Later, at home. You, me,

729
00:40:11,672 --> 00:40:13,872
and a forty of something delicious.

730
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:18,276
You sure no one
is gonna find her out here?

731
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,948
She'll be alone forever.

732
00:40:21,982 --> 00:40:24,916
I don't want to be alone!

733
00:40:24,952 --> 00:40:28,153
Come back! A sad fate indeed.

734
00:40:28,188 --> 00:40:31,356
Come back!

735
00:40:31,391 --> 00:40:33,491
(screaming)

736
00:40:34,994 --> 00:40:37,196
You passed the second assessment

737
00:40:37,231 --> 00:40:38,414
with flying colors.

738
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:39,765
- I didn't take a...
- Sure, you did.

739
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,256
Early this afternoon.
Don't you remember?

740
00:40:44,284 --> 00:40:48,199
I mean, you had three energy drinks and
you swore like a truck driver,

741
00:40:48,235 --> 00:40:50,420
but yeah, you passed.

742
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:53,588
- That sure sounds like me.
- There you go.

743
00:40:55,156 --> 00:40:57,123
But this does not sound like you.

744
00:40:57,158 --> 00:40:58,700
Say something Dolls would say.

745
00:40:59,561 --> 00:41:01,298
You're a good deputy, Earp.

746
00:41:03,874 --> 00:41:05,865
No, that's not it.

747
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,601
I'm not good at apologies or...

748
00:41:08,636 --> 00:41:11,537
- Feelings.
- Come on.

749
00:41:11,573 --> 00:41:14,187
I got you a gift.

750
00:41:14,676 --> 00:41:18,444
Aw, Dolls.

751
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:22,048
You really do care.

752
00:41:36,335 --> 00:41:37,396
Out of everyone,

753
00:41:37,432 --> 00:41:39,632
Bobo chose me to bring you his message.

754
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:41,876
Then I'm going to kill you. He
knows that, right?

755
00:41:41,911 --> 00:41:43,668
It's my honor to serve him.

756
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:46,272
It's worth dying, to see
the look on your face.

757
00:41:46,307 --> 00:41:49,809
- What look?
- The message from Bobo to you is this:

758
00:41:49,844 --> 00:41:51,911
Bobo bought Shorty's.

759
00:41:51,946 --> 00:41:54,146
Ha, ha, ha! See?

760
00:41:54,182 --> 00:41:56,349
That's the look right there.

761
00:41:56,384 --> 00:41:58,985
It's freakin' great!

762
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:04,690
It's ours now, my fellow
deviants and degenerates.

763
00:42:04,726 --> 00:42:07,059
And what it holds will aid

764
00:42:07,095 --> 00:42:09,261
in our eternal salvation!

765
00:42:11,933 --> 00:42:13,921
And Wynonna Earp's

766
00:42:14,802 --> 00:42:18,471
final damnation.

767
00:42:18,506 --> 00:42:20,473
(cheering and whooping)

768
00:42:20,508 --> 00:42:23,309
Let it all begin!

769
00:42:29,183 --> 00:42:32,385
(cheering)
