1
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:21,029
Morning

2
00:02:21,064 --> 00:02:23,389
Good morning, Mr. Bullock

3
00:02:25,424 --> 00:02:27,556
Mr. Bullock.

4
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:30,917
Good morning.  Good morning, Sophia.  Sorry to interrupt your lesson.

5
00:02:30,952 --> 00:02:32,845
We’re finished

6
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,253
No, we’re not, Sophia, and we’ll continue downstairs.

7
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:49,549
Hills get divided into three counties.  Each county has a commissioner.

8
00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:52,914
Appointed by fucking who?

9
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:54,010
The governor.

10
00:02:54,045 --> 00:02:55,628
When the fuck does that happen?

11
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:57,510
It already did.

12
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,443
Anyone I know?

13
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:05,029
They’re all from Yankton.

14
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:13,470
Well, being as you’re the bearer of unsettling news, why don’t you step the fuck inside?

15
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,901
No one from the fucking hills, huh?

16
00:03:17,902 --> 00:03:19,956
All Pennington’s people.

17
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:25,848
Saves time.  Just travel to one destination, murder the three of ‘em.

18
00:03:25,883 --> 00:03:29,042
See how they like being commissioner after they’re dead.

19
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:35,409
Coach coming, Lila.

20
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:38,080
With your friend and her girls?

21
00:03:38,115 --> 00:03:41,969
I don’t know.  It’s still way up in the hills.

22
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:43,977
You want me to come watch with you?

23
00:03:44,012 --> 00:03:51,049
Oh, no, no.  Well, okay.  Well, do whatever you want, but I’ll wait outside for you.

24
00:03:52,796 --> 00:03:57,313
All the invoices other than this mission from Hendy Iron have been acted on.

25
00:03:57,348 --> 00:03:58,314
I see.

26
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:01,473
You’ll note I’ve made partial payment to them…

27
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:02,784
Yes.

28
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,953
Questioning a possible duplication.

29
00:04:04,988 --> 00:04:07,040
For the bill hooks?

30
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:08,444
Yes.

31
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,735
Is that my worth?

32
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:17,408
That’s the amount on deposit.  Your worth is considerably more.

33
00:04:20,252 --> 00:04:25,881
Thank you for your attention in all these matters, Mr. Bullock.

34
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,601
You’re welcome.

35
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:44,171
He wrote you a letter.  Pennington.

36
00:04:44,206 --> 00:04:45,913
That you held from me till now?

37
00:04:45,948 --> 00:04:47,721
To say what I knew first.

38
00:04:58,992 --> 00:05:01,105
Please be seated.

39
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,128
Yes, it has fallen to this.

40
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:35,306
Damn.

41
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:44,674
Mr. Ellsworth!  Is the Garret gold in readiness for shipment to Denver?

42
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:46,579
That it is.

43
00:05:49,074 --> 00:06:00,658
I would expect a delay before the owner blesses its passage.
While little Sophia is off with her tutor, Mrs. Garret consults with Mr. Bullock.

44
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,234
Alright.

45
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:06,302
In Bullock’s capacity, of course, as her claim’s trustee.

46
00:06:07,654 --> 00:06:11,926
That’s all the cleverness on that subject I’m inclined to hear from you.

47
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:25,502
Fat. Cat.

48
00:06:32,294 --> 00:06:35,390
Biscuits?  Piping fresh.

49
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:38,437
Yeah, when both of us was young.

50
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:50,094
Ah!

51
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:52,148
Anyways, I could use a bath.

52
00:06:52,183 --> 00:06:57,806
I urge you, Mr. Swearengen, not to take as injury to your interests my appointing only men from Yankton.

53
00:06:57,841 --> 00:07:01,658
For not being of the region, such men serving as commissioners 

54
00:07:01,693 --> 00:07:05,785
I hold less likely to obstruct those like yourself 

55
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,265
who actively pursue their destinies in the hills.

56
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,129
In those brave endeavors, be assured of my best hopes, 

57
00:07:13,164 --> 00:07:17,815
high esteem and continued gratitude for your gestures of support.

58
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:21,789
Governor Pennington.

59
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:25,052
Well, that’s just the fucking sort – chop ‘em into pieces, 

60
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:28,070
and each of ‘em happily slithers away,

61
00:07:28,105 --> 00:07:30,147
still lying to your fucking face.

62
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:32,308
What am I to make of this, huh?

63
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:34,377
He don’t know yet what he wants to do.

64
00:07:34,378 --> 00:07:36,784
Knew what to do with them fucking bribes I sent.

65
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:38,579
That’s a gift they’re born with.  

66
00:07:38,614 --> 00:07:40,121
Far as how hard to move on the camp, 

67
00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:44,602
He ain’t sure yet all he’d be going against.

68
00:07:45,312 --> 00:07:47,808
Maybe that is cause for cutting some throat.

69
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,508
That’d put you right where he wants you.

70
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:52,377
If you got other ways to move on him is what he ain’t clear about.

71
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:32,145
Messages from invisible sources, or what some people think of as progress.

72
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,752
Ain’t the heathens used smoke signals all through recorded history?

73
00:08:35,787 --> 00:08:37,532
How’s that a fucking recommendation?

74
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:44,968
Well, it seems to me like, you know, letters posted one person to another is just a slower version of the same idea.

75
00:08:45,003 --> 00:08:47,335
When’s the last time you got a fucking letter from a stranger?

76
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,224
Bad news about Pa.

77
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:51,304
Bad news!

78
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:54,671
Or tries against our interests is our sole communications from strangers,

79
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:57,560
so by all means, let’s plant poles all across the country,

80
00:08:57,595 --> 00:09:03,064
festoon the cocksucker with wires to hurry the sorry word 
and blinker our judgments of motive, huh?

81
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:05,113
You’ve given it more thought than me.

82
00:09:05,148 --> 00:09:09,468
Ain’t the state of things cloudy enough?  Don’t we face enough fucking imponderables?

83
00:09:09,503 --> 00:09:13,504
Well, by God, you give the word, Al, 
and them poles will be kindling.

84
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:23,770
After we’ve made love, are you sometimes happy?

85
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:30,344
Because I get up from the bed, is that why you wonder?

86
00:09:36,831 --> 00:09:49,808
I’ll intend something, come to myself realizing I’ve only stood or sat thinking about you.

87
00:09:49,843 --> 00:09:56,552
Just now, that your toes are beautiful, when I’d intended to replenish the kindling.

88
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:10,336
I was raised believing dereliction of duty is the one sure way to happiness.

89
00:10:11,128 --> 00:10:17,292
So often with you I’ve been perfectly happy.

90
00:10:19,943 --> 00:10:24,808
Can I start the shipment loading to keep the men from falling to drink?

91
00:10:24,843 --> 00:10:26,744
Yes, please.

92
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:34,191
Now I believe in you.

93
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,143
Start loading.

94
00:10:44,673 --> 00:10:53,416
Does Bullock think if I wanted, them four horsemen with rifles would ward me off that woman’s gold?

95
00:10:53,451 --> 00:10:56,655
Maybe it’s just precautions against the other operators.

96
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,448
No precautions of his protect her.

97
00:10:58,483 --> 00:11:00,793
Them other operators forebear out of respect for me

98
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:04,664
and knowing what hot blood your blade would draw 
if they ever fucking presumed.

99
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:06,956
Well, he don’t intend it as insult.

100
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:09,005
Uh, Bullock, that’s my point.

101
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,709
Horror is you’re fucking right!

102
00:11:10,744 --> 00:11:14,485
He don’t know if it’s breathing or taking it in through fucking gills

103
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,310
He is that fucking cunt-struck.

104
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:20,943
They’re afloat in some fairy fucking bubble, lighter than air

105
00:11:20,978 --> 00:11:24,606
him, her snatch and his stupid fucking badge.

106
00:11:29,365 --> 00:11:31,798
Where’s that from?

107
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,238
My guess would be number 10.

108
00:11:34,273 --> 00:11:37,694
Hope it ain’t Tom Nuttall taking the quick fucking way out.

109
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:40,970
No. No, there’s himself.

110
00:11:48,383 --> 00:11:55,165
Self-deceiving cocksucker I am, I thought when America took us in, Bullock would prove a fucking resource…

111
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,189
look at him, striding out like some randy maniac Bishop.

112
00:11:59,224 --> 00:12:03,190
Sheriff!  About his duties to the camp, huh?

113
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:05,357
Luck trouble didn’t jump out earlier, huh, Bullock?

114
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,628
Might have found you mid-thrust at other business.

115
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:13,363
What is it?  Taken by a vision?

116
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:19,599
You would not want to be staring like that – at me.

117
00:12:19,634 --> 00:12:24,710
It’s only Bummer Dan.  But I-I think he’s killed.

118
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,925
Be where I can find you.

119
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,133
I ain’t going no place.

120
00:12:48,952 --> 00:12:50,973
I’ll, uh, go get my big gun.

121
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:54,742
No, that ain’t how this wants to resolve.

122
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:58,782
You go down, Dan, see to the cunt and whiskey, huh?

123
00:12:58,817 --> 00:13:00,057
You want me up here?

124
00:13:00,092 --> 00:13:03,014
You, go take your bath.

125
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:18,238
You want a donkey’s attention…
bring a fucking pole down between his ears

126
00:13:23,277 --> 00:13:27,710
Jeez.
Ow, fuck!

127
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,205
No ways did I wish that man harm or take against him.

128
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,030
You did shoot him, huh?

129
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,141
Only on account of the jacket.

130
00:13:37,176 --> 00:13:39,158
I’ll hear it from the other drunks.

131
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,806
Harry mistook Bummer Dan for Slippery Dan.

132
00:13:41,841 --> 00:13:45,229
That had pulled his cock out previous, started filling the cuspidor yon!

133
00:13:45,264 --> 00:13:46,829
You will keep this short.

134
00:13:46,864 --> 00:13:49,718
Well, uh, Harry shouts for Slippery to stop,

135
00:13:49,753 --> 00:13:54,479
but slippery cast his Johnson toward Harry and pisses at him over the bar.

136
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:59,445
I pulled my gun, sheriff.  I told Slippery, 
“Get out, you’re ruled off for the day.

137
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,038
You darken that door before dawn tomorrow, 
I’ll shoot you fucking dead.”

138
00:14:03,073 --> 00:14:05,998
Harry’s shirt front’s urine-sopped still.

139
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:08,246
But this is Bummer Dan.

140
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:11,558
Oh my God, it’s true!

141
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:14,038
Well, that’s Slippery.

142
00:14:14,073 --> 00:14:16,358
Bummer’s fucking dead.

143
00:14:16,393 --> 00:14:18,501
They know that, you filthy piss-spraying beast!

144
00:14:18,536 --> 00:14:20,417
Get up off your knees.

145
00:14:20,452 --> 00:14:21,753
Oh my God, Bummer –

146
00:14:21,788 --> 00:14:23,337
Get up and tell your part of this.

147
00:14:23,372 --> 00:14:28,501
My part, sheriff, was putting Bummer in my jacket 
and sending the poor fuck in here.

148
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:30,533
To what purpose?

149
00:14:30,568 --> 00:14:32,598
Thinking maybe if Harry winged one at Bummer

150
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:37,878
mistaking him for me he threatened to murder, it’d be funny.

151
00:14:40,424 --> 00:14:42,462
What’s my liability, Mr. Bullock?

152
00:14:42,497 --> 00:14:45,437
Hey, ain’t getting pissed on provocation?

153
00:14:46,605 --> 00:14:52,941
You didn’t kill you meant to, or mean to kill the man you did.

154
00:14:57,837 --> 00:15:02,454
What’s my liability?  Worse in some way?

155
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:10,194
Box him and see he’s buried.  But I’m telling both of you, watch it!

156
00:15:11,982 --> 00:15:15,326
May I retrieve my jacket off him, Deputy?

157
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:16,864
Yeah, go ahead.

158
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:21,581
Gee, the worst fucking joke I ever played!

159
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:25,110
Oh, why do I drink the way I do?

160
00:15:25,145 --> 00:15:29,454
He pulls that prick stunt again, shoot him!

161
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:37,203
Wait up, Bullock!

162
00:15:37,238 --> 00:15:38,670
Private bidness, thanks.

163
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:42,764
It won’t be private if Swearengen’s got his cappers at his flanks.

164
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,146
It’s private.  Thank you, Charlie.

165
00:15:46,181 --> 00:15:47,660
Soap with a prize inside!

166
00:15:47,695 --> 00:15:50,227
You got any prizes in that meat there, captain?

167
00:15:50,262 --> 00:15:51,566
This cocksucker.

168
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:54,826
Friend, I got soap with a prize inside.

169
00:15:54,861 --> 00:16:00,012
You were told to keep an interval between yourself and legitimate merchants.

170
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:04,067
I-I keep my interval, Sheriff.  It’s their increase what’s crowding me—

171
00:16:04,102 --> 00:16:07,095
We’re gonna count out 25 paces.  We’re at 14.  Count them with me. 15!

172
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,475
15.

173
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:13,368
16, 17… 18, 19, 20…

174
00:16:13,403 --> 00:16:17,018
Why, Joanie Stubbs and Miss Lila.

175
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:22,467
What brings you to the air this fine spring morning?

176
00:16:22,502 --> 00:16:24,451
Stage from Bismarck.

177
00:16:24,486 --> 00:16:27,339
Bismarck, you say?

178
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:30,587
Don’t the kid in all of us look forward to the new arrival?

179
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:35,668
I still tingle at the bottom of my balls.
Who could it be?

180
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:41,219
President Hayes?
Maybe it’s jugglers or face painters.

181
00:16:41,254 --> 00:16:43,611
Where do you feel it, honey?

182
00:16:43,646 --> 00:16:47,155
The bottom of your balls.

183
00:16:57,478 --> 00:16:59,642
Air’s gone a little fixed.

184
00:16:59,677 --> 00:17:02,753
I guess we know who fixed it.

185
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,395
Excuse me.

186
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:13,764
Look at the man in the creek, Mama.

187
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,482
He’s panning for his fortune.

188
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:17,323
Won’t see Mr. Bullock in the creek, though.

189
00:17:17,358 --> 00:17:18,883
No.

190
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:20,947
Didn’t you say he was the Sheriff?

191
00:17:20,982 --> 00:17:24,451
Part owner of Bullock and Star hardware, Sheriff of Deadwood camp.

192
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:37,738
Cocksuckers!

193
00:17:51,131 --> 00:17:52,963
Bullock.

194
00:17:52,998 --> 00:17:55,063
Do I need to watch my back against you?

195
00:17:55,098 --> 00:17:58,018
Al said to stay out of it.

196
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,170
Good Morning.

197
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:43,523
If you’d spare your partner a gutting, Mr. Star,

198
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:45,430
you might make your way to the Gem.

199
00:18:45,465 --> 00:18:47,088
A gutting at whose hand?

200
00:18:47,123 --> 00:18:48,220
My boss called him out clear across the thoroughfare.

201
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:50,895
Unprovoked?

202
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,726
He was seeing after Mrs. Garret’s interests – your partner – 
when my boss shouted.

203
00:19:00,327 --> 00:19:01,968
Would you lock up for me, please?

204
00:19:02,003 --> 00:19:03,167
Sure.

205
00:19:04,014 --> 00:19:06,534
Your boss should do like me and learn to look the other way!

206
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:08,696
It ain’t his line.

207
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:17,184
Age impedes my stream, no fucking fear of you.

208
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:18,366
Get in here.

209
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:23,670
All in due fucking course, but tell me one thing first, Bullock, as I stand here fucking humbled.

210
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:28,672
Does the widow Garret have a going fucking hard rock concern

211
00:19:28,707 --> 00:19:33,630
and five-stamp mill crushing gold out of her quartz all day and fucking night?

212
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:34,670
What?

213
00:19:34,705 --> 00:19:36,774
But does she cast her lot with the camp,

214
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:42,184
furnish others here a chance to develop what they got, 
to hang on or even prosper?

215
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:46,983
You pie-faced cocksucker.  Get in here and account for your insult.

216
00:19:47,018 --> 00:19:50,271
Or, with you at her ear –
among other points of entry –

217
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:53,679
instead of doing your civic duty, 
does she ship her fucking loot to Denver?

218
00:19:53,714 --> 00:19:54,670
Civic duty?

219
00:19:54,705 --> 00:19:57,155
Opposed by her own and her dead husband’s family,

220
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:01,110
to put her assets at play in a camp with no law 
or government worth the name?

221
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:04,138
See as here where she lives and struck lucky, civic duty?

222
00:20:04,173 --> 00:20:08,360
Yeah.  And it’s time for her and some others to quit their fucking shirking.

223
00:20:08,395 --> 00:20:13,520
Yankton’s making it’s move. Ah, the fucking thing!

224
00:20:13,555 --> 00:20:16,326
Meaning what?
“Yankton’s making it’s move?”

225
00:20:16,361 --> 00:20:19,422
Without more insults.

226
00:20:19,457 --> 00:20:20,726
We’re getting ass-fucked.

227
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:25,191
Carved into counties, but not one fucking 
commissioner coming from the hills.

228
00:20:25,226 --> 00:20:27,271
How do you have this information?

229
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:30,351
From the governor himself in a pricey little personal note.

230
00:20:30,386 --> 00:20:33,958
They want to make us a trough for Yankton’s snouts.

231
00:20:33,993 --> 00:20:35,255
And them hoopleheads out there, 

232
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,204
they need buttressing against going over to those cocksuckers.

233
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:40,340
Now, I can handle my areas, 

234
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,109
but there’s dimensions and fucking angles I’m not expert at

235
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:46,319
You would be if you’d sheathe your prick long enough.

236
00:20:46,354 --> 00:20:47,277
Shut up.

237
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:50,802
And resume being the upright pain in the balls 
that graced us all, last summer.

238
00:20:50,837 --> 00:20:53,541
Shut up, you son of a bitch.

239
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:58,773
Jesus Christ.  Bullock!  

240
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:04,991
The world abounds in cunt of every kind, including hers.

241
00:21:17,507 --> 00:21:22,727
Of course, if it would steer you from something stupid…

242
00:21:22,762 --> 00:21:28,710
I, uh, could always profess another position.

243
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,229
Will I find you’ve got a knife?

244
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,312
I won’t need no fucking knife.

245
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,270
They went over the fucking balcony!

246
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:25,652
Awful possibility in these matters is both men sustaining mortal injury.

247
00:22:27,572 --> 00:22:28,629
Whoa!

248
00:22:28,664 --> 00:22:31,230
You looking to die, cocksucker?

249
00:22:36,854 --> 00:22:38,309
He ain’t your kill!

250
00:22:38,344 --> 00:22:42,389
Hey, hey.  Hey, don’t come no further! Hey!

251
00:22:45,246 --> 00:22:53,061
Jesus Christ!  Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ Almighty!

252
00:22:56,365 --> 00:22:57,621
Where’s Bullock?

253
00:22:57,656 --> 00:22:59,759
Fuck me.

254
00:22:59,794 --> 00:23:03,553
I do have a knife.  It come to me now.

255
00:23:03,588 --> 00:23:06,409
Hmm?

256
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:22,225
Welcome to fucking Deadwood!  It can be combative.

257
00:23:26,835 --> 00:23:29,606
But I’m rarely that fucking lucky.

258
00:23:42,703 --> 00:23:45,000
Wave a penny under the Jew’s nose.

259
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:49,917
If they’ve got living breath in them, it brings them right ‘round.

260
00:24:01,246 --> 00:24:03,052
Mr. Bullock.

261
00:24:03,087 --> 00:24:05,623
A happy surprise.

262
00:24:05,658 --> 00:24:10,284
No one’s dead.  Mr. Star’s shoulder’s been hurt.

263
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:13,588
Ain’t that your high-end whore friend Maddie?

264
00:24:13,623 --> 00:24:14,818
Yes.

265
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,618
That I thought had took her snatch to New York?

266
00:24:17,653 --> 00:24:19,138
Yes.

267
00:24:19,173 --> 00:24:22,403
Wonderful how folks can get around now.

268
00:24:25,483 --> 00:24:28,139
Doc Cochran needs to come from Whitewood.

269
00:24:28,174 --> 00:24:33,522
Yeah
A.W. Merrick.

270
00:24:33,557 --> 00:24:37,290
Mr. Star and Utter should be taken to our store.

271
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:39,554
All right.  All right.

272
00:24:40,589 --> 00:24:43,581
Hello, Mr. Bullock.

273
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:47,303
Hello, William.  I’m all right.

274
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:54,899
I’d be grateful if you’d take their belongings to a house 
I built on the west edge.

275
00:24:54,934 --> 00:24:56,595
Mm-hmm.

276
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:11,878
Better let me hold Maddie’s chair, Joanie.

277
00:25:14,106 --> 00:25:17,163
I need to make a fucking impression.  My lady.

278
00:25:17,198 --> 00:25:18,547
My Lord.

279
00:25:22,344 --> 00:25:25,304
Lack of notice is my only regret.

280
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:27,831
That’s my fault for giving Joanie none.

281
00:25:27,866 --> 00:25:30,048
Were you hedging your bets, Maddie?

282
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:34,514
Feared losing my nerve all the way to the camp.

283
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:38,551
Then wondered, had that coach brought you to Gettysburg, huh?

284
00:25:40,516 --> 00:25:42,475
Gettysburgh – fucking battle carnage.

285
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,601
Yes, I wondered.

286
00:25:43,636 --> 00:25:44,652
What?

287
00:25:44,687 --> 00:25:45,631
Wondered.

288
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:52,174
You secured that building, Honey, when?

289
00:25:52,209 --> 00:25:55,158
November.

290
00:25:55,193 --> 00:25:58,946
Got the building in November I guess you’ll be operating out of?

291
00:25:59,403 --> 00:26:01,036
Now I’d have thought a trick would have been behind it, 

292
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,624
but Joanie’s fuck money has been going for Jewels.

293
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,765
How long have we had that understanding, Honey?

294
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:06,970
Since I was 14.

295
00:26:07,882 --> 00:26:12,896
I’ve been giving Joanie jewels for her fuck money 
since she was 14 years of age,

296
00:26:12,931 --> 00:26:15,119
and not once did I come out ahead.

297
00:26:15,154 --> 00:26:16,896
Anyways.

298
00:26:16,931 --> 00:26:24,672
Anyways…Since November, it looked to me the project lay fallow,

299
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:27,049
but I guess it was just germinating.

300
00:26:27,084 --> 00:26:28,923
Shall we talk in private, Cy?

301
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:30,073
Would that be rude?

302
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:30,863
Not at all.

303
00:26:30,898 --> 00:26:34,296
I mean, a 18-year relationship between me and Joanie,

304
00:26:34,331 --> 00:26:35,824
- just one moment alone?

305
00:26:35,859 --> 00:26:37,666
Of course not.

306
00:26:40,128 --> 00:26:42,081
Suck some pricks if you like.

307
00:26:42,116 --> 00:26:44,840
Keep whatever they give you as my way of saying welcome.

308
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,559
Any blind ones out there?

309
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:53,004
Jesus Christ!

310
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,859
That bandage wants to be tight, Al.

311
00:26:54,894 --> 00:26:55,753
That does it!

312
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:58,108
Ask it if it wants to be wound around your fucking neck!

313
00:26:58,143 --> 00:26:59,571
Get away from me, Barney!

314
00:26:59,606 --> 00:27:00,342
Yes, sir.

315
00:27:02,556 --> 00:27:03,804
Fucking Adams.

316
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,947
Restrained you, didn’t he?

317
00:27:06,982 --> 00:27:10,835
Obstructs me in the thoroughfare.  Now he wants to bill and coo.

318
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,395
Fuck!

319
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,950
What was that Jewish fella thinking, Dan,

320
00:27:15,985 --> 00:27:17,372
To charge at me with a purse gun?

321
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,723
That’s just an unfamiliar situation.

322
00:27:22,758 --> 00:27:25,775
He just overplayed trying to prove himself.

323
00:27:26,007 --> 00:27:26,977
Fuck, fuck.

324
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,184
What was that whole damn thing about anyhow?

325
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:32,512
Al’s calling Bullock to the fold.

326
00:27:32,547 --> 00:27:35,879
Bullock ain’t even of Al’s flock.

327
00:27:35,914 --> 00:27:40,072
Al’s gonna be calling numbers to the fold now that he can’t trust like us.

328
00:27:40,107 --> 00:27:45,998
Some he don’t even like.  We’re joining America.

329
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:50,480
And it’s full of lying, thieving cocksuckers that you can’t trust at all

330
00:27:50,515 --> 00:27:53,358
– governors, commissioners and whatnot.

331
00:27:53,393 --> 00:27:56,810
By God, that’s just the new way of things.

332
00:27:56,845 --> 00:27:58,411
And you just gonna have to get used to it, Johnny.

333
00:27:58,446 --> 00:27:59,519
All right.

334
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:02,894
You gonna have to accept it and learn to control yourself.

335
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:05,553
You get no argument from me!

336
00:28:05,588 --> 00:28:06,968
Okay.

337
00:28:07,003 --> 00:28:09,817
It’s been me nudging you from the nest, young lady,

338
00:28:09,852 --> 00:28:11,600
urging you to take fucking wing.

339
00:28:11,635 --> 00:28:12,454
Okay.

340
00:28:14,983 --> 00:28:18,158
Where did the money come from that bought that place?

341
00:28:18,193 --> 00:28:24,319
Your daddy sold me you for six and a half bucks, so a rich relation is tough to swallow.

342
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,463
It is respectful not to lie, Honey,

343
00:28:29,498 --> 00:28:32,519
but any further silence will get me violent.

344
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,975
You know where that backing came from.

345
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:39,416
A farewell gesture from Eddie Sawyer!

346
00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:44,502
I knew Eddie had been stealing from me,

347
00:28:44,537 --> 00:28:47,375
and then he flees and you turn up owning our place.

348
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,559
I don’t work here no more, Cy.

349
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:52,671
You understand?  No matter what.

350
00:28:52,706 --> 00:28:58,648
Hmm.  It’s kill you or let you go.

351
00:29:01,777 --> 00:29:03,959
Could I make it with you dead?

352
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:06,132
Why try?

353
00:29:09,904 --> 00:29:12,263
Look at that.

354
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:16,806
Look at that beautiful smile.

355
00:29:22,211 --> 00:29:30,234
All right, darling.  Let me…let you go.

356
00:29:33,867 --> 00:29:35,607
Thank you.

357
00:29:38,072 --> 00:29:39,661
Shall we

358
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,072
All take air while Maddie hears the happy news?

359
00:29:47,103 --> 00:29:49,327
Let’s go get the fucking crone.

360
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,200
I feel like a – a boy.  I feel like skipping.

361
00:29:56,521 --> 00:29:59,286
I’m that fucking hopeful and excited for you.

362
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:08,087
Doc, hot water.

363
00:30:08,922 --> 00:30:13,343
Tell Wu that that drunk better not get ate by his pigs

364
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:16,152
until I have had my way with the corpse.

365
00:30:16,187 --> 00:30:19,277
I’m braced, Doc, if you want to start digging.

366
00:30:19,312 --> 00:30:20,613
Momentarily.

367
00:30:23,837 --> 00:30:27,470
Oh, Thank you, Ma’am.  The ringing…

368
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:34,595
I’m all right, William.

369
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,476
Where are you gun and badge, Mr. Bullock?

370
00:30:38,511 --> 00:30:45,379
It was personal between me and the man I fought, so I took them off.

371
00:30:45,414 --> 00:30:47,383
But he kept a knife.

372
00:30:47,418 --> 00:30:50,348
I didn’t know that when I disarmed.

373
00:30:50,383 --> 00:30:52,431
Will you arrest him now for the knife?

374
00:30:52,466 --> 00:30:54,796
That’s questions enough for Mr. Bullock, William.

375
00:30:56,884 --> 00:30:59,768
Give him a dose of that laudanum.

376
00:31:01,388 --> 00:31:04,003
I got my load on, Doc.

377
00:31:10,107 --> 00:31:15,156
Don’t doubt…I’ll have back my gun and badge.

378
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:21,165
Shh…shh.

379
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,629
Shh…shh

380
00:31:32,664 --> 00:31:36,708
Shh…shh.

381
00:31:48,394 --> 00:31:49,363
Fuck.

382
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:53,658
I found these seeing to you piss-pot, and I know they ain’t yours.

383
00:31:53,693 --> 00:31:56,387
What tipped you off, the fucking badge?

384
00:31:56,422 --> 00:31:58,142
Put them down

385
00:32:00,936 --> 00:32:04,035
Is that some kind of private fucking hilarity?

386
00:32:04,069 --> 00:32:05,409
What?

387
00:32:05,444 --> 00:32:06,624
The piss-pot remark.

388
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:07,705
No.

389
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:12,569
I made water off the balcony this morning, 
if it’s any of your fucking business.

390
00:32:12,604 --> 00:32:13,722
Now get away from me.

391
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:17,010
Not you E.B!  Get the fuck back here.

392
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:22,660
Heavens.  It’s all like some great Greek battle.

393
00:32:22,695 --> 00:32:24,352
Yeah, how about that fucking Doc, huh?

394
00:32:24,387 --> 00:32:29,562
Seeing to the respectable types, leaving us, 
the ones that pay him regular, huh?

395
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:34,858
So that woman and child - Bullock’s?

396
00:32:34,893 --> 00:32:36,657
His wife and son.

397
00:32:36,692 --> 00:32:39,986
Uh, how was Mr. Star?  How was Charlie Utter?

398
00:32:40,021 --> 00:32:41,497
Shut up, Johnny!

399
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,714
Detail Bullock’s condition.

400
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:48,804
The worse for wear.

401
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:53,217
No clarity to his look or focus, as I could cite in other combatants.

402
00:32:53,252 --> 00:32:58,364
You touch me, E.B., I’ll put your nose through your fucking brain!

403
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:02,853
Now, did he state his further intentions?

404
00:33:02,888 --> 00:33:05,241
To have his gun and badge back.

405
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:06,792
In what fucking tone?

406
00:33:06,827 --> 00:33:10,689
Well, I’d shy from putting a name to it, Al.

407
00:33:10,724 --> 00:33:12,241
He was talking to an 8 year-old.

408
00:33:12,276 --> 00:33:14,912
Sound like he’d be coming back for more?

409
00:33:14,947 --> 00:33:17,895
Well, I’d hate to guess and be wrong.

410
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:22,353
New whores on that coach, huh? Find out where they’ll be working.

411
00:33:22,388 --> 00:33:28,064
I could take him his gun and badge, plumb his intent as we talk.

412
00:33:28,099 --> 00:33:31,255
And how would that chat start, E.B., huh?

413
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,560
Here’s your hardware, and as he looks a cunt anyway,

414
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:37,473
Al would like you to have this rose.

415
00:33:37,508 --> 00:33:41,065
I’ll, uh, look into the new whores.

416
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:48,384
How you doing?

417
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:52,864
Uh, is my bullet out?  Will Star live?

418
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:54,352
Well, if he don’t, he’s going happy.

419
00:33:54,387 --> 00:33:58,920
And—and Mr. Utter?  Will he be blind and deaf?

420
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:01,880
No!  Let me suss out that new trim, Johnny,

421
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,760
before I earn some added rebuke.

422
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:13,844
Look, all’s I’m saying is I ain’t your enemy.

423
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:19,177
Well, whatever you thought your intentions was coming on me like you did,

424
00:34:19,212 --> 00:34:23,689
nine times out of 10, that’ll be the last fuckin’ move you ever make.

425
00:34:23,724 --> 00:34:26,129
Bullock will be coming back for his weapon.

426
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:27,416
To what intent?

427
00:34:27,451 --> 00:34:29,480
Open question.

428
00:34:29,515 --> 00:34:31,529
Well, we’ll be ready.

429
00:34:33,728 --> 00:34:35,267
You’ve had your one out of 10.

430
00:34:42,825 --> 00:34:45,659
Cow-eyed kid looking from that coach,

431
00:34:45,694 --> 00:34:47,600
that’s what fucking unmanned me.

432
00:34:57,104 --> 00:34:59,360
He couldn’t have known she was coming.

433
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,200
Just today, I’d asked Mr. Bullock after his family,

434
00:35:06,235 --> 00:35:09,550
and he made no mention of their being en route.

435
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:11,865
You’re kind, extending the hand of welcome.

436
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,624
Well, at it’s best, this camp can be forbidding to new arrivals.

437
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:18,200
Well, that was very much my experience.

438
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:21,135
Let alone to come upon Mr. Bullock in the mud of that thoroughfare,

439
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,520
injured, who knows how seriously?

440
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:28,008
Well, thank goodness he seemed coming back to himself.

441
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:31,847
Miss Isringhausen, I didn’t realize medicine 
was among your areas of expertise.

442
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,801
It isn’t, Mrs. Garret.

443
00:35:35,836 --> 00:35:39,647
Then perhaps I’ll better learn Mr. Bullock’s condition in his presence.

444
00:35:42,887 --> 00:35:45,961
And Mr. Star’s and Utter’s condition.

445
00:35:45,996 --> 00:35:47,191
Yes, ma’am.

446
00:35:47,226 --> 00:35:48,833
Sophia?

447
00:35:52,768 --> 00:35:54,807
You put a ribbon around your candy?

448
00:35:54,842 --> 00:35:58,712
And did you want me to give it to that boy?

449
00:35:58,747 --> 00:36:01,248
Please answer in words, Sophia.

450
00:36:01,283 --> 00:36:02,848
Yes, please.

451
00:36:11,081 --> 00:36:12,672
Miss Isringhausen.

452
00:36:12,707 --> 00:36:13,664
Mr. Ellsworth.

453
00:36:13,699 --> 00:36:16,599
I’m here to steer Mrs. Garret.

454
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:19,896
Then Mr. Ellsworth and I will make the delivery.

455
00:36:33,793 --> 00:36:35,712
Not as I’d been asked, Mrs. Garret,

456
00:36:35,747 --> 00:36:39,888
but I wonder if this ain’t a call better paid another day.

457
00:36:41,055 --> 00:36:45,456
I’ve stopped believing I can dictate the terms of my opportunities.

458
00:36:45,491 --> 00:36:49,392
Well, some would say it might be your choice.

459
00:36:49,427 --> 00:36:57,088
What chances you decide not to take, 
some being the butt-in loudmouth types.

460
00:36:57,123 --> 00:36:59,208
Shall I walk on alone, Mr. Ellsworth?

461
00:36:59,243 --> 00:37:01,376
No, ma’am.

462
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,728
I’m sorry for throwing up.

463
00:37:08,763 --> 00:37:11,776
If you hadn’t, I would suspect your previous habits.

464
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,576
Mr. Bullock.

465
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:23,096
Mrs. Garret.

466
00:37:25,624 --> 00:37:27,537
How are you feeling, Mr. Star?

467
00:37:27,572 --> 00:37:29,515
I’ve puked twice.

468
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,009
Mrs. Garret.

469
00:37:31,044 --> 00:37:32,053
Trixie.

470
00:37:32,088 --> 00:37:33,096
Mrs. Garret.

471
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,248
Mr. Utter.

472
00:37:36,283 --> 00:37:41,119
Ma’am.  Uh, don’t be alarmed.  A lot of this damage is old.

473
00:37:42,368 --> 00:37:44,465
Let me introduce my wife, Martha.

474
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,400
And our son, William.
Mrs. Alma Garret.

475
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:49,903
How do you do?

476
00:37:49,938 --> 00:37:51,200
How do you do?

477
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:52,536
How do you do, William?

478
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:53,751
How do you do?

479
00:37:53,786 --> 00:37:57,111
And Ellsworth, who superintends Mrs. Garret’s claim.

480
00:37:57,146 --> 00:37:59,499
Ma’am.  William.

481
00:37:59,534 --> 00:38:01,016
How do you do?

482
00:38:03,327 --> 00:38:06,119
You’ve discovered us in distressing circumstances.

483
00:38:06,154 --> 00:38:09,824
We’re safe and glad of joining Mr. Bullock.

484
00:38:20,896 --> 00:38:26,384
I hope this can be of some use to you, uh, in your settling in.

485
00:38:26,419 --> 00:38:27,508
Thank you.

486
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,822
Thank you.

487
00:38:29,757 --> 00:38:35,208
My ward included sweets for your son, 
when his mother decides he may have them.

488
00:38:35,243 --> 00:38:36,736
Is your ward a boy?

489
00:38:36,771 --> 00:38:40,907
A girl, Sophia.  A little younger than you, I think.

490
00:38:40,942 --> 00:38:45,599
Oh. Thank you.

491
00:38:52,224 --> 00:38:54,648
You recall Mrs. Garret from my letters.

492
00:39:01,404 --> 00:39:02,368
Yes.

493
00:39:03,804 --> 00:39:05,959
That’s good luck you had right there.

494
00:39:05,994 --> 00:39:11,263
‘Cause I carry the mail, and I’ll admit today before lay people

495
00:39:11,298 --> 00:39:14,743
we lose more letters than we deliver.

496
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,360
I’ll say goodbye then, in hopes that I see you again soon.

497
00:39:29,395 --> 00:39:30,856
Yes.

498
00:39:35,464 --> 00:39:37,544
I hope I see you soon, William.

499
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:39,048
Thanks for the sweets.

500
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:41,961
And don’t be pestering me for the good fishing spots.

501
00:39:41,996 --> 00:39:45,369
I name them only over breakfast at the Grand Central hotel,

502
00:39:45,404 --> 00:39:47,640
or what I call my dog.

503
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,478
Will you see your house?

504
00:39:55,513 --> 00:39:56,814
I would like to very much.

505
00:39:57,798 --> 00:40:02,822
Uh—Ahem—Mrs. Bullock, I –uh, 
I’ve retrieved your bonnet from your former post.

506
00:40:02,857 --> 00:40:06,366
And, uh, at your convenience, the readers of the “Black Hills Pioneer”

507
00:40:06,401 --> 00:40:08,254
would be interested in hearing about your journey

508
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:11,279
and perhaps your first impressions of our camp.

509
00:40:11,314 --> 00:40:13,654
You don’t have to give ‘em all.

510
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:18,239
Thank you for seeing to Mr. Star.

511
00:40:18,274 --> 00:40:20,335
No need to hurry back.

512
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:23,301
Go ahead, William.

513
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:31,670
He never wrote of me in his letters to her…did he?

514
00:40:31,705 --> 00:40:37,583
We never spoke on what he’s wrote to his wife or hadn’t, Mrs. Garret.

515
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,054
Or why he hadn’t

516
00:40:42,303 --> 00:40:47,879
No, Ma’am.  And you and me hadn’t ought to either.

517
00:40:50,285 --> 00:40:53,039
Thank you for taking me, Mr. Ellsworth.

518
00:40:53,074 --> 00:40:54,933
You’re welcome, Ma’am.

519
00:41:02,998 --> 00:41:08,838
You’ll recall…what I wrote about her husband?

520
00:41:10,631 --> 00:41:12,969
How he’d sought his money back on a claim.

521
00:41:13,934 --> 00:41:19,367
He died in a fall before gaining satisfaction,

522
00:41:20,238 --> 00:41:22,719
and the claim proved out rich.

523
00:41:24,722 --> 00:41:27,833
Is that the house, Sir, the splendid one ahead?

524
00:41:27,868 --> 00:41:28,777
It is.

525
00:41:28,812 --> 00:41:32,933
You can walk ahead a little piece, William.  Just a little piece.

526
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:37,473
And of my promise to help the widow…

527
00:41:38,698 --> 00:41:43,248
as I could, made to Wild Bill Hickok.

528
00:41:43,283 --> 00:41:44,382
Yes, Mr. Bullock.

529
00:41:44,417 --> 00:41:49,389
And you must be as weary from the days events and your work readying the house as we are from travel.

530
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:52,579
Please don’t trouble to repeat yourself.

531
00:41:54,737 --> 00:41:56,753
We traveled with that woman and her boy.

532
00:41:56,788 --> 00:41:58,796
While that lady was traveling with you,

533
00:41:58,831 --> 00:42:02,710
her husband the sheriff was pickling his prick in the cunt brine of another.

534
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:09,768
Look at Lila, delivering her ducklings all undamaged and dry.

535
00:42:09,803 --> 00:42:11,624
How are we gonna celebrate, Cy?

536
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:13,856
My vote’s for hardy but brief.

537
00:42:13,891 --> 00:42:15,992
Vote’s don’t count here just yet.

538
00:42:16,027 --> 00:42:18,657
It looks a little small, Lila.

539
00:42:18,692 --> 00:42:22,040
But I guess you gals are used to making the best of that.

540
00:42:24,057 --> 00:42:27,433
Just fleeting as fucking innocence, let me toast to bold new venture.

541
00:42:27,468 --> 00:42:28,705
Your place got a name yet, Honey?

542
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,825
Le Chez Amie.

543
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,402
That’s catchy.

544
00:42:31,437 --> 00:42:34,368
Open your yap, stick out your tongue.

545
00:42:34,403 --> 00:42:37,497
To the Chez Amie!

546
00:42:37,532 --> 00:42:41,897
And to—
stick your fucking tongue out!

547
00:42:41,932 --> 00:42:44,394
Joanie and Maddie!

548
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:47,448
Able hands at a whorehouse tiller!

549
00:42:47,483 --> 00:42:54,032
And to…Doris, one the Bella’s best cocksuckers,

550
00:42:54,067 --> 00:42:57,332
that I send with them as a gesture of friendship.

551
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:59,159
We have the girls we need.

552
00:42:59,194 --> 00:43:00,544
Bon Voyage, sweetheart,

553
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:01,969
as long as we’re speaking french.

554
00:43:02,004 --> 00:43:03,681
We got all the girls we need, Cy.

555
00:43:03,716 --> 00:43:07,425
Ah, don’t fear that she’ll spy, Joanie.

556
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,705
Please, don’t reject Doris on that basis.

557
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,522
You’ll just get her belly cut by me showing you I’m serious.

558
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:15,137
And an uncut Bella whore sent with you.

559
00:43:15,172 --> 00:43:21,033
Being as funds stole from me by Eddie put the Chez Amie on it’s feet,

560
00:43:21,068 --> 00:43:22,440
I consider myself an investor.

561
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,722
And I will have my interests looked at,

562
00:43:24,757 --> 00:43:30,177
60 cents from dollar one! And a true count fucking verified.

563
00:43:30,212 --> 00:43:32,415
All right.
Fine.

564
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,627
Get these girls out of here, Lila!

565
00:43:37,662 --> 00:43:39,145
You better get packed, Doris.

566
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,345
Did you bring anything with you when I bought you?

567
00:43:42,515 --> 00:43:43,681
That’s all right, honey.

568
00:43:43,716 --> 00:43:46,152
You just pack the rags you been wiping the cum off with.

569
00:43:46,187 --> 00:43:47,393
All right, Joanie?

570
00:43:47,428 --> 00:43:49,065
Yes.  And now we’re gonna go.

571
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:53,676
What do you think, I’m a monkey in a zoo?

572
00:43:53,711 --> 00:43:55,456
Think I’m gonna throw my shit after you?

573
00:43:55,491 --> 00:43:57,093
No.

574
00:43:57,128 --> 00:43:59,081
Don’t fucking talk to me like I’m a monkey.

575
00:43:59,116 --> 00:44:01,577
Get those cunts out of here.

576
00:44:03,197 --> 00:44:07,817
Don’t believe there’s no good women 
till you’ve seen one with maggots in her eyes.

577
00:44:10,825 --> 00:44:15,986
Joanie!  Bet the wheel before you leave.  You’re on a lucky run.

578
00:44:25,545 --> 00:44:27,937
Is there fish in this stream?

579
00:44:27,972 --> 00:44:39,145
Sometimes.
This is it.

580
00:44:42,842 --> 00:44:45,577
May we go inside?

581
00:44:45,612 --> 00:44:47,576
Did you get the letter about the house?

582
00:44:47,611 --> 00:44:53,706
I did get that letter.  It’s at the very top of my trunk.

583
00:44:53,741 --> 00:44:55,561
That has all my thoughts.

584
00:44:58,193 --> 00:45:01,248
May we go in?

585
00:45:04,425 --> 00:45:08,976
I should go back now.  You and the boy go in.

586
00:45:12,274 --> 00:45:14,000
Let’s go in the house Mr. Bullock has made us, William.

587
00:45:14,035 --> 00:45:16,849
Come on, Mr. Bullock.

588
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:19,049
Not just now, William.

589
00:45:19,084 --> 00:45:21,034
Don’t you want to come in?

590
00:45:21,069 --> 00:45:25,081
I can’t come in just now.

591
00:45:25,116 --> 00:45:29,195
After you’ve seen to the camp, gotten your gun and badge back?

592
00:45:37,897 --> 00:45:40,288
Well, I’ll take my mother in.

593
00:45:41,676 --> 00:45:43,125
Thank you.

594
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,138
Come on, Mother.

595
00:45:47,173 --> 00:45:50,208
Thank you.

596
00:45:58,581 --> 00:46:02,830
<i>Dear Mrs. Bullock, Your house is near finished.</i>

597
00:46:02,865 --> 00:46:06,432
<i>My satisfaction does not exceed the camp’s lumbermen and sawyers</i>

598
00:46:06,467 --> 00:46:09,526
<i>whose patience I have tried by my over watchful eye</i>

599
00:46:09,561 --> 00:46:13,378
<i>for greenness and for good square edge quality in the cut boards.</i>

600
00:46:13,413 --> 00:46:19,998
<i>I’ve chosen pine, one-year seasoned, for the sills, 
posts, floor joists and rafters.</i>

601
00:46:20,033 --> 00:46:22,861
<i>The other framing timbers is of spruce.</i>

602
00:46:22,896 --> 00:46:25,543
<i>Where partitions bear upon them,</i>

603
00:46:25,578 --> 00:46:27,733
<i>I have doubled the beams and supported the floor</i>

604
00:46:27,768 --> 00:46:30,486
<i>with locus posts set three feet into the ground.</i>

605
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:34,029
<i>I think you may laugh to see the mullioned windows</i>

606
00:46:34,064 --> 00:46:36,503
<i>with their view of the camp from out the parlor.</i>

607
00:46:36,538 --> 00:46:40,333
<i>Being unfinished, they look like unfocused eyes.</i>

608
00:46:40,368 --> 00:46:44,119
<i>I’ve left these and all final decorative choices</i>

609
00:46:44,154 --> 00:46:47,526
<i>to your superior judgment and sensibility.</i>

610
00:46:47,561 --> 00:46:51,798
Soap! Soap with a prize inside!

611
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:55,608
<i>I hope that you and the boy may arrive in good health and safety.</i>

612
00:46:55,643 --> 00:46:59,366
<i>I look forward to our opportunity to better get to know each other.</i>

613
00:46:59,401 --> 00:47:03,094
<i>I pray that in my brother’s stead,</i>

614
00:47:03,129 --> 00:47:06,691
<i>I may be permitted to be a father to the boy </i>

615
00:47:06,726 --> 00:47:11,245
<i>as good as Robert would have been, and as to your care</i>

616
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,359
<i>and comfort and safety, as good a husband to you.</i>

617
00:47:15,394 --> 00:47:20,237
<i>Yours Sincerely, Seth Bullock.</i>
