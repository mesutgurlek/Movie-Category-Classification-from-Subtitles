1
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,519
Dear Janey,

2
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,279
My younger days,
before you was born,

3
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,391
me and Bartle Bone and Jim Ragg

4
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,069
spent time as mule skinners
for General Custer.

5
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,556
We were used to hunting
and trapping in the Rockies,

6
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,309
so we didn't realise taking orders
would be so hard to stomach.

7
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,194
By that time, the silver had run out,
the railroads were coming

8
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,788
and everything was about to change.

9
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,514
But the adventures
weren't quite over yet.

10
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,755
Calam?

11
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,518
- Mule skinners, you say?
- Yes, sir.

12
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,312
Sure you ain't trappers?

13
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,512
Well, we were trappers, 25 years,
but no more.

14
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,632
Rockies all trapped out.
We're scouts, too.

15
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,550
We know every trail, creek, pond,
river between Colorado and Canada.

16
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,591
We hoped Custer would need scouts,

17
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,315
but seeing as those positions
have been filled by Bill Hickok

18
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,079
and a couple of Crow...

19
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,909
Seeing how them positions
done filled, we're mule skinners.

20
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,439
Yeah.

21
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,630
You don't look like much, fella.

22
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,479
Sure you can crack a bullwhip?

23
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,513
Here.

24
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,840
Forward!

25
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,708
In them days, Janey,

26
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,276
there was only two ways
for a woman to survive out West.

27
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,834
Wifing and whoring.

28
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,397
As I weren't cut out for either one,
I had to find my own way to survive.

29
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,071
So I lived like a man and sometimes
even passed myself off as one.

30
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,270
It got a little sticky at times,

31
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,915
but it gave me a kind of freedom
that few women ever knew.

32
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,631
Bill!

33
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,591
Bill Hickok!

34
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,911
Over here!

35
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,390
Well, if it isn't Calamity Jane.

36
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,273
Custer know
he's got a female bullwhacker?

37
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,358
Of course he don't.
Don't you go telling him.

38
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,710
Don't I always keep your secrets?

39
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,037
Where are you going?
You're supposed to be scouting.

40
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,391
I was about to hunt some fresh meat
when you tried to kill me.

41
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,829
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead.

42
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,073
What do you want?

43
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,877
All these years,
I never could quite figure you out.

44
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,790
You never will, Hickok.

45
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,673
Shoot.

46
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,070
Come on, girls.

47
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,793
Bull's-eye!

48
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,876
No beans tonight.

49
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,037
I think it was sickly.
Moving awful slow.

50
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,636
- Hogwash!
- I ain't eating it.

51
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,638
I ain't up to digesting
diseased animal.

52
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,353
Suit yourself.

53
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,230
I'm tired of biting your dust.
Chew on mine for a while.

54
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,318
You're gonna run that wagon
into the river, Calamity.

55
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,637
Better than listening
to you two old ladies arguing.

56
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,117
Who's arguing?
We didn't even draw our knives.

57
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,194
We didn't know it then, Janey,

58
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,392
but them was the last
of the Wild West times,

59
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,637
before everything changed
and Billy Cody made a show of it.

60
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,670
Them last few days of wildness
was our glory days.

61
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,828
Wild Bill Hickok,
Dora and Blue, Jim and Bartle,

62
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,431
Buffalo Bill Cody
and your mother, Calamity Jane.

63
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,196
I always enjoy seeing a lady
in her underwear.

64
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,838
What you packing up for?
We just made camp.

65
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,351
All these years,
I never presumed to give you advice.

66
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,875
But you gotta take Bartle and Jim
and get outta here.

67
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,515
- Why?
- Maybe just cos you know me.

68
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,352
I'm telling you, good time to go.

69
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,198
Thanks, Bill.

70
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,277
- Where are you heading?
- Deadwood.

71
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,838
Howdy, General.

72
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,349
Looks like
we're heading for the Bighorn.

73
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,436
You hoping to find more gold?

74
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,074
- You're dismissed, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

75
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,997
Who told you that, mister?

76
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,795
We're gonna clear out any Indians
that disobey the relocation notice.

77
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,232
Where did you post this notice
and what language was it in?

78
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,511
I don't need your advice, mister.
I have my own scouts.

79
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,432
Yeah, but they ain't Sioux.

80
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,433
This is hunting season.
There's thousands of Sioux.

81
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,949
Do not tell me how to fight Indians.

82
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,233
I took down Black Kettle.

83
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,828
Yeah, we heard about it.

84
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,430
But we're talking
about Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse.

85
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,918
They won't leave the hunting grounds.
You only got 200, 300 men here.

86
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,511
We are the Seventh Cavalry.

87
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,556
- Did you hear that?
- Yep.

88
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,033
Let's get the hell outta here.

89
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,789
I don't remember
who first called me Calamity or why,

90
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,309
but it's no mystery why it stuck.

91
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,194
Your mother don't always think first
before jumping in, Janey.

92
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,232
When Custer found out
I was a woman,

93
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,319
he forced me into doing
damn humiliating woman's work.

94
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,153
Calam!

95
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,111
We're moving out.

96
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,919
I'll catch up with you boys,
soon as I can.

97
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,399
Calamity?

98
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,359
Don't take too long.
That general is crazy.

99
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,198
- He's crazy!
- Let's go.

100
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,389
Jim and Bartle
were among the few left

101
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,988
who remembered
when beaver were plentiful.

102
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,795
They knew every river from
the Oregon Trail to the Rio Grande.

103
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,471
They could never figure out

104
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,149
that what they were searching for,
they'd already used up.

105
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,989
The Indians were dwindling,
the buffalo were gone,

106
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,918
and with them went the life we knew.

107
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,194
This pond
used to be boiling with beaver.

108
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,432
I can still hear it,
sometimes, when I'm asleep.

109
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,078
What?

110
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,111
That sound.

111
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,714
That slapping sound
a beaver's tail makes on the water.

112
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,392
Yeah.

113
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,033
Sometimes I can hear it, too.

114
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,830
There's a time
in the life of every gold town

115
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,794
when it either gets civilised
or goes bust.

116
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,717
Before it makes up its mind which,

117
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,072
men go crazy,
drinking, gambling and whoring.

118
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,159
Cutting into each other's claims
and shooting each other over trifles.

119
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,795
Deadwood just happened to be
in its hellfire days.

120
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,160
Ain't this a sight for sore eyes?

121
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,236
Morning, Harry.

122
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,750
- First one still on the house?
- Only for you, Calam.

123
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,758
I hear you got kicked out the army.

124
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,599
News sure travels fast,
but don't that beat all?

125
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,110
You'd think the damn fools
never saw teats before.

126
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,913
Alright, you debauched sinners,
let's drink to my bosoms.

127
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,554
They got me
out of Custer's Irregulars.

128
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,988
Bless 'em all, large and small.

129
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,757
- Hi, Bill.
- Calam.

130
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,034
Dora!

131
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,994
This woman's spoke for...
You son of a bitch!

132
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,515
Hell. Now she's gonna start
busting out crying.

133
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,593
Jane!

134
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,358
Where have you been?

135
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,191
Hell.

136
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,151
- I've been worried about you.
- I'm gonna find me another bed.

137
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,794
With quieter women in it.

138
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,558
Blue.

139
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,113
You alright?

140
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,711
Will you tell Doosie to make some ham
and some eggs and some biscuits?

141
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,876
Just tell her it's Martha Jane.

142
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,036
Yeah, sure, sweetheart.

143
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,188
Well, you two women, you just...

144
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,231
Get going.

145
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,998
Get out of my bed. You stink!

146
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,677
So are you settling down finally
in Deadwood?

147
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,759
No. It's getting mean here.
You know how it is.

148
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,509
Where you figuring on moving to next?

149
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,632
Someplace closer to Blue's ranch,
I guess.

150
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,272
Why don't you just marry him?

151
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,597
He's asked you a hundred times.

152
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,033
You know I can't do that.

153
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,432
Mercy, Martha Jane! You lose
a hugging contest with a skunk?

154
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,120
You know damn well that ain't skunk,
Doosie.

155
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,835
- It's grizz.
- Yeah. I'll burn these for you.

156
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,556
- There's money in them pockets.
- I'll find it, don't you worry.

157
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,512
Alright, tell me.
What's different about you?

158
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,153
Nothing.

159
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,239
Something's different about you.
You know you can't lie to me.

160
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,198
I ain't lying to you, Dora, am I?

161
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,638
Oh, my God, Martha Jane!

162
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,230
I've known you for 20 years
and this has never happened to you.

163
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,432
- Nothing's happened to me.
- You are in love.

164
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,116
Oh, God.

165
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,271
What's the point?

166
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,351
I'd rather die than have him know it.

167
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,953
- It's Hickok, isn't it?
- No! Don't say that name!

168
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,868
James Butler Hickok. Wild Bill.

169
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,515
- Let me think.
- No, Dora, don't start thinking.

170
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,437
It's a long way from hopeless.

171
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,916
He don't like prissies and he
don't even like whores that much,

172
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,156
but we're gonna get him to like you.

173
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,197
I don't want him to like me.
I just wanna die!

174
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,995
It's a serious condition, darling,
but it ain't fatal.

175
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,590
Here. Get out of that tub.
We've got work to do.

176
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,072
There.

177
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,790
Open your eyes.

178
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,237
Sweet Jesus!

179
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,237
Here, stand up.

180
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,110
You see? Aren't you beautiful?

181
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,869
I don't look anything like myself.

182
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,675
Yes, you do.
You look exactly like yourself.

183
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,552
Think he's gonna like me?

184
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,753
Every man in that place is gonna
want you so bad, it's gonna hurt.

185
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,998
I guaran-damn-tee it.
Now, walk like this, alright?

186
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,112
Yeah, like that.

187
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,320
That son of a bitch ain't even here.

188
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,594
- Two whiskeys with water, Harry.
- Water?

189
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,235
You want to stay in charge,
you drink half of what they drink.

190
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,316
I'll get it, ladies.

191
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,035
You've been holding out on the world,
Martha Jane.

192
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,193
Hello, boys!

193
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,315
Everybody! Boys!

194
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,750
Listen up. This here's Martha.

195
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,270
Now, dancing only,
and we'll be watching you.

196
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,719
Damn!

197
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,679
Keep back there.

198
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,839
If these halfwits can do it,
you sure as hell can.

199
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,275
Come on, Jesse. Your turn.

200
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,114
That's more like it.

201
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,955
See? You can dance.

202
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,436
That ain't dancing.
That's grizzly wrestling.

203
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,156
Oh, my God!

204
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,678
There he is.

205
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,394
Go on over there
and see how the game's going.

206
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,873
I can't.

207
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,070
Want to do
another round of grizzlies?

208
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,236
- No.
- No. Come on.

209
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,593
Come on.

210
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,956
Come here, darling. Have a seat.

211
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,957
Come meet a lucky charm.

212
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,470
You sure are charming.

213
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,112
Do you know who I am?

214
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,994
Sweetheart, I'm James Butler Hickok.

215
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,190
I've scouted for the best.

216
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,154
My senses are as keen
as any white man's you've ever known.

217
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,234
Have we met before?

218
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,590
You ain't fooling me, darling.

219
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,914
Of course we have.

220
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,993
What's my name?

221
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,551
Lily.

222
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,151
At least it ought to be Lily.

223
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,193
It'd suit you a whole lot better
in this get-up

224
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,118
than a name like Calamity Jane.

225
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,718
Lily.

226
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,955
Or Rose.

227
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,516
Please don't let on who I am.

228
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,473
Darling, I'm the soul of discretion.

229
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,276
Bill, you're the soul
of a black-hearted liar.

230
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,271
Boys.

231
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,356
Guess who I got sitting on my knee.

232
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,438
It's Calamity Jane.

233
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,875
- Blue.
- She'll be alright.

234
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,912
No, she won't.
Not out there, not dressed like that.

235
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,713
This is Calamity.
She can take care of herself.

236
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,831
She'll be back.

237
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,952
No, she won't. Not to Deadwood.

238
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,397
Don't cry, darling.

239
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,151
Don't cry.

240
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,553
It's OK, Lily.

241
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,671
It's Jane.

242
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,835
Yeah, of course it is.

243
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,517
That'd be real sweet.

244
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,273
Darling Martha Jane.

245
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,316
I cannot sleep with you worrying.

246
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,989
I can't help worrying, Blue.
It's all my fault.

247
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,635
I never should have gotten her
all gussied up.

248
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,550
Bill Hickok is a son of a bitch.

249
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,989
He sure is.

250
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,116
There have been times in my life
I might not have made it

251
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,276
if it wasn't for Jane.

252
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,994
Yeah, you done the same for her.

253
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,350
I've seen it myself. Lots of times.

254
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:22,710
I know. It makes me sad that
no man has ever loved her, you know?

255
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,748
Something they could never say
about you.

256
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,035
When you gonna marry me, Dora?

257
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,873
I gotta get back to my ranch.

258
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,958
Come with me.

259
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,672
I can't.

260
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,109
I love you, Blue.

261
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,198
You know how much I love you.

262
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,436
But I can't marry you.

263
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,509
You better quit saying that,
cos one day I might quit asking.

264
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,075
I am thinking
about moving closer, though.

265
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,311
You know?

266
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,475
Maybe opening a hotel in Miles City.

267
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,630
You are a stubborn old catfish.

268
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,760
But I'm gonna reel you in
a few miles at a time...

269
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,555
...till eventually
I land you as my wife.

270
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,832
No Ears.

271
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,438
You got any dry wood?

272
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,915
I would have brought some
but I didn't know anybody was here.

273
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,828
Where you been?
I ain't seen you in over a month.

274
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,639
I wanted to see if any of my people
were left in the Dakotas.

275
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,436
- Any luck finding them?
- A few are there.

276
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,312
But only their spirits.

277
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,236
You should not go this way.

278
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,749
I came to tell you this.

279
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,873
I'm headed for the Yellowstone.
I always go this way.

280
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,876
Go another way.

281
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,277
Why?

282
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,193
Smell of death. Maybe 50 miles.

283
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,159
Well, I ain't going 50 miles out
of my way. I ain't spooked by death.

284
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,474
I nursed the miners in Deadwood
through scarlet fever.

285
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,434
40 of them died.
There ain't nothing worse than that.

286
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,831
Your dog's sure lived long
for one who likes to chase bears.

287
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,393
So have you and so have I.

288
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,952
Want some coffee, No Ears?

289
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:23,554
When No Ears was ten, his people
got into a fight with French traders.

290
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,513
He woke to discover
his people were dead

291
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,790
and his ears were cut off.

292
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,673
He could still hear
in a whistling kind of way.

293
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,872
He could always sense things
no one else could.

294
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,150
Especially death.

295
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,590
It was Custer.

296
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,830
I saw the flag.

297
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,390
- We should tell somebody.
- Why?

298
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,993
Was that massacre back there...

299
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,149
Was that like the one where they cut
off your ears and left you for dead?

300
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,430
I was just a child.

301
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,154
But all massacres are alike.

302
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,075
The smell of death.

303
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,638
The big birds
to pick the bones clean.

304
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,110
But then,
there were only Indian dead.

305
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,229
And only me to sing for them.

306
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,552
I must have eaten something bad
this morning.

307
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,310
I usually got a stronger stomach
than that.

308
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,514
It is because of the child.

309
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,838
Child?

310
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,791
I didn't see no child.

311
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,358
The one you're carrying.

312
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,637
You're crazy.

313
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,318
That's impossible.

314
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,477
I might be crazy,
but you know it is possible.

315
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,192
But that can't be.

316
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,277
I mean, I can't.

317
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,076
I can't have a child.

318
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,790
You will, in the spring.

319
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,236
God Almighty!

320
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,918
I can't be nobody's mother.
I got no place to live.

321
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,234
What am I gonna do?

322
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,155
If you need a place to go before
the child comes, I know of one.

323
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,555
How will I live?

324
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,318
You will live.

325
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,151
You always seem
to be looking out for me, No Ears.

326
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,274
Why is that?

327
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,755
These fish are ready.
Come and have some.

328
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,635
Where is this place...
where I can hole up?

329
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,832
The Wind River,
about four days' ride.

330
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,710
Thanks, No Ears.

331
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,669
- Mind that china, now.
- Here, Doosie.

332
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,629
- Well, Madame Dora.
- I'm not French, Hickok.

333
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,231
- You're not?
- No.

334
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,632
Next thing you'll be telling me
you're not a madam neither.

335
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,834
Men like you are the reason
that I'm leaving this town.

336
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,835
I'm sorry to hear that.

337
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,076
It'll be our loss.

338
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,757
I never really thought of myself
as a woman, Janey.

339
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,237
I guess that's why I didn't feel
like myself when I was carrying you.

340
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,638
I was with Dora when she had
her babies. None of them lived.

341
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,916
Though a part of me never really let
myself believe that you'd be real.

342
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,319
Without her babies
to hold her in place,

343
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,556
Dora had a restlessness inside her

344
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,753
that kept her moving from one hotel
to the next, one town to another.

345
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,634
She could never find any peace
except when she was with Blue.

346
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,797
But I stayed put all those months,
holed up,

347
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,150
waiting for you to come.

348
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,838
I never knew what it was
to be loved by a man, Janey.

349
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,316
That's just a plain fact.
I ain't saying it for pity.

350
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,036
But because of your daddy,
I know what it is to love one.

351
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,391
I want you to know that you were born
out of as good a love

352
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,080
as anybody gets born from, honey.

353
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,395
Don't you ever forget that.

354
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,798
The smell of death is strong.
Even you must smell it.

355
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,469
Gunpowder, kerosene and piss.
That's all I smell.

356
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,233
- There, see?
- Whoever he is, he's no grief to me.

357
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,314
- Who was that they hanged?
- Jack McCall.

358
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,399
- What did they hang him for?
- Killing Wild Bill Hickok.

359
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,149
Well done!

360
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,350
He killed my friend!

361
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,957
- He killed my friend!
- Don't shoot me.

362
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,991
Where's Dora?

363
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,429
I'll be with you in just a moment.

364
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,110
Where's Dora DuFran?

365
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,318
She's gone.

366
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,274
She sold out and moved away
six months ago.

367
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,592
Excuse me.
May I speak to you for a moment?

368
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,075
Whatever you're selling,
I ain't buying.

369
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,795
I'm not selling anything.
I'd just like to talk to you.

370
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,070
Please. Just for a moment.

371
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,790
Is this your child?

372
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,798
- What of it?
- May I ask where the father is?

373
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,114
Murdered.

374
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,230
If I'd got here sooner, I'd have
cut the liver out of Jack McCall

375
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,035
and hung it on a tree, Indian-style.

376
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,436
Did your husband
leave you sufficient means?

377
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,518
No, he did not,
and he weren't my husband.

378
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,108
I can see
you're in a terrible predicament.

379
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,916
My name is O'Neill.

380
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,156
Captain James O'Neill.

381
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,232
My wife and I
lost a child a short time ago.

382
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,719
A baby girl.

383
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,919
That's why we came out here.

384
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,318
I thought a journey out West might
distract my wife from her grief.

385
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,036
- Where are you from?
- I'm from England originally.

386
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,197
But we live in Illinois now,
near Mary's family.

387
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,433
Illinois.

388
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,958
It's been a terribly difficult time
for my wife.

389
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,675
Well, it's been a terribly difficult
time for both of us.

390
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,835
We can't have any more children.

391
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,270
It might kill her.

392
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,875
Her name's Janey.

393
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,911
She's beautiful.

394
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,309
It's time to go.

395
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,078
We'll take good care of her.

396
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,392
You have a daughter.

397
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,239
A beautiful baby girl.

398
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,672
I loved you, you son of a bitch.

399
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,639
Dear Janey,

400
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,878
It's been more than five years now
since your daddy was killed.

401
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,719
I miss him and I miss you.

402
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,080
I know now
that the way I felt about Wild Bill

403
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,953
only happens to a person
once in their life.

404
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,116
Like Dora and Blue.

405
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,196
It's the same kind of love.

406
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,470
They just don't know
what to do with it.

407
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,388
Thou would still be adored

408
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,832
As this moment thou art

409
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,592
Let thy loveliness fade as it will

410
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,189
And around the dear ruin

411
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,551
Each wish of my heart

412
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:25,756
Would entwine itself verdantly still

413
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,713
It's so good to see you again.

414
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,793
I...

415
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,391
I came to tell you
that the house is finished.

416
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,079
It's beautiful.
I want you to come out and see it.

417
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,430
We can leave
first thing in the morning.

418
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,039
I can't.

419
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,392
Why not?

420
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,228
I don't understand you, Dora.
Why won't you come and look at it?

421
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,671
Because I'd probably love it
and that would make it even harder.

422
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,598
Tell me why you won't marry me
and I'll quit asking.

423
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,800
If you love me like you say you do...

424
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,036
- I do.
- Then why?

425
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,631
You like a town? A ranch ain't
lively enough for you? Is that it?

426
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,909
No.

427
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,715
I didn't build that ranch out there
out of nothing

428
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,718
just to live out there by myself
with no wife and...

429
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,911
...and no children.

430
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,470
I apologise, Dora.

431
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,394
I love you. I always will.

432
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,069
I'm asking you for the last time,
Dora.

433
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,356
Will you marry me?

434
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,237
I can't.

435
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,789
I love you more than anything.

436
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,513
But I can't marry you.

437
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,639
Cody, looks like we're gonna
get us a hot supper tonight.

438
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,357
- Blue.
- Martha Jane.

439
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,198
How you doing?

440
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,993
What are you doing here?

441
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:45,352
I was passing through and I thought
I might grab a bed for the night.

442
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,630
I didn't know
you was having a shindig.

443
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,115
- Well...
- Who's getting married?

444
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,709
- Come and dance.
- I don't dance.

445
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,035
Sure you do. Come on.

446
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,148
Ain't the bride
Granville Stuart's daughter?

447
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,434
I thought she was still a kid.

448
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:17,519
No, she's 18... 19.

449
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,279
Which one of your cowboys
is marrying her?

450
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,996
The one you're dancing with.

451
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,633
- The hell you say!
- Well, it's true.

452
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,833
You son of a bitch!

453
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,190
Simmer down, Martha Jane.

454
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,998
Simmer down?

455
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,829
You jilted the best friend I ever
had. Does Dora know about this?

456
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,754
Couldn't you tell her? Before
she finds out from somebody else.

457
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,712
You tell her yourself on your way
straight to hell, Teddy Blue!

458
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,196
I ain't doing your dirty work
or dancing at your goddamn wedding.

459
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,719
Martha Jane!

460
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,590
Martha Jane, you quit that!

461
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,631
Get up!

462
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,038
Now, sit down!

463
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,718
OK. Everybody, back inside.

464
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,273
It's over.

465
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,198
Plenty to eat and drink
and music and everything.

466
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,232
Just go on in, enjoy yourselves.

467
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,918
It's all over.

468
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,195
I never thought you'd turn out
to be a son of a bitch, Blue.

469
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,436
I'll tell you something.
See this porch?

470
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,870
I built this porch with my hands.
For Dora.

471
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,073
And a bathroom big enough to hold
that copper tub she loves so much.

472
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:04,478
And a kitchen where Doosie would
think she'd died and gone to heaven.

473
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,516
But Dora never even came
to look at it.

474
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,274
And every time I look at it,
I know she's never gonna be here

475
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,231
to welcome me home.

476
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,638
I guess I just got tired of hoping,
that's all.

477
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,671
Well, what am I gonna tell her?

478
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,998
You just tell her that...
nothing's changed.

479
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,678
I will. But it ain't true.

480
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,556
If you were in love with him
and he married somebody else,

481
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,398
would I go to his wedding?

482
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,273
I didn't plan it that way.
It just kinda happened.

483
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,551
Well, no true friend of mine
would have gone.

484
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,478
Why didn't you speak up
when the preacher said,

485
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,797
"Does anybody see a reason
why these two shouldn't be married?"

486
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,070
I sort of missed that part.

487
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,555
I can't believe he did this!

488
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,717
You could have been the bride.
He asked you plenty of times.

489
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,273
Now you're taking his side!

490
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,278
I am not taking his side.
God Almighty, Dora!

491
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,995
Blue let you down. I didn't. If you
can't see that, the hell with you!

492
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,874
Where's my hat?

493
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,470
Howdy, folks.
Come along to the show, kids.

494
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,638
How do you do?

495
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,360
Come along to the show, folks.

496
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,711
It's Calamity Jane.

497
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,274
That's the woman
I've come here to see.

498
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,794
I ain't in the mood for
your fancy jaw-flapping, Billy Cody.

499
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,795
Martha Jane,
I've travelled 1,000 miles

500
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,718
and gone to considerable expense
to find you,

501
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,876
to make you a star in my show.

502
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,754
Billy, I got a real itch
to shoot somebody this morning.

503
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,519
As an old friend,
I advise you to stay out of my way.

504
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,315
Think about it. We'll play
for the crowned heads of England.

505
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,637
I'm gonna put your name
on the poster, and your face.

506
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,637
Yeah, I can see it now.

507
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,035
Calamity Jane, half man, half woman.

508
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,197
Right between the dog boy
and the two-headed rattlesnake.

509
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,392
- No goddamn thank you.
- You can insult me if you want to.

510
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,478
I'm trying
but it don't seem to be taking.

511
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,160
Damn fool sideshow.

512
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,991
- Dora.
- Billy.

513
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,031
Look at you!

514
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,470
- These are for you.
- Fiddlesticks!

515
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:03,479
Dora ain't no child.
She can't be bought with this stuff.

516
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:07,639
Doosie, if you appreciated presents,
you might get some.

517
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,751
You made an impression
on Doc Ramses.

518
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,555
Doc Ramses? He ain't big enough
for me, Bill Cody.

519
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,671
And neither are you.

520
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,635
Billy! It's beautiful.

521
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,228
How did you know
I would be my same size?

522
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,237
Dora, if you lost your figure,

523
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,079
half the men in the West
would give up and get married.

524
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,158
Look at you. You already did give up
and get married.

525
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,589
How is Lulu anyway?

526
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,711
That was a mistake.

527
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,831
I should have married you, Dora.

528
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,512
What brings you to Montana?

529
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,108
I'm recruiting talent
for my Wild West show.

530
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,754
We're playing
Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.

531
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,359
Don't that take the cake!

532
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,870
Sure. I got Annie Oakley,
cowboys, Indians.

533
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,560
Hell, I got Sitting Bull himself
signed up.

534
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,398
Have you gone crazy?

535
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,034
The Indian wars are over in Missouri
but not here.

536
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,832
I can deal with Sitting Bull.

537
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,599
I want you to come to Europe
with me. You'll love it.

538
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,156
I... Do you want cream or lemon
with your tea?

539
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,599
The hell with tea!
Open your presents, Dora.

540
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,631
I got French champagne in here.

541
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,311
Billy, it's beautiful!

542
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,194
Dora, in my life,
I've met hundreds of women.

543
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,629
A lot of them rich and beautiful.

544
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,673
But every night when I blow out
my light, yours is the face I see.

545
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,951
We both know that I got rich
telling whoppers.

546
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,277
But them's the truest words
I've ever said in this life.

547
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,955
Are you gonna open that champagne?

548
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,113
Dora!

549
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,433
I dare say
we're not too hard to track any more.

550
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,553
Probably left a trail of tobacco spit
any citified dude could follow.

551
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,316
This was once a lively town.

552
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:27,150
Ten years ago,
there were two saloons up there.

553
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,749
You know,
we could have our own town.

554
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,872
No Ears could be the mayor.

555
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,112
I'll be the judge.

556
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,755
You can be the sheriff and
arrest anybody that comes to town.

557
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,835
Perfect.

558
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,679
We could charge big fines
for trespassing

559
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,314
or for spitting on the street.

560
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,398
It could beat beavering
as a way to get rich.

561
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,317
What's gonna draw people?

562
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,749
Your good looks
or my sunny disposition?

563
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,038
Darling Janey,

564
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,355
This bitter cold is something.

565
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,358
I had to put the ink
in the coffee pot to thaw it.

566
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,198
It was froze solid.

567
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:34,074
But I have to write these letters
so you'll know a little bit about me,

568
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,191
for I could someday
get ate by a bear,

569
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,278
get my head stove in
by some tough.

570
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,879
Someone who runs loose like I do
can get killed pretty quick.

571
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,037
A sweet little girl like you
shouldn't read this stuff.

572
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,515
But someday, when you're grown,

573
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,155
I hope you can read these letters
and know something of your mother.

574
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,236
Martha Jane.

575
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,598
Damn it to hell!

576
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,837
- What?
- What are we doing?

577
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,714
Sleeping. What's got you so itchy?

578
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,513
Looking at your sourpusses,
that's what.

579
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,712
You look like you belong
in a hospital, both of you.

580
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,149
One that keeps an undertaker handy.

581
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:18,990
You ain't one to be criticising
other people's appearances, Calam.

582
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,237
I know. I look no better myself.

583
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,112
Probably worse.

584
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,472
We got no business spending our lives
wandering round sleeping in the snow.

585
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,238
Nice catch, No Ears.

586
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,510
We ain't kids no more.

587
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,633
There ain't no more beaver.
There ain't no dry firewood.

588
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,910
There's just three fools
and an Indian.

589
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,713
The Indian's only in it
for the company.

590
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:45,549
Except for Jim, none of us
can hit a squirrel in broad daylight

591
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,275
unless he stands ten feet
in front of us and says "cheese".

592
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,868
You don't usually complain.

593
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,558
Nobody's gonna appreciate it
if you throw a fit.

594
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,353
My point is that Billy Cody's right.

595
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,358
The big adventure's over
and that's that.

596
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,040
He's right to make a show of it
and sell it.

597
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,515
I should have thought
of a Wild West show.

598
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,952
I got to the West
a long time before Billy.

599
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,470
You ain't planning on
joining Billy's spectacle, are you?

600
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,194
No, I ain't.
Not for a million dollars.

601
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,914
Where are you going?
You ain't had breakfast yet.

602
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,679
I'm going nowhere.
I got nowhere left to go.

603
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,951
But if you're smart, you'll stop
sleeping in the damn snow.

604
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,640
One morning,
you'll wake up frozen to death.

605
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,839
There's a white wind coming.

606
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,511
You stay. I will go after her.

607
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,358
A white wind
is a particular kind of blizzard.

608
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,675
One that confuses everything.

609
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,679
Even the best scouts refuse to move
in a white wind.

610
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,075
And I should have known better.

611
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,399
Skeedle! Get two blankets
and some whiskey.

612
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,349
Martha Jane,
I'm sorry for the things I said.

613
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,199
I didn't mean them.
You're my best friend.

614
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,197
It's OK. You're safe. You're home.

615
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,390
You're gonna be alright.

616
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,150
Bless your heart!

617
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,273
Tee, come put Satan in the barn.

618
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:51,670
If things don't improve, I'm gonna
have to entertain customers myself.

619
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,756
The more we make,
the more we spend.

620
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,393
We never get out of the hole.

621
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,159
We might
if we quit relocating all the time.

622
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,350
How's this?

623
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,391
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

624
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,953
Oh, God.

625
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,355
What were you fools doing
out in the blizzard?

626
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,311
We was looking for you, that's what.

627
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,353
That's very nice of you,
but don't be so stupid next time.

628
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,948
I'll see about
getting you guys a couple of beds.

629
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:23,198
Don't be getting any ideas
about the girls. This is business.

630
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,278
Yes, ma'am. I mean, no, ma'am. Dora.

631
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,118
Thanks, Doos.

632
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,872
I thought I saw you beaver boys
sneaking in the back door.

633
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,480
- Jane. Doosie.
- How you doing, Billy?

634
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,114
I brought you something
to get the chill off.

635
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,071
Thank you, Billy.

636
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,158
- This here is Doc Ramses.
- Gentlemen.

637
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,033
- Helping me get my show together.
- Much obliged, Bill.

638
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,196
So what are you boys doing?

639
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,197
Trapping beavers or what?

640
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,550
Mostly "or what".
The beavers are all gone.

641
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,830
Old Jim, he's reluctant to admit it.

642
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,190
I know how you feel, Jim Ragg.

643
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,550
I feel the same way
about the buffalo.

644
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,319
But there's no sense
grieving interminably.

645
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,431
I got a better proposition.

646
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,915
I want you to join
my illustrious company.

647
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:13,828
- I'm gonna make you heroes.
- We ain't no heroes.

648
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,030
We ain't even in the army any more.

649
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,799
You got to think
of the younger generation, Bartle.

650
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,911
The plains is filling up with towns.

651
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,828
Soon, the only way to see riding and
shooting will be in a Wild West show.

652
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,918
Yeah. You are partly to blame, Billy.

653
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,559
You were the one
who made a name killing buffalo.

654
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,433
Next thing we knew,
they was all gone.

655
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,710
And the Indians
was too starved to fight.

656
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,070
Now, if we had just
kept those buffalo,

657
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:44,637
I believe this whole business
would have lasted my lifetime.

658
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,910
Bartle, that is something
I regret myself.

659
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,395
I'm buying buffalo,
trying to bring 'em back.

660
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,909
I got over 100 head
grazing on my ranch.

661
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:56,272
- You're buying buffalo?
- Every one I see, Jim.

662
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,994
The way I see you boys
is as Lewis and Clark.

663
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,998
It was their expedition
that started the West.

664
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,031
- You'd be my stars.
- Yeah.

665
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:10,349
I'm sorry, Billy, but me and Jim
would rather spit on the flag

666
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,789
than make a mockery out of ourselves.

667
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,992
- Is there money in it?
- Money?

668
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,395
Lt'd make you prosperous, Jim.

669
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,796
I would go further.
I'd say it's gonna make you rich.

670
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,673
Well, I am happy to say

671
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:29,952
that we cannot be bought
for 30 pieces of silver.

672
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,674
I can. I'm gonna be in it.

673
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,875
Well, more than three people
in a room,

674
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,958
you clam up like a dummy.

675
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,799
There's gonna be
hundreds of people watching.

676
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,592
- Thousands.
- Thousands?

677
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,554
- Do I have to talk?
- No.

678
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:53,111
- Then I'm in.
- Good, Jim. Welcome aboard.

679
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,037
Now, Bartle, what about you?

680
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,832
- No.
- Bartle!

681
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,235
Lewis and Clark
ain't no heroes of mine.

682
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:05,272
Any jackass could walk to Oregon.

683
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,719
Don't be so stubborn.

684
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,152
Who do you wanna play? Geronimo?

685
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:16,629
You... bull!

686
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,279
Cody!

687
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,798
There you are, you old prodigal, you.

688
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,834
You planning to murder me
for my valuables?

689
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,837
You got that look in your eye.

690
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:45,191
I just can't figure out
what could have possessed you

691
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,356
to want to be part of the circus.

692
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,358
- I need the money.
- What do you need money for?

693
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,358
You can't stand to sleep
with a roof over your head.

694
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,554
I got an inspiration.

695
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,877
When Billy started talking
about buffalo,

696
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,438
I figured if you can buy buffalo,
why not beaver?

697
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:10,518
Buy beaver? Where on earth
you gonna buy beaver?

698
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,796
I don't know.

699
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,078
Somewheres.

700
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,796
I figured if we bought a few pairs

701
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,354
and let 'em loose
up in the high creeks,

702
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:27,350
they could procreate and proliferate
and be plentiful again.

703
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,878
Is that why you joined up with Billy?

704
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,231
Yep. I don't know why
you're so cantankerous about it.

705
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,715
You been wanting
to join up all along.

706
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,193
Old bull!

707
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,153
Are you gonna be Lewis
and I'll be Clark or what?

708
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:48,273
- I'll be Lewis. You be Clark.
- No, I'm gonna be Lewis.

709
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,152
Martha Jane.

710
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,228
- Get me a beer.
- The hell with that.

711
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,476
Drink whiskey with me.

712
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:14,309
You know I'm a reformed man,
Martha Jane.

713
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:20,549
Don't tell me your child bride
made you change your foolish ways.

714
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:24,036
I'm too old to start drinking whiskey
at ten in the morning.

715
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,072
Yeah, well, I'm too old to stop.

716
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,838
Dora, she...

717
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:38,799
She ain't hurrying down this morning.

718
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,353
Listen, Blue.

719
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,995
She threw a mad-dog tantrum at me
just for going to your wedding.

720
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,475
Figure out how mad she is at you.

721
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,831
I wish she wouldn't take it so hard.

722
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,830
Well, if it's not T Blue.

723
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:01,428
- What a surprise.
- Billy.

724
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,993
Whiskey, Tee.

725
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,111
You look prosperous.

726
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,754
Circus life
must be agreeing with you.

727
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,314
What did Bartle and Jim say?

728
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,831
Jim's in.

729
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,195
Well, if you ain't got Bartle,
you ain't got Jim.

730
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,470
What about you, Calamity?

731
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,637
You reconsider my offer?
You're an original.

732
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:26,275
Well, Billy,
my reputation's all I got.

733
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,311
And it ain't for sale.

734
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,673
How about you, Blue?

735
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:36,150
I reckon you're still
the best rider and roper around.

736
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:39,192
Even if you're looking
a little over the hill.

737
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,231
Sure, Billy.

738
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,635
Next time there's a blizzard in hell.

739
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,552
Doosie!

740
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,910
You're looking...
You're looking good.

741
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:55,079
You're looking better than a skunk
like you has any business looking.

742
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,351
You got a message for me?

743
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,072
I got a message alright.

744
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,273
Yeah?

745
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,994
She's expecting Mr Cody
in her sitting room.

746
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,231
If you both will excuse me. Calamity.

747
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,112
Blue, nice to see you.

748
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,196
I'm coming, Dora.

749
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:21,836
Tee, give me a whiskey.

750
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,550
And give one to Martha Jane.

751
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:27,399
Now, Blue, don't get all crazy.

752
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,670
I'm 40 years old, Martha Jane.

753
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,552
More, probably.

754
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:36,390
And, unfortunately, I don't shoot
people for that stuff any more.

755
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,035
You hurt her real bad.

756
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,196
You know she don't care about Billy.

757
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,515
But it's better than crying over you.

758
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,870
You've been my friend a long time,
Blue.

759
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,798
If you feel lower than scum
at the bottom of a pond,

760
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,592
you got it coming.

761
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,151
Tee, give me a bottle.

762
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,391
Hell, Blue.

763
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,398
You still don't understand
why Dora wouldn't marry you.

764
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,830
No, and I don't suppose I ever will.

765
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,838
When Dora was small,
she grew up in a farm in Kansas.

766
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,308
They could barely scratch a living.

767
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,829
When the war came,
soldiers stole the livestock.

768
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,510
When the sickness came,
they fell to it.

769
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,591
Dora's sisters died. And her mother.

770
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:45,792
- The boys just run off.
- I never knew that.

771
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,275
Finally, it was just Dora
and her father.

772
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,236
She was 11 when he died.

773
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:57,957
She walked to Abilene. All the way,
barefoot, thin as a twig.

774
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:02,039
She never forgot the feeling of being
hungry and watching everybody die.

775
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,031
She's scared to death
to live out on a farm, Blue.

776
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:09,038
Afraid you'd go off
and something might happen to you.

777
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,757
Afraid she'd starve.

778
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,236
I wouldn't have let her starve.

779
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:18,238
I'd have built a barn full of beef
to make her happy.

780
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,677
I know that, Blue.

781
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,791
But you can't talk
to fear like Dora's.

782
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,592
Why didn't she tell me?

783
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,596
She was afraid if you knew,

784
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,518
you might have moved to town
to marry her.

785
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:34,154
And that
would have killed your spirit.

786
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:38,392
And seeing that
would have killed Dora.

787
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:56,878
Thanks. Thanks for telling me that,
Martha Jane.

788
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:03,433
Take care, Blue.

789
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,838
- Goodnight, Billy.
- Dora.

790
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,912
Blue, what are you doing?

791
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,759
I'm scaling your castle walls,
darling.

792
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,440
You're gonna get yourself killed,
you fool.

793
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:03,872
It will be an honour to die for you,
Dora.

794
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,389
Blue.

795
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,679
Stand back, darling. I'm coming in.

796
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,712
Blue!

797
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,509
Blue, tell me you're not dead.

798
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,237
Dora?

799
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,393
Martha...

800
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,834
Martha Jane told me...

801
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,678
Told you what?

802
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,593
Why you wouldn't marry me.

803
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,113
Why didn't you tell me?

804
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,754
I never would have married anybody.

805
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,032
I'd have learned to live in town.

806
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:21,311
No, you've got to live
out on your ranch

807
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,749
on the land, under the sky.

808
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:25,359
That's who you are, Blue.

809
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:27,914
But I would have done it for you,
Dora.

810
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,558
But it's too late.

811
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,592
I know.

812
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,116
What are we going to do, Dora?

813
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,116
The best that we can.

814
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,473
We'll just do the best that we can.

815
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,993
Can you believe Bartle's going,
No Ears?

816
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:17,476
Mr Cody has invited me to join him
on this great journey as well.

817
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,636
You ain't going, are you?

818
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,512
I would like to see this water
they speak of.

819
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,791
They say it's so vast
you can't see the far bank.

820
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,036
What's the use of all that water?

821
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:32,754
You can't drink it
or water crops with it.

822
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:37,630
A prairie of water you can't drink?

823
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,513
No. Salt.

824
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,676
Do fish live in it?

825
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,839
Yep. Some of them
are as big as a house.

826
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:53,676
These fish are as big as the boat?

827
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,234
Yeah. Some bigger.

828
01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:00,277
Maybe we should
ride around this water.

829
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,358
You can't. The ocean goes
to the top of the world.

830
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:08,993
I would like to know more
about this ocean.

831
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:13,468
It's because people fail to gather
precise information

832
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,511
about life-threatening matters

833
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:19,269
that many of them
are no longer alive.

834
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:24,348
So you're set on going, then?

835
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,950
I must see this water
and these great fish

836
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:31,514
and bring the knowledge
back to my people.

837
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,876
Don't forget to get me something.

838
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,072
- I reckon we're about to leave.
- Yeah?

839
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:47,399
- That's a fine slicker, No Ears.
- Check up on that paint pony.

840
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,838
Miss Dora.

841
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:56,032
Will you tell me all about the Queen
when you come back?

842
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,709
I sure wish you were coming with us,
Dora. I deeply wish it.

843
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:04,951
You show 'em.
Show 'em how wild the West really is.

844
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,037
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

845
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,149
Bye, Dora.

846
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:30,231
You should have come, Calamity.

847
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:33,511
- I was gonna make you famous.
- I am famous.

848
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:37,349
I can't stomach all this silly
hanky waving. Get outta here.

849
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:40,199
- Bye, Calam.
- So long, y'all.

850
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,798
They hadn't been gone a week

851
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:16,833
when I got the letter that
the woman I gave you to had died.

852
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,996
My heart ached for you, sweetheart.

853
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:22,271
I wanted so bad
for you to know you had a mother.

854
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,834
A mother who loves you.

855
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,312
The captain said
he'd taken you home to England.

856
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:32,273
Don't that beat all? England.

857
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,392
Right where my partners
were headed without me.

858
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:43,711
Why didn't you tell me?
I could have helped you.

859
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,998
Damn it to hell, Dora.

860
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:53,751
This letter's been to hell and back.
It's almost a year old.

861
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,111
I should have gone with Billy.

862
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,992
Maybe you can catch up to them.

863
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,717
You have to try.

864
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,752
She needs a mother
and she's got one.

865
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:10,233
A broken-down old bullwhacker's
better than no mother at all.

866
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,237
You'll be a wonderful mother.

867
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:16,512
You can bring her back here
and we can all live together.

868
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,710
I thought it was best for her, Dora.

869
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,559
There ain't a day gone by
I ain't regretted it.

870
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,388
You did the best thing you could.

871
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,030
- Dora?
- Yeah.

872
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:40,709
Do you think I'm doing
the right thing, going after her?

873
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,917
Honey, if I could see
one of my babies again,

874
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:48,349
even if I had to go
halfway round the world,

875
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,630
nothing could stop me.

876
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,468
I don't even know where she is.

877
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,709
I guess I gotta find her.

878
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,718
If I could just see her one time,
Dora...

879
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,237
...l'd die happy.

880
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,789
You'll find her. I know you will.

881
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,113
You gonna miss me?

882
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:29,710
I miss you already.

883
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:44,596
Do you remember the first night
that we saw Blue in Abilene?

884
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,156
Sure I remember.

885
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,748
And he was covered with dust.

886
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,714
And he walked up to me and said,
"Ma'am, would you dance with me?"

887
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:58,518
The dust from his clothes
kept making me sneeze.

888
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,756
And he just laughed.

889
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:04,395
And the more that I sneezed,
the more we laughed.

890
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:08,794
That was when I knew
that we were both done for.

891
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:14,869
Later that night, he rode his horse
right up the stairs to my room,

892
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,116
kicked the banister right off.

893
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:22,390
What are you gonna do
with a fella like that?

894
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,599
Ma'am.

895
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,838
Will you dance with me?

896
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,753
Come on.

897
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,389
I danced with a girl
with a hole in her stocking

898
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,239
And her heels kept a-knocking
and her knees kept a-rocking

899
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,749
I danced with a girl
with a hole in her stocking

900
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,030
And we danced
by the light of the moon

901
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:07,276
Buffalo girls,
won't you come out tonight

902
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,391
Come out tonight, come out tonight?

903
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,715
Buffalo girls,
won't you come out tonight

904
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,354
And dance by the light of the moon?

905
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,153
Dear Janey,

906
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:36,238
I'm coming halfway round the world
to find you.

907
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:37,952
I aim to bring you home

908
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,277
and give you all the things
I should have given you all along.

909
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,038
I ain't never been lucky,

910
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,151
but either
my luck has finally changed

911
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:49,068
or God's taken pity on a confirmed
old sinner like your mother.

912
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,509
I caught up to Billy's show
in New York

913
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,596
as they were pulling up the anchor.

914
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:57,269
An hour later,
and I'd have had to swim for it.

915
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:01,959
Billy!

916
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,958
Billy, damn it! Wait for me.

917
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:08,433
Martha Jane.

918
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,552
You almost missed your chance
of me making you famous.

919
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,796
I told you, Billy,
I already am famous.

920
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,512
You can make me immortal.

921
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:18,438
- I'm so glad to see you.
- It's good to see you, too.

922
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,835
Come on. Go!

923
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:27,277
Howdy, fellas. Howdy, boys.

924
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,473
Howdy.

925
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,078
Jim!

926
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:35,913
Calam!

927
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:39,589
What are you doing here? I thought
you wanted nothing to do with it.

928
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:42,632
To tell you the truth,
I couldn't live without you boys.

929
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:46,150
- I cried myself to sleep at night.
- Yeah, I'll buy that!

930
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,308
Think this rig'll get us
all the way to England?

931
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:55,356
- I'll be damned.
- What?

932
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:58,358
Sitting Bull. Billy's crazy.

933
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,270
Tell me,
why have you forsaken your people?

934
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:09,078
Perhaps you haven't realised,
Sitting Bull.

935
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,316
We are both on this boat together.

936
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:16,318
Then you will die alone in the water
and I'll feed you to the fish.

937
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,232
Howdy, chief.

938
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,070
How'd you like a little smoke?

939
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,794
Think about
trading in your life for his.

940
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:32,711
- Is it a good cigar?
- Yeah, it's real good.

941
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,675
He has become too popular.

942
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:49,552
It has confused him
about what is important.

943
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:53,150
Nah. He never knew
about what was important.

944
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,236
What the hell is that?

945
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,316
Pull!

946
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,355
Annie Oakley? Calamity Jane.

947
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:13,232
- How do you do?
- Howdy.

948
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,191
Pull!

949
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:21,317
Seeing as we're the only two females
in this here outfit,

950
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,351
how about I buy you a little drink?

951
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:26,790
Thank you, but I don't drink. Pull.

952
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,790
Well, how about if I join you?

953
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:33,718
See how I do against
the world's famous markswoman.

954
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,716
I only compete in the arena.

955
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:41,914
- Excuse me. I do need to practise.
- Me, too. I need to practise, too.

956
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,598
Pull.

957
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,073
Damn.

958
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,273
Pull.

959
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:59,351
I got that one! I hit that last one.

960
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:00,959
Pull.

961
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:34,633
Were you gonna leave
without saying goodbye to me?

962
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:38,756
Why do you have to go
to Belle Fourche?

963
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:43,315
- This is a good town for business.
- You mean it's convenient for you?

964
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:46,398
And just the right distance off
so you can come and visit me

965
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:49,080
and your new little wife
won't find out about me?

966
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,949
Don't you pull that on me.

967
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:57,029
A wife is one thing. Love is another.

968
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,433
I never would have married her
if I'd understood.

969
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,597
I never would have married her
if you'd told me the truth.

970
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:06,280
Dora, it's not too late
to change your mind.

971
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:09,753
It is too late.
It's over. I've sold this place.

972
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,996
- Dora...
- Don't start with me, Blue!

973
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,873
You don't deserve feeling sorry for.

974
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,592
I'm not going to Belle Fourche.

975
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:18,915
- Maybe it's better that way.
- Maybe it is.

976
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:22,350
If the whole point is to get
as far away from me as you can,

977
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:25,313
maybe you
should have gone to England.

978
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,874
You could have been
a regular Lillie Langtry.

979
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,150
- Maybe you should have gone.
- Yeah?

980
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:34,114
You're a better rider and roper
than any of those other cowboys.

981
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,876
Come here.

982
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:54,193
Don't leave me, Dora.

983
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,032
Please.

984
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,189
Can't it be
like it's always been between us?

985
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,878
I can't.

986
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:10,711
Every time,
it gets harder for me to let you go.

987
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,195
It's gotten to the point where

988
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:18,518
I fear your leaving
from the moment you arrive,

989
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:23,475
and it makes it awful hard
to find any joy in life.

990
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:29,031
Don't ever think that the loving

991
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:34,470
and the hurting ain't on both sides.

992
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,951
- I gotta go.
- No.

993
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,513
I gotta go.

994
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:57,790
Dora.

995
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,313
Darling Janey,

996
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:12,350
Your mother was not meant
for sea travelling.

997
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,630
The boat rolls day and night.

998
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:18,389
I had no notion
there was so much water in the world.

999
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,434
No Ears saw a whale today.

1000
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:33,950
He thinks it is the most
extraordinary event in his long life.

1001
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:37,475
He thinks it might be the first fish,

1002
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,273
or maybe the first creature
of any kind.

1003
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:45,428
He said it was so large, it might
even be as old as the world itself.

1004
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:47,551
We ain't even got to England yet,

1005
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,750
and he can hardly wait
to get home again

1006
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:51,950
and tell his people about the whale.

1007
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:55,239
I don't think
I ever saw him so happy.

1008
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:25,915
This London is a great place.

1009
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:28,998
It ain't the same sky
we have back home.

1010
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,315
I ain't never been no great tracker,

1011
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:35,797
but this place has me confounded,
I can't tell which way is which.

1012
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:39,674
No sun or mountains
to take your bearings from.

1013
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:42,678
Just buildings everywhere you look.

1014
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:46,952
I can't figure out how people can
tell where the hell they're going,

1015
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:51,710
let alone how I can find one house
and one little girl.

1016
01:26:56,120 --> 01:27:00,193
You boys go on exploring. I got me
some business to attend to.

1017
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:03,278
What kind of business
you got in these parts?

1018
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:11,430
You know I ain't exactly
the churchgoing type, Janey.

1019
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:14,632
Generally, even my backsliding
goes unrepented.

1020
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:18,309
But a little prayer keeps going
round and round in my head.

1021
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:21,079
"Please let me find my little girl."

1022
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,839
The sun has not gone down
a single day

1023
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:26,474
that I ain't regretted
giving you away.

1024
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:30,479
I know I ain't no blue-ribbon prize,
but I ain't a quitter neither.

1025
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:34,195
By God, I'm gonna find you, honey,
or go belly up trying.

1026
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:39,155
Cos whatever else I am,
I will always be your mother.

1027
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,077
Martha Jane.

1028
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,911
Miss Canary.

1029
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:53,588
I knew you were in London.
I've seen the posters for your show.

1030
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,470
But you didn't expect
to see me again.

1031
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,237
Please, come in.

1032
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:11,471
Please, come in.

1033
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,835
May I offer you some tea?

1034
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,273
No, thank you.

1035
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:21,675
Something a little stronger, perhaps?

1036
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:25,516
- No.
- Thank you, Daphne. No.

1037
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:39,356
I'm sorry about your wife.

1038
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:42,751
Thank you. Please sit down.

1039
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:51,159
Janey's just a little girl.

1040
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:55,229
It seems to me she needs a mother.

1041
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,551
I may not be much,
but I am her mother.

1042
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,356
I guess she's got a right to know it.

1043
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,440
I can understand your feelings,
of course,

1044
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,949
and in many respects you are right.

1045
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:14,868
But you must also understand that
Janey knows nothing about you.

1046
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:19,870
As far as she is concerned,
we are her natural parents.

1047
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,915
- That's what you told her?
- Yes, it is.

1048
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:26,074
We believed it would make her happy.

1049
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:28,790
And she has been a very happy child.

1050
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:32,989
I don't want to scare her or nothing,

1051
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,588
but I want to take her home with me.

1052
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:39,190
Miss Canary, when I first met you,
you didn't have a home.

1053
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:44,159
Your life was hardly appropriate
to bringing up a child.

1054
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,316
Can you tell me how
your circumstances have changed?

1055
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:52,638
Well, my friend Dora,
that's Miss DuFran,

1056
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:55,513
has offered us her house to share.

1057
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:59,189
We'd be a good family to Janey. You
wouldn't have to worry about that.

1058
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:01,436
She'd never go cold or hungry.

1059
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:04,518
What kind of house is it, exactly?

1060
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,790
It's just, you know, a house.

1061
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:15,833
When can I meet her?

1062
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:18,713
I'm not sure
that would be at all wise.

1063
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:24,793
Mister, I'm gonna tell you,

1064
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:27,434
one way or the other,

1065
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:29,915
I'm coming back.

1066
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:31,917
And I'm gonna see her.

1067
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,070
How about a drink, pal?

1068
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:02,674
- You want a pint?
- You sell whiskey by the pint?

1069
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,631
One hell of a country.

1070
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:13,438
You must be Annie Oakley.

1071
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:15,195
What?

1072
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:17,914
Annie Oakley,
the famous markswoman.

1073
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:19,758
I ain't her.

1074
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:22,792
- Pour me another one.
- Come on.

1075
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,793
Who are you, then?

1076
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,960
I am goddamn Calamity Jane.

1077
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:31,990
I can outshoot and outride
that prissy little Miss Oakley

1078
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:34,588
with one hand tied behind my back.

1079
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,393
Look at this.

1080
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:38,792
She-devil of the Yellowstone.

1081
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:43,391
Scout for General Custer.
Bullwhacker.

1082
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:47,276
Damn fine shot, too.

1083
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:56,357
You English are all kinda skittish,
ain't you?

1084
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:59,311
Alright, on your way.

1085
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:03,078
- I'm putting this fella in ten.
- Right.

1086
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:09,389
There's a tavern in the town

1087
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,832
There's a...

1088
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:13,518
Come back here.

1089
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:22,553
Yeah.

1090
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,512
Skittish.

1091
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:32,671
Where the hell
are you dragging me to now?

1092
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,268
Just wait. I got an idea.

1093
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:39,113
Damn, this fog is solid.

1094
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:43,833
I have never seen
such a place for fog.

1095
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:46,315
One minute,
you can see where you're going.

1096
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:50,228
The next minute,
you can't hardly see your feet.

1097
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:54,633
- This way.
- Yeah.

1098
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:57,911
Come on. That's it. That's it.

1099
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,790
Well, I'll be blowed.

1100
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:41,439
- Ain't they a sight?
- Yeah.

1101
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:04,397
Howdy, Calam.

1102
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:08,593
Well, I'll be jiggered.
No Ears said you'd found beaver.

1103
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:11,518
But I didn't believe it.

1104
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:19,712
Boys...

1105
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:23,117
...I need money.

1106
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:25,754
- How much you got?
- Not much.

1107
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:28,917
I'm putting it away
for something important, Calam.

1108
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,793
It's just a loan, Jim.
Did I ever not pay you back?

1109
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:33,911
Yeah. Plenty of times.

1110
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:36,235
Come on, Bartle, how much you got?

1111
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,472
Well...

1112
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:40,993
Here.

1113
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:43,394
I need some back.

1114
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,112
Tell her what for.

1115
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:50,629
I have a weakness, Calamity.

1116
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:52,716
One I don't know about, you mean?

1117
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,956
If you're blind and deaf, you don't.

1118
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:01,835
I got an overpowering fondness
for red-haired ladies.

1119
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,318
Why, Bartle Bone, I'm taken aback.

1120
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,150
Hope it makes you happy, Bartle.

1121
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:19,199
It don't usually last long.

1122
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:25,712
But there are moments, Martha Jane,
moments of true and outright joy.

1123
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,791
Jim.

1124
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:43,710
I gotta have it back, Calam.

1125
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,470
I swear, Jim.

1126
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:49,910
Thanks, fellas. You're true friends.

1127
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:56,234
Think we'll ever
see that money again?

1128
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:01,757
Gentlemen,
can we please try it again?

1129
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:12,158
Annie is the only one in the show

1130
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:14,953
still allowed
to use real bullets in her guns.

1131
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:17,389
I've been watching her like a hawk

1132
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,353
and have yet to see her miss once.

1133
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,753
I need an advance on my wages
for the run of the show.

1134
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:27,233
- All of it?
- Yeah.

1135
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:31,319
And if I get thrown in jail too many
times, just let me rot in there.

1136
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,908
Well, hell, I'll give you the money.

1137
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:38,272
I don't want to hear more about this.
Not another nickel till next year.

1138
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:41,312
Thanks, Billy. I'll drive the hell
out of that stage.

1139
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:45,115
Listen. You get an idea
to shoot up another saloon,

1140
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:48,596
you go ahead and I'll bail you out,
cos it's good publicity.

1141
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,358
Thanks, Billy.

1142
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:23,349
Howdy, gents.

1143
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,511
I'm looking to make a small bet...

1144
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:32,632
...on a shooting match tomorrow
between Annie Oakley

1145
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:35,911
and this duke fella
y'all got shooting for your side.

1146
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:38,156
Lord.

1147
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:42,912
Lord Windhouvern.

1148
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:48,199
There are those of us who'd put money
on the English marksman winning.

1149
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:49,878
Good.

1150
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,878
- How do the odds stand?
- Two to one.

1151
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,112
Favouring the Englishman.

1152
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:58,792
Let's make it
a little more interesting.

1153
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:02,071
The contest
is best out of 1,000 shots.

1154
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:07,399
What would the odds be if I bet Annie
Oakley beat this guy by ten shots?

1155
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:14,638
I'd say you could easily get...
three to one.

1156
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:16,239
Fine.

1157
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,952
And if she beat this fella
by 40 shots?

1158
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:26,794
Ridiculous.

1159
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:30,276
- What would the odds be?
- You'd be throwing your money away.

1160
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:32,595
Well, it wouldn't be the first time.

1161
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:35,029
I'm looking for ten to one.

1162
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:40,834
Annie beats this guy by 40 shots
and I put up 200.

1163
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,916
Anybody take that bet?

1164
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:48,517
Come over here and we'll find some
fella we can trust to hold on to it.

1165
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,793
Alright, sir.
You're charged with trespassing.

1166
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:00,556
Just the fella we can trust.

1167
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:02,833
Hold on to this for us.

1168
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:05,758
There's no need
to arrest this gentleman, officer.

1169
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:08,997
But we would appreciate it
if you'd hold the fund...

1170
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:12,594
...until a small wager is settled.

1171
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:16,597
Glad to do it, Lord Windhouvern.

1172
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:19,871
So you're him.
Well, this should be fun.

1173
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,198
I want to know the name of the man

1174
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:27,198
who would bet so heavily
on my defeat.

1175
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:30,038
The name's Calamity Jane.

1176
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,837
Have a good time
at the shooting match.

1177
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,072
Miss Oakley?

1178
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:48,398
Can I speak to you privately
for a minute, please?

1179
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:51,549
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

1180
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:55,471
- What is it?
- See you later.

1181
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:59,389
I need your help.

1182
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:02,398
But I can't very well ask you
without telling you why.

1183
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:05,232
I know how to keep a confidence.

1184
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,112
Sure.

1185
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:17,556
A few years ago, I had a child.

1186
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:23,238
That's why I came out here.
To find my little girl.

1187
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:26,992
Now, I need enough money
to bring her back home.

1188
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:29,634
I've scraped together
everything I could

1189
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:32,558
and bet it all
on your shooting match tomorrow.

1190
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:36,195
You gambled it all?
Everything you have?

1191
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:38,717
Yeah. And then some.

1192
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:46,153
- Am I supposed to win or lose?
- Win, of course.

1193
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:48,748
I might be crazy but I'm not stupid.

1194
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:51,189
You're the best anybody's ever seen.

1195
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:54,999
I met this English lord.
He ain't much.

1196
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:59,156
- How much do I have to win by?
- 40 shots.

1197
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:05,035
Well, I'll do my best,

1198
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:08,277
but even if I hit
every one out of a thousand,

1199
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:11,073
that means he's still
gonna have to miss at least 40.

1200
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:14,872
I ain't never been lucky,
but you have.

1201
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,514
You're the luckiest person
I ever saw.

1202
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:23,351
Jane, when I was five,
my father died,

1203
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:27,158
leaving my mother
with seven children to raise.

1204
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:32,196
I took his old rifle off the mantel
and learned how to use it.

1205
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:35,958
If I missed a bird or a squirrel,
we didn't eat.

1206
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:37,752
I learned not to miss.

1207
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:39,836
It wasn't luck. It was necessity.

1208
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,877
I sure got plenty of that.

1209
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:46,879
Well, it seems to me,
in the long run,

1210
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,719
that good and bad luck
kinda balance each other out.

1211
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:52,829
I ain't got time for the long run.

1212
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:56,270
I gotta do everything right
this time.

1213
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,470
It's the only chance I'll ever have.

1214
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:03,310
Careful. Careful!

1215
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:17,832
Look out, ma'am!

1216
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:27,959
Sorry.

1217
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:31,075
- You sure are in a fix, miss.
- Yes.

1218
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:32,997
Here, let me get that for you.

1219
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:35,429
Thank you.

1220
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:40,634
I...

1221
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:43,832
- Where was you headed, ma'am?
- Actually, I'm just there.

1222
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:52,351
- What's your name, mister?
- Ogden. Ogden Prideaux.

1223
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:54,835
Nice to meet you, Mr Prideaux.

1224
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,477
Did she break a leg?

1225
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:02,068
Good Lord, no. I just lost a shoe.

1226
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:06,353
- Here's your shoe, ma'am.
- Come on. Get back inside.

1227
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:08,994
Now you've rescued me,
would you like some tea?

1228
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:11,076
- Are you fond of tea?
- Tea?

1229
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:14,078
Maybe you should
hitch your wagon first.

1230
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:18,994
We haven't been formally introduced.
I'm Miss Dora DuFran.

1231
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:22,112
I would be pleased if you would
join me for a cup of tea.

1232
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:24,754
After you've hitched your wagon,
of course.

1233
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:28,995
Ma'am, I intend to be right back.

1234
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:33,675
He ain't coming back
in them muddy boots.

1235
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:35,153
Don't get all worked up.

1236
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:38,272
I ain't having five pounds of mud
on my floor this early.

1237
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:40,630
We ain't open yet.
We ain't even unpacked.

1238
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:42,796
You may not be open yet, but I am.

1239
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:45,992
It won't kill anybody
if I have a gentleman for tea.

1240
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:51,272
From the looks of him,
he can drink a bucket of tea.

1241
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:53,914
Then you'd best go get a bucket.

1242
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,990
- Ogden?
- Ma'am?

1243
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:11,997
You seem awfully far away.

1244
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:15,749
Would you mind
if I sat a little bit closer?

1245
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:21,352
- Sit anyplace you like, Miss Dora.
- Thank you.

1246
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:34,593
There. That's better.

1247
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:55,508
Ogden, you take my breath away.

1248
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:58,675
Am I too heavy?

1249
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:01,553
No, ma'am,
you're as light as a feather.

1250
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:05,434
Then why don't you pick me up
and carry me over to that bed?

1251
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:52,709
Are you happy, Ogden?

1252
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:54,432
Happy?

1253
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:59,073
This has been the happiest day
of my whole life.

1254
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:02,791
Wouldn't it be nice
if we could go on like this?

1255
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:06,838
You mean me staying here?

1256
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:14,438
Would you like to marry me, Ogden?

1257
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:23,273
You mean like Ma and Pa?

1258
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:28,873
Yeah, like Ma and Pa.

1259
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:35,111
Well, will we do it today or when?

1260
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:39,070
We could. Or tomorrow.

1261
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:43,509
Well, let's do it today
so you don't change your mind.

1262
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,389
I'm not gonna change my mind.

1263
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:28,629
Pull.

1264
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,279
Mark.

1265
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:40,393
Pull.

1266
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:48,389
Mark.

1267
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:04,632
Pull.

1268
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:10,553
Mark.

1269
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:15,313
She missed one.
She's never missed one before.

1270
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:18,671
For goodness' sake,
she hit the first 99.

1271
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:20,313
She's only human.

1272
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:23,716
This ain't a good time
for her to be only human.

1273
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:27,992
How come?
How much you got on this?

1274
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:30,270
- Everything.
- Everything?

1275
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:35,511
The redhead money?
The beaver money? On the bet?

1276
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:38,438
- Are you crazy?
- Goddamn calamitous is what I am.

1277
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:39,834
Mark.

1278
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:56,239
Billy.

1279
01:48:57,560 --> 01:48:59,198
Did he pick up a stone?

1280
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:02,915
I think he's got a loose shoe.

1281
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:05,270
I can take care of that.

1282
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:09,439
You know where
Dora DuFran's establishment is?

1283
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:11,278
That's it, right over yonder.

1284
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:13,197
Hotel Royale.

1285
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:20,593
- Who's that?
- His name's Ogden Prideaux.

1286
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:24,599
Why's he painting Dora's?

1287
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:27,314
Why? Cos he's married to her.

1288
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:34,792
- That boy is married to Dora?
- Yep.

1289
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:36,592
Talk of the town.

1290
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:40,596
I'll be in the saloon.

1291
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:57,313
Oh, my God.

1292
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,115
- You seen him?
- Yes.

1293
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:06,389
He must have found out
or else he'd be on his way here.

1294
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:08,793
What if he shoots Ogden?

1295
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:12,833
If he shoots him, he'd better
shoot him dead, cos Ogden's big.

1296
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:15,315
What am I gonna do, Doosie?

1297
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:17,908
- Tell me what to do.
- Alright.

1298
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:20,759
Go downstairs and give Ogden a rifle

1299
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:22,836
and tell him
he should go shoot an elk.

1300
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:25,030
- Good.
- He could take the wagon.

1301
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:28,391
And tell him he's not to come back
without that elk.

1302
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:33,551
- Blue.
- Frank. Whiskey.

1303
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:36,399
I ain't seen you
since the Deadwood days.

1304
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:39,637
Don't you go disturbing the peace,
alright?

1305
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:42,877
I mean, the jail here
ain't up to your standards.

1306
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,638
I ain't disturbing the peace.

1307
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:51,596
She must still like him.

1308
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:54,390
There goes Ogden.

1309
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:57,193
Maybe he'll use up
all his ammunition hunting.

1310
01:50:57,320 --> 01:51:01,996
Won't have any left to kill you with
when he finds you with his wife.

1311
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:07,234
He ain't gonna find me
with his... wife.

1312
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:28,199
Blue, I'm so sorry.
Don't be mad at me.

1313
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:31,473
Come in.

1314
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:39,798
Mark.

1315
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:44,517
Pull.

1316
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,868
Mark.

1317
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:50,148
Pull.

1318
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:57,630
I'm surprised you could tear yourself
away from the beaver pond.

1319
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:59,318
- Yep.
- Yeah.

1320
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:02,955
I figure the zoo's gonna send you
a couple of 'em.

1321
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:04,433
- Maybe?
- Yeah.

1322
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:07,791
- And if they don't?
- Maybe I'll stay here.

1323
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:09,478
And not go back.

1324
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:12,717
I ain't living my life here. No way.

1325
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:16,230
Well, yours is yours and mine's mine.

1326
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:21,270
I have lived 35 years with you

1327
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:25,916
and, by God, you would rather have
the company of a beaver.

1328
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:30,308
Pull.

1329
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:20,319
We can't do this any more.

1330
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:22,670
Dora, I keep telling you

1331
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:27,032
that my marriage hasn't changed
the way I feel about you.

1332
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:30,709
And that's the truth
as far as I'm concerned.

1333
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:32,990
Did your marriage change everything?

1334
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:35,791
No, not everything.

1335
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:40,038
- Some things can't be changed.
- No.

1336
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:42,832
Don't go.

1337
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:46,118
Just... five more minutes.

1338
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:49,479
What if he gets an elk right away?

1339
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:52,751
He's not gonna find an elk
for five or ten miles.

1340
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,752
What...

1341
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:03,476
Whatever possessed you
to marry that boy?

1342
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:05,352
I don't know.

1343
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:08,470
He carried me out of the mud.

1344
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:14,468
That is the sanest reason
for getting married I ever heard.

1345
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:18,912
I wish I'd known that in Deadwood.
There's plenty of mud there.

1346
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:21,679
We could have had
ten grandkids by now.

1347
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:24,598
Don't talk like that.
You'll make me cry.

1348
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:27,632
Hush, Dora, the sky ain't falling.

1349
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:31,150
You got a fine strapping youth
to take care of you.

1350
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,118
Better than a broken-down
old cowpoke like me.

1351
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:39,596
And I love you the most.
I can't help it, Blue.

1352
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:44,191
- I love you the most.
- I know you do.

1353
01:54:45,240 --> 01:54:48,710
Sometimes,
things just get away from me.

1354
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:51,229
Yeah, I guess they do.

1355
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:52,873
Who got married first?

1356
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,911
Let's not argue about that.

1357
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:59,716
We can argue about that till
bulls grow teats. It won't make...

1358
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:03,309
It won't make any difference.

1359
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:12,473
And what...

1360
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:16,388
What about this boy?

1361
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:21,069
Is he old enough to...

1362
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:27,432
- Is he old enough to talk?
- Don't be mocking my husband.

1363
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:29,915
He's a peach of a boy
and I'm fond of him.

1364
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:35,194
Well, I'm gonna call him Ox.

1365
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:39,428
You know
what the function of an ox is?

1366
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:45,028
The function of an ox
is to take you out of the mud.

1367
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:49,597
And as long as you restrict him
to mud duty,

1368
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:52,109
you won't hear no complaint from me.

1369
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:56,436
Blue, it turns out I needed somebody.

1370
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:02,557
He's only a boy, but he's a good boy.

1371
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:05,708
I was only joshing you, Dora.

1372
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:11,354
I've joshed you
a thousand times before.

1373
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:14,751
What's the matter?

1374
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:18,589
I don't know. I'm not myself.

1375
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:23,478
Mark.

1376
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:25,435
Pull.

1377
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:29,279
Mark.

1378
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:38,798
Everybody's gonna
come see the show now.

1379
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:45,628
Your Royal Highness,
ladies and gentlemen.

1380
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:47,591
Miss Annie Oakley,

1381
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:50,996
the greatest American markswoman
of all time,

1382
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:52,473
has won the day.

1383
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:55,910
- What's the score? I can't look?
- She's gonna win. Easy.

1384
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:57,598
Yeah, but how much?

1385
01:57:57,720 --> 01:58:02,191
The final score,
Lord Windhouvern, 935,

1386
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:06,233
and Miss Annie Oakley, 984.

1387
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:10,354
84 minus 35.

1388
01:58:10,480 --> 01:58:13,153
I can't think. Is that more than 40,
Bartle? Help me.

1389
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:14,838
I don't know.

1390
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:17,713
35, 45, 55, 60...

1391
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:22,474
Good bet, madam. Well done.

1392
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:31,674
Here's beaver money, redhead money

1393
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:35,713
and every dime I ever owed you
in my life with interest!

1394
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:37,592
She did it!

1395
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:47,152
You're a better shot than Cody,
if that's a consolation.

1396
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:48,633
It's not, but thank you.

1397
01:58:52,760 --> 01:58:53,988
Yeah!

1398
01:58:54,120 --> 01:58:56,190
I only wish you was a drinking woman.

1399
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:59,437
I never wanted
to buy somebody a drink so bad.

1400
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:02,472
As a matter of fact,
I am feeling extremely thirsty.

1401
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:08,233
Here's to Annie Oakley,
the greatest shot that ever lived.

1402
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:12,952
No.

1403
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:15,830
To all of us buffalo girls.

1404
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:18,235
- We gotta stick together.
- Yeah.

1405
01:59:33,480 --> 01:59:37,393
- Got one, Doosie.
- Yeah. Come on in.

1406
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:39,758
You did good.

1407
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:53,037
Dora?

1408
01:59:58,160 --> 01:59:59,309
What's the matter?

1409
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:05,474
Are you sick?

1410
02:00:15,320 --> 02:00:16,878
Dora?

1411
02:00:20,240 --> 02:00:21,912
I guess I know why you're crying.

1412
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,149
Why?

1413
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:32,758
Well, you don't want
to be married to me no more.

1414
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:42,191
It's alright, though. I mean,
I was expecting this and all.

1415
02:00:46,680 --> 02:00:47,999
Ogden.

1416
02:01:32,040 --> 02:01:33,758
Good afternoon, Miss Canary.

1417
02:01:33,880 --> 02:01:35,233
Captain O'Neill.

1418
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:36,713
I trust I find you well.

1419
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:39,070
Yep. I'm really well, thank you.

1420
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:40,633
Good.

1421
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:43,876
Is Janey here? Can I see her?

1422
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:47,348
No, I'm afraid
she's out at the moment.

1423
02:01:49,320 --> 02:01:50,878
Did you tell her about me?

1424
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:53,549
No, I did not.

1425
02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:59,119
- I told you I was coming back.
- I know.

1426
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:04,829
Miss Canary, I will do nothing that
could disturb or upset Jane's life.

1427
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:08,158
You son of a snake.

1428
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:10,840
I am only considering
Jane's best interests.

1429
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:13,713
The hell you are!
She's my daughter.

1430
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:16,513
She needs the sun and the sky
and the Rocky Mountains

1431
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:18,073
and she needs me.

1432
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:20,998
I could show her things
most people just dream about.

1433
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:24,839
Could you?

1434
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:27,235
- Yes, I could.
- Then come with me.

1435
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:31,472
- You throwing me out, mister?
- No, I am not.

1436
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:36,397
I want to show you something.
Come with me.

1437
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,230
Come on, darling. Come on.

1438
02:03:06,360 --> 02:03:09,591
Daddy, did you see me?
Did you see me jump that tree?

1439
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:11,915
I did, my darling,
and it was wonderful.

1440
02:03:13,120 --> 02:03:16,271
Janey, I'd like you
to meet Miss Canary.

1441
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:17,879
How do you do?

1442
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,833
A whole lot better
now that I get to meet you.

1443
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:22,552
Miss Canary has come a long way.

1444
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:24,830
All the way from America.
She's a kind of...

1445
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:26,552
- Kind of a cousin.
- A cousin.

1446
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:29,876
Have I ever met you before?

1447
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:32,753
Yeah.

1448
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:37,279
But you were just a little bitty
thing. Too young to remember me.

1449
02:03:39,160 --> 02:03:41,310
That was some pretty good riding.

1450
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:43,158
Thank you. Do you ride?

1451
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:47,558
I got me a big black stallion. He was
pretty wild in his younger days.

1452
02:03:47,680 --> 02:03:50,069
- I love horses, don't I, Daddy?
- Yes.

1453
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:51,952
I hope to have my own one day.

1454
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:55,832
- I know you will.
- Do you really think so?

1455
02:03:55,960 --> 02:03:58,679
Come on, Jane, it's getting late.
We'd better go back.

1456
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:00,916
Are you coming to dinner with us?

1457
02:04:03,160 --> 02:04:05,151
Well, I wish I could.

1458
02:04:06,080 --> 02:04:07,672
But I know we'll meet again.

1459
02:04:07,800 --> 02:04:09,392
- Come on.
- Bye-bye.

1460
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:11,158
Bye-bye, Janey.

1461
02:04:12,240 --> 02:04:14,071
I'm getting better and better.

1462
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:16,236
Are you listening to your instructor?

1463
02:04:16,360 --> 02:04:18,715
- Of course.
- What did you learn today?

1464
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:21,070
I learned to go
from a trot to a canter.

1465
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:13,879
You had to hand it to Billy.

1466
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:17,072
He sure knew
how to put on one hell of a show.

1467
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:18,553
He got so famous,

1468
02:05:18,680 --> 02:05:22,309
they put a statue of him
in Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum.

1469
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:23,793
He dragged me to see it

1470
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:26,878
and in the basement
I found the damnedest things.

1471
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:35,111
Look. Here's some special glue.

1472
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:04,198
How's that? Can you hear better?

1473
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:08,310
I can hear many things.

1474
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:50,430
The West began with Lewis and Clark,

1475
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:53,996
two brave and fearless mountain men

1476
02:06:54,120 --> 02:07:00,229
who blazed the trail westward
all the way to the Pacific.

1477
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:33,714
And next,
for your entertainment pleasure,

1478
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:35,990
ladies and gentlemen,

1479
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:38,270
the wildest woman of the West...

1480
02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:42,630
...Calamity Jane!

1481
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:02,313
Give me back that ear.

1482
02:08:03,320 --> 02:08:04,958
You have no bullets.

1483
02:08:05,080 --> 02:08:07,310
Sorry, I forgot.

1484
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:11,079
You mess with No Ears,
I'll eat your liver.

1485
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:15,189
Calamity, you're on. Go!

1486
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:17,038
Get on your horses!

1487
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:20,991
Woman Who Walks Like A Man
can walk no more.

1488
02:09:21,120 --> 02:09:23,509
No, Sitting Bull,
it's just a show now.

1489
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:55,158
Miss Canary.

1490
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:59,995
Janey has been pleading with me to
allow her to come and see the show.

1491
02:10:00,120 --> 02:10:02,839
And so finally,
I had to give in and bring her.

1492
02:10:06,360 --> 02:10:09,636
I didn't know
that you were Calamity Jane.

1493
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:11,751
Is it really the last night?

1494
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:14,155
Can't we come again tomorrow?

1495
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:18,318
What do you say you and me
go for a little ride together?

1496
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:21,270
I'm not sure.

1497
02:10:22,680 --> 02:10:25,558
Just round the ring.
She'll be safe with me.

1498
02:10:26,240 --> 02:10:28,151
Can I, Daddy? Please?

1499
02:10:31,520 --> 02:10:32,873
Very well.

1500
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:36,632
Come on.

1501
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:54,390
In my lifetime
I've had a lot of misadventures,

1502
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:57,592
but my great joys have been few.

1503
02:10:57,720 --> 02:11:00,917
The time I held you in my arms
the day you were born

1504
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:04,919
and the time I held you sitting
up there in front of me in the saddle

1505
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:07,429
like I imagined you
hundreds of times.

1506
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:12,191
You're real to me now, Janey.

1507
02:11:12,720 --> 02:11:16,599
And for the first time,
I can finally let you go.

1508
02:11:25,640 --> 02:11:29,030
I'm here on behalf of the mayor
of Ten Sleep, Montana.

1509
02:11:29,160 --> 02:11:31,833
And the judge and sheriff, too,
for that matter.

1510
02:11:31,960 --> 02:11:35,509
We've been figuring
on starting a kind of zoo of our own

1511
02:11:35,640 --> 02:11:39,997
and supplying it with samples of
all the animals native to the area.

1512
02:11:40,120 --> 02:11:42,588
But we've been having trouble
with the beaver.

1513
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:46,156
You see,
the beaver's been all trapped out.

1514
02:11:46,280 --> 02:11:50,796
We looked all over them parts,
but have been unable to find any.

1515
02:11:50,920 --> 02:11:54,117
So I was wondering
if you could see your way clear

1516
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:57,073
to selling us a healthy pair.

1517
02:11:57,200 --> 02:12:01,432
One male and one female...

1518
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:06,072
...so they... so they might...

1519
02:12:09,080 --> 02:12:11,036
...you know.

1520
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:13,594
Would you sell us a pair of your own?

1521
02:12:22,680 --> 02:12:24,796
It's Calamity!

1522
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:26,638
Hi, darling.

1523
02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:30,275
This here's Comanche.
He's the best horse in the show.

1524
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:33,198
He might look
like a big handful right now,

1525
02:12:33,320 --> 02:12:36,153
but you take charge of him,
make him respect you.

1526
02:12:36,280 --> 02:12:37,838
For me? Really?

1527
02:12:37,960 --> 02:12:39,871
Yeah, he's for you.

1528
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:41,592
I will. I promise.

1529
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:46,277
- Excuse me. One moment.
- I'm so glad we have the same name.

1530
02:12:47,200 --> 02:12:49,316
I want to be just like you
when I grow up.

1531
02:12:50,920 --> 02:12:54,356
Well, maybe just... not just like me.

1532
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:58,277
But there'll always be
a streak of me in you.

1533
02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:00,755
And a streak of your daddy, too.

1534
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:07,356
Goodbye, little Janey.

1535
02:13:08,360 --> 02:13:10,316
I'll write to you.

1536
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:12,476
Goodbye, Calamity.

1537
02:13:49,480 --> 02:13:51,436
What's the matter?

1538
02:13:51,560 --> 02:13:54,279
You've been moping
round here since Blue left.

1539
02:13:56,120 --> 02:13:58,076
I ain't feeling so good.

1540
02:13:59,480 --> 02:14:01,391
What's ailing you?

1541
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:04,193
You wanted a husband,
you got you one.

1542
02:14:05,400 --> 02:14:07,391
I think I'm gonna have a child.

1543
02:14:20,720 --> 02:14:23,917
Well, I'll be... You sure is!

1544
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:30,068
I'd have seen it if you weren't
so puffy from all that crying.

1545
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:32,953
Get in bed and stay there.

1546
02:14:33,080 --> 02:14:35,958
You ain't gonna do a lick of work
till you have this baby.

1547
02:14:36,080 --> 02:14:38,196
I have too much to think about.

1548
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:41,039
Think laying down.
You done miscarried twice.

1549
02:14:41,160 --> 02:14:43,037
I'm scared enough without that.

1550
02:14:43,160 --> 02:14:47,119
I'm trying to scare you enough
to get you back in that bed.

1551
02:14:47,240 --> 02:14:48,992
Maybe it'll be a little girl.

1552
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:53,870
It wouldn't be so dull round here
if we had us a little girl.

1553
02:14:55,680 --> 02:15:00,435
I can't be sure, Doosie, but in
my heart, I think it's Blue's child.

1554
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:08,877
Well, that don't matter much. Babies
got to take what they can find.

1555
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,560
They can't be worried
about this pa, that pa.

1556
02:15:11,680 --> 02:15:14,752
Let 'em have two pas
if they could find two.

1557
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:19,876
It ain't gonna hurt nothing.

1558
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:23,519
Both the babies that I lost
were Blue's.

1559
02:15:24,440 --> 02:15:28,433
The girl didn't live but three hours.
The little boy lived two months.

1560
02:15:29,480 --> 02:15:32,199
I wouldn't have survived
if it wasn't for Blue.

1561
02:15:34,080 --> 02:15:39,200
Well, if you want a good,
strong, live baby,

1562
02:15:39,320 --> 02:15:42,676
please, get on up and go lay down.

1563
02:15:44,120 --> 02:15:45,951
I'll make you a bowl of soup.

1564
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:50,113
Come on. You my baby now.

1565
02:16:07,600 --> 02:16:09,113
Stop!

1566
02:16:14,480 --> 02:16:15,674
Jim.

1567
02:16:21,800 --> 02:16:25,190
- We should make camp.
- But it ain't close to nightfall.

1568
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:27,597
We should stop now, make camp.

1569
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:31,120
He don't make sense,
but he ain't never wrong.

1570
02:16:44,720 --> 02:16:46,039
Jim?

1571
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:51,397
Ain't you gonna hunt up some
measly-looking critter for supper?

1572
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:00,793
Bartle?

1573
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:04,638
What do you figure?
Five to ten years,

1574
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:08,992
and the beaver'll take hold
and be plentiful again?

1575
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:12,157
Well, maybe.

1576
02:17:14,480 --> 02:17:17,040
We seen some glory days...

1577
02:17:18,320 --> 02:17:20,629
...you and me.

1578
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:30,952
Sure we did, Jim.

1579
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:34,632
Some glory days.

1580
02:17:55,840 --> 02:17:56,989
Jim?

1581
02:18:41,400 --> 02:18:43,356
There is a god, Janey.

1582
02:18:43,480 --> 02:18:46,756
After all I seen,
I feel certain of it.

1583
02:18:46,880 --> 02:18:51,556
Maybe we each had a reason for
going to the other side of the world.

1584
02:18:51,680 --> 02:18:53,989
No Ears got to see the first fish.

1585
02:18:54,920 --> 02:18:56,035
Jim...

1586
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:59,709
Well, there's always been something
of the preacher in Jim.

1587
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:02,877
The sermon
just happened to be beaver.

1588
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:06,390
Bartle got to see the world,
shake hands with the Queen,

1589
02:19:06,520 --> 02:19:09,592
and have a few moments
of outright redheaded joy.

1590
02:19:10,320 --> 02:19:12,151
As for your mother, honey,

1591
02:19:12,280 --> 02:19:17,149
if I'd had to go to the moon and back
for one look at your sweet face,

1592
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:19,840
it would've been worth
all the trouble.

1593
02:19:39,520 --> 02:19:41,590
I'm not going with you, Martha Jane.

1594
02:19:41,720 --> 02:19:43,756
I'm walking north
to the Platte River.

1595
02:19:44,400 --> 02:19:46,311
That's hundreds of miles.

1596
02:19:46,440 --> 02:19:50,353
I need to find my people,
if there are any of us left,

1597
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:53,514
and tell them
about the great whale fish.

1598
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:55,437
I hope you find your people.

1599
02:19:58,600 --> 02:20:03,116
The weather's good.
It'll be a pretty walk.

1600
02:20:05,560 --> 02:20:08,154
I'm headed to Dora's
in Belle Fourche.

1601
02:20:08,280 --> 02:20:10,919
You should come for the winter
if you can make it.

1602
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:13,679
You oughtn't to be wintering hard
at your age.

1603
02:20:14,600 --> 02:20:17,353
I'll be listening for your coming
with my new ears.

1604
02:20:17,480 --> 02:20:19,471
I'll be seeing you, No Ears.

1605
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:49,757
Congratulations. Take
possession whenever you like.

1606
02:20:49,880 --> 02:20:51,074
Thank you.

1607
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:55,559
Ogden, I just bought a hotel.
A beautiful, elegant hotel.

1608
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:57,955
We're moving to Deadwood
in the Dakotas.

1609
02:20:58,080 --> 02:21:01,516
- You mean after the baby comes?
- No. After lunch.

1610
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:03,869
Thank you.

1611
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:08,718
Take the food out there
and put it in the first wagon.

1612
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:11,511
Honey, leave the piano.

1613
02:21:11,640 --> 02:21:15,030
We'll buy a grand one
once we get the hotel prospering.

1614
02:21:15,160 --> 02:21:17,276
It's downright crazy
to be moving now.

1615
02:21:17,400 --> 02:21:20,915
No, it's not. If I wait till after
the baby's born, it'll be winter

1616
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:22,598
and I can't wait till spring.

1617
02:21:24,600 --> 02:21:25,669
Look at that.

1618
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:28,519
It's Martha Jane.

1619
02:21:29,320 --> 02:21:30,514
And Bartle.

1620
02:21:31,400 --> 02:21:33,630
Wonder where Jim is. Martha Jane!

1621
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:45,870
Bartle?

1622
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:47,709
Cody!

1623
02:21:49,240 --> 02:21:50,719
I'm so glad you're back.

1624
02:21:54,080 --> 02:21:57,470
We ain't all back. Jim's dead.

1625
02:21:59,640 --> 02:22:01,039
What did he die of?

1626
02:22:02,480 --> 02:22:04,948
Just one of them senseless things,
I guess.

1627
02:22:13,480 --> 02:22:14,595
What's this?

1628
02:22:14,720 --> 02:22:16,790
A lot happened
while you were away.

1629
02:22:17,960 --> 02:22:18,915
Yes.

1630
02:22:24,760 --> 02:22:25,988
Who's the sapsucker?

1631
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:30,479
That's Ogden. He's my husband.

1632
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:33,671
- How do?
- Howdy.

1633
02:22:38,160 --> 02:22:40,628
I guess for once I'm tongue-tied.

1634
02:22:40,760 --> 02:22:42,432
Come on. Let's have a drink.

1635
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:55,431
Did you find her? Janey?

1636
02:23:00,720 --> 02:23:01,869
Look.

1637
02:23:07,800 --> 02:23:10,473
- She's beautiful.
- Ain't she beautiful?

1638
02:23:11,920 --> 02:23:14,309
She's even more precious
than the picture.

1639
02:23:17,360 --> 02:23:19,396
She looks just like you.

1640
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:25,513
Jane, I've missed you so much.

1641
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:27,999
Me, too, Dora.

1642
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:31,670
So what you gonna do, Bartle?

1643
02:23:32,520 --> 02:23:34,238
I don't know.

1644
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:38,998
Maybe I'll track down Billy Cody
and sign back on with his show.

1645
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:43,193
I don't mind the show business.
It's a job. Pays well.

1646
02:23:43,800 --> 02:23:46,758
Never thought I'd hear you
wanting for work.

1647
02:23:46,880 --> 02:23:49,838
Maybe you just miss
them redheaded English whores.

1648
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:53,034
Maybe I do.

1649
02:23:58,040 --> 02:24:00,474
I expect I'll see you sometime,
Bartle.

1650
02:24:01,480 --> 02:24:02,799
I always have.

1651
02:24:04,720 --> 02:24:06,073
I expect.

1652
02:24:10,160 --> 02:24:12,594
We seen some glory days, Bartle.

1653
02:24:13,640 --> 02:24:15,358
You and I.

1654
02:24:16,600 --> 02:24:19,239
The like of which
may never come again.

1655
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:22,590
Yeah.

1656
02:24:23,560 --> 02:24:25,278
You and me.

1657
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:28,872
And old Jim.

1658
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:34,234
Bye, Calam.

1659
02:24:34,920 --> 02:24:36,148
Bye, Bartle.

1660
02:25:29,680 --> 02:25:30,795
Go on, you...

1661
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:34,156
...you furry little sons of bitches.

1662
02:25:37,160 --> 02:25:40,994
They could procreate,
and proliferate...

1663
02:25:41,480 --> 02:25:42,674
Jim?

1664
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:44,995
...and be plentiful again.

1665
02:25:47,160 --> 02:25:49,628
Jim!

1666
02:26:11,440 --> 02:26:13,874
Skeedle, tell 'em to unlock
the back door.

1667
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:23,318
- Isn't it grand, Doosie?
- Yeah. It's fine.

1668
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:26,750
But I'm telling you right now,
I ain't never moving no more.

1669
02:26:27,720 --> 02:26:29,472
Well, never say never.

1670
02:26:30,080 --> 02:26:33,550
Say never about something,
life'll spit it right back at you.

1671
02:26:35,200 --> 02:26:37,953
Look at me.
I said I'd never get married.

1672
02:26:38,080 --> 02:26:42,312
You married, but I ain't you,
and I ain't never moving no more.

1673
02:26:43,240 --> 02:26:44,753
Will you go lie down now?

1674
02:26:44,880 --> 02:26:47,519
Ogden? You got that bed put up?

1675
02:26:47,640 --> 02:26:50,154
Yeah, but it still needs bedding.

1676
02:26:50,960 --> 02:26:52,837
Get upstairs, if you can make it.

1677
02:26:53,440 --> 02:26:56,989
You look like you 'bout ready to
drop that baby where you standing.

1678
02:26:57,120 --> 02:26:59,918
It's coming.
The pains have started.

1679
02:27:00,040 --> 02:27:03,077
Landsakes!
Ogden, come on, pick her up!

1680
02:27:45,880 --> 02:27:47,359
Where's Blue?

1681
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:55,475
Hush now.

1682
02:27:56,360 --> 02:27:57,554
Try to sleep.

1683
02:28:00,200 --> 02:28:01,792
Doosie.

1684
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:03,478
I'm right here.

1685
02:28:04,400 --> 02:28:07,517
So's Ogden. And your baby.

1686
02:28:08,720 --> 02:28:11,917
Where's the baby?
Let me hold the baby.

1687
02:28:28,120 --> 02:28:30,918
She's a big, healthy girl.

1688
02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:33,796
She's gonna be just fine.

1689
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:37,679
Doosie, promise you'll stay.

1690
02:28:38,760 --> 02:28:40,239
Course I'll stay.

1691
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:44,912
I already told you
I wasn't moving anywhere.

1692
02:28:48,760 --> 02:28:50,751
I'll go get you some cool milk.

1693
02:28:51,600 --> 02:28:53,955
Gotta start getting
your strength back.

1694
02:28:54,080 --> 02:28:55,798
Where's Martha Jane?

1695
02:28:56,640 --> 02:28:58,710
She's outside pacing around.

1696
02:29:05,680 --> 02:29:06,999
Martha Jane?

1697
02:29:08,160 --> 02:29:10,116
You'd better come up now.

1698
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:26,797
Come on down to the kitchen
and get some food in you.

1699
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:31,390
You look about ready
to take sick yourself. Come on.

1700
02:29:32,200 --> 02:29:34,031
Martha Jane'll sit with her.

1701
02:30:04,320 --> 02:30:06,197
You take her, Jane.

1702
02:30:08,480 --> 02:30:12,553
- I'll hold her for you.
- No. You take her.

1703
02:30:12,960 --> 02:30:14,916
You raise her for me.

1704
02:30:16,480 --> 02:30:18,755
She's gonna need a good mother.

1705
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:35,753
Say you will.

1706
02:30:36,960 --> 02:30:38,757
I will.

1707
02:30:45,160 --> 02:30:47,435
You'd better go tell Blue.

1708
02:30:49,800 --> 02:30:51,074
Tell him what?

1709
02:30:53,240 --> 02:30:55,674
Just tell him yes.

1710
02:31:00,160 --> 02:31:01,639
I love you, Dora.

1711
02:31:03,640 --> 02:31:05,471
I know you do.

1712
02:31:46,280 --> 02:31:48,077
- Martha Jane.
- Blue.

1713
02:31:49,880 --> 02:31:52,030
You turn up in the darnedest places.

1714
02:31:52,160 --> 02:31:55,038
Never thought I'd see you
stringing wire.

1715
02:31:56,520 --> 02:32:00,229
Well, if you're looking for a job,
you're hired.

1716
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:05,839
I wish that's what I'd come for,
Blue.

1717
02:32:10,360 --> 02:32:12,237
Is everything alright with Dora?

1718
02:32:14,040 --> 02:32:15,871
She had a baby girl.

1719
02:32:18,280 --> 02:32:20,316
This time the baby lived.

1720
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:26,433
The baby lived?

1721
02:32:29,080 --> 02:32:30,513
She's beautiful.

1722
02:32:33,840 --> 02:32:35,193
Just like her mom?

1723
02:32:38,320 --> 02:32:40,151
Her eyes are blue.

1724
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:20,199
Dear Janey,

1725
02:33:20,320 --> 02:33:23,278
I'm sorry it's been so long
since I've written to you.

1726
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:27,879
After Dora died, I lacked the spirit
to take up my pencil.

1727
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:32,158
The baby is well and beautiful.

1728
02:33:33,880 --> 02:33:35,916
Bartle has gone into show business.

1729
02:33:36,040 --> 02:33:39,510
He plays in a melodrama,
a villain they call Black Bart.

1730
02:33:39,640 --> 02:33:43,792
He's married a redheaded actress
who bosses him something awful.

1731
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:45,751
But he don't seem to mind.

1732
02:33:48,120 --> 02:33:50,236
I try to stay put most times.

1733
02:33:50,960 --> 02:33:54,794
But, sometimes, I have to take
to wandering God's foothills.

1734
02:33:54,920 --> 02:33:56,592
The glorious Rocky Mountains.

1735
02:33:58,280 --> 02:34:02,876
In my mind, I still hear
Bartle and Jim argumentary as ever.

1736
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:08,470
Now and then, I'll come across
one lone buffalo or a beaver,

1737
02:34:08,600 --> 02:34:10,397
and it warms my heart.

1738
02:34:11,880 --> 02:34:16,476
But never a day goes by that I don't
miss my darling baby girl.

1739
02:34:17,440 --> 02:34:19,158
I'll always be your mother.

1740
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:21,558
Calamity Jane.

1741
02:34:30,059 --> 02:34:35,059
