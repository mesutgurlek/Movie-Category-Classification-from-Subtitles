1
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,512
Why did you come back?

2
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,143
Why did you come back?

3
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:49,296
The world keeps going
around and around,

4
00:01:49,331 --> 00:01:52,195
So you'll always end up
in the same place.

5
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,698
Then stay put.

6
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:59,668
They were never
really your people.

7
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:03,457
Even though you did
your part in their war,

8
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:06,501
.. and you won your medals.
Didn't you?

9
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,923
The only exist for mankind
is to fulfill his destiny.

10
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,301
why do you wanna change mine?

11
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,887
I didn't want, remember?

12
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,729
Mommy!

13
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,024
Mommy!

14
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:35,113
Mommy!

15
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:42,245
I changed destiny
when I decided that you alone..

16
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:46,500
.. to survive that useless massacre.

17
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:02,140
Or have you forgotten?

18
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,809
Oh you've never
been away so long.

19
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:09,189
Your memories will let you forget
the deaths that have to be paid.

20
00:03:09,224 --> 00:03:11,942
Aren't you tired of killing?

21
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,538
I have to survive!

22
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,833
Keoma!

23
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,045
Keoma!

24
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:55,235
Franco Nero in...

25
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:03,702
<b>KEOMA</b>

26
00:05:56,397 --> 00:06:00,151
Don't touch me Liza!
You're still clean.

27
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,280
You have to save the baby,
You gotta be through with touching me.

28
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,658
What difference does it make?

29
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:11,996
Where they're taking us,
I'm bound to catch it, sooner or later.

30
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,463
Instead of dragging away the dire*,
why don't we kill 'em right here?

31
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,508
Haven't you ever heard of
Christian charity?

32
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,845
When I'm trying to attract
their attention, jump off and hide.

33
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,223
But "Mat", you can't!

34
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,724
-They'll only kill..
-Sh..sh..sh..

35
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,561
Just get ready to act... fast.

36
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,356
One of them is legging
a break forward!

37
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:41,067
Stop him! Stop him!

38
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,453
No! No!

39
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:33,202
See how you like this, sweetheart!

40
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,067
Don't touch her!
She's got the plague.

41
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,922
You mind your own
business, stranger!

42
00:08:05,957 --> 00:08:07,737
We're taking another
to the old mine,

43
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:11,491
Where the others are.
It's the best place for 'em.

44
00:08:11,526 --> 00:08:14,077
Anyone who tries
to run away gets shot.

45
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,543
That's orders.

46
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:19,373
Why if anyone of them's got back,
they could infect the whole town.

47
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,462
I never liked people
who talk too much.

48
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,510
Get off your horse!

49
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,432
I said, get off your horse!

50
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,164
Jane! That's isn't clean* enough.

51
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:02,161
Put some line*.
Come on, move, higher, higher...

52
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:05,122
Not like that.
Like this, like this,...

53
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:29,271
Hey, mister!
Come on over, and join the fun.

54
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,649
There's everything here
come Wiskey you'll love it.

55
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,943
We can all what
she's gonna do a man.

56
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,821
The town is a dying up flies.

57
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,071
Give us something to drink.

58
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:21,907
Hey..
Hey, that's Farrow's wife.

59
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,159
What the hell is SHE doing here?

60
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,538
She has got the plague.
Oh my God, gather around!

61
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,957
Don't touch,
She's got the plague!

62
00:12:29,992 --> 00:12:32,334
Throw her out!
Before we all get it.

63
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,920
I told you to give us
something to drink.

64
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,884
You get that woman,
out of here!

65
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,519
The lady's with me.

66
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,861
Drop it!

67
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,607
And now, unloaded!

68
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,616
You forgot one.

69
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,427
The lady will have
dinner in her room.

70
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,638
But, we don't have
any room, sir!

71
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,015
They're all taken.

72
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,289
You...

73
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:41,463
-Your room number?
-Number seven

74
00:14:41,498 --> 00:14:45,509
-Get the key!
-But...

75
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:41,356
He's trying to get away.

76
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,276
Help with the back,
hurry up, cut him off.

77
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:49,239
Hurry up!
Get him! Get him!

78
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,208
There he goes.
Come on, go after him!

79
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:15,474
What's happened to this town?

80
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:18,352
How did you get like this?

81
00:16:22,397 --> 00:16:27,069
It was... just after the war.

82
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:32,824
With all those
ex-soldiers came to town.

83
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:35,952
They would led by this Caldwell.

84
00:16:36,536 --> 00:16:40,040
He bought the mine.
Then, little by little, whole town.

85
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,584
He forced people to sell.

86
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,796
Using any method he could.

87
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,260
Then the plague began...

88
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:54,721
Because of the poluted wells.

89
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,265
Now Caldwell won't let
anyone leave town..

90
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,351
.. unless they're
sick or dying.

91
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,230
Why are you helping me?

92
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,861
We all have the right to be born.

93
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:08,128
Your shootings are good..

94
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,213
.. at the dead.

95
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:19,973
Let's go boys! Go!

96
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,597
George!

97
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:11,566
Say that again!

98
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:21,576
George.

99
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,794
I haven't heard that
for a long time.

100
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,422
I almost forgot
what it sounded like.

101
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,759
What happened to your bow?

102
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,682
They went like all the things
have belonged to a drunk.

103
00:19:43,723 --> 00:19:45,892
I hocked it for some booze.

104
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,729
But you were
never drinking man!

105
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:55,742
Yeah, that's right.
I know that.

106
00:19:55,777 --> 00:20:00,156
I used to have something
to hope for: My freedom.

107
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,951
That was a long time ago.

108
00:20:02,992 --> 00:20:06,413
Now the war is over.
Now you've got your freedom.

109
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,541
I found out what it was worth.

110
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,796
That's why I drink.

111
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,513
George, who is Caldwell?

112
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,857
Do you remember that?

113
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:37,318
Sounds different.

114
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,093
I ain't got but three strings.

115
00:20:41,128 --> 00:20:43,741
I'm waiting for them to bust.

116
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,162
And kneel with them.

117
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,246
You said there was a man,
caused a trouble down the saloon?

118
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,123
That's right, Mr. Caldwell.

119
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,709
Well, tell me
more about it, Slade.

120
00:21:36,502 --> 00:21:40,256
He shot Ben and Charlie,
without even turning around.

121
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:42,550
Don't talk balderdash, man.

122
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:46,054
There ain't nobody can hit a target
without looking at it.

123
00:21:46,554 --> 00:21:48,806
-Without looking at it?
-You're right!

124
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:51,643
There are two men who can.

125
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:56,564
Our Pa is one,
and the other is...

126
00:23:24,902 --> 00:23:30,700
-You have part of my offend, Keoma!
-Yeah we're gonna get you.

127
00:23:42,962 --> 00:23:45,548
Little bastard Indian!

128
00:23:59,061 --> 00:24:02,815
Hey, boys!
Launch is ready.

129
00:24:23,586 --> 00:24:25,963
C'mon in, Keoma!

130
00:24:27,173 --> 00:24:29,508
Aren't you hungry?

131
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:35,932
Come on in!

132
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:40,144
Well, you gotta
stand there all the day?

133
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:47,193
C'mon in!

134
00:24:56,452 --> 00:24:58,871
Welcome home, son!

135
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,672
You've been gone
quite a while this time.

136
00:25:07,713 --> 00:25:09,382
Where have you been?

137
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:12,218
Fighting at war.

138
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:14,595
You winned it or lose it?

139
00:25:15,304 --> 00:25:18,349
I just happened to be
in the winning side.

140
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:23,980
-Did you see anybody faster than you?
-Not yet!

141
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,275
Maybe I never will.

142
00:25:30,152 --> 00:25:33,489
C'mon over here,
you over-grown Pappous.

143
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,964
What's with the town?
What's going on there?

144
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:52,508
I say there won't be no town.

145
00:25:52,591 --> 00:25:55,970
They are like guns,
won't defend themselves.

146
00:25:56,012 --> 00:26:00,474
-Won't fight back.
-How about my half-brothers?

147
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,978
The boys chose the side
of the strongest.

148
00:26:04,013 --> 00:26:05,955
I can't blame them for that.

149
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,898
And who is the strongest?

150
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,483
Caldwell.

151
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:12,361
You used to be the strongest.

152
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:16,949
The fastest.
I used to be the fastest.

153
00:26:18,325 --> 00:26:20,536
That's not the strongest.

154
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,164
This means you'll
live a little longer.

155
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:26,716
Don't need you ride either.

156
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,086
I have lived long enough
to find out how wrong..

157
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:33,215
.. I was about...
so many things.

158
00:26:36,343 --> 00:26:38,637
The great Shannon

159
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,896
I saw George.

160
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,440
Hmm..
Did you?

161
00:26:54,236 --> 00:26:56,363
Pa?

162
00:26:57,364 --> 00:27:01,744
-What was it all about?
-What?

163
00:27:02,244 --> 00:27:05,873
The war.
I never could figure it out.

164
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:11,003
The war.
Not sure I know.

165
00:27:13,672 --> 00:27:16,884
I figured after we got through
slogering all the Indians..

166
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:20,221
.. we thought we gotta
do something.. generous.

167
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,558
Thought we get the freedom
to the black man.

168
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:30,189
Now we here are good. We're
going back to.. end itch off the Indians.

169
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,617
You've been in love, yet?

170
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,997
Not as much as you.

171
00:27:48,415 --> 00:27:50,626
Well...

172
00:27:51,502 --> 00:27:53,712
Yeah...

173
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:58,467
She was quite a woman.

174
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:03,430
You must be very lonely.

175
00:28:04,306 --> 00:28:07,434
You know what it is,
you're searching for?

176
00:28:10,437 --> 00:28:12,940
Myself, I guess.
I don't know.

177
00:28:14,858 --> 00:28:17,152
I need to find out who I am.

178
00:28:17,486 --> 00:28:20,614
To be the simplest of
my actions or result.

179
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:24,243
I know my being in this world
has something of significance.

180
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:28,163
But I'm affraid when I find out
what it is, to be too late.

181
00:28:28,956 --> 00:28:31,458
In the meantime, I'm a vaguer.

182
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:37,673
I keep travelling. Even when
the Earth sleeps I keep travelling.

183
00:28:38,257 --> 00:28:41,176
Chasing shadows.

184
00:28:42,052 --> 00:28:44,888
I think that's the way you have
gone when your mother died.

185
00:28:45,305 --> 00:28:47,641
When you were away.

186
00:28:49,852 --> 00:28:53,689
I'd like to do something, Keoma.

187
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,986
You know, that's funny,
whole my life I've looked to death.

188
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,071
Looked him straight in the eye.

189
00:29:01,196 --> 00:29:03,407
I was never affraid.

190
00:29:03,699 --> 00:29:05,200
Now I'm old.

191
00:29:05,576 --> 00:29:07,995
Dying slowly.

192
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:11,874
I wanna live

193
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:15,502
I'm affraid.

194
00:29:19,131 --> 00:29:21,550
What should I do?

195
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,560
I can't shoot it
out of my own sons.

196
00:29:46,116 --> 00:29:50,871
<i>Come on, beast. Gather around here!
Get her out of here. Throw her out!</i>

197
00:29:50,954 --> 00:29:52,122
Right out, right out!

198
00:29:52,414 --> 00:29:55,896
Don't let her touch anything.
Keep her off the furniture.

199
00:29:55,931 --> 00:29:58,656
We don't wanna get infected.
You better use your sister's.

200
00:29:58,691 --> 00:30:01,381
-What am I gonna do?
-Don't wanna get infected by you.

201
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:03,133
I have to burn everything
I have in my room.

202
00:30:03,175 --> 00:30:04,927
Get out all of you.

203
00:30:05,093 --> 00:30:07,429
<i>For God's sake throw her out,
</i>

204
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:10,724
Well, well...
Look who's here!

205
00:30:10,766 --> 00:30:14,102
If that ain't our little lady friend.

206
00:30:15,562 --> 00:30:18,482
Hey, what happened
to your shepheroo?

207
00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:23,820
Don't tell me
the honey moon is over!

208
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:25,871
Move! Come on!

209
00:30:25,906 --> 00:30:27,783
Whait a minute,
who's gonna pay me back!

210
00:30:37,251 --> 00:30:40,420
Nigger, you shouldn't step
on my path like that.

211
00:30:40,879 --> 00:30:45,092
That was a dumb thing to do.
You're leaving your stinking around.

212
00:30:45,384 --> 00:30:47,928
I've just gotta clean it up.

213
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,974
<i>But I could;
but it was too many of them.</i>

214
00:31:34,266 --> 00:31:36,393
She didn't have a chance
with a scum like me.

215
00:31:36,435 --> 00:31:38,729
I can hardly defend myself.

216
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,939
They said it was Caldwell.

217
00:31:41,064 --> 00:31:43,775
Caldwell?
Where is she now?

218
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,612
I tried,
God knows I tried.

219
00:31:47,738 --> 00:31:50,032
Where did they take her?

220
00:31:50,115 --> 00:31:52,492
Where did they
take her, "nigger"?

221
00:31:53,452 --> 00:31:56,246
They said something
about the old mine.

222
00:31:56,288 --> 00:31:58,248
Where the sick people are.

223
00:32:02,502 --> 00:32:05,005
George, I didn't mean it!

224
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,983
Slade, Chuck! Find her.

225
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:15,260
It's no use.
You can't save her.

226
00:34:34,362 --> 00:34:38,325
Hey lady! We wanna
talk to you. Come on out!

227
00:34:38,658 --> 00:34:40,952
You're deaf?

228
00:34:41,411 --> 00:34:45,081
Come on out, if you don't want me
to do something I might regret.

229
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:48,668
We have found her.

230
00:35:04,934 --> 00:35:08,688
What's the name of the man
who took you too the saloon?

231
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:14,569
Tell me his name.

232
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:23,161
You wanna die?

233
00:35:26,748 --> 00:35:28,750
You got pain?
What's his name?

234
00:35:29,292 --> 00:35:32,504
I don't know!
He never told me.

235
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,964
This is true, I promise you.

236
00:35:36,091 --> 00:35:38,384
I don't believe you lady.

237
00:35:39,385 --> 00:35:41,137
This is your last chan..

238
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:43,032
This is my son, George!

239
00:36:46,202 --> 00:36:48,621
My dear brothers.

240
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:55,461
-Butch.
-Sam,

241
00:36:57,422 --> 00:36:59,549
Lenny.

242
00:37:04,345 --> 00:37:06,472
Three names..

243
00:37:07,307 --> 00:37:09,475
.. one brand.

244
00:37:12,478 --> 00:37:15,106
There is no use,
hiding your faces.

245
00:37:15,898 --> 00:37:18,568
It won't change
the way you behave.

246
00:37:21,904 --> 00:37:24,198
It's been a long time.

247
00:37:25,366 --> 00:37:27,660
But you haven't changed a bit.

248
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:31,254
Why don't you
get out of here?

249
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:33,374
You're will be never
welcomed in our family.

250
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:35,668
You don't have to rush it.

251
00:37:37,128 --> 00:37:40,173
Our half-brother knows
how to run away..

252
00:37:40,298 --> 00:37:42,592
.. when he feels like it.

253
00:37:50,016 --> 00:37:52,310
That's enough with that.

254
00:37:54,145 --> 00:37:56,564
Forget your family's quarrels.

255
00:37:57,649 --> 00:38:01,736
These poor people,
made these an accomodation.

256
00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:03,946
I don't have food to sustain them.

257
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:05,621
That is up to us.

258
00:38:05,656 --> 00:38:09,751
There are neigbours.
They're saying that they get it.

259
00:38:09,786 --> 00:38:13,039
But 'cos the rest of the world is
ignored them with the plague..

260
00:38:13,074 --> 00:38:14,832
.. raging the murders.

261
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:17,335
But if we give them
a brotherly hand,

262
00:38:17,502 --> 00:38:20,046
We can overcome this crisis.

263
00:38:22,465 --> 00:38:27,595
Will you join us?
I'll pay you well.

264
00:38:28,137 --> 00:38:30,390
You'll pay, don't worry.

265
00:38:31,391 --> 00:38:33,726
And my price is high.

266
00:38:34,352 --> 00:38:36,145
We'll see.

267
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:54,580
Go away, stranger!

268
00:38:58,668 --> 00:39:03,131
Don't try to help us.
We're already dead.

269
00:39:03,256 --> 00:39:06,050
But, you're still affraid?
That hasn't changed that?

270
00:39:06,092 --> 00:39:08,719
It's not for ourselves,
it's for our wives and children,

271
00:39:08,803 --> 00:39:11,931
And the town,
for we'd infect it.

272
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:15,017
But if we rebel,
or if you're trying to help us,

273
00:39:15,434 --> 00:39:17,728
Caldwell will take it out on them.

274
00:39:17,895 --> 00:39:20,314
It's said,
for coward people like you,

275
00:39:20,439 --> 00:39:22,900
That bastards,
like Caldwell will going on living.

276
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:30,384
Keoma, I had to warn you.
You can't take her back to town.

277
00:40:30,468 --> 00:40:32,970
The town is surrounded.

278
00:40:34,263 --> 00:40:38,309
-She needs a doctor.
-Can't do it alone.

279
00:40:38,893 --> 00:40:42,897
I have to do it alone.
Because I am alone.

280
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:52,031
This is my son, George!
This is your new family.

281
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:56,202
-Why did he come back
-What does he expect to proof?

282
00:40:56,237 --> 00:40:58,711
That nothing's changed between us?

283
00:40:58,746 --> 00:41:01,874
That he can stand our way like
he's done ever since we were kids?

284
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:04,335
Well, let me tell ye, Pa!
He won't.

285
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,463
Times are different now.
Times are changed around here.

286
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,632
He's been away too long.

287
00:41:09,715 --> 00:41:11,842
And the only thing
that's keeping us..

288
00:41:11,884 --> 00:41:15,971
.. from sinkin' a bullet to his head,
is our respect for you.

289
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:20,226
You gotta put a stop
into Shannonigans.

290
00:41:24,438 --> 00:41:26,941
Are you that much
affraid of Keoma?

291
00:41:29,568 --> 00:41:32,029
Or are you affraid of what
Caldwell will gonna think of you?

292
00:41:32,071 --> 00:41:34,907
Hell no, but you never
give us a chance Pa.

293
00:41:34,949 --> 00:41:37,368
You are too busy caring
for that half-breed.

294
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:39,578
You haven't any time for us.

295
00:41:39,662 --> 00:41:42,998
You've never gave us
the affection you gave to him.

296
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:46,419
For God's sake
we're your real sons.

297
00:41:50,256 --> 00:41:52,883
Real sons?

298
00:41:53,467 --> 00:41:55,970
All of you are my sons.

299
00:41:56,762 --> 00:41:59,932
Since has never been any
difference, you made a difference.

300
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:04,353
This is it home. You can
come and go as your pleases.

301
00:42:04,603 --> 00:42:06,153
And joking, you!

302
00:42:06,188 --> 00:42:10,609
You can come and you
can go to hell as your please.

303
00:42:18,617 --> 00:42:20,251
We'll catch this son-of-a-bitch
sooner or later.

304
00:42:20,286 --> 00:42:24,248
Yeah. I hate to be in his boots,
when Caldwell's got a hold of him.

305
00:42:24,373 --> 00:42:27,543
He don't deserve no better.
He's only a goddamn Indian.

306
00:42:27,751 --> 00:42:30,045
That Caldwell is a mean man.

307
00:42:32,256 --> 00:42:36,719
Hey, nigger! This time's better
off without that gut-puked.

308
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,888
I guess he ain't had
enough to drink yet today.

309
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:40,104
Yeah, you're right.

310
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:42,725
When he gets skinful,
he plays really cheerful.

311
00:42:57,615 --> 00:43:00,534
-George?
-Yes, it's me.

312
00:43:10,127 --> 00:43:12,212
This isn't the time yet.
The few more days.

313
00:43:12,247 --> 00:43:14,465
Otherwise she's in perfect health.

314
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:18,677
Nothing's wrong with her.
All she needsd now is rest.

315
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:21,639
You can take her away.
There's nobody outside.

316
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,807
Good!

317
00:43:31,523 --> 00:43:34,068
-She's staying here.
-She's sta.. oh, no no!

318
00:43:34,103 --> 00:43:35,326
That's impossible.

319
00:43:35,361 --> 00:43:38,322
She can't stay here.
If they find out,

320
00:43:38,357 --> 00:43:40,407
It will be all over for us.

321
00:43:42,743 --> 00:43:45,663
How much's Caldwell paying you
not to treat the plague victims?

322
00:43:45,704 --> 00:43:49,458
Oh, how dare you to say that?
I do all I can.

323
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:54,588
It won't be all the matter of medicines
or contact the authorities.

324
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:59,218
Caldwell is gambling at anyone
at the town, unless they're dead.

325
00:43:59,301 --> 00:44:02,012
How am I going to
fight them? Alone?

326
00:44:02,262 --> 00:44:05,015
And there's my wife.
I have to think of her.

327
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,392
She's the only thing I got.

328
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:10,354
No no no, I don't wanna
be mixed up in this.

329
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:14,108
So you just give up in
by inch by inch.

330
00:44:14,733 --> 00:44:17,861
But if you feel like that
it might as well be that now.

331
00:44:20,364 --> 00:44:23,283
What's happened to you, George?

332
00:44:24,201 --> 00:44:26,704
I used to admire you so much.

333
00:44:27,329 --> 00:44:30,165
I have never forgotten
the lessons you taught me.

334
00:44:30,374 --> 00:44:32,668
You were my idol.

335
00:44:32,835 --> 00:44:35,504
You were the black man
and I, the half-Indian.

336
00:44:35,963 --> 00:44:39,717
I learned from you that the color of
man's skin doesn't make any difference.

337
00:44:40,092 --> 00:44:42,803
And those days you were
never affraid of anything.

338
00:44:42,928 --> 00:44:45,431
From a wild-cat to a grizzly bear.

339
00:44:45,472 --> 00:44:49,643
And you could duel any man in town
with one hand behind your back.

340
00:44:52,312 --> 00:44:54,606
And now, look at you!

341
00:44:56,483 --> 00:44:58,986
Both of you.
Two cowards.

342
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:07,536
What do we have to do?

343
00:45:11,081 --> 00:45:16,044
Get out of town. Inform the authorities
and bring back medical supplies.

344
00:45:16,086 --> 00:45:18,046
But, how?

345
00:45:18,797 --> 00:45:21,049
You've already said it.

346
00:45:21,467 --> 00:45:23,844
We'll go like the date.

347
00:45:24,094 --> 00:45:28,265
-Alright, George.
-Why are you helping us?

348
00:45:28,307 --> 00:45:30,601
Who are you doing it for?

349
00:45:33,979 --> 00:45:36,064
For myself maybe.

350
00:45:51,914 --> 00:45:54,041
George!

351
00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:25,614
-Where is he?
-Where's that son-of-a-bitch hiding?

352
00:46:26,114 --> 00:46:28,200
Talk!

353
00:46:54,184 --> 00:46:56,979
Are you looking for me?

354
00:47:20,919 --> 00:47:23,588
We told you to
keep the head out of here.

355
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:26,383
So how come you're still here?

356
00:47:27,092 --> 00:47:29,594
Why don't you go hunt buffalo?

357
00:47:29,928 --> 00:47:32,097
Now get going!

358
00:47:32,389 --> 00:47:34,683
You miserable little bastard!

359
00:47:34,808 --> 00:47:37,227
You scum!
You no good half-breed.

360
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:40,939
Get lost, hey Keoma!

361
00:47:41,732 --> 00:47:44,943
-Half-breed!
-Bastard Indian!

362
00:47:44,985 --> 00:47:47,112
Filthy animal!

363
00:47:47,154 --> 00:47:49,614
What's it gonna be?
Three against one?

364
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:53,910
-Like the old days?
-I can beat you by myself.

365
00:49:13,823 --> 00:49:17,452
Your gun.
Mine's over there.

366
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:32,092
Won't you get up?

367
00:49:34,511 --> 00:49:38,390
What's the matter, Indian?
You don't look like you feel so good.

368
00:49:38,515 --> 00:49:41,434
See what heppens when you
go picking up fight?

369
00:49:41,726 --> 00:49:44,145
It ain't healthy.

370
00:49:50,485 --> 00:49:52,988
Hey, hey!

371
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:56,449
Are you dead?

372
00:50:54,007 --> 00:50:56,301
Haven't you had enough?

373
00:51:03,725 --> 00:51:06,478
You ain't no match for me, Keoma!

374
00:51:08,855 --> 00:51:11,357
But if you want me to hurt you..

375
00:51:58,446 --> 00:52:00,573
Lenny!

376
00:53:20,403 --> 00:53:23,614
-What have you got in there?
-Nothing much.

377
00:53:23,781 --> 00:53:26,541
Just annother victim
of the plague. A nigger.

378
00:53:26,576 --> 00:53:30,705
There's only one nigger in the town.
He is with his fiddle.

379
00:53:30,788 --> 00:53:33,124
George, I saw him
a little while ago.

380
00:53:33,666 --> 00:53:35,584
-Check the wagon.
-Go ahead...

381
00:53:35,619 --> 00:53:37,468
Look at the state is he now.

382
00:53:37,503 --> 00:53:39,922
Get it at an empty bottle of Wiskey.

383
00:53:40,381 --> 00:53:42,508
Eww.. he's disgusting.

384
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,387
-I told you
-Get him out of here.

385
00:53:46,422 --> 00:53:49,390
Yeah, It'd be my pleasure.

386
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,784
George!
You can come back to life now.

387
00:54:08,201 --> 00:54:10,369
The coast is clear.

388
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:15,208
Hey doc! We sure fooled them, ha?

389
00:54:15,416 --> 00:54:20,630
Not yet. Don't be forgetting.
We got to make it back.

390
00:54:20,963 --> 00:54:23,841
Come on!
Get me those reins.

391
00:54:25,343 --> 00:54:27,887
The three Shannons.

392
00:54:31,933 --> 00:54:34,852
The terrors of the west.

393
00:54:37,146 --> 00:54:40,650
And you think you go inherit
the legend of your father.

394
00:54:44,612 --> 00:54:49,158
Why you three yellow-belly cowards
couldn't even take care of one half-breed?

395
00:54:49,575 --> 00:54:52,203
He wiped the countryside with you.

396
00:54:54,497 --> 00:54:56,791
And you wanted to join up with me,

397
00:54:56,874 --> 00:54:59,585
Be my partners.

398
00:54:59,835 --> 00:55:02,797
Why, I'd rather team up
with a bunch of old women.

399
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:06,008
They're right, with alikes like you.

400
00:55:07,468 --> 00:55:10,638
I'll ride into town,
and handle this my way.

401
00:55:14,767 --> 00:55:17,353
Meantime, why don't you
run home to your Pappy,

402
00:55:17,388 --> 00:55:19,278
And let HIM take care of you?

403
00:55:19,313 --> 00:55:22,525
Before you really
get into some trouble?

404
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:33,578
Let's go!

405
00:56:14,327 --> 00:56:17,997
Search every house!
Get everybody out in the street!

406
00:56:40,436 --> 00:56:42,730
They're searching for us.

407
00:56:48,652 --> 00:56:51,155
We go, have the back.

408
00:57:05,211 --> 00:57:06,260
Okay, where is he, lady?

409
00:57:06,295 --> 00:57:08,610
How dare you breaking in
my house like this?

410
00:57:08,645 --> 00:57:10,925
Who do you think you are?
Get out of here!

411
00:57:12,301 --> 00:57:14,637
-Where do I find your husband?
-How should I know?

412
00:57:14,678 --> 00:57:18,224
If you do find him, you tell him
to bother coming home when all it's over.

413
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:20,149
<i>Slow down looking at here.</i>

414
00:57:20,184 --> 00:57:22,561
<i>I'm going right back
and check out these houses here.</i>

415
00:57:22,686 --> 00:57:26,232
<i>Alright, hurry up!
That was them running here.</i>

416
00:57:26,482 --> 00:57:30,069
<i>-How about over there?
-Ok, I'll go back and check it.</i>

417
00:57:30,194 --> 00:57:32,488
<i>Why are you on here?
Go get stable.</i>

418
00:57:35,699 --> 00:57:38,410
<i>-Not even a chase?
-No!</i>

419
00:57:48,128 --> 00:57:51,090
Gotta be here, somewhere.
Go find him!

420
00:58:00,057 --> 00:58:02,184
Halt!

421
00:58:32,965 --> 00:58:36,176
Come on, get the hell outta here.
Gates look and go, over there.

422
00:58:41,724 --> 00:58:44,184
Come on, come on!

423
00:58:46,604 --> 00:58:49,023
Hey, what's the matter with Billie?

424
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:52,776
Tank passed his neck, find him!

425
01:00:10,479 --> 01:00:12,606
Stand up!

426
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:19,113
Nice and easy now!

427
01:00:21,156 --> 01:00:24,076
Well, well...
Look who I've found.

428
01:00:38,674 --> 01:00:39,758
This way.

429
01:01:26,054 --> 01:01:28,223
She's sleeping.

430
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,703
Take care of her!

431
01:01:52,539 --> 01:01:54,666
Keoma!

432
01:01:55,542 --> 01:01:58,670
Keep yourself look up behind you!

433
01:02:18,857 --> 01:02:21,485
Well look who it is,
it's the undertaker.

434
01:02:21,693 --> 01:02:23,570
I'm just doing my duty
to the town's folks.

435
01:02:23,605 --> 01:02:25,412
Taking care of them
from cradle to the grave.

436
01:02:25,447 --> 01:02:31,495
It's torture doc! I don't know what'll
those get paintless do without you.

437
01:02:31,787 --> 01:02:35,040
The next thing you don't know,
is how to smuggling medicines.

438
01:02:36,208 --> 01:02:40,420
We made it, George!
We made it. It's easy going from now on.

439
01:02:50,555 --> 01:02:52,057
Hey everybody!

440
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:55,685
We've got the medicine.
We've got the medicine!

441
01:02:56,561 --> 01:02:59,272
Al, Jake! Go and get your Wives.

442
01:02:59,689 --> 01:03:01,983
We've got the medicine!

443
01:03:02,526 --> 01:03:05,320
We can stop the plague now.

444
01:03:06,113 --> 01:03:08,865
Come on, we finally got
the medicine we need.

445
01:03:09,074 --> 01:03:13,787
-And we got food too.
-Come and get what you need.

446
01:03:13,822 --> 01:03:16,790
You're gonna be alright, come!

447
01:03:37,144 --> 01:03:40,897
We've got some medicine,
and food!

448
01:03:41,439 --> 01:03:43,817
And the authorities
are gonna send more.

449
01:03:45,443 --> 01:03:48,488
And another thing.
They're sending a federal Marshall.

450
01:03:48,613 --> 01:03:49,990
Oh, thank God!

451
01:03:51,324 --> 01:03:53,076
Can't believe it!

452
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,996
Won't be any good, lady!

453
01:03:56,329 --> 01:04:01,585
Hey, see you finally found the chance
to be here all, ha? Good for you.

454
01:04:01,877 --> 01:04:04,379
Go on unload then, doc!

455
01:04:05,088 --> 01:04:08,008
-But these are only medicines.
-I don't give a damn.

456
01:04:08,133 --> 01:04:11,678
This land belongs to Mr. Caldwell.

457
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,222
Along with everything that's on it.

458
01:04:14,389 --> 01:04:19,394
Now that you had to pay for the water,
and now you gotta pay for medicine.

459
01:04:21,521 --> 01:04:23,273
Hey!

460
01:04:26,776 --> 01:04:29,070
I'll pay this time.

461
01:04:29,195 --> 01:04:31,573
How much you're willing to pay?

462
01:04:32,032 --> 01:04:34,826
Four cents.

463
01:04:35,452 --> 01:04:37,579
Four cents is mighty little.

464
01:04:39,122 --> 01:04:41,625
The price of four bullets.

465
01:04:42,459 --> 01:04:44,586
One,

466
01:04:45,337 --> 01:04:47,464
Two,

467
01:04:47,923 --> 01:04:50,050
Three,

468
01:04:51,468 --> 01:04:53,595
And four.

469
01:05:21,873 --> 01:05:24,125
Take it.

470
01:05:27,629 --> 01:05:29,964
That's your name on it.

471
01:05:32,717 --> 01:05:36,680
Now go tell Caldwell
that I'm waiting here for him.

472
01:05:40,475 --> 01:05:42,727
Waiting for me, ha?

473
01:05:43,436 --> 01:05:47,190
Well, that's the last time
he's gonna have to wait.

474
01:05:51,986 --> 01:05:54,280
Come on out!

475
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:59,411
I think it's about time
we got rid of Caldwell.

476
01:05:59,577 --> 01:06:03,331
Get rid of him?
That would be a big mistake.

477
01:06:03,498 --> 01:06:05,500
Right now he's the one
we need the most.

478
01:06:05,535 --> 01:06:07,502
Come on, Butch,
what are you talking about?

479
01:06:07,537 --> 01:06:09,344
What the hell do we need him for?

480
01:06:09,379 --> 01:06:13,550
I figured, if Keoma
doesn't get to him first,

481
01:06:13,675 --> 01:06:18,054
Mr. Caldwell's gonna
make us a fine executioner.

482
01:06:20,014 --> 01:06:22,934
Executioner?
Who, Caldwell?

483
01:06:22,969 --> 01:06:24,227
Yeah!

484
01:06:24,477 --> 01:06:27,939
We got a chance to kill
two birds with one stone.

485
01:06:28,231 --> 01:06:30,365
We play our cards right.

486
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,368
Keoma and Caldwell
will kill each other.

487
01:06:33,403 --> 01:06:37,115
And that's gonna leave the town
temporarily without a leader.

488
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:40,702
And then?

489
01:06:41,035 --> 01:06:43,711
Well, nothing's gotta stop us.

490
01:06:43,746 --> 01:06:46,541
We'll then end taking
tight control of the town.

491
01:06:46,666 --> 01:06:49,169
Running it anywhere
with time we'll want.

492
01:07:15,987 --> 01:07:19,073
Now let's go to see what
that two birds are doing.

493
01:07:47,977 --> 01:07:50,480
Let me through!
My son's ill.

494
01:07:50,688 --> 01:07:52,941
Please, please let me through!

495
01:07:53,107 --> 01:07:55,944
He's quite alright. Take him away.
Nothing's wrong with him.

496
01:07:55,985 --> 01:07:59,280
-Who's next?
-See Mr. Abel, just this and be good.

497
01:07:59,405 --> 01:08:02,367
Ok, you take two of these,
three times a day. Alright?

498
01:08:02,909 --> 01:08:05,453
Hey, come on, what are you doing?
It's too early for this. It's all scheduled.

499
01:08:05,578 --> 01:08:08,623
Everything's gonna be alright.
You'll see it.

500
01:08:10,708 --> 01:08:14,963
Caldwell's coming. Everybody
go home, and stay out of sight.

501
01:08:15,046 --> 01:08:17,298
Go on, hurry, hurry!

502
01:10:32,183 --> 01:10:36,646
Alright friends, he's right out.
Bring me that goddamn half-breed.

503
01:10:41,692 --> 01:10:44,237
Alright Keoma,
come on out!

504
01:10:44,695 --> 01:10:47,031
You can't hold all
against us alone.

505
01:10:47,156 --> 01:10:49,492
You're wrong, Caldwell.

506
01:10:54,997 --> 01:10:57,249
He's not alone.

507
01:10:57,333 --> 01:11:00,044
Wolf, take your platoon,
and flush 'em out.

508
01:12:40,186 --> 01:12:42,730
Just like old times, Mr. Shannon!

509
01:12:43,647 --> 01:12:46,150
Welcome back, George!

510
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,574
It's good to be back.

511
01:14:14,738 --> 01:14:17,366
What are you waiting for?
Go get him!

512
01:14:18,575 --> 01:14:23,789
That lousy hair flees, making fools
out of your blundering, ain't it?

513
01:15:05,789 --> 01:15:07,916
Hold it!

514
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:08,889
Sorry, there ain't
no name on this bullet.

515
01:18:42,214 --> 01:18:45,759
Half-breed!
Come on down out of there.

516
01:18:47,302 --> 01:18:49,888
Or I'll blow out his head off

517
01:19:32,889 --> 01:19:34,224
No!

518
01:19:34,849 --> 01:19:36,309
No, Keoma!

519
01:19:37,394 --> 01:19:38,353
No!

520
01:23:04,976 --> 01:23:11,816
Now you see what happens,
to anyone who gets in my way?

521
01:23:12,025 --> 01:23:14,152
Caldwell!

522
01:23:27,707 --> 01:23:30,293
You shouldn't have
done that, Caldwell.

523
01:23:30,543 --> 01:23:34,547
I'm sorry boys.
That was nothing I could do.

524
01:23:35,214 --> 01:23:36,681
You see,

525
01:23:36,716 --> 01:23:41,304
He turned against us.
He turned against me,

526
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:43,973
And against you.

527
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:47,560
He was helping that Indian.

528
01:23:49,228 --> 01:23:52,357
Remember how we've done with
the traitors in the war?

529
01:23:54,108 --> 01:23:56,694
We shot 'em like dogs.

530
01:26:14,749 --> 01:26:18,294
Here lies,
William H. Shannon.

531
01:26:19,128 --> 01:26:22,006
The man we all
loved and admired.

532
01:26:22,089 --> 01:26:25,426
A very special sort of man.

533
01:26:25,968 --> 01:26:30,264
There was no person on earth he refused
to help with when they needed it.

534
01:26:30,299 --> 01:26:33,851
Not one person who
would have betrayed him.

535
01:26:34,435 --> 01:26:36,979
Except the one
he gave his love to.

536
01:26:37,063 --> 01:26:39,190
His bastard son.

537
01:26:39,273 --> 01:26:43,027
We learned from father
to respect law and justice.

538
01:26:43,194 --> 01:26:45,821
But you didn't.

539
01:26:47,031 --> 01:26:49,950
Only filled with
sell out his own father.

540
01:26:50,493 --> 01:26:55,081
But died alone. It's not
the extent of his guilt.

541
01:26:55,539 --> 01:26:59,794
He betraid us all when he brought back
that plagued woman to infect us.

542
01:26:59,835 --> 01:27:02,338
How far can a man sink?

543
01:27:02,421 --> 01:27:06,175
He betrayed his father.
He betrayed us,

544
01:27:06,342 --> 01:27:10,721
And he betrayed each and
every one of you, my friends.

545
01:27:11,722 --> 01:27:14,517
Keoma is responsible with
the death of your loved ones.

546
01:27:14,725 --> 01:27:17,353
He has brought this
despair to this town.

547
01:27:17,812 --> 01:27:20,731
So now...
what should we do with him?

548
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:23,109
Take the law on our own hands?

549
01:27:23,192 --> 01:27:27,113
Drag him to the nearest tree and
straight him up like he deserves?

550
01:27:27,279 --> 01:27:29,407
No...

551
01:27:29,949 --> 01:27:32,368
For we're honorable men.

552
01:27:32,618 --> 01:27:37,623
And prefer like justice.
Take it to courts.

553
01:27:38,332 --> 01:27:44,171
As it should have done with this
venomous snake, in a court of law.

554
01:27:45,756 --> 01:27:50,261
We already called the Marshall.
He'll be here in few hours.

555
01:27:50,427 --> 01:27:54,181
And then Keoma will be...
HIS problem.

556
01:27:54,306 --> 01:27:57,393
And as soon as my brother is here,
and he's more than a sherriff,

557
01:27:57,434 --> 01:27:59,395
All we start rebuilding around here.

558
01:27:59,854 --> 01:28:02,106
Like this kind of place
we can be proud of.

559
01:28:02,439 --> 01:28:04,733
Where it takes, Sam!

560
01:28:11,115 --> 01:28:12,373
Coming to saloon, Lenny?

561
01:28:12,408 --> 01:28:15,744
Why didn't you make yourself
the mayor of the town?

562
01:28:25,838 --> 01:28:28,757
Keoma!
Keoma?

563
01:28:29,466 --> 01:28:30,968
Keoma!

564
01:30:50,482 --> 01:30:54,653
Yes sir!
We all turn this hill town,

565
01:30:55,487 --> 01:30:57,906
Into a regular metropolis.

566
01:31:01,034 --> 01:31:04,580
-I think I've created a monster.
-Yeah.

567
01:31:04,788 --> 01:31:07,708
Hey, Sam! Looks like
I've got my hands fulled.

568
01:31:08,083 --> 01:31:11,003
That woman take out
cuts you to down a size.

569
01:31:29,730 --> 01:31:32,232
Butch, Lenny!

570
01:31:37,321 --> 01:31:41,325
Goddamit!
Come on, let's go find him!

571
01:38:29,732 --> 01:38:32,860
I can't Keoma!
He'll die!

572
01:38:37,532 --> 01:38:39,867
He can't die,
and you know why?

573
01:38:39,951 --> 01:38:46,332
Because he's free,
and the man who is free never dies.

574
01:38:54,590 --> 01:38:59,262
