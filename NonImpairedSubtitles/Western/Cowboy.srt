1
00:01:52,553 --> 00:01:54,646
Señor Reece is coming.

2
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:58,452
- Beg your pardon?
- He's here, in Chicago.

3
00:01:59,127 --> 00:02:01,459
Mr. Reece, did you say?

4
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:05,722
- He'll be here soon.
- He wants his usual accommodations?

5
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:09,892
- Just like always.
- Tell him everything will be ready.

6
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:11,799
Right.

7
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,906
Tucker, Hamblin.

8
00:02:17,645 --> 00:02:20,136
Mr. Reece is in town.

9
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:23,442
He'll want the south wing
of the 2nd floor.

10
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:28,350
- We already have people in that wing.
- They'll have to be moved.

11
00:02:28,589 --> 00:02:32,958
Tucker, the kitchen and liquor pantry
will need extra waiters.

12
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,163
We'll put Mr. Reece in 200A as usual.

13
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:40,198
Mr. Fowler,
the Vidals are in that suite.

14
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:45,134
You're well acquainted with
Miss Vidal. Move them elsewhere.

15
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:48,968
You just don't move
people like the Vidals.

16
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:52,271
Bring Mr. Reece's trunks up.

17
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,644
Everything is to be pressed,
evening clothes first.

18
00:03:15,837 --> 00:03:18,897
You know I cannot see you here.

19
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,007
My aunt is inside,
and my father is due.

20
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:26,078
I know, I have to speak
to your father.

21
00:03:26,347 --> 00:03:28,508
- My father?
- Yes.

22
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,709
It's a hotel situation.
Something about the rooms.

23
00:03:32,987 --> 00:03:36,013
May I wait inside? Please?

24
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,018
Yes, of course.

25
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:00,547
Last night, I thought it was
the moonlight. I was wrong.

26
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,945
- About what?
- You're just as pretty in here.

27
00:04:04,185 --> 00:04:08,178
- Frank, please!
- You said she doesn't speak English.

28
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:13,416
She can see the expression in your
eyes. Anybody can understand that.

29
00:04:13,694 --> 00:04:16,686
Did you understand the poem I sent?

30
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:19,593
Poem? What poem?

31
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:29,438
- Father, this is...
- Yes, I know Mr. Harris.

32
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,044
There's been a mistake.
It seems these rooms were reserved.

33
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:38,615
However, I have another suite of rooms
that is much larger.

34
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,278
- There's a breeze...
- We're comfortable here.

35
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:48,586
Yes, sir. But I'm only acting
on orders from the manager.

36
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,426
- Isn't there anything I can do...?
- Yes, there is.

37
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,566
You can tell me if you wrote...

38
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,171
...this poetry to my daughter.

39
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:05,274
I'm in love with your daughter.
I'd like to marry her.

40
00:05:20,094 --> 00:05:24,997
I could never approve.
Our way of life is too different.

41
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:27,860
I don't intend to remain
a hotel clerk.

42
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:33,038
I came to get in the cattle business,
to make a fortune on the trail.

43
00:05:33,274 --> 00:05:36,835
In Maria's world,
money is no recommendation.

44
00:05:37,144 --> 00:05:41,376
Maria, we are going home.
Let's start packing.

45
00:05:41,816 --> 00:05:46,378
And now, be good enough
to have my bill sent up.

46
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,817
Goodbye, young man.

47
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:57,395
And don't think
that love can find a way.

48
00:05:57,698 --> 00:05:59,962
I know all the ways.

49
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,801
Here he comes!

50
00:06:20,988 --> 00:06:24,424
- Pleased to have you again.
- Pleasure to be here.

51
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:28,992
- I want my men taken care of.
- We'll take you to your rooms.

52
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,926
- Bring a large herd?
- Worst trail ever.

53
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:35,896
Storms, droughts and Indians
fed on my beef.

54
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:39,664
Send up whiskey and cold chickens.
I'm sick of beef.

55
00:06:39,907 --> 00:06:40,999
Right away.

56
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:45,372
- You have enough food for the party?
- All taken care of.

57
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:50,448
And hot baths. We've been
on the trail for two months!

58
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,547
First one to the bath, boys!

59
00:06:54,755 --> 00:06:59,852
- Señor Vidal, what are you doing here?
- A visit. I'm returning to Mexico.

60
00:07:00,094 --> 00:07:03,586
We'll be there in spring.
Any cattle worth buying?

61
00:07:03,864 --> 00:07:06,765
I can sell you all you want.

62
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:11,029
Hold on to them.
We'll do business when I get there.

63
00:07:12,106 --> 00:07:13,869
Thank you.

64
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:19,145
Maria.

65
00:07:23,284 --> 00:07:24,774
Maria!

66
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,629
We lost 87 head on the stock train
between here and Wichita.

67
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:45,272
They got shaken off their feet,
kicked to death.

68
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:48,135
You should have seen that roadbed.

69
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:51,505
It had rail gaps in it
8 inches wide.

70
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:54,408
Might've been safer to trail through.

71
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:57,344
Lose a few pounds, save a few cow.

72
00:07:57,618 --> 00:08:01,486
- How's the opera season this year?
- Beg your pardon?

73
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,623
Opera, man. Opera!

74
00:08:03,924 --> 00:08:07,587
- I don't know, I guess it's all right.
- You guess?

75
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:12,561
You call yourself civilized,
but know nothing about the opera?

76
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:16,669
- I keep my mind on business.
- Let's get to business.

77
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:21,968
- I have 2476 head. Quotations?
- Two and a half cents per pound.

78
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:25,303
- Could go down by morning.
- Could go up.

79
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,673
I got 80 percent grassers...

80
00:08:27,982 --> 00:08:30,883
...10 percent half-fats,
10 percent canners.

81
00:08:31,118 --> 00:08:35,521
- Little low on canners.
- Little high. You get the best of it.

82
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:39,022
I figure two and three-quarters
for the lot.

83
00:08:39,326 --> 00:08:41,123
We figured two and a half.

84
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:45,025
Two and three-quarters,
or I feed them till they go to three.

85
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:47,166
Decide. I want a bath.

86
00:08:47,368 --> 00:08:50,360
New York market's closed.
We should wait.

87
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:54,667
- He's right. We should think it over.
- You do that, Mac.

88
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,311
Paco, go keep an eye on those cows.

89
00:08:58,546 --> 00:09:01,743
We're holding on to them for a while.

90
00:09:05,152 --> 00:09:10,215
Chicago has all the coal in the world!
You can't get enough hot water!

91
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,093
Where's that boy?

92
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:17,820
Boy, when I take a bath,
I want hot water!

93
00:09:18,032 --> 00:09:20,967
When I mean hot water,
I mean hot water!

94
00:09:21,302 --> 00:09:24,635
Hot water...
Can't take a bath...

95
00:09:33,981 --> 00:09:35,676
Tom...

96
00:09:35,983 --> 00:09:38,816
...you ready to talk business now?

97
00:09:39,286 --> 00:09:41,720
Boot's grown to my foot.

98
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:44,851
I think I'm beefsteaked.

99
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:51,196
- You were kind of quiet out there.
- Let the boys do the bickering.

100
00:09:51,398 --> 00:09:54,196
Makes it easier to close the deal.

101
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:58,701
Two and a half cents for everything
if you deal right now.

102
00:09:58,906 --> 00:10:01,374
You know how I feel about cows.

103
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:05,738
I'd just as soon own them and be poor
as sell them and be rich.

104
00:10:06,046 --> 00:10:10,983
You can't wait for them to fatten,
you have to start on a new drive.

105
00:10:11,252 --> 00:10:15,052
You need beef so bad
your mouth's watering.

106
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:18,655
You can have the whole lot for 48,000.

107
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:20,554
You got a deal.

108
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,722
Now we can quit lying
and get to business.

109
00:10:24,932 --> 00:10:28,663
Pull up a chair and open the whiskey.
Have a drink.

110
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:32,202
- Boy, we need more whiskey!
- Yes, sir!

111
00:10:32,406 --> 00:10:35,102
Tom, when will you get smart...

112
00:10:35,376 --> 00:10:38,675
...stop beating yourself
out on that trail?

113
00:10:38,913 --> 00:10:40,608
Hook up with me here.

114
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:44,715
We'll build the biggest
meatpacking business in town.

115
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,714
I could never learn to play partners.

116
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,685
I just think about it,
I get itchy all over.

117
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:58,197
Get some nice clothes on,
we're going to the opera.

118
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,627
- Opera?
- Yeah.

119
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:02,732
- What about the party?
- That's after.

120
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,528
Pour it in, son.

121
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,574
Sounds like the party's
already started.

122
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:24,753
Close that door out there!
I'm freezing my whiffletree!

123
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:36,870
Come in.

124
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,303
Come in.

125
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:45,672
I took the liberty
of bringing these to you myself.

126
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,677
- Set them down and open one for me.
- Yes, sir.

127
00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:53,613
I understand you're going
back down to Mexico?

128
00:11:53,821 --> 00:11:57,086
If the good Lord spares me.

129
00:11:58,192 --> 00:12:00,660
And if I ever get another drink.

130
00:12:04,465 --> 00:12:07,093
Mr. Reece...

131
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:10,828
- To the brim, that's what a cup's for.
- Yes, sir.

132
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:14,000
Mr. Reece...

133
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:17,342
...l'm a farmer.

134
00:12:18,345 --> 00:12:20,142
You had me fooled.

135
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:24,841
No, what I mean is,
I was raised on a farm.

136
00:12:25,052 --> 00:12:30,149
I know a lot about animals, and I'm
interested in the cattle business.

137
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:32,791
That's why I came here.

138
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:35,860
I'd like to go to work for you, sir.

139
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,788
Cockroach.

140
00:12:40,334 --> 00:12:44,202
What makes you think
you'd like to go trail-herding?

141
00:12:45,873 --> 00:12:50,037
All my life I've dreamt
of going into the cattle business.

142
00:12:50,244 --> 00:12:51,905
Getting on the trail.

143
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:55,479
I hate Chicago,
I'd like to live in the open.

144
00:12:55,683 --> 00:12:58,675
- You know what I mean.
- I know.

145
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:04,084
Lying under the stars,
the boys singing around the campfire.

146
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:09,856
And your faithful old horse
grazing at the grass by your side.

147
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:14,530
- You do much riding?
- Me?

148
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,804
I bet I could ride all day and night.

149
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,269
Is that a fact?

150
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:24,102
- I bet you like horses.
- I sure do.

151
00:13:24,511 --> 00:13:26,945
I thought so.

152
00:13:27,948 --> 00:13:32,612
You're an idiot. A dreamy idiot,
and that's the worst kind.

153
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:38,051
Know what it's really like?
Dust storms and cloudbursts.

154
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:42,194
Only a fool wants that.
And that hogwash about horses.

155
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:46,025
The loyalty and intelligence
of the horse.

156
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:49,463
A horse's brain
is the size of a walnut.

157
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,536
They're mean, treacherous and stupid.

158
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,301
Not enough sense to move away
from a hot fire.

159
00:13:56,577 --> 00:13:58,602
No sensible man loves a horse.

160
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:03,943
He tolerates the filthy animal
because riding's better than walking.

161
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,812
Pour me a little more whiskey.

162
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:12,151
In spite of having a brain
the size of a bean, no horse ever...

163
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,335
- And did you ever taste horse?
- No.

164
00:14:22,603 --> 00:14:27,336
Hasn't got a gamy or beef flavour.
Just tastes like horse.

165
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:32,442
As for cattle, those miserable,
slab-sided fleabags...

166
00:14:33,313 --> 00:14:35,406
- Pour yourself a drink.
- No.

167
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:38,743
No matter what you say,
I want that job.

168
00:14:38,986 --> 00:14:42,285
- Try another outfit.
- I have.

169
00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:45,356
A tenderfoot's
too much responsibility.

170
00:14:45,626 --> 00:14:51,189
- It wouldn't be your responsibility.
- Everything is on the trail!

171
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,333
Can you put the studs
in that dress shirt?

172
00:14:56,603 --> 00:14:59,333
I don't wanna be late for the opera.

173
00:15:11,552 --> 00:15:14,988
I thought I saw a spider up there.

174
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:29,227
Isn't that beautiful? It is.

175
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:39,540
Mike, isn't that the most
beautiful thing you ever heard?

176
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:44,807
One thing about opera: It sounds
just as bad no matter who sings it.

177
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,512
Hey, boss!
This is the best party you ever threw!

178
00:15:49,756 --> 00:15:53,692
- It was good last year.
- She wasn't here last year.

179
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:57,522
And we weren't expecting
that extra money.

180
00:15:57,731 --> 00:16:01,497
Thank my friend here.
He overpaid for the herd!

181
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,600
Yes, you did!

182
00:16:05,572 --> 00:16:07,096
Well, well, well.

183
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,902
Leaving a little early,
aren't you, Peggy?

184
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:16,345
- Tom, the poker game's all set up.
- Let's go to work!

185
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:21,213
You ladies amuse yourselves
for a while. Don't go away, though.

186
00:16:21,455 --> 00:16:22,752
Come on, Mike!

187
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:27,790
I hate to keep bleeding you, Tom,
but I have to raise it 100.

188
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:30,052
It's up to you, Reece.

189
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:34,624
- I'll call you.
- Pass.

190
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,301
Pass.

191
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:39,435
Three kings.

192
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,936
Beats me.

193
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:53,214
- $50 on the filly.
- You got a bet.

194
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,389
Joe, you take your hands off me!

195
00:16:56,623 --> 00:16:59,114
Just not my night, I guess.

196
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,097
Why don't you wait over there for me?

197
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,167
It's your deal.

198
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:21,804
Here's the hand, right here.

199
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,853
Want to buy some chips, Tom?

200
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:30,351
No, not right now.

201
00:17:31,158 --> 00:17:34,321
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Sure.

202
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:44,601
I'd like to pay my bill.
I'm leaving in the morning.

203
00:17:44,805 --> 00:17:47,933
I better pay
while I still have some money.

204
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:50,837
Divide what's left amongst the help.

205
00:17:51,144 --> 00:17:54,272
We thought you'd stay for a week.

206
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:59,316
So did I, but I don't
usually lose quite so fast.

207
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,683
- See you next time.
- Without cash, how can you buy cattle?

208
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,790
My credit's still good.

209
00:18:06,226 --> 00:18:08,490
Mr. Reece...

210
00:18:10,197 --> 00:18:13,132
...could you use some money?

211
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:14,834
What if I could?

212
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,696
You might take me along
as a partner...

213
00:18:18,905 --> 00:18:22,238
...if I was willing
to invest some money.

214
00:18:23,076 --> 00:18:26,477
- How much you got?
- $3800.

215
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,910
- I beg your pardon?
- $3800.

216
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:32,743
My father gave it to me
when he sold the farm.

217
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,386
- Where is it?
- Here in the safe.

218
00:18:37,724 --> 00:18:41,057
- Well, get it out, boy.
- Yes, sir.

219
00:18:44,097 --> 00:18:47,328
There they are, gents. All spades.

220
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:52,338
Where did you get money this late?

221
00:18:52,606 --> 00:18:57,737
An honest man has friends everywhere,
but you wouldn't know that.

222
00:18:57,944 --> 00:18:59,172
I ante.

223
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:02,610
Mr. Harris would like to talk to you.

224
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:06,284
- Harris?
- He's the desk clerk.

225
00:19:06,586 --> 00:19:10,613
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Deal me out of this one.

226
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,290
You want to see me?

227
00:19:19,566 --> 00:19:24,697
I wrote out an agreement about
our partnership, a contract.

228
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:26,937
Contract? What for?

229
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:31,473
So we'd both know what the deal was.
See, it's...

230
00:19:32,646 --> 00:19:37,583
I've never signed a contract
or welshed on a deal in my life.

231
00:19:37,784 --> 00:19:41,083
You think I'd sell my reputation
for $3800?

232
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:45,314
I didn't think that. I just, it's...

233
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:48,725
I tell you what you do.

234
00:19:48,962 --> 00:19:53,399
Go home and get some sleep.
We're pulling out in the morning.

235
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,468
Fine. I hope you didn't think
I didn't trust you.

236
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,399
Forget it.

237
00:19:59,606 --> 00:20:01,335
Forget it.

238
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:05,472
Oh, by the way...

239
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,169
...my name's Tom.

240
00:20:08,014 --> 00:20:11,814
Thanks. Mine's Frank.

241
00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:44,475
Thanks.

242
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,828
Stampede! Come on, let's go!

243
00:20:58,031 --> 00:21:01,797
Pick up your gear.
The train leaves in 10 minutes.

244
00:21:04,504 --> 00:21:07,735
- All right, Mendoza. Wake up.
- What?

245
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:12,068
- We're heading south.
- So soon? What happened?

246
00:21:12,345 --> 00:21:15,246
You lose all the money so quick?

247
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:18,143
I won it back. Most of it, at least.

248
00:21:18,385 --> 00:21:23,084
- I'm getting out while I'm ahead.
- I hear you've got a partner.

249
00:21:23,356 --> 00:21:26,189
- Who told you that?
- Hi, Tom!

250
00:21:26,393 --> 00:21:27,883
He did.

251
00:21:29,262 --> 00:21:34,199
He woke me up this morning.
He's excited about going on the trail.

252
00:21:34,401 --> 00:21:38,701
He's got a girl.
She lives down in Guadalupe.

253
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:43,733
- How are you feeling today, Tom?
- I've got a headache.

254
00:21:43,944 --> 00:21:46,708
- Look, boy...
- My name's Frank.

255
00:21:47,914 --> 00:21:52,078
I borrowed some money last night,
and I'm paying you back.

256
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,580
With interest.

257
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:57,950
I don't want the money back.
We're partners.

258
00:21:58,225 --> 00:22:01,251
I was drinking. I made a mistake.

259
00:22:01,461 --> 00:22:04,589
I never had a partner, and never will.

260
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,234
Suppose you take this
and go back to the hotel.

261
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:13,735
- I quit my job at the hotel.
- Why'd you do a fool thing like that?

262
00:22:15,742 --> 00:22:18,939
Because you've got a girl in Mexico?

263
00:22:19,145 --> 00:22:21,079
You made a deal with me.

264
00:22:21,314 --> 00:22:25,614
I paid for a share of your outfit,
and that's all I want.

265
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,287
Don't talk like that.
I've ridden for 20 years.

266
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:34,255
Sweat over every trail. You think
you bought a percentage of that?

267
00:22:34,494 --> 00:22:39,625
- I bought what you were selling.
- I got four arrow holes, you buy that?

268
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:44,293
I believed you when you said you
never welshed on a deal.

269
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,836
- I'm giving your money back.
- That's not our deal.

270
00:22:48,141 --> 00:22:50,268
- He's right.
- How do you know?

271
00:22:50,477 --> 00:22:55,505
If he wasn't right,
you would have killed him by now.

272
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:04,857
You called me Tom.
I'd prefer you called me Reece.

273
00:23:05,091 --> 00:23:10,085
Anytime you want your money back,
you ask for it. Anytime.

274
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:34,350
- How about this guy, Reece?
- He's all right if you are.

275
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,385
Does he pay off at the end of a run?

276
00:23:37,657 --> 00:23:42,458
You ask him for what's coming
in the middle of a river crossing...

277
00:23:42,696 --> 00:23:44,857
...he'll pay off in dry bills.

278
00:23:58,044 --> 00:23:59,306
There!

279
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:03,447
- Dirty old dog!
- Curtis, you should've been with us!

280
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,346
You look scarier than last I saw you.

281
00:24:06,553 --> 00:24:09,386
We been in Chicago.
We got barrel fever.

282
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:13,558
Reece only gave us one night,
but what a night!

283
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,990
- Get my telegram?
- The men and grub are ready.

284
00:24:17,197 --> 00:24:19,597
The horses are outside of town.

285
00:24:19,866 --> 00:24:21,891
- Hire the extra hand?
- Sure.

286
00:24:22,202 --> 00:24:26,195
Here's Doc Bender.
Used to be marshal at Wichita.

287
00:24:26,906 --> 00:24:28,669
Hi.

288
00:24:43,556 --> 00:24:48,687
You got quite a reputation.
I wanted a cowhand, not a gunslinger.

289
00:24:48,895 --> 00:24:50,886
I'm a cowhand now.

290
00:24:51,131 --> 00:24:54,567
I like cows better than I like people.

291
00:24:54,768 --> 00:24:58,260
All right. Let's get going.

292
00:25:01,474 --> 00:25:06,275
Paco, get him something to wear.
He can't go on the trail like this.

293
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:09,879
Thought I'd buy clothes
if you'll wait.

294
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:14,883
Nobody's waiting. You stay with us,
you have to keep moving.

295
00:25:15,121 --> 00:25:19,820
See if there's a spare rig
for him in the chuck wagon.

296
00:25:20,126 --> 00:25:22,253
Come on, Harris.

297
00:25:23,763 --> 00:25:26,891
Beats me how women
can go for you cowboys.

298
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:32,264
Women like the smell of a horse
on a man. It makes them giggle.

299
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:35,997
The smell of a horse on me
never did me no good.

300
00:25:36,276 --> 00:25:38,506
Just makes them move away.

301
00:25:38,778 --> 00:25:43,909
Maybe you're associating with
the wrong horses. Good-looking boots.

302
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,983
Move them out.

303
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:30,023
- How's the water supply been?
- Not bad, boss.

304
00:26:46,312 --> 00:26:47,836
Pick your horses!

305
00:26:48,081 --> 00:26:52,484
Pick the horses that haven't
been ridden since we left!

306
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:56,553
Start breaking the ones
that haven't been broke.

307
00:27:05,598 --> 00:27:10,695
- Do these go on any special way?
- Yeah, like an apron.

308
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,987
Shake your tail, or there won't
be anything left fit to ride.

309
00:29:11,691 --> 00:29:13,386
Bring that horse back!

310
00:29:20,733 --> 00:29:24,999
If you can't ride that horse,
you'll have to carry him.

311
00:29:26,506 --> 00:29:30,203
Set another place, here comes Harris!

312
00:29:31,577 --> 00:29:35,877
Next time catch him.
Here he comes again!

313
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:49,814
- What is that?
- Salt water and whiskey.

314
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:53,923
Best way to toughen it up.
Feel any better?

315
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,890
Yeah, it burns instead of just aching.

316
00:30:57,163 --> 00:31:00,621
That's what it's supposed to do.
It fries your hide.

317
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,232
You look like you're half-dead.

318
00:31:03,469 --> 00:31:07,098
I can't get enough sleep.
Don't you get a day off?

319
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:12,300
No Sunday on the trail. You have
to learn to sleep in your saddle.

320
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:18,914
Yep. That's it.

321
00:31:25,992 --> 00:31:27,755
Harris?

322
00:31:28,694 --> 00:31:33,358
- I told you to ride night herd.
- I made a deal. Capper's doing it.

323
00:31:33,633 --> 00:31:37,535
Do your own job
and forget about making deals.

324
00:31:38,204 --> 00:31:43,198
If you can't pull your weight, say so.
You can have your money back.

325
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,371
I told you I didn't want it back.

326
00:31:47,613 --> 00:31:50,514
Then get out there and go to work.

327
00:33:37,957 --> 00:33:41,620
This little filly
up in Chicago says to me:

328
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:48,424
"Honey, stay here with me. I'll take
care of you the rest of your life."

329
00:33:48,634 --> 00:33:53,128
- Why didn't you do it?
- Who wants to live in Chicago?

330
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:56,499
Turn him loose around a woman
for 24 hours...

331
00:33:56,776 --> 00:33:59,973
...he's got enough flies
to last the season.

332
00:34:02,848 --> 00:34:06,978
Joe, tell the boys about the time
you ate them Indians.

333
00:34:07,186 --> 00:34:10,519
I ain't ate but one
Indian my whole life.

334
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,520
Even then it was just a haunch.

335
00:34:15,361 --> 00:34:18,524
Being a town marshal...

336
00:34:19,131 --> 00:34:22,464
...I figured that was
a pretty good job.

337
00:34:23,302 --> 00:34:25,827
What made you give it up?

338
00:34:26,872 --> 00:34:28,840
Same old story.

339
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,871
You know.

340
00:34:32,144 --> 00:34:35,045
Man gets a reputation with a gun...

341
00:34:35,348 --> 00:34:38,647
...he's just got to do
too much killing.

342
00:34:38,884 --> 00:34:41,284
Last time in Wichita...

343
00:34:41,554 --> 00:34:45,957
...two of them jumped me in the dark
and I had to shoot them.

344
00:34:46,158 --> 00:34:50,219
Later, I found they were just
young, drunken saddle bums...

345
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,555
...looking for excitement.

346
00:34:52,865 --> 00:34:56,130
That's when I quit my job as marshal.

347
00:34:56,535 --> 00:34:59,003
That's no way to live.

348
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,075
I can't understand,
something smells good.

349
00:35:04,343 --> 00:35:09,474
To hear you trail hands talk,
you'd think you were being poisoned.

350
00:35:09,715 --> 00:35:11,478
You've got a visitor!

351
00:35:13,252 --> 00:35:17,211
Snakes. I found one
curled up in my boot yesterday.

352
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,048
No, wait!

353
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:24,922
I ask you. Did you ever see a more
comfortable picture in your life?

354
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:32,364
Come to think of it,
I don't believe I ever did.

355
00:35:41,047 --> 00:35:43,777
Harris, want to see a prairie eel?

356
00:35:45,951 --> 00:35:47,680
Shoot him, Slim.

357
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,950
- Shoot him, Slim!
- Ain't my snake!

358
00:35:51,223 --> 00:35:52,520
Cut it out.

359
00:35:52,758 --> 00:35:57,286
- Here, Charlie, it's a girl.
- I like them with bigger hips.

360
00:35:59,065 --> 00:36:01,363
I said to cut it out.

361
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,396
It got me.

362
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,868
It got me.

363
00:36:18,117 --> 00:36:19,106
Go get him.

364
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:26,417
I got his legs. I got him here!

365
00:36:26,659 --> 00:36:29,924
- Let go of me!
- Wait a minute!

366
00:36:30,162 --> 00:36:33,563
You trying to pump that poison
to your heart?

367
00:36:33,799 --> 00:36:35,562
Leave me alone.

368
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:43,573
Must have got him in the vein.
He's bleeding enough.

369
00:36:43,776 --> 00:36:46,142
Oh, my God.

370
00:36:46,512 --> 00:36:48,912
Oh, my God.

371
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:10,830
Someday there'll be fences
up and down this trail.

372
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:15,437
I'd rather fight Indians than
cut my way through fences.

373
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:18,541
Joe would rather be fighting Indians.

374
00:37:18,844 --> 00:37:23,213
- Makes him hungry thinking about it.
- Cut it out.

375
00:37:23,482 --> 00:37:26,178
I was near starving to death.

376
00:37:26,385 --> 00:37:29,149
Besides,
I didn't even know that Indian.

377
00:37:29,388 --> 00:37:32,789
Anyway, I threw away
everything but one haunch.

378
00:37:33,025 --> 00:37:36,859
- Which one did you keep?
- The left one, of course.

379
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:41,463
The right one is the working haunch.
They're always tough.

380
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,696
How long do you figure to Guadalupe?

381
00:37:48,073 --> 00:37:51,372
Eight or nine days,
something like that.

382
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:56,547
I've been dreaming every night
about them Mexican gals.

383
00:37:56,749 --> 00:38:00,310
I wouldn't take $400
for what I dreamed last night.

384
00:38:00,553 --> 00:38:03,215
You've been talking in your sleep too.

385
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,481
I wish you'd dream something else.

386
00:38:06,692 --> 00:38:10,719
You think of something better
to dream about...

387
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,998
...l'll dream about it.

388
00:38:35,754 --> 00:38:38,587
Looks to me like he's dead, boss.

389
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:08,619
Slim, you, Capper, Harris.
Get some shovels.

390
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:12,987
Make it deep,
so the coyotes can't get at him.

391
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,104
Keep away from there.

392
00:39:32,511 --> 00:39:37,676
You killed him, aren't you satisfied?
You have to steal his boots?

393
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:42,479
- I killed him?
- Put it down or I'll bust you open!

394
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:55,758
You're not busting anybody.

395
00:39:55,968 --> 00:40:00,200
Someone did something stupid.
No reason to make more trouble.

396
00:40:00,406 --> 00:40:03,842
You don't like what goes on here,
that's too bad.

397
00:40:04,043 --> 00:40:07,206
Nobody said you were gonna like it.

398
00:40:07,713 --> 00:40:11,171
Now get out there and start digging.

399
00:40:39,044 --> 00:40:42,036
Anybody know the right words?

400
00:40:52,057 --> 00:40:53,991
All right.

401
00:40:55,094 --> 00:40:57,858
When something like this happens...

402
00:40:58,063 --> 00:41:00,930
...people ask how come it happened.

403
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:04,533
I mean...
Was it his fault?

404
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,732
Was it somebody else's fault?

405
00:41:08,273 --> 00:41:13,210
It isn't for us to say.
We don't know all the answers.

406
00:41:13,445 --> 00:41:17,074
All we know is a man's dead,
and that's that.

407
00:41:18,617 --> 00:41:21,347
It wouldn't have made a difference.

408
00:41:21,587 --> 00:41:26,456
If it hadn't been a snake,
it would've been a steer.

409
00:41:26,725 --> 00:41:28,454
Or a Comanche.

410
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,788
His horse might even have stumbled...

411
00:41:32,064 --> 00:41:35,625
...in a prairie dog hole
some dark night.

412
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,776
He was a good man with cattle.

413
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,540
Always did the best he knew how.

414
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:56,885
I hope somebody
can say the same over me.

415
00:41:57,923 --> 00:42:00,483
All right, fill her up.

416
00:43:37,322 --> 00:43:42,089
After seven weeks, it will be good
to have chicken again.

417
00:43:42,728 --> 00:43:47,222
- What are the decorations for?
- Some kind of fiesta.

418
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,938
Ask him where the Vidal ranch is.

419
00:43:59,745 --> 00:44:04,341
He says when we leave this town,
there ain't nothing else but.

420
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,428
We're going to Vidal's
to pick up a herd.

421
00:44:21,633 --> 00:44:23,362
I'm going too.

422
00:44:23,969 --> 00:44:26,437
- What for?
- I'm your partner.

423
00:44:26,638 --> 00:44:31,769
You mean you've got personal business?
I forgot about Miss Vidal.

424
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:35,445
You men drink now,
we'll be branding tomorrow.

425
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:40,413
Any man that starts a fight
will have to finish it with me.

426
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:28,932
- Welcome.
- We're glad to be here.

427
00:45:29,134 --> 00:45:31,694
This is Paco Mendoza.

428
00:45:32,638 --> 00:45:33,866
Frank Harris.

429
00:45:34,172 --> 00:45:37,198
Yes, I know Señor Harris.

430
00:45:37,476 --> 00:45:39,842
He writes poetry.

431
00:45:40,545 --> 00:45:43,105
- He does?
- I used to.

432
00:45:43,382 --> 00:45:45,282
Come in, please.

433
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:02,289
- May I present Señor Reece...
- How do you do?

434
00:46:02,501 --> 00:46:04,162
...Señor Harris...

435
00:46:04,403 --> 00:46:06,132
...Señor Mendoza.

436
00:46:06,338 --> 00:46:10,741
My sister Doña Luisa,
my daughter Maria...

437
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:13,877
...and her husband, Manuel Arriega.

438
00:46:18,884 --> 00:46:22,081
Would you gentlemen care for a drink?

439
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,879
If you don't mind...

440
00:46:24,189 --> 00:46:28,148
...I thought we might
look over the beef.

441
00:46:28,393 --> 00:46:29,690
As you wish.

442
00:46:29,928 --> 00:46:32,829
Manuel, please bring our horses.

443
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,562
This way, sir.

444
00:46:54,619 --> 00:46:56,951
How long will this take?

445
00:46:57,189 --> 00:47:00,784
We'll stay till the job is finished.

446
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,535
I hope you're satisfied.

447
00:47:14,773 --> 00:47:16,866
- Looks good.
- Best there is.

448
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:19,634
By the way, we're having a fiesta.

449
00:47:19,911 --> 00:47:23,779
There will be much amusement.
I hope you all will come.

450
00:47:23,982 --> 00:47:28,942
After the branding. The boys
could stand a little amusement.

451
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:50,098
- You did not get my letter?
- I left Chicago the day after you.

452
00:47:50,342 --> 00:47:54,142
I wrote to explain the whole thing.

453
00:47:54,346 --> 00:47:56,940
I never expected to see you again.

454
00:47:57,149 --> 00:48:02,143
- Why didn't you wait?
- Please, you must leave now.

455
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:06,983
- I'm not permitted to see you alone.
- Why didn't you wait?

456
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,625
I should explain, Manuel...

457
00:48:09,828 --> 00:48:13,662
...that Señor Harris is a friend
from Chicago.

458
00:48:14,633 --> 00:48:20,003
And I should explain to you, Maria,
that you are my wife.

459
00:48:20,605 --> 00:48:24,473
You will of course not wish
to see her again, alone.

460
00:48:26,178 --> 00:48:30,877
I believe Señor Reece
is waiting for you.

461
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,386
That's all I could
grab hold of, honey.

462
00:49:18,597 --> 00:49:20,997
You can't win all of them.

463
00:49:58,069 --> 00:50:00,731
The final event,
ladies and gentlemen...

464
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,973
...is the game of the cattle.

465
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:35,635
- Mendoza, what's this about?
- It's a crazy game. Stay out of it.

466
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,934
That bull in there is a real killer.

467
00:50:39,177 --> 00:50:41,771
See? The horns are painted red.

468
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:47,509
Man has to put a ring over his horn.
Some do it, some get killed.

469
00:50:47,752 --> 00:50:49,413
That's not for me.

470
00:50:52,991 --> 00:50:58,691
Manuel Arriega challenges anyone
who wishes to compete against him.

471
00:51:00,999 --> 00:51:05,698
Perhaps one of the Americanos
would like to take a chance?

472
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:27,389
I wouldn't go in there for a whiskey
and a woman to pour it.

473
00:53:13,965 --> 00:53:16,559
Now for the American caballero!

474
00:53:16,801 --> 00:53:19,895
I'll bet 10 on the American.

475
00:53:20,138 --> 00:53:23,574
- Who wants to make a real bet?
- $100!

476
00:53:23,808 --> 00:53:25,241
You got it!

477
00:53:25,477 --> 00:53:29,914
Anybody wants an advance,
go ahead and make your bets.

478
00:53:30,148 --> 00:53:34,915
Harris, come here.
I'm playing this one myself.

479
00:53:35,153 --> 00:53:39,681
- Why didn't you say so before?
- I didn't have money up before.

480
00:53:39,958 --> 00:53:44,361
- Trying to show off?
- Protecting my bet, that's all.

481
00:53:44,662 --> 00:53:47,460
Getting killed for money
is one thing...

482
00:53:47,665 --> 00:53:50,327
...doing it to impress a girl
is stupid.

483
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:54,799
Paco. Take him away,
I don't want him.

484
00:53:55,006 --> 00:53:59,500
- You crazy?
- I don't want to get him cut up.

485
00:54:08,353 --> 00:54:11,845
The next contestant is
Don Thomas Reece.

486
00:54:12,323 --> 00:54:13,654
Open it up, son.

487
00:57:33,224 --> 00:57:36,921
I could not let you go without
seeing you once more.

488
00:57:37,195 --> 00:57:41,029
Without talking with you, alone.

489
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:45,993
You know my father was
troubled about us in Chicago.

490
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:51,867
As soon as we returned here,
Manuel and I were betrothed.

491
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:56,211
Here, children have nothing to say
about these things.

492
00:57:56,414 --> 00:57:57,938
Do you love him?

493
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:03,082
I am not a child anymore.
I cannot have everything...

494
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:06,414
Tell me. Do you love him?

495
00:58:38,823 --> 00:58:41,257
- What's the matter?
- I need a drink.

496
00:58:41,492 --> 00:58:45,895
Better stay out of there.
Charlie's inside asking for trouble.

497
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:48,291
He'll get himself carved up.

498
00:58:48,499 --> 00:58:53,129
- Doesn't he need help?
- You want to help him? You help him.

499
00:58:53,337 --> 00:58:58,400
Get knifed in the belly, you won't
be able to hold your guts in.

500
00:58:58,643 --> 00:59:03,342
- I'm not gonna run out on him.
- You're a good boy.

501
01:01:14,245 --> 01:01:17,373
Joe, wake up! Charlie's in trouble!

502
01:01:17,648 --> 01:01:22,745
- He's gonna get his throat cut!
- That's his problem.

503
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:29,253
- You gotta help.
- I told you to stay out of it.

504
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:33,624
- He's grabbing someone's gal.
- No reason for us to get hurt.

505
01:01:33,831 --> 01:01:37,267
If a man picks a fight,
he's gotta fight it.

506
01:01:37,468 --> 01:01:40,403
The fun's in the picking,
not the fighting.

507
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:45,069
Doc, you gotta help.
Charlie's in bad trouble.

508
01:01:45,276 --> 01:01:48,507
Four guys in the saloon
are gonna jump him.

509
01:01:48,779 --> 01:01:52,909
- Four of them?
- Yeah. What do you say, Doc?

510
01:01:53,184 --> 01:01:55,243
I don't like the odds.

511
01:01:55,486 --> 01:01:59,183
- What do we do? Let him get killed?
- All right.

512
01:02:01,158 --> 01:02:05,185
We heard about Charlie.
Now shut up and go to bed.

513
01:02:05,463 --> 01:02:09,160
- What'll you do about him?
- Go to bed, same as you.

514
01:02:09,433 --> 01:02:11,697
What happens to him?

515
01:02:11,969 --> 01:02:16,804
Man's old enough to get in trouble,
he can get himself out of it.

516
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,008
I got cows to worry about.

517
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:21,678
A man's life means nothing to you?

518
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:26,042
All you care about
is your herd of cattle!

519
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:33,684
You're the most miserable bunch
of men I ever saw in my whole life.

520
01:02:34,025 --> 01:02:37,517
Not one shred of decency
in the lot of you.

521
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:41,492
I thought I'd be living with some men
on the trail.

522
01:02:41,699 --> 01:02:44,293
Not just a pack of animals.

523
01:02:44,535 --> 01:02:48,699
I'm sorry we don't measure up
to your way of thinking.

524
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:50,964
But get one thing straight:

525
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:54,541
Nobody cares what you thought
it would be.

526
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:58,475
You wanted to play cowboy.
Didn't realize it's rough.

527
01:02:58,716 --> 01:03:03,847
I'm gonna help Charlie.
Is anyone going with me or am I alone?

528
01:03:04,055 --> 01:03:05,181
Nobody's leaving.

529
01:03:05,389 --> 01:03:10,554
You start trouble, we'll lose men.
The whole town will be on our hands.

530
01:03:10,761 --> 01:03:15,255
Why don't you forget
about what's really bothering you?

531
01:03:15,499 --> 01:03:19,902
Starting a fight won't help you
get that girl back.

532
01:03:21,539 --> 01:03:23,598
That doesn't work, either.

533
01:03:23,908 --> 01:03:28,607
I'm going back and there's nothing
you can do about it.

534
01:04:17,762 --> 01:04:21,061
- The fire!
- I see it.

535
01:04:24,502 --> 01:04:26,800
- You had enough?
- No!

536
01:04:32,943 --> 01:04:34,467
Enough!

537
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:54,290
- You don't even fight like a man.
- Fighting's no game with me.

538
01:04:54,532 --> 01:04:56,659
I'll remember that.

539
01:04:56,867 --> 01:04:59,927
Next time I'll use a crowbar.

540
01:05:00,137 --> 01:05:01,866
You just do that.

541
01:05:04,141 --> 01:05:05,608
Peggy...

542
01:05:07,378 --> 01:05:09,972
...I want some hot coffee.

543
01:05:19,223 --> 01:05:22,283
All right. Move them out!

544
01:05:28,732 --> 01:05:30,529
How's the arm, Charlie?

545
01:05:30,734 --> 01:05:33,669
It's my drinking arm,
not my loving arm.

546
01:05:33,904 --> 01:05:38,864
He got cut up a little, is all.
Not enough to teach him a lesson.

547
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:47,215
Harris will make a good cowboy.

548
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:50,010
You think I've been rough on him.

549
01:05:50,221 --> 01:05:53,349
That's what my father
said to my mother.

550
01:05:53,557 --> 01:05:56,993
He always treated me too hard,
my father.

551
01:05:57,261 --> 01:06:00,025
But he liked me very much.

552
01:07:01,158 --> 01:07:02,887
Capper!

553
01:07:10,467 --> 01:07:12,992
Just leave it for the coyotes.

554
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:18,300
- He can't keep up with the herd.
- See if you can get a cow to feed him.

555
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:20,840
I don't want it on my saddle!

556
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:26,175
- It's worth $20 in Chicago. And you?
- Take him back to the herd.

557
01:07:30,621 --> 01:07:32,816
Get on, cow, cow!

558
01:07:36,827 --> 01:07:38,488
You're learning.

559
01:07:38,696 --> 01:07:40,823
That a cow means more than a man?

560
01:07:41,031 --> 01:07:45,127
I play your rules,
but that doesn't mean I like them.

561
01:07:49,006 --> 01:07:52,533
I've been meaning
to talk to you about something.

562
01:07:52,843 --> 01:07:54,310
What?

563
01:07:55,179 --> 01:07:57,647
That girl back there.

564
01:07:57,881 --> 01:08:01,180
Those things can be pretty rough.

565
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:05,183
But a deal like that
never works out in the long run.

566
01:08:05,489 --> 01:08:08,287
You got too much going against it.

567
01:08:08,525 --> 01:08:13,485
So you just mark it off,
and figure it's a part of growing up.

568
01:08:14,798 --> 01:08:18,165
Nobody asked me,
but I think you're better off.

569
01:08:18,369 --> 01:08:20,860
You do, huh?

570
01:08:21,138 --> 01:08:23,368
Maybe it's not my business...

571
01:08:23,574 --> 01:08:27,510
That's right.
It's none of your business.

572
01:08:55,539 --> 01:08:58,007
Curtis. Look, Indians.

573
01:08:58,242 --> 01:09:03,202
Been following us for three hours,
hoping to pick up some strays.

574
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:13,248
We'll bed the herd
here for the night...

575
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:15,856
...and make camp up there.

576
01:09:39,983 --> 01:09:41,917
Paco!

577
01:09:53,831 --> 01:09:58,268
- How many men are with the herd?
- Two, just like always.

578
01:09:58,469 --> 01:10:01,495
Better put a couple more on tonight.

579
01:10:02,139 --> 01:10:06,974
- Where's Harris?
- He went after strays. 40 of them.

580
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:09,576
There's Indians. Why send him?

581
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:13,841
I didn't. He went by himself.

582
01:10:16,153 --> 01:10:19,452
I want two more men
down there tonight.

583
01:10:48,819 --> 01:10:52,448
- Harris back yet?
- Not yet.

584
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:09,503
Hey, Reece.

585
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:11,799
Indians.

586
01:11:17,681 --> 01:11:20,149
Comanches.

587
01:11:51,415 --> 01:11:54,543
Hold your fire till they get in range.

588
01:11:57,187 --> 01:12:01,715
- Must make you feel hungry, Joe.
- Shut up, will you?

589
01:12:07,798 --> 01:12:13,031
They're not even heading this way.
They're after something else.

590
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:35,548
Harris must be down there.
They'll hit him and take the strays.

591
01:12:35,792 --> 01:12:38,317
How come they passed us by?

592
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:41,463
They got a better deal down there.

593
01:12:41,765 --> 01:12:44,962
Kill one man
and get 40 head of cattle.

594
01:12:45,168 --> 01:12:47,432
We wouldn't stand a chance.

595
01:12:47,638 --> 01:12:50,334
He picked a fine time to play cowboy.

596
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:55,637
While they're busy with him,
we can get away. He's a goner.

597
01:12:56,980 --> 01:12:58,777
Paco.

598
01:13:02,452 --> 01:13:06,980
We'll stampede the herd into that
arroyo and drive the Indians off.

599
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:10,591
We'll never get the cattle back
in this country.

600
01:13:10,827 --> 01:13:15,594
I, too, like this boy.
But we have to think about the herd.

601
01:13:15,832 --> 01:13:18,801
It's my herd, isn't it?

602
01:15:36,306 --> 01:15:39,400
It's all right.
It's all right.

603
01:15:40,811 --> 01:15:42,938
You won't be able to ride.

604
01:15:45,949 --> 01:15:49,077
You scattered our herd all over!

605
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:51,344
Why are you bellyaching?

606
01:15:51,621 --> 01:15:55,182
I could've fought them off one by one!

607
01:15:57,294 --> 01:15:59,956
I wish I'd let you try.

608
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:05,265
Reece's knee is shot up.
I'm taking over the herd.

609
01:16:05,469 --> 01:16:08,199
Mendoza's taking over.

610
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:10,303
I'm the partner, not him.

611
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:13,805
Doc and Capper,
take Reece to the wagon.

612
01:16:14,044 --> 01:16:18,606
We work straight through
till we get that herd rounded up.

613
01:16:27,991 --> 01:16:31,950
- I ought to tear him apart.
- You'll tear yourself apart.

614
01:16:32,195 --> 01:16:35,130
He's young. What can go wrong?

615
01:16:35,398 --> 01:16:37,525
I'll keep an eye on things.

616
01:16:37,734 --> 01:16:41,067
- We'll cut him some splints.
- Come on.

617
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:55,713
Let's keep moving, men.
We can't rest now.

618
01:17:13,336 --> 01:17:16,737
Come on, it's nearly dawn. Mount up.

619
01:17:22,879 --> 01:17:25,370
Get off my bedroll, Curtis.

620
01:17:27,284 --> 01:17:30,185
I've worked day and night.
I ain't moving.

621
01:17:30,387 --> 01:17:32,753
Move or I'll teach you manners.

622
01:17:32,956 --> 01:17:36,722
You do and you'll
learn more than you teach.

623
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:55,409
Cut it out!

624
01:18:16,666 --> 01:18:20,966
Now we'll see
what you had for breakfast!

625
01:18:26,309 --> 01:18:28,903
Get back up the hill.

626
01:18:55,038 --> 01:18:59,134
You better slack off.
The boys are getting pretty mean.

627
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:03,102
We rounded up all the herd
we could find.

628
01:19:03,346 --> 01:19:07,282
- How many head did we lose?
- Just over 200.

629
01:19:07,517 --> 01:19:09,951
- That's a lot.
- Yeah, it's too bad.

630
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:13,451
- It's too bad for you.
- Why?

631
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:18,525
We found all my cows.
Seems it was yours that ran off.

632
01:19:19,529 --> 01:19:24,660
That's interesting.
How did you separate yours from mine?

633
01:19:25,201 --> 01:19:27,169
It was easy.

634
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:29,995
I used a crowbar.

635
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:43,981
Okay! Move them out!

636
01:20:55,592 --> 01:20:59,050
- How far is it into town?
- Just over the hill.

637
01:21:04,267 --> 01:21:08,829
I'd like to draw my time when we
get in town. Stay a while.

638
01:21:09,105 --> 01:21:11,630
I thought you weren't going back.

639
01:21:11,908 --> 01:21:16,277
I figure if I wasn't marshal,
I could live here peaceful.

640
01:21:16,513 --> 01:21:19,277
There's a fellow in town, Sam Hacker.

641
01:21:19,482 --> 01:21:22,417
A no-good cuss.
But we were good friends.

642
01:21:22,652 --> 01:21:27,180
- I miss the old son of a gun.
- You're getting old.

643
01:21:27,490 --> 01:21:28,980
It ain't that.

644
01:21:29,192 --> 01:21:33,026
A man has to have something
besides a gun and saddle.

645
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:36,164
You just can't make it by yourself.

646
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:40,836
I wish you luck.
I hope it all turns out peaceful.

647
01:21:41,104 --> 01:21:43,265
Maybe I'll see you next time.

648
01:22:46,536 --> 01:22:48,936
- Railcar's loaded.
- Twelve cars!

649
01:22:49,205 --> 01:22:52,265
Keep them moving. We've gotta go!

650
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:10,025
Did you hear about Doc Bender?
He's dead.

651
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:13,752
- He killed himself.
- You're crazy.

652
01:23:14,097 --> 01:23:19,228
He was in the saloon drinking
with a friend of his, Sam Hacker.

653
01:23:19,469 --> 01:23:24,600
Hacker got real mean and pulled
a gun on Doc. Doc had to kill him.

654
01:23:24,874 --> 01:23:28,207
- What happened to Doc?
- He hung himself.

655
01:23:28,444 --> 01:23:31,971
In the livery stable.
Nobody knows why.

656
01:23:32,215 --> 01:23:35,742
- Thirteen cars loaded.
- Right, 13.

657
01:23:35,952 --> 01:23:40,480
Doc won the fight.
Why'd he want to kill himself?

658
01:23:41,124 --> 01:23:43,615
Nothing we can do about it.

659
01:23:45,795 --> 01:23:47,729
Mendoza!

660
01:23:47,931 --> 01:23:50,491
Get to work. We got cattle to load.

661
01:23:50,767 --> 01:23:54,464
We need that next string of cars
right now!

662
01:24:09,319 --> 01:24:14,450
- You just don't give a damn, do you?
- You're a fine one to talk.

663
01:24:14,691 --> 01:24:19,822
You buried a man once. "In the long
run, it doesn't make a difference."

664
01:24:20,163 --> 01:24:24,793
Maybe watching you
made me change my mind.

665
01:24:25,001 --> 01:24:27,993
If you had anything inside
worth saving...

666
01:24:28,204 --> 01:24:32,470
...l'd beat you down,
but you'll never learn.

667
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:39,145
You haven't gotten tough,
you've just gotten miserable.

668
01:25:08,845 --> 01:25:11,712
Boss, we're gonna lose some cattle.

669
01:25:11,981 --> 01:25:16,213
We got three down steers
in one car and two in the next.

670
01:25:16,419 --> 01:25:19,081
Harris, give Capper a hand.

671
01:25:59,462 --> 01:26:03,762
- There's four down now, see them?
- I see them.

672
01:26:05,435 --> 01:26:09,565
Are you crazy? Those cows
will rip your belly open.

673
01:26:09,806 --> 01:26:13,298
- I wouldn't go in there.
- They're not your cows.

674
01:26:40,336 --> 01:26:43,464
I have to laugh. You made him tough.

675
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:46,675
Now you don't like what you made.

676
01:26:46,909 --> 01:26:48,399
Know what I think?

677
01:26:48,678 --> 01:26:52,011
He'd have been all right
if not for that girl.

678
01:26:52,281 --> 01:26:54,181
Come on, play.

679
01:26:55,485 --> 01:26:58,579
Well, he learned how to handle cows...

680
01:26:58,821 --> 01:27:03,315
...maybe he'll learn
how to handle women.

681
01:27:03,826 --> 01:27:05,259
Ain't my business...

682
01:27:05,461 --> 01:27:09,625
...but that crazy Harris
is prying cattle off the floor.

683
01:27:09,832 --> 01:27:15,668
- What did you leave him there for?
- I ain't the ramrod here, he is.

684
01:27:19,642 --> 01:27:23,601
- Where are you going?
- I'm tired of burying people.

685
01:29:26,802 --> 01:29:29,999
I suppose this is one of mine, huh?

686
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:33,299
It all depends on if we can save it.

687
01:29:34,010 --> 01:29:35,739
Come on, let's go!

688
01:29:57,433 --> 01:30:01,494
Miserable slab-sided fleabags!

689
01:30:04,273 --> 01:30:05,934
Listen...

690
01:30:06,375 --> 01:30:10,778
...about those cattle we lost.
Maybe I made a mistake.

691
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:16,008
- Yeah?
- I don't think they were all yours.

692
01:30:16,218 --> 01:30:18,880
I'd say about fifty-fifty.

693
01:30:19,155 --> 01:30:22,147
That sounds like a fair split.

694
01:30:23,492 --> 01:30:25,119
Come on, let's go.

695
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:37,671
- Good to see you again.
- Good to be here.

696
01:30:37,907 --> 01:30:43,004
- Meet my partner, Frank Harris.
- Hello, Fowler, how are you?

697
01:30:43,245 --> 01:30:47,341
Take care of him. He used to be
in the hotel business.

698
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:49,984
- I have your rooms all ready.
- Fine.

699
01:30:50,219 --> 01:30:52,050
How long will you stay?

700
01:30:52,321 --> 01:30:56,223
One week, maybe.
Two weeks, if it's all right...

701
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:11,569
- Make it three.
- Ring for anything you want.

702
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:15,902
- Plenty of hot water and whiskey.
- Make that double.

703
01:31:23,953 --> 01:31:25,545
Pour it in, son.

704
01:31:25,788 --> 01:31:28,951
- Tom.
- Frank.
