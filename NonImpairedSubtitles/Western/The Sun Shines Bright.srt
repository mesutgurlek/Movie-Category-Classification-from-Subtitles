1
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:41,590
Jeff!

2
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:43,960
Jeff!

3
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,024
Where is that good-for-nothing boy?!

4
00:03:15,758 --> 00:03:17,148
Jeff!

5
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:18,917
Jeff!

6
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:31,928
I'm comin'...yes, I'm comin'.

7
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:35,327
Come on...reach under the bed
and get it for me.

8
00:03:35,327 --> 00:03:38,729
I was just gettin' ready
to reach under there. My!

9
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:42,419
Why do I have to tell you every morning
to reach under the bed for it?!

10
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:46,553
Ah just got a little glass for you.

11
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:51,961
More power to your elbow, Judge!

12
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:55,463
I got to take this every morning.

13
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:58,376
Mind you...not as an indulgence.

14
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:00,904
Merely to get my heart started.

15
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:11,017
It's good, Judge?

16
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:17,590
The election comin' on...

17
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,375
...you'd have to tear my tongue out
by the roots, 'fore I'd tell it.

18
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,975
- Is my bath ready?
- Yeah.

19
00:04:22,975 --> 00:04:24,497
Oh, I've left the...

20
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,762
We goin' to be late for court,
ain't we Judge?

21
00:04:57,204 --> 00:04:59,269
Oh, Mr Maydew can wait.

22
00:04:59,985 --> 00:05:01,666
But we late already.

23
00:05:29,265 --> 00:05:30,585
Billy!

24
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:34,232
Judge Priest!

25
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:40,911
Well, if it isn't Aurora Ratchitt!

26
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:43,328
Goddess of the dawn!

27
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:46,023
A sight for sore eyes!

28
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:49,563
My friend, Dora May Plumb, from Covington.

29
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:50,948
How do you do!

30
00:05:50,948 --> 00:05:51,908
Covington?!

31
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,269
Fine town!

32
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,111
Outside of my judicial circuit.

33
00:05:56,436 --> 00:05:58,757
But you're in mighty fine company!

34
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:03,866
I always think of Ebenezer Ratchitt...

35
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:08,062
...the day he lead that last charge at Shiloh!

36
00:06:08,557 --> 00:06:11,550
There was a gallant trooper, your father.

37
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,296
You know, there went a man of quality.

38
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:18,253
There went the flower of the South!

39
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:23,785
You do say the most overpowerin' things, Judge!

40
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:25,075
Thank you!

41
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,304
And as a friend of your father,
seeking re-election to the Circuit Court...

42
00:06:30,304 --> 00:06:31,967
...for Fairfield County...

43
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:37,036
...would you mind passing these things
out among your friends.

44
00:06:37,036 --> 00:06:39,578
I'll go from door to door, Judge!

45
00:06:39,578 --> 00:06:42,022
Door to door!

46
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,309
Thank you...thank you!

47
00:06:50,092 --> 00:06:50,883
Judge...

48
00:06:50,883 --> 00:06:53,068
Do my eyes deceive me?

49
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:57,010
No Judge, that's Mr Ashby Corwin!

50
00:06:57,653 --> 00:07:00,097
Back home at last!

51
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:06,375
Ashby Corwin!

52
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,921
Ashby Corwin.

53
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:23,873
Boss Ashby!

54
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:26,534
Boss Ashby!

55
00:07:26,534 --> 00:07:28,585
Boss Ashby!

56
00:08:03,636 --> 00:08:05,559
Nice to see you again, Dr Lake.

57
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:07,684
You're looking well, Ashby.

58
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:08,828
Thank you, sir.

59
00:08:10,164 --> 00:08:12,906
And is this pretty little girl,
Miss Lucy Lee?

60
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,376
Yes, I could see you anywhere
in the world and I would say...

61
00:08:18,376 --> 00:08:20,383
"There goes Kentucky"!

62
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:23,891
My daughter is a woman Ashby...
not to say a lady.

63
00:08:23,891 --> 00:08:27,673
Oh, I've grown up quite a lot
since I saw you last, Mr Corwin.

64
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,432
Yes, you were just a child
when I last saw you.

65
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,845
But then, we're ALL Dr Lake's children.

66
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,225
What's the count, now, Doctor?

67
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:41,139
I have ushered 5,322 babies
into this vale of tears, Ashby.

68
00:08:41,665 --> 00:08:43,771
And I'm the blackest sheep
of the lot!

69
00:08:44,153 --> 00:08:45,137
It's a pleasure.

70
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:51,729
Mr Ashby!

71
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,666
Isn't this Uncle Zack?

72
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,440
It sure is, sir!

73
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,437
You standin' mighty good, sir!

74
00:08:58,094 --> 00:08:59,390
Still at the livery stable, Uncle Zack?

75
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:03,854
No sir, Ces is gettin' kinda old...
Sort o' let me go.

76
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:06,068
Let you go?
Well I still own it, don't I?

77
00:09:06,068 --> 00:09:06,873
Sure do.

78
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:08,617
Well you just take these here
critters down there...

79
00:09:08,617 --> 00:09:10,020
...and tell him you're in charge.

80
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,099
Boss, you have SAID somethin'!

81
00:09:22,683 --> 00:09:24,076
Good morning, Miss Lucy!

82
00:09:24,076 --> 00:09:25,293
G'morning!

83
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:32,132
Glory be!
Mr Ashby's come home again!

84
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:37,414
Thank you Mr Corwin,
for carryin' my books.

85
00:09:47,557 --> 00:09:50,558
Just as I thought...
You're still goin' to school!

86
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:52,587
Yes...I am!

87
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:34,353
Stand up everybody...
The court's now in session.

88
00:10:34,353 --> 00:10:36,174
His Honour approaches the bench.

89
00:10:36,598 --> 00:10:38,796
Doggon it, Billy...
You're late again this mornin'...

90
00:10:38,796 --> 00:10:39,860
Why can't you get here!?

91
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,454
I know Andy, I'm sorry...

92
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:43,130
It's that worthless boy of mine.

93
00:10:43,961 --> 00:10:45,782
He overslept!

94
00:10:45,782 --> 00:10:47,067
He's the one that sleep-in...

95
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:50,154
I was just sleepin'.

96
00:10:57,299 --> 00:10:59,960
Hear ye!...hear ye!...

97
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,388
The 17th District Court
of the Commonwealth...

98
00:11:04,388 --> 00:11:05,621
Mr Solicitor...

99
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:08,415
- Now I ain't finished yet, Judge!
- Sorry.

100
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:13,276
...of Kentucky, is about to convene.

101
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:20,363
Mr Solicitor...are you ready for Mrs Mallie Cramp
to make her plea?

102
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:22,222
If you are...get going.

103
00:11:30,473 --> 00:11:35,983
Indeed Your Honour, it would be repugnant
to every fibre of my being...

104
00:11:35,983 --> 00:11:38,773
Nay!...it would be unethical...

105
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:43,339
...for me to represent the noble people
of Fairfield County in this case.

106
00:11:45,142 --> 00:11:47,201
And your Honour is aware, of course...

107
00:11:47,201 --> 00:11:53,043
...that I have dedicated myself
to eradicating vice and crime in this county.

108
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:58,112
And as I myself will probably be
sitting on that bench...

109
00:11:58,112 --> 00:11:59,592
...after the election...

110
00:11:59,592 --> 00:12:02,981
...I should not like to prejudice myself...

111
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:06,368
...by being a prosecutor
in the same cause.

112
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:15,024
What's next on the docket?

113
00:12:17,263 --> 00:12:19,764
We have here a noble old man...

114
00:12:19,764 --> 00:12:22,430
...whose nephew refuses to support him.

115
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:26,868
Mr Maydew...I didn't say
my boy HAD to support me...

116
00:12:27,523 --> 00:12:28,365
...I was just...

117
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:30,675
Mr Sheriff...can't you keep 
this courtroom in order?!

118
00:12:30,675 --> 00:12:32,695
Sit down and shut up, uncle, please. 

119
00:12:33,538 --> 00:12:34,946
One moment, gentlemen.

120
00:12:35,911 --> 00:12:37,109
Uncle Plez...

121
00:12:38,213 --> 00:12:40,118
Did I hear you called Uncle Plez?

122
00:12:40,118 --> 00:12:41,567
Yessir, Judge.

123
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:43,166
Uncle Pleasant Woodford.

124
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,758
Thank you.
Come here.

125
00:12:52,593 --> 00:12:57,564
Are you the boy that brought Bainbridge Corwin's body 
back from Chickamauga?

126
00:12:57,564 --> 00:12:59,938
Yessir Judge...you remember.

127
00:12:59,938 --> 00:13:01,979
I brought him all the way back...

128
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:03,711
...in these two arms.

129
00:13:03,711 --> 00:13:05,477
Don't you remember?

130
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:07,238
Yes I do.

131
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,353
Oh, what a time that was!

132
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:17,972
What's the matter with your boy, 
Uncle Pleasant.

133
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:19,724
Nothin' Judge, nothin'...

134
00:13:19,724 --> 00:13:23,700
He just sit around the house 
and play the banjo all day long!

135
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:26,836
Just idlin' on the levee.

136
00:13:26,836 --> 00:13:29,095
This boy got to learn a trade.

137
00:13:29,095 --> 00:13:32,788
Trade? He got a trade, Judge!

138
00:13:32,788 --> 00:13:37,393
That boy could run away right now,
with his old plantation music.

139
00:13:37,393 --> 00:13:39,445
With his banjo...

140
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:41,182
Your name, boy?!

141
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:43,715
U.S. Woodford, sir.

142
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:47,015
Where did you get that name "U.S."?

143
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:49,734
My full name is U.S. Grant Woodford.

144
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:52,110
One of the gentlemans at the G.A.R. Hall say...

145
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,251
..."Here the Yankee general 
might be General Robert E. Lee".

146
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,246
Mr Maydew...

147
00:14:02,626 --> 00:14:03,462
If you please!

148
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:08,116
Let me hear you play, boy.

149
00:14:08,116 --> 00:14:09,482
Yes sir!

150
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,261
Play a military tune.

151
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:15,169
Here's one they taught me 
when I cleaned up the G.A.R. Hall.

152
00:14:40,805 --> 00:14:44,178
Your string is off the key and you can't
play out of tune for the judge!

153
00:14:44,178 --> 00:14:47,104
You fix that string up 
and wish you were in The Land of Cotton...

154
00:14:47,104 --> 00:14:49,835
...old time and not forgotten...
and look away in Dixie Land...

155
00:15:32,987 --> 00:15:36,002
I swear my hearin's gettin' so poorly...

156
00:15:37,242 --> 00:15:39,477
I'd 've sworn I heard a band playin' "Dixie."

157
00:15:41,176 --> 00:15:43,987
Reminds me of that 
Second Battle of Manassas.

158
00:15:44,894 --> 00:15:47,639
The one that you Yankees 
call Bull Run.

159
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:51,077
I caught the end of it.

160
00:17:02,715 --> 00:17:04,157
Order in the court!

161
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:05,025
Order!

162
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:09,323
Now if there's any more disturbance, 
I shall have to clear the courtroom.

163
00:17:12,888 --> 00:17:14,078
Sit down, gentlemen.

164
00:17:20,528 --> 00:17:25,629
Now, I want you to mind Uncle Plez.

165
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:28,115
And stop lounging around the levee.

166
00:17:28,543 --> 00:17:29,825
Yessir, Judge sir.

167
00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:33,295
They're tying tobacco 
up in the Tornado District...

168
00:17:33,295 --> 00:17:34,724
...curing burley...

169
00:17:35,372 --> 00:17:39,427
Now you go up there, and learn 
some useful work with those hands.

170
00:17:39,427 --> 00:17:40,393
You hear that, boy?

171
00:17:41,237 --> 00:17:45,130
Of course...
don't risk them wonderful fingers of yours...

172
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,511
...around the corn-sheller...

173
00:17:46,511 --> 00:17:48,279
...or a band-saw...

174
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:53,912
You just go out there and tell them 
that Judge Priest sent you...

175
00:17:53,912 --> 00:17:55,387
...to help his old friends.

176
00:17:55,387 --> 00:17:58,061
Go on up there and tell everybody.

177
00:17:58,061 --> 00:17:59,978
- Thank you, Judge.
- Thank you kindly, Judge.

178
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,928
Justice is indeed blind...

179
00:18:02,928 --> 00:18:07,839
...when her impartial scales are so loaded 
against the will of the people.

180
00:18:08,471 --> 00:18:10,478
Mr Maydew...

181
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:16,579
It is the pleasure of this court 
to hear the plea of Mrs Mallie Cramp.

182
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:18,791
Or shall I judge you in contempt?!

183
00:18:25,243 --> 00:18:25,959
Mallie Cramp!

184
00:18:28,353 --> 00:18:30,092
Mallie...on your feet.

185
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:43,752
Alright Mallie...what do you plead?

186
00:18:43,752 --> 00:18:45,719
One moment, Mr Maydew!

187
00:18:47,415 --> 00:18:48,788
Please be seated, Mrs Cramp.

188
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:11,417
Well I hope you get the general to come.

189
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:14,261
I'll do my best, comrade,
I'll do my best.

190
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:24,014
William Pittman Priest, 
to see the general.

191
00:19:30,156 --> 00:19:31,820
Time for the "priest", General.

192
00:19:49,437 --> 00:19:50,810
General Fairfield...

193
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,550
On behalf of the Gideon K.I.R Encampment...

194
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,602
...The United Confederate Veterans...

195
00:19:56,602 --> 00:20:01,086
...I bring our old commander,
our devotion and respects.

196
00:20:01,086 --> 00:20:03,608
Thank them for me, 
Trumpeter Priest.

197
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:08,121
It would do their hearts good if you came 
and thanked them in person, General.

198
00:20:08,764 --> 00:20:11,027
My carriage awaits your pleasure.

199
00:20:11,027 --> 00:20:14,513
I spoke the final word on that, 
18 years ago...

200
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,288
...when Dr Lake brought back that girl.

201
00:20:18,344 --> 00:20:19,877
It is your granddaughter, sir.

202
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:22,063
That sir, I deny.

203
00:20:22,776 --> 00:20:24,557
Goodnight, Trumpeter Priest.

204
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:30,117
Billy!...

205
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:40,187
Little Billy Priest...

206
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:45,987
You'll loom large in my memoirs.

207
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:48,407
Thank you, General.

208
00:20:50,611 --> 00:20:51,895
Thank you kindly.

209
00:21:23,527 --> 00:21:25,059
Honour Guard!

210
00:21:26,058 --> 00:21:27,784
Advance the colours.

211
00:21:53,623 --> 00:21:55,970
To the flag of our glorious republic!

212
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,381
Right hand...salute!

213
00:22:03,687 --> 00:22:05,721
Gashed with honourable scars...

214
00:22:05,721 --> 00:22:07,558
Low in glory's lap they lie...

215
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:10,396
Although they fell, 
they fell like stars...

216
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:13,236
...streaming splendour 
through the sky.

217
00:22:14,164 --> 00:22:15,330
Cover!

218
00:22:37,197 --> 00:22:38,891
The Gideon K.I.R's Encampment...

219
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,924
The United Confederate Veterans...

220
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:43,532
...will now come to order.

221
00:22:45,891 --> 00:22:48,288
Our illustrious general...

222
00:22:48,288 --> 00:22:51,014
...regrets that he cannot attend tonight.

223
00:22:51,014 --> 00:22:53,915
He asked me to convey his compliments...

224
00:22:54,727 --> 00:22:58,878
...to the men of the old Fairfield Brigade 
of Forest Cavalry.

225
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,614
I'm glad you could come, comrades!

226
00:23:20,614 --> 00:23:22,743
Come in...sit down...sit down!

227
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:25,301
How's the baccy crop, out your way?

228
00:23:28,077 --> 00:23:31,036
Come in...sit down...sit down.

229
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:39,294
Judge, are you goin' let those boys 
shout it over me?

230
00:23:40,473 --> 00:23:42,607
Well, that's Finney...is that Little Mink?

231
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:50,892
He must've been all of 8 years old!

232
00:23:57,988 --> 00:24:02,325
And now comrades, we have some 
very important business to conduct.

233
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:04,110
Lewt.

234
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:11,899
Now all of you as wear eyeglasses...

235
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:16,211
I want you to come forward 
and inspect the picture...

236
00:24:16,211 --> 00:24:18,257
...of General Fairfield, closely.

237
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:22,307
And them as ain't got glasses
can borrow from them that has.

238
00:24:39,392 --> 00:24:41,384
Doctor's daughter will be in this room...

239
00:24:41,384 --> 00:24:42,785
...next decoration day.

240
00:24:43,374 --> 00:24:46,679
She can't fail to recognise the lady 
as her grandmother.

241
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:50,769
The general is prepared 
to deny the relationship.

242
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:54,322
Just the same...
It proves beyond doubt...

243
00:24:54,322 --> 00:24:58,661
...that we have preserved the last bud 
of the Fairfield tree.

244
00:24:58,661 --> 00:25:00,322
The portrait must come down.

245
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:03,918
What is your opinion, gentlemen?

246
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:07,048
Judge, I think you better send it 
to your house tonight.

247
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:09,106
Better take it down, Judge.

248
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,476
Very well.

249
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:13,354
Jeff, see that the portrait 
goes to my house tonight.

250
00:25:25,728 --> 00:25:26,978
The meeting will come to order.

251
00:25:32,116 --> 00:25:37,092
I have here a letter, published 
under the name of Horace K. Maydew...

252
00:25:37,092 --> 00:25:39,360
...my opponent in the coming election.

253
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,116
A point of order, please!

254
00:25:41,116 --> 00:25:44,948
It is a fixed resolve of this encampment...

255
00:25:44,948 --> 00:25:47,164
...that politics must never...

256
00:25:47,164 --> 00:25:48,943
This ain't politics!

257
00:25:48,943 --> 00:25:50,828
It's a deliberate liable.

258
00:25:52,413 --> 00:25:53,882
What's liable?

259
00:25:56,081 --> 00:25:59,701
"How long will the progressive 
and up-to-date city of Fairfield..."

260
00:25:59,701 --> 00:26:02,941
"....be subject to Confederate rule?"

261
00:26:04,756 --> 00:26:09,478
"To the sentimental appeal 
of empty sleeve and timber-toe?"

262
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:14,185
"To the doddering relics of a lost cause?"

263
00:26:17,371 --> 00:26:23,376
"To the machine headed by the whisky-drinking 
William Pittman Priest..."

264
00:26:26,806 --> 00:26:30,879
"An ignorant horse-doctor, Lewt Lake."

265
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:38,326
"An illiterate braggart of unknown antecedance..."

266
00:26:38,326 --> 00:26:41,509
"Sergeant Jimmy Bagby."

267
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:53,473
All that's left of us is here.

268
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,031
Maybe it's a hant...

269
00:26:58,219 --> 00:26:59,354
..a ghost.

270
00:27:00,967 --> 00:27:02,333
See who's at the door, Jeff.

271
00:27:26,235 --> 00:27:28,272
Mr Joe D. Habersham, Judge...

272
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,537
Mr Joe D. Habersham.

273
00:27:33,404 --> 00:27:35,898
Judge, I don't want to intrude 
on your encampment...

274
00:27:35,898 --> 00:27:40,029
...but somebody stole our flag
from the Juliana Hall.

275
00:27:43,442 --> 00:27:47,051
And you can't open your meeting, 
until you salute it the way we do.

276
00:27:47,357 --> 00:27:48,630
That's right, sir.

277
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:51,449
As strange as it seems, gentlemen...

278
00:27:51,449 --> 00:27:55,017
...it was a spanking brand new flag...

279
00:27:55,017 --> 00:27:57,311
...exactly like this one.

280
00:27:58,322 --> 00:28:00,229
One country...one flag.

281
00:28:00,229 --> 00:28:04,943
Comrades, shall we send Sergeant Bagby

282
00:28:04,943 --> 00:28:06,298
...as a colour-guard of honour?

283
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:09,065
Judge, I ain't ever give up 
no captured Yankee flag yet...

284
00:28:09,065 --> 00:28:10,483
...and I don't aim to start now!

285
00:28:10,483 --> 00:28:14,870
He'd be only to glad to act 
as a colour guard for your...our flag.

286
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:18,792
There are time, yes, when politics 
should be forgotten.

287
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:20,847
That's mighty handsome of you, Judge...

288
00:28:20,847 --> 00:28:22,147
Mighty handsome.

289
00:28:22,147 --> 00:28:23,910
Thank you, Joe D.
Thank you.

290
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,520
I declare, Billy...
I like you so much, personally...

291
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,436
...I wish I could vote for you.

292
00:28:28,436 --> 00:28:30,892
No politics, Joe...
No politics!

293
00:28:30,892 --> 00:28:33,385
Being a member of the 
Grand Army of the Republic...

294
00:28:33,385 --> 00:28:37,013
I'd just as lief cut my throat,
as to vote for a Democrat.

295
00:28:37,013 --> 00:28:40,712
This is no time for political matters.

296
00:28:40,712 --> 00:28:43,219
Forward...march!

297
00:28:50,078 --> 00:28:53,373
<i>Hurrah, hurrah we bring the jubilee</i>

298
00:28:53,373 --> 00:28:57,614
<i>Hurrah! Hurrah! the flag that makes you free!</i>

299
00:28:57,614 --> 00:29:01,604
<i>So we sang the chorus from Atlanta to the sea</i>

300
00:29:01,604 --> 00:29:05,852
<i>While we were marching through Georgia.</i>

301
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,034
Atten...shun!

302
00:29:40,602 --> 00:29:41,534
Gentlemen...

303
00:29:41,534 --> 00:29:46,241
Judge Priest, on behalf of his encampment...

304
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:50,630
...has kindly consented 
to lend us THEIR flag.

305
00:29:57,605 --> 00:30:00,297
I suppose seeing those captured 
Confederate flags...

306
00:30:00,297 --> 00:30:02,746
...is like a snake-bite to YOU, Judge.

307
00:30:04,785 --> 00:30:05,377
Gentlemen...

308
00:30:05,377 --> 00:30:10,227
I propose that we offer Judge Priest 
an antidote for snake-bite.

309
00:30:14,088 --> 00:30:14,861
Gentlemen...

310
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:22,006
Those Confederate flags...
and OUR national standard...

311
00:30:22,006 --> 00:30:25,409
...are what has made this Union great.

312
00:30:28,951 --> 00:30:30,129
In what other country...

313
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:33,206
...could a man who fought against you...

314
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:37,190
...be permitted to serve 
as judge over you...

315
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:41,117
...be permitted to run for re-election!

316
00:30:41,952 --> 00:30:46,822
...and bespeak your suffrage 
on Tuesday next, at the polls.

317
00:30:50,111 --> 00:30:56,729
I see before me, some of the bravest men 
that rode for Phil Sheridan.

318
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,457
While I was rather well-know myself, 
in Forest Cavalry...

319
00:31:07,578 --> 00:31:09,787
But you'll find the records 
on these cards...

320
00:31:10,857 --> 00:31:13,291
No politics, tonight, gentlemen...
No politics.

321
00:31:14,494 --> 00:31:21,290
But a perusion of these cards wills show you 
why I stand for law and order...

322
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:27,698
Why I am willing to serve you again 
for another 4 years...

323
00:31:27,698 --> 00:31:34,638
...to prevent Horace K. Maydew
from making a mockery of justice!

324
00:31:37,466 --> 00:31:40,565
I have nothing personal 
against Maydew...

325
00:31:41,701 --> 00:31:47,189
...though you know him to be 
the son of a carpetbagger...

326
00:31:47,189 --> 00:31:48,607
...from Boston...

327
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:51,861
...Who came here to feather his nest...

328
00:31:52,882 --> 00:31:56,047
...before you soldiers who did the fighting...

329
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,861
...could get back home!

330
00:32:03,646 --> 00:32:04,507
Thank you.

331
00:32:06,898 --> 00:32:08,338
The Blue and the Gray...

332
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:14,185
Let us march together...

333
00:32:14,185 --> 00:32:17,785
...beneath The Star-Spangled Banner!

334
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,210
And Tuesday, gentlemen...

335
00:32:23,551 --> 00:32:25,956
Search your conscience!

336
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,846
Goodnight comrades!

337
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:43,869
<i>We're tenting tonight on the old camp ground...</i>

338
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:49,649
<i>Give us a song to cheer.</i>

339
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:56,721
<i>Our weary hearts, a song of home...</i>

340
00:32:56,721 --> 00:33:04,789
<i>And friends we love so dear.</i>

341
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:11,976
<i> Many are the hearts that are weary tonight...</i>

342
00:33:11,976 --> 00:33:18,941
<i>Wishing for the war to cease...</i>

343
00:33:18,941 --> 00:33:27,792
<i> Many are the hearts looking for the right...</i>

344
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:35,628
<i> To see the dawn of peace.</i>

345
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,988
Did you snap a ring?

346
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:33,400
Why, no...it just came unbuckled.

347
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,460
Please...let me buckle it for you.

348
00:34:39,942 --> 00:34:42,490
Oh, it's nothing Mr Corwin...
I can fix it.

349
00:34:49,411 --> 00:34:50,503
Thank you, just the same!

350
00:34:52,503 --> 00:34:53,620
It's a pleasure, ma'am.

351
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:08,739
Mr Ashby...don't you ever let anybody 
see you like this again!

352
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,283
Especially this young lady...

353
00:35:10,283 --> 00:35:12,651
...that everybody's sayin' 
such bad things about...

354
00:35:12,651 --> 00:35:14,777
And especially Mr Buck Ramsey...

355
00:35:14,777 --> 00:35:16,610
that talks so evil about it.

356
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,060
Buck Ramsey?!

357
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,272
Please Mr Ashby...

358
00:35:19,272 --> 00:35:24,022
I just mean when Miss Lucy Lee 
takes the doctor's buggy to the stable every night.

359
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,132
Allow me!

360
00:35:41,836 --> 00:35:43,751
Why don't you take a ride with ME?

361
00:35:43,751 --> 00:35:45,566
Them's my dapple-greys.

362
00:35:45,566 --> 00:35:47,614
Fastest team in Fairfield County.

363
00:35:53,226 --> 00:35:54,580
Ignore them all, Miss Lucy Lee.

364
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,307
Uncle Zack...

365
00:35:55,307 --> 00:35:57,993
Take the little lady home 
and bring the rig back.

366
00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:00,759
You need a young man 
for a job like that, Ashby.

367
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,085
You need ME!

368
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:04,925
No...you got business with ME.

369
00:36:04,925 --> 00:36:06,257
What business?

370
00:36:06,257 --> 00:36:07,648
You and I are goin' 
to the harness room.

371
00:36:07,648 --> 00:36:09,867
We're gonna pick out 
a pair of buggy-whips...

372
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:13,304
..and I'm gonna see if I can whip the dirt 
outta that filthy mouth of yours.

373
00:36:13,751 --> 00:36:15,645
Maybe his friend wanna 
come along with him...

374
00:36:15,645 --> 00:36:17,503
Maybe they got 
a few more snickers.

375
00:37:56,902 --> 00:37:57,744
Buck Ramsey!

376
00:37:58,968 --> 00:38:01,102
If you ain't out of town 
in 5 minutes...

377
00:38:01,102 --> 00:38:03,801
...I'll deputise myself 
and make a citizen's arrest.

378
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:06,703
Now get back to the Tornado District 
where you belong...

379
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:07,748
Now get going!

380
00:38:09,035 --> 00:38:10,232
Uncle Plez...go on home.

381
00:38:12,204 --> 00:38:15,343
And you profligate seed 
of a noble line...

382
00:38:16,031 --> 00:38:19,464
What right have you or anybody else 
to take the law in their hands?

383
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,934
- I'm sorry, Judge.
- Sorry?!

384
00:38:22,194 --> 00:38:25,776
Don't you know that we here in Fairfield 
have a secret to keep?

385
00:38:26,067 --> 00:38:29,865
And you try to lick a bully... 
and start all the tongues waggin' again.

386
00:38:29,865 --> 00:38:32,502
I'm sorry Judge, but when I heard 
he was talkin' about Lucy Lee...

387
00:38:32,502 --> 00:38:33,808
He was telling the truth!

388
00:38:33,808 --> 00:38:37,902
And you can't kill truth 
with a buggy-whip.

389
00:38:37,902 --> 00:38:41,043
- The truth? You mean about Lucy Lee's...
- Yes!

390
00:38:42,832 --> 00:38:47,422
Didn't you know that General Fairfield's son 
was killed by a river gambler...

391
00:38:47,422 --> 00:38:50,246
...in a fight over Lucy Lee's mother?

392
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,373
The matter's closed.

393
00:38:55,408 --> 00:38:58,446
Now get your clothes on 
and go home.

394
00:38:58,446 --> 00:38:59,522
Go on!

395
00:39:45,094 --> 00:39:48,401
There's a hack right here ma'am, that'll take you 
anywhere you want to go.

396
00:39:52,297 --> 00:39:53,324
Hack right here, ma'am.

397
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:56,618
Take you anywhere you want to go in town 
for 2 bits.

398
00:40:00,805 --> 00:40:03,928
White lady lookin' for lodgin'...
better go this way.

399
00:40:12,045 --> 00:40:17,426
Thank you kindly...
I know this town.

400
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:25,271
Here, let me take your bag, ma'am...

401
00:41:25,271 --> 00:41:27,049
No, no...thank you...

402
00:41:27,049 --> 00:41:28,341
Just tell where you want to go...

403
00:41:28,341 --> 00:41:29,723
I'm going to Mallie Cramp's.

404
00:41:29,723 --> 00:41:33,058
And you'd better run along 
like a good little boy.

405
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,367
Zack!

406
00:41:46,441 --> 00:41:47,565
Dr Lake's...quick.

407
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,045
Got a sick woman here, Doc.

408
00:42:13,045 --> 00:42:14,983
- Very sick.
- Bring her right in.

409
00:42:33,673 --> 00:42:34,983
My bag's in the hall, Ashby.

410
00:42:57,345 --> 00:43:00,383
I'm sorry sir...
but I just HAD to bring her here.

411
00:43:00,383 --> 00:43:02,601
Is there any place I wouldn't go,
to visit the sick?

412
00:43:05,444 --> 00:43:08,235
She stumbled off the freight-boat 
from Cincinnati..

413
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,189
Wanted to go to Mallie Cramp's.

414
00:43:15,757 --> 00:43:18,086
But I'm afraid nothing 'll help her along.

415
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:43,473
My baby...

416
00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:48,648
I want to see my baby...

417
00:43:57,612 --> 00:43:59,360
Lucy Lee.

418
00:44:00,716 --> 00:44:02,184
Where's Lucy Lee?

419
00:44:12,028 --> 00:44:16,139
I'm sorry, Dr Lake...
I didn't know.

420
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:31,787
I thought I heard somebody calling me.

421
00:44:52,594 --> 00:44:56,866
Now...take me to Mallie Cramp's.

422
00:45:17,346 --> 00:45:18,919
Jeff!

423
00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:24,952
I declare, that last keg of whisky you got, 
don't set well on my stomach.

424
00:45:24,952 --> 00:45:26,856
I don't know why, Judge...

425
00:45:26,856 --> 00:45:31,878
I got it from the same moonshinin' gentleman 
where I got it before.

426
00:45:32,592 --> 00:45:36,892
Well maybe they aren't sproutin' the grains 
in a cool barn.

427
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:41,825
Sure ain't the kinda corn squeezes 
that my stomach is used to.

428
00:45:48,564 --> 00:45:50,551
Here comes Dr Lake.

429
00:45:51,491 --> 00:45:53,445
Get rid of the jug...
Keep the glass.

430
00:46:06,177 --> 00:46:07,080
What's the trouble?

431
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,710
Somebody came back to town...

432
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:12,424
Collapsed on the way to Mallie Cramp's.

433
00:46:13,405 --> 00:46:14,453
Thunderation!

434
00:46:14,453 --> 00:46:16,821
Ashby Corwin picked her up...

435
00:46:16,821 --> 00:46:18,277
Brought her to my office.

436
00:46:18,277 --> 00:46:20,230
She's in a dying condition...

437
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,252
...at Mallie's.

438
00:46:22,252 --> 00:46:23,846
That's all that's needed...

439
00:46:24,714 --> 00:46:27,149
...You being seen 
going into Mallie's tomorrow.

440
00:46:29,043 --> 00:46:30,859
We'll be turned out of office.

441
00:46:30,859 --> 00:46:32,367
Yes, I think YOU will.

442
00:46:32,367 --> 00:46:36,563
But I intend to visit her, like any other 
sick woman who needs care.

443
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:38,596
I know you will, Doctor.

444
00:46:39,362 --> 00:46:41,372
I'd do the same thing.

445
00:47:28,867 --> 00:47:30,396
Uncle Billy!

446
00:47:30,396 --> 00:47:31,719
Uncle Billy!

447
00:47:40,218 --> 00:47:42,144
I HAD to see you, Judge...

448
00:47:42,144 --> 00:47:43,971
I must know what's going on.

449
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:45,846
Who AM I?

450
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:50,354
I know Daddy Lake loves me 
like a daughter...but...

451
00:47:51,431 --> 00:47:52,871
Tell me, Judge! 

452
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:54,731
Who AM I?

453
00:47:54,731 --> 00:47:57,712
Why, you're his adopted daughter, honey.

454
00:47:58,615 --> 00:48:00,490
That's not enough anymore, Uncle Billy.

455
00:48:01,662 --> 00:48:02,810
You're mine, too.

456
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:04,595
You belong to all of us.

457
00:48:04,595 --> 00:48:09,377
Every man jack 
that ever rode for General...

458
00:48:57,635 --> 00:48:59,038
Thank you, Uncle Billy.

459
00:49:00,439 --> 00:49:02,028
Now I know who I am.

460
00:49:31,266 --> 00:49:32,224
Andy Redcliffe...

461
00:49:32,224 --> 00:49:36,148
...when did you start 
handcuffing children?!

462
00:49:36,148 --> 00:49:40,050
We just got him out 
of the Tornado District in time, Judge.

463
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:42,168
They was braidin' it up for 'im, 
down there.

464
00:49:42,168 --> 00:49:43,994
What did you do, boy?

465
00:49:43,994 --> 00:49:46,168
Nothin' Judge...

466
00:49:46,168 --> 00:49:48,570
Please sir...I didn't do nothin'!

467
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:50,873
We couldn't wait for the girl to identify him.

468
00:49:50,873 --> 00:49:52,995
Then how do you know 
he did anything?

469
00:49:52,995 --> 00:49:54,913
Bloodhounds treed him, Judge.

470
00:49:54,913 --> 00:49:56,765
Bloodhounds!

471
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,209
Let me hear the boy.

472
00:49:59,209 --> 00:50:02,689
I was just walkin' out 
to the old plantation...

473
00:50:02,689 --> 00:50:04,651
Like you told me...

474
00:50:04,651 --> 00:50:07,059
To help with the tobacco-tyin', Judge!

475
00:50:08,429 --> 00:50:11,025
Them dogs spied me, 
and I started runnin'.

476
00:50:11,025 --> 00:50:13,615
I made it to the piney woods...

477
00:50:13,615 --> 00:50:15,293
But they kept gainin'!

478
00:50:15,293 --> 00:50:17,173
So I climbed a tree.

479
00:50:20,722 --> 00:50:24,565
The dogs kept leapin' 
and snappin' at my heels.

480
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:27,774
Then these white gentlemens came 
and took me down.

481
00:50:29,385 --> 00:50:31,495
Lots of white gentlemens 
were comin' up the road...

482
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:32,750
...hollerin'.

483
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:35,845
Lucky for him, we were so close 
to them bloodhounds.

484
00:50:37,173 --> 00:50:39,585
Andy, you know a bloodhound's a fool dog.

485
00:50:41,321 --> 00:50:42,694
This boy may be guilty...

486
00:50:42,694 --> 00:50:48,070
Then again, it may be a case of mistaken identity
on the part of the bloodhounds.

487
00:50:50,419 --> 00:50:54,385
Now you take this boy to a clean cell...
and take care of him.

488
00:50:55,433 --> 00:51:00,607
Uncle Plez, Mr Burnham will let you 
carry his vittles from the Corwins.

489
00:51:01,566 --> 00:51:05,161
Boy...you'll have a fair trial.

490
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:07,539
Race, creed or colour...

491
00:51:08,412 --> 00:51:10,858
Justice will be done in my courtroom.

492
00:51:10,858 --> 00:51:15,655
And Andy Radcliffe...stop being 
such a dad-blasted fool!

493
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:16,829
Get your men together...

494
00:51:16,829 --> 00:51:19,003
Go out there 
and find the right man.

495
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:23,039
And stop chasing children around.

496
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:24,533
Yessir, Judge.

497
00:52:23,325 --> 00:52:25,200
Hey, Judge...

498
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,203
They're comin' to get that boy...

499
00:52:30,203 --> 00:52:30,787
What?!

500
00:52:30,787 --> 00:52:32,088
Goin' plumb lynchin'...

501
00:52:32,758 --> 00:52:35,747
Grass rope...knot...pine torches...

502
00:52:35,747 --> 00:52:38,085
Got firin' pieces...belts...

503
00:52:38,168 --> 00:52:40,943
Telegram the governor 
and get some soldiers...

504
00:52:40,943 --> 00:52:42,307
Get a whole lot o' soldiers!

505
00:52:42,307 --> 00:52:44,013
We ain't got time for soldiers.

506
00:53:05,654 --> 00:53:08,452
Jake!...Jake Viner!...

507
00:53:11,858 --> 00:53:13,014
Jake!

508
00:53:13,014 --> 00:53:15,693
Mr Viner...he run away, Judge.

509
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:19,983
Well I ain't gonna run away, son.

510
00:53:24,127 --> 00:53:26,195
Judge...can I stay, too.

511
00:53:28,407 --> 00:53:30,125
Yeah, you stay, Uncle Plez.

512
00:53:48,817 --> 00:53:49,989
Hey...there he is, Pa!

513
00:54:07,073 --> 00:54:09,477
Boys, I want to have 
a little talk with you.

514
00:54:09,477 --> 00:54:11,155
It ain't gonna do you no good, Judge.

515
00:54:11,155 --> 00:54:12,941
We come after this boy!

516
00:54:13,729 --> 00:54:16,053
Boys...you're all my friends.

517
00:54:16,053 --> 00:54:20,378
I eat vittles in your homes
when I'm campaigning.

518
00:54:20,378 --> 00:54:22,664
Get outta my way, Billy Priest!

519
00:54:22,664 --> 00:54:24,967
You ain't gonna hold no fair trial...

520
00:54:24,967 --> 00:54:28,092
...and drag my poor little gal's name 
through open court.

521
00:54:28,092 --> 00:54:31,346
It's being dragged more, this way, Rufe.

522
00:54:31,346 --> 00:54:33,001
You can see that, can't you?

523
00:54:34,397 --> 00:54:37,947
Is that the 'Krag Jørgensen' 
that Teddy Roosevelt gave you?

524
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:39,929
Why yes, Judge.

525
00:54:39,929 --> 00:54:41,283
It sure is.

526
00:54:41,283 --> 00:54:45,538
And you used it at San Juan Hill...
defending liberty.

527
00:54:46,878 --> 00:54:48,983
Now you want to destroy it.

528
00:54:48,983 --> 00:54:51,739
We come after that boy, Judge.

529
00:54:51,739 --> 00:54:53,207
We don't aim to do you no harm.

530
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:57,435
I know you don't, Buck...
I know you don't.

531
00:55:14,966 --> 00:55:17,652
I don't want to threaten you 
with this deadline...

532
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:20,884
I just want to reason with you.

533
00:55:22,334 --> 00:55:24,809
That boy ain't been identified yet.

534
00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:26,880
These dogs identified him, 
didn't they?!

535
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,450
Sure!

536
00:55:29,737 --> 00:55:33,425
All you've got is the word 
of a fool dog.

537
00:55:33,425 --> 00:55:35,351
It's been my experience...

538
00:55:36,274 --> 00:55:40,961
...that a bloodhound 
is the foolishest dog that is.

539
00:55:41,997 --> 00:55:46,628
I don't remember of anybody ever 
keeping a bloodhound for a yard dog.

540
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:50,139
They're such dad-blasted fools!

541
00:55:50,667 --> 00:55:53,552
Judge...we came here 
to hang that there boy...

542
00:55:53,552 --> 00:55:55,214
Now don't you be goin' ahead...

543
00:55:55,214 --> 00:55:57,015
...and doin' somthin' 
you are gonna feel sorry for.

544
00:55:57,015 --> 00:55:59,795
Beaker, I aim to conduct myself...

545
00:55:59,795 --> 00:56:03,344
...so that YOU 'll vote for me, 
come next Tuesday.

546
00:56:03,344 --> 00:56:05,637
Get out of our way...
and we'll ALL vote for you.

547
00:56:06,611 --> 00:56:08,136
Yeah, Judge...course we will!

548
00:56:10,507 --> 00:56:12,598
If that's the price of your support...

549
00:56:14,223 --> 00:56:16,987
...I won't pay it!

550
00:56:17,881 --> 00:56:19,571
Come on...let's tear down the jail!

551
00:56:21,227 --> 00:56:24,705
I'll kill the first man 
that crosses that line.

552
00:56:25,985 --> 00:56:29,507
I don't know which one of you 
is gonna kill me...

553
00:56:29,507 --> 00:56:32,796
But I know which one of you, 
I'm gonna kill.

554
00:56:34,116 --> 00:56:36,325
I don't want to kill you, Judge.

555
00:56:36,325 --> 00:56:38,789
I don't want to kill anybody.

556
00:56:39,835 --> 00:56:42,018
But so help me God...

557
00:56:42,018 --> 00:56:45,175
I'll kill the first man 
that crosses that line.

558
00:56:45,876 --> 00:56:48,442
Even if it was my own brother, 
I'd kill him.

559
00:56:50,316 --> 00:56:53,710
You seem to be the leader 
of this thing, Buck Ramsey...

560
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:58,948
Just cross that line 
and get yourself killed.

561
00:57:00,263 --> 00:57:02,574
Come on...come on!

562
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:09,763
Look at them fool dogs...

563
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:13,033
They know they ain't found 
the real criminal yet.

564
00:57:13,645 --> 00:57:15,962
Come on, Pa...
Let's get on home.

565
00:57:17,555 --> 00:57:18,811
Billy Priest...

566
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:21,391
I rode alongside of you, 
and I fought alongside of you.

567
00:57:21,391 --> 00:57:23,702
But you're gonna live to regret this.

568
00:57:31,257 --> 00:57:34,190
Uncle Plez...take this key 
and go to my chambers.

569
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:36,058
And look in my waste basket...

570
00:57:36,058 --> 00:57:38,464
You'll find a brown jug there.

571
00:57:38,464 --> 00:57:40,577
Bring it to me downstairs.

572
00:57:41,381 --> 00:57:43,522
I gotta get my heart started.

573
00:57:48,459 --> 00:57:50,394
Get goin', Pleasant!
Get goin'!

574
00:57:50,394 --> 00:57:51,775
Yes, Judge, I'm flyin'!

575
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,488
I'd do anything for YOU, judge!

576
00:57:56,884 --> 00:57:58,413
I know, boy...I know!

577
00:58:01,105 --> 00:58:03,353
But you're too young to vote.

578
00:58:20,446 --> 00:58:21,891
<i>Du Liebe, bitte! </i>

579
00:58:22,898 --> 00:58:26,384
After tomorrow...
we all be out of office...

580
00:58:26,384 --> 00:58:28,023
A new sheriff...

581
00:58:29,093 --> 00:58:31,331
a new county physician...

582
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:33,753
a new dog-catcher...

583
00:58:34,787 --> 00:58:39,051
And positively, a new circuit judge.

584
00:58:39,051 --> 00:58:41,480
I wouldn't make any bets on that, Hermann.

585
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,582
How can you be...

586
00:58:44,582 --> 00:58:47,513
...after the spectacle 
you make of yourself...

587
00:58:47,513 --> 00:58:49,286
...in front of the jail.

588
00:58:50,498 --> 00:58:52,708
You didn't believe in what I did?!

589
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:54,413
Believe in it?!

590
00:58:54,413 --> 00:58:56,595
<i>Diese ehrliche Junge!</i>

591
00:58:56,595 --> 00:59:01,669
I would lay down my life
for the principles you've just defended.

592
00:59:01,669 --> 00:59:03,608
I...of all people!

593
00:59:03,608 --> 00:59:07,582
That's why I'm saying, 
you should have deputised ME!

594
00:59:07,582 --> 00:59:09,886
I'm not running for re-election.

595
00:59:11,997 --> 00:59:17,287
And YOU have been seen entering 
Mallie Cramp's establishment.

596
00:59:18,867 --> 00:59:20,877
And YOU had gone fishing.

597
00:59:21,575 --> 00:59:24,792
And where were YOU...
Mr Dog-catcher?

598
00:59:25,564 --> 00:59:29,026
I'd 've been right up there with the judge,
if my wife hadn't hid my britches!

599
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:39,587
What departments I shall have 
when you are all turned out of office!

600
00:59:40,367 --> 00:59:44,707
12 Confederate veterans 
in the 'Ladies Underwear'.

601
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:22,740
Judge...please may I speak...?

602
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,483
Won't you come in, Mrs Cramp.

603
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:28,105
You'll be more comfortable 
in the living room.

604
01:00:28,105 --> 01:00:30,660
Oh, the doctor.

605
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,683
I'm profoundly sorry.

606
01:00:38,602 --> 01:00:41,468
I'm ordering a sign painter tomorrow.

607
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:46,151
"All goods in this store, half price"

608
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:49,508
"Owner going out of business"

609
01:00:51,323 --> 01:00:53,567
Come right in, Mrs Cramp.

610
01:00:55,939 --> 01:00:57,451
Make yourself comfortable.

611
01:01:00,662 --> 01:01:01,965
Sit down...sit down!

612
01:01:07,703 --> 01:01:11,429
Mrs Cramp...what can I do 
to serve you?

613
01:01:11,429 --> 01:01:13,505
That poor little thing!

614
01:01:13,505 --> 01:01:16,295
Just before she passed away...

615
01:01:17,395 --> 01:01:18,738
I HAD to come to you, Judge!

616
01:01:19,361 --> 01:01:20,704
Because you're a GOOD man.

617
01:01:22,101 --> 01:01:24,903
Every time they haul me in to court 
to fine me...

618
01:01:24,903 --> 01:01:28,228
You always show me a chair 
and call me Ms Cramp.

619
01:01:30,163 --> 01:01:33,155
That poor little thing 
was a GOOD woman, Judge.

620
01:01:34,261 --> 01:01:37,275
But she just sort of let life 
get the upper hand.

621
01:01:38,827 --> 01:01:40,413
She was born here...

622
01:01:40,413 --> 01:01:42,803
...and she wanted 
to be buried here.

623
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:48,266
I promised her on her deathbed...

624
01:01:48,266 --> 01:01:50,391
...she'll have a funeral...

625
01:01:51,527 --> 01:01:52,897
...in a church...

626
01:01:53,987 --> 01:01:55,481
...with flowers.

627
01:01:56,753 --> 01:02:00,349
And the sun streamin' through 
a pretty window on her coffin.

628
01:02:02,165 --> 01:02:05,113
And a hearse, with plumes...

629
01:02:05,113 --> 01:02:07,371
...and some hacks.

630
01:02:08,941 --> 01:02:11,197
And a preacher to read The Bible.

631
01:02:13,416 --> 01:02:17,237
And folks there in church 
to pray for her soul.

632
01:02:18,329 --> 01:02:20,979
Have you done been 
to a preacher, yet, ma'am?

633
01:02:20,979 --> 01:02:23,943
Well, I daren't...I just daren't.

634
01:02:24,601 --> 01:02:26,075
It would ruin him.

635
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,711
It would ruin ANY preacher!

636
01:02:30,609 --> 01:02:32,573
It would ruin ANY man.

637
01:02:48,479 --> 01:02:50,692
I know I shouldn't 've come here, Judge...

638
01:02:51,757 --> 01:02:54,535
Seein' as how you're mixed up 
in the election tomorrow.

639
01:02:56,049 --> 01:02:59,420
Why, ma'am...
Politics never even entered my head!

640
01:03:00,481 --> 01:03:02,741
There ain't any worry 
about money.

641
01:03:02,741 --> 01:03:05,023
I'm able...

642
01:03:05,023 --> 01:03:06,539
I'm plenty able!

643
01:03:07,436 --> 01:03:09,815
And I promised that poor little thing...

644
01:03:09,815 --> 01:03:11,751
I'd provide it all!

645
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,520
Then worry no more, Mrs Cramp.

646
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:21,720
The Lord will provide.

647
01:03:55,157 --> 01:03:58,538
Jeff...get me some of my medicine.

648
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:03,373
Got to get my heart 
started again.

649
01:04:26,832 --> 01:04:30,790
Tilly Mae...I do declare 
you're the prettiest girl at the party.

650
01:04:35,152 --> 01:04:38,802
Lorelle...you're the prettiest girl 
at the party.

651
01:04:47,581 --> 01:04:52,250
Good evening gentlemen...
Nice fresh strawberries, right here.

652
01:04:52,913 --> 01:04:55,482
Nice and fresh this morning.

653
01:04:55,482 --> 01:04:57,980
Delicious...right off the mouth.

654
01:05:29,652 --> 01:05:30,934
Upon my honour, ladies...

655
01:05:30,934 --> 01:05:34,988
These eyes of mine have never feasted 
on more unrivalled beauty.

656
01:05:37,387 --> 01:05:38,952
But it is election eve...

657
01:05:38,952 --> 01:05:42,710
...and I shall desist from 
further eulogies of the fair sex...

658
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:45,159
...lest you deem me insincere.

659
01:05:54,837 --> 01:05:55,758
Lemonade!

660
01:05:55,758 --> 01:05:57,207
I'm not in politics...

661
01:05:57,207 --> 01:06:00,385
...but must drink a bucket 
of lemonade.

662
01:06:00,385 --> 01:06:02,919
Hermann...I dread it 
as much as you do.

663
01:06:02,919 --> 01:06:05,141
Judge...you-all must be losin' your mind...

664
01:06:05,141 --> 01:06:07,827
...if you think them temperance women 
are gonna vote for US.

665
01:06:07,827 --> 01:06:10,353
After all them barrels of liquor 
we've drunk.

666
01:06:11,028 --> 01:06:17,154
Don't you know there are 200 temperance women 
in this county, who control 200 votes!?

667
01:06:18,213 --> 01:06:20,757
Why does a woman work for temperance?

668
01:06:21,355 --> 01:06:25,633
Because she's tired of liftin' 
that besotted mate of hers

669
01:06:25,633 --> 01:06:27,942
off the floor every Saturday night...

670
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:30,967
And puttin' him on the sofa, 
so he won't catch cold.

671
01:06:30,967 --> 01:06:32,845
Lemonade!

672
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:38,133
Tonight we're for temperance.

673
01:06:38,133 --> 01:06:39,715
For the cause!

674
01:06:39,715 --> 01:06:41,935
Have yourself the little cloves.

675
01:06:41,935 --> 01:06:44,951
And chew them...
chew them hard!

676
01:06:46,443 --> 01:06:51,105
We're going to that festival tonight, 
smelling like a hot mince pie.

677
01:06:57,234 --> 01:06:59,469
Are they right, Miss Lucy Lee...

678
01:06:59,469 --> 01:07:03,412
...you not being in your party dress 
and going to that festival?

679
01:07:03,412 --> 01:07:06,243
I say it ain't right!

680
01:07:06,243 --> 01:07:08,150
Dagblast it!...I asked her to go.

681
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:11,129
There should be a young man...

682
01:07:11,129 --> 01:07:12,945
<i>...ein schöne Junge!</i>

683
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:15,985
Carrying 'blumen'...
a bouquet of roses!

684
01:07:15,985 --> 01:07:18,842
There should be cold Rheinwein!

685
01:07:18,842 --> 01:07:20,494
And Strauss waltzes...

686
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:25,516
And on the long way home...
kisses in the shadow of an archway!

687
01:07:25,516 --> 01:07:27,567
Like the Cinderserella!

688
01:07:30,018 --> 01:07:32,713
Daddy Lake asked me to go, but...

689
01:07:32,713 --> 01:07:33,991
Really Uncle Billy...I...

690
01:07:34,857 --> 01:07:36,303
I just don't feel like it.

691
01:07:36,303 --> 01:07:38,007
Will you excuse me?

692
01:07:39,206 --> 01:07:40,318
Giddup!

693
01:07:46,725 --> 01:07:50,724
Judge!...Someone can make that boy a man,
with all his wildness.

694
01:07:50,724 --> 01:07:53,097
Do I hear a motion to that effect?

695
01:07:53,097 --> 01:07:54,189
I so move!

696
01:07:54,189 --> 01:07:55,680
Second the motion!

697
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,814
It's been made and seconded...
All in favour, say "aye".

698
01:07:59,843 --> 01:08:00,756
Answer is...

699
01:08:03,126 --> 01:08:04,391
...the motion's carried.

700
01:09:42,624 --> 01:09:44,010
Here you are!

701
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:46,881
Drinking your lemonade!

702
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:48,067
Politicians!

703
01:09:48,067 --> 01:09:50,048
I'm not in politics.

704
01:09:50,048 --> 01:09:53,190
But you, the "Circus" Judge!

705
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:54,584
The County Physician!

706
01:09:54,584 --> 01:09:56,124
The Sheriff!

707
01:09:56,124 --> 01:09:58,077
The Mr Dogcatcher...

708
01:09:58,077 --> 01:10:00,901
Why don't you go in 
and see the ladies?...

709
01:10:00,901 --> 01:10:02,882
Kissing their hands...

710
01:10:03,898 --> 01:10:05,085
Paying compliments...

711
01:10:05,085 --> 01:10:06,565
And getting their votes!

712
01:10:06,565 --> 01:10:08,224
Women don't vote!

713
01:10:09,149 --> 01:10:10,701
And the cadets are too young.

714
01:10:11,898 --> 01:10:12,952
Besides...

715
01:10:13,911 --> 01:10:15,932
My feet hurt.

716
01:10:15,932 --> 01:10:18,714
Running for judge,
and his feet hurts!

717
01:10:19,514 --> 01:10:24,208
What's worrying me, is where is 
that young rascal with Lucy Lee?

718
01:10:25,024 --> 01:10:26,948
If you'd have let me whamp him 
with this sword...

719
01:10:26,948 --> 01:10:30,102
He's be here by now, 
or I'd have both of his ears cut off.

720
01:10:31,056 --> 01:10:32,978
I go back to my lemonade...

721
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:36,560
That lemonade comes only 
out of my ears yet!

722
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:05,353
Well...Lucy Lee...

723
01:11:05,353 --> 01:11:08,339
I declare...
You're the prettiest girl at the party!

724
01:11:09,758 --> 01:11:11,107
Thank you Mrs Ratchitt.

725
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:23,116
Gentlemen...

726
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:26,807
Miss Lucy Lee...and Ashley Corwin...

727
01:11:26,807 --> 01:11:30,005
It's a beautiful sight...
Come, come quick!

728
01:11:47,787 --> 01:11:50,749
Comrades...on this auspicious occasion...

729
01:11:51,855 --> 01:11:53,431
I propose a toast!

730
01:11:57,575 --> 01:11:59,787
A toast to the anti-liquor...

731
01:12:03,470 --> 01:12:04,995
Brother Finney!

732
01:12:04,995 --> 01:12:07,642
Comrade Finney!

733
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:13,005
What's in the jug?

734
01:12:13,005 --> 01:12:14,897
Refreshment!

735
01:12:48,516 --> 01:12:51,767
I want to thank you for coming by...
and asking me...

736
01:12:53,695 --> 01:12:55,915
And for that other kindness.

737
01:12:57,277 --> 01:12:58,314
You're a...

738
01:13:00,205 --> 01:13:01,567
...a brave girl.

739
01:13:02,607 --> 01:13:04,071
You're the brave one...

740
01:13:05,149 --> 01:13:06,888
...for what you did last night.

741
01:13:09,108 --> 01:13:10,758
And you guessed it.

742
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:17,207
I went in there 
and showed my face...

743
01:13:17,207 --> 01:13:20,332
...and danced, and pretended 
I was having a good time...

744
01:13:22,516 --> 01:13:24,045
Thank you, Ashby.

745
01:13:29,983 --> 01:13:32,674
Daddy...please take me home.

746
01:13:42,567 --> 01:13:44,181
I've a mind to horsewhip you, boy!

747
01:14:00,115 --> 01:14:01,107
Buck Ramsey...

748
01:14:01,107 --> 01:14:03,682
When the girl came to, 
she identified him.

749
01:14:06,434 --> 01:14:09,659
I told you so!

750
01:14:09,659 --> 01:14:13,013
Them dad-blasted fool bloodhounds!

751
01:14:37,629 --> 01:14:39,100
Watch out, sheriff!

752
01:14:39,424 --> 01:14:40,150
Burn him!

753
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:52,857
Mindy!

754
01:15:16,579 --> 01:15:17,525
After him boys.

755
01:15:21,852 --> 01:15:23,365
Boss Ashby...go get him!

756
01:16:07,503 --> 01:16:11,063
<i>Ah! Das ist das schönst...das arme, arme Mädchen!</i>

757
01:16:21,603 --> 01:16:23,024
Good shootin', comrade.

758
01:16:24,241 --> 01:16:25,883
Saves the trial.

759
01:17:11,303 --> 01:17:14,926
It's a great and glorious day 
for Kentucky!

760
01:17:14,926 --> 01:17:16,347
Where no longer...

761
01:17:16,347 --> 01:17:19,327
No longer can an empty sleeve...

762
01:17:19,327 --> 01:17:21,112
...or a gimpy knee...

763
01:17:21,112 --> 01:17:25,043
...serve as a blanket 
to smother the progress...

764
01:17:25,043 --> 01:17:26,744
...of the 20th century.

765
01:17:31,074 --> 01:17:32,231
And when no longer...

766
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:34,702
...no longer my...

767
01:17:56,066 --> 01:17:57,721
My worthy opponent!

768
01:18:30,619 --> 01:18:32,026
Who can it be?

769
01:18:32,026 --> 01:18:35,083
If anybody was dead, 
I'd be the first to know it.

770
01:18:57,741 --> 01:19:02,123
No decent woman will ever speak 
to Billy Priest, from now on!

771
01:19:02,123 --> 01:19:05,091
No, I don't suppose they will.

772
01:23:17,732 --> 01:23:21,793
Man...the judge sure ain't gonna get elected, now!

773
01:24:16,031 --> 01:24:18,268
Detail...halt!

774
01:24:19,568 --> 01:24:22,841
The first three ranks will fall out 
and act as pallbearers.

775
01:26:17,527 --> 01:26:19,678
Our sister who lies here...

776
01:26:19,678 --> 01:26:22,776
...in her last breath...

777
01:26:22,776 --> 01:26:26,622
...asked that a sermon be preached
at her funeral.

778
01:26:33,141 --> 01:26:33,141
Upon me, who has never attempted 
such an undertaking...

779
01:26:33,141 --> 01:26:38,609
...devolves the privilege 
of speaking a few words...

780
01:26:38,609 --> 01:26:39,945
..above her.

781
01:26:42,969 --> 01:26:45,849
I thought of certain words 
from the Gospel...

782
01:26:45,849 --> 01:26:49,204
...of Saint Mark...for my text...

783
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:50,695
Wherein he says...

784
01:26:50,695 --> 01:26:54,541
The Lord and master 
took a child in his arms...

785
01:26:56,171 --> 01:27:03,455
...and he said 
"Whosoever receives a child in my name..."

786
01:27:03,455 --> 01:27:05,359
"...receiveth me."

787
01:27:08,234 --> 01:27:10,124
What I would rather read you...

788
01:27:10,124 --> 01:27:15,347
A story from the Gospel of St John...

789
01:27:15,347 --> 01:27:18,563
...the best beloved of Christ's disciples.

790
01:27:18,563 --> 01:27:21,039
You'll remember the occasion.

791
01:27:21,039 --> 01:27:25,699
The Lord had visited the Mount of Olives...

792
01:27:25,699 --> 01:27:29,258
...to pray, and then he had returned
to the temple.

793
01:27:32,051 --> 01:27:35,480
<i>And the scribes and Pharisees 
brought unto him...</i>

794
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:37,855
<i>...a woman taken in sin.</i>

795
01:27:37,855 --> 01:27:41,260
<i>And when they had set her in the midst...</i>

796
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:43,163
<i>...they say unto Him...</i>

797
01:27:44,594 --> 01:27:48,399
<i>"Master...this woman was taken in sin."</i>

798
01:27:50,492 --> 01:27:54,712
<i>"Now Moses commanded us in the law, 
that such should be stoned."</i>

799
01:27:54,712 --> 01:27:57,756
<i>"But what sayest thou?"</i>

800
01:28:02,613 --> 01:28:04,704
And Jesus didn't say anything.

801
01:28:06,338 --> 01:28:11,113
He simply stooped down and wrote 
with his finger on the ground...

802
01:28:11,113 --> 01:28:12,705
...as if he hadn't heard.

803
01:28:12,705 --> 01:28:15,308
But they kept after him.

804
01:28:16,271 --> 01:28:17,795
They tried to trap him.

805
01:28:19,230 --> 01:28:23,817
And finally, he raised himself up...

806
01:28:23,817 --> 01:28:25,878
And he looked them in the eye.

807
01:28:26,899 --> 01:28:28,793
And this is what he said...

808
01:28:50,361 --> 01:28:53,631
Sir...I believe you have 
my rightful place.

809
01:29:06,472 --> 01:29:09,150
You remember Jesus raised himself up.

810
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:12,892
And he looked those accusers 
in the eye...

811
01:29:12,892 --> 01:29:14,839
And this is what he said.

812
01:29:17,049 --> 01:29:19,911
"He that is without sin among you..."

813
01:29:19,911 --> 01:29:23,637
"...let him first cast the stone at her."

814
01:29:25,352 --> 01:29:27,039
Then again he stooped down...

815
01:29:27,902 --> 01:29:29,756
...and wrote upon the ground.

816
01:29:33,613 --> 01:29:36,436
And bye and bye, 
he raised himself up...

817
01:29:39,251 --> 01:29:41,041
And they were ALL gone.

818
01:29:42,798 --> 01:29:47,406
Every last one of them common scoundrels 
were gone!

819
01:29:48,538 --> 01:29:51,372
And only the woman herself, stood there.

820
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:53,804
And he said to her...

821
01:29:53,804 --> 01:30:00,225
"Woman, where are those...
thine accusers?" 

822
01:30:02,729 --> 01:30:04,691
"Hath no man condemned thee?"

823
01:30:06,158 --> 01:30:10,508
And she said...
"No man, Lord."

824
01:30:13,597 --> 01:30:15,010
And he said unto her...

825
01:30:16,068 --> 01:30:19,625
"Neither do I condemn thee."

826
01:30:31,515 --> 01:30:32,585
Brother Ashby Corwin...

827
01:30:32,585 --> 01:30:36,311
Do you think you can say a prayer?

828
01:30:49,163 --> 01:30:50,317
Yes sir.

829
01:30:51,835 --> 01:30:53,131
I think I remember one.

830
01:31:05,412 --> 01:31:09,617
Gentle Jesus, meek and mild...

831
01:31:11,173 --> 01:31:12,529
Look upon a little child.

832
01:31:14,075 --> 01:31:17,813
Pity her simplicity...

833
01:31:20,381 --> 01:31:22,365
Suffer her to come to Thee.

834
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:28,144
Amen.

835
01:32:09,828 --> 01:32:13,963
Judge Priest...
My sympathies, sir.

836
01:32:13,963 --> 01:32:16,384
You're a gallant foe.

837
01:32:19,888 --> 01:32:21,338
Mighty fine band music.

838
01:32:22,099 --> 01:32:23,497
Good marching music!

839
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:30,938
The Honourable William Pittman Priest...

840
01:32:30,938 --> 01:32:33,933
1,638 votes.

841
01:32:33,933 --> 01:32:37,149
The Honourable Horace K. Maydew...

842
01:32:37,149 --> 01:32:39,297
1,700 votes.

843
01:32:53,172 --> 01:32:55,362
It would be a gracious act indeed...

844
01:32:55,362 --> 01:32:57,980
...for Your Honour to concede the election 
at this point.

845
01:32:57,980 --> 01:33:02,692
I don't concede anything...
just yet...Horace.

846
01:33:02,692 --> 01:33:06,794
I trust Your Honour recalls 
I conceded the last election?

847
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:12,633
And I trust you'll have to repeat 
your gracious act again.

848
01:33:13,727 --> 01:33:15,650
The election ain't over yet, Maydew.

849
01:33:15,650 --> 01:33:17,903
The Tornado boys ain't voted yet.

850
01:33:17,903 --> 01:33:20,194
Not by a jugful, it ain't!

851
01:33:21,417 --> 01:33:24,495
You mean the lynching boys 
from the Tornado District?

852
01:33:34,965 --> 01:33:37,493
Them Tornado boys are comin' into town!

853
01:33:57,128 --> 01:33:58,350
Good evening, Mr Ramseur.

854
01:33:58,350 --> 01:34:00,015
Evenin' Mr Maydew.

855
01:34:06,354 --> 01:34:07,640
Evenin', Billy Priest.

856
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:09,743
Evenin', Rufe.

857
01:34:23,197 --> 01:34:25,019
Do you concede now, Judge Priest?

858
01:34:25,019 --> 01:34:28,227
I ain't conceding nothing, Horace.

859
01:34:28,227 --> 01:34:31,798
Well, then perhaps you'd like 
to make a sporting proposition of it?

860
01:34:31,798 --> 01:34:34,849
Yes...I'll make a little bet with you.

861
01:34:34,849 --> 01:34:37,032
The sum of 50 cents...

862
01:34:37,032 --> 01:34:38,723
The sum of $100!

863
01:34:39,525 --> 01:34:41,983
Oh, no, no...
I haven't got a hole in my head!

864
01:34:42,761 --> 01:34:45,047
I have lived through a revolution 
in Europe...

865
01:34:45,047 --> 01:34:47,613
A heart's  breaking war in America...

866
01:34:47,613 --> 01:34:52,105
And I know a cunning and unscrupulous politician 
when I see one.

867
01:34:52,955 --> 01:34:53,853
Thank you, Hermann.

868
01:34:53,853 --> 01:34:57,587
Professional compliments 
are always pleasing.

869
01:34:57,587 --> 01:34:59,651
I'd like to take 50...I bet Billy!

870
01:35:02,817 --> 01:35:03,642
Judge...

871
01:35:03,642 --> 01:35:05,117
I done exactly what you told me...

872
01:35:05,117 --> 01:35:07,259
I put them ladies on the steam-packet...

873
01:35:07,259 --> 01:35:09,077
The general paid for fares...

874
01:35:09,077 --> 01:35:10,118
And they're gone now.

875
01:35:21,503 --> 01:35:25,154
The lady Mrs Cramp told me to tell you
she never will forget.

876
01:35:25,154 --> 01:35:27,755
That the Lord will provide.

877
01:35:27,755 --> 01:35:30,919
Yes...

878
01:35:30,919 --> 01:35:33,812
Judge...you ain't voted for us yet.

879
01:35:33,812 --> 01:35:36,173
Ain't got but about 3 more minutes!

880
01:35:36,173 --> 01:35:38,635
Bless my sould, Jeff, 
I nearly forgot!

881
01:35:42,508 --> 01:35:48,120
The Tornado District returns 62 votes 
for Judge William Pittman Priest.

882
01:35:50,961 --> 01:35:54,683
It is now tied at 1,700 to 1,700.

883
01:36:00,191 --> 01:36:04,657
Horace, if you will permit me 
to drop my innate modesty...

884
01:36:16,657 --> 01:36:20,045
Boys...the band will now play "Dixie"!

885
01:39:13,494 --> 01:39:22,815
<i>Oh the sun shines bright 
in my old Kentucky home...</i>

886
01:39:22,815 --> 01:39:29,690
<i>'Tis summer, the children are gay...</i>

887
01:39:29,690 --> 01:39:41,735
<i>The corn-top's ripe and the meadow's in the bloom,</i>

888
01:39:41,735 --> 01:39:56,711
<i>While the birds make music all the day.</i>

889
01:40:02,057 --> 01:40:04,288
Jeff...I gotta take my medicine.

890
01:40:05,954 --> 01:40:07,784
I gotta get my heart started.

891
01:40:16,591 --> 01:40:29,082
We will sing one song 
for my old Kentucky home...

892
01:40:30,455 --> 01:40:47,712
For my Old Kentucky Home far away.

893
01:41:01,368 --> 01:41:05,485
