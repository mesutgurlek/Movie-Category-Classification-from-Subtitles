1
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,833
Colt 45, single shot.

2
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,997
You had to cock it every time you shot.

3
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,830
It was called a peacemaker, but I haven't
seen much peace that it brought.

4
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,670
No, you guys today
have that full automatic.

5
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,030
Pull the trigger and spray.

6
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,752
History's a funny thing.

7
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,078
They said Columbus discovered America
and the Indians were already here.

8
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,875
That's like me telling you
that I discovered your car.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,949
They call them evil red savages because
they didn't give up the car soon enough.

10
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,150
One thing about time.

11
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,512
No matter how much or how little passes,
it changes things.

12
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,596
People forget their past.

13
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,349
They forget the truth.
But pictures don't lie.

14
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,318
Forgotten gunslingers like Nat Love,

15
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,159
Ison Dart, Cherokee Bill.

16
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,751
And troops too,
like the Ninth and the Tenth.

17
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,715
See, people forget that almost one
out of every three cowboys was black.

18
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,356
Cos when the slaves were freed,
a lot of them headed out west.

19
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,232
Built their own towns.

20
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,999
Shit. They didn't have much choice.

21
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,069
In fact, over half the original settlers
of Los Angeles were black.

22
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,556
But for some reason,
we never hear their stories.

23
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,912
Stories like Jessie Lee and his posse.

24
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,873
That was the gambler, Father Time.

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,594
This here was crazy Little J.

26
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,115
The big man was Obobo.

27
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,310
He was Jessie's enforcer.

28
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,352
And then there was Weezie and Angel.

29
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,631
And then of course there was the leader.

30
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,478
Jessie Lee.

31
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,515
Yeah, man,
these cats was the original posse.

32
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,998
I'm gonna tell you...

33
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,556
It all started in the Spanish-American war,
on the front line.

34
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,035
(gunfire and shouting)

35
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,875
- Can it get worse?
- It's going to get worse.

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,275
I can't take too much more!

37
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,234
Jessie, we're almost out of ammunition.
Jessie!

38
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,071
Goddammit, let me go!

39
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,239
Get them off of me, Jessie Lee!
They got a fucking Gatling gun out there!

40
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,954
- Obobo, stay calm.
- Retreat!

41
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,753
Look at me. I want you to stay calm.

42
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,348
I'm calm. All right.
All right. I'm calm.

43
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,551
Is that Jessie? Let him through, boys.

44
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,676
Jessie. Still alive.

45
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,157
I would expect nothing less.
I set my clock to you. Come in.

46
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,068
Jessie, they say you can tell
a lot about a man by his profile.

47
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,318
A certain strength of character,
or lack thereof.

48
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,830
Now, yours, it's scarred, isn't it?

49
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,520
It's very, very scarred.

50
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,031
No doubt you heard the call for retreat.
Awful word, isn't it? Terrible.

51
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,234
Don't you think a good soldier would
rather die than run? I know I would.

52
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,079
Yet now you come to me
with the bullets flying

53
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,078
and you want to know
where and how to run.

54
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,718
And the real question is
if I'm gonna let the Tenth Cavalry retreat

55
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,593
or if I'm gonna let them stay right here.

56
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,789
(man shouts)

57
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,514
- Weezie!
- Yes, Colonel Graham, sir.

58
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,631
- Go and get me that man.
- What man?

59
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,320
- From the stockade...
- Durning and Walker?

60
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,874
Jessie, you volunteer to stay behind.

61
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,957
(laughs)
I'm gonna have to raise you, Durning.

62
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,476
Raise me?

63
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,830
I reckon you got some good cards.

64
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,238
Or... you're bluffing.

65
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,713
I got the cards. I got the cards.

66
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,996
I'll call you anyway.

67
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,236
I got a full house. What you got?

68
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,512
- You damn snaggle-tooth!
- Damn shame we ain't playing for money.

69
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,914
Private Durning, sir?

70
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,952
Weezie, your nose is brown enough.
What do you want?

71
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,677
Oh, it's my pleasure to tell you the colonel
wants you and Walker to come with me.

72
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,713
How you like them apples?
Come on, let's see them feet.

73
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,119
All right, now. If the colonel says we
should get going, we'll be hoppin' along.

74
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,319
Thank you, Weezie.

75
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,797
Rewards and retributions.
Rewards and retributions.

76
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,036
Mr Walker!

77
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,151
Judging by your recent desertion,

78
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,238
would you say you no longer desire
to serve in this army?

79
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,839
Yes, sir.

80
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,316
Walker, you are discharged.

81
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,228
Go on. See you. Godspeed. Run!

82
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,670
Thank you. Turn profile, please.

83
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,075
Turn profile and hold it right there.

84
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,475
Thank you. Shoot him.

85
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,229
Come on, Jessie. Man's a coward,
says killing's against God.

86
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,989
You realise I'm giving you a chance
to shoot a white man?

87
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,076
Do it.

88
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,754
Do it. Do it or the Tenth stays right here.

89
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,351
Do it!

90
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,874
Rewards and retributions.

91
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,117
And Private Durning.

92
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,435
Durning, you're a gambling man.

93
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,155
Take your chances at 30 paces
or take command of the Tenth.

94
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,397
Jessie no longer desires the position.

95
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,558
I guess I'll take command of the Tenth, sir.

96
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,836
Smarter than he looks.

97
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,239
Durning, you and your soldier report
to my office at 2100 hours. Thank you.

98
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,075
- Retreat!
- We're pulling out!

99
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,630
Thank you, Weezie.

100
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,111
Jessie, did you know this man is the last
surviving member of the Motisa tribe?

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,390
Yes, the Motisa tribe. I'll show you.

102
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,793
- Mo tea, sir?
- I didn't hear you.

103
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,360
Mo tea, sir?

104
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,512
No, thank you. You boys come with me.

105
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,916
Jessie, you disappoint me.
You've never let me down before.

106
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,632
They had a Gatling gun.

107
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,116
- We were outnumbered, outmanned...
- And out of excuses.

108
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,912
What's on your mind?

109
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,918
There's a Spanish
supply convoy tomorrow.

110
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,600
For delicate reasons
we cannot attack it openly.

111
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,508
Due to my political aspirations,
a scandal would be unwise.

112
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,191
I'd like the Tenth to slip behind
enemy lines, eliminate the enemy,

113
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,235
take those supplies, and bring whatever
you find - guns, ammunition - back to me.

114
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,591
Behind enemy lines?
Why don't you use your golden boys?

115
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,234
This mission isn't suitable for their skills.

116
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,514
- Suppose we say no, sir?
- Suppose I tell you you disappoint me?

117
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,189
Neither of you are in a position
to decline this opportunity.

118
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,949
Durning, I can throw you in the stockade
forever and then some.

119
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,152
What of your sterling career, Jessie?

120
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,317
Tried to desert in Manila.
Assaulted an officer.

121
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,874
Three escape attempts here in Cuba.

122
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,390
That's a very poor record, isn't it?

123
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:50,231
Of course, due to sentence deferment for
military service, we end up with you here.

124
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,069
You were sentenced to hang
but ended up with life in the army.

125
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,953
I can strip you of that deferment
if you wish,

126
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,753
but that leaves you
standing at the gallows.

127
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,396
Either we go on your mission
or he gets life imprisonment and I'm dead.

128
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,159
If that's how you see it, so be it.

129
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,555
Weezie.

130
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,240
Civvies? I don't understand.

131
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,559
Let's just say for this mission
uniforms would be inappropriate.

132
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,436
Dismissed.

133
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,229
Evening, Jessie.

134
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,470
(Colonel) Weezie!

135
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,639
Jessie Lee, what did you do in the States
the colonel liked you so much?

136
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,314
- What the hell is this?
- What is that?

137
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,919
Damn! Who turned out the lights?

138
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,268
Just a little humour.

139
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,358
You have to admit I'm funny, ain't I?

140
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,072
After serious evaluation of this situation,
I figured we should go by the book.

141
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,237
We will go infantry first
and sharpshooters to follow.

142
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,798
Sharpshooters all dead except Jessie.
Infantry... we it. Ain't nobody else.

143
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,276
- Sounds like you're questioning orders.
- No, sir.

144
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,072
This is horseshit.

145
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,875
Maybe we should forget about infantry.
Maybe you should just attack.

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,834
They don't even know we're here.
And they got a lot of guns.

147
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,157
- That's bad.
- It makes no sense to wake them up.

148
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,638
We'll go in there and use our hands,
our knives, and no guns. You got it, sir?

149
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,309
- Sounds like a motherfucking plan to me.
- Let's do it.

150
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,600
Yanquis! Yanquis!

151
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,550
Guns, ammo, anything you can find.

152
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,272
De oro.

153
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,239
I ain't no "de oro".

154
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,874
Lookie what we got here.
Got a case of rifles here.

155
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,592
Jessie.

156
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,994
Jessie!

157
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,076
Come here, Jessie!

158
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,511
Look, Jessie!

159
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,470
- We in trouble.
- Jesus, Jessie!

160
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,879
We found a crate of gold, you don't like it.
I'm never gonna figure you, Jessie.

161
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,592
Pack it up. We gotta go.

162
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,633
Good morning, gentlemen.
Lost our way home, have we?

163
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,514
Out of uniform and AWOL
is no way to end a career, Jessie.

164
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,279
The record will show you all died heroes.

165
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,072
(soldiers laugh)

166
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,994
What about the gold?

167
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,513
Hm. I believe the answer
to that one is "What gold?"

168
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,514
Ha!

169
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,875
(gunshot)

170
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,270
Nice shot, Jessie!

171
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,192
Come on!

172
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,275
Get 'em, Jessie!

173
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,197
Shit! Ain't nothing wrong
with getting some free booty!

174
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,311
Yahoo!

175
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,238
- (Jessie) Put the gold in the saddlebags.
- This is amazing!

176
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,989
Just what we need,
an admiration society, Jessie Lee.

177
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,476
You never know, Graham may need
his little houseboy in hell.

178
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,875
(Weezie) Hold on. I'm on your side.

179
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,514
I saved your lives.
You should be thanking me.

180
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,679
- Save the bullet. I can get us out of here.
- You'll have more company soon.

181
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,518
- Out of where?
- Here. Cuba.

182
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,393
I can get you out tomorrow.
Leave everything to me.

183
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,751
Meet the boat that takes the dead bodies
back to the States.

184
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,393
Dead bodies?

185
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,990
Yes. They take them back to the States.

186
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,112
Every fortnight -
that's two weeks - I meet the boat.

187
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,792
You meet the boat, get on the boat
and you're home. Does that sound good?

188
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,313
Now, I'll need a sizeable amount of that
gold to make sure it all runs smoothly.

189
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,274
Jessie, we got to get up outta here.

190
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,595
Maybe not so sizeable.

191
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,234
One, two, three.

192
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,030
(explosions)

193
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,313
He got greedy
but I took care of everything.

194
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,432
Only the purser knows
you're going to be on board.

195
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,109
- Where's the money?
- I changed the gold into cash.

196
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,436
I want all the money.

197
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,198
You piece-of-shit weasel.

198
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,039
Wait. You can't just go
meandering out there.

199
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,072
The only live people on this ship
is the captain and me.

200
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,715
Which means everyone else
has to go as cargo.

201
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,831
Cargo?

202
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,516
- You mean dead cargo?
- Did I fail to mention that before?

203
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,632
No, you didn't mention that,
you crazy son of a bitch.

204
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,629
We ain't got much choice. Either way,
we're going out in one of these boxes.

205
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,231
The choice is if we go out alive
or like our friend Walker here.

206
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,955
- We're gonna do it.
- Hell, no, Jessie. I'd rather swim.

207
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,232
Are you telling me that this big, strong
country ox is claustrophobic?

208
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,873
I don't like tight spaces.

209
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,753
It's nice in here, Obobo.
Real comfortable.

210
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,031
- Can we get the hell outta here?
- Obobo, look here.

211
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,358
See this here? My daddy gave me
this book when I was young.

212
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,916
- I can't read.
- No. Look in the reflection.

213
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,192
He told me if I could see my reflection
in that book, I'd be safe.

214
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,834
- It's not working.
- You keep looking.

215
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,349
In an hour from now you'll be right there.

216
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,278
- It ain't working.
- It's gonna work, Obobo.

217
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,469
(groans)

218
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,671
Seems like
all this war brings home is corpses.

219
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,915
Just let it slip through
your fingers. You try.

220
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,796
That means you're doing it wrong.

221
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,912
"Nicodemus was a slave of African birth."

222
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,838
"He was bought for a bagful of gold."

223
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,396
"He was reckoned
a part of the salt of the earth,

224
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,876
but he died years ago, very old."

225
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,753
"Nicodemus was a prophet,
at least, he was wise,

226
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,519
for he told of battles to come."

227
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,350
"How we trembled with fear
as he turned up his eyes,

228
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,232
and we heeded the shake of his thumb."

229
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,079
"...bought for a bagful of gold."
Remember that.

230
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,953
"He was reckoned
a part of the salt of the earth,

231
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,719
but he died years ago, very old."

232

at least, he was wise,

when he rolled up his eyes,

235

(? "One Night Of Freedom"
by B.B.O. T.I. (Badd Boyz of the Industry))

238
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,635
? God only knows what tomorrow brings

239
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,479
? All I need is one night of freedom

240
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,275
? Gotta let the fun take control of me

241
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,630
? Now it's time for us to come together

242
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,117
? I wish this night would last forever

243
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,309
Oh, yeah, baby!

244
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,069
I got paid. A couple of days ago the man
was gonna kill me, now he pays me.

245
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,796
Jessie Lee, this pocket change is for shit.
What about the rest of that there gold?

246
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,549
Spending will attract attention.
I'll give it to you in the morning.

247
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,150
- Hold on just one minute.
- I'll give it to you in the morning.

248
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,716
Can't I hang onto
a couple of them satchels of gold?

249
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,831
You know you can trust me.

250
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,396
I won't spend it until you give me
the word. Let me hang onto them.

251
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,875
In the morning.
Then I'm going out west.

252
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,151
- Where you going?
- I got some unfinished business.

253
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,909
Jessie, you can't do that. We're a posse.
All for one, one for all.

254
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,158
When did you last have a woman?
I know a couple with behinds like...

255
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,511
Jessie, I'm coming with you. Jessie...

256
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,870
- Obobo, listen.
- Let me come with you.

257
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,879
You deserve more than I got to offer.
Take this book. Take the book.

258
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,629
This is good luck.
I want you to hold onto it.

259
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,515
The next time I see you,
I want you to know how to read it. OK?

260
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,713
(whooping and cheering)

261

00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,552
Mm. Yeah!

263
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,633
(shouting and cheering)

264
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,716
Weezie, they're naked!

265
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,075
Oh, my God! Make me think I've been
in the wrong saddle all these years!

266
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,233
That's Abdul. Hey, Abdul! Beautiful!

267
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,193
You guys need me! This is the one I love.

268
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,709
Hello! Hey, sweetheart!

269
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,559
I told you guys you needed...

270
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,790
Weezie, you little sneaky boy!
You all right with me!

271
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,791
So these are your war hero troops,
Weezie?

272
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,799
Tell me, is he as good a commander
as he is a charmer?

273
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,317
Uh, yes, ma'am. You could say
he's a charming commander.

274
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,874
And mighty good to us too, ma'am.

275
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,198
So he tells us. Come on in
and show us that heavy artillery.

276
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,269
Don't fret. The only colour we care about
is the green of your dollars.

277
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,391
- Yes, ma'am.
- Just what you want.

278
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,311
- (woman shrieks)
- Ooh!

279
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,398
Excuse me, ma'am.
Did I hear you say green?

280
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,877
Yeah, honey. We got lots of green
upstairs. Just follow Big Kate.

281
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,149
We have a special guest tonight.
One of Colonel Graham's boys.

282
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,555
Evening. My name's Jimmy J Teeters.

283
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,470
My friends all call me Little J
on account of I was the youngest.

284
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,830
This is Dimples, Louisiana Slim,

285
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,554
Father Time and Jimmy Love.

286
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,114
Boys, this is a war hero, so take it easy.

287
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,153
Come on in. We like a man
who puts his money where his mouth is.

288
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,195
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
Let me see if I got all these names right.

289
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,709
We got Louisiana Slim,

290
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,230
Dimples, Jimmy Love and Father Time.

291
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,749
How come they call you that?

292
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,158
We could sit here for eternity and a day
and nobody gonna beat Father Time.

293
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,874
- Ain't that right?
- That's right.

294
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,516
Isn't that something? We're gonna
have to see about that, ain't we, boys?

295
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,393
Put your money out there, Little J.

296
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,989
We fought our way up the San Juan Hill
and then fought our way down.

297
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,078
Then up.
They chased us down the other side.

298
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,799
Agh! Angel! It's a man!

299
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,673
Angel, let's get outta here!

300
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,998
What you oughta do is put that milk down
and get you some of that liquor,

301
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,750
and get one of these pretty things
before you end up with that ding-a-ling.

302
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,510
I haven't had a good hand yet.

303
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,952
Your hand looked low, red man,
but I'll take the deed to your teepee.

304
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,640
Try that and I'll scalp your black ass.

305
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,435
I don't know what kinda mojo
you got working on these cards,

306
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,835
but it sure is working.

307
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,633
The game is five-card stud, Mr Teeters.

308
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,389
I'm glad you're close, so I won't
have to reach out for your money.

309
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,080
(Louisiana Slim)
Let's go. Give me some cards.

310
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,918
Deal me in, Father Time.

311
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,637
It's natural progress.
Got to happen sooner or later.

312
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,754
Cutterstown folk won't let us have no land
- even reservation land - without a fight.

313
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,235
Better to wait forever than to fight.

314
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,354
When you start killing for a dream,
you usually end up killing the dream too.

315
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,950
That's what hell is,
watching your dreams die.

316
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,798
Your education will set you free.

317
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,148
(Little J laughs)

318
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,478
Triplet queens and the one-eyed jack,
boys. Blind as justice.

319
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,556
Ain't no justice at this table.

320
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,118
Sure there is, Jimmy Love,
just to you justice ain't been served.

321
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,711
Well, well, well. Looks like
Father Time ran out of time.

322
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,674
Lady Luck sure ain't with me.
Guess it's your deal.

323
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,836
With pleasure.

324
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,233
Go on, now, Time!
Go, go, go! Look out below!

325
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,558
Out of the way! Out of the way!
Your ass is mine! I'm coming through!

326
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,756
Obobo, I hate to say it,
but your friend Jessie is very strange.

327
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,793
He's weird. He don't talk much.
I never trust a man who don't talk much.

328
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,354
- Am I right, Angel? Am I right?
- Shit!

329
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,040
Let me tell you something about that boy.

330
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,958
I seen him shoot a man, put his gun away,

331
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,039
shoot another man three times,
walk out the door before he hits the floor!

332
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,993
That doesn't make a difference.
The man is weird.

333
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,237
We came all this way together
and then he just takes off.

334
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,636
He's got something twistin' in his mind.
I don't know what.

335
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,389
He'd ride to hell and back
and gun down the devil if it'd fix it.

336
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,910
Fix it? You wanna fix something?
Fix that bad eye of yours.

337
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,076
(shouts)

338
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,031
- Hey!
- He's talking about my eye!

339
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,116
- So what?
- He's talking about my eye!

340
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,879
You tough
when it comes to shooting a man.

341
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,030
But when it comes to shooting a woman
between the legs, it's another story!

342
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,630
This here's Father Time.
If anyone asks, you ain't seen us.

343
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,709
Give me some more of that gold
and I'll tell them I ain't seen you before.

344
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,638
Angel, who's that?

345
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,992
Candyman! You're looking
sharp as a mail catalogue on foot!

346
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,829
- Shining and gleaming and everything!
- Your breath stinks.

347
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,398
If your wife took more time to douche,
I might not have that problem.

348
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,876
Little J, Jessie left this for you.

349
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,036
Thank you, Obobo.

350
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,151
- Father Time?
- What's up?

351
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,956
You're pretty damn good with them cards.
Getting caught back there was stupid.

352
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,514
- Hazard of the occupation.
- Hazard?

353
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,835
A hazard you're lucky to live through.

354
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,918
Let me tell you a story.
I had a partner once named Silas.

355
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,474
Black man, like you. Could he cook!

356
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,318
- You cook?
- (grunts)

357
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,398
Me and Silas used to run a card game
back in Abilene

358
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,671
till one time old Silas got caught cheating.

359
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,349
Let me tell you,
they peeled his black ass like a grape.

360
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,916
Me, I figured the army
was a good way to let things cool off.

361
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,316
Spare my black ass the nostalgia, soldier.

362
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,193
That why you helped me?
You getting misty-eyed?

363
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,673
Oh, no, no, no.

364
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,839
As far as partners go,
I ain't so sure you'd make a good one.

365
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,397
I figure any man with your skill, getting
caught back there like that by fools,

366
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,829
he might need
some more schooling himself.

367
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,157
No, I got in it back there just for the fun.

368
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,716
See, I ain't much on people, Time.

369
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,912
Money's great. Booze is all right.

370
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,715
But for me, most of all, it's the thrill.

371
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,231
You know that thrill of knowing
you could win it all or lose it all

372
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,510
in the blink of an eye?

373
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,757
You sure is the kind
that would fart in the bathtub

374
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,440
and turn round and bite the bubble.

375
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,994
Maybe after you teach me a thing or two

376
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,908
we can try it again in, say, Texas.

377
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,600
See there? You're learning already.

378
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,280
I'd like to propose a toast.

379
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,716
(talking in next room)

380
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,959
To Texas.

381
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,356
(Angel) We're having so much fun!

382
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,632
Candyman, check it out. Little J.
I had this one little girl...

383
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,911
- Who in the fuck is you?
- I got no problem with you.

384
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,555
If you ain't got no troubles,
why don't you and that tired-ass Sioux

385
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,798
- get your troublesome ass out of here?
- Don't make me change my mind.

386
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,277
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.

387
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,753
Piece of shit!
Take all of us to hell, then.

388
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,315
Weezie, you disappoint me.

389
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,757
Brigade!

390
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,199
- Weezie!
- Fire!

391
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,515
I can't dodge the bullets!
We've got to jump, Weezie.

392
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,598
You jump first. You're the longest.

393
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,918
Come on, Weezie! Jump!

394
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,509
Colonel Graham, sir? These men
took me hostage. It was awful, sir.

395
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,198
- Come on, Weezie!
- Shit!

396
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,240
(yells)

397
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,557
- Come on, Weezie! Come on!
- Where are you?

398
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,993
Go! Go! Go! Go!

399
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,633
Go!

400
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,233
- We gotta catch up the others. Hold on!
- (Weezie) I'm holding!

401
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,556
Obobo! Weezie!

402
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,917
- Reckon they give up?
- They ain't ever gonna give up.

403
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,952
- Look here, Little J.
- Damn!

404
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,874
- What are we gonna do, Little J?
- Hell if I know.

405
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,991
We'd best warn Jessie. Let's go.

406
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,636
(Weezie) I got to get me a fresh horse.

407
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,228
(Weezie) This makes no sense to me.
How long have we been going now?

408
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,909
None of this stuff was in
any of the books or magazines I read.

409
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,238
I'm riding like two grizzly bears
trying to fuck a racoon. My ass hurts.

410
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,476
Shut up before I really make it hurt.

411
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,875
Shit, ain't no percentage in this.

412
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,672
(gunshot)

413
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,031
(Obobo) Jessie?

414
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,118
It's gotta be. Jessie? That you?

415
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,355
- We got trouble.
- Jessie.

416
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,516
They killed Angel.

417
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,391
(Little J whoops)

418
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,877
Ain't this pretty, boys?
I tell you, I still cannot believe that shot

419
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,358
that Jessie knocked the colonel's
Motisa brain out of his eye socket with.

420
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,677
Can't wait to see his next portrait.
Right, Obobo?

421
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,155
- You said it.
- (Weezie) It's like I always said.

422
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:53,796
Nothing bonds men closer together
than having a common enemy.

423
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,674
With Colonel Graham and his brigade
on our asses and after that gold,

424
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,236
we are bonded together for life,
if you get my meaning.

425
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,237
How long is this life for?

426
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,194
These Spanish gold coins
are mighty pretty. Mighty rare too.

427
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,676
But if you spend them,
you'll leave a trail for that colonel.

428
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,713
- You trying to say I'm poor and I'm dead?
- Shit, yeah.

429
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,434
After I've finished my business out west,

430
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,599
I'm gonna go up to Canada and the
Dakota territories and let things cool off.

431
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,154
Y'all wanna ride with me, that's OK.

432
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,512
Don't ask no questions that need
answering. And don't get in my way.

433
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,428
- (Obobo) I'm with you, Jessie.
- (Weezie) I'm definitely with you.

434
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,915
(Little J) I've come this far, what the hell.

435
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:40,512
What about you, Mr Well-Dressed?
Why you wanna ride with outlaws?

436
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,839
I got a good feeling about you boys
and I always plays my hunches.

437
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,554
Everything's got its price.

438
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,638
Hell, a man's gotta give the devil his due.

439
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,795
I'm telling you, that stack of yours
works better with a partner.

440
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,993
Spreads the take around,
makes it less noticeable. It's perfect.

441
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,635
- How come you're with these boys?
- That's a long story.

442
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,593
You got time to tell me
why you take his orders?

443
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,678
Or why you wanna throw in with me?

444
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,037
Seems to me the only problem
the white man has with the coloured man

445
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,878
is that he's afraid.

446
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,992
You know how people are always afraid
of what they don't know

447
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,680
or what they don't understand?

448
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,760
Me, I ain't afraid of much.

449
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,870
Except boredom.

450
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,949
Believe you me, riding with Jessie Lee,
you ain't never gonna be bored.

451
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,719
Most people would notice
if we were partners.

452
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:02,551
No. It's the friend and the stranger scam.
I'm telling you, it is perfect.

453
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,595
(rustling)

454
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,911
Man can't find rest in his sleep.

455
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,558
Damn!

456
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,036
(animal growls)

457
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,395
Mama, who are those men?
They got guns.

458
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,238
Oh, my!

459
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,429
Hell we doing here?

460
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:52,315
I think I've found a way
to make this gold a little less hot.

461
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,508
Lookie here.

462
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,916
Melt 'em down into 20-ounce bars.
No questions asked.

463
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,713
Do a good job and I'll give you one.

464
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,675
My little friend here's gonna stick around,
make sure you do it right.

465
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:24,559
And there's just one more little
special thing I need you to do for me.

466
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,716
What's that?

467
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,757
- You done, smithy?
- As soon as this batch cools.

468
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,877
You make that special order he asked for?

469
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,757
I had to plate the cartridge,
but that slug's pure.

470
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,000
It's gonna make a nasty hole
in something, gold being so soft.

471
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,588
- I can't figure out...
- Just pack it up.

472
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,037
Come on, now, Obobo, give me a hand.

473
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,037
Father Time.

474
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,639
Sometimes it's important
to be able to trust a man, isn't it?

475
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,399
- I was just looking at this...
- No.

476
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,875
Not you. Him.

477
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,394
What's the odds we can trust him?

478
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,788
- Not good, I guess.
- No.

479
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,878
- You always play your hunches, right?
- Mm-hm.

480
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,709
(Little J and Obobo laughing)

481
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,637
- Go ahead and shoot him.
- Huh?

482
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,115
Go ahead and shoot him.

483
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,870
You're joking, right?

484
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,116
Call me out, huh?

485
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,471
OK.

486
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,316
Mister, I don't know you.

487
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,230
But when I get through with you,
won't nobody know you.

488
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:11,194
Wait a minute, mister.
I didn't do nothing to you.

489
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,869
- It's you!
- You shouldn't give a rat's ass who he is.

490
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,638
I'm gonna kill you.

491
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,075
You gonna shoot, shoot.

492
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,791
Save the bluffing for games.

493
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,118
- Jessie, you killed the blacksmith.
- We gotta get out of here.

494
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,912
Let's go!

495
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,555
I want you to take this little package
over to a man named...

496
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,877
When he shows up, give it to him.
It's real important. OK?

497
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,672
OK.

498
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,360
What the shit is going on?

499
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,511
Take off your hat when you talk to a lady.

500
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,759
- Crazy son of a bitch.
- (Little J) Watch that, now, Time.

501
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,676
See that bad man right there?
That's Father Time.

502
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,950
We the outlaw posse.

503
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,277
You run down there and tell the sheriff

504
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,597
that Father Time and the outlaw posse's
in a killing mood.

505
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,188
- Move.
- Jessie, what are you doing?

506
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,519
I said everything's got its price.

507
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,235
Now so will you. Just like the rest of us.

508
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,955
(Little J) You always play your hunches.
Ain't that right?

509
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,714
Hey, boy!

510
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,156
Hey, boy!

511
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,233
Afternoon, Watt.

512
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,551
Hey, Jessie,
you wouldn't shoot a lawman, would you?

513
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,233
Jessie, I'm unarmed. I'm unarmed.

514
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,193
Jessie, you wouldn't shoot. Please, Jessie.

515
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,349
You wouldn't shoot an unarmed...

516
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,156
(train whistle)

517
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,477
Jessie!

518
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,912
Jessie!

519
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,279
They were just here.

520
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,995
- Excuse me. Is yous Colonel Graham?
- Yes, darling, I am.

521
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:18,148
One of them left something.
Said to give it to Colonel Graham.

522
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,237
It has not been long.
We can still get them.

523
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,635
In time.

524
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:36,191
That crazy fool better know who he's
messing with. I ain't going to jail for him.

525
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,949
We all better know who
we're messing with. They're all killers.

526
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,117
The colonel likes
getting prisoners on military deferment.

527
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,196
Like Jessie. He was supposed to hang.

528
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:50,075
I don't know what demons Jessie has,
but I know he definitely has a past.

529
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,556
That's what the gold bullets are for.
Gold's timeless.

530
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,958
The hoodoo ladies in New Orleans
believe the only way to put demons to rest

531
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,513
is to kill them with gold.

532
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,108
Hold on! Y'all are talking craziness.

533
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,870
With 500 dollars on each of our heads, we
all got plenty of our own demons after us.

534
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,355
We have had pretty good luck up till now.

535
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,790
Maybe it's better if we go our own ways.
Split up.

536
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:17,789
You can split up if you want to. But if
anybody can get us there, Jessie can.

537
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,036
Dead or alive.

538
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,313
(plays haunting tune)

539
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,196
(woman) Jessie! Jessie!

540
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,793
Stop!

541
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,276
Jessie, stop it.

542
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,360
Jessie Lee, we hereby sentence you
to life in the military.

543
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,116
(? "Let That Hammer Fall"
by The Neville Brothers)

544
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,277
? Let that hammer fall

545
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,233
? But I didn't get very far

546
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,715
? Let that hammer fall

547
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,711
? I was riding out with my gang

548
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,114
? Let that hammer fall

549
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,516
? Oh, I'm lucky that it wasn't a man

550
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,995
? Let that hammer fall

551
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,469
? These railroad tracks
gonna break my back

552
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,558
? Let that hammer fall

553
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,639
? If I wipe my brow
I hear the bullwhip crack

554
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,832
? Let that hammer fall

555
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,873
? See the big white man
on his big white horse...

556
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,155
Cutterstown. Look at that.
We're still a long way off.

557
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,714
Not if we go through Diablo Pass.

558
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,400
That's Sioux territory, Jessie.

559
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,229
We won't have help from soldiers
if we get into trouble.

560
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,072
The red man ain't got no problem
with the black man.

561
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,318
As for you, white boy,
that's a whole different story.

562
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,752
First you enslave the black man,
exploit the yellow man,

563
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:18,237
then you kill the red man so you can use
his land for railroads. Can I get a witness?

564
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:18,997
Amen!

565
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:24,035
If I may approach the bench, Your Honour,
I ain't never personally enslaved nobody,

566
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,879
so, Time, you can kiss my white ass.

567
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,676
If there was a train on these tracks
right now, we'd both be on it.

568
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,874
But I'd be gambling and you'd be
fetching my chips like a little houseboy.

569
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,958
You can't even cheat right.
Can I get a witness?

570
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,433
Amen!

571
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,836
- Jessie, can I kill the cracker?
- Let the Indians get him.

572
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,359
Let's move out.

573
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,436
Come on, Jessie, let's have some fun.

574
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,677
? Ain't no man can put a chain on me

575
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,758
? Let that hammer fall

576
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,475
? Oh, sometime I think about the red man

577
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,954
? With the feathers in his hair

578
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,675
? Took me in his home

579
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,314
? And together we grow grain

580
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,318
? He was my friend

581
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,073
? That old Indian...

582
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,436
(Obobo) I told you, Weezie.
Jessie Lee will show us the way.

583
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,358
- (Weezie) When you're right, you're right.
- Don't fall in.

584
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,754
(laughter)

585
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:38,113
Hillbilly, I knows you ain't crazy.
Dilapidated motherfucker.

586
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,916
What's that old saying, Jessie?
Time sure flies when you're having fun!

587
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,395
Kiss my... Argh!

588
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,919
Give your soul to heaven
cos your ass is mine!

589
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,635
Yeah? Well, get ready, cos here it comes!

590
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,234
You're gonna need
a mouthful of gold teeth.

591
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,315
- Look at that!
- I'm taking a piss.

592
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,637
- Look at the size of your dick!
- Jessie! Jessie!

593
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,955
Look at his dick!

594
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,474
The coloured dicks are coming!

595
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,110
(Weezie) Fuck. Fuck, I say. Fuck.

596
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:47,074
Fuck this monotonous cowboy bullshit!

597
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,192
What is "monotonous"?

598
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,834
It means I can't take it no more.

599
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,748
- Shut up!
- We got company, Jessie.

600
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,079
I'm talking about revolution
without bullets.

601
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,794
Revolution without violence or bloodshed.

602
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,595
It's easier to shoot a gun
than it is to read a book.

603
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,919
It's easier to take a man's life than it is
to educate him and teach him about life.

604
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:56,033
It's easier to hate than it is to love.

605
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,720
The revolution I'm talking about

606
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,833
is a revolution of the mind and the spirit.

607
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,315
And education, that's the key.

608
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,637
Education leads to freedom.
Education is freedom.

609
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,557
Education will teach you

01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,630
So did I.

761
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,639
Maybe it was for the best.

762
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,513
Carver's asked me to marry him.

763
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,070
Do you love him?

764
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,713
You know, maybe...

765
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,593
Maybe you deserve more than...

766
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,480
than I got to give, lady.

767
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:34,595
- You don't want me to touch you, I won't.
- I don't, so don't.

768
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,634
Bye, Jessie Lee.

769
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:52,029
? Tell me that you want me again

770
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,835
? Ooh, ooh

771
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,873
Why you been staring at me
all night, big man?

772
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,913
I never heard a woman
sing pretty as a bird before, ma'am.

773
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,350
What's that in your pocket, music lover?

774
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,835
Shucks, ma'am. It's nothing but my harp.

775
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,315
Play for me. Go ahead.

776
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,879
Better yet, why don't you play on these?

777
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,831
(giggling)

778
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:27,750
Go ahead! Get! Play on it.
Get, get, get, get, get!

779
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,628
(whooping)

780
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,549
(man) Freedom!

781
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,238
I came to apologise.

782
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,432
You OK?

783
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,078
Hey.

784
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,556
Come with me.

785
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,598
You remember this when we were kids?

786
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,792
You remember this?

787
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,398
(laughs)

788
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,398
Woman, you crazy!

789
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,752
(screams)

790
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:44,469
You know what your problem is?
You think about death too much.

791
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:48,878
You need to start thinking
about what's still alive.

792
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:52,953
(laughter)

793
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:56,914
Looks like you boys are outta money.
You have to pay to see these.

794
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,952
Hold on there, Papa Joe.

795
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,674
I... am in.

796
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,392
I sure hopes you work on credit.

797
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:06,233
You know how to cheat Mr Death?

798
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:12,270
By making love. Cos every time
you make love, you can make another life.

799
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:15,039
And that makes Mr Death mad as hell.

800
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,108
(cheering)

801
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,959
Hi, honey. He's an animal, girl!

802
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,236
Evening, gentlemen.

803
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:06,670
Sorry to bother you, but certain matters
have come to my attention.

804
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:12,113
Seems that we have some undesirable
elements in our society, like him.

805
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,070
And... like him.

806
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,952
Do it.

807
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:24,158
My, my, you do stick out in this crowd.

808
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:28,114
Sheriff, you can't just come in
and drag people out of here.

809
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:34,472
I'm gonna ask you nice, just once.

810
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:39,110
- Where's Jessie Lee?
- I don't know what you talking about.

811
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,192
All right, let's see who's next.

812
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,118
Hey, boy.

813
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,196
You hear me, boy?

814
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,479
You telling me you risk a beating
to protect that outlaw?

815
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,990
He'll bring trouble
to this pretty little coloured town.

816
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,398
Don't touch my woman!

817
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,350
Where is he?

818
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,070
Weezie ain't never done nothing.

819
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:42,508
Son, you are about to learn
a very valuable lesson.

820
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,072
(groaning and screaming)

821
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,516
(bell ringing)

822
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:17,114
We got him good, huh?

823
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,875
He asked for it.

824
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:26,517
What in hell are you looking at?
You ain't seen nothing.

825
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:30,358
Get back inside!

826
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,072
You heard me!

827
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:35,749
- Bates! Bates!
- Carver, they got Papa Joe!

828
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,630
What the hell you think you're doing?
You let that man go.

829
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,273
Ain't no darky gonna give me orders. Ever!

830
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,393
Do it, Carver.

831
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,718
Do it.

832
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,558
Do it.

833
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:05,197
I'm coming back tomorrow with more
men and more guns than you ever seen.

834
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:08,118
And I want Jessie Lee right here.

835
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,390
Right here!

836
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,715
Dead or alive.

837
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:19,789
And as for those other two - Papa Joe and
that boy - don't worry about them none.

838
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:24,277
They're gonna get a fair trial.
Just like Jessie Lee.

839
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,950
- Hey, hey!
- Give me that! Eli!

840
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,593
Settle down.

841
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:34,075
Get those ladies inside!

842
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,432
Let's break it up! Break it up.

843
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,514
Move!

844
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:02,074
He tried to save me. That's the first time
anybody tried to save me.

845
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:07,194
Ain't no profit in trying to save nobody.
You only end up...

846
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,276
You only end up dead.

847
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:27,513
Jessie, don't you go and do nothing crazy.

848
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:31,553
- This here's a peaceful town.
- This here ain't peaceful.

849
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,036
Partner, nobody wanted this to happen.

850
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:40,712
It happened, and you the lawman, so you
better think about what you want to do.

851
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:41,955
Yeah.

852
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,594
(Lana) Where's Daddy? Daddy!

853
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,915
Lana. Lana.

854
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,276
Sheriff Bates done gone
and took your daddy to Cutterstown

855
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,437
for one of his so-called fair trials.

856
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,552
Jessie.

857
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:24,393
You know Papa Joe and the other man
won't get no fair trial.

858
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,557
KKK gonna be on 'em before sunrise.

859
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,834
- Let me out! Let me out!
- Pipe down.

860
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,713
You boys will get a fair trial
as God is my witness.

861
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:11,958
Is that the same God that witnessed you
putting black folks into slavery

862
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,469
and stealing Indians' land?

863
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,239
You ought to be working on
saving your black soul.

864
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,318
Shit. I'm working on saving my black ass.

865
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:24,911
You boys don't worry.
You'll get your fair trial or my name ain't...

866
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,678
- My name...
- Shut up, Tom.

867
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,678
Right. Thank you, Mayor. Tom.

868
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,318
You boys back off.

869
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,715
I can't let you vigilantes come in here

870
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,674
and take these free negroville citizens
and do what you got to do.

871
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,917
For God's sake,
stand up for yourself, Tom!

872
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,713
I'm sorry, Mayor, but they got guns.

873
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:03,076
Jessie. The real white sheets is coming.

874
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,399
Let's get outta here.

875
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:26,629
Jessie Lee was here.
He left. He took them with him.

876
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:35,510
Shit fire! You've just shot the mayor!

877
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:37,392
No, Errol.

878
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,875
Jessie Lee just shot the mayor.

879
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,471
I think the wonderful citizens of
Cutterstown will want me as the new one.

880
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,635
Who are you?

881
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,514
Won't the townspeople be surprised
by the demise of their mayor?

882
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,153
What do you want?

883
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:55,910
There's no need for animosity.
Any friend of Jessie's is a friend of mine.

884
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,278
- Jessie, are they still following us?
- Hell, yeah. It's like white on rice.

885
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:09,632
Once the sheriff gets a head of steam up,
he's like a locomotive on a track.

886
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:13,150
- What did you say?
- I said he's like a locomotive.

887
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,553
Jessie, what is it?

888
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,591
Railroad.

889
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:23,075
You son of a bitch.

890
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:31,158
Boys, this is where
we're gonna part company.

891
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:34,955
What? What are you saying? You know
what happens when we split up.

892
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:39,949
- After all we've done, we are a posse.
- Jessie, them deputies killed Little J.

893
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:45,074
Obobo, I've been fighting over
what's dead for a long time.

894
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,873
It's time I start fighting for what's alive.

895
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,753
You know, Jessie Lee,

896
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:56,432
besides the fact of you having
something against me keeping my hat on,

897
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,516
I always figured you for an OK guy.

898
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,518
I even thought at the end of this
there'd be some gold.

899
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,710
I reckon I was wrong.

900
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,116
But one thing I do know
is there ain't no profit in dying.

901
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:12,075
If you go back, you face certain death
from that sheriff or that colonel.

902
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:17,752
Whichever one it may be, these town
people won't be here when you need 'em.

903
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:21,634
(Obobo) What if he's right, Jessie?
We shouldn't split up.

904
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,237
(angry shouting)

905
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:41,274
I know you're angry.

906
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:45,234
You're ready to destroy, ain't you?
Take matters into your own hands.

907
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:49,956
That's anger talking. The only thing
anger ever did was tear things down.

908
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:54,312
- People, we done built something here.
- That's right.

909
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:57,034
Something good.
Something that's ours.

910
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:02,757
But we know Sheriff Bates. You think he's
gonna think twice about burning all this?

911
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,678
Jessie should give himself up,
turn himself in.

912
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:09,918
Cos we have been keeping the peace
and nothing like this happened before.

913
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,998
That white man, he was not one of us.

914
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:17,193
- No, but Papa Joe is.
- Papa Joe? Hey.

915
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:22,519
Can I ask y'all a question?

916
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:28,588
If Bates can ride up into this town,
beat a man to death and get away with it,

917
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:30,631
what does that mean he can do to you?

918
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:34,514
We all know what this is really about.
This is about King David.

919
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:40,670
We loved King David, but he is dead. This
is between you and Sheriff Bates, not us.

920
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,395
Jessie Lee
ain't what Bates wants no more.

921
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:47,637
What he wants is your town.

922
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:52,834
Because he knows the iron railroad
is coming through Freemanville,

923
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:59,035
and whoever owns this property
when the railroad comes is gonna be rich.

924
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,355
Right over on Diablo Plains

925
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:06,110
they pushing the red man off his land
to make way for that iron railroad.

926
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:09,915
The same thing they did to that red man,
they gonna do to you.

927
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,190
Jessie's right. I've been through it.

928
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:16,154
Why do you think Bates is fixing up
his office like that and carrying on?

929
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:19,989
He got big plans for Cutterstown.
They want this land.

930
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:24,238
And the only way y'all is gonna keep
this land is to stand up and fight.

931
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:26,874
No justice, no peace!

932
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,958
(angry shouting)

933
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:34,551
You talking about a black KK raid
on a white town?

934
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,193
That's crazy.

935
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,675
They ain't soldiers. We ain't in Cuba.

936
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:43,954
I do believe this boy done got sunstroke.
He about to start a damn war.

937
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:47,868
Even if we wanted to,
we ain't got enough guns for that.

938
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,879
- Jessie. I'm with them on this.
- All right.

939
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,437
I'm gonna leave.
Y'all think you can sit safe.

940
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,872
You think that railroad's gonna
take a nice little turn and miss this town.

941
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,230
I seen my daddy's dream come true.

942
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:06,955
I'm done.
But I'm gonna guarantee you something.

943
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:11,870
The next time I come back to this town,
ain't gonna be one black face here

944
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,788
unless he's polishing shoes
at Bates's railroad station.

945
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,912
(shouting and arguing)

946
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,159
(man) Jessie.

947
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,035
Now, boy, you know me.

948
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:54,233
You know I ain't never asked nobody
for nothing. But now we need you.

949
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:57,750
We found out the sheriff
is going to attack us tomorrow noon

950
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:00,440
and he's blaming you
for killing the mayor.

951
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:05,429
You was right and we was wrong. But we
got no time to kiss your fuzzy behind.

952
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:09,235
(Papa Joe) Once upon a time you came
and begged me to teach you how to fight.

953
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:13,319
Now you gotta teach us how to fight,
so we can defend ourselves.

954
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:18,753
After what you said, me and Papa Joe
broke into his strongbox.

955
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:23,317
Found a whole mess of blueprints.
This here's one of 'em.

956
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:27,270
That's a railroad station
in the middle of this "Bates Town".

957
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:30,517
If you ask me,
it looks a lot like Freemanville.

958
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:34,394
That goddamn Bates
gonna wipe us right off the map.

959
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:37,637
I done bought myself out of slavery.
Twice.

960
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:43,072
That's my inn down there.
I'm gonna fight.

961
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:47,432
You're talking right, Jessie.
I'm gonna fight too.

962
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,312
Jessie Lee!

963
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,832
Jessie Lee!

964
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:44,914
Jessie Lee, you should have stayed gone.

965
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:48,589
Between me and you, Bates.
Nobody needs to get hurt.

966
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,956
- Why don't you let the town be?
- Jessie Lee, Jessie Lee.

967
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,640
You ain't looking at the big picture.

968
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,718
But then, neither did your daddy.

969
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:02,029
Like father, like son.

970
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:05,311
You ain't gonna hide
behind that badge today, Sheriff.

971
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:10,637
I guarantee, Freemanville burn,
Cutterstown gonna burn too.

972
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:15,553
He's bluffing!

973
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,796
We gonna start with
that nice little office of yours.

974
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,469
Why don't you ask your hard-working man
Two Bears up there?

975
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,795
You know he don't bluff.

976
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,680
That was your office! He wasn't bluffing!

977
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:40,634
Shut up!
Jessie Lee, you're a dead man!

978
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,673
Here they comes, boys.

979
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,555
Dismount!

980
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,831
- You got it?
- Last one.

981
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,512
Can't we all get along?

982
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:56,153
Hot damn!

983
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:58,191
I'll cover.

984
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,149
(gunshot)

985
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:16,151
Go, Jessie!

986
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,591
Man the Gatling gun!

987
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,593
Move!

988
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:10,992
Deserter!

989
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:28,069
(Obobo) Jessie! Jessie!

990
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:32,429
Jessie!

991
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,276
Cover me.

992
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:45,952
Shit!

993
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:57,995
You bitch!

994
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,358
You saved my life!

995
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:23,430
Yeah, but I should have saved mine and
kept riding. Cos Lady Luck ain't with me.

996
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,835
There won't be no town when this is over.

997
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:32,714
Damn the town! It don't matter.
I still got the deeds.

998
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:36,150
Town or not, the land's worth something
when the rail comes.

999
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:40,518
- I got a wife and kids. I'm outta here.
- Hey!

1000
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,835
Look, Jessie didn't kill the mayor.

1001
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,951
Bates did. I was there.

1002
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:48,072
I'm getting outta here.

1003
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,948
- Carver?
- Lana.

1004
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:58,670
I thought about what Jessie said.

1005
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:04,432
Whoever owns this land will be rich
by selling to Bates or the railroad.

1006
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,677
All the deeds are in your name.
You insisted on that.

1007
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:11,349
Baby girl, there's a lot going on here
you don't understand.

1008
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:13,550
So I see.

1009
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:18,037
Lana, white folks in this country
got the power. We gonna lose this town.

1010
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:21,516
Why shouldn't one of us
turn a profit in the process?

1011
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:24,029
Woman, why can't you see?

1012
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:27,474
It's for us, Lana. For you and me.

1013
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:32,515
I'm sick of watching you trying to teach
them poor raggedy kids how to read.

1014
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:34,676
Listen.

1015
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,712
I know you was with Jessie last night.

1016
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:44,234
I know how this looks and I know you
confused about a whole lot of things, but...

1017
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:48,717
you gotta trust me...
cos I love you, you see.

1018
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:51,115
Now I can finally do for you like I want.

1019
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:55,438
- Carver, let go of me, please.
- Baby, I can't do that.

1020
01:31:55,560 --> 01:32:00,588
Sideburns blocking your hearing, boy?
She said let her go.

1021
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,990
Kids! Goddammit!

1022
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,632
(screaming)

1023
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,955
Get out of here now!

1024
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:43,993
Counting up the goodies?
As I recall, our deal was 50/50...

1025
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:46,839
Our deal didn't say a thing
about last night.

1026
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:49,793
Or about blowing Freemanville to hell.

1027
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:54,994
Sorry I hit you. But as for the town, you
mustn't fret it. It was a dead man's dream.

1028
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,588
Sooner or later, people gotta wake up.

1029
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:00,553
King David and Jessie dreamed too much.

1030
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:04,229
Jessie don't understand
about straight business. I do.

1031
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,874
Why don't you teach me?

1032
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:13,029
Go ahead, Jessie. Kill him.

1033
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:47,674
Very clever, Jessie Lee.

1034
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:55,949
Come on out.

1035
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:02,036
We all got to go to hell someday.

1036
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,758
When you get there,
tell 'em Jessie Lee sent you.

1037
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,436
I wouldn't be too hasty.

1038
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:32,269
Put your gun away,
go get my gold and come on over.

1039
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:35,878
Hurry up. Things could get hot.

1040
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,431
Jessie Lee, so good of you to come.

1041
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:54,393
You got the gold.
Why don't you let the lady go?

1042
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:57,910
Right, I've got my reward.

1043
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:01,316
But there's a question...

1044
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,590
of retribution.

1045
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:07,474
You know... an eye for an eye.

1046
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:15,475
She's got such lovely eyes.

1047
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:19,910
This is between you and me, Graham.
Let the girl go.

1048
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:22,076
Wrong! That's where you're wrong!

1049
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:26,432
You're in no position to question
my strategic command!

1050
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:30,917
Your strategic command was a joke.

1051
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,560
Even old walrus here knew that.

1052
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:36,955
Now you talk about being a coward.

1053
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:39,389
You're shooting at an unarmed woman.

1054
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:42,557
You told me once
you could tell a man by his profile.

1055
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:47,435
See, your profile look like
you from the Mo Scar Sir tribe.

1056
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:55,071
No.

1057
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:58,434
(click)

1058
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:01,358
She's such a lucky girl.

1059
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:34,598
You're too late, Jessie.
The place is gonna blow.

1060
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:51,195
(Bates) Come on, Jessie Lee!

1061
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:34,234
(Lana) Jessie, it's gonna explode!

1062
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:36,316
Jessie! Jessie!

1063
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:56,438
(Lana coughs and splutters)

1064
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:19,672
Jessie, your good luck book
stopped the bullet.

1065
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:23,236
Jessie, the book's not hurt.
No way. Not inside.

1066
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:28,150
Don't you worry about that, big brother.
You're gonna be just fine.

1067
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:32,834
(mouths)

1068
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:39,071
What about the town?

1069
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:45,469
Obobo, with all the gold we got, we could
rebuild Freemanville better than ever.

1070
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:49,318
And that's what we're gonna do.

1071
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,352
Read to me, Jess.

1072
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,749
(Obobo coughs)

1073
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:01,678
OK, listen.

1074
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:05,270
"Nicodemus was a slave of African birth."

1075
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,756
"He was bought for a bagful of gold."

1076
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,599
"He was reckoned
a part of the salt of the earth,

1077
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:14,473
but he died years ago, very old."

1078
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:19,517
That sounds so pretty, Jess.

1079
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:21,153
Say right there.

1080
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:25,751
"Nicodemus was a prophet,
at least, he was wise,

1081
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:28,075
for he told of battles to come."

1082
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:31,556
"How we trembled with fear
when he rolled up his eyes,

1083
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:34,558
and we heeded the shake of his thumb."

1084
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:37,319
"Good time coming. Good time coming."

1085
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:40,955
"Long, long time on the way."

1086
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:47,349
"Run, tell Elijah to hurry up Pomp

1087
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:52,076
to meet us under the cottonwood tree..."

1088
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:59,356
"...cottonwood tree in the Great Solomon
Valley at the first break of day."

Hey, the machine stopped.

1091
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:09,193
So, you were the kid?

1092
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:14,118
Thank you very much, sir.

1093
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:16,629
I think we got it.

1094
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,551
Hey!

1095
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:21,113
Not everything.
