22
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,479
Grandpa!

23
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,536
Grandpa, get up. Get up, Grandpa.

24
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,698
- Another mare's gone.
- Huh?

25
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,373
- Another mare's gone. It's Lady Hanover.
- Lady Hanover?

26
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:11,126
She was run off by some stallion.
His hoofprints are all over the place.

27
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,753
By ginger, it's that Thunderhead.

28
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:19,845
- Well, don't stand there. Let's go after her.
- It's too late. She's dead.

29
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:20,963
Dead?

30
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:26,218
She tried to jump that gulch in the upper
pasture. I found her lying down at the bottom.

31
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,353
Lady Hanover.

32
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,275
The finest trotting mare a man ever had.

33
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,396
Why, it was only last spring
we bred her to Willie D.

34
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,564
I was counting on her colt.

35
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:40,191
- I'm sorry, Grandpa.
- Don't you feel sorry for me!

36
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:46,537
By ginger, I'm going to tell those
McLaughlins a thing or two. You just wait.

37
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,502
Ohh...

38
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,716
Tell me, was I very...?

39
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,050
Yes.

40
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,847
- What day is it?
- Tuesday.

41
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,477
Tuesday.

42
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:09,765
You've been that way since Sunday.

43
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,696
I'll put the coffee on.

44
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,712
Oh! Carey...

45
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,468
Pump for me, will you?

46
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,045
Honest, ducky, this is the last time.

47
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,840
- Yes, I know. Put your head down.
- Ohh!

48
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:50,520
Hey, what are you trying to do? Drown me?

49
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,357
Ouch! Ouch, you're scalping me!

50
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:01,444
I came here to look after you,
and I'm going to, even if it hurts.

51
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,814
There.

52
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,365
Thanks for leaving my head on my shoulders.

53
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,324
Wash your hands.
I'll have breakfast ready in a minute.

54
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,906
All right.

55
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,919
Never mind breakfast.
I just remembered I'm mad.

56
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,373
- You're not going to start a fuss.
- I'm not, eh?

57
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:22,887
Thunderhead has stolen two of my mares and
if Rob McLaughlin won't do something, I will.

58
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,221
I'll not have you fight with Mr McLaughlin.
It's not neighbourly.

59
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:29,392
Grandpa, please wait till you feel better.

60
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:34,638
If I didn't feel as well as I do, I wouldn't
stand here arguing with you. Now scat.

61
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:52,703
I hope Ken doesn't forget those skillets. This
one's impossible. Just look at these eggs.

62
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,248
That kid should've been back last night.

63
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,753
It's a long pull from Los Angeles,
especially dragging a trailer.

64
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:02,506
I know, but that boy's got a genius
for getting into trouble.

65
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,219
<i>(knock at door)</i>

66
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:09,089
If you fight with the McLaughlins,
no one in 20 miles will talk to you.

67
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:13,312
No man's stallion's gonna
steal my mares and get away with it.

68
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:18,106
- Well, Carey, Beaver, come on in.
- McLaughlin, I've lost another mare.

69
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,111
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
- He's sorry, he says.

70
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,485
It's the second mare Thunderhead has stolen.

71
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:26,243
Wait a minute.
How do you know it's Thunderhead?

72
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,075
Nobody's even seen him since
we turned him loose a couple of years ago.

73
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:35,039
It's Thunderhead. You know what I'm gonna
do? I'm gonna hunt him down and shoot him.

74
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:40,287
You got a perfect right to shoot him - if you
catch him at it. You haven't even seen him.

75
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,798
- Are you calling me a liar?
- Please excuse him, Mr McLaughlin.

76
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:47,301
- No man calls me a liar and gets away with it.
- Will you be reasonable?

77
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,141
I'll get word around
to watch out for a mare-stealer...

78
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:54,686
That's all I want to know. I come here
for a little action and all I get is a lot of talk.

79
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,057
I'll handle this thing my own way.

80
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,646
- I'm sorry. He doesn't really mean it.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.

81
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,315
- Carey!
- Coming, Grandpa.

82
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,901
Goodbye, Mr McLaughlin.

83
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,212
Come on, Sundown, let's get outta here.

84
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,170
Hyah!

85
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,257
Huh! Calling me a liar
and sticking up for Thunderhead.

86
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,668
- Why do you have to fight with everybody?
- Me?

87
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,300
- If only you'd stop drinking.
- Stop drinking?

88
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,225
I only take a thimbleful
just to settle my nerves.

89
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:37,648
If only you would, and start training Sundown
again, then everything would be different.

90
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,020
You took the words right out of my mouth.

91
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:44,272
That's exactly what I'm gonna
start doing tomorrow - you watch me.

92
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,658
Hello! Pull up a minute.
I got a surprise for you.

93
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:53,788
- You're the one who's got a surprise coming.
- Hey! Wait a minute!

94
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:59,163
- I'll see you later, Ken.
- You keep away from those McLaughlins.

95
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,386
Do you think Thunderhead stole the mares?

96
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:15,850
If he's alive, I'm afraid so. A lot of mares
have been stolen lately besides Beaver's.

97
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,015
What are you gonna do?

98
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:21,932
If we pick up his trail soon after a mare's been
stolen, we've a good chance of catching him.

99
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,563
Then you'll have to shoot him?

100
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,229
- Yeah.
- I'm afraid that'll break Ken's heart.

101
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,576
- Kenny!
- Hi, Gus!

102
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,029
- How are things in the city?
- Great. I got a surprise in the trailer.

103
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,039
Surprises I like don't come in trailers!

104
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,784
- Ken!
- Hello, Mom. Your skillets.

105
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,119
- Thank you, son.
- Hiya, Dad.

106
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,000
The horses come through in good shape?
Mr McNulty pay you?

107
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,709
- Yes, sir. And have I got a surprise for you.
- What is it this time?

108
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,175
The most wonderful thing happened.

109
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:55,384
- I met a friend of yours, Whitey Eaton...
- A friend of mine?

110
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,263
- He let me in on a terrific deal.
- Whitey Eaton did?

111
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:03,015
- He's the crookedest horse-dealer this side...
- You've mixed him up with someone else.

112
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,686
<i>(banging)</i>

113
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,398
- Take it easy, baby.
- She looks fine, Kenny.

114
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,437
What have you got in that trailer?
Did you let Whitey Eaton sell you a horse?

115
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:15,483
Sure. And is she a beauty.
Hey, let's get her out, Gus.

116
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,951
Just a minute, young man.

117
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,491
Did you take the 2200 McNulty paid you
for the polo ponies

118
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:25,583
and give it to Whitey Eaton
for some broken-down piece of crowbait?

119
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:30,050
- Why, Mr Eaton says she's a sure winner.
- I told you, Whitey Eaton is a crook!

120
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:35,260
I can't agree with you, Dad. I think this mare
is a very sound business investment.

121
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,009
- Come on, take a look.
- What...

122
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:43,642
- What is she, Kenny?
- A trotter. Let me get this blanket off.

123
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,320
- There you are.
- Rob, she's beautiful.

124
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:54,071
Yeah, I've seen Whitey's
beautiful horses before. Come here, son.

125
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,781
Telephone him and tell him
I don't want this mare,

126
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,702
and after breakfast tomorrow,
you're going back to Los Angeles with it.

127
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:04,290
- I don't think so, Dad.
- You... you what?

128
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,047
You said that on my next birthday
I'll be a partner.

129
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,586
If so, I'm gonna have something to say.

130
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:12,426
You'll never be a partner
pulling stunts like this.

131
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:16,805
At least you can let him show her. All Ken
knows about horses is what you taught him.

132
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,891
She's by Bolomite out of
Margaret Castledon - both champions.

133
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,969
You can't beat that breeding.

134
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,683
Well, all right.
Trot her out. Let's see her.

135
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,399
Come on, baby.

136
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,058
Come on, baby, trot. Come on.

137
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:35,899
- Buying a horse without consulting me.
- I'm sure she'll be all right.

138
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,243
Here. Here, stop that. Down, girl!

139
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,076
- Uh-oh.
- Ken, be careful.

140
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:47,003
Whoa! Hey, what's the matter with you?
Down, girl!

141
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,581
I told you about Whitey.

142
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,245
What's the matter?
Something's bothering her.

143
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:54,924
Listen to her. She's wind-broken,
that's what's the matter with her.

144
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,467
2200 bucks right up the flue.

145
00:09:57,556 --> 00:10:01,256
Boss, it might be the altitude.
It's 8200ft up here.

146
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,427
Yeah, that's it. It's the altitude.

147
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,185
Let her take it easy for a while
till her lungs fill out. Then she'll be fine.

148
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:10,109
Yeah, maybe.
Meanwhile, you'd better put her up, Gus.

149
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:14,108
- I'll take her, Gus.
- No, you stay here. I want a talk with you.

150
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:18,361
I'm sorry I bought her like I did, Dad.
I should have spoken to you first, but...

151
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:22,615
If you're going to be a partner, you can't
just use snap judgment about things.

152
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:26,157
Before I do anything,
I always talk it over with your mother.

153
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,623
- Well, I do.
- Of course, darling.

154
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,285
Why don't you think
before you do these things?

155
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,299
I did. I put myself right in your place.

156
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,421
I knew that you'd have bought her
if you'd been in my place.

157
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:40,004
What's the use? I give up!

158
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:46,184
I do too, I guess.
He won't take my judgment on anything.

159
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,783
- Hey, Ken.
- Yes, sir?

160
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,576
I've changed my mind.
I'll let you keep the mare.

161
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:09,117
- You will? Gee, that's great...
- Wait. Under these conditions.

162
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:12,710
She's your responsibility,
and she'll have to pay for her own keep.

163
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:16,748
Once she's brought back her costs,
then we'll take you into partnership.

164
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:20,378
That's very fair of you, Dad.
Thank you. And you too, Mom.

165
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:24,766
There's one other little matter.
Might as well let you have it all at once.

166
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,425
- Yes, sir?
- Beaver Greenway was just here.

167
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:31,768
- Thunderhead stole another one of his mares.
- Thunderhead did?

168
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34,147
But we don't even know he's alive.

169
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:40,488
Well, if he is, Beaver's gonna shoot him.
And if I see him first, I'm afraid I'll have to.

170
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:44,070
<i>(neighing)</i>

171
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:06,514
- So that's your surprise!
- You like her?

172
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,313
From here I'd say she looks pretty good.

173
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,857
Come on, baby, show her your stuff.

174
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,570
Now, settle down. Easy, girl.

175
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,149
Easy. Trot. Trot.

176
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,697
Trot.

177
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,081
Whoa. Settle down. Trot.

178
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,839
Ah, stop that. Behave yourself.

179
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:39,042
- She's a little green yet.
- Yes, I can see that.

180
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:44,010
Now, come on. Come on, baby,
you know better than that. Trot.

181
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:48,976
- I believe she's got something.
- I got a hunch the moment I laid eyes on her.

182
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,552
Whoa! That's enough for today.
Whoa, Jewel.

183
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:53,390
- Jewel?
- Yeah. Crown Jewel.

184
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:57,526
That's a nice name. I like it.
She's blowing. Have you worked her hard?

185
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:00,149
No, it's the altitude. It got her at first,

186
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:04,023
but soon she'll have lung power
and stamina to burn. Won't you, baby?

187
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,822
- You look at a horse the way my father did.
- I do?

188
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:08,454
Mother used to say,

189
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:13,035
"If you looked at me the way you look at
your prize hunter, I'd faint with delight."

190
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,330
Must've been quite a guy,
your father. Thanks.

191
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,497
Come on, Jewel.

192
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:23,094
There we are. Be a good girl
and I'll get you some hay.

193
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:26,713
- You throw it down and I'll give it to her.
- OK.

194
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,771
- Is that all you're giving her?
- Isn't it enough?

195
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,564
It wouldn't be for my horses.

196
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,147
- Oh, Ken!
<i>- (Laughs)</i>

197
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,032
How was that?

198
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:49,736
Ken, what are you doing?! <i>(coughs)</i>

199
00:13:57,296 --> 00:14:00,830
- Hey, where's the ladder?
- Ladder? What ladder?

200
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:04,258
- Come on, put it back.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

201
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,633
You don't, eh?

202
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,883
Hey! Cut it out!

203
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,389
So that's the way you want to play.

204
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,559
Oh, Ken!

205
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:28,657
- I'm sorry.
- You are? Why?

206
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:31,910
- I shouldn't be roughhousing with you.
- You didn't hurt me.

207
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:34,037
That's not what I mean.

208
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:37,458
You seem different today, somehow.

209
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:41,459
Maybe it's because you've never
looked at me before - really.

210
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,383
No. I guess I never did.

211
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:47,718
I'd better get to work.
I promised Dad I'd fix the corral fence.

212
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,220
- I'll help you.
- Building fences is a man's job.

213
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:52,674
Oh.

214
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,769
Very well. If I'm in the way, then I'll go home.

215
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:59,188
No, don't go. I'm glad you came.

216
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:03,272
I was thinking yesterday that you haven't
been over to go riding for a while.

217
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:06,565
- I can't be coming over here all the time.
- Why not?

218
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:09,693
I have a home too,
in case anybody should be interested.

219
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:12,951
- You mean I should come to see you?
- Are you asking for a date?

220
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:16,621
- Well, I...
- Saturday evening would be the best time.

221
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,081
We don't have a radio to dance to,

222
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:23,546
but from our porch you can almost hear
the dance music from Cave Lakes.

223
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:26,419
- I'll bet it's beautiful.
- Do you like to dance?

224
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,508
- You mean we have a date?
- Well... sure!

225
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,886
Saturday evening.

226
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,528
- Hey, Ken!
- Shh!

227
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,484
We're having dinner
an hour early for him and he's late.

228
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:54,533
He'll be right down. And don't kid him.
Remember, it's his first date.

229
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,112
I won't say a word.

230
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:12,503
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's perfectly all right, dear.

231
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:16,642
Well, pardon me. Haven't I seen
that necktie someplace before?

232
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:18,435
Yes, sir. It's yours.

233
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,897
My tie. Don't you think it's a little bit
early for you to start using my things?

234
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:26,186
- After all, we're not partners yet.
- No, sir.

235
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,362
Hey, uh... what'd you do to your chin?

236
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:31,654
- Oh, nothing, it's just a little...
- Cut.

237
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:34,067
Cut? How on earth did...?

238
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,996
- It couldn't possibly be a razor cut, could it?
- Rob!

239
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,998
- You have been using my razor, haven't you?
- Yes, sir.

240
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,203
- You see, I've got a date.
- A date?!

241
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,839
- With Carey Greenway, I suppose?
- Yes, sir.

242
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:51,843
- Planning to take her dancing, I suppose?
- Yes, sir.

243
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,965
And after that, to Red Slade's
for some supper, I suppose?

244
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:58,058
- Yes, sir.
- Well, why didn't you say so?

245
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:01,393
Here's five bucks. Have a good time.

246
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,556
Well, thanks.

247
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:32,759
Your supper's on the table.

248
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,863
Carey.

249
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,657
Carey!

250
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:14,717
Carey!

251
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:19,473
It's me, ducky.

252
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:22,927
I only had one drink. Just a little one.

253
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,934
- You'd better go down and have your supper.
- Doggone it, I was cold.

254
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:31,686
I've been up in those hills searching
for that stallion. It's just discouraging.

255
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:35,147
You know I don't want to drink.
I hate the stuff.

256
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,360
But somehow everything's
been going wrong with me lately.

257
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:40,859
But don't think I haven't been trying.

258
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:44,039
- I thought you were going to work Sundown.
- Tomorrow.

259
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,825
Tomorrow I'll get Sundown going
like he's never gone before.

260
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,546
We'll enter him in the Governor's Stake,
and then everything'll be peaches and cream.

261
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,468
It's always going to be
peaches and cream tomorrow.

262
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:59,420
There you go, discouraging me again.
Honest, ducky, I promise.

263
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:03,808
First thing in the morning I'll hook up
Sundown and get going. Is it a bargain?

264
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,349
- It is if you mean it.
- Sure I mean it.

265
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:10,187
You'll see. This old boy isn't finished yet.
Not by ajugful.

266
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,609
By ginger, we're gonna win that race.
I feel it in my bones.

267
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:17,823
We'll get my farm back in Connecticut.
I'll drive in the Grand Circuit again.

268
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:21,775
- And you'll have a trunkful of pretty dresses.
- Grandpa, please!

269
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,779
Well, you will.

270
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:29,626
Say, let me look at you. You look real swell.
How come you're all rigged out like that?

271
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:34,457
- I've got a date. With Ken McLaughlin.
- Didn't I tell you about those McLaughlins?

272
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,835
- You know, they have a trotter too.
- Huh?

273
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:42,139
A beautiful black mare. I think they're
going to get her ready for Lancaster too.

274
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:46,008
First they steal my mares,
now they want to win the Governor's Stake.

275
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:48,179
They will if you don't get busy.

276
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:53,017
A fine chance they have of beating Beaver
Greenway, those Johnny-come-latelies.

277
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,435
You stay away from those McLaughlins.

278
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,771
Go down and have your supper.

279
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:00,272
You heard me, now.

280
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:11,284
McLaughlins.

281
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,834
Stealing my horses.

282
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:16,496
Buying a trotting mare, eh?

283
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,818
Hello, Mr Greenway. Nice evening.

284
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:48,078
- I hear you got a trotter.
- Yes, sir. She looks like a winner.

285
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,703
- She does, eh?
- Well, I think so. Is Carey ready?

286
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:54,458
- She ain't going out tonight.
- She isn't? Why? Is she sick?

287
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:58,544
- Yeah. Sick of McLaughlins.
- What? Oh, you're kidding.

288
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:02,466
I am, am I? Well, suppose you just scat.

289
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:07,050
- Carey and I have a date to go dancing.
- Just dance yourself back home.

290
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,716
- Does Carey know about this?
- I told you to scat.

291
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:12,100
Now, when I say scat, I mean scat.

292
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:14,228

- Hey, Ken.
- Yes, sir?

295
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:22,196
Don't get no idea in your head
your mare can beat Sundown.

296
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,608
No horse can touch him
when he's going good.

297
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:28,402
- That's what you think.
- That's what I know.

298
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,376
Huh.

299
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,078

It's just that he's getting old and he's lonely.

00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:50,189
If I don't take good care of him and get him

- I would if he was my grandfather.
- Maybe you're right.

381
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:05,620
If I go home now, he'll think
he's won his point, that I'm just a child.

00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,369
Now you're talking.

Maybe I'm just naturally mean.

But I've never been mean to you,
have I, Sundown?

I'm gonna get you out of this place.

But don't you worry.

404

We'll do it again. Yes, sir,
everything's gonna be just as it was.

You just watch.

406
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,997
We'll get our farm back in Connecticut.

00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:18,446
<i>(Gus) Before long
the ranger reported to the boss.</i>

445
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:24,205
<i>Him and Kenny and bunch of ranchers
started to Thunderhead's hideout.</i>

446
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:31,252
<i>Took two days and two nights of packing
over country no one had ever seen before.</i>

447
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:36,547
<i>Then they arrived at a mesa
high enough to scare a mountain goat.</i>

448
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:42,975
<i>Some of the boys wanted to call it a day, but
the boss and old Beaver, they wouldn't quit.</i>

449
00:35:47,022 --> 00:35:52,443
<i>Well, sir, when they finally got to the top, they
crossed to the opposite side of the mesa,</i>

450
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:58,281
<i>keeping a little ridge between them and
where they figured Thunderhead should be.</i>

451

<i>Kenny's heart was in his mouth

<i>He wanted to get Jewel back, but he sure
didn't want 'em to kill Thunderhead.</i>

<i>(Ken)</i> There they are! And isn't that Jewel?

454
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:18,220
I bet I can get a bead on him from here.

455
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:21,257
- Do you want to scare him and the mares?
- Stop that.

456
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:24,634
You'll get a chance at Thunderhead
after we've rounded up the herd.

457
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:28,178
Hey, Joe. Take some of the boys
and spook 'em up to the far end.

458

We'll cut 'em off on the other side

- I could've sworn they came this way.
- You're trying to protect Thunderhead.

How does she look, Doc?

- I don't think so, Ken.

With the leg, you've got
nothing to worry about,

but her lungs are so badly congested
that I'm afraid there's nothing else I can do.

- But you can't just give up.
- I'm sorry, Ken, I've done my best.

529
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:46,479
- If she were my mare, I'd destroy her.
- Destroy her?!

530

- Do you want me to...?
- No. No, we'll attend to that, thanks.

You know we would. We don't want
to destroy Jewel any more than you do.

Go with your mother, son.

We can't let her go on suffering.

give up. Let me try. I'll help her, I know I will.

I know I will.

548
00:51:34,052 --> 00:51:37,421
Congestion-reducer

- No, sir.
- Well, now, here. You try that.

550

That'll be a dollar and a quarter.

- Hello.

- Oh, hiya, Mort. Couple of sacks of oats.

558
00:52:23,602 --> 00:52:26,437
She was such a beautiful mare.

559
00:52:28,106 --> 00:52:30,514
It's a shame.

560
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:36,061
Seems to me, if I had a mare
with a congested lung...

561
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:39,691
Well, there's a lot of
old-fashioned tricks a man can play.

- Like what?
- These new-fangled vets wouldn't approve...

563
00:52:43,664 --> 00:52:46,415
Well, if I had a horse with a congested lung,

564
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,501
I'd try some aromatic oils and hot water,

565
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:53,798
and let her breathe the fumes up
through her nostrils. That might help.

566

- You think so?
- It might.

567
00:52:55,425 --> 00:52:58,177
- Why didn't you tell Ken?
- He didn't ask me.

568
00:52:58,262 --> 00:53:01,428
- Oh, Grandpa!
- Hey! Come back here!

569

Hey, Mort, better hold those oats.

00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:14,193
Looks like I won't have a car for a while.

571
00:53:15,696 --> 00:53:18,400
- That's enough.
- Now the oil.

572
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:26,786
- Smells awful.
- I don't care how it smells if it works.

573
00:53:26,874 --> 00:53:29,828
Here we are, baby.

574

Those kids are still with that mare. Carey
should be at home and he should be in bed.

576
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:49,009
Oh, let them alone. You used to pick on Ken
for starting something and never finishing it.

577
00:53:49,104 --> 00:53:51,725
All right. He's your son.

Then he tipped me off to this.
I guess I just don't understand him.

582

I have a hard time
understanding him myself sometimes.

You've been swell, Carey. It's wonderful to
have someone stick by you at a time like this.

585
00:54:14,796 --> 00:54:19,126
- You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you?
- Sure I would.

586
00:54:19,218 --> 00:54:24,295
You know, it's funny.
I never used to notice what you looked like.

Look at those kids.

596
00:55:13,272 --> 00:55:16,356
- She's getting up.
- I'll be darned.

Jewel!

Carey, she's better!

00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:24,408
- Look, Dad, I told you. She's better!
- Good work.

You're gonna be all right,
aren't you, girl? Sure!

to see Jewel up and around again.</i>

to be getting fatter and sassier every day.</i>

603
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:56,184
- She sure feels good.
- Yes, sir. I think she's gonna be all right.

Hey, Kenny.

I just had Jake Willis on the phone.
He's coming over here tomorrow.

606
00:56:01,904 --> 00:56:06,815
- If he likes the way Jewel goes, he'll train her.
- He will? Oh, say, that's swell.

- Quit that, will you?

Jiminy Christmas!

617
00:57:21,066 --> 00:57:27,318
That's a beautiful mess. Look at that stall.
Come on, get her out of there.

618
00:57:30,117 --> 00:57:32,738
Holy smoke. Did she cut herself, boss?

619
00:57:32,828 --> 00:57:36,991
- I don't know. Let me have a look at her.
- I wonder what's the matter with her now.

620
00:57:37,082 --> 00:57:41,411
Do you know what, Kenny? I think
she's in love. She misses Thunderhead.

621
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:44,255
- Yeah. It might be Thunderhead.
- Sure it is.

622
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:47,376
I'll bet he's hanging around here
someplace right now.

623
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:52,675
As far as I can see, she's OK.
Let's put her in this stall here.

624
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:05,641
- Now let's get some sleep.
- Go ahead, Dad. I'll stay here for a while.

625
00:58:05,736 --> 00:58:09,187
- All right.
- Good night, Kenny. You ought to sleep too.

626
00:58:09,281 --> 00:58:10,905
Night, Gus.

627
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:13,233
You'd better behave tomorrow, young lady.

628
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:16,945
Jake Willis is coming to see you,
and he's the best trainer around.

- You want him to take you, don't you?
<i>- (Whinnies)</i>

Sure you do.

631
00:58:52,366 --> 00:58:57,028
- What do you think, Mr Willis?
- Ain't what a man thinks, it's what he knows.

632
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,576
Well, uh, what do you know?

633
00:58:59,665 --> 00:59:01,622
I've seen worse.

634
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:05,788
- I think she's pretty good.
- Didn't say she wasn't.

635
00:59:12,344 --> 00:59:15,298
- Well?
- More folks asking questions.

636
00:59:15,389 --> 00:59:19,386
- That's what you came here for.
- I thought it was my company you was after.

637
00:59:19,476 --> 00:59:24,138
You got a good square-gaited trotter, Rob.
Might be able to do something with her.

638
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:29,356
- Then you mean you're gonna take her?
- Well, looking her over casual like I've been,

639
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:34,190
I'd say she's a whale of a prospect.
Bring her over to my place Saturday.

You won't have any trouble.
I guess Dad and I just started her wrong.

You ought to have her in a breaking cart,
not that thing. That comes later.

Go ahead. Hurry it up.

Well, that brazen son of a gun...

661

Look at him.
I could hit him with a rock. Kenny!

665

He's come after you, Jewel.
Now's our chance to catch him.

- She'll get away.

668

She won't. I can handle her.

669
01:01:57,634 --> 01:02:00,304
Now we'll lose her again.

670

Easy. Easy, girl. Easy. Easy.

671
01:02:09,396 --> 01:02:11,187
Talk to him, Jewel.

672

Talk to him.

Jump off her, Ken!
You want to get killed?

You've had this wild-goose chase
for nothing, my boy.

That won't do you any good either.

You're coming back to the ranch with me,
Thunderhead. Coming home. Understand?

684
01:03:45,158 --> 01:03:48,076
You want to come back, don't you?

685
01:03:49,288 --> 01:03:51,613
Sure you do.

Ah, stop that.

Steady now.

708
01:05:29,179 --> 01:05:31,255
Steady now.

709
01:05:34,184 --> 01:05:37,304
All right, boy. Let's go home.

710
01:05:37,396 --> 01:05:39,638
Come on, Jewel.

711
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:49,690
How do you like that?

712
01:05:49,783 --> 01:05:55,406
Whether I like it or not, it looks like
I've got that stud in the family again.

713
01:05:59,835 --> 01:06:04,331
<i>(Gus) Now that Thunderhead was
home to stay, Jewel was as happy as a lark.</i>

714
01:06:04,423 --> 01:06:08,883
<i>But she wouldn't work a lick unless
the old boy was right on the track with her.</i>

715
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:13,970
<i>Then pretty soon
she settled down and worked fine.</i>

716
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:18,600
<i>Just as long as she knew
Thunderhead was close by.</i>

717
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,931
You're still sawing at her mouth.

718
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:25,817
Look at her.

719
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:33,608
- Looks like I'll never get it.
- Oh, yes, you will.

720
01:06:33,702 --> 01:06:37,071
Just sit up straight and ease off on your lines.

721
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:40,497
You talk to a horse
with your voice and your hands.

722
01:06:40,584 --> 01:06:44,498
Your hands are light,
you talk gentle and encouraging.

723
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:47,708
When they're heavy,
you're talking mean and ugly.

724
01:06:47,799 --> 01:06:50,290
- I'll try, Jake.
- Yeah.

725
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:52,923
You know, Jewel carries her head to the left.

726
01:06:53,013 --> 01:06:55,800
Oh, I'll show you how to fix that.

727
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:57,765
<i>(Gus) Jake was a smart old codger.</i>

728
01:06:57,851 --> 01:07:01,801
<i>The sawed-off billiard cue
made Jewel trot as straight as you please.</i>

729
01:07:01,897 --> 01:07:08,516
<i>And the sheepskin roll... Well, that stopped
her from seeing shadows and being scared.</i>

730
01:07:08,612 --> 01:07:11,068
<i>She kept improving every day,</i>

731
01:07:11,156 --> 01:07:15,984
<i>and it wasn't long before Jake figured she was
ready to step out and show some real speed.</i>

732
01:07:16,078 --> 01:07:20,407
Let her step around at about a 250 gait,
but come the last quarter in 32.

733
01:07:20,499 --> 01:07:21,332
OK.

734
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:24,500
We gotta teach her to leave the wire fast
and come home fast.

735
01:07:33,428 --> 01:07:36,548
Pull up to the wire.
I want to see how good that mare is.

736
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:42,180
- Ken'll think we're spying on him, Grandpa.
- That's what we're doing. Pull up to the wire.

737
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:00,861
<i>(Jake)</i> Now.

738
01:08:29,902 --> 01:08:32,571
She made that last quarter
in 32 and two-fifths.

739
01:08:32,654 --> 01:08:38,325
- Not bad for a green trotter.
- Not bad. Not bad at all. Pretty good, in fact.

740
01:08:42,664 --> 01:08:45,950
Let's go down and congratulate the boy.

741
01:08:46,043 --> 01:08:49,459
- How was it?
- The mare looked pretty good.

742
01:08:49,546 --> 01:08:52,583
Now you've got to learn
some of the manoeuvres and ethics.

743
01:08:55,302 --> 01:08:59,216
- Huh. What's that old scallywag up to?
- He's just curious, I guess.

744
01:08:59,306 --> 01:09:02,177
He's curious all right.
Didn't learn nothing, though.

745
01:09:02,267 --> 01:09:06,846
Nice work, boys. Nice work. How are you,
Jake? The little mare looks great, son.

746
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:09,893
- You've done wonders with her, Ken.
- Mr Willis has.

747
01:09:09,983 --> 01:09:13,732
Well, there's plenty to do yet.
You can see that, can't you, Beaver?

748
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:17,984
- Well, I wasn't watching very close.
- Yeah? Better cool her off, put her away.

749
01:09:18,075 --> 01:09:20,696
- OK. Wanna help me, Carey?
- I'd love to.

750
01:09:20,786 --> 01:09:22,909
She hardly turned a hair.

751
01:09:22,996 --> 01:09:26,994
- That little mare of yours has what it takes.
- That's something coming from you.

752
01:09:27,084 --> 01:09:30,784
You can't tell what's inside her
unless you get in real competition.

753
01:09:30,879 --> 01:09:33,964
Then it's drivers that count
as much as horses.

754
01:09:34,049 --> 01:09:37,050
The best horse ain't worth a lick
with a greenhorn behind him.

755
01:09:37,135 --> 01:09:41,465
- Ken is not exactly a greenhorn, Grandpa.
- Course he ain't. Who said he was?

756
01:09:41,557 --> 01:09:43,882
- And it's a good thing too.
- Yeah? Why?

757
01:09:43,976 --> 01:09:48,305
Greenhorns always freeze to the reins
when the going gets tough.

758
01:09:48,397 --> 01:09:52,062
Especially when they get pocketed
by three or four wise old joes like me.

759
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:53,265
Grandpa!

760
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:57,061
I remember once in Lexington
there was a kid there about your age.

761
01:09:57,155 --> 01:10:01,023
He was driving his first race, too.
He got pocketed down by the rail.

762
01:10:01,118 --> 01:10:03,407
The driver in front pulled up unexpectedly,

763
01:10:03,495 --> 01:10:07,244
and that kid's horse put his foot
smack in the other fella's wheel.

764
01:10:07,332 --> 01:10:10,618
- What happened?
- They had to destroy both those horses.

765
01:10:10,711 --> 01:10:12,869
That kid never drove another race.

766
01:10:12,963 --> 01:10:16,083
- I think we'd better go.
- Yes, I guess it's time.

767
01:10:16,175 --> 01:10:18,962
Don't you worry, son.
You're doing fine. Just fine.

768
01:10:19,052 --> 01:10:21,128
See you later, Ken.

769
01:10:25,142 --> 01:10:28,926
Why'd you tell him those terrible things?
You scared him half to death.

770
01:10:29,021 --> 01:10:32,853
Who, me? I was just trying
to give the kid a few pointers.

771
01:10:35,777 --> 01:10:37,521
<i>(Gus) It was a long drive,</i>

772
01:10:37,613 --> 01:10:41,824
<i>but here we were at Lancaster, Ohio,
the heart of the trotting-horse country.</i>

773
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:45,443
<i>The fairground was already
waking up to some real activity.</i>

774
01:10:45,537 --> 01:10:48,704
<i>Those horses were pouring in
from every state in the union</i>

775
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:51,364
<i>to compete for the Governor's Cup.</i>

776
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:56,751
<i>How was I betting? I'd just planked down
a week's pay on Jewel's nose.</i>

777
01:10:57,966 --> 01:11:00,042
<i>(honks horn)</i>

778
01:11:01,845 --> 01:11:03,553
<i>(Thunderhead neighs)</i>

779
01:11:05,265 --> 01:11:09,643
- Thunderhead thinks we're gonna race him.
- I just hope he behaves himself.

780
01:11:09,728 --> 01:11:14,057
I hope you stop growing
and spreading out all over the seat.

781
01:11:16,318 --> 01:11:22,403
Ah, there's nothing like the smell of the
fairground in trotting season. Or a good cigar.

782
01:11:22,491 --> 01:11:28,659
You didn't think I'd make it, did you, ducky?
Well, I fooled you, and I'll fool everybody else.

783
01:11:28,747 --> 01:11:33,124
We'll have my farm back in Connecticut.
I'll follow the Grand Circuit, and...

784
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:35,783
Grandpa, you could lose, you know.

785
01:11:35,879 --> 01:11:38,666
There are other good horses in the race
besides Sundown.

786
01:11:38,757 --> 01:11:43,964
You can cheer for that McLaughlin boy if you
want, but just a couple of times, to be polite.

787
01:11:50,143 --> 01:11:54,473
<i>(PA) Ladies and gentlemen, we're ready for
the 26th running of the Governor's Stake.</i>

788
01:11:54,565 --> 01:11:56,474
<i>14-class trotters.</i>

789
01:11:56,567 --> 01:11:59,140
<i>A purse of $5,000 added.</i>

790
01:11:59,236 --> 01:12:01,905
<i>The best two in three.</i>

791
01:12:07,077 --> 01:12:10,493
A smart driver's always out to win.
You've got a young mare.

792
01:12:10,581 --> 01:12:15,788
The sooner you bring her in, the better.
Don't take any chances. Good luck.

793
01:12:18,589 --> 01:12:20,795
<i>Eight starters are being led to the post</i>

794

<i>Introducing to you

796
01:12:29,266 --> 01:12:32,433
<i>Dillola Lord, No.1, Dr Parshall up.</i>

01:12:40,527 --> 01:12:45,273
<i>Crown Jewel is No.4, Mr Kenneth McLaughlin
up, a newcomer to our sport.</i>

800
01:12:45,365 --> 01:12:47,691
Relax, Ken. Now, just relax.

801
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:50,406
He's all right. He knows what he's doing.

802
01:12:50,495 --> 01:12:53,580
<i>6, Miss Bosise,
owned and driven by S Dunwiddy.</i>

803
01:12:53,665 --> 01:12:57,793
<i>7, Sundown, the holder of the track record
of two-four and one half.</i>

804
01:12:57,878 --> 01:13:01,543
<i>Beaver Greenway up,
whom we welcome back to our sport.</i>

805

<i>No.8, Cosharo, Boston Shilling.</i>

806
01:13:05,177 --> 01:13:08,877
Sundown looks fine. It's sure great
to see old Beaver out there again.

807
01:13:08,972 --> 01:13:12,555
That's where he belongs, Mr McLaughlin.

808
01:13:12,643 --> 01:13:17,305
<i>(PA) On the inside, we have Mr Dunwiddy
and Mr Evers and Ken McLaughlin.</i>

<i>(whinnies)</i>

Take 'em on up there, gentlemen. Well up.
Everybody turn 'em, now.

811
01:13:24,071 --> 01:13:27,440
<i>Dr Parshall, your horse is at the rail.

812
01:13:27,533 --> 01:13:32,444
<i>McLaughlin, get over a little bit farther.
Come on, Greenway, get your horse up there.</i>

813
01:13:32,538 --> 01:13:38,042
<i>Wait on him on the outside here now. Careful
with him. Not too fast. Let this horse through.</i>

01:13:38,126 --> 01:13:39,621
<i>Very nice. Go!</i>

815
01:13:41,338 --> 01:13:45,122
<i>It's Dillola Lord on top. Caroline C's second.</i>

<i>- Crown Jewel third, Sundown fourth...
- (neighs)</i>

817
01:13:51,515 --> 01:13:53,970
Don't worry, boy. She knows you're here.

818
01:13:54,601 --> 01:13:56,060
<i>...Crown Jewel.</i>

819
01:13:56,144 --> 01:13:59,430
Coming up that back lane,
Dillola Lord out in front by a length.

820
01:13:59,523 --> 01:14:02,275
It's Caroline C second.

821
01:14:02,359 --> 01:14:04,186
<i>Crown Jewel is third.</i>

822
01:14:04,278 --> 01:14:07,481
<i>Coming around here now, still Dillola Lord.</i>

823

<i>Crown Jewel is trotting very fast into second
position. Sundown has moved up to third.</i>

<i>Greenway making a drive now

Come on, Grandpa!

826
01:14:19,751 --> 01:14:20,831
Grandpa!

<i>...Crown Jewel, Sundown.</i>

<i>It's still Dillola Lord.</i>

830

Come on, Kenny! Now's the time to let her go!

831
01:14:35,976 --> 01:14:39,392
<i>It's still Dillola Lord...</i>

832
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:42,017
Now, Jewel. Come on, girl. Let's go.

833
01:14:42,107 --> 01:14:45,191
<i>...Crown Jewel. Here she comes.

That's the stuff, Kenny!

836
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:50,445
- Ken took the lead.
- It's still anybody's.

837
01:14:50,532 --> 01:14:51,730
You bet it is.

838
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:56,493
<i>And it's still Crown Jewel.
Sundown is on her trail.</i>

839
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:57,955
Coming through!

840

<i>Greenway makes his drive.

<i>Here they are racing neck and neck

01:15:04,505 --> 01:15:09,048
<i>Looky here. There's a little trouble back there.
And Mr Greenway has his wheel locked in...</i>

843
01:15:09,134 --> 01:15:11,506
- Get off me!
- Keep your shirt on!

844
01:15:11,595 --> 01:15:13,422
Watch him. He's a trickster.

845
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:19,971
<i>They're coming out of it. Still Crown Jewel.
Sundown moves up beside her.</i>

- Come on, Ken.
- Come on, Grandpa!

847

<i>Jewel is trotting very fast now.
She's out on top again.</i>

<i>They're trotting like a pair.
They're side by side.</i>

849
01:15:28,862 --> 01:15:30,938
Come on, Kenny! Let her go!

850
01:15:31,657 --> 01:15:36,235
<i>Heading down the lane now. It's still
Sundown who's out on top by a length.</i>

851
01:15:36,328 --> 01:15:41,323
<i>Now it's Crown Jewel who's out in front.
She's a little ahead of him now.</i>

852
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,957
<i>And Crown Jewel is trotting fast
and Sundown is right at her.</i>

853
01:15:47,047 --> 01:15:51,175
<i>And here they are...
Oh! Crown Jewel breaks her gait.</i>

854
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:52,422
Jewel's broke!

855
01:15:52,511 --> 01:15:54,717
Uh-oh...

856
01:15:54,805 --> 01:15:58,719
<i>...with Sundown. He's moving up to her.
Crown Jewel still on a break...</i>

857
01:15:58,809 --> 01:16:01,514
- Get her back in her trot, Ken!
- Catch on to her, Kenny!

858
01:16:01,603 --> 01:16:05,518
<i>Sundown is trotting fast. Here he comes
on the outside... He's the winner!</i>

859
01:16:05,607 --> 01:16:07,516
Come on!

860
01:16:09,903 --> 01:16:12,821
Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa!

861
01:16:12,906 --> 01:16:17,367
- Oh, he won! He said he would and he did!
- Good. Good. Come on.

862
01:16:17,452 --> 01:16:19,244
Oh!

863
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:24,916
<i>(applause and cheering)</i>

864
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:27,243
You made a nice try. What happened?

865
01:16:27,337 --> 01:16:31,169
Jewel lost her shoe. I hope it didn't hit her.

866
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:40,216
- There you are. Go out and win the next heat.
- I'd better.

867
01:16:40,309 --> 01:16:43,678
We ain't worried about it, are we, Jewel?

868
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:46,688
Hey, Ken. You know what I'd do if I were you?

869
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:50,522
- No. What?
- I'd take me a walk. It's good for the nerves.

870
01:16:50,611 --> 01:16:54,062
Maybe you'll hear the nice things
people are saying about your driving.

871
01:16:54,156 --> 01:16:56,825
That might do me some good.

872
01:16:58,994 --> 01:17:02,659
Rob, if Ken loses,
what about the partnership?

873
01:17:03,498 --> 01:17:09,371
No. Not until the mare pays for herself.
That was the deal.

874
01:17:09,463 --> 01:17:13,626
If you're back in the game to stay, Beaver,
I'll put some horses in your stable.

875
01:17:13,717 --> 01:17:15,674
I'll be proud to have 'em.

876
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:19,296
I never expected to see old Sundown
trotting like that again.

877
01:17:19,389 --> 01:17:22,841
Well, it's Sundown's legs,
but my hands and my head.

878
01:17:22,935 --> 01:17:24,808
Carey.

879
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:31,693
Now, that McLaughlin boy has got a mare
with speed to burn, but he ain't gonna win.

880
01:17:31,777 --> 01:17:36,320
Cos he ain't got it here nor here.
Has he, Sundown, huh?

881
01:17:36,406 --> 01:17:38,897
- Relish?
- No, thank you.

882
01:17:40,911 --> 01:17:44,695
- Guess your grandpa figures on this heat too.
- He's out to win.

883
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:48,538
- So am I.
- It was awful watching that heat.

884
01:17:48,627 --> 01:17:51,628
Oh, Ken. If only the both of you could win.

885
01:17:51,713 --> 01:17:55,379
Yeah, I know. I'm kinda all mixed-up too.

886
01:17:55,467 --> 01:18:00,509
I want Jewel to win, but I hate to think what
it might do to your grandfather if he loses.

887
01:18:00,597 --> 01:18:03,302
He hasn't touched a drop since the dance.

888
01:18:03,392 --> 01:18:06,013
That's just what I mean.

889
01:18:06,103 --> 01:18:10,599
Well, someone's got to win.
And if it isn't Grandpa, I hope it's you.

890
01:18:10,691 --> 01:18:13,395
Good luck to both of us.

891
01:18:13,485 --> 01:18:18,361
<i>(PA) Get up there. Get ready. Gentlemen,
trail them down the path at 80 yards now.</i>

892
01:18:18,448 --> 01:18:24,035
Get them together this time. McLaughlin, get
your mare over there a little quicker, please.

893
01:18:24,121 --> 01:18:27,287
- Into your position. You're in third position.
<i>- (Whinnies)</i>

894
01:18:27,374 --> 01:18:29,912
<i>Up a little farther. Now let's all turn.</i>

895
01:18:30,002 --> 01:18:31,745
<i>Easy.</i>

896
01:18:31,837 --> 01:18:33,995
<i>Be careful now.</i>

897
01:18:34,089 --> 01:18:36,580
<i>Wait for them in front. Wait, McLaughlin.</i>

898
01:18:36,675 --> 01:18:41,052
<i>Not too fast, McLaughlin.
Not too fast. Let them come.</i>

899
01:18:41,138 --> 01:18:42,169
<i>Go!</i>

900
01:18:45,309 --> 01:18:47,385
<i>Crown Jewel on top.</i>

901
01:18:47,477 --> 01:18:51,261
<i>McLaughlin's setting a very fast pace
with his mare around the turn.</i>

902
01:18:51,356 --> 01:18:56,268
<i>Then it's Dillola Lord in second.
Donald Ford is third. Sundown in fifth.</i>

903
01:18:56,361 --> 01:18:59,031
<i>Still Crown Jewel on top.</i>

904
01:18:59,114 --> 01:19:03,242
He's pushing her too hard.
Take a breather, Ken! Take a breather!

905
01:19:03,327 --> 01:19:05,652
<i>He'll take his mare back to save her.</i>

906
01:19:05,746 --> 01:19:07,785
You'll burn her out at that clip.

907
01:19:08,916 --> 01:19:15,333
<i>It's Dillola Lord, Donald Ford, and
Crown Jewel is dropping back now to third.</i>

908
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:18,791
<i>It's Dillola Lord,
Donald Ford, Crown Jewel...</i>

909
01:19:18,884 --> 01:19:21,636
- Take it easy, Kenny!
- Come on, Grandpa!

910
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:25,171
<i>Still Dillola Lord on top.
Donald Ford is second.</i>

911
01:19:25,265 --> 01:19:30,058
<i>Mr McLaughlin makes a drive with his mare
and Greenway makes a drive with Sundown.</i>

912
01:19:30,145 --> 01:19:35,187
<i>They're still moving up that back lane,
and now Crown Jewel comes to the top again,</i>

913
01:19:35,275 --> 01:19:39,688
<i>followed by Miss Bosise moving up
on the outside. Here's a new one in here.</i>

914
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:43,065
<i>It's Miss Bosise moving up
to the side of Crown Jewel.</i>

915
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,323
We got you now, greenhorn!

916
01:19:46,203 --> 01:19:51,909
<i>Now Miss Bosise is going to the top.
Crown Jewel is still second, Sundown is third.</i>

917
01:19:54,002 --> 01:19:55,960
- Is it Grandpa?
- No, it's No.6.

918
01:19:56,046 --> 01:19:58,169
<i>Dunwiddy is coming out of that wreck.</i>

919
01:19:58,257 --> 01:20:01,507
- Is he all right?
- He's all right. He's on his feet.

920
01:20:01,593 --> 01:20:06,006
<i>Dillola Lord is third. Around that turn now,
and it's still Crown Jewel.</i>

921
01:20:06,098 --> 01:20:10,178
<i>Looking back to see how close Sundown is.
He's right on his wheel now.</i>

922
01:20:10,269 --> 01:20:12,261
Grandpa'll make his move now. Watch.

923
01:20:12,354 --> 01:20:14,845
<i>Here they are.
It's Crown Jewel. It's Sundown.</i>

924
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:16,315
Sundown!

925
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:20,611
<i>Crown Jewel is still on top.
Sundown moving up on even terms with her.</i>

926
01:20:20,696 --> 01:20:23,899
- Here he comes. I told you!
- Come on, Ken!

927
01:20:23,991 --> 01:20:26,114
Come on, Kenny! Come on, Kenny!

928
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:29,692
<i>It's Sundown
who's got the slight advantage.</i>

929
01:20:29,788 --> 01:20:31,864
Watch it, Ken.

930
01:20:31,957 --> 01:20:36,952
<i>...like a pair again. And what a race it's
going to be. It's Crown Jewel with Sundown.</i>

931
01:20:37,045 --> 01:20:38,623
Come on, Kenny.

932
01:20:38,714 --> 01:20:41,335
<i>...and neck to neck. And what a finish...</i>

933
01:20:41,425 --> 01:20:43,049
Come on, Sundown!

934
01:20:43,135 --> 01:20:46,338
<i>There's Crown Jewel on the inside
and Sundown on the outside.</i>

935
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:49,514
Now's the time, Kenny!
Now's the time. Turn her loose!

936
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,723
<i>Now Crown Jewel moves away.</i>

937
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:53,602
He's making his move!

938
01:20:53,687 --> 01:20:55,763
Come on, Grandpa!

939
01:20:56,315 --> 01:21:00,359
<i>It's Sundown almost on her wheel again.</i>

940
01:21:00,444 --> 01:21:06,149
<i>It's Crown Jewel out to a slight advantage.
And here she is. Crown Jewel, the winner!</i>

941
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:08,234
<i>(neighs)</i>

942
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:14,446
Whoo-hoo! That's our boy!

943
01:21:14,541 --> 01:21:18,290
- Ken was wonderful!
- Come on. Let's go see him.

944
01:21:20,547 --> 01:21:22,919
You tried, Sundown.

945
01:21:23,008 --> 01:21:25,084
So did I.

946
01:21:26,136 --> 01:21:28,710
It's not good enough.

947
01:21:32,851 --> 01:21:36,600
This heat'll be the tough one,
so keep your eyes and your ears open.

948
01:21:36,688 --> 01:21:39,606
Old Beaver knows a lot of tricks
you never even heard of.

949
01:21:39,691 --> 01:21:43,903
- He'll probably use every last one of them...
<i>- (Man)</i> Five minutes!

950
01:21:43,987 --> 01:21:49,148
Get your horses ready for the class-14 trot!
Get your horses ready...

951
01:21:49,243 --> 01:21:51,947
<i>(man ♪2)</i> We'll be ready, boss.

952
01:22:01,338 --> 01:22:07,092
- What are you looking for, Grandpa?
- Oh, I thought I'd put a shadow roll on him.

953
01:22:07,177 --> 01:22:11,969
- But why?
- Well, he kind of shied the last time.

954
01:22:12,057 --> 01:22:16,351
Sundown doesn't need
a shadow roll to win, Grandpa.

955
01:22:16,436 --> 01:22:19,556
And you don't need anything either.

956
01:22:22,651 --> 01:22:25,189
<i>In this third heat of the Governor's Stake,</i>

957
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:29,572
<i>you're going to see some keen competition
between these two heat winners.</i>

958
01:22:31,159 --> 01:22:35,821
Dr Parshall, you know where to take that
horse. Around the rail and come down slow.

959
01:22:35,914 --> 01:22:38,370
<i>McLaughlin, try to get your mare rounded out.</i>

960
01:22:38,458 --> 01:22:42,919
<i>You boys are not obeying the rules very well.
You know what to do with them.</i>

961
01:22:43,005 --> 01:22:46,255
<i>Parshall, turn slow.
McLaughlin, in there where you belong.</i>

962
01:22:46,341 --> 01:22:48,797
- Ken's too anxious.
- Easy, son. Easy.

963
01:22:49,761 --> 01:22:51,421
This is the heat that counts.

964
01:22:51,513 --> 01:22:55,677
<i>Everybody be careful. Watch your horse
at the rail. Don't try to beat him away.</i>

965
01:22:55,767 --> 01:22:58,305
<i>Easy now. Let's get these horses on the stride.</i>

966
01:22:58,395 --> 01:23:04,765
Everybody on the trot now. That's very nice.
Not too fast. Not too fast. Go!

967
01:23:09,823 --> 01:23:12,492
Crown Jewel is now on the stride again.

968
01:23:12,576 --> 01:23:16,194
It's still Dillola Lord,
and Miss Bosise on the outside is second.

969
01:23:16,288 --> 01:23:20,499
<i>Donald Ford is third and Crown Jewel
is fourth. And Sundown is fifth.</i>

970
01:23:20,584 --> 01:23:22,375
<i>(whinnies)</i>

971
01:23:22,461 --> 01:23:26,245
<i>Around that turn,
it's still Dillola Lord, it's Donald Ford,</i>

972
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:29,625
<i>and it's now Miss Bosise third.</i>

973
01:23:29,718 --> 01:23:31,794
<i>Crown Jewel and Sundown.</i>

974
01:23:31,887 --> 01:23:36,964
<i>Now it's still Dillola Lord. Crown Jewel
moving up to second position on the outside.</i>

975
01:23:37,059 --> 01:23:40,926
<i>Donald Ford third and it's Sundown fourth.
It's still Dillola Lord.</i>

976
01:23:42,481 --> 01:23:46,692
Get away! Don't put them in front of me!
Come on, Kenny!

977
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:49,776
<i>It's still Dillola Lord,</i>

978
01:23:49,863 --> 01:23:52,188
<i>Crown Jewel, Sundown.</i>

979
01:23:52,282 --> 01:23:56,150
<i>They're all going that short route now,
biding their time to make their drive.</i>

980
01:23:56,245 --> 01:24:00,741
<i>Greenway is making an effort
to get his horse in a better position now.</i>

981
01:24:00,832 --> 01:24:05,411
<i>Still Dillola Lord and Crown Jewel. Greenway
has his horse right on McLaughlin's back.</i>

982
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:09,003
Look at Sundown.
Beaver's got him breathing down Ken's neck.

983
01:24:09,091 --> 01:24:13,669
<i>Sundown is right on his back again.
Still going that short route.</i>

984
01:24:13,762 --> 01:24:15,968
He knows all the tricks. Come on, Kenny.

985
01:24:16,056 --> 01:24:21,051
<i>Dillola Lord still on top. Crown Jewel
is still second and Sundown is third.</i>

986
01:24:21,144 --> 01:24:22,603
Come on, girl. Let's go.

987
01:24:22,688 --> 01:24:28,026
<i>McLaughlin makes his drive. He's coming
through. Crown Jewel passes Dillola Lord...</i>

988
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:31,194
- That's the boy, Kenny!
<i>- (Whinnies)</i>

989
01:24:32,114 --> 01:24:36,610
<i>It's now Crown Jewel.
Sundown is second. Dillola Lord is third.</i>

990
01:24:36,702 --> 01:24:38,990
<i>Crown Jewel out now by an open length.</i>

991
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:42,033
<i>Sundown is moving on the outside very fast.</i>

992
01:24:42,124 --> 01:24:45,374
<i>Now Sundown is up to her wheel.
It's still Crown Jewel.</i>

993
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:47,334
Come on, Sundown.

994
01:24:47,421 --> 01:24:52,462
<i>...trotting as a pair,
it's Crown Jewel and Sundown.</i>

995
01:24:52,551 --> 01:24:54,342
Come on, Sundown!

996
01:24:54,428 --> 01:24:57,345
<i>Still trotting very fast on the outside now.</i>

997
01:24:57,431 --> 01:24:58,676
Come on, Kenny.

998
01:24:58,765 --> 01:25:01,636
<i>It's Crown Jewel and Sundown
racing as a pair.</i>

999
01:25:01,727 --> 01:25:04,052
<i>Crown Jewel pulls away a little bit...</i>

1000
01:25:04,146 --> 01:25:05,177
Go on, Sundown!

1001
01:25:05,272 --> 01:25:09,020
<i>Sundown is trying very hard
to improve his position here. Oh!</i>

1002
01:25:09,109 --> 01:25:11,315
<i>Crown Jewel makes a break.</i>

1003
01:25:12,362 --> 01:25:14,735
She's broken!

1004
01:25:14,823 --> 01:25:19,865
<i>Sundown is trotting very fast on the outside.
Moving up slowly, he goes to the top.</i>

1005
01:25:19,953 --> 01:25:24,414
<i>Crown Jewel is still on the rail. McLaughlin
finding it hard to get her on the stride.</i>

1006
01:25:26,251 --> 01:25:29,952
<i>On the outside and going very fast...
Here he is - Sundown, the winner!</i>

1007
01:25:30,047 --> 01:25:31,209
<i>(neighs)</i>

1008
01:25:31,298 --> 01:25:35,212
It's... it's Grandpa! It's Grandpa! It's Grandpa!

1009
01:25:35,302 --> 01:25:37,758
He's won! He's won! Oh, he's won!

1010
01:25:39,556 --> 01:25:41,679
I'm sorry about Ken.

1011
01:25:41,767 --> 01:25:45,100
Oh, he's won. Isn't that wonderful? Oh!

1012
01:25:45,187 --> 01:25:47,856
Looks like we brought up the rear
that time, boy.

1013
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:50,857
Here is the winner
of the third heat and the race,

1014
01:25:50,943 --> 01:25:53,481
the Governor's Stake for 14-class trotters -

1015
01:25:53,570 --> 01:25:57,615
Sundown, owned and driven
by Beaver Greenway.

1016
01:26:03,789 --> 01:26:07,656
- What happened to her, Ken?
- I don't know. She just quit.

1017
01:26:07,751 --> 01:26:09,957
<i>(whinnies softly)</i>

1018
01:26:10,045 --> 01:26:12,251
Yeah.

1019
01:26:18,679 --> 01:26:23,839
And it gives me great pleasure to welcome
Beaver Greenway back to the harness game

1020
01:26:23,934 --> 01:26:27,469
by awarding him the trophy
for having won the Governor's Stake.

1021
01:26:27,563 --> 01:26:29,140
Thank you, sir.

1022

<i>(band plays "The Camptown Races")</i>

1023
01:26:35,112 --> 01:26:39,857
- Mr Greenway, what made Crown Jewel quit?
- Quit? A horse like her don't quit.

1024
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:43,782
- You won, Grandpa. You won. You won.
- I'll get a shot of that, please.

1025
01:26:43,871 --> 01:26:46,741
Hop on, ducky. All right.

1026
01:27:01,346 --> 01:27:05,724
- What happened to her, Rob?
- As far as I can see, there's nothing wrong.

1027
01:27:05,809 --> 01:27:09,677
She didn't stop going just to let me win.
You drove a great race, son.

1028
01:27:09,771 --> 01:27:10,803
Thank you, sir.

1029
01:27:10,898 --> 01:27:14,397
It wasn't your fault she didn't win.
You were as good as Grandpa.

1030
01:27:14,484 --> 01:27:16,892
- Honest?
- Shh!

1031
01:27:23,702 --> 01:27:25,908
<i>(laughs)</i>

1032
01:27:25,996 --> 01:27:30,290
- What are you laughing at?
- Well, by ginger, I might have known it.

1033
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:34,159
- You're a great horseman, Rob, and you, Ken.
- What do you mean?

1034
01:27:34,254 --> 01:27:38,833
This is one for the book. Unless I'm mistaken,
this young lady's going to be a mother.

1035
01:27:38,926 --> 01:27:39,874
<i>(laughter)</i>

1036
01:27:39,968 --> 01:27:42,542
- A what?
<i>- (Neighing)</i>

1037
01:27:43,263 --> 01:27:46,217
<i>(Gus)</i> Stop bragging. Stop bragging.

1038
01:27:46,308 --> 01:27:47,553
Thunderhead.

1039
01:27:47,643 --> 01:27:51,937
Of course. Listen, he's giving you
the horse laugh now.

1040
01:27:54,024 --> 01:27:57,358
- A colt by Thunderhead.
- That's better than winning the race.

1041
01:28:00,697 --> 01:28:02,322
He's Thunderhead all over.

1042
01:28:02,407 --> 01:28:05,361
His eyes are
his great grandfather's - the Albino.

1043
01:28:05,452 --> 01:28:09,580
- He's got something to live up to.
- He will. He'll be the greatest of them all.

1044
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:11,665
<i>(neighs)</i>

1045
01:28:13,836 --> 01:28:16,457
Run along, Storm Cloud. Papa's calling.

1046
01:28:16,547 --> 01:28:21,789
<i>(Gus) ♪ To the world

1048

THE END
