1
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,430
"Unauthorized Cinnamon"

2
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,020
He's gone up with your son

3
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,960
Wants notice when you're ready to serve

4
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,100
I knocked holes in these walls

5
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,320
Confinement gives me the fidgets

6
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,890
Set yourself up comfortable

7
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,680
Let me confide as well, Odell,

8
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,150
that when people only say to me with other words what I have just said to them,

9
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,830
I quickly grow impatient

10
00:01:58,225 --> 00:01:58,811
All right, Sir

11
00:01:59,432 --> 00:01:59,941
Tell me about the gold
 
12
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,924
I will, Sir…

13
00:02:02,303 --> 00:02:05,049
what little I know to say, hoping you will learn me the rest

14
00:02:06,296 --> 00:02:08,923
This is what they call an assay and metallurgist report

15
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:10,333
Yes, I've heard of those

16
00:02:11,468 --> 00:02:12,801
Sit down, boy. Sit down

17
00:02:16,126 --> 00:02:19,713
"Third Baptist Congregation, Monrovia Settlement"

18
00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:21,840
The congregation has title to the find

19
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:23,663
And how are you connected to the congregation?

20
00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:26,362
Odell : I'm First Deacon , Sir 
Hearst : I see

21
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:27,152
Congratulations

22
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,202
Being you were known to me through my mama's letters,

23
00:02:29,748 --> 00:02:32,283
Odell : when the proposals started to come to us-- 
Hearst : Proposals?

24
00:02:32,715 --> 00:02:33,873
The different English proposals

25
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:35,150
From Great Britain, you mean?

26
00:02:35,896 --> 00:02:37,350
To develop the find, yes, Sir

27
00:02:38,588 --> 00:02:40,652
I was sent to ask if you'd guide us

28
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:44,463
Does your congregation conceive some sort of a partnership, Odell?

29
00:02:45,118 --> 00:02:46,333
However you thought we should do

30
00:02:46,695 --> 00:02:49,113
I do take in partners with the understanding that

31
00:02:49,885 --> 00:02:52,412
in dealing with the color, mine is the deciding voice

32
00:02:52,785 --> 00:02:53,773
Dealing with the color, Sir?

33
00:02:54,046 --> 00:02:54,463
The gold

34
00:02:55,018 --> 00:02:57,000
securing and exploiting the gold

35
00:02:58,718 --> 00:03:00,342
Do you want to see the gold now, Sir?

36
00:03:00,635 --> 00:03:01,700
Do you want to show it to me?

37
00:03:01,945 --> 00:03:03,453
They give it to me to show you, Sir

38
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,250
Suppose we oughtn't

39
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:07,800
let the congregation down

40
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,710
I can't imagine your mother's not nearly prepared our supper

41
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:25,113
What do you think of the gold?

42
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:26,941
It makes me hungry, Odell

43
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:29,560
Harry should be at the meeting

44
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:30,791
I ain't saying he shouldn't

45
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:32,661
I wasn't told to invite him

46
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:35,230
Candidate for public office

47
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:39,122
Please convey to Al that short of being forbidden,

48
00:03:39,437 --> 00:03:41,020
I intend to bring Harry with me

49
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:42,633
I'll convey that word for word

50
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:45,120
And what would be my position?

51
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:48,103
Oughtn't I attend as the livery's new owner?

52
00:03:48,368 --> 00:03:49,500
Hostetler never attended

53
00:03:49,778 --> 00:03:53,612
Prior to blowing off his fucking head, Hostetler was a nigger

54
00:03:54,298 --> 00:03:56,150
Last I looked I'm white!

55
00:03:56,468 --> 00:03:59,081
True, as, uh, far as it goes

56
00:03:59,388 --> 00:04:02,231
I can abstain from attending if that closes the can of peas

57
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:08,081
Oh, uh uh, you are a candidate for public office with a chance to put the fire wagon on the table

58
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:12,590
If it's a question of room, shove two fucking tables together!

59
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:15,160
Room is not the issue, Steve,

60
00:04:15,597 --> 00:04:17,553
if you have to see my down card

61
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:23,893
I do not vouch for you, nor presume to bring you uninvited, as I do Harry,

62
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:26,751
because you are not the same quality person

63
00:04:27,907 --> 00:04:33,871
Meaning I'm not fanatic for fucking fire wagons like Harry and all the other five-year-olds

64
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:36,251
Anyways I've still got the doc to invite

65
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:37,722
Is this the quickest way to the cabin here

66
00:04:37,757 --> 00:04:40,903
Tell Al add and extra peach dish

67
00:04:41,997 --> 00:04:44,621
Can you certify the purity of your blood, Steve?

68
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:47,701
I only ask because your nose is…

69
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:49,143
broad

70
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:53,501
Take your apron off, and consider changing your shirt,

71
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:56,702
which I fucking suggested yesterday

72
00:05:13,588 --> 00:05:16,531
Will you mind very much if we have our dinner quickly?

73
00:05:26,688 --> 00:05:28,080
Camp business, Dear?

74
00:05:34,947 --> 00:05:37,983
Come to cases. I will get sent to hire guns

75
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,420
quick time,

76
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:44,220
bouncing in the fucking saddle and howling at every Goddamn hoof-fall,

77
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,380
I put out cinnamon

78
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:48,883
Where?

79
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:50,621
The meeting table

80
00:05:51,157 --> 00:05:52,212
On whose instruction?

81
00:05:52,338 --> 00:05:54,340
Cinnamon's good with peaches

82
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:57,882
Do not put unauthorized cinnamon on the Goddamn meetin' table

83
00:05:59,516 --> 00:06:00,520
That's all the fuck we need

84
00:06:00,638 --> 00:06:02,413
It's available as a choice

85
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:04,642
Which is not your province to offer, Jewel

86
00:06:04,937 --> 00:06:08,451
Well, if food's not my province, then you can make your own fucking breakfast

87
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:13,301
I had best not come out of this Goddamn kitchen and find Goddamn cinnamon on the fucking meeting table!

88
00:06:19,737 --> 00:06:23,723
Leg up to Cheyenne by now, I'd be heading there in a civilized fucking gait

89
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:35,723
Doc!  Johnny Burns, Doc!

90
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:39,410
You remember you, you come to that

91
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:43,733
that meeting before to set the pest tent up and the like?

92
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:46,293
And E.B. was made Mayor?

93
00:06:52,868 --> 00:06:53,662
Hey, Doc

94
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:56,870
You can't talk?

95
00:06:57,946 --> 00:06:59,632
Anyway, Al's got another one of them meetings

96
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:02,250
You can't come?

97
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:10,281
Jesus, Doc

98
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:12,263
All right, all right I'll tell him

99
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:13,170
you can't come

100
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:15,860
Anyway, look, I hope--I hope you feel better

101
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:45,383
My best efforts, Odell,

102
00:07:45,746 --> 00:07:50,073
do not yet persuade your mother to be indifferent to the opinions of others

103
00:07:50,616 --> 00:07:54,010
If it's all right with you, Mr. Hearst, it's all all right with me

104
00:07:54,548 --> 00:07:55,550
This looks wonderful, Mama

105
00:07:55,855 --> 00:07:56,371
Thank you

106
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:11,513
I suppose you've told your mama about being First Deacon of your congregation in Liberia

107
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:14,332
I haven't yet had the chance to give her the news

108
00:08:14,585 --> 00:08:17,170
Does your congregation have no strictures, Odell,

109
00:08:17,646 --> 00:08:19,310
against its Deacon drinking?

110
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:20,732
It does, yes, Sir

111
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:22,552
Yet the smell of liquor's on your breath

112
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,351
Do I mistake?

113
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:28,303
No, Sir, Mr. Hearst, you don't

114
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:31,043
Did you have one drink of liquor, Odell,

115
00:08:31,398 --> 00:08:32,893
from nervousness about our talk?

116
00:08:33,315 --> 00:08:34,493
I admit I did, Sir, yes

117
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:36,771
Did you drink on the ship from Liberia?

118
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,801
No, Sir

119
00:08:38,178 --> 00:08:39,943
Or coming overland from New York?

120
00:08:40,338 --> 00:08:41,150
No, Sir, Mr. Hearst

121
00:08:41,428 --> 00:08:44,422
Would  the liquor I smell then be the first you've ever consumed?

122
00:08:48,387 --> 00:08:49,713
I've had some before, Sir

123
00:08:49,955 --> 00:08:54,831
Prior to becoming Deacon of the Third Baptist of Monrovia or after?

124
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:57,232
I guess a little of both

125
00:08:57,326 --> 00:09:02,341
Showing gold thousands of miles from its purported source to authenticate a find,

126
00:09:02,578 --> 00:09:06,043
I would associate less with our savior's qualities of character,

127
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:09,752
than Adam's, or someone pretending to his innocence

128
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,541
Before he met the serpent

129
00:09:13,297 --> 00:09:13,883
Hmm

130
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:17,821
The combative note in that pleases me, Odell,

131
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:24,620
as against what till now has seemed haphazard and sloven and slipshod

132
00:09:24,975 --> 00:09:26,940
in your approach to fleecing me

133
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:31,192
My mistake was thinking that you'd want your niggers praising Jesus

134
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,553
What the hell are we talking about this for?

135
00:09:34,936 --> 00:09:36,433
Did the assay make sense or not?

136
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:41,793
Ten dollars'll buy a report that proves a find of pure ore in your ass, Odell

137
00:09:42,377 --> 00:09:45,230
I guess that's why I didn't figure till you'd had someone over there,

138
00:09:45,528 --> 00:09:46,652
we'd be drawing up any papers

139
00:09:47,265 --> 00:09:50,320
Figured this'd be a getting-to-know-each-other conversation,

140
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:52,241
seeing if we'd want to go any further

141
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,220
Far as I'm concerned, we don't

142
00:09:54,757 --> 00:09:55,450
Calm down

143
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:58,132
Now just calm down, son

144
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,541
If I have mistook you in some regard,

145
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,474
you'll find I'm man enough to apologize

146
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:10,819
Now,

147
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:14,423
just sit down, we'll finish our meal,

148
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:19,523
and then maybe afterwards we'll take in the camp and,

149
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:23,951
if you have any vices beyond your drinking, I might even offer you a cigar

150
00:10:39,108 --> 00:10:39,941
How's he doing?

151
00:10:40,578 --> 00:10:42,032
Holding his fucking own

152
00:10:48,146 --> 00:10:53,452
…Then I asked, "What good am I to myself or the camp standing sentinel over a coffee pot?"

153
00:10:54,568 --> 00:10:55,750
Was why I cam home

154
00:10:58,508 --> 00:10:59,880
I wish you wouldn't smoke in here

155
00:11:00,155 --> 00:11:02,551
I wish, when asleep, you wouldn't snore and fucking fart

156
00:11:02,826 --> 00:11:05,302
I have no choice about either of those

157
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:10,363
If I extinguish this fucking cigarette, it'll be in the middle of your fucking forehead

158
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:12,202
Ah

159
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,522
I'm glad she fucking fired me

160
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:17,020
I hate that fucking bank

161
00:11:17,488 --> 00:11:21,150
It's the context, I think, that disturbs you, that she's back to using dope

162
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:23,970
Yes yes! That she's back on the dope disturbs me

163
00:11:24,576 --> 00:11:29,383
And why, even as we speak, your own life hangs by a fucking thread

164
00:11:43,555 --> 00:11:45,033
What's to become of that child?

165
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,340
Johnny Burns, Mr. Star!

166
00:11:48,378 --> 00:11:49,231
What is it?

167
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,192
Well, Al's called a meeting like the ones you've come to before

168
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:53,883
Does Sheriff Bullock know?

169
00:11:54,128 --> 00:11:56,240
Well, seemed to me they halfway called it together

170
00:11:57,465 --> 00:11:57,961
All right, I'm coming

171
00:11:58,257 --> 00:12:00,111
Uh, if you ain't get dessert yet,

172
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:01,232
don't

173
00:12:01,677 --> 00:12:02,333
All right

174
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:04,181
Al's broke out the canned peaches

175
00:12:05,655 --> 00:12:06,361
All right

176
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,512
The Bullock's could take her

177
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:17,831
Or we could

178
00:12:26,715 --> 00:12:28,551
You'd have us care for a child?

179
00:12:38,646 --> 00:12:41,870
Now more than previously, Sofia, Mr. Ellsworth will

180
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,802
spend time at the diggings

181
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:48,611
Did he not come home last night?

182
00:12:51,586 --> 00:12:52,883
I'm not sure, Darling

183
00:12:55,216 --> 00:12:56,340
Possibly he did not

184
00:12:58,576 --> 00:13:00,120
And maybe that's why you didn't waken

185
00:13:00,436 --> 00:13:01,681
I didn't feel his beard

186
00:13:04,957 --> 00:13:06,083
Possibly that's why

187
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:11,511
But he will be seeing you

188
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:24,611
And everything will be all right

189
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:32,453
I gave him a foolproof fucking approach to wind up with that woman's claim,

190
00:13:32,506 --> 00:13:34,710
and I could have been shit drawing flies

191
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:38,653
Hearst is that fucking focused on Bullock pulling his ear

192
00:13:39,598 --> 00:13:40,242
Yeah

193
00:13:42,026 --> 00:13:43,392
All collected but Doc

194
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:44,391
Where the fuck is he?

195
00:13:44,695 --> 00:13:45,713
He ain't up to it, he says

196
00:13:47,856 --> 00:13:49,512
Uh,  cinnamon's out for the peaches

197
00:13:49,776 --> 00:13:50,093
Huh?

198
00:13:50,586 --> 00:13:51,630
That wasn't my fucking doing

199
00:13:52,617 --> 00:13:55,570
Giving Hearst, Bullock is the only move that don't end with the camp in flames

200
00:13:56,527 --> 00:13:58,833
And that one only gets us up to 50-50

201
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:11,391
It sounds as if Cochran's turned face to the wall

202
00:14:11,855 --> 00:14:12,921
His fucking lungs

203
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,631
There's quite a falling off among the other sawbones in camp

204
00:14:17,236 --> 00:14:20,240
We  might put notice in the eastern papers

205
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:22,581
Once we've ceased our weeping

206
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:30,170
Had he known our might and guile,

207
00:14:30,665 --> 00:14:32,290
Hearst would have never left the Comstock

208
00:14:32,577 --> 00:14:35,153
Earnie, you got credit for a free tug tomorrow. Let's go

209
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:37,300
I'll spank it myself

210
00:14:37,696 --> 00:14:38,552
Just watch me

211
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,971
You'll spank it in front of a Goddamn mule team

212
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:43,671
Sirs, if I might explain

213
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:48,312
In my vision, I leapt from the coach and straight come to see him

214
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,303
Al's got a meeting tonight, Gustave

215
00:14:50,685 --> 00:14:51,930
You can tell him your vision tomorrow

216
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,451
Mr. Swearengen!

217
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:56,962
It's just as I imagined!

218
00:14:58,235 --> 00:15:00,682
I have something so important to give to you

219
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:02,031
What?

220
00:15:02,558 --> 00:15:03,352
You mustn't ask me what

221
00:15:03,787 --> 00:15:04,933
And you mustn't ask me why

222
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:06,441
You must go fuck yourself

223
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:12,232
And don't speak disgusting to me or answer for Mr. Swearengen what is a very important answer

224
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:15,073
Let me know when Bullock arrives

225
00:15:16,786 --> 00:15:17,200
Ah

226
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,792
Oh, Tom Nuttall's coming and he's bringing Harry Manning

227
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:22,653
Bullock!

228
00:15:28,837 --> 00:15:33,103
Guess if you've got a pussy, even owning a bank don't get you to that table

229
00:15:39,517 --> 00:15:42,540
Jesus Christ, easy easy easy easy

230
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:44,251
There'll be conversations left and right

231
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:48,093
Don't get too far up there on the fucking wrist

232
00:15:48,236 --> 00:15:49,203
Do you want to use the sponge?

233
00:15:49,436 --> 00:15:50,660
That's not the fucking point

234
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:56,662
You just not be starting length and breadth conversations throughout the fucking camp or territory or so on

235
00:15:57,325 --> 00:16:02,872
Or do I suppose now I take off my fucking undershirt or the like and show my tits and so forth !?

236
00:16:02,477 --> 00:16:03,483
I'll leave you to wash that part

237
00:16:04,686 --> 00:16:07,363
Who the fuck am I fucking kidding or putting on airs in front of?

238
00:16:08,117 --> 00:16:10,371
I been disrobed in front of every…

239
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:15,340
barnyard creature that hunts or pecks or rolls in the fucking mud

240
00:16:15,797 --> 00:16:21,463
Who the fuck should I have shyness before or pride or the like, for Christ's sake?

241
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:22,961
What difference does it make?

242
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,352
What the fuck do I have to be ashamed of at this late fucking date?

243
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:28,302
Who cares anyway?!

244
00:16:32,137 --> 00:16:36,621
Now go ahead and sponge my fucking tits and get it over with if that's what you fucking do

245
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:37,901
It's nothing like that, Jane

246
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:39,090
Well, what's it like then

247
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:40,253
I never had a sister

248
00:16:41,646 --> 00:16:42,570
I had two

249
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,940
And I slept with both of 'em

250
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:50,610
I don't know why God let me or…

251
00:16:52,398 --> 00:16:54,470
if he forgives me when I pray, but

252
00:16:55,726 --> 00:16:57,203
but I'd never hurt you, Jane,

253
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,262
or touch you if you didn't want

254
00:17:03,245 --> 00:17:04,081
I believe that

255
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:07,110
But I don't want to open my eyes

256
00:17:07,836 --> 00:17:11,060
But you can go ahead and kiss me if that's what you fucking do

257
00:17:29,985 --> 00:17:33,483
What possesses me to buy all of these swatches?

258
00:17:33,978 --> 00:17:35,920
Even though I have no reason why I should!

259
00:17:36,536 --> 00:17:40,653
Because who back at that camp would wear suits of such colors?

260
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:44,551
But I have learned sometimes if you have a thing,

261
00:17:45,227 --> 00:17:47,550
the  reason for the thing is that you have it!

262
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:51,433
And when I am in New York City, I have a letter from a friend

263
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:53,751
In the news from the camp, he says,

264
00:17:54,215 --> 00:18:00,241
And Mr. Swearengen has lost the top part of his middle finger to an accident some kind"

265
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:06,751
And I say, "I will take these swatches to Mr. Swearengen," And,

266
00:18:07,246 --> 00:18:12,702
"I like the look of his vest when he is out in the morning, out on the balcony,

267
00:18:12,986 --> 00:18:17,922
drinking his coffee, and he is very much a handsome man at those times,

268
00:18:18,288 --> 00:18:20,762
and maybe he would like one for his stump

269
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:22,392
Or maybe more

270
00:18:23,248 --> 00:18:25,292
a different swatch for every day, why not?"

271
00:18:26,535 --> 00:18:27,371
Give me your stump

272
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:28,911
Don't think about it. Just give it to me

273
00:18:31,537 --> 00:18:36,092
Now this corner of the swatch we pretend is the lost child

274
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:44,453
The little boy goes up the mountain, around the bend, always looking for mama

275
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:46,493
And where does he finally find her?

276
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:48,541
Where?

277
00:18:49,188 --> 00:18:50,811
Here she is! Here's mama!

278
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:56,031
Wrapping herself around you tight tight tight

279
00:18:56,515 --> 00:18:59,372
Mama's got you little Al Everything's all right!

280
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:07,893
I like that color very very much

281
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:09,972
Do you?

282
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,621
Please God, come in

283
00:19:15,578 --> 00:19:16,193
Bullock

284
00:19:17,746 --> 00:19:18,903
Thank you, Gustave

285
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:19,840
Please leave

286
00:19:30,028 --> 00:19:32,233
Before the color, no white man

287
00:19:33,366 --> 00:19:38,830
no man of any hue moved to civilize or improve a place like this had reason to make the effort

288
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:45,573
The color brought commerce here, and such order as has been attained

289
00:19:46,338 --> 00:19:47,002
Yes, sir

290
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:49,840
Do you want to help Liberia, Odell?

291
00:19:50,576 --> 00:19:51,672
I want to help myself

292
00:19:52,615 --> 00:19:55,791
If Liberia is where my chance is, it's all right with me

293
00:19:56,997 --> 00:19:58,553
Gold is your chance

294
00:19:59,075 --> 00:19:59,783
Thank you, Sir

295
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,611
Gold is every man's opportunity

296
00:20:02,115 --> 00:20:03,361
Why do I make that argument?

297
00:20:04,317 --> 00:20:09,241
Because every defect in a man and in others' way of taking him,

298
00:20:10,068 --> 00:20:13,603
our agreement that gold has value gives us power to rise above

299
00:20:15,318 --> 00:20:18,560
Fond as you are of my mother, without that gold I showed you,

300
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:20,601
I don't expect we'd be out here talking

301
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:22,112
That is correct

302
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,823
And, for your effrontery at our meal a moment ago…

303
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:31,150
I'd have seen you shot or hanged without second thought

304
00:20:32,937 --> 00:20:37,181
The value I gave the gold restrained me, you see…

305
00:20:39,056 --> 00:20:42,032
your utility in connection to it

306
00:20:42,578 --> 00:20:43,973
And because of my gold,

307
00:20:44,296 --> 00:20:46,583
those at the other tables deferred to my restraint

308
00:20:48,966 --> 00:20:50,630
Gold confers power

309
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:53,980
Power comes to any man who has the color

310
00:20:54,925 --> 00:20:55,971
Even if he's black?

311
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:00,690
That is our species' hope:

312
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:06,571
That uniformly agreeing on its value, we organize to seek the color

313
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:14,092
Just before you and I met, Odell,

314
00:21:14,508 --> 00:21:18,243
the camp's Sheriff released me from a jail cell

315
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:20,330
That's hard for me to feature

316
00:21:20,888 --> 00:21:22,613
I hate these places, Odell,

317
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,450
because the truth that I know,

318
00:21:25,615 --> 00:21:27,302
the promise that I bring,

319
00:21:27,658 --> 00:21:30,901
the necessities I'm prepared to accept make me outcast

320
00:21:40,238 --> 00:21:41,141
Isn't that foolish?

321
00:21:43,275 --> 00:21:44,791
Isn't that foolishness?

322
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:55,910
And old man disabused long ago of certain yearnings and hopes as to how he would be held by his fellows,

323
00:21:57,718 --> 00:21:59,022
and yet I weep

324
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:04,061
Anyway, Sir,

325
00:22:05,678 --> 00:22:07,143
you want to send someone back with me?

326
00:22:07,597 --> 00:22:08,213
Yes, I do

327
00:22:10,965 --> 00:22:12,140
Yes, I do, son

328
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,012
I want to send you to help your people…

329
00:22:17,777 --> 00:22:20,313
and take this place down like Gomorrah

330
00:22:25,585 --> 00:22:29,842
All being affected, we might consider some facts as a group

331
00:22:30,756 --> 00:22:33,542
I arrested Hearst, acting in the name of the camp

332
00:22:33,837 --> 00:22:35,722
Without the camp's previous fucking say-so

333
00:22:36,187 --> 00:22:36,933
Do you propose that?

334
00:22:37,727 --> 00:22:39,541
Getting a say-so before I do my duty?

335
00:22:44,307 --> 00:22:45,300
Might be a good open

336
00:22:46,457 --> 00:22:47,831
showing Hearst it's off of him

337
00:22:48,028 --> 00:22:50,291
Bullock's tin won't placate Hearst

338
00:22:50,565 --> 00:22:51,810
Give it the fuck back to him

339
00:22:55,435 --> 00:22:57,112
Add  to your statement or shut the fuck up

340
00:22:57,267 --> 00:22:57,931
I'm done

341
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:00,582
Shall I, as Mayor

342
00:23:01,305 --> 00:23:04,272
initiate proceedings by giving my own opinions,

343
00:23:05,726 --> 00:23:11,992
however titular and insubstantial and merely honorific the position?

344
00:23:13,438 --> 00:23:16,203
Which argues against my doing so

345
00:23:17,376 --> 00:23:19,103
How is Hearst likely to answer?

346
00:23:19,978 --> 00:23:22,182
Ought steps to be taken in preemption?

347
00:23:23,147 --> 00:23:27,653
My instinct's to act alone, chart the course for fucking carnage

348
00:23:27,927 --> 00:23:32,691
That this would be general among 'em whose parents were so dim as to bring them

349
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:36,000
the fucking innocents is what give me fucking pause

350
00:23:38,277 --> 00:23:44,180
I invite the suggestions of others against my instinct to send for the guns

351
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:55,663
As I've expressed to the Sheriff and Mr. Star,

352
00:23:56,108 --> 00:24:00,180
and siding with your instincts, to protect the innocents,

353
00:24:00,485 --> 00:24:02,383
I'd send them from the camp

354
00:24:02,827 --> 00:24:09,371
Then fall on Hearst and his in their lair before they fall on us in ours

355
00:24:16,295 --> 00:24:19,222
As Wild Bill would have done

356
00:24:48,035 --> 00:24:48,892
This is a letter

357
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:53,381
Who's the fucking letter to? What the fuck is going on?

358
00:24:53,838 --> 00:24:55,331
Last of those Cornishmen murdered

359
00:24:55,586 --> 00:24:56,141
Pasco

360
00:24:56,446 --> 00:24:57,031
His family

361
00:24:58,028 --> 00:24:58,960
Read the letter

362
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:07,862
"It becomes my painful duty to inform you that Pasco Carwen was killed...

363
00:25:08,335 --> 00:25:10,343
Dan : Stop poking your head out 
Merrick : ...earlier this week

364
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:16,182
Jewel : I'm seeing who's using the cinnamon, and Harry Manning is using it plenty 
Merrick : His body was found in the road a short time after…."

365
00:25:16,576 --> 00:25:18,521
It was not mutilated in any way

366
00:25:19,658 --> 00:25:23,963
His death seems to have been instantaneous as he was stabbed through the heart

367
00:25:24,878 --> 00:25:32,910
Pasco's funeral occurred today and was attended by coworkers and friends who all shared the same high opinion of him

368
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:38,193
Everything was done by kind hands that was possible under the circumstances,

369
00:25:39,207 --> 00:25:41,283
and a Christian burial was given him

370
00:25:42,017 --> 00:25:44,701
I was not personally acquainted with Mr. Carwen,

371
00:25:45,236 --> 00:25:49,630
save for one encounter where he demonstrated grief and deep compassion

372
00:25:49,975 --> 00:25:51,351
at the passing of a friend

373
00:25:52,365 --> 00:25:55,130
I knew him by reputation as an earnest worker

374
00:25:55,896 --> 00:25:58,633
and a diligent believer in right and wrong

375
00:25:59,817 --> 00:26:04,172
His memory I am sure will always be with those who knew and loved him,

376
00:26:04,628 --> 00:26:08,232
among whose number I imagine you as first

377
00:26:09,165 --> 00:26:10,120
A letter from you

378
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:12,322
which I found in his tent

379
00:26:13,117 --> 00:26:16,123
causes me to convey this sad intelligence to you

380
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:18,153
Sincerely yours,

381
00:26:18,865 --> 00:26:19,721
Seth Bullock"

382
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,813
What shall I do with this, Mr. Bullock?

383
00:26:28,726 --> 00:26:30,330
What's your fucking paper for?

384
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:33,012
You fucking publish as witness,

385
00:26:34,098 --> 00:26:35,513
for Hearst and others to read

386
00:26:39,886 --> 00:26:41,842
That's a very nice fucking letter

387
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:55,273
Mr. Blazanov,

388
00:26:56,678 --> 00:26:59,211
had you much traffic tonight on your apparatus?

389
00:26:59,756 --> 00:27:01,513
Some traffic, yes

390
00:27:02,607 --> 00:27:05,292
I hope your important meeting had a good result

391
00:27:05,397 --> 00:27:07,280
As free men

392
00:27:07,966 --> 00:27:09,770
facing important challenges, we

393
00:27:10,867 --> 00:27:12,280
choose to be optimistic

394
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:19,232
Sir, I ask you to take me to Mr. Swearengen's place

395
00:27:19,485 --> 00:27:20,122
Well, I

396
00:27:20,795 --> 00:27:22,660
I will, of course, Mr. Blazanov, though

397
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:26,560
no activity you may contemplate, for example,

398
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:28,743
the making of friends with is female employees,

399
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:30,953
requires Mr. Swearengen's personal approval

400
00:27:32,258 --> 00:27:34,951
I wish to see him for another purpose

401
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:38,163
All right

402
00:27:42,108 --> 00:27:43,163
Shall we go now?

403
00:27:44,086 --> 00:27:44,731
Certainly

404
00:27:57,857 --> 00:27:58,531
Come on

405
00:28:02,197 --> 00:28:03,193
Lovely letter, wasn't it?

406
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:05,312
Didn't you…

407
00:28:05,905 --> 00:28:07,673
come back sick from one of them meetings?

408
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:10,043
Last year, from the peaches

409
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:12,691
Which is why I refrained this time around

410
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:16,701
Far as the fire wagon, I hater you felt as I did,

411
00:28:18,036 --> 00:28:19,640
the moment was wrong to broach it

412
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:20,770
My

413
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,110
my throat is all fucking tight

414
00:28:26,608 --> 00:28:28,651
Where did you lay your hands on liquor, Harry?

415
00:28:29,785 --> 00:28:30,200
Harry?

416
00:28:31,895 --> 00:28:32,522
Help!

417
00:28:33,225 --> 00:28:35,232
Harry? Harry!

418
00:28:36,246 --> 00:28:36,860
Help!

419
00:28:38,238 --> 00:28:41,092
Oh.Look, Jack

420
00:28:41,757 --> 00:28:43,940
White lumps on my tongue

421
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:46,293
Reel it in, for God's sake

422
00:28:46,698 --> 00:28:47,351
I'm so sorry

423
00:28:48,756 --> 00:28:49,802
It's close, Jack

424
00:28:50,616 --> 00:28:51,533
It's very close

425
00:28:52,376 --> 00:28:54,452
I feel it's icy breath

426
00:28:55,076 --> 00:28:57,583
I hear it whispering in my ear

427
00:28:58,206 --> 00:28:59,581
"Forget your name

428
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:02,171
We go to black"

429
00:29:04,288 --> 00:29:06,583
The downstairs buffet is quite passable

430
00:29:13,286 --> 00:29:16,740
As like to kill you as take passage with you to Liberia,

431
00:29:17,196 --> 00:29:19,052
his man you meeting in New York

432
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:21,351
If Mr. Hearst wanted me killed, Mama,

433
00:29:21,645 --> 00:29:22,601
he could see it done here

434
00:29:22,837 --> 00:29:25,720
Don't you ever believe you know what'd please that man,

435
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:28,162
or salt him to come after you

436
00:29:30,305 --> 00:29:33,042
And you look a fool holding that cigar!

437
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,650
I've played on for smaller stakes

438
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:38,913
And the gold ain't playing

439
00:29:39,358 --> 00:29:40,722
I ain't trying to steal nothing

440
00:29:41,037 --> 00:29:42,273
I'll work my way up the hog

441
00:29:43,087 --> 00:29:45,312
And ain't you sent me out there so I can turn out a man?

442
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:49,360
I sent you so the hell that was coming here for niggers wouldn't burn you up

443
00:29:49,685 --> 00:29:51,031
There's plenty of fire in Liberia

444
00:29:51,705 --> 00:29:53,770
I can't undo what I done, Odell,

445
00:29:54,345 --> 00:29:56,161
any more than you can, searching out hurt

446
00:29:56,477 --> 00:29:57,563
I ain't searching no hurt out

447
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,290
We all get our portion

448
00:29:59,588 --> 00:30:01,081
We don't need to draw it to us

449
00:30:01,305 --> 00:30:01,950
You hear me, Mama?

450
00:30:02,456 --> 00:30:04,460
I ain't searching no Goddamn hurt out

451
00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:07,030
I don't told you to mind who you talking to

452
00:30:07,745 --> 00:30:08,413
All right, Mama

453
00:30:08,845 --> 00:30:09,841
No bad language

454
00:30:10,788 --> 00:30:13,461
If you'd kept me to raise me, maybe I'd know

455
00:30:21,326 --> 00:30:25,852
He got $742 for you, the little nigger at the livery

456
00:30:26,746 --> 00:30:28,522
And this brooch here too, you can take

457
00:30:29,298 --> 00:30:30,352
I can't find it

458
00:30:31,136 --> 00:30:32,620
I can't find it

459
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:34,882
Lord Jesus, forgive me!

460
00:30:36,646 --> 00:30:38,363
When I read you had stayed in the Comstock,

461
00:30:38,616 --> 00:30:42,521
I tried to come here quick, be gone before he sent for you to come

462
00:30:43,866 --> 00:30:45,003
I ain't come here to hurt you

463
00:30:46,015 --> 00:30:48,093
I never said you come to do me hurt

464
00:30:49,596 --> 00:30:51,433
So's you wouldn't have to see me

465
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:55,060
I prayed to see you every day you was gone

466
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:58,861
My God, Odell, what's wrong with you?

467
00:30:59,246 --> 00:31:01,873
No joy to seeing my boy!

468
00:31:04,545 --> 00:31:05,933
I'm sorry, son

469
00:31:06,085 --> 00:31:07,373
Hush, Mama.Hush

470
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:08,933
Hush

471
00:31:10,325 --> 00:31:11,821
Oh, do what you think you got to

472
00:31:12,347 --> 00:31:13,891
I couldn't find the right

473
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:16,893
Hush now, Mama.Hush

474
00:31:18,988 --> 00:31:19,770
I got you now

475
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,382
"Bricks." You see there?

476
00:31:24,265 --> 00:31:25,082
Yes, I see

477
00:31:25,727 --> 00:31:26,220
"Bricks

478
00:31:26,505 --> 00:31:27,510
25 bricks

479
00:31:27,877 --> 00:31:28,350
Stop

480
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,182
Addition to initial order. Stop

481
00:31:31,778 --> 00:31:33,610
First means of delivery. Stop

482
00:31:33,956 --> 00:31:35,061
And, Blazanov?

483
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:37,962
Do you believe, Mr. Swearengen,

484
00:31:39,126 --> 00:31:41,691
Mr. Hearst orders more bricks?

485
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:42,720
No

486
00:31:44,318 --> 00:31:45,163
What do you believe?

487
00:31:46,347 --> 00:31:49,620
I believe he orders more humans

488
00:31:49,865 --> 00:31:50,451
Reinforcements

489
00:31:50,685 --> 00:31:51,503
To do harm!

490
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:54,523
As we saw on our walk

491
00:31:55,178 --> 00:31:58,271
Leave to die in a country strange to them,

492
00:31:58,537 --> 00:32:04,163
men apart from their families, working to give them support

493
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:09,860
Fuck confidentiality of communications

494
00:32:10,006 --> 00:32:11,411
Why not fuck a woman instead?

495
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:12,851
I hope so eventually

496
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:18,081
Now I deliver under seal his message to Mr. Hearst

497
00:32:19,197 --> 00:32:20,813
I'll dispose of this, Blazanov

498
00:32:28,965 --> 00:32:30,951
How are you occupying yourself, Richardson?

499
00:32:32,445 --> 00:32:34,232
I'm praying the meeting went well

500
00:32:34,906 --> 00:32:35,531
Very touching

501
00:32:36,946 --> 00:32:40,053
Now clear your mind of the meeting

502
00:32:40,736 --> 00:32:42,893
and account for the negro with Hearst

503
00:32:43,818 --> 00:32:45,211
They're both in her room

504
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:49,932
Despite your best efforts, Richardson,

505
00:32:50,617 --> 00:32:52,570
an answer of some ambiguity

506
00:32:54,856 --> 00:32:56,312
Is she with them?

507
00:32:56,687 --> 00:32:57,151
One

508
00:32:57,678 --> 00:32:58,242
One what?

509
00:32:59,268 --> 00:32:59,972
Of them

510
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:01,290
Is with her

511
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:02,731
Who?

512
00:33:02,927 --> 00:33:03,671
Aunt Lou

513
00:33:04,017 --> 00:33:05,221
Who is with Aunt Lou?

514
00:33:05,507 --> 00:33:06,210
Her son

515
00:33:08,388 --> 00:33:09,420
And where is Hearst?

516
00:33:09,706 --> 00:33:10,262
His room

517
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:15,371
Then I will retire to mine

518
00:33:16,115 --> 00:33:17,691
Well, how was the meeting?

519
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,781
I imagine the pool that spawned you

520
00:33:26,357 --> 00:33:27,251
I am filling it with rocks

521
00:33:28,886 --> 00:33:30,771
I am holding shut your gills

522
00:33:31,988 --> 00:33:33,811
To prevent you from taking in air

523
00:33:38,036 --> 00:33:40,461
I suppose the meeting went quite well

524
00:33:49,605 --> 00:33:50,822
I itch

525
00:33:52,255 --> 00:33:53,123
Dust

526
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:57,202
No matter how much regularity of cleaning or consideration for the children,

527
00:33:57,657 --> 00:33:59,422
a place like this is filled with dust

528
00:34:04,498 --> 00:34:05,482
He's dead

529
00:34:06,688 --> 00:34:11,031
Chesterton is with us still, though to bring him in the evening chill would be imprudent

530
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:13,002
We'll bring him tomorrow

531
00:34:13,988 --> 00:34:15,963
When this room is less cold

532
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:19,280
After the children have gone and before you bring him,

533
00:34:19,566 --> 00:34:21,273
I will give the place a good dust

534
00:34:21,597 --> 00:34:22,960
Then the carpentry will begin

535
00:34:24,237 --> 00:34:25,361
You've engaged the carpenters?

536
00:34:25,537 --> 00:34:26,070
Yes.

537
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:29,162
He is close to the end, isn't he?

538
00:34:29,547 --> 00:34:31,041
Yes, Bellegarde!

539
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:34,273
For Christ's sake!

540
00:34:56,018 --> 00:34:56,822
Haunted

541
00:34:58,858 --> 00:35:00,270
Drafts from all over

542
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,593
From the walls, from the side,

543
00:35:03,747 --> 00:35:05,143
swooping down from the ceiling

544
00:35:05,925 --> 00:35:10,410
I will dust anyway for Chesterton, even though after,

545
00:35:11,015 --> 00:35:12,081
the carpenters come

546
00:35:14,065 --> 00:35:19,323
Uh, the attitude on people leaving definitely stepped forward from the attitude they wore coming in

547
00:35:19,587 --> 00:35:21,082
I mean, no one's trying to quarrel about that

548
00:35:21,516 --> 00:35:22,330
Then what's your quarrel?

549
00:35:24,597 --> 00:35:27,023
I'm asking what was decided

550
00:35:29,858 --> 00:35:32,101
They're publishing the letter as witness

551
00:35:32,538 --> 00:35:33,112
Witness?

552
00:35:33,356 --> 00:35:34,722
A witness in the sense that

553
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:36,911
Witness the letter

554
00:35:38,257 --> 00:35:39,111
its content

555
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:42,863
Yeah, the letter's contents is witness that…

556
00:35:44,568 --> 00:35:46,172
Bullock wrote a nice fucking letter

557
00:35:48,706 --> 00:35:50,201
And it proves…

558
00:35:51,908 --> 00:35:54,000
that that's the sort we are here,

559
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,463
the caring sort that would write a letter of that ilk

560
00:35:57,766 --> 00:35:59,620
Furthermore, we don't give a fuck who knows it,

561
00:36:01,006 --> 00:36:02,740
George fucking Hearst included

562
00:36:02,926 --> 00:36:04,392
Fucking Hearst especially

563
00:36:05,918 --> 00:36:07,022
Is the witness?

564
00:36:07,485 --> 00:36:09,611
Better late than fucking never, Johnny

565
00:36:13,295 --> 00:36:16,063
Hey! Little Miss fucking cinnamon

566
00:36:50,827 --> 00:36:51,723
I wanna be good

567
00:36:54,427 --> 00:36:55,462
I wanna be good

568
00:37:12,305 --> 00:37:12,953
Good evening

569
00:37:17,615 --> 00:37:18,581
Good evening

570
00:37:25,615 --> 00:37:26,611
For being gone, I

571
00:37:27,656 --> 00:37:29,412
I notice I'm frequently back

572
00:37:31,328 --> 00:37:32,862
I come to kiss her good night

573
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,661
I tried to persuade her you'd done so last night

574
00:37:36,975 --> 00:37:38,160
My beard always wakes her

575
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:40,402
She said so, refuting me

576
00:37:46,877 --> 00:37:50,441
The thing I did that made you leave last night,

577
00:37:50,955 --> 00:37:54,872
the thing I was coming home to do again…

578
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,233
I pray now to forego forever

579
00:37:59,065 --> 00:38:01,963
Not having me in this house is gonna improve your odds

580
00:38:02,577 --> 00:38:05,351
I started using spirits at 17, Ellsworth,

581
00:38:05,806 --> 00:38:07,272
with no premonition we'd marry

582
00:38:07,938 --> 00:38:12,160
Well, my feeling's that being vessel of purposes not your own,

583
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,033
your eye was out for relief

584
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:18,992
But glimpsing since how being your own vessel is preferable,

585
00:38:19,846 --> 00:38:24,061
let the pressure come off and you're liable to do all right

586
00:38:26,576 --> 00:38:28,753
You are no pressure

587
00:38:30,257 --> 00:38:31,053
My…

588
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:36,812
friendly hands'll always be out to both of you

589
00:38:43,918 --> 00:38:47,313
May I interrupt her sleep with this beard?

590
00:38:49,706 --> 00:38:51,722
She'd be so glad if you did

591
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:09,790
Yes

592
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:12,132
Cheyenne and Black Hills Telegraph

593
00:39:12,977 --> 00:39:13,973
Yes, all right

594
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:28,441
Evening

595
00:39:28,635 --> 00:39:29,871
Telegram for Mr. Hearst

596
00:39:30,407 --> 00:39:31,110
Ah, thank you

597
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:35,421
I wonder if you might remain just a moment while I read it,

598
00:39:35,785 --> 00:39:37,111
on the chance I'll want to answer

599
00:39:37,556 --> 00:39:38,243
Of course

600
00:39:40,917 --> 00:39:42,730
"Additional shipment of bricks."

601
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:43,542
Yes, Sir

602
00:39:44,556 --> 00:39:44,992
Yeah, this is fine

603
00:39:45,396 --> 00:39:45,920
This is fine

604
00:39:48,945 --> 00:39:49,962
There'll be no answer

605
00:39:50,868 --> 00:39:52,470
This is $20, Sir

606
00:39:53,155 --> 00:39:54,003
It's all right, son

607
00:39:54,386 --> 00:39:55,673
Thanks for doing your job well

608
00:39:57,016 --> 00:39:57,951
You're most welcome

609
00:40:03,675 --> 00:40:04,940
John Langrishe, Al

610
00:40:06,108 --> 00:40:07,170
Come one, Jack

611
00:40:10,266 --> 00:40:11,510
Early finish below?

612
00:40:11,888 --> 00:40:12,552
We'd a meetin'

613
00:40:13,028 --> 00:40:14,070
I ought to have asked you too

614
00:40:15,107 --> 00:40:20,441
What topic commended my presence? Reprobates? The elderly?

615
00:40:20,707 --> 00:40:21,353
Fuckin' Hearst

616
00:40:22,185 --> 00:40:24,362
that took an axe to my left middle digit,

617
00:40:25,076 --> 00:40:29,680
sends for 25 more thugs to take the tool to the whole fucking camp

618
00:40:31,018 --> 00:40:33,302
Why am I fucking optimistic?

619
00:40:34,158 --> 00:40:37,100
Did your meeting find a strategy in counterpoise?

620
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:39,843
We heard the fucking reading of a letter

621
00:40:41,777 --> 00:40:42,652
Ahh

622
00:40:43,085 --> 00:40:47,471
Writ by Bullock, to a miner's family after Hearst had had him murdered

623
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,172
Exhorting they charge Hearst with the crime?

624
00:40:50,478 --> 00:40:51,621
Never once mentioning Hearst

625
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:55,563
Expressing sympathy to the family, respect for the way the man lived

626
00:40:56,638 --> 00:41:00,012
We decided Merrick would publish in the paper

627
00:41:01,797 --> 00:41:07,483
Strategy some may call ingenuous, others merely off the point

628
00:41:07,818 --> 00:41:11,641
I sit mystified I was moved to endorse it

629
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,153
Mystified, Al,

630
00:41:14,947 --> 00:41:18,090
at proclaiming a law beyond law to a man who's beyond law himself?

631
00:41:18,907 --> 00:41:25,113
It's publication invoking a decency whose scrutiny applies to him as to all his fellows

632
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:28,703
I call that strategy cunningly sophisticated,

633
00:41:28,868 --> 00:41:33,070
befitting and becoming the man who sits before me

634
00:41:42,297 --> 00:41:43,580
Open the place back up!

635
00:41:44,238 --> 00:41:46,261
Tell the whores if their legs ain't in the air,

636
00:41:46,756 --> 00:41:48,233
they'd better be off their asses!

637
00:41:53,675 --> 00:41:55,312
So what progress in your affairs?

638
00:41:57,086 --> 00:41:58,860
Our opening is delayed

639
00:42:00,146 --> 00:42:01,630
And old man is dying

640
00:42:02,476 --> 00:42:03,681
one of my actors.

641
00:42:04,836 --> 00:42:05,590
And…

642
00:42:07,475 --> 00:42:08,251
I'm sad

643
00:42:18,675 --> 00:42:19,373
Oh…

644
00:42:20,536 --> 00:42:21,782
perhaps just the one

645
00:42:27,335 --> 00:42:28,120
In?

646
00:42:28,415 --> 00:42:31,503
Folded up on the boardwalk beside me like a Goddamn accordion

647
00:42:31,857 --> 00:42:33,263
So you've remarked

648
00:42:38,426 --> 00:42:40,510
I believe I'll take my leave…

649
00:42:40,635 --> 00:42:42,902
You're wheezing bad as me, Doc. Did you get cinnamon too?

650
00:42:43,258 --> 00:42:45,901
…Lest I distract from the business at hand

651
00:42:46,917 --> 00:42:48,592
by requesting a fucking drink!

652
00:42:48,915 --> 00:42:52,201
Have you adverse reactions to other food or condiments, Harry?

653
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,722
Eggplant shreds the roof of my mouth if it's any of your fucking business

654
00:42:56,146 --> 00:42:58,931
Irratability at the bowel, we know you suffer from

655
00:43:00,275 --> 00:43:01,223
You're all right

656
00:43:01,877 --> 00:43:03,963
Don't eat cinnamon anymore

657
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:05,341
Or eggplant?

658
00:43:05,535 --> 00:43:07,503
Not if it shreds your mouth

659
00:43:13,738 --> 00:43:16,182
Hope you don't mind my absconding with you from your cabin, Doc

660
00:43:16,537 --> 00:43:17,080
No

661
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:19,261
Campaigning any threat to Harry's health?

662
00:43:24,628 --> 00:43:25,352
How was the meeting?

663
00:43:25,965 --> 00:43:26,900
Oh, it was all right

664
00:43:27,468 --> 00:43:29,372
Um, needless to say, we missed you

665
00:43:48,755 --> 00:43:53,173
I am so glad your mother isn't alive to see you in this condition

666
00:43:54,486 --> 00:43:56,321
Doc, get up here

667
00:43:58,225 --> 00:43:59,123
Not tonight

668
00:43:59,588 --> 00:44:00,860
Tonight. Now

669
00:44:03,788 --> 00:44:04,641
Leave your kit

670
00:44:05,027 --> 00:44:06,241
I'll have Johnny go get it

671
00:44:07,076 --> 00:44:09,341
I'm not gonna leave my fucking kit

672
00:44:25,716 --> 00:44:28,110
I wonder what you think you're fucking doing

673
00:44:28,867 --> 00:44:30,631
I'm laying down before I leave in the morning

674
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,083
I will ask the questions here!

675
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:35,302
This is my place

676
00:44:35,936 --> 00:44:38,751
Do you think it's yours? It is not

677
00:44:39,256 --> 00:44:41,680
It is mine, bought and paid for

678
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:48,690
And if I wanted to shit this instant in the middle of this stable, no man, black or white, could gainsay me!

679
00:44:50,365 --> 00:44:51,620
You've already fucked a horse

680
00:44:52,466 --> 00:44:57,940
Nor will I stoop to explaining the mistake in that statement,

681
00:44:58,467 --> 00:45:02,921
to a nigger lemur or some other small form of monkey

682
00:45:07,755 --> 00:45:08,791
Where are you going in the morning?

683
00:45:09,657 --> 00:45:10,130
West

684
00:45:11,196 --> 00:45:12,143
San Francisco

685
00:45:13,735 --> 00:45:16,600
I'm hoping that chestnut's owner might go with me

686
00:45:17,675 --> 00:45:19,601
The demon nigger that appeared at the bar

687
00:45:20,156 --> 00:45:20,780
The very same

688
00:45:27,397 --> 00:45:28,460
I don't suppose

689
00:45:30,356 --> 00:45:36,682
knowing I'd be vigilant against theft and intolerant to tardiness

690
00:45:37,046 --> 00:45:38,723
you'd be inclined to stay on and work here

691
00:45:41,707 --> 00:45:42,633
No

692
00:45:43,955 --> 00:45:45,923
Nor would I want to fucking have you!

693
00:45:47,567 --> 00:45:50,551
And do not come and try to murder me as I sleep!

694
00:45:52,725 --> 00:45:53,591
And…

695
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:58,151
I will not come and try to murder you

696
00:46:07,335 --> 00:46:08,941
Black fucking bastard

697
00:46:13,117 --> 00:46:15,363
What did you want?

698
00:46:15,988 --> 00:46:17,391
Fucking sick, I'm told

699
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:18,982
I have a chest cold

700
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:20,831
You're a lunger

701
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:33,251
Fucking samples, Doc

702
00:46:33,737 --> 00:46:36,683
Notions from that tailor as to how we cover my stump

703
00:46:38,528 --> 00:46:42,873
I've believed for the last dozen years that disease is airborne,

704
00:46:43,376 --> 00:46:45,692
and I won't make others sick

705
00:46:46,787 --> 00:46:48,293
No one gets out alive, Doc

706
00:47:13,168 --> 00:47:14,432
Jesus Christ!

707
00:47:15,398 --> 00:47:19,480
The fucking gimp finds something useful to do in the fucking brace you made her!

708
00:47:19,776 --> 00:47:21,683
Do you think you could treat being Johnny

709
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:24,130
always struggling to fashion a thought?!

710
00:47:24,688 --> 00:47:30,172
Every fucking night I, that could cut a throat but sleep the sleep of the just,

711
00:47:30,568 --> 00:47:34,572
spend six fucking wakings trying to find a piss pot with my dribble,

712
00:47:35,057 --> 00:47:37,442
and wondering when I got to be so old

713
00:47:40,695 --> 00:47:42,782
Pick a fucking swatch for a spit rag,

714
00:47:43,315 --> 00:47:44,521
use the others for masks,

715
00:47:44,627 --> 00:47:46,113
and go about your fucking business!

716
00:47:46,735 --> 00:47:49,551
I ain't learning a new Doc's quirks!

717
