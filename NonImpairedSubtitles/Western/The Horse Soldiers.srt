1
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,795
I left my love, my love I left

2
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,992
A-sleeping in her bed

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,355
I turned my back on my true love

4
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,914
Went fighting Johnny Reb

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,636
I left my love a letter

6
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,435
In the holler of a tree

7
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,196
I told her she would find me

8
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,551
In the US Cavalry

9
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,875
Hi-ho, down they go

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,594
There's no such word as "can't"

11
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,156
We'll ride clean down to hell and back

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,352
For Ulysses Simpson Grant

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,710
Hi-ho, down they go

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,274
There's no such word as "can't"

15
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,915
We'll ride clean down to hell and back

16
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,077
For Ulysses Simpson Grant

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,475
§ I left my love, my love I left

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,479
§ A-sleeping in her bed

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,160
I turned my back on my true love

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,238
Went fighting Johnny Reb

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,356
I left my love a letter

22
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,758
In the holler of a tree

23
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,996
I told her she would find me

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,554
In the US Cavalry

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,911
In the US Cavalry

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,190
Hi-ho, down they go

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,834
There's no such word as "can't"

28
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,158
We'll ride clean down to New Orleans

29
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,037
For Ulysses Simpson Grant

30
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,597
General Hurlburt, by appointment.

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,119
- General Hurlburt and Colonel Marlowe.
- Steve, come in.

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,674
Hello, Sam. Colonel Marlowe.

33
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,156
(exchange of greetings)

34
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,272
- General Sherman, Colonel Marlowe.
- How do you do?

35
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,358
Marlowe, I've been anxious to meet you.

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,353
- It's a privilege, sir.
- Sit down.

37
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,789
- Is this your first look at Vicksburg?
- Yes, sir.

38
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,914
We've been looking at it
for ten months, and we don't like it.

39
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,068
Colonel, for your benefit, the war
on our side hasn't been going well at all.

40
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,149
Not in Washington,
not in the newspapers, not in the field.

41
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,034
To put it mildly, with less men
and less resources,

42
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,197
the South has whipped us to a standstill.

43
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,276
(cannon fire)

44
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,878
Now, if I could take Vicksburg...

45
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,235
the whole picture would change,
but I'd have to do it this summer.

46
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,510
Or sit out here another year.

47
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,156
Which might cost us 100,000 men.
It might cost us a war.

48
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,435
Which brings this talk to their main source
of supply - and a thorn in our side.

49
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,516
- Newton Station.
- Sam.

50
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,792
Marlowe has worked out the details
of your plan pretty thoroughly.

51
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,357
If I could get back to La Grange
right away, we could leave by Thursday.

52
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,236
Good. Who would your people be?

53
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,592
My own First Illinois with Secord's
First Michigan and Second lowa.

54
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,836
We'd be culled down to a short brigade.

55
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,988
Cross at La Grange, down through Ripley,
New Albany, Houston...

56
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,636
- Is there something wrong, sir?
- I know the map. Proceed.

57
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,197
Anyway, the main trick is
no fighting until we hit Newton Station.

58
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,629
How much track do you figure to destroy?

59
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,436
As much as I can. At least enough
to keep them busy for a couple of months.

60
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,838
Otherwise, the raid would
just be another horse ride.

61
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:18,479
All right, Colonel, go ahead. All the rails,
ties, buildings, bridges, rolling stock.

62
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,558
Sam, even if he should
get through to Newton Station,

63
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,638
he'd be 300 miles dead centre
in the Confederacy.

64
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,513
- Have you thought how you'd get back?
- Have you, sir?

65
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,276
Well, I guess I asked for that.

66
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,915
But I hate to think of you sitting it out
in Andersonville Prison.

67
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,919
- It's a hellhole.
- I'd think about that twice, too, sir.

68
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,990
Well, Colonel, your success.

69
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,512
THE UNION CAVALRY DEPOT
AT LA GRANGE, TENNESSEE

70
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,675
All right, here is La Grange.

71
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,116
- We will make 35 miles a day, average.
- 35?

72
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,879
35? Isn't that stretching it a bit?

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,675
It will be the first day, Ned.
I intend to make twice that distance.

74
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,758
In an operation like this,
everything is stretched.

75
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,836
Now, just hold on a minute, John.

76
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,838
Cutting the men's rations
from five days to three...

77
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,317
They'll have to live off the land eventually.
They might as well get used to it.

78
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,389
They seem excited. There's a rumour
they're headed for Nashville and a parade.

79
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,274
That was a good rumour to spread,
with the help of the Sergeant Major.

80
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,358
- Thank you, sir.
- And, gentlemen,

81
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,631
I'll have to admit they had me fooled too.

82
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,675
You see, I was going to use my leave
to do a little electioneering back home.

83
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,190
You know, shake a few hands,
kiss a few babies.

84
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,278
You see, I'm running for Congress this fall.

85
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,154
Well, there's 30,000 votes
at Andersonville, Phil.

86
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,352
I hope you don't get to shake
any of their hands.

87
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,271
Leaves are being cancelled,
orders to reshoe the whole blasted outfit,

88
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,675
and some of them shoes
ain't even shiny yet.

89
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,392
Yep.

90
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:18,834
I'm trying to figure out what's up. They've
been sitting under that tree all morning.

91
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,114
I heard some scuttlebutt about us being
pulled out for a big parade up North.

92
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,074
- I figure we're heading for Nashville.
- That's to my liking.

93
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,273
A parade, and then leave.
Now this war is starting to shape up.

94
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,229
- Where's the officers' conference?
- Over under that tree yonder, sir.

95
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,316
Thank you.

96
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,518
- My apologies for being late.
- Understood.

97
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,916
- Sit down, Major.
- I don't believe I know the Major.

98
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,350
I'm sorry.
Colonel Marlowe, Major Kendall.

99
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,232
- How do you do?
- Glad to know you.

100
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,399
Major Kendall has just been
assigned to us by General Grant.

101
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,911
The Major seems to be out of uniform.
Where are your side arms, Kendall?

102
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,150
If you look in the book, you'll see
a surgeon doesn't carry them.

103
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,833
Surgeon? You cut out our artillery and
our wagons. Nothing to slow us down.

104
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,997
And now you saddle us
with a doctor and a medical unit?

105
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,351
Regulations, John. Kendall goes along.

106
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,550
Very well, sir. Any questions?

107
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,150
- All I can say is I'm glad for some action.
- No glory hunting.

108
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,956
If anything knocks this into a cocked hat,
it'll be a firefight. Is that all, sir?

109
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,039
- Logan, is Brady ready?
- Oh, a photograph.

110
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,789
Move away. Move back.

111
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,559
Are you ready for us, Brady?

112
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,869
Colonel. Sit down, Colonel.

113
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,115
- Thank you very much.
- That's all right.

114
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,199
- Sit down, Marlowe.
- No hats, please, gentlemen.

115
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,796
That's right. Nice and relaxed.

116
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,754
Now, roses are red, violets are blue,
the camera's looking straight at you.

117
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,236
Oh, I must have another one.
That man in the white coat moved.

118
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,069
That isn't all he'll be moving before long.
General, is that all?

119
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,670
That's all, gentlemen.
Thank you, Brady.

120
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,156
Thank you, General.
Thank you very much.

121
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,956
Sit down.

122
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,868
Colonel, I gather you're not too happy
about my going along.

123
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,753
I hadn't counted on you, that's all.

124
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,476
I can understand your reasons for
trying to avoid a fight, tactically speaking.

125
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,592
But you're going very deep
into enemy territory.

126
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,792
Tell me, what did you intend to do
about your wounded?

127
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,639
I intend to move, and move fast.

128
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,833
Those too badly shot up to carry on
will be left to the clemency of the enemy.

129
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,392
- Civilian or military.
- Including yourself?

130
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,476
Naturally.

131
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,428
That's a pretty primitive attitude.
Medically speaking.

132
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,997
Well, Doctor,
war isn't exactly a civilised business.

133
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,478
Of course, I realise that it gives you fellas
a wider field of opportunity...

134
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,751
- For experimenting, Colonel?
- I didn't say that.

135
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,552
- Mitch.
- Yes, sir?

136
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,150
- Give the doctor a full roster.
- Yes, sir.

137
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,111
Examine every man.

138
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,553
Throw out any man who - in your
unchallenged opinion, of course - is unfit.

139
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,151
Even those who might get sick
a week from today.

140
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,999
Look, I didn't ask
to be assigned to this mission.

141
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,079
I'm a military doctor. I've been ordered
to go and I'm going to do my job.

142
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,350
So get off my back.

143
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,669
- Bugler!
- Yes, sir?

144
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,271
- Get me Mitchell.
- Sergeant Major Mitchell's in the hospital.

145
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,828
- How old are you?
- 32, sir.

146
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,509
Join that group.

147
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,870
Hang on, son. Here we go.

148
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,356
(yells)

149
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,596
(metal clanks)

150
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,674
This is going to hurt worse.

151
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,631
There. He'll be all right.

152
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,155
- I got your sick list, Kendall.
- Good. I'm glad it's a short one.

153
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,032
We'll let that drain full out.

154
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,913
- I approve of that, Doctor.
- The lad had quite a boil.

155
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,157
I didn't come here to watch you
carving anybody's behind.

156
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,432
- Why's Mitchell's name on that list?
- Sir, we observe quiet here.

157
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,949
- What's this?
- Hoppy, this is Colonel Marlowe.

158
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,835
How do you do? Stand in line.
We'll take care of you presently.

159
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,918
- Is he going with us?
- He's a good man. I need him.

160
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,989
- I need Mitchell. He's strong as a bull.
- Let me show you something.

161
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,992
Colonel, I've been trying to tell the doctor
that this is nothing unusual.

162
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,475
Not for a man with malaria.

163
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,239
There's nothing new about this, Kendall.

164
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,591
I've seen him ride 40 miles
in one day, shivering.

165
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,871
- He always gets malaria.
- So you concur in my diagnosis.

166
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,230
Mitch, get out of bed. I got some whiskey.

167
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,396
You stay where you are, Sergeant.

168
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,117
I was ordered to take off the duty roster
any man who in my opinion was unfit.

169
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,471
He's sick and he's going to stay here.
Those are my orders.

170
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,956
You've read the whole book, haven't you?

171
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,236
(kicks buckets)

172
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,033
Oh, Colonel!

173
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,833
We got that fella
with all them stripes for you.

174
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,351
- Bring him in.
- We hauled him right off the train.

175
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,040
- Sergeant Kirby reporting, sir.
- Well, Kirby.

176
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,913
Besides being drunk,
what's got you riled up?

177
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,349
They got me in town.
Pulled me off the train.

178
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,710
Just gotten filled. My first in two years.

179
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,593
They tell me you're good. You better be.

180
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,712
You're replacing the best soldier
in the regiment.

181
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,436
- I expect you to be happy about that.
- I could be happier where I was going.

182
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,313
- You got me there.
- No, sir, you got me here.

183
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,590
- Sir.
- Sir.

184
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,553
March this sergeant
to the river and throw him in.

185
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,477
- Clothes and all?
- Clothes and all.

186
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,717
Pump him full of black coffee
till it runs out his ears.

187
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,230
Kirby, when you come back,
come back sober. You've got two hours.

188
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,194
- Parades, Nashville...
- You can leave that keg.

189
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,393
You're welcome to it... sir.

190
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,715
Tangle with me and I'll have your hide.

191
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,675
You're welcome to that too, sir.
If it's in the line of duty.

192
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,798
( bugle)

193
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,637
- Forward, left!
- (others) Forward, left!

194
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,271
- Yo-oh!
- (others) Yo-oh!

195
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,355
 (male choir) I left my love
My love I left, a-sleeping in her bed

196
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,270
I turned my back on my true love
Went fighting Johnny Reb

197
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:05,799
I left my love a letter
in the holler of a tree...

198
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,833
- Good luck, John.
- Thank you, sir.

199
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,115
Hi-ho, down they go
There's no such word as "can't"

200
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,952
We'll ride clean down to hell and back
for Ulysses Simpson Grant

201
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:29,519
I left my love a letter
in the holler of a tree

202
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,475
I told her she would find me
in the US Cavalry

203
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,672
In the US Cavalry

204
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,590
Hi-ho, down they go
There's no such word as "can't"

205
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,759
We'll ride clean down to New Orleans

206
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,876
For Ulysses Simpson Grant

207
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,709
I left my love
My love I left

208
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:05,790
A-sleeping in her bed

209
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,356
Wait on here a minute.

210
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,632
- The sun, it raises in the east every time?
- It sure does in Missouri.

211
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,275
For eight hours, with no turning,
we've been heading this way.

212
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,437
If the sun raises in the east,
what direction is that?

213
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,269
- It ain't north.
- Course not. It's south.

214
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,154
We've been riding smack-dab
into reb territory.

215
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,918
- Reb country, Richard.
- Yes, sir.

216
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,317
Send out your scouts.

217
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,877
(yells order)

218
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,111
(yells order)

219
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,270
(gunfire)

220
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,237
Are you going to call a halt, or leave them
to the clemency of the enemy?

221
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,674
Sound recall.

222
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,756
( bugle)

223
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,994
Just a patrol, sir. No sign of any
major force, as far as I could tell.

224
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,429
The fact remains we've been spotted.

225
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:40,556
The word's out for sure now. They'll be
back here with everything available.

226
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,353
All right, Ned,
you can prepare to turn back.

227
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,631
That's a bad mistake, John,
splitting the force.

228
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,196
Now you need every man you've got.
Diversion be damned.

229
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,869
- They've got to think we all turned back.
- Oh, sure, sure.

230
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,198
But from now on, every Johnny Reb
with a gun will be hiding behind a tree

231
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,276
trying to make a name for himself.

232
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,949
And you want to cut your force
by one third! John, listen to me.

233
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,631
There's an old axiom in politics:
You never split your ballot...

234
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,958
Richard, when the horses are watered
and the men are fed, we'll move out.

235
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,959
Hey, Doctor.

236
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,756
These here contraband children say
there's something wrong at that cabin.

237
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,518
I guess they need a doctor.

238
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,316
All right.

239
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,309
- Are you the doctor?
- Yes, I am.

240
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,597
What happened?

241
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,235
It's Rainey, sir. Rainey the first. He's dead.

242
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,156
Carry on.

243
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,753
Where's Kendall?

244
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,431
Dr Kendall went over to that cabin
with some young coloured people.

245
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,994
- An emergency, I believe.
- He what?!

246
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,955
He went over to that cabin
with some young coloured people.

247
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,556
- Are you the doctor too?
- What? No, no.

248
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,116
(baby cries)

249
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,837
Kendall, what the devil are you doing?

250
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,428
We just delivered a baby.

251
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,516
It's a little girl.

252
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,669
You can take care of her now, Granny.

253
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,155
You're going to be all right.

254
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,676
We've got a couple of wounded men
out there, you know.

255
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,030
No, one's dead.

256
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,077
One's gone, one's born.

257
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,873
It's an amazing process, isn't it?

258
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,152
As many as I've delivered,
it never fails to awe me.

259
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,512
All right, children, you got a new sister.
Go in, take a look at her.

260
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,596
All right, Kendall.
Go back and take care of your wounded.

261
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,632
They'll be all right.
Hopkins knows what to do.

262
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:45,074
You're not a country sawbones. You're
an officer in the Union Army under oath.

263
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,794
I took an older oath before that one.

264
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,675
They didn't seem to be having any trouble
having babies around here before.

265
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:57,430
I was asked to help and I couldn't turn 'em
down. Come off it. Even you were born.

266
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,235
As of now, you are under officer's arrest.

267
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,590
Insubordination.

268
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,791
- Do I still carry out my duties, sir?
- From now on confine them to the troops.

269
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,514
Very well, sir.

270
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,393
Don't push me too far, Kendall.

271
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,158
Forward!

272
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,116
(dogs bark)

273
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,671
Lukey, what are the dogs
raising such a fuss about?

274
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,236
Dogs? You know how dogs
make such a fuss.

275
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,918
- Soldiers, Miss Hannah. Lots of 'em.
- Soldiers? How wonderful!

276
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,479
Thunder in the outhouse.
Them's Yankees.

277
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,273
Lukey, you go on downstairs
and meet them.

278
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,356
Lukey, do you hear?

279
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,199
Come here, girl.

280
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,276
Come on.

281
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,832
- Who lives here?
- Miss Hannah Hunter lives here.

282
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,748
Tell her I want to see her.
Colonel Marlowe, Union Army.

283
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,269
Yes, sir.

284
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,030
Put that gun away.

285
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,596
- Sorry for this intrusion, ma'am.
- It isn't that, Colonel.

286
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:37,353
It's just that I never prepared myself to see
that uniform within the walls of this house.

287
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,552
Ma'am, we no more wish to be here
than you do to have us.

288
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,638
Why, that's gallantly spoken, Colonel.

289
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,880
No matter what our differences,
I fear I'm forgetting the amenities.

290
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,560
- Welcome to Greenbriar, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

291
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,070
Lukey, take the gentlemen's hats.

292
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,515
- Sergeant Kirby.
- Sergeant.

293
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,517
Ma'am.

294
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,792
Well, shall we make ourselves
more comfortable in the Rose Room?

295
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,798
No, thank you, ma'am.
We'll only stay a moment.

296
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,354
You and your men are riding on?

297
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,075
No, we will bivouac
in your woods for the night.

298
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,760
Sleeping on the cold, cold ground?

299
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,758
When is this awful, wasteful,
terrible struggle going to end, Colonel?

300
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,438
Brother against brother...

301
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:34,680
And during our stay no one will
be allowed to leave the premises.

302
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,030
Wherever would we go, Colonel?

303
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,597
I'm sure you must agree that this war
makes loneliness for everyone.

304
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,236
Also, I must commandeer most
of the grain and horses, if you have any.

305
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,990
You will be paid, Miss Hunter,
for everything, in Union greenbacks.

306
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,918
We will not bother you
any longer. Good evening.

307
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,157
- Kirby.
- By your leave, ma'am.

308
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,195
Hannah Hunter, what's got hold of you,
talking like a field hand? You alls, we alls.

309
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,197
Yankees!

310
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,915
It's uncanny, Colonel.

311
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,271
I've heard about 'em, but I didn't believe it.

312
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,473
I received my commission
from the Governor of Michigan!

313
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,160
- Young man...
- What's your question?

314
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,114
The question is this man's authority
in his present position.

315
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,835
As usual, I am trying to present
the grim facts of life.

316
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,679
He doesn't understand
that coffee tastes better

317
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,679
if the latrines are dug
downstream instead of upstream.

318
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,189
How do you like your coffee, Colonel?

319
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,550
- Secord, you oughta...
- Pardon.

320
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,558
Colonel! Colonel Marlowe!

321
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,676
I am forgetting my manners.
Why, how I ever...

322
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,517
Well, I don't believe
I've met these gentlemen.

323
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,998
Miss Hunter. Colonel Secord.
Major Gray. Major Kendall.

324
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,599
Ma'am.

325
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,716
I'm just so scatterbrained.

326
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,469
Poor Papa and Mama must be
turning over in their graves at me

327
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,116
for not extending what little hospitality
Greenbriar can offer.

328
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,437
At least I can extend
an invitation to you for dinner.

329
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,358
- No, Miss Hunter...
- I insist.

330
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,438
There's three fat capons
that have to go anyhow.

331
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,350
What with our store of grain
being reduced, like you mentioned.

332
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,790
So, you see, you brought it
on yourself, didn't you?

333
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,957
Speaking for myself,
I would be delighted...

334
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,834
Very well, thank you.
Hot food is pretty hard to turn down.

335
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,599
Splendid. Now, how many can I count on?

336
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,188
- Would five or six be...?
- Not at all.

337
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,276
Perfectly wonderful.

338
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,118
At nine, gentlemen?

339
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,879
- Colonel Secord?
- Of the First Michigan, ma'am.

340
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,036
- Major Gray?
- Ma'am.

341
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,355
Major... Kendall, isn't it?

342
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,438
I'm afraid I'll have to regret, ma'am.
It's not of my choice, I assure you.

343
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,915
At the moment, I'm under arrest.

344
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,715
We will all be glad to accept
the invitation, Miss Hunter.

345
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,950
Ma'am?

346
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,719
You dropped your handkerchief.

347
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,119
- Care for a little more, Colonel Secord?
- No, thank you, ma'am.

348
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,276
Colonel Marlowe?

349
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,994
- No, thank you.
- Come now, Colonel.

350
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:44,070
A man with a big frame like yours can't
just nibble away like a little old titmouse.

351
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,953
Gentlemen, please be seated.

352
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,598
Now, what was your preference?
The leg... or the breast?

353
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,916
I've had quite enough of both, thank you.

354
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,996
What a shame.

355
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,189
- Would anyone else like some more?
- (all) No, thank you.

356
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,952
Gentlemen, be seated.
I must warn you too, there's no coffee.

357
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,959
And a sweet or a dessert of any kind
was just out of the question.

358
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,310
Sugar's $150 a barrel.

359
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,150
"And yet your fair discourse
hath been as sweet as sugar,

360
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,829
making the hard way
sweet and delectable."

361
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,550
How perfectly charming.
A little something of your own?

362
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,114
No, ma'am. Richard II.

363
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,631
- By profession, I'm an actor.
- Why, how fascinating!

364
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,754
Why, Major Kendall, your cigar.
Gentlemen, please be seated.

365
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,110
(sighs)

366
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,872
Major Kendall a doctor. And
Colonel Secord almost a congressman.

367
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,198
And you an actor.
And now all military men.

368
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,470
Such a waste of talent.

369
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,594
But, of course, Colonel Marlowe, I imagine
that you are a professional soldier.

370
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,554
No, prior to this insanity,
I was a railroad engineer.

371
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,957
Why, how thrilling.

372
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:18,393
To think of being able to steer one of
those huge things, puffing and steaming.

373
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,751
Ringing that little bell.
Ding-dong! Ding-dong!

374
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,112
Not quite. My job was
in the construction of railroads.

375
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,357
Why, my! Such brilliant minds.

376
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,759
Poor little me barely squeezed through
Miss Longstreet's Seminary for Ladies.

377
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,350
How did you ever manage
to remember all those books in college?

378
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:45,191
I didn't. I started driving
rail spikes at ten cents a day and found.

379
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,834
And now, Miss Hunter,
I must ask you to leave us.

380
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,431
We are taking the privilege of using
this room for an hour or two. If we may.

381
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,156
Of course, but wouldn't you prefer
using another room? The study, perhaps?

382
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,989
- We're quite comfortable here.
- (murmurs of agreement)

383
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,078
I'm sorry but I must be rude and explain.

384
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,239
Lukey and I must be in the fields
by five in the morning.

385
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,591
Gentlemen, go ahead
and light your cigars.

386
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,870
- Allow me.
- Thank you kindly.

387
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,390
All this and the dishes must be done
before she can get to bed.

388
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,149
- Am I being too inconsiderate?
- Of course not, ma'am.

389
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,397
- May I?
- Of course. This way, gentlemen.

390
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,069
How wonderful.

391
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,674
Really, I thought it was a charming dinner.

392
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,319
- Post this room.
- Yes, sir.

393
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,275
- I hope you'll be comfortable here.
- Oh, yes. This is fine.

394
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,670
- If you wish to light a fire, it's ready.
- No, it's fine.

395
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,078
- Some brandy. I'll have Lukey bring it.
- No, thank you, no brandy.

396
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,839
Are you sure there's
nothing more that I can...

397
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,393
Oh, yes.

398
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,114
Doctor, there's no need
for you to be a part of this.

399
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,155
Perhaps Miss Hunter would show you
some of the beauties of Greenbriar.

400
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,671
- Why, of course, if he has any interest...
- He'd be pleased to.

401
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,553
Very well. Come, then, Doctor.

402
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,957
I noticed a lovely garden.
Shall we take a stroll?

403
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,352
Why, of course.

404
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,075
You know, you gentlemen must be
comfortable in your heavy uniforms,

405
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,751
but I feel a definite chill in the air -
it's me and my thin blood.

406
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,599
Would you excuse me
while I go and fetch a shawl?

407
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,950
- Miss Hunter.
- Yes, Major?

408
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,755
I'm afraid I'll have to go with you.

409
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,235
Upstairs? With me?

410
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,715
- Why, Major!
- You're only getting a shawl.

411
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,912
Of course,
but in these parts it's unheard of...

412
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,474
It's something
to tell your grandchildren.

413
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,309
This is war. At the moment,
Greenbriar is a military installation.

414
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,036
I don't suppose there's any real harm,
being that you're a doctor.

415
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,116
That's right.

416
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,516
Lukey, bring some brandy
to my sitting room, please.

417
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,153
- I hope you'll be comfortable here, Major.
- Thank you.

418
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,436
Thank you.

419
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,630
Hey! Where are you going with that?

420
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,469
- Miss Hannah asked for this brandy.
- I know, for the Major.

421
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,071
We never give any of our top-ranking
officers an unlabelled bottle,

422
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,953
unless somebody tastes it first.

423
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,799
- Is this what you does? Test things?
- Certainly.

424
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:04,436
See that second stripe? That means
I'm official taster for majors on up.

425
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,150
Here's La Grange.

426
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,354
We've come down here
approximately 80 miles.

427
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,838
- We're headed for Newton Station.
- Any word on the enemy strength there?

428
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,272
No, not a word. Whatever it is,
we're obliged to take it on.

429
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,359
- Good. Maybe we'll see action.
- This is not play-acting.

430
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,600
- Here's your brandy, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

431
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,269
- It's all tested.
- Tested?

432
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,837
By the man downstairs with
those tester's stripes, for majors on up.

433
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,713
Oh, yes. Sergeant Kirby.

434
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:50,072
- He really tested it, didn't he?
- Yes, sir. Twice.

435
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,430
- Lukey?
- Yes, Miss Hannah.

436
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,996
Excuse me, sir.

437
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,676
(Marlowe)... very lucky.

438
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,999
(officers' voices)

439
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:24,672
That is the next piece of information.
We're not going back to La Grange.

440
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,475
- We're what?
- We're not going back north.

441
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:35,472
We're heading south to Baton Rouge
to join up with the Union forces there.

442
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,355
- Great Scott, when did you decide that?
- It's the best way. It's the only way.

443
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,157
John, it is 300 miles
from Newton Station to Baton Rouge.

444
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,239
And it is 300 miles
from Newton Station to La Grange.

445
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:55,514
Only the rebs will really have been closed
in behind us, ready to chew us to bits.

446
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,712
So we'll go out the way
they least expect: Straight south.

447
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:04,039
Damn it, it's suicide. Is it possible your
orders could have been misinterpreted?

448
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,116
My only duty after Newton Station

449
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,835
is to get as many of these men
back alive as I can.

450
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,588
(Secord) And so I still must protest.

451
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,757
What's more, I want that
on the record for General Hurlburt.

452
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,110
It is impetuous mass suicide.

453
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,800
(Marlowe) It's on the record, but get this.

454
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,913
Unless enemy action allows you to
take my place, that's the way it will be.

455
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,510
Blow Newton Station off the map,
then through to Baton Rouge.

456
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,393
There will be no change.
Do you understand?

457
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,556
(Secord) All right, you're in command.

458
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,832
(Marlowe) Now let's go over it again.
Straight through to Baton Rouge.

459
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,951
We will not turn back.

460
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,755
Sorry for keeping you waiting.
Was the brandy satisfactory?

461
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,510
- Excellent. Won't you join me?
- Goodness me, no. I never touch spirits.

462
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,599
My papa taught me that a girl ought
to keep her wits about her at all times.

463
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,995
Your father raised a very smart girl.

464
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,998
You're being sweet.
Would you like to see the garden?

465
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,554
Didn't you forget your shawl?

466
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,436
Why, Lukey!

467
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:20,037
Now, Lukey, you take that tray downstairs
and go about doing what you have to do.

468
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,439
You know, I remember the first time I tried
spirits, at the Governor's Ball in Jackson.

469
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,714
My escort, Adam Lovelace from Biloxi,
well, he gave me a mint julep.

470
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,549
You know, those Lovelace boys
are all very handsome, but fast,

471
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,591
if you know what I mean.

472
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,669
If I could tell you the thoughts that went
on in my mind after that one julep... My!

473
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,190
I'd rather know the thoughts
going on in your mind right now.

474
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,915
- Kendall, what in the name of...?
- Sorry we have to interrupt.

475
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,315
Ask them what they
think your chances are

476
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,398
of blowing up Newton Station
and getting to Baton Rouge.

477
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,195
- Are you drunk?
- Unfortunately, no.

478
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,117
They were listening upstairs.

479
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,511
Makes a pretty good stethoscope.

480
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,029
Don't feel guilty.
I was slow to catch on too.

481
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,957
Where were you, Kendall?

482
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,834
Well, a gentlemen thinks twice
before peeking into a lady's bedroom,

483
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,996
but sometimes it pays off.

484
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,953
Looks like she's made
a fool out of both of us.

485
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,548
Ding-dong. Ding-dong.

486
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,954
You know something, Miss Hunter?

487
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,355
You have put me
to quite an inconvenience.

488
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,914
At least I've accomplished something, sir.

489
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,795
I don't suppose I could accept your word
of honour not to discuss this with anyone.

490
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,878
- I don't hold to honour with any Yankees.
- Exactly.

491
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,833
So the whole state of Mississippi
will be alerted.

492
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,838
So could you possibly suggest
what I should do with you?

493
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,669
I noticed she was getting on your nerves.
Now's your chance to shoot her.

494
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,634
- One more word out of you...
- Go ahead. Shoot us.

495
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,512
Shoot both of us.

496
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:05,112
But you'll never get away with your filthy,
murdering plans, Mr Colonel Marlowe.

497
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,119
You Yankees and your holy principle
about saving the Union.

498
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,437
You're plundering pirates, that's what.

499
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,711
You think there's no Confederate army
where you're going?

500
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,879
Do you think our boys
are asleep down here?

501
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,039
They'll catch up to you
and they'll cut you to pieces,

502
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,799
you nameless, fatherless scum!

503
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,516
And I wish I could be there to see it.

504
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,076
If it happens, Miss Hunter, you will be.

505
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,316
Hurry it up.

506
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,116
All right.

507
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,036
You're an excellent rider, Miss Hunter.

508
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,756
Interesting country, isn't it?

509
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,318
I'm more interested in why you vandals
confiscated my dead father's clothes.

510
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,512
Well, they're for our cadets.

511
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,676
- Scouts.
- Scouts!

512
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,791
Spies, you mean.

513
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,072
It's a wonder they don't crawl along
on their bellies like snakes.

514
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,510
You'll find out what happens
to spies down here.

515
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,394
My personal experience with spies
is limited. I've only known one.

516
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,035
Do you mind, Major?
I prefer to ride alone.

517
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,036
Ma'am.

518
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,033
Miss Hannah!

519
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,439
All right, forward! Yo-oh!

520
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,794
Back in line, Doctor.

521
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,396
(Hannah screams)

522
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,832
- These lady's drawers are almost dry.
- Yeah.

523
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,711
Aren't you getting chilly?

524
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,354
Don't tell me you're concerned
about my health.

525
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,270
If I give you back your clothes,
will you promise not to run away again?

526
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,791
I would, ma'am. There's a point
where pride becomes impractical.

527
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,913
Actually, if you could get a look
at yourself, I'd think you'd agree.

528
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,237
Very well. I do wish to keep my health.

529
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,591
- I shall not try to run away again.
- Your word of honour?

530
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,474
- My word of honour.
- To Yankees?

531
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,876
- To Yankees.
- Cross your heart?

532
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,991
- I gave you my word!
- All right, Lukey.

533
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,032
Help Miss Hunter with her clothes.

534
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,869
I'm glad you're being sensible.
You were beginning to worry me.

535
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,549
- From a medical standpoint.
- Thank you, Doctor.

536
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:41,279
I wish I could be of further assistance, but
you Southern people have your own help.

537
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,879
(Kirby) Attention! Eyes front!

538
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,470
Rebs, sir!

539
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,197
Hopping that riverbank.
A full brigade, coming fast.

540
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,710
Horse, foot and artillery, sir.
It ain't militia, neither.

541
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,717
- How far?
- Ten minutes.

542
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,674
All right, get out of sight,
get in those trees.

543
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,396
Enemy patrol. Take cover and choke up.

544
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,877
- Bugler!
- Not bugler, you idiot! Hand signals.

545
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,879
Enemy across the river.
Move out. Keep it quiet.

546
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,755
Why doesn't he stand and fight?
He's got a full brigade.

547
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,589
(rebel troops sing
"The Bonnie Blue Flag")

548
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,356
(singing continues)

549
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,993
Hurrah! Hurrah!
For Southern rights, hurrah!

550
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:21,511
Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag
That bears a single star

551
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,394
Hurrah! Hurrah!
For Southern rights, hurrah!

552
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,877
Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag
That bears a single star

553
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,116
- (horse snorts)
- Take it easy.

554
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,557
Come on, stop it.

555
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,236
(singing continues)

556
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,876
Hannah!

557
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,911
Hey! Help! Over here!

558
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,190
- (muffled scream)
- Ouch!

559
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,312
Let go with those teeth!

560
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,069
- I've got 800 men out there.
- Get some water.

561
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,074
Looks to be all clear across the river.

562
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,792
Well...

563
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,877
How many men does it take
to keep one lone female quiet?

564
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,119
Colonel, the prisoner
would like a word with you.

565
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,672
Yes, Miss Hunter?

566
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,758
I'm not here to complain
about what you did.

567
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,429
It was your duty as you saw it,
and you did it.

568
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,471
I'm sorry you had to break your word.

569
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,388
I gave my word not to run away. I didn't
give it not to cry out for assistance.

570
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,829
I suppose there's a fine point there,

571
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,713
but I have to ask you to give me
your word on that too.

572
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,832
I do that, here and now.

573
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,193
Or I suppose when I testify against you,
I'd be handicapped with a broken jaw.

574
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,675
I'd say so. Anything else, ma'am?

575
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,271
One slight item.
My constant companions there.

576
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,994
I don't know how it is up North, of course,

577
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:27,240
but down South there are times when
Southern women feel the need for privacy.

578
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,196
You two.

579
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,949
We was respectful. Real respectful, sir.

580
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:40,359
You told us it was all right just as long
as we could see the top of her head.

581
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,835
- You told them that?
- Well...

582
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,190
Then there's one more item.

583
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,517
I suggest you see a doctor.
Ding-dong. Ding-dong.

584
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,838
(gunshot)

585
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,158
Over there in that barn. Come on.

586
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,236
(gunshots)

587
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,597
- We was bushwhacked, Colonel.
- All right, smoke 'em out.

588
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,276
Hold your fire.

589
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:00,478
Hey, there! We're Confederates,
but we ain't hostile.

590
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,388
- Honest!
- Drop your weapons and come on out.

591
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,078
Yes, sir.

592
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,070
Coming.

593
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,311
Hey, Virgil, come ahead on.

594
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,516
They's real bluebellies.

595
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,596
Watch it, Colonel.

596
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,029
Just the two of us, Cap. And one captive.

597
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,872
Howdy, Cap. Jackie Jo and me is sorry
about popping away at you people.

598
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,753
We thought you was
more sheriff's deputies.

599
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,633
What have you got
against sheriff's deputies?

600
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,036
- That's a good one, huh?
- That's a slick one.

601
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,913
We just love sheriff's deputies.

602
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,955
They're deserters from the Confederacy,
sir. The lowest swine bred.

603
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:06,437
- I take it you're the sheriff?
- Captain Henry Goodbody, retired.

604
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,630
Acting sheriff of Lorena County.

605
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,876
I was about to apprehend these rats...

606
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,198
But we bushwhacked you,
you old goat, didn't we?

607
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:20,792
(Virgil) That we did, Jackie Jo.
But tell them about us, Captain Goodyo.

608
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,917
- Don't you dare touch him again!
- Miss Hunter.

609
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:32,194
You! You call yourself a man?
Treating with that scum?

610
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,356
Miss Hunter, that man is our enemy.

611
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,109
One word from you of any kind
and he will be shot. Understand?

612
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,390
That's right, Cap.

613
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,878
- Can I help you, miss?
- I'm quite capable of getting on by myself.

614
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,869
Seems you need a little attention. Doctor!
Will you look to our good friend's ear?

615
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,393
Sorry but I got a weak stomach. Otis,
see what you can do for our new recruit.

616
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,400
Hard to explain a man, isn't it?

617
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,555
Take care of this man.

618
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,830
Gunshot wound, sir.

619
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,995
Ow! You aim to stick that thing
clear through to the other side?

620
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:30,079
I seriously doubt it would have met
with any obstruction.

621
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,998
Sergeant, give me a couple
of those good cigars.

622
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,350
Ow! Hey!

623
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:39,314
- Did it hurt you, Virgil?
- This will make you feel better.

624
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,228
We'll have a talk, fellas.
Did you come through Newton Station?

625
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,397
- Sure did.
- Any troops there?

626
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,751
Not no more.
Now, the Alabama Sixth, it was there.

627
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,599
But it moved to Vicksburg
with the Georgia Tenth.

628
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,713
- The Tenth was Virg and my's old outfit.
- "Was" is right.

629
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,037
I guess there aren't any troops
within 30 or 40 miles.

630
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,720
- 60 at least.
- (sheriff) You vile traitors!

631
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,957
Vicksburg, you say?
That's where we're headed for.

632
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,310
Looks like we're in for a little fight.

633
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,991
- Thanks, fellas. Untie the sheriff.
- High on the hog, huh, Virg?

634
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,678
Hey, looks like you Yankee boys
do all right with the women.

635
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,509
(Jackie Jo) And that's a pretty
towheaded one you've got there.

636
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,471
- Hi.
- Howdy, missy.

637
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:28,149
- Hi, missy.
- See what I told you about up North?

638
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,798
- Sergeant, your gauntlets.
- A pleasure, sir.

639
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,872
(Virgil) Hi, missy. Hey, missy.

640
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,150
Remove the prisoner.

641
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:44,512
Are you going to shoot him personal,
Cap? Let Jackie Jo here do it.

642
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,995
He's the best dang shot I ever seen.

643
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,998
I once saw him shoot
a runaway negro slave woman...

644
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,270
right through the... eyes.

645
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,952
(punch)

646
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,475
Tie 'em up.

647
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:13,312
Sheriff, I'll leave them in your hands.
Pistol. It's loaded.

648
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,798
With the compliments
of Miss Hannah Hunter of Greenbriar.

649
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,714
- Thank you, sir.
- You are welcome, sir.

650
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,197
Satisfied, Miss Hunter?

651
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:30,552
Well, your sense of justice
does surprise me a little.

652
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:35,231
Justice? Those men would
have been excess baggage.

653
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:38,477
I don't trust them any more
than I really trust...

654
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,034
- Than me?
- That's right.

655
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,757
Yes, ma'am. A hard man to understand.

656
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,790
NEWTON STATION
THE RAILROAD JUNCTION

657
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,549
SUPPLYING THE CONFEDERATE
FORCES AT VICKSBURG

658
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,509
- Hi there, girls!
- Yankees! Get out of here!

659
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,870
Get out, you dirty Yankees!
Get out of here!

660
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,353
- Jonathan!
- Miss Hunter.

661
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,268
Mustn't talk to the prisoners.
We've got a nice room for you upstairs.

662
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,995
- A nice hot bath for you.
- You can change your clothes.

663
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,111
You see, we've got a lot of work to do.

664
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,550
- You're not going to burn the town?
- No. Just war supplies.

665
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:26,231
Cotton. Railway equipment.
Contraband, ma'am.

666
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,432
Contraband. That's me, ain't it?

667
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,672
Come on! Dismount!

668
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,354
- Neatly done, Richard.
- Thank you, sir.

669
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,948
- Is this the whole garrison?
- Every last man.

670
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,595
They gave up without a struggle,
like Caesar to Cleopatra.

671
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,154
Without a struggle, huh?

672
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,512
Kirby, set up headquarters
in this hotel.

673
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,279
- It would be a pleasure, sir.
- And close the bar.

674
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,154
- Yes, sir.
- Shall we set about the day's work?

675
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,551
I'm going to love setting a torch
to this nest of rebels.

676
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,876
Prisoner!

677
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,312
- Rebel colonel, sir.
- Yes, sir?

678
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,956
What is the contraband in the warehouses
and on those cars in the sidings?

679
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:32,596
The property of the Confederate States
of America is not contraband, sir.

680
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,278
Oh?

681
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,960
Well, let's look at it
from my side, Colonel.

682
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:41,153
- Jonathan! Jonny Miles.
- You know the Colonel?

683
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:47,276
Sure. We're old friends. Last time
we served together was fighting Indians.

684
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,789
Sorry about the arm.
When did that happen?

685
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,516
I want neither your solicitude
nor to recall our association.

686
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,791
Have I your permission to retire, sir?

687
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,956
Take him away.

688
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,518
I can't figure a man like Miles
giving up that easy.

689
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,074
He's West Point. Tough as nails.

690
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,112
Maybe losing that arm
took a lot out of him.

691
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:24,519
The man I knew could lose both arms
and still try to kick you to death. Hoppy?

692
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,832
- Did you picket this whole area?
- Yes, sir.

693
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:35,436
Colonel! There's a reb train coming in, sir.

694
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,676
Secord! Woodward!

695
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,353
This bar's closed.

696
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,914
(whistle of approaching train)

697
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:54,276
Well, it must be a supply train -
rolling right into our laps.

698
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,358
I never saw a supply train
without guards on it before.

699
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:00,313
They wouldn't be too alert
in their own territory.

700
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,557
- Where was that reb colonel?
- The telegraph office.

701
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,558
- Telegraph office?
- Yes, sir.

702
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,830
All right, Secord, you know what to do.

703
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,633
Get those horses under cover!

704
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,635
Get them wagons!

705
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,636
Get that bale off there. Watch it!

706
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,312
Down, out of sight.

707
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,396
Cover from inside.

708
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,715
(train whistle)

709
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,350
- Sir?
- No, I don't need it.

710
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:38,719
- Everyone's ready for action, sir.
- Thank you.

711
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,760
(gunfire)

712
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,913
Fire!

713
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,352
I didn't want this. I tried to avoid a fight.

714
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,914
That's why I took up medicine.

715
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,439
- Look at that idiot!
- Jonny! Jonny Miles!

716
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,516
Cease fire!

717
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,596
( bugle)

718
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,109
- (Kendall) All right, move him up.
- Move this man up.

719
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,638
Let me be of assistance.
I'm a physician. Dr Marvin.

720
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:24,673
Major Kendall. We appreciate your help.

721
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,518
This man is next.

722
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,591
Go get some air.

723
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,280
- I can help.
- Get out.

724
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,876
Get him out of here.

725
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,919
Lou, you go and get some ice.
All you can find.

726
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,508
You too. You help him. Quick.

727
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,516
(explosions)

728
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,439
How long are you going to be, Kendall?

729
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,790
Take a look for yourself. We just started.

730
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,674
- I need a definite answer.
- I can't give you one.

731
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:04,439
I've got a job to do too, you know.

732
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,116
At least five hours.

733
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,475
Colonel. Hey, Colonel.

734
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,588
Hello, trooper.

735
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,712
I'm Hoskins. Bud Hoskins.

736
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:24,070
K Company, sir.

737
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,794
- You don't know me.
- Sure I know you.

738
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:30,356
Good soldier. You just lie easy, son.

739
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:34,518
I put my hand on there and it's all...

740
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,670
Just lie still.

741
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:42,397
You'll write my ma, Colonel?
She'd love it if you...

742
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:46,433
You'll be writing her yourself before long.

743
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,118
No.

744
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,276
No, I know.

745
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,349
- And I'm scared, Colonel.
- There's nothing to be scared of.

746
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,636
No, I'm all right.

747
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:01,115
Just hold onto me, sir.

748
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,116
And write my ma.

749
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,030
I'll be in your debt forever.

750
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,596
Aren't you proud?

751
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,920
Yes, I'm very proud of that boy.

752
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,590
- Report.
- Three dead, 18 wounded.

753
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,872
Demolition proceeding as ordered, sir.
And the bar is closed.

754
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,956
The bar is open!

755
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:09,512
- Get some laudanum.
- There is no more, sir.

756
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,477
Come down out of there, buster,
unless you want to go up with it.

757
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:36,236
(explosion)

758
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:44,558
Well, John, there goes half a million
dollars of railroad equipment.

759
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:48,468
That's how I made my living, you know.
Building railroads.

760
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,795
(explosion)

761
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:57,478
The railroad's finished for eight miles!
North and south...

762
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,839
John, what are you doing? Wait a minute!

763
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,713
- John!
- Get out!

764
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:10,354
- You figure this is a hospital?
- Listen to me.

765
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:14,393
And I can do it to colonels, too!
Get out of here.

766
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,756
(explosion)

767
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,356
(explosion)

768
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,996
(explosions)

769
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:35,633
When we move out, give your people -
the wounded - a lot of liquor.

770
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,636
I'd do that anyway.

771
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,956
(explosions continue)

772
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,596
Here, take this.

773
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,116
It will steady you down.

774
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,233
I've never seen it this way before.

775
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:24,279
I was with my father when he died.

776
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,550
But he died peacefully.

777
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,997
- Without pain.
- Well, it was lucky.

778
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,078
- For both of you.
- (man screaming)

779
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,317
Go ahead, Kendall! Have a field day!

780
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,749
What do you mean, field day?

781
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,916
He's fighting to save men's lives.

782
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:48,431
Men's lives?
Or the reputation of his profession?

783
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:53,588
- You can't be serious, Colonel Marlowe.
- Have it your way, ma'am.

784
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:59,475
- Medicine is the most noble...
- Sure, noble profession, noble oath.

785
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:05,436
Lanterns held on high. So high
they won't admit they're groping for...

786
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,199
- You're unfair and...
- Unfair?

787
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:22,154
There was a girl not much older
than that boy in there.

788
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:25,352
I wasn't unfair then, understand?

789
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:31,555
Because they used a lot of fancy words
that a section hand wouldn't understand.

790
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:35,639
So I held her down
while two of 'em worked on her.

791
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:39,389
I trusted doctors then. Believed in 'em.

792
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,752
Because I was in love
and I didn't want to see her die.

793
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,795
A tumour, they said it was.

794
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,639
And it had to come out right away.

795
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:54,833
So they stuck a leather strap in her mouth
so she could bite off her screams

796
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,520
while they cut away to get in there.

797
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,871
And what did they find? Nothing!

798
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,913
Oh, they were sorry.
Sure, they'd made a mistake.

799
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,510
They had something to talk about
before their next experiment.

800
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,679
But what about me?
They left me begging her not to die.

801
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,756
I lost my wife.

802
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:20,838
I didn't kill either one of them.

803
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,509
I must have been crazy,
or too conventional.

804
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,435
Quite a speech.
I guess I'm feeling my liquor.

805
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,028
(shouted orders)

806
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,678
Whoo!

807
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:06,274
- Thank you, Doctor.
- You're welcome, ma'am.

808
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,996
Thanks, Hank.

809
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,278
- Well, we almost fooled you.
- Almost.

810
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,875
You'll never make it, Hank.
They're already closing in on you.

811
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,959
Bedford Forest is sniffing at your heels.

812
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:34,629
You're headed straight
for that prison at Andersonville.

813
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:39,709
There's nothing we can do
to help you there. The South is starving.

814
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,832
Jonathan, all I'm doing
is practising medicine.

815
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,633
Old ironhead does all the thinking.

816
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,638
He thinks things pretty good. West Point?

817
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,236
No, section hand.

818
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,876
- How are Susan and the kids?
- They're fine.

819
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,357
In Vicksburg.
I expect you'll be seeing them soon.

820
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:04,438
Nice try, Jonathan. Nice try.

821
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,875
See you in Vicksburg, Hoppy.

822
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:21,599
- Goodbye, Hoppy.
- Goodbye, Doctor.

823
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,678
I want to thank you for all I've learned.

824
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:28,679
I shall endeavour
to get home alive as many as I can.

825
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,756
You're a good man, Hoppy.

826
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:36,318
After this thing is all over, if we don't meet
again, be sure and finish medical school.

827
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,874
I shall make a point of it, sir.

828
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:48,473
Goodbye, Doctor. And good luck.

829
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:51,637
Thank you, Doctor, for all your help.

830
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:11,434
Vicksburg. They're headed
southwest to Baton Rouge.

831
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:14,120
Baton Rouge.

832
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:18,074
It's Baton Rouge, Major.
Tell General Forest.

833
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:35,189
(Secord) Yes, you can. I'm on the board of
inquiry. I know exactly what can be done.

834
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:38,153
Now, he has no right, even as a...

835
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,030
- Phil...
- Yes, John?

836
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:49,672
I'm sorry about what happened
back at Newton Station.

837
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:53,270
Forget it, John.
You were under a strain.

838
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:56,631
But since you brought up the subject...

839
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,320
You know, John,
I'm an older man than you are.

840
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,590
What's more, I'm a politician.

841
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:04,359
We've knocked over Newton Station.

842
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,994
It's a glorious thing on my... our records.

843
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,669
But now is the time to head north,
back to La Grange...

844
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,190
We're committed, Phil, and that's that.

845
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,118
Stubborn. Stubborn!

846
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,269
Ouch.

847
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,392
Can I have some of that liquor
to swallow, Doc?

848
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,796
You haven't got a good enough excuse.
How'd this happen, Dunker?

849
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:33,357
I was chopping down one of them
telegraph poles back there in Newton.

850
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:37,598
- The axe ricocheted right onto my leg.
- (laughter)

851
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:40,439
- Go arrest the axe.
- It ain't nothing.

852
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:45,190
Nothing, huh? Almost blood poisoning.
You're lucky I saw you limping.

853
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:46,958
Aw, Doc...

854
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:51,312
What are you putting on there? Dirt?

855
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:59,912
Tree moss. Ordinary green mould. It has
some sort of healing agent, I imagine.

856
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:04,670
- You imagine?
- I don't imagine the results, Colonel.

857
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,997
This is an old Cheyenne Indian cure.

858
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:11,999
Tsk! Cheyenne Indian cure!

859
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:15,430
Green mould! Tree moss!

860
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,156
You keep this on.
Report any soreness to me.

861
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,996
Lukey!

862
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:39,709
- What for they shoot me, Miss Hannah?
- It's all right.

863
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,876
(Kendall) Get my bag.

864
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:11,034
- She's gone, ma'am.
- Oh, no.

865
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:13,390
(sobs)

866
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:28,278
Are you all right, Miss Hannah?

867
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,358
I brought you a little bitty piece of candle.

868
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:35,029
We'll have some hot water
for you in the morning.

869
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:40,391
And lookee here. I found
a piece of looking glass for you.

870
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,436
Thank you.

871
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,749
I hope you'll... be able
to get some rest here.

872
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:19,079
You must know how we feel,
ma'am, about Lukey.

873
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:24,072
How much we regret...

874
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,156
how sorry I am...

875
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:30,350
that in some way we were the cause of...

876
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,914
Lukey isn't asking for that.

877
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,600
I wish I could let you go.

878
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,556
If I gave you a horse and let you go,

879
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:43,913
would you promise not to tell anybody
our plans for the next 24 hours?

880
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,838
It's too late.

881
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,349
It's too late for all of that.

882
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,830
No more promises.

883
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,551
No more anything now.

884
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:07,356
I'm sorry. Truly sorry.

885
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,151
Dunker.

886
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:24,196
Agh!

887
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:28,711
- That leg was all right yesterday.
- Yes, but this morning it got swolled.

888
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:32,071
- I had to tear my trouser leg.
- Where's the poultice?

889
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:36,239
It started into itching, sir,
so I just yanked her off.

890
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:39,591
It was a sign it was
beginning to heal, you fool.

891
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:44,189
Come in here, or you're in trouble.

892
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,470
Brown, lend a hand.

893
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,470
Over there.

894
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,074
- Coffee?
- Thanks.

895
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:58,876
Report.

896
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:04,790
That's Salt Springs, all right, sir.
Nary a soldier inside, neither.

897
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:09,357
Just some old women, a couple
of salt mills and a school for little boys.

898
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:14,508
- The salt mills will need burning.
- Why show ourselves? We've been lucky.

899
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:17,200
You call that coffee?

900
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:20,471
We can't pass 'em up.
Salt is as valuable as ammunition.

901
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:23,672
We'll bivouac here
and hit them in the morning.

902
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:26,030
All right, you're the boss.

903
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:34,790
(Dunker, drunk)  Hi-ho, down we go
There ain't no such word as "can't"...

904
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:39,789
- What's going on?
- The doctor's working on Dunker's leg.

905
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,876
(drunken singing)

906
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:49,716
I left my love
My love I left...

907
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,796
Take another pull.

908
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:58,674
Ah, that's good store liquor, Doc.
Who hit John?

909
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,679
- I've got to take it off, Dunker.
- What did you say?

910
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,155
I've got to take your leg off.

911
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,351
You've got to what?

912
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:12,837
The poison's gone too far.
You'll be dead by morning.

913
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:20,156
What can come of me after that, Doc?
One leg? What can come of me after that?

914
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,395
I'll rig a sling and leave you
with the closest civilian care.

915
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,192
Civilian care?

916
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:29,869
Then comes prison next, huh?
Andersonville?

917
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,468
Is that what happens to me, Doc?!

918
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,717
- Quite possibly.
- Yeah.

919
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:39,389
That's a hell of a tough choice
for a fella to have to make.

920
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:44,435
- Ain't it? Well, tell me. Ain't it?
- It's got to come off.

921
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,675
All right.

922
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,836
You just fire away.

923
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:56,954
But before you start sawing,
you give me some of that chloroform stuff.

924
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:01,632
- You put me out, Doc.
- I'll give you what I got.

925
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,436
Now bite this.
Give me a hand here. Hold him down.

926
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:28,396
God... God!

927
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,994
JEFFERSON MILITARY ACADEMY

928
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:41,358
It's obviously the column
that raided Newton Station.

929
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,516
That Vicksburg report was just a faint.

930
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:46,871
I thought a brigade of cavalry
was due here.

931
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:52,120
- They won't get here till late today, sir.
- What you suggest is most extreme.

932
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:55,471
- My oldest boy here is only 16.
- Damn it, sir!

933
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,751
I beg your pardon, Colonel.
I mean, Reverend...

934
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:04,159
Look, I've got a boy in my battery that's
14, a man that's 72. This is a war, sir.

935
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:09,479
I could start lobbing shrapnel and grape
at them critters, catch 'em napping.

936
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:15,118
Just a show of force, then perhaps we can
hold them off until the cavalry gets here.

937
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,231
- Cadet Major Barksdale.
- Sir?

938
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:20,511
Assemble your battalion.
The entire complement.

939
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,915
Taylor and Fitcher have the mumps.

940
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,993
Scratch them from the duty roster.
Well, you heard the Lieutenant.

941
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:31,192
You'll be pleased to inform the corps
we shall move at dawn.

942
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,276
Thank you, sir!

943
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,556
(cock crows)

944
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:56,596
Attention!

945
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:08,669
Cadet Major Barksdale, you may move
your column forward. And God bless you.

946
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,308
Right shoulder, arms!

947
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,796
Right, face!

948
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:23,512
Cadets, forward march!

949
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:35,509
Reverend, my boy Johnny.
He's all I've got left.

950
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:40,316
First his pa, then his uncles,
his brothers. Now him?

951
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:45,719
He's all I have left, Reverend.
I'm not going to let him go.

952
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:48,912
Cadet drummer Buford,
you are relieved of duty.

953
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,510
(boy squealing)

954
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,718
I'd save a little of that for Dunker.

955
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,836
I just lost him.

956
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,396
You lost Dunker, eh?

957
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,676
Well, you lost us a good man.

958
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:50,236
Blood poisoning. Amputation.
A shock to the heart, I guess.

959
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:54,114
- I wouldn't have had to amputate if he'd...
- lf, maybe, perhaps.

960
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:57,755
- What's the matter, medicine man?
- Section hand, I've had you!

961
01:28:57,880 --> 01:28:59,836
Strip your blouse!

962
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:11,072
I think you're right. Come on.

963
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:15,318
Orderly! Horses! Bring 'em up!

964
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,516
Johnny!

965
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:30,992
Johnny Buford!

966
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:33,033
Johnny!

967
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:55,999
- What are the rules, Colonel?
- Just make up your own.

968
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,236
You said no rules, Colonel.

969
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:09,948
On your feet, croaker.

970
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,916
Fire Peter!

971
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,916
Fire Paul!

972
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:43,676
Fire Paul!

973
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:52,751
Artillery fire, sir. Hidden battery.

974
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:07,400
Those are nothing but children.
Schoolboys.

975
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:12,036
- Just some kids from the military school.
- But they keep coming.

976
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:23,515
Sound assembly.

977
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:25,596
( bugle)

978
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,440
At least that Holy Joe ain't no kid.

979
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:57,196
(shouted orders)

980
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:05,712
Halt! Front rank, kneel!

981
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,078
- Ready!
- Miss Hunter...

982
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:11,953
Aim! Fire!

983
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:22,797
Rear rank, halt!

984
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:24,512
Kneel!

985
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:28,076
Ready! Aim! Fire!

986
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,228
What do you want to do?
Set up a field hospital?

987
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:38,555
Yes, what are you going to do now?

988
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:42,355
With all due respect,
I'm going to get the hell out of here.

989
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,436
Sound recall!

990
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:50,873
I told you to take care of this woman!

991
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,468
(explosion)

992
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:57,275
Colonel, I got me a prisoner.
What do you want me to do with him?

993
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:00,358
- Spank him.
- On the bottom?

994
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,436
Where do you think?

995
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,116
- Halt!
- Hold it, Colonel.

996
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:55,317
- Report.
- Rebs. They got the whole road blocked.

997
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:58,159
- How many?
- A full regiment of regulars, sir.

998
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:01,989
They got two pieces of artillery
and they're digging in along the road.

999
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:11,275
The only thing to do is fight our way back
to Salt Springs and head east.

1000
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:16,190
- Haven't you seen that dust?
- Cavalry. Following us for three hours.

1001
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:21,792
Colonel, the deacon says he knows this
country real good. Don't you, Deacon?

1002
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:26,277
Preaching the gospel, singing the praises
of the Lord hereabouts for years.

1003
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:29,358
It might be a good idea
to start praying right now.

1004
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:33,678
The deacon smuggled runaway slaves
north out of here through the swamp.

1005
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:39,397
- With the underground railway.
- Could you smuggle us out south?

1006
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,909
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1007
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:45,157
Why, that swamp is full
of quicksand, rattlers...

1008
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,953
The Garden of Eden
had its sufferance too.

1009
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:53,916
Follow me, brother Colonel, through
the swamps all the way to the river Amite.

1010
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:56,315
Lead kindly, Lord.

1011
01:34:56,440 --> 01:35:00,479
All right, get yourself
a couple of fresh horses.

1012
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:04,633
By the right flank, take cover.

1013
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:24,876
Come on!

1014
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,871
(shouts)

1015
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,830
(Marlowe) Come on! Come on!

1016
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:45,635
Move out. Come on, boy.

1017
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:50,116
Come on, boy.

1018
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:53,438
Keep moving! Keep moving! Come on!

1019
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:59,589
Keep moving. Stay awake there, kid.

1020
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:03,076
Keep moving. Pick up your feet.

1021
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:06,237
John, how far do you figure
to Baton Rouge?

1022
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:07,793
40 miles.

1023
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,876
Keep alive in there!

1024
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,151
- You want me to apologise now or later?
- For what?

1025
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:16,511
- Keep moving!
- I never thought you could do it.

1026
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:20,997
You know, John, I've given up
all thought of running for Congress.

1027
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:24,396
With this on my record,
by George, I can be Governor.

1028
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:26,795
- Keep moving!
- Governor of Michigan.

1029
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:30,196
And you can name your own job.
Railroad commissioner...

1030
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:34,996
Don't start making campaign promises
till we get there. Join your regiment.

1031
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:38,756
Colonel, my duty, medically speaking,
is to inform you

1032
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:41,713
that these men may make it
on their hands and knees.

1033
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:44,957
We've been 20 hours without a stop.
We need a rest.

1034
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:46,832
I've got eyes, Kendall.

1035
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:50,316
It's also my duty to inform you
that if we run into a fight...

1036
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:52,908
That is all, Doctor.

1037
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:54,996
Thank you, sir.

1038
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:26,556
Column, halt!

1039
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:34,470
- Woodward.
- Yo!

1040
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:38,034
First squad,
scout the other side of the bridge.

1041
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:41,675
First squad, forward, yo!

1042
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:48,470
(hooves clatter on bridge)

1043
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:02,840
I don't know if you've heard.

1044
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:07,192
Your people are about an hour
behind us, coming fast.

1045
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:09,914
I've heard.

1046
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:14,591
We're going on to Baton Rouge.
We'll leave you here.

1047
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:18,834
Your own kind can take care of you.

1048
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:22,236
- I'm sure they can.
- Yes.

1049
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,156
I...

1050
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:31,598
I'm sorry for the hardship and...

1051
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:38,596
the humiliation that we've...
that I've caused you.

1052
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:40,676
(gunshots)

1053
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:51,836
Get her out of here!

1054
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:57,436
Recall!

1055
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:59,516
( bugle)

1056
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:04,116
Get her in that cabin!

1057
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:13,036
Come on, Miss Hannah.

1058
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:25,873
Looks like they've got us in a trap.

1059
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:31,998
Knock on it!

1060
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:41,036
Give us some cover!

1061
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,036
Captain Woodward, move!

1062
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:56,996
(gunfire continues)

1063
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:07,276
Leave me alone.

1064
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:10,551
I'm all right. Let me alone, would you?

1065
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:22,198
Easy.

1066
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:26,393
Get Colonel Secord right away.
Not that way, the other door.

1067
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:30,479
- Report.
- It's alive with rebs. At least two cannons.

1068
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:33,398
- They jumped us so quick.
- Infantry?

1069
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:36,273
- The wood's full of 'em.
- Join your troop.

1070
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:39,710
- Cut his boot off, Sam.
- Nobody's cutting that boot off.

1071
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:41,796
Cut his boot off.

1072
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:48,116
Take a good stiff jolt.

1073
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,878
Those are $20 boots, trooper.

1074
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,116
- Get some water.
- Who, me?

1075
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:10,514
Take A-troop and that reverend,
or whatever he is.

1076
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:16,158
Find a ford someway across that river.
Flank 'em. Take a bugler with you.

1077
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:19,636
Sir, thank you for the opportunity.

1078
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,951
John, it's a trap.
They want us to cross that bridge.

1079
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:06,355
It'd be like going through a funnel.

1080
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:13,192
In a position like this, there's nothing
disgraceful about honourable surrender.

1081
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:17,518
Get back to your troop.
Keep 'em under cover.

1082
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:21,189
- You mean... you're going on?
- Get out of here!

1083
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:25,594
You're not going far with that bullet in you.

1084
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:30,157
You're taking your own sweet time
about cutting it out of there.

1085
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:34,512
You're not the only wounded man
here, Colonel. Get me my bag.

1086
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:37,473
Now, this is going to hurt a little.

1087
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:41,318
Go on with it, Kendall.

1088
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:44,352
- Ooh!
- Keep that leg stretched.

1089
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:48,396
Probe, please.

1090
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:11,830
(Marlowe yelps)

1091
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:16,396
Are you having fun?

1092
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:26,116
You're lucky.

1093
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:37,112
You may not believe it, Colonel,
but I bought you some time.

1094
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:41,358
- A couple of hours?
- Maybe more.

1095
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:44,032
Thanks.

1096
01:44:55,960 --> 01:45:01,557
- First Michigan in position, sir.
- First Illinois in position. We were first.

1097
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:04,636
I'm all right.

1098
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:14,676
Get cracking.

1099
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:39,108
God Almighty. Here he comes.

1100
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:44,676
Mount up.

1101
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:48,354
You heard me, Kirby. Mount up.

1102
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:51,790
You heard the Colonel! Mount up!

1103
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:10,871
Colonel.

1104
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,152
The deacon found a place to ford.
The men ought to be in position by now.

1105
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:20,149
Thanks. Cover our rear.
See how much time we've got.

1106
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:22,236
Yes, sir.

1107
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:38,828
- Where's your horse?
- Back in the swamp, sir.

1108
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:45,354
- Lips dry?
- Yes, sir. But my bugle ain't.

1109
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:52,709
- Uncase the colours.
- You heard him.

1110
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:08,111
- You know your orders?
- You're not fit. Let me lead this charge.

1111
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:11,835
With a success like this,
I could land in the White House.

1112
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:14,633
- We'll probably all land in the...
- (gunfire)

1113
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:17,274
Get back to your regiment!

1114
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:19,755
Bugler, sound charge!

1115
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:23,436
( bugle)

1116
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,833
Forwards! Fire Paul.

1117
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:54,276
Company!

1118
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:00,751
You're hurt, sir.

1119
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:03,394
Blow... Trumpet, blow.

1120
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:22,996
They can't give up.

1121
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:27,919
Maybe it's crazy, maybe it's brave.
Don't ask me to explain it. Nobody can.

1122
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:31,191
Come on, we're going to have
a lot of work to do.

1123
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:42,156
Bugler, sound recall.

1124
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:54,430
Got any more?

1125
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:59,868
Come on, give us some more.

1126
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:10,318
How much longer, Sergeant?
Sergeant Major.

1127
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:14,672
- Pretty near ready, sir.
- All right, boys! Hurry it up! Lay it in!

1128
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:16,756
Knock on it!

1129
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:30,270
Come on out! Get out of there!

1130
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:36,757
- Can those men be moved?
- They're all critical.

1131
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,269
- May I speak to them?
- I'd rather you didn't.

1132
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:42,756
They've got to be quiet.
I've given them all the laudanum I have.

1133
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:46,316
It's a lousy finish for good men.

1134
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:49,398
There'll be a medic with that reb column.
Get your horse.

1135
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:52,080
I can't count on that.

1136
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:54,236
You mean you're staying?

1137
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:57,591
- Medicine's where you find it.
- Even in Andersonville?

1138
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:59,676
Even in Andersonville.

1139
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:06,075
I wouldn't blame you if you slap it away.
Shake hands?

1140
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:11,512
- Doctor, Major Gray.
- All right, coming.

1141
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:14,108
When your next doctor
takes that bandage off...

1142
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:16,549
I know. Tree moss.

1143
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:18,716
So longer, croaker.

1144
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:20,990
Take care, section hand.

1145
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:50,152
You're tired. You've helped a lot.
Thanks for it.

1146
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:55,871
A poor way of being grateful
after what I've put you through.

1147
01:51:56,920 --> 01:52:01,869
- You'd better be going.
- Yes, I guess I'd better.

1148
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:07,273
Look, Hannah Hunter.

1149
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:11,154
Thank God I won't be the cause
of hurting you any more.

1150
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:14,511
Because it happens I'm in love with you.

1151
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:18,476
( distant bugle)

1152
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:21,637
Tell her the rest when you get back.

1153
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:56,239
- One of your own, sir.
- Get going.

1154
01:52:56,360 --> 01:52:58,920
Colonel, they're right on my tail.

1155
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:27,670
(Marlowe) Let's go.

1156
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:03,109
Doctor, could our regimental surgeon
be of any service to you?

1157
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:05,196
I'd be grateful.
