1
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,758
<i>Where's it all begin?</i>

2
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,460
<i>Violence. The gun.</i>

3
00:01:01,493 --> 00:01:03,463
<i>- Isabelle!
-The knife.</i>

4
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:04,864
<i>The axe.</i>

5
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:07,233
<i>- Isabelle, come here.
- How's it born?</i>

6
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:09,201
<i>How's it start?</i>

7
00:01:09,234 --> 00:01:11,570
<i>We all just wanna make it.</i>

8
00:01:11,603 --> 00:01:13,338
<i>To live. To exist.</i>

9
00:01:13,371 --> 00:01:16,475
<i>Stay out of the hoosegow.</i>

10
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:19,478
<i>We love if we're lucky.</i>

11
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:22,481
<i>We lose, we're damaged.
Hardened.</i>

12
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:24,150
Isabelle.

13
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:26,352
<i>We do what we have to.</i>

14
00:01:26,385 --> 00:01:28,688
<i>What we are compelled to do.</i>

15
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:32,325
Not true. I like Sidney
on account of his small prick.

16
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:35,328
- Like a little mushroom.
- Easiest coin I ever earned.

17
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:38,331
Barely even know it's in;
don't matter which hole.

18
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,533
He's a disgusting little man.

19
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:42,268
With a perfect little prick.

20
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:44,436
Try not to talk
so much like a whore.

21
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:46,638
Try not to talk so much
like a bitch.

22
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:50,742
- I got a bad itch this week.
- It's those fat railway fucks.

23
00:01:50,775 --> 00:01:52,811
Dirtiest pricks
in the entire county.

24
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,400
Hey!

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,100
<b>OUTLAWS AND ANGELS
Subrip: Pix</b>

26
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:22,709
Wait! Please, no!

27
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:30,649
Grab the goddamn bag,
goddammit!

28
00:02:35,486 --> 00:02:38,625
Don't shoot!

29
00:02:46,497 --> 00:02:48,167
C'mon, don't dillydally!

30
00:02:56,908 --> 00:03:00,479
You! Get outta there, kid!

31
00:03:24,302 --> 00:03:27,639
Samuel! Get up here
and thread this mark.

32
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:37,682
What do you think?

33
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:39,318
They pretty far shucked.

34
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,520
And I got these old eyes.

35
00:03:41,552 --> 00:03:44,424
Sam, you slower than molasses
in January.

36
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:59,771
How the fuck these pricks
get the bulge on a lawman?

37
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:02,641
We was just making a deposit,
is all.

38
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,644
A deposit.

39
00:04:04,676 --> 00:04:06,412
I wasn't ready.

40
00:04:06,444 --> 00:04:08,647
Mayor Bishop is dead.

41
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,850
Goddammit!

42
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,419
Bled out real fast.

43
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:15,520
Fuck all.

44
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:21,826
Post the bounties,

45
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,330
then get Josiah on it.

46
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:27,966
Top coin.
I don't give a shit how much.

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,336
Just get it done.

48
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:18,518
Josiah?

49
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,723
They dragged him off
somewhere.

50
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:25,724
No time to bury him.

51
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:30,129
Mayhap I should have the men
start peeking for the body?

52
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:32,997
Yeah, Have them round it up,
chop off the top.

53
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:35,634
If he sees fit,
he can keep the coin.

54
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,902
I don't care.
We gotta keep heading south.

55
00:05:37,935 --> 00:05:40,638
Don't wanna give them
any time to breathe.

56
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:43,943
We slag any longer,
we're going to lose the track.

57
00:05:46,077 --> 00:05:47,912
Boys, saddle up.

58
00:05:47,946 --> 00:05:50,816
We ain't but a half day
behind 'em.

59
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:53,752
I ain't used my axe in a while,

60
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:57,790
and I'd be lyin' if I said
I wasn't looking forward to it.

61
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:32,924
Charlie, what you playing at?

62
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,799
Bang, bang, bang.

63
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,605
- Look like hell, boy.
- Yeah, we're here, ain't we?

64
00:06:46,637 --> 00:06:50,008
- The worst is comin' soon.
- Shut your yap.

65
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,810
Boys'll be fine.
Be prepared, is all.

66
00:06:51,843 --> 00:06:53,512
Sure is good to see you,
Aunt Esther.

67
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:55,213
You ain't aged a day.

68
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:58,984
I don't like it one bit what
you boys got yourselves into.

69
00:06:59,016 --> 00:07:01,019
Shut your yap!

70
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:04,823
Don't listen to her, Charlie.
She don't know nothin'.

71
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,126
You better keep your hands
off that lady.

72
00:07:07,158 --> 00:07:10,062
It's fine, boys.
I don't make no habit,

73
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:13,499
but a woman needs discipline
at the proper time.

74
00:07:13,531 --> 00:07:16,734
Just hand over the supplies,
we'll be on our way.

75
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:18,503
No need to bulldoze, son.

76
00:07:18,536 --> 00:07:22,173
Me and Esther came
and done this on our own accord.

77
00:07:22,206 --> 00:07:25,043
I didn't come nowhere
on nobody's own accord.

78
00:07:26,177 --> 00:07:29,148
I think all y'all
be on-the-shoot.

79
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,851
All y'all gonna have to answer
to the Good Lord soon.

80
00:07:32,884 --> 00:07:34,687
Shut your yap!

81
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:39,224
Now you listen here, old man.

82
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:42,661
I'm big bug around here.
No, no! Let him be!

83
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:46,165
You try that again, I'm gonna
clean your plow real good.

84
00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:49,201
You understand?
Henry, he can't breathe.

85
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,743
I'm fine, woman, I'm fine!

86
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:02,080
Well?

87
00:08:02,113 --> 00:08:03,748
Hey!

88
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,887
You're gonna wanna go down
on the east side,

89
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,055
through Rock Canyon...

90
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:12,224
and White Sands.

91
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:14,192
Cross over outside of El Paso.

92
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:15,927
West trail's better.

93
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:18,663
Through Deming,
cross in Columbus.

94
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:21,266
Ain't nothing on the east side
from here to the border.

95
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,067
We'll dies.
Exactly.

96
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,237
Ain't nobody dumb enough
to track you that way.

97
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:28,206
Who says they're tracking?

98
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,242
There a bounty on your heads.

99
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:33,177
Eight thousand, all in.

100
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:36,148
- You're joshin'.
- I wish I was,

101
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:39,018
for my nephew's sake,
but I ain't.

102
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,288
That man y'all shot, he died.

103
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,089
Government official.

104
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:46,291
Right and proper
from another county.

105
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,160
Bad luck!

106
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:50,929
He was a friend
of Sheriff Mckay.

107
00:08:50,962 --> 00:08:53,698
They was compadres.
Dammit all to hell!

108
00:08:53,731 --> 00:08:56,935
I told you not to shoot that...
Hobble your lip, Charlie.

109
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,804
And that poor young woman,
too.

110
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:02,141
We didn't kill no woman.

111
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:03,641
That's a lie.

112
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:06,277
You see how cruel you is?

113
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:08,180
You didn't even notice!

114
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:14,052
- Two-thousand each?
- Thousand on each of the boys.

115
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,087
The rest is on you.

116
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,855
They don't know us.

117
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:19,625
No way they could.

118
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:23,262
Tall man with the ivory grips
is what they call you.

119
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:25,597
And the... the fat man.

120
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,365
Who's the fat man?

121
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,168
Masks don't cover all it up.

122
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,038
If they don't catch you now,
you be alright.

123
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:35,240
They don't know your faces,

124
00:09:35,273 --> 00:09:38,110
but they gonna
come at you hard,

125
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:41,047
especially you,
until you're good and gone.

126
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,617
- East trail it is.
- Horses can't make it.

127
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,251
We can't carry enough water...

128
00:09:47,284 --> 00:09:49,288
If they die, we'll foot it.

129
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:51,889
You can't foot
if you can't drink.

130
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:53,625
Well...

131
00:09:53,658 --> 00:09:56,361
let's hope that don't happen
till the final stretch.

132
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:59,064
Plenty of green patches
on the other side.

133
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,014
Fuck all, Henry!

134
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,716
Man,
you done fucked the rooster.

135
00:10:19,717 --> 00:10:21,353
Dammit all to hell!

136
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:25,223
No...

137
00:10:25,256 --> 00:10:26,924
Sorry, ma'am.

138
00:10:26,957 --> 00:10:28,860
I truly am.

139
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:31,196
Goddammit, Henry,

140
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:33,733
you can't shoot no woman.

141
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:38,203
Joe.

142
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:40,139
Joe! Joe!

143
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,007
Don't you do it,

144
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,908
you fuckin' cow head.

145
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:53,117
My kin!
They's my goddamn kin!

146
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,086
You done crossed the line.

147
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,392
You know as well as I do,
$8,000's enough to turn anyone.

148
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:03,328
Even kin, Henry. Even kin.

149
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:18,977
Alright,
hand it to your sister.

150
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:21,245
But I wanna do it again, Papa.

151
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:23,381
Now, Charlotte,
let's give a turn.

152
00:11:23,414 --> 00:11:26,117
- Papa!
- Don't talk back to me, girl.

153
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:43,302
Well! I'll be.

154
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:47,004
All youse good at
is boy things, you ugly rut.

155
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:48,774
Hush up.

156
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:50,975
I'll fetch more rounds.

157
00:12:16,467 --> 00:12:18,437
You disgusting bitch.

158
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,340
You got clitchy chuck
all over my fingers.

159
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:27,346
Get up.

160
00:12:35,486 --> 00:12:37,355
You alright, Button?

161
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,192
Alright, then.

162
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,765
Hey, now.

163
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:50,302
Never, ever point a gun
at somebody

164
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:53,004
unless you intend
to bed 'em down.

165
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,039
You bitch, I dare you.

166
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:59,878
Florence Ethel Tildon!

167
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,480
You put that gun down at once,

168
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:06,051
or you're gonna get a whoopin'
like you've never had.

169
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,422
I was just kiddin', Daddy.

170
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,525
- Flo, you go to your daddy now.
- I'll go.

171
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,627
You best get in there,
give your daddy a rubdown

172
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,430
before supper
unless you want a whippin'.

173
00:17:11,462 --> 00:17:13,197
- I'll go, Mama.
- Hush now, Charlotte.

174
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,200
It's Flo's turn.
But she got to-

175
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:18,102
- No buts. You do as you're
told and shut it.

176
00:17:18,135 --> 00:17:20,172
Let her go, Mama.
I don't want...

177
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:22,774
No buts for you either,
young lady! Now git!

178
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:31,049
That's a good girl.

179
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:51,336
These bodies been out here
a lot longer than I like.

180
00:17:55,173 --> 00:17:57,776
Josie.
There's something over yonder.

181
00:17:57,808 --> 00:17:59,677
In the bushes.

182
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,647
Ahem.

183
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:05,350
Alright.

184
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:09,621
Whoever you be,
I implore you, reveal yourself.

185
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:11,455
We ain't gonna hurt you,

186
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:14,358
long as you come out slow-like.

187
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:18,529
Last chance.

188
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,376
What's your name, little girl?

189
00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:35,379
Don't be scared. C'mere.

190
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:38,716
All's good now.

191
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:41,353
What's your name?

192
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:43,221
Lulu.

193
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:47,358
Well...

194
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,193
that's a pretty name.

195
00:18:49,227 --> 00:18:50,762
Lulu.

196
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:54,698
What happened out here?

197
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:56,934
And who are you
to those folks?

198
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:59,904
My Grammy and Grampy
got shot good.

199
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:03,909
- Yeah. Who shot 'em, honey?
- I couldn't see them good,

200
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,778
but I could hear them.
Bad men.

201
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,846
Yeah, bad men.

202
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,718
Now, do you know why the bad men
wanted to shoot your grandfolks?

203
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,586
Not sure.

204
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:18,222
I thought they were good
at first,

205
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:21,726
and just getting Grampy
'cause he beat on us, but...

206
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:23,694
But what, honey?

207
00:19:23,728 --> 00:19:26,198
But then they bed down
Grammy.

208
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,334
And that ain't right.
I loved my Grammy.

209
00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:32,636
When I heard them do that,
I sunk down in the brush.

210
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,673
I prayed Jesus
till they went away.

211
00:19:34,705 --> 00:19:38,609
They did. But then the horses
run off and I was stuck.

212
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:39,877
I can ride.

213
00:19:39,911 --> 00:19:42,780
If the horses was here,
I could've!

214
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:46,250
Now, I know this is hard,
Lulu, but...

215
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:48,887
I need to know
what those men said.

216
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,890
They said a lot of bad words
I shouldn't say.

217
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:53,592
No, not like that.

218
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,327
I need to know
where they went.

219
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,698
They said they was going east,
through White Sands.

220
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,600
- That's impossible.
- That's what they said!

221
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,903
I ain't lying!
No... that makes sense.

222
00:20:05,936 --> 00:20:08,240
They know
we'd have to be cracked

223
00:20:08,272 --> 00:20:09,940
to follow 'em down these parts.

224
00:20:09,973 --> 00:20:11,909
Well, I ain't cracked.

225
00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:14,413
Ain't no coin worth that.

226
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,786
Goddamn.

227
00:20:21,818 --> 00:20:25,490
What you get for talking
out your neck, yellow scamp.

228
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,565
Sorry, Lulu.

229
00:20:33,597 --> 00:20:36,334
It's okay. He had it comin'.

230
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:39,403
Yeah. Now, we're gonna have
the yellow man

231
00:20:39,436 --> 00:20:42,806
take the girl back to town,
we'll push on.

232
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,643
Boss...

233
00:20:44,675 --> 00:20:47,346
maybe we should think
about this.

234
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:49,947
I thought about it.

235
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,651
I think you oughta get
on your fucking horse,

236
00:20:52,683 --> 00:20:53,985
we'll go get some heads.

237
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:13,672
I'm starting to wonder
if we's dead and gone to hell.

238
00:21:13,704 --> 00:21:14,972
Left rung...

239
00:21:15,006 --> 00:21:16,975
firebug...

240
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:18,843
snatch... wart.

241
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,680
You go and you get the pillow.

242
00:21:21,712 --> 00:21:24,682
What the hell
you yappin' about?

243
00:21:24,715 --> 00:21:27,985
Build it! Build it strong
with the logger and the roots,

244
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:29,788
big John!

245
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,555
You okay, Maddie?

246
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,992
Probably too late
to save myself from the fire,

247
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:36,995
but I'm gonna die tryin'.

248
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:39,564
Hallelujah
and praise Jesus.

249
00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:43,534
You mind your place.

250
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:45,836
I was just joshin'.

251
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:47,905
I wasn't.

252
00:21:48,905 --> 00:21:50,709
Need some water, boys.

253
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:53,010
I'm hungry, goddammit.

254
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:56,915
Sun up, sundown
and back again with no eats.

255
00:21:58,048 --> 00:22:01,586
- Steak'd be nice.
- Now he's joshin'.

256
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:10,761
Henry?

257
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,070
He gone.

258
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,074
Almost.

259
00:22:23,074 --> 00:22:25,576
Whole side of his head's rotten.

260
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:28,579
Yeah, well,
better him than us.

261
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,449
I didn't mind him.

262
00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:33,718
I'm not gonna talk ill
of the dead,

263
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,054
but I didn't care
for him much anyway.

264
00:22:36,086 --> 00:22:39,057
You just spoke ill of a dead,
Charlie.

265
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:41,092
Shut the fuck up, Joe.

266
00:22:43,961 --> 00:22:46,964
He's not quite dead yet,
but he's almost there.

267
00:22:47,964 --> 00:22:49,600
Put him out?

268
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,636
Pfft! Waste of a good round,
if you ask me.

269
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:55,906
Well, that ain't nice at all.

270
00:23:25,502 --> 00:23:27,505
Goddammit!

271
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:31,676
You happy now?!

272
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,278
I gots to have eats, Henry.

273
00:24:41,311 --> 00:24:43,881
What we needs is some whores.

274
00:24:43,914 --> 00:24:45,549
No eats and you might die.

275
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:48,186
If we die,
whores won't gonna matter.

276
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:50,522
- You're a smart one, kid.
- That's real funny.

277
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:53,725
Henry might as well dropped
a pile a shit in your mouth.

278
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,860
Shut your yap, Charlie.
I'll kills ya dead.

279
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:57,996
I'll make you a goner,
you dirty halfwit.

280
00:24:58,028 --> 00:24:59,663
Hobble your lips.

281
00:24:59,696 --> 00:25:01,765
Can't go much farther
without horses, Henry.

282
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:04,568
My foot's swole
and these bags is like lead.

283
00:25:04,602 --> 00:25:06,238
Back.

284
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:09,240
Get down.

285
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:17,249
Well, I'll be.

286
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:20,919
That ain't no town, Henry.

287
00:25:20,951 --> 00:25:22,586
Nope.

288
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:24,755
Town can't be too far.

289
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:27,592
Gotta get their congregation
somewhere.

290
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:29,627
They might have eats.

291
00:25:31,261 --> 00:25:33,130
They'll have eats.

292
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:36,134
And they'll have horses.

293
00:25:38,635 --> 00:25:40,271
Alright, boys.

294
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:43,575
We hit 'em at dark.

295
00:26:03,627 --> 00:26:05,996
- Cackleberries?
- Yes, dear.

296
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:20,144
No, no. That'll do just fine.

297
00:26:20,176 --> 00:26:22,012
- Charlotte?
- Yes, please.

298
00:26:23,681 --> 00:26:25,149
Florence?

299
00:26:25,182 --> 00:26:26,851
Can't handle
no more cackleberries.

300
00:26:26,884 --> 00:26:29,019
Any more cackleberries
is the proper way, Florence.

301
00:26:29,053 --> 00:26:31,155
I know, Mama,
but Daddy always says it.

302
00:26:31,188 --> 00:26:33,257
Do as I say, not as I do,
girl.

303
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:34,791
Yes, Papa.

304
00:26:34,825 --> 00:26:36,760
You acts like you all big
and smart,

305
00:26:36,794 --> 00:26:38,363
but you can't even
says it right.

306
00:26:38,395 --> 00:26:40,330
- Leave me alone, sissy.
- I'll leave you alone

307
00:26:40,364 --> 00:26:42,165
when I want to,
you dirty whore.

308
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:43,768
Hey, now!

309
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,336
Watch your language,
young lady!

310
00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:48,372
She should get a soap mouth
for saying that curse.

311
00:26:48,405 --> 00:26:51,174
Only dumb ugly girls like you
get soap mouths.

312
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:53,378
Hey! Cut it out now!

313
00:26:54,711 --> 00:26:57,348
One more word
and I will get the stick.

314
00:27:01,018 --> 00:27:03,254
Please say grace, Georgie.

315
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:12,230
Come, Lord Jesus,
be our guest,

316
00:27:12,262 --> 00:27:15,332
and let these gifts to us
be blessed.

317
00:27:15,365 --> 00:27:17,134
Amen.

318
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:18,936
Amen.

319
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:27,144
Tastes real nice, Mama.

320
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,280
Well, thank you, honey.

321
00:27:29,313 --> 00:27:31,215
Yep, mighty nice.

322
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:33,718
Are we gonna have milk
again soon?

323
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,353
Cow looks bony.

324
00:27:35,385 --> 00:27:39,257
Can't figure if it's old age
or just not enough feed.

325
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:41,893
The good Lord
will always get us through.

326
00:27:41,925 --> 00:27:44,028
Just testing us, that's all.

327
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,664
Yep, testing us good.

328
00:27:48,766 --> 00:27:51,069
In all that plagues us
in this world,

329
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:52,437
all the darkness,

330
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,306
there will always a little God
to find.

331
00:27:56,807 --> 00:27:59,443
And it's a beauty to behold.
Praise Jesus.

332
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:01,780
Praise Jesus.

333
00:28:07,284 --> 00:28:10,088
Hold on. Hold on now.
Stop eating right quick.

334
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,355
Mama, I'm hungry.
Can I please just finish...

335
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:14,825
Your mana's feelin'
the Holy Spirit now, Flo.

336
00:28:14,858 --> 00:28:17,327
Ain't no way to plan
for when it comes.

337
00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:19,764
Here it is.

338
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:22,500
"He causeth the grass
to grow for the cattle,

339
00:28:22,532 --> 00:28:24,901
"and herb for the service
of man,

340
00:28:24,934 --> 00:28:28,071
"that he may bring forth food
out of the earth,

341
00:28:28,105 --> 00:28:31,275
and wine that maketh glad
the heart of men..."

342
00:28:31,307 --> 00:28:33,877
Well, that's for some men,

343
00:28:33,911 --> 00:28:37,181
in the biblical times.
Not for you, Georgie.

344
00:28:37,213 --> 00:28:39,817
- 'Course not.
- Nor for you girls.

345
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:43,120
I reckon that's stated proper,
'cause it says men, not women.

346
00:28:43,153 --> 00:28:45,923
Women ain't allowed
to do nothing in that book.

347
00:28:45,955 --> 00:28:48,291
Back in those times,
back in those times,

348
00:28:48,325 --> 00:28:50,294
drink was different.

349
00:28:50,326 --> 00:28:52,296
Now it's the whiskey,

350
00:28:52,328 --> 00:28:54,331
got the devil in it.

351
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,436
The devil's work.

352
00:28:58,469 --> 00:29:02,140
The devil's work is not right.

353
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:04,342
It's not right.

354
00:29:06,143 --> 00:29:07,812
Sweetheart...

355
00:29:07,845 --> 00:29:10,148
don't get yourself
all worked up.

356
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:11,482
It's gotta stop.

357
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:15,952
Go on there,
read us the rest.

358
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:17,922
Yes, of course.

359
00:29:17,954 --> 00:29:19,990
"Thou makest darkness,
and it is night,

360
00:29:20,023 --> 00:29:22,959
"wherein all the beasts
of the forest do creep forth.

361
00:29:22,992 --> 00:29:25,061
"The young lions roar
after their prey,

362
00:29:25,095 --> 00:29:27,464
and seek their meat from God!"

363
00:29:27,498 --> 00:29:29,467
They seek their meat,

364
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,002
they seek their meat from He,

365
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,337
God, Him.

366
00:29:34,371 --> 00:29:37,441
Only He can bring us the grass
for the cow.

367
00:29:37,473 --> 00:29:40,577
Only he can bring healing
to the town

368
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:43,447
and steady congregation to us
once again.

369
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,085
We do the work, but He decides.

370
00:29:48,051 --> 00:29:49,886
You must always remember that.

371
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,923
Always, Mama.

372
00:29:51,955 --> 00:29:55,025
Be thankful,
no matter how dark the time.

373
00:29:55,058 --> 00:29:56,560
And worship.

374
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,362
Praise Jesus.

375
00:29:58,394 --> 00:30:00,198
Praise Jesus.

376
00:30:14,545 --> 00:30:16,914
You may eat.

377
00:30:32,262 --> 00:30:34,531
Go! Go!

378
00:30:34,565 --> 00:30:36,968
Hoo!

379
00:30:39,936 --> 00:30:41,572
Well, I'll be.

380
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,475
Dinnertime.

381
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:47,110
Back in your chair, ma'am.

382
00:30:50,446 --> 00:30:52,082
Take a settle.

383
00:30:54,984 --> 00:30:58,288
- Flo, get your hands up!
- No need for that, mister.

384
00:30:58,321 --> 00:31:01,125
Y'all can put your hands down.

385
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:07,098
You heeled?

386
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:09,100
Just my scatter gun
over yonder.

387
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:15,640
There's another.

388
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:18,977
Under the bed in the sleep room.
Six-shooter.

389
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:27,451
- Daddy, look what she did!
- They found it, they'd kill us.

390
00:31:27,483 --> 00:31:30,120
It's okay, honey.

391
00:31:30,153 --> 00:31:32,355
Smart young lady
you got there.

392
00:31:32,388 --> 00:31:34,424
Now, mister...

393
00:31:35,692 --> 00:31:38,461
Mister, I'm trying real hard

394
00:31:38,494 --> 00:31:41,164
to be as nice
as I done well can.

395
00:31:42,165 --> 00:31:44,935
Ain't gonna tell you
more than once.

396
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:47,270
Don't you ever lie to me.

397
00:31:47,304 --> 00:31:48,907
Yes, sir.

398
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:52,676
That it?

399
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,212
Alright, then.

400
00:31:57,647 --> 00:32:01,451
- He isn't gonna kill us?
- Hush now.

401
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:04,421
Can I ask what exactly
we can do for you boys?

402
00:32:04,454 --> 00:32:07,290
You look like good boys.
Good Christians.

403
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:09,226
You wouldn't hurt us,
now would you?

404
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:11,996
I can assure you, ma'am,
these ain't good boys

405
00:32:12,028 --> 00:32:14,131
I got here.
And I myself, well,

406
00:32:14,163 --> 00:32:16,033
I's a hard case.

407
00:32:19,202 --> 00:32:21,305
But we ain't here
to do no killin'.

408
00:32:21,337 --> 00:32:23,340
I gots to have eats.

409
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,343
Yes, sir. We have...

410
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:28,078
hens' eggs and...
bean sludge for you.

411
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,246
Nice and hot.

412
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:38,756
- I think we strike gold, Henry.
- If you're all finished,

413
00:32:38,788 --> 00:32:42,059
I'd ask you
to slide yourselves down yonder.

414
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,663
Get a wiggle on. Come on.

415
00:33:00,576 --> 00:33:03,580
Keep your fire pointed
at their noggins, Joe!

416
00:33:11,087 --> 00:33:13,523
Where'd all that blood
come from?

417
00:33:13,557 --> 00:33:15,759
- Shut it now, girl!
- Why's she trying

418
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:19,462
to get us all full of bullets?
Quit pokin' at 'em.

419
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:21,399
Nothin' wrong
with the young lady

420
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,134
wanting to have
some conversation.

421
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:26,103
She's just a dumb, stupid kid,
sir.

422
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:35,078
Looks like a lady to me
if I ever seen one.

423
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,082
She's just stupid.

424
00:33:39,115 --> 00:33:40,751
You're stupid.

425
00:33:43,086 --> 00:33:44,721
Alright...

426
00:33:44,755 --> 00:33:47,591
let's be nice to each other
as we pass the time.

427
00:33:47,624 --> 00:33:50,227
- I'm sorry, sissy.
- No, you ain't.

428
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:53,263
- Well, yes, I am.
- No, you ain't.

429
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,298
Yes, she is already!

430
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,175
How many horses, mister?

431
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,678
Only two, sir,
and they's crows' bait.

432
00:34:07,711 --> 00:34:10,347
Other two died
in the freeze-out.

433
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,282
Dammit! Dammit all to hell!

434
00:34:12,315 --> 00:34:15,819
I got two pack mules, sir.
Mayhap that'll help.

435
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,121
I ain't ridin' no pack ass.

436
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:19,757
We'll take the horses,

437
00:34:19,789 --> 00:34:22,226
put Little Joe
on one of them mules.

438
00:34:23,793 --> 00:34:25,663
Mighty slow movin'.

439
00:34:25,695 --> 00:34:27,798
It'll get us to the meet-up.

440
00:34:32,335 --> 00:34:33,804
Alright.

441
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,775
Listen here, mister.

442
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:42,880
We ain't gonna hurt you none
as long as you go along.

443
00:34:42,913 --> 00:34:44,782
Alright?

444
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:47,585
We're gonna have a breath,
wash up,

445
00:34:47,617 --> 00:34:49,152
get some shuteye.
Then, at daylight,

446
00:34:49,186 --> 00:34:50,721
we're gonna light a shuck
outta here.

447
00:34:50,753 --> 00:34:54,324
Well, what if the lawmen
comes tonight?

448
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:57,561
That's the smartest thing
he's ever said.

449
00:34:57,594 --> 00:35:00,197
They wouldn't track us
this far.

450
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:04,202
If they had the sand to do it,
they'd be tracking dead horses.

451
00:35:05,702 --> 00:35:07,671
We got time.

452
00:35:07,704 --> 00:35:10,407
- You don't know that.
- I don't care a continental

453
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,742
what you think I know
or don't know.

454
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:15,612
What'd y'all do
to get in a fix like this?

455
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,148
What'd I tell you, girl?

456
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,715
It's their own,
private business, Flo.

457
00:35:18,748 --> 00:35:20,483
I know what you're thinking,
mister.

458
00:35:20,516 --> 00:35:22,785
But we ain't like that.
Like what?

459
00:35:22,818 --> 00:35:24,487
We ain't killers.

460
00:35:24,521 --> 00:35:26,457
We bank thieves.
We only beefed them

461
00:35:26,489 --> 00:35:28,491
'cause they was trying
to beef us.

462
00:35:28,525 --> 00:35:31,195
I knew we should've held off
when we saw who was in there.

463
00:35:31,228 --> 00:35:33,230
- Rather be in a bone orchard?
- Might as well be.

464
00:35:33,262 --> 00:35:35,732
More money on our noggins
than Jesse James.

465
00:35:38,235 --> 00:35:39,903
Hobble that lip, Joe.

466
00:35:39,936 --> 00:35:43,306
- We didn't hear nothin', sir.
- I'm sure you's good boys...

467
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,843
who had to do
what you had to do.

468
00:35:45,876 --> 00:35:48,379
How much? How much money
on your heads?

469
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:51,414
Keep it shut now!

470
00:35:56,887 --> 00:36:01,559
Only way we're gonna kill you
is if you don't go along.

471
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:04,727
Liar.

472
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,663
You'll kill us either way.

473
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,499
That one there's
got a lip on her.

474
00:36:08,532 --> 00:36:11,669
A mighty fine lip.

475
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:14,338
You sure got sand, lady.

476
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,244
Most cases...

477
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:22,313
you'd be right.

478
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:26,717
But... we ain't up
for doin' that no more.

479
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,885
You ain't into doin' that
no more.

480
00:36:28,918 --> 00:36:30,920
Unless need be, of course.

481
00:36:30,954 --> 00:36:33,624
How you know
we won't squeal?

482
00:36:33,657 --> 00:36:36,693
Because he knows we won't.
Right, sir?

483
00:36:36,726 --> 00:36:39,262
We're gonna make you flush,
honey.

484
00:36:39,295 --> 00:36:41,931
Rich people...
they don't like to squeal.

485
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:44,802
That's mighty generous of you,
mighty generous.

486
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:48,271
We've never been flush before,
Daddy, have we?

487
00:36:48,304 --> 00:36:49,973
No, honey. No, we haven't.

488
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:52,943
Make us lighter for the ride,
won't it, Charlie?

489
00:36:52,976 --> 00:36:54,678
Sure will, big bug.

490
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,013
How far to the border?

491
00:36:57,047 --> 00:36:59,617
Less than a day's ride.

492
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,418
Maybe a little longer,
draggin' plow.

493
00:37:01,451 --> 00:37:03,353
Might be nice
to get roostered.

494
00:37:04,987 --> 00:37:06,923
Please, Henry?

495
00:37:06,956 --> 00:37:09,460
A few nips couldn't hurt.

496
00:37:09,492 --> 00:37:11,795
You got any red eye?

497
00:37:13,496 --> 00:37:17,335
There's some for medicinal
matters in the sleep room.

498
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:38,021
What is it you called, ma'am?

499
00:37:38,054 --> 00:37:41,291
Her name's Ada,
but that don't seem important.

500
00:37:41,324 --> 00:37:42,826
Just be a good boy.

501
00:37:42,858 --> 00:37:45,528
I know you's a good boy
who believes in Jesus.

502
00:37:46,996 --> 00:37:50,433
I'll show you a good boy.

503
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:53,336
Come here, sit in my lap.

504
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:55,505
I will do no such thing.

505
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:58,976
You best not be making a mash
on no married woman loves Jesus.

506
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:01,577
- I'm just having a little...
- You ain't having nothing,

507
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,013
unless I say so.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

508
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:05,815
You should go for that one.

509
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:09,353
I'd rather die than to let you
put your filthy...

510
00:38:09,385 --> 00:38:10,820
Shut it, gyp face.
I'd rather die

511
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:13,856
than to put my filthy hands
on your pasty skin.

512
00:38:13,889 --> 00:38:16,960
- Throw up the sponge, kid.
- She laid into me first!

513
00:38:16,992 --> 00:38:19,362
You ain't seen what I saw.

514
00:38:21,364 --> 00:38:23,633
She been givin' me the eye
since we walked in.

515
00:38:26,036 --> 00:38:28,706
Just tell me which one
I'm sticking it in.

516
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:32,342
Then I'll get right to it
soon as I'm done washing up.

517
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:35,879
You behave yourself
and be a good ol' boy, Joseph.

518
00:38:35,911 --> 00:38:38,581
Need you to keep outside
watch tonight.

519
00:38:48,057 --> 00:38:50,094
Mister, is the girl married?

520
00:38:50,126 --> 00:38:51,862
No, I'm not.

521
00:38:51,894 --> 00:38:55,099
But I don't have any interest
in boys or leavin' home.

522
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,367
She can't get
in the family way.

523
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,969
Fever got her when she's young.
Makes it hard.

524
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:03,606
I'm sorry to hear that.

525
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,410
But when I asked, I meant her.

526
00:39:07,443 --> 00:39:09,913
- Her?!
- Yeah, her.

527
00:39:09,945 --> 00:39:11,581
She hitched?

528
00:39:11,614 --> 00:39:13,450
No, sir.

529
00:39:15,085 --> 00:39:17,588
She's only 15.

530
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:20,057
Seems like she got some time.

531
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:23,594
Most boys in the town
with consumption.

532
00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:32,769
What's your name, little bug?

533
00:39:34,804 --> 00:39:36,539
We call her Florence.

534
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:40,478
Well, I'll be.

535
00:39:41,478 --> 00:39:45,516
That's a sweet little name
for such a sweet little bug.

536
00:39:45,548 --> 00:39:48,418
Please leave our girls
to themselves, sir.

537
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:51,122
We keep 'em pure
and in the path of Christ.

538
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:55,692
She a pretty lady.

539
00:39:55,724 --> 00:39:57,827
I don't like
where this is going.

540
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,431
She ain't no lady.
She's just a girl.

541
00:40:00,463 --> 00:40:02,833
Ain't any lady
is the proper way, Mama.

542
00:40:02,865 --> 00:40:05,668
This ain't time for joking,
Flo. This man intends...

543
00:40:05,702 --> 00:40:07,104
I intend to what, ma'am?

544
00:40:07,137 --> 00:40:08,972
Don't like
what you're getting at.

545
00:40:09,005 --> 00:40:10,606
Don't mind my wife, sir.

546
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:13,610
She knows you don't intend
nothing sinister.

547
00:40:16,012 --> 00:40:19,016
Why don't you hop up
on my lap now?

548
00:40:19,048 --> 00:40:21,619
Now you wait a second there,
sir!

549
00:40:23,018 --> 00:40:25,788
You leave my daughter be,
or you gonna have to fight me

550
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:27,524
like Kilkenny cats,
guns or no guns!

551
00:40:27,556 --> 00:40:29,859
That's rich.

552
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,240
- Georgie! Christ in Heaven!
- Papa!

553
00:40:43,273 --> 00:40:46,009
Papa! Papa!

554
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:48,478
Ain't gonna be no fight,
mister.

555
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:51,815
- You ain't a good man.
- Never said I was.

556
00:40:51,847 --> 00:40:54,851
- You're a curly wolf.
- Maybe.

557
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:57,588
You killed him!

558
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,157
He ain't dead.
He's just boogered up.

559
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:04,228
Now pony up, little bug.

560
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,463
I ain't gonna hurt you.

561
00:41:09,231 --> 00:41:12,902
- Come on, missy.
- No! No, don't you touch her!

562
00:41:12,936 --> 00:41:14,738
Hey!

563
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,907
No need for that, Charlie.

564
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:22,212
She was comin'
on her own legs.

565
00:41:23,746 --> 00:41:25,882
Maybe I was, maybe I wasn't.

566
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:28,719
Still don't like
him pushing me places.

567
00:41:28,751 --> 00:41:30,587
That's fair enough, bug.

568
00:41:32,922 --> 00:41:36,092
Florence... Florence! No!

569
00:41:39,094 --> 00:41:41,197
You best stay where you is.

570
00:41:41,231 --> 00:41:43,233
Be a good boy
and make him stop,

571
00:41:43,266 --> 00:41:45,735
on account of Jesus!

572
00:41:47,237 --> 00:41:49,005
Joe!

573
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,976
I don't know nothin'
about Jesus.

574
00:41:53,108 --> 00:41:54,911
No need for that shit.

575
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:00,617
Sorry, Henry.

576
00:42:10,626 --> 00:42:12,262
Alright now.

577
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:17,635
Gone on, little bug...
take yourself a nice nip.

578
00:42:26,141 --> 00:42:28,110
He needs a doctor

579
00:42:28,143 --> 00:42:30,313
Broke nose
don't need no doctor.

580
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:32,783
Keep that flannel mouth shut,
girl.

581
00:42:32,815 --> 00:42:34,617
Everything's fine.

582
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,987
I... I don't need no doctor.

583
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,624
I'm just fine.

584
00:42:40,657 --> 00:42:42,992
You see? Told you so.

585
00:42:44,293 --> 00:42:48,164
He only hit me on account
of my threatening.

586
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:51,268
It's my own damn fault.

587
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,070
Now, that's the spirit,
mister.

588
00:42:54,103 --> 00:42:56,306
My apologies, ma'am.

589
00:42:57,306 --> 00:42:59,942
No excuse for what he done.

590
00:42:59,976 --> 00:43:02,179
I'm... alright.

591
00:43:04,047 --> 00:43:07,184
You just as fine
as cream gravy.

592
00:43:08,851 --> 00:43:11,054
You like sitting up here?

593
00:43:13,856 --> 00:43:17,293
Like it better
if you didn't stink so darn bad.

594
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:22,833
Young lady's got a point.

595
00:43:22,865 --> 00:43:25,802
I'll bet we smell worse
than pigs in shit.

596
00:43:25,835 --> 00:43:28,639
I told you I need a wash.
My parts itches.

597
00:43:29,706 --> 00:43:32,041
Where's the bathing happen
around here?

598
00:44:54,289 --> 00:44:56,259
You boys get watered up.

599
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:59,163
We'll trade posts
when you're done cleanin'.

600
00:45:25,454 --> 00:45:28,290
You wanna...
get yourself washed up,

601
00:45:28,324 --> 00:45:30,159
you best do it now.

602
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,463
Your family should pony up,
as well.

603
00:45:34,496 --> 00:45:38,034
They'd like to water up now,
that's their concern.

604
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:16,173
What in Jesus's name
does she think she doing?

605
00:46:18,507 --> 00:46:21,343
That's a smart girl.

606
00:46:21,376 --> 00:46:23,846
It's a mighty fine,
what she's layin' out.

607
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,481
Don't you reckon?

608
00:46:25,514 --> 00:46:27,217
Reckon what?

609
00:46:30,052 --> 00:46:32,522
She's trying
to save our lives.

610
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:54,978
If you told
I'd gotten a chill...

611
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:59,248
six marks on a clock ago,
I'd have laughed you down.

612
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:02,485
Wind's coming at night,
beast-like,

613
00:47:02,518 --> 00:47:04,253
this time of the year.

614
00:47:06,556 --> 00:47:08,559
Fire feels nice.

615
00:47:12,561 --> 00:47:14,364
What's your trade, mister?

616
00:47:14,396 --> 00:47:17,099
Mr. Tildon preaches
the Good Lord's word.

617
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:24,541
In that little church house?

618
00:47:24,574 --> 00:47:27,110
Yes, sir. When it's full.

619
00:47:31,447 --> 00:47:35,085
We gonna run into any funny
business in the morning?

620
00:47:35,117 --> 00:47:37,286
People walking about?

621
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,289
No, sir.
Town's a few miles in.

622
00:47:40,322 --> 00:47:43,292
We ain't had... nobody
at morning service,

623
00:47:43,326 --> 00:47:45,996
or any other,
for months now.

624
00:47:46,963 --> 00:47:49,566
Like I says,
town's got the consumption,

625
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,468
everyone's shut in.

626
00:47:52,668 --> 00:47:55,004
I'm gonna get some shuteye,

627
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,974
get myself a nice rubdown.
I'm sore deep.

628
00:47:59,976 --> 00:48:01,979
You know how, little bug?

629
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:06,149
Sir, may I say my piece?

630
00:48:11,153 --> 00:48:12,889
Much obliged.

631
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:18,461
I wanted to plead with you
one last time, man to man,

632
00:48:18,494 --> 00:48:21,463
please leave my little Flo's
purity for her husband,

633
00:48:21,496 --> 00:48:23,199
whomever that may be.

634
00:48:23,231 --> 00:48:26,068
- Please just be a good boy.
- I ain't no boy.

635
00:48:26,101 --> 00:48:28,170
Let me handle this.

636
00:48:29,739 --> 00:48:33,476
Your daughters give you
rubdowns, I take it.

637
00:48:33,509 --> 00:48:35,144
Why, yes, sir.

638
00:48:35,177 --> 00:48:36,946
That's the frontier way.

639
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,715
Daddy likes it
when I do it best,

640
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:40,684
'cause my hands are strong.
Yes, yes, honey.

641
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:42,686
Just... quiet down.

642
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:46,489
All I want's a rubdown,
same as you.

643
00:48:46,521 --> 00:48:48,424
Nothing sinister.

644
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,393
Nothing...

645
00:48:50,425 --> 00:48:52,528
sexual.

646
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:58,401
This is a house of God.
We don't talk about such things.

647
00:48:58,434 --> 00:49:00,503
What kind of things?

648
00:49:00,536 --> 00:49:02,072
Sexual things?

649
00:49:05,173 --> 00:49:08,344
Joe, you keep outside watch
tonight.

650
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:10,047
Take the other girl with you.

651
00:49:14,684 --> 00:49:16,519
Daddy? Daddy!

652
00:49:16,552 --> 00:49:18,188
Stop him, Daddy!

653
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:20,423
He'll behave himself.

654
00:49:20,456 --> 00:49:22,258
Charlotte, Charlotte,
you just go along.

655
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:23,660
Everything'll be fine.

656
00:49:23,693 --> 00:49:25,061
I'll try.

657
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:28,731
Honey. H-honey, look at me.

658
00:49:28,764 --> 00:49:31,266
I love you.

659
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,202
I love you, Daddy.

660
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:36,472
Joe, you behave yourself.

661
00:49:36,505 --> 00:49:38,641
No funny business.

662
00:49:46,081 --> 00:49:48,085
Pony up, little bug.

663
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:58,695
First light, we move.

664
00:49:58,728 --> 00:50:01,030
We're lucky
if they ain't dead.

665
00:50:01,063 --> 00:50:02,699
They didn't find no horses.

666
00:50:02,731 --> 00:50:07,237
You have to prepare for
a stretch like that to make it.

667
00:50:07,269 --> 00:50:10,072
Well,
maybe they was prepared.

668
00:50:10,106 --> 00:50:11,708
I doubt it.

669
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:14,411
They're bank robbers,
not trackers.

670
00:50:14,443 --> 00:50:16,246
I doubt it, too, but...

671
00:50:16,278 --> 00:50:18,815
they're gonna come across
some horses soon.

672
00:50:18,847 --> 00:50:22,719
And if they're still kicking,
they might kill for 'em.

673
00:50:22,751 --> 00:50:26,588
I don't think it's smart,
us going in only two like this.

674
00:50:26,621 --> 00:50:29,259
With surprise,
we'll get the bulge on 'em.

675
00:50:29,291 --> 00:50:31,094
When we get to Mesilla,

676
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:34,096
I plan to picking up
some more muscle.

677
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:36,298
That'll help.

678
00:50:39,635 --> 00:50:42,439
Honest, I don't miss the boys.

679
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:46,476
Their water's been more use
than them crossing this stretch.

680
00:50:49,644 --> 00:50:51,148
Yeah.

681
00:52:13,728 --> 00:52:15,698
Get up.

682
00:53:07,782 --> 00:53:09,351
Alright.

683
00:53:09,385 --> 00:53:11,621
...C'mon.

684
00:53:12,922 --> 00:53:15,592
You have the oils?

685
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,793
We use chicken fat.

686
00:53:20,795 --> 00:53:22,731
We'll do it dry.

687
00:53:28,637 --> 00:53:30,806
Well, now take it up.

688
00:53:35,311 --> 00:53:37,547
Get positioned proper, honey.

689
00:54:14,849 --> 00:54:16,652
Shit.

690
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:19,322
What the dickens got into you,
little bug?

691
00:54:19,355 --> 00:54:20,856
I'm sorry.

692
00:54:22,625 --> 00:54:24,360
Sonofabitch.

693
00:54:26,996 --> 00:54:28,865
I should've asked.

694
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:34,903
Girl...

695
00:54:34,936 --> 00:54:37,005
even I'm...

696
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:39,342
belly fired,

697
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:41,543
I ain't partial to that.

698
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,550
I'm sorry.

699
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:58,028
Shit.

700
00:55:06,735 --> 00:55:08,538
What are you doin'?

701
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:10,873
What's wrong?

702
00:55:10,905 --> 00:55:12,909
Am I not doin' it proper?

703
00:55:23,918 --> 00:55:26,422
I ain't opposed to relations
with you.

704
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:31,594
As a matter of fact...

705
00:55:36,065 --> 00:55:38,768
...I have a fire in my belly
right now.

706
00:55:41,436 --> 00:55:43,739
But this ain't the way
I want it.

707
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,043
I wanna bed you proper.

708
00:55:50,612 --> 00:55:53,482
But you're acting more like...

709
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,418
an adventuress than a lady.

710
00:55:56,452 --> 00:55:58,455
You been with one of them?

711
00:56:00,956 --> 00:56:03,960
Been with a couple in my day,
I reckon.

712
00:56:06,461 --> 00:56:09,065
But you gotta remember, I'm old.

713
00:56:09,097 --> 00:56:11,768
You're not old.

714
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,969
For a lawbreaker...

715
00:56:14,969 --> 00:56:16,638
...I'm ancient.

716
00:56:18,807 --> 00:56:21,576
What was it like
with the painted ladies?

717
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,480
Did they do it good?

718
00:56:26,815 --> 00:56:29,118
They have their own way.

719
00:56:33,856 --> 00:56:36,659
But if I wanted
those kind of relations...

720
00:56:37,659 --> 00:56:39,995
...I could have 'em
any time I want.

721
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:46,503
Now, what got into you,
little bug...

722
00:56:47,503 --> 00:56:51,173
...make you do
a thing like that?

723
00:56:55,143 --> 00:56:58,013
Youse likes to talks
about anything?

724
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:05,155
Alright.

725
00:57:07,722 --> 00:57:11,161
Youse real lucky
Henry called me off...

726
00:57:12,161 --> 00:57:15,164
...or I'd be fucking you silly
right now.

727
01:01:55,543 --> 01:01:57,713
Where'd that come from?

728
01:02:00,815 --> 01:02:02,317
Knife.

729
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:06,255
Where'd those come from?

730
01:02:12,994 --> 01:02:15,797
I think you know.

731
01:02:15,831 --> 01:02:17,467
I suppose I do.

732
01:02:18,833 --> 01:02:20,469
Did it hurt?

733
01:02:21,836 --> 01:02:23,338
Every time.

734
01:02:26,007 --> 01:02:28,443
Better than not hurting, though.

735
01:02:28,476 --> 01:02:30,846
That means it's all over.

736
01:02:32,481 --> 01:02:35,084
I never met a man like you.

737
01:02:36,851 --> 01:02:39,454
I reckon
you ain't met many men.

738
01:02:39,487 --> 01:02:42,157
Not many, but some.

739
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:44,860
I thought they were all
like my daddy.

740
01:02:48,864 --> 01:02:51,166
I was wrong.

741
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:53,201
You are a good man.

742
01:02:57,172 --> 01:03:00,009
I ain't never been accused
of such.

743
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:02,043
Well, I'm accusing you.

744
01:03:09,384 --> 01:03:11,219
How's your riding legs?

745
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:14,489
Better than most girls,

746
01:03:14,523 --> 01:03:17,860
worse than most boys, I suppose.

747
01:03:17,893 --> 01:03:20,463
- That'll do.
- I'm tough enough.

748
01:03:25,534 --> 01:03:28,070
You ever been down Mexico way?

749
01:03:29,237 --> 01:03:31,039
No.

750
01:03:31,072 --> 01:03:33,909
Mighty pretty
in the right spots.

751
01:03:39,414 --> 01:03:40,950
Henry?

752
01:03:42,416 --> 01:03:44,252
Yes, darlin'.

753
01:03:46,922 --> 01:03:48,557
You fancy me?

754
01:03:52,927 --> 01:03:54,931
I reckon I do.

755
01:03:56,097 --> 01:03:59,534
I fancied you soon the moment
you walked through that door,

756
01:03:59,568 --> 01:04:02,104
even though I knew I shouldn't.

757
01:04:03,572 --> 01:04:06,242
But it's different now.

758
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:09,110
Now that I know
you're a good man.

759
01:04:15,951 --> 01:04:18,253
Henry?

760
01:04:18,286 --> 01:04:20,121
Yes, darlin'.

761
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,927
I never been kissed before.

762
01:05:14,509 --> 01:05:16,646
Damn near Apache country.

763
01:05:18,012 --> 01:05:20,415
Maybe they got 'em already.

764
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:22,318
Maybe.

765
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:24,153
I doubt it, though.

766
01:05:24,186 --> 01:05:28,524
That stretch would've got 'em
before the Apache did.

767
01:05:32,661 --> 01:05:34,630
I just wanna collect 'em.

768
01:05:34,663 --> 01:05:37,266
I don't care
if they're dead already

769
01:05:37,298 --> 01:05:41,003
or alive as June Wiggles,
I just wanna collect 'em.

770
01:05:41,036 --> 01:05:43,005
Josiah.

771
01:05:43,038 --> 01:05:45,641
It's okay to lose out once.

772
01:05:45,673 --> 01:05:48,409
Hell, we're done flush already.

773
01:05:48,443 --> 01:05:51,647
Nobody's gonna
hold it against us.

774
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:55,350
No, it ain't,
and that ain't what it's about.

775
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:58,152
You oughta think about shutting
your cock-holster,

776
01:05:58,186 --> 01:06:01,523
'less you wind up like
old yellow man over there.

777
01:06:01,556 --> 01:06:03,525
You back down, Josiah.

778
01:06:03,557 --> 01:06:05,728
I'm not one of your whores.

779
01:06:06,695 --> 01:06:10,199
I won't quit until you do.
I'm just saying.

780
01:06:10,231 --> 01:06:12,067
Yeah, just sayin'.

781
01:06:13,568 --> 01:06:16,072
Let's light a shuck. Come on.

782
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:44,733
Take a sit on your seat.

783
01:07:05,619 --> 01:07:07,123
Alright now.

784
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,260
We all clear?

785
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:13,028
We's good.

786
01:07:14,762 --> 01:07:16,766
Time to hightail it.

787
01:07:18,632 --> 01:07:21,803
I knew that bastard'd keep
the woman the whole damn night.

788
01:07:21,836 --> 01:07:24,306
If my knob was slimy
with done cunny,

789
01:07:24,338 --> 01:07:26,141
I'd have stayed in there too.

790
01:07:26,173 --> 01:07:29,445
Wake it up now, Henry.
Time to light a shuck!

791
01:07:32,313 --> 01:07:34,282
Dammit, come on.

792
01:07:34,315 --> 01:07:36,117
Already late.

793
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:38,353
Don't wanna tempt fate.

794
01:07:38,385 --> 01:07:40,755
Them's rhymin' words,
Charlie!

795
01:07:40,789 --> 01:07:42,792
Well, ain't you smart.

796
01:08:01,675 --> 01:08:03,644
Take a settle...

797
01:08:03,677 --> 01:08:05,279
knuckleheads.

798
01:08:05,313 --> 01:08:07,682
What the fuck is this?

799
01:08:08,817 --> 01:08:11,420
- What do you think?
- Who's she think she is,

800
01:08:11,452 --> 01:08:13,322
Calamity Jane?

801
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:14,856
Well...

802
01:08:14,889 --> 01:08:17,559
this here's the new member
of our gang.

803
01:08:17,591 --> 01:08:19,393
What's gotten into you, sissy?

804
01:08:19,426 --> 01:08:21,829
You got rocks in your noggin,
Henry?

805
01:08:21,863 --> 01:08:24,333
- I'd mind your tone.
- I'll mind my tone just fine,

806
01:08:24,365 --> 01:08:26,835
but I'm mighty worried about
you givin' fire to this girl.

807
01:08:26,868 --> 01:08:29,872
You don't know her.
I'd mind your tone more.

808
01:08:29,904 --> 01:08:32,840
That's my wife-to-be.
Wifeto-be?

809
01:08:32,873 --> 01:08:35,676
Ain't nobody
gonna say nothing?

810
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:37,679
Ain't nothing nobody can say,
missy.

811
01:08:37,712 --> 01:08:40,582
First church we find,
we're gonna do it proper,

812
01:08:40,614 --> 01:08:43,184
ain't we now, Henry?

813
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:47,223
Why, yes, we is, little bug.

814
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:51,193
That way, I'm keeping
my promise, old man.

815
01:08:52,627 --> 01:08:54,930
Save her for her husband.
Charlotte.

816
01:08:54,962 --> 01:08:57,865
No, no, honey,
I done got my nose boogered,

817
01:08:57,899 --> 01:09:00,569
but my legs are just fine.

818
01:09:05,239 --> 01:09:06,841
Flo, you're upsetting your mama.

819
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:09,511
Why don't you come on
back to earth now?

820
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:15,449
I'm already right here
on earth, Papa.

821
01:09:15,483 --> 01:09:18,387
Henry and I
are going off together.

822
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:20,255
Please, sir. I beg you.

823
01:09:20,287 --> 01:09:24,292
In the name of the Good Christ.
She's just a baby.

824
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:26,728
She don't know what she's doin'.
Now I can tell...

825
01:09:26,761 --> 01:09:29,565
that you are a good man.

826
01:09:34,435 --> 01:09:36,471
Just like your husband?

827
01:09:39,274 --> 01:09:40,876
Yes, sir.

828
01:09:40,908 --> 01:09:43,578
Now, I know you don't wanna
lead her to the fire

829
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:45,413
when she's just a young'un.

830
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:48,250
She deserves a chance
to lead a righteous life.

831
01:09:48,283 --> 01:09:50,886
You shut it, Mama.
I've had about enough of you.

832
01:09:52,921 --> 01:09:55,490
Honey, I love you.

833
01:09:55,523 --> 01:09:57,525
You're my little baby!

834
01:09:57,559 --> 01:10:00,896
Honey, my sweetest,
darling little girl.

835
01:10:00,929 --> 01:10:03,297
I know you're just making a mash
to save us,

836
01:10:03,331 --> 01:10:05,234
but this here's a fair man.

837
01:10:05,266 --> 01:10:09,403
He got no need to bed us down.
He would've done it already.

838
01:10:09,436 --> 01:10:11,407
Henry, we gots to cut stick.

839
01:10:12,806 --> 01:10:14,443
Flo...

840
01:10:14,475 --> 01:10:16,277
you just tell this man...

841
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:19,514
that you love your family
and that we need you.

842
01:10:19,546 --> 01:10:21,817
Y-you tell him you can't go.

843
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:24,653
- Yes.
- I see here a man that...

844
01:10:25,819 --> 01:10:28,623
...he wants to make his way
away from the fire.

845
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:31,927
I see a man th-that wants
to lead the righteous way.

846
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,962
- Yes.
- I see a man here that might...

847
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,869
Sissy, why you playing
such devilish games?

848
01:10:41,903 --> 01:10:43,905
- I ain't playin'.
- Well, hell!

849
01:10:45,673 --> 01:10:48,443
Ain't she a firecracker.

850
01:10:48,475 --> 01:10:52,747
Honey... why you wanna
point a gun at your daddy?

851
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:55,984
What I ought to do
is open a crater in your face

852
01:10:56,016 --> 01:10:58,819
with this here pistol.
What you think about that, Papa?

853
01:10:58,853 --> 01:11:00,956
Well...

854
01:11:00,988 --> 01:11:04,458
it sounds to me
like he done bamboozled you,

855
01:11:04,492 --> 01:11:06,695
turned you against your own pa.

856
01:11:06,728 --> 01:11:07,895
Sissy,
that's just about enough!

857
01:11:07,929 --> 01:11:09,530
Now, you leave Daddy alone!

858
01:11:09,564 --> 01:11:11,600
Be a good girl, honey,
put the gun down.

859
01:11:11,632 --> 01:11:13,501
Just remember that the good Lord
is testing us.

860
01:11:13,534 --> 01:11:17,572
We can still serve him, honey,
and make everything better.

861
01:11:17,604 --> 01:11:20,841
Honey, we got
to stick together as family.

862
01:11:20,875 --> 01:11:22,711
- Yes.
- Alright.

863
01:11:26,547 --> 01:11:28,384
That's enough.

864
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:39,028
You wanna do this right, sweets.

865
01:11:49,404 --> 01:11:50,906
Siddown.

866
01:11:57,912 --> 01:11:59,715
Fresh?

867
01:11:59,747 --> 01:12:01,716
Hold on.

868
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,885
We got 'em alright.

869
01:12:03,917 --> 01:12:06,020
They're on foot,
headed to Mesilla,

870
01:12:06,054 --> 01:12:07,823
and this boy here,

871
01:12:07,855 --> 01:12:10,591
he's bleeding
like a wag tail on the rag.

872
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:13,895
I wouldn't be surprised
if we come up on another stiff.

873
01:12:13,927 --> 01:12:17,365
- Which way?
- Well, from here in...

874
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:21,737
there's only one way
that men can trek.

875
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:23,572
By the looks of this,

876
01:12:23,604 --> 01:12:26,774
they ain't but two hops
and a holler away.

877
01:12:27,942 --> 01:12:29,744
Do we ride?

878
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:32,081
Hell, yes. Let's cut stick.

879
01:12:35,817 --> 01:12:39,587
- Can I sit with my family, sir?
- I ain't gonna tell you twice.

880
01:12:39,621 --> 01:12:42,091
Sit... down.

881
01:12:49,096 --> 01:12:52,434
You too, missy,
other side of the table.

882
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,909
Henry, what the hell's
going on here?

883
01:13:01,943 --> 01:13:05,680
We need to cut stick.
It'll just take a few minutes.

884
01:13:05,712 --> 01:13:08,449
But it ain't arguable.
Best grab a chair.

885
01:13:08,483 --> 01:13:11,987
What in the Good Christ's name
is being got at here?

886
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:15,490
You shut your fucking mouth
till I tell you different!

887
01:13:16,123 --> 01:13:17,859
Hey, bug...

888
01:13:19,493 --> 01:13:22,997
...the things we talked about,
what do you wanna do first?

889
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:27,002
First thing...
or the second thing?

890
01:13:29,136 --> 01:13:30,838
The second thing.

891
01:13:32,774 --> 01:13:34,476
Alright, then.

892
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:37,146
Makes sense.

893
01:13:40,148 --> 01:13:42,150
Have at it.

894
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:48,657
No!!!

895
01:13:48,689 --> 01:13:51,859
Siddown!!
She ain't fucking around.

896
01:13:51,893 --> 01:13:53,528
No, she ain't!

897
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,963
Charlotte!!

898
01:14:09,543 --> 01:14:11,145
I'm sorry, sissy.

899
01:14:11,179 --> 01:14:13,548
I meant to hit you up higher.

900
01:14:16,551 --> 01:14:19,888
Move it, Mama.
'Less you wanna get sprayed.

901
01:14:32,132 --> 01:14:33,702
Bug.

902
01:14:43,211 --> 01:14:46,047
We're all damned
to eternal burning.

903
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:48,182
All of us, all of us.

904
01:14:48,216 --> 01:14:50,185
All damned.

905
01:14:50,217 --> 01:14:52,220
And the devil that deceived
was thrown

906
01:14:52,252 --> 01:14:55,189
into the lake of fire and
brimstone, where the beast...

907
01:14:55,222 --> 01:14:57,893
Shut up, woman!

908
01:14:57,926 --> 01:15:01,263
To the lake of fire
and brimstone

909
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:04,733
- Take a settle now, woman!
- Shut your fucking yammer box.

910
01:15:04,765 --> 01:15:06,867
Shut!

911
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:08,503
God!!

912
01:15:17,979 --> 01:15:20,916
What you've done
is unforgivable!

913
01:15:20,948 --> 01:15:23,217
The devil's in you now!

914
01:15:23,251 --> 01:15:26,855
There ain't nothing can keep
your soul outta the fires.

915
01:15:27,854 --> 01:15:29,890
Ain't nothing more demonic
than striking down

916
01:15:29,923 --> 01:15:32,226
your own flesh and blood,
your own kin!

917
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:34,061
Shut it, mister.

918
01:15:39,132 --> 01:15:43,137
I'd like to exchange words now,
man to man.

919
01:15:46,807 --> 01:15:49,109
Take off your vest.

920
01:15:49,143 --> 01:15:51,246
- P-pardon?
- You do as you're told.

921
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:53,148
Take off your vest.

922
01:16:03,824 --> 01:16:06,161
Get that outta here, will ya?

923
01:16:08,662 --> 01:16:10,164
Backdoor.

924
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:47,703
You look at me
when I talk to you.

925
01:16:49,203 --> 01:16:52,173
Yes, sir. I'm ready to talk.

926
01:16:52,206 --> 01:16:55,310
Now don't be a lickfinger.

927
01:16:55,342 --> 01:16:58,880
I wasn't licking no finger...
sir.

928
01:17:01,215 --> 01:17:02,851
Why don't you tell me

929
01:17:02,884 --> 01:17:06,387
how your oldest daughter
got all twisted up inside.

930
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:09,858
Why she couldn't be
in the family way.

931
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:14,229
I told you that already.

932
01:17:15,063 --> 01:17:17,332
She got the fever.

933
01:17:17,364 --> 01:17:19,233
You sure about that?

934
01:17:20,902 --> 01:17:23,238
Yeah, 'course I'm sure.

935
01:17:28,909 --> 01:17:31,046
Now,

936
01:17:31,078 --> 01:17:34,048
you have two choices,
you sonofabitch.

937
01:17:34,082 --> 01:17:36,251
Humiliation or death.

938
01:17:37,918 --> 01:17:40,889
Now, you either speak truth...

939
01:17:40,921 --> 01:17:43,924
or I'll pull the trigger.

940
01:17:46,761 --> 01:17:48,263
Well?!

941
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:52,934
She was pregnant.

942
01:17:53,935 --> 01:17:55,771
What?!

943
01:17:57,270 --> 01:17:59,873
- She was in the family way.
- When?!

944
01:17:59,907 --> 01:18:02,377
When was she in the family way?!

945
01:18:02,409 --> 01:18:04,945
- Please, sir, don't make me...
- You say it!

946
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:10,385
I was sick... I was sick
with the devil's seed!

947
01:18:10,417 --> 01:18:12,787
I was sick with the drink!

948
01:18:13,421 --> 01:18:16,091
There was a demon
living here with us!!!

949
01:18:16,123 --> 01:18:17,925
- How old?!
- A demon!

950
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:20,761
God have mercy on us all.

951
01:18:20,795 --> 01:18:22,797
How old was she, mister?

952
01:18:24,431 --> 01:18:26,266
Eleven.

953
01:18:34,442 --> 01:18:37,813
Eleven... years old.

954
01:18:42,449 --> 01:18:45,319
And I speak the truth when,...

955
01:18:46,453 --> 01:18:49,456
...when I say digging that baby
out of her

956
01:18:49,489 --> 01:18:51,992
is what twisted her
all up inside.

957
01:18:53,994 --> 01:18:55,896
You look at me.

958
01:18:58,064 --> 01:19:01,301
Who put her in the family way?

959
01:19:01,335 --> 01:19:03,838
Who planted that filthy seed?

960
01:19:06,474 --> 01:19:10,311
That was the devil's work.
That was the drink.

961
01:19:10,344 --> 01:19:12,947
You...
you frontier folk is wrong,

962
01:19:12,979 --> 01:19:15,382
if there ever was such a word.

963
01:19:15,416 --> 01:19:18,820
- The devil's work? The drink?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir!

964
01:19:20,488 --> 01:19:23,224
And I guess that you,

965
01:19:23,256 --> 01:19:25,993
you just... done fixed that,
right?

966
01:19:26,027 --> 01:19:28,328
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah? Long time ago?

967
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:33,001
Yes, sir. I...

968
01:19:33,033 --> 01:19:36,237
We... we brought
Christ back into our home.

969
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:40,041
I quit the drink.
We drove the demon out.

970
01:19:42,877 --> 01:19:46,014
So now the demon's clean gone?

971
01:19:46,046 --> 01:19:48,015
And you repent?

972
01:19:48,048 --> 01:19:51,051
So all's good? Good with God?

973
01:19:52,052 --> 01:19:54,488
Yes, sir. Christ forgives.

974
01:19:54,521 --> 01:19:56,858
He forgives.

975
01:19:56,890 --> 01:19:59,359
Yes, he does, mister,

976
01:19:59,393 --> 01:20:02,363
Yes, he does!

977
01:20:05,899 --> 01:20:08,068
So I have one more question.

978
01:20:09,904 --> 01:20:12,541
If the...the devil...

979
01:20:14,408 --> 01:20:16,912
...if he's gone
from this house...

980
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:22,083
...well, then,
that must've been you...

981
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:25,987
...getting your dirty ass licked

982
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:29,224
and your tiny prick slopped on

983
01:20:29,256 --> 01:20:31,391
by my bride-to-be last week,

984
01:20:31,425 --> 01:20:34,229
and the week before that
and the week before that!

985
01:20:34,261 --> 01:20:36,430
Hey, you shush!

986
01:20:38,932 --> 01:20:41,135
I might just pump you
full of lead

987
01:20:41,167 --> 01:20:44,538
on account of you knowin'
it was goin' on all these years.

988
01:20:44,572 --> 01:20:47,074
Yeah, that's right.

989
01:20:58,953 --> 01:21:00,589
You see...

990
01:21:08,595 --> 01:21:10,464
Here's the thing.

991
01:21:20,474 --> 01:21:22,143
You see...

992
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:25,947
...Christ forgives.

993
01:21:25,979 --> 01:21:27,615
He does.

994
01:21:29,984 --> 01:21:31,620
But I don't.

995
01:21:36,623 --> 01:21:38,393
Hey!

996
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:40,061
Joe.

997
01:21:40,094 --> 01:21:41,663
- Yes, sir.
- Here you are, old boy.

998
01:21:41,695 --> 01:21:43,931
I need you to do something
for me.

999
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:46,234
I need you
to fuck this man proper,

1000
01:21:46,266 --> 01:21:48,068
right there in that shit hole.

1001
01:21:48,101 --> 01:21:50,137
- What did you fuckin say?
- Please don't!

1002
01:21:50,171 --> 01:21:53,207
- Keep your heads down!
- What did you fuckin' say?

1003
01:21:53,239 --> 01:21:56,310
Charlie, you mind the ladies
for me, will ya?

1004
01:21:56,344 --> 01:21:58,479
Take 'em outside a spell.

1005
01:21:58,511 --> 01:22:00,180
My pleasure.

1006
01:22:04,351 --> 01:22:07,622
I don't need to put eyes
on this sick shit.

1007
01:22:11,192 --> 01:22:13,627
I don't know about this, boss.

1008
01:22:13,661 --> 01:22:16,096
I ain't never done
nothin' like it.

1009
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:20,167
You'll be fine as cream gravy.
Now whip out that knob, boy.

1010
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:21,636
Hey!!

1011
01:22:21,668 --> 01:22:23,704
You so much as move
another muscle,

1012
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:27,108
I'm gonna put two bullets
in the back of your head

1013
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:29,210
before you can say
eat my asshole.

1014
01:22:33,546 --> 01:22:36,350
- Okay.
- Where's that chicken fat?

1015
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:39,688
Heh! We're all out!

1016
01:22:41,689 --> 01:22:43,691
Shame.

1017
01:22:43,724 --> 01:22:46,360
Looks like Joe's going in dry.

1018
01:22:48,529 --> 01:22:50,732
I don't like some man ass.

1019
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:54,668
You put it in the back
of a woman, I reckon.

1020
01:22:54,702 --> 01:22:57,038
Yes, sir, once or twice,

1021
01:22:57,070 --> 01:22:59,373
with the old ladies
at Miss Rita's.

1022
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:01,476
There you go. Alright.

1023
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:05,546
Now you just close your eyes
and you imagine it's that...

1024
01:23:07,247 --> 01:23:09,384
nice lady's ass.

1025
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:12,687
Well... alright,
I reckons I can do that.

1026
01:23:14,587 --> 01:23:16,256
Alright, then.

1027
01:23:22,328 --> 01:23:24,264
You stay right there.

1028
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:38,012
Hey, mister.

1029
01:23:38,813 --> 01:23:41,416
You ready?

1030
01:23:41,448 --> 01:23:43,083
No!

1031
01:23:43,117 --> 01:23:46,554
Alright, go.
Now you hit him nice and hard.

1032
01:23:46,587 --> 01:23:49,424
Make sure he knows it's in him.

1033
01:23:49,457 --> 01:23:52,727
I ain't worked up, Henry.
I gots to get it ready.

1034
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:55,430
Alright. That's fine.

1035
01:23:55,462 --> 01:23:58,632
And you... take your time.

1036
01:24:00,634 --> 01:24:02,603
You stay comfortable.

1037
01:24:19,787 --> 01:24:22,490
You shush.

1038
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:25,626
You know...

1039
01:24:25,658 --> 01:24:28,328
usually I'd wait till after.

1040
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:31,332
But this is too good.

1041
01:24:34,667 --> 01:24:36,503
Ain't I the matchmaker?

1042
01:24:39,672 --> 01:24:42,643
All set. It's ready, Henry.

1043
01:24:42,676 --> 01:24:44,645
Alright, old boy,

1044
01:24:44,677 --> 01:24:48,483
now you shove it in there
nice and deep.

1045
01:24:48,515 --> 01:24:50,784
No!! Please! Please!

1046
01:24:50,818 --> 01:24:54,322
Just shoot me! Please!
Please! Shoot me!

1047
01:24:54,354 --> 01:24:57,157
...Stop! Stop.

1048
01:24:57,190 --> 01:24:59,493
Joe, stop.

1049
01:24:59,527 --> 01:25:01,496
You done good, boy.

1050
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:03,664
I don't gotta gets it in,
Henry?

1051
01:25:03,697 --> 01:25:05,666
No. No, you don't.

1052
01:25:05,698 --> 01:25:07,868
I just wanted to scare him,
is all.

1053
01:25:07,902 --> 01:25:10,505
Now put that thing back
in your riding pants.

1054
01:25:10,537 --> 01:25:12,339
Thank you!

1055
01:25:12,372 --> 01:25:15,809
Thank you from the bottom
of my gullet!

1056
01:25:15,842 --> 01:25:17,677
Hey, Joe,

1057
01:25:17,711 --> 01:25:19,680
fetch Florence.

1058
01:25:22,582 --> 01:25:24,351
And you,

1059
01:25:24,385 --> 01:25:27,688
get your ass up off the table
and sit down.

1060
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:30,690
You not gonna kill me?

1061
01:25:30,724 --> 01:25:33,360
Thank you, sir!

1062
01:25:33,394 --> 01:25:36,197
Thank you. Thank you.

1063
01:25:36,229 --> 01:25:40,700
I'm gonna clean the devil out...
proper this time.

1064
01:25:40,734 --> 01:25:42,804
How you doin', little bug?

1065
01:25:44,671 --> 01:25:46,875
You think
about what you wanna use?

1066
01:25:48,742 --> 01:25:50,244
Alright, then.

1067
01:25:59,587 --> 01:26:01,589
I reckon this'll do.

1068
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:04,725
She gonna shoot me?

1069
01:26:06,426 --> 01:26:08,896
No, no, no, Nancy pants.

1070
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:13,233
You see...
she wanted to at first.

1071
01:26:13,266 --> 01:26:17,771
Then I told her, y'know,
gunshot's quick, it's easy.

1072
01:26:18,771 --> 01:26:20,774
Gunshot's a good death.

1073
01:26:22,909 --> 01:26:24,778
You deserve to feel it.

1074
01:26:43,296 --> 01:26:45,732
Holy hell, girl!

1075
01:26:45,765 --> 01:26:48,268
You still have doubts
about our new member?

1076
01:26:48,301 --> 01:26:49,938
Hell no!

1077
01:26:56,476 --> 01:26:58,278
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1078
01:26:58,311 --> 01:26:59,948
You okay, honey?

1079
01:27:00,948 --> 01:27:02,783
You alright?

1080
01:27:02,815 --> 01:27:04,585
Water.

1081
01:27:04,618 --> 01:27:06,955
Hey, Joe, grab some water,
will you?

1082
01:27:10,957 --> 01:27:12,926
Alright?

1083
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,662
I'm sorry.

1084
01:27:15,828 --> 01:27:17,931
For a woman, little bug,

1085
01:27:17,965 --> 01:27:19,934
you done mighty fine.

1086
01:27:19,966 --> 01:27:21,668
Thanks, Joe.

1087
01:27:28,676 --> 01:27:31,279
I never seen
anything like that.

1088
01:27:31,311 --> 01:27:35,483
I suppose the look of it
just... turned my stomach.

1089
01:27:35,515 --> 01:27:36,984
It's normal.

1090
01:27:39,686 --> 01:27:42,990
You done real good. Real good.

1091
01:27:46,659 --> 01:27:48,662
No. No.

1092
01:27:50,997 --> 01:27:52,832
I wanna finish it.

1093
01:27:52,865 --> 01:27:54,534
Ma'am...

1094
01:27:55,703 --> 01:27:57,538
...can I indulge?

1095
01:27:59,806 --> 01:28:01,376
Alright.

1096
01:28:06,412 --> 01:28:09,082
Now, don't take this
the wrong way,

1097
01:28:09,115 --> 01:28:11,985
but there are better ways
to finish.

1098
01:28:12,019 --> 01:28:14,922
Now, you cracked him
mighty hard, but...

1099
01:28:14,954 --> 01:28:16,856
he's still alive.

1100
01:28:16,890 --> 01:28:19,994
I thought he'd be dead
after I broke his eye like that.

1101
01:28:20,027 --> 01:28:22,329
Yeah, you'd think so?

1102
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:24,832
But it don't always work
that easy.

1103
01:28:24,864 --> 01:28:27,534
You gotta hit
in the proper place.

1104
01:28:27,568 --> 01:28:30,604
Now...
do you want to finish him now...

1105
01:28:30,636 --> 01:28:34,541
or you wanna make him suffer
a little bit more?

1106
01:28:34,574 --> 01:28:36,376
Not much more.

1107
01:28:36,409 --> 01:28:38,378
Alrighty.

1108
01:28:38,412 --> 01:28:39,914
Lookie here.

1109
01:28:40,913 --> 01:28:44,384
You hit him here,
he dies immediate-like.

1110
01:28:44,417 --> 01:28:47,354
You hits him right here,
right here,

1111
01:28:47,387 --> 01:28:50,390
just make him squeal like a pig.

1112
01:28:50,423 --> 01:28:52,025
A thousand thanks, sir.

1113
01:28:52,059 --> 01:28:55,063
Call me Charlie.
We're friends now.

1114
01:28:59,932 --> 01:29:01,668
Finish him, darlin'.

1115
01:30:29,021 --> 01:30:32,126
Now that's a show
if I ever seens one.

1116
01:30:32,158 --> 01:30:34,161
Quiet, old boy.

1117
01:30:37,530 --> 01:30:39,033
Alright.

1118
01:30:40,167 --> 01:30:42,670
Let's get you cleaned up.

1119
01:30:42,703 --> 01:30:45,873
- Missy?
- Yes, Charlie?

1120
01:30:45,905 --> 01:30:48,609
Why'd you bed down your sis?

1121
01:30:56,550 --> 01:30:58,453
She liked it.

1122
01:31:04,557 --> 01:31:06,527
<i>Violence,</i>

1123
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,863
<i>how does it all begin?</i>

1124
01:31:08,895 --> 01:31:10,497
<i>The violence.</i>

1125
01:31:11,198 --> 01:31:14,702
<i>We're either on one side of it
or the other.</i>

1126
01:31:14,734 --> 01:31:17,036
<i>Sometimes both.</i>

1127
01:31:17,069 --> 01:31:19,539
<i>Where's the innocence go?</i>

1128
01:31:19,573 --> 01:31:21,642
<i>Is it gone?</i>

1129
01:31:21,675 --> 01:31:25,012
<i>Or is it always there
beneath the darkness?</i>

1130
01:31:25,045 --> 01:31:28,047
<i>Trying to remind us
who we are.</i>

1131
01:31:28,081 --> 01:31:30,583
<i>How do we lose ourselves?</i>

1132
01:31:30,617 --> 01:31:34,721
<i>Or we find in our true selves?</i>

1133
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:37,725
<i>The innocence or the darkness?</i>

1134
01:31:37,757 --> 01:31:39,760
<i>Which are we?</i>

1135
01:31:46,766 --> 01:31:49,170
You got some blood
on your face.

1136
01:32:10,623 --> 01:32:12,559
I'm leaving, Mama.

1137
01:32:12,592 --> 01:32:14,929
I was gonna kill you

1138
01:32:14,962 --> 01:32:17,097
- Why...
- Stubborn.

1139
01:32:17,130 --> 01:32:18,766
Why would you kill...?

1140
01:32:18,798 --> 01:32:21,068
Shut your yap, I beg.

1141
01:32:22,802 --> 01:32:26,606
I was going to kill you,
but Henry convinced me not to.

1142
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:29,310
He said he didn't wanna
spill no more blood,

1143
01:32:29,342 --> 01:32:31,979
didn't want me
getting too used to it.

1144
01:32:36,149 --> 01:32:39,653
Now, I reckon there gonna
be bounty-hunters and lawmen

1145
01:32:39,685 --> 01:32:42,322
on account of that big reward
they're offering.

1146
01:32:43,657 --> 01:32:46,159
You best keep your mouth shut,
Mama.

1147
01:32:47,661 --> 01:32:50,264
Remember,
this is a gift Henry gave you.

1148
01:32:50,296 --> 01:32:52,232
The gift of life.

1149
01:33:00,673 --> 01:33:02,976
And also best remember...

1150
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:06,046
that you will not know
where I am...

1151
01:33:06,078 --> 01:33:08,815
and I will know where you are.

1152
01:33:08,849 --> 01:33:10,585
You understand?

1153
01:33:11,685 --> 01:33:13,187
Yes.

1154
01:33:16,689 --> 01:33:19,025
Henry told me
to leave you that.

1155
01:33:26,033 --> 01:33:27,702
I wish I...

1156
01:33:29,703 --> 01:33:31,706
I would wish...

1157
01:33:40,881 --> 01:33:42,717
I know, Mama.

1158
01:36:14,201 --> 01:36:16,336
Those boys fucked a rooster.

1159
01:36:16,368 --> 01:36:18,037
It's a mess.

1160
01:36:19,872 --> 01:36:22,509
Let's take a look-see
around the property.

1161
01:38:02,309 --> 01:38:04,543
I need you
to tell me everything.

1162
01:38:04,577 --> 01:38:06,480
Where'd they go?

1163
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:09,983
Woman!

1164
01:38:20,327 --> 01:38:21,996
Where'd they go?

1165
01:38:34,341 --> 01:38:37,344
Well... that's that.

1166
01:38:37,377 --> 01:38:41,014
Did you wanna make a run?
You know I'm with you.

1167
01:38:41,046 --> 01:38:44,017
The border's close
and they hours ahead of us.

1168
01:38:45,652 --> 01:38:47,487
We're beat.

1169
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,156
We're not beat.

1170
01:38:49,189 --> 01:38:51,525
They just got our goat,
just once.

1171
01:38:53,659 --> 01:38:56,430
It's up to you. You're the boss.
We could stay.

1172
01:38:56,462 --> 01:38:59,498
Or we could cross over
and we could look for 'em.

1173
01:38:59,532 --> 01:39:03,369
No, I think you oughta
get on back to your family.

1174
01:39:03,403 --> 01:39:06,206
I'm gonna poke around Mesilla
a little bit,

1175
01:39:06,238 --> 01:39:10,343
get a hot bath, you know,
kinda linger, see if I can't...

1176
01:39:10,377 --> 01:39:12,479
Hey, hey, I'll stay.

1177
01:39:12,511 --> 01:39:14,514
I know you will.

1178
01:39:14,546 --> 01:39:17,050
I'm well-upped, though.

1179
01:39:18,051 --> 01:39:21,555
You cut on out,
get back to your family.

1180
01:39:23,222 --> 01:39:25,059
You're the boss.

1181
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:29,529
At least we got two of them,

1182
01:39:29,561 --> 01:39:31,398
Yeah, we did.

1183
01:39:54,587 --> 01:39:58,258
<i>Sometimes we decide
to take the wrong path.</i>

1184
01:39:59,591 --> 01:40:02,061
<i>We think we're righteous.</i>

1185
01:40:02,095 --> 01:40:04,564
<i>Surprise ourselves.</i>

1186
01:40:04,596 --> 01:40:07,100
<i>We go toward the fire.</i>

1187
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:10,103
<i>Make the wrong choice.</i>

1188
01:40:11,070 --> 01:40:12,739
<i>And we're beat.</i>

1189
01:41:52,704 --> 01:41:54,373
<i>It's all over.</i>

1190
01:41:58,845 --> 01:42:00,713
<i>It's all over.</i>

1191
01:44:04,337 --> 01:44:06,806
Open your eyes, little bug.

1192
01:44:06,838 --> 01:44:08,507
Mexico.

1193
01:44:09,341 --> 01:44:10,978
You and me.

1194
01:44:12,511 --> 01:44:14,947
- You and me.
- C'mon, love birds!

1195
01:44:14,980 --> 01:44:18,851
Let's get a wiggle on!
We cross, then we rest easy!

1196
01:44:22,854 --> 01:44:26,525
I'll never be able to show you
how grateful I am.

1197
01:44:27,694 --> 01:44:29,496
You will.

1198
01:44:29,529 --> 01:44:31,665
And I will.

1199
01:44:31,698 --> 01:44:34,534
Got all the time in the world.

1200
01:44:35,702 --> 01:44:37,704
No.

1201
01:44:39,706 --> 01:44:41,708
Henry!!

1202
01:45:07,966 --> 01:45:09,603
Henry?

1203
01:45:20,445 --> 01:45:22,048
I'm sorry, Henry.

1204
01:45:23,048 --> 01:45:25,618
I wanted to, I really did.

1205
01:45:25,650 --> 01:45:27,421
I just couldn't.

1206
01:45:33,126 --> 01:45:36,630
That reward money
is good, clean coin.

1207
01:45:40,432 --> 01:45:41,935
Well...

1208
01:45:43,935 --> 01:45:45,604
...that's it.

1209
01:53:12,518 --> 01:53:15,520
Didn't Daddy ever tell you
about revolvers?

1210
01:53:19,390 --> 01:53:22,194
You always, no matter what,

1211
01:53:22,228 --> 01:53:24,363
gotta leave one chamber empty.

1212
01:53:24,395 --> 01:53:25,998
You know why?

1213
01:53:27,233 --> 01:53:29,068
You know why?

1214
01:53:33,204 --> 01:53:35,140
It's 'cause
if you're addle-handed

1215
01:53:35,173 --> 01:53:38,877
and you stack up all six
and the gun drops - bam! -

1216
01:53:38,911 --> 01:53:42,347
then you've got yourself
in a real bad box.

1217
01:53:47,051 --> 01:53:49,255
Hell, Henry told me...

1218
01:53:50,421 --> 01:53:53,926
...he once knew a man
who shot off his own ball.

1219
01:53:56,561 --> 01:53:59,097
Never could have relations
again.

1220
01:54:08,439 --> 01:54:10,210
Poor thing.

1221
01:54:12,278 --> 01:54:14,113
Are you alright, Mother?

1222
01:54:15,113 --> 01:54:16,949
You look balled up.

1223
01:54:23,588 --> 01:54:25,291
I know.

1224
01:54:27,592 --> 01:54:30,128
I know.

1225
01:54:32,131 --> 01:54:34,968
I reckon today's
been a bag of nails.

1226
01:54:37,603 --> 01:54:39,471
Lots of changes.

1227
01:54:45,476 --> 01:54:47,145
Lots of changes.

1228
01:58:02,507 --> 01:58:04,577
Ahem.

1229
01:59:56,654 --> 01:59:58,890
Mighty nice, Joe.

1230
02:00:01,460 --> 02:00:03,296
Mighty nice.
