1
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,339
Listen.

2
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,673
Listen to wind.

3
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,981
Curt.

4
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,082
Maybe I'm just hearing things.

5
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,414
Hey, what's going...

6
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,358
Look out you don't get
a fist in the teeth.

7
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,325
Curt!

8
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,023
Cattle's bawling.
Something's at them.

9
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,201
Is that what you woke me up for?

10
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,634
Wait till the wind changes.

11
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,640
How long has this been going on?

12
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,076
Joe Sam just now told me.

13
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,744
Thinks it's the cat, huh?

14
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:37,542
The black panther that's big as a horse,
and you can see right through him.

15
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,952
Shoot at him,
and he keeps on coming.

16
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,715
So what are you gonna do,
just stand there and listen?

17
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,256
Thought you'd like to know.

18
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,792
Thinking's about all
you do around here.

19
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:51,520
Get your clothes on.
He ain't gonna wait for us.

20
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,026
What do you see, Joe Sam?

21
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,061
You see the black panther?

22
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,431
Look at him seeing it.

23
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,842
Snow come.

24
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,503
Black panther come.

25
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,739
Let him be!

26
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,042
You get him out of here, or I will!

27
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,082
I'll finish it today.
Go on back to bed.

28
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,695
Joe Sam's personal medicine man.

29
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,229
Well, I've got the proper medicine
for that cat.

30
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,703
A .3030 slug right between the eyes.

31
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,698
That'll kill him for sure.

32
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,872
Unless he's black.

33
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,509
Yeah, unless he's black.

34
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,642
Hey, wake up!

35
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,710
I had a dream
I was trying to remember.

36
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,548
Cat's out there,
and he had a dream.

37
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,053
Well, they were here when we came...

38
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,921
and there were more deer
than there are now.

39
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,484
So don't kill him, huh?

40
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,396
Just let him kill stock.

41
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,693
The old man and his com stock,
and you and the good old days...

42
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,794
and that old Indian with his cat.

43
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,538
Well, we woke the old lady.

44
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,077
Now there'll be two of you.
We'll never get out.

45
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,010
Well, I'm all set. I'll go.

46
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,648
No, you won't do, kid.

47
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,717
Got to take Art
in case the cat's black.

48
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,817
I wouldn't know what to do
if it was black.

49
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,452
You could take Joe Sam.

50
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,514
No, he'd be for the cat.

51
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,720
I don't know if
I'd trust you, either.

52
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,660
Better let me come along Curt.
A million to one it ain't black.

53
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,788
Now, you know better than that, kid.

54
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,527
You know
how Joe Sam gets with the first snow.

55
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,827
You're the white hope of the Bridges.

56
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,636
You stay right here
and tend to the future.

57
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,538
Don't mess around
cooking anything, Ma.

58
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,278
Got to get out in a hurry.
Panther's at the stock.

59
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,679
Are you going alone?

60
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,511
No, ma'am. I'm taking Art.
In case he's black.

61
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,609
He'll be like that all the way.

62
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,779
You get so you don't hear him.

63
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:00,025
Seems to me
you could wait until daybreak.

64
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,954
Won't be many tracks
left in this snow.

65
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,931
That won't stop Curt. Never has.

66
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,410
Well, I asked for a medicine man,
and what do I get? A monk.

67
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:23,177
Did you know
we had a monk in the house, Ma?

68
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,044
Don't blaspheme.

69
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,651
No need to hurry as I can see.

70
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,182
I'll be a few minutes yet.

71
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,281
Art dreamt it was a panther.

72
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,286
Had a notion it might be black.

73
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:39,256
I had a dream, myself, and it
ain't left me in no mood for jokes.

74
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,966
The place is just crawling with dreams.

75
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:43,829
Did you have any, kid?

76
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,935
No, I wouldn't waste my time dreaming
either, if I had a girl like Gwen.

77
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,237
Watch your mouth!

78
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:53,903
Now, what'd I say, Ma?

79
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:57,005
All I said, with a girl like Gwen,
who'd waste his time dreaming?

80
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,346
Curt likes a dream
he can lay his hands on.

81
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,612
Yes, sir.

82
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,718
I said, watch your mouth!

83
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,716
Hal ain't like Art, Ma.

84
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,481
Old Art's a monk.

85
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,492
Hal, he's just a kid,
and already he's got...

86
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,289
You hear me, Curtis?

87
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,764
Well, I'm no kid, either.

88
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:17,632
I'm 37, Art's 43, and the old man's
nobody knows how far past 70.

89
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,071
You go bossing the bunch of us
like we was kids.

90
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,039
Can't even make a little joke.

91
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,200
The girls is awake in there.

92
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,302
You want Gwen Williams to hear you?

93
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,516
Now what did I say, Ma?
Just tell me one little thing I said.

94
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,881
Wouldn't take any fancy guessing
to know what you mean.

95
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,950
Well now,
if we're gonna start guessing...

96
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:39,354
anything I said about Gwen Williams is
brotherly love compared to what you...

97
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,949
Let it go, Curt.

98
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:47,390
Just thought maybe the kid might like
to know what his ma thinks of his girl.

99
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,835
If you're in such an all-fired hurry
to get out after that cat...

100
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,132
you'd better be
getting them ponies saddled.

101
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,936
And don't go taking holy names in vain
every time you open your mouth.

102
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:05,875
They're likely to be a long time,
if you was figuring on waiting.

103
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,781
Ask her what she thinks of your girl.

104
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,944
They're having a good time in there.

105
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,850
Yeah. Ain't they, though?

106
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,321
Don't you think it'd be better
if Harold would go instead of you...

107
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,084
the way Curt's taking on this morning?

108
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,650
He can't very well with Gwen just come.

109
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,353
Her first visit, too.

110
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:54,695
She's gotta be broke into the rest of us
kind of gradual, and he better do it.

111
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:59,497
Harold, have you thought any how
you're gonna live when you get married?

112
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,103
Well, it hasn't gone that far, yet.

113
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,142
Well it's what you want, ain't it?

114
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,177
It's for sure
what the Williams think you want...

115
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,611
all the time
you've been sitting in their kitchen.

116
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,182
Well, I guess so, if she does.

117
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,081
You needn't worry too much about that.

118
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,814
Not with all the money
this ranch could make...

119
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,585
and that gopher hole
the Williams live in.

120
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,819
She's not that kind, Ma.

121
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,720
What kind is she?

122
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,863
Have you got a name for her
I haven't got?

123
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,667
Was you expecting to bring her
in this house to live?

124
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,903
No, I don't think so.

125
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,111
Well, then,
what was you figuring on doing?

126
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,010
Does it have to be settled
right now, Mother?

127
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,749
Now is just as good a time as any.

128
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,881
She don't think
she was asked over here...

129
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,046
just to keep an old maid
like Grace company.

130
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,559
Harold's too young to get married,
and to an older woman at that.

131
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:57,056
You talk like she was 50!
She's not two years older than I am!

132
00:09:57,163 --> 00:10:00,655
Two or 20,
you're a child compared to her.

133
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,165
You couldn't even support a wife...

134
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,236
even if she was proper for you,
which she ain't.

135
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,328
What do you want, Mother?

136
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,669
One of these days,
the Bridges are gonna die out.

137
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,207
Is that what you want?

138
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,967
Harold's found a girl.

139
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:15,073
You think you'd be glad,
instead of turning against her.

140
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:21,118
It's been a long time
since Grace laughed like that.

141
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,251
And your pa primping himself,
just for her.

142
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,526
They wouldn't have to live here.

143
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,528
We could have
an old-fashioned house-raising.

144
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,658
I thought that was just about
where we was heading.

145
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,233
Well, why not?

146
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,699
This is a big valley.

147
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,032
It can hold a lot more stock
than we've been running.

148
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,572
We could have one drive, one roundup,
same as ever.

149
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,801
Only let Hal take out his share.

150
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,536
Splitting things.

151
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,545
Once the splitting starts,
it never stops.

152
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,445
Dad owes him the start.

153
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:54,682
It's been a long time since your pa's
had any say about anything.

154
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,389
Have you spoken to Curt?

155
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,591
That's where it sticks, doesn't it?

156
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,223
That's where everything sticks.

157
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,529
Well, one of these days.

158
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,100
One of these days.

159
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,192
That's the Bridges motto around here.

160
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,669
Harold, why don't you go with Curt?

161
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,667
If you're waiting on Arthur...

162
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:19,677
the only one he really stands up for
around here is that no-good Indian.

163
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,739
Now's your chance
to stand up for yourself.

164
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,974
Go along with him,
and then you could talk to him...

165
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,711
while you're hunting the panther.

166
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,480
Well, don't think I won't.

167
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,552
Of course, you will.

168
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:35,093
Then you'll have something
to tell your girl when you get back.

169
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,061
Come on, Ma.
You know what Curt will say.

170
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,466
Besides, he might need me
if the cat's black.

171
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,961
What are you carving that thing for?

172
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,769
I have a mind to throw it in the stove.

173
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,971
Joe Sam likes a god he can see.

174
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:53,578
You and your heathen nonsense,
your godless jokes.

175
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,308
Keep it up, and you'll be believing them
the same as that no-good Indian.

176
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,884
If I had my way,
I'd throw him off the place.

177
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:07,989
Come on, here!

178
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,293
What's the matter with you? Move!

179
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,762
What's bothering you, Kentuck?

180
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,679
Take her out!
And quit spooking Kentuck!

181
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:36,955
Boo.

182
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:32,533
The girls up yet?

183
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,846
No, not yet, but any minute now.

184
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,946
Fine, then I can get my shaving done
before they come out.

185
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:52,358
Letty, some hot water, if you please.

186
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,269
Letty, I asked you!

187
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,600
Just who do we think
we are this morning?

188
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:08,242
John Mackey seeing Paris,
or Leland Stanford on his private train?

189
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,432
It must seem evident that
with company in the house...

190
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,662
it wouldn't do any harm
for one mem...

191
00:14:13,697 --> 00:14:15,518
- Here you go, Dad.
- member of this family to put it...

192
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,483
To put in a decent appearance.
Thank you, son.

193
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:22,083
It's gratifying for a man to receive
any consideration...

194
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,128
at all in his own house.

195
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,036
Seventy-one this last summer.

196
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,977
You'd think a man that old...

197
00:14:33,978 --> 00:14:36,498
wouldn't have enough head left
to turn.

198
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,581
Well, shaving, Mr. Bridges?

199
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,651
Shaving himself raw just for her.

200
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,886
Those young ladies are certainly having
the time of their lives in there, huh?

201
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,323
I told you not to bother cooking, Ma.

202
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,865
- Horses are ready, Art.
- Where are you going?

203
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,026
You can't go
without some food in your belly.

204
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,660
Well, the storm's letting up.

205
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,432
We got a pretty good chance
of getting him...

206
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,801
if we get up there before daylight.

207
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,876
Get what? What's he talking about?

208
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,739
What makes you so sure it's a panther?

209
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,739
What else would make the cattle bellow
the way they was?

210
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,715
- It's a panther all right.
- Maybe it's a bear.

211
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,610
The snow could be worrying them.

212
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,680
No. I know it's a cat.

213
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,684
Probably the same one
that got my dogs last year.

214
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,919
I'm gonna get him this time, if I have
to chase him clear to Placerville.

215
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,393
I'll tell you one thing.

216
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,056
You ain't gonna nail
the next hide up on the house.

217
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:36,692
- Not even if it's black?
- Not if it's red, white, and blue.

218
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,196
Such a stink
every time the door was open.

219
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,174
Yeah, but a black one, Ma.

220
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,573
Might bring some good luck
to the house.

221
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,311
Well, I'll take less luck
if it'll make less stink.

222
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,678
Sit down. I'll get you some breakfast.

223
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,047
You better take Hal's rifle.

224
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:56,019
That old Sharp's of yours is about
as much use as throwing rocks.

225
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:00,414
No use taking a gun
if it's Joe Sam's kind of cat.

226
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,110
Better take your snowshoes.

227
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:03,227
Won't need them.

228
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,559
We'll get him up on the north draw,
if we get him at all.

229
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,497
He'll be in there.
He can't be anyplace but there.

230
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,964
The bellowing come from the north.
He's got to be in there.

231
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,195
Too bad that ain't finished.

232
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,165
If a bullet don't stop him,
we might need it.

233
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,334
Okay.

234
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,981
I hope it snows for
a whole week, then.

235
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,856
Good morning, my dear!
Good morning! Come.

236
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,926
Come sit down beside me. Right here.

237
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,160
Letty will have breakfast for you
in no time at all.

238
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,599
Thank you, Mr. Bridges.

239
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,500
Cup of coffee for Miss Williams,
Letty.

240
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:50,041
And my bottle and the glass
from the cupboard, if you don't mind.

241
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:54,100
Nothing like a little cheer
on a cold, cold morning, huh?

242
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,812
Better watch the old goat.
He'll steal your girl.

243
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,409
I must apologize for my sons,
Miss Williams.

244
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,457
If they were gentlemen, they'd apologize
for waking you at this unseemly hour.

245
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,118
But gallantry is dead.

246
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,465
I sure hate to break up this little party
just when it's getting so good...

247
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,380
but we got a call to make,
Art and me.

248
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:16,796
Old friend of Joe Sam's.

249
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,865
It's only a foolish joke, Miss Williams,
and a worn-out one at that.

250
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:22,642
We're in kind of a hurry,...

251
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:25,710
so Hal will have to explain it to you
the best he can.

252
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,459
Which is too bad in a way...

253
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,508
because Arthur's the one
that really knows.

254
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,048
He talks to the thing.

255
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,176
Come on, Curt, let's go.
Joe Sam's freezing out here.

256
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,113
Why are you going?

257
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,786
You don't think I could handle a black
panther by myself, do you, Gracie?

258
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,384
An ordinary yellow one, maybe,
but not a black one.

259
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:44,553
You don't have to go.

260
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,611
If he's so set on going,
let him go alone.

261
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:48,360
It doesn't take two to shoot
at a shadow.

262
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,264
Grace, you're getting yourself
all worked up.

263
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:54,363
Why do you do whatever he wants?
You know you do. You always do!

264
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,437
I'll bring your little Arty back home
safe and sound, Gracie.

265
00:17:57,438 --> 00:17:58,770
Don't you worry.

266
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,239
If it was just you,
I'd wish it was black.

267
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,340
Yes, I would!

268
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,518
You and your cheap sneer
and your self-importance.

269
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:09,052
- Always judging others by yourself.
- Grace!

270
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,485
He does. He always does!
He's a cheap, dirty-mouthed bully!

271
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:56,565
Well, if there's a cat out there,
Curt will get him.

272
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,397
He's just about the best hunter I know.

273
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,995
He has a gift for it.

274
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,331
I remember one year...

275
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:06,400
I don't guess Gwendolyn's so crazy
to hear about Curt's fancy shooting.

276
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:12,250
It's getting so it's impossible to have a
little sociable conversation around here.

277
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:16,316
Eat your breakfast, Miss Williams.
Go ahead and eat.

278
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:21,222
We've lost even the most ordinary
consideration in this wilderness.

279
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,920
All sense of the
amenities of civilization.

280
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:29,561
You have no idea the pleasure it is
to have you under this roof.

281
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:33,204
It reminds us of ourselves.
A little.

282
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,270
Heaven knows we need
to be reminded.

283
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,911
The true pleasure, of course,
is your presence.

284
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,447
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

285
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,213
Come on in, Joe Sam.

286
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,958
Joe Sam, get over by the fire.

287
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,667
Don't mind him, my dear.
He's seeing things.

288
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,335
Always happens with the first snow.

289
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,805
Drink this coffee.
It'll make you warm.

290
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,745
Not cold.

291
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,679
Him and his black panthers.

292
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,353
Every year
we go through the same nonsense.

293
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:33,796
He claims it comes with the first snow.
That's what the carvings are about.

294
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,159
Medicine, help him fight it off.

295
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,431
Only Arthur missed this year,
with the snow coming early.

296
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,300
That's why he's this way.

297
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,671
"Oh, that I were as
in the months of old...

298
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,638
as in the days
when God watched over me...

299
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:53,179
when his lamp shined upon my head...

300
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:58,187
and by his light,
I walked through darkness."

301
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,984
- You never told me about him.
- Well now...

302
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,621
when a young man has to ride
all that way to get in a little courting...

303
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:09,599
you'd hardly expect him to waste
any words talking about the hired help.

304
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:14,161
- Arthur's the only one he ever talks to.
- Pack of lies, that's what he says.

305
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,867
He was a brave
when Fremont camped at Pyramid Lake.

306
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,943
He remembers the brass cannon...

307
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,171
the kind of buttons
Fremont wore on his coat...

308
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,271
a lot of other little things
that couldn't be lies.

309
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,476
Things he says would make him
more than 100 years old.

310
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,515
He was a war chief
when they had that fight on the Truckee.

311
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,647
He spoke at the last council
before that fight.

312
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,721
His sons were all killed in that battle.

313
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,892
That was way over 60 years ago,
so he must be pretty old.

314
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,965
They took an awful licking, and after
that they scattered all over the country.

315
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,270
Joe Sam took his family...

316
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,831
Well, just his wife and daughter
left by then.

317
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,736
They went up
into the mountains around Shasta.

318
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,273
That's where
the black panther got started.

319
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,538
They were camped up in the woods
in the high country.

320
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,583
His wife and daughter went down
the creek to get some water.

321
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,619
He heard them screaming.

322
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,187
He got down as fast as he could...

323
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:05,153
and saw the cat
going off through the willows.

324
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,425
It happened during the first snow.

325
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,821
Arthur thinks that the cat is
Joe Sam's personal spirit.

326
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,266
It stands for the whole business
of being run out by the whites.

327
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,371
Sit down, Grace.

328
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,513
Do you want something to eat?

329
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,550
If I could have a cup of coffee, please.

330
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,446
What is it?

331
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,254
The Indian, he was right there.

332
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,101
He's been here all right.

333
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,267
His stink is still in the air.

334
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:06,771
He's a big one.

335
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,840
Maybe not as big as Joe Sam's cat.

336
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,479
He's big.

337
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,042
Look at that, will you?

338
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,106
Look what he's done.

339
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,916
Trail's still fresh as a daisy.

340
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:49,318
There's blood on him.
He must've got horned.

341
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,787
- He'll be mean.
- Yeah. He's been feeding.

342
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,949
He's eating mighty high for a cat.

343
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,124
Hold him down, will you?
Keep him quiet!

344
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,390
It's the steer.

345
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,056
Blood's spooking him.

346
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,158
The steer?
What do you mean "the steer"?

347
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,032
You got three of them. Count them.

348
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,771
Two of my best year-olds
and the cross...

349
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,170
that bull I been planning on.

350
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,539
He's finished, too,
by the look of him.

351
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,407
Your steer?

352
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:23,082
You're always talking about this
valley like it was your valley.

353
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,521
The only plans that mean anything
around here are your plans.

354
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,786
Well, other people have plans, too.

355
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,688
Not me, but Harold might.

356
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,624
He's thinking of getting married.

357
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:37,330
No ordinary cat to break up
a bunch like this.

358
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,130
Must have been the bull horned
him, by the look of it.

359
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:42,602
It's gonna be a mean cat.

360
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,474
We've always worked together.

361
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,544
Put everything together in one pot.

362
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,979
You're the only one
who's ever done any taking.

363
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,714
I imagine Harold will want to
do some taking for a change.

364
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,184
- Yeah, we'll talk about it.
- That's what we're doing right now.

365
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:58,954
Talking about it.

366
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,983
I'm telling you how it's gonna be.

367
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,118
How is it gonna be, Art?

368
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,659
We're gonna work together,
same as we always have.

369
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,494
Only Hal's gonna get his share
without asking for it.

370
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,625
Without waiting
for you to hand it out.

371
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:14,101
If it wasn't for me, there wouldn't be
any valley, wouldn't be any stock.

372
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,469
The cats would have it all.
The Indians would have it.

373
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,805
You'd have given it back to them
a long time ago.

374
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,609
I built this all up.

375
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,737
It's Hal's, too. He's worked.

376
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,846
Gonna get married, huh?

377
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,818
Gonna get him a wife
and settle down.

378
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,546
Well, she's a nice girl.

379
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:32,748
She'll make a fine wife,
married to that no-man kid.

380
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,522
Why didn't he come to me,
talk to me himself...

381
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,288
instead of getting you to
stand up for him?

382
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,223
I stand up for you, too, Curt.

383
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:43,197
Have you ever thought how things would
be around here if you had your way?

384
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,698
No.
How would it be, Arty?

385
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,370
Tell me how it would be.

386
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,165
First thing,
I'd run that Indian off the place.

387
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,903
Anybody else that didn't carry
his weight would clear out, too.

388
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,308
I'd whip this valley into shape.

389
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,805
In no time at all,
you'd have nothing left to shoot...

390
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:01,209
nothing left to fight,
nothing left to flatten.

391
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:03,281
You wouldn't have anybody to yell at.

392
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,719
There wouldn't be anybody but you.

393
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,655
Then what would you do, Curt?

394
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,957
Well, there's one thing I'm gonna do,
and I'm gonna do it right now.

395
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,693
There's a cat been killing our stock.

396
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,830
I'm gonna walk up there
and take a look...

397
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,702
and if I see him, I'm gonna put
a bullet right between his eyes.

398
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,866
That is, if you don't mind.

399
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:42,850
He was up there all right,
but he ain't now.

400
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,991
Lit out
while you were shooting off your face.

401
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,365
Cleared the rim rock,
and up the north side.

402
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:50,866
He'll be back.

403
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,596
Oh, sure.

404
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,067
It would've been
an easy shot in here, too.

405
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,141
We could take the horses
over on the other side...

406
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,142
where he wouldn't get wind of them
and wait him out.

407
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,474
You could wait till kingdom come,
couldn't you?

408
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,013
Well, I can't.
I'm gonna track him down.

409
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,015
You can't go a mile in those boots.

410
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:08,051
You'll need snowshoes and some food.

411
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:11,020
You'd like to go back to the house,
wouldn't you?

412
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,522
So you can tell them all
how you told me off...

413
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,286
playing the loving priest.

414
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:18,192
Thanks.
I'll go myself.

415
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,622
Get what I need, and get it now
instead of sometime next week.

416
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,633
Fine. You can forget
I said anything.

417
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:24,895
Talk to Harold yourself.

418
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:27,304
Here. Careful, it's loaded.

419
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:31,139
Be sure to snap the safety off
if you have to use it.

420
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:34,334
You hold trail till I get back.

421
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,413
Be sure and drag a deep track
in case it snows and you get lost.

422
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:42,043
If he's still around, you'd better
see him first. So don't get to mooning.

423
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:43,747
Curt!

424
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,052
The girl means a lot to Harold.

425
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:49,687
Don't go cutting him down,
making him look foolish in her eyes.

426
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:39,122
- Was it a panther?
- Big one.

427
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,125
Made tracks the size of a horse.

428
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,563
Are you going after him?

429
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,134
Sure gonna try.

430
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:47,897
Get some grub ready, Ma.
Bread and jerky's all I'll need.

431
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:58,445
What's she trying to do,
make a pet out of Kentuck?

432
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,949
First thing you know,
she'll have all the Bridges tamed.

433
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:04,084
The only one
she's interested in taming is Harold.

434
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,255
Shouldn't have too much trouble there.

435
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,889
He's got about
as much spirit as a gelding.

436
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,194
What's the matter, Joe Sam?

437
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,199
Where Arthur?

438
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,130
Poor, old Art.

439
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,433
Doesn't anybody think
he can take care of himself?

440
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,303
He even got the half-wit worrying.

441
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,477
Don't you want to ask me
about the cat, Joe Sam?

442
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,144
He killed four of my stock.

443
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,139
Ran them like a wolf.

444
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:34,011
But he got horned, and he left tracks,
so he can't be black.

445
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,245
Where is Arthur? Why didn't he come?

446
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,452
Now, don't worry, sis.

447
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,747
If he's black, he'll be for Art.

448
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,723
If he's yellow, I left him my gun.

449
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:44,986
Get on.

450
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:49,992
One thing, if he's black, he's gonna
make a fine blanket for your bed...

451
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,681
with a hard winter coming on...

452
00:32:51,682 --> 00:32:53,827
and that bashful kid for a husband.

453
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:55,235
Don't mind him, Gwen.

454
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,097
We are gonna have a wedding,
ain't we?

455
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:01,010
We don't have to listen
to his foul mouth.

456
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:04,644
Hey.
You saddle Kentuck...

457
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:07,908
and see to it that
you don't forget to soap his hooves.

458
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,543
I hear you're gonna build your house
right here in the valley.

459
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,123
- Did Harold discuss it with you?
- No, but Arthur did.

460
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:15,124
The kid sure got everybody
digging for him.

461
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:18,161
I'm wondering who he got to pop
the question for him. Grace maybe?

462
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,388
Don't answer him, Gwen.

463
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,055
Bet he hasn't even kissed you yet.

464
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,326
Waiting for somebody
to do that for him, too.

465
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,303
Hey, Ma?

466
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,273
Hey, Ma, if that panther's black,
I'm gonna skin it...

467
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,900
and give it to Gwen
for a wedding present.

468
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,343
She can lay it
right on top of her at night.

469
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,471
Make him stop, Mother.
Why don't you make him stop?

470
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,447
He's trying to spoil everything.

471
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,280
The black panther's the cause
of all the trouble in the world.

472
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,147
He's the evil in everybody.

473
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,813
Joe Sam says so...

474
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:48,721
Arthur says so, and Grace says so.

475
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,758
Even Hal out there.

476
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,863
I believe he'd say so, too,
if he had half a mind.

477
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:56,391
It's all right, Grace.

478
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,802
Why, sure, it's all right.

479
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,702
Just think how peaceful
you're gonna sleep...

480
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,273
if you ever get around to sleeping.

481
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,239
With the end
of all the troubles in the world...

482
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,777
right there over you
to prove that nothing can go wrong.

483
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,937
Here's your grub.

484
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,742
I put in just what you told me.

485
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:12,247
But I think you ought to have more.

486
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,612
No, that's plenty, Ma.

487
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,795
Why don't you dress
in your own room?

488
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,894
Wouldn't want me to freeze,
would you?

489
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,782
All right, Miss Williams,
you can turn around now.

490
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:58,293
Of course,
if it's just an ordinary panther...

491
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,296
it wouldn't be big enough for a blanket.

492
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,600
Might make a costume out of it, though.

493
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:06,529
You could give us
a special wedding dance.

494
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,932
I'm not much of a dancer.

495
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:13,333
Well, I'll show you.

496
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,273
You'd learn in no time.

497
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,076
- Harold's here with Kentuck.
- Is that so?

498
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,082
The times that kid picks to be fast.

499
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,646
He may even get around to telling me
his plans one of these days.

500
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:26,916
I thought Arthur told you.

501
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,485
What did he say?

502
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,922
Just that there's gonna be a wedding.

503
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,830
There can't be no wedding
till Harold asks her...

504
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:43,131
and he ain't asked her yet,
that I know of. Has he asked?

505
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:50,174
No, he's probably waiting on that, too.

506
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:07,896
Frisky, ain't he?

507
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,276
Well, what do you say, Joe Sam?

508
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:21,908
You think it's the black panther?

509
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,361
Joe Sam!

510
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,697
What say?

511
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,297
That's better.

512
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,667
You speak quick when you're spoken to.

513
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,400
You think it's the black panther?

514
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,304
Snow come.

515
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:55,672
Much snow.

516
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,875
Just plain snow
is all he's got on his mind...

517
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,113
and here I was hoping it was the cat.

518
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,217
Don't you play the fool, Curtis.

519
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:07,720
If it starts to snow then you get
yourself home fast as you can.

520
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,884
You wouldn't want me to come home
without a present...

521
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,484
for Gwen's wedding bed, would you?

522
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,292
I'm gonna shoot him right in the eye,
so as I won't spoil the pelt.

523
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,934
Now, what's on your mind, kid?

524
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,970
Tell him, Harold. Don't be afraid.
Tell him.

525
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,242
Ain't a thing on his mind.

526
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,745
The mare must've thrown him.

527
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,777
Must've spooked and threw him.

528
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,679
Come on.

529
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,200
He waited on that rock.

530
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,600
He jumped him from the rock.

531
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,117
Boo, Kentuck.

532
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,917
Easy, boy.

533
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,758
It's Art, boy.

534
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,394
Now hold, you hear?

535
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:02,230
The cat-stink's on him.

536
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,357
Is that it, boy?

537
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,680
Boo, Kentuck.

538
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,846
Boo, boy. Boo, now.

539
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:58,054
Boo, boy.

540
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,112
Boo, now.

541
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:25,148
Boo, boy.

542
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:34,855
Boo, boy.

543
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,953
Get on home, now! Get!

544
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:58,278
I'm gonna get him, Art.
I'm gonna get him.

545
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:48,262
It's Curt!

546
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:51,232
- It's not Arthur. It's Curt.
- Get back to the house.

547
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,266
It's Curt, Mother. It's Curt.

548
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,542
No, it's Arthur.

549
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:31,232
Mother, get back to the house.

550
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,103
Mother!

551
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:35,938
Where's Curt?

552
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:38,281
Why didn't Curt come?

553
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:50,387
Take his feet.

554
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,231
Put him in the north bedroom.

555
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:56,893
I gotta lay him out proper.

556
00:44:57,928 --> 00:44:59,589
You better let me help, Ma.

557
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:01,655
No.

558
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:04,159
You go along.

559
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:10,873
And you better take the whiskey
out of the cupboard.

560
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:13,340
Your pa's drunk enough.

561
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,184
Gwen will fix you some supper, Dad.

562
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,321
No hurry. No hurry at all.

563
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,854
A very attractive,
young woman, Gwen.

564
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:30,757
You're a lucky boy
to get such a woman.

565
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,923
Harold!

566
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,399
His neck's broke.

567
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:43,673
There are claw marks on his shoulders.

568
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:05,787
Where's Curt? It's dark out there.

569
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:07,657
He should've come home with Arthur.

570
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:29,385
You'll have to hole up, too.

571
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,911
I'll get you in the morning.

572
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:44,078
Mother.

573
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,280
Come on out and get some supper.

574
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,350
It's so cold in here.

575
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:53,088
You better put on your shawl.

576
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:56,198
Fetch me my Bible.

577
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,677
He used to talk such foolishness.

578
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:21,385
I was always letting it go in one ear
and out the other...

579
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,291
like you got to do
with Curt's swearing...

580
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,589
knowing it don't mean a thing.

581
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:33,030
But Arthur did mean something,
didn't he?

582
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:40,035
It was mostly Curt and me.

583
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,238
Just the two of us against him.

584
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:47,581
The rest of you was always
going along...

585
00:49:47,582 --> 00:49:49,280
letting him fight your fights.

586
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:52,883
Him alone...

587
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:55,649
against us.

588
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:04,691
He was a strange son
for your pa and me to have.

589
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:10,462
Like the Lord put something in him...

590
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:14,766
that wasn't in either of us.

591
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,813
I been trying to pray.

592
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:25,318
But it don't come right.

593
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:30,654
How's Grace?

594
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,526
She just sits there.

595
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:39,296
She was so foolish fond of him.

596
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:44,435
Curt come home yet?

597
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:46,537
He wouldn't even try in this snow.

598
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:49,169
He probably holed up somewhere
till it's daylight.

599
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:53,972
He must've got a long way out...

600
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:58,087
a long way.

601
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:56,903
Hello.

602
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:58,571
Let me alone, please.

603
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:02,078
This morning,
I think I hate the Bridges.

604
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:03,852
Especially that old man over there.

605
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,479
The things he said to me.

606
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,284
What did he say?

607
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:10,654
What did he say?

608
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:13,762
He's worried about Curt, that's all.
It doesn't matter what he said.

609
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:16,128
Yes, it does! What did he say?

610
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:20,863
He thinks I'm to blame for Arthur
dying, for Curt not coming back.

611
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:23,370
He said
none of it would have happened...

612
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:25,666
if I hadn't made eyes at Curt.

613
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:30,979
Harold!

614
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:37,147
He's so drunk,
he doesn't know what he's saying.

615
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,279
You better go in to your mother.

616
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,196
Is the snow gonna stop?

617
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:53,096
It's let up some.

618
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:57,665
Is there enough boards for the coffin?

619
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:01,167
The lumber Curt got for the tack room.

620
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:04,839
There's the grave to dig yet.

621
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:17,684
Curt?

622
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:22,593
You young fool, chasing out
after panthers in a blizzard.

623
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,560
And was it black?

624
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:26,761
Would you like some breakfast,
Mr. Bridges?

625
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,370
Who is this woman?

626
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:30,197
What's she doing in my house?

627
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:32,397
It's Gwen, Dad.

628
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:35,873
- Gwen?
- Gwendolyn Williams.

629
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:40,772
I have no recollection of a Gwendolyn.

630
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,652
Her name strikes no chord.

631
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:46,717
Oh, yeah.

632
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:48,753
Lou Williams' daughter.

633
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,758
She's a charming girl.

634
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:55,354
I'm surprised at you, Curt,
letting a young whippersnapper like...

635
00:53:58,702 --> 00:53:59,896
Where's Curt?

636
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:02,331
You know where he is.

637
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,553
Where's my bottle?

638
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:21,821
Thieving women.
The place is crawling with them.

639
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:29,389
Curt's out hunting. That's where he is.

640
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,827
He's a great shot.

641
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:36,104
I remember once,
when he was only a youngster...

642
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:38,939
thirteen, fourteen,
somewhere around there...

643
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:42,044
down on old Jay Haley's ranch
on the Carson River...

644
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,778
he won a turkey shoot!

645
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:51,049
You should have seen old Jay's face.

646
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:57,518
Always gets what he's after, that boy.

647
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:02,362
Never gives up till he's got it
right there in his hand.

648
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:06,431
That's a thing for you
to keep in mind, Miss Williams.

649
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:10,071
I beg your pardon, young woman.
I apologize.

650
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:13,301
Inexcusable, absolutely inexcusable.

651
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,406
It's all right, Mr. Bridges.

652
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:17,306
You hear that, Curt?

653
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:19,649
It's all right, she says.

654
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:22,684
You're a lucky boy, Curt.

655
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:28,382
You know,
I keep forgetting he's not here.

656
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:30,950
He's out hunting.

657
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,756
A panther killed Arthur.

658
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:39,628
Only I thought it was Curt.

659
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,936
Why did he take Curt's coat?

660
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:48,668
You keep things from me,
hold secrets in my own house. Why?

661
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:52,173
I know.

662
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,041
I saw him on the bed in there.

663
00:55:58,321 --> 00:55:59,879
A black panther.

664
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:10,163
Dad, why don't you go to bed?

665
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:12,094
Yes, indeed.

666
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:13,926
And get some sleep.

667
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:18,930
Only first, a drop to keep me warm.

668
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:35,350
Please.

669
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:39,961
Next thing,
you'll want to carry me upstairs.

670
00:58:04,944 --> 00:58:06,434
Poor, little fellows.

671
00:58:57,163 --> 00:58:59,188
I wanted to go, and you stopped me...

672
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:01,323
all by yourself.

673
00:59:01,934 --> 00:59:03,526
Nobody did it for you.

674
00:59:04,771 --> 00:59:06,739
Why don't you do that in everything?

675
00:59:10,209 --> 00:59:12,939
You'll kiss me if
I make the first move.

676
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:17,447
You'll be alone with me
if I lead you by the hand.

677
00:59:19,552 --> 00:59:21,918
You keep standing back with me...

678
00:59:22,121 --> 00:59:24,453
with your mother, and with Curt.

679
00:59:25,725 --> 00:59:28,922
Arthur used to speak up for you,
but Arthur's dead now.

680
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:32,797
What do you want?

681
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,896
Isn't there anything
you want enough to ask for it?

682
00:59:37,437 --> 00:59:40,429
Are you afraid to ask Curt
for what's rightfully yours?

683
00:59:41,574 --> 00:59:43,940
There wouldn't be any ranch
if it wasn't for Curt.

684
00:59:44,143 --> 00:59:46,737
Squatters would have
taken it away from us a long time ago...

685
00:59:46,846 --> 00:59:48,143
but he drove them out.

686
00:59:48,981 --> 00:59:51,006
It was all finished
by the time I grew up.

687
00:59:51,784 --> 00:59:53,547
He did it all by himself.

688
00:59:54,287 --> 00:59:57,313
It just doesn't seem fair for me
to get married and move in on him...

689
00:59:57,423 --> 00:59:58,890
and demand my share.

690
00:59:59,258 --> 01:00:00,987
He's got to offer it to me.

691
01:00:09,168 --> 01:00:10,328
Gwen?

692
01:00:10,603 --> 01:00:11,695
Gwen?

693
01:00:39,131 --> 01:00:40,962
Joe Sam, take that end.

694
01:00:43,102 --> 01:00:44,296
Joe Sam!

695
01:01:36,789 --> 01:01:38,780
I seen you up there with her.

696
01:01:39,392 --> 01:01:42,592
I couldn't help seeing her
forcing herself on you,...

697
01:01:42,593 --> 01:01:44,193
right there in plain sight.

698
01:01:45,398 --> 01:01:47,866
And your brother ain't in his grave yet.

699
01:01:49,502 --> 01:01:51,197
Little mucker's brat!

700
01:01:51,437 --> 01:01:53,337
And that ain't the least of what she is.

701
01:01:53,439 --> 01:01:57,398
I never been one to mince words,
but I wouldn't dirty my mouth naming her.

702
01:01:57,610 --> 01:02:00,044
You bring her into this house
knowing what she is.

703
01:02:00,212 --> 01:02:01,645
I'd send her packing this minute...

704
01:02:01,747 --> 01:02:04,147
- bag and baggage, only I won't...
- Take me home!

705
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:05,417
Harold!

706
01:02:05,518 --> 01:02:07,577
You'll do no such thing.
You'll finish the coffin.

707
01:02:07,687 --> 01:02:09,120
With Curt gone,
you'll dig the grave, too.

708
01:02:09,221 --> 01:02:10,210
She can make the...

709
01:02:10,323 --> 01:02:12,086
Never mind.
I'll go, and I won't need his help.

710
01:02:12,224 --> 01:02:14,089
Mother, you're making
a filthy lie out of nothing.

711
01:02:14,193 --> 01:02:15,182
What's she done, anyway?

712
01:02:15,294 --> 01:02:17,387
You're always talking
as if you were God around here.

713
01:02:17,496 --> 01:02:18,690
Don't blaspheme!

714
01:02:19,498 --> 01:02:21,193
Me, blaspheme?

715
01:02:21,601 --> 01:02:23,967
This house is rotten with
the gods you've made.

716
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:25,831
Yours and Curt's.

717
01:02:26,272 --> 01:02:28,433
With pride and money and greed.

718
01:02:29,075 --> 01:02:30,565
See here, Grace.

719
01:02:31,143 --> 01:02:34,408
You can squint your eyes at me,
but you can't frighten me.

720
01:02:34,614 --> 01:02:37,981
Think how happy Curt was
when he found Arthur out there.

721
01:02:38,317 --> 01:02:39,750
He's been robbing him for years...

722
01:02:39,852 --> 01:02:42,616
taking his share,
time after time with your blessing.

723
01:02:43,689 --> 01:02:45,987
"To improve the ranch," he says.

724
01:02:46,192 --> 01:02:47,489
His ranch.

725
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:50,922
They've got you believing in it, too.
You believe them.

726
01:02:52,932 --> 01:02:54,229
Arthur's dead.

727
01:02:54,934 --> 01:02:57,129
You don't seem to know
what that means.

728
01:02:57,670 --> 01:02:58,819
It was Arthur who kept Curt...

729
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:00,969
from selling this place
right out from under us.

730
01:03:01,273 --> 01:03:03,764
Curt was afraid of him,
but now he's dead.

731
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:05,939
And Curt has everything his way.

732
01:03:06,512 --> 01:03:10,471
And all with the blessings of Mother's
wicked, selfish, ugly gods!

733
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:12,351
What's going on down there?

734
01:03:12,685 --> 01:03:15,848
What's going on, I say?
All this screaming.

735
01:03:16,622 --> 01:03:19,216
Ask Mother. She's the one.

736
01:03:20,192 --> 01:03:22,854
Your daughter's screaming
blasphemous nonsense.

737
01:03:23,295 --> 01:03:25,126
Holy, holy, holy!

738
01:03:25,297 --> 01:03:26,958
We've listened to
about enough of this.

739
01:03:27,099 --> 01:03:28,293
You get back in that bedroom...

740
01:03:28,401 --> 01:03:31,029
and stay there until you can
keep a decent tongue in your head.

741
01:03:31,303 --> 01:03:33,396
Listen to her,
with her righteousness.

742
01:03:33,539 --> 01:03:35,302
She's sending Gwen home.

743
01:03:35,841 --> 01:03:38,366
Grace, get back in that room,
you hear?

744
01:03:38,477 --> 01:03:40,104
- Sending her home?
- Yes, yes, yes.

745
01:03:40,212 --> 01:03:42,043
What are you sending her
home for, Letty?

746
01:03:42,948 --> 01:03:44,142
Ask her.

747
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:47,318
Go on, ask her. She's the eye of God,
she sees everything.

748
01:03:47,486 --> 01:03:49,044
What did you see, Letty?

749
01:03:50,523 --> 01:03:51,785
Awful things.

750
01:03:53,726 --> 01:03:56,490
Let me go. I want to go.
Please, let me go.

751
01:03:57,196 --> 01:03:58,254
You...

752
01:03:58,597 --> 01:03:59,996
You and your Bible.

753
01:04:00,399 --> 01:04:01,780
For all your reading, it's amazing...

754
01:04:01,781 --> 01:04:03,562
how little you understand.

755
01:04:04,036 --> 01:04:06,937
You dirty everything
with your nasty mind.

756
01:04:08,574 --> 01:04:09,734
I seen you.

757
01:04:14,346 --> 01:04:15,870
The little one.

758
01:04:16,082 --> 01:04:17,481
Curt's intended.

759
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:20,813
He's out hunting cats, and he's got
one right here waiting for him.

760
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,046
What did you see?

761
01:04:22,221 --> 01:04:23,916
Tell him, Mother.
You're the one who saw them.

762
01:04:24,123 --> 01:04:25,488
What did you see?

763
01:04:26,192 --> 01:04:28,717
They was acting up in the shed.

764
01:04:29,161 --> 01:04:30,890
Acting? Like what?

765
01:04:31,197 --> 01:04:33,290
She was kissing him
the way no decent...

766
01:04:33,399 --> 01:04:35,765
Kissing him? She was kissing him!

767
01:04:36,168 --> 01:04:38,693
Hot diggity! I wish I'd seen that!

768
01:04:39,071 --> 01:04:41,266
Now, you listen to me, old woman.

769
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,369
Kissing's what we need around here.

770
01:04:43,576 --> 01:04:44,668
Lots of kissing!

771
01:04:44,777 --> 01:04:46,870
The more kissing, the better.

772
01:04:47,313 --> 01:04:48,507
I could use a few myself.

773
01:04:48,814 --> 01:04:51,339
Never had enough,
far back as I remember.

774
01:04:51,851 --> 01:04:54,945
Clear beyond recollection,
that's how long the need's been.

775
01:04:55,955 --> 01:04:59,447
You with your stingy little purse
of a mouth.

776
01:04:59,959 --> 01:05:01,392
Did you watch them?

777
01:05:01,727 --> 01:05:03,285
Did you learn anything?

778
01:05:08,167 --> 01:05:12,194
I wish you thieving females would
leave my bottle alone.

779
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:23,380
Clothespin, that's what you are.

780
01:05:23,816 --> 01:05:26,842
Always have been a clothespin,
always will be a clothespin.

781
01:05:27,353 --> 01:05:30,550
I've got to keep drunk to forget
I'm married to a clothespin.

782
01:05:30,756 --> 01:05:32,621
Is that all it means to you?

783
01:05:33,058 --> 01:05:36,687
After a lifetime of slaving and looking
after you and bearing young ones?

784
01:05:36,796 --> 01:05:38,127
That's all it means.

785
01:05:38,364 --> 01:05:40,423
You want a woman
like that in your house.

786
01:05:40,866 --> 01:05:42,299
Why not?

787
01:05:42,401 --> 01:05:43,698
You're here, aren't you?

788
01:05:44,069 --> 01:05:46,401
- Make her apologize, Father.
- Oh, shut up.

789
01:05:46,605 --> 01:05:48,732
Clothespins, both of you.

790
01:05:48,841 --> 01:05:50,069
You're not human.

791
01:05:51,677 --> 01:05:52,939
She's human.

792
01:05:53,179 --> 01:05:55,170
No clothespin at all.

793
01:05:56,215 --> 01:05:59,412
If she is,
she's a mighty pretty clothespin.

794
01:06:00,853 --> 01:06:02,343
Curt's bride.

795
01:06:08,127 --> 01:06:10,493
We mustn't let Mother
send Gwen away, Father.

796
01:06:10,596 --> 01:06:12,894
She has to apologize,
or Gwen will go away.

797
01:06:12,998 --> 01:06:15,398
Of course not. I said so, didn't I?

798
01:06:15,668 --> 01:06:16,896
Curt's intended.

799
01:06:17,369 --> 01:06:18,495
Harold's, Father.

800
01:06:19,438 --> 01:06:23,067
That's right. Not Curt's, Harold's.

801
01:06:25,911 --> 01:06:27,708
Too much woman for Harold.

802
01:06:29,281 --> 01:06:31,112
I'm going away,
and you can't stop me.

803
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:33,150
If you don't let me
take a horse, I'll walk.

804
01:06:33,419 --> 01:06:35,216
When your back is turned,
I'll get away.

805
01:06:35,387 --> 01:06:36,445
Gwen...

806
01:06:37,223 --> 01:06:38,315
Gwen!

807
01:06:38,691 --> 01:06:39,680
Gwen!

808
01:06:39,792 --> 01:06:41,760
Is that all you can say?

809
01:06:42,628 --> 01:06:45,096
You're not going anyplace,
not even when my back's turned!

810
01:06:45,531 --> 01:06:47,692
I've had enough trouble
without any more out of you!

811
01:06:47,867 --> 01:06:49,528
You're staying till I dig the grave.

812
01:06:50,769 --> 01:06:53,966
Get over in the bunkhouse and wait.
When I'm finished, I'll take you home.

813
01:09:27,526 --> 01:09:29,050
Well, what do you know?

814
01:09:29,361 --> 01:09:30,885
I beat you here, didn't I?

815
01:09:31,163 --> 01:09:32,323
You bet I did.

816
01:09:33,932 --> 01:09:35,991
You're not dealing
with Art this time.

817
01:09:36,235 --> 01:09:39,102
He just never could learn
to stop mooning.

818
01:09:40,205 --> 01:09:42,139
I'm gonna put one
right between your eyes...

819
01:09:42,241 --> 01:09:43,299
and I'm gonna skin you...

820
01:09:43,409 --> 01:09:45,434
and I'm gonna lay
your pelt cozy in her lap.

821
01:09:46,745 --> 01:09:48,508
She'll get her blanket, all right.

822
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:50,710
And I'm gonna charge her for it.

823
01:09:51,283 --> 01:09:52,875
Don't you think I won't.

824
01:09:53,419 --> 01:09:55,319
My own price, and no tricks.

825
01:09:58,724 --> 01:10:01,784
I got all the time in the world.
I got lots of time.

826
01:10:02,394 --> 01:10:04,521
I got enough grub
to last me for a week...

827
01:10:50,542 --> 01:10:53,340
"When I have fears
that I may cease to be"

828
01:11:00,052 --> 01:11:02,885
I've gotta get home.
I've gotta get home.

829
01:11:05,491 --> 01:11:06,822
Now just take it easy.

830
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:09,854
You'll get home.

831
01:11:10,229 --> 01:11:11,662
You're all right.

832
01:11:12,231 --> 01:11:13,596
You've got a good fire.

833
01:11:14,666 --> 01:11:16,463
You're not out there in the cold.

834
01:11:17,035 --> 01:11:18,696
It's bound to let up soon.

835
01:11:20,372 --> 01:11:21,839
You're not lost.

836
01:12:40,152 --> 01:12:43,053
I'm worried about
your father and Grace...

837
01:12:44,189 --> 01:12:46,987
and your mother,
alone in that cold room.

838
01:12:47,593 --> 01:12:48,719
They'll be all right.

839
01:12:50,162 --> 01:12:52,221
Somebody has to take care of them.

840
01:12:52,898 --> 01:12:54,889
Not you. It'll only cause trouble.

841
01:12:55,767 --> 01:12:57,530
You wait here.
I'll get your things.

842
01:13:07,312 --> 01:13:08,574
We're going now.

843
01:13:13,852 --> 01:13:15,376
He's taking Gwen home.

844
01:13:15,954 --> 01:13:17,785
Mother, tell him he can't go.

845
01:13:18,557 --> 01:13:20,184
Have you finished the grave?

846
01:13:20,325 --> 01:13:22,885
- Up on the hill.
- No, you can't go. Tell him, Mother.

847
01:13:24,563 --> 01:13:25,996
Bring her here.

848
01:13:27,099 --> 01:13:28,225
If that's what you want.

849
01:13:28,634 --> 01:13:30,261
She wants to go home.

850
01:13:31,336 --> 01:13:33,319
Mother,
I said a lot of terrible things.

851
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,102
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

852
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,668
Oh, I am.

853
01:13:37,042 --> 01:13:38,873
You'll say that much to Gwen,
won't you?

854
01:13:38,977 --> 01:13:40,205
That you're sorry.

855
01:13:40,312 --> 01:13:41,745
Then Harold won't have to go.

856
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:44,876
No, Harold! Please!
I'll go get Gwen.

857
01:13:44,983 --> 01:13:47,508
Mother will tell her she's sorry.
You will, won't you?

858
01:13:47,619 --> 01:13:49,314
Yes, she will!

859
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:54,491
You'd leave us
with everything the way it is.

860
01:13:58,697 --> 01:14:00,426
I'm half out of my mind...

861
01:14:01,166 --> 01:14:03,327
thinking something's happened to Curt.

862
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:07,029
I got the coffin lined...

863
01:14:07,539 --> 01:14:08,972
ready for Arthur.

864
01:14:09,241 --> 01:14:11,471
- I'll be back tomorrow.
- It can't wait.

865
01:14:12,077 --> 01:14:14,238
You can't put it off until tomorrow.

866
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,375
You've got to do it now.

867
01:14:26,091 --> 01:14:28,252
Joe Sam...

868
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,725
help Harold.

869
01:14:30,329 --> 01:14:31,591
Evening, everybody!

870
01:14:31,697 --> 01:14:34,825
- Good evening. Good evening.
- Go to bed.

871
01:14:34,933 --> 01:14:36,059
Bed?

872
01:14:36,768 --> 01:14:40,568
Oh, this decrepit old body
is already galled with sleep.

873
01:14:41,506 --> 01:14:43,098
What I want is a drink.

874
01:14:46,478 --> 01:14:48,309
Where's my bottle?

875
01:14:48,413 --> 01:14:52,372
Some thieving female's
stolen my bottle.

876
01:14:57,155 --> 01:15:00,147
The one true friend of man.

877
01:15:02,728 --> 01:15:04,093
Warm, too.

878
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:15,536
Wrap him...

879
01:15:16,274 --> 01:15:18,765
in that black-and-white spread.

880
01:15:19,878 --> 01:15:22,904
He was always partial to it
when he was a little feller.

881
01:15:24,249 --> 01:15:25,546
He used to...

882
01:15:25,984 --> 01:15:30,944
run his fingers over the trees
and the birds and beasts.

883
01:15:31,857 --> 01:15:34,291
Like he was drawing them himself.

884
01:15:38,597 --> 01:15:40,588
I'd like we should have a preacher.

885
01:15:42,334 --> 01:15:43,892
Not much chance of that.

886
01:15:46,605 --> 01:15:49,369
You should do the talking by rights.

887
01:15:59,651 --> 01:16:01,881
Where is Curt? Where is that boy?

888
01:16:01,987 --> 01:16:03,579
He should be back.

889
01:16:04,022 --> 01:16:05,819
When is he coming back?

890
01:16:17,936 --> 01:16:19,062
Joe Sam.

891
01:16:21,807 --> 01:16:23,240
Joe Sam!

892
01:17:45,457 --> 01:17:48,426
You done real good,
picking this spot, Harold.

893
01:17:48,994 --> 01:17:50,461
It's close to home.

894
01:17:55,901 --> 01:17:57,664
I guess you'd better put him in.

895
01:18:33,705 --> 01:18:37,038
Everybody pray
according to your own heart.

896
01:18:52,724 --> 01:18:54,157
Amen.

897
01:19:02,667 --> 01:19:04,931
Can't preach no proper sermon.

898
01:19:05,604 --> 01:19:07,663
Don't seem much use if I could.

899
01:19:11,743 --> 01:19:13,734
He was a hard one to know.

900
01:19:14,412 --> 01:19:18,542
Even if I could make out clear
every last thing about him...

901
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:20,015
body and soul...

902
01:19:20,652 --> 01:19:22,279
had words to tell...

903
01:19:23,355 --> 01:19:24,947
don't know as it would help.

904
01:19:28,326 --> 01:19:30,157
If the Lord won't judge him...

905
01:19:30,729 --> 01:19:32,993
surely ain't my place to judge.

906
01:19:34,466 --> 01:19:35,990
He was a good man...

907
01:19:36,234 --> 01:19:37,758
like he was a good boy.

908
01:19:38,436 --> 01:19:40,404
Not a mean streak in him.

909
01:19:43,775 --> 01:19:46,209
All the things I could say...

910
01:19:47,178 --> 01:19:50,614
seems to me I could've said them
when he was alive.

911
01:21:08,893 --> 01:21:09,882
Mother...

912
01:21:10,361 --> 01:21:11,760
we're going now.

913
01:21:13,998 --> 01:21:15,556
When will you be back?

914
01:21:23,942 --> 01:21:26,672
I've decided to stay
with Gwen's folks.

915
01:21:27,178 --> 01:21:28,475
They want me to.

916
01:21:31,449 --> 01:21:33,178
Oh, I'm glad! I'm glad!

917
01:21:33,284 --> 01:21:35,184
What will you do in Aspen?

918
01:21:36,755 --> 01:21:39,519
Work in the mines, like her pa?

919
01:21:40,992 --> 01:21:44,553
Bury yourself in the ground
before your time?

920
01:21:44,796 --> 01:21:46,024
He's buried here.

921
01:21:46,197 --> 01:21:47,528
We all are.

922
01:21:48,299 --> 01:21:50,824
But you'll be happy,
that's what counts.

923
01:21:51,302 --> 01:21:53,532
You'd better go before
she changes your mind.

924
01:21:59,878 --> 01:22:01,004
Dad, I...

925
01:22:01,846 --> 01:22:03,473
Look at me blubbering.

926
01:22:04,549 --> 01:22:05,573
Why?

927
01:22:06,084 --> 01:22:07,915
Because Arthur's dead?

928
01:22:08,586 --> 01:22:11,719
If I could shed
this garment flesh...

929
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,853
and die, too, I'd rejoice.

930
01:22:13,958 --> 01:22:14,947
Yes, I would.

931
01:22:15,693 --> 01:22:19,459
This body of mine hangs on, festering.

932
01:22:22,467 --> 01:22:23,525
Well...

933
01:22:24,068 --> 01:22:25,933
my little congregation.

934
01:22:27,906 --> 01:22:29,396
In the Good Book...

935
01:22:29,841 --> 01:22:33,641
Psalms, 63rd chapter,
seventh verse...

936
01:22:34,345 --> 01:22:35,676
David said:

937
01:22:36,114 --> 01:22:40,312
"Therefore in the shadow of thy wings
will I rejoice."

938
01:22:41,553 --> 01:22:44,044
And Arthur is in
the shadow of his wings.

939
01:22:45,056 --> 01:22:46,921
Curt, too, for all I know.

940
01:22:49,661 --> 01:22:52,721
You never thought I read
the Good Book, did you?

941
01:22:53,164 --> 01:22:54,358
Well, I do...

942
01:22:54,666 --> 01:22:57,897
and not with the
tip of my finger, either.

943
01:22:59,437 --> 01:23:03,498
"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord,"
David said.

944
01:23:03,608 --> 01:23:06,202
And that's what I'm going to do,
make a joyful noise.

945
01:23:06,978 --> 01:23:08,343
I will sing!

946
01:23:08,446 --> 01:23:12,212
<i>Ev'ry time I feel the spirit

947
01:23:12,317 --> 01:23:15,218
<i>Moving in my heart, I will pray

948
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,287
Hush up!

949
01:23:16,387 --> 01:23:18,252
<i>Ev'ry time I</i>

950
01:23:19,457 --> 01:23:20,788
Sacrilege...

951
01:23:21,559 --> 01:23:22,890
you do.

952
01:23:23,695 --> 01:23:25,060
One son dead...

953
01:23:26,431 --> 01:23:27,762
maybe two.

954
01:23:28,833 --> 01:23:30,824
The last one abandoning us...

955
01:23:31,769 --> 01:23:32,963
and you sing.

956
01:23:33,271 --> 01:23:34,670
What's that you say?

957
01:23:34,772 --> 01:23:36,399
We're being abandoned...

958
01:23:36,608 --> 01:23:38,075
that's what we are.

959
01:23:39,477 --> 01:23:41,502
Harold's going to live in Aspen.

960
01:23:44,315 --> 01:23:45,805
Don't listen to her, Harold.

961
01:23:47,185 --> 01:23:49,813
If Curt ain't back by this afternoon...

962
01:23:51,689 --> 01:23:53,884
somebody's got to build a fire...

963
01:23:54,626 --> 01:23:55,854
to guide him home.

964
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:57,627
Let Joe Sam do it!

965
01:23:58,162 --> 01:23:59,720
Oh, sure.

966
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,725
Joe Sam's so fond of Curt.

967
01:24:05,503 --> 01:24:07,562
Then Dad will do it.
It's not up to Harold.

968
01:24:09,274 --> 01:24:10,901
Of course.

969
01:24:11,809 --> 01:24:14,209
Why didn't I think of that myself?

970
01:24:15,246 --> 01:24:16,543
Dad will do it.

971
01:24:17,181 --> 01:24:20,776
<i>Ev'ry time I feel the spirit</i>

972
01:24:20,885 --> 01:24:21,874
<i>Moving in my heart</i>

973
01:24:21,986 --> 01:24:23,453
Shut up!

974
01:24:26,190 --> 01:24:27,384
Go.

975
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:30,887
You're free to go.

976
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:34,421
We're no concern of yours...

977
01:24:34,866 --> 01:24:36,026
anymore.

978
01:24:36,968 --> 01:24:38,595
If you don't go now, you never will.

979
01:24:38,703 --> 01:24:40,000
You know that, don't you?

980
01:24:40,338 --> 01:24:42,363
I could've gone once. I never did.

981
01:24:42,774 --> 01:24:44,105
Look at me now.

982
01:24:45,476 --> 01:24:46,990
If he had the courage,
he'd tell you...

983
01:24:46,991 --> 01:24:49,105
he doesn't feel any different
than Joe Sam.

984
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:52,140
Why don't you tell her
you don't want to build a fire?

985
01:24:56,654 --> 01:24:58,019
But he will.

986
01:25:08,066 --> 01:25:09,624
Come on, Joe Sam.

987
01:25:36,861 --> 01:25:38,692
Thieving women.

988
01:27:04,048 --> 01:27:05,345
Easy, boy.

989
01:27:05,983 --> 01:27:08,349
Nothing will start a cat
quicker than running.

990
01:28:52,123 --> 01:28:53,852
"When I have fears"

991
01:29:02,033 --> 01:29:05,332
"When I have fears
that I may cease to be"

992
01:29:43,741 --> 01:29:46,904
The only time any good ever came
of your mooning, boy.

993
01:31:55,306 --> 01:31:56,568
Harold.

994
01:32:15,493 --> 01:32:16,619
Harold?

995
01:32:20,464 --> 01:32:21,590
Harold?

996
01:32:24,235 --> 01:32:25,725
Do you have to answer?

997
01:32:26,771 --> 01:32:27,999
What do you want?

998
01:32:28,172 --> 01:32:30,663
Go put some more wood on the fire!

999
01:32:31,542 --> 01:32:32,668
All right!

1000
01:33:38,642 --> 01:33:39,700
Harold?

1001
01:33:40,411 --> 01:33:41,537
Some bedspread...

1002
01:33:42,346 --> 01:33:44,439
The black-and-white one
we put around Arthur.

1003
01:33:44,548 --> 01:33:46,106
Wake up, Harold.

1004
01:33:49,053 --> 01:33:50,816
Darling, you were talking
in your sleep.

1005
01:33:52,656 --> 01:33:53,850
What did I say?

1006
01:33:54,425 --> 01:33:55,619
Nothing.

1007
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:59,124
Your mother wants to see you.
She's worried about Curt.

1008
01:34:08,439 --> 01:34:09,963
I dreamed we were up in the valley...

1009
01:34:11,575 --> 01:34:13,406
you and Arthur and me.

1010
01:34:14,812 --> 01:34:16,109
It was beautiful.

1011
01:34:17,248 --> 01:34:18,840
Curt wasn't with us.

1012
01:34:20,217 --> 01:34:21,411
Then he was...

1013
01:34:21,685 --> 01:34:23,243
and everything changed.

1014
01:34:27,658 --> 01:34:29,057
Did you want me, Mother?

1015
01:34:29,827 --> 01:34:31,055
Sit down.

1016
01:34:33,864 --> 01:34:35,354
The fire's gone down.

1017
01:34:35,566 --> 01:34:37,090
You let it go down.

1018
01:34:37,601 --> 01:34:38,863
It's getting daybreak, Ma.

1019
01:34:39,003 --> 01:34:43,030
Getting breakfast all ready,
young woman? That's fine!

1020
01:34:43,908 --> 01:34:45,705
I can do with a good breakfast.

1021
01:34:46,110 --> 01:34:47,805
Where's Harold disappeared to?

1022
01:34:47,912 --> 01:34:49,743
Has he gone out looking for Curt?

1023
01:34:51,482 --> 01:34:53,313
I just keep wondering.

1024
01:34:56,086 --> 01:35:01,046
Seems like I ain't seen a thing
clear for what it really was.

1025
01:35:04,929 --> 01:35:07,557
Your pa didn't want
to come out here...

1026
01:35:08,499 --> 01:35:10,558
clear in the middle of no place.

1027
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:16,467
Sometimes I think
it's worse for Grace.

1028
01:35:19,243 --> 01:35:22,178
A woman's meant
to have her man and children.

1029
01:35:23,747 --> 01:35:27,478
Without she's got them, she ain't
able to come to herself rightly.

1030
01:35:28,552 --> 01:35:30,679
Why doesn't he go if he's going?

1031
01:35:31,422 --> 01:35:35,984
His own brother out there,
lost God knows where.

1032
01:35:36,627 --> 01:35:40,961
He sleeps all night on the table
like some drunk in a backroom.

1033
01:35:42,299 --> 01:35:44,824
Curt's the only man in the lot.

1034
01:35:51,442 --> 01:35:53,342
I've done wrong.

1035
01:36:03,854 --> 01:36:06,220
Curt has to come home.

1036
01:36:07,725 --> 01:36:11,058
He can't die with my sin on his soul.

1037
01:36:13,263 --> 01:36:14,696
It was my doing.

1038
01:36:16,934 --> 01:36:18,629
Whatever he done...

1039
01:36:20,738 --> 01:36:22,467
he done to please me.

1040
01:36:25,643 --> 01:36:26,701
Don't worry, Ma.

1041
01:36:28,178 --> 01:36:29,440
I'll go out.

1042
01:36:30,681 --> 01:36:32,148
I'll find him.

1043
01:36:35,819 --> 01:36:38,447
"Behold, thou art fair, my love...

1044
01:36:38,555 --> 01:36:40,284
"behold, thou art fair...

1045
01:36:40,891 --> 01:36:43,826
"thou has doves' eyes
within thy locks."

1046
01:36:43,927 --> 01:36:47,454
Please, Mr. Bridges, eat your breakfast
before it gets cold.

1047
01:36:51,969 --> 01:36:56,133
Not only can she cook,
she's a comfort to an aging heart.

1048
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:58,431
She's the rose of Sharon.

1049
01:37:00,678 --> 01:37:02,509
It's daybreak.
I'd better get started.

1050
01:37:02,613 --> 01:37:03,944
Before it gets too late.

1051
01:37:05,683 --> 01:37:07,173
I thought I'd take a run up
Creek Canyon.

1052
01:37:07,284 --> 01:37:08,581
Maybe take a look up top.

1053
01:37:08,686 --> 01:37:12,178
- You'll get lost in all that snow.
- Take Joe Sam with you.

1054
01:37:12,556 --> 01:37:15,616
He can read signs where nobody else
would see a thing.

1055
01:37:15,726 --> 01:37:17,523
Now you take Joe Sam.

1056
01:37:18,195 --> 01:37:20,026
I'll rest easier in my soul.

1057
01:37:20,464 --> 01:37:21,988
And what do you think you'll find?

1058
01:37:22,766 --> 01:37:25,326
Well he's gonna find Curt
and bring him back.

1059
01:37:26,537 --> 01:37:29,097
You want him to find Curt,
don't you, Grace?

1060
01:37:31,041 --> 01:37:33,134
It's so peaceful here without him.

1061
01:37:34,411 --> 01:37:36,675
Things will be the same as always
when he gets back.

1062
01:37:40,117 --> 01:37:43,712
Yes, I want Harold to find him.

1063
01:37:44,822 --> 01:37:46,221
Of course, you do.

1064
01:37:46,323 --> 01:37:47,449
He's your born brother.

1065
01:37:48,826 --> 01:37:50,453
But now, you got to believe.

1066
01:37:50,728 --> 01:37:52,923
You got to believe
the same as I believe...

1067
01:37:53,030 --> 01:37:54,930
that Curt's out there somewhere...

1068
01:37:55,032 --> 01:37:56,761
or you won't half look.

1069
01:37:57,568 --> 01:37:58,967
You're the same as Dad...

1070
01:37:59,937 --> 01:38:02,064
only you use hope instead of whiskey.

1071
01:38:03,273 --> 01:38:05,138
He's been out there three days.

1072
01:38:06,477 --> 01:38:08,707
I been thinking pretty near all night.

1073
01:38:10,681 --> 01:38:12,273
I got a feeling...

1074
01:38:13,484 --> 01:38:14,678
he's alive.

1075
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:16,643
He might have gone way back in.

1076
01:38:17,054 --> 01:38:19,545
The cat would head for the high
country with somebody after him.

1077
01:38:20,290 --> 01:38:23,191
Well now, don't you go looking
for that panther, Harold.

1078
01:38:23,861 --> 01:38:26,022
Don't get led on past sense.

1079
01:38:26,797 --> 01:38:29,459
Start back with enough daylight
to get you home.

1080
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:33,400
If you ain't done no good by noon,
you head on back.

1081
01:38:34,872 --> 01:38:38,399
No good risking yourself, you hear?

1082
01:38:42,079 --> 01:38:43,171
Promise.

1083
01:39:09,473 --> 01:39:12,840
Panther not kill Curt.

1084
01:39:14,478 --> 01:39:15,740
Night...

1085
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:17,204
dark...

1086
01:39:17,548 --> 01:39:19,345
Curt afraid.

1087
01:39:20,751 --> 01:39:22,116
He run.

1088
01:39:24,087 --> 01:39:25,679
What was he running from?

1089
01:39:29,693 --> 01:39:31,923
In him.

1090
01:40:07,564 --> 01:40:10,465
You want I go?

1091
01:40:12,669 --> 01:40:13,795
No.

1092
01:40:55,879 --> 01:40:57,710
Curt not kill.

1093
01:40:58,482 --> 01:40:59,813
You kill.

1094
01:41:01,385 --> 01:41:03,285
Him devil.

1095
01:41:03,887 --> 01:41:05,320
The black panther?

1096
01:41:05,622 --> 01:41:06,589
No.

1097
01:41:07,257 --> 01:41:08,588
Not black...

1098
01:41:09,326 --> 01:41:10,623
black panther.

1099
01:41:11,428 --> 01:41:12,793
Whole world.

1100
01:41:20,871 --> 01:41:22,338
Got good blanket...

1101
01:41:22,739 --> 01:41:24,366
for bed now.

1102
01:41:25,609 --> 01:41:27,975
You get married, huh?

1103
01:41:28,345 --> 01:41:30,506
Maybe. That's up to her.

1104
01:41:31,848 --> 01:41:33,247
She marry.

1105
01:41:33,483 --> 01:41:34,677
No more trouble.

1106
01:41:35,419 --> 01:41:37,114
You boss man, now.
