1
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,264
Poetry, Sergeant Fitzsimmons?

2
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,685
Yes?

3
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,014
Sir, Junior Frisbee just rode in.

4
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,716
Oh. Well, have one of the men
keep an eye on him as usual.

5
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,088
His thieving, murdering partner
with him, I presume?

6
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:45,595
- In a matter of speaking, sir.
- How's that?

7
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:49,929
Ugh.

8
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:20,788
This here dirty old bag of bones
was my partner for 30 years.

9
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,628
And do you know what he is now?

10
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,500
He's dead, that's what he is.

11
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,266
Now, what do you gotta say
about that?

12
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,910
Well, I'd say bury him, Junior.

13
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,746
You don't even care who done it,
do you?

14
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,342
- No, I don't.
- Well, I'll tell you who done it.

15
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:39,542
Baker done it.

16
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,653
And you don't care why he done it,
do you?

17
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:43,888
I can't say I do, Junior.

18
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,023
Well, all Bill did here
was kick his dog.

19
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:52,631
Just kicked his damn dog and Baker
laid him out for the pearly gates.

20
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,597
And you're not gonna do
a damn thing about it, are you?

21
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,259
- Nope.
- How come?

22
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,134
Ain't it your job to protect folks?

23
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,172
And ain't it your job to protect

24
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:07,746
good, clean, decent, white folks
from the heathens?

25
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,611
Well, ain't it?

26
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,615
Well, I'd say he looks healthier

27
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,657
than the last time I saw him, Junior.

28
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,126
How can he look healthier
when he's dead?

29
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,288
Must agree with him.

30
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,997
We was talking about protection.

31
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:34,128
Well, how many people would you say
he's killed during his miserable life?

32
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,969
Well, none that didn't deserve it.

33
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,873
- How many have you killed, Junior?
- None that didn't deserve it.

34
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,037
Me and Bill was very particular
about that.

35
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,308
We never killed church folks neither.

36
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:48,284
Of course, there was a Baptist that
got in the way once, but very seldom.

37
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,580
Yeah.

38
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,781
Well, you ought to bury him.

39
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,587
All you got to say.

40
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,195
Do you know what I'm gonna do?

41
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:00,457
I'm gonna write a letter to Washington
about you.

42
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,032
Yes, sir.

43
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,725
And what?

44
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,837
Well, I'm gonna find somebody
that can write for me.

45
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,667
Somebody with a fine, delicate hand

46
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:12,106
because that's all they understand
in Washington.

47
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:16,146
I'm gonna write a letter.
You wait and see if I don't.

48
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,408
Sergeant, see that poor Bill

49
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,608
- is underground before dark.
- Yes, sir.

50
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,651
Flies are getting bad.
- Yes, sir.

51
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:27,985
It's getting so decent folks
can't move in this country without...

52
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,793
getting killed or...

53
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,335
Thirty years, sergeant,
and my wife will be coming

54
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,971
through the gate any day now.

55
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,332
She wants to make sure
I retire this time. Ahem.

56
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,501
- Get Bookbinder in here.
- Yes, sir.

57
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,620
Frisbee's out there telling how

58
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,986
he's aiming to write a letter
to Washington.

59
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,594
Yes, yes, a fine, delicate letter.

60
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,754
Very fine and very delicate
because that's what...

61
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,730
That's what they understand
in Washington. Yes, yes, I know.

62
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,870
We haven't heard anything of Baker in
four or five months. What's he up to?

63
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,562
It's hard to keep up with him.

64
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,437
Him and them he rides with
is always on the move.

65
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,869
He travels with a dog.

66
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,879
- How's that?
- I said he travels with a dog.

67
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,246
Well, why did you tell me
he travels with a dog?

68
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,149
Well, I don't know why I told you.
I just told you, that's all.

69
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,222
I didn't mean for you
to get put out none.

70
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,453
All right. All right.
Where does he make his base?

71
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,288
He ain't got none.

72
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:39,898
Gets around like a fever
and lives on a rock.

73
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,327
Word has it,
he's planning something big.

74
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,970
- Something what?
- Something big. That's all I heard.

75
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,674
Ahem. Bookbinder,

76
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,367
- you do work for us, do you not?
- Right.

77
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,378
You are employed by
the United States Cavalry as a scout,

78
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,244
- am I right or wrong?
- Scout. Cavalry. Yeah.

79
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:02,042
Well, then get out.
Do some scouting, find out something.

80
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,451
Find out what Baker
is planning to do.

81
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,881
Well, if we were gonna talk,
why couldn't we have met

82
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,118
at Bad Water
or some civilized place?

83
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,493
I could get shot in a civilized place,
Baker.

84
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,223
Folks treat me like an animal.

85
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:56,792
What do you want?

86
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,029
Heard you were planning
something big.

87
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,734
Where'd you hear that?

88
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,268
On the wind.

89
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,908
You ought to stay out of the wind,
Cobb, or you could catch your death.

90
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,110
Never mind. We heard it.

91
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,243
So?

92
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,782
I could get my hands on something
that might interest you.

93
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,978
What?

94
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,421
A Gatling gun.

95
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,389
What are you willing to take
for this big gun?

96
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,624
I'd trade you that there big gun
for a woman.

97
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,591
A what?

98
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,193
A woman.

99
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,469
What do you want with a woman?

100
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,497
What do you mean?

101
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,834
What do you mean
what do I want with a woman?

102
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,499
What should any man want
with a woman?

103
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,204
I'll pay you for the big gun.

104
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,684
Yeah, and I'll spend it all
in the first water hole I come to.

105
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,046
You know I can't leave the territory.

106
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,347
It's a woman or nothing.

107
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,285
Where am I gonna find a woman
out here?

108
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,756
Well, that's your problem.

109
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,218
Is it a deal?

110
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,201
Yeah, it's a deal.

111
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,346
What's that shining
in your horse's mouth?

112
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,988
- His teeth.
Shines like gold.

113
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,126
Cavities.

114
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,557
I love my horse.

115
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,099
Let's see.
There's the Standall sisters.

116
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:19,836
- What?
- No, I couldn't do that.

117
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,799
Hey, are the bones still here?

118
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,840
His name is John.

119
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,410
John.

120
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:11,091
It arrived here in Bad Water
two weeks ago, Senor Baker.

121
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:25,943
<i>Dear Mr. Baker,
you and my loving brother, Tommy,</i>

122
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:29,843
<i>must be having a fine time of it
out there in the West.</i>

123
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:33,382
<i>Out there where the most respectable
man within shouting distance</i>

124
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:36,350
<i>is a thief and a rogue
and a cutthroat.</i>

125
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,547
<i>But it's coming to the end, laddie.</i>

126
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:41,420
<i>And that's why I'm taking my pen
in hand to write you,</i>

127
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,391
<i>you miserable man.</i>

128
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:47,862
<i>By the time you receive
this wee message, I'll be on my way.</i>

129
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,362
<i>I'm coming for you, Mr. Baker.</i>

130
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,562
Oh, no.

131
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,866
<i>You can set your mind to it
and pack your kit.</i>

132
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,511
<i>You asked me to marry you
and you meant it.</i>

133
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,045
<i>And I said I would and I meant it.</i>

134
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:06,309
<i>So you can get
your great brute of a self ready</i>

135
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,818
<i>because I'm coming
by the first passage I can find.</i>

136
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,388
<i>Your loving Dover.</i>

137
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,252
Dover, right? Is she sick?

138
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,416
- She's coming.
- Coming here?

139
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,222
- To take me back to Pennsylvania.
- Oh, my God.

140
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,957
She's coming to take me back
whether I'm ready to go or not.

141
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,395
Well, you did ask my sister
to marry you.

142
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,298
And we've been out here
almost four years.

143
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,234
And two years
was your agreement with her.

144
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,306
You told her you could make
your fortune in that time

145
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,999
and go home as rich as Croesus.

146
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,542
I thought you were on my side.

147
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,780
You came out here
to do something big.

148
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:36,972
Am I right or am I wrong?

149
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,447
- You're right.
- Well, your time's more than run out.

150
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:42,815
And you haven't done it yet because
you keep putting it off and putting it off,

151
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,185
because you know that when you do it,
it'll be the end of this life for you.

152
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,758
You might as well face it, lad,
it's gonna be the end anyway

153
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,362
once my sister gets here,
and that's a fact.

154
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,361
Emilio Estevez was the biggest
bandit of them all, senor.

155
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,163
This whole town is his?

156
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,034
He was the enemy of Benito Juárez.

157
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,506
Also, he was the enemy
of Maximilian.

158
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,269
Also, he did not care for his mother.

159
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,440
When he took this town, he kept it.

160
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,377
Everything he steals,
he brings to this place.

161
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:13,081
It's the Sodom and Gomorrah
of Mexico.

162
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,449
Yeah. They'll remember me for this.

163
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,351
It's like the sack of Rome.

164
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,958
But we are only a dozen guns.

165
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,617
But with the big gun, we can do it.

166
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,993
Okay, the big gun. Ha, ha, ha.

167
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:28,794
Hey, look.

168
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,107
You suppose?
Aye.

169
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,213
Those three were doing
what we're thinking about.

170
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,810
It's not gonna be easy, Baker.

171
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,417
There are over a hundred guns
down there.

172
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,748
Well, the hell with their guns, Tommy.
This is it.

173
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,549
Something big.

174
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,816
Big.

175
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,803
Laddie!

176
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,550
Hiyah!

177
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,131
Yes?

178
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,971
Sir, I think you best come
to the saloon, sir.

179
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,373
Saloon, why?

180
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,413
Well, I think you best come and see,
sir.

181
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,441
Very well.

182
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:13,965
<i>I'm lonesome since I crossed the hill</i>

183
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,471
<i>And o'er the moor and valley</i>

184
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:21,636
<i>Such heavy thoughts my heart do fill
Since parting with my Sally</i>

185
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:27,078
<i>I seek no more the fine and gay
For each does but remind me</i>

186
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:32,713
<i>How swift the hours did pass away
With the girl I left behind me</i>

187
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:39,091
<i>Oh, ne'er shall I forget the night
The stars were bright above me</i>

188
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:44,429
<i>And gently lent their silvery light
When first she vowed she loved me</i>

189
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:49,905
<i>But now I'm bound to Brighton camp
Kind heaven, favor find me</i>

190
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:55,604
<i>And send me safely back again
To the girl I left behind me</i>

191
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,745
Sir, the men wanted me to tell you

192
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:05,185
what a pleasure it's been
to serve under you.

193
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:09,020
And, well, we know it's gonna be
two weeks before you're leaving,

194
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,027
but some of the men here
are gonna be out on patrol

195
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,188
when it comes your time to leave us,

196
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,665
and, well,
we'd like to take this opportunity...

197
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,540
Sir, it's my privilege and honor
to be the one chosen

198
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,374
to present you
with this token of our esteem.

199
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,982
I speak for all the horse soldiers
in your command when I say

200
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,244
that it's been an honor
to serve with you.

201
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,914
Under. Under.

202
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,090
- Under you, sir.
Ahem.

203
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,657
Yes.

204
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,458
Thank you, corporal.

205
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,588
Thank you.

206
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,869
Men, I find myself rather at a loss
for words.

207
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:07,485
It's most difficult for me to express
my feelings about this occasion

208
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,816
and all of you and the cavalry.

209
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,391
I believe only a soldier
could understand that,

210
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,357
possibly only a horse soldier.

211
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:22,565
I've been a cavalryman for 30 years.

212
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:27,366
And it's been my privilege
and my honor

213
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:31,168
to be acquainted
with a great many very brave men.

214
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:38,508
So I'm most grateful tonight
for this opportunity to tell you

215
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,852
that of all those with whom I served,

216
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:48,525
you men are the finest.

217
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,186
And I thank you.

218
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,737
Sir. Sir, you believe in
fair play, don't you?

219
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,032
And doing what's right?

220
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:03,731
Why, of course, sergeant.

221
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,140
Well, it was me that was supposed
to give you that Indian headdress

222
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,904
and not Corporal James here.

223
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:13,077
And, well, I'd like your permission to
express my feelings on this matter, sir.

224
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,549
Oh, I see.

225
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,483
Well, certainly.

226
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:22,158
Corporal James,
that was a bad thing you done to me.

227
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,561
But, sergeant...

228
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,162
I'm gonna take you one by one
what put him up to it too.

229
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,823
Try me, sarge!

230
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,764
- Excuse me, sir.
- Carry on, sergeant.

231
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,636
- Oh, your hat, sir.
- Thank you, corporal.

232
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:12,766
That was very unwise, you know.
Sergeant Fitzsimmons is sensitive.

233
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,675
- Sensitive, sir?
- Very sensitive.

234
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,197
Colonel?

235
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,125
Evening.
- Good evening, sir.

236
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,669
- Will you sit a spell?
- Don't mind if I do. Thank you.

237
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:44,002
- Have a cigar.
- I will. Thank you.

238
00:20:55,887 --> 00:21:00,256
Well, captain,
I'm going to miss this outfit very much.

239
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:05,120
And any day now, my wife
will be arriving through the gate,

240
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,922
and away I go.

241
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,930
Mrs. Morgan is coming here
to the fort?

242
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,969
Yeah. With bells on, captain.
Bells on.

243
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:17,632
I guess she wants to be sure
I retire this time.

244
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,142
I started to twice before,
but when I came right down to it,

245
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:24,043
why, I couldn't.

246
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,013
Listen to that.

247
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:31,388
<i>MEN I seek no more the fine
and gay for each does but remind me</i>

248
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,218
History we're making, captain.

249
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,588
We're making history.

250
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,458
Someday, it'll be a tired, old,
ghost town,

251
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:43,260
that's all, blowing in the wind.

252
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,938
Ahem. Well, good night, captain.

253
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,370
- Good night, sir.
- Thank you for the cigar.

254
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,134
You're welcome, colonel.

255
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,779
<i>Kind heaven, favor find me</i>

256
00:21:54,946 --> 00:22:00,407
<i>And send me safely back again
To the girl I left behind me</i>

257
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:15,524
How are you?

258
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,934
- What the...?
- That Mr. John Anderson.

259
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,074
Well, yeah, but, uh...

260
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:27,403
It was his last wish
on his deathbed.

261
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:31,242
Mr. Anderson said
if his friends cannot be with him,

262
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,646
he always want to be
with his friends.

263
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,411
Heh, heh.
That was a very fine gesture.

264
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:39,045
- What you like to drink?
- Oh, whiskey, I reckon.

265
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:45,520
You wouldn't be knowing a man
named Baker, I don't suppose?

266
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,028
He rides with a dog.

267
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,258
<i>Si, everybody knows Senor Baker.</i>

268
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:50,865
He been around lately?

269
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,828
Oh, seven, eight days ago.

270
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:57,566
Why do you ask?
Is Senor Baker a compadre to you?

271
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,211
No, not exactly.

272
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,813
I heard he was planning
something big.

273
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,972
Oh, yes.
He's planning something big.

274
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,448
<i>Mucho, mucho, mucho, very big.</i>

275
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,552
Yeah. What?

276
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,590
I don't know.

277
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,105
Aah!

278
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,210
Are you a bandit?

279
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,151
No, ma'am. Just an old cowboy
trying to get along.

280
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,492
Hell, honey, I don't care
what you call yourself,

281
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,958
but if you're after our valuables,

282
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,394
I'll tell you now, mine,
you can't put in a saddle bag.

283
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,660
You wanna bet?

284
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,063
Tommy?

285
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,554
Well?

286
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,487
- Why not?
- You'll bring shame on yourself

287
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,183
giving Johnny Cobb
a woman like her.

288
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,189
- Well, how do you figure?
- Look at it, lad.

289
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:01,522
You want people to think
she's the best you can do?

290
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,270
He just said he wanted a woman.

291
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,173
He didn't say he wanted one
with a bloodline.

292
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,109
Can you no understand, lad?

293
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,708
Taking her to Cobb would be
to go against the scripture.

294
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,376
Scripture?
What's the Bible got to do with it?

295
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:26,587
Christian thing to do is
to get the kind of a woman for Cobb

296
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,953
that you'd want Cobb to get for you.

297
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,526
You're right. Luis?

298
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:06,989
Two men.

299
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:11,124
More than likely that's Johnny Cobb
and the flea that rides with him.

300
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:12,531
More than likely.

301
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,968
And you don't have the woman for him
for trade.

302
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,632
It could mean trouble.

303
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,402
Well, let's let him hear
what trouble really sounds like.

304
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,911
Aye. What air do you fancy then?

305
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,309
"Campbells Are Coming."

306
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,341
Hey, welcome home.

307
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,179
Come on, Tuffy.

308
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,448
You were gone a lot longer this time
than I thought you'd be.

309
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:42,457
Oh, we were down in Mexico
looking over the town of Estevez.

310
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,997
They rode in this morning.

311
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,558
Baker, where's the woman?

312
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,527
Johnny's talking to you, Baker.

313
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,094
You start something with me, Moon,

314
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,236
and they'll be collecting you
in a gunny sack.

315
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:26,802
Where is the woman?

316
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:28,836
When I have her, I'll let you know,
all right?

317
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,133
When?

318
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,742
What do you think I am, Cobb,
a magician?

319
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:36,278
You think it's easy to produce
a woman out of nowhere?

320
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,439
Don't you think
if I could find a woman,

321
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:39,947
I'd have one or two for myself?

322
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:43,743
Yeah. Well, what about the time
they stole your cook's wooden leg

323
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:47,016
out of that cat house in Bad Water
and used it for firewood,

324
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:48,250
you found him another?

325
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:50,257
Where'd you find a wooden leg
way out here?

326
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,953
- Well, it wasn't easy.
- And that horse of yours.

327
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,565
You got the only horse in the world
with gold teeth.

328
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,259
What's your point?

329
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:00,268
His point is, if you can find them things
in this country,

330
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:01,905
you can find him a woman.

331
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:06,066
Yeah. And now you just listen to me
and you better listen good.

332
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:10,044
If it wasn't for the $5,000 price
on my head outside this territory,

333
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,080
I wouldn't even be talking to you.

334
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,749
We got a deal. You and me. A deal.

335
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,020
A woman for a Gatling gun.

336
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:20,055
Now, I can get my hands
on that Gatling gun this week.

337
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,249
Where's the woman?

338
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,291
What you need is a drink, Johnny.

339
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:24,951
What I need is a woman!

340
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,725
You could make a man deaf
yelling in his ear like that.

341
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:34,962
Sit down, Johnny.
Have a drink. Sit down.

342
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:43,503
When I lie down at nights,
I'm thinking about a woman.

343
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,847
And when I get up in the morning,

344
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,983
I'm thinking about a woman.

345
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,713
It's been years.

346
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:56,486
Baker, it's been years.

347
00:29:56,661 --> 00:30:00,859
I can't remember.
I can't even remember what's it like.

348
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,127
Johnny, I'll tell you what it's like.
First of all...

349
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,294
I don't want you to tell me,
I wanna do it!

350
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:10,037
Now, we got a deal.
Gatling gun for a woman.

351
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,436
Now, where is she?

352
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:14,806
It's a sorry kind of a man
who resorts to violence, Cobb.

353
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,078
Just take a drink.

354
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,927
He's been waiting for you.

355
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,828
Attention!

356
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,899
Couldn't you do that outside,
Bookbinder?

357
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,201
Sergeant Fitzsimmons
has just finished cleaning the o...

358
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:47,844
No, not now.

359
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,110
What'd you find out?

360
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:51,939
Well, I rode out to Bad Water

361
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,710
and talked to a Mexican there
that runs the cantina.

362
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,114
Yes?

363
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:58,312
Then I rode on down
to the stage stop

364
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:03,552
and talked to a mountain man there
named Nate Hattersby.

365
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:04,786
Go on.

366
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:07,932
Then I rode back a hundred miles
to Lost Boy Pass

367
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,624
and talked to a couple of Navajos there
riding south.

368
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,570
Bookbinder, could you just get to it?

369
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,229
What is Baker planning? Baker.

370
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:18,307
Something big.

371
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,447
Bookbinder,
I've been in the Army most of my life,

372
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,947
30 in the cavalry, to be exact,

373
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:28,984
and I have never ever had a scout

374
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,951
as utterly worthless as you are.
Get out.

375
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,717
Colonel,
if a man can't find something out,

376
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,418
he just can't find it out.
Now, that's all there is to it.

377
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:40,387
No, that is not all there is to it,
Bookbinder.

378
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,829
You are paid to know.
Do you understand?

379
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,966
Do...? No, you don't.
Get out. Get out.

380
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,409
Yah! Yah!

381
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,383
Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah!

382
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,505
We'll water the horses here.

383
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,411
Whoa!

384
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:38,471
Baker. All I hear is Baker.

385
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:42,549
He's held up four stagecoaches
in one week, gentlemen.

386
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,383
Here, here, here and here.

387
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:50,218
He hasn't harmed anyone and
he hasn't taken anything from them.

388
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,555
Now, what does that leave?

389
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:55,665
Obviously, he's looking for something
or someone or whatever.

390
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:58,927
Well, before he finds them or it
or whatever it is he's looking for,

391
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:02,869
I want to know who or what it is,
you understand?

392
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:07,077
Now, one thing for sure,
as I'm standing here,

393
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:10,339
we know he's out there right now
somewhere,

394
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:12,881
holding up another stagecoach.

395
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,011
Question, gentlemen:

396
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,882
Why is he doing it? Why?

397
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:35,503
Whoa!

398
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,638
Apache Flats.

399
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,198
You folks better come in.

400
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:09,100
This will be your last drink of water
before Dry Wells.

401
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,824
What's going on here?

402
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:37,324
Who are you? What do you want?

403
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,718
I'm going to see you shot.

404
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,863
And who's gonna do the shooting?

405
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,593
It may interest you to know
that my name is Mary Anna Morgan.

406
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:12,930
My husband is the commanding officer
of the fort at Dry Wells.

407
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,565
Is that the best you can think of
to scare me?

408
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:19,005
You cannot be the colonel's lady,
lassie.

409
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,402
And why not?

410
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,908
Every man in the territory knows
the colonel is married

411
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,945
to a cold lady who lives back East.

412
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:30,213
Aye. A cold, frigid, barren woman
with no heart or soul.

413
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,419
- You know the colonel?
- We've met along the way.

414
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:36,424
And I suppose he told you all this
about his wife?

415
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:37,754
He didn't have to.

416
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:41,296
What other kind of a woman would
make a man live alone to do his duty?

417
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,931
How's your health?
Does your belly ever hurt you?

418
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:47,969
- I beg your pardon.
- Or your head? Or anything?

419
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,569
I'll tell you one thing.

420
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,038
You sure do look like
everything is in order.

421
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:57,004
- Can I see you a minute, Tommy?
- Aye.

422
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:31,641
Whoa!

423
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,110
What do you mean
the colonel's wife ain't here?

424
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,755
There was nothing you could do,
huh?

425
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,016
- Not a thing, Jesse. They took us by...
Pardon me.

426
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:43,092
What's going on here?
Where's my wife?

427
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,922
You, stop. Where's Mrs. Morgan?

428
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:49,089
Sir, I've got your wife's luggage
and that's all.

429
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,962
Colonel,
I just don't know how to tell you.

430
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:52,830
Well, find a way, man,
find a way, quickly.

431
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:56,206
Well, sir, your wife was tooken
at Apache Flats.

432
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,604
There was about a dozen of them,
mostly Mexican.

433
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,437
But the leader, he was no Mex.

434
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,741
- Did he have dark hair?
- And a dog.

435
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,381
- Brown eyes?
- Yep, and a dog.

436
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:07,483
- Tall and lean?
- That's right. And he had a dog.

437
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,745
Yes, and a dog.

438
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,982
Baker.

439
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,885
Baker.

440
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,023
Something big.

441
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,129
Bring this man to my office, sergeant.

442
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,493
Yes, sir.

443
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,594
I'll make a deal with you.

444
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:00,896
You can hate me,
but you can still drink my water.

445
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,437
On that basis, I'll do it.

446
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,331
I don't have a disease.

447
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:09,240
Neither do I,
and it's gonna remain that way.

448
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,040
Will you answer one question
for me?

449
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,512
I got no secrets.

450
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:20,185
Why am I here?
What do you intend to do with me?

451
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:23,624
- Do you want it straight out?
- Yes.

452
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:27,721
I'm trading you to a man
for a Gatling gun.

453
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:33,832
I know it ain't right, but no one's ever
accused me of being good.

454
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,028
I got a qualm.

455
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,538
I don't want you to think
that I'm bragging,

456
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,437
but I've known a lot of women
in my time.

457
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:43,242
But I don't remember seeing one
as beautiful as you.

458
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:47,575
And it's sure gonna hurt me
to turn you over to him.

459
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,753
Don't you have any idea
which way they went?

460
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:00,658
Nope, I sure ain't, colonel.

461
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:03,299
I ain't even got a notion
which way they come.

462
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:06,630
- They was just there.
- Just there.

463
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:11,441
Are you absolutely certain
you didn't hear him say anything?

464
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:13,907
I didn't say
I didn't hear him say anything.

465
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,104
I said I didn't hear him say anything
about where he was going.

466
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:19,841
Then you did hear him
say something?

467
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,778
- Sure did.
- Well?

468
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,483
Would you mind telling me
what he said,

469
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,954
if it's not too much strain?

470
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,922
- He said...
- What? What'd he say?!

471
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:34,260
He asked Mrs. Morgan
how her belly was.

472
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:37,465
What?

473
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,302
Then he give her a probe or two.

474
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:46,835
Seemed real pleased.

475
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:48,876
Who seemed real pleased?

476
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,279
- Baker.
- Tyler!

477
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,577
We're taking your troop.
Issue three days' rations.

478
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,344
We'll pick up their trail
at Apache Flats.

479
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,387
- Bookbinder! Bookbinder!
Yes, sir.

480
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,664
They rode out of here
heading east, colonel.

481
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,970
Figure they're headed
for the Guadalupes.

482
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:53,905
We'll stay here the night,
push out in the morning.

483
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,477
Yes, sir.

484
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,312
- See the horses to the corral, captain.
- Yes, sir.

485
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:02,475
At a walk. Forward. Ho!

486
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,130
Colonel?

487
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:18,864
I reckon I've heard about everything
there is to hear about Baker.

488
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,871
Oh, I know you're worried
about your lady,

489
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,941
but I ain't never yet heard tell
of Baker hurting a woman.

490
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:31,711
Bookbinder, there are things a man
can do to a woman without hurting her.

491
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,908
Vile, rude, disgraceful,
undignified things.

492
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,947
Unspeakable things, Bookbinder.

493
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:39,612
Yeah.

494
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:54,928
Luis.

495
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:04,011
Senor Baker, four wagon loads
of whiskey going to Lordsburg.

496
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:05,976
Good.

497
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,906
You stay there, mister,
and I'll get you a drink.

498
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:31,326
This is all well and good,
but it's not the big thing, is it?

499
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,265
The Indians are gonna like
this whiskey.

500
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:36,702
Aye, they're men, are they not?
What kind of answer is that then?

501
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:39,399
We're gonna need them
for our big thing.

502
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,242
Okay. Heh, heh.

503
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:32,088
They love me.

504
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:42,134
Baker.

505
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,005
Jesus saves. Amen.

506
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,643
Whiskey, good.

507
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:50,609
You bring sunshine.

508
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:53,346
So good. Welcome.

509
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,007
I figured you'd like it.

510
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:58,445
You good man, Baker.

511
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,348
You lovely man.

512
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:02,583
Well, chief, thank you.

513
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,787
But, well, there's just one little thing.

514
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:10,092
Lovely. Lovely. Lovely.

515
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:41,054
Hey, Pickens,
I brung you a guest for supper.

516
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:43,131
Yeah, I saw.

517
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,825
And I'm glad to see
you finally found...

518
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:00,682
Oh, I can't... I can't believe this.

519
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:05,378
What's so funny
about my taste in women?

520
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,886
Is she the one? Ha, ha, ha.

521
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:09,355
Well, what's wrong with her?

522
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:12,086
Is she the one you got
for Johnny Cobb?

523
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:14,059
- Yeah, what's wrong with her?
- Ha, ha, ha.

524
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,927
Joe, don't you know who she is?

525
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:21,259
- Well, she told us some story about...
- Ha, ha, ha.

526
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:23,167
You mean?

527
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,467
You don't mean?

528
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,114
I don't suppose
you'd like to talk about it.

529
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:35,712
Just before they stand you
in front of my husband's firing squad,

530
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:38,514
I'd be happy to discuss it with you,
Mr. Baker.

531
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:43,793
Now, will you please show me
to my quarters?

532
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,163
Show you to your quart...?
You sleep here.

533
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:49,265
Indeed. And where will you sleep?

534
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,162
Beneath you.

535
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,266
I prefer to sleep somewhere else,
thank you.

536
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:55,905
"I prefer to sleep somewhere else."

537
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,665
You'll sleep here,
I'll sleep beneath you

538
00:47:57,841 --> 00:48:01,436
and that's the way it's gonna be
until Cobb comes to collect you.

539
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:24,659
Tommy, how does a good man like me
get into a mess like this?

540
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:51,627
I'm sorry, Mrs. Morgan,
but we don't stock lilac water.

541
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:54,830
You can't seriously expect

542
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:58,627
that I'm gonna bathe in that tub
in this room?

543
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:00,770
Well, except for the fort
at Dry Wells,

544
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,168
that's the only tub I know of
for a hundred miles.

545
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:06,203
That isn't exactly what I meant,
Mr. Baker.

546
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:08,503
I seriously doubt
whether you've ever known one,

547
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,647
but I happen to be a lady.

548
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:12,675
Is that a fact?

549
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:15,108
That is most certainly a fact.

550
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,917
Does that mean that
you're put together somehow different

551
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:21,182
than any other woman?

552
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:25,617
What I'm getting at is,
if I didn't know any other females,

553
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,959
then I wouldn't know
what I was looking at, would I?

554
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,690
Would I?

555
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:33,393
But it just so happens
I know other females

556
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,663
and I know exactly
what I'm looking at.

557
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,534
So it don't make no difference,
does it?

558
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,638
Out here,
we all bathe in the same water.

559
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,008
I usually go first,
but I'm giving you that honor,

560
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:48,015
you being such a fine lady and all.

561
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,580
Now, here's the way it works.

562
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:52,950
Tommy scrubs my back,
I scrub Tommy's back.

563
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:56,149
Pickens scrubs Luis' back
and Luis scrubs Pickens' back.

564
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:59,921
That's the way it was until you come in
and messed up the whole organization.

565
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:02,930
Now, we'll just have
to rearrange it all.

566
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:05,498
And while you're here,

567
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,502
Luis will scrub your back
and you'll scrub...

568
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:20,212
She's still in it.

569
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:21,646
Where'd you meet her?

570
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:24,218
I was in her husband's company
during the war.

571
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,788
We rode together at Manassas.

572
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:30,449
I guess I'd still be a horse soldier
if I hadn't lost my leg.

573
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:33,528
- In the war?
- No.

574
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:37,895
See, there was this girl in Virginia
and her father caught us.

575
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:39,501
Cut it off.

576
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:41,933
Chopped it clean off with an ax

577
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:44,899
- while I was sleeping.
- Really?

578
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:47,639
Cross my heart.

579
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,679
You're lucky it was only your leg.

580
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,061
I know what you're thinking.

581
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,197
You're thinking
that somewhere out there,

582
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:17,465
your husband's looking for you.

583
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:19,574
It's logical, isn't it?

584
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,608
Very logical.

585
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:24,845
Why'd you make him live
all those years alone?

586
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:26,539
I can't think of any reason
in the world

587
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:29,412
why I should answer a question
like that from you.

588
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,282
You don't have to talk to me at all.

589
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:35,016
But what have you got to lose?

590
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,326
That's one way of looking at it,
I suppose.

591
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:41,221
You don't seem as upset
as I thought you'd be.

592
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:44,959
If I don't,
it's because I don't believe it.

593
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:49,101
Things like this don't happen.
Not to me.

594
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:52,335
Nothing ever happened to me
back in Pennsylvania either.

595
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:54,500
That's why I came out here.

596
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:59,047
All my life, I've wanted to do
something big, really big.

597
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:02,351
Now I can do it,
but I need that Gatling gun.

598
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:03,986
And that's where I fit in.

599
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:07,282
This is my first chance
to do the big thing.

600
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,721
May be my last chance.

601
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:12,054
You wouldn't understand.

602
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,758
I understood
that my husband had to be cavalry,

603
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:17,593
had to be a horse soldier.

604
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:21,703
I never sympathized,
but I understood.

605
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,873
I don't believe you.

606
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:28,169
I don't believe you're gonna trade me
for a Gatling gun.

607
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:29,537
Why don't you believe me?

608
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,673
Because I'm worth more than that.
Far more.

609
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:36,614
And you know it.

610
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,550
Looks like they've been here, colonel.

611
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:25,958
Colonel, dog soldiers sending word
we're coming.

612
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,466
Hm.

613
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:33,966
Tyler.

614
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:38,747
- Sir.
- I'm going on alone, captain.

615
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:42,112
- You take the men back to Dry Wells.
- Well, sir, the men understand.

616
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:45,448
- They're more than willing to continue.
- Yes, I'm certain they are.

617
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:49,718
This is a very personal matter.
I can't endanger their lives.

618
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,884
Begging the colonel's pardon,
but don't you consi...

619
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,927
No, no, this is not an Indian matter,
captain.

620
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:56,190
Just take the men back to the fort.

621
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:57,833
Yes, sir.

622
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:00,959
Thank you.

623
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:05,470
I'm sending the men home,
Bookbinder.

624
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:08,577
If you'd like to go with them,
that's all right with me, I understand.

625
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,373
Well, things is getting a little dull
back at the fort, colonel.

626
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:13,573
I believe I'll just stay with you.

627
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,479
I appreciate that.

628
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,927
Troop, dismount.

629
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,970
Water your horses.

630
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:28,420
Baker, you just get
purtier and purtier.

631
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:29,990
I sure am a lucky man.

632
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,391
Every time I come back here,
I half expect to see you two gone.

633
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:37,095
Every time we think of leaving,
Polly finds another nugget.

634
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:38,359
That's right.

635
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:41,698
We ain't got nothing but a cow
and a hole in the ground.

636
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:44,863
You might say we live
from nipple to nugget.

637
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:49,740
Come on down.
I got an itch that needs scratching.

638
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:55,214
Come here, Tuffy.

639
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:01,387
Hey, why don't you plant
some flowers or something

640
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:03,025
on your husband's grave?

641
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:07,254
He didn't smell nice living,
why should he smell nice dead?

642
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:09,955
I'm speaking about respect.

643
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,591
That's right, Baker.

644
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:16,364
And we got a lot of respect for you.

645
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:23,275
I sure am hungry.
You got anything cooking?

646
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:33,453
Whoa, whoa. Whoa!

647
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:37,021
Whoa.

648
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:05,482
Why do you suppose the Army always
picks uninhabitable places to settle?

649
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:07,953
I don't know, ma'am, but it's a fact.

650
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:09,785
Oh, maybe I should tell you,

651
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:13,952
it's customary for all ladies to check
into the fort at the company office.

652
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,290
First building over there.

653
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:18,226
I'll send your baggage over.

654
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:52,395
I'm looking for Baker.

655
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:56,470
Everybody's looking for him, ma'am.

656
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,704
And why do you suppose
they're doing that?

657
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,682
Well, ma'am, I could give you
a thousand reasons,

658
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:10,649
but, particularly,
because he's got the colonel's wife.

659
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,712
Does he?

660
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:16,256
Well, I never knew Baker
when he didn't have some man's wife.

661
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:20,753
Aye, he follows the skirts
like a dog follows the scent of a fox.

662
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:23,059
How is it you know him so well,
ma'am?

663
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,391
He's going to marry with me.

664
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:31,239
I am Miss Dover MacBride
and I've come to get him.

665
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:44,078
Hey, laddie, tell me this,
what are we gonna do with her?

666
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:48,319
I don't know, but she's right.

667
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:52,052
She's worth a hell of a lot more
than that goddamn gun.

668
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:55,820
You know something?
Cobb's cheating me.

669
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:59,592
Aye. If only she wasn't
the cavalry colonel's wife, eh?

670
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:03,296
No, that's not it. It's her. It's all her.
She makes me wonder.

671
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:06,909
- About what?
- Well, now, what do you think?

672
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:08,801
You're gonna have to make
a decision.

673
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:10,809
Cobb's gonna be along any day
with the big gun.

674
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,004
I know.

675
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:13,648
What you gonna tell him
when he comes?

676
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:15,477
I don't know.

677
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:17,313
If she's still here,
he's gonna see her.

678
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:19,011
I know.

679
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:22,749
Look, I got the colonel's wife,

680
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:25,094
Dover's coming to get me,

681
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:27,695
Cobb's coming with the big gun.

682
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:31,391
It's getting hard to keep things straight
in my mind.

683
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:36,295
Have you considered
taking her back then?

684
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,205
You know, I'm getting a terrible pain
in my head, Tommy.

685
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:42,276
Would you mind just shutting up?

686
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:46,575
If you take her back,
you'll have nothing for Cobb.

687
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,809
If you give her to Cobb, we'll have
the whole U.S. Cavalry against us.

688
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:51,920
Now, personally, I prefer Cobb.

689
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,851
I'm just trying to be helpful,
you understand?

690
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:57,220
Well, you're not being helpful, Tommy.
You're making me sick.

691
00:59:57,393 --> 00:59:58,724
Aye.

692
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:54,149
Count it.

693
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:57,849
Not enough.

694
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,420
Well, now, why don't
you try counting it, Malachi?

695
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:09,391
I know how much it is.
It's not enough.

696
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:10,589
You know how much it is,

697
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:13,167
then you know
it's what we agreed on in Tucumcari.

698
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:17,868
This ain't Tucumcari.

699
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:22,173
Say what you gotta say.
I'm in a hurry.

700
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:27,814
Words in Tucumcari
ain't money in El Paso.

701
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:30,849
Cost me more than I thought
for the big gun.

702
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:34,351
I've come too far and risked too much
to take a loss.

703
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:35,752
How much more?

704
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:38,353
Uh...

705
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:40,127
Half again as much.

706
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:43,189
You must think
my mama raised a fool.

707
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:46,457
Half again as much, Cobb.

708
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:50,299
Take it or leave it.

709
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:56,736
He ate like a pig.

710
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,914
Hello, amigo.

711
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:11,987
- Tequila or whiskey?
- Whiskey.

712
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:14,425
- What do you have to eat, sir?
- Well, I got goat.

713
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:16,622
- Billy or nanny?
- Never mind.

714
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:19,791
- Do you have anything else?
- Horse.

715
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:23,732
Oh, we'll have some of the...
Some of the goat and whiskey.

716
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:26,306
- Thank you.
- Me too.

717
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:34,172
There we are.

718
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,744
Mr. Bookbinder here tells me

719
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:41,651
you're acquainted with a man
by the name of Baker. Is that right?

720
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:46,354
Senor Baker is a good friend of mine.
Very close.

721
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:48,861
Very good.
You see, Bookbinder, what'd I tell you?

722
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:51,061
You have to know
how to handle these people.

723
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:53,498
Treat them nicely, decently,
speak to them quietly,

724
01:02:53,669 --> 01:02:55,933
and there's no end
to what you can find out. Ahem.

725
01:02:56,105 --> 01:03:00,974
Now, then, has he been around
to see you lately, Baker?

726
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:03,676
I don't remember
when was the last time.

727
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:06,706
Yeah. Where does he live?

728
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:12,988
How many hombres ride with him?

729
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:15,215
I don't know.

730
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,388
I thought he was a good friend
of yours.

731
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:22,556
Very good friend.
- I see.

732
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:26,190
Well, thank you very much.
You've been most helpful.

733
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:32,907
Plum full of information, ain't he?

734
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:47,517
What a sight.

735
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:50,158
I missed my calling.
I should have been a general.

736
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:52,851
Have you made any decision
regarding the colonel's lady?

737
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:55,862
- You gonna start that again?
- You haven't got much time, Baker.

738
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:03,998
- You got me into this.
- I got you into it?

739
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:06,903
You're the one that said I should give
Johnny Cobb the kind of a woman

740
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:09,010
- I'd expect him to give to me.
- Okay.

741
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,104
I didn't promise him
any kind of a woman.

742
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,147
I never spoke to Cobb, you did,
and you best not be forgetting it either.

743
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:20,750
Why do you suppose a man's
supposed to love only one woman?

744
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:22,322
It's the Lord's ruling.

745
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:24,356
You know something, Tommy?

746
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:28,520
If she wasn't the colonel's lady
and if it wasn't for Dover,

747
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:31,667
and if she was willing,
which she naturally would be,

748
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:34,462
I mean, me being me and all,

749
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:36,400
I'd keep her for myself.

750
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:38,463
And what about the big gun?

751
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:40,199
We'll take that away from Cobb.

752
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:43,311
He's nothing but a thief and a robber.
He'll understand.

753
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:02,796
Carrie! Carrie!

754
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,030
Two men coming.

755
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:30,817
Good evening, ma'am,
I'm, ahem, Colonel Morgan,

756
01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:32,790
- commanding officer of the...
- Come on in.

757
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:34,361
You don't wanna wait out here.

758
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,930
Yes, ma'am.
I mean, no, ma'am, thank you.

759
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:40,591
- You can come in too, mister.
- Why, thank you, ma'am.

760
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:44,430
Good evening.

761
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:47,806
I'm Polly Standall.

762
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:50,810
- This here is my sister Carrie.
- How do you do?

763
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,777
Ladies, we're looking for a man
named Baker.

764
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,281
Would either of you
happen to know him?

765
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,111
Know him?

766
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:03,690
He come through here last year
like a dose of salts.

767
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:05,827
He didn't even take his boots off.

768
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:10,287
Yes. Do you know
where we could find him?

769
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:13,562
Wherever he is, it's soft and warm.

770
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:20,507
Why don't you sit down,
make yourselves to home.

771
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:22,936
Oh, no, thank you very much.

772
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:27,071
We'd be most appreciative if you'd
allow us to sleep in your shed tonight.

773
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:29,641
What's in the shed?

774
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,218
I beg your pardon?

775
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:34,653
There ain't nothing in the shed
for you.

776
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:40,060
You come right over here.

777
01:06:40,963 --> 01:06:42,726
- Sit down.
- Oh.

778
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:45,731
Oh, thank you. Ahem.

779
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:47,835
Thank you very much.

780
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:00,549
I just love soldiers.

781
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:02,206
Why, thank you.

782
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:05,679
Sailors too.

783
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,347
But I lean more to soldiers.

784
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,925
Well, that's very kind of you, ma'am.

785
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:14,585
It's always...
It's always good to be appreciated.

786
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:16,061
You know, I, uh... Ahem.

787
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:23,769
I always felt that if more civilians
felt the way you do...

788
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:25,938
I mean,
if more civilians felt the way you...

789
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:28,804
You don't really wanna spend
the night in that old shed, do you?

790
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:32,305
It's so cold and dirty out there.

791
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:36,341
Well, I've become accustomed
to sleeping in the dirt

792
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:40,319
and the cold and the heat
in the bulk of my military career.

793
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:42,081
Where do you think you're going?

794
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:44,986
I'm just gonna go out
and get a little fresh air.

795
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:47,152
No, you're staying right here,
Bookbinder.

796
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:51,424
- But, look, colonel, l...
Sit down, Bookbinder.

797
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,795
Sit down. That's an order.

798
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:57,263
Now, we're staying in this room
together.

799
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,203
And when we leave,
we are leaving together.

800
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:00,740
Is that understood?

801
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:03,568
As a matter of fact,
we're leaving now.

802
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:07,113
It's obligatory
that we get an early start, l...

803
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,312
Now, see here.

804
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:11,045
Look, you two,

805
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,313
I appreciate the food
and the hospitality very much,

806
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:16,287
but there's a limit
to what you can expect of a guest.

807
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:17,824
You ain't no guest, honey.

808
01:08:17,993 --> 01:08:19,517
- You're supper.
- What?

809
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:22,129
You take a turn, Polly,
and then you can hold the gun for me.

810
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:23,864
Ooh! Heh.

811
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:29,031
I just love soldiers. Heh.

812
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:02,028
Dismiss the troop, corporal.

813
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:05,401
Company dismissed.

814
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,547
Sir, am I glad to see you, sir.

815
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:16,776
- What's the problem, Fitzsimmons?
- Well, sir, it's a woman.

816
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:18,510
A what?

817
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:21,155
And if you don't mind my saying so,
sir, she's quite beautiful.

818
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:24,258
- Well, what's she doing here?
- She's looking for Baker, sir.

819
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:25,654
Looking for Baker?

820
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:26,988
Where is she?

821
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,529
Well, sir, I had to billet her
in the colonel's quarters.

822
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:31,689
You did what?

823
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:35,030
Well, sir, I couldn't very well put her
in the enlisted men's barracks, could I?

824
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:55,784
Oh.

825
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:58,453
Good evening, ma'am.
I'm Captain Tyler.

826
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:01,425
Colonel Morgan's adjutant.
Sergeant Fitzsimmons said that...

827
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:04,259
Tell me what Sergeant Fitzsimmons
said I said

828
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:06,867
and then I'll tell you what I said.

829
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,765
Yes, ma'am.
Well, Sergeant Fitzsimmons said...

830
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:11,202
I'm surprised that your Army
has an Irishman

831
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:12,772
in such a position of authority.

832
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:16,040
For you can never rely
on one of them for the truth.

833
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:17,941
- He said you...
- It's drinking they do best

834
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:21,640
and fighting and blaspheming
and telling outrageous stories,

835
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:23,546
the likes of which
you've never heard of

836
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,653
- in your born days.
- He said...

837
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:29,382
Aye, the Irishman
with tears in his eyes will tell you

838
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:32,322
that every word passing his lips
is the truth.

839
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:35,427
Yes, ma'am.
Well, he said that you, uh...

840
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:40,464
- That you came to get...
- To get Baker? Aye, I have that.

841
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:42,166
Well, what are your plans, ma'am?

842
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:44,602
I mean, how do you propose
to find him?

843
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:49,743
I'm here.

844
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:51,776
He'll know.

845
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:00,708
They're having a good time.

846
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:03,075
Yes, I know.

847
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:05,152
I've seen that kind of
good time before.

848
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:07,983
Many times, in the cavalry.

849
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:09,454
Always before they go out,

850
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:12,617
when there's a possibility
they may not come back.

851
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:15,386
The Indians do it too, I hear.

852
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:21,394
I'm not giving you to Johnny Cobb.

853
01:12:21,804 --> 01:12:23,499
Why aren't you?

854
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:26,505
- Straight out?
- Straight out.

855
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:31,936
Well, you were right.
You are worth more than the gun.

856
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:34,914
Isn't there another reason?

857
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:38,419
If there was,
why should it interest you?

858
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:42,115
A woman is always interested
in a man's reasons

859
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:43,690
for changing his mind about her.

860
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:55,233
You asked me why I've made my
husband live alone all these years.

861
01:12:55,604 --> 01:13:00,906
Well, we've had a month together
out of every one of those years.

862
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:04,204
And in each of those months,
we lived a year.

863
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:09,845
Each time he took his leave,
it was always new.

864
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:13,816
Each time we've been together,
it's been new.

865
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:20,159
It was falling in love all over again,
year after year.

866
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:25,097
I was always ready for him
and always wanted him.

867
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:28,829
Do you think I would've meant
the same thing to him

868
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:31,939
if I'd lived all those years with him
in the desert,

869
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:34,234
in the heat and the dirt?

870
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:40,539
"A cold, barren woman,"
your friend said of me.

871
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:42,915
No.

872
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:48,690
Because you see,
my bed is a rose garden.

873
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:57,025
I can tell you now the real reason
I'm not giving you to Johnny Cobb.

874
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:01,701
If I can't have you, why should he?

875
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:48,046
Bookbinder.

876
01:14:53,355 --> 01:14:57,382
Breathe a word of this to a living soul
and you're a dead man.

877
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:16,208
- Wake up. Come on, Joe, wake up.
- Hm?

878
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:19,677
- Your future wife is here.
- Oh.

879
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:23,045
- Where?
- The fort at Dry Wells.

880
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:25,851
How do you know?

881
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,024
It's true?

882
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:44,137
White squaw come far land.
Stage bring.

883
01:15:44,806 --> 01:15:48,742
- What makes him think it's Dover?
- He heard her talking to a sergeant.

884
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:50,606
Blue coat.

885
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:55,372
White woman. Dover, Dover.

886
01:15:55,551 --> 01:16:00,045
- Dover. It's true then. All right.
- Hm.

887
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:08,656
Baker, good friend.

888
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:18,102
You better go get her.
I'll meet you at Potter's Mesa.

889
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:47,527
Mr. Cobb, we haven't had the pleasure
of seeing you around the fort lately.

890
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:49,830
Been off on an ocean voyage,
have you?

891
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:52,633
Ain't none of the Army's business
where I've been.

892
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:54,639
I ain't wanted in this here territory.

893
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:58,174
No, you're not wanted for anything
in this territory yet, Mr. Cobb,

894
01:16:58,347 --> 01:17:02,010
but we always have high hopes of
doing business with you in the future.

895
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:03,446
You too, Mr. Moon.

896
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:07,177
Now, do you mind if I ask
what you're hauling there?

897
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:08,687
None of your business.

898
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:12,290
Not true, Mr. Cobb.

899
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:18,761
Why, that could be rifles
for the Apaches, or whiskey.

900
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:23,330
Any manner of things.

901
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:25,800
Whose horses are these?

902
01:17:26,341 --> 01:17:30,835
The one there is Mr. Moon's.
The other's mine. I bought him.

903
01:17:31,013 --> 01:17:33,641
Who from?
- What difference does it make?

904
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:36,247
I asked, Mr. Cobb.
That's the difference.

905
01:17:37,285 --> 01:17:40,152
I bought him from a man
named Malachi Morton.

906
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:41,748
Hm.

907
01:17:42,124 --> 01:17:45,821
Mr. Morton sold you the saddle
and the saddle bags and all, did he?

908
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:48,354
Yeah. That's right.

909
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,424
Well,

910
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:56,201
sold you his razor too.

911
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:06,607
Looks like Mr. Morton went out
of business permanently, didn't he?

912
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:08,476
Now, then...

913
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:10,277
Uh-uh.

914
01:18:10,452 --> 01:18:12,386
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

915
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:18,249
I just knew, deep in my heart,

916
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:20,361
we'd be doing business together
one of these days.

917
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:24,459
I didn't steal that there big gun.
I bought it from Mr. Morton.

918
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:29,299
Now, a Gatling gun disappeared
from the federal arsenal in El Paso

919
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:32,269
four weeks ago. I figure that one is it.
What do you figure?

920
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:34,265
I didn't take it.

921
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:38,641
That's not the point, Mr. Cobb.
The point is that you've got it.

922
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:43,814
And I figure you and Mr. Moon here
for ten to 20 years in federal prison.

923
01:18:44,586 --> 01:18:45,814
Hm?

924
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:50,219
Of course, I could just take the gun
from you and look the other way

925
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:53,122
while you two ride off
into the sunset.

926
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,052
What are you getting at?

927
01:18:56,431 --> 01:18:58,592
I'm trying to find a man
named Baker.

928
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:03,970
I figure if there's anybody
in the territory can help me, it's you.

929
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:05,163
Why should I?

930
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:07,638
Ten to 20, Mr. Cobb.

931
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:19,445
Miss Dover MacBride?

932
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:20,845
Aye.

933
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,623
Baker sent me.

934
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:41,007
Whoa, mule. Whoa.

935
01:19:56,558 --> 01:19:58,219
My sweet and loving brother,
Tommy,

936
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:01,558
who's looking after my interests
in the West.

937
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:04,961
Oh, you're a truly dependable sort,
Tommy.

938
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:07,667
And how's your health, Baker?

939
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:10,164
Glad to see you, Dover.

940
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:12,229
Are you now?

941
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:19,743
Years ago, when I was
but a wee lassie in Scotland,

942
01:20:19,915 --> 01:20:22,748
the Americans came to town
with a traveling circus.

943
01:20:23,585 --> 01:20:26,850
They called it
the Great Big Western Show.

944
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:30,216
It was all make-believe.

945
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:38,465
Just like you, Baker,

946
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:41,500
with your gun on your hip
and the devil in your heart.

947
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:43,597
Well, you're not being fair to me,
Dover.

948
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:45,330
I don't have the devil in my heart.

949
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:47,536
Do you have me in your heart, then?

950
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:50,872
You're the only woman
I ever think about.

951
01:20:51,246 --> 01:20:53,612
Oh, if I believed that,
the United States government

952
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:56,546
should ship me back to Scotland
as an undesirable

953
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:58,709
due to mental incompetence.

954
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:01,746
Do you really believe
I could ever look at another woman?

955
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,890
I wasn't thinking about your looking,
Baker.

956
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:08,188
I was thinking about your touching
and your kissing and your hugging.

957
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:12,089
Men get fairer hearings at a crooked
poker game than they get from you.

958
01:21:17,172 --> 01:21:19,402
I've missed you, Baker.

959
01:21:19,674 --> 01:21:22,142
I've missed you because I love you.

960
01:21:22,477 --> 01:21:24,308
Are you gonna marry with me
or are you not?

961
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:25,741
Of course, I am, Dover.

962
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:28,212
But my men,
they look to me and depend on me.

963
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:33,582
Aye. I have no doubt they look to you,
Baker, and depend on you too.

964
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:37,217
They look to you as the embodiment
of their own heathen ways

965
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:40,156
and depend on you
for the hair of the dog that bit them.

966
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,724
Nay, pack up, Baker.

967
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:47,391
For if you intend to marry with me,
it's back to the land that spawned you.

968
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:51,266
I couldn't say no to you doing
something big in your life,

969
01:21:51,706 --> 01:21:56,837
but I have a life too,
and you best be remembering it.

970
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:08,055
You're not make-believe, lad.

971
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:11,556
You're not
the Great Big Western Show.

972
01:22:20,168 --> 01:22:22,329
And with another brother like you,
Tommy,

973
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:24,369
I'd be out of the business
as a woman.

974
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:26,029
Aye.

975
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:29,908
One more week or else.

976
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:40,351
Or else what?

977
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:43,955
If you do not make arrangements
to join me in a week,

978
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:45,956
I'll be returning to Pittsburgh

979
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:48,561
and making my bed
with Angus MacNamara.

980
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:52,493
- Angus MacNamara?
- Aye.

981
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:55,568
You wouldn't do that to me...
You wouldn't shame me like that.

982
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:58,697
You've been away a long time,
Baker.

983
01:22:58,873 --> 01:23:02,172
I'm a woman with a woman's feelings
and a woman's desires.

984
01:23:03,178 --> 01:23:05,339
One more week and no more,

985
01:23:05,513 --> 01:23:07,640
or it's back to Angus MacNamara,

986
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:11,308
that wee, small, gnat of a man
from Pittsburgh.

987
01:23:14,055 --> 01:23:15,352
Come on.

988
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:18,491
Giddyap. Ha!

989
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:34,173
What a cruel woman she is.

990
01:23:39,047 --> 01:23:41,709
What is it you want with Baker?

991
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:45,544
He's got something
that belongs to me.

992
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:49,179
And you want it back, huh?

993
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:51,848
Yes, I want it back.

994
01:23:52,427 --> 01:23:54,725
Well, it must be valuable.

995
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:56,420
It is.

996
01:23:57,098 --> 01:24:00,590
- Did he steal it?
- That's right.

997
01:24:03,938 --> 01:24:07,271
There it is.
There's where you're gonna find him.

998
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:08,807
Mm-hm.

999
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:14,671
All right, Cobb, a deal's a deal.
You and Moon can go now.

1000
01:24:14,849 --> 01:24:18,842
Well, now, if it's all the same to you,
we'll just tag along.

1001
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:22,353
No, I don't need you anymore, Cobb.
I don't want you.

1002
01:24:22,524 --> 01:24:27,427
Baker's got something for me, Morgan.
Soon as I get it, I'll leave.

1003
01:24:29,931 --> 01:24:32,957
You were heading for there
all the time, weren't you?

1004
01:24:33,301 --> 01:24:35,166
Bringing him the gun?

1005
01:24:35,703 --> 01:24:38,263
Now, what does he want
with a Gatling gun?

1006
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:42,240
I never asked him.
None of my business.

1007
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:47,678
Of course, if I was to make a guess,
I'd say he were planning...

1008
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:49,976
- Something big.
- Heh, heh, heh.

1009
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:53,143
Yeah. Something mighty big.

1010
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,778
Senor MacBride.

1011
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:27,454
Look.

1012
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:38,425
- Baker, the big gun, it's coming and...
Luis, the big gun is here.

1013
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:41,398
Now, you give Cobb and Moon every
chance to leave, and no bloodshed.

1014
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:44,367
And get somebody
to get our Indian friends.

1015
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,203
Goddamn it,
give me time to finish, laddie.

1016
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:49,070
Colonel Morgan and Jesse is
with them.

1017
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:50,302
- What?
- Aye.

1018
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:52,969
It's all happening at once.
What do we do now?

1019
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:54,581
Mr. Baker.

1020
01:25:54,749 --> 01:25:55,977
Mr. Baker, any minute now,

1021
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:58,551
my husband is gonna come riding
over that hill.

1022
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:02,713
All my female instincts want
to rush into his arms, but I won't.

1023
01:26:03,057 --> 01:26:05,287
Not only because of the horrible mess
you're in,

1024
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:08,554
but because of you
and the way you've treated me,

1025
01:26:09,063 --> 01:26:10,690
like a lady.

1026
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:12,958
I want you to have
that something big.

1027
01:26:13,134 --> 01:26:16,262
So I'll just go inside
while you settle it with Mr. Cobb.

1028
01:26:16,437 --> 01:26:20,373
But please, please be careful.

1029
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,455
It's the devil demanding his due,
laddie.

1030
01:26:40,094 --> 01:26:41,755
I've been thinking about you,
colonel.

1031
01:26:42,096 --> 01:26:43,188
Have you?

1032
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:46,299
I've been thinking about you too,
Baker.

1033
01:26:53,641 --> 01:26:55,939
I've been thinking about you
for days and days.

1034
01:26:56,678 --> 01:26:58,407
Yeah?
Well, I was just telling Tommy here...

1035
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:02,611
Now, hold on, colonel.
It was all a mistake.

1036
01:27:02,784 --> 01:27:04,342
Now, if I'd have known...

1037
01:27:07,088 --> 01:27:10,148
Wait, now, you see, if you're gonna
fight, I don't wanna fight...

1038
01:27:16,531 --> 01:27:18,465
- Get out of the way.
- Yes, sir.

1039
01:27:18,633 --> 01:27:21,898
Oh, colonel, don't hit him again.
Let's talk about it.

1040
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:28,204
Oh, Mary Anna.

1041
01:27:28,376 --> 01:27:30,469
- Donald.
- Oh, you look lovely.

1042
01:27:31,212 --> 01:27:34,079
What are you doing with that dog?
Whose dog is that?!

1043
01:27:35,216 --> 01:27:36,308
It's mine.

1044
01:27:41,623 --> 01:27:43,989
She hasn't been touched.
Nobody laid a hand on her.

1045
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:45,182
Argh!

1046
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:51,489
I was planning
on bringing her to you.

1047
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:53,133
Ask her if you don't believe me.

1048
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:01,169
Aah! It's enough, do you hear me?
Enough.

1049
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:03,207
You're both just alike.

1050
01:28:03,378 --> 01:28:05,938
Has he taken advantage of you?

1051
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:09,982
- No. He was gonna bring me to you.
Oh.

1052
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:17,114
You got that there woman for me?

1053
01:28:17,725 --> 01:28:18,851
His wife?

1054
01:28:19,027 --> 01:28:21,120
Were you gonna give my wife
to him?

1055
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:24,265
Look, colonel, me and you,
we don't have to fight again, do we?

1056
01:28:24,432 --> 01:28:25,660
- Yep.
- Donald...

1057
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:28,802
Baker. You and me, we got a deal.

1058
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:30,801
The big gun for a woman.

1059
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:35,068
I don't get the woman,
you don't get the big gun.

1060
01:28:38,012 --> 01:28:39,502
Luis.

1061
01:28:44,786 --> 01:28:47,220
I got 20 guns
and they're all aimed at you.

1062
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:49,652
So that ends your argument.
The big gun is mine.

1063
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:52,622
No, hold on a minute now.
The gun is federal property.

1064
01:28:52,794 --> 01:28:54,523
- You can't have it.
- Let him have it.

1065
01:28:54,696 --> 01:28:56,493
Let him have it?
It's government property.

1066
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:58,689
- I'm a colonel of the cavalry...
No, you're not.

1067
01:28:58,866 --> 01:29:00,629
- What?
- You were retired two days ago.

1068
01:29:00,802 --> 01:29:03,600
You have nothing to say
about that gun.

1069
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:05,097
Let him have it.

1070
01:29:10,545 --> 01:29:11,569
Ah.

1071
01:29:18,152 --> 01:29:21,144
Ugh!
- Get off my wagon.

1072
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:50,745
All right, men, we ride.

1073
01:30:10,605 --> 01:30:12,300
Giddyap.

1074
01:30:43,704 --> 01:30:46,605
Excuse me, Mary,
I'll just be a moment.

1075
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:58,642
Where are you going, Cobb?

1076
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:02,847
Just about as far away from here
as I can get.

1077
01:31:03,257 --> 01:31:04,849
I gotta have a woman.

1078
01:31:05,026 --> 01:31:08,223
What about your friend there?
You wanna bury him?

1079
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:09,555
No.

1080
01:31:09,997 --> 01:31:13,626
Maybe something will come out
of the hills tonight and drag him off.

1081
01:31:15,369 --> 01:31:18,827
- All I wanted was a woman.
- Mm-hm.

1082
01:31:29,217 --> 01:31:30,548
Cobb.

1083
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:37,713
It just happens that we know
about a couple of women.

1084
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:40,090
On this side?

1085
01:31:40,261 --> 01:31:42,661
No, just over the border.

1086
01:31:43,297 --> 01:31:46,994
No, now, that don't help me
an awful lot, does it?

1087
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:51,096
Well, I just thought I'd let you know.

1088
01:32:13,327 --> 01:32:15,056
What are you setting out here for,
mister?

1089
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:18,064
I can't cross that there line.

1090
01:32:18,232 --> 01:32:22,032
Everybody wants to kill me.
There's a price on my head.

1091
01:32:34,482 --> 01:32:36,040
Unh!

1092
01:34:38,472 --> 01:34:40,064
Wait here.

1093
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:14,435
What do you make of it, lad?

1094
01:35:14,608 --> 01:35:17,805
- Where are they?
I do not know.

1095
01:35:17,978 --> 01:35:20,572
You'd better find them, Luis,
because I'm about to get mad.

1096
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,725
<i>Si, that's Emilio Estevez.</i>

1097
01:35:49,243 --> 01:35:50,403
Uh...

1098
01:35:58,586 --> 01:36:02,852
<i>- No.
- Si, that is Emilio Estevez.</i>

1099
01:36:29,383 --> 01:36:32,580
Tell me, you're not Emilio Estevez?

1100
01:36:32,753 --> 01:36:35,483
I am Brother Emilio Estevez.

1101
01:36:35,656 --> 01:36:37,351
The biggest bandit in Mexico?

1102
01:36:37,525 --> 01:36:41,086
Heh, heh, heh.
No. Those days are gone.

1103
01:36:41,262 --> 01:36:43,890
Those days are over, praise God.

1104
01:36:44,064 --> 01:36:45,122
Over?

1105
01:36:45,299 --> 01:36:47,665
I was once a man of great evil

1106
01:36:47,835 --> 01:36:50,497
and walked in the shadows
of wickedness.

1107
01:36:50,671 --> 01:36:53,697
But God, in his infinite mercy,
found me

1108
01:36:53,874 --> 01:36:57,469
and delivered me
into the garden of heaven.

1109
01:36:57,645 --> 01:37:00,739
Then there's no treasure?

1110
01:37:00,915 --> 01:37:03,748
See the lilies in the field,
how they grow?

1111
01:37:03,918 --> 01:37:06,011
They neither toil nor spin.

1112
01:37:06,187 --> 01:37:11,454
But even Solomon, in all his glory,
was never clothed like one of these.

1113
01:37:23,637 --> 01:37:25,867
This is our treasure, brother.

1114
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:28,531
We share it with you.

1115
01:37:35,149 --> 01:37:36,707
No.

1116
01:37:37,918 --> 01:37:39,408
No.

1117
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:34,966
Let's get out of here.

1118
01:38:49,690 --> 01:38:51,453
What kind of a mess are we in now?

1119
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:54,253
I don't know,
but I wish I was back in the Army.

1120
01:39:07,341 --> 01:39:08,638
Here come your Indians.

1121
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:26,984
This is a right pickle.
Us here and the gun down there.

1122
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:42,506
Hey, they're leaving us.

1123
01:39:50,651 --> 01:39:51,675
Where they going?

1124
01:39:52,286 --> 01:39:54,083
They've used up your whiskey.

1125
01:39:59,159 --> 01:40:01,354
Get in between them
and head us out of here.

1126
01:40:01,996 --> 01:40:03,827
Hiyah!

1127
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:07,562
Here he comes.
Here comes the gun.

1128
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:17,867
We've done it. We've done it.

1129
01:41:18,038 --> 01:41:20,472
Baker! Baker!

1130
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:27,604
We did it, laddie. We did it.

1131
01:41:29,349 --> 01:41:31,010
The gold. Where's the gold?

1132
01:41:34,288 --> 01:41:36,256
Where else?

1133
01:41:49,736 --> 01:41:52,000
There go the last of them.

1134
01:42:38,519 --> 01:42:40,680
Here it is, men.

1135
01:42:42,689 --> 01:42:43,883
Oh.

1136
01:42:44,057 --> 01:42:45,752
Look at that.

1137
01:43:12,486 --> 01:43:14,750
<i>Nay, pack up, Baker.</i>

1138
01:43:14,922 --> 01:43:17,015
<i>For if you intend to marry with me,</i>

1139
01:43:17,191 --> 01:43:20,820
<i>it's back you go now
to the land that spawned you.</i>

1140
01:43:20,994 --> 01:43:24,691
<i>I couldn't say no to you doing
something big in your life,</i>

1141
01:43:24,865 --> 01:43:30,030
<i>but I have a life too,
and you best be remembering it now.</i>

1142
01:43:30,404 --> 01:43:32,998
<i>You're not make-believe, lad.</i>

1143
01:43:33,173 --> 01:43:37,041
<i>You're not
the G|reat Big Western Show.</i>

1144
01:43:57,431 --> 01:43:58,591
No regrets?

1145
01:43:58,765 --> 01:44:01,131
Oh, no regrets, my dear. No.

1146
01:44:01,301 --> 01:44:03,861
It's not the end, you know.
It's the beginning.

1147
01:44:04,605 --> 01:44:06,573
Remember what I wrote you last year

1148
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:07,934
about missing you so badly?

1149
01:44:08,108 --> 01:44:09,837
You said you would give your boots
and saddle

1150
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:12,501
- to spend one night with me.
- Shh.

1151
01:44:12,679 --> 01:44:15,546
Well, I don't have
boots and saddle any longer.

1152
01:44:15,716 --> 01:44:17,809
- But all your nights.
- Heh, heh.

1153
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:23,685
Present arms!

1154
01:44:47,314 --> 01:44:49,407
Thanks for my share, Joe.

1155
01:44:53,053 --> 01:44:56,386
Close ranks. Ho!

1156
01:44:57,357 --> 01:44:59,188
You've got a fine big man there,
Mrs. Morgan.

1157
01:45:01,428 --> 01:45:03,362
I think we're both fortunate,
Miss MacBride.

1158
01:45:04,264 --> 01:45:06,528
Aye, we are that.

1159
01:45:17,444 --> 01:45:19,344
Mind your step, my dear.

1160
01:45:19,513 --> 01:45:21,481
Be with you in a moment.

1161
01:45:22,883 --> 01:45:25,647
Now, Jesse, my replacement
will be here before long.

1162
01:45:25,819 --> 01:45:27,684
He's unfamiliar with the territory,

1163
01:45:27,854 --> 01:45:29,947
but I'm sure
with your able assistance, I...

1164
01:45:30,123 --> 01:45:32,091
I'll do everything I can to help him,
colonel.

1165
01:45:32,259 --> 01:45:36,127
Yes, I'm sure you will. God help him.

1166
01:45:36,296 --> 01:45:39,094
Now, sergeant, that's for you.

1167
01:45:39,266 --> 01:45:42,133
You drink it in good health
and may you be in heaven

1168
01:45:42,302 --> 01:45:45,203
a half hour before the devil knows
you're there. Heh, heh, heh.

1169
01:45:45,372 --> 01:45:48,000
- Goodbye, sergeant.
- Sir, I...

1170
01:45:48,208 --> 01:45:51,575
Here, here, here.
Get a grip on yourself, man.

1171
01:45:52,546 --> 01:45:54,776
You've been in the Army too long,
sergeant.

1172
01:45:54,948 --> 01:45:56,006
Entirely too long.

1173
01:45:56,183 --> 01:45:58,014
Column two, to the left!

1174
01:46:06,893 --> 01:46:09,191
Forward! Ho!

1175
01:46:16,203 --> 01:46:20,139
I'm still gonna write that letter!

1176
01:46:20,574 --> 01:46:22,542
You just see if I don't!

1177
01:46:30,417 --> 01:46:32,442
Finest light cavalry in the world.

1178
01:47:24,771 --> 01:47:27,763
It was a dark day
I humbled my poor body to you,

1179
01:47:28,108 --> 01:47:30,235
you great ape.

1180
01:47:36,383 --> 01:47:37,714
I love him.
