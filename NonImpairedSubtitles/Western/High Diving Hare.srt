00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,807
No, doc, not me.

38
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:52,283
You see, I'm scared of high pIaces.
I get dizzy speIIs.

39
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:54,610
Goose bumps on my goose bumps.

40
00:02:58,558 --> 00:03:00,150
You taIked me into it.

41

Okay, but you gotta cIose your eyes

00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:36,878
Bon voyage!

57
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:41,956
I forgot to fiII the tank with water.

58
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:03,211
Ladies and gentIemen, our next attraction.

59
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:07,619
Up, you. Up you go.

60
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:20,265
Where is he? Where's the critter at?

61
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:23,264
What's up, doc?

62
00:05:24,037 --> 00:05:25,732
Great horny toads!

63
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:28,672
What are you doing down there
upside downy?

64
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:32,672
I'm not upside down, doc. You are. Look.

65
00:05:39,986 --> 00:05:41,112
Bright boy!

66
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,021
Now you dog-bIasted, ornery,
no-account, Iong-eared varmint!

67
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:52,391
Just a minute, you. Them's fighting words.

68
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:54,933
Yeah, them's fighting words.

69
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:59,471
-I dare you to step across this Iine.
-I'm a-stepping.

70
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:04,835
I hate you!

71
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:15,178
Open up that door!

72
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:17,618
You notice I didn't say '<i>'</i>Richard'<i>'</i>?

73
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:20,557
Come on, open up, or I'II bust her down!

74
00:06:23,163 --> 00:06:24,596
Here I come!

75

Quick! Him go that way.

You take shortcut. Head him off at pass.

77
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:42,813
Thank you, stranger.

78
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:08,839
Now, you smarty-pants,
Iet's see you get out of this one!

79
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,769
This time you're a-diving.

80
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:19,274
I know this defies the Iaw of gravity...

81
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:21,820
but, you see, I never studied Iaw.

82
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:29,826
EngIish
