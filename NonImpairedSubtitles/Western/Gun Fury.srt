1
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:10,304
People talk about Billy the Kid,
or Wes Hardin, or Sam Bass.

2
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,975
They're tough and they're bad,
but there aren't any as bad as Frank Slayton.

3
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,677
Sandwich, Miss Ballard?

4
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:18,152
No, thank you. I'll wait till Rodger's Station.

5
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,984
- Mr. Hampton?
- No, thanks.

6
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:23,287
Three weeks ago,
he and his gang rode into Taos.

7
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:27,159
Murdered four people. Burned and looted.
Carried off two Indian girls.

8
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,729
Is that why they sent these soldiers along?

9
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:32,859
You see the strongbox we're carrying? Gold.

10
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:36,930
- Frightened, Mr. Weatherby?
- Yes, sir. I admit it.

11
00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:39,605
Why don't you stay out
of this part of the country?

12
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:42,770
I can't. I'm a bones buyer.
Buffalo bones, that is.

13
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:44,642
I sell them for fertilizer.

14
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:47,581
But, Mr. Hampton,
what are you doing out this way?

15
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:52,019
- You're a Southerner, aren't you?
- Yes. An unreconstructed Southerner.

16
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:56,688
I saw my home, Richmond,
after Grant and his men got through with it.

17
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,657
I know how you feel.
My home was in Atlanta.

18
00:03:01,497 --> 00:03:05,228
My sympathies, Miss Ballard.
We have a great deal in common.

19
00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:08,234
Intending to stay out here in the West?

20
00:03:08,304 --> 00:03:11,296
Yes. The man I'm going to marry
is meeting me in Haynesville.

21
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:13,604
We'll go on to California from there.

22
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:16,372
- San Francisco?
- Oh, no. He has a ranch.

23
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:20,343
- Ever lived on a ranch?
- No, but I'm sure that I'll like it.

24
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:27,146
Better wake up, Mr. Burgess,
we're pulling into Rodger's Station.

25
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:50,975
Harris, take your men back to Fort Grant
for replacements.

26
00:04:01,424 --> 00:04:03,824
Perhaps you'll join me for dinner,
Miss Ballard.

27
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:06,589
That's kind of you, but I'm afraid that I can't.

28
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:09,495
He's not meeting you here,
the man you're going to marry?

29
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:11,123
No. In Haynesville, tomorrow.

30
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,567
Then I can't permit you to refuse.
Why should you dine alone?

31
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:18,763
I'm quite flattered, Mr. Hampton.
But you'll have to permit me to refuse.

32
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:24,475
Don't worry about it, Mr. Hampton.
I'll eat with you.

33
00:04:24,547 --> 00:04:28,005
If I'd known that, Mr. Burgess,
I wouldn't have asked the lady.

34
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,178
Hurry up with that strongbox.

35
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:43,196
We don't get many Southern ladies
coming through the station.

36
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:46,800
Say, that's beautiful.

37
00:04:47,136 --> 00:04:49,263
It's a wedding present from my family.

38
00:04:49,338 --> 00:04:52,774
There's a fine minister in Haynesville,
Mr. Midgely.

39
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:56,376
- Are you going to be married in the church?
- Yes, of course.

40
00:04:56,446 --> 00:04:58,437
That's the only way to do it.

41
00:04:58,514 --> 00:05:00,914
I'll go and fix you a cup of tea.

42
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,217
And I'll bring you some of my biscuits.
I baked them myself.

43
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:11,490
She's quite a woman, isn't she?

44
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:13,952
As far as I'm concerned, all women are alike.

45
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,590
They just got different faces
so you can tell them apart.

46
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,726
To a man without taste,
I suppose all things are alike.

47
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:23,899
She's as different from other women
as cognac is from corn liquor.

48
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:27,067
You get the same kind of headache
from either one.

49
00:05:27,143 --> 00:05:29,941
She can smile without making it a simper.

50
00:05:30,012 --> 00:05:32,708
That's a rare quality in a woman, Jess.

51
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,184
She's also getting married
at the next stop. Remember?

52
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,812
Yes, to a grubby dirt farmer.

53
00:05:39,555 --> 00:05:41,523
What'll she look like a year from now?

54
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,890
What difference does it make to you?
It's hello and goodbye.

55
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:48,125
A sad thought. Don't you think so?

56
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:50,760
Stay away from her.

57
00:05:53,736 --> 00:05:56,364
- What did you say?
- Stay away from her.

58
00:05:57,673 --> 00:06:01,575
My private affairs are private.
Don't ever forget it again.

59
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,478
- Who is it?
- It's me, Mrs. Rodgers.

60
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,520
Ben!

61
00:06:28,604 --> 00:06:30,071
Ben, I thought...

62
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,700
I rode all night and all day.
It was easier than waiting.

63
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:39,013
Mrs. Rodgers, you'd better find me a room...

64
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:42,016
if you're planning on running
a decent hotel.

65
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:47,514
- You know...
- I guess...

66
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:52,727
Riding across the desert,
I kept thinking what I'd say to you.

67
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:53,955
Now I can't remember.

68
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,554
Have I changed?

69
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,829
Prettier than ever.

70
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,566
I tried so hard to remember
exactly what you looked like.

71
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:08,974
The smell of your hair, your pretty eyes.

72
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:11,309
Ben, I've never been so happy.

73
00:07:11,914 --> 00:07:14,712
I just can't believe that we're really together.

74
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:17,443
I've waited so long, Ben.

75
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,714
When the war ended,
I thought the waiting was over.

76
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:23,783
And then when I had to wait again...

77
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:27,556
I guess I thought
it would never really happen.

78
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,620
It has, Jenny.

79
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:33,861
But I'll make it up to you
for every one of those years.

80
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:39,875
There'll be a lady sitting here.

81
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:41,876
Have you any white wine?

82
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:46,582
I almost got married once myself.

83
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:50,050
It was all set till her family came West
in a covered wagon.

84
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:54,055
If you could have seen her family,
you'd know why the wagon was covered.

85
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,787
Miss Ballard, you're just in time for supper.

86
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:03,764
Mr. Hampton, this is my fiancé, Mr. Warren.

87
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:06,392
A surprise and a pleasure.

88
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:09,403
Mr. Hampton is one of the
coach passengers.

89
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:10,530
How do you do?

90
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:14,337
We've been looking forward to meeting you.
I hope you'll join us for supper.

91
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,708
- Thank you, but he's...
- Why not?

92
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,374
This may not be
the mansion house in Atlanta...

93
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:23,247
but you'll make three lonely bachelors
think it is.

94
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,184
Mr. Burgess, Mr. Warren.

95
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,415
- Mr. Weatherby, Mr. Warren.
- Glad to know you.

96
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,821
Be seated.

97
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:39,194
I tell you, the South had a better Army.

98
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,396
We rode better, we fought better,
we were led by better men.

99
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:43,904
And so we were defeated.

100
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:47,431
Defeat. Fellow once said, "What is defeat?"
You go home.

101
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,811
- War is terrible.
- Not always, Miss Ballard.

102
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:54,507
When a man's dead, he don't worry
about the color of his uniform.

103
00:08:55,051 --> 00:08:57,383
I still say
the war could have been prevented.

104
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,183
- How?
- By peaceful means.

105
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:03,055
Negotiation, compromise, reason.

106
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:08,220
If you stay out in the West, you're going to
find you can't negotiate with a bowie knife...

107
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,094
or reason with a six-shooter.

108
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,861
I seen Gettysburg.

109
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:14,994
Two years later,
you could still smell the blood.

110
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:18,040
And I saw Richmond
after they burned it to the ground.

111
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:20,974
I've seen enough
and I've had enough of killing.

112
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:23,341
I'm sick of violence and force.

113
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,842
I learned one thing:
bullets are very democratic.

114
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:30,511
They kill good men as well as bad.
I'd like to try the other way.

115
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:35,314
Try it. But I fought your war, too,
and I saw a world die: my world.

116
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:38,556
And what destroyed it? Force, Mr. Warren.

117
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:43,325
The war is over.
We can't go on thinking about it forever.

118
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:47,524
I've forgotten it.
I'm interested only in the future...

119
00:09:47,737 --> 00:09:50,831
because that's where we're going to spend
the rest of our lives.

120
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:53,807
I spent five years
fighting somebody else's quarrel.

121
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,642
Now I don't quarrel with anyone.

122
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:59,574
By not carrying a gun?
Is that how you do it?

123
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:01,707
By staying in my own back yard...

124
00:10:01,784 --> 00:10:05,686
which, in this case, happens to be
1,200 acres of good California land.

125
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:08,189
Twelve hundred acres.

126
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:11,818
You can stand on the front porch
and see straight ahead for three days.

127
00:10:11,894 --> 00:10:15,421
The ocean's the west boundary
and the river's the east boundary.

128
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:18,157
For me, that's the whole world.

129
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:22,603
And what happens on the other side
of the river is no concern of yours?

130
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:24,138
That's right.

131
00:10:26,675 --> 00:10:29,735
Mr. Warren, would you mind
if I danced with the bride-to-be?

132
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:31,177
Not at all.

133
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,234
Do you mind if I cut in, Mr. Hampton?

134
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:06,876
I'm not much of a dancer, Miss Ballard.
I guess I got two left feet.

135
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,791
- So you're gonna be married in Haynesville?
- Yes, tomorrow evening.

136
00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:24,264
That's the worst town in Arizona.
Gamblers, cutthroats, loose women.

137
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,595
But I heard it was very...

138
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:29,627
Why don't you take the stage to Tucson
tomorrow? There's a nice mission there.

139
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:32,401
At night, the stars come right down
and kiss you.

140
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:34,601
It sounds very beautiful, Mr. Burgess...

141
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:37,976
but I think maybe
we'd better keep going on to California.

142
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:41,813
You wouldn't lose but a few days.
It's a real spot for a honeymoon, ma'am.

143
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:44,409
A place to remember the rest of your life.

144
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:50,791
Thank you, Mr. Burgess.

145
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:52,690
And for the thoughtful suggestion.

146
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:56,561
I'd do it if I were you, ma'am.
You might not get another opportunity.

147
00:11:58,267 --> 00:12:01,430
We haven't had a dance yet.
I hope they play some more.

148
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:02,970
We'll wait till they do.

149
00:12:03,038 --> 00:12:04,938
The stage leaves early.

150
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:07,870
If we take Mr. Burgess' advice,
we won't be on it.

151
00:12:07,943 --> 00:12:10,434
He thinks we ought to visit Tucson.

152
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:14,512
We're going to California, Ben.

153
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:17,247
We can't get there too soon for me.

154
00:13:08,837 --> 00:13:11,135
I've never seen anything so beautiful.

155
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:15,335
- You will when we get home.
- Home?

156
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:21,314
The most peaceful spot on earth:
ocean all green, sky blue, earth good.

157
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,518
It's like an island.

158
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:27,851
Sun shining all day long,
soft breezes blowing in from the ocean.

159
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:31,918
It's what I've always dreamed of.

160
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:34,561
It's all I've dreamed about, too.

161
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,501
That must be the new escort.
We'd better hurry.

162
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:49,870
I hope you're prepared for a rough ride.
That cavalry patrol's a bit late.

163
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:52,209
We'll get to Haynesville
just that much sooner.

164
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:54,841
- Where's your horse?
- I sold it.

165
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,962
Men, you're late. Where's Sgt. Davis?

166
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,633
He turned in a sick call.
That's why we was delayed.

167
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:20,970
Position.

168
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:27,374
- All ready here.
- It's about time.

169
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:15,012
What's going on up there?

170
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,553
- Ben, what's happened?
- It's a holdup.

171
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:22,528
I'll take that.

172
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:25,260
I believe a new set of introductions
are in order.

173
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:27,325
My name is Frank Slayton.

174
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:30,394
And this is Tom Burgess,
better known as Jess.

175
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:33,338
And those Yank soldiers out there
are my men...

176
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:36,104
formerly the Army of Northern Virginia.

177
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,609
Get that strongbox.

178
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:52,654
You know where the horses are, Doc.
Go get them.

179
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:54,355
All right, come on out.

180
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,232
You first, Miss Ballard.

181
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:05,136
Thanks for cooperating, Lieutenant.

182
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:07,232
I'd like to use him for a target.

183
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:11,507
And start the war between the states again?
I'm surprised at you, Blinky.

184
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,380
- All right, Weatherby, come on out.
- What are you going to do with us?

185
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,475
I got him.

186
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:51,150
He's dead.

187
00:17:53,622 --> 00:17:55,681
Curly, get her on a horse.

188
00:18:36,632 --> 00:18:39,692
Vincente, look at that beautiful sack of gold.

189
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:45,134
If she's part of the take,
how do we split her up?

190
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,698
Same as the gold: share and share alike.

191
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:50,438
Forget my share of the gold.
I'll settle for her.

192
00:18:50,512 --> 00:18:54,778
Better take your share of the gold. When you
get to Barratto's you can buy three like her.

193
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,818
At Barratto's? Like her?

194
00:19:01,556 --> 00:19:04,650
Bring in the strongbox.
We'll split up the gold.

195
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,836
What's the matter?
Doesn't she like our cooking?

196
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,402
- Says she ain't hungry.
- Well, I am.

197
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:28,743
Maybe you didn't hear me
when I asked you before.

198
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:31,615
- What are you planning to do with her?
- I heard you before.

199
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:33,780
I want to know what you got in mind.

200
00:19:33,855 --> 00:19:36,653
If anybody else tried to push me like that,
I'd kill him.

201
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:38,716
Don't chance your luck too far.

202
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,296
- Hey, those are mine.
- You can have her dress, Brazos.

203
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:44,559
You might look good in those skirts.

204
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:47,360
Get out there and saddle up.

205
00:19:57,245 --> 00:20:01,682
You should've eaten something,
Miss Ballard. We have a long ride ahead.

206
00:20:03,051 --> 00:20:04,712
Change into those.

207
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:07,815
I'll stay as I am.

208
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,249
Don't make me do it for you.

209
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:13,857
I meant what I said.

210
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:22,234
Go ahead. Show her
what a Southern gentleman you are.

211
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:25,665
You left the door open.
Go back and close it...

212
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:27,038
from the other side.

213
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:30,545
I'm not trying to run things,
but I won't let you drag her along...

214
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:32,341
I told you to get out.

215
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:35,081
What's happened to you?

216
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,141
When we started
we only went after carpetbaggers.

217
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,484
Then it was anybody
who had anything we wanted.

218
00:20:40,555 --> 00:20:42,352
Then it was Indian women. Now it's her.

219
00:20:42,424 --> 00:20:45,882
What would you have done,
left her in the middle of the desert alone?

220
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:48,191
No. But we can leave her here.

221
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:55,101
All right, Jess. Have it your way.

222
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,895
All right! Take him out and tie him up.

223
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:33,138
You wouldn't wear those clothes,
would you?

224
00:21:42,717 --> 00:21:44,981
There must be some sense of honor
left in you.

225
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,544
There isn't much of that
left anywhere in the world.

226
00:21:47,622 --> 00:21:50,250
Ordinary men live by ordinary laws.

227
00:21:50,325 --> 00:21:51,917
I'm not an ordinary man.

228
00:21:51,993 --> 00:21:54,359
The laws I need,
I make for my own convenience.

229
00:22:00,202 --> 00:22:02,636
Get her on the horse. Get mounted!

230
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:08,108
I told you before,
there couldn't be two generals.

231
00:22:09,511 --> 00:22:11,775
You want to go with us, or stay here?

232
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:15,473
You'd last about 24 hours.

233
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:19,679
Once I get mounted, you got a
half a minute to make up your mind.

234
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:22,584
If you want out of this, just yell out.

235
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:26,021
I never crawled for nobody.
I'm not about to now.

236
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:47,107
If you change your mind, just call out.

237
00:22:47,182 --> 00:22:48,672
That'll do it.

238
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,527
Where is she?

239
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,392
You look very much alive for a dead man.

240
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:29,630
What'd they do with my girl?

241
00:26:29,938 --> 00:26:32,065
Slayton decided to keep her.

242
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:34,170
- Where are they headed?
- Mexico.

243
00:26:34,242 --> 00:26:35,834
Where in Mexico?

244
00:26:37,545 --> 00:26:41,481
- Think you got a prayer against that outfit?
- Where are they taking her?

245
00:26:42,884 --> 00:26:45,478
There's a price for that information.

246
00:26:46,254 --> 00:26:47,744
I go with you.

247
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:05,699
Slayton did that?

248
00:27:07,275 --> 00:27:08,902
I didn't tie myself up.

249
00:27:09,144 --> 00:27:11,135
I don't have to ask you why.

250
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,271
You tried to keep us off that coach.

251
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:15,009
You can thank me while we ride.

252
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,779
You can't ride,
and I ain't got any time to wait for you.

253
00:27:17,852 --> 00:27:19,945
We need each other, Warren.

254
00:27:20,188 --> 00:27:22,748
I'm going to help you get your girl...

255
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:25,224
and you're going to help me get Slayton.

256
00:27:26,127 --> 00:27:28,595
That horse is going to have to carry
both of us...

257
00:27:28,663 --> 00:27:30,654
if you want any information from me.

258
00:27:39,174 --> 00:27:40,971
There's a sheep camp.

259
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,323
Light and rest awhile.

260
00:27:57,392 --> 00:28:00,259
That's a lot of weight
for one horse to be carrying, ain't it?

261
00:28:00,328 --> 00:28:02,455
How about selling us one of yours?

262
00:28:02,564 --> 00:28:06,466
We got a sorrel you can have,
$50, saddle and all.

263
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:07,558
I'll take it.

264
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:11,332
We're after the Slayton gang.
We could use some guns and ammunition.

265
00:28:12,173 --> 00:28:15,540
Put a bridle on that sorrel.
Let them have some guns.

266
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,177
Some riders passed us last night.

267
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,173
Our fires was lit, but they stayed clear.

268
00:28:21,382 --> 00:28:22,576
How long ago?

269
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:25,244
Seven, eight hours. Headed southwest.

270
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,249
They weren't riding fast, though.

271
00:28:27,322 --> 00:28:29,085
They held up a stage yesterday.

272
00:28:29,157 --> 00:28:31,751
Killed three men
and carried off one of the passengers.

273
00:28:31,826 --> 00:28:34,056
The girl I was going to marry.

274
00:28:34,329 --> 00:28:35,990
We could use some help.

275
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:39,090
Believe me, there's nothing we'd like more,
all of us.

276
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:41,361
But we just can't up and leave these sheep.

277
00:28:41,436 --> 00:28:44,928
Couldn't some of your men come along
with us? It'd make a big difference.

278
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:49,466
Mister, if you know anything about sheep,
you know we can't spare a hand just now.

279
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:52,578
How much do we owe you?

280
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,878
$50 for the horse
and about $78 for the guns.

281
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,885
- It'll take that much to replace them.
- Get used to the idea.

282
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:02,946
It's just two of us now, and it'll just be
two of us when we catch up with them.

283
00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:05,356
Sorry we couldn't help you more.

284
00:29:19,274 --> 00:29:22,471
- Would you like some water, ma'am?
- No, thank you.

285
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,416
We'll be stopping soon.

286
00:29:30,652 --> 00:29:33,382
We went by a town back there.
Why didn't you let me go?

287
00:29:33,454 --> 00:29:35,649
And have half the population after me?

288
00:29:35,723 --> 00:29:38,920
It'd take me till nightfall to ride back there.
You'd be safe.

289
00:29:38,993 --> 00:29:40,722
I can't do that, Miss Ballard.

290
00:29:40,795 --> 00:29:42,763
Why? Why can't you let me go?

291
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:46,825
When I first saw you, it brought back things
I hadn't thought of in years.

292
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:49,267
Richmond, the ladies in fancy dresses...

293
00:29:49,337 --> 00:29:51,328
garden parties, dances.

294
00:29:52,974 --> 00:29:55,306
It gets lonely out here for someone like me.

295
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:59,335
The only women are the ones you find
in saloons, and they're not my kind.

296
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:02,749
- You are.
- Am I?

297
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:04,850
You're a murderer.

298
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:06,750
No more than the man
you were gonna marry.

299
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:09,984
You wouldn't call him a murderer.
Yet he killed in the war to live.

300
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,993
His war stopped. Mine didn't.

301
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,983
There's a saloon over there.

302
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:45,283
- Looking for the sheriff?
- Yes.

303
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,351
He's in the barber chair.

304
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:53,661
- Sheriff.
- What can I do for you?

305
00:30:53,735 --> 00:30:56,329
The Slayton gang rode past here last night,
heading south.

306
00:30:56,404 --> 00:30:57,962
I'd like some help to go after them.

307
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:59,973
- Who are you?
- My name's Warren.

308
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:02,271
I was a passenger on the Haynesville stage.

309
00:31:02,343 --> 00:31:04,334
Slayton held it up and kidnapped my girl.

310
00:31:04,412 --> 00:31:06,972
We heard the stage was overdue.

311
00:31:07,048 --> 00:31:09,516
Man come by this morning from Haynesville.

312
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:13,014
- What'd you say you wanted?
- Some men who can use a gun.

313
00:31:13,087 --> 00:31:16,648
From me? I only got two deputies,
and one of them is in Yuma.

314
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:20,251
- Get up a posse.
- You make it sound real easy. But it ain't.

315
00:31:20,328 --> 00:31:22,319
We got one up last week, Sheriff.

316
00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:24,388
That was for a hanging. That's different.

317
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,296
You want to go after Frank Slayton?

318
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:27,857
No, not me.

319
00:31:27,935 --> 00:31:29,800
It's not his job, it's yours.

320
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:32,398
The stage line don't go through here.

321
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,941
If it was held up, it'd be over in Gila County.

322
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:36,977
But they went past here not six hours ago.

323
00:31:37,045 --> 00:31:41,379
Look, mister, I got plenty of trouble
right here. I don't have to chase after it.

324
00:31:41,449 --> 00:31:45,476
Every Sunday morning, my jail's
got more people than the local church.

325
00:31:45,553 --> 00:31:48,818
What's that badge for?
You've got a responsibility.

326
00:31:48,956 --> 00:31:50,617
Just to this town.

327
00:31:52,026 --> 00:31:53,391
And nowheres else.

328
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:02,599
Hey, you want some gun hands,
try the saloon. You'll be doing me a favor.

329
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,161
My partner's trying that right now.

330
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:07,173
He told me I'd get no help from you.

331
00:32:07,241 --> 00:32:09,436
Maybe Slayton took your girl.

332
00:32:09,977 --> 00:32:14,311
In that case, I'm sorry for you, mister.
And even sorrier for the girl.

333
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:18,478
If it was my job to tangle
with the Slayton gang, I'd do it.

334
00:32:18,553 --> 00:32:21,147
But like I said, my job's right here.

335
00:32:25,393 --> 00:32:29,193
- How did you make out?
- Like I told you. Nobody's interested.

336
00:32:29,363 --> 00:32:31,490
I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

337
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:35,325
I remember telling Slayton
that first night at Rodger's Station.

338
00:32:35,403 --> 00:32:39,066
What happens on the other side of the river
is no problem of yours?

339
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,667
Yeah. So I guess I can't complain, can I?

340
00:32:41,742 --> 00:32:43,903
Do you know anybody
who feels any different?

341
00:32:43,978 --> 00:32:46,003
I learned one thing, Jess.

342
00:32:46,414 --> 00:32:50,282
A man's got to do his own growing,
no matter how tall his father was.

343
00:32:50,351 --> 00:32:52,683
Slayton's headed toward Rock Springs.

344
00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:56,883
It's not much of a town, but you can
try there. Maybe we'll have better luck.

345
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:35,594
Get mounted, Westy. You and Vincente
are going into Rock Springs for supplies.

346
00:33:35,663 --> 00:33:37,790
- You mean right now?
- Right now.

347
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:40,129
Get some liquor, too. We're out.

348
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:41,896
And keep out of trouble.

349
00:33:50,178 --> 00:33:52,806
We could do with a little coffee, Doc.

350
00:33:55,516 --> 00:33:58,178
You ought to smile a little more,
Miss Ballard.

351
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:02,520
- When are you going to let me go?
- When we're out of Arizona.

352
00:34:03,257 --> 00:34:04,656
When will that be?

353
00:34:04,926 --> 00:34:09,329
Arizonans are like Texans.
They say they're never out of Arizona.

354
00:34:19,674 --> 00:34:22,472
If it wasn't for her,
we'd all be at Barratto's by now.

355
00:34:22,543 --> 00:34:25,137
Have us a woman. And decent food.

356
00:34:25,446 --> 00:34:28,540
If you got any complaints to make, Blinky,
make them to me.

357
00:34:28,616 --> 00:34:31,210
I might be able to take care of them for you.

358
00:35:36,284 --> 00:35:38,479
Your man's dead.
It was his choice, not mine.

359
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:41,316
Next time you think of running away,
ask yourself where.

360
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,118
The answer's nowhere.

361
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,715
I took you because you're as alone as I am.

362
00:35:46,093 --> 00:35:50,291
You look at me like that because you live
in a world that doesn't exist anymore.

363
00:35:50,364 --> 00:35:53,697
We'd have met before the war, but we didn't.

364
00:35:54,368 --> 00:35:56,529
And it's a different world now, the South.

365
00:35:56,604 --> 00:35:58,231
A world with three armies:

366
00:35:58,306 --> 00:36:02,174
an army of mourners,
an army of cripples, and an army of thieves.

367
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:06,202
Fortunately, I'm still in one piece
and no one's crying over me.

368
00:36:27,368 --> 00:36:29,336
Fill the canteens, Jess.

369
00:36:38,612 --> 00:36:41,877
- Seen the Slayton gang?
- They ain't working this part of the state.

370
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,349
- Wrong. I've been trailing them.
- Hear that, boys?

371
00:36:44,418 --> 00:36:46,978
Man says the Slayton gang's
around here somewhere.

372
00:36:47,054 --> 00:36:49,852
- You seen them?
- I was on the stage they held up.

373
00:36:50,624 --> 00:36:53,024
- Go ahead. Help yourself.
- Thanks.

374
00:36:53,427 --> 00:36:55,691
There's no more than seven or eight men.

375
00:36:55,763 --> 00:36:58,323
- They don't know we're trailing them.
- Who's "we"?

376
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:01,596
I got a partner.
We could always use some more gun hands.

377
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:07,238
There's a pretty good reward
for the men who bring them in.

378
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,038
What reward have they got
for the men who try and don't?

379
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:12,238
They're right here in your own back yard.

380
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,077
If they want something from the ranches,
they'll take it.

381
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,912
Your women included.

382
00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:19,776
Then they'll wish
they never came through this county.

383
00:37:19,854 --> 00:37:23,483
Especially if they get a hold of my woman.
Your deal, Chuck.

384
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:29,563
Get ready. We're riding.

385
00:38:03,164 --> 00:38:05,462
It's Vincente, one of the gang.

386
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,327
There were two of them.

387
00:38:14,108 --> 00:38:15,905
No! We'll follow him.

388
00:39:45,432 --> 00:39:47,059
Where's Vincente?

389
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,500
- I think they got him.
- Who got him?

390
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:53,028
I only saw one of them.
He said he was on that stage you held up.

391
00:39:53,107 --> 00:39:54,938
- A big fellow?
- Yeah, real big.

392
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:56,567
- Wearing a gray shirt?
- That's him.

393
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,044
The other was outside.
They're trying to get a posse.

394
00:39:59,113 --> 00:40:02,276
- That's been tried before. We're still here.
- They're on our trail.

395
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:06,513
- What if they run into an Army patrol?
- We'll get started right now.

396
00:40:07,354 --> 00:40:09,754
And listen, it may not be Warren.

397
00:40:09,924 --> 00:40:12,324
I don't want a word of this to the girl.

398
00:40:15,396 --> 00:40:19,799
- I told you that woman would be trouble.
- He should have dumped her in the desert.

399
00:40:22,603 --> 00:40:24,366
We're breaking camp.

400
00:41:49,857 --> 00:41:51,449
It's no good. We have to stop awhile.

401
00:41:51,525 --> 00:41:53,459
If Slayton crosses the border, we're licked.

402
00:41:53,527 --> 00:41:56,553
Without horses, we're licked.
You can ride, but they need rest.

403
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,654
How far is it to Mexico?

404
00:41:57,731 --> 00:42:00,291
That won't make any difference
to the horses.

405
00:42:00,367 --> 00:42:02,597
All right, we'll rest awhile.

406
00:43:50,978 --> 00:43:53,776
He tried to kill you, Jess. Why?

407
00:43:53,847 --> 00:43:55,610
I think I know.

408
00:43:55,682 --> 00:43:57,673
Have you seen me before?

409
00:43:58,952 --> 00:44:00,977
Maybe he doesn't understand.

410
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:06,123
Him one of men who come and set fire.
They take our horses...

411
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,527
and my sister.

412
00:44:09,096 --> 00:44:11,223
He's talking about the Taos raid.

413
00:44:11,298 --> 00:44:14,358
I was there. But I didn't like what happened.
I tried to stop it.

414
00:44:14,434 --> 00:44:16,561
That raid is one reason
I'm not with them now.

415
00:44:16,637 --> 00:44:20,073
They took my woman.
He's helping me get her back.

416
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,040
They leave my sister in the desert to die.

417
00:44:22,109 --> 00:44:24,475
You want the man that did it?

418
00:44:24,545 --> 00:44:28,311
Slayton left me to die, too, tied to a stake.
See that?

419
00:44:34,454 --> 00:44:36,513
- You go after them?
- Yes.

420
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:39,619
You go, too?

421
00:44:41,395 --> 00:44:45,263
Slayton take life from me.
Now I take one from him.

422
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,834
I go, too.

423
00:44:48,902 --> 00:44:50,995
It's up to you, Jess.

424
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,706
You grab this?

425
00:44:58,879 --> 00:45:01,473
That makes us a party. A hunting party.

426
00:45:01,548 --> 00:45:03,038
War party.

427
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,463
Anybody hear something just then?

428
00:45:24,538 --> 00:45:27,302
What's the matter, Curly? Got the jumps?

429
00:45:36,283 --> 00:45:40,151
Don't say anything and don't look surprised.
He ain't dead.

430
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,587
The fellow you was going to marry.
He's alive and following us.

431
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:47,184
I have two horses at the bottom
of the slope. I'll start something.

432
00:45:47,261 --> 00:45:49,092
Don't go until I do.

433
00:45:57,704 --> 00:45:59,001
What's that?

434
00:45:59,072 --> 00:46:01,905
- Not again.
- Nobody heard nothing. Ease off.

435
00:46:01,975 --> 00:46:03,272
Well, I did.

436
00:46:04,144 --> 00:46:05,611
Go on and take a look.

437
00:46:48,121 --> 00:46:51,454
Mount up! Curly is trying to get away
with the girl!

438
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:11,897
So you tried to pull a sneak on us?

439
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,372
Yes, and I told her about Warren, too.

440
00:48:14,441 --> 00:48:16,170
Stake him out, Doc.

441
00:48:40,767 --> 00:48:44,703
I hope you weren't fooled
by what he told you. He was lying.

442
00:48:44,905 --> 00:48:46,463
Why should he be?

443
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:50,408
To get you to go with him.
I think it was a case of love at first sight.

444
00:48:50,477 --> 00:48:51,967
He was telling the truth.

445
00:48:52,045 --> 00:48:53,945
You shouldn't judge a man by his face.

446
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:57,450
Curly's been a thief and an outlaw
since he was 15.

447
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:01,009
Warren's dead. It isn't going to help you
to think he isn't.

448
00:49:01,354 --> 00:49:03,117
Get her back to camp.

449
00:49:39,793 --> 00:49:41,556
- Who is it?
- Curly Jordan.

450
00:49:41,628 --> 00:49:44,358
They staked him out
and rode their horses over him.

451
00:49:44,431 --> 00:49:46,991
Give me a hand. We'll cover him up.

452
00:50:05,552 --> 00:50:09,181
He probably got into trouble
the same way I did. He wasn't so lucky.

453
00:50:11,691 --> 00:50:13,181
They go in valley.

454
00:50:39,219 --> 00:50:42,711
Westy, you and Doc
round up the fresh horses.

455
00:50:50,931 --> 00:50:53,161
- Stella.
- In here.

456
00:50:54,167 --> 00:50:55,259
Where's your uncle?

457
00:50:55,335 --> 00:50:57,929
He went to Nogales. To get drunk.

458
00:50:58,004 --> 00:51:00,632
What's the matter?
Couldn't he get drunk here?

459
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:18,279
I wait and wait. I know you come back.

460
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:21,122
- You knew more than I did.
- How long you stay this time?

461
00:51:21,194 --> 00:51:24,254
Long enough to change horses.
We'll be back again.

462
00:51:24,364 --> 00:51:26,662
- Where you go?
- Mexico.

463
00:51:26,733 --> 00:51:29,600
Then I go to Mexico. We go together.

464
00:51:29,803 --> 00:51:31,202
Not this time, Stella.

465
00:51:31,271 --> 00:51:33,603
You say next time I go with you.

466
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:36,801
We gotta get across the border fast.
I'll send for you.

467
00:51:36,876 --> 00:51:40,175
You make me the promise.
This time you keep it.

468
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,080
<i>Sorry, chamaca, you're staying here.</i>

469
00:51:43,149 --> 00:51:46,744
No. I go with you. I get ready.

470
00:51:58,932 --> 00:52:01,867
Now I see why you say you no take me
to Mexico.

471
00:52:02,068 --> 00:52:03,228
Who is that?

472
00:52:03,303 --> 00:52:06,101
She's from the holdup.
It was dangerous to leave her behind.

473
00:52:06,172 --> 00:52:08,003
You have other woman?

474
00:52:08,074 --> 00:52:12,340
I told you a hundred times. You're my girl.
There isn't anyone else.

475
00:52:12,412 --> 00:52:14,903
I no believe you.

476
00:52:14,981 --> 00:52:16,505
But love is never equal.

477
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:20,314
One loves always more than the other.
I'm willing to be that one.

478
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:24,151
I understand. But we gotta
get across that border before nightfall.

479
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,784
- I told you, I'll send for you.
- When?

480
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:30,057
- Just as soon as we get things set.
- I'll never see you again.

481
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:32,792
Let's not fight about it.

482
00:52:32,866 --> 00:52:36,893
I'll do anything you want,
only don't take other woman.

483
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,864
Don't start that again.

484
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:47,541
- Stay away from her.
- She is your woman!

485
00:52:47,614 --> 00:52:48,638
Call her what you like.

486
00:52:48,715 --> 00:52:51,115
- Let me go with you, please.
- I said no.

487
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,950
You think you're finished with me!

488
00:53:04,731 --> 00:53:06,790
Keep her here and keep her quiet.

489
00:53:06,866 --> 00:53:08,993
I don't care how you do it.

490
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,274
<i>Take it easy, señoríta.</i>

491
00:53:25,352 --> 00:53:27,912
He ain't the only man in Arizona.

492
00:53:29,189 --> 00:53:31,316
There's me, for instance.

493
00:53:31,491 --> 00:53:32,480
You?

494
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,325
I'll be coming back this way.

495
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:37,854
- You come back?
- Sure.

496
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,626
And I'll have plenty of money, too.

497
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,859
You won't come back.

498
00:53:43,269 --> 00:53:45,829
If I did, would you wait?

499
00:53:47,507 --> 00:53:48,974
You like me?

500
00:53:51,711 --> 00:53:53,576
Why you no come closer?

501
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,744
Afraid of Slayton?

502
00:53:58,518 --> 00:54:00,247
I ain't afraid of nobody.

503
00:55:41,387 --> 00:55:43,184
Hey, Slayton.

504
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,757
It couldn't be nobody but Stella.

505
00:55:48,828 --> 00:55:50,295
I don't want her following us.

506
00:55:50,363 --> 00:55:51,523
Go ahead. I'll catch her.

507
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,896
Do you want me to shoot her,
the horse, or what?

508
00:55:53,967 --> 00:55:55,559
Suit yourself, Blinky.

509
00:56:57,797 --> 00:56:59,287
Jo, the water.

510
00:56:59,966 --> 00:57:01,797
It's the Morales girl.

511
00:57:01,868 --> 00:57:04,166
Another one of Slayton's women.

512
00:57:04,837 --> 00:57:07,567
It doesn't have to mean anything, Ben.

513
00:57:08,074 --> 00:57:10,269
What do we do with her?

514
00:57:11,878 --> 00:57:14,312
We can't leave her.

515
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:15,938
If we go back, we lose day.

516
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:20,577
We'd lose more than a day.
I got an idea she wouldn't go back.

517
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:23,018
We carry her.

518
00:58:02,362 --> 00:58:04,728
- How long will we be here?
- We leave in a few hours.

519
00:58:04,797 --> 00:58:07,459
Why not stay a couple of days
and rest up a bit?

520
00:58:07,533 --> 00:58:09,967
I said we'd leave in a few hours.

521
00:58:19,312 --> 00:58:22,042
If not for her, we wouldn't be running
like scared rabbits.

522
00:58:22,115 --> 00:58:24,811
For a change, I got to agree with you.

523
00:58:46,739 --> 00:58:48,604
I think you get killed or something.

524
00:58:48,675 --> 00:58:50,336
Who's gonna do it?

525
00:58:58,317 --> 00:59:00,808
- You take her to Mexico?
- I'm not leaving her here.

526
00:59:00,887 --> 00:59:03,014
- Let's have a drink.
- Sure.

527
00:59:03,222 --> 00:59:05,349
You should leave her with me, Frank.

528
00:59:05,425 --> 00:59:08,883
- Mexico is no place for such a one.
- Your place is?

529
00:59:08,961 --> 00:59:10,792
- Sure.
- Where are all the boys?

530
00:59:10,863 --> 00:59:13,923
They'll be back three, four days from now.

531
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,992
So, you bring her for yourself?
What you got for me?

532
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:19,265
Not a thing.

533
00:59:19,405 --> 00:59:21,066
How old is this one?

534
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:23,706
You sure you don't want
to leave her with me?

535
00:59:23,776 --> 00:59:24,936
Positive.

536
00:59:25,511 --> 00:59:26,603
<i>Señorítas.</i>

537
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:26,898
Barratto's place is just beyond that hill.

538
01:00:26,973 --> 01:00:29,737
That's less than a mile away.
Why don't we go in after them?

539
01:00:29,809 --> 01:00:32,073
I guess you don't know much
about Pete Barratto.

540
01:00:32,145 --> 01:00:33,476
No, I don't.

541
01:00:35,782 --> 01:00:38,216
He'll buy or sell anything, and does.

542
01:00:38,284 --> 01:00:41,310
Trades with the bandits in Mexico
and the outlaws in the States.

543
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:43,617
He has lots of gunmen there
ready to back him up.

544
01:00:43,689 --> 01:00:45,953
- They won't be expecting us.
- Why risk it?

545
01:00:46,025 --> 01:00:49,825
Slayton's going into Mexico
and he's got to go through there.

546
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,591
We'll be in those rocks above them.

547
01:00:51,664 --> 01:00:54,599
There's nothing to do but keep
the cinch tight a little longer.

548
01:00:54,667 --> 01:00:57,397
Grab some sleep. I'll take the first watch.

549
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:13,574
Why don't you try to get some sleep?

550
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,648
I cannot.

551
01:01:16,689 --> 01:01:19,487
- You think you kill Slayton?
- Yes.

552
01:01:19,725 --> 01:01:23,286
- Johash think he do it.
- Yes.

553
01:01:23,996 --> 01:01:25,930
Jess think he will do it.

554
01:01:27,233 --> 01:01:29,827
When the time come, I will be the one.

555
01:01:32,138 --> 01:01:34,902
Will killing him make any difference?

556
01:01:35,107 --> 01:01:38,804
- Will you feel any better when he's dead?
- Yes.

557
01:01:55,361 --> 01:01:57,625
Is good? You like?

558
01:02:13,412 --> 01:02:16,381
This water is still cold.
Could you get me some more?

559
01:02:38,137 --> 01:02:40,662
Please, you've got to help me.

560
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,932
This is for you.
You will help me, won't you?

561
01:02:45,177 --> 01:02:46,166
How?

562
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:53,114
Please! I cannot help you!

563
01:02:53,185 --> 01:02:55,949
These men are very bad! They will kill!

564
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:57,614
Please!

565
01:03:34,026 --> 01:03:35,857
You won't be needing that.

566
01:03:36,495 --> 01:03:39,555
It's not exactly to your taste, but I like it.

567
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:47,171
I'm taking you to Mexico with me.

568
01:03:49,475 --> 01:03:52,273
In Mexico we'll live the way
people like us ought to live.

569
01:03:52,345 --> 01:03:56,213
Comfortable and gracious.
The way the South was before the war.

570
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,746
Is that such a terrible thing to offer?

571
01:04:11,897 --> 01:04:14,388
By this time tomorrow, we'll be in Mexico.

572
01:04:14,467 --> 01:04:16,526
We gonna leave your woman here?

573
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:19,332
Maybe we ought to leave you here, Blinky.

574
01:04:19,872 --> 01:04:23,364
- Where are the saddlebags?
- They're inside.

575
01:05:19,465 --> 01:05:20,864
How did you get here?

576
01:05:20,933 --> 01:05:22,628
Are you with Warren?

577
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:26,270
Give me your spur, Westy.

578
01:05:29,141 --> 01:05:31,769
They will kill you! Each of them will kill you!

579
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:33,903
<i>Señor Warren, Jess. Johash!</i>

580
01:05:33,979 --> 01:05:34,968
Jess?

581
01:05:35,481 --> 01:05:36,914
Jess is with them?

582
01:05:37,783 --> 01:05:41,412
Jess knows which way we're headed.
They'll all be out there waiting for us.

583
01:05:41,487 --> 01:05:44,479
- Because we took that girl.
- I told you to shut up about her.

584
01:05:44,557 --> 01:05:46,525
You've had enough of her.
Now get rid of her.

585
01:05:46,592 --> 01:05:47,991
Are you telling me what to do?

586
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:51,552
- I'm telling you just what we think.
- Blinky's right.

587
01:05:51,764 --> 01:05:55,029
If we give them the girl back,
that'll get Warren out of the way.

588
01:05:55,134 --> 01:05:56,226
What about Jess?

589
01:05:56,302 --> 01:05:59,169
Warren will do anything to get his girl.
You can make a deal.

590
01:05:59,238 --> 01:06:01,729
- A deal?
- The girl for Jess.

591
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:04,467
The girl for Jess.

592
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:07,205
Just send word to Warren
you want to make a deal.

593
01:06:07,279 --> 01:06:09,907
If we can send word to him,
we can also find him...

594
01:06:09,982 --> 01:06:11,745
and make a deal with these.

595
01:06:11,817 --> 01:06:14,877
Do you know anybody who can
shoot faster or straighter than Jess?

596
01:06:14,954 --> 01:06:17,252
- I don't want to tangle with him.
- We got the gold.

597
01:06:17,323 --> 01:06:21,623
If we can dodge a fight, let's do it.
We don't know how many he's got with him.

598
01:06:21,694 --> 01:06:23,525
I don't want to die rich.

599
01:06:23,596 --> 01:06:26,258
Supposing Jess don't want to come in?

600
01:06:29,268 --> 01:06:32,431
He's got a big stake in this gold.
He'll come in.

601
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:37,933
I'll send word to Warren.
Get a hold of Barratto's boy.

602
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:53,255
- What are you gonna do?
- Go down to Barratto's.

603
01:06:53,325 --> 01:06:55,623
- Are you sure she wrote it?
- It's her writing.

604
01:06:55,694 --> 01:06:58,254
Slayton made her write it.

605
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:00,662
He wouldn't have sent it
unless he wanted a deal.

606
01:07:00,733 --> 01:07:04,635
There's only one kind of deal he knows,
the kind that comes out of a gun.

607
01:07:04,703 --> 01:07:06,830
Now's the time to be tough, Ben.

608
01:07:06,906 --> 01:07:11,343
In a fight, there's a chance
Jennifer might get hurt. I'm going.

609
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:15,471
He'll be sitting there
waiting to blow your head off. I know him.

610
01:07:15,548 --> 01:07:17,140
I'll take a chance.

611
01:07:55,921 --> 01:07:59,687
You fooled me, Warren.
I didn't think you'd have the guts to come.

612
01:07:59,792 --> 01:08:00,986
I'm here.

613
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,323
- You always liked deals, didn't you?
- What's yours?

614
01:08:04,396 --> 01:08:08,059
I'm surprised.
No questions about Miss Ballard?

615
01:08:08,467 --> 01:08:12,426
She's a delightful girl,
especially when you get to know her.

616
01:08:12,972 --> 01:08:14,803
All right, back off, Warren.

617
01:08:39,665 --> 01:08:42,930
- You got a deal to offer?
- I've got a deal.

618
01:08:43,002 --> 01:08:45,493
We make a trade. Jess for the girl.

619
01:08:45,604 --> 01:08:48,801
Do I shoot him or do you take care of that?

620
01:08:48,907 --> 01:08:52,001
Brazos, get back to your girl.
I won't need you.

621
01:08:56,115 --> 01:09:00,484
I made a mistake. I'm willing to admit it.
I didn't want him to hear it.

622
01:09:02,354 --> 01:09:05,084
When I started, it was just Jess and me.

623
01:09:05,491 --> 01:09:08,187
Now that he's not with me,
I know how much I need him.

624
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:11,696
To keep the men in line
and help me work at our plans.

625
01:09:12,031 --> 01:09:15,091
Without Jess,
I'm like a man with only one arm.

626
01:09:15,801 --> 01:09:18,235
- Is it a deal?
- That's up to Jess.

627
01:09:18,304 --> 01:09:21,068
No, it's up to you if you want your girl back.

628
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:22,869
You tried to kill him once.

629
01:09:22,941 --> 01:09:25,933
I offered to let him go. He was too stubborn.

630
01:09:26,345 --> 01:09:28,973
Why send for me? Why not Jess?

631
01:09:29,048 --> 01:09:31,141
I told you, he's too stubborn.

632
01:09:31,216 --> 01:09:33,810
That's one of the reasons I need him.

633
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,249
How do I get word to you?

634
01:09:36,322 --> 01:09:38,790
Build up your campfire
so we can see it from here...

635
01:09:38,857 --> 01:09:42,520
if it's a deal.
I'll bring your girl to you in the morning.

636
01:10:15,094 --> 01:10:18,063
You better decide, Jess.
You know him better than I do.

637
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:21,463
I thought I did, but he always crossed me.

638
01:10:21,533 --> 01:10:23,524
Then don't go.

639
01:10:23,602 --> 01:10:24,933
You think he's on the level?

640
01:10:25,003 --> 01:10:28,905
They had a gun on my back.
They could've used it if they wanted to.

641
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,637
Maybe he does need me.

642
01:10:32,711 --> 01:10:35,373
I kind of figured
he couldn't handle that crazy bunch.

643
01:10:35,447 --> 01:10:38,780
Jess, don't go if there's going to be
any trouble.

644
01:10:38,851 --> 01:10:42,343
They got a fortune down there
and part of it belongs to me.

645
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,353
To me, it's worth a chance.

646
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:09,947
You think Slayton talk straight?

647
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:12,176
It's a fifty-fifty chance.

648
01:11:12,484 --> 01:11:16,853
If it wasn't for Ben, I wouldn't be alive.
So I guess it's a fair gamble.

649
01:12:22,354 --> 01:12:23,878
Well, Jess...

650
01:12:25,724 --> 01:12:28,955
When you're out in California working hard,
remember old Jess.

651
01:12:29,027 --> 01:12:32,519
I'll be down in Mexico rolling in gold
and living like a king.

652
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:42,233
Goodbye, Miss Ballard.

653
01:13:03,061 --> 01:13:04,392
Did he bring anyone with him?

654
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:06,897
No, we came alone.

655
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:08,694
Good luck to you, miss.

656
01:13:34,393 --> 01:13:36,361
Johash, the horses.

657
01:13:36,461 --> 01:13:37,519
Ben, don't! Please!

658
01:13:37,596 --> 01:13:40,326
He killed Jess. You can't make deals
with men like Slayton.

659
01:13:40,399 --> 01:13:42,162
It took Jess' life to make me face it.

660
01:13:42,234 --> 01:13:45,328
But it's all over. You said so yourself.
We'll be home in a week.

661
01:13:45,404 --> 01:13:47,429
And leave Slayton to someone else?

662
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:49,872
Ben, we have a whole life ahead of us.

663
01:13:49,975 --> 01:13:53,467
If I walk away from this,
what will that lifetime be like?

664
01:13:54,713 --> 01:13:57,944
Ben, once you said
our ranch was the whole world for you.

665
01:13:58,083 --> 01:13:59,209
It is for me, too.

666
01:13:59,284 --> 01:14:01,377
I found out it isn't. It can't be.

667
01:14:01,453 --> 01:14:03,944
You end up losing everything
to men like Slayton!

668
01:14:10,162 --> 01:14:11,925
Ben, don't. Come back, Ben!

669
01:14:30,315 --> 01:14:33,807
It's our last stop before Mexico.
We better get some water.

670
01:14:34,519 --> 01:14:36,714
Blinky, I said you could bring
that bobcat along.

671
01:14:36,788 --> 01:14:39,552
Keep an eye on her.
She's yours, so watch her.

672
01:15:11,723 --> 01:15:13,384
How much further we gotta go?

673
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:16,655
Fifteen miles to the border.
We'll leave at sunup.

674
01:15:17,295 --> 01:15:19,229
You think I'll enjoy Mexico, Stella?

675
01:15:19,297 --> 01:15:21,128
Sooner or later I kill you.

676
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:22,996
Let's make it later.

677
01:15:25,504 --> 01:15:27,699
Westy, go see if there's any water
in that well.

678
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:29,206
There'd better be.

679
01:15:30,642 --> 01:15:33,202
Put enough in my bag
for me and the gal, now.

680
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:01,737
Johash, get around back.
You stay here and keep low.

681
01:16:46,718 --> 01:16:50,882
Here's your water, Slayton!
When you get thirsty, come out and get it!

682
01:16:56,561 --> 01:16:57,960
Out the back.

683
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:35,423
Get those saddlebags.

684
01:17:37,502 --> 01:17:40,403
Open it up, Jim. Open it.

685
01:17:43,441 --> 01:17:47,673
Warren! We got a friend of yours here.
We're coming out!

686
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:51,772
Raise your gun a half an inch
and we'll blow her head off!

687
01:18:08,333 --> 01:18:10,267
Kill him! Shoot him!

688
01:21:10,849 --> 01:21:13,909
You never learned how to use a gun,
did you, Warren?

689
01:21:13,985 --> 01:21:15,816
It's easy.

690
01:21:16,454 --> 01:21:18,718
All you do is pull the trigger.
