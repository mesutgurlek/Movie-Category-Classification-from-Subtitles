1
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,916
Somebody out there?

2
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,676
Who?

3
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,069
Who's out there? I got a gun by me.

4
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,912
That you, Medford?

5
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,390
- Who's that?
- Matt Weaver.

6
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,436
Weaver.

7
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,830
You stop right there, Weaver.
Don't you come no closer.

8
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,273
You crazy?

9
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,912
- What are you doing here?
- Doing? This is my farm.

10
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,591
No more, it ain't.

11
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,196
I'm warning you.

12
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,829
- This is my house.
- No more, it ain't.

13
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,072
- I bought it. From Sam Brewster.
- Brewster?

14
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,709
Yeah, Brewster.
After Grant mustered us out.

15
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,158
Why, this ain't been your house, Reb,
for pretty near three years.

16
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,631
Now, you start walking off my land
and keep off.

17
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,272
Welcome. Welcome home, Señor Matt.

18
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,878
Home? It's been stolen out from under me
by this thieving town.

19
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,839
My house is yours. A roof over your head.

20
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,195
I aim to sleep under my own roof.

21
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,558
- What's going on here, Billy?
- Matt Weaver.

22
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,789
Weaver?

23
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,917
He's got a gun.
He's heading for Brewster's.

24
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,470
Tuttle! Hey, Tuttle! Tuttle!

25
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,710
- What's the rumpus?
- The Reb is back.

26
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,633
- It's the Reb?
- Tuttle!

27
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,792
- Hey, Tuttle!
- Yes? What?

28
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,314
- Matt Weaver's here.
- Jumping Joseph!

29
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,552
Headed for Brewster's.
With a gun?! Wait for me!

30
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,871
- Crane, what is it?
- He's as big as life out there.

31
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,153
- Matt Weaver.
- What?

32
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,312
- I'll put a bullet through him.
- Crane, please.

33
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,630
And end my nightmare for good and all.

34
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,518
- Crane, you're drunk.
- Don't say it.

35
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,871
Don't you ever say it.

36
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,996
Oh, God!

37
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,189
Brewster! Open up, Brewster!

38
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,832
Brewster, open up!

39
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,756
Brewster!

40
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,596
Brewster, open up!

41
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,750
It's the Reb, sure enough,
pounding on Brewster's door.

42
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,796
- Let's hurry!
- Brewster!

43
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,156
Brewster, I'm coming in.

44
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,872
Come on down, Brewster,
or I'm coming up!

45
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,830
Weaver!

46
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,594
Stand clear!

47
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,875
Crane!

48
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,470
- Ruth.
- It's between me and him.

49
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,034
- You got him in the arm.
- I aimed for his Reb heart.

50
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,317
Your performance
is never up to your intentions.

51
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,676
Ruth, take Crane home.

52
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,873
Welcome, Sheriff, welcome.

53
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,750
Now that you're here,
is it in your capacity to arrest this man?

54
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,116
- He broke into my house, tried to kill me.
- Kill?

55
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,231
- I came here to ask about my farm.
- To ask?

56
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,874
Ask and it will be given thee,
but with a rifle in your hands...

57
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,916
Matt. Come on, Matt.

58
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,996
Sheriff.

59
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,915
Matt, get a hold of yourself.
Put Brewster out of your mind.

60
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,639
You're trying to take on a whole town,
not one man.

61
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,553
Old folks and womenfolks and Mexicans,

62
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,076
a couple of cripples like Crane,
that's what this town is.

63
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,553
But you come back on your own legs,
swinging your own arms,

64
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,870
seeing out of both your eyes.

65
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,956
Well, I found my daddy.

66
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,476
In Tennessee.

67
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,789
It was my daddy, all right,
but his head was shot off.

68
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,754
So, er... I picked up his rifle.

69
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,551
Picked up where he left off.

70
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,316
And I stayed to the end.

71
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,872
The end. Now it's over.
The war's over.

72
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,076
- Not here, it ain't.
- No, sir.

73
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,471
Not while Brewster can keep it going.

74
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,677
He said Medford bought my farm
from Brewster.

75
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,356
Well, how did Brewster get it?
How did Brewster get it?

76
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:30,470
When they auctioned it off, nobody
had any ready cash except for Brewster.

77
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,998
- Anted up just to keep things legal.
- Legal?

78
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,833
Legal? We was mustered out
to return home.

79
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,037
Articles of surrender
didn't mention confiscation.

80
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,669
Hey, boy, you just lost a pint of blood.
You quiet down.

81
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,797
So Brewster picked up my farm cheap,

82
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,075
sold at a profit to Medford?

83
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,150
Just widows and old folks dying off,
and who's picking up their leavings?

84
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,470
You get out of this town, boy.

85
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,871
Comes morning, you're still here,
pick up your gear and walk out of here.

86
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,076
Keep walking. Never come back.

87
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,075
- What's the holy racket?
- Church summons.

88
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,720
- On Tuesday morning?
- Funeral for John Medford.

89
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,837
Crazy Reb killed Medford
out at his farm last night.

90
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,396
This is the meetingest town.

91
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,913
- How long is the stop here?
- In Pecos, no longer than I can help.

92
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,434
Quarter-hour, maybe.

93
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,028
Our good reverend, Father McMichaels,

94
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,874
has given me leave
to speak a few words

95
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,157
over the body of my friend and yours.

96
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,991
A Union hero of Apache Canyon.

97
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,430
One of the few to return to us
from that valley of death.

98
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,995
May John Medford's soul rest in peace.

99
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,036
Amen.

100
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,239
Peace for John Medford,

101
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,350
but not for us, my friends, not yet.

102
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,596
This morning, we woke up to find
that we've got still another widow

103
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,831
in a town
that's already got more than its share,

104
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,753
and she was widowed
by a Reb, Matt Weaver.

105
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,037
No, the war is not over for us, friends.

106
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,076
This confederate soldier -

107
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,516
he's still in uniform, mind,
still bearing arms -

108
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,752
invaded this township,
broke into my house, broke out of jail,

109
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,796
if you believe our good sheriff.

110
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,032
And in the secret places
he did smite to death an innocent.

111
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,113
I put it to you,
how do we smite this enemy of the Lord?

112
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,158
Now, listen here. You listen here to me.

113
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,195
I brung the first wagons in.

114
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,919
I can bring this rebel boy in to stand trial.

115
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,992
I got to bring him in.

116
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,471
We're not forgetting what you done
when you was able, you old warhorse.

117
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,120
We won't send you out
to get cut down by a crazy Reb.

118
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,873
Suppose you tell us
what you're working us up to.

119
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,751
Lacking a posse
or a sheriff able to do the job,

120
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,515
come to me, we could call on
the US Marshal in Santa Fe for help.

121
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,958
Except the US Marshal's got a territory
full of looters and Rebs to clean up.

122
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,793
They got a backlog a year long.

123
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,192
But we can't wait a year. We can't wait
a week. Business will go to pot.

124
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,035
How many more
can Matt Weaver widow in a year?

125
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,193
I hear you, Mr McKeever,
so I'm digging into my own pocket.

126
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,272
I sent Crane Adams to Amarillo
to hire a lawman

127
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,238
able to flush that Reb out of these hills

128
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,153
and end this war we thought was over.

129
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,031
A lawman, Mr Brewster?
Crane went to find a gunfighter.

130
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,318
A gunfighter kills the man he goes after.
No trial, no jury.

131
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,356
Guilty or innocent, he kills him.

132
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,274
- Are you asking us to believe...?
- I'm asking you nothing, Mrs Adams.

133
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,715
Women don't vote here.

134
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,237
You turning this funeral service
into a meeting, Sam?

135
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,993
Well, I've got a vote.

136
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,278
And I'm asking you, are you saying
we're not gonna hear Matt's side of it?

137
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,794
Dispense with
the whole due process of law?

138
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,351
How many here besides me lost sons?
Hands! Hands!

139
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,433
How many here lost husbands? Hands!

140
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,637
Due process of law, Barker, in wartime?

141
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,032
Until every last murdering Reb
lays down his arms, it's still war,

142
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,033
and we got a new widow in our midst
that needs our help.

143
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,193
Stint not, brother. Stint not. Give.

144
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:51,434
Give and it shall be given unto you.

145
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,796
All aboard!

146
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,109
You paid through to Santa Fe.

147
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,155
Found you a little life, huh?

148
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,356
Don't look for it to last.

149
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,796
Giddup!

150
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,473
How did it go?

151
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,916
Medford's gone for good
and Weaver's good as gone.

152
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,956
I'll take over.

153
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,190
You sure you want this side of town?

154
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,158
Mexican town's just over the wash.

155
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,876
You'll be a sight more comfortable here.

156
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,838
Billy, take Mr...

157
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,878
Take the gentleman's bags
up to number five, front.

158
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,712
Staying long, Mr...?

159
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,994
You knew I'd open for that signal.

160
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,392
Well, who's out there? Crane? Who else?

161
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,516
Nobody's out there.

162
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,429
I came here to find out for myself.

163
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,631
Did you kill John Medford?

164
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,550
Well, I went crazy.

165
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,594
I tried to scare him off with bullets.

166
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,557
Well, old Medford come out
with his hands up.

167
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,392
To talk, he said.

168
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,598
No guns, he said, so I put down mine.
He got close and pulled this.

169
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,196
He missed and I didn't.

170
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,390
Ruth, I swear that's what happened.

171
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,352
If I believed you, what difference would
it make? The whole town is after you.

172
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,396
I know.

173
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,434
Five weeks walking here, Ruth.

174
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,149
And now I get here and...

175
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,592
Ruth, I'm tore up.

176
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,830
Not just Medford.

177
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,593
You and Crane, how could you marry?

178
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,836
If you ever came back,

179
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,549
I wanted to be sure
that I wouldn't be waiting for you.

180
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,757
Well, you fixed it sure, all right.

181
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:04,631
You never believed that I cared that much
about men buying and selling other men.

182
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,676
You wouldn't let yourself care.

183
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,878
You didn't love me enough to stop doing
the one thing that could finish us for good.

184
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,555
- I told you I had to go find my daddy!
- That is not why you went!

185
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,473
You went because
you're pigheaded like your father.

186
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,348
Because you couldn't do like the rest
if it killed you.

187
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,956
Matt.

188
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,198
Yell at me again. It feels real homelike.

189
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,194
You were such a mean, stubborn boy,
it was the only way I could make you listen.

190
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,919
I used to wonder if you'd ever grow up.

191
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,550
And you never did. Hold that.

192
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,793
I grew up, but you're right,
I never was much on reasonableness.

193
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,670
And having my farm stole out from me
doesn't make me any more so.

194
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,830
You never were
and you never will be.

195
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,876
I'm glad I didn't wait for you.

196
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,076
Are you happy with Crane?

197
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,356
Crane left town yesterday.

198
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,556
He went...

199
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,596
He went to find a gunfighter.

200
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,195
Gunfighter? To fight what?

201
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,236
To fight you.

202
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,676
Brewster.

203
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,150
It'll take Crane a week.

204
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,959
If you leave now, they'll never find you.

205
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,079
That's my mother's grave out there, Ruth.

206
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,597
I planted them vines on the porch.
I live here till I die.

207
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,435
Sooner or later, however long I live,
I'll fight the town for the right to die here.

208
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,196
Now you answer me.

209
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,676
You happy?

210
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,956
Happy?

211
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,114
This is the house
I was going to live in until I died.

212
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,035
You planted vines.
I knew where I was going to plant roses.

213
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,758
I loved you.

214
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,313
I loved you so much
that now I hate you

215
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,470
because you're a thief, Matt.

216
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,791
You stole yourself away from me
for nothing.

217
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,030
For nothing.

218
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,873
You stole my rightful life away from me.

219
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,669
I got a half-dollar
says he's a skinny runt tied to a big gun.

220
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,230
Them skinny runts get handy with a gun.
They got to, you know.

221
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,029
Wait here. I'll go find Brewster.

222
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,236
Dancer.

223
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,350
Let me through.
Let me through, please.

224
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,273
Mr Brewster, this is Mr Dancer.

225
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,112
Good morning, sir.

226
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,079
You one-armed toad! Drag me 100 miles
in that hearse for what?

227
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,516
For nothing!
Your brain's rotten with booze.

228
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,435
- Mr Brewster...
- Can't you do nothing right?

229
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,432
I sent you after a gunfighter.
What did you come back with?

230
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,476
How do you find a gunfighter?

231
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,710
You don't go to church.

232
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,791
You go to a saloon.

233
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,793
Saloon keeper says the top gun
is a fella by the name of Jewel,

234
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,793
but he had to move on
and now we're using Dancer,

235
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,678
so I tell Dancer we're paying $300...

236
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,799
And you pay his coach fare here,
and where is he now?

237
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,314
Here. He's here. Jewel.

238
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,516
- Where?
- There.

239
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,113
- Your name Jewel?
- No.

240
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,872
The hotel register.

241
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,513
My name is...

242
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,717
Jules...

243
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,676
Gaspard...

244
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,715
D'Estaing.

245
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,353
Jules... soft J, silent S.

246
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,911
Gaspard... silent D.

247
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,468
D'Estaing... just a touch of diphthong.

248
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,710
Touch of diphthong?

249
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,759
Well, try Jules.

250
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,351
Jewel.

251
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,238
That J is still a little hard.

252
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,437
- Try this. Zzh.
- Zzh.

253
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:08,116
No. I'm just gonna call you,
if I need you, Jewel.

254
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,878
Step along to my office now. I'll find out
soon enough if I'm gonna need you.

255
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,473
How many steps?

256
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,870
Right down the street here to the bank.

257
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,916
The bank... where the money's kept.

258
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,389
Too hot.

259
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,676
You a gunfighter?

260
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,473
We got a little problem round here.

261
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,633
It's quite a story. Quite a story.

262
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,109
- There's this Reb...
- Where?

263
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,350
On this farm he owns.

264
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,472
Just a short ride out of town.

265
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,028
Horseback ride?

266
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,190
I stay off horses.

267
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,353
Well, I guess you could walk it.

268
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,115
I'm not much for walking, either.

269
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,909
I'll take care of your Reb. $500.

270
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,431
I am not Dancer.

271
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,476
I will take his $300 on account.

272
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,995
Now.

273
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,072
There... in your breast pocket.

274
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,155
The banker's sweating.

275
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,198
My hotel room's cooler.

276
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,436
After the time you've wasted for us,

277
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,195
you'd better pray
this Jewel's what they say he is

278
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,840
and does what he says he'll do.

279
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,957
That's two things I'm settling right now.

280
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,996
- I'm back.
- I put your coffee on your desk.

281
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,235
What I want to hear
is how you're going to earn your money.

282
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,029
- With a bullet in his back, no doubt.
- In his...

283
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,709
What I am talking about
is you're here, and he's out there.

284
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,791
Now, you won't ride.
You won't walk.

285
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,836
He will have to come to me.

286
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,195
He can't work a farm under siege.

287
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,589
He's been shooting his food.

288
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,275
Every sunup
we hear his rifle cracking away.

289
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,874
Weaver's always been a dead shot.

290
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,951
Not with an empty rifle.

291
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,358
Now, where would a man
buy or steal bullets in this town?

292
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,590
The emporium.

293
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,717
Suppose I'm tired of this hotel room,

294
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,998
and the emporium might seem
more... homelike.

295
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:04,108
Not hardly. The Adamses live upstairs.
Crane might, but Ruth...

296
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,749
The way you walked into my room,
I'd say you owned the hotel.

297
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,469
Wouldn't surprise me if you owned
a piece of every business in this town.

298
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:18,229
I own more than a piece
of the emporium. I can tell you that.

299
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,917
So you see, I have more faith
in your powers of persuasion than you do.

300
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,479
I'll put it to Crane. If a man
know not how to rule his own house...

301
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,516
Is he a man?

302
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,511
Yes, sir.

303
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,673
Catch Weaver red-handed stealing.

304
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,548
That is a cut above a bullet in the back,
you got to admit.

305
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,555
Hear you held a town meeting
the other day. How did they vote?

306
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,196
Who?

307
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,512
- Mexicans?
- Don't vote.

308
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,556
Live here.

309
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,551
Around about. They go their way,
we go ours. Two separate towns, like.

310
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,393
- And farmers?
- Work our farms if they want to eat.

311
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,313
- Don't eat much.
- Don't need much. They're different.

312
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,630
I can see
how you could afford to go Union.

313
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,429
We went Union
because we're against sedition and slavery.

314
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,829
And sin.

315
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,593
All but one die-hard Reb.

316
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,990
Well... let's close him out.

317
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:26,309
- Ruth! Mrs Adams, this is Mr Jewel.
- Yes.

318
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,868
Well, Crane,
I brought you some business, boy.

319
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,633
A bit out of your line, maybe.
I got a boarder for you.

320
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:37,397
A boarder, for a couple of days.
Mr Jewel don't fancy the hotel much.

321
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,517
- We don't take in boarders.
- First time for everything.

322
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,310
- We don't take in boarders. Ruth!
- I'm putting it to you.

323
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,109
- What's Ruth got to do with it?
- The work.

324
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,749
A woman's work is never done
in a boarding house, I'm sure.

325
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:58,915
I've been meaning to take a long look
at these books of yours, first chance I got.

326
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:19,111
Crane, boy, you can't afford
not to take a boarder.

327
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,556
You'll find Mrs Adams here
sets a nice table.

328
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,475
You heard. You'll be doing the work.
If you don't want him here, speak up!

329
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,552
- Well, that's all settled.
- Yes.

330
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,995
- I'll be on my way now.
- If you'll show me the way.

331
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,796
Certainly.

332
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,311
Oh. A spare room. Means room to spare.

333
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,830
- It was never a question of room.
- Yes, just the company.

334
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,875
I do hope you don't find me
too troublesome.

335
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,673
And what if I do?

336
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,918
Isn't it easier to keep an eye on me here
than from your front steps?

337
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,952
It's Crane's.

338
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,349
He... played beautifully.

339
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,593
Sleep well, my child

340
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,998
Silvery dreams be thine

341
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,519
May happiness

342
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,556
Illume your way

343
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,229
Comme dans chaque vie

344
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,954
Bien qu'il soit tôt ou tard

345
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,948
On dit qu'il faux qu'il tombe
un peu de pluie

346
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,510
French! That was French.

347
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,910
- You French?
- Creole.

348
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,070
Creole?

349
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,913
New Orleans?

350
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,468
Born in New Orleans?

351
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,716
It's funny.

352
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,756
Don't you see the joke?

353
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,755
Joke's on Brewster.
We hired a Reb to kill a Reb!

354
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,673
Born in New Orleans, but no Reb.

355
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,716
- Union?
- No.

356
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,030
Well, now...

357
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,310
Let's just hear how you managed that.

358
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,188
- Managed to be in Mexico.
- Sat it out. Slacker, eh?

359
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,914
Reb or slacker,
which makes you feel better?

360
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,313
Nothing can make me
feel better about you. Put nothing past you.

361
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,392
Know what I think?
I think you're lying straight through.

362
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,790
- Creole? I say you're Mexican.
- Crane.

363
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,437
I'll tell you what I am and what you are.

364
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,389
I am a man with a gun, and you're drunk.

365
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,436
Please go.

366
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,916
Good night.

367
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,389
Deuces wild.

368
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,758
I'll open with a dollar.

369
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,149
- I call.
- I'm out.

370
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,754
A dollar... and raise you 15.

371
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,233
I'm out.

372
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,996
- Call.
- Out.

373
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,715
Light.

374
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,835
Cards?

375
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,391
Two.

376
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,354
One.

377
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,158
One for the dealer.

378
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,078
I bet 25.

379
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,035
Out.

380
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,832
25...

381
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,639
and 25 better.

382
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,196
I call you, dammit.

383
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,559
Beat four aces!

384
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,958
Five kings.

385
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,474
Show 'em!

386
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,433
Four kings... and a deuce.

387
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,796
No deuce.

388
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,910
- Five kings.
- You...

389
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,957
What? What's this?

390
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,554
Never dealt a hand like that before.

391
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,992
Never seen such a town.

392
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,116
Nobody challenges the deal.

393
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,833
Brewster's trained you.

394
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,036
Mr Tuttle will collect for me.

395
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,109
I'll come by for my money tomorrow.

396
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,269
Your own hired hand, and you're
letting him thieve you and walk away.

397
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,920
Jewel! We hired your gun.

398
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,958
Might favour us
with a sharpshooting exhibition.

399
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,315
Tomorrow, maybe?

400
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:40,434
Fancy shooting exhibition
tomorrow night. Bring your friends.

401
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,913
Crane?

402
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,035
Don't tell me
the boarder made it home first.

403
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,838
I heard shots. They woke me.

404
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,749
Just a little gunplay in the saloon.
Nobody hurt.

405
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,400
Gunplay?

406
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,436
Guns are playthings to you?

407
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,516
Play and work, Mrs Adams.

408
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,756
Work and play.

409
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,591
Tell me something. The truth.

410
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,556
I never lie.

411
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,836
I...

412
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,440
I have this feeling that you...

413
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,034
that you are playing with us, all of us.

414
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,076
And...

415
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,318
that you really don't intend to do
what you've been paid to do.

416
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,233
Is that a question or a request?

417
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,596
I'm not sure.

418
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,636
Maybe both.

419
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,156
First smile.

420
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,835
First in a long time.

421
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,709
Much longer since I've laughed.

422
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,268
My mother used to scold me
for laughing too much.

423
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,316
Is that why you stopped?

424
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,394
My mother died, and my father.

425
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,639
When the war reached us here,
I don't know, one day I stopped laughing.

426
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,676
You were not born here.

427
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,716
New England.

428
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,995
In a white town in a green valley.

429
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,516
I wish we'd never left.

430
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,558
This came from New England
with Crane's family.

431
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,996
Nothing good
comes from the savage South.

432
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,390
I'm not one of those Northerners
who despises the whole South.

433
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,436
We knew a family here that...

434
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,636
Well, a Southern family.

435
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,508
They were wonderful people.
Warm, kind, happy.

436
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,470
Your second smile.

437
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,596
You didn't answer my question.

438
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,349
Will I do what I have been paid to do?

439
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,714
What would I gain by answering it?

440
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,997
Well, your second smile
was your last for a while.

441
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,310
I'll answer your question.

442
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,153
I'm in business for money.
And pleasure, too.

443
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,994
A town that hires a gunfighter is always
a henhouse with just one rooster,

444
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,833
a few fat capons,
a few clipped wings.

445
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,480
What happens
when a man with a gun walks in?

446
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,358
That's play, Mrs Adams. Fun!

447
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,149
When the fun is over, I'll pull the trigger.

448
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,516
Where does Crane go at night?
Why does he drink?

449
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,830
What is Matt Weaver to Crane?

450
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,876
What is he to you?

451
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,029
Tell me.

452
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,718
Was Crane a whole man
before he lost his arm?

453
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,357
Are you a whole woman?

454
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,672
- Always this hot in Pecos?
- Hm?

455
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,392
Hot? Oh, it'll get much hotter
before it cools off... in winter.

456
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,914
We have snow in winter.

457
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,993
Mr Guthrie used to say
it's either burn or freeze in Pecos.

458
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,514
The late Mr Guthrie.

459
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,231
Are those fresh flowers?

460
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,914
Oh. Yes. They're from my garden.

461
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,676
May I?

462
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,916
Thank you.

463
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:20,274
- I want to buy a horse, Mr Kenarsie.
- Buy?

464
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,557
Recollect you saying something
about staying off horses.

465
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,198
Until I have to get on one.

466
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,590
Keep it here and saddled up
for the next 24 hours.

467
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,831
I hear you. Knew we could look
for a little action soon.

468
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,276
Well, er... Let's see what we got here. Ah.

469
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,430
Here's a goodie. Yes, sirree.

470
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,636
Here, boy.

471
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,910
There's a steal. $30.

472
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:56,393
Who is stealing from whom? Four hours'
ride and this horse will go lame.

473
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,712
You got a pretty good feel
for a horse-shy city fella.

474
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,996
Let's see. What else we got here?

475
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,072
You've got nothing here but that.

476
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,116
No. That sorrel ain't for sale.

477
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,509
I nursed him up from a colt.
Ride him myself.

478
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,716
I wouldn't sell him for gold.

479
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:21,390
- $30 in currency.
- No. I wouldn't sell him.

480
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,438
I can't allow you to cheat yourself,
Mr Kenarsie.

481
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,875
$30 when I take him out.

482
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,036
He's worth 200.

483
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,236
30.

484
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:38,359
Now saddle him up and keep him saddled.

485
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,633
Matt! Señor Matt!

486
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,389
Cornmeal. Un pollo.

487
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,198
And news.

488
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,158
Gunfighter in town.

489
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,554
He's due, don't worry.

490
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,871
But I do, amigo. I have seen him.

491
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,635
Today he bought a horse
that he will use before tomorrow night.

492
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,113
Yeah, well...
I'm ready and waiting for him.

493
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,910
If you got it to spare, thank you kindly.

494
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:40,234
But this... You can't spare that.

495
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,952
- I can shoot mine.
- True.

496
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,759
To us they will not sell shot.

497
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,596
Shave, one dime.

498
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,153
I admire your enterprise.

499
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,438
The war shorted me on customers,
in a manner of speaking.

500
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,876
I had to do something
to make ends meet.

501
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,916
Show me that.

502
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:55,989
I'm showing that on consignment
for one of our local widows.

503
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,390
Husband didn't make it back.

504
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,955
Bargain at $50.

505
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,838
I'll take it.
I'll pay Mrs Guthrie when I see her.

506
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:13,311
Well, now, I didn't say Mrs...
No, sirree. I don't do business...

507
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,153
You can't...
What am I going to tell Mrs Guthrie?

508
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,196
I'll tell her.

509
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:24,352
My motto is eliminate the middleman
by hook or crook.

510
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:17,709
Señor, a usted le han pagado para que
mate a Matt Weaver.

511
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,349
Señor, you will kill Matt Weaver?

512
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,590
Señor, why does it interest you?

513
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:39,317
He is the only man here
who treats us like men.

514
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,550
Matt Weaver and his father before him.

515
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,074
The Reb?

516
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,396
People aren't simple, are they?

517
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,313
Yes, I've been hired
to kill Matt Weaver.

518
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,394
Save your breath
and tell them they've been wasting theirs.

519
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,473
If only a man with a gun can solve
their problems, I'm not the man.

520
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,516
I'm not even interested.

521
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,959
You have time to kill me and get away.

522
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,909
Cover up for a thief? I won't do it.

523
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,036
Oh, Matt.

524
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,554
If these bullets keep me alive,
I'll pay you back.

525
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,752
Say what you mean.
Say you're ready to keep on killing.

526
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:32,355
I told you, Ruth,
I'll fight to keep what's mine.

527
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,995
I'm ready for your gunfighter now,
so you just send him after me.

528
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:44,039
Is that the way you came in?
Well, leave that way now.

529
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:49,232
Ruth, I never thanked you for coming out
to warn me. I do thank you, Ruth.

530
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,715
- Hurry, Matt.
- Ruth...

531
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,712
I'm saying goodbye.

532
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,950
Only way I know.

533
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,514
I love you and I'm sorry I'm like I am.

534
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,956
Don't you cover up...

535
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,313
May I join you?

536
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,239
- Who's he?
- I board here.

537
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,474
No, sir. You're the gunfighter.

538
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,996
- A gunfighter without a gun.
- You're taking quite a chance.

539
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,231
I passed up my chance of killing you.

540
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:46,598
I wanted to look you over, ask a question.

541
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,470
Look quick. I killed so many men these
past four years, one more don't matter.

542
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:55,030
You passed up your chance.
You think I'm gonna pass up mine?

543
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,270
Truce for tonight.

544
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,715
Then you believe them
when they say I'm crazy?

545
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,552
So am I, but it's a funny thing.

546
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,313
A man crazy to live
takes a chance and dies.

547
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,632
A man who doesn't care takes
the same chance and gets away with it.

548
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,234
Let's call it Jules Gaspard's Law.

549
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,994
All right. All right.

550
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:18,868
So far you're getting away with it.
Now, about that question.

551
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,918
Why were you the one Reb
in a Union town?

552
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,716
What kind of a question...

553
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:32,591
Well, I used to have a reason.
Lots of them.

554
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,796
Was it to defend your...

555
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,189
let's call it your slave-owning rights.

556
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,431
Slave-owning rights? Slave-owning?

557
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,988
Whoever seen a slave in these parts?
You, Ruth?

558
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,594
Only my pa and me
slaving away for Brewster.

559
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,716
Paying off loans for seed and stock.

560
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,156
Took longer to pay off the interest
than the loans.

561
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,798
I know.

562
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,714
I know it's a poor, mean excuse
of a reason to carry arms.

563
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,112
Sometimes...

564
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,510
Sometimes it seems like to me
I went Reb just to cross Brewster.

565
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,158
Don't believe him.

566
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,630
He's what he is because
he can't do anything like anybody else,

567
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:11,429
and because he hates this town
as much as you do.

568
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,195
You both hate this town
and you've let it set you against each other.

569
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:19,635
You think you've found a way to get me
not to do what I've been paid to do.

570
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,111
Have I?

571
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,317
If I were human. I'm not, I'm told.

572
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,155
You don't want to be. I believe that you are.

573
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,232
I say you're gonna try
to earn your blood money.

574
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,276
Right.

575
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,999
You stand between me
and something I want.

576
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:43,073
Mm-hm. When the time comes,
it'll help to know you aren't human.

577
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,229
Ruth!

578
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,590
Where are you? Ruth!

579
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,432
You stopped me.

580
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,036
Couldn't have you claiming my $500.

581
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,759
- You let him get away.
- My aim was off.

582
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,910
I don't see you hotfooting after him.

583
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,230
I'm tired. Your wife caught him stealing.

584
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,392
I mistakenly came to her rescue
without my gun.

585
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,597
- We'll make a fresh start tomorrow.
- Sure.

586
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,234
Good night.

587
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,152
- You caught him stealing?
- Yes.

588
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,708
- Or arranged it?
- No.

589
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:58,270
Or maybe set up a truce parley
between him and the gunfighter?

590
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,590
Sober up before you accuse me.

591
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,958
What did you promise the gunfighter
to let Matt go?

592
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:09,552
Oh. I saw Mr Adams.
Then I saw you through the...

593
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,790
It's early, but I thought you might be...

594
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,189
- You're not open?
- We just opened.

595
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:18,193
If Mrs Adams isn't about yet,
I can just come back a little later.

596
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,999
What did you have in mind?

597
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,878
Just some thread. So it can wait.

598
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:30,956
Mrs Guthrie, do you know that I am now
the proud possessor of this?

599
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,956
That isn't why I came here.

600
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,235
Don't think that's why I came here.

601
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,788
Are you willing to part with it to me?

602
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:43,549
I must part with it...
if you're sure you want it.

603
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,596
I want it.

604
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,150
Now, what did Mr Fiddler
say it was worth?

605
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:54,189
He said...
He thought I might get $25 for it.

606
01:00:56,040 --> 01:01:01,512
Now, 50's the price Mr Fiddler quoted
and what it's worth to me.

607
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,876
I can't allow you to...

608
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:09,954
Now, Mrs Guthrie,
don't you think you owe yourself...

609
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,917
a new dress?

610
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,554
I haven't had a new dress since...

611
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,830
Well, it's been a long time.

612
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,910
Silk.

613
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,956
Or maybe something gay.

614
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,192
I really can't decide.

615
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,193
I'm afraid of losing all control
with my new-found riches.

616
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,840
I'll have to think it over
and come back later.

617
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,115
- Thread.
- Yes.

618
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,589
Thread. I do need some thread.

619
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,636
It's white.

620
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,352
- Thank you for opening for me.
- There you are, Ruth.

621
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,149
Good morning, Hannah. One spool
of thread. That's 12 cents, please.

622
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:01,119
It's a lovely morning, isn't it? Just lovely.

623
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:09,355
I pray that the watch
will be worth $50 to you.

624
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:14,560
Mrs Guthrie, if one dollar of it
finds its way into Mr Fiddler's pocket,

625
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,030
I promise you I'll smash the watch.

626
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,236
Yes. You...

627
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,196
Here you are.

628
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,317
I think I'll buy enough material
to make a bonnet to match.

629
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,353
You don't keep a record
of 12-cent sales?

630
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,759
What are you?

631
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,990
You know all you need to know.

632
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,117
A hired killer.
How could you choose such a life?

633
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,909
Choose?
Why did you marry Crane Adams?

634
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:16,558
Shall I help? You both loved music.

635
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,757
He lost his arm
in the holy war to free the slaves,

636
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,796
lost music with his arm.

637
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,950
So you made it up to him,

638
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,429
hating slavery as you do.

639
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,272
If you do.

640
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,316
Because I've never seen it?

641
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,356
Can't you hate an idea? I hated it.

642
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:35,273
- And loved Crane for hating it too?
- Wanted to.

643
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,793
You're forgetting
I was born in New Orleans,

644
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,348
where we see things differently.

645
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:47,639
- Black men are born to be slaves.
- You can't believe that.

646
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:51,633
- Because all men are born equal?
- They should be.

647
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:55,679
Now, you wanted to know
how I turned gunfighter.

648
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,555
Well, my father educated me

649
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:04,077
beyond what the New Orleanians
would call my station in life.

650
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,798
- I don't understand.
- You don't?

651
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,270
My mother asked my father
to improve my position.

652
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:15,033
He refused.

653
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,872
She kept asking.

654
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:19,916
It annoyed him.

655
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,956
So he sold her.

656
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:32,190
You see, we could say
that Crane lost his arm to free me.

657
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,272
To free me for what?

658
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,396
That is the question, Mrs Adams.

659
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,556
Have you lost your voice?

660
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,156
Don't look like that.

661
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:53,158
It's not what you've just told me, it's...

662
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,595
- It's what it's made of you.
- No.

663
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:00,070
There was a wide choice
for the son of a quadroon slave.

664
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,116
Piano player in a fancy house,

665
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,033
back-room gladiator
for white gentlemen betters.

666
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,991
But your name,
that beautiful French name.

667
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,753
Oh, yes. My father's name.

668
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,876
I'm covering it with glory.

669
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,439
You pity him?

670
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,032
I pity his son.

671
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,549
Save your pity for Matt Weaver.
He's dying tonight.

672
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,156
Please.

673
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,515
Last night you let him live.

674
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:37,469
Today you're going to kill him
because of something I've said or done?

675
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:40,199
There's something I want from you.
It's not pity.

676
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,516
Leave your husband

677
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,034
and this hellhole of a town

678
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,076
with me.

679
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,673
Think about it.

680
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,229
Will you kill Matt Weaver, señor?

681
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,630
Señor, I am not here to talk.

682
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,834
I am here on very important business.

683
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,070
Do not kill Matt Weaver.

684
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,956
I've been paid to kill him,

685
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,390
I swore to kill him

686
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,996
and I want to kill him.

687
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,948
Then why do you drink in the morning?

688
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,836
Don't worry about the Reb.

689
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,276
His skin is white.

690
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:59,393
If the white town finds out they need him,

691
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,031
they'll find a way of getting to him.

692
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,554
No. Never.

693
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,153
Soon.

694
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,390
If I am wrong,

695
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,199
if he lets himself be used,

696
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,635
I will load your gun for you.

697
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,759
Stand by, señor. Stand by.

698
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,753
I guess you didn't hear Crane Adams.

699
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:27,515
Jewel let Matt Weaver
fly free as a bird last night.

700
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,670
Shot at him and missed.

701
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,193
Fine gunfighter.

702
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:36,159
He's a dead shot. He done it on purpose.
He's from New Orleans.

703
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,630
Mr Brewster, he's a Reb, just like Matt.

704
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,314
You all had your say now?

705
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,918
All right.

706
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,675
I want to do whatever's right
and best for us all.

707
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:52,639
Whosoever would be chief among you,
let him be your servant.

708
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,037
So, let's hear the will of this meeting.

709
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:03,590
- Get rid of the gunfighter.
- Now.

710
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:14,158
So be it.

711
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,310
I'm elected to do the talking, am I?

712
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,152
Then you all bear me witness
I do it right.

713
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,955
Today we vary your diet.

714
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,436
There.

715
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,236
God in heaven.

716
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:17,033
- Going to the hotel.
- Yeah.

717
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,429
Going past it now.

718
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,232
Fiddler's locked his door.

719
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,349
Like a dog in a garbage heap.

720
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,838
Yes. A mad dog.

721
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,638
What's he doing?

722
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,150
Stop him!

723
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,476
Talk, or I will.

724
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,116
Jewel...

725
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:28,436
I'd like to have a word with you.

726
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:30,875
Well, here I am.

727
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:34,916
I...

728
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:38,230
I'd like...

729
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:42,033
a few words in private, Jewel.

730
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:46,590
- A few words here.
- All right.

731
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,913
Kneel.

732
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,233
On your knees, Mr Brewster.

733
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,512
Rooster ruler of the roost.

734
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:04,720
Get on your knees.

735
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,318
Repeat after me.

736
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,320
Don't face me, face this miserable animal.

737
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,635
He's doing it.

738
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,633
Now... repeat after me.

739
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,760
"I am a thief and a hypocrite

740
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,151
"and I beg forgiveness

741
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:56,749
"for all the filth
I've burdened you with

742
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:59,912
"in this dirtiest of towns

743
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,912
"on the dirty face of the earth. "

744
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,516
Say it.

745
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,636
Matt!

746
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,676
Matt Weaver!

747
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,633
- Don't move, doc.
- I won't.

748
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:35,032
But Brewster's coming in to parley.
We got trouble, Matt.

749
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:49,757
Crane's dead. The sheriff's dead drunk.

750
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:52,752
- Ruth?
- All right last I saw her.

751
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,592
Gunfighter's gone on a rampage.

752
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:57,797
He smashed up the whole town.
Everybody's hid out.

753
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:59,233
What you want?

754
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:03,029
I'm going to give you the satisfaction
of hearing that from Brewster.

755
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,076
That much you got coming.

756
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:11,035
Deed to your farm
signed back to you by Mrs Medford.

757
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,395
She told me
how Medford got himself killed.

758
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,436
How long you known that?

759
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,080
Let's just call this paper a peace treaty.

760
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,156
War's over.

761
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,629
What you want from me
for my own farm?

762
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,676
Your help.

763
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:33,188
Why, don't look so sad
when you make a joke.

764
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,874
- No joke.
- Funniest I ever heard.

765
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:39,635
You bribing me to kill a gunfighter
you hired to kill me.

766
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:45,594
- I'm laughing fit to kill.
- You're right, Matt.

767
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:48,478
You got no use for me
and I got none for you.

768
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,597
But fair is fair.
I was wrong about Medford.

769
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,432
I was wrong to hire the gunfighter.

770
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,557
I just pray you're a better shot than him.

771
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:02,716
You think you can pray me
into being one of your fool hired hands?

772
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,756
The town's full of them.

773
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:09,038
You can do it and you're gonna do it,
so let's stop talking about it. I know.

774
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,796
You know what?

775
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,074
Ruth.

776
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:20,757
Ruth and the gunfighter alone in
the emporium ever since Crane was killed.

777
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:24,549
And she went back
of her own free will. I saw.

778
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:30,033
Today Crane stopped fretting about you.
Tried to kill the gunfighter.

779
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:32,156
I got a notion how come he tried.

780
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:37,717
- Go on.
- Oh, Matt.

781
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:42,032
Now, we all know Ruth's still got
a soft spot in her heart for you.

782
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:49,151
I got this notion she promised
the gunfighter something... Let you go.

783
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,156
Crane couldn't stand that.

784
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,515
He said I stood between him
and something he wanted.

785
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:07,358
Well, anyway, they been alone there
together in the emporium this past hour.

786
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,676
We brung a horse for you.

787
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,718
You've changed your mind.

788
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,828
It was changed for me.

789
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:39,275
Crane's dead. I'm half-dead.

790
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:42,432
If my going with you
will save one whole life...

791
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:45,835
Is that the whole reason?

792
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,876
I wish it were.

793
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:56,876
But the truth is
part of me wants to come with you.

794
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,030
And you know that.

795
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,638
I warn you.

796
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:07,188
It won't keep me alive very long.

797
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,915
You said you never lie,

798
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,151
so I've believed
everything you told me.

799
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:17,196
You said you'd kill Matt.

800
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:20,076
You said you aren't human.

801
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:26,510
I told you I'd been told that all my life.

802
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,876
It didn't have to be true.

803
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,110
But now you've believed it.

804
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,191
And now it's true.

805
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:43,195
I give you two lives for the one I took.

806
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,594
Yours...

807
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:49,353
and Matt Weaver's.

808
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,476
Because what I feel for you

809
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:05,479
might turn out to be the opposite of hate.

810
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,796
I can't risk that.

811
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:24,912
I'm going in.

812
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:27,514
There.

813
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:55,990
Hombres con pistolas... y Matt Weaver.

814
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,991
Gracias.

815
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,116
- Looking for me?
- No.

816
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:17,069
- You going somewheres?
- Yes.

817
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,670
Without earning your blood money?

818
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:24,474
Which reminds me.

819
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,916
The blood money.

820
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,829
You might use it in my name,

821
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:37,549
say for the emancipation
of the local slaves...

822
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:40,995
Reb.

823
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,640
I'm standing between you
and something you want?

824
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:47,474
You're standing between me
and the road out of town.

825
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:51,599
Well, if it wasn't the money,
what do you want? What did you get?

826
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:57,710
Neither profit nor pleasure.

827
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:01,950
You can't make me draw on you.

828
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,956
Stop trying, boy.

829
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,876
Matt!

830
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,916
Let him go.

831
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,432
Why is he going?

832
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,594
What did you give him to let me off?

833
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,438
Nothing.

834
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:31,239
Not true.

835
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,677
Cuidado!

836
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,193
Oh, God.

837
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,595
Brewster.

838
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,475
Throw the gun.

839
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:11,678
Get on your knees.

840
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,714
This time say it.

841
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:24,109
Don't face me.

842
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,270
Face this mule of a Reb.

843
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:40,510
Say after me...

844
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,710
"I am a thief

845
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,109
"and a liar. "

846
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,395
I am a thief

847
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,914
and a liar.

848
01:25:53,000 --> 01:26:00,429
Say, "Forgive me
for betraying you and this town,

849
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,391
"this town that I now...

850
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,351
"bequeath to your care. "

851
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,476
Say it.

852
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,716
Say it.

853
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:48,113
We did it.

854
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,191
No, you did it, Brewster.

855
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:54,190
You turned me into one of them.

856
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,672
Now finish it.

857
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:01,718
Say, "Forgive me
for betraying this town. "

858
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,633
It's a Reb talking. I warned you.

859
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:08,395
I warned you. That's a Reb taking over!

860
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,436
- Say it!
- Stop him!

861
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,511
- Stop him!
- Say it!

862
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,511
We just took a vote, Sam. You heard it.

863
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:20,150
He'll walk this town like he owns it!

864
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,355
Ruth, I...

865
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:21,757
Hear as how you just won the war, Reb.

866
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:49,755
