60
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:04,834

THE DAMN TENT OVER.

A POWERFUL TEMPER.

62
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,634
THAT HARDWARE COCKSUCKER'S
BEEN AN ONGOING PAIN IN MY BALLS

63
00:05:15,634 --> 00:05:17,734
SINCE HIM AND HIS PARTNER
SHOWED UP.

64
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,267
WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE
THAT HEATHEN'S HEAD

65
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:22,634
GOT TO THEM TUFTS OF HAIR
CAME OFF OF, AL?

66
00:05:22,634 --> 00:05:24,000
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,334
DIDN'T SOME MEXICAN BRING
THE HEAD IN FOR BOUNTY?

68
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:29,767
IF IT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU, I'LL
LOOK IT UP IN MY YESTERDAY'S DIARY.

69
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:32,100
COULDN'T MATTER LESS.

70

AS FAR AS
THE TRIAL ITSELF,

71

I GOT NO PROBLEM
ACTING AS HOST.

72

LOSS OF REVENUES
NOT WITHSTANDING.

73
00:05:37,968 --> 00:05:40,000
WELL, I'M HAPPY
TO HAVE IT AT MY JOINT,

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,133

OUT OF PLACE.

00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:47,601
ANYWAYS,
WE'LL HAVE IT HERE.

77
00:05:49,868 --> 00:05:52,601
BUT JUST LET ME SAY
THIS ONCE IN YOUR HEARING.

78
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:54,868
FOR OUT-RIGHT STUPIDITY,

79
00:05:54,868 --> 00:05:58,300
THE WHOLE FUCKING TRIAL CONCEPT
GOES SHOULDER TO SHOULDER

80

WITH CUSTER'S THINKING WHEN
HE HEADED FOR THAT RIDGE.

81
00:06:00,968 --> 00:06:02,934
IT'S GOT
ITS DISADVANTAGES.

82
00:06:02,934 --> 00:06:05,501
WE'RE ILLEGAL.

83
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:09,801
OUR WHOLE GOAL IS TO GET
ANNEXED TO THE UNITED STATES.

84

WE START
HOLDING TRIALS,

85
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:14,334
WHAT'S TO KEEP THE UNITED

86
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:15,934
"OH EXCUSE US,
WE DIDN'T REALIZE

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,634
WONDERFUL.
ONE LOAD OFF YOUR BACK.

154
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,968
LET ME SEE ABOUT
GETTING YOU THAT CRIPPLE.

155
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:07,534
IS HE DEAD OR ALIVE?

156
00:10:07,534 --> 00:10:09,033
HE'S SICK.

157
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:11,067
AND WE AIN'T
NO HOSPITAL!

158
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:17,634
NUMBER EIGHT'S
RELOCATING.

159
00:10:17,634 --> 00:10:21,734
BUNDLE HIM UP, PUT SOME
OF LEON'S REMEDY DOWN HIM

160
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:23,400
AND TAKE HIM
TO THE HILLS.

161
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,601
CAN SOMEONE ELSE DO IT,
MR. TOLLIVER?

162
00:10:26,968 --> 00:10:28,734
SURE THEY CAN.

163
00:10:29,934 --> 00:10:32,067
SHALL I GET SOMEONE
ELSE TO TAKE HIM?

164
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:38,133
NO, I'LL DO IT.

165
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:40,033
AND BURN THE BLANKET
AFTERWARDS.

166
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:42,767
THANKS, BART.

167
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,968
SOME DO GET WELL, CY.

168
00:10:46,968 --> 00:10:48,801
HIS CHANCES WILL
IMPROVE OUTDOORS.

169
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:51,133
THE BRACING AIR.

170
00:10:57,267 --> 00:10:59,467
WHAT ARE YOU MOVING
THE TABLES FOR?

171
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:01,501
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
THE JURY RIGHT HERE.

172
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:03,834
CAN'T THEY SIT
AT SEPARATE TABLES?

173
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:06,167
DO YOU WANT THE TABLES
TOGETHER, OR NOT?

174
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:09,334
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING DONE
THAT CAN'T BE UNDONE

175
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:12,434
FIVE MINUTES AFTER
THIS FIASCO CONCLUDES.

176
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:15,801
CLEAN SOMEWHERE
WHERE I CAN'T SEE YOU.

177
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:20,801
GO ON,
GET FUCKING!

178
00:11:20,801 --> 00:11:23,100
HAVE PATIENCE
WITH THE WIDOW, AL.

179
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,267
SHE'S GIVE HER PROXY
TO THAT HARDWARE FELLA.

180
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,667
HICKOK BREAKS MY BALLS
FROM THE AFTERLIFE.

181
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,834
YOU FEEL,
BEFORE HE WAS MURDERED,

182
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:33,167
HICKOK ENLISTED BULLOCK
IN THE WIDOW'S CAUSE?

183
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:35,767
ADVANCE THE SUBJECT
OR PICK UP A BROOM.

184
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:38,701
SIGNING A PROXY DON'T MEAN
THE WIDOW CAN'T DO A DEAL.

185
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:40,534
<i>IT JUST INCLUDES BULLOCK IN.</i>

186
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,334
IF THE WIDOW TRUSTS
HER OWN JUDGMENT,

187
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,667
SHE DON'T LET HICKOK BRING THE
HARDWARE COCKSUCKER INTO IT.

188
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:47,267
SHE'S TRYING
TO GET OFF THE DOPE.

189
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:49,000
MAYBE LOADED

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,767
SHE'D GET HER
SELF-CONFIDENCE BACK.

191
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:53,701
LET ME CAMP BENEATH
HER WINDOW AND SUGGEST THAT.

192
00:11:53,701 --> 00:11:57,300
HICKOK'S HALF-WOMAN FRIEND'S
OFF SOMEWHERES ON A TEAR.

193
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,801
THE ORPHAN SQUAREHEAD'S
IN THE WIDOW'S CARE.

194
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:02,100
THE WIDOW FEELS
PUT UPON.

195
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,934
SHE'S ASKED ME
TO FIND HER SOME HELP.

196
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:06,234
I SUGGESTED THE GIMP.

197
00:12:06,234 --> 00:12:07,501
NO!

198
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:10,667
SO AS NOT TO PUT
A WHORE UP FIRST OFF.

199
00:12:11,734 --> 00:12:14,634
NOW, I WILL
PROPOSE TRIXIE.

200
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,067
AS A GET ACQUAINTED GIFT,

201
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:20,834
SHE COULD BRING THE WIDOW
A GOOD-SIZED BALL OF DOPE.

202
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:22,467
YES.

203
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:24,367
WELL THOUGHT
THROUGH, E.B.

204
00:12:28,734 --> 00:12:30,667
TELL THE WIDOW
YOU HAVE A CANDIDATE.

205
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:34,701
<i>I HAVE TO GO
LOOK TO MY ROAST.</i>

206
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:39,067
MY COOK'S ON THE QUEUE
TO SEE HICKOK'S REMAINS.

207
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:41,300
<i>THEN HE'LL PROBABLY
SNEAK HERE FOR THE TRIAL.</i>

208
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,934
( shatters )

209
00:12:46,234 --> 00:12:48,167
OOPS.

210
00:12:53,834 --> 00:12:55,334
<i>Seth:
REVEREND.</i>

211
00:12:55,334 --> 00:12:57,901
UH, SIR.

212
00:12:57,901 --> 00:12:59,667
SIR, WHO STANDS
FOR MR. HICKOK?

213
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:02,901
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- MR. UTTER HAS GONE TO CHEYENNE.

214
00:13:02,901 --> 00:13:05,300
AND I DON'T FIND
MR. HICKOK'S WOMAN FRIEND.

215
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,133
<i>MR. NUTTALL
COMMISSIONED THE COFFIN,</i>

216
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:09,267
<i>BUT WISHES NOT
TO PARTICIPATE FURTHER.</i>

217
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:11,534
<i>NOW I NEED GUIDANCE
IN CERTAIN MATTERS.</i>

218
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:13,467
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHO STANDS FOR HIM.

219
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:15,734
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO FIND OUT?

220
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:19,133
FOR EXAMPLE, I THOUGHT
"HOW FIRM A FOUNDATION."

221
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,934
FOR THE HYMN.

222
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:25,334
SOUNDS A GOOD CHOICE.

223
00:13:25,334 --> 00:13:27,167
- DO YOU THINK SO?
- YES, I DO.

224
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,501
- MIGHT SOMETHING ELSE BE MORE APPROPRIATE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

225
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:31,934
<i>I THINK "HOW FIRM
A FOUNDATION"</i>

226
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:33,567
FOR THE HYMN
AND FROM THE GOSPEL,

227
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,701
- FIRST CORINTHIANS 12.
- ALL RIGHT.

228
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:39,167
"IF THE FOOT SHALL SAY
BECAUSE I AM NOT THE HAND,

229
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,634
I'M NOT OF THE BODY, IS IT
THEREFORE NOT OF THE BODY?

230
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:44,534
AND IF THE EAR SHALL SAY
BECAUSE I'M NOT THE EYE

231
00:13:44,534 --> 00:13:47,501
I'M NOT OF THE BODY,
IS IT THEREFORE NOT?

232
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:51,734
NOW HATH GOD SET THE
MEMBERS, EVERYONE OF THEM,

233
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:54,467
IN THE BODY AS IT
HATH PLEASED HIM."

234
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:57,400
THAT IS A GOOD CHOICE,
REVEREND.

235
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,033
12 AND 13, I THINK.

236
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:11,801
ARE WE OPEN
FOR BUSINESS?

237
00:14:34,934 --> 00:14:36,667
( squealing )

238
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:47,367
- I KNOW YOU.
- I KNOW YOU, TOO.

239
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:50,467
AFTER BUMRUSHIN' ME OUTTA YOUR
FINE HARDWARE ESTABLISHMENT,

240
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:52,467
YOU DIDN'T SEE
THIS COMIN', DID YOU?

241
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:54,968
I HALFWAY DID,
YOU DROOP-EYED COCKSUCKER!

242
00:14:54,968 --> 00:14:56,634
I WAS BORN DROOP-EYED,
ALL RIGHT?

243
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:59,033
AND WHO DO YOU BLAME
FOR THE REST OF THE MESS?

244
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:01,167
LET ME ASK YOU THIS,
COCKSUCKER,

245
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:04,300
YOU THINK THEY KNOW ME
IN NEW YORK CITY BY NOW?

246
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,701
- ( groans )
- IF YOU WASN'T TIED UP I WOULD KILL YA!

247
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:09,901
OW, WHAT ARE YOU
CRYIN' FOR?

248
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:12,601
- WHAT?
- I'M ASKIN' WHAT YOU'RE CRYIN' FOR?

249
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:15,601
DID YOU LOVE
HICKOK SO MUCH?

250
00:15:15,601 --> 00:15:17,200
WAS YOU SWEETHEARTS?

251
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,734
DID HE STICK
HIS DICK UP YOUR ASS?

252
00:15:19,734 --> 00:15:21,934
( groaning )

253
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:23,801
<i>Man:
HEY, HEY!</i>

254
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:25,400
I'M THIS MAN'S COUNSEL.

255
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:28,701
( gasping )

256
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:33,200
THEY WILL PIN
A ROSE ON YOU.

257
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,901
BOY, I'LL SHAKE
YOUR HAND.

258
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:41,300
I'M ALL TRUSSED UP
LIKE A CHRISTMAS PIG.

259
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,734
I WOULD SAY YOU'RE BETTER
SITUATED THAN YOUR COMPANIONS.

260
00:15:47,868 --> 00:15:50,567
WELL, I'M A HARD CASE
FOR YOU, COUNSELOR.

261
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:52,968
AND NO MISTAKE,

262
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:55,767
EVERYONE IN THERE
SAW ME SHOOT HIM.

263
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:58,400
IF YOU'LL LET ME
SET OUR STRATEGY,

264
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,767
I DON'T THINK WE'LL
DISPUTE WHAT PEOPLE SAW.

265
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:04,267
NOW, I GUESS YOU'RE
HERE TO BREAK ME OUT.

266
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:06,133

267
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,000
SON, DID
JAMES BUTLER HICKOK

268
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,601
EVER KILL
A RELATIVE OF YOURS?

269
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:13,467
JAMES BUTLER HICKOK?

270
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:15,000
WILD BILL HICKOK.

271
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
DID HE EVER KILL A BROTHER
OF YOURS OR THE LIKE?

272
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,634
- A BROTHER?
- I'M ASKING YOU

273
00:16:21,634 --> 00:16:24,000
IF WHAT HAPPENED
IN THAT SALOON

274
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,801
WAS VENGEANCE FOR THE
DEATH OF A FAMILY MEMBER.

275
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:32,033
POSSIBLY A BROTHER
IN ABILENE,

276
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,868
OR THE LIKE.

277
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,400
A BROTHER IN ABILENE.

278
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:40,367

279
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:54,534
<i>OH, CHRIST.</i>

00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:05,334
OH, JESUS.

( rasping )

282
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:10,033
YOU ALL RIGHT?

283
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:12,834
( gasping )

284
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:15,868
LOOK, I'M SORRY AS HELL
ABOUT ALL THIS.

285
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,901
<i>SORRY AS HELL.</i>

<i>I'M NOT GONNA BURN THE
FUCKING BLANKET. FUCK CY!</i>

287
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:26,834
LOOK, THIS IS NOT
MY FUCKING FAULT.

288
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:29,934
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

289
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:40,501
AH, CHRIST.

290
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:48,367
AH, GOD TAKE ME!

291
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,634
WHAT DO YOU
LOOK AT OUT THERE?

292
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:02,767
WHATEVER I CAN SEE.

293
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:05,067
CLEAN UP.

294
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:07,200
AM I ON JURY DUTY?

295
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,567
PUT ON A DECENT ENOUGH DRESS
TO HELP A WIDOW WITH A KID.

296
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:14,234
WHAT WIDOW IN CAMP
HAS A KID?

297
00:18:14,234 --> 00:18:17,033
THE WIDOW IS THE NEW YORK
DUDE'S WIDOW.

298
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:19,267
THE KID IS THE ORPHAN
SQUAREHEAD.

299
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:22,501
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS
CARING FOR THAT CHILD NOW.

300
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,400
DOES IT CHANGE WHAT
FUCKING DRESS YOU WEAR?

301
00:18:27,934 --> 00:18:29,334
NO.

302
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:31,033
WIDOW'S A DOPE FIEND.

303
00:18:31,033 --> 00:18:32,767
SHE'S BEEN
DRINKING IT.

304
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:38,033
HELP HER EXPAND
HER HORIZONS.

305
00:18:57,901 --> 00:19:01,133
I SEE NO GUARD
OUTSIDE OF ROOM EIGHT.

306
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:04,167
YEAH, ROOM EIGHT LEFT.

307
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:05,667
BORNE BY ANGELS?

308
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:08,133
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT MAN
TO WORRY ABOUT ANYMORE.

309
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:09,834
YOU OR ME EITHER.
JUST...

310
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:12,400
PUT THE MAN IN ROOM EIGHT
FROM YOUR MIND.

311
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,434
I HAVE NO VACCINE

312
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:18,234
FOR THE SICKNESS THE MAN
IN ROOM EIGHT DIDN'T HAVE.

313
00:19:18,234 --> 00:19:20,934
THE CLOSEST
PLACE THAT DOES,

314
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:23,367
TO MY KNOWLEDGE,
IS FORT KEARNEY.

315
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:25,267
IF YOU WANT TO REMEDY

316
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:28,667
THE EPIDEMIC THAT YOU HAVE NO
REASON TO BELIEVE WILL BREAK OUT,

317
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,601
I WOULD SEND SOMEBODY
THERE RIGHT AWAY.

318
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:34,000
HEARD YOU LOUD
AND CLEAR, DOCTOR.

319
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,801
WILL YOU SEND SOMEONE,
MR. TOLLIVER?

320
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:38,567
IF I DO, YOU'LL BE
THE FIRST TO KNOW.

321
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:42,734
IF YOU DON'T,
AND I HAVE TO,

322
00:19:42,734 --> 00:19:46,100
THAT WILL BE KNOWN TO EVERY
DAMN PERSON IN THIS CAMP!

323
00:19:56,234 --> 00:19:57,834
JOEY?

324
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:09,067
YOU EVER HAD
NEBRASKA PUSSY?

325
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:11,400
NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE,
MR. TOLLIVER.

326
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,434
EDDIE SAWYER,
GET IN HERE!

327
00:20:16,601 --> 00:20:18,734
TRUE OR NOT, EDDIE,

328
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:21,868
WHEN A MAN WETS HIS END
IN NEBRASKA PUSSY,

329
00:20:21,868 --> 00:20:23,767
HIS LIFE IS
CHANGED FOREVER.

330
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:25,467
SPEAKING ONLY
FOR MYSELF,

331
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:27,934
I STILL MARK
THE ANNIVERSARY.

332
00:20:27,934 --> 00:20:30,901
WELL, POINT ME
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

333
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:32,968
( laughs )
YOU HEAR THAT, EDDIE?

334
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:34,601
BOY'S GOT
A HEALTHY ATTITUDE.

335
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,968
( chuckling )

336
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:38,567
YES, SIR?

337
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:40,400
COME HERE.

338
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,534
GET THIS OUTTA HERE.

339
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:49,367
GET RID OF IT?

340
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:52,601
DID YOU HEAR ME ANNOUNCE
THE OTHER NIGHT

341
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:55,067
THAT I'D PAY A $50 BOUNTY
FOR EVERY INDIAN HEAD?

342
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:58,334
- I WAS RIGHT NEXT TO YOU, AL.
- THAT'S THE FIRST HEAD.

343
00:20:58,334 --> 00:21:01,267
SOME CHILI CHOMPER'S
OUT THERE SOMEWHERE

344
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:02,801
RIGHT NOW SPENDING
MY $50.

345
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:04,901
YOU GET RID OF THAT HEAD,
OR YOU'D BETTER KNOW

346
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:07,000
OF ANOTHER PLACE WITH
A POSITION OPEN FOR AN IDIOT.

347
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,367
ALL RIGHT.

348
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:12,734
GOT A COUPLE PLACES
I CAN KEEP IT, I GUESS.

349
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:14,601
YEAH, TILL AFTER
THE TRIAL.

350
00:21:14,601 --> 00:21:17,000
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
DO WITH IT THEN?

351
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,300
PUT IT SOMEWHERE
IN THE BAR?

352
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,267
IT'S A NICE
CONVERSATION PIECE.

353
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,801
I MEAN IF IT'S HANDLED
THE RIGHT WAY.

354
00:21:31,868 --> 00:21:35,133
YOU HAVE BEEN TESTED,
AL SWEARENGEN.

355

AND YOUR DEEPEST
PURPOSES PROVED

356
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,968
THERE'S GOLD
ON THE WOMAN'S CLAIM.

357
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:44,634
YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE
SHOUTED IT FROM THE ROOFTOPS.

358
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,300
"THAT'S WHY I'M JUMPING
THROUGH HOOPS TO GET IT BACK.

359
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,834
THOROUGH AS I FLEECED
THE FOOL SHE MARRIED,

360
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:57,367
I WILL FLEECE

EUSTACE BAILEY FARNUM
AS MY GO-BETWEENS AND DUPES.

363

TO EXPLAIN
WHY I WANT HER BOUGHT OUT

364
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:13,300
I WILL MAKE A PRETEXT OF
MY FEAR OF THE PINKERTONS.

365
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,467
I WILL THROW FARNUM
A TOKEN THIEF.

366
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:20,701
WHY SHOULD
I REWARD E.B.

367
00:22:20,701 --> 00:22:23,400
WITH SOME
SMALL FRACTIONAL

A LITTLE SECURITY

INCOME FOR HIS DECLINING YEARS?

371
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,701
WHAT'S HE EVER
DONE FOR ME?

372
00:22:36,701 --> 00:22:39,167
EXCEPT LET ME
TERRIFY HIM

EVERY GODDAMNED DAY

NO NONSENSE.

A MAN OF REPUTATION
WAS KILLED IN THIS CAMP.

NOW THE KILLER
HAD NO REPUTATION.

399
00:24:18,601 --> 00:24:21,634

SPEAK BADLY ENOUGH

THE KILLER IS A COWARD,

SHOOTING WILD BILL HICKOK

410
00:24:55,334 --> 00:24:59,567

WHY'D YOU KILL
HICKOK, MR. McCALL?

415
00:25:14,868 --> 00:25:17,234
HE MURDERED
MY BROTHER IN KANSAS.

<i>- ( men laughing )
- I SAID WHEN?</i>

425

I DON'T RECALL

430
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:01,934
<i>NO, WHEN THE SHOOTING
HAPPENED, NO.</i>

AIN'T YOU PRETTY?

462
00:27:31,934 --> 00:27:34,434
I'M SORRY ABOUT
YOUR HUSBAND, MA'AM.

463
00:27:36,534 --> 00:27:38,968
IT'S GOOD OF YOU
TO CARE FOR THE CHILD.

464
00:27:40,968 --> 00:27:43,634
I WAS UNDER THE
IMPRESSION YOU WERE HURT.

465
00:27:43,634 --> 00:27:44,934
MA'AM?

466
00:27:44,934 --> 00:27:47,734
MR. FARNUM SAID
YOU HAD SOME SORT OF

467
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:49,567
PHYSICAL LIABILITY?

468
00:27:51,067 --> 00:27:54,067
I'M NOT HER. SHE'S
LOVELY, THOUGH, JEWEL.

469
00:27:55,934 --> 00:27:58,167
MAY I WASH HER?
GIVE HER A NICE BATH?

470
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:00,133
OF COURSE.

471
00:28:00,133 --> 00:28:02,133
ALL RIGHT,
LITTLE ONE.

472
00:28:12,767 --> 00:28:14,834
SHE DOESN'T
SPEAK ENGLISH.

473
00:28:16,734 --> 00:28:18,400
I'M TRIXIE.

474
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,534
TRIXIE.

475
00:28:28,801 --> 00:28:30,667
YOU WANT A BLOWJOB
WHILE I TALK TO YOU?

476
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,767
NO.

477
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:35,033
I WASN'T OFFERING IT
PERSONALLY.

478
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:36,767
MAKE YOUR POINT.

479
00:28:36,767 --> 00:28:39,467
MY POINT IS...

480
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,434
BEFORE A GUILTY VERDICT

481
00:28:41,434 --> 00:28:43,334
WOULD GET EXECUTED
ON THAT COCKSUCKER,

482
00:28:43,334 --> 00:28:46,400
THREE MEN WOULD
WALK IN THAT MEAT LOCKER

483
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,667
WHERE HE'S BEING HELD
WITH BAGS OVER THEIR HEADS

484
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:50,200
AND CUT HIS THROAT.

485
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,868
WITHIN HALF AN HOUR THOSE
CELESTIAL LITTLE PIGS WILL BE

486
00:28:52,868 --> 00:28:54,901
ON THEIR BACKS
WITH THEIR HOOVES IN THE AIR

487
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:56,434
BELCHING UP
HUMAN REMAINS.

488
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:59,200
ARE YOU SAYING YOU'D
ORDER THAT TO BE DONE?

489
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,934
I'M SAYING
I HAD A VISION

490
00:29:02,934 --> 00:29:04,968
IT WOULD HAPPEN.

491
00:29:04,968 --> 00:29:07,067
MY SECOND OF THE DAY.

492
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:09,067
FIRST COME WHEN
I WAS WATCHING YOU

493
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:10,934
AND THEM LAWYERS
ON LINE THIS MORNING.

494
00:29:10,934 --> 00:29:15,567
THEY BEGAN TO SLITHER
IN MY SIGHT LIKE VIPERS.

495
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:17,868
SO AS NOT TO PUKE
I HAD TO CLOSE MY EYES.

496
00:29:17,868 --> 00:29:19,767
THE VISION WENT ON.

497
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:22,767
GOT WORSE.

498
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:24,834
I SAW THE VIPERS IN
THE BIG NEST IN WASHINGTON.

499
00:29:24,834 --> 00:29:26,467
THEY WERE TAKING US
IN THE CAMP

500
00:29:26,467 --> 00:29:30,067
FOR ACTING LIKE WE COULD SET
OUR OWN LAWS UP OR ORGANIZATIONS.

501
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:32,701
AND THEN I SAW THE BIG VIPER
DECIDE TO STRANGLE

502
00:29:32,701 --> 00:29:35,701
AND SWALLOW US UP AND EVERY
FUCKING THING WE GAIN HERE.

503
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:37,067
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

504
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:39,901
HOW COULD WE
FUCKING AVOID IT?

505
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:42,467
HOW COULD WE LET THE VIPERS
IN THE BIG NEST KNOW

506
00:29:42,467 --> 00:29:44,734
THAT WE DIDN'T WANNA CAUSE
ANY FUCKING TROUBLE?

507
00:29:44,734 --> 00:29:46,767
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU
HAD YOUR SECOND VISION?

508
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:48,801
YEAH, THE CUTTHROATS
AND THE PIGS.

509
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:50,968
BUT WHO WANTS ALL THAT
BLOOD SPILLED, JUDGE?

510
00:29:50,968 --> 00:29:53,667
ISN'T THERE A SIMPLER WAY

511
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,901
OF NOT PISSING OFF
THE BIG VIPERS?

512
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,934
I WANT TO GET BACK
TO THE TRIAL.

513
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:07,434
GO AHEAD.

514
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,567
<i>( door opening, closing )</i>

515
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:22,434
HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE
THE TRIAL'S GOING?

516
00:30:22,434 --> 00:30:26,033
- I DON'T KNOW.
- SHOULD'VE TOOK HIM INTO THE TERRITORY.

517
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:28,501
HANG 'EM HERE, THEY'LL BE
OPENING A CAN A WORMS.

518
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:31,501
<i>GUESS IT'S ALL
A CAN A WORMS.</i>

519
00:30:31,501 --> 00:30:33,400
NOW YOU'RE TALKING.

520
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:36,067
WILL YOU HELP ME
WITH THE BODY?

521
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:40,400
( chattering )

522
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
GOOD TALK?

523
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,133
WE'LL SEE.

524
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,400
MM.

525
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,334
YOU SEE THAT ONE?

526
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:49,334
HIM, THAT ONE THERE
IN THE MIDDLE.

527
00:30:49,334 --> 00:30:51,133
- THE CURLY HAIR?
- YEAH, YEAH.

528
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:54,367
TOLD ME THE OTHER NIGHT HOW
BAD HICKOK NEEDED KILLING.

529
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:55,834
YEAH.

530
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:58,434
SAID HICKOK INSULTED HIM
IN THE STREET.

531
00:30:58,434 --> 00:31:00,767
HOPE HE'S GOT
A FORCEFUL PERSONALITY.

532
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:05,033
WE'RE BACK
IN SESSION.

533
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:09,901
THIS CAMP IS PART OF NO
TERRITORY, STATE OR NATION.

534
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:12,901
STARS AND STRIPES
MAY FLY HERE SOON,

535
00:31:12,901 --> 00:31:15,033
BUT THAT DAY
IS NOT HERE YET.

536
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:17,634
YOU OF THE JURY THEREFORE
ARE WITHOUT THE LAW

537
00:31:17,634 --> 00:31:19,601
UPON WHICH
TO DECIDE THIS CASE.

538
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:22,501
<i>AND HOW THEN
ARE YOU TO DECIDE IT?</i>

539
00:31:22,501 --> 00:31:26,133
<i>YOU MUST RELY
ON COMMON CUSTOM.</i>

540
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:28,467
THAT McCALL KILLED HICKOK
IS NOT IN DISPUTE.

541
00:31:28,467 --> 00:31:30,434
<i>HE SAYS HE WAS
TAKING REVENGE,</i>

542
00:31:30,434 --> 00:31:32,133
<i>THAT HICKOK
MURDERED HIS BROTHER.</i>

543
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:36,334
IF YOU BELIEVE WHAT
HE SAYS TO BE TRUE

544
00:31:36,334 --> 00:31:40,367
CUSTOM DICTATES
THAT YOU EXCUSE HIM.

545
00:31:41,868 --> 00:31:44,601
THE JURY WILL NOW RETIRE
TO THE WHORES' ROOMS

546
00:31:44,601 --> 00:31:46,934
<i>AND BEGIN THEIR
DELIBERATIONS.</i>

547
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:54,033
- SUPPOSE ELLSWORTH'S WITH US?
- OH YEAH, FOUR SQUARE.

548
00:32:05,601 --> 00:32:07,567
OPEN THE BAR.

549
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:10,501
GET THE GIRLS FUCKING
TILL THE JURY COMES BACK.

550
00:32:10,501 --> 00:32:12,767
<i>THE DOWNSTAIRS ROOMS
IS OCCUPIED.</i>

551
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:14,901
UPSTAIRS AIN'T.

552
00:32:14,901 --> 00:32:16,400
TRUE.

553
00:32:24,834 --> 00:32:26,434
<i>Andy:
STRIKE ME DEAD.</i>

554
00:32:26,434 --> 00:32:30,067
<i>I APOLOGIZE.</i>

555
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:33,367
<i>PLEASE,
I HURT SO MUCH NOW.</i>

556
00:32:42,334 --> 00:32:45,100
YOU'RE ONE SICK
FUCKING CUSTOMER.

557
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,934
I APOLOGIZE.

558
00:32:47,934 --> 00:32:49,801
DON'T APOLOGIZE
TO ME.

559
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,400
I DON'T EVEN
FUCKING KNOW YA!

560
00:32:52,801 --> 00:32:54,434
YOU WANT A DRINK
OF WHISKEY?

561
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:57,167
AND NO LIPPIN'
THE BOTTLE,

562
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:59,300
BUT I GOT A PRETTY
STEADY POURING HAND.

563
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,267
I APOLOGIZE.

564
00:33:01,267 --> 00:33:03,334
ACCEPTED.
OPEN YOUR YAP!

565
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,667
HEY!

566
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:08,267
OPEN UP!

567
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,968
MORE FOR ME
ANYHOW.

568
00:33:18,934 --> 00:33:20,801
I APOLOGIZE.

569
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:25,801
HEY.

570
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:28,100
MY BEST FRIEND DIED.

571
00:33:29,701 --> 00:33:33,400
THE MAN I HAD MY BEST
FRIEND-FEELING ABOUT IN THE WORLD.

572
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,300
TOOK YOU AS HE FOUND YOU,

573
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,601
THOUGHT THE BEST OF YOU.

574
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:40,701
SWEET TO ME!

575
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:42,767
I APOLOGIZE.

576
00:33:49,767 --> 00:33:54,000
MAYBE YOU WOULD
RATHER HAVE SOME WATER?

577
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,367
I WILL GO GET SOME
FROM THE CREEK.

578
00:34:00,033 --> 00:34:02,033
BUT IF YOU DON'T
STOP 'POLOGIZING,

579
00:34:02,033 --> 00:34:04,000
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU
A GODDAMN DROP.

580
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,133
ALL RIGHT, MISTER?!

581
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:10,133
I'M COMING BACK
WITH SOME WATER.

582
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:17,067
I APOLOGIZE.

583
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:19,100
SHUT THE FUCK UP!

584
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,100
LOOK HOW PRETTY
YOU ARE.

585
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,067
PRETTY GIRL.

586
00:34:26,434 --> 00:34:28,734
ARE YOU POORLY?

587
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,200
CRAMPY?

588
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,367
YES.

589
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:35,300
DOES LAUDANUM HELP?

590
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,834
IT USED TO.

591
00:34:38,234 --> 00:34:40,601
IT DOESN'T ANYMORE.

592
00:34:40,601 --> 00:34:43,367
ARE YOU AFRAID?

593
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,567
YES.

594
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:49,100
I WAS AWFUL AFRAID
WHEN I WAS STOPPING.

595
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,267
<i>FIRST I WAS AFRAID
I WAS GONNA DIE.</i>

596
00:34:52,267 --> 00:34:54,133
<i>AND THEN I WAS
AFRAID I WOULDN'T.</i>

597
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:57,167
AND THEN ONE DAY
I WOKE UP...

598
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:59,234
FREE.

599
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:07,501
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I DIDN'T THINK TO PUT HER

600
00:35:07,501 --> 00:35:09,434
IN ONE OF MY CAMISOLES.

601
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,000
NO, BUT YOU LOOK HOW
PRETTY SHE LOOKS IN IT.

602
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,200
LOOK AT HER.

603
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,767
MAY I CONFIDE?

604
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:29,534
CERTAINLY.

605
00:35:29,534 --> 00:35:31,968
I'VE NEVER BEEN
LAID IN NEBRASKA.

606
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,667
WE ALL OF US
SOMETIMES EMBELLISH.

607
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:37,400
I FEEL UNBURDENED.

608
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,968
HAPPY TO HELP.

609
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:42,801
WHAT DID YOU
SEND HIM TO GET?

610
00:35:42,801 --> 00:35:45,300
IF I HAVEN'T
SAID YET, EDDIE,

611
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,901
YOU THINK ASKING'S
GONNA MAKE ME?

612
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:55,133
LOOK AT THE LADY.

613
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:57,801
IT'S QUIET, I THOUGHT
I WOULD SEE HICKOK BURIED.

614
00:35:57,801 --> 00:35:59,133
SURE.

615
00:35:59,133 --> 00:36:01,667
SURE, WHAT?

616
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:03,501
SURE, JOANIE,
GO AHEAD.

617
00:36:03,501 --> 00:36:07,000
OR WAS YOUR POINT YOU
WEREN'T ASKING PERMISSION?

618
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,067
CONSCIENCE STRUCK.

619
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:18,834
NEEDS TO SING A HYMN.

620
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:20,868
SHE LIKED ANDY.

621
00:36:20,868 --> 00:36:23,133
I DID TOO.

622
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:12,033
- ( knocking )
- DOC?

623
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:14,267
I'M IN THE BACK!

624
00:37:14,267 --> 00:37:16,200
WELL, I WON'T
TROUBLE NOTHING.

625
00:37:18,234 --> 00:37:20,200
- HI, DOC.
- WHAT IS IT?

626
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,634
COUPLE YEARS AGO
I TOOK POWDERS.

627
00:37:23,634 --> 00:37:25,567
GETTING SOME
AWFUL CRAMPING.

628
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:28,968
- I WISH I KNEW WHAT WAS IN 'EM.
- THAT'D BE HELPFUL.

629
00:37:28,968 --> 00:37:31,934
BROWNISH LIKE.

630
00:37:31,934 --> 00:37:33,834
I PUT 'EM
IN MY TEA.

631
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,367
WELL, IF IT'S THE MONTHLY'S,
I GENERALLY PRESCIBE

632
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:38,434
A DAY OR TWO OF LAUDANUM
AGAINST THE CRAMPS.

633
00:37:38,434 --> 00:37:40,667
COMING OFF THE LAUDANUM'S
WHAT HAD ME CRAMPY.

634
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:44,734
THEN YOU USED IT FOR
MORE THAN A FEW DAYS.

635
00:37:44,734 --> 00:37:46,634
LITTLE LONGER, YEAH.

636
00:37:46,634 --> 00:37:48,934
BETWEEN 12 AND...

637
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:51,801
HOWEVER OLD I WAS
THREE YEARS AGO.

638
00:37:51,801 --> 00:37:53,801
HAVE YOU TAKEN 'EM
BACK UP AGAIN?

639
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:56,601
IT'S THE RICH WOMAN
WANTS TO STOP.

640
00:37:56,601 --> 00:37:59,501
- THE WIDOW.
- AND WHAT'S THAT TO YOU?

641
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:01,767
OR TO YOU
WHY I BE INTERESTED?

642
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,467
I WON'T SWEAR

643
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:12,400
THIS IS YOUR
SOVEREIGN REMEDY.

644
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,167
BUT THE COLOR
WILL BE RIGHT.

645
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,934
AND IT SHOULD
GIVE HER SOME RELIEF.

646
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,267
THANKS, DOC.

647
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:31,400
IT'S A LITTLE ENOUGH
TO DO WITH WHAT'S COMING.

648
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,868
WHAT WOULD THAT BE?

649
00:38:33,868 --> 00:38:35,901
AND WHAT WOULD
THAT BE TO YOU?

650
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,100
( laughing )

651
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:43,300
FINISH YOUR BUSINESS.

652
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,834
THE JURY'S COMING BACK.

653
00:38:44,834 --> 00:38:46,767
HURRY IT UP!

654
00:39:09,868 --> 00:39:12,467
WHAT'S THE VERDICT?

655
00:39:20,868 --> 00:39:22,534
INNOCENT.

656
00:39:24,634 --> 00:39:27,000
<i>Judge:
THANK YOU.</i>

657
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
THE DEFENDANT
IS FREE.

658
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:32,300
DON'T EVER KNOCK
THIS CAMP TO ME.

659
00:39:38,067 --> 00:39:39,501
( laughing )

660
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:45,033
GOOD LUCK, SON.

661
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:50,667
<i>Man:
I NEED A DRINK.</i>

662
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:56,334
Reverend: MR. HICKOK WILL
LIE BESIDE TWO BROTHERS.

663
00:39:56,334 --> 00:39:58,667
ONE HE LIKELY KILLED,
THE OTHER HE KILLED

664
00:39:58,667 --> 00:40:00,868
FOR CERTAIN AND HE'S
BEEN KILLED NOW IN TURN.

665
00:40:00,868 --> 00:40:03,267
SO MUCH BLOOD.

666
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:06,801
AND ON THE BATTLEFIELDS
OF THE BROTHER'S WAR,

667
00:40:06,801 --> 00:40:08,968
<i>I SAW MORE BLOOD
THAN THIS.</i>

668
00:40:08,968 --> 00:40:12,767
AND ASKED THEN AS FOR THE
PURPOSE, AND DID NOT KNOW.

669
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:14,934
AND DON'T KNOW
THE PURPOSE NOW.

670
00:40:14,934 --> 00:40:18,601
BUT KNOW NOW TO TESTIFY
THAT NOT KNOWING,

671
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:21,334
I BELIEVE.

672
00:40:23,334 --> 00:40:25,968
<i>SAINT PAUL TELLS US
BY ONE'S SPIRIT</i>

673
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:28,501
ARE WE ALL BAPTIZED
IN THE ONE BODY.

674
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:32,267
WHETHER WE BE JEW OR
GENTILE, BOND OR FREE.

675
00:40:32,267 --> 00:40:35,601
<i>AND HAVE ALL BEEN MADE
TO DRINK INTO ONE SPIRIT.</i>

676
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:38,367
<i>FOR THE BODY IS NOT ONE MEMBER,
BUT MANY.</i>

677
00:40:38,367 --> 00:40:42,167
HE TELLS US, "THE EYE
CANNOT SAY UNTO THE HAND,

678
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:43,968
'I HAVE NO NEED
OF THEE.'

679
00:40:43,968 --> 00:40:46,000
NOR AGAIN,
THE HEAD TO THE FEET,

680
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,434
'I HAVE NO NEED OF THEE.'

681
00:40:47,434 --> 00:40:49,501
THEY MUCH MORE
THOSE MEMBERS OF THE BODY

682
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:51,000
WHICH SEEM TO BE
MORE FEEBLE.

683
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,767
AND THOSE
MEMBERS OF THE BODY

684
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:54,767
WHICH WE THINK
OF AS LESS HONORABLE,

685
00:40:54,767 --> 00:40:56,701
ALL ARE NECESSARY."

686
00:40:56,701 --> 00:41:01,033
<i>HE SAYS THAT THERE SHOULD
BE NO SCHISM IN THE BODY,</i>

687
00:41:01,033 --> 00:41:05,033
BUT THAT THE MEMBERS SHOULD HAVE
THE SAME CARE, ONE TO ANOTHER.

688
00:41:05,033 --> 00:41:07,501
<i>AND WHERE THE ONE
MEMBER SUFFER,</i>

689
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:10,467
ALL THE MEMBERS
SUFFER WITH IT.

690
00:41:14,534 --> 00:41:16,968
I BELIEVE
IN GOD'S PURPOSE,

691
00:41:16,968 --> 00:41:18,968
NOT KNOWING IT.

692
00:41:18,968 --> 00:41:22,534
<i>I ASK HIM,
MOVING IN ME,</i>

693
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:24,801
<i>TO ALLOW ME
TO SEE HIS WILL.</i>

694
00:41:24,801 --> 00:41:26,901
I ASK HIM,

695
00:41:28,334 --> 00:41:30,133
MOVING IN OTHERS,

696
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:33,534
<i>TO ALLOW THEM TO SEE IT.</i>

697
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:42,367
LET US SING
"HOW FIRM A FOUNDATION"

698
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:44,300
AS MR. HICKOK
IS LAID TO REST.

* FIERY TRIALS

702

* ALL SUFFICIENT

* THE FLAME

707
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,133

709
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,634
THEY TURNED
HIM LOOSE.

710
00:42:38,634 --> 00:42:41,400
- McCALL?
- THEY TURNED HIM LOOSE.

711
00:42:44,934 --> 00:42:51,100
* AND THY GOLD
TO REFINE. *

( chatting )

714
00:43:49,367 --> 00:43:51,300
- CAN WE GET STARTED?
- HE'S NEAR DONE.

715
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,000
OH, YOU CAN TELL?

716
00:43:57,467 --> 00:44:00,033
CAN YOU BELIEVE THEY LET
THE SON OF A BITCH GO?

717
00:44:00,033 --> 00:44:01,968
YEAH, I GUESS I CAN.
HERE HE COMES.

718
00:44:04,133 --> 00:44:06,067
OH, THANK YOU
FOR WAITING.

719
00:44:06,067 --> 00:44:08,734
YOU'VE BEEN SO KIND
TO ME, A STRANGER.

720
00:44:08,734 --> 00:44:11,267
MANY OF US HAVE
ASKED BEING BROKEN,

721
00:44:11,267 --> 00:44:12,934
HOW ARE WE TO LIVE?

722
00:44:12,934 --> 00:44:14,734
YOU TOOK ME INTO
THE BODY OF THE CAMP.

723
00:44:14,734 --> 00:44:16,834
I'M FROM
ETOBICOKE, ONTARIO.

724
00:44:16,834 --> 00:44:18,834
I'M FROM
VIENNA, AUSTRIA.

725
00:44:18,834 --> 00:44:21,767
MAY I ASK,
MR. BULLOCK,

726
00:44:21,767 --> 00:44:24,033
WHAT YOU FEEL NOW
MAY BE YOUR PART?

727
00:44:24,033 --> 00:44:26,100
CAN'T SAY I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

728
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,234
I WOULD NOT IMPOSE,
IT'S BEEN GIVEN ME TO ASK.

729
00:44:28,234 --> 00:44:30,334
YOU DID WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN GIVEN TO DO.

730
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,033
THE CAMP WAS LUCKY YOU
WERE HERE TODAY.

731
00:44:33,033 --> 00:44:35,067
NO, I'M A FRAIL
AND FEEBLE VESSEL,

732
00:44:35,067 --> 00:44:36,968
BUT NONE OF US CAN
DENY OUR PARTS-

733
00:44:36,968 --> 00:44:39,234
CAN WE FINISH THE
GODDAMNED WALK IN QUIET?

734
00:44:41,501 --> 00:44:43,434
CERTAINLY, SIR.

735
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:48,133
SORRY, REVEREND.

736
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,334
CAN I GET YOUR AUTOGRAPH
PLEASE?

737
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,601
THERE YOU GO,
THAT'S FOR YOU.

738
00:45:22,601 --> 00:45:25,167
SHOULD IT EVER BE
YOUR MISFORTUNE,

739
00:45:25,167 --> 00:45:27,667
GENTLEMEN, OR MINE

740
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:29,968
TO NEED TO KILL A MAN,

741
00:45:29,968 --> 00:45:32,901
<i>THEN LET US
TOAST TOGETHER</i>

742
00:45:32,901 --> 00:45:34,801
THE POSSIBILITY
THAT OUR TRIALS

743
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:37,033
BE HELD IN THIS CAMP.

744
00:45:37,033 --> 00:45:40,067
<i>Man:

745
00:45:40,067 --> 00:45:42,133
<i>Al: WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
IT'S JACK, AIN'T IT?</i>

746
00:45:42,133 --> 00:45:44,567
YES, SIR.
YOU BUY ME A DRINK,

747
00:45:44,567 --> 00:45:45,968
I'LL MAKE MY MARK.

748
00:45:45,968 --> 00:45:48,100
STICK AROUND CAMP, JACK.

749
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,367
I WILL MAKE MINE FOR YOU.

750
00:45:50,367 --> 00:45:53,167
WHAT IN THE HELL'S
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

751
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,434
MEANS THERE'S A HORSE FOR
YOU OUTSIDE YOU WANT TO GET ON

752
00:45:55,434 --> 00:45:57,567
BEFORE SOMEBODY MURDERS
YOU WHO GIVES A FUCK

753
00:45:57,567 --> 00:45:59,567
ABOUT RIGHT
AND WRONG, OR I DO.

754
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:04,501
IT'S THE PAINT, JACK.

755
00:46:04,501 --> 00:46:06,801
RIGHT OUTSIDE MY JOINT.

756
00:46:06,801 --> 00:46:09,567
RUN FOR YOUR
FUCKING LIFE.

757
00:46:14,701 --> 00:46:17,267
JACK McCALL
RUNS FROM NO MAN.

758
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,767
REMEMBER THIS WHEN
YOU RUN YOUR OWN PLACE.

759
00:46:28,767 --> 00:46:32,234
THAT TYPE GUY HANGING ROUND
GETS PEOPLE AGITATED.

760
00:46:34,033 --> 00:46:35,767
FORCES 'EM TO TAKE
A POSITION,

761
00:46:35,767 --> 00:46:37,267
ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER.

762
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,767
AND AGITATION

763
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:42,968
BRINGS A SLIGHT BUMP
UP IN WHISKEY SALES.

764
00:46:42,968 --> 00:46:46,200
BUT THE SALE
OF CUNT PLUMMETS.

765
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,467
THAT'S WHY I OFTEN
WONDER IF I SHOULD TAKE

766
00:46:48,467 --> 00:46:50,400
THAT FUCKING PICTURE
OF LINCOLN DOWN.

767
00:46:57,634 --> 00:47:00,968
COME ON.

768
00:47:03,834 --> 00:47:05,267
Jack:
YAH, YAH.

769
00:47:18,834 --> 00:47:20,534
IT'S ME, MISTER!

770
00:47:22,067 --> 00:47:24,000
BACK WITH WATER.

771
00:47:35,434 --> 00:47:37,033
ARE YOU DEAD?!

772
00:47:47,334 --> 00:47:50,133
YEAH!
THERE YOU ARE.

773
00:47:51,801 --> 00:47:54,400
CHOKING AND COUGHING
JUST LIKE THE REST OF US.

774
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:02,367
SAW THE WIDOW'S
HUSBAND IN THE CREEK.

775
00:48:02,367 --> 00:48:04,901
'LESS THEY'RE KEEPING
MORE THAN ONE BODY COOL

776
00:48:04,901 --> 00:48:06,801
FOR SHIPPING BACK EAST.

777
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,334
TEATHERED,
WRAPPED UP,

778
00:48:09,334 --> 00:48:11,734
AND FLOATING
LIKE A LURE

779
00:48:11,734 --> 00:48:13,334
FOR SOME HUGE
FUCKING FISH.

780
00:48:16,334 --> 00:48:18,701
THE WIDOW'S GOT
THE LITTLE ONE NOW.

781
00:48:18,701 --> 00:48:21,501
I HAD HER FOR AWHILE,

782
00:48:21,501 --> 00:48:25,434
BUT I AIN'T THE TYPE
SHE SHOULD BE WITH LONG TERM.

783
00:48:25,434 --> 00:48:27,701
FUCKING DRUNK
AND SO FORTH.

784
00:48:32,334 --> 00:48:34,300
AND WHEN I WAS
DOWN AT THE CREEK

785
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,267
I HEARD VOICES

786
00:48:39,067 --> 00:48:41,033
AND I WENT TO WHERE
THEY WERE SINGING.

787
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:47,200
AND I SAW AS THEY LAID
MY POOR BILL TO REST.

788
00:48:51,334 --> 00:48:54,133
<i>( sobbing )</i>

789
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,834
NOW THERE'S A BIRD
I AIN'T NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

790
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,634
SHALL I TALK
ABOUT IT TO YOU?

791
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,767
( groaning )

792
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,901
THE MAN IS A LUNATIC.

793
00:49:54,901 --> 00:49:56,734
HIGH WATER, HE NEVER
MADE MUCH SENSE.

794
00:49:56,734 --> 00:49:58,567
BUT NOW HE JUST UTTERS
PURE GIBBERISH.

795
00:49:58,567 --> 00:50:00,234
DID HE LOOK
PALE TO YOU?

796
00:50:00,234 --> 00:50:02,200
- WHAT?
- DID HE SEEM PALE?

797
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,434
HOW THE FUCK DO I KNOW
IF HE WAS PALE OR NOT?

798
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:06,968
- HE LOOKED PALE TO ME.
- WHAT IF HE WAS?

799
00:50:06,968 --> 00:50:09,133
LET'S SAY HE WAS. WILL
YOU SHUT UP ABOUT IT?

800
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:12,567
WHAT IS MY PART
AND YOUR PART?

801
00:50:12,567 --> 00:50:14,901
WHAT PART OF MY PART
IS YOUR PART?

802
00:50:14,901 --> 00:50:16,534
IS MY FOOT YOUR KNEE?

803
00:50:16,534 --> 00:50:19,167
WHAT ABOUT YOUR EAR?
WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?

804
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:20,200
YEAH.

805
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,934
I DON'T KNOW.

806
00:50:21,934 --> 00:50:24,067
WHAT DON'T YOU KNOW?

807
00:50:24,067 --> 00:50:25,934
<i>IF HE WAS PALE OR NOT?</i>

808
00:50:25,934 --> 00:50:27,934
WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO DO.

809
00:50:27,934 --> 00:50:30,267
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO DO ANYTHING!

810
00:50:30,267 --> 00:50:32,100
LET'S AGREE TO THAT.

811
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,100
NOT ONE FUCKING THING THAT
I DON'T DECIDE I'M GONNA.

812
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,667
ALL RIGHT, SOL?

SUSPENDERS.

815
00:50:43,534 --> 00:50:45,334
GOD DAMN IT!

816
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,734
IF I KILL THE DROOP-EYED SON OF A BITCH

817
00:50:50,734 --> 00:50:52,667
AND MY PARTS
GETTING HANGED FOR IT,

818
00:50:52,667 --> 00:50:54,367
GOOD LUCK WITH
THE FUCKING STORE.

819
00:50:54,367 --> 00:50:55,934
ALL RIGHT.

820
00:50:55,934 --> 00:50:58,000
I WILL WRITE TO MARTHA
AND SEE IT POSTED.

821
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,901
- YOU LOOK OUT AFTER THAT WIDOW.
- ALL RIGHT, SETH.

822
00:51:00,901 --> 00:51:02,901
CAN I IMPOSE ON YOU
TO PACK A BAG FOR ME

823
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:04,901
TO CUT DOWN ON THE
COCKSUCKER'S HEAD START?

824
00:51:04,901 --> 00:51:07,667
BE READY FOR YOU
WHEN YOU RIDE OUT.

825
00:51:07,667 --> 00:51:09,367
THANKS, SOL.

826
