1
00:02:11,062 --> 00:02:12,814
Thought it'd be
another stagecoach.

2
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:15,576
Not this time.
That's our wagon, all right...

3
00:03:06,902 --> 00:03:10,099
Remember, don't hit
that dynamite too soon.

4
00:03:14,742 --> 00:03:16,539
I can't do it!

5
00:03:19,622 --> 00:03:22,773
- Can't do what?
- I can't see the marker.

6
00:03:22,942 --> 00:03:26,218
Been in these blazing rocks
so long I can't see.

7
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:56,973
Briggs! Shroeder!

8
00:05:57,422 --> 00:06:01,654
- Rumsey!
- They got Rumsey. I seen it.

9
00:06:03,462 --> 00:06:06,215
Check the others.
They can't all be dead.

10
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:08,816
I'm afraid they got Shroeder too.

11
00:06:09,782 --> 00:06:13,252
Jamie, go get the mules.
Look over the bluecoats.

12
00:06:16,982 --> 00:06:19,576
There's only four boxes of gold.

13
00:06:21,742 --> 00:06:24,415
Get that gold on the pack mules.

14
00:06:35,702 --> 00:06:38,136
Major, over here, quick!

15
00:06:42,822 --> 00:06:45,131
He's alive. I didn't shoot him...

16
00:06:45,302 --> 00:06:48,339
...just shot the gun out of his hand.
What'll we do?

17
00:06:50,622 --> 00:06:53,455
I don't know. Can't take prisoners,
we have no medicine.

18
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:54,975
We'll leave water and food...

19
00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:58,452
The horses are still around.
He could make it back to Carson City.

20
00:06:58,622 --> 00:07:02,092
Put that away.
Help me get him against that rock.

21
00:07:07,782 --> 00:07:10,740
Cass, you and Egan get the gold
out of that wagon, quick.

22
00:07:12,142 --> 00:07:14,337
Captain, we're Confederate soldiers.

23
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:17,062
On special duty from
the army of northern Virginia.

24
00:07:18,862 --> 00:07:23,333
Better keep me alive, reb.
You're going to need me.

25
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:26,577
Need you? Why?

26
00:07:27,182 --> 00:07:29,332
- What's he trying to...?
- You might want this.

27
00:07:29,502 --> 00:07:31,094
Thanks, Egan.

28
00:07:31,262 --> 00:07:35,380
- What were you trying to tell us?
- The war is over.

29
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:37,772
You got licked, reb.

30
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:40,217
You're lying.
Lee would never give up.

31
00:07:40,382 --> 00:07:42,771
Over a month ago.

32
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:45,536
Lee surren...

33
00:07:46,022 --> 00:07:48,536
You better keep me alive.

34
00:07:51,022 --> 00:07:55,573
He was lying. Just trying to keep
us here. He was lying, that's all.

35
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:01,134
Maybe.

36
00:08:01,422 --> 00:08:04,494
We'll keep our meeting with
Captain Peterson. We'll know then.

37
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:35,102
They told me you'd been under fire.

38
00:08:35,262 --> 00:08:39,141
I was. Five and a half days,
Milledgeville.

39
00:08:39,302 --> 00:08:41,133
And you never killed a man?

40
00:08:41,302 --> 00:08:42,940
I don't know.

41
00:08:43,862 --> 00:08:45,534
No, sir.

42
00:08:46,382 --> 00:08:48,942
I want you with us when we get home.
You won't be...

43
00:08:49,102 --> 00:08:51,218
Hey, Matt, we're here!

44
00:08:52,302 --> 00:08:54,577
Somewhere between here
and the Texas border...

45
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,698
...you're going to have to grow up.

46
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:21,780
Major! Just about given you up!

47
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:25,937
You're a sight for sore eyes,
major. All of you.

48
00:09:31,102 --> 00:09:32,660
Everything came off all right?

49
00:09:33,382 --> 00:09:37,136
We lost three men. We got the gold,
over a quarter-million dollars' worth.

50
00:09:37,302 --> 00:09:40,977
Well, it'll be worth 3000 men
to the Confederacy...

51
00:09:41,142 --> 00:09:44,339
- How long have you been here?
- Here? Right here?

52
00:09:45,142 --> 00:09:47,178
- Right here.
- Too long, major.

53
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:51,381
Let's get that gold into the medicine
wagon, and you fellas dust out of here.

54
00:09:53,422 --> 00:09:55,174
Time's your problem now.

55
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,335
Where were you
before you came up here?

56
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:01,734
Why? What's the trouble, major?

57
00:10:03,222 --> 00:10:05,611
Not sure. Where were you?

58
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:11,175
Moving around, getting known.

59
00:10:11,382 --> 00:10:14,692
Virginia City was my last stop,
three weeks ago. Why?

60
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:17,773
Then I won't have to tell you.

61
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:20,820
The gold isn't worth even six men
to the Confederacy.

62
00:10:20,982 --> 00:10:22,381
There isn't any Confederacy.

63
00:10:27,382 --> 00:10:31,057
I wanted to ride out and warn you,
but it was too late.

64
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:35,257
I was sure it was too late.

65
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:39,060
If I'd have left here,
I'd have missed you for sure.

66
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:47,891
- I wasn't gonna take it for myself. L...
- We've heard enough.

67
00:10:48,062 --> 00:10:51,771
You knew where we planned to attack.
You had time to come out and stop it.

68
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,410
To save the lives of over a dozen...

69
00:11:09,662 --> 00:11:10,981
Don't ever try that again.

70
00:11:14,142 --> 00:11:16,019
What did you say?

71
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:19,734
The war's over.
There's no army, no rank.

72
00:11:19,902 --> 00:11:22,496
Don't ever use your
hands on me again.

73
00:11:25,622 --> 00:11:27,533
Listen to me, all of you.

74
00:11:27,702 --> 00:11:29,454
The war's not over for us.

75
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,090
Those dead men back there
were Nevada Volunteers.

76
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:35,374
This territory will be full of posses,
men from the war...

77
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:38,181
...and they're not gonna believe
a word we tell them.

78
00:11:39,062 --> 00:11:41,781
We needed Peterson, but he's dead.

79
00:11:42,022 --> 00:11:45,332
Till we get out of here,
someone's gotta give orders.

80
00:11:45,662 --> 00:11:48,859
So if we're gonna have trouble
from you, let's have it now.

81
00:11:52,582 --> 00:11:57,258
Fine. We'll have to let these horses
blow. We'll camp here till night falls.

82
00:12:05,222 --> 00:12:07,736
I guess I lost my head, Matt.

83
00:12:08,822 --> 00:12:10,813
What's happened to you?

84
00:12:10,982 --> 00:12:14,099
- Is it that easy to kill a man?
- Well, isn't it?

85
00:12:14,262 --> 00:12:17,220
What else we been doing
for the past five years?

86
00:12:18,422 --> 00:12:20,856
Peterson had it coming.

87
00:12:21,422 --> 00:12:23,492
Is that all it takes?

88
00:12:25,022 --> 00:12:27,058
You've changed.

89
00:12:27,222 --> 00:12:29,452
A lot more than you think.

90
00:12:30,422 --> 00:12:32,936
Well, you haven't.
You've known me for 10 years...

91
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:36,253
...and you've never stopped trying
to cut me down to your size.

92
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,858
Take care of your horse.

93
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:51,292
I'll take over, Cass.

94
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:58,536
- Coffee's still hot.
- Coffee?

95
00:12:58,702 --> 00:13:01,614
I ain't been thinking
about coffee, boy.

96
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:16,494
Thank you.

97
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,858
That razor's not as sharp as it was,
but it's yours.

98
00:13:23,822 --> 00:13:26,814
Whiskers just grow right back again.

99
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:30,892
Well, we buried the Confederacy.

100
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:34,737
We've talked about everything
but what's really on our mind.

101
00:13:34,902 --> 00:13:37,462
- Anybody talked about that yet?
- About what, Cass?

102
00:13:37,622 --> 00:13:39,852
If you don't know, you ain't human.

103
00:13:42,582 --> 00:13:44,174
The gold?

104
00:13:44,342 --> 00:13:46,094
You're human.

105
00:13:47,302 --> 00:13:49,452
What do you think we should do?

106
00:13:50,342 --> 00:13:52,219
It ain't as if we stole it.

107
00:13:52,382 --> 00:13:55,055
It came into our hands
as part of the war.

108
00:13:55,222 --> 00:13:56,575
For me...

109
00:13:56,742 --> 00:13:59,575
...I aim to take a share home with me.

110
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:02,210
Anybody got a better suggestion?

111
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:08,250
Egan, how do you feel about it?

112
00:14:08,462 --> 00:14:11,852
Lt'd be hard to see the wrong
in keeping it when a few hours ago...

113
00:14:12,022 --> 00:14:14,741
...there was no wrong in killing for it.

114
00:14:16,782 --> 00:14:18,181
What else is there to do?

115
00:14:18,342 --> 00:14:21,459
Give it back to the Union government?
They'd probably hang us.

116
00:14:21,622 --> 00:14:25,137
Maybe. We'll probably get
strung up for thieves in any case.

117
00:14:25,302 --> 00:14:28,533
Is that what you wanna do?
To give that stuff back?

118
00:14:29,022 --> 00:14:33,413
That's what won the war, not courage
or being in the right. Just gold.

119
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:36,654
If the Union wants it back,
they'll have to fight us for it.

120
00:14:36,822 --> 00:14:38,972
Keeping it for ourselves
is something else.

121
00:14:39,142 --> 00:14:42,214
The South is still there,
maybe she could use it.

122
00:14:43,062 --> 00:14:44,973
Not my share, major.

123
00:14:45,142 --> 00:14:48,976
If the war is over, it's over,
and there ain't nothing that...

124
00:15:22,782 --> 00:15:27,412
I'm coming home to you, Bessie,
this time for good.

125
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:31,731
No more wandering off,
I promise you.

126
00:15:32,022 --> 00:15:36,652
I'll even go to church with you
this Sunday, like you always wanted.

127
00:15:37,502 --> 00:15:40,812
We'll ride up fine.

128
00:15:41,262 --> 00:15:44,777
All the folks will look at you
like you was Queen of the May.

129
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:47,331
- You'll be wearing...
- I've heard all I can take.

130
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:51,973
- I'd rather hear Walsh whistle.
- Another posse! Drop those flaps!

131
00:16:07,462 --> 00:16:10,852
If I tap on the canvas,
come out shooting.

132
00:16:13,422 --> 00:16:15,174
Morning, gentlemen. Morning!

133
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:18,095
- Got anything to drink in that cart?
- Sure thing.

134
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:20,173
Has that hogwash got any alky in it?

135
00:16:20,342 --> 00:16:21,775
Open up, doc. Customers!

136
00:16:21,942 --> 00:16:25,855
Why don't you give the good doctor
a chance to answer them questions?

137
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:32,172
I'll just borrow this, doc.
I lost my sombrero this morning.

138
00:16:32,702 --> 00:16:36,490
- You'll buy it. It'll cost you $5.
- Hey, he's got a price for everything.

139
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,254
You're Doc Collings, ain't you?

140
00:16:39,662 --> 00:16:41,141
That I am, sir. Who are you?

141
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:45,055
We're deputies, friend,
deputized fresh this morning.

142
00:16:45,222 --> 00:16:47,577
And we gonna look you over.

143
00:16:50,102 --> 00:16:51,820
Help yourself. Help yourself.

144
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:55,692
Give me a hand, Smitty.

145
00:17:01,502 --> 00:17:05,131
You wouldn't be after the gang
that held up that gold shipment?

146
00:17:05,302 --> 00:17:09,136
- How did you know about that, friend?
- You're about to miss the hanging.

147
00:17:09,302 --> 00:17:12,658
They were bringing them in when
I came through Salt Flats.

148
00:17:15,462 --> 00:17:17,771
Come on! Let's get out of here!

149
00:17:28,742 --> 00:17:31,051
- That was too close.
- Yeah.

150
00:17:31,222 --> 00:17:35,374
Major, what would've happened
if they'd looked in the back?

151
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:38,534
We'll have some rope to go with that
if we don't think fast.

152
00:17:38,702 --> 00:17:40,818
They'll be back
looking for this wagon.

153
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,216
All right, pull them up.

154
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:24,772
Wrong coach, boys.
All I got is people.

155
00:19:24,942 --> 00:19:27,331
You got some more people now.

156
00:19:32,502 --> 00:19:33,981
How many in there?

157
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:36,497
Two. Man and a woman.

158
00:19:36,662 --> 00:19:38,220
And one of them's very pretty.

159
00:19:43,302 --> 00:19:46,578
- Travelling alone, miss?
- She's my fiance.

160
00:19:47,822 --> 00:19:49,050
Jamie, get between them.

161
00:19:49,262 --> 00:19:52,174
I reckon who you are now,
and I don't like it.

162
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:54,572
You don't have to like it, jehu.

163
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:14,937
- Did he have a gun?
- I was just fixing to look.

164
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:25,412
You got one too, miss?

165
00:20:26,622 --> 00:20:28,021
Search her.

166
00:20:33,862 --> 00:20:36,501
Looks like Army. Union Army.

167
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,780
- She was a nurse.
- Doesn't she ever talk?

168
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:42,053
Get on with it.

169
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:56,736
Well, she doesn't have a gun.

170
00:21:06,022 --> 00:21:08,172
Come on, use that whip.

171
00:24:15,862 --> 00:24:18,092
Drop it! Inside!

172
00:24:38,582 --> 00:24:41,972
Why drag us into this?
At least let her go!

173
00:24:43,062 --> 00:24:46,577
- Get them over there!
- Come on. You over here!

174
00:24:48,982 --> 00:24:51,212
You too! Come on, over here!

175
00:24:54,582 --> 00:24:57,142
Jamie, close that door!

176
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:04,697
Four of you cover the back!

177
00:25:04,862 --> 00:25:08,172
Go on! Hey,
somebody get that coach!

178
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:34,501
Miss, he's got a bullet in him.

179
00:25:51,422 --> 00:25:54,494
- How many out there?
- Five, I think.

180
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:56,660
Let's see if I can make it four.

181
00:25:56,822 --> 00:26:00,178
If we have to kill to get out, we'll do it,
but I'll tell you when.

182
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:02,378
Check that back room.

183
00:26:08,022 --> 00:26:09,501
How bad is it?

184
00:26:09,662 --> 00:26:13,257
I can get the bullet out,
but not here on the floor.

185
00:26:15,702 --> 00:26:18,011
I'm not hurt.

186
00:26:18,182 --> 00:26:20,138
I was just scared.

187
00:26:20,302 --> 00:26:23,055
Sure, you scare easily.

188
00:26:30,262 --> 00:26:32,218
Hey, Quincey!

189
00:26:33,902 --> 00:26:35,381
Major!

190
00:26:44,262 --> 00:26:46,378
You might've killed him,
you knothead.

191
00:26:46,782 --> 00:26:48,261
You mean I didn't?

192
00:26:48,422 --> 00:26:51,937
Better hope that he's still alive
till I get a chance to talk to him.

193
00:26:52,102 --> 00:26:54,093
Then you can do with him
as you mind to.

194
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:57,572
- Hey out there!
- Get him into the shed there.

195
00:26:58,862 --> 00:27:01,217
Throw some water on him.
We're listening!

196
00:27:01,382 --> 00:27:03,293
We've got two
coach passengers in here!

197
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:05,373
Give us our man,
we'll turn them loose!

198
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:08,340
All right, turn them loose!

199
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,936
Bring the man out
where I can see him!

200
00:27:12,582 --> 00:27:16,541
Now, listen, who's giving the orders?
Man, we don't have to make no deals!

201
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:20,820
You can stay holed up in there
till Judgment Day. We can wait!

202
00:27:25,262 --> 00:27:27,298
Finish tying them.

203
00:27:30,702 --> 00:27:33,136
Got a bad shoulder, son.

204
00:27:33,302 --> 00:27:35,133
Want my hands back
of me like hers...

205
00:27:35,302 --> 00:27:38,817
...you'll have to break
a couple of bones first.

206
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,136
What'd they do with Cass, kill him?

207
00:27:48,302 --> 00:27:51,374
I don't know. How many out there?

208
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:54,420
Three, maybe four.
They're up in the rocks.

209
00:27:58,022 --> 00:28:01,776
The bleeding's stopped.
I'll need something to probe with.

210
00:28:01,942 --> 00:28:04,740
- Will you get it, or shall I?
- Go ahead.

211
00:28:04,902 --> 00:28:07,132
- I wanna tell you...
- I don't want any thanks.

212
00:28:07,302 --> 00:28:11,693
I wouldn't help if I had a choice.
A nurse doesn't have one.

213
00:28:18,462 --> 00:28:22,660
- I'm afraid I'll live.
- Good. We may need you.

214
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:26,417
You'll find the scissors
in the right side of that cupboard.

215
00:28:39,022 --> 00:28:41,058
I'll take the gun.

216
00:28:43,702 --> 00:28:47,377
What were you planning to do
with this against four of us?

217
00:28:51,702 --> 00:28:53,340
We'll be gone before midnight...

218
00:28:53,502 --> 00:28:56,096
...and there's no harm
intended toward any of you.

219
00:28:56,262 --> 00:28:58,378
Try to remember that.

220
00:29:02,262 --> 00:29:05,254
Seen anybody ride away
back the way we came, Jamie?

221
00:29:05,422 --> 00:29:08,653
Nobody's rode off any direction.

222
00:29:10,862 --> 00:29:13,422
I think they smell gold, Jamie.

223
00:29:16,102 --> 00:29:18,457
- I'll need some help.
- There's a man in there.

224
00:29:18,622 --> 00:29:20,419
He'll help you.

225
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:33,178
- Want me to douse him again?
- Don't drown him.

226
00:29:33,342 --> 00:29:36,573
- We got plenty...
- All right, you win!

227
00:29:39,142 --> 00:29:42,418
- You ready to come out?
- We're ready to give you the gold.

228
00:29:42,582 --> 00:29:44,857
Isn't that what you're after?

229
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:47,856
You've got it with you?

230
00:29:48,302 --> 00:29:50,497
We're not that crazy!
We left it back there!

231
00:29:50,782 --> 00:29:53,342
Over a quarter million!

232
00:29:54,902 --> 00:29:56,972
Let us go, and it's all yours!

233
00:30:00,982 --> 00:30:03,780
We left it practically
on top of the ground!

234
00:30:03,942 --> 00:30:06,581
Better send back for it,
or it won't be there!

235
00:30:06,742 --> 00:30:08,653
It won't be where?

236
00:30:08,822 --> 00:30:10,096
Make us a deal.

237
00:30:12,502 --> 00:30:14,458
All right, you tell us where it's at...

238
00:30:14,622 --> 00:30:17,136
...and there won't be nothing
left of us but dust.

239
00:30:17,302 --> 00:30:20,055
- Now, you know that.
- Oh, no, I don't!

240
00:30:20,222 --> 00:30:22,019
There's nothing we can do about it.

241
00:30:22,182 --> 00:30:24,571
You either take that gamble
or you don't, one.

242
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:26,095
That's up to you.

243
00:30:28,782 --> 00:30:30,738
Well, you taking that chance?

244
00:30:31,342 --> 00:30:34,891
All right, I'll take it.
Did you find the wagon?

245
00:30:35,142 --> 00:30:38,817
Sure did, and drank
some of that good elixir.

246
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:42,579
Take 30 paces from
the front of the wagon.

247
00:30:42,742 --> 00:30:45,097
Then turn right 20 more.

248
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:47,378
The gold's there
with sand tossed over it.

249
00:30:48,462 --> 00:30:50,771
We can go now, reb?

250
00:30:50,942 --> 00:30:53,615
I didn't expect you
to take my word for it!

251
00:30:53,782 --> 00:30:57,934
Send a man to look!
He can be back by morning!

252
00:30:58,702 --> 00:31:00,499
Sure, we do just that!

253
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:20,691
Here's the bullet. He'll be whistling
that song again soon enough.

254
00:31:21,302 --> 00:31:23,657
Tell me. What happens
when the man they send...

255
00:31:23,822 --> 00:31:26,097
...comes back with the bad news?

256
00:31:26,742 --> 00:31:30,257
We're still here! All of us!
And we're staying!

257
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:34,174
Does it surprise you to find
people who aren't like you?

258
00:31:34,342 --> 00:31:37,857
They're doing what I counted on,
but what are we like? Go on, tell us.

259
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:40,616
She can't, and neither can I.

260
00:31:40,782 --> 00:31:43,615
What is a man like
who'd shoot down a dozen men?

261
00:31:44,382 --> 00:31:46,100
What men?

262
00:31:48,502 --> 00:31:49,730
What men?

263
00:31:50,262 --> 00:31:54,335
Nevada Volunteers,
the gold-train convoy.

264
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,090
How many dead?

265
00:31:58,262 --> 00:32:00,492
Every last one.

266
00:32:06,182 --> 00:32:09,015
Martha, maybe he...

267
00:32:09,182 --> 00:32:11,138
He might've...

268
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:17,339
- Your son?
- Hers.

269
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,652
My grandson.

270
00:32:26,582 --> 00:32:29,938
- It might make you feel better if...
- Get away from me.

271
00:32:31,022 --> 00:32:32,421
I want you to hear this.

272
00:32:34,462 --> 00:32:37,374
If your son is dead,
it's because he was a soldier.

273
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:40,010
If he was killed,
it was by another soldier.

274
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:43,300
Eight of us came up here
to Nevada six weeks ago.

275
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,498
The war was still going on then.

276
00:32:45,662 --> 00:32:48,415
We'd been ordered to attack
a convoyed gold shipment.

277
00:32:48,582 --> 00:32:50,857
We carried out those orders.

278
00:32:51,022 --> 00:32:55,777
Over a dozen men were killed,
Union and Confederate soldiers.

279
00:32:55,942 --> 00:32:58,536
It wasn't until afterward
we learned that...

280
00:32:58,702 --> 00:33:01,136
That the war had ended.

281
00:33:01,302 --> 00:33:03,975
Now, that's a tall one.

282
00:33:04,142 --> 00:33:06,337
Being honest soldiers,
you left the gold...

283
00:33:06,502 --> 00:33:08,891
...and reported to the nearest
Union Army post.

284
00:33:09,142 --> 00:33:13,613
No, we decided to go home
and take the gold with us.

285
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:22,380
I wanted to tell you what happened
because I thought it might help you.

286
00:33:24,022 --> 00:33:26,377
Nevada's full of you
Confederate deserters...

287
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:29,261
...and your lying excuses
for being what you are.

288
00:33:29,622 --> 00:33:32,375
Martha, please, don't say no more.

289
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:34,533
My son wasn't the first.

290
00:33:34,782 --> 00:33:36,898
You killed my husband too...

291
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,018
...at Gettysburg.

292
00:33:40,182 --> 00:33:42,742
Don't pay her no mind.

293
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:47,380
Get the fire going now
with that coal oil!

294
00:33:56,982 --> 00:34:00,054
- Hey, what happened to Maxwell?
- I don't know.

295
00:34:00,222 --> 00:34:02,656
Maxwell. Maxwell!

296
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:08,093
- Somebody calling me?
- Come here.

297
00:34:11,102 --> 00:34:13,696
Boys, let's get this straight.

298
00:34:13,862 --> 00:34:15,739
Nobody's leaving here.

299
00:34:15,902 --> 00:34:18,416
Go get the rest of the horses
and bring them here.

300
00:34:18,582 --> 00:34:21,858
From now on, that's where they stay,
all of them.

301
00:34:22,022 --> 00:34:26,254
And when we do leave here,
we're all leaving together.

302
00:34:26,422 --> 00:34:28,856
He talks pretty big, don't he?

303
00:34:29,022 --> 00:34:31,297
Think maybe that reb
was telling the truth?

304
00:34:31,462 --> 00:34:34,898
All that gold lying back there
just waiting for some prune picker...

305
00:34:35,062 --> 00:34:37,496
...to stumble over it?
- Maybe.

306
00:34:38,262 --> 00:34:40,935
I wouldn't try riding off to find out
if I were you.

307
00:34:41,102 --> 00:34:44,492
- Who said anything about riding off?
- I did.

308
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,532
- Hey, Quince!
- Yeah?

309
00:34:51,702 --> 00:34:54,375
Come on, you're awake.

310
00:34:55,102 --> 00:34:58,777
Wait a minute! Don't kick a man
when he's down. It ain't sporting.

311
00:34:58,942 --> 00:35:03,220
Besides, he's gonna answer some
questions, nice and straight.

312
00:35:03,382 --> 00:35:06,692
Now, we'll start with the gold.
Where's it at?

313
00:35:07,862 --> 00:35:10,422
I said, where's the gold?

314
00:35:12,502 --> 00:35:16,495
I don't remember. I'm all fogged up.

315
00:35:17,422 --> 00:35:20,255
It's in the house there, ain't it?

316
00:35:20,422 --> 00:35:22,253
No.

317
00:35:22,942 --> 00:35:25,775
- No, we left it behind.
- Where?

318
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:30,414
I don't know. I can't think.

319
00:35:31,382 --> 00:35:33,259
It's no use. He's passed out again.

320
00:36:09,462 --> 00:36:11,054
Molly...

321
00:36:11,222 --> 00:36:13,611
...you know why I told
them that, don't you?

322
00:36:13,782 --> 00:36:16,979
That we were...
That I was your fiance?

323
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:20,339
I thought it would be safer
for you that way.

324
00:36:20,502 --> 00:36:23,699
Maybe I was trying to push you
into making up your mind...

325
00:36:23,862 --> 00:36:25,614
...the right way.

326
00:36:28,302 --> 00:36:29,974
Jamie, let's try it again.

327
00:36:30,142 --> 00:36:32,736
Rolph, go ahead.

328
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:40,702
Wrong again! Weren't nobody there!

329
00:36:40,862 --> 00:36:42,136
We ain't in no hurry!

330
00:36:42,302 --> 00:36:44,736
We can wait for you to come out!

331
00:36:48,462 --> 00:36:51,135
The moon will be down
in a few minutes.

332
00:36:53,142 --> 00:36:55,861
Can that rear door be opened
without too much noise?

333
00:36:56,022 --> 00:36:59,253
It's always been quiet enough
to suit me.

334
00:36:59,422 --> 00:37:01,299
I don't wanna put gags
in your mouths.

335
00:37:01,462 --> 00:37:04,613
I won't, if you'll give me
your word you'll be quiet.

336
00:37:04,782 --> 00:37:08,252
You can have our word,
my daughter's and mine.

337
00:37:08,422 --> 00:37:10,856
You speak for yourself.

338
00:37:11,782 --> 00:37:14,455
Anything I can do to see you...

339
00:37:14,622 --> 00:37:17,580
...Southern butchers killed, I'll do it.

340
00:37:24,982 --> 00:37:27,212
Jamie, come over here.

341
00:37:27,382 --> 00:37:30,135
Come on, you leave that window
for a spell.

342
00:37:33,382 --> 00:37:36,260
Take a good look
at a Southern butcher, ma'am.

343
00:37:40,102 --> 00:37:42,252
He's never killed in his life.

344
00:37:42,422 --> 00:37:47,542
But he watched Sherman's men
burn his farm down and kill his family.

345
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:52,858
He hid in a cane break
and saw his own...

346
00:37:53,022 --> 00:37:54,819
Don't, Egan.

347
00:37:57,062 --> 00:37:58,734
Leave her alone.

348
00:38:07,982 --> 00:38:09,779
I spoke my piece.

349
00:38:09,942 --> 00:38:11,853
Start getting ready.

350
00:38:15,222 --> 00:38:18,214
A gag isn't a very
pleasant thing, ma'am.

351
00:38:20,982 --> 00:38:25,055
If you're to go out weighted down
like mules, you won't get far.

352
00:38:25,782 --> 00:38:27,659
You can have my word to keep silent.

353
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:31,100
We plan to avoid them, ma'am,
not outrun them.

354
00:38:37,142 --> 00:38:39,098
Do I have your word?

355
00:38:39,462 --> 00:38:41,134
You have it.

356
00:38:43,302 --> 00:38:46,339
I'll give you my word
because I believe you.

357
00:38:46,942 --> 00:38:48,660
Thanks.

358
00:38:49,222 --> 00:38:51,861
You still don't know the war is over.

359
00:38:52,022 --> 00:38:54,900
None of you know it,
or you'd have left that gold behind.

360
00:38:55,062 --> 00:38:58,896
Oh, stop it, Molly. They've known
it was over since the day it ended.

361
00:39:15,622 --> 00:39:17,613
We're going now, ma'am.

362
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:20,610
I wish there was something I...

363
00:39:21,622 --> 00:39:23,738
What the major told you was true.

364
00:39:23,902 --> 00:39:25,620
You've gotta believe that, ma'am.

365
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:27,534
Jamie.

366
00:39:29,302 --> 00:39:32,977
Well, goodbye.

367
00:39:35,982 --> 00:39:38,974
We'll get to the horses in the corral.

368
00:39:55,382 --> 00:39:57,771
Hey, they've gone out the back way!

369
00:39:57,942 --> 00:40:00,092
The back way!

370
00:40:11,902 --> 00:40:13,494
Inside!

371
00:40:30,902 --> 00:40:33,621
We ain't as soft-horned
as you thought, are we?

372
00:40:42,502 --> 00:40:44,652
We'll take care of him later.

373
00:40:46,622 --> 00:40:50,092
- I'll count on that.
- Cover that window.

374
00:40:54,182 --> 00:40:55,934
He's hurt bad.

375
00:41:02,862 --> 00:41:04,739
We wanna get on home!

376
00:41:04,902 --> 00:41:09,259
Come out with your hands up. We'll
take you to the sheriff in Carson City!

377
00:41:09,422 --> 00:41:11,811
Yeah, in boxes!

378
00:41:11,982 --> 00:41:14,576
- What'd you wanna say that for?
- Well...

379
00:41:14,742 --> 00:41:18,735
Any cactus head would know they ain't
coming out till we go in and get them.

380
00:41:18,902 --> 00:41:21,939
- You think so, huh?
- I know so.

381
00:41:22,262 --> 00:41:25,379
I seen a nice, fat hay-rope
over in that corral.

382
00:41:25,542 --> 00:41:28,010
How'd you like to go over and get it?

383
00:41:38,742 --> 00:41:42,098
- Has he got a chance?
- I don't know.

384
00:41:45,782 --> 00:41:47,340
We can keep him warm.

385
00:41:47,502 --> 00:41:50,335
Hot compresses may
keep the infection down...

386
00:41:50,502 --> 00:41:53,414
...but I can't get the bullets out.

387
00:41:54,302 --> 00:41:57,453
Well, if he dies, there sits the reason.

388
00:41:58,102 --> 00:42:00,536
What're you planning to do about it?

389
00:42:04,742 --> 00:42:06,778
I didn't believe you, and I still don't.

390
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:09,820
- I did what I thought was right.
- Bring those rags here.

391
00:42:09,982 --> 00:42:11,700
Gag him.

392
00:42:28,982 --> 00:42:31,416
You ought to be grateful
I don't kill him.

393
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:34,142
He gave his word and broke it.
You like him for it?

394
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,860
Yes!

395
00:42:36,822 --> 00:42:40,019
I hope you mean it.
You've got to live with him.

396
00:42:51,662 --> 00:42:53,857
Somebody's gotta be
in there with Egan.

397
00:42:54,022 --> 00:42:56,172
She'll be in there.

398
00:43:07,222 --> 00:43:08,655
Hey, reb!

399
00:43:08,822 --> 00:43:11,052
We got a friend of yours out here!

400
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:13,178
Have a look!

401
00:43:13,902 --> 00:43:17,133
Did you ever see
a hangman's knot before?

402
00:43:17,302 --> 00:43:19,133
Well, have a good look!

403
00:43:25,462 --> 00:43:28,181
You've got about a half a minute
to come out.

404
00:43:28,342 --> 00:43:31,254
Your boy here says you
didn't know the war was over.

405
00:43:31,422 --> 00:43:34,334
Well, here's your chance
to come out and prove it.

406
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:39,491
Got 20 seconds,
then I'm gonna pot that horse!

407
00:43:39,902 --> 00:43:42,177
- Stay in there!
- Wait!

408
00:43:42,342 --> 00:43:44,902
Give us a half-minute to talk it over.

409
00:43:45,302 --> 00:43:46,576
All right.

410
00:43:50,182 --> 00:43:53,936
- Any dynamite left in your pouch?
- One or two sticks.

411
00:44:02,262 --> 00:44:05,140
When I throw the first one, cover me.

412
00:45:09,942 --> 00:45:12,331
I told you we should have
burned them out!

413
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:15,892
- Yeah, I guess you were right.
- It's smarter if you do it my way.

414
00:45:16,062 --> 00:45:18,701
I've been in there,
I know what I'm talking about.

415
00:45:21,622 --> 00:45:22,816
Here you are.

416
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:26,094
Hey.

417
00:45:26,262 --> 00:45:29,459
I was hoping there'd be
some of them around here.

418
00:45:30,822 --> 00:45:34,098
- I thought we'd give them to them.
- Well, go ahead.

419
00:45:34,262 --> 00:45:37,572
Can't you tell when
a man's joking, boy?

420
00:45:41,702 --> 00:45:44,136
After you clean up,
you and Jamie get some sleep.

421
00:45:44,302 --> 00:45:46,452
You can relieve Rolph
and me in a few hours.

422
00:45:46,622 --> 00:45:48,021
Yes, sir.

423
00:45:48,182 --> 00:45:50,616
I guess I don't have to tell you that...

424
00:45:50,782 --> 00:45:52,818
...them ain't deputies out there.

425
00:45:52,982 --> 00:45:55,416
Just a bunch of drifters.

426
00:45:56,382 --> 00:45:59,897
Do they know the gold's in here?

427
00:46:00,982 --> 00:46:03,257
You got them confused.

428
00:46:03,422 --> 00:46:06,732
If they ever find out, though,
and get their hands on it...

429
00:46:06,902 --> 00:46:10,212
...there ain't gonna be nobody left
alive in here to tell.

430
00:46:10,382 --> 00:46:12,498
You got any plans?

431
00:46:14,102 --> 00:46:17,333
We go out shooting
sometime tomorrow.

432
00:46:20,062 --> 00:46:22,178
Wish I hadn't asked.

433
00:46:27,742 --> 00:46:30,097
We'll tunnel under here.

434
00:46:31,182 --> 00:46:34,572
No! It's gotta be quiet.

435
00:46:56,662 --> 00:46:59,301
Can I get you something?
Coffee? Something to eat?

436
00:46:59,462 --> 00:47:01,896
It ain't no use, son.

437
00:47:03,702 --> 00:47:07,695
There ain't nothing you nor
anybody else can do for her.

438
00:47:07,862 --> 00:47:10,501
- I thought maybe if she...
- I know how you feel...

439
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:13,176
...but this ain't anything new
with Martha.

440
00:47:13,342 --> 00:47:17,130
When her man was killed,
her boy joined up.

441
00:47:17,302 --> 00:47:19,736
He never come home again.

442
00:47:20,342 --> 00:47:22,776
And she's made herself
old and miserable...

443
00:47:22,942 --> 00:47:26,059
...and sick with hating ever since.

444
00:47:26,222 --> 00:47:28,816
I've learned to leave her be.

445
00:47:29,462 --> 00:47:31,373
She's still gotta eat, and so do you.

446
00:47:31,542 --> 00:47:34,773
It'd be simpler if you'd just
let me fix it, son.

447
00:47:34,942 --> 00:47:38,218
You know, you don't look
much like a cook to me.

448
00:47:38,382 --> 00:47:41,135
- Well, I don't know about...
- Look, son...

449
00:47:41,302 --> 00:47:45,500
...that story your major tells
is pretty hard to get down.

450
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:48,779
But I reckon you've got your right
to try and prove it...

451
00:47:48,942 --> 00:47:52,491
...which you won't get from that
gang of cutbacks out there.

452
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:58,817
So last night, I decided to be
neutral in this hickboo.

453
00:47:58,982 --> 00:48:02,258
Meantime, I'm powerful hungry.

454
00:48:05,662 --> 00:48:09,132
- Well, I'd like to untie you, but...
- Untie him, Jamie.

455
00:48:16,622 --> 00:48:20,501
- Well, I'm much obliged to you.
- Don't mention it.

456
00:48:20,662 --> 00:48:23,130
- You didn't ask for my word.
- Didn't I?

457
00:48:23,622 --> 00:48:27,695
Well, you've got it,
and if you want proof...

458
00:48:27,862 --> 00:48:31,980
...I keep a gun right
beneath this table.

459
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:35,054
And I could have got it
anytime last night.

460
00:48:35,222 --> 00:48:36,337
You mean...

461
00:48:37,622 --> 00:48:38,896
...this one?

462
00:48:47,542 --> 00:48:50,420
Buckwheats and coffee on the way.

463
00:48:54,822 --> 00:48:58,610
Jamie, ungag him
and give him some water.

464
00:49:03,422 --> 00:49:07,051
I'd like to let you free too.
It's up to you.

465
00:49:08,062 --> 00:49:10,417
I'll stay as I am.

466
00:49:29,142 --> 00:49:31,337
He's out of his head.

467
00:49:50,262 --> 00:49:51,854
Jamie.

468
00:49:56,022 --> 00:49:57,501
Cup.

469
00:50:00,142 --> 00:50:02,610
They've got enough wood
to light us up all month.

470
00:50:02,782 --> 00:50:06,377
We've gotta leave in broad daylight.
It might as well be today.

471
00:50:06,542 --> 00:50:09,340
The longer we're here,
the more danger to them.

472
00:50:09,502 --> 00:50:12,892
We'll start out this rear door
to draw them away from the front.

473
00:50:13,062 --> 00:50:15,895
Then cut back inside
and go out that door.

474
00:50:16,062 --> 00:50:18,018
We take that shed,
we'll have a chance.

475
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:21,572
- The horses are behind it.
- Sounds like sure death to me.

476
00:50:21,742 --> 00:50:25,451
Probably. Is there any other way?

477
00:50:27,582 --> 00:50:29,459
All right, that's it.

478
00:50:29,622 --> 00:50:32,932
We'll eat, wait an hour, and go.
Get your guns ready.

479
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:42,372
Jamie, give our friend here
a fresh gag.

480
00:50:42,742 --> 00:50:46,178
Wait a minute. I wanna talk to you.

481
00:50:46,342 --> 00:50:49,095
As long as we're here,
you'll be kept gagged and tied.

482
00:50:49,262 --> 00:50:53,813
It's got nothing to do with that.
This is important for you.

483
00:50:55,702 --> 00:50:59,012
Calm down. She's asleep.
What's on your mind?

484
00:51:02,222 --> 00:51:06,295
You're planning to shoot your way
out of here sometime today.

485
00:51:06,902 --> 00:51:10,099
Well, if you do, your lives won't be
worth a Confederate dollar.

486
00:51:10,262 --> 00:51:12,651
Now, watch your talk there, boy.

487
00:51:15,662 --> 00:51:18,460
You'll give us a better way,
for a price?

488
00:51:18,622 --> 00:51:20,613
That's right.

489
00:51:21,182 --> 00:51:24,254
How much would
two of those bars weigh?

490
00:51:24,422 --> 00:51:28,813
- About 50 pounds.
- That's over $20,000.

491
00:51:31,302 --> 00:51:33,293
See my coat over there?

492
00:51:35,542 --> 00:51:39,251
It's got two inside pockets.
Put one bar in each pocket.

493
00:51:39,422 --> 00:51:42,812
Now, when I leave here, no one
has to know there's anything in it.

494
00:51:43,222 --> 00:51:44,974
No one at all.

495
00:51:46,782 --> 00:51:50,331
If you can show us a way out
of here alive, you'll get your price.

496
00:51:50,502 --> 00:51:54,700
No one's to know, now or later.

497
00:51:57,342 --> 00:52:00,220
You have our word. Now, hurry it up.

498
00:52:00,822 --> 00:52:03,290
Untie my hands.
I have something to give you.

499
00:52:03,462 --> 00:52:05,020
What?

500
00:52:06,542 --> 00:52:08,260
In my pocket.

501
00:52:12,342 --> 00:52:15,061
I'm a beef contractor.
I know this country like a book.

502
00:52:15,662 --> 00:52:18,574
Paiute Indians live in these hills
not 10 miles from here.

503
00:52:18,742 --> 00:52:20,175
Their chief gave me that.

504
00:52:20,902 --> 00:52:23,496
Show that to them.
Tell them you're from Lee Kemper.

505
00:52:23,662 --> 00:52:26,130
The Indians were hostile
all during the war.

506
00:52:26,302 --> 00:52:29,339
- How were you so friendly?
- My job was to buy beef.

507
00:52:29,502 --> 00:52:32,574
The Army didn't ask where I got it.
I didn't ask the Indians.

508
00:52:32,742 --> 00:52:37,133
Give them that. You'll get horses,
a guide, the food and water you need.

509
00:52:37,302 --> 00:52:40,214
You'll be in Texas before you know it.

510
00:52:40,382 --> 00:52:42,577
What's the matter?

511
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:46,098
We're in here, cutthroats out there,
you're just wasting our time.

512
00:52:46,262 --> 00:52:48,492
Oh, I'm not through yet.

513
00:52:51,422 --> 00:52:56,416
Sometime today or tonight,
this pass will be hit by a flash storm.

514
00:52:56,582 --> 00:52:59,380
Rain so thick you can't see 10 feet.

515
00:53:00,382 --> 00:53:04,500
- Does that interest you?
- I was told this was the dry season.

516
00:53:04,662 --> 00:53:07,381
It is. The rain will only last
about 10 minutes.

517
00:53:07,542 --> 00:53:08,975
Look out that window.

518
00:53:09,142 --> 00:53:12,896
Those clouds only mean one thing
to a Nevadan.

519
00:53:13,062 --> 00:53:16,020
Ask the old man there.
He'll tell you I'm right.

520
00:54:06,182 --> 00:54:08,935
What's the matter?
Something bothering you?

521
00:54:09,742 --> 00:54:12,779
Here's where you get a dose
of your own Yankee medicine.

522
00:54:12,942 --> 00:54:16,491
Miss? Why don't you ask your friend
here what's in his coat over there.

523
00:54:16,662 --> 00:54:18,334
Rolph!

524
00:54:21,142 --> 00:54:23,975
- What does he mean?
- That's what I'd like to know.

525
00:54:24,142 --> 00:54:26,736
Oh, he's just trying
to start something.

526
00:54:26,902 --> 00:54:28,460
Just a minute.

527
00:54:28,622 --> 00:54:31,216
There's some gold in that coat.
I had it put there.

528
00:54:31,382 --> 00:54:33,418
- Why?
- To carry it.

529
00:54:33,582 --> 00:54:36,574
I planned to take the coat.

530
00:54:39,382 --> 00:54:41,532
- Is this true, Lee?
- I suppose so.

531
00:54:41,702 --> 00:54:43,613
How should I know?

532
00:54:51,982 --> 00:54:53,973
What did you do for it, Lee?

533
00:54:54,142 --> 00:54:57,054
Are you going to let this crazy fool...?

534
00:54:58,022 --> 00:55:00,411
Molly. Molly, listen to me.

535
00:55:07,502 --> 00:55:10,096
You didn't change,
I just never knew you.

536
00:55:10,262 --> 00:55:11,490
He had it coming.

537
00:55:11,662 --> 00:55:13,732
Yes. You said that
about Peterson too.

538
00:55:13,902 --> 00:55:16,496
I made my deal with you,
it's up to you to keep it.

539
00:55:16,662 --> 00:55:20,018
Tell her he was lying,
and make this crazy fool back you up.

540
00:55:34,182 --> 00:55:38,095
Did you come in here
to salvage a bargain?

541
00:55:40,662 --> 00:55:43,096
Yes, that's about it.

542
00:55:46,022 --> 00:55:50,413
I owed it to him.
He gave us back our lives.

543
00:55:52,662 --> 00:55:55,381
He also got over $20,000.

544
00:55:56,822 --> 00:55:59,859
Most women would be pretty happy
with a windfall like that.

545
00:56:00,022 --> 00:56:02,172
Your Southern ladies?

546
00:56:06,182 --> 00:56:08,696
I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry.

547
00:56:08,862 --> 00:56:10,853
Please go now.

548
00:56:11,022 --> 00:56:14,298
You've made your effort.
It's not your fault it didn't succeed.

549
00:56:14,462 --> 00:56:16,657
I'm afraid I'm not even sorry.

550
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:23,021
Maybe it'll turn out we did you a favour,
bringing the two of you in here.

551
00:56:23,462 --> 00:56:26,101
You've done nothing for me at all.

552
00:56:26,262 --> 00:56:27,980
You never retreat an inch, do you?

553
00:56:29,222 --> 00:56:31,372
Yes, whenever I'm wrong.

554
00:56:31,542 --> 00:56:34,375
- But I hadn't any plans to marry...
- Nora?

555
00:56:35,622 --> 00:56:37,260
Nora?

556
00:57:10,102 --> 00:57:14,220
Good, good. Take it real slow now,
or they'll hear it sure.

557
00:57:25,022 --> 00:57:28,253
- A little early, ain't you?
- I couldn't sleep.

558
00:57:29,022 --> 00:57:30,740
I'll take over.

559
00:57:43,182 --> 00:57:44,820
How is he?

560
00:57:48,662 --> 00:57:51,415
If he pulls through,
it'll be your doing.

561
00:58:01,742 --> 00:58:03,858
Don't come near me.

562
00:58:04,142 --> 00:58:06,417
I only wanna talk to you.

563
00:58:07,862 --> 00:58:10,251
I never done you any harm.

564
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:14,172
Why are you afraid of me?

565
00:58:15,502 --> 00:58:18,016
We're not outlaws, we're soldiers.

566
00:58:18,742 --> 00:58:20,016
I was an officer.

567
00:58:24,942 --> 00:58:28,776
I wanna talk to you, ma'am,
and I intend doing it.

568
00:58:31,182 --> 00:58:33,173
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

569
00:58:33,582 --> 00:58:35,379
Just hold quiet.

570
00:58:36,022 --> 00:58:37,933
No one's gonna do you any harm.

571
00:59:40,502 --> 00:59:42,458
I've had enough.

572
01:00:25,542 --> 01:00:29,774
If there's anything more from you,
I'll kill you.

573
01:00:29,942 --> 01:00:33,935
You understand? I'll kill you.

574
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:40,254
Cass, give him his gun back.

575
01:00:40,422 --> 01:00:42,617
He ought to have it
took away from him.

576
01:00:42,782 --> 01:00:46,092
Why, I think he'd as lief
shoot you in the back as spit.

577
01:00:47,742 --> 01:00:49,619
Give it to him.

578
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:55,496
You and Jamie take your two hours.

579
01:00:56,822 --> 01:00:58,972
Cover that window.

580
01:02:18,982 --> 01:02:22,418
I've spent the past couple of hours
trying to figure how to...

581
01:02:22,582 --> 01:02:25,460
- To tell you why we...
- I'm all right.

582
01:02:25,622 --> 01:02:28,659
You've no need to apologize.

583
01:02:30,342 --> 01:02:33,095
The apology was for myself,
and not Rolph.

584
01:02:39,302 --> 01:02:41,497
You were a soldier.

585
01:02:41,662 --> 01:02:46,019
You had every right
to try to get home alive.

586
01:03:09,062 --> 01:03:10,256
Matt!

587
01:03:10,422 --> 01:03:14,017
- Maybe I'd better learn to knock.
- Come in, Cass.

588
01:03:16,102 --> 01:03:18,741
Who'd you like to try next? Jamie?

589
01:03:19,582 --> 01:03:23,211
Major! We're gonna need his gun
to get out of here.

590
01:03:24,742 --> 01:03:26,539
Get out.

591
01:03:54,422 --> 01:03:56,492
Leave it alone, Rolph!

592
01:03:58,262 --> 01:04:00,730
Drop it, Rolph. Drop it!

593
01:04:30,622 --> 01:04:32,021
He tried to kill you.

594
01:04:45,462 --> 01:04:47,054
Look out!

595
01:05:04,062 --> 01:05:06,018
You took a big chance there.

596
01:05:06,182 --> 01:05:09,731
Well, when I had that noose
around my neck out there...

597
01:05:09,902 --> 01:05:12,291
...I sort of give myself up for dead.

598
01:05:13,422 --> 01:05:15,697
Guess I ain't over it yet.

599
01:05:20,822 --> 01:05:22,733
- We're gonna burn them out!
- Yeah.

600
01:05:22,902 --> 01:05:25,177
Start filling that wood!

601
01:05:36,942 --> 01:05:39,410
That ought to hold it down.

602
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:42,899
Where's that storm we paid you for?

603
01:05:54,422 --> 01:05:56,413
I've been wondering
when they'd do that.

604
01:05:56,662 --> 01:05:59,540
- Jamie, get some buckets.
- I'll get you some.

605
01:05:59,702 --> 01:06:02,421
I concluded not to be neutral,
if it's okay with you.

606
01:06:02,582 --> 01:06:04,652
Fine with me.

607
01:06:04,822 --> 01:06:06,733
Jamie, help me with this.

608
01:06:08,862 --> 01:06:12,537
We've gotta get rid of some gold.
If they don't find it, you'll be safe.

609
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:16,377
Don't worry. Nobody's gonna touch it.
It's going back where it come from.

610
01:06:16,542 --> 01:06:18,737
Cass, untie him.

611
01:06:19,582 --> 01:06:23,575
You so much as bat an eye,
I'll shoot it right out of your head.

612
01:06:23,742 --> 01:06:26,540
Come on, get over there.

613
01:06:30,262 --> 01:06:34,301
You can't stay here, ma'am.
You gotta get over there by the door.

614
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:40,173
Look out, major!

615
01:07:54,422 --> 01:07:56,174
He's dead.

616
01:08:03,062 --> 01:08:05,337
Aren't you going to let us
out of here?

617
01:08:05,502 --> 01:08:09,381
If we can stay it out, we will. If not,
I'll get you out in time. All of you.

618
01:08:09,542 --> 01:08:12,136
Well, at least untie my hands.

619
01:08:14,742 --> 01:08:17,210
Cass, help me with Egan.

620
01:08:33,622 --> 01:08:36,739
Don't shoot!
They were holding me in there!

621
01:08:56,662 --> 01:08:59,051
All right, we go now,
out the back window.

622
01:08:59,222 --> 01:09:02,419
Wait. We gotta scatter their horses,
or we won't have a chance.

623
01:09:02,582 --> 01:09:05,938
You won't have a chance of doing that,
either. Come on, get ready.

624
01:09:23,022 --> 01:09:25,138
We'll be gone in a minute.

625
01:09:25,302 --> 01:09:27,532
- I don't want this to end here.
- But it will.

626
01:09:27,702 --> 01:09:31,058
No matter how you got that gold,
if you take it, you're an outlaw.

627
01:09:31,222 --> 01:09:34,771
I know, but I intend to get it home.
Then I'm coming north to find you.

628
01:09:34,942 --> 01:09:38,901
Then don't take it. Don't go on
fighting a war that's already over.

629
01:09:39,062 --> 01:09:41,018
Where will I find you?

630
01:09:41,982 --> 01:09:45,292
You'd better go.
These storms last only a few minutes.

631
01:09:45,462 --> 01:09:47,692
- You've got to...
- Major.

632
01:09:48,502 --> 01:09:50,618
Cass, he's gone.

633
01:11:09,302 --> 01:11:13,011
- Over there!
- Get going!

634
01:11:25,542 --> 01:11:27,533
Check that room in there.

635
01:11:28,022 --> 01:11:29,296
All right, where is it?

636
01:11:29,462 --> 01:11:32,898
If you mean gold,
they didn't have none with them.

637
01:11:44,102 --> 01:11:45,774
Fletch! Who's over there?

638
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:47,735
Fletch!

639
01:11:47,902 --> 01:11:50,132
Hey, Smitty!

640
01:11:51,022 --> 01:11:53,741
- Smitty!
- Take it easy. I'm over here.

641
01:11:53,902 --> 01:11:55,813
Where are you guys?

642
01:11:57,702 --> 01:11:59,215
Quince!

643
01:12:00,022 --> 01:12:01,774
Let's go!

644
01:12:01,942 --> 01:12:04,251
Maybe we won't have to!

645
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,174
Nothing in there.

646
01:12:14,782 --> 01:12:16,818
You was in that coach, wasn't you?

647
01:12:16,982 --> 01:12:20,497
- Yes, I was.
- Then where's the gold?

648
01:12:20,662 --> 01:12:22,937
Probably right where
they said it was.

649
01:12:23,102 --> 01:12:24,660
They didn't have it with them.

650
01:12:24,822 --> 01:12:28,019
She's telling the truth. Let's go.

651
01:12:28,622 --> 01:12:30,738
All right, let's go.

652
01:12:42,062 --> 01:12:44,212
How many you got left?

653
01:12:45,062 --> 01:12:47,576
You heard me.
Where did the rest of you go?

654
01:12:47,742 --> 01:12:49,573
Take a look!

655
01:12:57,382 --> 01:13:01,136
Come on, you can take us! There must
be three of you left, maybe four.

656
01:13:06,702 --> 01:13:09,774
Let's go.
They'll get that gold before us.

657
01:13:22,902 --> 01:13:25,177
They must have been
telling the truth.

658
01:13:27,382 --> 01:13:30,374
Quince! Hey, Quincey!

659
01:13:31,382 --> 01:13:35,057
Shut up! Do you want everybody
after that gold?

660
01:13:35,222 --> 01:13:36,814
Hey, Quincey!

661
01:13:36,982 --> 01:13:38,734
Come on.

662
01:13:53,102 --> 01:13:55,696
You dirty, double-cross...

663
01:14:54,182 --> 01:14:55,581
Whoa.

664
01:14:56,022 --> 01:14:58,820
Whoa. Whoa.

665
01:14:58,982 --> 01:15:01,416
Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy. Whoa.

666
01:15:04,902 --> 01:15:07,132
Stop! Whoa!

667
01:15:44,342 --> 01:15:45,900
Molly.

668
01:16:03,542 --> 01:16:06,056
Hurry up, Pa,
they might come back.

669
01:16:12,342 --> 01:16:14,253
I guess you were right, Molly.

670
01:16:14,422 --> 01:16:16,617
The war is over.

671
01:16:26,102 --> 01:16:28,332
They're coach horses, son.
We got no saddles.

672
01:16:28,502 --> 01:16:31,414
Don't need one. You'll find two more
gold bags over there.

673
01:16:31,582 --> 01:16:35,177
- Better put them with the rest.
- Now that you ain't rich no more...

674
01:16:35,942 --> 01:16:38,331
...maybe you'd consider
coming back this way.

675
01:16:40,102 --> 01:16:43,378
- Coming back?
- Nobody knows you here.

676
01:16:43,542 --> 01:16:45,373
You could come back
in a few months.

677
01:16:45,942 --> 01:16:50,572
And the land's good.
Over 300 acres of it.

678
01:16:51,662 --> 01:16:55,052
- Well, I...
- I'd... I'd share it with you.

679
01:16:55,222 --> 01:16:57,452
And there's some
mighty good hunting too.

680
01:17:00,502 --> 01:17:02,220
If you'd...

681
01:17:02,382 --> 01:17:04,452
...like to come back...

682
01:17:04,982 --> 01:17:07,621
...you'd be welcome, son.

683
01:17:08,342 --> 01:17:10,617
I'm obliged to you, ma'am.

684
01:17:10,782 --> 01:17:12,738
I'd like to come back.

685
01:17:20,422 --> 01:17:22,413
Don't worry about us, Molly.

686
01:17:22,582 --> 01:17:25,619
This Indian token
is our passage home.
