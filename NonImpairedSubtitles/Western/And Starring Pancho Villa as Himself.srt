1
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,798
More, more, Mr. Walsh.
You got to kill them all.

2
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:34,536
The last thing in the world you'd want is
to be captured by those heathen redskins.

3
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,281
Rush to him, Miss Sampson.
Rush to your protector.

4
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,583
Seek the shelter of his manly arms.

5
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,716
True love, Adrian.

6
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,318
True love laced with heartrending,
devotional gratitude.

7
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,652
And cut.

8
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,196
Cut, everybody.

9
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,493
- Next setup, Charlie.
- Yes, Mr. Griffith.

10
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:00,866
Go get those horses.

11
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,900
I know you're freezing. We're all freezing.

12
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:12,951
There he is, Frank.

13
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,754
Ask him over, gently.

14
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,750
Very good, my dear. Very good, indeed.

15
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,294
Mr. Griffith, sir...

16
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,361
Mr. Aitken's in the car.
He'd like to have a word with you.

17
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,128
- Duffy, how are we with Mr. Walsh?
- Hello.

18
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,193
A bit higher than usual.

19
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,431
How about there?

20
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,939
Be more generous with the blood.
Lay it on thick.

21
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,408
He's over there, sir.
Says that it's important.

22
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:40,571
When will Mr. Aitken understand
that when Griffith is filming...

23
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:43,275
nothing is of greater importance
to Griffith?

24
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,387
Sorry, David,
but we need to move fast on this...

25
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,424
if you think it's worth moving at all.

26
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,551
Eli Morton in our Texas office...

27
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,460
went for some kind of press conference
over the border...

28
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,623
pulled together
by this Pancho Villa fellow...

29
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,360
- Villa.
- The Pancho Villa?

30
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,197
Right. According to Eli...

31
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:06,932
Villa is offering exclusive rights
to any motion-picture company...

32
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,702
interested in filming
his revolutionary army...

33
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,176
- with the vision <i>del norte...</i>
<i>- Del norte.</i>

34
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:16,073
...in action against the federal forces of,
who he calls...

35
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,414
the despotic President of Mexico,
Victorio...

36
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,147
- Victoriano Huerta.
- Huerta, right.

37
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,889
Villa's terms as follows.

38
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:27,517
He's asking for $25,000 in advance
against 20% of the profits.

39
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,993
- He wants the money in gold.
- Quite the horse trader.

40
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,463
He's supposed to be some kind of Injun
or something.

41
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,557
He's mestizo. It's a racial mix.

42
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,328
Where'd you get all that stuff?

43
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:40,532
Is it worth a shot? No story, no actors.
Just shooting an actual military scrap.

44
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,575
- Just that, and that alone.
- Just filming men at war?

45
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,406
Being allowed to place cameras
in the thick of battle?

46
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,141
This may prove as much a revolution
for motion pictures...

47
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,582
- as the one Villa is waging on the ground.
- Real death, real blood.

48
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:55,086
People will get sick to their stomachs
with that show.

49
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,451
Hold it a minute, Harry.

50
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,880
Give her your gloves, will you?

51
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:00,884
Excuse me.

52
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,060
- Miss Sampson.
- Hello.

53
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,792
I'm Frank Thayer.
I'm with the Mutual Company.

54
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,767
Mr. Griffith said that...

55
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,634
You're in charge of gloves, are you?

56
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,510
Harry, thousands of words could be used
to describe individual achievements.

57
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,947
But the historian's pen
over time will be no match...

58
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,917
for the image the moviemaker captures
in the eye of his camera.

59
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:30,149
20% of the profits for some guy
who's never done a movie before.

60
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,622
There's not a day that passes...

61
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,888
when this guy is not featured
on the front pages of the world press.

62
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,590
The man is a star. And stars
are the mother's milk of box office.

63
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,991
You wouldn't consider going down there
and try getting us a better deal?

64
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,971
A bird hasn't been bought yet that
D. W. Griffith couldn't charm down a tree.

65
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,032
Be serious. If all I've got to do
is setting up the California studio...

66
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,475
Just how competent would you say he is?

67
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,708
You think he's ready
to do something useful?

68
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,980
- Who? Who are we talking about?
- Your nephew.

69
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,352
Who, Frank?

70
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,184
Anyone else bidding on the rights?

71
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,486
- Hand me those.
- Thanks.

72
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,919
Any other movie companies
showing an interest that you know of?

73
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,556
We got the inside track.

74
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,363
Money does a whole lot of talking
around here...

75
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,537
- and the heavier it is, the better it's heard.
- Right.

76
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,664
You gotta keep your wits about you
around here.

77
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,073
- Yes, sir.
- First, number one thing to remember:

78
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:27,237
When you meet him,
never look Villa straight in the eye.

79
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,679
You forget that,
you wake up deader than a doornail.

80
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,808
And making any sudden moves
around him...

81
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,580
that's another real good way
to get your scalp creased.

82
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,350
When do we actually meet?
What's the plan?

83
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,288
Villa calls the shots.

84
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:43,260
Gotta work out how to slip over the
border and find out wherever he's hiding.

85
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,661
We have to be smuggled into Mexico?

86
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:48,131
There ain't no "we" in that equation,
Mr. Thayer.

87
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,034
Eli Morton has got a wife and kids
to think about.

88
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,401
- That's not gunfire, is it?
- Step right this way, Mr. Thayer.

89
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,503
Let's get you boys a ringside seat
at the Revolution.

90
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,277
Come on up.

91
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:10,183
The chairs are in there. Come on, fellows.
Let's get a look.

92
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,414
Let's go up to the front, come on.

93
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,886
Let's go right up here. Excuse us for a sec.

94
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,122
Colonel, how're you doing?
Do you mind? Thanks.

95
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:20,165
These guys are from back East.
They've never seen... Thank you.

96
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,962
Come here, step right up.

97
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,362
There you go.

98
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:35,973
Thank you.

99
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:50,057
Feels almost like watching a show
from up here, doesn't it?

100
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,055
Well, it's a bit more than playacting, sir.

101
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,793
What you're watching is a dictatorship
in the throes of dying.

102
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,894
Yielding up one life at a time.

103
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,301
John Reed, <i>Metropolitan</i> magazine.

104
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,503
Frank Thayer, Mutual Film Company.

105
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:09,047
You're taking the bait, Mr. Thayer?
You're going to film the battle?

106
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,309
I'm going to try.

107
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,476
Have a peek at your picture show.

108
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,703
- It's my turn.
- Don't push.

109
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,973
Look at that. To your left.

110
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,738
Hope you don't have any stock
in Doheny Oil, Mr. Thayer.

111
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,145
Oh, God.

112
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:47,913
Shows you what Pancho Villa thinks
of Americans owning Mexican oil.

113
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,018
The bastard doesn't care
whose property he burns.

114
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,956
There he is.
There's your bloody Robin Hood of Mexico.

115
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,431
What's he doing?
He's only taken half the town.

116
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,346
- It's off to bed, fellows.
- Good night, Frank.

117
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,288
- Get some sleep.
- Yeah.

118
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,833
Wait. I've never been on a horse.

119
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,768
You will like it.

120
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,363
Come on.

121
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,514
He wants to know why the movies
sent him such a clown.

122
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,786
He wants to know was Charlie Chaplin
too busy to show up down here?

123
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:44,060
- He wants to know...
- Griffith wanted to come. He truly did.

124
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,189
Only, he's kind of involved right now.

125
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,393
And this guy's
just fucking around down here, right?

126
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,476
He says he don't trust nobody
who don't look him straight in the eye.

127
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,947
I was told that he would kill a man
for doing that.

128
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:07,816
That's a pile of crap. They don't stop
telling stories about this guy.

129
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,653
- What's that all over your tie?
- It's my school emblem.

130
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,022
My college's.

131
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,295
To which college do you go?

132
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,998
Did, sir. Harvard in Boston.

133
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,641
<i>Sí.</i> That's the school
where you make presidents. <i>Sí?</i>

134
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,674
A few have attended, yes, sir.

135
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,043
One day...

136
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:38,876
Pancho Villa will send his son
to Boston, Harvard.

137
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,154
He says he's knocked out enough sons
to fill every college in America.

138
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,064
Is that the gold?

139
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:58,533
Cash would have been a whole lot lighter,
I can assure you.

140
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:03,337
Last person who tried to give cash, Pancho
cleaned up his glasses with a bullet.

141
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,740
- Your <i>contrato?</i>
- Yes, sir. It's right here, sir.

142
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:10,973
Those are the glasses.

143
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,246
One for you, one for me.

144
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,694
Those actresses you work with,
they're like nurses, right?

145
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,032
They got to have it all the time,
don't they?

146
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,594
I'm not sure that's really true.

147
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:37,073
Yeah, right. Like you're not
jazzing your brains out, are you?

148
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,037
What?

149
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,053
What's this 10% of the profits bullshit?
His cut's supposed to be 20%.

150
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:54,092
You lie to Pancho Villa,
you go back to Harvard in a box!

151
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,789
Sir, that is a mistake. Somebody must've
changed figures before I had a chance...

152
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,500
It's just my pen.

153
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,531
<i>El plumo,</i> or whatever you call it.

154
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,978
Let me change all these 10s here
into 20s, okay?

155
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,375
Here we are. Fixed.

156
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,950
20%, 20%, 20%, 20%.

157
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,452
See, you gotta understand.
He needs the money.

158
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,489
With Wilson's goddamn embargo...

159
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,751
you gotta go the black-market route
to get guns.

160
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:29,555
It costs an arm and a leg
to kill somebody down here.

161
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,293
No, please.

162
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,533
This pen has gone to college.

163
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,102
It's for your son. Any of your sons.

164
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,405
But your <i>Señor</i> Hearst...

165
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:54,182
he only writes bad words
about Pancho Villa in <i>sus periódicos.</i>

166
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,652
In his newspapers.

167
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,653
People, I think...

168
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:02,860
they believe more what they see
on the picture screen.

169
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:07,426
When your President Wilson
sees my movie...

170
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,057
he will know
he must support Pancho Villa.

171
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,031
He will see that Pancho Villa
is a good guy.

172
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,096
That he's not like <i>Presidente</i> Huerta.

173
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,775
- That donkey fucker.
- Yeah, got it.

174
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,491
I hope he's not gonna be offended.
I'm not much of a drinker.

175
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,359
Don't worry about it.
He never touches the stuff.

176
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,265
You are Frank.

177
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,991
- That's your name?
- Frank Thayer, yes, sir.

178
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:48,105
Pancho is also Frank. Pancho is Francisco.

179
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,868
That's his real moniker.

180
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:56,110
Tell me, what would you like,
Francisco Two?

181
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,273
Lemon, vanilla.

182
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,519
Thank you.

183
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,100
I've never seen anyone like him.

184
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,328
There is nobody like him, sonny boy.

185
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:20,201
If there was,
he would blow their brains out.

186
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,609
- How do we do this?
- You got a plan, Frank?

187
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,269
Besides praying a lot.

188
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:31,043
I think you all just fan out.
Catch whatever you can.

189
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,650
Other than bullets, you mean.

190
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,092
Those crazy bastards are not gonna last
10 minutes out there.

191
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:54,361
Gentlemen, the Mutual Film Company
is about to make history.

192
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:58,334
Thanks to an exclusive arrangement
with Gen. Pancho Villa...

193
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,901
who joins such illustrious Mutual artists...

194
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,641
as Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford,
and Fatty Arbuckle...

195
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,979
the public will, for the very first time...

196
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:09,953
be treated to the thrills and chills
of an actual battlefield...

197
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,786
as seen through the lens
of the motion picture camera.

198
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:39,244
Are you worried about the physical danger
your people might be exposed to?

199
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:43,015
Gen. Villa has assigned
his crack guards, his <i>dorados...</i>

200
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,921
that's D-O-R-A-D-O-S...

201
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:49,323
to guarantee the safety of each
and every one of our camera operators.

202
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,622
Set up in the doorway. Hurry!

203
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,389
Turn around and film the gunner.

204
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,838
Sir, you must be really devoted
to this cause!

205
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:11,948
For $1,000 a month, there's nothing
Sam Drebben can't get devoted to.

206
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,008
Plus all the gold teeth I can pull.

207
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,582
Watch your ass, sonny boy.

208
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,594
Another day, another dollar.

209
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,671
Hearst Publications.

210
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:37,008
You don't have any qualms
about manipulating public opinion...

211
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,635
in favor of a man
many people consider to be...

212
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:42,339
nothing more than
a socialist rabble-rouser?

213
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,245
Unlike your employer Mr. Hearst...

214
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:48,150
this company has no interest whatever
in meddling in politics...

215
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,710
foreign or domestic.

216
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:53,717
For the millions he's trying to free
of a cruel dictatorship...

217
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,090
Pancho Villa hardly needs Mutual's help...

218
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,392
to enhance his reputation
as the George Washington of Mexico.

219
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,415
Bloody hell!

220
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,128
Francisco, you're not dead yet?

221
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,390
Still alive, sir.

222
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,653
These are just civilians, aren't they?

223
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,888
Yeah. You make the mistake
of supporting Pancho Villa...

224
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,089
you wind up being a tree ornament.

225
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:09,890
Saves ammunition.

226
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,827
That one's mine.

227
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:25,943
Next patient.

228
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:22,127
The kid's gonna have a playmate soon.
Somebody knocked her up.

229
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,368
- That figures.
- What?

230
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,441
The Father's the father.

231
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:46,523
He's swearing to take care of the kid and
the baby however long they need it for.

232
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:16,843
Hi, Charlie.

233
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:22,887
Good work, Frank.
You didn't get in my way once.

234
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,392
Thank you, Hennie.

235
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,528
And how did it feel today, Mr. Thayer?

236
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,696
Being smack in the middle
of the killing ground.

237
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:34,235
It's shameful to admit
how exciting I found it.

238
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,866
That's strictly a survivor's sensation.

239
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:40,008
Someone else's death
serving as your own reprieve.

240
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,973
You're in good company, Mr. Thayer.

241
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,806
Shamelessness has a big following
down here.

242
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:50,945
Bank robbers, painters, poets,
soldiers of fortune.

243
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,356
Enough anarchists to blow up Wall Street
10 times over.

244
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,322
Healing Jews and fighting Jews.

245
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:58,794
Maurice Grossbaum,
a surgeon from Indiana.

246
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,855
Sam Drebben,
machine-gunner from the Bronx.

247
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,529
Gen. Ángeles came over
from the <i>Federales.</i>

248
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:10,297
Studied von Clausewitz,
well-read, an idealist.

249
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:13,376
He's the other side of the peso
to Gen. Fierro.

250
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:17,606
He gets really ugly unless he kills
at least one prisoner before breakfast.

251
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,684
From the merely curious
to the merely morbid.

252
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,520
All of this on Villa's order.

253
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,653
All of this in Villa's thrall.

254
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:56,586
You take home a nice <i>recuerdo,</i>
<i>verdad, amigo?</i> A souvenir.

255
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,646
But be careful...

256
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:02,860
should they give you
some crawly souvenir in your underwear.

257
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,510
Her husband got killed
in the fighting today.

258
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,336
And her youngest son, too.

259
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,347
Get this.

260
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,121
He just gave her more money
than her old man saw in his entire life.

261
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:45,259
What will they think,
my American friends...

262
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,828
when they see the movie of Pancho Villa?

263
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:51,101
I think Mr. Doheny
is gonna be very impressed indeed.

264
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,280
He worships the ground that is Mexico.

265
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,681
Doheny worships what's underneath it.

266
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:06,086
Your <i>Señor</i> Hearst
is also <i>muy nervioso. Siéntense.</i>

267
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,022
Very nervous.

268
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:11,256
You know how much
he owns of Mexico, Francisco?

269
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,722
<i>Señor</i> Hearst. You know how many acres?

270
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,832
More like 8 million.

271
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,525
8 million acres?

272
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,531
How many head of cattle
have you stolen from him? 60,000, he says.

273
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:26,309
You are <i>loco, Juanito.</i> 60,000.

274
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:30,371
50,000, maybe. Maybe 50,000 at most.

275
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:35,145
So, Francisco, today was not too...

276
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:41,423
- Boring.
- Boring. It was not too boring?

277
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:44,586
You became more a man a little,
I think, today.

278
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,488
- Maybe you and your <i>amigos...</i>
- Yeah, I'd say we had a good start.

279
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,034
Today I think they found,
a little bit, their <i>huevos.</i>

280
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,798
Even though a few of them got a little wet.

281
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:56,932
Yes.

282
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:12,751
You will help.

283
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,193
You'll help Americans know
that hope does not stop at the border.

284
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:24,132
It's my Virgin of Guadalupe.

285
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,337
I'm deeply honored, sir.

286
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,207
He says you should be.

287
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:36,238
You've got the only virgin left around here.

288
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,793
Please bear in mind
that our camera operators...

289
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,992
had to constantly deal
with movement of men and horses...

290
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:59,559
exploding bombs, clouds of gunpowder.

291
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,068
But what you're looking at is,
without a doubt...

292
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,634
never-before-seen footage of live action
shot on an actual field of battle.

293
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:09,771
Never-before-seen footage?
You still can't see it.

294
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:19,421
They'd have bit the dust a lot better
if D.W. Griffith had directed it.

295
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:25,088
Let me assure you that every one of these
men and women, and every child...

296
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,427
died in the very best way that they could.

297
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:34,168
There he is, boys, on motion-picture film
for all the world to see:

298
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,036
Gen. Pancho Villa.

299
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,597
<i>Despite its technical flaws...</i>

300
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:09,902
clearly more people
would discover Pancho Villa...

301
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,238
from a few feet of this crude,
historic film...

302
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,938
than from the reams that are written
about his struggle...

303
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,914
to rid Mexico of its greedy robber barons...

304
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,450
the only ones to profit
from their cozy marriage...

305
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,645
with rapacious American interests.

306
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,054
Unfortunately, not everyone happens to be
the socialist-lover that John Reed is.

307
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:30,961
Hearst, no surprise,
is putting our nuts through a wringer.

308
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,254
Pardon me.

309
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,032
With all he's got invested in Mexico...

310
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:38,034
<i>Hearst stands to lose</i>
<i>one or two of his fortunes down there.</i>

311
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:41,469
Speak up, Harry. We're
a whole country apart, for God's sake.

312
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:42,733
<i>Listen to this:</i>

313
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:45,241
<i>"Pandering to Villa 's overblown vanity...</i>

314
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,177
<i>"the perpetrators</i>
<i>of this clumsy excuse of a film..."</i>

315
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,612
"...clearly demonstrate
they were more interested...

316
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,616
"in selling tickets to a gullible public...

317
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,447
"than in telling the real truth..."

318
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,146
I'll take the pastrami on rye.

319
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,689
"...the real truth
about the self-styled Gen. Villa...

320
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:02,248
"and his ragtag army with nary
a piece of modern artillery to its name."

321
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,795
Lt'd be more productive
for you to read the want ads.

322
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,923
You know what's so galling about all this?
It's all true.

323
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,024
We had so little control
over what happened.

324
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:13,229
Villa comes off as some kind of simple,
starstruck cowboy.

325
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:14,532
Give me the strudel.

326
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,541
We didn't offer a clue to his complexity,
to his greatness.

327
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,406
What a movie that would make.

328
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:23,345
This would all be better said
to someone with a checkbook, wouldn't it?

329
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,674
He's been beaten and tortured all his life.

330
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,481
They say that he still has whip scars
across his back.

331
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,682
He was a convict before he turned 20.

332
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:33,849
It's midnight.

333
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:37,088
Before he was 12,
he was already being hunted by the law.

334
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:40,128
Now there are places in Mexico
where he is the law.

335
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,189
Don't make me fire you twice in one week.

336
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:45,930
He's the James Boys, he's Billy the Kid,
he's Napoleon...

337
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,232
all rolled into one.

338
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:51,036
But he asks nothing for himself.
He takes nothing.

339
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:55,109
He builds schools where there were none.
He seizes the homes of the wealthy.

340
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:58,273
He redistributes the land.
He gives it to the poor. He feeds them.

341
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,249
He even prints his own money.

342
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:03,179
Prints his own money?
The man's not all bad, is he?

343
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,553
Tell me that this material would not make
a fantastic moving picture.

344
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:09,616
Forget it.
The <i>Times</i> said the one we made...

345
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:13,130
Iooked like a high-school play
that couldn't afford the costumes.

346
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:16,792
For my money, and that's sure as hell
what every penny of it was...

347
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,302
we gave Pancho Villa more than his shot.

348
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,897
- But we didn't. That's the whole point.
- Be realistic.

349
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:26,603
You'd never crowd all that stuff
into a two-reeler, not in a million years.

350
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,578
I'd make it more like seven.

351
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,044
- Seven reels?
- Seven reels.

352
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:35,176
Did you smoke some of that funny stuff
down in Mexico, Frank?

353
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,743
Who in their right minds...

354
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:40,086
is gonna wanna sit through a movie
that runs for over an hour?

355
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:43,127
There's never a first until someone tries.

356
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,955
Don't give me fortune cookies
in the middle of the night, Frank.

357
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,123
And seven reels is a whale of a show...

358
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,998
you're ready to give away
for a nickel a ticket.

359
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,903
Then double it.

360
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,632
Double it?

361
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,737
- A dime a ticket?
- A dime a ticket.

362
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:03,070
One good first deserves another.

363
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,645
- These are exciting thoughts, Frank.
- They are.

364
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:11,818
- I'm definitely getting excited.
- Don't let me stop you.

365
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,092
If only they didn't all look
so crummy down there.

366
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,664
For 10 cents,
people are gonna wanna see a lot more...

367
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:23,599
than a bunch of barefoot buggers
jumping around in the cactus.

368
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,193
We can help them look better.
I know we can.

369
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:29,195
I have to run this past D.W., of course.

370
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:33,102
He'll see the possibilities in a minute.
I promise you.

371
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,543
<i>The Life of General Villa.</i>

372
00:33:58,403 --> 00:33:59,392
Okay.

373
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,498
Hey, you moron, watch the vase!

374
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,854
- Hello, sir.
- Francisco Two.

375
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:48,726
- Do I know you were coming?
- I sent a telegram.

376
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,866
When I see it,
then I will know you are here.

377
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,401
- I missed you many times, <i>mi amigo.</i>
- I've missed you.

378
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,964
Yeah, good. <i>Bueno.</i>

379
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:00,533
The Virgin, does she answer your prayers?

380
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,846
Not with my Spanish, she doesn't.

381
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:07,611
It's not Spanish. Never Spanish. <i>Mexicano.</i>

382
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:11,711
There are two things
Spain give to my people:

383
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:14,554
The church and the weapon.

384
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,154
You should write a book.

385
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,291
Maybe I have to read one or two first.

386
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,938
This is the battle?

387
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,045
So much there.

388
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,242
Two little circles.

389
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,515
Magic.

390
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,286
Tomorrow, we must liberate
a projector somewhere.

391
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,389
Tell me are you hungry, thirsty?

392
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,226
House of great wealth.

393
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,128
Not one drop of ice cream.

394
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:09,772
If my father saw us here,
me and my brother, he would say:

395
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:13,112
Before your head grows a boot.

396
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:16,781
A room like this.

397
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,550
Such a room could be only for a don.

398
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,659
Or for a foreigner.

399
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:30,460
Into a room like this,
my father could only crawl...

400
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,095
to beg for some food for himself,
for his family.

401
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:41,502
There are books here
that weigh more than he did when he died.

402
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,846
Welcome back to Mexico.

403
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:07,835
- Are you all right, Francisco?
- Yes, thanks.

404
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,805
Is the horse riding you well?

405
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,340
You did not come all this way...

406
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:17,643
- only to bring me my film, right?
- Right.

407
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:27,219
Another movie? You want to make
another movie with Pancho Villa?

408
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,919
Yes, sir. Same deal as last time.
Same money.

409
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,289
Your President Wilson
has lifted the arms embargo.

410
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,798
Money is not a problem
for Pancho Villa anymore.

411
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,934
Tell me, has there ever been
a movie of Don Quixote, do you know?

412
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,570
No, not that I know of. No, sir.

413
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,278
Not one movie of Don Quixote?

414
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:52,411
And <i>Señor</i> Aitken wants to make
two of Pancho Villa.

415
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:56,180
We believe that this story,
this photoplay...

416
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,244
will greatly enhance your popularity...

417
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:01,018
and it's gonna go a long way
to helping the Revolution.

418
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,719
You still have a lot of enemies
in high places though.

419
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:07,787
Yeah. That's the best place for enemies,
high up where you can see them.

420
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,628
You'd be doing me a very big favor.

421
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:14,000
Remember Don Quixote, <i>mi amigo.</i>

422
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,336
A man must not fight windmills.

423
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:29,978
<i>Villa positively not interested.</i>

424
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,880
<i>Returning New York immediately.</i>

425
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,658
<i>Awfully sorry. Did my level best.</i>

426
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,384
<i>Frank N. Thayer.</i>

427
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,060
"N" for "nephew."

428
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,025
You're welcome.

429
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:14,659
Don't give me that happy-peon lark.
You're on my land.

430
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:16,626
You and the other bloody <i>bandidos...</i>

431
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,761
think you can just ride off here
with my horses and my guns, <i>amigo?</i>

432
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,227
No.

433
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:27,308
Soldiers of Pancho Villa are no <i>bandidos.</i>

434
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:32,976
You've been robbing me blind
and you bloody well know it.

435
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,847
Five thousand head of my cattle...

436
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,149
and not so much as
one bloody fucking peso.

437
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,620
Thank you very much.

438
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:42,989
These tinhorn bean-ocrats down here
may put up with the crap you dish out.

439
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,628
But you've finished shitting
on this white man. <i>Comprende?</i>

440
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:27,156
<i>Did you read Hearst today?</i>

Does the General have any questions?

It's <i>muy simple.</i>

460
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,533
Very good, sir.

461
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:47,566
"In the event that a major exchange
cannot be filmed...

462
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:51,506
"you will agree to restage such battles,
or stage new ones as may be necessary...

463
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:54,009
"for the benefit
of the Mutual Company's cameras.

464
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:57,137
"For its part, the Mutual Company
agrees to furnish wardrobe..."

465
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:08,980
Problem?

466
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:12,586
He wants to make sure
Frank's gonna be working on this one, too.

467
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:15,631
No Francisco, no Francisco.

468
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:18,558
I promise you, General...

469
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:22,901
this fine young man is gonna be with you
every damn <i>momentum</i> of the day.

470
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:26,267
Whatever you need, whatever you want,
this is gonna be your man.

471
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,208
Every bit as he's gonna be mine.

472
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:32,171
It's right here, sir.

473
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:38,421
$25,000, as before.

474
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:41,056
I take it we have a deal, sir.

475
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:46,891
The soldiers of Pancho Villa...

476
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:50,593
have left behind many <i>huérfanos y viudas.</i>

477
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,093
Lots of widows and orphans.

478
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,899
He's up to his ass in them.

479
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:57,967
They are very sad. They're very poor.

480
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,736
The General is most sensitive.

481
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:06,413
A leader must be <i>muy</i> sensitive.

482
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,551
You must give to Pancho Villa,
when into Mexico City...

483
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,652
after the Revolution...

484
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:20,360
- A print?
- A print.

485
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,723
He wants his own print.

486
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:27,630
I think he wants to have
his own premiere here.

487
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,864
Pancho Villa, too, needs nickels.

488
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:35,569
Many nickels for those who lost so much...

489
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:38,877
and for those who lost so many.

490
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:43,912
I will be very happy to write that
into the agreement this very minute, sir.

491
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:48,023
<i>No es necesario,</i> my good sir.

492
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:51,753
For Pancho Villa, your hand is your word.

493
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:57,296
Certainly. Of course.

494
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:00,094
It's my pleasure, sir.

495
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:00,620
- Hiya, Duffy.
- Hey, Frank.

496
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:03,564
- Everything okay? Nice to see you.
- At least we made it.

497
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,796
Hi, Charlie, how are you?

498
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:12,004
- Where's the Scotch, Frank?
- Didn't you bring it?

499
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:14,467
I see you've got gloves this time.

500
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:17,208
- Welcome to Mexico.
- Thank you.

501
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,748
Gen. Villa...

502
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:29,425
please allow me to introduce our director.

503
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:31,859
This is Mr. William Christy Cabanne.

504
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,390
I am so looking forward, sir.

505
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:39,229
And this is Miss Teddy Sampson
who will play the role of your sister.

506
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:46,240
And this is Miss Irene Hunt
who will be your mother.

507
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:57,147
And Charlie Rositer of course you know
from Ojinaga.

508
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:59,586
Are your <i>huevos</i> all dry now, Charlie?

509
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:00,986
For the moment.

510
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,627
And this, sir, is Mr. Raoul Walsh.

511
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:07,954
General.

512
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:10,431
He'll be playing the young Pancho Villa.

513
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,227
Tell me, Raoul Walsh...

514
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:15,530
you know even
which end of the horse shits?

515
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,137
You can be me.

516
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:29,005
Okay, Carl, camera. And action.

517
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:33,340
And say goodbye, Mom.

518
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:37,083
Very nice, yes.
Sis, go get you a little of that.

519
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,281
And lovely. Okay.

520
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:44,692
And it's farewell, Pancho. Let's go.

521
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:46,952
And he goes.

522
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,034
And cut! Okay.

523
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,362
Very nice.

524
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:57,703
Little more of a routine goodbye, Raoul.

525
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:01,176
Listen, your character
has no way of knowing...

526
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:03,474
what tragic events the day's gonna bring.

527
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:06,778
- So keep it big, make it small, okay?
- Christy, I want...

528
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:10,217
Adrian, give me a wee bit less.
Just hearts, no flowers.

529
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:11,276
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

530
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,514
<i>Uno más,</i> people.

531
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:17,050
As <i>pronto</i> as possible <i>por favor,</i> makeup.
Okay, let's go, people.

532
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:21,090
- I was just thinking that maybe...
- No, don't think, darling. Just act.

533
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:23,062
Let's just make a movie here.

534
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:26,432
That's enough, okay?
Look, he's a Mexican. Mexicans sweat.

535
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,094
He's fine. Leave him alone.

536
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,662
- Carl, crank them.
- Okay.

537
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,809
And from the kiss, <i>por favor.</i>

538
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,974
And action.

539
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:39,681
Much better. And sis...

540
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:41,172
Lovely.

541
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:43,816
Okay, and farewell, Pancho.

542
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:46,654
Off he goes. Goodbye, Pancho.

543
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,451
That's good.
One last look at Mom and Sis. A fond look.

544
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:52,152
Fond!

545
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:56,027
You love them. Good.
Wham-bam, out the door.

546
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,094
And, perfect!

547
00:53:58,368 --> 00:53:59,960
Cut, print. Beautiful!

548
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,363
Next setup.

549
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:06,374
<i>"Unquestionably the most expensive and</i>
<i>longest motion picture contemplated. "</i>

550
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:09,372
<i>So reads</i>
<i>the Mutual Film Company publicity.</i>

551
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:12,277
<i>An unprecedented seven 15-minute reels...</i>

552
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:15,746
<i>two of which will be filmed</i>
<i>during the upcoming battle of Torreón...</i>

553
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:18,344
<i>for which Villa 's forces are now preparing.</i>

554
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,551
<i>Mutual Company promises</i>
<i>an additional 5 reels...</i>

555
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:28,063
<i>devoted to a specially written photoplay:</i>

556
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:31,532
The Factual Story
of the Heroic Life of Pancho Villa.

557
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,933
Every page is a page of lies.

558
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,177
I don't understand.

559
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:44,175
<i>Mierda</i> means "shit."

560
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,905
I know that.
I just don't know why you say that...

561
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:51,420
"Pancho Villa becomes an outlaw when
the <i>Federales</i> take away his father's land."

562
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:54,649
The land of Pancho Villa's father
was his grave!

563
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:58,023
Mr. Aitken feels that's more colorful.
That's only dramatic license.

564
00:54:58,094 --> 00:54:59,686
It is a license to lie!

565
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:02,231
- You don't understand.
- Yes, I understand.

566
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,233
I understand that never does
Pancho Villa...

567
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:08,567
want the world to see his sister Mariana
raped by <i>Federales.</i>

568
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,038
But that's what turned you into a rebel.

569
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,871
I know why I became what I became.

570
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:18,307
Pancho Villa does not have to see a movie
to find out who is Pancho Villa.

571
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:22,983
<i>Presidente</i> Villa.

572
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:25,487
From where does this <i>fantasía</i> come?

573
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:28,314
You have learned nothing from Juan Reed.

574
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:31,827
- There will never be a <i>Presidente</i> Villa.
- But there could be.

575
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:34,420
The <i>Revolución</i>
is to feed the people's hungry bellies...

576
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:38,490
- not the ambition of Pancho Villa.
- All right, but it's a wonderful scene.

577
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:49,568
Okay, we can make it a dream sequence.

578
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:51,005
Pancho Villa's dream...

579
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:54,050
is for a man of education
to be <i>presidente</i> of Mexico.

580
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:57,518
Your <i>Presidente</i> Wilson,
he was a professor, <i>sí?</i>

581
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:01,080
Pancho Villa is a professor
of horses and soldiers.

582
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:05,522
See, that's exactly what General Grant
was, and he became president.

583
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:08,321
That drunk dogface.

584
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:11,725
He killed <i>Mexicanos</i>
like he killed his whiskey bottles.

585
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:13,261
I had no idea.

586
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:16,897
No, in your history books
there are no bad <i>Americanos.</i>

587
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:19,969
He came before there was oil to steal.

588
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:24,241
He came for the gold and for the silver.
He came for the <i>azúcar. Es un insulto.</i>

589
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:27,613
You want to shoot the battle of Torreón,
you bring your cameras there.

590
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:31,085
You don't shoot the life of Pancho Villa
that he has never lived.

591
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,714
Mutual has a fortune sunk into this.

592
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:36,054
Lies are expensive, Francisco.

593
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:41,620
<i>Señor</i> Aitken, he tells to the world
he will tell the truth about Pancho Villa.

594
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,030
<i>Esta basura!</i> This is fake garbage!
