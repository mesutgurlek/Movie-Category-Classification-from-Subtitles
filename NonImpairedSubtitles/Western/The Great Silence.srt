1
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,615
I surrender!

2
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,253
Don't kill me, Silence!

3
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,011
I'm not going to hunt a bandit down
again, even if bounty is high.

4
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,539
I swear it.

5
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,818
Goddammit! My hands!
You've ruined my hands!

6
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,692
Let's move!

7
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,249
Even dead those damn bounty 
hunters do scare me.

8
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,615
You came right on time.
Take this, you deserve it.

9
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,819
Those sons of bitches ambush us everytime, when
we're going down to the valley to get some food.

10
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,254
They know, that we can't stay 
long here without food.

11
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,850
If we defend ourselves, the bounty get 
raised and we would have a massacre.

12
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,689
You could thank me at least.
The guy has almost shot.

13
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,413
Your bullet was useless, believe me.

14
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:27,378
Without his thumb this bastard couldn't touch 
a gun anymore, not to mention to shoot with it.

15
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,538
That's why Silence didn't kill him.
And it was self-defense against the others.

16
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,769
He knew, they waited for him,
but he was quicker, as usual.

17
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,292
Why somebody else has got to 
defend us? We've got weapons.

18
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,493
Let's go to the city and show it
to those damn bounty hunters.

19
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,692
We or them... This way things 
will come to an end.

20
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,892
Listen to me, friends: a lot of 
us aren't guilty of anything.

21
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,896
It's just unfair, to put 
a prize on our heads.

22
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,736
The new governor promised an amnesty.

23
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,215
- You have to resist that long.
- I give up.

24
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,009
I go to the city. I'll better be caught.

25
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,252
I will surrender.

26
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,011
In jail it's warm...

27
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,897
Wait, I'll go with you.

28
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,252
I go too.

29
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,771
- They'll wait for their amnesty in jail!
- If they'll come so far.

30
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,095
Miguel!

31
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,135
- Where's the lawyer, Mama?
- There.

32
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,494
I couldn't stand anymore. But I 
haven't told anything to the others.

33
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,531
I followed your advice.

34
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,573
How wise of you to trust into laws.

35
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,331
I'm glad, that you help me.

36
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,210
No... what are you doing?

37
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,414
Mama!

38
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,499
Miguel!

39
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,295
Miguel... my son!

40
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,136
You have to understand, that's 
how we earn our money.

41
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,411
I'll bring him directly to the sheriff.

42
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,649
What a luck, that his face isn't 
damaged. So he's still recognizable.

43
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,493
Come, let's go and collect 
the payments, Tigrero.

44
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,488
The reward is all yours, colleague, 
I was just nearby.

45
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,290
I'll catch the other two,
no one wil be disappointed.

46
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,298
But be careful, they killed five of us.

47
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,495
The amnesty was the start 
for a massive manhunt.

48
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,170
The bountyhunting has to be 
put to an end immediately.

49
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,975
- Certainly, governor, but...
- But?

50
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,810
Bounty hunters are people...
who're acting following the law.

51
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,491
Besides it's not that easy, to stay 
in control of such a big area alone.

52
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,260
But for you it is, sheriff.

53
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,177
Are you the second best gunslinger
in the state or not?

54
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,532
Certainly. But only, because I 
succesfully avoided the best one.

55
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,254
Keep on going. The electors have to 
believe into law and order again.

56
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,219
We have to put an end to "Wild West".

57
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,777
Bounty hunters, bandits and sheriffs
will be united in a better world.

58
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:24,851
In a world, where...

59
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,770
The governor would even free the murder 
of his president before the elections.

60
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,576
What are you saying, sheriff?
I don't understand you.

61
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,409
Nothing. I just think loud sometimes.

62
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,739
- A good soldier doesn't think.
- Certainly. No thoughts, just orders.

63
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,849
Forwards to Snow Hill...

64
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,608
Utah.

65
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,454
Enough! Stop!

66
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,898
Believe me, Tigrero, I don't know anything.

67
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,333
- Tell me first, where I can find him.
- I don't know him.

68
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,691
You know him well, he was 
with you in the mountains.

69
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,609
I don't know, where he went.
I beg you, let me go!

70
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,412
I don't know him.

71
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,459
Stop it!

72
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,732
Believe me, Tigrero!

73
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,251
I don't know anything! 
I don't know anything!

74
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,732
Don't lie to me. I'll find out, 
whatever you say.

75
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,453
In the mill,

76
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,016
outside the city,

77
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,652
where his wife is living. 
He's armed.

78
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,579
Thank you very much.

79
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,089
I'm ressurrection and I'm life.

80
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,418
Those, who believe in me, 
will never die. Amen.

81
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,299
If you're waiting for the stagecoach, 
you'll need patience.

82
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,857
Snow fell down in the mountains.
It will delay.

83
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,613
You want some warm meal,
while you're waiting?

84
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,248
Thank you, I'll serve it right away.

85
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,730
I know you, stranger.

86
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,093
You help the weak to their rights.

87
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,337
Your gun avenges the innocent.

88
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,131
My son was innocent too.

89
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,491
They killed him like many others.

90
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,658
I beg you to avenge him!

91
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,579
One of his murders has left, but 
the other one is still in the city.

92
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,136
I can only offer you Miguel's horse 
for the life of his murderer.

93
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,339
Kill him, avenge my son's death!

94
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,010
So you will save some another 
unfortunates from death.

95
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,934
Yes, I know.

96
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,412
Some of them collect bounties 
up to 5000 Dollar.

97
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,419
My friend Tigrero, for example,
puts always...

98
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,695
some money away. But 
with all that snow...

99
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,575
you can easily freeze your ass off.

100
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,649
I eat the whole time and it's still cold.

101
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,939
The doctor...

102
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,614
told me, it could be the blood.

103
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,930
He wanted to analyze it,

104
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,809
but I don't let anybody on my blood.

105
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,538
You're right, Charly.
That brings bad luck.

106
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,973
Certainly.

107
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,016
Shut the door, it's cold!

108
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,890
Shut it, I said!
Or you'll getting cold too...

109
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,091
but forever. You heard me?

110
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,614
Shut the door or I'll kill you.

111
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,216
Calm down, Charly.
To threat this one is dangerous.

112
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:22,296
I don't threat, sheriff, I shoot.
Close the fucking door!

113
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,254
Close the...

114
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:03,372
- What now, are we going to arrest him?
- No, Charly has drawn first.

115
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,814
The stranger shot as an act of self-defense.

116
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,814
This way the law can't convict him.

117
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,535
Maybe. But you have to draw
quicker then the devil.

118
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,209
Maybe it was the devil himself.

119
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,176
You waste your time.
My husband isn't here.

120
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,738
I know, but I don't risk my
skin for 1000 Dollar.

121
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,489
When he'll see you, he'll 
stay calm. Bring me to him.

122
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,090
I won't do that, leave!

123
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,576
Come on, move it!

124
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,980
If you love your wife, then come out!

125
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,939
Move!

126
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,733
I want you alive.

127
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,376
I'll collect the bounty anyway.

128
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,851
So why are you afraid?

129
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,332
Come out and surrender!

130
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,499
You rotten piece of meat.

131
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,254
Throw away your gun and 
put the hands up!

132
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,050
Now go and cover your
ex-husband with snow.

133
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,451
So he'll stay fresh on this cold.

134
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,329
He can't be buried, 'till I got my money.

135
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,258
Don't forget it, ok?

136
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,731
He was worth a lot.

137
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,739
What times are these!

138
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,330
A colored is worth more then a white. 

139
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,019
Help!

140
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,054
My husband was murdered, help me!

141
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,778
Boss, hes's brought here.

142
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,657
Pauline... oh my God, poor thing!

143
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,579
- You have to be strong.
- Don't cry!

144
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,053
Pollicut!

145
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:21,172
You dirty racketeer! You keep 
yourself in warmth, eh?

146
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,373
While this hapless perished because of you!

147
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,412
That's you, damn rascal...

148
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,010
who makes benefits off bounties,
set for people's heads.

149
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,371
This man was a criminal. He's 
got nothing, he didn't deserve.

150
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,971
It hasn't to take effects on Pauline.
She can have anything from me.

151
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,210
You pig!

152
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:44,299
She'd rather have to do with 
a rabid dog then with you!

153
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,579
Move!

154
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,732
Move on!

155
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,618
Forwards, come on.

156
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,368
Goddammit.

157
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,972
Move on!

158
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,933
Stupid brute!

159
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,089
Go!

160
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,290
I am the new sheriff.

161
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,054
I don't have any money.

162
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,418
Nada dinero!

163
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,491
If you're going to kill me, you all be hung.

164
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,009
If somebody moves, I'll shoot him.

165
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,494
You won't get me that easy.

166
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,369
Your rifle is frozen, sheriff.

167
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:35,378
We are experienced enough,
to hold our weapons warm...

168
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,936
and know how to use them right.

169
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,450
One false move and I'll crush your head!

170
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,617
Have no fear, we don't want to kill you.

171
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,457
- What do you want then?
- Your horse, sheriff.

172
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:57,613
What? You are so many, of what 
use one horse will be for you?

173
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,815
Beefsteak.

174
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,574
It'll fill our stomachs for one week.

175
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,416
- Move to my place, if you want to.
- That won't help.

176
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,129
I just want one thing:

177
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,375
to take revenge, even 
if it'll cost my life.

178
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,335
There was a reward set for your husband
and it's because of Pollicut.

179
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:52,011
When he didn't give him any work,
he practically forced him to steal.

180
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,136
You might be right, but the 
real murder is Tigrero.

181
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:06,856
I want his life for my husband's.

182
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,810
There is a man, before whom 
even the bounty hunters shudder.

183
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,056
They call him Silence...

184
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:20,899
because Silence and 
Death accompany him.

185
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,211
We're late.

186
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,936
Hey! Stop!

187
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,219
There's somebody.

188
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,774
I'm a sheriff.

189
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,130
I have to leave here.

190
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:43,451
Doesn't matter where you're heading to, 
first you bring me to Snow Hill.

191
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,897
- We don't go there.
- I don't care!

192
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,093
Bring me to Snow Hill! Immediately!

193
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,652
Excuse the detour, but I 
have to go to Snow Hill.

194
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,778
It's urgent.

195
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,456
I am the new sheriff.

196
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,694
As if it wouldn't be enough,

197
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,778
there's now this damn cold!

198
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,137
I know, what you think.

199
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:32,814
You think the administration is now 
sending out their people on own feet.

200
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,139
But... I didn't have to walk before.

201
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,533
The bandits took away 
my horse to eat it.

202
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,573
Unhitch the horses and replace them.

203
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,890
When the snowstorm starts, we'll be stuck.

204
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,809
Please, help me carrying.
I'll buy a you a drink later.

205
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,968
I gonna take the bigger one.

206
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,970
How heavy he is!

207
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,739
Come, pull it!

208
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,819
Here it goes!

209
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,129
Hey, you!

210
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:36,777
You can't transport the dead like that.
There are exact prescriptions for it.

211
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,974
I am the new sheriff of Snow Hill.

212
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,289
I noticed from your star. In 
fact you look like a rancher.

213
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:49,530
But with the star you look like 
a rancher, who plays sheriff.

214
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,131
Go on!

215
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:57,935
Who's the clown with a priest's 
hat and women's furcoat?

216
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,893
That's Tigrero. You better 
dispose of him quickly.

217
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,579
- Thanks.
- No big deal.

218
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,213
Wait!

219
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,298
I have to freshen up your memory a bit.

220
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,936
The dead are only allowed to be 
transported in wood- or metalcoffins.

221
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,495
Regulation's Article 15...

222
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,169
- These are no ordinary corpses.
- They aren't?

223
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,372
What corpses are they then?

224
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,732
Two bandits, which I eliminated
and bringing to Snow Hill.

225
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:27,769
I want to obtain the bounty finally, 
before they have rotten.

226
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,573
If you excuse me...

227
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:58,294
There are four on the posters.
Which ones are the two on the roof?

228
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,531
The second and the third.

229
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,015
One is already in the city. He'll be 
buried, as soon as he'll be paid for.

230
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:11,136
The law wants them dead or alive.
You prefer dead, it seems.

231
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:16,690
Alive they come expensive. That's why
the law accepts alternative states.

232
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:23,377
Besides it'd be far too dangerous. These
people act against God and the whole world,

233
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:28,700
against morale, law and order. They 
really belong to the graveyard.

234
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,053
Hold it, please!

235
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,139
What happened?

236
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,171
I have to load up another one.

237
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:43,253
- Help me, I wouldn't accomplish it alone.
- What is he doing now?

238
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,573
Come here!

239
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,259
Lift him up, come on!

240
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,928
I took care of this one two days ago.
The cold have got him conserved.

241
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,969
He's only worth 500 Dollar,
but every little helps.

242
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,290
What do you want, money is money. You 
have to take precautions for the old age.

243
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,890
Who knows, if you'll live 
long enough to see it.

244
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:33,451
One day you're going to meet somebody, 
who draws faster then you.

245
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,290
That'll be a pleasureable day. 
Very pleasureable.

246
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,369
Come, the coach has arrived!

247
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:19,490
See you next time, my friend.
I hope you'll be more talkative then.

248
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,893
Here is your saddle.

249
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,137
I pictured Snow Hill a bit bigger.

250
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,173
If it's going to continue snowing like it 
does, it'll be even smaller by tomorrow.

251
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,858
The man over there, with the horse...

252
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,088
- I want to know where he's heading.
- Alright.

253
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,860
Don't let your capital lying on the street.

254
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,211
Bury it or take it home, got it?

255
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,611
If you pay me right now, they're yours.

256
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,890
Me? That's the last thing I needed.

257
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,619
You think, I'm the undertaker here?

258
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,819
I don't like neither your 
face or your manners.

259
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,898
So prepare, or you might 
end also like them.

260
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,452
Good evening, sheriff.
Welcome to Snow Hill.

261
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,458
I'm delighted to see, that 
you can enforce respect.

262
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,969
And who the hell are you?

263
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:24,377
You couldn't guess?
I'm Edwin Pollicut.

264
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,696
That's my store.

265
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,611
My name was surely mentioned, 
when you were sent here.

266
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,458
I'm sorry. Are you that important? What do 
you do apart from commercial business?

267
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:40,131
I'm the magistrate here.
We will work together.

268
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:45,211
So let's finish the business?
You pay me the bounty and it's done.

269
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,493
It's finished for me already.

270
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,090
Come tomorrow to my office
and receive your payment.

271
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,656
Yes, that's mine. Come inside.

272
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,936
I pictured you different 
from what you look like.

273
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,015
It's not, like that's important...

274
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,249
Please, take a seat.

275
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,050
I asked you here, to kill a man.

276
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,933
How much do you want for it?

277
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,219
Answer me at least.

278
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,458
Can't you talk?

279
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,254
Forgive me.

280
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,058
I couldn't imagine...

281
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,570
"1000 Dollar. Who is it?"

282
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:26,729
Tomorrow or in two days at the 
latest I'll have the money.

283
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,851
I just need some time.

284
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:39,693
It's Tigrero, the bounty hunter.
He was with you in the coach.

285
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,817
He killed my husband.

286
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,330
Also for 1000 Dollar.

287
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,013
No. If I have to kill him, you 
should put a reward on his head.

288
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,336
You should do it for free.

289
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:02,059
It's of your interest. He's 
an enemy of the bounty hunters.

290
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:09,496
I know him. A dreamer, who wanna 
change the world through a gun.

291
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,650
His methods are marvelous.
He draws second...

292
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,658
but shoots first. But one 
day he'll bite the dust.

293
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,691
He wants to kill you.

294
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,929
Pauline ordered him here.
He'll challenge you.

295
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:30,014
He won't do me any harm.
Your thumbhunter...

296
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,414
won't kill me in self defense.

297
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,455
Maybe he's looking for you.

298
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,775
Get the negress to your 
bed quickly, you fool.

299
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,537
I got her husband out of your 
way, what do you want more?

300
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,051
If you're looking for a killer,
why not to ask your footman.

301
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,772
Tomorrow some colleagues 
of mine will arrive.

302
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,657
You're going to stay here tonight.

303
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,776
So nobody will see you in here.

304
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,732
There is a bed by the staircase.
Good night.

305
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:22,815
Proof your innocence.
You can't kill them.

306
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,817
Do it for your son!

307
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:37,338
Gordon, come out. Sheriff speaks 
here. Resistance is futile.

308
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,969
You better go to jail

309
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,739
or we'll pump you up with lead.

310
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:48,096
There is a reward set on you.
Surrender to the law.

311
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,575
Throw your gun away!

312
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,336
A good attorney might proof your innocence.

313
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,849
All right, sheriff, I surrender.

314
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,419
Mama! Mama!

315
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,495
The boy will betray us.

316
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,255
No.

317
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,058
He'll never speak again.

318
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,812
First corpses, then money,
that's the rule.

319
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:36,568
The law asks for irrefutable proof,

320
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:41,808
that's why Tigrero always present the 
corpses with the particular warrant.

321
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,533
Absolutely like the rules require.

322
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:48,416
That might be true, but why you interfere?

323
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:53,018
As a financier you only have to 
advance me the money, to pay him.

324
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:58,933
Certainly, but I claim commission of
25% interest from this money.

325
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,815
A little income, granted by the state.

326
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,090
Everything, like the law says.

327
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:09,010
As well as an immediate cash payment
without formalities, or am I wrong?

328
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,019
For my part, pay him off
and remove the corpses!

329
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,051
They stink.

330
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,859
That'd be...

331
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,292
500 two times...

332
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,532
and two for each 1000.

333
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:32,775
Altogether 3000.

334
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:36,532
Outside there are only three,
why do you pay him for four?

335
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:42,137
- Why four rewards?
- Because... there are four.

336
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,252
But here are just three.

337
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:49,052
I left the negro here, but 
his wife buried him already.

338
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,694
- Everybody here knows that.
- Yes, that's true.

339
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:56,132
That's not right according to the 
regulations. Like you said before:

340
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:01,219
first corpses, then money,
but it's not like that.

341
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,380
I'll take a closer look at this,
so the money is confiscated for now.

342
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:07,333
I'll interrogate the widow
and initiate an investigation.

343
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:10,532
Then I'm going to write a 
report to the governor.

344
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,493
He'll forward it to a competent 
position to be taken care of.

345
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,329
Isn't it what you had in mind?

346
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,330
"Everything, like the law says."

347
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,292
Pretty cold, isn't it?

348
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:31,011
If it'll continue the way it goes, 
you'll certainly return back to Africa.

349
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,095
I'm sorry, didn't mean it.

350
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,608
Ehmm... Pauline.

351
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,612
What can I do for you?

352
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,537
Do you want to buy anything?

353
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,973
I don't really want to 
buy, more like to sell.

354
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:53,058
- And what?
- My house.

355
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,335
It's worth minimum 5000 dollars.

356
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:00,453
I give it away for 1000.
I know, you like good deals.

357
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,493
Let's go over there.

358
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,576
- Take care of the store.
- Alright, Chef.

359
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:33,973
- May I ask you, what the money is for?
- No.

360
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,139
Well...

361
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,612
I can guess already, what the purpose is.

362
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:45,491
- Qualified killer are expensive.
- That's my business.

363
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,056
Are you interested in my offer?

364
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,772
No, Pauline.

365
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:01,453
I am not like you think. I won't 
take advantage of your distress.

366
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:05,055
No... I want to help you.

367
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,656
Go to hell.

368
00:48:54,154 --> 00:48:57,863
Not bad, my friend, but 
it could be better.

369
00:49:15,434 --> 00:49:17,231
What do you say now?

370
00:49:23,714 --> 00:49:27,502
Oh yes, I heard about it already.

371
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:31,946
Some kinda improved gun, but 
not a quite accurate tool.

372
00:50:15,354 --> 00:50:17,549
Good power. Damn good.

373
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:22,592
I'm wondering, what a shooter 
like you, is looking here for.

374
00:50:25,514 --> 00:50:28,824
Are you one of those dirty 
scumbags of bounty hunters?

375
00:50:33,834 --> 00:50:37,224
Answer, when I ask you something. 
I'm the sheriff here.

376
00:50:38,874 --> 00:50:41,707
Who are you? Where are you from?

377
00:50:43,594 --> 00:50:45,152
How long you gonna stay?

378
00:50:47,434 --> 00:50:50,346
If you think you can play the 
wiseguy, you're wrong.

379
00:50:51,754 --> 00:50:53,506
Are you going to answer or not?

380
00:50:53,714 --> 00:50:56,547
He can't answer, he's mute

381
00:51:01,314 --> 00:51:03,748
Ehhh, you could have said something.
I mean...

382
00:51:04,274 --> 00:51:05,787
could have explained...

383
00:51:08,994 --> 00:51:10,222
Listen...

384
00:51:11,154 --> 00:51:13,543
Tell me something.

385
00:51:16,434 --> 00:51:20,109
I heard, that you buried your husband,

386
00:51:21,834 --> 00:51:25,190
after a bounty hunter killed him.

387
00:51:25,714 --> 00:51:26,464
So...

388
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,750
- Is it true?
- Yes.

389
00:51:32,954 --> 00:51:35,627
- What was his name?
- James Middleton.

390
00:51:35,834 --> 00:51:39,144
- No, the bounty hunter's name.
- Tigrero.

391
00:51:42,354 --> 00:51:44,993
- I raise.
- Pass.

392
00:51:46,234 --> 00:51:49,067
- Cornerstraight.
- Nice play.

393
00:51:54,354 --> 00:51:57,426
Come, I want another chance!
Let's double the bets.

394
00:51:57,754 --> 00:51:59,426
Of course it's cold, the fire is off.

395
00:51:59,634 --> 00:52:02,706
No false hopes, you won't make 
money out of me today.

396
00:52:03,434 --> 00:52:07,222
Actually you've promised us 
"the big money" in Snow Hill.

397
00:52:09,394 --> 00:52:11,828
In real here's not a shadow of a bandit.

398
00:52:12,034 --> 00:52:13,513
Come on, Schulz.

399
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:16,387
Those thugs are cornered, soon hunger 
will drive them into the city.

400
00:52:16,594 --> 00:52:20,109
There will be so many, that 
you'll get out of ammo.

401
00:52:20,314 --> 00:52:21,508
Such a cold!

402
00:52:22,394 --> 00:52:24,430
- You need a match?
- Thank you.

403
00:52:25,674 --> 00:52:27,232
Salute!

404
00:52:28,514 --> 00:52:30,505
May I introduce my friends?

405
00:52:33,274 --> 00:52:35,310
It's not really of a big value to me...

406
00:52:36,594 --> 00:52:38,471
to know your friends.

407
00:52:40,634 --> 00:52:42,352
Here is the money.

408
00:52:43,234 --> 00:52:47,273
Really nice, that you came 
all the way here to pay me.

409
00:52:48,074 --> 00:52:51,783
I'm not nice, I want you to 
vanish as soon as possible.

410
00:52:52,074 --> 00:52:54,588
But that's against my plans.

411
00:52:55,074 --> 00:53:00,467
The air is very healthy, I like the 
perspective... and even the sheriff.

412
00:53:01,474 --> 00:53:04,307
The perspective will change quickly.

413
00:53:04,554 --> 00:53:07,864
And the air might become 
unbreathable for all of you.

414
00:53:10,594 --> 00:53:11,470
Whiskey.

415
00:53:20,674 --> 00:53:24,952
I couldn't find the money.
Anyhow I want my revenge.

416
00:53:26,154 --> 00:53:27,507
That doesn't mean...

417
00:53:29,154 --> 00:53:31,509
that you should do it for free.

418
00:53:35,234 --> 00:53:38,590
There is somebody, who would
pay me money immediately.

419
00:53:40,674 --> 00:53:44,906
More then necessary.
However he demands...

420
00:53:46,474 --> 00:53:47,509
well...

421
00:53:49,114 --> 00:53:53,744
You can already imagine - this 
price would be too high.

422
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:57,663
But I'm ready to pay it to you.

423
00:53:58,874 --> 00:54:03,390
Now, before, afterwards... 
Whenever.

424
00:54:06,834 --> 00:54:07,584
I pass.

425
00:54:09,714 --> 00:54:11,750
Always winning, Tigrero?

426
00:54:12,194 --> 00:54:15,709
At the end your friends will sit 
around only in their pyjamas.

427
00:54:16,514 --> 00:54:20,951
But be careful - you could get a 
pyjama yourself, but a wooden one.

428
00:54:22,074 --> 00:54:27,432
In your dirty sector of business you 
should be prepared for everything.

429
00:54:27,834 --> 00:54:31,144
Every profession has its own 
rules and its own risk.

430
00:54:31,794 --> 00:54:34,991
And these rules will be 
followed, understood?

431
00:54:37,554 --> 00:54:41,832
Otherwise I'll stitch you 
this wooden pyjamas.

432
00:54:44,354 --> 00:54:45,833
You buy me a beer?

433
00:54:47,194 --> 00:54:49,503
No, if I'm going to stay longer, 
I'll have to puke.

434
00:54:49,714 --> 00:54:52,103
- Let's go out then.
- OK.

435
00:54:57,234 --> 00:54:59,623
- I start.
- I go with.

436
00:55:01,474 --> 00:55:02,748
200.

437
00:55:05,474 --> 00:55:08,944
- I raise to 300.
- I stay.

438
00:55:12,034 --> 00:55:12,944
Good.

439
00:55:13,834 --> 00:55:14,983
Me too.

440
00:55:15,874 --> 00:55:17,273
I hold.

441
00:55:20,314 --> 00:55:21,588
Once again.

442
00:55:22,594 --> 00:55:24,266
How many cards?

443
00:55:24,474 --> 00:55:25,987
Two, please.

444
00:55:27,434 --> 00:55:28,708
Give me three.

445
00:55:32,834 --> 00:55:34,062
Two for me.

446
00:55:37,194 --> 00:55:38,627
Two cards.

447
00:55:43,154 --> 00:55:44,473
One here.

448
00:55:45,754 --> 00:55:47,187
200 dollars.

449
00:55:47,754 --> 00:55:49,870
- I quit.
- Ditto.

450
00:55:50,074 --> 00:55:51,666
300 and we'll play.

451
00:55:54,954 --> 00:55:56,069
I pass.

452
00:55:59,194 --> 00:56:00,468
Me too.

453
00:56:02,354 --> 00:56:03,946
500 dollars.

454
00:56:43,154 --> 00:56:47,147
Listen, mute, you hope, that 
I draw first, am I right?

455
00:56:48,114 --> 00:56:50,582
That's your method, I know that.

456
00:56:51,234 --> 00:56:56,354
But not with me. You won't trick me.

457
00:56:59,354 --> 00:57:02,551
If somebody is going to 
draw first, it'll be you.

458
00:57:03,234 --> 00:57:05,589
You can't count on me.

459
00:57:05,794 --> 00:57:07,466
Far from it.

460
00:57:08,754 --> 00:57:11,143
Because I don't want to take a risk...

461
00:57:13,434 --> 00:57:16,267
Jack, take my belt off.

462
00:57:37,634 --> 00:57:39,272
Actually I really think...

463
00:57:40,674 --> 00:57:43,632
that today is a pleasure day for me.

464
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:18,104
Did I hurt you?

465
00:59:03,154 --> 00:59:07,147
You're busted, Tigrero. Without 
me you would have fired.

466
00:59:16,874 --> 00:59:19,024
- You can't imprison me.
- Of course I can.

467
00:59:19,234 --> 00:59:22,670
- And what if I pay the bailment?
- It's 100 dollars.

468
00:59:22,874 --> 00:59:27,789
My money is on the poker table.
There are the 3000 Dollar from you.

469
00:59:27,994 --> 00:59:30,462
It's not in your possession 
anymore. It's confiscated.

470
00:59:30,674 --> 00:59:33,711
Give me the money. 2000 are in for you.

471
00:59:34,194 --> 00:59:39,791
Very good, an attempted bribe. That 
rises the bailment to 5000 Dollar.

472
00:59:40,154 --> 00:59:44,306
It bugs you, that I kill bandits.
You are doing exactly the same.

473
00:59:44,554 --> 00:59:47,466
That's something different.
I do, what the law wants.

474
00:59:47,674 --> 00:59:50,950
- And that means?
- That's no murder, but punishment.

475
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:54,271
The death of a bandit shouldn't be 
a business, it should be a warning.

476
00:59:54,474 --> 00:59:55,873
- Amen.
- Shut up!

477
00:59:56,634 --> 01:00:03,187
Sheriff, here are Tigrero's things. And 
this is the money, which was on the table.

478
01:00:03,394 --> 01:00:06,704
Thank you. You are very mindful, Regine.

479
01:00:08,874 --> 01:00:12,867
- You might... have a coffee with me?
- I'd be glad, let me pour some for you.

480
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:20,750
A man like you should always be 
served by a woman like me.

481
01:00:25,114 --> 01:00:27,548
You're really very kind.

482
01:00:29,154 --> 01:00:34,626
It would be nice, if you could 
serve me coffee sometimes.

483
01:00:35,074 --> 01:00:37,030
Regine serves usually another customers.

484
01:00:37,234 --> 01:00:40,704
With her curves she could please 
a whole regiment of sheriffs.

485
01:00:54,634 --> 01:00:56,829
Don't talk like that to a lady.

486
01:00:58,834 --> 01:01:00,711
I'm so sorry!

487
01:01:02,754 --> 01:01:07,032
I ask for an immediate 
discharge of this man.

488
01:01:07,234 --> 01:01:08,747
And why?

489
01:01:08,954 --> 01:01:14,347
It's a wish from the citizens of Snow Hill. 
These gentlemen are their representatives.

490
01:01:14,834 --> 01:01:18,110
- And the bail money?
- I advance it.

491
01:01:19,034 --> 01:01:22,470
The freedom of this man 
means to you that much?

492
01:01:23,314 --> 01:01:29,662
There are a lot of bandits in the mountains
waiting for a unconstitutional amnesty.

493
01:01:30,434 --> 01:01:36,191
The bounty hunters defend us from them.

494
01:01:37,474 --> 01:01:43,185
- That's my responsibility.
- But there's much more trouble.

495
01:01:43,394 --> 01:01:45,908
Among the killed was Klaus Schulz.

496
01:01:46,434 --> 01:01:49,392
His brother Bodo is the best 
gunshooter in whole Nevada.

497
01:01:49,594 --> 01:01:52,552
He won't find peace, until he took revenge.

498
01:01:52,754 --> 01:01:54,346
In short, sheriff:

499
01:01:55,554 --> 01:01:58,546
If you're not going to release 
Tigrero, his friends will do,

500
01:01:58,754 --> 01:02:02,030
and this all leads to...
a serious trouble.

501
01:02:03,314 --> 01:02:06,590
That's what you're saying...
Listen to me everybody:

502
01:02:07,874 --> 01:02:09,307
Nothing will happen.

503
01:02:09,514 --> 01:02:13,553
These bandits, who you're so afraid of, 
are just some hungry beggars.

504
01:02:13,754 --> 01:02:18,987
Put a wagon with food outside 
and they'll leave you alone.

505
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:21,185
And concerning Bodo Schulz...

506
01:02:21,434 --> 01:02:24,631
If he wants to free Tigrero,
then from the jail in Tonota.

507
01:02:24,834 --> 01:02:26,950
That's where I'll bring him.

508
01:06:15,434 --> 01:06:21,111
Boss! The bandits are coming and
sheriff brings Tigrero away.

509
01:06:32,514 --> 01:06:38,430
Our hero threatens us with the name 
of Bodo Schulz. This is all idle talk.

510
01:06:38,634 --> 01:06:42,593
Bodo can't even know, that 
his brother was killed.

511
01:06:42,994 --> 01:06:48,273
And the bandits?
They're on the way here.

512
01:06:48,474 --> 01:06:53,423
That's useless tattle. Do what I tell 
you and nothing bad will happen.

513
01:06:53,954 --> 01:06:57,264
Put food on a wagon outside 
on the city entrance.

514
01:06:57,514 --> 01:06:59,789
Thus, whose stomachs are full 
don't need to steal.

515
01:07:00,114 --> 01:07:02,105
And you all stay in your homes, understood?

516
01:07:03,194 --> 01:07:04,547
Let's go, forwards!

517
01:07:05,114 --> 01:07:09,392
Unbelievable. Now we have to 
appease criminals with bread.

518
01:07:10,074 --> 01:07:13,350
When wuill justice and reason 
return here again...

519
01:07:13,754 --> 01:07:15,267
After you'll be hung.

520
01:07:27,234 --> 01:07:30,306
Is this son of a bitch heavily wounded?

521
01:07:30,554 --> 01:07:34,263
I think so. He must have 
lost a lot of blood.

522
01:07:34,914 --> 01:07:36,666
I hope he'll perish soon.

523
01:07:37,594 --> 01:07:39,710
- Where is he now?
- In the negress's house.

524
01:08:16,114 --> 01:08:18,230
We're coming forwards too slow.

525
01:08:19,514 --> 01:08:22,824
Your silent friend can follow 
us and kill me from behind.

526
01:08:23,034 --> 01:08:25,389
The mute is wounded and he 
wouldn't shoot in an ambush.

527
01:08:25,594 --> 01:08:29,473
But I'm still worried. Let's 
ride on the other bank.

528
01:08:30,274 --> 01:08:34,665
Whatever. The main thing is,
that I'll deliver you in jail.

529
01:08:40,234 --> 01:08:41,428
Look, sheriff.

530
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:50,463
The bandits! Take off 
my handcuffs, quickly!

531
01:08:50,674 --> 01:08:52,710
The cuffs stay.

532
01:08:53,274 --> 01:08:57,347
These people are just hungry.
Smile, as if nothing has happened.

533
01:09:18,834 --> 01:09:20,153
Goddamn murder!

534
01:09:25,434 --> 01:09:28,870
Today my weapon is warm and as 
much as you can see, it works well.

535
01:09:31,354 --> 01:09:32,867
Listen to me, friends.

536
01:09:33,234 --> 01:09:37,466
Soon the amnesty will come.
You all can go home then.

537
01:09:39,194 --> 01:09:41,662
So don't make any trouble.

538
01:09:42,314 --> 01:09:45,351
There is food waiting for you in the city.

539
01:09:45,554 --> 01:09:48,307
Go to Snow Hill and fill your stomachs.

540
01:09:48,514 --> 01:09:52,985
But spare our horses this time. They 
might be very indigestible for you.

541
01:09:55,514 --> 01:09:58,426
- Is the food really there?
- I give you my word.

542
01:10:29,554 --> 01:10:30,748
Let's return, sheriff.

543
01:10:31,034 --> 01:10:35,027
We'll wait and finish them 
at the food wagon.

544
01:10:35,234 --> 01:10:39,022
Apart from each other they aren't very valuable, 
but taken altogether it's a good business.

545
01:10:39,234 --> 01:10:41,987
Usually I don't beat up captives,

546
01:10:42,194 --> 01:10:45,266
but if you keep going to talk like that,
you force me to change my mind.

547
01:10:46,034 --> 01:10:48,423
This proposal came from the heart.

548
01:10:48,634 --> 01:10:51,228
You saved my skin, so 
I wanted to pay back.

549
01:10:51,474 --> 01:10:52,429
Listen to me.

550
01:10:52,634 --> 01:10:56,024
One more word, and I'll make it short!

551
01:11:08,834 --> 01:11:10,870
My husband was a good man.

552
01:11:11,514 --> 01:11:15,189
He was accused of theft, because 
he tried to care for us.

553
01:11:17,674 --> 01:11:20,746
Pollicut put the reward on his head.

554
01:11:22,354 --> 01:11:25,073
He hoped, I'd become his lover.

555
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:29,911
But he was mistaken.

556
01:11:31,914 --> 01:11:32,744
Pauline!

557
01:11:48,714 --> 01:11:51,467
We collect food for the bandits

558
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:53,744
Everybody should contribute.
Can you spend something?

559
01:11:53,954 --> 01:11:55,228
Let me see.

560
01:11:55,434 --> 01:12:00,269
Good, but don't haste. And 
best greets to Silence...

561
01:12:03,394 --> 01:12:05,305
Just take everything...

562
01:12:42,474 --> 01:12:45,784
People like you aren't needed anymore.

563
01:12:45,994 --> 01:12:49,270
- Do you want to abolish bounty hunting?
- No, but the crimes.

564
01:12:49,834 --> 01:12:54,112
Amerika has to be ruled by 
justice, not by violence.

565
01:12:55,154 --> 01:12:56,303
You know, sheriff...

566
01:12:57,954 --> 01:12:58,750
What?

567
01:13:00,474 --> 01:13:03,432
Your prophetic skill is 
worth some applause.

568
01:13:03,634 --> 01:13:06,990
As soon as you dangle on the 
gallows, I am going to applaude.

569
01:13:14,274 --> 01:13:15,753
- I have to take a short break.
- Whatfor?

570
01:13:17,554 --> 01:13:21,308
I have to take a shit.
But the handcuffs...

571
01:13:26,994 --> 01:13:27,904
Alright.

572
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:53,313
Thank you, sheriff.

573
01:13:54,754 --> 01:13:56,949
Go... and hurry up.

574
01:13:57,394 --> 01:13:59,066
I couldn't really hold it back anymore.

575
01:13:59,274 --> 01:14:02,027
I don't want to wait long, got it?

576
01:14:07,714 --> 01:14:11,184
- So, Tigrero - are you done?
- Please, excuse me.

577
01:14:17,274 --> 01:14:19,390
We're very late.

578
01:14:20,394 --> 01:14:24,910
I want to cross the ice before the 
dark - don't like to travel at night.

579
01:14:25,114 --> 01:14:27,344
I'll regain some time.

580
01:14:33,554 --> 01:14:35,146
Hands up, sheriff!

581
01:14:37,594 --> 01:14:42,827
Tigrero, stop the bullshit! For murder of 
a sheriff you'll become a death sentence!

582
01:14:45,554 --> 01:14:49,467
Only an idiot would! That's why 
you'll end under this ice,

583
01:14:49,674 --> 01:14:53,269
and I'm going to continue to follow
the good, old rule of the strongest.

584
01:17:12,674 --> 01:17:16,383
Easy, friends. Since when 
wolfes eat each other?

585
01:17:16,874 --> 01:17:19,627
Hey, Tigrero! Who put you on a chain?

586
01:17:20,954 --> 01:17:24,264
The most likeable sheriff of this region.

587
01:17:24,754 --> 01:17:26,233
Come, release me.

588
01:17:27,154 --> 01:17:31,466
Ah yes... the sheriff of Snow Hill.
A dirty braggart.

589
01:17:31,754 --> 01:17:36,111
That's, what he was. Now 
he isn't dirty anymore.

590
01:17:36,554 --> 01:17:41,230
I made him a nice bath - he didn't 
came up to the surface anymore.

591
01:17:41,594 --> 01:17:44,870
He couldn't swim. May 
his soul rest in peace.

592
01:17:46,874 --> 01:17:49,672
Now we are the law in Snow Hill.

593
01:17:50,434 --> 01:17:52,504
We can work in peace again.

594
01:17:54,194 --> 01:17:56,754
I know of a roaring trade, 
which is completely legal.

595
01:18:01,914 --> 01:18:05,873
I encountered the bandites. 
They're on their way to the city.

596
01:18:07,234 --> 01:18:11,022
That'd be enough to surprise them,
and we'll become all at once.

597
01:18:11,434 --> 01:18:13,994
And somebody waits for us in Snow Hill...

598
01:18:14,834 --> 01:18:17,029
somebody you'd love to kill:

599
01:18:17,754 --> 01:18:18,630
the mute,

600
01:18:19,234 --> 01:18:20,906
who likes to shoot away thumbs.

601
01:18:21,474 --> 01:18:25,513
If there's a dead sheriff behind 
this game, I prefer to hold off.

602
01:18:35,514 --> 01:18:38,312
Dtd you already know, that 
the mute shot your brother?

603
01:18:41,434 --> 01:18:42,549
Klaus?

604
01:18:43,874 --> 01:18:47,105
He didn't even... had enough 
time to defend himself.

605
01:18:47,834 --> 01:18:49,108
Come with me.

606
01:20:45,074 --> 01:20:46,189
No!

607
01:21:00,834 --> 01:21:02,426
Leave me alone!

608
01:21:03,354 --> 01:21:04,582
Coward!

609
01:21:05,714 --> 01:21:06,590
No!

610
01:21:10,394 --> 01:21:11,509
Look at this hand!

611
01:21:12,074 --> 01:21:13,302
Do you remember?

612
01:22:09,794 --> 01:22:14,584
It used to be a normal hand. Now 
it can't use a gun anymore.

613
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:21,187
But for what I have planned, 
I won't need a gun.

614
01:22:21,394 --> 01:22:23,225
No! Help!

615
01:22:27,434 --> 01:22:28,389
Help!

616
01:23:06,754 --> 01:23:07,823
My darling!

617
01:24:01,114 --> 01:24:02,024
Pauline!

618
01:24:05,114 --> 01:24:07,150
Tigrero came to the city 
with five other men.

619
01:24:07,354 --> 01:24:08,867
They're looking for Silence.

620
01:24:09,234 --> 01:24:11,065
Have you herad? You must flee!

621
01:24:11,274 --> 01:24:14,710
Bring yourself to a safe place!
If they'll find you, they'll kill you.

622
01:24:15,274 --> 01:24:17,742
But he's wounded. He can't move well.

623
01:24:17,954 --> 01:24:20,946
- We've got to hide him.
- I beseech you, help me!

624
01:24:37,074 --> 01:24:38,029
Tigrero!

625
01:24:40,634 --> 01:24:45,469
The mute killed Pollicut.
He's in negress's house.

626
01:24:45,674 --> 01:24:47,824
Go there and kill him.

627
01:24:48,514 --> 01:24:49,993
Take revenge.

628
01:25:26,154 --> 01:25:29,590
Stand still, Tigrero!
One more step and I shoot!

629
01:25:31,754 --> 01:25:35,064
Throw away the gun, bitch, or I'll
send you after your sheriff.

630
01:25:36,474 --> 01:25:38,988
Sleazy coward, you killed him!

631
01:25:41,514 --> 01:25:43,550
Have you seen, she shot first.

632
01:25:48,834 --> 01:25:51,302
Search for the mute - he can't be far.

633
01:26:10,994 --> 01:26:14,145
Come on, do it! You have to find him.

634
01:26:16,154 --> 01:26:17,473
Not one soul is here.

635
01:26:19,514 --> 01:26:20,583
Here neither.

636
01:26:42,074 --> 01:26:44,588
We searched everything - the house is empty.

637
01:26:45,194 --> 01:26:46,422
We're gonna find him.

638
01:26:47,154 --> 01:26:50,749
The bandits are close!
Not far away from the city.

639
01:26:54,354 --> 01:26:57,551
Let's go then! We'll deal 
with the mute later!

640
01:27:03,874 --> 01:27:06,866
I'm going to try to warn those 
people, before they'll be trapped.

641
01:27:07,714 --> 01:27:09,432
You stay here hiding.

642
01:27:16,194 --> 01:27:19,550
Come on, friends! The food is 
there, sheriff told the truth.

643
01:27:39,474 --> 01:27:40,463
Don't shoot!

644
01:27:40,914 --> 01:27:44,190
If we want the mute, we'll need them alive.

645
01:27:48,154 --> 01:27:50,714
Give up! You're surrounded!

646
01:27:51,394 --> 01:27:54,784
Throw the weapons away,
or we'll kill you all!

647
01:28:13,954 --> 01:28:15,467
Come on, move ya!

648
01:28:25,034 --> 01:28:26,353
Quickly!

649
01:28:43,794 --> 01:28:46,672
All men down! Back to the counter!

650
01:29:00,914 --> 01:29:03,223
I want, that Silence comes...

651
01:29:04,714 --> 01:29:06,591
for a payoff.

652
01:29:11,514 --> 01:29:14,187
If he'll succeed to kill me...

653
01:29:18,354 --> 01:29:20,629
you're all free.

654
01:29:26,274 --> 01:29:28,549
My friends agreed.

655
01:29:28,994 --> 01:29:31,462
My life for lifes of all others.

656
01:29:31,794 --> 01:29:34,866
Tell him that! You know, where he is.

657
01:30:18,314 --> 01:30:19,429
I came too late.

658
01:30:20,194 --> 01:30:23,630
I tried, but... Tigrero has 
already overwhelmed them.

659
01:30:24,234 --> 01:30:26,748
They're still alive, but 
bound like animals.

660
01:30:27,634 --> 01:30:30,512
When I was returning, Tigrero caught up with me.

661
01:30:31,354 --> 01:30:36,109
He said, if you won't come for a 
pay off, he'll kill the hostages.

662
01:30:43,914 --> 01:30:44,903
But...

663
01:30:45,994 --> 01:30:49,464
you shouldn't go there.
It's surely a trap.

664
01:30:51,754 --> 01:30:55,224
You're wounded and they are six men.

665
01:30:55,634 --> 01:30:58,512
Alone you're powerless...

666
01:31:01,074 --> 01:31:02,302
against the violence.

667
01:31:03,194 --> 01:31:06,027
Let's flee, move away together.

668
01:31:07,714 --> 01:31:10,592
I don't want them to kill you, I love you.

669
01:32:30,794 --> 01:32:33,228
Come on, what are you waiting for?

670
01:32:35,074 --> 01:32:36,507
Let's finish the things up.

671
01:32:37,514 --> 01:32:41,905
Kill us all. Silence won't come anyway.

672
01:32:42,994 --> 01:32:44,791
Kill us, murderer!

673
01:34:23,514 --> 01:34:24,583
He is here.

674
01:36:51,874 --> 01:36:52,784
No!

675
01:36:57,314 --> 01:36:58,269
You coward!

676
01:37:27,154 --> 01:37:30,066
No, have mercy!
We don't want to die!

677
01:38:13,074 --> 01:38:15,144
We have to gain our bounty money.

678
01:38:16,554 --> 01:38:17,987
We'll collect it later.

679
01:38:19,034 --> 01:38:20,513
Everything like law says.
