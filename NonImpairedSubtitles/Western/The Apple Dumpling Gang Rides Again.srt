<i>And all those thefts</i>
<i>occurred in territory under</i>

I want you to mount

Take as many men as you need,

20

24
00:03:08,568 --> 00:03:12,060

my command here.

25

I'll leave immediately.

Wonder how fast they really are.
I don't want to be the one to find out.

748
01:00:11,488 --> 01:00:14,753
Everybody sure has been
nice to us, Theodore.

749
01:00:14,824 --> 01:00:18,624
The guy who gave us these
uniforms, wanted to make sure
they fit. Even called us "sir."

750
01:00:18,695 --> 01:00:21,357
That's because they think
we're the fastest guns in the West.

751
01:00:21,431 --> 01:00:24,366
- Well, we did get Woolly Bill.
- On the first bounce.

752
01:00:24,434 --> 01:00:27,995
If it ever gets out what
really happened in that bank,
we won't last a week in here.

753
01:00:28,071 --> 01:00:32,098
- What are you gonna do?
- First, we gotta find out who's
really running things here.

754
01:00:32,175 --> 01:00:36,669
- Once we back him down,
we got no more problems. You got me?
- Right.

755
01:00:39,382 --> 01:00:41,316
<i>[Unlocking Door]</i>

757
01:01:04,374 --> 01:01:06,308
Psst.

758
01:01:08,378 --> 01:01:11,643
Remember who we're
supposed to be.

759
01:01:22,792 --> 01:01:25,352
- [Shuddering]
- All right.

760
01:01:25,428 --> 01:01:27,953
Who's the number one
cock-a-doodle-doo around here?

761
01:01:28,031 --> 01:01:31,467
- W-What?
- "What?"

762
01:01:31,534 --> 01:01:34,128
[Grunts]

763
01:01:44,113 --> 01:01:47,446
- Now, who is he?
- It's-It's Mac! It's Mac!

764
01:01:47,517 --> 01:01:50,509
- Mac who?
- Uh, I don't know.

765
01:01:50,587 --> 01:01:53,147
They just call him "Big Mac."

766
01:01:53,223 --> 01:01:56,192
Where is this
Big Mac?

767
01:01:56,259 --> 01:01:58,955
I don't know.
[Panting]

768
01:01:59,028 --> 01:02:02,020
Not many of these fellas
have ever seen him.

769
01:02:02,098 --> 01:02:05,124
Big Mac don't,
don't never come out here
in the yard, n-never.

770
01:02:05,201 --> 01:02:09,137
Well, you get word
to this, uh, Big Mac...

771
01:02:09,205 --> 01:02:13,198
that the Apple Dumpling Gang
wants to see him.

772
01:02:13,276 --> 01:02:15,210
Okay?

773
01:02:15,278 --> 01:02:17,405
Uh-h-h,
Apple Dumpling Gang.

774
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,846
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

775
01:02:21,284 --> 01:02:23,844
[Straining]

776
01:02:26,189 --> 01:02:28,521
- Move out.
- Y-Yes, sir.

777
01:02:29,759 --> 01:02:31,989
- Move it!
<i>- [Gasps] Yes, sir!</i>

<i>[Bugle]</i>

780
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:50,039
Sometimes I wished we'd left
Marshal Hitchcock to his own devices.

781
01:02:50,113 --> 01:02:53,276
- How's he doing?
- He's been released from the infirmary.

782
01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:56,910
Not all together cured,
I'd say, but better.

783
01:02:56,986 --> 01:03:01,582
About the robberies, Jim,
I hate to pass on unfinished business...

784
01:03:01,658 --> 01:03:04,024
but I did everything
I knew how.

785
01:03:04,093 --> 01:03:06,118
You did everything
humanly possible.

786
01:03:06,195 --> 01:03:10,825
But it wasn't enough.
They stole another cavy
of horses just two days ago.

787
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:16,065
- I'm beginning to think
these raids are done by ghosts.
- It's uncanny, sir.

788
01:03:16,139 --> 01:03:19,267
Well, it's off
my shoulders now.

789
01:03:19,342 --> 01:03:21,435
Daddy, it's unfair.

790
01:03:21,511 --> 01:03:25,311
Nothing is fair
in this world, Millie.

791
01:03:25,381 --> 01:03:31,047
I'm sorry about your wedding plans,
but you could hardly stay here
under these conditions.

792
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:34,351
Now you know I'll be all right.
You don't have to worry about me.

793
01:03:34,424 --> 01:03:36,824
We'll be married just as soon
as I take my leave, sir.

794
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:48,363
Hey, Theodore, when we get
out of here in 30 years,
are we gonna go straight again?

795
01:03:48,438 --> 01:03:50,804
I'll think about that
when the time comes.

796
01:03:50,873 --> 01:03:55,105
Listen, did that guard
say to go left or right
when we passed them boilers?

797
01:03:55,178 --> 01:03:57,806
He said to go right.

798
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,316
This is a strange place
for a shipping room.

799
01:04:01,384 --> 01:04:06,048
I don't think we're supposed
to be down here. We must've
made a wrong turn somewhere.

800
01:04:08,925 --> 01:04:11,155
Uh, where...

801
01:04:19,602 --> 01:04:23,436
- [Gasping]
- Uh, Theodore?

802
01:04:26,642 --> 01:04:29,440
- Theodore, what did you do?
<i>- [Men Chattering]</i>

803
01:04:29,512 --> 01:04:32,845
- Shh.
<i>- [Man] It'll be a week</i>
<i>or so till we get the cash.</i>

804
01:04:32,915 --> 01:04:37,079
<i>- We'll make the split then.</i>
<i>- You did a goodjob. No witnesses.</i>

805
01:04:37,153 --> 01:04:40,088
<i>- That's the way I want it.</i>
- [Whispers] Amos.

806
01:04:40,156 --> 01:04:43,250
You boys have had it
pretty easy up till now.

807
01:04:43,326 --> 01:04:46,853
<i>But I wanna tell you,</i>
<i>holdin'up a train isn't easy</i>
<i>as them wagons.</i>

808
01:04:46,929 --> 01:04:49,727
There'll be plenty of guards
around that payroll.

809
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:51,926
We'll take care
of the guards.

810
01:04:52,001 --> 01:04:57,029
Reno, you're in charge.
Blainey, go along with him, make
sure there ain't no mistakes.

811
01:04:57,106 --> 01:05:00,564
Now I'll be waiting in the meadow
at the Cuddy Grade.

812
01:05:00,643 --> 01:05:05,171
You work your way up
to the baggage cart,
throw the money out there.

813
01:05:05,248 --> 01:05:08,740
<i>Stay on the train till you</i>
<i>get to Oakdale, then get off.</i>

814
01:05:08,818 --> 01:05:14,654
If everything goes well,
I figure we should be able to
meet back here in 45 minutes.

815
01:05:14,724 --> 01:05:17,420
An hour, at the outside.

816
01:05:17,493 --> 01:05:21,224
$50,000 an hour.
That's pretty good pay.

817
01:05:33,176 --> 01:05:35,804
[Gasps]

818
01:05:39,182 --> 01:05:43,278
Uh, could you direct us to the
Bridger Military Prison, please?

819
01:05:43,352 --> 01:05:45,980
Who the blazes are you?

820
01:05:46,055 --> 01:05:48,819
Ya ever hear of the
Apple Dumpling Gang, punk?

821
01:05:49,759 --> 01:05:51,693
Why didn't you say so?

822
01:05:51,761 --> 01:05:53,888
I hear you wanna see me.

823
01:05:53,963 --> 01:05:58,161
Maybe we do, maybe we don't.
Whose little boy are you?

824
01:05:58,234 --> 01:06:01,169
[Chuckling]

825
01:06:03,506 --> 01:06:05,497
I'm Mac.

826
01:06:05,575 --> 01:06:08,738
Mac who, fuzzy face?

827
01:06:23,025 --> 01:06:26,552
That Mac.
Probably wants to talk to you.

828
01:06:27,864 --> 01:06:31,561
Uh, we just wanted
to say howdy.

829
01:06:33,469 --> 01:06:35,528
Howdy.

830
01:06:35,605 --> 01:06:38,073
How long were you there
and what'd you hear?

831
01:06:38,141 --> 01:06:40,837
Oh, nothing.
We just got here, Mr. Mac.

832
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:43,902
We didn't hear nothing
about any train robbery, did we?

833
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:47,279
No, no. Didn't hear nothing
about the money either.

834
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:50,911
- Boys.
- Wait a minute.

835
01:06:52,255 --> 01:06:55,850
Mac, we can use a couple
of extra guns on this job.

836
01:06:57,293 --> 01:06:59,955
Yeah, I hear you boys
are pretty handy with the iron.

837
01:07:00,029 --> 01:07:04,864
That's right. Pound for pound,
we're the best in the West.

838
01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:08,530
<i>[Big Mac]</i>
<i>Well, good.</i>

839
01:07:08,604 --> 01:07:14,406
Yes. [Chuckling] Well, here.
We'll give you a chance to prove it.

840
01:07:22,552 --> 01:07:25,487
[Chuckling]

841
01:07:25,555 --> 01:07:28,080
Well, now that's
what I call shootin'.

842
01:07:28,157 --> 01:07:30,853
Maybe we can
use you boys.

843
01:07:30,927 --> 01:07:34,556
Uh, are you gentlemen
prisoners here?

844
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,564
When we feel like it.

845
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:42,098
<i>It ain't all that surprisin'</i>
<i>when you know the story.</i>

846
01:07:42,171 --> 01:07:45,402
See, Bridger here
was built by army prisoners.

847
01:07:45,474 --> 01:07:48,307
When they was digging the foundation,
they found these caverns.

848
01:07:48,377 --> 01:07:51,904
[Chuckling]
A few of the boys just
kept it under their hat.

849
01:07:51,981 --> 01:07:54,449
Figured they'd use it later
to bust out.

850
01:07:54,517 --> 01:07:57,748
[Chuckles]
But it turned out to be
the perfect hideout.

851
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:03,122
Now, where's the last place the
law would look for a person that
was robbin' a supply wagon?

852
01:08:03,192 --> 01:08:05,854
Why, that's a toughie.
Now, where is the last place...

853
01:08:05,928 --> 01:08:07,623
- Prison.
- Huh?

854
01:08:07,697 --> 01:08:10,427
You got a head
on you, boy.

855
01:08:10,499 --> 01:08:12,433
Just barely.

856
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:17,836
So we figured why bust out
and be on the dodge
the rest of our lives.

857
01:08:17,907 --> 01:08:22,037
Stay in prison and run the whole
operation from here. Live like kings.

858
01:08:22,111 --> 01:08:24,102
Come and go when we want.

859
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:27,775
Feel the need for a little relaxation,
a little female companionship...

860
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:29,715
we just ride into town.

861
01:08:29,785 --> 01:08:31,878
Makes life in prison
very comfortable.

862
01:08:31,954 --> 01:08:34,980
Does Warden Waddell
know about this?

863
01:08:35,057 --> 01:08:38,891
No! Nobody does,
but the seven of us.

864
01:08:38,961 --> 01:08:42,055
Well, nine of us now
and the outside man.

865
01:08:42,131 --> 01:08:45,828
- Who's that?
- You'll meet him when the time comes.

866
01:08:45,901 --> 01:08:48,836
The outside man lets us know
when there's a wagon...

867
01:08:48,904 --> 01:08:51,338
or a shipment coming through
with somethin' worthwhile on it.

868
01:08:51,407 --> 01:08:53,568
<i>He gets a cut</i>
<i>for his trouble.</i>

869
01:08:53,643 --> 01:08:56,840
<i>You'll get yours too</i>
<i>if you handle yourselves</i>
<i>all right.</i>

870
01:08:58,247 --> 01:09:00,875
We'll be watching ya.
[Chuckles]

871
01:09:04,987 --> 01:09:07,922
We'll slip into town
one or two at a time.

872
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:12,188
- You two know where your spot is?
- The Variety Saloon.

873
01:09:12,261 --> 01:09:15,196
I want everyone
in place at 12:00 sharp.

874
01:09:15,264 --> 01:09:17,323
And you better be there.

875
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,062
12:00 sharp.
Don't worry.

876
01:09:20,136 --> 01:09:22,696
Giddap!
Come on!

877
01:09:26,309 --> 01:09:30,245
You know, Theodore.
Robbin' army payroll
ain't exactly goin' straight.

878
01:09:30,313 --> 01:09:34,079
We ain't robbed no payroll yet, Amos,
and we ain't goin' to.

879
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:36,175
I'm thinkin' on a plan.

880
01:09:36,252 --> 01:09:38,482
Better come up with it by noon.

881
01:09:38,554 --> 01:09:41,648
If you don't have it by noon...
Wait for me.

882
01:09:43,592 --> 01:09:46,891
All we gotta do
is have the sheriff in this town...

883
01:09:46,962 --> 01:09:49,260
Iock us up
under protective custody.

884
01:09:49,332 --> 01:09:53,325
Then we just lay back and let him
handle the rest. We'll be heroes.

885
01:09:59,008 --> 01:10:03,604
If you're looking for Sheriff Vaughn,
he's over at the Widow Bradshaw's.

886
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:07,171
<i>Seems a fox has been gettin'</i>
<i>into her chicken house again.</i>

887
01:10:07,249 --> 01:10:12,084
Hmm! Usually takes the sheriff
about a week to settle the matter.

888
01:10:12,154 --> 01:10:14,918
- A week?
- Yeah, we can't... A week?

889
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:18,824
We can't wait a week.
I mean, already the little hand's
on 12, big hand's on 11.

890
01:10:18,894 --> 01:10:22,352
<i>You need a lawman, the federal marshal's</i>
<i>down at the Variety's.</i>
