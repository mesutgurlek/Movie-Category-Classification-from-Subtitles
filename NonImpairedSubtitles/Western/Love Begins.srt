Anything to drink?

158
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,715
Water will be fine. Thank you.

159
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,481
All right.

160
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:04,156
Well, this sure seems like
a real quiet town.

161
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:07,096
{Chuckles}
I'd hate to be stuck here.

162
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,099
Well, a lot of people
like living like that.

163
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,329
Yeah, well, not me.
Excitement's what I crave.

164
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,164
Ladies, good day to you.

165
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,106
Uh, I don't mean to be rude.

166
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,940
My name is Daniel Whittaker.
Well, what are your names?

167
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,006
{Woman Clears Throat}

168
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,608
Well, don't that just say it all, hmm?

169
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,518
I'm being real nice,
and these ladies are being rude.

170
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,683
How about we just eat and get out of here?

171
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,886
You know, I'm being real
friendly like to you women...

172
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,520
and I can't even get
a simple hello in return?

173
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,462
Hello.

174
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:43,364
- Excuse me?
- You said you wanted a hello. I gave you one.

175
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:47,235
- I wanted it from these ladies.
- Well, it seems they don't want conversation with you.

176
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,364
Well, you two ought to mind
your own business.

177
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,205
Now... Ah...
Ladies, you don't have to go nowhere.

178
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,375
Daniel, we isn’t looking for no trouble.

179
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,749
No, we're not.
But it seems like these two boys are.

180
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,583
No, we isn’t looking for trouble.

181
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:06,715
But if you insist, we can step outside.

182
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:11,286
Look at it this way.
Walk away now, and you don't get hurt.

183
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,298
John, Samuel, what is going' on?

184
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,732
What's it going to be? The streets...

185
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,736
or walk away?

186
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,635
- {Woman Screams}
- {All Gasp}

187
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,937
{All Grunting}

188
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,603
Stop it!

189
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,508
{Shouting}

190
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,653
{Gasps} Stop it.

191
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,189
{Millie}
You listen to me. I said stop it!

192
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,348
Stop it!

193
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,495
- {Shouting}
- {Rose} I got the flour.

194
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,689
{Screams}

195
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,699
{Grunting}

196
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,478
Get up!

197
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,378
I will shoot the man
who throws the next punch.

198
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:12,787
Matter of fact,
this old scattershot isn’t too choosy.

199
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,827
She might just get all of you.
Put your hands up and sit down.

200
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,828
- But, Sheriff, these two...
- I said sit.

201
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,932
{Man}
Run those boys out of town.

202
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,297
{Woman}
They need to cool their heels, Sheriff.

203
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,235
{Chattering}

204
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,305
Millicent!

205
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,374
- I'd like to know what happened here.
- Well, I was in the kitchen.

206
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,677
Ellen came to get me,
and I came out just as the fight started.

207
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,746
Well, let's get this sorted out, boys.

208
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,069
Step inside, gentlemen.

209
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:06,737
Uh, our horses are tied up on the street.

210
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,872
Don't go fretting about your horses.
I'll see they end up at the stables.

211
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,950
Of course, it'll cost you for board.

212
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,878
Pick a bunk.

213
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,154
{Sighs}

214
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:22,523
I'm not sure how this is real fair, Sheriff.
Those two boys were just as guilty as we were.

215
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,358
Witnesses say your friend here
threw the first punch.

216
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,796
- Well, they provoked me.
- Is that all you have to say?

217
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,428
What about you?
What do you got to say for yourself?

218
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,903
Never did get a chance to eat.
Little hungry.

219
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,839
I'll order you up some food from Millie's.

220
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,644
If she'll feed you after what happened.

221
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,714
I'm much obliged, Sheriff.

222
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,588
"Never did get a chance to eat"?

223
00:14:56,695 --> 00:15:00,187
That... That's all you've got to say?
We just got railroaded.

224
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:06,168
You caused this, again, and you know it.

225
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,743
The next big wind, and this is coming down.

226
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:16,281
That's why we'll have to
get the newest posts in before then.

227
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,283
You and me aren't so good
at digging postholes.

228
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,250
We'll learn. Grab the hammer and nails.

229
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,981
We'll get the plank up so we can
get the horses back in the corral.

230
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,321
{Sighs} Why did God bring
such a terrible storm on us?

231
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:32,329
Pa used to say the good Lord and the devil got
credit for things they had nothing to do with.

232
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:38,301
- {Sighs}
- Sometimes things just happen, natural course of events.

233
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,895
Sometimes it's all so confounding'.

234
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,531
That's why we have to have
the faith of a child.

235
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,877
Sure was exciting at Millie's today.

236
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,951
- I guess you could call it that.
- What else would you call it?

237
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,520
Crude and rude behaviour.

238
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,355
Let's get the plank up.

239
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,664
{Horse Whinnies}

240
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,908
- Hello, Rose.
- Hello, Sheriff.

241
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,810
Ma made this for the prisoners.

242
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,850
You can go on in. They're harmless.

243
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,382
Hello there, little lady. And you are?

244
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,017
I'm Rose. I'm Millie's daughter.

245
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,686
Oh. Well...

246
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,862
{Sniffs}
Oh, that smells tasty, Rose.

247
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,663
You know, Mama is mighty mad at you two
for wrecking her place...

248
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,398
but she decided to make that up
for you anyways.

249
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,269
Said it was the Christian thing to do.

250
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,933
Thank you. We're very grateful.

251
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,238
Thank you, Rose.

252
00:16:57,082 --> 00:17:00,347
Well, one good thing...
We got our chicken and dumplings.

253
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:03,012
You boys want some water,
you can call the night deputy.

254
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,057
When you're finished with your food,
slide the plates under the door.

255
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,319
And I'll see you in the morning.

256
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,354
Hey, Sheriff.

257
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,562
What's going to happen to us?

258
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,430
- Depends.
- Depends on what?

259
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,561
If you plead guilty...

260
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,696
you pay the assessed damages plus a fine.

261
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,435
- What are the damages?
- Well, I haven't calculated that yet.

262
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,377
The window's boarded up. I have no idea how
much the new glass and repairs will cost.

263
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,040
Plus a table, chair or two.

264
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,879
Yeah, well, we're pleading not guilty.

265
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,818
Fine. When the judge hits town,
we'll hold a hearing in the jail.

266
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,116
- When the judge hits town?
- Yeah.

267
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,920
Circuit judge. Covers all the counties.
Should be back here in about 30 days.

268
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,291
I isn’t staying
in this jail for a month.

269
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:48,162
- Well, then you'd best plead guilty.
- Well, that isn’t justice.

270
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:52,601
- I-I don't know what that is, but it sure isn’t justice.
- We'll plead guilty.

271
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,729
No, we're not!

272
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,273
Well...

273
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,110
I can see you boys
need some time to talk it over.

274
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,510
Take the night.

275
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,515
This isn’t fair, Clark,
and we're not pleading guilty.

276
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,591
You did throw the first punch.

277
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,592
We got about three dollars between us.

278
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,594
The-That won't even cover a new window.

279
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:20,927
Well, maybe we can work it off.

280
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,695
Not me, old buddy.
I got bigger and better things to do...

281
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,997
places to go, things to see.

282
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,369
In case you hadn't noticed,
we're in a jail cell.

283
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,602
Well, there isn’t a jail built
I can't bust out of.

284
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,372
Neither one of us has ever been locked up
before. What are you talking about?

285
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,540
You got no imagination, Clark.
You never did.

286
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,310
It's part of your charm, I guess.

287
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,148
Just eat your food and go to bed.

288
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,864
{Snoring}

289
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,012
{Snoring Continues}

290
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,188
{Snoring Continues}

291
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,584
They'll shoot you.

292
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,390
It's not too late. Come with me.

293
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,225
You really think you're going to
get away with this?

294
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,800
Use your head for once,
and let's pay our debt.

295
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,772
We didn't come this far
just so we could sit behind bars.

296
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,537
If we don't get out of here now,
we're never going to make it to California.

297
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,545
- Grow up and be a man.
- Good luck, Clark.

298
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,716
Look me up when you get out west.

299
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,648
If you ever make it that far.

300
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,596
{Murmurs}

301
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,530
{Snoring}

302
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,511
{Sighs Deeply}

00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,816

{Horse Knickers}

307
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:57,139
I gathered the eggs.
The hens didn't do so well laying.

308
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,183
Maybe the storm scared 'em.

309
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,979
They'll settle down.

310
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,748
- Do you want some help in the garden?
- That would be great.

311
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:09,360
You know, if we made the garden bigger,
we could grow more stuff to sell.

312
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:12,988
We could, after we fix the shingles
on the roof of the house...

313
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,032
and repair the barn door.

314
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,658
And get the new corral posts up.

315
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,896
{Both Chuckle}

316
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,099
We weren't this close
when Pa was alive, were we?

317
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,675
No.

318
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,204
Why do you think that is?

319
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:30,781
I suppose it's the age difference.

320
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:37,014
And I was caught up in the trifles
that tend to divert a young woman.

321
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,420
You mean Jake?

322
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,389
Yes, Jake.

323
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,765
- Do you miss him?
- I try not to think of it.

324
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,825
It's been over two years,
and you haven't heard a word from him.

325
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:55,236
- Do you think he's dead?
- I don't know.

326
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,740
Well, if he wasn't dead...

327
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:01,711
he would have written or sent
some kind of word from the goldfields.

328
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,077
We parted on disagreeable terms.

329
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,146
You part that way with a loved one, it...

330
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,153
tends to make any loss more grievous.

331
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,246
Was he your true love?

332
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:15,588
You need years with someone
to know such a thing.

333
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:19,892
True love is born of experience,
not fairy dust.

334
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:22,398
Do you think I'll find my true love?

335
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,064
Yes, you will.

336
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,134
But first I need your help
clearing this garden.

337
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,245
{Horse Whinnies}

338
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,354
What have you got to say for yourself?

339
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,685
When I went back to check on 'em,
the cell door was open.

340
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,089
One was gone.
The other one was just sitting' there.

341
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,627
- Excuse me?
- I don't know how it happened.

342
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:54,631
I'll tell you how it happened. You fell asleep,
and a prisoner escaped using a dinner fork.

343
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,964
I ought to lock you up in his place.

344
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,594
Get out of here.
I'll figure out what to do with you later.

345
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,103
Well, Mr. Clark Davis,
looks like you're on your own.

346
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,543
Appears so.

347
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:11,013
Mr. Whittaker skipped over to the stable,
broke in...

348
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,550
took his horse and beat it out of town.

349
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,313
Sounds about right.

350
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,048
- Don't suppose you know anything about this.
- I'm here, aren't I?

351
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,989
Yes, you are.

352
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:30,367
- I was sleeping'.
- You and my deputy both.

353
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,563
I woke up,
and Daniel was fooling with the lock.

354
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,503
I tried to talk him out of it.

355
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:39,043
- I suppose you're going after him now?
- Waste of my time.

356
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,840
He'll just end up on the wrong side
of the law someplace else...

357
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,642
if the devil don't get him first.

358
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,716
I will put his name out on the wire though.

359
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,377
We've been friends since childhood.

360
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,183
I'd be careful who I'd call friend.

361
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,985
{Sighs}
I pled guilty. Now what?

362
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:00,291
The fine for public nuisance is $10.

363
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:03,196
The repairs at Millie's
will probably be about 30.

364
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,072
I got $1.50.

365
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:21,585
That'll cover about three weeks' board
on your horse over at the stable.

366
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,086
I'll go get you some breakfast
since you'll be staying here.

367
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,054
- Sheriff, wait.
- What is it now?

368
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,955
Isn't there some way I could work it off?

369
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,434
Hyah.

370
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,744
{Chattering}

371
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,789
{Horse Whinnies}

372
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,728
{Horse Blusters}

373
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,723
Millicent, can I have a word with you?

374
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,304
I'd like to run something by you
concerning this young man.

375
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,468
I'm listening.

376
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,134
Sit.

377
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,577
So, what's this all about?
Where's the other one?

378
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:29,211
Slipped out last night
while my deputy was sleeping.

379
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:33,781
Came in this morning, and this one's
just sitting there. The door's wide open.

380
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,656
Now why do you suppose he didn't leave?

381
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:42,461
I believe he is a responsible young man who
would like to do right by you and the town.

382
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,762
In fact, that's what I came
to talk to you about.

383
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:47,269
I'm still listening'.

384
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,844
{Holden}
Won't be much further now.

385
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,973
{Clark}
Do you mind if I ask where we're going?

386
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,881
Nope.

387
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,315
No, you don't mind, or no, don't ask?

388
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,822
Barlow Farm.

389
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,086
Ellen Barlow lives there
with her sister Cassie.

390
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,128
They've been looking for some hired help.

391
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:14,790
Can't pay much, but it'll suit your needs
paying off what you owe.

392
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:19,802
- Two women living alone?
- Pa died last winter. Mom died giving birth to Cassie.

393
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,074
And you're trusting me not to run?

394
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,075
You give me your word you'll stay?

395
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:28,475
You have my word on it.

396
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,810
Your word's good enough for me.

397
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,440
But if you run, I will find you...

398
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,451
and I may have to shoot you.

399
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,668
{Whinnies}

400
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,240
You can make camp up there.

401
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,209
Close to work, out of the ladies' hair.

402
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,279
Plenty of game up there. You'll make do.

403
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,406
Ellen! Cassie!

404
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,087
Ellen, it's Sheriff Holden.

405
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,553
Hello, Sheriff.

406
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:16,024
- Good day to you, Sheriff.
- Ellen.

407
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:19,153
That fellow with the sheriff is the one
that was in the fight at Millie's.

408
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:21,164
Yes, it seems so.

409
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,734
Sheriff, what can we do for you today?

410
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,827
It's what I can do for you.

411
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:29,406
Ellen Barlow, Cassie Barlow,
meet Clark Davis.

412
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,407
The solution to your hired hand problem.

413
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:38,280
Sheriff Holden, why don't you step down
so we can talk in private?

414
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,475
Yes, ma'am.

415
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,117
Cassie...

416
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,212
make sure he don't run off.

417
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,086
{Cassie Sighs}

418
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,717
You and those other fellas
sure tore up Millie's place.

419
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:52,661
Yeah, we sure did.
I'm really sorry about that.

420
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:55,995
It was a grand fight.
Grandest fight I ever saw.

421
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,695
In fact, the only fight I ever saw.

422
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,828
Rose too. Rose is Millie's daughter.

423
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:04,568
Cassie, hold the horse. Stop talking.

424
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,642
Why'd you bring that criminal here?

425
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,806
- {Holden} He's not a criminal.
- Then what is he?

426
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,578
He's an able-bodied man who will work
for you to pay off Millie and the law.

427
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,745
He started a brawl. He can't be trusted.

428
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,187
First of all, he did not start the brawl.
Millie and you said so.

429
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,554
- That is beside the point.
- No, it is not beside the point.

430
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,993
And secondly, I'm a damn good judge of human
nature, and that boy has a good, solid character.

431
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,497
You have only known him for a day.

432
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,194
The other one broke out of jail and took off.
This one stayed to face the music.

433
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:32,860
That tells me a lot about his character.

434
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,533
We'll find someone else.

435
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,201
Ellen Barlow,
you are as stubborn as your old man.

436
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,939
Besides, there is no one else,
and you sorely need him.

437
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:48,316
Fine.

438
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,183
But only on a trial basis.
One week at a time.

439
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,452
Minus the $1.50 he already paid,
he owes 38.50.

440
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,550
A month's wages ought to cover that debt.

441
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:59,061
I told him he could
camp up there on the hill.

442
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,400
- Thank you, Cassie.
- You're welcome, Sheriff.

443
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,025
{Horse Whinnies}

444
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:09,299
- You leaving?
- Appears so.

445
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:12,171
Don't you worry. I'll be back
to check on you from time to time.

446
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,905
- Good-bye, Sheriff.
- Stay out of trouble, Cassie.

447
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:16,708
You too, Sheriff.

448
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,280
- {Clicking Tongue}
- Cassie.

449
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,920
{Horse Whinnies}

450
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,422
Miss Barlow, I just want to tell you
it's a pleasure to meet you...

451
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:28,424
and, uh, I really appreciate
this job opportunity.

452
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,653
Look, Mr... {Sighs}
What's your name?

453
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,593
It's Davis. Clark Davis.

454
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:36,326
Mr. Davis, I truly do not feel comfortable
having the likes of you around...

455
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:39,835
but we need some hired help,
and you're all there seems to be.

456
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,998
- The likes of me?
- I heard your friend say you were going to the goldfields.

457
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:46,702
- Is there something' wrong with that?
- Dreamers, chasing' rainbows...

458
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:48,745
looking' for gold, get rich quick.

459
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,439
Well, there is gold to be found.

460
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:53,278
Look. If you're going to work here,
you best get started.

461
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:57,286
Half a day's already gone. If I'm going to pay
you a daily wage, I expect a full day's work.

462
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,754
Yes, ma'am. You'll get a full day's work.
Just tell me where to start.

463
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,053
Well, there's plenty that needs attention.

464
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,287
You can start by fixing the barn door.

465
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,000
Okay.

466
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,264
She's not so ornery
once you get to know her.

467
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,398
I might not live long enough
to get to know her then.

468
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:21,308
There's tools and a ladder in the barn,
and the lumber's out back.

469
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:23,812
Come on. I'll show you, Mr. Davis.

470
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:27,146
Just call me Clark. Mr. Davis is my pa.

471

{Cow Moos}

472
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,486
You best be careful up there.

473
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:36,151
I will. Thanks for the advice.

474
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,765
- You sure you know what you're doing?
- Well...

475
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,563
guess we're going to find out.

476
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,068
Cassie, would you come here, please?

477
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,835
{Sighs}
Got to go see what she wants.

478
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:01,643
- {Sighs} Do you need me?
- Of course I need you.

479
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,881
- But I'm helping with the barn door.
- Come on inside the house.

480
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,650
{Sighs}

481
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,832
Did you want to talk about something?

482
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,812
I think it's better if we maintain a
distance from him till we get to know him.

483
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:32,508
How do we get to know him
if we maintain a distance?

484
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:37,213
We know nothing' about him except he started
a fight, and he got thrown in jail.

485
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,688
Now, please,
just stay away from him for now.

486
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,726
I best get back. He may need my help.

487
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:45,125
Cassandra Mae, did you hear a word I said?

488
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:48,221
Every word, Ellen Louise.

489
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,008
{Sighs} You fixed it.

490
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,381
{Exhales} Hope so.

491
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:18,657
Sometimes I have to remind Ellen
that she is my sister and not my mother.

492
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,095
- She's concerned for you.
- I can take care of myself.

493
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:24,032
Oh, yes, ma'am. I'm sure you can.

494
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,235
Heading' to California...
that sounds so very exciting'.

495
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,172
Your sister don't seem to think so.

496
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:33,766
- That's 'cause of Jake.
- Jake?

497
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:36,779
Jake Weller. He was Ellen's sweetheart.

498
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:40,817
Moved to California with gold fever
about two years ago.

499
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:43,910
He wanted her to pack up and go with him,
but she didn't want that.

500
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:47,389
- Yeah? What happened to him?
- Don't know. Haven't heard a word from him.

501
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,457
Well...

502
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,222
that could prejudice someone
against the pursuit of gold.

503
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,061
Yes, sir, it could.
She has very hard feelings against it too.

504
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:59,933
Yeah, seems so. Hey, would you grab that
two-by-four and slide it right under this door?

505
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,374
Thank you. You're a real big help.

506
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,811
- Really?
- Really.

- {Grunts}

509
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,050
I believe so.

510

00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:54,458
So far.

512
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:00,494
It's working.

513
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,327
Well, it's staying on the hinges.

514
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,128
That's the important part.

515
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,829
Cassie, we need to
take my mending to town and deliver it.

516
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,873
- Go pack the wagon and get ready to go.
- Can't I stay here?

517
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:12,738
I thought we'd go by Millie's for lunch.
You can catch up with Rose.

518
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,972
- I'm going.
- I'll hitch the team.

519
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,139
Well, looks like you fixed it.

520
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,410
Seems like it.

521
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,349
Can I give you a hand with that team?

522
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,786
No, that won't be necessary.
I can manage on my own.

523
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,154
Okay. What do you have in mind next?

524
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:32,389
Corral. One of the posts has rotted out.
Other three need mending.

525
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:36,024
The new posts are behind the barn, and all
the tools you'll need are inside the barn.

526
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,003
I'll get right on it.

528

to the dry goods store.

<i>Rose and I.</i>

530
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:55,080
All right. Rose and I are
going to the dry goods store.

531
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,882
And please remember
to see if my gingham material's come in.

532
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,150
You'll be back in time for the supper rush?

533
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,419
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thanks.

534
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:09,392
I have to admit.
That fight was pretty exciting.

535
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,161
Oh, I don't know.

536
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:15,000
I take it you have a hired hand
working for you now?

537
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,768
Trial basis, one week at a time.

538
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:20,867
I don't know how I feel
about trusting a man who gets in a fight.

539
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:24,436
Well, the sheriff brought him by here.
Seemed like a pretty solid fella.

540
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,517
We'll see.

541
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:28,551
And he's not too disagreeable to look at.

542
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,746
{Chuckles} Millie, please.

543
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,223
I hadn't noticed.

When you're finished with that post, Mr...
Mr. Davis...

554

don't forget the other
three that are loose.

I won't forget.

Yes?

00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:06,675
You know, I never intended on being here.

559
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,048
If I could have repaid that debt,
I would have.

560
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:11,451
But I gave the sheriff
my word I would see this through.

561
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:14,115
- Your point is?
- Long as I'm here, I'm going to be civil to you.

562
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,125
All I ask is you do the same in return.

<i>Isn't he.</i>

568
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:41,417
He has motive to be. Once he pays
off his debt, he'll be on his way.

569
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,817
He's not like the other

He hums while he works.

Pa was always humming while he was working'.

574

Does this fella remind you of Pa?

I've never heard

599
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,901
'Cause you're getting so tall,
the dress is looking too short.

I can hear that. There's no law against it.

You know, this time of year,
we could get another storm.

I didn't even hear you ride up.

618
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,645
My grandpa was half Osage.

619
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:32,682
He'd sneak up on a rabbit,
grab it by the ears with one hand.

620
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:34,478
- You just riding by?
- Nope.

621
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:38,678
Rode out to check on you,
like I said I would.

622
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,950
You holding up all right?

623
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,720
Uh... {Chuckles}
Yes, sir.

624
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:47,888
Ellen's a tad pushy and a bit headstrong,
but she's a good person.

625
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:51,092
She's guilty on the first two counts,
but I haven't seen the nice part yet.

626
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,793
Few do.

627
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,463
Gal's got a... heavy burden...

628
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,973
what with keeping this place going
and raising Cassie.

629
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,202
Yes, sir. Well...

630
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,279
Well, I'm still here, so you can rest easy.

631
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:07,146
I knew you were a man of your word.
But I never rest easy. You'll be seeing me again.

632
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,446
I'll count on it.

633
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:12,078
Got an answer back on that wire I sent out
on Daniel Whittaker.

634
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:16,125
Turns out he got himself arrested
for rustling a few counties west of here.

635
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:19,587
- Are they going to hang him?
- Could be.

636
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:23,690
Funny how life is. If you'd been with him,
you could be facing the noose.

637
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,792
But here you are.

638
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,871
{Whinnies}

639
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,439
Hyah! Hyah!

640
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,975
Yeah, here I am.

641
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:37,711
You make the best apple pie
this side of the Mississippi.

642
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:39,646
<i>What's wrong with my apple pie?</i>

643
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,514
Nothing'.
It just comes second to Millie's.

644
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,953
You are too kind.
So how's your hired hand doing?

645
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:49,457
He allows me to help.
And he treats me like an adult.

646
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,824
Unlike someone else I know.

647
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,988
He seems to be a hard worker.

648
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:56,032
Ellen's being kind of ornery with him.

649
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,034
He works for us.
We're not meant to be his friend.

650
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,900
Well, you can be kind of ornery
with a lot of folks.

651
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:04,133
Well, some folks deserve it.

652
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:09,244
{Chuckles}

653
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,116

654
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,918
## {Humming}

655
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,327
Hello.

656
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:27,029
- Morning'.
- Morning'.

657
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:30,666
You're almost finished with the corral.

658
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,668
Couple more planks, it'll be there.

659
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,330
I'm going to go pick
wildflowers in the meadow.

660
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,066
Maybe one day you can pick some for me.

661
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,142
Sure. Just tell me when.

662
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:44,270
Miss Barlow, how are you?

663
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:45,848
Fine.

664
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:53,923
- You do good work.
- Thank you.

665
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,821
My pa taught me a lot about carpentry.

666
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:57,587
Come in real handy around here.

667
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:03,361
So, you have a trade, yet you decide to
waste your life on trivial pursuits.

668
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:07,028
{Chuckles} I guess you just got me
all figured out, don't you, Miss Barlow?

669
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:11,665
Well, I don't understand how a man
can leave his family and his home...

670
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:13,606
and travel clear across the country...

671
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,578
in pursuit of a few little rocks,
no matter how much they're worth.

672
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,945
Well, I think some men
are just in pursuit of a better life.

673
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,779
Others want a shortcut.

674
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,445
I was in it for the adventure.

675
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:33,822
So, what's next?

676
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:36,629
After you leave here?

677
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,668
Probably keep heading west.

678
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:41,932
Catch a steamer out of San Francisco.
Head on over to China.

679
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,267
China?

680
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:47,176
New adventure. New places. New people.

681
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:51,236
Doesn't sound like you have
any plans to settle down anytime soon.

682
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,816
One day I would like to settle down.

683
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,612
Have a family.

684
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:02,859
## {Humming}

685
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:12,459
{Chickens Clucking}

686
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:16,061
Chickens have been laying real good
since you got here. Think they like ya.

687
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:19,006
Yeah? Guess that makes me
a regular ol' rooster, huh?

688
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:22,375
There's a dance in town this Saturday.

689
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:23,969
Never been to a dance.

690
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:28,177
There's plenty of good food,
socializing and music.

691
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,186
- Are you and your sister going'?
- Never miss it.

692
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,654
- Maybe you could go with us?
- You have to ask Ellen that.

693
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:35,725
{Ellen} Ask Ellen what?

694
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:40,022
Well? I'm waiting'.

695
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,961
Could he go to the dance with us?

696
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:46,327
Well, if he wants to, all right.

697
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,870
No, that's all right. I, uh...

698
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,735
I don't have any fancy clothes anyway.

699
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:53,537
I think we could find him a suit to wear.

700
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:01,283
## {Folk}

701
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,590
{Chattering}

702
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:14,926
{Man} Good to see ya again.

703
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:22,771
Sure hope this suit looks all right.

704
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:26,400
Looks better than all right.
Fits you better than it did Pa.

705
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:31,944
You look beautiful.

706
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:34,677
I haven't worn this dress
in over two years.

707
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:37,182
Not since Jake left.

708
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:40,222
Cassie told me about him.

709
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:43,418
She can't keep her mouth shut
to save her soul.

710
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,256
You still look very fetching.

711
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,997
I took it out of the closet just for today.

712
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:50,726
## {Ends}

713
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:55,635
Ellen.

714
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,434
Look at you all slicked up.

715
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:00,971
There'll be no trouble here, boys.

716
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:04,479
Ah, we isn’t looking' for any trouble,
Sheriff. Isn’t that right, John?

717
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:06,208
Nah, just commenting'
on how different he looks.

718
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:07,908
What is it that you boys want?

719
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:09,747
Just wanted to shake this fella's hand.

720
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:13,914
And to tell him we feel
partially responsible for his trouble.

721
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,424
- Yeah, you mean that?
- My word on it.

722
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:21,053
Bygones are bygones.

723
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,893
Enjoy the dance.

724
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:29,467
- ## {Resumes}
- You do look very spiffy.

725
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:34,910
Come on. Let's dance.

726
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:38,448
John, would you be a dear
and get me a punch?

727
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:39,913
My pleasure. Ellen?

728
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:42,076
No, thanks. I'm fine.

729
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,657
{Chattering}

730
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:52,126
So, will we be seeing Mr. Davis
at services tomorrow?

731
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:56,029
I mentioned it to him on the way here.
Seems he's not a spiritual man.

732
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:59,102
Oh, my. That's too bad.

733
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:00,863
Do you find him handsome?

734
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,461
You know I do.

735
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:08,344
I find him passable at best.

736
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:13,710
Okay, slightly more than passable.

737
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,514
He's a hard worker. Good craftsman.

738
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,318
Seemingly of pleasant nature.

739
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:25,555
He's got a good spirit.
Just needs a little cultivating'.

740
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,892
And he'll be leaving soon.

741
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,634
- ## {Ends}
- {Chuckles}

742
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:34,431
Thank you for the dance,
kind sir.

743
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:36,199
My pleasure, madam.

744
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:41,238
Some fine dancing' out there, Mr. Davis.

745
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,040
You should dance with him, Ellen.

746
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:46,013
Now, Cassie,
normally the fella asks the gal to dance.

747
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,311
Well, ask her.

748
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,215
May I have this dance?

749
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,255
You may.

750
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:55,917
## {Waltz}

751
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:57,823
I'm going to go find Rose.

752
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:08,736
- Oh, they make a fine-looking couple.
- That they do.

753
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,343
Now, Millie...

754
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,140
don't you go playing' Cupid.

755
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:19,147
That boy is set on leaving'.

756
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:23,213
We'll see.

757
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,016
Cassie's so eager to grow up.

758
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:29,722
I can remember wanting' to grow up.

759
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:31,225
Have you?

760
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:34,692
I think so.

761
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,566
I know what I want now.

762
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:43,571
So many of the things that I thought
were the most important in the world...

763
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:46,198
well, they turned out not to be.

764
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:48,743
I owe you an apology.

765
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:53,077
I don't think so.

766
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:57,950
When you first came into our lives,
I prejudged you.

767
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:01,381
But you're not the person
I believed you to be.

768
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,322
You don't have to do that. It's fine.

769
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:05,088
Let me finish.

770
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:08,995
I feel like... I'm getting to know you.

771
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:13,161
The real you, not my perception of you.

772
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:16,333
I mean, I like you.

773
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:19,336
I like you too.

774
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,335
{Knickers}

775
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:03,474
Cassie, you best hurry.
We don't want to be late for service.

776
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:05,054
I'm coming'!

777
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,716
Good morning'.

778
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:11,622
Morning'.

779
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:14,219
Saw the team hitched up.
Figured y'all was heading' off to church.

780
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:17,596
We don't have a church in the usual sense.

781
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,896
Services are held outside
in the common area.

782
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:21,334
I see.

783
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:25,272
Well, I invited you once before,
and... I shall do it again.

784
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,104
Would you care to join us?

785
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:30,407
I do appreciate the offer, but I think
I'm going to stay here and tend to the garden.

786
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:32,482
We could all use an ounce of faith.

787
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:35,881
Miss Barlow, I'm not even sure
if I know what that word means.

788
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:40,582
Faith means believing' in something' greater
than oneself. A higher power.

789
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,351
Well, if it's all the same...

790
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:44,518
I think I'll spend my day doing something
a little more constructive.

791
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:48,029
<i>Worship is constructive, Mr. Davis.</i>

792
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:50,099
It's the most important work of all.

793
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,294
Well, if it's okay with you,
we'll just agree to disagree on that one.

794
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:55,200
But I do appreciate the offer to the dance.

795
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:57,739
You're welcome.

796
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:01,010
Cassandra!

797
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:04,842
Morning', Clark.

798
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:07,382
Cassie, please, in the wagon.

799
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:09,418
I don't want to be late.

800
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,587
Let me help you up.

801
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:26,766
We always have a potluck after services.

802
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,031
- You'll have to scrounge for your lunch.
- I'll make do.

803
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:31,039
- {Reins Snap}
- {Whinnies}

804
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,820
## {Humming}

805
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:53,653
- Mr. Davis.
- Miss Barlow.

806
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:57,927
It's the end of the week. Your pay.

807
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:01,094
- Wasn't Miss Millie at the service?
- She was.

808
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:05,766
- You can just give it to her.
- No, it's not my place.

809
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,570
It's better if you do.

810
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:09,838
All right. Thank you.

811
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:19,414
The garden is looking wonderful.

812
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:21,888
Thank you.
The, uh, tomato's looking' real ripe.

813
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,926
Eggplant's just about ready to be picked.

814
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:25,927
We can take it into town tomorrow.

815
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:28,623
I sell most of my crops
at the general store.

816
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:31,565
- You can visit Millie then.
- Sure thing.

817
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:34,429
You know, I'm just about done here...

818
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:37,165
so I'll probably pack up my stuff
and head back up to camp.

819
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:44,507
- We're just about to sit for Sunday supper.
- Is that an invitation?

820
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:48,846
It's the proper Sunday thing to do,
Mr. Davis.

821
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,852
Well, then I'd be obliged to accept.

822
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,785
Miss Barlow.

823
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:58,918
Perhaps since you and I are going to share
Sunday supper together...

824
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:01,020
maybe we can call each other
by our given names.

825
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:04,259
All right.
{Chuckles}

826
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:07,063
You best wash up before you come inside.

827
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,694
Sure thing, Ellen.

828
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:15,043
{Sighs}

829
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:21,845
- Cassie, did you pick those flowers?
- For you. Just like you asked.

830
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:26,185
You wouldn't mind if I took 'em tomorrow
when we go into town, would ya?

831
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:28,086
They're yours to do as you like with them.

832
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:32,092
I find gardening
very relaxing and enjoyable.

833
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:34,425
Plant some seeds, add some water...

834
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:38,194
a little sunlight,
and life magically springs from the ground.

835
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:41,464
That sounds so very poetic.

836
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:43,596
I hear what you're saying'.
I feel the same way.

837
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:47,768
We've been wanting' to expand our garden,
grow some more vegetables.

838
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:50,539
I might be able to help with that.

839
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:52,444
With the boss's permission.

840
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:55,575
I suppose that would be all right.

841
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,051
Probably just need some wildflower seeds,
we'll plant around the garden.

842
00:55:58,154 --> 00:55:59,746
It'll look real nice.

843
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:03,587
- Who wants to say grace?
- I'll say it. It's my turn anyway.

844
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:07,390
Mr. Davis... I mean, Clark,
would that be all right with you?

845
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:09,431
It's perfectly all right.

846
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,973
Lord, thank you for this food
that we are about to receive...

847
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:24,945
and thank you for our new friend Clark.

848
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,948
Please watch over him.

849
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:31,043
Even though he doesn't much believe in you,
he's still a kind and decent man.

850
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,622
Also, please keep watch over Ma and Pa.

851
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,556
Your friend, Cassie Barlow. Amen.

852
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,061
See? That wasn't so hard.

853
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,801
I really appreciate the hospitality.

854
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:52,671
I really enjoyed the meal and the company.
Especially the company.

855
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:55,404
- You're quite welcome.
- Maybe we can do it again.

856
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:57,241
It was special for Sunday.

857
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:59,110
Maybe again next Sunday?

858
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,445
Maybe.

859
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:05,510
Cassie was thinking' you'd be more comfortable
sleeping' in the barn instead of outside.

860
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:06,816
There's an old cot and everything.

861
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,584
You'd have a roof over your head.

862
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:10,318
Are you sure?

863
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,555
She asked you. Of course she's sure.

864
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:17,590
Well, I, uh... I better be up early...

865
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,930
get the squash and tomatoes picked
and packed up for town.

866
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:22,561
- I'll help you.
- After your house chores.

867
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,196
After my house chores.

868
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:27,208
- Ladies, thank y'all again.
- You're welcome.

869
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,769
## {Humming}

870
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:35,617
He's humming' again.

871
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:37,743
Yes, I can hear that.

872
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,689
We should put the dishes up.

873
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:48,564
Are you going to help me,
or am I your slave?

874
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:03,708
{Horse Whinnying}

875
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,303
{Pigs Squealing}

876
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:08,076
Go. Go.

877
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:09,651
Get off.

878
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,838
Well...

879
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:38,846
beats sleeping' on the ground.

880
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:43,448
{Clucking, Squawking}

881
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,721
{Chattering}

882
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:02,502
Well, they're a little wilted,
but I hope she likes 'em.

883
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:04,835
All women like flowers, wilted or not.

884
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:07,535
It's the thought behind them that counts.

885
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:09,475
So I'll meet y'all back here then?

886
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:12,980
We're going by the dry goods store
and then a few other places.

887
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:16,540
- Will an hour do you?
- That's plenty enough time. See y'all in an hour.

888
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:20,521
Who do you suppose those flowers are for?

889
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:24,320
I don't know.
Some gal, I guess. He said "she."

890
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:28,121
Ellen.

891
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,098
Are you just curious,
or are you a little jealous?

892
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,828
Jealous? Rue the day.

893
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:36,929
Just curious.

894
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,975
Let's go by the dry goods store
and check on that material.

895
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,873
Then we can go by Millie's.

896
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:45,210
{Woman}
I'm planning it for Tuesday.

897
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:46,543
Thank you.

898
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:48,344
{Bell Jingles}

899
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:52,786
Uh, Ma, you'd best get out here.

900
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:58,422
- {Door Closes}
- {Bell Jingles}

901
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:00,621
Well, you folks can get back to eaten'.

902
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:02,630
Rose, you mind the stove?

903
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:10,002
Uh, these are for you.
Sorry. They're a bit wilted.

904
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:15,367
Nothing' a little fresh water can't fix.

905
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:28,621
You know, I never truly apologized to you.
But I am now.

906
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:32,217
Well, if you feel the need,
then apology accepted.

907
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,361
These are very pretty flowers.

908
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,492
Uh, Cassie... she picked 'em.

909
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:41,695
You and Cassie getting' along all right?

910
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,999
Yes, ma'am. Just fine.

911
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:48,544
Would you like to sit down,
maybe have a piece of pie?

912
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,545
Oh, I... I probably
shouldn't stay too long.

913
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,013
The ladies are waiting' on me.
They're doing' a bit of shopping'.

914
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:55,676
Well, if they're shopping',
it's going to be a while.

915
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:57,252
Come on.

916
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:00,749
Rose, would you bring me
a piece of apple pie?

917
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:02,324
Yes, ma'am.

918
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:06,861
{Clears Throat}
I also brought your payment.

919
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:10,023
You are a young man of principle.

920
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,259
My father.

921
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:15,360
"Be a man of principle and responsibility."

922
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:17,666
In the old days,
I would've told you to forget it.

923
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,643
I lost a lot of money that way.

924
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:24,839
Now I read the good book, and it tells me
to be a cheerful giver and receiver.

925
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:28,678
So, I will cheerfully receive this money...

926
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:30,616
and give you a piece of pie.

927
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,814
- That's very kind of you.
- Oh, not really.

928
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:35,823
I figured this is
the only money you've got...

929
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:38,052
and you probably couldn't
afford to pay for the pie.

930
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:41,586
{Clears Throat}

931
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:45,190
Rosie, would you do me a favour
and go polish the silverware?

932
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,599
Oh, yes, ma'am.

933
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:53,870
Teenage girls.
Full of curiosity and mischief.

934
01:01:57,647 --> 01:01:59,706
{Chattering}

935
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,986
{Clark}
Life can be very confounding, Miss Millie.

936
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:09,716
Something weighing' on you, Clark?

937
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:14,755
It is an ever-changing adventure we are on.

938
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:16,559
Sure is a fact.

939
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:20,397
Be diligent. Give life time.

940
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:23,131
- We never do know what's right around the corner.
- {Bell Jingles}

941
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:26,106
- {Chuckling}
- Well, looked who dropped in.

942
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:28,905
With Clark here, I was wondering
if you two were going to stop by.

943
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:31,605
Well, if I'd known he was coming here,
we would've come with him.

944
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:34,410
He brought me those flowers over there.

945
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:36,747
Kind of an apology gift.

946
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:39,677
Well, isn't that sweet?

947
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:41,780
Rose is in the kitchen.

948
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:44,489
Ellen, come sit.

949
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:47,961
- Yep, and I best be checking' on the team.
- No. Stay. They'll be all right.

950
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:52,296
Well, it's pretty hot outside, so they might
need some water. Thank you for the pie.

951
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,975
Looks like I run him off.

952
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:03,011
He's a very nice young man.

953
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:06,548
Not at all like the ones
who caught that gold fever.

954
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:11,216
- He's responsible.
- It would seem that way.

955
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:15,547
There's a big difference between...

956
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:19,617
just having a crush on somebody
and truly being in love.

957
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,462
I dried out the vegetable seeds
like you said.

958
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:30,835
All I have to do now is go get
some wildflower seeds from the meadow.

959
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:34,137
Be careful in that tall grass.
The rattlers are out this time of year.

960
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:35,710
I will.

961
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:43,115
- The garden is going to be great.
- {Chuckles}

962
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:51,527
She's very excited about the garden.

963
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:53,857
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

964
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:56,591
- You ready to plant soon?
- Yeah.

965
01:03:56,699 --> 01:04:00,760
Just keep turning the soil for a bit, add
some of that dry manure from the milk cow...

966
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,770
water it for a couple days and plant.

967
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:05,841
- You sure know a lot about everything.
- Just basic things.

968
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:08,638
- You read a lot?
- Some.

969
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:10,735
Mostly I learned from my pa.

970
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,042
He tried to teach me
to be a well-rounded man.

971
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:16,607
- You close to him?
- Very. My ma too.

972
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:20,746
You know, we had some problems
when I was growing up, but...

973
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,882
nothing we couldn't get through
without him shooting' me.

974
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:24,619
That would've been awful.

975
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:28,561
Then you wouldn't be here, digging in
the dirt and playing in dry manure.

976
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:33,468
Your pa laugh a lot?

977
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:35,799
- Yeah.
- Mine too.

978
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:37,668
You miss him.

979
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:40,105
I do. Almost every day.

980
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:43,407
Sometimes I think I hear him laugh.

981
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,148
And I turn around,
expecting him to be there.

982
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,378
- Silly, huh?
- No.

983
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:52,716
No, it's not silly.

984
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:56,588
Those are memories.
Memories are what our lives end up being.

985
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:59,388
- Your pa teach you that?
- And he learned it from my ma.

986
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,500
We got to hang on to the good ones...

987
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:07,330
let the bad ones go.

988
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:09,131
Never let 'em haunt us.

989
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:17,702
- Shoot.
- King me.

990
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:21,438
Your move.

991
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:28,350
{Inhales Sharply}

992
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:30,721
I wouldn't move there if I were you.

993
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,333
I know what you're thinking'.

994
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:44,463
Do you?

995
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:47,133
Cassie's forming an attachment.

996
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:52,308
Cassie told Rose that Clark Davis
reminds her of her father.

997
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:55,249
I suspected as much.

998
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:58,120
He'll be leaving soon.

999
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:01,678
Moving on to California,
following his dream.

1000
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,782
He's not like all the rest of 'em.

1001
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:09,958
What? You said so yourself.

1002
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:13,035
Oh. Oh, my.
{Chuckles}

1003
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:17,037
Oh, Millie.
Now don't go jumping' to conclusions.

1004
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,073
You're sweet on him.

1005
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:21,541
No, I'm not sweet on him.

1006
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:24,204
I don't have the time,
nor the inclination...

1007
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,474
for such luxuries.

1008
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:33,253
He's a good man.

1009
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:35,586
Which will make it
all the more difficult when he leaves.

1010
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:38,057
You've got to think about Cassie.

1011
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,561
She never knew her mother.
She lost her father.

1012
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:44,566
How's she going to handle him leaving?

1013
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,507
Have you seen Cassie?

1014
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:02,675
She told me she was going to pick some flowers
and visit your folks.

1015
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:06,016
Oh. Talking' to them gives her peace.

1016
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:08,920
Guess we all could use
an ounce of that from time to time.

1017
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,686
She's become really fond of you.

1018
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:12,920
She's a special young lady.

1019
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:16,298
Your commitment here will be over soon.

1020
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,962
Reckon it will.

1021
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:25,040
You'll be heading' out west to California?

1022
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:28,871
That's been the plan for a long time.

1023
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:31,242
I don't think it'll set well with Cassie.

1024
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:33,872
I don't think it's going to set well
with me either.

1025
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:36,310
And you?

1026
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,081
What about me?

1027
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,290
My ma always told me that a person
who answers a question with a question...

1028
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:50,263
is just avoiding' the first question.

1029
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:54,097
You must be getting' hungry.
I'll go fix your lunch.

1030
01:08:02,778 --> 01:08:04,575
{Grunting}

1031
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:13,016
Do you think the Lord holds a grudge
against Clark for not keeping the Sabbath?

1032
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:15,420
I don't think the Lord holds grudges.

1033
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:18,652
I think that's something
we human beings are inflicted with.

1034
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,772
- Well, how was services?
- They were wonderful.

1035
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:36,208
Millie made bread pudding for the potluck.
It was scrumptious.

1036
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:39,110
She asked about you. Rose did too.

1037
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:42,378
Cassie, go on inside and change
and put some flour on the chicken.

1038
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:44,385
I'll be right in to mash the potatoes.

1039
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:46,817
{Coins Clink}

1040
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:49,552
Payday.

1041
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:00,726
Everything all right?

1042
01:09:00,836 --> 01:09:02,030
Yes.

1043
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,628
Well, thank you.

1044
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,172
- For?
- The money.

1045
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:11,910
You more than earned it.
I wish it could be more.

1046
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:13,982
No, it's fine.

1047
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:17,684
- It's Sunday.
- That it is.

1048
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:21,381
- Will you be joining us for supper?
- Is that an invitation?

1049
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:25,483
Well, remember what your mother said
about answering a question with a question.

1050
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:29,325
{Chuckles}
Yes, I'd love to join you for supper.

1051
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:32,400
Tidy up. I've got chicken to fry.

1052
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:35,061
- I'll unhitch the team for you.
- {Whinnies}

1053
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:46,046
{Cassie} What happened next?

1054
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:49,174
So there were Daniel and I.
We were creeping right behind these grave robbers...

1055
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:51,879
on this road so dark you couldn't even
see your own two feet.

1056
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:55,047
- Were you scared?
- Little bit.

1057
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:58,126
The old boys, they got thirsty.
So they laid that corpse down on the road...

1058
01:09:58,227 --> 01:10:00,593
and they headed off to the creek
to get a quick drink.

1059
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:02,129
And then what happened?

1060
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:04,199
Daniel and I, we grabbed
that old poor dead fella...

1061
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,461
and we flung him in the ditch!

1062
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:09,970
And then Daniel gets
down, just like this...

1063
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:12,404
and he stretches out in
that corpse's place.

1064
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:15,068
- No fooling'?
- No fooling'.

1065
01:10:15,177 --> 01:10:19,045
The old boys came back, they didn't realize
their corpse was a few inches shorter.

1066
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:22,049
And there was Daniel,
lying back, just like this.

1067
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:26,044
What did Daniel say?

1068
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:27,747
He said...

1069
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:31,724
{Loudly}
"Am I getting' heavy, fellas?"

1070
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:35,292
I was a bit rowdy in my younger days.

1071
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:37,695
I bet you were.

1072
01:10:48,143 --> 01:10:50,441
- Hello, Clark.
- Miss Millie.

1073
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:57,611
- Is it that day already?
- Yes, ma'am.

1074
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:02,819
Time just slips by.

1075
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:06,788
Such a precious thing
we can never get back.

1076
01:11:06,895 --> 01:11:10,296
Seems to be going' faster too.
Probably 'cause I been so busy.

1077
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:12,924
Being happy can cause time to fly too.

1078
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:15,903
Yes, ma'am.

1079
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:17,768
So, won't be long.

1080
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:19,898
Won't be an indentured servant anymore.

1081
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:22,500
{Chuckles} Well, I guess I never thought
about it quite like that.

1082
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:26,342
Suppose you'll be heading west,
following your dream?

1083
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,939
I reckon.

1084
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:31,451
I thought about it a lot as of late.

1085
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:33,145

Sheriff.

1091
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:02,481
I got some news for you
on, uh, Daniel Whittaker.

1092
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:04,882
- They hang him?
- Nope.

1093
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,682
Escaped the noose this time.

1094
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:08,484
Got six months on a chain gang.

1095

That's good news.

Could be.

1097
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,351
Or maybe they just
postponed the inevitable.

1098

I'm obliged you told me.

1099

Yep. Good seeing you
at the dance the other night.

- Yes, sir.

- Yes, she did.
- Mm-hmm.

Elbow's acting up.

Big storm brewing'.

- Beautiful day, isn't it?

That it is. None better.

You fixing' shingles?

Probably take a few days
to tighten them all down.

- {Chuckles} I think his elbow is wrong this time.

Apparently so.

Could've held off a few days
so I could get those shingles fixed.

01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:13,626
It's so good to see you.

1246
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:18,525
Cassie, why don't you wait on Ellen.
I'm going to ride back.

1247
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:24,471
{Man} I'll take you all the way
to St. Louis. Yes, ma'am.

1248
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:26,506
Don't you want to see what happens?

1249
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:32,938
That isn’t nothing' I need to see.

1250
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:41,882
Hey, is Millie still in business?

1251
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:43,389
Um...

1252
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:48,489
Yes.

1253
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:50,496
Okay. Well, let's go there,
have something to eat.

1254
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:52,190
We can catch up on lost time.

1255
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,063
All right.

1256
01:22:54,169 --> 01:22:56,137
We can catch up on things.

1257
01:23:00,108 --> 01:23:02,633
- {Man} You need some help?
- {Man #2} No, we're good.

1258
01:23:02,744 --> 01:23:03,904
{Man #1} All right.

1259
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:06,242
{Jake Chuckles}

1260
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:08,748
I hit the big one.

1261
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:11,216
Enough gold to buy a small country.

1262
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:15,653
Bought a big, beautiful house
in San Francisco, up on a hill.

1263
01:23:16,858 --> 01:23:19,986
You can watch the Pacific Ocean all day.

1264
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:22,996
I'm real happy for you, Jake.

1265
01:23:23,098 --> 01:23:25,191
Oh, you're going to love it there.

1266
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:30,059
I... can't imagine living' in San Francisco.

1267
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:32,196
{Jake Chuckles}

1268
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:35,208
Well, neither could I, but...

1269
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:36,777
look at me.

1270
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:40,575
You seem very happy and sure of yourself.

1271
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:43,310
Yeah, well, now I'm back, Ellie.

1272
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:46,046
A rich man, just like I promised.

1273
01:23:46,154 --> 01:23:49,749
And I'm sitting' across a table from you...
{Sighs}

1274
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:51,758
Asking you to marry me.

1275
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:54,021
Are you proposing'?

1276
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:55,596
{Chuckles}

1277
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:57,062
Yes.

1278
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:00,233
Yes, I am, Ellen Barlow.

1279
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,097
Will you marry me?

1280
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:37,567
Clark?

1281
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,974
I'm so sorry.

1282
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:42,737
Me too.

1283
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:45,980
I'm going to go back up to the hill camp.

1284
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:48,242
I'll finish my commitment up there.

1285
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:54,681
I know you must be feeling
confused and hurt.

1286
01:24:54,789 --> 01:24:57,849
Could be. I'll be all right.

1287
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:06,991
Millie once told me there's a difference
between a crush and true love.

1288
01:25:08,036 --> 01:25:09,936
And I understand now what she meant.

1289
01:25:11,372 --> 01:25:15,138
You told me about
bad memories that can haunt.

1290
01:25:17,412 --> 01:25:19,710
There's only room in my life for one man.

1291
01:25:21,249 --> 01:25:23,513
And he's the man I want to marry.

1292
01:25:24,752 --> 01:25:26,652
And that man is Clark Davis.

1293
01:25:38,433 --> 01:25:40,230
Are you sure?

1294
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:44,237
I've never been more sure
about anything in my entire life.

1295
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:53,744
Nothing' I thought I wanted matters anymore.

1296
01:25:57,585 --> 01:25:59,052
Only you.

1297
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:03,056
Will you marry me?

1298
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:17,130
<i>{Man}
I now pronounce you man and wife.</i>

1299
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:21,204
Son, you may kiss your bride.

1300
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:23,470
- {Woman} Aw.
- {Crowd Murmuring}

1301
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:37,589
<i>{Ellen Narrating} Clark Davis
never did make it to California.</i>

1302
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:39,683
<i>He never made his fortune in gold...</i>

1303
01:26:39,794 --> 01:26:42,058
<i>nor saw the Great Wall of China.</i>

1304
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:45,860
<i>Instead he found his way
to the Barlow Farm...</i>

1305
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:48,936
<i>and into our lives and hearts.</i>

1306
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:52,939
<i>"For where your treasure is,
there will your heart be also. "</i>
