1
00:03:54,543 --> 00:03:58,078
All Chinese but Wu stay put!

2
00:04:00,215 --> 00:04:03,750
Wu! Wait a minute, Wu!
I will fucking drop you!

3
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:06,045
Wu, get with me here!

4
00:04:06,638 --> 00:04:08,796
...exactly because of this bullshit!

5
00:04:10,225 --> 00:04:13,808
...or I'll blow your tall Chinese head off!
Hey, Davey, open the door!

6
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:18,476
Thank you.

7
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:46,255
Wu's reappeared, Mr Tolliver.

8
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:49,002
His and Lee's Chinks went at it.

9
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:51,255
Looks like one dead apiece.

10
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:55,096
Where's the fuck did Wu reappear?

11
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:58,395
It seems to me like
he just fucking materialised.

12
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,647
From the clouds,
or in some type of conveyance?

13
00:05:01,859 --> 00:05:03,935
Make me choose, I'll pick the clouds.

14
00:05:04,027 --> 00:05:07,895
One minute, he ain't by his sty.
Next glance, there he is.

15
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,109
Then one man's dead by axe.
Lee's man.

16
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,857
One by bullet.

17
00:05:12,953 --> 00:05:14,744
- Wu's.
- From Lee's pistol.

18
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,329
Then Wu and Lee are coming
after each other like stags...

19
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:21,583
until Burns drags Wu into the Gem.

20
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,294
Drags Wu into the Gem?

21
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,630
Burns does, yes, sir,
pointing his pistol at Lee.

22
00:05:27,592 --> 00:05:30,546
Could Wu have issued from the Gem,
as well?

23
00:05:30,637 --> 00:05:32,713
I wouldn't say he didn't.

24
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,018
Larson, that I got the dollar in with...

25
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:42,472
says he just brought George Hearst
to the camp, sir.

26
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:47,777
Some as don't know better...

27
00:05:47,862 --> 00:05:50,816
might mistake me
for being on the outside looking in.

28
00:05:50,907 --> 00:05:53,113
Then you got your idle snatch
reading scripture...

29
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,442
and know there's still hope.

30
00:05:56,912 --> 00:05:59,320
- Con Stapleton.
- Yes, sir?

31
00:05:59,749 --> 00:06:01,540
Situate yourself at the Grand Central...

32
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:05,077
and tell me what fucking Wolcott's
doing and who he's doing it with.

33
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,795
Yes, sir, Mr T.

34
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:10,046
Can the bison spare you?

35
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:15,503
Something strikes me
fucking melancholy about that creature.

36
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:19,050
One more fucking day!

37
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:22,093
That's all he had to control himself...

38
00:06:22,187 --> 00:06:25,603
and I could have put him
in fucking business.

39
00:06:25,982 --> 00:06:28,818
- Swearengen...
- Shut the fuck up, Wu!

40
00:06:28,902 --> 00:06:30,978
At least he has an excuse.
He's a Chink.

41
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:33,478
Who knows
what the tribal requirements are.

42
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:36,111
Maybe you don't act for a week...

43
00:06:36,284 --> 00:06:40,068
maybe they exclude you
from fucking dominoes or the like.

44
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:41,443
But you!

45
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,782
Tipping our fucking business.

46
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:46,251
I'm sorry, Al.

47
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:49,539
You hold one Chink off at gunpoint,
bring him the fuck up here.

48
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:50,710
I'm sorry.

49
00:06:50,798 --> 00:06:55,010
I'm so fucking pleased I trusted you,
Johnny, to go out and buy meat.

50
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:57,384
Get out of my fucking way!

51
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:00,803
Tell Hearst I want to see him.

52
00:07:01,183 --> 00:07:05,098
My only reluctance, Al,
I have had such an onset of diarrhoea.

53
00:07:10,025 --> 00:07:14,355
- E.B.
- Lf the conversation's brief...

54
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,068
I'm absolutely equal to the task.

55
00:07:18,325 --> 00:07:20,947
What shall I invoke as your reason?

56
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:23,076
How about the fucking truth?

57
00:07:23,163 --> 00:07:27,825
The Chink that attacked his Chink
has been captured by my employee.

58
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:30,409
If it would please Mr Hearst,
I'd like a word with him...

59
00:07:30,504 --> 00:07:32,959
before I decide what to do
with the Chink in my custody.

60
00:07:33,048 --> 00:07:34,163
But you'd like it here?

61
00:07:34,257 --> 00:07:36,250
Don't you be setting fucking terms, E.B.

62
00:07:36,343 --> 00:07:39,130
He's got reason enough
to want the look around.

63
00:07:39,221 --> 00:07:40,596
Fine, then.

64
00:07:42,474 --> 00:07:45,143
Go lock him up
somewhere in the whores' quarters.

65
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:47,266
You might think to put
a fucking guard on him...

66
00:07:47,354 --> 00:07:50,557
that ain't asleep,
you incompetent fucks.

67
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:58,359
- It wasn't my watch he escaped on, Al.
- Go away, Johnny.

68
00:07:59,365 --> 00:08:01,192
I was 10:00 to 4:00.

69
00:08:01,326 --> 00:08:03,863
Shut the fucking door!

70
00:08:12,712 --> 00:08:14,503
Would you still be willing, Mr Bullock...

71
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:17,293
to see me take up the teaching
of the camp's children?

72
00:08:17,383 --> 00:08:19,790
I would, yes. I'd be delighted.

73
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:25,473
Delighted.

74
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,474
I don't want to lose him,
but I wouldn't upset them, either.

75
00:08:34,358 --> 00:08:35,556
I see.

76
00:08:36,235 --> 00:08:39,235
They're daunted enough
by schooling itself.

77
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:40,810
Oh, yes.

78
00:08:44,284 --> 00:08:47,985
I am speaking of wearing mourning
until the year has passed.

79
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,782
But I believe...

80
00:08:52,876 --> 00:08:56,660
if I teach them with love and joy...

81
00:08:57,589 --> 00:08:59,961
then I won't make them afraid.

82
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:06,175
And I don't want to lose him.

83
00:09:07,724 --> 00:09:09,681
You'll never lose him.

84
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:27,650
Are we done with our buying, Francis?

85
00:09:27,743 --> 00:09:29,866
All but one of the important finds.

86
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:33,488
I have 40 stamps and a millwright
coming in from the Ophir.

87
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:36,666
I have the mill sited,
the ground tiled and levelled.

88
00:09:36,752 --> 00:09:40,168
The Garret find we don't yet own
is not placed to obstruct operations.

89
00:09:40,255 --> 00:09:41,798
I want it bought.

90
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:44,551
I believe its title will be contested
in coming months.

91
00:09:44,635 --> 00:09:46,758
To act now would buy the contest
and not the find.

92
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:49,680
All this fiddle fucking around
is tactical back-and-forth.

93
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:51,342
We're up and running, Mr Hearst.

94
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:55,051
With the millwright and double shifts,
we should be full bore inside the week.

95
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:58,478
Getting it out of the ground,
that's what I love.

96
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:03,105
Thank you for handling
the acquisitions, Francis.

97
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:06,854
Excuse me, Mr Hearst.

98
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:11,694
Might I escort you...

99
00:10:11,786 --> 00:10:15,866
across the thoroughfare
to meet a local luminary?

100
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,325
Will you be joining me
at the operation this morning?

101
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,126
No. I may this afternoon.

102
00:10:20,211 --> 00:10:22,334
This morning I'm conceding to my back.

103
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:31,301
Fellow looks like
he stepped out of a specimen box.

104
00:10:33,307 --> 00:10:37,768
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Forgive me for interrupting your repast.

105
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:41,223
I'm E.B. Farnum, mayor and hotelier.

106
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:44,724
And I know you are George Hearst.

107
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,733
Yes?

108
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,067
Allow me a moment's silence,
Mr Hearst.

109
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:55,150
Sir, I am having a digestive crisis...

110
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:58,538
and must focus on
suppressing its expression.

111
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:03,705
What's next?
Pink fucking panties or something?

112
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:07,709
Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!
I can't fucking do it.

113
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,756
And I'll have a look
at one of those pans.

114
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:12,713
Not now.
Tomorrow, I'll make you a price.

115
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:15,758
This is the prospective groom
for today's prospective wedding...

116
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:18,470
and I'm going to wait on him now
in privacy.

117
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:24,433
Oh...

118
00:11:24,524 --> 00:11:28,984
Surprised you have any trade left,
often as I clear the joint.

119
00:11:31,364 --> 00:11:33,107
What can't you do?

120
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:35,317
Any of it! It feels like.

121
00:11:35,743 --> 00:11:39,242
These fucking mittens in particular.

122
00:11:40,957 --> 00:11:43,957
"Traditional," the fucking tailor says.

123
00:11:44,043 --> 00:11:46,498
Well, not in my experience, they ain't.

124
00:11:46,587 --> 00:11:48,995
And if I was to imagine
where they might be...

125
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:52,838
amongst males about to marry
ain't what comes to my mind.

126
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:55,216
Look at these cocksuckers!

127
00:11:55,304 --> 00:11:56,679
Lavender.

128
00:11:57,181 --> 00:12:01,474
"The rigour in New York City,"
whatever the fuck that means.

129
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,133
Have you brought up not wearing them?

130
00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:06,471
What if they're her idea?

131
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:09,982
That's liable to bring the dromedary
to its knees.

132
00:12:11,737 --> 00:12:14,228
Christ! I'm in mortal misery.

133
00:12:14,322 --> 00:12:18,901
Anyways, today's the day.

134
00:12:28,086 --> 00:12:30,328
Going to the wedding, Davey?

135
00:12:30,964 --> 00:12:33,455
Not hardly, Mr Swearengen.
Wasn't invited.

136
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,626
I was, not that I'm going.

137
00:12:35,718 --> 00:12:39,467
Vicious rumours I was responsible
for her first husband's death.

138
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:42,225
Fucking woman invites me
to her wedding.

139
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:45,095
Guess it's no accounting
for why people do things.

140
00:12:45,186 --> 00:12:49,100
Congregation says amen, Davey.

141
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:52,605
- Consider the Chinaman.
- Wu?

142
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:57,153
Forsakes safety and even odds
in a future fight...

143
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:59,528
for immediate fucking dubious combat.

144
00:12:59,617 --> 00:13:03,828
Here again,
what gets into people's heads?

145
00:13:04,496 --> 00:13:06,655
The congregation says amen.

146
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,074
- What?
- Nothing. I was being funny.

147
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:13,419
No, no, no.
Don't be fucking funny with me, Davey.

148
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,009
I didn't mean to interrupt
your train of thought.

149
00:13:17,551 --> 00:13:19,590
- What?
- Nothing, sir.

150
00:13:23,014 --> 00:13:27,094
Did you loose that Chinaman
to fuck up my fucking plans?

151
00:13:28,812 --> 00:13:29,974
Don't lie to me, Davey...

152
00:13:30,063 --> 00:13:32,684
or that breath you're holding
is the last you draw.

153
00:13:32,774 --> 00:13:35,063
- Can I speak?
- Go ahead.

154
00:13:35,151 --> 00:13:36,943
I need to breathe.

155
00:13:38,488 --> 00:13:40,279
Go take a breath.

156
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:43,777
I fucking fell asleep, sir, on my
fucking watch over the Chinaman.

157
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:45,446
He didn't pay you to let him go?

158
00:13:45,536 --> 00:13:47,695
No, I fell off to sleep
from the holding of the three jobs.

159
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:51,122
- He told me he paid you.
- Then he's a lying fucking bastard!

160
00:13:58,674 --> 00:14:01,509
- Don't fall asleep, Davey.
- No, sir.

161
00:14:01,594 --> 00:14:05,971
- Quit a job before you fall asleep on it.
- Yes, sir.

162
00:14:06,307 --> 00:14:10,055
- There he is. That's Mr Swearengen.
- Yes, I see.

163
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:12,432
Now I call this
the impressive contingent.

164
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:14,597
- Would you be Mr Hearst?
- Yes, sir.

165
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:18,023
- AI Swearengen. How do you do?
- Pleasure to meet you, Mr Swearengen.

166
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,945
I'll suggest we adjourn to my quarters.

167
00:14:22,406 --> 00:14:24,529
- Your kill, sir?
- Who?

168
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:26,367
The animal.

169
00:14:26,451 --> 00:14:29,701
Oh, no. Fuck, no.
I'm a fucking terrible shot.

170
00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:32,071
Work better closer in.

171
00:14:34,543 --> 00:14:38,208
I'll stay below, gentlemen,
unless you wish me up above.

172
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,546
- Hurt back?
- Just a little achy today.

173
00:14:42,926 --> 00:14:45,927
Declining years spare us
no fucking indignities.

174
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:49,677
My latest blessing's a horse apple
up my fucking asshole.

175
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:52,257
Half my waking hours are spent
trying to pass water.

176
00:14:52,352 --> 00:14:56,895
Dan, bring that Celestial to my office.
I want to show him to Mr Hearst.

177
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:03,984
Very auspicious beginning.

178
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,944
I'd think
with these balcony doors open...

179
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:11,822
you'd get a little cross draught
in the summer.

180
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,027
I do, indeed.

181
00:15:13,122 --> 00:15:15,660
I've spent the last summers in Mexico.

182
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,707
That fucking heat must be oppressive.

183
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:20,996
- Nevada's was drier, I'd expect.
- Have you been there?

184
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:25,133
My inferno was Australia.
Waste of two years, that was.

185
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,420
Yeah, come in.

186
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:32,048
Here we are. This yellow monkey's Wu.

187
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,141
Older fella.
Not often you can tell how old they are.

188
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:37,765
Done a turn or two for me, Wu has.

189
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,262
And well liked enough among his own.

190
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,812
His display against your Chink...

191
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:45,522
was my first fucking inkling
that he's irrational.

192
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:49,526
Mr Lee, the man he tried to kill, has
worked well for me in several camps.

193
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,941
Then God bless Lee,
and off with fucking Wu's head.

194
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:55,783
You've got your finger on the cause of it,
too, your Chink being forward-looking.

195
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,030
"Set the bodies ablaze,
on with the day's trade."

196
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,793
- This one, being longer in the tooth...
- Set what bodies ablaze?

197
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,119
Custom holds stronger
than what passes for his mind.

198
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,463
- What bodies, Mr Swearengen?
- The whores for your workers.

199
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:10,629
Not only does burning the corpses
save cargo space...

200
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,923
far as the transporting of their bones
back to the homeland...

201
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:18,178
which, as I gather, they hold as their
big fucking chance at the afterlife.

202
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,435
What a tremendous tactic,
terrifying the unburned here.

203
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,515
Do you know prospecting,
Mr Swearengen?

204
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,267
Fucking nothing of it.

205
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,601
And the securing of the colour,
once found?

206
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,814
- Not a fucking thing.
- All I really care about.

207
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,195
I fucking hope so.
I'd hate to think you're this good...

208
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,276
at something that's only
a fucking hobby.

209
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:39,117
Most often, my finds are in wild places,
which I prefer.

210
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,072
When that is not so...

211
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:45,204
I want friendly relations
with my predecessors...

212
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:49,791
so that I can
secure the colour undistracted.

213
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:53,468
Concentration, see?

214
00:16:53,553 --> 00:16:56,720
I suspect that's a key
with you hugely successful types.

215
00:16:56,806 --> 00:17:01,682
If others can provide here,
with less disruption to the camp...

216
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,765
services Lee provided me elsewhere,
I'd have no objection to using them.

217
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,150
Labour being the fucking essential?

218
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:12,145
Towards securing the colour.

219
00:17:12,238 --> 00:17:15,856
This is the camp's original Chink.
All subsequent Chinks were his imports.

220
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,777
Wu will staff your mines.

221
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:21,569
And those that survive the explosions,
he can place in laundries or kitchens.

222
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:24,914
- Can he understand us?
- Oh, very little English.

223
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:28,626
No. No words we've employed so far.
Say "cocksucker," Wu.

224
00:17:28,713 --> 00:17:30,171
Cocksucker.

225
00:17:30,506 --> 00:17:33,756
That, San Francisco and Swearengen,
that's all I've heard him use.

226
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:35,088
- Swearengen...
- Shut up.

227
00:17:35,177 --> 00:17:37,086
Now, as to your man and mine...

228
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:41,640
I would need some demonstration
before making my final choice.

229
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:43,848
So your man would have to prove out.

230
00:17:43,936 --> 00:17:47,305
That's a fucking mining term. Now,
that's a fucking expression I've heard.

231
00:17:47,397 --> 00:17:50,268
And you understand
its import and context?

232
00:17:50,984 --> 00:17:52,360
Yes, sir.

233
00:17:52,444 --> 00:17:54,733
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr Swearengen.

234
00:17:54,821 --> 00:17:57,526
Honour and a pleasure meeting you,
Mr Hearst.

235
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:09,284
Kill a rooster, Wu,
and offer him up in sacrifice.

236
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:14,045
Then start honing your weapons
for tonight's demonstration.

237
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,342
Stick me one more fucking time, Jewel,
I'll drop you in a pool of fucking blood.

238
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:21,967
Well, you just can't stand still.

239
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:25,468
I'm moving
trying to defend my fucking self.

240
00:18:30,565 --> 00:18:33,316
He's getting what he asked for, anyway.

241
00:18:36,696 --> 00:18:38,439
Loony fucking Jew.

242
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,360
Wear this.

243
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:47,737
Devious fucking cripple, you are.

244
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:54,576
How'd you pay that time then,
for the gun I sent you to buy?

245
00:18:55,589 --> 00:18:57,546
Sold a piece of pussy.

246
00:19:04,556 --> 00:19:09,017
How may I serve you further, Mr Hearst,
be the fashion great or mean?

247
00:19:09,102 --> 00:19:13,016
Make a price on your hotel.
Mr Wolcott says you avoid it.

248
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:17,898
May I quibble with "avoid," sir,
as inexactly fitting the case?

249
00:19:19,988 --> 00:19:21,980
Not all... Get over!

250
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:28,319
Not all not-makings-of-a-price are
avoidances necessarily, would you say?

251
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:30,865
What will you take?

252
00:19:31,207 --> 00:19:33,579
Get away from me, God damn you!

253
00:19:36,462 --> 00:19:37,660
Forgive me.

254
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,413
Excuse me. I am mad.

255
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,093
My hotel is also my hospital.
I am my own warden.

256
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:51,472
I mustn't sell, lest I then wander the
thoroughfare gibbering like a simian...

257
00:19:52,812 --> 00:19:55,385
brandishing my privates in my fist.

258
00:19:57,024 --> 00:20:00,689
Will you take $100,000
if I let you stay on as manager?

259
00:20:00,861 --> 00:20:03,233
Yes, sir. I must, of course.

260
00:20:03,864 --> 00:20:07,149
- I'll have it sent over later.
- Well, where am I?

261
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:11,363
Why am I on my ass?

262
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,874
May I say to you
that the week since our meeting...

263
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,958
has seen me conduct with Yankton
an active telegraphic correspondence...

264
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:24,962
which on every count has ameliorated
the terms of the proposal before you...

265
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:26,629
in favour of the Deadwood camp?

266
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,712
You smell like cat piss.

267
00:20:28,805 --> 00:20:33,301
I have worked so hard and diligently
for you, Mr Swearengen...

268
00:20:33,393 --> 00:20:35,053
that well may be the case.

269
00:20:35,145 --> 00:20:38,893
Regardless of the outcome,
I am proud of that advocacy.

270
00:20:39,065 --> 00:20:41,473
You having said that,
you liable to say more?

271
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:44,319
Let the document now speak for itself.

272
00:20:44,862 --> 00:20:48,196
The letters may get larger,
the numbers will not.

273
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:53,322
Forgive me.

274
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:57,114
Long hours,
giddy at the smell of the barn.

275
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:00,250
Stoic composure.

276
00:21:03,964 --> 00:21:06,290
The next sound you hear
will be that of your own voice.

277
00:21:06,383 --> 00:21:09,337
Get the fuck out of here. You'll know
when I've come to an answer.

278
00:21:09,428 --> 00:21:12,879
I must tell you
I require a response within the hour.

279
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,508
Or as soon as humanly possible.

280
00:21:25,402 --> 00:21:28,438
Clam on a half shell
looking goddamned fool!

281
00:21:29,364 --> 00:21:32,069
I'm embarrassed to say I know you!

282
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,026
Supposed intelligent woman
holding with rank superstition.

283
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:39,739
The same clothes worn to nuptials
the week of a memorial...

284
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,371
curse bride and groom forever.

285
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:45,706
Shut up, Mose!

286
00:21:45,797 --> 00:21:47,789
He asked for work here.

287
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:51,050
- As what?
- Watchman is what he suggested.

288
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:54,465
We're a vacant structure,
in case he ain't fucking noticed.

289
00:21:54,555 --> 00:21:57,011
I think he shrinks from leaving.

290
00:21:57,767 --> 00:22:00,472
And the word for that is "malingering."

291
00:22:01,562 --> 00:22:02,760
Here.

292
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,848
- I will not.
- You will.

293
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:11,394
- Is that part of the superstition?
- Undergarments? Yes.

294
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:16,075
Over privates, in layers,
or bride and groom are doomed.

295
00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:21,449
Hearst is at that claim...

296
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,494
mid-thoroughfare, the one you bought
from Marvin Somes.

297
00:22:24,585 --> 00:22:27,254
- Still in the company of Farnum?
- No, sir.

298
00:22:28,172 --> 00:22:32,252
They left the Gem, conversed a bit,
Farnum fell over backwards.

299
00:22:32,342 --> 00:22:36,755
Hearst then helped him back to his feet,
then the two parted company.

300
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:40,472
That makes a lot of fucking sense, Con.
Well done.

301
00:22:42,435 --> 00:22:45,306
Farnum then returned to his hotel.

302
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,685
They're readying for them nuptials.

303
00:22:47,774 --> 00:22:50,728
You know,
Ellsworth and the widow Garret's!

304
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:56,572
Guess that's the last Ellsworth
will be seeing of a placer cradle.

305
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,619
Set for life!

306
00:23:08,753 --> 00:23:09,951
Yeah.

307
00:23:11,255 --> 00:23:14,007
- Davey said you wanted to see me.
- Get in here.

308
00:23:14,342 --> 00:23:17,129
And help me parse Yankton's proposal.

309
00:23:17,511 --> 00:23:22,054
We study for our fucking lives.

310
00:23:31,817 --> 00:23:35,980
Three hours in camp,
going straight to exploring her vitals.

311
00:23:36,113 --> 00:23:38,651
Cy Tolliver, Mr Hearst,
that's acted for your interests...

312
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,029
at one or several removes
these last couple of months.

313
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:44,035
How do you do?
Did you buy me this hole?

314
00:23:44,496 --> 00:23:46,904
Off Marvin Somes, sir, yes, I did.

315
00:23:46,998 --> 00:23:49,869
She's out of colour, boys.
Let's fill her in.

316
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,367
I was told to act on all offers.

317
00:23:52,462 --> 00:23:56,163
You did well, Mr Tolliver.
We want to be comprehensive.

318
00:23:59,594 --> 00:24:04,505
I been in the mud a bit for you myself,
Mr Hearst.

319
00:24:05,391 --> 00:24:08,725
Got my shovel out covering work of
your Mr Wolcott.

320
00:24:08,811 --> 00:24:10,603
Thank you for that.

321
00:24:10,855 --> 00:24:14,438
Scooped and scrubbed
and cleaned up the guts and gore...

322
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:17,811
'cause I do what the business requires.

323
00:24:19,614 --> 00:24:21,156
There's my hotel.

324
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:25,152
The camp elders called a meeting
in the aftermath.

325
00:24:25,786 --> 00:24:29,321
Barely time to wash my hands
before I talked them into washing theirs.

326
00:24:29,415 --> 00:24:31,704
I have been travelling, sir.

327
00:24:32,293 --> 00:24:35,578
Why don't we resume after I've rested?

328
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,380
Well, I guess I can manage
a while longer...

329
00:24:39,466 --> 00:24:41,755
to keep the whiff off of him.

330
00:24:42,469 --> 00:24:45,838
Suspicion, Mr Hearst,
off your geologist, Wolcott...

331
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:48,220
for cutting three whores' throats.

332
00:25:08,703 --> 00:25:10,826
Oh, cocksucker!

333
00:25:19,464 --> 00:25:21,919
I don't know why I seek you out.

334
00:25:23,676 --> 00:25:27,674
If lying in the ground
you can think or have feelings...

335
00:25:28,306 --> 00:25:30,678
you may hate me
and my part in your fate...

336
00:25:30,766 --> 00:25:33,851
as I sometimes hate you
for bringing me here.

337
00:25:38,983 --> 00:25:41,770
Though I know your bringing me
was the end of something...

338
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:45,692
whose beginning I had
as much a part of, certainly, as you.

339
00:25:49,743 --> 00:25:51,202
I am afraid.

340
00:25:53,455 --> 00:25:57,239
I am so afraid that my life is living me...

341
00:25:57,334 --> 00:26:01,711
and soon will be over, and not
a moment of it will have been my own.

342
00:26:01,963 --> 00:26:05,878
And of how my body now tells me
that is fine and right.

343
00:26:07,761 --> 00:26:11,461
Perhaps I confide to you
because you cannot tell anyone.

344
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:24,562
I am to have a child,
and I have a child in my care.

345
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:35,786
He is a good man.

346
00:26:40,835 --> 00:26:43,539
And he whom I love is here as well.

347
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:52,633
These walls are coming down.

348
00:26:53,055 --> 00:26:54,514
They'll be your walls soon.

349
00:26:54,598 --> 00:26:58,014
Ever since I was a child in Missouri,
I've been down every hole I could find.

350
00:26:58,102 --> 00:26:59,477
Boy-The-Earth-Talks-To.

351
00:26:59,561 --> 00:27:01,435
Yeah, I've told you
that's what the Indians call me.

352
00:27:01,522 --> 00:27:02,636
Yes.

353
00:27:03,106 --> 00:27:05,858
It talks to you, too, Francis. I know.

354
00:27:06,193 --> 00:27:09,443
In our time together,
your hearing has stayed keen.

355
00:27:10,072 --> 00:27:11,815
But this gambler, Tolliver...

356
00:27:11,907 --> 00:27:15,276
who was our agent
for securing the claims...

357
00:27:15,786 --> 00:27:17,577
has spoken to me about you.

358
00:27:18,747 --> 00:27:22,412
He says that you killed women.
Prostitutes.

359
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:27,083
That he has disposed
of the bodies for you.

360
00:27:29,966 --> 00:27:31,377
Well?

361
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:40,267
When I was in Campeche,
you wrote a letter on my behalf.

362
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:43,470
To the Jefe de Policía.

363
00:27:45,189 --> 00:27:50,231
"I am aware of Mr Wolcott's difficulty.
You will find me personally grateful...

364
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,320
"for any adjustments you may make
in his case."

365
00:27:57,243 --> 00:27:59,069
What did you think that was about?

366
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:02,660
I didn't think about it.
You were my agent in Mexico.

367
00:28:03,374 --> 00:28:04,702
You had many responsibilities.

368
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:06,583
You asked me for the letter,
and I wrote it.

369
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:09,835
As when the earth talks to you,
particularly, you never ask its reasons?

370
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:12,210
I don't need to know why I'm lucky.

371
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:18,637
What if the earth talks to us
to get us to arrange its amusements?

372
00:28:18,722 --> 00:28:21,474
That sounds like goddamn nonsense
to me.

373
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:24,927
Suppose to you it whispers...

374
00:28:26,062 --> 00:28:29,016
"You are king over me.
I exist to flesh your will."

375
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,435
Nonsense.

376
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:35,021
And to me, "There is no sin."

377
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:44,035
It happened in Mexico,
and now it's happened here.

378
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:01,794
We must end our connection,
you understand that, Francis?

379
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:06,550
Make a severance you think fair.
You know I won't quibble.

380
00:29:08,562 --> 00:29:12,891
Does some spirit overtake you?
Is that what you mean by the talk?

381
00:29:16,028 --> 00:29:17,107
No.

382
00:29:19,948 --> 00:29:23,649
It tells me where the colour is.
That's all it tells me.

383
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,408
My God.

384
00:29:32,794 --> 00:29:36,459
This has to be a date certain.
"Timely fashion" means fucking nothing.

385
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:40,753
"Timely fashion" means
when they got the fix in.

386
00:29:41,594 --> 00:29:43,338
So when do you want the elections?

387
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:46,134
- The sooner the fucking better.
- Six weeks?

388
00:29:48,143 --> 00:29:49,471
No more.

389
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:51,347
Far as bringing ringers in...

390
00:29:51,437 --> 00:29:55,056
"period of residence" would be
a nice shiv to stick in their fucking ribs.

391
00:29:55,149 --> 00:29:57,640
And now you're using
your fucking noodle.

392
00:29:58,152 --> 00:30:00,524
How do we put that into words?

393
00:30:01,531 --> 00:30:03,404
"Period of residence."

394
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:06,942
- Are you being smart with me?
- How would you put it?

395
00:30:07,912 --> 00:30:11,328
Period of residence not less than what?

396
00:30:12,124 --> 00:30:13,500
Two weeks.

397
00:30:14,168 --> 00:30:16,741
No one is eligible to vote...

398
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,622
unless they've been two weeks
in the camp.

399
00:30:19,715 --> 00:30:21,672
Unless committed to dump
in our favour.

400
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:24,166
I'd like to get this fucking thing done.

401
00:30:24,261 --> 00:30:26,337
"...has not been...

402
00:30:27,723 --> 00:30:30,261
"two weeks in camp."

403
00:30:36,273 --> 00:30:39,938
Now I'll tell you what the fuck else.
And it makes me weep to say it.

404
00:30:40,027 --> 00:30:42,944
Take out the fucking 50.
From Yankton to us.

405
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:45,105
Shall I urge you to reconsider?

406
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:47,239
We get this thing off the ground...

407
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:51,026
I will be without peer of
robbing these cocksuckers senseless.

408
00:30:51,121 --> 00:30:55,118
I don't want the founding document
recording a fucking bribe.

409
00:30:57,168 --> 00:31:02,126
Strike Number 4 from the original,
with disgust it was even brought up.

410
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,790
What else?

411
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:14,055
Summon that cat-piss-smelling
fuckhead and His Holiness the Sheriff.

412
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:24,646
Commissioner! Shall we chat?

413
00:31:34,788 --> 00:31:37,279
Ain't you two a fucking picture?

414
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:41,783
Trixie, you save me a trip.

415
00:31:43,881 --> 00:31:45,672
You should've let it
hit her in the schnoz.

416
00:31:45,757 --> 00:31:48,295
Remind her of escorts in days past.

417
00:31:48,385 --> 00:31:51,006
That's a gift for the bride...

418
00:31:51,096 --> 00:31:54,097
from her child's former tutor in absentia.

419
00:31:54,182 --> 00:31:58,678
Whirling her around is okay, Star.
Just don't tread on her fucking toes.

420
00:32:01,106 --> 00:32:04,190
Adams?
You saw Yankton's hypocrite, huh?

421
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:07,818
Just His Holiness.
Then we'll have a quorum.

422
00:32:24,754 --> 00:32:28,170
Go ahead and take that to him, Captain.
Thank you.

423
00:32:52,573 --> 00:32:53,948
Bless you.

424
00:33:00,122 --> 00:33:03,989
Bless you. Bless you. Bless you.

425
00:33:04,835 --> 00:33:07,408
I'm in the day's fucking talents, Tom.

426
00:33:07,504 --> 00:33:10,291
There's talk of an offer on my place.

427
00:33:11,466 --> 00:33:15,594
- How will you answer?
- I came to take counsel with you.

428
00:33:15,678 --> 00:33:18,348
Drunk or sober, is my question.

429
00:33:18,515 --> 00:33:20,472
Well, I have my wits about me, Al.

430
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:21,839
Maybe, then.

431
00:33:22,477 --> 00:33:25,098
You'll want a few more, huh?

432
00:33:25,188 --> 00:33:27,857
Don't talk to me in fucking riddles.

433
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:32,104
Drunk, Tom, for reasons
not to do with business, you'll sell.

434
00:33:32,612 --> 00:33:34,984
If that's your decision, let me offer.

435
00:33:35,072 --> 00:33:38,406
Sober, you know selling's stupid.

436
00:33:38,534 --> 00:33:41,618
What's my reason
not to do with business?

437
00:33:41,704 --> 00:33:43,743
Use your own fucking faculties.

438
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,658
Remorse.

439
00:33:49,753 --> 00:33:52,920
Over that boy
that was not your fucking fault.

440
00:33:55,175 --> 00:33:56,420
Again?

441
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,048
Not right now.

442
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:06,851
Ellsworth and the widow Garret.

443
00:34:08,105 --> 00:34:10,856
What odds would you have made
on that?

444
00:34:11,525 --> 00:34:13,897
Every so often there's a love match.

445
00:34:39,051 --> 00:34:41,721
Isn't it time to start the ceremony?

446
00:34:59,613 --> 00:35:01,985
And now, my dear lady...

447
00:35:02,825 --> 00:35:06,407
shall I part thou leather lips?

448
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:44,444
It's the damn underwear.

449
00:35:45,992 --> 00:35:50,404
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered
together here in the sight of God...

450
00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:52,489
"and in the face of this company...

451
00:35:52,582 --> 00:35:57,042

454

keep thee only unto her...

466
00:36:51,681 --> 00:36:54,088
"as long as ye both shall live?"

467
00:36:54,225 --> 00:36:55,423
I will.

468
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,684
"Alma Russell Garret...

469
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,973
"wilt thou have this man
to thy wedded husband...

470
00:37:01,065 --> 00:37:05,145
"to live together after God's ordinance
in the holy estate of matrimony?"

471
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:06,350
I will.

472
00:37:06,612 --> 00:37:07,727
Continuing.

473
00:37:07,822 --> 00:37:10,360
"Wilt thou obey him and serve him...

474
00:37:10,449 --> 00:37:13,616
"love, honour and keep him,
in sickness and in health...

475
00:37:13,702 --> 00:37:15,778
"and forsaking all others...

476
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:19,454
"keep thee only unto him
as long as ye both shall live?"

477
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,995
I will.

478
00:37:23,253 --> 00:37:26,088
Who giveth this woman
to be married to this man?

479
00:37:26,173 --> 00:37:28,082
I do. Both.

480
00:37:29,343 --> 00:37:32,758
Say after me,
"I, Whitney Conway Ellsworth..."

481
00:37:33,472 --> 00:37:36,841
"I, Whitney Conway Ellsworth..."

482
00:37:37,184 --> 00:37:39,935
"...vow to love, cherish and protect..."

483
00:37:40,145 --> 00:37:42,814
"...vow to love, cherish and protect..."

484
00:37:42,898 --> 00:37:46,978
"...till death do us part,
according to God's holy ordinance..."

485
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:52,066
"...till death do us part,
according to God's holy ordinance..."

486
00:37:52,407 --> 00:37:55,361
"...and thereto I give to thee my troth."

487
00:37:55,577 --> 00:37:58,412
"...and thereto I give to thee my troth."

488
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:04,204
Say after me,
"I, Alma Russell Garret..."

489
00:38:06,295 --> 00:38:09,166
"I, Alma Russell Garret..."

490
00:38:09,465 --> 00:38:11,956
"...vow to love, cherish and obey..."

491
00:38:12,051 --> 00:38:15,005
"...vow to love, cherish and obey..."

492
00:38:15,096 --> 00:38:18,761
"...till death do us part,
according to God's holy ordinance..."

493
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:22,218
"...till death do us part,
according to God's holy ordinance..."

494
00:38:22,311 --> 00:38:25,063
"...and thereto I give to thee my troth."

495
00:38:25,147 --> 00:38:27,982
"...and thereto I give to thee my troth."

496
00:38:29,068 --> 00:38:30,443
The ring?

497
00:38:36,909 --> 00:38:39,150
"With this ring I thee wed."

498
00:38:41,371 --> 00:38:43,743
"With this ring I thee wed."

499
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:49,252
"Those whom God has joined together,
let no man put asunder."

500
00:38:50,046 --> 00:38:52,917
"For inasmuch as Alma and Whitney...

501
00:38:53,008 --> 00:38:55,712
"have consented together
in holy wedlock...

502
00:38:55,802 --> 00:38:59,634
"and have witnessed the same
before God and this company...

503
00:38:59,848 --> 00:39:04,593
"and thereto have given and pledged
their troth, each to the other...

504
00:39:05,353 --> 00:39:10,229
"and have declared the same by giving
and receiving a ring and joining hands...

505
00:39:10,942 --> 00:39:14,026
"I now pronounce
that they are man and wife."

506
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,206
We ask you all to join us...

507
00:39:30,294 --> 00:39:35,170
for collation and dancing
in the thoroughfare.

508
00:39:54,317 --> 00:39:55,516
Shit!

509
00:39:57,154 --> 00:39:59,941
- What's so fucking funny, Jenn?
- Nothing.

510
00:40:06,997 --> 00:40:11,409
Who are you fucking clapping orders at,
Wu? You only got us on loan.

511
00:40:15,338 --> 00:40:16,962
Oh, for Christ's sake!

512
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:20,215
I guess in for a penny,
in for a fucking pound.

513
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:21,796
Swearengen.

514
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:23,926
He wouldn't allow it
if I went up and ask him.

515
00:40:24,013 --> 00:40:25,294
Swearengen!

516
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,275
You wanna swap masks?

517
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:58,333
- What the fuck you looking at?
- I wasn't fucking looking at you!

518
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:14,137
Mr Ellsworth,
was I right about the gloves?

519
00:41:23,196 --> 00:41:26,150
Full and final payment, Mr Tolliver...

520
00:41:26,407 --> 00:41:30,405
for what service you conceive
you rendered me.

521
00:41:30,912 --> 00:41:35,206
The Lord himself would testify
to me having served you, Mr Hearst...

522
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:39,417
and to what should be my just reward.

523
00:41:41,714 --> 00:41:45,877
Is that the cocksucker addressing us
from the fucking whirlwind?

524
00:41:47,178 --> 00:41:50,593
"George Hearst, Cy's just reward...

525
00:41:51,473 --> 00:41:55,720
"every claim he helped you buy,
he's in for 5%.

526
00:41:57,187 --> 00:42:02,145
"Cy, as I'll sometimes
be busy elsewheres...

527
00:42:02,526 --> 00:42:06,310
"take your own fucking precautions
you're fairly treated.

528
00:42:06,738 --> 00:42:11,649
"Should George try to fuck you,
Wolcott's letter gets broad circulation."

529
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:15,620
Tell me what letter you mean.

530
00:42:17,082 --> 00:42:20,664
George asks
what letter you refer to, Lord.

531
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:29,501
"That you, Cy,
before you disposed of them whores...

532
00:42:29,594 --> 00:42:31,503
"made that murdering geologist write...

533
00:42:31,596 --> 00:42:35,428
"once he told you
George knew of his habits."

534
00:42:39,145 --> 00:42:41,814
Disturb you, being in the public eye?

535
00:42:42,398 --> 00:42:45,185
Some don't mind.
Fuck, some men like it.

536
00:42:46,027 --> 00:42:50,238
- But I wonder if you're among them.
- Stop moving your hand, sir.

537
00:42:51,073 --> 00:42:54,573
I mean you no harm,
but I can't speak for Captain Turner.

538
00:42:57,746 --> 00:43:00,700
"Put your hand down, Cy."
I hear you, Lord.

539
00:43:04,169 --> 00:43:08,463
The press being sold-out cunts,
it hardly matters that a story's true.

540
00:43:08,549 --> 00:43:10,541
But one like this, that is...

541
00:43:10,634 --> 00:43:14,003
sporting a man like you
and a fucked-up geologist...

542
00:43:14,096 --> 00:43:18,473
and whores dug up from shallow graves
with their throats slit from ear to ear...

543
00:43:18,558 --> 00:43:21,180
and the same to their poor privates.

544
00:43:21,603 --> 00:43:23,145
What's that, Lord?

545
00:43:24,523 --> 00:43:26,183
Would you, Lord?

546
00:43:26,274 --> 00:43:28,350
You dirty-minded cocksucker.

547
00:43:28,902 --> 00:43:32,235
He says
he'd follow a story like that himself.

548
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:40,366
5%. Your interests seen to
by one that controls his appetites.

549
00:43:57,638 --> 00:44:00,972
You'd first want to know from Wolcott
if there is a letter.

550
00:44:22,704 --> 00:44:25,741
You got your quiver full of words again,
don't you?

551
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:29,334
I found him in the woods.
All's he could say was, "I'm sorry."

552
00:44:34,382 --> 00:44:36,790
First I knew Andy,
all's he could say was, "Deal."

553
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:27,156
Davey,
tell Merrick to go ahead and print.

554
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:42,456
Fraught with contingencies, chief,
is our fucking electoral process.

555
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:46,548
Will His Holiness climb into a bottle
or pursue the widow, stiff-pricked...

556
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,673
the miles
to her Hot Springs honeymoon?

557
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,685
Who'll bear
the locals' banner then, huh?

558
00:47:33,391 --> 00:47:36,973
Most men, Andy, once they've brought
one fucking plague to the camp...

559
00:47:37,061 --> 00:47:38,638
would lay the fuck off.

560
00:47:38,729 --> 00:47:42,312
Not you!
No, you're gonna bible-talk my whores.

561
00:47:42,775 --> 00:47:44,898
God is not mocked, Cy.

562
00:47:45,778 --> 00:47:49,193
You've got a pestilence
for every fucking occasion!

563
00:47:49,782 --> 00:47:52,866
God is not mocked, you son of a bitch!

564
00:48:00,042 --> 00:48:02,615
He fucking gutted me.

565
00:48:02,711 --> 00:48:04,454
See to him, honey.

566
00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:08,165
I ain't gonna die.

567
00:48:10,927 --> 00:48:12,967
Don't let me die.

568
00:49:24,082 --> 00:49:26,039
Welcome the fuck back.

569
00:49:27,001 --> 00:49:29,041
- Miss Stubbs.
- Mr Utter.

570
00:49:32,215 --> 00:49:35,833
They dance on, chief,
however much at home...

571
00:49:36,552 --> 00:49:40,597
as at yours and mine,
comfort and love await.

572
00:49:48,564 --> 00:49:51,233
Unhurt, it appears.

573
00:49:51,942 --> 00:49:54,612
Don't hold for them
that went against us.

574
00:49:54,695 --> 00:49:56,818
I should hope fucking not.

575
00:49:59,241 --> 00:50:00,570
How'd he fight?

576
00:50:00,659 --> 00:50:03,862
He gave a good fucking account,
did Mr Wu.

577
00:50:04,455 --> 00:50:05,569
Lee?

578
00:50:06,123 --> 00:50:08,246
San Francisco cocksucker.

579
00:50:09,168 --> 00:50:10,959
Well done, then, men.

580
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:15,168
And well done, Adams.
The day's full course, indoors and out.

581
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:17,340
Thanks, thanks.

582
00:50:17,426 --> 00:50:19,169
You saved my bacon
in that fucking alley.

583
00:50:19,261 --> 00:50:21,419
- Jesus Christ!
- Fucking Adams.

584
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:28,804
- Swearengen!
- All right, Wu.

585
00:50:37,445 --> 00:50:40,066
Wu America!

586
00:50:40,531 --> 00:50:43,651
That'll hold you tight to her tit.

587
00:51:01,469 --> 00:51:05,383
Elections! Elections are coming!

588
00:51:05,598 --> 00:51:09,975
Territorial governor agrees
to local elections!

589
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,638
Elections are coming!

590
00:51:20,779 --> 00:51:23,780
Don't you have a fucking home
to get to?

591
00:52:37,896 --> 00:52:40,731
I believe it's to your fucking right.

592
00:52:42,317 --> 00:52:44,938
Hey, we ain't done fucking dancing!
