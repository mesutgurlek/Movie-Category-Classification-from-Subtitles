1
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,800
Hello.

2
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,600
- All right.
- Okay, come on.

3
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,100
Lupe, you've never been to a part\y

4
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,700
till you've been
to C.D.'s Christmas Eve part\y.

5
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,800
It will be busy?

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,600
Oh, everybody
and his dogs will be here.

7
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,900
You'll have to have an armored car
to carry away the tips.

8
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,000
Go inside, esé.

9
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,700
Come on.

10
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,000
Hey, compadre.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,500
We're not properly open yet, fellas.

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,500
You got us all wrong, amigo.

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,900
We're not here to drink.
We're here to help.

14
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,500
Is that a fact?

15
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,400
Yeah, there's been some bad trouble
in the neighborhood.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,600
So we're getting a collection together
to have a patrol.

17
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,500
That way nothing happens to you.

18
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,700
And your donation's
only a hundred dollars.

19
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,200
- Hundred dollars?
- Each week.

20
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,300
Oh, I don't think so.

21
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,400
What's that window wort\h to you?
And your customers?

22
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,900
Now, I'm sure you don't want
a bunch of greasy cholos

23
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,400
hassling them in the parking lot,
now, do you?

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,700
- Yeah.
- It's never been a problem before.

25
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,500
- Now, I get your point.
- Yeah, I thought you would.

26
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,800
Everybody pays, old man.
It's just better that way.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,600
Not everybody. You just back away.

28
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,200
You're making a big mistake,
old man.

29
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,400
No, no, you're the one
who's making a mistake.

30
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,400
Got nine lives?
Because you're gonna need them.

31
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,200
You come back around here
one more time

32
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,200
and I'll plant this shotgun
so deep in your butt

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,600
they'll hear the echoes in Houston.

34
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,300
Mr. Parker, you'd better call the police.
Those kids are very dangerous.

35
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh, no, no, no.
They just met up with the wrong man.

36
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,600
Can you get this kind of cleaned up,
hon, and put up some more garlands?

37
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,300
And I'm gonna
go get the ornaments.

38
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,700
Yessiree.

39
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Tra, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We can't let an old man
punk us out like that, esé.

41
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,000
Who said we're gonna?

42
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,900
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Tra, la, la, la, la, la, la...

43
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,800
Yeah, but Lupe's new.
You know, maybe she's overreacting.

44
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,000
Well, it won't hurt\ to look into it.
These gangs are bad news.

45
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,100
Yeah, you're right.

46
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,300
You know, when we were kids,

47
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,000
we used to duke it out,
one-on-one, right?

48
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,300
Sometimes, rarely, but sometimes
somebody would pull out a knife.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,900
Now these kids
got the cops outgunned.

50
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,100
It's C.D.

51
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,300
Dispatch, this is Trivette.

52
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,600
I need an ambulance in the alley
beside 429 Winston Street.

53
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,100
429 Winston Street.

54
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,200
Trivette, he's hurt\ bad.

55
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,200
So the way I figure this thing, Cordell,

56
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,200
the guys that tried to shake me down,
run me down.

57
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,000
- Did you see anything, C. D?
- See anything?

58
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Well, hell, no, I didn't see anything.

59
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,000
I just went across the alley,
singing a Christmas carol,

60
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,100
get the ornaments,
picked up the ornaments,

61
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,600
came back, went ass over teakettle.

62
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,800
Next thing I remember, the anvil
chorus is going off in my head.

63
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,900
Figure you're lucky to be alive,
Big Dog.

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,900
Then why don't I feel
that way about it?

65
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,300
I'm not gonna be able to go
to my Christmas part\y.

66
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,500
And that is damn import\ant to me.

67
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,300
C.D., Lupe can run the place
until you feel better.

68
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
She's right. What you need is rest.

69
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,300
That's not the point.
That's not the point at all.

70
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
All those punks hurt\ me
and put me in here.

71
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,200
Cordell, I could've took
any one of them

72
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,500
or all of them put together
with one hand tied behind me.

73
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,700
- There wasn't no question about that.
- Okay, just relax, C.D.

74
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,600
Trivette and I'll take care of this.

75
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,700
Let's go talk to the merchants
in the neighborhood.

76
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,100
If they tried to shake C.D. Down,
that means there had to be others.

77
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,800
- Nobody knows anything.
- Yeah, I know, they're all scared.

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Means something's going on.

79
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,800
Yeah, why don't you get
with Sal Ochoa

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,100
from the Gang CRASH Unit?

81
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,800
- See what you can dig up.
- You got it.

82
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,000
- I'll see you tomorrow after class.
- How's the class going?

83
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,000
- It's going really good.
- Think you can make any difference?

84
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,500
Well, most of these kids
are from broken homes.

85
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,700
They've already got
two strikes against them.

86
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,200
All I'm trying to do
is keep them from striking out.

87
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,700
We can only build so many prisons.

88
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,700
Yeah, you're right about that.

89
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,500
These kids are at a crossroads,
Trivette.

90
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,700
We've gotta get them
on the right path.

91
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,200
Taking this pretty personally,
aren't you?

92
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,100
Damn right I am.

93
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,900
Put your arms out there. Wait.

94
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,100
Okay.

95
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,100
All right, fall in.

96
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Ricardo.

97
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,500
- Where's your belt?
- I don't have it.

98
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,400
You know you've been training
for eight months. You're a purple belt.

99
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,600
You know you're supposed to have
your uniform and your belt at all times.

100
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,600
- Yes, sir.
- Then where's your belt?

101
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,200
My baby sister was killed
in a drive-by shooting,

102
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
and I put my belt in her coffin
for her to take to heaven.

103
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,000
Mr. Saenz, would you bring me
a purple belt, please?

104
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,600
Yes, sir.

105
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,000
- Okay, fall back into class.
- Yes, sir.

106
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,600
Thank you.

107
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,400
Mr. Saenz,
would you take over, please?

108
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,100
Yes, sir.

109
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,300
- What are we?
- We are a team, sir.

110
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,200
- T stand for?
- Truth, sir.

111
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,000
- E stand for?
- Esteem, sir.

112
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,700
- A stand for?
- Attitude, sir.

113
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,600
- M stands for?
- Motivation, sir.

114
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,700
Three others necessary
to be a great mart\ial art\ist.

115
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,200
- Number one?
- Discipline, sir.

116
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,900
- Number two?
- Respect, sir.

117
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,700
- Number three?
- Instrument, sir.

118
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,200
- What can you become?
- Anything I wanna be, sir.

119
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,000
- Why?
- Because I'm a winner, sir.

120
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,800
Is being a winner
some tiny thing?

121
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,200
No, sir. No tiny thing, sir.

122
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,900
On your stance.

123
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,500
Ready.

124
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,100
Kick. Kick.

125
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,200
Peace.

126
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,600
Jab.

127
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
Jab.

128
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,300
Now, when you punch,
don't reach with your shoulder.

129
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Keep your shoulder straight.
Now, punch.

130
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,000
Now, see how you're reaching?

131
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,800
See? See how he keeps
his body straight?

132
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,900
- You're dismissed.
- Thank you, sir.

133
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,400
- All right. See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

134
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,300
Later.

135
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,600
I know, I know.

136
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,800
Hey, Tommy.
You're looking real good out there.

137
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,300
Yes, sir. Ernesto's been helping me.

138
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,600
Well, he's the man to do it.
He was one of my best students.

139
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,300
- How's his job going?
- He just got promoted to manager.

140
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Getting him that job at Phil's Garage
is the best thing that happened to him.

141
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,700
The best thing that ever happened
to him was getting out of that gang.

142
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,300
How about you?
Are they hassling you?

143
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,000
No, sir.

144
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,300
Good.

145
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,600
Nope, nope.

146
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,700
Nope, nope.

147
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
How you feeling, C. D?

148
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,500
Cordell, I want out
of this tort\ure chamber.

149
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,500
Every time I look up,
they're drawing blood.

150
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,700
I'm tired and I hurt\. I want out.

151
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,500
You told me you're feeling better.

152
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,700
I don't feel wort\h a damn.
That's how I feel.

153
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,900
Any luck yet?

154
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,600
Nope, not yet.

155
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,300
Brother, when I spot him,
he's gonna stay spotted.

156
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,300
This is the guy, Cordell.

157
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,400
That's the one who tried
to put the bite on me, right there.

158
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,600
Sonny Port\illo, a.k.a. The Viper.

159
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,000
- Leader of the Vatos Locos.
- Where's he live?

160
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,700
Easy, C.D. Easy.

161
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,200
Just relax, C.D.
Leave Sonny Port\illo to me.

162
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,500
No. No.

163
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,400
But I only have 18 bucks, Ernesto.

164
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,900
Hey, that'll teach you
to blow your quart\ers on the arcade.

165
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,600
Hey, Ed, don't overt\ighten it.

166
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,500
I thought we were
into this together, man.

167
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,200
You were gonna get Mom
the candlesticks

168
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,800
and I was gonna get her
the tablecloth.

169
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,900
Hey, I already got her the candlesticks.
Hey, Ed, check the plugs on this.

170
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,800
Come on, Ernesto.

171
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,900
The one she wants costs 25 bucks.

172
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,400
I'm 7 bucks short\ and Christmas
is only three days away, man.

173
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,800
Calm down, man.
Listen, I'll tell you what.

174
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,500
You roll that barrel of oil
to the collection area,

175
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,800
then I'll lend you the 7 bucks.

176
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,300
- You got a deal.
- Hey, hey, don't forget,

177
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,300
we gotta pick out
that Christmas tree after work.

178
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,200
- All right.
- Okay? Hurry up.

179
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,900
How much longer?

180
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,900
Let's talk, homes.

181
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,300
I don't have anything
to say to you, man.

182
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,700
Come on, esé.

183
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,100
There's a war coming down.

184
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,300
You gotta be with us, homes.
We need you, esé.

185
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,900
Like I told them, man,
I don't wanna be with anybody.

186
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,500
Come on, homey,
gotta back up the barrio, esé.

187
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,300
Vatos Locos. We jumped them in.

188
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,200
Tonight's your initiation.

189
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,700
You could ride with us, esé,
against the Diamantes.

190
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,000
Hey, Tommy, everything okay?

191
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,000
Yeah.

192
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
Get back to the shop.

193
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,000
Do it.

194
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,900
Hey, I asked you
to stay away from Tommy.

195
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,300
Now, I'm telling you,
leave him alone.

196
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,100
Hey, homes,
we got jumped in together, esé.

197
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,400
You and me.

198
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,100
You got jumped out,
broke the covenant,

199
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,100
but I never gave you
any trouble about it, did I?

200
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,400
You don't want the clica, homes?

201
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,100
That's cool, esé. It's your choice.

202
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,100
But nothing's changed, homes.

203
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,800
- We still gotta back up the barrio.
- Hey, I changed.

204
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,300
Now Tommy's not getting into it,
and if you come near him again,

205
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,100
I'll take you apart\, esé,
right in front of the veteranos.

206
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,900
Don't get loud on me, cholito.

207
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,400
Yeah? And what
are you gonna do, esé?

208
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,000
Trust me, Ernie,

209
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,800
you don't wanna think about it.

210
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,900
Let's roll, esé.

211
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,200
Sonny Port\illo's been in more trouble
than John Dillinger,

212
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,200
but that was all before he was 18,
so we can't touch him.

213
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,200
- Why not?
- His juvenile jacket's been sealed.

214
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,000
Since he turned 19, the only thing
we've got him on is loitering.

215
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,500
The leader
of one of Fort\ Wort\h's biggest gangs

216
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,600
and all he's done is loiter?

217
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,600
Well, veteranos recruit
young cholitas and burros

218
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,900
to do their dirt\y work for them
and carry their guns.

219
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,000
- That's right.
- C.D. Identified him.

220
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,500
Yeah, but he didn't pay the extort\ion,
and he didn't see who ran him down.

221
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,800
I think I'll pick up
Sonny Port\illo anyway.

222
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,300
Won't be able to hold him,
but at least he'll know I'm in the hood.

223
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,900
Today you were ninos,

224
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,200
tonight you become veteranos.

225
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,700
Tonight we bleed the Diamantes.

226
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,900
Yeah! Now let's see
if those Diamantes

227
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,200
have the huevos to answer.

228
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,100
Yeah!

229
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,000
Hurry up.

230
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,500
Here, grab the end.
Grab the end, hurry up.

231
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,700
You came home?

232
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,200
Hi, Mom.

233
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,500
It's a beautiful tree.
It's even prettier than last year.

234
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,800
Hey, won't the angel
look great on top, Mom?

235
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,400
- Yeah.
- I get to put the angel on top this year.

236
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,900
Hey, you're always complaining.

237
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,100
No!

238
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,600
No! No!

239
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,400
No! Ernesto!

240
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,200
No! No! No!

241
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,000
Please God, no!

242
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,100
Los Diamantes,

243
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,200
they shot my brother.

244
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,600
Los Diamantes!

245
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,800
Tommy?

246
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,700
They shot Ernesto.

247
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,700
We were just carrying
the Christmas tree,

248
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,700
- and they shot him.
- Who shot him?

249
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,700
- The Diamantes.
- Are you sure?

250
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,000
They called it out,

251
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,100
and I recognized Guzman's wheels.

252
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,700
- I wish I had a gun.
- That's not the answer, Tommy.

253
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,800
I'll take care of the Diamantes.
Right now, your mother needs you.

254
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,800
She has a priest.

255
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,700
They can say a million Hail Marys
and they don't mean a thing.

256
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,900
They do mean a thing.

257
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,800
They mean a lot.

258
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,100
Mrs. Lopez,
your son's in the best of hands here.

259
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,700
It's in God's hands now.

260
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,500
Mrs. Lopez?

261
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,900
Your son's out of surgery.
He's in ICU.

262
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,800
- How is he?
- Well, he's critical. He's not conscious.

263
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,600
- Can I see him?
- Yes, sure.

264
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,900
Right there, for a few minutes.

265
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,900
First, we bury the placa,

266
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,700
then we bury the Vatos Locos.

267
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,800
By tomorrow night,
ain't nothing left, homes.

268
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:25,000
Hey, man, that Sonny Port\illo,
he's mine.

269
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:30,100
Man, that crab is gonna get wasted.

270
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,800
I'm taking you in, Guzman.

271
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,900
- What the hell for?
- For the shooting of Ernesto Lopez.

272
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,100
What? You ain't got nothing on me.

273
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,000
I got a positive ID on your car.

274
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Hey, Walker, he don't
got those wheels no more, man.

275
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,100
- They got ripped off.
- Did he report\ it stolen?

276
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,100
Yeah, I report\ed it.
Cops love me so much,

277
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,000
they dropped their doughnuts
just to find it.

278
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,000
I was with him, man, all last night.

279
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,900
We all were.

280
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,200
Then who shot Lopez?

281
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,400
- I don't know who did that.
- That's not good enough, Paco.

282
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,100
Walker, man,
you're the one cop that I respect.

283
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,000
You've always been straight with us,
man. I'm being straight with you.

284
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,700
I don't know who did that.

285
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,000
Your turf was shot up last night.
You had to answer.

286
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,400
And we will answer.
We got a war coming on.

287
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,200
We got all these crabs moving in:

288
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,500
Port\illo, Vatos Locos.

289
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,600
But we gotta keep what's ours,
and we didn't start\ it.

290
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,500
And Guzman,
he did not shoot Ernesto.

291
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,900
- Okay, I'll believe you for now.
- Look, man, I wouldn't lie to you.

292
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,700
And I won't lie to you, Paco.

293
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,700
You start\ a war,

294
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,000
and I'll come down on you
like a hammer.

295
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,400
Hey, man,
we can't let Port\illo punk us out.

296
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,400
Guzman's right.
What are we supposed to do?

297
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,600
Nothing. I'll take care
of the Vatos Locos.

298
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,100
All right, all right.

299
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,800
- We'll stay on our turf.
- What?

300
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,200
But if they come here again,

301
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,900
there's gonna be a war.

302
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,300
Fair enough.

303
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,900
Hey, vato, this is a private club,
and we don't allow no visitors, esé.

304
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,500
You wanna piece of me too?

305
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,100
Hey.

306
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
- Who the hell are you?
- Your next nightmare, Sonny.

307
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,100
Walker, right?

308
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,800
I'm impressed, esé.

309
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,600
I must be somebody really import\ant,
que no?

310
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,800
- You got that right.
- I make exceptions for cockroaches.

311
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,600
I'm taking you in for extort\ion

312
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,400
and the attempted murder
of C.D. Parker.

313
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,000
The only thing you're missing, esé,

314
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,900
is the army it's gonna take
to pull that off.

315
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,100
I'm all the army
I'm gonna need, Sonny.

316
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,100
Come on.

317
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,900
Tell your veteranos
to make a path, Sonny,

318
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,600
or I'm gonna get real upset.

319
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,700
Clear the way, homeys.
They ain't got nothing on me.

320
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,400
I'll be out in two hours, locos.

321
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,800
Hey, Sonny, see you soon.

322
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,800
Hey, homes, call Rudy Figueroa.
Tell him to earn his keep.

323
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,300
Okay.

324
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,900
Got it, man.

325
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,100
I asked the bart\ender
for a donation to my youth club.

326
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,200
He took it wrong.
Threatened me with a shotgun.

327
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,500
You know,
I'm thinking of filing charges.

328
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,400
- You ran him down.
- No way, man.

329
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,400
I was kicking it with my homeys.
Ask any of them.

330
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,600
They rat, you cut their tongues out.

331
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,100
I've known you 10 years

332
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,800
and a day doesn't go by
I don't regret it.

333
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
We got you this time, vato.

334
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,400
Hey, Ochoa,
tell your sister I said hello.

335
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,200
Hey, hey, hey. Easy, Sal.
He's not wort\h it, man.

336
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,400
Walker, he made bail.
You're gonna have to cut him loose.

337
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,000
You booked me, now I'm booking.

338
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,900
I love this country.

339
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,600
You'll be back, Sonny.

340
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,000
Next time, you won't leave.

341
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,200
You come into my barrio again, esé,
maybe you don't leave.

342
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,900
There was a day you could
cut him off at the ankles for that.

343
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,600
I want his head, Trivette,
not his feet.

344
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,700
Mrs. Lopez, how's Ernesto doing?

345
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,900
There's no change.

346
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,600
Well, he's a strong boy.
He'll make it.

347
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
If it's God's will.

348
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,500
How's Tommy taking it?

349
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,300
I don't know about Tommy.

350
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,600
I have a son who's dying,

351
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,800
a son that I thought
had rose above all of it.

352
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,700
Ernesto has risen above it.

353
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,300
And now he's fighting for his life.

354
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,300
You don't understand,
Ranger Walker.

355
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,800
They never stop.
They're never out of it.

356
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,700
The machismo.

357
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,100
The blood for blood.

358
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,600
And the sisters

359
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,400
and the daughters and the mothers,

360
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,900
we can't do anything
but stand on the sidelines and weep.

361
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,900
I know it isn't easy, Mrs. Lopez.

362
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,400
You know,
we try and hold our families together.

363
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,600
We try and educate them,

364
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,400
and we try and keep them
out of gangs.

365
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,200
And we hope
and we pray every night

366
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,700
that when we come home,
they're still alive.

367
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,700
And then we bury them,

368
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,900
and life goes on,

369
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,200
until the next one dies.

370
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,300
- That won't happen to Tommy.
- It's too late.

371
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,700
I saw his eyes.

372
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,500
I know that look.

373
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,200
Look, he's in my class today.
I'll talk to him, okay?

374
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,900
Thank you.

375
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,300
Thank you, he respects you.
Thank you.

376
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,400
Manolo, wait for me.

377
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,500
Ernesto will be okay,
Tommy. Really.

378
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,500
Just shut up, Carlos, okay?

379
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,500
Hey, Tommy.
Hey, what's up, homey?

380
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,000
How you doing, man?

381
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,700
What's up, man?
Hey, how's your brother doing?

382
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,800
I tried to warn him, man.
I told you it was all coming down.

383
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,500
- How is he, man?
- Bad.

384
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,200
He should've stayed with us.

385
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,500
We could've protected him.

386
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,000
But now it's blood for blood.

387
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
You with us?

388
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,400
No. I don't know.

389
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,800
You want vengeance, don't you?
It's natural, loco.

390
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,900
You wanna get down for what's yours.
We can help you.

391
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yeah, but...

392
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,600
What, somebody told you not to?
We stand for our own, esé.

393
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,300
Who does that priest stand for?
And what's that Ranger telling you?

394
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,600
Do nothing?
Wuss out on your brother?

395
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,400
Even the Bible says
an eye for an eye, loco.

396
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,100
You need to bleed
the Diamonds, Tommy.

397
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,800
If you don't avenge your brother,
you're nobody.

398
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,100
- I know, man, but...
- You can join us, esé.

399
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,100
You can be Vatos Locos.

400
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
Are you down, esé?

401
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,600
Yeah, I'm down.

402
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,300
- Let's go, homey.
- Tommy, no.

403
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,800
What's up, homes? Yeah, let's go.

404
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,700
- Yeah.
- All you want is to get them, right?

405
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,700
- Whatever.
- Are you a real menace?

406
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,400
- Move back.
- Take it. Hey, take it.

407
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,700
Yeah.

408
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,400
- Get him.
- Let him have it.

409
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,700
Come on, come on.

410
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,200
All right.

411
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,400
Hey, hey, all right, all right, all right.

412
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,800
That's enough, that's enough.

413
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,200
What's up, dog? Little homey,
you're a good fighter, esé.

414
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,700
You got the fire.

415
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,600
Hey, let's welcome
our new homey to our clica.

416
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,700
- All right.
- Blood for blood, esé.

417
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,700
- All right.
- Vato Loco now.

418
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,700
- Where's Tommy, Carlos?
- He isn't here.

419
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,200
I know he isn't here.
Do you know where he is?

420
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,600
I think he's getting
jumped into the Vatos Locos.

421
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,900
Tommy.

422
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,900
- What happened?
- I fell down.

423
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,000
Right, and six or seven veteranos
fell right on top of you, right?

424
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,700
You know,
if you go in that direction,

425
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,800
you're gonna wind up in prison,
or worse.

426
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,400
I gotta stand up for what's mine.
For Ernesto.

427
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,600
- Port\illo says...
- Port\illo's a coward.

428
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,800
Your brother's a man.
It takes a man to stay out of the gang.

429
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,700
Ernesto has tubes in his nose.

430
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,400
He doesn't even know
he's peeing in a plastic bag.

431
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,100
If he was your brother,
what would you do?

432
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,900
It's not about me, Tommy.
It's about the rest of the your life.

433
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,000
And the decision you make now

434
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,700
is going to affect it forever.

435
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,600
But it is your choice.
I can't make it for you.

436
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,300
That's right, Ranger Walker.
You can't.

437
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,100
It's been great working for C.D.

438
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,000
You've done a great job
holding down the fort\.

439
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,000
Thanks, Alex.

440
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,900
- Hey.
- Hey. Anything from Forensics?

441
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,400
They're still sifting through all that
Ernesto Lopez crime-scene evidence.

442
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,500
Can't ID the slug
till they dig it out of him.

443
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
Which they can't do
until he wakes up.

444
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,500
How's it look?

445
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,300
His vital signs are improving,
but you know how that could go.

446
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,400
Jimmy, I thought Cordell
was coming with you.

447
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,900
He's poking around
on his own, C.D.

448
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,700
Oh, man.

449
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,700
Yeah, I guess he's taking this
mighty personal

450
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,200
because I was a victim
of those guys.

451
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,700
- What's the matter, Walker?
- I think I lost a kid today.

452
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,400
- The one you were worried about?
- Tommy Lopez.

453
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,700
Hey, guys,

454
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,800
I got a new Vatos Locos member
you might be interested in.

455
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,500
Here he is.

456
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,400
Yeah, they jumped him in
this morning.

457
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,500
- Sal, I want you to do me a favor.
- Sure, just name it.

458
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,000
I want you to hold onto that picture,
at least for a while.

459
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,200
He hasn't done anything wrong yet.

460
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,400
Okay, Walker,
but I think you're barking at the moon.

461
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,300
I hope not.

462
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,600
- Hey, Tommy, you scared?
- Yeah, a little.

463
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,600
I'm not. We're gonna toast them.

464
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,700
Hey, you haven't seen me, okay?

465
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,100
Hey, boys,
have you seen Tommy Lopez?

466
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,700
- Tommy who?
- You know who.

467
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,000
Hey, if you see him, tell him...

468
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Mrs. Lopez.

469
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,600
Ernesto regained consciousness.
They're operating on him right now.

470
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,700
Dios, it's wonderful.

471
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,400
Do you know where Tommy is?
I've looked everywhere for him.

472
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,700
No, I'm sorry.

473
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,700
You should be there when
he gets out of surgery. I'll take you.

474
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,300
I can't, I have to work.

475
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
I've talked to your supervisor.
Everything's okay.

476
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,000
- Oh, thank you, thank you.
- Let's go.

477
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,200
Okay.

478
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,600
We'll cover for you.

479
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,200
By noon tomorrow,
I want their placa buried.

480
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,500
Yeah!

481
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,800
Yeah, I'm start\ing the war,
and it's on tonight at Belvedere Park.

482
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,900
All right.

483
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,900
Deep in the heart\
of the Diamonds' territory.

484
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,400
- Tonight?
- Yeah, tonight.

485
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,200
- What, you got a problem with that?
- It's Christmas Eve.

486
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,800
That's right, esé,

487
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:23,600
and by tomorrow morning, 20 blocks
of the barrio will have a new savior.

488
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,800
Yeah!

489
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,200
So, what's the word, mockingbird?

490
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,800
Are you ready to get down
for your own?

491
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,400
Are you ready to cap Guzman
for what he did to your brother?

492
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,300
It's all I've been waiting for, esé.

493
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,400
It's on dog. Let's roll.

494
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,700
Hey, Walker, you wanna come
take a look at this?

495
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,700
This is the bullet the doctors pulled
out of Ernesto Lopez this morning,

496
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,900
and that's one they pulled
out of the wounded Diamante

497
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,200
after his turf was shot up.

498
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,700
Both bullets are from the same gun.

499
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,800
Man, we've been looking
for two shooters and there's only one.

500
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,200
- What do you make of it?
- Sonny Port\illo did both shootings.

501
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,700
- Why?
- Start\ a gang war.

502
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,400
And to recruit Tommy Lopez.

503
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,300
Well, it's working so far.
How's Ernesto doing?

504
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,900
Oh, he's doing good.
They expect a full recovery.

505
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,500
- Did you tell Tommy?
- No, I can't find him anywhere.

506
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,500
Hey, guys.

507
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,600
- Thank God, there you are.
- What's shaking, Sal?

508
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,300
The whole damn planet, Jimmy.

509
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,100
Vatos Locos
smothered Diamante placa,

510
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,400
even in their own backyard.

511
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,800
- What's placa?
- Gang graffiti.

512
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,100
Graffiti to you. Jungle drums to me.

513
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,700
From the stockyards to city hall,
there isn't a wall

514
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,600
that doesn't have a Vatos Locos slap
in the Diamantes face.

515
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,100
To tell the truth, I don't know
what's holding the Diamantes back.

516
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,800
I think I do.
Paco made me a promise.

517
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,100
I bet that promise
is on thin ice, Walker.

518
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,000
It's gonna go down,
I don't know where or when,

519
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,600
but I can guarantee
it'll make the evening news.

520
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,300
- Where you going?
- Stop a war.

521
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,500
They jumped our fence.

522
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,200
- Now we're gonna bury them.
- Yeah!

523
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,100
I hate Vatos Locos,
worse than any of you,

524
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,400
but I gave my word.

525
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,700
You gave your word to the law, esé.

526
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,000
But it was my word.

527
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,800
Next time,
you give it to someone that counts.

528
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,100
You made me a promise, Paco.

529
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,900
Walker, there is only so much
we can take, man.

530
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,100
It's blood for blood,
and it's long past due.

531
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,600
Give me an hour,
then you can have your war.

532
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,400
No deal, man. If we don't show up
at Belvedere Park,

533
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,000
no Diamante
will ever get respect again.

534
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,100
- No, it's his way.
- That's right.

535
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,900
Either I lead the Diamantes,
or I end it all right here.

536
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,600
Now, what's it gonna be, homeys?

537
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,100
One hour, Ranger. You got one hour.

538
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,000
A minute more,

539
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,300
Vatos Locos blood
is gonna spill in the gutter.

540
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,400
- That's all I need.
- How are you gonna pull that off?

541
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,100
Sonny Port\illo wants a war,

542
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,500
he's got one.

543
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
Hey, locos.

544
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,200
The Diamantes aren't coming,
Port\illo,

545
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,800
so your war
is gonna have to be with me.

546
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,100
You? That's a joke.

547
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,300
You're under arrest.

548
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,700
Hey, esé, you can't book me
for the same thing twice.

549
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,900
This time it's for attempted murder.

550
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,900
You tried to kill Ernesto Lopez
and blame it on the Diamantes.

551
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,400
- Sonny?
- Cops are born liars, esé.

552
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,700
You can't prove it.

553
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,000
The gun in your hand will prove it.

554
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,300
Tommy, your brother
was operated on this morning.

555
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,100
He's gonna be okay.
Now, step away.

556
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,800
Stay where you are, man.

557
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,100
You want my bullets, Walker?

558
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,200
I'm gonna give you
the whole damn clip.

559
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,500
That part\ner of yours
has the heart\ of a lion.

560
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,100
Yeah, and the brain of a rock.

561
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,900
Come on, Sonny, cap the bastard.

562
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,800
This is bad, esé.

563
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,400
You gotta do something, carnal,

564
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,500
or nobody never gonna
follow you again, man.

565
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,500
Come on, Sonny, shoot.

566
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,200
Of course, killing a cop
will get you the electric chair.

567
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,100
All right, I'll make you a deal.

568
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
You and your veteranos take me on.

569
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,700
If you can beat me,

570
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'll let you go.

571
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,500
Let me get this straight.

572
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,200
You fight all of us.
If we win, you let us go?

573
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,900
That's the deal.

574
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,400
What the hell is Walker doing?

575
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,100
He's trying to save the young ones.

576
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,300
Let's take him down, homeys.

577
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,300
- Get your hands on him.
- Come on.

578
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,500
Hit him.

579
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,500
- Watch out, man.
- Gotta lay it out, man.

580
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,800
Drop it or use it, Sonny.

581
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,200
- You're a dead man, Walker.
- Watch out, man.

582
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,000
Cap him.

583
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:40,000
Do it. Francisco, Diego,
you're Vatos Locos, esé.

584
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,500
If you don't cap him now,
you'll never become veteranos.

585
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,400
Do it for the neighborhood.

586
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,500
Kill him now!

587
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,900
The choice you boys make right now
will affect the rest of your lives.

588
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,600
Be sure it's the right one.

589
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,600
Hey, come on, let's go.

590
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,200
All right. Hey.

591
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,700
All right, don't move.
Put your hands up.

592
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,600
- Weapons down.
- Down on the floor, please.

593
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,000
Weapons down.

594
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,300
Ranger Walker? Sonny's gun.

595
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,200
Wanna log it in?

596
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,300
Come on, Tommy.

597
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,600
Let's go wish your mom and brother
a Merry Christmas.

598
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,000
Raoul Ramirez.

599
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
Lillian Agear.

600
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,200
Tommy Lopez.

601
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,600
These belts don't come easy.

602
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,800
You have to earn them.

603
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,000
You're all winners. Never forget that.

604
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,400
- Class dismissed.
- Thank you, sir.

605
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,400
All right.

606
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Yo, Tommy.

607
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,700
I'm so proud of you.

608
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,800
Ernesto, Mrs. Lopez.

609
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Thank you so much for not giving up
on him, Ranger Walker.

610
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,800
He's a good kid. I was glad to help.

611
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,500
Me too. I almost blew it big time.

612
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,200
Yeah, but you didn't, Tommy.
That's all that matters.

613
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,100
Ranger Walker, would it be okay
if we joined your class?

614
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,500
- You know the rules.
- No drugs, no gangs.

615
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,300
Okay, Tommy,
go get them suited up.

616
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,100
Drugs and gangs, man,
that's the big problem.

617
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,600
How do we ever hope to solve it?

618
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,400
One kid at a time, Trivette.

619
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,000
